Act. No. 22-301-RGA  \n: \nLT. JOHN FAULKNER , et al.,  : \n: \nDefendant s.  : \n \n MEMORANDUM  \n1. Introduction.  Plaintiff Augustus Hebrew Evans, Jr. ( \u201cPlaintiff \u201d), SBI No. \n191247, an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, \nfiled this complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  1983 alleging violations of his constitutional \nrights  and raising supplemental state claim s.  He proceeds pro se  and moves  for leave \nto proceed in forma pauperis.1  (D.I. 1).  The Court once again considers Plaintiff\u2019s  \nmotion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis . \n 2. Legal Standards .  The Prison Litigation Reform Act ( \u201cPLRA \u201d) provides \nthat a  prisoner cannot bring a new civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action in \nforma pauperis  if he has three or more times in the past, while incarcerated, brought a \ncivil action or appeal in federal court that was dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.  See Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 455- 56 \n(3d Cir. 2014) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and discussing what qualifies as a strike \n \n1 This Court denied the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis  and ordered \nPlaintiff to provide a sworn statement regarding settlement monies he received in 2020.   \n(D.I. 8).  P laintiff\u2019s filing indicates that  those monies are \u201cdeleted.\u201d  (D.I. 9).   I am \nsatisfied he is properly claiming IFP status.  Case 1:22-cv-00301-RGA   Document 10   Filed 05/06/22   Page 1 of 3 PageID #: 131 \n 2 under the PLRA).  A case dismissed as frivolous prior to the enactment of the PLRA \n(i.e., April 26, 1996) is counted when applying the \u201c three strikes rule. \u201d  Keener v. \nPennsylvania Bd. of Probation & Parol e, 128 F.3d 143 (3d Cir. 1997).  An exception is \nmade to the \u201c three strikes rule\u201d , when the prisoner is in imminent danger of serious \nphysical injury.  A prisoner who is not proceeding in forma pauperis  may file a new civil \naction or appeal even if that pr isoner has three or more dismissals described in 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).  \n3. Background.  Plaintiff, while incarcerated, has filed twenty -six cases, \nabout twenty -four of which I would call  civil actions, and more than three of the  civil \nactions  have been dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim upon which relief \nmay be granted.  See, e.g., Evans v. Graves, Civ. Act. No. 17 -54-RGA, D.I. 15 (D. Del. \nJune 12, 2017) (dismissed as frivolous) ; Evans v. Seaford Police Dep\u2019 t, Civ. No. 11 -\n195-LPS (D. Del. Apr. 3, 2012) (dismissed as frivolous); Evans v. Wright , Civ. No. 07 -\n656-JJF, (D. Del. Feb. 21, 2008) (dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief \nmay be granted); Evans v. McMillan , Civ. No. 07 -591-JJF (D. Del. Dec. 10, 2007) \n(dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted); and Evans v. Sussex Correctional Inst ., Civ. No. 92 -619-LOT (D. Del. June \n13, 1993).   Therefore, Plaintiff may not file another civil action in forma  pauperis  while \nincarcerated unless he is in \u201c imminent danger of serious physical injury \u201d at the time of \nthe filing of his complaint.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); Abdul -Akbar v. McKelvie , 239 F.3d \n307, 311 (3d Cir. 2001).   Plaintiff concedes that the three strikes rule applies to him.  \n(D.I. 5 at 1).  Case 1:22-cv-00301-RGA   Document 10   Filed 05/06/22   Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 132 \n 3 4. In addition to the Complaint, Plaintiff filed  a declaration regarding imminent \ndanger.  (D.I. 5).  After reviewing the  Complaint  and declaration, the Court concludes \nthat Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that at time of the filing of the complaint he was \nunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.  See Williams v. Forte , 135 F. App \u2019x \n520 (3d Cir. 2005) (allegations of lack of medical treatment satisfy threshold criterion of \nthe imm inent danger exception); Abdul -Akbar v. McKelvie , 239 F.3d 307, 311 (3d Cir. \n2001)  (en banc).   Plaintiff alleges that  when  he was moved from a single cell to a cell in \nmedium security , he advised prison personnel that he must be housed alone.  Instead, \na cellmate was placed in his cell , and the cellie attac ked and injured Plaintiff.  Plaintiff \nalleges that the cellmate was placed in his  cell in retal iation by Defendants .  Plaintiff \nreceived mental health treatment on numerous occasions during the relevant t ime-\nframe.  Plaintiff was ultimately moved to maximum security and is housed alone .  \nPlaintiff does not allege \u201cimminent harm\u201d.  Rather, he complains of his fear of future \nretaliation .  This  does not meet the threshold criterion of the imminent danger \nexce ption.   Based upon the foregoing, Plaintiff is not excused from the restrictions \nunder \u00a7 1915(g), and he may not proceed in forma pauperis .   \nTHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED this 6th day of May that: \n1. Plaintiff is DENIED leave to proceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 1).  \n2. Plaintiff is given thirty (30) days from the date of this Order to pay the \n$402.00 filing fee.  If Plaintiff does not pay the filing fee within that time, the Complaint \nshall be dismissed pursuant to 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).   \n \n       /s/ Richard G.
