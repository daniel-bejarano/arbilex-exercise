(\"Komatsu\")'s \nmotions for summary judgment (D.1. 390,394) and Caterpillar's motion to exclude the report and \nte~timony of Dr. Jeffrey Leitzinger (D.I. 392). I held oral argument on August 18, 2022, and I have \nconsidered the parties' briefing and supplemental letters. (D.1. 391,418,433,395,416,432,393, \n414,436,451,452,453,454). \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Procedural History \nOn January 29, 2015, International Construction Products LLC (\"ICP\") brought an action \nagainst Caterpillar, Komatsu, Volvo Construction Equipment North America LLC (\"Volvo\"), and \n.Associated Auction Services LLC (\"Cat Auction\") for unreasonable restraint of trade under \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act; exclusive dealing under Section 3 of the Clayton Act; monopoly, \nI \nattempted monopoly, and conspiracy to monopolize under Section 2 of the Sherman Act; unlawful \n1\u00a5erger under Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act; and state law claims \nfor civil conspiracy, tortious interference with contract, and tortious interference with prospective \nbusiness relations. (D.I. 1). On January 21, 2016, I granted Defendants' motions to dismiss all \nclaims, dismissing the monopoly and unlawful merger claims with prejudice. (D.1. 45, 46). \nICP filed an amended complaint on February 4, 2015, bringing revised claims against the \nsame defendants for unreasonable restraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act; exclusive \ndealing under Section 3 of the Clayton Act; and state law claims for civil conspiracy, tortious \ninterference with contract, and tortious interference with prospective business relations. (D.1. 48). \nOn August 22, 2016, I dismissed ICP's exclusive dealing claims. (D.I. 64, 65). On December 1, \n2017, I granted the parties' stipulation to dismiss ICP's claims against Volvo. (D.I. 147) \n2 On September 26, 2018, I granted ICP's motion for leave to file its Second Amended \nComplaint (D.I. 162) adding three Caterpillar equipment dealers, Ring Power Corporation (\"Ring \nPower\"), Ziegler, Inc. (\"Ziegler\"), and Thompson Tractor Company, Inc. (\"Thompson\"), as \ndefendants. (D.I. 160, 161). On October 10, 2019, I dismissed ICP's claims against Ring Power, \nZiegler, and Thompson for lack of personal jurisdiction, dismissed ICP's antitrust claims against \nCat Auction with prejudice, and dismissed ICP's state law claims against Cat Auction without \nprejudice. (D.I. 237, 238). \nOn December 24, 2019, ICP filed its Third Amended Complaint, bringing claims of \nunreasonable restraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act against Caterpillar and \nKomatsu, and state law claims of aiding and abetting, civil conspiracy, tortious interference with \ncontract, and tortious interference with prospective business relations against Caterpillar, \nKomatsu, and Cat Auction. (D.I. 246). On August 10, 2020, I dismissed all claims against Cat \nAuction, as well as the claims of aiding and abetting, civil conspiracy and tortious interference \nwith prospective business relations against Caterpillar and Komatsu. (D.1. 292, 293). That same \nday, I granted ICP's motion for reargument regarding the dismissal of the three dealer defendants \n(D.I. 242) and transferred ICP's claims against the dealer defendants to the Northern District of \nFlorida. (D.I. 294, 295). I simultaneously denied ICP's motion to transfer its claims against \nCaterpillar and Komatsu to the Northern District of Florida. (D.I. 244). Jd \nFinally, on August 11, 2020, I granted Caterpillar's motion to strike allegations that the \nmerger between IronPlanet and Cat Auction was unlawful from ICP's Third Amended Complaint. \n(D.1. 296, 297). \n3 The only remaining claims in this case are (1) ICP's claim against Caterpillar and Komatsu \nfor unreasonable restraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and (2) ICP's state law \nclaim against Caterpillar and Komatsu for tortious interference with contract. \nB. Factual Background \nIn 2013-14, Caterpillar was the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining \nequipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives, -\nwith 2013 sales and revenue totaling $55.7 billion. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 4 at 1). Caterpillar, through its \n\"Construction Industries\" division, was the largest manufacturer of heavy equipment sold \n~orldwide in 2013-14. (Id at A-107; D.I. 399-1 Ex. 6 ,r 25). In 2013, Caterpillar's Construction \nIndustries division reported total North American sales and revenues of $7 billion. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. \n4 at A-107). Komatsu was also a leading manufacturer and seller of heavy construction equipment. \n(Id at 2; D.I. 399-1 Ex. 6 ,r 26). In 2014, Caterpillar's and Komatsu's shares of the U.S. heavy \nconstruction equipment manufacturing market were 23% and 4%, respectively. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 6 \n,r'25, 26). \nRather than sell directly to end-user customers, Caterpillar sold its new heavy equipment \nthrough a network of independently owned dealers. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 4 at 7; D.I. 419-1 at 23:6-24, \n25:19-21 (Levenick); D.I. 399-1 Ex. 8 at 182:3-20 (Guilford)). These dealers offered end-users \nequipment service support and parts. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 6 ,r 33). In 2014, Ring Power was one of \nCaterpillar's largest dealers, with its headquarters in St. Augustine, Florida, and locations in north \nand central Florida. (D.I. 419-19 at 33:2-6 (Fowler); D.I. 396-1 Ex. 1 ,r 17). Thompson was a \nCaterpillar dealer with locations in Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. (D.I. 419-20 at -69-70).1 \nZiegler was a Caterpillar dealer with locations in Minnesota and Iowa. (D.I. 419-21). \n1,When the cited pagination has a\"-\" in front of it, the cite is referring to a Bates number. \n4 Caterpillar sold used equipment through two of its subsidiaries, Cat Financial and \u00b7 \nCaterpillar Used Equipment Services Inc. (\"CUESI\"). (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 6 ,r,r 30-32). Cat Financial's \nprimary business was providing retail and wholesale financing for purchases of Caterpillar \nproducts, but it occasionally sold repossessed financed equipment or off-lease equipment returned \nfrom customers who did not purchase the equipment after the lease's expiration. (Id ,r 30). CUESI \nsupported the used equipment business of Caterpillar's dealers, e.g., by purchasing back unsold \nequipment from dealers, and it would occasionally assist Cat Financial in its sales of repossessed \nor off-lease equipment. (Id ,r 31; D.I. 399-1 Ex. 8 at 32:17-34:11 (Guilford)). \nCat Financial and CUESI utilized a \"cascade\" strategy to sell used equipment, offering it \nfirst to its dealers and then to auction houses. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 8 at 34:4-35:6). The auction houses \nincluded Cat Auction, IronPlanet, and Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. (\"Ritchie Bros.\"). (Id. at \n35:4-6). Cat Financial and CUESI sold roughly $9.3 million worth of used Caterpillar equipment \nthrough Cat Auction and $6. 7 million worth of used Caterpillar equipment through IronPlanet on \naverage each year from 2013 to early 2015. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 6 at 20). \nCat Auction was formed in 2008 by Ziegler and other Caterpillar dealers to provide an \nauction service for customers and dealers. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 5 at -664; D.I. 419-8 at -009; D.I. 419-\n2 at 13 :7-20 (Hoeft)). By 2014, Caterpillar had amassed the largest ownership stake in Cat Auction \n(29.8%), which included a \"strike right,\" i.e., the ability to veto any change in control of the \ncompany, and held one board seat, filled by Pablo Koziner, Caterpillar's Vice President of its \nAmericas Distribution Services Division. (D.I. 399-2 Ex. 16 at 61:10-18 (Hoeft), Ex. 17 at 23). \nThe remaining 70.2% of Cat Auction was owned by twenty-five Caterpillar dealers, with Ziegler \nholding 7.5%. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 5 at -664; D.I. 419-10 at -793). Cat Auction operated at a loss from \n5 2010-2013, and in 2013 reported $8.9 million in revenue and an EBITDA of -$2.7 million. (D.I. \n399-1 Ex. 5 at -672). \nIronPlanet operated an exclusively online platform for selling and auctioning used heavy \nconstruction equipment. (D.I. 419-12 at -037). In 2013, IronPlanet reported a total revenue of$58.3 \nmillion and an EBITDA of -$3.4 million. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 5 at -707). Sales from Cat Financial and \nCUESI were responsible for 1.2% oflronPlanet's total revenue in 2013. (D.I. 399-2 Ex. 19 at 16). \nSales from Komatsu were responsible for 0.2% of lronPlanet's total revenue in 2013, and sales \nfrom Ring Power were responsible for 0.9%. (Id. at 15-16). Thompson was a \"small seller\" for \nIronPlanet. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 3 at 99:17-22 (Owens)). As of April 24, 2014, Caterpillar was \nIronPlanet's third-largest shareholder, at9.45%, and Komatsu its fifth, at 7.3%. (D.I. 419-15). Ring \nPower also owned IronPlanet stock (0.55%), as did its then-President and CEO, Randy Ringhaver \n(q.09%), and then-Senior Vice President of Used Sales and of its Heavy Equipment Division, \nFrank Fowler (0.09%). (Id.). \nBy the end of 2013, Cat Auction had approached IronPlanet about the possibility of \nIronPlanet acquiring Cat Auction, and the two had begun discussions regarding a potential merger. \n(D.I. 419-25 at -1287-88; D.I. 419-3 at 133:11-23 (Guilford)). Caterpillar \"pushed\" for the \npotential \"marriage\" for multiple reasons. (D.I. 419-25 at -1287). First, Caterpillar recognized that \nCat Auction was doing poorly financially and faced a choice between considering \"a merger with \nsomeone\" or \"go[ing] out of business.\" (Id.; D.I. 419-3 at 131 :15-132:23). Second, Caterpillar was \nconcerned about competition to its dealers from Ritchie Bros., and, third, Caterpillar desired \"more \n~arket intelligence into used equipment\" and saw a merger with IronPlanet as an \"opportunity for \nmarketing to buyers of [Caterpillar's] used equipment.\" (D.I. 419-25 at -1287). In lieu of a cash \npurchase, Cat Auction's vision for the merger was for it to create a \"true partnership\" in which Cat \n6 Auction would acquire an ownership stake in IronPlanet. (Id at-1287-88). IronPlanet and its board \nviewed the potential transaction as an opportunity to obtain \"exclusivity\" over used Caterpillar \nequipment going to auction. (Id). \nBy February of 2014, Cat Auction had engaged the firm Greene Holcomb & Fisher LLC \n(''.GHF\") to act as its financial advisor for its potential merger with IronPlanet. (D.I. 419-30). At a \nFebruary 28, 2014 Cat Auction board meeting, the board resolved to have its CEO, Gary Trettel, \nits Chairman of the Board, Bill Hoeft (who also served as the CEO of Ziegler), its counsel, Bill \nKlein, and representatives from GHF, including Kent Adams, begin negotiating a Letter of Intent \nWith IronPlanet. (Id.). \nIn October 2013, Tim Frank, ICP's CEO and founder, first contacted IronPlanet about the \npossibility ofironPlanet assisting ICP in implementing its vision for an \"online direct sales model\" \nof distribution for Chinese-manufactured, new heavy construction equipment in North America. \n(D.I. 419-24). Because ICP was a new entrant in the heavy construction equipment market and did \nnot have an established network of equipment dealers, IronPlanet's online sales platform was \n\"critical\" to ICP' s business. (D.I. 419-23 at 59:5-7 (Frank)). \n1. Monday, March 3 -Friday, March 7 \nOn Monday, March 3, 2014, ICP and IronPlanet signed a Hosted Store Agreement in which \nIronPlanet agreed to \"develop, operate, and maintain\" a section of its website featuring and \noffering ICP's new equipment for sale directly to customers. (D.I. 399-3 Ex. 28 at 1). The Hosted \nStore Agreement had an initial term of one year, followed by automatic renewal for up to two \nsuccessive one-year terms, unless either party gave ninety days' written notice prior to the start of \nthe new term. (Id at 5). The Agreement included a \"Termination for Cause\" provision, which \nallowed either party to terminate the Agreement upon giving thirty days' written notice \"if the \n7 other party breaches any material provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within \nsuch thirty (30) day period.\" (Id). \nThe following day, March 4, 2014, ICP's store went live on IronPlanet's website and on \nMarch 5, ICP announced its partnership with IronPlanet publicly at ConExpo, a large industry \ntrade show. (D.I. 399-3 Ex. 29; D.I. 419-39). \nThat Friday, March 7, 2014, IronPlanet received a \"Customer Care\" online chat inquiry \nabout one of the pieces of ICP equipment listed for sale on its website from a person working at \nCUESI asking, \"can this be imported US?\" and, \"do you have a list of dealers in midwest that I \ncan have warranty work done?\" (D.I. 419-49). \n2. Monday, March 10-Friday, March 14 \nOn Monday, March 10, IronPlanet's head of development, Jeff Barca-Hall, informed \nlronPlanet's President of Sales, Jeff Jeter, of the Caterpillar Customer Care inquiry, noting, ''you \nmight be interested in the fact that there has been some 'sniffing around' by Caterpillar in response \nto seeing the ICP items on our site.\" (Id). \nThe next day, Tuesday, March 11, Richard Longbottom, Caterpillar's Marketing Liaison \nfor Cat Auction, sent Gary Trettel, Cat Auction's CEO, a link to an article about ICP's ConExpo \nlaunch which announced, \"ICP's first partnership with a Chinese manufacturer is with Lonking,\" \nand, \"The up to 40 percent price differential between [Chinese-manufactured] machines and \nestablished brands would turn most buyer's [sic] heads.\" (D.I. 419-45). \nOn Thursday, March 13, Greg Owens, IronPlanet's CEO, sent a revised offer for the \nIronPlanet/Cat Auction merger to Bill Hoeft, Ziegler's CEO and the Chair of Cat Auction's board. \n(D.I. 399-3 Ex. 24 at -83). The next day, Friday March 14, Cat Auction's Gary Trettel informed \n8 Rick Albin, Cat Auction's Executive VP, of the offer from Owens, and Albin responded, \"Thanks \nfor the up date. Something has changed.\" (D.1. 419-51). \nThat same day, in response to the news of Owens's revised offer, Kent Adams, managing \ndirector of GHF (Cat Auctions's financial advisor), sent Gary Trettel, Bill Hoeft, and Mark Allen, \na Ziegler employee and Cat Auction board member, an email noting, \"I know there is a new \n'overhang' with Caterpillar re: Iron Planet's business arrangement with International Construction \nProducts that could abort any potential for a transaction,\" and, \"It would be good to know (and to \nsee) the proposed Caterpillar letter being drafted to go out to Dealers in regards to more support \nfor [Cat Auction]. This is a piece ofleverage for us, potentially.\" (D.I. 419-28 at-89). In that email, \nAdams also included a draft response to Owens, which stated, \n(Ic;l.). On a side note, we and Caterpillar noted the recent article in Equipment World \nwhich highlighted Iron Planet's new relationship with International Construction \nProducts. Without more full understanding, I have a strong suspicion that such a \nrelationship would kill any hope of a transaction between Iron Planet and Cat \nAuction Services from Caterpillar's perspective. \nThe same day, Jerome Guilford, Caterpillar's General Manager of Lifecycle Products and \nServices, sent an email to Caterpillar's Richard Longbottom, Pablo Koziner (VP of Americas \nDistribution Services Division and board member of Cat Auction), and Steve Gosselin (VP of \nCustomer Services Support) about the ICP/IronPlanet partnership, saying, \nThis will not help with our discussions with [IronPlanet], don't think we want a \nstrategic alliance with a company that now selling new Chinese equipment into the \nUS. This is a show stopper. \nThis is the type of disruption we were worried about but thought it would be Ritchie \nBros. with a Chinese equipment company figuring out how to compete here without \ninvesting in a strong distribution network. \n(D.1. 419-50 at -36). \n9 Gosselin responded, \"Absolutely agree .... show stopper,\" and, \"DDBA .... dead deal \nbefore arrival!\" (Id. at -35). Longbottom responded, \"I came across the article and told the 'Carbon \nnegotiating team' [Cat Auction's internal name for the team negotiating the merger between \nIronPlanet and Cat Auction] our deal is dead, if what I was reading is true,\" although he had not \nyet informed IronPlanet' s Greg Owens, adding, \"I agree with dead deal, but what if we could \nensure he cancels this arrangement and we govern and manage all future OEM arrangements ... \", \n\"Should we consider or even go there, or leave it as dead deal before arrival!\" (Id. at -34-35). \n3. Monday, March 17 -Friday, March 21 \nOn Monday, March 17, in response to Adams' emails regarding Owens' revised offer and \nthe IronPlanet/ICP news, Gary Trettel emailed Adams. Trettel wrote, \"Between you and I,\" noting \nhe would update Richard Longbottom \"verbally\" who would then update Pablo Koziner, \"CAT is \nconcerned about the ICP deal more than the percentage and would like us to figure out the \n[IronPlanet] plan before going further but without killing the deal now.\" (D.I. 419-28 at -86). That \nsame day, Koziner wrote to Adams and others at Caterpillar, \"the recent announcements regarding \nIP's distribution of new Chinese machines has a material impact in our strategy going forward,\" \nand, \"Given my responsibilities as a board member of [ Cat Auction] I cannot comment further but \nhave copied Steve Gosselin on this email who can speak with you more openly on the subject.\" \n(D.I. 419-53 at -199). \nOn Tuesday, March 18, Koziner wrote to Caterpillar's Edward Rapp regarding the \nIronPlanet/ICP news, \"It would appear that the objectives by the Chinese companies to engage \nwith [IronPlanet]: 1) reflect the challenge of establishing a distribution channel in NA; and 2) their \ndesire to position Chinese machines/products as an attractive alternative to used,\" and, \n10 \"Positioning new vs. used is one way the Chinese equipment providers have tempted customers to \nmove away from premium brands elsewhere in the world.\" (Id at-198). \nThat same day, Bill Hoeft responded to Greg Owens's revised merger offer, noting, \nOn a side note, we, and Caterpillar, noted the recent article in Equipment World, \nwhich highlighted Iron Planet's new relationship with International Construction \nProducts. We would like to better understand that relationship, as we are concerned \nthat Caterpillar and the CAT dealers would have significant concerns about any \narrangement where Iron Planet is providing auction services for new equipment for \na Caterpillar competitor. \n(D.I. 399-3 Ex. 24 at -83). \n4. Monday, March 24 -Friday, March 28 \nOn Wednesday, March 26, the financial advisor, Adams, sent Gary Trettel, Cat Auction's \nCEO, a draft letter for Bill Hoeft to send Greg Owens regarding the status of the IronPlanet/Cat \nAuction merger negotiations. (D.I. 419-54; D.I. 419-55). The draft letter emphasized that Cat \nAuction's proposed valuation placed \"a substantial premium on [Cat Auction]\" that \"can be \njustified based on the long-term value that Caterpillar and its dealers will be bringing to the table.\" \n(D.I. 419-55 at -82). The draft letter highlighted the \"incredible strength\" of Caterpillar's dealer \nnetwork \"that will bring substantial opportunity to the combined entity under the CAT brand,\" \nnoting, \"CAT is the global leader, and CAT has the ability to both leverage its global strength, or, \nalternatively, provide leverage against IP ifwe are to go our separate ways.\" (Id. at -81). \nThat same day, at 3 :20 pm, Tim Tri pas, Vice President of Operations for Komatsu' s captive \nfinance company, spoke on the phone with IronPlanet's Greg Owens for 26 minutes. (D.I. 419-56 \nat-59). Later that day, IronPlanet's President of Sales, Jeff Jeter, emailed IronPlanet's General \nCounsel, \"So, ICP news has generated some interest w our friends.\" (D.I. 419-57 at -59). Feick \nresponded, \"Weird but seems so. Greg thinks, and I see no evidence otherwise, that ICP is what \nspurred some renewed interest/reactiveness in finding a way to get something done.\" (Id). \n11 The next day, Thursday, March 27, Komatsu's Kent Van Zanten emailed Komatsu's \nDirector of Remarketing, Lee Haak, with whom Tripas testified he \"was in constant \ncommunication,\" a link to a listing for LonKing equipment available on IronPlanet's website. (D.I. \n419-58; D.I. 419-7 at41:19-20 (Tripas)). \n5. Monday, March 31-Friday, April 2 \nOn Monday, March 31, IronPlanet's Greg Owens sent Cat Auction's Gary Trettel a revised \nproposal for the IronPlanet/Cat Auction merger. (D.I. 399-4 Ex. 31 at -102-04). In this proposal, \nOwens estimated the total volume of used equipment \"from the Cat family\" consigned to either \nCat Auction or IronPlanet in 2013, commenting, \nWe have calculated that there is sufficiently more volume than this currently being \nsold through auctions each year in North America alone from the Cat family, so if \nCat is backing this combined entity with their volume and not sending to [Ritchie \nBros.], the dealers in North America alone could produce this incremental volume. \n(Id. at-103). \nLater that day, Komatsu's Tim Tripas called Greg Owens; the call lasted less than one \nminute. (D.I. 429-28 at -060). \nThat evening, Caterpillar's Cat Auction liaison, Richard Longbottom, forwarded Owens' s \nproposal of earlier that day to Caterpillar's Pablo Koziner, noting, \nGary received this proposal from Greg Owens regarding ownership. Greg says if \nwe can come to some for[m] of agreement, then the ICP initiative would go away. \nI am trying to get a handle on how much our dealers actually place on auctions, \nunfortunately it seems that nobody is keeping track of this anymore. \n(D.I. 399-4 Ex. 31 at -102). \nOwens did not mention ICP anywhere in his March 31 email to Gary Trettel or the \naccompanying written proposal. (Id at -103-04). \n12 The next day, Tuesday, April 1, Ring Power's Senior Vice President Frank Fowler sent an \nemail with the subject line, \"*Confidential: Iron Planet,\" to Randy Ringhaver, Ring Power's CEO, \nand others, announcing, \nAs I reported at the board meeting, Iron Planet is offering new Chinese equipment \nfor sale on their web site. \nI also have heard they are trying to sell to end users through their field salesmen. If \nso, not good. I spoke to Jerome [Guilford] last night and he indicated Cat is not \nhappy with what they have seen and heard as well. \nJerome also told me Peter Blake from Ritchie was trying to set up a meeting with \nCat to discuss how they could possibly work together. \nAs soon as I confirm all the rumors I will call Greg Owens to verify and find out \nwhat is going on. Probably tomorrow. \n(D.I. 419-61). \nThe following day, Wednesday, April 2, kicked off a series of phone calls in quick \nsuccession among representatives from Caterpillar, its dealers, and IronPlanet. \nAt 12:14 pm, Ring Power's Frank Fowler spoke on the phone with Thompson's Used \nEquipment buyer, Billy Seals, for a little over two minutes. (D.I. 419-62 at -386, lines 306-07). \nTwo hours later, at 2:18 pm, Fowler spoke with IronPlanet's Greg Owens for a little over twenty \nminutes. (Id, line 317). \nAt 4:58 pm, Fowler called Caterpillar's Richard Longbottom and their phones were \nconnected for around twenty seconds. (D.I. 419-63 at 3, lines 96-97). Starting at 6:28 pm, Fowler \nexchanged phone calls with Thompson's Used Equipment Manager Richard Lindley multiple \ntimes over the course of an hour, (D.I. 419-64 at -417, lines 2890, 2892, 2895), speaking with him \nat least once. At 7 :29 pm, after Fowler and Lindley' s calls, Caterpillar's Longbottom called Fowler \nagain and the two spoke for around four minutes. (D.I. 419-62 at -386, lines 331-33). \n13 Finally, later that night, Fowler called IronPlanet's Greg Owens, and the two spoke for ten \nminutes. (D.I. 419-56 at -061). Owens then immediately called IronPlanet's President of Sales, \nJ~ff Jeter, and its General Counsel, Doug Feick. (Id.). Owens then called Fowler a final time. (Id.). \nThe next day, Thursday, April 3, IronPlanet's head of development, Jeff Barca-Hall sent \nan email to Jeter, Owens, and Feick, with the subject line \"ICP items are no longer visible on \nIronPlanet, but can still be purchased via ICPDirect.com,\" informing them, \nThe ICP items are no longer visible on our site. The ICP Store and its homepage \nbanner are gone. All ICP items have been removed from users' Watch Lists. \nWe are still hooked-up to process purchases from ICPDirect, but we've done \neverything we can to hide that fact. ICP buyers can only make a purchase from \nICPDirect.com and they now go directly to our \"Confirm Purchase\" page when \nthey press ICP's \"Buy Now\" button, never seeing an IronPlanet item page. (The \nfirst thing you see is an IronPlanet login prompt, which certainly reveals that we \nare still processing their sales, but can't be helped). The same thing will happen if \nsomeone with an old bookmark tries to view one of those item pages. We have also \nsubmitted a request to Google and Bing to forget they ever found any ICP-related \npages on our site (but we may still show up in their searches for about 24-48 hours). \nNote that our logo and our name (\" .. .IronPlanet, our partner site ... \") are still \npresent on the product pages ofICPDirect.com. \n-JBH \n(D.I. 419-65). \nThat evening, Barca-Hall forwarded the above email to a team of IronPlanet employees, \nsaying, \"Thank you all for the scramble these past few hours to react to this sudden decision. Nice \nteamwork and creative problem-solving to implement a quick, safe, and effective solution!'' (Id.). \nDoug Feick responded to Barca-Hall's email, \"and much thanks to you for calm, \ncommanding decision making. appreciate working with you and your ability to turn on a dime.\" \n(Id.). Barca-Hall responded, \"Remember, it's called 'pivoting'. :-)\". (Id.). \nEarly the next morning, Friday, April 4, IronPlanet's VP of Sales, Frank Langham, sent an \nemail to several IronPlanet employees, including Bob Winnete, IronPlanet' s territory manager for \n14 Northern Alabama and Eastern Tennessee, informing them, \"I've been informed that the ICP \ninitiative has been suspended. This is all the information I have at this point. Stay tuned for \nfurther updates.\" (D.I. 419-66 (emphasis .in original)). Winnette immediately forwarded \nLangham's email to Thompson's Richard Lindley, saying, \"This is all I have so far ... stay tuned\". \n(Id). Lindley then forwarded the email to Thompson's Kenny Bishop. (Id). \nThat same morning, Friday April 4, the day after IronPlanet removed ICP's items from its \nwebsite, Jeff Jeter informed ICP's Tim Frank for the first time that IronPlanet was considering \nterminating its relationship with ICP. (D.1. 419-68; D.I. 419-23 at 49:24-52:8 (Frank)). Frank \ntestified in his deposition that the substance of that phone call was as follows: \nHe called and said that we have a problem, that Cat and at least one other \nmanufacturer had called earlier in the day and were putting pressure on he and Greg \nto terminate their contract with us or they would stop doing business with them on \nthe equipment side. He apologized and said we are going to discuss this today and \nI'll get back to you. \n(D.I. 419-23 at 50:16-22). \nJeter summarized the contents of that same phone call with Frank in an 8:30 am email to \nGreg Owens and Doug Feick: \nTalked w Tim this am: \n-not happy, concerned, wanted to know next steps, but not an emotional \nconversation \n-understands pressure and said he suspects will be hard to brush off if they \nare serious \n-said he would talk to Wes now re alternative paths \n-said if wind down would need the 90 days I think support -did not get into \ndetails but think this could just be support on their site as now re closing \ntransaction- not mkt facing on ours \n-said confidentially this he thinks he is going to get some of Terex \nconstruction line -not including A WP, ie Genie -asked to pls keep this \nquite[sic] \n-told him I would follow-up ASAP re next steps \n(D.1. 419-68). \n15 That evening, Frank followed up with Jeter, sending an email with the subject line, \"Any \nnews before I fly off in the morning?\" (D.I. 419-69). Jeter responded he did not have any news, to \nwhich Frank replied, \n(Id). I am in China tomorrow thru Thursday evening Jeff, but if Cat is going to make \nyou pull the plug on us, I would like to know as soon as possible to make other \narrangements, even whe[ n] traveling. Could you email me? As you can appreciate \nthe timing isn't good. \nJeter forwarded Frank's response to IronPlanet's Greg Owens and Doug Feick, noting, \"So, \nI assume I need to tell him definitively he needs to start making alternative plans and we will \ndiscuss how to support him in a transition. Thoughts I other positioning?\" (Id). \n6. Monday, April 7-Friday, April 11 \nThe following Monday, April 7, IronPlanet's Bob Winnette sent an email to IronPlanet's \nGeorge Massey, stating, \"Update on Thompson. We need a statement from Owens, Jeter, or \nLangharri with our status & where we are headed if anywhere with ICP,\" adding, \"Until we have \na statement Richard/Thompson is in the holding pattern with us.\" (D.I. 419-70 at -18). Massey \nforwarded Winnette's email to IronPlanet's Frank Langham, saying, \"Thompson is wanting proof \nthat the ICP deal is dead.\" (D.I. 419-75 at -88). Langham emailed Jeff Jeter to ask, \"What's our \nofficial position/where are with ICP initiative? Need to relay to Thompson,\" (D.I. 419-70 at -18), \nadding, \"We're pitching a deal with Thompson/have Proposal on their desk or I wouldn't be \nconcerned with our 'stance'. Let me know your thoughts re: how we should respond .... appears \nthey are looking for a statement from you, Owens or me.\" (D.I. 419-75 at -88). Jeter responded, \n\"Our deal with ICP has been terminated and removed from the IronPlanet website.\" (D.I. 419-70 \nat -17). \n16 Langham forwarded Jeter's email statement to Massey, who sent it to Thompson's Richard \nLindley, noting, \"If you don't know who Jeff Jeter is he is VP.\" (Id. at -16). Lindley responded, \n\"Can Jeff send me a word document on Iron Planet letterhead with this statement? It will need his \nname and title at the end.\" (Id). IronPlanet complied with Lindley's request the next day, Tuesday \nApril 8, and sent Lindley a \"formal termination letter ending our relationship with ICP \nEquipment.\" (Id at -15). \nLindley forwarded this termination letter to his superior at Thompson, Kenny Bishop,2 \nadding, \"Attached is Iron Planet's letter stating their termination of an agreement with ICP. Can \nwe proceed with our plans to sell to Iron Planet and follow through with our plans for May in \nDestin?\" (Id.). Bishop replied, \"yes\". (Id). \nThat same day, a few hours after IronPlanet had supplied Thompson with the \"formal \ntermination letter\" regarding its relationship with ICP, IronPlanet's Jeter informed ICP's Tim \nFrank via email, \nUnfortunately IronPlanet will not be able to support ICP efforts going forward. I \nwill work with the IronPlanet Team on a transition solution as you look for \nalternative platform solutions in addition to your Dealer search/ outreach. Will give \nyou another update tomorrow and for now the IronPlanet site remains live on the \nICP site and will forward any inquiries as before. \nSpeak again tomorrow. \nJeff \n(D.I. 419-79). \n2 A few months later, on June 3, 2014, Bishop sent an email to Caterpillar's Stephan \nDowning with a link to ICP's website, http://icpdirect.com/, writing, \"This Is the company that \nshowed up on Iron Planet's website. After much uproar from Cat dealers they took it off. This \nmarketing idea may be using technology to be disruptive.\" (D.I. 419-89). \n17 A few days later, on Thursday, April 10, Frank responded to Jeter, saying, \"I understand \ntp.at the outside forces involved are quite powerful. That said, I'm very concerned and upset at Iron \nPlanet's decision.\" (D.I. 419-81). Jeter responded, \"Will call you this afternoon if ok\". (Id). \nThe following day, Friday, April 11, Jeter sent Frank a formal termination letter, \naccompanied by the note, \"Sorry didn't reach you today -your voice mail was full. Will try again \ntomorrow, but wanted to go ahead and get this in your hands as soon as possible. Want to discuss \nhow we can make transition as smooth as possible.\" (D.I. 399-3 Ex. 30). \nThe termination letter stated, \"Pursuant to our conversation on April 4, 2014, the purpose \nof this letter is to provide written notification and confirmation of IronPlanet' s termination of the \nHosted Store Agreement between [IronPlanet and ICP] dated March 3, 2014.\" (Id). The letter \ninformed ICP IronPlanet had \"removed the Hosted Store and all ICP links, marks, and branding \nfrom IronPlanet's site,\" and requested \"that [ICP] do the same in regard to IronPlanet's marks, \nbranding and APis on the ICPDirect site as soon as possible.\" (Id). The letter closed by saying, \n\"We regret this unfortunate circumstance and will do all we can to provide an orderly transition to \na new platform.\" (Id). \nAt the time lronPlanet terminated its agreement with ICP, approximately one month after \nICP's store went live on lronPlanet's platform, ICP had made one heavy construction equipment \nsale. (D.1. 399-1 Ex. 1 at 42:4-10 (Frank); D.I. 399-3 Ex. 25 at 109:7-110:5 (Barca-Hall)). The \none sale was \"nowhere what we were expecting.\" (D.I. 399-3 Ex. 25 at 110:4-5). \n7. Monday, April 14-Friday, April 18 \nThe following Wednesday, April 16, IronPlanet's Jeter called ICP's Frank. Frank \nsummarized the contents of that phone call in his deposition as follows, \nSo he called and we had it scheduled, so we were sort of at the, wanted to talk to \nhim about it. He apologized, said that this was wrong, that the pressure that they \n18 were under was very strong. At that point I did ask who besides Caterpillar was \nputting the pressure on them, and he said, \"You know who our investors are.\" And \nI asked again for specific names, and he just said, \"you know who our investors \nare.\" \n(D.I. 419-23 at 78:17-25). \nLater that day, Komatsu's Tim Tripas called IronPlanet's Owens and their phones were \nconnected for less than a minute. (D.I. 419-56 at -064). Owens later emailed Caterpillar's David \nShurson, saying, \"You have probably heard, meant to send you and email last week, but we \ndiscontinued our program with ICP\". (D.I. 419-83). Shurson responded, \"Yes, I heard. Good \ndecision.\" (Id.). \nThe following morning, Thursday, April 17, Tripas called Owens and they spoke on the \nphone for around 16 minutes. (D.I. 419-56 at -064). \n8. Deposition Testimony \nIronPlanet's CEO, Greg Owens, testified that IronPlanet terminated its agreement with ICP \nbecause, \"we were not getting traction and we had significant other opportunities and other \ninitiatives that we were pursuing, and I go with -my job is to create shareholder value,\" \"we \nweren't getting any -we weren't getting any traction with them. It was -we were putting time, \neffort, resources. I got senior-level people on my team tied up, and we're not -virtually not selling \nanything at all,\" \"That's what I recall. We were -it's all about volume with us, and we were not \nproducing volume.\" (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 3 at 139:-10, 93:4-9, 95:2-4). \nIn their depositions, all the Caterpillar witnesses denied communicating with Komatsu \nabout IronPlanet, ICP, or anything else. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 9 at 214:20-217:9 (Levenick); D.I. 399-4 \nE:~. 32 at 190:16-21 (Rapp); D.I. 399-4 Ex. 33 at 186:2-6, 191:8-13 (Gosselin); D.I. 399-2 Ex. 15 \nat 169:11-13, 211 :14-17 (Longbottom); D.I. 399-1 Ex. 10 at 221:8-20 (Koziner); D.I. 399-1 Ex. 8 \nat 330:13-22, 334:4-8 (Guilford); D.I. 399-2 Ex. 14 at 219:21-220:3 (Adams); D.I. 399-2 Ex. 12 \n19 at 82:13-21, 83:24-84:3 (Shurson)). Tim Tripas, the only Komatsu fact witness to be deposed, \ntestified he was not aware of any agreement between Komatsu and Caterpillar to threaten \nIronPlanet. (D.I. 399-4 Ex. 34 at 74:8-12). \nIn their depositions, Caterpillar's Levenick, Rapp, Gosselin, Longbottom, Koziner, \nGuilford, Shurson, and GHF' s Adams all denied the existence of an agreement between Caterpillar \nand Thompson, Ring Power, or Ziegler regarding ICP. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 9 at 214:20-215:25, 217:3-\n9 (Levenick); D.I. 399-4 Ex. 32 at 182:8-10, 190:16-191:5 (Rapp); D.I. 399-4 Ex. 33 at 186:10-\n13, 190:12-24 (Gosselin); D.I. 399-2 Ex. 15 at 169:6-10, 211:23-212:24 (Gosselin); D.I. 399-1 Ex. \n10 at221 :21-25, 223:2-8 224:2-13; D.I. 399-1 Ex. 8 at 330:19-331 :7, 332:3-13, 333:2-8 (Guilford); \nD.I. 399-2 Ex. 12 at 82:22-83:6 (Shurson); D.I. 399-2 Ex. 14 at 220:4-7, 221:8-16 (Adams)). \nIn their depositions, Ring Power's Randy Ringhaver and Frank Fowler denied the existence \nof an agreement between Ring Power and Caterpillar regarding ICP. (D .I. 3 99-4 Ex. 3 5 at 198 :20-\n199:5 (Ringhaver); D.I. 399-4 Ex. 36 at 144:6-12, 152:9-15, 152:21-153:8 (Fowler)). \nIn their depositions, Thompson's Michael Rooney, Richard Lindley, and Kenny Bishop \ndenied the existence of an agreement between Thompson and Caterpillar regarding I CP. (D .I. 3 99-\n4 Ex. 37 at 204:4-205:18, 206:3-4 (Rooney); D.I. 399-4 Ex. 38 at 143:17-24, 144:14-17 (Lindley); \nD.L 399-4 Ex. 39 at 85:18-86:2 (Bishop)). \nBill Hoeft, Ziegler's president and CEO and Cat Auction's chairman of the board, denied \ndiscussing ICP with anyone from Caterpillar. (D.I. 399-2 Ex. 16 at 42:18-21, 45:19-25). \nGHF's Kent Adams testified he did not remember ever discussing ICP with Caterpillar's \nRichard Longbottom and was not aware of any agreement between Caterpillar and anyone to \nwithhold used equipment from IronPlanet. (D.I. 399-4 Ex. 40 at 61:6-9, 85:22-86:4). \n20 Finally, IronPlanet's Greg Owens, Jeff Jeter, Frank Langham, George Massey, and Bob \nWinnette testified they were not aware of an agreement among Caterpillar and its dealers to \nwithhold used equipment from IronPlanet. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 3 at 141:6-17 (Owens); D.I. 399-2 Ex. \n18 at 232:6-17 (Jeter); D.I. 399-5 Ex. 41 at 164:8-20, 170:11-24 (Langham); D.I. 399-2 Ex. 20 at \n107:8-21); D.I. 399-5 Ex. 42 at 128:5-19 (Winnette)). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Summary Judgment \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. Lamont \nv. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242,248 (1986)). \"[A] dispute about a 1;11aterial fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is sufficient \nto, permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. The burden on the \nmoving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of \nevidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 \n(1986). \nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue \nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); Williams \nv. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving party \nasserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to \nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored \ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations ... , admissions, interrogatory answers, or other \nmaterials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish the \n21 absence ... of a genuine dispute .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(l). The non-moving party's evidence \n\"must amount to more than a scintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than \na preponderance.\" Williams, 891 F.2d at 461. \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences \nin that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the non-moving party \nfails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to which it has \nthe burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw. See Celotex Corp., \n477 U.S. at 322. \nThe Supreme Court has instructed, \"We believe that summary procedures should be used \nsparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is \nlargely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot.\" Poller v. \nColumbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc., 368 U.S. 464,473 (1962). \n\"[I]f the opponent has exceeded the 'mere scintilla' threshold and has offered a genuine \nis~ue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant' s version of events against the \nopponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent.\" Big \nApple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). \nB. Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act provides, \"Every contract, combination in the form of trust \nor:otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with \nforeign nations, is declared to be illegal.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. \"Despite its broad language, Section 1 \nonly prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade.\" In re Flat \nGlass Antitrust Litig., 385 F.3d 350, 356 (3d Cir. 2004). \n22 Thus, to prevail on a Section 1 claim, a plaintiff must prove two elements: (1) ''that the \ndefendant was a party to a 'contract, combination ... or conspiracy,'\" and (2) \"that the conspiracy \nto which the defendant was a party imposed an unreasonable restraint on trade.\" Toledo Mack \nSales & Serv., Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 530 F.3d 204,218 (3d Cir. 2008). \nID. DISCUSSION \nA. Collateral Estoppel \nDefendants argue that the Northern District of Florida District Court's opinion, Int'! \nConstr. Prods. v. Ring Power Corp., 2021 WL 6755717 (N.D. Fla. Dec. 23, 2021), granting \nsummary judgment to the dealers, Ring Power, Thompson, and Ziegler, precludes me from \nconsidering various issues in this case, including whether Defendants conspired with the dealers \nand whether certain evidence should be excluded as hearsay. (D.I. 433 at 5-7; D.I. 432 at 1, 3). \nCollateral estoppel3 prevents parties from relitigating an issue that has already been \nlitigated, where \"(1) the issue sought to be precluded is the same as that involved in the prior \naction; (2) that issue was actually litigated; (3) it was determined by a final and valid judgment; \nand (4) the determination was essential to the prior judgment.\" Peloro v. United States, 488 F.3d \n163, 174-75 (3d Cir. 2007) (cleaned up). \n3 Traditionally, collateral estoppel also required \"mutuality,\" that is, that the parties in the \nprior action be the same as the parties in the action in which estoppel is being asserted. Peloro v. \nUS, 488 F.3d 163, 175 (3d Cir. 2007). The doctrine has since shifted to allow \"non-mutual\" \npreclusion, where \"a litigant may also be estopped from advancing a position that he or she has \npresented and lost in a prior proceeding against a different adversary.\" Id. \nNon-mutual collateral estoppel can be asserted either offensively, that is, by a plaintiff, or \ndefensively, as it is here, by a defendant. For defensive collateral estoppel to apply, \"the party to \u00b7 \nbe precluded must have had a 'full and fair' opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action.\" Id. \n(citing Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322,328,332 (1979) and Blonder-Tongue Labs., \nInc. v. Univ. of Ill. Found., 402 U.S. 313,331,333 (1971)). \n23 Here, I do not think I am collaterally estopped from reaching my own independent \nconclusions, because the issues before me now are different than the ones decided by the Florida \nCourt. The theory of ICP'_s case against Caterpillar and Komatsu in this action is not the same as \nthe theory of its case against Ring Power, Thompson, and Ziegler in that action. In its opinion \ngranting summary judgment, the Florida Court defined the \"fairly simple question\" before it as, \n\"Did [Ring Power, Thompson, and Ziegler] conspire to keep Plaintiff out of the heavy construction \nequipment sales market in North America by threatening to withhold their used equipment from \nthe online auction site that Plaintiff had contracted with to sell its new equipment?\" Int 'I Constr. \nProds., 2021 WL 6755717, at *l. \nHere, the questions are different. The issues before me now are (1) whether Caterpillar \nand/or Komatsu conspired to remove ICP as a competitor in the new heavy construction equipment \nmarket by participating in a coordinated pressure campaign against IronPlanet to compel it to \nterminate its relationship with ICP, and (2) whether IronPlanet terminated its relationship with ICP \nin response to that pressure, thereby joining the conspiracy. The Florida Court's finding that there \nwas insufficient evidence to show that the dealers agreed to threaten to withhold equipment from \nIronPlanet does not preclude a finding that Caterpillar and/or Komatsu conspired with some or all \nof the dealers to pressure IronPlanet in various ways, including but not limited to threatening to \nwithhold business from IronPlanet until it agreed to terminate its partnership with ICP. \nMoreover, the Florida Court's determination regarding the admissibility of hearsay \nevidence was premised on its finding that IronPlanet was not a coconspirator with the dealers in \nthat alleged conspiracy. Id at *4 n.6. That conclusion does not preclude a finding that IronPlanet \nmay have been a coconspirator with Caterpillar and/or Komatsu and/or the dealers in the \nconspiracy at issue here. \n24 B. Antitrust Claim \nTo survive summary judgment on its Sherman Act Section 1 claim, ICP must show there \n', \nis genuine dispute of material fact as to (1) whether Defendants were party to a conspiracy, and \n(2) whether that conspiracy imposed an unreasonable restraint on trade. Toledo Mack Sales & \nSe-rv., Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 530 F.3d 204,218 (3d Cir. 2008). I will consider each element in \nturn. \n1. Concerted Action \n\"The existence of an agreement is the very essence of a section 1 claim.\" In re Flat Glass, \n385 F.3d at 356 (cleaned up). \"Unilateral activity, no matter what its motivation, cannot give rise \nto a\u00a7 1 violation, D because a manufacturer 'has the right to deal, or refuse to deal, with whomever \nit likes, as long as it does so independently.\"' Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 465 \n(3d Cir. 1998) (quoting Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Se-rv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761 (1984)). \nAccordingly, courts have construed the first element of a Section 1 claim to require \"some form \nof concerted action,\" defined as, \"a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding or a \nmeeting of the minds ora conscious commitment to a common scheme.\" In re Flat Glass, 385 F.3d \nat 357 (cleaned up). \nA plaintiff can prove the existence of concerted action through direct or circumstantial \nevidence. \"Direct evidence is explicit and requires no inferences to establish the proposition or \nconclusion being asserted.\" InterVest, Inc. v. Bloomberg, L.P., 340 F.3d 144, 159 (3d Cir. 2003) \n(cleaned up). \"While direct evidence, the proverbial 'smoking-gun,' is generally the most \ncompelling means by which a plaintiff can make out his or her claim,\" in recognition of the \ndifficulty antitrust plaintiffs often face in obtaining direct evidence, \"plaintiffs have been permitted \n25 to rely solely on circumstantial evidence ( and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn \ntherefrom) to prove a conspiracy.\" Rossi, 156 F.3d at 465. \nWhile the traditional summary judgment standard generally applies in antitrust actions, \nwhen a plaintiff relies solely on circumstantial evidence to prove concerted action, \"antitrust law \nlimits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a\u00a7 1 case.\" In re Flat Glass, \n385 F.3d at 357 (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 576, 588 \n(1986)). \"This higher threshold is imposed in antitrust cases to avoid deterring innocent conduct \nthat reflects enhanced, rather than restrained, competition.\" In re Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 357. \nTherefore, \"conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy \ndoes not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy.\" Inter Vest, 340 F .3d at 160 \n(quoting Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588)). Matsushita, however, \ndoes not mean that antitrust defendants are entitled to summary judgment merely \nby showing that there is a plausible explanation for their conduct; rather the focus \nmust remain on the evidence proffered by the plaintiff and whether that evidence \ntends to exclude the possibility that the defendants were acting independently. \nRossi, 156 F.3d at 467 (cleaned up). \n\"Thus, where the nonmoving party has put forth evidence that provides an inference of \nconcerted action, the moving party bears the burden of proving that drawing the inference of \nunlawful behavior is unreasonable.\" Id ( cleaned up). \"While ambiguous conduct cannot create a \ntriable issue of fact, when the alleged conduct is facially anticompetitive and exactly the harm the \nantitrust laws aim to prevent, no special care need be taken in assigning inferences to circumstantial \nevidence.\" Id (cleaned up). \nThe Third Circuit has explained, \"the acceptable inferences which can be drawn from \ncircumstantial evidence vary with the plausibility of the plaintiffs' theory and the dangers \nassociated with such inferences.\" Petruzzi 's /GA Supermarkets, Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co., 998 \n26 F.2d 1224, 1232 (3d Cir. 1993). That is, in a situation where (1) a plaintiffs \"theory of conspiracy \nis not implausible,\" but rather makes \"perfect economic sense,\" and (2) \"the challenged activities \n[ cannot] reasonably be perceived as procompetitive,\" \"more liberal inferences from the evidence \nshould be permitted than in Matsushita because the attendant dangers from drawing inferences \nrecognized in Matsushita are not present.\" In re Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 358 (cleaned up). \nNevertheless, \"the mere facts that a plaintiff alleges a plausible conspiracy and that that \nallegation does not threaten to chill procompetitive behavior do not mean that there are no \nrestrictions on the inferences that can be drawn from the evidence it puts forward.\" Petruzzi 's, 998 \nF.2d at 1232. \"[A] plaintiff cannot withstand a summary judgment motion by establishing only \nconsciously parallel behavior on the part of the defendants.\" Id. \"Instead, in a conscious parallelism \ncase, a plaintiff also must demonstrate the existence of certain 'plus' factors, for only when these \nadditional factors are present does the evidence tend to exclude the possibility that the defendants \nacted independently.\" Id. These \"plus factors\" can include: (1) \"evidence implying a traditional \nconspiracy,\" e.g., evidence \"relating to the defendants' opportunity to conspire and the solicitation \nof others to partake in common action,\" (2) evidence that \"defendants had a motive to conspire,\" \nand (3) evidence that defendants \"acted contrary to their self-interest.\" Id. at 1244 & n.17. \n\"[ A ]t the summary judgment stage, a court is not to weigh the evidence or make credibility \ndeterminations.\" Petruzzi 's, 998 F.2d at 1230. \"[A] court should not tightly compartmentalize the \nevidence put forward by the nonmovant, but instead should analyze it as a whole to see if together \nit supports an inference of concerted action.\" Id. \nICP argues that Defendants conspired to remove ICP as a competitor in the market for \nselling new heavy construction equipment. ICP claims this conspiracy unfolded in two stages. \nFirst, upon learning that IronPlanet had contracted with ICP to sell Chinese-manufactured new \n27 heavy construction equipment on its website, Defendants conspired to pressure lronPlanet to \nterminate its arrangement with ICP. Second, IronPlanet joined the conspiracy when, in response \nto the coordinated pressure, it terminated its agreement with ICP and removed the new equipment \nfrom its site. \nTo survive Defendants' motions for summary judgment, ICP must present direct or \ncircumstantial evidence that tends to \"exclude the possibility\" that Defendants acted \nindependently. This means that for each defendant, ICP must present evidence showing (1) that \nthe defendant pressured IronPlanet to terminatdts agreement with ICP, and (2) that the application \nof that pressure was part of a conscious agreement with at least one other actor to restrain trade, \nand/or that the pressure resulted in a conscious agreement with at least one other actor to restrain \ntrade. \na. Komatsu \nICP cites the following evidence to support its claim that Komatsu pressured IronPlanet to \nterminate its relationship with ICP: \n\u2022 At 3 :20 pm on March 26, 2014, Komatsu' s Tim Tripas spoke on the phone with \nIronPlanet's Greg Owens for 26 minutes. (D.I. 429-28 at -59). \n\u2022 At 10:25 pm on March 26, 2014, Kent Van Zanten, a member ofKomatsu's Remarketing \nteam, sent an email to other Komatsu employees with a link to IronPlanet's website and \nthe subject, \"one way to sell products in North America ... \" (D.I. 429-27). Tim Tripas was \nnot copied on this email. \n. \u2022 The next day, on March 27, 2014, Komatsu's Van Zanten emailed Komatsu's Director of \nRemarketing, Lee Haak, a link to LonKing equipment posted on IronPlanet' s website, with \nthe subject, \"SEE IF THIS COMES THROUGH.\" (D.I. 429-32). Tripas was not copied on \n28 this email either, although Tripas testified he \"was in constant communication\" with Haak \nin 2014. (D.I. 429-52 at 41:19-20). \n\u2022 On March 31, 2014, Tripas called Owens; the call lasted less than one minute. (D.I. 429-\n28 at -60). \n\u2022 ICP's Tim Frank testified in his deposition that on April 4, 2014, IronPlanet's Jeff Jeter \n\"called and said that we have a problem, that Cat and at least one other manufacturer had \ncalled earlier in the day and were putting pressure on he and Greg to terminate their contract \nwith us or they would stop doing business with them on the equipment side.\" (D.I. 429-57 \nat 50: 11-22). \n\u2022 Frank also testified in his deposition that on April 16, 2014, IronPlanet's Jeff Jeter called \nhim again regarding lronPlanet's termination of ICP and IronPlanet's Hosted Store \nAgreement. Frank testified that Jeter \"apologized, said that this was wrong, that the \npressure that they were under was very strong,\" and that, in response to Frank asking \"who \nbesides Caterpillar was putting the pressure on them,\" Jeter responded, \"You know who \nour investors are.\" (Id at 78:17-25). \n\u2022 In April 2014, the only heavy construction equipment manufacturer investors in IronPlanet \nwere Caterpillar (9.45%), Komatsu (7.27%), and Volvo (3.63%). (D.1. 429-44). \n\u2022 On April 16, 2014, Komatsu's Tripas called IronPlanet's Owens and their phones were \nconnected for less than a minute. (D.I. 429-28 at -64). \n\u2022 On the morning of April 17, 2014, Owens and Tripas spoke on the phone for approximately \nsixteen minutes. (Id). \nThis evidentiary record is insufficient to reasonably support an inference that anyone from \nKomatsu pressured lronPlanet to terminate its relationship with ICP. There is no evidence \n29 regarding the substance ofTripas's phone conversations with Owens. There is no direct evidence \nI \nthat anyone from Komatsu other than Tripas had any communication with anyone from IronPlanet \nduring the relevant time period. There is no evidence that Tri pas was even aware of IronPlanet' s \nagreement with ICP at the time of those conversations.4 Moreover, Tripas testified that in 2014, \nhe normally communicated with IronPlanet's Greg Owens \"one to five times a month,\" due to his \nrole as an observer for the IronPlanet board from 2007 to 2015. (D.I. 397-21 at 14:13-15:16, 48:9-\n49:7). \n\"Conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, \nstanding alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy.\" Inter Vest, Inc. v. Bloomberg, L.P., \n340 F.3d 144, 149 (3d Cir. 2003) (cleaned up). Here, in light of the uncontroverted evidence \nregarding the nature of the business relationship between Tripas and IronPlanet, the phone calls \nbetween Tripas and Owens are insufficient on their own to support any inference that Komatsu \npressured IronPlanet. \nThe only other evidence ICP cites to support the inference that Komatsu pressured \nIronPlanet is Tim Frank's testimony that IronPlanet' s Jeter told him over the phone that IronPlanet \nhad been pressured by both Caterpillar and another manufacturer/investor in IronPlanet. Even \nassuming these statements would be admissible against Komatsu, 5 they are far too ambiguous to \n4 Tripas testified that he had not heard of ICP until Komatsu was \"notified about a potential \nlawsuit,\" from ICP, well after the relevant 2014 time period. (D.I. 397-21 at 38:17-39:8). \n5 Because there is no evidence outside of Jeter's statements showing an agreement existed \nbetween Komatsu and IronPlanet, the coconspirator exclusion from hearsay, Fed. R. Evid. \n801(d)(2)(E), would not apply to Jeter's statements in ICP's case against Komatsu. United States \nv. Ammar, 714 F.2d 238, 245 (3d Cir. 1983) (for a coconspirator statement to be admitted under \nRule 802( d)(2)(E) \"there must be independent evidence establishing the existence of the \nconspiracy and connecting the declarant and defendant to it\"). After Ammar, the Rule was amended \nin 1997: \"The statement must be considered but does not by itself establish ... the existence of the \nconspiracy or participation in it.\" In other words, if there is not some other evidence that Komatsu \n30 create a triable issue of fact in ICP's case against Komatsu. Rossi, 156 F.3d at 467. Indeed, Frank \nhimself assumed the \"other\" manufacturer/investor to whom Jeter was referring was Volvo, not \nKomatsu. (D.I. 397-25 at -4527 (Tim Frank writing in a July 4, 2014 email, \"We launched at \nConExpo successfully, and 2 weeks later, Cat and Volvo forced Iron Planet to terminate their \ncontract with us.\")). \nBecause no factfinder could reasonably infer from the evidence in the record that Komatsu \npressured IronPlanet to terminate its relationship with ICP,6 Komatsu's motion for summary \njudgment on ICP's antitrust claim is GRANTED. \nb. Caterpillar \nThere is, on the other hand, sufficient evidence from which a factfinder could infer that \nCaterpillar conspired with at least Thompson, Ring Power, and IronPlanet to remove' ICP as a \ncompetitor in the new heavy construction equipment market. ICP has cited a combination of direct \nand circumstantial evidence showing (1) that Caterpillar, Thompson, Ring Power, and IronPlanet \neach took parallel actions in furtherance of the goal of removing ICP as a competitor, and (2) that \nthe evidence tends to exclude the possibility that these actions were taken independently. \ni. Conscious Parallelism \nTo demonstrate conscious parallelism, ICP need not show that Caterpillar, Ring Power, \nThompson, and IronPlanet took identical actions. In re Generic Pharms. Pricing Antitrust Litig., \n338 F. Supp. 3d 404,442 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (\"the Third Circuit has found that a showing of parallel \npricing requires only evidence that defendants 'acted similarly,' and not evidence that they charged \nwas a conspirator, it does not matter what Jeter said. I need not decide here whether the other \nhearsay exceptions ICP raises apply. (See D.I. 416 at 11-12). \n6 There is also no evidentiary record to support any communications between anyone at \nKomatsu and Caterpillar or its dealers. \n31 the s~e prices or engaged in identical conduct.\") ( quoting Petruzzi 's, 998 F.2d at 1243). Rather, \nconscious parallelism can be established by showing that all alleged co-conspirators took actions \n\"around the same time in response to similar market conditions,\" i.e., here, in response to ICP's \nentrance as a price-cutting competitor in the market for new heavy equipment. In re Generic \nPharms., 338 F. Supp. 3d at 441 n.209 (quoting In re Musical Instruments & Equip. Antitrust \nLitig., 798 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir. 2015)). \nTherefore, evidence (1) that Caterpillar, Ring Power, and Thompson each pressured \nIronPlanet to terminate its relationship with ICP around the same time, and (2) that IronPlanet did \nterminate its relationship with ICP around that same time, is sufficient to make a showing of \nconscious parallelism by Caterpillar, Ring Power, Thompson, and IronPlanet. \nFor the following reasons, I find that ICP has met its burden of establishing consciously \nparallel action by Caterpillar, Ring Power, Thompson, and IronPlanet. \nCaterpillar \nThere is both direct and circumstantial evidence showing that Caterpillar pressured \nIronPlanet to terminate its relationship with ICP. \nFirst, there is evidence showing that Caterpillar, using its position as a controlling \nsh~eholder in Cat Auction with veto rights over any potential change in ownership, predicated the \ncontinuation of merger negotiations between Cat Auction and IronPlanet on IronPlanet terminating \nits relationship with ICP. Upon learning about IronPlanet and ICP's arrangement, Kent Adams, \nmanaging direct of the bank representing Cat Auction in its merger negotiations, wrote in a draft \nletter to IronPlanet' s Greg Owens, \"Without a more full understanding, I have a strong suspicion \nthat [Iron Planet's new relationship with ICP] would kill any hope of a transaction between Iron \nPlanet and Cat Auction Services.from Caterpillar's perspective.\" (D.I. 419-28 at -89 (emphasis \n32 added)). Caterpillar executive Richard Longbottom referred to the deal internally as \"a show \nstopper,\" and Caterpillar executive Steve Gosselin agreed, but also expressly noted, \"I agree with \ndead deal, but what if we could ensure he cancels this arrangement and we govern and manage all \nfuture OEM arrangements ... \" (D.1. 419-50 at-34-36). \nBill Hoeft, chairman of the Cat Auction board, alluded to Caterpillar's intention to \ncondition the Cat Auction/IronPlanet merger on the termination of IronPlanet' s relationship with \nICP when he informed Owens in an email, \"We would like to better understand [IronPlanet's new \nrelationship with ICP], as we are concerned that Caterpillar and the CAT dealers would have \nsignificant concerns about any arrangement where Iron Planet is providing auction services for \nnew equipment for a Caterpillar competitor.\" (D.1. 399-24 at -83). Moreover, Caterpillar's Pablo \nKoziner's statement in an internal email to Caterpillar's Richard Longbottom, \"Greg [Owens] says \nifwe can come to some for[m] of agreement, then the ICP initiative would go away,\" demonstrates \nboth (1) that Owens understood Caterpillar's quid pro quo position regarding the IronPlanet/Cat \nAuction merger and IronPlanet' s relationship with ICP, and (2) that Caterpillar and IronPlanet \ndiscussed the ICP issue outside of the documented email/written correspondence between them \nthat is in the record. \nSecond, there is direct evidence showing that lronPlanet's Jeff Jeter told Tim Frank in a \ncontemporaneous phone conversation that IronPlanet was terminating its relationship with ICP in \nresponse to pressure from Caterpillar and others. \nIn his deposition, Frank testified7 that when Jeter first called to inform him IronPlanet \nintended to terminate its partnership with ICP, Jeter expressly told him, \"Cat and at least one other \n7 Caterpillar argues Frank's testimony regarding what Jeter told him over the phone is \ninadmissible hearsay. I disagree. Under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), Frank's testimony would not \nqualify as hearsay, because IronPlanet became a coconspirator (within the meaning of the Rule) \n33 manufacturer had called earlier in the day and were putting pressure on he and Greg to terminate \ntheir contract with us or they would stop doing business with them on the equipment side.\" (D.I. \n419-23 at 50:16-22). Jeter's contemporaneous notes regarding that same conversation corroborate \nFrank's testimony: \"Talked w Tim this am: ... understands pressure and said he suspects will be \nhard to brush off if they are serious.\" (D.I. 419-68). \nThat evening, Frank followed up with Jeter about their phone conversation, saying, \"if Cat \nis going to make you pull the plug on us, I would like to know as soon as possible to make other \narrangements.\" (D.I. 419-69). When Jeter forwarded this email from Frank to lronPlanet's Greg \nOwens and Doug Feick, he did not refute (or even acknowledge) Frank's statement about \nCaterpillar, instead simply stating, \"So, I assume I need to tell him definitively he needs to start \nmaking alternative plans and we will discuss how to support him in a transition. Thoughts / other \npositioning?\" (Id). \nA few weeks later, Frank testified that Jeter called him again to discuss the termination of \nIronPlanet and ICP's relationship, at which time Jeter \"apologized, said that this was wrong, that \nthe pressure that they were under was very strong.\" (D.I. 419-23 at 78:17-25). Frank testified that \nhe asked Jeter, \"who besides Caterpillar was putting the pressure on them,\" and that, rather than \nrefute that Caterpillar had been responsible for pressuring IronPlanet, Jeter responded, \"you know \nwho our investors are,\" and then, upon being asked again, repeated, \"you know who our investors \nare.\" (Id). \nCaterpillar argues that, as a Cat Auction shareholder, with a \"strike right,\" it had the right \nto unilaterally veto Cat Auction's merger with IronPlanet, and therefore any pressure it put on \nwith Caterpillar at the time it removed ICP's hosted store from its website. The record shows this \nhappened the day before Frank and Jeter's phone conversation. (D.I. 419-65). \n34 IronPlanet to that effect cannot be considered the basis of an antitrust violation. The law is clear, \nhowever, that perfectly legal actions can form the basis of an unlawful antitrust conspiracy claim \nwhere, as here, there is evidence showing that the defendant took those lawful actions \"to \neffectuate the conspiracy which the statute forbids.\" American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 \nU.S. 781,809 (1946). \"It is not of importance whether the mean~ used to accomplish the unlawful \nobjective are in themselves lawful or unlawful. Acts done to give effect to the conspiracy may be \nin themselves wholly innocent acts.\" Id \nRing Power and Thompson \nThere is evidence sufficient to support an inference that Ring Power and Thompson \npressured IronPlanet to terminate its relationship with ICP. \nOn Tuesday, April 1, Ring Power's Frank Fowler sent an email to other Ring Power \nexecutives about IronPlanet \"offering new Chinese equipment for sale on their web site,\" \ncommenting on the news, \"If so, not good.\" (D.I. 419-61). Fowler wrote that he \"spoke to Jerome \n[Guilford] last night and he indicated Cat is not happy with what they have seen and heard as well,\" \nand that Guilford had told him Ritchie Bros. had reached out to Caterpillar \"trying to set up a \nmeeting with Cat to discuss how they could possibly work together.\" (Id). Fowler then stated he \nintended to call IronPlanet' s Greg Owens the next day \"to verify and find out what is going on.\" \n(Id.). \nThe next day, April 2, Fowler contacted or spoke with the following people on the phone, \nin chronological order, over the course of a single day: (1) Thompson's used equipment buyer, \nBilly Seals, (2) IronPlanet's Greg Owens, (3) Caterpillar's Richard Longbottom, (4) Thompson's \nused equipment manager, Richard Lindley, (5) Caterpillar's Longbottom, (6) IronPlanet's Owens. \n35 The very next day, April 3, IronPlanet suddenly, and without informing ICP, removed all \ntraces of ICP from its website. IronPlanet's head of development, Jeff Barca-Hall, informed \nIronPlanet's Jeter, Owens, and Feick in an email: \nThe ICP items are no longer visible on our site. The ICP Store and its homepage \nbanner are gone. All ICP items have been removed from users' Watch Lists. \nWe are still hooked-up to process purchases from ICPDirect, but we've done \neverything we can to hide that fact. ICP buyers can only make a purchase from \nICPDirect.com and they now go directly to our \"Confirm Purchase\" page when \nthey press ICP's \"Buy Now'' button, never seeing an IronPlanet item page. (The \nfirst thing you see is an IronPlanet login prompt, which certainly reveals that we \nare still processing their sales, but can't be helped). The same thing will happen if \nsomeone with an old bookmark tries to view one of those item pages. We have also \nsubmitted a request to Google and Bing to forget they ever found any ICP-related \npages on our site (but we may still show up in their searches for about 24-48 hours). \nNote that our logo and our name (\" ... IronPlanet, our partner site ... \") are still \npresent on the product pages of ICPDirect.com. \n-JBH \n(D.I. 419-65). \nThe following week, a sales representative from Thompson expressly informed a sales \nrepresentative from IronPlanet that it could not move forward with ongoing negotiations over an \nequipment sale until it had received written confirmation from IronPlanet' s Vice President of \nSales, Jeff Jeter, on formal IronPlanet letterhead, that IronPlanet had terminated its relationship \nwith ICP. (D.I. 419-70). \nFinally, on June 3, 2014, a few months after IronPlanet removed ICP from its website, \nKenny Bishop, the same Thompson executive who gave the final approval for Thompson to \nI \nresume business with IronPlanet upon receiving proof of termination of IronPlanet' s relationship \nwith ICP, alluded to the role Caterpillar dealers had played in pressuring IronPlanet in an email to \nCaterpillar's Stephan Downing. Bishop sent Downing a link to ICP's website, noting, \"This Is the \n36 company that showed up on Iron Planet's website. After much uproar from Cat dealers they took \nit off.\" (D.I. 419-89). \nA factfinder could reasonably infer from this combination of evidence that both Ring \nPower and Thompson pressured IronPlanet to terminate its agreement with ICP. \nIronPlanet \nFinally, it is undisputed that IronPlanet abruptly terminated its Hosted Store Agreement \nwith ICP prior to the expiration ofits term, without invoking the \"for cause termination\" provision \nof the Agreement. \nii. Plus Factors \nA showing that Caterpillar, Ring Power, Thompson, and IronPlanet engaged in consciously \nparallel behavior is insufficient to establish concerted action. \"Instead, in a conscious parallelism \ncase, a plaintiff also must demonstrate the existence of certain 'plus' factors, for only when these \nadditional factors are present does the evidence tend to exclude the possibility that the defendants \nacted independently.\" Petruzzi 's, 998 F.2d at 1232. Courts traditionally cite three plus factors as \npertinent to the independent action inquiry: (1) \"evidence implying a traditional conspiracy,\" e.g., \nevidence relating to the coconspirators' \"opportunity to conspire and the solicitation of others to \npartake in common action\"; (2) evidence that the coconspirators had a motive to conspire; and (3) \nevidence that the coconspirators acted contrary to their individual self-interest. Id. at 1244 & n.17. \nFor the following reasons, I find that ICP has met its burden of showing that multiple plus \nfactors are satisfied with respect to each coconspirator and, therefore, the evidence tends to exclude \nthe possibility (1) that Caterpillar, Ring Planet, and Thompson acted independently in pressuring \nIronPlanet, and (2) that IronPlanet acted independently in terminating its relationship with ICP. \nTraditional Conspiracy \n37 There is evidence showing that Caterpillar, Ring Power, Thompson, and IronPlanet had an. \nopportunity to conspire. The record shows that, one day after raising concerns internally to other \nRing Power executives about IronPlanet and ICP's arrangement, Frank Fowler, Ring Power's \nSenior Vice President, contacted or spoke on the phone with the following people over the course \nof a single day: Thompson's used equipment buyer, Billy Seals; IronPlanet's Greg Owens; \nCaterpillar's Richard Longbottom; Thompson's used equipment manager, Richard Lindley; \nCaterpillar's Richard Longbottom, again; IronPlanet's Greg Owens, again; and finally, Greg \nOwens, a final time, immediately following Greg Owens's phone conversation with lronPlanet's \nPresident of Sales, Jeff Jeter, and General Counsel, Doug Feick. \nStanding alone, this series of phone calls is evidence that the conspirators had an \nopportunity to conspire. The probative value of the calls as circumstantial evidence of an \nagreement -or rather, two successive agreements -only increases when considered in context. \nThe fact that IronPlanet abruptly removed ICP from its website the very next day reinforces the \ninference that the purpose of the phone calls among Ring Power, Thompson, and Caterpillar was \nto coordinate a pressure campaign against IronPlanet. \nThe timing of the phone calls relative to IronPlanet's decision also strongly supports an \ninference that IronPlanet capitulated to that pressure and agreed to terminate its relationship with \nICP, thereby joining the conspiracy to remove ICP as a seller of new heavy construction \nequipment. Indeed, there is extensive evidence not only supporting the inference that IronPlanet' s \ndecision to terminate its agreement with ICP was the direct result of pressure from Caterpillar and \nits dealers, but also that the explanation IronPlanet gave later for its decision was pretextual. See \nBig Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding \ninference of concerted action sufficient to survive summary judgment on Sherman Act \u00a7 I \n38 concerted refusal to deal claim was supported by evidence showing BMW NA's decision not to \ngrant plaintiff a dealership :franchise was the result of complaints from BMW dealers and BMW \nNA's explanations for the denial were pretextual). \nIn addition to Tim Frank's testimony that IronPlanet's Jeff Jeter told him on two separate \noccasions that IronPlanet's decision to terminate its relationship with ICP was made in response \nto \"pressure\" from Caterpillar and others, there is also substantial circumstantial evidence \ncorroborating that testimony. The abruptness and timing of IronPlanet' s decision coming one day \nafter a flurry of phone calls among the coconspirators, the lack of evidence of any forewarning to \nICP, the fact that IronPlanet did not inform ICP of its decision until after it had already removed \nICP's store from its site, and the remarkably rushed, comprehensive measures IronPlanet took to _ \nensure all traces ofICP had been removed from IronPlanet's website all support an inference that \nIronPlanet terminated its agreement with ICP as a direct result of pressure from Caterpillar and the \ndealers. \nIronPlanet claims that its decision to terminate its agreement with ICP after just one month, \ndespite the Agreement's one-year term, was due to ICP' s disappointing sales. There is not, \nhowever, any contemporaneous evidence in the record indicating that was IronPlanet's position at \nthe time of the termination. There is no record of anyone from IronPlanet communicating any \nconcerns about disappointing sales either internally or to ICP in March or April 2014. A factfmder \ncould reasonably conclude from this lack of contemporaneous evidence supporting IronPlanet' s \npoor sales explanation, combined with the abundance of contemporaneous evidence showing the \ndecision was made in response to pressure, that IronPlanet' s poor sales explanation is pretextual, \nand not even very plausible pretext. \nFor these reasons, I fmd that the \"traditional elements of conspiracy\" plus factor is satisfied. \n39 Motive to Conspire \nThere is evidence showing that Caterpillar, the dealers, and IronPlanet each had a motive \nto conspire. \nAs an initial matter, the record shows that Caterpillar knew, through its internal competitive \nanalysis, that ICP's Chinese-manufactured new heavy construction equipment would be offered at \nprices that were up to 45% lower than Caterpillar's new heavy construction equipment sold \nthrough its dealers. (D.I. 419-48 at -25). Therefore, there is evidence to support a finding that \nCaterpillar and its dealers had a significant economic motive to eliminate ICP's price-cutting \ncompetition. \nIn addition, as Caterpillar insists and ICP's expert concedes, Caterpillar did not have \nsufficient leverage based solely on its used equipment sales to IronPlanet to be able to unilaterally \naffect IronPlanet's behavior. (D.I. 391 at 7-8). Nor did Ring Power or Thompson, based solely on \ntheir individual used equipment sales to IronPlanet. (D.I. 399-2 Ex. 19 at 12, 15-16 (Ring Power \nrepresented less than 1 % oflronPlanet's revenue in 2013); D.I. 399-1 Ex. 3 at 99:20-22 (Thompson \n\u00b7 was a \"small seller\" for IronPlanet)). \nCaterpillar did, however, have considerable leverage over IronPlanet in the form of the Cat \nAuction/lronPlanet merger negotiations. Caterpillar had veto rights over any change in control of \nCat Auction, and there is evidence showing that both Caterpillar and IronPlanet understood that \nthe promise of Caterpillar dealers' cooperation and increased future business was a critical \ncomponent of that leverage. (See D.I. 419-28 at -89 (\"It would be good to know (and to see) the \nproposed Caterpillar letter being drafted to go out to Dealers in regards to more support for [Cat \nAuction]. This is a piece of leverage for us potentially\") (Caterpillar/Cat Auction internal email); \nD .I. 3 99-4 Ex. 31 at -103 (\"if Cat is backing this combined entity [IronPlanet/Cat Auction] with \n40 their volume and not sending to [Ritchie Bros.], the dealers in North America alone could produce \nthis incremental volume\") (IronPlanet email to Cat Auction board members)). \nTherefore, the dealers had a motive to conspire with Caterpillar, as they did not have \nleverage over IronPlanet on their own but could agree to reinforce Caterpillar's merger-related \nleverage. Caterpillar, likewise, had a motive to conspire with its dealers in order to increase its \nleverage over IronPlanet. Finally, with Caterpillar and the dealers working together, IronPlanet \nhad a strong motive to acquiesce to their combined pressure and to agree to renege on its agreement \nto an on-line sales platform for ICP. From IronPlanet's perspective, a successful merger between \nIronPlanet and Cat Auction could \"provide exclusivity to [IronPlanet] for the CAT product that \nwas going to auction.\" (D.I. 419-25; See D.I. 399-4 Ex. 31 at -103). \nFor these reasons, I find that the \"motive to conspire\" plus factor is satisfied with respect \nto: all coconspirators. \nActions Contrary to Self-Interest \nThere is evidence showing that at least Caterpillar, Thompson, and IronPlanet acted \ncontrary to self-interest. \nFirst, the record shows that Caterpillar was financially invested in overseeing a successful \nmerger between Cat Auction and IronPlanet because Cat Auction, which had been operating at a \nloss for years, was a financial liability for Caterpillar, its largest shareholder. (D.I. 399-1 Ex. 5 at \n-672; D.I. 419-3 at 131:15-133-23). Therefore, threatening to abandon merger negotiations with \nIronPlanet was an action contrary to Caterpillar's pecuniary self-interest. \nSecond, there is evidence showing that Thompson acted against its economic self-interest \nby pausing an already in-progress business deal with IronPlanet until it had received written \nassurances oflronPlanet's termination of its agreement with ICP. \n41 Finally, IronPlanet acted against its self-interest by breaching its Hosted Store Agreement \nwith I CP without providing any legal justification, knowingly exposing itself to litigation risk from \nICP for breach of contract. \n2. Unreasonable Restraint \nTo determine whether a restraint on trade is \"unreasonable,\" courts apply one of two \nstandards, depending on the nature of the conduct at issue. Under the default \"rule of reason\" \nstandard, the court must weigh \"all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive \npractice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.\" Rossi, 156 \nF .3d at 461 ( cleaned up). \"Under the per se standard, conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive or \nwould always or almost always tend to restrict competition is conclusively presumed to \nlll11'easonably restrain competition without elaborate inquiry into the precise harm it has caused or \nthe business excuse for its use.\" Id (cleaned up). \nPer my February 24, 2017 Revised Discovery Plan and Scheduling Order, discovery in this \ncase is split into two phases. Phase 1 Discovery was limited to the conspiracy element of ICP's \nantitrust claim. (D.I. 95 at 2). Issues related to \"antitrust injury ... , market definition, and damages\" \nwere expressly excluded from the scope of Phase 1 Discovery. (Id). Defendants filed the instant \nmotions for summary judgment following the close of Phase 1, and prior to the beginning of Phase \n2. Because evidence that will be produced during Phase 2 is necessary for a complete analysis of \nthe \"unreasonable restraint\" element ofICP's antitrust claim, the parties have not briefed that issue \nin: connection with Defendants' motions for summary judgment. Thus, I will defer that analysis \nuntil after Phase 2 Discovery has been completed. \n42 For now, I find that ICP has met its burden of showing a genuine issue of material fact \nexists with respect to whether the conspiracy ICP has alleged placed an \"unreasonable restraint\" \non trade. \n3. Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, Caterpillar's motion for summary judgment on ICP's \nSherman Act Section 1 claim is DENIED. \nC. Tortious Interference Claim \nThe elements of a tortious interference claim8 are (1) the existence of a valid contract \nbetween the plaintiff and another; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the contract; (3) the \ndefendant's intentional and unjustified inducement of a breach of the contract; and ( 4) damages. \nHealy v.

Komatsu \nFor the reasons I explained above, supra III.B. l .a, there is no evidence from which a \nreasonable jury could conclude that Komatsu took any actions to induce IronPlanet to breach its \ncontract with ICP. Therefore, Komatsu's motion for summary judgment on ICP's claim oftortious \ninterference with contract is GRANTED. \n2. Caterpillar \n8 At the motion to dismiss stage, I analyzed ICP's tortious interference claim under Florida \nand Illinois law. (D.I. 292 at 3). In their summary judgment briefing, none of the parties have re\u00ad\nargued the choice of law issue, so I will continue to apply the laws of Florida and Illinois. ICP \nargued in its motion to dismiss briefing that its tortious interference claim should be governed by \nFlorida or Illinois law, as what is at the center ofICP' s tortious interference claim is \"a conspiracy \nin which substantial misconduct occurred in Florida [ where Ring Power and Thompson, \nCaterpillar's alleged coconspirators, reside] and Illinois [where Caterpillar resides].\" (D.I. 276 at \n6). \n43 There are two questions at the heart ofICP' s tortious interference claim against Caterpillar. \nThe first is the factual question of whether Caterpillar induced IronPlanet to breach its contract \nwith ICP by threatening to block a potential merger between Cat Auction and IronPlanet and \ncoordinating with its dealers to withhold used equipment sales from IronPlanet until IronPlanet \nterminated its relationship with ICP. For the reasons I have explained above, supra III.B.l.b, this \nquestion involves genuine issues of material fact. Therefore, it is for the jury, and not this Court, \nto.decide. \nThe second is the threshold legal question of whether such a factual showing would satisfy \nthe elements of a tortious interference with contract claim. Caterpillar argues it would not for two \nreasons: (1) Caterpillar, as a Cat Auction shareholder, was justified in using its \"protection \nprivilege\" to protect its investment in Cat Auction by ensuring Cat Auction did not deal with \nIrqnPlanet if IronPlanet was going to deal with ICP, and (2) Caterpillar could not have tortiously \ninterfered with IronPlanet and ICP's contract because, as a shareholder in IronPlanet, Caterpillar \nwas not a \"stranger\" to the contractual relationship. (D.I. 391 at 37-39). I consider each of these \narguments in turn. \nFirst, both Illinois and Florida law recognize \"a conditional privilege to interfere with \ncontracts where the defendant was acting to protect an interest which the law deems to be of equal \nor greater value than the plaintiffs contractual rights.\" Nation v. Am. Cap., Ltd., 682 F.3d 648, \n651 (7th Cir. 2012) (cleaned up); Ethyl Corp. v. Balter, 386 So. 2d 1220, 1224-25 (Fla. Dist. Ct. \nApp. 1980). \"This privilege covers the acts of corporate officers, directors, and shareholders \nundertaken on behalf of the corporation.\" Nation, 682 F.3d at 652. This broad statement generally \nrefers to the acts of such individuals in relation to contracts to which the corporation is a party. \nSee id. Nevertheless, the privilege also \"protects ... entities.\" (Id.); In Nation, the privilege \n44 conditionally applied as the corporate defendant was the majority shareholder trying to protect the \nvalue of the company in which it had invested. The privilege, however, is not without limitation. \nThe privilege does not apply if the defendant seeking to exercise the privilege (1) \"induced the \nbreach to further its personal goals or to injure the other party to the contract,\" and (2) \"acted \ncontrary to the best interest of the corporation.\" Id at 653 (cleaned up). \nHere, because Caterpillar is a minority shareholder in both Cat Auction and IronPlanet, it \nis unclear whether Caterpillar intends to invoke this privilege to justify threatening to block Cat \nAuction's merger with IronPlanet, or to justify inducing IronPlanet to terminate its contract with \nICP, or both. I assume a minority shareholder has as much interest in protecting its investment as \na majority shareholder. Regardless, there are genuine issues of material fact with respect to either \ntheory. In both situations, there is a dispute of material fact since ICP has presented evidence from \nwhich a jury could conclude that (1) Caterpillar's actions were taken to further its own interest of \nremoving ICP as a competitor to itself and its dealers, and (2) in the case of Cat Auction, halting \nmerger negotiations with IronPlanet was against Cat Auction's best interest, or, in the case of \nIronPlanet, breaching its contract with ICP was against IronPlanet's best interest. \nSecond, both Illinois and Florida law recognize that the defendant in a tortious interference \nwith contract case must be a third party, or a stranger, to the contractual relationship. Quist v. Bd \nof Tr. of Cmty. Coll. Dist. No. 525,258 Ill. App. 3d 814, 821 (1994) (Illinois); Palm Beach Cty. \nHealth Care Dist. v. Prof'/ Med Educ., Inc., 13 So. 3d 1090, 1094 (Fla. 4th DCA 2009). Caterpillar \nargues that, as a shareholder in IronPlanet, it could not have been a stranger to IronPlanet' s \ncontractual relationship with ICP. (D.I. 392 at 38-39 (citing Bridge Fin., Inc. v. J Fischer & \nAssocs., 310 So. 3d 45, 50 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2020) (holding defendant owning 5% interest in \ncontracting company was not a third party to that company's contractual relationship with plaintiff \n45 dtie to defendant's ownership interest in that company))). Both Illinois and Florida law, however, \nacknowledge that, like the protection privilege, the privilege to interfere is not absolute. \nUnder Illinois law, \"a party -which includes corporate officers -cannot interfere with its \nown contract unless the officer's conduct is malicious or without justification, namely that the \nconduct is unrelated or antagonistic to the corporation's interest.\" Mission Measurement Corp. v. \nBlackbaud, Inc., 287 F. Supp. 3d 691, 718 (N.D. Ill. 2017). Under Florida law, the \"privilege to \ninterfere\" enjoyed by a non-third party to a contractual relationship, e.g., an officer or employee, \nor here, a shareholder, of a contracting party \"is destroyed where an employee acts solely with \nulterior purposes, without an honest belief that his actions would benefit the employer, and the \nemployee's conduct concerning the contract or business relationship is not in the employer's best \ninterest.\" Salitv. Ruden, McClosky, Smith, Schuster & Russell, P.A., 742 So.2d 381,386 (Fla. Dist. \nCt. App. 1999). \nThere are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Caterpillar acted \"solely with \nulterior purposes,\" and not in IronPlanet's best interest, in inducing IronPlanet to breach its \ncontract with ICP. Therefore, Caterpillar's motion for summary judgment on ICP's tortious \ninterference claim is DENIED. \nstates: D. Dr. Leitzinger's Opinion (D.I. 396-1 Ex. 1-7) \nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 sets out the requirements for expert witness testimony and \nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, \nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert's \nscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to \nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based \non sufficient facts or data; ( c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and \nmethods; and ( d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the \nfacts of the case. \nFed. R. Evid. 702. \n46 The Third Circuit has explained: \nRule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony: qualification, \nreliability and fit. Qualification refers to the requirement that the witness possess \nspecialized expertise. We have interpreted this requirement liberally, holding that \n\"a broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert.\" Secondly, the \ntestimony must be reliable; it \"must be based on the 'methods and procedures of \nscience' rather than on 'subjective belief or unsupported speculation'; the expert \nmust have 'good grounds' for his o[r] her belief. In sum, Daubert holds that an \ninquiry into the reliability of scientific evidence under Rule 702 requires a \ndetermination as to its scientific validity.\" Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert \ntestimony must fit the issues in the case. In other words, the expert's testimony \nmust be relevant for the purposes of the case and must assist the trier of fact. The \nSupreme Court explained in Daubert that \"Rule 702's 'helpfulness' standard \nrequires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to \nadmissibility.\" \nBy means of a so-called \"Daubert hearing,\" the district court acts as a gatekeeper, \npreventing opinion testimony that does not meet the requirements of qualification, \nreliability and fit from reaching the jury. See Daubert (\"Faced with a proffer of \nexpert scientific testimony, then, the trial judge must determine at the outset, \npursuant to Rule 104( a) [ of the Federal Rules of Evidence] whether the expert is \nproposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact \nto understand or determine a fact in issue.\"). \nSchneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried, 320 F.3d 396, 404-05 (3d Cir. 2003) (cleaned \nup).9 \nCaterpillar moves to exclude the testimony ofICP's economic expert, Dr. Leitzinger. (D.I. \n392). Its scattershot argument in support of its motion boils down to three objections: Dr. \nLeitzinger (1) \"ignored the parties' used equipment data,\" (2) \"did not employ any peer-accepted \neconomics methodology\" in forming his opinions, and (3) relied on dismissed allegations and \nconsidered as coconspirators parties who are not defendants and were not specifically alleged by \nICP to be coconspirators. (D.I. 393 at 7-20). I am not persuaded by any of these arguments for the \nfollowing reasons. \n9 The Court wrote under an earlier version of Rule 702, but the subsequent amendments to \nit were not intended to make any substantive change. \n47 First, Dr. Leitzinger's failure to refer to used equipment sale numbers for each of the \ndefendants in his report does not render his opinions unreliable. Dr. Leitzinger's assignment was \nlimited in scope. He was asked to consider whether the evidence supported the existence of any \nplus factors supporting an inference of concerted action. (D.I. 396-1 Ex. 1 1 8). Dr. Leitzinger \nconsidered the evidence as a whole and offered an opinion, based on facts in the record related to \nthe market structure and unique dynamics of the U.S. heavy construction equipment industry, and \ncommunications among the coconspirators, that the evidence supported the existence of four plus \nfactors. If Caterpillar believes that Dr. Leitzinger did not sufficiently account for contradictory \nevidence in the record, that goes to the weight and not the admissibility of his opinions. \nCaterpillar's concerns can easily be addressed through cross-examination. \nSecond, Caterpillar's argument that Dr. Leitzinger does not employ \"skill or knowledge \ngreater than the average layman\" because he did not perform any \"data analysis\" is baseless. (D.I. \n393 at 8). Throughout his report, Dr. Leitzinger employs his expertise in industrial organization \nby using economic principles and literature to buttress his opinions. (See, e.g., D.I. 396-1 Ex. 1 at \n17 n.1 (surveying economic literature describing types of economic evidence, i.e., plus factors, \nthat \"affect the inferences one can draw about the existence of an alleged antitrust conspiracy\"), 1 \n35 (discussing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for measuring market concentration in antitrust \nanalysis and DOJ guidelines defining various levels of market concentration)). \nCourts have consistently found similar economic analyses of characteristics that make \nmarkets especially conducive to collusion to be a legitimate application of an expert witness's \nexpertise. In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 81 F. Supp. 3d 412, 422 (E.D. Pa. 2015) \n(rejecting Daubert challenge and noting, \"The field of economics contains a field of study on the \nfeatures of markets that make them particularly conducive to collusion, and [the expert witness] \n48 appears to be drawing from that field in his report.\"); In re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust Litig., 2013 \nWL 1855980, at *4 (D. Md. May 1, 2013) (\"Courts regularly admit expert testimony regarding \nwijether conduct is indicative of collusion\") ( cleaned up). If Dr. Leitzinger attempts to offer \ntestimony at trial that veers into the territory of lay opinion testimony not grounded in his \nspecialized expertise, that can be addressed at trial. Based on what is contained in his report, \nhowever, Caterpillar's concerns do not warrant wholesale exclusion of Dr. Leitzinger's opinions. \nFinally, as I explained at oral argument, the fact that I dismissed and struck ICP's unlawful \nmerger allegations does not mean evidence relating to the negotiations leading up to that merger \nbetween IronPlanet and Cat Auction is irrelevant to ICP's Sherman Act\u00a7 1 concerted refusal to \ndeal claim. Moreover, there is no requirement that ICP join each coconspirator as a defendant, nor \nthat ICP specifically name each coconspirator as a coconspirator in its complaint. Therefore, it is \nnot improper for Dr. Leitzinger to consider evidence related to the merger negotiations or to treat \nIronPlanet and Cat Auction as coconspirators in his analysis. \nFor these reasons, Caterpillar's motion to exclude Dr. Leitzinger's testimony and report is \nDENIED . \n. IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Komatsu's motion for summary judgment (D.I. 394) is \nGRANTED. Caterpillar's motions for summary judgment (D.I. 390) and to exclude the testimony \nof Dr. Leitzinger (D.I. 392) are DENIED. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n49 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nINTERNATIONAL CONSTRUCTION \nPRODUCTS, LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCATERPILLAR INC. and KOMATSU \nAMERICA CORP., \nDefendants.
