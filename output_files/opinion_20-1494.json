TAYLOR, \nPetitioner, \nV. \nSTATE OF DELAWARE, and ATTORNEY \nGENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, \nRespondents. \nMEMORANDUM \nI. BACKGROUND Civ. A. No. 20-1494-CFC \nIn December 2007, a Delaware Superior Court jury found Petitioner guilty of six \ncounts of first degree rape, one count of continuous sexual abuse of a child, and one \ncount of endangering the welfare of a child. The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to \n115 years of Level V incarceration, the minimum mandatory term of incarceration for his \nconvictions. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's convictions and \nsentence on direct appeal. See Taylor v. State, 982 A.2d 279 (Del. 2008). \nIn June 2009, Petitioner filed a motion for a new trial alleging the victim had \nrecanted her trial testimony. The Superior Court held an evidentiary hearing on the \nmatter and subsequently denied the motion. Petitioner did not appeal. In December \n2009, Petitioner filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior \nCourt Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\"). The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 \nmotion, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on appeal. See Taylor \nv. State, 2011 WL 721517 (Del. Mar. 1, 2011 ). In July 2012, Petitioner filed in this Court a habeas petition asserting eight \ngrounds for relief: 1) the victim's trial testimony contained inconsistencies; 2) there was \ninsufficient evidence to support his convictions; 3) there was a discovery violation when \nthe State disclosed a second diary maintained by the victim on the day trial began; 4) a \nletter the victim sent to him after the trial constituted new evidence supporting his actual \ninnocence, not simply impeachment evidence; 5) his right to a fair and speedy trial was \nviolated because eight months elapsed between his arrest and his trial; 6) his Miranda \nrights were violated because the police officer did not read the Miranda warning upon \narrest; 7) his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated when his trial counsel \ndid not raise a Miranda violation claim; and 8) his right to effective assistance of counsel \nwas violated when his trial counsel: a) failed to raise lack of sufficiency of the evidence; \nb) failed to introduce as evidence Petitioner's own diary; c) failed to prepare for trial \n\"when [Petitioner] was not allowed to go to work or church;\" and d) kept changing the \nquestions he was going to ask Petitioner at trial. (See D.I. 1 in Taylor v. Johnson, Civ. \nA. No. 12-1010-GMS) On August 25, 2015, the Honorable Gregory M. Sleet dismissed \nthe petition as time-barred. (See D.I. 21; D.I. 22 in Taylor v. Johnson, Civ. A. No. 12-\n1010-GMS) \nOn June 20, 2019, Taylor filed a second Rule 61 motion in the Superior Court, \nasserting several claims based on \"new evidence.\" The Superior Court denied the \nmotion, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision in October or \nNovember 2019. (D.I. 3 at 6, 8) \n2 Presently pending before the Court is Petitioner's new petition for writ of habeas \ncorpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\"Petition\"). (D.I. 3) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA district court may summarily dismiss a petition for a writ of habeas corpus \nwithout ordering a responsive pleading \"if it plainly appears from the face of the petition \nand any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 \nU.S.C. foll.\u00a7 2254; see also Mayle v. Felix, 545 U.S. 644,656 (2005). Federal habeas \nrelief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is only available to a petitioner who demonstrates that his \ncustody under a state court judgment violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the \nUnited States. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); see also Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-\n68 (1991). \nIn turn, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), a petitioner must seek \nauthorization from the appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive \nhabeas petition in a district court. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U.S. 147, 152 (2007); \nRule 9, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a72254. A habeas petition is classified as second or successive \nwithin the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 if a prior petition has been decided on the \nmerits, the prior and new petitions challenge the same conviction, and the new petition \nasserts a claim that was, or could have been, raised in a prior habeas petition. See \nBenchoff v. Colleran, 404 F.3d 812, 817 (3d Cir. 2005); In re Olabode, 325 F.3d 166, \n169-73 (3d Cir. 2003). If a habeas petitioner erroneously files a second or successive \nhabeas petition \"in a district court without the permission of a court of appeals, the \n3 district court's only option is to dismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals \npursuantto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.\" Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir. 2002). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nThe instant Petition asserts ten overlapping grounds for relief based on \"new \nevidence\" of Petitioner's actual innocence. (D.1. 3 at 3-23) The ten grounds can be \ndistilled to following five \"new evidence\" arguments: (1) Petitioner's convictions for six \ncounts of rape were inconsistent with the victim's trial testimony; (2) a juror was \nprejudiced against him due to the trial judge's admonishment of the juror's employer; (3) \ntrial counsel should have questioned the victim about the identifying marks on \nPetitioner's body; (4) a journal that was admitted into evidence showed evidence of a \nconspiracy between the victim and Petitioner's ex-wife to frame Petitioner for rape; and \n(5) the State dropped charges against another defendant in a similar \"he-said, she-said\" \nrape case.\" (D.I. 1) \nA review of the Petition reveals that it is a second or successive habeas \napplication within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. First, the Petition challenges the \nsame 2007 convictions that Petitioner challenged in his first federal habeas proceeding. \nSecond, the dismissal of Petitioner's first habeas petition as time-barred constitutes an \nadjudication on the merits for\u00a7 2244 purposes. See Murray v. Greiner, 394 F.3d 78, 81 \n(2d Cir.2005) (holding that dismissal of \u00a7 2254 petition as time barred constitutes \nadjudication on merits for successive purposes); Altman v. Benik, 337 F.3d 764, 766 \n(7th Cir.2003) (holding that \"a statute of limitations bar is not a curable technical or \nprocedural deficiency but rather operates as an irremediable defect barring \n4 consideration of the petitioner's substantive claims\"). Third, although Petitioner \ncharacterizes the arguments in his instant Petition as \"new evidence,\" he either did, or \ncould have, asserted all but the argument based on another he-said she-said scenario \nin his first petition. Moreover, to the extent Petitioner's allegations regarding the \"new \nevidence\" actually constitute \"new evidence\", such evidence must be presented to the \nThird Circuit for a determination as to whether the \"new evidence\" is sufficient to avoid \nthe second/successive bar. \nPetitioner does not assert, and nothing in the record indicates, that the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals authorized the filing of the instant second or successive habeas \nPetition. The Court finds that it is not in the interest of justice to transfer this case to the \nThird Circuit, because the Petition does not come close to satisfying the substantive \nrequirements for a second or successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Given \nthese circumstances, the Court will dismiss the Petition for lack of jurisdiction because it \nconstitutes an unauthorized second or successive petition. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the instant Petition constitutes \nan unauthorized second or successive request for habeas relief. Therefore, the Court \nwill summarily dismiss the Petition for lack of jurisdiction. The Court will also decline to \nissue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner has failed to make a \"substantial \nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. \n5 L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate \nOrder will be entered. \nDated: March 7, 2022 \nColm F. Connolly \nChief Judge \n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nLYNWOOD C. TAYLOR, \nPetitioner , \nV. \nSTATE OF DELAWARE , and ATTORNEY \nGENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, \nRespondents. Civ. A. No. 20-1494-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this Seventh day of March in 2022 for the reasons set forth in the \nMemorandum issued this date; \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Petitioner Lynwood C. Taylor's Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (D.I. 3) is DISMISSED and the writ is DENIED for lack of \njurisdiction . \n2. Petitioner 's Motion for Leave to Proceed In Forma Pauperis (D.I. 1) is \nDISMISSED as moot. \n3. The Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner \nhas failed to satisfy the standards set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) . \nChief Judge "}
