Counsel for Defendant Connections CSP. \nAugust ( U , 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION ~~ e St es istrict Judge: \nPlaintiff, an inmate at the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution , Wilmington , \nDelaware , filed this lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging violations of his \nconstitutional rights. (D.I. 3). He appears prose and was granted permission to \nproceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. The original complaint , \neffectively filed on May 20, 2021 was dismissed , and Plaintiff was given leave to amend. \n(D.I. 22, 23). The Amended Complaint , effectively filed November 19, 2021, is the \noperative pleading. (D.I. 26). Before the Court is a motion to dismiss filed by \nDefendants Centurion , Jasvir Kaur, and William Ngwa. (D.I. 66) The motion is fully \nbriefed. (D.I. 66, 67, 68, 71, 75). There are also about 44 unresolved motions filed by \nPlaintiff. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint and assumed to be \ntrue for purposes of deciding the pending motion. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., \nInc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff alleges that the events complained of \noccurred after May 20, 2019.1 (D.I. 26 at 1). He alleges that Centurion , Kaur, and \nNgwa violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment when they denied him timely and \nproper medical care and treatment and deviated from the standard of care. (Id. at 1-2, \n8). \nPlaintiff was first treated by a nurse practitioner who is no longer employed by \nCenturion . (Id. at 2). Next, he was treated by Kaur who \"began managing Plaintiff's \n1 Because the Amended Complaint adds events that occurred after the filing of the \noriginal complaint , it is at least in part a supplemental pleading pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 15(d). \n1 health care including his left leg wound.\" (/d.). Plaintiff alleges that Kaur and Ngwa \ndid not, and do not, possess the knowledge and expertise required to treat a patient \nsuffering from the illnesses Plaintiff is battling. (Id. at 3). He alleges that Centurion did \nnot provide proper training and oversight. Plaintiff alleges that his health records \nadvised Centurion and Kaur of \"his history of blood clots; renal disease; stroke history; \nedema; epilepsy; traumatic brain injury and other serious medical issues\" and that he \nhad a left leg wound that \"was obvious to anyone.\" (/d.). Plaintiff submitted a \"sick \ncall\" request due to his concerns of a blood clot in his left leg and alleges that \"his \nconcerns were ignored by Centurion and especially Kaur.\" (Id. at 3-4). Plaintiff was \neventually diagnosed and treated for a blood clot in the left leg. (/d.). Plaintiff \ncomplains that he did not see a vascular specialist , and that no \"vascular consult\" was \narranged until November 17, 2021, and then only after Centurion was ordered to \nrespond to Plaintiff's request for a vascular examination . (Id. at 5, 7 (referring to 0.1. \n21)). Plaintiff also alleges that Centurion opposed releasing him from Level 5 custody \nbecause of \"corporate greed;\" it wanted to continue to bill Medicaid/Medicare. (0.1. 26 \nat 6, 8). \nPlaintiff described submitting two grievances : No. 565588 and No. 579859. \n(See 0.1. 68, 69). Plaintiff filed the actual grievances on the docket. (0.1. 69-2). He \nfiled the Amended Complaint on November 19, 2021 .2 Plaintiff seeks compensatory \n2 The computation of time for complaints filed by pro se inmates is determined \naccording to the \"mailbox rule.\" See Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266 (1988); Bums v. \nMorton, 134 F.3d 109, 112 (3d Cir. 1998); Gibbs v. Decker, 234 F. Supp. 2d 458,463 \n(D. Del. 2002). Plaintiff signed the Amended Complaint on November 19 , 2021, and \nthat is the earliest date possible that Plaintiff could have submitted the Amended \nComplaint to prison officials for filing. The Court construes the Amended Complaint as \nhaving been filed on November 19, 2021. \n2 damages. (Id. at 9). \nThe Amended Complaint contains nothing that could be construed as a factual \nallegation of some specific treatment , or lack of treatment , by Defendant Ngwa. There \nis no basis in the Amended Complaint for Ngwa to be a defendant. \nII. LEGAL ST AN DAROS \nBecause Plaintiff proceeds prose, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nAmended Complaint , \"however in artfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent \nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, \n94 (2007). To state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \n\"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the complaint \nmust set forth enough factual matter, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.\" Be// At/. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim \nis facially plausible when the factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, \nsupported by mere conclusory statements , do not suffice.\" Id. \nWhen considering Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, the Court must accept as \ntrue all factual allegations in the complaint and view them in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiff. Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542 F.3d at 64. The Court, however, is \"not \nbound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation .\" Papasan \nv. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986). \n3 Ill. DISCUSSION \nDefendants move to dismiss on the grounds that some claims are time-barred ; \nthe Amended Complaint fails to state claims upon which relief can be granted; and \nPlaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies . Plaintiff opposes. The Court \nturns to the case dispositive issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies . \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") provides, \"No action shall be brought \nwith respect to prison conditions under section 1983 or any other Federal law, by a \nprisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative \nremedies as are available are exhausted .\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). \"The PLRA's \nexhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve \ngeneral circumstances or particular episodes , and whether they allege excessive force \nor some other wrong.\" Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002). The PLRA requires \n\"proper exhaustion ,\" meaning exhaustion of those administrative remedies that are \n\"available .\" Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 93 (2006). \nBecause an inmate's failure to exhaust under PLRA is an affirmative defense, the \ninmate is not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint. \nJones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211-17 (2007); Small v. Camden Cty., 728 F.3d 265,268 \n(3d Cir. 2013). Failure to exhaust administrative remedies must be pied and proved by \nthe defendant. Rinaldi v. United States, 904 F.3d 257, 268 (3d Cir. 2018). When a \ndefendant shows that a plaintiff inmate did not exhaust administrative remedies , the \nplaintiff has the burden of showing that administrative remedies were not available. Id. \nFactual disputes about exhaustion are issues for the court to decide, but only after \nnotice and an opportunity for the parties to submit relevant materials. Id. at 265. \n4 Defendants argue that Plaintiff did not exhaust his administrative remedies prior \nto filing the Supplemental Pleading . A supplemental pleading adds post-complaint \nevents to the operative pleading, does not supersede it, and treats the events alleged \nas part of the original complaint. Korb v. Haystings , 860 F. App'x 222, 226 & n.5 (3d \nCir. 2021) (analyzing Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69 (3d Cir. 2019), cert. \ndenied, 140 S Ct. 1611 (2020)), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 1111 (2022). Because a \ncomplaint is \"brought\" under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the Rules allow a \nplaintiff to supplement his complaint to show exhaustion after filing the complaint and \ndoing so complies with the PLRA. Id. at n.4. A supplemental pleading may cure \njurisdictional defects, and non-jurisdictional defects, such as the PLRA's affirmative \ndefense of exhaustion. Id. (citations omitted). \nIn response to Defendants ' motion, Plaintiff refers to two grievances he \nsubmitted . The first, Grievance #565588 , was submitted May 12, 2021 and complains \nof contracting COVID-19. (D.I. 69-2 at 3). \"I am experienc ing ongoing symptoms from \ncontracting COVID-19 due to the negligence of DOC and Centurion who both failed to \nadhere to CDC published COVID-19 Guidance provided by the CDC regarding social \ndistancing and contact tracing.\" (Id.). According to papers filed by Plaintiff, this \ngrievance was still unresolved when he commenced this suit. (Id. at 2 (memo stat ing the \ngrievance would \"tentatively \" be heard on June 9, 2021)). Plaintiff has/has not shown \nthat it was subsequently exhausted . (0.1. 69-2). Thus, it cannot be the basis for \nadministrative exhaustion . Exhaustion must be completed before a complaint is filed. \nSee Ahmed v. Dragovich , 297 F.3d 201, 209 & n.9 (3d Cir. 2002). Regardless , \nGrievance #565588 cannot help Plaintiff; it is a COVID-19 grievance . This grievance \n5 does not support Plaintiff's position that he exhausted his administrative remedies as \nthere are no COVID claims in the Amended Complaint. The grievance does not mention \nPlaintiff's leg, a leg wound, or a vascular problem . \nThe second, Grievance #579859 , was filed during the pendency of this lawsuit. \nIt was submitted November 5, 2021, complains that Plaintiff was informed by Centurion \nstaff on November 2, 2021, that he needed to have a blood sample drawn for a renal \nwork-up because, in March 2021, the original work-up was \"incorrectly entered\" into the \nsystem, and \"negligently ordered\" 3 by Kaur. (Id. at 4, 5). The Medical Grievance \nCommittee upheld the grievance on November 30, 2021, and the grievance was \n\"resolved. \" (Id. at 6). The grievance appears to have been exhausted , but it too \nappears to be a complaint about an event (blood work relating to renal disease) that is \nnot mentioned in the Amended Complaint , which is about a leg wound, blood clots, a \nvascular specialist , and the drug Eliquis.4 Thus, the second grievance does not serve \nto have administratively exhausted the claims he makes in the Amended Complaint. \nAccordingly , the Court will grant moving Defendants ' motion to dismiss for \nPlaintiff's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies .5 Dismissal is without \nprejudice . The Court will permit Plaintiff to amend his complaint one final time. The \nCourt does so because it is possible, although it seems unlikely, that Plaintiff filed some \n3 I take \"negligently ordered\" to mean that it was negligently entered into the system. \n4 The Amended Complaint does include one sentence , \"Also, the Court is reminded that \nKaur recently discovered a renal mistake from 8 months ago.\" (D.I. 26 at 9). But that \nis not what the Amended Complaint is complaining about. \n5 The Court will not address the other grounds for dismissal raised in the Amended \nComplaint. \n6 other grievance that has been exhausted and that relates to the issues raised in this \nsuit. And, while the parties have briefed and submitted papers relative to the \nadministrative exhaustion issue, there was no formal notice from the Court that it would \nconsider and resolve the issue. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court: (1) the Court will grant the motion to dismiss \nfiled by Defendants Centurion , Jasvir Kaur, and William Ngwa (D.I. 66); and (2) dismiss \nas moot all of Plaintiffs motions (D.I. 19, 24, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, \n42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49, 52, 55, 56, 59,61,64,65,69, 71, 73, 77, 78, 83, 95, 96, \n87, 91, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 100). \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n7 "}
