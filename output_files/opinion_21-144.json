{"case_name": "Stokes v. Centurion Health", "case_number": "21-144", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "12-29-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nTERRANCE J.M. STOKES, )\nPlaintiff,\nVv. Civ. No. 21-144-CFC\nCENTURION HEALTH,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n1. Introduction. Plaintiff Terrance J.M. Stokes proceeds pro se and has\n\nbeen granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.|.7) He alleges constitutional\nviolations and medical negligence. (D.1. 2) The matter proceeds on the Amended\nComplaint. (D.1. 18) Defendant moves to dismiss (D.1. 22), and Plaintiff moves to\nsupplement his responses (D.. 27, 28),' for discovery (D.I. 29, 30), and for appointment\nof counsel (D.1. 30).\n\n2. Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiff alleges there was a delay in medical\ntreatment and, that, when it was provided, the medical treatment was inadequate. (D.I.\n18) Centurion Health, the sole defendant, moves to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6) on the grounds that the Amended Complaint does not provide facts of an Eighth\nor Fourteenth Amendment violation as it fails to allege a policy or custom that is\nresponsible for violating Plaintiff's constitutional rights. (D.I.22) In order to establish\nthat Defendant is directly liable for the alleged constitutional violations, Plaintiff \u201cmust\n\nprovide evidence that there was a relevant [Centurion] policy or custom, and that the\n\n1 The motions (D.1. 27, 29) will be granted and the supplements will be considered.\n1\npolicy caused the constitutional violation[s] [plaintiff] allege[s].\u201d Natale v. Camden\nCounty Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 584 (3d Cir. 2003). Defendant is correct that the\nAmended Complaint contains no such allegations. Plaintiff's attempt to remedy the\npleading defects through his oppositions (D.1. 26, 27, 29) is not allowed. See Frederico\nv. Home Depot, 507 F.3d 188, 202 (3d Cir. 2007) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that the complaint may\nnot be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss\u201d (internal quotation and\ncitation omitted); Carpenters Health 86 Welfare Fund of Phila. & Vicinity v. Mgmt. Res.\nSys., 837 F.3d 378, 383 (3d Cir. 2016) (party may not amend complaint in brief opposing\na motion to dismiss).\n\n3. Defendant also moves to dismiss the medical negligence claim on the\ngrounds that Plaintiff did not follow the requirements under Delaware law. (D.I.22) For\na medical negligence claim, Plaintiff must file an affidavit of merit signed by an expert\nwitness supporting the claim. See 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853(a)(1). Defendant is correct that\nPlaintiff did not do so.\n\n4. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss will be granted. (D.I.22) Because it is\npossible that Plaintiff may be able to cure the pleading defects of the alleged\nconstitutional violations, he will be given leave to amend the claim. Amendment is futile\nas to the medical negligence claim raised under state law.\n\n5. Discovery Motions. The Court will deny Plaintiff's motion for a hearing.\n(D.I. 29) While not clear, it seems that Plaintiff either seeks discovery or copies of every\nitem on the Court docket. A hearing is not necessary. To the extent Plaintiff seeks\nevery item on the Court docket, he is advised that there is a cost associated with the\nrequest which must be prepaid before the copies are provided. The Clerk of Court will\n\nbe directed to provide Plaintiff a copy of the Court docket. Plaintiff may request copies\n2\nfrom the Clerk of Court and upon doing so, will be advised of the cost. Plaintiff also\nrequests Defendant's health statement and policy. (D.I.30) The discovery request is\npremature and will be denied.\n\n6. Request for Counsel. Plaintiff requests counsel on the grounds that he\n\u201ccan't comprehend,\u201d \u201cnever completed school,\u201d to assist in discovery, and to perform a\nproper investigation. (D.I. 30) Apro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no\nconstitutional or statutory right to representation by counsel.2 See Brightwell v. Lehman,\n637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).\nHowever, representation by counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances,\nafter a finding that a plaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d\nat 155.\n\n7. After passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of\nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in\ndeciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the\nmerits of the plaintiff's claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her case\nconsidering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon him\nor her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues, (4) the degree to which\nfactual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue such investigation; (5)\nthe plaintiff's capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and (6) the degree to\nwhich the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony. See Montgomery\n\nVv. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155-56. The list is\n\n2 See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of lowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989)\n(\u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7 4915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling\nattorney to represent an indigent civil litigant, the operative word in the statute being\n\u201crequest.\u201d).\n\n3\nnot exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.\n\n8. Several of the Tabron factors militate against granting Plaintiff's request for\ncounsel at this time. There is no operative pleading, the Amended Complaint having\nbeen dismissed and Plaintiff having been given leave to amend. In addition, Plaintiffs\nfilings indicate that he understands the issues he raises and adequately addresses those\nissues. For these reasons, the Court will deny the request for counsel without prejudice\nto renew.\n\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED this Twenty-ninth day of December 2022, that:\n\n1. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. (D.I. 22) Plaintiff is given\nleave to file a second amended complaint solely as constitutional medical needs claim on\nor before January 20, 2023. The Clerk of Court will be directed to close the case should\nPlaintiff fail to timely file a second amended complaint.\n\n2. Plaintiffs motions to supplement his response are GRANTED. (D.I. 27,\n28)\n\n3. Plaintiff's motion for a hearing and to release all material is DENIED. (D.I.\n29) The Clerk of Court is directed to provide Plaintiff one free copy of the Court docket.\n\n4. Plaintiff's motion for discovery is DENIED as premature. (D.I. 30)\n\n5. Plaintiff's request for counsel is DENIED without prejudice to renew. (D.I.\n\nEe Judge\n\n30)\n\n"}
