No. 20-997-LPS \nDELAWARE DOC, et al., \nDefendants. \nKelly E.S. Aliahmed, Sussex Correctional Institution, Georgetown, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nJune 13, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORAND UM OPINION f~P-~ \nSTARK, U.S. Circuit Judge: \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Kelly E.S. Aliahmed (\"Aliahmed \" or \"Plaintiff\" ) 1, an inmate at the Sussex \nCorrectional Institution in Georgetown, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.2 \n(D.I. 1) She was housed at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center (\"JVCC'') in Smyrna, \nDelaware when she commenced this action. She appears prose and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 9) The Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and\u00a7 1915A(a). \nII. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff filed this action on her behalf and on behalf of all Delaware inmates. She alleges \nthat Defendants Delaware Department of Correction (''DOC''), Delaware Department of Justice \n(''DO]''), and the State of Delaware (\"the State'') are denying inmates their civil constitutional rights \nto vote. She seeks injunctive relief. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious , fails to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from \nsuch relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (informa \npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from governmental \n1 Recently, Aliahmed changed her name to Cea G. Mai, as noted on the docket on April 5, 2022. \nThe Court refers to her herein by the name used in the operative pleadings . \n2 When bringing a\u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a \nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See \nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n1 defendant ); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions). The \nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to a prose plaintiff. See Phillips v. Counry of Alleghe1!J, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiffs proceed prose, their pleading is liberally \nconstrued and the Complaint, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards \nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" En\"ckson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley v. \nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also \nGrqyson v. Mqyview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). ''Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or \ndelusional\" factual scenario.\"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d \n523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule \n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B )). However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted \npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a \nPlaintiff leave to amend unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grqyson, 293 F.3d at \n114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bel/At/. Corp. v. Twomb!J, 550 \n2 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations\" are not required, a complaint must do \nmore than simply provide ''labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.\" Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Wiffiams v. BASF Cata!Jsts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, \n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twomb!J, 550 U.S. at 570). \nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility . See \nJohnson v. City of Shefl?J, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect \nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nUnder the pleading regime established by Twomb!J and Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency \nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a \nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume \ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See \nConnel!J v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task \nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id \nIV. DISCUSSION \nA. Non-Attorney \nThe Complaint is signed by Aliahmed, who is not an attorney. As a non-attorney, she may \nnot act as an attorney for the other Plaintiffs. Aliahmed may only represent herself in this Court. \nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654; see also Osei-Afrzje v. The Medical Co/L of Pennsylvania, 937 F.2d 876 (3d Cir. 1991) \n3 (non-lawyer appearingpro se may not act as attorney for his children); In the MatterofChojecki, 2000 \nWL 679000, at *2 (E.D. Pa. May 22, 2000) (\"Although a non-attorney may appear in propria \npersona on his own behalf, that privilege is personal to him and he has no authority to appear as the \nattorney for anyone other than himself.\"). \nB. Eleventh Amendment \nPlaintiffs' claims fail for two reasons. First, in Delaware an individual convicted of a felony \nloses his or her voting rights. Under Delaware law, an applicant for voter registration who has been \nconvicted of a felony which is not disqualifying but who has not served the required sentence of \nimprisonment, parole, work release, early release, supervised custody, and probation and community \nsupervision, is denied his or her registration application. See 15 Del. C. \u00a7 6103(c). \nSecond, Defendant s are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The State has \nimmunity under the Eleventh Amendment, as does the DOC and the DOJ. See Anderson v. Phelps, \n830 F. App'x 397, 398 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Korns v. Shanahan, 879 F.3d 504, 513 (3d Cir. 2018));. \nAlston v. Administrative Offices of Delaware Courls, 178 F. Supp. 3d 222, 229 (D. Del.), ajfd, 663 F. App'x \n105 (3d Cir. 2016). \nThe Eleventh Amendment protects states and their agencies from suit in federal court \nregardless of the kind of relief sought. See Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, \n100 (1984). \"Absent a state's consent, the Eleventh Amendment bars a civil rights suit in federal \ncourt that names the state as a defendant.\" Laskaris v. Thornburgh, 661 F.2d 23, 25 (3d Cir. 1981) \n(citing Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781 (1978)). Delaware has not waived its immunity from suit in \nfederal court; although Congress can abrogate a state's sovereign immunity, it did not do so through \nthe enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Jones v. Sussex Con: Inst., 725 F. App'x 157, 159-160 (3d Cir. \n2017)); Brooks-McCollum v. Delaware, 213 F. App'x 92, 94 (3d Cir. 2007). In addition, dismissal is \n4 proper because the State Defendants are not persons for purposes of\u00a7 1983. See Wzll v. Michigan \nDep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71(1989); Calhoun v. Young, 288 F. App'x 47 (3d Cir. 2008). \nAccordingly, Defendants will be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii) and \n1915A(b)(2) based upon their immunity from suit. \nV. CONCL USION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint as frivolous and based upon \nDefendants immunity from suit. The Court finds that amendment would be futile. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nMRS. KELLY E.S. ALIAHMED and \nALL DE INMATES, \nPlaintiffs, \nV. : Civ. No. 20-997-LPS \nDELAWARE DOC, et al., \nDefendants. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 13th day of June, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion \nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED as frivolous and based upon Defendants' immunity \nfrom suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (iii) and 1915A(b)(1) and (2). Amendment is \nfutile. \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case. \n!4JP-~ UNI D STATES DISTRICT COURT "}
