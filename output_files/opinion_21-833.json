No. 21-833- CFC\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nPending before the Court are (1) Defendant Beckman Coulter, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cBeckman\u2019s\u201d) Partial \nMotion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (D.I. 10) and \n(2)Plaintiff Becton , Dickinson and Company\u2019s (\u201cBD\u2019s\u201d) Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (D.I.\n17).  As announced from the bench on January 10, 2022, I recommend that the Court DENY both motions without prejudice to Beckman\u2019s  ability to raise its 35 U.S.C. \u00a7  101 arguments at the \nsummary judgment stage.   \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\nA. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201c To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018 state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201c factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reas onable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged. \u201d  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.   \u201cWhere \na complaint pleads facts that are \u2018 merely consistent with \u2019 a defendant \u2019s liability, it \u2018 stops short of Redacted - Public Version\n2 the line between possibility and plausibility  of entitlement to relief.\u2019\u201d  Id . (quoting Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 557).   \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint, I must assume all \u201cwell-pleaded facts\u201d are \ntrue but need not assume the truth of legal conclusions.  Id. at 679.  \u201c[W]hen the allegations in a \ncomplaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, th is basic deficiency \nshould be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the \ncourt.\u201d  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nB. Patent Eligibility Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\nSection 101 defines th e categories of subject matter that are patent eligib le.  It provides: \n\u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition \nof matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the \nconditions and requirements of this title.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  Th e Supreme Court has recognized \nthree exceptions to the broad statutory categories of patent-e ligible subject matter: \u201cl aws of nature, \nnatural phenomena, and abst ract ideas\u201d are not patent-e ligible.  Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, \n185 (1981).  \u201cW hether a claim recites patent-e ligible subject matter is a questio n of law which may \ncontain disputes over underlying facts.\u201d  Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. \n2018). \nThe Supreme Court has established a two-s tep test for determining whether  patent claims \nare invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l, 573 U.S. 208 (2014).  In step \none, the court must \u201cdetermine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-i nelig ible \nconcept.\u201d  Id. at 218. This first step requires the court to \u201cexamine the \u2018focus\u2019 of the claim, i.e., its \n\u2018character as a whole, \u2019 in order to determine whether the claim is directed to\u201d an ineligible concept.  \nEpic IP LLC v. Backblaze, Inc., 351 F. Supp. 3d 733, 736 (D. Del. 2018) (Bryson, J.) (quoting SAP 3 Am., Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC, 898 F.3d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Internet Pats. Corp. v. Active \nNetwork, Inc., 790 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2015)). \nBecause \u201call inventions . . . embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural \nphenomena, or abstract ideas,\u201d Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., \n566 U.S. 66, 71 (2012), \u201ccourts \u2018must be careful to avoid oversimplifying the claims\u2019 by looking \nat them generally and failing to account for the specific requirements of the claims.\u201d  McRO v. \nBandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting In re TLI \nCommc\u2019ns LLC Pat. Litig., 823 F.3d 607, 611 (Fed. Cir. 2016));  see also Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft \nCorp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (\u201c[D]escribing the claims at [too] high [a]  level o f \nabstraction and untethered from the language of the claims all but ensures that the exceptions to \n\u00a7 101 swallow the rule.\u201d) .  \u201cAt step one, therefore, it is not enough to merely identify a patent-\nineligible concept underlying the claim; [the court] must determine wh ether that p atent-i neligible \nconcept is what the claim is \u2018directed to.\u2019\u201d Rapid Litig. Mgmt. Ltd. v. CellzDirect, Inc., 827 F.3d \n1042, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2016). If the claims are not directed to a patent-ineligible concept, then the \nclaims are patent-e ligible under \u00a7 101 and the analys is is over.  If, however, the claims are directed \nto a patent-ineligible concept, then the a nalysis proceeds to step two. \nAt step two, the court \u201cconsider[s] the elements of each claim both individually and as an \nordered combination\u201d to d etermine if  ther e is an \u201cinventive concept\u2014 i.e., an element or \ncombination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to \nsignificantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.\u201d Alice, 573 U.S. at 217-18 \n(internal quotations and citations omitted).  \u201cIt is well-s ettled that mere recitation of concrete, \ntangible components is insufficient to confer patent eligibility to an otherwise abstract idea.\u201d  TLI \nCommc\u2019ns, 823 F.3d at 613. Thus, \u201c[m]erely reciting the use of a generic computer or adding the words \u2018apply it with a computer\u2019 \u201d does not transform a patent-i neligible concept into patent \neligible subject matter.  Two-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast Cable Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 874 F.3d 1329, \n1338 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting Alice, 573 U.S. at 223).  Nor is there an inventive concept when \nthe claims \u201c[s]imply append[] conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality\u201d to a \npatent-ineligible concept.  Alice, 573 U.S. at 222. \nConversely, claims pass muster at step two when they \u201cinvolve more than performance of \nwell-understood, routine, and conventional activities previously known to the industry.\u201d \nBerkheimer, 881 F.3d at 1367 (citation and internal marks omitted).  \u201cThe mere fact that someth ing \nis disclosed in a piece of prior ar t . . . does not mean it was well-understood, routine, and \nconventional.\u201d  Id. at 1369.  Moreover, \u201can inventive concept can be found in the non-conventional \nand non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\u201d  Bascom Glob. Internet Servs., Inc. \nv. AT&T Mobility LLC, 827 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016) .  Whether an activity was well-\nunderstood, routine, or conventional to a person of ordinary skill in the art is a question of fact. \nBerkheimer, 881 F.3d at 1368. \nC. Preliminary Injunct ion\nA preliminary injunction is \u201cextraordinary\u201d relief.  Winter v. Nat\u2019l Res. Def. Council, Inc. , \n555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008);  Kos Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 708 (3d Cir. 2004) \n(\u201cPreliminary injunctive relief is \u2018a n extraordinary remedy\u2019 and \u2018should be granted only in limited \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d) (quoting AT&T Co. v. Winback & Conserve Program, Inc. , 42 F.3d 1421, 1427 \n(3d Cir. 1994));  Intel Corp. v. ULSI Sys. Tech., Inc., 995 F.2d 1566, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1993) \n(\u201c[A] p reliminary injunction i s a drastic and extraordinary remedy that is not to be routinely \ngranted.\u201d).  To obtain a preliminary injunction, the movant has the burden to demonstrate (1) a \nlikelihood of success on the merits,  (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm if an injunction is not \ngranted, (3) that the balance of equities tips in the movant\u2019s favor, and (4) that an injunction is in 4 5 II. DI\nSCUSSION\nMy report and recommendation on the pending motions  was announced from the bench as\nfollows: \nThis is my Report and Recommendation on Defendant \nBeckman \u2019s partial motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and BD \u2019s motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.   \nI\n will summarize the reasons for my recommendations in a \nmoment.  But before I do, I want to be clear that  my failure to \naddress a particular argument advanced by a party does not mean \nthat I did not consider it.   We have carefully considered all of the arguments made by both sides.  We will not be issuing a separate written report, but we will issue a written document incorporating the recommendations that I am about to make. the public interest.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20; K.A. ex rel. Ayers v. Pocono Mountain Sch. Dist., \n710 F.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir. 2013); Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., 566 F.3d 999, 1005 \n(Fed. Cir. 2009).   \nTo demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits (factor (1)) in a patent infringement \ncase, the patentee must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to succeed in establishing \ninfringement.  Revision Mil., Inc. v. Balboa Mfg. Co., 700 F.3d 524, 526 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (\u201c[T]he \nestimated likelihood of success in establishing [patent] infringement is governed by Federal Circuit \nlaw\u201d).  If the patentee fails to make that showing, the court cannot issue a preliminary injunction.  \nAmazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, Inc., 239 F.3d 1343, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\u201cOu r case \nlaw and logic both require that a movant cannot be granted a preliminary injunction unless it \nestablishes both of the first two factors, i.e., likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable \nharm.\u201d); NutraSweet Co. v. Vit-Mar Enterprises, Inc., 176 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir. 1999) (\u201cA \nplaintiff\u2019s  failure to establish any element in  its favor renders a pr eliminary injunction \ninappropriate.\u201d) . 6 T\nhe relevant procedural history is as follows.  BD filed this \nsuit for patent infringement on June 7, 2021.  BD filed an Amended \nComplaint on July 21, 2021.   \nT\nhe amended complaint alleges that certain of Beckman \u2019s \nCytoFLEX Cytometer products infringe four of BD \u2019s patents.1  The \nmotions we are discussing today implicate only two of those patents: the \u2019197 patent and the \u2019875 patent. \nO\nn July 29, 2021, Beckman filed a partial motion to dismiss \nfor failure to state a claim.  (D.I. 10.)   Beckman asserts that the \u2019197 patent is invalid under \u00a7 101 because its claims are directed to \nineligible subject matter. That motion is fully briefed.  (D.I. 11 ; D.I.  \n12; D.I.  15; D.I.  27.)  The parties did not request oral argument.   \nO\nn August 23, 2021, BD filed a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction to stop Beckman from selling CytoFLEX SRT Benchtop Cell Sorters that are alleged to use technology claimed in BD \u2019s \u2019875 \npatent.  (D.I. 17.)  The parties stipulated to an extended briefing schedule on the PI  motion, which resulted in BD not filing its reply \nbrief until December 20, 2021.    On January 3, 2022, Beckman filed a motion for leave to file a sur -reply, which the Court granted on \nJanuary 5, 2022.  Briefing on the PI  motion is now complete.  (D.I. \n18; D.I. 19; D.I. 20; D.I. 21; D.I. 22; D.I. 23; D.I. 24; D.I. 46; D.I. 47; D.I. 48; D.I. 49; D.I. 50; D.I. 51; D.I. 52; D.I. 71; D.I. 72; D.I. 73; D.I. 74; D.I. 75; D.I. 87; D.I. 89.)  The Court heard oral argument on January 7, 2022.\n2 \nI\n will start with B eckman \u2019s partial motion to dismiss based \non \u00a7 101.  (D.I. 10.)  Having carefully reviewed and considered the \npapers submitted by the parties, I recommend that the Court deny the motion without prejudice to Beckman\u2019 s ability to renew its \u00a7 101 \narguments at the summary judgment stage. . . . \nT\nhe \u2019197 patent has 13 claims.  Claims 1, 5, and 6 are \nindependent.  Beckman says that all 13 claims are directed to unpatentable subject matter.   There appears to be a threshold dispute \nbetween the parties about whether it is appropriate to treat claim 1 \n1 U.S. Patent Nos. 6,683,314, 7,129,505, 7,201,875, and 7,787,197. \n2 (\u201cTr. __.) 7 as representative of all 13 claims.3  Beckman \u2019s opening brief \ncontended that claim 1 is representative; BD says it\u2019s not. \nB\nD has raised  arguments as to the patentability of each of \nthe claims.  Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to conclude that \nall of the claims are unpatentable simply because claim 1 is unpatentable.  However, because Beckman contends that claim 1 is representative,  and because I reject Beckman \u2019s arguments regarding \nclaim 1, Beckman \u2019s motion should be denied and the Court need not \nconsider the remaining claims at this stage.  \nN\neither side has identified any claim construction dispute \nthat needs to be resolved before  the Court can assess the \u00a7 101 issue.  \nThe Court will now proceed to dance the Alice  two-step. \nT\nhe Court is directed at step one to examine the focus of the \nclaim to determine whether the claim is directed to a patent-ineligible concept.  [ Claim 1 reads as follows :  \n1.\nAn optical analyzer comprising:\n(a) a light source adapted to emit an approximately\ncollimated light beam along a light path; \n(b) a focusing lens positioned in the light path,\nadapted to focus the light beam onto a focal spot within a sample analysis region, wherein said focusing lens has a focal length f\n1,  \n(c) beam -adjusting optics positioned in the light path\nbetween the light source and the focusing lens, wherein said beam -adjusting optics \ncomprises at least one beam -adjusting lens \nthat is mounted in a positioning device that allows movement of the beam -adjusting lens \nin a plane perpendicular to the light path, wherein said beam -adjusting lens has a focal \nlength f\n2, wherein said beam -adjusting lens \nand said focusing lens are separated by a distance z along the light path, and wherein \n|f\n2-z|\u22674\u00b7f1.] \n3 \u201cCourts may treat a claim as representative in certain situations, such as if the patentee \ndoes not present any meaningful argument for the distinctive significance of any claim limitations not found in the representative claim or if the parties agree to treat a claim as representative. \u201d  \nBerkheimer , 881 F.3d at  1365.  \u201cA claim is not representative simply because it is an independent \nclaim. \u201d  Id.   8 Beckman says that claim 1 is directed either to the natural \nlaw of demagnification or to the abstract idea of the claimed formula \n|f2-z|\u22674\u00b7f1.  \nI\n don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s seriously disputed that the claimed \napparatus takes advantage of the natural law of demagnification. \nAnd it is also true that the claim sets forth a mathematical relationship that restricts the possible focal lengths of the lenses and \nthe possible distance between them.  \nH\nowever, under longstanding Supreme Court precedent, \nsuch a tangible apparatus can be patentable subject matter notwithstanding the fact that it may invoke a mathematical equation, a natural law, or a scientific principle.  As the Supreme Court stated in the Mackay Radio case in 1939, \u201c [w]hile a scientific truth, or the \nmathematical expression of it, is not patentable invention, a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be.\u201d\n4 \nO\nf course, the fact that a claim is an apparatus claim that \nrecites tangible components is not dispositive of its patent -eligibility \neither, as the Federal Circuit recently reaffirmed in the Yu  case.5 \nA\nccordingly, I have looked at claim 1 and examined its \ncharacter as a who le, and I have considered it in light of the \nspecification.  Having done so, the claim appears to me to be directed toward an apparatus that has tangible parts, including a light source, a focusing lens, and a beam adjusting lens that sits between the ligh t source and the focusing lens.  The position of the beam \nadjusting lens can be moved in a plane perpendicular to the light path with a positioning device that results in movement of the focal spot of the light beam within a sample analysis region.  \nT\nhe claims do set forth a mathematical relationship that \nbasically requires the beam -adjusting lens to have a long focal \nlength relative to the distance between the lenses and the focal length of the focusing lens. But no one is saying that the claimed relatio nship is itself \u201c the law of demagnification. \u201d  Nor am I \npersuaded that the claim as a whole is otherwise \u201c directed to \u201d the \nnatural law of demagnification.  \n4 Mackay Radio & Tel. Co. v. Radio Corp. of Am., 306 U.S. 86, 94 (1939). \n5 Yu v. Apple Inc., 1 F.4th 1040, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that a claim to an \u201cimproved \ndigital camera \u201d with an \u201cimage sensor \u201d and \u201c lenses \u201d was nonetheless directed to an \u201c abstract \nidea\u201d ). 9 R\nather, I fear that Beckman has done what the Federal \nCircuit has cautioned against \u2014its proposed description of the focus \nof claim 1 is at too high a level of abstraction and untethered from \nthe language of the claim.6  \nA\ngain, claim 1 requires tangible elements arranged in a \nparticular configuration.  At this point in the case, and on this current record, I am not persuaded that Beckman\u2019 s articulation of the claim \nbeing directed to the natural law of demagnification adequately captures the substance of the claim.     \nB\neckman alternatively says that claim 1 is directed to the \nabstract idea of the mathematical formula set forth in the claim: |f2-\nz|\u22674\u00b7f1 .   I reject that argument for the same reason .  Here, again, I \ndo not think that Beckman\u2019 s proposed abstract idea sufficiently \ncaptures the substance of the claim, which refers to particular  \ntangible elements arranged in a particular configuration.   \nI\nn sum, at this point in the case I am not persuaded that claim \n1 is directed to the natural law or the abstract idea proffered by \nBeckman.   Because I am not persuaded at step one, the Court need \nnot address Alice step two .   \nI\nt may be, however, that claim 1 or the other claims are \ndirected to some other patent -ineligible concept yet to be artic ulated.  \nAccordingly, I recommend that the Court deny Beckman\u2019 s motion \nto dismiss with leave to renew its \u00a7 101 arguments at the summary \njudgment stage.7 \n6  See Enfish , 822 F.3d at  1337; see also  McRO , 837 F.3d at  1313. \n7 See APS Tech., Inc. v.

I have reviewed all of the papers filed in connection with \nthe motion.  We also heard a lengthy oral argument on January 7, 2022.  All of the parties \u2019 arguments have been carefully considered. \nFor the reasons I will discuss, Plaintiff \u2019s request for a preliminary \ninjunction should be denied . . . . \nBD\u2019s\n motion concerns only the \u2019 875 patent.  The patent is \ntitled \u201cFixed Mounted Sorting Cuvette with User Replaceable \nNozzle. \u201d  The patent relates to a scientific technique called flow \ncytometry.  The inventors of the \u2019 875 patent didn\u2019 t invent flow \ncytometry.  That has been around for a long time.  Rather, the specification discloses a flow cytometer having a part icular \nconfiguration that is alleged to be advantageous because it requires less calibration and alignment.\n8 \nT\nhe \u2019875 patent has 26 claims.  Claims 1 and 13 are \nindependent.  [Claim 1 re cites: \n1. A\n flow cell for use with a flow cytometer comprising:\nA flow cell body;A sample delivery tube extending into said flow cell body;At least one sheath flow port on said flow cell body, said at\nleast one port allowing introduction of a flow of sheath flow liquid through said flow cell body; \nA cuvette having flat sides and a rectangular cross -section, \njoined to the flow cell body; \nA channel extending through the cuvette, said channel \ncomprising an initial end and a terminal end, wherein liquid from said sample delivery tube and said at least one sheath flow port flows into said initial end of said channel; and  \nA removable nozzle at said terminal end of said channel  \nthrough which said liquid from said sample delivery tube and said at least one sheath flow port flows out of said channel, wherein said removable nozzle is positioned on a removable nozzle key having hard planar surfaces on a top and on at least two sides , said \nnozzle held in a registered position on said flow cell, said registered position at a defined three -\ndimensional position and at a registered rotational \ndismiss under  \u00a7 101 without prejudice to renew argument at later stage, when the defendant \u2019s \nproposed abstract idea \u201cd [id] not satisfactorily capture the substance of the claims\u201d).  \n8 (See, e.g., \u2019875 patent, 2:59-3:3; 6:19-28.) 11 orientation, wherein said nozzle is held in said \nregistered position by contact between said hard  \nplanar surfaces of said nozzle key and said cuvette. ] \nC\nlaim 13 is similar to claim 1.  It likewise requires, among \nother things, \u201c a removable nozzle [ positioned on a removable nozzle \nkey having hard planar surfaces on a top and on at least two sides, said nozzle held in a registered position . . . at a defined three -\ndimensional position and at a registered rotational orientation, wherein said nozzle is held in said registered position by contact between said hard planar surfaces of said nozzle key and said cuvette].\u201d   \nT\nhe specification explains why the disclosed configuration \nis advantageous [:]   \nIn\n the present invention, significant advantage is \nderived from a configuration in which a number of the optical elements may be fixed with respect to the flow cell.  This advantage arises from the extent of directional stability afforded by the nozzle, which the \nuser may remove and replace and which is self -\naligning.  The nozzle is insertable in the flow cuvette at a location where the nozzle is registered in place. This registration allows the nozzle to be inserted and positioned such that the nozzle is constrained both as to translation and rotation. Because only the nozzle is movable, the flow cell may be fixed, and does not need to be positioned on a stage that may be angularly or directionally repositioned. As a result, \nno removal or replacement of the flow cell is required and the user will not have to adjust or realign the flow cell assembly to align the stream of droplets with a required direction for sorting. \nB\necause the flow cell and flow channel never need to \nbe moved, the other optical elements that must be focused or positioned relative to the flow cell now may be fixed as well ].\n9  \nI\nn 2003, BD launched the FACSAria I sorter, which BD says \nwas the first product to practice the \u2019875 patent.10  Since then, BD \n9 (\u2019875 patent, 8:54-9:5.) \n10 (D.I.  19 (First Bell Decl.) \u00b6\u00b6 15 -16, 21; D.I. 20 (First Chalmers Decl.) \u00b6\u00b6 30, 38.)  12 has introduced several other sorters.11 In March 2021, Beckman \ncommercially launched its CytoFLEX SRT cell sorter.12 BD \ncontends that Beckman\u2019 s CytoFLEX SRT cell sorter infringes the \n\u2019875 patent and it seeks a preliminary injunction to stop Beckman \nfrom selling it.  \nT\no obtain a preliminary injunction, the movant must \ndemonstrate, among other things, a likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  That includes the requirement that a patentee show a likelihood of proving infringement.\n13  To assess whether the \n[patentee ] is likely to establish infringement, the Court  [first] must \ndetermine the meaning and scope of the asserted claims and second must compare the accused product to the construed claims .\n14  \nB\neckman says that BD is unlikely to show that Beckman\u2019 s \nproduct meets the requirements of the \u201cremovable nozzle \u201d \nlimitation.  I agree.  \nA\nll of the \u2019 875 patent claims require \u201c a removable nozzle .  . . \npositioned on a removable nozzle key having hard planar surfaces on a top and on at  least two sides, said nozzle held in a registered \nposition . . . at a defined three -dimensional position and at a \nregistered rotational orientation, wherein said nozzle is held in said registered position by contact between said hard planar surfaces of said nozzle key and said cuvette.\u201d \nBD\u2019s\n theory as to how Beckman\u2019 s product meets that \nlimitation changed over the course of the briefing.  BD \u2019s opening \nbrief referred to the first declaration of its expert, Dr. Chalmers.15  \nDr. Chalmers had not examined  a physical version of the accused \ndevice at the time of his first declaration.  His initial opinion was based on his examination of product literature and other publicly-available information.  In his initial declaration, he stated that \u201c [t]he \nthree- dimen sional position and rotational orientation of the nozzle \n[in the accused device] are defined by contact between the hard planar surfaces of the nozzle holder and the cuvette.  In particular, the hard planar top and sides of the nozzle key (as illustrated [ in \n11 (D.I. 19 \u00b6 21.)   \n12 (Id. \u00b6 22.)   \n13 Metalcraft of Mayville, Inc. v. The Toro Co., 848 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \n14 See Myco Indus., Inc. v. BlephEx, LLC , 955 F.3d 1, 13 (Fed. Cir. 2020). \n15 (D.I. 18 at 14 (citing D.I. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 63 -127).) 13 paragraph 90 of his declaration]16) are raised to the height of the \nnozzle and interface with the cuvette when the nozzle key is locked \nin position.\u201d17 \nN\neither Dr. Chalmers \u2019s declaration nor BD \u2019s opening brief \nsuggested that any claim construction of the term \u201c contact \u201d was \nnecessary.  Nor did they suggest that contact  meant anything other \nthan touching, as Dr. Chalmers\u2019s declaration appeared to suggest that the surfaces he identified were in fa ct touching the cuvette.   \nB\neckman\u2019s answering brief pointed out that the particular \nsurfaces identified by Dr. Chalmers in his initial declaration were not in fact touching the cuvette.  Beckman referred to the declaration of its expert, Dr. Slocum, who performed a physical inspection of \nthe accused device and concluded the same.\n18 \n16 The referenced illustration is set forth below: \n(\nD.I. 20 \u00b6 90.) \n17 (Id. \u00b6 91.) \n18 (D.I. 46 at 9-10 (citing D.I. 49 (Slocum Decl.) \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 50-55).)  Dr. Slocum stated \nthat his physical inspection was consistent with the following illustration:  \n(\nD.I. 49 at \u00b6 55.) \n14 Beckman \u2019s answering brief also contended that the \nCytoFLEX  SRT nozzle holder does not touch the cuvette at all, \nagain pointing to Dr. Slocum \u2019s declaration.  Having inspected the \naccused device, Dr. Slocum opined that the nozzle and O- ring form \na seal with the bottom of the cuvette but that the nozzle holder did \nnot touch the cuvette.19 \nBeck\nman\u2019s answering brief further contended that the \naccused nozzle was not held in position \u201c by contact \u201d between two \nhard planar sides of the nozzle holder and the cuvette.  Rather, Dr. Slocum explained that the nozzle in the accu sed device is held in \nposition by contact between the cylindrical surface of the nozzle and a different V -shaped metal component referred to as a \u201cV-groove.\u201d\n20  \nThe configuration is illustrated in Figure 3 of Dr. Slocum \u2019s \ndeclaration .21 \nIn s\num, Dr. Slocum opined that the nozzle in the accused \ndevice is positioned by line contacts between the curved surface of the nozzle and the V -groove and is further positioned in the axial \ndirection by an interface between the nozzle and the cuvette.\n22 \nTha\nt brings us to BD \u2019s reply brief.  BD \u2019s reply brief set forth \nnew contentions as to which components on the accused device \n19 (See, e.g., D.I. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 53; see also  n. 18, supra.) \n20 (D.I . 49 \u00b6\u00b6 50-53.) \n21 As shown here: \n(D\n.I. 49 \u00b6 52, Fig. 3.) \n22 (Id. \u00b6 53.) \n15 constituted the planar top and side surfaces.23  Accompanying BD \u2019s \nreply brief was a second declaration by Dr. Chalmers.24  Dr. \nChalmers \u2019s second declaration opined that the claimed planar top \nsurface is met by the surface on top of the nozzle in the accused \ndevice, which is in contact with the cuvette.25   \nH\ne also set forth a new contention as to what surfaces in the \naccused device constituted the claimed planar side surfaces.  Dr. Chalmers did not opine, however, that the side surfaces he pointed to are touching the cuvette.  Rather, those surfaces touch, if anything, the flow cell base.  Of course, the claim language requires \u201ccontact between said h ard planar surfaces of said nozzle key and \nsaid cuvette. \u201d  Dr. Chalmers opined that the contact  requirement is \nnevertheless met because there is a \u201c kinematic chain \u201d between the \nflow cell base and the cuvette.\n26  Implicit in his opinion is his view \nthat contact  between two physical components , as it\u2019s used in the \nclaims , does not require touching.27 \nF\nurther, Dr. Chalmers did not opine that the surfaces of the \nnozzle holder alleged to be the side planar surfaces are contacting the flow cell base at the sam e time.  H e explained, \u201c [i]f the nozzle \nholder moves in one direction, the left planar side will make contact with the left wall of the flow cell base, preventing further movement in one direction.  And if the nozzle holder is moved in the other direction, the right planar side will make contact with the right wall of the flow cell base, preventing further movement in the other direction.\u201d\n28  And he acknowledged that there is a \u201ctolerance\u201d\u2014i.e. , \na gap \u2014between the sides of the nozzle holder and the flow cell base, \n23 (D.I. 71 at 9-10.) \n24 (D.I. 73.)   \n25 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 63 -65.) \n26 (Id. \u00b6 69.)   \n27 When I asked BD \u2019s counsel at oral argument for a proposed construction of \u201c contact, \u201d \nhe proffered the following definition: \u201c contact can be either direct or indirect. \u201d  (Tr. 19.)   \n28 (D.I. 73 \u00b6 74.) 16 as illustrated in paragraph 72 of his second declaration.29  Dr. \nChalmers did not measure what the \u201ctolerance\u201d is.30   \nBe\nckman filed a motion for leave to file a sur -reply , which I \ngranted because I concluded that BD had not only changed its \ninfringement theory, it had also adopted a construction of \u201c contact \u201d \nthat could not have been anticipated from its opening brief.31   \nI h\nave carefully reviewed the entire record before the Court.  \nI cannot conclude on this record that BD is likely to succeed in \nshowing that Beckman \u2019s product meets the removable nozzle claim \nrequirements.   As an initial matter, I will assume, for purposes of \nthe argument only, that BD is correct that the top surface  of the \nnozzle meets the requirement that the nozzle key have a top hard planar surface that contacts the cuvette.  Even if that were true, I am not on this record persuaded that BD is likely to succeed in showing that the accused device has two planar sides that contact the cuvette and, along with the top contact, hold the nozzle in a registered three -\ndimensional and rotational position. \nFi\nrst, I am not persuaded that the side planar surfaces pointed \nto by BD contact the cuvette.  BD does not contend that  those \n29 (D.I. 73 \u00b6 72; Tr. 28-33.)  Dr. Chalmers provided the following i llustration:  \n(D.I. 73 \u00b6 72.) \n30 (Tr. 30.)     \n31 (D.I. 78; D.I. 85; D.I. 87; D.I. 89.) \n17 surfaces actually touch the cuvette, and the record evidences that \nthey do not. \nT\nhus, in order for BD to ultimately  succeed in showing \ninfringement, it must obtain a claim construction of contact  that does \nnot require touching.32  At the prelimina ry injunction stage, the \nCourt is permitted to resolve claim construction disputes with \n\u201cpreliminary \u201d or \u201crolling \u201d claim construction rulings.33  My \nrecommendation is that, for purposes of the PI motion, the Court reject a construction of contact  that does not require touching.  The \nword contact  is not a technical term.  When used to describe the \nrelationship between two physical objects in space, it is commonly understood to mean touching.\n34 \nB\nD cites the Bradford case, but that case construed the \nphras e \u201ccoupled to.\u201d35  I am not persuaded that the Bradford case \nhas any bearing on the proper construction of \u201c contact. \u201d \n  \nBD does not suggest that contact  has some special meaning \nin the field of flow cytometry generally.  Rather, BD contends that requiring contact to mean touching would read out the preferred embodiment.  BD \u2019s argument essentially goes like this: The \npreferred embodiment, as illustrated in  Figure 9 of the patent, shows \ntwo sides of the nozzle key that contact the cuvette, the right side and the left side.  Because the right side has a plunger that is interposed between the right side of the nozzle key and the cuvette, there is no direct con tact\u2014i.e.  touching\u2014between the right side and \nthe cuvette.  [ And] because there is no touching in the preferred \nembodiment, contact does not require touching.\n36    \nA\nt this stage of the proceeding, I decline to adopt a \nconstruction that does not require touching.  Even if BD were correct that the independent claims must be construed to cover the \n32 BD\u2019s PI motion does not assert infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.  \n33 Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int\u2019l , 316 F.3d 1331, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (court can adopt \n\u201ctentative \u201d or \u201crolling \u201d claim construction to resolve a PI motion). \n34 Demag Delaval  Turbomachinery Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 264 F.3d 1111, 1124 (Fed. \nCir. 2001)  (\u201cIn the absence of a special definition of the term \u2018 contact \u2019 in the specification, that \nterm should be given its ordinary and accustomed meaning.

Cir. 2010). \n36 (D.I. 71 at 6-8; D.I. 73 \u00b6\u00b6 49-52.) 18 embodiment illustrated in Figure 9, I have closely studied the patent \nand the prosecution history, and I don\u2019 t agree that the right and left \nsides have to be the h ard planar sides called for by claims 1 and 13.  \nIn fact, I think it is unlikely that they can be, as contact between the top, left, and right sides of the nozzle key with the cuvette would not define a registered position in the longitudinal (in/out) direction, as required by the claims.\n37  \nI\nf I had to pick another surface that could be a planar side as \ncalled for by the claims, it\u2019 s at least as likely to be the shoulder \ndescribed in the specification .38 . . .  In other words, there is a way \nfor the independent claims to cover the preferred embodiment without adopting a strained construction of the term contact.   Thus, \nI am not persuaded by BD \u2019s argument that adopting the commonly \nunderstood meaning of contact  would read out the preferred \nembodiment.  \nA\ndopting a preliminary construction of contact that requires \ntouching, it is clear that the planar sides of the nozzle holder identified by BD do not contact the cuvette.  For this independent reason, BD cannot show a likelihood of success on the issue of infringement.\n 39\nI\u2019ll now move on to the second reason I reject BD \u2019s position \nat this stage.  Even if BD were correct that the two identified planar sides of the nozzle key and the top of the nozzle contact the cuvette, I am not persuaded that contact with those surfaces holds the nozzle in a defined three -dimensional position and at a registered rotational \norientation within the meaning of the claims.  \nBD\u2019s\n expert acknowledged that there is \u201ctoleran ce\u201d\u2014i.e. , a \ngap\u2014between the identified planar side surfaces and the flow cell \nsuch that if the nozzle holder were moved back and forth, it would contact one or the other wall of the flow cell base.  He did not opine \n37 (Tr. 15.) \n38 See \u02bc875 patent, 12:55- 59 (\u201cShoulder 311 on nozzle key 214 is appressed against a \nsurface of cuvette 210 when the nozzle key is fully inserted.  This positions the nozzle at a registered position.\u201d);  see also D.I. 78, Ex. 8 (Slocum Depo) at 121:3-17. \n39  Even if contact is not ultimately con strued by the Court to require \u201c direct \u201d contact or \ntouching, it is unlikely that the court would adopt any construction of contact that would encompass two components separated by multiple intermediate components and a gap in space.   \nAs mentioned above, BD \u2019s PI motion did not assert infringement under the doctrine of \nequivalents.   19 that both sides were touching the flow c ell base at the same time.40  \nIn light of that, I agree with Beckman that contacts between the side \nsurfaces identified by BD and the flow cell base (along with contact between the top nozzle surface and the cuvette) do not hold the nozzle in a defined three-di mensional position and rotational \norientation. \nT\no be clear, I don\u2019t think there is any dispute that there does \nhave to be some tolerance between the nozzle key and the flow cell base so that the key can actually be physically inserted.  I do not understand the term contact  to read out such a tolerance.  In other \nwords, I would not construe the term contact to say there c ould be \nno tolerance.  But BD has not measured the so- called tolerance \nbetween the identified sides of the nozzle holder and the flow cell base, and BD\u2019s counsel acknowledged that \u201cnobody\u201d knows the amount of space between them.\n41  Accordingly, BD\u2019s own expert \nleaves open the possibility that contact between the sides of the nozzle holder and the flow cell base do not restrict t he nozzle to a \ndefined three -dimensional position and rotational orientation.\n42  \nAnd, indeed, Beckman\u2019s expert opined that the nozzle is actually restricted to a defined position by contacts between the cylindrical surface of the nozzle and the V -groove (as well as contact between \nthe top of the nozzle and the cuvette). \nBD\u2019s\n position on this issue can also be rejected for the \nindependent reason that the three surfaces identified by BD do not put any constraints on the nozzle holder in the longitudinal (in/out) direction.\n43  So those surfaces do not hold the nozzle in a defined \nthree-dimensional position.   \nI\nnherent in BD \u2019s position is its apparent contention that the \nclaim requirement that the nozzle be \u201c held in said registered position \n[in a defined three- dimensional position and rotational orientation] \nby contact between . . . hard planar surfaces of [the] nozzle key and [the] cuvette\u201d does not actually mean that the contact between hard \nplanar surfaces of the nozzle key and the cuvette define the three-dimensional position and rotational orientation of the nozzle. Rather, BD appears to argue that the phrase is met as long as there \n40 (D.I. 73 (Second Chalmers Decl.) \u00b6 74; Tr. 29.) \n41 (Tr. 30.)   \n42 (Tr. 29 -33.)    \n43 (Tr. 13-15.)   20 are three planar surfaces that might constrain the free movement of \nthe nozzle holder if it were able  to be jiggled around even if contacts \nwith other components actually define the precise three -dimensional \nposition and rotational orientation of the nozzle.   \nI\nn support of its argument, BD points out that contacts with \nthe claimed planar surfaces canno t be the only things that hold the \nnozzle key in position.  For example, there needs to be something underneath the nozzle key to keep it from falling down.\n44  BD also \nimplies that the claimed surfaces do not need to restrict the nozzle key in the longitudinal direction because the claimed nozzle key needs to be able to be pulled out of the device so that it can be cleaned.\n45   \nBD\u2019s\n briefing did not explicitly say that there was any claim \nconstruction issue about what it means to hold something in a defined three -dimensional position and rotational orientation (nor \ndid it proffer a proposed construction), but its counsel suggested during oral argument that there is a \u201c subsidiary claim construction \nissue \u201d here that might need to be resolved.\n46 \nI\n do not think that BD is likely to succeed on its argument, \nregardless of whether it is viewed as a claim construction argument or an argument about how the accused device operates.\n  Of course, \nthe nozzle key can be removed by pulling it out in the longitudina l \ndirection.  And, of course , more than a top and two side surfaces are \nneeded to physically keep the nozzle key from falling down.  But the \nlanguage of the claim, read in view of the specification, suggests that the claimed planar surface contacts must define the three-dimensional position and rotational orientation of the nozzle.  And, for the reasons already stated, the record does not support a finding that the surfaces that BD identifies on Beckman \u2019s accused device do \nthat.   \nF\nor all of those reasons, I conclude that BD has failed to \ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits on the issue of infringement.  Having so concluded, the Court need not consider the remaining PI factors.  The Court should deny the motion for a \npreliminary injunction.   \n44 (Tr. 33 -34.) \n45 (Tr. 13 -15.) \n46 (Tr. 33.)  21 This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.
