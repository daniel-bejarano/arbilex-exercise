{"case_name": "USA v. Michael Protack", "case_number": "21-42", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "11-14-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, )\nPlaintiff,\nv. Crim. No. 21-42-RGA\nMICHAEL PROTACK,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nDENYING MOTION FOR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE\n\nMichael Protack, an inmate, filed a motion for compassionate release on May 20, 2022.\n(D.I. 53). The Government responded. (D.L. 59). Protack advised he would be filing an\namended motion. (D.I. 61). I appointed counsel. (D.I. 64). On September 15, 2022, counsel\nfiled an emergency motion for compassionate release. (D.I. 65). The Government responded.\n(D.I. 67). Protack replied. (D.1. 68). Protack and the Government submitted additional\ncorrespondence. (D.I. 69, 70, 72, 74, 77).\n\nI sentenced Protack to twelve months in prison. Protack is scheduled for release on\nDecember 20, 2022. He was incarcerated from June 11, 2021, to August 25, 2021, and then\nfrom March 7, 2022, to present. Protack made an administrative request for compassionate\nrelease, which was denied. (D.I. 59-4).\n\nMuch of Protack\u2019s motion involved allegations of inadequate medical care at FCI\nTerminal Island. Without a hearing, it would be hard to conclude that this was true.\n\nBut Protack also alleges various medical conditions that are serious and which might be\n\nexceptional circumstances that would make him eligible for release. To wit, hypertension,\n\nPage | of 4\n\ncoronary artery disease, heart failure, and labile angina. (D.I. 65 at 2). His main complaint is\nthat he does not receive \u201can urgent response to his medical needs by the staff at FCI Terminal\nIsland.\u201d (/d.). He says his \u201cdangerously high blood pressure\u201d goes untreated. (/d. at 5). Two of\nhis conditions (heart failure and severe hypertension) place him at greater risk for becoming\nseverely ill from COVID-19. Cid. at 6).\n\nProtack states that he has \u201cextraordinary and compelling reasons\u201d for compassionate\nrelease. (Id. at 8).\n\nThe Government\u2019s response disputes the criticisms of his care. (D.I. 67). In its earlier\nresponse (D.I. 59), the Government disputed the health conditions are \u201cextraordinary and\ncompelling reasons.\u201d\n\nIt is the inmate\u2019s burden to show that I should grant the compassionate release motion. I\nam not convinced that Protack has shown that the standard of medical care at FCI Terminal\nIsland is deficient. Essentially, I have medical records through the middle to end of May (D.I.\n59-2) with one additional page sent to me in October (D.I. 70 & 71). There is not, realistically,\ntime to develop the record, perhaps with a hearing and/or expert testimony, to determine whether\nhe is getting adequate care, given that he is due to be released in less than six weeks anyway.\n\nThus, I am left with the undisputed assertions that he has various serious medical\nconditions, the disputed assertions about his treatment, and that he is incarcerated. I have been\nprovided with about 240 pages of medical records. (D.I. 59-2). Ireviewed them. I note blood\npressure readings at various times. Most of them predate his hospitalization at Torrance from\n\nabout April 16-22, 2022. The readings before hospitalization were at times what I believe to be\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\ndangerously high. But the last two readings are not life threatening. On May 19, 137/83; on\nApril 22, 126/83.' I am thus unconvinced that Protack\u2019s life is in danger at the present time.\n\nHe has serious medical conditions. I assume for present purposes they could be\nextraordinary and compelling reasons for his release. I nevertheless am not going to grant the\nmotions for compassionate release. The sentencing factors do not support the grant of the\nmotion. What I said at sentencing is still true. Here is an edited version.\n\n[I consider] the nature and circumstances of the offense, the need for the sentence\nimposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and to\nprovide just punishment for the offense.\n\nWhat you did is essentially a campaign of terror. It was a campaign of terror that\nwas done over at least a few months. It was a campaign where you tried to cover your\ntracks. I don't know how many bitter divorce proceedings the [lawyer] victim is involved\nin, but I would have guessed that at some point the victim would report these things to\nlaw enforcement. Even though you would be a prime suspect, the fact of the matter is it\ntook a lot of law enforcement effort to track down that, in fact, these things did originate\nwith you. I'm guessing, though it is never said anywhere, that it included DNA testing on\na postage stamp, but maybe I'm misunderstanding how exactly they tracked it back to\nyou. In any event, it's a very serious offense from the point of view of the time and effort\nyou put into it. It's a very serious offense from the point of view of the victim who has\nsome unknown enemy out there threatening him, and he doesn't know how serious the\nperson is about carrying it out. He doesn't know how capable the person is of carrying it\nout. I don't actually know what his reaction to all of this was, but if he were physically\naffected by it and started buying home security systems and doing other things, that\nwould not surprise me. That would be a rational reaction, at least one of the rational\nreactions to this. It's very serious, even though my own belief is you didn't intend to\nactually kill somebody. That's the reason why the Sentencing Guidelines suggest that you\nshould be incarcerated\u2014it is a serious crime.\n\nI need to consider the need for adequate deterrence to you, and to protect the\npublic from you. I believe you when you say that you've learned a lesson here and won't\nbe doing anything like this again in the future. I feel fairly confident that you mean it, and\nthat this training that you had and all your friends that wrote a letter talking about what\nyou learned in the Marines, which somehow or another seemed to escape you for this\ncrime, will guide your future behavior. I don't think from that point of view that I need to\npunish you more in order to prevent you from doing this again.\n\nI've considered your personal characteristics, and you certainly have done a lot of\ngood in your life. You served your country in a very responsible position as a pilot in the\n\n1 Protack has submitted miscellaneous pages of medical records subsequent to the bulk production at D.I. 59-2. On\nAugust 12, 2022, he had a blood pressure reading of 162/96. (D.I. 74, Ex. A, at 4 of 6). On August 29, 2022, he had\nthree blood pressure readings, at least one of which was extremely high. (/d., at 6 of 6). On October 7, 2022, he had\nblood pressure readings that were quite high. (D.L 74, Ex. B, at 4 of 6).\n\nPage 3 of 4\nMarines. You had a good family life and raised two children, presumably with your wife,\nand the children turned out to be productive citizens. The time in particular that you spent\nwith the Scouts is a good public service to youth. You continued to donate that time even\nwhen your sons were no longer involved. So, that's a very positive thing. You've\nparticipated in the public life of the country by being involved in political activities.\nThat's a positive thing. You have come across a lot of people between the Air Force, the\nScouts and the training activities who think very highly of you. There was one [long]\nletter that I read describing many positive things about you, but the sentence that I\nunderlined because it stood out to me was, \u201cWhen I heard about what he was accused of,\nI was shocked. The allegations were so against the person I knew and love that they were\nunbelievable.\" It must have come as a shock to a lot of the people who wrote the letters. I\ngather some of them haven't really heard entirely what it is you did do. But, in any event,\nthe point is that it is out of character.\n\nThere is some underlying issue, I think, that caused you to deviate so much not\nonly from what you have been, but also from what's expected of a citizen. Your personal\ncharacteristics weigh in your favor, too. But it's hard to get past the actual nature of the\ncrime, and so, therefore, it's my opinion that in order to take into account the nature and\ncircumstances of the offense, and to promote respect for the law, and to provide a just\npunishment for the offense that I am going to sentence you within the guidelines. I'd\nprobably sentence you to more, but for the good things in your past.\n\nI continue to believe that the reasons that I analyzed at sentencing required a twelve-\nmonth sentence to meet the goals of sentencing, and that, because of them, Protack\u2019s health\nissues do not rise to the level of extraordinary and compelling circumstances justifying a\nreduction in sentence.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED this 14\" day of November 2022. :\n\nUnited States\n\nPage 4 of 4\n"}
