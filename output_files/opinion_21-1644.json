DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n Before the Court i s the motion (D.I . 13) of Defendant s United States Sugar Corporation \n(\u201cU.S. Sugar\u201d), United Sugars Corporation (\u201cUnited Sugars\u201d), Imperial Sugar Company \n(\u201cImperial  Sugar \u201d) and Louis Dreyfus Comp any LLC (\u201cLouis Dreyfus\u201d ) (collectively, \n\u201cDefendant s\u201d) to tran sfer this case to  the Southern Distric t of Georgia  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1404(a).  For the reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES Defendant s\u2019 motion.1 \nI. BACKGROUND \nU.S. Sugar is a Delaware co rporation with its princ ipal place of business in Florida.  \n(D.I. 14 at 3; see also D.I. 18 \u00b6 2).  U .S. Sugar processes sugarcane grown by its farmers and sells \nthat refined sugar through a member -owned agricultural cooperative,  United Sugars .  (D.I. 18 \u00b6  2; \nsee also  D.I. 16 \u00b6  2).  United Sugars is  incorporated in Minnesota and maint ains its principal place \nof business in Minnesota.  (D.I. 1 6 \u00b6 3).  The sugar processed by U.S. Sugar and sold through \nUnited Sugars r eaches many states  on the East Coast ,2 including Delaware.  ( D.I. 1  \u00b6\u00b6 3 & 31; see \nalso D.I. 16 \u00b6 4).   \nOne of United Suga rs\u2019s direct competito rs is Imperial Sugar, a Texas company with offices \nin Port Wentworth, Georgia and Sugar Land, Texas.  (D.I. 17 \u00b6  3; see also  D.I. 1 \u00b6  11 (Imperial \nSugar\u2019s h eadquarters  in Sugar Land, Texas)  & \u00b6\u00b6  40-47 (United Sugar s and Imperial Sugar direct \ncompetitors)) .  Instead of growing its own sugarcane, Imperial Sugar receives  imported raw sugar \n \n1  Defendants\u2019 motion also requested that tr ial be expedited and hel d sometime in April 2022 \nin the event the Court decline s to transfer the cas e to the Southern District of Georgia.  (See \nD.I. 13; see also  D.I. 14 at 16).  The Court has already set a trial date in that timeframe.  \n(See D.I. 38 at 13:15- 14:7; see also  D.I. 21). \n2  The Government refers to the geographic area a t issue in this lawsu it as the \u201cSoutheastern \nUnited States,\u201d which apparently includes Delaware based on the U.S. Census definition \nof \u201cSouth Atlantic\u201d states.  ( See, e.g., D.I.  1 \u00b6\u00b6 3 & 26; see also  D.I. 30 at 1 & 1 n.1).  The \ncategorizat ion of Delaware as a \u201csouthern\u201d state seems counterintuitive and, as such, the \nCourt declines to use Plaintiff\u2019s terminology.  2 and processes the sugar  in its Port Wentworth sugar refinery.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3 & 5).   The Port Wentwort h \nrefinery is the only sugar refinery that Imperial Sug ar owns.  ( Id. \u00b6 3).  The sugar processed and \nsold by Imperial Sugar reaches many states  on the East Coast , including Delaware .  (D.I. 1 \u00b6 \u00b6 3 & \n31; see also  D.I. 17 \u00b6  6).  Imper ial Sugar is wholly owne d by Louis Dreyfus, a  Delaware limited  \nliability compan y.3  (D.I. 17 \u00b6 7).   \nOn March 24, 2021, U.S. Sugar and Louis Dreyfus entered into an Asset Purchase \nAgreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) , whereby U.S. Sugar would acquire all of Imperia l Sugar\u2019s assets \n\u2013 inclu ding the Port Wentworth facility \u2013 for $315 million.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6  13; see also  D.I. 33, Ex. 1 \n(Asset Purchase Agreement)).   Following execution of the Agreement, U.S. Sugar , Imperial Sugar  \nand Louis Dreyfus also entered into \u201ca side l etter agreement\u201d with Un ited Sugar s, which apparently \nprovided that United  Suga rs would comply with certain obligations set forth in the Agreeme nt.  \n(D.I. 1 \u00b6  13).  United Sugar s then entered into an agreement with its four members (including U.S. \nSugar), which provided that Unit ed Sugar s would market all of the suga r produced by Imperial \nSugar if the ac quisition  is allowed to proceed.  ( Id.).  U.S. Sugar\u2019s acquisition of Imperial Sugar \nwould apparently leave only two major sugar producers  \u2013 United  Sugars  and Domino \u2013  in control \nof roughly 75% of the sugar sales in th e Southeastern United States .  (D.I. 1  \u00b6 4).  Under the Asset \nPurchase Agreement, t he Outside Date is September 24, 2022 but the parties can mutually agree \nto extend this date .  (See D.I. 15 \u00b6  11; see also  D.I. 33, Ex. 1 \u00a7 10.1(b)).  \nOn November 23, 2021, t he United States  of America ( \u201cPlaintif f\u201d or \u201cthe Government\u201d)  \ninitiated  this antitrust action under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, ultimately seeking to prevent U.S. \nSugar from acquiring Imperial  Sugar .  (See generally D.I. 1).   On December 3, 2021, Defenda nts \n \n3  Louis Dreyfus Company is owned by Louis Dreyfus Company B.V., a foreign company \nheadquar tered in the Netherlands.  (D.I. 17 \u00b6  7).   3 filed a motio n to transfe r this ac tion to the Southern District of Georgia, where Imperial Sugar \u2019s \nPort Wentworth refinery (i.e., the main target asset) is located .  (See D.I. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 & 18).  \nThe Governm ent opposes transferring this action.  (See D.I. 30, 32 & 33).  Expedited br iefing on \nDefendants \u2019 motion was complete d on December 17 , 2021.  ( See D.I. 37).    \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n District courts have the authority to transfer venue \u201c[f] or the convenience of pa rties and \nwitnesses, in the interest o f justice, . . . to any other district  or division where it might have been \nbrought.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).  \u201cA plaintiff, as the injured  party, generally ha[s] been \u2018accorded \n[the] privilege of  bringing an action wher e he chooses.\u2019\u201d  Helicos Biosciences C orp. v. Illumina, \nInc., 858 F. Supp. 2d 367, 371 (D. Del. 2012) (quoting Norwood v. Kirkpatrick , 349 U.S. 29, 31 \n(1955)).  Plaintiff\u2019s ch oice of location in bringing the action \u201cshould not be li ghtly disturbed.\u201d  \nJumar a v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995).    \nIn determining whether an action should be transferred under \u00a7 1404(a), t he Third Circuit \nhas recognized  that: \ncourts have not limited their consideration to the three enumerated \nfactors in \u00a7  1404(a) (convenience of parties, convenie nce of \nwitnesses,  or interests of just ice), and, indeed, commentators have \ncalled on the courts to \u201cconsider all relevant factors to determine \nwhether on balance the litigation would more conveniently proceed and the i nterests of justice be better served b y trans fer to a d ifferent \nforum.\u201d  \n \nJumara, 55 F.3d at 879 (citation omitted).  The Jumara court went on to describe twelve \u201cprivate \nand public interests protected by the language of \u00a7 1404(a).\u201d  Id.  The private intere sts include:  \nplaintiff\u2019s forum prefere nce as manifested  in the original choi ce; the \ndefendant\u2019s preference; whether the claim arose elsewhere; the convenience of the parties as indicated by their relative physical and financial cond ition; the convenience o f the witnesses \u2013 but only to \nthe extent that  the witne sses may actually be unavailable for trial in \none of the fora; and the location of books and records (similarly 4 limited to the extent that the files could not be produced in the  \nalternative forum).  \n \nId. at 879 (citations omitted).  The public interests include:  \n \nthe enforceab ility of the judgment; practical considerations that \ncould make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive; the relative administrative difficulty in the two fora resulting from c ourt \ncongestion; the local interest in  decidi ng local c ontroversies at \nhome;  the public policies of the fora; and the familiarity of the trial \njudge with the applicable state law in diversity cases.  \n Id. at 879- 80.  \n The party seeki ng transfer bears the bu rden \u201cto establish that a balancing of  proper  interests  \nweigh[s] in favor of  transfer.\u201d  Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 25 (3d Cir. 1970).  C ourts \nhave \u201cbroad discretion to determine, on an individualized, case -by-case basis, whether \nconvenience  and fairness considerations weigh in favor of transfer .\u201d  Jumara, 55 F.3d a t 883.  T he \nThird Circuit has held, however,  that \u201cunless the balance of convenience of the parties is strongly \nin favor of [the] defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s  choice of forum should prevail.\u201d  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25.   \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nAs an ini tial matter, the Cour t addresses the threshold inquiry under \u00a7 1404(a) \u2013 i.e., \nwhether this action might  have originally been brought in the transferee district.  Defendant s argue \nthat this action coul d have originally be brought in the So uthern District o f Georgia , which i s where \nthe target  company\u2019s only sugar refinery  is located .  (D.I. 14 at 6 ).  The Government  does not \ndispute that  the case could have originally been brought  in that district.  ( Com pare D.I. 14 at 6 n.2 \n(Defendants noti ng that the Gover nment was still mulling the threshold issue), with  D.I. 30 (the \nGovernment\u2019s brief , which is silent on the threshold issue)).  Indeed, the Government\u2019 s opposition \nis focused on the private and public i nterest factors under Jumara.  Thus, i n the Court\u2019s vie w, the \nthreshold inquiry under \u00a7 1404(a) is satisfied  and the only issue before the Court is whether to 5 exercise its discretion under \u00a7 1404(a) to transfer the case to the Southern District of Georgia .  The \nCourt addresses the Jumara facto rs in turn below.  \n1. Plaintiff \u2019s Forum P reference  \nThis factor weighs against trans fer.  \u201cIt is black letter law that a plaintiff\u2019s choice of a \nproper forum is a paramount consideration in any deter mination of a transfer r equest\u201d \u2013 one that \n\u201cshould not be lightly disturbed.\u201d  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25 (internal quotations and citation omitt ed).  \n\u201cAssuming jurisdiction and proper venue, weight is given to plaintiff\u2019s choice because it is \nplaintiff\u2019s choi ce and a strong showing under the statutory criteria in favor of another forum is \nthen required as a  prerequisite to transfer.\u201d4  Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Giant Food, Inc., \n392 F.  Supp. 761, 763 n.4 (D. Del. 1975).  \nDefendant s recognize  that the Government \u2019s choice to litigate in  Delaware w eighs against \ntransfer.  (D .I. 14 at 13).  D efendant s nevertheles s argue that this choice shoul d be given \u201clittle \ndeference\u201d because Delaware is \u201ca forum far from the center of the alleged \u2018acute harm.\u2019\u201d  (Id.).  \nIn Defen dants\u2019 view, the relevan t forum is the Southern District of Ge orgia, which is w here \nImperial Sugar\u2019s  main asset is located and a v enue much closer to the \u201cfocus\u201d of this case.  ( See \nid. at 15).  According to Defendants , Delaware has \u201cno meaningful ties\u201d to  the controversy at issue  \nhere and, as such, the Government\u2019s  preferred  forum i s entitled to less we ight than it may otherwise \nbe afforded.  (See id. at 13 -15; see D.I. 37 at 1).  In support of their arguments, Defendants \nprimarily rely on a case from the District of Columbia, wh ich states that a plaintiff\u2019s choice o f \nforum should be  given less deference  if the forum has an insufficient nexus to the case.  See  FTC \nv. Illumina, Inc., No. 21 -873 (RC), 2021 WL 1546542, at *6 (D.D.C. Apr. 20, 2021) .   \n \n4  No Defen dant has disputed tha t venue is proper here or that this Court may exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over all Defendants. 6 The Gover nment argues  that its ch oice of forum is  \u201cparamount,\u201d particul arly in antitrust \ncases  where there is  a specific venue statute  (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 22) that is designed to make  it easier for \nthe Government (and others) to litigate these types of disputes .  (See D.I. 30 at 6- 9).  That is, a s \nlong as its  choice of venue is \u201clegitimate and ratio nal,\u201d the choice shou ld be afforded great \ndeference.  ( Id. at 6-7).  And here, the decision to file this case in Delaware is purportedly \nlegitimate and rational because the prop osed acquisition is betw een two Delaware companies and \ngoverne d by an Asset Pur chase Agreement that requires any disputes relating to the acquisition be \nlitigated in Delaware.  (Id. at 7; see also  D.I. 33, Ex. 1 \u00a7 12.20).  In the Government\u2019s view, these \nfacts undercut any argume nt by Defendants that Delaware has no connection to thi s dispute (or \nthat Delaware is an inconvenient forum to litigate this dispute ).  (D.I. 30 at 7).  Additionally, the \nGovernment argues that the geographic area relevant to the pr esent dispute includes D elaware  \nbecause the pr oposed acquisiti on would result i n United Sugar s contr olling an \u201coverwhelming \npercentage\u201d of sugar sales in Delaware.  ( Id. at 8).  \nThe Court agrees that the Government\u2019s  choice of forum should be given great deference.  \nSection 12 of t he Clayton Act provides  that \u201c[a] ny suit, action, or p roceeding under the a ntitrust \nlaws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an \ninhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be  found or transacts busi ness . . . .\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 22.  This v enue provision wa s enacted to afford s ome flexibility in selecting a venue for  those \nattempting  to enforce antitrust laws.   See United States v. Nat\u2019l City Lines , 334 U.S. 573, 586 -87 \n(1948) .  In fact, be cause of this provision, \u201cs ome courts have found tha t the United States\u2019 choice \nof forum i n antitrust cases should receive heightened respect.\u201d  United States v. Energy Sols., Inc., \nNo. 16- 1056- GMS, 2016 WL 7387069, at *2 (D. Del. Dec. 21, 2016).   7 Although Defendants a rgue that the Government\u2019s choice  of forum  should be af forded \nminimal weight because Delaware is not particularly connected to the present dispute, the Court \nfinds there are  sound reasons for the Government\u2019s choice.  First, the propos ed acquisition of \nImperial Sugar by U.S. Sugar is a transac tion between two companies incorporate d in Delaware \u2013 \nU.S. Sugar and Louis Dreyfus.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 14 at 4; D .I. 30 at 3- 4).5  The Court also finds it \nimportant  that U.S. Sugar and Louis Drey fus agreed to litigate a ny disputes relating to the Asset \nPurchase Agreement in  Delaware.  (D.I. 33,  Ex. 1 \u00a7  12.20).  Although this does not mean that they \nagreed to litigate antitrust disputes brought by the Government here as well , the agreement does \nlend reason to the Governme nt\u2019s choice of Delaware as its preferr ed forum .  Indeed, these facts  \nare ver y similar to  those in United States v. Energy Solutions, Inc., where the G overnment\u2019s choice \nof Delaware was entitled to deference:   \nThe District of Delawar e does have an interest i n the subject matter \nand the parties because the Defen dants chose to incorporate here and \nselected this forum as the District to litigate disputes resulting from \ntheir merger agreement.  Even though that forum selection clause does not apply to the present  action brought by the Government, it  \nstill ties the p arties to this District.  \n2016 WL 7387069, at *2 (internal citations omitted) . \nAdditionally, this  Court believes that the Government has a furt her basis for this forum \nbecause th e proposed acquisition w ill allegedly  impact  sugar sales (and competition) here  in \nDelaware.   (See D.I. 30 at 8- 9).  Indeed, the Government asserts that , because United Sugars and \nImperial Sugars are the two largest sugar sellers in Delaware, the proposed acquisition w ould result  \nin United Sugars controlling most sugar sales in Delaw are if allowed to proceed.  ( Id. at 8).   Finally, \n \n5  Attempting to downplay this critical fact, Defendants p oint to the presence of t wo non-\nDelaware entities \u2013 Imperial S ugar and United S ugars \u2013 as additional  Defendants in this \ncase.  ( See D.I. 14 at 14 -15; see also  D.I. 37 at 2).  The Court does not believe that the \npresence of these non- Delaware entities automatically lessens the def erence that should be \nafforded to the Government\u2019s choi ce of forum.   8 the Government\u2019s Antitrust Division is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and D elaware is \napparently the closest forum where ve nue and personal jurisdi ction are proper for all Defendants \n\u2013 an assertion that  Defendants do not di spute.  ( Id. at 9).  \nIn sum, although Defendants contend that Delaware \u201chas no meaningful ties to the \ncontroversy,\u201d the Court has found several sound reasons  for the Government to c hoose Delaware \nas the forum to litigate this dispute.  This Court therefore does not see a disti nction here that \njustifies affording less weight to the Government \u2019s choice of forum.  The Government \u2019s choice to \nlitigate in Delaware r emains entitled to param ount consideration.6 \n2. Defendants \u2019 Forum  Preference  \nThis factor favors transfer.  Defendant s\u2019 interest in having this case transferred to the \nSouthern District of Georgia  is apparent .     \n3. Whether the C laims A rose E lsewhere  \nThis factor  is neutral.  As to wher e the claim(s) arose, both sides gener ally agree that t he \nCourt should look to \u201cwhere the corporate decisions underlying th[e] claims were made.\u201d  F.T.C. \nv. Graco Inc., No. 11- 02239 RLW, 2012 WL 3584683, at *5 (D.D.C. Jan. 26, 2012) ; see also \nEnergy Sols., 2016 WL 7387069, at *4.   That is, in the context of this proposed acquisiti on, the \nCourt should at least evaluate where the acquisition was negotiated, drafted and  executed.   See \nEnergy Sols., 2016 WL 7387069, at *4.  The Court may also take into account w here Defendants\u2019 \nheadquarters are loc ated.  See Graco Inc., 2012 WL 3584683, at *5. \n \n6  This Court generally agrees with t he reasoning set forth in Burroughs Wellcome , where \nJudge Stapleton found that the Third Circuit\u2019s rule that a plaintiff\u2019s ch oice is of paramount \nconsideration is \u201c an across -the-board rul e favoring plaint iff\u2019s choice of forum .\u201d  \n392 F.  Supp. at 762- 63; see also  VLSI Tech. LLC v. Intel Corp., No. 18- 966-CFC, 2018 \nWL 5342650, at *4 (D. Del. Oct. 29, 2018) . 9 Defendant s argue  that this factor weighs in favor of transfer because (1) none of the \nnegotiations , discussions or meetings  relating to the propose d acquisition took place  in Delaware \nand (2) the negotiations involve d site vis its and plant tours of the Imperial Sugar refinery  in Port \nWentworth, Georgia .  (D.I. 14 at 8).  Moreover, in Defendants\u2019 view, that the main asset to be \nacquired  in the transaction is located in Port W entworth, along with a  purportedly key due \ndiligence w itness for Imperial  Sugar, further suggest that the claim  arose in the Southern District \nof Georgia.  ( Id.).  The Government argues that Defendants have failed to offer any evid ence that \nthe proposed a cquisition was actually negotiated in Georgia.  (D.I. 30 at 10).  Instead, the current \nrecord suggests that negotiations occurred mainly in Florida and New York City.  ( Id. (citing \nDefendants\u2019 declarations and internal documents)).  The Government also not es that none of the \nDefendants have co rporate headquart ers located in Georgi a and only one person involved in the \ndeal is located there.   (Id.).  And, a s the Government again points out, this all stands in contrast to  \nthe fact that the  proposed transaction is between two Delaware companies and  governed by a \ncontract that makes Del aware the exclusive forum to litigate any disputes over the transaction.  \n(Id.). \nThe Court cannot conclude the claim here arose in the Southern District of Georgia.  The \nevidence s uggests that negotiations primarily oc curred in Florida  and New York \u2013 not G eorgia or \nDelaware \u2013 and t here is no evidence indicating where the agreement was drafted or executed .  \nSimilarly, no Defendant maintains its principal place  of business in Georgia ( or Delaware).  Based \non the current r ecord, the Court concludes that this f actor is largely neutral.  See Energy Sols., \n2016 WL 7387069, at *4 (finding this factor largely neutral where record did not \u201cdefinitively \nindicate that ne gotiations occurred in t he [transferee district]\u201d but also \u201cd[ id] not indicate where a \nmajority of the negotiations took place\u201d) .  10 4. Convenience of the P arties as Indicated by T heir R elative Physical \nand F inancial C ondition       \nThis factor is neutral.  Det ermining convenience of t he parties requires the Court to \nconsider:  (1) the pa rties\u2019 physical location; (2) the associated logistical and operational costs to \nthe parties in traveling to Delaware \u2013 as opposed to the proposed transferee district \u2013 for litigation \npurposes; and (3)  the relative ability of each party to  bear these costs  in light of its size  and financial \nwherewithal.  See MEC Resources, LLC  v. Apple, Inc., 269 F. Supp. 3d 218, 225 (D. Del.  2017) \n(citing Memory Integrity, LLC v. Intel Corp., No . 13- 1804 (GMS), 2015 WL  632026, at *4 \n(D. Del. Feb. 13, 2015)  (internal quotat ions omitted)).

Additionally, \u201ccritical employee witnesses \u201d for Imperial \nSugar are purportedly l ocated in the Southern D istrict of Georgia and \u201ccritical emplo yee \nwitnesses\u201d fo r U.S. Sugar are loca ted in Florida.  ( Id.).  As for United Sugars and Louis Dreyfus, \nDefendants argue that they will need to travel regardless of forum but that their employees  travel 11 to Georgia (and F lorida) regularly.  ( Id.; see also  D.I. 17 \u00b6 11; D.I. 16 \u00b6 5).  The Governm ent \nresponds that United Sugars and Louis Dreyfus have headquarters closer to Delaware than \nGeorgia.  (D.I. 30 at 12 (Louis Dreyfus headquartered in Connect icut and United Sugars \nheadquartered in Minnesota)).  Moreover , in the Governme nt\u2019s view, Louis Drey fus and U.S. \nSugar  face a particularly \u201cuphill climb\u201d in showing that Delaware is inconvenient because they \nchose to incorporate in Delaware (and agreed to litigate disputes about t he transaction here).  \n(D.I.  30 at 11).  Additionally, the Government asser ts that all Defendants are large corporations \nwith national ( or international) presences , and they all have \u201cmore than adequate\u201d resources to \nlitigate in th is District.7  (Id. at 12).  And as for Imperial Sugar, the Government argues t hat its \noperations in Georgia should not be dispositive of this factor when the other three Defendants (and \nPlaintiff) have no such operations there.  ( Id.).  \nOn this factor, t he Court begins its analys is with U.S. Sugar and Louis Dreyfus.  Given that \nU.S. Sugar and Louis Dreyfus  are incorporated in Delaware, they  must demonstrate that litigating \nhere \u201cwould impose a unique or unusual burden on [ their] operations.\u201d  Graphics Pro ps. Holdings , \n964 F. Supp. 2d at 325.  Defendants fail in this regard.  There is  no articulation or s pecific showing \nof why litigating here would impose a unique or unusual hardship on U.S. Sugar or Louis Dreyfus  \n(e.g., diverting resources, etc.) .  Defendan ts simply argue that Geo rgia is  more convenient because \nit is closer to U.S. Sugar\u2019s headquarters  (and employees ).  Yet the decision by U.S. Sugar and \nLouis Dreyfus to incorporate in Delaware and their agreement  to litigate disputes relating to \nproposed ac quisition  here strongly suggest that this District is not an inconvenient forum .  See \nEnergy Sols., 2016 WL 7387069, at *4 (\u201c Both Defendants are incorporated in Delaware and the \nPurchase Agreement reached between the two parties designates Delaware as the venue where any \n \n7  Defendants do not dis pute this characterizati on. 12 disputes  arising out of the agreement should be litigated.  . . . [T]he parties\u2019 willingness to travel to \nand litigate in Delaware, made apparent by the forum selection clause, undermines any argument \nDefendants co uld make that Delaware is an inconvenient forum .\u201d (citations omitted) ). \nAs for the two De fendants not incorporated in Delaware,  the Court is unpersuaded that the \nSouthern District of Georgia is any more convenient than this District for United Sugar s.  Uni ted \nSugars is a Minnesota c ompany with its headquar ters in Minnesota, which is closer to Delaware \nthan Geo rgia.8  And as for Im perial Sugar, it does appear that Georgia may be more convenient \ngiven that its sugar refinery (and the main target asset ) is located there , along with seve ral hundred \nImperial Sug ar employees.  That being said, that the proposed trans feree fo rum may be mo re \nconvenient for one out of a number of  Defendants  does not mean  that this factor favors transfer , \nparticularly where all Defendants  have more than adequat e financial resources to  litigate in either \nforum.   This is tr ue for the Government as well \u2013 although Delaware is closer to Washington, D.C. \nthan the Southern District of Georgia , the Government is likewise equipped with vast resources \nand could readily litigate in either forum.   Thus, the Court ultimately finds  that litigating in \nDelaware is roughly as  convenient as litigating Georgia, and this factor is neutral.      \n5. Convenience of the W itnesses  \nThis factor is neutral .  This factor carries weight \u201conly to the extent that the witnesses may \nactually be unavailable for  trial in one of the fora.\u201d  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879; see also VLSI , 2018 \nWL 5342650, at *7 (citing Smart Audio, 910 F. Supp. 2d at 732 (noting that this fac tor applies \nonly insofar as \u201ca witness  actually will refuse to  testify absent a subpoena\u201d)).  \u201c[W]it nesses who \nare em ployed by a party car ry no weight\u201d because \u201ceach party is able, indeed, obligated to procure \n \n8  In fact, although no Defendant maintains headqua rters in Delaware, th e same is true in \nGeorgia as well \u2013 no Defendant has a principal place of business in Georgia either.  13 the attendance of its own employees for trial.\u201d  Affymetrix, Inc. v. Synteni, Inc., 28 F. Supp. 2d \n192, 203 ( D. Del. 1998).  \u201c[T]he Court should be particularly co ncerned not to counte nance undue \ninconvenience to third- party witnesses[] who have no direct connection to the litigation.\u201d  \nIntellectual V entures I , 842 F. Supp. 2d at  757.   \nDefendant s assert that th is factor \u201cstrongly supports transfer\u201d  because the most  relevant \nnon-party w itnesses will likely be customers in Georgia and its bordering states.  (D.I. 14 at 9- 10).  \nDefendants also argue that, in response to the Government\u2019s clai m that competition in Ge orgia \nwill be diminished if the acquis ition is allowed t o proceed, evidence from other sugar companies \nin the area will be \u201c a central issue at trial .\u201d  (Id. at 10).  After identifying a handful of such sugar \ncompanies, Defendants as sert that \u201cit will be fa r easier for witnesses from these comp anies to \ntestify at trial in Georgia than to testify in Delaware.\u201d   (Id.).  The Government responds that t his \nfactor only carries weight when third -party witnesses may actually be unavailable in  one of the \nfora but, he re, the Clayton Act ensures that such witnesses will ge nerally be available in both.  \n(D.I. 30 at 13).  That is, the Clayton Act explicitly  provides  that trial subpoenas may be served in \nany judicial district.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 23 (\u201cIn any suit, action, or proceeding brought by or on \nbehalf of the United States  subpoenas for witnes ses who are required to attend a court of the United \nStates in any judicial district in any case, civil or criminal, arising under the antitrust laws may ru n \ninto any other distric t . . . .\u201d).  In the Government\u2019s view , then, any third- party witnesses will  \n\u201clikely be as available for trial in Delaware as they are in Georgia.\u201d  (D.I. 30 at 13).    \nNo party has  identified any witness who would be unavailable for  trial in Delaware, which \nis the main consideration under this  Jumara factor.  See Jumara, 55 F.3d a t 879.  As to the third -\nparty witnesses , it is generally true that the Clayton Act provides for nationwide service of trial \nsubpoenas , but it is still impor tant to consider the convenience of trial in Delaware versus G eorgia 14 for third -party witnesses.   Def endants have identified a number of competitor sugar companies  \nwho may be called upon to offer testimony at trial, but Defendants have made no real showing that \nGeorgia is more convenient than Delaware for any of them ( apart from attor ney argument ).  \nSimilarly, the Government asserts that customers in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia , and West \nVirginia could also be relevant witnesses at trial  and that Delaware wo uld be more convenient than \nGeorgia , but this is also largely based on attorney argument .  (D.I. 30 at 14).  Ultimately, the Court \nis left with an argument by Defendants that Georgia would be a more convenient forum for \npotential third -party sugar companie s, alongside an argument  by the Government that Delaware \nwould be a more conven ient forum  for potent ial customer witnesses.  On the state of the  current \nrecord, the Court cannot conclude that one forum  is any more convenient than the other under this \nfacto r.  Therefore, t his fac tor is neutral.  \n6. Location of B ooks and R ecords  \nThis facto r slightly favors tra nsfer.  Jumara instructs the Court to give weight to the \nlocation of books and records necessary to the case only \u201cto the extent that the files [and other evidence] could not be pr oduced in the alternative forum.\u201d  Jum ara, 55 F.3d at 879.  Defendants  \nargue  that none of their  relevant books and records are located in Delaware  and are instead \n\u201cprimarily located in Georgia, Florida, and Texas .\u201d  (D.I. 14 at 11).  Defendant s also asser t that \nthe Southern District of Georgia  is more convenie nt because this litig ation will foc us in part on \n\u201cU.S. Sugar\u2019s strategic goals for the acquisition, which include improving the capacity, efficiency, and operations\u201d of Imperial  Sugar\u2019s refinery.  ( Id.).  In Defendants\u2019 view, site visit(s)  to that facility  \nmay be necessary for  expert witnes ses and \u201cperhaps even the Court.\u201d  ( Id.).  Therefore, the \nSouthern District of Georgia is purportedly more convenient.  T he Government  argues that this \nfactor is neu tral, arguing that the state of technol ogy today minimiz es any burden with pr oducing 15 documents and further arguing that \u201ccritical evidence\u201d is kept closer to Delaware than Georgia.  \n(D.I. 30 at 15).   Additionally, the Government argues that it should not m atter that the Imperial \nSugar refinery is located in the  Southern District of  Georgia because \u201cno court has credited an \nefficiencies defense in an antitrust merger case, much less approved an anticompetitive merger on the basis of such a defense.\u201d  ( Id.).    \nThe Third Circuit has instructed tha t the relevant co nsideration here is w hether the evidence \ncould not be produced in the competing fora.  See  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879.  Defendants have largely \nfailed to demonstrate that some evide nce could not be produc ed here.   For documents, many of \nwhich have already been produced to the Gove rnment and w ith the state of technology in litigation \ntoday and the ease with which documenta ry evidence can be produced electronically, the Court \nfinds tha t this factor  should be  afforded minimal weight.  See, e.g. , Blackbird Tech LLC  v. E.L.F. \nBeauty, Inc. , No. 19- 1150- CFC, 2020 WL 2113528, at *4 (D. Del. May 4, 2020) ; Intellectual \nVentures I , 842 F. Supp. 2d at  759.  That being said, there are apparently s ome documents located \nin Georgia.  (D.I. 14 at 11; see also  D.I. 17 \u00b6  12).  And as for the  Imperial Sugar facility  in Port \nWentworth , although it is true that it is located in the Southern District of Georgia, the Court has \nnot been persuaded that the buil ding itself constitutes  any particularly relevant evidence.\n9  \nTherefore, this f actor weighs in favor  of transfer, but only slightly.    \n7. Enforc eability of the J udgment  \nThis factor is neutral as judgments from this D istrict and the Southern District of Georgia  \nwould be equally enf orceable.  \n  \n \n9  The Court certainly does not believe a site visit i s required in this case ( i.e., a site vis it by \nthe trial court).  16 8. Practical C onsiderations  \nThis factor is neut ral.  The Court must consider \u201cpractical considerations that could make \nthe trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive.\u201d  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879.  Defendants do not address \nthis fa ctor, and the Government  argues that this factor weighs agai nst transfer.  ( See D.I. 30 at 1 5-\n17).  In the Government\u2019s view, litigating this case in Delaware imposes no significant burden on \nDefendants .  (See id. at 16  (\u201cU.S. Sugar and Louis Dreyfus are i ncorporated in Delaware, United \nand Imperial are the largest s ellers of sugar t o customers in Delaware, and all Defendants have \naccess to ample financial resources .\u201d)).  Litigating this case in the Southern District of Georgia, \nhowever, apparently imposes a more significant fina ncial burden on the Government  (located  in \nD.C.) , United Sugars and Louis Dre yfus (located closer to Wilmington than Savannah) , as well as \non third parties .  (Id. at 16 -17).  The Government also  again  reiterates the forum -selection clause \ngoverning the Ass et Purchase Agreement, which obligates U.S. Sugar and Louis Dreyfus to litiga te \ntheir disputes over the proposed acquisition here in Delaware.  ( Id. at 16).  In the Court\u2019s view, \nthese concerns  \u201chave been raised, in the same way, as to other Jumara factors , and so the Court \nwill not \u2018double -count\u2019 them here.\u201d  Elm 3DS Innovations L LC v. SK Hynix, Inc., No. 14 -1432 \n(LPS) (CJB), 2015 WL 4967139, at *11 (D. Del. Aug. 20, 2015).  Therefore, because  there is no \nbroader public benefit to this case proceeding in t his Court versus the Southern District of Georgia  \n(or vi ce versa) , this facto r is neutral.  See  W.R. Berkley Corp. v. Niemela , No. 17- 32 (GMS), 2017 \nWL 4081871, at *4 (D. Del. Sept. 15, 2017) ( finding factor to be neutral when \u201cneither party \naddresse[d] th e broader public costs of proceeding in one district or the other\u201d).   \n9. Relati ve A dministrative D ifficulty D ue to C ourt Congestion \nThis factor  is neutral .  Although there may be general differences  between the District of \nDelaware and  the Southern District o f Georgia in the median length of time  between filing a nd 17 trial (or between filing and disposition)  for civil cases,10 any such differences are rendered moot \nby this Court already having set a side time for  trial in April 2022.11  (D.I. 38 at 13:15- 14:7) .  In \nfact, t here is a trial date certain and soon in this D istrict, whereas it is unknown when trial would \noccur if this case were transferred to the Southern District of Georgia.  In the Court\u2019s view, this \nfactor is neutral .  (That tri al has already been set  here may even weigh agai nst transfer , particularly \nbecause it is unknown whe n the Southern District of Georgia could schedule trial ). \n10. Local Interest in D eciding L ocal C ontroversies at Home \nThis factor is neutral.  Defendant s argue that this factor fa vors transfer because \u201c[t]he \nSouthern District of Georg ia has a strong inter est in overseeing a case that arises in that District \nand that will allegedly most directly affect that District, state, and surrounding area .\u201d  (D.I. 14 at  \n11).  In particular, Def endants emphasize that there are roughly 400 employees  who work at the \nImpe rial Sugar refinery in Port Wentworth  who allegedly  will be directly affected by the proposed \nacquisition and its attendant objectives .  (Id.).  Defendant s also contend that a Geor gia court would \nbe \u201cin the best positi on\u201d to decide the  rights and interests  of Georgia sugar customers  (i.e., those \ncustomers that the Government contends will face particularly acute harm from the proposed \nacquisition) .  (Id. at 12).  In response, the Go vernm ent argues that  this factor is ne utral because the \ninterests implicated  by this case are not local \u2013 to Georgia or elsewhere.  (D.I. 30 at 17- 18).  Instead, \n \n10  The Court t akes judicial notice of the most recent Judicial Caseload Profiles , as of \nMarch  31, 2021, which indicate that, in the District of Delaware, the median length of time \nbetween fil ing and trial for civil c ases is 28.7 months and the median le ngth of time betw een \nfiling and dispos ition in civil cases is 7.3 months.  In the Southern District of Georgia, the \nmedian length of time in civil cases between filing and disposition is 8.9 months, and there \nis no dat a available for t he median length of t ime between filin g and trial.  The Mar ch 2021 \nstatistics for the District Courts of the United States can be found at: https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/data_tables/fcms_na_distprofile0331.2021.pdf . \n11  For s imilar  reasons, a ny differences in the  number of pending cases per judgeship  between \nthe two Districts have no bearing on this factor.  18 the proposed acquisition would purportedly diminish competition betwee n sugar producers \nthroughout many states on the East Coast  (including Delaware ), resulting in higher  prices and \nlesser quality sugar .  (Id. at 18).  Additionally, the Government points out  that of the four \nDefendants, only Imperial Sugar has a facility in Georgia  \u2013 but is neverth eless headquartered in \nTexas.  ( Id.).  The remaining co mpanies  have  national  and international presence s.  (Id.). \nThe Court finds  that this factor is neutral.  Although the proposed acquisition concern s a \nsugar refinery located in G eorgia  and owned by one of th e Defendants , the Court ultimately finds \nthat the interests implicated in  this case are not  limited to Georgia or the immediately surrounding \narea.   If U.S . Sugar is permitted to acquire Imperial Sugar, there appears to be a real risk  that \nreduced com petiti on (and resulting economic harm)  will follow  in a number  of East Coast  states, \nincluding Delaware .  See Energy Sols., 2016 WL 7387069, at *6 (finding local interest factor \nneutral where harm that could result from proposed mer ger \u201cwill be felt by the  firms[\u2019] various \ncustomers, distribut ed throughout 36 states, that rely on the firms for their commercial low -level \nradio active waste disposal needs\u201d).   Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, this factor is neutral.   \n11. Public P olicies of the F ora \nDefendants have not a ddres sed this factor , and the Governme nt suggests this factor weighs \nagainst  transfer.   (D.I. 30 at 18- 19).  The Court generally agrees that this factor weighs against \ntransfer , albeit slightly, because several Defendant s are Delawa re corporation s and publ ic policy \nencourages Delaware corporat ions to resolve disputes in Delaware courts.  See, e.g., Graphics \nProps. Holdings Inc., 964 F. Supp. 2d at 331 (even where only one party is a Delaware corporation, \npublic policy encouraging Del aware corporations to re solve disputes in Delaware weighs agai nst \ntransfer).   There is no similar ar gument for the Southern District of Georgia  as no party is a Georgia \ncompany or a company with its principal place of business in Georgia . 19 12. Familiarity of th e Trial Judge with the A pplic able State Law in \nDiversity C ases        \nThe parti es agree that this factor is neutral as the Government\u2019s  claims arise under federal \nantitrust laws  and the familiarity of the respective districts with state law is not applicab le.   \n13. Balancing the P rivate an d Public F actors  \nAfter balancing  the twelve Jumar a factors, the Court concludes that this case should not \nbe transferred to the Southern District of Georgia .  Eight factors are neutral , and two factor s weigh \nin favor of  transf er, with one favoring tr ansfer only slightly .  Two factors wei gh against  transf er, \nincluding the Government \u2019s choice of this forum, which is to be given paramount consideration.  \nLooking at the factors together and giving each its appropriate weight , Defen dants have failed to \nmeet  the heavy burden of showing that the  Jumara  factors w eigh strongly in favor of transfer.    \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant s\u2019 motion to transfer the case to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern Distric t of Georgia  pursuant to 28 U .S.C. \u00a7 1404(a)  is DENIED .  \nAn ap propriate order w ill follow .  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAW ARE  \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  \n \n   Plaintiff,  \n   v. \n UNITED STATES SUGAR CORPORATION, UNITED SUGARS CORP ORATION, IMPERIAL SUGAR \nCOMPAN Y and LOUIS DREYFUS \nCOMPANY LLC,  \n \n   Defendants.  ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n)  \n   C.A.
