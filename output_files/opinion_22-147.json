No. 22-147-GBW\nDAVID HENDERSON, et al.,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nAlan T. Brooks, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware. Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nLuciana Marie Parker, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice,\nWilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendants.\n\nOctober 2\u201c , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\ni In\n\nWILLIAMS, US. District Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Alan T. Brooks (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), an inmate at the James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center in Smyrna, Delaware, commenced this action on February 1,\n2022, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct.! (D.L. 1). Plaintiff appears pro se and has paid the filing fee. Before the\nCourt had an opportunity to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915A(a),? Plaintiff served Defendants\u2019 and then filed a motion for default\njudgment. (D.I. 5). In turn, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to\nstay. (D.I. 10, 12). The Court will address the motions and will also screen the\ncase as required under the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\nL BACKGROUND\n\nOn May 5, 1987, a jury convicted Plaintiff of felony-murder, first-degree\nrobbery, attempted first-degree robbery, second-degree kidnapping, second-degree\nconspiracy, and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony.\nSee State v. Brooks, 2007 WL 3105883 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 23, 2007). He\nreceived a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the murder conviction\n1 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him\n\nof a federal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state\n\nlaw. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\n\n2 Section 1915A(b)(1) is applicable to all prisoner lawsuits regardless of whether the\nlitigant paid the fee all at once or in installments. Stringer v. Bureau of Prisons, Federal\n\nAgency, 145 F. App\u2019x 751, 752 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\n3 The individual defendants are sued in the individual and official capacities.\n1\n\nand 52 years imprisonment for the remaining offenses. Id. The Delaware Supreme\nCourt affirmed the convictions on appeal and subsequent motions for post-\nconviction relief were denied. Jd. Plaintiff was diagnosed with bipolar and\nadjustment disorder with anxiety around March 1987. (D.I. 1 at { 2). Parole was\ngranted on September 21, 2019 to level 4 home confinement, and for Plaintiff to\nmaintain employment and receive mental health therapy. (/d. at ]4). Plaintiff\nreceived mental health treatment from November 2018 until October 2020. (D.L\n4-1 at 1). He alleges that he has a mental health disability under the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. (DI. 1 at] 9). Sometime between\nFebruary 2019 and October 2020, Plaintiff stopped taking his psychiatric\nmedication. (D.I. 4-1 at 1). He was arrested on October 10, 2020 for assault and\npossession of cocaine and taken into custody. (D.I. 1 at { 5).\n\nAn administrative parole warrant issued based on the two charges. (D.L 4-1\nat 10). On November 2, 2020, while housed at Howard R. Young Correctional\nInstitution, Plaintiff was served with a Notice of Probable Cause Hearing for an\nInterstate Violation of Probation/Parole. (D.1. 4-1 at 3). The notice referenced the\nviolation of two conditions, #s 1 and 7, but the attachment describing the violations\nwas not included with the document. (/d.).\n\nDuring a preliminary hearing held around the same time, Plaintiff was told\n\nby the Supervisor of Parole that, if the charges were dropped, Plaintiff would be\n2\nreleased to Level II status since Plaintiff had complied with all conditions. (/d. at\n10-11). The assault charges were dismissed on March 16, 2021. (dd. at 11). On\nMarch 18, 2021, Plaintiff was taken to a video revocation hearing that was held\nbefore Defendants David Henderson and Jeffery Kays. (D.I. 1 at \u00a2 10, DL 4-1 at\n12). Plaintiff alleges violations of his right to due process because he was not\ngiven advance written notice of the hearing; evidence was not disclosed; he did not\nhave counsel of his choice; and he did not have an opportunity to be heard in\nperson, present evidence, witnesses, or cross-examine witnesses. (D.L 4-1 at 12).\nPlaintiff alleges that Henderson and Kays and Defendant Delaware Parole Board\nMembers arbitrarily denied him access to the Mental Health Court when they\nintentionally violated him. (D.I. 1 at 5-6). A May 20, 2021 letter notified Plaintiff\nthat he was found guilty of violating the following conditions of his parole:\n\n1. You must not commit a new criminal offense or moving motor\nvehicle during the supervision period. This includes Escape after\nConviction, Escape 3\" and motor vehicle offenses.\n\n2. You are not to possess or consume a controlled substance or\nother dangerous drugs unless prescribed lawfully. You are\nsubject to random testing as directed by your supervising office.\n\n(D.1. 4-1 at 2). On May 25, 2021, Plaintiff submitted a written complaint to\nDefendants and received no response to his request for reconsideration. (DL. 1 at\n\n44 14, 15). On December 22, 2021, Plaintiff submitted an ADA grievance and has\n\nnot received a response. (/d. at \u00a7 15). Plaintiff alleges that he was never an\n3\ninterstate parolee or out of the State of Delaware without proper permission. (Jd. at\n{ 17). He alleges that was sent back to Level 5 incarceration on new criminal\ncharges never charged with, or found guilty of (escape after conviction 3d, and\nmotor vehicle offenses), and that Defendants excluded him from the Mental Health\nCourt on the possession charge in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2).\n(DI. 1, 18). Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as well as\ninjunctive and declaratory relief. (Jd. at | VI Relief).\n\nDefendants were served on February 22, 2022. (DI. 14, 15, 16). On March\n25, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment (D.I. 5), on April 13, 2022,\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss, and on April 14, 2022 Defendants a motion\nto stay (D.I. 12). The matters have been fully briefed.\n\nIl. MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT\n\nPlaintiff moves for default judgment against Defendants. (D.I. 5). The\nmotion is premature. Before Plaintiff may bring a motion for default judgment, he\nmust first move for entry of default by the Clerk as provided by Rule 55(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Husain v. Casino Control Comm\u2019n, 265 F.\nApp\u2019x 130, 133 (3d Cir. 2008) (\u201c[E]ntry of default by the Clerk under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 55(a) constitutes a general prerequisite for a subsequent default\njudgment under Rule 55(b)\u201d). Plaintiffs motion for default judgment is not\n\nproperly before the Court, and it will be denied.\n4\nIll. SCREENING/MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nA. Legal Standards\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions\nin which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental defendant). The Court must\naccept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and view them in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party. See Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 229 (3d\nCir. 2010); see also Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 232-33 (3d Cir.\n2008). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and\nthe Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent\nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S.\n89, 94 (2007).\n\nDismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is only appropriate if the pleading does not\ncontain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); see also Fowler v. UPMC\n\nShadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009). This plausibility standard obligates a\n5\nparty to provide \u201cmore than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of\nthe elements of a cause of action.\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Instead, the\npleadings must provide sufficient factual allegations to allow the Court to \u201cdraw\nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d\nIqbal, 556 USS. at 678.\n\nB. Discussion\n\nDefendants move for dismissal on the grounds that: Plaintiff failed to\nproperly serve Defendants under 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3103; Plaintiff fails to state a\nplausible claim that his revocation was unconstitutionally denied based on his\nmental disability in violation of the ADA; the lawsuit is barred for Plaintiff's\nfailure to challenge his continued detainer in State Court or by federal habeas; and,\nthe claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment because Defendants did not\nviolate any constitutional right in the decision to revoke Plaintiff's parole.\n\n1. Service\n\nDefendants seek dismissal on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to properly\neffect service. They argue that the Court docket does not reflect Defendants were\nproperly served and, further, that the Attorney General, State Solicitor, or the Chief\nDeputy Attorney General of the State were not served as statutorily required. For\nproper service of State Defendants, a plaintiff must comply with 10 Del. C. \u00a73103,\n\nas follows:\n(c) No service of summons upon the State, or upon any administrative office,\nagency, department, board or commission of the state government, or\nupon any officer of the state government concerning any matter arising in\nconnection with the exercise of his or her official powers or duties, shall\nbe complete until such service is made upon the person of the Attorney\nGeneral _ or upon the person of the State Solicitor or upon the person of the\nChief Deputy Attorney General.\n10 Del. C. \u00a73103(c).\n\nThe docket reflects that after Defendants filed their motion to dismiss,\nsummonses were executed for Defendants and filed on April 25, 2022 that showed\npersonal service on February 22, 2022. (D.I. 14, 15, 16). The docket does not\nreflect that any designated state officer was served with process and, therefore,\nservice is not legally sufficient. See Drake v. State Dept. Highways and\nTransportation, 1979 WL 195352 (Del. Super. Ct. Nov. 5, 1979) (Both the chief\nexecutive and one of the designated state officers must receive service of process\nfor such service to be legally sufficient.).\n\nTherefore, the Court will grant that portion of the motion to dismiss that\nseeks dismissal for failure to properly serve defendants. The Court exercises its\ndiscretion and will give Plaintiff additional time to serve a designated state officer\nas required by 10 Del. C. \u00a73103(c).\n\n2. Parole\n\nPlaintiff alleges he was denied his right to due process during the parole\n\nrevocation hearing. He also alleges that his mental health was not considered, and\n7\ndiscrimination occurred during the parole hearing due to his disability in violation\nof the ADA. Defendants argue that Plaintiff has no constitutional right to parole,\nhe received proper notice of the revocation hearing by reason of the Notice of\nProbable Cause Hearing for an Interstate Violation of Probation Parole, and\nPlaintiff provides no proof that his parole was revoked solely because of his mental\nillness.\n\nAn inmate has no constitutional right to parole. See Greenholtz v. Inmates of\nNebraska Penal & Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979) (\u201cA state may...\nestablish a parole system, but it has no duty to do so.\u201d); see also Eskridge v.\nCasson, 471 F. Supp. 98, 101 (D. Del. 1979) (\u201c[N]o prisoner can legitimately\nclaim that the Delaware Parole Statute confers . . . a legally enforceable right to be\nparoled.\u201d). As a matter of substantive due process, \u201conce a state institutes a parole\nsystem, all prisoners have a liberty interest flowing directly from the due process\nclause in not being denied parole for arbitrary or constitutionally impermissible\nreasons.\u201d See Taylor v. Henderson, 632 F. App'x 70, 75 n.4 (3d Cir. 2015)\n(quoting Block v. Potter, 631 F.2d 233, 236 (3d Cir. 1980)).\n\nWhen the State convenes a parole hearing, an inmate has a procedural due\nprocess right to be provided with meaningful or adequate notice of the hearing. Cf\nGreenholiz, 442 U.S. at 14 (holding that a system which informs inmates of the\n\nmonth of their parole hearing provides them with \u201cconstitutionally adequate\u201d\n8\nnotice); Patten v. North Dakota Parole Bd., 783 F.2d 140, 143 (8th Cir. 1986)\n(concluding that even though \u201cno process was due\u201d because the state \u201cha[d] not\ncreated a protected liberty interest in parole,\u201d inmates received \u201cample\nopportunity\u201d to present their cases to the parole board). Here, there are no\nallegations that Plaintiff was given notice of the revocation hearing date.\nDefendants contend that the Notice of Probable Cause Hearing for an Interstate\nViolation of Probation/Parole was sufficient notice of the parole revocation\nhearing. While Plaintff was given Notice of Probable Cause Hearing for an\nInterstate Violation of Probation/Parole in November 2020, as alleged he was not\nprovided notice when the hearing would be held and only learned of it on the very\nday of the hearing when he was taken from his cell at HYRCT to attend the\nrevocation hearing via video. The Court therefore finds that, as alleged, Plaintiff\nhas stated a due process claim that he was not provided with adequate notice of the\nrevocation hearing. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on this ground will be denied.\n\nDefendants allege that Plaintiff has not provided proof that his parole was\nrevoked due solely to his mental illness. The Supreme Court has held that Title II\nof the ADA validly abrogates sovereign immunity as to state conduct that actually\nviolates the Constitution. See United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159 (2006).\nTo determine whether a plaintiff may sue a State for damages under Title II, a\n\nCourt must: \u201c(1) identify which aspects of the State\u2019s alleged conduct violated\n9\nTitle II; (2) identify to what extent such conduct also violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title If but did not\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment, determine whether Congress\u2019 purported\nabrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid\n\u201d\u201d Bowers v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, 475 F.3d 524, 553 (3d Cir. 2007).\n\nAs to the first prong, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated the ADA\nwhen they did not consider his mental illness disability and revoked his parole on\nthe basis of his disability. As to the second prong, the Court determines whether\nthe alleged misconduct also violates the Fourteenth Amendment. While there is no\nfederal constitutional right to parole, see Greenholtz, 442 U.S. at 7, there is a due\nprocess right in being treated fairly during the parole process, see Mickens-Thomas\nv. Vaughn, 321 F.3d 374, 393 (3d Cir. 2003) (discussing Parole Board\u2019s duty to\ngive inmate fair hearing in context of due process challenge). See also Block v.\nPotter, 631 F.2d at 240 (holding that denial of parole based on considerations of\nrace may state claim for violation of substantive due process even though there is\nno liberty interest in parole); accord Newman v. Beard, 617 F.3d 775, 784 (3d Cir.\n2010) (observing this is not a case \u201cin which the Parole Board arbitrarily denied\nparole based on race, religion, political beliefs, or another impermissible factor\u201d).\nPlaintiff alleges that he was denied parole based upon an impermissible\n\ndiscriminatory factor and, therefore, alleges a Fourteenth Amendment violation.\n10\nSee Taylor v. Henderson, 662 F. App\u2019x at 75 n.4 (inmate properly asserted his\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the ADA because success on his claims that the\nBoard relied in part on impermissible factors were result in a new parole\ndetermination).\n\nAs to the third prong, this District has previously determined that the\nDelaware Board of Parole is not entitled to sovereign immunity from a lawsuit\nimplicating the rights of a disabled inmate. ).4 See White v. Delaware Bd. of\nParole, 2012 WL 2126920, at *4 (D. Del. June 8, 2012). To the extent Plaintiff\nraises ADA claims against Defendants in their individual capacities seeking\nmonetary damages, the claims will be dismissed. Title II of the ADA does not\nprovide for suits against state officers in their individual capacities but individuals\nmay be sued in their official capacities. See Kokinda v. Pennsylvania. Dep't of\nCorr., 779 F. App\u2019x 938, 942 (3d Cir. 2019); see also Thompson v. Davis, 295\nF.3d 890, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2002) (stating parole may not be denied on basis of\ndisability protected by ADA); see also White v. Bond, 720 F.2d 1002, 1003 (8th\n~ Cir. 1983) (\u201c[A]llegation of racial discrimination in the parole process appears to\n\nstate a cognizable section 1983 claim.\u201d); Bentley v. Tennis, Civ.A. No. 3:CV-06-\n\nSection V of Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss seeks dismissal of the ADA claims by reason\nof the Eleventh Amendment. As just discussed, this District has decided the issue to the\ncontrary. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on this ground will be denied.\n\nil\n\n2073, 2007 WL 4248258, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 30, 2007) (\u201cUnder substantive due\nprocess, a state may not deny parole on constitutionally impermissible grounds,\nsuch as race or in retaliation for exercising constitutional rights [or because of]\nfactors bearing no rational relationship to the interests of the [state].\u201d).\n\nTitle II as applied to cases implicating the rights of a disabled inmate (Z.e.,\none with a history of mental illness abuse) to a fair parole process is a valid\nexercise of Congress' authority to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Accordingly, the Court will deny Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\nPlaintiff's claim that he was not given the benefit of full and fair consideration for\nparole by reason of his disability under the ADA.\n\n3. Habeas Corpus\n\nDefendants move for dismissal on the grounds that Plaintiff's damages claim\nis Heck-barred because he did not successfully challenge his continued detainer in\nState Court or by federal habeas. Plaintiff argues that his constitutional rights were\nviolated before and during his revocation hearing because he was denied his right\nto due process.\n\nApplying the rule in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), the Third\nCircuit has held that \u00a7 1983 actions that, if successful, would necessarily\ndemonstrate the invalidity of a parole board\u2019s decision (regarding the length or\n\nrevocation of parole) are not cognizable unless and until the board\u2019s decision has\n12\n\nbeen invalidated. See Williams v. Consovoy, 453 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir. 2006).\nTo the extent Plaintiff claims that Defendants made erroneous findings during the\nrevocation hearing, the claim is barred under Heck. Had Defendants made\nerroneous findings, success on this claim would necessarily invalidate the parole\nboard\u2019s decision.\n4. Eleventh Amendment\n\nPlaintiff names the Delaware Parole Board as a defendant and also raises\nclaims against the individual defendants in their official capacities. The Eleventh\nAmendment of the United States Constitution protects an unconsenting state or state\nagency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens, regardless of\nthe relief sought. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996);\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), Edelman v.\nJordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). Delaware has not waived its immunity from suit in\nfederal court; although Congress can abrogate a state\u2019s sovereign immunity, it did\nnot do so through the enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Jones v. Sussex Corr. Inst.\n725 F. App\u2019x 157, 159-160 (3d Cir. 2017); Brooks-McCollum v. Delaware, 213 F.\nApp\u2019x 92, 94 (3d Cir. 2007).\n\nThe Parole Board, an agency of the State of Delaware, is entitled to\nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. See Harper v. Jeffries, 808\n\nF.2d 281, 284 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986) (any action by appellant against Parole Board is\n13\nbarred by Eleventh Amendment); see also State v. Jackson, 2013 WL 1561511, at\n*1 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 28, 2013) (referring to Delaware Board of Parole as State\nagency). In addition, \u201ca suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is\nnot a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official\u2019s office. As\nsuch, it is no different from a suit against the State itself.\u201d Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t\nof State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) (internal citations omitted); Ali v Howard,\n353 F. App\u2019x 667, 672 (3d Cir. 2009). Accordingly, \u00a7 1983 claims for monetary\ndamages against a state, state agency, or a state official in his official capacity are\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment. See id.\n\nFinally, the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against the Board of Parole, fail as it is\nnot a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Madden v. New Jersey\nState Parole Bd., 438 F.2d 1189, 1190 (3d Cir. 1971) (New Jersey State Parole\nBoard is not person under \u00a7 1983); see also White v. Delaware Board of Parole,\n2013 WL 3991963, at *4 (D. Del. July 31, 2013) (Delaware Board of Parole is not\nperson under \u00a7 1983); Davis v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Prob. and Parole, 2006 WL\n3308440, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 13, 2006) (discussing issue that Parole Board is not\n\u201cperson\u201d within meaning of \u00a7 1983).\n\nTherefore, this Court will dismiss the \u00a7 1983 claims against the Board of\nParole and the individual defendants in their official capacities based their immunity\n\nfrom suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(2).\n14\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiffs motion for default\njudgment (D.I. 5); (2) grant in part and deny in part Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\n(D.1. 10); (3) deny as moot Defendants\u2019 motion to stay (D.I. 12); and (4) give\nPlaintiff additional time to effect service as required by 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3103(c).\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n15\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nALAN T. BROOKS,\nPlaintiff,\n\n)\n)\n)\n)\nv. ) CA.
