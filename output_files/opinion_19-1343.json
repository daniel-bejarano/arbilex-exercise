{"case_name": "Shure Inc. vs Clearone, Inc.", "case_number": "19-1343", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "05-27-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSHURE INCORPORATED , and SHURE \nACQUISITION HOLDINGS , INC., \nPlaintiffs ; Civil Action No. 19-1343-RGA \nV. \nCLEARONE , INC., \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nShure sued ClearOne for patent infringement and various business torts. (D.I. 64). Just \nover six weeks before trial, Shure sent a letter informing the Court that it was withdrawing its \nbusiness tort claims. (D.I. 548). Upon receiving this letter, the Magistrate Judge ordered the \nparties to meet and confer \"regarding the appropriate disposition of Shure's non-patent claims \n(e.g. dismissal with or without prejudice ).\" (D.I. 555). The parties could not agree, and \nClearOne filed the present motion to dismiss. (D.I. 562). I now address that motion. \nThe parties seem to agree that the claims must be dismissed. The real battle is whether \nthe claims should be dismissed with or without prejudice. (D.I. 563 at 10; D.I. 589 at 14). Shure \nargues that they should be dismissed as moot, pointing to Archer DX, LLC v. Qiagen Sciences, \nLLC, C.A. No. 18-1019, D.I. 419 (D. Del. July 26, 2021). (D.I. 589 at 14). ClearOne argues that \nthe claims should be dismissed with prejudice and offers some procedural devices through which \nI might do so. \n1 In the normal course of litigation , parties narrow claims and defenses as trial approaches. \nI have previousl y found that claims dropped on the eve of trial are dropped with prejudice. Bio\u00ad\nRad Labs., Inc. v. JOXGenomics , Inc., C.A. No. 15-152-RGA, D.I. 561 at 1 (D. Del. July 9, \n2019). In this case, Shure dropped its claims while ClearOne 's summary judgment and Daubert \nmotions were pending. At Shu.re's suggestion , the Court denied ClearOne's motions as moot. \n(D.I. 548, 555, 571, 575). \nShure suggests that a different outcome is appropriate here because the claims were \ndropped over six weeks before trial, not on \"the eve of trial.\" (D.I. 589 at 10-11). That the \nclaims were not dropped literally hours before trial misses the point. (Id. at 11 ). These claims \nwere poised for a final disposition. Allowing Shure to file a new lawsuit tomorrow asserting \nthese very claims would lead to excessive, duplicative expenses. Shure brought its business \nclaims more than two years before dropping them. (D.I. 19, 548). The parties litigated the \nclaims extensivel y in this forum. Pretrial exchanges were ongoing, and a dispositive motion was \npending. (D.I. 531,449). Shure informally dropped its business tort claims less than two \nmonths before trial without much explanation and failed to formalize that decision. \nShure relies heavily onArcherDX , where the Plaintiffs ' withdrawn claims were dismissed \nas moot. (D.I. 589 at 14). In such discretionary matters, it is unsurprising that different \ncircumstances lead to different outcomes . Here, I think that dismissal with prejudice is \nappropriate. \nClearOne asks me to dismiss under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and \noffers arguments on the equitable factors that would go into whether the dismissal should be with \nprejudice. Shure responds that Rule 41(a) allows dismissal of \"an action\" rather than individual \nclaims. There is support for Shu.re's position in the caselaw. See Perry v. Schumacher Grp. of \n2 Louisiana , 891 F.3d 954,958 (11th Cir. 2018) (\"It is clear from the text that only an 'action' \nmay be dismissed. \").1 The alternative is to treat the dropping of a claim as an amendment under \nRule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See id. Under Rule 15, I have \"extensive \ndiscretion to decide whether to grant leave to amend after the time for amendment as a matter of \ncourse has passed.\" Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure Civil 3d, \u00a7 1486 (2010). I \ntherefore construe Shure's letter withdrawing its business tort claims as a request to amend its \ncomplaint. See Gronholz v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 836 F.2d 515, 518 (Fed. Cir. 1987) \n(\"Gronholz's dismissal of the patent claim constituted an amendment of his complaint. \"). I will \nso treat the motion. \nShure requests that, should I dismiss with prejudice , I order each side to pay their own \nfees and expenses. (D.I. 598 at 14-15). It seems likely to me that is the main reason for this \ndispute. That is, whether I hold the claims are dismissed or withdrawn with prejudice , I have a \nhard time thinking that Shure could ever actually refile the claims without them being barred by \nclaim preclusion principles. Even assuming that I have the power now to decide attorneys ' fees \nor costs issues in relation to this particular dispute, the business tort claims were merely a piece \nof the bigger dispute between the parties, which has included a trial on a design patent and \nbusiness tort counterclaims that are still pending. This is not the time to carve out a portion of \nthe case and to decide on attorneys' fees and expenses in relation to that portion. \n1 Whatever the caselaw may suggest, my experience is that parties routinely agree to \"dismiss\" \nclaims and I just as routinely \"so order\" the agreement. I expect all the judges of this Court do \nthat. \n3 Plaintiffs ' amendment of the complaint to withdraw the previously asserted Counts II, III, \nIV, and Vis GRANTED. The counts are WITHDRAWN WITH PREJUDICE. Defendant 's \nmotion to dismiss (D.I. 562) is DISMISSED as moot. \nIT IS SO ORDERED thisJ;f day of May, 2022. \n4 "}
