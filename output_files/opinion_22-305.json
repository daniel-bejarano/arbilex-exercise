Andrews", "date": "11-14-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nROBOCAST, INC., \nPlaintiff, ( \nV. Civil Action No. 22-305-RGA \nNETFLIX, INC. \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM \n\u00b7 :eefore me is Defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (D.I. 11). The \nmotion has been fully briefed and I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 12, 18, 19). For the \nreasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis is a patent infringement action. On March 7, 2022, Plaintiff Robocast filed its \nComplaint against Defendant Netflix, alleging direct, indirect, and willful infringement of U.S. \nPatent Nos. 7,155,451 (\"the ',A51 patent\"), 8,606,819 (\"the '819 patent\"), and 8,965,932 (\"the '932 \n< \npatent'~) (collectively, \"the asserted patents\"). (D.I. 1). The asserted patents relate to methods of \nautomating the presentation of computer content. (Id. at 5). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nthe Court must accept the complaint's factual allegations as true. See Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, \n1 but they must provide more than labels, conclusions, or a \"formulaic recitation\" of the claim \nelements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in \nfact).\"). Moreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to \n\\ \nrelief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when \nthe complaint's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. (\"Where a ,complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\" ( cleaned up)). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Direct Infringement \nTo satisfy the Iqbal/Twombly pleading standard in a patent case, \"[s]pecific facts are not \nnecessary.\" Disc Disease Solutions Inc. v. VGH Solutions, Inc., 888 F.3d 1256, 1260 (Fed. Cir. \n2018) (quoting Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007)). A complaint need only give the \ndefendant \"fair notice of what the [infringement] claim is and the ground upon which it rests.\" Id. \nNetflix contends that the Complaint has failed to provide fair notice because Robocast did \nnot show how the accused products and features infringed. (D.I. 12 at 4-5). I agree with Robocast \nthat no such showing is required. Disc Disease, the case Robocast relies upon for this point, is \ninstructive, There, the Federal Circuit reversed a district court's dismissal of the complaint on the \nbasis that the plaintiff had failed to \"explain how Defendants' products infringe on any of Plaintiffs \nclaims\" as the complaint \"merely alleges that certain of Defendants' products 'meet each and every \nelement of at least one claim' of Plaintiffs patents.\" Disc Disease, 888 F.3d at 1260. The Federal \n2 Circuit found that the plaintiffs allegations were sufficient under Iqbal/Twombly, explaining that \nthe complaint specifically identified the accused products and alleged that those products met each \nand every element of at least one claim of the patents-in-suit. Id These disclosures and allegations \nwere enough to provide the defendants with \"fair notice\" of infringement of the asserted patents. \nId Just so here. In its Complaint, Robocast identifies the accused products and features-the \n\"Netflix Internet platform\" and its \"automated video playlists,\" such as its \"Autoplay playlists,\" \nI \n\"Flixtape playlists,\" and \"all other static or dynamic video playlists provided by Netflix\" (D.I. 1 at \n14 )-and alleges that the platform and its play lists satisfy each limitation of \"at least claim 1\" of \neach of the asserted patents. (Id at 17, 19, 21). \nNetflix argues that there are important facts in this case which distinguish it from Disc \nDisease. (D.I. 19 at 2-4). It posits that, unlike the plaintiff in Disc Disease-which specifically \nidentified the accused products \"by name and by attaching photos of the product packaging as \nexhibits,\" 888 F.3d at i260-Robocast offers only \"ambiguous\" allegations (D.I. 19 at 2). Thus, \nsays Netflix, this case is less like Disc Disease and more like Promos Technologies, Inc. v. Samsung \nElectronics Co., 2018 WL 5630585 (D. Del. Oct 31, 2018). (D.I. 12 at 10). There, I held that \nallegations directed to unidentified products failed to meet the pleading standard because the \nplaintiff alleged no facts articulating how those products infringed the patents-in-suit. Promos, \n2018 WL 5630585 at *4 (\"Where an accused infringing product is not identified by name, the \nplaintiff must allege how the accused infringing class of products infringe the asserted patents.\"). \n\u00b7 Netflix urges a similar result here. \nNetflix's reliance on Promos is inapposite. I held that the plaintiff's allegations failed to \nprovide fair notice because they were directed to a \"broad class\" of unnamed products. Id By \n3 / \ncontrast, as explained above, Robocast specifically directed its allegations to the products and \nfeatures it alleges have infringed (the ''Netflix Internet platform\" and its associated \"automated \nplaylists\"). This is enough for identification purposes; Robocast need not provide, as Net:flix \nincorrectly insists that it must, \"websites, images, or other support.\" (D.I. 19 at 2). Because \nRobocast sufficiently identifies the accused products and features, it is not required to demonstrate \nhow those products and features infringe. Even if it were so required, however, Robocast's \nComplaint would pass muster, as Robocast alleges facts articulating the ways in which Netflix's \ntechnology infringes the asserted patents.1 (See, e.g., D.I. 1 at 14-15). \nNetflix also argues that in contrast to the \"simple\" mechanical device technology involved \nin the asserted patents in Disc Disease, 888 F.3d at 1260, the complex software-based technology \nat issue here suggests a higher threshold for providing fair notice. (D.I. 19 at 2). Netflix points to \nBot MB LLC v. Sony Corp. of Am., 4 F.4th 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2021), in which the Federal Circuit \nrecognized that \"the compl~xity of the technology\" is a factor in assessing the sufficiency of \nallegations. Id at 1352-53. Whether the technology in this case can be classified as simple or \ncomplex is immaterial here, as I find that other aspects of Robocast's Complaint-such as the \nidentifications and factual allegations described above-' provide the \"fair notice\" that lies at the \nheart of the Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry. \n-\n1 Robocast has not specified in its Complaint that Net:flix's allegedly infringing activity occurred \nduring the enforceable term of each of the asserted patents. Contrary to Netflix's assertions (e.g., \nD.I. 12 at 11), this omission is not fatal to Robocast. Viewing the factual allegations in the \nComplaint in the \"light most favorable to the plaintiff,\" Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d \n780, 791 (3d Cir. 2016), I can reasonably infer that the allegedly infringing acts occurred during \nthe relevant damages Reriod of each of the asserted patents (between March 7, 2016 and August \n9, 2020 for the '451 patent, and between March 7, 2016 and September 2, 2017 for the '819 and \n, '932 patents). (See D.I. 18 at 10). \n4 For these reasons, I conclude that Robocast has sufficiently stated a claim for direct \ninfringement. I therefore DENY Netflix's motion to dismiss with respect to Robocast's claims of \ndirect infringement, with the exception of Robocast's vicarious liability claims, which I discuss \nbelow. \nB. Vicarious Liability for Direct Infringement \nAll that Robocast alleges with respect to these claims is that Netflix is \"vicariously liable \nfor ... direct infringement by exercising control or direction over the practicing ... of at least claim \n1 of the '451 patent ... conducted by an as yet unknown third party pursuant to a principal-agent \nrelationship, a contractual relationship, a joint enterprise, or other like arrangement.\" (D.I. 1 at 17). \nAs a threshold matter, contrary to Robocast's assertions (D.I. 18 at 11 ), it is not \"premature\" \nto decide issues of vicarious liability for infringement under Rule 12(b )( 6). Courts routinely decide \nthe sufficiency of these sorts of claims at the motion to disi;niss stage. See, e.g., Lyda v. CBS Corp., \n838 F.3d 1331, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2016) Goint infringement). Robocast's argument-that such \ndecisions are generally premature \"because they raise questions regarding claim con~truction and \nthe infringement analysis necessarily based thereon\" (D.I. 18 at 11 )-is based on a misreading of \nNalco v. Chem-Mod, LLC, 883 F.3d 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The Nalco court declined to resolve \nthe plaintiff's claims at the R~le 12(b )(6) stage in part because the defendanp s objections to those \nclaims \"boil[ed] down to objections to [Plaintiff's] proposed claim construction.\" Id at 1349. Here, \nthe parties have neither identified any claim construction issues nor advanced arguments dependent \non such issues. I will therefore proceed to consider the sufficiency ofRobocast's vicarious liability \nclaims. \n5 A claim of direct infringement based on vicarious liability requires \"pleading facts \nsufficient to allow a reasonable inference that all steps of the claimed method are performed and \neither\u00b7 (1) one party exercises the requisite 'direction or control' over the others' performance or \n(2) the actors form a joint enterprise such that performance of every step is attributable to the \ncontrolling party.\" Lyda, 83 8 F.3d at 1339 (internal citations omitted). Robocast, however, offers \nno factual basis for its claim. Indeed, the Complaint fails to identify any third parties at all, 2 let \nalone allege facts supporting a relationship between those parties and Netflix. \nFor these reasons, I conclude that Robocast fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim \nfor vicarious liability. I therefore GRANT Netflix's motion to dismiss Robocast's vicarious \nliability claims. \nC. Indirect and Willful Infringement \nIndirect infringement \"requires knowledge of the patent in suit and knowledge of patent \ninfringement.\" Cammi/ USA, LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc., 575 U.S. 632, 639 (2015) (inducement \nand contributory infringement). A determination of willful infringement requires a finding of \n\"deliberate or intentional\" infringement. SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 14 F.4th 1323, 1330 \n(Fed. Cir. 2021). The complaint must allege that the accused infringer knew of the asserted patent, \nand knowingly or intentionally infringed the patent after acquiring that knowledge. Eko Brands, \nLLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters., Inc., 946 F.3d 1367, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2020). With respect \nto both indirect and willful infringement claims, a plaintiff can meet the knowledge requirement \n2 In its Opposition Brief, Robocast argues that it has identified \"registered account holders\" as the \nrelevant third parties. (D.I. 18 at 12). Although Robocast identifies \"registered account holders\" in \nits Complaint, it appears to do so with respect to its indirect infringement claims alone. (D.I. 1 at \n15-16, 18). \n6 by showing \"willful blindness,\" which \"requires the patentee to show not only that the accused \nsubjectively believed that there was a high risk of infringement, but also that the accused took \ndeliberate actions to avoid confirming infringement.\" Unwired Planet, LLC v. Apple Inc., 829 F.3d \n1353, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2016)(inducement). \nNetflix contends that Robocast has failed to state claims of indirect and willful \ninfringement. because (1) Robocast fails to plausibly allege pre-suit knowledge of the asserted \npatents; and (2) Robocast fails to plausibly allege that Netflix had knowledge of or intent to cause \ninfringement. (D.I. 12 at 13). Because I conclude that Netflix's first argument prevails, I need not \nconsider its second argument. \nRobocast did not provide Netflix with actual notice of the asserted patents. (D.I. 12 at 4). \nNevertheless, Robocast alleges several distinct ways in which Netflix obtained pre-suit knowledge. \nAll are insufficient. \nFirst, Robocast alleges that Netflix had notice of the '451 patent based on prior litigation \nbetween Microsoft and Robocast regarding that patent. (D.I. 1 at 12-14). That litigation concluded \nin 2014 and resulted in Microsoft licensing each of the patents-in-suit. (Id at 13); see Robocast, \nInc. v. Microsoft Corp., Case No. 10-1055 (D. Del. Dec. 06, 2010). Robocast's theory centers upon \ntwo individuals, both affiliated with N etflix, who were affiliated with Microsoft while the \nMicrosoft case was pending: Mr. Reed Hastings, Netflix founder, chairman, and CEO, who served \non the Microsoft board from 2007 until 2012, and Mr. Brad Smith, Netflix board member since \n2015, who served as Microsoft's general counsel starting in 2002 and held that positiol'1: during the \nMicrosoft litigation. (!d ). Robocast alleges that by holding these roles at Microsoft, Mr. Smith and \nMr. Hastings obtained knowledge of the '4 51 patent. (Id) It further alleges that N etflix, by virtue \n7 of its relationship with these individuals, knew, should have known, or was willfully blind as to \nthe existence of the '451 patent as well. (Id.). \nThis theory is speculative. Nowhere in the Complaint does Robocast allege that Mr. Smith \nor Mr. Hastings were involved in the Microsoft litigation such that it is plausible that they might \nI \nhave learned of the '451 patent; Robocast simply assumes that the role of general counsel and \nboard member granted them that knowledge. Even if this assumption were correct, Robocast \n.alleges no specific facts suggesting that the knowledge of Mr. Smith and Mr. Hastings can \nplausibly be imputed to N etflix. 3 As N etflix notes (D .I. 19 at 9 ), courts in this district have rejected \nsimilar imputation theories. See ReefEdge Networks, LLC v. Juniper Networks, Inc., 29 F. Supp. \n3d 455, 458-59 (D. Del. 2014) (insufficient pleading of pre-suit knowledge where plaintiff failed \nto allege specific facts \"linking knowledge [defendant's counsel] may have acquired from her work r \nat [third-party company and former patent owner] to her work at [defendant corporation]\"). I do \nso again here. \nSecond, Robocast alleges that Netflix obtained knowledge of the '451 patent in 2016, when \nNetflix became a licensee of two patent portfolios that include patents or patent applications with \ncitations to the '451 patent. (D.I. 1 at 13). Robocast, however, fails to sufficiently distinguish cases \nin which this court has dismissed a plaintiff's allegations of pre-suit knowledge based on similar \nlicensing agreements with a third party. See, e.g., EON Corp. IP Holdings LLC v. FLO TV Inc., \n3 Robocast contends that Netflix's argument to this effect, as well as its argument regarding the \nsufficiency of Robocast's allegations with respect to Mr. Smith's and Mr. Hastings's roles at \nMicrosoft, constitute a disputation of the facts and are therefore improper to consider under Rule \n12(b)(6). (D.I. 18 at 14-15). I disagree. As Netflix rightly notes (D.I. 18 at 7-8), its arguments go , \nto the plausibility ofRobocast's factual allegations and are therefore relevant to the Rule 12(b)(6) \nmqmry. \n8 802 F. Supp. 2d 527 (D. Del. 2011). In EON, the court held that one such licensing agreement\u00ad\nin which the asserted pa~ent was \"one of fourteen\" and \"one of ninety-eight\" patents \u00b7cited as prior \nart on the face of the patents in the license agreements---established \"too tenuous a link\" between \nthe asserted patent and defendants to sustain an allegation of knowledge. Id. at 533. Here, the \nalleged link is similarly attenuated, and without further information about the number of patents \nor patent applications included in the patent portfolios at issue-which Robocast does not \nprovide-I am unable to conclude that Robocast has plausibly alleged pre-suit knowledge on this \nbasis. \nRobocast does not allege specific facts regarding Netflix's pre-suit knowledge of the '819 \nand '932 patents. Neither patent was involved in the Microsoft case. The '819 patent was issued \nin December of 2013, while the case was pending, but it was never asserted in that litigation; the \n'932 patent was issued in February of 2015, after the case had concluded. (See D.I. 1 at 3). \nNevertheless, Robocast maintains that because these patents are continuations of the '451 parent, \nits allegations regarding Netflix's knowledge of the parent patent are sufficient to allege \nknowledge of the child patents as of the date of their issuance. (Id. at 3-4, 12-14; D.I. 18 at 17). \nBecause I find that Robocast' s allegations with respect to the '451 patent are. insufficient, I need \nnot address its arguments with respect to the other two patents. \nI conclude that Robocast fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for indirect and \nwillful infringement. I therefore GRANT Netflix's motion to dismiss Robocast's indirect and \nwillful infringement claims. \n9 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I will GRANT in part and DENY in part Netflix's motion to . . \ndismiss. (D.I. 11). Robocast's claims for vicarious liability for direct infringement, indirect \ninfringement, and willful infringement are DISMISSED without prejudice. Per Robocast's request \n(D.I. 18 at 20), I grant Robocast leave to amend its Complaint within three weeks. \nAn appropriate order will follow.
