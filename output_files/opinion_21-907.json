As announced at the hearing on June 3, 2022, I recommend that the \nmotion  be GRANTED.  My Report and Recommendation was announced from the bench at the \nconclusion of the hearing as follows : \nThis is my Report and Recommendation on the pending \nmotion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay the action in \nPatterson v. Hennessy, C.A. No. 21- 907.1   \n  \nI have carefully reviewed the complaint filed by Plaintiff and \nthe parties\u2019  briefing on the motion , including the exhibits submitted \nby Defendants.2  No one has suggested that it would be improper for \nthe Court to consider the exhibits, which mostly consist of litigation \n \n1 (D.I. 37.)  \n \n2 (D.I. 38, 39, 42, 43, 44.)  2 \n documents and materials filed with the SEC that were referenced in \nthe c ompla int.3 \n \nThe parties did not request argument on this motion, but I \nheard a lengthy oral argument yesterday, June 2, 2022.  I will summarize the reasons for my recommendation in a moment.  But before I do, I want to be clear that  my failure to address a particular \nargument does not mean that I did not consider it.  I also note that, while we will not be issuing a separate written recommendation, we will issue a written document incorporating the recommendation that I am about to make  from the be nch. \n  \nFor the following reasons, I recommend that the Court grant  \nDefendants \u2019 motion to dismiss.  \n  \nPlaintiff Claude L. Patterson filed this derivative action on \nJune 25, 2021, on behalf of nominal defendant Canoo, Inc. \n(\u201cCanoo\u201d).  Canoo was formed after a merger between Hennessy \nCapital Acquisition Corp. IV ( \u201cHCAC IV\u201d ) and Canoo Holdings , \nLtd. ( \u201cCanoo H oldings \u201d).   \n  Prior to the merger HCAC IV was a special purpose \nacquisition company (SPAC) \u2014that is, it was a company formed for \nthe sole purpose of acquiring an existing business, sometimes \nreferred to as a \u201c blank check \u201d company.\n4  On August 18, 2020, \nHCAC IV announced that it had entered into a merger agreement (the \u201cMerger \u201d) with Canoo Holdings.\n5  In connection with the \nMerger announcement, HCAC IV and Canoo Holdings filed a registration statement on SEC Form S -4, which included a \nsolicitation of HCAC IV shareholder proxies to approve the Merger (the \u201c Proxy Statement \u201d).\n6   \n \n3 See Buck v. Hampton Twp. Sch. Dist., 452 F.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir. 2006)  (\u201cIn evaluating a \nmotion to dismiss, we may consider documents that are attached to or submitted with the complaint . . . and any \u2018 matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial \nnotice, matters of public record, orders,  [and] items appearing in the record of the case. \u2019\u201d (quoting \n5B Charles A.

It described Canoo as an electric vehicle company with a modular \u201cskateboard\u201d  technology platform to facilitate electric \nvehicle development.\n7 The proxy also stated that Canoo had a n \n\u201cengineering and technology s ervices\u201d  business that \u201c covers \nmaterial consulting and contract engineering work \u201d done by the \ncompany.8  According to the proxy, \u201cContract Engineering services \noffer a separate revenue stream and validate the quality of our technology. \u201d\n9  \n  Relevant to this case, the proxy also stated the following:  \n (1) \u201cThe [engineering and technology services] \nbusiness offers a unique opportunity to generate immediate revenues in advance of the offering of our first vehicles and our current pipeline in this area is supportive of a projected $120 million of revenue in 2021\u201d;\n10 and  \n (2) \u201cIn February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group \nentered into an agreement with Canoo to co- develop \na future EV platform based on Canoo\u2019 s modular and \nscalable skateboard technology, pr oviding further \nvalidation of Canoo\u2019 s technical leadership and \nexternal confidence in its commercial prospects. \u201d\n11  \n  The Proxy Statement was amended on November 25, \n2020.\n12  The Merger was approved at a shareholder meeting on \nDecember 21, 2020.13   \n  On J anuary 13, 2021, Canoo filed a Shelf Registration \nStatement on Form S -1 with the SEC.  It contained similar \n \n7 (D.I. 39, Ex. 12 at 170.)  \n \n8 (Id. at 177.)  \n \n9 (D.I. 1 \u00b6 102; D.I. 39, Ex. 12 at 180.)  \n \n10 (D.I. 39, Ex. 12 at 170.)  \n \n11 (Id. at 163. ) \n \n12 (D.I. 39, Ex. 10.)  \n   \n13 (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 79.)   4 \n statements about the engineering and technology services business \nand the partnership with Hyundai.14   \n  On March 29, 2021, Canoo announced its 2020 fourth \nquarter and full year financial results.   Those results indicated that \nthe engineering and technology services business had zero revenue during Q4.\n15  Also on March 29, 2021, defendant Tony Aquila, \nExecutive Chairman of Canoo, announced during an earnings conference call with analysts and investors that the Company had decided to \u201c de-emphasize [its] contract  engineering services line \u201d \nand had placed it s arrangement with Hyundai \u201con hold.\u201d\n16   \n  Following that news, Canoo\u2019 s stock crashed more than 21% \nin a single day.\n17  Three separate shareholder securities fraud actions \nwere filed in California .18   \n  Plaintiff filed this derivative action on June 25, 2021.  The \ncomplaint has four counts: Count I is a claim under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act;\n19 Count II seeks contribution under \nSection 21D of the Exchange Act20 against defendants named as \ndefendants in the shareholder securities fraud actions; Count III is a state law breach of fiduciary duty claim against individual defendants; and Count IV is an unjust enrichment claim against \nindividual defendants.   \n  \nDefendants have moved to dismiss this action or, in the \nalternative, to stay it pending resolution of the California securities \nactions.\n21    \n \n \n14 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17\u201321 ; D.I. 39, Ex. 13 at 174, 181.)  \n \n15 (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 24, 111.)   \n \n16 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 112\u201313.)  \n \n17 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 119.)   \n \n18 Blake v.

My understanding of the law is set forth \nin my recent Pattern Energy  decision, and I incorporate it by \nreference.22  \n \nThis is a derivative suit brought on behalf of Canoo, which \nmeans that Plaintiff seeks to displace the Canoo board \u2019s decision -\nmaking authority over whether to bring this suit.  Under Delaware law, a stockholder seeking to maintain a derivative suit must either (1) make a demand on the company \u2019s board of directors or (2) show \nthat demand would have been futile.\n23 \n In addition, the complaint needs to comply with Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23.1, which requires derivative plaintiffs to plead \u201cwith particularity \u201d efforts made to obtain the desired action from \nthe board as well as the reasons such action was not obtained or such efforts were not made.\n24   \n  \n \n22 In re Pattern Energy Grp. Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 20- 275-MN-JLH, 2022 WL 263312, at \n*6 (D. Del. Jan. 27, 2022), report and recommendation adopted, 2022 WL 957761 (Mar. 30, 2022) .  A defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. \n544, 570 (2007)). A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the  misconduct \nalleged.\u201d Id.  (citing  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556). A possibility of relief is not enough. Id. \u201cWhere a \ncomplaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely consistent with\u2019 a defendant \u2019s liability, it \u2018stops short of \nthe line between possibility and plausibil ity of entitlement to relief.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 557). \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint, I must assume all \u201cwell -pleaded facts\u201d are \ntrue but need not assume the truth of legal conclusions. Id. at 679. \u201c[W]hen the allegations  in a \ncomplaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (internal quotation marks  omitted).  \n \n23 United Food & Com. Workers Union & Participating Food Indus. Emps. Tri -State \nPension Fund v. Zuckerberg , 262 A.3d 1034, 1047 (Del. 2021). \n \n24 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1(b)(3);  Kantor v. Barella , 489 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2007).  \n   6 \n Plaintiff did not make a pre -suit demand.  Accordingly, \nplaintiff was required to plead with particularity why demand is \nexcused as futile under Delaware law.25 \n \nThe Delaware Supreme Court recently set forth a three- part \ntest for assessing whether demand should be excused as futile.  As set forth by the Delaware Supreme Court,  \n \ncourts should ask the following three questions on a \ndirector -by-director basis when evaluating \nallegations of demand futility:  \n  \n(i) whether the director received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct that is the subject of the litigation deman d; \n  \n(ii) whether the director faces a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that would be the subject of the litigation demand; and \n  \n(iii) whether the director lacks independence from someone who received a material personal benefit fr om the alleged misconduct \nthat would be the subject of the litigation \ndemand or who would face a substantial \nlikelihood of liability on any of the claims that are subject of the litigation demand.\n26 \n \nFor purposes of demand excusal, we look at the board of \ndirectors as constituted when the lawsuit was filed.27  If the answer \nto any of the Zuckerberg  questions is \u201cyes\u201d for at least half of the \nmembers of the demand board, then demand is excused as futile.28   \n \nThere were nine members on the demand board at the time \nPlaintiff filed this action, only seven  of which are named as \n \n25 Kanter , 489 F.3d at  176 ( \u201c[F]ederal courts hearing shareholders \u2019 derivative actions \ninvolving state law claims apply the federal procedural requirement of particularized pleading, but apply state substantive law to determine whether the facts demonstrate demand would have been futile and can be excused. \u201d). \n \n26 Zuckerberg , 262 A.3d at  1059. \n \n27 See i d. at 1048. \n \n28 Id. at 1059.  7 \n defendants.  Plaintiff does not allege that any of the nine  members \nof the demand board lack independence under Zuckerberg  question \n3.   \n  \nPlaintiff only  alleges that two  members of the demand board \n(Ethridge and Aquila) have a \u201c yes\u201d answer to question 1.  But I\u2019m \nnot even going to address question 1 because Plaintiff still needs to demonstrate that at least three  additional members of the demand \nboard have a \u201c yes\u201d answer to question 2, and I conclude that he has \nfailed to do so.   \nAgain, question 2 asks whether the director faces a \nsubstantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that would be the subject of the litigation demand.   Only two directors (Ethridge \nand Aquila, the same directors that Plaintiff says have a \u201c yes\u201d to \nquestion 1) are named as defendants in the federal claims (the assertion of which is the reason this case is in federal court instead of state court).  Plaintiff doesn \u2019t dispute that if only the federal \nclaims were asserted, Plaintiff could not show demand futility and the case would have to be dismissed.   \nHowever, Plaintiff contends that he has adequately alleged \nthat at least three  additional directors face a substantial likelihood of \nliability with respect to the state law claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  It was clarified during the course of briefing and oral argument \nthat Plaintiff \u2019s theory on the fiduciary duty claim is that the board \nmembers knowingly made (or  caused) misleading statements.  This \ntype of claim is referred to as a Malone  claim.\n29 \n  \nPutting aside Ethridge and Aquila, and putting aside the two \nmembers of the demand board who aren\u2019 t named as defendants, \nthere are five  members of the demand board left, so the complaint \nneeds to plead with particularity that at least three  of those five \nknowingly disseminated or permitted misleading statements.    \n  There is no dispute that those five board members did not \nbecome board m embers until after the merger in December 2020.  \nThere is also no dispute that the only challenged statements that occurred after the merger are the statements in the January 13, 2021 \nSEC Form S -1 Registration statement that Canoo\u2019 s engineering and \ntechnol ogy services business was \u201c supportive of a projected $120 \nmillion of revenue in 2021\u201d  and a \u201c strategic pipeline for future \nbusiness opportunities,\u201d  and that \u201c [i]n February 2020, [Canoo] \n \n29 See Malone v. B rincat , 722 A.2d 5 (Del. 1998).  \n 8 \n entered into an agreement with Hyundai [] to develop a future EV \nplatform . . . .\u201d30   \n  Plaintiff contends that those statements are false and \nmisleading because, at the time they were made, Canoo \u201chad already, or was in the process of, abandoning [sic] its engineering and technology services business , . . . was no longer generating \nengineering and technology services revenues , [and] had already, or \nwas in the process of, curtailing [sic] its arrangement with Hyundai.\u201d\n31 \n  The biggest problem for Plaintiff is that his theory depends \nentirely on his assertion that Canoo had in fact abandoned its engineering and technology services business prior to the filing of the S -1 registration statement, but Plaintiff\u2019 s complaint does not \ncontain factual content that allows the Court to draw that inference.\n32  Plaintiff points to the fact that Canoo announced in \nMarch 2021 that it had decided to \u201c de-emphasiz[e] \u201d its engineering \nand technology services business and that its agreement with Hyundai was \u201c on hold.\u201d\n33  But that doesn\u2019 t suggest that either of \nthose thi ngs had been decided before the S -1 was filed in January \n2021.     \nPlaintiff also points to the fact that Canoo revealed in March \n2021 that it did not record any revenue for its engineering and \ntechnology services business for Q4 2020.  According to Plaint iff, \nthat suggests that Canoo abandoned that business even before the \nbeginning of Q4 2020.  I disagree.  As Defendants point out, the same S -1 filing on which Plaintiff relies also explained to \nshareholders that, under GAAP, Canoo recognized revenue only when it \u201c satisfie[d] the performance obligations \u201d of an engineering \nservices contract.\n34  And while the S -1 stated that its engineering \nand technology services business was \u201c supportive of a projected \n \n30 (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17 \u201321; D.I. 39, Ex. 13 at 174, 181.)  \n \n31 (D.I. 1 \u00b6 83. ) \n \n32 The plausibility standard is not akin to a \u201cprobability requirement,\u201d but it asks for more \nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.   Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).   \n \n33 (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 112\u2013113.)  \n \n34 (D.I. 44- 1, Ex. 1 at F -33.) \n 9 \n $120 million of revenue in 2021\u201d  there was nothing to su ggest that \nCanoo was expecting to record revenue in that business in Q4 \n2020.35   \n  \nPlaintiff points out that Canoo had recorded revenue in its \nengineering and technology services business earlier in 2020.  According to Plaintiff, the fact that Canoo recor ded zero revenue in \nQ4 after booking revenue in the first three quarters leads to a \nplausible inference that the company had \u201c abandoned\u201d  that business \nprior to Q4.     \nI disagree.  Notwithstanding the S -1\u2019s projection of $120 \nmillion in service revenue for 2021, that same S -1 filing disclosed \nthat the company had only recorded $2.55 million in service revenue in the first three  quarters of 2020 and that all of that revenue related \nto a single performance ob ligation, which had been satisfied in July \n2020 when the company had provided the final report to the customer.  Contrary to the picture Plaintiff is trying to paint, this is not a situation where a company had a steady flow of cash coming in the door for a particular business that abruptly stopped.   \n  \nAnd there are no other allegations suggesting that the board \nhad discussed at any time prior to the S -1 the de -emphasis of the \nengineering services business or putting the relationship with Hyundai on hold.   \n  \nIn short, I agree with Defendants that the co mplaint fails to \nplead facts supporting Plaintiff \u2019s assertion that Canoo had \nabandoned its engineering services business or Hyundai opportunity \nat the time of the January 2021 S -1.  Plaintiff \u2019s breach of fiduciary \nduty claim is based entirely on that asser tion and there are \ninsufficient pleaded facts to support it.  For that reason, the complaint fails to demonstrate that at least three  additional board \nmembers face a substantial likelihood of liability on Plaintiff\u2019 s \nbreach of fiduciary duty claim.   \n  \nDuring the hearing, Plaintiff agreed that his argument in \nsupport of demand futility on his unjust enrichment claim rises or falls with his argument about demand futility on his breach of fiduciary duty claim.  \n  \nPlaintiff has failed to plead particularized fa cts showing that \ndemand should be excused as futile.  The complaint should therefore be dismissed.   \n \n35 (D.I. 39, Ex. 13 at 174.)  10 \n   \nI have carefully considered the remaining arguments made \nby the parties and have determined that they do not warrant further \ndiscussion in light of the conclusions already stated.  In other words, I do not need to reach and therefore won\u2019 t spend additional valuable \nCourt time and resources addressing Defendants \u2019 additional \narguments in support of dismissal, but I will say that there are other meritorious b ases for dismissing and/or declining to exercise \njurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019 s claims.  \n \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B),(C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.   Any \nobjections to the Report and Recommendation shall be filed within fourteen days and limited to \nten pages.  Any response shall be filed within fourteen days thereafter and limited to ten pages.  The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo review in the district court.   \nThe parties are directed to the Court\u2019s \u201cStanding Order for Objections Filed Under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72,\u201d dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which can be found on the Court\u2019s website.  \nIt is FURTHER ORDERED that if Plaintiff objects to any part of this Report & \nRecommendation, Plaintiff shall accompany his objection with a one -page letter to the Court \nsetting forth whether he intends to amend his pleading if the Court adopts thi s Report & \nRecommendation and why that amendment would not be futile.  Defendants may file a one -\npage response letter at the same time as their responses to Plaintiff\u2019s objections.  \n \n \nDated:  June 21, 2022     ___________________________________ \n       The Honorable Jen nifer L.
