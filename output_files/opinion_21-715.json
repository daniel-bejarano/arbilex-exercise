It involves a prisoner \u2019s death  and her mother\u2019s quest for justice. \nBut all litigants , no matter their suffering, must comply with the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. Here, the mother\u2019s  lawyer did not : he failed to serve  some defendants  \nproperly under Delaware law.  So I dismiss the claims against those defendants with-\nout prejudice.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nOn this motion to dismiss I take the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true. In \nOctober 2018, Tiffany Reeves was arrested for not paying  $80 in court fines. Compl. , \nD.I. 1-1 \u00b6 19. She was taken to a Delaware jail, where a nurse  evaluated her the next \nmorn ing. Id. \u00b6 20. She told the nurse  about her long struggle with heroin , her gastric -\nbypass surgery, and her ongoing  \u201cstomach issues. \u201d Id. \nLater that day, two nurses attended to Reeves, presumably because she  com-\nplained of stomach pains. Id. \u00b6 21. They gave her ibuprofen, even though medical staff \nhad forbidden it a year earlier \u201cdue to [her] gastric bypass.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 14.  \nThe next day, a nurse  noted that Reeves  was restless, irritable, and suffering from \n\u201cGI\u201d pains. D.I. 1-1 \u00b6 22. That  evening, she got a new cellmate who noticed that she  \nwas unresponsive . Id. \u00b6 23. \nThe next morning, the cellmate found Reeves dead. Id. \u00b6 23. The medical examiner \nconcluded  that she had died from an irregular heartbeat, possibly caused by drug \nwithdrawal. Id. \u00b6 25. 3 Reeves is survived by her mother, who now sues the jail\u2019s healthcare provider and \nseveral Delaware corrections officials. She says they failed to provide medical care to \nher daughter, thereby violating the  Eighth Amendment . The Delaware corrections \nofficials  (not the provider)  now move to dismiss, arguing that Reeves\u2019s lawyer failed \nto serve them properly and that the complaint does not state a  legal  claim . Because I \nagree on the first score, I need  not address the second. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5 ).  \nII. THE MOTHER \u2019S LAWYER NEVER SERVED THE DEFENDANTS  \nThe prison officials fault Reeves\u2019s mother for failing  to serve  (notify) them properly \nof this suit . D.I. 4 at 10 \u201314. The mother, they note, sued them in Delaware state court \nin October 2020. See D.I. 1 -1. Under Delaware law,  she had 120 days to serve them  \nwith the complaint.  Del. Super. Ct. R. 4(j). And because they  count  as \u201cofficer[s] of the \nstate,\u201d she  also had t o serve Delaware\u2019s Attorney General, her Chief Deputy, or the \nState Solicitor. Del. Code. Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7  3103(c).  \nThe mother\u2019s  lawyer shirked both requirements. He served the prison officials two  \nmonths late.  D.I. 5, at 5. To boot, he neglected to serve the Attorney General, her \nChief Deputy, or the State Solicitor. Once in federal court, the lawyer could have \ncured the defect. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1448. He did not. Because he has not shown good cause \nfor these missteps,  I will dism iss this complaint  without prejudice . Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4(m), 12(b)(5) ; accord Petrucelli v. Bohringer & Ratzinger, 46 F.3d 1298, 1305\u2013 06 (3d \nCir. 1995) . The mother  parries that the defendants  waived their right to proper ser-\nvice. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4( d). Not so. True, the officials removed this case to federal \ncourt. But \u201c[r]emoval does not waive any Rule 12(b) defenses,\u201d including one based 4 on insufficient process. Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. v. Peaslee , 88 F.3d 152, 157 n.4, (2d \nCir. 1996).  \nYet the mother\u2019s  suit is not sunk . First, the healthcare provider remains. Second, \nshe can revive her claims against the corrections officials by serving them again. Be-\nfore her lawyer does so, he should consult  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.  \n* * * * * \nThis tragic suit makes serious allegations about an inmate\u2019s mistreatment in jail. \nIt deserves equally serious lawyering. But  the mother\u2019s  lawyer fell short. He failed to \nserve the defendants  properly .  \nConsidering  those errors, I  dismiss  these  claims  with out prejudice . The mother \ncan refile. If she does, she must perfect service  and detail the acts or omissions that \nled to her daughter\u2019s lamentable death .  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nJANINE GROSSNICKLE , \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n CONNECTIONS COMMUNITY  \nSUPPORT PROGRAMS, INC. , PERRY \nPHELPS, MARC RICHMAN, ROBERT \nMAY  \nDefendant s. \n No. 1:21- cv-00715- SB \n \nORDER  \n1. I GRANT  Perry Phelps, Robert May, and Marc Richman \u2019s motion to dismiss . \nD.I. 3 . I dismiss all claims against those defendants  without prejudice.  \n2. I ORDER  Christofer C. Johnson, counsel for Grossnickle, to give her a copy of \nthis opinion, have her sign a letter confirming receipt, and file that letter by  \nFebruary 28, 2022.  \n \nDated: January 28, 2022    ____________________________________ \n      UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n"}
