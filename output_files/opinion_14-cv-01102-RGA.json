Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore me is Defendant s\u2019 motion for attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285.  (D.I. 218).  I \nhave considered the parties\u2019 briefing.  (D.I. 219, 224, 227).  For the following reasons, I will \nGRANT Defendants\u2019  motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff  M2M sued the Sierra Defendants for infringement of  U.S. Patent No. 8,648,717 \n(\u201cthe \u2019717 patent\u201d) on August 26, 2014.  (D.I. 1).  M2M subsequently assigned all patent rights to Blackbird , who I ordered joined as Plaintiff in this  action on June 21, 2017.  ( D.I. 50; D.I. \n234).   \nBetween  the filing of M2M\u2019s complaint and  the dispositive motions , the \u2019717 Patent  \nclaims  were whittled down from thirty to three.  A series of inter partes  reviews (\u201cIPRs\u201d) \ninvalidated claims 1 -24 and 29. (D.I. 167- 1, Ex. B at 64; D.I. 167- 1, Ex. C. at 62).  I found \nClaims 28 and 30 invalid for indefiniteness at the claim construction phase.  (D.I. 140 at 10).  Thus, by the summary judgment stage  of the case, only claims 25 to  27 were at issue.  ( See D.I. \n203 at 4). \nOn December 4, 2020, a magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation \nrecommending I grant -in-part Sierra\u2019s motion for summary judgment.  (D.I. 203).  In short, the \nReport recommended that I grant summary judgment of non- infringement, but  deny summary \njudgment of invalidity.  I adopted much of the Report, but sustained Sierra\u2019s objection to the Report\u2019s finding that collateral estoppel did not apply to claims 25 -27.  (D.I. 213 at 7).\n1  Thus, I \n \n1 The collateral estoppel issue was one on which reasonable minds could differ, as there was a \nsplit of authority in district court decisions interpreting Federal Circuit caselaw.   3 \n granted summary judgment of non- infringement and invalidity.  On May 19, 2021, I issued a \nfinal judgment in the case.  (D.I. 231).  There has been no appeal.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nThe Patent Act provides, \u201cThe court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney \nfees to the prevailing party.\u201d  35 U.S.C . \u00a7 285.  Under the statute there are two basic \nrequirements: (1) that the case is \u201cexceptional\u201d and (2) that the party seeking fees is a \u201cprevailing \nparty.\u201d  The Supreme Court defined an \u201cexceptional\u201d case as \u201csimply one that stands out from others with r espect to the substantive strength of a party\u2019s litigating position (considering both \nthe governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was \nlitigated.\u201d  Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 554 (2014).  \n\u201cDistrict courts may determine whether a case is \u2018exceptional\u2019 in the case -by-case exercise of \ntheir discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.\u201d  Id.   The Supreme Court has \nprovided a non- exclusive list of factors for district courts to consider in deciding whether a case \nis exceptional, including frivolousness, deterrence, motivation, and objective unreasonableness in the factual and legal components of the suit.  Id.  at 554 n.6.   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nPlaintiffs do not contest that S ierra is the prevailing party on the merits .  (See D.I. 224 ).  \nThe only issue is whether this case is exceptional.  Sierra asserts that it is  for several reasons.  \nSierra\u2019s most weighty contention is that Plaintiffs relied on \u201cmeritless claim constructions\u201d in \nsupport of their  infringement position.  (D.I. 219 at 12).  I agree.   \nThe three asserted patent claims require a programmable communicator device that can \ncontrol the dat a transmitted between at least two devic es.  (D.I. 140 at 1).  After a  Markman \nhearing, I construed the claim term , \u201cnumbers to which the programmable communicator device 4 \n is configured to and permitted to send outgoing wireless transmissions\u201d as \u201cthe exclusive set of \nnumbers to which the program mable communicator is limited to send any outgoing wireless \ntransmissions.\u201d  ( Id. at 13 ).  I explained in the Markman  memorandum, \u201cThe[] uses of the \npatented invention involve limited and quick communications.  These uses do not suggest that broader communication options, let alone the ability to dial a number or connect to an IP address \nnot already programmed into the device, are contemplated by the patent.\u201d  ( Id. at 14).  I further \nexplained, \u201cThe patent does not support the construction that \u2018the e xclusive set of numbers to \nwhich the programmable communicator is limited to\u2019 sending outgoing wireless transmissions only limits a \u2018particular type\u2019 of transmission but does not limit transmissions of a different type.\u201d  ( Id. at 13).  In short, the claime d device could only send wireless transmissions  to the \n\u201cexclusive set of numbers.\u201d    \nPlaintiffs \u2019 opening expert report on infringement asserted to the contrary, \u201c\u2018the exclusive \nset of numbers\u2019  to which the device is permitted to send outgoing wireless transmissions is not \nevery number the device can call. Rather, they are \u2018numbers\u2019 that are included in transmissions authenticated by having a coded number and stored[.] \u201d  (D.I. 167 -1, Ex. F at 40- 41).  This flatly \ncontradicts my claim construction memorandum , where I explained that the patent did not \ncontemplate \u201cbroader communication options\u201d such as dialing  numbers or connecting to IP \naddresses \u201cnot already programmed\u201d ( that is, coded and stored ) on the device.   (D.I. 140 at 14).   \nPlaintiffs  relied on this  expert opinion in their opposition to summary judgment  and \nrested  their infringement arguments upon a distinction between  \u201cauthenticated numbers\u201d and \n\u201cun-authenticated numbers .\u201d  (D.I. 177 at 24- 25).  According to Plaintiffs, the \u201cexclusive set of \nnumbers \u201d only included authenticated numbers, and \u201cunrelated outgoing data calls are not \nauthenticated or stored and thus fall outside the scope of the Asser ted Claims .\u201d  (Id. at 25 ).  This 5 \n argument disregards the claim construction itself, which limits \u201cany outgoing wireless \ntransmissions\u201d to \u201cthe exclusive set of numbers .\u201d  (D.I. 148 at 3).   Plaintiffs\u2019 argument further \ndisregards the Markman memorandum, whi ch clearly stated that there are no sub -types of \ntransmissions  which are not limited to the exclusive set of numbers.  (D.I. 140 at 13).  Rather, I \nagreed with Defendants  \u201cthat all outbound transmissions must have numbers that are \nauthenticated and on the list.\u201d  ( Id.).  Finally, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument  disregards the purpose  of the \ninvention.  As I explained in my claim construction opinion, \u201cThe point of the invention in the mobile phone context, as set out in the specification, is to create a restricted- use mobile phone \nfor a child to prevent \u2018uncontrolled calling.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 140 at 13- 14).  Plaintiffs \u2019 argu ment  that a \ndevice intended to prevent \u201cuncontrolled calling\u201d by a child could make \u201cunauthenticated\u201d outgoing texts or calls  is contrary to the purpose of the invention and wholly unsupported by my \nclaim construction opinion.  (D.I. 177 at 26).   \nI therefore find Plaintiffs\u2019 infringement position objectively baseless.  \u201c While an adverse \nclaim construction generally cannot, alone, form the basis for an exceptional case finding, . . . a party cannot assert baseless infringement claims and must continually assess the soundness of pending infringement claims, especially after an adverse claim construction. \u201d  Taurus IP, LLC v. \nDaimlerChrysler Corp. , 726 F.3d 1306, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2013) .  After my claim construction \norder, Plaintiffs had the option of stipul ating  to non -infringement and appealing the adverse \nclaim construction.  Alternately, Plaintiffs could have dropped the case.  Instead, Plaintiffs unreasonably prolonged litigation by asserting an infringement position that was contrary to the claim construction.  I find that this renders the c ase exceptional.  \nIn reply to Sierra\u2019s motion for attorney fees, Plaintiffs insist that their infringement \npositions were \u201csupported and reasonable.\u201d  (D.I. 224 at 5 ).  They further explain that the 6 \n offending summary judgment argument  was an \u201calternative\u201d argument in response to Sierra\u2019s \nexpert testing, which they believed to be \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d   (Id. at 6, 15 ).  In response to Sierra\u2019s \nevidence of noninfringement  at summary judgment , Plaintiffs had the burden of producing \nevidence to show a genuine dispute  of material fact .  At summary judgment, \u201cM2M [did] not cite \nto any evidence in the record that suggests that the Accused Products can only make outgoing \ntransmissions to an exclusive set of numbers consistent with the claim limitation[.]\u201d  (D.I. 213 at 3-4).  Plaintiffs instead attacked Sierra\u2019s expert \u2019s methodology and alternately advance d an \nargument that flatly contradicted my claim construction.  E ven if Plaintiffs had succeeded on \ntheir argument about Sierra\u2019s expert testimony, they still would have failed to meet their burden of proof  becaus e their  \u201cexclusive set of numbers\u201d argument was meritless and they failed to offer \nany other evidence that the accused products infringed.  Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs  \nneedlessly prolonged litigation by asserting baseless arguments.  \nPlaintiffs also argue  that they were not on notice that their  infringement position was \nbaseless.  (D.I. 2 24 at 4 -5).  I disagree.  I issued the Markman memorandum on claim \nconstruction on November 26, 2019.  (D.I. 140).  At that point, Plaintiffs had access to discovery \nfrom an earlier case along with some  discovery from the case at hand.  (D.I. 219 at 4).  Sierra\u2019s \nJanuary 13, 2020 Supplemental  Response s to Blackbird\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories state d:  \nIn the accused products, even if the facility lock feature in the SIM card is \nenabled, the accused products are still able to send data transmissions to a remote server. Because the accused products can still send data transmissions to the remote server, the [ Fixed Dialing Number  phonebook] is not an exclusive set of \nnumbers to which the programmable communicator is limited to send any outgoing wireless transmissions.  \n (D.I. 220- 1, Ex. C at 13).  Sierra  also sent Plaintiffs a notice letter on January 29, 2020 \nexplaining that Sierra\u2019s  products could transmit data to numbers or addresses not stored in the \ndevice.  (D.I. 220- 1, Ex. B at 3).  At this point, Plaintiffs knew about the adverse claim 7 \n construction and w ere on notice that Sierra\u2019s products did not meet the \u201cexclusive set of \nnumbers\u201d claim limitation.   \nSierra requests attorney fees from at least the date of the Markman memorandum.  (D.I. \n219 at 16).  \u201cAt that point,\u201d Sierra argues, \u201cPlaintiffs had relevant evidence demonstrating that \nSierra could not possibly infringe claims 25- 27 and that claims 25- 27 were invalid based on the \nfindings in the IPR Final Written Decisions.\u201d  ( Id.).  For the following reasons, I will instead \naward  attorney fees from the date of Sierra\u2019s January 29, 2020 notice letter.   \nFirst, I do not find, as Sierra argues, that Plaintiffs\u2019 invalidity argument merits attorney \nfees.  Plaintiffs\u2019 invalidity argument was a reasonable position .  The magistrate judge \nrecommended I deny summary judgment of invalidity.  The issue was one on which reasonable \nminds could differ.  Thus, the invalidity argument was not objectively baseless.   \nSecond, there is no conduct prior to the  Markman memorandum that renders this case \nexceptional .  Sierra argues  that some of Plaintiffs \u2019 conduct prior to claim construction  renders \nthis case exceptional because Plaintiffs  engaged in vexatious litigation tactics.  ( Id. at 14).  Sierra \ncites recalcitrant deponents , Plaintiffs\u2019 production of approximately one hundred documents after \nthe close of discovery, Plaintiffs\u2019  failure to disclose relevant evidence and arguments prior to \nexpert reports, and Blackbird\u2019s tactics in other litigation.  ( Id. at 14 -15).2  Plaintiffs contest \nSierra\u2019s chara cterization of events and offer their own side of the story.  (D.I. 224 at 17- 18).  \nRegarding the discovery conduct and expert reports, Sierra should have  brought \u2014and at times \ndid bring\u2014issues before the court as they arose.  For instance, I considered Pla intiffs\u2019 failure to \ndisclose relevant evidence and arguments prior to expert reports and allowed Sierra to submit a \n \n2 Sierra describes additional conduct in its statement of facts .  I address only those events that \nSierra relies upon in its argument section.   8 \n supplemental report.  (D.I. 172).  I will not look to Blackbird\u2019s conduct in other litigation to \nsupport a finding of vexatious litigation t actics in the case at hand.  Sierra has not made a \nshowing of vexatious litigation tactics and therefore is not entitled to fees prior to the Markman memorandum. \nFinally, w hile Plaintiffs arguably had notice of their weak litigation position from the \ntime of my Markman memorandum, I do not believe that the clock started running on that date .  \nAfter an adverse claim construction, a reasonable litigant would take time to reevaluate their infringement positions and to determine next steps.  I think that  at the  time of Sierra\u2019s January \n29, 2020 notice letter, Plaintiffs should have been aware that their litigating position was exceptionally weak.  Thus,  I will award Sierra attorney fees  for the period of time  after Sierra\u2019s \nJanuary 29, 2020 notice letter .\n3   \nI will not, however, award Sierra expert fees.  Sierra cites MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & \nJohnson for the proposition that I can grant expert fees on a Section 285 motion.  (D.I. 219 at 15 (citing 664 F.3d 907 (Fed. Cir. 2012)) ).  An award of expert fees is a sanction in excess of the \nstatute and \u201cis reserved for cases where the district court makes a finding of fraud or bad faith whereby the very temple of justice has been defiled.\u201d  644 F.3d at 921 (cleaned up).  On this record, I cannot and do not make a finding of fraud or of bad faith.  Sierra has not shown such a level of misconduct .  I will therefore not award expert fees.  \n   \n \n3 At the time of the motion for attorney fees, Sierra estimated that its attorney fees were about \n$530,000 (D.I. 219 at 17), but the starting date for that estimate appears to be November 26, \n2019, the date of the Markman memorandum ( id. at 9).  9 \n IV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will issue.  The parties will be asked to submit a joint status report \nincluding a stipulation as to the amount of attorney fees.  In the absence of agreement, Sierra should file a motion within twenty -one days of the submission of the status report.
