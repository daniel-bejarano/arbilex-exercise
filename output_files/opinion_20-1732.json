JOHNSON,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      : \n v.     : Civil Action No. 20 -1732 -RGA  \n      : Superior Court of the State of   \nC/O TIMOTHY BRADY, et al.,    : Delaware in and for New Castle County   \n      : Case No. N20C -11-146 AML  \n  Defendants.    :  \n \nMEMORANDUM  \n \n 1. Introduction.  Plaintiff Marcus J. Johnson, a former  inmate at James T. \nVaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna, Delaware , filed this action pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C.  \u00a7 1983 in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle \nCounty.  (D.I. 1 -1 at 4- 12).  Plaintiff has since been released from prison.  (D.I. 35). \nPlaintiff appears pro se  and was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis  by the \nSuperior Court .  (D.I. 1-2 at 5).   Before the Court are Plaintiff \u2019s request for counsel  and \nmotion to compel discovery.  (D.I. 21, 30).   \n 1. Request for Counsel .  Plaintiff requests counsel on the grounds that he \nis unable to afford counsel , the issues are complex, he has extremely limited law library \naccess due to his incarceration and work release, he has unsuccessfully sought \nretained counsel, his case has merit, and he has limited knowledge of the law.  (D.I. 21 ).   \n2. A pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis  has no constitutional or \nstatutory right to representation by counsel.   See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, \n192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. G race, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).  However, 2 \n representation by counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a \nfinding that a plaintiff \u2019s claim has arguable merit in fact and law.  Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.  \n3. After passing this threshold i nquiry, the Court should consider a number of \nfactors when assessing a request for counsel.  Factors to be considered by a court in \ndeciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the \nmerits of the plaintiff\u2019 s claim; (2 ) the plaintiff \u2019s ability to present his or her case \nconsidering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon \nhim or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to which factual investigation i s required and the plaintiff \u2019s ability to pursue such \ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiff \u2019s capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and \n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony.  See Montgomery v. P inchak , 294 F.3d 492, 498- 99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at \n155-56.  The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative.  Tabron, 6 F.3d \nat 157.   \n4. I have reviewed the docket in this case as well as Plaintiff\u2019s filings.  To \ndate, Plaintiff has ably represented himself in this matter.   In addition, the  issues are  \nnot complex.  Finally, Plaintiff  is no longer incarcerated which should facilitate his ability \nto prosecute his case.   Upon consideration of the entire record, I have concluded that \ncounsel is not warrant ed.  Therefore, the Court will deny Plaintiff \u2019s request for counsel \nwithout prejudice.    \n5. Motion to Compel .   Plaintiff moves to compel Defendants to respond to \ndiscovery served upon them on July 23, 2021 and September 3, 2021.  (D.I. 30).   \nDefendants oppose the motion on the grounds that Plaintiff prematurely sought 3 \n discovery before their answer was due.   (D.I. 31). The opposition is well- taken.  \nDefendants had until November 29, 2021 to file their answer.  Plaintiff sought discovery \nwell-before that time.  Therefore, Plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel will be denied.  \n  6. Conclusion.  Based upon the above discussion, the Court will: (1)  will \ndeny without prejudice Plaintiff\u2019s request for counsel (D.I. 21); and (2) deny Pl aintiff\u2019s \nmotion to compel  (D.I. 30).  A separate order shall issue.      \n          \n     _/s/ Richard G.
