R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3);  Brown v. Astrue , 649 F.3d 193, 195 (3d Cir. \n2011);  \nNOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that:  2 \n\u00a01. Plaintiff\u2019s Objections (D.I. 129) are OVERRULED , Judge Burke\u2019s Report (D.I. \n127) is  ADOPTED , Defendant\u2019s motion (D.I. 44) is GRANTED , and Plaintiff\u2019s request for \nleave to amend is GRANTED .  \n 2. Plaintiff objects to the Re port\u2019s recommendation regarding the patent eligibility of \nrepresentative claim 13 of U. S. Patent No. 10,354,296 (the \u201c\u2019296 pa tent\u201d); representative claim \n19 of U.S. Patent No. 10,445,794 (the \u201c\u2019794 patent\u201d); representative claim 18 of U.S. Patent No. \n10,180,966 (the \u201c\u2019966 patent\u201d); and representative claim 16 of U.S. Patent No. 8,918,312 \n(the \u201c\u2019312 patent\u201d).  Reputation does not object to the Report\u2019s tr eatment of those claims as \nrepresentative of the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit.  The objections may fairly be \ncharacterized as coming within four cat egories, and each la cks merit.    \n 3. First, Reputation argues that at Alice step one, the Report fa ils to consider the \npatents\u2019 character as a whole in determining whether the claims are directed to an abstract idea.  \n(See Objs. at 5-6)  More specifi cally, Plaintiff appears to ta ke issue with the Report\u2019s order  of \nanalysis, asserting that Judge Burke \u201cbegan w ith the claims\u201d and \u201cworked backwards\u201d to find \nsupport in the specification for the conclusion that the claims are di rected to abstract ideas.  ( Id. \nat 6)  As Birdeye notes, however, the focus of the \u00a7 101 inquiry is indi sputably on the language \nof the claims themselves.  ( See Resp. at 2-3)  Accordingly, it is sensible to begin the analysis \nthere.  There is also no support for the notion that the Report \u201cpredetermined\u201d that the claims are \ndirected to abstract ideas or \u201cbackfilled that conclusion with re ference to the specification.\u201d  \n(Objs. at 4, 6)  Instead, to determine what each representative claim is \u201cdirected to,\u201d the Report \ncarefully considers the language of the claims , including by identifyi ng the claims\u2019 specific \ncomponent parts.  ( See, e.g. , Report at 5, 13, 20, 26-27)  In so doing, the Report does not simply \ndefer to Defendant\u2019s proposed abstract ideas.  With respect to the \u2019966 patent, for example, the 3 \n\u00a0Report concludes that, while some  of the claim language overlaps with Birdeye\u2019s abstract idea, \n\u201cthere is also more to the claim.\u201d  ( Id. at 20)  \n 4. Next, as the Federal Circuit instructs,  the Report turns to the specification for \nfurther guidance.  See Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp. , 822 F.3d 1327, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2016) \n(\u201c[T]he \u2018directed to\u2019 inquiry applies a stage-one filter to claims, considered in light of the \nspecification, based on whether th eir character as a whole is directed to excluded subject \nmatter.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fo r each of the four patents-in-suit, the Report \nconsiders the specification\u2019s expl anations of the probl ems the patents are designed to solve and \nsearches for descriptions of technolo gical solutions to those problems.  ( See, e.g. , Report at 5-6, \n13-14, 20-21, 27)  With respect to the \u2019794 patent, for example, th e Report investigates portions \nof the specification that \u201chint at what could be a more narrow focus\u201d beyond the abstract idea \nproposed by Defendant.  ( Id. at 14-15)  Only after carefully and methodically considering both \nthe claim language and specification,  as to each representative claim, does the Report conclude \nthat the claims are directed to abstract ideas,  rather than to improvements in online reputation \nmanagement (\u201cORM\u201d) system technology, as Reputation instead contends.  ( See, e.g. , Objs. at 4-\n5)  The Report correctly concludes that the representative claims are directed to the abstract ideas \nit articulates.1  Such conclusions are well-reasoned and based, as they must be, on a \nconsideration of the claims \u2019 character as a whole.  See Enfish , 822 F.3d at 1335.  \n 5. Second, Plaintiff contends that the Report dismisses th e well-pled allegations in \nthe FAC concerning the context of the patents- in-suit and resolves factual disputes in \nDefendant\u2019s favor.  ( See Objs.  at 6-7)  The Court disagrees.  Taking representative claim 13 of \n\u00a0\n 1 Given the detailed reasoning supporting th ese conclusions provi ded in the Report ( see, \ne.g., Report at 4-8, 12-15, 19-23, 26-28), which the Cour t adopts, it is unnecessary to address the \nstep one inquiry in further detail. 4 \n\u00a0the \u2019296 patent as an example, the Report cons iders the patent\u2019s cont ext, including the FAC\u2019s \narticulation of the problems the patent aimed to solve and how it purported to solve them.  ( See \nReport at 6-7 & n.5)  The Report rejects the notion that such context conf ers patent eligibility, \nexplaining that \u201cjust because use of a claimed method might lead to a helpful, or even novel, \noutcome does not necessarily mean that  the claim is patent eligible.\u201d  ( Id. at 7 n.5)  The Report \nalso considers the allegation in the FAC that the \u2019296 patent provides a solution \u201crooted in \ncomputer technology\u201d (FAC \u00b6 34), as well as argum ent from Reputation\u2019s counsel that the patent \nis \u201cclearly trying to solve tec hnological problems\u201d (R eport at 7).  It de termines that those \nassertions are conclusory and lack support from the cl aim language itself.  ( See id.  at 7 n.5)  With \nrespect to the other three patents-in-suit, the Re port does not simply \u201cdismiss\u201d the allegations in \nthe FAC or resolve them uncritically in Birdeye\u2019s favor.  Rather, it considers them and concludes \nthey are conclusory and unsupported by the intrin sic record, particular ly the claim language \nitself.  ( See Resp. at 4-6)  As articulated in WhitServe LLC v. Dropbox, Inc. , 2019 WL 3342949, \nat *7 (D. Del. July 25, 2019), aff\u2019d , 854 F. App\u2019x 367 (Fed. Cir. 2021), such conclusory \nallegations are insufficient to establish a factua l dispute, much less an inventive concept.   \n 6. The Report also considers the patents\u2019  prosecution histor ies but finds them \ninsufficient to establish a factual dispute at Alice step two.  ( See, e.g. , Report at 10-11)  For \nexample, during prosecution of  the \u2019296, \u2019794, and \u2019312 patent s, although the Examiner \nultimately found the claims-at-issu e patent eligible, the Examiner  provided little analysis to \nsupport that conclusion.  ( See id. at 11, 16, 28-29)  Additionally, the Report notes that the aspect \nof the \u2019296 patent claims the Ex aminer pointed to as unconventiona l \u201cappears to be little more \nthan a re-statement of the abstract idea at issue.\u201d  ( Id. at 11)  With respec t to the \u2019966 patent, \nalthough the Examiner advised the applicant that it could overcome a \u00a7 101 rejection by 5 \n\u00a0amending the claims to include  \u201can automated element for pr eliminary coding,\u201d the Report \ncorrectly notes that simply automating a claim \u201cadds nothing to the eligibility calculus.\u201d  ( Id. at \n23-24)  Accordingly, the Report di d not err in concluding that th e Examiner\u2019s statements failed \nto establish a factual dispute, or an inventive concept, at Alice step two. \n 7. Third, Reputation alleges the Report sua sponte raises claim construction issues \nand resolves them in Defendant\u2019s favor.  ( See Objs. at 7)  The Report doe s neither.  In its effort \nto locate limitations in the intrinsic record that may confer patent eligibil ity, the Report notes that \n\u201cif the claim was even arguably limited in these ways, Plaintiff had ampl e opportunity to tell the \nCourt this.  It could have said so in its answering brief, or ar gued this during the hearing.  It \ncould have proposed a construction . . . .  But it did not.\u201d  (Report at 15)  The Report does not \n\u201cresolve\u201d any claim construction issues; nor does it promise that successful claim construction \narguments were even available to Plaintiff.  Instead, the Report\u2019s references to claim \nconstruction reflect instances in which the Report is searching for something  that may confer \neligibility, and, in the absence of \u2013 for example \u2013 a proposed  claim construction, it finds nothing. \n 8. For example, in searching for an inventive concept at Alice step two, the Report \nnotes that, with respect to the \u2019296 and \u2019794 pate nts, Reputation makes lit tle attempt to explain \nwhich aspect of the representa tive claims is inventive.  ( See id.  at 9, 15)  As to claim 13 of the \n\u2019296 patent, the Report considers Pl aintiff\u2019s reference to the clai med \u201cfollow-up engine,\u201d but is \nnot persuaded it amounts to an inventive concept.  ( See id.  at 9)  The Report notes that the \nspecification refers to the follow-up engine \u201conl y in terms of the resu lts it generates\u201d and \nobserves that Plaintiff does not propose a claim constr uction that would sugge st otherwise (i.e., \nby requiring particularized softwa re or hardware limitations).  ( Id.)  As to claim 19 of the \u2019794 \npatent, Reputation\u2019s counsel offered a cons truction for the claimed term \u201cdynamically 6 \n\u00a0determining\u201d ( id. at 17), but the Court agre es with the Report that, even applying Plaintiff\u2019s \nproposed construction \u2013 \u201chaving th e system determine based on th e input where the user should \nbe directed\u201d \u2013 the claim elem ent adds nothing amounting to an  improvement in computer \ntechnology ( id.).   \n 9. Fourth, Plaintiff argues the Report do es not recognize the existence of factual \ndisputes at Alice step two that preclude dismissal.  For instance, it points again to the Report\u2019s \ncharacterization of the patent Examiner\u2019s statements during prosecution as conclusory and \nargues the Report\u2019s decision to \u201cdownplay\u201d such stat ements \u201cin effect, resolves factual disputes \nin Birdeye\u2019s favor \u2013 improper at the motion to dismiss stage.\u201d  (O bjs. at 8)  The Court agrees, \nhowever, with the Report that the Examiner\u2019s statem ents do not raise disputes  of fact material to \nthe step two inquiry.  Instead, th ey are conclusory and do not id entify specific, technological \nimprovements covered by the claims th at may provide an inventive concept.2  Further, in noting \nthat Plaintiff did not cite to any expe rt testimony regarding \u00a7 101 in the FAC ( see Report at 11 \nn.9), the Report does not \u201cturn[] Birdeye\u2019s burden on its head and require[] Reputation to prove \n\u00a0\n 2 Plaintiff urges the Court to compare the allegations in the FAC with those made in \nInterDigital Technology Corp. v. Lenovo Holding Co. , C.A. No. 19-1590, which the Court \nconsidered during a \u201c101 Day.\u201d  ( See Objs. at 8 n.2)  In that case, in denying a \u00a7 101 motion to \ndismiss, the Court stated: \u201c[t]he operative first am ended complaint plausibly alleges that each of \nthe six patents has an inventive concept that wa s not routine, conventiona l, and well understood; \nand it does so . . . for example, by citing to per tinent portion[s] of the prosecution histories.\u201d  \nPivital IP LLC v. ActiveCampaign, LLC , 2020 WL 6043919, at *3 (D. Del. Oct. 13, 2020).  Such \na comparison, however, only unders cores the conclusory nature of Reputation\u2019s allegations.  \nWhile InterDigital\u2019s amended comp laint detailed the ra tionale supporting the patent Examiner\u2019s \nconclusions as to eligibility \u2013 including discussion of the sp ecific technological improvements \nover the prior art that the Examiner conc luded provided an inventive concept ( see C.A. No. 19-\n1590 D.I. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 29, 40, 46) \u2013 Reputation\u2019s FAC provide s neither the Examine r\u2019s rationale nor an \narticulation of any concrete, sp ecific technological improvement s that could constitute an \ninventive concept.  Relatedly, the Court is not persuaded that it mu st credit Plaint iff\u2019s speculation \nthat \u201cthe Examiner\u2019s brevity\u201d is indicative of th e Examiner\u2019s purported view  that \u201cthe bases for \nallowance [we]re clear.\u201d   (D.I. 129 at 9)  \n 7 \n\u00a0its patents\u2019 validity\u201d or impose a requirement that a party submit an expert report at this stage \n(Objs. at 9).  Instead, as with  the Report\u2019s discussion of clai m construction, the Report again \nsearches for evidence that coul d support a finding of patent eligibility \u2013 including, perhaps, \nexpert testimony \u2013 a nd finds none.    \n 10. Reputation requests that, if  the Court adopts the Report, as it has, the Court should \ngrant Reputation leave to  amend its FAC.  ( Id.)  Reputation explains that , if permitted, it would \nadd \u201callegations regarding problems surrounding the operation of ORM systems and specific, \nreal-world examples of improvements in ORM systems that practice the patents\u2019 claimed \nadvances.\u201d  ( Id. at 10)  It would also add allegations , and perhaps an expert declaration, to \nunderscore the unconventional nature  of the claimed technology.  ( Id.)  If granted leave to \namend, Plaintiff may also include further co ntext for the Examine r\u2019s allowance during \nprosecution.  ( Id.)  The Court is not persua ded that amendment would be  futile.  Moreover, while \nthis case has been delayed, the Court does not fi nd that Reputation has unduly delayed it.  Nor \nwill Defendant suffer any unfair prejudice from amendment (just additional litigation).  Although \nReputation has had ample opportunity to present allegations supporting pa tent eligibility, the \nCourt believes it is most appropr iate \u2013 considering the totality of circumstances \u2013 to provide \nReputation one final opportunity to  attempt to state a claim.  See generally Realtime Data LLC v. \nReduxio Sys., Inc. , 831 F. App\u2019x 492, 498 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\u201cFactual allegations in a \ncomplaint can suffice to overcome Alice  step 2 and district courts should, as in any civil case, \nfreely grant leave to amend to al lege the necessary facts.\u201d).   \n        ________________________________ \nMarch 30, 2022      HON ORABLE LEONARD P.
