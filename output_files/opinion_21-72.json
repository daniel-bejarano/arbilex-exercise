Hall", "date": "01-05-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nFEDEX SUPPLY CHAIN LOGISTICS AND \nELECTRONICS, INC. , \n \nPlaintiff /Counterclaim Defendant , \n \nv. \n \nVIKING TECHNOLOGIES, LLC , \n \nDefendant /Counterclaim Plaintiff .   \n \n \n C.A. No. 21-72-CFC  \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \n \nPlaintif f FedEx Supply Chain Logistics & Electronics, Inc. (\u201c FSCLE \u201d) filed this action \nseeking  a declaratory judgment that it does not infringe two patents owned by Defendant Viking \nTechnologies, LLC  (\u201cViking\u201d) .  Viking filed counterclaims for infringement of the same two \npatents , but it dismissed them before FSCLE  answered .  FSCLE  contends that Viking\u2019s \ncounterclaims were frivolous , and FSCLE  moves the Court for an award of  attorney\u2019s fees and \nsanct ions against Viking under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11  and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285.  (D.I. 18; \nD.I. 38.)1  I recommend that the Court DENY FSCLE \u2019s motions . \nFSCLE  also seeks to  dismiss its declaratory judgment claim without prejudice  and asks for  \nentry of  \u201cjudgment of non- infringement\u201d of the two patents .  (D.I. 52.)  I recommend that the Court \nGRANT FSCLE\u2019s  motion to dismiss its declaratory judgment claim but DENY its request for \nentry of judgment of non- infringement.  \n  \n \n1 Unless indicated otherwise, all citations are to C.A. No. 21- 72. 2 \n I. BACKGROUND  \nU.S. Patent Nos. 8,888,953 (\u201c\u02bc953 patent\u201d)  and 10,220,537 (\u201c\u02bc537 patent\u201d)  relate to \nmethods of removing damaged glass covers from mobile phone displays so that replacement glass \ncan be attached .  (D.I. 11, Counterclaims \u00b6 19.)  Viking Technologies, LLC (\u201cViking\u201d) is the owner \nby assignment of both patents .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17.)    \nFSCLE  commen ced this action on January 25, 2021.  (D.I. 1.)   To fully understand the \npending disputes , however, we need to go back a little further in time.  On November 9, 2020, t wo \nmonths before FSCLE  filed this action, Viking sued a different entity, FedEx Supply Chain, Inc. \n(\u201cFSC\u201d) , in this Court for infringement of the \u02bc953 and \u02bc537 patents .  (C.A. No. 20-1511- CFC, \nD.I. 1.)  Viking\u2019s Complaint alleged that FSC \u201coperates phone repair and remanufacture facilities\u201d  \nand that FSC violated 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g) by \u201cselling in, offering to sell in, using in, or importing \ninto the United States display assemblies manufactured or otherwise produced using a process that \npractices\u201d methods claimed by the patents .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 26 \u201327, 30\u201331.)   \nOn January 11, 2021, counsel retained by FSC contacted Viking\u2019s attorneys and told them  \nthat FSC  was not a proper defendant in Viking\u2019s infringement action  because FSC was not in the \nbusiness of repairing smartphones .   (D.I. 28 \u00b6 4; D.I. 49 \u00b6 3, Ex. A at 1\u20132; D.I. 8 (Amended \nComplaint)  at 1.)  FSC\u2019s counsel sent a follow -up email on January 18, 2021, requesting that \nViking \u201cfil[e] an amended complaint to name the correct entity, FedEx Supply Chain Logistics and Electronics [FSCLE] .\u201d  (D.I. 49, Ex. A at 1.)  \nOne week l ater, on January 25, 2021, FSCLE filed this action against Viking seeking \ndeclaratory judgment of noninfringement of the \u02bc953 and \u02bc537 patents .  (D.I. 1.)  FSCLE \u2019s \npleadings allege tha t it \u201cexited the display assembly repair business by at least as early as some \ntime in 2018,\u201d  before the issuance of the \u02bc537 patent.  (D.I. 8 \u00b6 \u00b6 18, 24, 30; see also  D.I. 1.)   3 \n FSCLE \u2019s pleadings also  allege  that it did not learn of  the existence  of the \u02bc953 patent  until \nNovember  2020 (when Viking filed suit against FSC) , and it contends  that Viking is  barred under \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(b)2 from obtaining a remedy for any activities FSCLE undertook before exiting \nthe market in 2018.  ( D.I. 8 \u00b6 24.)  \nOn February 12, 2021, Viking answered FSCLE\u2019s  declaratory judgment Complaint .  (D.I. \n7 (Answer to original Complaint); see also  D.I. 11 ( March 5, 2021 Answer to Amended \nComplaint) .)  Viking also asserted counterclaims  of infringement of each of the \u02bc953 and \u02bc537 \npatents  under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g).  (D.I. 7; D.I. 11.)  That same day, Viking filed a notice of \ndismissal of its infringement action against FSC, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n41(a)(1)(A)(i).3  (C.A. No. 20- 1511- CFC, D.I. 13.)  \nOn March 5, 2021, FSCLE  moved to dismiss Viking\u2019s  infringement  counter claims for \nfailure to state a claim.  (D.I. 12.)  That motion was fully briefed .  (D.I. 13; D.I. 14; D.I. 16.)   \nWhile  the motion  to dismiss remained  pending, FSCLE  filed a nother  motion on April 8, \n2021 styled \u201cMotion for Sanctions Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 and the Inherent Powers of the Court.\u201d   (D.I. 18.)   In that motion, FSCLE  contends that Viking failed \nto do an  adequate  presuit investigation of its infringement counterclaims and that those \ncounterclaims are frivolous.  That motion was also fully briefed , and both parties requested oral \nargument .  (D.I. 19; D.I. 23; D.I. 24; D.I. 25; D.I. 27; D.I. 28; D.I. 29; D.I. 30; D.I. 31;  D.I. 32.)   \n \n2 Section 287(b)(2) provides that \u201c[n] o remedies for infringement under section 271(g) \nshall be available with respect to any product in the possession of, or in transit to, the person subject \nto liability under such section before that person had notice of infringement with respect to that \nproduct.\u201d \n \n3 FSC had not yet  answered or otherwise responded to Viking\u2019s Complaint.  4 \n Then, on June 8, 2021, Viking filed  a Notice of Dismissal of its counter claims pursuant to \nRule 41(a)(1)(A)(i), (c).  (D.I. 35.)   Viking\u2019s dismissal of its counterclaims mooted FSCLE\u2019s then-\npending motion to dismiss them .  FSCLE\u2019s Rule 11 motion remained pending .  (D.I. 36.)  \nOn June 22, 2021, FSCLE filed a motion styled \u201cMotion for Declaration of Exceptional \nCase and Award of Attorney Fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285.\u201d  (D.I. 38.)   FSCLE \u2019s motion  contends \nthat it is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d  on Viking\u2019s counterclaim s and that Viking filed frivolous \ncounterclaims without conducting an adequate presuit investigation.  That motion was also fully \nbriefed.  (D.I. 39; D.I. 40;  D.I. 41; D.I. 48; D.I. 49; D.I. 51.)  \nOn Ju ly 14, 2021, FSCLE filed a nother  motion styled \u201cMotion for Voluntary Dismissal \nunder Rule 41(a)(2) and for Entry of Final Judgment under Rules 54 and 58.\u201d  (D.I. 52.)  In that \nmotion, FSCLE seeks not only to voluntarily dismiss its claims for declaratory judgment of \nnoninfringement , but also to obtain a  \u201c[j]udgment of non- infringement  of all claims \u201d of the \u02bc 953 \nand \u02bc537 patents  \u201cin favor of\u201d FSCLE.  That motion was also fully briefed , and FSCLE requested \noral argument .   (D.I. 53; D.I. 54;  D.I. 55.)  \nThe Court heard oral argument on August 20, 2021.  This Report and Recommendation \naddresses all pending motions .  (D.I. 18 (FSCLE\u2019s motion for sanctions) ; D.I. 38 (FSCLE\u2019s motion \nfor attorney\u2019s fees) ; D.I. 52 (FSCLE\u2019s motion to voluntarily dismiss its claims and for judgment \nof noninfringement ).) \nFor the reasons stated below, I recommend  that the Court DENY  FSCLE\u2019s  requests  for \nsanctions and attorney\u2019s fees.  I further recommend that  the Court GRANT  FSCLE\u2019s request to \ndismiss its claims without prejudice but DENY its  request for entry of judgment  of \nnoninfringement. 5 \n II. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Rule 11 Sanctions  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 require s attorne ys to (among other things)  conduct \u201can \ninquiry reasonable under the circumstances\u201d into the law and facts before  filing pleadings  and to \ncertify that the ir claims are n either  legally frivolous, without factual foundation, nor presented for \nan improper purpose .  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) .  Courts  are authorized to  impose sanctions for Rule \n11 violations .  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c).  When deciding whether sanctions are appropriate , courts \nassess whether the challenged conduct  was \u201cobjectively reasonable under the circumstances .\u201d  Ario \nv. Underwriting Members of Syndicate 53, 618 F.3d 277, 297 (3d Cir. 2010)  (quoting Simmerman \nv. Corino, 27 F.3d 58, 62 (3d Cir.  1994) ).   \nThe primary purpose of Rule 11 is to correct litigation abuse , not to authorize \u201cwholesale \nfee shifting \u201d against the party on the losing side of an issue .  Doering v. Union Cty . Bd. of Chosen \nFreeholders , 857 F.2d 191, 194 (3d Cir. 1988)  (quotation omitted) .   Accordingly, Rule 11 \nsanctions should be imposed only \u201cin the \u2018exceptional circumstance\u2019 where a claim or motion is \npatently unmeritorious or frivolous.\u201d  Id. (quotation omitted).  \nB. Fee Shifting  under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 \nSection 285 of Title 35 provides that \u201c[t]he court in exceptional cases may award \nreasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d  The Supreme Court has defined an \u201cexceptional\u201d \ncase as \u201cone that stands out from others with respect to the substantive st rength of a party\u2019s \nlitigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the \nunreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\u201d  Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & \nFitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 554 (2014).  Whether a ca se is exceptional is left to the discretion of \nthe district court, which should make a case -by-case determination based on the totality of the 6 \n circumstances.  Id.  One of the factors to consider in deciding whether a case is exceptional is \n\u201cobjective unrea sonableness (both in the factual and legal components of the case).\u201d  Id. at 554 n. \n6; see also Vehicle Operation Techs. LLC v. Ford Motor Co., No. 13- 539-RGA, 2015 WL \n4036171, at *3 (D. Del. July 1, 2015). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThis action  never even made it to the scheduling order stage .  And it is now over: Viking \nhas dismissed its infringement counterclaims and FSCLE wants  to dismiss its declaratory \njudgment claims.  \n Notwithstanding the  early resolution, FSCL E says that it spent over  $500,000 in attorney\u2019s \nfees and costs in connection with prosecuting and defending the case, and it wants the Court to \nmake Viking pay\u2014under  either Rule 11 or 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285.   \nI recommend that the Court deny FSCLE\u2019s motions for sanctions and attorney\u2019s fees.  \nA. The Court should not impose Rule 11 sanctions . \nI start with FSCLE\u2019s pending motion for  sanctions , which FSCLE  filed before  Viking \ndismissed its infringement counterclaims .  (D.I. 18.)   In it, FSCLE asks the Court to (1) dismiss \nViking\u2019s infringement counterclaims \u201cwith prejudice\u201d and (2) order Viking to pay all of FSCLE\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs expended \u201cin litigating this matter .\u201d  (D.I. 18 (Proposed Order).)   Viking \nvoluntarily dismissed its counterclaims eight weeks after FSCLE filed its Rule 11 motion  (D.I. \n35), but FSCLE says that it will not withdraw  the motion (D.I. 36) .   \nAs an initial matter, I am skeptical of  FSCLE\u2019s request for all of the attorney\u2019s fees and \ncosts it incurred  \u201clitigating this matter \u201d\u2014a matter that FSCLE itself commenced .  Rule 11 \nsanctions \u201cmust be limited to what suffices to deter  repetition of the conduct being challenged ,\u201d \nwhich may include \u201can order directing payment to the movant of part or all of the re asonable 7 \n attorney\u2019s fees and other expense directly resulting from the violation.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(4).  \nThe conduct challenged by FSCLE\u2019s motion is Viking\u2019s assertion of infringement counterclaims , \nso an appropriate sanction  under Rule 11\u2014if any \u2014would be the fees incurred  by FSCLE  \nresponding to those counterclaims before Viking dismissed them.   Fees incurred by FSCLE before \nViking even filed counterclaims surely weren\u2019t \u201cdirectly resulting\u201d from those counterclaims.  And, giv en that Viking\u2019s infringement counterclaims were essentially mirror images of FSCLE\u2019s \nown claims for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement, I \u2019d be disinclined to find that all of the \nfees incurred by FSCLE while the counterclaims were pending  \u201cdirectly resulted\u201d from them .\n4  \nNevertheless , I cannot conclude  that Viking violated  Rule 11.  FSCLE argues that Viking \nfailed to conduct an adequate presuit investigation before asserting counterclaims for infringement of the \u02bc953 and \u02bc537 patents.  If  it had, says FSCLE, Viking would have discovered that FSCLE \nstopped purchasing repaired display assemblies before  the \u02bc537 patent even issued.  FSCLE also \ncontends that Viking failed to adequately investigate whether FSCLE purchased display \nassemblies that were repaired using the patented (as opposed to some other) process.   \nI do not think that Viking\u2019s presuit investigation  was so deficient as to be unreasonable.  \nThe record before the Court reflects that Viking had a basis to believe that FSCLE may have been  \nengaged in infringing conduct .  In response to FSCLE\u2019s Rule 11 motion, Viking submitted the  \ndeclaration of Kevin  Barnett .  (D.I. 24.)  Mr. Barnett  states that  a Viking affiliate  performe d \nsmartphone display assembly repairs for a predecessor of FSCLE  until early 2015.  (Id. \u00b6 6.)  In \n \n4 FSCLE\u2019s Rule 11 motion also cites 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 as a basis for awarding it all of the \nfees it incurred in litigating this matter.  I reject that for a number of reasons, not the least of which \nare set forth in Section III.B, infra. \nThe title of FSCLE\u2019s Rule 11 motion also requested sanctions pursuant to the Court\u2019s \n\u201cinherent authority.\u201d  But FSCLE\u2019s briefs provided no argument as to why an award of sanctions \npursuant to this Court\u2019s inherent power is appropriate.   8 \n Fall 2015, FSCLE approached Mr. Barnett concerning future work, but no deal was ever reached.  \n(Id. \u00b6 7.)  In 2020, Mr. Barnett heard \u201cfrom several individuals in the smartphone and tablet repair \nindustry\u201d that FSCLE was doing smartphone repair work, and a consultant in the industry told \nBarnett that FSCLE was obtaining remanufactured  display assemblies from a company called Re -\nLCD .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9\u201313.)   Viking  also contends  that the most common smartphone  repair involves the \nphone screen ( D.I. 11, Counter claims  \u00b6\u00b6 7, 14), and that the most common method of repairing a \nphone screen is Viking \u2019s patented method.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 34; D.I. 24 \u00b6 15.)   \n FSCLE contends  that, prior to asserting counterclaims, Viking should have further \ninvestigated whether FSCLE was still purchasing display assemblies that were r efurbished using \nthe patented process , but I can\u2019t find on this record that Viking acted unreasonably.  FSCLE has \nnot persuasively explained how Viking could have obtained  conclusive  evidence prior to asserting \nits counterclaims that FSCLE no longer purchased repaired display assemblies.   And, given the \nnature of the patented process \u2014the removal of damaged covers from mobile phone displays so \nthat replacement glass can be attached \u2014the question of w hether  any display assemblies purchased \nby FSCLE were made  using that process  is a fact that seems  unlikely to be discovered  through \ninspection.  Nor does FSCLE explain how Viking could have otherwise learned that information.   \nWhat\u2019s more , the record reflects  that Viking \u2019s counsel  spoke with FSCLE \u2019s counsel before  \n(and after) asserting its counterclaims and requested  evidentiary  support  for FSCLE\u2019s  assertion \nthat it no  longer purchased refurbished display  assemblies .  (D.I. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4, Ex. 1, Ex. 2; D.I. 28 \n\u00b6\u00b6 4\u20136, Ex. 1; D.I. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20137.)   FSCLE  did not provide that  evidence until  May 21, 2021 ( in the 9 \n form of a declaration accompanying its Rule 11 motion reply brief  (D.I. 30 \u00b6 \u00b6 19\u201320; D.I. 37, Ex. \n1),5 and Viking dismissed its counterclaims two weeks later  (D.I. 35).   \nThe question of whether a litigant\u2019s position is factually well  grounded for Rule 11 \npurposes is \u201cfact specific.\u201d  Hoffmann- La Roche Inc. v. Invamed Inc., 213 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. \nCir. 2000)  (citing Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 403 (1990) ).  Under the \ncircumstances here \u2014where  Viking had some basis for believing that FSCLE was engaged in the \naccused conduct , and where  FSCLE has not persua ded the Court that there was much else that \nViking could have or should have done  that would have  demonstrat ed infringement  or \nnoninfringement of Viking\u2019s proc ess patent \u2014I cannot conclude that Viking acted unreasonably in \nasserting its infringement counterclaims .  See id. at 1364 (affirming denial of Rule 11 sanctions \nwhere the plaintiff  was unable to obtain facts showing infringement of their process patents prior \nto filing suit  and dismissed the suit once the defendant provided evidence of noninfringe ment); see \nalso Mary Ann Pensiero, Inc. v. Lingle , 847 F.2d 90, 95 (3d Cir. 1988)  (\u201cA requirement that \ncounsel, before filing a complaint, secure the type of proof necessary to withstand a motion for \nsummary judgment would set a prefiling standard beyond that contemplated by Rule 11.\u201d); Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 11(b) (requiring c ounsel to conduct an inquiry \u201creasonable under the circumstances\u201d).   \nI also reject FSCLE\u2019s contention that Viking\u2019s counterclaims were legally frivolous .  \nFSCLE says that Viking\u2019s  infringement counterclaims are legally deficient for four reasons .  First, \nFSCLE argues  that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(b) bars any damages award against FSCLE because it ceased \nbuying repaired display assemblies in 2018 before it learned of the existence of the pat ents.  \nFSCLE may be right about the law , but that\u2019s of no moment because Viking \u2019s counterclaims  \n \n5 I\u2019m not saying that FSCLE\u2019s refusal to provide early discovery was inappropriate, but it \nis a fact  that the Court may take in to account in determining whether Viking acted reasonably \nunder the circumstances.  10 \n pleaded  that FSCLE continued  to engage in the accused conduct  (and, as explained above, \nViking\u2019s factual investigation was not  unreasonable ).   \nFSCLE \u2019s second, third, and fourth arguments are (2) t hat it  cannot be liable under \u00a7 271(g) \nbecause Viking cannot show that there is \u201cno adequate remedy\u201d against FSCLE\u2019s alleged suppliers \n(who actually repaired the display assemblies ), (3) that the refurbished display assemblies  were \nnot \u201cmade\u201d by a patented process within the meaning of \u00a7  271(g)  because the asserted patents \ncover disassembling a display, not making one , and (4) that the purchased display assemblies are \nexcluded from \u00a7  271(g) because  they were either \u201cmaterially changed by subsequent processes\u201d \nor \u201ca trivial and nonessential component of another product .\u201d  But all of thos e arguments involve \ndisputed legal  and factual issues .  Viking Techs., LLC v. Square Trade Inc., No. 20- 1509, D.I. 46 \nat 8\u20139 (D. Del. Dec. 9, 2021) (concluding that disputes over whether remanufactured display \nassembly was \u201cmade\u201d using the patented process and had not been \u201cmaterially changed\u201d \nimplicated factual issues not appropriate for resolution at the pleading stage) .  At this stage of the \ncase, and on this limited factual record , I cannot conclude as a matter of law that Viking\u2019s claims \nare patently unmeritorious .  See also Mary Ann Pensiero, 847 F.2d at 94 (\u201c[T]he Rule should not \nbe applied to adventuresome, though responsible, lawyering which advocates creative legal theories.\u201d); StrikeForce Techs., Inc. v. WhiteSky, Inc. , No. 13- 1895, 2013 WL 5574643, at *4 \n(D.N.J. Oct. 9, 2013) (\u201c [Rule 11]  is not an appropriate vehicle for resolving legal or factual \ndisputes.\u201d) .  FSCLE might have ultimately turned out to be right  on all of those points , but Viking\u2019s \npositions are not so absurd as to be objectively unreasonable , implausible,  or frivolous.   \nI conclude that Rule 11 sanctions are not warranted here . \n  11 \n B. The Court should not award fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. \nI next turn to FSCLE\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285.  According to \nFSCLE,  Viking\u2019s voluntary dismissal of its infringement counterclaims made FSCLE the \n\u201cprevailing party\u201d on those claims.  And FSCLE argues that the Court should award attorney\u2019s \nfees because Viking\u2019s \u201cunreasonable litigation conduct\u201d  makes this case exceptional . \nEven if FSCLE were a prevailing party  on Viking\u2019s counterclaims  (which is not at all clear \nto me ),6 Viking  did not litigate its counterclaims unreasonably.  FSCLE basically relies upon the \nsame arguments it made in its Rule 11 motion , namely, that Viking should have never filed \ncounterclaims in the first place because it had not made a reasonable prefiling inquiry and therefore \nhad instituted a frivolous suit , but I disagree for the  reasons already explained.   Moreover, Viking \ndropped its infringement counterclaims two weeks after FSCLE filed a sworn declaration that it no longer purchased refurbished display a ssemblies.    \n \n6 Viking voluntarily dismissed its counterclaims pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1) (A)(i).  Viking\u2019s \ndismissal did not require a court order, and a party\u2019s first voluntary dismissal is \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d \n(unless the notice of dismissal states otherwise).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i), (B).  Under such \ncircumst ances, there is no \u201ccourt decision establishing the judicial imprimatur required for a \nlitigant to emerge as the prevailing party under \u00a7 285.\u201d  O .F. Mossberg & Sons, Inc. v. Timney \nTriggers, LLC , 955 F.3d 990, 993 (Fed. Cir. 2020) .   \nFSCLE contends that V iking\u2019s dismissal of its counterclaims was actually its second \ndismissal of the same claims, because Viking previously dismissed infringement claims against FSC.  FSCLE cites cases where courts have held that a second voluntary dismissal \u2014which Rule \n41(a)(1 )(B) says \u201coperates as an adjudication on the merits\u201d \u2014is sufficient to convey prevailing \nparty status.  Realtime Adaptive Streaming LLC v. Netflix, Inc. , No. 19-6359, 2020 WL 7889048, \nat *5 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 23, 2020) .  FSCLE also points to cases in which courts held that the two -\ndismissal rule applies if the defendants are not the same, but are in privity with each other or share the same legal rights.  See , e.g., St. Clair Intell. Prop. Consultants, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 291 \nF.R.D. 75, 78 (D. Del. 2013)  (citing cases) .   \nFSCLE argues that the two -dismissal rule should apply here because it is \u201can entity \nsubstantially and practically the same\u201d as FSC .  (D.I. 39 at 7.)  That is a curious argument to say \nthe least, as the record reflects that FSCLE\u2019s c ounsel told Viking that FSC and FSCLE were \ndifferent entities (and that FSC did not repair smartphones) in order to convince Viking to drop \nFSC from the original infringement case , which V iking then did.   12 \n Nor was Viking\u2019s conduct  in the litigation as a whole unreasonable  when considered under \nthe totality of the circumstances.  FSCLE initiated this action.  And a side from FSCLE\u2019s many \nmotions ( to dismiss  Viking\u2019s counterclaims , for sanctions, for attorney\u2019s fees, and for \u201c entry of \njudgment of noninfringement \u201d), the case was barely litigated at all.  No scheduling order was \nentered, the parties never commenced discovery , and all claims are or will be dismissed .  \nIn sum, this  case is not exceptional , and FSCLE\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees should be \ndenied.  \nC. The Court should grant  FSCLE\u2019s request to voluntar ily dismiss  its declaratory \njudgment claims , but deny its request for \u201cjudgment of noninfring ement.\u201d  \n \nThe last pending motion is FSCLE\u2019s \u201cMotion for Voluntary Dismissal Under Rule 41(a)(2) \nand For Entry of Final Judgment Under Rules 54 and 58.\u201d  FSCLE seeks to voluntarily dismiss its \ndeclaratory judgment claims without prejudice , and Viking does not oppose that request.  \nAccordingly, I recommend that the Court dismiss FSCLE\u2019s claims without prejudice. \nFSCLE also  asks the Court to enter \u201c[j]udgment of non- infringement of all claims of U.S. \nPatent Nos. 8,888,953 and 10,220,537 in f avor of [FSCLE] .\u201d  (D.I. 52 (\u201c[Proposed] Order\u201d).)  That \nrequest is improper.  All of the claims in this action are or will be dismissed; there are no  claims \nleft on which the Court can enter judgment.  FSCLE cites no authority supporting the proposition \nthat the Court can enter separate \u201cjudgment\u201d on voluntarily dismissed claims.7 \n  \n \n7 I do not understand FSCLE\u2019s request  to dismiss its declaratory judgment claims to be \ncontingent upon the Court granting judgment in its favor.  If that understanding is incorrect, \nFSCLE may withdraw its motion and continue with its case. \n The Court\u2019s refus al to grant \u201cjudgment of noninfringement\u201d to FSCLE is not intended to \nforeclose FSCLE from arguing in a future case that Viking\u2019s notice of dismissal of its infringement \ncounterclaims against FSCLE \u201coperates as an adjudication on the merits.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ.  P. \n41(a)(1)(B).  I am skeptical of FSCLE\u2019s position that it does ( see n.6, supra ), but the Court does \nnot need to decide that issue to resolve the pending motions. 13 \n IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I recommend the following: \n1. FSCLE \u2019s Motion for Sanctions U nder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 285, and the Inherent Powers of the Court (D.I. 18) should be DENIED ;  \n2. FSCLE \u2019s Motion for Attorneys\u2019  Fees Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 \nand 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 (D.I. 38) should be DENIED ; and \n3. FSCLE \u2019s Motion for Voluntary Dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2) and for Entry of \nFinal Judgment under Rules 54 and 58 (D.I. 52) should be  GRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED -\nIN-PART .  FSCLE \u2019s request to dismiss its claims without prejudice should be  GRANTED.  \nFSCLE \u2019s request for entry of judgment should be DENIED.  \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.  Any \nobjections to the Report and Recommendation shall be filed within fourteen days and limi ted to \nten pages.   Any response shall be filed within fourteen days thereafter and limited to ten \npages.   The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de \nnovo review in the district court.    \nThe parties are directed to the Court\u2019s \u201cStanding Order for Objections Filed Under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72,\u201d dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which can be found on the Court\u2019s website.  \n Dated:  January 5, 2022    ___________________________________ \n       Jennifer L.
