Milewski, Roopa Sabesan, WHITE & WILLIAMS, Wilmington, \nDelaware \nCounsel for Defendant \nJanuary 19, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION CIDEF JUDGE \nPlaintiffs Terri Hansen, as a personal representative of the estate of Charles \nSecrest, and Beverly Shinn en, as a personal representative of the estate of Sophie \nStar Sakewicz, filed this lawsuit against Defendant Brandywine Nursing and \nRehabilitation Center, Inc. (Brandywine) on March 23, 2021 in the Superior Court \nof the State of Delaware. Secrest and Sakewicz were elderly residents at \nBrandywine when they contracted COVID-19 and died from resulting \ncomplications in 2020. Plaintiffs alleged in their Superior Court complaint state \nlaw claims for wrongful death, survival rights, gross negligence, willful and \nwanton negligence, and respondeat superior liability. D.I. 1, Ex. A. \nBrandywine removed the case to this Court on May 5, 202 l, asserting that \nPlaintiffs' claims are preempted by the federal Public Readiness and Emergency \nPreparedness Act (PREP Act)1 and that the state law claims arise under federal \nlaw. D.I. 1 at 4, 12. \n1 Congress passed the PREP Act to protect certain individuals from lawsuits arising \nfrom a public health emergency. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 247d-6d, 247d-6e. The Secretary \nof the Department of Health and Human Services may invoke the PREP Act upon \na determination that a health threat constitutes a public health emergency. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 247d-6e. In March 2020, the Secretary declared COVID-19 a public \nhealth emergency under the Act. See Declaration Under the PREP Act for Medical \nCountermeasures Against COVID-19, 85 Fed. Reg. 15,198, 15,201 (Mar. 17, \n2020). Pending before me is Plaintiffs' motion for remand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1447(c) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. D.I. 14. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS \n\"If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction, [a case removed from state court] shall be remanded.\" \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The defendant has the burden to show the \"existence and \ncontinuance of federal [ subject matter] jurisdiction\" for removal. Steel Valley \nAuth. v. Union Switch & Signal Div., 809 F.2d 1006, 1010 (3d Cir. 1987). If the \ndefendant fails to meet this burden, \"[a]n order remanding the case may ,require \npayment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as \na result of the removal.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). \"It is settled that the removal \nstatutes [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441-1452] are to be strictly construed against removal and \nall doubts should be resolved in favor of remand.\" Steel Valley Auth., 809 F.2d at \nIO 10. When deciding whether to remand a case, the district court is to accept as \ntrue all factual allegations in the complaint at the time of removal. Id. \nII. ANALYSIS \nPlaintiffs say a remand is required because the Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction. D.I. 15 at 3. It is undisputed that diversity jurisdiction does not exist \nhere. Plaintiffs argue that, because their Superior Court complaint alleges only \nstate law claims, federal question jurisdiction also does not exist. D.I. 15 at 3. \n2 Brandywine counters that ( 1) the PREP Act completely preempts Plaintiffs' claims \nand (2) Plaintiffs' complaint implicates the PREP Act and thus presents a \nsubstantial federal question under the Grable doctrine. D.I. 19 at 1-2; see \ngenerally Grable & Sons Metal Prod., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308, \n314 (2005) (holding that the \"test for jurisdiction over federal issues embedded in \nstate-law claims between nondiverse parties\" is whether \"state-law claim[s] \nnecessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a \nfederal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved \nbalance of federal and state judicial responsibilities\"). \nThe Third Circuit rejected both arguments advanced by Brandywine in \nMaglioli v. Alliance HC Holdings LLC, 16 F.4th 393,402 (3d Cir. 2021). \nBrandywine argues that Maglioli was wrongly decided, see D.I. 22-A, but it is not \nthe district court's prerogative to ignore controlling precedent. Maglioli is binding \nprecedent that dictates the result here; and so, I will grant the present motion and \nremand the case to the Superior Court. \nA. Complete Preemption \nBrandywine argues that \"[t]he PREP Act satisfies both prongs of the \ncomplete preemption analysis because it preempts a wide array of state law claims \nand simultaneously provides an exclusive federal cause of action[.]\" D.I. 19 at 7. \n3 But the Third Circuit rejected this broad reading of the PREP Act in Maglioli. As \nthe Court explained: \nA statute is completely preemptive if it provides the exclusive cause of \naction for the claim asserted and also sets forth procedures and remedies \ngoverning that cause of action. As applied to this case, we ask whether the \nPREP Act provides the exclusive cause of action for negligence claims \nagainst the nursing homes. . . . Here, the PREP Act creates an exclusive \ncause of action for willful misconduct. But the estates allege only \nnegligence, not willful misconduct. The estates' negligence claims thus do \nnot fall within scope of the exclusive federal cause of action. They are not \ncompletely preempted, so they belong in state court. \nMaglioli, 16 F .4th at 407-08 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations \nomitted). \nThe Court next considered in Maglioli \"whether the [plaintiff] estates could \nhave brought their claims under the PREP Act's cause of action for willful \nmisconduct.\" Id. at 410. The Court held they could not have because the estates \ndid not allege that \"the nursing homes acted with intent 'to achieve a wrongful \npurpose[]' or with knowledge that their actions lacked 'legal or factual \njustification.\"' Id. at 411 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d-6d(c){l)(A)). As the Court \nexplained: \nWillful misconduct is a separate cause of action from negligence. The \nelements of the state cause of action need not precisely duplicate the \nelements of the federal cause of action for complete preemption to apply. \nBut complete preemption does not apply when federal law creates an \nentirely different cause of action from the state claims in the complaint. \nCongress could have created a cause of action for negligence or general tort \nliability. It did not. Just as intentional torts, strict liability, and negligence \n4 are independent causes of action, so too willful misconduct under the PREP \nAct is an independent cause of action. \nId. at 411. \nLike the estates in Maglioli, Plaintiffs here allege various state law claims; \nand like the estates in Maglioli Plaintiffs do not allege that any act or omission was \ntaken \"intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose\" and \"knowingly without legal \nor factual justification[.]\" See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d-6d(c)(l)(A). Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs have not alleged a claim for willful misconduct under the PREP Act. It \nis true that Count IV of Plaintiffs' Complaint is titled \"Willful and Wanton \nMisconduct,\" but, without specific allegations of wrongful purpose, that bare \ncharacterization does not state a claim for willful misconduct within the bounds of \nthe Act. See Maglioli, 16 F .4th at 411 (\"Employing standard language for a \npunitive-damages request, the estates allege the nursing homes engaged in \n'conduct that was grossly reckless, willful, and wanton.' But we cannot infer from \nthat fleeting statement that the estates allege the nursing homes acted with intent \n'to achieve a wrongful purpose,' or with knowledge that their actions lacked 'legal \nor factual justification.\"' ( citations omitted)). \nB. Substantial Federal Question \nThe Court in Maglioli also rejected the argument that removal is proper \nbecause the claims present a substantial federal question under the Grable \nframework. D.I. 19 at 13-14. In the Court's words: \n5 Federal preemption is ordinarily a federal defense to the plaintiffs suit. As \na defense, it does not appear on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, and, \ntherefore, does not authorize removal to federal court. Here, the nursing \nhomes would at best be entitled to a preemption defense under the PREP \nAct. The estates would properly plead their state-law negligence claims \nwithout mentioning the PREP Act, so the PREP Act is not an essential \nelement of the plaintiffs' state law claim. We therefore lack federal-question \njurisdiction under Grable. \nMaglioli, 16 F.4th at 413 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations \nomitted). \nIII. CONCLUSION \nAs the Third Circuit explained in Maglioli, \"[f]ederal courts have limited \njurisdiction. Here, the estates of the deceased filed wrongful-death lawsuits against \nthe nursing homes. They filed in state court and asserted only garden-variety state\u00ad\nlaw claims, so state court is where these cases belong.\" Id. at 413. Accordingly, I \nwill remand this case. \n6 "}
