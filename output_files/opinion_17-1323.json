Legal rules can change while the parties \nare battling it out. Earlier this year, the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts \nsuccessfully argued that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s suit against \nthem was untimely. This C ourt dismissed the case without prejudice , relying on then -\nprevailing precedent . But then the Supreme Court announced a new rule. And the \nCFPB renewed its suit. Applying the new  rule, at least on the complaint  before me, \nthis case is timely .  \nPlus, the Trusts  say the CFPB lacks authority to sue them because they are not \n\u201ccovered persons\u201d under the Consumer Financial Protection Act . But they \u201cengaged \nin\u201d servicing loans and collecting debt through their contractors, so they fall within the st atute. I must thus let the CFPB\u2019s case proceed.  \nI. B\nACKGROUND  \nIn 2017, the CFPB sued the Trusts for engaging in forbidden  debt-collection and \nlitigation practices. First Am. Compl., D.I. 362 \u00b6\u00b6  1\u20132. Now the Trusts move to dis-\nmiss. U nderstanding that motion requires us to take a whistle -stop tour th rough both \nthis protracted enforcement action and the structure  of the CFPB .   \nA. The Trusts and the CFPB\u2019s e nforcement  \nThe Trusts were set  up to securitize student loans. They bought  a pool of 800,000 \nprivate loans, then sold notes secured by that pool to investors. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 34.  As stu-\ndents repaid their loans, the investors would take a cut. D.I. 54, at 4. Just like  any \nother securitization, the value of the notes depended on the riskiness of the 3 underlying asset: the more students default on their loan payments, the less valuable \nthe notes .  \nThus, the  Trusts have a powerful incentive to ensure that students do not miss \nloan payments. Since the Trusts have no employees, they collect debt and service the \nloans through third parties. First Am. Compl.  \u00b6 29.  \nTo that end, in 2009 the Trusts contracted with a s pecial servicer to collect \u201cpast-\ndue and defaulted student loans\u201d and to do \u201ccollections litigation.\u201d D.I. 54, at 5. The \nspecial servicer, in turn, entered into agreements with \u201c subservicers, \u201d who would \n\u201cconduct[ ] collections\u201d and \u201coversee[ ] various law firms that [would] file collec tion \nlawsuits against borrowers in the name of the Trusts.\u201d Id. ; see First Am. Compl.  \n\u00b6\u00b6 38\u201344.  \nBut the subservicers soon attracted the attention of the CFPB. After a lengthy \ninvestigation, it found that the subservicers had \u201cexecuted and notarized deceptive \naffidavits\u201d and \u201cfiled \u2026 collections lawsuits lacking\u201d  key evidence.  First Am. Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 49\u201350. The CFPB concluded that they engaged in unfair and deceptive debt -col-\nlection practices. D.I. 54, at 1 \u20132.  \nSo in 2014, the CFPB started administrative procee dings against the Trusts . \nThough the parties reached a settlement and asked the Court to enter a consent de-\ncree, the Court declined. D.I. 272. That forced the CFPB to sue .  \nB. The structure of the CFPB and the Trusts \u2019 first motion to d ismiss  \nBut midway through this litigation, the  Supreme Court injected  a new issue. Since \nits creation in 2008, the CFPB had been headed by a single d irector, insulated from \nremoval by the President. Yet the Court said that structure \u201cviolate[d] the separation 4 of powers .\u201d Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin.  Prot.  Bureau , 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2197, 2209 \n(2020). So it severed the removal restriction, leaving the rest of the statute intact.   \nThat ruling implicated this enforcement action , which t he CFPB filed in 2017 \nwhile hea ded by an improperly  insulated director. Aware that such a d irector may  \nhave  lacked the power to bring an enforcement action, a new d irector (now removable \nat will by the President) ratified the suit to cure any defect. D.I. 308 -1.  \nBut earlier this year, Judge Noreika ruled that the ratification came too late to \nsave this suit. D.I. 3 59, at 8\u2013 14. All CFPB enforcement actions must be brought \nwithin three years of the date on which it discovers the violation. 12 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 5564(g)(1). Yet here, the CFPB admitted that \u201cratification \u2026 came more than three \nyears after the date of discovery.\u201d D.I. 356, at 40: 20\u221221. Plus, it could not show that \nthe statute -of-limitations clock was extended by equitable tolling. So Judge Noreika \ndismissed the suit without prejudice, giving the CFPB another chance to explain why \nits suit was timely. D.I. 3 60. \nAfter that ruling, the CFPB amended its complaint. And the Trusts brought this \nmotion to dismiss, arguing that the new complaint suffered from  the same timeliness \ndefect as the first one. D.I. 367, at 7\u2013 11. They also contend that the Trusts do not \ncount as \u201ccovered person[s]\u201d under the Act and so cannot be targets of CFPB enforce-\nment. Id. at 11; 12 U.S.C. \u00a7  5481(6).  \nTo survive a motion to dismis s, a complaint must contain enough facts to \u201cstate a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  I must accept all 5 allegations in the complaint as true and draw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving \nparty. Foglia v. Renal Ventures Mgmt., LLC , 754 F.3d 153, 154 n.1 (3d Cir. 2014).   \nII. THIS SUIT IS NOT YET TIME BARRED  \nThe Trusts say the CFPB failed to ratify this suit before the statute- of-limitat ions \nclock ran out. But this  assumes  that unconstitutional removal protections automati-\ncally void agency action. And e arlier this year, the Supreme Court rejected that prem-\nise. Thus,  the CFPB stopped the clock  when it sued . So on the compliant  now before \nme, the suit is timely filed.  \nA. There was no need for the CFPB to ratify this suit  \nThe CFPB brought this suit while it was unconstitutionally structured. Back then, \ncourts saw actions brought by improperly structured agencies as \u201cultra vires\u201d a nd so \nvoid. Collins v. Yellen , 141 S. Ct. 1761, 1795 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part). \nAnd void actions cannot stop the statute -of-limitations clock. Thus, to save the suit, \nan agency had to cure the constitutional defect, then ratify the action be fore the clock \nran out. Here, ratification happened too late. So Judge Noreika dismissed this law-\nsuit. \nYet earlier this year , the Supreme Court undercut that reasoning . Id. at 1788 \n(majority opinion) . It held that an unconstitutional removal  restriction does not in-\nvalidate agency action  so long as the agency head was  properly appointed . Such an \nagency head has \u201cauthority to carry out the functions of the office .\u201d Id. So the agency\u2019s  \nactions are not \u201cvoid\u201d and do not need to be \u201cratified,\u201d unl ess a plaintiff can show that \nthe removal provision  harmed him . Id. Put differently, he must  show that the agency 6 action  would not have been taken but for the President\u2019s inability to remove the \nagency head. Id.  \nThat is not the case here. This suit would h ave been filed even if the d irector had \nbeen under presidential control. It has been litigated  by five directors of the CFPB, \nfour of whom were removable at will by the President. D.I. 377, at 2. And the CFPB \ndid not change its litigation strategy once the removal protection was eliminated . \nThis is strong evidence that this suit would have been brought  regardless . Thus, the \nCFPB\u2019s initial decision to bring this suit was not ultra vires . \nB. At this stage, I may not decide whether this suit is time barred  \nBecause the decision to bring this suit was a valid agency action, it  is not untimely \nif it was filed within three years of the date on which the CFPB discovered the alleged \nviolation. 12 U. S.C. \u00a7  5564(g)(1).  \nThe Trusts argue that even under this test , the suit is time barred. The CFPB \nsued  on September 18, 2017. Yet the Trusts say, the CFPB had discovered the alleged \nmisconduct by September 4, 2014, when it issued a civil investigative dema nd asking \nthe Trusts for information about possible violations. D.I. 367, at 19. If true, this suit \nis time barred.  \nBut the Trusts\u2019 argument is premature. On this motion to dismiss, I may consider \na statute -of-limitations defense only if \u201cthe face of the c omplaint demonstrates that \nthe plaintiff\u2019s claims are untimely.\u201d Stephens v. Clash , 796 F.3d 281, 288 (3d Cir. \n2015)  (internal quotation marks omitted) . Otherwise,  the defendant would be forced \nto state facts necessary to anticipate and overcome an affirma tive defense. Id.  7 Yet the Trusts  fall afoul of this rule by relying on a civil- investigative- demand \nletter outside the complaint. See D.I. 302- 3. Because I may not consider that letter, \nthe Trusts\u2019 argument fails. E ven if I could look at the letter, it does not unambigu-\nously show that the CFPB knew about the alleged violations by September 4, 2014. \nThe letter states that its purpose is to \u201cdetermine  whether [the Trusts] \u2026 engaged \n[in] \u2026 unlawful acts.\u201d Id. at 4. Such an investigation would have been pointless if the \nagency already knew about the Trusts \u2019 alleged misconduct.  \nThe Trusts may still try to make out  a statute -of-limitations defense, but th at will \nhave to wait until summary judgment.  \nIII. THE TRUSTS ARE \u201cCOVERED PERSONS \u201d UNDER THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL \nPROTECTION ACT \nThe Trusts argue that  the CFPB cannot bring an enforcement action against them  \nbecause  they are not \u201ccovered persons\u201d as required under the Act. But this theory is \nundercut by the statute\u2019s text: the Trusts \u201cengage in \u201d servicing and collecting debt.  \nStart with the text. The CFPB  may bring enforcement actions to \u201cprevent a cov-\nered person or service provider from committing or engaging i n an unfair, deceptive, \nor abusive act or practice.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7  5531(a) . Thus, it may sue only a \u201ccovered per-\nson\u201d or a \u201cservice provider.\u201d  The CFPB does not argue that  the Trusts are \u201cservice \nprovider[s] .\u201d See First Am. Compl.  \u00b6 8. So this suit may only proceed if they are \u201ccov-\nered person[s]\u201d: \u201cperson[s] that engage [] in offering or providing a consumer financial \nproduct or service.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5481(6).  \nThe CFPB argues that the Trusts qualify  because they \u201cengage [] in\u201d providing \nsome of the \u201cfinancial product[s] or service[s]\u201d listed in the Act: \u201cservicing loans, 8 including acquiring , purchasing , selling, brokering, or other extensions of credit\u201d and \n\u201ccollecting debt.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5481(6), (15)(A)(i), (x); First Am. Compl.  \u00b6 8. More precise ly, it \nclaims that the Trusts \u201cengage in regular servicing of  \u2026 loans\u201d and \u201cdebt -collection \nactivities  through \u2026 [its] subservicers.\u201d Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 35\u221236.  \nThe Trusts do not deny that their subservicers  collected debt or serviced loans . \nInstead,  they contend that the CFPB cannot hold them  liable for those actions. D.I. \n367, at 13. T he Trusts characterize themselves as \u201cpassive securitization vehicles \u2026 \n[that] take no action related to the servicing of student loans or collecting debt.\u201d Id. \nat 12.  \nSo this dispute boils down to the breadth of the word \u201cengage.\u201d Does a person \n\u201cengage\u201d in an activity if he contracts with a third party to do that activity on his \nbehalf? Yes.  \n\u201cEngage\u201d means to \u201cto embark in any business\u201d or to \u201center upon or employ oneself \nin an action.\u201d Engage  (def. 16), Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 2000); see also En-\ngage , Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (\u201cTo employ or involve oneself; to take \npart in; to embark on.\u201d).  \nThat defini tion is broad enough to encompass actions taken on a person\u2019s behalf \nby another, at least where that action is central to his enterprise. Thus, if a dairy \nfarmer contracts with a farmhand to milk his cows and never does that job himself, \nhe is still employ ed in or in the business of milking cows.  \nSo too here. The Trusts \u201cembark[ed] in [the] business\u201d of collecting debt and ser-\nvicing loans when they contracted with the servicers and subservicers to collect their 9 debt and service their loans. Indeed, t he CFPB alleges that the unfair and deceptive \ndebt-collection practices  happened  in lawsuits brought on behalf of the Trusts , with \nthe \u201crelevant Trust \u2026 named [as the] plaintiff in the action.\u201d First Am. Compl.  \u00b6 37. \nThose suits could have proceeded only with the Trust s\u2019 involvement: with narrow ex-\nceptions, \u201ca party \u2026 must assert his own legal rights and interests.\u201d Kowalski v. Tes-\nmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004)  (internal quotation marks omitted) . The subservicers \ncould not have collected any debt without the Trust s\u2019 say-so. \nTrue, the subservicers were independent contractors and not Trust employees. \nD.I. 302 -1 \u00a7 17. But that is not dispositive. Debt collection and loan servicing are core \naspects of the Trusts\u2019 business model. If they did not enforce debtors\u2019 obligations, \ntheir pool of loans would be less valuable , as would the notes they sell to investors. \nThe Trusts cannot claim that they were not \u201cengaged in\u201d a key part of their business \njust because they contracted it out. Cf. Barbato v. Greystone All., LLC , 916 F.3d 260, \n266\u221268 (3d Cir. 2019) (finding that a \u201c passive debt owner\u201d counted as a \u201cdebt collec-\ntor\u201d under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act when it contracted with a third \nparty to collect debt on its behalf).  \nPlus, if Congress wanted to allow enforcement against only those who directly en-\ngage in of fering or providing consumer financial services , it could have said so. See, \ne.g., 12 U.S.C. \u00a7  5481(15)(A)(vii)(I) (exempting some merchants from \u201ccovered person\u201d \nstatus where they deal in \u201cnonfinancial good[s] or service[s] sold directly \u2026 to the \nconsumer \u201d).  10 Pushing  back, the Trusts note  that the Act expressly enumerates when a \u201crelated \nperson\u201d may be sued based on his relationship to a covered person.  D.I. 367, at 14  \n(citing 12 U.S.C. \u00a7  5481(25)) . That provision, they reason, displaces common -law vi-\ncario us liability. Maybe so. But because the Trusts themselves count as covered per-\nsons, I need not decide whether a non- covered -person principal can ever be held vi-\ncariously liable for the acts of his covered -person agent.  \n* * * * * \nThe Trusts argue that the CFPB was powerless to file this suit and that it filed \ntoo late. But both arguments fail. On the complaint  now before me, this suit was \ntimely filed. And the CFPB may sue the Trusts because they are \u201ccovered persons \u201d \nunder the Consumer Financial Protection Act. Thus, this enforcement action  may \nproceed .   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nCONSUMER  FINANCIAL  \nPROTECTION  BUREAU , \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nNATIONAL  COLLEGIATE  MASTER  \nSTUDENT  LOAN  TRUST  et al.  \n \nDefendant s. \n No. 1:17- cv-1323-SB \n \nORDER  \n1.
