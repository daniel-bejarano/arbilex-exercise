WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nPlaintiff Automated Precision , Inc. (\"API\") filed this action against Defendants Timothy \nPare and Sandra Pare. D.I. 1 at 1. API alleges that Defendants breached their stock purchase \nagreement with API; that Timothy Pare breached his non-competition agreement with API; and \nthat Defendants tortiously interfered with API's business relationships. D.I. 1 ,r,r 34-35, 41-43, \n47-54. Pending before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction, improper venue,forum non conveniens , and failure to state a claim under Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), 12(b)(3), and 12(b)(6). D.I.11. The matter is fully briefed, \nand no hearing is required. For the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant Defendants ' \nmotion as to Counts II and III, but deny the motion as to Count I. \nI. BACKGROUND1 \nA. Relationship Between the Parties \nTimothy Pare and Sandra Pare are residents of Ontario, Canada, and the former owners of \nExact Laser Measurements USA, Inc. (\"Exact USA\") and Exact Laser Measurements, Inc. \n(\"Exact Canada\"). D.I. 1 ,r,r 3-6, 14-15; D.I. 16 at 2, 5. API, a Maryland corporation, has a \nwholly owned Canadian subsidiary, 2694547 Ontario, Inc. (\"269\"). D.I. 1 ,r,r 3, 16. On July 1, \n2019, Defendants entered separate stock purchase agreements to sell Exact USA to API (the \n\"USA SPA\") and Exact Canada to 269 (the \"Canada SPA\"). D.I. 1116, 15; D.I. 1-1 at 1. On \nthe same date, Timothy Pare and API entered a Non-Competition, Confidentiality, and \n1 Under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all factual allegations in the Complaint and \nview those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Fed. Trade Comm 'n v. Abb Vie \nInc, 976 F.3d 327, 351 (3d Cir. 2020). Inventions Agreement (the \"Non-Compete Agreement \") as part of API's employment of \nTimothy Pare. D.I.1117 ; D.I. 1-2 at 1, 8. \nTimothy Pare entered an employment agreement with API on June 25, 2019, pursuant to \nwhich Timothy Pare would work out of API's Michigan office (the \"Michigan Employment \nAgreement \"). D.I. 12-1, Ex. 2. The Michigan Employment Agreement was \"contingent upon \nsigning a Non-[C]ompete Agreement prior to employment[.]\" D.I. 12-1, Ex. 2 at 2. \nB. Key Provisions of the Agreements \nSection 8.9 of the USA SPA-a covenant not to compete-states , in relevant part, that \n... [Defendant]s agrees [sic] that for a period of five (5) years from \nand after the Closing Date (the \"Noncompetition Period''), \n[Defendants] will not, and will cause their Affiliates not to, directly \nor indirectly, for itself or any other Person, either as principal, agent, \nmanager, consultant , partner, owner, investor, employee , \ndistributor , dealer, representati ve,joint venturer, creditor, franchisee \nor otherwise : \n(i) engage in any business that competes with the \nBusiness [i.e., \"providing laser tracker measurement \nservices,\" D.I. 1-1 at 1] as conducted any time prior \nto the Closing ... ; \n(ii) induce or influence , or attempt to induce or \ninfluence , any employee or contractor of [ API] or \nany of its Affiliates . . . to terminate his or her \nemployment or engagement with [ API] or such \nAffiliate or in any way interfere with the relationship \nbetween [API] or its Affiliates ... and any of their \nemployees or contractors; or \n(iii) induce or influence , or attempt to induce or \ninfluence , any client, customer, supplier, licensee, \nconsultant or other business relation of [ API] or any \nof its Affiliates . . . to cease doing business with \n[ API] or such Affiliate, or in any way interfere with \nthe relationship between [ API] or such Affiliate ... \nand its clients, customers , suppliers, licensees, \nconsultants or other business relations, whether or \nnot such relation is evidenced by a Contract. \n2 D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 8.9. API's \"Affiliates\" under the USA SPA include Exact USA and Exact Canada. \nSee D.I. 1-1 at 2 (defining \"Affiliate\"). \nSection 12.10 of the USA SP A contains a provision entitled \"Consent to Jurisdiction and \nService of Process\": \n... [T]he parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the \ncourts of New Castle County, Delaware or the courts of the United \nStates located in New Castle County in the State of Delaware in \nrespect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of \nthis Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and hereby waive, \nand agree not to assert, any defense in any action, suit or proceeding \nfor the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement and any \nAncillary Agreement , that they are not subject thereto or that such \naction, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable \nin such courts ... , that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in \nan inconvenient forum or that the venue of the suit, action or \nproceeding is improper. ... \nD.I. 1-1 \u00a7 12.10. And the USA SPA defines \"Ancillary Agreements\" to include \neach other agreement , document , instrument or certificate \ncontemplated by this Agreement or to be executed by [ API] or \n[Defendants] in connection with the consummation of the \ntransactions contemplated by this Agreement , in each case, only as \napplicable to the relevant party or parties to such Ancillary \nAgreement, as indicated by the context in which such term is used. \nD.I. 1-1 at 2. The Canada SPA contains a mirror provision , but it provides for \"exclusive \njurisdiction of the courts of Ontario .... \" D.I. 12-1, Ex. 7 \u00a7 12.10. \nFinally, Paragraph 3 of the Non-Compete Agreement prohibits Timothy Pare-during the \nlife of the Agreement and for two years thereafter-from taking away or attempting to take away \n\"the business or patronage of [API]'s current, or prospective clients, customers or accounts\" and \nfrom soliciting, hiring, or recruiting \"any employee or independent contractor of [API] .... \" \nD.I. 1-2 ,r 3(b). The Non-Compete Agreement also contains a jurisdiction provision: \nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance \nwith the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to conflicts \n3 oflaws principles, and for any action arising out of or relating to this \nAgreement, exclusive jurisdiction shall exist in the state or federal \ncourts of Maryland or the state in which [Timothy Pare] resides. \nD.I. 1-2114. The Non-Compete Agreement does not appear to make any reference to the USA \nSPA, see D.I. 1-2, and, while the USA SPA contains a non-competition provision, it does not \nreference the Non-Compete Agreement , see D.I. 1-1. \nC. Defendants' Conduct \nSix paragraphs of API' s Complaint provide the factual allegations that support the breach \nof contract and tortious interference claims against Defendants: \n19. Timothy [Pare] and/or Sandra Pare were, or became owners or \npart owners of CMF Group, Inc. [(CMF)], a long-time customer of \n[Exact USA and Exact Canada]. Timothy Pare failed to disclose \nthat conflict of interest to API .... \n20 .... Defendants induced or influenced , or attempted to induce or \ninfluence, CMF to cease doing business with API and induced or \ninfluenced, or attempted to induce or influence, CMF to instead do \nbusiness with an entity ... owned and/or controlled by Defendants' \nson and former employee of API, Tyler Pare [known as E.L.M., Inc. \n(\"ELM\")]. [ELM] shares an address with CMF, and is now owned \nor partly owned by Defendants , in both Windsor, Ontario, and in \nMadison Heights, Michigan. \n21. Also, shortly after leaving the employ of API, Defendant \nTimothy Pare ... acted as a consultant and/or independent \ncontractor for Comau, Inc. [(\"Comau\")] and induced or influenced, \nor attempted to induce or influence , Comau from doing business \nwith API and induced or influenced , or attempted to induce or \ninfluence, Comau to instead do business with [ELM]. Timothy Pare \nwas witnessed instructing and directing Comau subcontractors at the \nGeneral Motors Oshawa, Ontario assembly plant. \n22. As a result, Defendants willfully and materially breached the \n[USA SP A] by inducing or influencing , or attempting to induce or \ninfluence, clients, customers , suppliers, licensees, consultants or \nother business relations of API and/or [Exact USA and/or Exact \nCanada] from doing business with API, and by interfering with the \nrelationship between, API and their clients, customers , suppliers, \n4 licensees, consultants or other business relations, in violation of \n\u00a7 8.9(a)(iii) of the [USA SPA]. \n25. Defendants also willfully and materially breached the [USA \nSP A] by inducing or influencing , or attempting to induce or \ninfluence , employees of API [to] terminate their employment with \nAPI and otherwise interfered with the relationship between Plaintiff \nAPI and their employees in violation of \u00a78.9(a)(ii) of the [USA \nSPA]. \n26. Specifically , Defendants willfully and materially breached the \n[USA SP A] by failing to effectively manage the employees of Exact \nUSA who were retained by API following the purchase of Exact \nUSA by API and by failing to encourage such employees to execute \nthe employment benefits package provided by API and/or non\u00ad\ncompete agreements creating mistrust between such employees and \n[API] causing a majority of those employees to resign their \nemployment with by [sic] APL \nD.I. 1 ,r,r 19-26. \nAPI argues that it does not allege any claims under the Michigan Employment \nAgreement or the Canada SPA in this lawsuit. D.I. 16 at 5. Rather, API only brings claims for \nbreach of the Non-Compete Agreement and of the USA SPA. API alleges in Count I that \n\"Defendants willfully and materially breached the terms of the [USA SP A]\" by violating Section \n8.9 thereof. D.I. 1 ,r,r 34-35. In Count II, API alleges that \"Timothy Pare willfully and \nmaterially breached the Non-Compete Agreement .... \" D.I. ,r,r 41-43. In Count III, API \nalleges that Defendants intentionally and tortiously interfered with \"existing and prospective \nbusiness relationships\" between API and its customers . D.I. ,r,r 49-50. For each count, API \nrequests both injunctive and monetary relief. \nD. Other Litigation Between the Parties \nBefore API filed the instant litigation, Defendants filed two lawsuits against APL \nDefendants state that the first suit, filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on February 26, \n5 2021, alleged that API, 269, Exact Canada, Exact USA, and several API corporate officers \nbreached the Canada SPA and the Michigan Employment Agreement on various grounds. D.I. \n12 at 4. Defendants state that the second suit, filed in Michigan state court on March 25, 2021, \nalleged that the same defendants breached the USA SP A, the Canada SP A, and the Michigan \nEmployment Agreement on similar grounds. D.I. 12 at 4-5. According to API, the Michigan \ncourt \"dismissed all claims against the corporate defendants due to the Ontario exclusive \njurisdiction clause in the [Canada] SPA.\" D.I. 16 at 5-6 (footnote omitted). API adds that both \nlawsuits raised certain related tort claims and that none of the allegations in either lawsuit \"relate \nto the contracts at issue in this lawsuit (i.e., the D USA SPA or [the] Non-Compete Agreement ).\" \nD.I. 16 at 6. However , API does not otherwise contest Defendants ' summary of the lawsuits. \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nDefendants move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction , improper venue,forum non \nconveniens , and failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted under Rules 12(b)(2), \n12(b)(3), and 12(b)(6). \nA. Lack of Personal Jurisdiction \nUnless a federal statute provides otherwise , a federal court has jurisdiction over a party \nonly if the defendant is subject to the jurisdiction of the state in which the district court sits. \nFischer v. Fed. Express Corp., 42 F.4th 366, 382 (3d Cir. 2022). Jurisdiction must comport with \nthe state's long-arm statute and with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution . Id. at 382-\n83. Therefore, if the district court lacks general jurisdiction over the defendants , \"personal \njurisdiction only reaches claims that arise out of or relate to the minimum contacts a plaintiff can \ndemonstrate between the defendant and the forum state.\" Id. at 383. For that reason, courts \n\"generally evaluate specific jurisdiction on a claim-by-claim basis.\" Marten v. Godwin, 499 \nF.3d 290,296 (3d Cir. 2007); see Scott v. Lackey, 587 F. App'x 712, 717 n.9 (3d Cir. 2014); 4A \n6 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Adam N. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure\u00a7 \n1069. 7 ( 4th ed., 2002) (\"[A] plaintiff also must secure personal jurisdiction over a defendant \nwith respect to each claim she asserts.\"). \n\"The right to move for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction ... is not unlimited .... \n[It] can be affirmatively and implicitly waived through conduct.\" In re Asbestos Prods. Liab. \nLitig. (No. VI), 921 F.3d 98, 104-105 (3d Cir. 2019) (citations omitted). \"For example, \nparticularly in the commercial context, parties frequently stipulate in advance to submit their \ncontroversies for resolution within a particular jurisdiction . Where such forum-selection \nprovisions have been obtained through 'freely negotiated ' agreements and are not 'unreasonable \nand unjust,' their enforcement does not offend due process.\" Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , \n471 U.S. 462,472 n.14 (1985) (citations omitted). \nB. Improper Venue \n\"Venue fundamentally refers to locality, the place where a lawsuit should be heard. \n[V]enue 'is primarily a matter of choosing a convenient forum,\"' so \"parties can agree to venue \namong themselves ,\" such as via a forum selection clause. Wall St. Aubrey Golf, LLC v. Aubrey, \n189 F. App'x 82, 87 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting Wachovia Bankv. Schmidt, 546 U.S. 303,305 \n(2006)) (cleaned up). The remedy for improper venue is dismissal or transfer \"to any district or \ndivision in which [the case] could have been brought.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a). \nC. Forum Non Conveniens \nFederal courts may dismiss a case under the doctrine of forum non conveniens \"even if \njurisdiction and proper venue are established \" based either on \"oppressiveness and vexation to a \ndefendant\" or on \"the court's own administrati ve and legal problems .... \" Am. Dredging Co. v. \nMiller, 510 U.S. 443, 447-48 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The \n7 doctrine generally applies only when the alternative forum that can hear a case is in a foreign \ncountry. Sinochem Int'l, Co. v. Malaysia Int'! Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422,430 (2007) \nA valid and applicable forum selection clause alters the typical/arum non conveniens \nanalysis: \"a plaintiff's choice of forum in filing his or her lawsuit 'merits no weight,' and [the \nCourt is] not to consider any arguments about the parties' private interests-those 'weigh \nentirely in favor of the preselected ... forum.\"' Collins On behalf of herself v. Mary Kay, Inc., \n874 F.3d 176, 186 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting At/. Marine Const. Co. v. US. Dist. Ct.for W Dist. of \nTexas, 571 U.S. 49, 63-64 (2013)). As a result, the district court should only consider whether \nan adequate alternative forum exists and the \"relevant public interest factors affecting the \nconvenience of the forum.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Those \nconsiderations \"will overcome a forum selection clause in only the most 'unusual' and \n'extraordinary ' circumstances.\" Id. ( quoting At!. Marine Const., 571 U.S. at 62, 64). \nD. Failure to State a Claim \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2). Such a claim must plausibly suggest \"facts sufficient to 'draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"' Doe v. Princeton Univ., 3 0 F .4th 3 3 5, \n342 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.\"' Klotz v. Celentano Stadtmauer & Walentowicz LLP, 991 F.3d 458, \n462 (3d Cir. 2021) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). However , the Court will '\"disregard legal \nconclusions and recitals of the elements of a cause of action supported by mere conclusory \nstatements.'\" Princeton Univ., 30 F .4th at 342 ( citation omitted). \n8 '\"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' Pinnavaia v. Celotex Asbestos Settlement Tr., \n271 F. Supp. 3d 705, 708 (D. Del. 2017) (quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 \nF.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997)), affd, 2018 WL 11446482 (3d Cir. Apr. 6, 2018). \"A motion to \ndismiss 'may be granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, \nand viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\"' \nMcCrone v. Acme Markets, 561 F. App'x 169, 172 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Burlington Coat \nFactory, 114 F.3d at 1420). \nID. DISCUSSION \nAs discussed in more detail below, the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendants \nas to API's claim for breach of the Non-Compete Agreement (Count II). API fails to plead a \ntortious interference claim (Count III) for which relief can be granted. However, API may \nproceed against Defendants in this forum on its claim for breach of the USA SP A (Count I). \nA. Count I: Breach of the USA SP A \nThe Court finds that it has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants and that venue is \nproper as to Count I. This case should not be dismissed in favor of an Ontario, Canada forum, \nand API states a claim on which relief can be granted. \ni. Personal Jurisdiction \nThe parties agree that this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants only \nif the USA SP A's forum selection clause established their consent to jurisdiction. D.I. 12 at 14-\n15; D.I. 16 at 6--9. However, Defendants argue that the Canada SPA's forum selection clause \napplies to claims for breach of the USA SPA, since the USA SPA's \"Background\" section refers \nto the Canada SPA. D.I. 12 at 11-14. API argues that the USA SPA's forum selection clause \n9 applies to claims for breach of the USA SPA and of the Non-Compete Agreement, since the \nNon-Compete Agreement is ancillary to the USA SPA. D.I. 16 at 7-8. \nFederal law governs the enforceability of a forum selection clause in federal court. \nCollins, 874 F.3d at 181 & n.3. The party that seeks the clause's enforcement must establish that \nthe claims and parties in the suit are \"subject to the forum-selection clause.\" See Brit. \nTelecommunications PLC v. Fortinet Inc., 424 F. Supp. 3d 362, 368 (D. Del. 2019) (citing \nAltvater Gessler-JA. Baczewski Int'! (USA), Inc. v. Sobieksi Destylarnia SA., 572 F.3d 86, 89 \n(2d Cir. 2009)). \"Federal law presumes forum selection clauses to be valid\" unless the forum is \n\"so gravely difficult and inconvenient that the resisting party will for all practical purposes be \ndeprived of his day in court, or the clause was procured through fraud or overreaching.\" \nMacDonald v. CashCall , Inc, 883 F.3d 220,232 n.14 (3d Cir. 2018) (cleaned up). The clause \nmust be \"freely negotiated\" and \"not unreasonable and unjust.\" Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. at 472 n.14 \n(1985) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Defendants argue that efficiency favors \ndismissal and that \"[m]aintaining this action will necessitate significant out-of-state travel for all \nparties and witnesses.\" D.I. 12 at 15-16. However Defendants provide no indication of fraud, \noverreaching , \"grave[]\" inconvenience , unreasonableness, or injustice. Thus, the USA SP A's \nforum selection clause is valid and enforceable. \nTherefore, if the USA SP A's forum selection clause applies to API' s breach of contract \nclaim, Defendants have waived an objection to personal jurisdiction in this Court. See D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 \n12.10. State law \"determine[ s] the scope of a forum selection clause-that is, whether the claims \nand parties involved in the suit are subject to the clause.\" In re McGraw-Hill Glob. Educ. \nHoldings LLC, 909 F.3d 48, 58 (3d Cir. 2018) (cleaned up). But see id. at 58-59 (applying \nfederal law due to party agreement). \n10 This Court, when sitting in diversity, applies Delaware choice-of-law rules to determine \nwhich state's law to apply, \"even where the contract contains a choice-of-law clause.\" Collins, \n874 F.3d at 183 (citation omitted). \"[Delaware] court[s] will interpret [a] forum selection clause \nin accordance with the law chosen to govern the contract.\" Germaninvestments AG v. Allomet \nCorp., 225 A.3d 316, 331 (Del. 2020) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the \nUSA SPA points to Delaware law. D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 12.8. Delaware courts seek to \"determin[e] the \nintent of the parties from the language of the contract\" and construe contracts as they \"would be \nunderstood by an objective, reasonable third party.\" Cox Commc 'ns, Inc. v. T-Mobile US, Inc., \n273 A.3d 752, 760 (Del. 2022) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).2 \n2 The parties' choice of law will control an agreement \"unless the chosen state lacks a substantial \nrelationship to the parties or transaction or [if] applying the law of the chosen state will offend a \nfundamental policy of a state with a material greater interest.\" SIGA Techs., Inc. v. \nPharmAthene, Inc., 67 A.3d 330, 342 (Del. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). However, where Delaware law would accord with that of the alternative jurisdiction , \n\"the Court should avoid the choice-of-law analysis altogether. \" Deuley v. DynCorp Int'!, Inc., 8 \nA.3d 1156, 1161 (Del. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Certain \nUnderwriters at Lloyds, London v. Chemtura Corp., 160 A.3d 457,464 n.45 (Del. 2017) (same). \nAbsent a choice-of-law provision, Delaware courts determine the governing law via the \"most \nsignificant relationship\" test. SIGA Techs., 67 A.3d at 341--42. Here, balancing that test's five \nfactors-\"(a) the place of contracting , (b) the place of negotiation of the contract, (c) the place of \nperformance, (d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and (e) the domicil, residence, \nnationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties[,]\" Chemtura , 160 A.3d at \n465-points to Michigan law. The record does not reveal where the USA SP A was negotiated or \nsigned. The purpose of the USA SP A was to acquire Exact USA, a Michigan corporation, and \nAPI has a Michigan office. See D.I. 1-1 at 1, \u00a7 5.l(a); D.I. 12 at 3. The Pares reside in Canada, \nand API's domicile is Maryland. D.I. 1 ,r,r 3-4. Thus, Michigan law is most likely to apply. \nLike Delaware courts, Michigan courts give \"unambiguous\" terms their \"plain meaning\" and \nseek to \"ascertain the intention of the parties.\" Shay v. Aldrich, 487 Mich. 648,660 (2010) \n( citations and internal quotations omitted). And, like Delaware, Michigan courts apply their \ngeneral rules for contract interpretation to the interpretation of forum selection clauses. Barshaw \nv. Allegheny Performance Plastics, LLC, 965 N.W.2d 729, 733-34 (Mich. App. 2020). \nDelaware and Michigan law have no conflict relevant to interpretation of the USA SPA's forum \nselection clause, so the Court will apply Delaware law in the absence of a conflict. \n11 The USA SPA's forum selection clause provides that \"the parties hereby submit to the \nexclusive jurisdiction of [Delaware state and federal courts] in respect of the interpretation and \nenforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements .... \" D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 \n12.10. Thus, that forum selection clause applies to a claim for breach of the USA SPA. \nHowever , Defendants argue that the Canada SPA's mirroring forum selection clause also \napplies to the USA SP A because the USA SP A \"was expressly intended to be executed in \nconnection with the transactions contemplated by the (Canada SPA].\" D.I. 12 at 12-13. An \n\"Ancillary Agreement(]\" is one executed \"in connection with the consummation of the \ntransactions contemplated by this Agreement .... \" D.I. 12-1, Ex. 7 \u00a7 1. The USA SPA recites \nthat Defendants and 269 will enter the Canada SPA \"(s]imultaneously\" with the USA SPA, D.I. \n1-1 at 1, and the Canada SPA contains a mirroring provision, D.I. 12-1, Ex. 7 at 1. However , the \nmirroring agreements and use of \"simultaneously \" suggests that the parties intended the separate \nagreements to work in parallel. Thus, the Canada SP A's provisions do not apply to the USA \nSP A. Defendants have waived objection to lack of personal jurisdiction in Delaware as to claims \nthat fall under the USA SP A's forum selection clause, such as a claim for breach of Section 8.9 \nof the USA SP A. Thus, the Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants as to Count I. \nii. Venue \nVenue in Delaware is proper for Count I. Defendants contend venue is improper , D.I. 12 \nat 16, but API disagrees and points to Defendants ' consent to venue in this Court in the USA \nSPA, D.I. 16 at 9. \"[P]arties can agree to venue among themselves .... \" Wall St. Aubrey Golf, \n189 F. App'x at 85, 87; see also Mack v. Rev Worldwide , Inc., 2020 WL 7774604, at *6 (Del. \nCh. Dec. 30, 2020) (holding that courts should honor a valid forum selection clause). The USA \nSPA's forum selection clause extends to Count I, see Section III.Ai., supra, and provides that \n\"the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New Castle County, \n12 Delaware or the courts of the United States located in New Castle County\" and that the parties \n\"hereby waive ... any defense ... that the venue of the suit ... is improper.\" D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 12.10. \nThe plain meaning of this clause is that Defendants and API consent to venue in this Court, a \nUnited States Court located in New Castle County, Delaware . Therefore, the Court will deny \nDefendants' motion to dismiss Count I for improper venue. \niii. Forum Non Conveniens \nDefendants next argue that, even if the Court has personal jurisdiction and even if venue \nis proper, the Court should dismiss this case because Delaware is an inconvenient forum. \nDefendants argue that the parties have agreed to Ontario, Canada as the proper alternative forum \nto adjudicate their disputes. D.I. 12 at 18. API argues that the USA SPA requires that it bring \nthis case in Delaware. D.I. 16 at 10. \nOn a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens where the parties' contract contains a \nvalid forum selection clause, the district court should only consider whether an adequate \nalternative forum exists and the \"relevant public interest factors affecting the convenience of the \nforum.\" Collins, 874 F.3d at 186 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Those \nconsiderations \"will overcome a forum selection clause in only the most 'unusual' and \n'extraordinary' circumstances .\" Id. (quoting At!. Marine Const., 571 U.S. at 62, 64). \nFirst, the forum selection clause applies to Count I. See Section III.A.i., supra. Next, \nDefendants identify Ontario--the forum that the Canada SP A selects-as an adequate alternative \nforum. D.I. 12 at 18. The Court will assume without deciding that Ontario is an adequate \nalternative forum. See D.I. 16 at 10 (arguing that API may not file its claims in Ontario). \nThird, the Court finds that the public interest factors do not support transfer. API asserts \nthat the public interest factors do not favor Defendants . D.I. 16 at 10. Defendants argue that this \ncase \"presents [an] exceptional circumstance \" and that \n13 [ n ]one of the witnesses, evidence, parties, or counsel are located in \nDelaware. None of the third parties could be compelled to attend \nvia subpoena. The parties have no relationship to Delaware , and \nDelaware has no interest in these proceedings. Trial counsel for the \nparties are located in Michigan and Ohio. Trial would be \nsignificantly more expensive in Delaware given the necessity of \ntravel for all witnesses and counsel, and the necessity of retaining \nDelaware counsel. \nD.I. 12 at 18. The Third Circuit noted that the relevant public interest factors \n\"may include [1] the administrative difficulties flowing from court \ncongestion; [2] the local interest in having localized controversies \ndecided at home; and [3] the interest in having the trial of a diversity \ncase in a forum that is at home with the law.\" \nCollins, 874 F.3d at 186-87 n.9 (cleaned up) (quoting At/. Marine Const., 571 U.S. at 62 n.6). In \nthe related context of a\u00a7 1404(a) transfer motion, see Atl. Marine Const., 571 U.S. at 60 (finding \n\u00a7 1404(a) codified/arum non conveniens in some cases), the Third Circuit also examines \"'the \nenforceability of the judgment\"' and '\"the public policies of the fora.\"' In re: Howmedica \nOsteonics Corp, 867 F.3d 390, 401-02 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 \nF.3d 873, 879-80 (3d Cir. 1995)). This open-ended list of public interest factors permits the \nCourt to consider other issues that the parties raise. Defendants raise burdening citizens in an \nunrelated forum with jury duty, D.I. 16 at 10 (quoting Collins, 874 F.3d at 186-87 n.9), and API \nraises the risk of conflicting interpretations of the same contract, D.I. 12 at 18. \nTo the extent that Defendants raise '\"practical problems that make trial of a case easy, \nexpeditious and inexpensive,\"' Howmedica Osteonics , 867 F.3d at 402 ( quoting At!. Marine, 571 \nU.S. at 62 n.6), such as travel for and the cost of trial, the Court will not consider them because \nDefendants \"waive[ d] the[ir] right to challenge the preselected forum as inconvenient[,]\" At!. \nMarine, 571 U.S. at 64. Delaware lacks a local interest in the outcome of this dispute; a \nproceeding here risks burdening a local jury; and consolidated litigation in Ontario may avoid \n14 conflicting rulings. However , the Court's familiarity with Delaware law-relative to a judge in \nOntario--weighs against dismissal for forum non conveniens. Neither API nor Defendants \ncontest the enforceability of the judgment in, raise policies of, or raise concerns about congestion \nin Delaware or Ontario. On balance, these public interest factors weigh against dismissal. \nMoreover, even combined with the assumed availability of an alternative forum, Defendants fail \nto show \"unusual and extraordinary circumstances \" that \"will overcome a forum selection clause \n.... \" Collins, 874 F.3d at 186 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the \nCourt will deny Defendants ' motion to dismiss Count I for forum non conveniens. \niv. Failure to State a Claim \nThe Court next turns to Defendants ' arguments on the merits. Defendants argue that \nmost of API' s allegations are mere conclusory statements and that its few factual allegations are \ninsufficient to state a claim for breach of contract (Count I). D.I. 12 at 9-11. API alleges that \nDefendants breached Section 8.9 of the USA SPA because Defendants (i) interfered with the \nbusiness relationships between API and CMF and between API and Comau and (ii) induced API \nemployees to terminate their employment relationship with APL D.I. 16 at 12. \nMany of the Complaint's allegations are mere \"recitals\" of the text of Section 8.9 of the \nUSA SPA, and the Court will '\"disregard \"' them. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th at 342 (citation \nomitted). However , some of API's factual allegations support the plausibility of its claims. \"A \nclaim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" ' Klotz, 991 \nF.3d at 462 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). Count I alleges breach of Section 8.9 of the USA \nSP A. That Section, in relevant part, prohibits Defendants from inducing or influencing \" any \n[API] employee or contractor\" \"to terminate his or her employment or engagement with [API]\" \nor from inducing or influencing an API customer \"to cease doing business with [API] .... \" D.I. \n15 1-1 \u00a7 8.9(a). The USA SPA generally extends these protections to API's subsidiaries, and those \nsubsidiaries include Exact USA and Exact Canada. D.I. 1-1 at 2; D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 8.9(a). \nThe Complaint alleges that Defendants became owners of longtime Exact client CMF, \nD.I. 1 ,r 19, and that Defendants induced or influenced CMF to do business with ELM-an entity \nthat Defendants' son, Tyler Pare, owns-instead of with Exact USA or Exact Canada, D.I. 1 ,r \n20. Those allegations support a plausible inference that Defendants induced an API customer to \ncease doing business with API's Exact subsidiaries , in violation of Section 8.9(a)(iii). The \nComplaint further alleges that Timothy Pare became a consultant for Comau and induced or \ninfluenced Comau to do business with ELM. D.L 1 ,r 21. The Complaint alleges no facts \nsuggesting that Comau had any relationship with Exact USA, Exact Canada, or APL D.L 1 ,r 21. \nSection 8.9(a)(iii) restricts Defendants ' conduct only with respect to \"any client, customer, \nsupplier, licensee, consultant or other business relation of [ API] or any of its Affiliates .... \" \nD.I. 1-1 \u00a7 8.9(a)(iii). Therefore , API's allegations related to Comau do not support a plausible \nallegation that API breached Section 8.9 of the USA SPA. \nFurther, the Complaint alleges that \"Defendants ... fail[ ed] to effectively manage the \nemployees of Exact USA who were retained by API ... and[] fail[ed] to encourage such \nemployees to execute the employment benefits package provided by API and/or non-compete \nagreements creating mistrust between such employees and [ API]\" and \"causing a majority of \nthose employees to resign their employment with[] APL\" D.I. 1 ,r 26. These allegations support \na plausible inference that Defendants influenced certain Exact employees to cease their \nemployment relationships with API in violation of Section 8.9(a)(ii). D.I. 1 ,r 26. Thus, two of \nAPI' s factual allegations are sufficient to plausibly support violations of Section 8.9 of the USA \nSP A. The Court will deny Defendants' motion to dismiss Count L \n16 B. Count II: Breach of the Non-Compete Agreement \nThe Court finds that it lacks personal jurisdiction over the Defendants as to Count II. \nAPI contends that the USA SPA's forum selection clause applies to claims for breach of the \nNon-Compete Agreement because the Non-Compete Agreement is ancillary to the USA SPA. \nD.I. 16 at 7-8. Defendants argue that the Non-Compete Agreement's forum selection clause--or \nthe Canada SPA 's forum selection clause-appl ies to claims for breach of the Non-Compete \nAgreement. D.I. 12 at 11-14. \nThe Court has already found that the USA SPA's forum selection clause is valid and \nenforceable , see Section III.A.i., supra, so the Court must again consider the clause's scope. The \nCourt, again, see Section III.A.i., supra, evaluates the scope of the USA SPA's forum selection \nclause under Delaware law, McGraw-Hill Glob. Educ. Holdings, 909 F.3d at 58; Fla. Chem. Co., \nLLC v. Flotek Indus., Inc., 262 A.3d 1066, 1080 (Del. Ch. 2021) (interpreting a forum selection \nclause under Delaware law in a contract governed by Delaware law). Delaware courts seek to \n\"determin[ e] the intent of the parties from the language of the contract\" and construe contracts as \nthey \"would be understood by an objective , reasonable third party.\" Cox Commc 'ns, 273 A.3d at \n760 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The USA SPA's forum selection clause \nextends to \"the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of ... the Ancillary Agreements \n.... \" D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 12.10. The Ancillary Agreements include \"each other agreement, document , \ninstrument or certificate contemplated by [ the USA SP A] or to be executed by [ API] or \n[Defendants] in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by [the \nUSA SPA] .... \" D.I. 1-1 at 2. Thus, Delaware state and federal courts have \"exclusive \njurisdiction \" over the interpretation or enforcement of an agreement \"contemplated by\" or \nexecuted \"in connection with\" the USA SP A. \n17 The parties agree that there is no basis for personal jurisdiction outside of the USA SP A's \nforum selection clause. D.I. 12 at 14-15; D.I. 16 at 6-9. That clause does not reach a claim for \nbreach of the Non-Compete Agreement. API's conclusory allegation that \"[t]he Non-Compete \nAgreement is an 'ancillary agreement \"' under the USA SPA, D.I. 1 ,r 18, is insufficient to sustain \npersonal jurisdiction. Rather, Defendant s must plead facts that plausibly show that the Non\u00ad\nCompete Agreement is \"contemplated by\" or executed \"in connection with\" the USA SP A. The \nparties fail to cite-and the Court cannot otherwise find-any mention of the Non-Compete \nAgreement in the USA SPA or any reference to the USA SPA in the Non-Compete Agreement. \nInstead, the Non-Compete Agreement has its own forum selection clause that looks to Maryland \ncourts. D.I. 1-2 at ,r 14. Thus, the Court will dismiss Count II for lack of personal jurisdiction . \nC. Count III: Tortious Interference with Contract and With Prospective Business \nRelations \nCount III raises two separate claims: tortious interference with contract and tortious \ninterference with prospective business relations. D.I. 16 at 14. The Court finds that API has \nfailed to state a claim for which the Court can grant relief as to both claims. Defendants argue \nthat the few factual allegations that API advances (beyond mere conclusory statements ) are \ninsufficient to state a claim for tortious interference. D.I. 12 at 10-11. API argues that its \nallegations as to CMF and Comau were sufficient to state a plausible claim for tortious \ninterference with contract and with prospecti ve business relations. D.I. 16 at 14-15. \nMany of the Complaint 's allegations are mere \"recitals\" of the elements of a claim for \ntortious interference with contract or with prospecti ve business relations, and the Court will \n\"'disregard\"' such allegations . Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th at 342 (citation omitted). The Court \nwill dismiss a claim unless it is plausible . Id. at 342. \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the \nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \n18 defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"' Klotz, 991 F.3d at 462 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. \nat 678). \nFirst, the Court will grant Defendants ' motion to dismiss API' s claim for tortious \ninterference with contract. The Court, as explained above, only has jurisdiction over Defendants \nif API's claims fall within the scope of the USA SPA's forum selection clause, see Section \nIII.A.i., supra, and the USA SPA selects Delaware law, D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 12.8. Under Delaware law, \nDefendants must have interfered with '\"a contract\"' to state a claim for tortious interference with \ncontract. O'Gara v. Coleman, 2020 WL 752070, at *9 (Del. Ch. Feb. 14, 2020) (quoting Bhole, \nInc. v. Shore Invs., Inc., 67 A.3d 444,453 (Del. 2013)) (some quotation marks omitted). API's \ntwo paragraphs of allegations about CMF, D.I. 1 ,r,r 19-20, and one paragraph of allegations \nabout Comau, D.I. 1 ,r 21, fail to allege that either CMF or Comau had a current contract with \nAPI with which Defendants interfered . See D.I. 1 ,r 19 (alleging Timothy Pare \"entered into a \ncontract on behalf of API with CMF\"). Thus, API fails to plausibly allege tortious interference \nwith contract under Delaware law. \nSecond, the Court will grant Defendants ' motion to dismiss API's claims for tortious \ninterference with prospective business relations. Defendants argue that API may not \"maintain a \ntortious interference claim based on an alleged breach of the [USA SPA] .... \" D.I. 17 at 3. To \nstate an actionable claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations, the \nplaintiff must allege \"wrongful\" conduct. See Agilent Techs., Inc. v. Kirkland, 2009 WL 119865, \nat * 8 (Del. Ch. Jan. 20, 2009). However , if the plaintiff alleges that the wrong committed was \nbreach of contract, courts must also consider the economic loss doctrine. \"[T]he economic loss \ndoctrine ... is a judicially created doctrine that allows a party to recover in tort only if losses are \naccompanied by bodily harm or property damages and not for losses that are solely economic in \n19 nature.\" JC Trading Ltd. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 947 F. Supp. 2d 449,459 (D. Del. 2013) \n( cleaned up). The economic loss doctrine will not bar a tortious interference claim '\" [i]f the \nclaimed duty is independent from the duties imposed by the contract .... \"' Aureus Holdings , \nLLC v. Kubient, Inc., 2021 WL 3465050, at *7 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 6, 2021) (quoting R. \nKeating & Sons, Inc. v. Chiselcreek Dev., LLC, 2020 WL 6390676, at *6 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. \n30, 2020)). In other words, a plaintiff cannot recover for tortious interference with prospective \nbusiness relations if the defendant's only alleged \"wrong\" was breach of the defendant 's contract \nwith the plaintiff. \nHere, API alleges only that its claims for tortious interference with prospective business \nrelations arise from \"the acts alleged herein.\" D.I. 1 ,r 49. The only applicable business \nrelationships API discusses in its Complaint are those with CMF and with Comau. D.I. 1 ,r,r 19-\n21; D.I. 16 at 14 (citing D.I. 1 ,r,r 20-21). API appears to allege that Defendants ' acts were \nwrongful because Defendants induced CMF and Comau to \"do business with\" ELM, which \nDefendants ' son controlled , instead of with APL D.I. 1 ,r,r 19-21. The Court sees no reason \nwhy, in the abstract, it is wrongful to encourage a company to do business with a person's family \nmember. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts\u00a7 767 & cmt./(1979) (determining \n\"improper\" conduct based on, e.g., the actor's economic interests, social interests, and the \nrelations between the parties); Agilent Techs., 2009 WL 119865, at *8 n.39 (citing Restatement \n(Second) of Torts\u00a7 767). Here, the action is wrongful only because Defendants had a duty \nunder the USA SPA not to steer business away from APL D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 8.9(a)(iii). Since API's \nbreach of contract claim arises from Defendants ' violation of this same duty, the Court finds that \nthe action for tortious interference is based on Defendants ' breach of the USA SP A. Therefore , \n20 the economic loss doctrine bars API' s tortious interference with prospective business relations \nclaim. The Court will dismiss Count III pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, Defendants ' motion to dismiss (D.I. 11) is granted in \npart and denied in part. API's claim for breach of the Non-Compete Agreement (Count II) is \ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction and API' s claims for tortious interference with \ncontract and with prospective business relations (Count III) are dismissed for failure to state a \nclaim. The Court dismisses Count III without prejudice since Defendants make no argument that \namendment of the Complaint would be \"inequitable or futile.\" Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, \n235 (3d Cir. 2004); see D.I. 17 at 5 (demanding that Count III be dismissed \"with prejudice\"). \nAPI's claim for breach of Section 8.9 of the USA SPA (Count I) may proceed on the grounds \nthat (1) Defendants induced or influenced CMF to cease doing business with API and to do \nbusiness, instead, with ELM and that (2) Defendants' failure to encourage certain API employees \nto sign benefits and non-competition agreements with API influenced those employees to \nterminate their employment with APL \nThe Court will issue an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n21 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAUTOMATED PRECISION , Inc. \nPlaintiff, \nV.
