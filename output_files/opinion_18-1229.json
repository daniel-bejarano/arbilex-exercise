Tort law is one \nthing ; securities regulation , another. Here, shareholders say a CEO misbehaved by  \npushing a deal that sold their company. Maybe so. But they sue under a law that  \npunishes  only material omissions or misleading statements. B ecause they cannot flag \nany such omission or statement, I dismiss their claims with prejudice.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nOn this motion to dismiss, I take the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true . Xura  \n(now Mavenir)  was a  publicly  traded telecommunications company . Second Am. \nCompl. , D.I. 87  \u00b6 23. In January 2015, it attracted a private equity fund , which  flirted \nwith the idea of buying the company. Id. \u00b6 29. Yet Xura rebuffed those  advances , in-\nsisting that it was worth more. Id. Instead of going private, Xura reinvented itself: it \nreorganized its staff , sold a weak part of its business, and bought another company . \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 30\u201335.  \nAfter watch ing Xura\u2019s makeover with interest, the Fund decided to have another \ngo at buying the company . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 35\u201337. So it  upped its offer by roughly  fifty percent. \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 42. This time, Xura\u2019s managers wanted to back the sale. But because Xura \nwas a public company, the shareholders needed to approve  it. To ensure  that the sale \nwent through, Xura\u2019s  managers asked the shareholders to let them vote on the 3 shareholders\u2019 behalf. In legalese, the mangers asked to be proxies for the sharehold-\ners. But before that could happen, the company had to issue a \u201cproxy statement\u201d in-\nforming the shareholders of the l ooming vote. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a- 9(a). \nFast-forward a few months, and the sale went through. Xura shareholders got \ntwenty percent above the market price  for their shares and the Fund got the company.  \nBut then the shareholders learned that the CEO might hav e misbehaved when nego-\ntiating the sale. Their suspicions were aroused because the CEO would benefit if the \nsale went through.  His contract was up for renewal , yet he was on thin ice with the \nBoard.  Second Amend. Compl.  \u00b6\u00b6 50\u201351. So if Xura  did not sell, he risked losing his \njob. Id. \u00b6 51. On the other hand, if  Xura did sell, he st ood to get millions  in severance \npay, bonuses, and other benefits . Id. \u00b6 24. \nThe shareholders worried that these incentives had driven  the CEO to force the \nsale through, no matter how bad it was . And they thought he had  undermined Xura\u2019s \nposition  by: \n\u2022 negotiating  directly with the Fund, id.  \u00b6\u00b6  65\u201369;  \n\u2022 sidelining  Xura\u2019s financial advisor and \u201cStrategic Committee\u201d from those \ntalks, id. \u00b6\u00b6 58, 103\u2013 05; and  \n\u2022 failin g to pursue other buyers  seriously, id. \u00b6\u00b6 117\u2013 18. \nSo the shareholders  sued Xura and some of its managers . They charge d that the \nearlier proxy statements were false, misleading, or omitted key facts.  See generally \nid. \u00b6\u00b6 98\u2013124. Had the statements been otherwise,  they stressed, they would have 4 demanded more money for their shares. This Court dismissed their claims a year ago. \nD.I. 79, 86.  \nThe shareholders now  return with their third  complaint. Once more, they face a \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Because they \nhave not cured their earlier mistakes , I dismiss their claims. And because this is their \nthird strike, I do so with prejudice. Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 235\u2013 36 (3d Cir. \n2004) (allowing dismissal with prejudice when amendment would be futile or inequi-\ntable).  \nII. THE SECURITIES CLAIMS FAIL \nTo survive this motion, the shareholders must  identify either : \n\u2022 a false or misleading claim  in the proxy statement  about a material  fact; or  \n\u2022 a material  omission that makes the proxy statement false or misleading.  \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7  78n(a)(1); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7  240.14a- 9(a). Thus, while the law bans some omis-\nsions, it does  not call for \u201c total disclosure.\u201d Jaroslawicz v. M&T Bank Corp. , 962 F.3d \n701, 705 (3d Cir. 2020). Otherwise , proxy statements  would be tomes.  \nThe shareholders  tear the proxy statement apart , claiming it s statements are  false \nor misleading . Yet none  is. So the shareholders  cannot state a claim.  \nFirst, the shareholders  complain that the proxy statement said  Xura had formed  \na strategic committee to review the deal. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6  116. Yet Xura did cre-\nate such a committee. Id. \u00b6 47. So the statement was true.  \nThe shareholders respond that the statement  was misleading because it gave the \nfalse impression that the committee played a meaningful role in the deal. Id. \u00b6 105. 5 True,  the committee did not take the lead  in the talks . But the statement never hinted \nthat it had . On the contrary, the proxy statement stressed that the Board  \u201cauthorized \nthe manage[rs] ,\u201d not the committee , \u201cto continue discussions with\u201d the Fund . D.I. 92  \n(emphasis added) , Ex. A  at 29; see also Guidotti v. Legal Helpers Debt Resol., 716 F.3d \n764, 772 (3d Cir. 2013) (letting me consider \u201c undisputedly authentic documents \u201d in-\ntegral to the complaint).  Indeed, the proxy statement referred to the committee only \nthree times. D.I. 92, Ex. A . Nobody who read it could reasonably conclude that the \ncommittee played a major role in the deal. So the statement introducing the commit-\ntee is not misleading.  \nNext, t he shareholders wrangle over a related list of  members of the strategic \ncommittee . Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106\u2013 07. Elsewhere, the proxy  statement touted the \nindependence of some of these members. Id. So the shareholders say that statement \nlulled them into believing in the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the \u201cnegotiations.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 107. But the \nproxy statement disclosed that the  committee included the  CEO.  Id. \u00b6 106. And it \nreminded readers that he might be conflicted. D.I. 92, Ex. A, at 39 . So this statement \nwas not misleading  either . \nThe same is true of t he shareholders \u2019 next claim . They highlight language inform-\ning them that Xura hired a financial advisor, Goldman Sachs . Second Am. Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 108\u2013 109. That language , say the shareholders, never mentioned that the CEO had \nsidelined Goldman in the negotiations. Id. Indeed, t hey say, Xura and the Fund \nagreed that all communication would flow through Xura\u2019s CEO, bypassing  Goldman . \nId. \u00b6 55. Maybe so. But  the proxy statement did not oversell the role that Goldman 6 played. Indeed , it clarified  that Goldman was not included in every communication. \nD.I. 92, Ex. A, at 32 . Plus, the shareholders concede that Goldman interacted with \nthe Fund many times . Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  72, 113. So the explanation  that Xura \nhad hired Goldman was not misleading.   \nThe shareholders next target the CEO  himself . They argu e that the proxy state-\nment never said that he  would win millions if Xura  sold to the Fund. Id. \u00b6 122. Yet \nthis ignores the proxy, which warned that \u201cexecutive officers \u2026 may have interests \nin the merg er.\u201d D.I. 92, Ex. A at 4, 39. And it  explained those \u201cinterests\u201d  in detail.  Id. \nat 49\u201351, 120\u2013 21.  \nAlternatively, the shareholders  fault the proxy for saying that the Fund had not \nagreed to retain Xura\u2019s leadership . Second Am. Compl. \u00b6  121. That was  misleading , \nthey claim,  because  the Fund always intended to keep the CEO. Id. But intent is one \nthing ; agreement , another. Plus, the Fund did not retain Xura\u2019s old CEO. Id. \u00b6 14. So \nthe proxy  statement was neither false nor misleading.  \nNext, the shareholders complain that the proxy  statement omitted key details \nabout other shoppers  interested in buying Xura. Id. \u00b6 117. They say the CEO made it \nimpossible for one shopper to bid on the company. Not so. The shopper dropped out \nonly because it could not match the Fund\u2019s better offer. Id. \u00b6 117. Assuming otherwise \ndoes not help the shareholders. Even if t he CEO had rigged the  competition, they fail  \nto tie that omission to a statement in the proxy. So this attack fails.   \nFinally, the  shareholders point to the proxy statement\u2019s  repor t that Xura had con-\ntacted twenty -six potential buyers.  Second Am. Compl.  \u00b6 118. Not one, said  the proxy  7 statement, made an offer.  Id. That was misleading, the shareholders say , because one \nshopper did show interest . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 118\u2013 19. But mere interest is not an offer . Plus, the \nproxy\u2019s statement about the twenty -six buyers limited itself to a  late stage of the sale . \nId. \u00b6 118. Yet the undisclosed  shopper  had shown interest at an earlier stage  of the \ndeal. Since the statement properly qualified itself, it could not be misleading.   \n* * * * * \nShareholders say that Xura\u2019s CEO misbehaved. Taking the complaint as true, he \nvery well might have. But the shareholders do not sue him for breaching his fiduciary \nduty. Rather, they sue over a proxy statement that is neither false nor misleading. \nSo their claims fail. And because they do, so do the claims against the CEO  and the \nother managers . \nThe shareholders have now filed three complaints , all based on  the same docu-\nment.  But that document, this Court has twice ruled, does not support their claims. \nIt would be futile  and inequitable  to let them amend their complaint yet again. So I \nwill dismiss these claims with prejudice.
