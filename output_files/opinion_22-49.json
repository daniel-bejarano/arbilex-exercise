Andrews", "date": "03-22-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nMETROM RAIL, LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. Civil Action No. 22-49-RGA \nSIEMENS MOBILITY , INC., et al., \nDefendants . \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff asserts five patents in five counts against two groups of Defendants. (D.I. 32). \nPlaintiff also asserts a count of tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and a \ncount of \"civil conspiracy \" against all Defendants. \nEach Defendant group has filed a motion to dismiss all counts. (D.I. 37, 39). Those two \nmotions are fully briefed. (D.I. 38, 45, 47; D.I. 40, 45, 48). All Defendants have filed a motion \nto sever the cases against each group. (D.I. 41 ). It too is fully briefed. (D.I. 42, 46, 49). \nDefendants raise a litany of reasons to dismiss the patent counts. They say the claims of \ndirect infringement are not plausible. (D.I. 38 at 9-14; D.I. 40 at 6-10). Neither are the claims of \nindirect infringement. (D.I. 38 at 14-16; D.I. 40 at 11-12). Neither are the claims of willful \ninfringement. (D.I. 38 at 16-17; D.I. 40 at 12-13). \nAll five patents assert systems claims. The amended complaint asserts that each \nDefendant offers for sale, or has sold the Pilot project, to the New York MT A. The allegations \nPage 1 of 5 Case 1:22-cv-00049-RGA   Document 51   Filed 03/22/23   Page 1 of 5 PageID #: 884of direct infringement are plausible for Siemens and Thales 1 (D.I. 32, ~ 65); not so for Humatics \nand Piper.2 Siemens relies on three summary judgment cases (D.I. 38 at 9-10), but they require \nmore than is required at the motion to dismiss stage of the case. It does not trouble me that \nPlaintiff relies upon allegations made pursuant to Rule 11 (b )(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure . Boilerplate invocations of the doctrine of equivalents as an alternative to literal \ninfringement are sufficient. \nThe allegations of indirect infringement and willful infringement are sufficient. Plaintiff \nidentified three of the five asserted patents to Defendants in a letter dated June 24, 2019. (D.I. 32 \nat 17). The filing of the original complaint in this case on January 13, 2022, provides notice of \nthe other two asserted patents as of that date. The allegations of knowledge and intent to infringe \nare sufficient for induced infringement , at least as of June 24, 2019, for the three patents named \nin that letter, and as of January 13, 2022, for the other two asserted patents. The same \nallegations, combined with the assertion of \"no substantial non-infringing uses\" is sufficient to \nsupport contributory infringement allegations from those dates. Finally, the willful infringement \nallegations are sufficient for the three asserted patents identified in the June 24, 2019, letter. See \nWrinkl, Inc. v. Facebook , Inc., 2021 WL 4477022 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021). \nPlaintiffs tortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim is preempted \nby federal patent law with respect to Humatics , Piper, and Thales. \"The patent laws will not \npreempt such claims if they include additional elements not found in the federal patent law cause \n1 Thales recently changed its name to Ground Transportation Systems USA, Inc. The motion and \nthe briefing refer to this party as Thales so I will do the same to avoid confusion. (D.I. 38 at 1 \nn.1). \n2 Allegations of direct infringement do not require much. See Disc Disease Sols. Inc. v. VGH \nSols., Inc., 888 F.3d 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nPage 2 of 5 Case 1:22-cv-00049-RGA   Document 51   Filed 03/22/23   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 885of action and if they are not an impermissible attempt to offer patent-like protection to subject \nmatter addressed by federal law.\" Rodime PLC v. Seagate Tech., Inc., 174 F.3d 1294, 1306 (Fed. \nCir. 1999). Plaintiffs complaint alleges Defendants interfered with Metrom's business \nexpectation \"by deliberately infringing Metrom's patents, or submitting proposals to the MTA \nknowing that they would inevitably infringe Metrom's patent rights in the future.\" (D.I. 32, ,r \n128). These acts are covered by federal patent law. Therefore, these claims are preempted with \nrespect to Humatics , Piper, and Thales. \nPlaintiff's tortious interference claim is not preempted with respect to Siemens. Plaintiff \nalleges Siemens \"improperly influenced the MTA to reject Metrom's bid, by obtaining Metrom's \nbid amount and by compensating consultants who lobbied the MTA for Siemens without \ndisclosing their affiliation with Siemens.\" (Id. at 91). These claims go beyond patent \ninfringement. Therefore , Plaintiff's claim against Siemens is not preempted by federal patent \nlaw. \nSiemens argues Plaintiff fails to allege a reasonable probability of business expectancy , \nintentional interference by Siemens, and improper conduct. (D.I. 38 at 19-20). \nPlaintiff has sufficiently pled facts to show a bona fide expectancy of a business \nrelationship with MT A. Plaintiff has alleged that there were only three parties bidding-Plaintiff , \nSiemens, and Thales (D.I. 32 at 11), that Plaintiff was well positioned to win the bid because it \nhad more experience than the other parties (id. at 9-11 ), and that it was invited to submit a bid by \nthe MTA (id. at 10). Based on these facts, I think it is reasonable to infer that Plaintiff had a bona \nfide expectancy of securing MT A's business. Cf Sustainable Energy Generation Grp. v. Photon \nEnergy Projects B. V, 2014 WL 2433096, at *15 (Del. Ch. May 30, 2014) (finding no reasonable \nPage 3 of 5 Case 1:22-cv-00049-RGA   Document 51   Filed 03/22/23   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 886expectancy for failure to describe the plaintiff's relationship with decisionmakers or the \ncompetitive landscape). \nPlaintiff has sufficientl y alleged intentional interference. Plaintiff alleges that Siemens \nwrongfully obtained Plaintiff's bid amount and improperl y lobbied, or paid consultants to lobby, \nthe MTA. (D.I. 32, ,r,r 38-39, 130). Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant \"conspired with the RFP \nauthors to alter the RFP and issue an RFP 'addendum ' favorable to Siemens. \" (Id. at ,r 40). \nAccepting the facts as true, and drawing reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs favor, I find that this \nplausibly alleges Siemens intentionall y interfered and committed wrongful conduct. \nTherefore , Plaintiff's claim of tortious interference against Siemens is sufficientl y pled, \nbut the claims against Thales, Piper, and Humatics are preempted. \nPlaintiff's claim for civil conspirac y against the parties is preempted by federal patent \nlaw. \"Under Delaware law, civil conspirac y requires: (1) A confederation or combination of two \nor more persons; (2) An unlawful act done in furtherance of the conspiracy; and (3) Actual \ndamage.\"3 Digene Corp. v. Ventana Med. Sys., Inc., 476 F. Supp. 2d 444,446 (D. Del. 2007) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff argues it has alleged an unlawful act \nthat is separate from patent infringement -tortious interference. (D.I. 45 at 26). \nWhile Plaintiff has stated a claim of tortious interference against Siemens, I do not read \nthe complaint to allege that it was done in furtherance of the conspirac y. Plaintiff's complaint \nalleges that Siemens improperl y lobbied the MTA and obtained Plaintiff's bid amount and that a \nDefendant \"conspired with the RFP authors to alter the RFP and issue an RFP 'addendum ' \nfavorable to Siemens. \" (D.I. 32 at 12). As discussed above, Plaintiff only alleges facts to \n3 I assume for present purposes Delaware law applies. There might be an argument that New \nYork law applies. \nPage 4 of 5 Case 1:22-cv-00049-RGA   Document 51   Filed 03/22/23   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 887plausibly show that \"Defendant \" refers to Siemens. Plaintiff alleges that a secret addendum \nissued that was favorable to Thales and Siemens, but that is not the same as alleging that the \nlobbying was done to create an addendum favorable to Thales. \nTherefore , Plaintiff's claim for civil conspirac y based on tortious interference fails \nbecause it does not plead an unlawful act done in furtherance of the conspirac y. To the extent the \ncomplaint alleges acts done in furtherance of a conspiracy between all Defendants to infringe \nPlaintiff's patents, the claim is preempted by federal patent law . \nThe motion to sever is granted. One case will be against Siemens and Humatics ; the \nother against Thales and Piper. \nTherefore , the motions to dismiss (D.I. 37, 39) are GRANTED in part and DENIED in \npart. The claims of direct infringement against Humatics and Piper are DISMISSED , Count VI \nis DISMISSED against Piper, Humatics , and Thales, and Count VII is DISMISSED against all \nDefendants. The motion to sever (D~l) is GRANTED.4 \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 1K day of March 2023. \n4 The Court cannot help but note that it appears that the case should be transferred to the \nSouthern District of New York, which would clearly have a much greater interest in a case that is \nall about the New York MT A, its bid processes, and Plaintiff's allegations of nefariousness in \nconnection with the same. Perhaps there is some reason why the case could not have been \nbrought there. Within two weeks, any party opposed to a transfer to the Southern District should \nfile a brief explaining why such transfer is either impermissible , or, if permissible , why the case \nshould nevertheless not be transferred . \nPage 5 of 5 Case 1:22-cv-00049-RGA   Document 51   Filed 03/22/23   Page 5 of 5 PageID #: 888"}
