(\"Pharmaceutical s, Inc.\"), Handa Pharma, Inc. (\"Pharma, Inc.\"), \nHanda Pharmaceuticals , LLC (\"Pharmaceutical s, LLC\"), and Handa Neuroscience , LLC \n(\"Neuroscience \" and, together with Pharmaceutical s, Inc., Pharma, Inc., and Pharmaceuticals , \nLLC \"Defendants \") (D.I. 9). Defendants move to dismiss the claims brought by Plaintiff \nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (\"Novartis\" or \"Plaintiff') against Pharmaceuticals , Inc., \nPharma, Inc., and Pharmaceuticals , LLC pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nand to dismiss the claims against Neuroscience under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(3). \n(Id) Alternatively , Defendants request that the Court transfer this matter in full to the Northern \nDistrict of California under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1404(a) and 1406(a). (Id) \nThe parties submitted briefing (see D.I. 10, 16, 27) and accompan ying exhibits, as well as \nletters regarding supplemental authority and subsequent developments (see D.I. 35-37, 39-40, \n42-43, 45-46). The Court held a teleconference on January 24, 2022 to hear argument from the \nparties. (D.I. 44) (\"Tr.\") \nHaving considered the parties' filings and arguments , and for the reasons stated below, \nthe Court will deny with prejudice Defendants ' motion as it pertains to the claims against \nPharmaceuticals, Inc., Pharma, Inc., and Pharmaceuticals , LLC, as well as Defendants ' request to \ntransfer this case. It will deny Defendants ' motion as it pertains to the claims against \nNeuroscience without prejudice to renew upon completion of venue-related discovery . \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis case arises out ofNeuroscience 's submission to the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration (\"FDA\") ofNDA No. 214962 (\"NDA\"), which seeks to market a version of \n1 GILENYA \u00ae, Novartis ' medicine for treating relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. (D.I. 1 ,r,r 1, \n7, 37) On May 4, 2021, Novartis filed suit under the Hatch-Waxman and Declaratory Judgment \nActs to enforce two patents covering GILENYA \u00ae: U.S. Patent Nos. 9,187,405 (the '\"405 \npatent\") and 10,543,179 (the\"' 179 patent\"). (Id. ,r 1) Two days later, Plaintiff filed a \"safety \nsuit\" in the Northern District of California , asserting the same two patents against the same four \nDefendants , purportedly to protect the Hatch-Waxman automatic 30-month stay of FDA \napproval of Defendants ' proposed drug product, regardless of the resolution of any venue dispute \nhere in Delaware , which is Novartis ' preferred District. See Novartis Pharms. Corp. v. Handa \nNeuroscience , LLC, C.A. No. 5:21-03397 (N.D. Cal.). \nNovartis is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in East Hanover, \nNew Jersey. (D.I. 1 ,r 2) \nTo understand the relationships among the Defendants , the various Handa entities, the \nfollowing diagram, recreated from Defendants ' opening brief (see D.I. 10 at 3; see also D.I. 20-1 \nEx. 33 at 84), is helpful: \nHanda Pharmaceuticals. Inc. \n(\"Pbannaceuticals . Inc.\") \n... \nHanda Pbanna. Inc. \n(\"Pharma. Inc.\") \n,. \nHanda Neuroscience . LLC \n(\"Nemoscience 'j \n2 Ir \nHanda Pharmaceuticals . LLC \n(\"Pharmaceuticals . LLC .. ) Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the parent company of the other three Defendants, is a Taiwanese \ncorporation with its principal place of business in Taiwan. (Id. ,r 3) Pharma, Inc. and \nPharmaceuticals, LLC are Delaware companies , while Neuroscience is a California company . \n(Id. ,r,r 4-6) All three subsidiaries have their principal place of business in San Jose, California, \nwhere they share an office. (Id. ,r,r 4-6, 13) \nPharmaceuticals , LLC was founded in 2005 by Dr. Fangyu Liu. (See D.I. 16 at 3) In \n2016, Pharmaceuticals , LLC joined with a Taiwanese company to bring Handa public. (See id.) \nThat parent company is Pharmaceuticals , Inc.; at the time, Pharmaceuticals, LLC became a U.S. \nsubsidiary . (See id.) Today, Pharmaceuticals , Inc. is Handa's headquarters and global research \nand development center, and Pharmaceuticals , LLC leads Handa's generics business. (D.I. 1 \n,r 12) \nBoth Neuroscience and Pharma, Inc. were created in July 2020. (Id. ,r 19; D.I. 16 at 5) \nDefendants assert that Neuroscience is responsible for Handa's new central nervous system drug \nproducts (see D.I. 10 at 3), but Novartis alleges Neuroscience is \"an empty shell with no \napproved products, no revenue, no employees , and no money\" (D.I. 16 at 5). Defendants \ncontend that Pharma, Inc. is a \"mere holding company for the U.S. subsidiaries\" (D.I. 10 at 2), \nbut Plaintiff alleges \"Pharma, Inc. is responsible for business development, intellectual property, \nand regulatory affairs\" of Handa (D.I. 1 ,r 12). \nIn August 2020, Pharmaceuticals , LLC transferred the NDA and related rights to \nNeuroscience. (See D.I. 16 at 5; D.I. 10 at 3) A securities filing from the same month, however, \nstates that the parent company (Pharmaceuticals , Inc.) \"still has substantial control over the \nproduct development progress and future benefits.\" (D.I. 20-1 Ex. 34) While Defendants \ncontend that Neuroscience bought the NDA from Pharmaceuticals , LLC for fair market value \n3 (D.I. 10-1 Ex. 1 (\"Cary Deel.\") ,r 7), Novartis argues the transfer involved no money (see D.I. 16 \nat 5). On December 18, 2020, Neuroscience submitted the NDA to FDA, where it remains under \nreview. (D.I. 1 ,r 21; Cary Deel. ,r,r 11-12) \nNovartis alleges that all four Defendants \"acted collaboratively in the preparation and \nsubmission of' Handa's application , and further that all four \"will work in concert with one \nanother to make, use, offer to sell, and/or sell\" Handa's proposed product. (D.I. 1 ,r 10) Novartis \nnotes, for example, that Pharmaceuticals , LLC corresponded with FDA in advance of submitting \nthe application and contracted with third parties to prepare test batches of the product and to \nconduct stability and other tests to be included as part of the application. (See D.I. 16 at 3) \nAdditionally , Pharmaceuticals , LLC is listed at various points in the NDA as the \"applicant.\" \n(Id. at 6) Novartis also contends that Defendants are under common control, noting that Dr. Liu \nserves the Handa constituent companies in all the following capacities: \"President\" and \n\"Chairman of the Board of Directors \" of Pharmaceuticals , Inc.; \"the President\" of Pharma, Inc.; \n\"the Manager\" of Pharmaceuticals , LLC; \"the CEO and agent for the service of process\" for \nNeuroscience; and the named inventor on patents purportedl y covering Handa's product. (D.I. 1 \n,r,r 14-16) \nDefendants seek dismissal of the claims against Pharmaceuticals , Inc., Pharma, Inc., and \nPharmaceuticals , LLC, arguing none of these entities is a \"submitter\" of the NDA at issue. They \nalso seek to dismiss the claims against Neuroscience on the ground that venue is improper in this \nDistrict with respect to Neuroscience . Alternatively, Defendants urge the Court to transfer this \ncase to the Northern District of California , where the parties have agreed venue is proper. \n4 II. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Motion To Dismiss Pursuant To Rule 12(b)(6) \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires \nthe Court to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 \nF.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir. 2004). \"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but \nwhether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\" In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F .3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThus, the Court may grant such a motion to dismiss only if, after \"accepting all well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, \nplaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F .3d 4 72, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe Court, however, is not obligated to accept as true \"bald assertions,\" Morse v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \n\"unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences ,\" Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pa. \nPower & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405,417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \"self-evidently \nfalse,\" Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1996). \nB. Motion To Dismiss Pursuant To Rule 12(b)(3) \nGenerally, \"venue provisions are designed, not to keep suits out of the federal courts, but \nmerely to allocate suits to the most appropriate or convenient federal forum.\" Brunette Mach. \nWorks, Ltd v. Kockum Indus., Inc., 406 U.S. 706, 710 (1972). A party believing it has been sued \nin an improper federal venue may move to dismiss or transfer venue under Rule 12(b)(3). See \nalso 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (stating that court granting Rule 12(b)(3) motion based on improper \nvenue \"shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or \n5 division in which it could have been brought\"). When such a motion is filed, the Court must \ndetermine whether venue is proper in accordance with the applicable statutes. See Albright v. \nWL. Gore & Assocs., Inc., 2002 WL 1765340, at *3 (D. Del. July 31, 2002). \nIn a patent infringement action, venue is governed solely and exclusively by the patent \nvenue statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(b). See TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Grp. Brands LLC, \n137 S. Ct. 1514, 1516 (2017). Section 1400(b) provides that a patent infringement action may be \nbrought only \"in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has \ncommitted acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\" \nGenerally , \"it is not necessary for the plaintiff to include allegations in his complaint \nshowing that venue is proper.\" Great W Mining & Min. Co. v. ADR Options, Inc., 434 F. App'x \n83, 86-87 (3d Cir. 2011). However , \"upon motion by the Defendant challenging venue in a \npatent case, the Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing proper venue.\" In re ZTE (USA) Inc., \n890 F.3d 1008, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The Court will accept any venue-related allegations in the \ncomplaint as true unless they are contradicted by the defendant 's evidence. See Bockman v. First \nAm. Mktg. Corp., 459 F. App'x 157, 158 n.1 (3d Cir. 2012); In re First Solar, Inc. Derivative \nLitig., 2013 WL 817132, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 4, 2013). In addition, the Court may consider \naffidavits submitted by the plaintiff. See Bockman, 459 F. App'x at 161. \nC. Motion To Transfer \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), a district court may transfer any civil action to any other \ndistrict where the action might have been brought, for the convenience of the parties and \nwitnesses and in the interests of justice. Congress intended through Section 1404 to place \ndiscretion in the district court to adjudicate motions to transfer according to an individualized , \ncase-by-case consideration of convenience and the interests of justice. See Stewart Org. v. Ricoh \n6 Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 29 (1988); Affymetrix , Inc. v. Synteni, Inc., 28 F. Supp. 2d 192,208 (D. Del. \n1998). \nUnless the balance of convenience strongly favors transfer, the plaintiffs choice of \nforum should prevail. See Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F .2d 22, 25 (3d Cir. 1970). Thus, \"a \ntransfer is not to be liberally granted.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The deference \nafforded a plaintiffs choice of forum will ordinarily apply as long as a plaintiff has selected the \nforum for some legitimate reason. See, e.g., Medtronic , Inc. v. Boston Sci. Corp., 587 F. Supp. \n2d 648,654 (D. Del. 2008); Cypress Semiconductor Corp. v. Integrated Cir. Sys., Inc., 2001 WL \n1617186, at *2 (D. Del. Nov. 28, 2001). It follows that \"transfer will be denied if the factors are \nevenly balanced or weigh only slightly in favor of the transfer.\" Angiodynamics, Inc. v. Vascular \nSols., Inc., 2010 WL 3037478, at *2 (D. Del. July 30, 2010) (internal citations omitted). \nAlthough \"there is no definitive formula or list of the factors to consider\" in assessing \nwhether to transfer, typically a series of private and public interests are evaluated. See Jumara v. \nState Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995). The private interests include: \n(1) plaintiffs forum preference as manifested in the original choice; (2) defendant's preference; \n(3) whether the claim arose elsewhere; ( 4) the convenience of the parties as indicated by their \nrelative physical and financial condition; ( 5) the convenience of the witnesses but only to the \nextent they may actually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and ( 6) the location of books \nand records (similarly limited to the extent that the files could not be produced in the alternative \nforum). See id. The public interests include: (1) the enforceability of the judgment; (2) practical \nconsiderations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive; (3) the relative \nadministrative difficulty in the two fora resulting from court congestion; (4) the local interest in \n7 deciding local controversies at home; (5) the public policies of the fora; and (6) the familiarity of \nthe trial judge with the applicable state law in diversity cases. See id. at 879-80. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nAs an initial matter, as the Court noted at the hearing (see Tr. at 15-16), Plaintiffs motion \nfor leave to file a sur-reply brief in support of its opposition to Defendants' motion (see D.I. 29) \nis granted. The Court reiterates that having the parties' arguments on the issues raised by \nPlaintiffs motion is far more helpful in this case than would be striking the sur-reply brief. (See \nTr. at 16) Accordingly, the Court has considered the parties' filings and arguments relating to \nthat motion (see D.I. 29-1) in addressing Defendants ' motion. \nA. Defendants' \"Submitter\" Status \nDefendants Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pharma, Inc., and Pharmaceuticals, LLC seek \ndismissal of the claims against them because, they contend, none of these entities is a \n\"submitter\" of the NDA at issue, as that term is used in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A). \nSection 271 ( e )(2)(A) makes it an act of infringement to \"submit\" an application \"if the \npurpose of such submission is to ... engage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale\" of the \ngeneric drug. An entity who \"submits\" an NDA has committed an \"act of infringement\" and is a \nproper defendant in a Hatch-Waxman patent lawsuit. See Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 \nU.S. 661, 678 (1990). \nIt is undisputed that Neuroscience , and not any of the other three Defendants, signed and \nphysically submitted the NDA. (See Tr. at 19) An entity, however, need not sign, prepare, or \nfile an NDA to be a \"submitter.\" See Helsinn Healthcare SA. v. Hospira, Inc., 2016 WL \n1338601, at *7 (D.N.J. Apr. 5, 2016). Rather, an entity may also \"submit\" an NDA if it \nparticipates in the preparation of the NDA and stands to benefit from the FDA's approval of the \n8 application. See Celgene Corp. v. Mylan Pharms. Inc., 17 F.4th 1111, 1129 (Fed. Cir. 2021) \n(citing In re Rosuvastatin Calcium Patent Litig., 703 F.3d 511 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); see also \nAdverio Pharma GmbHv. Alembic Pharms. Ltd, 2019 WL 581618, at *4-5 (D. Del. Feb. 13, \n2019). \nNovartis alleges that all four Defendants \"acted collaboratively in the preparation and \nsubmission of' the NDA and \"will work in concert with one another to make, use, offer to sell, \nand/or sell\" Neuroscience's proposed product. (D.I. 1 ,r 10) Defendants describe these \nallegations as \"conclusory \" and similar to the allegations found insufficient by this Court in \nAdverio, 2019 WL 581618, at *6, and by the Federal Circuit in Celgene, 17 F.4th at 1129. (See \nD.I. 10 at 6; Tr. at 22) In the Court's view, however, Novartis has not simply (and insufficientl y) \nstated legal conclusions as to the defendants as a group; rather, it has pled facts demonstrating a \nplausible inference of liability as to each of the defendants. (See Tr. at 51) (Novartis explaining \nthat, while Complaint contains some \"group pleadings ,\" those follow from other allegations \nspecific to each Defendant) \nFor example, as to Pharmaceuticals , Inc., Novartis highlights an August 2020 securities \nfiling1 stating that, despite the transfer of the NDA from Pharmaceuticals , LLC to Neuroscience , \nthe parent company , Pharmaceuticals, Inc., \"still has substantial control over the product \ndevelopment progress and future benefits.\" (D.I. 20-1 Ex. 34) Defendants concede that \nPharmaceuticals , Inc. is Handa's global research and development center, adding to the \nplausibility of Novartis' contention that Pharmaceuticals , Inc. played a significant role in \n1 Although this securities filing is not attached to the Complaint , the Court may take judicial \nnotice ofit. See In re NAHC, Inc. Sec. Litig., 306 F.3d 1314, 1331 (3d Cir. 2002). Defendants \ndo not appear to dispute the Court's ability to do so. (See Tr. at 32, 42) \n9 research and development relating to the NDA. (See D.I. 1 ,r 12) In particular , Novartis alleges \nthat Pharmaceuticals , Inc. manufactured a pilot batch of the NDA product in 2018. (Id ,r 17) \nAs to Pharma, Inc., Plaintiff argues that Handa' s pursuit of its NDA product has required \nall of Pharma, Inc.' s functions , which are -as alleged in the Complaint - \"business development , \nintellectual property, and regulatory affairs\" (id ,r 12). (See Tr. at 59) Moreover , Novartis \nalleges that, in submitting the NDA, Neuroscience \"acted as an agent for and at the direction and \ncontrol of ... Pharmaceuticals , Inc., including through its other agent[] Handa Pharma, Inc. [i.e., \nPharma, Inc.].\" (D.I. 1 ,r 22) Relatedly, Novartis asserts that the disclosure in the securities \nfiling describing Pharmaceuticals , Inc.'s \"substantial control\" (D.I. 20-1 Ex. 34) over Handa's \nNDA product implicates Pharma, Inc., too, as Pharma, Inc. is \"the intermediary necessary to \nexert 'substantial control\"' (D.I. 16 at 11-12; see Tr. at 41). \nAs to Pharmaceuticals , LLC, Novartis alleges it is responsible for Handa's generics \nbusiness (D.I. 1 ,r 12), that it corresponded with the FDA before the NDA was submitted , and \nthat it was listed at various times in the NDA as the \"applicant \" (see D.I. 16 at 3, 6). Novartis \nalso claims that Neuroscience acquired the NDA on credit and suggests Pharmaceuticals , LLC \nwill not get paid until sales of the NDA product begin. (See id at 12) Moreover , Novartis \nasserts that both Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Pharmaceut icals, Inc. contracted with third parties \nfor test batches of the product and to conduct various tests to be included as part of the NDA. \n(See id at 3) Finally, Plaintiff points to financial statements stating that the Handa Group is \n\"essentially a continuation of the legal subsidiary Handa Pharmaceuticals , LLC [i.e., \nPharmaceuticals , LLC].\" (Id. at 12) (citing, e.g., D.I. 20-1 Ex. 31 at 68, Ex. 32 at 70, Ex. 33 at \n65) \n10 Additionally, while insufficient on its own to confer \"submitter \" status to the three \nDefendants pressing this portion of the motion, there is ample evidence that they are all part of \nthe same corporate family as Neuroscience . For example, Novartis points to common control of \nDefendants by Dr. Liu as well as the subsidiaries ' shared office. See Cephalon , Inc. v. Watson \nPharms., Inc., 629 F. Supp. 2d 338,349 (D. Del. 2009) (\"Parties 'actively involved' in preparing \nthe ANDA are deemed to have 'submit[ted]' the ANDA, regardless of whether they are the \nnamed applicant; this is especially true where the parties involved are in the same corporate \nfamily.\"); see also Otsuka Pharm. Co. v. Hetero USA, Inc., 2020 WL 6822971, at *2-3 (D. Del. \nNov. 20, 2020) (upholding complaint against \"vertically integrated \" non-filer that \"share[d] one \nor more common corporate directors\" with filer; parties constituted \"a unitary entity and \noperate[ d] as a single integrated business with respect to the regulatory approval, manufacturing , \nmarketing, sale and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products; \" and non-filer would \n\"work[] in unison\" with filer, including after FDA approval). This provides additional support \nfor the Court's conclusion. \nIn sum, the Court disagrees with Defendants that Plaintiff has \"'lump[ed] multiple \ndefendants together without providing allegation s of individual conduct.\"' (See D.I. 10 at 6) \n(quoting Adverio, 2019 WL 581618, at *6) Rather, Plaintiff has pled facts with sufficient \nspecificity to support its plausible allegations that each Defendant actively participated in the \npreparation of the NDA and intends to benefit from its approval. Accordingly , Pharmaceutical s, \nInc., Pharma, Inc., and Pharmaceuticals , LLC are proper defendants in this lawsuit. The Court \nwill deny the motion as it pertains to the claims against these three Defendants.2 \n2 The declaration of Stephen Cary, Pharma, Inc.' s Chief Operating Officer, which Defendants \nurge the Court to consider, does not alter the Court's conclusion. (See Tr. at 23) (pointing \nspecifically to Cary Deel. 1 15) First, as Plaintiff points out, the Court cannot consider this \n11 B. Venue Under\u00a7 1400(b) \nNeuroscience seeks to dismiss the claims against it on the ground that venue is improper \nin this District.3 Novartis does not dispute that Neuroscience neither resides in nor has a regular \nand established place of business in Delaware. (See D.I. 1 ,r 6) (alleging that Neuroscience is \nCalifornia company with its principal place of business in California) Instead, Novartis argues \nvenue is proper because (1) Randa is using Neuroscience to manipulate venue, and (2) piercing \nthe corporate veil to find venue in Delaware is warranted here. \n1. Manipulation of Venue \nFirst, Novartis argues that Randa created Neuroscience solely to escape venue in this \nDistrict, asserting that \"an experienced litigant like Randa would know [that] Hatch-Waxman \nlitigation was likely\" at the time it created Neuroscience. (D.I. 16 at 14) In a sworn declaration , \nhowever, Defendants provide an explanation for the creation of Neuroscience in July 2020, nine \nmonths before Novartis filed the Complain t. (See Cary Deel. ,r 7) Randa purportedly \nreorganized to separate its generic and brand interests, and in the process assigned responsibility \nto Neuroscience for new central nervous system drug products. (Id.; see also Tr. at 20) \nRanda also chose to incorporate Neuroscience in California because it is the state of \nRanda's \"nerve center.\" (See D.I. 27 at 4-5) Defendants argue that, even if this decision were \nmade in order to avoid being sued outside of California , business entities are entitled to consider \ndeclaration in connection with the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss without converting it into a \nmotion for summary judgment -which Defendants have not requested doing. (See id. at 50) \nSecond, even if the Court were to consider the declaration , it would still reach the same \nconclusion, given its duty at this stage to view the allegations in the Complaint in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiff. \n3 Defendants do not dispute that venue as to the other three Defendants is proper. (See D.I. 16 at \n12) \n12 such factors when choosing their state of incorporation. See Cradle IP, LLC v. Tex. Instrument s, \nInc., 923 F. Supp. 2d 696, 699 (D. Del. 2013). Further, they argue this case can be distinguished \nfrom In re Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., 2 F.4th 1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2021), and the others on \nwhich Novartis relies, in which the plaintiff, rather than the defendant , was accused of \nmanipulating venue. See id. at 1377 (\"[I]n ascertaining proper venue, we are not bound by a \nplaintiff's efforts to manipulate venue.\") (emphasis added). As Novartis noted at the hearing, \nhowever, a Hatch-Waxman suit is unique in that the applicant \"gets the ball rolling\" -that is, the \napplicant (accused infringer) files an application with FDA knowing it will almost certainly \ntrigger a process that leads to a lawsuit against it. (Tr. at 53) The Court agrees with Novartis \nthat, in the context of this Hatch-Waxman suit, the rationale underlying In re Samsung has at \nleast some application to Defendants here. \nNotwithstanding this conclusion , the Court is unable to make a finding, on the record \npresently before it, that Handa created Neuroscience solely to escape venue. As the Court will \nexplain in further detail below, bef9re it can make such a finding, it will provide Novartis an \nopportunity to take venue-related discovery. \n2. Piercing the Corporate Veil \nSecond, Novartis argues Randa's corporate veil should be pierced and, on this basis, too, \nNeuroscience should be required to litigate in this District with the other Handa companies. See \nMinn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Eco Chem, Inc., 757 F.2d 1256, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (\"[P]iercing \nthe corporate veil is appropriate in order to establish venue under the patent venue statutes.\"). \n13 \"Corporate separateness is an issue ofregional-circuit law.\" Celgene, 17 F.4th at 1125. \nAccordingly , Third Circuit law applies here.4 \nThe test used in the Third Circuit to determine if veil piercing is warranted is often \nreferred to as the alter ego test. See id. Pursuant to the applicable analysis, courts will pierce the \ncorporate veil (i.e., disregard the corporate form) to \"prevent fraud, illegality, or injustice, when \nrecognition of the corporate entity would defeat public policy ... , or when the parent so \ndominated the subsidiary that it had no separate existence.\" Id. (internal quotation marks \nomitted); see also Trs. of Nat'! Elevator Indus. Pension, Health Benefit & Educ. Funds v. Lutyk, \n332 F.3d 188, 194 (3d Cir. 2003). Additional relevant considerations include: \"gross \nundercapitalization , failure to observe corporate formalities , nonpayment of dividends , \ninsolvency of debtor corporation , siphoning of funds from the debtor corporation by the \ndominant stockholder , nonfunctioning of officers and directors, absence of corporate records, \nand whether the corporation is merely a facade for the operations of the dominant stockholder. \" \nPearson v. Component Tech. Corp., 247 F.3d 471, 484-85 (3d Cir. 2001). \nContrary to Defendants ' suggestion , an absence of fraud is not \"fatal\" to an effort at veil\u00ad\npiercing .5 (See D.l. 27 at 6-7 & n.1) Rather, the presence of a number of the above factors can \n4 The parties appear to dispute which body of substantive law the Court should apply. \nDefendants rely on Third Circuit law (see D.l. 10 at 10-11), while Plaintiff contends that Federal \nCircuit law governs since the policies of the federal patent venue statute are at issue (see D.l. 16 \nat 15). Neither party, however, argues there are material differences between those Circuits with \nrespect to the law governing corporate separateness. Defendants \"don't think there's any \ndifference\" (Tr. at 36), and Novartis concedes that \"the law is similar in both Circuits\" (D.I. 16 at \n15 n.8). To the extent there are differences, they are immaterial to the Court's analysis. \n5 Defendants note the Third Circuit has explained that '\"where the conduct alleged to justify \npiercing the corporate veil is that the corporation as a whole is a 'sham' or 'facade,' a finding \n'akin to ... fraud' is necessary. \"' (D.I. 31 at 8) (quoting Lutyk, 332 F.3d at 194 n.7) While \nNovartis does allege that Neuroscience 's existence is a \"sham\" intended to manipulate venue, it \nalso argues separately that Randa seeks to shield culpable parties from liability (see D.l. 16 at \n14 establish that an injustice or unfairnes s exists and justifies veil piercing. See Int 'l Bus. Machines \nCorp. v. Expedia, Inc., 2019 WL 3322542, at *4 (D. Del. July 24, 2019), report and \nrecommendation adopted, 2019 WL 4635137 (D. Del. Sept. 24, 2019); see also Lutyk, 332 F.3d \nat 194. \n\"Alter ego must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.\"6 Lutyk, 332 F.3d at 194 \n(internal punctuation omitted). Plaintiff must show that the entities' separateness \"is little more \nthan a legal fiction,\" a task which is \"notoriousl y difficult\" to achieve. Pearson, 247 F.3d at 485. \nPlaintiff \"must essentially demonstrate that in all aspects of the business , the two corporations \nactually functioned as a single entity.\" Id. \nIn support of its argument for veil piercing, Novartis relies heavily on a declaration from \nits forensic accountant , Kenneth Mathieu. 7 (See D.I. 16 at 16-18) ( citing D.I. 17 (\"Mathieu \nDeel.\")) Mr. Mathieu describes Neuroscience 's undercapitalization and insolvency , opining that \nthe company has no money, products, or revenue, and owes large debts to others in the Randa \n16) and aims to achieve inconsistent results with respect to the '405 patent (see Tr. at 57). \nConsidering these additional allegations , the Court concludes that an absence of fraud would not \nnecessarily be \"fatal\" to Novartis' veil-piercing argument. \n6 Plaintiff urges the Court to apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, citing a criminal \nappeal to the Eleventh Circuit in support. (D.I. 16 at 13) (citing United States v. De La Cruz \nSuarez, 601 F.3d 1202, 1217 (11th Cir. 2010) (\"For purposes of venue, the government must \nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that the crimes occurred within the district of trial.\")) \nBecause the Court is addressing an issue of corporate separateness , it applies the regional law of \nthe Third Circuit, including the standard of proof required in this Circuit. \n7 The parties appear to disagree as to whether the Court can consider the Mathieu declaration in \nresolving the dispute over venue. (Compare Tr. at 29 (Defendants representing they \"don't \nreally think\" Court can consider it) with id. at 49 (Plaintiff stating that Court can \"for sure\" \nconsider it in relation to venue dispute)) The Court agrees with Novartis: when confronted with \na motion to dismiss for improper venue, the Court may consider evidence outside the complaint , \nincluding affidavits (like the Mathieu declaration ) submitted by the plaintiff. See Bristol-M yers \nSquibb Co. v. Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc., 2018 WL 5109836, at *2 (D. Del. Oct. 18, 2018) \n(citing Bockman , 459 F. App'x at 161). \n15 group. (Mathieu Deel. ,r,r 49-60) He asserts that Dr. Liu and the companies he controls \n(Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pharma, Inc., and Pharmaceuticals , LLC) dominate and control \nNeuroscience. (Id. ,r,r 61-69) He further explains that Neuroscience has no employees and \nappears not to pay for work by employees of other companies. (Id. ,r,r 70-85) Neuroscience also \npurportedly has no officers and directors who are not also officers and directors of other Handa \ncompanies. (Id. ,r,r 39-44, 87) Additionally , Mr. Mathieu states that Handa shuttles money \namong the different companies and fails to observe corporate formalities. (Id. ,r,r 35-36, 47, 51-\n53, 58, 63-65, 80-86) \nMore broadly, Novartis argues that Defendants aim to shield culpable parties from \nliability (see D.I. 16 at 16) and alleges that Defendants are searching for a court to provide them \nwith inconsistent results with respect to the '405 patent (see Tr. at 57; see also id. at 54 (\"[T]his \ncomes against the backdrop of Novartis litigating these patents; especially the '405 patent in this \ndistrict for years successfully. And Handa sees that going on. And then after 15 years in the \nUnited States of doing business through a Delaware entity, all of a sudden [it] creates a \nCalifornia entity .... It looks to us that the facts are clear that this is all about manipulation.\")). \nDefendants respond that \"[d]ismissing this action and allowing Novartis to proceed in \nCalifornia where it has filed an identical complaint ( or transferring this action to California) is \nneither fraudulent , unjust, nor inequitable and does not shield any entity from liability.\" (D.I. 27 \nat 6) As the Court noted in International Business Machines Corp. v. Expedia, Inc., \"if the \nMotion is granted and [Defendants] are dismissed from this case, that does not mean that these \nDefendants will be able to 'shield themselves from infringement' .... Plaintiff could certainly \npursue liability as to these Defendants in another federal district.\" 2019 WL 3322542, at *7. \n16 The Court agrees with Defendants that requiring Novartis to sue elsewhere is not the type \nof \"injustice \" that, in and of itself, warrants veil piercing. See id.; see also Mobil Oil Corp. v. \nLinear Films, Inc., 718 F. Supp. 260,270 (D. Del. 1989) (\"[R]equiring [Plaintiff] to enforce its \npatent rights against [Defendant] in another forum is not the kind of injustice -if, indeed, it is an \ninjustice at all -which warrants piercing the corporate veil.\"). This, however, does not end the \ninquiry. That is because, largely through Mr. Mathieu's declaration, Novartis has stated a non\u00ad\nfrivolous basis for venue. Thus, while the Court is unable to find on the present record that \nDelaware is a proper venue in which Novartis may proceed against Neuroscience , Novartis has \nmade a sufficient showing to persuade the Court that venue-related discovery may reveal some \n\"injustice\" or \"unfairness \" of the type that piercing the corporate veil was designed to prevent. \n3. Venue-Related Discovery \n\"[I]n a difficult case, the Court should permit venue-related discovery, to allow the \nadversarial process to aid the Court in making a fact-specific decision on a well-developed \nfactual record.\" Javelin Pharms., Inc. v. Mylan Labs. Ltd., 2017 WL 5953296, at *3 (D. Del. \nDec. 1, 2017). In the context of jurisdictional discovery, the Third Circuit has instructed that \n\"unless a plaintiffs claim is 'clearly frivolous,' jurisdictional discovery should be allowed.\" \nRocke v. Pebble Beach Co., 541 F. App'x 208,212 (3d Cir. 2013). A plaintiff, however, may \nnot \"undertake a fishing expedition based only upon bare allegations , under the guise of \njurisdictional discovery.\" Eurofins Pharma US Holdings v. BioAlliance Pharma SA, 623 F.3d \n147, 157 (3d Cir. 2010). The Court applies these same standards to venue discovery . See \nExpedia, 2019 WL 3322542, at *3. To show that discovery is warranted, a party must, at a \nminimum, state a non-frivolous basis for venue and do so with \"reasonable particularity. \" E.g., \nEastman Chem. Co. v. AlphaPet , Inc., 2011 WL 6004079, at *2 (D. Del. Nov. 4, 2011). Plaintiff \n17 has stated non-frivolous bases for venue: namely, that Handa created Neuroscience solely to \nescape venue or, relatedly, that Randa's conduct amounts to an \"injustice\" or \"unfairness\" that \nrequires piercing its corporate veil. \nNovartis argues that venue-related discovery will shed light on, for example, whether \nNeuroscience must repay loans used to pay the FDA filing fee or to purchase the NDA-and, if \nso, if it will repay those loans through sales of the NDA product. (See Tr. at 44) Mr. Mathieu \nalso identifies several documents in Defendants ' possession that could aid in the veil-piercing \ninquiry. (See Mathieu Deel. ,r 88 & tbl.12) Moreover , Novartis alerted the Court that on \nNovember 22, 2021, Handa produced confidential documents in the related California action that \nNovartis believes are relevant to the instant motion. (See D.I. 37) Handa allegedly \"refused to \npermit\" Novartis to submit those documents to the Court for consideration. (Id. at 2) Through \nvenue-related discovery, the parties can determine whether those documents will be relevant and \nhelpful to the Court's venue analysis. \nDefendants' recent disclosures in the California case further support granting venue\u00ad\nrelated discovery. None of the ten custodians identified by Defendants as most likely to have \ndiscoverable information are employed by Neuroscience , and the two electronic systems likely to \ncontain relevant data are not owned by Neuroscience. (See D.I. 45 Ex. A) In Novartis' view, \nthese disclosures support its argument that Neuroscience is not truly an independent company \nand was created to manipulate venue. (See D.I. 45 at 1-2) Novartis further argues that an \nabsence of any public record of an agreement between Pharma, Inc. and Neuroscience to allocate \nsalary and wages for individuals employed by Pharma, Inc. who perform work for Neuroscience \nsuggests a failure to observe corporate formalities. (Id. at 2) While venue-related discovery may \nwell, as Defendants suggest, reveal facts demonstrating the opposite (see D.I. 46), these \n18 disclosures contribute to the Court's finding that Plaintiff has stated non-frivolous bases for \nvenue. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny the motion without prejudice as it pertains to whether \nvenue in this District is proper over Neuroscience and allow Novartis to pursue venue-related \ndiscovery. While the parties are engaged in such discovery , and briefing any renewed motion to \ndismiss for lack of improper venue (should Neuroscience believe it has a good faith basis to do \nso), this case will move forward on the merits. The merits-related issues will have to be resolved \neventually in some district (so discovery taken here will likely be helpful to the ultimate \nresolution of this case, in whichever venue the case is resolved) and, as Novartis noted, time is \nrunning on its 30-month stay. (See Tr. at 62) \nC. Convenience Of The Forum \nFinally, Defendants contend that Delaware - even if it is a proper forum, including for \nNeuroscience -is not a convenient forum and ask the Court to transfer the case against all of \nthem to the Northern District of California. (See D.I. 10 at 12-15) In determining whether \ntransfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1404(a) is appropriate , the Court must first determine whether an \naction could have been brought in the proposed transferee venue. The parties agree that venue is \nproper in the Northern District of California. Indeed, Novartis has filed suit against all four \nDefendants there. \nTherefore, this portion of Defendants ' motion turns on the second step of the analysis, \nwhich requires a balancing of various private and public interest factors. As the moving party, \nDefendants bear the burden of demonstrating that the balance of convenience strongly favors \ntransfer to the Northern District. The Court finds that Defendants have not made such a \nshowing. \n19 1. Private Interest Factors \nThe private interest factors weigh against transfer. Plaintiff prefers to litigate in this \nforum, and, in general, a plaintiffs choice of forum is entitled to \"paramount consideration. \" \nShutte, 431 F.2d at 25. While Novartis brought identical suits in this District and in the Northern \nDistrict, the Northern District suit is merely a \"safety suit\" to protect the Hatch-Waxman 30-\nmonth stay regardless of the venue in which the suit eventually proceeds.8 (D.I. 16 at 7) \nNovartis chose to file this suit in Delaware for legitimate and rational reasons, including that \nvenue is indisputably proper against three of the four Defendants (see id. at 12), and much \nrelated GILENYA \u00ae litigation is proceeding or has proceeded here. In the Court's view, \nPlaintiffs choice of Delaware receives strong weight in the balance notwithstanding the filing of \nthe California suit (which was simply for the purpose of preserving the automatic stay). \nDefendants prefer the Northern District of California because their \"nerve center\" is \nthere. (D.I. 10 at 14) Their employees , prospective witnesses, and relevant documents are there. \n(Id.) These are legitimate and rational reasons for their preference for an alternative forum. See, \ne.g., Papst Licensing GmbH & Co. KG v. Lattice Semiconductor Corp., 126 F. Supp. 3d 430, \n8 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, in order to obtain the automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval \nof a competing drug product, a branded drug company like Novartis must file suit within 45 days \nafter receiving notice from a generic drug company like Handa that it has filed an Abbreviated \nNew Drug Application. See Eli Lilly & Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 557 F.3d 1346, 1348 \n(Fed. Cir. 2009). A typical strategy for branded companies that anticipate potential venue or \njurisdictional disputes is to file a case in their preferred district, here Delaware, and shortly \nthereafter (but, importantly , within the 45-day window) in a district in which they know there \ncan be no venue or jurisdictional challenge. See, e.g., Abbott Labs. v. Mylan Pharms., Inc., 2006 \nWL 850916, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 2006) (explaining appeal of\"protective\" ANDA suits, \nconsidering that \"patent holders are stuck between a jurisdictional rock and hard place: file suit \nin the forum of choice but risk losing patent protection if the suit is dismissed ... , or file suit in \nthe only known safe forum and incur all the inconvenience of litigating the matter in a distant \nlocation\"). \n20 438-39 (D. Del. 2015). Defendants' preference , however, is not given nearly the same weight as \nPlaintiffs. See Intel!. Ventures I LLC v. Altera Corp., 842 F. Supp. 2d 744, 755 (D. Del. 2012). \nNovartis contends that the claim arose \"with Delaware companies infringing patent rights \nowned by another Delaware company \" (D.I. 16 at 19), while Defendants counter that the claim \narose in California, from the submission of the NDA (D.I. 10 at 14). An assessment of where a \npatent infringement claim arose typically focuses on where the accused product was produced, \ndesigned, and manufactured. See Papst, 126 F. Supp. 3d at 439. As there is no evidence that \nHanda's NDA product was developed or will be manufactured in Delaware, this factor weighs \nslightly in favor of transfer. \nAs to \"the convenience of the parties as indicated by their relative physical and financial \ncondition,\" Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879, Defendants note that Novartis is one of the largest \npharmaceutical companies in the world, while Defendants, collectively, are small pharmaceutical \ncompanies with around 50 total employees worldwide , just 10 employees in the United States, \nand less than $10 million9 in average annual revenue. (Cary Deel. ,r 10) Despite Handa's \nrelatively smaller size and the fact that its \"nerve center\" is in the Northern District of California, \nit has not shown that \"litigating in Delaware would pose a unique or unusual burden on [its] \noperations.\" L 'Athene, Inc. v. EarthSpring LLC, 570 F. Supp. 2d 588, 592 (D. Del. 2008) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, Novartis points out that Handa has litigated other \nHatch-Waxman cases in this District and in nearby New Jersey without objection, and that \nHanda's counsel routinely appears in this Court. (See D.I. 16 at 19) This factor is neutral. \n9 There is a discrepancy between Mr. Cary's declaration , which estimates that this figure is \"less \nthan $10 million\" (Cary Deel. ,r 10), and Defendants ' opening brief, which places this figure at \n\"less than $5 million\" (D.I. 10 at 14). Either figure demonstrates Randa's smaller size in relation \nto Novartis. \n21 Finally, the parties have not identified any reason that the witnesses and documents \nwould be unavailable in either forum. \nAs a whole, then, the private interest factors weigh against transfer. \n2. Public Interest Factors \nDefendants argue that the Court should transfer this case to the Northern District to \nobviate the need to resolve the pending disputes regarding the Defendants ' \"submitter\" status \nand whether venue is proper over Neuroscience. (See D.I. 27 at 1) (citing Pfizer Inc. v. Apotex, \nInc., 2009 WL 2843288, at *3 (D. Del. Aug. 13, 2009) (\"Courts have routinely held that both \njudicial economy and the interest of justice favor transfer where transferring a case would \nobviate a substantial question regarding personal jurisdiction.\")) The Court is not persuaded by \nDefendants ' reliance on Pfizer. Transferring this case would not obviate the need for some \nCourt to resolve substantial jurisdictional questions -including whether Pharmaceuticals , Inc., \nPharma, Inc., and Pharmaceuticals , LLC are \"submitters \" under Section 271(e)(2)(A), as well as \nthe issue of veil piercing, as these issues are -at least according to Novartis -\"directly relevant \nto the merits,\" evidently a reference to corporate state of mind, which may need to be proven as \npart of an indirect infringement case. (Tr. at 55) Some federal judge would have to resolve these \nissues regardless of where this case proceeds . Thus, practical considerations like judicial \neconomy do not weigh in favor of transfer. \nNor do the remaining Jumara factors. Plaintiff contends that Delaware is the corporate \n\"home\" for most of the parties, and that Delaware has an interest in adjudicating disputes among \nits corporate citizens. (D.I. 16 at 20; see Altera, 842 F. Supp. 2d at 760) In patent infringement \ncases, the \"local interest\" factor is typically neutral, as patent litigation usually does not implicate \n22 local interests. See Intel!. Ventures I LLC v. Checkpoint Software Techs. Ltd., 797 F. Supp. 2d \n472,486 (D. Del. 2011). The local interest factor here is neutral. \nDefendants suggest this Court's heavy Hatch-Waxman caseload gives rise to \nadministrative difficulty and weighs in favor of transfer. (See D.I. 10 at 14-15) Weighing \nagainst this concern, however, are the facts that the judges in this Court are highly experienced \nwith Hatch-Waxman litigation and at least several judges in this District have specific familiarity \nwith GILENYA\u00ae and Novartis' patents related to it. This factor is neutral. \nThe enforceability of the judgment , public policies of the fora, and the trial judge's \nfamiliarity with the applicable state law are also neutral ( and the parties do not suggest \notherwise). \nIn sum, then, the public interest factors are neutral. When combined with the fact that the \nprivate interest factors disfavor transfer, it is clear that Defendants have failed to satisfy their \nburden to show that the balance of convenience factors and interests of justice weigh strongly in \nfavor of transfer. See Shutte, 431 F.2d at 25. Accordingly , the motion to transfer venue will be \ndenied. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny with prejudice Defendants' motion as it \npertains to the claims against Pharmaceuticals , Inc., Pharma, Inc., and Pharmaceuticals, LLC, \nand Defendants' request to transfer this case. It will deny without prejudice Defendants ' motion \nas it pertains to whether Delaware is an appropriate forum for Novartis' claims against \nNeuroscience, and it will grant Novartis' request for venue-related discovery . The Court intends \nto enter a schedule that will require this case to proceed through discovery and toward trial in \n23 parallel with any discovery and further litigation relating to Neuroscience and venue. An \nappropriate Order follows. \n24 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nNOV ARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS \nCORPORATION , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nHANDA NEUROSCIENCE , LLC, HANDA \nPHARMACEUTICALS , INC., HANDA \nPHARMA, INC., and HANDA \nPHARMACEUTICALS , LLC, \nDefendants . \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 1st day of March, 2022: C.A.
