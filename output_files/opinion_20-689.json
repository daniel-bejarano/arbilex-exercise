Andrews  \nANDREWS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore me is Defendants\u2019 m otion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  (D.I. 34). \nDefendants Lenovo (United States) Inc. (\u201cLenovo U.S.\u201d) and Lenovo (Beijing) Ltd. (\u201cLenovo \nBeijing\u201d)  argue Plaintiff LiTL\u2019s First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) (D.I. 31) fails to state a claim \non two grounds: (1) the Asserted Patents are directed to ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101, and (2) as to Lenovo Beijing, LiTL fails to state a claim of induced infringement and willful infringement. ( Id.). \nThe Section 101 issue was fully briefed for Lenovo U.S.\u2019s first m otion to dismis s. (D.I. 10, \n11, 16, 19).  After Lenovo Beijing filed a separate Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 24) and LiTL filed its \nFAC , the parties stipulated,  and I agreed , that I would consider the previously filed Section 101 \nmotion and accompanying briefing as though it had been refiled in response to the FAC . (D.I. 33 ). \nLenovo Beijing joins in Lenovo U.S.\u2019s Section 101 motion.  (D.I. 34 at 1).  Lenovo Beijing also  \nbrings its own motion  to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (Id.). Both issues have been fully \nbriefed and I have reviewed the parties \u2019 briefing.\n1 (D.I. 11, 16, 19, 35, 36, 37, 39 Ex. A, 40, 41).  \n \n1  I agree with LiTL  that Lenovo Beijing argued for the first time in its Reply that causation \nmust be pled separately from \u201cintent to cause infringement\u201d to successfully plead induced \ninfringement. Although Lenovo Beijing states in its Opening Brief, \u201cLiTL fails to plead any facts demonstrating that Lenovo Beijing possessed specific intent to induce infringement or that any inducing acts caused any infringement ,\u201d it does not substantively argue that \u201ccausation\u201d is its \nown pleading requirement, distinct from \u201cintent to cause i nfringement.\u201d (D.I. 35 at 2) (emphasis \nadded). In its Opening Brief, Lenovo Beijing discusses causation as a prerequisite for proving (but presumably subsumed within) specific intent, but then pivots to argue for the first time in its Reply that causation is a standalone element of an inducement claim. (D.I. 35 at 8 -9; D.I. 37 at \n2).   \nI do not consider Lenovo Beijing\u2019s discussion of causation in its Opening Brief sufficient \nto put LiTL on notice that it intended to argue causation must be pled as an element of induced infringement. For that reason, I will allow and have considered the parties\u2019 additional briefing (D.I. 39 Ex. A, 40, 41) on this issue.  3 \n I. BACKGROUND \nLiTL alleges Defendants  infringe one or more claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,289,688 (\u201cthe \n\u2019688 patent\u201d), 8,624,844 (\u201cthe \u2019844 patent\u201d ), 10,289,154 (\u201cthe \u2019154 patent\u201d), 9,880,715 (\u201cthe \u2019715 \npatent\u201d), 8,612,888 (\u201cthe \u2019888 patent) , and 8,577,957 (\u201cthe \u2019957 patent\u201d) (collectively, \u201c the \nAsserted Patent s.\u201d). The Asserted Patents relate to portable computing devices. T he Asserted \nClaims of the  \u2019688, \u2019844, \u2019154, \u2019715, and \u2019888 patents  (\u201cthe Display Alteration patents\u201d)  relate to  \naltering a portable computer\u2019s display in response to changes in the  physical configuration of the \ndevice. The Asserted Claim of the \u2019957 patent (\u201cthe Remote Service patent\u201d) relates to a \n\u201cstreamlined\u201d computer device capable of operating complex, server -based progr ams in a \nsimplified manner by transforming \u201clocal access operations\u201d into \u201cremote access operations\u201d that \ncan be performed  remotely by various  \u201cremote services .\u201d \nA. Display Alteration Patents   \nThe Asserted Claims of the Display Alteration Patents are generally directed to portable \ncomputers configurable among multiple \u201c display modes,\u201d  where the display changes in response \nto the physical configuration of the device. (D.I. 31 Ex. A, B, C, D, E). In its FAC , LiTL expressly \nasserts that Defendants\u2019 Accused Products infringe Claim 19 of the \u2019688 patent, Claim 10 of the \u2019844 patent, Claim 11 of the \u2019154 patent, Claim 1 of the \u2019715 patent, and Claim 27 of the \u2019888 \npatent. (D.I. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 117, 162, 209, 246, 287).  \nThe specific Asserted Claims differ slightly in some respects.  Some claim a \u201ccustomized \nuser interface\u201d that displays content  (the \u2019715 patent) , some claim a \u201cportable computer\u201d with a \ndisplay component that displays content  (the \u2019688, \u2019154, and \u2019844 patents) , and one  claims a \n\u201csystem\u201d that includes a display component  (the \u2019888 patent) . Some explicitly claim a keyboard \nand condition certain display modes on the operability or inoperability of that keyboard. Some 4 \n explicitly claim an \u201corientation sensor\u201d that is used to detect the current physical configuration of \nthe computer so that the display may be adjusted accordingly. Regardless, I find that all the Asserted Claims are \u201csubstantially similar \u201d and directed to the same concept , automatically \naltering a display in response to a change in the physical configuration of the device , which \nDefendants contend is  abstract . Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, \nN.A., 776 F.3d 1341, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (finding the  district court did not err in limiting its \nSection 101 analysis to a single representative claim where all claims were \u201csubstantially similar and linked to the same abstract idea\u201d). Therefore, I will consider Claim 19 of the \u2019688 patent as representative of the Display Alteration Patents\u2019  Asserted Claims in my analysis.  Claim 19 recites: \nA portable computer comprising:  \n \na base unit comprising an integrated keyboard;  \n \na single display unit including a single display screen configured to display \ncontent;  \n \nan orientation sensor which detects a physical orientation of the single display unit relative to the base unit;  \n and a display orientation module which orients the content displayed on the single display screen responsive to the physical orienta tion detected by the \norientation sensor between at least a first content display orientation, the second content display orientation being 180 degrees relative to the first content display orientation;  \n \nwherein the display orientation module is further configured to detect a change between a laptop mode, an easel mode, and a frame mode based on the detected physical orientation of the single display unit relative to the base unit, and wherein the display orientation module is further configured to: \n \ntrigger a display inversion from one of the first and second content display orientations to the other of the first and second content display orientations responsive to the orientation sensor detecting the change between the laptop mode and the easel mode , trigger a \ndisplay inversion from one of the first and second content display orientations to the other of the first and second content display 5 \n orientations responsive to the orientation sensor detecting the \nchange between the easel mode and the frame mod e. \n \nB. Remote Service Patent  \nThe \u2019 957 Patent  is titled , \u201cSystem and M ethod for S treamlining User Interaction \nwith Electronic Content .\u201d (D.I.  31 Ex. F). LiTL alleges Defendants infringe \u201cone or more \nof the claims of the \u2019957 patent, including at least claim 19.\u201d  (D.I. 31 \u00b6 318). Claim 19 \nrecites a n invention that allows users to operate server -based programs from a streamlined \ncomputer device  by leveraging some number of remote services ( e.g., online remote \nstorage  services)  to perform \u201c local  access operations\u201d ( e.g., memory storage) requ ested  by \nthe server -based program , remotely. (D.I. 31 Ex. F).  \nSpecifically, Claim 19 recites a \u201cstreamline d computer device\u201d ( i.e., a processor \n\u201coperatively connected to \u201d memory ), through which a user can  interact with  a server -based \n(non- local) program using the device\u2019s simplified graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) . The \nstreamlined device is capable of receiving \u201cexecutable operations\u201d from the server -based \nprogram and presenting those to the user via the device\u2019s GUI.  Once the user has selected \nan \u201cexecutable operation\u201d to be performed, the streamlined device determines  whether the  \n\u201cexecutable operation\u201d constitute s a \u201clocal access operation.\u201d An example of a \u201clocal \naccess operation \u201d could be storing electronic content to local memory. Upon determination \nthat an \u201cexecutable operation\u201d is a \u201clocal access operation,\u201d the streamlined device \ntransforms  the \u201clocal access operation\u201d into a \u201cremote access operation\u201d by (1) identifying \nsome characteristic of the executable operation ( e.g., determining that the file type  to be \nsaved  is a PDF), (2) searching  for a n available \u201cremote service\u201d that can perform the \noperation, based on said characteristic of the operation (e.g., searching for a remote service, \nsuch a s Google Drive , that can store PDF files), and (3) retrieving the  user\u2019s  access 6 \n information for the corresponding remote service . Finally, the  server -based program is \ninformed of the  execution  of the remote access operation  just as it would be if the operation \nhad been executed locally .  \nThe invention recited in Claim 19 simplifies  the user\u2019s experience so that all the \nuser must  do is select \u201c executable operations \u201d via the device\u2019s simplified GUI, without \nhaving to worry  about how the operation will be executed ( i.e., whether the operation will \ntake place locally or remotely , and, if remotely, which service will be used to carry out the \noperation) . LiTL claims that this  method of relying on a  potential  plurality of remote \nservices to perform operations that would otherwise  be performed locally reduces and/or \neliminates the need for \u201cnon- volatile memory\u201d in the streamlined computer device, which , \nin turn, reduces the complexity and cost of the device.  (D.I. 31 Ex. F at 18:64- 67). \nClaims  1 and 19 are the only independent claims recited  by \u2019957 patent . Claim 1 \nrecites the same concept as claim 19, but in method form. The dependent claims  merely \noffer  potential examples  for concretizing the generic terms  and steps  that are broadly \ndescribed by Claims 1 and 19. For these reasons, and b ecause Claim 19 is the only claim \nof the \u2019957 patent expressly asserted  by LiTL in its FAC , I will consider  Claim 1 9 \nrepresentative of the \u2019957 patent.  Claim 19 recites: \nA streamline d computer device, the device comprising:  \n \nat least one processor operatively connected to a memory, the processor when executing is  configured to cause the device to:  \n \nreceive electronic content hosted by a server system;  \n \nrender electronic content to a user in a graphical user interface;  \n \nreceive selection through the graphical user interface, by the user, of at least one executable operation provided by the server system within the electronic content;  7 \n  \ndetermine that the at least one executable operation performs a local \naccess operation, and  \n transform the at least one executable operation into a remote access operation, wherein transforming includes:  \n \nidentifying at least one characteristic of the at least one executable operation;  \n accessing a profile to retrieve information on at least  one \navailable remote services (sic) responsive to the at least one \nidentified characteristics (sic) of the executable operation;  \n selecting an available remote service from the at least one available remote service;  \n retrieving the service access informat ion for the selected \nremote service;  \n \nwherein transforming is executed based on the at least one characteristic of the at least one executable operation and the service access information;  and \n \ntransmit the remote access operation to the server system  \n \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nthe Court must accept the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true.  See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 555\u201356 (2007).  Rule 8(a) requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  Id.  at 555.  The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, \nbut they must provide more than labels, conclusions, or a \u201cformulaic recitation\u201d of the claim elements .  Id. (\u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d).  Moreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The facial plausibility standard is satisfied 8 \n when the complaint\u2019s factual content \u201callows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable  for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Id. (\u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d (cleaned up )). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Patent Eligi ble Subject Matter  \nPatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is a threshold legal issue. Bilski v. Kappos , 561 U.S. \n593, 602 (2010) . Accordingly, the \u00a7 101 inquiry is properly raised at the pleading stage if it is \napparent from the face of the patent that the asserted claims are not directed to eligible subject matter. See Cleveland Clinic Found. v. True Health Diagnostics LLC , 859 F.3d 1352, 1360 (Fed. \nCir. 2017) . This is, however, appropriate \u201conly when there are no factual allegations that, taken as \ntrue, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.\u201d Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 2018).   \nSection 101 of the Patent Act defines patent -eligible subject matter. It provides , \u201cWhoever \ninvents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement ther eof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions \nand requirements of this title.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Supreme Court has recognized an implicit \nexception for three categories of subject matter not eligible for patentability \u2014laws of nature, \nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas.  Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , 573 U.S. 208, 215 \n(2014). The purpose of these carve -outs is to protect the \u201cbasic tools of scientific and technological \nwork.\u201d Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 71 (2012).  \u201c[A] process \nis not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm ,\u201d as \u201can \napplication of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well 9 \n be deserving of patent protection.\u201d Id.  at 1293\u201394 (internal quotation marks and emphasis \nomitted). In order \u201cto transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent -eligible application of \nsuch a law, one must do more than simply state the law of nature while adding the words \u2018apply \nit.\u2019\u201d Id.  at 72 (emphasis omitted).   \nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed the framework laid out in Mayo  \u201cfor distinguishing pa tents \nthat claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim patent -\neligible applications of those concepts.\u201d Alice , 573 U.S. at 217. First, the court must determine \nwhether the claims are drawn to a patent -ineligible concept. Id. If the answer is yes, the court must \nlook to \u201cthe elements of the claim both individually and as an \u2018ordered combination\u2019\u201d to see if there is an \u201c\u2018inventive concept\u2019 \u2014i.e. , an element or combination of elements that is \u2018sufficient to \nensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.\u2019\u201d Id.  (alteration in original). \u201cA claim that recites an abstract idea must include \n\u2018additional features\u2019 to ensure that the [claim] is more than a draftin g effort designed to monopolize \nthe [abstract idea].\u201d Id.  at 221. Further, \u201cthe prohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be \ncircumvented by attempting to limit the use of [the idea] to a particular technological environment.\u201d Id. at 222 (quoting Bilski, 561 U.S. at 610-11). Thus, \u201cthe mere recitation of a \ngeneric computer cannot transform a patent -ineligible abstract idea into a patent -eligible \ninvention.\u201d Id.   \n \u201cPatent eligibility under \u00a7 101 is a question of law that may contain underlying issues of \nfact.\u201d Solutran, Inc. v. Elavon, Inc., 931 F.3d 1161, 1165 (Fed. Cir. 2019) . Whether a claim is \ndrawn to patent -eligible subject matter \u201cis a matter of both claim construction and statutory \nconstruction.\u201d In re Bilski , 545 F.3d 943, 951 (Fed. Cir. 2008), aff\u2019d sub nom. Bilski v. Kappos , \n561 U.S. 593 (2010). Claim construction is a question of law. See Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. 10 \n Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 325 (2015) (citing Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. \n370, 388- 91 (1996)).  \n1. Display Alteration Patents  \nThe Display Alteration Patents recite a portable computer de vice that can be configured in \nmultiple \u201cdisplay modes\u201d and alters the orientation of its display according to its physical configuration. Defendants argue the claimed invention is merely \u201caltering a display in response to information\u201d and is therefore abs tract. (D.I. 11 at 8). I disagree. The Display Alteration Patents \ndisclose a non- abstract technical improvement for enabling the use of a portable computing device \nin multiple physical configurations.  \nIn analyzing Section 101 questions involving computer -related inventions, the Federal \nCircuit makes the critical distinction \u201cbetween, on one hand, computer -functionality \nimprovements and, on the other, uses of existing computers as tools in aid of processes focused on \u2018abstract ideas.\u2019\u201d Elec. Power Grp., Inc . v. Alstom S.A., 830 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \nDefendants  cite several Federal Circuit decisions finding claims directed to \u201caltering a display in \nresponse to information\u201d to be abstract. (D.I. 11 at 8). These examples address patents claiming various ways of selecting and organizing content to be displayed on a static display screen. E.g., \nInterval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc., 896 F.3d 1335, 1344- 45 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding abstract \nthe \u201ccollection, organization, and display of two sets of informa tion on a generic display device\u201d); \nAmeranth, Inc. v. Domino\u2019s Pizza, LLC , 792 F. App'x 780, 787 ( Fed. Cir. 2019) (same for \n\u201cautomatic formatting for different handheld devices\u201d); Elec. Power , 830 F.3d at 1354 (same for \n\u201cgathering and analyzing information of a specific content, then displaying the results\u201d). The \n\u201cfocus\u201d of these claims is the selection and presentation of information, an abstract idea.  11 \n By contrast, here, the \u201cfocus\u201d of the Display Alteration Patents is allowing a portable \ncomputer device to be operated in multiple physical configurations or \u201cdisplay modes.\u201d The \nautomatic alteration of the display is intended to ensure continuity of operability regardless of the physical configuration of the device. The focus of the claims is not what is on the display screen, \nbut rather ensuring that the display screen remains functional for the user in each physical configuration of the device. This is a specific, technical improvement in the field of portable computing devices. It is not an abstract idea.  \nDefendants also argue, \u201c[T]he idea of altering a display based on a detected configuration \nabout the device was well -known in the art,\u201d and a concept being \u201cwell understood in the art\u201d \nsupports a finding of abstractness. (D.I. 11 at 9, (citing Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Techtronic \nIndustries Co., 935 F.3d 1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2019))). They point to an IBM patent from 1996 that discloses an \u201capparatus for altering a display . . . in response to a change in orientation.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 9). Exactly how much the  Display Alteration Patents differ from what was disclosed in the \nprior art is a matter to be resolved at a later time.  Defendants imply the invention is obvious, but that is not an issue at this stage.  For now, I find that LiTL has pled sufficient facts  for me to \nconclude that the Display Alteration Patents are directed to \u201ca specific means or method that improves the relevant technology.\u201d Chamberlain., 935 F.3d at 1347. While the general concept of altering a display in response to the orientation of a laptop computer in its standard laptop configuration may have been known, the Display Alteration Patents are directed to altering the display of a device transitioning among multiple physical configurations ( i.e., \u201claptop mode,\u201d \n\u201cframe mode,\u201d and \u201ceasel mode\u201d). I agree with LiTL that this is a specific technological improvement in the portable computing field. 12 \n Because I do not find the Display Alteration Patents are directed toward an abstract idea, \nDefendants\u2019 Section 101 motion to dismiss the Display Alteration Patents is DENIED.  \n2. Remote Service Patent  \nDefendants argue that the \u2019957 patent is directed to \u201caccessing remotely stored \ninformation,\u201d which the Federal Circuit has held is an abstract idea. (D.I. 11 a t 4, (citing \nIntellectual Ventures I LLC v. Erie Indem. Co., 850 F.3d 1315, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (\u201cWe conclude therefore that the [asserted patent\u2019s] concept of remotely accessing user -specific \ninformation is abstract, and thus fails under step one.\u201d))). I disagree that Claim 19 of the \u2019957 \npatent is merely directed to accessing remotely stored information.  \nDefendants are correct that to assess whether a claim is directed to an abstract idea, \u201cit is \nnecessary to analyze the \u2018focus\u2019 of the claim, i.e. , its \u2018character as a whole.\u2019\u201d (D.I. 11 at 4, citing \nSAP Am., Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC , 898 F.3d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2018)). Here, the \u201cfocus\u201d of Claim \n19 is not \u201caccessing remotely stored information,\u201d but rather delegating \u201clocal access operations\u201d \nto remote services to be performed remotely. Put simply, the Claim is directed to outsourcing tasks, rather than accessing information. Because the Claim is directed to a specific method of finding, accessing, and delegating tasks to remote services, I find it is not directed to an abstract idea.  \nI agree with LiTL that Claim 19 recites \u201ca non -abstract computer -functiona lity \nimprovement \u2026 done by a specific technique that departs from earlier approaches.\u201d (D.I. 16 at 18 (citing Ancora Techs., Inc. v. HTC Am., Inc., 908 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2018))). Claim 19 \nimproves computer functionality in two specific ways. First , it allows users to operate complex, \nserver -based programs from a simplified GUI, thereby reducing user confusion by not requiring \nusers to be familiar with complex features they neither need nor understand. (D.I. 31 Ex. F at 12:18- 45). Second, by enlisti ng remote services to perform operations that would otherwise be 13 \n performed locally, the invention eliminates or reduces the need for local non- volatile memory, \nallowing for cheaper, less complex, more \u201cstreamlined\u201d computer devices. (D.I. 31 Ex. F at 18:64-\n67).  \nFinally, Claim 19 does more than simply claim all methods of \u201ctransforming a local access \noperation into a remote access operation.\u201d The Claim specifically recites a technique for such transformation, including (1) characterizing the type of local a ccess operation, (2) cross -\nreferencing that specific type of local access operation against a potential plurality of remote services to find one that is available and capable of performing the operation, and (3) accessing the remote service by retrieving t he user\u2019s or the device\u2019s specific access information for that \nremote service. Because Claim 19 describes a specific technological improvement in the field of portable computing and recites a specific technique for implementation, I find that it is not dir ected \nto an abstract idea.  Therefore, Defendants\u2019 Section 101 motion to dismiss the Remote Service Patent is DENIED.  \nB. Induced Infringement  \nTo succeed on a  claim  of induced infringement, \u201cthe patentee must show, first , that there \nhas been direct infringement, and second, that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific intent to encourage another\u2019s infringement. While proof of intent is necessary, direct evidence is not required; rather, circumstantial evidence may suffice.\u201d  \nMEMC Elect r. Materials, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp., 420 F.3d 1369, 1378 (Fed. \nCir. 2005)  (cleaned up) . \u201c[L]iability for inducing infringement attaches only if the defendant knew \nof the patent and that \u2018 the induced acts constitute patent infringement.\u2019\u201d Commil USA, LLC v. \nCisco Systems, Inc. , 575 U.S. 632, 639 (2015). \u201c[A] plaintiff must prove that the defendants\u2019 \nactions induced infringing acts and that they knew or should have known their actions would 14 \n induce actual infringement .\u201d Warner -Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp., 316 F.3d 1348, 1363 (Fed. Cir. \n2003) (cleaned up).  \nIn summary , to prove  induced infringement , a plaintiff must prove the following elements: \n(1) direct infringement, (2) knowing inducement of  infringement, and (3) specific intent to \nencourage another\u2019s infringement . To  prove the second element,  \u201cknowing inducement of \ninfringement,\u201d  it logically follows that a plaintiff must prove the following sub- elements: (a) \nknowledge of the patent (s), Commil , 575 U.S. at 639;  (b) knowledge of the direct infringement  of \nthe patent (s), id.; (c) action (s) taken to induce infringement, Warner -Lambert , 316 F.3d at 1363; \n(d) knowledge the action (s) would induce the direct infringement, Id. ; and (e) some  causal link \nbetween the inducing acts and the direct infringement. Dynacore Holdings Corp. v. U.S. Philips \nCorp., 363 F.3d 1263, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2004)  (\u201c[t]o prevail under a theory of indirect infringemen t, \n[plaintiff] must first prove that the defendants\u2019 actions led to direct infringement\u201d) .  This means \nthat at  the pleading stage, a plaintiff must allege facts that would allow a factfinder plausibly to \nconclude each of these elements and sub -elements is satisfied. LiTL has done that here.  \nLiTL alleges, \u201cLenovo Beijing knowingly intended to induce several direct infringers \u2013 \nspecifically Lenovo U .S., end users, repair and service technicians, Lenovo U .S. employees and \ncontracto rs \u2013 to infringe the Asserted Patents.\u201d (D.I. 36 at 2; D.I. 31 \u00b6 \u00b6 144 , 193, 231, 270, 308, \n339).  Lenovo Beijing does not dispute that LiTL has successfully pled the requisite direct \ninfringement element . It does, however,  argue that LiTL has failed to successfully plead (1) pre -\nsuit knowledge of the Asserted Patents , (2) specific intent to cause infringement , and, belatedly, \n(3) a causal link between the inducing acts and the direct infringement . (D.I. 35 at 5 ; D.I. 37 at 2).  \nAs I recentl y stated , when induced infringement is alleged, an amended complaint  can \noperate to plead knowledge since the filing of the original complaint. Wrinkl, Inc. v. Facebook, 15 \n Inc., 2021 WL 4477022 , at *7 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021). Here, LiTL\u2019s FAC  alleges  post-suit \nknowledge as to all six of the Asserted Patents , i.e., knowledge  since  the original complaint was \nfiled on May 22, 2020. (D.I. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 140, 189, 227, 266, 304, 335).  \nFor its claim of  pre-suit induced infringement , LiTL must allege sufficient facts to support  \nan inference that  Lenovo Beijing had knowledge of each of the Asserted Patents  prior to the \ncommencement of this suit. For the reasons that follow, I find that  LiTL has succeeded in doing \nso only for the \u2019688 patent. Therefore,  I will GRANT  Lenovo Beijing\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for \nfailure to state a claim of pre -suit induced infringement for the \u2019844, \u2019715, \u2019957, \u2019 154, and \u2019888 \npatents.  \n1. Pre-Suit Knowledge  \na. \u2018688 Patent  \nLiTL has alleged sufficient facts to support a plausible inference that Lenovo Beijing had \npre-suit knowledge of the \u2019688 patent.  \nThe \u2019688 patent is cited on the face of one of Lenovo Beijing\u2019s patents  and Lenovo Beijing \nidentified the \u2019688 patent specifically  in two Information Disclosure Statements it submitted to the \nUSPTO in connection with two of its patent applications . (D.I. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 33, 131- 32).  \nUSPTO examiners cited the published version of the patent application that issued as the \n\u2019688 patent (\u201cthe \u2019832 publication\u201d) in its rejection of  two pending Lenovo Beijing patent \napplications . Lenovo Beijing itself discussed the substance of the \u2019832 publication during \nprosecution of another of its patent applications. (D.I. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 128- 29). I agree with Lenovo Beijing \nthat, without additional context , a reference to a patent application, even a p ublished one, is often \nirrelevant to knowledge of a patent, as a \u201csubstantial percentage of applications never result in \npatents ,\u201d and \u201c[ w]hat the scope of  claims in patents that do issue will be is something totally 16 \n unforeseeable.\u201d State Indus., Inc. v. A .O. Smith Corp., 751 F.2d 1226, 1236 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Here, \nhowever, LiTL has also alleged facts showing Lenovo Beijing was familiar with the actual \nsubstance described in the \u2019832 publication and has pointed to specific instances in which Lenovo \nBeijing cited the patent the \u2019832 publication issued as. This additional context makes it more \nplausible that  Lenovo Beijing was aware a patent did eventually issue for the invention described \nin the \u2019832 publication, which makes Lenovo Beijing\u2019s awareness of the \u2019832 publication more \nrelevant to knowledge.  \nLenovo Group Ltd, the parent company of Lenovo Beijing, has cited to the \u2019688 patent six \ntimes and to the \u2019832 publication three times , and LiTL points to over one hundred citations to the \n\u2019688 patent by other \u201cmajor players\u201d in the personal computing industry to show  the \u2019688 patent \nis \u201cwell known\u201d in the industry. (D.I. 31 \u00b687) .  The allegations adequately support the conclusion. \nSee Investpic, LLC v. FactSet Research Sys., Inc. , 2011 WL 4591078, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 30, \n2011) (finding an asserted patent was \u201cwell -known in the industry having been cited by at least 79 \nissued U.S. patents \u201d in the last decade).  While none of these allegations on its own may be  \nsufficient to demonstrate knowledge, taken together, I find that they plausibly support an inference \nthat Lenovo Beijing had pre -suit knowledge of the \u2019688 patent .  \nb. \u2019844 Patent , \u2019715 Patent, \u2019957 Patent, \u2019 154 Patent, \u2019888 Patent  \nLiTL does not allege a single instance of Lenovo Beijing specifically referencing any of \nthe remaining five Asserted Patents . Instead, it relies on a small handful of citations to various \napplications that eventually issued as  the A sserted Patents or, even more distantly, applications \nthat eventually issued as  patents related to the Asserted Patents, sometimes once or twice removed.  \n(E.g., D.I. 31 \u00b6\u00b6  171, 173- 74, 259, 329). For the \u2019154 and \u2019888 patent s, LiTL does not  identify any 17 \n instances of Lenovo Beijing citing either  the patents or their corresponding applications . (D.I. 31 \n\u00b6\u00b6 218- 236; 256- 277).  \nBecause LiTL  cannot point to any facts suggesting Lenovo Beijing had specific knowledge \nof the remaining Asserted Patent s, it relies  on general allegations of  (1) Lenovo Beijing\u2019s \n\u201csophistication and extensive experience with IP matters and substantial prosecution act ivities \ndirected to electronic devices with 2 -in-1 functionality,\u201d  (2) the Asserted Patents\u2019 relationship  to \nthe \u2019688 patent , and (3) the Asserted Patents\u2019  membership in  \u201ca patent family that has been \nfrequently cited in patent applications of major player s in the personal computing space,\u201d  to \nsupport its allegation of pre -suit knowledge. ( See, e.g., D.I. 31 \u00b6  219, 330). I do not consider these \nallegations  specific enough to plausibly support a conclusion that Lenovo Beijing had pre -suit \nknowledge of the \u2019844, \u2019715, \u2019957, \u2019154, and  \u2019888 patents. \n2. Specific Intent  and Causation  \nIn this case, because Lenovo U .S. continues to offer the Accused Products for sale in the \nUnited States , the specific intent and causation analysis for induced infringement is essentially the \nsame for the  pre-suit claims of the \u2018688 patent and post -suit claims  of all the Asserted Patents .  \nLiTL alleges the Accused Products directly infringe as soon as they are sold in the United \nStates  by Lenovo U .S.. Lenovo Beijing does not dispute  this theory of direct infringement, and \neven attempts to use  it to argue that, because no further action is requir ed to \u201ccause\u201d infringement, \nLenovo Beijing cannot have induced infringement. I find that argument  unconvincing.  \nIf the Accused Products directly infringe upon being sold in the U .S., it follows that any \nactions by Lenovo Beijing intended to make the products available for sale in the U .S. would, by \ndefinition, be relevant to the argument that Lenovo Beijing intended to cause infringement. Here, 18 \n LiTL has alleged several actions undertaken by Lenovo Beijing that evince a specific intent to \ncause the Accused Products to be sold in the United States .  \nLenovo Beijing specifically developed and designed one or more of the Accused Products  \nto comply with U.S. F CC requirements and to meet U.S. EPA Energy Star requirements. (D.I. 31 \n\u00b6 22). A Lenovo Beijing employee submitted an \u201cequipment authorization application\u201d for one of \nthe Accused Products to the FCC and explicitly noted that public disclosure of documents containing proprietary information about the Accused Product s would give competi tors an unfair \nadvantage in \u201cthe market ,\u201d presumably referring to the U.S. market. (D.I. 31 \u00b6 25).   \nThe Federal Circuit has held that evidence of design decisions undertaken for the purpose \nof enabling infringing use is evidence of specific intent to induc e infringement. See Lucent Techs., \nInc. v. Gateway, Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Ricoh Co. v. Quanta Computer Inc., 550 F.3d 1325, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2008). T he Federal Circuit has specifically pointed to evidence of \nforeign companies designing products \u201cto meet certain United States Energy standards, including \nEnergy Star\u201d as evidence that supports a finding  that a defendant \u201cactually induced third- party \ndirect infringement.\u201d  Power Integrations, Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int\u2019l, Inc ., 843 F.3d \n1315, 1333- 34 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The same evidence that supports a finding of inducement may \nalso support a finding of an intent to induce infringement.  I agree with LiTL that here, because \nthe \u201cinfringing use\u201d  is the Accused Products  being sold in the U nited States , evidence of  design \ndecisions undertaken for the purpose of enabling that infringing use  (i.e., enabling the sale  of the \nproducts in the U.S. by designing them to comply with U.S. regulatory requirements ), is evidence \nthat plausibly supports a finding of both affirmative acts and specific intent to induce infringement.  \nLenovo Beijing is the registrant of the Lenovo.c om domain and, as registrant , LiTL claims, \n\u201cis solely responsible  for what website the Lenovo.com Domain points to in various locations 19 \n around the world.\u201d2 (D.I. 31 \u00b6\u00b610, 16). Lenovo Beijing uses the Lenovo.com Domain to \ndisseminate product  manuals ,3 press releases,  and other advertising material  about the Accused \nProducts to potential Lenovo customers in the United States. (D.I. 31 \u00b6144, 145). Specific actions \nsuch as this, ta ken by Lenovo Beijing to encourage  customers to purchase infringing products in \nthe United States , also support an inference of intent to induce infringement.  \nIn my view, Plaintiff \u2019s factual assertions, taken together and viewed in the light most \nfavorabl e to LiTL, plausibly support an inference that Lenovo Beijing intends to cause the Accused \nProducts to be sold in the United States .4  \nLenovo Beijing argues LiTL  pleads these factual allegations to show specific intent but \npleads nothing to show causation between Lenovo Beijing\u2019s inducing actions and the direct \ninfringement .5 (D.I. 37 at 1 (\u201cBut even if these activities are the inducing acts, they are insufficient \n \n2  While Lenovo Beijing disputes the veracity of that claim (D.I. 35 at 7- 8), at the motion to \ndismiss sta ge I must treat the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true.  \n \n3  Lenovo Beijing\u2019s argument that other third- party websites also post user guides for the \nAccused Products, even if properly considered on a motion to dismiss, would not be compelling. \n(D.I. 3 5 at 7). Lenovo Beijing has a commercial interest in customers purchasing the Accused \nProducts and it is reasonable to infer the information it posts relating to those products is meant to encourage and facilitate those purchases.  What third -party website s do is irrelevant to Lenovo \nBeijing\u2019s intent.  \n \n4  Lenovo Beijing owns United States trademark registrations that it \u201cuses in connection with \nsales and offers for sale of the Accused Products within the United States.\u201d (D.I. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 36- 56). \nLenovo Beijing ac ted affirmatively to obtain these trademark registrations and use them in \nconnection with the Accused Products. Given the other allegations, I do not have to decide whether these actions are additional evidence of an intent to secure the Accused Products\u2019 competitiveness in the United States market and ultimately to facilitate the sale of the Accused Products in the U.S.  \n \n5  Technically, Lenovo Beijing argues this in the alternative. I am unconvinced by Lenovo \nBeijing\u2019s primary argument, that because LiTL\u2019s allegations directed to intent are in the \u201cJurisdiction and Venue\u201d section of the FAC and only incorporated by reference in its counts of induced infringement, Lenovo Beijing was not \u201con notice that such activities were directed to inducement.\u201d (D.I. 37 at 1). In addition to incorporating the \u201cJurisdiction and Venue\u201d paragraphs by reference, LiTl re -alleges enough other similar factual allegations in its induced infringement 20 \n because they are not alleged to cause infringement.\u201d)). I disagree. The same factual allegations \nthat support a plausible inference of intent also support a plausible inference of causation. The causal nexus between the inducing actions and direct infringement can be shown through circumstantial evidence.  \u201cIndeed, we have affirmed induced infringement verdicts based on \ncircumstantial evidence of inducement ( e.g., advertisements, user manuals) directed to a class of \ndirect infringers (e.g., customers, end users) without requiring hard proof that any individual third-party direct infringer was actually persuaded to infringe by that material.\u201d  Power Integrations , 843 \nF.3d at  1335.  \nHere, because the Accused Products directly infringe when sold and the inducing acts LiTL \nalleges are directed toward encouraging U.S. customers to purchase the Accused Products , LiTL \nneed not allege \u201chard proof\u201d that any individual purchaser \u201cwas  actually  persu aded \u201d to purchase \nthe Accused Products by Lenovo Beijing\u2019s inducing acts. The factual allegations LiTL has made provide  sufficient circumstantial evidence to draw such an inferenc e at the pleadings stage.  \nFinally, Lenovo Beijing\u2019s damages argument, \u201cit is unclear what kind of relief LiTL can \neven obtain against Lenovo Beijing,\u201d  (D.I. 35 at 9) is both premature and irrelevant to the issue of \nwhether LiTL has successfully stated a claim of induced infringement.  \nLiTL has plausibly alleged pre -suit knowledge , causation, and specific intent to induce \ninfringement of the \u2019688 patent. Thus, Lenovo Beijing\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim of pre -suit induced infringement is DENIED as to the \u2019688 patent. LiTL has successfully  \nalleged  post-suit knowledge , causation, and specific intent to induce infringement as to all six of \n \ncounts t o put Lenovo Beijing on notice of its theory of induced infringement. ( See, e.g., D.I. 31 \n\u00b6\u00b6 141, 143, 147).  \n 21 \n the Asserted Patents. Therefore, Lenovo Beijing\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim of \npost-suit induced infringement is DENIED as to all patents.  \nC. Willful Infringement  \n\u201c[A] finding of induced infringement does not compel a finding of willfulness. Indeed, t he \nstandard  required  for willful infringement is different than that for induced infringement .\u201d  SRI \nInt\u2019l, Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc., 14 F.4th 1323, 1329 (Fed Cir. 2021).  \u201cUnder Halo , the concept \nof \u2018willfulness\u2019 requires \u2026 no more than deliberate or intentional infringeme nt. The question of \nenhanced damages is addressed by the court once an affirmative finding of willfulness has been made.\u201d Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters., Inc., 946 F.3d 1367, 1378 (Fed. Cir. \n2020) (citing Halo Elec s., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc. , 579 U.S. 93, 105 (2016))  (cleaned up) . \nAs I stated  recently in Wrinkl , an amended complaint cannot rely upon the original \ncomplaint as a basis to allege knowledge for a willful infringement claim. Wrinkl, Inc. v. Facebook, \nInc., 2021 WL 4477022, at *7 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021).  \nLiTL has plausibly alleged that Lenovo Beijing had pre -suit knowledge of the existence of \nthe \u2019688 patent. A t the motion to dismiss stage, that  is sufficient to support a claim of willful \ninfringement. Thus, as to the \u2019688 patent, Lenovo Beijing\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim of willful infringement is DENIED.  Because LiTL has failed to plausibly allege pre- suit \nknowledge as to the remaining Asserted Pat ents, I will GRANT Lenovo Beijing\u2019s m otion to \ndismiss for failure to state a claim of willful infringement as to the other five  patents.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Defendants\u2019 Section 101 m otion to dismiss is DENIED with \nrespect  to all six Asserted Patents . 22 \n Lenovo Beijing\u2019s m otion to dismiss for failure to state a claim of post- suit induced \ninfringement is DENIED with respect  to all six Asserted P atents. Lenovo Beijing\u2019s m otion to \ndismiss for failure to state a claim of pre -suit induced infringement is GRANTED with respect  to \nthe \u2019844, \u2019154, \u2019715, \u2019957, and \u2019888 patents and DENIED with respect  to the \u2019688 patent. Lenovo \nBeijing\u2019s m otion to dismiss for failure to state a claim of willful infringement is  GRANTED with \nrespect  to the \u2019844, \u2019154, \u2019715, \u2019957, and \u2019888 patents and DENIED with respect  to the \u2019688 patent. \nAn appropriate order will issue.
