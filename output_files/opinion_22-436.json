(\u201c Shopify Holdings\u201d)  and Shopify (USA) Inc .\u2019s (\u201c Shopify USA,\u201d \nand collectively, \u201cShopify\u201d) motion to stay this action in its entirety  (the \u201cMotion\u201d)  pending \ncompletion of Baton v. Ledger  SAS, Case No. 21 -cv-2470- EMC  (N.D. Cal.)  (\u201cBaton\u201d) \u2014a class \naction litigation cu rrently pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia  (the \u201cNorthern District\u201d) .  (D.I. 10)  Plaintiff s Gregory Forsberg, Christopher Gunter, \nSamuel Kissinger and Scott Sipprell  (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) , who are acting individually and on behalf of a \nproposed class, oppose the Motion.  The Court has reviewed the relev ant briefing, (D.I. 11; D.I. \n13; D.I. 16; D.I. 46), and it heard argument during a teleconference with the parties held on \nAugust 15, 2022 (the \u201cAugust 15 argument\u201d) .  For the reasons that follow, the Court hereby \nORDERS that the Motion is DENIED  without prejudice to renew .  \nIn Baton, the five individual plaintiffs brought suit against defendants Ledger SAS, \nShopify, Inc. and Shopify USA.  ( Baton, D.I. 33)  The allegations in Baton were similar to those 2 \n at issue here in a number of ways, including that :  (1) both cases relate to a 2020 data breach \nimpacting Ledger SAS cryptocurrency hardware wallets  (which, in turn, were sold via a website \noperating on Shopify, Inc.\u2019s platform); and (2) in both cases, the  defendants are alleged to have \nfailed to take various action s that would have protected the plaintiffs\u2019 personal identifying \ninformation .  (See D.I. 1; D.I. 44; Baton, D.I. 33)   There are some differences between the cases \ntoo, including that :  (1) t he respective sets of defendants do not entirely overlap; and ( 2) the \nasserted causes of action in the respective operative complaints differ in some ways.   (D.I. 44; \nBaton, D.I. 33)   \nIn November 2021, the Baton Court dismissed the operative complaint  in that case \nagainst all defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction.  In doing so, the Baton Court held (as to \nthe two d efendants in that case that are also involved in this matter ) that:  (1) it lacked general \njurisdiction in California regarding Shopify USA; (2) it lacked specific jurisdiction over Shopify, Inc. and Shopify USA ; and (3) no jurisdictional discovery would be permitted .  See Baton v. \nLedger SAS, Case No. 21 -cv-02470- EMC , 2021 WL 5226315, at * 4-7, *13- 14 (N.D. Cal. Nov. \n9, 2021) ; see also  (D.I. 13 at 6- 7 n.3) .  On December 13, 2021, the Baton plaintiffs filed a notice \nof appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; the Ninth Circuit is considering holding argument on that appe al sometime during November 14- 18, 2022.  (D.I. 11 \nat 4; D.I. 46)   Plaintiffs filed the instant suit in this case on April 1, 2022, a few months after the \nappellate process in Baton  began .  (D.I. 1)  \nIn its briefing  on the Motion, Shopify argues that the Court should stay this case pending \nthe Baton appeal in light of the applicability of the \u201cfirst- filed\u201d rule, or, failing that, pursuant to \nthe three discretionary factors that our Court typically uses to assess a motion to stay.  (D.I. 11 at 5-12)  For the following reasons, the Court disagrees  that a stay is warranted now .   3 \n With regard to the first -filed rule, normally if two cases are so similar as to implicate th at \nrule, then principles of comity and efficient judicial adminis tration suggest that the second- filed \ncase should be stayed in  favor of the first  (or transferred to the first -filed court).   See E.E.O.C. v. \nUniv. of Pa., 850 F.2d 969, 971 (3d Cir. 1988).  But even assuming that the \u201cfirst -filed\u201d rule \napplies here,1 in the Court\u2019s view , this is one of those \u201crare . . . circumstances\u201d where a stay of \nthe second case is not appropriate (at least, not now).  See id. at 972; cf. Swetra v. DirecTV, LLC , \nCivil N o. 15- 8761 (RBK/AMD), 2016 WL 4208440, at *6 & n.3 (D.N.J. Aug. 9, 2016) \n(concluding that even if the first -filed rule applied, the case would be one of those \u201c rare\u201d  cases \nwhere an exception to the rule was warranted, in part because the first -filed case was currently \nstayed pending review of an order in an appellate court, and because it would be unfair to the \nplaintiff to have the second- filed case stayed in favor of a first -filed case that was awaiting  a \ndecision from an appellate court).  \nHere, the procedural circumstances are unusual enough that the intention behind the first -\nfiled rule does not really support a stay, at least at this time .  (D.I. 52 (hereafter, \u201cTr.\u201d) at 24 -25, \n59)  The current status  quo in the Baton litigation is that the case has been dismissed in the \nNorthern District on personal jurisdiction grounds.  More than that, the reasons why the Baton Court found no personal jurisdiction as to Shopify, Inc. and Shopify USA will not be dispositive \nin this case.  As to Shopify USA, that is because it is a Delaware corporation, and so general personal jurisdiction as to it (as well as to fellow Delaware corporations Shopify Holdings and \n \n1  Plaintiffs argue that the rule does not  apply; they suggest that this is so because \nthere are too many differences between the claims /parties/facts  at issue in  Baton and those at \nissue in this matter.  ( D.I. 13 at 5- 6)  That issue is not free from doubt.  But the  Court need not \ndefinitively address it now .  That is because even if the Court assumes arguendo that the rule \napplies, as is set out further below, the Court still would not conclude that the Motion is well \ntaken at this time.  4 \n additional Defendant TaskUs, Inc. (\u201cTaskUs\u201d) ) will be a given here.  (D.I. 44 at  \u00b6 36)  And as to \nShopify, Inc., here Plaintiffs have stated their view that the key issue regarding personal \njurisdiction will be one of general jurisdiction \u2014i.e., an assert ion that there is general personal \njurisdiction as to Shopify, Inc. either because it is the alter ego of the other two Defendant Shopify entities, or because those other two entities act as its agent.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 38 -41; see also  \nD.I. 13 at 6 & n.3; Tr. at 41- 42, 44)  The Baton Court did not address an alter ego or agency \nrationale for personal jurisdiction in deciding that the  case should be dismissed.  Baton, 2021 \nWL 5226315, at *5 n.1 (noting that the court did not need to address whether the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that jurisdict ional contacts may be imputed between Shopify, Inc. and \nShopify USA , in light of the nature of the court\u2019s decision).   \nSo what this all means is that if the Court stayed this case, and the Ninth Circuit did \nnothing more than affirm the Baton Court\u2019s decis ion as to Shopify, Inc. and Shopify USA on the \nvery grounds that the Baton Court relied upon for dismissal, then our Court and the parties here \nwould in no way benefit from the stay.  In other words, in that scenario, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision would have no impact on this case as to Defendants Shopify USA, Shopify Holdings or TaskUs , since there is clearly personal jurisdiction as to those Defendants in Delaware.  And that \ndecision would have no meaningful impact on this  case as to Defendant Sho pify, Inc., since here, \nPlaintiffs would still be arguing that there is general jurisdiction over that Defendant pursuant to alter ego/agency rationales \u2014rationale s that the Ninth Circuit would never  have addressed.\n2   \n \n2   Shopify argues that even though it was not the basis for the Baton Court\u2019s \ndecision as to lack of personal jurisdiction, the Ninth Circuit might still address the argument that \nShopify, Inc. is the alter ego of Shopify USA ; it asserts that in light of this, a stay is warranted so \nthat this Court can get the benefit of th e Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis on that alter ego issue, which \nthis Court could then utilize in assessing a later personal jurisdiction challenge in this case.  ( D.I. \n11 at 10; D.I. 16 at 4; Tr. at 8 -9)  Shopify makes this assertion because in th eir briefing in the  \nBaton appeal, the Baton plaintiffs argue d that specific jurisdiction as to Shopify, Inc. could lie 5 \n Of course, it is possible that there could be other outcomes in t he Ninth Circuit.  The  \nNinth Circuit might, for example, overturn the Baton  Court\u2019s decision and send the case back to \nthe Northern District so that it c an proceed forward  on the merits as to Shopify, Inc. and Shopify \nUSA.  But  if that occurred, then Shopify could always renew its motion for a stay in this case.3  \nMoreover, although it is possible that a reversal could happen, it is notable that none of the \nparties to this Motion \u2014i.e., neither Shopify nor Plaintiffs \u2014believe that the Ninth Circuit should \nreverse the Baton Court .  In most cases where a party is seeking a stay in this Court, the movant \nis suggesting that if things play out in the other jurisdiction like it  thinks they will, then there will \nbe significant efficiencies gained from staying the case.  But here, Shopify obviously believes (as \nits counsel confirmed during the August 15 argument) that the Baton Court\u2019s decision was the \ncorrect decision, and that i t should be affirmed on appeal.  (Tr. at 8); c f. Swetra , 2016 WL \n \ndue to the fact that it is the alter ego of Shopify USA.  ( See Baton v. Ledger SAS, Appeal No. 21-\n17036, D.I. 10 at 44 (9th Cir . Apr. 18, 2022) ) \n \nAs an initial matter, if a stay here is  not granted, but th e Ninth Circuit did end up \naddressing this alter ego issue, that does not necessarily mean that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision \nwould be of no benefit to this Court.  It could be that the District Judge who is eventually \nassigned to this case will not have the ability to address a personal jurisdiction challenge until \nafter the Ninth Circuit issues its opinion.   (See D.I. 16 at 9 (Shopify indicating that the median \ntime from notice of appeal to decision in the Ninth Circuit is \u201cjust 12.9 months \u201d) (cit ation \nomitted) ; D.I. 46)  But more significantly, in the Baton case, Shopify is arguing that the Baton \nplaintiffs have forfeited their alter ego argument regarding Shopify, Inc. on appeal , because the \nBaton plaintiffs  did not sufficiently advance that argument at the district court level.  ( See Baton \nv. Ledger SAS, Appeal No. 21- 17036, D.I. 29 at 26- 27 (9th Cir. July 18, 2022) ; Tr. at 13, 19- 22, \n61)  If Shopify is right on this  front, then the  Ninth Circuit will never take up the merits of the \nalter ego issue at all . \n \n3  It is true that there will be some work that needs to be done in this case between \nnow and the date that the Ninth Circuit issues its ruling.  But e ven if the Ninth Circuit overturns  \nthe Baton Court\u2019s decision, and even if this Court w ere then confronted with a renewed motion \nto stay premised on the first -filed rule, the amount of Court and party work that occurs in the \ninterval here will not likely be o utsized.  That  is particularly so because this case is still in its \nearly stages, and bec ause (as Shopify points out ) the Baton appeal appears to be moving along a  \nrelatively  speedy track.  (D.I. 16 at 9; D.I. 46)  6 \n 4208440, at *5- 6 (concluding that a defendant\u2019s motion to stay, premised on the application of \nthe first -filed rule, should be denied, in part because in the first -filed case the defendant was \ntaking a position that, if ultimately adopted by the first -filed court, would m ean that there was \nnot overlap between the first -filed and second -filed cases ).  During the August 15 argument, \nPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel confirmed that the ir analysis is the same .  (See D.I. 13 at 10- 11; Tr. at 43- 46)  \nIn light of this , how could it make sense to pause the instant case (which was filed back in April \n2022) for at least some number of months (if not more) , when both sides here are advising the \nCourt that if things go as they should in the Ninth Circuit, the n a stay here will provide little to \nno benefit to the Court or the parties?  To ask the question is to answer it.4  See, e.g., Trevino v. \nGolden State FC, LLC , Lead Case No.: 1:18- cv-0120- DAD- BAM, 2019 WL 2710662, at *7 \n(E.D. Cal. June 28, 2019) (finding that a stay of the case pending resolution of an appeal in the \nfirst-filed case would not promote effic iency , where it was, inter alia , \u201cunclear whether the \ndecision in the [appeal] will be instructive for resolving [the instant case], since much of the \ndistrict court\u2019s analysis was based on\u201d facts specific to the first -filed case, \u201cwhich could differ \n \n4  During oral argument, the Court questioned Shopify\u2019s counsel about the fact that \nif the decision in Baton is upheld by the Ninth Circuit  (and even assuming that the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s decision read in such a way as to suggest that Shopify, Inc. should also be  dismissed on \nsimilar personal jurisdiction- type grounds in this case), this case would still have to go forward \nagainst three of the four Defendants here.  The Court asked why, in light of this, it would not \nmake more sense simply to keep this case moving forward now , instead of staying it ?  (Tr. at 28 -\n29)  To this, Shopify\u2019s counsel suggested that :  (1)  if the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Baton \nplaintiffs had not demonstrated that Shopify, Inc. is the alter ego of Shopify USA and (2) if this Court thereafter adopted a similar analysis and dismissed Shopify, Inc. from this case; then (3) this case as to the other Shopify Defendants will soon be over, because \u201cthose two companies \nreally don\u2019t have involvement in the claims and allegations [at issue] here.\u201d  ( Id. at 29- 33)  The \nCourt, however, cannot just assume that is so.  ( Id. at 32 -33; see also id . at 9 -11)  There is no \nrecord support for this assertion\u2014it is simply attorney argument.  ( Id.)  And Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel \ndisagreed with the assertion during the August 15 argument .  (Id. at 39- 40)  Thus, t he fact that a \nNinth Circuit affirmance would not lead to sure dismissal of this case as to three of four Defendants is also a factor in the Court\u2019s  decision as to why a stay at this stage does not make \nsense .   7 \n from the facts as alleged in the Consolidated Complaint before this court\u201d and it was likely that \nthe appellate court would issue \u201cits opinion before the undersigned is called on to resolve substantive motions in this case\u201d).   \nFor similar reasons, the Court declines to stay the case in light of the three discretionary \nstay-related factors.  The first of those factors ask s whether the stay will simplify the issues for  \ntrial.  Astellas US LLC v. Apotex Inc ., Civil Action No. 18-1675- CFC -CJB (Consolidated), 2021 \nWL 9031821, at *1 (D. Del. Feb. 19, 2021).  And for the reasons set out above, the Court cannot see how (absent a Ninth Circuit reversal, at which point the stay question could easily be revisited) staying this case in favor of the Baton appeal would simplify much of anything.  Th e \nanalysis as to the \u201csimplification\u201d  factor is so significant here (i.e., in favor of Plaintiffs\u2019 \nposition) that its impact  alone would require denial of the Motion. \nFor these reasons, the Motion is DENIED without prejudice to renew.   \n \nDated:  August 26, 2022   ____________________________________       Christopher J.
