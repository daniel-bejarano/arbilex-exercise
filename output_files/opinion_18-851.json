Amy Malkin. \nFebruary 7 , 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION ~~ -~ \nPlaintiff Vernon Ernest Dorian Cephas, an inmate at the James T. Vaughn \nCorrectional Center in Smyrna, Delaware , filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983.1 (D.I. 3). He appears prose and has been granted leave to proceed in forma \npauperis. (0.1. 7). The operative pleading consists of Docket Items 3, 9, 10 (sealed \nmedical records), and 19. (See 0.1. 21 at 10; 0.1. 22). Pending motions are a motion \nfor summary judgment and motion to strike, both filed by Defendant Deputy Warden \nScarborough. (0.1. 139, 152). The matters have been fully briefed. \nBACKGROUND \nThis matter proceeds on Count Two, a retaliation claim in violation of the First \nAmendment against Defendant.2 Plaintiff complains of actions taken both when he was \nan unsentenced detainee and a sentenced inmate at the JTVCC.3 The claim against \nDefendant is raised against him in his individual and official capacities. \nAs alleged, Plaintiff spoke to Defendant about a rash and explained he had been \nunsuccessful in getting treatment. Defendant advised Plaintiff that he would email \n1 When bringing a\u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived \nhim of a federal right, and the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of \nstate law. West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n2 Plaintiff also raises a medical needs claim against nurse Amy Malkin. (0.1. 21 at 10). \nClaims against nurse Malkin are stayed due to the suggestion of bankruptcy of \nConnections Community Support Programs , Inc. (See 0.1. 136, 144). \n3 Plaintiff was found guilty on September 13 , 2016, following a jury trial in the Superior \nCourt of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County, and sentenced on December 13, \n2016. See State v. Cephas, ID #150303005476 (Del. Super.). A convicted but \nunsentenced inmate has the same status under the Constitution as a pretrial detainee. \nSee Fuentes v. Wagner, 206 F.3d 336 (3d Cir. 2000). \n1 someone in medical so that Plaintiff would be seen. Plaintiff states, \"This too was \nunsuccessful. \" (0.1. 3 at 12, ffll 17-20). \nPlaintiff wrote to Warden Dana Metzger that he was not getting proper medical \ncare and had not received assistance from Defendant. (/d. at 12). Plaintiff continued to \nseek treatment and file grievances . (Id.). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant transferred \nhim from minimum security to medium high security (i.e., \"MHU\") on October 18 , 2017, \nin retaliation for the letter he sent to Warden Metzger complaining about Defendant's \nfailure to assist Plaintiff in obtaining medical care. (/d. at 17, 19). \nPlaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages , as well as declaratory and \ninjunctive relief. \nFACTS AS PRESENTED BY THE PARTIES \nPlaintiff frequently sought medical attention for chest pains and shortness of \nbreath following a September 2016 surgery. (0.1. 141 at 16-24). Plaintiff has chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\") and is prescribed an inhaler, a keep on person \n(i.e., KOP) medication. (/d. at 27-32, 103). Plaintiff testified that when an inmate needs \na prescription refilled, the must submit a \"sick call\" form. (Id. at 102-03). An inmate \nmust also submit a sick call slip or may ask a correctional officer when he needs \nmedical attention. (Id.). \nPlaintiff received medical treatment on a number of occasions between October \n2016 through mid-October 2017. (/d. at 16-30). Plaintiff testified that he spoke to \nDefendant about getting medical care for a rash but does not recall the date of the \nconversation. (Id. at 100-01). Defendant does not recall having this conversation . (Id. \nat 138). Plaintiff testified that he sent a letter to the warden through the in-house prison \n2 mail system sometime between July through September of 2017 (the \"first letter\") in \nwhich he told the warden that Defendant did not help him receive medical care for the \nrash.4 (Id. at 101 ). \nOn September 26, 2017, Plaintiff filled out a sick-call form for a KOP refill and \ncomplained of chest pain, recurring rash, and itchy eyes. (Id. at 54, 108, 109). Plaintiff \nexplained that he refused treatment that day even though he was having chest pains \nbecause he wanted his KOPs. (Id. at 108-09). On October 6, 2017, Plaintiff was having \nchest pains and, around 3:00 a.m., went to the correctional officer for medical attention. \n(Id. at 110). Plaintiff was seen as an emergency sick call because of the chest pain \ncomplaints he said had been occurring since the previous Saturday . (Id. at 18). He \n\"continued to mention [to multiple medical staff] having KOP medications re-ordered\" by \nthe provider. (Id.). The medical note states that Plaintiff did not appear to be in any \n\"distress\" and he was released in stable condition . (Id.). Plaintiff testified that he did not \nask for a medication refill. (Id. at 110). \nOn October 6, 2017, R.N. Tyler Bohanan issued Plaintiff a disciplinary report for \ngiving a false alarm and lying because Plaintiff \"abused an emergency sick call\" on \nOctober 6, 2017, in an attempt to have KOP medication filled. (Id. at 57). The report \nstates that Plaintiff was \"aware he can request medication refills through the sick call \nslip as he has done this process in the past.\" (Id.). The report stated that Plaintiff had a \nprior incident, on February 15, 2017, \"where [Plaintiff] had used an emergency sick call \n4 The letter was not provided to the Court. Plaintiff did not keep a copy of the letter, and \nthe letter was not located following a search of all correspondence received by the \nwarden in 2017. (D.I. 141 at 101, 128). \n3 so that he could get his medications filled.\" (Id.). On October 18, 2017, at \napproximately 12: 10 p.m. Plaintiff was found guilty of the violations and sanctioned to \nfive days confinement to quarters and fifteen days loss of all privileges . (Id. at 59). \nPlaintiffs appeal was denied. (Id. at 59-60). Defendant had no involvement in the \ndisciplinary action, the hearing, or appeal. (Id. at 138). \nOn October 18, 2017, at approximately 11 :57 a.m., Defendant ordered Plaintiffs \ntransfer from W1 to O-West. (Id. at 63). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant moved him \nfrom W1 to 0-West because of the 2017 letter Plaintiff wrote to the Warden. (D. I. 3 at \n17). Defendant states that he was not aware that Plaintiff had made the 2017 complaint \nat the time he ordered Plaintiffs transfer. (0.1. 114 at 138). Defendant states that \nPlaintiff was transferred to maintain prison safety and order and to ensure that Plaintiff \nwould receive prompt and proper emergency care for his medical issues. (Id. at 136). \nDefendant states that he was concerned that Plaintiffs behavior of calling in a false \nalarm could disrupt prison safety and order. (/d.). Defendant states that he ordered \nPlaintiffs move \"to a facility with higher security\" where Plaintiffs actions and \nmovements could be more closely monitored by security. (Id. at 137). Defendant states \nthat he also ordered the move so that if Plaintiff had a true medical emergency due to \nhis health issues, he would be minutes away from the infirmary at the O-West building \nand this would allow an emergency response team to reach Plaintiff more quickly than if \nhe were housed in the W1 building. (Id.). \nPlaintiff wrote the warden on March 30, 2018 and complained that Defendant \nretaliated against him because he had sent a complaint letter (i.e., the first letter) about \nDefendant to the warden \"back in August/September about my ongoing medical \n4 problems .\" (Id. at 67-72). The warden investigated Plaintiffs allegations of retaliation \nand reprisal. (Id. at 65). On April 11, 2018, Scarborough provided a memorandum to \nthe warden in response to Plaintiffs claims of retaliation. (Id. at 66). Defendant \nprovided two reasons for the transfer: \n[A]s per attached 404 incident report the inmate gave false alarm (medical \nemergency) in order to be taken to medical so he can complain about his \nKOP issues .... [O]n the off chance that the inmate does in fact have a \nmedical condition that may necessitate an occasional emergency \nresponse team to treat him on site; he will be located in a building much \ncloser to the infirmary than where he was previously housed. The \nresponse time will be significantly reduced .... Since this order went into \neffect there have been no documented instances of code 4 medical \nemergencies involving I/M Cephas. \n(Id. at 66). On April 24, 2018, the warden advised Plaintiff that \"after investigation into \nyour allegations of retaliation and reprisal, I do not have any cause to find truth in any of \nthe concerns given .... I hope this allays your concerns into this matter and I consider \nit closed at this time.\" (Id. at 65). \nPlaintiff submitted a grievance on November 21, 2019, complaining about the \ndisciplinary report that he received on October 15, 2017. (Id. at 88-93). In much of the \ngrievance Plaintiff complains that Defendant retaliated and had him transferred on \nOctober 18, 2017, for filing a complaint against Defendant with the warden. (Id. at 91-\n93). The grievance was returned unprocessed for several reasons including that the \ngrievance was filed more than seven days from the date of occurrence . (Id. at 94-95). \nDefendant moves for summary judgment: (1) on all claims against him in his \nofficial capacity; and, on the grounds that (2) Plaintiff cannot establish the essential \nelements of retaliation ; (3) Defendant has qualified immunity; and (4) Plaintiff failed to \nexhaust his administrative remedies . Plaintiff responded and filed a twelve paragraph \n5 declaration as well as the declaration of inmate Amir Fatir, all in opposition to \nDefendant's motion. (D.I. 149). Defendant moves to strike portions of the response \nand declarations . (D.I. 152). \nMOTION TO STRIKE \nDefendant moves to strike for a number of reasons. (0.1. 152). First, Defendant \nmoves to strike Plaintiff's response on the grounds that it exceeds the twenty page limit \nas set forth in this Court's Local Rules. See D. Del. LR 7.1.3(a)(4). Plaintiff did exceed \nthe page limit, and by a lot of pages, although , since it is handwritten , it is difficult to \ncompare it to the number of words that would be in twenty typed pages. I will therefore \ngive Plaintiff latitude in this regard given his pro se status. This portion of the motion to \nstrike will be denied. \nSecond, Defendant moves to strike paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 of \nPlaintiff's declaration and paragraphs 2 and 3 of Fatir's declaration. \"An affidavit or \ndeclaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge , \nset out facts that would be admissible in evidence , and show that the affiant or declarant \nis competent to testify on the matters stated.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). An affidavit \nwhich does not comply with the requirements of Rule 56 is subject to a motion to strike. \nWestern Mining Corp. v. Standard Terminals , Inc., 577 F. Supp. 847, 848 (W.D. Pa.), \naffd, 745 F.2d 49 (3d Cir. 1984). In supporting a motion for summary judgment , \"the \naffiant must ordinarily set forth facts, rather than opinions or conclusions. \" Maldonado \nv. Ramirez, 757 F.2d 48, 51 (3d Cir. 1985). \"An affidavit that is 'essentially conclusory \nand lacking in specific facts' is inadequate to satisfy the movant's burden.\" Id. (citations \nomitted). \n6 The Court will grant Defendant 's motion to strike paragraphs 2, 5, 6, and 8 of \nPlaintiffs declaration , and otherwise dismiss the request as moot. Paragraphs 2, 5, 6, \nand 8 are simply statements of belief. They would not be admissible in evidence. I do \nnot need to resolve the motion as to any of the other paragraphs. I accept as true that \nPlaintiff wrote the first letter and that he complained about Deputy Warden Scarborough \nin it.; that renders moot the request to strike paragraph 12 and paragraphs 2 and 3 of \nthe Fatir declaration . Paragraph 4 is a comment on the evidence . I treat it as such, and \nthere is no need to strike it. Paragraph 7 is a conclusory statement of historical fact. I \ndo not think it is necessary to strike it, because it does not affect the legal analysis of \nthe summary judgment motion. \nMOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nLegal Standards. \"Summary judgment is proper when, viewing the evidence in \nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all inferences in favor of \nthat party, there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Drumgo v. Kuschel, 811 F. App'x 115, 117 (3d \nCir. 2020) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). A fact in dispute is material when it \"might \naffect the outcome of the suit under the governing law\" and is genuine \" if the evidence is \nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,248 (1986). \"In considering a motion for summary \njudgment, a district court may not make credibility determinations or engage in any \nweighing of the evidence ; instead, the nonmoving party's evidence 'is to be believed \nand all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\"' Marino v. Industrial Crating \nCo., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Anderson , 477 U.S. at 255). A court's \n7 role in deciding a motion for summary judgment is not to evaluate the evidence and \ndecide the truth of the matter but rather \"to determine whether there is a genuine issue \nfor trial.\" Anderson , 477 U.S. at 249. \nA party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing the basis \nfor its motion and must demonstrate that there is an absence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). The burden then \nshifts to the nonmoving party to show that there is a \"genuine issue for trial.\" Id. at 324. \nTo withstand a properly supported motion for summary judgment , the nonmoving party \nmust identify specific facts and affirmative evidence that contradict the moving party. \nAnderson , 477 U.S. at 250. \nThere is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact\" if a party\" \"fails to make a \nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's \ncase.\" Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. \"If reasonable minds could differ as to the \nimport of the evidence ,\" however, summary judgment is not appropriate . See \nAnderson , 477 U.S. at 250-51. \nDiscussion. Defendant moves for summary judgment on the ground that \nPlaintiff cannot prove his retaliation claim. Plaintiff argues that there are genuine issues \nof material fact that preclude summary judgment. \n\"Retaliation for the exercise of constitutionally protected rights is itself a violation \nof rights secured by the Constitution actionable under\u00a7 1983.\" White v. Napoleon , 897 \nF .2d 103, 111-12 (3d Cir. 1990). Proof of a retaliation claim requires that a plaintiff \ndemonstrate : (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he was subjected to adverse \nactions by a state actor; and (3) the protected activity was a \"substantial or motivating \n8 factor\" in the state actor's decision to take adverse action. Carter v. McGrady, 292 F.3d \n152, 158 (3d Cir. 2002); see also Allah v. Seiverling , 229 F.3d 220 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"fact \nfinder could conclude ... that retaliatory continued placement in administrative \nconfinement would 'deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his First \nAmendment rights\"'). \nThe causation element requires a plaintiff to prove either: (1) an unusually \nsuggestive temporal proximity between the protected activity and the alleged retaliatory \naction, or (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing to establish a causal link. See \nLauren W ex rel. Jean W v. DeFlaminis , 480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir. 2007); Krouse v. \nAmerican Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 503-04 (3d Cir. 1997). \"[O]nce a prisoner \ndemonstrates that his exercise of a constitutional right was a substantial or motivating \nfactor in the challenged decision, the prison officials may still prevail by proving that they \nwould have made the same decision absent the protected conduct for reasons \nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.\" Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, \n334 (3d Cir. 2001 ). When analyzing a retaliation claim, courts consider that the task of \nprison administrators and staff is difficult, and that the decisions of prison officials \nrequire deference , particularly where prison security is concerned . Rauser, 241 F.3d at \n334. \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff cannot prove the essential elements of retaliation . \nPlaintiff has met the first element of a retaliation claim. He testified that in his first letter \nto the warden he complained of Defendant's failure to see that he obtained medical \ncare. He also met the second element (at least when viewed in the light most favorable \n9 to Plaintiff) -he was subjected to an adverse action by a state actor when Defendant \nScarborough ordered his transfer from W1 to D-West. \nPlaintiff has not met the third element of a retaliation claim. The record evidence \ndoes not show that the protected activity (i.e., the first letter) was a substantial or \nmotivating factor in Defendant 's decision to transfer Plaintiff to D-West. The record \nevidence indicates that Defendant was unaware of the first letter when he ordered \nPlaintiffs transfer to D-West on October 18, 2017. Plaintiff argues that because his \n2018 letter to the warden was forwarded to Defendant , one must conclude that the first \nletter was also forwarded to Defendant. There is no record evidence to support \nPlaintiffs position. It is thus unrefuted that Defendant was unaware of the first letter. \nPlaintiff therefore has not shown that the letter was a substantial or motivating factor in \nDefendant's decision to transfer Plaintiff. This is fatal to Plaintiffs retaliation claim. \nAssuming arguendo that Plaintiff made a prima facie case of retaliation , the \nrecord evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff was transferred for reasons reasonably \nrelated to a legitimate penological interest. Defendant's unrefuted statement is that \nPlaintiff was transferred to maintain prison safety and order and to ensure that Plaintiff \nwould receive prompt and proper emergency care for his medical issues. Plaintiff \nargues that because Defendant ordered Plaintiffs transfer to D-West thirty minutes \nbefore Plaintiff was found guilty of the disciplinary charges, this casts doubt on \nDefendant's stated reasons for the transfer. The record does not support Plaintiffs \nposition. Defendant's April 11, 2018, memorandum to the warden (0.1. 141 at 66) \ncontains no reference to Plaintiffs finding of guilt; it refers only to the incident report that \nPlaintiff gave a false alarm. Defendant's declaration (id. at 136, ,r 5) refers to the fact \n10 that Plaintiff was found guilty of lying and giving a false alarm. It does not state that the \nguilty finding was the reason for the transfer. \nPlaintiff also argues that Defendant's response in transferring him was overblown \nand exaggerated because Plaintiff never caused a Code 4 medical emergency and the \nreasons for the transfer are based on hypothetical reasons or events that never \nhappened. Based upon the record evidence , as Defendant stated in his memorandum \nto the warden, he relied upon an incident report that Plaintiff gave a false alarm in order \nto be taken to medical to complain about KOP issues. Notably, the disciplinary report \nauthored by Bohanan states that Plaintiff indicated he went to sick call to see a provider \nto get a refill on his KOP medications and it was Bohanan who determined that Plaintiff \n\"abused an emergency sick call at the cost of valuable staff time and resources. \" \nDefendant's statement and his explanatory memorandum provide a logical explanation \nfor Plaintiff's transfer.5 \nIn light of the record evidence, no reasonable jury could find for Plaintiff. \nAccordingly , Defendant's motion for summary judgment will be granted.6 \n5 Plaintiff's statement in his declaration that he \"never misused the sick call process\" \ndoes not create a disputed material fact because it does not dispute that R.N. Bohanan \nwrote him up for doing just that, and that Defendant relied upon the written report in \nmaking the transfer decision. \n6 Summary judgment is appropriate on the retaliation claim. I will not address the other \ngrounds for summary judgment other than to note that Defendant has immunity under \nthe Eleventh Amendment for those claims raised against him in his official capacity. \n11 CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant in part and dismiss in part \nDefendant's motion to strike (D.I. 152); and (2) grant Defendant's motion for summary \njudgment(D.1.139) . \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n12 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nVERNON ERNEST DORIAN CEPHAS , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nDEPUTY WARDEN SCARBOROUGH , \net al., \nDefendants . : Civil Action No. 18-851-RGA \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 7 day of February, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date; \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1. Defendant 's motion to strike (D.I. 152) is GRANTED in part and \nDISMISSED in part. \n2. Defendant's motion for summary judgment (D.I. 139) is GRANTED . \n3. At the close of case, the Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment in \nfavor of Defendant Deputy Warden Scarborough and against Plaintiff. "}
