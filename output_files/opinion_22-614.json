No. 22-614-CFC \nEric Stephenson, Newark, Delaware, Prose Plaintiff. \nGeoffrey Graham Grivner, Esquire, Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC, \nWilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendant. \nMarch 27, 2023 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION c~l.~ge: \nOn May 9, 2022, Plaintiff Eric Stephenson, who appears prose and has paid \nthe filing fee, commenced this employment discrimination action, pursuant to the \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights of 1964, as amended. (D.I. 1, 3) Before the Court is \nDefendant's motion to dismiss the Complaint. (D.I. 7) The matter is fully \nbriefed. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and are assumed to be true \nfor purposes of deciding the pending motion. See Umland v. PLAN CO Fin. \nServs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). In March 2021, Plaintiff had an \ninterview via Zoom with Seth White, an employee of non-party recruiting agency \nCollabera. (D.I. 1-1 at 3; D.I. 3 at 1) The interview was for a position as a \n\"Sales Force Architect\" with Defendant Bank of America. (D.I. 1-1 at 3; D.I. 3 at \n1) At the end of the call, White told Plaintiff\"that 'it's rare to hire US citizens' \nfor a 'Salesforce Architect' Leadership role in the 'small business / wealth \nmanagement space' at BOA's Texas location.\" (D.I. 3 at 1) About two weeks \nlater, Plaintiff was informed that \"the manager decided to move forward with \nanother candidate\" for the position. (D.I. 1-1 at 3) Plaintiff claims that he was \nnot hired because of his race (Caucasian) and national origin (the United States). \n1 (D.I. 1 at 1-3; D.I. 3 at 1)1 Plaintiff also alleges that he applied for two more \npositions in March and April 2021. (D.I. 3 at 1) \nIn its motion to dismiss, Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to state an \nemployment-discrimination claim because he failed to explain the circumstances of \nWhite's alleged statement such that it would implicate Defendant's culpability in \ndiscriminating against him. (D.I. 7, 8) In his response, Plaintiff asserts some \nnew allegations. (D.I. 9) As relevant, Plaintiff alleges that, after White \ndescribed the job details to him, Plaintiff \"verbally responded with examples of \nsimilar work experiences to show he was qualified for the job at BOA.\" (Id. at 7) \nAdditionally, Plaintiff alleges that all his other communications regarding the \nposition were with another Collabera employee named Krishna Gurjar, who sent \nPlaintiff a request to apply and \"the Right to Represent,\" set up the meeting with \nWhite, and notified Plaintiff of \"the rejection.\" (Id.) Finally, Plaintiff alleges \nthat the \"Right to Represent\" was \"a contract where the Plaintiff ... agreed with \nCollabera's Recruiters to give, Collabera the right to represent [him] to Bank of \nAmerica for Titled Job Salesforce Architect.\" (Id.) In its reply, Defendant notes \n1 In his EEOC complaint, in addition to claiming discrimination based on his race \nand national origin, Plaintiff cited his age ( 45) as a basis for the alleged \ndiscrimination. (D.I. 1-1 at 3) But he has not claimed discrimination based on \nhis age in this Court, and he has not supported such a claim with any relevant \nfactual allegations. \n2 that Plaintiff's response confirmed that he interacted only with Collabera's \nemployees, rather than employees of Defendant. (D.L 10 at 4) Plaintiff later \nfiled a document titled \"More Complaint Job Clarification & Exhibits,\" in which \nhe appeared to clarify that he applied directly through Defendant's website for the \ntwo additional positions referenced in his Complaint, which were the same or \nsimilar to the position for which he applied via Collabera, and his candidacy did \nnot advance. (D.I. 14) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. l 2{b )( 6), the \nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the \nlight most favorable to Plaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). \nBecause Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nComplaint, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards \nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94. \nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to \nthe complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \"could not raise a claim \nof entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \n\"Though 'detailed factual allegations' are not required, a complaint must do more \nthan simply provide 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the \n3 elements of a cause of action.\"' Davis v. Abington Mem 'l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, \n241 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). The Court is \"not \nrequired to credit bald assertions or legal conclusions improperly alleged in the \ncomplaint.\" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F .3d 198, 216 (3d \nCir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed, however, \"for imperfect statement \nof the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\" Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 \nU.S. 10, 11 (2014). \nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \n\"substantive plausibility.\" Id. at 12. That plausibility must be found on the face \nof the complaint. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"A claim has \nfacial plausibility when the [ complainant] pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the [ accused] is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.\" Id. Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial \nexperience and common sense.\" Id. at 679. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nEstablishing a prima facie employment-discrimination claim for failure to \nhire requires a plaintiff to adequately allege that: ( 1) he belongs to a protected \nclass; (2) he had the requisite qualifications for the position; (3) despite his \nqualifications, he was not hired; and (4) after his rejection, the position remained \n4 open, or was filled in a manner giving rise to an inference of discrimination. See \nSarullo v. United States Postal Serv., 352 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2003) (per \ncuriam). \"[F]or purposes of pleading sufficiency,\" however, \"a complaint need \nnot establish aprimafacie case in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\" \nConnelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 788 (3d Cir. 2016) (footnote \nomitted). This is so because \"[a] primafacie case is 'an evidentiary standard, not \na pleading requirement,' and hence is 'not a proper measure of whether a \ncomplaint fails to state a claim.\"' Id. at 789 ( quoting Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, \nN.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510 (2002), and Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, \n213 (3d Cir. 2009)). The post-Twombly pleading standard, rather than requiring \nthe establishment of a primafacie case, \"'simply calls for enough facts to raise a \nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary \nelement[s].\"' Id. (quoting Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224,234 (3d \nCir. 2008) (alteration original). \nHere, the statement attributed to White, that it is rare for Defendant to hire \nUnited States citizens in the position for which Plaintiff applied, appears merely to \nbe White's anecdotal commentary, informed or ill-informed, about a hiring pattern \nhe believes to have observed from Defendant. This statement, by an employee of \nnon-party Collabera, is simply too lacking in context to be attributed to Defendant \n5 in any legally significant way. For this reason, the Complaint fails to state a \nclaim for employment discrimination against Defendant. \nAs noted, Plaintiffs allegations continued to evolve in later filings. The \ngeneral rule is that a complaint may not be amended through an opposition brief, \nand new facts may not be considered by a court ruling on a motion to dismiss. \nSee Pennsylvania ex rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, Inc., 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. \n1988) (citing Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. \n1984)) (\"[l]t is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in \nopposition to a motion to dismiss.\"). \nEven were the Court to consider Plaintiffs new allegations, asserted in \nresponse to the motion to dismiss and in the \"More Complaint Job Clarification & \nExhibits\" filing, they would not save his claim. To the contrary, his new \nallegations underscore the shortcomings of the claim. \nPlaintiffs new allegations help contextualize White's comment, but not in a \nmanner that helps his case. The fairest reading of all of Plaintiffs allegations \ntogether is as follows. He interviewed with Collabera, a third-party recruiter, for \nconsideration to be put forth to Defendant as a potential candidate for a position as \na Sales Force Architect. To this end, Plaintiff signed a \"Right to Represent\" \ncontract permitting Collabera to advocate for his candidacy-provided, of course, \nthat Collabera deemed him to be a viable candidate for the position following an \n6 interview. Following the interview with White, however, another Collabera \nemployee, Gurjar, advised Plaintiff that a manager in Collabera, possibly even \nWhite himself, had decided that Plaintiff would not be put forth to Defendant as a \ncandidate. \nA reasonable inference may be drawn from Plaintiffs allegations that \nCollabera came to this conclusion based on White's apparent perception that \nDefendant rarely hires United States citizens for the position. But attributing \nCollabera' s decision to not move foiward with Plaintiffs candidacy to \ndiscrimination on the part Defendant, who played no role in the decision, is simply \ntoo attenuated to state a claim.2 \nPerhaps an inference could have been drawn from the allegations in \nComplaint that Collabera was directly tasked with conducting all of Defendant's \nhiring, thus possibly establishing a link between White's alleged statement and \nDefendant. Plaintiff, however, made clear in the \"More Complaint Job \nClarification & Exhibits\" filing, that applicants can apply directly through \nDefendant's website for the same or similar positions rather than through a third\u00ad\nparty recruiter like Collabera. \n2 Plaintiffs claim that Defendant discriminated against him based on his race fails \nfor the same fundamental reason that his claim based on national origin fails\u00ad\nthere are no plausible factual allegations suggesting that his candidacy was ever \npresented to Defendant. \n7 As described above, Plaintiff has already effectively amended the Complaint \ntwice in responding to Defendant's motion to dismiss, and the amendments have \nmade Defendant's lack of culpability clear. Accordingly, the Court concludes \nthat a third amendment would be futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., \n293 F .3d 103, 108, 111 (3d Cir. 2002). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will grant Defendant's motion to \ndismiss. \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n8 "}
