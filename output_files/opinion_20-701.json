(D.I. 14). I held a three-day bench trial on \nMarch 14--17. (D.I. 132-34, hereinafter \"Tr.\"). The parties have submitted post-trial briefing \nand proposed findings of fact. (D.I. 136-140). For the following reasons, I find that Plaintiffs \nhave shown trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), false designation of origin under \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), and trademark dilution under 6 Del. C. \u00a7 3313. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs are a financial data and analysis company . (Tr. 34:19-24). Standard & Poor's \nemerged in the 1940s and formed the S&P 500 index in the 1950s to track the general \nperformance of the U.S. stock market. (Tr. 34:1-36:10). In the 1960s, Standard & Poor's was \nacquired by McGraw Hill. (Tr. 34:15-18). In addition to indices such as the S&P 500, Plaintiffs \nprovide debt ratings, benchmarking, intellectual property licensing, and research and quantitative \nsolutions. (Tr. 122:22-25) . Plaintiffs ' licensees include Vanguard , Schwab, and Fidelity. (Tr. \n113:14--21). \nDefendants provide contact center services. (Tr. 395: 17-19). Contact centers handle \ncommunications with a company's customers regarding that company's products or services. \n(Tr. 395:20-396:1). Dan Plashkes, Defendant's current CEO, and Michael Shear founded S&P \nData in Canada in 1986. (Tr. 397:6, 398:6-11). In 1996, Plashkes sold S&P Data to a private \nequity firm. (Tr. 402:7-403:1) . In 2004, Plashkes and David Borts formed a new company, also \n2 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 2 of 37 PageID #: 3270called S&P Data, in the United States to provide contact center services. (Tr. 406:6-13; 480:18-\n19). Since 2004, S&P Data has opened multiple call centers in the United States and employs \n2500 employees. (Tr. 449:16-17; DTX-40; DTX-51). Defendan ts' clients have included \nMercedes-Benz , Unilever, American Express, and T-Mobile. (Tr. 396:9-14 ). \nII. TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT AND FALSE DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN \nA. LegalStandard \nTo prove trademark infringement under\u00a7 32(1) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), \n\"a plaintiff must show that: (1) the mark is valid and legally protectable; (2) the mark is owned \nby the plaintiff; and (3) the defendant's use of the mark to identify goods or services is likely to \ncreate confusion concerning the origin of the goods or services.\" Fisons Horticulture , Inc. v. \nVigoro Indus., Inc., 30 F.3d 466, 472 (3d Cir. 1994). \"Likelihood of confusion is also the test for \nactions brought under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(l)(A) for unfair \ncompetition to prevent false representations as to the source or origin of goods or services by a \nmark confusingl y similar to one already in use.\" Id. at 4 73. \nB. Findings of Fact \n1. Plaintiffs own valid federal marks for the asserted trademarks. \n2. Plaintiffs have priority over Defendants . \n3. Plaintiffs have a family of marks in S&P, S&P 100, S&P 1000, S&P 500, S&P 500 \nCATHOLIC VALUES INDEX, S&P 500 DYNAMIC VEQTOR IND~X, S&P LOW \nVOLATILITY INDEX , S&P VEQTOR , S&P AGGREGATE , S&P CAPITAL IQ, S&P \nCHINA 500, S&P COMPOSITE 1500, S&P GIVI, S&P GLOBAL , S&P GLOBAL \nMARKET INTELLIGENCE , S&P HIGH YIELD DIVIDEND ARISTOCRATS , S&P \nL TVC GLOBAL INDEX, S&P MIDCAP 400, S&P PRISM, S&P SMALLCAP 600, \n3 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 3 of 37 PageID #: 3271S&P STRIDE, S&P STRIDE TIPS-LOCKBOX , S&P U.S. RETIREE SPENDING \nINDEX, and S&P WCI. \n4. Plaintiffs ' and Defendants ' marks are similar. The first Lapp factor favors Plaintiffs. \n5. Plaintiffs ' marks are commerciall y and conceptually strong. The second Lapp factor \nfavors Plaintiffs. \n6. Plaintiffs and Defendants sell expensive goods and services to a sophisticated buyer \nclass. The third Lapp factor favors Defendants. \n7. Defendants used the mark for approximatel y ten years without evidence of confusion. \nThe fourth Lapp factor slightly favors Defendants. \n8. Defendants knew about Plaintiffs ' marks but had reasonable explanations for their choice \nof \"S&P Data.\" The fifth Lapp factor favors neither party. \n9. There are at least three documented instances of initial interest confusion. The sixth \nLapp factor favors Plaintiffs . \n10. The parties' channels of trade and advertisement do not have significant overlap. The \nseventh Lapp factor favors Defendants. \n11. Plaintiffs and Defendants both target firms in the financial industry. The eighth Lapp \nfactor favors Plaintiffs. \n12. Plaintiffs ' and Defendants ' services and products are different and serve different \nfunctions for purchasers . The ninth Lapp factor favors Defendants . \n13. There is no evidence that Plaintiffs or Defendants will seek to expand into each other's \nmarkets. The tenth Lapp factor favors Defendants. \n14. Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of confusion between Plaintiffs' S&P marks and \nDefendants ' S&P Data mark. \n4 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 4 of 37 PageID #: 3272C. Discussion \nAs a preliminary matter, Defendants do not contest validity or priority. (See D.I. 139). \nPlaintiffs own valid marks and Plaintiffs ' use has priority over Defendants' use. \n1. Plaintiff's \"S&P\" Marks Constitute a Family of Trademarks \nPlaintiffs assert that their collection of S&P Marks constitutes a family of trademarks. \n\"A family of marks is a group of marks having a recognizable common characteristic, wherein \nthe marks are composed and used in such a way that the public associates not only the individual \nmarks, but the common characteristic of the family, with the trademark owner.\" J & J Snack \nFoods Corp. v. McDonald's Corp., 932 F.2d 1460, 1462 (Fed. Cir. 1991). I must consider the \n\"use, advertisement , and distinctiveness of the marks, including assessment of the contribution of \nthe common feature to the recognition of the marks as of common origin.\" Id. at 1463. \nAll of Plaintiffs' asserted marks begin with \"S&P\" followed by a descriptor identifying \ngeographic locations, market segments, or other non-distinctive features of the good or service. \n(Tr. 335:11-17). Plaintiffs have advertised their S&P marks together. (PTX-94 at P-10148, P-\nl 0245; Tr. 4 7 :5-17). Many of Plaintiffs ' marks designate the investment focus of an index. \n(D.I. 115 at 4--21). Others, such as S&P Global Market Intelligence, tend to designate a good or \nservice related to financial news, market research, and investment information. (Id. at 11 ). \nPlaintiffs have used \"S&P\" to advertise their goods and services since the 1940s; the S&P 500 \nwas first introduced in the 1950s. (Tr. 34:19-36:23). Plaintiffs obtained trademarks on S&P 500 \nand S&P 100 in 1987. (PTX-091 at P-1, P-167) \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs ' own internal research showed that appending \"Global\" \nto \"S&P\" decreased recognition among finance professionals and policy influencers from 2015 \nto 2016. (D.I. 139 at 2). Thus, according to Defendants, \"S&P\" is not a \"common characteristic \n5 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 5 of 37 PageID #: 3273[that] is indicative of a common origin of the goods.\" (Id. (citing J&J Snack Foods, 932 F.2d at \n1462). The survey is based on \"unaided awareness\" questions, such as, \"when you think of \ncompanies in the financial intelligence data and analytics industry, which ones come to mind?\" \n(Tr. 69:5-70:6). In 2015, unaided awareness of S&P and Standard & Poor's had been 11 %, \nwhile in 2017, unaided awareness of S&P Global was 6%. (DTX-86 at P-009734 ). Without \nmore context, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from this market research. There is no \ninformation on how the survey was prepared and executed. I give this evidence little weight. \nPlaintiffs have shown a long usage of their marks for similar goods and services. As \ndiscussed below, \"S&P\" itself is a strong mark. The marks have been advertised together in such \na way that \"S&P\" is a recognizable common characteristic. Plaintiffs have shown that they hold \na family of marks under the \"S&P\" house mark. \n2. The Lapp Factors \nTo prove trademark infringement , Plaintiffs must show a likelihood of confusion. In the \nThird Circuit, likelihood of confusion is determined by the so-called Lapp factors: \n(1) the degree of similarity between the owner's mark and the alleged infringing mark; (2) \nthe strength of the owner's mark; (3) the price of the goods and other factors indicative of \nthe care and attention expected of consumers when making a purchase; ( 4) the length of \ntime the defendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion arising; (5) \nthe intent of the defendant in adopting the mark; ( 6) the evidence of actual confusion; (7) \nwhether the goods, though not competing , are marketed through the same channels of \ntrade and advertised through the same media; (8) the extent to which the targets of the \nparties' sales efforts are the same; (9) the relationship of the goods in the minds of \nconsumers because of the similarity of function; (10) other facts suggesting that the \nconsuming public might expect the prior owner to manufacture a product in the \ndefendant's market, or that he is likely to expand into that market. \nInterpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc., 721 F.2d 460,463 (3d Cir. 1983). No one factor is outcome \ndeterminative. \"[E]ach factor must be weighed and balanced one against the other.\" Checkpoint \n6 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 6 of 37 PageID #: 3274Sys., Inc. v. Check Point Software Techs., Inc., 269 F.3d 270, 280 (3d Cir. 2001). I will consider \neach factor in turn. \na. Degree of Similarity \nMarks are confusingl y similar \"if ordinary consumers would likely conclude that [the two \nproducts] share a common source, affiliation, connection or sponsorship.\" Sabinsa Corp. v. \nCreative Compounds , LLC, 609 F.3d 175, 183 (3d Cir. 2010). \nHere, the marks share \"S&P.\" Plaintiffs argue that \"S&P\" is the dominant feature of the \nmarks, and accordingly favors a finding of similarity. (D.I. 136 at 7). I agree. S&P is a \n\"'prominent feature' as the first word in the mark.\" Palm Bay Imports, Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot \nPonsardin Maison Fondee en 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Furthermore , \"S&P\" \nis conceptually strong as an arbitrary mark, as discussed below. \"The presence of this strong \ndistinctive term as the first word in both parties' marks renders the marks similar .... \" Id. \nAs compared to Plaintiffs ' \"S&P\" mark, Defendants ' \"S&P Data\" merely appends a \ngeneric term to the more prominent \"S&P.\" \"A subsequent user may not avoid likely confusion \nby appropriating another's entire mark and adding descriptive or non-descriptive matter to it.\" \nFisons, 30 F.3d at 477 (cleaned up). \nIn the context of Plaintiffs ' family of marks, Plaintiffs ' marks and Defendants' mark both \nuse non-distinctive words following \"S&P.\" \"In comparing the senior user's family of marks \nwith the junior user's mark, the question is not whether the junior user's mark is similar to the \nsenior user's individual marks, but whether the junior user's mark would be likely to be viewed \nas a member of the senior user's family of marks.\" 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair \nCompetition\u00a7 23:61 (5th ed. 2022) [hereinafter McCarthy] (cleaned up). \n7 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 7 of 37 PageID #: 3275Plaintiffs argue that \"data\" is essential to Plaintiffs' business and is naturally associated \nwith their services. (D.I. 136 at 8). Plaintiffs point to news articles discussing \"data\" in close \nproximity to the S&P mark, including as part of the phrase \"S&P data.\" (Tr. 41:5-43:14; PTX-\n123). S&P Global Dow Jones Indices and S&P Global Market Intelligence provide financial \ndata and analytics. (Tr. 38:2-7; Tr. 97:22-100:24). Thus, Defendants' marks are likely to be \nviewed as a member of Plaintiffs ' family of marks. \nDefendants respond that the logos create a distinct visual impression. A side-by-side \ncomparison of the logos is not the proper method for analysis when the products are not usually \nsold in such a fashion. A & H Sportswear , Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237 F.3d 198, \n216 (3d Cir. 2000). \"Instead, an effort must be made to move into the mind of the roving \nconsumer.\" Id Courts determine similarity by evaluating the overall impression created by the \nsight, sound, and meaning of the marks. Sabinsa, 609 F.3d at 183. Here, while the logos have a \ndifferent feel, Defendants ' services are often pitched verbally through cold calls. (Tr. 453:6-21). \n\"S&P Data\" sounds similar to \"S&P,\" especially where \"Data\" is a generic term and \"S&P\" is \nthe first word. As discussed above, the word marks themselves are strikingly similar. Thus, \nwhile the logos are distinct, the sight, sound, and meaning of the marks are substantially similar. \nThe degree of similarity favors Plaintiffs. \nb. Strength of Plaintiffs' Marks \nStronger marks are more likely to cause confusion. See Versa Prods. Co. v. Bifold Co. \n(Mfg.), 50 F.3d 189,203 (3d Cir. 1995). A trademark 's strength is based on the mark's \nconceptual distinctiveness and commercial strength. Fisons, 30 F.3d at 479. \nConceptual distinctiveness is measured along a spectrum ranging from generic (low \ndistinctiveness) to arbitrary or fanciful (high distinctiveness) . Sabinsa, 609 F.3d at 185. \n8 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 8 of 37 PageID #: 3276\"Arbitrary or fanciful marks use terms that neither describe nor suggest anything about the \nproduct.\" Id. The parties agree that Plaintiffs ' marks are arbitrary. (D.I. 136 at 9-10; D.I. 139 at \n6 n.2). \nCommercial strength concerns the mark's marketplace recognition . Commercial strength \nmay be measured by the extensiveness of advertising and sales. Acxiom Corp. v. Axiom, Inc., 27 \nF. Supp. 2d 478,496 (D. Del. 1998). Plaintiffs offer the following evidence of commercial \nstrength: \n\u2022 Annual spending of at least $33 million to advertise to the general public and \ntarget audiences through newsletters , holiday cards, radio placements , and digital \nand print advertisements . (Tr. 44:11-45 :17; PTX-94; PTX-104) . \n\u2022 Marketing through public websites, social media pages, and earned media \ncoverage throughout the country. (Tr. 120:15-17 ; 47:18-25; PTX-94; PTX-122 ; \nTr. 42:19-24; 52:11-53:8). \n\u2022 A period of use dating back to the 1940's. (Tr. 34:1-11). \n\u2022 Survey evidence (the \"Poret survey\") showing a 67% rate of recognition among \nmembers of the general public. (Tr. 149:9-13, 151:10-15; PTX-161) . \n\u2022 Brand valuation of more than $6 billion by Brand Finance. (PTX-117 at P-9945; \nTr. 60:2-16). \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to show that their marks are strong in \nDefendants' market. The Third Circuit has held \"that courts must look at the strength of the \nmark in the industry in which infringement is alleged.\" Checkpoint Sys., Inc. v. Check Point \nSoftware Techs., Inc., 269 F.3d 270,284 (3d Cir. 2001). In Checkpoint, the plaintiffs mark was \nsuggestive or descriptive and had acquired a secondary meaning . Id. at 283. The mark was \nstrong in the field of physical surveillance. Id. at 284. In the corporate security market, \nhowever, the mark was not conceptually strong because it had not acquired secondary meaning \nwithin that market. Id. Because the infringement \"extend[ ed] beyond the physical article \nsecurity field into other, broader segments of the security industry,\" it was proper for the District \nCourt to consider the mark's strength in the field of infringement. Id. \n9 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 9 of 37 PageID #: 3277There is little direct evidence of the strength of S&P's marks in Defendants ' industry, but \nI think this case is distinguishable from Checkpoint. Plaintiffs here have a conceptually stronger \nmark than did the Checkpoint plaintiff. \"S&P\" is at the highest level of conceptual \ndistinctiveness , unlike the Checkpoint mark, which was merely suggestive or descriptive. \nPlaintiffs have presented extensive evidence of commercial strength, including evidence of \ncommercial strength within the general public. The general public includes Defendants' \nindustry. This is unlike Checkpoint, where there was \"no evidence that Checkpoint Systems \nspent a substantial amount of resources in advertising in this market, nor is there any evidence \nthat Checkpoint Systems has achieved mark recognition in this segment of the industry.\" 269 \nF.3d at 283-84. Finally, there is at least some evidence of actual confusion within Defendants ' \nindustry, as discussed below, which suggests that at least some people in Defendants' industry \nrecognized Plaintiffs ' marks. \nDefendants criticize Plaintiffs ' reliance on the Brand Finance valuation because it is \nprimarily a financial score. (D.I. 139 at 6-7). Discounting the brand valuation evidence does not \nchange my analysis because there is plenty of other evidence of the commercial strength of the \nS&P marks. Accordingly, I find that Plaintiffs' marks are strong. \nThe strength of Plaintiffs ' marks weighs in favor of Plaintiffs. \nc. Care and Attention of Consumers \n\"Where the relevant products are expensive, or the buyer class consists of sophisticated \nor professional purchasers, courts have generally not found Lanham Act violations. \" Checkpoint, \n269 F.3d at 284. \nHere, the buyer class is sophisticated. Both Plaintiffs' and Defendants ' services are \nexpensive. Plaintiffs ' services are divided into three pricing tiers: primary clients with contracts \n10 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 10 of 37 PageID #: 3278less than $50,000; core clients with contracts in the range of $50,000 to $1 million; strategic \nclients with contracts more than $1 million. (Tr. 76:23-77 :13). Defendants ' services are priced \nfrom several hundred thousand to over a million dollars each month. (Tr. 453 :22-24). \nBoth Plaintiffs and Defendants enter into contracts with their clients. Plaintiffs negotiate \ncontracts on a \"customer-by-customer basis\" and negotiations can take months. (Tr. 74:-75:7, \n77:17-19; 135:19-21). Defendants typically enter into long-term contracts with their clients. \n(Tr. 457:1-13). It takes three to six months to negotiate such contracts. (Tr. 454:18-20). \nPlaintiffs advance a theory that each party engages in a business-to-business-to-consumer \n(\"B-to-B-to-C\") model, and that I must consider the care and attention of the relevant end \nconsumers . (D.I. 136 at 11-12). I disagree. \nSome background is necessary to understand Plaintiffs ' B-to-B-to-C theory. Plaintiffs \nlicense their intellectual property so that their clients can create investment vehicles that track a \nparticular index ( e.g., \"S&P 500\") and offer those vehicles to the public under the S&P brand. \n(Tr. 111:11-112:22; PTX-90 at P-10364). Plaintiffs ' clients are the second \"business\" in the B\u00ad\nto-B-to-C model, while the second business's customers are the final \"consumer. \" \nDefendants provide call center services to large companies. Defendants handle \ncommunications with the large companies ' customers . Under Plaintiffs' theory, Defendants ' \nclients-the large companies-are the second \"business,\" while the large companies' customers \nare the \"consumers. \" \nThe \"C\" in Plaintiff's B-to-B-to-C model is not the \"relevant consumer[] \" in this case. \nKos Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 715 (3d Cir. 2004). While there might be some \nfactual scenarios where an indirect purchaser is the relevant consumer , Plaintiffs ' model is \nunpersuasive here. One gaping hole in Plaintiffs ' theory is that the ultimate \"consumers\" in \n11 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 11 of 37 PageID #: 3279Defendants ' business model are not seeking to purchase \"S&P Data\" services. They are seeking \nto resolve an issue or purchase a product from Defendants ' clients. Many times, they do not \neven know they are interacting with Defendants , as opposed to Defendants ' client. (Tr. 459:25-\n460:9). Accordingly , I reject Plaintiffs ' argument. \nPlaintiffs also argue that there is a substantial likelihood of confusion among the parties' \ndirect customers. (D.I. 136 at 11). They cite Kos in support of this proposition. Kos, however, \nconcerned two cholesterol-altering drugs named ADVICOR and AL TOCOR. 369 F.3d at 703. \nThe parties disputed whether physicians , a professional class, would nevertheless be susceptible \nto confusion. The Third Circuit held, \"There is no reason to believe that medical expertise as to \nproducts will obviate confusion as to source or affiliation or other factors affecting goodwill. \" \nId at 71 7. The present case is different. The parties sell very different types of services. The \ntransactions happen over a much longer period of time than it takes for a physician to write a \nprescription. Any initial confusion regarding the source would be quickly dissolved. Indeed, as \ndiscussed below, the evidence of actual confusion shows that potential clients realized fairly \nquickly that Defendants were not affiliated with Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs also cite Acxiom, in which the Court rejected the argument that a lengthy sales \nprocess eliminated the potential for confusion. 27 F. Supp. 2d at 497. In the more recent \nCheckpoint case, the Third Circuit considered initial interest confusion in the context of the sixth \nLapp factor, evidence of actual confusion. 269 F.3d at 292. I think the arguments about initial \ninterest confusion evidence are best considered in the context of evidence of actual confusion . \nThe third Lapp factor, \"the price of the goods and other factors indicative of the care and \nattention expected of consumers when making a purchase,\" weighs in favor of Defendants. \nd. Defendants' Use Without Confusion \n12 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 12 of 37 PageID #: 3280Defendant s named the company S&P Data in 2004. (Tr. 406:6-13 ). The earliest \ndocumented incident of confusion was in 2014. (DTX-41, Tr. 286: 1-7). Defendants argue this \nperiod of use without confusion weighs in their favor. Plaintiffs argue that, before 2014, \nDefendants were promoting their company under the name \"SP Data.\" (D.I. 140 at 5). For \ninstance, the website was changed around 2014 from \"SP Data\" to \"S&P Data.\" (PTX-88; DTX-\n185; Tr. 467 :23-468 :6). Defendants point to evidence that \"SP Data\" and \"S&P Data\" were \nused concurrentl y. (Tr. 489:14-23; DTX-23; DTX-179 ; PTX-55). I think the evidence shows \nthat there was at least some use of \"S&P Data\" during that period, though the website-the most \npublic-facing marketing-used \"SP Data.\" Accordingl y, this factor weighs slightly in favor of \nDefendants . \ne. Defendants' Intent \n\"[E]vidence of intentional , willful and admitted adoption of a mark closely similar to the \nexisting mark\u008f weighs strongly in favor of finding [a] likelihood of confusion. \" Checkpoint , \n269 F.3d at 286 (quotation omitted). I must consider the \"adequacy and care with which a \ndefendant investigates and evaluates its proposed mark, and its knowledge of similar marks.\" \nKos, 369 F.3d at 721. \nSome background is necessary to understand the parties' positions on this point. In 1986, \nDan Plashkes and Michael Shear founded S&P Data Corp. in Canada as a contact center. (Tr. \n397:6, 395:13-14 ; DTX-10). Plaintiffs ' parent, McGraw Hill, opposed S&P Data Corp.'s \napplications to register for trademarks in Canada, although the ultimate resolution of the dispute \nis unclear. (PTX-12, PTX-13, PTX-14, PTX-15, PTX-76; Tr. 247:2-8, 248:8-250:23, 262:20-\n264:15). Mr. Plashkes, the co-founder of the present S&P Data, was aware of McGraw Hill's \nopposition , although he was not affiliated with the company at the time and did not participate in \n13 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 13 of 37 PageID #: 3281the response. (Tr. 403:5-404:6 , 415:10-14, 417:14-23). David Borts, another co-founder of the \npresent S&P Data, testified that McGraw Hill's objection was \"in the back of our minds\" when \nPlashkes and Borts chose to incorporate as S&P Data in the United States. (Tr. 496: 13). \nPlaintiffs argue that (1) S&P's registration provides constructi ve notice of their rights in \nthe S&P marks, and (2) Defendants ' principals Mr. Plashkes and Mr. Borts were \"on notice of \nS&P's potential objections by virtue of prior complaints raised by McGraw-Hill , S&P's \npredecessor , to the registration and use of S&P Data in Canada by Mr. Plashkes' earlier \nCanadian company.\" (D.I. 136 at 14-15). \nDefendants argue that ( 1) S&P incorporates the surname initial of each co-founder of the \nearlier Canadian company (i.e., Shears and Plashkes), and (2) \"(w]hen reestablishing S&P Data \nin the United States, previous clients still knew them by the name S&P Data.\" (D.I. 139 at 9-\n10). Defendants also argue, \"McGraw-Hill did not request that S&P Data cease using its name; \nto the contrary, McGraw-Hill expressly stated it had no concern with the use of S&P Data for \ncontact-center services.\" (Id. at 9). Plaintiffs respond, \"[N]either Mr. Borts nor Mr. Plashkes \never saw any of that correspondence and only became aware of the details of the negotiations \nconducted with the new owner of S&P Data by virtue of the current litigation. \" (D.I. 140 at 7). I \nagree with Plaintiffs . Mr. Plashkes testified that he never saw the letter, only that McGraw Hill \nwas told to \"go away.\" (See Tr. 403:18-19, 403:25-404:3 ). Mr. Borts only learned of the \ndispute through Mr. Plashkes. (Tr. 487:15-488 :6). \nI find that Defendants had plausible reasons for adopting the name S&P Data. There is \nno evidence that Defendants intended to trade on Plaintiffs ' goodwill. Defendants did have full \nknowledge of Plaintiffs ' marks and Plaintiffs ' potential objection to the use of \"S&P\" when they \nadopted \"S&P Data.\" In short, while Defendants did not act in bad faith, they are not entirely \n14 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 14 of 37 PageID #: 3282\"blameless\" either. Kos, 369 F.3d at 721. In light of the evidence, I find this factor favors \nneither party. \nf. Evidence of Actual Confusion \nPlaintiffs argue that there is significant evidence of actual confusion. (DJ. 136 at 12-14). \nPlaintiffs point to the following incidents as evidence of actual confusion : \n\u2022 In 2014, Defendants ' executive assistant sent a Linkedln message seeking to arrange an \nintroduction call to KeyBank, a client of Plaintiffs. (PTX-78, Tr. 283:25-294:22). The \nmessage was eventually forwarded from Key Bank to one of Plaintiffs' employees . \n\u2022 In 2016, Defendants had a meeting with Discover, a potential client. Defendants \nrequested a non-disclosure agreement. (PTX-40; Tr. 444:21-445:1). Discover responded \nby producing an NDA between Discover and Plaintiffs . (See PTX-40). \n\u2022 In 2017, Defendants ' executive assistant sent emails to Steven Sikes from SoFi seeking to \nschedule a meeting between Mr. Sikes and Mr. Plashkes. (PTX-41). Mr. Sikes initially \nagreed to the meeting, but later declined the meeting, stating, \"I apologize for the about \nface, but my initial impression was that you guys were from Standard & Poor's.\" (Id.). \n\u2022 In 2017, Christy Boughman from Wells Fargo emailed sales@spdatallc.com and asked \nfor pricing on \"the S&P CDO Evaluator License.\" (PTX-43; Tr. 501 :23-502:8). [The \nS&P CDO Evaluator is one of Plaintiffs ' products.]. Defendants ' executive assistant \nresponded , \"are you trying to reach standard and poors?\" (Id.). Boughman replied, \"I am \ntrying to reach S&P Data LLC. Do you have the CDO Evaluator License?\" (Id.). \n\u2022 In 2018, a website that \"scraped\" a job listing from S&P Data included links to Standard \n& Poor's and had the S&P Global Logo. (PTX-44, 508:22-509:2). \n\u2022 In 2018, a commenter on Reddit associated the \"S&P data center\" in Cleveland , Ohio, \nwith the \"primary assets that control the countr[y's] economy. \" (PTX-49) . \n\u2022 In 2020, an attorney contacted one of Plaintiffs ' in-house counsels about a class action \ncomplaint against one of Defendants' entities. (PTX-48; Tr. 358:9-13). \n\u2022 In 2020, two individuals appear to have left job reviews for Defendants on Plaintiffs' job \nboard on Indeed. (Tr. 359:2-13). \n\u2022 Defendants' witnesses testified to some instances where individuals have asked about \nwhether Defendants are associated with Plaintiffs. (E.g., Tr. 410: 15-411: 14). \nSome of this evidence has little to no probative value. The web scraping, for instance, \nlikely reflects a computer software algorithm but does not show confusion by a person. Cf Quia \nCorp. v. Mattel, Inc., 2011 WL 2749576, at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 14, 2011) (\"[T]he mere fact that \nan internet search engine intermingles links to two products is not evidence of consumer \nconfusion.\"). Inquiries about whether Defendants have a relation to Plaintiffs \"do[] not \n15 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 15 of 37 PageID #: 3283demonstrate actual confusion. At most, it indicates that certain customers inquired as to whether \nthe companies were related.\" VeriFone , Inc. v. Poynt Co., 199 F. Supp. 3d 898, 910 (D. Del. \n2016). \nThe Reddit comment requires some assumptive leaps and is from an anonymous source. \nThe employees leaving a review on the wrong company's Indeed portfolio and the attorney who \ncontacted Plaintiffs regarding a lawsuit against Defendants might have some probative value, but \nit is hard to attribute this to actual confusion rather than inattentiveness or carelessness. See \nTherma-Scan, Inc. v. Thermoscan , Inc., 295 F.3d 623, 636 (6th Cir. 2002) (finding six emails \nsent to \"thermascan\" rather than \"thermoscan\" provided \"only weak support for finding a \nlikelihood of confusion\" because it was possible that \"the people who sent the e-mail messages . \n. . were inattentive or careless when attempting to find the e-mail address for Thermoscan, rather \nthan confused about the source of the ear thermometers\"). \nThe Discover incident appears to be an idiosyncratic event, as it was not the department \ninterfacing with Defendants that expressed confusion but rather the legal department. I give this \nsome probative value. \nThe Key Bank, SoFi, and Wells Fargo incidents are the best evidence of confusion. Each \nshows initial interest confusion. Initial interest confusion is actionable in the Third Circuit. \nCheckpoint, 269 F.3d at 294. \"The rarity of ... evidence [of actual confusion] makes even a few \nincidents highly probative of the likelihood of confusion.\" Kos, 369 F.3d at 720 (citations \nomitted). \nDefendants argue that the incidents of actual confusion did not and could not have any \neffect on the marketplace, and thus should be given no weight. The Third Circuit has held, \n\"Where confusion has little or no meaningful effect in the marketplace, it is of little or no \n16 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 16 of 37 PageID #: 3284consequence in our analysis. Nonetheless, we decline to issue a blanket rule limiting the \nprobative value of initial interest. Its significance will vary, and must be determined on a case\u00ad\nby-case basis.\" Checkpoi nt Sys., 269 F.3d at 297. \nConsidering the facts of this case, I think initial interest confusion has probative value. \nPlaintiffs' marks enjoy both conceptual and commercial strength. There is evidence of \nrecognition among the general public. \"Where strong and well-known marks are used by others, \nthe scope of protection may extend far to other product fields.\" McCarthy\u00a7 24:49. \nAccordingly, I think this factor favors Plaintiffs . \ng. Channels of Trade and Advertisement \nUnder the seventh Lapp factor, I examine \"whether the goods, competing or not \ncompeting, are marketed through the same channels of trade and advertised through the same \nmedia.\" A & H Sportswear, 237 F.3d at 215. \nDefendants have an internet presence, but mostly market through sales presentations and \nrecommendations. (Tr. 453 :6-21 ). Plaintiffs also have an internet presence and market their \nbusiness in a variety of other ways. Plaintiffs publish academic research, advertise in print, \ndigital, and radio, and host training events, among other avenues. (Tr. 44:2-47:25). \n\"Today, it would be the rare commercial retailer that did not advertise online, and the \nshared use of a ubiquitous marketing channel does not shed much light on the likelihood of \nconsumer confusion .\" Network Automation , Inc. v. Advanced Sys. Concepts, Inc., 638 F.3d \n1137, 1151 (9th Cir. 2011). Other than the internet presence, Plaintiffs have not identified \noverlapping channels of advertisement. I find this factor favors Defendants. \nh. Sales Targets \n17 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 17 of 37 PageID #: 3285T}:ie eighth Lapp factor requires me to consider \"the extent to which the targets of the \nparties' sales efforts are the same.\" A & H Sportswear , 237 F.3d at 215. Plaintiffs argue that \nthere is overlap in the financial industry, fintech, and energy sectors. (D.I. 136 at 17). \nDefendants respond that the overlap in companies that purchase services from the parties must be \nunderstood in the context of how these companies operate. (D.I. 139 at 17-18). The department \nof a business purchasing call center services will be different from the department of the same \nbusiness purchasing Plaintiffs ' finance-related services. Defendants direct their sales efforts \ntoward procurement , sales, marketing, and contact-center departments . (Tr. 456: 16-19). There \nis no evidence that Plaintiffs direct their sales efforts to these departments. There is some \nevidence, as Plaintiffs argue, that \"Defendants have directly targeted decision makers who seek \nPlaintiffs ' services.\" (D .I. 140 at 8). As discussed in the context of evidence of actual \nconfusion, a Key Bank employee forwarded Defendants ' message to Plaintiffs ' employee . The \nSoFi incident reflects a potential client who would have been willing to talk to Plaintiffs but who \ncancelled the scheduled meeting after learning it would be with Defendants. \nDefendants point to Checkpoint in support of their position. In Checkpoint , the Third \nCircuit affirmed the district court's finding that, despite some overlap in the parties' customer \nbase, this factor did not favor a finding of a likelihood of confusion . \"Even though many \ncompanies often purchase both types of products, most rely on information specialists to make \npurchasing decisions about network security systems, ... [b ]ut information specialists are not \nessential to make purchasing decisions about physical article security systems.\" 269 F.3d at 289. \nPlaintiffs point to Acxiom Corp. v. Axiom, Inc., 27 F. Supp. 2d 478, 502-03 (D. Del. \n1998) in support of their position. In Acxiom, the defendant argued that, despite overlap in the \ncustomer base, the sales targets were different because each party sold to different departments \n18 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 18 of 37 PageID #: 3286in a corporation. Id. The Acxiom court found that there was some overlap-both parties targeted \ninformation technology managers and senior management. Id. \nHere, I think this factor favors Plaintiffs. The targeted industries have some overlap. \nDefendants serve a variety of industries , one of which is the financial industry. Plaintiffs are \nfocused on the financial industry. There is evidence of confusion in the banking industry, which \nis unsurprising given the strength of Plaintiffs' marks. I think Defendants are right to point out \nthat they service different departments within a corporation , which weighs somewhat in their \nfavor. Still, there is evidence of overlapping sales targets and, accordingly, I think this factor \nfavors Plaintiffs . \ni. Relationship of the Goods in the Minds of Consumers \nThe ninth Lapp factor requires the court to consider \"the relationship of the goods in the \nminds of consumers, whether because of the near-identity of the products, the similarity of \nfunction, or other factors.\" A & H Sportswear , 237 F.3d at 215. \"The question is whether the \nconsumer might therefore reasonably conclude that one company would offer both of these \nrelated products.\" Fisons, 30 F.3d at 481. Plaintiffs and Defendants do not sell the same \nproducts or services. Plaintiffs argue that, nevertheless , \"Defendants ' services involve a business \nanalytics and consulting component that shares a functional similarity with Plaintiffs' financial \ninformation services in that both offer data-driven solutions and infrastructure to help manage \ntheir customers ' business operations more effectively and efficiently .\" (D.1. 136 at 17). This is a \nstretch. I do not think the parties' services are similar enough to seem related to consumers. An \nemphasis on data and business analytics is so generic that it is a meaningless observation. No \nmatter how sophisticated Defendants' business is, at the end of the day, Defendants operate call \ncenters. Plaintiffs provide financial data and insights to institutional investors. (Tr. 34: 19-24). \n19 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 19 of 37 PageID #: 3287Plaintiffs argue that the similarity and fame of their mark increases the likelihood of \nconfusion, despite the fact that Plaintiffs do not offer call center services. (D.I. 136 at 16-17). \n\"The greater the similarity of the marks, the lesser is the similarity required in the goods or \nservices of the parties to support a finding of likely confusion.\" McCarthy\u00a7 23:20.50 (citation \nomitted). Even so, the goods are dissimilar. I will consider how the overall strength of \nPlaintiffs' marks impacts the likelihood of confusion despite dissimilar goods and services in the \nweighing of the factors. \nThe ninth Lapp factor favors Defendants. \nj. Converging Markets \nThe tenth Lapp factor considers \"other facts suggesting that the consuming public might \nexpect the prior owner to manufacture a product in the defendant's market, or that he is likely to \nexpand into that market.\" 721 F.2d at 463. Defendants argue, \"Nothing in the record suggests \nthat the public would expect Plaintiffs to expand into telemarketing on behalf of third parties.\" \n(D.I. 139 at 20). Further, \"Ifrecent M&A activity is any indication, Plaintiffs' merger with IHS \nMarkit shows that Plaintiffs plan to go deeper, not wider, in the services they offer.\" (Id.). IHS \nMarkit tracks sales of commodities, which is one of Plaintiffs' core offerings . (Tr. 72:5-12; \n35:2-4). Defendants ' argument is logical. Plaintiffs do not respond. (See D.I. 140). \nI agree with Defendants. There is no record evidence that the consuming public might \nexpect Plaintiffs to expand into the call center business. Accordingly, this factor favors \nDefendants. \n3. Lack of Survey Evidence \nDefendants urge me to consider Plaintiffs' failure to submit survey evidence as a factor \nthat weighs against finding a likelihood of confusion. (D.I. 139 at 20). Both parties point to \n20 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 20 of 37 PageID #: 3288Charles Jacquin Et Cie, Inc. v. Destileria Serralles, Inc., 921 F.2d 467, 475-76 (3d Cir. 1990) in \nsupport of their position. In Jacquin, the Third Circuit considered whether \"the district court \nerred by refusing to instruct the jury on Jacquin's failure to conduct a consumer survey.\" Id. \nThe Court of Appeals held: \n[A] plaintiffs failure to conduct such a survey where it has the financial resources to do \nso, could lead a jury to infer that the plaintiff believes the results of the survey will be \nunfavorable. \nNevertheless , we have not yet held that a consumer survey is mandatory to establish \nlikelihood of confusion in a Lanham Act case and do not so hold in this case. While \nconsumer surveys are useful, and indeed the most direct method of demonstrating \nsecondary meaning and likelihood of confusion, they are not essential where, as here, \nother evidence exists. \nId. ( citations omitted). \nI decline to infer that a survey would have yielded unfavorable results based on Plaintiffs ' \nlack of survey evidence. Plaintiffs presented other evidence regarding likelihood of confusion , \nincluding actual instances of confusion . Plaintiffs were not required to present survey evidence \nin support of their case. \n4. Weighing of the Factors \nPlaintiffs have shown a likelihood of confusion . Plaintiffs ' and Defendants ' marks are \nstrikingly similar, which is \"[t]he single most important factor in determining likelihood of \nconfusion .\" A & H Sportswear, 237 F. 3d at 216. Plaintiffs' marks enjoy commercial and \nconceptual strength, and there is actual evidence of confusion in the industry where Plaintiffs ' \nand Defendants ' sales targets overlap. While Plaintiffs and Defendants offer different goods and \nservices, the test for noncompeting goods is likelihood of confusion as to sponsorship, affiliation \nor connection. McCarthy\u00a7 2 4:6; A & H Sportswear, 237 F. 3d at 216. Plaintiffs have shown \n21 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 21 of 37 PageID #: 3289this. There is actual evidence of confusion as to affiliation, and the rarity of such evidence \nmakes it especially probative. \nDefendants rely heavily on Checkpoint in their likelihood of confusion analysis. \nCheckpoint is highly instructive as to the likelihood of confusion when plaintiffs and defendants \ndo not compete. The Checkpoint court recognized the highly fact-specific nature of the \nlikelihood of confusion inquiry. 269 F.3d at 297. Here, there is a key factual difference \u00ad\nPlaintiffs' marks are very strong, and accordingly enjoy a broad scope of protection. \"[T]he \nstrength of the owner's mark directly affects the likelihood that consumers will be confused as to \nthe sources of products bearing substantially similar marks.\" Versa Prod., 50 F .3d at 203. The \nevidence in this case bears this out. Plaintiffs and Defendants do not compete, but there has been \nactual confusion regarding Defendants' affiliation with Plaintiffs . Plaintiffs have shown a \nlikelihood of confusion between Plaintiffs' and Defendants' marks. \nIII. STATE LAW CLAIMS \nPlaintiffs state, \"S&P's claims for infringement ofregistered marks under section 32(1) \nof the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1) (Count I), false designation of origin under section \n43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (Count II), common law unfair competition under \nDelaware law (Count IV) and deceptive trade practices under 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2532(a)(2)-(3) (Count \nV) are all governed by the same standards.\" (D.I. 136 at 3 (citing cases)). Defendants respond, \nin part, that Plaintiffs have failed to show that Delaware state law recognizes the family-of-marks \ndoctrine, which is the basis of Plaintiffs ' trademark infringement case. (D.I. 139 at 21). \nPlaintiffs offer a short reply that does not directly address this point. (See D.I. 140 at 9). \nOn this briefing, I cannot say that Delaware would recognize the family of marks \ndoctrine. Two of the three cases cited by Plaintiffs just say in a footnote that the same standards \n22 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 22 of 37 PageID #: 3290apply to state law claims. Sanofi-Aventis v. Advancis Pharm. Corp., 453 F. Supp. 2d 834, 847 \nn.2 (D. Del. 2006); Chase Manhattan Bank, USA, NA. v. Freedom Card, Inc., 333 F. Supp. 2d \n239, 244 & n.13 (D. Del. 2004). The third case compares Delaware law to the Lanham Act in a \nlikelihood of confusion analysis. Rockland Mortg. Corp. v. S'holders Funding, Inc., 835 F. \nSupp. 182, 196-97 (D. Del. 1993). It is possible that the \"same standards\" refer to the elements \nof the claim, not to doctrines such as the family of marks doctrine relied upon by Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs did not respond to Defendants ' argument. Absent a more compelling analysis, \nincluding at least some reference to Delaware caselaw, as opposed to broad statements in federal \ncases in different contexts, to argue for the correctness of Plaintiffs' position on Delaware law, I \nfind Plaintiffs have not provided a sufficient basis to find in their favor on their state law claims. \nIV. LANHAM ACT DILUTION \nA. Legal Standard \nUnder the Lanham Act, \"Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark \nthat is distinctive, inherently or through acquired distinctiveness , shall be entitled to an \ninjunction against another person who, at any time after the owner's mark has become famous, \ncommences use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring \nor dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of actual or \nlikely confusion, of competition , or of actual economic injury.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(c). \nFame is a threshold requirement for dilution. A mark is famous \"if it is widely \nrecognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source of the \ngoods or services of the mark's owner.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 l 125(c)(2)(A). A court may consider (1) \n\"[t]he duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the mark\"; (2) \"[t]he \n23 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 23 of 37 PageID #: 3291amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark\"; (3) \n\"(t]he extent of actual recognition of the mark\"; and (4) \"[w]hether the mark was registered. \" Id. \nB. Findings of Fact \n1. Defendant s first used \"S&P Data\" in commerc e in 2004. \n2. Plaintiffs have used \"S&P\" in commerce since the 1940s. Plaintiffs ' marks were the \nsubject of publicity in national sources from at least 1979. \n3. The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales under Plaintiffs ' marks prior to 2004 \ncannot be determined . \n4. The extent of actual recognition of Plaintiffs ' marks prior to 2004 cannot be determined. \n5. Some of Plaintiffs ' marks were federally registered before 2004. \n6. Plaintiffs have failed to show that their marks were famous prior to Defendants ' use of its \nmark in commerce . \nA. Discussion \nFor injunctive relief under the dilution statute, a plaintiff must prove that its mark was \nfamous before the defendant started using its mark in commerce. See 15 U.S.C. 1125(c). \nPlaintiffs suggest, in a footnote, that fame should be measured as of 2014, when Defendants first \nused \"S&P\" on their website. (See D.I. 136 at 20 n.4). Defendants respond that Defendants first \nused the mark in commerce , as defined by the Lanham Act, from 2004. (D.I. 139 at 23). I agree \nwith Defendants. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 provides, \"For the purposes of this chapter, a mark shall be \ndeemed to be in use in commerce ... on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or \nadvertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce .... \" Defendants have \npresented evidence that a sales presentation in use from 2004 to 2006 and the \"standard \nconsulting agreement \" in 2004 used the \"S&P Data\" name. (Tr. 484:6-8, 489:20-23; DTX23; \n24 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 24 of 37 PageID #: 3292DTX-179; DTX-16). Accordingly , I find that Defendants used the mark in commerce from \n2004. \nPlaintiffs ' evidence of fame includes advertising spend, media coverage , revenue, federal \ntrademark registrations , and the Poret survey. (D.I. 136 at 20-23). Much of Plaintiffs' evidence, \nhowever, comes from after 2004. For the following reasons, I think the pre-2004 evidence fails \nto meet the \"rigorous standard\" required to prove fame under the dilution statute. See Coach \nServs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1374-76 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming the \nTrademark Trial and Appeal Board's finding that Coach failed to provide sufficient evidence \nshowing fame prior to the defendant's trademark registration filing). \nFor the first two factors, Plaintiffs have some evidence of advertising and revenues from \nbefore 2004. In 2001 and 2002, Plaintiffs (meaning McGraw-Hill) spent $107 million and $92 \nmillion on advertising and reported $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion in revenue, respectively. (PTX-\n104). Defendants point out that these are aggregate figures not broken down by business, region, \ncountry, or mark. (Tr. 83:18-84:1). Prior to 2013, McGraw Hill had education, construction, \nand aviation businesses as well as the S&P business. (Tr. 56:10-12). Accordingly , I do not \nthink these figures are probative of the extent to which advertising and revenues prior to 2004 are \nattributable to the asserted marks. \nThere is other evidence that supports the first factor. Plaintiffs used S&P in commerce \nfrom the 1940s. (Tr. 34: 1-11 ). Plaintiffs gained attention in national news sources such as the \nWall Street Journal, the New York Times, and USA Today from 1979. (PTX-122) . Plaintiffs \nhave submitted over a dozen articles from before 2004. (See id.). \nThe first two factors are \"not necessarily as strong as factor three,\" since \"they require the \ncourt to infer that advertising and sales have an impact on the 'general consuming public' and \n25 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 25 of 37 PageID #: 3293make the brand famous.\" Steak Umm Co. v. Steak'Em Up, Inc., 2011 WL 3679155, at *8 (E.D. \nPa. Aug. 23, 2011). \nFor the third factor, actual recognition , Plaintiffs rely heavily upon a survey conducted by \nHal Poret. The survey showed that 67% of the general consuming public was aware of the S&P \nmark in the financial industry. (Tr. 149:9-13, 151:10-15; PTX-161). The survey asked a single, \n\"aided recognition \" question: whether the participants had seen or heard of a series of eight \nnames used by any company or organization in the financial industry. (Tr. 153:21-24; PTX-\n159). \nDefendants argue that the Poret survey is not probative of fame because it was conducted \nin 2021, seventeen years after Defendants started using S&P Data in the United States. (D.I. 139 \nat 24; Tr. 180:13-23). Fame surveys conducted for litigation can be probative of fame from an \nearlier date. See Empress Cubana Del Tabaco v. Cu/bro Corp., 70 U.S.P.Q.2d 1650, 1680 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (\"The absence of any consumer studies from the relevant period necessitates \nmaking inferences from surveys conducted both beforehand and afterward. \"), aff'd in part and \nreversed in part on other grounds , 399 F.3d 462 (2d Cir. 2005). When a great deal of time has \nelapsed between the relevant time period and the survey, however, the probative value of the \nsurvey decreases. In this case, I think the probative value is low. Many things can and did \nchange in seventeen years. The 67% recognition rate is already below what the leading \ncommentator recommends ought to be the threshold for a finding of fame. McCarthy\u00a7 24:106 \n(\"[A] minimum threshold survey response should be in the range of 75% of the general \nconsuming public of the United States.\"). Based on the evidence , there is little reason to think \nthat brand recognition seventeen years ago was as good or better than the already-marginal 67% \nrecognition rate. \n26 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 26 of 37 PageID #: 3294Plaintiffs also cite internal market research and third-party brand valuation reports as \nevidence of fame. This evidence comes from 2016 or later, however, and thus also has low \nprobative value for showing fame before 2004. (E.g., PTX-111 ). \nThe fourth factor, registration , does not seem to help Plaintiffs in this case. This factor \n\"is only persuasive on its own if used to show that a mark is not famous.\" Steak Umm Co., 2011 \nWL 3679155, at *8. As McCarthy explains, \"one could logically infer lack of fame from a lack \nof registration, reasoning that if the owner of an allegedly 'famous' mark did not even bother to \ntake the commercially ordinary and minimal step of federally registering the mark, this is an \nadmission against interest that the mark is not 'famous.\"' \u00a7 24:106. As of 2004, only S&P 100, \nS&P 500, and S&P 1000 were registered. \"S&P\" itself was not registered until 2009. (PTX-091 \nat P-1076). Given Plaintiffs ' longstanding use of S&P, however, and the three federal \nregistrations on the books as of 2004, I decline to draw the negative inference against Plaintiffs. \nSuffice it to say, however, that this factor does not provide much support for Plaintiffs ' position. \nThe Trademark Dilution Revision Act (\"TDRA\") amended the dilution statute in 2006. \n\"One of the major purposes of the TDRA was to restrict dilution causes of action to those few \ntruly famous marks like Budweiser beer, Camel cigarettes, Barbie Dolls, and the like.\" Bd of \nRegents, Univ. ofTex. Sys. v. KST Elec., Ltd, 550 F. Supp. 2d 657, 679 (W.D. Tex. 2008) \n(cleaned up). \"As one academic commentator put it, the 'TDRA is simply not intended to \nprotect trademarks whose fame is at all in doubt.\"' Id ( citing Barton Beebe, A Defense of the \nNew Federal Trademark Antidilution Law, 16 FORDHAM INTELL. PROP. MEDIA & ENT. \nL.J. 1143, 1158 (2006)). In this case, Plaintiffs' evidence of fame around 2004 or earlier is \nlacking. \nV. DELAWARE ANTIDILUTION STATUTE \n27 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 27 of 37 PageID #: 3295A. Legal Standard \n6 Del. C. \u00a7 3313 provides, \"Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of \nthe distinctive quality of a mark registered under this chapter, or a mark valid at common law or \na trade name valid at common law, shall be a ground for injunctive relief notwithstanding the \nabsence of competition between the parties, or the absence of confusion as to the source of goods \nor services.\" A plaintiff's mark need not be famous to obtain relief under the Delaware statute; \nrather, proof of distinctiveness suffices. See Barnes Grp. Inc. v. Connell Ltd. P'ship, 793 F. \nSupp. 1277, 1304 (D. Del. 1992). A plaintiff must also show some mental association between \nthe marks. See id. \nB. Findings of Fact \n1. Plaintiffs ' marks are inherently distinctive. \n2. Plaintiffs ' and Defendants ' marks are similar. \n3. Plaintiffs are engaging in substantially exclusive use of their marks. \n4. Plaintiffs' \"S&P\" mark has a high degree of recognition among the general public. \n5. Defendants did not adopt their mark with the intent to create an association with \nPlaintiffs ' marks. \n6. There are several instances of actual association between the marks. \n7. There is mental association between Plaintiffs ' and Defendants ' marks. \n8. Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of dilution under the Delaware Antidilution statute. \nC. Discussion \nPlaintiffs' marks are inherently distinctive , and thus qualify for protection under the \nDelaware Antidilution Statute. \n28 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 28 of 37 PageID #: 3296Plaintiffs have also shown mental association between the marks. Few courts have \napplied the Delaware Antidilution Statute, and the test for mental association is not entirely clear. \nSee Spark Therapeutics , Inc. v. bluebird bio, Inc., 2022 WL 605724, at* 13 (D. Del. Jan. 25, \n2022). The Spark court considered the federal dilution factors, which are \"similar to factors \nadopted by courts in analyzing state anti-dilution statutes.\" Id. at* 17. The federal dilution \nfactors are: \n(i) The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark. \n(ii) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark. \n(iii) The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially \nexclusive use of the mark. \n(iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark. \n(v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the \nfamous mark. \n(vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark. \n15 U.S.C. 1125(c)(2)(B) . I think the federal dilution factors are helpful in assessing whether \nthere is some mental association between the marks, and therefore will consider the evidence \nPlaintiffs presented for their Lanham Act claim of dilution by blurring. \nAs I found with regard to likelihood of confusion , the first and second factors favor \nPlaintiffs. \nThe third factor, the extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in \nsubstantially exclusive use of the mark, favors Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs ' marks are federally \nregistered. (Tr. 335:11-13) . Plaintiffs have enforced their trademark rights over many years \nthrough litigation, demand letters, and trademark oppositions at the Trademark Trial and Appeal \nBoard. (Tr. 339:2-352:9) . \nThe fourth factor, the degree of recognition of Plaintiffs ' mark, favors Plaintiffs. Here, I \nthink the Poret survey has a much stronger probative value. The Delaware antidilution statute \ndoes not have the same temporal requirement as the federal antidilution statute. The Poret \n29 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 29 of 37 PageID #: 3297survey is 2021 evidence offered to show the degree of recognition in 2021. Accordingly , the \nsurvey' s finding of a 67% level of recognition suggests a high degree of recognition of Plaintiffs ' \nmark. \nThe fifth factor, whether Defendants used Plaintiffs ' mark with the intent to create an \nassociation with Plaintiffs' mark, favors Defendants . As discussed above, while Defendants \nknew about Plaintiffs ' mark, there is no evidence that Defendants chose S&P to freeride on \nPlaintiffs' name recognition. \nThe sixth factor, actual association between the marks, favors Plaintiffs. As discussed in \nthe context of likelihood of confusion , there is evidence of actual confusion. Some of Plaintiffs ' \nexamples of confusion have more force in the dilution context because they show association \nbetween the marks even if they do not show confusion. The website scraping, for instance, \nassociated Plaintiffs' and Defendants' marks. Accordingly, I find this factor favors Plaintiffs. \nFive out of six dilution factors favor Plaintiffs . Weighing the evidence, it seems likely \nthat there is mental association between Plaintiffs' and Defendants ' marks. This association is \nmost powerfully shown through evidence of actual confusion, but the marks' distinctiveness, \nsimilarity , exclusivity , and degree of recognition all favor finding a likelihood of dilution by \nblurring. Accordingly , I find that Plaintiffs have shown dilution by blurring under the Delaware \nAntidilution Statute. \nVI. LACHES \nA. LegalStandard \nLachesis an affirmative defense with two elements : (1) inexcusable delay in initiating \nsuit and (2) prejudice to the defendant from the delay. See Univ. of Pittsburgh v. Champion \nProds. Inc., 686 F.2d 1040, 1044 (3d Cir. 1982). Delay is assessed based on the most analogous \n30 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 30 of 37 PageID #: 3298statute oflimitations . Kars 4 Kids Inc. v. Am. Can!, 8 F. 4th 209, 220 (3d Cir. 2021). If the \nlimitations period has expired, there is a presumption of laches. Id. at 221. A plaintiff can rebut \nthis presumption by showing that the delay was excusable and did not prejudice the defendant . \nId. \nIn Delaware , the statute of limitations on analogous state claims is three years. Sanofi\u00ad\nAventis, 453 F. Supp. 2d at 855-56. Here, Plaintiffs admit that, because Plaintiffs first learned of \nDefendants' use in 2014, they bear the burden ofrebutting the presumption oflaches. (D.I. 136 \nat 29). \nB. Findings of Fact \n1. Plaintiffs ' delay in initiating suit is excusable due to the changing nature of Defendants ' \nuse of Defendants ' mark. \n2. Defendants have not suffered evidentiary prejudice due to the delay. \n3. Defendants have not suffered economic prejudice due to the delay. \n4. Plaintiffs have rebutted the presumption of laches. \nC. Discussion \nPlaintiffs seek only injunctive relief. \"[T]he doctrine [ of laches] is sparingly applied \nwhere . . . a plaintiff seeks only equitable relief.\" Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 81 F .3d \n455,461 (4th Cir. 1996). \"Only 'outrageous , unreasonable , and inexcusable delay' bars all \nclaims for relief; less egregious delay bars claims for past infringement , not for prospective \ninjunctive relief.\" Sanofi-Aventis, 453 F. Supp. 2d at 856 (quoting Univ. of Pittsburgh, 686 F.2d \nat 1044). \nI find that the equities in this case favor granting an injunction. Plaintiffs ' delay was not \nso outrageous and unreasonable as to bar their claim for injunctive relief. The relevant period of \n31 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 31 of 37 PageID #: 3299delay is 2014 to 2019, when the parties began settlement negotiations. (Tr. 363:18-23). \"Time \nspent in attempting to resolve a dispute is not counted towards laches because [ s ]ettlement of \nlegal disputes is a highly favored course of conduct for which a party should be rewarded , not \npenalized.\" McCarthy \u00a7 31: 15 ( citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, Plaintiffs \ndelayed only two years beyond the statutory period. \nPlaintiffs argue that the delay is excused under the progressive encroachment doctrine. \n(D.I. 136 at 30). While the Third Circuit has not explicitly recognized the doctrine, in University \nof Pittsburgh , the Court found that a substantial change in the \"character and scope\" of \ninfringement supported a finding that there was not unreasonable delay. 686 F. 2d at 1046. In \nthat case, the defendant 's activities expanded from \"from a modest program of [merchandise] \nsales to students and local adherents of the university to a program of national sales aimed at \nservicing and capitalizing upon Pitt's emergence as a national college football power.\" Id. Here, \nDefendants' encroachment is not as stark. There is, however, evidence that Defendants made a \nconcerted effort to unify their advertising and marketing around \"S&P Data\" rather than \"SP \nData\" between 2014 and 2019. I think that this, combined with the relatively short period of \ndelay, makes Plaintiffs' delay excusable. \nIn this case, the earliest evidence of confusion-the 2014 KeyBank incident-supports \nthe inference that Defendants were still using \"SP Data\" fairly prominently when Defendants ' \nuse of the mark first came to Plaintiffs ' attention. After Defendants' executive assistant reached \nout to Key Bank, the message was forwarded to one of Plaintiffs ' employees , Laura Albert. \n(PTX-78; Tr. 284:25-285 :14, 287:13-22). Ms. Albert forwarded the message to her manager \nwith the note, \"Can you please take a look at the below? They are trying to represent S&P and \nare in fact SP Data.\" (Id.). Ms. Albert testified that she did not remember why she said that \n32 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 32 of 37 PageID #: 3300Defendants \"are in fact SP Data\" at the time but speculated that she did some research upon \nsensing that her client-Key Bank-was confused. (Tr. 291 :6-13, 293:24-294:9). I credit Ms. \nAlbert's testimony on the steps she likely took upon receiving the Key Bank message. In light of \nDefendants ' mixed use of \"SP Data\" and \"S&P Data\" during the relevant time period, it seems \nlikely that Ms. Albert encountered materials referring to Defendants as \"SP Data.\" (See PTX-88; \nTr. 489:1-16). \nAfter Plaintiffs first became aware of Defendants ' use of \"S&P,\" Defendants became \nmore intentional about branding . Around 2014, Defendants made the effort to identify solely as \n\"S&P Data.\" (Tr. 467:20-22). In 2015, Defendants hired a consultant who identified branding \nas a weakness for the company. (Tr. 297:21-298:25; 300:11-17). That same year, they \ndeveloped a new logo that increased the prominence of the ampersand and \"S&P:\" \nD TA\u007f \u007f \nOld logo. (PTX-66; Tr. 312:8-313:22) New logo. (PTX-68; Tr. 313:23-314:1) \nThe new logo features \"S&P\" more prominently. The evidence suggests that Defendants ' use of \n\"SP Data\" has tapered off in recent years. In this light, it seems reasonable that Plaintiffs did not \nimmediately file suit or take other action in 2014. \nI also think that there was no prejudice to Defendants. Defendants assert both \nevidentiary prejudice and economic prejudice. For evidentiary prejudice, Defendants argue that \nthe delay deprived Defendants of the opportunity to conduct a recognition survey to show \nPlaintiffs' lack of fame as of 2004. While a fame survey closer in time to relevant period would \nhave more probative value, it is difficult to say that a survey conducted in, say, 2016, would have \n33 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 33 of 37 PageID #: 3301much more probative value than one conducted in 2021. At any rate, Plaintiffs have not met \ntheir burden of showing fame and Defendants have not been prejudiced in that regard. \nDefendants also point to McGraw-Hill 's late-1990s opposition to the Canadian \ncompany's \"S&P Data\" registration. (D.I. 139 at 35). Defendant s assert that additional \ndocuments might have been found, and the testimony of S&P Data's outside counsel, who died \nin 2016, could have been taken. The Canadian registration dispute is relevant to Defendants ' \nknowledge of Plaintiffs ' mark. Plaintiffs have used it to argue bad faith based on Defendants ' \nselection of \"S&P\" despite knowing about McGraw Hill's previous opposition to it. Given that \nMr. Plashkes was not personall y involved in the matter, however, it is difficult to see how more \ndetails regarding the incident would help Defendant s. \nAccordingly , there is no substantial evidentiary prejudice. \nRegarding economic prejudice , Plaintiffs argue, \"The mere fact that Defendants \nexpanded their business after 2014 does not constitute economic prejudice. \" (D.I. 136 at 36). I \nagree. Defendants point to increased spending on advertising and opening new facilities under \nthe S&P Data name. (D.I. 139 at 36). \"If ... prejudice could consist merely of expenditures in \npromoting the infringed name, then relief would have to be denied in practicall y every case of \ndelay.\" Tisch Hotels, Inc. v. Americana Inn, Inc., 350 F.2d 609,615 (7th Cir. 1965). Rather, \neconomic prejudice occurs when the defendant has \"buil[t] up innocently an important reliance \non the publicity of his mark[] so that its loss would cost dearly. \" Chandon Champagne Corp. v. \nSan Marino Wine Corp., 335 F.2d 531, 535 (2d Cir. 1964); see also Univ. of Pittsburgh, 686 \nF.2d at 1045 (noting that laches gives \"rise to affirmative rights in the defendant as a result of \ndetrimental reliance\"). \n34 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 34 of 37 PageID #: 3302Here, the evidence does not reflect Defendants ' reliance upon the publicity of \"S&P \nData.\" As discussed with regard to likelihood of confusion, Defendants ' sales process is long \nand personalized. Sales are primarily \"founder-led[,] developed through relationships ... with \nformer clients.\" (Tr. 453:8-12). As Mr. Borts, Defendants' principal, testified, \"I mean, listen. \nPeople don't wake up in the morning and think, oh, I'm going to call S&P Data for call center \nservices.\" (Tr. 516:14-16). \nThe opening of additional call centers under the \"S&P Data\" banner similarly does not \nshow prejudice to Defendants. The call centers are not retail stores that attract the general \npublic. Call center employees only disclose Defendants ' name when required to by state law. \nWhere required by state law, they state that they are calling from S&P Data on behalf of \nDefendants ' clients. (Tr. 459:25-460:9 (\"Hi. This is David Borts from S&P Data calling on \nbehalf of T-Mobile.\")). \nPlaintiffs have rebutted a presumption of laches. Plaintiffs ' delay was reasonable and \nDefendants did not encounter material prejudice . \nVII. RELIEF \nPlaintiffs seek a permanent injunction . \"According to well-established principles of \nequity, a plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must ... demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered \nan irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \ninadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between \nthe plaintiff and defendant , a remedy in equity is warranted; and ( 4) that the public interest \nwould not be disserved by a permanent injunction. \" eBay Inc. v. MercExchange , L.L.C., 547 \nU.S. 388, 391 (2006). \n\"The law of trademark protects trademark owners in the exclusive use of their marks \nwhen use by another would be likely to cause confusion. \" Citizens Fin. Grp., Inc. v. Citizens \n35 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 35 of 37 PageID #: 3303Nat. Bank of Evans City, 383 F.3d 110, 131 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing Lapp, 721 F. 2d at 462). \"A \npermanent injunction is the usual and normal remedy once trademark infringement has been \nfound in a final judgment. \" McCarthy \u00a7 30.1. \nUnder 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116(a), a \"plaintiff seeking any such injunction shall be entitled to a \nrebuttable presumption of irreparable harm upon a finding of a violation identified in this \nsubsection in the case of a motion for a permanent injunction. \" Since I have found a violation of \nthe Lanham Act, the presumption applies. Defendants argue that this presumption is rebutted \nbecause of Plaintiffs ' delay. (D.I. 139 at 39 (citing Harley's Hope Found. v. Harleys Dream, \n2022 WL 1154526, at *3 (D. Colo. Apr. 19, 2022)). I do not think the delay in this case rebuts \nthe presumption because, as I have found, Plaintiffs ' delay was excusable. \nThe other eBay factors also favor Plaintiffs. Remedies available at law would not be able \nto compensate Plaintiffs for their loss of control over their reputation. (Tr. 364:9-25); see \nAAMCO Transmissions , Inc. v. Dunlap, 646 F. App'x 182, 183 (3d Cir. 2016). Defendants ' \nhardships are not so great where, as discussed above, there is little evidence of economic harm \nand Defendants used the name \"SP Data\" interchangeably for many years. 1 Finally, the public \ninterest would be served by a permanent injunction by preventing consumer confusion. \nAccordingly , I will grant Plaintiffs ' requested relief of a permanent injunction. 2 \nVIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, I find that Plaintiffs have proven Counts I, II, and VI by \nshowing trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), false designation of origin under 15 \n1 Plaintiffs do not take issue with \"SP Data.\" (D.I. 135 at 7:11-16; D.I. 136 at 39 (describing \n\"Defendants ' original SP Data name\" as available)). \n2 I do not need separately to consider injunctive relief pursuant to the Delaware statute, 6 Del. C. \n\u00a7 3313. \n36 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 36 of 37 PageID #: 3304U.S.C. \u00a7 l 125(a), and trademark dilution under 6 Del. C. \u00a7 3313. I will grant Plaintiffs' \nrequested relief of a permanent injunction. \nThe parties are instructed to meet and confer about how to proceed from this point. The \nparties are asked to submit a joint status report within one week, preferably with a jointly \nproposed final judgment and permanent injunction. \n37 Case 1:20-cv-00701-RGA   Document 141   Filed 08/04/22   Page 37 of 37 PageID #: 3305"}
