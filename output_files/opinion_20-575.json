No. 20-575-MN\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND \u2018\nILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC., )\nDefendants. ;\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 26th day of April, 2022, the court having considered the letter\nsubmissions regarding the motion to compel filed by defendants Ford Motor Company (\u201cFord\u201d)\nand Illinois Tool Works Inc. (\u201cITW;\u201d collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) (D.I. 69; D.I. 70), as well as\nthe in camera production made by plaintiff Stephen Eisenmann (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cMr.\nEisenmann\u201d), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants\u2019 motion to compel is GRANTED-IN-\nPART for the following reasons:\n\n1. Background. On April 28, 2020, Mr. Eisenmann filed this suit alleging that\nDefendants\u2019 diesel fuel nozzle restrictor infringes at least claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 6,302,169\n(\u201cthe \u2019169 patent\u201d), which issued in 2001 to inventor Peter Pulos.\n\n2. In March 2011, Mr. Pulos sent Ford a cease and desist letter regarding its alleged\ninfringement of the \u2019169 patent. (D.I. 69, Ex. J at ff] 20-21) In response to the letter, Ford filed a\nlawsuit in the Eastern District of Michigan seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement\nof the \u2019169 patent. (/d at 4931-34) The litigation settled in April 2012. (/d., Ex. K)\n\n3. Mr. Pulos assigned his rights to the \u2019169 patent to his attorney, Mr. Eisenmann,\n\npursuant to an assignment agreement executed on December 7, 2019. (D.I. 69, Ex. L) Mr. Pulos\nand Mr. Eisenmann subsequently executed a \u201cconfirmation agreement\u201d in October 2021\npertaining to the assignment of the \u2019169 patent. (D.I. 69, Ex. O) Both the assignment agreement\nand the confirmation agreement have been produced.\n\n4. Mr. Eisenmann, as the assignee, filed the instant suit against Defendants for\ninfringement of the \u2019169 patent in April 2020. (D.I. 1) Mr. Eisenmann subsequently sought\nadmission pro hac vice in this matter, but the court entered an order disqualifying him from\nrepresenting himself in this case due to the likelihood that he would be a necessary witness. (D.I.\n36 at 3)\n\n5. On March 18, 2022, Mr. Eisenmann produced an amended privilege log which\nconfirms that Mr. Eisenmann continues to withhold as privileged certain communications with\nMr. Pulos regarding the assignment of the \u2019169 patent. (D.I. 69, Ex. D) The privilege log was\nfurther amended on March 25, 2022 (\u201cVersion 3\u201d), and that is the operative privilege log for\npurposes of this dispute. (/d., Ex. A)\n\n6. Legal Standard. \u201cThe burden of justifying the refusal to produce documents on\nthe basis of privilege falls on the party asserting the privilege.\u201d See Reckitt Benckiser Pharms.\nInc. v. Dr. Reddy\u2019s Labs. SA, C.A. No. 14-1451-RGA et al., 2016 WL 11694169, at *1 (D. Del.\nNov. 4, 2016). To meet this burden, the party asserting the privilege must show: \u201c(1) a\ncommunication (2) made between privileged persons (3) in confidence (4) for the purpose of\nobtaining or providing legal assistance for the client.\u201d Elm 3DS Innovations, LLC v. Samsung\nElecs. Co., Ltd., C.A. No. 14-1430-LPS-JLH, 2021 WL 4819904, at *1 (D. Del. Oct. 15, 2021)\n(quoting In re Grand Jury, 705 F.3d 133, 160 (3d Cir. 2012)). When the communication\n\u201cprimarily relates to business concerns\u2014as opposed to legal advice\u2014the communication is not\n\nwithin the scope of attorney-client privilege.\u201d Jd. (quoting Immersion Corp. v. HTC Corp., C.A.\nNo. 12-259-RGA, 2014 WL 3948021, at *1 (D. Del. Aug. 7, 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\n7. Analysis. Defendants\u2019 motion to compel the production of Documents 62 to 68\nand 73 on the amended privilege log is GRANTED because the attorney-client privilege does not\nextend to these documents. The assignment agreement contains a clause confirming that neither\nMr. Eisenmann nor his firm represent Mr. Pulos or his legal interests in the assignment\ntransaction and cannot provide legal advice to Mr. Pulos regarding the assignment. (D.I. 69, Ex.\nLat 3) This language confirms that Mr. Pulos and Mr. Eisenmann stood on opposite sides of the\ntable in their communications leading up to assignment transaction, and their communications\nrelate to business concerns outside the scope of the attorney-client privilege. See Immersion\nCorp., 2014 WL 3948021, at *1 (\u201cWhen the communication . . . primarily relates to business\nconcerns, the communication is not within the scope of attorney-client privilege.\u201d).\n\n8. The court\u2019s September 30, 2021 Memorandum Order reinforces the distinction\nbetween Plaintiff's role as Mr. Pulos\u2019 counsel and his role as the assignee of the \u2019169 patent.\n(D.I. 36) There, the court concluded that the assignment of the \u2019169 patent to Plaintiff prevented\nPlaintiff from providing legal counsel in this litigation. (/d. at 3) Specifically, the court found\nthat Plaintiff was likely to be a necessary fact witness in his role as the assignee of the ?169\nPatent, which gave him \u201cunique knowledge of the Patent\u2019s value\u201d and experience on the issues\nof infringement, validity, and damages. (Jd.) The court\u2019s in camera review of the challenged\ncommunications confirms that those documents relate to certain terms and execution of the\nassignment and confirmation agreements, which are already in the discovery record. Moreover,\nthe documents are responsive to Defendants\u2019 Requests for Production Nos. 4-6 and are relevant\n\nto the issue of damages. (D.I. 69, Ex. M at 6)\n9. Plaintiff suggests that the communications regarding the patent acquisition are\nprivileged under the common interest privilege. (D.I. 70 at 2) However, Plaintiff's privilege log\nasserts only the attorney-client and work product privileges with respect to these documents.\n(DI. 69, Ex. A at 7-8) Regardless, Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that he and Mr.\nPulos were \u201callied in a common legal cause\u201d in assigning the \u2019169 patent, or that the\ncommunications \u201cwould not have been made but for the sake of securing, advancing, or\nsupplying legal representation.\u201d AgroFresh Inc. v. Essentiv LLC, C.A. No. 16-662-MN, 2019\nWL 4917894, at *2 (D. Del. Oct. 4, 2019) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Plaintiff\nand Mr. Pulos were necessarily on opposite sides of the table in transferring the rights to the \u2019169\npatent for the reasons set forth at 7-8, supra.\n\n10. Having determined that the attorney-client privilege does not apply to\nDocuments 62 to 68 and 73, the court need not reach the parties\u2019 arguments regarding any\npurported waiver of the privilege.\n\n11. Defendants\u2019 motion to compel a more detailed description and/or the production\nof Documents 10 and 11 is DENIED. The court\u2019s in camera review of these communications\nconfirms that they are not related to the assignment agreement or the confirmation agreement,\nand the description of the documents in the amended privilege log is adequate. (D.I. 69, Ex. A)\n\n12. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, IT IS ORDERED that Defendants\u2019\nmotion to compel is GRANTED with respect to Documents 62 to 68 and 73 on the privilege log.\nPlaintiff shall produce the communications identified as Documents 62 to 68 and 73 after the\nexpiration of the objections period in Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) and the resolution of objections, if\nany, by the District Judge. Defendants\u2019 motion to compel a more detailed description and/or the\n\nproduction of Documents 10 to 11 on the privilege log is DENIED.\n13. Given that the court has relied upon material that technically remains under seal,\nthe court is releasing this Memorandum Order under seal, pending review by the parties. In the\nunlikely event that the parties believe that certain material in this Memorandum Opinion should\nbe redacted, the parties shall jointly submit a proposed redacted version by no later than May 3,\n2022, for review by the court, along with a motion supported by a declaration that includes a\nclear, factually detailed explanation as to why disclosure of any proposed redacted material\nwould \u201cwork a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure.\u201d See In re\nAvandia Mktg., Sales Practices & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting\nMiller v. Ind. Hosp., 16 F.3d 549, 551 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)). If the\nparties do not file a proposed redacted version and corresponding motion, or if the court\ndetermines the motion lacks a meritorious basis, the documents will be unsealed within thirty\n(30) days of the date the Memorandum Order issued.\n\n14. This Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written\nobjections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Order.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to four (4) pages\neach.\n\n15. The parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nwww.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\n"}
