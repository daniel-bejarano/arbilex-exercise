No. 21-332-LPS\n\nDELAWARE STATE FIRE PREVENTION:\nCOMMISSION, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nNatalie Lynn Nasatka, Smyrna, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 28, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\u2018AgAl (LA\n\nSTARK, U.S. Circuit Judge:\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Natalie Lynn Nasatka (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) filed this action on March 4, 2021. (D.I. 2) She\nappeats pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 5) Plaintiff moves for e-\nfiling rights. (D.I. 4) The Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b).\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiff alleges that she was notified by David\nTruax (\u201cTruax\u201d), an investigator for Defendant Delaware Fire Prevention Commission (\u201cDFPC\u201d),\nthat the Odessa Fire Company had sent her a complaint about Plaintiff's actions as an EMT. (D.I. 2\nat 4) At the time, Plaintiff was in EMT field training at Delaware Technical Community College\n(\u201cDel. Tech.\u201d) with a field trainer with Kent County Emergency Services (\u201cEMS\u201d). (Id) Truax\nadvised the EMS Chief of the investigation; the Chief then asked Del. Tech. not to schedule\nPlaintiffs training until after the conclusion of the investigation. (Id. at 5)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Truax\u2019s telephone call led to her possible suspension or expulsion from\nthe EMT course. (Id.) The matter was referred to the Delaware Department of Justice, settled, and\nformally closed on May 19, 2020. (Id.) Plaintiff surrendered her state EMT license and promised\nnever to apply for a Delaware EMT license. (Id.)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that the foregoing actions were detrimental to her paramedic education and\nshe is behind the classmates with whom she had started. (Jd. at 7) Plaintiff \u201clost faith in the\nCommission and the Delaware Department of Justice for their inconsistencies in applying their own\nrules for investigations and consequences for breaking their rules such as the Delaware State Code.\u201d\n\n1\n(Id) Plaintiff seeks $100,000 in compensatory damages. (Id.) She also moves for e-filing rights.\nML 4)\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action swa sponte under the screening provisions of\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d\nBall v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a\ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a prv se plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because\nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully\npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d\nEnickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley v.\nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 Gd\nCir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal\ntheory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957\nF.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See\nTourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or\nclaims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint, unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson, 293 F.3d at 114.\n\n2\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Be/f_Arl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nUS. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do\nmore than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a\ncause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to\nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Wiliams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306,\n315 3d Cir. 2014) (citing Asheroft \u00bb. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).\nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See\nJohnson v, City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect\nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the\nelements the plaintiff must pled to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no\nmore than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) assume the veracity of\nany well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine whether those allegations plausibly give rise\nto an entitlement to relief. See Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) Ginternal\ncitations and quotations omitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint\n\u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing\n\ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nBoth Defendants are immune from suit. Delaware Department of Justice is an agency of the\nState of Delaware and the Delaware State Fire Prevention Commission is a public body that\noversees the operation of the Delaware State Fire Marshal\u2019s Office. See 16 Del C. \u00a7 6602. The\nEleventh Amendment protects states and their agencies and departments from suit in federal court\nregardless of the kind of relief sought. See Pennhurst State School &* Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n100 (1984). \u201cAbsent a state\u2019s consent, the Eleventh Amendment bars a civil rights suit in federal\ncourt that names the state as a defendant.\u201d Laskaris \u00bb. Thornburgh, 661 F.2d 23, 25 (3d Cir. 1981)\n(citing Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781 (1978)). Delaware has not waived its immunity from suit in\nfederal court; although Congress can abrogate a state\u2019s sovereign immunity, it did not do so through\nthe enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Brooks-McCollum v. Delaware, 213 F. App\u2019x 92, 94 (3d Cir.\n2007). In addition, dismissal is proper because neither Defendant is a person for purposes of\n\u00a7 1983. See Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989); Calhoun v. Young, 288 F. App\u2019x\n47 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the Complaint as Defendants are immune from suit and\nnot persons as required to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Amendment is futile.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as moot Plaintiff's motion for e-filing rights\n(D.L 4); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@ and (iii).\nAmendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\u2018IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nNATALIE LYNN NASATKA,\nPlaintiff,\nv. + Cir. No. 21-332-LPS\n\nDELAWARE STATE FIRE PREVENTION:\nCOMMISSION, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nORDER\nAt Wilmington, this 28th day of March, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1, Plaintiff's motion for e-filing rights is DENIED as moot. (D.L. 4)\n2. The Complaint is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@ and (iii).\nAmendment is futile.\n\n3.
