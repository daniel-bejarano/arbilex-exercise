(D.I. 25) For the following reasons, I\nrecommend that Defendant\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\ni. BACKGROUND\nA. Procedural History\nPatricia Roadarmel, (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), brings this action individually, as the surviving spouse\nof Mark R. Roadarmel, (\u201cRoadarmel\u201d or \u201cDecedent\u201d), and as administratrix of his estate. (D.I.\n\n1, Ex. 1 at $1) On April 28, 2020, Plaintiff filed this personal injury action against Defendant in\n\n| The briefing for the present Motion is as follows: Defendant\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 26),\nPlaintiff's response brief (D.I. 29), and Defendant\u2019s reply brief (D.I. 30).\nthe Superior Court of Delaware, asserting claims arising from Roadarmel\u2019s death on February\n15, 2019, due to his alleged exposure to asbestos while serving in the U.S. Navy. (Jd. at J 4)\n\nOn October 9, 2020, Defendant removed the case to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1442, the federal officer removal statute.? (D.I. 1) On May 9, 2022, Defendant filed the present\nMotion. (D.I. 25)\n\nB. Facts Regarding Decedent\u2019s Alleged Exposure History\n\nPlaintiff alleges the Decedent developed mesothelioma resulting from exposure to\nDefendant\u2019s asbestos-containing products during his service as an Engineering Officer in the\nUnited States Navy onboard the U.S.S. Exultant, a minesweeping vessel. (D.I. 1, Ex. 1 at \u00a5 4)\nPlaintiff asserts claims for wrongful death and Decedent\u2019s personal injuries (Counts I & II),\nnegligence (Count III), willful and wanton conduct (Count IV), strict liability (Count V), failure\nto warn (Count VI), misrepresentation (Count VII), conspiracy and concealment (Counts VIII &\nIX). (See \u00a2.g., id. at J] 5, 8-9, 11, 14, 17, 23, 27, 31, 34-36)\n\nRoadarmel was deposed on December 4, 2018, and is the sole product identification\nwitness in the case. (D.I. 29, Ex. 1 at 1:16) The Decedent served in the United States Navy from\n1961 through 1965. (Ud. at 34:24-25; 50:2-4) From the spring of 1962 to the spring of 1964,\nDecedent was an Engineering Officer on the U.S.S. Exultant. (Id. at 38:3-20; 111:19-22) While\nhe served as an engineering officer, he was responsible for fifteen to eighteen seamen and\nworked in both the forward and aft engine rooms. (/d. at 39:22\u201425; 40:8-11) He traces his\n\nbystander asbestos exposure to dust released from removal and replacement of engine gaskets\n\n2 The federal officer removal statute permits removal of a state court action to federal court\nwhen, inter alia, such action is brought against \u201c[t]he United States or an agency thereof or any\nofficer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or of any agency thereof, in\nan official or individual capacity, for or relating to any act under color of such office.\u201d 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1442(a)(1).\nand insulation during \u201ctear downs\u201d when the engines were rebuilt twice by servicemen under his\nsupervision. (Jd. at 118:13\u2014-119:22; 240:6-243:5)\n\nIn January of 1963, the U.S.S. Exultant\u2019s engines experienced mechanical failures on a\nvoyage to the Mediterranean and took about three weeks to repair in Naples, Italy. (Ud. at 118:1-\n24) The engines again required repairs on the ship\u2019s return trip to the United States in June of\n1963. (Id. at 119:10-22) The engines were repaired over a period of several weeks in\nCharleston, South Carolina. (Id. at 116:4~6; 119:12-18; 244:19-245:10) According to the\n\u201cReport of Material Inspection\u201d prepared by the Navy, engines No. 3 and 4 onboard the U.S.S.\nExultant were Curtiss-Wright Model 12-V-142 engines. (D.I. 29, Ex. 2 at 6)\n\nDefendant sent technical representatives both to Naples and Charleston who worked\ndirectly on the two Curtiss-Wright engines onboard the ship. (D.I. 29, Ex. 1 at 116:2\u201420; 117:2-\n14; 118:1-119:6; 241:16-23; 244:19-245:8) The teardown of the engines required the removal\nof gaskets and pipe insulation. (Jd. at 240:10\u201418; 242:14-22) The Decedent did not directly\nwork on the engines but was present in a supervisory capacity in the engine room while the work\nwas being done. (Jd. at 122:13-25) His job included keeping a log of the work performed on the\nengines. (/d. at 123:1-11) Roadarmel testified that he was exposed to asbestos from the removal\nof both the asbestos-containing gaskets and pipe insulation during the engine repairs. (Id. at\n42:1-15; 240:10-25; 241:1-2; 242:2-25, 243:1-5)\n\nRoadarmel testified he knew the engines onboard the U.S.S. Exultant were manufactured\nby Curtiss-Wright. (/d. at 41:23-25) He believed that Defendant supplied the replacement parts\nfor the engines. (/d. at 126:21-127:1; 245:11-14) Curtiss-Wright provided engine manuals\nwhich did not include any warning concerning the alleged hazards associated with asbestos\n\nexposure. (Jd. at 243:20-244:1-9) Roadarmel believed that he inhaled asbestos dust when he\nsupervised the Defendant\u2019s representatives in the engine rooms for periods up to twenty hours a\nday. (ld. at 122:15\u201420; 240:19-241:2; 243:1-5)\n\nPlaintiff retained Captain R. Bruce Woodruff as an expert witness in this case. (D.I. 29,\nEx. 3) Captain Woodruff completed an affidavit in June of 2022, attesting to Decedent\u2019s alleged\nexposure to asbestos from Curtiss-Wright engines onboard the U.S.S. Exultant. (Id.) Captain\nWoodruff concluded that during Decedent\u2019s service onboard the U.S.S. Exultant he \u201cmore likely\nthan not, was exposed to significant quantities of airborne asbestos\u201d from the gaskets during their\nrepairs. (/d. at 21) He based his conclusion on factors such as the two lengthy engine repairs\nwhich required cleaning the exhaust system and Roadarmel\u2019s testimony about being present for\nthese repairs. (/d.) Further, the removal process \u201cundoubtedly involved removal of asbestos\ninsulation and paste in the exhaust systems\u201d and it \u201cwould have created asbestos dust,\u201d which\nRoadarmel breathed. (Jd.)\n\nPlaintiff also retained Kenneth S. Garza, an industrial hygienist, and Dr. Brent C. Staggs,\na physician, as experts on airborne asbestos exposure levels and medical causation, respectively.\n(D.I. 29, Exs. 4-6) The court has not considered the opinions of these experts because they do\nnot affect the court\u2019s recommendation limited to the issue raised in the pending Motion on\nwhether the Defendant\u2019s product was a substantial factor in causing the Decedent\u2019s alleged\nasbestos related injuries.\nIi. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nA. Summary Judgment\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those that could affect the outcome of the proceeding, and \u201ca\ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury\nto return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.\n2011) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)); see Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).\n\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely disputed\nmaterial fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The burden then shifts to the non-movant to\ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial, and the court must view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458,\n460-61 (3d Cir. 1989); Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). An assertion of whether or not\na fact is genuinely disputed must be supported either by citing to \u201cparticular parts of materials in\nthe record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or\ndeclarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions,\ninterrogatory answers, or other materials,\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do not\nestablish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce\nadmissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B).\n\nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdo more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586. The \u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not\ndefeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;\u201d rather, there must be\nenough evidence to enable a jury to reasonably find for the non-moving party on the issue. See\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 247-49 (emphasis in original). \u201cIf the evidence is merely colorable, or is\n\nnot significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d Jd. at 249-50 (internal citations\nomitted); see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. If the non-movant fails to make a sufficient showing\non an essential element of its case on which it bears the burden of proof, then the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.\n\nIf a party fails to address another party\u2019s assertion of fact, the court may consider the fact\nundisputed, or grant summary judgment if the facts show that the movant is entitled to it. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(e)(2)-(3).\n\nB. Maritime Law: Substantial Factor Causation\n\nThe parties have stipulated that the court should apply maritime law to all claims and\ndefenses asserted in this case. (D.I. 22) To establish causation for asbestos related injuries under\nmaritime law, \u201ca plaintiff [must] show, for each defendant, that (1) he was exposed to the\ndefendant\u2019s product, and (2) the product was a substantial factor in causing the injury he\nsuffered.\u201d Lindstrom v. A-C Prod. Liab. Trust, 424 F.3d 488, 492 (6th Cir. 2005); see Stark v.\nArmstrong World Indus., Inc.,21 F. App\u2019x 371, 375 (6th Cir. 2001)); Dumas v. ABB Grp., Inc.,\n2015 WL 5766460, at *8 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2015), report and recommendation adopted, 2016\nWL 310724 (D. Del. Jan. 26, 2016); Mitchell v. Atwood & Morrill Co., 2016 WL 4522172, at *3\n(. Del. Aug. 29, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 WL 5122668 (D. Del. Sept.\n19, 2016); Denbow v. Air & Liquid Sys. Corp., 2017 WL 1199732, at *4 (D. Del. Mar. 30, 2017),\nreport and recommendation adopted, 2017 WL 1427247 (D. Del. Apr. 19, 2017).\n\n\u201cSn establishing causation, a plaintiff may rely upon direct evidence (such as testimony of\nthe plaintiff or [d]ecedent who experienced the exposure, co-worker testimony, or eye-witness\n\ntestimony) or circumstantial evidence that will support an inference that there was exposure to\nthe defendant\u2019s product for some length of time.\u201d? Abbay v. Armstrong Int'l, Inc., 2012 WL\n975837, at *1 n.1 (ED. Pa. Feb. 29, 2012) (citing Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at 376). On the other hand,\n\u201c\u201cTm]inimal exposure\u2019 to a defendant\u2019s product is insufficient [to establish causation]. Likewise,\na mere showing that defendant\u2019s product was present somewhere at [p]laintiff\u2019s place of work is\ninsufficient.\u201d Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492 (quoting Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at 376) (internal citation\nomitted). \u201cRather, the plaintiff must show \u2018a high enough level of exposure that an inference\nthat the asbestos was a substantial factor in the injury is more than conjectural.\u2019\u201d Abbay, 2012\nWL 975837, at *1 n.1 (quoting Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492). \u201cTotal failure to show that the\ndefect caused or contributed to the accident will foreclose as a matter of law a finding of strict\nproduct[] liability.\u201d Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at 376 (citations omitted).\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe court recommends denying Defendant\u2019s Motion because there is a genuine dispute of\nmaterial fact as to whether Defendant\u2019s engines and their asbestos-containing replacement parts\nwere a substantial factor in causing Decedent\u2019s injuries. See Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492.\nFurther, the court recommends denying Defendant\u2019s Motion with respect to Plaintiffs ancillary\nclaims because Defendant has failed to meet its burden as the movant.\n\nA. There Exists a Material Dispute of Fact Concerning Substantial Factor\nCausation\n\nThe court recommends denying Curtiss-Wright\u2019s Motion because there is a genuine\ndispute of material fact as to whether Roadarmel\u2019s exposure to asbestos is attributable to the\nCurtiss-Wright engines and their asbestos-containing components and whether they were a\n\nee\n\n3 However, \u201c\u2018substantial exposure is necessary to draw an inference from circumstantial\nevidence that the exposure was a substantial factor in causing the injury.\u2019\u201d Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at\n376 (emphasis in original) (quoting Harbour v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 1991 WL 65201,\nat *4 (6th Cir. Apr. 25, 1991)).\nsubstantial factor in causing his injuries as required by maritime law. Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at\n492. Without any citation to the record, Defendant argues that summary judgment is appropriate\nbecause the Plaintiff cannot quantify the amount of time Roadarmel spent as a bystander during\nremoval and installation of gaskets and exhaust insulation on the Curtiss-Wright engines when\nthe engines were overhauled. (D.I. 26 at 13-14) Defendant\u2019s argument ignores Roadarmel\u2019s\ntestimony in the record about his exposure and improperly disputes the significance of it.\n\nThe Defendant does not dispute that its engines were onboard the U.S.S. Exultant. (D.I.\n29, Ex. 1 at 41:23-25; D.L. 29, Ex. 2 at 6) Additionally, the Defendant does not dispute that\nRoadarmel was in proximity to its engines during four engine \u201ctear downs\u201d involving the\nremoval and installation of gaskets and exhaust insulation during which Roadarmel may have\nbeen exposed to asbestos. (D.I. 29, Ex. 1 at 118:13-119:22; 122:13-25; 240:6-243:5)\n\nThe Defendant has not refuted Roadarmel\u2019s deposition testimony and evidence in the\nrecord that the alleged asbestos-containing gaskets were Defendant\u2019s product because there were\nno spare parts on the U.S.S. Exultant. (Id. at 118:5-7; 119:17-18) There is no dispute that\nCurtiss-Wright representatives were onboard the ship for the engine overhauls. (Id. at 116:2-20)\nIn addition, the Defendant provided the replacement gaskets. (/d. at 126:19-127:1)\n\nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to\nwhether the Decedent\u2019s exposure to asbestos is attributable to the Defendant\u2019s products and\nwhether they were a substantial factor in causing his injuries. The Decedent testified that he was\nin the engine room during repairs for at least eight hours a day to up to twenty hours a day when\nthere were engineering issues. (Jd. at 122:13-20) The Decedent also testified to being present\nduring the removal and installation of the gaskets and exhaust insulation, which created dust that\n\nhe breathed. (/d. at 240:19-241:2; 242:20-243:5) Defendant\u2019s unsupported argument that such\nexposure is minimal or speculative is contrary to the requirement that the court view the record\nin a light favorable to the Plaintiff. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd., 475 U.S. at 587. Thus,\nthe record contains evidence of the Decedent\u2019s exposure to the Defendant\u2019s asbestos-containing\nproducts to sufficiently create a genuine dispute of material fact regarding substantial factor\ncausation. See Cox, et al v. Carrier Corp., et al (In re Asbestos Litig.), No. 19-548-MN-SRF,\n2021 WL 3025842, at *2,*5 (D. Del. Jul. 16, 2021), report and recommendation adopted, 2021\nWL 3662847 (D. Del. Aug. 18, 2021) (finding a genuine dispute of material fact regarding\nwhether the plaintiffs bystander exposure to asbestos dust while he worked above the boiler\nroom and swept the floor around the ship\u2019s boilers for up to twelve hours a day was a substantial\nfactor in causing his injuries).\n\nIn its briefing, Defendant cites cases in which summary judgment was granted for a lack\nof evidence that the defendant\u2019s products were a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs\nasbestos related injuries. (See D.I. 26 at 10-12) Other than citing the cases, Defendant fails to\nrelate them to the factual record in the instant case and the court finds them distinguishable. For\nexample, Defendant cites Janis v. A.W. Chesterton, Inc., et al, in which this court granted\nsummary judgment because the record showed a lack of detail about the specific work that the\nplaintiff completed in relation to the defendant\u2019s product and the plaintiff's testimony failed to\naddress the \u201cfrequency, regularity, and proximity of his work.\u201d No. 17-167-MN-SRF, 2019 WL\n264890, at *5\u20146 (D. Del. Jan. 18, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 442283\n(D. Del. Feb. 4, 2019). (D.I. 26 at 12-13) See also Moeller v. Garlock Sealing Techs., LLC, 660\nF.3d 950, 955 (6th Cir. 2011) (finding in favor of the defendant because the plaintiff failed to\nestablish that the defendant\u2019s asbestos-containing gaskets were a substantial factor in causing the\n\nplaintiff's injuries).\nUnlike Janis and Moeller, the record of the Decedent\u2019s exposure here sufficiently creates\na question of fact as to whether the Decedent\u2019s alleged exposure to asbestos during the four \u201ctear\ndowns\u201d of the engines was a substantial factor in causing his injuries. (See e.g., D.I. 29, Ex. 1 at\n122:13-20; 240:10-241:2; 242:2-243:5; 257:9-17)\n\nThe court is not persuaded by Defendant\u2019s attempt to point to the Decedent\u2019s alleged\nalternative exposures to other manufacturers\u2019 products at other places of employment. (D.I. 26\nat 13; D.I. 30 at 9-10) The court will not grant summary judgment based on speculation and\nconjecture without any facts in the record to support an alternate causation argument.\nFurthermore, the Decedent\u2019s work history outside of his service on the U.S.S. Exultant is not\nrelevant to the question presented in the pending Motion concerning whether the Decedent\u2019s\nalleged exposure to asbestos during the repair of the Curtiss-Wright engines was a substantial\nfactor in causing his injuries. See Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at 375 (noting the causation \u201cstandard is\nseparately applied to each of the defendants\u201d). Therefore, the court recommends denying\nCurtiss-Wright\u2019s Motion.\n\nB. Defendant Has Not Satisfied Its Burden Regarding Dismissing Plaintiff's\nAncillary Claims\n\nThe Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's ancillary claims, specifically\narguing for dismissal of punitive damages because the record fails to show that the Defendant\nacted recklessly or willfully. (D.L. 26 at 14-15)\n\nThe court recommends finding the Defendant has not carried its burden as the movant.\nSee Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The Defendant does not identify which counts of the complaint\nshould arguably be dismissed and refers only to general descriptions of them as \u201cancillary\u201d or\n\u201cincidental.\u201d (D.I. 26 at 14) In arguing for dismissal of punitive damages, the Defendant recites\n\nthe legal standard for assessment of punitive damages under maritime law under Exxon Shipping\n\n10\nCo. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471 (2008), but the Defendant does nothing more than argue in\nconclusory fashion that the standard is not met here. (/d. at 14-15)\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court recommends DENYING Curtiss-Wright\u2019s Motion.\n(D.L. 25)\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
