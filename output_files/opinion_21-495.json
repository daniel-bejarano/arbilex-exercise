D.I. 18)1 (\u201cthe Order\u201d) , entered in the chapter 11 cases of \nUrsa Piceance Operating Company LLC and certain of its affiliates, including Ursa Piceance \nHoldings LLC (\u201cUrsa Holdings\u201d), Ursa Piceance LLC, and Ursa Piceance Pipeline LLC \n(collectively, \u201cthe Debtors\u201d) .  The Order sustained the objection of appelle e (\u201cthe Wind -Down \nDebtor \u201d) to the Royalty Claimants\u2019 claims  and reclassified th ose claims as general unsecured \nclaims for purposes of their treatment under the Debtors\u2019 confirmed plan of reorganization.  For the reasons set forth herein, the Court will affirm the Order.  \nI. BACKGROUND \n \nA. The Debtors  \nIn 2012, Debtors were formed to operate oil and natural gas properties primarily located in \nthe Piceance Basin, Colorado, acquired from Antero Resources Piceance LLC and Antero Resources Pipeline LLC (together, \u201cAntero\u201d).   (Ursa Piceance  Bankr. D.I. 2).  In December 2012, \nUrsa Holdings, as borrower, certain other Debtors, as guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National \nAssociation, as administrative agent ( \u201cPrepetition RBL Agent\u201d), and certain lenders (\u201cPrepetition \nRBL Lenders\u201d) entered into a Credit Agreement, dated December 21, 2012 (\u201cPrepeti tion RBL \nCredit Facility\u201d).   (Id. \u00b6 22).  Debtors\u2019 obligations under the Prepetition RBL Credit Facility \n \n1  The docket of the Chapter 11 cases captioned In re Ursa Piceance Holdings, et al., Case \nNo. 20- 12065 (BLS) (Bankr. D. Del.) is cited herein as \u201c Ursa Piceance  Bankr. D.I. __,\u201d \nand the docket of the Chapter 11 case captioned In re Ursa Operating Company LLC , Case \nNo. 20- 12067 (BLS) (Bankr. D. Del.) is cited herein as \u201c Ursa Operating Bankr. D.I. __.\u201d  2 (\u201cPrepetition RBL  Obligations\u201d) were secured by substantially all of the Debtors\u2019 assets.   (Id.).  \nOn the Petition Date, Debtors owed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $209 million \non account of the  Prepetition RBL Credit Facility.   (Id. \u00b6 23).  \nIn 2018, as natural gas prices declined, Debtors encountered liqui dity i ssues.  ( Id. \u00b6 35) .  In \nDecember 2018, Debtors retained various professionals to explore options  available to address \ntheir liquidity issues, including potential  sale of the business, financing transactions, and loan \nrestructuring .  In July 2020, Debtors made the decision t o pursue  a sale process with the aim of \nconsummating a n asset sale under  section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code .  (Id. \u00b6 38).  \n B. The Chapter 11 Cases  \n \n On September 2, 2020 (\u201c the Petition Date\u201d), Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief  \nunder chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  On the Petition Date, the Debtors had $2,281,352.97 in \na bank  account where they received their primary revenues (\u201cthe Revenue Account\u201d) .  (Ursa \nPiceance  Bankr. D.I. 439 ) (\u201cSuppl. Chronister Decl.\u201d ).  This  amount  represented all of the funds \nheld by the Debtor s on the Petition Date.   (Id. \u00b6 8).   The total funds  held by all the Debtors on the \nPetition Date was $2,688,810.00, and all funds were pledged as security for the Prepetition RBL \nObligations.  ( Id.).  The Bankruptcy Court authori zed the Debtors to enter into a debtor -in-\npossession (\u201cDIP\u201d) financing facility  (Ursa Piceance Bankr. D.I. 123) (\u201c the Final DIP Order\u201d) .  \nThe DIP facility was secured by first -priority liens on all of the Debtors\u2019 assets, including all cash, \nand Debtors\u2019 obligations under the Final DIP Order were allowed superpriority claims.   (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 2(j), \n(k), (m), (n)).    \nOn September 29, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved  bidding procedures to govern a  \nsale process for all or substantially all of the Debtors\u2019 assets.   (Ursa Piceance  Bankr. D.I. 124).  \nThe sale process resulted in the selection of a  bid by third -party Terra Energy Partners LLC 3 (\u201cTerra\u201d)  in the amount of $60 million, as the baseline bid for an auction appr oved at the direction \nof the Bankruptcy Court.  O ther bidders declined to top Terra\u2019s baseline bid at the auction, and \nTerra\u2019s $60 million bid was determined to be the  highest and best offer.  (Id. at Bankr. D.I. 230).   \nThe sale closed on December 22, 2020.   (Id., Bankr. D.I. 332).  In connection with the sale, the \nDebtors received $47,095,235.78 (\u201c the Sale Proceeds\u201d).   (Suppl. Chronister Decl. \u00b6 13).   Those  \nproceeds were deposited into the Revenue Account, which held $5,205,252.83 prior to the deposit \nof the proceeds.  ( Id.).  These amounts were materially insufficient to fully repay the over $259 \nmillion owed to the Prepetition RBL  Lenders.  \n C. The Royalty Claimants  \n \nAs part of their business model, Debtors entered into many oil and gas leases with property \nowners.  The leases provide those property owners with the right to receive royalties on account \nof proceeds from the sale of hydrocarbons from wells on their properties.  The underlying dispute arises from  the Royalty Claimants\u2019 allegations that Antero and the  Debtors wrongfully deducted \noperating expenses from royalties owed  to the Royalty Claimants in the amount of approximately \n$24 million.  Debtors dispute d that any deductions they may have applied were wrongfully \nwithheld but rather were appl ied in accordance with the terms of the applicable  lease or state law.   \nBeginning in 2016, certain of the Royalty Claimants filed both individual lawsuits and class actions in Colorado state court  asserted royalty underpayments .  As  of the Petition Date,  the Colorado \nlitigation remained in its infancy.  The issues initially raised in the Colorado state court were effectively put before the Bankruptcy Court as a core proceeding for consideration and disposition of the Royalty Claimants\u2019 claim s.    \nOn October 26, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order setting the deadline for all  \ncreditors , except governmental entities, to file proofs of claims  (\u201cthe Bar Date\u201d).   (Ursa Piceance  4 Bankr. D.I. 188) .  The Royalty Claimants filed multiple proofs  of claim both before and after the \nBar Date.   The record reflect s that the Royalty Claimants initially filed their claims as secured \nclaims based on the assertion that applicable state law gave them liens on proceeds received  or \nheld by the Debtors.  On De cember 17, 2020, the Debtors filed their First (1st) Omnibus \n(Substantive) Objection to the Classification of Claims Pursuant to Section 502 of the Bankruptcy \nCode, Bankruptcy Rule 3007, and Local Rule 3007- 1 (\u201cthe Claim Objection\u201d), seeking, among \nother things, reclassification of the claims filed by the Royalty Claimants .  (Id., Bankr. D.I. 331).     \nThe Debtors objected to the classification of these claims as secured contending, first, that \nstate law did not confer secured status on the claims, a nd second, that even if the Royalty Claimants \nheld security interests, their liens would be unperfected and, therefore, fall behind hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of unpaid senior secured claims.  The Debtors sought to reclassify the claims as general uns ecured claims that would share pro rata under the Debtors\u2019 plan in distributions from \na fund for unsecured claims in the amount of approximately $500,000.  T he Royalty Claimants  \nsubsequently abandoned their contention that they are secured creditors , but filed a response to the \nClaim Objection  on December 31, 2020, arguing that any royalty shortfalls owed to the Royalty \nClaimants are monies held in trust by the Debtors for the Royalty Claimants\u2019 benefit and are not property of the Debtors\u2019 estate .  (Id., Ba nkr. D.I. 337) . \nOn January 6, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the  Wind -Down Debtors\u2019  plan of \nreorganization.\n  (Id., Bankr. D.I. 363) .  The order confirming the plan was entered on \nJanuary  8, 2021.   (Id., Bankr. D.I. 365) .   \nD. Property of the Estate Litigation  \n \nStarting on January 8, 2021, the Royalty Claimants filed various adversary proceedings \n(\u201cthe Adversary Proceedings\u201d) asserting damages for breach of contract and asking for declaratory 5 relief that cash in possession of the Wind -Down Debt or was not property of the estate.2  (Id., \nBankr. D.I. 1 8-2 (listing adversary proceedings filed by the Royalty Claimants) ).  On January 13, \n2021, the Wind -Down Debtor filed a reply in support of the ir Claim Objection , arguing that the \nproperty of the estate issue was not properly brought before the Bankruptcy Court with respect to \nthe Claim Objection and should instead be addressed through the A dversary Proceedings.  T he \nBankruptcy Court held a status conference on January 19, 2021 to discuss a  procedure for \nadjudication of the parties \u2019 disputes .  (Id., Bankr. D.I. 425).  The parties entered into a stipulation \nrelated to their disputes and later amended such stipulation to reflect the rescheduling of hearings \nand deadlines  (id. Bankr. D.I. 424, 466)  (respectively, \u201cthe Stipulation\u201d and \u201c the Amended \nStipulation\u201d).  Among other things, the parties agreed that , prior to adjudication of the merits of \nthe Royalty Claimants\u2019 claims, they would ask the Bankruptcy Court to \u201cconsider whe ther the \nmonies which the Royalty Claimants seek to recover on their royalty underpayment claims against Ursa constituted money that is not property of the Wind- Down Debtors\u2019 estate\u201d and \u201cthe amount \nof reserves, if any, that shall be maintained by the Wind- Down Debtors until the resolution of the \nAdversary Proceedings.\u201d  (Stipulation \u00b6\u00b6 6- 7).  Under the agreed procedure, t he Bankruptcy Court \nwas not asked to determine whether any amounts were deducted by the Debtors in violation of \nleases or state law , nor was it asked to  make a determin ation as to any  amounts relating  to specific \nclaimants.    \nThe parties also agreed that declarations could be filed prior to the hearing on such issues. \n(Id. \u00b6 6).   The Wind -Down  Debtor  filed the Supplemental Declaration of Jamie Chronister in \nSupport of Wind- Down  Debtors\u2019 Reply in Support of First (1st) Omnibus (Substantive) Objection \n \n2  Ursa Piceance Bankr.  D.I. 367, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, \n393, 394, 394, 396, 397, 428 (complaints initiating adversary proceedings) . 6 to Claims Pursuant to Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rule 3007, and Local Rule \n3007- 1.  (Ursa Piceance Bankr. D .I. 439).  The  Royalty Claimants filed the Declaration of Donald \nPhend in Support of the Royalty Owners\u2019  Response in Opposition to Ursa Operating Company, \nLLC\u2019s First Omnibus (Substantive)  Objection to the Classification of Claims Pursuant to Section \n502 of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rule 3007, and Local Rule 3007 -1.  (Id., Bankr. D.I. 443).  \nThe Prepetition RBL Agent also filed its  Objection to Certain Relief Requested by Royalty \nClaimants Against Collateral in the Wind- Down Debtors\u2019 Poss ession on behalf of the Prepetition \nRBL Lenders .  (Id., Bankr. D.I. 438).  \nE. The Bench Ruling and Order  \nOn March 8, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing solely on the issues agreed upon \nin the Stipulation.  ( Ursa Piceance Bankr. D.I. 480 (\u201c 3/8/21 Tr.\u201d)).  On March 11, 2021, the \nHonorable Brendan L. Shannon convened a hearing and issued a bench ruling, holding that the \nRoyalty Claimants are holders of general unsecured claims and are not beneficiaries of a trust, and \nrejecting the Royalty Claimants\u2019  arguments that the Wind- Down Debtor holds funds that are not \nproperty of the estate.  ( Id., Bankr. D.I. 482 (\u201c 3/11/21 Tr.\u201d )). \nJudge Shannon determined, inter alia , that Section 1- 203 of the Colorado Uniform \nCommercial Code, which stands for the propositio n that a lessor of goods retains a residual interest \nand title in the goods, did not support the Royalty Claimants\u2019 trust theory, as that section applies \nonly to leases of goods and does not apply to underground oil and gas or to money.  ( See id . at 8:2-\n14).  Judge Shannon further determined that although the \u201cclaims arise out of the contractual \nrelationship by virtue of the many oil and gas leases that they entered into with the debtors\u201d ( id. at \n7:22- 24), the leases at issue did not demonstrate any retaine d ownership by the lessor or an \nexpectation of a trust relationship with the lessee .  (Id. at 8:15- 18; see id. at 11:17- 19 (\u201cthe contracts 7 do not indicate or permit an inference that the debtor/lessee was holding funds or monies \nexclusively for the benefi t of the lessors\u201d)).  Judge Shannon further determined that the facts of \nthe SemCrude  case,3 relied upon by the Royalty Claimants for the proposition that that oil sale \nproceeds are held in trust for royalty owners, were not analogous to the facts of the case before it.  (Id. at 9:10- 10:1).  Having resolved those issues, the Bankruptcy Court turned to the constructive \ntrust argument, in which the Royalty Claimants sought imposition of a constructive trust, \u201ca court imposed remedy for wrongful conduct and to prevent unjust enrichment\u201d which is \u201cnot favored in bankruptcy.\u201d  ( Id. at 11:5 -9).  Judge S hannon noted:  \nAs a threshold matter, given that the parties respective rights arise \nfrom the formal contractual relationship it is difficult to perceive, as a matter of law, how a constructive trust would or should be imposed here, given that if Ursa failed to make payments it was obligated to make under the lease the remedy would appear to lie not in equity, but at law in action for breach of contract.  \n \n(Id. at 11:10- 16).  Finally, Judge Shannon addressed the Royalty Claimants\u2019 misplaced reliance on \na ruling made in the Extraction Oil & Gas\n4 case.  ( Id. at 12:10- 12).  Having determined that the \nRoyalty Claimants are holders of general unsecured claims and are not beneficiaries of a \nconstructive trust, the Bankruptcy Court sustained the Debtors\u2019 Claim Obje ction.  The Bankruptcy \nCourt entered the O rder on March 30, 2021, which stayed any rights derived from the O rder for \n14 days.  ( Ursa Piceance  Bankr. D.I. 18) . \nF. The Appeal  and Stay Motions  \nOn April 2, 2021, the Royalty Claimants filed their  appeal of the Order  and also filed  their \nEmergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal  in the Bankruptcy Court ( Ursa Operating Bankr. \n \n3  In re SemCrude, L.P., 418 B.R. 98 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009) . \n \n4  In re Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc., et al ., No. 20- 11548 (CSS) (Bankr. D. Del .)  8 D.I. 22) (\u201cthe Bankruptcy Motion for Stay\u201d).  On April 13, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court held a \nhearing  on the Bankruptcy Motion for Stay.  At the hearing , the Bankruptcy Court held that the \nRoyalty Claimants did not meet their burden for the imposition of a stay.  ( Id., Bankr. D.I. 36 \n(\u201c4/13/21 Tr.\u201d) .  Finding no predicate for the relief sought \u2013 a trust or a constructive trust \u2013 Judge \nShannon noted:  \nit was difficult for me to perceive how [such relief] might be \navailable as a matter under contract law.  And we can debate whether or not Colorado law does or does not permit the imposition of a constructive trust.  But that was not the predicate  or the exclusive \nbasis for my ruling .  I went through the arguments and the case law \nthat had been identified by the parties.  I found that there was no case law existing under Colorado law or otherwise that would have supported the relief that was being sought.   \n \n(Id. at 33:16- 34:4)  (emphasis added) .  The following day, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order \ndenying the Bankruptcy Motion for Stay but including a 21-day stay of the Order.  ( Id., Bankr. \nD.I. 37).  On April 16, 2021, the Royalty Claimants also filed a motion for stay pending appeal  in \nthis Court.  On May 4, 2021, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion denying the motion for \nstay pending appeal and permitting Wells Fargo  Bank, National Assoc iation, as Agent for t he RBL \nLenders, to intervene in the appeal .  (D.I. 21 ). \nThe merits of the appeal are fully briefed.  (D.I. 27, 28, 29, 31, 32).   The Court did not hear \noral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and \nrecord , and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.  \nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nThe Order classifying the Royalty Claimants\u2019 claims as general unsecured claims is a final \norder, and the Court has jurisdiction over this appeal  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a).  On appeal, \ndistrict courts \u201creview the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal determinations de novo, its factual findings for clear error and its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof.\u201d  In re Trans World Airlines, Inc ., 9 145 F.3d 124, 131 (3d Cir. 1998).  This Court reviews de novo the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s legal \ndetermination  as to whether  any underpaid royalties constitute property of the Debtors\u2019  bankruptcy \nestate, and that there is no legal basis for the imposition of a constructive trust.  Goody\u2019s Family \nClothing v. Mountaineer Prop. Co. II, LLC , 401 B. R. 656, 661 (D. Del. 2009) (holding that where \nan appeal only presents questions of law, the District Court is to exercise de novo review of the \nBankruptcy Court\u2019s  rulings), aff\u2019d sub nom., In re Goody\u2019s Family Clothing, Inc., 610 F.3d 812 \n(3d Cir. 2010). \nIII. ANALYSIS  \n A. Property of the Esta te \n \nFollowing Debtors \u2019 sale of  substantially all of their assets, all of which were encumbered \nby the Prepetition RBL Lenders\u2019  liens and security interests, the only assets remaining in the Wind -\nDown Debtor \u2019s estate was  the cash proceeds of the Prepetition RBL Lenders\u2019  collateral.   Pursuant \nto the Wind -Down Debtors\u2019 confirmed plan, these cash proceeds were to be  distributed to the \nPrepetition RBL Secured Parties .  These proceeds, which were a fraction of the outstanding \nPrepetition RBL Obligations, were  the only available source of recovery for the Prepetition RBL \nSecured Parties .   \nHaving abandoned their argument that their claims were secured , Appellants  sought a \ndetermination that any royalty shortfalls are monies hel d in trust by the Debtors for the Royalty \nClaimants\u2019 benefit and are not property of the  Wind -Down  Debtor \u2019s estate.  ( Id., Bankr. D.I. 337).   \nThe Royalty Claimants  argued that , under Colorado law, the leases gave them an ownership right \nover the hydrocarbons  and the associated proceeds; therefore, the Royalty Claimants contended , \nwhen Debtor s received proceeds from sale of hydrocarbons, D ebtors held the amounts representing \nroyalty obligations in trust for the Royalty Claimants and did not hold title to those funds in any 10 respect .  The Royalty Claimants alleged neither an express or statutory trust.  Ra ther, Royalty \nClaimants requested that the Bankruptcy Court impose the equita ble remedy of the i mposition of \na constructive trust.  \nProperty held by a debtor is presumed to be property of the estate .  Skilled Nursing \nProfessional Services, A Division of Skilled Nursing Home Care, Inc. v. Sacred Heart Hosp. of \nNorristown (In re Sacred Heart Hospital of Norristown), 175 B.R. 543, 555 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. \n1994).  Royalty Claimants \u2019 argument is premised on \u00a7 541(d) of the Bankruptcy Code which states, \nin relevant part : \n(d) Property in whi ch the debtor holds, as of the commencement of \nthe case, only legal title and not an equitable interest . . . becomes \nproperty of the estate under subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section \nonly to the extent of the debtor \u2019s legal title to such property, but  not \nto the extent of any equitable interest in such property that the debtor does not hold.   \n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(d).   Thus, courts have concluded that property which a debtor holds in trust \n(express or constructive) for another does not become property of the estate when the debtor files \nfor bankruptcy.  See, e.g.,  In re Columbia Gas Systems, Inc., 997 F.2d 1039, 1059 (3d Cir. 1993) \n(\u201cCongress clearly intended the exclusion created by \u00a7 541(d)  to include not only funds held in \nexpress trust, but also funds held in constructive trust\u201d).  As the Bankruptcy Court corre ctly \nobserved, imposition of a constructive trust is a court -imposed remedial device to prevent unjust \nenrichment.  (3/11/21 Tr. 11:2- 9).  \u201c[P]arties seeking to prove a trust relationship typically bear a \nvery heavy burden of proof under both state and federal law.\u201d  In re SemCrude, L.P., 418 B.R. 98, \n106 n.5 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009) .   \nIn general, \u201cto establish rights as a trust recipient, a claimant must make two showings: \n(1) demonstrate that the trust relationship and its legal source exist, and (2) identi fy and trace the \ntrust funds if they are commingled.\u201d  Goldberg v. New  Jersey Lawyers \u2019 Fund, 932 F.2d 273, 280 11 (3d Cir.  1991); In re Columbia Gas Sys. Inc., 997 F.2d 1039, 1063 (3d Cir.1993)  (\u201cbeneficiaries \nof trust funds bear the burden of identifying and tracing their trust property\u201d), cert. denied 114 S.  \nCt. 1050 (1994).  The Third Circuit teaches that we look to state law to determine whether the \nclaimant has  shown a trust relationship, but that we look t o federal law to determine whether the \nclaimant has traced and identified the trust funds.  City of Farrell v. Sharon Steel Corp., 41 F.3d \n92 (1994) (citing Goldberg, 932 F.2d at 280) ; see also Universal Bonding Ins. Co. v. Gittens and \nSprinkle Enterprises , Inc., 960 F.2d 366, 369 ( 3d Cir. 1992) ; In re Visiting Nurse Ass\u2019 n v. Bowen, \n143 B.R. 633, 641 (W.D. Pa.  1992) (\u201cOnce  a bankruptcy court makes a  determination concerning \nwhether a debtor has any legal or equitable interest in property based upon applicable state law, \nwhether the property will come into the estate is a federal question.\u201d) (internal quotations and  \ncitations omitted), aff \u2019d, 986 F.2d 1410 (3d Cir.1993) (table).  \nThe Bankruptcy Court noted that the Royalty Claimants\u2019 claims arise out of their \n\u201ccontractual relationship by virtue of the many oil and gas leases\u201d yet the leases at issue do not \n\u201cdemonstrate any retained ownership by the lessor or an expectation of a trust relationship with \nthe lessee.\u201d  (3/11/21 Tr. at 8:15- 18; see id . 8:18- 9:6 (discussing particular leases)).  Thus, \u201c[a]s a \nthreshold matter, \u201d Judge Shannon emphasized in his ruling that it \u201cis difficult to perceive, as a \nmatter of law\u201d how the Royalty Claimants can be entitled to relief in the form of a constructive trust whe n their claim \u201clie[s] not in equity, but at law in action for breach of contract.\u201d  ( Id. at \n11:10-19)).  \u201cThe contracts do not indicate or permit  an inference that the debtor/lessee was \nholding funds or monies exclusively for the benefit of the lessors.\u201d  ( Id. at 11:17- 19).  The \nBankruptcy Court ultimately  found no predicate for  a trust or a constructive trust .   \nThe Royalty Claimants argue that the Bankruptcy Court erred in finding that the  imposition \nof a constructive trust for their benefit wa s not warranted  under these facts .  (D.I. 27 at 13- 16).   12 The Royalty Claimants argue  that, under two  Colorado appellate decisions , Lawry  and Yetter , the \nimposition of a constructive trust is not precluded simply because the Royalty Claimants are \nasserting a breach of contract claim.   In Lawry v. Palm , 192 P.3d 550, 563 (2008) , however, the \nconstructive trust was premised on an unjust enrichment claim, not a breach of contract claim.  Id . \nat 564.  The Colorado Court of Appeals stated \u201c[a] plaintiff  is entitled to recover based on the \nunjust enrichment of a defendant when the plaintiff has no alternative right under an enforceable \ncontract .\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  And in Yetter  Well Serv., Inc. v. Cimarron Oil Co., 841 P.2d \n1068, 1070 (Colo. App.  1992) , the underlying cause of action was a fraudulent transfer from \nCimarron to a third party, Tandem, and the Colorado Court of Appeals did not impose a constructive trust on amounts held by Cimarron, but rather on interests transferred to the third party, Tandem.  See id . at 1070- 71. \nAppellants have failed to establish the considerations warranting imposition of a \nconstructive trust  under Colorado law .  \u201cA constructive trust . . . can at tach to property obtained \nby fraud, duress, or  the abuse of a confidential relationship, or  to any other property that \u2018in equity \nand good conscience\u2019 does not belong to the constructive trustee.\u201d  Lawry , 192 P.3d at  563 (internal \ncitations omitted).  \u201cA constructive trust is an extremely flexible remedy, appropriate in circumstances involving fraud or duress, or when a confidential relationship exists, and also to prevent unjust enrichment.  It is also  appropriate if innocent third persons have subsequently \nacquired an interest in the property.\u201d   Yetter, 841 P.2d at  1070. \nAppellants do not appear to argue that a constructive trust is appropriate here based on  \nfraud, duress, or the existence of a confidential relationship.  ( See D.I. 27 at 13- 16; D.I. 31 at 3- 4).  \nFurther, no claim has been made that the Debtor retained monies at issue with knowledge of  some \nform of a preexisting trust relationship between a third party and the Royalty Claimants.  ( See id .).  13 Appellants argue that controlling Colorado appellate decisions have consistently recognized that  a \nconstructive trust remedy is appropriate where \u201cthe person holding the [alleged] title to property \nwould profit by a wrong, or be unjustly enriched if he was  permitted to keep the property.\u201d  (D.I.  27 \nat 15 (quoting Mancuso v. United Bank of Pueblo, 818 P.2d 732, 737- 38 (Colo. 1991) ).  But the \nColorado cases that the Royalty Claimants cited  below \u2014specifically, Ralston Oil & Gas Co. v. \nJuly Corp ., 719 P.2d 334 (Colo. App. 1985), Page v. Clar k, 592 P.2d 792 (Colo. 1979), Mancuso, \nand Yetter \u2014are distinguishable by facts or circumstances that are not present here.   Ralston \ninvolved a business deal gone wrong between two former friends and neighbors .  See Ralston , \n719 P.2d at 338.  There, the court discussed imposing a constructive trust when a confidential relationship between two parties is abused.  Id .  (\u201cThus, a transfer of property obtained as a result \nof an abuse of a confidential relationship between two parties may be set aside, and the court may remedy such abuse by imposing a constructive trust\u201d).  Similarly, in Page , the court and \u201cthe \nparties . . . focused on whether there was a confidential relationship.\u201d   Page , 592 P.2d at 798.  In \nMancuso, the court held summary judgment to be improperly granted against the imposition of a constructive trust under the alternate theories of (i) abuse of a confidential relationship and (ii) a party\u2019s knowledge of a preexisting t rust relationship with a third party .  Mancuso, 818 P.2d at 737.  \nAnd i n Yetter , the court cited the Mancuso case with limited discussion in the context of \ndistinguishable facts.  Yetter , 841 P.2d at 1070- 71 (imposing constructive trust as a remedy under \nstate fraudulent conveyance statute).   \nSimply put, none of the cited decisions  were made in the context of a simple contractual \ndispute between parties in an arms -length contractual relationship about the payment terms of the \nrelevant contract , and the Roy alty Claimants have not met their burden of justifying the imposition \nof a constructive trust under federal common law or state law .   14 B. Appellants\u2019 Arguments Regarding Ownership Under Colorado Law Are \nUnsupported and Inapposite  \n \nThe Royalty Claimants argue that they have a \u201creserved ownership interest in their \npercentage royalty share of the proceeds received on Ursa\u2019s sale of the natural gas products \nproduced and sold from wells subject to the Royalty Claimants\u2019 leases.\u201d  (D.I. 27 at 8).  In support \nof this argument, the Royalty Claimants cite the Colorado Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Simson v.  \nLangholf , 293 P.2d 302 (Colo. 1956).  ( See i d. at 7 -8).  In Simson, the Colorado Supreme Court \ndistinguished a mineral interest from a roya lty interest, quoting the Supreme Court of Oklahoma \nthat explained that under Oklahoma law a royalty  interest is \u201can interest in the proceeds derived \nfrom the minerals which a lessee has located,  developed and produced.\u201d   Id. at 307.  But  the Court \nagrees with the Wind -Down Debtor that  Simson does not  support the Royalty Claimants\u2019 \ncontention that they have a reserved  ownership  interest in the sale proceeds \u2014nor do any of the \nother cases cited by the Royalty Claimants .  As the Wind -Down Debtor correctly point s out, this \nwould be true  only if the Debtor s held  amounts in trust for the Royalty Claimants, which they did \nnot and were not  required to do under any law or contract.  See, e.g., In re MCZ, Inc. , 82 B.R. 40, \n42 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 1987) (finding debtor oilfield operator was a bailee by agreement with \nworking interest owners and had escrowed funds for royalty holders in account for sale proceeds);  \nBoyd v. Martin Expl. Co., 56 B.R. 776, 780 (E.D. La. 1986) (constructive trust placed on overriding royalty interests,  not proceeds, based on agreements showing debtor was holding interests for \nbenefit of others); In re Reichmann Petroleum Corp., 434 B.R. 790, 797 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2010) \n(constructive trust on working interests, not proceeds, held by debtor for buyers it had allegedly defrauded).   \n  15  C.  Extraction Oil & Gas Ruling  Is Inapplicable  \n \n The Royalty Claimants  argue that the same issue was decided correctly by the Bankruptcy \nCourt  in the Extraction Oil & Gas case and this Court should follow suit .  (D.I. 27 at 11- 12).  The \nRoyalty Claimant\u2019s reliance is misplaced.  After careful consideration of that ruling, Judge \nShannon observed that \u201c[t]he Extraction case does not stand for the proposition that unpaid or underpaid royalties are funds that are not property of the debtor\u2019s estate.\u201d  (3/11/21 Tr. 12:10- 12).   \nIn that case, in the context of a plan confirmation hearing, the royalty holders at issue  \nobjected to language in a proposed plan of reorganization which would have deemed them general unsecured creditors, all before the issue had been litigated or their claim had otherwise been determined.   See In re Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc., et al., No. 20- 11548 (CSS) (Bankr. D. Del. Dec. \n28, 2020) , Bankr. D.I. 1534 ( 12/22/ 20 transcript of confirmation hearing ) at 35:21- 36:2).  The \ncourt agreed with the royalty holders\u2019 position that it would be premature to classify them in the plan as general unsecured creditors before determining the bona fides of  their allegations.   (Id. at \n87:10- 88:24).  The royalty holders did not seek to prove that they had a fiduciary or trust \nrelationship with the Extraction debtors, and the court did not rule on, or otherwise consider, \nwhether the property was actually property of the estate or not.  (Id.)  The court was resolving an \nobjection to confirmation of a plan of reorganization and nothing more; it was not determinin g the \nactual  validity of their claims.   (Id. 35:21- 23, 87:10- 88:24) .  The Royalty Claimants\u2019 reliance on \nthe Extraction  is misplaced . \nThe Court agrees with the Wind -Down Debtor that a more applicable case is  Southland  \nRoyalty Co., in which  royalty claimants initiated adversary proceedings also alleging \nunderpayment of royalties.  As is the case here, the dispute in Southland turned on whether any \nunderpayment claims represented by proceeds received by the Southland debtors were property of 16 the bankruptcy estates , and the court considered cross -motions for summary judgment.  In re \nSouthland Royalty Co., LLC , Case No. 20- 10158 (Bankr. D. Del. May 14, 2021), Bankr. D.I. 1677 \n(\u201c5/12/21 Tr.\u201d) at 46:23- 47:2) .  Following full briefing and a hearing, the  court  held that the funds \nsought by the  royalty claimants were property of the  debtor\u2019s estate, not funds constituting property \nof the royalty claimants.   (Id. at 58:2- 4).  Royalty Claimants argue that the Southland decision is \nnot instructive because the oil and gas properties in Southland are in New Mexico.  (D.I. 31  at 7).  \nThe Court disagrees.  The Southland ruling was grounded in the same tenets as Judge Shannon\u2019s  \nin thi s case\u2014that, first, applicable state law only grants the claimant a right to a contractual stream \nof royalty payments, not a property interest in the oil and gas  (5/12/21 Tr. at 49:2- 5), and second, \nthe leases in question did not establish a constructive trust relationship ( id. at 52:25- 53:10).   \nD. Royalty Claimants \u2019 Reliance on the Debtors\u2019 First Day Motion  Is Misplaced  \nFinally, Royalty Claimants cite a first day motion filed by Debtors  which sought authority \nto continue making royalty payments ( Ursa Piceance Bankr. D.I. 11) (\u201c the Royalty Motion\u201d) : \n(1) Ursa \u201conly take[s] possession of the proceeds from the sale of \nthe Royalty Interest  Owners\u2019 . . . share of oil and gas production \nbecause [Ursa] market[s] and sell[s] the  oil and gas production \nbefore remitting the Royalty Payments to them\u201d ( id. at 14- 15); and  \n \n(2) \u201c[T]o the extent [Ursa has] proceeds of the Royalty Interests in [its] possession, [Ursa ] may hold only bare legal title to the oil and \ngas production attributable to the Royalty Interest Owners\u201d ( id. at \n13). \n \nAs the Bankruptcy Court noted:  \n \nThe claimants justifiably accord significance to the fact that the \ndebtors, in various first day critical payment motions, stated that \nundisputed royalty amounts should be paid under the  doctrine of \nnecessity in part on the ground that royalty amounts \u201ccould be argued to not be  property of the debtor\u2019s estate\u201d; however, the court \nis also obliged to accord weight to the  debtor\u2019s reservation contained \nin each of these motions that its qualified statements cannot  \nconstitute admissions by the debtor as to  owner ship and property of 17 the estate. Accordingly, the  quoted language from the first day \nmotions is certainly not  dispositive of the direct question that is \nbefore the court  today.  \n \n(3/11/21 Tr. at 10:2- 14).  According to the Royalty Claimants, Debtors\u2019  statem ents in support of \nthe Royalty Motion were made in accordance with relevant facts and applicable Colorado law, \nDebtors have never sought to withdraw or correct any of these statements , and the Bankruptcy \nCourt improperly disregarded them .  (See D.I. 31 at 7- 8). \nThe Court agrees  that Royalty Claimants\u2019 reliance on the Royalty Motion is misplaced .  \nThe Royalty Motion explains the legal risk of stopping payments that could lead to costly and \nunnecessary disruptions to the bankruptcy process, such as litigation.  The excerpted statements \naddress undisputed  royalty amounts , and outlining potential claims available to royalty holders in  \nthe event  payments are stopped is not an admission of those claims\u2019 validity.  Indeed, the excerpts \nquoted by the Royalty Claimants are couched in qualifying language such as \u201c may hold only bare \nlegal title,\u201d \u201c could be  argued to exclude . . . from property of the estate.\u201d  More importantly,  \nRoyalty Claimants have ignored a critical statement that applies  to all of the excerpts: \u201cNothing in \nthis [Royalty] Motion shall constitute an admission or acknowledgment by the Debtors that any \nRoyalty Interest or Working Interest, or any cash or assets relating thereto, do not constitute \nproperty of the Debtors\u2019 esta tes under \u00a7 541 of the Bankruptcy Code .\u201d  (Royalty Motion \u00b6 8 n.3). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe Royalty Claimants have not carried their burden to warrant imposition of a \nconstructive trust , and the Order will be affirmed.
