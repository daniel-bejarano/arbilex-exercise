No. 21-669 D.I. 8) is DENIED ; \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that, with respect to the above-listed Future Link case, \nDefendant\u2019s motion (C.A. No. 21-634 D.I. 8) is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE ; and \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that, with respect to the above-listed Consumeron case, \nDefendant\u2019s Rule 12 motion (C.A. No. 21-1147 D.I. 9) is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE . \nThe Court\u2019s Order is consistent with the be nch ruling announced at the conclusion of the \nhearing on November 22, 2021, pert inent excerpts of which follow:1 \nAll the motions, of course, present Secti on 101 patent eligibility issues arising \nunder motions to dismiss governed by Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).   \n I applied the well-known standards applic able to Rule 12(b)(6) motions, which \n[were] not disputed in any of the cases argued today.  I also applied the familiar \ntwo-step framework for pate nt eligibility under 35 U.S. C. \u00a7 101, as set out by the \nSupreme Court in Alice .[\n2] \n At Step One, I determine if a claim is direct ed to a patent ineligible subject matter.  \nIn particular, I determine if the claim is directed to one of the patent ineligible \n \n1 The Court adopts th e full bench ruling. \n \n2 Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , 573 U.S. 208 (2014).  3 \n concepts[:] a law of natu re, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea.   \n If the claim is not directed to  one of those patent ineligible concepts, then the motion \nis denied.  If, however, the claim is directed  to a patent ineligible concept, then at \nStep Two, the Court looks for an element or combination of elements that is \nsufficient to ensure that th e claim in practice amounts to significantly more than a \nclaim upon the ineligible concep t itself.  In other words,  the Court looks at Step \nTwo for an inventive concept.    If, but only if, the defendant prevails at both Steps One and Two, the Court may \ndeclare the claim ineligible for patenting and dismiss the patent  infringement cause \nof action.  As further support for the le gal standards, I hereby in corporate by reference the \nlegal standards for Section 101 motions and motions to dismiss as outlined in the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s recent decision in CosmoKey Solutions v. Duo Security .[\n3] \n With that background, let me tu rn to the cases.  I\u2019ll discuss them in the order that \nthey were argued this morning. \n \nSo first up is Invitae v. Natera .   \n In this case, Invitae asserts that Natera in fringes at least Claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. \n10,604,799, the \u2019799 patent.  I understand Nate ra\u2019s motion to be  challenging the \neligibility of all 16  claims of the \u2019799 patent.  Fo r reasons that I will explain, \nNatera\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied. \n I start by noting that although each patent cl aim is presumptively valid, a District \nCourt may analyze representative claims fo r patent eligibility where all of the \nasserted and challenged claims are substa ntially similar and linked to the same \npurported abstract idea.  We get that concept from among other places the Content \nExtraction  decision,[\n4] as well as Cleveland Clinic Foundation v. True Health \nDiagnostics .[5] \n Here, Natera contends that Claim 1 of the \u2019799 patent is repr esentative.  In the \ncomplaint, Invitae indicated that Claim 1 is representative ge nerally.  And in its \nbrief on the motion to dismiss, Invit ae continued to refer to Claim 1 as \nrepresentative and did not ra ise any issue with Natera\u2019s contention regarding Claim \n \n3 CosmoKey Sols. GmbH & Co. KG v. Duo Security LLC , 15 F.4th 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2021). \n \n4 Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n , 776 F.3d 1343, \n1348 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  \n5 Cleveland Clinic Found. v. True Health Diagnostics LLC , 859 F.3d 1352, 1360 (Fed. Cir. \n2017).  4 \n 1 being representative. \n Then[,] however, when we got to the post-br iefing checklist letter , for the first time \nInvitae contended that Claims 1, 5, 8, and 9 must all be considered in order to fully \nrepresent all 16 asserted claims.    In my view, this contention comes too late, so I will consider only Claim 1 and I view it as representative of  all 16 claims.  Now, of c ourse, given my decision to \ndeny the motion, Invitae can hardly complain  that there is a ny unfairness in me \ndenying the motion in full based only on considering one patent claim. \n With respect to claim construction, the Court agrees with Natera that no claim construction is necessary before deciding the motion to dismiss.  So let me turn now to application of the two-part Alice  test. \n At Step One, the Court must analyze the focu s of the claim, that is its character as \na whole and especially its purported cla imed advance.  And those concepts are \nfound, among other places, in SAP v. Investpic ,[\n6] and Finjan v. Blue Coat .[7] \n Natera argues that Claim 1 of the \u2019799 patent  is directed to the abstract idea of \u201can \nalgorithmic method of manipul ating and combining geneti c sequence data using an \n[intermediate] data set.\u201d[\n8]  What Natera has stated is, in fact, an abstract idea.  The \nFederal Circuit has found patents claiming algorithmic transformation or combination of data into a new form to be directed to an abstract idea.  Among \nother places, we see that in RecogniCorp v. Nintendo ,[\n9] as well as Digitech .[10]  So \n[what] Natera has stated . . . is an abstract idea. \n However, I do not agree with Natera that Claim 1 is directed to this abstract idea.  Instead, I find that Claim 1 is directed to  a specific solution to a technological \nproblem in the field of sequence assembly.  The claimed process enables the identification of mutations with positional accuracy in a comput ationally tractable \nmanner.  So I agree with Invitae that Claim 1 is di rected to a \u201ctechnological solution to the \n \n6 SAP Am., Inc. v. InvestPic LLC , 898 F.3d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \n \n7 Finjan, Inc. v.

Cir. 2017). \n \n10 Digitech Image Techs., LLC  v. Elecs. for Imaging, Inc. , 758 F.3d 1344, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2014). \n 5 \n technological problem of how to better asse mble DNA sequences [. . .] in a more \ncomputationally efficient and overall improved way.\u201d[11]  I have some ellipses in \nthere but all of what I said is a quote from th e plaintiff. \n The specification of the \u2019799 patent disclo ses technological problem s in the field of \nsequence assembly[,] including that where assembly provides accurate detection of \n[variants], the prior art assembly techni que was often computationally intractable \nfor high throughput data analysis.[\n12] \n By contrast, as the patent further states, [i]n the claimed process, [\u201c]the need to \ncompare each of the reads to all of the other reads is avoided, providing \ncomputational[] tractability even for very high thr oughput analyses.\u201d[\n13]   \n Hence, as I have already said, the claime d process provides so lutions to technical \nproblems in the prior art.  In my view, then, Claim 1 is analogous to  claims the Federal Circuit found to be \npatent eligible in McRO .[\n14]  The claims there were [\u201c]limited to rules with specific \ncharacteristics[\u201d] that allow[ed] [\u201c]com puters to produce accurat e and realistic lip \nsynchronization and facial expressi ons in animated characters.[\u201d15] \n The claims in McRO  went [\u201c]beyond merely organi zing existing info rmation into a \nnew form[\u201d] and additionally used [\u201c]a combined order of specific rules that \nrender[ed] information into a specific form at that [was] then used and applied to \ncreate desired results: a sequence of  synchronized, animated characters.[\u201d\n16] \n \nSimilar to this, here, Claim 1 sets forth [\u201c ]a set of concrete steps specific to the \n[\u2018]contig[\u2019 ]based assembly of DNA sequences to solve the technological problem of improved sequence assembly fo r better mutation detection.[\u201d\n17]  That is \nessentially a quote from . . . one of the briefs, and I agree with it. \n I am not persuaded by Natera\u2019s an alogy to the claims at issue in In re Board of \n \n11 D.I. 13 at 1. \n \n12 \u2019799 patent at 2:1-6. \n \n13 Id. at 2:41-43. \n \n14 McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc. , 837 F.3d 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \n \n15 Id. at 1313 (internal citation a nd quotation marks omitted). \n \n16 Id. at 1315 (internal citation a nd quotation marks omitted). \n \n17 D.I. 13 at 8. \n 6 \n Trustees of Leland Stanf ord Junior University .[18] \n In Stanford , the claims were drawn to a [\u201c ]computerized method of inferring \nhaplotype phase in a collecti on of unrelated individuals.\u201d[\n19]  The claimed method \nin Stanford  invoked [mathematical] technique s but [\u201c]recit[ed] no application, \nconcrete other otherwise, beyond storing the haplotype phase.\u201d[20]  \n By contrast, here, Claim 1 not only recites an algorith mic method of manipulating \nand combining genetic sequence data, it also  recites the application of the method \n\u201cto map positional information of mutations found in the individual reads relative to the reference.\u201d[\n21]  That\u2019s from . . . the last part of Claim 1. \n Thus, contrary to Natera\u2019s suggestion, Stanford  does not hold that claims drawn to \nnew and improved computerized methods of  analyzing genetic data can never be \npatent eligible.  Instead, where, as here , the claims recite applying the new and \nimproved computerized methods to prac tical technological improvements, such \nclaims may be[,] and here are[,] patent eligible. \n When Natera says that the claims before me are directed to just a mathematical \nresult or simply involve us ing computers as tools rather  than any imp rovement in \ncomputers or other t echnology, I disagree. \n Natera also argues that the Court should not  be giving credit to Claim 1 for solving \nthe computational tractabili ty problem.  Natera\u2019s position is unpersuasive.   \n \nEven though Claim 1 does not expressly re cite the concept of computational \ntractability, all the algorithmic steps that render sequence assembly of high throughput data computationa lly tractable are recited in the claim, which is \nsufficient for purposes of the pendi ng motion.  We know from cases like Uniloc ,[\n22] \nas well as . . . last week\u2019s decision Mentone Solutions LLC v. Digi International \nInc.,[23] . . . that the claims themselves do not need to necessarily articulate the \nadvantages of the claimed combinations or of the invention in order to be patent \neligible. \n \n18 In re Bd. of Trs. of Le land Stanford Junior Univ. , 991 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2021). \n \n19 Id. at 1250. \n \n20 Id. \n \n21 \u2019799 patent, cl. 1. \n \n22 Uniloc USA, Inc. v. LG Elecs. USA, Inc. , 957 F.3d 1303, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2020). \n \n23 Mentone Sols. LLC v. Digi Int\u2019l Inc. , 2021 WL 5291802, at *5 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 15, 2021). \n 7 \n  \nMoreover, as the specification of the patent[-]in[-]suit here explains, sequencing and genotype analyses on high throughput da ta [\u201c]were previously computationally \nintractable.[\u201d\n24]  That\u2019s stated explicitly [in the pa tent].  But now, in light of the \ninvention, [they] can be performed using existing computers that  apply the claimed \nprocess.  Thus, just like in McRO , \u201c[i]t is the incorporation of the claimed rules, not \nthe use of the computer, that improve d the existing technological process.\u201d[25]   \n So . . . the defendant has fail ed at Step One.  Therefore, there is no need for me to \nmove on to Step Two, and I will not proceed to Step Two.   \n So for all those reasons, Natera\u2019s motion is denied. \n Let me next turn to the second case that was argued, Future Link v. Amlogic . \n Future Link asserts that at least Claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 7,917,680 is infringed \nby Amlogic.    The parties assume that Amlogic\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss implicates all \n20 claims of the \u2019680 patent, and the Court makes this assumption as well.  So my \ndecision today applies to a ll of the patent[] claims. \n The parties agree that no claim constructi on is necessary before I rule on patent \neligibility.  \nThe parties . . . disagree on wh ether Claim 1 of the \u2019680 patent is representative of \nall 20 claims in the patent.  I tend to  agree with Amlogic that Claim 1 is \nrepresentative[,] but given how I\u2019m resolvi ng this motion, I need not actually decide \nthe dispute over representativeness.  This is because, for reasons that I will  explain, Amlogic\u2019s motion to dismiss will \nbe denied without prejudice to renew at th e case dispositive moti on stage.  Because \nI am denying the motion, it is fair to bot h parties that I anal yze only Claim 1, which \nis what Amlogic has encouraged me to do.  At Step One, the parties emphasize different lines of Federal Circuit cases.  Amlogic argues that the claims of the \u2019680 patent are directed to the abstract idea \nof organizing, generating, and transmittin g data or, alternat ively, organizing and \ntransmitting information accord ing to a set of rules. \n \n \n24 \u2019799 patent at 4:50-51. \n \n25 McRO , 837 F.3d at 1314 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \n 8 \n If Amlogic is right that the cl aims are directed merely to manipulation of data, then \nthe claims are directed to  an abstract idea.  We know that from many cases, \nincluding Digitech Image [26 and] Electric Power Group .[27] \n \nAmlogic also contends that the \u2019680 claims use result-based functional language \nthat does not explain how to accomplish the desired results.  If this is true, this may \nwell be a clue that the cl aims are directed to an abstract idea.  We know that from, \namong other places, Two-Way Media .[28] \n \nAmlogic also analogizes practice of the cla ims before me to real world situations \nprior to the Internet.  For instance, post office workers sorting and delivering mail.  \nWe know from cases like Intellectual Ventures v. Symantec [29] . . . that that type of \nreal world analogy, if apt, ma y be another clue that the claims are directed to an \nabstract idea.  For its part, on the other hand, Future Link ar gues that the inven tions in the \u2019680 \npatent meet a challenge uni que to computer networks. \n If Future Link is correct, we know that claims that are directed to a specific \nimprovement in computer technology and are not merely directed to use of \ncomputers as tools . . . are not abstract and therefore are patent eligible.  We know \nthat from many cases, including Visual Memory .[\n30] \n \nGiven my analysis of Step Two, which I will turn to in a moment, I need not and do not decide today which party is correct  at Step One.  Instead, I will assume, \nwithout deciding, that Amlogic is correct that th e \u2019680 claims are directed to the \nabstract idea Amlogi c has articulated. \n Even granting Amlogic that assumption, Aml ogic has failed to persuade the Court \nthat it should grant the pendi ng motion for reasons I\u2019ll disc uss in a moment at Step \nTwo.  \n \n26 Digitech , 758 F.3d 1344. \n \n27 Elec. Power Grp., LLC v. Alstom S.A. , 830 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \n \n28 Two-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast Cable Commc\u2019ns, LLC , 874 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \n \n29 Intell. Ventures I, LLC v. Symantec Corp. , 838 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \n \n30 Visual Memory LLC v. NVIDIA Corp. , 867 F.3d 1253 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \n 9 \n The Federal Circuit has employed a similar approach and resolved 101 issues at \nStep Two in several of its cases, most recently CosmoKey [31] as well as Amdocs .[32]  \n And with some frequency, District C ourts have done the same thing. \n For instance, the Southern District of New York stated in Personalized Media \nCommunications LLC v. Netflix Inc. , \u201c[a]lthough courts ordina rily resolve step one \nbefore proceeding to step two, it is within a court\u2019s discretion to skip straight to \nstep two.  In doing so, the cour t must still consider step one  issues to the extent that \nthey bear on the step two analysis.\u201d[\n33] . . . \n The Personalized Media  court cited numerous . . . Dist rict Court cases that have \ndone this. . . .  I agree with the Personalized Media  court . . . . \n So let me turn to Step Two.  At Step Two, I begin with the premise that the Federal Ci rcuit announced in Aatrix , \n\u201c[w]hile the ultimate determ ination of eligibility under \u00a7 101 is a question of law, \nlike many legal questions, ther e can be subsidiary fact questions which must be \nresolved en route to the u ltimate legal determination.\u201d[\n34] \n Further, as the Court stated in Berkheimer , \u201c[t]he question of whether a claim \nelement or combination of  elements is well-underst ood, routine and conventional \nto a skilled artisan in the releva nt field is a question of fact.\u201d[\n35] \n \nHere, I agree with Future Li nk.  There is at least a fact  dispute as to whether the \n\u2019680 patent\u2019s combination of protocol[] compliance rules[] a nd performance-based \nrules, which is the patent\u2019s alleged inve ntive concept, . . . was conventional, well \nunderstood and routine at the pertinent date.  Notably, the specification explains that th is combination of protocol[] compliance \nrules[] and performance-based rules is the key aspect of the claimed invention for \nreasons including that this co mbination helps to reduce or eliminate data collisions \nbetween channels. \n \n31 CosmoKey , 15 F.4th 1091. \n \n32 Amdocs (Isr.) Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc. , 841 F.3d 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \n \n33 Personalized Media Commc\u2019ns LLC vs. Netflix Inc. , 475 F. Supp. 3d 289, 298 (S.D.N.Y. \n2020).  \n34 Aatrix Software, Inc. v.  Green Shades Software, Inc. , 882 F.3d 1121, 1128 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \n \n35 Berkheimer v. HP Inc. , 881 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \n 10 \n  \nAmlogic did not address the combinati on of protocol compliance rules and \nperformance-based rules in  its opening brief. \n Then in its reply brief, Amlogic\u2019s only rebuttal was to express doubt [as to whether] \n\u201cprior to the \u2019680 patent, performance-based and protocol -based packet ordering \ntechniques had never been combined to improve communications speed between computer components.\u201d[\n36] . . . \n But Amlogic\u2019s argument only serves to illustra te the material fact dispute revealed \nby the minimal record at this stage of the case.  On a motion to dismiss, of course, \nI cannot resolve such a factua l question in Amlogic\u2019s favor. \n Today, Amlogic asserted there is a deficien cy in the claims that cannot be fixed by \nany factual presentation or the resolution of any fact disputes.  In making this \nargument, I think Amlogic is simply reit erating its Step One contention that the \nclaims contain only gene ric functional language a nd result[-]based claiming \nwithout the required detail as to how  the purported technol ogical solution is \naccomplished.  I have assumed without deci ding that Amlogic has the be tter of the arguments at \nStep One, but even making that assumption[,]  I see no basis in either the claims or \nin the law to further conclude that the f act dispute I have identified at Step Two \nwould be immaterial to the issue of patent eligibility.  In other words, I cannot today \nconclude that the claims are so  deficient that I mu st, today, find them to be ineligible \nfor patenting. \n Accordingly, Amlogic\u2019s motion to dismiss must be, and is, denied. \n Under these circumstances, Future Link agreed  in its checklist letter that denial of \nAmlogic\u2019s motion should be without prejudice.[\n37]  . . . \n Therefore, and I agree with that, Amlogi c may bring another motion raising its 101 \narguments, but it cannot do so until the case dispositive motion [stage] of this case after full discovery and, of course, it may onl y do so, as with a ny motion, if at that \npoint Amlogic believes it has a good- faith basis to pursue that motion. \n \nSo with that, let me turn finally to the third case argued today, Consumeron v. \nMaplebear .[\n38]   \n \n \n36 D.I. 11 at 8. \n \n37 D.I. 20 at 3. \n \n38 MapleBear Inc. is doin g business as Instacart. 11 \n In this case, Consumeron asserts four  patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,244,594; \n9,202,191; 10,115,067; and 10,628,835.  The partie s agree that the motion is \ndirected to all 88 claims of these four patents.  The part ies disagree as to which of \nthe 88 claims I have to analyze in order to  make a decision that can apply to all 88 \nclaims.    Instacart asks [that] all 88 claims be considered togeth er because in its view, none \nraises distinct[] issues affecting eligibility.  It seems to be arguing that Claim 1 of \nthe \u2019594 patent is therefore representative  of all 88 claims.  Consumeron disagrees \nthat Claim 1 of the \u2019594 [pat ent] is representative, a lthough it is not clear how many \nclaims Consumeron thinks I ne ed to analyze in order to make a decision on all 88 \nclaims.  I am not today going to resolve the repres entative claim issue.   I\u2019m not going to \nresolve much else that the parties dispute in this case . . . because I find that the defendant has failed in one of the most ba sic tasks required of the party moving to \nend a patent infringement cause of ac tion based on Section 101.  That is, the \ndefendant must, and here did not , articulate an abstract idea th at is fair to the claims \nbeing challenged.    Instacart contends that Claim 1 of the \u2019 594 patent is directed to \u201cconnecting buyers \nand sellers.\u201d  That is an abst ract idea.  I\u2019m not sure that plaintiff even disputes that \nthat broad generalization is an abstract idea.   However, in my view, this is . . . an \nentirely unfair characteriza tion of what the claim or the claims [are] actually \ndirected to.  It is far too general and far too broad.   \n \n. . . Claim 1 of the \u2019594 pate nt . . . when read in light  of the specification, makes \nclear that the purported adva nce focuses on improving me thods of shopping for and \ndelivering goods.  However, Instacart\u2019s ar ticulation of the abst ract idea does not \neven reference delivery, nor does Instacart\u2019s abstract idea reference buyers being \nable to see the products they  seek to purchase in real- time.  Nor doe s Instacart\u2019s \nabstract idea reference personal shoppers.  Instacart\u2019s abstract idea . . . is so broad th at it seems to me it might capture an old-\nfashioned printed phonebook or might also capture a phone call between, for \nexample, someone who wants to buy a car and a recorded message at a car dealer[ship] providing the hour s the showroom is open.  Instacart is just not being \nfair to the claims.    Instacart likens the claims here to those at issue in Baggage Airline[] Guest Services \nInc. v. Roadie Inc. ,[\n39] which found claims to be dir ected to non-patentable subject \nmatter, and that decision was summarily affirmed by the Federa l Circuit.  And I \n \n39 Baggage Airline Guest Servs ., Inc. v. Roadie, Inc. , 351 F. Supp. 3d 753 (D. Del.), aff\u2019d , 783 F. \nApp\u2019x 1022 (Fed. Cir. 2019). 12 \n agree, at least, on the surface there do[] ap pear to be significa nt parallels between \nthe claims invalidated in Baggage Airline and the claims asserted here. \n This makes it all the more striking that Instacart, fo r whatever reas on, chose not to \nmodel its articulation of the abstract idea on the abstract idea that [the] Baggage \nAirline  [court] was persuaded by.  There, th e abstract idea was \u201ccoordinating and \nmonitoring baggage delivery.\u201d  By contrast, here, as I\u2019ve  noted . . . , Instacart\u2019s \npurported abstract idea [\u2013] connecting buyers and sellers [\u2013] does not even give the \nclaims credit for the delivery requirement.  Mind you, I\u2019m not saying that the Baggage Airline  abstract idea definitely is one \nthat would be fair to Consumeron\u2019s cl aims, although I\u2019m also not saying that it \nis not fair to these claims.  These are issues I don\u2019t have to, and will not, today \ndecide.  I just don\u2019t, howe ver, understand why Instacart did not state the abstract \nidea with at least the same level of  specificity as the defendant in Baggage Airline , \nwhich is the case that Instacart pre sses on me as most analogous here. \n The importance of fairly stating an abstra ct idea to which the claims are allegedly \ndirected is clear from many d ecisions of the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit.  \nI\u2019ll talk about just a few.  For instance, in McRO ,[\n40] the Federal Circuit warned, \u201c[c]ourts must be careful to \navoid oversimplifying the claims by l ooking at them generally and failing to \naccount for the specific requirements of the claims.\u201d  Further, in Enfish ,[41] the \n[Federal Circuit] stressed that courts must  avoid \u201cdescribing the claims at . . . a high \nlevel of abstraction and untethered fr om the language of the claims.\u201d \n Just last week in Mentone Solutions ,[\n42] a case I\u2019ve already referenced, the Federal \nCircuit reversed a 101 decision from this [C ]ourt[,] faulting the formulation of the \nabstract idea a[t] too high  level a description of the invention, noting it was one \nwhich failed to mention aspects of the i nvention.  Accordingl y, the abstract idea \nidentified by this Court was, in the view of the Federal Circuit, \u201cuntethered to the invention as claimed.\u201d[\n43]  And the claims, therefore, were found to be patent \neligible.  . . . I recognize I did discuss with the pa rties potentially narrow er articulations of \nwhat the claims here are fairly directed t o.  Perhaps they\u2019re more  properly said to \n \n40 McRO , 837 F.3d at 1313 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \n \n41 Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp. , 822 F.3d 1327, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \n \n42 Mentone Sols. , 2021 WL 5291802. \n \n43 Id. at *6.  \n 13 \n be directed to coordinating the purchase and delivery of  goods remotely and using \ngeneric computer components, or perhaps we just need to add the concepts of real-time visualization of products and GPS tracking and a mobile delivery agent \nsystem.  I\u2019m not saying today that any of those articulations would be fair to the \nclaims, although I\u2019m also not  saying they would not be. \n [T]he point here is that the burden is very much on the defendant as the moving \nparty to articulate in a timely manner \u2013 that is , in its opening brief [\u2013] . . . an abstract \nidea that is fair to  the claims.  The defendant cannot  brush off this obligation by \narguing after briefing and after the checklist  letter that maybe it could have done a \nbetter job and insisting that  the analysis would be no different had it done so. \n Instead, in order to give the plaintiff a fair opportunity to  respond and to attempt to \npreserve the property rights th at it is presumed to have as a result of the issuance of \na patent, and in order to give the Court a fair opportunity to understand both parties\u2019 \nbest arguments, and prepare to resolve the pa rties\u2019 dispute, it is imperative that the \ndefendant, again in a timely ma nner, state an abstract idea th at is fair to the claims \n. . . .  [W]here[,] [as] here[,] the defendan t has not met this obligation[,] [t]he Court \nis free to deny the motion on that basis al one and that is what  I am doing today. \n It\u2019s not the first time  that I or other judges have de nied 101 motions on this basis. \nAt an earlier 101 day in June of 2019 in a Digi Portal v. Quotient [\n44] decision, I did \nmuch the same thing.  I said there that . . . the defendant had oversimplified the \nabstract idea[, and the] claim [wa]s directed  to more than just providing targeted \ninformation, including advertis ing to a user.  I went on to say there: [\u201c]While it may \nbe possible that [the claim at issue] could be accurately characterized as directed to \nsome abstract idea, all I need to decide [i s] that the claim [is] not directed to the \nabstract idea articula ted by [the] defendant.[\u201d45]  I further said that the defendant\u2019s \ncharacterization there of the claim was not correct and so my denial of the \ndefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was without prejudice and that the defendant might \nhave another opportunity to try to  meet its burden at Step One. \n Judge Hall, in a Report and Recommendation in the CoolTVNetwork.com v. \nFacebook case,[\n46] . . . which I adopted . . . , explai ned and did much the same thing. \n. . . Judge Hall did the same thing in Wildcat Licensing ,[47] a . . . Report and \nRecommendation, which Judge Noreik a of this [C]ourt adopted.   \n \n44 3G Licensing, S.A. v. HTC Corp. , 2019 WL 2904670, at *2 (D. Del. July 5, 2019). \n \n45 Id. \n \n46 CoolTVNetwork.com, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc. , 2019 WL 4415283, at *11 (D. Del. Sept. 16, \n2019), report and recommendation adopted , 2020 WL 1164224 (D. Del. Mar. 11, 2020).  \n \n47 Wildcat Licensing WI LLC v. Faurecia S.A. , 2019 WL 7067090, at *5 (D. Del. Dec. 23, 2019), \nreport and recommendation adopted , 2020 WL 95481 (D. Del. Jan. 8, 2020).  14 \n  \nWhat Judge Hall wrote . . . in Wildcat Licensing  was: \u201cSeveral judges in this \n[d]istrict, including me, ha ve denied a motion to dismiss under 101 when the \ndefendant failed to adequately characterize the idea to which the claims were directed, including when the defendant oversim plified the idea of the claims in its \npurported abstract idea or when the defenda nts\u2019 purported abstract  idea failed to \nsatisfactorily capture the s ubstance of the claims.\u201d[\n48] \n . . . Again, that is what I have found has happened here.  And I am taking the same \napproach and therefore denying Instacart\u2019s motion.    Given the defendant\u2019s failing at what is basically the first step or first part of Step One, I am not going to make any other deci sions about Consumeron\u2019 s patents today.  \nThis includes that I will not reach Step  Two.  So again, I\u2019m denying Instacart\u2019s \nmotion.    However, let me add that much of what the plaintiff has argued in its brief, and \nagain today, does raise a great deal of skepticism as to whether some or all of the claims in the four patents-in-suit are actually  directed to patentable subject matter.  \nI have already noted the Baggage Airline  analogy may turn out to be a very apt one. \n I do not think under the totality of circumst ances here that it would be proportionate \nto the defendant\u2019s failing to say that the Court will not consider  Section 101 issues \nin this case again until case dispositive motions.  I do not say that.  And one of the \ncircumstances on which I am relying in re aching this conclusion[,] . . . given the \ntotality of the circumstances[,] . . . is the expert declaration submitted by the \nplaintiff, which I looked at but have not carefully considered because I do not \nbelieve I can consider this  declaration in connection with the pending motion to \ndismiss.  It\u2019s not incorporated in or even  referenced in the operative complaint.  \nPlaintiff evidently would like to incorporate it into an amended complaint.  And if \nI am asked to evaluate the 101 issue again in this case, I would like to have the \nbenefit of the substance cont ained in that declaration.  I am not yet convinced that \nthe declaration contradicts the intrinsi c record, but I\u2019m no t making any final \ndecision on that point.  Again, I don\u2019t think that I can under the circumstances here. \n The defendant may renew its argument with respect to what it contends are contradictions between the declaration, th e substance of the declaration, and the \nintrinsic evidence if there is an amended complaint and if there is a renewed motion \nto dismiss. . . .   Let me note that my decisions today in Consumeron  are without prejudice to either \nor both parties attempting to show that  a claim or subset of claims [is] \n \n \n48 Id. \n 15 \n representative.  That is, I am not committing the Court to separately analyzing all \n88 claims of the four patents-in-suit.  I w ould encourage the parties to work together \nto agree on a limited number of claims to  be briefed and on which . . . the Court \ncould make a decision that w ould apply to all 88 claims if a new motion to dismiss \non 101 grounds is filed.    So for all those reasons, Instacart\u2019s motion is denied  without prejudice, and \nConsumeron is granted leave to file an amended complaint.  In other words, both \nsides might be viewed as being gi ven a second bite at the apple. \n  \n \n________________________________ \nHONORABLE LEONARD P. STARK \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE "}
