{"case_name": "Hodgson Mill Corporation v. Hodgson Mill, Inc.", "case_number": "20-1073", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "03-06-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nHODGSON MILL CORPORATION , \nPlaintiff, \nV. Civil Action No. 20-1073-RGA \nHODGSON MILL, INC., \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff has moved for a default judgment. (D.I. 14). The authority is Rule 55(b)(2). \nFed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). I deny the motion without prejudice , for the reasons that follow. \nI am satisfied that the factual allegations of the Complaint should be accepted as true. \nBut this is not a case where it is easy or obvious to translate the factual allegations into a \njudgment. The complaint has nine counts, eight for breach of contract and one for \"contractual \nindemnity. \" Plaintiff requests a default judgment in the amount of $5,765,541. (D.I. 14-1). In \nsupport thereof, Plaintiff submitted a three-page brief1 and a two-page unswom expert report of a \n\"valuation expert's\" calculation of damages. (D.I. 15; D.I. 15-1). Most of the brief is about the \ndefault part of this; there are two paragraphs about damages. \nI think default judgment is appropriate . But I cannot enter damages based on an \nunswom2 report of a CPA who summarizes his work as \"my findings which encompassed a \n1 The brief rather curiously describes the case as involving \"claims of breach of contract, tortious interference , and \nforeclosure on a security interest against\" Defendant. (D.1. 15 at 1). There is no claim oftortious interference and I \ndo not see any claim for foreclosure on a security interest either. \n2 It seems evident that Rule 55(b)(2) contemplates sworn proof. The \"sum certain\" of Rule 55(a) requires an \n\"affidavit. \" It would be strange indeed for an uncertain sum to require less. consultative examination of certain financial documents comparing the business condition one \nyear before and one year after the sales date.\" (D.I. 15-1 at p.2). As mentioned , there are nine \ncounts in the complaint , and there is no attempt by either the CPA or counsel to explain how the \nCPA's analysis relates to the claims of the complaint. For example, I am pretty sure that the \nCPA's work has no obvious relationship to Count 1 (incomplete documents) , Count 4 (failure to \nturn over assets), Count 5 (contaminated inventory) , Count 6 (failure to provide documentation ), \nCount 7 (letter of intent), and Count 8 (non-compete). Count 2 (undisclosed liabilities) appears \nto correspond to a figure of $415,541 in the expert report.3 Thus, the other $5,000,000 + appears \nto relate at least in part to Count 3 (misrepresentation of customer relations ) and/or Count 9 \n( contractual indemnity). 4 \nThe motion for default judgment (D.I. 14) is DENIED without prejudice . If the motion \nis renewed within ninety days with an expert declaration that appears to me to be prima facie \nsufficient to support a claimed damages award, I will either accept the findings or schedule a \nhearing to take testimony from the expert. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this ~~ay of March 2023. \n3 The $415,541 in the expert report states that the calculation is a summary of an \"attachment ,\" but the attachment \nwas not attached. \n4 The contractual indemnity provision is said to be in Article 9 of the Asset Purchase Agreement (D.I. 1, ,r 94), but, \nrather unusually for a breach of contract case, the Asset Purchase Agreement was not attached to the complaint and \nhas not otherwise been provided.
