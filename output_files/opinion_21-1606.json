Williams", "date": "11-14-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nANGELA ROMAGOSA FERNANDEZ , \nPlaintiff, \nCivil Action No. 21-1606-GBW \nV. \nTRAFIGURA TRADING , LLC, \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPending before the Court is Suzette Nicole Neyra Hendrick 's, as Temporary Administrator \nof the Estate of Angela Romagosa Fernandez (\"Hendrick\"), Motion to Substitute Hendrick (the \n\"Motion\") for the recently deceased Plaintiff Angela Romagosa Fernandez (\"Ms. Fernandez \" or \n\"Plaintiff'). D.I. 17. The Court has considered the parties' briefing. D.I. 17, D.I. 19, D.I. 20. For \nthe reasons explained below, the Court grants the Motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn November 12, 2021, Ms. Fernande z alleged that Defendant Trafigura Trading, LLC \n(\"TTL\") had trafficked in confiscated property without authorization in violation of Title III of the \nCuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, codified at 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6021, et seq. (the \n\"Helms-Burton Act\" or \"Act\"). See generally D.I. 1. On March 16, 2022, Ms. Fernandez 's \ncounsel filed a Suggestion of Death, notifying the Court and TTL that Ms. Fernandez had passed \naway on February 16, 2022. D.I. 11. The Court subsequentl y entered an Oral Order requesting \n\"decedent's successor or representati ve\" to \"file a motion for substitution \" within 90 days or risk \ndismissal ohhis suit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(a). D.I. 14. On May 3, 2022, \nTTL filed a Motion for a Stay of Proceedings until the issue of decedent Plaintiff's substitution is \n1 resolved by the Court. D.I. 15. On May 15, 2022, the Court granted the motion and stayed \"[a]ll \nproceedings in this action other than those under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25 .... pending \nthe Court's resolution of any Rule 25 Motion for Substitution.\" D.I. 16. On June 14, 2022, \nHendriks filed the Motion. D.I. 17. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(a)(l) sets forth the procedures for substitution after the \ndeath of a party. It provides, in relevant part, \"[i]f a party dies and the claim is not extinguished, \nthe court may order substitution of the proper party. A motion for substitution may be made by \nany party or by the decedent's successor or representative .\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(l). The Advisory \nCommittee on the 1963 amendments to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25 noted that \"[a] motion \nto substitute made within the prescribed time will ordinarily be granted, but under the permissive \nlanguage of the first sentence of the amended rule ('the court may order') it may be denied by the \ncourt in the exercise of a sound discretion if made long after the death ... and circumstances have \narisen rendering it unfair to allow substitution .\" Rule 25(a) should be construed liberally \"to allow \nflexibility in substitution of parties.\" Boggs v. Dravo Corp., 532 F.2d 897, 900 (3d Cir. 1976) \n(citing Rende v. Kay, 415 F.2d 983, 986 (1969)). \n\"When a party to a lawsuit dies, the threshold consideration pursuant to Rule 25(a)(l) is \nwhether the claim is extinguished. \" Giles v. Campbell, 698 F.3d 153, 155-56 (3d Cir. 2012). If a \nclaim is extinguished upon the death of a party, then the case should be dismissed. Ex parte \nSchreiber , 110 U.S. 76, 80 (1884). Whether a claim is \"extinguished \" upon the death of a party is \ndetermined by \"the nature of the cause of action for which the suit is brought.\" Id. If the cause \nof action is federally created, then federal law governs survivability. See, e.g., Harrow v. \nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am., 279 F.3d 244, 248 (3d Cir. 2002); Sinito v. US. Dept. of Justice, 176 \n2 F.3d 512, 513 (D.C. Cir. 1999); US. v. NEC Corp., 11 F.3d 136, 137 (11th Cir. 1993); Smith v. \nDept. of Human Servs., State of Okla., 876 F.2d 832,834 (10th Cir. 1989); Mallickv. Int'! Bhd. of \nElec. Workers, 814 F.2d 674, 676-77 (D.C. Cir. 1987); James v. Home Const. Co. of Mobile, Inc., \n621 F.2d 727, 729 (5th Cir. 1980); see also 6 MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE -CIVIL \u00a7 25.11(3) \n(2021 ). \nFederal common law applies if the statute is silent regarding whether the action survives \nthe death of a party. Schreiber, 110 U.S. at 80. \"It is well-settled that [under federal common law] \nremedial actions survive the death of the plaintiff, while penal actions do not.\" NEC, 11 F.3d at \n137; see also Harrow, 279 F.3d at 248 (finding ERlSA action remedial in nature and, therefore, \nsurvived death of party); James, 621 F.2d at 729-30 (\"Traditionally, the rule has been that actions \nfor penalties do not survive the death of the plaintiff.\") (citation omitted). \"A remedial action is \none that compensates an individual for specific harm suffered, while a penal action imposes \ndamages upon the defendant for a general wrong to the public.\" NEC, 11 F.3d at 137 (citation \nomitted). \nTo determine whether a statute is remedial or penal, the Third Circuit looks at Congress ' \nintent when enacting the statute. See, e.g., Revock v. Cowpet Bay W Condo Ass 'n, 853 F .3d 96, \n109-10 (3d Cir. 2017); Harrow, 279 F.3d at 248. Other Circuits have adopted a three-prong test \nto make this determination: \n(1) whether the purpose of the statute was to redress individual wrongs or more \ngeneral wrongs to the public; (2) whether recovery under the statute runs to the \nharmed individual or to the public; and (3) whether the recovery authorized by the \nstatute is wholly disproportionate to the harm suffered. \nNEC, 11 F.3d at 137 (citing In re Wood, 643 F.2d 188, 191 (5th Cir. 1980)); see also James, 621 \nat 730; Dept. of Human Servs., 876 F.2d at 835. \n3 III. DISCUSSION \nFor the reasons explained below, the Court finds the claims brought under the Helms\u00ad\nBurton Act are not extinguished upon the death of a party because the Act is remedial in nature. \nThus, Hendrick 's Motion is granted. \na. Whether the Purpose of the Helms-Burton Act was to Redress Individual \nWrongs or More General Wrongs to the Public \nThe Helms-Burton Act is silent regarding whether a claim is extinguished after the death \nof a party. Thus, the Court must apply federal common law and determine whether the Act is \nremedial or penal. See Schreiber, 110 U.S. at 80; Harrow, 279 F.3d at 248. The first part of the \nthree-prong test overlaps significantly with the Third Circuit's analysis of determining Congress' \nintent. The Court combines its analysis here. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that \nthis factor weighs in favor of finding the Act remedial. \nTTL argues that the Act is penal because its primary goal \"is to deter certain behavior in \nand engagement with Cuba.\" D.I. 19 at 10; see also id. at 12. The Court agrees that the Act's \npurpose was, in part, deterrent , but the language of the Act and the legislative history indicates that \nthe primary purpose of the Act is remedial. First and foremost, the Act provides redress to \"United \nStates nationals who were the victims of these confiscations.\" 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 6081 (11 ); see also id. \n\u00a7 6022(6) (\"[T]he purposes of this [Act] are ... to protect United States nationals against \nconfiscatory takings and the wrongful trafficking in property confiscated by the Castro regime. \"). \nTo the Court's knowledge there is only one court to have ruled on the issue of whether the \nHelms-Burton Act is remedial or penal in nature and whether claims brought under the Act survive \nthe death of a party. See Soto v. Booking.Com B. V, No. 20-24044, 2021 WL 7710484 (S.D. Fla. \nSept. 29, 2021). In Soto, the court granted the Plaintiff's motion to substitute a party, because it \n4 found the Helms-Burton Act remedial in nature. Id. at *2. The Court finds the Soto opinion \npersuasive. \nUnder Title III, the Act lists \"findings\" made by Congress that are instructive to determine \nthe purpose of the Act. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6081. It notes that since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba \nin 1959, \"he has trampled on the fundamental rights of the Cuban people\" and has confiscated \nproperty from his own citizens, United States nationals , and \"thousands more Cubans who claimed \nasylum in the United States as refugees because of persecution and later became naturalized \ncitizens of the United States.\" Id. \u00a7 6081(3). The Act further notes that the international judicial \nsystem \"lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful confiscation of property and for unjust \nenrichment from the use of wrongfull y confiscated property by governments and private entities \nat the expense of the rightful owners of the property. \" Id. \u00a7 6081(8). The \"findings\" section ends \nwith the following: \nThe United States Government has an obligation to its citizens to provide protection \nagainst wrongful confiscations by foreign nations and their citizens, including the \nprovision of private remedies. [] To deter trafficking in wrongfully confiscated \nproperty, United States nationals who were the victims of these confiscations \nshould be endowed with a judicial remedy in the courts of the United States that \nwould deny traffickers any profits from economicall y exploiting Castro's wrongful \nseizures. \nId. \u00a7 6081(10), (11 ). \nThe \"findings\" section suggests that the Act was intended to redress individual wrongs. \nAdditionally , the heading of\u00a7 6082, which sets out the elements of a Helms-Burton Act \nclaim, is titled \"Civil remedy.\" Id. \u00a7 6082(a). This one fact alone is not dispositive that the Act is \nremedial, but \"heading[s] of a section are 'tools available for the resolution of doubt' about the \nmeaning of a statute.\" Thorne v. Pep Boys Manny Moe & Jack Inc., 980 F.3d 879, 891 (3d Cir. \n2020) (citing Almendarez-Torr es v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 234 (1998)). A \"civil remedy\" \n5 is \"remedial in nature.\" United States v. Doman, 255 F.2d 865, 868 (3d Cir. 1958), aff'd sub nom. \nKoller v. United States, 359 U.S. 309 (1959). The legislative history also states that the Act is a \ncivil remedy: \nThe purpose of this civil remedy is, in part, to discourage persons and companies \nfrom engaging in commercial transactions involving confiscated property, and in \nso doing to deny the Cuban regime ... the capital generated by such ventures and \nto deter the exploitation of property confiscated from U.S. nationals. \nH.R. Rep. No. 104-468, 58 (1996) (Conf. Rep.), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 558, 573 \n( emphasis added). \nThe Court acknowledges that the legislative history also states that the Act would \"deter \nthe exploitation of property confiscated from U.S. nationals.\" Id. As observed by the court in \nSoto, \"[w]hile it is true that the right of action provided by the Act will inevitably serve as a \ndeterrent, its primary purpose is to provide redress for individuals who would otherwise have no \nother avenue for redress.\" Soto, 2021 WL 7710484, at *2. \nOther courts, when interpreting the same provisions in Title III of the Helms-Burton Act, \nhave also described Title III as creating \"a new statutory remedy.\" Glen v. Club Mediterranee , \nSA., 450 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted); see also Havana Docks Corp. v. \nCarnival Corp., No. 19-21724, 2020 WL 5517590, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 14, 2020) (\"Plaintiff \nseeks only to vindicate its own property rights in this action\".). \nTitle III of the Helms-Burton Act created a private cause of action for United States \nnationals in United States courts against individuals or corporations that \"traffic\" in property \nexpropriated from the Cuban government. See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6081. The purpose and plain language \nof the Act suggest it was intended to redress individual wrongs, i.e., harms done to United States \nnationals whose property was wrongly confiscated , not more general wrongs to the public. For \nthe above reasons, this factor weighs in favor of a determination that the Act is remedial. \n6 b. Whether Recovery Under the Statute Runs to the Harmed Individual or to the \nPublic \nRecovery under the Helms-Burton Act runs to the hanned individual and, thus, weighs in \nfavor of a remedial determination. Section 6082( a)(l )(A) recites, in relevant part, \"any person that \n... traffics in property which was confiscated by the Cuban Government .... shall be liable to \nany United States national who owns the claim to such property for money damages .... \" Money \ndamages are paid to the claimant. The court in Soto similarly held, \"[t]his factor[] weighs in favor \nof a remedial determination ,\" because \"[a]n award of damages under the Act goes to the claimant, \nnot the public.\" 2021 WL 7710484, at *2. \nc. Whether the Recovery Authorized by the Statute is Wholly Disproportionate \nto the Harm Suffered \nThe recovery authorized by the Helms-Burton Act is not wholly disproportionate to the \nhann suffered. Thus, this factor weighs in favor of a remedial determination. \nThe money damages awarded to a claimant under the Helms-Burton Act are the greater of \n(1) the amount certified by Foreign Claims Settlement Commission plus interest, (2) the amount \ndetermined by a court-appointed special master plus interest, and (3) \"the fair market value of that \nproperty, calculated as being either the current value of the property, or the value of the property \nwhen confiscated plus interest, whichever is greater.\" 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6082(a)(l)(A)(i), \u00a7 6083(a)(2). \nIn other words, the Helms-Burton Act seeks to provide a remedy- money damages equal in value \nto the confiscated property-to a claimant, whose property has been wrongfully confiscated. See \nid. \u00a7 6081(8) (stating one of the purposes of the Act is to create remedies \"for the wrongful \nconfiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the use of wrongfully confiscated property \nby governments and private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the property\"). The \nSoto court similarly found, \"[ d]amages intended to make whole an individual whose property has \n7 been confiscated can hardly be said to be disproportionate to the harm suffered.\" 2021 WL \n7710484, at *2. \nTTL argues that the law allows for treble damages, see 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6082(a)(3)(C), which \nindicates that the Act is penal, not remedial. D.I. 19 at 13-14. The Supreme Court, however, has \nfound that treble-damages provisions can have a remedial role. See e.g., Shearson/American \nExpress Inc. v. McMahon , 482 U.S. 220, 240-41 (1987) (noting the \"remedial function\" of the \n\"RICO treble-damages provision. \"); see also Ma/vino v. Delluniversita , 840 F.3d 223, 230 (5th \nCir. 2016) (\"The Supreme Court has repeatedly acknowledged that the treble-damages provision \ncontained in RICO itself is remedial in nature.\" (internal quotations and citations omitted)). This \nCourt recognizes that treble damages may serve as a means of both deterring wrongdoing and \ncompensating claimants. See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat , Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 485 \n(1977) (\"treble damages [] play an important role in penalizing wrongdoers and deterring \nwrongdoing ... It nevertheless is true that the treble-damages provision, which makes awards \navailable only to injured parties, and measures the awards by a multiple of the injury actually \nproved, is designed primarily as a remedy.\"). \n\"Even were the trebling portion of [ the Helms-Burton Act] considered to be penal in nature, \nthis one factor cannot transform [the Helms-Burton Act] into a penal statute. To find otherwise \nwould be to treat this one fact as dispositive thereby nullifying all the other indications that the \nstatute is remedial.\" See Hooters of Augusta, Inc. v. Am. Glob. Ins. Co., 272 F. Supp. 2d 1365, \n1376 (S.D. Ga. July 23, 2003), aff'd, 157 F. App'x 201 (11th Cir. 2005). \nFor the above reasons, the Court concludes that the Helms-Burton Act is primarily remedial \nwith incidental penal effects. \n8 d. TTL's Improper 12(b)(6) Arguments \nIn TTL's Opposition Brief to Hendrik's Motion, TTL raises several arguments not relevant \nto a motion for substitution. See D.I. 19 at 5-8. Rather, these arguments are relevant to a motion \nto dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Specifically , TLL argues that Hendrick \ncannot bring a cause of action under Title III of the Helms-Burton Act because ( 1) she untimely \n\"acquired\" the confiscated property, and (2) the cause of action does not trace to a United States \nnational from which property was confiscated. Id. TTL' s attempts to shoehorn arguments relevant \nto a motion to dismiss into its response to a motion for substitution is improper. \nTTL states in its \"Legal Standard\" section that \"( c ]ourts can also deny a motion to \nsubstitute if permitting substitution would be futile.\" D .I. 19 at 5. TTL cites to two cases that it \nalleges supports its proposition: (1) Hurst v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., No. 10-1001-GMS , \n2012 WL 426018 (D. Del. Feb. 9, 2012) and (2) Armstrong v. MGC Mortg. Inc., No. 1:09CV131 , \n2010 WL 4292405 (N.D.W. Va. Oct. 22, 2010). In Hurst, the court denied the motions to \nsubstitute as moot because the court granted the motions to dismiss and found that amendment \n\"would be futile.\" Hurst, 2012 WL 426018, at *l. In Armstrong , the court denied the motion to \nsubstitute because the claims were not assignable. Armstrong, 2010 WL 4292405, at *3. Neither \nof these cases support TTL's proposition that there is a futility standard when determining a motion \nfor substitution. To the extent TTL argues that there are no factual allegations to support a cause \nof action under the Helms-Burton Act, \"these arguments should be raised in a motion to dismiss\u00ad\nnot a motion for party substitution .\" See Lacambra v. City of Orange, No. 8:18-cv-00960-RGK\u00ad\nKES, 2019 WL 13036258 , at *2 (C.D. Cal. June 20, 2019) (ruling on a motion for party \nsubstitution filed pursuant to Rule 25(d)). \nIn fact, the Court noted in its Order granting TTL' s Motion for a Stay of Proceedings that, \n\"[i]n the event that the Court determines that substitution of the Plaintiff is appropriate, TTL shall \n9 have 60 days from the later of (i) the date of substitution or (ii) the date on which the substituted \nPlaintiff files any amended complaint as may be authorized by the Court in connection with the \nsubstitution , to respond to the operative complaint in place at that time.\" D.I. 16 at 1-2. Thus, \nTTL will have an opportunity to raise its arguments for dismissal. \nTherefore, at Wilmington this 14th day ofNovember 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \nthat the Motion is GRANTED . IT IS ALSO HEREBY ORDERED that, because the Court has \nresolved the Rule 25 Motion for Substitution , the stay is lifted. See D.I. 16. TTL shall have 60 \ndays from the later of (i) the date of substitution or (ii) the date on which the substituted Plaintiff \nfiles any amended complaint , as may be authorized by the Court in connection with the \nsubstitution , to respond to the operative complaint in place at that time. \n10 GREGORY 8.
