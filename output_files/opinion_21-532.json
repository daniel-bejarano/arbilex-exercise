(D.I. 1  (Application) ; D.I. 4 (Order).)   The Court\u2019s Order authorized \nPetitioner to issue subpoena s to Respondent Colorado Investment Holdings LLC  f/k/a Blessed \nHoldings LLC  (\u201cRespondent\u201d) to obtain discovery for use in proceedings in Brazil, \u201c without \nprejudice to the Respondent\u2019s right to assert objections in relation  to the subpoenas . . . .\u201d  (D.I. 4 \nat 2.)  Now p ending before the Court is Respondent\u2019s Motion to Vacate the Court\u2019s O rder and \nQuash Subpoenas.  (D.I. 9 .)   \n \n1 The Third Circuit has not decided whether a magistrate judge\u2019s decision on a \u00a7 1782 \napplication is \u201cdispositive\u201d \u2014meaning that it should be issued as a \u201cReport and Recommendation\u201d \nto the district judge and reviewed de novo, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 72(b) \u2014\nor \u201cnondispositive\u201d \u2014meaning that it may be ordered by the magistrate judge and may be \nreconsidered by the district court judge only when it is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.  See  \nArcelik A.S. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 856 F. App\u2019x 392, 396 n.6 (3d Cir. 2021).   \nIt is not for me to opine on how this ruling should be reviewed.  I note that the Third Circuit \ntreats rulings on administrative subpoenas as dispositive, see NLRB v. Frazier , 966 F.2d 812, 815\u2013\n18 (3d Cir. 1992), and there might not be a principled basis to distinguish \u00a7 1782 petitions from administrative subpoena enforcement proceedings.  That said, the Third Circuit recently acknowledged that \u201cthe majority of district courts to consider [the] question have determ ined \n\u00a7 1782 orders are non -dispositive.\u201d  Arcelik , 856 F. App\u2019x at 396 n.6.  Should Judge Andrews  \nconclude that this issue is dispositive, I offer this as a Report and Recommendation. \n 2 \n Respondent\u2019s m otion to quash has been  fully briefed, and the parties have filed numerous \ndeclarations  and status reports .  (D.I. 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23.)   Having reviewed the \nparties\u2019 submissions, for the reasons set forth  below, Respondent\u2019s Motion to Vacate the Court\u2019s \nOrder  and Quash Subpoenas  (D.I. 9) is GRANTED, and Petitioner\u2019s Application for an Order to \nTake Discovery Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 (D.I. 1) is DENIED.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nPetitioner requests discovery ostensibly for use in  Brazilian administrative proceedings \nemanating from a 2009 corporate merger transaction in Brazil, in which  JBS S.A., the world\u2019s \nlargest meat processing company, purchased  Bertin S/A.   In 2019, the Comiss\u00e3o de Valores \nMobili\u00e1rios (\u201cCVM\u201d), the Brazilian securities and exchange com mission, launched an \nadministrative proceeding related to  allegations that the controlling shareholders of JBS  S.A.\u2014\nJoesley Mendon\u00e7a Batista and Wesley Mendon\u00e7a Batista (the \u201cBatistas\u201d) \u2014committed fraud \nthrough a complex transaction whereby the Batistas , using a shell company named Blessed \nHoldings, secretly  siphoned JBS shares worth over 1 billion  Brazilian real out of the transaction \nand into their pockets.   \nIn 2018, almost a decade after the transaction at issue, Petitioner purchased shares in JBS \nS.A.  (D.I. 11.)  Shortly thereafter, Petitioner initiated  a private commercial arbitration action \nagainst the Batistas and others, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and fraud in connection with the \nJBS-Bertin transaction.  ( Id.)  The arbitration is apparently  ongoing. \nPetitioner is not a party to the CVM proceeding and has never sought to be included as a \nformal participant in that proceeding as an amicus curiae  or any other form of participa nt \nrecognized by the Brazilian legal system .  (D.I. 16, Ex. A ; D.I. 23, Ex. A.)  Notwithstanding, i n \n2021, Petitioner  filed in the CVM proceeding \u201ccertain documents and information to the case 3 \n records ,\u201d including an alleged secret agreement  employed as part of the  fraudulent scheme \ninvolving Blessed Holdings .  (D.I. 21, Ex. A .)  Petitioner requested that the CVM consider the \nalleged secret agreement  as part of the administrative proceeding.  (Id.)  The Batistas moved to \nexclude the agreement  from the record of the CVM proceeding.  (Id.)  The CVM denied the motion \nand accepted the agreement into the record , pointing out (among other things) (i) that the  \nagreement was available on the Internet , (ii) that Art. 5, item XXXIV of the  Brazilian Constitution \nguarantees  the public the general right to bring grievances  and information to the attention of \npublic authorities , and (iii)  that the Brazilian  administrative code  provides right s to those \u201cthat, \nwithout having initiated the process, have rights and concerns that may be affected by the ruling \nto be adopted.\u201d   (Id.; D.I. 16, Ex. A ; D.I. 22, Ex. A.; D.I. 23, Ex. A .)   \nOn December 6, 2021, Petitioner filed an ex parte Application, seeking documents and \ntestimony from Colorado Investment Holdings LLC f/k/a Blessed Holdings LLC (Delaware) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782.  (D.I. 1.)  On December 8, 2021, Judge Andrews issued an O rder \ngranting the Application.  (D.I. 4.)  O n January 10, 2022, Respondent  filed the pending motion, \nwhich seeks to vacate the Court\u2019s O rder and quash the subpoenas.  (D.I. 9.)  Judge Andrews \nsubsequently referred the action to me .  (D.I. 20.)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nSection 1782 of Title 28 authorizes a district court, \u201cupon the application of any interested \nperson,\u201d to \u201corder \u201d a person \u201cresid[ing]\u201d or \u201cfound\u201d in this district to give testimony or produce \ndocuments \u201cfor use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a).   \nIn accordance with Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241 (2004), the court \nfollows a two -step process to determine whether to grant judicial assistance under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1782.  First, the c ourt analyzes whether  \u00a7 1782 authorizes the requested discovery.  Id. at 263\u20134 64. If the statutory conditions are satisfied, the c ourt then determines in its discretion whether the\nrequested discovery should be allowed, taking into consideration the  factors identified by the \nSupreme Court in Intel .  Id.   \nIII. DISCUSSION\nI find that Petitioner does not meet  the statutory requirements  so I need not address the \nIntel factors.  See, e.g., Matter of Wei for Order Seeking Discovery Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782, No. \n18-mc-117- RGA, 2018 WL 5268125 at *1, *3 (D. Del. Oct. 23, 2018) (\u201cAs Applicant has not met\nthe statutory  requirements, there is no need to analyze the Intel factors.\u201d). \nIn particular, I find that Petitioner is not an  \u201cinterested person\u201d within the meaning of  \n\u00a7 1782.  Although Petitioner\u2019s original ex parte petition claimed that it had been \u201cformally\nrecognized as an interested party\u201d by the CVM  (D.I. 2 at 18) , the current record before the Court  \nmakes clear  that Petitioner has never sought formal participation rights in that proceeding.  (D.I. \n23, Ex. A .)  Petitioner  nevertheless  contends that it is an \u201cinterested person\u201d within the meaning \nof \u00a7 1782 because it has a general right under Brazilian law to provide information to publ ic \nauthorities , and it points out that the  CVM has already accepted information provided by Petitioner \nnotwithstanding that it is not a formal participant in the  CVM proceeding.  Respondent disputes \nPetitioner\u2019s characterization and  contends that the right of Brazilian citizens  to petition public \nauthorities is in sufficient, on its own, to render \u201c interested person \u201d status.2   \nI agree with Respondent  that Petitioner has not established that it has sufficient procedural \nrights in the CVM proceeding to qualify as  an \u201cinterested person\u201d  within the meaning of \u00a7 1782.  \nAs Petitioner is not, and has not sought to become, formally recognized as a participant  in that \n2 Respondent also hypothesizes that Petitioner\u2019s true intention is to use the requested \ndiscovery in its private arbitration proceeding, which is not a \u201cforeign or international tribunal\u201d \nfor purposes of \u00a7 1782.   5 proceeding, Petitioner has no participation rights beyond those that  Brazilian law provide s to every \ncitizen.  Unlike in Intel , where the  \u00a7 1782 applicant had \u201ca significant role\u201d in a foreign proceeding  \nthat it had initiated \u2014including the right to submit information  in support of its complaint  and the \nright to seek judicial revie w, 542 U.S. 256\u201357\u2014 here, Petitioner can merely give information to \nthe CVM and hope that the CVM decides to use it.3  That is not enough.  Cf. Certain Funds, \nAccounts and/or Inv. Vehicles v. KPMG, L.L.P. , 798 F.3d 113,  120 (2d Cir. 2015) (\u201c[T]he ability \nsimply to pass on information to parties in a proceeding, without more, cannot confer \u2018 interested  \nperson\u2019 status any more than the ability of amicus counsel to pass along evidence and arguments \nto counsel representing one of the parties in litigation.\u201d).  The fact that Brazilian law bestows upon \nall 250 million of its citizens  the right to provide information to public authorities  does not  \ntransform  \u00a7 1782 into a mechanism for Brazilian shareholders to use U.S. federal courts to conduct \nprivate investigatio ns.  Petitioner is not an \u201cinterested person\u201d under \u00a7 1782.4 \n3 Petitioner asserts that an April 20, 2022 CVM order \u201crecognized Applicant as an \n\u2018interested third party.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 21 at 2; Ex. A.)  Respondent subsequently provided a dueling \ntranslation of that order, which describes Petitioner as a \u201cthird party that is interested in a proceeding.\u201d  (D.I. 22 at 1, Ex. A.)  In any event, the CVM clarified in a May 9, 2022 order that \n\u201cthere was no motion from the [Petitioner] to be included in the Process as an amicus curiae or other form of formal participation,\u201d and referred back to its December 30, 2021 order whi ch \nsimilarly stated that \u201cthere is no formal request by the [Petitioner] to have its hypothetical right to intervene formally in this Case as an interested third party recognized, whether as an assistant, amicus curiae  or under any other form of third part y intervention admitted in the Brazilian legal \nsystem[.]\u201d  (D.I. 23, Ex. A; D.I. 16, Ex. A.)  Thus, regardless of which translation is more  accurate, \nthe legally operative fact is that the CVM has not conferred upon Petitioner any formal legal status or rights beyond the rights provided to every Brazilian citizen who might somehow be affected by \nthe outcome of an administrative proceeding.  \n4 Petitioner has not identified any other \u201creasonable interest in obtaining judicial \nassistance\u201d that, alone or in co mbination with its rights under Brazilian law, qualifies it as an \ninterested person.  Intel , 542 U.S. at 256 (internal marks omitted) .  Petitioner has not, for instance, \nclaimed an agency or other legal relationship with the parties to the CVM proceeding.  See KPMG , \n798 F.3d at 120 (noting that a \u201crecognized relationship, such as that of agent and principal\u201d or creditor and debtor \u201cmay be sufficient to make an otherwise stranger to the proceeding an 6 IV. CONCLUSION\nNOW THEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above , it is HEREBY ORDERED that:  \n1.Respondent\u2019s Motion to Vacate the Court\u2019s O rder and Quash Subpoena s (D.I. 9) is\nGRANTED;\n2.Petitioner\u2019s Ex Parte  Application for an Order to Take Discovery Pursuant to 28 U.S.C .\n\u00a7 1782 (D.I. 1) is DENIED .\n______________________________ \nDate: November 1, 2022 The Honorable Jennifer L.

Id. at 119 n.6 ( rejecting idea that \u201ca mere financial interest confers \u2018interested \nperson\u2019 status under \u00a7 1782\u201d).
