(D.I. 17).  The Government opposes the request. \n(D.I.  18).  For the reasons that follow, the request is DENIED.  \nI. BACKGROUND \n On June 4, 2019, Defendant pleaded guilty to one count  of Theft of Government funds. \n(D.I. 4 ).  The charge arose out of Defendant\u2019s  fraudulent  receipt of Social Security funds on behalf \nof her deceased mother -in-law.  Over the course  of a decade, Ms. Vaughn illegally obtained \napproximately $178,000 from the federal government.  On September 19, 2019, t he Court \nsentenced  her to eighteen (18) months of incarceration followed by three  years of supervised \nrelease.  (D.I. 15) .  Ms. Vaughn\u2019 s supervised release began on  January 15, 2021. ( D.I. 17 ).  A \nyear later, Ms. Vaughn submitted her request to be released from  supervised release \u201ceffective \nimmediately .  (Id.) \nThe only bases for release asserted are, in essence, that she has complied with the \nconditions of release thus far : \nOn January 15, 2022, I completed one (1) full year of supervised \nprobation.  During my supervision I had no violations and I have 2 adhered to all requirements issued by the court. I have made , and will \ncontinue to make, timely restitution payments monthly as  ordered.  \nII. DISCUSSION  \nPursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(l), the Court may terminate a term of supervised release \nafter one year if the Court is \u201c satisfied that such action is warranted by the  conduct of the \ndefendant released and the interest of justice. \u201d  In exercising its discretion, \u00a7 3583(e)(l) directs \nthe Court to consider the\u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.  See also Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1.  \u201cGenerally, \nearly termination of supervised release under\u00a7 3583(e)(l)  should occur only when the sentencing \njudge is satisfied that \u2018 new or unforeseen circumstances \u2019 warrant it. \u201d  United States v. Davies, \n746 Fed. App\u2019 x 86, 89 (3d Cir. 2018)  (unpublished) (citing United States v. Lussier, 104 F.3d 32, \n34-35 (2d Cir. 1997)).  Although \u201cnew or unforeseen circumstan ces\u201d is not a hard and fast \nrequirement to justify early termination of supervised release, because the Court \u2019s sentence was \n\u201csufficient but not greater than necessary\u201d  when imposed, this  Court may exercise its discretion \nto prevent an end- run around its original sentence  unless \u201csomething [has] changed in the interim \nthat would justify an early end to a term  of supervised release. \u201d  United States v. Melvin , 978 F.3d \n49, 53 (3d Cir. 2020) ; cf. Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817, 824 (describing \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as \n\u201ca narrow exception to the rule of finality\u201d ). \nHere, Defendant has not articulated any argument that undercuts this Court \u2019s original \nsentence or the bases for it.  As the government pointed out in its Sentencing Memo ( D.I. 10) , an \n18-month sentence  \u2013 which represented the low end of the  Guidelines  \u2013 was sufficient but not \ngreater than necessary to accomplish the goals of  sentencing.  Not only did the Defendant steal \nfrom the Social Security Administration  (\u201cSSA\u201d) for more than a decade, but she also  lied about \nit repeatedly.  (D.I. 10 at 2 (describing calls  to SSA during which Defendant pretended to be \ndeceased mother -in-law)).  And as the government noted, Ms. Vaughn\u2019 s criminal history  3 \ndemonstrated that she has at times been \u201c undaunt ed by supervised release. \u201d  (D.I. 10 at 3 ( \u201cEach \ntime that Vaughn got caught, she received a sentence of probation.  And each time, she  continued \nto recidivate. \u201d)).  Each of the crimes of which Defendant had been convicted involved stealing \nother  people \u2019s money.  Given Defendant \u2019s criminal history, as well as  her propensity to recidivate  \nand victimize others , she should continue to be supervised by the U.S. Probation Office.   \nSupervision will help keep her  accountable for making her restitution payments  and help to \nprotect others from potential victimization by her.  Her term of supervised release will expire on \nJanuary 14, 2024.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nIn sum, the Court agrees that the conduct underlying Ms. Vaughn\u2019 s conviction was \negregious, longstanding, and offensive.  In light of this and her criminal history, t his Court will \nnot second- guess its original assessment that she  should be supervised for a  term of three years . \nTHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORD ERED that Defendant \u2019s motion for early termination of \nsupervised release (D.I. 17) is DENIED.  \n \n             \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge  "}
