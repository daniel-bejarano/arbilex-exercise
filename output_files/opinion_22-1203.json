NEWMAN,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1203- RGA  \n      : BRITISH PRIME MINISTER FOR  : QUEEN ELIZABETH, et al.   : \n      :        :   Defendant s.   : \n \n Shantell  D. Newman , New Castle , Delaware .  Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                   \n December  14, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Shantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4).  She commenced this action on September 14, \n2022.  (D.I. 2).  T he Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Shorter v. United States , 12 F.4th 366, 374 \n(3d Cir. 2021).  Plaintiff sues Defendant s \u201cBritish Prime Minister for Queen Elizabeth\u201d \nand the United States on the apparent  grounds that she  and her family have suffered \nunspecified injuries  for hundreds of years as a result of events occurring during the \ncolonial  era, the American Revolution, the Civil War , and the era of reconstruction, the \nvestiges of which are felt  to this day .  (D.I. 2 at 6-7).  She asserts , \u201cDelaware must  do \n[its] due diligence to remove itself from the Queen of England and her oppressors ; \nColonial oppressors using \u2018Draconian Law.\u2019\u201d  ( Id. at 7).   She claims , \u201cAll amendment [s] \nhave been violated.\u201d  ( Id. at 9).   For relief, she seeks \u201cfreedom from the crown,  and all \npeople freed from C ommon law and be able to live in peace.\u201d  ( Id.).  \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening  \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2 \n 2013)  (quotation marks omitted); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  \nactions) .  The C ourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take \nthem in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff .  See Phillips v. County of Allegheny , \n515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008) .  Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, h er pleading is \nliberally construed and her  Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less \nstringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 \nU.S. 89, 94 (2007) .  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails t o state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .   Rather, a claim is  deemed \nfrivolous only where it relies  on an \u201c\u2018indisputably meritless legal theory \u2019 or a \u2018 clearly \nbaseless \u2019 or \u2018fantastic or delusional \u2019 factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)  is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provision s of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915, the C ourt must grant \nPlaintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.   \nSee Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014)  (per curiam).  A 3 \n compl aint may not dismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory \nsupporting the claim asserted.  See id. at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead t o state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly  give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -specific task that requi res the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiff\u2019s  Complaint , even when viewed in the light most favorable to her,  is \nfrivolous,  fails to state a claim, and names defendants that  are immune to suit.    \nFirst, my experience and common sense lead me to the conclusion that the \nallegations, to the extent that they can be understood, are legally and factually frivolous .  \nIn other words, they  \u201care so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of \nmerit, . . . wholly insubstantial, . . . obviously frivolous,  . . . plainly unsubstantial, . . . or \nno longer open to discussion.\u201d  Hagans v.  Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 536- 37 (1974) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).   \nSecond, the Complaint\u2019s cla im that  \u201call amendments  have been violated,\u201d in \ncombination with the dearth of factual allegations that would implicate  Plaintiff\u2019s  rights 4 \n under any individual amendment, are insufficient to state a plausible claim  for relief .  \nSee Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 67.     \nFinally , both the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the United States are \nimmune from suit.  See Lafontant v. Aristide, 844 F. Supp. 128, 131- 32 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) \n(\u201cA head- of-state recognized by the United States government is absolutely immune \nfrom personal jurisdiction in United States courts unless that immunity has  been waived \nby statute or by the foreign government recognized by the United States .\u201d); Saltany v. \nReagan, 702 F. Supp. 319, 321 (D.D.C. 1988)  (granting head- of-state immunity to \nPrime Minister of Great Britain ); see also United States v. Mitchell , 463 U.S. 206, 212 \n(1983) (discussing the sovereign immunity of the Unites States); United States v. \nMitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980)  (same).   \nAccordingly, the Complaint will be dismissed.    \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (i), (ii), and (ii i).  Amendment is futile.  \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1203- RGA  \n      : BRITISH PRIME MINISTER FOR  : QUEEN ELIZABETH, et al.   :  \n      : \n  Defendant s.   : \n \nORDER  \n \n At Wilmington this 14th day of  December , 2022 , for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \n IT IS ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSE D pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915( e)(2)(B)(i) , \n(ii), and (iii).  Amendment is futile.  \n2.
