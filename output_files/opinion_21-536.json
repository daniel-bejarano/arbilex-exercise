No. 21-536-CFC\nVALERY LAVERN GREEN, :\n\nDefendant.\n\nRobert Charles Lewis, Howard R. Young Correctional Institution, Wilmington, Delaware.\nPro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDecember 17, 2021\nWilmington, Delaware\nCONNOLLY, hoe\u2019\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Robert Charles Lewis filed this action on April 14, 2021. (D.I. 2) He\nclaims jurisdiction by reason of a federal question. (D.I. 2 at 3) Plaintiff appears pro se\nand has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.|. 4) The Court proceeds\nto review and screen the matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.\n2008). Plaintiff alleges that he was a tenant of Defendant Valery LaVern Green and that\nshe stole his personal property and committed identity theft when she ordered\nmerchandise as Plaintiffs spouse. (D.I. 2 at 3) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant also\ncommitted bank fraud, federal bankruptcy fraud, and terroristic threatening. (/d. at 6)\nPlaintiff alleges the \u201ccrimes are all federal felonies.\u201d (/d. at 4) He seeks compensatory\nand punitive damages. (/d. at 7)\nlll. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a\ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir.\n2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must\n\naccept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most\n\n! Plaintiff is currently held at the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington,\nDelaware. He was not incarcerated when he commenced this action. (See D.1. 2)\nfavorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229\n(3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds\npro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully\npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by\nlawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Weizel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Weizel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Hom, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\n\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\n\n2\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine\nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v.\nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that\nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the\n\n|\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Complaint will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. | have thoroughly\nreviewed the Complaint and it does not raise a federal civil claim for violations of the\nUnited States Constitution or federal statutes. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Nor are the\nparties citizens of different states as is required for diversity jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1332.\n\nMoreover, even if this Court had jurisdiction, to the extent Plaintiff seeks t0\nimpose criminal liability upon Defendant for alleged federal criminal crimes, he lacks\nstanding to proceed. See Allen v. Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, 270 F.\nApp\u2019x 149, 150 (3d Cir. 2008); see United States v. Friedland, 83 F.3d 1531, 1939 (3d\nCir. 1996) (\u2018[T]he United States Attorney is responsible for the prosecution of al criminal\ncases within his or her district.\u201d). The decision of whether to prosecute, and what\ncriminal charges to bring, generally rests with the prosecutor. See United States v.\nBatchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 124 (1979).\n\nThe Complaint will be dismissed. Amendment is futile.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction\n\nand as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nROBERT CHARLES LEWIS,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ. No, 21-536-CFC\nVALERY LAVERN GREEN,\nDefendant.\nORDER\nAt Wilmington, this Seventeenth day of December in 2021, consistent with the\nMemorandum Opinion issued this date,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction and as frivolous\npursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Amendment is futile.\n\n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.\n\n"}
