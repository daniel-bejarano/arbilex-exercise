{"case_name": "In Re: Letter of Request from SPS Corp I", "case_number": "21-565", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "08-30-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nIn re Letter of Request from SPS \nCorp/ 21-mc-00565-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPending before me is an application filed by SPS Corp I -Fundo de \nInvestimento em Direitos Credit6rios Nao Padronizados (SPS) pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a) for authorization to issue subpoenas to General Motors Company \n(GM) and GM's auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte) and Ernst & Young \nLLP (E&Y) (D.I. 1). SPS seeks documents and depositions for use in pending \ndiscovery and contemplated merits proceedings in Brazil related to the recovery of \ncertain tax overpayments from GM' s Brazilian subsidiary, General Motors do \nBrazil LTDA (GM Brazil). D.I. 2 at 1, 9. GM opposes SPS's \u00a7 1782 application, \nD.I. 12, and Deloitte, D.I. 15 at 1, and E&Y, D.I. 16 at 1, join in GM's opposition.1 \n1 Deloitte also asks that I deny SPS 's subpoena because Deloitte possesses \"no \ninformation regarding [GM Brazil] other than what [Deloitte] may have received \nfrom GM.\" D.I. 15 at 2. E&Y similarly explains that \"SPS has failed to identify \nany relevant information in\" or \"uniquely in\" E& Y's possession. D .I. 16 at 1. SPS \ndoes not mention Deloitte or E& Y in its Reply, much less respond to their \narguments. D.I. 28. SPS states in its opening brief that Deloitte and E&Y were \nindependent auditors of GM, D.I. 2 at 10, but it nowhere explains why E&Y or \nDeloitte would have relevant information that GM does not have. Accordingly, I The parties largely agree on how this \u00a7 1782 application arose. In 1989, \nBrazil made a change to its tax code that lowered the taxes GM Brazil had to pay \nto the Brazilian government when it sold new cars to car dealerships. D.I. 2 at 3; \nD.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r 8; D.I. 13 ,r 6. GM Brazil passed these taxes along to the \ndealerships. D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r 10; D.I. 13 ,r 6. But, for a period of time, Brazil \nfailed to charge GM Brazil the new and lower tax rate; GM Brazil and, \nconsequently, the dealerships, paid more than they owed. D.I. 2 at 3; D.I. 2-1, Ex. \nB ,r 11; D.I. 13 ,r 6. GM Brazil, with the consent of the dealerships, initiated a \nlawsuit to recover the tax overpayments. D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r 11; D.I. 13 ,r 7. Once \nthe lawsuit and related administrative proceedings conclude, the parties agree that \nGM Brazil must remit at least some of the refunds it receives from the Brazilian \ngovernment to the dealerships. D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r,r 12-13; D.I. 13 ,r 9. SPS says it \nacquired the rights to receive those refunds from 35 dealerships. D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r \n5. The parties appear to disagree about when GM Brazil must make these \npayments and whether GM Brazil has been forthcoming about certain information \nwill also deny as forfeited SPS's application with respect to Deloitte and E&Y. \nSee In re Seroquel XR Antitrust Litig., 2022 WL 2438934, at* 18 (D. Del. July 5, \n2022) (treating the moving party's \"failure to address [a point nonmovant made] as \nimplicitly conceding the point\" where the moving party's initial treatment of the \nissue was conclusory). \n2 necessary to determine the size of the reimbursements owed to the dealerships \n(and, by extension, to SPS). D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r,r 12-14; D.I. 13 ,r,r 9-10. \nAfter SPS tried and failed to negotiate for additional information with GM \nBrazil directly, SPS initiated a discovery proceeding before the 18th Civil Court of \nthe Central Court of the state of Sao Paulo. D.I. 2 at 5; D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r 30. It is \nundisputed that the purpose of the discovery proceeding is for SPS to obtain \ndocuments from GM Brazil to determine what allegations SPS could properly \nbring in a future merits proceeding. See D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r,r 25-26; D.I. 13 ,r 14. In \nthe Sao Paulo court, SPS seeks from GM Brazil the following materials related to \nthe tax overpayments at issue: ( 1) internal documents related to their collection and \ncalculation; (2) accounting records, audit reports, and related materials; (3) \ninformation about administrative proceedings; and ( 4) information about transfers \nof money between GM Brazil and car dealerships. D.I. 2-1 at 64-65. SPS secured \nan order from the Sao Paulo court for the discovery it seeks, and GM Brazil then \nchallenged SPS's discovery demands. D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r 36. SPS argues that GM \nBrazil's challenge was an improper effort to stonewall the discovery proceedings, \nD.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r 36; GM Brazil disputes that characterization, D.I. 13 ,r 19. \nSPS now turns to this \u00a7 1782 application to \"put an end to\" its ongoing \ndiscovery proceeding, D.I. 2 at 14, and to acquire the evidence needed to \"assess \nits claim or indemnity against [GM Brazil] and ultimately to file its claim ... in \n3 Brazil against [GM Brazil,]\" D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r 40. SPS seeks information from GM \nand GM' s auditors about how GM has treated the tax overpayments at issue in its \nfinancial statements and audit and accounting records. In particular, SPS seeks \nfinancial statements and audit reports from GM and GM Brazil from 1990 to 2021, \nas well as the following information related to the tax overpayments at issue: (1) \ninternal documents and communications; (2) accounting records, audit reports, and \nrelated information; (3) information about administrative proceedings; and ( 4) \ninformation about transfers of money between GM, GM Brazil, and car \ndealerships. D.I. 2-1 at 9-11, 28-29, 46-47. It also seeks deposition testimony on \nthe tax overpayments and their treatment by GM's accountants and auditors. D.I. \n2-1 at 17-19, 35-37, 53-55. GM and its auditors oppose the application. D.I. 12; \nD.I. 15; D.I. 16. \nA district court has the authority to grant an application under \u00a7 1782 when \nthree statutory conditions are met: (1) the person from whom discovery is sought \n\"resides or is found\" within the district; (2) the discovery is \"for use in a \nproceeding before a foreign or international tribunal\"; and (3) the application is \nmade by an \"interested person.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a); see also In re Bayer AG, \n146 F.3d 188, 193 (3d Cir. 1998). See generally ZF Auto. US, Inc. v. Luxshare, \nLtd, 142 S. Ct. 2078, 2089 (2022) ( defining \"foreign or international tribunal\"). \n4 If the statutory conditions are satisfied, the decision to grant a \u00a7 1782 \napplication lies within the district court's discretion. Intel Corp. v. Advanced \nMicro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241,264 (2004). The Court identified in Intel four \nfactors relevant to that discretionary determination: ( 1) whether \"the person from \nwhom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding\" since such a \nperson may possess evidence \"unobtainable absent\u00a7 1782(a) aid\"; (2) \"the nature \nof the foreign tribunal,\" the \"character'' of the foreign proceedings, and \"the \nreceptivity\" of the foreign court to federal \"judicial assistance\"; (3) whether the \nrequest \"conceals an attempt to circumvent .foreign proof-gathering restrictions\"; \nand (4) whether the request is \"unduly intrusive or burdensome.\" Id. at 264-\n65. \"A court should apply these factors in support of\u00a7 1782's 'twin aims' of \n'providing efficient assistance to participants in international litigation and \nencouraging foreign countries by example to provide similar assistance to our \ncourts.\"' In re Biomet Orthopaedics Switzerland GmBh, 742 F. App'x 690, 696 \n(3d Cir. 2018) (quoting Intel, 542 U.S. at 252). The party opposing discovery has \nthe burden to demonstrate any \"'facts warranting the denial\"' of an application. In \nre Chevron Corp., 633 F.3d 153, 162 (3d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). \nHaving considered and balanced the Intel factors and twin aims of\u00a7 1782( a), \nI will deny SPS' s application. Since I would deny SPS 's application under the \n5 discretionary factors, I need not consider whether SPS' s application meets \n\u00a7 1782(a)'s statutory requirements. \nThe first factor weighs in GM' s favor because SPS admits it can obtain the \nevidence it seeks in the discovery proceeding. I agree with SPS that GM is not a \nparticipant in SPS's pending discovery proceeding before the Sao Paulo court. D.I. \n28 at 6. But GM Brazil is a participant. D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,r 30-31. SPS admits that \n\"all financial information concerning the[] tax refunds or credits [that GM Brazil \nowes to SPS are] in the possession of GM Brazil and its financial professionals.\" \nD.I. 2 at 4. And SPS's Brazilian attorney argues both that GM Brazil lacks a \ndefense in the discovery proceeding and that the Sao Paulo court has not denied \nSPS's discovery request. D.I. 28, Ex. A ,r,r 2--6. The Court noted in Intel that \"[a] \nforeign tribunal has jurisdiction over those appearing before it, and can itself order \nthem to produce evidence. In contrast, nonparticipants in the foreign proceeding \nmay be outside the foreign tribunal's jurisdictional reach; hence, their evidence, \navailable in the United States, may be unobtainable absent\u00a7 1782(a) aid.\" 542 \nU.S. at 264 (citations omitted). Here, even if GM's financial statements include \ninformation about the tax overpayments at issue, D.I. 2 at 6, SPS can obtain the \nsame information in the pending foreign court proceeding, see D.I. 28, Ex. A ,r 32 \n( explaining that \"documents that show whether and how GM Brazil has taken tax \nadvantages of [the tax overpayments at issue]\" are \"requested [from] GM Brazil\" \n6 in Brazil and \"are requested from different entities\" in this Court). Since much of \nthe evidence SPS demands is not \"evidence ... unobtainable absent\u00a7 1782(a) \naid[,]\" Intel, 542 U.S. at 264, the first Intel factor favors GM. \nThe second Intel factor instructs me to consider the \"character\" of the \nforeign proceeding and the receptivity of the foreign tribunal to the discovery SPS \nseeks. This factor also favors GM. SPS describes its pending proceeding as \"a \npreliminary discovery lawsuit\" and \"a mechanism that allows litigants in Brazil to \ngather evidence against potential defendants .... \" D .I. 2 at 5. Both respect for the \nSao Paulo court and the goal of efficient litigation caution that I should wait until \nthe pending discovery proceeding concludes. Biomet Orthopaedics, 742 F. App'x \nat 696 (quoting Intel, 542 U.S. at 252) (explaining that the '\"twin aims\"' of\u00a7 \n1782(a) are \"'providing efficient assistance\"' and \"'encouraging ... similar \nassistance\"' from foreign countries). Otherwise, the Sao Paulo court may not be \nreceptive to the discovery I order, or I may duplicate that tribunal's efforts. See \nD.I. 12 at 23 (arguing that the foreign court's receptivity to what SPS seeks here is \nspeculative \" [ u ]ntil the Brazilian court decides whether the discovery SPS seeks \n[there] is appropriate\"). \nThe Third Intel factor-whether SPS \"attempt[ s] to circumvent foreign \nproof-gathering restrictions\"-is neutral, at least for now. 542 U.S. at 265. The \nsubstantial overlap between the information SPS now seeks from GM and already \n7 sought from GM Brazil leaves SPS in a bind: If SPS overcomes GM Brazil's \nchallenge to its discovery demands in the Sao Paulo court, D.I. 2-1, Ex. B ,I 36, \nSPS' s request to GM before me would largely duplicate the discovery it receives \nfrom GM Brazil; as a result, the first Intel factor would weigh further against SPS. \nBut, if the Sao Paulo court rules in favor of GM Brazil, any discovery I provide \nwould likely \"circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions[,]\" Intel, 542 U.S. at \n265, because \"the foreign tribunal has already rejected requests for the same \ndocuments[,]\" In re Ex Parte Application of Eni S.p.A., 2021 WL 1063390, at *4 \n(D. Del. Mar. 19, 2021) (citing Chevron Corp., 633 F.3d at 163). But see Intel, \n542 U.S. at 260 (finding no \"blanket foreign-discoverability rule\" for\u00a7 1782(a) \nassistance). SPS asserts that the Sao Paulo court has not rejected its discovery \nrequests. D.I. 28 at 2. For now, I will accept SPS's assertion and find this factor \nneutral. \nWith respect to the final factor, I assume without deciding that the request is \nnot unduly burdensome and therefore this factor favors SPS. Some of SPS 's \ndocument requests seek information far beyond the scope of this narrow dispute \nabout tax overpayments. See D.I. 2-1 at 11 (\"All documents and communications \nconcerning audit reports and related documents .... \"), 29 (same), 47 (same). But \nI may be able strike those requests, narrow the subpoenas, and eliminate the undue \nburden. \n8 Thus, the balance of the Intel factors favors GM. Moreover, the aims of \n\u00a7 1782 would not be served by granting the application. SPS seeks to \"put an end \nto\" its ongoing discovery proceeding, D.I. 2 at 14, but that is not\u00a7 1782(a)'s role. \nSection l 782(a) helps parties obtain discovery in the United States, where foreign \ntribunals lack jurisdiction . See Intel, 542 U.S. at 264 (noting that evidence from \n\"nonparticipants in foreign proceedings ... may be unobtainable absent\u00a7 1782(a) \naid\"). SPS admits that it seeks largely the same information here and before the \nSao Paulo court. See D.I. 2 at 4. And a comparison of what SPS seeks here, D.I. \n2-1 at 9-11 (seeking, e.g., audit reports, accounting records, and information about \nadministrative proceedings related to the tax overpayments at issue), and there, D.I. \n2-1 at 65 (seeking, e.g., audit reports, accounting records, and information about \nadministrative proceedings related to the same tax overpayments), bolsters that \nconclusion. \nNOW THEREFORE, for these reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nSPS's Application for an Order Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 Permitting SPS to Issue a \nSubpoena for the Taking of a Deposition and the Production of Documents from \nGM, Deloitte and E&Y (D.I. 1) is DENIED . \n9 "}
