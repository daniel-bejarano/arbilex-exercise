{"case_name": "Pourbabai v. Duff", "case_number": "21-92", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "01-21-2022", "ocr_text": "1 \n  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \n \n FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nBEN POURBABAI ,    : \n: \n  Plaintiff,    : \n: \nv. : Civ. No. 21 -092-RGA  \n: \nDAVID DUFF ,    : \n: \nDefendant.    : \n \nMEMORANDUM  \n1. Introduction.  Plaintiff proceeds pro se and sought leave to proceed in \nforma pauperis .  (D.I. 1).  On February 3, 2021, the Court denied the motion and \nordered Plaintiff to pay the filing fee.  (D.I. 5).  On March 11, 2021,  the Court \ndismissed this action without prejudice for Plaintiff\u2019s failure pay the required filing fee.  \n(D.I. 6).   \n2. Reconsideration .  Plaintiff Ben Pourbabai moves for reconsideration of \nthe dismissal order .  (D.I. 7).  The Court will grant the motion for reconsideration and \nwill vacate the orders deny Plaintiff leave to proceed in forma pauperis  and dismissing \nthe case.  (D.I. 5, 6).  The Court will also grant Plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperi s.  (D.I. 1). \n3. Venue .  Plaintiff who r esides in Delaware, brings this action for legal \nmalpractice against his former attorney, a Virginia resident , for representation in a \ndivorce proceeding in the Virginia courts .  (D.I. 2).  Plaintiff asserts jurisdiction by \nreason of diversity of the parties.  ( Id.).  The court may transfer a case \u201c [f]or the 2 \n convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, . . . to any other district \nor division where it might have been brought.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).  The Court may \nraise venue and issue a Section 1404(a) transfer order sua sponte.  See e.g., Amica \nMut. Ins. Co. v. Fogel , 656 F.3d 167 (3d Cir. 2011).    \n4. Section 1404(a) states: \u201cFor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in \nthe interest of  justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or \ndivision where it might have been brought  . . . .\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).   In determining \nwhether transfer is appropriate, courts typically engage in a multi -factor balancing test \nwhereby they consider the private and public interests at stake. Id.  Private interest \nfactors considered by the Court include: (1) plaintiff \u2019s forum preference as reflected by \nthe initial filing; (2) defendant \u2019s preference; (3) whether the claim arose elsewhere; (4) \nthe convenience of the parties as indicated by their relative physical and financial \nsituations; (5) the convenience of the witness es to the extent that witnesses might be \nunavailable for trial in either fora; and (6) the location of books and records.   Jumara v. \nState Farm Ins. Co ., 55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995)  (citations omitted).   There are also \npublic interest factors, but other than the greater familiarity a Virginia federal court would have with Virginia malpractice law and the operation of the Virginia state courts, I do not \nrely upon them.  \n5. Here, it does not appear that any of the events or omissions giving rise to \nPlaintiff\u2019 s claims occurred in Delaware.  Clearly, they are alleged to have occurred in \nVirginia.   The only reason the suit is filed in Delaware is that is where Plaintiff now \nresides.  In addition, the claims all arise under Virginia law  and judges there are mor e 3 \n familiar with Virginia law.  Finally, Defendant resides in Virginia, his law practice is \nlocated there where presumably he has records of the matter of which Plaintiff \ncomplains.   (There is no allegation in the complaint that there is personal jurisdicti on \nover Defendant  in Delaware.). The Court considers the allegations in the Complaint and \nfinds the interests of justice favor transferring the action to the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern of Virginia , where Defendant  and records are located , and, based \nupon the allegations , it appears all relevant  events took place.  \n6. Miscellaneous Motions .  Plaintiff\u2019s motion for continuance and motion \nrequesting free access to electronic filing system will be dismissed as moot.  \n7. Conclusion.  For the above reasons  the Court will: (1) grant Plaintiff\u2019s \nmotion for reconsideration (D.I. 7); (2) vacate the orders deny Plaintiff leave to proceed \nin forma pauperis and dismissing the case  (D.I. 5, 6) ; (3) grant Plaintiff\u2019s motion for \nleave to proceed in forma  pauperis  (D.I. 1) ; (4) dismiss as moot Plaintiff\u2019s  motion for \ncontinuance and motion requesting free access to electronic filing system  (D.I. 8, 9); \nand (5) direct the Clerk of Court  to transfer this action to the United States District Court \nfor the East ern District of Virginia.   A separate order shall issue.  \n \n \n  _/s/ Richard G.
