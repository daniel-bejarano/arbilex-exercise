MEADES,\n\nPetitioner,\n\u00a5. : Civil Action No. 20-229-RGA\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\nRespondents.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nRobert R. Meades. Pro se Petitioner.\n\nMatthew C. Bloom, Deputy Attorney General of the Delaware Department of Justice,\nWilmington, Delaware. Attorney for Respondents.\n\nAugust 2, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nANDREWS, AG. STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPetitioner Robert R. Meades is an inmate in custody at the James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center in Smyrna, Delaware. Petitioner filed an Application for a Writ of Habeas\nCorpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d). (D.I. 3) The State filed a Motion to Dismiss\nthe Petition as time-barred. (D.I. 23) Petitioner filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (D.1. 20)\nand a Motion to Amend (D.I. 21), which the Court construes to be Petitioner\u2019s Response in\nopposition. (See D.I. 22). For the reasons discussed, the Court will grant the State\u2019s Motion to\nDismiss, and deny the Petition as barred by the limitations period prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2244.\n\nIL BACKGROUND\n\nOn January 29, 2011, Petitioner robbed a bank in Millsboro, Delaware. (D.I. 17-3 at 2)\nVideo surveillance showed Petitioner confronting two bank tellers while brandishing a knife.\n(d.) Petitioner was apprehended while fleeing the robbery in his car, and the knife was found in\nhis pocket. (/d.) A subsequent search of his car revealed the gloves worn in the robbery, covered\nwith red paint from the exploded dye pack in the money bag taken from the bank. (/d.) After\nbeing advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), Petitioner confessed\nto committing the robbery and brandishing a knife while confronting two tellers. (/d.)\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Petitioner pled guilty to two counts of first degree robbery and one\ncount of possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony (\u201c\u201cPDWDCF\u201d). (D.I.\n23 at 1) The Delaware Superior Court sentenced Petitioner on March 9, 2012 to a cumulative\nsentence of seventy-five years in prison, suspended after seventy years for five years of\n\nprobation. (D.I. 17-14 at 13-14) Petitioner did not appeal his convictions or sentences.\nOn January 31, 2013, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court a motion for postconviction\nrelief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d), alleging that:\n(1) the Superior Court failed to conduct a proper competency inquiry and accepted Petitioner\u2019s\nguilty plea while he was under the influence of psychiatric medication; and (2) defense counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance by permitting Petitioner to enter a guilty plea while he was under\nthe influence of psychiatric medicine. (D.I. 17-12 at 5-6; D.L. 17-14) The Superior Court\nrequested and received an affidavit in response from Petitioner\u2019s defense counsel. (See D.I. 17-\n13) The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion on April 29, 2013, (D.I. 17-14), and\nPetitioner did not appeal that decision.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, Petitioner filed a second Rule 61 motion, alleging: (1) his guilty\nplea was involuntary because he was under the influence of psychiatric medication when he\nentered the plea and because of his lifelong struggle with addiction; (2) his attorney was\nineffective because she knew Petitioner could not comprehend anything; (3) the Superior Court\nviolated his due process rights by permitting him to enter a guilty plea while mentally\nincompetent; and (4) the fact that Petitioner was incompetent when he confessed rendered his\nconfession involuntary. (D.I. 17-17; 17-18 at 1-2) The Superior Court summarily dismissed the\nsecond Rule 61 motion under Rule 61(i), explaining that the motion \u201ccomes too late; [] is\nrepetitive; [] raises issues previously adjudicated; and [] does not address why the confession\nissues were not raised in [Petitioner\u2019s] first motion.\u201d (D.I. 17-18 at 2-3) Petitioner did not\nappeal that decision.\n\nPetitioner filed a third Rule 61 motion on June 7, 2019, alleging that: (1) the Superior\n\nCourt failed to conduct a competency hearing to determine whether Petitioner knowingly pled\nguilty; and (2) Petitioner was incompetent at all relevant times, as evidenced by his treatment and\nstay at the Delaware Psychiatric Center. (D.I. 17-25) The Superior Court summarily dismissed\nthe third Rule 61 motion on August 26, 2019 as successive under Rule 61(d)(2), because\nPetitioner was convicted after entering a guilty plea and not after a trial. (D.I. 17-26 at 2); State v.\nMeades, 2019 WL 4034352, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 26, 2019). The Delaware Supreme\nCourt affirmed that decision. See Meades v. State, 223 A.3d 416 (Table), 2019 WL 6358701\n(Del. Nov. 26, 2019).\n\nPetitioner filed the instant Petition in February 2020, which asserts the following grounds\nfor relief: (1) Petitioner did not knowingly and voluntarily enter a guilty plea because he was\nhoused at the Delaware Psychiatric Center and under the influence of psychiatric medication\nduring his plea colloquy; (2) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by \u201cpermitting and\ncontinuously advising [Petitioner] to plea[d] guilty while [he] was in a medicated state of mind\u201d\n(DI. 3 at 8); and (3) the Delaware Superior Court did not conduct a competency hearing to\ndetermine \u201cPetitioner\u2019s psychological state of mind or if he completely understood the court\nprocess\u201d (/d. at 10). The State filed a Motion for Leave to File a Motion to Dismiss. (D.I. 16)\n\nIn response, Petitioner filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (D.I. 20) and a Motion to Amend\nMotion for Summary Judgment (D.I. 21). Based on the assertions contained therein, the Court\nconstrued Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion to Amend Motion for\nSummary Judgment as a Response in Opposition, and granted the State permission to file the\n\nMotion to Dismiss.! (D.J. 22) The State\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is ready for review.\n\n'Petitioner has filed a Notice of Appeal from the Court\u2019s Order granting the State permission to\nfile a Motion to Dismiss, and the appeal is still pending before the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit. (D.I. 24) Petitioner\u2019s pending appeal does not divest the Court of jurisdiction to review\nthe instant Petition pending before the Court; the Court\u2019s order granting the State permission to\n\n3\nIL. ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\nAEDPA prescribes a one-year period of limitations for the filing of habeas petitions by\n\nstate prisoners, which begins to run from the latest of:\n\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion\n\nof direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such\n\nreview;\n\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application\n\ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of\n\nthe United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from\n\nfiling by such State action;\n\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially\n\nrecognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly\n\nrecognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively\n\napplicable to cases on collateral review; or\n\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims\n\npresented could have been discovered through the exercise of due\n\ndiligence.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling.\nSee Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2)\n(statutory tolling). A petitioner may also be excused from failing to comply with the limitations\nperiod by making a gateway showing of actual innocence. See Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F.4\u2122 133,\n151 (3d Cir. 2021).\n\nPetitioner does not assert, and the Court cannot discern, any facts triggering the\n\napplication of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B),(C), or (D). Therefore, the one-year period of limitations began to\n\nrun when Petitioner\u2019s conviction became final under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\n\nfile its Motion to Dismiss is not a final or appealable collateral order. See Christy v. Horn, 115\nF.3d 201, 203-04 (3d Cir. 1997); see also In re Glenn W. Turner Enters. Litig., 521 F.2d 775,\n781 (3d Cir. 1975) (holding that interlocutory orders are not immediately appealable); Stephens\nv, Muncy, 918 F.2d 174 (4\" Cir. 1990) (dismissing appeal of order granting leave to file motion\nto dismiss).\n\n4\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if. state prisoner does not appeal a state court judgment, the\njudgment of conviction becomes final, and the statute of limitations begins to run upon\nexpiration of the time period allowed for seeking direct review. See Kapral v. United States, 166\nF.3d 565, 575, 578 (3d Cir. 1999). In this case, the Superior Court sentenced Petitioner on\nMarch 9, 2012. Since Petitioner did not appeal that judgment, his conviction became final on\nApril 9, 2012, when the time to appeal expired.\u201d Applying the one-year limitations period to that\ndate, Petitioner had until April 9, 2013, to timely file a habeas petition. See Wilson v. Beard, 426\nF.3d 653, 662-64 (3d Cir, 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period);\nPhlipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA\u2019s one-year\nlimitations period is calculated according to the anniversary method, i.e., the limitations period\nexpires on the anniversary of the date it began to run). Petitioner, however, did not file the\ninstant Petition until February 18, 2020,? almost a full seven years after that deadline. Thus, the\nPetition is time-barred and should be dismissed, unless the limitations period can be statutorily or\nequitably tolled, or Petitioner demonstrates a convincing claim of actual innocence excusing his\n\nuntimely filing. The Court will discuss each doctrine in turn.\n\n2The thirty-day appeal period actually expired on April 8, 2012, which was a Sunday. Therefore,\nthe appeal period extended through the end of the day on April 9, 2012. See Del. Sup. Ct. R.\n11(a).\n\n3Pursuant to the prison mailbox rule, a pro se prisoner\u2019s habeas petition is deemed filed on the\ndate he delivers it to prison officials for mailing. See Longenette v. Krusing, 322 F.3d 758, 761\n(3d Cir. 2003) (the date on which a prisoner transmitted documents to prison authorities for\nmailing is to be considered the actual filing date). Therefore, the Court adopts February 18, 2020\nas the date of filing, since that is the date on the Petition and also the date on which the Petition\nwas electronically filed.\n\n5\nA. Statutory Tolling\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls AEDPA\u2019s\nlimitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, including any post-\nconviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). The\nlimitations period is also tolled for the time during which an appeal from a post-conviction\ndecision could be filed even if the appeal is not eventually filed. Id. at 424. The limitations\nperiod, however, is not tolled for the ninety-day period during which a petitioner may file a\npetition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state\npost-conviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist. Att'y of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d Cir.\n2001).\n\nThe limitations clock in this case started to run on April 10, 2012, and ran for 296 days\nuntil Petitioner filed his first Rule 61 motion on January 31,2013. The Superior Court denied\nthe Rule 61 motion on April 29, 2013, and Petitioner did not appeal that decision.\nConsequently, the first Rule 61 motion tolled the limitations period from January 31, 2013\nthrough May 29, 2013, which includes the thirty-day appeal period.\n\nThe limitations clock started to run again on May 30, 2013, and ran the remaining sixty-\nnine days without interruption until the limitations period expired on August 7, 2013.\nPetitioner\u2019s second and third Rule 61 motions do not statutorily toll the limitations period,\nbecause both motions were filed after August 7, 2013. Accordingly, the instant Petition is time-\nbarred, unless equitable tolling applies or Petitioner establishes a gateway claim of actual\n\ninnocence.\nB. Equitable Tolling\n\nThe one-year limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in rare circumstances\nwhen the petitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that\nsome extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d Holland, 560\nUSS. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the\nlate filing is due to the petitioner\u2019s excusable neglect. Jd. at 651-52. As for the extraordinary\ncircumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged to be\nextraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to\nmeeting AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline.\u201d Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011).\nNotably, an extraordinary circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if there is \u201ca causal\nconnection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner\u2019s failure to\nfile a timely federal petition.\u201d Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013).\n\nPetitioner asserts that the limitations period should be equitably tolled under Martinez v.\nRyan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012) because the Superior Court did not appoint counsel to represent him in\nhis first Rule 61 proceeding. (D.I. 3 at 15) This argument is unavailing. By its own terms, the\nMartinez decision provides a petitioner with an opportunity to overcome a procedural default of\nan ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, but does not in any way impact a petitioner\u2019s\nobligation to comply with AEDPA\u2019s limitations period. Additionally, a petitioner\u2019s pro se status\ndoes not constitute extraordinary circumstances for equitable tolling. See Ross, 712 F.3d at 799-\n800.\n\nPetitioner does not assert that any other alleged extraordinary circumstance prevented\n\nhim from timely filing the instant Petition. Notably, Petitioner\u2019s allegations about his mental\n\nillness and alleged incompetency focus on the time at which he entered his guilty plea.\nPetitioner does not assert that his mental illness, legal incompetence, or past custody in the\nDelaware Psychiatric Center prevented him from complying with AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations\n_ period.* To the extent Petitioner\u2019s late filing was due to a mistake or miscalculation of the one-\nyear filing period, such a mistake does not warrant equitably tolling the limitations period. See\nTaylor y. Carroll, 2004 WL 1151552, at *5-6 (D. Del. May 14, 2004). Thus, the Court\nconcludes that the doctrine of equitable tolling is not available to Petitioner on the facts he has\npresented.\n\nC. Actual Innocence\n\nA credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable exception\u201d that can\novercome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. See McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S\n383, 392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F.Ath at 150-51. A petitioner satisfies the actual innocence\nexception by (1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his innocence; and (2) showing \u201cby a\npreponderance of the evidence\u201d that \u201ca reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt about his\nguilt[] in light of the new evidence.\u201d Wallace, 2 F.4\" at 151. The Supreme Court and the Third\nCircuit have not defined \u201cnew evidence\u201d in the context of the actual innocence gateway.\nAlthough the Third Circuit has \u201csuggested that new evidence generally must be newly\ndiscovered\u201d and \u201cunknown to the defense at the time of trial,\u201d this definition of \u201cnew evidence\u201d\ndoes not apply when the \u201cunderlying constitutional violation claimed is ineffective assistance of\ncounsel premised on a failure to present such evidence.\u201d Reeves v. Fayette SCI, 897 F.3d 154,\n\u201cIn contrast, Petitioner\u2019s third Rule 61 motion alleged that Petitioner\u2019s continued medicated state\naffected his ability to pursue his state collateral motions in a timely manner. (D.I. 17-25 at 4)\nThe Court notes, however, that Petitioner, acting pro se, did actually file a timely first Rule 61\n\nmotion (See D.I. 17-14 at 1), and his third Rule 61 motion was summarily dismissed as\nsuccessive under Rule 61(d)(2), not for being time-barred. (See D.I. 17-14 at 1; D.L 17-26)\n8\n164 (3d Cir. 2018). Instead, \u201cwhen a petitioner asserts ineffective assistance of counsel based on\ncounsel\u2019s failure to discover or present to the fact-finder the very exculpatory evidence that\ndemonstrates his actual innocence, such evidence constitutes new evidence for purposes of the\nSchlup actual innocence gateway.\u201d Id.\n\nIn this case, Petitioner does not allege that he is actually innocent. To the extent the\nCourt should construe Petitioner\u2019s argument that he was mentally ill and incompetent to enter a\nguilty plea at the time of his plea colloquy as a convoluted attempt to trigger the actual-\ninnocence equitable exception to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period, his attempt is unavailing. Courts\nthat have considered the issue have found that a petitioner\u2019s allegation of incompetency to enter\na guilty plea does not state a claim of actual innocence for purposes of the actual innocence\ngateway exception, because a petitioner\u2019s mental state at the time of a guilty plea does not bear\non his mental state at the time of the crime. See Williams v. Covello, 2021 WL 6551280, at *7 n.\n7 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2021) (collecting cases). Thus, the Court concludes that Petitioner has not\npresented a convincing gateway claim of actual innocence sufficient to excuse his untimely\nfiling.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the Petition as time-barred.\nIV. PENDING MOTION\n\nPetitioner filed a second Motion for the Appointment of Counsel (D.I. 19) after the Court\ndenied his first request for counsel. (D.I. 5; D.I. 8) Having determined that Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254\nPetition should be dismissed as time-barred, the Court will dismiss as moot his Motion for the\nAppointment of Counsel.\n\nV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether\nto issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).\nWhen a district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the\nunderlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability\nunless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the\npetition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was\ncorrect in its procedural ruling. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court concludes that the instant Petition is time-barred. In the Court\u2019s view,\nreasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Therefore, the Court will not\nissue a certificate of appealability.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will grant the State\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and dismiss\n\nthe Petition as time-barred. Additionally, the Court will dismiss as moot Petitioner\u2019s Motion for\n\nthe Appointment of Counsel. An appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n10\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nROBERT R.
