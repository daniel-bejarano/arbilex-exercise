No. 21-170-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiffs' Motion for An Order Authorizing the Issuance of a Writ of \nAttachment Fieri Facias (D.1. 2) is DENIED as it was not filed by counsel \nauthorized to practice before the Court. The Clerk's Office inadvertently allowed \nMr. Ford to make electronic filings. Although Mr. Ford is a member of this \nCourt's bar, he does not have a Delaware office and he is therefore not authorized \nto make filings with the Court unless and until the Court has approved an \napplication made by him under Local Rule 83.5(f)(2). \nFurther, given the nature of this case, the Court does not believe that \nexceptional circumstances exist to justify approving an application by Mr. Ford Case 1:21-mc-00170-CFC   Document 7   Filed 05/12/22   Page 1 of 2 PageID #: 237under Local Rule 83.5(f)(2).1 Accordingly, if Plaintiffs wish to pursue this matter \nin this Court (as opposed to the District of Connecticut, which appears to be the \nappropriate forum where Plaintiffs should seek the relief requested in their \nmotion), Plaintiffs need to retain a Delaware lawyer with a Delaware office. \nS, /2-\u00b7 2Z.. \nDate Chief Judge \n1 Plaintiffs, for example, are not government agencies; nor do they appear to suffer \nfrom financial hardship. \n2 Case 1:21-mc-00170-CFC   Document 7   Filed 05/12/22   Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 238"}
