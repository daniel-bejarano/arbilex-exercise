KRISHNA P. \nSINGH, KAPEX I, LLC, and \nMULTI-DECADES TRUST, \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMICRON DEVICES, LLC, \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 20-1706-CFC \nMichael I. Silverman, SILVERMAN MCDONALD & FRIEDMAN, Wilmington, \nDelaware; David A. Berlin, Matthew B. Weisberg, WEISBERG LAW, Morton, \nPennsylvania \nCounsel for Plaintiffs \nApril 5, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION C0LM.C0NNOLL Y \nCHIEF JUDGE \nPlaintiffs brought this breach-of-contract lawsuit based on diversity \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. See D.I. 1. The Third Circuit has held that \n\"the citizenship of an LLC is determined by the citizenship of each of its \nmembers.\" Zambelli Fireworks Mfg. Co. v. Wood, 592 F.3d 412,418 (3d Cir. \n2010). Because I \"have an independent obligation to determine whether subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party,\" \nArbaugh v. Y &H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006), I ordered Plaintiffs to identify \nthe name and citizenship of each member of the limited partnership and LLC \nparties. D.I. 24. \nConsistent with their complaint, Plaintiffs identified Florida as the \ncitizenship of the members of the plaintiff entities. D.I. 25. They also identified \nLaura Perryman as a member of Defendant Micron Devices, LLC and they say that \nshe too is a citizen of Florida. D.I. 26. This Court therefore lacks diversity \njurisdiction over this action. See Dev. Fin. Corp. v. Alpha Haus. & Health Care, \nInc., 54 F.3d 156, 158 (3d Cir. 1995) (\"It is axiomatic that the federal judiciary's \ndiversity jurisdiction depends on complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all \ndefendants .\"). Accordingly, I will dismiss the case for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction. "}
