{"case_name": "Cybrary, Inc. v. Learningwise Education Inc.", "case_number": "22-500", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "02-06-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nCYBRARY, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nLEARNINGWISE EDUCATION \nINC. d/b/a UNIVERSITY \nCANADA WEST, \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 22-500-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff Cybrary, Inc. (Cybrary) filed this diversity action against Defendant \nLearningwise Education Inc. d/b/a University Canada West (UCW) for breach of \ncontract. D.I. 1 ,r,r 51-59. Before me is UCW's motion to dismiss Cybrary's \nComplaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6). D.I. 7. \nI. BACKGROUND \nBecause I am considering the merits of a Rule 12(b )( 6) motion, the \nfollowing facts and background information, except where noted otherwise, are \ntaken from the Complaint and from documents relied upon in the Complaint and are assumed to be true. See Mgmt. Sci. Assocs. v. Datavant, Inc., 510 F. Supp. 3d \n238, 244 (D. Del. 2020). \nA. The Parties \nCybrary is a company that offers cybersecurity and IT training. D.I. 1 ,I 11. \nIts online course offerings include \"cloud security, offensive and defensive \nsecurity, risk-management compliance, scripting, coding, and cybersecurity \nmanagement.\" D.I. 1 ,I 11. Cybrary categorizes its course offerings into two \ngroups: (1) \"Cybrary for Individuals\" and (2) \"Cybrary for Teams.\" D.I. 1 ,I 15. \n\"Cybrary for Individuals is aimed at training and certifying cybersecurity \nprofessionals,\" D.I. 1 ,I 16; Cybrary for Teams \"incorporates the course offerings \nin Cybrary for Individuals but adds a layer of administrative oversight that allows \nbusiness leadership to accurately assess its cybersecurity readiness,\" D.I. 1 ,I 17. \nCybrary for Teams can be purchased in either \"Essentials\" or \"Enterprise\" \npackages. D.I. 1 ,I 19. \nCybrary sells these course packages on a subscription basis. D.I. 1 ,I 20. \nWhile Cybrary for Individuals has free and paid versions, both Cybrary for Teams \nofferings require paid subscriptions. D.I. 1 ,I 20. A user can subscribe to Cybrary \nfor Individuals and Cybrary for Teams \"Essentials\" directly through Cybrary's \nwebsite, but a customer can subscribe to Cybrary for Teams \"Enterprise\" only by \nspeaking with Cybrary's sales team. D.I. 1 ,I 20. \n2 \"UCW is a private, for-profit university located in Vancouver, Canada.\" \nD.I. 1 ,r 21. Its course offerings include three undergraduate degree programs and \na Masters of Business Administration program. D.I. 1 ,r 22. \nB. The Contract Dispute \nIn 2021, UCW and Cybrary began negotiating a potential UCW subscription \nto Cybrary's Cybrary for Teams Enterprise package. D.I. 1 ,r 22. On August 11, \n2021, Cybrary forwarded \"Order Form 13502\" (Order 13502) to UCW. D.I. 1 \n,r 22. Under Order 13502, Cybrary would purchase 3,000 Cybrary for Teams \nEnterprise licenses for three one-year terms. D.I. 8-1 at 2. Cybrary would pay \n$200 per license per year, for a total yearly payment of $600,000 and $1,800,000 \nover the three-year term. D.I. 8-1 at 2. Order 13502 also includes a number of \nterms and conditions ( e.g., definitions, payment and order conditions, etc.). D.I. 8-\n1 at 4-16. The listed \"pricing expiration date\" is August 30, 2021; listed service \nstart date is September 1, 2021; and listed service end date is August 31, 2024. \nD.I. 8-1 at 2-3. \nUCW never signed or returned Order 13502. But, the parties signed a \nLicensing Agreement on August 30, 2021. D.I. 8-1, Ex. B. The parties amended \nthe Licensing Agreement on September 16, 2021. D.I. 8-1 at 39. The amendment \nconsisted primarily of slight changes to the Licensing Agreement's subscription \nterm and payment schedule. D.I. 8-1 at 39. \n3 UCW has not executed any additional purchase orders or paid Cybrary for \nany subscriptions. D.I. 1 ,r 57. According to Cybrary's complaint, the Licensing \nAgreement and its amendment were signed by UCW's then-President, Brock \nDykeman. D.I. 1 ,r,r 34, 40. But, on September 22, 2021-after the Licensing \nAgreement and its amendment were both signed-Dykeman announced his \nretirement. D .I. 1 ,r 41. U CW then appointed an interim president, Sheldon Levy. \nD.I. 1 ,r 41. In November 2021, UCW told Cybrary that it \"wished to terminate the \nLicensing Agreement.\" D.I. 1 ,r 42. Cybrary considered this a unilateral breach, \nbut UCW \"disputed that it had any obligation under the contract.\" D.I. 1 ,r 43. \nStill, on January 20, 2022, Cybrary sent UCW an invoice. D.I. 1 ,r 44; D.I. 1-1, Ex. \nE. UCW responded that it would not pay the invoice because there was no \ncontract. D.I. 1-1, Ex. F. This suit followed. \nII. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \nCybrary is incorporated in Delaware, and its principal place of business is in \nMaryland. D.I. 1 ,r 4. UCW is incorporated in Canada, and its principal place of \nbusiness is in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. D.I. 1 ,r 5. In this state law \nbreach of contract action, Cybrary seeks damages for UCW' s breach of the \nLicensing Agreement. D.I. 1 at 12. Cybrary alleges that the Licensing Agreement \nincorporates Order 13502, so it requires UCW purchase 3,000 licenses at $200 per \nlicense per year, for a total yearly payment of $600,000 and $1,800,000 over three \n4 years. D.I. 8-1 at 2. Thus, because complete diversity exists and the amount-in\u00ad\ncontroversy exceeds $75,000, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 \nu.s.c. \u00a7 1332. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA district court \"may grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b )( 6) if, accepting all well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable \nto the plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Ballentine v. United States, 486 \nF .3d 806, 810 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To \nstate a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the complaint \nmust include more than mere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of \nthe elements of a cause of action.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 \n(2007) ( citation omitted). The complaint must set forth enough facts, accepted as \ntrue, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Id. at 570. A claim is \nfacially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ( citation omitted). Deciding \nwhether a claim is plausible is a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing \n5 court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id at 679 ( citation \nomitted). \nIn addition to the allegations contained in the complaint, courts also consider \n\"exhibits attached to the complaint\" when deciding a motion to dismiss. Pension \nBen. Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. \n1993). \nIV. DISCUSSION \n\"In order to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a breach of \ncontract claim, a plaintiff must establish ( 1) the existence of a contract; (2) breach \nof an obligation imposed by the contract; and (3) resulting damage to the plaintiff.\" \nMicro Focus (US), Inc. v. Insurance Servs. Office, Inc., 125 F. Supp. 3d 497, 500 \n(D. Del. 2015) (citing VLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 840 A.2d 606, \n612 (Del. 2003) ). \nBecause this is a diversity case involving state law, I must apply Delaware \ncontract interpretation law. \"Delaware adheres to an objective theory of contracts, \nmeaning that a contract's construction should be that which would be understood \nby an objective, reasonable third party.\" Cox Commc'ns., Inc. v. T-Moible US, \nInc., 273 A.3d 752, 760 (Del. 2022) (citing Osborn ex rel. Osborn v. Kemp, 991 \nA.2d 1153, 1159 (Del. 2010)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"This approach \nplaces great weight on the [contract's] plain terms,\" and courts \"interpret clear and \n6 unambiguous terms according to their ordinary meaning.\" Id. (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted). \n\"Ambiguity is present only when the provisions in controversy are \nreasonably or fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or \nmore different meanings.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But \n\"the trial court cannot choose between two differing reasonable interpretations of \nambiguous provisions.\" VLIW, 840 A.2d at 615. Rather, \"[d]ismissal, pursuant to \nRule l 2(b )( 6), is proper only if the defendant[' s] interpretation is the only \nreasonable construction as a matter of law.\" Id. (emphasis in original). \nThe parties dispute whether the Licensing Agreement incorporates Order \n13502. Cybrary argues that the Order is incorporated into the Licensing \nAgreement, thus creating an enforceable contract that UCW has now breached. \nD.I. 1 ,r,r 29, 51-54. UCW claims the reverse-the Licensing Agreement requires \na signed and returned purchase order to create an enforceable contract, and because \nUCW never signed and returned Order 13502--or any other order-there is no \ncontract. D.I. 8 at 6-7. \nParagraph 2.1 of the Licensing Agreement sets out the ordinary licensing \nscheme between the two entities: \nCUSTOMER may purchase (a) a license to the \nPlatform and Products, (b) Technical Support Services \nand/or ( c) the SaaS Service, in each case, by submitting \na written and signed purchase order (which term, for \n7 purposes of this Agreement, shall be deemed to include \norder forms prescribed by CYBRAR Y, if any) ( each, an \n\"Order\") for written acceptance by CYBRARY. Each \nOrder shall specify the Platform Services ordered, the \nitems and license terms of Platform and/or the Technical \nSupport Services being ordered and, in each case, the \napplicable pricing. Upon acceptance of the Order by \nCYBRARY and the acceptance by CUSTOMER of this \nAgreement, the license of the Platform, the \naccess to the Platform Services and the provision of \nTechnical Support Services shall be governed by the \nterms of this Agreement. Fees payable for the Platform \nServices, the Technical Support Services and licenses \nshall be as set forth in accepted Order issued under this \nAgreement. Any preprinted provisions of \nCUSTOMER's purchase orders or other terms not \nexpressly included in this Agreement or an Order shall \nnot apply, and as between CYBRARY and CUSTOMER \nthe terms set forth in this Agreement shall be applicable \nand control. Each Order shall be governed by and \nincorporated into this Agreement, and any reference to \nthis Agreement shall be [sic] default include all \napplicable Orders. In the case of conflict between an \nOrder and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement \nshall govern unless the Order terms explicitly indicate an \nintent to override any conflicting provisions in this \nAgreement. CYBRARY reserves the right to change its \nprices and r~lated terms and conditions at any time \nwithout notice, provided that any such changes shall not \naffect Orders already accepted. All Platform, Open \nSource Platform and Documentation shall be delivered \nvia electronic download. No hard copies shall be \nprovided. All Products and the Platform Services shall \nbe deemed accepted by CUSTOMER upon the earlier of \ndelivery or when made available. \nD.I. 8-1 at 21 ( emphasis added).1 \n1 In this Licensing Agreement, \"CUSTOMER\" refers to UCW. See D.I. 8-1 at 19. \n8 Read in isolation, Paragraph 2.1 suggests that a condition precedent to any \nenforceable contract is the submission and acceptance of a written and signed \npurchase order. And Order 13502, while written, was never signed by either party. \nA reasonable interpretation of Paragraph 2.1 thus suggests that Order 13502 is not \nyet enforceable because it was not signed and submitted. \nBut when interpreting a contract, I must \"read [the] contract as a whole and \n... give each provision and term effect .... \" Osborn, 991 A.2d at 1159 (citation \nomitted). Also, \"a contract should be interpreted in such a way as to not render \nany of its provisions illusory or meaningless.\" Sonitrol Holding Co. v. Marceau \nlnvestissements, 607 A.2d 1177, 1183 (Del. 1992) (citation omitted). \nReading the Licensing Agreement as a whole suggests a second reasonable \ninterpretation: Order 13502 was incorporated into the Agreement. First, Paragraph \n2.2 of the Licensing Agreement states that \"[t]his agreement will follow the terms \nand conditions established in the Order number 13502 issued by CYBRARY.\" \nD.I. 8-1 at 21. Second, the Licensing Agreement's integration clause states that \n\"[t]his Agreement and its Exhibits, including all Orders, and any separate \nCYBRARY agreement referenced elsewhere in this Agreement constitute the \nentire understanding between the parties .... \"). D.I. 8-1 at 32 (emphasis added). \n9 Beyond express incorporation, other provisions in the Licensing Agreement \nalign with many of the terms found in Order 13502: \nProvision in Licensing Agreement Similar Provision in Order 13502 \nParagraph 1.8 states that \"'Subscription Order 13502's listed service end date is \nTerm', shall have the meaning given also August 31, 2024. D.I. 8-1 at 3 \nsuch term in an Order Form, which in ( emphasis added). \nthis case, will be August 31st, 2024.\" \nD.I. 8-1 at 20 (emphasis added). \nParagraph 3 .2 outlines a payment In Order 13502, the first year \nschedule for a Cybrary for Teams investment order also lists an order for \nsubscription: for the first year of 3,000 licenses at a price of $200 per \ninvestment, the price is $200 per license. D.I. 8-1 at 2 ( emphasis added). \nlicense, with a quantity of 3,000 \nlicenses ordered. D .I. 8-1 at 22 \n( emphasis added). \nParagraph 3 .3 sets out a quarterly Order 13502's \"Additional Terms\" \npayment schedule for the first year, section states that \"[f]or the first year, \nwith payment due on October 12, payment due dates\" will be in October \n2021; January 10, 2022; April 11, 2021, January 2022, April 2022, and \n2022; and July 11, 2022. D.I. 8-1 at 22 July 2022. D.I. 8-1 at 3 (emphasis \n( emphasis added) added). \nThese references would be \"meaningless\" if Order 13 5 02 is not incorporated \ninto the Licensing Agreement. Sonitrol, 607 A.2d at 1183. There would be no \nneed to state in Paragraph 1.8 that the subscription term was August 31, 2024 \nbecause there would be no subscription. Paragraph 3 .2 similarly would not need to \noutline a price of $200 per license and a quantity of 3,000 licenses, nor would \nParagraph 3 .3 need to outline a payment schedule. \nThe amendment to the Licensing Agreement does not undermine this \ninterpretation; rather, it confirms it. The amendment makes two primary changes: \n10 First, it changes the \"Subscription Term\" definition \"in this case\" to \"January 10, \n2025.\" D.I. 8-1 at 39. Second, the payment due dates are delayed to January 17, \nApril 18, July 19, and October 17, 2022. At first glance, these new dates are now \nat odds with the original dates in Order 13502. D.I. 8-1 at 3. But the amendment \nelaborates that the subscription term was changed \"in support of the agreed-upon \n3-year partnership between the Parties.\" D.I. 8-1 at 39. This matches the three \nyears of subscriptions outlined in Order 13502. D.I. 8-1 at 2. And except for the \nenumerated changes, the Licensing \"Agreement is unaffected and shall continue in \nfull force and effect in accordance with its terms and conditions.\" D.I. 8-1 at 39. \nThus, these amendments reinforce an anticipated three years of licensing; the \npayment schedule has simply been pushed back one month. Indeed, if Order \n13502 was not incorporated into the Licensing Agreement, then there would be no \nneed to amend the payment due dates because with no placed order, no payment \nwould be due. The amendment makes sense-and is not meaningless or illusory\u00ad\nonly if Order 13502 is an enforceable contract. \nParagraph 2.1 fits within this scheme because it reasonably applies to \nsubsequent contracts. After all, UCW is a university, and its student enrollment \nnumbers may fluctuate from year-to-year. Under Paragraph 2.1, if subsequent \nlicenses are necessary, then the parties do not have to redraft the Licensing \nAgreement; they can simply sign, submit, and execute another purchase order. \n11 This interpretation need not be correct to defeat a motion to dismiss. Rather, \nit need only be reasonable , because I \"cannot choose between two differing \nreasonable interpretations of ambiguous provisions .\" VLIW, 840 A.2d at 615. \nBecause there are two reasonable interpretations of the Licensing Agreement-one \nthat incorporates Order 13502, and one that does not-I will deny Cybrary's \nmotion to dismiss. \n* * * * \nNOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington this Sixth day of February in 2023, IT \nIS HEREBY ORDERED that Learningwise Education Inc. d/b/a University \nCanada West's Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. \nC F JUDGE \n12 "}
