INTRODUCTION Civil Action No. 19-870-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nPresently pending before the Court is Petitioner Joseph Wallace's Petition for a \nWrit of Habeas Corpus (\"Petition\"). (D.I. 3) For the reasons set forth below, the Court \nwill summarily dismiss the Petition for failure to prosecute. \nII. BACKGROUND \nOn January 30, 2015, a Delaware Superior Court jury found Petitioner guilty of \nfour counts of theft of a firearm, three counts of criminal mischief less than $1,000, two \ncounts of third degree criminal trespass, and one count each of theft from a senior, theft \ngreater than $1,500, and selling stolen property less than $1,500. See Wallace v. State, \nNo. 385, 2015, Order (Del. Dec. 22, 2015). The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to \na total of seventeen years at Level V, with credit for eighty days previously served, \nsuspended after successful completion of the Level V Key Program for decreasing levels of supervision. See id. at 1. After filing a direct appeal on Petitioner's behalf, \ndefense counsel filed a no-merits brief and motion to withdraw under Delaware \nSupreme Court Rule 26(c). See id. at 2. The Delaware Supreme Court reviewed the \nrecord and the State's motion to affirm, and concluded that Petitioner's direct appeal \nwas \"wholly without merit and devoid of any arguably appealable issue.\" Id. at 3. \nTherefore, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's judgment and \ndenied defense counsel's motion to withdraw as moot. Id. \nIt appears that Petitioner filed a motion for review of sentence with the Delaware \nSuperior Court on April 1, 2019, which the Superior Court denied on April 15, 2019. \n(D.I. 3 at 3 ,r 11) Petitioner did not appeal that decision. (D. I. 3 at 5 ,r 11 (d)) \nPetitioner filed the instant Petition on May 9, 2019 while he was incarcerated at \nthe Howard Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington, Delaware. (D.I. 3) The sole \nclaim in the Petition alleges that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance during \nPetitioner's trial and by failing to pursue valid claims on direct appeal. (D.I. 3 at 5-6) On \nOctober 30, 2019, the Court issued an Order informing Petitioner that the Antiterrorism \nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, applies to his \nform habeas Petition (\"initial AEDPA Order\"). (D.1. 5) The initial AEDPA Order directed \nPetitioner to complete an AEDPA Election Form indicating how he wished to proceed, \nand also informed Petitioner that the Court would proceed to rule on the pending \nPetition as filed if Petitioner did not file the AEDPA Election Form by November 29, \n2019. (/d.) \nPetitioner never filed a completed AEDPA Election Form indicating how he \nwished to proceed; in fact, he has not filed anything with the Court since his original \n2 filing in May 2019. Utilizing Vinelink (Delaware's inmate locator), the Court determined \nthat Petitioner was released during the pendency of the instant proceeding and is \ncurrently living in the community on supervised release. Consequently, on November 2, \n2021, given Petitioner's failure to file an AEDPA Election Form and/or inquire about the \nstatus of his habeas Petition, the Court issued an order directing Petitioner to inform the \nCourt by December 4, 2021 if he still wishes to proceed with the instant habeas \nproceeding (\"show cause order\") and that his \"failure to timely return a written document \nindicating his intent shall result in the Court summarily dismissing the case for failure to \nprosecute.\" (D.I. 6) The show cause order also directed the Clerk of the Court to obtain \nPetitioner's current address from the Delaware Department of Correction and send the \norder to Petitioner at that address. (/d.) Petitioner did not file a response by the \nDecember 4, 2021 deadline. \nIll. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n\"The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that they are not \ninconsistent with any statutory provision or [the habeas corpus) rules, may be applied to \na [habeas) proceeding.\" Rule 12, Rules Governing Section 2254 Proceedings for the \nUnited States District Courts, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n41 (b) authorizes a district court to sua sponte dismiss an action if a party fails to \nprosecute the action or comply with the court's order or rules. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n41 (b ). Similarly, Local Rule 41.1 provides that, \"in each case pending wherein no \naction has been taken for a period of 3 months, the Court may, on its motion or upon \napplication of any party, and after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard, \n3 enter an order dismissing such case unless good reason for the inaction is given.\" \nD. Del. LR41.1. \nWhen determining whether to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute under \nRule 41 (b ), district courts in the Third Circuit must balance the following six factors \nset forth in Pou/is v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., 7 4 7 F .2d 863 (3d Cir. 1984 ): \n(1) the extent of the party's personal responsibility; (2) the \nprejudice to the adversary caused by the failure to meet \nscheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a history of \ndilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party or the \nattorney was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of \nsanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of \nalternative sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim \nor defense. \nId. at 868; see Parks v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 380 F. App'x 190, 194 (3d Cir. 2010). \nImportantly, \"[n]o single Pou/is factor is dispositive [ ... and] not all of the Pou/is factors \nneed to be satisfied in order to dismiss a complaint.\" Briscoe v. Klaus, 538 F.3d 252, \n262 (3d Cir. 2008). \nIV. DISCUSSION \nAn assessment of the Pou/is factors weighs heavily in favor of dismissing the \ninstant Petition. The first factor weighs against Petitioner because, as a pro se litigant, \nhe is personally responsible for prosecuting his case. See, e.g., Lopez v. Cousins, 435 \nF. App'x 113, 116 (3d Cir. 2011) (\"As a general rule, a prose litigant is responsible for \nhis failure to comply with court orders.\") The second factor -prejudice to the adversary \n-is neutral, because there is no indication that Petitioner's failure to respond to the \nCourt's show cause order prejudices the State. The third, fourth, and fifth factors weigh \nin favor of dismissal, because: (1) Petitioner's failure to file a completed AEDPA election \nform, his failure to update the Court with a new address after being released from \n4 prison, and his failure to respond the Court's November 2021 show cause order support \na conclusion that he has a history of dilatoriness; (2) Petitioner's failure to reply to the \nCourt's show cause order appears to be willful since the order was sent to his current \naddress and he was warned that such a failure would result in summary dismissal ; and \n(3) given Petitioner 's in forma pauperis status, an alternate monetary sanction would not \nbe more effective. Finally, the sixth Pou/is factor is neutral, because the Petition lacks \nsufficient information to allow the Court to effectively determine the meritoriousness of \nPetitioner 's sole claim for relief. \nIn summary , at least four of the six Pou/is factors weigh in favor of dismissal. \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that dismissal for failure to prosecute is appropriate \nunder Rule 41(b). \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant \nPetition under Rule 41 (b) for failure to prosecute. The Court will also decline to issue a \ncertificate of appealability because Petitioner has failed to make a \"substantial \nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right.'' as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \nSee United States v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470, 474 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order follows. \nDated: January/ f, 2022 \nCalm F.
