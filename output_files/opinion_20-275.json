Hall", "date": "01-27-2022", "ocr_text": "   \n \n   \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nIN RE  PATTERN ENERGY GROUP  \nINC. SECURITIES LITIGATION   \n \n \nC.A. No. 20- 275-MN-JLH \n \n \n \n \nREPORT & RECOMMENDATION \nIn this action challenging the purchase of Pattern Energy Group Inc. by the Canad a Pension \nPlan Investment Board, Defendants move to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Class \nAction Complaint  (\u201cSAC\u201d) .  (D.I. 76; D.I. 78; D.I.  79.)  As discussed below , I conclude that  the \nSAC plausibly alleges  claims under Section s 14(a)  and 20(a)  of the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934.  However, Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims should be dismissed.   \nI. BACKGROUND1 \nA. The Parties  \nThis dispute arises from an agreement between Defendant Pattern Energy Group Inc. \n(\u201cPattern Energy\u201d) and the Canada Pe nsion Plan Investment Board (\u201cCPPIB\u201d) to merge Pattern \nEnergy with a subsidiary of CPPIB.  That agreement was announced on November 4, 2019.  Plaintiffs are investment funds that owned Pattern Energy stock at the time of the merger.  ( SAC \n \n1 My prior Report and Recommendation summarized the allegations in Plaintiffs\u2019 previous \npleading (the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint  (D.I. 26)).  See In re Pattern Energy \nGrp. Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 20- 275-MN-JLH, 2021 WL 311257 (D. Del. Jan. 28, 2021) \n(recommending dismissal of complaint with leave to amend), report and recommendation \nadopted, 2021 WL 765760 (D. Del. Feb. 26, 2021).  The facts recited  in this section are taken from \nthe allegations in the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Com plaint  (D.I. 76 (\u201cSAC\u201d) ), \ndocuments  it references or relies on, and matters of which the Court may take judicial notice.  \nTellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).   \n    \n \n2 \n \u00b6 40.)  Plaintiff s were all advised by their investment advisor, Water Island Capital, LLC (\u201cWater \nIsland Capital\u201d).  ( Id.) \nAt all times relevant here, Defendant Pattern Energy was a Delaware Corporation with \n\u201cprincipal executive offices\u201d in San Francisco, California.  ( Id. \u00b6 41, App\u2019x A .)  Its business was \noperating wind and solar power facilities in the United States, Canada, and Japan.  ( Id.)  Pattern \nEnergy acquired the facilities that it operated primarily by purchasing them from nonparty Pattern \nEnergy Group 2 LP (\u201cPattern Development\u201d) and its predecessor company .  (Id. \u00b6 41.)  Pattern \nDevelopment was a Delaware limited partnership with \u201cprincipal executive offices\u201d in San \nFrancisco.  ( Id. \u00b6 74, App\u2019x A .)  Its business was developing renewable energy and transmission \nassets.  ( Id.)   \nDefendant Riverstone Holdings LLC (\u201cRiverstone  Holdings \u201d) is a Delaware limited \nliability company and is an energy-  and power -focused private investment firm.  ( Id. \u00b6 45, App\u2019x \nA.)  Defendant Riverstone Pattern Ener gy II Holdings, LP (\u201cRiverstone PE\u201d) is a Delaware limited \npartnership that owned an equity stake in Pattern Development  until  the merger .  (Id. \u00b6 46, App\u2019x \nA.)   \nAccording to the SAC, Riverstone Holdings and its affiliates (collectively, \u201cRiverstone\u201d)  \nheld a controlling 70% equity interest in Pattern Development before the merger.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 46, 51, \nApp\u2019x A .)  The remaining equity interest of Pattern Development was owned as follows: Pattern \nEnergy held a 29% equity stake, and most of the remaining 1% was he ld by Pattern Development\u2019s \nmanagement, many of whom also had high- level management roles at Pattern Energy.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 24, \n43, 52, App\u2019x A .)  At the time of the merger, Pattern Development had a consent right that limited \nPattern Energy\u2019s ability to transfer its interest in Pattern Development to any third party without \nthe consent of Pattern Development.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 51, 52, App\u2019x A ; D.I. 82, Ex. B ( \u201cProxy Stmt.\u201d )    \n \n3 \n at 36.)   Because Riverstone held a controlling equity stake  in Pattern Development , Riverstone \ncontrolled the consent right.  ( SAC \u00b6 47, App\u2019x A .) \nThe individuals named as defendants in the SAC include the members of Pattern Energy\u2019s \nBoard at the time of the merger (\u201cBoard Defendants\u201d) and six members of Pattern Energy\u2019s \nmanagement team (\u201c Officer Defendants\u201d).  The Board Defendants are Alan R. Batkin, Edmund \nJohn Philip Browne, Richard A. Goodman, Douglas G. Hall, Patricia M. Newson, Mona K. \nSutphen, and Michael Garland.  ( SAC  \u00b6\u00b6 64\u201370.) The Officer  Defendants are Michael Garland, \nHunter Armi stead, Daniel Elkort, Michael Lyon, Esben Pedersen, and Christopher Shugart.  ( Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 53\u201359.)  Defendant Garland was the CEO of both Pattern Energy and Pattern Development as \nwell as a member of the boards of directors at both companies.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 60.)   \nB. The Proxy Statement  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 federal claims are all based on their contention that the proxy materials sent to \nPattern Energy shareholders in connection with its  merger  with CPPIB  contained material \nmisrepresentations and omissions.  The February 4, 2020 proxy statement  (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d)  \nis 138 pages, single -spaced, plus attachments.2  It contains an 18- page summary of the merger \nnegotiations.  ( Proxy Stmt. at 36 \u201354.)  Below I summarize th e portions of the Proxy Statement  and \nthe corresponding allegations  in the SAC that are  most  relevant to the Court\u2019s  resolution of the \npending motions . \nOn June 5, 2018, Pattern Energy\u2019s Board decided to begin exploring \u201cstrategic \nopportunities,\u201d including opportunities to merge.  ( Id. at 36 \u201337.)  The Board ap pointed a Special \nCommittee composed of independent directors to conduct its strategic review , and Defendant \n \n2 While Plaintiffs did not attach to their pleading copies of the SEC filings on which their \nExchange Act claims are based, no one disputes that the Court may properly consider those filings \nwhen ruling on the pending motions.       \n \n4 \n Batkin was appointed as Chairperson.  ( Id.)  The Special Committee retained outside legal counsel, \nand it retained Evercore Group LLC (\u201cEvercore\u201d) and Goldman Sachs & Co. as its financial  \nadvisors .  (Id. at 37, 40.)   \nOver the next year, the Special Committee engaged with several bidders.  At an  October \n29, 2018 meeting of the Special Committee, Defendant  Garland \u2014who was not a member of the \nSpecial C ommittee \u2014summarized an approach \u201c he had received from representatives of a large \nalternative asset manager (referred to [in the Proxy Statement] as \u2018Party A\u2019) which owns a \nsubstantial interest in a company in the alternative energy industry (referred to [i n the Proxy \nStatement] as \u2018Company A\u2019) .\u201d  (Proxy Stmt. at 37; SAC \u00b6 82.)  According to the SAC, Party A  \nwas Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (\u201cBrookfield\u201d)  and Company A was TerraForm Power, \nInc. (\u201cTerraForm\u201d), in which Brookfield owned an equity stake.  (SAC  \u00b6 82.)  The Special \nCommittee asked  Garland to reach out to representatives of Brookfield to see if they would provide \na preliminary written proposal for a strategic transaction.  (Proxy Stmt. at 37\u201338.)    \nPattern Energy\u2019s discussions with Brookfield continued for the better part of a year.  ( Id. \nat 38\u201353; SAC \u00b6\u00b6  82\u2013107.)  On February 21, 2019, Brookfield  sent \u201ca preliminary non- binding \nterm sheet outlining high- level proposed terms for a potential transaction\u201d involving the \nacquisition of Pattern Energy by TerraForm in exchange for TerraForm stock at an at-market \nexchange ratio .  (Proxy Stmt. at 39;  SAC  \u00b6 83.)  According to the SAC, Brookfield\u2019s proposal was \nnot conditioned on an acquisition of Pattern Development.  (SAC \u00b6 83.)  T he Special Committee \ndiscussed th e proposal at meetings in February and Ma rch 2019.  ( Proxy Stmt. at 39; SAC \u00b6\u00b6  84\u2013\n85.)  The SAC alleges that, a t those meetings, the Special Committee noted the potential benefits \nof a transaction with Brookfield, including increased access to capital.  ( SAC \u00b6\u00b6 84\u201385.)  However, \nDefendants Garlan d and Elkort warned the Special Committee that despite the potential for    \n \n5 \n \u201csignificant synergies\u201d in a Brookfield transaction, the need for Riverstone\u2019s support was \nimportant because  Patte rn Development\u2019s consent r ight would \u201clikely be implicated .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 85.) \nAccording to the SAC, \u201cPattern Energy re sponded to the Brookfield bid with a  [March 11 , \n2019]  term sheet restructured by Special Committee advisors Paul Weiss [, Rifkind, Wharton & \nGarrison LLP ] and Evercore .\u201d (SAC \u00b6 86.)  The \u201cnew term sheet was structured as a  merger of \nTerraForm into a subsidiary of Pattern Energy.\u201d   (Id.)  That structure would have allegedly left \nPattern Energy as the surviving entity, thereby eliminating the need for Pattern Development\u2019s \nconsent to the transaction .  (Id.) \nBeginning in April 2019, some of the discussions between Pattern Energy and Brookfield  \nincluded Riverstone.  (Proxy Stmt. at 40.)  At a meeting between Defendant Batkin, Pattern Energy \nmanagement, Brookfield  representatives, and Riverstone representatives on April 16, 2019, \nRiverstone indicated that it would be open to considering proposals from Brookfield  that included \nthe acquisition of Pattern Development  as well as Pattern Energy .  (Id.)  On May 31, 2019, Pattern \nEnergy received a revised term sheet from Brookfield for an all -stock acquisition of Pattern Energy \nby TerraForm that reflected a 15% merger premium .  (Proxy Stmt. at 41; SAC \u00b6  87.)  The term \nsheet proposed that the combined company would concurre ntly purchase Pattern Development at \na price to be negotiated by Pattern Energy and Riverstone , such that Riverstone would be cashed \nout and no longer have any ownership.  (Proxy Stmt. at 41; SAC \u00b6 87.)  \nWhile the discussions with Brookfield (and others) continued, Pattern Energy was also in \ntalks with CPPIB.  On June 28, 2019, CPPIB sent the Special Committee a non- binding proposal \nto purchase the outstanding shares of Pattern Energy common stock for $25.50 per share in cas h, \n\u201cconditioned on an agreement be ing reached between CPPIB and Riverstone for the acquisition of    \n \n6 \n Pattern Development .\u201d  (SAC \u00b6 88; Proxy Stmt. at 42.)  According to the SAC, the offer \u201c reflected \na 11% merger premium  based on Pattern Energy\u2019s stock price on that date.\u201d  (SAC \u00b6 88.)   \nOn Ju ly 23, 2019, Brookfield submitted a revised  proposal  for an all -stock merger between \nTerraForm and Pattern Energy.  (Proxy Stmt. 43\u201344; SAC \u00b6 90.)  Brookfield again proposed to \nacquire Pattern Energy in an all -stock transaction at an exchange ratio to reflect an implied 15% \npremium to the price of Pattern Energy stock, with the combined entity purchasing Pattern \nDevelopment .  Brookfield also indicated that it would be willing to acquire Pattern Energy at a \n20% premium without also acquiring Pattern Deve lopment .  (Proxy Stmt. 43\u201344; SAC \u00b6 90.)  \nAccording to the SAC, both of those bids \u201cwere superior to CPPIB\u2019s $25.50 bid .\u201d  (SAC  \u00b6 90.)   At \na meeting on July 31, 2019, the Special Committee recognized that Brookfield\u2019s offers exceeded \nCPPIB\u2019s current offer.   (SAC \u00b6 92.)   \nOn August 16, 2019, CPPIB provided the Special Committee with a revised proposal to \nacquire Pattern Energy common stock for between $26.25 and $26.50 in cash per share and to \npurchase the equity interests in Pattern Development not owned by Pattern Energy from \nRiverstone.  (Proxy Stmt. at 45; SAC \u00b6 94.)   The SAC alleges that  CPPIB\u2019s August 16 offer  was \n\u201cstill well below Brookfield\u2019s then current bid.\u201d  (SAC \u00b6 94.)   \nOn August 26, 2019, Brookfield made a revised proposal .  (Proxy Stmt. at 46.)  The SAC \nalleges that Brookfield\u2019s proposal letter revealed  information not disclosed in the Proxy Statement , \nincluding  that the Special Committee\u2019s advisors had told Brookfield (1) that the Board no longer \nsupported a transaction that  internalized Pattern Development and (2)  that Riverstone would use \nits consent right to block any deal in which Terra Form became the parent company of Pattern \nEnergy.   (SAC \u00b6 99.)  Accordingly, Brookfield proposed  to acquire Pattern Energy through an all -\nstock merger between Pattern Energy and Terra Form, with Pattern Development remaining a    \n \n7 \n separate entity.  (Proxy Stmt. at 46; SAC \u00b6 99.)   Brookfield\u2019s proposal contemplated that Pattern \nEnergy would acquire TerraForm, leaving Pattern Energy as the survivi ng entity.  That deal \nstructure , according to the SAC , would have eliminated the need for  Riverstone\u2019s consent  to the \ntransaction .  (SAC \u00b6  99.)   \nThe SAC alleges that , on August 28, 2019, \u201cEvercore informed the Special Committee that \nBrookfield\u2019s proposal implied a merg er price of $34 per share of Pattern Energy common stock as \nof that date, and represented a 45% merger premium for Pattern Energy Shareholders,\u201d making it \n\u201csuperior[]\u201d to CPPIB\u2019s then -current bid.  (S AC \u00b6\u00b6 100, 113, 128.)   The Proxy Statement  reported \nof the same meeting that Evercore had presented an analysis of the August 26 Brookfield offer \nyielding premium ranges of \u201cbetween 1.4% and 28.8%  . . . based on an expected range of trading \nprices for shares of the combined c ompany\u2019s common stock post -transaction and on certain other \nassumptions.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 111, 113; Proxy Stmt. at 46.)   \nDefendant Garland, Brookfield  representatives, and Riverstone representatives  met on \nSeptember 4, 2019 to discuss Brookfield\u2019s August 26 proposal.  (Proxy Stmt. at 48.)  At the \nmeeting , Brookfield  and Riverstone \u201cindicated that they would not be supportive of a combination \nof Pattern [Energy] and [TerraForm ] absent certain changes to the agreements governing the \ncommercial relationship between Pattern [Energy] and Pattern Development.\u201d  ( Id.)  The SAC \nalleges that, a fter the meeting, Defendant Batkin asked Riverstone \u201cto provide Brookfield with a \nlist of proposed new governance terms between Pattern Energy and Pattern Development.\u201d  (SAC \u00b6 146.)   \nThe SAC alleges that, a t a Special Committee meeting on September 29, 2019, Defendant \nBatkin reported that  Riverstone had provided Brookfield with a \u201cfairly expansive\u201d list of terms, \nand that Brookfield had indicated that it would be \u201cwilling and able to sign onto the terms of    \n \n8 \n [Brookfield\u2019s] letter as -is.\u201d  ( Id.)  The Proxy Statement  did not disclose that deve lopment.  (Proxy \nStmt. at 50.)  The Proxy Statement did disclose that  Batkin thereafter informed Brookfie ld that, \nalthough it  had proposed a competitive offer to acquire Pattern Energy, Brookfield  would need to \n\u201cconfirm, either that (1) [Brookfield\u2019s ] proposal was not conditioned on [it] entering into \nagreements with Pattern Development and Riverstone or (2) [Brookfield] had negotiated definitive \ndrafts of such agreements with Pattern Development  and Riverstone .\u201d  (Proxy Stmt. at 51.)  \nOn October 17, 2019, Evercore, at the request of the Special Committee, asked Brookfield \nand CPPIB to submit proposed definitive documentation by October 23, 2019 and \u201cbest and final\u201d \noffers by October 28, 2019.  ( Id. at 51; SAC  \u00b6\u00b6 105.)  On October 28, 2019, CPPIB submitted a \nfinal all- cash offer of $26.75 per share for the outstanding shares of Pattern Energy.  (Proxy Stmt. \nat 52; SAC  \u00b6 105.)  CPPIB\u2019s offe r\u2014which was ultimately accepted \u2014contemplated a concurrent \nacquisition of Pattern Development.  (Proxy Stmt. at 53\u201354.)   \nAlso on October 28, 2019, Brookfield  reaffirmed its  offer to acquire Pattern Energy in an \nall-stock transaction involving the combination of Pattern Energy and TerraForm , with Pattern \nDevelopment remaining a separate entity.  (Proxy Stmt. at 52; SAC  \u00b6 105.)  Brookfield  did no t \nsubmit transaction documentation, and the Special Committee agreed to extend the deadline to \nOctober 30, 2019.  (Proxy Stmt. at 52.)   The Special Committee also a sked Brookfield to confirm \nthat i t would be willing to proceed with a merger regardless of any agreement (or the lack thereof ) \nbetween Brookfield and Riverstone.  (Id.)  The Proxy Statement  did not report, however, that \nBrookfield  told Pattern Energy on October 28, 2019 that it \u201ccould agree\u201d to all of Riverstone\u2019s \nproposed terms  for the agreements .  (SAC \u00b6 \u00b6 148\u2013149.)  \nOn October 30, 2019, Brookfield  submitted a draft merger agreement that conditioned \nclosing on it entering into agreements with Riverstone.  ( Proxy Stmt. at  52.)  Later that day, counsel    \n \n9 \n for the Special Committee communicated to Brookfield  that it would need to finalize any \narrangements with Riverstone that Brookfield  believed necessary and to submit executable \ntransaction documentation prior to close of busi ness on November 2, 2019.  ( Id.)  Brookfield  \nindicated that it believed it could negotiate such agreements  within 30 days, but the Special \nCommittee reiterated its request for executable transaction documentation by November 2.  ( Id.)  \nAccording to the SAC , the Proxy Statement\u2019s failure to report Brookfield\u2019s willingness to agree to \nRiverstone\u2019s proposed terms \u201cleft shareholders with the misleading impression that the failures [to \nfinalize contractual arrangements with Riverstone] were Brookfield\u2019s . . . .\u201d   (SAC \u00b6 149.)   \nThe Special Committee met on October 31, 2019 to discuss the bids from CPPIB and \nBrookfield .  (Prox y Stmt. at 52; SAC \u00b6 106.)  The SAC alleges that, a t the meeting, Evercore told \nthe Special Committee that \u201c Brookfield\u2019s offer provided Pattern Energy shareholders far greater \nper share consideration than CPPIB.  Specifically, Evercore concluded that Brookfield\u2019s offer had \nan implied value of up to $32.94 per share of Pattern Energy common stock (compared to CPPIB\u2019s \noffer of $26.75 per share) if the combined company maintained TerraForm\u2019s dividend policy and \ntraded at TerraForm\u2019s 5.72% dividend yield in 2020.\u201d  (SAC \u00b6 106.)   \nOn November 2, 2019, Brookfield  told the Special Committee that it would not be \nsubmitting a final proposal.  (Proxy Stmt. at 53; SAC \u00b6\u00b6 149 \u2013150.)   On November 3, 2019, \nEvercore opined to the Special Committee that CPPIB\u2019s offer of $26.75 per share was fair from a \nfinancial point of view.  (Proxy Stmt. at 53.)  The Special Committee recommended that the Board \napprove the merger, which it did.  (Proxy Stmt. at 53; SAC  \u00b6 107.)    \nThe Board filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a Schedule 14A \nDefinitive Proxy Statement on February 4, 2020, recommending that the shareholders vote in favor of the proposed merger with CPPIB .  It explained that, pursuant to the merger transaction, Pattern    \n \n10 \n Energy would be merged with a newly formed affiliate of CPPIB.  (Proxy Stmt. at 53\u201354, 74.)  In \nexchange, shares of Pattern Energy Company Common Stock would be convert ed to the right to \nreceive $26.75 in cash.  (Proxy Stmt. at 53.)  The Proxy Statement further disclosed that, pursuant \nto a concurrent transaction \u2014dubbed the \u201cContribution Agreement\u201d \u2014the Management Defendants \nand Riverstone would be contributing their respective stakes in Pattern Development to an affiliate \nof CPPIB in exchange for equity interests in the affiliate.  (Proxy Stmt. at 74.)  The combined result of the Pattern Energy merger and the acquisition of Pattern Development pursuant to the Contribution Agreement was that Pattern Energy and Pattern Development would be under the \ncommon ownership of CPPIB.  (Proxy Stmt. at 74; SAC  App\u2019x A .) \nThe Proxy Statement represented  that \u201cafter consultation with its financial advisors, the \nSpecial Committee believed \u201d that the proposed merger consideration  \u201crepresented the best value \nreasonably available  to [the] s tockholders .\u201d  (Proxy Stmt. at 55; SAC \u00b6 81.)  Similarly , in a \nFebruary 26, 2020 Form 8- K, Pattern Energy stated that [t]he Special Committee sought and \nbelieves it obtained the highest price reasonably available for Pattern Energy.\u201d  (See Pattern Energy \nGrp., Inc ., Current Report, Ex. 99.1 (Form 8- K) (Feb. 26, 2020)\n3; SAC \u00b6 81.)   \nThe Proxy Statement garnered negative attention, including from Plaintiffs\u2019 financial \nadvisor, Water Island Capital .  Two proxy advisory services, Institutional Shareholder Services \nand Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC, both recommended that Pattern Energy shareholders vote against \nthe proposed merger.  (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 20, 127, 128.)   The  shareholders nevertheless voted to approve the \nmerger at a special meeting on March 10, 2020.  ( SAC  \u00b6 170.)  \n \n3 The February 26, 2020 Form 8-K is available online via the SEC\u2019s EDGAR database at \nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561660/000095014220000593/eh2000383_ex9901.ht\nm (last visited Jan. 26, 2022) .    \n \n11 \n C. Procedural History  \nPlaintiffs filed this action  on February 25, 2020, two weeks before the merger was \napproved via shareholder vote.  (D.I. 1.)   On May 22, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated \nAmended Class Action Complaint , alleging violations of federal securities law s and state law .  \n(D.I. 26.)   Defendants moved to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint .  (D.I. \n48; D.I.  50.)  I recommended that the Court grant the motions to dismiss.  See In re Pattern Energy , \n2021 WL 311257 (D.I. 68) .  On February 26, 2021, t he Court adopted my report and \nrecommendation and dismissed the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint  over \nPlaintiffs\u2019  objections .  See In re Pattern Energy , 2021 WL 765760 (D.I. 74) . \n On March 29, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action \nComplaint.   (D.I. 76.)  The SAC adds new factual allegations supporting Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.  Count \nI alleges violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) , 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a), against Pattern Energy, the Board Defendants, and the Officer Defendants.  Count \nII alleges violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), against the Board \nDefendants  and the Officer Defendants .  Count III is a state  law breach of fiduciary duty claim \nagainst the Board Defen dants and the Officer Defendants.  Count IV alleges that Riverstone  is \nliable for aiding and abetting the  breaches of fiduciary duties.   \nDefendants again filed mo tions to dismiss.  (D.I. 78 (Pattern Energy , Board Defendants, \nand Officer Defendants); D.I.  79 (Riverstone) .)  Both motions are fully briefed.  (D.I. 80; D.I. 81; \nD.I. 82; D.I. 83; D.I. 84; D.I. 86; D.I. 87.)  I heard oral argument on September 2, 2021 ( \u201cTr. __\u201d ). \n     \n \n12 \n II. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motions to Dismiss  for Failure to State a Claim  \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief tha t is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reas onable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\u201d  Id.  (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.  \u201cWhere \na complaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely consistent with\u2019 a defendant's liability, it \u2018 stops short of \nthe line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u2019\u201d  Id.  (quoting Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 557).   \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint, I must assume all \u201cwell -pleaded facts\u201d are  \ntrue but need not assume the truth of legal conclusions .  Id. at 679.  \u201c[W]hen the allegations in a \ncomplaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the \ncourt.\u201d  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (internal  quotation marks omitted).  \nB. Exchange Act Pleading Requirements  \nSection 14(a) of the Exchange  Act \u201cmakes it unlawful to solicit a proxy \u2018in contravention \nof such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public \ninterest or for the protection of investors.\u2019\u201d  Jaroslawicz v. M&T Bank Corp., 962 F.3d 701, 709 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a)(1)) (alteration in original).  SEC Rule 14a -9, in turn, \nprohibits any proxy solicitation     \n \n13 \n containing any statement which, at the time and in the light of the \ncircumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with \nrespect to any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact \nnecessary in order to make the stat ements therein not false or \nmisleading .  . . . \n17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a -9(a). \nLiability under Section 14(a) requires a showing that \u201c(1) a proxy statement contained a \nmaterial misrepresentation or omission which (2) caused the plaintiff injury and (3) that the proxy \nsolicitation itself, rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials, was an essential link \nin the accomplishment of the transaction.\u201d  Jaroslawicz , 962 F.3d at 710 (quoting Tracinda Corp. \nv. DaimlerChrysler AG , 502 F.3d 212, 228 (3d Cir. 2007)).  However, an omission in a proxy \nstatement can violate Section 14(a) only \u201cwhere \u2018[(a)] the SEC regulations specifically require disclosure of the omitted information in a proxy statement, or [(b)] the omission makes ot her \nstatements in the proxy statement materially false or misleading.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Seinfeld  v. \nBecherer , 461 F.3d 365, 369 (3d Cir. 2006) ) (alterations in original).  In other words, absent an \nallegation that a defendant failed to make a disclosure spec ifically required by SEC regulations, a \nSection 14(a) plaintiff must demonstrate that a proxy statement is either materially false or \nmisleading standing alone or is materially misleading in light of other facts that were not disclosed \n(i.e., omitted).  Hy song v. Encore Energy Partners LP , No. 11- 781, 2011 WL 5509100, at *6 (D. \nDel.

The PSLRA requires that a Section 14(a) claim premised \non an alleged false or misleading proxy statement must \u201c specify each statement alleged to have \nbeen misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation    \n \n14 \n regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall  state \nwith particularity all facts on which that belief is formed. \u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u- 4(b)(1); see also  \nHysong, 2011 WL 5509100, at *6 (\u201c[I]n order to plead facts to sufficiently allege . . . a section \n14(a) claim, a plaintiff must identify a precise state ment in the proxy that is either affirmatively \nmisleading in and of itself, or is rendered misleading by operation of a materially omitted fact.\u201d); \nsee also Heinze v. Tesco Corp. , 971 F.3d 475, 480 (5th Cir. 2020) (\u201cEven for omission- based  \nclaims, the plaintiff must identify specific \u2018statements [in the proxy statement]\u2019 that are rendered \u2018false or misleading\u2019 by the alleged omissions.\u201d).  The court must dismiss a complaint that fails to \nsatisfy those requirements.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u- 4(b)(3)(A).   \nUnder Secti on 20(a) of the  Exchange  Act, \u201c[e]very person who, directly or indirectly, \ncontrols any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation \nthereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such  controlled \nperson to any person to whom such controlled person is liable  . . . .\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a).

III. DISCUSSION  \nDefendants argue that (1) the SAC fails to plausibly allege a Section 14(a) claim  (Count I) , \n(2) the Section 20(a) claim (Count II) fails for lack of a predicate violation  of Section 14(a) , (3) \nthe state law claims (Counts III and IV) must be litigated in the Delaware Court of Chancery, \npursuant to a forum selection clause in Pattern Energy\u2019s corporate charter, and (4) the SAC  \nnevertheless  fails to state claims under state law.      \n \n15 \n I recommend that the Court deny the request s to dismiss t he Section 14(a) and Section \n20(a) claims.  I recommend that the Court dismiss the state law claims because those claims must \nbe litigated in state court, in accordance with the forum selection clause .   \nA. The Court should deny the Pattern Energy Defendants\u2019  request to dismiss the \nSection 14(a) claim. \nCount I of the SAC alleges that Pattern Energy, the Board Defendants, and the Officer \nDefendants  (collectively, the \u201cPattern Energy Defendants\u201d)  violat ed Section 14(a)  of the Exchange \nAct.  The Pattern Energy De fendants argue that Count I should be dismissed because Plaintiffs \nfailed to plausibly allege that the proxy materials contained any false or misleading statements .  \n(D.I. 81 at 13\u201322; D.I. 87 at 2\u201310.)   In response, Plaintiffs point to numerous  statements  alleged \nto be false or misleading.  (D.I. 83 at 12\u201334.)   I conclude that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that \nthe proxy materials contained at least two false statements .  Accordingly, I recommend that the \nCourt deny the motion to dismiss Pla intiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claim . \n Two of the  alleged false statements  are statements  of opinion.  The first is in the Proxy \nStatemen t, which provide d: \n[F]ollowing extensive negotiations, the Special Committee was able \nto increase the per share Merger Consider ation offered by CPPIB to \n$26.75 in cash, which, after consultation with its financial advisors, \nthe Special Committee believed was the highest that CPPIB would \nbe willing to pay and  represented the best value reasonably \navailable to our stockholders [.] \n \n(Proxy Stmt. at 55 (emphasis added).)   The second is in the February 26, 2020 Form 8 -K, which \nsimilarly represented  that \u201c [t]he Special Committee sought and believes it obtained the highest \nprice reasonably available for Pattern Energy .\u201d  (February 26, 2020 Form 8 -K, Ex. 99.1.)   The \nSAC alleges  that th ose statements were false because the Special Committee did not actually hold    \n \n16 \n a sincere belief that CPPIB\u2019s offer represented  the best reasonably available price for Pattern \nEnergy.4  (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5, 81, 120; D.I. 83 at 12\u201316.)   \n The SAC plausibly alleges that those  two statements of opinion were false : it contains  \nfactual content that gives rise to a reasonable inference that the Special Committee did not \nsincerely  believe that CPPIB\u2019s offer represented the \u201cbest value \u201d and \u201chighest price \u201d reasonably \navailable to shareholders.5  Among other things, t he SAC allege s facts  that suggest that  the Special \nCommittee  and its advisors  acknowledged that Brookfield\u2019s bid offer ed a better value  and a  higher \nprice compared to the CPPIB deal .  The SAC also alleges facts \u2014not disclosed in the proxy \nmaterials \u2014permitting a reasonable inference  that, at the time the Board voted to approve the deal \nwith CPPIB, Brookfie ld remained willing to engage on more favorable terms .   \nDefendants point out that \u201ca reasonable investor understand[s] that opinions sometimes \nrest on a weighing of competing facts.\u201d   (D.I. 81 at 15 ( quoting Jaroslawicz , 962 F.3d at 717).)   \nThat is , of cours e, correct .  The Special Committee  was entitled to weigh facts and conclude that \nthe CPPIB offer  represented the best value and the highest price that was reasonably available to \nshareholders, especially since Brookfield failed to submit a n actionable offe r before the Special \nCommittee\u2019s deadline.  T he Special Committee  might also have reasonably concluded (as \n \n4 Defendants contend that each of those alleged misstatements \u201chas already been rejected \nby the Court.\u201d  D.I. 81 at 14.  They have not.  My previous Report and Recommendation observed \nthat Plaintiffs\u2019 prior pleading  \u201cd[id] not allege that [the Board\u2019s] opinion statements were literally \nfalse, that is, that the Board .  . . had a contra ry subjective belief .\u201d  In re Pattern Energy , 2021 WL \n311257, at *11.   \n \n5 A statement of opinion can give rise to liability under Section 14(a) if the speaker did not  \nactually hold the belief professed .  Kaufman v. Trump\u2019s Castle Funding, 7 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. \n1993)  (\u201c[O] pinions  . . . are not per se inactionable under the se curities laws.  Rather, such \nstatements of \u2018 soft information\u2019  may be actionable misrepresentations if the speaker does not \ngenuinely and reasonably believe them.\u201d); see also V a. Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. \n1083, 1092 \u201396 (1991) ( conclusory opinions can violate  Section 14(a)  when eviden ce demonstrates  \nthey are false) .      \n \n17 \n Defendants suggest) that Pattern Energy\u2019s  shareholders would ultimately be better off with \nCBBIP\u2019s  all-cash proposal  with its shorter time to closing and no risk of litigation over \nRiverstone\u2019s consent right .  (See D.I. 87 at 3; Tr. 12\u201313.)  And Pattern Energy was entitled to  \npublish in the proxy materials  the Special Committee\u2019s  opinions  that CPPIB \u2019s offer represented \nthe best value and the highest price  without disclosing all the competing facts underlying those \nopinions .  But the Special Committee  was not free to say that it believed the CPPIB offer  to be the  \nbest deal reasonably available to shareholders if the Special Commit tee did not sincerely believe \nthat to be the case.  The SAC plausibly alleges that is what happened here. \nTo be clear, one  inference that might be  drawn from the facts alleged  is that  the Special \nCommittee  did not think that Brookfield\u2019s bid was \u201creasonably available \u201d because Brookfiel d \nfailed to submit a n act ionable  offer before  the Special Committee\u2019s deadline .  But an alternative  \nplausible  inference is that  Brookfield did not submit a n offer  because the Special Committee \nimposed  an unreasonably short deadline  to finalize the necessary  agreements with Riverstone \u2014\neven though the Special Committee knew that Brookfield was willing to accede  to all of \nRiverstone\u2019s demands  and Brookfield told the Special Commit tee that it could finalize the \nagreements in 30 days .  At this stage , I must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-\nmoving party.  Here, that is Plaintiffs.    \nAs required by the PSLRA, t he SAC identifies statements alleged to be false, it explains  \nwhy those statements are believed to be  false, and it alleges facts on which that belief is formed.  \nThe alleged  facts state a  plausible  Section 14(a) claim.  Accordingly, I  recommend that the Court \ndeny the Pattern Energy Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count I .6 \n \n6 Counsel for the Pattern Energy Defendants  agreed at the hearing that, if the Court \nconcluded that Plaintiffs had identified at least one actionable misstatement, the Section 14(a) \n    \n \n18 \n B. The Court should deny the Individual Defendants\u2019 request to dismiss the \nSection 20(a) claim. \nCount II of the SAC alleges that the Board Defendants and the Officer Defendants  \n(collectively, the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d)  violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act .  The \nIndividual Defendants argue that the Section 20(a) claim should be dismissed because the SAC \nfails to allege a predicate  Exchange Act violation .     \nI conclude that the SAC does allege a Section 14(a) claim.  Accordingly, I recommend \ndenying the Individual Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Section 20(a) claim.7  \n \nclaim could move forward .  (Tr. at 33\u201334 (counsel acknowledging that, given the factual overlap \nwith the Court of Chancery case , additional guidance from the Court would likely not  impact the \nscope of discovery).)   \n \n7 At the hearing , counsel for the Pattern Energy Defendants suggested  (in response to a \nquestion from the Court)  that the Section 20(a) claims should  also be dismissed as to each \nIndividual Defendant because the SAC fails to plead  each Individual Defendant \u2019s culpab ility as a \ncontrolling person.  (Tr. 34\u201336.)  I agree with Plaintiffs that the argument was not fairly raised in \nthe briefing .  (Tr. 88 \u201389.)   This  is the entirety of the  Section 20(a) argument in the  Pattern Energy \nDefendants\u2019 Opening Brief:  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, \u201cplaintiffs must state with particularity the circumstances  of both the defendants\u2019 control of the \nprimary violator, as well as of the defendants\u2019 culpability as \ncontrolling persons.\u201d In re Digital Island  [Sec. Litig. , 223 F. Supp. \n2d 546, 561 (D. Del. 2002)] .  Plaintiffs plead neither.  A predicate \nelement of a section 20(a) claim is \u201cproof of a separate underlying violation of the  Exchange Act.\u201d   Id.  Plaintiffs plead no such \nviolation here for the reasons discussed above  [(i.e., failure to state \na Section 14(a) claim )], and  the 20(a) claim should be dismissed out \nof hand.  See id.  at 561\u201362; accord Laborers\u2019 Loc. #231 Pension \nFund v. Cowan, 300 F. Supp. 3d 597, 610 (D. Del. 2018); In re \nAetna, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 617 F.3d 272, 285 (3d Cir. 2010) (same). \n(D.I. 81 at 22.)  The Opening Brief did not distinguish between  the Individual Defendants even \nthough one of them \u2014Defendant Garland \u2014was the CEO of Pattern Energ y and signed the \nchallenged proxy statement . \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Answering Brief  pointed out that the Opening Brief \u201caddress[ed] none \u201d of the \nSAC\u2019s  allegations about \u201cthe involvement  of each Board and Officer Defendant \u201d and that \nDefendants \u201csimply contend [ed] that the Section 20(a) claim should be  dismissed because the SAC \npurportedly does not state a predicate Section 14(a) claim.\u201d   (D.I. 83 at 34 (emphasis in original) .)  \nThe Pattern Energy Defendants\u2019 Reply Brief responded  follows : \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Opposition confirms \n    \n \n19 \n C. Plaintiffs \u2019 state law claims should be dismissed  in accordance with the forum \nselection clause . \nCount  III alleges that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties under state \nlaw, and  Count IV alleges that Riverstone aided an d abetted the breaches .  The Court has \nsupplemental jurisdiction over Counts III and IV  under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.  The I ndividual \nDefendants and Riverstone argue that (1) the  state law claims should be dismissed because they \nare subject to a forum selection clause in Pattern Energy\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation that requires \nthem  to be filed  in the Delaware Court of Chance ry and (2)  the Court should nevertheless decline \nto exercise jurisdiction under \u00a7 1367(c) . \nI agree that Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims should be dismissed  in accordance with the forum \nselection clause.   \u201c[T]he appropriate way to enforce a forum -selection clause pointing to a state or \nforeign forum is through the doctrine of forum non conveniens .\u201d  Atl. Marine Const. Co. v. U.S. \nD. Ct. , 571 U.S. 49, 60 (2013).  When a court receives a request to dismiss based on  a forum \nselection clause, it must confront two threshold questions: (1) do the claims at issue fall within the \nscope of the clause ; and (2) is the clause enforceable.   Collins v. Mary Kay, Inc., 874 F.3d 176, \n180 (3d Cir. 2017) .  If an enforceable forum selection clause covers the claims at issue, it should \nbe given effect \u201c[i]n all but the most unusual cases .\u201d  Atl. Marine,  571 U.S. at 66; Collins , 874 \nF.3d at 186\u2013187. \n \n(Opp. at 34) that the sole predicate for their Section 20(a)  claim is their Section 14(a) claim, the \nfailures of which are addressed above and in the Opening  Brief.  Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 20(a) should \nbe dismissed based on those same failures. \u201d  (D.I. 87 at 10.)  The Reply Brief did n ot argue  that \nthe SAC failed to  adequately plead the Individual Defendants\u2019 culpability as controlling persons.  \nNor did the Reply Brief  deny the Answering Brief \u2019s assertion  that Defendants\u2019 only argument for \ndismissing the Section 20(a) claim was the failure to plead a predicate Section 14(a) violation.    \nUnder these circumstances, the Court declines to entertain the argument that the Section \n20(a) claims should be dismissed on the basis that the  SAC fails to plead the Individual \nDefendants\u2019 culpability as  controlling persons.     \n \n20 \n Plaintiffs do not argue that the clause does not encompass  the state law  claims  set forth in \nCounts III and IV .8  They do argue that the clause is unenforceable.  The Third Circuit says that \nwhether a forum selection clause is enforceable is determined by federal law.   Collins , 874 F.3d at \n181.  The Third Circuit ha s also stated that  such a  clause  is unenforceable only if \u201c the party \nobjecting to its enforcement establishes (1) that it is the result of fraud or over -reaching, (2) that \nenforcement would violate a strong public policy of the forum  [in which the suit was  brought] , or \n(3) that enforcement would in the particular circumstances of the case result in litigation in a \njurisdiction so seriously inconvenient as to be unreasonable.\u201d   Coastal Steel Corp. v. Tilghman \nWheelabrator Ltd., 709 F.2d 190, 202 (3d Cir. 1983)  (citing The Bremen v. Zapata Off -Shore Co. , \n407 U.S. 1, 10\u201311 (1972)) , overruled on other grounds by Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser , 490 U.S. \n495 (1989); see also Collins , 874 F.3d at 181.   \n \n8 Pattern Energy\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation  provide s, in \npertinent part : \nUnless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an \nalternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware \nshall, to the fullest exte nt permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive \nforum for (A) any \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d within the meaning of the DGCL and  (B) . . . (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of \na fiduciary duty owed by, or other wr ongdoing by, any director, \nofficer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation\u2019s stockholders . . . ; provided, that, if and only if the \nCourt of Chancery of  the State of Delaware dismisses any such \naction for lack of subjec t matter jurisdiction, such action may be \nbrought in another state court sitting in the State of Delaware. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the \nCorpora tion shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the \nprovisions of this Article . . . . \n(D.I. 82, Ex. A at 3.)   Plaintiffs do not dispute that Delaware law permits Delaware corporations \nto include such clauses  in their internal governing documents.  See 8 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(b)(1) , 115;\n \nSalzberg v. Sciabacucchi , 227 A.3d 102, 116\u2013120 (Del. 2020) ; Boilermakers Loc. 154 Ret. Fund \nv. Chevron Corp., 73 A.3d 934, 950\u201354 (Del. Ch. 2013). \n Plaintiffs do not dispute that their aiding and abetting claim against Riverstone is covered \nby the clause.     \n \n21 \n Plaintiffs do not  contend that the forum selection clause here resulted from \u201cfraud or \noverreaching\u201d or that litigating its state law claims in the Court of Chancery (a few blocks away ) \n\u201cis so seriously inconvenient  as to be unreasonable.\u201d  Coastal Steel , 709 F.2d at 202.  Plaintiffs \nsuggest  in a footnote that th ere is a public policy \u201cthat an exclusive forum provision should not be \nenforced when the forum lacks subject -matter jurisdiction over all claims\u201d that plaintiff wishes to \nbring (D.I. 83 at 35 n.16) , but none of the authority cited by Plaintiffs reveals an y such policy .9 \nPlaintiffs essentially contend that the forum selection clause should be held  unenforceable  \nin this case because they want to assert federal Exchange Act claims , and they can\u2019t bring those \nclaims in state court.  I reject that argument.  For one thing, the clause  here does not appear to \nrequire  shareholders  to bring direct Exchange Act  claims in state court  (which lacks jurisdiction  \nover such claims , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa ), and the parties do not argue otherwise .10  Plaintiffs\u2019 inability \nto bring federal securities claims in state court has nothing to do with the enforceability of  the \nclause  as to the ir state law claims .   \nPlaintiffs say it would be  \u201cunreasonable\u201d to require them to litigate their federal and state \nclaims in two separate courts.  But none of the cases cited by Plaintiff support that proposition.  \nAnd I don\u2019t think it is unreasonable  to require Plaintiffs to litigate their state law cl aims in state \ncourt  and their federal claims  in this Court .  See Luce v. Edelstein , 802 F.2d 49, 57 (2d Cir. 1986) \n(affirming district court\u2019s dismissal of most claims due to a forum selection clause providing for \n \n9 On the contrary, the Boilermakers  case cited by Plaintiffs acknowledged a scenario in \nwhich  a forum selection clause might  operate to  require  a plaintiff to litigate its  state law internal \naffairs claims  in state court but litigate its federal securities claims in federal court .  73 A.3d at \n962\u201363.  \n \n10 In Boilermakers , the Delaware Court of Chancery examined a nearly identical clause \nand suggested (in dicta) that \u201ca claim by a stockholder under federal law for falsely soliciting \nproxies\u201d would not fall under the clause.  73 A.3d at 942, 962.    \n \n22 \n state court jurisdiction but agreeing that  the district court correctly retained the Exchange Act \nclaims); see also KDH Consulting Grp. LLC v. Iterative Capital Mgmt., No. 20- 3274, 2020 WL \n7251172, at * 8\u20139 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2020) .  What would be unreasonable would be to allow a \nplaintiff to entir ely disregard a valid forum selection clause simply by asserting additional claims \nnot subject to the clause.  See  Del Aguila v. Genentech -Roche Transitional Benefit Plan, No. 14-\n4265, 2015 WL 2089636, at *2 (N.D. Cal. May 4, 2015)  (\u201c[I]f courts were unabl e to order such \npartial dismissals  [of claims subject to a forum selection clause] , a plaintiff could effectively \nnullify a contractual provision for an agreed upon forum simply by adding a claim not covered \nthereun der.\u201d).   \n Because the  forum selection cl ause requires Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims  to be litigated in \nthe Court of Chancery (which indisputably has jurisdiction over them) , the clause should control \nunless Plaintiffs can establish that this is one of those \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases where  \nfactors relevant to the public interest weigh against  it.11  Collins , 874 F.3d at 186.  Plaintiffs argue \nthat the \u201cpublic interest in judicial economy \u201d tilts the scale in support of this Court  entertaining  all \nits claims .  I disagree.   The Court need not consider  whether there  could  ever be a  case in which a \nfederal court would entertain  state law claims subject to a state court forum selection clause in the \nname of \u201cjudicial economy \u201d because  this is certainly  not such a  case.  Here , judicial economy \n \n11 \u201cPublic -interest factors may include \u2018the administrative difficulties flowing from court \ncongestion; the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home; [and] the interest \nin having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at hom e with the law.\u2019\u201d  Atl.

Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 241 n.6 (1981)); see also In re \nHowmedica Osteonics Corp, 867 F.3d 390, 402 n.7 (3d Cir. 2017) (\u201c[W]e clarify that \u2018practical \nproblems that make trial of  a case easy, expeditious, and inexpensive\u2019 represent a private interest, \nas the Supreme Court stated in Atlantic Marine , and as we have often stated in the forum non \nconveniens  context, [] we acknowledge judicial economy considerations to be a distinct, \ncognizable public interest.\u201d (citations omitted)). \n    \n \n23 \n supports requiring Plaintiffs to litigate their state law claims in the Court of Chancery because a \nconsolidated shareholder action alleging nearly identical  breach of fiduciary duty and ai ding and \nabetting claims is already pending there .12  See In re Pattern Energy Grp. Inc. Stockholders Litig., \nNo. 2020- 357-MTZ (Del. Ch.).  Judicial economy is not promoted by this court hearing duplicative \nclaims . \n Finally, Plaintiffs suggest that l itigat ing their federal and state claims in two different courts \nwould be \u201c inconvenien[t]\u201d  for them .  (D.I. 83 a t 35 n.16.)  Maybe so, but courts are not permitted \nto consider  the private interests of a party opposing enforcement of a forum selection clause.   \nCollins , 874 F.3d at 186; see also  Phillips v. Audio Active Ltd. , 494 F.3d 378, 393 (2d Cir. 2007)  \n(concluding that it was appropriate to dismiss claim subject to forum select ion clause and retain \nclaims not subject to clause, notwithstanding inconvenience to the parties  to litigate in two fora ).   \nI agree with Defendants that the forum selection clause should be enforced  as to Counts III \nand IV.13  Those counts should be dismissed.  \n \n12 Indeed, it appears that most of the new factual allegations in the SAC were obtained from \nthe state court  complaint  and the Court of Chancery\u2019s voluminous  opinion granting- in-part and \ndenying- in-part a m otion to dismiss filed by Defendants in that action.  In re Pattern Energy Grp. \nInc. S\u2019holders Litig., No. 2020- 0357- MTZ, 2021 WL 1812674, at *2 (Del. Ch. May 6, 2021) .  (See \nD.I. 81 at 12\u201313; D.I. 83 at 1.)  \n \n13 Because Counts III and IV are appropriately dismissed based on the forum selection \nclause, the Court need not separately address  Defendants\u2019 alternative argument that the Court \nshould decline to exercise jurisdiction over those claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c).  That \nsaid, the fact that  nearly identical  shareholder claims against the same defendants are already being \nlitigated  in the Court of Chancery weighs in favor of declining discretionary jurisdiction.  \nMoreover, some courts have reasoned that the fact that a claim is subject to dismissal for forum \nnon conveniens would be an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d that would support declining jurisdiction \npursuant to \u00a7 1367(c)(4).

Kan. 2010) ; \nIn re Air Cargo Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig., No. 06- 1775, 2008 WL 5958061, at *37 (E.D.N.Y. \nSept. 26, 2008), report and recommendation adopted in part , 2009 WL 3443405 (E.D.N.Y.

CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend  as follows: t he Pattern Energy Defendants\u2019 Motion \nto Dismiss (D.I. 78) should be GRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART ; and R iverstone\u2019s \nMotion to Dismiss (D.I. 79) should be GRANTED.  The Pattern Energy Defendants\u2019 requests to \ndismiss Counts I and II should be denied, and those claims  should proceed in this Court .  \nDefendants\u2019  requests to dismiss Counts III and IV should be granted, and those claims  should be \ndismissed without prejudice .   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.  Any \nobjections to the Report and Recommendation shall be filed within fourteen days and limited to ten pages.   Any response shall be filed within fourteen days thereafter and limited to ten pages. \nThe failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo \nreview in the district court.  \nThe parties  are directed to the Court\u2019s \u201cStanding Order for Objections Filed Under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72,\u201d dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which can be found on the Court\u2019s website.  \n \nDated:  January 27, 2022    ___________________________________ \n The Honorable Jennifer L.
