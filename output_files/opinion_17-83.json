Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993), the\nSupreme Court explained that Federal Rule of Evidence 702 creates \"a gatekeeping role for the\n[trial] judge\" in order to \"ensur[e] that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation\nand is relevant to the task at hand.\" Rule 702(a) requires that expert testimony \"help the trier of\nfact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Expert testimony is admissible\nonly if \"the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data,\" \"the testimony is the product of\nreliable principles and methods,\" and \"the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods\nto the facts of the case.\" Fed. R. Evid. 702(b)-(d).\nThere are three distinct requirements for proper expert testimony: (1) the expert must be\nqualified; (2) the opinion must be reliable; and (3) the expert's opinion must relate to the\nfacts. See Elcock v. Kmart Corp., 233 F.3d 734, 741 (3d Cir. 2000).\nSummary Judgmeut\nPursuant to Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"[t]he court shall grant\nsummary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" The moving party bears the burden\nof demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus.\nCo., Ltd. V. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-87, 585 n.lO (1986). An assertion that a fact\ncannot be - or, altematively, is - genuinely disputed must be supported either by \"citing to\nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored\ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the\nmotion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials\" or by \"showing that the\nmaterials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse\n2party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) &\n(B). If the moving party has carried its burden, the nonmovant must then \"come forward with\nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587\n(internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). The Court will \"draw all reasonable inferences\nin favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the\nevidence.\" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133,150 (2000).\nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must \"do more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\" Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586; see also Podobnik v. U.S. Postal Serv., 409 F.3d 584, 594 (3d Cir. 2005) (stating\nparty opposing summary judgment \"must present more than just bare assertions, conclusory\nallegations or suspicions to show the existence of a genuine issue\") (internal quotation marks\nomitted), abrogated on other grounds by Rotkiske v. Klemm, 890 F.3d 422 (3d Cir. 2018). The\n\"mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise\nproperly supported motion for summary judgment.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., All U.S.\n242,247-48 (1986). A factual dispute is genuine only where \"the evidence is such that a\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. at 248. \"If the evidence is\nmerely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\" Id. at\n249-50 (internal citations omitted); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, All U.S. 317, 322 (1986)\n(stating entry of summary judgment is mandated \"against a party who fails to make a showing\nsufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that\nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial\"). Thus, the \"mere existence of a scintilla of\nevidence\" in support of the nonmoving party's position is insufficient to defeat a motion for\nsummary judgment. Anderson, All U.S. at 252. To defeat the motion, \"there must be evidence\non which the jury could reasonably find\" for the nonmoving party. Id.\n3DISCUSSION\nDaubert Motions\nPlaintiffs' Motion (D.L 519) To Exclude Dr. Jeffay's \"Check Data\" Construction\nPlaintiffs move to exclude Dr. Kevin Jeffay's testimony regarding the \"check data\"\nlimitation, arguing it is inconsistent with the intrinsic record and with this Court's construction of\nthe term. (D.I. 520 at 2-3) Plaintiffs contend that Defendant seeks through Dr. Jeffay to renew\nits unsuccessful argument that \"check data\" should be construed narrowly as being used for\ndetecting but not correcting errors.^ (Id.)\nThe Court previously construed \"check data\" as meaning \"supplementary data for use in\nchecking for transmission errors.\" (D.1.484 at 7-8) (emphasis added) Although the Court\ndeclined to adopt Defendant's construction, which substituted the term \"detecting\" for \"checking\nfor,\" the Court did not consider at the Markman stage whether \"checking for\" differs from\n\"detecting\" or whether - as Plaintiffs assert - \"checking for\" encompasses both detecting and\ncorrecting. (See id.) These issues were not raised by the parties; instead, the Court's focus\nduring Markman was on whether \"check data\" had to be a short-hand representation of the\noriginal data. (See id.)\nThe Court refines its construction of \"check data\" as used in claim 1 of the '662 patent to\nclarify that \"check data\" does not preclude error correction. This is consistent with the Court's\nprevious construction, which implicitly rejected Defendant's narrowing construction, which\nwould have limited \"check data\" merely to \"detection,\" without allowing for the possibility also\n^ Defendant clarified its position in its opposition brief, stating it is \"not arguing that\nerror correction and detection are mutually exclusive, or that the claims do not allow for error\ncorrection when performed in conjunction with the claimed error detection.\" (D.I. 573 at 3)\nThis position appears to be inconsistent with Dr. Jeffay's opinion that \"the '662 patent only\nproposes a method for detecting ... errors, but not for correcting them.\" (D.I. 521 Ex. 33 If 64)\n4of error correction. Plaintiffs point to persuasive evidence from the specification (see '662\npatent at 6:36-57) (depicting, in one embodiment, an example of error correction and detection)\nand file history {see D.I. 521 Ex. 34 at 187,289) (Examiner pointing to \"error correction\" as\nnon-limiting example of \"error checking\" in two prior art references) suggesting that the patentee\ndid not intend to limit error checking to error detecting.\nIn light of this clarified construction. Dr. Jeffay's testimony, which asserts that the '662\npatent is not at all directed to error correction, is inconsistent with the Court's claim construction.\nThe Court, therefore, grants Plaintiffs' motion.\nPlaintiffs' Motion (D.1.519) To Exclude Dr. Jeffay's\n\"Modify the Permutation in Time\" Construction\nPlaintiffs move to exclude Dr. Jeffay's testimony regarding the \"modify the permutation\nin time\" limitation, arguing it is inconsistent with the Court's construction of the term. (D.l. 520\nat 4-5) The Court previously construed \"modify the permutation in time\" as meaning \"change\nthe permutation from time to time,\" precisely as Plaintiffs had proposed. (D.l. 484 at 8-9)\n(emphasis added)\nPlaintiffs argue that Dr. Jeffay's opinion that claim 2 of the '662 patent requires the\ndevice to \"consider the passage of time\" has been rejected by the Court; instead, all that is\nrequired is that the permutation be configured to change. (D.l. 520 at 4) Defendant responds\nthat Dr. Jeffay has only applied the Court's construction to rebut the opinion of Plaintiffs'\nexpert, which Defendant argues removes the \"from time to time\" requirement by opining that the\nclaims only require a varying device capable of changing the permutation. (D.l. 573 at 3-5) In\nDefendant's view. Dr. Jeffay's opinion simply explains why the \"from time to time\" limitation is\nnot \"superfluous\" (Tr. at 70), adding that in the two embodiments cited in the Court's Markman\nopinion, \"the device measures the passage of time by counting the number of bits processed\n5(every n bits), or tracking changes in the data packet index {e.g., channel number, sequence\nnumber, or time indication)\" (D.I. 573 at 4).\nWith respect to this term. Dr. Jeffay is applying the Court's construction rather than\ncontradicting it. See Align Tech., Inc. v. 3Shape A/S, 2021 WL 534903, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 12,\n2021) (\"While an expert witness is not allowed to deviate from the Court's claim construction,\nhe is allowed to provide opinions reflecting the application of the Court's claim construction to\nthe facts of this case.\"). There is, thus, no basis to exclude his opinion. Plaintiffs' motion is\ndenied.\nDefendant's Motion (D.L 529) To Exclude Dr. Madisetti's Willfulness Opinions\nDefendant argues that Dr. Vijay Madisetti improperly opines on Defendant's state of\nmind and the ultimate issue of willfulness, so his testimony should be excluded. (D.I. 530 at 15-\n16) Dr. Madisetti concludes, for example, that HTC was aware of the '662 patent as early as\n(D.I. 572 He further\nstates that he was \"not aware of any basis by which any Defendant reasonably could have\nunderstood that its [i]nfringing '662 [pjroducts did not infringe the '662 [pjatent.\" {Id. 1110)\nAdditionally, he opines that if the infringing products comply with the relevant standards, and\nthe '662 patent is standard essential, it follows that Defendant willfully infringed the '662 patent.\n{Id. nil 101-10)\nNotwithstanding Plaintiffs' representation during oral argument that they would not seek\nto have Dr. Madisetti give a willfulness opinion at trial,^ the Court deems it still necessary to\n^ Plaintiffs, for the first time during oral argument, committed to not asking Dr. Madisetti\nquestions such as, \"did [Defendant] willfully infringe?\" or \"[d]o you think [Defendant] willfully\ninfringed?\" (Tr. at 154)grant the motion. Dr. Madisetti's opinions are not merely \"technical,\" as Plaintiffs suggest.\n(D.I. 571 at 28) Rather, they opine on his understanding of Defendant's state of mind, or what\nDefendant \"reasonably could have understood,\" and on the ultimate issue of willfulness. (See\nD.I. 530 at 15) These opinions both exceed Dr. Madisetti's expertise and invade the province of\nthe jury. See Zimmer Surgical, Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 365 F. Supp. 3d 466,497 (D. Del. 2019)\n(\"Expert testimony as to ... state of mind offers no more than the drawing of an inference from\nthe facts of the case ... and permitting expert testimony on this subject would be merely\nsubstituting the expert's judgment for the jury's.\").\nPlaintiffs suggest that, as in Bombardier Recreational Products Inc. v. Arctic Cat Inc.,\n2017 WL 758335, at *4-5 (D. Minn. Feb. 24,2017), their expert's opinion on willful\ninfringement should be permitted, in order to \"provid[e] context for the jury's decision regarding\nwillfulness.\" (D.I. 571 at 29) In Bombardier, the Court determined that expert testimony would\naid the jury in understanding technical evidence regarding the snowmobile industry that was\nrelevant to the plaintiffs theory that \"copying\" had occurred. 2017 WL 758335, at *4. Here,\nhowever. Dr. Madisetti does not have any particular expertise about HTC's state of mind that\nsets him apart from a lay juror; his opinion on these issues will not be helpful to the jury.\nDefendant's Motion (D.L 529) To Exclude\nDr. Madisetti's \"Single Interleaver\" Opinions\nDefendant moves to exclude testimony from Dr. Madisetti's rebuttal report that, in its\nview, contends the claimed varying device is limited to a single interleaver. (D.I. 530 at 16-19)\n(citing D.I. 533-1 Ex. 10 Tflf 287-93) Specifically, HTC points to Dr. Madisetti's statement that\n^ Even assuming what HTC \"should have known\" is relevant to the willfulness inquiry after\nHalo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., 579 U.S. 93 (2016), see Arctic Cat Inc. v.\nBombardier Recreational Products Inc., 876 F.3d 1350,1371 (Fed. Cir. 2017), Plaintiffs can\nconvey substantially the same information about KPN's communications with HTC through fact\nwitnesses.\n7claim 2 \"requires the presence of a single, multi-permutation varying device that is capable of\nchanging from time to time the permutation.\" (D.I. 533-1 Ex. 10 If 289) Defendant asserts that\nDr. Madisetti has applied a new claim construction that contradicts this Court's construction,\nwhich never limited the claimed varying device to one interleaver. (D.!. 530 at 17)\nIn response, Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Madisetti only opined that there is at least one\ninterleaver, acknowledging that the varying device may comprise one or more interleavers. (D.I.\n571 at 30-31, 33) The Court agrees. Read in context. Dr. Madisetti's statements suggest that the\nvarying device can, but need not, include multiple interleavers, which in his view distinguishes\nthe invention from the prior art. {See, e.g., D.I. 533-1 Ex. 10 ^ 291) (explaining that Dr. Jeffay\ndid not suggest that Barbulescu prior art reference \"obviate[d] the need for a device to include\nmultiple interleavers - the core inventive element of [c]laim 2\") The Court is not convinced that\nDr. Madisetti's opinions construe the claims as requiring a single interleaver. Therefore, they are\nnot inconsistent with the Court's construction. Defendant's motion is denied.\nDefendant's Motion (D.L 529) To Exclude Dr. Madisetti's\n\"Be Able To Apply More Than One Permutation\" Opinions\nDefendant argues that Dr. Madisetti's opinions are inconsistent with the Court's\nconstruction of \"modify the permutation in time\" in claim 2 as meaning \"change the permutation\nfrom time to time.\" (D.L 530 at 19-20) In Defendant's view, the opinions read out the \"in time\"\nrequirement, suggesting the claim is satisfied if the device is merely \"able to apply more than\none permutation.\" {Id.)\nPlaintiffs note that the Court agreed that claim 2 can be met by changing the permutation\nas a function of time or based on the varying of the data. {See D.I. 484 at 9) (\"[T]he Court\nagrees with Plaintiffs that their proposed construction is supported by the specification language\nthat the permutation (1) can 'be varied every n bits, where n is > 1' and (2) 'can be varied on the\n8basis of one or more parameters of the data packet' to 'accomplish a varying, i.e., time-\ndependent checking function.'\") (quoting D.I. 438 at 29, 36)\nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Dr. Madisetti's opinions are not clearly inconsistent\nwith its construction. Therefore, the Court denies Defendant's motion.\nSummary Judgment Motions\nDefendant's Motion For Summary Judgment\n(\"MSJ\") (D.L 529) Of No Direct Infringement\nDefendant moves for summary judgment of no direct infringement on the ground that the\naccused devices, as imported and sold, lack the claimed \"varying device\" that is \"further\nconfigured to modify the permutation in time.\" (D.I. 530 at 1) (citing '662 patent at cl. 2) There\ndoes not appear to be any genuine dispute of material fact as to how the accused products work.\n(^See Tr. at 12, 56-59) It is undisputed that when the devices are sold, they are not connected to a\nnetwork and, without that connection, they cannot perform the claimed functionality. (See id. at\n14,23) That is, in order for the accused devices to modify the permutation in time, the user must\nfirst connect the devices to a cellular network, and that network must send interleaver\nconfiguration parameters to the accused devices.^ (See D.I. 530 at 1-2; Tr. at 12,14, 56-57)\nThe parties dispute whether, as a matter of law, the need for the accused devices to\nundergo this two-step process before they possess the accused functionality precludes those\ndevices from meeting the \"configured to\" limitation.^ (See Tr. at 12, 57) The Federal Circuit has\n^ Defendant further explained that the network determines which network resources to allocate to\nthe device and sends back an uplink grant specifying this information. (See Tr. at 13) For\ncertain networks, including the three accused networks (W-CDMA, CDMA-2000, and LTE), the\nuplink grant includes the interleaver configuration parameters. (See id.)\n^ Plaintiffs acknowledge that the phrase \"configured to\" in the '662 patent has the same meaning\nas in the relevant Federal Circuit cases relied upon by both parties. (See Tr. at 41)construed \"configured to\" as meaning \"programmed to.\" See Nevro Corp. v. Bos. Sci. Corp.,\n955 F.3d 35,40-42 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\"[W]e construe 'configured to' to mean 'programmed\nto.'\"). If an accused product is capable of performing the claimed function but must be modified\nbefore it can do so, it will not meet a \"configured to\" limitation. See Typhoon Touch Techs., Inc.\nV. Dell, Inc., 659 F.3d 1376,1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2011); see also Telemac Cellular Corp. v. Topp\nTelecom, Inc., 247 F.3d 1316,1330 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\"[TJhat a device is capable of being\nmodified to operate in an infringing manner is not sufficient, by itself, to support a finding of\ninfringement\").\nPlaintiffs concede that the Federal Circuit has made this point clear. {See Tr. at 34) But\nthey distinguish between a device that merely has the capability of being configured to perform\nthe claimed function (which would not infringe) and a device that is already configured to have\nthe capability to perform the claimed function (which would infnnge, in their view). {Id. at 34-\n35) Plaintiffs rely on Chrimar Holding Co., LLC v. ALE USA Inc., 732 F. App'x 876, 879 (Fed.\nCir. 2018), for the proposition that a \"configured to\" limitation requires only that a device \"have\nthe ability\" to act as claimed. {See D.I. 571 at 3-4) The term \"configured to,\" however, was not\nat issue in Chrimar. There, the district court had construed the term \"physically connect\" to\nrequire that \"the components be configured (have the ability) to physically coimect, rather than\nactually be physically cormected.\" Chrimar, 732 F. App'x at 885 (emphasis omitted). The\nCourt arrived at this conclusion by comparing the term \"physically connect\" in independent\nclaim 1 with a limitation in a dependent claim requiring that certain pairs of conductors \"are\nphysically connected.\" Id. Applying the doctrine of claim differentiation, the Court determined,\nin that particular context, that claim 1 was directed to capability, rather than actual operation.\nSee id. Chrimar does not, however, establish the broad proposition that \"configured to\" is\nnecessarily satisfied when a device merely \"has the ability\" to act as claimed.\n10In the Court's view, the relevant question is whether the receipt of parameters from the\nnetwork is a modification of the devices that would preclude a finding of infiingement\nDefendant argues that the term \"configured to\" requires the accused devices to have all the\nstructural components (in this case, the code, hardware, and parameters) necessary to perform\nthe claimed function as sold without modification. {See Tr. at 20-22) Since the \"parameters are\nclearly not part of the accused device\" at the time the devices are sold, in Defendant's view this\nissue is \"clear.\" {Id. at 43) For Plaintiffs, the issue is equally \"cut and dry,\" as the \"accused\ndevices standing alone have the software installed on them\" at the time they are sold, and that\ncode is \"not changed in any way by the network.\" {Id. at 28-31)\nAs to this dispute, a few cases from the Federal Circuit are instructive. For example, in\nNevro, 955 F.3d at 41, which Defendant cited for the first time during oral argument, the Court\nconstrued \"configured to generate\" to require \"programming the signal generator (i.e., setting\nparameters) to generate the claimed signals.\" The claims at issue explicitly contemplated\nspecific parameters, claiming, for example, \"[a] spinal cord modulation system comprising a\nsignal generator configured to generate a therapy signal having a frequency of 10 kHz, an\namplitude up to 6 mA, and p[ul]ses having a pulse width between 30 microseconds and 35\nmicroseconds.\" Id. at 40 (emphasis omitted). Relying on this specific claim language and the\npatent specification, the Court concluded that programming the claimed signal generator required\nsetting the claimed parameters. See id. at 41. Here, however, the asserted claims do not\ncontemplate that \"configured to modify the permutation in time\" requires setting particular\nparameters. Moreover, the plaintiff in Nevro argued that \"configured to\" means \"designed to,\"\nwhich the Federal Circuit rejected. Id. at 41-42. Plaintiffs make no such argument here; rather,\nthey contend that the accused products already contain the necessary software and require no\nfurther configuration.\n11By contrast, Nozomi Communications, Inc. v. Nokia Corp., 739 F.Sd 1339,1345 (Fed.\nCir. 2014), involved accused devices that required a user to purchase and install software onto\nthem before the devices would possess the claimed functionality. The Federal Circuit held that\nthis purchase and installation \"clearly constitute[d] a 'modification' of the accused products\" that\nprecluded a finding of infringement. Id. The Court further characterized the software\ninstallation as \"not imlocking existing functionality, but adding new functionality not currently\npresent.\" Id. at 1346; see also TQ Delta, LLC v. ADTRAN, Inc., 2019 WL 4277026, at *4 (D.\nDel. Sept. 10,2019) (finding chipset capable of operating in infringing manner only if customer\naffirmatively enabled pre-programmed settings did not meet \"operable to\" requirement).\nIn M2MSolutions LLC v. Sierra Wireless America, Inc., 2020 WL 7767639, at *13 (D.\nDel. Dec. 4,2020), report and recommendation adopted by C.A. No. 14-1102-RGA D.I. 214\n(Mar. 31,2021), the Court held that the claimed \"configured to use a memory\" limitation was\nmet even where the accused products were sold without all of the structure necessary to meet that\nlimitation. In M2MSolutions, it was undisputed that the accused products were sold without\nSIM cards and could only meet the limitation at issue if the user inserted one. See id. at * 12. In\nfinding that the accused products nonetheless infringed, the Court noted that \"the non-SIM\nproducts are designed to operate with SIM cards in this manner, and no new functionality is\nrequired to utilize the SIM card.\" M at *13. The Court was persuaded that the insertion of a\nSIM card simply activated the device's existing functionality, akin to pressing an \"ON\" button.\nId.\nLikewise, in the instant case, the Court concludes that the receipt of parameters from the\nnetwork is more akin to \"unlocking existing functionality\" (i.e., pressing an \"ON\" button) than\n\"adding new functionality\" (i.e., modifying the device). Nozomi, 739 F.3d at 1346. The record\nreflects that the \"accused devices standing alone have the software installed on them\" when sold,\n12and that the code is \"not changed in any way by the network.\" (Tr. at 28-31; see also id. at 39\n(describing what network sends to device as \"an informational message\")) In describing the\naccused products, Plaintiffs' Dr. Madisetti stated that \"the varying device is further configured\n(without being rebuilt, recoded, or redesigned) such that it is able to modify the permutation it\napplies from time to time.\" {See D.I. 571 at 2) (citing D.I. 572 Ex. 37 at 78) Defendant's Dr.\nJeffay agreed with this understanding, stating, \"I have seen nothing showing that the network\ncauses the accused products to modify the configuration parameters for the interleaver.\" {Id. at 3\nn.4 (citing D.I. 572 Ex. 41 240); see also Tr. at 35)\nDefendant's reference to In re Certain Digital Media Devices, Inv. No. 337-TA-882,\nInitial Det. (ITC Aug. 7,2014), does not alter the Court's conclusion. {See D.I. 585 at 2; see also\nD.I. 596-97) In that case, the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") determined that allegedly\ninfringing tablets were not \"configured to\" perform the accused functionality until the user took\nseveral additional steps, including \"accepting the terms and conditions of use, connecting the\ndevice to a local area network [connected to a second device], accessing a content server over the\nInternet, and registering and paying for services.\" (D.I. 597 Ex. A at 19,131) Further, the\nclaims in that case required performance of certain actions \"without user input.\" {Id. at 24-25)\nAccordingly, the ITC concluded that the accused tablets were not \"configured to\" perform the\naccused functionality and, thus, did not infiinge. As Plaintiffs note, the '662 patent contains no\nautonomous requirement, and the accused devices need not undergo a long list of steps or\nconnect with a second device before they can perform the accused functionality. {See Tr. at 32)^\n^ Plaintiffs point io Apple Inc. v. Wi-LANInc., 25 F.4th 960 (Fed. Cir. 2022), in which the\nFederal Circuit relied on testimony from Dr. Madisetti in a somewhat similar context. {See D.I.\n609) In Apple, the Federal Circuit rejected Apple's argument that its accused phones could not\ninfringe as sold because they did not have the required \"user connections\" until the user\nconnected to a cellular network. 25 F.4th at 970. The Court pointed to Dr. Madisetti's testimony\nfor the plaintiff in the case as part of the substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that a\n13jto sum, having ccmsidered Ihe relevant authority, as well as testiinony from experts on\nboth sides, the Court finds that a reascmabie jury could coiKslude tibat the accused functionality is\npresent in the accused produchi, wifrunxt any required modification.

A at 7309)\nconnection to a cellular network was not required to satisfy die '^user connections\" requirement.\nId. While Dr. hkdisetti's testimony in that case may bear some resemblance to his testimony in\ntiiis case, die Court agre^ widi HTC that die ccmtext here is materially drfferent. (See DX 610)\nWhile Apple does not particularly hefy Pkintiffr hme, it certainly does not detract from the\nCourt's conclusion. Defendant's requ^ (see id.) that the Court strike Plaintiffr' Notice of\nSiq^lemental Authority (see DX 609) is cknied The Court finds no violation of Delaware\nLocal Pule 7.1.2(b) an^ instead, has found both parties' discussion of the Apple case helpfid to\nits evaluation of the motion.\n14HTC argues that Section 2.5 recites an \"unconditionar' covenant not to sue that\nauthorized its sales from October 30,2009 to (D.I. 525 at 2-3) By contrast.\nPlaintiffs argue that the plain language of Section 2.5 provides only that KPN cannot initiate\nproceedings asserting the '662 patent until after the 2009 Agreement expires. (D.I. 571 at 18)\nIn TramCore, LP v. Electronic Transaction Consultants Corp., 563 F.3d 1271,1275\n(Fed. Cir. 2009), the Federal Circuit stated: \"this court and its predecessors have on numerous\noccasions explained that a non-exclusive patent license is equivalent to a covenant not to sue.\"\nThere, the clause at issue provided that TransCore had agreed \"not to bring any demand, claim,\nlawsuit, or action ... for future infringement. .. for the entire remainder of the terms of the\nrespective [patents].\" Id. at 1273. Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish TransCore by arguing that the\nFederal Circuit characterized the clause at issue there as \"unconditional,\" whereas Section 2.5 is\nbetter characterized as a \"temporary\" covenant not to sue. (D.I. 571 at 18-19) It is true that the\nTransCore Court noted: \"[t]he question for this court is whether an unconditional covenant not to\nsue authorizes sales by the covenantee for purposes of patent exhaustion.\" 563 F.3d at 1274.\nWhen describing the covenant not to sue as \"imconditional,\" however, the Federal Circuit\nfocused on the fact that the grantee \"did not, as it could have, limit this authorization to, for\nexample, 'making' or 'using.'\" Id. at 1276. Instead, the grantee used the more general term\n\"infringement.\" See id. It is undisputed that Section 2.5 encompasses sales, |\n(D.I. 526 Ex. A at 7309)\nFurther, even if the Court agreed with Plaintiffs that Section 2.5 is not \"unconditional,\"\n^st-TransCore cases have not drawn a hard line between imconditional and conditional\ncovenants not to sue, in concluding that such covenants are equivalent to a non-exclusive patent\nlicense. For example, in Vectura Ltd. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC, 2019 WL 1352767 (D. Del. Mar.\n26,2019), the Court considered a time-limited covenant not to initiate suit very similar to\n15Section 2.5. Applying TransCore, the Court concluded that the covenant authorized the\nlicensee's conduct until the covenant expired, insulating the licensee from a damages claim for\nthe period the agreement was in effect. See id. at *3.\nPlaintiffs are correct that Section 2.5, on its face, does not explicitly provide that KPN\n\"would never assert an infringement claim for HTC products that HTC sold during the term of\nthe agreement.\" (Tr. at 83) (emphasis added) But TransCore is strong support for HTC's\ninterpretation of Section 2.5 as a covenant not to sue that authorized HTC's sales through\n|. As the Federal Circuit put it in TransCore, 563 F.3d at 1276, \"[t]he real question,\nthen, is not whether an agreement is framed in terms of a 'covenant not to sue' or a 'license.'\nThat difference is only one of form, not substance - both are properly viewed as\n'authorizations.'\" It follows, here, that Section 2.5 is properly viewed as KPN's \"authorization\"\nof HTC to sell products during the term of the parties' agreement, i.e., throughl\nThe Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that a reading of the 2009 Agreement\nas a whole compels a different conclusion. See Wood v. Capita Ins. Servs. Ltd. [2017] UKSC 24\n(holding that, when performing contract interpretation. Court \"must consider the contract as a\nwhole\").\u00ae The distinction between Section 2.1,|\nand Section 2.5, a covenant not to sue , does not\nchange the fact that Section 2.5 is a covenant not to sue that the Court is required under the law\nto treat as equivalent to a non-exclusive patent license. (See Tr. at 74-75) Although it is not\nto do has why\nid.)\n\u00ae The Court cites this case from the U.K. Supreme Court, as Article 12.1 sets out that U.K. law\ngoverns the 2009 Agreement. (D.I. 526 Ex. A at 7318)\n16Furthermore, Section 4.1\n(See D.I. 571 at 20) Plaintiffs posit that applying HTC's\nreading of Section 2.5 would lead to the \"bizarre result\" thati\n1. (Id.) HTC agrees this is the result of the correct\ninterpretation of the parties' contract, but characterizes it as making \"business sense,\" for reasons\nincluding that|\n1. Tr. at 93-94) Regardless ofhow one describes this\noutcome, it is the outcome required by the only reasonable reading of the contract, which favors\nDefendant.\nFinally, the Court has considered the parties' arguments related to Sections 4.2 and 6.5\n(see e.g., D.I. 525 at 3-4; D.I. 571 at 20-21), and they do not alter the Court's conclusion.\nBecause the Court concludes that Section 2.5 authorized HTC's sales through|\nit need not address HTC's arguments regarding rectification. (See, e.g., D.I. 525 at 4-6)\nThe remaining dispute involves which of HTC's products were authorized. Plaintiffs\nargue that even if Section 2.5 did authorize HTC's sales, the provision only applies to \"HTC\nProducts,\" which the 2009 Agreement defines (See D.I. 571 at\n22-23) Plaintiffs assert that HTC has failed to prove that its products compliant with LTE\nReleases 8 and 9, WiMAX 802.16e, or UMB (\"LTE products\") were not 4G. (See id. at 25)\nHTC, however, argues that the evidence available to the parties at the time they entered into the\nAgreement - the relevant date under applicable U.K. law - shows that the LTE products were\n3.9G products, not 4G products, in 2009. (D.I. 525 at 6-8) As summarized in one of HTC's\n17expert's reports, this evidence includes a 2008 report by Japan's Telecommunications Council\nand journal articles published in 2009. (D.I. 526 Ex. AF Iff 36-41,45)\nPlaintiffs assert a contrary theory based, in part, on their own experts' opinions. For\nexample, they cite Daniel Lindsay's opinion that the patent-licensing industry understood LTE to\nbe 4G \"in and aroimd the 2009 time period.\" (D.I. 571 at 24-25) (citing D.I. 572 Ex. 8825)\nFurther, another of their experts cites evidence in his report showing that the telecommunications\nindustry \"has understood '4G' to include LTE since at least the release of Release 8 in 2008.\"\n{Id. at 24) (citing D.L 572 Ex. 831[ 16)\nThe Court concludes that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether HTC's\nLTE products were considered 4G at the time the parties entered into the 2009 Agreement. The\nCourt agrees with Plaintiffs that the existence of testimony from \"dueling qualified experts\"\nprecludes summary judgment for HTC on this issue. {See id.) (citing Uniloc USA, Inc. v.\nMicrosoft Corp., 632 F.3d 1292,1306 (Fed. Cir. 2011))\nIn sum, the Court grants HTC's motion as to the accused products, with the exception of\nthe LTE products. The Court concludes that HTC's authorized sales of such products (other than\nthe LTE products) exhausted KPN's patent rights to those products. See TransCore, 563 F.3d at\n1274 ('\"The longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale\nof a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.'\") (quoting Quanta Comput, Inc. v.\nLG Elecs., Inc., 553 U.S. 617, 625 (2008)). Trial will be necessary to determine whether the\naccused LTE products were within the scope of the products HTC was authorized to sell without\nhaving to pay BCPN.\nPlaintiffs' MSJ (D.L 517) That \"Comatlas CAS 5093\" Is Not Prior Art\nPlaintiffs argue that Defendant cannot show, under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), that any\nuse, sale, or offer for sale of the Comatlas CAS 5093 occurred in the United States before June\n1826,1995, the '662 patent's effective filing date and one year prior to the date the original United\nStates application was filed. (D.I. 518 at 4-6) Defendant's expert points to a datasheet showing\nthat the Comatlas CAS 5093 was available to order in September 1994 in the United States. (See\nD.I. 575 at 1) (citing D.I. 521 Ex. 4) The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that this datasheet does not\nestablish use or sale of the product. (See D.I. 518 at 5-6) It likewise fails to constitute evidence\nfrom which a reasonable factfinder could find there was an offer for sale, as it does not \"reveal\nthe requisite intent to be bound.\" Linear Tech. Corp. v. Micrel, Inc., 275 F.3d 1040,1051-52\n(Fed. Cir. 2001) (communications must rise \"to the level of an offer for sale that would form a\ncontract if accepted\"). Thus, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion as it pertains to \u00a7 102(b).\nDefendant notes that it identified the Comatlas CAS 5093 as \u00a7 102Cq) prior art as well.\n(See D.I. 575 Ex. 1 at 1) Although Plaintiffs are correct that Defendant's expert. Dr. Jeffay,\nfocuses on \u00a7 102(b) in his report (see Tr. at 149) (referring to D.I. 575 Ex. 7), Defendant has not\n\"abandoned\" its \u00a7 102(a) argument (see Tr. at 153). Notably, Dr. Jeffay's report states that the\nComatlas CAS 5093 \"is prior art under atleasC \u00a7 102(b). (D.I. 575 Ex. 7 ^ 187) (emphasis\nadded) The Court agrees with Defendant that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to\nwhether the Comatlas CAS 5093 was publicly known or used under \u00a7 102(a) at the pertinent\ntime. Defendant, for example, points to a textbook stating that the Comatlas CAS 5093 was\nmarketed as early as September 1993 (see D.I. 575 Ex. 2 at 9866) and an article publicly\navailable in August 1994 referring to the Comatlas CAS 5093 data sheet (id. Ex. 3 at 71208).\nThus, to the extent Plaintiffs move for summary judgment that the Comatlas CAS 5093 is not\nprior art imder \u00a7 102(a), that motion is denied.\nPlaintiffs' MSJ (D.1.517) That \"DigiCipher\" Is Not Prior Art\nPlaintiffs argue that Defendant cannot show, under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), that any\nuse, sale, or offer for sale of the DigiCipher occurred in the United States before June 26,1995.\n19(D.L 518 at 6-7) Defendant offers as evidence promotional materials revealing, in psoit, future\nplans for the product. (See D.I. 521 Ex. 6 at 63235) (noting that particular version of DigiCipher\n\"will begin field testing in spring 1992 and begin production in summer 1992\") Alone, this\nwould likely be insufficient. See Linear Tech., 275 F.3d at 1050. However, the materials also\ncite a March 1992 presentation listing nine live demonstrations of the DigiCipher product in\nvarious cities between January 1991 and February 1992. (D.I. 521 Ex. 6 at 63246) In\ncombination, and taken in the light most favorable to Defendant as the non-moving party, this\nevidence raises a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the DigiCipher was in public use\nduring the relevant time period. See Netscape Commc'ns Corp. v. Konrad, 295 F.3d 1315,1321-\n22 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Thus, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion.\nPlaintiffs' MSJ (D.1.517) That \"CD-3000\" Is Not Prior Art\nPlaintiffs argue that Defendant has failed to show Qualcomm's CD-3000 products were\nin public use as configured to meet \"each of the limitations\" of the asserted claims. Juicy Whip,\nInc. V. Orange Bang, Inc., 292 F.3d 728, 737 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing \u00a7 102(b)). Plaintiffs note\nthat Dr. Jeffay's opinion is not based on an examination of the devices themselves, but on an\nunderstanding more generally of Qualcomm's CDMA technology and^H^|^^^|, which\nJeffay asserts (See\n8-10; see also, e.g., D.I. 521 Ex. 5 f 476 ('j\n\")) Dr. Jeffay further contends that \"Qualcomm had\ndeveloped CDMA technology in the early 1990s that used convolutional encoding and\ninterleaving\" as required by the claims. (D.I. 521 Ex. 7 Tf 202)\nThe Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiffs' motion raises significant questions about\n\"the credibility of Dr. Jeffay's opinions and the technical documents he relies upon.\" (D.I. 575\nat 4) Furthermore, Defendant is asserting the Qualcomm products under \u00a7 103 as well as \u00a7 102.\n20Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant as the non-moving party, the Court\nbelieves there is sufficient basis from which a reasonable factfmder could fmd that the CD-3000\nis prior art. Defendant will be permitted to present evidence and argument that it would have\nbeen obvious to configure the Qualcomm products to operate in the maimer claimed in the\npatent-in-suit. Accordingly, the Court denies this motion.\nPlaintiffs' MSJ (D.L 517) That \"CD-7000\" Is Not Prior Art\nPlaintiffs' argument with respect to the CD-7000 is the same as that the Court just\nconsidered in connection with the CD-3000. Accordingly, and for the same reasons given above,\nthe Court denies Plaintiffs' motion.\nPlaintiffs' MSJ (D.L 517) That \"MacBLAST\" Is Not Prior Art\nWhether the MacBLAST product is prior art turns on questions relating to Dr. Jeffay's\ncredibility and the technical documents he relies upon. As with the discussion above in\nconnection with Plaintiffs' motion directed to the CD-3000, Defendant is also asserting the\nMacBLAST under \u00a7 103 as well as \u00a7 102. As with the CD-3000 motion. Plaintiffs' MacBLAST\nmotion is also denied.\nDefendant's MSJ (D.L 529) Of No Pre-Snit Damages Under \u00a7 287\nDefendant moves for summary judgment of no pre-suit damages on the grounds that\nPlaintiffs did not comply with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 as they did not address patent marking in their\ncomplaints. (D.!. 530 at 5-6) Under \u00a7 287, a patent owner who fails to mark its products, or\nfails to require its licensees to mark their products, cannot recover damages arising from\ninfringement occurring before the date that the alleged infringer receives actual notice of the\nalleged infringement. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. In challenging Plaintiffs' compliance with \u00a7 287, the\ninitial burden is on Defendant \"to articulate the products it believes are unmarked 'patented\narticles' subject to \u00a7 287.\" Arctic Cat, 876 F.3d at 1368. \"The alleged infringer need only put\n21the patentee on notice that he or his authorized licensees sold specific unmarked products which\nthe alleged infnnger believes practice the patent.\" Lubby Holdings LLC v. Chung, 11 F.4th\n1355,1359 (Fed. Cir. 2021). This burden is \"a burden of production, not one of persuasion or\nproof.\" Id. At that point, the burden shifts to Plaintiffs \"to prove the products identified do not\npractice the patented invention.\" Id.\nOn April 30, 2020, five months before the close of fact discovery, HTC identified several\nproducts it contends were licensed, would infringe under Plaintiffs' theory, and were not marked\nbefore the start of the alleged damages period on January 30,2011. (^See, e.g., D.I. 533 Ex. 7 at\n37-38,44; id. Ex. 8 at 34-41; id. Ex. 9 771-82) While the list is lengthy. Plaintiffs note\ncorrectly that Defendant limited its summary judgment motion solely to||[^^| products. (Tr.\nat 138) Accordingly, the Court limits its analysis at this stage to these products.\nDefendant points to which sold no later than\nand which uses the same chipsets as some of HTC's accused products. (See D.I.\n533 Ex. 7 at 37-38,44; id. Ex. 9 ITf 789-94) The record reveals that!\n(Id. Ex. 12) KPN's representative, Koenraad Wuyts, confirmed I\n(See id. Ex. 20 at 254,263-64)\nThe parties clarified at the hearing, however, that]\na fact that was not otherwise\nclear from the existing record. (See Tr. at 129-30,134) |\n(emphasis added) Defendant asserts that\nMotorola Mobility\n(See D.I. 533 12 2.1) I^efendant also\n22noted, for the first time at the hearing, that in a related case. Motorola Mobility claimed to have a\nlicense to the '662 patent (See C.A. No. 17-84 D.L 25 f 2) (\"Motorola [Mobility] admits that\n... U.S. Patent No[]. 6,212,662 ... ha[s] been licensed to [it].\")\nThese arguments, however, do not persuade the Court that summary judgment is\nappropriate. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as the non-movant, a\nreasonable factfinder could find that I\nwere not licensed. On the present record, there appear to be genuine disputes of material fact as\nto the relationship between!\n(D.I. 572 Ex. 49 at 13-14) In addition, while the record establishes that\nhad a license to the '662 patent, the Court cannot discern from the record which\nlicensed products were sold by mm|| and which purportedly licensed products were sold\nby and during which times. These matters present additional genuine\ndisputes of material fact. Further, while HTC now asks the Court to take judicial notice of\nMotorola Mobility's claim in the related case to having a license from BCPN (see Tr. at 141),\nHTC failed to provide Plaintiffs timely notice of its intent to rely on the documents from the\nrelated case (see id. at 143), and Plaintiffs have not had a fair opportunity to respond to this\nargument. This is another reason summary judgment is not appropriate. (See id. at 146)\nIn the alternative, HTC moves for summary judgment on the ground that it did not\nreceive actual notice before KPN filed its complaint. (D.I. 530 at 13-14) Section 287(a)\nprovides that when a patentee or patent licensee makes or sells a product practicing the patent,\nthe patentee can only recover damages from one who infringes the patent if: (1) the patentee or\nlicensee has marked its product in the manner specified in the statute (i.e., the infnnger has\n\"constructive notice of infringement\"), or (2) the patentee actually notifies the infringer of its\n23infringement. In the case of such \"actual notice,\" a patentee may only recover damages for\ninfringement occurring after notice was given. The actual notice requirement may be satisfied\n\"when the recipient is informed of the identity of the patent and the activity that is believed to be\nan infringement, accompanied by a proposal to abate the infringement, whether by license or\notherwise.\" Lubby, 11 F.4th at 1360. When considering actual notice under \u00a7 287, courts \"must\nfocus on the action of the patentee, not the knowledge or understanding of the infringer.\" Id.\nTaking all the\nevidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs as the non-moving party, a reasonable factfinder\ncould find that KPN provided HTC actual notice as of at least Accordingly,\nthe Court denies HTC's motion with respect to lack of actual notice.\nDefendant's MSJ (D.L 529) On KPN's\nAbandoned Claims And Affirmative Defenses\nDefendant's motion is directed primarily to claims brought by Plaintiffs against LGE and\naffirmative defenses raised by Plaintiffs in response to LGE's counterclaims. (See D.I. 530 at\n14) Since the claims and counterclaims in Plaintiffs' action against LGE have been dismissed\n24with prejudice, that aspect of Defendant's motion is no longer relevant. As to HTC, Plaintiffs\nconfirm they are no longer pursuing \"claims against HTC under Count 1 of the Third Amended\nComplaint that HTC indirectly infringes the '662 Patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 271(b) & (c).\" (Id.)\nPlaintiffs do not oppose the Court granting summary judgment on those claims. (See D.I. 571 at\n17) The Court will do so.\nPlaintiffs' MSJ (D.1.517) On HTC's Waiver Defense^\nHTC does not oppose the Court granting summary judgment on its waiver defense. (See\nD.I. 605) (explaining that \"[i]n view of the Court's order denying HTC's request to reopen\ndiscovery to pursue discovery of the '662 patent inventors\" (D.I. 602), HTC is no longer\npursuing its waiver defense) The Court will do so.\nPlaintiffs' MSJ (D.I. 517) On Defendant's Abandoned Defenses\nHTC does not oppose the Court granting summary judgment on the abandoned\naffirmative defenses it is no longer pursuing with respect to the '662 patent.'\u00ae (See D.I. 518 at 3-\n4; D.I. 581 at 1) The Court will do so.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1. Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment (D.I. 517) is GRANTED IN PART and\nDENIED IN PART.\n2. Plaintiffs' motion to exclude in part the expert reports of Kevin Jeffay and Timothy S.\n^ Plaintiffs also challenged several affirmative defenses asserted by LGE only, including\nequitable estoppel, judicial estoppel, collateral estoppel, and license and/or patent exhaustion.\n(See D.I. 518 at 23-27) In light of the parties' settlement in C.A. No. 17-85, these issues are no\nlonger pending before the Court.\nThese include judicial estoppel, res judicata and/or collateral estoppel, laches and/or equitable\nestoppel, government sales, failure to state a claim, lack of standing, and misuse.
