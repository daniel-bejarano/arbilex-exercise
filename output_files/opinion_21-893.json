{"case_name": "Elemica Inc. v. ecMarket Inc.", "case_number": "21-893", "judge": "Judge Stephanos Bibas", "date": "03-29-2022", "ocr_text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nELEMICA INC . \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n ECMARKET INC.,\n d/b/a Conexiom Inc.  \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:21-cv-00893-SB \n \n \nJohn David Simmons, P ANITCH SCHWARZE  BELISARIO & NADEL LLP,  Wilmington, \nDelaware . \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff.  \n Steven L. Caponi, Megan E. O\u2019Connor, K&L\n GATES LLP, Wilmington, Delaware; \nJohn Ambrogi, Richard Saldinger, L ATIMER LEVAY FYOCK  LLC,  Chicago, Illinois . \n \nCounsel for Defendant.  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \nMarch 29, 2022  \n \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nAs parties uncover new information, they develop a better sense of the issues. And \nif they spot potential new claims, they may amend their pleadings. That is what hap-\npened here. One vendor sued another and later discovered incriminating emails. So \nit moved to amend its complaint, tacking on new claims.  So it moved to amend. Be-\ncause some of its claims are plausible and amendment will not prejudice ecMarket, \nElemica may amend.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nElemica automates supply -chain links to suppliers, shippers, and customers. \nCompl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  7. Its automation technology uses ecMarket \u2019s services to format data . \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 14\u201315. To use those services, Elemica had to give ecMarket  a lot of information \nabout its customers and their businesses.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 25. Seeking to protect that data, \nElemica  convinced ecMarket to sign a confidentiality agreement limiting its use to \ntheir \u201c[b]usiness [r]elationship.\u201d D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 2(iii); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  8\u201325. \nThat relationship worked well for a while. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 17\u201324. Then, Elemica learned \nthat ecMarket was trying  to use  that data to poach some of its  clients.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 25\u201327. \nAfter that, the relationship collapsed. D.I. 19 -1. Elemica developed its own data -for-\nmatting service to replace ecMarket\u2019s. Proposed Am. Compl., D.I. 18 -1 \u00b6 35. And it \nsued ecMarket for breaching their  contract and violating trade -secrets laws . Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 28\u201338. \nAt once , ecMarket moved to dismiss. D.I. 7. But before I could rule on that motion, \nElemica asked to amend its complaint. D.I. 18. Apparently, it has  gotten  two emails \nfrom ecMarket to Elemica\u2019s  customers inviting them to \u201cstart [a] relationship directly 3 with [ecMarket].\u201d D.I. 19 -1; see also D.I. 19 -2. It says t hese emails \u201cbolster []\u201d its con-\ntract and trade -secrets claims. D.I. 19 , at 3. Plus, they support two new claims for \ndeceptive trade practi ces and injurious falsehood. Id. , at 3\u2013 4. \nI agree in part. Elemica\u2019s proposed amendments do not support claims for breach \nof contract or injurious falsehood. But its trade -secrets and deceptive -trade -practices \nclaims are plausible. So I will let  Elemica up date its complaint.  \nII. ELEMICA MAY AMEND ITS COMPLAINT  \nI should  let parties  amend \u201cfreely \u2026 when justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a). But my discretion is bounded: I should not allow amendment  if it is unduly \ndelayed, offered in bad faith, prejudicial to the defendant, or futile.  Burtch v. Milberg \nFactors, Inc. , 662 F.3d 212, 230 \u201331 (3d Cir. 2011).  None of those negative factors is  \npresent here.  \nElemica wasted no time in asking to amend after discovering ecMarket\u2019s emails: \nit filed its motion just a week after the emails were sent. D.I. 18, 19- 1, 19 -2. At that \npoint, ecMarket had not yet filed an answer. Nor had the parties agreed on a briefing \nschedule. D.I. 19 , at 3. S o Elemica did not unduly delay amend ing. See White Winston \nSelect Asset F unds, LLC v. Good Times Rest s., Inc. , 2021 WL 4948044, at *2 (D. Del. \nOct. 25, 2021).  \nNor would amendment  prejudice ecMarket. At most, ecMarket suggests that I \ncould save everyone time by ruling on its motion to dismiss first. D.I. 20, at 8 \u20139; D.I. \n28, at 7. On the contrary, granting leave to amend is  more efficient. Suppose I dis-\nmissed Elemica\u2019s original complaint  first.  I could  then grant leave to amend , and \necMarket could again move to dismiss . Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), 12(b)(6).  Thus, I would 4 need to consider twice whether Elemica stated a claim.  White Winston, 2021 WL \n4948044, at *2 (citing Shane v. Fauver, 213 F.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir. 2000)). Deciding \nthis motion saves both the time it would take Elemica to refile and the time needed to resolve some issues potentially raised by a renewed motion to dismiss.  \nAnd some of Elemica\u2019s claims could  survive a motion to dismiss:  \n1. Trade s ecrets. Elemica plausibly claims that ecMarket ab used its \u201ctrade se-\ncret[s].\u201d Oakwood Laby\u2019s LLC v. Thanoo , 999 F.3d 892, 905 (3d Cir. 2021) (explaining \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7  1839). It says ecMarket used confidential information about its \u201c custom-\ners\u2019 \u201cneeds and requirements, data, software, pricing, and \u2026 business systems\u201d to \ndraft pitches stealing Elemica\u2019s business. Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6 \u00b6 26, 29 \u201336; D.I. 19 -\n1, 19- 2; see also Revzip, LLC v. McDonnell , 2020 WL 1929523, at *3, 8 (W.D. Pa. Apr. \n21, 2020)  (customer information can be a trade secret).   \nAnd ecMarket knew that it could not use Elemica\u2019s customer information that \nway. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7  1839(5)(B)(ii)(II). It had signed a confidentiality agreement promis-\ning to use customer information only in its partnership with Elemica. Proposed Am. \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6  8\u201326; D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 2(iii) ; see Oakwood , 999 F.3d at 912. So Elemica plausibly \naccuses ecMarket of  misusing its trade secrets.  \n2. Deceptive t rade practices. Elemica also plausibly alleges that ecMarket engaged \nin deceptive trade practices. Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  48\u201358. Delaware law classifies \nas deceptive statements that a defendant\u2019s  \u201cservices have  \u2026 characteristics  \u2026 that \nthey do not have\u201d or those that falsely \u201c[d]isparage [] the \u2026 services  \u2026 of another.\u201d \nDel. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 2533, 2532(a)(5), (8), (12).  5 Elemica says ecMarket misrepresented  Elemica\u2019 s services and falsely portra yed \necMarket\u2019s own. In its emails, ecMarket suggested its services were the exact same \nas Elemica\u2019s. D.I. 19 -1; Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  31, 35.  In reality, ecMarket\u2019s data -\nformatting services make up only \u201ca small portion of the overall service provided by \nElemica [].\u201d Id. \u00b6 31.  \nPlus, ecMarket implied that Elemica\u2019s customers would suffer \u201cdisruption[s] in \nservice\u201d when its partnership with ecMarket ended. D.I. 19 -1. To the contrary, \nElemica\u2019s  services would remain fully \u201coperational\u201d because Elemica is develop ing its \nown replacement for ecMarket\u2019s formatting service. Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6  35. That \nis enough to plausibly state a deceptive -trade claim. Del.  Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7  2532(b).  \nResisting  this conclusion, ecMarket argues that its business agreements with \nElemica echo the claims in its emails. D.I. 28, at 2\u2013 3. Those agreements described \necMarket\u2019s services as essential. Since they did, argues ecMarket , its comments  could \nnot be disparaging.  Id.  \nBut I may look at those agreements only if they are \u201cintegral to\u201d Elemica\u2019s claims. \nIn re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. , 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997)  (quoting \nShaw v. Digital Equip. Corp. , 82 F.3d 1194, 1220 (1st Cir. 1996) ) (emphasis omitted). \nThese agreements are not. Though they leave in place the confidentiality agreement \nunderlying some of Elemica\u2019s claims, they do not appear to change  it at all . Proposed \nAm. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  17, 25. Plus, the confidentiality agreement \u2019s obligat ions might con-\ntinue even after the parties\u2019 relationship ends : ecMarket may not use customer infor-\nmation for five years after receiving it . D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20134. Put differently, Elemica\u2019s 6 claim s would look the same even if those agreements did not exist. So I will not look \nat them yet, and ecMarket can raise them in its defense at a later stage.  \n3. Injurious falsehood . But Elemica does not plausibly state an injurious -falsehood \nclaim. Proposed Am. Compl.  \u00b6\u00b6 59\u201364. To do so, it needed to  connect a \u201cfalse state-\nment\u201d by ecMarket to \u201ca third person\u2019s reliance and harm to [Elemica\u2019s] interests.\u201d \nIn re Nat\u2019l Collegiate Student Loan Tr . Litig. , 2020 WL 3960334, at *6 (Del. Ch. July \n13, 2020)  (emphasis add ed); accord Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7  623A cmt. b, 632 \ncmt. b  (Am. L. Inst. 1977).  \nYet Elemica falters on harm. It hints that ecMarket\u2019s solicitation emails might \nlead to lost business. Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6  41. But Elemica does not say that it \nactually lost business.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 632 cmt. b . (limiting lia-\nbility to statements that do, in fact, divert business).  So it does not plead a plausible \ninjurious falsehood claim.  \n4. Breach of c ontract. Elemica\u2019s breach -of-contract claim fails for th e same reason. \nTo show a breach of a confidentiality agreement, it must point to a \u201ccompensable \ninjury.\u201d Kronenberg v. Katz , 872 A.2d 568, 606 (Del. Ch. 2004). But it does not . It has \nnot identified lost business. And though it hints that it may  have to ta ke \u201ccorrective \nefforts\u201d to mitigate damage from ecMarket\u2019s improper use, it does not explain \nwhether it has  done so . Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6  41. So that claim is not plausible ei-\nther.  7 * * * * * \nBecause two of Elemica\u2019s  claims are plausible, amendment is not futile. Plus,  that \namendment is timely and will not prejudice ecMarket. So I grant Elemica\u2019s motion in \npart and deny  ecMarket\u2019s earlier motion to dismiss as moot .  \n  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nELEMICA INC.  \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n ECMARKET INC.,\n d/b/a Conexiom Inc.  \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:21-cv-00893-SB \n \nORDER  \n1. I GRANT  the motion to amend  [D.I. 18] as to Counts II and III.  The motion is \nDENIED as to Counts I and IV . I DENY  Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss [D.I. \n7] as moot.  \n \n2. I ORDER the parties  to confer and submit a proposed scheduling order by \nTuesday, April 12,  2022.  The scheduling order must follow this template: \nhttps://www.ded.uscourts.gov/sites/ded/files/Scheduling%20Order.pdf.  \n  \nDated: March 29 , 2022                     ____________________________________ \n                UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE  \n"}
