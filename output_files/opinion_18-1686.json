Watts, WILSON SONSINI GOODRICH & ROSATI , P.C, Seattle, \nWashington . Counsel for Defendants. \nNovember ~, 2021 \nWilmington , DE AND \nThis is a consolidated shareholder derivative action in which Plaintiffs primarily alleged \nthat the Individual Defendants , who are officers and directors of Impinj, Inc. (\"Impinj\" or the \n\"Company\"), breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the Company to issue false and \nmisleading statements in violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \n\"Exchange Act\"). Plaintiffs also asserted claims for unjust enrichment based on alleged insider \ntrading. The Individual Defendants are Chris Diorio, Eric Brodersen , Evan Fein, Gregory Sessler, \nTom A. Alberg, Clinton Bybee, Peter van Oppen, and Theresa Wise. Impinj is named as a Nominal \nDefendant. After very little litigation , the parties have agreed to a settlement. Pending before the \nCourt is Plaintiffs ' motion for final approval of the settlement and Plaintiffs' request for attorneys ' \nfees and service awards. (D.I. 33). For the following reasons, the Court will approve the \nsettlement , and award $439,745.12 in attorneys ' fees and expenses and $1,500 in service awards. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. The Claims \nImpinj provides a platform comprising of integrated circuit tags (\"I Cs\") and software that \ndelivers item data to business applications. (D.I. 1 ,r,r 2,3). Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants \nwillfully or recklessly failed to maintain internal controls at the Company and misrepresented \nand/or caused the Company to misrepresent Impinj's business, operations, and prospects in press \nreleases, earnings calls, and filings with the SEC. (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 I, A). Specifically , Plaintiffs alleged \nthat between November 3, 2016 and August 2, 2018 the Defendants caused Impinj to falsely tout \nin its public filings strong demand for its endpoint I Cs, which artificially inflated the value of the \nCompany's stock. (D.I. 1 ,r,r 4, 81-126). Plaintiffs further alleged that certain Defendants unjustly \nenriched themselves by selling Company stock while knowing that its price was artificially \ninflated. (Id. at ,r,r 90, 188-191). Finally, in August 2018, the Company revealed that its earnings \n1 release would be delayed and that it received a complaint from a former employee that prompted \nan Audit Committee investigation. (Id. at ,r,r 5-7). \nB. The Litigation \nPlaintiffs Fotouhi and Weiss filed their individual complaints on October 26, 2018 and \nOctober 28, 2018, respectively. (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 I, B). Plaintiffs de la Fuente and Sanchez filed their \ncomplaint on November 8, 2018.1 (Id.). On January 2, 2019, the Court granted the Parties' joint \nstipulation to consolidate the three actions and establish a leadership structure. (D.I. 7; D.I. 8). \nOn January 25, 2019, the Parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the Derivative Action in \ndeference to the related securities class action, In re Impinj, Inc. Securities Litigation , Case No. \n3:18-cv-05704, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (the \n\"Securities Class Action\"). The Court granted the stay on January 28, 2019. (D.I. 10). \nC. The Settlement \nOn May 19, 2020, Plaintiffs sent Defendants a settlement proposal that included thirteen \ncategories of corporate governance reforms and a demand for $10 million to be paid to the \nCompany. (D.I. 34 at 5). Plaintiffs described their proposal as \"essentiall y a wish list of every \nconceivable form of relief that might get whittled down through negotiation .\" (Id. at 5). Plaintiffs \ncrafted the settlement proposal by relying entirely on public information. (Tr. 7:20-8:4).2 On May \n27, 2020, Defendants responded with a counterproposal. (D.I. 13-1 at 3). On May 28, 2020, the \nParties participated in a mediation facilitated by a qualified and independent mediator. (Id.). \nNegotiations continued until June 5, 2020 when the parties agreed to settle the action for certain \ncorporate governance reforms. (Id.; D.I. 34 at 10). \nBecause no consolidated complaint was filed, the Court relies on the individual complaint \nin the consolidated action, C.A. No. 18-1686 as representati ve (hereinafter , the \"Complaint \"). \n2 Cites to \"Tr.\" refer to the transcript from the oral argument on Plaintiffs ' Motion for Final \nApproval of the Settlement held on May 11, 2021. \n2 To resolve the outstanding demand for a monetary contribution , on June 6, 2020, \nDefendants produced copies of the Audit Committee 's presentation to the SEC regarding its \ninvestigation ; the SEC's letter terminating its investigation without an enforcement \nrecommendation ; and the letter from the former employee withdrawing his OSHA complaint with \nprejudice. (D.I. 34 at 10). After reviewing these documents , which \"revealed a material weakness \nin the case,\" Plaintiffs dropped their demand for a monetary contribution. (Id. at 11 ). \nOn June 8, 2020, the Parties agreed to a double-blind Mediator 's proposal on the amount \nof attorneys ' fees and reimbursement of expenses to be paid to Plaintiffs' Counsel. (D.I. 35 ,r 38). \nOn June 10, 2020, after the parties had agreed to the settlement terms and the fee request, \nDefendants produced to Plaintiffs 902 pages of confirmatory discovery primarily consisting of \nboard meeting minutes, committee meeting minutes, and financial records relevant to the \nallegations in the Complaint. (Id. at ,r 39; D.I. 31 at 6). On July 11, 2020, the Parties filed a Joint \nMotion for Preliminary Approval of the Derivative Settlement , which the Court granted on \nFebruary 26, 2021 after requesting and receiving supplemental submissions. (D.I. 13; D.I. 14; D.I. \n23; D.I. 25; D.I. 26). \nII. DISCUSSION \nThe first issue before the Court is whether to approve the settlement. If the settlement is \napproved , then the Court must determine whether to award attorneys ' fees and, if so, how much. \nFinally, the Court will address Plaintiffs ' request for service awards. \nA. Approval of the Settlement \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1, a court's approval is required to settle a \nderivative action. To grant approval, a court must find that the settlement is \"fair, adequate, \nreasonable and proper, and in the best interests of the class and the shareholders .\" Bell At!. Corp. \nv. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1310, 1317 (3d Cir. 1993). In making this determination , the Court must consider \n3 the Girsh factors, which are: (1) the complexity , expense and likely duration of the litigation ; (2) \nthe reaction of the shareholders to the settlement ; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount \nof discovery completed; ( 4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; \n(6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to \nwithstand a greater judgment ; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement agreement in light \nof the best possible recovery; and (9) the range ofreasonableness of the settlement agreement to a \npossible recovery in light of all the attendant risks oflitigation. See Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, \n157 (3d Cir.1975); Shlensky v. Dorsey, 574 F.2d 131, 148 (3d Cir. 1978) (stating that the Girsh \nfactors apply to a shareholder derivative action). \"The proponents of a settlement bear the burden \nof proving that these factors weigh in favor of approval. \" In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d \n201,232 (3d Cir. 2001). The Court has \"wide discretion \" in determining whether to grant or deny \napproval of a settlement. Shlensky, 574 F.2d at 147. Each Girsh factor is addressed in turn below. \n1. First Factor: Complexity, Expense and Likely Duration of Litigation. \nThe first factor considers the \"probable costs, in both time and money of continued \nlitigation .\" In re Gen. Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, \n814 (3d Cir. 1995). Shareholder derivative actions are, by their nature, \"undeniably complex.\" \nUnite Nat. Retirement Fund v. Watts, 2005 WL 2877899 at *3 (D.N.J. Oct. 28, 2005). They can \nalso be expensive. Defense counsel estimates that briefing and arguing a motion to dismiss could \ncost up to $500,000 dollars. (Tr. 5:17-23). This seems like a bargain compared to the $900,000 \nfee request by Plaintiffs' Counsel, but only if the motion to dismiss is guaranteed to end the case. \nThe cost of litigating this case past a motion to dismiss, which would require the parties to engage \nin the formal discovery they have so far avoided, could quickly dwarf the cost of the fee request, \nparticularly because this case involves multiple individual Defendants and claims based on a lack \nof oversight. For the foregoing reasons, this factor favors settlement. \n4 2. Second Factor: Reaction of Shareholders. \nAs a general rule, a small number of objectors weighs in favor of approval. In re Johnson \n& Johnson Derivative Litig., 900 F. Supp. 2d 467, 482 (D.N.J. 2012). But in the context of \ncomplex derivative actions, courts should be cautious before placing great weight on this factor, \nbecause the typical investor may not possess the tools with which to value settlement relief \ncomprised entirely of corporate governance reforms. Id. Here, no objections to the settlement \nhave been made by any Impinj stockholders. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of the \nsettlement but perhaps not strongly. \n3. Third Factor: Stage of Proceedings & Amount of Discovery Completed. \nThis factor considers \"the degree of case development \" achieved before settlement \nnegotiations to determine \"whether class counsel had an adequate appreciation of the merits of the \ncase\" before reaching an agreement. GM Trucks, 55 F.3d at 813. \"Even settlements reached at a \nvery early stage and prior to formal discovery are appropriate where there is no evidence of \ncollusion and the settlement represents substantial concessions by both parties.\" In re Johnson, \n900 F. Supp. 2d at 482. \nThis action has settled at the earliest possible stage. The only activity on the docket before \nthe parties sought approval of the settlement is the filing of the individual complaints , \nconsolidation, and entry of a stipulated stay. (D.I. 8; D.I. 10; D.I. 13). Plaintiffs ' Counsel did not \nfile a books and record demand pursuant to 8 Del. C. \u00a7 220 and no discovery took place before the \nparties agreed to the settlement terms. (Tr. 7:20-8:4, 23:4-14). Plaintiffs ' Counsel did engage in \nconfirmatory discovery , but this practice has been criticized. \n'\"Confirmatory' discovery is discovery taken after an agreement-in -principle to settle a \ncase has been reached.\" In re Trulia, Inc. S'holder Litig., 129 A.3d 884, 893 n. 24 (Del. Ch. 2016). \n\"Theoretically, it is an opportunity for plaintiffs' counsel to 'confirm' that the settlement terms are \n5 reasonable-that is, to probe further the strengths and weaknesses of the claims relative to the \nconsideration for the proposed settlement. \" Id. \"In reality, given that plaintiffs ' counsel already \nhave resigned themselves to settle on certain terms, confirmatory discovery rarely leads to a \nrenunciation of the proposed settlement and, instead, engenders activity more reflective of 'going \nthrough the motions.'\" Id. \nAccordingly , the information on which Plaintiffs ' Counsel relied to negotiate the \nsettlement terms does not reflect best practices. At the same time, however, there is no evidence \nof collusion. The parties relied on an experienced mediator as part of the settlement negotiations. \nSee D.I. 35-2 (declaration of mediator). The settlement represented substantial concessions by \nboth parties. (See D.I. 35-2 ,r,r 12-13; D.I. 34 at 5-10). And the fee agreement was negotiated \nseparately after the parties reached agreement on the reforms. (D.I. 35-2 ,r 14). Thus, this factor \nfavors approval of the settlement. \n4. Fourth and Fifth Factors: Risks of Establishing Liability and Damages. \nThe fourth and fifth factors examine the potential risks and rewards of litigating the action \n\"rather than settling it at the current time.\" GM Trucks, 55 F.3d at 814-16; In re Warfarin Sodium \nAntitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 537 (3d Cir. 2004). These factors weigh strongly in favor of \napproval when a plaintiff faces \"significant obstacles \" in establishing liability. In re Cendant, 264 \nF.3d at 237-38. \nHere, Plaintiffs faced numerous obstacles in establishing liability and damages. There is a \nreal risk that the derivative action would not have survived a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule \n23.1, which imposes a heightened pleading standard. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1 (stating that \nplaintiffs must plead demand futility \"with particularity \"). \nTo overcome Rule 23 .1, Plaintiffs needed to establish that a majority of the directors on \nthe Board were not sufficiently disinterested to consider a demand. Malone v. Brincat, 722 A.2d \n6 5, 14 (Del. 1998). Here, all the members of the Board except one were independent non\u00ad\nmanagement directors. Thus, Plaintiffs alleged that the majority of the board was interested, for \ndemand futility purposes, because the directors faced a substantial likelihood of liability. (D.I. 34 \nat 19). The claims, however, largely center on alleged failures to conduct proper oversight, the \nmost difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment. See \nIn re Caremark Int'! Inc. Derivative Litig., 698 A.2d 959,967 (Del. Ch. 1996). \nThe material weaknesses in Plaintiffs' case is further demonstrated by the termination of \nthe SEC investigation , the whistleblower 's withdrawal of his complaint , and the Audit \nCommittee's investigations conducted with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel, \nforensic experts, and outside auditors that found no wrongdoing. (D.I. 34 at 20; D.I. 31 at 5). \nAccordingly, this factor favors settlement. \n5. Sixth Factor: Risk of Maintaining the Class Action Through Trial. \nThe sixth factor considers the risk of maintaining class status, because \"the value of a class \naction depends largely on the certification of the class. GM Trucks, 55 F.3d at 817. \"A derivative \naction does not present the same concern.\" Unite Nat., 2005 WL 2877899, at *4. Therefore, this \nfactor does not weigh for or against approval. \n6. Seventh Factor: Defendants' Ability to Withstand a Greater Judgment. \nHere, the settlement is based on corporate governance reforms and does not include a \nmonetary component. (D.I.13-1). But Plaintiffs ' Complaint did seek damages. (SeeD.I. 1 Prayer \nfor Relief). In addition, Plaintiffs initially sought a monetary contribution to the settlement. (D.I. \n34 at 5). Because a monetary judgment could have been imposed on the Defendants after a \nsuccessful trial, this factor is not, as Plaintiffs claim, inapplicable to the Court's analysis. \nThe analysis of this factor is complicated by the fact that the Individual Defendants are \nentitled to indemnification from the Company. (See Tr. 41: 15-20; see also 8 Del. C. \u00a7 145). Thus, \n7 Defendants may be able to withstand a greater judgment because they are not playing with their \nown money. At the same time, however, the Company has exhausted all of its available insurance. \n(Tr. 40:13-41:20). And Defendants made a representation in the related Securities Class Action \nthat \"Impinj is not and rarely has been profitable in its history.\" (See Securities Class Action, D.I. \n97 at 7-8). So if this derivative action continues , then the Company that is supposed to benefit will \nbe spending its own money in providing discovery , indemnifying the Individual Defendants , and \nfunding their own obligations as a Nominal Defendant. (Tr. 41:15-20). Accordingly, this factor \nfavors settlement. \n7. Eighth and Ninth Factors: Settlement's Range of Reasonableness in \nLight of the Best Possible Recovery and Litigation Risks \nThe last two factors evaluate whether the settlement represents a \"good value for a weak __ \ncase or a poor value for a strong case.\" In re Warfarin , 391 F.3d at 538. As described above, \nPlaintiffs have real weaknesses in their case. In addition, Plaintiffs estimated that any potential \nmonetary recovery was \"relatively small,\" no more than$ 9.3 million. (D.I. 34 at 21-22). At the \nsame time, shareholder litigation commonl y obtains only a few percent of total damages. See In re \nAT&T Corp., 455 F.3d 160, 170 (3d Cir. 2006) (finding that a settlement representing only 4% of \nthe total damages claimed was an \"excellent\" result). Accordingly , these two factors weigh in \nfavor of approving the settlement. \n8. Weighing all of the Girsh Factors Together \nA few of the Girsh factors are neutral while the vast majority of the Girsh factors favor \napproval of the settlement. No Girsh factor weighs against the settlement. Weighing all of the \nGirsh factors together, the Court finds that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate. Thus, the settlement is approved. I now turn to the matter of attorneys ' fees. \n8 B. Attorneys' Fees \nPlaintiffs request $900,000 in fees and expenses. (D.I. 34 at 25). The number was a \ndouble-blind proposal of an experienced Mediator , which both sides accepted. \nAn attorneys ' fees award is governed by state rules when subject matter jurisdiction is \nbased on diversity .3 Mor ex rel AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Collis, 654 F. App'x 553, 558 (3d \nCir. 2016). Here, jurisdiction is not based on diversity , so federal rules will govern. (See D.I. 1 \n,r,r 15-17). Under the American rule applied in federal courts, a prevailing party is not entitled to \nrecover attorneys ' fees absent statutory authority or common law doctrine. Shlensky , 574 F.2d at \n149. Accordingly , a request for attorneys' fees involves a two-step inquiry: (1) a determination as \nto whether plaintiffs' counsel is entitled to recover attorneys' fees, and (2) if yes, calculating the \namount of attorneys' fees to award based on the appropriate method. \n1. The Substantial Benefit Doctrine \nUnder federal common law, plaintiffs ' counsel in a derivative action may recover their \nexpenses, including attorneys ' fees, if the corporation on whose behalf their action is taken receives \na substantial benefit from their successful prosecution or settlement of the case. Mills v. Electr. \nAuto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375,395 (1970); Shlensky , 574 F.2d at 149. The benefit may be monetary \nor nonmonetary. Shlensky, 574 F.2d at 149. \nPlaintiffs ' counsel contends that the settlement substantially benefits Impinj by requiring \nit to implement corporate governance reforms that are specifically designed to prevent the \nrecurrence of Defendants ' alleged misconduct. (D.I. 34 at 26). The Settlement Agreement groups \nthe reforms into ten sections. Each section is discussed in turn below. \n3 This rule is based on a principle announced by the US Supreme Court that defendants \nshould not be able to avoid unfavorable state law with respect to attorneys' fees by removing the \ncase to federal court. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Pac. Indem. Co., 557 F.2d 51, 56 (3d Cir. 1977) \n(discussing Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240 (1975)). \n9 \u2022 Adoption of Risk-Management Related Amendments to the Audit Committee Charter. \nAs part of the settlement, the Audit Committee will be renamed the Audit and Risk \nCommittee and its Charter will be amended to require specific risk-management \nresponsibilities such as receiving from executive officers' quarterly reports on the \nCompany 's risk management activities , providing written reports to the Board of any \nmaterial risks along with specific recommendations for mitigating those risks, \nproviding annual reports to the Compensation Committee regarding the executive \nofficers contribution to a culture of compliance , and conducting an annual review of \nthe effectiveness of the Company 's risk management policies and practices. (D.I. 13-\n1 \u00a7 1). \nThese reforms are intended to address allegations in the Complaint that the Board failed to \nconduct proper oversight which led to the allegedly false and misleading disclosures _ (D L 31 at \n11 ). Before the settlement , the Audit Committee Charter but did not contain the specific \nresponsibilities identified . But the Charter did identify \"risk management \" as part of the \nCommittee's oversight responsibilities and the Committee did generally perform the specific \nresponsibilities identified , although it was not necessarily the Committee's practice to do so every \nquarter or to do so in writing. (D.I. 31 at 7 nn. 3, 4). Thus, the Court finds these reforms to be \nmodest and incremental. \n\u2022 Amendments to the Audit & Risk Committee Charter. The settlement amends the \nAudit & Risk Committee Charter to (i) require the committee to review the Company 's \nCode of Conduct annually, (ii) solicit the input of department representatives as \nnecessary to review the accuracy of the Company's public disclosures related to issues \nwithin their expertise , (iii) obtain an annual report listing all trades in Impinj securities \nmade by the Company 's executive officers, and (iv) conduct preemptive due diligence \non potential independent auditors to ensure the Company is not without registered \nindependent auditors upon the resignation or termination of its current auditors. (D.I. \n13-1 \u00a7 5). \nThe first two reforms in this section are intended, like the reforms in the section above, to \naddress allegations in the Complaint that the Board failed to conduct proper oversight. (D.I. 31 at \n11 ). The third reform is intended to deter insider trading, another harm alleged in the Complaint. \nThe fourth reform appears to be makeweight , because there were no allegations in the Complaint \nregarding the Company's auditor. Accordingly , the Court will disregard the fourth reform. The \n10 remaining three reforms directly address the harms alleged in the Complaint and provide a \nmeaningful benefit. Before the settlement , the Audit Committee was not required to review the \nCompany's Code of Conduct on an annual basis and did not obtain a report of executive \nmanagement's trades in lmpinj securities on an annual basis. (D.I. 31 at 9). \n\u2022 Expert Advice on Internal Controls and Compliance Functions . As part of the \nsettlement, the Company has agreed to retain an independent consulting service to \nassist it in identifying the appropriate steps it should take to test and strengthen the \nCompany 's internal controls. (D.1. 13-1 \u00a7 3). \nThis reform is intended to address allegations in the Complaint that the Company lacked \ninternal controls. Regardless , I have questions about the value of this reform. Defendants state \nthat before the settlement but after Plaintiffs filed their lawsuit, the Company engaged a consultant \nto review the Company's internal controls for compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (D.I. 31 \nat 8). If this prior engagement is considered by the parties to satisfy the terms of the Settlement \nAgreement, then this reform has no value because \"[p ]ast consideration ... cannot form the basis \nfor a binding contract.\" Cont'! Ins. Co. v. Rutledge & Co., Inc., 750 A.2d 1219, 1232 (Del. Ch. \n2000). If this prior engagement does not satisfy the terms of the Settlement Agreement, then this \nreform could be nothing more than the Company spending money on a second independent \nconsultant that will likely duplicate the work performed by the previous consultant. Both Plaintiffs \nand its Expert discussed this reform in vague generic terms without explaining how it is new, \ndifferent, and better for this Company specifically. (See D.I. 34 at 17; D.I. 35-1 ,r,r 37-38). \nAccordingly, I cannot determine that this reform has any value, and therefore I consider that it has \nno value. \n\u2022 Establishment of a Chief Compliance Officer. The settlement requires the Company \nto create a Chief Compliance Officer. It also expressly sets forth the responsibilities of \nthe Chief Compliance Officer, which includes providing a quarterly written report to \nthe Audit & Risk Committee regarding any alleged compliance issues, financial fraud, \nor reporting violations. (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 2). \n11 This reform, like the reform directly above, is intended to address allegations in the \nComplaint that the Company lacked the necessary internal controls. Nevertheless, these reforms \nare not a substantial departure from the status quo. Before the settlement, the Company did not \nhave a formal Chief Compliance Officer. (D.I. 31 at 8). But its General Counsel \"generally \ndischarged the duties\" required by the settlement. (Id.). And, the settlement allows the duties of \nthe new Chief Compliance Officer to be discharged by the General Counsel. (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 2). One \npotential change is that the reforms require the General Counsel's compliance reports always to \nbe in writing and at least to be quarterly, which was not necessarily the practice. (D.I. 31 at 8 n. \n8). Thus, the Court finds these reforms to be modest and incremental. \n\u2022 Amendments to the Compensation Committee Charter. The Corporate Governance \nReforms amend the Compensation Committee Charter to include requirements that the \nCompensation Committee take into account an executive 's performance as it relates to \nlegal compliance and compliance with internal policies when determining or \napproving: (i) that executive 's compensation and (ii) termination benefits and/or \nseparation pay for departing executives. (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 7). \nThese reforms are intended to address allegations in the Complaint that the Individual \nDefendants financially benefited from their breaches of fiduciary duty by selling Company stock \nwhile it was artificially inflated by their false and misleading statements. But it is doubtful these \nreforms will provide a strong deterrent for potential bad behavior by executives, because these \nreforms \"shall not affect payments or benefits that are required to be paid pursuant to the \nCompany's plans, policies, or agreements. \" (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 7). Accordingly, this reform provides a \nmodest benefit. \n\u2022 Employee Training in Risk Assessment and Compliance . The Corporate Governance \nReforms require the Company to institute regular employee training concerning the \nCompany's risk assessment and compliance , the Code of Conduct, and the Insider \nTrading Policy. (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 8). \nThese reforms are intended to address allegations in the Complaint that certain Individual \nDefendants violated the Company 's Code of Conduct and Insider Trading Policy. (D .I. 31 at 12). \n12 Before the settlement, the Company trained new employees on these topics, but it did not have a \nregular training program on these topics for current employees. (Id. at 10). Thus, these reforms \nprovide a substantial benefit. These reforms directly address allegations in the Complaint. And, \nas Plaintiffs' expert reports, \"Regular employee training will sensitize all Impinj 's employees to \nthe need for legal compliance and fidelity to the Company 's internal Code of Conduct.\" (D.I. 35-\n1 ,r 50). \"This knowledge should also make it possible for potential whistleblowers to better \nidentify questionable conduct at the Company and report it.\" (Id.). \n\u2022 Amendments to the Whistleblower Policy. As part of the settlement, the Company \nmust amend its Whistleblower Policy to provide certain additional notifications to \nImpinj employees, contractors and agents-namely, that executives may be subject to \ncriminal penalties (including imprisonment) for retaliation against whistleblowers and \nthat whistleblowers who direct their complaints to an outside regulator or governmental \nentity are protected by the terms of the Policy just as if they directed their complaints \ninternally. (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 4). \nAlthough these reforms might have value in the abstract, they have none in the context of \nthis settlement, because they do not address any harms or wrongdoing alleged in Plaintiffs' \nComplaint. There are no allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint regarding retaliation against a \nwhistleblower or allegations that a whistleblower was prevented or discouraged from directing \ntheir complaint to an outside regulator. Instead, Plaintiffs allege that the Company received a \ncomplaint from a former employee upon which the Audit Committee commenced an independent \ninvestigation. (D.I. 1 ,r 7). And, the former employee later withdrew the complaint from the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"). (D.I. 31 at 5). The fact that the \nemployee filed the complaint with OSHA indicates that the Company's employees were aware of \ntheir right to direct complaints to an outside regulator or governmental agency. \n\u2022 Amendments to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter. The \nCorporate Governance Reforms amend the Nominating and Corporate Governance \nCommittee Charter to include (i) a requirement that the Nominating and Corporate \nGovernance Committee meet with prospective new Board members; (ii) a provision \nthat the Committee may periodically engage a corporate governance expert to review \n13 the Company 's director nomination process; and (iii) a requirement that the Committee \nreview the Company 's Corporate Governance Guidelines annually . (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 6). \nPlaintiffs admit, \"This reform was tangential to the issues in the litigation and were \nincluded in the demand letter to negotiate improving general corporate governance. \" (D.I. 34 at \n8). The Court itself sees no direct connection between these reforms and the harms alleged in the \nComplaint. Accordingly , these reforms provide little benefit. \n\u2022 Amendments to the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance \nReforms amend the Company 's Corporate Governance Guidelines to provide that, in \norder to be deemed \"independent ,\" a director must not only satisfy NASDAQ 's Listing_ \nRule 5605 and any other statutory independence requirement , but must also (i) have \nhad no personal service contract for more than $120,000 in the preceding twelve-month \nperiod with any member of the Company 's executive management , (ii) not be \nemployed by a public company at which an Impinj executive officer serves as a \ndirector, or (iii) is not a member of the immediate family of any person described in (i) \nand (ii). (D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 10). \nI see little connection between these reforms and the harms alleged in the Complaint. As \nif to underscore this fact, these reforms would not have changed the composition of the Board at \nthe time of the alleged harm. Before the settlement , the Company determined \"independence \" \nbased on Listing Rule 5605. (D.I. 31 at 11). If the Company also employed items (i)-(iii) in its \ndetermination of director independence (which it did not at the time), the Impinj directors deemed \nindependent during the relevant time period, July 21, 2016 through February 15, 2018, would have \nstill been considered to be independent. (Id. at 11 n. 9). Thus, the Court finds that the reforms \nprovide minimal benefit. \n\u2022 New Board Member. The Corporate Governance Reforms require the Impinj Board to \nuse its best efforts to add one new independent director to the Board by the end of 2021. \n(D.I. 13-1 \u00a7 9). \nAt the time Plaintiffs filed their complaint , the Company 's board had 7 directors: its CEO \nChris Diorio and 6 outside independent directors. (D.I. 1 ,r 22-26, 37-53, 140; Tr. 15:4-20). One \nadditional independent director was added before the case settled, and 2 additional independent \n14 directors were added after the case settled, for a total of 10 directors, 9 of which are independent. \n(Tr. 13:8-9; D.I. 31 at 10). \nI am having some difficulty in weighing the value a new independent director for this \nCompany. In Tile Shop, plaintiffs argued that the appointment of a new director tipped an evenly \ndivided six-person board to majority independent. See D.I. 35-7 at 26:13-19 (In re Tile Shop \nHoldings, Inc. S'holder Derivative Litig., C.A. No. 10884-VCG (Del. Ch. Aug. 23, 2018)). But \nthis argument was based on factual inaccuracies. At the time the initial complaints were filed, the \nboard was composed of 8 directors. (Id. at 29:3-16). By the time the last complaint in the \nconsolidated action was filed, it was 7. (Id.). There was no dispute that 5 of the 8 (and later 4 of \nthe 7) directors were independent. (Id.). Recognizing the corrected facts, the court nevertheless \nfound that \"(t]he effect of having an independent director on a board that is even close ... is a very \nsubstantial improvement for the corporation. \" (Id. at 41: 15-21). Here the appointment of a new \ndirector does not tip the board from majority dependent to majority independent. In addition, the \ndifference between the number of independent and dependent directors is not even close. 4 \nPlaintiffs contend that the addition of a new independent director will always be a \nsubstantial benefit even if a hypothetical company already has a very large board comprised \nentirely of independent directors and the CEO. (Tr. 17: 11-18: 15). I have my doubts. There has \nto be a point of diminishing returns. Defendants contend that \"refresh[ing] or add(ing]\" new \ndirectors to the Board after alleged misconduct can give the Board a more independent view of \nhow to analyze those allegations. (Id. at 18 :24-11 ). That is certainly a strong argument in a case \n4 Plaintiffs cited other cases where courts approved settlements involving the appointment \nof a new independent director, but these rulings were presented mostly in the form of orders with \nno discussion of the harms alleged or the composition of the board. See D.I. 34 at 27-28 (citing In \nre TerraForm Power, Inc. Deriv. Litig., No. 11898-CB (Del. Ch. Dec. 19, 2016) (D.I. 35-12) and \nIn re OSI Sys., Inc. Deriv. Litig., 2017 WL 5642304 (C.D. Cal. May 2, 2017)). Accordingly , Tile \nShop is this Court's only basis for comparison. \n15 where the board refreshes ( or replaces) directors instead of just adding new ones. It requires closer \nscrutiny when the board is only adding. \nFinally, Plaintiffs ' have provided an expert opinion touting the consensus view that the \npresence of independent directors is good for companies. (D.I. 35-1 ,r 54). Consistent with this \nview, the number of independent directors has increased dramatically over time, from 20% in 1950 \nto 75% in 2005. Jeffrey N. Gordon, The Rise of Independent Directors in the United States, \n1950-2005: Of Shareholder Value and Stock Market Prices, 59 Stan. L. Rev. 1465 (2007). In \naddition, at the federal level, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the listing standards for NYSE \nand NASDAQ require that companies with widely-held stock have a majority independent board.5 \nDevelopments in the Law-Corporations and Society, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 2169, 2187 (2004). \nIn summary , I cannot conclude that the addition of a new independent director has no \nbenefit. At the same time, I have reservations about concluding that a new independent director \nin this case provided a substantial benefit for this Company . Thus, I will settle somewhere in the \nmiddle. \nThe Court must now weigh the value of all these reforms together. A few of the reforms \nhave little to no benefit, a few of the reforms have meaningful or substantial benefits, and several \nof the reforms have modest benefits. Accordingly , this is not a case where the benefits achieved \nwere overwhelmingly substantial. It is also not a case where Plaintiffs achieved no benefits at all. \n5 As often happens when people exclusively favor practices perceived as good, eventually \nsomeone starts to question whether too much of a good thing is still good. While not questioning \nthat a majority of independent directors is a good thing, there are doubters that the benefits of a \n\"supermajority\" of independent directors outweigh the detriments . See Olubunmi Faleye, The \nDownside to Full Board Independence , MIT Sloan Management Review, 87-88 (Winter 2017); \nSteven Davidoff Solomon , The Case Against Too Much Independence on the Board, N.Y. Times, \nNov. 11, 2013, available at https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/11 /the-case-against-too-much\u00ad\nindependence-on-the-board/ (last visited November 17, 2020). \n16 Notably absent from the settlement are any consequences for the Individual Defendants \nwho were accused of unjust enrichment or robust reforms designed to strongly deter insider \ntrading. This could be an indication of a weakness in Plaintiffs ' claims or a weakness in the \nbenefits obtained. Plaintiffs did admit that the unjust enrichment claim faced a \"larger dismissal \nrisk.\" (Tr. 19:12-21:12). Given the weaknesses in Plaintiffs' claims, the Court finds that settling \nthis action for the overall value of the benefits achieved satisfies the standard for awarding \nattorneys' fees. See In re Cox Radio, Inc. S'holders Litig., 2010 WL 1806616, at *20 (Del. Ch. \nMay 6, 2010) ( approving settlement as fair and reasonable and awarding attorneys ' fees where \n\"the benefits gained were modest\" but \"the claims released were weak\"). The Court now turns to \nthe calculation of those fees. \n2. The Calculation of Attorneys' Fees \nFor the Third Circuit, there are two primary methods for calculating attorneys ' fees: the \npercentage-of-recovery method and the lodestar method. Here, because the settlement was based \non corporate governance reforms and has no monetary component , the Court must apply the \nlodestar method. See In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d 294,300 (3d Cir. 2005) (explaining \nthat the lodestar method is applied in cases where the nature of the recovery does not allow for \napplication of the percentage-of-recovery method); see also In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales \nPractice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 333 (3d Cir. 1998) (\"The percentage-of-recovery \nmethod is generally favored in cases involving a common fund.\"). \nThe lodestar method multiplies the number of hours counsel worked by a reasonable hourly \nbilling rate, resulting in a total amount called a \"lodestar.\" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d at 164. A \nreasonable hourly rate is based on the prevailing market rates in the relevant geographic area for \nsimilar services by lawyers of comparable skill, experience , and reputation. Maldonado v. \nHoustoun , 256 F .3d 181, 184 (3d Cir. 2001 ). The \"lodestar multiplier \" equals the total fee award \n17 divided by the lodestar. In re AT&T, 455 F.3d at 164. The lodestar multiplier can be adjusted \nupward or downward to account for particular circumstances , \"such as the quality of \nrepresentation , the benefit obtained for the class, the complexity and novelty of the issues \npresented, and the risks involved. \" Id at 164 n. 4. \nBecause this action is a consolidation of three related actions, Plaintiffs ' counsel is \ncomprised of four law firms. The Brown Law Firm, P.C., based in New York, which worked \n321.7 hours for a lodestar of$191,732.50. (D.I. 35-14 ~ 6). The Rosen Law Firm, P.A., also based \nin New York, which worked 188.38 hours for a lodestar of $119,925.25. (D.I. 35-15 ~ 6). Bragar \nEagel & Squire, P.C., also based in New York, which worked 144.00 hours for a lodestar of \n$89,537.50. (D.I. 35-17 ~ 6). And, finally, Farnan LLP, based in Delaware , which served as \nliaison counsel. It worked 10.8 hours for a lodestar of $6,763.50. (D.I. 35-16 ~ 6). Accordingly , \nPlaintiffs' Counsel have spent a total of 664.88 hours on this matter for an overall lodestar of \n$407,958 .75.6 The requested fee is 2.206 times the overall lodestar achieved by summing those \nnumbers.7 (See D.I. 34 at 29). \n6 By the Court's own calculations , the 664.88 hours Counsel worked on this matter can be \nbroken down as follows: approximately 132 hours (20% of the time) on litigation up to and \nincluding obtaining the stay, approximately 193 hours (about 30% of the time) on settlement \nnegotiations, up to and including execution of the settlement stipulation, and approximately 340 \nhours (about 50% of the time) on obtaining preliminary and final approval of the settlement. These \nnumbers are somewhat skewed because one of the law firms migrated to new billing software and \nin the process lost its time records for the period before the settlement. (D.I. 35-15; Tr. 30:16-\n31 :4). \nThe amount of time spent on obtaining approval of the settlement concerns me. I note that \nplaintiff's counsel in In re Santander cut off the accumulation of hours as of the date the parties \nsigned the settlement stipulation, which raises questions about whether the same should have been \ndone here. See D.I. 35-8 at 17:15-18 (In re Santander Consumer USA Holdings , Inc. Derivative \nLitig., C.A. No. 11614-VCG (Del. Ch. Jan. 20, 2021)). The circumstances here are a bit unusual \ngiven the lost time records, but the Court sees merit in giving this issue closer scrutiny in future \nsettlements . \n7 Plaintiffs ' Counsel calculated the overall lodestar amount as $407,537.50. (See D.I. 34 at \n29). The difference from my calculation of $407,958.75 is immaterial. It does not materially \n18 As described in their declarations , the work performed by the three law firms based in New \nYork was exactly the same. (See D.I. 35-17 at ,r 4; D.I. 35-14 ,r 4; D.I. 35-15 ,r 4). This raises \nquestions regarding duplication of efforts. But it could also reflect the fact that the three actions \nwere initially brought individually and the case progressed little past the consolidation stage where \nmore division of labor would be expected. Setting that concern to one side, a careful review of \neach law firm's declaration shows that the number of hours worked on the tasks described and the \nrates charged are reasonable , taking into account the position of the timekeeper (paralegal , \nassociate, or partner), the relevant geographic area, and the skill, experience, and reputation of the \nfirms involved. \nThe Court must next determine whether the 2.21 lodestar multiplier should be adjusted \nupward or downward to account for particular circumstances. There are several indications that \nthe lodestar multiplier requested here is too high. \nFirst, the benefits obtained for the Company were overall modest. In cases where plaintiffs \nachieved similar benefits, the lodestar multipliers of the fees awarded were well below the 2.21 \nrequested here. Specifically , they were 1.1 and 1.04 respectively. See D.I. 35-7 at 14:8-15, 43:3-\n11 (In re Tile Shop) (requesting a fee of $1.7 million which had a lodestar multiplier of 1.5 and \nreceiving a fee award of $1.25 million, which has an implied lodestar multiplier of 1.1 ); D .I. 3 5-8 \nat 16:20, 17:15-22, 19:20-21 (In re Santander) (receiving a fee award of $1.5 million which had a \nlodestar multiplier of 1.04). \nSecond, the issues presented here were not particularly novel or complex. This action is a \nfollow-on to a federal securities fraud class action. All the information on which Plaintiffs relied \nimpact the calculation of the lodestar multiplier, which is 2.206 with Plaintiffs ' calculations or \n2.208 with mine. Since I cannot account for why there is the modest difference in calculation , I \nwill round off the proposed multiplier to 2.21. \n19 to file their individual complaints and negotiate the governance reforms that comprised the \nsettlement was in the public domain. (Tr. 32:20-33 :6). Plaintiffs ' Counsel did not have to \nvigorously prosecute the action in order to obtain the settlement. The only substantive work they \ndid was file the original complaints. They did not make a books and record demand pursuant to 8 \nDel. C. \u00a7 220, draft a consolidated complaint , or face a motion to dismiss. \nThird, I am concerned with rewarding somewhat redundant efforts that resulted in legal \nremedies with no meaningful consequences for the alleged wrongdoers. Specifically, all three law \nfirms alleged that eight individuals committed negligent federal securities' violations, breached \ntheir fiduciary duties, and were unjustly enriched. All three law firms made the same modest effort \nto pursue those allegations. And all three law firms achieved the same fruitless result: The \nsettlement recovers nothing against any of the individuals. This indicates to me an exceptionally \nweak case. And yet for this work, each of the three law firms ask to be rewarded with a lodestar \nmultiplier that doubles their normal rate of compensation. \"The court can adjust the lodestar \ndownward if the lodestar is not reasonable in light of the results obtained.\" Rode v. Dellarciprete , \n892 F.2d 1177, 1183 (3d Cir. 1990). \nTaking these facts into consideration , the Court finds that an attorneys ' fee award of \n$424,277.10 is appropriate , which applies a lodestar multiplier of 1.04, and to which I add in the \nparties' unreimbursed expenses of$15,468.02 (D.I. 35, 13), for a total of$439,745.12. \nC. Service Awards \nPlaintiffs have requested a \"service award,\" also called an \"incentive award,\" of $2,000 for \neach Plaintiff, amounting to $8,000 total. (D.I. 33-1 , 10). The Parties propose to deduct the \nservice awards from the attorneys ' fees awarded to Plaintiffs ' counsel. (Id.). \n20 In federal courts, \"[i]ncentive awards are not uncommon in class action litigation and \nparticularly where ... a common fund has been created for the benefit of the entire class.\" 8 Sullivan \nv. DB Investments, Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 333 n. 65 (3d Cir. 2011) (omission in original) (quoting \n' \nLorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 205 F.R.D. 369, 376 (D.D.C. 2002)). \"Nor is (an \nincentive award] necessaril y compelled in each case.\" Fry v. Hayt, Hayt & Landau, 198 F.R.D. \n461, 473 (E.D. Pa. 2000). In comparison , incentive awards in Delaware state courts \"should be \nrare\" and granted \"[o]nly in the exceptional case.\"9 Morrison v. Berry, 2021 WL 2926138, at *1 \n(Del. Ch. July 12, 2021 ). Thus, federal and state courts in Delaware may have some variation in \nthe frequency with which they grant plaintiffs incentive awards, likely attributed to the different \ntypes of class actions regularly seen in their courts, but neither federal nor state courts grant such \nawards automaticall y.10 \n\"Service awards are within the discretion of the Court to approve.\" Devine v. Northeast \nTreatment Centers, Inc., 2021 WL 4803819, at *9 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 14, 2021). \"The purpose of these \npayments is to compensate named plaintiffs for the services they provided and the risks they \nincurred during the course of class action litigation,\" and to \"reward the public service of \n8 For example, \"[i]ncentive payments play an important role in [Fair Labor Standards Act] \nlitigation,\" Shabazz v. Colonial Park Care Ctr. LLC, 2021 WL 4860770, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 19, \n2021 ), because \"individuals who serve as named plaintiffs in employment rights cases do so at the \nrisk of their current and future employment ,\" Caddick v. Tasty Baking Co., 2021 WL 4989587, at \n*10 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 27, 2021). \n9 For example, in Raider v. Sunderland , a Delaware state court granted an incentive award \nof $42,400, which came out of class counsel's fee, based on \"a total of 205 hours\" the class \nrepresentative spent mostly on matters involving his expertise in \"tax and financial analyses.\" \n2006 WL 75310, at *2. \n10 Plaintiffs cite In re Cendant Corp., Derivative Action Litig., for the proposition that \nincentive awards paid out from the attorneys ' fees awarded to plaintiff's counsel \"need not be \nsubject to intensive scrutiny, as the interests of the corporation , the public, and the defendants are \nnot directly affected.\" 232 F. Supp. 2d 327, 344 (D.N.J. 2002). But this does not suggest that a \nrequest for incentive awards should get no scrutiny. \n21 contributing to the enforcement of mandatory laws.\" Sullivan, 667 F.3d at 333 n. 65 (quoting \nBredbenner v. Liberty Travel, Inc., 2011 WL 1344745, at *22 (D.N.J. Apr. 8, 2011)). In order \"to \nbe entitled to an incentive award,\" a \"plaintiff must show: (1) the risks that the named plaintiff \nundertook in commencing class action; (2) any additional burdens assumed by named plaintiffs \nbut not unnamed class members ; and (3) the benefits generated to class members through named \nplaintiffs efforts.\" Fry v. Hayt, Hayt & Landau, 198 F.R.D. at 473. \nHere, I do not see much basis for any service awards other than a general statement: \n\"Each of the Plaintiffs discussed the pleadings and case strategy with their counsel. Also, they \neach were involved with the settlement and approved the Settlement. \" (D.I. 35 ,r 94). When I \nreview the billing time sheets, I see little communication with Plaintiffs. One New York law \nfirm spent 5.25 hours communicating with its client, another New York law firm spent only 0.5 \nhours doing the same, and the last New York law firm has no record of communicating with its \nclient, only communicating internally about the client. (See D.I. 35-14, Ex. 2; D.I. 35-15, Ex. 2; \nD.I. 35-17, Ex. 2). Thus, in the absence of any efforts by Plaintiffs to differentiate among the \nPlaintiffs in terms of contributions to the litigation, I will award $375 to each Plaintiff, which \nrepresents five hours of each Plaintiffs time at $75 per hour, and is probably more than is \njustified by the briefing. Should counsel point me to entries in the billing records that support \ngreater involvement by Plaintiffs in the cases, or produce other information that suggests a \nreason for a greater award, I will consider amending the final order accordingl y. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs ' Motion for Final Approval of the Settlement is \ngranted. The settlement as set forth in the Stipulation is fair, reasonable , and adequate and is finally \napproved. Plaintiffs ' request for Attorneys' Fees and Service Awards is granted. The Court \n22 awards $439,745.12 in attorneys ' fees and expenses and $375 each (for $1,500 total) in service \nawards to be paid from the attorneys' fees. An appropriate order will be entered. \n23 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nIN RE IMPINJ, INC. DERIVATIVE \nLITIGATION , C.A.
