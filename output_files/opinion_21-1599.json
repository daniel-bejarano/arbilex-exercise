Civil Action No. 21-1599-RGA\nCIMARRON CAPITAL, LTD., 5\n\nDefendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff.\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPresently before the court in this declaratory judgment action arising from the parties\u2019\ncontractual obligations is Enzolytics, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cENZC\u201d or \u201cCounterclaim Defendant\u201d) Motion to\nDismiss (\u201cMotion\u201d), (D.I. 26), Cimarron Capital, Ltd.\u2019s (\u201cCimarron\u201d or \u201cCounterclaim\nPlaintiff\u2019) First Amended Counterclaim (\u201cFACC\u201d) alleging breach of contract. (D.I. 25).! For\nthe following reasons, I recommend GRANTING ENZC\u2019s Motion.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThis action arises out of Cimarron\u2019s allegations that ENZC is in breach of two separate\ndebentures. On November 3, 2009, and January 11, 2010, Cimarron entered into two debentures\nwith an entity known as Extreme Mobile Coatings Worldwide Corp. (\u201cExtreme Mobile\u201d) which\nCimarron alleges is ENZC\u2019s predecessor in interest. (D.I. 25 at {{ 1, 6, 30, 36; see D.I. 15 Exs.\n1-2) Under the first debenture, Extreme Mobile received from Cimarron $100,000.00 at an 8%\n\nannual interest rate from Cimarron. (D.I. 25 at ] 31; see D.I. 15, Ex. 1 at 1) In return, Extreme\n\n' The briefing for the Motion is as follows: Counterclaim Defendant\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 27),\nCounterclaim Plaintiff's answering brief (D.I. 29), and Counterclaim Defendant\u2019s reply brief\n\n1.31).\nMobile promised to pay the required principal and interest. (/d.) The second debenture followed\nthe same format and contained identical language, except that Cimarron provided Extreme\nMobile with $50,000.00 at an 8% annual interest rate. (D.I. 25 at 37; see D.I. 15, Ex. 2 at 1)\n\nAdditionally, under the terms of each debenture, Cimarron possessed the option to\nconvert the debentures into shares of common stock rather than demand payment. (D.I. 25 at [f\n32, 38; D.I. 15, Exs. 1-2 at 1) Neither debenture imposed any time limitations on Cimarron\u2019s\nability to convert the debentures, providing Cimarron with full discretion on whether, and when,\nit chose to exercise this right. (D.L. 25 at ff 33, 39; D.I. 15, Exs. 1-2, at \u00a72) Both debentures\nare governed by New York law. (/d. at J 14)\n\nOn November 14 and 15, 2020, Cimarron alleges it communicated with Billy V. Ray\n(\u201cRay\u201d), an \u201cofficer\u201d of ENZC, about its intention to convert the debentures into shares of\ncommon stock. (D.I. 25 at ff 7, 57-58) On November 15, 2020, Ray responded with an email\ntelling Cimarron that ENZC needed an opinion letter prior to any conversion and that ENZC\nwould not initiate any conversions before November 26, 2020. (/d. at 60) Cimarron claims\nENZC failed to issue the shares of common stock, thus breaching the contract. (/d. at J] 68, 72)\nCimarron alleges that had the debentures been converted, it would have received 30,000,000\nshares of ENZC. (Jd. at | 75)\n\nCimarron claims that on or about November 19, 2020, a merger occurred wherein ENZC\nissued shares of common stock on favorable terms to other entities upon conversion of their\ndebentures, without providing notice to Cimarron. (/d. at J] 42-43, 61-63, 67, 71) Cimarron\ncontends that the intended purpose of the merger was to defraud certain stakeholders, such as\n\nCimarron. (/d. at [{ 47, 64)\nIn its Declaratory Judgment Complaint in this action, ENZC asserts that it was not a\nparty to either debenture, is not the successor to Extreme Mobile, and has not assumed the\nliabilities of the debentures. (See e.g., D.I. 1 at [J 12, 20, 27, 31, 33) ENZC alleges that\nExtreme Mobile is a predecessor to ENZC Sub, Inc. (/d. at ] 13) ENZC is the publicly traded\nparent of ENZC Sub, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary.\u201d (Id. at ff] 26, 32)\n\nCimarron continues to assert that ENZC is in breach of the debentures. (/d. at \u00a7 60-61)\nOn November 12, 2021, ENZC instituted this Declaratory Judgment action. (D.I. 1) Cimarron\nresponded with its Answer and Counterclaim on March 4, 2022. (D.I. 12) On April 18, 2022,\nCimarron filed the FACC, the operative pleading at issue in this Motion. (D.I. 25) ENZC\nmoved to dismiss the FACC on May 6, 2022. (D.I. 26) This court has diversity jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) because ENZC is a Delaware corporation and Cimarron is a\nNevada corporation with its principal place of business in Boca Raton, Florida. (D.I. 1 at \u00a7\u00a5 2-3;\nD.L. 25 at \u00a7 2)\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542 F.3d 59,\n64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\n\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\n\n2 The issue of whether ENZC is contractually obligated for the debentures is not before the court\nin the pending Motion which only concerns whether the allegations in the FACC are facially\nplausible.\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\nv. Igbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\n\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nUnder New York law, \u201c[t]he essential elements for pleading . . . breach of contract are\nthe existence of a contract, the plaintiff's performance pursuant to the contract, the defendant's\nbreach of his or her contractual obligations, and damages resulting from the breach.\u201d Dee v.\nRakower, 112 A.D.3d 204, 208-09 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013). In support of its Motion, ENZC\nmakes three arguments: (1) Cimarron failed to plead sufficient facts showing ENZC was\nobligated under section 9(d)(i) of the debentures to provide Cimarron notice prior to the merger,\n\n(2) Cimarron failed to allege that it satisfied the notice requirement in sections 4 and 12 of the\ndebentures, a condition precedent to Cimarron\u2019s right to convert, and (3) the FACC is redundant\nof the Declaratory Judgment Complaint. (D.I. 27 at 4-9)\n\nA. Cimarron Fails to Plausibly Allege ENZC Was Obligated to Provide Notice\n\nENZC argues that Cimarron failed to plead facts suggesting ENZC had a contractual duty\nto provide notice of the merger. (Jd. at 4-6) Specifically, ENZC asserts that Cimarron\u2019s FACC\ncontains no factual assertions that ENZC took an action as described in section 9(d)(i) which\nrequired adjustment of the Conversion Price of the debentures, triggering the notice requirement.\n(Id. at 5) ENZC further argues that Cimarron fails to plead that notice of the merger is not\nexcused. (/d.)\n\nSection 9(d)(i) in each of the debentures plainly states:\n\nIfat any time the Company shall take any action which would require an adjustment\n\nof the Conversion Price, including, but not limited to . . . (C) there shall be any\n\ncapital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or a\n\nconsolidation or merger of the Company with another corporation (other than a\n\nmerger in which the Company is the continuing corporation, and which does not\n\nresult in any reclassification or change of the then outstanding common stock or\n\nother capital stock issuable upon exercise of the Convertible Debenture, other than\n\na change in par value or subdivision or combination of such shares)... then. . . the\n\nCompany shall cause to be mailed to each of the holders of outstanding Convertible\n\nDebenture, at the earliest practicable time (and in any event not less than 20 days\n\nbefore any record date or other date set for definitive action), written notice of the\n\ndate on which the books of the Company shall close or a record shall be taken for\n\nsuch dividend, distribution of, grant of subscription rights, or such winding up shall\n\ntake place, as the case may be.\n(D.I. 15, Exs. 1-2) (emphasis added)\n\nSection 9(d)(i) of the debentures specifically excludes notice when the company is a\ncontinuing corporation. The FACC is silent on whether Cimarron contends ENZC is not the\n\ncontinuing company following the merger and, thus, would not be excused from the notice\n\nrequirement. Cimarron does not allege that the company ceased to exist after the merger and\nmakes no effort to address this argument in its answering brief, focusing instead on conclusory\nallegations that ENZC reclassified or changed the outstanding common stock.\n\nCimarron argues it sufficiently alleged ENZC breached section 9(d)(i) because the\nmerger allegedly was an action that required an adjustment of the Conversion Price under that\nsection. (D.I. 29 at 7) When it makes this argument in its answering brief, Cimarron cites to\nparagraphs 75-76 of the FACC. (/d.) However, no such language is contained in those\nparagraphs.\u2019 The FACC alleges only the fact that a merger occurred and that notice to Cimarron\nwas required under section 9(d)(i). (D.I. 25 at ff 42, 64, 67, 71) Nowhere in the FACC are there\nany facts about the merger or ENZC\u2019s role in it nor what action required an adjustment of the\nConversion Price under section 9(d)(i).\n\nFurther, Cimarron relies on material outside of the FACC, for example, that ENZC\noperates under a \u201cveil of secrecy\u201d and that Cimarron served a books and records request,\npursuant to 8 Del. C. \u00a7 220, to obtain documents about the merger. (D.I. 29 at 7; see also id., Ex.\nA) Cimarron argues its allegations in the FACC are enough at this stage given its scant\ninformation about the merger and speculates that future discovery will support its claim for\nbreach of contract. (D.I. 29 at 7)\n\nThe court will not consider Cimarron\u2019s arguments in its answering brief that do not\nappear in its pleading. See Pa. ex rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, Inc., 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir.\n1998) (\u201c[T]he complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to\n\ndismiss.\u201d). Moreover, the pleading cannot survive dismissal based on speculation that future\n\n3 The cited paragraphs state the following: \u201cIf the Cimarron Debentures had been properly\nconverted, Cimarron would have received 30,000,000 shares of Enzolytics.\u201d (D.I. 25 at J 75)\n\u201cOn or about November 30, 2020, the value of Enzolytics\u2019 common stock was approximately\n$0.11 per share.\u201d (Id. at 1 76)\ndiscovery about the merger will save the claim that ENZC breached the notice requirement in\nsection 9(d)(i) of the debentures.\n\nB. Cimarron\u2019s New Theory of Equitable Estoppel Has Not Been Plausibly Pled\n\nCimarron alleges ENZC breached section 13 of the debentures when it failed to issue\nshares of ENZC\u2019s successor company. (D.I. 25 at f\u00a5 68, 72) Section 13 states:\n\nThe amount due under this Convertible Debenture, and any and all shares shall follow\n\nand become the obligation of any successor company in which the Maker is sold to,\n\nmerged with or any other combination, including a swap of shares, totaling more than\n\n50% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Maker.\n\n(D.I. 15, Exs. 1-2)\n\nENZC argues that the FACC fails to state a claim that ENZC breached an obligation to\nissue shares pursuant to section 13 because Cimarron failed to satisfy the condition precedent of\nproviding written notice as required in sections 4 and 12 of the debentures. (D.I. 27 at 6-7)\nSection 4 provides:\n\nUpon presentation and surrender of this Convertible Debenture, with a Written Notice of\n\nConversion duly executed, at the principal office of the Company, or any successor\n\nprincipal office of the company, addressed to the CEO of the Company, the Company\n\nshall deliver to [Cimarron], as promptly as practicable, certificates representing the\n\nConversion Shares being purchased.\n\n(D.I. 15, Exs. 1-2) Section 12 states:\n\nAll notices required by this Convertible Debenture to be given or made by the Company\n\nshall be given or made by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the registered\n\nholder hereof at the address of such holder as shown on the books of the Company.\n(Id.)\nUnder New York law, \u201c[iJt is well settled that no action for breach of contract lies where\n\nthe party seeking to enforce the contract has failed to perform a specified condition precedent.\u201d\n\nCarr v. Birnbaum, 75 A.D.3d 972, 973 (N.Y. App. Div. 2010).\nIn its answering brief, Cimarron fails to address the written notice requirement for\nconversion in sections 4 and 12 of the debentures nor does the FACC plead any facts suggesting\nCimarron complied with the notice requirement. (See D.I. 29; D.I. 25) Instead, Cimarron argues\nfor the first time that ENZC should be estopped from raising lack of notice as a defense for not\nconverting the debentures because Cimarron detrimentally relied on Ray\u2019s representation that\nENZC was not initiating any conversions until November 26, 2020, at the earliest. (D.I. 29 at 7\u2014\n9)\n\nENZC argues Cimarron has insufficiently pled the elements of equitable estoppel because\nthere is nothing in the FACC alleging that Ray had apparent authority to bind ENZC or that\nCimarron reasonably relied on Ray\u2019s representations to its detriment. (D.I. 31 at 3-5)\n\nTo establish an equitable estoppel claim under New York law, the party to be estopped\nmust (1) have made a false representation or concealed material facts; (2) had the intention that\nthis misrepresentation would be acted upon by the other party; and (3) have knowledge of the\nreal facts. Rich v. Orlando, 128 A.D.3d 1330, 1331 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015). Further, the party\nasserting estoppel must show: \u201c(1) lack of knowledge of the true facts; (2) good faith reliance;\nand (3) a change of position.\u201d Jd. See also Fundamental Portfolio Advisors, Inc. v. Tocqueville\nAsset Management, L.P., 850 N.E.2d 653, 659 (N.Y. 2006) (discussing the purpose of the\ndoctrine is to prevent injustice to a party who justifiably relied upon another\u2019s words or conduct\nto their disadvantage).\n\nCimarron argues that ENZC \u201cstrung Cimarron along until the [mJerger\u201d occurring\nsometime around November 19, 2020, in order to avoid its contractual obligations under the\ndebentures. (D.I. 29 at 2) In its FACC, Cimarron alleges it had various email communications\n\nwith Ray in which Cimarron expressed its intention to convert the debentures, but Ray\npurposefully stalled for time such as by putting off the conversion due to his \u201csituation\u201d and by\nrequiring Cimarron to provide an opinion letter. (D.I. 25 at [{ 57-60)* In one of the emails,\nCimarron alleges Ray indicated ENZC \u201cwould not be initiating any conversions until November\n26 at the earliest.\u201d (Jd. at | 60)\n\nEven if the court considers the full content of the emails, they are not sufficient to plead\nthe equitable estoppel theory Cimarron now asserts. The FACC fails to allege any facts\nsupporting the elements of equitable estoppel nor does the FACC even mention the phrase.\nCimarron\u2019s attempt to supply the details in its answering brief falls short of its obligation to\ninclude the elements of equitable estoppel in a facially plausible pleading. See Pa. ex rel.\nZimmerman, 836 F.2d at 181; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8.\n\nCimarron argues it has adequately pled good faith reliance on Ray\u2019s representations\nbecause Ray had apparent authority as director or officer of ENZC. (D.I. 29 at 8) Cimarron\u2019s\nargument that Ray\u2019s title imbues him with authority is unsupported. The only allegation in the\nFACC is that Ray is \u201can individual and an officer of [ENZC].\u201d (D.I. 25 at ] 7) There is nothing\nfurther alleged about his apparent authority or Cimarron\u2019s reliance on it for an equitable estoppel\nclaim.\n\nThus, even when construing the FACC in the light most favorable to Cimarron, the\nFACC cannot survive dismissal based on an equitable estoppel theory raised for the first time in\n\nCimarron\u2019s answering brief. See Abercrombie v. Andrew College, 438 F. Supp. 2d. 243, 265-68\n\n4 The FACC references the content of the emails in paragraphs 57\u201460 but does not attach them to\nthe pleading. The two emails in issue (one of which is redacted) are incorporated into\nCimarron\u2019s answering brief. (See D.I. 29 at 3-4) ENZC objects to their consideration. (D.I. 31\nat 1-2) But the court finds they are integral to the FACC and may be considered with the\npleading for purposes of the pending Motion. See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114\nF.3d at 1426 (noting a court may consider \u201cdocument[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon in\nthe complaint\u201d without converting the motion into one for summary judgment).\n\n9\n(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (dismissing the plaintiff's claims relying on the doctrine of equitable estoppel\nbecause the plaintiff failed to adequately plead the elements); Anderson Co. v. Devine, 202\nA.D.2d 382, 382 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994) (affirming an order granting the defendant\u2019s motion to\ndismiss because the plaintiffs failed to assert equitable estoppel in their complaint).\n\nCc. ENZC\u2019s Redundancy Argument is Rendered Moot\n\nFinally, ENZC argues that the court should dismiss Cimarron\u2019s FACC because it is\nredundant of ENZC\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Complaint. (D.I. 27 at 7-9) Cimarron contends\nthat its pleading is not redundant because the FACC does not seek a declaratory judgment but\nalleges a cause of action for breach of contract. (D.I. 29 at 9-10)\n\nENZC correctly identifies the mirror image legal standard that the court applies when\nresolving a motion to dismiss a redundant counterclaim. (D.I. 27 at 8) See Peloton Interactive,\nInc. v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., No. 20-cv-01535-RGA, 2021 WL 3794829 (D. Del. Aug.\n26, 2021). Without citing to any case authorities to support its position, Cimarron argues that its\ncounterclaim is not redundant because it relies on different facts than ENZC and seeks a different\nremedy, i.e., money damages and not declaratory relief. (D.I. 29 at 9-10) ENZC has not refuted\nCimarron\u2019s argument that its demand for money damages distinguishes the breach of contract\nclaim from the Declaratory Judgment action. (See D.I. 31 at 5-6)\n\nThe court finds it unnecessary to address the redundancy argument because it has\nrecommended dismissal of the FACC based on the pleading defects discussed, supra.\n\nAlternatively, Cimarron requests leave to amend its pleading a second time. (D.I. 29 at\n10) ENZC has not addressed Cimarron\u2019s request and the court finds amendment would not be\nfutile. See In re Burlington Coat Factory Secs. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1434 (\u201cleave to amend shall be\n\nfreely given\u201d unless amendment is futile). Therefore, the court grants leave to amend. The\n\n10\namended pleading shall be served no later than seven (7) days following the deadline for\nObjections pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) or upon further Order of the court following a ruling\non Objections, if any.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend GRANTING ENZC\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. (D.I.\n26) I also recommend GRANTING Cimarron\u2019s leave to amend its counterclaim. (D.I. 29 at 10)\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
