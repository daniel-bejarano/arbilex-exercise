{"case_name": "Duncan v. XTO Energy, Inc.", "case_number": "22-91", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "09-16-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nMATTHEW DUNCAN, Individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated, \nPlaintiff, \nV. Civil Action No. 22-0091-GBW \nXTO ENERGY, INC., \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington, Delaware this 15th day of September, 2022. \nHaving reviewed the parties' briefing and other materials filed with respect to Defendant \nXTO Energy, Inc.' s (\"XTO\") motion to stay pending the Supreme Court of the United States of \nAmerica's decision in Hewitt v. Helix Energy Solutions , Inc., No. 19-20023 (5th Cir. 2021), cert. \ngranted, 2022 WL 1295708 (U.S. May 2, 2022) (No. 21-984), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nXTO's motion (D.I. 23) is GRANTED, for the reasons stated below. It is further ORDERED that, \nwithin fourteen days following the ruling in Hewitt, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith \nand file a joint status report to notify the Court on the implications of that decision on each parties' \nrespective positions. \n1. On March 11, 2022, Plaintiff Matthew Duncan (\"Duncan\") filed an Amended Complaint \nagainst XTO to recover overtime allegedly owed to him and purportedly similar workers pursuant \nto the Fair Labor Standards Act \"(FLSA\") , 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207, et seq. D.I. 16. In response, XTO \nfiled a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (D.I. 19), asserting that Duncan and \nsimilarly situated workers are exempt from the FLSA's overtime provision under the highly \n1 compensated employee (\"HCE\") exemption . XTO's Motion to Dismiss is currently pending before \nthe Court. \n2. On May 2, 2022, while litigation matters in the present dispute were ongoing, the Supreme \nCourt granted certiorari to review the Fifth Circuit's en bane decision in Hewitt and address the \ncircuit split regarding whether the detailed requirements of the reasonable relationship test, 29 \nC.F .R. \u00a7 541.604, apply to an employee who qualifies under the HCE exemption of the FLSA. 29 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 541.601(a)(l). It is set for oral argument in early October. \n3. On May 25, 2022, XTO filed a Motion to Stay proceedings pending the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Hewitt. D.l. 23. Duncan contests the Motion to Stay. D.I. 26. While the parties \ndisagree about the impact the Supreme Court's decision in Hewitt will have on this case, neither \nparty claims that the decision will be irrelevant. \n4. On September 14, 2022, Duncan filed a Motion for Conditional Certification and Court\u00ad\nAuthorized Notice, along with a Motion for Expedited Consideration, requesting the Court \nconditionally certify a putative class of similarly situated workers and provide notice to such \npurported members . D.I. 29. XTO opposes Duncan's motion. D.I. 31. \n5. A court has discretionary authority to grant a motion to stay. See Dentsply Int 'l Inc. v. Kerr \nMfg. Co., 734 F. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Del. 1990). Courts generally consider three factors to \ndetermine whether a stay is appropriate: (1) whether granting the stay will simplify the issues for \ntrial; (2) the status of the litigation , particularl y whether discovery is complete and a trial date has \nbeen set; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non-movant to suffer undue prejudice from any \ndelay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage. See Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco \nHoldings LLC, C.A. No. 15-1168-LPS , 2021 WL 616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021) (citing \n2 Ethicon LLC v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., C.A. No. 17-871-LPS , 2019 WL 1276029, at *1 (D. Del. \nMar. 20, 2019)). In this action, these factors favor granting a stay. \n6. A stay would simplify the issues before this Court. To be considered exempt from overtime \nunder the HCE exemption , the FLSA requires the employee satisfy three tests: salary level, salary \nbasis, and duties. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.601(a) . The Supreme Court's decision in Hewitt will not only \ndecide whether HCEs must additionally meet the reasonable relationship test of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n541.604, but will also resolve whether the reasonable relationship test underlies the salary basis \ntest. Thus, the reasonable relationship test acts as the linchpin to interpreting the salary basis test. \nContinuing this litigation while one of those three tests hangs in the balance of the Supreme Court's \nreview would be contrary to judicial economy , while wasting the time and resources of both \nparties. \n7. The stage of this litigation weighs in favor of a stay. This dispute is at an early juncture, \nwith fact discovery yet to commence and no trial date set. \n8. A stay will not unduly prejudice Duncan or other similarly situated workers. Rather, the \nCourt finds that both parties would benefit from a stay of the present matter in order to gain \npertinent insight that the Supreme Court may offer regarding the HCE exemption. Such insight \nmay narrow the issues presented and streamline discovery . While the Court is aware of Duncan's \npending Motion for Conditional Certification (D.1. 29), Duncan has not identified an instance \nwhere granting a stay will result in the loss of claims due to the expiration of the statute of \nlimitations of the prospective putative class members. \n9. Thus, given the pertinent factors weigh in favor of a stay, XTO's Motion to Stay this \nlitigation pending the Supreme Court's decision in Hewitt is GRANTED. Either party may seek \nleave to lift the stay for good cause shown at an earlier time, if believed necessary and appropriate . \n3 4 GREGORYB. WILLIAMS \nU.S. DISTRICT JUDGE "}
