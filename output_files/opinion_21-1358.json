That, one party says, is enough to make a federal case out of a state -law \ncontract suit. Not so.  State -court interpretation of federal laws is a feature of our \nfederal system , not a bug . And t here is no substantial  issue that could affect  the fed-\neral system . So I remand this case to state court.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nWhen we watch the local news, we do not see the complex contractual web that \nbrings the images to our screens. But here we must  take a closer look.   \nLike most ca ble providers, Spectrum does not generate its own news content. In-\nstead, it pays TV station owners to rebroadcast their content to its viewers. Thus, \nSpectrum contracted with Nexstar to retransmit Nexstar\u2019s  stations. D.I. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 4 \u20135.\u201d  \nAs one of the nation\u2019s largest station owners, Nexstar regularly buys and sells \nstations. So its contract with Spectrum included an \u201cAfter- Acquired Stations \u201d term. \nD.I. 3, at 16; D.I. 2  \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20136. If Nexstar  later  \u201cbec[a]me[] the m ajority owner\u201d or g ot \n\u201cday-to-day managerial authority\u201d of a station, then that station was  covered by the \nparties\u2019 contract. D.I. 3, at 16, 37.  \nSure enough , Nexstar later signed a  contract  with another TV station group \u2014\nMission Broadcasting. That agreement gave Nexstar control over WPIX, a New York \nlocal- news station. D.I. 2 \u00b6  7. \nBelieving that its agreement with Mission gave it \u201cmanagerial authority\u201d over \nWPIX, Nexstar started charging Spectrum fees for rebroadcasting that station . Id. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7. But Spectrum refused to pay up, arguing that WPIX was not  an after -acquired \nstation under the parties\u2019 contract.  \nSo Nexstar sued for breach of contract in Delaware state court.  Spectrum promptly \nremoved to federal court. Now, the parties file competing motions to move this case \nout of this forum. Spectrum asks me to transfer it to  a federal court in New York . D.I. \n11. Nexstar argues  that I lack jurisdiction to hear this case and asks me to send it \nback to Delaware state court. D.I. 17.    \nII. THIS COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER STATE CONTRACT CLAIMS   \nFederal courts may hear only suits  in which the parties hail  from different states \nor cases that raise a federal question. Because t his dispute fits neither category, I will \nsend it back to state court.  \nHere, both Spectrum and Nexstar are Delaware corporations, so I lack diversity \njurisdiction. D.I. 2 -1 \u00b6\u00b6 11\u201312; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1332. Thus, I may hear this case only if \nNexstar\u2019s claim \u201caris[es] under the \u2026 laws \u2026 of the United States.\u201d \u00a7  1331.  \nAs a rule , a case arises under federal law if the complaint pleads a federal cause \nof action. Am. Well Works v. Layne v. Bolwer Co. , 241 U.S. 257, 260 (1916). That is \nnot the case here . Nexstar\u2019s complaint states only a state -law claim for breach of con-\ntract. D.I. 2 -1 \u00b6 10. \nBut there is one narrow exception to the general rule: a state- law claim may im-\nplicate important federal issues that belong in federal court.  Grable & Sons Metal \nProd s., Inc. v. Darue Eng\u2019g & Mfg ., 545 U.S. 308, 310 (2005). This \u201cslim category\u201d is \nlimited to federal issues that are \u201cactually disputed\u201d and vital to the whole federal \nsystem. Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 258 (2013).  4 Spectrum argues that this case fits th at narrow exception. To understand its ar-\ngument, we must plumb the parties\u2019 contract and consider the Federal Communica-\ntion Commission\u2019s role in regulating TV stations.   \nA. This case implicates FCC rules  \nStart with the parties\u2019 contract.  Under it,  Spectrum would have to pay Nexstar  if \nWPIX was an \u201cAfter- Acquired Station .\u201d D.I. 3, at 16. For WPIX to  count, the contract \nsays, Nexstar had to have control over it . And the contract sets forth  a nine -step test \nto determine whether Nexstar had that control . Id. at 37. Step eight of the test re-\nquires \u201cNexstar and [Mission] [to have] \u2026 mutually entered into a valid and binding \n[agreement].\u201d Id. \nSpectrum claims  that Nexstar\u2019s contract with Mission is not a \u201cvalid and binding\u201d \ncontract because it violated the FCC\u2019s rules. D .I. 12, at 3\u2013 4, 17. Those rules bar  a \ncompany from \u201chaving a cognizable interest in television stations which have an ag-\ngregate national audience reach exceeding thirty -nine (39) percent.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 73.3555(e)(1).  \nAccording to Spectrum,  Nexstar exceeded that market cap when it gained control \nof WPIX. Spectrum notes that the FCC required Nexstar to sell off WPIX once before \nto ensure that it fe ll below the national ownership cap. D.I. 12, at 4.  Plus,  it points \nout, the FCC has already been asked  to investigate whether \u201cNexstar has de facto \ncontrol over WPIX\u201d in violation of the rules. Id.  at 5.   \nThus, Spectrum argues , a court cannot decide whether WPIX is an after -acquired \nstation without determining whether the Nexstar -Mission agreement violated FCC \nrules. D.I. 22, at 11. If it did, then it is not a \u201cvalid and binding\u201d contract. Plus, 5 Spectrum says, other steps in the contract\u2019s control test expressly refer to  the FCC \nrules, requiring a court to interpret them . Id. \nThis argument is plausible. By implicating  the FCC\u2019s rules, the parties\u2019 contract \ndispute raises a federal issue. But that alone is not enough. To trigger federal juris-\ndiction, a federal issue must  also be \u201cactually disputed and substantial.\u201d  Grable, 545 \nU.S. at 314 . \nB. Any disputed  federal issue is not substantial enough  \nThis case does not fall within Grable\u2019s limited exception. Though there are sever al \n\u201cactually disputed\u201d federal issues, none is of \u201cimportance \u2026 to the federal system as \na whole.\u201d Gunn, 568 U.S. at 2 60.  \n1. There are disputed federal issues. Nexstar\u2019s state -law claim \u201cnecessarily \nraise[s]\u201d disputed federal issues. Manning v. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith, \nInc., 772 F.3d 158, 163 (3d Cir. 2014), aff \u2019d, 578 U.S. 374 (2016). To decide whether \nNexstar controlled  of WPIX, a court must apply the contractual test. And that test \ndirects a court to interpret the FCC\u2019s rules. Does Nexstar have \u201cthe right to oversee \u2026 [WPIX] programming \u2026 to the extent permitted by FCC Rules\u201d? D.I. 3, at 37 \u00b6  4. \nAnd d id it file its agreement with Mission with the FC C, \u201cif required by FCC Rules\u201d? \nId. at \u00b6 8.  \nPlus, the contract asks whether Nexstar had a \u201cvalid and binding\u201d agreement with \nMission. Id. And Texas law \u2014which governs the Spectrum contract\u2014does not enforce \nillegal agreements. Id.  at 18 \u00b6  18; Peniche v. Aero mexico , 580 S.W.2d 152, 156 (Tex. \nCiv. App. 1979). Thus, if Nexstar contracted with Mission in violation of the FCC\u2019s 6 market- cap regulations, a court could decide that it was not a \u201cvalid\u201d agreement un-\nder the terms of the Spectrum contract.  \n2. Those federal issues are not important enough . But those issues are not im-\nportant enough for this case to fit the narrow Grable exception. To see why, consider \nthe consequences this litigation will have on the federal system. True, to decide \nwhether the  Nexstar -Mission contract was \u201cvalid and binding,\u201d a court might  have to \ndecide if Nexstar exceeded the FCC\u2019s  market cap. But that contract- interpretation \ndecision would determine only Spectrum\u2019s duty to pay for WPIX. It would not dissolve \nNexstar\u2019s contra ct with Mission, change Nexstar\u2019s control of WPIX, or alter Nexstar\u2019s \nmarket share. Those issues are not part of this case  and would be left for the FCC to \ndecide. So Spectrum\u2019s argument that this question would have \u201csystemic impact, be-\ncause the Nexstar -Mission arrangement \u2026 is emblematic of industry -wide behav-\niors,\u201d falls flat. D.I. 22, at 18.  \nThough this dispute matters to the parties, it is not significant for the  federal \nsystem. See Gunn, 568 U.S. at 258\u2013 59. Thus, this case is readily distinguishable from \nthose crucial  federal issues that fall within Grable\u2019s narrow exception. Cf. Grable , 545 \nU.S. at 315 (addressing the ability of the federal government to recover  unpaid  taxes); \nSmith v. Kan . City Title & Tr. Co. , 255 U.S. 180, 199 (1921) (addressing the constitu-\ntionality of federal banks and their bonds).  \n* * * * * \nBecause I lack jurisdiction over this case, I must remand to Delaware state court. \nSee, e.g. , PJM Interconnection, LLC v. Round Rock Energy, LP , 2013 WL 1498668 (D. 7 Del. Apr. 12, 2013). We should not lament that . State courts have always decided \ncases with  federal implications . Martin v. Hunter\u2019s Lessee , 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, \n342 (1816).  \nGiven my  order to  remand,  Spectrum\u2019s motion to transfer this  case is now moot . \nD.I. 11 .
