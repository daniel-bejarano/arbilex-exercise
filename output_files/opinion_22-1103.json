BACKGROUND'\n\nPetitioner is proceeding pro se with a petition for federal habeas relief pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u2018Petition\u2019). (D.1. 3) In January 2010, a Delaware Superior Court jury\nconvicted Petitioner of assault in a detention center. See Roten v. State, 208 A.3d 703\n(Table), 2019 WL 1499908, at *1 (Del. Apr. 3, 2019). On February 19, 2010, the\nSuperior Court sentenced Petitioner as an habitual offender to twenty-five years of\nLevel V incarceration, followed by six months of Level IV work release. See id. The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's conviction and sentence on October 4,\n2010. See Roten v. State, 5 A.3d 631 (Table), 2010 WL 3860663 (Del. Oct. 4, 2010).\n\nOn February 9, 2011, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court his first\n\nmotion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 614\n\n\u2018Petitioner has not provided any documentation concerning his pursuit of relief in the\nDelaware state courts. The Court has constructed the pertinent background information\nby referencing published and unpublished decisions issued by the Superior Court and\nthe Delaware Supreme Court.\n(\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d). See Roten v. State, 69 A.3d 372 (Table), 2013 WL 3206746, at *1\n(Del. June 21, 2013). The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion in July 2011, and\nthe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that judgment on November 8, 2011. See Roten\nv. State, 35 A.3d 419 (Table), 2011 WL 5419684 (Del. Nov. 8, 2011).\n\nThereafter, sometime in January 2012, Petitioner filed a motion for correction of\nillegal sentence and a motion for new trial. See Rofen v. State, No. 262, 2012, Order\n(Del. Nov. 16, 2012). The Superior Court denied both motions. The Delaware Supreme\nCourt affirmed the Superior Court's denial of Petitioner's motion for correction of\nsentence on July 30, 2012. See Roten v. State, 49 A.3d 1194 (Table), 2012 WL\n3096659 (Del. July 30, 2012). The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior\nCourt's denial of Petitioner's motion for new trial on November 16, 2012. See Roten v.\nState, No. 262, 2012, Order (Del. Nov. 16, 2012).\n\nPetitioner filed a motion to reopen his first Rule 61 proceeding, which the\nSuperior Court denied on October 9, 2012. See Roten, 2013 WL 3206746, at *1. The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on June 21, 2013. See id. at *2.\n\nOn July 30, 2013, Petitioner filed a second Rule 61 motion. See State v. Roten,\n2013 WL 7046369, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2013). The Superior Court denied\nthat motion on September 3, 2013. See id. at *2. The Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed that decision on October 28, 2013. See Roten v. State, No. 476, 2013, Order\n(Del. Oct. 28, 2013).\n\nAt some point in 2017, Petitioner filed a request in the Superior Court for a\ncertificate of eligibility to file a petition to modify his habitual offender sentence. See\n\nRoten v. State, No. 441, 2017, Order (Del. Dec. 13, 2017). The Superior Court denied\nthat request on September 22, 2017 and, on December 13, 2017, the Delaware\nSupreme Court dismissed his appeal of that order as untimely. See id.\n\nIn August 2018, Petitioner filed a motion for correction of illegal sentence. See\nRoten, 2019 WL 1499908, at *1. The Superior Court denied that motion, and the\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision on April 3, 2019. See\nid. at *2.\n\nPetitioner filed the instant Petition on August 22, 2022. (D.I. 3) The Petition\nasserts that the Delaware state courts violated his due process rights by sentencing him\nas an habitual offender for his 2010 conviction for assault in a detention center. (D.1. 3\nat 5)\n\nIl. | DISCUSSION\n\nThe Petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. AEDPA imposes a one-year period of limitation on\nthe filing of habeas petitions and effectively precludes petitioners from filing a second or\nsubsequent habeas application except in the most unusual of circumstances. See 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1); United States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644 (3d Cir.\n1999); Mason v. Meyers, 208 F.3d 414 (3d Cir. 2000). AEDPA\u2019s limitation period runs\nfrom the latest of:\n\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for\nseeking such review;\n\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application\ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws\n\nof the United States is removed, if the applicant was\nprevented from filing by such state action;\n\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was\n\ninitially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has\n\nbeen newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made\n\nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or\n\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or\n\nclaims presented could have been discovered through the\n\nexercise of due diligence.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable\ntolling. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may be also excused from failing to comply\nwith the limitations period by making a gateway showing of actual innocence. See\nWallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F. 4 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021).\n\nGiven Petitioner's extensive history of challenging his habitual sentence in the\nDelaware state courts for over a decade, the Court does not discern any facts triggering\nthe application of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B),(C), or (D), Consequently, the one-year period of\nlimitations began to run when Petitioner\u2019s convictions became final under\n\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\n\nUnder \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court judgment but\ndoes not seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes final and the\nstatute of limitations begins to run, upon expiration of the ninety-day time period allowed\nfor seeking certiorari review. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 150 (2012). In this\ncase, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction on October 4, 2010,\n\nand he did not seek review by the United States Supreme Court. As a result, his\n\njudgment of conviction became final on January 3, 2011.2 Applying the one-year\n\nThe ninety-day period actually ended on January 2, 2011, which was a Sunday.\nTherefore, the time to file petition for writ of certiorari extended through the end of the\nday on January 3, 2011. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(1)(C).\n\n4\n\nlimitations period to that date, Petitioner had until December January 3, 2012 to file a\ntimely habeas petition. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64 (3d Cir. 2005) (Fed.\nR, Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period); Phiipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL\n1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period is\ncalculated according to the anniversary method, i.e., the limitations period expires on\n\nthe anniversary of the date it began to run). Petitioner filed the instant Petition on\n\nAugust 19, 2022, more than eleven years after that deadline. Thus, the Court\u2019s\npreliminary screening of the Petition indicates that the Petition is untimely.\n\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling. See\nHolland, 560 U.S. at 645 (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling).\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls AEDPA's\nlimitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, including any\npost-conviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the\nexpiration of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24\n\na\n\n(3d Cir. 2000). A post-conviction motion is \u201cproperly filed\u2019 for statutory tolling purposes\n\nwhen its delivery and acceptance is in compliance with the state\u2019s applicable laws and\nrules governing filings, such as the form of the document, any time limits upon its\ndelivery, the location of the filing, and the requisite filing fee.\u201d Crump v. Phelps, 572 F.\nSup. 2d 480, 483 (D. Del. 2008). The limitations period is also tolled for the time during\n\nwhich an appeal from a post-conviction decision could be filed even if the appeal is not\n\neventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424\n\nThe last post-conviction motion concerning Petitioner's habitual offender\n\nsentence\u2014and therefore, the last possible motion that could trigger statutory tolling\nhere\u2014was the motion for correction of illegal sentence that Petitioner filed in August\n2018. The Superior Court denied the motion, and the Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed that decision on April 3, 2019, which is also the last day for any tolling\nassociated with Petitioner's August 2018 motion for correction of sentence.? Since\nPetitioner filed the instant Petition more than three years after the Delaware Supreme\nCourts April 3, 2019 decision, statutory tolling does not render the Petition timely filed.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the only way for the instant Petition to be deemed\n\ntimely filed is if equitable tolling applies or Petitioner establishes a gateway claim of\nactual innocence. Equitable tolling is only appropriate in rare circumstances when the\npetitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that\nsome extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d Holland,\n560 U.S. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not\navailable where the late filing is due to the petitioner's excusable neglect. /d. at 651-52.\nAs for the extraordinary circumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether\nthe circumstance alleged to be extraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe\n\nan obstacle it creates with respect to meeting AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline.\u201d Pabon v.\n\nMahanoy, 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011). An extraordinary circumstance will only\n\nwarrant equitable tolling if there is \u201ca causal connection, or nexus, between the\n\nextraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner's failure to file a timely federal petition.\u201d\n\n3Although the Court would normaily calculate the amount of statutory tolling related to\neach specific state post-conviction motion, such a labor intensive inquiry is not\nnecessary given the absence of post-conviction filings occurring between the Delaware\nSupreme Court's April 3, 2019 decision and the filing of the instant Petition.\n\n6\nRoss v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013). \u201c[I]f the person seeking equitable\ntolling has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to file after the extraordinary\ncircumstances began, the link of causation between the extraordinary circumstances\nand the failure to file is broken, and the extraordinary circumstances therefore did not\nprevent timely filing.\u201d Brown v. Shannon, 322 F.3d 768, 773 (3d Cir.2003). The burden\nis on the petitioner to prove that he has been reasonably diligent in pursuing his rights.\nSee Urcinoli v. Cathel, 546 F.3d 269, 277 (3d Cir.2008).\nIll. CONCLUSION\n\nPetitioner does not directly address the issue of timeliness. Nevertheless, in the\ninterest of justice, Petitioner shall be given an opportunity to show cause why his\nPetition should not dismissed as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). In his\nresponse to this Memorandum and Order, Petitioner shall state with specificity any facts\nestablishing a credible claim of actual innocence or facts that may entitle him to\nequitable tolling of the statute of limitations, and why his habeas Petition should not be\ndismissed as time-barred. The Court will issue an Order consistent with this\n\nMemorandum.\n\nDated: November 17, 2022 CLA, Z Le 7\n\nColm F.
