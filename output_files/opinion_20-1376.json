BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs initiated this action on October 9, 2020, alleging violation of the \nTelephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227, and its implementing \nregulations , including 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(a)(2) .2 The original complaint was amended \nthree times. 3 \nOn June 3, 2021, Kurt Morales II, Brandon Callier, and Lucas Horton \n1 D.I. 59.

(collectively , \"defendants\").4 Defendants \nfiled the Motion on June 23, 2021 .5 \nDefendants allegedly violated the TCPA by making unsolicited and unauthorized \nphone calls using artificial or prerecorded voice messages , without written consent, to \nsell vehicle service contracts (\"VSCs\").6 \nThe TCPA was enacted to restrict the use of sophisticated telemarketing \nequipment that could make calls to millions of consumers en masse; exactly like those \nallegedly made by defendants .7 Defendants allegedly create lists of thousands of \nvehicle owners from various public records and employ aggressive and illegal sales \ntechniques using artificial or prerecorded voice messages to market their VSCs.8 The \nmessages solicit warranty extensions by purportedly relaying false information \nconcerning the imminent expiration of manufacturers' auto warranties.9 In fact, the \nVSCs are neither actual warranties , nor \"extensions \" of manufacturers' warranties.10 \nDefendants ' allegedly unlawful behavior is documented in numerous prior legal actions \nand consumer complaints to the Better Business Bureau.11 \nPlaintiffs, individually and behalf of Classes of all others similarly situated, seek \n4 0.1. 58. \n5 0.1. 59. \n6 0.1. 58 ,r,r 1-2. \n7 Id. ,r,r 3-4. \n8 Id. ,r,r 15-16. \n9 Id. ,r,r 18-19. \n10 Id. ,r 20. \n11 See, e.g., id. ,r,r 22-24, 26-29. \n2 damages and an injunction that requires defendants stop their purportedly unlawful \ncalling practices. 12 \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. 12(b}(1) \nA court must grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) if it lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction to hear a claim.13 Subject matter jurisdiction must be \naffirmatively shown in the record before considering the merits of any case.14 The party \nasserting federal subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of proving its existence .15 \n\"In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, a court must first determine whether the movant \npresents a facial or factual attack.\"16 \"In reviewing a facial challenge , which contests \nthe sufficiency of the pleadings, the court must only consider the allegations of the \ncomplaint and documents referenced therein and attached thereto, in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff.\"17 Where a statute has been ruled unconstitutional, the court \nlacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider claims arising from the statute.18 Pursuant \n12 Id. ,r7. \n13 In re Schering Plough Corp. lntron/Temodar Consumer Class Action, 678 F.3d \n235, 243 (3d Cir. 2012). \n14 SeeAT&TCommc 'ns of N.J., Inc. v.

DISCUSSION \nThe parties' dispute centers on the interpretation of the United States Supreme \nCourt's decision in Barr v. American Association of Political Consultants , Inc. \n(\"AAPC\").28 The Supreme Court there considered whether a government-debt \nexception to the TCPA violated the First Amendment , and the severability of that \nexception . 29 \nIn 1991, the TCPA was enacted to \"generally prohibit[] robocalls to cell phones \nand home phones.\"30 In 2015 the TCPA was amended to \"allow[] robocalls that are \nmade to collect debts owed to or guaranteed by the Federal Government \" (\"the 2015 \ngovernment-debt exception\").31 The plaintiffs in AAPC, \"political and nonprofit \norganizations that want to make political robocalls to cell phones,\" argued \"the 2015 \ngovernment -debt exception unconstitutionally favors debt-collection speech over \npolitical and other speech\" in violation of the First Amendment , and sought invalidation \nof \"the entire 1991 robocall restriction, rather than simply invalidating the 2015 \n26 Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \n27 Id. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a \ndefendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \nentitlement to relief.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). \n28 140 S. Ct. 2335 (2020). \n29 Id. at 2343 (plurality opinion). \n30 Id. \n31 Id. \n5 government-debt exception .\"32 The Court held \"the 2015 government-debt exception \nadded an unconstitutional exception to the law. We cure that constitutional violation by \ninvalidating the 2015 government-debt exception and severing it from the remainder of \nthe statute.\"33 \nDefendants argue the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims \nbecause as a result of finding the 2015 government-debt exception unconstitutional , \nliability cannot attach to calls made between 2015 and the AAPC decision.34 They \nmaintain the TCPA cannot be applied retroactively , and that retroactive application of \nthe TCPA violates principles of due process.35 Even if the court determines it has \nsubject matter jurisdiction , plaintiffs fail to state a claim because they do not allege \ndefendants used an automatic telephone dialing system (\"auto dialer\" or \"ATOS\") with \nthe capacity to use a random or sequential number generator to either store or produce \nphone numbers to be called.36 \nPlaintiffs argue defendants ' constitutional challenge to the TCPA robocall \n32 Id. \n33 Id. at 2356.

Laches \nLaches is \"generally defined as an unreasonable delay\" resulting in \"material \nprejudice \" to the other party.40 Laches arises where: \"(1) the plaintiff delayed in filing \nsuit for an unreasonable and inexcusable length of time after the plaintiff knew or \nreasonably should have known of its claim against the defendant ; and (2) the defendant \nsuffered material prejudice or injury as a result of the plaintiffs delay.\"41 \nPlaintiffs argue the government-debt exception amendment to the TCPA was \nenacted in 2015, yet defendants delayed until 2020 to assert their constitutional \nchallenge to that exception \"for the sole purpose of avoiding liability for placing \ntelemarketing calls to Plaintiffs in violation of the TCPA.\"42 Plaintiffs assert that delay \nwas unreasonable and materially prejudicial to them.43 \n37 D.I. 61 at 5-6. \n38 Id. at 6-17. \n39 Id. at 17-18 (citing 0.1. 58 ,m 70-88). \n40 Reid v.

Supp. 2d 203, 208 (D. \nDel. 2006) (citation omitted). \n42 0.1. 61 at 5. \n43 Id. \n7 Defendants maintain plaintiffs' argument would require them to seek an \nimpermissible advisory opinion because prior to being sued by plaintiffs they had no \navenue to raise their constitutional challenge.44 Defendants also note Justice Gorsuch's \nstatement suggesting it is questionable whether similarly situated parties would have \nstanding to challenge the constitutionality of the government-debt exception.45 \nThe court determines defendants ' argument is not barred by laches. Defendants \nraised their laches defense in a motion to dismiss the original complaint46 and aver \ndiligence in asserting their defenses through three amendments to that original \ncomplaint.47 Plaintiffs assertions of unreasonable delay and material prejudice have not \nbeen demonstrated and are thus rejected. \nB. Impact of AAPC on the Court's Jurisdiction \nThe FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE require a court dismiss the action if it \ndetermines at any time it lacks subject matter jurisdiction .48 Where a statute has been \nruled unconstitutional , the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider claims \narising from the statute.49 Defendants argue AAPC determined the 2015 government\u00ad\ndebt exception to the TCPA was unconstitutional and severed that exception on a \n44 0.1. 63 at 7. \n45 Id. (citing AAPC, 140 S. Ct. at 2366 (\"The plaintiffs point to the \ngovernment-debt exception only to show that the government lacks a compelling \ninterest in restricting their speech. It isn't even clear the plaintiffs would have standing \nto challenge the government-debt exception. \") (Gorsuch , J. concurring in part, \ndissenting in part)). \n46 See 0.1. 31. \n47 0.1. 63 at 7. \n48 FED. R. CIv. P. 12(h)(3). \n49 See, e.g., Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. at 377; Baucum, 80 F.3d at 540-41. \n8 prospective basis.50 They contend the TCPA cannot be applied retroactively and that \nretroactive application would violate principles of due process.51 Thus, no liability can \narise under the act for defendants' purported violations between 2015 and the issuance \nof the AAPC decision in 2020.52 Because all calls plaintiffs complain of were made \nduring that time period, defendants insist the TAC should be dismissed with prejudice .53 \nThey also argue retrospective application of the TCPA would violate principles of due \nprocess.54 The court disagrees with both arguments. \nThe TCPA was amended in 2015 to carve out an exception for calls related to \ngovernment debt. 55 AAPC held that exception violated the First Amendment because it \ndiscriminated speech based on its content.56 The Court then considered \"whether to \ninvalidate the entire 1991 robocall restriction, or instead to invalidate and sever the \n2015 government-debt exception .\"57 The Court first rejected the argument that the \nentire 1991 robocall restriction was unconstitutional.58 Applying \"ordinary severability \nprinciples \" the Court held the 2015 government -debt exception severable from the \nremainder of the TCPA.59 The Court determined : \n50 D.I. 60 at 8. \n51 Id. at 8-15. \n52 Id. at 7-12. \n53 Id. at 10. \n54 Id. at 12-15. \n55 AAPC, 140 S. Ct. at 2345 (plurality opinion). \n56 Id. at 2345-47 (plurality opinion); 2356-57 (Sotomayor , J., concurring in \njudgment) ; 2363, 2364 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in \npart)). \n57 Id. at 2348 (plurality opinion). \n58 Id. at 2348-49 (plurality opinion). \n59 Id. at 2348-56 (plurality opinion); 2357 (Sotomayor , J., concurring in judgment) ; \n2362-63 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment with respect to severability and dissenting \nin part)). \n9 With the government-debt exception severed, the remainder of the law is \ncapable of functioning independently and thus would be fully operative as \na law. Indeed, the remainder of the robocall restriction did function \nindependently and fully operate as a law for 20-plus years before the \ngovernment-debt exception was added in 2015.60 \nAnalyzing precedent, the Court stated it: \nhas long applied severability principles in cases like this one, where \nCongress added an unconstitutional amendment to a prior law. In those \ncases, the Court has treated the original, pre-amendment statute as the \n\"valid expression of the legislative intent.\" The Court has severed the \n\"exception introduced by amendment,\" so that \"the original law stands \nwithout the amendatory exception .\"61 \n\"[T]he Court in Frost explained that an unconstitutional statutory amendment 'is a nullity' \nand 'void' when enacted, and for that reason has no effect on the original statute.\"62 \nWriting for three justices in the plurality, Justice Kavanaugh stated in footnote 12 that: \nalthough our decision means the end of the government-debt exception , \nno one should be penalized or held liable for making robocalls to collect \ngovernment debt after the effective date of the 2015 government-debt \nexception ... our decision today does not negate the liability of parties \nwho made robocal/s covered by the roboca/1 restriction.63 \n60 Id. at 2353 (plurality opinion). \n61 Id.

Supp. 3d 1242 (M.D. Fla. 2020). With respect \nto Lindenbaum, as discussed below, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court's \nopinion. The district court in Hussain dismissed a suit for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction in a case similar to the matter at bar. Agreeing, at that time, with \nLindenbaum and Creasy, that court held \"federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction \nover alleged violations from the enactment of the 2015 amendment to the July 6, 2020 \ndecision in AAPC.\" Hussain, 506 F.

That cannot have been a remedy.\"73 \nThe Sixth Circuit found the Lindenbaum district court erred in concluding AAPC \n\"offered 'a remedy in the form of eliminating the content-based restriction' from the \nTCPA.\"74 It held the AAPC decision \"recognized only that the Constitution had \n'automatically displace[d]' the government-debt-collector exception from the start, then \ninterpreted what the statute has always meant in its absence.

For instance, \nthe District of Connecticut cogently explained in Pavelka v.

[T]he \nstatutory severance clause makes clear that this type of surgical \ncorrection that leaves unaffected the operation of other provisions of the \nstatute is what Congress wanted. And the equities, including First \nAmendment free speech values, do not command a contrary result. \nRefusing to dismiss the TCPA claim in this case treats [the defendant] no \ndifferently-and suppresses no more speech-than if Congress had not \ncrossed a constitutional line by enacting the government-debt exception in \nthe first place; in either event, the same speech by [the defendant]-its \nrobocalls-would be prohibited. By contrast, dismissing the TCPA claim \nwould flout Congress's intent in enacting the TCPA in 1991 and bestow a \nwindfall on [the defendant]-a set of penalty-free , annoying robocalls \ntouting its services to thousands of Americans-simply because of \nCongress's misstep in adding in 2015 an unconstitutional provision to the \nTCPA that never applied to [the defendant] .89 \nThe court determines , therefore , that application of plaintiffs' TCPA claims to \ndefendants does not violate their due process rights. \nThus, the court recommends defendants ' motion to dismiss based on Rule \n12(b)(1) be dismissed . \nC.
