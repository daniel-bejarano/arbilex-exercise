No. 22-989 (MN) \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n At Wilmington, this 30th day of November  2022; \n Presently before the Court is  a motion to dismiss (D.I. 3) (\u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d) the \nappeal filed by Alfred Giuliano, in his capacity as plan administrator (\u201cthe Plan Administrator\u201d) \nfor the above- captioned  post- plan effective date debtors (\u201cthe Debtors \u201d), from an amended order \nof the Bankruptcy Court, dated July 25, 2022, allowing appellee KeySource Acquisition, LLC \n(\u201cKeySource\u201d)  an administrative expense claim under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(2)  in \nan amount to be determined by later proceeding.  KeySource has moved to dismiss the appeal \npursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8013 on the basis that the amended order is \nnot a final order, as it does not determine the amount of KeySource\u2019s allowed administrative \nclaim,  and this Court  therefore  lacks appellate jurisdiction  to hear the appeal.  For the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court will grant the Motion to D ismiss.  2 I. BACKGROUND \nA. The Original Order and the Amended Order  \nOn April 13, 2022, KeySource filed a motion for allowance of an administrative expense \nclaim  pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(2)  in connection with certain  products \npurchased by KeySource  from the Debtors which were later  recalled  (Bankr. D.I. 622)1 (\u201cthe \nAdministrative Expense Motion\u201d).  The Debtors objected to the Administrative E xpense Motion \n(Bankr. D.I. 632), and KeySource  filed its reply in further support (Bankr. D.I. 639).  O n \nJune 17, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Administrative Expense M otion.  \n(See Bankr. D.I. 793 (\u201c6/17/22 Tr.\u201d)).  At th e hearing, the Bankruptcy Court advised  that it \nwould grant the Administrative Expense Motion solely with respect to  the issue of liability while  \ndefer ring its  ruling on the amount of the claim to a later date, explaining that \u201cwe are not \nnecessarily calcul ating a particular amount here, but that the primary purpose of our colloquy \ntoday was to determine whether or not . . . KeySource . . . is entitled to an administrative claim.\u201d  \n(6/17/22 Tr. at 187:25-188: 3).  On  June 22, 2022, however, the Bankruptcy Court entered an \norder (Bankr. D.I. 797) ( \u201cthe Original Order\u201d)  that KeySour ce \u201cis allowed an  administrative \nexpense claim in the amount of $237,446.40 for the Recalled Product.\u201d  ( See D.I. 1 , Ex. A ).   \nOn July 7, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing to consider confirmation of the \nDebtors\u2019 Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of VJGJ, Inc. and Its Debtor Affiliates (\u201cthe \nConfirmation Hearing\u201d).  ( See Bankr. D.I. 823 (\u201c7/7/22 Tr.\u201d)).  As discussed at the Confirmation \nHearing, the Debtors, their prepetition lenders, and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors believed that the Original Order fixing an amount of KeySource\u2019s administrative expense was entered in error and believed that the June 17 hearing did not  \u2013 and was not \n \n1   The docket of the Chapter 11 cases, captioned In re VJGJ, Inc., Case No. 21-11332 \n(BLS) (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \u201cBankr. D.I. __.\u201d 3 intended to \u2013 address the amount of any allowed administrative expense of KeySource.  (7/7/22 \nTr. at 32:2-23; 37:7-25; 45:17-46:1).   On July 25, 2022, at the Debtors\u2019 request, and consistent \nwith the Bankruptcy C ourt\u2019s comments on the record at the June 17 hearing, the Bankruptcy \nCourt entered an order amending the Original Order (Bankr. D.I. 837) (\u201cthe Amended Order\u201d) \nallowing  KeySource \u2019s administrative expense claim \u201cin an amo unt to be determined .\u201d  (D.I. 1, \nEx. B (emphasis added)).   \nB. The Notice of Appeal and Motion to Dismiss \nTwo days after entry of the Amended Order, on July 27, 2022, the Plan Administrator \nfiled this appeal  from the Original Order, amended by the Amended Order.  ( See id. at 1).   On \nAugust 5, 2022, KeySource filed its Motion to Dismiss the appeal.   \nOn August 11, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued  a letter addressing the Amended Order \nand offering a further hearing to the parties to fix the amount of KeySource \u2019s administrative \nexpense claim  (Bankr. D.I. 853) (\u201cthe Letter\u201d) .  The Letter does not refer to the  pending appeal \nof the Original Order and Amended Order .  (See id .)  As KeySource correctly asserts, t he \nBankruptcy Court is unable at this time to fix the amount of KeySource\u2019s administrative expense claim because the Plan Administrator\u2019s a ppeal of the Amended Order has divested the \nBankruptcy Court of jurisdiction over the matter .  See In re Transtexas Gas Corp., 303 F.3d 571, \n578-79 (5th Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is a fundamental tenet of federal civil procedure that  \u2013 subject to \ncertain, defined exceptions  \u2013 the filing of a notice of appeal  from the final judgment of a trial \ncourt divests the trial court of jurisdiction and confers jurisdiction upon the appellate court.\u201d). \nThe Motion to Dismiss is fully briefed.  (D.I. 3, 5, 6).  The Court did not hear oral \nargument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.  4 II. JURISDICTION \nAppeals from the Bankruptcy Court to this Court are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158.  \nPursuant to \u00a7 158(a), district courts have mandatory jurisdiction to hear appeals \u201cfrom final \njudgments, orders, and decrees\u201d and discretionary jurisdiction over appeals \u201cfrom other interlocutory orders and decrees.\u201d  28 U.S.C \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3).   \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nKeySource moves for the dismissal of the appeal of the Amended Order, which \nsupersedes the Original Order, on the basis that  this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction .  \nKeySource argues that the Amended Order does not fix t he amount of the allowed administrative \nclaim  and is not a final order .  (See D.I. 3 at 2-3).  The Plan Administrator argues that  the \nAmended Order should be  construed as a  final order under the Third Circuit\u2019s flexible approach \nto the determination of finality of orders entered  in the bankruptcy context.  ( See D.I. 5 at 3- 5).2 \nIn the context of claims litigation, an order finally settling the amount and priority of a \ncreditor\u2019s claim is appealable.  Howard Delivery Serv. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 547 U.S. 651, 657 n.3 (2006) (\u201c[I]n particular, [Congress] has long provided that orders finally settling creditors\u2019 claims are separately appealable.\u201d); see also In re Morse Elec. Co., 805 F.2d 262, 264 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, J.) (\u201cA disposition of a creditor \u2019s claim in a bankruptcy is \u2018final\u2019 for \npurposes of \u00a7 158(d) when the claim has been accepted and valued, even though the court has not yet established how much of the claim can be paid given other, unresolved claims.\u201d) ; White \nBeauty , 841 F.2d at 526 (\u201cNor is an order final when it upholds liability, but does not fix the \namount of damages).  In this case, the Amended Order does not \u201c finally settl[e ]\u201d KeySource\u2019s \n \n2  Indeed, in the bankruptcy context, this Court should be pragmatic in its interpretation of \nfinality because of the uniquely protracted nature of the proceedings and the many parties with different claims.  See e.g., F/S Airlease II, Inc. v. Simon, 844 F.2d  99, 103- 04 (3d \nCir. 1988); In re White Beauty View, Inc. , 841 F.2d 524, 526 (3d Cir. 1988). 5 administrative expense claim because the Amended Order does not set an amount for the claim, \nbut rather states that the amount is \u201cto be determined.\u201d  \nThe Plan Admi nistrator  argues that an order establishing merely the priority for a claim \nand not the amount can be appealed as a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1).  As support, he cites In re Marcal Paper Mills, Inc ., 650 F.3d 311 (3d Cir. 2011) , a case in which the bankruptcy \ncourt denied a multiemployer pension fund\u2019s request to accord administrative expense status to  \nthe post -petition portion of a withdrawal liability claim.  A t the time of the appeal in Marcal , the \nPlan Administrator argues, the amount of withdrawal liability claim had not been liquidated to apportion the claim amounts attributable to pre - and post -petition amounts.  ( See D.I. 5 at  4 \n(citing Marcal , 650 F.3d at 314) ).  But in that case, the claimant filed a claim for the entire \n$5,890,128 withdrawal liability as an administrative expense claim.  650 F.3d at 313.  The bankruptcy court\u2019s order \u201creclassified the entire withdrawal liability claim as a general secured claim. \u201d  Id. at 314.  Therefore, the order from which the claimant appealed in Marcal had fixed \nboth the priority and the amount of the claim.  \nThe Plan Administrator further argues t hat the three factors considered by the Third \nCircuit in determining the existence of appellate jurisdiction  weigh in favor of a determination of \nfinality : (1) the impact of the matter on the assets of the bankruptcy estate; (2) the preclusive \neffect of a decision on the merits; and (3) whether the interests of judicial economy will be furthered.  (D.I. 5 at 4- 5 (citing Marcal , 650 F.3d at  314)).  With respect to the first factor , the \nPlan Administrator argues that the allowance of KeySource\u2019s  administrative claim \u201cwould likely \nrepresent nearly 10% of the available assets for distribution to unsecured creditors, which is \nabout $2,400,000.\u201d   (D.I. 5 at 5).   With respect to the second factor , the Plan Administrator \nasserts that allowance of KeySource\u2019s claim under the Amended Order \u201ccould have a preclusive 6 \neffect on the Post -Effective Date Debtors\u201d and the assets of their estates as it  may lead to the \nassertion  and allowance of similar  claims .  With respect to the third factor , the Plan \nAdministrator argues that, by granting the Motion to Dismiss, \u201cthe parties will need to participate \nin at least two different proceedings: one at the bankruptcy court level to determine the amount of the claim, and one in this Court to determine the proper[] priority of the claim.\u201d  (D.I. 5 at 16).   \nThe Plan A dministrator\u2019s  arguments are unavailing.  As the Third Circuit has noted, \n\u201c[o]ur jurisdiction is properly invoked by balancing a general reluctance to expand traditional interpretations regarding fina lity and a desire to effectuate a practical termination of the matter \nbefore us.\u201d  In re Meyertech Corp ., 831 F.2d 410, 414 (3d Cir. 1987).  Resolution of an  appeal \nregarding the claim \u2019s priority  will not obviate the need for further action by the Bankruptcy \nCour t, as the claim \u2019s amount must still be determined .  On the other hand, i f this Court grants the \nMotion to Dismiss , the Bankruptcy Court may  proceed to fix the amount of the claim.  Then, if a \nparty wishes to appeal at that point , all issues with respect to the allowed claim can be put before \nthis Court in one  appeal .  Judicial economy therefore weighs against a finding of finality and in \nfavor of dismiss al.  See Meyertech , 831 F.2d at 414. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThe Amended Order  is not a final order, and consideration of the relevant factors under \nthe Third Circuit \u2019s pragmatic approach does not otherwise support a determination of  finality .  \nTHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 3) is GRANTED \nand the appeal is  DISMISSED .  The Clerk of the Court is directed to close  this case.  \n \n       \n      The Honorable Maryellen Noreika \n      United States District Judge  "}
