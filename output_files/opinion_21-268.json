Acthar Plaintiffs challenge the sufficiency of Arnold & Porter\u2019s  \ndisclosures, as well as  the nunc pro tunc  nature of the relief, arguing that a recent Supreme Court \ndecision  \u2013 Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan v. Acevedo Feliciano, 140 S. Ct. 696 (2020) \n(per curiam)  \u2013 overruled Third Circuit precedent giving bankruptcy courts discretion to grant \nsuch relief.   For the reasons that follow, the Court will affirm the Retention  Order . \nII. BACKGROUND\nPrior to the chapter 11 cases, Debtors engaged Arnold & Porter for legal representation\nthat included FDA regulatory and healthcare compliance, antitrust counseling, and antitrust, shareholder derivative, and other litigation.  (APP349-50, 41)  Since 2019, Arnold & Porter has been counsel to Debtors on cases relating to the distribution, pricing, and marketing of Acthar\u00ae Gel, including litigation initiated by Acthar Plaintiffs.  (APP349-50, 415)  On October 12, 2020 (\u201cPetition Date\u201d), Debtors filed their  chapter 11 petitions in the Bankruptcy Court. \nA. Ordinary Course Professionals Motion\nTwo days after the P etition D ate, on October 14, 2020, Debtors filed a motion (APP1 -38) \n(\u201cOCP Motion\u201d) seeking authorization to retain certain ordinary course professionals (\u201cOCPs\u201d), including Arnold & Porter.  ( APP28 )  The OCP Motion set forth the reasons the se professionals \nwere essential for Debtors to continue their normal business activities and further their c hapter \n11 ca ses.  ( APP12 )  The OCP Motion asserted  that failure to retain the OCPs would severely \nhinder Debtors\u2019 efforts, as there was a significant risk that OCPs would be unwilling to provide services or would suspend services without a court order authorizing retention.  ( APP12 )  \nAccordingly, Debtors sought authorization to retain the OCPs nunc pro tunc  to the Pe tition D ate \n(i.e., two days before the OCP Motion was filed) for professionals who had been engaged prepetition , like Arnold & Porter.  ( APP7 )  The OCP Motion proposed a retention procedure \nunder which each OCP was required to submit a \u201cDeclaration of Disi nterestedness\u201d certifying 3 \n that the OCP \u201cdoes not represent or hold any interest adverse to the Debtors or their estates with \nrespect to the matter(s) on which the professional is to be employed.\u201d  ( APP6 -7; see also APP35 -\n38 (form Declaration of Disinterest edness attached to the OCP Motion) )  The OCP Motion also \nincluded payment caps.  For Arnold & Porter, and subject to exceptions not relevant here, \u201csuch fees and expenses . . . [could] not exceed an average of $150,000 per month over a rolling three -\nmonth period.\u201d  ( APP8 -9)  Incurred fees and expenses could be paid \u201cwithout formal \napplication\u201d and would be memorialized in periodic payment summaries filed with the \nBankruptcy Court.  ( Id.; APP23- 24)  The OCP Motion and proposed order recognized the \npossibility of payments \u201cbec om[ing] subject to court approval\u201d \u201cif such payments exceed the \nCap Amounts.\u201d  ( APP9; APP24 -25)  In the OCP Motion, Debtors noted that \u201c[a]lthough the \nautomatic stay and other issues in these cases may decrease the Debtors\u2019 need for the services of \ncertain  Ordinary Course Professionals, the Debtors cannot now quantify or qualify their needs.\u201d   \n(APP4 )  Acthar Plaintiffs did not file any objections to the OCP Motion.  \nB. Ordinary Course Professionals Order \nOn November 10, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Order (APP100- 08) (\u201cOCP  \nOrder\u201d),  which provided for retention nunc pro tunc  to the P etition D ate and gave each OCP that \nhad already commenced postpetition services for Debtors 30 days to file the required declaration.  (APP102)  In compliance with the OCP Order, Arnold & Porter promptly filed a declaration by \npartner Michael B. Bernstein  on November 25, 2020.  ( APP133- 36)  Bernstein specified that the \nservices the firm would provide were \u201c(1) litigation services relating to antitrust, shareholder derivative, and other claims regarding Acthar; (2) antitrust counseling related to distribution and pricing; and (3) FDA regulatory and healthcare compliance counseling.\u201d  (APP135)    Bernstein \nfurther declared that no \u201cprincipal, partner, director or officer of, or professional employed by, the Firm . . . holds or represents any interest adverse to the Debt ors or their estates with respect 4 to the matter(s) upon which the Firm is to be employed\u201d and stated that while the firm may \nperform services for \u201cpersons that are parties in interest in these chapter 11 cases,\u201d Arnold & Porter \u201cdoes not perform services for any such person in connection with these chapter 11 cases with respect to the matter(s) upon which the Firm is to be retained.\u201d  (APP134-35)  Bernstein  \ndisclosed that \u201cDebtors owe the Firm $16,024.31\u201d in outstanding prepetition fees and expenses and recognized that payment of this  debt was \u201csubject to the limitations contained in the \nBankruptcy Code\u201d and that \u201cthe Firm may be required to waive\u201d those fees.  (APP135-36) \nOn December 3, 2020, Acthar Plaintiffs filed an Omnibus Objection to Retention of \n\u201cOrd inary Course Professionals\u201d by Debtors.  (APP137-72)  Acthar Plaintiffs did not challenge \nthe nunc pro tunc  aspect of the relief .  Rather, Acthar Plaintiffs  argued (among other things) that \nretaining the OCPs would not \u201cbenefit . . . the estate\u201d because the OCPs\u2019 \u201cservices are not needed at this time ,\u201d due to the fact that \u201clitigation pending against the Debtors is stayed.\u201d  \n(APP139-41)  Acthar Plaintiffs als o argued that the OCPs were not retained \u201cin the \u2018ordinary \ncourse\u2019 of their business\u201d and had not filed adequate disclosures.  (APP145-57)  Acthar Plaintiffs later filed a Second Omnibus Objection, raising substantially the same arguments.  (APP189-207) The Bankruptcy Court scheduled a hearing on the objections for February 25, 2021.(B.D.I. 1382 at 3) \nC. Section 327(e) Special Counsel Application\nPrior to the hearing on the pending objections to the OCP Order, Debtors filed an \napplication to employ and retain Arnold & Porter as s pecial counsel to the Debtors nunc pro tunc \nto the Petition Date .  (APP327-418) (\u201cApplication\u201d)  Section 327(e) allows a debtor to see k court  \napproval to retain special counsel when doing so would be in the best interest of the estate, the attorney previously represented the debtor, and the attorney does not hold any interest \u201cadverse to the debtor or to the estate with respect to the matter on which such attorney is to be 5 \n employed.\u201d  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(e).  The Application explained that , due to new developments in \nthe c hapter 11 cases, Arnold & Porter  would regularly incur fees and expenses in excess of the \npayment cap established in the OCP Order.  ( APP330- 32)  Among the reasons given for this \nlikelihood was the \u201c[a]ctive litigating by the Acthar Plaintiffs of myriad issues in these chapter \n11 cases\u201d including \u201cthe filing of numerous motions.\u201d  ( APP454- 55)    \nDebtors argued that Arnold & Porter was well qualified to serve as special counsel under \n\u00a7 327(e) and that retention would be in the best interest of the  Debtors\u2019 estates, creditors, and \nother par ties in interest.  ( APP332)   The Application identified the interruption and duplicative \ncost that would result if Debtors had to obtain substitute counsel.  ( APP331- 32)  Debtors argued \nnunc pro tunc  relief was appropriate, citing the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s pr ior grant of  nunc pro tunc  \nrelief under the OCP Order and the fact that the Application was filed because of developments beyond Debtors\u2019 control that would require Arnold & Porter to incur fees and expenses in excess of the fee cap.  (APP338)  \nIn support, Debtors attached another declaration from Bernstein.  ( APP347- 412)  As to \nthe $16,026.31 that Debtors owed Arnold & Porter as of the petition date for unpaid prepetition services, Bernstein \u201cconfirm[ed] that A&P will be waiving this prepetition  amount in its \nentirety.\u201d  ( APP353)   The declaration  stated that Bernstein  \u201cdo[es] not believe there is any \nconnection or interest . . . between A&P and (i) the U.S. Trustee or any person employed by the U.S. Trustee\u201d or \u201c(ii) any counsel, accountants, fin ancial consultants and investment bankers \nwho represent or may represent claimants or other parties in interest in the Debtors\u2019 chapter 11 cases, except as otherwise described herein.\u201d  ( APP353)   The declaration n oted that \u201cA&P \nappears in cases, proceeding s and transactions involving many different attorneys [and other \nadvisors], some of which now or may in the future represent claimants and parties in interest in the Debtors\u2019 chapter 11 cases,\u201d \u201cA&P has not represented and will not represent any such 6 \n entities in relation to the Debtors and their chapter 11 cases, nor does A&P have any relationship \nwith any such entities that would be adverse to the Debtors or their estates in the matters upon \nwhich A&P is to be employed in these cases.\u201d  ( Id.)  The declarat ion detailed the procedures the  \nfirm had followed to identify connections and potential conflicts and attached extensive \nschedules , listing the interested parties that Arnold & Porter had searched in its conflict database \nand the entities from that schedule the firm represented in the last five years.  ( APP351- 52; \nAPP358- 89 (Sch. 1 \u2013 Potential Parties in Interest); APP390 -405 (Sch. 2 \u2013 Current Clients); \nAPP406- 12 (Sch. 3 \u2013 Former Clients) )  The declaration also disclosed  the firm\u2019s rates and \ncompensation arrangement with Debtors.  ( APP354- 57)  It further stated: \u201c[f]or the 90 days prior \nto the Petition Date, A&P received payments in th e total amount of $3,609,155.43 in connection \nwith the Debtors\u2019 prepetition billing arrangement with A&P.\u201d  ( APP356)       \nDebtors also attached a declaration from Stephen A. Welch, the Chief Transformation \nOfficer of Mallinckrodt plc.  ( APP413- 18)  Welch explained that Debtors first engaged Arnold & \nPorter in March 2018, in relation to the A cthar litigation, other litigation, and FDA regulatory \nand compliance matters.  ( APP415)   Welch  explained that Arnold & Porter was \u201cwell -qualified \nand uniquely situated to represent the Debtors as special counsel related to regulatory, antitrust and litigation matters in these chapter 11 cases in an efficient  and effective manner\u201d and that \nArnold & Porter \u201chas gained significant knowledge regarding the Debtors\u2019 business a nd the \nmatters with respect to which the Debtors are seeking to retain A&P.\u201d  ( APP415- 16)  Welch \nconfirmed that \u201cthe Debtors and Arnold & Porter determined that A&P regularly will incur fees and expenses in excess of the [payment cap]\u201d and that, \u201c[b]ased on this determination, the Debtors concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Debtors \u2019 estates, creditors, and \nother parties in interest to retain A&P pursuant to the Application.\u201d  ( APP415 -16)  Arnold & \nPorter subsequently filed additional disclosures, including a February 8, 2021 s upplemental 7 declaration from Bernstein.  (APP442-446; APP 438-41) \nActhar Plaintiffs filed objection s challeng ing the form and adequacy of the disclosures.  \nThey further argued that nunc pro tunc  relief was not warranted under Third Circuit precedent .  \nFinally, in a footnote , they asserted  that Arnold & Porter\u2019s $16,026.31 claim for prepetition fees \nand expenses constituted a conflict.  (APP419-31) \nD. Hearing and Retention Under \u00a7 327(e)\nOn February 11, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Application to retain \nArnold & Porter under \u00a7 327(e).  (APP463-543)  Welch and Bernstein were  cross -examined  by \nActhar Plaintiffs.  ( APP483 -519 (Welch); APP520-41 (Bernstein))  Bernstein explained that the \nApplication was filed because of \u201cthe rate cap\u201d and \u201cthe fact  that . . . the level of work was going \nto be more, given sort of what the debtor had seen in the bankruptcy action of what issues would \ncome up and where they would need our expertise to support them on the influx of the Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d  ( APP5 23)  Welch testified to the same effect.  (APP513-14) \nAt a hearing the following day (APP544-85), counsel delivered closing arguments, and \nDebtors reiterated that Acthar Plaintiffs were the reason why Debtors needed continued advice from Arnold & Porter to  such an extent that it justified retention as special counsel under  \n\u00a7 327(e).  (APP553)  For the first time, Acthar Plaintiffs raised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision inRoman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan v. Acevedo Feliciano, 140 S. Ct. 696 (2020) (per curiam).  (APP574-75)  Although counsel for Acthar Plaintiffs acknowledged that Acevedo  \n\u201cgoes to jurisdiction,\u201d conceded that \u201cnunc pro tunc . . . has been the custom and practice in this \njurisdiction for a long time,\u201d and admi tted that he  had himself \u201cfiled thousands, probably \nhundreds of motions at least nunc pro tunc throughout the course of my  career,\u201d Acthar Plaintiffs \nargued that the Supreme Court had now overruled that established precedent and practice.  (APP559, 574)    8 In its bench ruling granting the Application, the Bankruptcy Court held that Debtors had \nsatisfied all of \u00a7 327(e)\u2019s requirements.  The Bankruptcy Court found that Arnold & Porter had \n\u201crepresented the debtor previously.\u201d  (APP581)  The Bankruptcy Court further found, \u201cbased on the evidence that was presented during the [February 11] hearing,\u201d that \u201cit is in the best interest of the estate to allow Arnold & Porter to give advice to the debtors on . . . [the] issues that they\u2019re being retained for,\u201d including issues related to the Acthar litigation, which \u201cArnold & Porter was involved intimately in . . . prepetition\u201d and which \u201chave become prominent in this case and will continue to be prominent.\u201d  (APP581-82)  T he Bankruptcy Court also found, \n\u201cagain, based on the record, that there is no adverse interest that Arnold & Porter holds that relates to the matter for which they are being employed.\u201d  (APP582)  Finally, the Bankruptcy Court held that nunc pro tunc  relief was warranted.  (APP582-83)  The Bankruptcy Court \nrejected the Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Acevedo , holding that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \nwas \u201climited in its scope\u201d and dealt with use of \u201ca nunc pro tunc order to create jurisdiction where jurisdiction did not previously exist.\u201d  ( Id.)  On February 16, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court \nentered the Retention Order , granting the Application.  (APP459-62) \nE. Appeal\nActhar Plaintiffs  timely appealed  the Retention Order .  (D.I. 1)  The merits of the appeal \nare fully briefed.  (D.I. 9, 12, 14)  No party requested oral argument.  The Court did not hear oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument. III. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\nAppeals from the Bankruptcy Court to this Court are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158.\nPursuant to \u00a7 158(a), district courts have mandatory jurisdiction to hear appeals \u201cfr om final \njudgments, orders, and decrees.\u201d  A bankruptcy court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in approving 9 \n . . . retention under the standards of section 327 in light of the specific facts and circumstances of \nthe case.\u201d  Century Indem. Co. v. Boy Scouts of Am. (In re Boy Scouts of Am.) , 2021 WL \n1820574, at *5 (D. Del. May 6, 2021).  A bankruptcy court\u2019s decisi on on a \u00a7 327(e) application \n\u201cis reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d  Phila. Newspapers, LLC v. Off. Comm. of Unsecured Creditors , 408 B.R. 585, 596- 97 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (citing Staiano v. Pillowtex, Inc. (In re \nPillowtex, Inc.) , 304 F.3d 246, 250 (3d Cir. 2002)).  \u201cAn abuse of discretion exists where the . . . \ncourt\u2019s decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an \nimproper application of law to fact.\u201d  Id . at 597 ( internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201cA decision \nto grant nunc pro tunc  approval is in the discretion of the bankruptcy court, and is reviewed for \nabuse of discretion only.\u201d  F/S Airlease II, Inc. v. Simon, 844 F.2d 99, 103 (3d Cir. 1988) \n(citation omitted).  IV.   DISCUSSION  \nA. The Application Satisfied the  Requirements of Section 327(e)  \nTo approve the appointment of special counsel under section 327(e) , the Bankruptcy \nCourt was required to  find that: \u201c(1) the representation is in the best interest of the estate, (2) the \nattorney represented the debtor in the past, (3) the attorney is for a specific purpose approved by the court, other than to represent the debtor in conducting the case, [and] (4) the attorney does not represent or hold an interest adverse to the debtor or the debtor\u2019s estate\u201d with respect to the matter on which the attorney is to be employed.  Stapleton v. Woodworkers Warehouse, Inc. (In re Woodworkers Warehouse, Inc.) , 323 B.R. 403, 406 (D. Del. 2005); see  also  11 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 327(e).  \nActhar Plaintiffs make no  argument as to the first three  requirements of the statute, and \nthe Bankruptcy Court correctly found they were satisfied here.  \u201c[B]ased on the evidence that was presented during the [February 11] hearing,\u201d the Bankruptcy C ourt found that retaining 10 Arnold & Porter was \u201cin the best interest of the estate\u201d and that Arnold & Porter had \n\u201crepresented the debtor previously.\u201d  (APP581)  Additionally, the specific purpose and task s for \nwhich Arnold & Porter was being retained were clearly delineated, and were separate and not duplicative of the services performed by general bankruptcy counsel.  (APP332-33, APP 336; \nAPP350-51)  These findings find  ampl e support in  the record .   \nActhar Plaintiffs \u2019 arguments touch only on the fourth \u201ca dverse interest\u201d requirement  of \n\u00a7 327(e).  The  Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings in this regard were also  supported by the record ,\nincluding the Bernstein and Welch declarations.   The Bernstein declaration presented unrebutted \nevidence that there was no \u201cconnection or interest . . . between A&P\u201d and \u201cthe U.S. Trustee or any person employed by the U.S. Trustee\u201d or claimants\u2019 or other parties in interest\u2019s \u201ccounsel, accountants, finan cial consultants and investment bankers.\u201d  (APP353)  Bernstein declared that \n\u201cA&P has not represented and will not represent any \u201d attorneys, counsel, accountants, financial \nconsultants and investment bankers, who now or may in the future represent claimants and parties in interest \u201cin relation to the Debtors and their chapter 11 cases,\u201d and that Arnold & Porter does not \u201chave any relationship with any such entities that would be adverse to the Debtors or their estates in the matters upon which A&P is to be employed in these cases.\u201d  ( Id.)  \nThe Bernstein declaration further  detailed the procedures his firm had followed to identify \npotential conflicts .  (APP351-52; APP358-89; APP390-405; APP406-12)  These disclosures are \nunrebutted by any evidence cited by Acthar Plaintiffs.   \nActhar Plaintiffs argue that Arnold & Porter failed to disclose certain required \ninformation, which left the Bankruptcy Court unable to properly assess whether there was any \u201cconflict of interest\u201d that would be \u201cdisqualifying\u201d under \u00a7 327(e).  ( See D.I. 9 at 31-34; id. at  2, \nStatement of the Issues 3(i))  Acthar Plaintiffs focus on two specific items: (i) a \u201cStatement of Work\u201d signed in July 2020, and (ii) the \u201ccompensation paid within the 90 days prior to the 11 \n Petition Date for services provided pre -Petition date and to be provided post -Petition Date.\u201d  ( Id. \nat 31- 32)  However,  Acthar Plaintiffs later admit that all of this information was in fact \ndisclosed.  ( Id. at 3 4) (noting disclosure of all information prior to or at February 11, 2021 \nhearing )  The  Statement of Work was disclosed before the February 11, 2021 hearing on the  \n\u00a7 327(e) Application, and  Acthar Plaintiffs extensively cross -examined Welch and Bernstein \nabout that  document at the hearing.  (See APP502- 09, 512- 13, 518- 19, 528- 31)  The Application \nalso attached the Bernstein declaration , which disclosed the amount Arnold & Porter had \nreceived in the 90 days prior to the petition date.  ( APP335, APP 356) \nIndeed, it is unclear what asserted disclosure violation Acthar Plaintiffs are raising on \nappeal  other than an asserted delay in making the disclosures .  Acthar Plaintiffs \u2019 opening brief  \nincludes a litany  of cases involving disclosure issues, but those cases are inapposite.  ( See D.I. 9 \nat 32-34)  As Debtors correctly point out, m ost relate to a true failure to disclose, not a situation \n(like here) where all  disclos ures were made before the approval decision.3  The only cases cited \nthat considered  a delay in disclosure are distinguishable  from the se facts .4   \n \n3 See NNN 400, 619 B.R. at 813; DeAngelis v.

Apr. 12, 2006), involved  late \n\u201cdisclosures [that] still obfuscate the facts. \u201d \n 12 As Debtors correctly point out, all but two of the cases cited by Acthar Plaintiffs involve \nstatutory provisions other than \u00a7 327(e).  Most of the cases cited in the opening brief involved  \n\u00a7 327(a), which has a broader, more exacting conflict-of-interest standard than appointment ofspecial counsel under \u00a7 327(e) and, accordingly, different disclosure requirements.  See, e.g., DeVlieg -Bullard, Inc. v. Nat ale (In re DeVlieg, Inc.) , 174 B.R. 497, 503 (N.D. Ill. 1994) \n(\u201c[S]ection 327(e) does not require that counsel be a \u2018disinterested person,\u2019 as section 327(a) does . . . .\u201d); Phila. Newspapers, LLC, 408 B.R. at 597 n.14 (\u201cBecause the appointments of general counsel and special counsel are governed by separate Bankruptcy Code provisions, cases interpreting the appointment of general counsel under \u00a7 327(a) are inapplicable to an analysis of the appointment of special counsel under \u00a7 327(e).\u201d).   \nActhar Plaintiff s cite only two cases addressing  \u00a7 327(e).  In those cases, the bankruptcy \ncourt found that the undisclosed information revealed a disqualifying adverse interest.  See  In re \nNNN 400 Cap. Ctr. 16, LLC , 619 B.R. 802, 814-15 (Bankr. D. Del. 2020) (firm failed to disclose \nfee-sharing arrangement with undisclosed third- party that created \u201ca pecuniary interest adverse \nto the Debtors\u201d); Molten Metal , 289 B.R. at 508-09, 512 (firm failed to disclose prepet ition \nconfidentiality agreement with debtor that created \u201ca disqualifying adverse interest\u201d).   No similar \nfacts are present here.   Fundamentally, Acthar Plaintiffs cite no case for the proposition that a \nprofessional may be disqualified because of (at most) a slightly delayed disclosure of information that provides more detail about a connection that had already been disclosed.   \nActhar Plaintiffs argue that including Arnold & Porter in the initial OCP Motion was \u201can \nattempted end run around the disclosure requirements under Section 327(e).\u201d  (D.I. 9 at 30; id . at \n2, Statement of the Issues 3(ii))  This  theory is contradicted , however, by the unrebut ted evidence \nin the record .  Debtors included Arnold & Porter in the OCP Motion and only reversed course \nwhen they realized that Arnold & Porter would exceed the payment caps set in the OCP Order as 13 \n a result  of new developments : namely, Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 aggressive tactics in the bankruptcy \nproceedings.  (APP415; APP454- 55; APP512- 14, 523; APP553)5  The Bankruptcy Court \ncredited this explanation  \u2013 a finding that is not clearly erroneous .  (APP581 -82)  Acthar \nPlaintiffs \u2019 speculat ion that Debtors were somehow attempting to avoid the  disclosure \nrequirements are devoid of record support.   \nFinally, Acthar Plaintiffs argue that \u201cArnold & Porter held an interest adverse to the \nestate based on the preference payments received and a Pillowte x analysis should have been \nconducted.  None was conducted and Arnold & Porter should have been disqualified.\u201d  (D.I. 9 at \n35-36; id . at 2  (Statement of the Issues 4 ))  The Court  concludes, instead, that Pillowtex  does not \napply here.6  Pillowtex  is a \u00a7 327(a) case about the \u201cdisinterested\u201d requirement that finds no \nanalogue in \u00a7 327(e).  Moreover, the respective \u201cadverse interest\u201d requirements in the two \nsections differ.  As courts have recognized, having claims against the estate for unpaid prepe tition professional fees does not amount to an \u201cinterest adverse to the debtor or to the estate \nwith respect to the matter on which such attorney is to be employed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 327(e).  See, e.g., DeVlieg, Inc., 174 B.R. at 503 (\u201c[S]ection 327(e) . . . permit[s] counsel to have claims for prior fees.\u201d); In re Potter , 2009 WL 2922850, at *1 (Bankr. D.N.M. June 12, 2009) (\u201cA pre -\npetition claim for unpaid professional fees arising from proposed special counsel\u2019s pre -petition \nrepresentation of the Debtor does not disqualify such counsel from representing the trustee under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(e).\u201d); In re EBW Laser, Inc ., 333 B.R. 351, 359 & n.3 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2005) \n(same); In  re Henlar, Ltd., 1997 WL 4567 at *1, 3 -4 (E.D. La. Jan. 6, 1997) (same).    \n \n5 Whether Arnold & Porter was ever \u201can ordinary course professional\u201d (D.I. 9 at 31) has nothing \nto do with whether the Bankruptcy Court properly approved its retention under \u00a7 327(e).  \n \n6 Accordingly, the Court need not consider Debtors\u2019 additional argument that the Acthar \nPlaintiffs  waived the  Pillowtex  argument .  (See APP419- 31) 14 \n As the Debtor correctly points out, the same holds  true with respect to prepetition \npayments.  Such claims or payments are relevant to whether general counsel has an interest \nadverse \u201cto the estate\u201d for \u00a7 327(a) purposes but, without more, are not relevant to whether \nspecial counsel has a qualifying adverse interest \u201cwith respect to the matter on which such \nattorney is to be employed\u201d for \u00a7 327(e) purposes.  See DeVlieg , 174 B.R. at 503 (explaining \ndifferent adverse interest requirements).  Indeed, prepetition  claims or payments are expected for \nspecial counsel , as one statutory requirement is that counsel have previously represented the \ndebtor.  See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(e).   \nFull disclosure was  made  prior to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s entry of the Retention Order, \nand Acthar Plaintiffs have failed to identify any cognizable \u201cadverse interest .\u201d  Accordingly, t he \nCourt finds no error in th e Bankruptcy Court \u2019s finding \u201cthat there is no adverse interest that \nArnold & Porter holds that relates to the matter for which they are being employed.\u201d  ( APP582)   \nB. Nunc Pro Tunc  Relief Was Not an Abuse of Discretion  \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs  challenge the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to approve the retention \nnunc pro tunc  to the Petition Date.  Under controlling Third Circuit law, \u201cbankruptcy courts have \nthe power to authorize retroactive employment of counsel and other professionals under their broad equity power . . . [w]here equitable concerns weigh in favor of granting retroactive  \napproval to enable deserving professionals to recover compensation for work actually done.\u201d   In \nre Arkansas Co ., 798 F.2d 645, 650 (3d Cir. 1986).  \u201c[R]etroactive approval\u201d may be granted if \n\u201cprior approval would have been appropriate\u201d and \u201cthe delay in seeking approval was due to hardship beyond the professional\u2019s control.\u201d  Id . at 650; see also  F/S Airlease II, Inc. v. Simon, \n844 F.2d 99, 105 (3d Ci r. 1988).  S uch \u201cretroactive approval\u201d is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  \nArkansas Co., 798 F.2d at 650. 15 \n  The default rule for bankruptcy courts in Delaware is that retention is effective \u201cas of the \ndate the m otion was filed.\u201d  Del. Bankr. L.R. 2014 -1(b).  B ankruptcy courts routinely authorize \nretroactive approval to the bankruptcy petition date ,7 and district courts and courts of appeals  \nroutinely affirm such approvals under an abuse of discretion standard.8  Moreover, t he Office of \nthe U.S. Trustee\u2019s long- held position is that it will \u201cnot ordinarily object\u201d if \u201cretention \napplications\u201d for \u201cprofessionals\u201d are \u201cfiled within 30 days of the petition date.\u201d  In re United \nCos. Fin. Corp., 241 B.R. 521, 526 (Bankr. D. Del. 1999).  Hence, as counsel for Acthar \nPlaintiffs has admitted below, nunc pro tunc  relief \u201chas been the custom and practice in this \njurisdiction for a long time.\u201d  (APP 574) \nThe Bankruptcy Court was well within its discretion in following the  established case law \nand finding retroactive approval appropriate here.  There was no delay in seeking approval of  \nArnold & Porter as counsel.  Debtors filed an application just  two days after filing the \nbankruptcy petition.  ( APP1 -38)  The OCP Motion requested and the OCP Order granted nunc \npro tunc  relief  (APP7; APP104 ), and no party objected to that aspect of the OCP Order.  B oth the \nOCP Motion and the OCP Order contemplated t he possibility that the payments to Arnold & \nPorter would be \u201csubject to court approval\u201d if they consistently exceeded the OCP payment caps.  \n(APP24 -25; APP106)   As the Debtors point out, t hat possibility became a reality with respect to \nArnold & Porter when the Acthar Plaintiffs chose to actively litigate \u201cmyriad issues,\u201d including \nby \u201cfiling of numerous motions\u201d in the bankruptcy proceeding (and, to date,  numerous  appeals ).  \n(APP454- 55, APP581- 82)  When Debtors re alized that the payment  caps would routinely be \nexceeded, they promptly filed the \u00a7 327(e) Application.  ( APP327- 418)  Because these \n \n7 See, e.g., In re Art Van Furniture, LLC , 617 B.R. 509, 520 (Bankr. D. Del. 2020) . \n \n8 See, e.g., Boy Scouts of Am ., 2021 WL 1820574, at *6- 8; Woodworkers Warehouse , 323 B.R. at \n405. 16 \n circumstances were \u201cbeyond the professional\u2019s control,\u201d Arkansas Co., 798 F.2d at 650, t he \nBankruptcy Court was well within its discretion in following established case law and finding \nretroactive approval appropriat e. \nC. The Supreme Court\u2019s Recent Decision  \nDoes Not Overrule Third Circuit Precedent  \n \nActhar Plaintiffs  argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Acevedo  effectively \noverruled Third Circuit precedent and now categorically precludes  bankruptcy courts from \nretroactively approving the retention of professionals.  The Court disagrees. \nAs the Debtors correctly note,  Acevedo  did not consider  any issues of  bankruptcy law.  In \nthat case, t he Archdiocese of San Juan asked the Supreme Court t o grant review to decide \n\u201c[w]hether the First Amendment empowers courts to override the chosen legal structure of a \nreligious organization and declare all of its constituent parts a single legal entity subject to joint and several liability.\u201d  2019 WL 261628, *i (Jan. 14, 2019) (petition for certiorari) .  The \ncertiorari petition made no mention of nunc pro tunc  relief; neither did the brief in opposition or \nthe reply.  See id .; 2019 WL 461568 (Feb. 1, 2019)  (brief in opposition) ; 2019 WL 1080897 \n(Mar. 6, 2019) (reply brief) . \nThe Supreme Court then invited  the Solicitor General  to file a brief expressing the views \nof the United States , 139 S. Ct. 2765 ( June 24, 2019), and that  brief identified  a potential \njurisdictional defect, see 2019 WL 6715369, *18- 19 (Dec. 9, 2019).  The Solicitor General \nexplained that the injunction that was the subject of the certiorari petition had been entered by the Puerto Rico court at a time when the case had \u201cbeen removed to federal court,\u201d after one of the parties had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, \u201cand had not yet been remanded,\u201d even though the bankruptcy case had been dismissed.  Id . at *4, 17.  W hile the \u201cfederal district court\u2019s remand \norder\u201d had purported to apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to the dismissal date, there r emained a \u201csubstantial 17 \n question whether\u201d its \u201cattempt to make its remand order retroactive could cure the defect in the \njurisdiction of the\u201d Puerto Rico court.  Id . at *18- 19 (citation omitted).  In e xplaining this  \njurisdictional defect, the Solicitor General noted the Supreme Court had previously stated that \n\u201cfederal courts have the power to enter \u2018 nunc pro tunc \u2019 orders only to ensure that the record \n\u2018reflect[s] the reality\u2019 of what occurred  \u2013 not to \u2018make the record what it is not\u2019 or to \u2018make it \nappear that it took an action which it never took.\u2019\u201d  Id . at *18 (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins , 495 \nU.S. 33, 49 (1990)).  S upplemental brief ing in response to the amicus brief  included no \nsubstantive discussion of the nunc pro tunc  issue .  See 2019 WL 7212350 (Dec. 20, 2019) \n(supplemental brief for respondents) ; 2019 WL 7212349 (Dec. 23, 2019) (supplemental brief for \npetitioners) .   \nBased on  the jurisdictional defect, t he Supreme Court vacated the Puerto Rico decision .  \nSee Acevedo , 140 S. Ct. at 697, 701.  The Supreme Court explained that the removal to federal \ncourt had stripped the Puerto Rico court of jurisdiction, and the orders on appeal had been issued \nbefore the federal court remanded the case.  See i d. at 700.  The Supreme Court agreed with the \nSolicitor General  that calling the remand order \u201c nunc pro tunc \u201d could not create jurisdiction \nwhere none in fact existed.  See i d.  A s the Supreme Court further explaine d, \u201c[f]ederal courts \nmay issue nunc pro tunc orders, or \u2018now for then\u2019 orders, . . . to  \u2018reflect . . . the reality\u2019 of what \nhas already occurred  . . . .  \u2018Such a decree presupposes a decree allowed, or ordered, but not \nentered,  through inadvertence of the court.\u2019  . . . .  Put colorfully, \u2018[n]unc pro tunc orders are not \nsome Orwellian vehicle for revisionist  history \u2013 creating \u2018facts\u2019 that never occurred in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id . \nat 700- 01 (citations omitted).  Based on th is language,  Acthar Plaintiffs assert  that the Supreme \nCourt has suddenly declared that bankruptcy courts have no authority to retroactively approve \nretention of professionals .  The Court is not persuaded.  18 \n The Court agrees , instead,  with the Bankruptcy Court that Acevedo \u2019s limited discussion \nof nunc pro tunc  orders is specific to jurisdiction.  ( See APP582 ( Acevedo  inapplicable where \nrelief \u201cis not creating jurisdiction in this court\u201d); APP582 -83 (Acevedo  is \u201climited in its scope\u201d \nand dealt with use of \u201ca nunc pro tunc  order to create jurisdiction where jurisdiction did not \npreviously exist\u201d) )  The defect in Acevedo  was jurisdictional, and the Solicitor General\u2019s \ndiscussion (which the Supreme Court adopted) was limited to jurisdiction.  The three cases the \nSupreme C ourt cited likewise involved jurisdiction.9  Consistent with this view , the Third Circuit \nhas recognized the same \u201cwell -established rule that jurisdictional prerequisites cannot be \ncircumvented by equitable considerations\u201d and a lower court thus may not \u201c bas[e] its finding of \njurisdiction on the grant of nunc pro tunc  relief.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Gonzales , 125 F. App\u2019x 406, 412 -\n13 (3d Cir. 2005).  Other  courts , too, have understood Acevedo  as simply reiterating the well-\nunderstood distinction between a court \u201ccreat[ing] jurisdiction where none exists\u201d and granting \nretroactive relief on equitable grounds when the court indisputably has jurisdiction to act.  See Merriman v. Fattorini (In re M erriman) , 616 B.R. 381, 391 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2020) ; see also, e.g., \nIn re Hunanyan, 2021 WL 2389273, at *2 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. June 10, 2021) (\u201c Acevedo  does not \nchange the existing authority of the court to approve  employment that has commenced before the \nmotion was brought.\u201d); In re SS Body Armor I, Inc., 2021 WL 2315177, at *3 (Bankr. D. Del. June 7, 2021) (\u201c Acevedo  does not prohibit courts from entering nunc pro tunc  orders where there \n \n9 See Missouri , 495 U.S. at 49 (finding that nunc pro tunc  order did \u201creflect[] the reality of the \naction\u201d in context of triggering 90- day jurisdictional deadline for filing petition for certiorari); \nCuebas y Arredondo v. Cuebas y Arredondo, 223 U.S. 376, 389 (1912) (court could not \u201center a \ndecree as of a day before [party\u2019s] death\u201d in order \u201cto confer jurisdiction against [decedent] as a sole defendant\u201d); United States v. Gillespie , 666 F. Supp. 1137, 1139 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (indictment \nthat was void as \u201chaving been the product of a grand jury acting without legal  authority\u201d because \nstatutory term had expired could not be made valid by nunc pro tunc  order).  19 \n are no jurisdictional defect s.\u201d).  The  Acevedo  decision does not effect the drastic change in law \nthe Acthar Plaintiffs contend. \nAs the Third Circuit explained in Gutierrez , nunc pro tunc \u201callows a court sitting in \nequity to deem an action to have been taken as of a time when it should have been taken, but was \nnot due to circumstances not attributable to the laches of the parties.\u201d  125 F. App\u2019x at 411 n.7 (citing Mitchell v. Overman , 103 U .S. 62, 65 (1881)).  \u201cA court may generally grant nunc pro \ntunc relief \u2018as justice may require, in view of the circumstances of the particular case.\u2019\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Mitchell, 103 U.S. at 65).  The  Court agrees that the  type of nunc pro tunc  relief at issue  \nhere falls comfortably within those traditional, equitable confines.  \nThe Court disagrees with the Acthar Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that, after Acevedo , bankruptcy \ncourts have refused to approve retention of professionals \u201cto obtain retroactive effect.\u201d  (D.I. 9 a t \n8)  Of the 13 cases cited by Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 in their lengthy string cite, only three involved the \napproval of professionals.  Wh ile those cases disagreed with the use of \u201cnunc pro tunc \u201d orders \nafter Acevedo , none held that Acevedo  precludes retroactive compensation.\n10 \n \n10 In In re Benitez , the district court recognized that \u201c\u2018 [n]unc pro tunc retentions\u2019 are common \npractice in bankruptcy matters largely resulting from the statut ory framework for compensation \nof estate professionals set forth in sections 327 and 330,\u201d as \u201cthe delay between commencement \nof services to the estate, the filing of a motion for court approval and the entry of the order approving the retention may take s everal weeks.\u201d  2020 WL 1272258, at *1 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. \nMar. 13, 2020).  Far from  barring compensation for pre -approval work, that court held that \u201c nunc \npro tunc  or retroactive retention is not necessary\u201d because \u201cthere is no per se  prohibition, in the \nstatute or precedential caselaw, against awarding reasonable compensation to an estate \nprofessional for actual and necessary services rendered to the estate prior to the date of court approval of retention.\u201d  Id . at *5 (holding that bankruptcy court may \u201cawar d[] reasonable \ncompensation to an estate professional for actual and necessary services rendered to the estate prior to the date of court approval of retention\u201d).  The Court in In re Roberts  reached the same \nconclusion.  618 B.R. 213 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 2020).  The court there explained that, although \u201cthe use of nunc pro tunc  orders to retroactively seek employment of professionals is an \nimproper use of the mechanism,\u201d that \u201cdoes not mean that services rendered prior to entry of an order authorizing the employment will be uncompensated,\u201d since \u201capplicable bankruptcy statutes and rules laying the foundations for employment and compensation do not require employment \nto be authorized prior to performance of services.\u201d  Id . at 217.  Similarly, the court in  In re 20 The Honorable Mary F. Walrath has similarly distinguished  Aceved o, noting: \u201c There are \nmany instances in bankruptcy . . . not only [Bankruptcy] Rule 6003, but many instances where \nbecause of  the notice requirements the Court is unable to enter an order on no notice and will \nallow any re lief to be nunc pro tunc  to the filing of the retention application.\u201d  ( APP717 ( In re \nHertz Corp ., No. 20-11218 (Bankr. D. Del.), 12/28/20 Hr\u2019g Tr.  at 61:11-15))  Indeed, w ith \nrespect to \u00a7 327(e) in particular, retroactive compensation is not only permissible \u2013 it is practically required.  \u201cT he concept of retroactive compensation is incorporated into the Federal \nRules of Bankruptcy Procedure,\u201d including \u201cBankruptcy Rule 6003(a), [under which] an application for employment may not be approved within the first 21 days of a bankruptcy case, absent a need to avoid immediate and irreparable harm.\u201d  In re Miller , 620 B.R. 637, 642 (Bankr. \nE.D. Cal. 2020); see also  Del. Bankr. L.R. 2014- 1(b) (req uiring \u201cat least twenty -one (21) days\u2019\nnotice\u201d before hearing on retention motion).  \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 expansive reading of Acevedo  as a categorical bar on any \nretroactive approval of professional services under \u00a7 327(e) is in substantial tension with Bankruptcy Rule 6003.  See M iller, 620 B.R. at 642-43 (\u201cNothing in Acevedo  suggests the \nSupreme Court intended to undermine the vitality of Bankruptcy Rule 6003(a).\u201d). V. CONCLUSION\nThere is no error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding that  the Application met the\nrequirements of \u00a7 327(e), and the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in granting retroactive compensation in connection with Arnold & Porter\u2019s retention .  For the foregoing \nreasons, the Retention Order  will be  affirmed .  An appropriate Order follows. \nGrinding Specialists, LLC  approved employment of counsel and made such employment \n\u201ceffective as of the date the request to employ was presented to, and could have been acted on, \nby the Court.\u201d  625 B.R. 6, 15 (Bankr.
