Pro\nSe Plaintiffs.\n\nNovember |'{ , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nain\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. District Judge:\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiffs D\u2019 Andre R. Rogers, Evan T. Dayton, Jerry McGinnis, Jason A.\nKashner, and La\u2019Teef Dickerson (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), all inmates at Sussex Correctional\nInstitution (\u201cSCI\u201d), filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.! (D.I. 2) They\nappear pro se and have been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. Rogers\nhas filed a request for counsel (D.I. 5) This Court proceeds to screen the\nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \u00a7 1915A(a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs are housed at SCI. Rogers authored the Complaint and was the\nonly person who signed the original complaint. (D.I.3) Later, in compliance with\nthe Court\u2019s June 21, 2022 Order, the other Plaintiffs submitted signed copies of the\nComplaint. (D.L. 31, 32, 33, 34)\n\nRogers has a lung condition. (D.I. 3 at 8) He alleges that the showers inside\nSCI\u2019s Medium Building have had continuous mold problems since August 3, 2020.\n(Id. at 6) In July 2020, Rogers asked for bleach to clean the showers, and\nDefendant Sgt. Rodney Hudson refused his request. (/d.) Rogers did not know the\n\ncause of his shortness of breath and, around June 2021, he fainted and had an\n\n' Inmate Darnell Seeney was dismissed as a plaintiff. (See D.I. 43)\n\n1\nasthma attack. (Id.) The prison power-washed and painted the shower. (/d.)\nRogers informed the American Correctional Association about the mold problem\nand in August/September 2021, ACA personnel came to SCI and were met by\nDefendants Captain Niblett, Hudson, and Lt. Bates who said it \u201cwas nothing\u201d.\n(Id.) Rogers suffered another asthma attack in December 2021, took some mold\nsamples, and sent them to OSHA for testing and the results came back as black\nmold. (d.)\n\nIn the meantime, Rogers submitted several grievances. During a grievance\nhearing in January 2022, Bates threatened Rogers with lying about the mold. (Jd.\nat 7) The grievance was upheld by all three boards. (/d.) Rogers alleges\nretaliation by Niblett, Maans, Bates, and Hudson who wrote Rogers up for being\nunable to work in the kitchen.? (Id. at 9)\n\nRogers alleges that, as a result of his grievances, Defendant Warden Mears\ninformed him that he hired an outside contractor to take care of the showers. (/d.)\nRogers later found out that there were no outside contractors. (/d.) In January/\nFebruary, an inmate worker sprayed the showers and floors with an orange solution\n\nand was to follow that with power washing in March 2022 - but he did not. (/d.)\n\n2 The Court cannot discern from this allegation who actually wrote up Rogers.\n2\nRogers, who is on a lung transplant list, alleges that his lungs have been\nweakened by the refusal of Mears, Maans, Bates, Niblett, Wise, Hudson, and Beck\nto do anything about the mold/black mold conditions in the Medium Building\nshower area. (Id. at 8) Rogers alleges that Defendant Clayton Morgan is aware of\nthe problem. (Id.)\n\nRogers seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action swa sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is\nfrivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or\nseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\nforma pauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks\nwsditdhs from a governmental defendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions\nbrought with respect to prison conditions). The Court must accept all factual\nallegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro\nse plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiffs proceed pro se,\n\ntheir pleading is liberally construed and their Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully\npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by\nlawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. Apr. 27, 2020) (quoting Neitzke\nvy. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard\nused when deciding Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions. See\nTourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)).\nHowever, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint\nunless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State\nHosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nUSS. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly and Iqbal, a court\n\nreviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the\nelements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of\ntruth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their\nveracity and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\nSee Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016); see also\nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is\nplausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw\non its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Jd.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Failure to State a Claim\n\nDayton, McGinnis, Kashner, and Dickerson are named as Plaintiffs in the\ncaption of the Complaint. They are not mentioned in the Complaint and there are\nno allegations they were harmed by any action or inaction by Defendants.\n\nTo prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must show that a person (or\npersons), acting under color of law, deprived him of a constitutional right. Parratt\nv. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981), overruled on other grounds by Daniels v.\nWilliams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986); Thomas v. Tice, 943 F.3d 145, 149 (3d Cir. 2019).\nThe foregoing Plaintiffs do not state any claims against any named defendant.\n\nThey will be dismissed from the action and will be given leave to amend.\nB. Conditions of Confinement\n\nRogers alleges that Mears, Maans, Bates, Niblett, Wise, Hudson, and Beck\ndeliberately refused to do anything about the mold/black mold conditions in the\nMedium Building shower area causing Rogers physical harm. (D.I. 3 at 8) The\nEighth Athnatiient \u201cprohibits any punishment which violates civilized standards\nand concepts of humanity and decency.\u201d Young v. Quinlan, 960 F.2d 351, 359 (3d\nCir. 1992), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Nyhuis v. Reno, 204\nF.3d 65, 71 n.7 (3d Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).\n\nTo prevail against prison officials on a claim that an inmate\u2019s conditions of\nconfinement violated the Eighth Amendment, the inmate must meet two\nrequirements: (1) the deprivation alleged must be, objectively, sufficiently\nserious,\u201d and (2) the \u201cprison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of\nmind.\u201d Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834, (1994) (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted). The first element is satisfied when an inmate is deprived of\n\u201cthe minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d Wilson v. Seiter, 501 US.\n294, 299 (1991). The second element is satisfied when an inmate shows that prison\nofficials acted with deliberate indifference to the inmate\u2019s health or safety or\nconditions of confinement that violated the inmate\u2019s constitutional rights. Id. at\n\n302-03.\nWhen considering whether conditions of confinement violated the Eighth\nAmendment, courts recognize that \u201cthe Constitution does not mandate comfortable\nprisons, and prisons . . . which house persons convicted of serious crimes, cannot\nbe free of discomfort.\u201d Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 349 (1981). \u201cTo the\nextent that such conditions are restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the\npenalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.\u201d Id. at 347.\n\nThe Complaint adequately alleges conditions of confinement claims against\nMears, Niblett, Bates, and Hudson. As to Beck, Wise, Maans, and Morgan, the\nclaims against them are plead in a conclusory manner without factual support of\ntheir actual knowledge of the mold/black condition. The conditions of\nconfinement claims against Beck, Wise, Maans, and Morgan will be dismissed.\nPlaintiffs will be given leave to amend the claim the conditions of confinement\nclaims.\n\nC. Retaliation\n\nRogers alleges retaliation by Niblett, Maans, Bates, and Hudson. In order to\nestablish a retaliation claim a plaintiff must allege that: (1) his conduct was\nconstitutionally protected; (2) he suffered an adverse action at the hands of prison\n\nofficials; and (3) his constitutionally protected activity was a substantial or\nmotivating factor in the decision to discipline him. See Watson v. Rozum, 834 F.3d\n417, 420 Gd Cir. 2016).\n\nRogers alleges that he submitted a grievance and Bates, who held the\nhearing, threatened to write-up Rogers for lying about the mold. Rogers prevailed\non his grievance. The Complaint fails to state a retaliation claim against Bates.\nWhile Rogers engaged in a constitutionally protected act, there are no allegations\nthat he suffered an witv\u00e9hae action as a result of doing so. Bates may have threated\nto write-up Rogers, but there are no allegations that he did.\n\nNor does the Complaint state retaliation claims against Niblett, Maans, and\nHudson. The Complaint alleges their retaliation in a conclusory manner without\nany supporting facts. Nothing supports the retaliation claim.\n\nThe retaliation claims will be dismissed for failure to state claims upon\nwhich relief can be granted. Plaintiffs will be given leave to amend.\n\nD. Request for Counsel\n\nThe Court will grant Rogers\u2019 request for counsel. (D.I. 5)\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Rogers\u2019 request for counsel\n\n(D.I. 5); (2) dismiss Plaintiffs Evan T. Dayton, Jerry, McGinnis, Jason A. Kashner,\n\nand La\u2019Teef Dickerson, and all claims raised against Defendants by Rogers except\n\n9\nthe conditions of confinement claims raised against Defendants Warden Truman\nMears, Captain Joshua Niblett, Lieutenant Kevin Bates, and Sergeant Rodney\nHudson, as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)() and (ii) and 1915A(b)(1). Plaintiffs\nwill be given leave to file an amended complaint.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n10\n"}
