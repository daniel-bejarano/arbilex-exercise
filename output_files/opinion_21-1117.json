The Court, having reviewed Defendant Netgear, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cDefendant\u201d) motions \n(the \u201cMotions\u201d) to stay pending inter partes  review (\u201cIPR\u201d) , (D.I. 83 in Civil Action No. 21-\n1117- MN-CJB; D.I. 85 in Civil Action No. 21-1120- MN-CJB), the briefing related thereto, and \nhaving considered the three stay- related factors, hereby ORDERS that the Motions are \nGRANTED for the reasons that follow.   \n2. The first \u201csimplification of issues\u201d factor decidedly favors a stay.  In both of the \ntwo cases at issue here, all of the asserted claims of the one patent -in-suit will be under review \nby the United States Patent and Trademark Office \u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board \n(\u201cPTAB \u201d).  But even more than that, in its institution decisions, the PTAB noted that it was 2 \n reasonably likely that each asserted claim was invalid in light of at least two (and in one case \nthree) different invalidity arguments.  (D.I. 84 at 3 & e x. 1 in Civil Action No. 21- 1117- MN-\nCJB; D.I. 86 at 3 & ex. 1 in Civil Action No. 21- 1120- MN-CJB)  Thus, there seems to be a very \nmeaningful chance that the PTAB will ultimately find many  or all of the asserted claims at issue \nin these cases to be invalid.   If that happens, then any further work done on the cases in the \nmeantime will be wasted (and if it does not, there will still be simplification gains, in that, inter alia, Defendant\u2019s invalidity case s will have been significantly pared down).   Moreover, absent \nsomething very unusual happening, ( see D.I. 93 at 2- 3 in Civil Action No. 21- 1117- MN-CJB; \nD.I. 92 at 2- 3 in Civil Action No. 21- 1120- MN-CJB), the PTAB will be issuing its Final Written \nDecisions (\u201cFWD\u201d) in October 2023\u2014just a month or two before the  scheduled trial date in \nDecember 2023.   Were the cases not stayed, the timing of the PTAB\u2019s decisions would unduly \ncomplicate proceedings  here, since the District Court and the parties  would have to process the \ncontent of the FWDs (and what they mean for the trial) with only just weeks to go before trial \nbegins. \n3. With regard to the second \u201cstatus of the litigation\u201d factor, it is a mixed bag, as at \nthe time the Motions were filed, these cases were just a bit short of their halfway mark.   As such, \nthe cases are surely not in their early stages ( since by the time of the Motions\u2019 filing, document \ndiscovery was well underway and a Markman hearing had just been held).  But on the other \nhand, there is still a ways to go before trial (i.e., no Markman opinion has yet issued, fact discovery will not end until February 2023, only one deposition had been taken, and summary judgement and trial are still to come), and the Court has not yet done an outsized amount of work on these matters.   While judges might differ  as to how this second factor should come out in light \nof such  facts, compare CallWave Commc\u2019ns, LLC v. AT&T Mobility, LLC , Civil Action No. 12-3 \n 1701- RGA, 2015 WL 1284203, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 18, 2015) , with TruePosition, Inc. v. Polaris \nWireless, Inc. , C.A . No. 12- 646-RGA/MPT, 2013 WL 5701529, at *4 (D. Del. Oct. 21, 2013), in \nthe Court\u2019s view, the factor is about neutral.  \n4. As for the third \u201cundue prejudice\u201d factor, it favors a stay.  To be sure, if the cases \nare stayed and the PTAB does not declare all o f the asserted claims invalid, then Plaintiff   \nWSOU Investments, LLC d/b/a Brazos Licensing and Development (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) will have been \ndelayed in seeking relief for alleged infringement.  But the potential for such delay does not, on \nits own, amount to undue prejudice.  See  Ever Win Int\u2019l Corp. v. Radio Shack Corp., 902 F. \nSupp. 2d 503, 509 (D. Del. 2012).  Moreover, the parties are not direct competitors, and so if the PTAB does not invalidate all asserted claims, then any intervening delay should not prejudice Plaintiff\u2019s ability to obtain full relief for infring ement via a monetary damage award.   And \ncontrary to Plaintiff\u2019s argument, the record does not show  that Defendant caused it prejudice by \nunduly delaying the filing of its  IPR petitions.   While the petitions were filed in February 2022, \nclose to the one -year statutory deadline, the Court does not view that fact as being problematic \nper se \u2014since accused infringers often understandably want to have a good handle on what the \nscope of the district court litigation will be before they file an IPR petition.  Here,  it is not as if \nDefendant filed its petitions many months after having seen Plaintiff\u2019s initial claim charts and after having filed its own initial invalidity contentions.   Cf. Int\u2019l Test Sols., Inc. v. Mipox Int\u2019l \nCorp., Case No. 16- cv-00791- RS, 2017 WL 1316549, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 10, 2017); Freeny v. \nApple Inc., CASE NO. 2:13- cv-00361- WCB, 2014 WL 3611948, at *2 (E.D. Tex. July 22, \n2014).  To the contrary, the petitions were filed right around the time that Plaintiff served its initial claim charts  in these cases , and well before Defendant\u2019s initial invalidity contentions were 4 \n due.  (D.I. 17 at 4, D.I. 40 & D.I. 93 at 6 in Civil Action No. 21-1117- MN-CJB; D.I. 16 at 4, D.I. \n39 & D.I. 92 at 6 in Civil Action No. 21-1120- MN-CJB)  \n5. With two of the stay factors clearly favoring Defendant\u2019s position and one \nroughly neutral, it is clear that these cases should be stayed n ow, before they get into their later \nstages , in order to allow the PTAB\u2019s efforts to  streamline the parties\u2019 disputes .   \n6. Therefore, the Court ORDERS that the cases are STAYED pending the issuance \nof a FWD in each of the respective IPR proceedings.   No later than seven days after the last of \nthe FWDs issues, the parties shall file with the Court a joint letter, of no more than three single-\nspaced pages, providing an update on the FWDs and the parties\u2019 positions as to whether the cases should remained stayed.   In the interval, the Clerk of the Court is directed to \nADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSE th e cases. \n Dated:  November 30, 2022   ____________________________________ \n      Christopher J.
