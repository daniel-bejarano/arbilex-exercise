AUGUST , et al., \nDefendants. : Civil Action No. 21-911-RGA \nCameron C. McCary, Howard R. Young Correctional Institution , Wilmington , Delaware. \nPro Se Plaintiff. \nJanuary Ll , 2022 \nWilmingto h, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Cameron C. McCary, an inmate at Howard R. Young Correctional \nInstitution in Wilmington , Delaware , filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. \n2). Plaintiff appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. \n(D.I. 8). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a) . \nBACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin . Servs., Inc., 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff alleges deliberate indifference to serious mental \nhealth needs in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments . (D.I. 2 at 6). On \nMay 13, 2020, Plaintiff was examined by Defendant Dr. August who prescribed the \n\"most powerful\" mental health medication the prison had. (/d.). Plaintiff alleges that on \nAugust 11, 2020, Defendant Jane Doe falsely reported that Plaintiff was suspected of \n\"checking/hoarding\" medication. (Id. at 6-7). Dr. August ordered the discontinuation of \nthe medication without examining Plaintiff. (Id. at 7). \nPlaintiff submitted a grievance and was advised by Defendant Nakiya Lesene of \nthe policy that medication is discontinued when alleged hoarding of medication is \nreported. (Id. at 7). Lesene would not help Plaintiff get the medication reinstated , she \nwould not give him any more monthly check-ups , and she banned him from mental \nhealth for nearly nine months. (/d.). Plaintiff appealed the decision. (/d.). Plaintiff met \n1 with Defendant MGC Panel and Defendant Lt. R. Hosten-Jones (who conducted the \nhearing) and was informed of the policy to discontinue all medication when hoarding is \nalleged because security concerns outweigh medical needs; the Panel determined that \nDr. August was correct in his decision to discontinue the medication . (Id. at 8). Plaintiff \nappealed to Defendant Mike Records. Plaintiff alleges Defendant MHM/Centurion knew \nof his complaints , knew about the policy practice, and failed to train its employees on \nhow to handle schizophrenic inmates. (Id.). Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive \ndamages. (Id. at 8). \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or \nmalicious , fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary \nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds prose, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nAmended Complaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent \n2 standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at \n94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends ' on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless \" or \n\"fantastic or delusional\" factual scenario.\"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscherv. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. \n1999). However , before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions. \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted. See id. at 11. \n3 A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations , assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane \nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\" Id. \nDISCUSSION \nDefendant Grievance Panel/Mental Health Staff will be dismissed . To state a \nviable \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege facts showing a deprivation of a constitutional \nright, privilege or immunity by a person acting under color of state law. See Daniels v. \nWilliams, 474 U.S. 327, 330 (1986). The Grievance Panel/Mental Health Staff is not a \nperson as is required to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. As to the remaining Defendants , \nPlaintiff has alleged what appear to be cognizable and non-frivolous medical needs \nclaims. \n4 CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss Defendant Grievance \nPanel/Mental Health Staff pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(8)(i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1 ); \nand (2) allow Plaintiff to proceed against the remaining Defendants . \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n5 "}
