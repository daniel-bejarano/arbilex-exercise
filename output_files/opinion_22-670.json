Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nSeptember Ab, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n7 \u201cWing\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPlaintiff David Q. Webb commenced this action on May 23, 2022. (D.I. 2)\nHe appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I.\n5) The Amended Complaint is the operative pleading. (DI. 6). Pending is\nPlaintiff's request for electronic notification. (D.I. 4) The Court proceeds to\nreview and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b).\n\nIL. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d\nCir. 2008). The claims concern Defendant Bank of America Corporation\u2019s check\ncashing fee for non-payroll paychecks. (D.I. 6 at 4)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendant Bank of America Corporation is a recipient\nof federal funding through the Troubled Asset Relief Program and that it engages\nin intentional discrimination in imposing check cashing fees. Plaintiff alleges\nDefendants violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d\net seq., he raises claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, alleges Defendants violated his\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution under 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and raises supplemental state claims for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress and vicarious liability.\n\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n1\nIl LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Bail v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\nforma pauperis actions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a\ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.\nPhillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is\nliberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to\nless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Weizel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling\non Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\n\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\n3\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Title VI\n\nCount I raises a claim under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. (D.L. 6 at 2-4). The count fails to set forth plausible claims.\nCount IJ alleges that Bank of America Corporation is a recipient of federal funds by\nreasons of receipt of TARP funds and violated his right to equal protection by\nreason of his race, color, and national origin because it charges illegal fees for\ncashing a corporate commercial disbursement account check in violation of 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000d, et seg. Count I alleges that \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d is being\nutilized in highly concentrated communities of people of color,\u201d and has been\ndetermined by the State of California that the practice violates the California Labor\nCode.\n\nThe Complaint references Exhibits 1 and 2 to support the claim. Exhibit 1 is\n\na receipt that indicates Plaintiff was charged an $8.00 non-customer check cashing\nfee on March 1, 2022. (D.I. 6-1 at 1) Exhibit 2 is a check made payable to Plaintiff\nissued by Bank of America. (Id. at 2)\n\nThe claim is pled in a conclusory manner. Moreover, there are no factual\nallegations that provide a plausible basis to conclude that Bank of America\nintentionally discriminated against Plaintiff because of Plaintiff's race, color and/or\nnational origin as an African American male in violation of Title VI. See 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000d; Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001). Notably,\nExhibit 1 indicates that Plaintiff was charged a check cashing fee because he was a\n\u201cnon-customer\u201d. Accordingly, Count I will be dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend Count I.\n\nB. 42U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n\nCount II raises a claim against Bank of America under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 for\nviolating the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cbased upon\nunconstitutional animus by charging illegal fees for cashing a corporate\ncommercial disbursement account check.\u201d (D.L. 6 at 4)\n\nTo state a claim under section 1981, a plaintiff must allege facts supporting:\n\u201c(1) that plaintiff is a member of a racial minority; (2) intent to discriminate on the\nbasis of race by the defendant; and (3) discrimination concerning one or more of\n\nthe activities enumerated by the statute, which includes the right to make and\nenforce contracts.\u201d Brown v. Philip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001)\n(cleaned up).\n\nPlaintiff alleges in a conclusory manner an intent to discriminate on the basis\nof race. As to the contract requirement, Plaintiff alleges an \u201cimplicit contract\u201d is\ncreated that private citizens will abide by the laws of the city municipal ordinances\nand state statutes while on the private property of public business and that this\n\u201clegal contract relationship\u201d allows to him to sue Bank of America under 42\nUS.C. \u00a7 1981.\n\nAn implicit contract or implied-in-fact contract is a contract formed through\nthe parties\u2019 conduct. The parties\u2019 intent and mutual assent to an implied-in-fact\ncontract is proven through conduct rather than words. Chase Manhattan Bank v.\nIridium Afr. Corp., 239 F. Supp. 2d 402, 408 (D. Del. 2002), report and\nrecommendation adopted, 294 F. Supp. 2d 634 (D. Del. 2003). An agreement\nimplied in fact is \u201cfounded upon a meeting of minds, which although not embodied\nin an express contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in\nlight of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.\u201d Hercules Inc. v.\nUnited States, 516 U.S. 417, 424 (1996). The elements required to form an\nimplied-in-fact contract are identical to those required for an express agreement,\nthat is offer, acceptance and consideration. In the Matter of Penn Central, 831 F.2d\n\n1221, 1228 (3d Cir.1987); In re Phillips Petroleum Securities Litigation, 697 F.\n6\nSupp. 1344, 1356 (D. Del. 1988). In addition, there must be a meeting of the\nminds. Chase Manhattan Bank v. Iridium Afr. Corp., 239 F. Supp. 2d at 408. To\nbe a legally binding implied-in-fact contract, the parties\u2019 mutual assent to the\ncontract terms must be objectively manifest or shown. Jd. Mutual assent is neither\na subjective nor personal understanding. Creditors\u2019 Comm. of Essex Builders, Inc.\nv. Farmers Bank, 251 A.2d 546 (Del. 1969).\n\nIt is far from clear if there was a contract between the parties in light of the\ninvoluntary nature of the fee charged Plaintiff and Plaintiff's apparent\ndisagreement with the check cashing fee. Given that there was no meeting of the\nminds, it cannot be said that an implicit contract existed. Moreover, as previously\ndiscussed, the allegations are conclusory. Accordingly, Count II will be dismissed.\nPlaintiff will be given leave to amend the claim.\n\nC.  42U.8.C. \u00a7 1983\n\nCounts III and IV attempt to raise claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \u201cTo state\na claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the\nConstitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged\ndeprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d See West\n\nv. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\nThe claims fail as a matter of law. Neither Defendant is a state actor acting\nunder the color of state law \u2014 a necessary element to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.\nTherefore, Counts III and IV will be dismissed. Amendment is futile.\n\nD. Claims under Delaware Law\n\n1. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n\nCount V raises an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against\nDefendant Melissa Anne Greller who is a branch manager with Bank of America.\n(D.I. 6 at 8) Plaintiff alleges that Greller intentionally discriminated against him\nand violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that he spoke to Greller by telephone on February 25, 2022,\nand she told Plaintiff that he could cash a corporate check drawn on a Bank of\nAmerica commercial disbursement account. (/d.) At the bank, Plaintiff was\ncharged an illegal fee to cash the check. (/d.) Plaintiff spoke to Greller, who\nrecalled speaking to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff asked her for a copy of Bank of\nAmerica\u2019s written corporate policy for check cashing fees. (/d.) Greller refused.\n(id.) Plaintiff alleges that Greller told him Bank of America had been charging\nthese fees to the Black community for five years. (/d. at 9)\n\nWhile Plaintiff sat in the lobby and started placing his paperwork into a\nfolder he overheard Greller direct a security guard to ask Plaintiff to immediately\n\nleave the bank because it was not available to customers due to COVID\n8\nrestrictions. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges the pandemic restrictions had lifted and this is\nfurther evidence of Greller\u2019s unconstitutional animus. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges the\nextreme stress he endured from Greller caused several heart attacks. (d.)\n\nDelaware applies Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 in defining the\nelements of intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Cummings v. Pinder,\n574 A.2d 843, 845 (Del. 1990) (per curiam). That section imposes liability, in\nrelevant part, on \u201cOne who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or\nrecklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such\nemotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily\nharm.\u201d Outrageous conduct is \u201cconduct that exceeds the bounds of decency and is\nregarded as intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d Goode v. Bayhealth Med. Ctr.,\nInc., 2007 WL 2050761, at *2 (Del. July 18, 2007).\n\nCount V fails to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\nAs alleged and as referenced in Exhibit 1, Greller followed Bank of America\npolicy in charging a non-customer check cashing fee. Moreover, the alleged facts\nare not acts that exceed the bounds of decency or that are regarded as intolerable in\na civilized community. Businesses routinely charge individuals customer or\nservice fees. Also, it cannot be said that Greller\u2019s alleged lone statement that\nBank of America regularly charged fees to the Black community is regarded as\n\nintolerable in a civilized community. As pled, Count V fails to state a claim upon\n9\nwhich relief can be granted, and it will be dismissed. Plaintiff will be given leave\nto amend Count V.\n2. Vicarious Liability\n\nCount VI alleges that Bank of America is vicariously liable for the acts of\nGreller, its employee. All of the Counts have been dismissed. Thus, the vicarious\nliability claims against Bank of America are not cognizable. See Verrastro v.\nBayhospitalists, LLC, 208 A.3d 720, 724 (Del. 2019). Accordingly, Count VI will\nbe dismissed for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff\nwill be given leave to amend Count VI.\nIV. ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATION\n\nPlaintiff seeks electronic notification. (D.I. 4) The motion will be denied\nwithout prejudice. It is not clear if Plaintiff moves to file electronically. If that is\nhis intent, as required by this Court, Plaintiff must indicate that he has\nindependently reviewed all of the materials and related topics on the Court\u2019s web\nsite related to electronic filing and he must have a PACER account. His motion\ndoes not meet these requirements.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny without prejudice to renew\n\nPlaintiff's request for electronic notification (D.I. 6); (2) dismiss the Amended\n\n10\nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)() and (ii); and (3) give Plaintiff\nleave to amend Counts I, II, V, and VI.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n11\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nDAVID Q.
