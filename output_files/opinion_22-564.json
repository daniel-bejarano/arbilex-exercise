Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nOctober | , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nWILLIAMS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPlaintiff Michael P. Wagner filed this personal injury action on April 28,\n2022. (D.I.2) He appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma\npauperis. (D.I. 4) He asserts jurisdiction by reason of diversity of the parties\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The Court proceeds to review and screen the\nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b).\nL BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d\nCir. 2008). Plaintiff was injured while driving in the Lowe\u2019s parking lot. Plaintiff\nis a resident of Delaware, as are Defendants Deanna, a manager at the Camden,\nDelaware Lowe\u2019s, Heather, a customer service counter clerk at the Camden County\nLowe\u2019s, and Lowe\u2019s of Camden, Delaware. (D.I. 2 at 2; DI. 2-1 at 1) The\nremaining Defendants have addresses in Mooresville, North Carolina. (D.I. 2 at 2)\nPlaintiff seeks more than $75,000 in compensatory damages. (Jd. at 3)\nII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks\n\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\n1\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\nforma pauperis actions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a\ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.\nPhillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is\nliberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to\nless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling\non Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a\n2\nclaim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\n\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\nII. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Complaint does not confer this Court with jurisdiction. There is not\ncomplete diversity of citizenship among the parties and, therefore, there is no\ndiversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The Complaint names seven\nDefendants, three of whom are citizens of the State of Delaware as is Plaintiff.\n\u201cDiversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1) requires the existence of\ncomplete diversity between the parties\u2014 that is, no plaintiff can be a citizen of the\nsame state as any of the defendants.\u201d Siravo v. Crown, Cork & Seal Co., 256 F.\nApp'x 577, 579 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Grand Union Supermarkets of the V.I., Inc.\nv. H.E. Lockhart Memt., Inc., 316 F.3d 408, 410 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted). In addition, the Complaint does not raise any claims\nunder federal law to confer this Court with subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nBecause the requisites for diversity jurisdiction have not been met and there\nis no federal question, this Court does not have jurisdiction matter over this action.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint for want of\njurisdiction. Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nMICHAEL P. WAGNER, )\n)\n\nPlaintiff, )\n\n)\n\nv. ) C.A.
