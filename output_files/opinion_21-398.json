Acthar  Plaintiffs further challenge the nunc pro tunc  nature of the \nrelief granted, arguing that a recent Supreme Co urt decision overruled Third Circuit precedent \ngiving bankruptcy courts discreti on to grant such relief.  For th e reasons that follow, the Court \nwill affirm the OCP Order. II. BACKGROUND   \nA.  Ordinary Course Professionals Motion On October 12, 2020, Debtors filed their chapte r 11 petitions in the Bankruptcy Court.  \nTwo days later, on October 14, 2020, Debtors filed a motion seeking to retain certain ordinary \ncourse professionals (\u201cOCPs\u201d) to represent them in matters arising in the ordinary course of their \nbusiness.  (APP1-38) (\u201cOCP Motion\u201d)  The OCP Mo tion set forth the reasons these professionals \nwere essential for Debtors to continue their nor mal business activities and further their chapter \n11 cases.  (APP12)  The OCP Motion asserted that  failure to retain the OCPs would severely \nhinder Debtors\u2019 efforts, as ther e was a significant risk  that OCPs would be unwilling to provide \nservices or would suspend serv ices without a court order authorizing re tention.  (APP12)  \nAccordingly, Debtors sought authorization to \u201ccontinue to employ and retain\u201d certain OCPs \nlisted in a schedule attached to the OCP Motion (APP6), and requested that authorization be \nentered \u201c nunc pro tunc \u201d to the petition date (i.e., two days  before the OCP Motion was filed) for \nprofessionals who had been engaged prepetition (APP7).  The OCP Motion made clear that the \nrelief requested was \u201cto avoid a ny subsequent controversy as to  the Debtors\u2019 employment and \npayment of the Ordinary Cour se Professionals during these chapter 11 cases.\u201d  (APP12) \nThe OCP Motion proposed a retention proce dure under which each OCP was required to 3 \n submit a \u201cDeclaration of Disinterestedness\u201d certifying that the OCP \u201cdoes not represent or hold \nany interest adverse to the Debt ors or their estates with respect to the matter(s) on which the \nprofessional is to be employed.\u201d  (APP6-7; see also  APP35-38 (form Declaration of \nDisinterestedness attached to the OCP Motion))  The OCP Motion established a procedure under \nwhich objections could be made to individual OCPs within 14 da ys of service of the OCP\u2019s \nDeclaration of Disinterestedness.   (APP7)  Incurred fees and e xpenses, which were subject to \npayment caps, could be paid without formal appl ication and would be memo rialized in periodic \npayment summaries filed with the Ba nkruptcy Court.  (APP8-9, APP23-24) \nThe OCP Motion included a Notice of Motion and Hearing stating that \u201cobjections or \nresponses to the relief re quested in the Motion, if any, must be  made in writing and filed . . . on \nor before November 3, 2020 at 4:00 p.m.\u201d  (APP 16)  The notice further provided that, in the \nabsence of objections, the Bankruptcy Court \u201cm ay grant the relief requested in the motion \nwithout further notice or  hearing.\u201d  (APP17) \nA group designated as the \u201cMulti-State Gove rnmental Entities Group\u201d filed a limited \nobjection, arguing that it should be  included as a part y entitled to notice under the retention \nprocedures set forth therein.  (APP39-43)  The U.S. Trustee filed a limited objection, arguing \nthat the form Declaration of Disinterestedness should include \u201ca statement of disinterestedness \nrequired by section 327(a) of the Bankruptcy Code w ith respect to any entity that is either not a \nlaw firm, or is a law firm that  did not represent the Debtors pr ior to their bankruptcy filing.\u201d  \n(APP44-51)  The Acthar Plaintiffs asked that the deadline for objections  be extended.  (APP53; \nAPP1009-12)  Debtors agreed, extending the de adline until November 5, 2020 (APP1009) \u2013 yet \nthe Acthar Plaintiffs did not file any objections to the OCP Motion.   \nOn November 10, 2020, Debtors certified that the limited objections to the OCP Motion 4 \n had been resolved and provided a revised pr oposed order, which was uncontested.  (APP52-99, \n137-38; see also  APP60, 81 (revising OCP Order to incl ude Multi-State Governmental Entities \nGroup as party entitled to notice); APP76- 77, 98-99 (revising form Declaration of \nDisinterestedness to reflect potenti al additional requirements if an  OCP \u201cis not a law firm\u201d)   \nB. Ordinary Course Professionals Order On November 10, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered the revised proposed OCP Order \n(APP100-08), which provided for retention nunc pro tunc  to the petition date and gave each OCP \nthat had already commenced postpetition services  for Debtors 30 days to file the required \ndeclaration (APP102).  \nOn December 3, 2020, after having failed to objec t to the OCP Motion itself, the Acthar \nPlaintiffs filed an Omnibus Objection to Re tention of \u201cOrdinary C ourse Professionals\u201d by \nDebtors.  (APP154-89)  The Acthar Plaintiffs argued, among other things , that retaining the \nOCPs would not \u201cbenefit . . . the estate\u201d because  the OCPs\u2019 \u201cservices are not needed at this \ntime,\u201d given that \u201clitigation pending against the Debtors is stayed.\u201d  (APP156-58)  The Acthar \nPlaintiffs also argued that the OCPs were not reta ined \u201cin the \u2018ordinary course\u2019 of their business\u201d \nand had not filed adequate disclo sures.  (APP162-74)  The Acthar Plaintiffs later filed a Second \nOmnibus Objection, raising substantially the same arguments.   (APP242-61)    \nOn February 4, 2021, the Acthar Plaintiffs filed an objection specific to Debtors\u2019 \nretention of Skadden.  (APP411-81)  The objec tion attacked the adequacy of Skadden\u2019s \ndisclosures, citing in part icular language that came fro m the form Declaration of \nDisinterestedness approved as part  of the OCP Order.  (APP415-16)  The Acthar Plaintiffs later \nfiled a notice of deposition for a Skadden part ner and also moved to  compel discovery.  \n(APP880-92; APP896-971) 5 \n C. Approval of Specific Ordinary  Course Professionals    \nFollowing full briefing on the Acthar Plainti ffs\u2019 objections, the Bankruptcy Court held a \nhearing on February 25, 2021.  (APP1316-99)  Pr ior to the hearing, the Bankruptcy Court \nindicated that it would be ruling based on the pa rties\u2019 submissions and that there would be no \ntestimony, exhibits, or oral argument.  (APP 1306, 1382)  In its bench ruling, the Bankruptcy \nCourt held that \u201c[t]he OCP order is  a final order\u201d with respect to the issues the Acthar Plaintiffs \nraised in their objections, and th at \u201c[t]he Acthar Plaintiffs di d not address in their objections \nwhy, if they objected to the debtors\u2019 ability to retain any OCPs, they did not object to the OCP \nmotion at the time it was pending before the Court.\u201d  (APP1383) (emphasis added)  Based on \nthat failure and its final determination of releva nt issues in the OCP Or der, the Bankruptcy Court \nexplained that to \u201ccollateral[ly] attack . . . the ab ility of this Court to en ter the OCP order in the \nfirst instance,\u201d the Acthar Plaintiffs needed to se ek relief under \u201cFederal Rule of Civil Procedure \n60, made applicable to these proceedings by Federal Rule[] of  Bankruptcy Procedure 9024.\u201d  \n(APP1383-84)  The Bankruptcy Court overruled the Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 obj ections because they \ndid not attempt to satisfy Rule  60\u2019s requirements.  (APP1384) \nThe Bankruptcy Court, \u201chaving read and c onsidered the objections , the responses, and \nthe various declarations filed by the OCPs,\u201d \u201coverrule[d] the objecti ons on the merits, as well.\u201d  \n(APP1384)  With respect to the Acthar Plainti ffs\u2019 argument that retent ion of OCPs would not \n\u201cbenefit . . . the estate\u201d because their \u201cservices are not needed at  this time\u201d becau se \u201clitigation \npending against the Debtors is stayed,\u201d the Bankr uptcy Court explained th at \u201c[j]ust because the \nactions are stayed . . . does not mean that th e debtors do not need [the  OCPs\u2019] assistance; for \nexample, in negotiating potential resolutions of those claims,\u201d as  the stay \u201cdoes not prevent the \ndebtor from trying to settle them,\u201d and because \u201c[t]he debtors will need to be prepared to go 6 \n forward with those actions, if se ttlement discussions are not fruit ful,\u201d since \u201cthose cases will not \nremain stayed forever.\u201d  (APP1385)  The Bankruptcy  Court next rejected the Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 \narguments regarding the adequacy of Skadden\u2019 s declarations and disc losures.  (APP1385-86) \nThe Bankruptcy Court held that all of the disput ed litigation counsel OC Ps had complied with \nthe OCP Order by submitting declar ations representing that the OC P does not \u201chold any interest \nadverse to the debtors or their estates with re spect to the matter or matters on which the \nprofessional is to be employed.\u201d  (APP1386)  Finally, the Bankrupt cy Court rejected the Acthar \nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that nunc pro tunc  relief was categorically una vailable following a recent \nSupreme Court decision.  (APP 1386-87)  Having overruled the Acth ar Plaintiffs\u2019 objections as \n\u201cwithout merit,\u201d the Bankruptcy Court denied their motion to compel discovery as moot.  \n(APP1387) \nThe Bankruptcy Court then provided counsel fo r the Acthar Plaintif fs an opportunity to \nbe heard.  (APP1387-88)  The Ac thar Plaintiffs sought to in troduce 55 exhibits relating to \nSkadden or to make a specific pr offer as to the contents of each exhibit.  (APP1388, 1390-91)  \nThe Bankruptcy Court denied those requests but a llowed counsel to \u201cproffer\u201d what the \u201cexhibits \nand the deposition\u201d would have shown and \u201chow they\u2019d be relevant to the motion.\u201d  (APP1388-\n91)  In seven uninterrupted pages of the transcri pt, the Acthar Plaintiffs  generally described the \nexhibits and repeated the argumen ts made in their objection to De btors\u2019 retention of Skadden.  \n(APP1391-97)  On March 5, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the \nDebtors to retain the OC Ps.  (APP1424-25)    \nD. Appeal  \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs timely appealed the OCP Or der.  (D.I. 1)  The merits of the appeal \nare fully briefed.  (D.I. 16, 19, 21)  No party re quested oral argument.  The Court did not hear 7 \n oral argument because the facts and legal arguments  are adequately presented in the briefs and \nrecord and the decisional process would not  be significantly aide d by oral argument. \nIII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n   Appeals from the Bankruptcy Court to  this Court are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158.  \nPursuant to \u00a7 158(a), district co urts have mandatory jurisdicti on to hear appeals \u201cfrom final \njudgments, orders, and decrees.\u201d  A bankruptcy court has \u201cconsider able discretion in approving  \n. . . retention under the standards of section 327 in light of the specific fact s and circumstances of \nthe case.\u201d  Century Indem. Co. v. Boy Scouts of Am. (In re Boy Scouts of Am.) , 2021 WL \n1820574, at *5 (D. Del. May 6, 2021).  A bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on a \u00a7 327(e) application \n\u201cis reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d  Phila. Newspapers, LLC v. Off.

(In re \nPillowtex, Inc.) , 304 F.3d 246, 250 (3d Cir. 2002)).  \u201cAn abuse of discretion exists  where the . . . \ncourt\u2019s decision rests upon a clearl y erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an \nimproper application of law to fact.\u201d  Id. at 597 (internal quotation ma rks omitted).  \u201cA decision \nto grant nunc pro tunc  approval is in the discre tion of the bankruptcy cour t, and is reviewed for \nabuse of discretion only.\u201d  F/S Airlease II, Inc. v. Simon , 844 F.2d 99, 103 (3d Cir. 1988) \n(citation omitted).  IV.   DISCUSSION  \nA. The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Err in Overruling \nthe Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 Objectio ns as Untimely and Meritless  \n \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 objections were overr uled by the Bankruptcy Court on two bases: \n(1) the objections were untimely and could not be sustained under Rule 60(b), and (2) the \nobjections were without merit.   The Acthar Plaintiffs ch allenge only the first reason. \n 8 \n 1. The Acthar Plaintiffs Failed to Ti mely Object to the OCP Motion \nThe OCP Motion included a framework for approving specified OCPs, including \nprocedures under which the OCPs could file Decl arations of Disinteres tedness; the information \nto be included therein; and inst ructions that it must include a statement that the applicant does \nnot \u201chold[] or repres ent[] any interest a dverse to the Debtors or their estates with respect to the \nmatter(s) upon which the Firm is to be employed.\u201d  (APP37)  The OCP Motion also made clear \nthat upon resolution of any objections to an in dividual OCP\u2019s declarati on, the OCP would be \napproved nunc pro tunc  to the petition date.  (APP104)    \nUnder those procedures, any obj ections to the OCP Motion ha d to be filed by November \n3, 2020.  (APP16-17)  Multiple objections were filed.  (APP39-43; APP44-51)  The Acthar \nPlaintiffs asked for (and receiv ed) an extension of time.  (APP 53; APP1009-12)  But the Acthar \nPlaintiffs never filed any objections to any aspe ct of the relief Debtors sought in the OCP \nMotion.  With all the filed object ions resolved, the Bankruptcy C ourt entered the OCP Order.  \n(APP100-08) \nOn these undisputed facts, the Bankruptcy Cour t correctly held that the Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 \nlater objections were untimely.  The vast majority  of the objections coul d have (and should have) \nbeen raised in response to the OCP Motion itself.  For example, the Acthar Plaintiffs argued that \nlanguage in Skadden\u2019s declarat ion was \u201cvague, unrevealing, ev en potentially misleading and \ndisqualifying.\u201d  (APP415-16)  But as the Debtor s correctly point out, th e quoted language came \ndirectly from the form Declaration of Disi nterestedness attached to the OCP Motion and \napproved by the OCP Order.  ( See APP97-99)  Next, the Acthar Plaintiffs objected to Debtors \nretaining litigation counsel OCPs , categorically, on the ground th at retention would not benefit \nthe estate.  ( See APP156-58)  But that, too, was a focu s of the OCP Motion, which explained 9 \n why such retentions were in the best interest  of the estate, and attached a schedule listing \nnumerous OCPs that would provide litigation services.  ( See APP28-34)  These objections \u2013 and \nothers that went to Debt ors\u2019 \u201cability to retain any OCPs,\u201d \u201cthe ability of th[e Bankruptcy] Court \nto enter the OCP order in the first instance as  violative of the provi sions of the Bankruptcy \nCode,\u201d and the procedures for retention se t forth in the OCP Mo tion, including the form \nDeclaration of Disinterestedness and the nunc pro tunc  request \u2013 were all improper \u201ccollateral \nattack[s]\u201d on the OCP Order itse lf.  (APP1383-84) (emphasis added) \nActhar Plaintiffs contend that they could not have objected, or at least were not required \nto object, until after individual OCPs had filed their declarations in compliance with the OCP \nOrder.  (D.I. 16 at 17-19)  But as the Acthar  Plaintiffs concede, the OCP Order itself \n\u201cauthorized\u201d what they call the \u201cextra-statutor y procedure for retaining ordinary course \nprofessionals.\u201d  ( Id. at 18)  The OCP Order did more than \u201csuggest[] that nunc pro tunc relief \nwould be granted\u201d ( id.); it provided that once any objection to  a Declaration of Disinterestedness \nwas resolved, \u201cthe Debtors shall be authorized to retain the Ordinary Course Professional on a \nfinal basis, without furt her order of the Court, nunc pro tunc  to the later of the petition date and \nthe date of engagement.\u201d  (APP104)  As the Ba nkruptcy Court held, if the Acthar Plaintiffs \nbelieved the procedures finally established in the OCP Order were improper, they could and \nshould have objected at that time \u2013 just as other partie s and the U.S. Trustee did. \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 suggesti on that they would not have ha d \u201cstanding\u201d to object at an \nearlier time lacks merit.  (D.I. 16 at 18-19)  As an initial matter, the question is not whether the \nActhar Plaintiffs would have had standing to appe al the OCP Order, but whether they could have \nfiled an objection to the OCP Motion (like every one else).  The only case cited by the Acthar \nPlaintiffs in support is inapposite.  ( Id. at 18) (citing Chadwick v. Janecka , 312 F.3d 597, 602 (3d 10 \n Cir. 2002))  As Debtors point out , the purpose of the OCP Motion was to authorize Debtors to \nretain certain OCPs (listed in the attached schedule ), pursuant to a particular  procedure (set out in \nthe motion), nunc pro tunc  to the petition date.  The notion that the Acthar Plaintiffs were \npowerless to object because the OC Ps might voluntarily provide mo re information than required \nby the OCP Order or seek less relief than author ized by the OCP Order is unavailing.  (D.I. 16 at \n19).  If the Acthar Plaintiffs did not have sufficient in jury to object to the OCP procedures then, \nthe mere filing of the expected decl arations did not change that.    \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs also fault the Bankrupt cy Court for applying Rule 60.  As Debtors \nexplain, the Achtar Plaintiffs mis understand the Rule\u2019s relevance.  (D.I. 16 at 19-21)  The Acthar \nPlaintiffs forfeited the right to object to the OCP Motion by failing to timely object.  But if the \nActhar Plaintiffs were able to satisfy the requ irements of Rule 60 then, perhaps, the Bankruptcy \nCourt could have excused that fo rfeiture.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b); see also  Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9024 \n(incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 in bankruptcy ca ses).  The Bankruptcy C ourt simply held that \nthe Acthar Plaintiffs made no attempt to sati sfy the Rule 60(b) requirements.  (APP1383-84)  \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs agree that they could not (and did not try to) satisfy  those requirements.  \n(D.I. 16 at 20)    \n2. Acthar Plaintiffs Have Not Challenged \nthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Ruling on the Merits   \nThe Bankruptcy Court did not rest on the Ac thar Plaintiffs\u2019 forfe iture; the Bankruptcy \nCourt also overruled the Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 ob jections on the merits.  (APP1384-86)  With the \nexception of nunc pro tunc relief, discussed below, the Acthar  Plaintiffs do not challenge the \nBankruptcy Court\u2019s merits determ ination on appeal.  The unchalleng ed merits determination thus \nprovides an independent ground for affirmance.  See First Fid. Bank v. Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. (In \nre Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H.) , 879 F.2d 987, 989-90 (1st Cir. 1989) ( per curiam ) (affirmance 11 \n required where appellant challenged only one of  two alternate bases for bankruptcy court\u2019s \ndecision); see also Chong v. Dist. Dir., INS , 264 F.3d 378, 391 (3d Cir. 2001).  \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cStatement of the Ca se\u201d is replete with obj ections made in the \nBankruptcy Court with respect to \u201cl itigation counsel\u201d in general ( see D.I. 16 at 6) or Skadden in \nparticular ( see id. at 7-9).  But they do not advance any of those objections on appeal.  The \nclosest they come is a passing reference in the Op ening Brief\u2019s \u201cStatement of the Issues\u201d to the \n\u201csufficien[cy]\u201d of \u201cSkadden\u2019s disclosures.\u201d  ( Id. at 2)  But that issue is nowhere to be found in \nthe argument section of their br ief.  Accordingly, as with th e other objections abandoned on \nappeal, that issue has been waived.  See Nagle v. Alspach , 8 F.3d 141, 143 (3d Cir. 1993); see \nalso Reynolds v. Wagner , 128 F.3d 166, 178 (3d Cir. 1997) (holdi ng that arguments mentioned in \npassing, but not squarely argue d, will be deemed waived); Forever Green Athletic Fields, Inc. v. \nDawson , 514 B.R. 768, 781 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (finding arguments waived where appellants \n\u201clist[ed] [them in] issues for review but . . . fa iled to match many of thos e issues to arguments \nwith citations to the au thorities . . . [and] ci ted no case law or statut es in support of their \ncontention[s]\u201d), aff\u2019d sub nom. In re Forever Green Athletic Fields, Inc ., 804 F.3d 328 (3d Cir. \n2015). \nB. The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Violate \nthe Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 Due Process Rights \n The Acthar Plaintiffs argue that the Bankr uptcy Court deprived them of due process \nwhen it ruled on their obj ections without giving them an oppor tunity to cross-examine Skadden\u2019s \ndeclarant or enter certain exhibits into evidence at the hearing.  (D.I. 16  at 24-26)  The Court \ndoes not agree. \n\u201cDue process mandates that a judicial procee ding give all parties an opportunity to be \nheard on the critical and decisive  allegations which go to the co re of the parties\u2019 claim or 12 \n defense.\u201d  Villanueva Compania Naviera, S.A. v. Bethle hem Steel Corp. (In re Complaint of \nBankers Tr. Co.) , 752 F.2d 874, 890 (3d Cir. 1984).  An unsecured creditor has no constitutional \nright to introduce specific evidence in the cont ext of a bankruptcy cour t\u2019s decision to approve a \ndebtor\u2019s retention of an ordina ry course professional.  The only bankruptcy cases the Acthar \nPlaintiffs cite stand for the simple proposition th at debtors and creditors have a constitutional \nright to be heard before bei ng deprived of their property.  See In re Tribune Media Co ., 902 F.3d \n384, 389 (3d Cir. 2018) (appeal by creditor of  disallowance of creditor\u2019s claims); In re Bartle,  \n560 F.3d 724, 727 (7th Cir. 2009) (appeal by debtor  of dismissal of debtor\u2019s Chapter 11 \nproceeding); In re Boomgarden , 780 F.2d 657, 658 (7th Cir. 1985) (appeal by debtor of lifting of \nautomatic stay for sale of debtor \u2019s property).  Acthar Plaintiffs  argue that any payment of the \nOCPs will be \u201cto the detriment of the distribu tion to the general body of unsecured creditors.\u201d \n(D.I. 21 at 8-9)  But the OCP Orde r did not deprive the Acthar Plai ntiffs of their property.  Any \nconnection between the retention of Skadden (the only OCP about which the Acthar Plaintiffs \nsought to introduce evidence)  and the Acthar Plainti ffs\u2019 claims is attenuated  at best.  Without any \ncognizable property right at issu e, the Acthar Plaintiffs canno t establish that the retention \napplication proceedings even implicated thei r due process rights in the first place. \nIn any event, no violation occu rred.  Most procedural and ev identiary errors do not give \nrise to a due process violation.  See, e.g. Cevilla v. Gonzales , 446 F.3d 658, 662 (7th Cir. 2006) \n(\u201c[A] mere procedural or evidentia ry error must not be confused w ith a denial of due process.\u201d).  \nNone of the bankruptcy cases the Acthar Plaintiffs cite found a due process violation.  See In re \nTribune Media Co ., 902 F.3d at 396-98; In re Bartle , 560 F.3d at 730-31; In re Boomgarden , 780 \nF.2d at 662.  To the extent the Acthar Plaintiffs ha d any constitutional right,  it was the right to be \nheard.  And they were.  The Acthar Plaintiffs filed three different rounds  of objections.  They 13 \n were present at (and given the opportunity to  make a proffer during) the hearing.  The \nBankruptcy Court was already fami liar with the relevant facts of the case and indicated its \nreview of all pleadings.  The Acth ar Plaintiffs were not  constitutionally entitled \u201cto a particular \ntype of hearing.\u201d  In re Bartle,  560 F.3d at 729; see Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton v. Dep\u2019t \nof Health & Human Servs ., 844 F. Supp. 770, 788 (D.D.C. 1993) (\u201cTh [e] right to present specific \nevidence is not constituti onally protected\u201d).    \nFinally, the Court agrees  with the Debtors that any erro r would be harmless.  Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 61, which applies in bankruptcy proceedings, instructs courts to \n\u201cdisregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party\u2019s subs tantial rights.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n61; see Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9005 (incorpor ating Fed. R. Civ. P. 61); In re Bartle , 560 F.3d at 730.  \nFor the Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csubstantial rights\u201d to  have been affected, there would have to be \nevidence they were precluded from presenting th at would have changed the outcome; that is, \nevidence that would have caused the Bankruptcy Court to disapprove Skadden\u2019s retention.  The \nActhar Plaintiffs made an  extensive proffer.  ( See APP1391-97)  But, on appeal, the Acthar \nPlaintiffs do not identify any specific evidence they were precluded from introducing that would \nhave changed the outcome.  The Acthar Plaintiffs \u2019 failure to provide any \u201creason to believe\u201d that \nthe purported \u201cdeprivation of the op portunity to be heard . . . pr ejudiced\u201d them is yet another \nreason why their due process claim lacks merit.  In re Bartle , 560 F.3d at 730. \nC. Nunc Pro Tunc  Relief Was Neither Error Nor Abuse of Discretion \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that nunc pro tunc relief is categorically unavailable was \nforfeited by their failure to timely object to  this aspect of the OCP Mo tion.  As further explained \nbelow, the argument also fails on the merits. \n    14 \n 1. The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Abuse Its \nDiscretion By Granting Retroactive Approval \n \nUnder controlling Third Circuit law, \u201cbankrupt cy courts have the power to authorize \nretroactive employment of counsel  and other professionals under their broad equity power . . . \n[w]here equitable concerns weigh in favor of granting retroactiv e approval to enable deserving \nprofessionals to recover compensa tion for work actually done.\u201d  In re Arkansas Co ., 798 F.2d \n645, 650 (3d Cir. 1986).   \u201c[R]etroactive approval\u201d may be gran ted if \u201cprior approval would have \nbeen appropriate\u201d and \u201cthe delay in seek ing approval was due to hardship beyond the \nprofessional\u2019s control.\u201d  Id. at 650; see also  F/S Airlease II, Inc. v. Simon , 844 F.2d 99, 105 (3d \nCir. 1988).  Such \u201cretroactive approval\u201d is  reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Arkansas Co ., 798 \nF.2d at 650. \nThe default rule for bankruptcy courts in Delawa re is that retention is effective \u201cas of the \ndate the motion was filed.\u201d  Del. Bankr. L.R. 2014-1(b).  Bankruptcy cour ts routinely authorize \nretroactive approval to th e bankruptcy petition date,3 and district courts and courts of appeals \nroutinely affirm such ap provals under an abuse of  discretion standard.4  Moreover, the Office of \nthe U.S. Trustee\u2019s long-held position is that it will \u201cnot ordinarily object\u201d if \u201cretention \napplications\u201d for \u201cprofessionals\u201d are \u201cfiled  within 30 days of the petition date.\u201d  In re United \nCos. Fin. Corp ., 241 B.R. 521, 526 (Bankr. D. Del. 1999).  Hence, as counsel for Acthar \nPlaintiffs has admitted below, nunc pro tunc  relief \u201chas been the cu stom and practice in this \njurisdiction for a l ong time.\u201d  (APP868) \n \n3 See, e.g., In re Art Van Furniture , LLC, 617 B.R. 509, 519-20 (Bankr. D. Del. 2020). \n \n4 See, e.g., Boy Scouts of Am ., 2021 WL 1820574, at *6-8; In re Woodworkers Warehouse , Inc., \n323 B.R. 403, 405 (D. Del. 2005).    15 \n The Bankruptcy Court was well within its disc retion in following the established case law \nand finding retroactive a pproval appropriate here.  There was no delay in seeking approval of the \nOCPs as counsel.  Debtors filed an  application just two days afte r filing the bankruptcy petitions.  \n(APP1-38)  The OCP Motion request ed, and the OCP Order granted, nunc pro tunc  relief.  \n(APP7; APP104)  No party objected to th at aspect of the OCP Order.    \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs quote at length from In re Arkansas  and argue that \u201c nunc pro tunc  \nshould be the exception, not the rule.\u201d  (D.I. 16 at 46-47)  But this case looks nothing like In re \nArkansas Co . \u2013 or F/S Airlease II .  In In re Arkansas , 798 F.2d at 646, a law firm represented the \ncreditors committee for 13 months after the bankruptcy petition ha d been filed before filing any \nmotion with the bankruptcy court seeking appr oval of its employmen t under \u00a7 1103(a).  In F/S \nAirlease II , 844 F.2d at 102, a broker waited 10 months after starting work, and seven months \nafter the bankruptcy court had approved the leas e he negotiated, before asking the court to pay \nhis administrative expenses under Section 503.  In both cases, the Third Circuit was focused on \nthe statutory pre-approval requirem ents, which were designed to en sure that the bankruptcy court \n\u201cknow[s] the type of individual who is enga ged in the proceeding, their integrity, their \nexperience in connection with work of this t ype, as well as their competency concerning the \nsame.\u201d  Id. at 106 (internal quotation ma rks omitted).  There was no comparable pre-approval \nconcern in this case.  All parties were on no tice \u2013 since the third da y of the chapter 11 \nproceedings \u2013 that Debtors were se eking approval to retain the OCPs. \nAlthough the Acthar Plaintiffs  assert the Debtors need to show \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to obtain nunc pro tunc  relief (D.I. 16 at 39-40), the case law suggests otherwise.  \nCourts require a heightened showing when ther e has been a months-long delay before seeking \napproval; it is not required when an applicati on is filed within a \u201crea sonable time\u201d \u2013 usually 16 \n defined as within 30 days of the petition date (consistent with the U.S. Trustee\u2019s position).  See, \ne.g., In re Sound Radio, Inc ., 145 B.R. 193, 205 n.18 (Bankr. D.N.J. 1992) (explaining that \n\u201cthirty days from the commencemen t of the case\u201d is \u201ca reasonab le time\u201d for application, but \n\u201c[a]fter thirty days,\u201d de lay requires explanation); In re Martin , 102 B.R. 653, 656 (Bankr. W.D. \nTenn. 1989) (same); In re Sinor,  87 B.R. 620, 623 (Bankr. E. D. Cal. 1988) (same).   \n2. The Supreme Court\u2019s Recent Decision \nDoes Not Overrule Third Circuit Precedent \n \nActhar Plaintiffs further argue that the Supreme C ourt\u2019s recent decision in Roman \nCatholic Archdiocese of San Juan v. Acevedo Feliciano , 140 S. Ct. 696 (2020) ( per curiam ), \neffectively overruled Third Circuit precedent and long-standing bankruptcy practice and now \ncategorically precludes bankrupt cy courts from retroactivel y approving the retention of \nprofessionals.  Acthar Plaintiffs same raised this precise argument in connection with their \nappeal of another firm\u2019s nunc pro tunc retention in these same chapter 11 proceedings.  See City \nof Rockford v. Mallinckrodt, PLC, et al ., Civ. No. 21-268-LPS.  In a Memorandum issued this \nsame date, the Court rejected the Achtar Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments under Acevedo , and it does so here \nagain, for the same reasons.  ( See id.  D.I. 15 at 16-20) \nIn short, Acevedo  did not consider any issu es of bankruptcy law or nunc pro tunc relief.  \nAcevedo \u2019s limited discussion of nunc pro tunc  orders is best understood as specific to \njurisdiction.  Other courts have reached the same c onclusion, determining that Acevedo  simply \nreiterates the well-understood di stinction between a court \u201ccreat[ing] jurisdiction where none \nexists\u201d and granting retroactiv e relief on equitable grounds when  the court indisputably has \njurisdiction to act.  See Merriman v. Fattorini (In re Merriman) , 616 B.R. 381, 391 (B.A.P. 9th \nCir. 2020); see also, e.g., In re Hunanyan , 2021 WL 2389273, at *2 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. June 10, \n2021) (\u201c Acevedo  does not change the existing authority of  the court to approve  employment that 17 \n has commenced before the motion was brought.\u201d); In re SS Body Armor I, Inc.,  2021 WL \n2315177, at *3 (Bankr. D. Del. June 7, 2021) (\u201c Acevedo  does not prohibit courts from entering \nnunc pro tunc  orders where there are no jurisdictional defects.\u201d). \nThe Court disagrees with the Acth ar Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that, after Acevedo , bankruptcy \ncourts have refused to approve re tention of professionals \u201cto obtai n retroactive effect.\u201d  (D.I. 16 \nat 41-43)  Of the 13 cases cited in Acthar Plaint iffs\u2019 lengthy string cite, only three involved the \napproval of professionals.  While thos e cases disagreed with the use of \u201c nunc pro tunc \u201d orders \nafter Acevedo , none held that Acevedo  precludes retroactive compensation.    \nIndeed, as the district  court recognized in In re Benitez , \u201c\u2018[n]unc pro tunc retentions\u2019 are \ncommon practice in bankruptcy matters largel y resulting from the statutory framework for \ncompensation of estate professi onals set forth in sections 327 and 330,\u201d as \u201cthe delay between \ncommencement of services to the estate, the filin g of a motion for court a pproval and the entry of \nthe order approving the reten tion may take several weeks. \u201d  2020 WL 1272258, at *1 (Bankr. \nE.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2020).  \u201cIn most cases it is im practical and possibly detr imental to the estate \nfor the professional to delay prov iding what may be critical serv ices until entry of the order \napproving their retention.\u201d  Id.  Far from barring compensation for pre-approval work, that court \nheld that \u201c nunc pro tunc  or retroactive retention is not necessary\u201d because \u201cthere is no per se  \nprohibition, in the statute or pr ecedential caselaw, against awardi ng reasonable co mpensation to \nan estate professional for actual and necessary serv ices rendered to the estate prior to the date of \ncourt approval of retention.\u201d  Id. at *5 (holding that bankruptc y court may \u201caward[] reasonable \ncompensation to an estate professional for actua l and necessary services rendered to the estate \nprior to the date of court approval of retention\u201d).  See also In re Roberts , 618 B.R. 213, 217 \n(Bankr. S.D. Ohio 2020) (explaini ng that, although \u201cthe use of nunc pro tunc  orders to 18 \n retroactively seek employment of professionals is  an improper use of the mechanism,\u201d that \u201cdoes \nnot mean that services rendered prior to entry of an order authorizing the employment will be \nuncompensated,\u201d since \u201capplicable bankruptcy statutes and rules laying the foundations for \nemployment and compensation do no t require employment to be au thorized prior to performance \nof services\u201d); In re Grinding Specialists, LLC, 625 B.R. 6, 15 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2021) (approving \nemployment of counsel \u201ceffectiv e as of the date the request to employ was presented to, and \ncould have been acted on, by the Court\u201d) \nThe Honorable Mary F. Walrath  has similarly distinguished Acevedo , noting: \u201cThere are \nmany instances in bankruptcy . . . not only [Bankruptcy] Rule 6003, but many instances where \nbecause of the notice requirements the Court is  unable to enter an order on no notice and will \nallow any relief to be nunc pro tunc  to the filing of the retention application.\u201d  (D.I. 20, APP1500 \n(In re Hertz Corp ., No. 20-11218 (Bankr. D. Del.), 12/28/20 Hr\u2019g Tr. at 61:11-15))  Indeed, with \nrespect to \u00a7 327(e) in particul ar, retroactive compensation is not only permissible \u2013 it is \npractically required.  \u201cThe concept of retroactiv e compensation is incorporated into the Federal \nRules of Bankruptcy Procedure,\u201d including \u201cB ankruptcy Rule 6003(a), [under which] an \napplication for employment may no t be approved within the first 21 days of a bankruptcy case, \nabsent a need to avoid immedi ate and irreparable harm.\u201d  In re Miller , 620 B.R. 637, 642 (Bankr. \nE.D. Cal. 2020); see also  Del. Bankr. L.R. 2014-1(b) (requiring  \u201cat least twenty-one (21) days\u2019 \nnotice\u201d before hearing on retention motion).  The Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 expansive reading of \nAcevedo  as a categorical bar on any retroactive approval of profes sional services under \u00a7 327(e) \nis in substantial tension with Bankruptcy Rule 6003.  Miller, 620 B.R. at 642-43 (\u201cNothing in \nAcevedo  suggests the Supreme Court intended to undermine the vitality of Bankruptcy Rule \n6003(a).\u201d). 19 \n V. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the OCP Order will be affirmed.  An appropriate Order \nfollows.  \n       ________________________________ March 28, 2022     HONOR ABLE LEONARD P.
