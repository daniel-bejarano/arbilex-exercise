Act. No. 13-06-LPS\nCr. Act. No. 11-33-LPS\nMEMORANDUM\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPending before the Court is Movant Dmitry Pronin's (\"Movant\") Letter Motion For\nReconsideration Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2) (\"Rule 60(b)(2) Motion\").\n(D.I. 61) For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the Rule 60(b)(2) Motion.\nII. BACKGROUND\nOn March 31, 2017, the Court denied in its entirety Movant's \u00a7 2255 Motion challenging his\n2011 convictions for armed bank robbery and the carrying, using, and brandishing of a firearm\nduring a crime of violence. (D.I. 51; D.I. 52) Movant filed a notice of appeal in the Third Circuit\nCourt of Appeals (D.I. 54; D.I. 55), which the Third Circuit forwarded to this Court with\ninstructions that it should be docketed as filed here on April 21,2017. (D.I. 54-1 at 1) On April 28,\n2017, Movant filed a Rule 59(e) Motion, which the Court denied May 10, 2017. (D.I. 53; D.I. 58;\nD.I. 59) On August 3, 2017, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals terminated Movant's appeal after\ndenying his request for a certificate of appealability. (D.I. 60) Movant filed the instant Rule 60(b)(2)\nMotion on August 15, 2017. (D.I. 61)\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA motion filed pxirsuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedxire 60(b) \"allows a party to seekrelief fcom a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under a limited set of circumstances\nincluding fraud, mistake, and newly discovered evidence.\" Gont^alei^ v. Crosbj, 545 U.S. 524, 528\n(2005). Rule 60(b) motions are addressed to the sound discretion of the tidal court, and are guided\nby accepted legal principles applied in light of aU relevant circumstances. See Pierce Assoc. Inc. v.\nNemours Found., 865 F.2d 530, 548 (3d Cir. 1988). Pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), a \"court may relieve a\nparty or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for ... newly discovered\nevidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new\ntidal under Rule 59(b).\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).\nIV. DISCUSSION\nIn his Rule 60(b)(2) Motion, Movant appears to allege that he requested the Third Circuit to\nissue \"subpoena[s] duces tecum\" requiring the following individuals to be deposed and/or produce\ncertain records: the private attorney from Philadelphia who represented him during his criminal\nproceeding in this Court; the Assistant Federal Public Defender of Delaware (\"Assistant PD of\nDelaware\") who represented him during his criminal proceeding in this Court; the former\naggravated homicide counsel from the Maryland Office of Public Defenders who witnessed a\nconversation in December 2011 among Movant, his private attorney from Philadelphia, and the\nAssistant PD of Delaware; and the Maryland attorney who represented him. (D.I. 61 at 2)\nMovant's Rule 60(b)(2) Motion appears to assert that these yet-to-be taken and/or yet-to-be\nprovided depositions and records constitute newly discovered evidence warranting the Court's\nreconsideration of its denial of his \u00a7 2255 Motion, presumably because they support the argument in\nhis \u00a7 2255 Motion that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to properly\ninvestigate and present his medical situation during sentencing. (D.I. 61 at 3)\nThe Court is not persuaded. First, Movant has not produced \"newly discovered evidence\"in any form to this Coxirt. Moreover, as stated ia the Court's Memorandum and Opinion denying\nMovant's \u00a7 2255 Motion, the evidence of record does not support the conclusion that defense\ncounsel performed deficiently in how he investigated and presented Movant's medical condition;\nwhile the record evidence does demonstrate that Movant was not prejudiced by defense counsel's\nactions. (D.L 51 at 5-7) Finally, when denying Movant's application for a certificate of\nappealability, the Third Circuit held that Movant did not make \"a substantial showing that it is\nreasonably probable that he would have received a lesser sentence had the Russian medical report\nand formal report prepared by the examioing psychologist been admitted iato evidence at\nsentencing . . ., nor [did he make] a substantial showtag that counsel coerced him into withdrawing\nhis appeal.\" (D.I. 60 at 1) Given these ckcumstances, the Court concludes that the instant Rule\n60(b)(2) Motion does not warrant reconsideration of the denial of Movant's \u00a7 2255 Motion.\nV. CONCLUSION\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the Court will deny the instant Rule 60(b)(2) Motion. The\nCoxirt also declines to issue a certificate of appealability because Movant has failed to make a\n\"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also United\nStates V, Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Ck. 1997); 3d Ck. LAR 22.2 (2011). A separate Order will be\nentered.\nFebruary 14, 2022 HONORABLE LEONARD P.
