Long, Jr. (\u201cMr. Long\u201d) filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n405(g) on October 7, 2020 against the defendant Kilolo Kijakazi, the Acting Commissioner of\nthe Social Security Administration (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d). (D.I. 1) Mr. Long seeks judicial\nreview of the Commissioner\u2019s February 4, 2020 final decision, denying Mr. Long\u2019s claim for\ndisability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title II of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-434. Currently before the court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed\nby Mr. Long and the Commissioner.? (D.I. 16; D.I. 18) Mr. Long asks the court to reverse the\nCommissioner\u2019s decision and remand for either payment of benefits or further administrative\n\nproceedings. (D.I. 17 at 20) The Commissioner requests that the court affirm the ALJ\u2019s\n\n1 Kilolo Kijakazi became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021.\nTherefore, pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Ms. Kijakazi is\nsubstituted as Defendant in place of Andrew Saul.\n\n2 The briefing for the present motions is as follows: Mr. Long\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 17), the\nCommissioner\u2019s combined opening brief in support of the motion for summary judgment and\nanswering brief in opposition to Mr. Long\u2019s motion (D.I. 19), and Mr. Long\u2019s answering brief in\nopposition to the Commissioner\u2019s motion and reply brief (D.I. 20).\ndecision. (D.I. 19 at 20) For the reasons set forth below, I recommend that the court DENY\nMr. Long\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 16), and GRANT the Commissioner\u2019s cross-\nmotion for summary judgment (D.I. 18).\nIl. BACKGROUND\nA. Procedural History\nMr. Long filed a DIB application on October 24, 2017, alleging a disability onset date of\nOctober 24, 2017 due to multiple conditions including a back injury, arthritis, diabetes, heart\ndisease, and human immunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d). (D.I. 10 at 201-02, 247) Mr. Long\u2019s\nclaims were initially denied on July 11, 2018, and they were denied again on reconsideration on\nDecember 14, 2018. (Ud. at 121-25, 132-34)\nAt Mr. Long\u2019s request, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on January\n15, 2020. (Id. at 33-72) The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision on February 4, 2020, finding\nthat Mr. Long was not disabled under the Act because he could perform a reduced range of light\nwork. (/d. at 24-32) The Appeals Council subsequently denied Mr. Long\u2019s request for review of\nthe ALJ\u2019s decision, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. (/d. at\n10-12)\nMr. Long brought this civil action challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision on October 7, 2020.\n(D.L. 1) Mr. Long filed a motion for summary judgment on May 10, 2021 (D.L. 16), and the\nCommissioner cross-moved for summary judgment on May 19, 2021 (D.L. 18). Briefing is now\n\ncomplete on the pending motions.\nB. Medical History\n1. Medical evidence\n\nMr. Long was 56 years old on October 24, 2017, his alleged disability onset date. (D.I.\n10 at 24) Mr. Long has a high school degree and two years of college, and he has past relevant\nwork as an accounting controller and a casino dealer. (/d. at 248, 308-10) The ALJ found that\nMr. Long had the following severe impairments: degenerative disc disease and coronary artery\ndisease status post stent placement. (/d. at 26) The focus of Mr. Long\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment is on the adequacy of the ALJ\u2019s assessment of limitations stemming from Mr. Long\u2019s\ndegenerative disc disease and mental conditions. (D.I. 17) Because Mr. Long does not\nchallenge the ALJ\u2019s decision regarding his HIV condition and heart condition, the court does not\naddress those conditions here.\n\n(a) Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine\n\nMr. Long has a history of lower back and leg pain. His primary care physician, Dr.\nAdam Rudnick, ordered an MRI of his lumbar spine in September 2017 after Mr. Long\nunderwent three to four weeks of physical therapy without improvement in his legs. (D.I. 11 at\n195-97, 206) The results of the MRI showed congenital spinal stenosis and nerve root\ncompression. (/d. at 198-99)\n\nOn November 3, 2017, Mr. Long underwent a neurosurgical consultation with Dr. Bikash\nBose, M.D. (Id. at 204) Dr. Bose reviewed the September 2017 MRI of Mr. Long\u2019s lumbar\nspine and performed a physical examination, which revealed mild tenderness on palpitation over\nthe lower lumbosacral spine and sciatic notches, with full motor strength in the upper\nextremities, negative straight leg raising test negative to 70 degrees bilaterally, and intact\n\npinprick sensation. (/d.) Dr. Bose found that Mr. Long had slightly reduced motor strength in\nseveral lower extremity motor groups and bilateral atrophy of his dorsal foot muscles. (/d.) Dr.\nBose recommended that Mr. Long either receive spinal injections or undergo a lumbar\ndiscectomy and fusion surgery. (Jd.)\n\nMr. Long also began receiving pain management treatment from Selina Xing, M.D. in\nNovember 2017. ( D.I. 12 at 243) Dr. Xing prescribed Tylenol with codeine and Lyrica to treat\nMr. Long\u2019s pain. (Jd. at 245) The following month, Mr. Long reported that he had a bad\nreaction to Lyrica and the Tylenol did not help mitigate his pain. (/d. at 239) Dr. Xing then\nprescribed Percocet to manage Mr. Long\u2019s pain. (/d. at 241) Dr. Xing\u2019s physical examinations\nfrom November 2017 through September 2019 consistently found that Mr. Long\u2019s gait and\nbalance were normal, he did not use an assistive device for ambulation, he had 5/5 strength in his\nbilateral lower extremities, slightly reduced bilateral hip abduction and adduction, negative\nstraight leg raising tests, reduced bilateral reflexes, and slightly reduced lumbar extension. (D.I.\n12 at 227, 231, 234, 237, 243, 388, 392, 396, 400, 404; D.I. 13 at 98, 101, 105, 109, 113, 117,\n120, 123, 127, 131)\n\nMr. Long received bilateral selective nerve root block injections in August 2018 and\nMarch 2019. (D.I. 12 at 407; D.I. 13 at 95) After each injection, Mr. Long reported temporary\nimprovement in his pain levels and his physical exam results remained unchanged. (D.I. 12 at\n391-92; D.I. 13 at 117) Mr. Long continued to manage his pain with Percocet following the\nprocedure, and a physical examination on September 12, 2019 did not indicate any change from\nhis previous condition. (D.I. 13 at 97, 98)\n\n(b) Mental conditions\nMr. Long began treatment with therapist Lawrence S. Yurow in January 2015, after he\n\nwas fired from the job he had held for more than twenty years. (D.I. 13 at 187) Mr. Long\npresented with sadness, crying spells, loss of interest in activities, psychomotor retardation,\nsleeplessness, lack of energy, social withdrawal, hopelessness, and recurrent thoughts of death.\n(Id.) Mr. Yurow diagnosed Mr. Long with depressive disorder and made no changes to his\nprescriptions for Xanax and Ambien. (/d. at 187-88) Mr. Long\u2019s depressive disorder remained\nunchanged at subsequent appointments in July and September 2015. (/d. at 189, 192)\n\nAt follow up appointments in April and December 2016, Mr. Yurow indicated that Mr.\nLong\u2019s depression was in partial remission. (/d. at 193, 197) Mr. Long reported that he was not\nexperiencing any of his previous symptoms except for occasional sadness and loss of meaning\nand purpose for life. (Jd.) During the December 2016 visit, Mr. Yurow also indicated Mr. Long\nexperienced a compulsion to perform repetitive actions and thoughts that harm will befall his\nfamily. (id. at 197)\n\nMr. Long sought treatment at Harmonious Mind, LLC on August 31, 2017, where Fawzia\nHasan, M.D. diagnosed him as having major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,\nand provisional insomnia disorder. (D.I. 11 at 226) Mr. Long\u2019s Mental Status Exam (\u201cMSE\u201d) at\nthis time was normal in all areas, with the exception of his anxious and depressed mood. (Jd.)\nDr. Hasan continued Mr. Long\u2019s prescription for Xanax, but on a smaller dosage with the intent\nto taper off use. (/d. at 288) Dr. Hasan also prescribed Remeron for insomnia, but discontinued\nthe prescription in March 2018 after Mr. Long reported having nightmares. (D.I. 11 at 288; D.I.\n12 at 264)\n\nMr. Long had fifteen subsequent meetings with Dr. Hasan between August 31, 2017 and\nOctober 10, 2019. (D.I. 12 at 260-65, 276-78; D.I. 13 at 148, 151, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164,\n166) The MSEs from each of these meetings consistently reported the same diagnoses and\n\nfindings: normal results in each category with the exception of Mr. Long\u2019s anxious and\ndepressed mood. (/d.) Dr. Hasan continued Mr. Long\u2019s prescription for Xanax and added a\nprescription for Cymbalta in June 2019. (D.I. 13 at 160, 164, 166) In March 2019, Dr. Hasan\nidentified a mild cannabis use disorder. (Jd. at 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166)\n\nOn two occasions in October 2019, Mr. Long returned to Mr. Yurow with complaints of\nanger, irritability, sadness, and occasional crying spells, as well as general social alienation and\nisolation. (/d. at 199, 203) Mr. Yurow observed that Mr. Long appeared anxious and agitated\nwith rapid speech, consistent with his diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. (/d. at 199-200,\n203) Mr. Yurow indicated that Mr. Long\u2019s anxiety was mostly episodic. (Id. at 204) Mr. Long\ncontinued to complain of significant anxiety symptoms in December 2019, but he also described\nhis efforts to improve his interpersonal communications and family relationships. (Jd. at 207)\n\n2. Medical opinions\n\nOn July 8, 2018, Mr. Long\u2019s record was reviewed by state agency physician Christopher\nKing, Psy.D., who concluded that Mr. Long did not have a severe mental impairment and was\ncapable of maintaining appropriate social behavior based on the stability of his condition\nthroughout his progress notes. (D.I. 10 at 92) A second review of Mr. Long\u2019s psychiatric record\nwas conducted by state agency physician Thomas Fink, Ph.D., on November 27, 2018. (dd. at\n112) Mr. Fink concurred with Dr. King\u2019s findings and opined that Mr. Long\u2019s mental\nimpairments appeared non-severe. (Id.)\n\nIn August 2019, Mr. Long\u2019s physical therapist, Carina Rodriguez, performed a Residual\nFunctional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment and concluded that Mr. Long could work at a sedentary\nto light level for two to four hours with changes in position to manage his pain. (D.I. 13 at 90,\n92) Ms. Rodriguez also opined that Mr. Long could tolerate standing, sitting, and walking\n\noccasionally, and that he could safely lift up to 25 pounds occasionally. (/d.) Dr. Xing\nconcurred with Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s opinion on August 21, 2019. (/d. at 93)\n\nOn December 20, 2019, Mr. Yurow conducted a Psychological Functional Capacity\nevaluation of Mr. Long and concluded that his generalized anxiety disorder and strong features\nof depressive personality would prevent him from performing simple, repetitive work 40 hours a\nweek without missing more than two days of work per month due to deficits in his attention,\nconcentration, and memory. (D.I. 13 at211) Mr. Yurow indicated that Mr. Long had\nmoderately severe impairments in his ability to sustain work performance and attendance and\ncope with the pressures of ordinary work; moderate impairments in his ability to relate to others,\nmaintain personal habits, and perform repetitive tasks under ordinary supervision; and mild\nimpairments in his ability to perform activities of daily living and understand and carry out\nsimple instructions under ordinary supervision. (Jd. at 212-13)\n\nC. Hearing Before the ALJ\n\n1. Mr. Long\u2019s Testimony\n\nAt the administrative hearing on January 15, 2020, Mr. Long testified that he previously\nworked as an accounting controller and currently works as a part-time casino dealer. (D.I. 10 at\n45-52) Mr. Long\u2019s position as an accounting controller required him to be on his feet 30% of the\ntime and infrequently lift objects weighing up to 50 pounds. (Jd. at 48-49) Mr. Long\u2019s position\nas a part-time casino dealer is mostly sedentary and requires lifting no more than 10 pounds. (/d.\nat 46) After briefly working as a full-time casino dealer in 2017, Mr. Long took a leave of\nabsence and was subsequently terminated because his leg and lumbar pain made it difficult for\nhim to physically sustain full-time employment. (/d.) Mr. Long\u2019s positions as an accounting\ncontroller and as a casino dealer required a high level of social interaction and some\n\nmathematical proficiency. (/d. at 47-52)\nMr. Long testified that he lives in a house with his daughter and two grandchildren. (Id.\nat 53) He described how his pain limited his ability to drive for extended periods of time, and he\nfelt frustrated that the pain left him unable to play or interact with his grandchildren. (Id. at 54)\nAs a result of his pain, Mr. Long explained that he spends most of his time at home on the couch\nwith his legs elevated. (Jd. at 60)\n\nMr. Long testified that he takes Percocet, which generally reduces his pain levels from an\n\u201ceight\u201d to a \u201cfour or five,\u201d although its effectiveness has diminished over time. (/d. at 61-62)\nHe also testified that his lumbar injections relieved his pain for only a few days after each\nprocedure. (/d.) Due to his heart condition and the potential risks, Mr. Long declined to pursue\nsurgery. (/d.) Mr. Long reported that he used marijuana infrequently to help manage his pain\nand mental anguish. (/d. at 70)\n\nMr. Long also testified that he sought treatment for depression in 2014 to address his\nextreme weight loss, feelings of helplessness, lack of motivation, social irritability, and\nexhaustion. (Id. at 62-64) Mr. Long stated that his treating therapist, Mr. Yurow, encouraged\nhim to undergo further neuropsychological testing after he began having memory issues that\nimpacted his ability to perform his job as a casino dealer. (Jd. at 65) Mr. Yurow also\nrecommended a procedure to help stabilize Mr. Long\u2019s emotional outbursts and hysterical crying\nfits. (Id. at 67)\n\n2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ\n\nAt the administrative hearing in January 2020, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical\nto vocational expert Adina Leviton (\u201cthe VE\u201d):\n\n[P]lease assume an individual of the Claimant\u2019s age, education and experience.\n\nSuch an individual is able to perform sedentary work; occasionally climbs ramps\n\nand stairs; and never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; occasionally balance,\nstoop, kneel, crouch, crawl; tolerate occasional exposure to extreme heat, extreme\ncold, humidity, wetness, vibrations, fumes, odors, dust, gases, poor ventilation,\nvibrations, and hazards such as moving machinery or unprotected heights.\n\n(D.I. 10 at 72-73) In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the VE testified that such a hypothetical\nindividual could perform the controller job per DOT, but not as actually performed, nor could the\nindividual perform the casino dealer job. (/d. at 73) The ALJ then adjusted the hypothetical and\nasked whether such an individual could perform the casino dealer job according to the conditions\ndescribed by Mr. Long. (Jd. at 73-74) The VE testified that such an individual could perform\nthe job according to Mr. Long\u2019s description of his part-time position because it was a sedentary\nposition and did not require lifting more than 10 pounds. (/d.) However, the VE testified that\nsuch an individual would not be able to perform the tasks required of a full-time casino dealer\nbecause it required standing for one hour per shift and lifting up to 25 pounds. (/d. at 74) Ifthe\nhypothetical were adjusted to require the individual to move between seated and standing\npositions for five minutes every hour, the VE opined that the individual could perform the job, so\nlong as the individual\u2019s changes in position could be done at the work station. (/d. at 74-75)\n\nMr. Long\u2019s counsel then asked the VE to consider whether any of the past work would be\navailable if the hypothetical individual were limited to working less than forty hours a week.\n(Id.) The VE responded that Mr. Long\u2019s past work would not be available to the hypothetical\nindividual on a full-time basis. (/d.) The VE also confirmed that Mr. Long\u2019s past work would\nnot be available if the hypothetical individual were limited to simple, routine, or unskilled work.\n(id.) The VE explained that there would no longer be work if the hypothetical individual had a\nloss of productivity greater than 15 to 20% and consistent absences one or more days per month.\n(Id. at 76)\n\nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings\n\nBased on the factual evidence in the record and the testimony by Mr. Long and the VE,\nthe ALJ determined that Mr. Long was not disabled under the Act for the relevant time period\nbeginning on October 24, 2017. (D.I. 10 at 26-32) The ALJ found, in pertinent part:\n\n1. The claimant meets the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act\nthrough March 31, 2023.\n\n2. The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since October 24,\n2017, the alleged onset date (20 CFR 404.1571 et seq.).\n\n3. The claimant has the following severe impairments: degenerative disc disease;\nand coronary artery disease, status-post stent placement (20 CFR\n404.1520(c)).\n\n4. The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that\nmeets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(d), 404.1525 and\n404.1526).\n\n5. After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the\nclaimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined\nin 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except occasionally climb ramps, stairs; never climb\nladders, ropes, scaffolds; occasionally balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl;\ntolerate occasional exposure to extreme cold, extreme heat, humidity,\nvibrations, fumes, odors, dust, gases, poor ventilation, hazards.\n\n6. The claimant is capable of performing past relevant work as an accounting\ncontroller and casino dealer. This work does not require the performance of\nwork-related activities precluded by the claimant\u2019s residual functional\ncapacity (20 CFR 404.1565).\n\n7. The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security\nAct, from October 24, 2017, through the date of this decision (20 CFR\n404.1520(f)).\n\n(I. 10 at 26-32)\nIl. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nJudicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial\n\nevidence supports the decision.? See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); Biestek v. Berryhill, 139\n\n31In this case, Mr. Long also argues that the ALJ made a series of legal errors in the decision.\n(See, e.g., D.I. 17 at 3 n.1) The Third Circuit has recognized that the court may assess whether\n\n10\nS. Ct. 1148, 1154 (2019). \u201cSubstantial evidence means enough relevant evidence that \u2018a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d\u201d Pearson v. Comm'r of Soc.\nSec., 839 F. App\u2019x 684, 687 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154). When applying\nthe substantial evidence standard, the court \u201clooks to an existing administrative record and asks\nwhether it contains \u2018sufficien[t] evidence\u2019 to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d\nBiestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).\nThe threshold for satisfying the substantial evidence standard is \u201cnot high[,]\u201d requiring \u201cmore\nthan a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. Id.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Disability Determination Process\n\nTitle II of the Act affords insurance benefits to people who contributed to the program\nand who have a disability. See Pearson, 839 F. App\u2019x at 687 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)). A\ndisability is the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically\ndeterminable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which\nhas lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is only disabled if the impairments are so severe that they\npreclude a return to previous work or engagement in any other kind of substantial gainful work\nexisting in the national economy. Jd. at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 21-22\n\n(2003). To qualify for disability insurance benefits, a claimant must establish disability prior to\n\nthe Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. See Friedberg v. Schweiker, 721 F.2d\n445, 447 (3d Cir. 1983). Courts exercise plenary review of legal issues and review the ALJ\u2019s\nfindings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. Schaudeck v.\nComm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 181 F.3d 429, 431 (3d Cir. 1999) (internal citations omitted).\n\n11\nthe date last insured. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.131 (2016); Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611-12 (3d\nCir. 2014).\n\nThe Commissioner must perform a five-step analysis to determine whether a person is\ndisabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 427-28 (3d Cir. 1999). If\nthe Commissioner makes a finding of disability or non-disability at any point in the sequential\nprocess, the Commissioner will not review the claim further. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). At\nstep one, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant is engaged in any substantial\ngainful activity. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is not engaged in substantial\ngainful activity, step two requires the Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is\nsuffering from a severe impairment or a severe combination of impairments. See id. at \u00a7\n404.1520(a)(4)(ii).\n\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, at step three, the Commissioner compares the\nclaimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments that are presumed severe enough to preclude any\ngainful work. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. When a claimant\u2019s\nimpairment or its equivalent matches a listed impairment, the claimant is presumed disabled. See\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). If a claimant\u2019s impairment, either singly or in combination, fails\nto meet or medically equal any listing, the analysis continues to steps four and five. See id. at \u00a7\n404.1520(e).\n\nAt step four, the ALJ considers whether the claimant retains the residual functional\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv); Plummer, 186\nF.3d at 428. A claimant\u2019s RFC \u201cmeasures the most she can do despite her limitations.\u201d Zirnsak\n\nv. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1)) (internal\n\n12\nquotations and alterations omitted). The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating the inability\nto return to past relevant work. See Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428.\n\nIf the claimant is unable to return to past relevant work, at step five, the Commissioner\nmust demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s impairments do not preclude an adjustment to any other\navailable work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. In other words, the\nCommissioner must prove that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the\nnational economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments, age,\neducation, past work experience, and [RFC].\u201d Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. The ALJ must\nanalyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he or she\nis capable of performing work and is not disabled. See id. The ALJ often seeks the VE\u2019s\nassistance in making this finding. See id.\n\nB. Whether the ALJ\u2019s Decision is Supported by Substantial Evidence\n\nMr. Long\u2019s motion for summary judgment focuses on three overarching issues: (1)\nwhether the ALJ failed to incorporate Mr. Long\u2019s credible mild mental limitations in the RFC\nfinding and the hypothetical question; (2) whether the ALJ properly applied the de minimis\nseverity standard to Mr. Long\u2019s mental impairments; and (3) whether the ALJ erred in her\nevaluation of Mr. Long\u2019s lumbar impairment.\n\n1. Consideration of Mr. Long\u2019s credible mental limitations\n\nMr. Long argues that the ALJ erred by failing to adopt mild mental limitations she found\ncredible at step two in her RFC finding or her hypothetical question. (D.I. 17 at 2-8) According\nto Mr. Long, the ALJ\u2019s error is not harmless because Mr. Long\u2019s past relevant work was skilled,\nand the omission of a mild mental functional limitation is legal error when the issue involves\n\nperforming skilled work or work that requires a high reasoning level. (/d. at 5-6)\n\n13\nIn response, the Commissioner asserts that the ALJ was not required to account for Mr.\nLong\u2019s mild mental limitations in her RFC assessment because the record did not support any\nwork restrictions stemming from the mild mental limitations. (D.I. 19 at 11) The Commissioner\nfurther alleges that any error in the ALJ\u2019s analysis of Mr. Long\u2019s mental limitations at step four\nwas harmless, noting that Mr. Long did not identify any additional mental limitations that are\nwarranted by the record evidence. (/d. at 13-14)\n\nThe ALJ did not err in failing to incorporate limitations associated with Mr. Long\u2019s\nmental impairments in the RFC assessment and hypothetical question posed to the VE.\nAlthough an ALJ must consider limitations imposed by all of an individual\u2019s impairments, both\nsevere and non-severe, when making their RFC assessment, there is no requirement that an ALJ\nmust find or include limitations associated with mild impairments. See Smith v. Comm\u2019r of Soc.\nSec., 2016 WL 3912850, at *9 (D.N.J. July 19, 2016) (concluding that the ALJ did not err in\ndeclining to include mental limitations in the RFC because he clearly considered the plaintiffs\ndepression and concluded that the symptoms did not significantly limit her basic work activities).\nIndeed, the Third Circuit has explained that broad findings of limitations at step two of the\nsequential evaluation should not cloud the substance of the ALJ\u2019s overall review, including how\nwell the ALJ understood the record and the claimant\u2019s specific impairments before making an\nRFC determination. See Holley v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 590 F. App\u2019x 167, 168 (3d Cir. 2014)\n(rejecting the claimant\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred by failing to tell the VE she had moderate\ndifficulties in concentration, persistence, and pace).\n\nAt step two of the sequential analysis, the ALJ considered Mr. Long\u2019s mental\nimpairments and found that Mr. Long did not have more than mild, non-severe, limitations in\n\nfour areas of the \u201cparagraph B\u201d mental functional analysis codified at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n\n14\n404.1520a(c)(3): (1) understanding, remembering, and applying information, (2) interacting with\nothers, (3) concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace, and (4) adapting or managing oneself.\n(D.I. 10 at 28) The ALJ\u2019s conclusion was based on her consideration of the record, which\nindicated that Mr. Long\u2019s mental conditions were managed with medication, his mental status\nexams consistently revealed normal findings, and he was able to live with his daughter and\nmaintain part-time employment at a casino. (Jd. at 27) The ALJ was persuaded by the State\nagency psychological consultants, who concluded that Mr. Long had only non-severe mental\nimpairments with no mental limitations based on the medical evidence of record showing normal\nmental status exam findings. (/d.) Evidentiary support for Mr. Long\u2019s mild mental limitations\nwas limited to the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit Mr. Long\u2019s testimony and subjective reports. (Jd. at\n28) These considerations confirm that the ALJ had sound knowledge of the entire record and\nunderstood the impact of Mr. Long\u2019s mental impairments before determining Mr. Long\u2019s RFC.\nSee Shaffer v. Colvin, 2014 WL 4925067, at *5 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 2014) (\u201cIt is clear from the\nrecord that the ALJ adequately considered all of the relevant medical evidence, as well as\nplaintiff's reported activities, in assessing plaintiffs residual functional capacity, and that he\nincorporated into his finding all of the limitations that reasonably could be supported by the\nmedical and other relevant evidence.\u201d); McCafferty v. Astrue, 2008 WL 1869282, at *4 (E.D. Pa.\nApr. 25, 2008) (finding that the requirements of SSR 96-8p were satisfied by ALJ\u2019s narrative\ndiscussion of the claimant\u2019s functional limitations in the context of the objective medical\nevidence, doctors\u2019 notes and opinions, the claimant\u2019s activities of daily living, and the claimant\u2019s\nsubjective complaints).\n\nMr. Long objects to the ALJ\u2019s recitation of boilerplate language to explain how she\n\nfactored Mr. Long\u2019s mental impairments into the RFC at step four of the sequential analysis:\n\n15\nThe limitations identified in the \u201cparagraph B\u201d criteria are not a residual\n\nfunctional capacity assessment but are used to rate the severity of mental\n\nimpairments at steps 2 and 3 of the sequential evaluation process. The mental\n\nresidual functional capacity assessment used at steps 4 and 5 of the sequential\n\nevaluation process requires a more detailed assessment. The following residual\n\nfunctional capacity assessment reflects the degree of limitation the undersigned\n\nhas found in the \u201cparagraph B\u201d mental function analysis.\n(DL. 10 at 28) But recent case law addressing nearly identical language supports the\nCommissioner\u2019s position that the step four RFC analysis adequately reflected the ALJ\u2019s thorough\nanalysis of the mental limitations at step two. See Brumfield v. Saul, 2020 WL 4934315, at *5-6\n(E.D. Pa. Aug. 21, 2020). As in Brumfield, it was reasonable for the ALJ in this case not to\ninclude work-related limitations in the RFC based on Mr. Long\u2019s mild mental impairments\nbecause \u201c[s]uch a finding is consistent with the substance of the analysis done at step two.\u201d Id.\nat *6; see Hess v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 931 F.3d 198, 209 (3d Cir. 2019) (\u201c[N]o incantations are\nrequired at steps four and five simply because a particular finding has been made at steps two\nand three.\u201d). Because Mr. Long\u2019s mild mental impairments did not translate into work-related\nlimitations, the ALJ\u2019s failure to explicitly discuss those impairments in the RFC analysis does\nnot amount to an error. See Wardell v. Berryhill, C.A. No. 18-918-RGA, 2019 WL 1579501, at\n*6-7 (D. Del. Apr. 12, 2019) (upholding the ALJ\u2019s determination that mild mental limitations not\nimpacting the claimant\u2019s ability to function need not be included in the hypothetical posed to the\nVE or the RFC assessment).\n\nMr. Long relies on the Middle District of Pennsylvania\u2019s decision in Kich v. Colvin, 218\nF. Supp. 3d 342 (M.D. Pa. 2016), in support of his position that the ALJ erred by omitting mild\nfunctional limitations based on the paragraph B criteria from the RFC finding where, as here, Mr.\n\nLong\u2019s past relevant work was skilled in nature. (D.I. 17 at 5) But the decision in Kich noted\n\nthat the ALJ mischaracterized the evidence of record in some respects by suggesting there was\n\n16\nno evidence of in-office panic attacks, when in fact, the claimant\u2019s provider had completed a\nquestionnaire confirming the claimant\u2019s in-office panic attacks. Kich, 218 F. Supp. 3d at 359.\nHere, in contrast, there is no suggestion that the ALJ\u2019s discussion of the evidence on this issue\nwas not supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, the court\u2019s focus in Kich was on the\nproper procedure to evaluate a substance abuse disorder, and there is no indication that an RFC\nof skilled versus unskilled work was determinative. See Valdez v. Berryhill, 2017 WL 5988652,\nat *3 (D. Colo. Dec. 4, 2017) (discussing Kich, 218 F. Supp. 3d 342). An ALJ is \u201cnot required to\nincorporate any particular functional limitation in the RFC based on [the] Step Two findings of\nmild limitations in social functioning and concentration, persistence, and pace,\u201d so long as the\nrecord shows the ALJ considered the mental limitations. See Taylor v. Berryhill, 2018 WL\n3887521, at *6 (E.D. Mich. July 5, 2018) (rejecting the holding in Kich). For these reasons, Mr.\nLong\u2019s reliance on Kich is not persuasive.\n\nEven if the ALJ\u2019s step four analysis was incomplete, any error was harmless. Mr. Long\ndisagrees with the ALJ\u2019s omission of the mild mental impairments from the RFC and\nhypothetical question posed to the VE, yet he does not state what additional mental limitations\nare warranted by the evidentiary record. (D.I. 17 at 7-13) As noted by the ALJ, Mr. Long\u2019s\nmental status exams were within normal limits, he was able to maintain part-time work as a card\ndealer in a casino, he was able to drive, he had no problem maintaining appropriate grooming\nhabits, and he lived with his daughter and grandchildren. (D.I. 10 at 28) Where, as here, there is\nlimited evidence to support work-related limitations stemming from the claimant\u2019s mental\nimpairments, courts within this Circuit have found that any error in the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is\n\nharmless. See Brumfield, 2020 WL 4934315, at *7-8.\n\n17\nMr. Long contends that the ALJ\u2019s alleged error cannot be harmless because his past\nrelevant work involved skilled positions, and even mild mental impairments would limit his\nability to perform such work. (D.I. 17 at 5-6) But courts have rejected this same argument. See\nValdez, 2017 WL 5988652, at *3 (\u201cThe court [in Kich] never discussed, much less held, that the\nALJ\u2019s finding that the claimant had an RFC for skilled work as opposed to unskilled work was\ndeterminative in its review of [the] claim.\u201d). Moreover, the record supports a conclusion that\nMr. Long could perform his past work despite his mild mental conditions. Specifically, Mr.\nLong was working part-time as a casino dealer during his period of disability even though the\nposition required a high level of functioning in the paragraph B criteria.* (DI. 10 at 27-28) The\nevidence does not suggest that Mr. Long\u2019s limitations in concentration, memory, interacting with\nothers, and managing himself had any impact on his ability to perform work as a casino dealer.\n(Id. at 28)\n\n2. Application of the de minimis severity standard to Mr. Long\u2019s mental\nimpairments\n\nMr. Long argues that the ALJ erred in her application of the de minimis severity standard\nat step two of the sequential evaluation process by: (1) mischaracterizing Mr. Long\u2019s testimony;\n(2) relying on outdated State agency opinions; and (3) failing to articulate meaningful reasons\nfor rejecting Mr. Yurow\u2019s opinion. (D.I. 17 at 8)\n\nThe Commissioner maintains that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s de minimis\n\nfinding because Mr. Long\u2019s part-time work as a casino dealer, his mental status examination\n\n4 Mr. Long subsequently argues that his part-time work as a casino dealer is not inconsistent with\nthe impact his mental functional limitations have on his ability to work full-time. (D.I. 17 at 12)\nNonetheless, the fact that any limitations in Mr. Long\u2019s concentration, memory, ability to\ninteract with others, and ability to manage himself did not preclude him from maintaining work,\npart-time or otherwise, in a skilled position lends support to the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\n\n18\nresults, and his living situation confirmed his abilities under the \u201cparagraph B\u201d criteria. (D.I. 19\nat 14-15) The Commissioner argues that the ALJ provided adequate reasons for rejecting the\nopinion of Mr. Yurow because it was inconsistent with Mr. Yurow\u2019s own treatment records, the\nresults of Mr. Long\u2019s mental status examinations, and Mr. Long\u2019s continued ability to work as a\npart-time casino dealer. (/d. at 15-16)\n\nAt step two of the sequential analysis, the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of Mr. Long\u2019s mental\ncondition was supported by substantial evidence indicating that Mr. Long\u2019s depression and\nanxiety were non-severe impairments. The ALJ considered Mr. Long\u2019s mental health records\ndating back to 2015, observing that Mr. Long\u2019s depression and anxiety were managed with\nmedication and his mental status exam findings were consistently within normal limits in the\ntime period between August 2017 and October 2019. (D.I. 10 at 27) The ALJ also accurately\nreported that more recent mental health records document significant anxiety symptoms relating\nto Mr. Long\u2019s relationship with his daughter, but by Mr. Long\u2019s own account, his depression\nimproved after he returned to work. (/d.) The ALJ\u2019s decision is consistent with Mr. Long\u2019s\ntestimony about his return to work: \u201c[O]nce I was able to start working again, that gave me \u2014 that\nwith the therapy helped me out of a situation that I felt like I was in a big, black hole, that I\nwasn\u2019t going to get out of.\u201d (/d. at 63) Accordingly, the administrative record contains\nsufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s factual determination regarding the severity of Mr.\nLong\u2019s mental impairments. Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154.\n\nMr. Long argues that the ALJ mischaracterized his testimony about his interpersonal\nconflict with his daughter, suggesting that the ALJ incorrectly presumed that their cohabitation\nindicated they were not in conflict. (D.I. 17 at 9-10) But Mr. Long ignores critical aspects of the\n\nALJ\u2019s reasoning on this point. The ALJ acknowledged that \u201c[rJecent mental health records note\n\n19\nsignificant anxiety symptoms relating to interpersonal conflict the claimant is having with his\ndaughter,\u201d but she concluded that \u201cthis is inconsistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony that he is\nmoving in with his daughter and he continues to work part-time at a casino. The claimant also\ntestified that his depression improved after he was able to start working again.\u201d (D.I. 10 at 27)\nThe ALJ\u2019s decision focused not only on Mr. Long\u2019s living situation, but also on Mr. Long\u2019s\nsuccessful transition to part-time work as a casino dealer, a job that requires extensive social\ninteraction, and the improvements in his mental condition resulting from his return to work. The\nALJ\u2019s analysis is supported by the record, which includes testimony from Mr. Long that it is\nimportant for his mental health to do something productive, and his difficulties with social\ninteraction stem in part from his frustration with being dependent and unable to work. (D.I. 10 at\n64-65) Mr. Yurow\u2019s treatment notes further indicate that the timing of Mr. Long\u2019s remission and\nimproved functioning coincided with his part-time employment as a casino dealer, and his\ndepression and anxiety were \u201cnot interfering with his ability to function.\u201d (DI. 13 at 195, 197)\n\nMr. Long incorrectly accuses the ALJ of assuming that removal of a single stressor\nwould \u201ccompletely eradicate\u201d Mr. Long\u2019s mental impairments. (D.I. 17 at 10) The ALJ\u2019s\ndecision states that Mr. Long\u2019s recent treatment with Mr. Yurow \u201cfocused on anxiety due to a\ndifficult interpersonal interaction with his daughter,\u201d which is consistent with Mr. Yurow\u2019s own\ntreatment records identifying symptoms of \u201canger, irritability, sadness, and occasional crying\nspells\u201d in addition to general social alienation \u201c[flollowing a difficult interpersonal interaction\nwith his daughter.\u201d (D.I. 13 at 199) Contrary to Mr. Long\u2019s representation, the ALJ does not\nclaim that Mr. Long\u2019s anxiety and depression would be \u201ccompletely eradicated\u201d if his conflict\nwith his daughter were resolved. (D.I. 10 at 27)\n\nMr. Long\u2019s position that the ALJ improperly relied on outdated State agency opinions is\n\n20\nalso misplaced. First, the record reflects that Mr. Long was represented by counsel at his\nadministrative hearing, but no request was made to obtain an updated State agency opinion or\nkeep the administrative record open. Courts within the Third Circuit have held that it is\nprimarily the duty of counsel to develop the record in these circumstances. See Johnson v.\nComm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2021 WL 2661544, at *8 (E.D. Pa. June 29, 2021) (emphasizing that\ncounsel has a duty to request an updated State agency opinion at the administrative hearing\nbecause the ALJ has \u201cno enhanced duty to develop the administrative record\u201d when the claimant\nis represented by counsel); see also Turby v. Barnhart, 54 F. App\u2019x 118, 122-23 (3d Cir. 2002)\n(holding that the ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the record \u201cis most acute where the claimant is\nunrepresented[.]\u201d).\n\nSecond, the record establishes that Mr. Yurow\u2019s most recent treatment notes post-dating\nthe State agency opinions were generally consistent with both contemporaneous mental\ntreatment records and treatment records that pre-dated the State agency opinions. The ALJ\nfound that the 2018 State agency opinions were supported by mental exam findings within\nnormal limits during the time period between August 2017 and October 2019. (D.I. 10 at 27)\nFor example, notes from an October 10, 2019 session with Dr. Hasan reveal normal mental status\nexam results in the areas of psychomotor activity, thought content, perceptual functioning,\nattitude, insight, judgment, attention/concentration, and impulse control. (D.I. 13 at 166) The\n\u201cmore recent\u201d records from Mr. Yurow are dated between October 3 and December 3, 2019.\n(DI. 17 at 11; D.I. 13 at 199, 203-04, 207-08) Those records include mental status exam results\nin which Mr. Long exhibited agitation and anxiousness, but his appearance, cognition, attention,\nmemory, concentration, and insight were normal. (/d.) In notes from the October 16, 2019 visit,\n\nMr. Yurow observed that \u201c[t]he patient does appear to be benefiting from both psychotropic\n\n21\nmedication and his use of coping skills,\u201d and Mr. Long reported that he could function very well\nand manage his symptoms with his increased coping skills. (D.I. 13 at 204) This evidence is\nneither remote in time nor divergent in content, and there is no indication that the record lacked\nsufficient evidence for the ALJ to make a well-informed decision regarding the severity of Mr.\nLong\u2019s mental impairments.\n\nFinally, Mr. Long\u2019s argument that the ALJ failed to adequately articulate her reasons for\nrejecting Mr. Yurow\u2019s medical opinion is without merit. (D.I. 17 at 12) The ALJ found Mr.\nYurow\u2019s opinion unpersuasive \u201cbecause it is not supported by his treatment records, and is\ninconsistent with the prior administrative medical findings and evidence of stable mental exam\nfindings.\u201d (D.I. 10 at 27) These reasons for rejecting Mr. Yurow\u2019s opinion are fully supported\nby the record. As Mr. Long explains in his briefing, Mr. Yurow opined that Mr. Long has\n\u201cmoderately severe limitations related to personal care habits, sustaining attendance in full time\nwork, and coping with ordinary work pressures,\u201d as well as an inability to remain on task for\n80% of the workday. (D.I. 17 at 12; D.I. 13 at 211-213) These opinions are inconsistent with\nMr. Yurow\u2019s own treatment notes, which consistently confirm that Mr. Long is \u201c[a]ppropriately\ndressed and groomed\u201d and remains \u201c[a]lert and oriented\u201d in the areas of cognition, attention,\nmemory, and concentration. (D.I. 13 at 199, 203-04) Mr. Yurow\u2019s treatment notes further\nidentify Mr. Long\u2019s psychosocial strengths to include communication skills and problem-solving\nskills. (Jd. at 200, 204) The record also confirms that Mr. Yurow\u2019s opinion is inconsistent with\na series of mental status examinations in which Mr. Long exhibited normal findings. (D.I. 12 at\n260-265, 276-278; D.I. 13 at 148, 151, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166)\n\nThe ALJ further noted the temporal gap in Mr. Yurow\u2019s treatment of Mr. Long and the\n\nnarrow scope of his more recent treatment, which was limited to episodic bouts of anxiety\n\n22\nresulting from his difficult relationship with his daughter. (D.I. 10 at 27) These reasons for\ndiscounting the persuasiveness of Mr. Yurow\u2019s opinion are also supported by the administrative\nrecord, which confirms that Mr. Long had a four-year gap in treatment with Mr. Yurow from\n2015 to 2019. (D.I. 13 at 199) (\u201cPatient presents back for reevaluation he is known to me from 4\nyears ago, when we engaged in a course of therapy for his depressive symptoms.\u201d). The ALJ\u2019s\ndescription of the scope of Mr. Yurow\u2019s treatment appears to be derived directly from Mr.\nYurow\u2019s own treatment notes, which explain that \u201c[t]he symptoms of anxiety are mostly\nepisodic, and occur with ruminations and obsessive thoughts about his predicament. At other\ntimes the patient reports that he functions very well.... At these times symptoms are generally\nminimal and manageable with his increased coping skills.\u201d (Jd. at 204) Consequently,\nsubstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Mr. Yurow\u2019s opinion.\n\n3. Evaluation of Mr. Long\u2019s lumbar impairment\n\nMr. Long challenges the ALJ\u2019s determination that his lumbar impairment did not meet\nListing 1.04, arguing that she ignored extensive evidence in the record and failed to clearly\narticulate her finding that the impairment did not meet or equal a listing. (D.I. 17 at 13-17) In\nresponse, the Commissioner contends that Mr. Long failed to satisfy his burden of showing that\nhe met all the criteria of Listing 1.04. (D.I. 19 at 17)\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s decision that Mr. Long\u2019s lumbar impairment does not meet or equal a listing is\nsupported by substantial evidence. \u201cFor a claimant to show that his impairment matches a\nlisting, it must meet ai/ of the specified medical criteria. An impairment that manifests only\nsome of those criteria, no matter how severely, does not qualify.\u201d Sullivan v. Zebley, 493 U.S.\n\n521, 530 (1990). To meet Listing 1.04A,\u00b0 Mr. Long was required to prove that he had a disorder\n\n5 Mr. Long concedes that his condition does not satisfy Listing 1.04B or C.

In this case, the ALJ concluded that Mr. Long\u2019s degenerative disc disease\ndid not meet Listing 1.04A after a review of his September 2017 MRI results and office\ntreatment records from Dr. Xing indicating that Mr. Long had a normal gait and did not require\nthe use of an assistive device. (D.I. 10 at 28)\n\nThere is no dispute that Mr. Long\u2019s MRI results showed evidence of nerve root\ncompression. (D.I. 19 at 18; D.I. 11 at 198-99, 205) Nonetheless, Mr. Long\u2019s medical records\nsupport the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that his lumbar spine impairment did not satisfy all of the medical\ncriteria of Listing 1.04A. Specifically, the evidence considered by the ALJ shows that Mr. Long\ndid not have positive straight-leg raising test results in both the sitting and supine positions. A\nstraight-leg raise test is positive if pain is produced between 30 and 70 degrees. See Jemison v.\nSaul, 2020 WL 7258515, at *5 n.18 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 10, 2020); see also Jenkins v. Comm\u2019r of Soc.\nSec., 192 F.

But Dr. Bose\u2019s treatment notes from Mr. Long\u2019s visit on November 3, 2017 indicate\nthat Mr. Long\u2019s \u201c[s]traight leg raising test is free to 70\u00b0 bilaterally when there is hamstring\ntightness.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 205); see Jenkins, 192 F. App\u2019x at 119. Dr. Xing\u2019s treatment records\n\nfrom November 2017 to September 2019 also consistently revealed negative straight-leg raising\n\n24\ntest results. (D.I. 12 at 227, 231, 234, 237, 243, 388, 392, 396, 400, 404; D.I. 13 at 98, 101, 105,\n109, 113, 117, 120, 123, 127, 131) Notably, Mr. Long\u2019s reply brief does not direct the court to\nany portion of the administrative record showing that Mr. Long had the requisite positive\nstraight-leg raising test results in accordance with the criteria of Listing 1.04A. (D.L. 20 at 5-6)\n\nRelying on the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling in Burnett v. Commissioner of Social Security, 220\nF.3d 112, 119-20 (3d Cir. 2000), Mr. Long takes issue with the manner in which the ALJ\nassessed his lumbar impairment, arguing that the ALJ erred in mentioning or assessing Mr.\nLong\u2019s nerve root compression. (D.I. 17 at 16-17; D.I. 20 at 5) But the Third Circuit has since\nclarified that \u201cBurnett does not require the ALJ to use particular language or adhere to a\nparticular format in conducting his [step three] analysis. Rather, the function of Burnett is to\nensure that there is sufficient development of the record and explanation of findings to permit\nmeaningful review.\u201d Jones v. Barnhart, 364 F.3d 501, 505 (3d Cir. 2004). Here, the ALJ\u2019s\ndiscussion of Mr. Long\u2019s degenerative disc disease expressly acknowledges that Mr. Long\u2019s\n\u201cstraight leg raising test is free up to 70 degrees bilaterally when there is hamstring tightness.\u201d\nD.I. 10 at 30) This finding is sufficient to rule out satisfaction of the Listing 1.04A criteria. See\nDoran, 2014 WL 4660055, at *4 (emphasizing that all criteria of nerve root compression must be\nmet to satisfy Listing 1.04A). Applying Jones, the ALJ\u2019s failure to use the phrase \u201cnerve root\ncompression\u201d is not error because the ALJ sufficiently developed the record and explained her\nfindings in this case. Jones, 364 F.3d at 505.\n\nMr. Long also argues that the ALJ did not adequately support her rejection of the medical\nopinion of Dr. Xing, a treating physician. (D.I. 17 at 17-19) According to Mr. Long, the ALJ\nimproperly focused on his conservative treatment regimen, normal gait, and absence of a need\n\nfor an assistive device, and she misconstrued his stable exam findings to suggest that he was not\n\n25\nimpaired. (Jd.) In response, the Commissioner contends that the ALJ\u2019s assessment of Dr. Xing\u2019s\nopinion was adequately supported by evidence in the administrative record showing that Mr.\nLong received only conservative treatment for his pain, and his gait and strength were normal.\n(D.L 19 at 19-20)\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision finding Dr. Xing\u2019s opinion\nunpersuasive based on inconsistencies with the pain management records and other medical\nevidence of record. (D.I. 10 at 32) The administrative record indicates that Mr. Long initially\nrejected Dr. Bose\u2019s treatment recommendations of either nerve root block injections or fusion\nsurgery, instead opting to control his symptoms with medication alone until ultimately pursuing\ninjections in August 2018 and March 2019. (D.I. 11 at 204, 241; D.I. 12 at 407; D.L. 13 at 95)\nThe ALJ was entitled to consider Mr. Long\u2019s rejection of recommended courses of treatment in\nfavor of more conservative measures in finding Dr. Xing\u2019s opinion unpersuasive. See, e.g.,\nHutchins v. Astrue, 2012 WL 995274, at *1 n.1 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 23, 2012) (finding the ALJ\nappropriately considered the claimant\u2019s pursuit of only conservative treatment while ignoring\nrecommendations to undergo surgery); Niglio v. Colvin, 2013 WL 2896875, at *10 (W.D. Pa.\nJune 13, 2013) (crediting ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s \u201clack of follow-through with treatment\nrecommendations [w]as evidence that her impairment was not as severe as alleged.\u201d). Moreover,\nthe ALJ appropriately considered evidence of Mr. Long\u2019s normal gait and full or good strength\nand found them to be inconsistent with Dr. Xing\u2019s opinion regarding Mr. Long\u2019s functional\nlimitations and pain level. (D.I. 10 at 32; D.I. 13 at 92); see Bartmas v. Saul, 2020 WL 1061473,\nat *5 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 5, 2020) (concluding that the ALJ properly found medical evidence to be\ninconsistent with complaints of disabling pain where the claimant \u201cexhibited normal gait, full or\n\ngood strength, minimal fatigue, fairly mild symptoms, and normal range of motion.\u201d).\n\n26\nThe role of this court is not to reweigh the evidence, but to determine whether ALJ\u2019s\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence. Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154. Because the ALJ\u2019s\ntreatment of Dr. Xing\u2019s opinion and her analysis of the listing criteria were supported by\nexplanation and were consistent with substantial evidence in the record as a whole, I recommend\nthat the court deny Mr. Long\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this issue.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court DENY Mr. Long\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment (D.I. 16), and GRANT the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary\njudgment (D.I. 18).\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objection and responses to the objections are limited to ten (10)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage v. Barnhart, 171 F.
