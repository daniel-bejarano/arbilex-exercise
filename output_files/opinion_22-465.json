Brodie, CARL TON \nFIELDS, P.A., Miami, Florida \nCounsel for Defendants \nNovember 8, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION COLMF.COOl.i y \nCHIEF JUDGE \nPlaintiff Arthrex, Inc. filed this breach of contract case against Defendants \nNational Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. and Federal Insurance \nCompany. D.I. 1 at 1-2. Arthrex alleges that Defendants' refusal to reimburse it \nfor costs it incurred in responding to government investigative subpoenas and in \nsettling a qui tam lawsuit filed in Massachusetts violates the terms of certain \ninsurance policies. D.I. 1 ,r 144-45. Pending before me is Defendants' motion to \ntransfer the case to the Middle District of Florida. D.I. 18. Because Defendants \nhave shown that, on balance, the convenience of the patties and witnesses and the \ninterests of justice strongly favor transfer, I will grant the motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nArthrex is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in the \nMiddle District of Florida. D.l. 17 ,r 5; D.I. 20 at 3. National Union is a \nPennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in New York. D.I. 17 \n,r 6. Federal Insurance is an Indiana corporation with its principal place of business \nin New Jersey. D.I. 17 ,r 7. \nIn early 2020, an Assistant United States Att01ney from the U. S. Attorney's \nOffice in Massachusett s served on Arthrex two subpoenas in connection with the \ngovernment's ongoing investigation of Arthrex for potential \"federal healthcare offenses.\" D.I. 1-4 at 389; D.I. 1-5 at 397. The first subpoena was served in \nJanuary via email to Arthrex's headquarters in Florida. D.I. 22-2 at 651. The \nsecond subpoena was served on an Arthrex attorney in Massachusetts. D.I. 22-2 at \n651. The subpoenas demanded the appearance of an Arthrex witness at the U.S. \nAttorney's Office in Fort Myers, Florida, or alternatively the production of \ndocuments mailed to the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's Office. D.I. 1-4 at 389; \nD.I. 1-5 at 397. \nIn early February 2020, Joseph B. Shea filed a qui tam lawsuit against \nArthrex in the District of Massachusetts. See United States ex rel. Joseph B. Shea \nv. Arthrex, Inc., No. 20-10210 (D. Mass. dismissed Feb. 11, 2022). On November \n4, 2021, Arthrex reached a settlement with the United States to resolve the \ngovernment's investigation and Shea's lawsuit. D.I. 1-6 at 407. Arthrex thereafter \nasked Defendants to reimburse it for the fees and costs it incurred in responding to \nthe subpoenas and the qui tam lawsuit and the amount Arthrex paid to the United \nStates in connection with the settlement. D.I. 1 ,r,r 34-35. Defendants have \nrefused at least in part Arthrex's coverage demand. D.I. 1-8 at 423; D.I. 1-9. \nThe parties engaged unsuccessfully in nonbinding mediation, after which \nArthrex filed this suit on April 9, 2022. D.I. 22 at 4. The next day, Defendants \nfiled a declaratory judgment action in the Middle District of Florida, seeking a \njudgment that Arthrex was not entitled to the coverage it demanded. D.I. 22 at 4; \n2 National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Arthrex, Inc., No. 22-226 (M.D. Fla. Apr. \n10, 2022). That suit is effectively a mirror image of this action. \nArthrex moved in the Florida case to transfer that action to this District. No. \n22-226, D.I. 28. Judge Chappell, who is overseeing the Florida case, noted that the \nFlorida case and this case should probably be consolidated and heard by a single \njudge. D.I. 25-1 at 3--4. Rather than \"rush out an order and risk inconsistent \nrulings on the same transfer issue,\" Judge Chappell stayed the Florida case and \ndeferred to me to rule in the first instance on the transfer question. D.I. 25-1 at 4-\n5. \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. Legal Standards \nDefendants ask me to transfer this case to the Middle District pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). D.I. 18. That section provides that \"[t]or the convenience of the \nparties and witnesses, in the interests of justice, a district court may transfer any \ncivil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\" 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). Arthrex does not dispute that this action might have been \nbrought in the Middle District. D.I. 20 at 8-9; D.I. 22. Therefore, the only issue \nbefore me is whether I should exercise my discretion under\u00a7 1404(a) to transfer \nthis action. (As neither defendant is from Delaware or Florida and the amount in \n3 controversy is over $75,000, I have subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.) \nDefendants have the burden \"to establish that a balancing of proper interests \nweigh[s] in favor of the transfer.\" Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 25 \n(3d Cir. 1970). This burden is heavy. \"[U]nless the balance of convenience of the \nparties is strongly in favor of [the] defendant[ s], the plaintiff's choice of forum \nshould prevail.\" Id. ( emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \nAlthough there is \"no definitive formula or list of the factors to consider\" in \na transfer analysis, the Third Circuit identified in Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 \nF.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995), 12 interests \"protected by the language of\u00a7 \n1404(a).\" Id. Six of those interests are private: \n[ 1] plaintiff's forum preference as manifested in the \noriginal choice; [2] the defendant's preference; [3] \nwhether the claim arose elsewhere; [4] the convenience \nof the parties as indicated by their relative physical and \nfinancial condition; [5] the convenience of the \nwitnesses-but only to the extent that the witnesses may \nactually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and [ 6] \nthe location of books and records (similarly limited to the \nextent that the files could not be produced in the \nalternative forum). \nId. ( citations omitted). The other six interests are public in nature: \n[7] the enforceability of the judgment; [8] practical \nconsiderations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, \nor inexpensive; [9] the relative administrative difficulty \n4 in the two fora resulting from court congestion; [10] the \nlocal interest in deciding local controversies at home; \n[11] the public policies of the fora; and [12] the \nfamiliarity of the trial judge with the applicable state law \nin diversity cases. \nId. at 879-80 ( citations omitted). \nArthrex argues that when a transfer motion is filed in one of two parallel \nactions in different federal district courts, a \"relevant factor\" to be considered in \naddition to the 12 interests identified in Jumara is the so-called \"first-filed rule.\" \nD.I. 22 at 6. That rule \"gives a court 'the power' to enjoin the subsequent \nprosecution of proceedings involving the same parties and the same issues already \nbefore another district court.\" E.E. 0. C. v. Univ. of Pennsylvania, 850 F .2d 969, \n971 (3d Cir. 1988), ajf'd, 493 U.S. 182 (1990). This \"power,\" however, \"is not a \nmandate directing wooden application of the rule .... \" Id. On the contrary, \n\"[a]pplication of the rule is discretionary.\" Id. As the Court held in Chavez v. \nDole Food Co., Inc., 836 F.3d 205 (3d Cir. 2016) (in bane), \"the first-filed rule is \ngrounded on equitable principles and requires district court judges to fashion a \nflexible response to the issue of concurrent jurisdiction.\" Id. at 216 ( cleaned up). \n5 B. Analysis of the Juma,ra Factors \n1. Plaintiff's Forum Preference \nThis factor is of paramount importance and therefore weighs strongly \nagainst transfer. VLSI Tech. LLC v. Intel Corp., 2018 WL 5342650, at *4 (D. Del. \nOct. 29, 2018). \n2. Defendant's Forum Preference \nThis factor favors transfer. \n3. Whether the Claim Arose Elsewhere \nNone of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in Delaware. And \nalthough it is not clear from the record if Arthrex issued its coverage demand from \nFlorida or received Defendants' rejection of that demand in Florida, it is \nundisputed that the parties' dispute is about coverage for expenses that Arthrex \nincurred in part in Florida. D.I. 20 at 13. Accordingly, this factor favors transfer. \n4. The Convenience of the Parties as Indicated by Their \nRelative Physical and Financial Condition \nThis factor is neutral. No party has a physical presence in Delaware. \nArthrex is located in Florida but does not concede that Florida is a more \nconvenient forum for it. D.I. 22 at 11-12. Defendants' offices are in New York \nand New Jersey, and thus closer to Delaware, but they do not concede that \nDelaware is a more convenient forum for them. D.I. 24 at 6. All three parties are \nnational corporations and none of the parties argues that it cannot bear the cost of \n6 litigating in either forum. D.I. 22 at 11-12; D.I. 24 at 6. \n5. The Convenience of Witnesses \nThis factor is neutral. Under Third Circuit law, the district court is to \nconsider the convenience of witnesses \"only to the extent that the witnesses may \nactually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora.\" Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879; see \nalso Smart Audio Techs., LLC v. Apple, Inc., 910 F. Supp. 2d 718, 732 (D. Del. \n2012) (noting that this factor applies only insofar as \"a witness actually will refuse \nto testify absent a subpoena\"). Neither party alleges that any witness will be \nunavailable for trial, but each can name one non-employee witness who falls \nwithin the subpoena power of their chosen forum. D.I. 20 at 15; D.I. 22 at 14. \n6. The Location of Books and Records \nThis factor is neutral. Jumara instructs me to give weight to the location of \nbooks and records only \"to the extent that the files [ and other documentary \nevidence] could not be produced in the alternative forum.\" 55 F.3d at 879. \nNeither party alleges that the books and records in this action could not be \nproduced in either forum. D.I. 20 at 16-17; D.I. 22 at 14. \n7. The Enforceability of the Judgment \nThe parties agree that this factor is neutral. D.I. 20 at 17; D.I. 22 at 14. \n7 8. Practical Considerations \nJumara instructs me to give weight to \"practical considerations that could \nmake the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive.\" 55 F.3d at 879. Although I did \nnot consider economic cost and logistical inconvenience of potential party \nemployee witnesses when I assessed factors 4 and 5, it is appropriate to consider \nthese issues in assessing \"practical considerations.\" See Paycom, 2022 WL \n1063845, at *5; Mite/ Networks Corp. v. Facebook, Inc., 943 F. Supp. 2d 463, \n475-76 (D. Del. 2013). \nDefendants argue that this factor favors transfer because Delaware's only \nconnection to the lawsuit is as Arthrex' s state of incorporation, whereas Arthrex is \nheadquartered in Florida, many of the likely witnesses live there, and relevant \ndocuments are located there. D.I. 20 at 17. Arthrex responds that if this action is \ntransferred, Arthrex will be forced to amend the pleadings in the Florida action and \nwill have to comply with certain procedural requirements to assert a bad faith \nclaim that it has alleged in this case. D.I. 22 at 15. \nThough transferring the case will present additional work for Arthrex in the \nshort-term, in the long term it will minimize travel costs and logistical \ninconvenience for the potential employee witnesses located near Arthrex' s \nheadquarters in Florida. Accordingly, this factor favors transfer. \n8 9. Relative Administrative Difficulty Due to Court Congestion \nThis factor strongly favors transfer. According to the most recent data \nprovided by the United States Courts, the weighted case filings per active \njudgeship in this District between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 were 873. \nSee U.S. District Courts-Combined Civil and Criminal Federal Court \nManagement Statistics (June 30, 2022), ADMIN. OFF. OF THE U.S. CTS., \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/na/federal-court-management\u00ad\nstatistics/2022/06/30-2. By comparison, the weighted case filings per active \njudgeship in the Middle District of Florida for that period were 570 and the \nnational weighted case filings per active judgeship were 501. Notably, these \nstatistics do not take into consideration the availability of senior judges to help \nactive judges handle their caseloads. Delaware has no senior judges; whereas the \nMiddle District has 14, see About the Judges, U.S. DIST. CT. MIDDLE DIST. OF FLA., \nhttps://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/judges/district (last visited Nov. 7, 2022). Given \nthese statistics, it is not surprising that the median time from the filing of a civil \ncase to trial in the Middle District is 29 .9 months as compared to 36 months in this \ndistrict. U.S. District Courts, supra. \n10. Local Interest in Deciding Local Controversies at Home \nIt is undisputed that Arthrex is headquartered in Florida and that Defendants \ndo business in Florida and are subject to oversight by the Florida Office of \n9 Insurance Regulation. D.I. 20 at 19-20. Thus, Florida has a local interest in this \naction. \nArthrex argues that \"when a Delaware corporation is involved, Delaware has \nan interest in resolving the dispute.\" D.I. 22 at 16. Arthrex cites, and I know of, \nno authority that supports this proposition where the dispute is in federal court and \nnot between Delaware corporations. In any event, I agree with Judge Noreika that \n\"[a]lthough Delaware clearly has a public policy interest in the capabilities and \nconduct of officers and directors of Delaware corporations, this public policy is not \ndirectly related to insurance coverage disputes.\" Ceradyne, Inc. v. RLI Ins. Co., \n2021 WL 3145171, at *9 (D. Del. July 26, 2021). \nAccordingly, this factor favors transfer. \n11. Public Policies of the Fora \nArthrex argues that \"Florida and Delaware have directly opposing public \npolicies impacting this litigation.\" D.I. 22 at 17; see also D.I. 22 at 18 (\"[T]he \npublic policies of Florida and Delaware conflict in a manner impacting \ncoverage.\"); D.I. 22 at 19 (arguing that the parties' \"contractual arrangement itself \ntriggers Delaware's public policy in support of freedom of contract and expressly \nsubordinates Florida's separate public policy\" against the insurability of certain \ntypes of losses). Defendants do not dispute this assertion. Accordingly, this factor \nis neutral. \n10 12. Familiarity of the Trial Judges with the Applicable State \nLaw in Diversity Cases \nThe parties agree that this factor is neutral. D.I. 20 at 21; D.I. 22 at 19. \n13. Summary of Factors \nIn sum, of the 12 Jumara factors, five weigh in favor of transfer ( one of \nthem strongly in favor), one weighs against transfer (and is to be given paramount \nimportance), and six are neutral. Considered in their totality, the factors weigh \nstrongly in favor of transfer to the Middle District of Florida. \nC. The First-Filed Rule \nArthrex asks me to woodenly apply the first-filed rule to deny Defendants' \nmotion based on Arthrex' s filing of this action the day before Defendants filed the \nFlorida action. D.I. 22 at 6-8. I will, however, exercise my discretion and not \napply the rule under the circumstances present here. \"[T]he rule's primary \npurpose[ s] [are] to avoid burdening the federal judiciary and to prevent the judicial \nembarrassment of conflicting judgments.\" E.E. 0. C., 850 F .2d at 977. Neither \npurpose would be served by application of the rule here. Judge Chappell stayed \nresolution of Arthrex' s transfer motion to avoid the risk of inconsistent judgments; \nand she has made it clear that if I transfer this case to Florida, she will consolidate \nthe cases and thereby conserve judicial resources. D.I. 25-1 at 3-5. As application \nof the Jumara factors makes clear, the convenience of the parties and witnesses \n11 and the interests of justice are better served if this case is transferred to Florida. \nThus, a transfer of the case is warranted under\u00a7 1404(a). \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, I will grant Defendants' motion to transfer \nthe case to the Middle District of Florida. \n12 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nARTHREX, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nNATIONAL UNION FIRE \nINSURANCE COMPANY OF \nPITTSBURGH, PA. and FEDERAL \nINSURANCE COMPANY, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 22-00465-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington on this Eighth day of November in 2022: \nFor the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion issued this day, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that that Defendants ' Motion to Transfer Pursuant To 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (D.I. 18) is GRANTED .
