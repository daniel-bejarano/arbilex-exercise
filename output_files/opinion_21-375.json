Lyons, BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP, Wilmington, Delaware; Daniel \nGoettle, BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \nCounsel for Petitioner \nKaren Elizabeth Keller, Nathan Roger Hoeschen, SHAW KELLER LLP, \nWilmington, Delaware \nCounsel for Respondent \nMay 26, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION cciLM:coNNOLL y \nCHIEF JUDGE \nPending before me is an application filed by Syngenta Crop Protection AG \n(Syngenta) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 for an order authorizing it to serve a \nsubpoena on Sharda USA LLC seeking discovery for use in a future litigation in \nIndia. D.I. 3 at 1. Sharda opposes the application. D.I. 15. \nI. BACKGROUND \nSyngenta seeks discovery for use in an Indian patent infringement lawsuit \nthat it plans to file \"upon receipt of the information from [Sharda].\" D.I. 3 at 1. \nSyngenta explains that the dispute arises from GSP Crop Science Private Limited \nof India's (GSP) manufacturing of the pesticide thiamethoxam in violation of a \nSyngenta patent claiming methods of synthesizing thiamethoxam. D.I. 3 at 1. \nSyngenta believes that GSP supplies thiamethoxam to Sharda, and thus Syngenta \nanticipates that Sharda \"possesses information that will assist in establishing GSP' s \ninfringement[.]\" D.I. 3 at 1. Syngenta represents that it has been \"pursuing a \nparallel path corresponding with GSP\" to \"obtain the necessary evidence and \ndocumentation required by the Indian court to substantiate the initial pleading and \nrequest for interim injunction.\" D.I. 3 at 2-3. Syngenta asserts that it has been \nunable to obtain the information from GSP and thus seeks it here from Sharda. \nD.I. 3 at 3. II. LEGAL STANDARD \nA district court has authority to grant an application under\u00a7 1782 when \nthree statutory conditions are met: ( 1) the person from whom discovery is sought \n\"resides or is found\" within the district; (2) the discovery is \"for use in a \nproceeding before a foreign or international tribunal\"; and (3) the application is \nmade by an \"interested person.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a); see also In re Bayer AG, \n146 F.3d 188, 193 (3d Cir. 1998). \nIf the statutory conditions are satisfied, the decision to grant a \u00a7 1782 \napplication lies within the district court's discretion. Intel Corp. v. Advanced \nMicro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241, 264 (2004). The Court identified in Intel four \nfactors relevant to that discretionary determination: ( 1) whether the person from \nwhom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding; (2) the nature \nof the foreign tribunal, the character of the foreign proceedings, and the receptivity \nof the foreign government to federal judicial assistance; (3) whether the request \nconceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other \npolicies; and ( 4) whether the request is unduly intrusive or burdensome. Id. at \n264-65. \"A court should apply these factors in support of\u00a7 1782's 'twin aims' of \n'providing efficient assistance to participants in international litigation and \nencouraging foreign countries by example to provide similar assistance to our \n2 courts.\"' In re Biomet Orthopaedics Switzerland GmBh, 7 42 F. App 'x 690, 696 \n(3d Cir. 2018) ( quoting Intel, 542 U.S. at 252). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nSharda does not dispute that the statutory requirements are satisfied here but \nargues that I should use my discretion to deny the application because the Intel \nfactors favor denial. D.I. 15 at 5. Regarding the first Intel factor, Sharda does not \ndispute that it is not a participant in the foreign proceeding. D.I. 15 at 5 n.4. Thus, \nthe first factor favors granting the application. \nI consider the second factor to be neutral. Syngenta submits a declaration \nfrom a lawyer in India representing that there is no indication from the Indian \ngovernment that assistance from this Court would be \"unwelcome.\" D .I. 5 ,I 7. \nSharda faults Syngenta for not presenting more compelling evidence in support of \nthe second fact, but, as the party opposing discovery, Sharda \"bear[ s] the burden \n[of] demonstrating offense to the foreign jurisdiction.\" In re Chevron Corp., 633 \nF.3d 153, 162 (3d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nBecause Sharda has offered no evidence suggesting that the Indian court would not \nbe receptive to this Court's assistance, I will accept Syngenta's representation. \nThat said, I am not convinced that the factor entirely favors granting the \napplication. The second factor also permits consideration of the \"character of \nproceedings underway abroad[.]\" Intel, 542 U.S. at 244. In Intel, the Court \n3 explained that a proceeding does not need to be imminent or pending but that it \nmust be within \"reasonable contemplation.\" Id. at 259. I am not convinced that \nthe proceeding here meets that requirement. Syngenta repeatedly explains that it \nmust \"provide as much relevant evidence of infringement and the imminence of \nharm as possible to the court\" to request an interim injunction. D.I. 3 at 3; see also \nD.I. 3 at 3 (\"Syngenta's application is a good faith effort to obtain discovery \nnecessary to support its claim for an interim injunction[.]\"); D.I. 3 at 7 (\"Because \nof the nature of the relief being sought by Syngenta[-]an interim injunction, \nrequires proof and supporting evidence early in the case, engaging in the slow \nprocess of seeking third-party discovery from Sharda through the Hague \nConvention[] is not practicable in these circumstances.\"); D.I. 3 at 8 (The \ndiscovery requests \"are narrowly focused on gathering evidence to support \nSyngenta's goal of obtaining an interim injunction in the foreign proceeding.\"). \nBut, in its opposition, Sharda represents that Syngenta's patent expired in \nOctober 2021, so, it argues, the court would be unlikely to grant an injunction. D.I. \n15 at 1-2. Syngenta does not dispute that the patent has expired nor does it refute \nthe argument that it is unlikely to get an injunction for an expired patent. See \ngenerally D.I. 17. Rather, it argues that the information is also relevant to past \ninfringement of its patent and \"estab,lishing that [infringing] products have already \nbeen sold[.]\" D.I. 17 at 7. Although this theory seems plausible, Syngenta's initial \n4 insistence of its need for the requested discovery to obtain an injunction coupled \nwith its lack of response to Sharda's patent expiration argument makes me \nquestion whether Syngenta has reasonably contemplated this potential proceeding. \nFor this reason, I find that this factor is neutral. \nThe third factor weighs in favor of denial. Syngenta argues that it is not \ntrying to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions by seeking discovery \nthrough this Court but rather that it seeks discovery here because it must \naccompany its pleadings in the future Indian proceeding with documentary \nevidence to obtain injunctive relief. D.I. 3 at 7-8. Given Syngenta's lack of \nresponse to the patent expiration argument, I give little weight to this injunction \nargument. Setting that argument aside, this application appears to be an attempt to \nsubstitute this Court's discovery rules for Indian discovery rules: Syngenta does \nnot dispute that GSP has access to the information that it requests from Sharda, so I \nam left questioning why Syngenta came to this Court to get information from \nSharda rather than go through the Indian court and employ Indian discovery rules \nto get the same information from GSP unless it did so to circumvent less favorable \ndiscovery rules. \nUltimately, it is the fourth factor that weighs heaviest in favor of denial. \nSyngenta describes its requests as \"small in number and scope\" and \"narrowly \nfocused\" on Sharda's possession ofthiamethoxam products. D.I. 3 at 8. Although \n5 all the deposition topics are limited to thiamethoxam, only two of the nine topics \nare limited to GSP' s thiamethoxam; the rest of the topics broadly cover all \ninformation related to any thiamethoxam without any time restrictions. D.I. 4-2 at \n7-8. Syngenta's document requests are similarly largely untethered to GSP. D.I. \n4-2 at 9-10. Syngenta offers no reason it needs information regarding \nthiamethoxam manufactured by entities other than GSP or why it would need \ninformation pertaining to the time period after the patent's expiration. D.I. 17 at 7-\n8. Thus, I find the requested discovery is intrusive to Sharda's business \nrelationships with entities that Syngenta has not alleged are infringing its patent, \nburdensome for Sharda because the requests are not limited to a specific time \nperiod or, for the most part, to a specific entity, and largely irrelevant to the dispute \nbetween Syngenta and GSP. In short, this application appears to be a fishing \nexpedition into a nonparty' s affairs, and this factor strongly favors denial. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAlthough Syngenta has met the statutory requirements for a \u00a7 1782 \napplication, I suspect that Syngenta may be using \u00a7 1782 to circumvent Indian \ndiscovery rules and find the discovery requests burdensome and intrusive. Thus, I \nfind the Intel factors on the whole favor denial of the application, and accordingly I \nwill exercise my discretion to deny the application. \n6 "}
