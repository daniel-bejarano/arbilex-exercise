Counsel for Defendant Biniam Hirut Debabe. \nFebruary 23, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Tolessa Gurmessa , who proceeds prose, filed this action on action on \nJune 17, 2021. (D.I. 1). The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. \nBefore the Court are Defendants' motions to dismiss, Defendant Biniam Hirut Debabe's \nmotion for leave to file an amended motion to dismiss, and Plaintiff's responsive letter \nconstrued as a motion to voluntarily dismiss Debabe. (D.I. 8, 12, 17, 24). Briefing is \ncomplete. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff alleges defamation by Defendants on April 10, 2021, when \"Defendants ' \nletter to Plaintiff's employer and coworkers, falsely accused him of serious crimes. It \nalso operates to accuse Plaintiff of committing crimes under Delaware law, as well as \nthe law of numerous other states, in that it effectively states that Plaintiff openly \nsupports genocide , glorifies torture, lynching, massacre, ethnic cleansing. \" (D.I. 1 at ,I \n17; see D.I. 1-1 at 2-4). Plaintiff alleges there is \"absolutely no basis to support or make \nthese serious accusations ,\" and the statements are \"false and defamatory. \" (Id.). \nPlaintiff alleges Defendants sent the letter to at least seven of Plaintiff's coworkers ; \nDefendants knew that the false and disparaging statements would be read by Plaintiff's \ncoworkers ; and Plaintiff would be subjected to termination of his employment as the \nletter urged the \"VA to reassess his fitness to work for a government's organization \ntreating and carrying patriots fighting for freedom and against terrorists. \" (Id.). Plaintiff \nalleges that the false statements are defamation per se because the statements \ncharged him with supporting serious crimes against humanity and committing crimes \nunder the law. (Id. at ,I 20). Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages. \n1 All Defendants move to dismiss.1 (D.I. 8, 12). Debabe filed a motion for leave to \nfile an amended motion to dismiss and, in response , Plaintiff filed a letter motion to \nvoluntarily dismiss without prejudice the claims against Debabe . (D.I. 17, 24). \nDefendants Genocide Prevention in Ethiopa, Inc. and Senaid Senay move for dismissal \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) on the grounds that this Court lacks \npersonal jurisdiction over Senay and the Complaint fails to state a defamation claim. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Rule 12(b)(2) \nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the Court may \ndismiss a suit for lack of jurisdiction over the person. Although Rule 8 does not require \na plaintiff to set forth in the complaint \"the grounds upon which the court has personal \njurisdiction over the defendant ,\" Hansen v. NeumuellerGmbH , 163 F.R.D. 471,474 (D. \nDel. 1995), \"once a defendant has raised a jurisdictional defense, a plaintiff bears the \nburden of proving by affidavits or other competent evidence that jurisdiction is proper.\" \nDayhoff Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co., 86 F.3d 1287, 1302 (3d Cir. 1996). If the district court \ndoes not hold an evidentiary hearing, the court should resolve any factual disputes in \nthe plaintiffs favor and should deny the motion if the plaintiffs evidence establishes \"a \nprima facie case of personal jurisdiction .\" Eurofins Pharma US Holdings v. BioAl/iance \nPharma SA, 623 F.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir. 2010). \nTwo requirements , one statutory and one constitutional , must be satisfied for \npersonal jurisdiction to exist over a defendant. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. v. C & C \n1 Biniam Hirut Debabe's motion was filed when he proceeded prose. He has since \nretained counsel. \n2 Helicopter Sales, Inc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 400, 403 (D. Del. 2002). \"First, a federal district \ncourt may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the state in which the court \nsits to the extent authorized by the law of that state.\" Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)). \nThe Court must, therefore , determine whether there is a statutory basis for jurisdiction \nunder the Delaware long-arm statute. Id. (citing 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104(c)). \"Second, \nbecause the exercise of jurisdiction must also comport with the Due Process Clause of \nthe United States Constitution , the Court must determine if an exercise of jurisdiction \nviolates [Defendant 's] constitutional right to due process.\" Id. (citing International Shoe \nCo. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310 (1945)). \n\"Once a jurisdictional defense has been raised, the plaintiff bears the burden of \nestablishing with reasonable particularity that sufficient minimum contacts have \noccurred between the defendant and the forum state to support jurisdiction .\" Id. (citing \nProvident Nat'/ Bank v. California Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 819 F.2d 434,437 (3d Cir. \n1987). Plaintiff may establish jurisdictional facts through sworn affidavits or other \ncompetent evidence . See Time Share Vacation Club v. Atlantic Resorts, Ltd., 735 F.2d \n61, 66 n.9 (3d Cir. 1984). \nPlaintiff must demonstrate either specific or general jurisdiction. Specific \njurisdiction arises when the particular cause of action arose from Defendant's activities \nwithin the forum state. In contrast, general jurisdiction does not require Defendant 's \nconnections be related to the particular cause of action, but that Defendants have \ncontinuous or systematic contacts with the forum state. American Bio Medica Corp. v. \nPeninsula Drug Analysis Co, Inc., 1999 WL 615175 (D. Del. 1999). \"[A]t no point may a \nplaintiff rely on the bare pleadings alone in order to withstand a defendant 's Rule \n3 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of in personam jurisdiction .\" Id. Plaintiff is required \nto respond to a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction with \nactual proof, not mere allegations. Id. See also Hurley v. Cancun Playa Oasis ln'tl \nHotels, 1999 WL 718556, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 1999) (stating that \"[g]eneral \naverments in an unverified complaint or response without the support of sworn affidavits \nor other competent evidence are insufficient to establish jurisdictional facts \"). \nB. Rule 12(b)(6) \nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \nplaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds \nprose, his pleading is liberally construed and his complaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, \nmust be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Id. \nA court may consider the pleadings , public record, orders, exhibits attached to the \ncomplaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference . Tellabs, Inc. v. \nMakar Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be \ngranted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and \nviewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant , a court concludes that \nthose allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \n\"Though 'detailed factual allegations ' are not required, a complaint must do more \nthan simply provide 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of \na cause of action.\"' Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,241 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). I am \"not required to credit bald assertions or legal \n4 conclusions improperly alleged in the complaint. \" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. \nUtig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed , however, \n\"for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted .\" Johnson v. \nCity of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014). \nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \"substantive \nplausibility. \" Id. at 347. That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"A claim has facial plausibility when the \n[complainant] pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the [accused] is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. Deciding whether \na claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to \ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. at 679. \n\"In deciding motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), courts generally \nconsider only the allegations in the complaint , exhibits attached to the complaint , \nmatters of public record, and documents that form the basis of a claim. A document \nforms the basis of a claim if the document is 'integral to or explicitly relied upon in the \ncomplaint. ' The purpose of this rule is to avoid the situation where a plaintiff with a \nlegally deficient claim that is based on a particular document can avoid dismissal of that \nclaim by failing to attach the relied upon document. Further, considering such a \ndocument is not unfair to a plaintiff because, by relying on the document , the plaintiff is \non notice that the document will be considered .\" Lum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217 n.3 \n(3d Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted); see also In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. \nUtig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). \n5 Ill. DISCUSSION \nA. Dismissal of Debabe \nDebabe filed a prose motion to dismiss. (D.I. 8). He retained counsel who filed \na motion for leave to file an amended motion to dismiss. (D.I. 17). In response , Plaintiff \nwrote a letter to the Court that states, \"In light of the motion to dismiss filed by co\u00ad\ndefendants Genocide Prevention in Ethiopa Inc. and Senait Senay [], I have changed \nmy mind regarding the dismissal of Mr. Debabe from this action.\" (D.I. 14 at 1 ). Plaintiff \ngoes on to state that he does not \"strongly object\" to Debabe's dismissal from this \naction and he reserves the right to add him back as a defendant if his involvement is \ndiscovered. (/d.). Debabe replies that he does not object to his dismissal without \nprejudice. (D.I. 29). I construe the responsive letter (D.I. 14) as a motion to voluntarily \ndismiss Debabe pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41. \nAccordingly , Debabe's motion to dismiss and motion for leave to file an amended \nmotion to dismiss will be dismissed as moot. Plaintiff's responsive letter, construed as a \nmotion to voluntarily dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41, will be granted. \nB. Personal Jurisdiction \nSenay and Genocide Prevention move to dismiss Senay on the grounds that this \nCourt lacks personal jurisdiction over Senay. They argue that the Complaint lacks facts \nto support a claim of minimum contacts to satisfy Delaware 's long arm statute or due \nprocess as there are no allegations that Senay had any contact with Delaware. Plaintiff \nresponds that Senay is/was the agent, principal, stakeholder and/or alter ego of \nGenocide Prevention and that this Court also has personal jurisdiction over Senay \nunder 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104(c)(4) . Plaintiff states that Senay has possibly transacted and/or \n6 done business in the State of Delaware . (0.1. 26 at 4-6). Plaintiff states that Senay is \npossibly the sole officer of Genocide Prevention , which Plaintiff asserts would establish \npersonal jurisdiction under Delaware 's officer consent statute, 10 Del. C \u00a7 3114. (Id. at \n6-9). He also seeks jurisdictional discovery . (Id. at 17). \nThis Court may permit \"jurisdictional discovery \" unless Plaintiffs jurisdictional \nclaims appear \"'clearly frivolous.\"' Toys \"R\" Us, Inc. v. Step Two, S.A., 318 F.3d 446, \n456 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, Inc. v. American \nBar Ass'n, 107 F.3d 1026, 1042 (3d Cir.1997)). If \"a plaintiff presents factual allegations \nthat suggest 'with reasonable particularity ' the possible existence of the requisite \n'contacts between [the party] and the forum state,' the plaintiffs right to conduct \njurisdictional discovery [must] be sustained. \" Id. (internal citation omitted). Jurisdictional \ndiscovery should not serve as \"a fishing expedition \" into the underlying merits, all while \n\"under the guise of jurisdictional discovery .\" LaSala v. Marfin Popular Bank Public Co., \nLtd., 410 F. App'x 474,478 (3d Cir.2011). \nUpon review of the filings, it is clear there is a real question regarding Senay's \nstatus as a corporate officer of Genocide Prevention . Accordingly , the Court finds that \nlimited jurisdictional discovery is appropriate. Defendants ' motion to dismiss Senay for \nlack of jurisdiction will be denied without prejudice to renew. \nC. Defamation \nDefendants seek dismissal on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state a \ndefamation claim. The tort of defamation is composed of two torts: libel, which is written \ndefamation, and slander, which is oral defamation . Spence v. Funk, 396 A.2d 967, 970 \n(Del. 1978). The elements of defamation are: (1) a defamatory communication ; (2) \n7 publication ; (3) the communication refers to the plaintiff; (4) a third party's understanding \nof the communication 's defamatory character ; and (5) injury. Clouser v. Doherty, 175 \nA3d 86, 2017 WL 3947404, at *7 (Del. 2017). A defamatory communication is one that \ntends to injure a person's reputation . See Orthopaedic Assocs. of S. Delaware , P.A. v. \nPfaff, 2018 WL 822020 , at *5 n.30 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 9, 2018) (citing Black's Law \nDictionary 480 (9th ed. 2009)). \nOnce a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a defendant may plead the truth \nof the alleged defamatory statements as a defense. (Id.). \"Under Delaware law there is \nno liability for defamation when a statement is determined to be true.\" Holmes v. The \nNews Journal Co., 2015 WL 1893150, at *3 (Del. Super. Apr. 20, 2015) (citing Riley v. \nMoyed, 529 A.2d 248, 253 (Del. 1987)). No defamation has occurred where a \nstatement is no more damaging to plaintiffs reputation in the mind of the average \nperson than a truthful statement would have been. Ramunno v. Cawley, 705 A.2d \n1029, 1035 (Del. 1998). \nDefendants argue that dismissal is appropriate because the letter at issue is not \ndefamatory since the statements contained in the letter are protected expressions of \nopinion. They argue that the Complaint's allegations misrepresent what the letter \nactually says as the Complaint alleges that the letter accuses Plaintiff of committing \ncrimes and the letter does not make such accusations. Plaintiff does not dispute \nmaking social media posts \"to criticize public officials and comment on social issues of \nthe day\" (D.I. 26 at ,I 27), and he urges that his comments do not rise to the level of \nsupport for crimes against humanity . He also argues that Defendants acted with malice \n8 since the letter asks Plaintiff's employer \"to reassess his fitness to work for [the VA] \ntreating and carrying patriots fighting for freedom and against terrorists .\" (D.1.1-1 at 4). \nThe First Amendment of the United States Constitution generally protects \nexpressions of opinion. See Kanaga v. Gannett Co., 687 A.2d 173, 177 (Del. 1996). \nThis does not mean that there is a \"wholesale defamation exemption for anything that \nmight be labeled opinion.\" Id. (quoting Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 18 \n(1990)). Rather, the touchstone is whether \"an ordinary reader of the statement\" would \nregard the statement as an expression of opinion. Riley v. Moyed, 529 A.2d at 251. \nAlthough pure statements of opinion are not actionable , an opinion \"may often \nimply an assertion of objective fact and, if the implied fact may be found to be false, the \ntrier of fact may find the plaintiff to have been libeled.\" Kanaga v. Gannett Co., 687 \nA.2d at 177. Therefore , the issue is whether \"the entire context of the published \nstatements , considered from the viewpoint of the average reader, may imply a false \nassertion of fact.\" Id. at 179. \nThe letter contains Defendants ' opinions that Plaintiff lacks moral principles and \ncharacter, but also contains many stated and implied defamatory facts as the basis of \nthat opinion. For example, an average reader may infer that Plaintiff supports genocide \nin Ethiopia. On this topic, Plaintiff claims the letter omitted important facts, including \nthat he has been speaking out against genocide on social media. (0.1. 1 at ffll 24, 25, \n35). The Delaware Supreme Court has stated, \"Even if the speaker states the facts \nupon which he bases his opinion, if those facts are either incorrect or incomplete , or if \nhis assessment of them is erroneous , the statement may still imply a false assertion of \nfact.\" Id. at 177 (quoting Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. at 18-19). The \n9 Delaware Supreme Court has also stated that \"the better rule does not distinguish \nbetween indirect and direct, or incomplete and complete libels, so long as the \ndefamation is susceptible to proof.\" Spence v. Funk, 396 A.2d at 972. After drawing all \ninferences in favor of Plaintiff, I find that dismissal is not appropriate on the ground that \nthe statements are non-actionable opinions because the ordinary reader could infer the \nexistence of facts which are capable of being proved true or false. \nAccordingly , Defendants ' motion to dismiss the defamation claim will be denied. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss as moot Defendant Biniam \nHirut Debabe's motion to dismiss; (2) deny Defendants Genocide Prevention in Ethiopa \nlnc.'s and Senait Senay's motion to dismiss; (3) allow the parties to conduct limited \njurisdictional discovery ; (4) dismiss as moot Defendant Biniam Hirut Debabe's motion \nfor leave to file an amended motion to dismiss; and (5) grant Plaintiffs motion to \nvoluntarily dismiss without prejudice Defendant Biniam Hirut Debabe pursuant to Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 41. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n10 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nTOLESSA GURMESSA , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nGENOCIDE PREVENTION IN \nETHIOPIA, INC., et al., \nDefendants. : Civil Action No. 21-869-RGA \n~ ORDER \nAt Wilmington this Z3 day of February, 2022 for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date; \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1.
