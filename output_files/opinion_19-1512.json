Pro se Petitioner.\n\nSean P. Lugg, Deputy Attorney General of the Delaware Department of Justice, Wilmington,\nDelaware. Attorney for Respondents.\n\nAugust 3 , 2022 |\n\nWilmington, Delaware\nANDREWS, UNI ED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPresently pending before the Court is Petitioner Charles E. Duffy\u2019s Application for a Writ\nof Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d). (D.I. 1) The State filed an Answer\nin opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.J. 11; D.I. 17) For the reasons discussed, the\nCourt will dismiss the Petition.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn September 9, 2017, a witness saw Petitioner following a woman throughout the\nDollar Store in Georgetown, Delaware and placing his cell phone under her skirt when her back\nwas turned. (D.I. 12-2 at 3) The witness informed the Dollar Tree management about\nPetitioner\u2019s actions, and management instructed him to leave the store. (See id.) The witness\nfollowed Petitioner into the parking lot, and noted that it looked like Petitioner was deleting\nphotos from his cell phone. Petitioner left the scene in a white Mercury Sable. (See id.)\n\nThe Georgetown Police Department was notified about Petitioner\u2019s conduct and, when a\npolice patrolman arrived at the Dollar Tree, the manager informed him that that Petitioner was a\nregular customer. (See id.) After learning Petitioner\u2019s address and that he operated a white\nMercury Sable, police units found Petitioner at his residence and took him into custody. The\npolice informed Petitioner about his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 486 (1966), at\nwhich point Petitioner told investigators that he used his cell phone to take pictures of the\nvictim\u2019s private parts. (See D.I. 12-2 at 3)\n\nOn January 12, 2018, Petitioner pled guilty in the Delaware Superior Court to one count\nof violation of privacy. (D.I. 12-3 at 15-16) The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner on April\n13, 2018 as an habitual offender to six years at Level V incarceration with credit for time served.\n\nSee Duffy v. State, 214 A.3d 443 (Table), 2019 WL 3491788, at *1 (Del. July 31, 2019).\n\nPetitioner filed a notice of appeal but withdrew the appeal before a briefing schedule was issued.\nSee id.\nPetitioner filed a motion for modification of sentence on June 4, 2018, which the Superior\nCourt denied on June 6, 2018. (D.I. 12-1 at Entry Nos. 37, 38) In July 2018, Petitioner filed a\npro se motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61\n(\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d), (D.I. 12-1 at Entry No. 39; DI. 12-5 at 1-18) The Superior Court denied\nthe Rule 61 motion in August 2018, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on\nFebruary 5, 2019. (D.I. 12-1 at Entry Nos. 39, 42, 52); see also State v. Duffy, 2018 WL\n4002244, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 15, 2018); Duffy v. State, 204 A.3d 113 (Table), 2019 WL\n459982, at *3 (Del. Feb. 5, 2019).\nPetitioner filed a motion for correction of sentence in March 2019. (D.I. 12-1 at Entry\nNo. 55) The Superior Court denied the motion, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that\ndecision on July 31, 2019. See Duffy, 2019 WL 3491788, at *3.\nIL GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\nA. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the\npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b);\nO'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275\n(1971). The AEDPA states, in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in\ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be\ngranted unless it appears that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts\nof the State; or\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or\n(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to\nprotect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).\n\nThe exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to\ngive \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one\ncomplete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O \u2018Sullivan, 526 U.S. at\n844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). A petitioner satisfies the\nexhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the habeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the\nstate\u2019s highest court, either on direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural\nmanner permitting the court to consider the claims on their merits. Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447,\n451 n.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). A federal legal claim is \u201cfairly\npresented\u201d to state courts when there is: \u201c(1) reliance on pertinent federal cases employing\nconstitutional analysis; (2) reliance on state cases employing constitutional analysis in like fact\nsituations; (3) assertion of the claim in terms so particular as to call to mind a specific right\nprotected by the Constitution; [or] (4) allegation of a pattern of facts that is well within the\nmainstream of constitutional litigation.\u201d McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 261 (3d Cir.\n1999).\n\nA petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused if state procedural rules\npreclude him from seeking further relief in state courts. See Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160\n(3d Cir. 2000); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 297-98 (1989). Although treated as technically\nexhausted, such claims are nonetheless procedurally defaulted. See Lines, 208 F.3d at 160;\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750-51 (1991). Similarly, ifa petitioner presents a habeas\n\n3\nclaim to the state\u2019s highest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the\nmerits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is\nexhausted but procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S.\n255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the\npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting\ntherefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the court does not review the\nclaims. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51; McCandless, 172 F.3d at 260. To demonstrate cause\nfor a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor external to the\ndefense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d Murray v.\nCarrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show\n\u201cthat [the errors at trial] worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire\ntrial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d fd. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, a federal court may excuse a procedural default if the petitioner\ndemonstrates that failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\nSee Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d\nCir. 2001). A petitioner demonstrates a miscarriage of justice by showing a \u201cconstitutional\nviolation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d Murray, 477\nU.S. at 496. Actual innocence means factual innocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v.\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). In order to establish actual innocence, the petitioner\nmust present new reliable evidence \u2014 not presented at trial \u2014 that demonstrates \u201cit is more likely\n\nthan not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nHouse v, Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 537-38 (2006); see Sweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 522-24 3d\nCir. 2002).\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\nIfa state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the federal\ncourt must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if the state court\u2019s\ndecision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was\nan unreasonable determination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn, 250\nF.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001). A claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) if the state court decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its\nsubstance, rather than on a procedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105,\n115 Gd Cir. 2009). The deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s\norder is unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cit may be\npresumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication\nor state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d Jd. at 99.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the state\ncourt's determinations of factual issues are correct. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This\npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact; it is only\n\nrebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); Miller-El\n\nvy. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7\n2254(e)(1) applies to \u201cfactual issues,\u201d whereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7\n2254(d)(2) applies to \u201cdecisions\u201d); Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000);.\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nPetitioner\u2019s timely filed \u00a7 2254 Petition and Memorandum in Support assert the\nfollowing five claims: (1) the police violated Petitioner\u2019s rights under Miranda by continuing to\nquestion him after he requested a lawyer (D.I. 1 at 7); (2) defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to: (a) file a suppression motion; (b) visit the crime scene; (c) interview the\nwitnesses and victim; (d) address the Miranda rights violation; and (e) address the illegal search\nand seizure of Petitioner\u2019s cell phone (D.I. 1 at 9; D.I. 2 at 33); (3) Petitioner was illegally and\nexcessively sentenced as a habitual offender (D.I. 1 at 10; DL. 2 at 4-9); (4) Petitioner\u2019s class G\nnon-violent felony was improperly enhanced to a class A violent felony due to his status as a\nregistered sex offender (D.I. 1 at 12); and (5) Petitioner\u2019s right to be protected against double\njeopardy was violated because the indictment was not sufficiently precise and included offenses\ndifferent from, and more serious than, those for which he was arrested (DI. 2 at 2-3; D.I. 16 at 7-\n10; D.L. 17 at 9-10).\n\nA. Claims One, Three, Four, and Five: Procedurally Barred\n\nThe record reveals that Petitioner did not exhaust state remedies for Claims One, Three,\nFour, and Five for two slightly different reasons. First, Petitioner did not raise Claim Five\u2019s\ninsufficient indictment/double jeopardy argument to the Delaware Supreme Court on direct\nappeal or post-conviction appeal. (See D.I. 12-4; D.I. 12-5) At this juncture, if Petitioner tried to\n\npresent Claim Five in a new Rule 61 motion, the motion would be barred as untimely under Rule\n61()(1) and barred as successive under Rule 61(i)(2). See Trice v. Pierce, 2016 WL 2771123, at\n*4 (D. Del. May 13, 2016); Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(2) (barring second or successive\nmotions unless certain pleading requirements are satisfied). Although Rule 61(i)(1) provides for\nan exception to the one-year time limitation if the untimely Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a\nretroactively applicable right that is newly recognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\u201d\nno such right is implicated in the instant argument. Similarly, the exceptions to Rule 61((1)\u2019s\ntime-bar and 61(i)(2)\u2019s successive bar contained in Rule 61(i)(5) and (d)(2) do not apply to\nPetitioner\u2019s case, because he does not allege a credible claim of actual innocence, lack of\njurisdiction, or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to the instant argument. Given these\ncircumstances, the Court must treat Claim Five as exhausted but procedurally defaulted, meaning\nthat the Court cannot review the merits of the Claim absent a showing of cause and prejudice or a\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\nSecond, although Petitioner presented Claims One, Three, and Four in his Rule 61\nmotion, the Superior Court denied the three Claims as procedurally barred under Delaware\nSuperior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(3). See Duffy, 2018 WL 4002244, at *1. The Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed that decision, explaining that the Superior Court properly found Claims\nOne, Three, and Four barred under Rule 61(i)((3) because Petitioner \u201cdid not raise these claims\non direct appeal of his conviction [and h]e did not attempt to establish cause for [...] the\n\nprocedural default or actual prejudice.\u201d! Duffy, 2019 WL 459982, at *2. By applying the\n\nThe Superior Court and the Delaware Supreme Court alternatively held that Petitioner waived\nthe arguments concerning errors that occurred prior to the entry of his guilty plea by entering a\nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary guilty plea. See Duffy, 2018 WL 4002244, at *1; Duffy, 2019\nWL 459982, at *2. Nevertheless, the state courts\u2019 alternative holding does not erase Petitioner\u2019s\nprocedural default. See Harris, 489 U.S. 264 n.10; Cabrera y. Barbo, 175 F.3d 307, 314 (3d Cir.\n1999) (explaining that the Appellate Division's reference to the merits of the ineffective\n\n7\n\nprocedural bar of Rule 61(i)(3), the Delaware Supreme Court articulated a \u201cplain statement\u201d\nunder Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 263-4 (1984) that its decision rested on state law grounds.\nThis Court has consistently held that Rule 61(4)(3) is an independent and adequate state\nprocedural rule effectuating a procedural default. See DeAngelo v. Johnson, 2014 WL 4079357,\nat *12 (D. Del. Aug. 15, 2014); Lawrie v. Snyder, 9 F. Supp. 2d 428, 451 (D. Del. 1998).\nTherefore, the Court cannot review the merits of Claims One, Three, and Four absent a showing\nof cause for the default, and prejudice resulting therefrom, or upon a showing that a miscarriage\nof justice will occur if the claim is not reviewed.\n\nPetitioner attempts to establish cause for his default of Claims One, Three, Four and Five\nby blaming defense counsel\u2019s \u201cmisleading advice\u201d to dismiss his appeal. (D.I. 1 at 8, 9, 11, 12)\nIneffective assistance provided by a trial and/or appellate attorney can constitute cause for a\nprocedural default if the particular ineffective assistance allegation was presented to the state\ncourts as an independent claim and it was determined that the attorney\u2019s error amounted to\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance. See Murray, 477 U.S. at 488-89. An ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim cannot constitute cause if the claim itself is procedurally defaulted.\nSee Edwards, 529 U.S. at 451-52.\n\nIn this case, even though Petitioner presented the Delaware courts with ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims based on defense counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the arguments in\nClaims One, Three, and Four, defense counsel\u2019s performance cannot excuse Petitioner\u2019s default\n\nof Claims One, Three, and Four because defense counsel\u2019s actions did not amount to\n\nassistance of counsel claim did not undermine the \u201cconclusion that the state courts rejected\nCabrera's claim on an independent and adequate state basis, as the comment at most was an\nalternative holding.\u201d).\n\n8\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance. See infra at Section III.B. In contrast, since Petitioner did\nnot present an ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the Delaware state courts that was\npremised on defense counsel\u2019s failure to raise the insufficient indictment/double jeopardy\nargument in Claim Five, this particular ineffective assistance allegation is procedurally defaulted.\nConsequently, defense counsel\u2019s alleged \u201cmisleading advice\u201d cannot establish cause for\nPetitioner\u2019s default of Claim Five.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s failure to establish cause eliminates the need to address prejudice.\nNevertheless, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the default of Claims One,\nFour, and Five because he waived any arguments based on those pre-plea claimed errors by\nknowingly and voluntarily entering a guilty plea. See infra at Section IIIB. Petitioner also\ncannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the default of Claim Three (alleging that his\nhabitual offender sentence was illegal and excessive) because of the substantial benefit he\nreceived by entering a guilty plea, namely, having the State recommend a seven-year sentence as\na habitual offender versus potentially being sentenced to life in prison if convicted at trial. (See\nDL. 12-3 at 4; DL. 12-5 at 14)\n\nFinally, Petitioner has not satisfied the miscarriage of justice exception to the procedural\ndefault doctrine, because he has not provided new reliable evidence of his actual innocence.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claims One, Three, Four and Five as procedurally barred from\nfederal habeas review.\n\nB. Claim Two: Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by\n\nfailing: (a) to file a suppression motion; (b) to visit the crime scene; (c) to interview the\n\n+\nwitnesses and victim; (d) to address the Miranda rights violation; and (e) to address the illegal\nsearch and seizure of his cell phone. (D.I. 1 at 9; D.L. 2 at 9-12, 17) Petitioner presented the\nallegations in Claim Two in his Rule 61 motion to the Superior Court and again on post-\nconviction appeal. The Superior Court denied the allegations as meritless, and the Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed that decision. Therefore, Claim Two will only warrant relief if the\nDelaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established federal law.\n\nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003). Under the first\nStrickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with reasonableness being judged under professional\nnorms prevailing at the time counsel rendered assistance. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688.\nUnder the second Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthere is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different.\u201d Jd. at 694. A reasonable probability is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine\nconfidence in the outcome.\u201d Jd In the context of a guilty plea, prejudice is established by\nshowing there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the defendant would not\nhave pleaded guilty and would have proceeded to trial. See Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59\n(1985). A court can choose to address the prejudice prong before the deficient performance\nprong, and reject an ineffective assistance of counsel claim solely on the ground that the\n\ndefendant was not prejudiced. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698.\n\n10\nFinally, in order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must\nmake concrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk summary dismissal.\nSee Wells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991); Dooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885,\n891-92 (3d Cir. 1987). Although not insurmountable, the Strickland standard is highly\ndemanding and leads to a strong presumption that the representation was professionally\nreasonable. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that the Delaware\nSupreme Court correctly identified the Strickland/Hill standard applicable to Petitioner\u2019s\nineffective assistance of counsel allegation. Consequently, the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision was not contrary to clearly established federal law. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 406 (\u201c[A]\nrun-of-the-mill state-court decision applying the correct legal rule from [Supreme Court] cases to\nthe facts of a prisoner\u2019s case [does] not fit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019\nclause\u201d).\n\nThe Court must also determine if the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied the\nStrickland/Hill standard to the facts of Petitioner's case. When performing the second prong of\nthe \u00a7 2254(d) inquiry, the Court must review the Superior Court's decision with respect to\n\nPetitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel Claim through a \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens.? See\n\n2s explained by the Richter Court,\n\nThe standards created by Strickland and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u201chighly\ndeferential,\u201d and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so. The\nStrickland standard is a general one, so the range of reasonable applications\nis substantial. Federal habeas courts must guard against the danger of\nequating unreasonableness under Strickland with unreasonableness under \u00a7\n2254(d).\n\nRichter, 562 U.S. at 105 (cleaned up).\nil\nRichter, 562 U.S. at 105. The relevant question when analyzing counsel's performance under the\n\n29 66s\n\n\u201cdoubly deferential lens\u201d \u201cis not whether counsel's actions were reasonable, [but rather], whether\n\nthere is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Stricklana\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d [d. In\nturn, when assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question is \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely\nthe result would have been different\u201d but for counsel's performance, and the \u201clikelihood of a\ndifferent result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\u201d Jd. Finally, when viewing a state\ncourt's determination that a Strickland claim lacks merit through the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal\nhabeas relief is precluded \u201cso long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the\nstate court's decision.\u201d Jd. at 101.\n\nThe Superior Court denied as meritless Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance allegations in\nClaim Two, opining:\n\n[Petitioner] made no showing to prove that his counsel acted below\nan objective standard of reasonableness when providing assistance\nat [his] plea hearing and sentencing. Nor can [Petitioner] show that,\nbut for counsel\u2019s errors, he would have insisted on proceeding to\ntrial. Moreover, the plea colloquy shows that [Petitioner]\nknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered into the plea.\n[Petitioner] was aware of the rights he was giving up and the\nconsequences of taking the plea. Defense counsel did not act\nimproperly while representing [Petitioner].\n\nDuffy, 2018 WL 4002244, at *2. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision, holding:\n\n[Petitioner\u2019s] ineffective assistance claims are not supported by the\nrecord. [Petitioner] waived his Miranda claim and his challenges to\nthe sufficiency of the evidence when he knowingly and voluntarily\npled guilty. Given the multiple charges against him and his criminal\nhistory, the guilty plea provided [Petitioner] with a clear benefit. He\nfaced multiple life sentences. Under the plea agreement, the State\nagreed to dismiss the other charges and cap its sentencing\nrecommendation to seven years of Level V incarceration.\n\nDuffy, 2019 WL 459982, at *2.\n\n12\n\nAfter reviewing the record, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts did not\nunreasonably apply Strickland and Hill when rejecting the allegations in Claim Two. The\ntranscript of Petitioner\u2019s January 12, 2018 plea colloquy contains his clear and explicit\nstatements that he discussed his case with defense counsel and that he was satisfied with his\ncounsel\u2019s representation. (D.I. 12-3 at 7) Petitioner also indicated that nobody forced him to\nenter a plea or promised anything that was not stated in the plea agreement. (D.I. 12-3 at 9) He\naffirmatively answered that he understood the plea constituted a waiver of all of his trial rights;\nthat he understood the charges and evidence against him; that he had no questions about the plea\nform and that he had filled it out honestly; that he understood the potential penalties; and that he\nunderstood the State was seeking to have him declared a habitual offender. (D.I. 12-3 at 7-13)\n\n\u201cSolemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity,\u201d which creates a\n\u201cformidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings.\u201d Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S.\n63, 74 (1977). In this proceeding, Petitioner has failed to provide compelling evidence as to why\nthe statements he made during the plea colloquy should not be presumptively accepted as true.\nConsequently, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts reasonably determined the\nfacts and reasonably applied Blackledge in holding that Petitioner was bound by the\nrepresentations he made during the plea colloquy, and that his guilty plea was voluntary.\n\nPetitioner also cannot satisfy the prejudice prong of the Strickland/Hill standard.\n\nPetitioner faced a potential sentence of life imprisonment if he were convicted at trial. In\n\n3Although the Delaware Supreme Court relied on state caselaw (Somerville v. State, 703 A.2d\n629, 632 (Del. 1997)) instead of Blackledge when concluding that Petitioner was \u201cbound by his\nrepresentations during the guilty plea colloquy and in the Truth-in-Sentencing Guilty Plea\nForm,\u201d the state caselaw applied the same standard articulated in Blackledge. Duffy, 2019 WL\n459982, at *2 n. 9.\n\n13\n\nexchange for his plea, \u201cthe State agreed to dismiss the other charges [against Petitioner] and cap\nits sentencing recommendation to seven years of Level V incarceration.\u201d Duffy, 2019 WL\n459982, at *2. Given the clear benefit Petitioner derived by pleading guilty, Petitioner\u2019s instant\nassertions fail to demonstrate that he would have proceeded to trial but for defense counsel\u2019s\nactions.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts reasonably\napplied Strickland and Hill in holding that the defense counsel\u2019s alleged errors did not constitute\nineffective assistance. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Two for failing to satisfy\n\u00a7 2254(d).4\n\nC. Motion for Leave to File an Amended Petition\n\nMore than a year after the State filed its Answer, Petitioner filed a Motion for Leave to\nFile an Amended Petition in order to add an argument that his \u201cconfession without independent\nevidence of the corpus delicti of the charge is insufficient to support a conviction.\u201d (D.I. 25 at 2)\nPetitioner contends that the State never introduced any \u201cincriminating tangible evidence\u201d and his\nconfession was involuntary because he was intoxicated at the time of the police interrogation.\n\n(DI. 25 at 4)\n\n4Even if Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel allegations in Claim Two satisfied the\nStrickland/Hill standard, Claim Two would not warrant relief. As explained in the text of the\nOpinion, the record demonstrates that Petitioner\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.\nA criminal defendant's valid guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional issues and claims \u201crelating\nto the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d\nTollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973); see Washington v. Sobina, 475 F.3d 162, 165\n(3d Cir. 2007). All of the ineffective assistance allegations in Claim Two involve non-\njurisdictional issues that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea and do not challenge the\nvoluntariness of the plea. Therefore, Petitioner waived his right to assert the ineffective\nassistance of counsel allegations in Claim Two.\n\n14\n\nHabeas petitions \u201cmay be amended or supplemented as provided in the rules of procedure\napplicable to civil actions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n15(a)(2), Petitioner may only amend his Petition with the State\u2019s consent or the Court's leave.\nAlthough courts \u201cshould freely give leave when justice so requires,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2),\ncourts may nevertheless deny a motion to amend when the amendment would be futile. See\nFoman vy. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); United States v. Duffus, 174 F.3d 333, 337 3d Cir.\n1999). Examples of futility in the habeas context include time-barred amendments that do not\nrelate back to the original petition, procedurally barred amendments, and amendments lacking\narguable merit. See Bernard v. United States, 2019 WL 3719405, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. 5, 2019)\n(noting that amending with time-barred claim that does not relate back would be futile); Hail v.\nPhelps, 641 F. Supp. 2d 334, 342 (D. Del. 2009).\n\nThe State opposes Petitioner\u2019s proposed amendment. (D.I. 26) Further, the Court\nconcludes that permitting the proposed amendment would be futile because the underlying\nargument lacks merit. For instance, as previously explained, Petitioner\u2019s voluntary guilty plea\nwaives all non-jurisdictional issues and claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights\nthat occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea. See supra at Section III.B. n.4. Since\nPetitioner\u2019s proposed amendment concerns a confession that occurred before Petitioner entered\nhis voluntary plea, the argument is waived. Thus, the Court will deny Petitioner\u2019s Motion for\nLeave to File an Amended Petition as futile.\n\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether\n\nto issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L-A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).\n\n15\n\nA certificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the\ndistrict court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2253(c)(2); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). Additionally, when a district court\ndenies a habeas claim or petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying\nconstitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the\npetitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the petition\nstates a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in\nits procedural ruling. See Slack, 529 U.S. at 484.\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief. Reasonable\njurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the Court will not issue a\ncertificate of appealability.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the Petition and pending Motion without\n\nholding an evidentiary hearing. An appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n16\n"}
