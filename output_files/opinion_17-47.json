No. 17-47- LPS-1  \n       :    \nOMAR MORALES COLON,    :             :   Defendant .    : \n       : \n \nMEMORANDUM O RDER \n At Wilmington this 7th day of March, 2022, having considered Defendant Omar Morales \nColon\u2019s Motion for Judgment of A cquittal on Count I or, in the A lternative, a N ew T rial on \nCount I (D.I. 449); Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on Count IV (D.I. 450); Supplem ental \nMotion for Judgment of Acquittal or, in the Alte rnative, a New Trial (D.I. 510); Second \nSupplemental Motion for a New Trial ( D.I. 515); and the government\u2019s response (D.I. 522),  \n IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, for the reasons given below, Colon\u2019s motions (D.I. \n449, 450, 510, 515) are DENIED. \nBACKGROUND \n On September 27, 2021, a jury found Colon guilty of conspiracy to distribute five \nkilograms or more of cocaine (Count I of the Indictment) and possession with intent to distribute marijuana  (Count IV  of the Indictment ).  (See D.I. 429)  During trial, a fter the close of the \ngovernment\u2019s case, Colon had moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 for a judgment of acquittal.  ( See D.I. 467 at 1043-44)  At that time, Colon did not articulate his \nreasons for seeking acquittal.  ( See i d.)  The Court denied Colon\u2019s motion.  ( Id.)  Following trial, \nColon filed the pending motions. 2 \n LEGAL STANDARDS  \nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 (a) provides that a defendant may move for  \n\u201cjudgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a \nconviction.\u201d  In considering a Rule 29 motion , the Court \u201cmust review the record in the light \nmost favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the available evidence.\u201d  United States v. Brodie , 403 F.3d 123, 133 (3d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted) .  The government \nmay defeat a sufficiency of the evidence challenge on circumstantial evidence alone.  See U nited \nStates v. Iglesias , 535 F.3d 150, 156 (3d Cir. 2008).  In assessing such a challenge, the Court \nmust \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, and must presume that the jury has properly carried out its functions of evaluating credibility of witnesses, finding the facts, and drawing justifiable inferences.\u201d  United  States v. Lacy , 446 F.3d 448, 451 (3d Cir. 2006).  \nThe C ourt must not \u201cusurp the role of the jury by weighing credibility and assigning weight to \nthe evidence, or by substituting its  judgment for that of the jury.\u201d  Brodie , 403 F.3d at 133.  \nThus, the defendant bears a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d when challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury verdict.  United States v. Coyle , 63 F.3d 1239, 1243 (3d Cir. 1995).  \nA \u201cfinding of insufficiency should be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019 s failure is clear.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Smith, 294 F.3d 473, 477 (3d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted) . \n Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 (a) provides that a \u201ccourt may vacate any  \njudgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so re quires.\u201d  Pursuant to Rule 33(a), a \ndistrict court may  order a new trial on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict is contrary to the weight \nof the evidence, but only if it \u201cbelieves that there is a serious danger that a miscarriage of justice has occurred \u2013 that is, that an innocent person has been convicted.\u201d  United States v. Brennan, 3 \n 326 F.3d 176, 189 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although the decision to \ngrant a new trial is discretionary, see United States v. Noel , 905 F.3d 258, 270 (3d Cir. 2018), \n\u201c[m] otions for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence are not favored,\u201d Gov\u2019t of Virgin \nIslands v. Derricks , 810 F.2d 50, 55 (3d Cir. 1987).  Such motions should be granted \u201csparingly \nand only in exceptional cases.\u201d   Derricks , 810 F.2d at 55.  \nDISCUSSION  \n Colon seeks to invalidate the jury\u2019s verdict as to Counts I and IV, arguing primarily that the government\u2019s evidence as to those Counts is insufficient, inconsistent, or both.  Colon also identifies alleged deficiencies in the government\u2019s discovery materials that, in his view, warrant a new trial.  Additionally , Colon asserts claims of ineffective assistance of counsel  and alleges he \nwas deprived of a fair trial , due to the failings of counsel and for other reasons as well .  \n As the Court will explain, Colon has not met his \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d under Rule 29 to demonstrate that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict as to either Count on which he was convicted.  Coyle, 63 F.3d at 1243; see also Iglesias , 535 F.3d at \n155 (describing burden as \u201cextremely high\u201d).  Nor has Colon shown that this is an  \u201cexceptional \ncase\u201d in which the interests of justice require granting a new trial under Rule 33.  Derricks , 810 \nF.2d at 55.  Instead, the jury\u2019s convictions a re well -supported by substantial evidence which was \ntimely disclosed by the government and which Colon had a full and fair opportunity to challenge at trial.   First, Colon argues the evidence supporting his conviction as to Count I (conspir acy to \ndistribute cocaine) is  both insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict and inconsistent.  ( See, e.g., \nD.I. 510 at 3-10)  With respect to the sufficiency of evidence, the jury heard expert chemist \ntestimony, co-conspirator testimony, investigative testimony, and testimony regarding video and 4 \n cell phone records.  ( See D.I. 522 at 11)1  As the government notes, the fact that Colon was \nacquitted on Count II (attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine) \u2013 an offense \ninvolving different elements and considerations of proof \u2013 does not undermine the abundant evidence tying him directly to the conspiracy.  ( See id.  at 2-6, 10-11 (\u201c[T]he fact that the jury \nconvicted Colon of some counts and not others shows that the jury was able to understand that the government had to prove different elements for each count and demonstrates that deliberations were thoughtful.\u201d))  Colon\u2019s arguments regarding potential cocaine subdistributors Devin Hackett and William Brisco do nothing to undermine the sufficiency of the evidence.  Colon asserts that the government presented no evidence Hackett and Brisco  were \u201cknown cocaine dealers.\u201d  (D.I. 510 \nat 3)  Moreover, there was no evidence the se two alleged subdistributors were observed with \ncocaine or  that they admitted to distributing cocaine with Colon.  ( See id.  at 3-4)  As the \ngovernment explains, however, the guilty verdict did not depend on the jury believing Hackett \n \n1 Among much other evidence, the government rightly highlights in its response to the motions \n\u201cthe testimony of Colon\u2019s co-conspirator,\u201d Roque Valdez, summarizing: \n \nAs the driver who drove seventy- seven kilograms of cocaine from \nCalifornia to Delaware on four occasions, Valdez testified at trial as to the nature, duration, and scope of the six- month conspiracy.  He \nidentified Colon as his co -conspirator to whom he del ivered cocaine \nin Delaware on three prior occasions, and to whom he intended to deliver cocaine on the day of the arrests.  Prior to and during Valdez\u2019s testimony, the government introduced business records from Valdez\u2019s four hotel stays at the Red Roof Pl us hotel (exactly \ncorresponding to the dates of his visits to Delaware to deliver cocaine to Colon), car rental records for trucks rented by Colon during those trips for Valdez and [co -conspirator Mohamed] Aviles \nCamberos to drive while in Delaware, as well as pictures taken from Valdez\u2019s own cell phone during his trips to Delaware. \n (D.I. 522 at 2) (internal footnotes and other citations to evidence omitted)\n 5 \n and Brisco were involved in the conspiracy; rather, in revealing Colon\u2019s associations with \nHackett and Brisco, the government aimed primarily to tie Colon\u2019s burner phones back to him.   \n(See D.I. 5 22 at 11)  The jury did not have to believe that Hackett and Brisco distributed cocaine \nfor Colon in order to find, based on the totality of the evidence, that Colon conspired to distribute cocaine.    \n As to Colon\u2019s argument that the wiretap evidence was insufficient to establish , through \ncommunications with Hackett and Brisco, which phones belonged to Colon, the Court again disagrees.  In reaching its verdict, the jury heard a recording of Colon\u2019s voice, which was corroborated by testimony from Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Anthony Salvemini; text messages to Hackett and Brisco , planning meetings with Colon that were directly \nobserved by surveillance officers ; and additional text messages between Colon and Hackett.   \n(See id.  at 12)  The fact that testifying office rs did not prepare notes or a report of the ir \nsurveillance \u2013 a fact which defense counsel raised on cross- examination ( see D.I. 464 at 652) \u2013 \ndoes little to weaken this evidence, particularly considering reports of the meetings capturing the officers \u2019 observations were produced to the defense (D.I. 522 at 12 n.12).  Similarly, Colon\u2019s \npost- trial challenge to the summary charts depicting captur ed phone communications ( see GX \n415-16) are both untimely (as they could have been raised pre- trial or during trial ) and  identify \n(at most) harmless error , considering the abundant additional eviden ce linking Colon to the \nalleged conspiracy ( see D.I. 522 at 12 n.13).  \n Next, Colon challenges the expert testimony of Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) Resident Agent in Charge (\u201cRAC\u201d) Philip  Bernal, who testified as to  (among other \nthings) the meaning of the code word \u201cfish scale\u201d and the use o f a hydraulic press.  ( See D.I. 510 \nat 5)  Colon, acting pro se at this point in the trial, cross -examined RAC Bernal as to both topics 6 \n (see D.I. 467 at 994-95, 1011-13) ; before trial, the Court had heard extensive argument and made \na detailed ruling as to the scope of RAC Bernal \u2019s testimony, including with respect to code \nwords.  ( See Sept. 9, 2021 Tr. at 24-58; see also D.I. 413 )  Colon does not appear to argue that  \nRAC Bernal\u2019s testimony deviated from what the Court had ruled he would be permitted to \ntestify.   Moreover, Colon\u2019s effort s to undermine RAC Bernal\u2019s  testimony by directing the Court \nto a newly introduced online resource ( see D.I. 510 at 5 n.9) and  to present  arguments he could \nhave made during trial are unavailing.  The time to challenge a witness with such evidence was during trial.    Finally, Colon points to various alleged inconsistencies in the government\u2019s evidence linking him to certain phones used during the spring of 2017 and contends this evidence was prejudicial .  (See id. at 6-10)  For example, Colon cites differences between the subpoenaed T-\nMobile records and the Cellebrite reports in terms of the number of contacts made between Colon and his alleged supplier, Aviles Camberos.  ( Id. at 7-8)  As the government notes, Colon \nwas free to explore this inconsistency on cross- examination  but opted not to do so.  ( See D.I. 522 \nat 13)  Colon\u2019s  suggestion that the government may have modified the T-Mobile files (which  he \ncontends are editable) to differ from the Cellebrite files (which purportedly cannot be edited) is unsupported.  ( See D.I. 51 0 at 8 -9) \n The Court is not persuaded by Colon\u2019s lengthy discussion of file storage and movement in cell  phones and applications like WhatsApp or Telegram.  ( See id.  at 9)  As the government \nnotes, neither Newark Police Department Sergeant  James  Skinner nor DEA Investigative \nResearch Specialist (\u201cIRS\u201d) Patrick Campbell represented that the records upon which they relied exhaustively captured every instance of  contact between Colon and others during the time \nperiod of the recordings.  (See D.I. 522 at 14 & n.16)  For the same reason, the Court is not 7 \n persuaded by Colon\u2019s argument that, since the records do not reflect a call between Colon and \nAviles  Camberos during May 2017, the jury should not have heard testimony from Valdez that \nhe heard a conversation between the two  in May 2017.  ( See D.I. 510 at 7)  Finally, the one- digit \ndifference between TT9\u2019s IMEI number on the Cellebrite report and the T-Mobile record do es \nnot support invalidating the jury\u2019s verdict.2  \n Despite the existence of some minor inconsistencies, this evidence is  not unfairly \nprejudicial, particularly considering the strong evidence that the nine phone lines discussed during trial belonged to Colon.  Among that evidence is testimony from IRS Campbell and others involved in the wire investigation; the recovery from Colon\u2019s person of a phone that IRS Campbell predicted Colon would be using; and the fact that the associated phone number communicated with Aviles Camberos in April 2017 to coordinate a drug delivery.  ( See GX \n117a, 120a)     Second, Colon argues the evidence supporting his conviction as to Count IV ( possessi on \nof marijuana with intent to distribute ) is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.  ( See D.I. 450 \nat 2-5)  The Court disagrees.  Nearly 2,000 grams of harvested marijuana w ere found at Colon\u2019s \nhome at 4010 Kirkwood St. Georges Road ( see GX 27 -30, 1156), along with a book about \ncultivating marijuana entitled \u201cCannabis Indica\u201d ( see GX 1162) and an operation consistent with \na former marijuana grow (see D.I. 522 at 6-7).  The recovered, suspected marijuana was tested \nby a DEA lab and deemed to be marijuana.  ( See id. at 7 -8)  Much larger quantities of marijuana \nwere also found in a storage unit in the name of Colon\u2019s mother- in-law, Nilsa Martinez.  ( See id. )  \n \n2 The Court disagrees with Colon that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the one-\ndigit difference in the phone\u2019s IMEI numbers is that the ph one on which the Cellebrite extraction \nwas performed was not the same phone seized from Colon during his May 6, 2017 arrest.  ( See \nD.I. 515 at 5) 8 \n The government presented evidence that Colon paid rent for that storage unit and had accessed it \non the morning of his arrest.  ( See id.  at 7)  Additional bags of marijuana were found in a storage \nunit rented by Colon\u2019s niece, Aixa Figueroa.  ( See id. )  Wh en Colon was arrested, agents  found \non his person keys to that storage unit.  ( See id. )  Viewing all the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the verdict \u2013 as the Court must, in connection with Colon\u2019s Rule 29 motion \u2013 t he \njury\u2019s guilty verdict on Count IV was well -supported.  Colon has not met his \u201cvery heavy \nburden\u201d to demonstrate that a cquittal under Rule 29 is warranted.  Coyle, 63 F.3d at 1243. \n Turning to Colon\u2019s Rule 33 motion, Colon argues that deficiencies in the government\u2019s discovery materials caused prejudice requiring a new trial.   (See D.I. 510 at 12-15)  For instance, \nhe alleges the government \u2019s failure to produce statements made by Brisco and Hackett after their \narrest and cell phone seizure was a Brady  violation.  ( See id. at 12 -13)  He  also complains that \nthe Cellebrite reports and T -Mobile records  were not produced in their entirety.  ( See id. at 13 -\n15)  The government counters that such reports and records were produced to Colon long ago.  (See D.I. 522 at 15-16; see also id. at 15 (\u201cA consistent theme throughout the years of \nprosecution of this case has been defendant claiming the government has not produced items that were, in reality, produced time and again.\u201d))  The government even re-formatted  certain  T-\nMobile records so Colon could view them at the Federal Detention Center, and produced the lengthy Cellebrite reports to defense counsel in 2019, le aving ample time for review  in advance \nof the September 2021 trial.  ( See id.  at 16 ) \n The Court agrees with the government that Colon\u2019s Brady  challenges fall flat  for multiple \nreasons.  ( See id.  at 15-16)  M ost importantly, as the government notes, the arrest reports of \nBrisco and Hackett  (who declined to be interviewed), the Cellebrite reports, and the T -Mobile \nrecords  are not exculpatory in nature.  ( See id. at 16 )   9 \n  Nor has the government failed to disclose Jencks  or Giglio  material.  Colon received all \nof the proffer statements and interviews given by Valdez in advance of trial, on September 2, \n2021.  ( See id. )  Although the government did not provide Valdez\u2019s criminal history \u2013 which \nincludes one DUI conviction and two arrests that did not result in convictions \u2013 this was harmless error , as Valdez testified about his DUI conviction at trial, and the government would \nhave objected (successfully) to a line of questioning regarding arrests that did not lead to convictions.  ( See id. )   \n Colon argues further that  the government failed to produce additional impeachment \nevidence relating to Valdez, including copies of Valdez\u2019s \u201cmultiple drivers\u2019 licenses,\u201d purportedly \u201cdamaging pictures and comments\u201d from Valdez\u2019s Facebook account, and a history of traffic violations  and eviction judgments in Arizona.  ( See D.I. 515 at 6; D.I. 510 at 10)  The \ngovernment counters that it \u201cwas not in possession of this evidence, and learned of these items for the first time in the defendant\u2019s filing.\u201d  (D.I. 522 at 16-17)  Additionally , the information \nwas publicly available, and thus accessible to Colon.  ( See id.  at 17 )  Moreover,  Vald ez\u2019s \nresidency is not relevant to his role in the government\u2019s case.  ( See id. )  To the extent Valdez\u2019s  \ntestimony is inconsistent with publicly available records (or other evidence), Colon was free to raise these (minor) inconsistencies at trial, when the jury was evaluating  Valdez\u2019s overall  \ncredibility , but Colon did not do so. \n In sum, Colon has failed to identify deficiencies in the government\u2019s discovery  \nmaterials that would warrant granting a new trial under Rule 33. \n Finally,  Colon raises claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, focusing on the \nrepresentation provided by Ms. Chavar, who was appointed by the Court in May 2021 and repre sented Colon through the first half of trial, before the Court ruled that he had waived his 10 \n right to counsel by his conduct.  ( See D.I. 449 at 3-7; D.I. 510 at 6)  In the Court\u2019s view, these \nclaims are premature and do not provide a basis for the relief sought.3 \n I neffective assistance of counsel claims are generally not ripe on a motion for a new trial \nor on direct review, but rather are to be presented, if at all, on collateral review.   See United \nStates v. Kennedy , 354 F. App\u2019x 632, 637 (3d Cir. 2009) (\u201c[R]arely,  if ever, should an \nineffectiveness of counsel claim be decided in a motion for a new trial or on direct \nappeal.\u201d);  United States v. Thornton, 327 F.3d 268, 271 (3d Cir. 2003) (\u201cIt has long been the \npractice of this court to defer the issue of ineffectiveness of trial counsel to a collateral attack.\u201d).  That latter mechanism is better suited \u201c \u2018to accommodate the interests in finality and fairness with \nrespect to ineffective assistance of counsel claims. \u2019\u201d  United States v. DeRewal , 10 F.3d 100, 105 \n(3d Cir.  1993) (quoting United States v. Ugalde , 861 F.2d 802, 809 (5th Cir. 1988)).  To the \nextent the Court has discretion to handle such claims at this stage, Colon has not presented a persuasive reason for the Court to do so.  The Court has carefully considered Colon\u2019s additional arguments and finds them unpersuasive.  Colon\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct ( see D.I. 510 at 15-16) are \nunsupported and, as the Court has already explained, the finding that Colon waived his right to counsel by conduct was based on con flicts of Colon\u2019s own making ( see, e.g. , D.I. 516 at 5-7).  \nColon provides no support for his suggestion that his waiver by conduct somehow entitle d him to \na continuance of trial.  ( See D.I. 510 at 15)  Nor has he set forth a persuasive argument that the \ndelay during trial related to Ms. Chavar\u2019s administrative suspension somehow constitute d a \ndenial of a fair trial.  ( See D.I. 515 at 6-10)   \n \n3 Nothing stated in the instant order should be understood to detract from or alter the findings the \nCourt made (including with respect to issues of effectiveness of counsel) in connection with \nfinding Colon had waived his right to counsel by conduct.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 466 at 8 35) 11 \n CONCLUSION \n For all of the foregoing reasons, Colon\u2019s Rule 29 and 33 motions are DENIED .   \n \n  \n  \n__________________ _____________ \n HONORABLE LEONARD P.
