{"case_name": "Allergan USA, Inc. et al v. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited et al", "case_number": "19-cv-02317-RGA", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "01-03-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nALLERGAN USA, INC., et al., \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nSUN PHARMACEUTICAL \nINDUSTRIES LIMITED , et al., \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 19-2317-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nFact discovery closed December 10, 2021. (D.I. 202 (order entered Nov. 4, 2021); see \nD.I. 228 at 1)). \nIn depositions at the tail end of discovery , Plaintiffs asked questions (as set forth at D.I. \n227, Exs. H & I) about the \"spiking study.\" (D.I. 227 at Ex. F, 66750). The witnesses were not \nhelpful. Plaintiffs rely upon three Rule 30(b)(6) topics as the basis for saying that they asked for \na witness knowledgeable about the spiking study. But I agree with Zydus that unless the \ninterrogatories are interpreted even more broadly than their already facially broad scope, \nPlaintiffs did not ask for a witness who could explain the spiking study. I do not have to assume \nthat Zydus 's assertion (D.I. 228 at 3) that Plaintiffs did not even discuss this issue in the meet\u00ad\nand-confer is true (although Plaintiffs cite nothing in their letter suggesting that it was raised \nbefore December 27th), although ifl were to, it would be even clearer that Plaintiffs' request is \ntoo late and not based on anything that they have preserved by their Rule 30(b)(6) notice. \nThe larger issue concerns developmental batch testing that Zydus asserts involves \ndifferent ingredients and/or methods than the way Zydus asserts the ANDA product has been and \nwill be made. Zydus relies upon a decision that, after trial, found that the development batches \nPage l of2 were not representative . (D.I. 228 at Ex. D). It seems to me the development batches might or \nmight not be relevant depending on various factors, and I am not prepared to say now that they \nare irrelevant based simply on Zydus's assertion in discovery that the development batches are \nnot representative of the final ANDA product. But it appears that the laboratory notebooks \ndescribing the development batches have been produced. (D.I. 228 at Ex. Kat 93: 14-20; 103: 18-\n23). Thus, I think what would be proportional to the needs of the case would be for Zydus to \nanswer Interrogatories No. 8 and 9 by stating (1) which batch records relate to which batches, \nand (2) with some granularity , what it is that makes the development batches not representative \nof the final product. I do not think further Rule 30(b)(6) testimony is proportional to the needs of \nthe case. \nZydus SHALL AMEND its answers to Interrogatories 8 and 9 within ten days. All other \nrelief is DENIED . IT IS SO ORDERED this 3rd day of January 2022. \nPage 2 of2 "}
