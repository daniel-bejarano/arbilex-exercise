Pro Se Plaintiff. \nApril 26, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff King James Albert Flowers appears pro se and has been granted leave \nto proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 4) He commenced this action on January 27, 2022. \n(D.I. 2). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B). \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. \n2008). Plaintiff was born on August 23, 1979, and this is the day his cause of action \naccrued. (D.I. 2 at 4, 5). According to Plaintiff, he has the status and sovereignty by \nbirthright as the King of Delaware and the King of Israel. (Id. at 4). He alleges his \nlegacy has been violated by the unknowing \"non-recognition\" of Defendants. (Id.). \nPlaintiff alleges a calculation proves that he is the chosen King of Israel and Delaware \nand that Defendants unknowingly and unjustly failed to recognized him as a monarch. \n(Id. at 5). Plaintiff asks that he receive the rights of a monarch and a sovereign. (Id. at \n5, 6). He seeks compensatory damages and injunctive relief. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take \nthem in the light most favorable to a prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 \n1 F.3d 224,229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \"however \ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings \ndrafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 \nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 \n(3d Cir. 2002). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends 'on an \"indisputably \nmeritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or delusional\" factual \nscenario.\"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Hom, 318 F.3d 523, \n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions. Tourscherv. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), the Court \nmust grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be \ninequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in \nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court \nconcludes that those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell \nAt/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations\" \nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \"labels and \n2 conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" Davis v. \nAbington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF \nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient \nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 \nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal \ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine \nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. \nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations \nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \"show\" that \nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nIll. DISCUSSION \nThis Court finds that the Complaint contains fantastical and/or delusional claims \nthat are insufficient to withstand the \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(8)(I) evaluation for frivolity dismissal. \nSee Denton v. Hernandez, 504 U.S. 25, 32-33 (1992) (complaint may be dismissed as \n3 lacking a basis in fact if premised upon allegations that are fanciful, fantastic, and \n- . . - - - -\ndelusional); Golden v. Coleman, 429 F. App'x 73 (3d Cir. 2011). In addition, according \nto Plaintiff, the claim accrued on August 28, 1979, yet Plaintiff did not file this action until \nJanuary 27, 2022, some 42 years later. While there are some long limitation periods in \nthe State of Delaware, this Court is unaware of any applicable statute of limitation \n(based upon the allegations) that allows for the filing of a civil claim more than forty \nyears after the claim accrues.1 See e.g., Farnsworth v. Biden, 2021 WL 2142881, at *2 \n(D. Del. May 26, 2021). The claims are clearly time-barred .. \nAfter thoroughly reviewing the Complaint and applicable law, this Court draws on \nits judicial experience and common sense and finds that the claims are frivolous. The \nComplaint will be dismissed the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as moot all pending motions \n(D.I. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Amendment is futile. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n1 Under Delaware common law, the statute of limitations for contracts under seal is \ntwenty years. See Whittington v. Dragon Grp., L.L.C., 991 A.2d 1, 10 n.21 (Del. 2009). \nA cause of action based the sexual abuse of a minor by an adult may be filed at any \ntime following the commission of the act. See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8145. \n4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nKING JAMES ALBERT FLOWERS , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nTHE STATE OF DELAWARE , et al., \nDefendants. : Civil Action No. 22-113-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington , this 26th day of April 2022, for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date; \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1. All pending motions are DENIED as moot. (0.1. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15) \n2. The Complaint is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) . \nAmendment is futile. \n3.
