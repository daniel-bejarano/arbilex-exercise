(D.I. 1)  On May 24, 2022, the parties jointly \nconsented to the Court\u2019s ability to conduct all proceedings in this case, including the entry of a 2 \n final judgment.  (D.I. 3)  Plaintiff George L. Miller , Chapter 7 Trustee of United Tax Group LLC \n(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) filed no objections to the Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  \n(December 1, 2021 Docket Entry)   \nPursuant to Fed. R. Bank. P. 9033(d) and other governing law, the Court has reviewed  the \nProposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\u2014a decision that addresses  Defendants SWZ \nFinancial II, LLC \u2019s, Tax Help MD Inc. \u2019s, Allerand, LLC \u2019s and Richard J. Sabella \u2019s (collectively, \n\u201cDefendants\u201d) motions for summary judgment\u2014de novo.  See Am. Flint Glass Workers Union v. Anchor Resolution Corp., 197 F.3d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1999).  After h aving carefully conducted that \nreview , and having discerned no error of fact or law in the Proposed Findings of Fact and \nConclusions of Law, the Court ORDERS that they are ADOPTED.  Defendants \u2019 motions for \nsummary judgment are hereby  GRANTED.\n1 \nThe Clerk of the Court is directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendants and against \nPlaintiff.  \n \nDated:   March 1 , 2023    ____________________________________ \nChristopher J. Burke \nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \n \n \n1  The Court had asked the parties to jointly prepare a form of order that it could \nenter after review of the Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  Although Plaintiff \nhad filed no objections to the Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, its proposed \nform of order would have (without further explanation) had the Court :  (1) reject those findings \nand conclusions; and (2) deny Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 7; D.I. 7 -1 at \n17-18)  Yet  Plaintiff has provided the Court with no argument or legal basis  to justify such an \noutcome here.  With the Court\u2019s review of the Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law having also provided it with no indication as to why that decision should be overturned, the Court has adopted the decision as set out above. \n \n"}
