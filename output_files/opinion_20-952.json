No. 20- 952-CFC  \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION AND ORDER \n \n Pending before the Court is an unopposed motion for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff s \nFKS Akkad Capital GP, LLC (\u201cFKS Akkad Capital  GP\u201d) and Stephen Shaya.  (D.I. 21.)  Ha ving \nreviewed the papers filed in support of the motion, I recommend that the Court deny the motion \nwithout prejudice to Plaintiffs\u2019 ability  to file another  motion and supporting brief that address \nand/or correct the deficiencies identified below . \nDefendants\u2019 counsel withdrew from this matter on July 29, 2021, a nd Plaintiff s filed their \nmotion for summary judgment on October 18, 2021.  Defendants did not file an answering brief.  \nOn January 19, 2022, the Court ordered that \u201cDefendants shall be given a final opportunity to \nrespond to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\u201d by Februar y 2, 2022.  Defendants again failed to respond.  On April \n8, 2022, t he Court referred the matter to me for a report and recommendation. \nIn the Third Circuit, a  district court cannot grant an unopposed motion for summary \njudgment without considering whether  summary judgment is appropriate . Anchorage Assocs. v. \nV.I. Bd. of Tax Review , 922 F.2d 168, 175 (3d Cir. 1990) ; see also  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(3) (court Case 1:20-cv-00952-CFC   Document 29   Filed 04/21/22   Page 1 of 4 PageID #: 6052 \n \u201cmay . . . grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials \u2014including the facts \nconsidere d undisputed\u2014 show that the movant is entitled to it.\u201d).   \nOn the record before me, I cannot recommend that the Court grant the requested relief .  \nHaving carefully reviewed the motion and supporting papers, I have  concerns  about a number of \nissues, including but not limited to the following:  \na. Plaintiffs \u2019 record support for many of their assertions of fact comes from \nDefendants\u2019 failure to respond to Plaintif fs\u2019 August 6, 2021 First Set of Requests for \nAdmission .  Since the record does not reflect that the parties have ever conferred as \nrequired by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f), it is unclear whether  Plaintiffs\u2019 \ndiscovery requests  were appropriate ly served.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26( d)(1) (\u201cA party may \nnot seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule \n26(f), except in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B), or when authorized by these rules , by stipulation, or by court order. \u201d).  I am also skeptical  of \nthe propriety of granting summary judgment against an unrepresented corporate entity where the record  support for the movant\u2019s  assertions of fact consists of  defaulted requests \nfor admission ( and Plaintiff s\u2019 briefing  cites no authority suggesting that it is proper ). \nb. The evidence of record does not appear to demonstrate Plaintiff Shaya\u2019s  \nentitlement to a judgment as a matter of law  against Defendant s for conversion or unjust \nenrichment.   As the  record is devoid of evidence about the circumstances surrounding \nShaya\u2019s  transfer of $100,000 to Defendants , the Court is unable to conclude  as a matter of \nlaw that Defendants wrongfully exercised dominion over it  (as required to show \nconversion)  or retained it in the absence of a justification  (as required to show unjust \nenrichment) .  Moreover,  Plaintiffs \u2019 brief  cites no evidence in  support of the assertion that Case 1:20-cv-00952-CFC   Document 29   Filed 04/21/22   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 6063 \n \u201cDr. Shaya made the $100,000 Payment based on the Fei -Kai Representations and with the \nunderstanding that the payment was returnable on demand.\u201d  (D.I. 21 at 16.)   \nc. As for the  breach of contract claim, Plaintiff s contend that  Defendant \nJohnFK Medical Co., Inc. ( \u201cFKS Medical Group \u201d) was \u201crequired under the LP agreement\u201d \nto pay management fees to Plaintiff FKS Akkad Capital  GP.  (See D.I. 21 at 10 \u00b6 36 (citing \nPlaintiffs\u2019 unanswered Requests for Admission).)  To the extent that Plaintiff s rely solely \non an unanswered request for admis sion to support that assertion, I have  concerns for the \nreasons stated above.  Plaintiffs \u2019 summary judgment  briefing does not otherwise explain \nthe basis  for their theory that Defendant FKS Medical Group  is required (under the \npartnership agreement, the De laware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, or \notherwise) to pay management fees directly to FKS Akkad Capital GP as a remedy for FKS \nGroup\u2019s failure to make a capital contribution to the partnership.  Nor does the briefing \nadequately explain why FKS A kkad Capital  GP is entitled to  two years  of expected \nmanagement fees.  \nd. Plaintiff  FKS Akkad Capital GP appear s to seek both expectation damages \n($15 million) and reliance damages  ($51,228.54)  on its breach of contract claim, but \nPlaintiffs\u2019 briefing provides  no legal authority for the proposition that it may recover both \ntypes of  damages.1 \nI believe that the most efficient and appropriate course of action is to deny Plaintiff s\u2019 motion \nwithout prejudice to Plaintiff s\u2019 ability to  file a new mo tion for summary judgment that address es \n \n1 While it might  not be necessary to rule on the summary judgment motion, the Court is  \nalso curious about the circumstances that led these  parties to negotiate and ink a $1 billion deal \nwithin the span of a  couple months , including whether it is tru e (as Defendants alleged in their \nAnswer ) that Plaintiffs and their counsel drafted the deal paperwork and that Defendants were \nunrepresented by counsel when they  signed agreements to contribute  $1 billion.  ( See D.I. 14.)    Case 1:20-cv-00952-CFC   Document 29   Filed 04/21/22   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 6074 \n the concerns and deficiencies set forth above  (and/or file a motion for default judgment ).  \nAccordingly, I recommend that Plaintiff s\u2019 motion for summary judgment be DENIED without \nprejudice to refile . \nIn addition, as Defendant FKS Medical Group is a corporation and may only appear in \ncourt by representation of a licensed attorney, the Court ORDERS FKS Medical Group to obtain \ncounsel, who must enter an appearance in this matter on or before May 17, 2022. \n Plaintiffs shall serve this Report and Recommendation and Order on Defendants within \nseven days, in accordance with the Court\u2019s July 29, 2021 Order (D.I. 20).     \n \nDated:  April 21, 2022     ___________________________________ \n       The Honorable Jennifer L. Hall \n       United States Magistrate Judge  \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00952-CFC   Document 29   Filed 04/21/22   Page 4 of 4 PageID #: 608"}
