Lowe, Jr. (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d ), alleging \nemployment- related discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, \net seq. , the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Plaintiff , who proceeds pro se , opposes the motion.  \n(D.I. 16).  For the reasons stated below, Defendant\u2019s motion will be granted. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff filed his Complaint on January 3, 2021, alleging violation of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, et seq. , for employment discrimination \non the basis of disability.  (D.I. 1).  Plaintiff did not allege any specific factual allegations nor did \nhe attach any exhibits other than a right to sue letter from the Delaware Department of Labor.   \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nrequires the Court to ac cept as true all material allegations of the complaint.  See Spruill v. Gillis , \n372 F.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir. 2004).  \u201cThe issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d  In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, the Court may grant such a motion to dismiss only if, after \u201caccepting all well- pleaded allegations \nin the complaint as true, and view ing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not \nentitled to relief.\u201d   Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d 472, 481\u201382 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nA well -pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 (2007).  A \nplaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson 2 v. City of Shelby , \u2013\u2013\u2013 U.S. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, 135 S.Ct. 346, 347 (2014).  A complaint may not be dismissed, \nhowever, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id.  at 346.  \n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true (even \nif doubtful in fact).\u2019\u201d   Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 555).  A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff  pleads factual content that allows \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  \nIqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  At bottom, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable \nexpectation that di scovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff \u2019s claim. \nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald asser tions,\u201d Morse v. \nLower Merion Sch. Dist. , 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \n\u201cunsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences,\u201d Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405, 417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \u201cself -\neviden tly false,\u201d Nami v. Fauver , 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1996).    \nBecause Plaintiff proceeds pro se , his pleading is liberally construed and his complaint, \n\u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint Lacks Any Factual Allegations \nTo plead a prima facie  case under the ADA, a plaintiff is required to show that (1) he is a \ndisabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and  3 (3) he has suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination.  \nWilliams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep\u2019t , 380 F.3d 751, 761 (3d Cir. 2004) (cleaned up) .  \nHere, as previously noted, in his Complaint Plaintiff failed to include any factual \nallegations at all.  Instead, in conclusory fashion, he asserts that he was discriminated against on the basis of an alleged disability in violation of the ADA and that he was terminated.  He fails, however, to set forth any specific supporting facts or any facts to connect these two statements.  As such, Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead a claim for discrimination under the ADA. \nB. Plaintiff Has Failed to Exhaust His Administrative Remedies  \nThe ADA requires exhaustion of administra tive remedies before a plaintiff may file a \ncomplaint in court.  Churchill v. Star Enterprises , 183 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 1999).  \u201cA party who \nbrings an employment discrimination action under Title I of the ADA must follow the administrative procedures set forth in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2013\n5.\u201d  Id. (citing Bishop v. Okidata, Inc., 864 F.Supp. 416, 424 (D.N.J.1994)).  Thus, prior to filing \na complaint in federal court, a party must first file an action with the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and wait 180 days to allow the EEOC to investigate and pursue the matter.   See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u20135(e)(1).  After 180 days, \u201c[i]f a complainant is \ndissatisfied with the progress the EEOC is making on his or her charge of employment discrimination, he or she may elect to circumvent the EEOC procedures and seek relief through a private enforcement action in a district court.\u201d  Occidental Life Ins. Co. Of California v. EEOC , \n432 U.S. 355, 361 (1977).  Thus, at the end of the 180- day period a plaintiff may request what is \ncommonly referred to as a \u201cright -to-sue\u201d letter from the EEOC, which the EEOC must issue upon \nrequest.   McNasby v. Crown Cork and Seal Co., 888 F.2d 270, 274 (3d Cir.1989).  Until a plaintiff \nhas pursued this administrative remedy, however, he may not file a lawsuit under Title I of the ADA.  4 Here, Plaintiff asserts that on March 28, 2019, he filed charges with the EEOC regarding \nDefendant \u2019s alleged  discriminatory conduct and that the EEOC issued the (purportedly) attached \n\u201cNotice of Right to Sue\u201d letter on January 14, 2021.  The letter attached to Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint, \nhowever, is not from the EEOC (a federal institution) but instead from the Delaware Department of Labor (a state institution).  There is no evidence that Plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies and thus, the Court grants Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on this ground as well. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.  As the Court \ncannot tell whether amendment would be futile ( i.e., whether Plaintiff has obtained but simply not \nattached the requisite EEOC letter and whether Plaintiff could plead the requisite facts supporting and ADA claim), the Court will dismiss the case without prejudice.   An appropriate order will \nissue.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nMELVIN A. L OWE, JR. , \n \n   Plaintiff,  \n  v.
