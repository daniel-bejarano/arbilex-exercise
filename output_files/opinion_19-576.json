Pro Se Petitioner.\n\nAndrew J. Vella, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, Wilmington,\nDelaware. Counsel for Respondents.\n\nFebruary 8, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nwohl ba DGE:\n\nPending before the Court is a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 filed by Bruce Rowan. (D.I. 1) The State filed an Answer in\nopposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 12; D.I. 17) For the reasons\ndiscussed, the Court will deny the Petition.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nIn January 2009, when [Petitioner] was 41 years old, he began\na sexual relationship with Jane Carson [a pseudonym], who\ntold [Petitioner] she was 23, but actually was 16 years old. In\nApril 2009 Carson became pregnant with [Petitioner's] child\nand [Petitioner] moved in with her. Shortly after becoming\npregnant, Carson told [Petitioner] her real age. [Petitioner]\nmoved out and began a relationship with another woman.\nCarson then contacted the police. After the baby was born, a\nDNA test confirmed that [Petitioner] is the father.\n\nOn October 30, 2009, [Petitioner] was arrested and arraigned\nat the police station via videophone connection with the\nJustice of the Peace Court. The court faxed [Petitioner] a\nbond form, which he signed, that included an order prohibiting\ncontact between [Petitioner] and Carson. [Petitioner] was\nincarcerated in default of $201,000 cash bail. He was indicted\non December 7, 2009, and the Superior Court issued a\nsummons ordering [Petitioner] to be present at his\narraignment on December 17, 2009. [Petitioner's] counsel\nwas not available on that date, and the arraignment was\npassed to the initial case review on December 28, 2009.\n\nOn December 22, 2009, [Petitioner] was released from prison\nbased on a disposition form submitted by the Court of\nCommon Pleas\u2014apparently in error. At the December 28\narraignment and case review, bond was set at $270,000 cash.\n[Petitioner] was unable to post bond and again was\nincarcerated. Neither the court nor the State addressed the\nno-contact order.\n\nRowan v. State, 45 A.3d 149 (Table), 2012 WL 1795829, at *1 (Del. May 16, 2012),\n\nrevised (May 18, 2012). In December 2010, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted\nPetitioner of continuous sexual abuse of a child, five counts of fourth degree rape, and\nfifty-six counts of breach of conditions of release. See State v. Rowan, 2017 WL\n5665032, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Nov. 21, 2017). On January 27, 2011, the Superior\nCourt sentenced Petitioner as a habitual offender to a total of 395 years of incarceration\nsuspended after serving 120 years, for probation. See id. The Delaware Supreme\nCourt affirmed Petitioner's convictions on direct appeal. See id.\n\nIn March 2013, Petitioner filed a pro se motion for post-conviction relief pursuant\nto Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d). (D.I. 12 at 2; D.I. 13-1\nat 5, Entry No. 52) The Superior Court rejected the Rule 61 motion as non-conforming.\nPetitioner filed a new pro se Rule 61 motion on May 15, 2013, and the Superior Court\nappointed counsel to represent Petitioner in his Rule 61 proceeding. (D.1. 12 at 2) On\nJuly 29, 2015, appointed postconviction counsel filed a non-merits memorandum of law\nand a motion to withdraw as counsel. A Delaware Superior Court Commissioner\ngranted postconviction counsel's motion to withdraw on October 27, 2015, and\nrecommended denying Petitioner's Rule 61 motion on November 21, 2017. See\nRowan, 2017 WL 5665032, at *6. The Superior Court adopted the Commissioner's\nReport and Recommendation, and denied the Rule 61 motion on April 13, 2018. (D.I.\n13-9 at 36) Petitioner appealed that decision pro se, and the Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed the Superior Court's decision on December 10, 2018. See Rowan v. State,\n\n198 A.3d 725 (Table), 2018 WL 6505996 (Del. Dec. 10, 2018).\nI. | GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(\u2018AEDPA\u2019) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences . .\n. and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d Woodford v. Garceau,\n538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas\npetition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of\nthe Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).\nAdditionally, AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for analyzing the\nmerits of a habeas petition in order to \u201cprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure\nthat state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d Bell v.\nCone, 535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002).\nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v.\nConnor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\nshall not be granted unless it appears that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the\ncourts of the State; or\n\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective\nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such process\nineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of comity,\ngives \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking\none complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan,\n526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the\nhabeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct\nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court\nto consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005);\nCastille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised the issue on direct\nappeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted and the petitioner does\nnot need to raise the same issue again in a state post-conviction proceeding. See\nLambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and further\nstate court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the federal\ncourt will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted. See\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet[] the\ntechnical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer available);\nsee also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims, however, are\nprocedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153,\n160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state\u2019s\nhighest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the merits of the\nclaim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted\nbut procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S.\n\n4\n255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims\nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if\nthe court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260\n(3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause for a procedural\ndefault, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor external to the defense\nimpeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier,\n477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show that\nthe errors during his trial created more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that\nthe errors worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial\nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d /d. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d! then a federal court\ncan excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451\n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). The miscarriage of justice\nexception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means factual\ninnocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623\n(1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual innocence by asserting\n\u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy\n\neyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u2014that was not presented at trial,\u201d\n\nIMurray, 477 U.S. at 496.\nshowing that no reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt. See Hubbard v. Pinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nC. Standard of Review\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the\nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if\nthe state court's decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts\nbased on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see Williams\nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn, 250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001). A\nclaim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d) if the state\ncourt decision finally resolved the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a\nprocedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir.\n2009). The deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s order is\nunaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cit\nmay be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the\nabsence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d /d. at 99.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the\nstate court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This\npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is\nonly rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1);\n\n6\nCampbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S.\n322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies\nto factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2)\napplies to factual decisions).\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nPetitioner asserts three Claims in his timely-filed Petition: (1) there was\ninsufficient evidence to convict him of fourth degree rape (D.I. 3 at 17) and violating the\nconditions of his release (D.I. 3 at 25); (2) defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to object to the absence of a jury instruction about \u201cmistake of\nage/fraudulent concealment\u201d; and (3) Petitioner was denied his Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel when he was not advised of any conditions related to his mistaken release\nfrom prison on December 22, 2009.\n\nA. Claim One: Insufficient Evidence of Intent\n\nIn Claim One, Petitioner asserts that the State presented insufficient evidence of\nhis intent for the fourth degree rape charges and the breach of conditions of release\ncharges. The Delaware Supreme Court denied slight variations of these arguments in\nPetitioner's direct and post-conviction appeals, and implicitly held that there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support Petitioner's convictions.2, Consequently, Claim One will\n\nOn direct appeal, Petitioner argued that his breach of conditions convictions should be\nset aside because the no-contact condition had been implicitly discharged. See Rowan,\n2012 WL 1795829, at *1. The Delaware Supreme Court rejected the argument as\nfactually and legally meritless. /d. Petitioner raised the argument again in his Rule 61\nproceeding, and both the Superior and Delaware Supreme Courts rejected it as formerly\nadjudicated under Rule 61(i)(4). See Rowan, 2018 WL 6505996, at *2. Petitioner\nchallenged his fourth degree rape conviction in his Rule 61 proceeding by arguing that\nCarson\u2019s fraudulent concealment of her age created a reasonable doubt of his guilt.\n\n7\nonly warrant relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decisions were either contrary to, or\nan unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. See Orie v. Sec\u2019y Pa.\nDep't Corr., 940 F.3d 845, 854 (3d Cir. 2019) (noting that habeas deference is\nwarranted when the state court's ruling implicitly addressed the merits of the petitioner's\nconstitutional argument).\n\nThe United States Supreme Court precedent governing Petitioner's insufficient\nevidence claim is Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Pursuant to Jackson, \u201cthe\nrelevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d /d. at 319. This standard \u201cmust be applied with\nexplicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state\nlaw.\u201d Id. at 324 n.16. Additionally, \u201ca federal habeas court faced with a record of\nhistorical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume \u2014 even if it does not\naffirmatively appear in the record \u2014 that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in\nfavor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u201d /d. at 326. Itis not\nnecessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\nId.\n\nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, a \u201cstate court decision is\ncontrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the\ngoverning law set forth in Supreme Court precedent, or if it confronts a set of facts that\n\nare materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme] Court and\n\nSee Rowan, 2018 WL 6505996, at *2. Both the Superior and Delaware Supreme\nCourts rejected that argument. See id.\n8\nnevertheless arrives at a result different from that reached by the Supreme Court.\u201d Eley\nv. Erickson, 712 F.3d 837, 846 (3d Cir. 2013). In this case, the Delaware Supreme\nCourt did not specifically identify or apply Jackson and its progeny when implicitly\nholding that there was sufficient evidence to support Petitioner's convictions for fourth\ndegree rape and breach of conditions of release. Nevertheless, the Delaware Supreme\nCourt's decision was not contrary to Jackson, because the Delaware Supreme Court\nproperly reviewed the evidence in a manner consistent with Jackson.\n\nThe Court's inquiry is not over, however, because it must also determine if the\nDelaware state courts reasonably applied Jackson when denying Petitioner's instant\narguments. The Court will review Petitioner's arguments in seriatim.\n\n1. Fourth degree rape\n\nAccording to Petitioner, there was insufficient evidence to convict him of fourth\ndegree rape because the State did not prove that he knew Carson was under 18 years\nof age when he engaged in sexual relations with her. (D.I. 3 at 14) He asserts that\nCarson and her family \u201cfraudulently concealed\u201d her true age and he was prevented from\nasserting the defense that he believed Carson was 23 years old. (/d. at 16)\n\nIn order for a jury to convict Petitioner of fourth degree rape, the State had to establish\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he was 30 years of age or older when he intentionally\nhad sexual intercourse with Carson when she was under 18 years old. See 11 Del.\nCode \u00a7 770(a)(2). Contrary to Petitioner's contention, the State was not required to\nprove that he intended to engage in a sexual relationship with an underage victim while\n\nknowing the victim was underage. In fact, 11 Del. Code \u00a7 454 provides, in relevant part:\n[I]t is no defense for an offense or sentencing provision\ndefined in this title or in Title 16 or 31 which has as an element\nof such offense or sentencing provision the age of the victim\nthat the accused did not know the age of the victim or\nreasonably believed the person to be of an age which would\nnot meet the element of such offense or sentencing provision\nunless the statute defining such offense or sentencing\nprovision or a statute directly related thereto expressly\nprovides that knowledge of the victim's age is an element of\nthe offense or that lack of such knowledge is a defense.\n11 Del. Code \u00a7 454 (2010).\n\nThe jury in Petitioner's case was presented with the following evidence: (1)\nCarson's testimony that she engaged in sexual intercourse with then 41-year old\nPetitioner when she was 16 years old; (2) Carson\u2019s testimony that she became\npregnant with Petitioner's child; and (3) DNA testing and analysis confirming that\nPetitioner is the father of Jane\u2019s child. Pursuant to well-settled Delaware law, \u201ca victim's\ntestimony alone, concerning alleged sexual contact, is sufficient to support a guilty\nverdict if it establishes every element of the offense charged.\u201d Farmer v. State, 844\nA.2d 297, 300 (Del. 2004). After viewing the aforementioned evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court\nreasonably held that the record provided sufficient evidence from which a rational jury\ncould have concluded that Petitioner intentionally engaged in sexual intercourse with a\nvictim that was under 18 years of age when Petitioner was over 30 years of age.\n\n2. Breach of conditions of release\nTo reiterate, on October 30, 2009, a no-contact order was issued prohibiting\n\nPetitioner from contacting Carson. \u201cWhile not entirely clear, the record reflects that\n\nwhen [Petitioner] appeared for a [Court of Common Pleas (\u201cCCP\u201d)] preliminary hearing\n\n10\nand bond review, his $201,000 cash bail set by the J.P. Court remained in effect, but no\none addressed the J.P. Court no-contact between [Petitioner] and the minor victim.\nFollowing an apparent error by CCP in its disposition form, [Petitioner] was mistakenly\nreleased pretrial from prison on December 22, 2009. Shortly thereafter, on December\n28, 2009 at his Superior Court arraignment, [Petitioner's] bond was raised to $270,000\ncash and he was re-incarcerated. At that time, [nJeither the court nor the State\naddressed the no-contact order.\u201d (D.I. 13-8 at 16) Thereafter, while incarcerated,\nPetitioner contacted Carson via telephone, and he was subsequently charged with 56\ncounts of breach of condition for release. (/d.)\n\nIn this sub-argument of Claim One, Petitioner asserts that the State failed to\nprove he \u201cintentionally and knowingly violated [his conditions of release] by contacting\nthe victim\u201d after his arraignment on December 28, 2009 and second commitment to\ncustody. (D.I. 3 at 25,27) Although Petitioner acknowledges that he repeatedly\ncontacted Carson's parents and grandmother by cailing their home phone number, he\ncontends that Carson \u201cwould insist upon talking to [him]\u201d and \u201cchose to forcefully\ncommunicate with [him] every time he called the house, or by mail.\u201d (D.1. 3 at 26)\nPetitioner also contends that his convictions for violating the conditions of release\nshould be reversed because his release from pretrial detention on December 22, 2009\nimplicitly discharged the original no-contact condition of bond and the no-contact\ncondition was not explicitly re-imposed for his second commitment following his\nDecember 28, 2009 arraignment.\n\nOn direct appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court rejected as meritless Petitioner's\nargument that the no-contact condition in the first bond was implicitly discharged when\n\n11\nthe Superior Court set a $270,000 cash bond without explicitly re-imposing or\ndiscussing any conditions from his first bond. See Rowan 2012 WL 1795829, at *1-2.\nThe Superior Court rejected this same argument in his Rule 61 proceeding, holding that\n\u201cit was without a legal basis and that it essentially asked the Court to nullify Delaware\nstatutes which prescribed [Petitioner's] conduct. This claim is frivolous.\u201d Rowan, 2017\nWL 5665032, at *5. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision, stating that it\nfound \u201cno error of law or abuse of discretion.\u201d Rowan, 2018 WL 6505996, at *2.\n\nIn order for the jury to convict Petitioner of breaching the conditions of release,\nthe State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner knowingly breached\nany condition of bond imposed in connection with his bail. See 11 Del. Code \u00a7 2109.\nDuring Petitioner's trial, the jury was presented with Carson\u2019s testimony that she\nreceived two to three calls per week from Petitioner while he was incarcerated after\nDecember 28, 2009. (D.I. 13-2 at 135-36) Many of these prison phone calls were\nrecorded and played at trial. (D.I. 13-2 at 200-208)\n\nThe Court rejects Petitioner's two arguments as to why he believes the State\nfailed to establish the elements of the \u201cbreach of conditions of release\u201d offenses. First,\nthe no-contact statute \u2014 \u00a7 2109(a) \u2014 provides: \u201cIf the defendant is committed in lieu of\nbail, the court may require such defendant, while in custody, to have no contact with the\nvictim or the victim's family.\u201d 11 Del. Code \u00a7 2019(a). Since the language of \u00a7 2109\nfocuses on the defendant's actions, not the victim\u2019s, Carson's reactions to Petitioner's\nphone calls did not excuse or vitiate Petitioner's state of mind of knowingly or\n\nintentionally violating the no-contact order.\n\n12\nSecond, on direct appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court explicitly rejected as\nfactually and legally meritless Petitioner's contention that the Superior Court implicitly\ndischarged the prohibitions in the original no-contact order during his December 28,\n2009 arraignment by failing to explicitly reinstate those prohibitions when it imposed a\n$270,000 cash bond:\n\n[Petitioner] offers no authority for his position, which ignores\nboth the facts and the law. When he was arraigned on\nDecember 28, 2009, the State asked the court to reinstate the\nbond that had been imposed by the Justice of the Peace\nCourt. Although there was no discussion about the conditions\nof the original bond, there is nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the no-contact order was not included in the reinstated\nbond. Thus, the suggestion that the no-contact condition was\ndischarged is not supported by the facts.\n\n[Petitioner's] argument also fails as a matter of law. When a\nperson is charged with a crime involving child sexual abuse,\nthe court must impose a no-contact condition, \u201cexcept upon\ngood cause shown,\u201d and that condition remains in effect \u201cuntil\na nolle prosequi is filed, the case is dismissed or an\nadjudication of not guilty is returned...\u201d This statutory\nmandate requires that a no-contact order remain in place,\nexcept upon order of the court \u201cfor good cause shown,\u201d until\none of the three listed events occurs. There was no court\norder removing the condition, and the charges against\n[Petitioner] were not dismissed or nolle prossed. Thus,\nthe condition continued in effect.\n\nRowan, 2012 WL 1795829, at *1-2 (emphasis added). The Court must accept as\ncorrect the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s factual determination, because nothing in the\nrecord or Petitioner's submissions in this proceeding clearly and convincingly rebut the\nstate court's determination that the Superior Court's silence did not act to discharge the\noriginal no-contact prohibitions. See \u00a7 2254(d)(2); \u00a7 2254(e)(1). The Court also must\n\ndefer to the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation and application of Delaware\n\n13\nstatutory law, because state law issues are not reviewable in federal habeas\nproceedings. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991) (reiterating that \u201cit is\nnot the province of federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on\nstate-law questions.\u201d) Thus, after viewing the aforementioned evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, and given the Court's rejections of Petitioner's arguments\nregarding the lack of intent, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court\nreasonably held that the record provided sufficient evidence from which a rational jury\ncould have concluded that Petitioner violated the conditions of his release.\n\nAnd finally, while the Court does not view Petitioner's challenge to his \u201cbreach of\nconditions\u201d convictions as challenging the Delaware Supreme Court's holding on due\nprocess grounds, even if it should be construed in this fashion, the foregoing analysis\ndemonstrates that Petitioner has failed to show that the Delaware Supreme Court's\nruling \u201cwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86 103 (2011).\n\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim One in its entirety for failing to satisfy the\nstandard articulated in \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nB. Claim Two: Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\nIn Claim Two, Petitioner argues that defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by failing \u201cto move the trial court for a reasonable doubt instruction based\nupon fraudulent concealment by the victim.\u201d (D.I. 3 at 17) The Delaware Supreme\nCourt denied the instant ineffective assistance of counsel argument on post-conviction\nappeal. Therefore, Claim Two will only warrant federal habeas relief if the Delaware\n\n14\nSupreme Court's decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510\n(2003). Under the first Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel's\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with\nreasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel\nrendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second Strickland prong,\na petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel's error the result would have been different.\u201d /d. at 687-96. A reasonable\nprobability is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d /d. at\n688. A court many deny an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by only deciding one\nof the Strickland prongs. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697.\n\nIn order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must\nmake concrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk summary\ndismissal. See Wells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991); Dooley v.\nPetsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1987). Although not insurmountable, the\nStrickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a \u201cstrong presumption that the\nrepresentation was professionally reasonable.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that the\nDelaware Supreme Court correctly identified the Strickland standard as governing\nPetitioner's instant ineffective assistance of counsel contention. See State v. Woodlin,\n\n15\n2017 WL 6948353, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. July 8, 2017). As a result, the Delaware\nSupreme Court's decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law.\n\nThe Court must also determine if the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably\napplied the Strickland standard to the facts of Petitioner's case. See Harrington, 562\nU.S. at 105-06. When performing this inquiry, the Court must review the Delaware\nSupreme Court's denial of Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel allegations\nthrough a \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens. /d. \u201c[T]he question is not whether counsel's actions\nwere reasonable, [but rather], whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel\nsatisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d /d. When assessing prejudice under\nStrickland, the question is \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result would have been\ndifferent\u201d but for counsel's performance, and the \u2018likelihood of a different result must be\nsubstantial, not just conceivable.\u201d /d. And finally, when viewing a state court's\ndetermination that a Strickland claim lacks merit through the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal\nhabeas relief is precluded \u201cso long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the\ncorrectness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d /d. at 101.\n\nIn this case, the Delaware Supreme Court found that Petitioner \u201cwas not\nprejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to advance a defense based on the alleged\n\u2018fraudulent concealment\u2019 of the victim\u2019s age by the victim and her parents.\u201d Rowan,\n2018 WL 6505996, at *2. Considering that mistake as to age is not a defense to fourth\ndegree rape under Delaware law,\u00b0 the Court cannot conclude that Delaware Supreme\nCourt unreasonably applied Strickland by finding a lack of prejudice. Similarly, defense\n\ncounsel's failure to request a jury instruction on a non-existent defense did not fall below\n\n3See Del. Code \u00a7 454; State v. Phiipot, 64 A.3d 856, 861 (Del. Super. Ct. 2012)\n16\nobjective standards of professional reasonableness. Thus, the Court will deny Claim\nTwo for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nTo the extent the Court should liberally construe Claim Two as also asserting a\nstand-alone claim alleging that the Superior Court violated Petitioner's due process\nrights by refusing to instruct the jury on a \u201cmistake of age/fraudulent concealment\u2019\ndefense, the argument is similarly unavailing. As a general rule, claims involving jury\ninstructions in state criminal trials are matters of state law, and are only cognizable on\nfederal habeas review if the instructions are so fundamentally unfair that they deprive\nthe petitioner of a fair trial and due process. See Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145,\n154 (1977); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107 (1982); Estelle, 502 U.S. at 71-72 (\u2018[T]he fact\nthat [an] instruction was allegedly incorrect under state law is not a basis for habeas\nrelief.\u201d). The relevant question on habeas review is \u201cwhether the ailing instruction by\nitself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violated due process ..., not\nmerely whether the instruction is undesirable, erroneous, or even universally\ncondemned.\u201d Martin v. Warden, Huntingdon State Correctional Inst., 653 F.2d 799, 809\n(3d Cir.1981). An \u201cerror of state law in [jury] instructions\u201d will only be \u201cmeaningful in [a]\nhabeas corpus action\u201d if there is \u201ca federal requirement that jury instructions on the\nelements of an offense [...] must include particular provisions,\u201d or the petitioner\n\u201cdemonstrate[s] that the jury instructions deprived him of a defense which federal law\nprovided to him.\u201d Johnson v. Rosemeyer, 117 F.3d 104, 111 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nAs previously explained, Petitioner's \u201cmistake of age/fraudulent concealment\u201d\ndefense is not recognized as a matter of Delaware state law. There also is no clearly\nestablished federal right to a jury instruction on a \u201cmistake of age/fraudulent\n\n17\nconcealment\u201d defense to a charge of sexual intercourse with a minor. See United\nStates v. Wilcox, 487 F.3d 1163, 1174 (8 Cir. 2007) (\u2018federal courts uniformly have\nrejected claims [...] that such a defendant has a constitutional right to the defense that\nhe made a reasonable mistake as to the victim's age.\u201d) (collecting cases); see also\nMorissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 251 n.8 (1951) (noting that common-law\ncommentators recognize statutory rape as an exception to general principles of criminal\nintent); United States v. Brooks, 841 F.2d 268, 269-70 (9\"\" Cir. 1988) (federal\nconstitution does not require that statutory rape defendant be allowed to assert defense\nof reasonable misstate of fact as to the victim's age). Thus, to the extent Petitioner\nchallenges the correctness of the Superior Court's failure to instruct the jury on a\n\u201cmistake of age/fraudulent concealment\u201d defense, he has failed to present an issue\ncognizable on federal habeas review.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Two as meritless.\n\nC. Claim Three: Sixth Amendment Denial of Counsel\n\nIn his final Claim, Petitioner contends that the absence of counsel overseeing his\nDecember 22, 2009 release and/or counsel's failure to inform him that the no-contact\nprohibition in his October 2009 order remained in effect even after his December 22,\n2009 release constituted a breakdown in the adversarial process as described in United\nStates v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984). (D.I. 3 at 29-31) The State contends that Claim\nThree should be dismissed as procedurally barred due to Petitioner's failure to exhaust\nstate remedies. The Court is not persuaded. While not entirely clear, it appears that\nPetitioner's Rule 61 motion only challenged the trial court\u2019s failure to dismiss the breach\nof conditions charges and did not present any argument concerning defense counsel\u2019s\n\n18\nabsence and/or performance with respect to the breach of conditions charges. On post-\nconviction appeal, however, Petitioner did argue that his counsel\u2019s failure in December\n2009 to specifically inform him that the no-contact order imposed on October 30, 2009\nremained in effect until his trial amounted to per se ineffectiveness under Cronic. (D..\n13-7 at 25-30; D.I. 13-8 at 15, 17) The Delaware Supreme Court concurred with the\nSuperior Court's conclusion that Petitioner's challenge to his breach of conditions\nconvictions was barred for being formerly adjudicated, but did not address the Cronic\nargument in its decision affirming the Superior Court's judgment. This Court has\nconsistently held that the Delaware state courts\u2019 dismissal of a claim as barred under\nRule 61(i)(4)'s \u201cformer adjudication\u201d standard constitutes an adjudication on the merits\nfor federal habeas purposes. See Trice v. Pierce, 2016 WL 2771123, at *4 n.4 (D. Del.\nMay 13, 2016); Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. 449, 466 (2009) (\u201cA claim is procedurally barred\nwhen it has not been fairly presented to the state courts for their initial consideration \u2014\nnot when the claim has been presented more than once.\u201d). Given these circumstances,\nthe Court will review Claim Three under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to determine if the Delaware state\ncourts\u2019 denial of the Claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished federal law.\n\nAs a general rule, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are reviewed pursuant\nto the two-pronged standard established in Strickland, namely, whether defense\ncounsel's actions constituted deficient performance and whether the petitioner was\nprejudiced by that performance. See supra at Section III.B. In United States v. Cronic,\nhowever, the United States Supreme Court articulated a very limited exception to\nStrickland's prejudice requirement, holding that there are three situations in which\n\n19\nprejudice caused by an attorney's performance will be presumed: where the defendant\nis completely denied counsel at a critical stage; where \u201ccounsel entirely fails to subject\nthe prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing;\u201d or where the circumstances\nare such that there is an extremely small likelihood that even a competent attorney\ncould provide effective assistance, such as when the opportunity for cross-examination\nhas been eliminated. Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659 & n. 25. With respect to exception two,\nthe Cronic presumption of prejudice only applies when counsel has completely failed to\ntest the prosecution's case throughout the entire trial. See Bell, 535 U.S. at 697.\n\nIn this proceeding, Petitioner contends that \u201cthe record is void of any counsel\nassuring [that Petitioner] understood his release on December 22, 2009 came with\nconditions imposed by the court [...]. Nothing in the \u00a7 2104(b) order shows [Petitioner]\nhad counsel or whether he signed any conditions for his release after October 30 2009.\u201d\n(D.I. 3 at 30) Specifically, he argues:\n\n[I]t is difficult to imagine a more prejudicial course for the State\nto deny counsel altogether then claim [Petitioner] breached\nthe conditions of his release 56 times knowing he had no\n\ncounsel on December 22, 2009 to inform him of the court\u2019s\nnew \u00a7 2104(b) conditions imposed before his release.\n\n* * *\n\nThe court and State relied upon the conditions imposed by the\nJ.P Court while [Petitioner] was incarcerated. However, the\nSuperior Court was required by \u00a7 2104(b) to hold a second\nbond hearing and impose \u201cnew conditions of release\u201d in\nconjunction with \u00a7 2108 when [Petitioner] was subsequently\nreleased by mistake. So, [Petitioner] could not have relied\nupon the J.P. court's \u201cconditions\u201d imposed because he was\nreleased by the Superior Court without conditions \u00a7 2104(b)\nand without ever seeing a \u201cbreach of conditions for release\nagreement\u201d in Superior Court.\u201d\n\n(D.1. 3 at 33-34)\n20\nThe Court construes Petitioner's convoluted assertions as presenting two\npossible arguments. In his first argument, Petitioner contends that the absence of\ncounsel on December 22, 2009 \u2014 the day of his mistaken release \u2014 deprived him of his\nSixth Amendment right to defend against the charges against him and created a\n\u201cbreakdown in the adversarial process\u201d as contemplated in Cronic. (D.1. 3 at 32, citing\nCronic, 466 U.S. at 662). The Court liberally construes this subargument of Claim\nThree as either alleging that defense counsel\u2019s physical absence at the time of his\nrelease or the Superior Court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel to oversee his release\nconstituted a complete denial of counsel during a critical stage of his trial warranting an\nautomatic reversal of his convictions for breaching the conditions of release.\nPetitioner's argument is unavailing. Notably, nothing in the record indicates that\nPetitioner appeared before a court on December 22, 2009. Instead, it appears that\nPetitioner was directly (but mistakenly) released from prison on that day, and he did not\nappear before a court again until December 28, 2009 for a bond hearing in the Superior\nCourt. (D.I. 13-2 at 73) Since Petitioner's release from prison on December 22, 2009\nwas not a part of his criminal proceeding, he cannot demonstrate that he was deprived\ncounsel during one of Cronic\u2019s critical stages.\n\nEven if the release on December 22, 2009 should be considered significant for\npurposes of a Cronic analysis, or if Petitioner did not mean to identify December 22,\n2009 as the relevant event but, rather, some other court appearance that occurred\nbetween October 2009 and December 28, 2009, Petitioner must demonstrate that the\nabsence of counsel and/or counsel's failure to apprise him that the condition of his\nOctober 2009 no-contact order continued up until trial, affected the reliability of the trial\n\n21\nprocess, and/or resulted in a failure to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to adversarial\ntesting. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659-67; see also Ditch v. Grace, 479 F.3d 249, 256 (3d\nCir. 2007) (clarifying that the Cronic presumption of prejudice applies only in cases\nwhere the denial of counsel necessarily undermines the reliability of the entire criminal\nproceeding and, therefore, does not necessarily apply to the denial of counsel during a\ndefendant's arraignment.) (emphasis added). Petitioner has failed to satisfy this\nburden. The record demonstrates that defense counsel tried the case and defended\nPetitioner against all the charges in the indictment, including the several counts alleging\nbreach of conditions of release. Defense counsel's success in obtaining acquittals for\nten counts of fourth degree rape demonstrates that defense counsel held the State to its\nburden of proof. Thus, defense counsel's absence on December 22, 2009 and/or\ncounsel's failure to inform Petitioner about the continuing condition of his October 2009\nno-contact order on December 22, 2009 did not undermine the reliability of Petitioner's\nentire criminal proceeding.\n\nPetitioner's second argument is not premised on Cronic. Instead, Petitioner\nappears to argue that his release from prison on December 22, 2009 implicitly\ndischarged the no-contact condition that had been imposed as part of his October 2009\n\u201cNo Contact/Conditions of Release\u201d Order. He contends that the Superior Court was\nrequired to explicitly re-impose the no-contact condition during his December 28, 2009\nbond hearing, and the fact that the Superior Court did not do so meant that he was not\nbound by a no-contact condition after December 28, 2009.\n\nPetitioner's argument is unavailing. Neither his mistaken release on December\n22, 2009 nor the Superior Court's failure to explicitly re-impose the no-contact condition\n\n22\non December 28, 2009 acted to discharge the no-contact condition that had been\nimposed in October 2009. Courts in Delaware are statutorily required to impose a no-\ncontact condition when granting any form of bail for defendants charged with a crime\ninvolving child sexual abuse or exploitation, and, \u201cexcept upon good cause shown,\u201d the\nno-contact condition remains in effect \u201cuntil a nolle prosequi is filed, the case is\ndismissed or an adjudication of not guilty is returned, whichever shall first occur, or if the\ndefendant is adjudicated guilty by way of a plea of guilty or a conviction by court or jury,\nat the time of sentencing.\u201d 11 Del. Code \u00a7 2108(b). Once again, as the Delaware\nSupreme Court held on direct appeal, \u201cThere was no court order removing the\ncondition, and the charges against [Petitioner] were not dismissed or nolle prossed.\nThus, the condition continued in effect.\u201d Rowan, 2012 WL 1795829, at *2. Notably,\nPetitioner does not argue that he could have shown \u201cgood cause\u201d for the court to\nremove the no-contact condition, and he never sought relief from the no-contact order\nduring the pendency of his criminal charges.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Court concludes that Claim Three does not warrant\nrelief.\n\nD. Pending Motions\n\nPetitioner filed the following two motions during the pendency of this proceeding:\n(1) a Motion to Amend the Petition to include a claim that defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to object to the Superior Court's use of the term \u201cvictim\u201d\nin the jury instructions (D.1. 19 at 1); and (2) a Motion to Stay the Proceedings to provide\nPetitioner with an opportunity to return to state court to present his argument that 11\nDel. Code \u00a7 770 unconstitutionally prohibits a defendant from presenting a \u201cmistake of\n\n23\nage/fraudulent concealment\u201d defense to a charge of fourth degree rape (D.I. 22-1 at 1).\n\nAlthough Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Amend describes the claim he wishes to add to\nthe Petition as challenging the Superior Court's use of the term \u201cvictim\u201d in the jury\ninstructions, the essence of this \u201cnew\u201d argument merely reasserts Petitioner's\ncontention that he was denied his due process right to present a\u201d mistake of\nage/fraudulent concealment\u201d defense during his trial. (D.I. 19 at 3-10) The Court has\nalready considered and rejected this argument with respect to Claim Two. Therefore,\nthe Court will deny Petitioner's request to amend his Petition with this duplicative\nargument.\n\nAs for Petitioner's Motion to Stay, a federal habeas court is only authorized to\nstay a habeas proceeding if a habeas petition contains both exhausted and\nunexhausted claims, and the petitioner's ability to file a future habeas petition after\nproper exhaustion in the state courts will be clearly foreclosed by the expiration of\nAEDPA's one-year filing period. See Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269 (2005); Pliler v.\nFord, 542 U.S. 225 (2004). The instant Petition does not contain any unexhausted\nclaims. In addition, the Court has already considered and rejected the \u201cnew\u201d argument\nPetitioner wishes to present to the Delaware courts (namely, that \u00a7 770\nunconstitutionally prevents a defendant from presenting a \u201cmistake of age/fraudulent\nconcealment\u201d defense) in its analysis for Claim Two, and nothing in the Motion to Stay\nwould change the Court's determination that Petitioner's \u201cnew\u201d challenge lacks merit.\nAs previously discussed, there is no clearly established federal right to a jury instruction\non a \u201cmistake of age/fraudulent concealment\u201d defense to a charge of sexual intercourse\nwith a minor. See supra Section III.B. In addition, the Delaware Supreme Court has\n\n24\nalready upheld the constitutionality of 11 Del. Code \u00a7 762(a), which \u201cexplicitly precludes\na defense based on the defendant's reasonable belief that the victim had reached the\nage of consent\u201d for sexual offenses. Pritchard v. State, 842 A.2d 1244 (Table), 2004\nWL 249419, at *1 (Del. Feb. 4, 2004). Thus, the Court will deny Petitioner's request to\nstay the instant proceeding to re-litigate a previously determined issue.\n\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide\nwhether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. LA.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2253(c)(2). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a\n\u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat\nreasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims\ndebatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,\n484 (2000).\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief.\nReasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the\nCourt will not issue a certificate of appealability.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the instant Petition and\n\nMotions must be denied. An appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n25\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nBRUCE ROWAN,\nPetitioner,\nVv.
