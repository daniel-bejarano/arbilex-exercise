Civil Action No. 19-2240-CFC-SRF\nMONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC., ;\nDefendant\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPresently before the court in this patent infringement action are three pending motions:\n(1) plaintiff Volterra Semiconductor LLC\u2019s (\u201cVolterra\u201d) motion for leave to serve amended\ninfringement contentions (D.I. 164); (2) defendant Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\u2019s\n(\u201cMonolithic\u201d) motion for leave to file a sur-reply brief in opposition to Volterra\u2019s motion for\nleave to amend (D.I. 190); and (3) Monolithic\u2019s motion for leave to serve amended invalidity\ncontentions (D.I. 239).' For the following reasons, Volterra\u2019s motion for leave to serve amended\ninfringement contentions is GRANTED, Monolithic\u2019s motion for leave to file a sur-reply brief is\nDENIED, and Monolithic\u2019s motion for leave to serve amended invalidity contentions is\nGRANTED.\u201d\nOH. BACKGROUND\n\nVolterra is a developer of low-voltage power delivery solutions. (D.I. 71 at 4 13)\nMonolithic is a provider of electronics, including DC-to-DC power converters. (/d. at ]6) On\n' The briefing and declarations associated with the pending motions are found at D.I. 165, D.I.\n166, D.I. 177, D.I. 178, D.I. 180, D.I. 181, D.I. 200, D.I. 240, D.I. 248, D.I. 249, and D.I. 256.\n2 In a November 18, 2021 letter to the court, Volterra confirmed its withdrawal of its opposition\n\nto Monolithic\u2019s motion for leave to serve amended invalidity contentions. (D.I. 267) The court\ngrants Monolithic\u2019s motion to amend on this basis and does not reach the merits of the motion.\nDecember 9, 2019, Volterra brought this action for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,362,986\n(\u201cthe \u2019986 patent\u201d), 7,525,408 (\u201cthe \u2019408 patent\u201d), and 7,772,955 (\u201cthe 955 patent;\u201d collectively,\nthe \u201cAsserted Patents\u201d). (D.I. 1) In the complaint, Volterra accused Monolithic\u2019s DC-to-DC\npower converters of infringing the Asserted Patents. (/d. at] 18) In particular, Volterra\nidentified as a \u201cnon-exhaustive example\u201d the 48V-1V Power Solution for CPU, SoC or ASIC\nController (the \u201c48V-1V\u201d) that Monolithic demonstrated at the 2019 IEEE Applied Power\nElectronics Conference and Exposition (the \u201cAPEC 2019\u201d). (/d.) The 48V-1V is a two-phase\nDC-to-DC power converter with coupled inductors. (D.[. 71 at {] 46(d), 78) The Asserted\nPatents are directed to DC-to-DC converters with coupled inductive windings and methods for\nmaking those windings. (D.I. 244 at 1) The 986 patent has a March 22, 2001 priority date, and\n\nthe \u2019955 and \u00b0408 patents have a priority date of December 13, 2002. (D.I. 71, Exs. A-C)\n\nIn June 2020, Monolithic objected to the breadth and lack of specificity of Volterra\u2019s\npleaded accusations against Monolithic\u2019s entire DC-to-DC power converter line of products.\n\n(D.I. 37; D.I. 38) Volterra served written discovery requests and the second amended complaint\n(\u201cSAC\u201d) in September 2020,\u2019 limiting the realm of accused products to the 48V-1V and other\nsubstantially similar products. (D.I. 166, Ex. C at 1, 4; D.I. 71 at \u00a7 18) Volterra\u2019s initial\ninfringement contentions served on October 14, 2020 also defined the accused products as the\n48V-1V and \u201cany other substantially similar products.\u201d (D.I. 166, Ex. B) In response to\nVolterra\u2019s narrowed discovery requests, Monolithic identified only the 48V-1V as the Accused\nProduct. (D.I. 166, Ex. D at 6)\n\nOn October 30, 2020, Monolithic produced a specification from i.\nGE. 2 coupled inductor manufacturer, that indicated the Jj product was\n(D1. 166, Ex. E at MPS_DE-00000917) Volterra highlighted this\ndocument in a December 17, 2020 letter to Monolithic, noting \u201c[i]t . . . appears that [Monolithic]\ndeveloped a Power Solution with Nvidia that utilizes coupled inductors in a substantially similar\nmanner as the products demonstrated at APEC 2019....\u201d (D.I. 178, Ex. A) Monolithic\nresponded on December 23, 2020, stating that the NVIDIA version of the 48V-1V (the \u201cNVIDIA\nPower Solution\u201d) was the only version of the Accused Product that was available to the public at\nthat time, and no other versions of the Accused Product were available to Monolithic customers.\n(D.I. 166, Ex. A)\n\nIn its second set of discovery requests served in January 2021, Volterra specifically\nsought discovery on the NVIDIA Power Solution. (DJ. 166, Exs. H & I) A subsequent letter\nfrom Monolithic dated January 25, 2021 retracted Monolithic\u2019s previous representation that\n\ncertain technical documents produced in discovery were attributable to the NVIDIA Power\n\n3 Monolithic moved to dismiss the SAC on October 9, 2020. (D.I. 83) On September 30, 2021,\nthe District Judge entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting-in-part and denying-in-\npart the motion to dismiss. (D.I. 244; D.I. 245) Specifically, the Court granted the motion to\ndismiss with respect to the allegations of contributory infringement and denied the motion in all\nother respects. (D.I. 244 at 15)\nSolution. (D.I. 166, Ex. J at 1) Monolithic also responded to Volterra\u2019s second set of discovery\nrequests, indicating that it could not produce certain responsive documents until it first obtained\nthe consent of various third parties. (D.I. 166, Ex. S at 8-9)\n\nMonolithic produced technical documents and correspondence responsive to Volterra\u2019s\nsecond set of discovery requests between mid-April and mid-May 2021. (D.I. 166, Exs. M-O)\nOn May 28, 2021, Volterra served its proposed amended infringement contentions on\nMonolithic. (D.I. 166, Ex. R) The amended infringement contentions discuss the NVIDIA\nPower Solution, relying on Bates-numbered technical documents and communications from the\nproductions made in April and May 2021 to map the NVIDIA Power Solution to the claim\nelements of the Asserted Patents. (/d.)\n\nClaim construction briefing concluded on June 21, 2021. (D.I. 168) Discovery closed on\nAugust 6, 2021. (D.I. 69 at { 9(a)) Opening expert reports were exchanged on September 17,\n2021, and rebuttal reports were exchanged on October 1, 2021. (D.I. 237; D.I. 246) A Markman\nhearing was held on November 12, 2021. (10/4/2021 Oral Order) Pursuant to the parties\u2019 joint\nstipulation, the deadline to file case dispositive motions was extended to November 19, 2021.\n(D.I. 251) The pretrial conference and trial dates set in the original scheduling order have been\nvacated pending resolution of dispositive motions. (10/13/2021 Oral Order)\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nThe operative scheduling order in this case provides that \u201c[a]mendment of the\nInfringement Contentions or the Invalidity Contentions may be made only by order of the Court\nupon a timely showing of good cause.\u201d (D.I. 69 at 7); see British Telecommce\u2019ns PLC v.\nIAC/InterActiveCorp, C.A. No. 18-366-WCB, 2020 WL 3047989, at *2 (D. Del. June 8, 2020).\n\nGood cause requires a showing of diligence both in discovering that amendment was necessary\nand in moving to amend after the discovery. See O2 Micro Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Monolithic Power Sys.,\nInc., 467 F.3d 1355, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2006). \u201cNon-exhaustive examples of circumstances that\nmay ... support a finding of good cause include (a) a recent discovery of material prior art\ndespite earlier diligent search and (b) recent discovery of nonpublic information about the\nAccused Instrumentality which was not discovered, despite diligent efforts, before the service of\nthe Infringement Contentions.\u201d (D.I. 69 at \u00a7 7)\nIv. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Motion to Amend Infringement Contentions\n\n1. Diligence\n\nIn support of its motion for leave to amend, Volterra contends that it was diligent both in\nseeking information regarding the NVIDIA Power Solution product and in seeking leave to\namend its infringement contentions. (D.I. 165 at 7-12) Volterra provides a comprehensive\ntimeline in its brief outlining its efforts to identify and obtain discovery on products substantially\nsimilar to the 48V-1V. (/d at 8-10) Volterra further explains that it promptly moved to amend\nits infringement contentions only two weeks after Monolithic produced technical documents\nestablishing that the NVIDIA Power Solution product was substantially similar to the 48V-1V.\n(Id. at 10-12)\n\nIn response, Monolithic alleges that Volterra\u2019s proposed amendment is untimely for three\nreasons: (1) Volterra has known of the NVIDIA Power Solution product since early 2017; (2)\na\nHEE (3) Monolithic disclosed the NVIDIA Power Solution product to Volterra in\n\nSeptember 2020. (D.I. 177 at 11-15)\nThe record before the court establishes that Volterra exercised diligence in seeking\ndiscovery on the NVIDIA Power Solution and in promptly amending its infringement\ncontentions upon the discovery of nonpublic information about the NVIDIA Power Solution.\nSince September 2020, Volterra served discovery requests seeking to establish the identity of\nadditional accused products and obtain evidence on products substantially similar to the accused\n48V-1V. (D.I. 166, Ex. C at 1, 4; Exs. H & I) Nonetheless, Monolithic did not promptly\nidentify the NVIDIA Power Solution in response to Volterra\u2019s requests,\u2019 and Monolithic\u2019s\nproduction of technical documents and communications regarding the NVIDIA Power Solution\ndid not materialize until April and May 2021. (D.I. 166, Ex. D at 6; Exs. M-O) The production\nof these documents represents the kind of \u201crecent discovery of nonpublic information about the\nAccused Instrumentality which was not discovered, despite diligent efforts, before the service of\nthe Infringement Contentions\u201d that is contemplated by the scheduling order. (D.I. 69 at { 7)\nVolterra did not delay in seeking leave to amend its infringement contentions within weeks of\nreceiving the documents. (D.I. 166, Ex. R)\n\nMonolithic suggests that a document produced on October 30, 2020 provided Volterra\nwith sufficient technical information to amend its contentions to include the NVIDIA Power\n\nSolution. (D.I. 177 at 16-17) This product specification of a i power\n\ninductor contains a single footnote suggesting that a DC current controlling surface temperature\n\nin the product \u2018s iE (DI. 178, Ex. J at MPS_DE-\n\n00000917) Although the document put Volterra on notice that Monolithic developed a product\n\n4 Without citing supporting documentation, Monolithic alleges that it expressly identified the\nNVIDIA Power Solution to Volterra in a September 21, 2020 meet and confer. (D.I. 177 at 7,\n15-17) Despite this representation, Monolithic did not include the NVIDIA Power Solution in its\ninterrogatory responses served on October 14, 2020, which sought the identification of products\nsubstantially similar to the 48V-1V. (D.I. 166, Ex. D at 5-6)\n\n6\nwith NVIDIA using coupled inductors, (D.I. 178, Ex. B at 1), it did not provide the level of\ntechnical detail necessary for Volterra to satisfy its obligations under the scheduling order, which\nrequires infringement contentions to be accompanied by \u201c[a] chart identifying specifically where\nand how each limitation of each asserted claim is found within each Accused Instrumentality,\u201d\n(D.I. 69 at 7 3(c)). Monolithic attempts to equate Volterra\u2019s knowledge of the existence of the\nNVIDIA Power Solution with Volterra\u2019s ability to provide detailed infringement contentions\nregarding the product, but the record shows that Volterra relied on the production from April and\nMay 2021 to achieve the requisite level of technical detail in its contentions as demanded by\nMonolithic and described in the scheduling order. (D.L. 177 at 15-17 (challenging the lack of\ndetail in Volterra\u2019s initial infringement contentions); D.I. 178, Ex. R (string citing Bates ranges\nfrom the April-May 2021 productions)). The same is true of Monolithic\u2019s arguments based on\n> (D1. 177 at 12-14)\n\nMonolithic also contends that Volterra lacked diligence because it knew of the NVIDIA\nPower Solution as early as 2017, prior to the filing of the lawsuit. (D.I. 177 at 11) In support of\nthis allegation, Monolithic cites to Maxim\u2019s December 2017 response to NVIDIA\u2019s request for\ninformation seeking a power solution proposal from Maxim including a coupled inductor. (/d.;\nsee D.I. 178, Ex. C at NVIDIA_0000113) But Monolithic fails to explain how Maxim\u2019s 2017\ncoupled inductor proposal, which was rejected by NVIDIA, can form the technical basis of\nVolterra\u2019s infringement contentions regarding Monolithic\u2019s NVIDIA Power Solution, which has\n\na Monolithic controller and a coupled inductor made by a third-party manufacturer.\n\n> Monolithic\u2019s arguments regarding S are largely directed to case\ndispositive issues beyond the scope of the pending motion. (D.I. 177 at 13-14) The court\ndeclines to and makes no findings as to\nVolterra\u2019s exercise of diligence both in discovering the need for an amendment and in\nmoving to amend its infringement contentions supports a finding of good cause in this case. See\nBritish Telecommc\u2019ns, 2020 WL 30479839, at *2.\n\n2. Prejudice\n\nVolterra\u2019s proposed amendment of its infringement contentions would not result in the\nexpenditure of significant additional resources, nor is it likely to significantly delay resolution of\nthe case because briefing on case dispositive motions is not yet complete and the trial date was\nvacated. The record establishes that Monolithic has been on notice that the NVIDIA Power\nSolution was an accused product since at least September 2020. During the September 10, 2020\nscheduling conference, counsel for Monolithic suggested that the case be limited to the 48V-1V\nand substantially similar products with a different name. (D.I. 166, Ex. Q at 14:11-18)\nConsistent with this discussion, Volterra\u2019s SAC accused products \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the\n48V-1V of infringement. (D.I. 71 at 18) Monolithic admits that it disclosed the existence of\nthe NVIDIA Power Solution and confirmed its new controllers were used in the NVIDIA Power\nSolution during a September 21, 2020 meet and confer. (D.J. 177 at 7, 15) And Monolithic\u2019s\nDecember 2020 letter to Volterra identified the NVIDIA Power Solution as a version of the 48V-\n1V. (DI. 166, Ex. A)\n\nMonolithic alleges that Volterra\u2019s delay deprives Monolithic of presenting claim\nconstruction issues that depend on Volterra\u2019s new infringement theories. (D.I. 177 at 17) But\nMonolithic does not describe how inclusion of the NVIDIA Power Solution would have changed\nthe arguments it would have raised on claim construction, nor does it explain how infringement\nby the \u201csubstantially similar\u201d NVIDIA Power Solution amounts to a new theory of infringement.\n\nThe short shrift given to the prejudice factor in Monolithic\u2019s briefing confirms that \u201cthe degree\nof potential prejudice is not so great as to make prejudice a dispositive factor in deciding the\nmotion.\u201d British Telecomme\u2019ns, 2020 WL 3047989, at *4.\n\nGood cause exists to allow Volterra\u2019s proposed amended infringement contentions\nbecause Volterra has demonstrated diligence and allegations of undue prejudice are not\nsupported by the record. For these reasons, Volterra\u2019s motion to amend its infringement\ncontentions is granted.\n\nB. Motion for Leave to File Sur-Reply\n\nMonolithic\u2019s motion for leave to file a sur-reply brief is denied. Local Rule 7.1.2(b)\nprovides that parties may submit additional papers after the completion of briefing only with\ncourt approval, and courts in this district generally disfavor sur-replies. See D. Del. LR 7.1.2(b);\nEMC Corp. v. Pure Storage, Inc., 154 F. Supp. 3d 81, 103 (D. Del. 2016). Accordingly, leave to\nfile a sur-reply is granted only if it is necessary to respond to new evidence, facts, or arguments\nraised for the first time in the reply brief. Novartis AG v. Actavis, Inc., 243 F. Supp. 3d 534, 540\n(D. Del. 2017) (citing St. Clair Intellectual Prop. Consultants, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 291\nF.R.D. 75, 80 (D. Del. 2013)).\n\nHere, Volterra\u2019s arguments in reply \u201cinvolve content that is directly responsive to\narguments made in [Monolithic\u2019s] answering brief.\u201d Execware, LLC v. BJ's Wholesale Club,\nIne. et al., C.A. No. 14-233-LPS-CIB et al., 2015 WL 4275314, at *2 n.3 (D. Del. July 15,\n2015), reversed in part on other grounds by 2015 WL 5734434 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2015)).\nSpecifically, Monolithic\u2019s answering brief addresses NVIDIA\u2019s request for information and\nMaxim\u2019 s i, ang it attaches the associated documents as exhibits to\nthe brief. (D.I. 177 at 11-14; D.I. 178, Exs. C, D) Volterra was within its rights to respond to\n\nthese arguments in its reply brief. See Siemens Med. Sols. USA, Inc. v. Humedica, Inc., C.A. No.\n14-880-LPS-CJB, 2015 WL 1738186, at *1 n.1 (D. Del. Apr. 8, 2015) (denying motion for leave\nto file sur-reply where \u201ccomplained-of material was responsive to theories and arguments raised\nin [defendant\u2019s] answering brief\u2019); Kabbaj v. Simpson, C.A. No. 12-1322-RGA-MPT, 2013 WL\n867751, at *6 (D. Del. Mar. 7, 2013) (\u201cGenerally, courts grant leave for sur-reply briefing when\na party raises new arguments in its reply brief . . . [that] are beyond responding to the answering\nbrief.\u201d). Consequently, Monolithic\u2019s motion for leave to file a sur-reply brief is denied.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Volterra\u2019s motion for leave to serve amended infringement\ncontentions is GRANTED (D.I. 164), Monolithic\u2019s motion for leave to file a sur-reply brief is\nDENIED (D.I. 190), and Monolithic\u2019s motion for leave to serve amended invalidity contentions\nis GRANTED (D.I. 239). An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nGiven that the court has relied upon material that technically remains under seal, the\ncourt is releasing this Memorandum Opinion under seal, pending review by the parties. In the\nunlikely event that the parties believe that certain material in this Memorandum Opinion should\nbe redacted, the parties shall jointly submit a proposed redacted version by no later than\nDecember 6, 2021, for review by the court, along with a motion supported by a declaration that\nincludes a clear, factually detailed explanation as to why disclosure of any proposed redacted\nmaterial would \u201cwork a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure.\u201d See In\nre Avandia Mktg., Sales Practices & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019)\n(quoting Miller v. Ind. Hosp., 16 F.3d 549, 551 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). If the parties do not file a proposed redacted version and corresponding motion, or if\nthe court determines the motion lacks a meritorious basis, the documents will be unsealed within\n\nthirty (30) days of the date the Memorandum Opinion issued.\n\n10\nThis Memorandum Opinion is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed.
