Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore me is the issue of claim construction of multiple terms in U.S. Patent No. 9,603,860 \n(the \u201c\u2019860 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 10,179,140 (the \u201c \u2019140 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 10,987,364 \n(the \u201c\u2019364 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 11,123,299 (the \u201c \u2019299 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 11,291,632 \n(the \u201c\u2019632 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 11,291,633 (the \u201c \u2019633 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 11,351,122 \n(the \u201c\u2019122 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 11,413,249 (the \u201c \u2019249 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 11,439,598 \n(the \u201c\u2019598 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 11,452,695 (the \u201c \u2019695 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 11,478,487 \n(the \u201c\u2019487 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No.11,491,113 (the \u201c \u2019113 patent\u201d), and U.S. Patent No. 11,504,334 \n(the \u201c\u2019334 patent\u201d) (the \u201cAsserted Patents\u201d).  The parties submitted a Joint Claim Construction \nBrief (D.I. 82) and Appendix (D.I. 83; D.I. 84; D.I. 85), and I hea rd oral argument on February 16, \n2023 (D.I. 96). The parties submitted additional letters . (D.I. 102; D.I. 105; D.I. 106).  \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs filed their first patent application , U.S. Patent Application No. 13/171,410 (the \n\u201c\u2019410 Application\u201d ), in 2011. The \u2019410 Application issued as U.S. Patent No. 10,849,857 and is \nnot asserted in this case. (D.I. 82 at 26). The \u2019860 and \u2019140 Patents are continuations -in-part of the \n\u2019410 Application. (D.I. 82 at 28 n.4). The other Asserted Patents are continuations of the \u2019410 \nApplication. ( Markman Hearing Tr. 14:21- 25).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cIt is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c\u2018[T]here is no magic formula or \ncatechism for conducting claim construction.\u2019  Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate \nweight to appropriate sources \u2018in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\u2019\u201d  2 \n SoftView LLC v. Apple Inc., 2013 WL 4758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (alteration in original) \n(quoting Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1324). When construing patent claims, a court considers the literal \nlanguage of the claim, the patent specification, and the prosecution history.  Markman v. Westview \nInstruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 977\u201380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 (1996). Of \nthese sources, \u201cthe specification is always highly r elevant to the claim construction analysis.  \nUsually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  Phillips , \n415 F.3d at 1315 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinar y and customary meaning. . . . \n[Which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.\u201d  Id. at \n1312\u201313 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term \nis its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id. at 1321 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \u201cIn some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by a person \nof skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words.\u201d  Id. at 1314. \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evidence \u2014the patent claims, the specification, \nand the prosecution history\u2014the court\u2019s construction is a determination of law. See Teva Pharms. \nUSA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. , 574 U.S. 318, 331 (2015). The court may also make factual findings \nbased upon consideration of extrinsic evidence, which \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317\u201319 (quoting Markman, 52 F.3d at 980). Extrinsic evidence \nmay assist the court in understanding the underlying technology, the meaning of terms to one 3 \n skilled in the art, and how the invention works. Id. Extrinsic evidence, however, is less reliable \nand less useful in claim construction than the patent and its prosecution history. Id . \nIII. CONSTRUCTION OF AGREED- UPON TERMS  \nI adopt the following agreed- upon constructions:  \nClaim Term  Claims1 Construction  \n\u201cbleeding events\u201d  \u2019180 Patent claims 1 -40; \n\u2019140 Patent claims 1 -39. \u201cvaginal bleeding and spotting that occurs \nduring a woman\u2019s treatment cycle\u201d  \n\u201ca [female2] patient\u201d / \n\u201cthe patient\u201d   \u2019180 Patent claims 1 -40; \n\u2019140 Patent claims 1 -39; \n\u2019632 Patent claims 20;  \n\u2019633 Patent claims 20;  \n\u2019249 Patent claims 1 -10; \n\u2019598 Patent claims 1 -27; \n\u2019695 Patent claims 1 -28; \n\u2019487 Patent claims 1 -30; \n\u2019113 Patent claims 1 -30; \n\u2019334 Patent claims 1 -30. \u201cone or more [female] patients\u201d (D.I. 96)  \n \nIV. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERM S \nPlaintiffs are asserting the following claims: \u2019860 Patent claims 1 -40; \u2019140 Patent claims \n1-39; \u2019364 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12- 14, 17, 20; \u2019299 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12- 14, 17, 20; \u2019632 \nPatent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21; \u2019633 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21; \u2019122 P atent \nclaims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15, 18 -26, 29; \u2019249 P atent claims 1 -5, 7, 8, 10; \u2019598 Patent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, \n15, 18- 27; \u2019695 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20- 28; \u2019487 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15- 17, 19-\n30; \u2019113 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 13- 30; \u2019334 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15- 17, 19- 30. (D.I. 104 at \n2). The following claims are representative for claim construction purposes.  \n \n1 The parties did not identify which claims contained which  terms. These are the claims I \nidentified to contain  the terms. Not all claims are asserted.  (D.I. 104 at 2).  If there are any \nasserted claims that I failed to identify, these agreed -upon constructions apply to them too . \n \n2 \u201cA female patient\u201d only appears in the \u2019249 Patent.  4 \n  \u2019860 Patent  \n1. A method of providing contraception in a patient having a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more \nand bleeding events, the method comprising:  \nadministering a pharmaceutical composition comprising 2.5 mg to 5.5 mg crystalline of \ndrospirenone and one or more pharmaceutically- acceptable excipients to a p atient \nhaving a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more for an initial treatment cycle and for subsequent \nconsecutive treatment cycles, the pharmaceutical composition being administered \ndaily for at least a portion of the initial and subsequent consecutive treatment \ncycles ;  \nwherein the administering results in a limited number of days of bleeding events per \ntreatment cycle in at least one of the subsequent consecutive treatment cycles.  \n 15. The method of claim 12, wherein the weight loss results in a reduction in the patient\u2019 s \nBMI of about  1% to about  20%. \n (\u2019860 P atent , col. 64: 14-27; 65:9- 11 (disputed terms  italicized  and bolded)).   \n\u2019695 Patent  \n1. A pharmaceutical composition comprising:  \nmicronized 6\u03b2,7\u03b2:15\u03b2,16\u03b2 -Dimethylene -3-oxo-17\u03b1-pregn -4-ene-21,17-  carbolactone, \nwherein the 6\u03b2,7\u03b2:15\u03b2,16\u03b2 -Dimethylene -3-oxo-17\u03b1-pregn -4- ene- 21,17-\ncarbolactone is present in an amount ranging from 3 milligrams (mg) to 4.5 mg;  \nand  \none or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients,  \nwherein the pharmaceutical composition does not comprise estrogen; and  \nwherein the pharmaceutical composition is formulated such that :  \n(1) when orally administered to a patient under fasting conditions, the pharmaceutical \ncomposition provides a pharmacokinetic profile for the 6\u03b2,7\u03b2:15\u03b2,16\u03b2 -Dim-\nethylene- 3-oxo-17\u03b1-pregn -4-ene-21,17- carbolactone  comprising:  \n(i) a mean T\nmax ranging from 2.2 hours to 6 hours; and  \n(ii) a mean C max of less than 30 ng/ml; and  \n(2) no more than 50% of the 6\u03b2,7\u03b2:15\u03b2,16\u03b2 -Dimethylene -3-oxo-17\u03b1-pregn4 -ene-21,17 -\ncarbolactone initially present in the pharmaceutical composition is dissolved within 30 minutes if subjecte d to an in vitro dissolution test according to the USP \nXXIII Paddle Method.  \n \n(\u2019695 P atent , col. 61: 27-51 (disputed terms italicized  and bolded )). \n Before  the Markman hearing, I proposed tentative constructions for the disputed terms. \n(D.I. 100). In respons e to my tentative constructions, the parties \u201cagreed that they will rest on their \nrespective papers for Term B ( \u2018causes \u2019 / \u2018results in \u2019), Term E (\u2018 non-micronized \u2019 / \u2018micronized \u2019), 5 \n and Term F (the particle size terms)\u201d and did not argue these terms at the hearing. (D.I. 104 at 1). \nMy tentative constructions for those three terms are adopted. (Markman Hearing Tr. 96:22- 97:1). \nI now turn to the remaining disputed terms.  \n1. \u201cis formulated  such that\u201d / \u201cis formulated to provide\u201d / \u201cprovides a pharmokinetic \nprofile for the drospirenone\u201d (\u2019860 P atent claim s 37-39; \u2019140 P atent claim s 36-38;  \n\u2019364 Patent claims 1 -7, 10, 12- 14, 17, 20; \u2019299 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12- 14, 17, 20; \n\u2019632 Patent claim s 1-7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21; \u2019633 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15, 18, \n20, 21; \u2019122 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15, 18- 26, 29; \u2019249 P atent claims 1 -5, 7, 8, \n10; \u2019598 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15, 18- 27; \u2019695 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15, 18, \n20\u201328; \u2019487 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15- 17, 19- 30; \u2019113 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 13-\n30; \u2019334 P atent claims 1 -7, 10, 12, 15- 17, 19- 30).  \n \na. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction: plain  and ordinary meaning . \nb. Defendants \u2019 proposed construction: \u201c the drospirenone consists of particles with a \nd50 ranging between 10 micrometers and 60 micrometers \u201d \nc. Court\u2019s construction: plain and ordinary meaning. \nThe parties dispute whether there is a particle size limitation  in this term. (D.I. 82 at 20).  \nPlaintiffs argue that importing such a limitation is unsupported by the claim language as \nsome claims using this term recite a particle size limitation while others do not. ( Id. (citing \u2019860 \nPatent, cl. 27- 28, 30) ). Plaintiffs also cite to the specification for support tha t the particle size is \nspecified for some embodiments, but not the invention generally . (D.I. 82 at 20- 21 (citing \u2019860 \nPatent, col. 4:15- 23, 4:46 -57, 7:31- 63)). Plaintiffs contend that nothing in the prosecution history \nrises to clear and unmistakable disclaime r. Plaintiffs argue that the statements in the prosecution \nhistory that Defendants cite to  would improperly limit the scope of the term in the \u2019860, \u2019140, and \n\u2019281 Patents because the statements were made after th ose patents  had issued. (D.I. 82 at 21).  \nDefendants argue that the particle size limitation is properly incorporated into the term \nbecause the patentee clearly and unmistakably disavowed particle sizes outside of this range. ( Id. \nat 21-22). Defendants rely on statements made by the patentee  (D.I. 84-21, Ex. 34 at JA0870) , and \na declaration by Dr. Sandra Blatnik in the response to  rejections by the patent examiner (D.I. 84-6 \n 22, Ex. 35 at JA0873- 77), to argue that the particle size was critical to the invention and thus \nparticle sizes outside the rang e of d 50 between 10  \u00b5m to 60 \u00b5m were disavowed. (D.I. 82 at 23).  \nThe statements Defendants cite to may be relevant to claim construction notwithstanding \nthe fact they were made after three patents had already issued. See Microsoft Corp. v. Multi -Tech \nSys., Inc., 357 F.3d 1340, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The se statements in the prosecution history, \nhowever, do not rise to the level of clear and unmistakable disclaimer. \u201cWhen the purported \ndisclaimers are directed to specific claim terms that have been omitted or materially altered in subsequent applications (rather than to the invention itself), those disclaimers do not apply.\u201d Saunders Grp., Inc. v. Comfortrac, Inc., 492 F.3d 1326, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The statements \nDefendants cite to in the  prosecution history are directed to claims that explicitly recite a particle \nsize limitation. ( See, e.g., D.I. 84- 20, Ex. 33 at JA0843, JA08 61 (disagreeing with rejection but \namending claims to add particle size range limitation) ; D.I. 84- 22, Ex. 35 at JA0873- 74 (discussing \nclaims that recited a particle size limitation) ). Because th ose statements were not made in \nconnection with the claim language at issue here , or the scope of the invention generally, I find \nthey do not rise to the level of prosecution disclaimer. See Sanofi v. Watson Lab\u2019ys Inc., 875 F.3d 636, 650 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  \nTherefore, I adopt Plaintiffs \u2019 proposed construction of \u201cplain and ordinary meaning.\u201d  I \nreject Defendants\u2019 proposed limitations.  \n2. \u201ccrystalline drospirenone\u201d / \u201ccrystalline of drospirenone\u201d  (\u2019860 patent claims 1-\n40; \u2019140 patent claims 1- 39) \na. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction: plain and meaning , which is \u201cdrospirenone in \ncrystalline form\u201d  \nb. Defendants \u2019 proposed construction: \u201c drospirenone in which over 50% as \nmeasured by weight is in crystallized form \u201d \nc. Court\u2019s construction: plain and ordinary mea ning. 7 \n The dispute with respect to this term is whether the term specifies a threshold for the  \npercentage of the drospirenone by weight that must be in crystalline form.  \nPlaintiffs argue there is nothing in the claims, specification, or prosecution history that \nrequires crystalline drospirenone to be over 50% by weight in crystalline form. (D.I. 82 at 28-29). \nPlaintiffs contend that statements in the prosecution history that  Defendants cite to  were to \ndistinguish prior art that \u201ctaught the complete exclusion of crystalline forms of drospirenone\u201d and that the \u201cpercentage of drospirenone was not discussed.\u201d ( Id.).  \nDefendants present two arguments for their proposed construction. First, Defendants argue \nthat Plaintiffs disclaimed crystalline drospirenone where the crystalline form was less than 50% by weight through prosecution history disclaimer. (Id. at 30). Defendants cite statements made in \nthe \u2019410 Application where Plaintiffs  amended claim language to include the phrase \u201cthe dosage \nform or unit consists essentially of crystalline drospirenone\u201d after Plaintiffs \u201cwere cautioned of the phrase \u2018crystalline form\u2019 since said term encompasses any degree of crystallinity.\u201d ( Id. at 30 \n(quoting D.I. 84- 24, Ex. 37 at JA0911)). Defendants contend that Plaintiffs \u2019 proposed construction \nwould cover embodiments with any degree of crystallinity, which Plaintiffs disclaimed during prosecution. (D.I. 82  at 30 ). Second, Defendants argue that \u201cthere is no disclosure  in the \nspecification of a formulation containing crystallized drospirenone where the percentage falls below 50%.\u201d ( Id. at 31).  \nI agree with Plaintiffs  that importing a limitation for  the percentage of drospirenone that is \nin crystallin e form is improper. First, the statements in the \u2019410 Application pertain to amended \nclaims that recite \u201c wherein the progestogen- only contraceptive consists essentially of at least about \n2 mg of crystalline  drospirenone.\u201d ( See, e.g. , D.I. 84- 25, Ex. 38 at JA0914). That claim language \nis not present in the \u2019860 or \u2019140 Patents  and the statements in the prosecution history are directed 8 \n to that claim language, not the invention generally. See Sanofi , 875 F.3d at 650. T he statements \nand amendments do not rise to the level of clear and unmistakable disclaimer.  \nSecond, the specification describes an \u201cessentially crystallized form\u201d as being preferred or \nas \u201cone embodiment ,\u201d not an attribute of the invention generally. (\u2019860 Patent, col. 37:58- 61; \u2019140 \nPatent, col. 38:2- 5). Including this limitation in the construction would improperly import a \nlimitation from the specification  into the claim. See Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1323 ( Fed. Cir. 2005).  \nTherefore, I adopt Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed construction of \u201cplain and ordinary meaning.\u201d  I \nreject Defendants\u2019 proposed limitations.   \n3. \u201cabout \u201d (\u2019860 patent claims 2- 11, 13- 16, 20- 21, 25- 31, 37- 39; \u2019140 patent claims \n2-11, 13- 16, 20- 21, 25- 31, 36- 38; \u2019364 patent claim 20; \u2019299 patent claim 20; \u2019632 \npatent claim 18; \u2019633 patent claim 18; \u2019122 patent claims 1- 7, 10, 12, 15, 18\u201326, \n29; \u2019598 patent claims 1- 7, 10, 12, 15, 18\u201327; \u2019695 patent claim 18)  \na. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction: plain m eaning (\u201c approximately\u201d)  \nb. Defendants\u2019 proposed construction: indefinite  \nc. Court\u2019s construction: indefinite  \nDefendants argue that the patentees  acted as their own lexicographer and defined \u201cabout\u201d \nin such a way that the term is indefinite. The Defendants cite to the specification : \nAs used herein, the term \u201cabout\u201d before a \u201cspecific value\u201d defines a range from \n\u201cthe specific value minus at least 10% of the specific value\u201d to \u201cthe specific value plus at least 10% of the specific value.\u201d For example, \u201cabout 50\u201d def ines a range \nfrom 45 or less to 55 or more. In addition, it may define a range where \u201cthe specific value minus at least 20% of the specific value\u201d to \u201cthe specific value plus at least 20% of the specific value.\u201d Further, it may define a range where \u201cthe sp ecific value \nminus at least 30% of the specific value\u201d to \u201cthe specific value plus at least 30% of the specific value\u201d and so on.  \n \n(\u2019860 Patent , col. 20:32-42). Defendants argue that the plain and ordinary meaning for \u201cabout\u201d \nshould not apply because the p atentees  \u201cprovided (and meant to provide) an explicit definition of \n\u2018about\u2019 in the specification.\u201d (D.I. 82 at 56). Defendants contend the claim is indefinite because 9 \n \u201cthe specification provides no guidance concerning which types of specific measurements s hould \nbe subjected to a 10% deviation, or a 20% deviation, or 30%, or even more.\u201d ( Id.).  \n Plaintiffs argue that this part of the specification does not constitute lexicography and, \ntherefore, the plain and ordinary meaning should apply. (D.I. 102 at 1). Plaintiffs contend that this \npart of the specification is just exemplary language and guidance consistent with the idea that \u201cthe boundaries of \u2018about\u2019 depend on context.\u201d ( Id. at 1-2). Plaintiffs cite to the use of \u201cmay\u201d and \nexamples in the paragraph to support their argument that \u201c[a] person of ordinary skill would not \nread the excerpt as mandating one definition but would understand \u2018about\u2019 has different meanings depending on the value described.\u201d ( Id. at 2). Plaintiffs also argue that even if this is lexicography, \nthe specification is consistent with the construction of \u201capproximate.\u201d (D.I. 102 at 3).  \n\u201cWhere a patentee has not acted as his own lexicographer in redefining the word \u2018about,\u2019 \ncourts have construed \u2018about\u2019 to mean \u2018approximately.\u2019\u201d Silvergate Pharms. Inc.  v. Bionpharma \nInc., 2018 WL 1610513, at *4 (D. Del. Apr. 3, 2018) . I find, however, that Plaintiffs have acted \nas their own lexicographer to redefine \u201cabout.\u201d First, the term \u201cabout\u201d \u201cis set off by quotation \nmarks \u2014often a strong indication that what follows is a definition.\u201d Sinorgchem Co., Shandong v.  \nInt'l Trade Comm'n , 511 F.3d 1132, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Second, \u201c[t]he \u2018as used herein \u2019 \nleading into the definition, . . ., indicates that the patentee became [its] own lexicographer.\u201d Jazz \nPharms., Inc.  v. Roxane Lab'ys,  Inc., 2012 WL 4103880, at *4 (D.N.J. Sept. 14, 2012). I find \nthese indicators are sufficient \u201cto put one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the inventor intended to redefine the claim term.\u201d  Merck & Co. v.  Teva  Pharms. USA,  Inc., 395 F.3d 1364, \n1370 (Fed. Cir. 2005). \n 10 \n I disagree with Plaintiffs tha t the language here is consistent with the ordinary meaning of \n\u201cabout\u201d (i.e., approximately). The specification recites \u201c the term \u2018about\u2019 before a \u2018 specific value \u2019 \ndefines a range from \u2018 the specific value minus at least 10% of the specific value\u2019 to \u2018 the s pecific \nvalue plus at least 10% of the specific value. \u2019\u201d (\u2019860 Patent, col. 20:32- 35). This defined range is \nboundless. The next sentence of the specification confirms this as it defines \u201cabout 50\u201d to be \u201ca \nrange from 45 or less to 55 or more.\u201d ( Id. at 35 -36).  Instead of defining \u201cabout\u201d to be something \nakin to \u201capproximately\u201d (e.g., a value a little below or little above a specific value), the specification defines \u201cabout\u201d before a \u201cspecific value\u201d to cover an unbounded range. \nTurning to the content of the specification, I find \u201cabout\u201d is indefinite. \u201c[A] patent is invalid \nfor indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification delineating the patent, and the \nprosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope \nof the invention.\u201d Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig  Instruments, Inc., 572 U.S. 898, 901 (2014) . As \ndiscussed, \u201cabout\u201d before a specific value would cover an unbounded range \u2013 all values would be covered . Therefore, a person of ordinary skill in the art would not be reasonably certain what the \nscope of the claims are because \u201cabout\u201d a specific value would cover  any value despite the claims \nreciting a specific value.   \nThe rest of the definition is consistent with claiming unbounded ranges.  The remainder of \nthe paragraph in the specification says \u201cabout\u201d can define a range of plus or minus a 10% deviation,  \nor a 20% deviation, or a 30% deviation, \u201cand so on.\u201d ( See \u2019860 P atent , col. 20:42).  Deviations \nexceeding 30% are clearly contemplated by the \u201cand so on\u201d language. Therefore, there is no definitive upper bound on the size of the deviation that is encompassed by \u201cabout \u201d a specific value. \nA person of ordinary skill would not be informed as to the scope of \u201cabout \u201d a specific value \nbecause a deviation of any size, no matter how large, could fall within the scope of the claim.  11 \n The patentees took a perfectly good and easily understood word and defined it into \nindefiniteness.    \nV. CONCLUSION \nWithin five days the parties shall submit a proposed order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion. \n "}
