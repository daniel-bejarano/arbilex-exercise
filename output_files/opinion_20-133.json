Potere, SKIERMONT DERBY LLP \nAttorneys for Defendants HEC Pharm Co., Ltd. and HEC Pharm USA Inc. \nApril (o , 2023 \nWilmington, Delaware \nGREGORYB. WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE In this Hatch-Waxman Act action filed by Plaintiff Novartis Phannaceuticals Corporation \n(''Novartis\") against Defendants HEC Phann Co., Ltd. and HEC Phann USA Inc. (together, \n\"HEC\"), Novartis alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,543,179 (\"the '179 patent\"). The \n'179 patent relates to the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (\"RRMS\"). Before \nthe Court is the issue of claim construction of multiple terms in this patent. The Court has \nconsidered the parties' joint claim construction brief, related submissions, and argument at the \nclaim construction hearing (the \"Hearing\"). See D.I. 152, 195, 196, 197, 220. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Claim Construction \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v. \nSumitomo Elec. US.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"A claim in a patent provides \nthe metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling the protected invention \"). \"[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for \nconducting claim construction.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the \nappropriate weight to appropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent \nlaw.\" Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question oflaw, although \nsubsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct. \n831,837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc., 517 U.S. 370,372 (1996)). \n\"The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as \nunderstood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and \nprosecution history.\" Thorner v. Sony Comput. Ent. Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. \n2 2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art \"is deemed to \nread the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term \nappears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at \nat 1313. \n\"When construing claim terms, the court first looks to, and primarily rely on, the intrinsic \nevidence, including the claims themselves , the specification , and the prosecution history of the \npatent, which is usually dispositive. \" Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d \n1271, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \"Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted , \ncan ... be valuable\" in discerning the meaning of a disputed claim term because \"claim terms are \nnormally used consistently throughout the patent,\" and so, \"the usage of a term in one claim can \noften illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In \naddition,\"[ d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide[.]\" Id. For example, ''the presence \nof a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation \nin question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id. at 1314-15. \nIn addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification , which \"is always highly \nrelevant to the claim construction analysis ... [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a \ndisputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptr onic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is \nalso possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the \npatentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases , the inventor's \nlexicography governs.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \"Even when the specification describes only \na single embodiment , [however ,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the \npatentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of \nmanifest exclusion or restriction. \" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 \n3 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) ( quoting Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., \n358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification \"is not a substitute for, nor can it be \nused to rewrite, the chosen claim language .\" SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d \n870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \nThe Court \"should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence .\" \nMarkman, 52 F.3d at 980. The prosecution history \"can often inform the meaning of the claim \nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor \nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution[.]\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. \nIn some cases, the Court \"will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \"consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony , dictionaries , and learned treatises. \" Markman , 52 F.3d \nat 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \"less significant than the intrinsic \nrecord in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language. \" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nII. AGREED-UPON TERMS \nThe parties agreed upon the construction of the following terms: \nI', Claim Term Agreed-Upon Construction \n\"testing said patient for a history of infection Plain and ordinary meaning: Checking said \ncaused by varicella zoster virus\" patient for a history or evidence of prior \n(claim 1) infection or vaccination \n\"thereby limiting the risk of infection caused Plain and ordinary meaning: This phrase is a \nby varicella zoster virus.\" non-limiting statement of intended results \n(claim 1) from the claimed method. \n4 The Court will adopt these agreed-upon constructions . \nIII. DISPUTED TERMS \nA. Preamble: \"A method for treating relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in a \npatient in need thereof' \nClaim Term Plaintiff's Defendants' The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \nPreamble: \"A \nmethod for treating \nrelapsing remitting The preamble is a Limiting statement of The preamble is a \nmultiple sclerosis in limiting statement of purpose that does not limiting statement of \na patient in need purpose. require efficacy. purpose. \nthereof,\" \n(claim 1) \nThe parties agree that the preamble is a limiting statement of purpose and does not require \nactual efficacy. D.I. 197 at 32-33, Tr. 10:4-5. Novartis explains that the preamble , in describing \nthe claimed invention 's purpose, contemplates an \"efficacious purpose.\" Tr. 10:6-8; 14-16 (\"A \nlimiting statement of purpose that does require a belief in efficacy, but does not require an \nefficacious result\"). HEC argues that Novartis' \"efficacious purpose\" disguises an additional \nlimitation requiring \"a mental state or intent of efficacy.\" Tr. 18:4-6. \nClaim 1 of the '179 patent recites: \n1. A method for treating relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in a \npatient in need thereof, the method comprising: \n(a) identifying a patient at risk of contracting infection caused \nby varicella zoster virus by testing said patient for a history of \ninfection caused by varicella zoster virus, \n(b) vaccinating the patient at risk of contracting infection \ncaused by varicella zoster virus, and \n( c) administering orally fingolimod or a pharmaceutically \nacceptable salt thereof to said patient at a daily dosage of 0.5 \nmg, thereby limiting the risk of infection caused by varicella \nzoster virus. \n5 '197 patent at cl. 1. The language of the preamble (\"A method for treating relapsing remitting \nmultiple sclerosis in a patient in need thereof') contemplates an efficacious purpose. Specifically, \n\"treating\" a patient \"in need thereof' suggests that the purpose of the claimed method is \ntherapeutically effective treatments rather than simply administering fingolimod without intending \nefficacy. \nThe efficacious purpose set forth in the claims is mirrored in the intrinsic record. The \nspecification notes that that \"there is a significant unmet need for effective new therapies in MS, \nwhich limit or reduce the possible adverse events or side effects.\" '179 patent at 1:31-34. The \ninventors discovered \"a dosing regimen and a method of controlling, reducing, or abolishing the \npossible adverse events associated with treating a patient suffering from an inflammatory or \nautoimmune disease or disorder with a S 1 P receptor modulator or agonist, comprising \nadministering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of said S 1 P receptor modulator or \nagonist[.]\" Id. at 8:1-7; see also id. at Abstract; id. at 1:1-3:35, id. at 7:33-8:47, id. at 10:47---63. \nDuring prosecution, the inventors contemplated efficacy, distinguishing a prior art reference by \nexplaining it does not disclose that \"0.5 mg is effective in treating multiple sclerosis.\" D.I. 196-1 \nat Appxl 759; see also id. at Appxl 760; id. at Appxl 606 at ,r 18. \nHEC contends that its proposed construction excluding efficacy provides \"scope-clarifying \nlanguage\" consistent with Judge Stark's construction of U.S. Patent No. 9,187,405 (\"the '405 \npatent\") in Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation v. Accord Healthcare Inc., C.A. No. 18-1043-\nLPS, an action involving both Novartis and HEC. D.I. 197 at 32. There, Judge Stark construed \ncertain claim preambles in the '405 patent reciting, inter alia, \"A method for treating relapsing\u00ad\nremitting multiple sclerosis in a subject in need thereof, comprising ... \" as a \"limiting statement \nof purpose.\" C.A. No. 18-1043-LPS, D.I. 561 at 5. But HEC takes Judge Stark's construction one \n6 step too far. Although Judge Stark rejected Novartis' argument that the claims \"require an actual \neffect,\" id. at 8-9 (\"The Court agrees with Defendants and is not persuaded that anything in the \nclaims, specification, or prosecution history warrant reading into the claims an efficacy \nlimitation.\") , he nevertheless recognized that \"the general purpose of the invention is to achieve a \nsafe and effective manner of treating MS,\" id. at 9. Here, by specifically excluding efficacy, \nHEC's construction would import a negative limitation into the preamble untethered from the \nintrinsic record, and would undermine the general purpose of the invention of the '179 patent: to \nachieve a safe and effective manner of treating multiple sclerosis, or an efficacious purpose. \nAccordingly, the Court construes the preamble \"A method for treating relapsing remitting multiple \nsclerosis in a patient in need thereof' as a limiting statement of purpose. \nB. \"a patient\" \nClaim Term Plaintilrs Defendants' The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \nNovartis: \"a Plain and ordinary \npatient\" meaning: A patient \nPlain and ordinary diagnosed with RRMS that \nHEC: meaning: Any person is not presently taking a \"a patient\" means \n\"a/the/said under the care of one daily dose of 0.5 mg \"a RRMS patient\" or more medical fingolimod a patient\" professionals pharmaceutically \n(claim 1) acceptable salt form of \nfingolimod \nDuring the Hearing, while the parties agreed that a \"patient\" can be construed as \"an RRMS \npatient,\" Tr. 24: 17-22; 25: 19-20, HEC maintains that the term needs further construction to specify \nthat such RRMS patient is not presently taking a daily dose of 0.5 mg fingolimod. Tr. 26:6-7; \n29:7-8. \n7 Starting with the claims, the disputed \"patient\" terms appear in claim 1 of the '179 patent, \nwhich recites: \n1. A method for treating relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in ! \npatient in need thereof, the method comprising: \n(a) identifying a patient at risk of contracting infection caused \nby varicella zoster virus by testing said patient for a history of \ninfection caused by varicella zoster virus, \n(b) vaccinating the patient at risk of contracting infection \ncaused by varicella zoster virus, and \n( c) administering orally fingolimod or a pharmaceutically \nacceptable salt thereof to said patient at a daily dosage of 0.5 \nmg, thereby limiting the risk of infection caused by varicella \nzoster virus. \n'197 patent at cl. 1 ( emphases added). The claim language , on its face, does not limit the \"patient\" \nto someone who is \"not presently taking\" a daily dose of 0.5 mg fingolimod. Neither is the \nsequential performance of steps ( a), (b ), and ( c) contingent on whether a patient is presently taking \na daily dose of 0.5 mg fingolimod. \nTurning to the specification, it states that \"the present invention relates to testing a patient \nfor a history of infection and vaccinating the patient prior to administration of fingolimod or a \npharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof at a daily dosage of 0.5 mg.\" '179 patent at Abstract; see \nalso id. at 8:38-46, 10:59-63. These patients are not limited to individuals \"not presently taking\" \na daily dose of 0.5 mg fingolimod. \nHEC argues that the inventors acted as their own lexicographers , pointing to two \ndefinitions in the specification where the inventors distinguished between \"a patient treated with \nfingolimod \" and \"a patient in need of prescribing fingolimod. \" D .I. 197 at 3 7-3 8; '179 patent at \n5 :31-36 (\"As herein defined, a patient treated with fingolimod (FTY720) refers to a patient \nreceiving fingolimod (FTY720), a phosphate derivative thereof (i.e. fingolimod-phosphate) or a \npharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for treating an inflammatory or autoimmune disease or \n8 disorder according to the invention , e.g. MS, e.g. RRMS.\"); id. at 5:37-40 (\"As herein defined, a \npatient in need of prescribing fingolimod refers to a patient suffering from an inflammatory or \nautoimmune disease or disorder according to the invention, e.g. a MS patient.\"). Although these \ndefinitions support the Court's construction that a \"patient\" be a \"RRMS patient,\" nowhere do \nthese definitions suggest, as HEC urges, that a \"patient\" must not be presently taking a daily dose \nof 0.5 mg fingolimod . Rather, the specification teaches that the claimed method applies to both \npatient populations-that is, to those not presently taking fingolimod , but also those who may have \nreceived MS treatment in the past. Id. at 5:41-49 (\"Patients treated with fingolimod (FTY720) and \nthe patients in need of prescribing fingolimod may be patients who have never received treatment \nfor an inflammatory or autoimmune disease or disorder, such as patients who have never received \na treatment for treating or preventing MS, as well as patients who previously received one or more \ntreatment for an inflammatory or autoimmune disease or disorder, for example who previously \nreceived one or more treatment for MS.\"). \nThese statements are in accord with other statements in the specification describing the \nmonitoring of patients for possible adverse events before and during fingolimod administration. \n'179 patent at 7:34-67. In one embodiment , the specification describes monitoring the patient and \n\"optionally interrupting \" the fingolimod administration to, for example, administer \"a second \ndrug\" to \"mitigate \u25a1 ... possible adverse events.\" Id. at 6:43-56. Thus, the specification does not \nexclude patients who may need to interrupt their fingolimod treatment so as to receive a varicella \nzoster virus vaccination to limit the risk of an infection. \nTurning to the prosecution history, HEC argues that, because the applicant referenced the \nclaimed method as a \"proactive\" form of infection prevention \"prior to administering fingolimod \", \nthen the \"foregoing screening and vaccination clearly contemplate a patient with RRMS that has \n9 yet to receive fingolimod. \" D.I. 197 at 38-39. In a submission to the USPTO, the Applicant \n\"submits that [prior art reference] does not teach the skilled artisan to practice proactive infection \nprevention methods prior to administering fingolimod , such as serological testing and, if indicated, \nvaccination, as claimed herein, much less teach proactive prevention measures for VZV \nspecifically .\" D.I. 196-1 at Appx1515 . But that submission does not compel a finding that a \npatient in the claimed step (a) must be one not presently taking fingolimod.1 \nIn sum, the Court will construe \"a patient\" to be \"a RRMS patient\" consistent with the \nparties' agreement. Tr. 24:17-22; 25:19-20. The intrinsic record does not countenance limiting a \n\"RRMS patient\" to one not presently taking a daily dose of 0.5 mg fingolimod or a \npharmaceutically acceptable salt form of fingolimod. \nC. Steps of \"identifying,\" ''vaccinating\" and \"administ ering\" \nClaim Tenn Plaintiff's Defendants' The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \nSteps of Plain and ordinary Steps must be Steps (a), (b), and (c) \n\"identifying,\" meaning: Steps (a), performed in order must be performed \n\"vaccinating\" and (b), and (c) must be and for the purpose of sequentially and for the \n\"administering\" performed treating RRMS with purpose of treating \n(claim 1) sequentially fingolimod RRMS \nThe parties agree that steps (a), (b), and (c) must be performed sequentially or \"in order.\" \nD.I. 197 at 56, 57. HEC seeks to clarify that the steps be performed sequentially with two \nadditional requirements: \"for the purpose of treating RRMS with fingolimod .\" Id. at 57. \n1 HEC neither argues prosecution history disclaimer nor addresses the \"clear and \nunmistakable \" standard the Court uses to find disclaimer. In re Lockwood, 679 F. App'x 1021, \n1027 (Fed. Cir. 2017); see generally D.I. 197 at 35-41. The preamble to Claim 1, which this Court has construed supra as a limiting statement of \npurpose, recites, \"A method for treating relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in a patient in need \nthereof, the method comprising ... \" '179 patent at cl. 1. Explaining that each step of the method \nmust be performed \"for the purpose of treating RRMS\" is consistent with the preamble , albeit \narguably redundant, as the preamble already requires the claimed method to be performed for the \npurpose of treating RRMS in a patient in need thereof. \nAs HEC notes, if the parties disputed redundancy alone, the Court would have no claim \nconstruction dispute to resolve. Tr. 34: 1-14 (\"If we agree that each step of the method has to be \nperformed for the purpose of treating an RRMS patient, then this is --truly is two ships passing in \nthe sea and there isn't a dispute.\"). Indeed, in view of the preamble, Novartis initially rejected \nHEC's addition as \"redundant. \" D.I. 197 at 56 (\"The addition is redundant to the claims' \npreambles, and thus would rendered [sic] them 'mere surplusage ' which would be improper .\"); id. \nat 61 (\"As the preamble gives life and vitality to the claim, the entire claim method must be \nperformed with a purpose of treating RRMS in a patient in need thereof. There is no reason to \nimport the treatment purpose into the body of the claim.\"). However, during the Hearing, Novartis \nargued something different, contending that HEC' s additional language would be \"imprecise \" \nbecause each step may be accomplished for a different purpose. Tr. 36:16-17; 36:23-37:2 (\"It is \ndebatable , and I don't think the parties even engaged on this debate, whether the step of identifying \nis for the purpose of treating RRMS. It may be for the purpose of just identifying whether or not \na patient is at risk of infection. \"); 38:7-11 (\"where Step A has 'a patient,' Step B has 'the patient,' \nand Step Chas 'said patient,' that is an indicator that each of these steps, you know, have a different \n11 referral to the patient and, therefore , may not have overall an identical purpose.\").2 Thus, Novartis' \nshifting views reveal a dispute over claim scope such that the Court must construe this term beyond \nthe parties' agreement that the steps be performed sequentially. See 02 Micro Int'/ Ltd v. Beyond \nInnovation Tech. Co., 521 F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\"When the parties raise an actual \ndispute regarding the proper scope of the[ ] claims, the court, not the jury, must resolve that \ndispute.\"). Accordingly, consistent with the intrinsic record, the Court concludes steps (a), (b), \nand (c) must be performed sequentiall y and for the purpose of treating RRMS. \nThe Court declines to adopt HEC's additional requirement that the sequential steps must \nbe performed for the purpose of treating RRMS \"with fingolimod. \" First, HEC's \"with \nfingolimod\" limitation is overly narrow. The steps of claim 1 recite: \n(a) identifying a patient at risk of contracting infection caused \nby varicella zoster virus by testing said patient for a history of \ninfection caused by varicella zoster virus, \n(b) vaccinating the patient at risk of contracting infection \ncaused by varicella zoster virus, and \n(c) administering orally fingolimod or a pharmaceutically \nacceptable salt thereof to said patient at a daily dosage of 0.5 \nmg, thereby limiting the risk of infection caused by varicella \nzoster virus. \n'179 patent at cl. 1. As Novartis explains, to add to each step the requirement that a patient be \nidentified , vaccinated and administered \"for the purpose of treating RRMS with fingolimod \" \nappears to require physicians to have already selected fingolimod to treat RRMS patients even \n2 Because Novartis' new position at the Hearing diverts from argument made in the Joint \nClaim Construction Brief, the Court declines to consider it. \"In this district, a Markman hearing \nis not the time to raise a new claim construct ion argument. \" CoolTVNetwork.com , Inc. v. \nBlackboard Inc., C.A. No. 19-291-LPS-JLH , 2020 WL 6536960, at *5 (D. Del. Nov. 6, 2020), \nreport and recommendation adopted, C.A. No. 19-291-LPS-JLH, 2021 WL 2010579 (D. Del. May \n20, 2021) (finding no error or abuse of discretion in Court's determination that \"new arguments \nmade for the first time at the claim construction hearing were untimely and waived\"). \n12 before these treatment steps are performed. But on its face, the claim language does not exclude \na method where a physician may be contemplating different treatment options (including \nfingolimod) for a RRMS patient while identifying a RRMS patient who is at risk of contracting \nvaricella zoster virus infection and vaccinating such patient.3 Second, adding \"with fingolimod\" \nto each step is confusing and incomplete in view of step ( c ), which contemplates administering \nfingolimod \"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\" Third, while HEC appears to make a \nprosecution history disclaimer argument , explaining that \"Novartis cannot now claim what it had \nto give up during prosecution\" by citing a series of amendments and rejections, D.I. 197 at 57-60, \nHEC does not explain how Novartis clearly and unmistakably disavowed claim scope.4 \nIn sum, the Court will construe \"steps of 'identifying ,' 'vaccinating' and 'administering \"' \nas \"[s]teps (a), (b), and (c) must be performed sequentially and for the purpose of treating RRMS.\" \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nThe Court will adopt the parties' agreed-upon constructions and construe the disputed \nclaim terms as described above. The Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum \nOpinion. \n3 In response, HEC contends this example \"is not the proper scope of the claim\" but \notherwise does not explain why Novartis' example does not render the \"with fingolimod\" \nlimitation overly narrowing. \n4 Indeed, HEC cites to no authority on prosecution history disclaimer whatsoever.
