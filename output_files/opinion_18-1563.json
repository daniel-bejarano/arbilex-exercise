Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nAnna Elizabeth Currier, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, \nWilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendants. \nJanuary 18, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION C~{C: C~ : \nPlaintiff Luis Clark, an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in \nSmyrna, Delaware, filed this lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging violations of \nhis constitutional rights. (D.I. 2) He appears prose and was granted permission to \nproceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. Before the Court are \nDefendants' motion to compel and motion for summary judgment. (0.1. 38, 40) \nPlaintiff did not file a response to either motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff alleges violations of his constitutional rights. His claims revolve around \nincidents that occurred before, during, and after the February 2017 prison uprising at \nthe James T. Vaughn Correctional Center when inmates took over C-Building , held \nhostages, and a correctional officer was killed. Plaintiff commenced this action in \nOctober 2018. \nDefendants moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b )(6) or, in the alternative, for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies. (D.I. 21) The Court denied the motion without prejudice and \nordered the parties to provide a report on limited discovery and summary judgment \ndeadlines. (D.I. 28, 29) Defendants sent a letter to Plaintiff in an attempt to confer as \nordered by the Court and, as of the date the joint status report was due, had received \nno response from Plaintiff. (D.I. 31) On November 19, 2020, Defendants served \nPlaintiff a request for production of documents, and on February 16, 2021 Defendants \npropounded interrogatories upon Plaintiff. (D.I. 33, 34) Plaintiff did not timely respond \n1 to either discovery request. On March 22, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to compel. \n(D.I. 38) Plaintiff did not file a response to the motion to compel. \nOn May 19, 2021, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the \ngrounds that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and to prosecute this \ncase. (D.I. 41, 42) Plaintiff did not respond to the motion within the required time\u00ad\nframe. On July 13, 2021, the Court entered an order giving Plaintiff a final opportunity \nto respond to the motion for. summary judgment on or before August 13, 2021. (D.I. \n43) Plaintiff did not file a response. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA court must grant summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of \ndemonstrating the absence of any genuine issues of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). If the burden of persuasion at trial would be on the \nnon-moving party, then the moving party may satisfy its burden of production by \npointing to an absence of evidence supporting the non-moving party's case, after which \nthe burden of production then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of \na genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 \nU.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, \n460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). \nMaterial facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. \nLamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 1771 181 (3d Cir. 2011). \"[A] dispute about a material \n2 fact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict \nfor the non-moving party.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). A non-moving party \nasserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing \nto particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, \nelectronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, ... admissions, \ninterrogatory answers, or other materials; or (8) showing that the materials cited [by the \nopposing party] do not establish the absence ... of a genuine dispute .... \" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(c)(1 ). The non-moving party's evidence \"must amount to more than a \nscintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than a preponderance.\" \nWilliams, 891 F.2d at 460-61. \nThe court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving \nparty and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 \nF.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). \"[T]he facts asserted by the nonmoving party, if \nsupported by affidavits or other evidentiary material, must be regarded as true .... \" \nAman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074, 1080 (3d Cir. 1996). If \"there is \nany evidence in the record from any source from which a reasonable inference in the \n[nonmoving party's] favor may be drawn, the moving party simply cannot obtain a \nsummary judgment.\" Id. \nFinally, the Court will not grant the entry of summary judgment without \nconsidering the merits of Defendants' unopposed motion. Stackhouse v. \nMazurkiewicz, 951 F.2d 29, 30 (3d Cir. 1991) (holding that a district court should not \n3 have granted summary judgment solely on the basis that a motion for summary \njudgment was not opposed.\"). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nThe Court turns to the issue of Plaintiffs failure to prosecute this case. \nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), a court may dismiss an action \"[f]or failure of the \nplaintiff to prosecute or to comply with [the Federal Rules] or any order of court .... \" \nAlthough dismissal is an extreme sanction that should only be used in limited \ncircumstances, dismissal is appropriate if a party fails to prosecute the action. Harris v. \nCity of Philadelphia, 47 F.3d 1311, 1330 (3d Cir. 1995). \nThe following six factors determine whether dismissal is warranted: (1) The \nextent of the party's personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary caused by \nthe failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a history of \ndilatoriness; (4) whether the. conduct of the party was willful or in bad faith; (5) the \neffectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of other \nsanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim or defense. Pou/is v. State Farm \nFire and Cas. Co., 747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir. 1984); see also Hildebrand v. Allegheny \nCty., 923 F.3d 128 (3d Cir. 2019). The Court must balance the factors and need not \nfind that all of them weigh against Plaintiff to dismiss the action. Emerson v. Thiel Coll., \n296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2002). \nAs discussed by Defendants, several factors warrant the sanction of dismissal. \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se and is responsible for prosecuting his case. He has taken no \naction since July 2, 2020, failed to respond to discovery requests, and failed to respond \n4 Defendants' motion to compel and motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff's failure to \nparticipate in discovery is prejudicial to Defendants as it affects their ability to defend \nthis case. Plaintiff's non-action in this case is testament to his dilatory behavior. \nPlaintiff proceeds in forma pauperis and, thus, it is doubtful that monetary sanctions \nwould be effective. There is serious doubt as to the merits of Plaintiff's claims, as the \nrecord indicates that he failed to exhaust numerous claims raised. Finally, it appears \nthat Plaintiff has abandoned the case. Upon consideration of the Pou/is factors, the \nCourt concludes that the factors weigh in favor of dismissal and that Plaintiff has failed \nto prosecute this case. Therefore, dismissal for failure to prosecute is appropriate.1 \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as moot Defendants' motion to \ncompel (D.I. 38); (2) grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment; and (3) dismiss \nthe case for Plaintiff's failure to prosecute. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n1 Because it is appropriate to dismiss this case for failure to prosecute, the Court does \nnot address the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies other than to note that it \nis clear from the record that Plaintiff did not administratively exhaust many of the issues \nraised. \n5 "}
