No. 19-201-LPS\nWAL-MART ASSOCIATES, INC., et al.,\nDefendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this ues, of December, 2021;\n\n1. Plaintiff has taken no action in this case since August 11, 2021, including failing to\noppose Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for lack of prosecution filed on May 18, 2021 and\nNovember 8, 2021. (D.I. 28, 36) On July 17, 2021, the Court entered an order for Plaintiff to\nrespond to the motion to dismiss on or before August 13, 2001. (D.I.30) He did not. Instead,\nhe sent a letter to the Court to confirm a November 8, 2021 court date when no heating had been\nset for that date. (D.I. 31) On September 27, 2021, the Court entered a second order for Plaintiff\nto respond to the motion to dismiss on or before October 22, 2021. (D.I. 35) Plaintiff was\nwarned that should he fail to file a response the Coutt would consider the motion to dismiss solely\non the submissions and could also dismiss the case for failute to prosecute. (/d) Plaintiff did not\nfile an opposition ot take any other action priot to the deadline. On November 4, 2021, Plaintiff\nadvised the Clerk\u2019s Office that he was not aware of the September 27, 2021 Order and a copy of the\norder was mailed to him the same day. On November 8, 2021, Defendant filed a renewed motion\nto dismiss for failure to prosecute. (D.I. 36) Plaintiff has yet to respond to the motions to dismiss\n\not take any action.\n\n2. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), a court may dismiss an action \u201c[fJor failure of the\nplaintiff to prosecute ot to comply with [the Federal Rules] or any order of court....\u201d Although\ndismissal is an extreme sanction that should only be used in limited circumstances, dismissal is\napptoprtiate if a party fails to prosecute the action. Harris \u00bb. City of Philadelphia, 47 F.3d 1311, 1330\n(3d Cit. 1995).\n\n3. The following six factors determine whether dismissal is warranted: (1) The extent\nof the party\u2019s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the advetsaty caused by the failure to meet\nscheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of\nthe party was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which\nentails an analysis of other sanctions; and (6) the metitoriousness of the claim or defense. Powlis v.\nState Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir. 1984); see also Hildebrand v. Allegheny Cty., 923\nF.3d 128 (3d Cir. 2019). The Court must balance the factors and need not find that all of them\nweigh against Plaintiff to dismiss the action. Emerson v. Thiel Coll, 296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n3. Several factors warrant the sanction of dismissal including Plaintiffs failure to\nrespond to Defendants\u2019 discovery requests, Plaintiff's failure respond to two motions to dismiss,\nPlaintiff's failure to prosecute the case, the prejudice to Defendants for Plaintiff's failure to respond\nto discovety requests, and Plaintiff's apparent dilatory behavior in prosecuting the case.\n\nTHEREFORE, it is ordered that:\n\n1. Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss ate GRANTED. (D.I. 28, 36)\n\n2. The Clerk of Coutt is directed to CLOSE the case.\n\n\u00a2\n\nQo\n\nHONORABLE LEONARD P. STARK\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n"}
