No. 22-1025-GBW\nDR. TIM BOULOS, et al., ;\n\nDefendants.\n\nRoger L. Dennis, Howard R. Young Correctional Institution, Wilmington,\nDelaware, Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDecember \\e , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nof\n\nWe\n\nwre te tine 7 States District Judge:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Roger L. Dennis, an inmate at Howard R. Young Correctional\nInstitution in Wilmington, Delaware filed this action on August 1, 2022. (D.I. 1)\nPlaintiff appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis.\n(D.I. 7) The Complaint does not refer to any statutes. Presumably the claims are\nraised pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Complaint also raises a supplemental\nstate claim. In addition, Plaintiff has filed a request for counsel. (D.I. 9) The\nCourt proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d\nCir. 2008). Plaintiff alleges that during spinal surgery Defendant Dr. Tim Boulos\n\u201cmessed something up that causes Plaintiff to have severe seizures.\u201d (D.I. 1)\nPlaintiff sues Defendant New Castle County Police Department \u201cfor violations of\nrights and misconduct.\u201d (/d.) Plaintiff sues Defendant Delaware Department of\nCorrection because it allows its officers to do anything to him including use of\n\nforce. (Id.)\n\nPlaintiff filed a second document on November 15, 2022 and requests\ncounsel. (D.I. 9) While the filing does not appear to be an amended complaint it\nrefers to individual police and/or correctional officers. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory damages.\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action swa sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is\nfrivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or\nseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) Gn\nforma pauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks\nredress from a governmental defendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions\nbrought with respect to prison conditions). The Court must accept all factual\nallegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro\nse plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his\npleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded,\nmust be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d\n\nErickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard\nused when deciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184\nF.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to\ndismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can\nbe granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A,\nthe Court must grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment\nwould be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at\n\n114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1)\ntake note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify\nallegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the\n\nassumption of truth; and (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual\n\n4\n\nallegations and then determine whether those allegations plausibly give rise to an\nentitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir.\n2016) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged\nwhen the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal,\n556 USS. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is\nplausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw\non its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Medical Claim\n\nPlaintiff alleges that during spinal surgery Defendant Dr. Tim Boulos\n\u201cmessed something up that causes Plaintiff to have severe seizures.\u201d (D.I. 1)\n\nAt most, Plaintiff alleges negligence which this does not rise to the level of a\nconstitutional violation. See Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 330-30 (1986). To\nthe extent Plaintiff seeks to raise a negligence claim under state law, in Delaware,\nmedical malpractice is governed by the Delaware Health Care Negligence\nInsurance and Litigation Act. 18 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 6801-6865. When a party alleges\nmedical negligence, Delaware law requires the party to produce an affidavit of\nmerit with expert medical testimony detailing: (1) the applicable standard of care,\n\n(2) the alleged deviation from that standard, and (3) the causal link between the\n\n5\n\ndeviation and the alleged injury. Bonesmo v. Nemours Foundation, 253 F. Supp.\n2d 801, 804 (D. Del. 2003) (quoting Green v. Weiner, 766 A.2d 492, 494-95 (Del.\n2001)) (internal quotations omitted); 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853. Because Plaintiff alleges\nmedical negligence, at the time he filed the Complaint he was required to submit\nan affidavit of merit as to each defendant signed by an expert witness. 18 Del. C.\n\u00a76853(a)(1). Plaintiff failed to accompany the complaint with an affidavit of merit\nas required by 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853(a)(1). Accordingly, the claim against Dr. Boulos\nwill be dismissed.\n\nB. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n\nThe DOC is a named defendant. Plaintiff alleges the DOC allows its\nofficers to subject him to force.\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution protects an\nunconsenting state or state agency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its\nown citizens, regardless of the relief sought. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,\n517 US. 44, 54 (1996); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89\n(1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). Hence, as an agency of the State\nof Delaware, the Department of Corrections is entitled to immunity under the\n\nEleventh Amendment. See e.g. Evans v. Ford, 2004 WL 2009362, *4 (D. Del.\nAug. 25, 2004) (dismissing claim against DOC, because DOC is state agency and\nDOC did not waive Eleventh Amendment immunity).\n\nThe DOC is immune from suit and, therefore, it will be dismissed.\n\nC. Municipal Liability\n\nPlaintiff sues Defendant New Castle County Police Department for\nviolations of rights and misconduct but otherwise does not describe or provide\nfacts of the alleged wrongful conduct. A municipality may only be held liable\nunder \u00a7 1983 when the \u201cexecution of a government\u2019s policy or custom... inflicts\nthe injury.\u201d Andrews v. City of Philadelphia, 895 F.2d 1469, 1480 (3d Cir. 1990).\n\nWhile a government policy is established by a \u201cdecisionmaker possessing\nfinal authority,\u201d a custom arises from a \u201ccourse of conduct. . . so permanent and\nwell settled as to virtually constitute law.\u201d Andrews, 895 F.2d at 1480 (citing\nMonell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, 436 U.S. 658\n(1978)). Accordingly, a plaintiff seeking to recover from a municipality must (1)\nidentify an allegedly unconstitutional policy or custom, (2) demonstrate that the\nmunicipality, through its deliberate and culpable conduct, was the \u201cmoving force\u201d\nbehind the injury alleged; and (3) demonstrate a direct causal link between the\nmunicipal action and the alleged deprivation of federal rights. Board of County\n\nComm \u2019rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997).\n\nThe claim against the New Castle County Police Department is plead in a\nconclusory manner without supporting facts. Indeed, Plaintiff has not pled that the\nCounty was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind any alleged constitutional violation.\nAbsent any allegation that a custom or policy established by the County directly\ncaused harm to Plaintiff, the claim cannot stand and will be dismissed.\n\nD. Request for Counsel\n\nPlaintiff s request for counsel states, \u201cI would like a pro bono lawyer on this\ncase because I know I have serious grounds, and that I could get paid more.\u201d (D.L.\n9 at 1) Apro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or\nstatutory right to representation by counsel. See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d\n187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).\nRepresentation by counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a\nfinding that a plaintiffs claim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d\nat 155.\n\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of\nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court\nin deciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include:\n(1) the merits of the plaintiffs claim; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s ability to present his or her\n\ncase considering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed\n\nupon him or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the\ndegree to which factual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue\nsuch investigation; (5) the plaintiffs capacity to retain counsel on his or her own\nbehalf; and (6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or\nexpert testimony. See Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir.\n2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155-56. The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor\ndeterminative. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.\n\nPlaintiff's only ground for counsel is that he \u201ccould get paid more\u201d ifhe had\none. The threshold issue for appointment of counsel is that there be a claim that\nhas arguable merit in fact and law, not that counsel could lead to a larger damages\naward. At this juncture there are no cognizable claims. Accordingly, Plaintiff's\nrequest for counsel is denied without prejudice to renew.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny without prejudice to renew\nPlaintiffs request for counsel (DI. 9); (2) dismiss the Delaware Department as\nimmune from suit and dismiss the Complaint pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(B)(), (ii), and (iii) and 1915A(b)(1) and (2). Plaintiff will be given\nleave to file an amended complaint.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nROGER L.
