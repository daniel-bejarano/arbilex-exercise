Fallon", "date": "01-18-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nPALINODE, LLC, )\nPlaintiff, 5\nv. 5 Civil Action No. 21-1378-MN-SRF\nPLAZA SERVICES, LLC and 5\nPROVANA, LLC, )\nDefendants. )\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 18th day of January, 2022, the court having considered defendant\nProvana, LLC\u2019s (\u201cProvana\u201d) motion for a protective order to limit electronic mail discovery (D.I.\n88), and the briefing associated therewith (D.I. 89; D.I. 90), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that\nProvana\u2019s motion for a protective order is DENIED without prejudice for the following reasons:\n\n1. Background. Plaintiff Palinode, LLC (\u201cPalinode\u201d) removed this action from\nstate court to the Middle District of Tennessee on September 18, 2020. (D.I. 1) On June 15, July\n7, and July 14, 2021, a Magistrate Judge in the Middle District of Tennessee held discovery\ndispute conferences relating to the issues currently pending before the court. (D.I. 80; D.I. 82;\nD.I. 86) In its July 15, 2021 Order, the court indicated that \u201cPalinode and Provana disagree as to\nthe scope of software development related discovery\u201d and ordered counsel to \u201ccontinue to confer\nregarding this disagreement, including as to particular search terms or custodians that may\nfurther specify the scope of production.\u201d (D.I. 86 at 1-2) Only if the parties were unable to\nreach agreement, the Order provided that Provana may \u201cfile an appropriate discovery motion by\n\nJuly 21, 2021.\u201d (Id. at 2)\n2. On July 21, 2021, Provana filed the instant motion for a protective order. (D.I.\n88) It is undisputed that the parties did not meet and confer regarding Provana\u2019s motion or the\nproposed search terms attached thereto. (D.I. 89 at 1; DI. 90 at 1)\n\n3. The case was subsequently transferred to the District of Delaware pursuant to a\nMemorandum Opinion and Order issued on September 28, 2021. (D.I. 99; D.I. 100) Provana\u2019s\nmotion for a protective order remains pending and was referred to the undersigned judicial\nofficer by the assigned District Judge. (D.I. 112)\n\n4. Legal Standard. Generally, a party may obtain discovery \u201cregarding any\nnonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the\nneeds of the case.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Under Rule 26(c)(1), the court may limit the scope\nof discovery upon a showing of good cause. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1). \u201cGood cause is\nestablished on a showing that disclosure will work a clearly defined and serious injury to the\nparty seeking closure.\u201d Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 786 (3d Cir. 1994)\n(internal quotations omitted). \u201cBroad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific examples\n... Will not suffice.\u201d Glenmede Trust Co. v. Thompson, 56 F.3d 476, 483 (3d Cir. 1995). Courts\nhave broad discretion in granting protective orders. See Monolithic Power Sys., Inc. v. Intersil\nCorp., C.A. No. 16-1125-LPS, 2018 WL 6113465, at *1 (D. Del. Nov. 19, 2018).\n\n5. Analysis. Provana\u2019s motion for a protective order is denied for failure to show\ngood cause. See Glenmede, 56 F.3d at 483 (\u201cBroad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by\nspecific examples . . . will not suffice.\u201d). Provana alludes to the policy of Rule 26(c) \u201cto protect\na party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense,\u201d but\nit does not provide any details as to how the electronic mail discovery sought by Palinode would\n\nresult in any such annoyance, oppression, undue burden and/or expense. (D.I. 88 at 1-2)\n6. Provana must also satisfy its obligations to meet and confer with Palinode about\nits proposed search terms before seeking relief from the court. After three rounds of discovery\ndisputes on related issues, the Middle District of Tennessee expressly ordered Palinode and\nProvana to confer regarding their disagreement regarding the scope of software development\nrelated discovery. (D.I. 88 at 1-2) Yet Provana has taken the position that it was not necessary\nto meet and confer with counsel for Palinode before proposing its search terms to the court. (D1.\n90 at 1) This court\u2019s discovery dispute procedures are consistent with the July 15, 2021 Order\nfrom the Middle District of Tennessee in requiring the parties to meet and confer on the specifics\nof a dispute prior to raising the issue with the court.! The District of Delaware also provides\nguidance to counsel on matters relating to the discovery of electronically stored information in\nthe form of the Default Standard for Discovery, Including Discovery of Electronically Stored\nInformation (\u201cESI\u201d). Consideration of the Default Standard should be incorporated into the\nparties\u2019 discussions during the meet and confer process.\n\n7. Conclusion. IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff's request for a protective order is\nDENIED without prejudice. (D.I. 88) Prior to renewal of any further motion practice on this\ntopic, the parties are directed to review the District of Delaware\u2019s Default Standard for\nDiscovery, Including Discovery of Electronically Stored Information (\u201cESI\u201d), and comply with\n\nthe undersigned judicial officer\u2019s discovery dispute procedures located at\n\n' See https://www.ded.uscourts.gov/judge/magistrate-judge-sherry-r-fallon; Forms Tab;\nDiscovery Matters \u2014 Procedures \u2014 Revised 07/12/2021 (instructing counsel \u201cto first verbally\ndiscuss the issues/concerns before seeking the Court\u2019s intervention.\u201d).\n\n3\nhttps://www.ded.uscourts.gov/sites/ded/files/chambers/Discoverv%20Matters%20-\n\n%20Procedures%20-%20Revised%207-12-21 pdf.\n\n8.
