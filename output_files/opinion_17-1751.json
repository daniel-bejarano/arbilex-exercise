T\nhe Court, having reviewed Defendant\u2019s Daubert  motion to exclude expert\ntestimony as to the \u201csequencing file\u201d limitation (\u201cMotion\u201d), (D.I. 558), and the briefing related \nthereto, (D.I. 559; D.I. 598; D.I. 630), having heard argument on September 22, 2021, (D.I. 687 (hereinafter \u201cTr.\u201d)), and having considered the relevant legal standards, see 360 Heros, Inc. v. GoPro, Inc., --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2021 WL 5050879, at *1-2 (D. Del. Nov. 1, 2021), hereby ORDERS that the Motion is DENIED for the reasons that follo w. \n2. Defendant\u2019s opening brief in support of the Motion makes two arguments.  (D.I.\n559 at 1)  Defendant first argues that \u201cPA\u2019s technical expert \u2014Dr. Kevin Almeroth\u2014has applied \nan understanding of the [claim] term \u2018sequencing file\u2019 that is not consistent with the Court\u2019s construction.\u201d  ( Id.; see also id. at 2 -3)  Here again, though, as Defendant did in its Daubert  \nmotion regarding the \u201cfile\u201d limitation, (see D.I. 713 at 5 n.3), instead of pointing to specific portions of Dr. Almeroth\u2019s expert reports that are purportedly objectionable, Defendant instead references a few snippits of Dr. Almeroth\u2019s deposition testimony in which he responded to \u201chypothetical[s]\u201d posed by Defendant\u2019s counsel, (D.I. 559 at 2-3 (citing D.I. 571, ex. I at 57-58, 178-80); see also  D.I. 598 at 1; Tr. at 185).  This is not sufficient to permit grant of the Motion\nbecause:   (a) it is not absolutely clear from these deposition snippits that Dr. Almeroth is 2 \n pressing an opinion violative of the Court\u2019s claim construction (he might be, but it is just hard for \nthe Court to tell for sure); (b) even if he was doing so, Defendant\u2019s approach leaves the Court at \na loss to know what portions of Dr. Almeroth\u2019s expert reports are being placed at issue here; and (c) relatedly, Defendant does not explain why such portions of those expert reports are at odds with the Court\u2019s construction.  So the Court can grant Defendant no relief on this ground. \n3. Second, Defendant contends that Dr. Almeroth\u2019s \u201copinions regarding the \npurported \u2018sequencing file\u2019 in [Google Play Music (\u2018GPM\u2019)] are based entirely on a foundational technical error\u201d and should thus be excluded.  (D.I. 559 at 1; see also id. at 3 -6)  On this front, \nDefendant argues that Dr. Almeroth\u2019s theory (that \u201cin [Google Play Music], his purported LIST file (made up of data from  is referenced during playback and to respond \nto control commands\u201d) is based on an error, because in actuality, \u201cdata from  \n is used to perform these functions.\u201d  ( Id. at 3 (citin g D.I. \n571, ex. B at para. 257))  But the Court does not read the cited paragraph of Dr. Almeroth\u2019s report to deny that GPM in some way utilizes .  Indeed, a few paragraphs later in his \nreport, Dr. Almeroth seems to acknowledge the use of .  (D.I. 571, ex. B at para. 265 (\u201cThe received LIST file for a given playlist that is stored  \n so that the playlist may be \nplayed in its sequence.\u201d); see also  D.I. 630 at 1, 4 (Defendant noting in its reply brief that \u201cit is \nnow undisputed that data from the received  (PA\u2019s sequencing file) is copied to \nthe , which is then used to control playback and respond to control \ncommands[.]\u201d); Tr. at 178)  And so this is not a proper ground for exclusion of this particular paragraph of Dr. Almeroth\u2019s report. \n3 \n 4. Having now addressed the two grounds for exclusion raised in Defendant\u2019s \nopening brief, the Court notes more generally that the issue underlying Defendant\u2019s Motion is \nDefendant\u2019s assertion that the claim construction for \u201csequencing file,\u201d (D.I. 447 at 2- 5), requires \nthat \u201cyou can\u2019t use a copy of the sequencing file to control playback and respon[d] to commands, you have to use the received file[,]\u201d (Tr. at 176; see also id. at 172- 73, 183).  The Court notes \nthat it agrees with Defendant that, based on the claim construction process that led to the construction for \u201csequencing file,\u201d this understanding of the meaning of the construction is accurate.   (See D.I. 331 at 19- 20; D.I. 350 at 1; D.I. 447 at 2- 5)  However, it appears that Plaintiff \npoint s to at least certain instances of GPM\u2019s operation that it contends comport with this \ninterpretation of the Court \u2019s construction.  (D.I. 598 at 1- 2, 4 (cases 1, 2 and 3); Tr. at 186- 90, \n198)  Moreover, this is not a summary judgment motion.  So on this recor d (i.e., where the back \nand forth regarding these infringement theories occurred in answering and reply briefs relating to a Daubert  motion), it is not appropriate for the Court to do what Defendant wants it to do\u2014to \nmake a finding of non- infringement (i.e ., a finding that \u201cPA cannot rely solely on Cases 1, 2 \nand/or 3 to demonstrate infringement\u201d).  (D.I. 630 at 3)  \n5. Finally, Defendant\u2019s request for leave to file a summary judgment motion on \n\u201csequencing file[,]\u201d which was made in a footnote of its reply br ief, (D.I. 630 at 1 n.1; see also  \nTr. at 178), is DENIED.  The parties have had ample opportunity to raise summary judgment and \nDaubert  issues via a robust case- dispositive -stage motion process.  Indeed, the Court thinks that \nthe process was too robust, as  the parties (as parties regularly do in patent cases in this District), \nsee Dali Wireless, Inc. v. CommScope Techs. LLC , Civil Action No. 19- 952-MN, D.I. 290 at 2 \n(D. Del. Dec. 8, 2021), filed an outsized number of motions at the summary judgment/ Daubert  \nstage (there were 10 total, and Defendant filed seven of them, see D.I. 552; D.I. 555; D.I. 558; 4 \n D.I. 561; D.I. 564; D.I. 567; D.I. 569).  Few of those were meritorious.   In future cases, the Court \nwill need to figure out how to better  deal with how the summary judgment/ Daubert  process in \npatent cases has gotten so out of control.  But for now, surely no additional summary judgment \nfiling is warranted here.  \n6. Because this Memorandum Order may contain confidential information, it has \nbeen released under se al, pending review by the parties to allow them to submit a single, jointly \nproposed, redacted version (if necessary) of the Memorandum Order.  Any such redacted version shall be submitted no later than January 27, 2022 for review by the Court.  It should be accompanied by a motion for redaction that shows that the presumption of public access to judicial records has been rebutted with respect to the proposed redacted material, by including a factually -detailed explanation as to how that material is the \u201ckind of information that courts will \nprotect and that disclosure will work a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure.\u201d  In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Court will subsequently issue a publicly-available version of its Memorandum Order.   \n \nDated:   January 24, 2022   ____________________________________ \n      Christopher J.
