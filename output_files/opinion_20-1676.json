No. 20-1676-LPS\nGOLDEY-BEACOM COLLEGE,\n\nDefendant.\n\nCarole Bourne, Wilmington, Delaware, Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nKathleen Furey McDonough, Esquire, and Jennifer Penberthy Buckley, Esquire, Potter Anderson &\nCorroon, LLP, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 28, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nST. USS. Circuit Judge:\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Carole Bourne (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), who proceeds pro se and has been granted leave to\nptoceed in forma pauperis, commenced this employment discrimination action on December 10, 2020,\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, et seq. (DI. 2) Before the Court are Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss\nand Plaintiff's motion to strike and motion in limine. (D.I. 10, 14, 15)\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe Complaint is brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) and\nalleges Plaintiff was discriminated against on November 3, 2020, filed a charge of discrimination\nwith the Delaware Department of Labor on March 11, 2020, and her employment was terminated\non March 12, 2020.' (D.I. 2 at 2) The EEOC sent Plaintiff a notice of suit rights dated September\n11, 2020. (D.I. 2-1 at 1-3) Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, appointment of counsel, backpay,\nreinstatement, and compensatory damages. (D.I. 2 at 3) Approximately one month after Plaintiff\ncommenced this action, she submitted copies of a Goldey-Beacom College Spring Career Fair flier\nheld on March 11, 2020, a July 8, 2014 letter from VC Enterprises, and a screen shot of text\nmessages. (D.I. 5)\n\nDefendant moves to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (D.I. 10, 11) In turn, Plaintiff filed a motion to strike that\n\nmotion and a motion in limine. (D.I. 14, 15)\n\n\u2018Tt appears Plaintiff may have transposed certain dates. Because of this potential mistake, and\nbecause the Court is providing Plaintiff an opportunity to file an amended complaint, the Court will\ndeny without prejudice Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds of failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies.\n\n1\nIl, PLAINTIFF\u2019S MOTIONS\n\nA. Motion to Strike\n\nPlaintiff moves to strike Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cbecause Defendant never required\na motion in limine asking for supporting documents for relief\u2019 and, apparently because she now\nwishes to raise a breach of contract claim in addition to her ADA claim. (D.I. 14) Plaintiff provides\nno grounds for striking the motion to dismiss. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) (\u201c[TJhe court may strike\nfrom a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous\nmatter.\u201d). The motion will be denied.\n\nB. Motion in Limine\n\nPlaintiff filed a motion in limine to admit into evidence a letter from her physician,\nreferencing ongoing treatments as of April 4, 2021. (D.I. 15) Motions in limine allow the court,\namong other things, \u201cto exclude anticipated prejudicial evidence before the evidence is actually\noffered.\u201d Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 41 n.2 (1984). Here, it is not clear what relief Plaintiff\nseeks. In addition, it would be premature at this stage to make decisions about the admission of\nevidence. Hence, the Court will deny the motion.\nIV. MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nA. Legal Standards\n\nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires the\nCourt to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 223\n(3d Cir. 2004). \u201cThe issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is\nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410,\n\n1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court may grant such a motion to\n2\ndismiss only if, after \u201caccepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them\nin the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d Mazo v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d\n472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions. See Ashcroft\n\u00bb. Igbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Ath Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A plaintiff\nmust plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of\nShelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not dismissed, however, for imperfect statements of\nthe legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id, at 10. \u201cIn evaluating a motion to dismiss,\u201d the\nCourt \u201cmay consider documents that are attached to or submitted with the complaint . . . matters\nincorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, matters of public\nrecord, orders, [and] items appearing in the record of the case.\u201d Buck v. Hampton Twp. Sch. Dist., 452\nF.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018raise a right to relief\n\nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true (even if\ndoubtful in fact).\u201d Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 550\nUS. at 555). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d\nIqbal, 556 US. at 678. At bottom, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff's claim.\nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald assertions,\u201d Morse \u00bb. Lower Merion Sch. Dist.,\n\n132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \u201cunsupported conclusions and\n3\nunwarranted inferences,\u201d Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power \u00a2 Light Co., 113 F.3d 405,\n417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \u201cself-evidently false,\u201d Nam v. Fanver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d\nCir. 1996). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her Complaint,\n\u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted\nby lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) Gnternal quotation marks omitted).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nDefendant moves for dismissal on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to attach a copy of her\ncharge of discrimination and because the Complaint is devoid of factual allegations supporting an\nADA discrimination claim.\n\nA complaint will not suffice if it \u201coffers [merely] \u2018labels and conclusions\u201d or \u201c\u2018naked\nassertion{s]\u2019 devoid of \u2018further factual enhancement.\u201d Sve Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly,\n550 U.S. at 555, 557). Merely reciting an element of a cause of action or making a bare conclusory\nstatement is insufficient to state a claim. See Igba/, 129 S.Ct. at 1949.\n\nPlaintiffs Complaint is deficiently pled. Paragraph 12 of Plaintiff's Complaint states that a\ncopy of the charges filed with the EEOC is attached to the complaint and is submitted as a brief\nstatement of the facts of Plaintiffs claim.\u201d (See D.I. 2 at J 12) But the charge of discrimination was\nnot attached to the complaint. In addition, other invoking the ADA, the Complaint does not\n\ndescribe Plaintiff's alleged disability or her relationship with Defendant. As it now stands, the\n\n? Plaintiff's motion to strike also appears to be intended as an opposition to the motion to dismiss.\nIn it, Plaintiff refers to facts not included in the complaint and appears to attempt to add claims.\nThis is not the appropriate method for attempting to cure pleading deficiencies. See Commonwealth of\nPa. ex rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988) (stating it is improper to use\nopposition to motion to dismiss to amend complaint). Plaintiff is being granted leave to file an\namended complaint.\nComplaint lacks sufficient detail for Defendant to properly answer. Therefore, the Court will grant\nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, but will give Plaintiff leave to amend.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 10);\n(2) deny Plaintiff's motion to strike and motion in limine (D.I. 14, 15); and (3) give Plaintiff leave to\namend.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nCAROLE BOURNE,\nPlaintiff,\nv. Civ. No. 20-1676-LPS\nGOLDEY-BEACOM COLLEGE,\nDefendant.\nORDER\nAt Wilmington this 28th day of March, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\nts Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. (D.I. 10)\n2. Plaintiffs motion to strike is DENIED. (D.I. 14)\n8: Plaintiffs motion in limine is DENIED. (D.I. 15)\n4. Plaintiff is given leave to file an amended complaint on or before May 6, 2022. The\n\ncase will be dismissed should Plaintiff fail to timely amend the complaint.\n\nwl\n\nUNITED\u2018STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n"}
