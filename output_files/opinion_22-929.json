Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n            \n \n       \n December  9, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Sherry Washington  appears pro se  and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 6 ).  She commenced this action on July 12, 2022.  (D.I. \n2).  T he Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff sues  a numbers of government defendants and \ngroups of individuals .  (D.I. 2 at 3 ; see also  D.I. 9 -1).  The Complaint is basically \nunintelligible.   Plaintiff seeks relief as follows:  \nA relief for me and biological ancestor\u2019s family in the informative what section stopped not bothered at all , wanting all lifes body styles fundament \nfundamentals functions chromatic cells chromosome\u2019s  gene mind brains \nand all part s to them back over results and happenings propertys and any \nownings of their incarcerations and outs t he USAs and needing all \nmachinery on earth above way skys unusual abnormals way powering way non maneuvers  stopped s hut off d estroyed,  correctly . Non gadgetted  \nTo a unreluctance to relocate and indemnitys excuse to the court forgot , \ndignity prides memorys , sense, attentions \u2013  and wanting all the \ninformative what section want all undone and back.  \n \n(D.I. 2  at 14 ). \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d   Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept 2 \n all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \na pro se plaintiff.  Phillips  v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se , her \npleading is liberally construed and h er Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent st andards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. at 94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .   \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id.   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pur suant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to st ate a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A , the C ourt \nmust grant Plaintiff leave to amend h er complaint unless amendment would be \ninequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. \n2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Be ll Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not 3 \n dismissed, however, for imperfect statements  of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted.  See id. at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause t hey are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane  \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is pl ausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \n The allegations are basically unintelligible.  The Court finds them fantastical \nand/or delusional and insufficient to withstand the evaluation for frivolity dismissal under ' 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).  See Denton v. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 32- 33 (1992)  (a complaint \nmay be dismissed as lacking a basis in fact if it is premised upon \u201c allegations that are \nfanciful, \u2018fantastic,\u2019 = and >delusional[.] =@); Golden v. Coleman, 429 F. App= x 73 (3d Cir. \n2011).   In addition, a federal court may sua sponte dismiss a complaint for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) when the allegations within the Complaint Aare so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be \nabsolutely devoid of merit, .  . . wholly insubstantial, .  . . obv iously frivolous, ... plainly \nunsubstantial, .  . . or no longer open to discussion. @  Hagans v.  Lavine, 415 U .S. 528, 4 \n 536B 37 (1974) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) .  This is clearly the case \nhere.  T he Court =s experience and common sense lead it to recognize that the \ncomplaint does not state a plausible claim for relief  and, therefore, the Complaint will be \ndismissed.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 67 . \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will : (1) dismiss as moot Plaintiff\u2019s reques t for \nmediation (D.I. 5); and (2)  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B )(i) and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Amendment is futile.  \n An ap propriate O rder will be entered.
