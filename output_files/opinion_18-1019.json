At the end, the jury found Defendants Qiagen Sciences, LLC, \nQiagen LLC f/k/a Qiagen, Inc., Qiagen Beverl y, LLC f/k/a Qiagen Beverly, Inc., Qiagen \nGaithersburg, LLC, f/k/a Qiagen Gaithersburg, In c., Qiagen GmbH, Qiagen N.V. and Jonathan \nArnold (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d or \u201cQiagen\u201d) to have willfully infringed claims of two patents \nof Plaintiffs ArcherDX, LLC and the General Hosp ital Corporation (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d).  \n(See D.I. 465).  Presently before  the Court are Defendants\u2019 re newed motion for judgment as a \nmatter of law or, alternatively, for a new trial on infringement, invalidity and damages, motion for \na new trial on willfulness and motion for remittitur ( See D.I. 495).  In addition, Plaintiffs move for \ninjunctive relief, ongoing royalty, enhanced damages, supplement al damages and pre- and post-\njudgment interest.  ( See D.I. 494).  For the reasons set forth below, the Court will deny Defendants\u2019 \nmotions for judgment as a matter of law and new trial, grant Defendants\u2019  motion for remittitur, \ndeny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for enhanc ed damages, deny Plaintiffs\u2019 mo tion for injunction with leave \nto renew after an evidentiary hearing, grant-in-p art Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for ongoing royalty and grant \nPlaintiffs\u2019 motions for suppl emental damages and pre- a nd post-judgment interest. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs and Defendants are in the business of biomedical technology.  Plaintiffs and \nDefendants provide products referred to as assa y \u201ckits\u201d that allow users to prepare and analyze \nnucleic acids using next generation sequencing technology.  ( See D.I. 1 \u204b\u204b 19-20, D.I. 330 at 1).  \nThe kits enable users to detect gene mutations associated with various cancers and have applications in both the clini cal and research space.  ( See D.I. 1 \u204b 1, D.I. 130 \u204b 19, D.I. 330 at 1).  \nAt issue in this case are two of Plaintiffs\u2019 patents: U.S. Patent No. 10,017,810 (\u201cthe \u2019810 \npatent\u201d) and U.S. Patent No. 10,450,597 (\u201cthe \u2019597 patent\u201d).  The \u2019810 pa tent is directed to 2 methods of determining o ligonucleotide sequences.  ( See D.I. 130 \u204b 18).  The \u2019597 patent is \ndirected to methods of preparing and analyzing nucle ic acids.  ( See id.).  Plaintiffs have developed \nand now sell various assay kits that use technology covered by both patents.  ( Id. \u204b\u204b 19-20).  \nDefendants also developed and now sell kits  used to detect gene mutations.  ( See D.I. 330 at 1).  \nOn July 10, 2018, Plaintiffs filed suit allegi ng that Defendants infr inged the \u2019810 patent.1  \n(See D.I. 1 \u204b\u204b 41-55).  On October 30, 2019, after the \u2019597 patent had issued, Pl aintiffs filed an \namended complaint, adding a claim for infringement of the \u2019597 patent.  ( See D.I. 130 \u204b\u204b 41-55).  \nOn August 21, 2021 the Court reversed its previ ous denial of summary judgment of no literal \ninfringement of the \u2019810 pate nt after further argument.  ( See D.I. 447).  Thus, the issues left for \ntrial were literal infringement of  the \u2019597 patent and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents \nfor the \u2019810 patent.  \nFrom August 23, 2021 to August 27, 2021, the Cour t presided over a jury trial.  ( See D.I. \n485, 486, 487, 488, 489).  The jury found that Defendant s willfully infringed claims 16, 17 and 19 \nof the \u2019810 patent and claims 1, 5 and 19 of the \u2019597 patent.  ( See D.I. 465 at 2-4).  In addition, the \njury found none of th ese claims invalid.  ( See id. at 5-7).  The jury awarded Plaintiff $841,756 in \nlost profits damages for sales of RNA-related products in th e United States, $1,593,762 in royalty \ndamages for sales of DNA-related products in the United States and $2,240,303 in royalty damages \nfor sales outside the United States.  ( See id. at 8).  \n \n1  Plaintiff also initially  asserted claims of mi sappropriation of trade secrets, false advertising, \nbreach of fiduciary duty, deceptive trad e practices and tor tious conduct.  ( See D.I. 1 at \u204b 1).  \nPrior to trial, Plaintiffs elected to withdraw  their claims of trade secret misappropriation, \nfalse advertising, deceptive trade practices and tortious interference.  ( See D.I. 413).  On \nAugust 3, 2021, Plaintiffs accepted an offer of  judgment from Defendants pursuant to Rule \n68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for their breach of  fiducia ry duty claims.  ( See \nD.I. 423). 3 On September 20, 2021, the Court entered judgment on the jury verdict under Rule 58(b) \nof the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure.  ( See D.I. 482).  On October 18, 2021, Defendants renewed \ntheir motion for judgment as a matte r of law on the issues of infringe ment, invalidity and damages, \nor, in the alternative, moved for a new trial.  ( See D.I. 495).  In addition, Defendants moved for a \nnew trial on willfulness and remittitur of damages.  ( See id.).  On October 18, 2021, Plaintiffs \nmoved for enhanced damages, injunction, ongoing royalty, supplem ental damages and pre- and \npost-judgment interest.  ( See D.I. 494).   The parties briefing on post-trial motions was completed \non December 15, 2021.  ( See D.I. 513, 514).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Judgment as a Matter of Law \nJudgment as a matter of law may be entered ag ainst a non-moving party if the Court \u201cfinds \nthat a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentia ry basis to find for the party on \n[an] issue.\u201d   F ED. R. CIV. P. 50(a)(1).   Judgment as a matter of  law is appropriat e \u201conly if, viewing \nthe evidence in the light most fa vorable to the nonmovant and givi ng it the advantage of every fair \nand reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find \nliability.\u201d  Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp. , 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993).  Entry of \njudgment as a matter of law is a remedy to be invoked only \u201csparingly.\u201d  CGB Occupational \nTherapy, Inc. v. RHA Health Servs. Inc. , 357 F.3d 375, 383 (3d Cir. 2004). \nFollowing a jury trial, a renewed motion for j udgment as a matter of  law under Rule 50(b) \nmay be granted only if th e movant demonstrates \u201cthat the jury \u2019s findings, presumed or express, \nare not supported by substantial ev idence or, if they were, that the legal conclusion(s) implied [by] \nthe jury\u2019s verdict cannot in law be supported by those findings.\u201d  Pannu v. Iolab Corp. , 155 F.3d \n1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (alteration in original) (i nternal quotation marks omitted).  Substantial \nevidence is such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the 4 finding under review.  See Enplas Display Device Corp. v. Seoul Semiconductor Co. , 909 F.3d \n398, 407 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  In determining whether s ubstantial evidence suppor ts the jury verdict, \nthe Court may not make credibil ity determinations, weigh the evidence or substitute its own \nconclusions for that of the jury where the r ecord evidence supports mu ltiple inferences.  \nSee Lightning Lube , 4 F.3d at 1166.  \nB. Motion for a New Trial  \n\u201cA new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part  of the issues in an \naction in which there has been a trial by jury, fo r any of the reasons for which new trials have \nheretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States.\u201d  F ED. R. CIV. P. 59(a).  \nCommon reasons for granting a new trial are: (1) the jury\u2019s verdict is against the clear weight of \nthe evidence and a new trial is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice; (2) there exists newly discovered evidence that would likely alter the outcome of the trial; (3) improper conduct by an \nattorney or the Court unfairly influenced the verdict; or (4) the jury\u2019s verdict was facially \ninconsistent.  See Ateliers de la Haute-Garonne v. Broetje Automation-USA Inc. , 85 F. Supp. 3d \n768, 775 (D. Del. 2015).   \nThe decision of whether to grant a new tria l is a question committed to the Court\u2019s \ndiscretion.  See Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc. , 449 U.S. 33, 36 (1980).  Unlike the standard \nfor judgment as a matter of law, the Court need not view the evidence in the light most favorable \nto the verdict winner when ruling on a motion for a new trial.  See Ateliers , 85 F. Supp. 3d at 775.  \n\u201c[N]ew trials because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence are proper only when the \nrecord shows that the jury\u2019s verdic t resulted in a miscarriage of ju stice or where the verdict, on the \nrecord, cries out to be overturned  or shocks [the] conscience.\u201d  Williamson v. Consol. Rail Corp. , \n926 F.2d 1344, 1353 (3d Cir. 1991). 5 III. DISCUSSION \nA. Defendants\u2019 Motions  \n1. Patent Infringement  \n\u201cTo prove infringement, the patentee must s how that an accused product embodies all \nlimitations of the claim either literall y or by the doctrine of equivalents.\u201d  Cephalon, Inc. v. Watson \nPharms., Inc. , 707 F.3d 1330, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 201 3).  \u201cA two-step analysis  is employed in making \nan infringement determination.\u201d  Intell. Ventures I, LLC v. Canon Inc. , 104 F. Supp. 3d 629, 637-\n38 (D. Del. 2015) (citing Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,  52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed. Cir. \n1995)).  \u201cFirst, the court mu st construe the asserted  claims to ascer tain their meani ng and scope.\u201d  \nId.  Second, the trier of fact must \u201ccompare th e properly construed claims with the accused \ninfringing product\u201d to determine whether the pr oduct embodies the claims as construed.  Id.  \u201cThis \nsecond step is a question of fact.\u201d  Id. (citing Bai v. L & L Wings, Inc.,  160 F.3d 1350, 1353 (Fed. \nCir. 1998)).  \nThe jury unanimously found that Defendants in fringed the asserted claims of the \u2019597 \npatent and the \u2019810 patent.  Defendants argue that no reas onable jury could have found \ninfringement of either patent.  For the r easons set forth below, the Court disagrees.  \na. Infringement of the \u2019597 Patent \nThe jury found that using QIAseq Target ed DNA Panels, QIAseq Targeted RNAscan \nPanels, QIAseq Immune Repertoi re RNA Library Kits, QIAseq Index Kits for the Illumina and \nIon Torrent platforms and GeneR ead QIAact Kits (collectivel y \u201cthe \u2019597 Accused Products\u201d) \ninfringes claims 1, 5 and 19 of the \u2019597 patent.  ( See D.I. 465 at 3-4).2  Qiagen challenges the jury\u2019s \n \n2  The jury found that Defendants directly infringed by using the \u2019 597 Accused Products and \nalso induced and contributed to infringement  by their customers\u2019 use of the \u2019597 Accused \nProducts.  The arguments Defendants raise challenging th e findings of induced and 6 finding that the \u2019597 Accused Products include two elements in the assert ed claims: the \u201ctarget-\nspecific primer\u201d and the \u201ctarget-sp ecific hybridization sequence.\u201d  ( See D.I. 497 at 1-8).   \nThe asserted claims of the \u2019597 patent require a \u201ctarget-spec ific primer.\u201d  ( See JX-003 (\u2019597 \npatent), 77:10-20, 77:57-60, 78:48-51).  The Court construed this term to mean:  \na primer that has a level of complementarity between the primer and \nthe target such that there exists an annealing temperature at which the primer will anneal to and mediate amplification of the target nucleic acid and will not anneal to or medi ate amplification of non-\ntarget sequences present in a sample \n(D.I. 254 at 1-2).  Defendants contend that \u201c[n]o reasonable jury could have concluded\u201d that the \naccused forward primer (\u201cFP\u201d) is a target-specific primer because it \u201cann eals to the complement \nof the artificial adaptor sequence ligated to all fragments  in a sample.\u201d  (D.I . 497 at 2).  The crux \nof Defendants\u2019 argument is that the FP cannot be  target-specific because it effectively binds \u201cto \nall sequences in a sample.\u201d  ( See id. at 3).  In support of this conten tion, Defendants point to \ntestimony that an adaptor primer  \u201c[b]y itself\u201d will not \u201cdistingu ish target from off-target\u201d \nsequences.  (Tr. at 268:4-24).  Defendants argue th at this evidence shows th at the adaptor sequence \n\u201cis [a] sequence shared across all or mo st libraries.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at 3).  \nThe jury, however, heard substantial evidence to the contrary.  First, at trial, Plaintiffs\u2019 \nexpert Dr. Lennon testified that  \u201cthe FP primer in the QIAGEN workflow, target s the ligated \nadaptor\u201d and thus satisfies the Court\u2019s construction of \u201ctarget-sp ecific primer.\u201d  (Tr. at 501:2-\n502:25).  Second, contrary to Defe ndants\u2019 contention, the jury h eard testimony that the FP binds \nonly to \u201ca very small proportion of the molecules\u201d in a sample.  (Tr. at 617:11-618:2).  Dr. Lennon \nexplained that although the adaptors  are present in all molecules in a sample, the FP binds to the \n \ncontributory infringement are directed only to the underlying act of direct infringement.  \nTherefore, the Court does not separa tely address indir ect infringement. 7 adaptor complement , which is only present in  a fraction of the molecule s.  (Tr. at 618:21-620:19 \n& 635:8-636:20).  The jury was entitle d to credit Dr. Lennon\u2019s testimony.  \nIn addition, Defendants argue that the jury\u2019s fi nding is \u201cinconsistent w ith the Court\u2019s claim \nconstruction\u201d because the FP works \u201cin conjunc tion with the GSP\u201d to target and amplify \nsequences.  ( See D.I. 497 at 4).  As Plaint iffs point out, however, \u201cnothing in the Court\u2019s \nconstruction precludes the target-specific primer from \u2018mediat[ing] amplification of the target nucleic acid\u2019 (D.I. 254 at 1- 2) in concert with anothe r primer.\u201d  (D.I. 500 at 5).  The jury was thus \nallowed to believe Dr. Lennon\u2019s te stimony that \u201cthe FP in concert with the GSP selects for and \namplifies the molecules that we\u2019re interested in outlining.\u201d  (Tr. at 497:10-18).  In the face of \nconflicting evidence about whether the claim limitati on \u201ctarget-specific primer ,\u201d as construed, was \nmet by the \u2019597 Accused Products, the jury was enti tled to believe the evidence that the FP meets \nthe Court\u2019s construction. \nFinally, Defendants assert that no jury could find the FP to be the target-specific primer of \nthe \u2019597 patent because the FP was identified as a universal primer for the \u2019810 patent.  (D.I. 497 \nat 2). The Court sees no reason why the FP could not serve different  functions with respect to the \ntwo different patents, and Defendant s cite no case law that forecloses such a finding as a matter of \nlaw.  Furthermore, as Plaintif fs argue, the \u2019597 patent adopts a different definition of \u201ctarget \nnucleic acid\u201d than the \u2019810 patent.\n3  (D.I. 500 at 2-3 (citing JX -001 (\u2019810 patent), 10:50-53, D.I. \n254 at 1 and JX-003 (\u2019597 patent), 15:30-32)).  Therefore, it was pr oper for the jury  to find that \n \n3  The \u2019810 patent defines \u201ctarget nucleic acid\u201d as follows: \u201ca nu cleic acid molecule \ncomprising both the nucleic acid sequence which is to be determined and the known target \nnucleotide sequence.\u201d (JX-001 (\u2019 810 patent), 10:50-53). In c ontrast, the Court used the \n\u2019597 patent\u2019s definition of  \u201ctarget nucleic acid\u201d to construe  the term with respect to that \npatent: \u201ca nucleic acid molecule of interest (e.g., a nucleic acid to be analyzed).\u201d (D.I. 254 \nat 1; JX-003 (\u2019597 patent), 15:30-32).  8 the FP is both the \u2019810 patent\u2019s \u201cfirst adapto r primer\u201d and the \u2019597 pate nt\u2019s \u201ctarget-specific \nprimer.\u201d \nThe asserted claims of the \u2019597 patent also require the target-speci fic primer to have a \n\u201ctarget-specific hybridiz ation sequence.\u201d  ( See JX-003 (\u2019597 patent), 77:10-20, 77:57-60, 78:48-\n51).  Per the Court\u2019s construction, a target-s pecific hybridization sequence is one that:  \nhas sufficient comple mentarity with a se quence of the double-\nstranded target nucleic acid to enable hybridization between the \ntarget-specific primer and a sequence in/of the double-stranded \ntarget nucleic acid.  \n(D.I. 254 at 2).  Defendants contend that \u201cPlain tiffs put on no evidence identifying the accused \nDouble Stranded Target Nucleic Acid (\u201cDSTNA\u201d) at trial,\u201d and thus no jury could find that the \n\u2019597 Accused Products met this clai m limitation.  (D.I. 497 at 6).  Defendants proceed to undercut \ntheir own argument, however, by ci ting to testimony Plaintiffs\u2019 expert  offered at trial, identifying \nthe accused DSTNA.  ( See D.I. 497 at 6 (citing Tr. at 591: 17-592:13)).  Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. \nLennon, identified the DSTNA, explaining that \u201caft er the GSP extends, we have a double-stranded \nDNA molecule\u201d to which the FP then binds (Tr.  at 634:1-635:5).  Defe ndants\u2019 own expert \nconceded that Dr. Lennon had identified this mo lecule as the required DSTNA.  (Tr. at 988:10-\n20).  Furthermore, as Plaintiffs note, \u201cQiagen does not dispute that [the identified DSTNA] \nincludes a sequence to which a hybridization se quence on the FP anneals.\u201d (D.I. 500 at 7).  \nDefendants argue, however, that the identifi ed molecule cannot be  the claimed DSTNA \nbecause it does not yet exist at the outset of the pr ocess and thus there would be a lack of antecedent \nbasis for \u201cthe double stranded target nucle ic acid\u201d in step b of claim 1.  ( See D.I. 497 at 7).  \nDefendants contend that \u201ca POSA [ i.e., a person of ordinary skill in the art] would not know which \n[DSTNA] is being referred to.\u201d  ( See id. ).  This, however, is a questio n of fact for the jury, and the \njury heard testimony that \u201ca person  of ordinary skill in  the art would\u201d unders tand what is being 9 referred to because \u201c[i]t\u2019s like reading a reci pe\u201d in which the order of the ingredients is \ninterchangeable.  (Tr. at 1135:2-15).  Therefore, the jury had a lega lly sufficient ev identiary basis \nto conclude that the identified DSTNA met the \u2019597 patent\u2019s claim limitation.  See Energizer \nHoldings, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n , 435 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting Bose Corp. \nv. JBL, Inc. , 274 F.3d 1354, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\u201c[D]espite the absence of \nexplicit antecedent basis, \u2018[i]f th e scope of a claim would be r easonably ascertainable by those \nskilled in the art, then the claim is not i ndefinite.\u2019\u201d)). \nIn sum, the jury heard substantial eviden ce to support its finding that the \u2019597 Accused \nProducts contained both a target -specific primer and a target-s pecific hybridizat ion sequence.  \nThus, the Court must deny the Defe ndants\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law on infringement \nof the \u2019597 patent.  \nb. Infringement of the \u2019810 Patent \nThe jury found that the use of QIAseq Ta rgeted DNA Panels, QIAseq Targeted RNAscan \nPanels, QIAseq Immune Repertoi re RNA Library Kits and QIAseq  Index Kits for the Illumina \nplatform (collectively \u201cthe \u2019810 Accused Products\u201d) infringe  claims 16, 17 and 19 of the \u2019810 \npatent under the doctrine of equivalents.4  (See D.I. 465 at 2-3).  Defe ndants assert that no \nreasonable jury could have found infringement because the \u2019810 Accused Products lack three \nelements required by the asserted claims:  a \u201cs equence identical to a first and second sequencing \nprimers,\u201d \u201cadaptor primers\u201d and the \u201csequence identical to first and second sequencing.\u201d  ( See D.I. \n497 at 8-17).  \n \n4  As with the \u2019597 patent, the jury found that Defendants direct ly infringed and also induced \nand contributed to infringeme nt from their customers\u2019 use of the \u2019810 Accused Products, \nand the arguments Defendants raise as to indi rect infringement addr ess only the underlying \nact of direct infringement. \n 10 First, the asserted claims of the \u2019810 patent require the universal oligo tail adaptor to have \na sequence identical to a first and second sequencing primers.  ( See JX-001 (\u2019810 patent), 75:44-\n67, 77:19-78:18, 78:22-23; D.I. 146 at 1).  At trial, Pl aintiffs identified P7 and Read 2 as the first \nand second sequencing primers.  (Tr. at 468: 15-19, 474:9-475:11 & 594:2-14).  Defendants\u2019 sole \ncontention with respect to this limitation is that Pl aintiffs failed to prove that P7 was a \u201csequencing \nprimer.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at 8-11).  \u201cSequencing prime r\u201d was not a term the parties sought to have \nconstrued.  ( See D.I. 123).  Therefore, the jury was free to rely on the plain and ordinary meaning \nof the term in deciding infringement.  See ePlus, Inc. v. Lawson Software, Inc., 700 F.3d 509, 520 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012).   Both parties agree that P7 is a primer that \u201canneals fragment s to a flow cell,\u201d a \nprocess called cluster generation.  ( See D.I. 497 at 8, D.I. 500 at 9 (citing Tr. at 595:19-596:16)).  \nDr. Lennon testified that \u201cpeople of  ordinary skill, understand\u201d clus ter generation to be \u201cpart of \nthe sequencing process.\u201d  (Tr. at 473:18-474:8).  In addition, Dr. Lennon stated that this understanding was evidenced by one of Qiagen\u2019s own documents.  ( See id. ).  Although \nDefendants\u2019 expert testif ied that he did not thin k P7 was a \u201csequencing primer\u201d (Tr. at 911:1-\n912:19), the jury was entitled to assess credibility and believe Plaintiffs\u2019 expert over that of \nDefendants.  Therefore, the Court sees no reason to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict.  \nSecond, the claims require a second adaptor prim er (\u201cSAP\u201d) with a \u201c portion identical to a \nfirst sequencing primer.\u201d  ( See JX-001 (\u2019810 patent), 75:44-67, 77:19-78:18, 78:22-23; D.I. 146 at \n2).  Qiagen argues that the jury had a legally insufficient basis to find that (a) P7 is the first \nsequencing primer and (b) the SAP has a seque nce identical to a \u201cportion\u201d of P7.  ( See D.I. 497 at \n11-12).  Defendants\u2019 first argument fails for the reasons noted above.  As to the second argument, \nthe jury heard testimony that al l 24 nucleotides of the SAP are identical to all 24 nucleotides of \nP7.  (Tr. at 915:15-19).  Defenda nts do not dispute this testimony, but rather argue that it was 11 improper for the jury to find that identical \u201cto a portion\u201d may include identical to the whole.  ( See \nD.I. 497 at 11-12).  As Defendants note in the ne xt section of their br ief, however, the \u2019810 \nspecification states that \u201c[a] portion can comprise all or only a subset of the nucleotides comprised \nby the molecule.\u201d  (JX-001 (\u2019810 patent), 9:1-5).  Thus, the jury was enti tled to credit Dr. Lennon\u2019s \ntestimony that the SAP \u201chas a seque nce identical to a portion of the first sequencing primer.\u201d  (Tr. \nat 481:18-21).  \nThird, Qiagen contends that \u201cno reasonable jury could have concluded that the [second \ntarget-specific primer (\u201cSTSP\u201d)] has [a] sequence identical to a second sequencing primer,\u201d as \nrequired by the asserted claims.  (D .I. 497 at 13).  As Pl aintiffs point out, ho wever, the jury heard \nevidence that the SIP (the accused STSP) has a 19-ba se sequence that is identical to 19 of the 34 \nbases in Read 2 (the second sequencing prime r).  (D.I. 500 at 11 (citing Tr. at 610:14-613:1 & \n916:12-24)).  The jury was not precluded from finding that \u201cidentical\u201d may in clude identical to a \nportion, and therefore was allowe d to find for Plaintiff.  See ePlus, Inc. v. Lawson Software, Inc., \n700 F.3d 509, 520 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (\u201cIn the absence of  . . . a construction, however, the jury was \nfree to rely on the plain and ordina ry meaning of the term . . . .\u201d).   \nFinally, Defendants challenge the jury\u2019s findi ng that the SIP infringes the second target-\nspecific primer limitation under th e doctrine of equivalents.  ( See D.I. 497 at 13-17).  An accused \ndevice that does not literally infringe may still in fringe under the doctrine of  equivalents \u201cif there \nis \u2018equivalence\u2019 between the elem ents of the accused product or pr ocess and the cl aimed elements \nof the patented invention.\u201d  Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co. , 520 U.S. 17, 21 \n(1997).  Analysis under the doctrine of equivale nts follows one of two tests endorsed by the \nSupreme Court \u2013 the insubstantial differences test or function-way -result test \u2013 both of which are \nperformed on an element-by-element basis.  Bo th parties use the function-way-result framework 12 in their post-trial briefs.  ( See D.I. 497 at 13, D.I. 500 at 12).  The function-way-result test evaluates \nwhether the element in the accused product perfo rms substantially the same function, in \nsubstantially the same way, to achieve substantially the same result as the claimed element.  Warner-Jenkinson, 520 U.S. at 39-40.   \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs put forth insuffic ient evidence to meet this test.  Regarding \nthe first element, Defendants contend that \u201cthe  function of a target-specific primer in the \u2019810 \npatent is to anneal to and mediate amplification of  [the] target nucleic acid\u201d  and thus \u201cenrich[] the \ntarget sequence.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at 13-14).  They argue  that the SIP does not perform substantially the \nsame function because it (a) \u201cbind[s] to [the ] common tail sequence added by the GSP\u201d and (b) \nenriches the target sequence only \u201cwhen paired with the adaptor primer.\u201d  ( Id.).  Defendants\u2019 \narguments rely on the incorrect assumption that  the jury was required to credit Defendants\u2019 \nexpert\u2019s testimony of the STSP\u2019s \u201cfunction\u201d over that of Dr. Lennon, Plaintiffs\u2019 expert.  Dr. \nLennon identified three functions of the STSP th at the SIP performs: \u201c[1] amplifying the \namplification product of Step 2, [2] producing an amplification product that  is capable of being \nsequenced, and also [3] reducing undesirable amplification products  by being paired with the \nsecond adaptor primer.\u201d  (Tr. at 487:21-488:15).  The jury was enti tled to credit this testimony.  \nWith respect to the second element, Defendants argue that the SIP does not perform in \nsubstantially the same way because (a) it does not  \u201cbind to [the] known targ et nucleotide sequence\u201d \nand (b) it is not \u201cnested with respect to the first- target-specific primer.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at 14).  Again, \nDefendants fail to show why the jury was require d to credit Defendants\u2019 narrow interpretation of \n\u201csubstantially the same way\u201d over that of Plaintiffs.  Dr. Lennon testified that the SIP performs the functions he identified in \u201cthe same way,\u201d by, for example, amplifying \u201ct he product of the first 13 amplification reaction by pairing with a nested o pposing primer.\u201d  (Tr. at  488:2-15).  The jury was \nfree to make credibility dete rminations or to accept Pl aintiffs\u2019 expert testimony.  \nDefendants also contend that the \u2019810 patent \u201cspecifically teaches no t to use hemi-nested \nprimers.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at 14).  Therefore, they argu e that it was improper for the jury to find that the \naccused SIP works in substantially the same way as  the claimed STSP because the SIP is not nested \nwith respect to the firs t target-specific primer, and thus th eir products use a hemi-nested method.  \n(See id.).  Per the Court\u2019s construction, a \u201cnested\u201d pr imer is one that \u201canneal [s] to a nucleic acid \nsequence 3\u2019 downstream and in the sa me direction as\u201d the other primer .  (D.I. 146 at 2).  At trial, \nexperts explained that primers are said to be \u201chemi-nested\u201d when \u201cthe primers on one side are \nnested, and the primers on the other side are not.\u201d  ( E.g., Tr. at 219:20-22).  As Plaintiffs explain, \nhowever, \u201cthere are two types of hemi-nested me thods \u2013 those in which only the adaptor primers \nare nested, and those in which only the target spec ific primers are nested.\u201d  (D.I. 500 at 13).  The \njury heard evidence from at least three witnesses that the \u2019810 patent discourages only one of the \nhemi-nested methods: methods in wh ich the target-specifi c primers are nested and adaptor primers \nare not nested.  (Tr. at 220:4- 24, 538:4-7 & 779:10-14).  Qiagen does not dis pute that its products \nuse the opposite approach : non-nested target-specific primers and nested adaptor primers.  ( See \nD.I 499 at 14; see also  Tr. at 779:10-18; D.I. 500 at 14).  As Plaintiffs point out, the \u2019810 patent in \nfact \u201cexpressly discloses\u201d the us e of nested adaptor primers.  (D.I. 500 at 14 (citing JX-001 (\u2019810 \npatent), 17:43-45) (\u201cThe use of two adaptor primers, as described herein [ i.e., nested adaptor \nprimers] can reduce, and in some embodiments eli minate, these problems.\u201d)).  The jury, therefore, \nhad an ample basis for rejecting Defendants\u2019 argument and deter mining that the SIP worked in \nsubstantially the same way as the claimed invention.  14 With respect to the third element, Defendants assert that no reasonable jury could find that \nthe SIP achieves substantially the same result as  the STSP because the resu lt of Qiagen\u2019s process \nis \u201csimply to copy everything that  was amplified in the first r ound of PCR rather than further \nenriching for the target nucleic acid of interest.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at 15).  Again, Defendants\u2019 argument \nasks the Court to disregard Plaintiffs\u2019 proffered evidence.  At trial, Dr. Lennon explained that the \nSIP and STSP achieve substantially the same result with respect to the three functions he identified.  \n(Tr. at 488:16-489:7).  This evid ence was unrebutted at  trial and Defendant s do not attempt to \nrebut it in their post-trial briefs.  ( See D.I 500 at 16, D.I. 497 at 15-17 & D.I. 514 at 7).  Rather, \nDefendants merely repeat their own expert\u2019s opi nion on the matter. In the face of conflicting \ntestimony about whether Qiagen \u2019s products perform substant ially the same function, in \nsubstantially the same way, to achieve substantially the same result, the jury was entitled to credit \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence.  \nIn sum, substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that  Defendants infringed the \u2019810 \npatent.  Therefore, the Court wi ll deny Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law on \ninfringement of the \u2019810 patent.  \n2. Patent Validity \nAn issued patent is presumed valid. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282.  To overcome this presumption, \na party must show by clear and convincing evidence that the patent is invalid.  See Hewlett\u2013\nPackard Co. v. Bausch & Lomb, Inc.,  909 F.2d 1464, 1467 (Fed. Cir. 1990).  Defendants \nchallenged the validity of the \u2019810 patent and \u2019597 patent at trial on multiple grounds.  ( See D.I. \n465 at 5-7).  Defendants now argue that no reasonable jury could ha ve found that Defendants failed \nto meet their burden with respect to two of thos e grounds:  written descript ion and definiteness.  \nFor the reasons set forth be low, the Court disagrees.  15 a. Written Description \nFor a patent to be valid, its specification must contain a written description that \u201cclearly \nallow[s] persons of ordinary skill in the art to  recognize that [the inve ntor] invented what is \nclaimed.\u201d  Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 598 F.3d 1336, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ( en banc ).  \n\u201cIn other words, the test for sufficiency is whet her the disclosure of the application relied upon \nreasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed \nsubject matter as of  the filing date.\u201d  Id.  \nStarting with the \u2019810 patent, Defendants cont end that although the patent \u201ccovers a non-\nnested STSP,\u201d a \u201cPOSA reading the \u2019810 specifi cation would not understand the \u2019810 inventors \nwere in possession of such an invention.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at 17).  Defendants point to testimony that the \npatent only explicitly in cludes examples in which the STSP was nested.  (D.I. 497 at 17 (citing Tr. \nat 953:16-23 & 211:14-17)).  Plai ntiffs, however, point to testim ony that identifi ed support for \nnon-nested STSP\u2019s in the specification.  (Tr. at  1126:17-1127:15 (\u201c[T]here is a written description \n. . . in the body of the patents, description text, that describes the workflow in a way that\u2019s not \nnested.\u201d)).  The jury was entitled to  credit Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence.   \nIn addition, Defendants assert that inventor Dr. Iafrate cl aimed that \u201che and the other \ninventors had tried\u201d the process wi th non-nested target-specific primer s \u201cbut it did not work.\u201d  (D.I. \n514 at 9).  Defendants overstate that evidence.  At trial, Dr. Iafrate testifie d that he had worked on \nthe non-nested approach and \u201c[i]t worked,\u201d only \u201cthe  nested approach worked better.\u201d  (Tr. at \n215:12-18).  As Plaintiffs stat e, however, \u201cthe claims do not require the STSP to achieve an on-\ntarget rate or level of specific ity.\u201d  (D.I. 500 at 21).  Thus, Dr . Iafrate\u2019s testimony does not support \nDefendants\u2019 contention that \u2019810 fails the written description requirement.  The jury had sufficient \nbasis for finding that Defendants failed to meet their burden.  16 Turning to the \u2019597 patent, Defendants argue th at \u201ca POSA reading the [patent] would not \nunderstand the inventors possessed an invention that  ligated a universal adaptor onto the sequence \nof interest and called a primer th at anneals to the universal sequen ce, a target-specific primer.\u201d  \n(D.I. 497 at 18).  As Plaintiffs not e, Defendants fail to point to any relevant testimony in support \nof this contention.  ( See D.I. 500 at 21-22).  Rather, Defendants cite Dr. Metzker\u2019s testimony \nregarding his noninfringem ent theories which do not \u201ceven purpor t[] to apply the relevant legal \nstandard.\u201d  (D.I. 500 at 21-22 & D. I. 497 at 18-19).  This is not clear and convincing evidence.  \nDefendants have thus given no ba sis on which the Court may grant judgment as a matter of law \nwith respect to their writ ten description claims.  \nb. Indefiniteness \nPatent claims must be \u201csufficiently definite.\u201d Allen Eng\u2019g Corp. v. Bartell Indus., Inc. , 299 \nF.3d 1336, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  \u201c[A] patent is inva lid for indefiniteness if  its claims, read in \nlight of the specification delineating the patent, a nd the prosecution history, fail to inform, with \nreasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\u201d  Nautilus, Inc. v. \nBiosig Instruments, Inc. , 572 U.S. 898, 901 (2014).  Definiteness \u201cis amenable to resolution by the \njury where the issues are factual in nature.\u201d  BJ Servs. Co. v. Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. , 338 \nF.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Bombardier Recreational Prods. Inc. v. Arctic Cat Inc., \n785 F. App\u2019x 858, 867 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\u201cBecause the jury found the claims indefinite, we presume \nthat it resolved the underlying fact ual issues relating to the construc tion of [the disputed term] in \n[the accused infringer\u2019s] favor.\u201d). \nStarting with the \u2019810 patent, Defe ndants argue that the \u2019810 cl aims are indefi nite \u201cbecause \nthere is no description in the specification of wh at constitutes a sequence in the adaptor primers \nbeing identical to a porti on of the sequencing primers.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at 19).  That is , \u201cthe patent does 17 not inform a POSA if a \u2018portion\u2019 means one , two, three, four, etc. nucleotides.\u201d  ( Id.).  Defendants\u2019 \nentire argument rests on the following eight  lines cited from the trial transcript:  \nQ: And what is your opinion here? \n A: This is a different argument.  Th is means it\u2019s inde finite.  It means \n\u2013 the Court has construe d two terms, universal  oligonucleotide tail \nadaptor that has sequences identical  to a first and second sequencing \nprimer.  It\u2019s also construed a sec ond target-specific primer that also \nhas sequences identical to a second sequencing primer. The \nspecification doesn\u2019t help you whet her these two second sequencing \nprimers are the same of if they are different. \n (Tr. at 954: 15-23).  This excerpt fail s even to mention the word \u201cportion\u201d\n5 and is not clear and \nconvincing evidence that the patent fails to info rm a POSA, with reasonab le certainty, about the \nscope of the invention as to what a portion of the seque ncing primers means.6  Therefore, the jury \nwas entitled to find for Plaintiffs on the issue of indefiniteness.  \nTurning to the \u2019597 patent, Defendants cont end that \u201ca POSA would have no idea which \n\u2018 . . . double stranded target nucleic  acid\u2019 is being referred to th roughout claim 1 element b.\u201d  (D.I. \n \n5  As Plaintiffs note, this te stimony appears to address Defenda nts\u2019 other argument regarding \nindefiniteness ( i.e., regarding whether the second sequencing primer in the STSP and in \nthe universal oligonucleotide tail adap tor must be the same primer).  ( See D.I. 500 at 22). \n \n6  Plaintiffs argue that Qiagen has waived this issue as this theory of indefiniteness was \n\u201cnever presented to the jury.\u201d (D.I. 500 at  22).  Although Defenda nts dedicated a brief \nsentence to this theory ( i.e., that the word \u201cportion\u201d is indefinite) in their Rule 50(a) motion, \nPlaintiffs are correct in st ating, \u201cthe only indefinitene ss argument that Dr. Metzker \npresented to the jury involved  a different theory \u2013 namel y, whether the \u2018second sequencing \nprimer\u2019 in the STSP and in th e universal oligonucleotide ta il adaptor must be the same \nprimer.\u201d  (Tr. at 1161:5-9; D.I. 500 at 22 (citing Tr. at 954:14-23)).  Defendants counter \nthat the question of indefiniteness is \u201cultimately  a question of law for the Court to decide.\u201d \n(D.I. 514 at 10).  If the Court s hould decide this question as a matter of law on the record \nbefore it, the Court finds in favor of Plaint iffs because (as discussed above) Defendants \nhave failed to meet their burden of show ing definiteness by any \u2013 let alone clear and \nconvincing \u2013 evidence.  Thus, the Court de clines to reach the question of whether \nDefendants waived this theory.  \n 18 497 at 20).  Defendants repeat th eir arguments regarding non-infr ingement of the \u2019597 patent ( i.e., \nthat there is a lack of anteced ent basis for \u201cthe\u201d DSTNA in clai m 1 element b).  The Court dealt \nwith these arguments above, a nd Defendants cite to no new te stimony in support of their \nindefiniteness claim.  ( See supra  \u00a7 III.A.1.a).  As noted above, Pl aintiffs offered testimony that \u201ca \nperson of ordinary skill in the art would\u201d understa nd what is being referred to because \u201c[i]t\u2019s like \nreading a recipe\u201d in which the orde r of the ingredients is interchang eable.  (Tr. at 1135:2-15).  The \njury, therefore, had legally sufficient basis to find that Defendants failed to meet their burden in proving either patent inva lid for indefiniteness.  See Energizer Holdings, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade \nComm\u2019n , 435 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\u201c[D]espite the absence of \nexplicit antecedent basis, \u2018[i]f th e scope of a claim would be r easonably ascertainable by those \nskilled in the art, then the claim is not indefinite.\u2019\u201d). \nIn sum, the Court sees no reason to disturb the jury\u2019s findings that th e \u2019810 and \u2019597 patents \nare not invalid.  \n3. Willfulness  \nA determination of willfulness requires a finding of \u201cdeliberate or intentional\u201d \ninfringement.  SRI Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc. , 14 F.4th 1323, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Plaintiffs \nmust show that \u201cthe accused in fringer knew of the patent-in-suit,  and knowingly or intentionally \ninfringed the patent after acquiring that knowledge.\u201d  Jackson v. Seaspine Holdings Corp. , No. CV \n20-1784-RGA, 2022 WL 610703, at *7 (D. Del. Feb. 14, 2022) (citing Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian \nRivera Maynez Enters., Inc. , 946 F.3d 1367, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2020)).  The jury found that \nDefendants willfully infringed both  the \u2019597 and \u2019810 patents.  ( See D.I. 465 at 8).  Defendants \nask the Court to grant a new trial on the jury\u2019s will fulness finding.  (D.I. 497 at 20).  For the reasons \nset forth below, the Court denies Defendants\u2019 request. 19 Defendants first argue that a new trial on willfulness is warranted because there was \n\u201cinsufficient evidence to establish th at infringement was willful.\u201d  ( Id. at 21.).  The Court disagrees.  \nFirst, Qiagen itself admits that Dr. Lader, a vice president of research and development at Qiagen, \nhad been aware of Plaintiffs\u2019 patents since 2015 and reviewed the \u2019810 pa tent in 2018 regarding \nits relevance to Qiagen products and the \u2019597 patent later.  (D .I. 497 at 20-21 & D.I. 500 at 19).  \nBoth he and Dr. Wang, senior director for research  and development at Qiagen, \u201ccarefully studied\u201d \nPlaintiffs\u2019 patents. (D.I. 497 at 20).  In addition, Plai ntiffs point to Dr. Lader\u2019s admission that \nQiagen maintained a \u201cpatent watch list\u201d for other companies but chose not to include Archer on the list. (D.I. 500 at 19 (citing Tr . at 681:15-683:21)).  This is su fficient evidence to support the \njury\u2019s finding that Defendants (a) had knowledge of the patents a nd (b) knowledge of infringement.  \nDr. Lader\u2019s assertion that he di d not \u201cbelieve\u201d Qiagen infringed either patent does not preclude a \nfinding of willfulness.  ( See D.I. 497 at 20-21 (citing Tr. at 691:7-692:20 & 701:4-10) (\u201cI believe \nQiagen\u2019s products do not infringe the \u2019597 patent . . . I found the claims to be rather confusing, \nbut, yes, I reached that conclusion.\u201d)).  The ju ry was entitled to assess credibility and infer \nwillfulness from the evidence presented, particularly  given the fact that Dr. Lader admitted he was \n\u201cnot a patent expert.\u201d  (Tr. at 701:19-20).  This is  thus not a case \u201cwhere the verdict, on the record, \ncries out to be overturned.\u201d Williamson , 926 F.2d at 1353.  \nIn addition, Defendants argue a new trial on willfulness is wa rranted because \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 \ncounsel poisoned the well by maki ng legally impermissible argume nts\u201d before the jury when \ncounsel referenced Defendants\u2019 alleged failure to receive a fr eedom to operate opinion from in-\nhouse counsel.\n7  (D.I. 497 at 21).  First, as noted above , the jury heard substantial other evidence \n \n7  Defendants cite three instances in which Plai ntiffs referenced Qiagen \u2019s lack of a freedom \nto operate (\u201cFTO\u201d) at trial. (Tr. at 8 64:15-865:8, 1244:1-4 & 1245:14 -1246:5). Plaintiffs \ncounter that, in all three in stances, Plaintiffs were atte mpting to mitigate Qiagen\u2019s 20 on which it could properly base its finding.  Defendants point to nothing that suggests the verdict \nwas the result of improper prejudice.   Second, as Plaintiffs note, \u201ct he Court gave Qiagen the choice \nbetween a curative instruction and an opportunity to  address the purportedly prejudicial statements \nin closing arguments.\u201d  (D.I. 500 at 18 (citing Tr . at 1266:1-4)).  Defendants opted to address the \nissue in closing and then chose not to do so.  (T r. at 1266:5-8).  Having refused to take either \nopportunity to repair any damage , Defendants cannot now argue that  they believe the statements \nso prejudicial to have improperly influenced the jury verdict.  \nGiven the evidence in support of the jury\u2019s finding of willfulness, the Court denies \nDefendants\u2019 motion for new trial on willfulness.  \n \n\u201cimproper insinuation that Qiagen had receiv ed an exculpatory opinion.\u201d (D.I. 500 at 18). \nThe \u201cimproper insinuation\u201d to which Plai ntiffs refer is excerpted below:  \n \nQ: [What does Qiagen do] when it  thinks it\u2019s usin g somebody else\u2019s \ntechnology?  A: What QIAGEN does when it thinks it\u2019s \u2013 first of all, we have \u2013 I mean, I would say, a pretty good IP department, intellectual, property department, and these people  are interacting a lot with the \nR&D folks and they are discussi ng about patents or potential \ninfringement, if there is any. We  also very often use external \ncounsel, so we try to do our best to make sure that we  have the rights \nto sell the products we\u2019re selling. \n  (Tr. at 809:8-17). Defendants argue that Plai ntiffs\u2019 references to the FTO improperly asks \nthe jury to make an adverse inference based on the failure to  provide an opinion of counsel \nin violation of Knorr-Bremse . (D.I. 497 at 21 (citing Knorr-Bremse Systeme Fuer \nNutzfahrzeuge GmbH v. Dana Corp. , 383 F.3d 1337, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2004))). Plaintiffs \ncounter that such references were permi ssible because Defendants \u201copened the door\u201d by \nimplying they had received an FTO in the exchange cited above (and thus, Knorr Bremse  \nis inapplicable). (D.I . 500 at 18) (citing Hologic, Inc. v. Minerva Surgical, Inc. , 2018 WL \n3348998, at *2 (D. Del. July 9, 2018)). The C ourt finds that, regardless of whether \nPlaintiffs\u2019 statements violated Knorr-Bremse , Defendants are not enti tled to a new trial. \nTherefore, the Court declines to revisit whethe r such statements were  improper in light of \nKnorr-Bremse  and Defendants\u2019 own te stimony cited above.  21 4. Damages \nThe jury awarded Plaintiffs $841,756 in lost profits in conne ction with Defendants\u2019 RNA-\nrelated products sold in the Unites States , $1,593,762 as a reasonable royalty for sales of DNA-\nrelated products in the Unites States and $2,240,303 as a reasonable royalty on produc ts sold to \ncustomers outside the United States.  ( See D.I. 465 at 8). Defendants challenge the jury award of \nlost profits and foreign damages and seek re mittitur of the royalty for U.S. sales.   \na. Lost Profits \nTo be entitled to lost profits , Plaintiffs must \u201cshow a reas onable probability that, but for \nthe infringement, [they] would have made the sales made by\u201d Qiagen.  Presidio Components, Inc. \nv. Am. Tech. Ceramics , 875 F.3d 1369, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  At tria l, Plaintiffs sought to establish \nlost profits using the Panduit factors. (Tr. at 721:24-731:22).  \u201cThe Panduit test requires the \npatentee to show: (1) \u2018demand fo r the patented product\u2019; (2) \u2018abs ence of acceptable noninfringing \nsubstitutes\u2019; (3) \u2018manufacturing and marketing cap ability to exploit the demand\u2019; and (4) \u2018the \namount of profit that ... w ould have [been] made.\u2019\u201d  Georgetown Rail Equip. Co. v. Holland L.P. , \n867 F.3d 1229, 1240-41 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting Panduit Corp. v. Stahlin Brothers Fibre Works, \nInc., 575 F.2d 1152, 1156 (6th Cir. 1978)). \nDefendants challenge the lost pr ofits award, arguing th at (a) there was insufficient evidence \nfor the jury to find an absence of  non-infringing a lternatives, (b) there was no evidence that \u201cany \ncustomer purchased [Defendants\u2019] RNA panels because of the\u201d infringing technology and (c) \nPlaintiffs presented no market share analysis. For the reasons below, the C ourt denies Defendants\u2019 \nmotion.  \nFirst, Defendants contend that  Plaintiffs failed to show the absenc e of non-infringing \nalternatives because some eviden ce showed that Archer had \u201cmul tiple market competitors.\u201d  ( See \nD.I. 497 at 22).  As Plaintiffs note, however, \u201c[m]ere existence of a competing device does not 22 make that device an acceptable substitute.\u201d Presidio Components, Inc. v. Am. Tech. Ceramics \nCorp.,  702 F.3d 1351, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp.,  789 F.2d 895, \n901 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). Rather, whether a compe ting device should be considered an acceptable \nsubstitute is a question of fact for the jury.  See Minnesota Min. & Mfg. Co. v. Johnson & Johnson \nOrthopaedics , Inc., 976 F.2d 1559, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1992).  Here, the jury heard testimony from \nnumerous witnesses that the supposed competing products we re \u201cnot viable options,\u201d used \ntechnology that was \u201ca little bit anci ent,\u201d could lead to patients being \u201cwrongfully misdiagnosed,\u201d \ndid not work with RNA at all, or were not \u201ccompetitive.\u201d  (Tr. at 510:25-512:4, 356:13-357:13, 353:18-22, 360:17-362:3, 709:7-21 & 712:20- 713:11).  Much of the evidence Defendants claim \nundermines the jury\u2019s finding pertai ns to Illumina\u2019s RNA products.  ( See D.I. 497 at 22-23 (citing \nTr. 1-81:7-18, 383:11-384:7 & 388:12 -389:2)).  The jury, however, heard testimony that Illumina\u2019s \nproducts were inferior and thus not an acceptable substitute.  ( See, e.g. , Tr. at 356:22-357:13 \n(explaining that Illumina requires larger sample sizes from patients and thus leads to a more \n\u201ctraumatic\u201d experience and that th e technology used was \u201ca little bit ancient\u201d)).  In addition, much \nof the evidence Defendants cite in  support of their argument refers to Plaintiffs\u2019 co mpetition more \nbroadly (rather than in the market for which lost profits was awarded, i.e., RNA products in the \nUnited States).  ( See D.I. 497 at 22 (citing DX-327.145 (referring to  Archer\u2019s compe tition in \u201clife \nsciences more broadly\u201d) and Tr. at 331:1-1, 396:12-397:1, 705: 20-25, 712:3-11 & 1020:12-\n1030:17 (discussing library preparation in general) )).  Based on this evidence, the jury could \nreasonably have found that Plaint iffs met their burden in proving the absence of non-infringing \nalternatives.  \nSecond, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs are not  entitled to lost profits because they \n\u201cpresented no evidence that any customer\u201d pu rchased the infringing products because of the 23 patented technology.  (D.I. 497 at 24).  This argument fails as a matter of la w. A patentee is not \nrequired to provide direct evidence that custom ers bought the infringing products because of the \npatented technology to be entitled to an award of lost profits.  See Panduit , 575 F.2d at 1156 \n(establishing elements patentee is required to show  for an award of lost profits).  Regardless, \nQiagen\u2019s witness testified that  the patented \u201csingle primer extension\u201d technology is \u201cthe \nunderlying reason why [customers] work w ith us.\u201d  (Tr. at 713:18-714:15).  \nThird, Defendants assert that Plai ntiffs were required to put forth evidence of market share \nin order for the jury to properl y award lost profits.  The jury, however, awarded Plaintiffs lost \nprofits for 100% of Defendants\u2019 RNA sales in th e United States, thus implying a finding that the \nrelevant market was a two-supplier market.  In such a case, evidence  of market share is irrelevant. \nMentor Graphics Corp. v. EVE-USA, Inc. , 851 F.3d 1275, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (\u201cThe market \nshare theory is irrelevant in this case because the jury made a factual finding . . . that the relevant \nemulator market for sales to Intel was a two-supplier market.\u201d).   \nDefendants have failed to show that the jury\u2019s award of lost  profits must be overturned.  \nb. Foreign Damages \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs were not entitled to royalties for products sold to \npurchasers outside of the United States because (a) allowing foreign damages when method claims \nare asserted and infringement is  found under 35 U.S.C. 271(a) is c ontrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s \ndecision in WesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp. , 138 S. Ct. 2129 (2018) and (b) Plaintiffs \npresented insubstantial evidence that infringement in the United States was a substantial cause of the foreign sales.  \nFirst, at issue is the applicability of the Federal Circuit\u2019s holding in Carnegie Mellon Univ. \nv. Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. , 807 F.3d 1283 (2015) (\u201c CMU \u201d).  This matter was hotly \ncontested at trial.  Plaintiffs argued that CMU allowed the jury to use sa les made outside of the 24 United States to calculate damages for infringement in the United States if Archer could prove that \n(1) Defendants\u2019 infringement in the United States was a cause of the sale of that product and (2) \nDefendants made or sold the produ ct within the United States.  ( See D.I 452 & D.I. 457).  \nDefendants countered that doing so would \u201crun[] contrary to l ongstanding precedent\u201d that held \nthat performing steps of a patented method abroad is  not an act of infringement and thus a patentee \nhas no right to damages for such uses.  (D.I. 456 at 1-3).  After briefing on the matter was \ncompleted, the Court issued an order agreeing to a modified version of Plai ntiffs\u2019 proposed jury \ninstructions on damages calculated base d on sales to fore ign customers.  ArcherDX, LLC v. \nQIAGEN Scis., LLC , No. CV 18-1019 (MN), 2021 WL 3857460 (D. Del. Aug. 30, 2021).  The \nCourt reasoned,  \nThe issue here . . . is not whether the foreign uses of the patented \nmethods are infringing \u2013 they are not and Plaintiffs concede that. \nThe question is whether the sales of products that use the methods \nto foreign users can be used to measure damages for acts of infringement in the United States. United States patent law allows \n\u201cdamages adequate to compensate  for the infringement.\u201d Here, the \ninfringement is asserted under \u00a7 271(a), which, for the method \nclaims at issue, makes it an act of infringement to use the claimed methods in the United States. The claims for induced  infringement \nunder \u00a7 271(b) and contributory infr ingement under \u00a7 271(c) also \nrequire direct infri ngement under \u00a7 271(a). And, as I said, that \ninfringement must be performance of the method claim in the United \nStates.  In Carnegie Mellon University v. Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. , \n807 F.3d 1283 (Fed. Cir. 2015) [(\u201cC MU\u201d)], the Federal Circuit \naddressed calculation of damages for infringement of a method \nclaim that relied on the sales of products that perform that method. Recognizing the presumption ag ainst extraterritoriality, the CMU \ncourt nevertheless concluded that:   \n\u2018Where a physical produc t is being employed to \nmeasure damages for the infr inging use of patented \nmethods, . . . territoriality is satisfied when and only \nwhen any one of those domes tic actions for that unit \n(e.g., sale) is proved to be present, even if others of 25 the listed activities for that unit (e.g., making, using) \ntake place abroad.  Significantly, once one extends the extraterritoriality pr inciple to confining how \ndamages are calculated, it makes no sense to insist that the action respecting the product being used for \nmeasurement itself be an  infringing action. Thus, \nhere the claim is a method claim, but the damages-measuring product practices the method in its normal intended use.\u2019 \n . . . [Therefore,] CMU  makes clear that it is addressing damages for \ninfringement \u2013 that is, damages for actions in the United States \u2013 and is not expanding the statutor y requirement for infringement. \n \nId. at *1-2 (internal citations remove d).  The jury was thus instructed that it could award use sales \nof products that practice the patent ed method outside the United Stat es to measure damages if \u201c(1) \nQIAGEN\u2019s infringement in the Unites States was a substantial\n8 cause of the sale of that product, \nand (2) QIAGEN made or sold the product with in the United States.\u201d  (Tr. at 1207:9-15). \nNow, Defendants argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in WesternGeco implicitly \noverruled CMU .  (See D.I. 497 at 26).  The Court disagrees.  In WesternGeco , the Court held that \na patentee was entitled to damages for sales made abroad when infringement was found under \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(f)(2).  WesternGeco , 138 S. Ct. at 2137-39.  The C ourt reasoned that \u201cthe conduct \nrelevant to the statutory focus in [ WesternGeco ] is domestic.\u201d  Id. at 2137.  That is, infringement \nunder \u00a7 271(f)(2) regulated \u201cthe domestic act of  \u2018suppl[ying] in or from the United States\u201d \ncomponents of patented inventi ons for combina tion abroad.  Id. at 2138 (quoting 35 U.S.C. \n \n8  The Court amended Plaintiffs\u2019 proffered inst ructions by requiring a \u201csubstantial\u201d causal \nconnection.  As noted in the C ourt\u2019s prior orde r, \u201c[a]lthough CMU  does not refer to a \n\u2018substantial\u2019 causal connection, the Court unders tands that there must  be more than a \ntangential relationship between the infringem ent asserted and the volume of sales.\u201d  \nArcherDX, 2021 WL 3857460 at *2 n.8 (citing WesternGeco LLC , 837 F.3d at 1368 \n(Wallach, J., dissenting) (n oting that \u201cwhere the volum e of non-infringing sales is \nindependent of the extent of United States infr ingement, those sales should not be used as \na measure of damages flowing from the domestic infringement\u201d)).  26 271(f)(2)).  Therefore, lost-profits damages for sales made abroad were properly awarded as \u201ca \ndomestic application of \u00a7 284.\u201d  Id.  That holding is not inconsistent with CMU  and this Court\u2019s \nprior application of CMU to the case before it.  Although in CMU  and the present case, \ninfringement was found under \u00a7 271(a), \u201cthe conduct relevant to the statutory focus . . . is \ndomestic,\u201d i.e., use in the United States.  See CMU , 807 F.3d at 1306-07; WesternGeco , 138 S. Ct. \nat 2137.  Therefore, by allowing the jury to calculate damages for domestic infringement by using \nsales made abroad related to that infringement, the Court is not implicitly finding that infringement \noccurred abroad but rather is allowing the pate ntee to recover fully for harm committed in the \nUnited States.9   \nSecond, Defendants argue that \u201c[e]ven under Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of [ CMU ], Plaintiffs \nfailed to present substantial ev idence to support damages for sale s outside the U.S.\u201d  (D.I. 497 at \n28).  The Court disagrees.  As noted  in the Court\u2019s prior order, \u201c[i]n CMU , the Federal Circuit \nnoted that the products \u2018practice[] the method in  its normal intended use\u2019 and concluded that \ncausation to domestic infringing us es was established given the de sign, simulation, and testing of \nthe chips in California involved infringing uses and caused the worldwide sales.\u201d  ArcherDX, 2021 \nWL 3857460, at *1 n.6 (citing CMU , 807 F.3d at 1306-07 (\u201call of Ma rvell\u2019s sales are strongly \nenough tied to its domestic infrin gement as a causation matter\u201d)).  Here, Plaintiffs put forth \nevidence that \u201ccustomers in this industry require  data providing that prod ucts work;\u201d \u201ccustomers \nbuy Qiagen\u2019s products for the infringing technology;\u201d \u201cgenerating data to pr ove that infringing \ntechnology works required Qiagen to infringe the asserted pate nts;\u201d and \u201cQiagen\u2019s testing ( i.e., \n \n9  That being said, the Court takes De fendants\u2019 point that  to some extent CMU  is difficult to \nreconcile with othe r governing law.  See ArcherDX , 2021 WL 3857460, at *2.  Indeed, at \ntrial, the Court struggled with this issue.  Ab sent further direction fro m the Federal Circuit, \nhowever, the Court declines to  amend its previous holding. 27 infringement) of the infringing pr oducts occurred in [the] U.S.\u201d  (D.I. 500 at 29 (citing Tr. at 358:2-\n359:20, 713:18-714:15, 453:1-508:1 & 679:8-24 )).  The jury could thus reasonably infer from this \nevidence that Qiagen\u2019s domestic infringement (u se of the accused prod ucts) was a substantial \ncause of the sale of products abroad.  \nc. Remittitur  \nDefendants seek remittitur of the jury\u2019s award of $1,593,762 in royalties for sales of DNA-\nrelated products in the United States on the basi s that the award is higher than any estimate \nprovided by the parties\u2019 experts a nd appears to be the result of a mistake on the part of the jury.  \n(D.I. 497 at 29-30).  Defenda nts point out that both the lost profits award and the royalty award \nfor foreign sales match Plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s estimates to the dollar.   (D.I. 497 at 30 (citing Tr. at \n732:19 & 743:13-21)).  The $1,593,762 U.S. royalty aw ard, however, is much  higher than the \nestimate provided by Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, and, in fact is  equivalent to the ex pert\u2019s suggested award \nfor lost profits ($841,756) plus U.S. royalties ($752,006).  (Tr. at 743:15-21).  Defendants thus \nrequest the Court remit the aw ard to the highest amount presented at trial: $752,006.  \nPlaintiffs agree that \u201cthe jury intended to award Plain tiffs a 7% royalty for infringing DNA-\nrelated products in the United States.\u201d  (D.I. 500 at 30).  Plaintiffs, however, contend that Qiagen \nwaived its objection by failing to object to the verdict before the jury was excused.  ( See id.).  In \nsupport of this argumen t, Plaintiffs cite Frank C. Pollara Grp., LLC v. Ocean View Inv. Holding, \nLLC, 784 F.3d 177, 190-91 (3d Cir. 2015).  In Pollara , however, the court held, \u201cif a party fails to \nobject to an inconsistency in a general verdict before the jury is excused, that party waives any objection in that regard.\u201d  Id.  In Pollara , the issue was that the verdict was facially inconsistent. \nId.  (\u201cAppellants . . . complain that the jury\u2019s verdict was inconsistent because its finding of \nintentional misrepresentation by Cheng precludes a finding of negligen t misrepresentation by \nOMEI.\u201d).  Here, Defendants argue that remittitur is appropriate not because of an inconsistent 28 verdict but because the verdict is unsupported by the evidence and the result of mistake.  Plaintiffs \nhave not cited to any case law in which the rule in Pollara  is applied to cases like the one before \nthe Court.  Cf. Delaware & Hudson Ry. Co., Inc. v. Knoedler Mfrs., Inc. , 805 F. App\u2019x 149, 152 \n(3d Cir. 2020) (applying Pollara  in the context of a claim of inconsistent verdict); EMC Corp. v. \nZerto, Inc. , No. CV 12-956(GMS), 2016 WL 1291757, at  *6 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2016), aff\u2019d , 691 \nF. App\u2019x 623 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (same).  \nThere simply is no evidentiary basis to  support the $1,593,762 U.S. royalty award.  And \ngiven that both parties agree the jury award wa s the result of a mistake, the Court will grant \nremittitur of the jury\u2019s award for U.S. royalties to  the amount estimated by Plaintiffs\u2019 witness (the \nhighest amount presente d to the jury): $752,006.  See Smith v. Katz , 696 F. App\u2019x 582, 591 (3d \nCir. 2017) (\u201c[T]he remittitur is well established as a device employed when the trial judge finds \nthat a decision of the ju ry is clearly unsupported a nd/or excessive.\u201d) (quoting Cortez v. Trans \nUnion, LLC , 617 F.3d 688, 716 (3d Cir. 2010)); see also  Belardinelli v. Carroll , 773 F. Supp. 657, \n659 (D. Del. 1991) (granting remittitur because th e \u201cawards are not rationally related to the \nevidence and the evidence suggests th at the jury may have mistaken ly believed that compensation \nwas sought for the decedent\u2019s death\u201d); Lewis v. United States , No. 02-2958-STA-EGB, 2014 WL \n12828838, at *3-4 (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 26, 2014) (granting re mittitur due to jury\u2019s mistake in adding \nestimated damages shown at trial).   \nPlaintiffs may either accept the remittitur or r eceive a new trial on these damages.  See \nCortez v. Trans Union, LLC , 617 F.3d 688, 716 (3d Cir. 2010) (\u201c[T]h e court must offer a new trial \nas an alternative to a reduction in the award\u201d when remittitur is due to insufficient evidence.).   \nB. Plaintiffs\u2019 Motions \nBefore the Court are Plaintiffs\u2019 motions  for injunction, ongoing royalty, enhanced \ndamages, supplemental da mages and pre- and post -judgment interest.  29 1. Injunction \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to permanently en join Defendants from \u201co ffering [infringing] \nproducts and services approved fo r clinical diagnosis by a regulat ory body.\u201d (D.I. 496 at 1-2).  \nA permanent injunction does not  automatically \u201cissue once in fringement and validity have \nbeen adjudged.\u201d  eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C. , 547 U.S. 388, 393-94 (2006).  Rather, a \nplaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satis fy a four-factor test before a court may grant \nsuch relief.  A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) th at it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that \nremedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in \nequity is warranted; and (4) that the public in terest would not be disserved by a permanent \ninjunction.  Id. at 391; see also  Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co. , 695 F.3d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. \n2012).  \nIn support of their arguments for a permanent injunction, Plaintiffs re ly on evidence entered \nduring trial as well as new evidence in the form of several declarations \u2013 one from an expert, Dr. \nMaria Fe Paz, who previously submitted an expert report, but who did not testify at trial, and two \nfrom Invitae employees.\n10  (See D.I. 496 at 1-12 & D.I. 496, Ex. A-C; see also  D.I. 501 at 17). \nPlaintiffs relied heavily on thes e declarations to support their argum ents on direct competition, lost \nmarket share and the adequacy of monetary damage s to compensate them.  In response, Defendants \nattack the assertions an d opinions in the declara tions and request an ev identiary hearing on the \ninjunction issue.  ( See D.I. 501 at 17). The Court agrees that  a hearing at which witnesses can be \ncross-examined and their opinions tested would be helpful in making the credibility determinations \n \n10  In October of 2020, Invitae acqui red Archer.  (D.I. 496, Ex. B \u00b6 1). 30 necessary to decide whether injunctive relief shou ld issue.  Thus, the Court will deny Plaintiffs\u2019 \nmotion for an injunction subject to renewal after a hearing. \n2. Ongoing Royalties  \nPlaintiffs request ongoing royalt ies for all infringing products not enjoined of 10% for sales \nof infringing DNA-related products  and 15.5% for sales of infringi ng RNA-related products.  (D.I. \n496 at 14).  Defendants ask the C ourt to defer its decision on whet her to award an ongoing royalty \nuntil after appeal, or, in the case that the Court decides to award a royalty to do so at the rate \napplied by the jury.  (D.I. 501 at 18).  \nIt is within the Court\u2019s equitable discreti on to determine whether an ongoing royalty need \nbe imposed.  See Paice LLC v. Toyota Motor Corp. , 504 F.3d 1293, 1314-15 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \nAlthough an ongoing royalty is not automatic, \u201cthe Fe deral Circuit has indicated that a prevailing \npatentee should receive compensation for any continuing infringement.\u201d  Apple, Inc. v. Samsung \nElecs. Co. , No. 12-CV-00630-LHK, 2014 WL 6687122, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 25, 2014) (citing \nTelcordia Techs., Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc.,  612 F.3d 1365, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2010)).  Defendants \ndedicate just four words to arguing that an ongoing royalty would be inappropriate in this case.  \n(See D.I. 501 at 18 (\u201c[I]t should be denied.\u201d)).  Rather, Defendants argue that the decision should \nbe deferred until after any appeal is concluded.  The Federal Circuit, however, has indicated that \ndeferral of such a decision would render the judg ment not \u201cfinal\u201d and thus not fit for appeal.  \nWarsaw Orthopedic, Inc. v. NuVasive, Inc. , 515 F. App\u2019x 882, 882 (Fed . Cir. 2012) (\u201c[E]ven \nassuming Rule 54(b) would give this court jurisd iction over a claim that is \u2018final except for an \naccounting\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(c)(2), the case is not \u2018final\u2019 because the \ndistrict court has not ye t determined ongoing royaltie s. An ongoing royalty is  not the same as an \naccounting for damages.\u201d); Arctic Cat Inc. v. Bombar dier Recreational Prod. Inc. , No. 2016-2556, \n2016 WL 11726241, at *1 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (\u201c[T]his case  is not \u2018final\u2019 for purposes of section 31 1292(c)(2) until the district court renders a final determination on the ongoing royalties issue.\u201d).  \nTherefore, the Court will not de fer the decision.  Defe ndants have provided no substantive reasons \nfor why an ongoing royalty would be inappropriate in this case, thus the Court will use its equitable \ndiscretion to grant an ongoing royalty.  \nIn determining the ongoing royalty rate, the Co urt must consider: (i) the \u201cchange in the \nparties\u2019 bargaining positions, and the resulting change in economic circumstances, resulting from \nthe determination of liability,\u201d; (ii) \u201cchanged eco nomic circumstances, such as changes related to \nthe market for the patented products,\u201d; and (iii) any other \u201cpost-verdict fa ctor\u201d that would impact \n\u201cwhat a hypothetical negotiation would look like after the pr ior infringement verdict.\u201d XY, LLC v. \nTrans Ova Genetics, L.C ., 890 F.3d 1282, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  \u201cGenerally, the jury\u2019s damages \naward is a starting point for evaluating ongoing royalties.\u201d Apple, Inc. , 2014 WL 6687122, at *14 \n(citing Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. v. W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc. , 670 F.3d 1171, 1193 (Fed. \nCir. 2012), vacated on other grounds , 467 F. App\u2019x 747.  In addition, the Court may consider the \nGeorgia-Pacific  factors. Arctic Cat Inc. v. Bombardier Recreational Prods. Inc ., 876 F.3d 1350, \n1370 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (citing Georgia\u2013Pac. Corp. v. U.S. Plywood Corp. , 318 F. Supp. 1116, 1120 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1970)). \nThe jury awarded Plaintiffs a royalty of 7% for sales of DNA-related products in the United \nStates and used 7% to calculate damages for the infr ingement that led to sale of products abroad.  \nWith respect to the DNA-related products, Plaintiffs  argue that, post-verdict, the royalty should be \nenhanced because \u201c(1) the signi ficant value of additi onal consideration paid by Archer to \nMGH . . .; (2) the vast difference in the stages of the technology . . .; and (3) the jury\u2019s finding that \nQiagen willfully infringe d.\u201d (D.I. 496 at 16-17).  In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the following \nGeorgia-Pacific  factors weigh in favor of enhancement: \u201cArcher\u2019s unwillingness to license the 32 Infringed Patents (Factor 4); th e parties\u2019 post-verdict commercial relationship (Factor 5); the \nprofitability and commercial succ ess of the products using the pa tented technology (Factors 8, 11); \nthe benefits of the Infringed pa tents (Factors 9, 10); and the contribution of th e patented features \nto the overall product (Factor 13).\u201d  ( Id.).   \nThe Court is not persuaded that the factors Plaintiffs  point to indicate that they would be \nable to secure a higher royalty rate than the rate de termined by the jury.  First, the jury considered \nall of the factors noted by Plaintiffs in making its royalt y determination.  ( See D.I. 462 at 49, D.I. \n496, Ex. E \u204b\u204b 28-32).  At trial, Plaintiffs\u2019 expert argued that these exact factors were why the jury \nshould enhance the 4.5% rate (pro vided as a starting point based on the Archer/MGH license) to \n7%.  ( See D.I. 496, Ex. E \u204b\u204b 28-32.). The jury awarded Plaintiffs  7% and thus appears to have \ntaken these factors into account.  Although Plain tiff would be in a stronger bargaining position \npost-verdict11, Plaintiffs point to no other circumstances  that indicate they would be able to \nnegotiate a rate higher than  the already-enhanced rate determined by the jury.  \nWith respect to the RNA-relate d products, Plaintiffs argue that  the jury\u2019s award of a 7% \nroyalty rate should be enhanced to 15.5% gi ven the jury\u2019s award of lost profits.  ( See D.I. 496 at \n17-18).  Plaintiffs, however, cite to no law that indi cates an award of lost pr ofits requires the Court \nto enhance the royalty rate.  Plaintiffs point to no  other factors other than the lost profits award to \n \n11  The Federal Circuit has stated that in determining an ongoing r oyalty rate, \u201c[o]nce a \njudgment of validity and infringement has been entered . . . the calculus is markedly \ndifferent [from the jury\u2019s calculus] because  different economic factors are involved.\u201d \nAmado v. Microsoft Corp. , 517 F.3d 1353, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  As other courts have \nnoted, however, the logic behind th is view in unclear given that the jury is required to \naward a rate negotiated by will ing licensors and licensees who considered the patent(s) \nvalid and infringed.  See, e.g. , Vectura Ltd. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC , No. CV 16-638-RGA, \n2019 WL 4346502, at *7 n. 10 (D . Del. Sept. 12, 2019); see also Apple, Inc. v. Samsung \nElecs. Co. , No. 12-CV-00630-LHK, 2014 WL 6687122, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 25, 2014).   \n 33 support their contention that the rate  should be higher than 7%.  Th erefore, the Court sees no reason \nto disturb the jury\u2019s finding.  \nThe Court will thus grant Plaintiffs\u2019 request  for ongoing royalties at a 7% rate for both \nRNA- and DNA-related products.  \n3. Enhanced Damages  \nPlaintiffs request th at the Court award enhanced dama ges under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284.  (D.I. \n496 at 20).  Whether to award enhanced dama ges is committed to the Court\u2019s discretion. Halo \nElecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc. , 579 U.S. 93, 103 (2016).  Enhanced  damages are \u201cd esigned as a \n\u2018punitive\u2019 or \u2018vindictive\u2019 sanction\u201d  that is \u201cgenerally reserved for egregious  cases of culpable \nbehavior.\u201d  Id.  at 103-04.  \u201cThe sort of conduct warrant ing enhanced damages has been variously \ndescribed in our cases as will ful, wanton, malicious, bad-faith, deliberate, consciously wrongful, \nflagrant, or \u2013 indeed \u2013 char acteristic of a pirate.\u201d  Id.  Enhanced damages should not be awarded \nin \u201cgarden-variety cases.\u201d  Id. at 109.  \u201cA jury\u2019s finding of willful infringement is a prerequisite to \nenhancement of damages but is not by itself sufficient.\u201d   Nox Med. Ehf v. Natus Neurology Inc. , \nNo. 1:15-CV-00709-RGA, 2018 WL 6427686, at *1 (D. Del. Dec. 7, 2018) (citing Halo , 579 U.S. \nat 103-04).  \nAs an initial matter, the C ourt does not find that this cas e involves conduct suggesting \nwillful, wanton, malicious or other nefarious behavior on the part of  Defendants.  Plaintiffs sued \nDefendants on the \u2019810 patent just one day after it issued in 2018 and they sued Defendants on the \n\u2019597 patent after this litigation had begun.  ( See D.I. 1, D.I. 130; see also  Tr. at 692:1-19).  This \nwas a hard-fought litigation and although Plaintiffs ul timately prevailed before  the jury, the issues \nwere close.  And indeed, Defenda nts prevailed at summary judgment as to literal infringement of \nthe \u2019810 patent.  ( See D.I. 447).  34 That being said, Plaintiffs argue that  applying the factors articulated in Read Corp. v. \nPortec, Inc. , 970 F.2d 816 (Fed. Cir. 1992) favors an aw ard of enhanced damages in the present \ncase.  Although not require d, courts may turn to the Read  factors to guide their analysis.  Presidio \nComponents, Inc. v. Am. Tech. Ceramics Corp. , 875 F.3d 1369, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  The Read  \nfactors are: \u201c(1) whether the in fringer deliberately copied the id eas or design of  another; (2) \nwhether the infringer, when he kn ew of the other\u2019s patent protecti on, investigated the scope of the \npatent and formed a good-faith beli ef that it was invalid or that it was not infring ed\u201d; (3) \u201cthe \ninfringer\u2019s behavior as a party to the litigation\u201d ; (4) \u201cdefendant\u2019s size and financial condition\u201d; (5) \n\u201ccloseness of the case\u201d; (6) \u201cd uration of defendan t\u2019s misconduct\u201d; (7) \u201cr emedial action by the \ndefendant\u201d; (8) \u201cdefendant\u2019s motivation for harm \u201d; and (9) \u201cwhether de fendant attempted to \nconceal its misconduct.\u201d Liquid Dynamics Corp. v. Vaughan Co ., 449 F.3d 1209,1225 (Fed. Cir. \n2006) (citing Read , 970 F.2d at 826-27).   \nPlaintiffs primarily rely on th e first factor.  That is, \u201cDef endant had direct access to, and \ndeliberately copied, Plaintiffs  groundbreaking technology.\u201d  (D.I . 496 at 21).  The evidence \nPlaintiffs point to, however, is circumstantial at best and merely shows that Defendants had the \nopportunity to copy certain technology.  ( See. id.  at 22-24 (citing evidence that Defendants had \naccess to and tested Plaintiffs\u2019 t echnology)).  Therefore, this f actor is, at most, neutral.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the second factor wei ghs in favor of awarding enhanced damages \nbecause Qiagen knew of the patents and possible infringement yet \u201cignored these red flags.\u201d  ( See \nD.I. 496 at 24-25).  Defendants counter by pointi ng to testimony that those who reviewed the \npatents \u201cdid not believe [they] were infringed.\u201d  (D .I. 501 at 27).  In the face of conflicting \nevidence, the Court finds this factor neutral.  35 Regarding factors three, six, se ven, eight and nine, Pl aintiffs fail to cite any evidence of \n\u201cegregious conduct\u201d on the part of Defendants that  rises to the level of  \u201cmalicious\u201d behavior \nrequired to support an award of enhanced damages.  These factors thus wei gh against Plaintiffs.  \nTurning to the fourth factor, Pl aintiffs note that \u201c[t]rebling the jury\u2019s award is less than \n0.1% of Qiagen\u2019s 2020 net sales of $1.87 billion.\u201d (D.I. 496 at 27).  This factor thus weighs in \nfavor of enhancing damages.  See nCUBE Corp. v. SeaChange Int\u2019l, Inc. , 313 F. Supp. 2d 361, \n390 (D. Del. 2004), aff\u2019d , 436 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding th is factor to weigh in favor of \nenhanced damages because defendant would \u201cnot be  materially impacted by an award of enhanced \ndamages\u201d).  \nTurning to the fifth factor, as Defendants poi nt out, this was a close case.  Defendants \nsuccessfully argued for summary judgment that th e \u2019810 patent was not literally infringed.  ( See \nD.I. 447).  In addition, Defendants put forth valid  arguments regarding other infringement and \ninvalidity theories at trial.  This f actor weighs heavily against Plaintiffs.  \nIn sum, the fourth factor (defendant\u2019s size  and financial condition) is the only one that \nclearly weighs in favor of granting enhanced damages.  The fifth factor strongl y weighs against \nenhancing the damages and the ot hers are largely neut ral or unsupported by evidence.  Given the \nlack of evidence of any egregious  conduct on the part of Defendant s, the Court is not persuaded \nthat this is a case that wa rrants enhanced damages.  \n4. Supplemental Damages \nPlaintiffs request supp lemental damages for sales that occurred before the verdict but were \nnot reflected in the last accounti ng.  (D.I. 496 at 18).  At tria l, the parties presented damages \ncalculations through December 31, 2020. During the pret rial conference, the Court ruled that an \naccounting would be performed for damages incurre d between January 1, 2021 and the date of the \njury\u2019s verdict.  (D.I. 520 (Aug 16, 2021 Pretrial Conference Tr.) at 90).  Defendants produced the 36 required financial data on Sept ember 3, 2021 and October 22, 2021.  ( See D.I. 496 at 19).  Applying \nthe jury award to Qiagen\u2019s data, Plaintiffs re quest the following amounts: $308,395 as lost profits \nfor sales of infringing RNA-related products in the United States, $194,69012 as a reasonable \nroyalty on sales of infringing DNA-related products in the United States and $722,928 as a \nreasonable royalty for sales abroad.  ( Id.)  \nDefendants do not dispute this request nor the amounts.  ( See D.I. 501 at 21).  Therefore, \nthe Court will grant Plai ntiffs\u2019 request for supplemental damages.  \n5. Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest \nPlaintiffs request prejudgmen t interest of $225,296 for all damages th rough the date of \njudgment using the U.S. prime ra te.  (D.I. 496 at 19).  Defendant s do not contest the award of \nprejudgment interest or Plaintiffs\u2019 calculation. Rather, Defe ndants\u2019 request that the Court apply \nthe Treasury bill rate rather than prime rate.  ( See D.I. 501 at 21).  For the reasons set forth below, \nthe Court will grant Plaintiffs\u2019 re quest and apply the prime rate.  \nPrejudgment interest is awarded to restore a plaintiff to the position it would have been in \nhad there been no wrongdoing.  See General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp. , 461 U.S. 648, 655-56 \n(1983); see also Delaware River & Bay Auth. v. Kopacz , 584 F.3d 622, 634 (3d Cir. 2009) \n(prejudgment interest awards \u201cmust be compensatory rather than punitive\u201d).  \u201cThe matter of prejudgment interest is left to the discretion of the di strict court.\u201d  Taxman v. Bd. of Educ. of Twp. \nof Piscataway , 91 F.3d 1547, 1566 (3d Cir. 1996).  This broa d discretion, of cour se, extends to a \ndetermination of the appropriate interest rate to apply.  See, e.g. , Sun Ship, Inc. v. Matson \nNavigation Co. , 785 F.2d 59, 63 (3d Cir. 1986) (\u201cIn federal question cases, the rate of prejudgment \n \n12  Plaintiffs use what parties agree was th e jury\u2019s intended roya lty of $752,006. (D.I. 496, \nEx. E \u204b 15).  37 interest is committed to the discretion of the district court.\u201d); Uniroyal, Inc. v. Rudkin-Wiley Corp. , \n939 F.2d 1540, 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1991). \nThe Court will assess prejudgment interest  compounded quarterly at the prime rate.  See, \ne.g., In re Frescati Shipping Co. , 886 F.3d 291, 315 (3d Cir. 2018) (district court within its \ndiscretion to award preju dgment interest either at the prime rate or post-judgment rate prescribed \nby 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a)); see also  Taxman , 91 F.3d at 1566 (\u201cThe adjusted  prime rate, established \nperiodically by the Secretary of  the Treasury and codified in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6621, has been used \nregularly by district courts to calculate prejudgment interest.\u201d); see also  Amgen Inc. v. Hospira, \nInc., 336 F. Supp. 3d 333, 364 (D. Del. 2018) (for pate nt damages, awarding prejudgment interest \nat the prime rate compounded quarterly), aff\u2019d , 944 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 20 19).  The prime rate is \nby far the most common practice in the District of Delaware.  See, e.g. , Bayer v. Baxalta , No. 16- \n1122-RGA, 2019 WL 4016235, at *7 (D. Del. Aug. 26, 2019); Idenix Pharm. LLC v. Gilead Scis., \nInc., 271 F. Supp. 3d 694, 705 (D. Del. 2017); Comcast IP Holdings I, LLC v. Sprint Commc\u2019ns \nCo., No. 12-0205-RGA, 2015 WL 4730899, at  *10 (D. Del. Aug. 10, 2015); Ateliers de la Haute-\nGaronne v. Broetje Automation-USA Inc. , 85 F. Supp. 3d 768, 783 (D. Del. 2015); Dow Chem. \nCo. v. Nova Chems. Corp. , No. 05-737-LPS, 2014 WL 1285508, at *11 (D. Del. Mar. 28, 2014); \nXpertUniverse, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc. , No. 09-157-RGA, 2013 WL 6118447, at *11 (D. Del. Nov. \n20, 2013). \nDefendants assert that the Court should apply the Treasury bill rate because Plaintiffs \u201chave \nnot put forward any eviden ce of its borrowing rates at  the relevant time.\u201d  (D.I. 501 at 21-22).  It \nis not necessary, however, for Plain tiffs to \u201cdemonstrate that it bor rowed at the prime rate in order \nto be entitled to prejudgment interest at that rate.\u201d  Baxalta , 2019 WL 4016235, at *7 (quoting \nUniroyal , 939 F.2d at 1545); see also  In re Frescati Shipping Co. , 886 F.3d at 314 (\u201c[H]ad the 38 District Court chosen to use the prime rate, it would not have a bused its discretion even without \nextensive proof of borrowing costs.\u201d); Idenix , 271 F. Supp. 3d at 705 (citing XpertUniverse , 2013 \nWL 6118447, at *11).  Therefore, the Court is not persuaded that the Treasury bill rate should be \napplied in this case.   \nIn sum, the judgment shall be amended to include prejudgment  interest compounded \nquarterly at the prime rate for the $841,756 in lost  profits in connection with Defendants\u2019 RNA-\nrelated products sold in  the Unites States, $752,00613 in royalties for sales of DNA-related products \nin the Unites States and $2,240,303 in  royalties for sales abroad.  \nIn addition, Plaintiffs request post-judgmen t interest in the amount of $10.14 per day.14  \nPost-judgment interest is mandatory for damages awarded in civil cases.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a) \n(\u201cInterest shall be allowed on any money judgment in  a civil case recovered in  a district court.\u201d).  \nConsistent with \u00a7 1961(a), the rate proposed by Plai ntiffs is the weekly average one-year constant \nmaturity Treasury yield for the w eek preceding entry of judgment ( i.e., 0.07%).  ( See D.I. 496 at \n20).  Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs are entitled to post-judg ment interest or that the rate \nused by Plaintiffs is proper.  Therefore, Plai ntiffs shall be awarde d post-judgment interest \ncalculated using that rate and starting from the date judgment on the jury ve rdict was entered ( i.e., \nAugust 27, 2021).  Post-judgment intere st shall be awarded for the entire amount in cluded in the \n \n13  Plaintiffs use what both parties agree was the jury\u2019s intended royalty of $752,006. ( See D.I. \n496, Ex. E \u204b\u204b18-20 (citing Schedule 4.1D)).  The Cour t will grant Defendants\u2019 remittitur \nregarding this award and thus uses the same amount in its award of pre- and post-judgment \ninterest.  \n \n14  Plaintiffs apply the weekly average one-year  constant maturity Treas ury yield for the week \npreceding entry of judgment, which was 0.07%. (D.I. 496 at 20). This corresponds to a daily interest rate of 0.00019% and results in $4.21 on damages for sales of infringing \nproducts sold to customers for use in the Un ited States and $5.93 on damages for sales of \ninfringing products sold to customers for use abroad. ( Id.).   39 judgment, including prejudgment interest.  See Skretvedt v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours , 372 F.3d \n193, 217 (3d Cir. 2004).  To be cl ear, however, post-judgment intere st on the prejudgment interest \naward does not begin to accrue un til the amended judgment quantify ing the prejudgment interest \nis entered.  See Travelers Cas. & Sur. C o. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. , 609 F.3d 143, 175 (3d Cir. 2010) \n(\u201c[P]ost-judgment interest on Trav elers\u2019 award of prejudgment inte rest did not begin to run until \nthe December 5, 2007 order was entered quantifying the amount in prejudgment interest owed to \nTravelers.\u201d).     \nIn sum, the Court will grant Plaintiffs\u2019 request for pre- and post-judgment interest.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants\u2019 renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or \nin the alternative, motion for a new trial or altered judgment (D .I. 495) is DENIED, Defendants\u2019 \nmotion for remittitur is GRANTE D, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for enha nced damages (D.I. 494) is \nDENIED, motion for an injunction is DENIED with leave to rene w after an evidentiary hearing, \nmotion for ongoing royalty is GRANTED-IN-PAR T, motion for supplem ental damages is \nGRANTED and motion for pre- and post-judgment interest is GR ANTED.  An appropriate order \nwill follow."}
