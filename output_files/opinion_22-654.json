Coleman (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), an inmate at the James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center (\u201cJTVCC\u201d) in Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.! (D.I. 3) He appears pro se and has been granted leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 5) Pending are numerous motions. (D.I. 5, 12,\n15, 21, 22, 24)\nIl BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff suffers from dry eyes and lagophthalmos, a condition which\nprevents him from fully closing his eyelids. (D.I. 3 at 6) Because he has\nsensitivity to light and pain due to the condition, he is prescribed solar shield\nglasses and pain medication. (Id. at 6-10) He has received treatment for the\nconditions at both Howard R. Young Correctional Institution and James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center.? (/d.) Pending are several motions including Plaintiffs\n\nmotion for injunctive relief, requests for counsel, motion for discovery, motions for\n\n' When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a\nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See\nWest v. Atkins, 487 US. 42, 48 (1988).\n\n2 State Defendants Warden May and Michael Trader are sued in their official capacities. A\nservice order will issue this date. Medical Defendants William Ngwa, Jasvir Kaur, Shatyra\nHenderson-Hamwright, Feeah Steward, and Centurion have waived service of summons. (D.I.\n16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n\n1\n\nshow cause, and motion for a medical evaluation (D.I. 5, 15, 21, 24) and medical\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 22).\nIl. MOTION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nPlaintiff filed a motion for injunctive relief or, in the alternative, a request\nfor counsel a few days after he commenced this action. The motion does not\nspecifically request relief. Liberally construing the motion, it appears that due to\nhis medical condition Plaintiff seeks dimming of lights where he is housed, darker\nsolar shades, and effective pain medication. Defendants oppose the motion. (D.I.\n13, 14)\n\nA. Legal Standards\n\nA preliminary injunction is \u201can extraordinary remedy that should be granted\nonly if: (1) the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) denial will result in\nirreparable harm to the plaintiff; (3) granting the injunction will not result in\nirreparable harm to the defendant; and (4) granting the injunction is in the public\ninterest.\u201d NutraSweet Co. v. Vit-Mar Enterprises, Inc., 176 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir.\n1999) (\u201cNutraSweet II\u201d). The elements also apply to temporary restraining orders.\nSee NutriSweet Co. v. Vit-Mar Enterprises., Inc., 112. F.3d 689, 693 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(\u201cNutraSweet I\u201d) (a temporary restraining order continued beyond the time\n\npermissible under Rule 65 must be treated as a preliminary injunction, and must\n\n3 Plaintiff's requests for counsel (D.I. 5, 15, 24) are discussed in Paragraph IV, supra.\n2\n\nconform to the standards applicable to preliminary injunctions). \u201c[F]ailure to\nestablish any element in [a plaintiff\u2019s] favor renders a preliminary injunction\ninappropriate.\u201d NutraSweet II, 176 F.3d at 153. Furthermore, because of the\nintractable problems of prison administration, a request for injunctive relief in the\nprison context must be viewed with considerable caution. Rush v. Correctional\nMed. Services, Inc., 287 F. App\u2019x 142, 144 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Goff'v. Harper,\n60 F.3d 518, 520 (8th Cir. 1995)).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nPlaintiff is housed in MHU where the lights are on daily from 7:00 a.m. to\n11:30 p.m. He contends that the constant, unobstructed lighting causes him to\nsuffer severe eye pain, headaches, and nausea. (D.I. 5 at 1) Plaintiff states that the\nState Defendants are aware of his medical condition. He has repeatedly requested\na medical memorandum to dim or extinguish the lights to no avail. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff also indicates that he is denied effective pain medication. (/d.)\nPlaintiff was seen by a pain specialist who ordered Tramadol twice a day and\nLyrica for optic nerve issues. (/d. at 2) Plaintiff states that Medical Defendants\ndisregarded and declined to follow the specialists\u2019 orders as they related to pain\nmedicine and darker sun shields. (/d. at 2)\n\nMedical Defendants respond that Plaintiff was issued a short-term\n\nprescription of Tramadol, advised of the negative long term effects of the\n\n3\nmedication and, when the prescription ran out, Plaintiff was given other pain\nmedication that was less addictive and contained less side effects. (D.I. 13 at 20)\nPlaintiff indicated that the substitute medication caused side effects, but he refused\ndiagnostic tests to confirm this. (Id.) Medical Defendants dispute Plaintiff's\nstatement that they did not accept the recommendation of darker solar shields for\nPlaintiff. (Id.) Medical Defendants state that a medical memorandum was issued\nin June 3, 2022 to obtain approval for darker shaded glasses, and new glasses have\nyet to be approved. (Jd. at 3 n.1) Medical Defendants further state that a medical\nmemorandum was issued that requested Plaintiff's housing in an area with less\nbright lights or lights outside of the cell that could be dimmed. (Id. at 3)\nAccording to Medical Defendants, housing is a security issue left to the\nDepartment of Correction and \u201capparently the request was rejected.\u201d Id.) Medical\nDefendants state that Plaintiff refuses to take prescribed pain medical, has refused\nto attend medical appointments, does not like the special shaded glasses he was\nissued, and has allowed other inmates to use the specialized glasses. (Id. at 3-4)\nWarden May states that Plaintiff's security classification is medium, he is\nhoused in MHU, and assigned to a lower bunk. (D.I. 14 at 3) In MHU, cell and\ntier lights are illuminated between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. (dd. at 3). In those\nareas of the prison with inmate access to light switches, the lights are on from 6:00\n\na.m. to 11:00 p.m. (Id. at 4) The DOC has taken steps to prevent or minimize pain\n4\n\nby reassigning Plaintiff to a bottom bunk and permitting him to wear solar shields\nindoors. (/d. at 5) Plaintiff does not have a medical memorandum directing that\nthe lights in his cell be dimmed or extinguished. (/d.)\n\nThe record reflects that MHU is controlled by security personnel and its\nlighting systems are designed to provide a safe and secure environment. Here, the\nDOC has made accommodations for Plaintiff's medical condition that include a\nbottom bunk assignment and the use of solar shields.\n\nThe record also reflects that Plaintiff receives, and continues to receive,\ntreatment for his medical condition. He does not, however, agree with that\ntreatment and seeks medication that he prefers. It is well established that \u201ca\nprisoner has no right to choose a specific form of medical treatment,\u201d so long as\nthe treatment provided is reasonable. Lasko v. Watts, 373 F. App\u2019x 196, 203 (3d\nCir. 2010) (quoting Harrison v. Barkley, 219 F.3d 132, 138-140 (2d Cir. 2000))\nAn inmate\u2019s claims against members of a prison medical department are not viable\nunder \u00a7 1983 where the inmate receives continuing care, but believes that more\nshould be done by way of diagnosis and treatment and maintains that options\navailable to medical personnel were not pursued on the inmate\u2019s behalf. Estelle v.\n\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 107 (1976).\n\nGiven the record evidence, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met his\nburden for injunctive relief. More particularly, he has failed to show that he is\nlikely to succeed on the merits or that denial of his motion will result in his\nirreparable harm. Therefore, the motion for injunctive relief will be denied. (D.I.\n5) Plaintiffs motion for limited discovery with regard to the motion for injunctive\nrelief will be denied as moot. (D.I. 15)\n\nIV. REQUEST FOR COUNSEL\n\nPlaintiff appears pro se and was granted permission to proceed in forma\npauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. He requests counsel for the limited\npurpose of determining whether there is a meritorious basis for Plaintiffs motion\nfor injunctive relief (D.I. 5) and for the limited purpose of assisting with the\nmotion for injunctive relief (D.I. 15, 24).\n\nA pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or\nstatutory right to representation by counsel.* See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d\n187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nHowever, representation by counsel may be appropriate under certain\n\n4See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989)\n(\u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7 1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling attorney\nto represent an indigent civil litigant, the operative word in the statute being \u201crequest.\u201d).\n\n6\n\ncircumstances, after a finding that a plaintiffs claim has arguable merit in fact and\nlaw. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155,\n\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of\nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court\nin deciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include:\n(1) the merits of the plaintiffs claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her\ncase considering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed\nupon him or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the\ndegree to which factual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue\nsuch investigation; (5) the plaintiffs capacity to retain counsel on his or her own\nbehalf; and (6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or\nexpert testimony. See Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir.\n2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155-56. The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor\ndeterminative. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.\n\nAssuming, solely for the purpose of deciding this motion, that Plaintiff's\nclaims have merit in fact and law, several of the Tabron factors militate against\ngranting his requests for counsel and, particularly, that he requests counsel to assist\nwith his motion for injunctive relief. As discussed above, the motion will be\ndenied. Accordingly, Plaintiff's requests for counsel will be denied without\n\nprejudice as moot. (D.1.5, 15, 24)\nVv. MOTIONS FOR ORDERS TO SHOW CAUSE\n\nPlaintiff has filed two motions for the Court to enter orders to show cause.\nThe first, to show cause or evaluate Plaintiffs medical treatment. (D.I.21) In\nessence, Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief. The second, to show cause why Plaintiff\nis not receiving medical treatment. Again, Plaintiff appears to seek injunctive\nrelief.\n\nAt this juncture, the Court declines to issue show cause orders and will deny\nthe motions. (D.I. 21, 24) As previously discussed, the record indicates that\nPlaintiff receives medical treatment, albeit not to his liking.\n\nVI. MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nPlaintiff will be ordered to file a response to Medical Defendants motion to\ndismiss. (D.I. 22)\n\nVIL. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiff's motion for\ninjunctive relief (D.I. 5); (2) deny without prejudice as moot Plaintiff's requests for\ncounsel (D.I. 5, 15, 24); (3) deny as moot Medical Defendants motion for an\nextension of time (D.I. 12); (4) deny as moot Plaintiff's motion for discovery (D.I.\n15); and (5) deny Plaintiff's motion for a medical evaluation and for orders to\nshow cause (D.I. 21, 24),\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\n8\n\n"}
