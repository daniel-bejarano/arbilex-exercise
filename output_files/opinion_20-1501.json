Procedural Backgro und  2 \n Plaintiff  filed its  original  Complaint on November 6, 2020.  (D.I. 1)  On March 4, 2021, \nUnited States District Judge Maryellen Noreika referred the case to  the Court to hear and resolve \nall pre -trial matters up to and including expert discovery matte rs.  (Docket Item, March 4, 2021)1   \nThe instant Motion was filed on March 29, 2021, (D.I. 17), and b riefing w as completed \non May 10, 2021, (D.I. 35 ).  The Court heard oral argument on the Motion on October 15, 2021.  \n(See Transcript of October 15, 2021 He aring, or \u201cTr.\u201d)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nWhen presented with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a \ncourt conducts a two -part analysis.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. \n2009).  First, the court separates the fact ual and legal elements of a claim, accepting all of the \ncomplaint\u2019s well- pleaded facts as true, but disregarding any legal conclusions.  Id.  at 210- 11.  \nSecond, the court determines whether the facts alleged in the comp laint are sufficient to show \nthat the  plaintiff has a \u201c\u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d  Id.  at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 679 (2009)).  \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  In assessing the plausibility of a claim, the court \nmust \u201c\u2018accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine  whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff \nmay be entitled to relief.\u2019\u201d  Fowler , 578 F.3d at 210 (quoting Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny , 515 \nF.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008)).   \n \n1  The case was later reassigned to United States District Judge Richard G. \nAndrews.  (Docket Item, September 29, 2021)   3 \n Here, though, Defendant is using the Motion to assert  an affirmative defense\u2014i.e., that \nthe asserted patents are subject matter ineligible u nder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (\u201cSection 101\u201d) .  \u201cIn that \nscenario, d ismissal is permitted only if the well -pleaded allegations in the [c] omplaint, construed \nin the light most fav orable to the plaintiff, suffice to establish the defense.\u201d   M2M Sols. LLC v. \nAmazon.com, Inc ., Civil Action No. 17- 202-LPS-CJB, 2017 WL 6294874, at *2 (D. Del. Dec. \n11, 2017)  (citing cases) . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nWith its Motion, Defendant argues that the FAC  should be dismissed because  all four \npatents -in-suit fail to claim patent- eligible subje ct matter pursuant to Section 101.  The parties \naddressed the arguments for eligibility of the '395 patent  and the '453 patent  together, as the two \npatents are part of t he same patent family and share a common specification .  (D.I. 26 at 3 n.2; \nTr. at 6 )  Defendant refers to these two patents as the \u201cContact List Patents\u201d and the Court will  \nalso do so here, solely for efficiency\u2019s sake.  The parties additionally addressed  the arguments \nfor eligibility of the '135 patent  and the '179 patent  together , as th e two are also part of the same \npatent family and share a common specification .  (Id.)  Defendant refers to these two patents as \nthe \u201cEvent Notification Patents\u201d; the Cour t will too, again, simply to s ave time.2   \nBelow, after making r eference to the relevant legal standards , the Court will  first analyze \nthe Motion as to the Contact List Patents .  Then it will take up the Motion as it relates to the \nEvent Notification Paten ts.      \nA. Legal Standard  \n \n2  In adopti ng these shorthand na mes for t he respective sets of patents, the Court is \nnot meaning to make any statement about what the pa tents are directed to; it is solely doing so \nfor convenience.  (Tr. at 42)  4 \n As was noted above, the instant Rule 12(b)(6) Motion is premised on the assertion that \nthe patent claim s-in-suit are directed to patent -ineligible subject matter.  The Court has often set \nout the relevant legal standards for review of such a motion, including in Genedics, LLC v. Meta \nCo., Civil Action No. 17- 1062- CJB, 2018 WL 3991474, at *2- 5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2018).  It \nhereby incorporates by reference its discussion in Genedics  of these relevant legal standards , and \nit will follow this legal guidance in a ssessing the Motion. \nB. The '395 Patent and the '453 Patent  (the Contact List Patents)  \nThe ' 395 patent is entitled \u201c Contact List Display System and Method\u201d  and the '453 patent \nis entitled \u201c Contact List Aggregation and Display.\u201d   ('395 patent  at 1; '453 patent  at 1)3  \nGenerally speaking, they relate to systems and methods of contact list aggregation across \ncomputer networks.  Defendant assert s that claim 7 of the '395 patent (\u201cclai m 7\u201d) is \nrepresentative of the asserted claims of these t wo patents , (D.I . 18 at 3) ; claim 7  recites the \nfollowing:  \n7.  A method comprising:  \n \njoining a high level network;  \n joining a first low level network associated with a first messaging \nservice provider and a second low level network associated with a \nsecond  messaging servi ce provider;  \n \nobtaining a first contact list associated with the first messaging \nservice provider;  \n \nobtaining a second contact list associated with the second \nmessaging service provider;   \n \n3  All four patents -in-suit are attached as exhibits to t he FAC.  (D.I. 14 , exs. 1-4)  \nHerein, the Court will cite to the patents by their patent number.  Unless otherwise noted, for the \nContact List Patents, the Court will cite to the '395 patent \u2019s specification, and for the Event \nNotification Patents, it will cite to the '135 pat ent\u2019s spe cification.    \n 5 \n maintaining an aggregated contact that comprises the first contact \nlist and the second contact list ;  \n logging into the high level network;  \n displaying the aggregated contact list.  \n ('395 patent , cols. 13: 11-14:4)    \nIn its briefing, when discussing the claims of the Contact List Patents, Plaintiff also \nreference d claim 7 .  (D.I. 26 at 17)  However, Plaintiff  also made substantive reference to claims \n1 and 4 of the '395 patent  (\u201cclaim 1\u201d and \u201cclaim 4\u201d) .  (Id. at 15-16 & nn.7- 9; see also  Tr. at 51)\n4  \nAs a result, below the Court will assess the eligibility of  claims 1, 4 and 7 (t ogether, the \n\u201crepresentative claims\u201d) .  See Berkheimer v. HP Inc. , 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  \nClaims 1 and 4, for their part,  recite:  \n1. A system comprising:  \n \na network login engine;  \n a network contacts database embodied in one or more non-\ntransitory computer readable mediums;  \n \na web server coupled to the networks conta cts database;  \n \na contact aggregation engine coupled to the network login engine and the network contacts database;  \n wherein, in operation, the contact aggrega tion engine:  \n \ncontrols the network login engine to login or facilitate login to a \nfirst network a ssociated with a first messaging service provider and \na second network associated with a second messaging service provider,  \n \n \n4  In footnotes in its answering brief, Plaintiff additionally made mention of claims 1 \nand 4 of the '453 patent , though it did so in a manner suggesting that the arguments for eligibility \nas to those claims wer e no diff erent than t hey were a s to claims 1 and  4 of the '395 patent .  (D.I. \n26 at 16 nn.7- 9)  Therefore, the Court will not separately address claims 1 and 4 of the '453 \npatent  herein.  6 \n updates the networks contacts dat abase with contact information \nobtained from the first messaging service provider and the second \nmessaging service provider,  \n maintains an aggregated contact list that comprises a first contact list associated with the contact information from the first messaging service provider and a second contact list associated \nwith the contact information from the second messaging service provider,  \n stores the aggregated contact list in a non -transitory computer \nreadable medium at the web server, and  \n provides the a ggregated contact list to a display device. . . .  \n 4.  The system of claim 1 , further comprising a user profile \ndatabase, embodied in a non- transitory computer readable medium \nand coupled to the network login engine, where , in operation, the \nuser profile database includes a user -specific information that the \nnetwork login engine uses to login or facilitate login to the one or more networks.  \n \n('395 patent , cols. 12:36- 58, 13: 1-6). \n 1. Alice \u2019s Step One  \nThe Court first assesses Alice \u2019s step one, which asks whether the claim s at issue are \n\u201cdirected to\u201d an abstract idea.  What is an abstract idea?  It can be (but is not necessarily limited \nto) a \u201cpreexisting, fundamental truth\u201d that \u201cexis[ts] in principle a part from any human action[,]\u201d \nor a \u201cmethod of organizing human activity\u201d (such as a \u201clongstanding commercial \npractice\u201d).   Alice  Corp. Pty.  Ltd. v.  CLS  Bank  Int\u2019l , 573 U.S.  208, 220 (2014)  (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted); see also DDR  Holdings, LLC  v. Hotels.com, L.P. , 773 F.3d 1245, \n1256- 57 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  A claim to an abstract idea has been described by the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as one  directed to a \u201c\u2018disembodied\u2019 concept . . . a basic \nbuilding block of human ingenuity, untethered from any real -world applicati on.\u201d  CLS  Bank  Int\u2019l \nv. Alice  Corp. Pty.  Ltd., 717 F.3d 1269, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (Lourie, J., concurring) (citation 7 \n omitted).  Beyond that, the \u201c abstract  ideas \u201d category has not been crisply  defined , see Alice , 573 \nU.S. at 221 (declining to \u201clabor to de limit the precise contours of the \u2018 abstract  ideas \u2019 category\u201d), \nand the Supreme Court of the United States and the Federal Circuit have found it sufficient to \ncompare claims at issue to those claims already found to be directed to an  abstract  idea in \nprevious cases,  see Enfish LLC v. Microsoft Corp. , 822 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2016) . \nDefendant  argues  that the representativ e claims of the Contact List Patents are directed to \nthe abstract idea of  \u201caggregating contact lists[.]\u201d  (D.I. 18 at 3, 7)  Is \u201caggre gating contact lists\u201d \nan abstract idea?  It seems undisputed that it is.  In that regard, Defendant notes that \u201caggregating \ncontact lists\u201d is \u201can age- old human endeavor\u201d that is practiced, for example, whe n:  (1) different \ndepartments at  an institution maintain their own separate  contact lists in different forms; and  then  \n(2) an  administrator tasked with creating a n institution -wide contact list \u201creformat[s]\u201d those  \nseparate lists by \u201ccreating a common format\u201d  for the institution -wide  list.  (Id. at 9; Tr. a t 9-10); \ncf. Voter Verified, Inc. v. Election Sys. & Software LLC , 887 F.3d 1376, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2018) \n(concluding that a concept amounted to an abstract idea whe re \u201c[h]umans have performed this \nfundamental activity . . . for hundreds of years\u201d).  And Pla intiff did not contest that \u201caggregating \ncontact lists\u201d is an abstract idea.   (Tr. at 45)  \nPlaintiff does , however, argue that the claims are not actually \u201cdirected to\u201d this abstract \nidea.5  (Id.; see also  Plaintiff\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 11)  Instea d, it a sserts that Defendant  \n\u201covergeneralizes the claims\u201d at too high a level of abstraction.   (D.I. 26 at 10)    \n \n5  In Alice \u2019s first step, the \u201c\u2018directed to\u2019 inquiry applies a stage -one filte r to clai ms, \nconsider ed in light of the  specification, based on whether \u2018 their character as a whole \u2019\u201d or their \n\u201cfocus\u201d is directed to excluded subject matter.  Enfish , 822 F.3d at 1335- 36 (quoting Internet \nPatents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc., 790 F.3d 13 43, 1346 ( Fed. Cir. 2015)) (emphasis ad ded).   8 \n So are  the representative claims actually \u201cdirected to\u201d the concept of \u201caggregating \ncontact lists\u201d?  They do seem to be focused on t hat broad i dea (a t least as applied to  the instant \nmessaging service context ).6  Those claims  all appear to be written in a way that highlights the \nimportance of such aggregation, and they all seem to naturally build toward the aggregation step .  \nPut differently, t he wording of independent c laims 1 and 7 seem to be largely about:   (1) \nobtaining a first contact list associated with a first  instant messaging provider; (2) obtaining a \nsecond contact list associated with a second instant messaging provider;  (3) \u201cmaintain[ ing]\u201d an \naggregated contact list  that comprises both the first and second contact list s (and, relatedly, \ndisplaying that aggregated contact list ).  (Tr. at 20)  Moreover, t he claims do not seem to be \ndirected to any more specific way of aggregating the cont acts at issue, as they do not describe the \ndetails of the aggregation process at all.   \nThe Court next consults the common specification.7  In that regard, it is worth noting tha t \nthese patents do not provide a lot of explanation about the particular probl em that the y are meant \n \n6  The Court acknowledges that, given the Contact List Patents\u2019 focus on instant \nmessaging s ervices in particular, it seems somewhat facile to say that the claims are directed \nsimply to the concept of  \u201caggregating cont act lists\u201d without also giving some nod to the instant \nmessaging service context .  But even if the concept were framed as \u201caggregating contact lists of \ninstant messaging s ervices ,\u201d that would still amount to an abstract idea.  A nd the rem ainder of  \nthe anal ysis below woul d not meaningfully change.  (Tr. at 13- 15) \n \n7   In order to determine what a patent claim is really \u201cdirected to\u201d at step one, the \nFederal Circuit has encouraged district courts to consider the content of the pa tent\u2019s \nspeci fication.   Cf. Enf ish, 822 F.3d a t 1337 (indicating that it is appropriate to look to a patent\u2019s \nspecification to determine whether a claim of the patent is \u201cdirected to\u201d a particular concept, and \nthat if a claim contains a particular element tha t is descr ibed by t he patent \u2019s specification as what \nthe \u201cpresent invention comprises[,]\u201d this suggests that the claim may be directed to that element or concept) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ; Internet Patents Corp., 790 F.3d at \n1348 ( same, and noting that  if a con cept is descr ibed in the patent as being \u201cthe innovation over \nthe prior art\u201d or the \u201cessential, most important aspect\u201d of the patented invention, that suggests that the claim is directed to that concept) (internal quotation ma rks and citation omit ted). \n 9 \n to solve.  In  the \u201cBackground\u201d section  of the specification , the patents  do explain that in the \nrelevant time period, there were many popular instant messaging services on the public Internet, \nand that most of those services  include d contact lists \u2014i.e., information about whether people on \none\u2019s list of contacts were currently online and available to chat.  ( '395 patent, col. 1:25- 45)  \nThen , in the \u201cSummary\u201d section, the specification explains that exemplary embodiments of the \ninventi ons relate to a \u201ctechnique for contact list aggregation across a plurality of different \nnetworks [, which] involves logging into low level networks through a high level network[.]\u201d   \n(Id., col. 1:61- 63 (emphasis added) )8  The specification further explains t hat: \nIn operation, the system logs into one or more of the low level \nnetworks  (or facilitates login for a user).  The network contacts \ndatabase may include some information about contacts associated with the networks fr om, by way of example but not limitat ion, \nprevious logins or data explicitly entered by a user.  To the extent that the data in the network contacts database is not current, the contact aggregation engine updates the networks contacts database contact info rmation, then provides an aggregated contact list \nincluding the contact information to a display device.  A method according to the technique may include logging into a high level network and displaying contacts from the one or more low level networks in a n aggregated contact list.  The method may further \ninvolve logging into the one or more low level networks.  \n(Id., cols. 1:67- 2:15)   In reading this, it could be understood that t he patent\u2019s focus is on the \nreferenced \u201ctechnique\u201d \u2014a technique  that allows for \u201ccontact list aggregation a cross a plurality \nof networks.\u201d  In sum, t his all sounds like the patent is focused on the abstract idea at iss ue.\n9   \n \n8  The patents \u2019 Abstracts read very similarly, and they too acknowledge that the \npatents are about a \u201ctechnique for contact list aggregation across networks [that] involves logging into low level networks through a high level ne twork.\u201d  ( '395 patent  at 1; '453 pa tent at \n1) \n \n9 Additionally, the titles of the patents (\u201cContact List Aggregation and Display\u201d and \n\u201cContact List Display System and Method\u201d) do not describe a more narrow focus than what Defendant posits.  Instead, they suggest that a ggregating contact  lists (and displaying them, 10 \n   Plaintiff argues to the contrary that \u201c[w]hen viewed in their entirety, and in light of the \nspecification, the claims a re directed to s pecific, substantial improvements to messaging systems, \nincluding their effectiveness, functionality[] and utility.\u201d  (D.I. 26 at 10)   So what are the \npurported \u201csubstantial improvements to messaging systems\u201d that Plaintiff is saying these claims are direc ted to?   In its briefing, Plaintiff points to three such areas of improvement , noting that :   \n(1) \u201caggregation of contacts from a plurality of messaging systems \nwas unavailable and/or was cumbersome \u201d (i.e.,  because in \norder to create an aggregated contact lis t prior t o the invention, \na person would at best only have been able to manually copy or transfer contact files from one messaging service to another)  \nand \u201c prone to potential errors \u201d (i.e., because prior art efforts \nthat relied on manually inputting contac ts result ed in various \ninput errors);  \n \n(2) prior art messaging systems \u201clacked the ability to maintain a[n] . . . aggregated contact list[] across or between multiple user devices  and [were] su bject to compatibility problems\u201d ( i.e., \nbecause contact lists were typically maintained in a proprietary format by each messaging service, such that a contact list from \none service was not usable or accessible by another messaging service) ; and \n \n(3) the claims \u201cimprove the way messaging systems operate and handle data , including by a llowing . . . the aggregated contact \nlist to be consistently updated in real time across the user\u2019s devices, including from a network contacts database.\u201d   \n \n(D.I. 26 at 12- 13 (section of Plaintiff\u2019s Answering Brief titled \u201cThe '395 and '453 Claims  are \nDirected to Innovative Computer - and Network- Based Systems and Methods\u201d) (citing D.I. 14 at \n\u00b6\u00b6 38, 56))\n10  Yet Plaintiff\u2019s arguments here do not help it escape  the patents\u2019  step one problem.  \n \nwhich is probably inherent in the concept of aggregation), (Tr. at 19), is what the patents are about. \n \n10  In its answering brief, at the very end of the step one section regarding the \nContact List P atents, Pl aintiff m ade refer ence to clai m 1\u2019s inclusion of a \u201ccontact aggregation \nengine[,]\u201d a \u201cnetwork login engine[,]\u201d a \u201cweb server/server\u201d and a \u201cnetworks contact database.\u201d  (D.I. 26 at 14- 15 (internal quotation marks omitted))  But Plaintiff did not explain therein what 11 \n  Plaintiff\u2019s first \u201cdirected to\u201d argument \u2014that the claims are purporte dly about taking a \nmanual process for aggregating contact lists and making that process go faster or more efficiently \nvia computeriz ation \u2014is not helpful to it .  (D.I. 14 at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 51; id ., ex. 5 at \u00b6 44)   Even assuming \nthat the claims do require this type of automation, (Tr. at 83), t he Federal Circuit has explained \nthat where a patent \u2019s claims  simply seek to \u201cautomate  [a manual] methodolog[y] to conserve \nhuman resources and minimize errors [,]\u201d this demonstrates that  the patent at issue is a \n\u201cquint essential  \u2018do it on a computer\u2019 patent [.]\u201d  Univ. of Fla. Research Found., Inc. v. General \nElec. Co ., 916 F.3d 1363, 1367 (F ed. Cir. 2019).  I n such a scenario, the insubstantial nature of \nthe c omputer ization element in the claims only underscores that the  claims a re really directed to  \nthe well -known, longstanding abstract idea itself  (here, \u201caggregating contact lists\u201d) .  Id.; see also \nOrcinus Holdings, LLC v. Synchronoss Techs., Inc ., 379 F. Supp. 3d 857, 878 (N.D. Cal. 2019) \n(\u201cSo long as the underlying pr ocess claimed in the patent can be performed manually by a \nhuman, that is enough to find that a patent is directed toward an abstract idea. \u201d); (Tr. at 63 \n(Plaintiff\u2019s counsel acknowledging that this aspect of the claimed invention is akin to a \u201cdo it on a computer\u201d  patent)) . \n Plaintiff\u2019s second \u201cdirected to\u201d argument fares no better.  As it must at this stage , the \nCourt assumes that what Plaintiff alleges in its FAC is true:  that prior art efforts typically  ran \ninto problems with aggregating contact lists a cross mu ltiple user devices , since such list s were \noften maintained in a proprietary format by their  associated messaging service and could not \neasily be consolidated for that reason.  But then the question becomes:  Do the representative claims here requ ire that the first an d second contact lists at issue have formats that are \n \nthese t erms had to do wit h what claim 1 is directed to, and so the Court will not consider the \nargument further here.  12 \n incompatible  with each other?  Plaintiff has not explained (and the Court cannot see) why they \nnecessarily do.11  On their face, the claims simply appear to require that the two cont act lists  \ncome from two different \u201cmessaging service provider[s].\u201d  ( '395 patent, cols. 12:49- 55, 13: 14-\n20)  It would seem then that those respective contact lists could either be in compatible formats \nor incompatible formats.

In general, this is not a good approach.  In defending against a Section 101 motion at the \npleading stage, a patentee needs to make it clear i n some way how  claim construct ion w ould \nmake a d ifference in the Court\u2019s eligibility analysis.

(D.I. 26 at 15 -18)  Although these \naspects may invoke elements that were known in the  art, Pla intiff\u2019s argument is that, taken \ntogether,  the claims involve the non- conventional and non- generic arrangement of known, \nconventional pieces.  (D.I. 26 at 7, 9 (citing Bascom Global Internet Servs., Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341, 1350 ( Fed.

In the FAC  (which in turn often cites to an \nattached declaration of Plaintiff\u2019s expert , Dr. Rajeev Surati) , Plaintiff further alleges that storing \nsuch aggregated contact lists in \u201ca single network -based applic ation and/or  web service\u201d \namounte d to \u201c unconventional and inventive technological solutions  to [] technical problems that \nexisted at the time[.]\u201d  (D.I. 14 at \u00b6 77)13  By taking this approach, the FAC alleges that the \nContact List Patents \u201creduce[d] the use of the use r\u2019s computing device a nd resources thereon, \nincluding the use of the user\u2019s network traffic  \u2013 which [] was highly limited at the time of the \npatented inventions , especially on mobile networks  \u2013 because the user is not required to run \nmultiple ap plication s, including multiple lo cal applications, or access multiple web services \nsimultaneously.\u201d  ( Id.; see also  id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 42, 46, 49, 88; D.I. 26 at 17; Plaintiff\u2019s Hearing \nPresentation, Slide s 13-14, 16- 17; Tr. at 53- 54, 56 -57 (Plaintiff\u2019s counsel arg uing that  \u201cbeing \nable to use just  a single connection to obtain all of this aggregated information from the high[ -\n]level network was a technological solution to the problem that faced devices at that time which \nwas there may not be  bandwidth sufficient to m aintain connection to a pluralit y of different \nnetworks at once\u201d) )  This aspect of the invention allegedly also \u201creduce[d] the workload of \nclients and the servers of each individual instant messaging service by providing for various \ntasks to be run and ta ke place on the centralized inter mediary server.\u201d  ( D.I. 14 at \u00b6 89; see also  \nD.I. 26 at 17; Plaintiff\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 1 5) \n \n13  (See also  D.I. 26 at 3 (Plaintiff noting that  the \u201cunconventional\u201d  approach as  to \nthese patents  was going \u201c against the conventional method of locally storing the information\u201d and \ninstead \u201cstor[ing the contact lists] on a server for retrieval by the user\u201d))   16 \n Plaintiff also points to the fact that in claim 4, the system recited therein includes a \u201cuser  \nprofile database\u201d that i s \u201ccouple d to the network login e ngine\u201d and \u201cincludes [] user -specific \ninformation that the network login engine uses to login or facilitate login to the one or more \n[lower -level] networks.\u201d  ('395 patent, col. 13: 1-6)  In the FAC, the Plaintiff explains that the u se \nof this \u201cremote user profile database\u201d was \u201cunconventional and inventive\u201d because it \u201cpermitted user-specific information  . . . to be stored at the network or server to allow contact information to \nbe retrieved and an u p-to-date aggregate confl ict list [] be maintained, without requiring the user \nto enter such information each time they use the system.\u201d  (D.I. 14 at \u00b6 55; see also  Plaintiff\u2019s \nHearing Presentation, Slide 19)   The FAC notes that in \u201c2006, the convention wa s to not store \nsuch infor mation at  the server for the serv er to use upon a single login, [] due to security \nlimitations and privacy concerns[,]\u201d and instead to \u201clocalize[] storage of such information[.]\u201d  (D.I. 14 at \u00b6 55 ) \nIt appears to the Court that thes e purportedly unconventional aspects of the claims could \nmake a difference in the eligibility analysis.  Fo r example, the eligibility analysis is driven in \nsignificant part by \u201cthe concern . . . of pre -emption[,]\u201d Alice , 573 U.S. at 216, which in turn \ncompels a court to assess whether the clai ms at is sue \u201cattempt  to preem pt every application [or a \ngreat many applications]\u201d of the abstract idea at issue, DDR Holdings, LLC , 773 F.3d at  1259.  \nHere,  the pres ence of the above -referenced  limita tions in claims 1, 4 and 7 could demonstrate \nthat th ose claims wall off only a  narrow sub set of all inventions that  \u201caggregat[e]  contact lists\u201d of  \ninstant messaging service s.  Relatedly, f urther expert testimony about this subject (i.e., about the \nextent to which th ose claim limitations would or would not  preempt the relevant  field) appears \ncritical to a final assessment of eligibility.  And so, t his all augers in favor of denial of the \nMotion.     17 \n  During oral argument, when asked why such an  outcome would not  be the correct one, \nDefendant\u2019s counsel had two resp onses.  N either were persuasiv e.   \nFirst, Defendant\u2019s counsel argued that, at least as to claim 7, the claim does not require \nthat the \u201chigh level network\u201d on which the aggregated contacts lists are stored must be a non-\nlocal storage location (like a  remot e server).  (Tr. a t 85 (\u201cThere is  no distinction [in the claim] \nabout whether any of these networks are stored locally or on a server.\u201d))  But whether that is so would likely turn on what i s the appropriate claim construction for  \u201chigh level network.\u201d   \nPlaintiff argues that  when the  term is construed, it  will r equire that the aggregated contact lists be \nstored non- locally .  (Tr. at 92)   Based on the current record, the Court cannot say that Plaintiff\u2019s \nargument is  implausible .  Thus, the Court will adopt Pl aintiff\u2019s  proposed co nstructio n (requiring \nnon-local storage of the aggregated contact list on the \u201chigh level network\u201d)  solely for pur poses \nof resolving the Motion.  See Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank Nat. Ass\u2019n , 776 F.3d 1343, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (reviewi ng an eligibility decision at the pleading \nstage and adopting a construction most favorable to the patent ee (even one where there was some \nquestion as to the construction\u2019s merit), before going on to assess whether, even in li ght of that \nconstr uction, the claims could survive an Alice  analysis) .\n14   \nSecond, Defendant\u2019s  counsel argued that even \u201cif the Court w ere to assume the high level \nnetwork is stored on a server and the low level networks are stored locally . . . there [is] no discus sion of [ the benefits  of storage of the contact lists on a web server or a non- local high- level \nnetwork] in the patents [.]\u201d  (Tr. at 85)  C ounsel further asserted that such a process \u201cis still not \nunconventional\u201d  because \u201cusing . . . remote server s to do s omething t hat was oth erwise \n \n14  If the meaning of the term is still dis puted by then, the Cour t will tak e it up a t the \nMarkman hea ring in this case.   \n 18 \n performed locally\u201d is \u201cnot unconventional[.]\u201d   (Id. at 85 -86)  Defendant is correct that the pa tents \ndo not explicitly tout the benefits of non- local storage for the aggregated contact lists.  Yet that is \nof no moment he re, sinc e Plaintif f\u2019s FAC  does so in some detail.  In the FAC  (and in a n attached  \ndeclaration from Dr. Surati ), Plai ntiff includes facts indicating :  (1) the non- conventional nature \nof this method of storing aggregated contact lists  (as well as o f the use  of a user  profile  database) \nand (2) the related benefits.  The Court must presume the truth of those facts, and so this \nargume nt of Defendant\u2019s too must fail.  Cellspin , 927 F.3d at 1317.   \nTherefore, accept ing all of Plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations a s true, and const ruing the  FAC \nin the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court cannot say that the Motion is well taken as to \nthe Contact List Patents.  It thus recommend s that the Motion be denied at step two as to those \npatents.   \nC. The '135 Patent an d the '17 9 Patent  (the Event N otification Patents)  \nThe ' 135 pat ent and the ' 179 patent are both entitled \u201c Event Notification System and \nMethod.\u201d   ('135 patent at 1; ' 179 patent at 1)  Generally speaking, they relate to systems and \nmethods that modify a tit le associ ated with  a process, so as to include information about an event \nin that title.   Defendant assert s that claim 1 of the 135 patent (\u201cclai m 1\u201d) is representative, (D.I. \n18 at 5) ; claim 1 recites the following:   \n1.  A method comprising:  \n \nreceiving i nformatio n of an e vent that ca lls for user notification;  \n generating an event notification for the event;   associating the event notification with at least one of the plurality of character strings in a title array  that includes a plurality of \ncharacter s trings f or provis ioning for d isplay in a titlebar or taskbar \nof a display device;   19 \n providing the at least one of the plurality of character strings in the \ntitle array to a process executed by a processor;   providi ng an alternative title based on the at l east one of the \nplurality of character strings to the process;  \n using the alternative title as a title in association with the process.  \n ('135 patent , col. 12:42- 56) \n In light of the Court\u2019s decision below (recomme nding denial of the Motion), the Court \nneed not f ocus on a ny cl aim oth er than claim 1.  Put differently, in determining that the Court \ncannot now find claim 1 patent ineligible as a matter of law, the Court is necessarily also \ndetermining that it cannot find the remaining claims of the Event Not ification  Patents  ineligible \nat the pleading stage.\n15 \n The Court\u2019s analysis here need not progress past Alice \u2019s first step.   With regard to this \nstep, Defendant repeatedly asserts that claim 1 is directed to the concept of \u201cevent notification.\u201d   \n(D.I. 18 at  8 (empha sis omitte d); see als o D.I. 35 at 1)   Plaintiff does not dispute that \u201cevent \nnotification\u201d is an abstract idea; instead, Plaintiff argues that the claims are not \u201cdirected to\u201d that \nidea, and instead are directed to \u201csubstantial improvements in eve nt notification sys tems[.]\u201d  \n \n15  In the parties\u2019 briefing and at oral argument, they had a dispute about whether the \nCourt could assess eligibility as to certain claims of the Event Notification Patents th at Plaintiff \nhad not ye t affirmat ively ass erted  in the case (b ut as to which Plaintiff has reserved its right to \nassert at some later juncture in the case).  (D.I. 26 at 1; D.I. 35 at 4- 5; D.I. 65)  In light of the \nCourt\u2019s decision here, the Court need not  address this issue.  \n \nSimilarly, Plaintiff  argu ed that claim 1 was not representative of all of the claims of the \nEvent Notification Patents.  More specifically, Plaintiff argued that claim 11 of both patents (which purportedly contain means -plus-function elements) included ad ditional con tent that must  \nbe separatel y addressed .  (D.I. 26 at 10)  Again, because the Court herein concludes that the \nMotion is not well -taken as to claim 1, it need not address the arguments as to claim 11 of  both \npatents.  \n 20 \n (D.I. 26 at 18; see also  Plaintiff\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 23 (\u201c[Defendant] overgeneralizes \nthe claims, contenting they are merely directed to \u2018event notification.\u2019\u201d )) \n So what is claim 1 directed to?   The patents provide  real gui dance her e.  The \nspecifi cation explains that  for users of instant messaging services in  the relevant time  period, \nparticularly if they were at work, the users \u201cmay not want to play a noise or have a popup \nwindow show up every time a message is rec eived.\u201d  ( '135 pat ent, col. 5: 31-32)  Similarly, \u201ca \nuser who gets lots of messages may not want to hear the noise or see the popup windows because \nof the great frequency with which it occurs.\u201d   (Id., col. 5:33- 35)  The specification then explains \nthat \u201c[a] dvantageo usly, not ification ca n take place in a titlebar , which is great for devices that \nhave inferior notification functionality, and great for users who want a subtle notification.\u201d  ( Id., \ncol. 5:35- 38 (emphasis added) )  The patents also note that  some a lternative web cl ients have \n\u201cless control for alerts like flashing windows etc. from browsers\u201d and that in such cases, \u201cit may \nbe particularly advantageous for a server to be able to provide a user with alerts for new messages or events using the title ba r, task bar, or ot her display ar ea of a browser .\u201d  (Id., col. \n5:56- 62 (emphasis added))  R elatedly,  the specification  explains that the invention is meant  to \ncover a \u201ctechnique for user notification [that] involves modifying a title  associated with a proces s \nto inc lude infor mation about a n event that calls for user notification.\u201d  ( Id., col. 1:62- 64 \n(emphasis added) ) \n This focus \u2014on providing a notification about an event  in the  title bar/task bar  of a \ncomputerized  display \u2014is also emp hasized in claim 1.  Cla im 1 requ ires that  an \u201cevent \nnotification\u201d relating to an event is generated, and that the event notification is associated with \n\u201cat least one of the plurality of character strings in the title array \u201d for \u201cdisplay in a title bar or \ntaskbar of a display devi ce[.]\u201d  (Id., col. 12: 43-52 (emphasis added) )  It also states tha t \u201cat least 21 \n one of the plurality of character strings \u201d and \u201can alternative title based on at least one of the \nplurality of character strings\u201d are provided to a process  (e.g., an insta nt messag ing appli cation or \nbrowser), and that alternative title is used \u201cas a title in association with the process.\u201d  ( Id., col. \n12:50- 55)   \n To set out the above is to demonstrate why Defendant\u2019s Motion should fail at step one.  \nThe Supreme Court and the  Federal  Circuit ha ve clearly  warned that district court s must  be \ncareful not to oversimplify the claims or the claimed invention a t this step, since at some level, \nall inventions are based on or touch on abstract ideas.  See Alice, 573 U.S. at 217; In re  TLI \nCommc\u2019ns LLC P atent Litig ., 823 F.3d 607, 611 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  Yet this  is what Defendant \nhas done here  by asserting that the claim is directed to \u201cevent notification.\u201d16  As the above -\n \n16  In its opening brief, i n six di fferent i nstances, Defend ant asse rted that these claims \nwere directed to the concept of \u201cevent notification\u201d\u2014full stop.  (D.I. 18 at i, 7, 8, 9, 11)  \nDefendant even underlined the words \u201cevent notification\u201d  at times, in order to drive home  this \npoint.  (Id. at 8)  In its reply bri ef, Defendant again repeatedly referred to the abstract idea at \nissue as \u201cevent notification[.]\u201d  (D.I. 35 at i, 12)  That said, at one other point it its reply brief, Defendant sug gested that the abstr act idea at issue mig ht be  something a  bit more specif ic\u2014i.e.,  \nwhen it wrote that its \u201cformulation of the abstract idea\u201d was \u201cproviding an event notification in a title of a display, as an alternative to a non- event -based title ( i.e., displaying an alterna tive title o r \ntext fo r event notification.).\u201d  ( Id. at 12)  Ye t these two articulations of the purported abstract \nidea are not the same thing.  The former (\u201cevent notification\u201d) is clearly much broader than the latter.  In other words, in its opening brief , when it came time to dir ectly assert  what these clai ms \nare p urportedly directed to, Defendant made a conscious choice to frame that concept as \u201cevent \nnotification\u201d \u2014a concept that does  sound very broad and abstract.  It no doubt did s o for a reason.  \nHavi ng done so, it cannot  make ne w arguments about the \u201cdi rected t o\u201d step via its reply brief .  \nSee In re Horsehead Holding Corp. Secs. Litig., Civil Action No. 16- 292-LPS-CJB, 2018 WL \n4838234, at *17 (D. Del. Oc t. 4, 2018) (citing c ases) . \n During or al argument, whe n Defend ant\u2019s counsel again tried to frame the abs tract idea as \nsomething other than \u201cevent notification,\u201d the Court questioned counsel about the issue.  (Tr. at 26-28)  Defendant\u2019s  counsel then confirm ed that \u201cevent notifi catio n\u201d or  \u201cnotif ication of an \nevent\u201d was  the abstract concept that Defendant was a rguing the claims were directed to.  ( Id. at \n28)  But counsel then went on to suggest that providing notification of an event in a  titlebar or \ntaskbar i n a computer -related displ ay is nevert heless captured by the c oncept of \u201cevent \nnotification.\u201d  (Tr. at 28- 30)  Of course that is true, but it underscores why Defendant\u2019s step one \nargument is faulty.  As noted above, the Court must not  oversimplify a patent \u2019s claims in  the 22 \n referenced portions of the patents demonstrate, what claim 1 is r eally dir ected to i s not simply \n\u201cevent notification \u201d writ large, but to a more particular way  of notifying a computer user about \nan event \u2014i.e., by placing that notification in a display title in a titlebar or a task bar.  (D.I. 26 at \n19 (\u201c[T]he claims are not direc ted merel y to a metho d of providing generic or conventional event \nnotification to a user.\u201d))   Where t he event notification is placed is really what the patent is all \nabout \u2014and  it is the thing that is said to avoid some of the problems with prior a rt solutions (such \nas annoying noises or pop- up windows)  that the patentee was trying to overcome.  And y et this \nkey concept is not incorporated in D efendant\u2019s articulation of the abstract idea  at all . \n Because Defendant has not demonstrated that claim 1 is direct ed to the asserted a bstract \nidea at issue, its Motion as to the Event Notification Patents fails at step one. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that Defendant\u2019s Motion be DENIED.    \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursua nt to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636( b)(1)(B ), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.  The parties may serve and file specific written objections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2) .  The f ailure of  a pa rty to obj ect to l egal conclusions may result in the \n \nSection 101 an alysis.   And the concept  of \u201cev ent notification\u201d is so broad that it cou ld \nencapsulate myriad ways of alerting another to an event \u2014including doing so verbally in a \nconversation, or via a handwritten note , or by taking out a new spaper adv ertisemen t, or by \nputting up a sign on a ba rn, or by placing an advertisement in Times Squa re\u2014that are just \nfundamentally different concepts than what these particular patent claims are about (i.e., event \nnotification occurring via alternation of  a title in a taskb ar or titlebar in  a computer appl ication) .  \nDefendant\u2019s position here is akin to s aying that a patent claim describing the sending of a \nparticular type of encrypted e -mail is a claim that is directed to the abstra ct idea of \n\u201ccommunicat ing.\u201d  It is  both literall y correct as  a matter of wor dplay an d yet, from a \nlegal/Section 101 perspecti ve, demonstrably incorrect.  \n In short, Defendant tried to go very broad here in articulating the abstract idea at issue.  It \novershot.  And now it must l ive with the  conseque nces of th at deci sion. 23 \n loss of the right to de novo review in the district court.  See Sincavage v. Barnhart , 171 F.
