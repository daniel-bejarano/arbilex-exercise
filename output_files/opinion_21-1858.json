Civil Action No. 21-1858-CFC\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nee ee eee\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nIn 2018, a Delaware Superior Court jury found Petitioner Ryan Shover guilty of\nfirst degree murder, two counts of possession of a deadly weapon during the\ncommission of a felony, first degree conspiracy, and insurance fraud. (D.I. 1 at 2) The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed his convictions on May 21, 2019. See Shover v.\nState, 217 A.3d 1095 (Table), 2019 WL 2206270, at *1 (Del. May 21, 2019).\n\nOn December 30, 2021, Petitioner filed in this Court a Petition for Habeas\nCorpus Relief Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and a Memorandum in Support, which\nassert the following three grounds for relief: (1) \u201ctrial, appellate and collateral counsel\nabandoned his defense leaving him without counsel,\u201d in violation of United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984) ( D.I. 3 at 3); (2) all three attorneys failed to challenge his\nco-defendants cooperation agreements and how those agreements may have affected\n\nhis co-defendants\u2019 credibility (D.1.3 at 3-8); and (3) the State violated Brady v. Maryland,\n\n373 U.S. (1963) and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) by failing to obtain\nand disclose favorable impeachment evidence concerning the State\u2019s witnesses (D.I. 3\nat 10). Along with his Petition, Petitioner filed a Motion to Stay his habeas proceeding\nand a Motion to Appoint Counsel. (D.I. 4; D.I. 5) Petitioner requested a stay because\nhe had recently filed a post-conviction motion in the Delaware state courts seeking\nreconsideration of his \u201ctrial and collateral proceedings\u201d based on a recent Delaware\nSupreme Court decision in another case.\u201d (D.I. 4 at 1) The Court denied the Motion to\nStay because Petitioner did not provide enough information regarding the procedural\nposture of his state proceedings to determine if a stay would be appropriate. (D.I. 6 at\n2) In the same Order, the Court informed Petitioner of his rights under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2254 and directed Petitioner to file an AEDPA Election Form informing the Court how he\nwishes to proceed. (D.I. 6 at 1-2)\n\nPetitioner did not file a completed AEDPA Election Form. Instead, he filed\nanother Motion to Stay, asking the Court to stay his proceeding \u201cfor 60 days or until\nthere is clarification from the state courts on his collateral status and exhaustion.\u201d (D.I.\n7 at 2) The Court denied Petitioner's second Motion to Stay because he still had not\nprovided sufficient information supporting his request. (D.I. 8 at 2) The Court also\ndirected Petitioner to file a completed AEDPA Election Form. (/d.)\n\nIn response, on June 15, 2022, Petitioner filed: (1) a third Motion to Stay because\nthe State \u201crefuses to inform [him] of the status of his collateral proceedings\u201d and that his\nstate court records are sealed (D.I. 9 at 1); and (2) a completed AEDPA Election Form\n\nindicating his intent to amend the Petition to include all claims within thirty days (D.1.\n\n10). More than forty-five days have passed since Petitioner filed these two documents, =\n\nand he has not filed an amended Petition nor updated the Court on the status of his\n\nstate court collateral proceedings.\n\nA federal district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \u201cif it plainly\nappears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is\nnot entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. A petitioner is not entitled to\nfederal habeas relief unless he has exhausted state remedies for his habeas claims by\n\u201cfairly presenting\u201d the substance of the claims to the state\u2019s highest court, either on\ndirect appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, and in a procedural manner permitting\nthe state courts to consider the claims on the merits. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A);\nDuncan v. Henry, 513 U.S. 364, 365 (1995); Lambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513\n(3d Cir. 1997).\n\nBased on the foregoing summary of facts, it appears that Petitioner's motion for\nreconsideration is still pending before the Delaware state courts. Consequently, the\nCourt concludes that Petitioner has not yet exhausted state remedies for all of his\nfederal habeas claims. '\n\nAccordingly, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Petition without\nprejudice to provide Petitioner with an opportunity to finish exhausting his state court\nproceeding, and will dismiss as moot Petitioner's Motion to Appoint Counsel and his\nthird Motion to Stay. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability\n\u2018As a general rule, habeas petitions filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 must be filed\nwithin one year of the petitioner's judgment of conviction becoming final. See 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Petitioner is responsible for determining the events that trigger and toll\n\nthe limitations period.\n3\nbecause Petitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a\nconstitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. LA.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v.\nEyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nA separate Order follows.\n\nDated: August 9, 2022 CL. Z (4 ; Ly\nColm F. Connolly\n\nChief Judge\n"}
