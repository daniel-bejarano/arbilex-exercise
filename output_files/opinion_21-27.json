Westmoreland , Kate Talmor, and Jody \nLowenstein , U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE , Washington , DC \nAttorneys for Defendants \nFebruary 16, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION On May 17, 2021, the Acting Administrator of the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration (\"HRSA\") within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") \nsent a letter to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP (\"AstraZeneca \" or \"AZ\"). In the letter, HRSA \nnotified AstraZeneca of HRSA's conclusion that AstraZeneca has violated its obligations under \nthe federal 340B Program. In this Court, AstraZeneca challenges this \"Violation Letter,\" \narguing that the agency did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 701-06. AstraZeneca and the government have both moved for summary judgment on the \nadministrative record. \nAs the Court previously acknowledged (see D.I. 78 at 1), this case implicates a number of \nimportant issues of public policy, including funding for healthcare facilities across the country \nand access to care -especially for low-income individuals -at those facilities. As before, the \nCourt must set aside any personal views it may have on these matters and decide only the narrow \nquestion properly before it, which is now: did HRSA comply with the APA when it issued the \nViolation Letter? For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that HRSA did not. \nAccordingly , the Court will vacate and set aside the Violation Letter and remand to the \nagency for further consideration in light of the Court's opinion. The Court will also solicit the \nparties' views on the impact of the Court's conclusions on the claims for relief in AstraZeneca 's \nsecond amended complaint and whether (and, if so, how) this case should now proceed. \n1 BACKGROUND1 \nIn August 2020, AstraZeneca announced that, effective October 1 of that same year, it \nwould limit 340B pricing for covered outpatient drugs to drugs delivered to: (i) each covered \nentity's in-house pharmacy ; or (ii) a single contract pharmacy chosen by each covered entity, \nprovided that the covered entity does not have an in-house pharmacy. (See AR 7608-11 )2 \nIn response to AstraZeneca 's policy change, as well as similar policy changes by other \ndrug manufacturers and complaints from covered entities, on December 30, 2020 the general \ncounsel of HHS issued \"Advisory Opinion 20-06 on Contract Pharmacies Under the 340B \nProgram.\" (AR 8048-55) (\"Opinion\") In the Opinion, HHS mandated that drug manufacturers \nfacilitate sales of 340B drugs regardless of how covered entities distribute those drugs, writing: \n\"to the extent contract pharmacies are acting as agents of a covered entity, a drug manufacturer \nin the 340B Program is obligated to deliver its covered outpatient drugs to those contract \npharmacies and to charge the covered entity no more than the 340B ceiling price for those \ndrugs.\" (Id. at 8048) In particular , HHS took the view that all covered entities may use an \nunlimited number of contract pharmacies for dispensing 340B drugs. (See id. at 8055) \n1 In a prior memorandum opinion, the Court provided general background information \nregarding the 340B Program. See AstraZeneca Pharms. LP v. Becerra, 543 F. Supp. 3d 47, 50-\n53 (D. Del. 2021). The Court incorporates that background information by reference. \n2 As is typical in APA cases, the government was solely responsible for assembling and \nproviding the administrative record (\"AR\"). Given the size of this administrative record, the \nCourt permitted the government to file it manually. (See D.I. 88, 88-1, 89) The Court cites the \nadministrative record using the pagination provided in the bottom righthand comer of each page. \nFor example, \"AR 7608\" refers to the page marked \"VLTR_007608.\" \n2 According to the Opinion, these conclusions were mandated by the plain and unambiguous \nlanguage of the statute establishing the 340B Program. (See id. at 8049-50) \nShortly after HHS issued the Opinion, AstraZeneca filed suit in this Court. (D.I. 1)3 \nAstraZeneca then moved for summary judgment. (D.I. 42) In response, the government filed a \ncombined motion to dismiss and cross-motion for summary judgment. (D.I. 55) After \nexpedited proceedings, the Court issued a memorandum opinion regarding HHS 's Opinion and \nthe 340B statute. First, the Court explained how the Opinion differed in material ways from two \nguidance documents HRSA had issued in 1996 and 2010. See AstraZeneca , 543 F. Supp. 3d at \n54-57. Next, the Court held that the Opinion constituted final and reviewable agency action. \nSee id. at 57-58. For related reasons, the Court also held that AstraZeneca's challenge to the \nOpinion was timely. See id. at 58. Accordingly , the Court denied the government 's motion to \ndismiss, except with respect to one claim for relief AstraZeneca had abandoned. See id. at 58, \n62. \nOn the merits of AstraZeneca's claims, the Court concluded that the interpretation of the \n340B statute in the Opinion was not compelled by the unambiguous text of the statute, as HHS \nhad reasoned. See id. at 58-62. Rather, the 340B statute is \"silent as to the role that contract \npharmacies may play in connection with covered entities' purchases of 340B drugs.\" Id. at 59. \n3 Other drug manufacturers filed similar suits in other district courts. See Eli Lilly & Co. \nv. Cochran, No. 1 :21-cv-00081-SEB-MJD (S.D. Ind.); Sanofi-Aventis US., LLC v. US. Dep 't of \nHealth & Hum. Servs., No. 3:21-cv-00634-FLW-LHG (D.N.J.); Novo Nordisk Inc. v. US. Dep't \nof Health & Hum. Servs., No. 3:21-cv-00806-FLW-LHG (D.N.J.); Novartis Pharms. Corp. v. \nEspinosa, No. 21-cv-14979-DLF (D.D.C.); United Therapeutics Corp. v. Espinosa, No. 21-cv-\n1686-DLF (D.D.C.). A trade association representing multiple drug manufacturers, including \nAstraZeneca, brought another own suit against the government. See Pharm. Research & Mfrs. \nof Am. v. Cochran, No. 8:21-cv-99198-PWG (D. Md.). \n3 Analyzing the text and structure of the 340B statute and similar statutory provisions, the Court \nexplained that textual clues do not support the government 's reading of the 340B statute. See id. \nat 60. Moreover, the legislative history cuts against the government's position because \nCongress specifically did not enact statutory language referring to contract pharmacies. See id. \nat 60-61. Ultimately, the Court concluded that both sides' interpretations are permissible \nreadings of the 340B statute but that neither interpretation is compelled by the plain text of the \nstatute. See id. at 61. \nBecause the Opinion was based on an '\"unjustified assumption \"' about the statute, \nAstraZeneca was entitled to relief. Id. at 61-62 ( quoting Am. Lung Ass 'n v. EPA, 985 F.3d 914, \n944 (D.C. Cir. 2021)). Before disposing of the cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court \nopted to provide the parties with an opportunity to submit additional views. See id. at 62. \nTwo days later, and before the Court was able to grant AstraZeneca appropriate relief, the \nacting general counsel of HHS withdrew the Opinion. (D.I. 81-1) In a joint status report filed \nshortly thereafter, the government argued that the withdrawal of the Opinion mooted \nAstraZeneca 's claims. (D.I. 82) The Court disagreed , observing that the record demonstrated \nthe government's intent to \"act in accordance with the withdrawn Opinion.\" (D.I. 83 at 2) In \nlight of the parties' additional views, the Court granted AstraZeneca 's summary judgment motion \nwith respect to one of its claims -that the Opinion was arbitrary and capricious -and denied the \ncorresponding portion of the government 's motion. (See id. at 2-3) The Court denied without \nprejudice AstraZeneca's summary judgment motion with respect to the remaining claims and the \n4 corresponding portions of the government 's cross-motion for summary judgment. (See id. at 3) \nThe Court also vacated and set aside the Opinion. (See id. )4 \nIn the meantime , while the parties were briefing the issues regarding the Opinion, HRSA \nsent AstraZeneca the Violation Letter. (AR 1-2) In it, HRSA states that, after a review of \nAstraZeneca 's new policy regarding 340B drugs and \"an analysis of the complaints HRSA has \nreceived from covered entities, HRSA has determined that AstraZeneca's actions have resulted in \novercharges and are in direct violation of the 340B statute.\" (AR 1) The Violation Letter \npoints specifically to the statute's \"shall offer\" requirement , which provides that drug \nmanufacturers '\" shall ... offer each covered entity covered outpatient drugs for purchase at or \nbelow the applicable ceiling price if such drug is made available to any other purchaser at any \nprice.\"' (Id.) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(a)(l)) According to HRSA, \"[n]othing in the 340B \nstatute grants a [ drug] manufacturer the right to place conditions on its fulfillment of its statutory \nobligation to offer 340B pricing on covered outpatient drugs purchased by covered entities.\" \n(Id.) \nThe Violation Letter goes on to state that the agency's interpretation of the 340B statute \nhas been consistent for over 25 years: \"HRSA has made plain, consistently since the issuance of \nits 1996 contract pharmacy guidance, that the 340B statute requires manufacturers to honor ... \n4 After the Court vacated and set aside the Opinion, another district court endorsed this \nCourt's reasoning and similarly concluded that the Opinion was arbitrary and capricious . See \nEli Lilly & Co. v. US Dep't of Health & Hum. Servs., 2021 WL 5039566, at *14 (S.D. Ind. Oct. \n29, 2021). In light of this Court's decision and the Eli Lilly decision, a third district court \ndetermined that another drug manufacturer's claims regarding the Opinion were moot. See \nSanofi-Aventis US, LLC v. US Dep 't of Health & Hum. Servs., ---F. Supp. 3d. ---, 2021 WL \n5150464, at *55 (D.N.J. Nov. 5, 2021). \n5 purchases [ of 340B drugs] regardless of the dispensing mechanism. \" (Id.) The Violation Letter \ninstructs AstraZeneca that it \"must immediately begin offering its covered outpatient drugs at the \n340B ceiling price to covered entities through their contract pharmacy arrangements.\" (Id. at 2) \nIn the next sentence, the agency tells AstraZeneca it \"must comply with its 340B statutory \nobligations\" and \"refund all covered entities for overcharges that have resulted from \nAstraZeneca 's policy.\" (Id.) Otherwise , the Violation Letter warns, AstraZeneca may face civil \nmonetary penalties of up to $5,883 per overcharge . (Id. at 2 & n.3) Ultimately , a decision on \nwhether to impose civil monetary penalties will be made by HHS's Office of the Inspector \nGeneral. (See D.I. 100-1 Ex. A) \nAfter the Court vacated and set aside the Opinion, AstraZeneca filed a second amended \ncomplaint. (D.I. 86) (\"2d Am. Compl.\") The revised pleading includes the first three claims \nfrom the previous version of the complaint , on which the Court has already ruled. (Id. ,r,r 152-\n73) It also adds three new claims regarding the Violation Letter: \n\u2022 In its fourth claim, AstraZeneca seeks declaratory /injunctive relief that, in \nissuing and enforcing the Violation Letter, Defendants failed to observe \nnotice-and-comment procedures , in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(D) . \n(2d Am. Compl. ,r,r 174-80) \n\u2022 In its fifth claim, AstraZeneca seeks declaratory /injunctive relief that the \nViolation Letter exceeds Defendants ' statutory authority under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 256(b), in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) , (C). (2d Am. Compl. \n,r,r 181-86) \n\u2022 In its sixth claim, AstraZeneca seeks declaratory /injunctive relief that the \nViolation Letter is arbitrary and capricious , in violation of 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 706(2)(A). (2dAm. Compl. ,r,r 187-93) \n6 The parties agreed on a schedule for the filing of the administrative record and briefing on \nAstraZeneca's new claims regarding the Violation Letter, which the Court approved . (D.I. 84, \n85) \nThe Court has carefully considered the administrative record and the briefing, as well as \nvarious letters, a notice of supplemental authority, and multiple joint status reports submitted by \nthe parties. (SeegenerallyD.I. 88-1, 91, 93, 94, 95,100,102,104,106,107,108,110,111) \nThe Court heard oral argument by videoconference on October 18, 2021. (See D.I. 103) (\"Tr.\") \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n\"[W]hen a party seeks review of agency action under the APA, the district judge sits as an \nappellate tribunal.\" Am. Bioscience , Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1083 (D.C. Cir. 2001). \nIn that posture, \"[t]he entire case on review is a question of law.\" Marshall Cnty. Health Care \nAuth. v. Shala/a, 988 F.2d 1221, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Accordingly , the \"customary summary \njudgment standard\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 \"does not apply.\" Bintz v. Fed. \nEmergency Mgmt. Agency, 413 F. Supp. 3d 349,360 (D. Del. 2019) (citing Am. Bioscience , 269 \nF.3d at 1083). Rather, the APA provides the applicable standard for the reviewing court. See \nid. According to the APA, the Court shall \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action\" that is \n\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion , or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" \"in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction , authority, or limitations ,\" or \"without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) , (C) & (D). \n7 DISCUSSION \nI. The Violation Letter Is Based On Essentially The Same Interpreta tion Of The 340B \nStatute As The Vacated Opinion \nAstraZeneca principall y argues that the Violation Letter is \"based on the same 'legally \nflawed' reading\" of the 340B statute that plagued the Opinion. (D.I. 91 at 9 (capitalization \nmodified ); see also Tr. at 6) The Court agrees. \nA comparison of the Violation Letter and the Opinion reveals multiple parallels between \nthe documents: \n\u2022 Both the Violation Letter and the Opinion emphasize the \"shall offer\" \nlanguage in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(a)(l) , i.e., Section 340B(a)(l). \n(Compare AR 1 (\"Section 340B(a)(l) of the Public Health Service (PHS) \nAct requires that manufacturers 'shall ... offer each covered entity \ncovered outpatient drugs for purchase at or below the applicable ceiling \nprice if such drug is made available to any other purchaser at any price.\"') \nwith AR 8049 (\"[T]he core requirement of the 340B statute ... is that \nmanufacturers must 'offer' covered outpatient drugs at or below the \nceiling price for 'purchase by' covered entities.\")) \n\u2022 Both the Violation Letter and the Opinion state that the 340B statute \nestablishes an unqualified requirement. \n( Compare AR 1 (\"This requirement is not qualified , restricted , or \ndependent on how the covered entity chooses to distribute the covered \noutpatient drugs.\") with AR 8049 (\"This fundamental requirement is not \nqualified , restricted , or dependent on how the covered entity chooses to \ndistribute the covered outpatient drugs.\")) \n\u2022 Both the Violation Letter and the Opinion suggest that a drug \nmanufacturer 's refusal to facilitate sales of covered outpatient drugs for \ndispensing by an unlimited number of contract pharmacies directly \ncontravenes the 340B statute. \n(Compare AR 1 (\"HRSA has determined that AstraZeneca 's actions have \nresulted in overcharges and are in direct violation of the 340B statute.\") \nwith AR 8049 (\"The plain meaning of Section 340B requires \nmanufacturers to sell covered drugs to covered entities at or below the \nceiling price, independent of whether the entity opts to use contract \npharmacies to dispense the drugs.\") ( capitalization modified)) \n8 \u2022 Both the Violation Letter and the Opinion underscore that drug \nmanufacturers may not place conditions on their offers of 340B drugs. \n(Compare AR 1 (\"Nothing in the 340B statute grants a manufacturer the \nright to place conditions on its fulfillment of its statutory obligation to \noffer 340B pricing on covered outpatient drugs purchased by covered \nentities.\") with AR 8052 ('\" [M]anufacturers cannot condition sale of a \n340B drug at the 340B ceiling price because they have concerns or \nspecific evidence of possible non-compliance by a covered entity.'\") \n( quoting 340B Drug Pricing Program Ceiling Price and Manufacturer \nCivil Monetary Penalties Regulation , 82 Fed. Reg. 1210, 1223 (Jan. 5, \n2017))) \n\u2022 Both the Violation Letter and the Opinion insist that HRSA's interpretation \nof the 340B statute has remained constant. \n( Compare AR 1 (\"HRSA has made plain, consistently since the issuance \nof its 1996 contract pharmacy guidance, that the 340B statute requires \nmanufacturers to honor such purchases regardless of the dispensing \nmechanism.\") with AR 8051 (\"The Department's longstanding \ninterpretation of the statute, as expressed through guidance, is that \nmanufacturers are required to offer ceiling prices even where contract \npharmacies are used.\") (citing Notice Regarding Section 602 of the \nVeterans Health Care Act of 1992; Contract Pharmacy Services, 61 Fed. \nReg. 43,549 (Aug. 23, 1996) (\"1996 Guidance\"); Notice Regarding 340B \nDrug Pricing Program -Contract Pharmacy Services, 75 Fed. Reg. 10,272 \n(Mar. 5, 2010) (\"2010 Guidance \"))) \nOne difference between the documents is that the Opinion leans heavily on the \n\"purchased by\" language in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(a)(l), whereas the Violation Letter focuses \nexclusively on the \"shall offer\" requirement , which is also in\u00a7 256b(a)(l) . (Compare AR 8049-\n50 with AR 1)5 That difference is not particularl y relevant here because both documents still \n5 The government argues that the Violation Letter does not rely exclusively , or perhaps \neven at all, on the \"shall offer\" requirement. (Tr. at 43) In the government's view, the \nViolation Letter relies additionally on the statute's \"purchased by\" language, reasoning \"these \ncommands are found in the same statutory subsection, and the Violation Letter repeatedly \ndiscusses the '340B statute' throughout its text.\" (D.I. 94 at 6) That argument is unpersuasive. \nThe paragraph of the Violation Letter that quotes the \"shall offer\" requirement goes on to discuss \n9 insist that drug manufacturers ' obligations with respect to contract pharmacies flow directly from \nthe text of\u00a7 256b(a)(l). Indeed, the government admits that the Violation Letter \"relies directly \non statutory text.\" (D.I. 93 at 11) \nIt is not surprising that the Violation Letter takes essentially the same legal position as the \none espoused in the Opinion. The Opinion was issued by HHS' general counsel, who \n\"[s]upervises all legal activities of the Department and its operating agencies,\" such as HRSA. \nStatement of Organization , Functions , and Delegations of Authority , 86 Fed. Reg. 6349, 6351 \n(Jan. 21, 2021 ). When HRSA sent AstraZeneca the Violation Letter, the Opinion was still in \neffect. 6 Accordingly , HRSA, when it sent AstraZeneca the Violation Letter, was bound to \nfollow the Opinion. Moreover , as even the government acknowledges , the Opinion is in the \nadministrative record supporting the Violation Letter precisely because HRSA relied on it in \nissuing the Violation Letter. (See D.I. 93 at 3) (\"[T]he administrative record demonstrates that \nthe agency considered that advice [in the Opinion] alongside other statutory interpretations \n.... \") \nBecause the Violation Letter advances essentiall y the same statutory interpretation as the \none contained in the Opinion, the Court's previous analysis of the 340B statute applies here with \nequal force. See generally AstraZeneca , 543 F. Supp. 3d at 58-62; see also D.I. 93 at 25-26 \n(government acknowledging that, in Violation Letter, agency \"grounded its determination in the \ndrug manufacturers ' obligations with respect to that specific requirement . (See AR 1) The \nViolation Letter says nothing about the \"purchased by\" language. \n6 This Court did not vacate and set aside the Opinion until the end of the following \nmonth. (See D.I. 83 at 3) \n10 340B statute's text\"); Tr. at 48 (government acknowledging that \"agencies can't base an \nenforcement action [on] guidance,\" but must \"base an enforcement action on the statute\"). 7 The \nCourt will not repeat all that analysis here but will, instead, highlight some of the key points. \nMost importantly, the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(a) never mentions pharmacies , which is a \n\"strong indication that the statute does not compel any particular outcome with respect to \ncovered entities' use of pharmacies. \" AstraZeneca , 543 F. Supp. 3d at 59. That omission is \nnotable because another provision in \u00a7 256b explicitly refers to certain affiliates of covered \nentities. See id. at 60. It is difficult to imagine that \"Congress enumerated 15 types of covered \nentities with a high degree of precision \" and then intended to impliedly sweep in sales \nimplicating contract pharmacies. Id. \nMoreover, the \"legislative history is of no greater assistance to the government. \" Id. In \n1996, Congress considered but ultimately rejected language referring to drugs \"purchased and \ndispensed by, or under a contract entered into for on-site pharmacy services with\" covered \nentities. See S. Rep. No. 102-259 at 2 (1992).8 The exclusion of that language indicates that \n7 In the latest round of briefing, the government offers additional arguments in favor of \nits preferred statutory interpretation . (E.g., D.I. 93 at 13 (explaining history of\"shall offer\" \nrequirement); id. at 14-15 ( discussing Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020)) The \ngovernment does not convincingly explain why it did not make its additional arguments earlier in \nthis case. The Court has not been persuaded that it should reconsider its interpretation of the \n340B statute. See generallyACLUv . Mukasey, 534 F.3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2008) (\"Under the \nlaw-of-the-case doctrine, 'when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue \nto govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\"') ( quoting Christianson v. Colt \nIndus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816 (1988)). \n8 The government seizes on a typographical error in the Court's previous memorandum \nopinion, where the Court mistakenly referred to congressional action occurring in 2010, even \nthough the Court correctly cited the pertinent Senate Report with the correct date: 1992. (D.I. \n11 Congress did not clearly intend for drug manufacturers to be required to facilitate sales of \ncovered drugs for dispensing by an unlimited number of contract pharmacies. See AstraZeneca, \n543 F. Supp. 3d at 60-61.9 \nBecause the Violation Letter rests on essentially the same flawed statutory interpretation \nthat the Court already rejected, the Violation Letter cannot stand. See generally Am. Lung Ass 'n, \n985 F.3d at 944; Peter Pan Bus Lines, Inc. v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 4 71 F.3d 1350, \n1354 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\"[D]eference to an agency's interpretation of a statute is not appropriate \nwhen the agency wrongly believes that interpretation is compelled by Congress.\") (internal \nquotation marks omitted). It does not matter that the Violation Letter does not describe the \nstatute as \"unambiguous\" because the Violation Letter still evinces an understanding that its \nconclusion is driven by a clear statutory command with respect to drug manufacturers' \nobligations. (See Tr. at 21) Accordingly, the Court will vacate and set aside the Violation \nLetter, just as it vacated and set aside the Opinion. \n93 at 19; Tr. at 57; see also AstraZeneca, 543 F. Supp. 3d at 60) That error does not provide a \nbasis for \"this Court to reconsider its assessment of the legislative history.\" (D.I. 93 at 19) \nWithout the error, the Court's analysis still would have been the same. \n9 The government maintains that the legislative history contradicts the Court's \ninterpretation . According to the government, Congress' omission of the reference to drugs \n\"dispensed by\" pharmacies located \"on-site\" was intended to remove a restriction on possible \ndispensing mechanisms for covered entities. (D.I. 93 at 19) The Court agrees with \nAstraZeneca that the government 's reading focuses too much on selected words in the omitted \nphrase rather than on the omission of the entire phrase. As AstraZeneca explains, \"once \nCongress had dropped the (far longer and more specific) contract pharmacy language -thereby \nlimiting 340B discounts to sales made to covered entities themselves -there was no need to \nspecify that the covered entity who 'purchased ' the drug also 'dispensed' it.\" (D.I. 95 at 7; see \nalso Tr. at 19-20) \n12 II. The Violation Letter Rests On The Faulty Assumption That HRSA's Position Has \nNot Shifted Over Time \nThe Violation Letter states that \"HRSA has made plain, consistently since the issuance \nof its 1996 contract pharmacy guidance , that the 340B statute requires manufacturers to honor \n... purchases [of covered outpatient drugs] regardless of the dispensing mechanism.\" (AR 1) \n( emphasis added) The Court's previous memorandum opinion explained, however, that the \nagency's position has not been consistent over the past 25 years. See generally AstraZeneca, \n543 F. Supp. 3d at 54-57. Again, the Court need not rehash that entire discussion here, though a \nfew points are worth emphasizing. \nTo start, the Violation Letter focuses on the \"shall offer\" requirement (see AR 1 ), which \nCongress did not add to the 340B statute until 2010. Because the 1996 and 2010 Guidance \ndocuments were issued before the \"shall offer\" requirement was enacted, the Violation Letter \ntreads at least some \"new ground.\" See Indep. Equip. Dealers Ass 'n v. EPA, 372 F.3d 420, 428 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004). Additionally, the 1996 and 2010 Guidance documents were directed to \ncovered entities, see AstraZeneca, 543 F. Supp. 3d at 55, whereas the Violation Letter is directed \nto a specific drug manufacturer. 10 Moreover , the 1996 and 2010 Guidance documents attempted \nto fill statutory gaps, see id., but the Violation Letter seeks to enforce a requirement allegedly \ncontained in the statute. Notably, AstraZeneca 's new policy regarding 340B drugs would have \ncomplied with the parameters set out in the 1996 Guidance , see id. at 56, while the Violation \n10 HRSA issued additional violation letters to other drug manufacturers. (See AR 3-12) \nThose letters were substantially the same as the letter addressed to AstraZeneca. \n13 Letter determines that AstraZeneca's new policy does not comport with the agency's current \nunderstanding of the 340B statute. 11 \nTo summarize, the Court provides the following updated table of differences among all \nthe relevant documents : \nDocument Directed to: Number of Mode of Based on DoesAZ's \nContract Analysis \"Shall Off er\" 2020 \nPharmacies Requirement? Policy \nPermitted Comply? \n1996 Covered One Programmatic No Yes \nGuidance entities Gap Filling ( did not exist) \n2010 Covered Unlimited Programmatic No No \nGuidance entities Gap Filling ( did not exist) \n2020 Drug Unlimited Statutory Yes (in part) No \nOpinion manufacturers Interpretation \n2021 AstraZeneca Unlimited Enforcement Yes No \nViolation \nLetter \nAs this Court has explained, the Opinion was \"the first document in which HHS explicitly \nconcluded that drug manufacturers are required by statute to provide 340B drugs to multiple \ncontract pharmacies.\" Id at 55-56 (emphasis omitted). Now that the Opinion has been vacated \nand set aside, the Violation Letter (and the similar letters sent to other drug manufacturers) are \nthe only documents concluding that the 340B statute requires drug manufacturers to facilitate \nsales of covered outpatient drugs for dispensing by an unlimited number of contract pharmacies. \n11 Another district court that considered the 1996 and 2010 Guidance documents agreed \nwith this Court that the agency's \"position has in fact shifted over time.\" Novartis Pharms. \nCorp. v. Espinosa, 2021 WL 5161783, at *8 (D.D.C. Nov. 5, 2021). Yet another district court \nagreed that the agency has changed its views but also concluded that the agency sufficiently \nexplained its changes. See Sanofi-Aventis , 2021 WL 5150464, at *50-53. This Court \nrespectfully disagrees with that conclusion. \n14 Despite the logical application of the reasoning in the Court's previous memorandum \nopinion to the Violation Letter, the government maintains that the Violation Letter is consistent \nwith the view the agency has held all along. It states, for example, \"HRSA respectfully \ncontends that its interpretation of manufacturers ' obligations does not shift every time that HHS \nchanges its guidance with respect to covered entities' rights.\" (D.I. 94 at 8) (internal quotation \nmarks and brackets omitted) That contention directly contradicts the Court's previous \nmemorandum opinion. See AstraZeneca , 453 F. Supp. 3d at 57.12 So the government asks the \nCourt to \"reconsider its conclusion \" in light of the latest round of briefing (D.I. 93 at 26), but the \nCourt has been provided no meritorious basis to do so. See D. Del. LR 7.1.5 (noting that \nmotions for reconsideration should be granted \"sparirigly\"); see also Smith v. Meyers, 2009 WL \n5195928, at * 1 (D. Del. Dec. 30, 2009) (\"A motion for reconsideration is not properly grounded \non a request that a court rethink a decision already made.\"). \nNotably, the government points to a guidance document that was not cited during the \nprevious round of briefing on the parties' earlier motions. See Final Notice Regarding Section \n602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Entity Guidelines, 59 Fed. Reg. 25,110 (May 13, \n1994) (\"1994 Guidance\"); see also D.I. 93 at 22 (government acknowledging that \"the previous \n12 As the Court previously explained: \nIn this context, it is inaccurate to insist that manufacturers' duties have never \nchanged, solely on the grounds that the government has always required \nmanufacturers to accommodate all contract pharmacy arrangements that the \ngovernment has permitted . Again, because the government has changed what \ncovered entities may do, it has consequently changed what drug manufacturers \nmust do. \nAstraZeneca, 543 F. Supp. 3d at 57. \n15 briefing before this Court did not include the 1994 guidance\"). In that document , HRSA \nannounced \"final program guidelines regarding eligible covered entities.\" Id. at 25,110. The \nagency noted in the 1994 Guidance that \"issues deal[ing] with manufacturer guidelines \" were \n\"beyond the scope\" of that document. Id. In explaining the covered entity guidelines , the 1994 \nGuidance refers to a comment in which a stakeholder asked the agency not to require \nmanufacturers \"to sell directly to ... a contract pharmacy,\" but only to \"covered entities and \ntheir wholesalers.\" Id. at 25,111. HRSA rejected that proposal because covered entities \"often \nuse ... contract pharmacies,\" and the agency did not want covered entities to be discouraged \nfrom participating in the 340B Program. See id. \nThe Court agrees with AstraZeneca that the government's reliance on the 1994 Guidance \nis faulty in a few ways. (See D.I. 95 at 10) First, the Violation Letter says that HRSA's \nposition has been \"consistent[] since the issuance of its 1996 contract pharmacy guidance\" (AR \n1) ( emphasis added), a statement which plainly does not encompass the 1994 Guidance . It is a \nfundamental principle of administrative law that \"a reviewing court ... must judge the propriety \nof [agency] action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.\" SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 \nU.S. 194, 196 (1947); see also Tr. at 52. Courts do not accept counsel's ''post hoc \nrationalizations.\" Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962). \nSecond, and consistent with the Court's analysis above, the government previously told the Court \nexpressly that the 1996 Guidance was the first relevant guidance document. (D.I. 76 at 65-66)13 \nThus, the Court should not even consider the 1994 Guidance . \n13 While the government made this statement in connection with the Court's review of \n16 In any event, the 1994 Guidance does not save the government, as it is inconsistent \nregarding its implications for drug manufacturers . On one hand, it suggests that drug \nmanufacturers should be required to facilitate sales of 340B drugs dispensed by contract \npharmacies . See 1996 Guidance , 59 Fed. Reg. at 25,111. On the other hand, it acknowledges \nthat it is not providing any guidelines for manufacturers . Id. at 25,110 (explaining that \n\"manufacturer guidelines \" are \"beyond the scope of this notice\"). The Court hesitates to read \ntoo much into a single paragraph on drug manufacturers ' duties with respect to contract \npharmacies when the whole document was never intended to impose any duties on drug \nmanufacturers. \nAnother reason for hesitancy in according any weight to the 1994 Guidance is that it \n(somewhat confusingly) refers to sales from drug manufacturers \"to intermediaries,\" such as \ncontract pharmacies . Id. at 25,111 ( emphasis added). In the instant litigation, however, the \ngovernment acknowledges that drug manufacturers are not required to sell covered drugs to \npharmacies but, instead, insists that manufacturers must facilitate arrangements in which sales \nare made to covered entities through contract pharmacies. (See D.I. 93 at 23-25; D.I. 94 at 5 \nn.1) That is, on the government's current view, drug manufacturers sell to covered entities -and \nnot to contract pharmacies -even when covered entities never physically possess the covered \noutpatient drugs. The 1994 Guidance appears to have assumed the materially different view that \nmanufacturers would sell covered drugs directly \"to intermediaries ,\" including pharmacies. \nthe Opinion, it is fair to conclude that the government's statement also applies to the Court's \nreview of the Violation Letter. (See D.I. 76 at 65-66) (Court asking if 1996 Guidance was \"first \nrelevant guidance\" in context of authorization for covered entities to work with contract \npharmacies) \n17 The 1994 Guidance is even more confusing when considered alongside the 1996 and \n2010 Guidance documents. If the 1994 Guidance is read as having approved arrangements \ninvolving multiple contract pharmacies , then the government would have to explain how and \nwhy it took a narrower view in the 1996 Guidance , when it limited covered entities to using only \na single contract pharmacy. Later, in 2010, it similarly would have to explain how and why it \nwas returning to a broader view. The administrative record does not reveal any credible \nexplanation , and the government has not offered one in the arguments before this Court. \nThe Violation Letter's failure to acknowledge that the agency's position has shifted over \ntime provides an independent basis for the Court to award AstraZeneca relief. See generally \nEncino Motorcar s, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211,221 (2016) (\"[T]he agency must at least \ndisplay awareness that it is changing position and show that there are good reasons for the new \npolicy.\") (internal quotation marks omitted); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, \n515 (2009) (\"An agency may not, for example, depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply \ndisregard rules that are still on the books.\"). Accordin gly, the Court will vacate and set aside the \nViolation Letter.14 \n14 All district courts that have considered similar violation letters addressed to other drug \nmanufacturers have at least partially vacated and/or set aside those letters, although they have \ndone so for different reasons. See Eli Lilly, 2021 WL 5039566, at *22-25 (holding that violation \nletter was arbitrary and capricious because HRSA failed to explain its \"change in position \nregarding its authority to enforce potential violations of the 340B statute connected to contract \npharmacy arrangements \"); Sanofi-Aventi s, 2021 WL 5150464, at *34-36, 42-45 (concluding that \n340B statute is ambiguous on contract pharmacy arrangement but also holding that statute does \nnot permit manufacturers to place conditions on offers; vacating violation letters and agency's \ndetermination that manufacturers owe refunds to covered entities for further consideration of \nhow many contract pharmacies are permitted under statute); Novartis, 2021 WL 5161783, at *8-\n9 (concluding that agency's guidance \"shifted over time\" and setting aside violation letters \n18 CONCLUSION \nAs the Court did previously (see D.I. 78 at 24), the Court concludes today by \nemphasizing what it is not deciding. The government spends much of its opening brief stressing \nthat a ruling against it will make it harder, or even impossible , for some patients of covered \nentities to obtain their medications. (See D.I. 93 at 3-10) The Court takes these concerns \nseriously and hopes that all patients of covered entities receive appropriate medical treatment. \nBut the only issue now before this Court is whether HRSA complied with its obligations under \nthe APA when it issued the Violation Letter. It did not.15 \nFor all the reasons explained above, the Court will vacate and set aside the Violation \nLetter and remand to the agency for further consideration. The Court will give the parties an \nopportunity to provide further input on how to dispose of the claims for relief in AstraZeneca 's \nsecond amended complaint and how (if at all) this case should now proceed. \nAn appropriate order follows. \nwithout declaring manufacturers ' policies permissible or impermissible). \n15 Given the Court's analysis, the Court does not reach other issues presented by the \nparties, including whether the Violation Letter is interpretive or legislative (see D.I. 91 at 15-20; \nD.I. 94 at 10-12), whether HRSA's threatened imposition of civil monetary penalties is improper \n(see D.I. 91 at 24-26; D.I. 94 at 7), or whether the evidence in the administrative record would \nsupport the imposition of such penalties (see D.I. 91 at 22-24; D.I. 94 at 3-5). On the last point, \nthe government emphasizes that it assembled a \"voluminous \" administrative record of over \n8,000 pages, including myriad instances of AstraZeneca allegedly overcharging covered entities. \n(See D.I. 93 at 1, 3, 25; D.I. 94 at 2; Tr. at 28) Given the Court's analysis of the legal questions \npresented here, the bulk of the administrative record is largely immaterial to the government 's \ncase. (See Tr. at 75-76) (\"[I]f the government is right about the statutory interpretation , then \n[AstraZeneca's policy] would be a problem. But ifwe [AstraZeneca] are right about the \nstatutory interpretation, then it's not a problem. And all of the government's evidence points to \nthat same central fact.\") \n19 "}
