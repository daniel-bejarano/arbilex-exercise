No. 21-1824-VAC\n\nCITY OF WILMINGTON, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\neee SS NS NS\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDavid Q. Webb, Newark, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMay 24, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nCONNOLLY, CHIEF JUDGE:\n\nPlaintiff David Q. Webb commenced this action on December 27, 2021. (D.I. 2)\nHe appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 2)\nAlso pending are several motions filed by Plaintiff. (D.1. 5, 8, 9) The Court proceeds to\nreview and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b).\n\nIL. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umiand v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.\n2008). Plaintiff raises his claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\nThe Complaint names 19 defendants located in the States of Delaware, Nevada,\nGeorgia, Connecticut, and Florida, and that include city and county governments, city\nand county officials and employees, private individuals, and three estates. (D.I. 2 at 2-\n13)\n\nPlaintiff alleges Defendant government entities are direct recipients of federal\nfunding, and they engaged in intentional discrimination based upon Plaintiff's race,\ncolor, and national origin as an African American male and violated his rights under the\nFirst, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution by means of a\nNovember 9, 2021 illegal Sheriff's sale of real property located in Wilmington, Delaware.\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants intentionally ignored a June 29, 2011 final master\nreport from the Court of Chancery of Delaware that \u201clegaily stipulated that Plaintiff Webb\nis a legal heir to the Estate of John L. Webb\u2019 and in doing so violated Plaintiff's rights\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause. (/d. at 17-25)\nIn addition, Plaintiff alleges that several defendants failed to properly ensure that\nthe probate process for the Estate of John L. Webb (Plaintiff's father) was timely\nresolved and pursuant to Delaware law. (/d. at 21-23) Plaintiff also alleges that several\ndefendants participated in fraud on the court by presenting \u201cevidence that had no factual\nbasis of proof stipulating that Plaintiff [] was not his brother after 48 years of\nrecognizing\u2019 Plaintiff as his brother during the March 16, 2010 registration at the New\nCastle County Register of Wills Office and through the illegal sale of the real property\nlocated in Wilmington, Delaware. (/d. at 23)\n\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n\ni. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a\ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir.\n2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must\naccept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most\nfavorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d\nCir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro\nse, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded,\nmust be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\n\n2\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u2019 or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant\nPlaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.\nSee Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem\u2019I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\n\n3\n\n|\n|\ni\n|\ni\ni\ni\n\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nlll. DISCUSSION\n\nThis is the second time Plaintiff has sought relief for issues arising out of the\nadministration of the estate of his father, who died intestate on February 24, 2010. See\nWebb v. Poppiti, 2013 WL 5701051 (D. Del. Oct. 17, 2013) (providing background from\n2010 through 2013). It is evident in reading the Complaint that Plaintiffs claims result\nfrom his dissatisfaction with Delaware state courts\u2019 rulings regarding the Estate of\nWebb, with the probate process and, particularly, the Sheriffs sale of real property\nlocated in Wilmington, Delaware. Plaintiff's avenue of relief lies in state court. To the\nextent Plaintiff seeks review and rejection of Delaware state decisions, the claims fall\nunder the purview of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and, therefore, the Court cannot\nexercise jurisdiction.'\n\nEven if the Court had jurisdiction, it finds that the Complaint fails to set forth a\nplausible claim. The claims are pled in a conclusory manner. There are no factual\nallegations in the Complaint that would provide a plausible basis to conclude that\nDefendants intentionally discriminated against Plaintiff because of his race in violation of\n\nTitle VI. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d; Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001).\n\n1 The Rooker-Feldman doctrine refers to principles set forth by the Supreme Court in\nRooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923), and District of Columbia Court of\nAppeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983). Because the doctrine divests the court of\nsubject matter jurisdiction, it may be raised at any time by the court sua sponte. Desi's\nPizza, Inc. v. City of Wilkes-Barre, 321 F.3d 411, 419 (3d Cir. 2003); Nesbit v. Gears\nUnlimited, \\nc., 347 F.3d 72, 77 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n4\nTo the extent that Plaintiff seeks relief under \u00a7 1983, he fails to plausibly allege that a\nstate actor violated his constitutional or federal rights to maintain such a claim. See\nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) (\u201cTo state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must\nallege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States,\nand must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under\ncolor of state law.\u201d).\n\nPlaintiff also complains that the probate matter moved too slowly through the\ncourts. In Plaintiff's first case, he was advised that he has no constitutional right to a\nspeedy resolution of the probate matter and such claims are frivolous. See Webb v.\nPoppiti, 2013 WL 5701051 at *4. Plaintiffs fraud on the court claims also fail as\ndeficiently pled. See Herring v. United States, 424 F.3d 384-386087 (3d Cir. 2004)\n(setting forth elements of a fraud on the court claim). Finally, the Complaint refers to\nPlaintiffs relatives\u2019 failure to recognize him as the son of the decedent, John L. Webb.\nPlaintiff raised the issue in the first case he filed in this Court and, therefore, the claims\nare barred. See Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 767 F.3d 247 (3d Cir. 2014).\n\nThe Court lacks jurisdiction and, in the alternative, Plaintiff fails to state\ncognizable claims. Therefore, the Complaint will be dismissed. Amendment is futile.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as moot the motions filed by (D.1.\n\n5, 8, 9); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii).\nAmendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n"}
