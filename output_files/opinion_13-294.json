INTRODUCTION \n  \nPetitioner has filed a Motion to Disqualify th e Delaware Attorney General\u2019s Office as \ncounsel for the State.  (D.I. 94)  He argues th at his former post-conviction attorney, Ms. Kathryn \nGarrison, has a conflict based on her interests in en suring Petitioner\u2019s interests (as her former client) \nare not harmed, while also protecting the Delaware  Department of Justice\u2019s (\u201cDDOJ\u201d) interests (as \nher current employer) and advancing her career wi th DDOJ.  (D.I. 94 at 5)  Petitioner further \ncontends that Ms. Garrison\u2019s conflict should be im puted to the entire Delaware Attorney General\u2019s \nOffice, thereby providing grounds for disqualifying that Office.  ( Id.) For the reasons set forth \nbelow, the Court will deny the Motion.    II. BACKGROUND \n  On June 16, 2003, a Delaware Superior Court  jury found Petitioner guilty of first degree \nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.  See Ploof v. State , 856 A.2d  2539, 541 (Del. 2004).  The Superior Court sen tenced Petitioner to death on August 22, 2003.  See id . \nThe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions and capital sentence on August 11, \n2004.  See id. at 548. \nOn July 6, 2005, [Petitioner] filed a timely pro se  motion for \npostconviction relief under the versi on of Delaware Superior Court \nCriminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61\u201d) in effect at the time.  On September 2, 2005, the Superior Court appointed Ronald Poliquin, Esquire to represent [Petitioner] in postc onviction. On January 13, 2006, \n[Petitioner\u2019s] trial counsel submitted affidavits addressing [his] claims of ineffective assistance of counse l.  On February 17, 2006, the State \nresponded to [Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61] motion, and [Petitioner\u2019s] \npostconviction counsel submitted a supplement and reply on March 27, 2006.  On May 30, 2006, postconviction counsel notified the Superior Court that he had a conflict of interest and could no longer represent [Petitioner].  The Superior Court substituted Valerie Dunkle, Esquire, Thomas Donovan, Esquire and James Liguori, Esquire for \nMr. Poloquin as [Petitioner\u2019s] postconviction counsel.  On October 27, 2006, the Superior Court appointed Kathryn Garrison, Esquire to replace Ms. Dunkle as [Petitioner\u2019s] counsel.  On June 6, 2008, [Petitioner\u2019s] new postconviction counsel filed a motion to amend his postconviction motion to include additional claims along with points of law, which counsel corrected on June 9, 2008.  Then, on July 21, 2008, [Petitioner\u2019s] postconviction counsel filed a corrected amended \nmotion for postconviction relief and points of law, which the State answered on July 31, 2008.  On October 1, 2008, [Petitioner] filed his reply. On December 24, 2009, counsel with the [the Federal Community Defender\u2019s Capital Habeas Unit for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania] were admitted pro hac  vice to also assist [Petitioner] in \nhis postconviction proceeding.  On November 22, 2010, the Superior Court held a six-day evidentiary hearing on [Petitioner\u2019s] postconviction motion.  Following addi tional briefing by the parties, \non January 30, 2012, the Superior Court issued an order and opinion denying [Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 61] motion.  [Petitioner] appealed the \nSuperior Court\u2019s denial of postc onviction relief to the Delaware \nSupreme Court.  On June 4, 2013, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed in part the Superior Court \u2019s judgment, but remanded the case \nto the Superior Court to reweigh the sum of the aggravating and mitigating evidence during the pena lty phase in view of [Petitioner\u2019s] \nclaims that his trial counsel were ineffective for not presenting additional evidence about [his] military service and that [he] grew up in an abusive home.  On July 15, 2013, the Superior Court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law from the reweighing process and concluded that [Petitioner\u2019s] ineffectiveness claims were meritless because \u201c[Petitioner] has failed to show a reasonable probability of a different outcome.\u201d  On October 30, 2013, the Delaware Supreme  3Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief.  \nOn November 5, 2013, the Superi or Court reimposed [Petitioner\u2019s] \ndeath sentence.  \n (D.I. 66 at 2-3)  \nOn November 6, 2013, Ms. Garrison submitted a letter to the Superior \nCourt, which became part of the public docket, advising that she was now working for the Delaware Department of Justice\u2019s (\u201cDDOJ\u201d) Appeals Unit and could no longer represent [Petitioner].  On the following day, November 7, 2013, the Superior Court approved Ms. Garrison\u2019s request to withdraw as [Petitioner\u2019s] counsel.  \n (D.I. 95 at 4-5)  \nIn January 2014, the Office of the Federal Pu blic Defender for the District of Delaware \n(\u201cDelaware FPDO\u201d) filed in this Court a petiti on for a writ of habeas corpus (\u201cPetition\u201d) on \nPetitioner\u2019s behalf.  (D.I. 7)  The Petition was st ayed in December 2014 under a stipulated order to \npermit Petitioner to present certain unexhausted clai ms in the Delaware courts in a second Rule 61 \nmotion.  (D.I. 24)  In December 2017, the Superi or Court summarily dismissed Petitioner\u2019s second \nRule 61 motion, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision.  See State v. Ploof , 2017 WL \n7804294 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 28, 2017); Ploof v. State , 194 A.3d 908 (Table), 2018 WL 4600814 (Del. \nSept. 18, 2018).  \n  In April 2019, the Delaware FPDO filed an amended federal habeas Petition on \nPetitioner\u2019s behalf.  (D.I. 59 )  In January 2020, the State filed an Answer substantively addressing \nPetitioner\u2019s claims as well as exhaustion, procedural default, and the merits of the claims.  (D.I. 66)  \nThe Delaware FPDO was granted several extensions of ti me to file a traverse.  (D.I. 71; D.I. 73; D.I. \n74)  In December 2020, the Delaware FPDO withdr ew from the instant case and counsel from the \nFederal Public Defender for the Middle Dist rict of Pennsylvania (\u201cPennsylvania FPDO\u201d) was \nappointed to represent Petitioner.  (D.I. 78; D.I.  81)  Two more unopposed extensions of time for \nPetitioner to file his traverse/reply were granted.  (D.I. 82; D.I. 86)    4On July 20, 2021, the Pennsylvania FPDO filed a notice of conflict of interest and request \nfor a teleconference.  (D.I. 88)  The Court held a teleconference with both Parties on September 10, \n2021.  (D.I. 90; DI. 91)1  On October 1, 2021, the State filed a follow-up letter response regarding \ncertain issues discussed during the teleconference, asserting (1) there is no conflict of interest \nimputable to the entire DDOJ2 based on Ms. Garrison\u2019s prior re presentation of Petitioner, for \nreasons including she has been sequestered from the case and other Appeals Unit deputies have \nhandled Petitioner\u2019s matters; and (2) \u201c[i]n the case of a conflict, which only happens occasionally in \nthe civil context, the DDOJ, to the extent possible, retains outside counsel and screens them in compliance with the Delaware Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Pr ofessional Conduct.\u201d  (D.I. 93 at 1)  The State  \nalso asserted that the DDOJ would not interfere with efforts by the Pennsylvania FPDO to communicate with Ms. Garrison.  (D.I. 93 at 1-2) \n On October 13, 2021, Petitioner filed th e Motion to Disqualify the Delaware Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Office as counsel for the State, which is  presently pending before the Court.  (D.I. 94)  \nThe State filed an Answer in Opposition, to wh ich Petitioner filed a Reply.  (D.I. 95; D.I. 96) \n \n    \n \n1 On the same date, the Court also had an ex parte  conversation with Petitioner\u2019s counsel from the \nPennsylvania FPDO.  Petitioner\u2019s counsel had requested the opportunity to speak ex parte  and \nRespondent did not oppose.  A court reporter took down what was said during the ex parte \nconversation and a transcript can be prepared should  it ever be necessary.  The details of what was \ndiscussed have not been shared with Respondent.  In  the Court\u2019s view, nothing relating to the topics \nof the ex parte conversation has had any impact on the i ssues presented by the pending motion and \nwould not (and will not) have any impact on the i ssues presented in the Petition.  Accordingly, \nPetitioner\u2019s request for discovery relating to issues discussed in the ex parte portion of the September \n10, 2021 status conference (as contained in an ex parte letter submitted to the Court on September \n17, 2021, with the Court\u2019s consent), is denied. \n \n2Both Parties use the terms \u201cDDOJ\u201d and \u201cDelawar e\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office\u201d interchangeably.  \nFor the purposes of this Memorandum and Order, the Court also uses both terms interchangeably when referring to counsel for the State.  5III.   LEGAL STANDARDS \n The Court has the inherent authority to super vise the professional conduct of attorneys \nappearing before it, including the power to disqualify an attorney from a representation.  See United \nStates v. Miller , 624 F.2d 1198, 1201 (3d Cir. 1980).  Mo tions to disqualify are \u201cgenerally disfavored\u201d \nand, therefore, require the moving party to clea rly show that \u201ccontinued representation would be \nimpermissible.\u201d  Talecris Biotherapeutics, Inc. v. Baxter Int'l Inc ., 491 F. Supp. 2d 51 0, 513 (D. Del. 2007); \nsee also Conley v. Chaffinch , 43l F. Supp. 2d 494, 496 (D. Del. 20 06).  Attorney conduct is governed by \nthe ethical standards of the court before which the attorney appears.  See In re Corn Derivatives \nAntitrust Litig ., 748 F.2d 157, 160 (3d Cir. 1984).  Th e District of Delaware has adopted the ABA\u2019s \nModel Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cM.R.P.C.\u201d).  See D. Del. LR 83.6(d).\n3    \nIV.   DISCUSSION  \nIn his Motion to Disqualify, Petitioner conten ds that Ms. Garrison has a conflict based on \nher interests in ensuring that Petitioner\u2019s interests are not harmed as her former client, protecting the \nDDOJ\u2019s interests, and advancing her career with the DDOJ.  (D.I. 94 at 5)  According to Petitioner, since the State asserts procedural default as a defens e to many of his habeas claims, \u201cMs. Garrison is \na material witness with interests in this case, and those interests are thoroughly entangled with her \nemployment with, and supervision by, counsel for\u201d the St ate.  (D.I. 96 at 2)  Petitioner contends that \nthe \u201conly way to ensure [he] can fairly pursue his res ponses to [the State\u2019s] procedural defenses is to \nremove those interests by disqualifyi ng the [Office of the] Attorney General\u201d as counsel the State.  \n \n3The Court notes that the Parties refer exclusively  to Delaware\u2019s Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional \nConduct (\u201cDelaware\u2019s L.R.P.C\u201d) rather than to the ABA\u2019s M.R.P.C.  Delaware\u2019s L.R.P.C. are \npatterned after the M.R.P.C., and the language used in  the ethical Rules relevant to the conflict of \ninterest issue in this proceeding is almost iden tical under the M.R.P.C. and Delaware\u2019s L.R.P.C.   \nCompare  M.R.P.C. Rules 1.7-1.11 with Delaware\u2019s L.R.P.C. Rules 1.7-1.11; see also In re Intel Corp. \nMicroprocessor Antitrust Litigation , 526 F. Supp. 2d 461, 465 n.4 (D. Del. 2007); United States v. Gordon , \n334 F. Supp. 2d 581, 585 n.7 (D. Del. 2004) (expl aining that \u201cModel Rules and the Delaware Rules \nare the same.\u201d).  Thus, the Court will refer to the M.R.P.C.  6(D.I. 96 at 2)  Therefore, Petitioner asks the Court  to enter an \u201corder directing the Attorney General \n. . . to exercise its authority to appoint a special Deputy Attorney General to represent [the State] in \nthis matter, and to disqualify the Office of the Attorney General\u201d as counsel for the State. (D.I. 94 at 9)    The State contends that the Court should deny Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Disqualify, because: \n(1) Petitioner waived his conflict of interest claim by waiting eight years after Ms. Garrison publicly \nadvised the Delaware Superior Court in November 2013 that she was recently employed by the DDOJ (D.I. 95 at 5); and (2) Petitioner has failed to demonstrate \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that there is a conflict of inter est imputable to the entire DDOJ . . . and that he will suffer \nprejudice.\u201d  (D.I. 95 at 11) \nA.  Waiver \n \u201cWaiver is a valid basis for denial of a motion to disqualify.\u201d  Conley v. Chaffinch,  431 F. Supp. \n2d 494, 498-99 (D. Del. 2006).  \u201cIn determining wh ether the moving party has waived its right to \nobject to the opposing party\u2019s counsel the court should consider the length of the delay in bringing a \nmotion to disqualify, when the movant learned of the conflict, whether the movant was represented \nby counsel during the delay, why the delay occu rred, and whether disqualification would result in \nprejudice to the nonmoving party.\u201d  Id. at 499. \n After considering the factors set forth in Conley , the Court concludes that Petitioner has \nwaived the instant conflict-of-interest/disqualificati on argument.  First, Petitioner filed the instant \nMotion to Disqualify in October 2021, almost eight full years after Ms. Garrison filed a letter in the \nSuperior Court providing notice that she was working at the DDOJ and requesting to withdraw her \nrepresentation of Petitioner. ( See D.I. 67-1 at 38, Entry No. 325)  The instant Motion was also filed \nseven years after the Delaware FPDO filed Petitioner\u2019s initial habeas Petition in this Court in 2014. \nA seven- or eight-year delay is sufficient to justify a finding of waiver, especially since Petitioner has  7been continuously represented by counsel during th e pendency of his state criminal proceedings and \nthis proceeding.  See Conley , 431 F. Supp. 2d at 498. \nSecond, Petitioner argues that he did not de lay in filing the instant Motion to Disqualify, \nbecause he only became aware of the relevant \u201cenhanced\u201d conflict of interest forming the basis for \nthe Motion to Disqualify \u2013 namely, Ms. Garrison\u2019s potential role as a witness \u2013 when the State asserted the defense of procedural default in the An swer it filed in 2020.  According to Petitioner, \nthe conflict of interest created by Ms. Garrison\u2019s employment with the DDOJ in 2013 differs from \nthe \u201cenhanced\u201d conflict of interest created by Ms. Garri son\u2019s new role as a potential witness, and  it \nwould be \u201cnonsensical\u201d to require him to raise a conf lict before it actually existed.  The Court is not \npersuaded.  Petitioner does not provide any legal authority supporting his approach of identifying \ndifferent degrees of conflicts arising at two differe nt periods during Petitioner\u2019s continued litigation \nconcerning the same crimes and convictions.  Dist illed to its core, Petitioner\u2019s attempt to create two \ndifferent types or levels of triggering conflicts of inter est is a splitting of semantic hairs.  Instead, the  \nCourt views the original conflict of interest that  was created when Petitioner joined the DDOJ as \ncontinuing until the issues concerning the same crim es and convictions are dispositively adjudicated.   \nAdditionally, the Court notes that procedural de fault is a common and routine defense raised \nin federal habeas proceedings, with the ineffective assistance of counsel during a petitioner\u2019s initial \ncollateral review proceeding often being raised as a method for establishing cause for a procedural default.  See e.g. Martinez v. Ryan , 566 U.S. 1 (2012).  In fact, Peti tioner\u2019s original Petition includes a \ngeneral claim alleging that post-conviction counsel pr ovided ineffective assistance during Petitioner\u2019s \ncollateral proceeding by failing to advance all availa ble legal claims or all available legal bases for \nclaims that were advanced.  (D.I. 7 at 230)  Th ese circumstances demonstr ate that Petitioner was  8aware of the so-called \u201cenhanced\u201d conflict of in terest forming the basis for his disqualification \nrequest long before the State filed its Answer in 2020.4   \nTurning to the next Conley  factor, the reason for the delay, Petitioner contends that the \nfailure to raise the issue of Ms. Garrison\u2019s \u201cenhanced\u201d conflict of interest at an earlier time is due to \nthe Delaware FPDO\u2019s ineffectiveness.  (D.I. 96 at  5 n.1)  The Court will not speculate as to the \nreason for the Delaware FPDO\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to raise the instant conflict of interest issue.5  \nNevertheless, the Court does not view the delay as a tactic.   \n \n4Relatedly, Petitioner asserts,   \n \nIf Ms. Garrison\u2019s status as a witness existed at some earlier date, then perhaps [the \nState\u2019s] argument [concerning the date on which Petitioner became aware of the \nconflict] would carry some weight, at least fa cially.  However, at that point the matter \nwould turn on whether Petitioner waived that conflict.  Any waiver of such a critical right on Petitioner\u2019s part cannot be imp lied by the inactions of the [Delaware \nFPDO].  E.g. DE Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.7, comment 22 (attorney \nmay go only so far as \u201crequest[ing]\u201d that a client waives conflict); Rule 1.9, comment \n9 (conflicts concerning former clients can onl y be waived by client in writing).  Upon \ninformation and belief, at no point did any member of the [Delaware FPDO] recognize the existence of any conflict of interest and obtain a waiver, and the files \nobtained from that office contain no such document.  No written waiver has been \nprovided to this Court.  Thus, Petitioner has not waived this conflict.  \n(D.I. 96 at 5 n.1)  \nPetitioner\u2019s argument is premised on an incorrect application of Rule 1.9(a) to the \ncurrent situation.  Rule 1.9(a) provides that \u201c[ a] lawyer who has formerly represented a client \nin a matter shall not represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person\u2019s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consen t, confirmed in writing.\u201d  M.R.C.P. Rule \n1.9(a).  Here, although Ms. Garrison became  a DDOJ employee in November 2013, she has \nnot \u201crepresented\u201d the State in any of Petitioner\u2019 s continuing criminal matters since that date.  \nTherefore, the failure to obtain Petitioner\u2019s wr itten consent is not relevant to the instant \nwaiver analysis.   \n \n5While not addressed by Petitioner, the Delaware FPDO\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to file a motion to disqualify the \nDDOJ may have been due to a reasoned determina tion that there was no c onflict of interest that \ncould form the basis of a meritorious motion for disqualification.  \n  9With regard to the last of the Conley  factors, the State would be prejudiced if the Delaware\u2019s \nAttorney General\u2019s Office is disqualified from cont inuing to represent the State in this matter.  \nDelaware\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office has been litigat ing the instant habeas case since 2014, devoting \nsignificant resources to drafting an extensive 21 6 page Answer to the Petition.  In addition, \nDelaware\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office has been in volved in all of Petiti oner\u2019s underlying state \ncriminal proceedings since 2002.  The State woul d suffer prejudice if the DDOJ was removed as \ncounsel at this juncture.  \nIn sum, after weighing the applicable factors, the Court concludes that Petitioner has waived \nhis conflict of interest claim and, theref ore, his grounds for disqualification. \nB. Imputation of Ms. Garrison\u2019s Conflict of Interest  \n \nThe  Parties agree that Ms. Garrison is pe rsonally disqualified from participating in \nPetitioner\u2019s state or federal post-conviction proceedi ngs occurring after November 2013.  (D.I. 95 at \n11; D.I. 95-1, at \u00b6 7;  D.I. 96 at 4)  Th ey disagree as to whether Ms. Garrison\u2019s personal \ndisqualification/conflict of interest can be imputed to the Delaware\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office.   \nThere \u201cis no rule or controlling authority that  compels the vicarious disqualification of a \nprosecutor\u2019s office based on an individual attorney\u2019s personal conflict,\u201d6 and neither the Third \nCircuit nor Delaware courts apply a per se conflict of interest rule.  See, e.g., Euell v. Rosemeyer , 153 \nF.R.D. 576, 578-79 (W.D. Pa. 19 93) (rejecting Federal Defender\u2019s motion to disqualify entire district \nattorney\u2019s office from representing Commonwealth in habeas proceeding, after noting that Pennsylvania\u2019s Rule of Professional Conduct 1.11 did not automatically require disqualification of \nother lawyers in agency in which lawyer in question has become associated); Hitchens v. State, 2007 \nWL 2229020, at *4 (Del. July 26, 1998) (noting lack of per se conflict of interest rule and declining to \n \n6United States v. Nosal , 2009 WL 482236, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2009.)   10find conflict of interest based on defense counse l, who had prosecuted defendant, representing \ndefendant in violation of probation proceeding after  leaving DDOJ).  Rather, courts in Delaware \nand the Third Circuit view disqualification as an  extreme remedy available only in limited \ncircumstances.  See United States v. Zagami , 374 F. App\u2019x 295, 297 (3d Ci r. 2010) (\u201cInstances in which \nthe courts have found it necessary to disqualify a particular United States Attorney are rare.\u201d); Harper \nv. Beacon Air, Inc ., 2017 WL 838224, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 2, 2017) (\u201c[D]isqualification of \ncounsel is an extreme remedy that should be employed only when necessary to ensure the fairness of the litigation process.\u201d).   Significantly,   \n[r]esolving the question of whether to disqualify counsel requires the \nCourt to carefully sift all the facts and circumstances.  Indeed, whether disqualification is appropriate depends on the facts of the case and is never automatic.  The required inquiry necessarily involves a painstaking analysis of the facts.  Furthermore, the Court approaches motions to disqualify counsel with cautious scrutiny, mindful of a litigant\u2019s right to the counsel of its choice.  \n Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. C heckpoint Software Techs. Ltd , 2011 WL 2692968, *4-6 (D. Del. June 22, \n2011) (cleaned up).    \nGiven the absence of any precedent squarely on point, the Court turns to the ABA\u2019s Model \nRules of Professional Conduct for initial guidance.  Ru le 1.11(d) of the M.R.P.C. governs conflicts of \ninterest for current government lawyers, and Rule  1.11(d)(1) provides that a current government \nlawyer \u201cis subject to Rules 1.7 [concerning confli cts of interest for current clients] and 1.9 \n[concerning duties to former clients].\u201d  Particular ly relevant to the instant issue is Comment 2 to \nRule 1.11, which provides:  \nRule 1.10 is not applicable to the c onflicts of interest addressed by this \nRule.  Rather, paragraph (b) sets forth a special imputation rule for former government lawyers that provides for screening and notice.   \nBecause of the special problems raised by imputation within a \ngovernment agency, [Rule 1.11(d)] does not impute the conflicts \nof a lawyer currently serving as  an officer or employee of the \ngovernment to other associat ed government officers or  11employees, although ordinarily it  will be prudent to screen such \nlawyers.  \n \nM.R.P.C. Rule 1.11 cmt. 2 (emphasis added).  Comment 11 to Rule 1.10 also addresses the \nimputation of a government lawyer\u2019s conflict of interest, providing that: \nUnder Rule 1.11(d), where a lawyer represents the government after \nhaving served clients in private practi ce . . ., former client conflicts are \nnot imputed to government lawyers associated with the individually disqualified lawyer.  \nM.R.P.C. Rule 1.10 cmt. 11  \nThe record in this case reveals that screening procedures were implemented when Ms. \nGarrison joined the DDOJ in November 2013, and the screening procedures successfully prevented \nthe disclosure of confidential information from Ms. Garrison to the DDOJ.  For instance, in her affidavit, Ms. Garrison explains that her supervisors at the DDOJ \nunderstood that [she] was prohibited from working on cases involving \n[her] prior clients, including [Peti tioner].  During [her] tenure with \nDDOJ, [she has] never discussed the substance of [her] representation of [Petitioner] with [her] coworker s or supervisors.  And, except for \nthe conversations outlined below, limited to discussions of [her] availability as a witness in these proceedings, neither [her] coworkers nor [her] supervisors have ever discussed the substance of [Petitioner\u2019s] case with her.  Additionally, [her] offices in Kent and Sussex County are physically separated from the New Castle County attorneys handling [Petitioner\u2019s] habeas case.   \n(D.I. 95-1 at 2)  Additionally, Petitioner does not a llege that Ms. Garrison revealed any confidential \ninformation to the DDOJ or that the DDOJ use d any confidential information Ms. Garrison \nacquired from Petitioner while she was his post-conviction counsel.  \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes th at the screening measures implemented upon \nMs. Garrison\u2019s employment with the DDOJ complie d with the requirements set forth in Comment \n2 to Rule 1.11.  Accordingly, there is no basi s under the M.R.P.C. for Ms. Garrison\u2019s personal \nconflict of interest to be imputed to the entire DDOJ in this case.     12Reviewing Petitioner\u2019s arguments under the gene ralized standards articulated in relevant \nDelaware and Third Circuit cases leads the Court to  the same conclusion.  For instance, the Third \nCircuit has determined that \u201c[t]he disqualification of Government counsel is a drastic measure and a court should hesitate to impose it except where necessary.\u201d  Zagami , 374 F. App\u2019x at 297.  While \nthere have been instances in which an entire pr osecutor\u2019s office has been disqualified in federal \ncourts, the weight of authority in the Third Circuit indicates that courts have generally declined to \ndisqualify an entire government agency from represen ting litigants in habeas proceedings where, as \nhere, attorneys who had formerly represented petitioners had adequately screened themselves from the matter and had avoided any actual impropriety.  See Euell v. Rosemeyer , 40 153 F.R.D. 576, 577 \n(W.D. Pa. 1993); Wright v. Lamas,  2019 WL 1496055, at *1, 4 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 29, 2019). \nSimilarly, under Delaware law, \u201cthe Court revi ewing the motion must weigh the effect of any \nalleged conflict on the fairness and integrity of th e proceedings before disqualifying the challenged \ncounsel.\u201d  Harper , 2017 WL 838224, at *3.  When assessi ng the alleged conflict\u2019s effect on the \nfairness of the proceeding, Delaware courts c onsider the extent of the challenged counsel\u2019s \ninvolvement in the movant\u2019s proceeding as well as whether there has been an exchange of confidential information.  See, e.g., IMC Global, Inc. v. Moffett , 1998 WL 842312, at *2-3 (Del. Ch. Nov. \n12, 1998) (declining to find threat to fairness of proceedings where, although exchange of information had taken place with contested firms, information did not strike court as \u201cnecessarily \nprivileged or particularly important from a fairne ss perspective to Plaintiff\u2019s litigation position\u201d); \nDollar Tree, Inc. v. Dollar Express LLC , 2017 WL 5624298, at *6-7 (Del. Ch. Nov. 21, 2017) (declining \nto find prejudice to fairness of proceedings where, inter alia , attorneys had not accessed information \nfrom matter in which firm had conflict, firm implemented ethical screen going forward, and \nattorneys in separate matter had no involvement in present litigation).    13When assessed under the foregoin g legal framework, Petitioner\u2019s arguments fail to establish  \nthat the DDOJ\u2019s continued repres entation of the State will prejudi ce the fairness and integrity of his \nhabeas proceeding.  Although he contends that Ms . Garrison\u2019s potential role as a witness in this \nproceeding warrants disqualifying the entire DDOJ as counsel for the State, Petitioner has not \nprovided any caselaw, legal rule, or written in stitutional ethical opinion to support his argument.7  \nPetitioner\u2019s primary concern appears to be his abili ty \u201cto investigate, interview, and call Ms. Garrison \nto testify on the issue of her representation of Petiti oner.\u201d  (D.I. 96 at 7-8)  Yet, the State\u2019s October \n1, 2021 letter addresses this concern and explicitly provides that  \n[t]he DDOJ appreciates that Ms. Garrison has ethical duties to \n[Petitioner] which may result in her being a witness in this case.  The DDOJ will not interfere with effort s by [Petitioner\u2019s] counsel to \ncommunicate with Ms. Garrison an d supports her cooperating with \ncounsel as she discharges those duties.  \n(D.I. 93 at 2)  Petitioner\u2019s argument that Ms. Garrison\u2019s potential role as a witness renders her an \nindividual with divided loyalties is rebutted by th e State\u2019s October 1, 2021 letter expressly providing \nthat the DDOJ understands Ms. Garrison\u2019s ethical duties and that she may be required to be a \nwitness. \n Petitioner\u2019s argument that Ms. Garrison will fa ce an \u201cimpossible dilemma\u201d if she is called as \na witness in this proceeding, due to her alleged competing professional and personal interests, also fails to demonstrate that the DDOJ\u2019s continued repr esentation will prejudice the fairness of the case.  \nThe \u201cimpossible dilemma\u201d identified by Petitioner is  not unique to a situation where, as here, a \npetitioner\u2019s former post-conviction counsel become s an employee of a government\u2019s prosecutorial \n \n7Petitioner has provided the \u201copinion of an estab lished legal ethics expert\u201d (Professor Abbe Smith) \nto support his argument.  (D.I. 94 at 5; D.I. 94 -2)  Whatever weight this opinion (which does not \nmention Rule 1.11 of the ABA\u2019s M.R.C.P. or Delaware\u2019s L.R.P.C.) should receive, it does not persuade the Court of a different ou tcome than that announced herein.  \n   14team.  As explained by the American Bar Associ ation (\u201cABA\u201d), the relationships between lawyers in \ngovernment agencies differ from those within private firms, because  \n[t]he salaried government employee do es not have the financial interest \nin the success of departmental representation that is inherent in private \npractice.  This important difference in the adversary posture of the \ngovernment lawyer is recognized by Canon 7: the duty of the public \nprosecutor to seek justice, not merely to convict, and the duty of all \ngovernment lawyers to seek just results rather than the result desired \nby a client.  The channeling of advocacy toward a just result as opposed \nto vindication of a particular claim lessens the temptation to \ncircumvent the disciplinary rules through the action of associates.  \nAccordingly, we construe DR 5-105(D) to be inapplicable to other \ngovernment lawyers associated with a particular government lawyer \nwho is himself disqualified by reason  of DR 4-101, DR 5-105, DR 9-\n101(B), or similar Disciplinary Rules.  \n \nABA, Committee on Ethics & Prof essional Responsibility, Formal Opinion # 342 (1975).  \n For all of these reasons, the Court conclu des Petitioner has failed to demonstrate a \ndisqualifying conflict of interest im putable to the entire DDOJ.   \nV.  CONCLUSION    For the reasons set forth above, the Court  will deny Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Disqualify the \nDDOJ from representing the State, both because (1) he waived any conflict of interest by failing to \nraise the issue in a timely manner; and (2) he has failed to demonstrate a disqualifying conflict of \ninterest imputable to the DDOJ.  A separate Order will be entered. \n          ________________________________  \nMarch 31, 2022     HONORABLE LEONARD P.
