(D.I. 14, 15, 16).  \nI. BACKGROUND1  \nAfter teaching as a visiting professor in 2013- 14, P laintiff Beth Vermeer, Ph.D. was hired \nas a tenure- track assistant professor in the Accounting and Management Information Systems \nDepartment  at the University of Delaware (the \u201cUniversity\u201d)  beginning the fall semester of 2014.  \n(D.I. 12 at \u00b6 11).   Around August 2014, Plaintiff brought concerns to Dr. Scott Jones, the then -\nDepartment Chair , concerning the actions of Jones and Dr. Jennifer Joe , a chaired professor in \nthe Department , in relation to committee \u201cgovernance..\u201d   (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 13 \u201316).  Jones then began to \nundermine Plaintiff\u2019s prospects for tenure at the University.  ( Id. at \u00b6 18).   For example, Jones \ntold Plaintiff , \u201cI hold the hammer,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re going to  make sure that you don\u2019t get tenure.\u201d  \n(Id. at \u00b6 24).  Jones also made several sex -based discriminatory comments to Plaintiff.  ( Id. at \n\u00b6\u00b6 20\u201321).   \nOn September 14, 2015, Plaintiff reported Jones\u2019 \u201cabuse, harassment , discrimination , and \nretaliation\u201d  to Dr. Bruce Weber, Dean of the College.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 34).   Weber told Plaintiff \nthat he would bring in an outside consultant to address the situation.  (Id. at \u00b6 37) .  Plaintiff \nlater heard that Weber was \u201csickened\u201d that he had to meet with Plaintiff and wanted her to leave \nthe University.  (Id. at \u00b6 38).   In 2017, Plaintiff reported  the ongoing discrimination and \nretaliation to the University\u2019s Deputy Title IX Coordina tor and Title IX Coordinator.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n49, 60). \n \n1 I state the facts as alleged by Plaintiff and in the light most favorable to h er. 2 On March 18, 2016, Plaintiff\u2019s contract was renewed for two years.  ( Id. at \u00b6 73).   \nIn 2017, a committee led by Joe introduced a \u201chigher \u201d Promotion and Tenure (\u201cP&T\u201d)  \nresearch standard  (the \u201c2017 P&T Standards\u201d) , which was approved by the Provost in May 2018.  \n(Id. at \u00b6 76).  Per  the Faculty Handbook, Plaintiff still had the right to be evaluated under the \n2006 P&T Standards, which were in place at the time of her hiring.  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 70\u201371).  On \nFebruary 9, 2018, the Department P&T Committee , chaired by Joe, renewed her contract and \n\u201cescalated \u201d the applicable research standard .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 77- 78).   Although the 2006 P&T \nStandards required public ations in \u201cquality and highly regarded refereed journals,\u201d the four -year \nrenewal letter \u201c\u2018 strongly advise[d] [Plaintiff] to submit her working papers for review and to \nmake concerted efforts to achieve publications in premier and premi er-plus journals.\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 \n79).  Th e language  in the renewal letter  was consistent with the 2017 P&T Standards.  (Id. at \u00b6 \n81). \nPlain tiff\u2019s process to decide whether she would be promoted and granted tenure began in \nMay 2019.  (Id. at \u00b6 87).  Plaintiff  asked Dean Weber to instruct  Jones and Joe to recuse \nthemselves  from that  process.   (Id.).  Weber ignored her request.  (Id. at \u00b6 88).  On September \n16, 2019, the Department P&T Committee  recommended by a vote of 7 -6 against approving \nPlaintiff\u2019s application for tenure.  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 105, 107) .  Jones and Joe, who served on the \nCommittee, \u201cheavily influenced\u201d the Committee \u2019s deliberations and vote .  (Id. at \u00b6 106) .  In \nPlaintiff\u2019s \u201cinitial appeal,\u201d Dr. Carolyn Levine, the then -Department Chair, denied the appeal on \nOctober 21, 2019, because Plaintiff had not achieved \u201cresearch excellence.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 111\u2013\n112).  On December 4, 2019, the Lerner College P&T Committee , by a 6- 3 vote, determined \nthat Plaintiff \u201c had met the requirements for tenure. \u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 118) . 3 On January 2, 2020, Dean Weber rejected the Lerner College P&T Committee\u2019s \nconclusion, reasoning that  Plaintiff \u2019s research was \u201cnot excellent\u201d because Plaintiff  had \u201cno \npublications in undisputed top- tier journals .\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 120 \u2013121).  Within a few days, Plaintiff \nappealed to Weber , asking that he  reconsider his decision, stating that she did have three \u201cTop-\nTier journal publications. \u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 122).  In response, on January 24, 2020, Weber again \n\u201cescalated \u201d the research standard, requiring Plaintiff to have  publications in \u201c premier (top six) \njournals  in accounting to meet the standard for research excellence. \u201d  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 123\u2013124) .  \u201cOn \nFebruary 14, 2020, the University P&T Committee (one level up from the [ Lerner] College P&T \nCommittee) unanimously overturned Weber\u2019s denial and voted in favor of [ Plaintiff\u2019s ] tenure. \u201d  \n(Id. at \u00b6 127).  The Universit y P&T Committee  applied the 2006 P&T Standards and agreed \nwith Plaintiff that \u201cthe \u2018goalposts\u2019 were unfairly mo ved\u201d by Weber.   (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 127\u2013128).  \nIn a brief letter on March 13, 2020, Provost Morgan rejected the University P&T \nCommittee\u2019s conclusions  and recommended denial of tenure.  (Id. at \u00b6 130 ).  Plaintiff appealed \nMorgan\u2019s \u201c initial recommendation. \u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 131) .  Plaintiff met with Morgan on April 15, \n2020, and reported the \u201cabuse, discrimination , and retaliation she had experienced ,\u201d both \ngenerally and in the tenure process .  (Id. at \u00b6 132).  On April 30, 2020, Morgan, relying on the \ndeterminations of Weber, Levine, and the Department P&T Committee, denied Plaintiff\u2019s final \nappeal regarding promotion and tenure.  (Id. at \u00b6 135) . \nOn March 24, 2020, while Plaintiff\u2019s appeal in her P&T process was  pending, Provost \nMorgan announced that \u201call probationary [tenure -track] faculty ( i.e., all who are in their first 6 \nyears) are granted a one- year extension to the tenure/contract clock.\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 138) .  The \nUniversity did not grant  Plaintiff this one -year extension.  (Id. at \u00b6 141).  Instead, on September 4 23, 2020, Plaintiff was notified that because she had not achieved tenure within six years, her \nemployment would be terminated on August 31, 2021.  ( Id.). \nOn February 4, 2022, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint  against the University , \nalleging discrimination under Title VII, Title IX, and the Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act ( \u201cDDEA\u201d ); retaliation under Title VII, Title IX , the DDEA, and the Equal Pay \nAct (\u201cEPA\u201d); violations of the EPA; breach of contract; and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  (D.I. 12).  The University has moved to dismiss all counts  for \nfailure to state a claim .  (D.I. 13).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nRule 8 requires a complainant to provide \u201ca short a nd plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).  Rule 12(b)(6) allows the \naccused party to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to meet this standard.  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well -pleaded allegations in the complaint \nas true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. T wombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \nThe factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than \nlabels, conclusions, or a \u201cformulaic recitation\u201d of the claim elements.  Id. at 555 (\u201cFactual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d).  \nMoreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief.  \nAshcroft v. I qbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when \nthe complaint\u2019s factual content \u201callows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the 5 defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Id. (\u201cWhere a complaint pleads  facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Sex and Gender  Discrimination  (Counts I , III, and VII)  \n \nPlaintiff brings  claims for sex discrimination under Title VII (Count I), sex  \ndiscrimination under the DDEA (Count III), and gender discrimination  under Title IX  (Count \nVII).  She alleges that the University discriminated against her, based on her se x and gender, \nwhen it denied her tenure.  To state a claim for sex discrimination under Title VII, Plaintiff must \nallege: \u201c (1) [she] is a member of a protected class; (2) [she] was qualified for the position [she] \nsought to attain or retain; (3) [she] suff ered an adverse employment action; and (4) the action \noccurred under circumstances that could give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.\u201d   \nMakky v. Chertoff , 541 F.3d 205, 214 (3d Cir. 2008) .2  \u201cA plaintiff need not convince the court \nof any of these elements at the motion to dismiss stage, but must submit more than [a] naked \nassertion that she  suffered an adverse employment action because of her  membership in a \nprotected class. \u201d  Blades  v. Mosaic  of Del., 2017 WL 3868238, at *6 (D. Del. Aug. 31, 2017)  \n(cleaned up) . \nThe University argues that  Plaintiff has f ailed to allege sufficient factual matter to \nsupport an inference that she was denied tenure because of her sex.   (D.I. 14 at 7).  To support \n \n2 The same standard  applies for Plaintiff\u2019s claims for sex discrimination under Title IX and the \nDDEA.  See Doe  v. Univ.  of Scis. , 961 F.3d 203, 209 (3d Cir. 2020)  (\u201c[T]o state a claim under \nTitle IX, the alleged facts, if true, must support a plausible inference that a federally -funded \ncollege or university discriminated against a person on the basis of sex.\u201d);  Hyland v.  Smyrna Sch.  \nDist. , 608 F. App\u2019 x 79, 83 n.5 (3d Cir. 2015)  (\u201c[T]he standards under Title VII and the DDEA \nare generally the same . . . .\u201d ). 6 an inference of intentional discrimination, P laintiff can show that similarly situated employees \noutside her protected class were treated more favorably.   \u201cTo be \u2018similarly  situated,\u2019  parties  \nmust  be \u2018alike  in all relevant  aspects.\u2019\u201d  Perano v. Twp. of  Tilden , 423 F. App\u2019x 234, 238 (3d \nCir. 2011) (quoting Startzell v.  City  of Phila ., 533 F.3d 183, 203 (3d Cir. 2008)) . \nPlaintiff alleges  that two male professors \u2014Dr. Dave Jenkins and Dr. Tom Vermeer \u2014\nwere treated more favorably than her.   Plaintiff alleges  that her research record was comparable \nto that of  Dr. Vermeer , who earned tenure in 2012, and was better than that of Dr. Jenkins, who \nearned tenure in 2008.  (D.I. 12 at  \u00b6 113).  Both professors earned tenure under the 2006 P&T \nStandards even though neither had a \u201cpremier (top six) \u201d publication.  ( Id. at \u00b6 125).  Th us, \nWeber\u2019s assertion , that Plaintiff needed \u201cpremier (top six) \u201d publications to meet the standard of \nresearch excel lence in the 2006 P&T Standards , was false.  ( Id. at \u00b6 124).   These factual \nallegations are sufficient to support the reasonable inference that these two male comparators \nwere similarly situated to Plaintiff  and received more favorable treatment  than she did.  See \nRodriguez  v. Wendover,  Inc, 2021 WL 2117205, at *3 (D. Del. May 25, 2021)  (\u201cBecause \n[Plaintiff]  has proffered  at least  one circumstance giving rise  to an inference of  intentional  \ndiscrimination,  she has stated  a plausible  claim  of sex discrimination.\u201d).  \nThe University argues , however  that since Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Vermeer earned tenure \noutside the applicable limitations period, their favorable treatment cannot support Plaintiff\u2019s \ndiscrimination claims.  (D.I. 14 at 10 \u201311 (citing Tabb v. Bd. of Educ. of Durham Pub. Schs ., \n2020 WL 5768853, at *20 ( M.D.N.C. Sept. 28, 2020), aff\u2019d , 29 F.4th 148 (4th Cir. 2022); \nEklecCo NewCo LLC v. Town of Clarkstown , 2019 WL 2210798, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, \n2019) ; Colley v. Waste Mgmt. of Ala., Inc., 2001 WL 228058, at *3 (S.D. Ala. Feb. 7, 2001)) ).  I \ndisagree.  7 Plaintiff\u2019s discrimination claims arise from the  University\u2019s denial of her tenure \u2014an act \nthat undisputedly occurred within the limitations period.  Evidence about how Plaintiff\u2019s  male \ncomparators were treated is relevant to the issue of whether this denia l of tenure was based on \nPlaintiff\u2019s sex .  The fact that the favorable treatment of her  male comparators falls outside the \nlimitations period is  not a reason to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s timely -filed claims.   See Brinkley -Obu v. \nHughes  Training, Inc. , 36 F.3d 336, 346 (4th Cir. 1994)  (\u201cStatutes of limitations do not operate \nas an evidentiary bar controlling the evidence admissible at the trial of a timely -filed cause of \naction.\u201d ).  I therefore conclude that Plaintiff can rely on favorable treatment outside the \nlimitations period to support her discrimination claims.  Cf. Vereen  v. Woodland Hills  Sch. Dist. , \n2008 WL 794451, at *23 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 24, 2008)  (\u201c[Plaintiff] may,  however, use  male  \nemployees  employed by the School  District prior  to the limitations  period as  comparators  for \npurposes  of establishing  her prima  facie case [under  the Equal  Pay Act] .\u201d). \nPlaintiff has alleged sufficient factual matter to support an inference that sh e was denied \ntenure because of her sex .  Thus, I deny the motion to dismiss Counts I, III,3 and VII.  \nB. Family Responsibilities and Mar ital Status Discrimination  (Count s V and \nVI) \n \nPlaintiff brings claims under the DDEA for discrimination based on family \nresponsibilities (Count V) and marital status (Count VI).  Under the DDEA, it is an unl awful \nemployment practice for an employer \u201c to discharge any individual  or otherwise  to discriminate \nagainst any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of \n \n3 The University argues that Plaintiff\u2019s DDEA claim must be dismissed because Plaintiff cannot \nmaintain a claim under both Title VII and the DDEA.  (D.I. 14 at 7 n.6).  As I have previously \nacknowledged, the law is unsettled as to whether a plaintiff can proceed under both Title VII and \nthe DDEA.  Wooten v. City of Wilmington, 2021 WL 411707, at *7 (D. Del. Feb. 5, 2021).  \nThus, I will allow Plaintiff\u2019s claims under both Title VII and the DDEA to proceed.  Id.  8 employment because of such individual\u2019s . . . mar ital status \u201d or \u201cfamily responsibilities .\u201d4  D EL. \nCODE ANN. tit. 19, \u00a7 711(a)(1) & (k)(1)(a).  \nPlaintiff alleges that the University discriminated against her , based on her family \nresponsibilities  and marital status , when it denied her tenure.  The University argues that \nPlaintiff has failed to allege circumstances giving rise to an inference of intentional \ndiscrimination.  (D.I. 14 at 7\u20138 & n. 7).  The Complaint does not identify any comparators outside of Plaintiff\u2019s protected class for her family responsibilities and marital status claim s.\n5  \n(See generally D.I. 12).  Instead, Plaintiff argues  that certain statements made by Joe, Levine, \nand Jones support an inference of discrimination.  (D.I. 15 at 17\u201318).  \nFor example, soon after Plaintiff and Joe  met, Joe told Plaintiff that she would need a \nfull-time nanny if she wanted to be taken seriously.  ( D.I. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 66\u201367).  In the fall of 2018, \nLevine mocked Plaintiff for bringing brownies to the office, as Levine did not have time to bake \nbecause she had a \u201creal job\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t have time for that nonsense.\u201d6  (Id. at \u00b6 68).   Jones \nrepeatedly told Pla intiff that her husband was the \u201cmajor breadwinner,\u201d that Plaintiff could \n \n4 The DDEA defines \u201cfamily responsibilities\u201d as \u201cthe obligations of an employee to care for any \nfamily member who would qualify as a covered family member under the Family and Medical \nLeave Act.\u201d  D EL. CODE ANN. tit. 19, \u00a7 710(9).  \n \n5 Plaintiff alleges that she was paid less than similarly situated employees who  did not have \nfamily responsibilities or who  were not married.  (D.I. 12 at \u00b6 \u00b6 222, 231).  Plaintiff , however, \ndoes not allege any facts identifying sp ecific unmarried comparators  without family \nresponsibilities who were paid more than Plaintiff .  These conclusory allegations are thus \ninsufficient.  See Perano , 423 F. App\u2019x at 238 (\u201c At the motion to dismiss stage, [Plaintiff] must \nallege facts sufficient to make plausible the existence of such similarly situated parties. \u201d). \n \n6 I assume for present purposes that this is a comment on family responsibilities, although it \nseems more like just a silly comment.  \n 9 always \u201cfall back\u201d on her husband, and \u201cthat her role as a mother of four daughters made her \ncareer inferior.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 69).  \n Levine, Joe, and Jones did not make the  ultimate  decision to deny Plaintiff tenure, \nMorgan did.  Thus, t hese stray comments alone are insufficient to support an inference that \nMorgan\u2019s decision to deny tenure was based on Plaintiff\u2019s family responsibilities  or her status as \na married person .  See Ezold v.  Wolf,  Block,  Schorr  & Solis -Cohen, 983 F.2d 509, 545 (3d Cir. \n1992) (\u201c Stray  remarks  by non- decisionmakers  . . . are rarely  given great  weight, particularly  if \nthey were made temporally  remote  from  the date of  decision .\u201d); Cridland v.  Kmart  Corp., 929 F. \nSupp. 2d 377, 389 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (\u201c Under Third Circuit precedent, \u2018stray remarks\u2019 unconnected \nfrom an adverse employment decision are insufficient to show invidious purpose.\u201d).  \n Yet, Plaintiff argues that there are sufficient allegations supporting an inference that \nMorgan\u2019s decision was based on Plaintiff\u2019s family responsibilities  or marital status  under the \n\u201ccat\u2019s paw \u201d doctrine.  (D.I. 15 at 14, 17\u201318) .  Under the \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory , an employer is \nliable for discrimination w hen \u201ca non -biased decision -maker  is influenced by a biased \nmanagerial employee. \u201d  Carter  v. Midway  Slots  & Simulcast , 894 F. Supp. 2d 529, 543 (D. Del. \n2012), aff \u2019d, 511 F. App\u2019 x 125 (3d Cir. 2013) .  Specifically, \u201c[I]f a supervisor performs an act \nmotivated by [discriminatory] animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable [.]\u201d  Staub v.  Proctor  Hosp. , 562 U.S. 411, 422 (2011)  (footnote omitted).  \nPlaintiff argues that Morgan\u2019s tenure decision  was influenced by the discriminatory \nanimus of Weber, Jones, Joe, and Levine because Morgan relied on the reports of Weber, \nLevine, and the Depar tment P&T Committee.  (D.I. 15 at 14).  There are no allegations, \nhowever, supporting an  inference that the reports of Weber, Levine, and the Department P&T 10 Committee were motivated by a discriminatory animus  towards Plaintiff\u2019s family responsibilities  \nor status as a married person .   \nAlthough Levine, Joe, and Jones made certain discriminatory comments regarding \nPlaintiff\u2019s family responsibilities  and marital status , these comments were isolated and were \nmade over a period of several years prior to the denial of Plaintiff\u2019s tenure.  T hus, t hese \ncomments alone are insufficient to support an inference that the reports of Weber, Levine, and \nthe Department P&T Committee were based on family responsibilit ies or mar ital status  \ndiscrimination.   See Hyland v.  Am. Int\u2019l Grp. , 360 F. App\u2019 x 365, 367\u201368 (3d Cir. 2010) (finding \nthat a supervisor\u2019s \u201cstray remark made ten months before [the plaintiff]\u2019s termination\u201d in which \nthe supervisor referred to the plaintiff as the  \u201cold man\u201d did \u201cnot support an inference of age \ndiscrimination underlying [the plainti ff]\u2019s termination\u201d) ; Ezold , 983 F.2d at 545 (\u201c Stray remarks \n. . . by decisionmakers unrelated to the decision process are rarely given great weight, \nparticularly if they were made temporally remote from the date of decision.\u201d ).  Accordingly, I \nfind that th e factual allegations do not support liability under the cat\u2019s paw theory.  \nPlaintiff  has therefore failed to plead sufficient allegations supporting an inference that \nPlaintiff was denied tenure because of her family responsibilities or status as a married person.  \nFor her marital status discrimination claim, Plaintiff argues  that she also suffered \ndiscrimination based on her spouse\u2019s identi ty (rather than her status as a married person) .  (D.I. \n15 at 18).  Plaintiff\u2019s husband, Dr. Tom Vermeer, was a tenure d professor in the same \ndepartment.  (D.I. 12 at \u00b6 23).  Plaintiff alleges that Jones and Weber  disliked Dr. Tom Vermeer \nand conspire d to deny Plaintiff tenure \u201cso she and Tom will leave\u201d  the University.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 33, \n56\u201358).   I do not think that the identity of Plaintiff\u2019s spouse  supports a DDEA marital status 11 discrimination claim.  Plaintiff\u2019s marriage to Tom Vermeer is not a protected characteristic  \n(apart from Plaintiff\u2019s status as a married person).  \nPlaintiff argues that in Kenny  v. Univ ersity  of Delaware , 2018 WL 1022576 (D. Del. Feb. \n22, 2018) , this Court indicated that the identity of the  plaintiff\u2019s  spouse is relevant to a claim of \nmarital discrimination under the DDEA .  (D.I. 15 at 18\u201319).  In Kenny , however, the identity of \nthe plaintiff\u2019s  spouse was relevant because plaintiff was married to a person of the same gender.   \nKenny , 2018 WL 1022576, at *5.  That is not the case here.   \nFor the above reasons , I will grant the motion to dismiss Counts V and VI.  \nC. Retaliation (Counts II, IV, VIII, and X)  \nPlaintiff brings four claims for retaliation under Title VII  (Count II) , the DDEA (Count \nIV), Title IX  (Count VIII), and the  Equal Pay Act  (\u201cEPA \u201d) (Count X).  She alleges that the \nUniversity retaliated against her for reporting sex  discrimination when it denied her tenure. (D.I. \n15 at 16). To state a claim for retaliation , Plai ntiff must allege  that: (1) she engaged in a \nprotected activity; \u201c(2) the employer took an adverse employment action against her ; and (3) \nthere was a causal connection between h er participation in the protected activity and the adverse \nemployment action.\u201d  Moore v. City of Phila., 461 F.3d 331, 340\u201341 (3d Cir. 2006) (citation \nomitted)  (Title VII); Doe  v. Mercy Cath. Med.  Ctr., 850 F.3d 545, 564 (3d Cir. 2017) (Title IX); \nWooten v.  City  of Wilmington , 2021 WL 411707, at *7 (D. Del. Feb. 5, 2021) (DDEA); Shawley  \nv. Jim Shorkey  1 White  Oak,  LLC , 2022 WL 1539957, at *15 (W.D. Pa. May 16, 2022) (EPA) . \nThe University argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege that she was denied tenure \nbecause she complain ed about sex, marital status, or family responsibility discrimination or her  \nunequal  pay.  (D.I. 14 at 12\u201313).  I agree.  For purposes of this motion, I assume that Provost \nMorgan\u2019s final April 30, 2020 denial of Plaint iff\u2019s tenure application and the University\u2019s failure  12 to grant Plaintiff the one -year contract extension are both actionable adverse actions.  Plaintiff \nhas failed to allege any facts suppor ting a causal link between her complaints of discrimination \nand these adverse actions.  \nMorgan issued her initial denial of tenure on March 13, 2020.  ( D.I. 12 at \u00b6 130).  \nPlaintiff first reported the discrimination to Morgan during an appeal meeting on April 15, 2020.  \n(Id. at \u00b6 132).  There are no allegations that Morgan was aware of Plaintiff\u2019s  previous \ncomplaints of discrimination.  Accordingly, Plaintiff\u2019s April 15, 2020 complaint could not have \nmotivated Morgan\u2019s initial decision to deny tenure.  Ambrose  v. Twp. of  Robinson, 303 F.3d \n488, 493 (3d Cir. 2002)  (\u201cIt is only intuitive that for prote cted conduct to be a substantial or \nmotiving factor in a decision, the decisionmakers must be aware of the protected conduct.\u201d ).  \nPlaintiff has  therefore  failed to plausibly allege that her complaint of discrimination was the but -\nfor cause of  Morgan\u2019s deni al of Plaintiff\u2019s appeal of Morgan\u2019s March 13, 2020 decision.  That \nPlaintiff then told Morgan about the history of discrimination and retaliation while arguing for  \nMorgan to change her decision does not provide a basis by itself to infer that Morgan\u2019s  \nconsistent final decision was the but -for cause of the final denial.     \nThe same is true for the University\u2019s failure to grant Plaintiff a one -year contract \nextension.  There are no allegations in the complaint supporting an inference that Plainti ff was \ndenied this extension because she complained about discrimination.  The only reasona ble \ninference suggested by the complaint is that she was denied this extension because she was  \ndenied tenure.  ( See D.I. 12 at \u00b6 141).  \nBecause Plaintiff has not plau sibly alleged a causal link between the se adverse actions \nand her complaints of discrimination, I will grant the motion to dismiss Counts II, IV, VIII, and X. 13 D. Unequal Pay  under the EPA  (Count IX)  \nThe University argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a c laim under the EPA.   (D.I. 14 at \n14\u201316).  T o state  a valid  EPA  claim,  Plaintiff  must  assert  that \u201can employer  pays  different  \nwages  to employees  of opposite  sexes  \u2018for equal  work  on jobs  the performance of  which  requires  \nequal  skill,  effort,  and responsibility, and  which  are performed  under  similar  working \nconditions.\u2019\u201d   Corning Glass  Works  v. Brennan, 417 U.S.  188, 195 (1974)  (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n206(d)(1) ). \nPlaintiff  alleges  that she was paid  less than  \u201ctwo  similarly  situated  untenured male  faculty  \nin her department\u201d \u2014Dr.  Mike  Jung and  Dr. Nir Yehuda.  (D.I.  12 at  \u00b6 119) .  She  alleges  that \nthese two  \u201cmale comparators\u201d  had \u201cequal  work  in terms  of skill,  effort,  and responsibility.\u201d   (Id. \nat \u00b6 269).  These allegations,  however, are conclusory and  do not  equate to  more  than  a \nrecitation  of the elements  of an EPA  claim.   See,  e.g., Gumbs  v. Del. Dep \u2019t of Lab., 2015 WL \n3793539, at *3 (D. Del. June 17, 2015)  (granting a  motion to dismiss a complaint containing \nsimilar allegations) .  Thus,  I will grant  the motion  to dismiss  Count  IX.  \nE. Breach of Contract (Counts XI, XII, and XIII)  \nTo sta te a claim for breach of contract, Plaintiff must plead: (1) the existence of a \ncontract; (2) the breach of an obligation imposed by the contract; and (3) resulting damage.  \nVLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett -Packard Co., 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del. 2003) . \nPlaintiff brings  three breach of contract claims .  Count XI alleges that the University \nbreached Plaintiff\u2019s employment agreement \u201c[b]y failing to adhere to the policies regarding research standards for [Plaintiff] \u2019s tenure and promotion evaluation as required by her \nemployment agreement and the Faculty Handbook.\u201d  (D.I. 12 at \u00b6  284) .  Count XII alleges  that \nthe University breached the employment agreement \u201c[b]y failing to adhere to the appropriate 14 policies regarding academic freedom, and for retaliating ag ainst [Plaintiff] \u2019s exercise of \nacademic freedom by determining to deny her tenure and promotion.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 289).  Count \nXIII alleges that the University  breached its obligations under the Faculty Handbook and the \nMarch 24 Announcement by fail ing to grant Plaintiff the one -year contract extension it promised \nto tenure -track faculty members.  ( Id. at \u00b6 295).  \nThe University first argues that Plaintiff has failed to identify the \u201cspecific and definite\u201d \nprovisions of her employment agreement that have been br eached.  (D.I. 14 at 16\u201317).  I \ndisagree.  The Complaint  does identify the contractual provisions that have been breached:  \nFaculty Handbook \u00a7 4.4.13 (research standards)  (D.I. 12 at \u00b6  70), Faculty Handbook \u00a7 4.2.1 \n(academic freedom) (id. at \u00b6 288) , and the Provost\u2019s March 24, 2020 contract extension \nannouncement ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 138, 292) . \nPlaintiff\u2019s employment contract incorporates the Faculty Handbook by reference .  The \ncontract states, \u201cSeparate and apart from your annual performance apprai sal, you will be \nevaluated through peer review regarding your progress t oward  tenure, according to the \nprocedures set forth in the Handbook for Faculty and in College and Department promotion and \ntenure policies and procedures.\u201d   (D.I. 12- 1, Ex. B, at 1; s ee also id. (\u201cYour employment will be \ngoverned by all applicable University policies and procedures  . . . .\u201d) ).  Under Delaware law, \n\u201cWhere a contract is executed which refers to another instrument and makes the conditions of \nsuch other instrument a part of it, the two will be interpreted together as the agreement of the \nparties. \u201d  Lipson v.  Anesthesia  Servs.,  P.A. , 790 A.2d 1261, 1278 (Del. Super. Ct.  2001) .  \nAccordingly, Plaintiff\u2019s employment contract with the University includes the r ights and \nobligations set forth in the Faculty Handbook.  See  Golovan v.  Univ.  of Del., 73 F. Supp. 3d 15 442, 453 & n.2 (D. Del. 2014) (holding, based on the same language, that the Faculty Handbook \nwas incorporated by reference in plaintiff\u2019s employment agreement).  \n1. Impermissible \u201cEscalation \u201d of Research Standards ( Count XI ) \nSection 4.4.13 of the Faculty Handbook provides , \u201cThose faculty who are candidates for \npromotion and/or tenure . . . have  the right to be reviewed under the policy and procedure in \nforce at the time of hiring, rather than  under any revised policy or procedure subsequently \nadopted.\u201d   (D.I. 12- 1, Ex. C, \u00a7 4.4.13).  In Count XI, Plaintiff claims  that the University \nbreached this section when it evaluated her research under the \u201cescalated \u201d 2017 P&T Standards , \ninstead of the 2006 P&T Standards  in place when she was hired .  (See D.I. 12 at  \u00b6\u00b6 71, 120, 130, \n284).  Plaintiff alleges that the University first raised  the applicable research standard  on \nFebruary 9, 2018, when the P&T Committee issued the four -year renewal letter .  (Id. at \u00b6 78).  \nThe University argues  (in a footnote)  that Count XI  is time -barred  because this breach falls \noutside of the  three -year statute of limitations .7  (D.I. 14 at 17 n.14) ; GRT,  Inc. v. Marathon GTF  \nTech.,  Ltd., 2011 WL 2682898, at *6 (Del. Ch. July 11, 2011) ( \u201cThe three- year period typically  \nbegins  to run when  the contract  is breached,  whether  or not the plaintiff  was aware of  such  \nbreach.\u201d).  \nPlaintiff responds that the 2018 renewal letter was not the only violation, a nd the \nUniversity continued the \u201cescalation \u201d of the  research standard s throughout her tenure process.  \n(D.I. 15 at 8 n.6).  For example , Web er raised  the research standard in January 2020 when he \nrejected the conclusion of the College P&T Committee and declined to recommend tenure .  \n(D.I. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 120\u2013128).  In overturning Weber\u2019s denial, the  University P&T Committee \n \n7 Plaintiff filed her initial Complaint on October 25, 2021.  (D.I. 1).  16 acknowledged that Weber \u201cunfairly moved\u201d the \u201cgoalposts .\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 128).  Plaintiff also \nalleges that Provost Morgan improperly raised  the research standard  when making her final \ndecision denying tenure  on April 30, 2020.  ( Id. at \u00b6 135) . \nThese incidents  are separate breaches and fall within the limitations period .  Thus, I deny \nthe motion to dismiss Count XI.  \n2. Violation of Academic Freedom Rights ( Count XII ) \nCount XII is based on the Univ ersity\u2019s breach of Section 4.2.1 of the Faculty Handbook.  \nSection 4.2.1 provides : \nAcademic freedom is indispensable to effective teaching, excellent  research/creative \nactivities, exemplary service, and shared  governance. Academic freedom is the right of \nfaculty to examine  and discuss all questions of interest to them, and to teach, publish, \npresent, and speak, without  censorship or external interference,  even though their \nconclusions may be unpopular or contrary to public opinion (see 3.1.1). . . . Academic \nfreedom also  encompasses the freedom to discuss any matte r of institutional policy or \npractice, without institutional sanction.  \n \n(D.I. 12- 1, Ex. C, \u00a7 4.2.1). \nThe University argues that  this language  does not create any binding contractual \nobligation because it does not identify \u201ca single definite, specific, and clear undertaking by the \nUniversity with respect to Plaintiff .\u201d  (D.I. 14 at 17\u201319).  I agree.   This section merely defines \nacademic freedom  and does not create any specific and definite obligations on behalf of the \nUniversity.  See Vurimindi  v. Fuqua Sch. of  Bus. , 435 F. App\u2019 x 129, 133\u201334  (3d Cir. 2011)  \n(affirming the dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claim based on the college\u2019s ge neral \nanti-harassment policy because this policy simply presented the college\u2019s view that harassment is \nunacceptable) ; see also BAE Sys.  Info. &  Elec.  Sys. Integration, Inc.  v. Lockheed  Martin  Corp., \n2009 WL 264088, at *4 (Del. Ch. Feb. 3, 2009) (\u201c Delaware courts will not enforce an agreement \nthat is indefinite as to any material or essential term.\u201d).  17 I therefore grant the motion to dismiss  Count XII.  \n3. Breach of Agreement to Extend Contract ( Count XIII ) \nIn Count XIII, Plaintiff claims that the University breached its contract by failing to grant \nPlaintiff a one -year contract extension.  The parties disagree as to whether Plaintiff was  entitled \nto the one -year contract extension granted in Provost  Morgan\u2019s  March 24, 2020 announcement.  \nThe University argues that Plaintiff was denied tenure on March 13, 2020, so she was not \n\u201ctenure -track faculty\u201d on March 24, 2020 and thus was not entitled to the extension.  (D.I. 1 4 at \n19).8  Plaintiff argues that the Provost\u2019s March 13 letter was \u201can initial recommendation of \ntenure denial\u201d and the tenure process was not complete until the Provost issued her final decision \nafter appeal  on April 30, 2020.  (D.I. 15 at 11).  \nThe Un iversity\u2019s argument requires this Cour t to interpret the relevant provisi ons of the \nFaculty Handbook to determine whether Plaintiff was  a \u201ctenure- track faculty\u201d member as of \nMarch 24, 2020.  This inquiry is not suitable to resolution on a motion to dismiss  and is more \namenable to a determination at  the summary judgment stage .  See Universal  Am. Corp. v.  \nPartners  Healthcare  Sols. Holdings, L.P. , 61 F. Supp. 3d 391, 400 (D. Del. 2014) .  Thus, I deny \nthe motion  to dismiss Count XIII.  \nF. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Count XIV)  \nTo state a clai m for breach of the  implied covenant  of good faith and fair dealing, \nPlaintiff must allege: \u201c a specific implied contractual obligation, a breach of that obligation by the \n \n8 In its reply brief, the University also argues that the March 24, 2020 announcement  is not an \nenforceable contract.  (D.I. 16 at 2\u20133).  The extension announcement appears to have been \nunilateral.  Plaintiff, though, has had no opportunity to respond to the argument.  Since the  \nargument was raised  for the first time in the reply brief , I will not consider it here.  See Sprint  \nCommc \u2019ns Co. L.P.  v. Cequel  Commc \u2019ns, LLC , 2022 WL 609213, at *3 (D. Del. Jan. 27, 2022); \nD. Del. L R 7.1.3(c)(2).  18 defendant, and resulting damage to the plaintiff.\u201d   MHS  Cap. LLC  v. Goggin, 2018 WL \n2149718, at *11 (Del. Ch. May 10, 2018) . \nIn Delaware, the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is a \u201climited and \nextraordinary legal  remedy,\u201d which only \u201crequires a party in a contractual relationship to refrain \nfrom arbitrary or unreasonable conduct which has the effect of preventing the other party to the \ncontract from receiving the fruits  of the bargain.\u201d   Nemec v. Shrader , 991 A.2d 1120, 1128 (Del. \n2010) .  The  implied  covenant  of good faith and fair dealing cannot be used by a party to expand \nits contract rights where the contract speaks to that party\u2019s rights.  Allied  Cap. Corp. v.  GC-Sun \nHoldings , L.P. , 910 A.2d 1020, 1032 (Del. Ch. 2006) (\u201c [I]mplied  covenant  analysis will only be \napplied when the contract is truly silent with respect to the matter at hand  . . . .\u201d).  \nTo determine whether the implied  covenant  applies, the Court must first determine \nwhether there is a contractual gap.  If a contractual gap exists, the Court must \u201c consider whether \nimplied contractual terms fill the gap.\u201d  MHS , 2018 WL 2149718, at  *12.  To do this , the Court \ndetermines \u201cwhether  it is clear  from  what  was expressly  agreed  upon that  the parties  who  \nnegotiated  the express  terms  of the contract  would have  agreed  to proscribe  the act later  \ncomplained  of as a breach  of the implied  covenant  of good faith \u2014had  they  thought  to negotiate  \nwith respect  to that matter .\u201d  Id. \nPlaintiff alleges that the University violated its implied covenant against family bias  \nwhen it denied her tenure because she was married to Tom Vermeer .  (See D.I. 12 at \u00b6 299).  \nSection 4.2.10 of the Faculty Handbook states, \u201c [A]ll faculty should avoid real or apparent  \nconflict of interest, coercion, favoritism, or bias  by not serving in evaluative roles involving \nsomeone who is an immediate family member.\u201d   (D.I. 12- 1, Ex. C, \u00a7 4.2.10) .  Plaintiff argues 19 that this anti -nepotism policy contains an implied obligation prohibiting tenure denials motivated \nby bias against an immediate family member .  (D.I. 15 at 10).  \nThe Complaint , however,  does not include any allegations which woul d justify implying \nthis contract term.  See Nemec, 991 A.2d at 1126  (\u201c[Courts ] will only imply contract terms when \nthe party asserting the implied covenant proves that the other party has acted arbitrarily or \nunreasonably, thereby frustrating the fruits of the bargain that the asserting party reasonably \nexpected.\u201d).   Notably, t he Faculty Handbook contains many policies and procedures governing \nthe promotion and tenure process.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 12 -1, Ex. C, \u00a7\u00a7 4.4.1, 4.4.3).   These policies \nspecify  the relevant considerations for a promotion decision\u2014i.e., that the tenure decision should \nbe based on the merits.  ( See id. , \u00a7 4.4.3).  Because the contract is not truly silent with respect \nto the matter at hand, the implied covenant does not apply in this case.  \nI therefore grant the University\u2019s motion to dismiss Count XIV.  \nIV.
