I heard oral argument on November 22, 2022.  As announced from the bench, \nI recommend that Defendant \u2019s motion be GRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART.    \nI. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201c To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018 state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201c factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged. \u201d  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.  \u201cWhere \na complaint pleads facts that are \u2018 merely consistent with \u2019 a defendant \u2019s liability, it \u2018 stops short of 2 \n the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief. \u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 557). \n In determining the sufficiency of the complaint, I must assume all \u201c well-pleaded facts \u201d are \ntrue but need not assume the truth of legal conclusions.  Id. at 679.   \u201c[W]hen the allegations in a \ncomplaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency \nshould be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d   Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (quotation omitted). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nMy report and recommendation on Defendant \u2019s Motion to Dismiss was announced from \nthe bench at the conclusion of the hearing as follows:   \nPlaintiff Digney York Associates, LLC  (\u201cDigney York\u201d)  \nfiled this action on April  1, 2022 against D efendant Jay S. Weiss  \n(\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cWeiss\u201d) .  After Weiss filed a motion to dismiss, \nDigney York and Plaintiff Elkay Interior Systems International, Inc. \n(\u201cElkay\u201d) ( collectively , with Digney York, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) , filed an \namended  complaint, which I \u2019ll refer to as the FAC.\n0F1  The FAC \nasserts claims for breach of contract, tortious interference  with \ncontract, tortious interference with  prospective business relations, \nunfair  competition, and trade secret  misappropriation under the \nDelaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act.  \nAccording to the FAC, \u201c Plaintiffs are industry leaders  in the \nbusiness of renovating hotel  interiors and similarly situated  \nproperties.\u201d 1F2  In December 2019, Elkay entered into a stock \npurchase agreement  (\u201cSPA\u201d) with the stockholders of Digney  \nHoldings, Inc., including Weiss and the  seller representative. 2F3  \nThrough the SPA, Elkay purchased Digney Holdings, Inc. as  well \n \n1 (D.I. 11 (\u201cFAC\u201d) .) \n \n2 (Id. \u00b6 7.)  \n \n3 (Id. \u00b6 9.)  3 \n as its subsidiaries, including Digney York. 3F4  Before entering into the \nSPA, Weiss  was CEO and  Chairman of Digney York. 4F5  \nThe SPA contains non- compete,  non-solicitation, and \nconfidentiality  provisions. 5F6  The non- compete provision is  in \nsection 6.4(a), which states in pertinent  part as follows: \u201c Each \nSeller, \u201d which no one here disputes includes Weiss, \u201c shall  not, for a \nperiod from the C losing Date until the five  (5) year anniversary of \nthe Closing Date, directly or indirectly , own,  manage, operate, \ncontrol, invest in, or  participate in the ownership, management,  \noperati on, or control of , any Person  engaged in the B usiness in the \nUnited  States. \u201d 6F7  The SPA defines the word \u201cPerson \u201d to include \nindividuals and businesses. 7F8  The SPA defines \u201c Business \u201d as \u201cthe \nbusiness of acting as a general  contractor for the renovation of hotel  \ninteriors and similarly structured  properties, including with respect \nto pre-planning services, process management  and product \nprocurement, in each cas e acting in the capacity as a general  \ncontractor or subcontractor.\u201d 8F9   \nSection 6 .4(b) prohibits Weiss  from directly or indirectly \nsoliciting  Digney York\u2019 s customers or employees for a  period of \nthree years, and section 6.4(e)  prohibits him from disclosing or using \nDigney York\u2019 s confidential information for  the purpose of engaging \nin the hotel  renovation business. 9F10  In section 6. 4(d), the parties  \nagreed  that irreparable injury would result  to Elkay as buyer and \nDigney York as a  company entity in the event of a breach of  section \n \n4 (Id.) \n \n5 (Id. \u00b6 10.)  \n \n6 (D.I. 8, Ex. A  (SPA)  \u00a7 6.4; FAC \u00b6\u00b6  9\u201350.)  As the SPA is explicitly relied upon in the \nFAC, the Court may consider it  when ruling on the motion to dismiss .  In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997).     \n \n7 (D.I. 8, Ex. A  \u00a7 6.4(a) .) \n \n8 (Id. \u00a7 1)  \n \n9 (Id.) \n \n10 (Id. \u00a7 6.4( b), (e). ) \n 4 \n 6.4. 10F11  The parties also agreed that Elkay would be entit led to \ninjunctive  relief for any breach of any provision of  section 6.4. 11F12 \nThe FAC alleges that in March  2022, Plaintiff s accessed a \nwebsite for a company called Broad Avenue Construction located in \nFlorida. 12F13  Screenshots of [the]  website are attached as Exhibit A to \nthe FAC.  The website advertised Broad Avenue  as specializing in \nthe business of hotel  renovations. 13F14  It stated that its services  \nincluded, among other things, preconstruction services, construction \nmanagement, includi ng subcontractor  management, and \nrenovations. \n14F15  It listed  Weiss as a \u201cP rincipal \u201d of Broad Avenue. 15F16  \nThe website also contained a biography of  Weiss , which described \nBroad Avenue as \u201c made possible through Jay Weiss.\u201d 16F17 \nThe FAC further alleges that  the Broad Avenue website \ncontained  sixteen  photographs of Digney York\u2019 s past projects  and \nrepresented that those projects were completed by Broad Avenue. 17F18  \nIt further alleges that Broad Avenue\u2019 s website  featured an exact \nplagiarized copy of  Digney York\u2019 s \u201cServices \u201d page. 18F19  According \nto the FAC, after Weiss was served with the original complaint, \ncertain portions of  the website were changed to say \u201c under  \nconstruction.\u201d 19F20 \nIn the FAC \u2019s first claim for  breach of contract, Plaintiff s \nallege that  Weiss breached the non -compete, non-solicitation, and \n \n11 (Id. \u00a7 6.4(d) .) \n \n12 (Id.)   \n \n13 (FAC  \u00b6 21 , Ex. A .) \n \n14 (Id. \u00b6 23 .)   \n \n15 (Id. \u00b6 23 , Ex. A .) \n \n16 (Id. \u00b6 21 , Ex. A .) \n \n17 (Id. \u00b6 25 , Ex. A .) \n \n18 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30, 32.)  \n \n19 (Id. \u00b6 31.)  \n \n20 (Id. \u00b6 23.)  5 \n confidentiality  provisions set forth in section 6.4 of the  SPA.  Weiss \nmaintains that the breach of  contract claim should be dismissed. \nHe first argues that any  claim by Plaintiff  Digney York for \nbreach  of contract should be dismissed under  Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1)  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,  because \nDigney York was neither a party to the SPA nor a third- party \nbeneficiary.  \nI disagree that the Court  lacks subject matter jurisdiction  \nover Digney York\u2019 s breach of contract claim.   Whether Digney \nYork is a third- party  beneficiary under the contract is a merits  \nquestion, while subject matter jurisdiction  refers to the Court \u2019s \npower to hear the  case.  Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, this Court has \nsubject matter jurisdiction  to hear breach of contract claims of  \nparties sitting in diversity where the  amount in controversy exceeds \n$75,000.  Plaintiff s sufficiently pleaded diversity  jurisdiction, which \nWeiss does not  challenge.   \nWeiss \u2019s brief  cites a number  of cases in support of his \nargument that  the Court lacks subject matter  jurisdiction over \nDigney York\u2019s  contract  claim, but none of those cases had anything \nto do with subject matter  jurisdiction.   Weiss \u2019s request to dismiss  \nDigney York\u2019s  breach of contract claim for  lack of subject matter \njurisdiction should therefore be denied.   Of course, Weiss  remains \nfree to re- raise his merits  argument that Digney York is not a  third -\nparty beneficiary at a later stage of the case.    \nWeiss next argues that the  breach of contract claim should \nbe dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6)  because it  fails to state a claim.   \nTo state a claim  for breach of contract under Delaware law, 20F21 the \nplaintiff must plead facts plausibly  suggesting ( 1) the existence of a  \ncontract , (2) the breach of an obligation imposed by that contract , \nand ( 3) resulting damage. 21F22   \nWeiss says that the FAC  hasn\u2019t plausibly alleged elements \n(2) and (3).  I agree with Plaintiff s that the FAC  plausibly alleges \nelements (2) and (3), that  is, that Weiss breached the SPA and that  \nPlaintiff s are damaged by the breach.   As just one example, the FAC \nrefers to  section 6.4(a)  of the SPA which contains a  non-compete \nclause that,  generally  speaking, prohibits Weiss from engaging in \n \n21  The SPA has a Delaware choice of law clause.  (D.I. 8, Ex. A \u00a7 11.10.)  Neither side \ndisputes that Delaware law applies to Plaintiffs \u2019 breach of contract claim.   \n \n22 Greenstar, LLC v. Heller , 814 F. Supp. 2d 444, 450 (D. Del. 2011).  \n 6 \n the business of acting as a contractor for  the renovation of hotel \ninteriors for a  period of years.  The FAC alleges that  during that \nperiod, the website for Broad Avenue advertised itself as being in \nthe hotel renovation business and stated that  Weiss was its principal. \nThe FAC goes on to allege that Plaintiff s have and will be  damaged \nby Weiss \u2019s competition, and that  they will suffer irreparable harm,  \nincluding the \u201c ero[sion of] goodwill and relationships that Digney \nYork enjoys with its customers \u201d and \u201cmissed business  \nopportunities \u201d if Weiss is not enjoined  from operating a business in \ncompetition  with Plaintiff s. 22F23  That is enough to plausibly allege a \nbreach of the  SPA and  resulting damages.  \nWeiss contends that the  breach of contract claim should be  \ndismissed because it fails to \u201c identify a  specific product in which \nBroad Avenue is  engaged as a general contractor performing  hotel \ninterior renovations.\u201d 23F24  That argument  is a non- starter.   The FAC \nplausibly alleges that Weiss is running a company in the business of \npreconstruction and construction management of hotel  renovations, \nwhich permits a reasonable  inference that he has engaged and is  \nengaging in an activity in direct  competition with Plaintiff s and in  \nviolation of the SPA.  That is all that is  required at this stage.  \nAt oral argument, counsel for  Weiss argued that the contents \nof the  Broad Avenue website [are]  insufficient to  permit a \nreasonable inference that Weiss  or Broad Avenue  is acting as a \ngeneral  contractor or a subcontractor.  To the  extent his point is that \nthe non- compete only prohibits Weiss himself from acting  as a \ncontractor, that appears to be  contrary to the plain language of the  \ncontract , which , by its terms , prohibits  Weiss from managing and \noperating or  participating in the management or  operation of a \ncompany engaged in the  Business  (as defined by the SPA ). 24F25  The \nwebsite \u2019s screenshots attached to the [FAC]  lists Weiss as a \nprincipal of Broad Avenue  and they say that Broad Avenue was \n\u201cmade possible through Jay Weiss.\u201d 25F26  \nTo the extent D efendant \u2019s argument is that the services  \nadvertised on the website do not plausibly suggest that Broad \nAvenue engages in the  business of general contracting or  \n \n23 (FAC  \u00b6 50.)  \n \n24 (D.I. 16 at 6.)  \n \n25 (D.I. 8, Ex. A  \u00a7\u00a7 1, 6.4(a).)  \n \n26 (FAC , Ex. A.)  \n 7 \n subcontr acting, I disagree.  The listed  services include, among other \nthings, preconstruction, including design review  and budgeting,  \nconstruction management, including subcontractor management , \nand renovations. 26F27  That is enough to permit a  reasonable inference \nthat Broad Avenue  engages in general contracting or  subcontracting. \nBecause the FAC alleges  at least one plausible basis for the  breach \nof contract claim, Weiss \u2019s request  to dismiss that claim should be \ndenied.  \nThe FAC \u2019s second claim is  tortious interference with a \ncontract.   The parties dispute whether this claim  must be pleaded \nwith particularity, but I  agree with Weiss that the FAC fails to  state \na claim even under Rule 8 \u2019s liberal  pleading standards.  The \nelements of a claim for tortious inter ference with a  contract are \u201c(1) \na contract , (2) about  which defendant knew , and (3) an intentional \nact that is a significant factor in causing the breach of the  contract , \n(4) without justification , (5) which causes injury.\u201d 27F28 \nIn support of their tortious  interference claim, Plaintiff s \ncontend that Broad Avenue \u2019s website advertises  Digney York\u2019s  past \nprojects as its own.  Even taking that fact as true, however, that has \nnothing to do with whether Weiss  caused a third party to breach a \ncontract  with Plaintiff s.  I recommend that the  second claim be \ndismissed without  prejudice.  \nThe FAC \u2019s third and fourth claims are tortious interference \nwith a  prospective business relationship and unfair competition.  I \nagree with Weiss  that the FAC fails to state a claim of either of those \ncauses of action.  The elements of a claim for tortious  interference \nwith a prospective business  relationship are ( 1) the existence of a  \nvalid business relationship or expectancy,  (2) knowledge of the  \nrelationship or  expectancy on the part of the interferer , (3) \nintentional interference which induces  or causes a breach or \ntermination of the  relationship or expectancy, and (4) resulting \ndamages to the party whose  relationship or expectancy has been  \ndisrupted. 28F29  Similarly, an unfair  competition claim requires \u201c a \nreasonable expectancy of entering a valid business  relationship , with \nwhich the defendant  wrongfully interferes, and thereby defeats the \n \n27 (Id.) \n \n28 Bhole, Inc. v. Shore Invs., Inc., 67 A.3d 444, 453 (Del. 2013) . \n \n29 Enzo Life Sci., Inc. v. Digene Corp., 295 F. Supp.  2d 424, 429 (D. Del. 2003). \n 8 \n plaintiff \u2019s legitimate  expectancy and causes him harm. \u201d 29F30  To state  \na claim for either cause of action, a plaintiff must plausibly allege, \namong other things, the existence of a third party who was prepared \nto enter into a  business relationship but was dissuaded from doing \nso by the defendant. 30F31   \nPlainti ffs contend that they have a valid expectancy of future \nbusiness  relationships with their existing  customers.  Even assuming \nthat to be true, the FAC fails to allege any facts  plausibly suggesting \nthat Weiss \u2019s actions  caused a breach or termination of any such  \nexpected business relationships.  I recommend that the third  and \nfourth claims be dismissed without  prejudice.  If Plaintiff s uncover \nfacts in  discovery to support their tortious  interference and unfair \ncompetition  claims, they may seek leave to amend  their complaint. \nThe FAC \u2019s fifth claim is  styled as trade secret \nmisappropriation under the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets  Act, 6 \nDel. C. \u00a7 201, et seq. 31F32  Weiss makes several arguments  in support \nof dismissing the DUTSA claim.   First, he contends that the FAC \ndoes not  allege that any misappropriation occurred in Delaware, and \nDUTSA does not apply extraterritorially. 32F33  Plaintiffs \u2019 brief  does not \nseriously dispute that DUTSA does  not have extraterritorial effect \nand therefore does not a pply to its trade  secret misappropriation \nclaim as alleged.   Rather, Plaintiff s contend that the FAC  still states \na claim of trade secret  misappropriation under whichever state \u2019s law \napplies , so it should still move  forward even if the Court ultimately  \ndetermines that another state \u2019s law  applies.   \nPlaintiffs are certainly  correct that a claimant usually need \nnot plead choice of law in its complaint.  And the choice of law \nquestion can entail a  fact-intens ive inquiry that is often \ninappropriate on a motion to dismiss.   The situation we are in,  \nhowever, is that Plaintiff s\u2019 fifth cause  of action here expressly \npleads \u201cTrade Secret Misappropriation under Delaware  Uniform \n \n30 Agilent Techs., Inc. v. Kirkland, No. 3512, 2009 WL 119865, at *5 (Del. Ch. Jan. 20, \n2009) (citation omitted). \n \n31 See Truinject Corp. v. Galderma, S.A., No. 19- 592-LPS-JLH, 2020 WL 5095448, at *6\u2013\n7 (D. Del. Aug. 28, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, 2020 WL 6817088 (D. Del. Nov. \n20, 2020); Agilent Techs ., 2009 WL 119865, at *5 \u20138. \n \n32 (FAC  at 14.)    \n \n33 See Focus Fin. Partners, LLC v. Holsopple , 250 A.3d 939, 970 (Del. Ch. 2020) \n(\u201cDUTSA . . . lacks extraterritorial effect .\u201d). \n 9 \n Trade Secrets Act, \u201d 33F34 and there is no real dispute that the Delaware \nstatute  does not provide a cause of action for  the conduct alleged.  \nDefendant indicated  during oral argument today [his view] that the  \nstatutory trade secret claim as alleged  does not leave any room for \nthe Court to apply another state \u2019s trade secret statute down the line.  \nSo, under the  circumstances, I think the best and most  efficient \ncourse of action to avoid downstream disputes is to dismiss the  fifth \nclaim without prejudice and grant  Plaintiffs leave to amend their \nalleged trade secret misappropriation  claim , and we will  figure out \nlater which state \u2019s statute  applies to that claim. 34F35 \nDefendant also argues  that the FAC fails to state a claim of \ntrade secret misappropriation under DUTSA .  Both  Plaintiff s and \nDefendant cite Delaware law  in support of their arguments ; \nhowever,  as I just mentioned, Delaware law does not  apply to the \nconduct alleged.   Here is how I  recommend proceeding.  After \nPlaintiff s amend their pleading to fix the problem  with the reference \nto DUTSA, Weiss can, if  he so chooses, file another motion to \ndismiss and attempt to persuade the Court  that Plaintiff s failed to \nstate a plausible misappropriation claim under any state\u2019s law that \nmight apply. 35F36  \n \n34 (FAC  at 14 .) \n \n35 Cf. Cotiviti, Inc. v. Deagle , 501 F. Supp. 3d 243, 261\u201362 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (dismissing \nclaim asserted \u201c under the Connecticut Uniform Trade Secrets Act \u201d because it was \u201c alleged under \nthe wrong state \u2019s trade secret \u2019s statute \u201d); vPersonalize Inc. v. Magnetize Consultants Ltd., 437 F. \nSupp. 3d 860, 879 (W.D. Wash. 2020) (dismissing claim alleged under \u201c Washington Uniform \nTrade Secrets Act \u201d where the complaint failed to allege any facts suggesting that the Washington \nstatute applied); Vestis, LLC v. Caramel Sales, Ltd. , No. 18- 2257, 2019 WL 11542355, at *6 (C.D. \nCal. Nov. 5, 2019) (dismissing without prejudice a claim for violation of the California Uniform \nTrade Secrets Act where \u201c the Complaint in no way alleges that any of Defendants \u2019 conduct \nallegedly violating the CUTSA occur red in California, and as such, Plaintiffs cannot succeed on a \nCUTSA claim \u201d).  \n \n36 All of that said, Weiss should carefully consider whether refiling his motion to dismiss \nthe trade secret misappropriation claim is the best use of time and resources.  This case is moving forward on the breach of contract claim regardless of whether the trade secret claim moves forward, and the scope of discovery is likely going to be the same with or without the trade secret claim.  Weiss contends that neither Elkay nor Digney York can assert a claim for trade secret misappropriation based on Weiss\u2019s alleged misappropriation of Digney York\u2019s project photographs, and website.  But that\u2019s not all the FAC alleges.  The FAC alleges that the misappropriated trade secrets include confidential information like pricing models and client proprietary details, which were used to create new and innovative sales initiatives, assessments, and cost reduction projects.  The FAC alleges that both P laintiffs took steps to safeguard the \n 10 \n Weiss \u2019s final argument is  that \u201cPlaintiffs  . . . lack \nConstitutional  standing for their injunction claim\u201d  because,  \naccording to Weiss, there \u2019s no likelihood of substantial and \nimmediate  irreparable injury . 36F37  There are a host of  problems with \nthat argument.   For starters, an injunction is not a claim;  it is a \nremedy.  Moreover, as explained  earlier, the FAC adequately alleges \na breach of contract claim and the Court has  subject matter \njurisdiction over that  claim.  Whether Weiss, in fact, breached  the \ncontract, and whether one or both of  the plaintiffs are  entitled to an  \ninjunction as a remedy for that breach do not implicate this Court\u2019 s \nsubject matter  jurisdiction, and those matters are not  appropriately \nresolved on a motion to dismiss . \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, I recommend that Defendan t\u2019s motion (D.I.  15) be \nGRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED -IN-PART : \n1. Defendant\u2019s request to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim (First Cause of \nAction)  should be DENIED. \n2. Defendant\u2019s requests to dismiss Plaintiffs \u2019 claims of  tortious interference with \ncontract  (Second Cause of Action), tortious interference with prospective business relations (Third \nCause of Action), unfair competition (Fourth Cause of Action), and trade secret misappropriation \nunder the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Fifth Cause of Action) should be GRANTED .  \nThose claims should be dismissed without prejudice , and Plaintiff s should be granted leave to \namend within  fourteen days  to fix the deficiencies . \n \nconfidentiality of that information, including through section 6.4 of the SPA.  It further alleges that \nWeiss had access to the confidential information in his role as Digney York\u2019s CEO, and it alleges that Broad Avenue\u2019s website advertised Weiss as its principal and offered the same services as Digney York, and, indeed, claimed that Digney York\u2019s past projects were performed by Broad Avenue.  Those allegations would appear to be enough at this stage to put Weiss on notice of the trade secrets at issue and to survi ve a motion to dismiss.  \n \n37 (D.I. 16 at 19.)  11 \n This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.
