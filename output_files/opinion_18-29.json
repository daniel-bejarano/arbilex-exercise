{"case_name": "USA vs Hurd", "case_number": "18-29", "judge": "Judge Leonard P. Stark", "date": "12-29-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Crim. No. 18-29-LPS-1\nCHRISTOPHER HURD,\nDefendant.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 29th day of December, 2021, having reviewed Defendant\nChristopher Hurd\u2019s Motion for Reduction in Sentence Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)@)\n(D.L. 88), the government\u2019s response (D.I. 90), and Hurd\u2019s reply (D.I. 91), IT IS HEREBY\nORDERED that Hurd\u2019s Motion (D.L. 88) is DENIED.\n\nAs an initial matter, the parties dispute whether Hurd\u2019s motion is properly before the\nCourt, considering the Court\u2019s January 8, 2021 denial of Hurd\u2019s first motion to reduce his\nsentence to time served (D.I. 81). (Compare D.I. 90 (\u201cThis Court made no mention in its Order\nthat Defendant could renew his motion at a later date.\u201d) with D.L. 91 (arguing that because first\nmotion was \u201cnot denied with prejudice,\u201d Hurd can \u201cbring the matter up at a later date\u201d and\ninstant motion is \u201ca whole new motion,\u201d as it requests only 30-month reduction and presents new\nextraordinary and compelling circumstances)) The Court need not resolve this dispute and will\nproceed to the merits of the new motion.\n\nThe instant motion asserts substantially the same arguments as Hurd\u2019s first motion, and\nconsequently suffers from the same deficiency. Hurd has failed to show his early release would\n\nnot pose a danger to the community. In reaching the same conclusion with respect to Hurd\u2019s first\n\nmotion, the Court considered the nature of Hurd\u2019s underlying offense, including that Hurd\n\u201cdeliberately laced already-dangerous drugs . . . with even more dangerous substances,\u201d his\nextensive criminal history, and his record of \u201chostility towards probation officers and repeated\nviolations of court-ordered supervision.\u201d (D.I. 87 at 3) These factors remain unchanged,\nrelevant, and persuasive today. While the Court appreciates the impact Hurd\u2019s drug addiction\nmay have had on his decision-making and commends Hurd for being \u201cdrug free for 47 months\nnow\u201d (D.L. 88 at 8), it is nevertheless not persuaded that Hurd would not pose a danger to society\n\nupon release.\n\nuf\n\nHONORABLE LEONARD P. STARK\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n"}
