Colletti (argued), Roman Khasidov, Mark Basanta, HAUG \nPARTNERS LLP, New York, New York; \nAttorneys for Defendants. \nJune 24, 2022 \n1 Before me is the issue of claim construction of multiple terms in U.S. Patent Nos. \n9,359,044 (\"the '044 Patent\") and 9,586,659 (\"the '659 Patent\"). I held a claim construction \nhearing on May 3, 2022 and requested supplemental briefing on several questions. I have \nconsidered the parties' joint and supplemental briefing. (D.I. 46, 59, 60, 62). \nI. LEGAL ST AND ARD \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWHCorp ., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) ( en bane) ( cleaned up). \"' [T]here is no magic formula or catechism for \nconducting claim construction .' Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate weight to \nappropriate sources 'in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\"' SoftView LLC \nv. Apple Inc., 2013 WL 4758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (quoting Phillips, 415 F.3d at \n1324) (alteration in original). When construing patent claims, a court considers the literal \nlanguage of the claim, the patent specification , and the prosecution history. Markman v. \nWestview Instrument s, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 977-80 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 \n(1996). Of these sources, \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction \nanalysis. Usually, it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\" \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 (cleaned up). \n\"[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning .... \n[Which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in \nquestion at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application. \" \nId. at 1312-13 ( citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he ordinary meaning of a \nclaim term is its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\" Id. at 1321 \n2 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as \nunderstood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim \nconstruction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted \nmeaning of commonly understood words.\" Id. at 1314. \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evidence-the patent claims, the \nspecification, and the prosecution history-the court's construction is a determination of law. \nSee Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318,331 (2015). The court may also make \nfactual findings based upon consideration of extrinsic evidence, which \"consists of all evidence \nexternal to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, \ndictionaries, and learned treatises.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317-19 ( cleaned up). Extrinsic \nevidence may assist the court in understanding the underlying technology, the meaning of terms \nto one skilled in the art, and how the invention works. Id. Extrinsic evidence, however, is less \nreliable and less useful in claim construction than the patent and its prosecution history. Id. \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe patents claim a \"personal hydrofoil\" -a surfboard -like device that achieves a \nhovering effect by using a fin that glides under the surface of the water. This fin-the \nhydrofoil-\"enable[s] higher speeds and to lift the surfboard above the choppy, turbulent surface \nof the water, thus enabling surfing on larger waves.\" '044 Patent, 1 :26-28. \nThe '044 patent application was filed October 8, 2014. The '659 patent application was \nfiled March 8, 2016 and is a continuation of the '044 patent. The '044 and '659 patents share a \nspecification. The parties agree that the following claims are representative for their respective \npatents. The disputed claim language is italicized. \n'044 Patent, Claim 1: \n3 A passively stable, weight-shift controlled personal hydrofoil watercraft, comprising: \na flotation device that has a fore-aft length greater than a lateral width, the flotation \ndevice having a top surface and a bottom surface, wherein a user can be disposed on the \ntop surface of the flotation device in a prone, kneeling, or standing position, the flotation \ndevice having a forward section, a middle section, and a rear section, and the flotation \ndevice being controlled via weight shift of the user; \na strut having an upper end and a lower end, the upper end fixedly interconnected with \nthe flotation device between the middle section and the rear section of the flotation \ndevice; \na hydrofoil fixedly interconnected with the lower end of the strut, the hydrofoil having no \nmovable surface and designed to provide passive static stability controlled solely by \nweight shift of the user; \na propulsion system for propelling the watercraft in a body of water, wherein the \npropulsion system is connected to the hydrofoil; and \nthe watercraft having no movable steering system. \n'044 Patent, Claim 5: \nA watercraft in accordance with claim 1, wherein the design for providing the passive \nstatic stability is achieved through a combination of airfoil design, planform design and \ntailoring of span-wise twist distribution. \n'659 Patent, Claim 1: \nA passively stable, weight-shift controlled personal hydrofoil watercraft, comprising: \na flotation device that has a fore-aft length greater than a lateral width, the flotation \ndevice having a top surface and a bottom surface, wherein a user can be disposed on the \ntop surface of the flotation device in a prone, kneeling, or standing position, the flotation \ndevice having a forward section, a middle section, and a rear section; \na strut having a upper end and a lower end, the upper end fixedly interconnected with the \nflotation device between the middle section and the rear section of the flotation device; \na hydrofoil fixedly interconnected with the lower end of the strut, the hydrofoil having no \nmovable surface; \na propulsion system for propelling the watercraft in a body of water, wherein the \npropulsion system is connected to the hydrofoil; and \nthe watercraft having no movable steering system. \n4 '659 Patent, Claim 16: \nA personal hydrofoil watercraft, comprising: \na surfboard-shaped flotation device that has a fore-aft length greater than a lateral width, \nthe flotation device having a top surface and a bottom surface, wherein the top surface \nhas a substantially horizontal supporting surface configured to support a user in a prone, \nkneeling, or standing position, the flotation device having a forward section, a middle \nsection, and a rear section; \na hydrofoil interconnected with the surfboard-shaped flotation device, the hydrofoil \nhaving a strut and a first hydrofoil wing, an upper end of the strut being fixedly \ninterconnected with the surfboard-shaped flotation device; \na propulsion system attached to the surfboard -shaped flotation device for propelling the \nwatercraft in a body of water, the propulsion system comprising a battery, an electric \nmotor, a motor speed controller, and a propulsor, wherein the propulsor is selected from a \npropeller, a ducted propeller, or a pump-jet, and the battery and motor speed controller \nare contained in a watertight compartment integrated into the flotation device; \nthe watercraft having no movable steering system; \na handheld controller having a throttle; and \na throttle interface, wherein the throttle is adapted to send electronic signals to the throttle \ninterface that cause an output of the propulsion system to change. \nIII. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS \nA. Term 1: \"wherein a user can be disposed on the top surface of the flotation \ndevice in a prone, kneeling, or standing position\" ('044 Patent, Cl. 1; '659 \nPatent, Cl. 1) \nl. Plaintiff's proposed construction: \"Wherein a user can be disposed on the \ntop surface of the flotation device in each of the following positions: lying \nchest down; kneeling; or standing.\" \n2. Defendants ' proposed construction: Plain and ordinary meaning. \n3. Court's construction: \"'Prone, kneeling, or standing' are alternatives . \nOnly one of them is required.\" \n5 Plaintiff argues that the top surface of the board must allow the user to use the device in \neach listed position (prone, kneeling, and standing). Defendants disagree, arguing that the use of \nthe word \"or\" in the claim limitation means that the board must allow a user to \"be in any ( or all) \nof the three positions.\" (D.I. 62 at 4). \n\"Or\" usually designates alternatives. See Kus tom Signals, Inc. v. Applied Concepts, Inc., \n264 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2001). To deviate from the usual interpretation , a party must \nshow that the deviation is \"clearly explained in the patent documents. \" Id. Here, I do not think \nthat the patent documents show that \"or\" has anything other than its common usage. \nThe claim describes \"a flotation device ... wherein a user can be disposed on the top \nsurface of the flotation device in a prone, kneeling, or standing position .... \" '044 Patent, Cl. 1. \nPlaintiff argues, \"The conjunction 'or' is necessary because a user cannot be in all three positions \nat once .... \" (D.I. 46 at 14). I do not think that \"or\" was \"necessary\"-the patentee could have \ndrafted the claim with more clarity to claim a board that must support all three positions . The \nclaim language, as drafted, claims a top surface that supports a user in a prone position, a \nkneeling position, or a standing position. \nThe specification does not clearly explain that \"or\" ought to be given anything other than \nits usual meaning. Plaintiff cites an embodiment in support of its proposed construction. (D.I. \n46 at 12-14). The embodiment describes a \"flotation board ... similar to those used in surfing \nor sailboarding. \" '044 Patent, 3:7-8. Figure 1 shows the flotation board to be \"substantially \nflat.\" (D.I. 46 at 12). The specification further describes , \"To operate the watercraft 100, a user \ninitially lies prone on the flotation board 101. The throttle is engaged, causing the craft to \naccelerate. As the craft gains speed the user may move to a kneeling or standing position.\" '044 \nPatent, 4:33-36. \n6 Defendants argue that Plaintiff seeks to import limitations from embodiments into the \nclaims. (D.I. 46 at 18). I agree. As Defendants argue, \"claim 1 (of both patents) and claim 16 \n(of the '659 patent) are each directed to a 'personal hydrofoil watercraft,' of which a surfboard is \njust one example.\" (D.I. 46 at 19). The Figure 1 embodiment, far from clearly explaining that \nthe top surface of the claimed device must support a user in all three positions, suggests that a \n\"flat upper surface to allow an adult human to lie prone, sit, kneel or stand\" is merely \n\"preferential [. ]\" (' 044 patent, 3: 13-17). \nThus, I reject Plaintiffs proposed construction. I will give \"or\" its customary meaning of \ndesignating alternatives. The claimed top surface must support a user in at least one of the three \nlisted positions, but it need not support a user in more than one of the three. \nB. Term 2: \"wherein the top surface has a substantially horizontal supporting \nsurface configured to support a user in a prone, kneeling, or standing \nposition\" ('659 Patent, Cl. 16) \n1. Plaintiff's proposed construction : \"Wherein the top surface has a \nsubstantially horizontal supporting surface configured to support a user in \neach of the following positions: lying chest down; kneeling; or standing.\" \n2. Defendants' proposed construction: Plain and ordinary meaning. \n3. Court's construction : \"'Prone, kneeling, or standing' are alternatives . \nOnly one of them is required.\" \nFor the reasons stated in Section III.A, I reject Plaintiff's proposed construction. \nC. Term 3: \"designed to provide passive static stability\" ('044 Patent, Cl. 1) \n1. Plaintiff's proposed construction: \"Designed such that the hydrofoil has \nan initial tendency to return to its original condition when disturbed \nwithout the hydrofoil having any moveable components.\" \n7 2. Defendants ' proposed construction: Indefinite or, in the alternative, \n\"designed to provide stability without mechanisms or active control \nsystems.\" \n3. Court's construction: \"Designed such that the hydrofoil has an initial \ntendency to return to its original condition when disturbed without the \nhydrofoil having any moveable components. \" \nDefendants argue this term is indefinite. (D.I. 46 at 38). This is because, according to \nDefendants, the specification treats stability as simply a \"personal preference\" and a person of \nskill in the art (\"POSA\") would be unable to determine whether \"any particular personal \nhydrofoil watercraft falls inside or outside the scope of the claims.\" (Id. at 39.). Plaintiff \nresponds that there are criteria listed in the specification for determining stability and point to the \nexpert opinion of Mr. Barry. (Id. at 46-50). I agree with Plaintiff. The concept of stability \nappears to be well-known in the art. (See D.I. 59, 60). Plaintiff's expert, who considers himself \na POSA, has explained how the patents use the term. (D.I. 39-1, Ex. A ,r,r 71, 77-79). Thus, I \nreject Defendants ' argument that the term is indefinite. \nDefendants also dispute Plaintiff's proposed construction. The dispute is over the role of \n\"static\" in the term \"passive static stability.\" Defendants argue for the construction , \"designed to \nprovide stability without mechanisms or active control systems\" while Plaintiff has proposed the \nconstruction \"Designed such that the hydrofoil has an initial tendency to return to its original \ncondition when disturbed without the hydrofoil having any moveable components.\" I requested \nsupplemental letters providing definitions of \"stability\" from sources such as textbooks. The \nletters were helpful. Stability in the field of aerodynamics has two categories : static and \ndynamic. Static stability \"deals with the initial tendency of a vehicle to return to equilibrium ... \n8 after being disturbed. It says nothing about whether it ever reaches its equilibrium position or \nhow it gets there. Such matters are the realm of dynamic stability.\" (D.I. 60-2, Ex.Bat 602). \nDefendants' proposed construction does not account for the fact that static stability is a \nsub-category of stability. Plaintiffs proposed construction, on the other hand, captures the \nconcept of static stability. Thus, I will adopt Plaintiffs proposed construction. \nD. Term 4: \"A passively stable, weight-shift controlled personal hydrofoil \nwatercraft\" ('659 Patent, Cl. 1) \nl. Plaintiff's proposed construction: \"A watercraft having a hydrofoil, the \nhydrofoil having an initial tendency to return to its original condition \nwhen disturbed without the hydrofoil having any moveable components \nand that is controlled by weight-shift of the user.\" \n2. Defendants' proposed construction: Indefinite or, in the alternative, \"A \nweight-shift controlled personal hydrofoil watercraft that is stable without \nmechanisms or active control systems.\" \n3. Court's construction: Plain and ordinary meaning. \nUnlike the last claim term, this term does not specify \"static\" stability. As discussed \nsupra, stability incorporates both static and dynamic stability. Plaintiff asserts that a person of \nskill in the art would find \"passively stable\" and \"passive static stability\" to be interchangeable. \n(D.I. 46 at 36). I doubt that. Thus, I reject Plaintiffs proposition that the term here ought to \nhave substantially the same construction as the last term. Defendants' proposed construction, \nhowever, does not construe \"stable\" at all. For now, I will construe the term to have its plain and \nordinary meaning. The parties may readdress this issue, if it is important, in case dispositive \nmotions. \n9 E. Term 5: \"wherein the design for providing the passive static stability is \nachieved through a combination of airfoil design, planform design and \ntailoring of span-wise twist distribution\" ('044 Patent, Cl. 5) \nI. Plaintiff 's proposed construction: \"The design for providing the passive \nstatic stability is achieved through a combination of: \n\u2022 a geometry of a cross-section of the hydrofoil; \n\u2022 a shape of the hydrofoil as viewed from above; and \n\u2022 a measure of rotation of a hydrofoil section along the span of the \nhydrofoil.\" \n2. Defendants ' proposed construction: \"This claim term is not limiting or, in \nthe alternative, no construction is needed at this time.\" \n3. Court's construction: Plain and ordinary meaning. \nPlaintiffs position is that airfoil design, planform design, and tailoring of span-wise twist \ndistribution are \"structura l characteristics.\" (D.I. 46 at 53). Defendants argue that they are \nmethods of design, not structure. (Id. at 58). The parties dispute, for instance, whether \n\"tailoring\" describes an act or a structure. \n\"Tailoring\" and \"design\" could be a structure, as Plaintiff argues. At this point, however, \nI am not convinced that the term means anything other than its plain and ordinary meaning. In \nsupport of their proposed construction , Plaintiff largely cites to its expert's declaration , but I give \nthat no weight. (D.I. 46 at 53-57). Neither party has made a strong claim construction argument \nbased on the intrinsic record. The parties are free to address the construction of this term again, \nif it is important, in case dispositive motions. \n10 IV. CONCLUSION \nWithin five days the parties shall submit a proposed order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion suitable for submission to the jury. \n11 "}
