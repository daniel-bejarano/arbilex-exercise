Civil Action No. 21-01403-CFC \nJennifer Catherine Wasson and Carla Michelle Jones, POTTER ANDERSON & \nCORROON, LLP, Wilmington, Delaware; Stephen T. Raptis, REED SMITH, \nWashington, District of Columbia \nCounsel for Plaintiff \nRobert J. Katzenstein and Julie M. O'Dell, SMITH, KA TZENSTEIN, & JENKINS \nLLP, Wilmington, Delaware \nCounsel for Defendant \nApril 8, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION CHIEF JUDGE \nPlaintiff Paycom Software, Inc. (Paycom) filed this action for breach of \ncontract and a declaratory judgment against Defendants Travelers Casualty and \nSurety Company of America (Travelers) and QBE Insurance Corporation (QBE). \nD.I. 31 ~~ 46-57. Paycom alleges that Defendants have refused to pay the costs \nPaycom incurred to defend itself during an investigation by the Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC) and that the insurance policies Defendants issued to \nPaycom require coverage of Paycom's defense costs. D.I. 31 at 22-23. Pending \nbefore me is Defendants ' motion to transfer the case to the Western District of \nOklahoma. D.I. 13. Because Defendants show that, on balance, the convenience \nof the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice strongly favor transfer, I \nwill grant Defendants ' motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \n\"Pay com is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in \nOklahoma City, Oklahoma. \" D.I. 31 ~ 6. Travelers is a Connecticut corporation \nwith its principal place of business in Hartford, Connecticut , and QBE is a \nPennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in New York, New \nYork. D.I. 31 at 7-8. Both Travelers and QBE write and sell insurance policies \nand are licensed to do business in Delaware. D.I. 31 at 7-8. According to Paycom's Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint,\" D.I. 31), \nTravelers issued Paycom a directors and officers liability insurance policy for the \nApril 15, 2018 to April 15, 2019 period that covered certain \"Defense Expenses\"; \nQBE issued a \"first-layer excess\" policy that generally provides the same coverage \nas Travelers' s policy does, but only if costs exceed the limits in Travelers' s policy. \nD.I. 31 ,r,r 11, 15, 22-23. Defendants say their underwriters and Paycom's \ninsurance broker negotiated the policies in Illinois. D.I. 15 ,r 3; D.I. 16 ,r 3. \nThe Complaint further alleges that the SEC issued an order on September \n18, 2018 and subpoenas in 2019 and 2020 that required Pay com and certain of its \nofficers and other \"Insured Persons\"1 to provide 175,000 documents and repeated \ntestimony to the SEC and its investigators. \"Paycom indemnified the Defense \nCosts incurred by the [those individuals] in connection with the SEC['s] \n[i]nvestigation.\" D.I. 31 ,r,r 25, 28-31. The SEC and Paycom reached a settlement \non June 10, 2021, and the SEC found on July 30, 2021 that Paycom violated \nSection 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(b)(2). \nD.I. 31 ,r,r 31-34. Paycom did not admit to the SEC's findings. D.I. 31 ,r 33. \nThereafter, Paycom sought coverage under Travelers's and QBE's insurance \npolicies for the costs of defending itself and its officers and Insured Persons. D.I. \n1 \"The Travelers Primary Policy defines 'Insured Person' to include, inter alia, \nPaycom's directors, officers, certain employees, and/or persons serving in 'any \nfunctional equivalent position.\"' D.I. 31 ,r 16. \n2 31 ,r,r 35-36. Travelers and QBE do not dispute that their policies covered the \ncosts Paycom incurred defending individuals, but they have denied coverage for \nthe costs Paycom incurred for its own defense. D.I. 31 ,r,r 4, 38-39. Paycom \nbrought this action on September 8, 2021 in Delaware Superior Court and sought \nboth a declaratory judgment that Defendants had to cover Pay com' s defense costs \nand damages for Defendants' breach of their insurance contracts. D .I. 1-1 at 1, 21-\n22. Defendants removed the case to this Court \"[p]ursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n1332(a), 1441, and 1446.\" D.I. 1 at 1. Defendants allege, and Paycom does not \ncontest, that I have diversity jurisdiction over this case, since there is complete \ndiversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. D.I. 1 ,r 5; \nD.I. 19 at 18; D.I. 31 at 22. \nDefendants now ask me to transfer the case to the W estem District of \nOklahoma pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). D.I. 13. Defendants argue that \"[t]he \nWestern District of Oklahoma is the most appropriate and convenient venue \nbecause it is where Paycom is headquartered, where the [insurance] Policies were \nissued, where key potential witnesses and documents are located, where many of \nthe acts underlying Paycom's claim for coverage occurred, and where Paycom \nsuffered any alleged harm under the Policies.\" D.I. 14 ,r 4. Paycom opposes \ntransfer on the grounds that Paycom is incorporated in Delaware; \"[t]his action \ninvolves directors and officers liability ('D&O') insurance risks that are uniquely \n3 related to Delaware; [ t ]his dispute likely will be decided under Delaware law; and \nDelaware courts are highly experienced in adjudicating D&O coverage disputes \n.... \" D.I. 19 at 1. \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. Legal Standards \nSection 1404(a) provides that \"[f]or the convenience of the parties and \nwitnesses, in the interests of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to \nany other district or division where it might have been brought.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1404( a). Pay com does not dispute that this action could have been brought in the \nWestern District of Oklahoma. D .I. 19. Thus, the only issue before me is whether \nI should exercise my discretion under\u00a7 1404(a) to transfer the case to that district. \nDefendants have the burden \"to establish that a balancing of proper interests \nweigh[s] in favor of the transfer.\" Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 25 \n(3d Cir. 1970). This burden is heavy. \"[U]nless the balance of convenience of the \nparties is strongly in favor of [the] defendant[s], the plaintiff's choice of forum \nshould prevail.\" Id. ( emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \nAlthough there is \"no definitive formula or list of the factors to consider\" in \na transfer analysis, the Third Circuit identified in Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 \nF.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995), 12 interests \"protected by the language of\u00a7 \n4 1404(a).\" Id. Six of those interests are private: \n[ 1] plaintiffs forum preference as manifested in the \noriginal choice; [2] the defendant's preference; [3] \nwhether the claim arose elsewhere; [4] the convenience \nof the parties as indicated by their relative physical and \nfinancial condition; [5] the convenience of the \nwitnesses-but only to the extent that the witnesses may \nactually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and [ 6] \nthe location of books and records ( similarly limited to the \nextent that the files could not be produced in the \nalternative forum). \nId. (citations omitted). The other six interests are public in nature: \n[7] the enforceability of the judgment; [8] practical \nconsiderations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, \nor inexpensive; [9] the relative administrative difficulty \nin the two fora resulting from court congestion; [10] the \nlocal interest in deciding local controversies at home; \n[11] the public policies of the fora; and [12] the \nfamiliarity of the trial judge with the applicable state law \nin diversity cases. \nId. at 879-80 ( citations omitted). As the parties have not identified relevant factors \nbeyond these 12 interests, I will balance the Jumara factors in deciding whether to \nexercise the discretion afforded me by \u00a7 1404( a) to transfer the case to the Western \nDistrict. D.I. 14 at 7; D.I. 19 at 3. \nB. Analysis of the Jumara Factors \nI examine each Jumara factor in tum. \n5 1. Plaintiff's Forum Preference \nThe parties agree that this factor weighs against transfer. D.I. 14 at 11-12; \nD.I. 19 at 4-7. But they disagree about this factor's weight in the Jumara \nbalancing test. Paycom contends that I should give its forum choice \"paramount \nconsideration.\" D .I. 19 at 7. Defendants argue that Paycom' s forum choice should \nreceive less weight because \"Paycom's 'home turf is Oklahoma, not Delaware and \nthe only connection this action has to Delaware is that Paycom is incorporated \nthere.\" D.I. 14 at 11. \nIn Shutte, the Third Circuit held that \"[i]t is black letter law that a plaintiff's \nchoice of a proper forum is a paramount consideration in any determination of a \ntransfer request\" brought pursuant to \u00a7 1404( a), and that this choice \"should not be \nlightly disturbed.\" 431 F .2d at 25 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nThe parties have not cited, and I am not aware of, any Third Circuit or United \nStates Supreme Court case that overruled Shutte. Jumara cited Shutte favorably \nand reiterated the admonition that \"the plaintiff's choice of venue should not be \nlightly disturbed.\" Jumara, 55 F .3d at 879 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). And the Third Circuit has since cited Shutte favorably twice. See In re: \nHowmedica Osteonics Corp, 867 F.3d 390, 401-02 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing Shutte, \n431 F.3d at 25); In re U.S., 213 F.3d 380,388 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting Shutte, 431 \n6 F .3d at 25). Thus, binding Third Circuit law compels me to treat Paycom' s forum \nchoice as \"a paramount consideration\" in the\u00a7 1404(a) balancing analysis. \nDefendants argue that I should discount Pay com' s forum choice because it \nlacks a physical connection to Delaware. But I will instead follow Judge \nStapleton's lead in Burroughs Wei/come Co. v. Giant Food, Inc., 392 F. Supp. 761 \n(D. Del. 1975). Like Judge Stapleton, I read Shutte 's \"statement of 'black letter \nlaw' as an across-the-board rule favoring plaintiffs choice of forum.\" Id. at 763. \nAs Judge Stapleton explained in rejecting the \"home-turf' rule argued by the \ndefendant in Burroughs: \nThe court's decision in Shutte to give weight to the \nplaintiffs choice of forum is not an application of any of \nthe criteria recited in[\u00a7 1404(a)]. Assuming jurisdiction \nand proper venue, weight is given to plaintiffs choice \nbecause it is plaintiffs choice and a strong showing under \nthe statutory criteria in favor of another forum is then \nrequired as a prerequisite to transfer. One can perhaps \ndebate whether plaintiffs choice should be given any \nweight at all in a transfer context, but assuming it is to be \ngiven some weight in cases where the plaintiff lives in the \nforum state, it is difficult to see why it should not also be \ngiven weight when the plaintiff lives in [another] state .... \n[The] plaintiffs contact or lack thereof with the forum \ndistrict will ordinarily be reflected in the 'balance' of \nconveniences, but that contact, per se, is unrelated to \nanything in Shutte, or Section 1404(a). \nId. at 763 n.4. \nI, too, find it difficult to understand why the plaintiffs forum choice in and \nof itself merits less weight when the plaintiff has no ties to the selected forum or \n7 even when the facts underlying the controversy occurred elsewhere. I do not mean \nto suggest that these two latter considerations will not impact the overall transfer \nanalysis. On the contrary, because these considerations are subsumed and given \nweight under Jumara factors 3 (whether the claim arose elsewhere), 4 \n( convenience of the parties), 5 ( convenience of the witnesses), 6 (location of books \nand records), 8 (practical considerations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, \nor inexpensive), and 10 (the local interest in deciding local controversies at home), \na defendant seeking to transfer a case when neither the plaintiff nor the facts giving \nrise to the case have any connection to the selected forum will generally have less \ndifficulty in meeting its burden to establish that the Jumara factors weigh strongly \nin favor of transfer. \n2. Defendant's Forum Preference \nThis factor favors transfer. \n3. Whether the Claim Arose Elsewhere \nDefendants argue that the harm to Paycom occurred in Oklahoma because \nDefendants issued insurance policies \"to Paycom at its headquarters in Oklahoma \nCity .... \" D.I. 14 at 13; D.I. 1-2 at 38, 80, 91. Paycom responds that the \nDefendants negotiated, underwrote, and \"denied coverage from locations in New \nYork and Illinois\" and that \"most (if not all) of the liability-generating events \n8 resulting in Paycom' s insurance claims at issue in this action ... occurred outside \nof Oklahoma.\" D.I. 19 at 9 (emphasis in original). \nSince it is undisputed that ( 1) nothing occurred in Delaware giving rise to \nthe claims, (2) the SEC issued subpoenas to Paycom in Oklahoma, and (3) the \ninsurance policies at issue were issued to Paycom in Oklahoma, this factor favors \ntransfer. \n4. The Convenience of the Parties as Indicated by Their \nRelative Physical and Financial Condition \nDefendants argue that \"litigation in Oklahoma should be more convenient \nthan litigation in Delaware because Paycom is headquartered in Oklahoma City\" \nand no party is located in Delaware. D.I. 14 at 14. Paycom responds that, while it \nchose Delaware and, thus, finds Delaware convenient, Defendants \"cannot credibly \nallege that Oklahoma would be a more convenient forum for them than Delaware.\" \nD.I. 19 at 11. Defendants respond that it would \"be more convenient to the parties \noverall to litigate where Paycom and its principals are located.\" D.I. 23 at 6. \nAll three parties are national corporations. Paycom has asserted that it finds \nDelaware a more convenient forum for it, and I defer to Pay com' s choice. I agree \nwith Defendants that the location of at least some potential witnesses in Oklahoma \nmakes that forum marginally more convenient. But I agree with Paycom that \nDefendants-residents of Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania with \noperations in Illinois and authorization to write insurance policies in Delaware-\n9 have no reasonable additional claims that Oklahoma is more convenient. Overall, I \nfind this factor is neutral. \n5. The Convenience of Witnesses \nUnder Third Circuit law, the district court is to consider the convenience of \nwitnesses \"only to the extent that the witnesses may actually be unavailable for \ntrial in one of the fora.\" Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879; see also Smart Audio Techs., LLC \nv. Apple, Inc., 910 F. Supp. 2d 718, 732 (D. Del. 2012) (noting that this factor \napplies only insofar as \"a witness actually will refuse to testify absent a \nsubpoena\"). At least six of the nine Pay com officers and employees who were \nsubpoenaed by the SEC reside in Oklahoma. Two of those Oklahoma residents no \nlonger work for Pay com. D .I. 16 1 5. All the Oklahoma residents are outside the \nsubpoena power of this Court, and Pay com is unable to guarantee that these \nindividuals would consent to traveling to Delaware to appear at any trial. Neither \nparty has identified any potential witness who resides in Delaware. Accordingly, \nthis factor weighs in favor of transfer to Oklahoma. \n6. The Location of Books and Records \nJumara instructs me to give weight to the location of books and records only \n\"to the extent that the files [ and other documentary evidence] could not be \nproduced in the alternative forum.\" 55 F.3d at 879. Defendants argue that many \nof the files that concern the insurance policies, the SEC' s investigation, and \n10 correspondence between the parties are located at Pay com' s Oklahoma \nheadquarters, and none of the documents are in Delaware. D.I. 14 at 16. But it is \nundisputed that these documents are mostly, if not entirely, already in Travelers' s \npossession or that Defendants maintain these documents. See D.I. 19 at 14-15; \nD.I. 23 at 8. Accordingly, this factor is neutral. See Signal Tech, LLC v. Analog \nDevices, Inc., 2012 WL 1134723, at *3 (D. Del. Apr. 3, 2012) (\"[T]here are no \nrecords identified as only being available in one of the two locations. Thus, under \nThird Circuit law, ... the location of the books and records is a neutral factor.\" \n(internal footnote omitted)). \n7. The Enforceability of the Judgment \nThe parties agree this factor is neutral. D.I. 14 at 16; D.I. 19 at 16. \n8. Practical Considerations \nJumara instructs me to give weight to \"practical considerations that could \nmake the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive.\" 55 F.3d at 879. Although I did \nnot consider economic cost and logistical inconvenience of potential party \nemployee witnesses when I assessed factors 4 and 5, it is appropriate to consider \nthese issues in assessing \"practical considerations.\" See Joao Control & \nMonitoring Sys., LLC v. Ford Motor Co., 2013 WL 4496644, at *7 (D. Del. Aug. \n21, 2013); Mite/ Networks Corp. v. Facebook, Inc., 943 F. Supp. 2d 463, 475-76 \n11 (D. Del. 2013). Counsel's travel is also an appropriate consideration. Signal Tech, \n2012 WL 1134723, at *3. \nHere, the considerations are mixed. Holding a trial near Pay com' s \nOklahoma City headquarters will make it easier and cheaper for Defendants to \nobtain the appearance of current or former Paycom employees at a trial. D.I. 14 at \n16. Delaware, on the other hand, is more convenient for the parties' counsel, who \nwork in Delaware, New York, and Washington, D.C. D.I. 19 at 16. I weigh the \nburden for potential witnesses somewhat more heavily than that for counsel. Thus, \nI find this factor weighs in favor of transfer. \n9. Relative Administrative Difficulty Due to Court Congestion \nDefendants argue this factor weighs heavily in favor of transfer and cite to \nstatistics on the comparative volume of cases and time to trial. D.I. 14 at 17-18. \nPaycom responds that this factor weighs against transfer, since \"this case is \nsubstantially unlikely to proceed to trial[,]\" and Delaware's comparatively faster \ntime to resolve all civil actions \"render[s] both time to reach trial and cases per \njudgeship effectively irrelevant.\" D .I. 19 at 17. \nPaycom is correct that the time from filing to disposition is lower in \nDelaware (7 .1 months) than in the W estem District of Oklahoma ( 10 months). \nU.S. District Courts-Combined Civil and Criminal Federal Court Management \nStatistics, Admin. Off. of U.S. Cts. (Dec. 31, 2021), \n12 https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/na/federal-court-management\u00ad\nstatistics/2021/12/31-3. But given the relative caseloads of the districts, this factor \nfavors transfer. According to the most recent data available, Delaware had 1,993 \nfilings, or 498 per judgeship, in calendar year 2021, versus 1,837 filings, or 306 per \njudgeship, in the Western District of Oklahoma. Id. The data also shows 953 \nweighted filings per judgeship in Delaware and 291 in the Western District of \nOklahoma. Id. \"Weighted filings statistics account for the different amounts of \ntime district judges require to resolve various types of civil and criminal actions.\" \nExplanation of Selected Terms, Admin. Off. of U.S. Cts. (Mar. 2012), \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/explanation-selected-terms-district\u00ad\nmarch-2012_0.pdf. Cases that require substantially more judicial resources than \nthe average civil case receive a higher weight. Id \nFinally, the current data do not account for the vacancy that the elevation of \nmy former colleague, the Hon. Judge Leonard P. Stark, to the Federal Circuit \ncreated earlier this year. Current Judicial Vacancies, Admin. Off. of U.S. Cts. \n(Mar. 29, 2022), https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial\u00ad\nvacancies/current-judicial-vacancies. The vacancy has required this Court to \nreassign certain cases to a vacancy docket and take other measures to manage the \nCourt's substantial caseload. See In re: Vacant Judgeship, Standing Or. No. 2022-\nV AC-I (Mar. 9, 2022), https://www.ded.uscourts.gov/sites/ded/files/general-\n13 orders/Standing%20Order%,20re%20V AC.pdf. Thus, Delaware faces a growing \nnumber of weighted filings per judgeship. \nTherefore, I find this factor weighs strongly in favor of transfer. \n10. Local Interest in Deciding Local Controversies at Home \nIt is undisputed that the insurance policies in question were issued in \nOklahoma. D.I. 19 at 9 n.3. Oklahoma has an interest in deciding a dispute that \nconcerns insurance policies issued within its boundaries by a company \nheadquartered in Oklahoma. See SAB One, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co. of \nConnecticut, 2014 WL 6901741, at *4 (W.D. Okla. Dec. 5, 2014) (holding that \n\" [ t ]he regulatory authority of the Insurance Commissioner under the Oklahoma \nInsurance Code expressly encompasses the conduct of insurers in the marketing \nand sale of insurance policies, disclosures of information, and the adjustment of \nclaims\" and that \"the Commissioner has jurisdiction over complaints against all \npersons engaged in the business of insurance.\" ( citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). Paycom argues that \"to the extent Oklahoma and Delaware's \nlocal interests are pertinent here (given the parties' diverse citizenship), this factor \nstrongly favors Delaware, which has expressed a strong local and public policy \ninterest in having coverage disputes arising under D&O policies issued to \nDelaware corporations adjudicated in Delaware courts.\" D.I. 19 at 18. Paycom \ncites and I know of no authority that supports this proposition where the coverage \n14 dispute is not between Delaware corporations. In any event, I agree with Judge \nNoreika that \"[a]lthough Delaware clearly has a public policy interest in the \ncapabilities and conduct of officers and directors of Delaware corporations, this \npublic policy is not directly related to insurance coverage disputes.\" Ceradyne, \nInc. v. RLI Ins. Co., 2021 WL 3145171, at *9 (D. Del. July 26, 2021). \nAccordingly, this factor favors transfer. \n11. Public Policies of the Fora \nThis factor largely overlaps the local interest factor and the parties' \narguments with respect to this factor essentially repeat what they argued with \nrespect to the local interest factor. I will therefore treat the factor as neutral. \n12. Familiarity of the Trial Judges with the Applicable State \nLaw in Diversity Cases \nThis is a diversity case, so Jumara factor 12 is relevant. Defendants admit \nthat Delaware's choice-of-law rules apply, but they argue that the controversy \nrequires application of the \"plain terms\" ofTravelers's and QBE's insurance \npolicies and that \"the Western District of Oklahoma is more than capable of \ncarrying out the required coverage analysis.\" D.I. 14 at 20. Paycom responds that \nthis Court decides disputes related to directors and officers insurance policies more \nfrequently than does the Western District of Oklahoma and that Delaware law \nlikely applies because Delaware courts apply Delaware law to the interpretation of \ndirectors and officers insurance policies issued to Delaware corporations. D.I. 19 \n15 at 5, 21-22. For this second point, Paycom cites RSUI Indemnification Co. v. \nMurdock, 248 A.3d 887, 896-901 (Del. 2021), in which the Delaware Supreme \nCourt held that Delaware law applied to a directors and officers insurance policy \ndispute after it applied Delaware's choice-of-law test. Defendants respond that \n\"[a]n insurance policy is a contract, and [all] Article III judges ... are more than \ncapable of' contract interpretation. D.I. 23 at 11. \nI agree with Defendants. Article III judges, wherever located, are competent \nto interpret director and officer insurance policies. Moreover, at this early stage in \nthe controversy, I am unable to determine to what jurisdiction Delaware's choice\u00ad\nof-law test would point. The parties have not briefed how Delaware's most \nsignificant relationship test would apply, and, as the multi-layered and fact-specific \nanalysis in Murdock shows, the analysis is neither clear cut nor straight-forward. \nMurdock, 248 A.3d at 896-97 {\"The contacts to be taken into account at this step \nare: the place of contracting; the place of negotiation of the contract; the place of \nperformance; the location of the subject matter of the contract; and the domicile, \nresidence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.\"). \nAccordingly, I find that this factor is neutral. \n* * * * \nIn sum, of the 12 Jumara factors, six weigh in favor of transfer ( one of them \nstrongly in favor), one weighs against transfer ( and is to be given paramount \n16 importance), and five are neutral. I find that, considered in their totality, the \nJumara factors weigh strongly in favor of transfer, and therefore I will grant the \nDefendants' motion to transfer venue. \nThe Court will enter an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n17 "}
