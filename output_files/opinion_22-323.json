SMITH, JR.,  : \n: \nPlaintiff,  : : \nv. : Civil Action No. 22- 323-RGA  \n: \nSPRINGHILL SUITES , : : \nDefendant.  : \nF\nrederick W. Smith, Jr., Sussex Correctional Institution, Georgetown , Delaware .  \nPro Se Plaintiff.  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nMa\ny 6, 2022 \nWilmington, DelawareCase 1:22-cv-00323-RGA   Document 8   Filed 05/06/22   Page 1 of 4 PageID #: 561 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Frederick W. Smith, Jr., an inmate at Sussex Correctional Institution in \nGeorgetown, Delaware , filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.   (D.I. 3).  Plaintiff  \nappears pro se and proceeds in forma pauperis .  The Court proceeds to screen the \nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).     \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   On February 14, 2021, Plaintiff sustained injur ies when he \nslipped and fell down a hill on property located at Defendant Springhill Suites Hotel in \nNewark, Delaware.  (D.I. 3 at 5- 6)  Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.  \n(Id. at 8).   \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013).  S ee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915( e)(2) (in forma pauperis  actions) .  The C ourt must \naccept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d \nCir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro \nse, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, Case 1:22-cv-00323-RGA   Document 8   Filed 05/06/22   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 572 \n must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U .S. at 94 .  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pur suant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to st ate a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915 , the C ourt must grant \nPlaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.   \nSee Grayson v. Mayvie w State Hosp. , 293 F.3d 103, 114  (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007) .  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asse rted.  See id. at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not enti tled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then Case 1:22-cv-00323-RGA   Document 8   Filed 05/06/22   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 583 \n determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 201 6).  Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \n The Complaint will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. I have reviewed the \nComplaint and it does not raise a federal civil claim for violations of the United States \nConstitution or federal statutes. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.   Although Plaintiff invokes 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Defendant is not a state actor, a necessary element for claims under \u00a7 1983.  See West v. Atkins , 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) .   \nIn addition, both parties are in domiciled in Delaware and, therefore, there is no \ndiversity of citizenship as required for diversity jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.  \nThe Court does not have jurisdiction over this matter.  Therefore, the case will be \ndismissed.  \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  the dismiss the Complaint for want of \njurisdiction. The Court finds amendment futile . \nAn ap propriate O rder will be entered.  Case 1:22-cv-00323-RGA   Document 8   Filed 05/06/22   Page 4 of 4 PageID #: 59"}
