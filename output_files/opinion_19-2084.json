F bs\nCONNOLLY, CHIEF \u00e9UDGE:\n\nPending before the Court are Petitioner Arlando Ingram\u2019s Petitions for a Writ of\nHabeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2254. (D.I. 2; D.I. 3; D.I. 9; D.I. 10) The State\nfiled an Answer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 21; D.I. 26) For the\nreasons discussed, the Court will deny the relief requested and dismiss the Petitions.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n[Petitioner] was initially indicted in a 48 count indictment in\nDecember 2012 for his alleged participation in a veritable\nRobbery crime wave, involving multiple armed robberies of\nsmall businesses in the Dover, Delaware area. The robberies\noccurred in August and September 2012. Following the final\nrobbery which occurred on September 4, 2012, [Petitioner\u2019s]\nco-defendants were apprehended while fleeing the scene.\nAlthough the police saw three suspects fleeing the scene\n[Petitioner] was able to avoid capture at the time. Following\nthe arrest of [Petitioner's] co-defendants, the day of the\nRobbery, one of the suspects told the police that [Petitioner]\nwas the third suspect who had gotten away from the police.\nAdditionally the police recovered an unopened pack of\nNewport cigarettes, which the victims had told the police had\nbeen taken by the robbers, along the path that the third\nsuspect had fled. After a forensic exam [Petitioner's]\nfingerprints were identified on the Newport cigarette pack.\nBased on these facts the police developed [Petitioner] as the\nfinal suspect in the Robbery spree. Armed with a search\nwarrant the Dover Police arrested [Petitioner] on September\n27, 2012 after [Petitioner] resisted arrest and was found with\na loaded firearm similar to the one the victims identified as\nbeing used in the robbery.\n\nState v. Ingram, 2018 WL 3459209, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. June 28, 2018).\n\nIncluded in the original December 2012 forty-eight count indictment were five\ncounts of possession of a firearm by a person prohibited (\u201cPFBPP\u201d) and two counts of\npossession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited (\u201cPDWBPP\u2019\u201d). (D.I. 22-1); see\n\nIngram, 2018 WL 3459209, at *1 (stating there were seven counts of PFBPP in the\noriginal indictment). Petitioner's trial for all the charges associated with the September\n4, 2012 robbery and his September 27, 2012 arrest was scheduled to begin on\nNovember 18, 2013. (D.I. 22-2 at Entry No. 4)\n\nOn May 23, 2013, Petitioner filed a motion to sever the five PFBPP charges from\nthe robbery charges. (D.I. 22-1 at Entry No. 28) The Superior Court granted the motion\non May 31, 2013. (D.I. 22-1 at Entry No. 29) On May 5, 2014, the day Petitioner's trial\nfor the PFBPP charges was to begin, Petitioner made an oral motion to sever two\ncounts of PFBPP from the other remaining charges. (D.!. 22-3 at Entry No. 2) The\nSuperior Court granted the motion that same day. (D.I. 22-3 at Entry No. 3) Petitioner\nimmediately proceeded to trial \u201con the two counts of PFBPP. One count, which was\ncharged in connection with [Petitioner's] September 27 arrest, was tried before a jury.\nThe other count, which was charged in connection with September 4 robbery, was tried\nbefore the trial judge but then nolle prossed.\u201d Ingram v. State, 108 A.3d 1225 (Table),\n2015 WL 631581, at *1 (Del. Feb. 11, 2015). The case on the PFBPP charge that went\nto a jury trial is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cD Case.\u201d\n\nAfter the PFBPP charges were severed in May 2013, the trial on the remaining\noriginal charges was still scheduled to begin on November 18, 2013. (D.1. 22-2 at Entry\nNo. 4) On November 12, 2013, Petitioner filed a motion to suppress evidence seized\nfrom his sister's residence on the day of his arrest. (/d. at Entry No. 2) On November\n18, 2013, the first day of trial, the State made an oral motion to sever from the\nremaining charges Petitioner\u2019s (1) resisting arrest charge related to his September 27,\n2012 arrest and (2) the charges related to the September 4, 2012 robbery \u2014 two counts\n\nof first degree robbery, one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a\nfelony, one count of second degree conspiracy. With the agreement of Petitioner and\nhis counsel, the Superior Court granted the severance request. (D.I. 22-17 at 64-66)\nImmediately thereafter, the Superior Court heard testimony on Petitioner's motion to\nsuppress the evidence obtained from his arrest on September 27, 2012, denied the\nmotion from the bench, and commenced the trial. (/d. at Entry No. 5); see State v.\nIngram, 2018 WL 3459209, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. June 28, 2018). This case on the\nsevered robbery and resisting arrest charges is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cC Case.\u201d\n\nThe same defense counsel represented Petitioner in the severed C and D\nCases, and separate Superior Court juries convicted Petitioner of the charges\nassociated with those cases.\u2019 The specific factual and procedural histories of the C and\nD cases are set forth separately below.\n\nA. The C Case: September 4, 2012 Robbery and September 27, 2012\nResisting Arrest\n\nOn September 4, 2012, three black males\u2014two adults and\none teenager\u2014robbed the Baycourt Plaza Family Dollar store\nin Dover, Delaware. One adult wore a black ski mask. The\nother adult wore a tee-shirt tied around the lower half of his\nface and had a gun. The teenager did not wear a mask.\n\nTwo female employees, a store cashier and a manager, were\nin the store at the time of the robbery. The gunman ordered\nthe cashier to open the cash registers. When she could not,\nthe man in the black ski mask ordered her to the floor, and the\ngunman ordered the manager to open the cash registers.\nMeanwhile, the teenage boy removed packs of Newport\ncigarettes and Swisher cigars from a cabinet behind the front\ncounter. When leaving the store, the three suspects fled down\na nearby bike path, taking with them the cash from the cash\n\n\u2018Following the sentencing [in the C and D cases,] the State entered nolle prosequis on\nthe remaining Robbery related counts, without prejudice due to [Petitioner] having\nreceived a total of 100 years in jail following the two trials.\u201d State v. Ingram, 2018 WL\n3459209, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. June 28. 2018).\n\n3\nregisters, nearly three dozen packs of Newports, and several\ncigars. The store manager immediately called 911.\n\nWithin minutes of the 911 dispatch, Dover police\napprehended two suspects in the area of the bike path. The\npolice also recovered from the bike path a black ski mask, a\npack of unopened Newports, two one-dollar bills, and a tee-\nshirt. When the items were processed for fingerprints, a\nthumbprint located on the cigarette pack was matched to\n[Petitioner].\n\nThe police obtained an arrest warrant for [Petitioner] and\n\narrested him on September 27, 2012, after tracking him to his\n\nsister's apartment in Dover. Before executing the arrest\n\nwarrant, the police made contact with [Petitioner's] sister,\n\nLutricia Ingram, who confirmed that [Petitioner] was inside her\n\napartment. [Petitioner] put up a fight when the police entered\n\nthe apartment to arrest him. When struggling with the police,\n\n[Petitioner] made repeated attempts to reach for a gun under\n\nthe couch. After [Petitioner] was subdued and taken into\n\ncustody, Lutricia Ingram gave the police written consent to\n\nsearch the apartment.\nIngram v. State, 106 A.3d 1049 (Table), 2014 WL 7465977, at *1 (Del. Dec. 30, 2014).\n\nOn November 25, 2013, a Superior Court jury found Petitioner guilty of all\n\ncharges in the C Case \u2014 two counts of first degree robbery, and one count each of\nPFDCF, second degree conspiracy, and resisting arrest. (D.I. 22-2 at Entry No. 11);\nIngram, 2014 WL 7465977, at *2. The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner as a\nhabitual offender on January 30, 2014 to \u201ca total of seventy-eight years at Level V\nsuspended after seventy-five years for one year at Level Il probation and one year at\nLevel | probation.\u201d Ingram, 2014 WL 7465977, at *2. On direct appeal, Petitioner's\ndefense counsel filed a no-merits brief pursuant to Delaware Supreme Court Rule 26(c),\nbut submitted several arguments on Petitioner's behalf. The Delaware Supreme Court\n\naffirmed Petitioner's convictions on December 30, 2014. /d. at *3.\nOn May 5, 2015, Petitioner field a pro se motion for postconviction relief pursuant\nto Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d) and a motion to appoint\ncounsel. (D.I. 22-2 at Entry Nos. 31, 32) The Superior Court appointed counsel to\nrepresent Petitioner in his Rule 61 proceeding. Appointed counsel filed an amended\nRule 61 motion asserting the following three ineffective assistance of trial counsel\nclaims: (1) trial counsel erred by not moving to sever the resisting arrest charge from the\nC Case; (2) trial counsel erred by not objecting to Detective Bumgarner\u2019s testimony\nduring trial; and (3) trial counsel erred by not opposing a jury instruction on flight. (D.I.\n22-20 at 53-90) In June 2018, a Superior Court Commissioner recommended that the\namended Rule 61 motion be denied. See /ngram, 2018 WL 3459209, at *6. Petitioner\nfiled objections to the Commissioner's Report and Recommendation (D.I. 22-2 at Entry\nNo. 56). In September 2019, the Superior Court rejected Petitioner's objections,\nadopted the Report and Recommendation, and denied Petitioner's amended Rule 61\nmotion. (D.I. 22-2, at Entry No. 60) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision\nin June 2019. See Ingram v. State, 2019 WL 25377385, at *1 (Del. June 19, 2019).\n\nB. The D Case: September 27, 2012 PFBPP Charge\n\nPetitioner's trial on his September 27, 2012 PFBPP charge began on May 5,\n2014, and a Superior Court jury found him guilty of the offense on May 6, 2014. (D.I.\n22-3 at Entry Nos. 4, 6) On August 13, 2014, the Superior Court sentenced Petitioner\nas a habitual offender to \u201ctwenty-five years mandatory at Level V incarceration followed\nby one year at Level Ill probation.\u201d Ingram, 2015 WL 631581, at *1. On direct appeal,\n\nPetitioner's defense counsel filed a no-merits brief pursuant to Delaware Supreme Court\nRule 26(c) (\u201cRule 26(c)\u201d), but presented three arguments on Petitioner's behalf. The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's conviction. See id. at *3.\n\nOn June 3, 2015, Petitioner filed a pro se Rule 61 motion and a motion to appoint\ncounsel. (D.|. 22-2 at Entry Nos. 19, 20) The Superior Court granted the motion for the\nappointment of counsel. On April 17, 2017, appointed counsel filed an amended Rule\n61 motion asserting that defense counsel was ineffective for: (1) failing to present a\nDNA report that could not conclusively link Petitioner to the recovered firearm; and (2)\nfailing to present testimony that Petitioner's fingerprints were not found on the recovered\nfirearm. (D.I. 22-2 at Entry Nos. 21, 32; D.I. 22-27, at 74-94) In June 2018, a Superior\nCourt Commissioner recommended that the amended Rule 61 motion be denied. See\nState v. Ingram, 2018 WL 3126096, at *10 (Del. Super. Ct. Jun. 21, 2018). Petitioner\nfiled objections to the Recommendation and Report. (D.I. 22-2 Entry No. 41; D.I. 22-28\nat 136-140) The Superior Court rejected Petitioner's objections, adopted the Report\nand Recommendation, and denied the amended Rule 61 motion on September 25,\n2018. (D.I. 22-2 at Entry No. 45) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision\non June 19, 2019. See Ingram v. State, 2019 WL 2537627, at*1 (Del. June 19, 2019).\n\nC. Habeas Petitions\n\nPetitioner timely filed his original Petition and Memorandum of Law in November\n2019 challenging his conviction for PFBPP in the D Case, asserting three Claims: (1)\nthe trial court violated his Fourth Amendment rights by failing to suppress the evidence\nillegally seized during his September 27, 2012 arrest; (2) his due process rights were\nviolated during trial because the State did not meet its burden of proof; and (3) defense\n\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to present a DNA report that did not\nconclusively link Petitioner to the gun, and by failing to present testimony that\nPetitioner's fingerprints were not on the gun. (D.I. 2; D.I. 2-2)\n\nPetitioner filed a second Petition and Memorandum of Law in December 2019\nchallenging his conviction for the charges related to the September 4, 2012 robbery and\nhis September 27, 2012 arrest in the C Case, asserting three Claims: (1) the trial court\nviolated his Fourth Amendment rights by failing to suppress the evidence illegally seized\nduring his September 27, 2012 arrest; (2) his due process rights were violated by the\nState's failure to authenticate the gun in accordance with Delaware Rule of Evidence\n901, and by the State\u2019s failure to demonstrate the gun was \u201crelevant\u201d under Delaware\nRules of Evidence 401, 402, 404; and (3) defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to file a motion to sever the resisting arrest charge, by failing to\nobject to the police officers\u2019 testimony, and by failing to object to a flight instruction.\n\n(D.1. 9; D.1. 10)\n\nAlthough the Petitions challenge separate convictions, they involve a common\nquestion of law and fact and raise at least one identical ground for relief. Therefore, the\nCourt will consider both Petitions in this proceeding. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(2).\n\nll. | GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences . . .\nand to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d Woodford v. Garceau,\n538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas\npetition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of\n\nthe Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).\n7\nAdditionally, AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for analyzing the\nmerits of a habeas petition in order to \u201cprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure\nthat state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d Bell v.\nCone, 535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002).\nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v.\nConnor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states, in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\n\nshall not be granted unless it appears that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the\ncourts of the State; or\n\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective\n\nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such process\n\nineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of comity,\ngives \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking\none complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan,\n526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the\n\nhabeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct\nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court\n\nto consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005);\n\nCastille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised the issue on direct\n\n8\nappeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted and the petitioner does\nnot need to raise the same issue again in a state post-conviction proceeding. See\nLambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and further\nstate court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the federal\ncourt will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted. See\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet{] the\ntechnical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer available);\nsee also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims, however, are\nprocedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153,\n160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state\u2019s\nhighest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the merits of the\nclaim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted\nbut procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S.\n255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims\nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if\nthe court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260\n(3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause for a procedural\ndefault, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor external to the defense\nimpeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier,\n\n477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show that\nthe errors during his trial created more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that\nthe errors worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial\nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d /d. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d2 then a federal court\ncan excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451\n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). The miscarriage of justice\nexception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means factual\ninnocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623\n(1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual innocence by asserting\n\u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy\neyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u2014that was not presented at trial,\u201d\nshowing that no reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Hubbard v. Pinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nC. Standard of Review\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the\nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if\nthe state court's decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts\n\n2Murray, 477 U.S. at 496.\n10\nbased on the evidence adduced in the trial. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see also Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn, 250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001). A\nclaim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d) if the state\ncourt decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a\nprocedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir.\n2009). The deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court's order is\nunaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cit\nmay be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the\nabsence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d /d. at 99.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the\nstate court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This\npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is\nonly rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1);\nCampbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S.\n322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies\nto factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2)\napplies to factual decisions).\nlil. | DISCUSSION\n\nA. Claim One: Violation Of Petitioner's Fourth Amendment Rights\n\nIn Claim One, Petitioner contends that his Fourth Amendment rights were\nviolated in both the C and D Cases because the State \u201cused illegally obtain[ed]\nevidence in [his] trial and [the] evidence should have been suppressed.\u201d (D.I. 2 at 5; D.I.\n\n2-1 at 2; D.I. 9 at 5; D.I. 10 at 2) Petitioner argues that the police illegally detained his\n11\nsister \u201cby placing her in handcuffs upon contact\u201d after illegally entering her residence\n\u201cwithout a warrant, without justification, without valid consent.\u201d (D.I. 3 at 4; D.I. 10 at 4)\nHe argues that \u201cany and all evidence and contraband located inside the residence\u201d\nshould have been suppressed for being \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d (D.I. 3 at 4; D.I. 10\nat 4) For the following reasons, the Court concludes that Claim One does not warrant\nrelief.\n\nPursuant to Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 494 (1976), a federal habeas court\ncannot review a Fourth Amendment claim if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity\nto litigate the claim in the state courts. /d.; see also Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 293\n(1992). A petitioner is considered to have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate such\nclaims if the state has an available mechanism for suppressing evidence seized in or\ntainted by an illegal search or seizure, irrespective of whether the petitioner actually\navailed himself of that mechanism. See U.S. ex rel. Hickey v. Jeffes, 571 F.2d 762, 766\n(3d.Cir. 1980); Boyd v. Mintz, 631 F.2d 247, 250 (3d Cir. 1980). Conversely, a\npetitioner has not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim,\nand therefore, avoids the Stone bar, if the state system contains a structural defect that\nprevented the state court from fully and fairly hearing that Fourth Amendment argument.\nMarshall v. Hendricks, 307 F.3d 36, 82 (3d Cir. 2002). Significantly, \u201can erroneous or\nsummary resolution by a state court of a Fourth Amendment claim does not overcome\nthe [Stone] bar.\u201d /d.\n\nIn this case, Petitioner filed a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence obtained\nfrom his sister's residence pursuant to Rule 41 of the Delaware Superior Court Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure (D.I. 22-5 at 54-58), and the Superior Court denied that motion after\n\n12\nconducting a hearing. (D.I. 22-5 at 105-109) Petitioner then challenged that decision in\nhis direct appeals of both the C and D Cases to the Delaware Supreme Court,\npresenting the same argument raised here. The Delaware Supreme Court in the C\nCase found \u201c[t]o the extent [Petitioner] challenges . . . the validity of Lutricia Ingram\u2019s\nconsent on appeal, those claims were raised and rejected at trial and are without merit.\u201d\nIngram, 2014 7465977, at *3. When addressing Petitioner's instant Fourth Amendment\nargument in the D Case, the Delaware Supreme Court referenced its earlier order\naffirming Petitioner\u2019s convictions in the C case, and concluded, \u201chaving previously\nconsidered [Petitioner's] direct challenge to the validity of his sister's consent and\ndenied the claim as without merit, the Court concludes that the same claim raised in this\nappeal is moot.\u201d Ingram, 2015 WL 631581, at *3.\n\nThis record clearly demonstrates that Petitioner was afforded a full and fair\nopportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment Claim for both the C and D Cases in the\nDelaware state courts. The fact that Petitioner disagrees with these decisions and/or\nthe reasoning utilized therein is insufficient to overcome the Stone bar. Therefore, the\nCourt will deny Petitioner's Fourth Amendment argument as barred by Stone.\n\nB. Claim Two: Insufficient Evidence In Case D (PFBPP)\n\nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that his right to due process was violated\nduring the trial in Case D \u201cwhen the State did not meet its burden of proof, [because t]he\nState . . . [relied] on the testimony of two officers [who] didn't witness the weapon in\nquestion until after [Petitioner] was in custody.\u201d (D.I. 2-1 at 2) Specifically, Petitioner\nargues that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was in\n\nconstructive possession of the weapon on the day of his arrest, September 27, 2012.\n\n13\n(D.I. 2-1 at 4) The Delaware Supreme Court rejected this argument as meritless in\nPetitioner's direct appeal of the D Case. Therefore, Petitioner will only be entitled to\nrelief if the Delaware Supreme Court's denial of Claim Two was either contrary to, or\nbased on an unreasonable application of, United States Supreme Court precedent.\n\nThe clearly established federal law governing Petitioner's insufficient evidence\nargument is the rule articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Jackson v.\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Pursuant to Jackson, \u201cthe relevant question is whether,\nafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational\ntrier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\u201d /d. at 319. This standard \u201cmust be applied with explicit reference to the\nsubstantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d /d. at 324 n.16.\nAdditionally, \u201ca federal habeas court faced with a record of historical facts that supports\nconflicting inferences must presume \u2014 even if it does not affirmatively appear in the\nrecord \u2014 that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and\nmust defer to that resolution.\u201d /d. at 326; see also Gov't of Virgin Islands v. Isaac, 50\nF.3d 1175, 1179 (3d Cir. 1995). Reviewing courts cannot make their own credibility\ndeterminations when evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence. See United States v.\nGiampa, 758 F.2d 928, 934-35 (3d Cir. 1985). Finally, \u201cit is not necessary that the\nevidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d Jackson, 443 U.S.\nat 326.\n\nHere, although the Delaware Supreme Court did not cite to Jackson when it\ndenied the instant Claim, it relied on Delaware caselaw articulating the Jackson\n\nstandard applicable to such claims. See Fahy v. Hom, 516 F.3d 169, 196 (3d Cir. 2008)\n\n14\n(Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established\nfederal law because it appropriately relied on its own state court cases which articulated\nthe proper standard derived from Supreme Court precedent). Thus, the Delaware\nSupreme Court's decision is not contrary to clearly established law.\n\nIn addition, the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied Jackson to the facts\nof Petitioner's case. At the conclusion of the trial in the D Case, Petitioner moved for a\njudgment of acquittal on the PFBPP charge. (D.I. 22-13, at 191) Defense counsel\nargued that there was no evidence that Petitioner actually or constructively possessed\nthe gun, given the lack of evidence that Petitioner was even aware of the loaded\nhandgun under the couch. (/d.) The Superior Court denied the motion. (/d.) On direct\nappeal, the Delaware Supreme Court found the evidence was sufficient to convict\nPetitioner of PFBPP, determining that \u201c[t]wo police officers testified that, when struggling\nwith them in the living room of his sister's apartment on September 27, Petitioner made\nrepeated attempts to reach under the couch in an area where the police officer later\ndiscovered a loaded handgun.\u201d Ingram, 2015 WL 631581, at *2.\n\nIn Delaware, to \u201cprove constructive possession of a gun, the State must show\nthat the defendant: (i) knew the location of the gun; (ii) had the ability to exercise\ndominion and control over the gun; and (iii) intended to exercise dominion and control\nover the gun.\u201d Triplett v. State, 2014 WL 1888414, at *2 (Del. May 9, 2014); Lecates v.\nState, 987 A.2d 413, 426 (Del. 2009). When determining if there was sufficient\nevidence, the Delaware Supreme Court does not distinguish between direct and\n\ncircumstantial evidence. See Lum v. State, 101 A.3d 970, 971 (Del. 2014).\n\n15\nIn this case, the jury was presented with evidence that Petitioner was a person\nprohibited, he was alone in the apartment during the encounter with police, the police\nofficers witnessed Petitioner repeatedly reaching under the couch, and a loaded gun\nwas immediately found under that same couch once the officers had Petitioner in\ncustody. After viewing the totality of the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn\nfrom that evidence in a light most favorable to the State, the Court concludes that the\nDelaware Supreme Court reasonably applied Jackson when holding that a reasonable\ntrier of fact could find there was sufficient evidence of constructive possession to find\nPetitioner guilty of PFBPP. Therefore, Claim Two does not warrant relief under \u00a7\n2254(d).\n\nC. Claim Three: Evidentiary Violations In The C Case (Robbery and\nResisting Arrest) Deprived Petitioner Of His Due Process Rights\n\nNext, Petitioner contends that the State committed two evidentiary errors during\nhis trial in the C Case that \u201c[vJiolated [his] constitutional right to a fair trial and a right to\nDue Process.\u201d (D.I. 10 at 11-12) Specifically, he complains that the State failed to\nauthenticate the gun as required by Delaware Rule of Evidence 901 and the State failed\nto comply with Delaware Rules of Evidence 401, 402, and 403 when admitting the pack\nof Newport cigarettes containing his thumbprint.\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that \u201cit is not the province of a federal\nhabeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state law questions.\u201d Estelle\nv. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 68 (1991). The \u201cadmissibility of evidence is a state law\n\nissue,\u201d> and state evidentiary errors are not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus\n\n3Wilson v. Vaughn, 533 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir. 2008).\n16\nproceeding unless the error deprived the petitioner of fundamental fairness in his\ncriminal trial. See Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 642-43 (1974).\n\nAlthough Claim Two briefly asserts that the admission of the gun violated\nPetitioner's right to due process, the clear thrust of the instant Claim is that the Superior\nCourt erroneously applied Delaware evidentiary rules when admitting the gun as\nevidence. Thus, the Court concludes that Claim Three is not cognizable in this\nproceeding.\n\nEven if Claim Three were cognizable, the Claim is procedurally barred from\nhabeas review due to Petitioner's failure to satisfy the \u201cfair presentation\u201d requirement of\nthe exhaustion doctrine. A federal legal claim is \u201cfairly presented\u201d to state courts when\nthere is: (1) reliance in the state courts on pertinent federal cases employing\nconstitutional analysis; (2) reliance on state cases employing constitutional analysis in\nlike fact situations; (3) assertion of the claim in terms so particular as to call to mind a\nspecific right protected by the Constitution; and (4) allegation of a pattern of facts that is\nwell within the mainstream of constitutional litigation. See McCandless, 172 F.3d at\n261. As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cif a habeas petitioner wishes to claim that an\nevidentiary ruling at a state court trial denied him the due process of law guaranteed by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, he must say so, not only in federal court, but in state court.\u201d\nDuncan v. Henry, 513 U.S. 364, 366 (1995).\n\nThe record reveals that Petitioner presented his arguments in Claim Three to the\nDelaware Supreme Court on direct appeal of the C Case purely as errors of Delaware\nevidentiary law and not as a violation of his due process rights. (See D.I. 22-4 at 32-36,\n\n42); Ingram, 2014 WL 7465977, at *2-3. While Petitioner's failure to frame his argument\n\n17\nwith the explicit phrase \u201cdue process\u201d is not necessarily determinative of this inquiry,\nPetitioner did not reference any federal constitutional principle or law, refer to any case\ninterpreting federal constitutional law, or present his argument in terms bringing to mind\na violation of due process. The fact that the Delaware Supreme Court also viewed\nPetitioner's argument as alleging that the trial court erred in its \u201cevidentiary rulings\u201d\nprovides additional support for the Court\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner did not \u201cfairly\npresent\u201d a due process violation on direct appeal. See Ingram, 2014 WL 7465977, at\n*2. In turn, Petitioner did not present a violation of due process argument based on any\nalleged evidentiary errors in his amended Rule 61 motion or post-conviction appeal in\nthe C Case. Given this record, the Court concludes that the Petitioner did not exhaust\nstate remedies for Claim Three because he did not fairly present the Claim to the\nDelaware Supreme Court as a federal due process issue.\n\nAt this point in time, Petitioner cannot return to the Delaware state courts in an\neffort to seek further relief because any attempt to file a new Rule 61 motion would be\ndenied as time-barred under Rule 61(i)(1), successive under Rule 61(i)(2), and\ndefaulted under Rule 61(i)(3). See Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(1), (2), (3). Therefore,\nClaim Three is procedurally defaulted, meaning that the Court cannot review the Claim\u2019s\nmerits absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or that fundamental miscarriage of\njustice will result absent such review.\n\nPetitioner attempts to establish cause for his default of Claim Three by blaming\npost-conviction counsel for not including the Claim in the amended Rule 61 motion and\non post-conviction appeal. (D.I. 26 at 3-5) To the extent Petitioner premises his\n\nattempt to establish cause under Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012), the argument is\n\n18\nunavailing. In Martinez, the Supreme Court held that inadequate assistance of counsel\nduring an initial-review state collateral proceeding may establish cause for a petitioner's\nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. /d. at 16-17. In\norder to obtain relief under Martinez, a petitioner must demonstrate that: (1) the\ndefaulted ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim is substantial; and (2) the post-\nconviction attorney in his first state collateral proceeding was ineffective under the\nstandards established in Strickland. See Workman v. Sup't Albion SCI, 915 F.3d 928,\n937 (3d Cir. 2019). Here, however, Claim Three asserts an alleged due process/state\nevidentiary violation, not an argument that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.\nTherefore, Martinez does not provide an avenue for Petitioner to establish cause for his\ndefault of the instant Claim.\n\nIn the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue of prejudice.\nAdditionally, Petitioner has not satisfied the miscarriage of justice exception to the\nprocedural default doctrine because he has not provided new reliable evidence of his\nactual innocence. Accordingly, to the extent it is cognizable, the Court will deny Claim\nThree as procedurally barred.\n\nD. Claim Four: Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\nIn Claim Four, Petitioner contends that defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance in both the C and D Cases, and presents his ineffective assistance\narguments by appending his Rule 61 pleadings to his Petitions. The Superior Court\ndenied Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel arguments, and the Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed those decisions. See Ingram, 2019 WL 2537735, at *1 (C\n\nCase); Ingram, 2019 WL 2537627, at *1 (D Case). Given these circumstances,\n\n19\nPetitioner will only be entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel\nallegations if the Delaware Supreme Court decisions in the C and D Cases were either\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\n\nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510\n(2003). Under the first Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel's\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with\nreasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel\nrendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second Strickland prong,\na petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\nerror the result would have been different.\u201d /d. at 687-96. A reasonable probability is a\n\u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d /d. at 688. A court may\nchoose to address the prejudice prong before the deficient performance prong, and may\nreject an ineffectiveness claim solely on the ground that the movant was not prejudiced.\nSee Strickland, 466 U.S. at 668. Although not insurmountable, the Strickland standard\nis highly demanding and leads to a strong presumption that counsel's representation\nwas professionally reasonable. See id. at 689.\n\nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that the\nDelaware Supreme Court correctly identified the Strickland standard as governing\nPetitioner's instant ineffective assistance of counsel contentions. As a result, the\nDelaware Supreme Court's decisions were not contrary to clearly established federal\n\nlaw.\n\n20\nThe Court must also determine if the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably\napplied the Strickland standard to the facts of Petitioner's case. See Harrington, 562\nU.S. at 105-06. When performing this inquiry, the Court must review the Delaware\nSupreme Court's denial of Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel allegation\nthrough a \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens. /d. \u201c[T]he question is not whether counsel's actions\nwere reasonable, [but rather], whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel\nsatisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d /d. When assessing prejudice under\nStrickland, the question is \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result would have been\ndifferent\u201d but for counsel's performance, and the \u201clikelihood of a different result must be\nsubstantial, not just conceivable.\u201d /d. And finally, when viewing a state court's\ndetermination that a Strickland claim lacks merit through the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal\nhabeas relief is precluded \u201cso long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the\ncorrectness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d /d. at 101.\n\n1. The C Case\n\nWith respect to the C Case (Robbery and Resisting Arrest), Petitioner asserts\nthat defense counsel was ineffective for: \u201c(1) not moving to sever the resisting-arrest\ncharge from the charges that related to the robbery, (2) not objecting to testimony from\nthe arresting officer at trial that he recognized [Petitioner] and that it was difficult to\narrest [Petitioner], and (3) not objecting to a flight instruction.\u201d Ingram, 2019 WL\n2537735, at *1; (D.I. 10 at 32-49; D.I. 22-20 at 72-90) The Superior Court held that\ndefense counsel did not provide ineffective assistance, opining:\n\n[E]ven if a motion to sever the Resisting arrest charge had\nbeen made there was, as noted by the State, sufficient\n\nevidentiary value in the testimony concerning [Petitioner's]\nactions during his arrest and the finding of a loaded weapon\n\n21\nthat matched the description of the weapon used in the\nRobbery, that the evidence would have been admitted at the\ntrial because it was relevant. Furthermore, | find that there was\nno prejudice due to the strong evidence linking [Petitioner] to\nthe crime. His fingerprints on the cigarette pack found along\nthe path the suspect with the contraband fled is compelling to\nsay the least. Consequently, the testimony concerning the\narrest was relevant and outweighed any potential prejudice to\nIngram. The charges were properly joined.\n\n| further find Trial Counsel was not ineffective for failing to\nobject to various lines of questioning. As noted in the\namended brief, Trial Counsel, during trial chose not to object\ndue to the tactical reasons. Under the circumstances of the\ncase | find his actions reasonable. Furthermore, | do not find\nthat the lack of objection prejudiced Ingram given the weight\nof evidence against him.\n\nFinally turning to the allegation that Trial Counsel should have\nopposed a flight instruction, | find this ground meritless. The\nrecord clearly shows that there was sufficient evidence\npresented during the trial to warrant a flight instruction.\nConsequently there was no prejudice to Ingram.\n\nIngram, 2018 WL 3459209, at *5-6. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the\nSuperior Court's denial of the instant ineffective assistance arguments, opining:\n\n[Petitioner] has not demonstrated that either the failure to\nmove to sever [the resisting arrest charge] or the failure to\nobject to the arresting officer's testimony was prejudicial to his\ndefense. In particular, [Petitioner] did not show that it is likely\nthat a court would have excluded significant portions of the\narrest evidence from a severed trial on the robbery charges or\nthat the arresting officer's testimony weighed significantly\nupon the jury's verdict. Nor did [Petitioner] convincingly\nexplain why a flight instruction was unwarranted given that it\nwas undisputed that the robbery suspects fled down a bike\npath and that police found a pack of unopened Newport\ncigarettes\u2014with [Petitioner's] fingerprint\u2014along that bike\npath. Given all that, we cannot conclude that \u201cthere was\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel's [alleged]\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different.\n\n22\nAlso, [Petitioner] has not shown that trial counsel's failure to\nobject to the arresting officer's testimony \u201cfell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness.\u201d To be sure, the\narresting officer's testimony that, when he entered the\napartment where he arrested [Petitioner], he immediately\nrecognized [Petitioner] might have led the jury to infer that\n[Petitioner] had prior police contacts. But that is not the only\ninference to be drawn, and even if it were, [Petitioner] has not\nexplained why trial counsel's failure to object was not a\nreasonable trial strategy that sought to avoid drawing\n\u201cunwarranted attention\u201d to potentially damaging testimony.\nIngram, 2019 WL 2537735, at *1 (cleaned up).\n\nThe Delaware state courts did not unreasonably apply Strickland when denying\nPetitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel arguments concerning the C Case. With\nrespect to defense counsel's failure to pursue severance of the resisting arrest charge,\nthe record supports the Superior Court's explicit finding, and the Delaware Supreme\nCourt's implicit finding, that Petitioner's fingerprint on the pack of cigarettes found with\nthe other items stolen during the robbery constituted \u201cstrong evidence linking\u201d Petitioner\nto the robbery. See Ingram, 2018 WL 3459209, at *5; Ingram, 2019 WL 2537735, at *1.\nConsequently, the testimony regarding Petitioner's resisting arrest conduct on\nSeptember 27, 2012 would have been relevant and admissible at a severed trial on the\nrobbery charges. See, e.g., McKinney v. State, 466 A.2d 356, 359 (Del. 1983) (\u201cUnder\na plea of not guilty, any conduct of the defendant subsequent to the commission of the\ncrime, that tends to show consciousness of guilt, is relevant.) Thus, the Delaware\nSupreme Court reasonably applied Strickland when concluding Petitioner failed to\ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of his trial in the C Case would\n\nhave been different but for defense counsel's failure to file a motion to sever because\n\nhe \u201cdid not show that it is likely that a court would have excluded significant portions of\n\n23\nthe arrest evidence from a severed trial on the robbery charges.\u201d Ingram, 2019 WL\n25377365, at *1.\n\nPetitioner's contention regarding defense counsel's failure to oppose the flight\ninstruction is similarly unavailing. Under Delaware state law, \u201c[t]he trial court may\ninstruct the jury on defendant's flight where the record contains evidence of flight or\nconcealment and the evidence reasonably supports the inference that defendant fled\nbecause of a consciousness of guilt and a desire to avoid accusation thereon.\u201d Daniels\nv. State, 703 A.2d 643 (Table), 1997 WL 776202, at *3 (Del. Dec. 4, 1997). Here,\nPetitioner contends that the flight instruction was improper because \u201cthere was no\nevidence presented at trial that identified [Petitioner] at the scene or fleeing from the\nscene.\u201d (D.I. 10 at 47; D.I. 22-20 at 86) In rejecting that argument and determining that\nthe flight instruction was warranted both the Superior Court and the Delaware Supreme\nCourt expressly relied on the record, which included the following evidence: (1) the\npolice saw three individuals fitting the description from the 911 call fleeing the scene\nshortly after the robbery (D.|. 22-5 at 316-317); (2) two of the three suspects were\napprehended within minutes of the robbery; (3) Petitioner's thumbprint was found on an\nunopened pack of Newport cigarettes on the same path where the police apprehended\nthe other two suspects; and (4) packs of Newport cigarettes were part of the items\nstolen from the store. See Ingram, 2019 WL 2537735, at *1; see also Ingram, 2018 WL\n3459209, at *5-*6. This evidence demonstrates the reasonableness of the Delaware\nstate courts\u2019 determination that a flight instruction was warranted. Consequently,\n\nPetitioner cannot establish a reasonable probability that an objection would have been\n\n24\ngranted and, therefore, cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability of a different\noutcome had defense counsel opposed the flight instruction.\n\nThe Court also concludes that Petitioner's complaint about defense counsel's\nfailure to object to Detective Bumgarner\u2019s testimony does not warrant relief. When\nrejecting Petitioner's contention that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object\nto Detective Bumgarner's testimony that he recognized Petitioner upon entering the\napartment (D.I. 29-19 at 28) and that Petitioner\u2019s conduct during the arrest was worse\nthan that of other individuals the detective had arrested, (D.1. 29-19 at 56), the Superior\nCourt noted that, \u201cduring trial, [defense counsel] chose not to object due to tactical\nreasons.\u201d Ingram, 2018 WL 3459209, at *5. In affirming that decision, the Delaware\nSupreme Court pointed to Petitioner's failure to \u201cexplain[] why trial counsel's failure to\nobject was not a reasonable trial strategy that sought to avoid drawing \u2018unwarranted\nattention\u2019 to potentially damaging testimony.\u201d Ingram, 2019 WL 2537735, at *1. The\nDelaware Supreme Court\u2019s reference to defense counsel's \u201ctactical reasons\u201d is based\non an entry the trial judge put on the record after a sidebar regarding Detective\nBumgarner\u2019s testimony:\n\n[During[ the redirect of a witness, there was a string of leading\nquestions. It was not objected to. Then, at the close of that,\n[defense counsel asked about something, but because there\nwas no objection, there would be no instruction to the jury to\ndisregard them. | did offer defense counsel to state something\non the record in the presence of the jury, but chose as a\ntactical matter not to.\n\n(D.I. 22-19 at 74-75) Defense counsel's Rule 61 affidavit does not provide any reason\n\nfor counsel's failure to object. (See D.1. 22-20 at 91-92).\n\n25\nUnder Strickland, counsel is entitled to a strong presumption that his conduct\nwas within the range of \u201creasonable professional assistance\u201d and, \u201cwhere, as here, the\nrecord is silent as to counsel's strategy or lack thereof, the defendant bears the burden\nof proving that no sound strategy offered by the [State] would have supported the\nconduct.\u201d Lewis v. Hom, 581 F.3d 92, 114 (3d Cir. 2009). The Delaware Supreme\nCourt concluded that defense counsel's failure to object to Detective Bumgarner's\ntestimony did not amount to deficient performance because Petitioner failed to rebut the\nStrickland presumption that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object may have been \u201ca\nreasonable trial strategy that sought to avoid drawing unwarranted attention to\npotentially damaging testimony.\u201d /ngram, 2019 WL 2537735, at *1 (cleaned up). Given\nPetitioner's failure to provide any evidence to rebut the Strickland presumption that the\nchallenged action might be considered sound trial strategy, the Court will deny the\ninstant ineffective assistance contention for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n2. The D Case\n\nWith respect to the D Case (PFBPP on day of arrest), Petitioner contends that\ndefense counsel provided ineffective assistance by not calling a police officer to testify\nthat he had processed the firearm for fingerprints and had found none, and by failing to\npresent the results of the DNA test from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner\n(\u201cOCME\u201d) to show there was no link between the gun and Petitioner. Petitioner\npresented the instant two arguments in his Rule 61 motion, asserting that these pieces\n\nof evidence \u2014 which were well-known to counsel due to counsel\u2019s representation of\n\n\u2018Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n26\nPetitioner in the C Case5 \u2014 would have \u201ccreate[d] reasonable doubt as to whether\n[Petitioner] had the power and the intention to exercise control over the firearm under\nthe couch.\u201d (D.I. 2-2 at 16-20; D.I. 22-27 at 88)\n\nAs both the Superior Court and Delaware Supreme Court explained when\nrejecting these ineffective assistance arguments in Petitioner's Rule 61 proceeding,\nsince Petitioner stipulated that he was person prohibited from possessing a firearm on\nSeptember 27, 2012, the only issue before the jury was whether there was proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner either had actual or constructive possession\nof the firearm. See Ingram, 2018 WL 3126096, at *9; Ingram, 2019 WL 2537627, at *1.\nBoth state courts concluded that Petitioner could not demonstrate a reasonable\nprobability that a jury would have acquitted Petitioner even if it had heard the evidence\nabout the lack of Petitioner's DNA and fingerprints on the gun because of credible\ntestimony concerning Petitioner\u2019s constructive possession provided by two police\nofficers who were involved in Petitioner's arrest on September 27, 2012. See Ingram,\n2018 WL 3126096, at *3-*8, *9-*10.\n\nThe Court begins its analysis of Petitioner's instant contention by reviewing the\nrelevant testimony from Petitioner's D Case. Detective Bumgamer testified that: (1) he\nwas the first person to enter the apartment and, when he drew his rifle and confronted\n\nPetitioner in the living room, Petitioner reached for the rifle (D.1. 22-26 at 75-77); (2)\n\n5At Petitioner's separate robbery trial (C Case), Detective Simpkiss testified that he\ntested the firearm for fingerprints using two different methods, but neither method\nyielded any prints. (D.I. 22-5 at 517-526) Additionally, the OCME\u2019s March 6, 2013\nreport analyzing the firearm for DNA concluded that \u201c[t]he DNA profile of the evidentiary\nsample . . . is consistent with being a mixture containing the DNA of at least two\nindividuals, of which at least one is male. No conclusions can be made as to the\ninclusion or exclusion of [Petitioner].\u201d (D.I. 22-27 at 141-143)\n\n27\nconcerned for his safety, Detective Bumgarner knocked Petitioner down, and Petitioner\nwas on \u201con the ground and on his back looking up\u201d while Detective Bumgarner\ndemanded that Petitioner show his hands (D.I. 22-26 at 77); (3) while Petitioner was\nlying on his back, Petitioner used his feet to scoot toward the couch, and was reaching\nunder the couch with one of his hands (/d.); (4) Detective Bumgarner kicked Petitioner,\nwho was still reaching under the couch while \u201calmost rolling onto his stomach\u201d (D.1. 22-\n26 at 77-78); (5) several other officers jumped on Petitioner and tried to secure his\nhands while he continued to reach under the couch (D.I. 22-26 at 78); and (6) Detective\nBumgarner and another officer searched the apartment to ensure that no one else was\nthere. (D.I. 22-26 at 79) Officer Willson testified that he entered the apartment behind\nDetective Bumgarner, and when he reached the living room, several officers were\nalready apprehending Petitioner, who was lying on his stomach and reaching under the\ncouch. (D.I. 22-26 at 96-99) After arresting Petitioner, the police searched under the\ncouch and found a loaded firearm. (D.I. 22-26 at 103)\n\nThe foregoing testimony was sufficient to establish that Petitioner constructively\npossessed the loaded gun found under the couch. Even if defense counsel arguably\nshould have presented the lack of fingerprint and DNA evidence on the gun, Petitioner\ncannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have been found guilty\nof PFBPP but for defense counsel\u2019s counsel failure to introduce the inconclusive\nfindings of a police officer's search of the firearm for fingerprints and the OCME\u2019s DNA\nreport. Therefore, the Court will deny Petitioner's assertion of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel in the D Case for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n28\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nThe Court must decide whether to issue a certificate of appealabilty. See 3d Cir.\nL.A.R. 22.2 (2011). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes\na \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat\nreasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims\ndebatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,\n484 (2000). Additionally, if a federal court denies a habeas petition on procedural\ngrounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required\nto issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of\nreason would find debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of\na constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling. See\nSlack, 529 U.S. at 484.\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition fails to warrant federal habeas\nrelief. Reasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly,\nthe Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.\n\nVv. | CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will deny the instant Petition without\n\nan evidentiary hearing. The Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum\n\nOpinion.\n\n29\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nARLANDO INGRAM,\nPetitioner,\nv. : Civil Action No. 19-2084-CFC\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this Ninth day of February in 2023, for the reasons set forth\nin the Memorandum Opinion issued this date;\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1. Petitioner Arlando Ingram\u2019s Petitions for a Writ of Habeas Corpus\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (D.1. 2; D.I. 3; D.I. 9; D.I. 10) are DISMISSED, and the\nrelief requested therein is DENIED.\n\n2. The Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because\n\nPetitioner has failed to satisfy the standards set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The\n\nColm F. Ld GM\n\nChief Judge\n\nClerk shall close the case.\n\n"}
