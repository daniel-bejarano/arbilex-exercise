No. 22-031-CFC\nSTATE OF DELAWARE, et al., ;\n\nDefendants.\n\nJoel R. Stevenson, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDecember 16, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nCLF. a\nCONNOLLY, Chief Judge:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Joel R. Stevenson, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in\nSmyrna, Delaware, filed this lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 1) He appears\npro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. He has filed a\nrequest for counsel. (D.I. 10) The Court proceeds to review and screen the matter\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.\n2008). Plaintiff does not know exactly when the alleged actions took place but says\nthey occurred while he while he was on PCO (i.e., psychological close observation)\nstatus. The Complaint is best described as containing a litany of alleged wrongful acts\nthat are not directed to any defendant except Officer Dodson. (See D.I. 1 at 6)\n\nPlaintiff seeks 27 million dollars in compensatory damages and injunctive relief.\n(Id. at 8)\nlll. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A\\(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison\nconditions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny,\n515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because\nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever\ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings\ndrafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Weitzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\ndeciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d\nCir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to\namend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v.\n\nMayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine\nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v.\nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that\n\nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. [qbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Eleventh Amendment\n\nThe State of Delaware and the Delaware Department of Correction are named\ndefendants. They are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The\nDelaware Department of Correction is an agency of the State of Delaware. As an\nagency of the State of Delaware, it is immune from suit. See Jones v. Sussex\nCorrectional Institute, 725 F. App\u2019x 157, 159 (3d Cir. 2017). The Eleventh Amendment\nprotects states and their agencies and departments from suit in federal court regardless\nof the kind of relief sought. Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n100 (1984). \u201cAbsent a state\u2019s consent, the Eleventh Amendment bars a civil rights suit\nin federal court that names the state as a defendant.\u201d Laskaris v. Thornburgh, 661 F.2d\n23, 25 (3d Cir. 1981) (citing Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781 (1978)). Delaware has not\nwaived its immunity from suit in federal court; although Congress can abrogate a state's\nsovereign immunity, it did not do so through the enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See\nJones, 725 F. App\u2019x 157 at 159-160.\n\nThe State of Delaware and the DOC will be dismissed based on their Eleventh\nAmendment immunity from suit.\n\nB. Respondeat Superior\n\nJTVCC Warden and JTVCC Deputy Warden are named defendants. The claims\n\nagainst the Warden and Deputy Warden appear to be based upon their supervisory\npositions. There is no respondeat superior liability under \u00a7 1983. See Parkell v.\nDanberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\nA defendant in a civil rights action \u201ccannot be held responsible for a constitutional\nviolation which he [ ] neither participated in nor approved\u201d; personal involvement in the\nalleged wrong is required. Baraka v. McGreevey, 481 F.3d 187, 210 (3d Cir. 2007); see\nalso Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 325, (1981) (holding that liability in a \u00a7 1983\naction must be based on personal involvement, not respondeat superior). Such\ninvolvement may be \u201cshown through allegations of personal direction or of actual\nknowledge and acquiescence.\u201d Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\nThe Complaint contains no allegations directed towards the Warden and the\nDeputy Warden must less allege the personal involvement required for a \u00a7 1983 claim.\nTherefore, towards the Warden and the Deputy Warden will be dismissed as\ndefendants.\n\nCc. Excessive Force\n\nPlaintiff has alleged what appears to be a cognizable excessive force claim\nagainst Defendant Dodson.\n\nD. Request for Counsel\n\nPlaintiff requests the help of legal counsel. (D.I. 10) A pro se litigant proceeding\nin forma pauperis has no constitutional or statutory right to representation by counsel.\nSee Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d\n147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993). However, representation by counsel may be appropriate under\ncertain circumstances, after a finding that a plaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact\n\nand law. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the court should consider a number of factors\nwhen assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in deciding\nwhether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the merits of\nthe plaintiff's claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her case considering his or\nher education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon him or her by\nincarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to which factual\ninvestigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue such investigation; (5) the\nplaintiff's capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and (6) the degree to\nwhich the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony. See\nMontgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155-56.\nThe list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.\n\nAssuming, solely for the purpose of deciding this motion, that Plaintiff's claims\nhave merit in fact and law, several of the Tabron factors militate against granting his\nrequest for counsel at this time. Plaintiff provides no grounds for his request for counsel\nand no party has been served. The request will be denied without prejudice to renew.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiffs request for counsel\nwithout prejudice to renew (D.I. 10); (2) dismiss the State of Delaware, the Delaware\nDepartment of Correction, the Warden, and the Deputy Warden and the claims against\nthem as legally frivolous pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and 1915A(b)(1); and\n(3) allow Plaintiff to proceed against Officer Dodson.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n"}
