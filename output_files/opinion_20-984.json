{"case_name": "Prolitec Inc. v. ScentAir Technologies, LLC", "case_number": "20-984", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "01-05-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPROLITEC , INC., \nPlaintiff, Counter-Defendant , \nV. \nSCENTAIR TECHNOLOGIES , LLC, \nDefendant , Counter-Plaintiff. Civil Action No. 20-984-RGA-MPT \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nThe parties submitted a Joint Claim Construction Brief in December 2022. (D.I. 107). I \nissued an order construing terms from Defendant 's asserted patents. (D.I. 119). I heard oral \nargument on the terms in Plaintiff's asserted patents on January 3, 2023. I ruled on most of the \nterms at the Markman hearing. This Memorandum Order addresses the single claim term I took \nunder advisement after the hearing: \"assists in preventing liquid from leaking.\" \nThe term appears in claim 17 of U.S. Patent No. 9,162,004 (\"the '004 patent\") and claim \n16 of U.S. Patent No. 9,745,976 (\"the '976 patent\"). Both claims depend on claim 9 of their \nrespective patents. Both claims read, in relevant part, \"The cartridge of claim 9 wherein the \ntortuous passage follows a non-linear path that assists in preventing liquid from leaking from \nthe cartridge when the cartridge is upended. \" ('004 patent at 20:3-5 (disputed term italicized and \nbolded)). Plaintiff proposes the construction: \"slows the progression or prevents the leakage of \nliquid.\" (D.I. 107 at 12). Defendant proposes the construction: \"contributes to stopping any \nliquid from leaving the device.\" Id. \n1 \nj There are two related disputes in the construction of this term: whether issue preclusion \napplies to the construction of this term, and whether the total prevention of leakage is a claim \nlimitation. I address each dispute in turn. \nIssue preclusion , also known as collateral estoppel, bars parties from re-litigating matters \nthat they had a full and fair opportunity to litigate. Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153 \n(1979). Issue preclusion consist of four elements : \"(1) identity of the issues in a prior proceeding; \n(2) the issues were actually litigated; (3) the determination of the issues was necessary to the \nresulting judgment ; and, ( 4) the party defending against preclusion had a full and fair opportunity \nto litigate the issues.\" Jet, Inc. v. Sewage Aeration Sys., 223 F.3d 1360, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. \n2000).1 \"[ A ]dministrative decisions by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office can [establish] \nissue preclusion in district court when the ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met.\" \nSkyHawke Techs., LLC v. DECA Int'! Corp., 828 F.3d 1373, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \nPlaintiff argues that issue preclusion requires the inclusion of the phrase \"slows the \nprogression \" in the construction , because Defendant argued in an inter partes review (IPR) \nproceeding that the claim term should encompass a passage that \"will assist in slowing the \nprogression ofliquid.\" (D.I. 107 at 15). The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) agreed, and \nPlaintiff contends that the PT AB 's agreement was necessary to its finding of invalidity of certain \nclaims. Id. Defendant argues that , regardless of issue preclusion, its current position is not \ninconsistent with its position before the PTAB. Id. at 16. \n1 In a patent case, the law of the regional circuit applies to issue preclusion generally and Federal \nCircuit precedent applies where the determination of issue preclusion involves substantive issues \nof patent law. Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps South, LLC, 735 F.3d 1333, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \nHere, the issue preclusion argument concerns patent claim construction. In any case, the \nelements of issue preclusion are the same under Third Circuit law. See Raytech Corp. v. White, \n54 F.3d 187, 190 (3d Cir. 1995). \n2 I do not think that issue preclusion applies here. The PT AB did not construe \"assists in \npreventing liquid from leaking\" or any related term in its IPR decision. Thus, the construction of \nthis term was not an actually litigated issue in the PT AB, and issue preclusion does not apply. I \ndecline to adopt Plaintiff's construction with the language \"slows the progression ,\" and I do not \nreach the issue of whether Defendant 's current position is consistent with its position at the \nPTAB. \nThe second issue is closely related but distinct. Adoption of Plaintiff's construction \nwould explicitly indicate that a device that allowed liquid to leak could still infringe the patent, \nsince the tortuous passage could \"slow the progression \" or \"prevent the leakage\" of the liquid. \nNot adopting Plaintiffs construction , however, does not imply that all devices that allow leakage \nare non-infringing. Defendant argues for a construction where a device must prevent \"any liquid\" \nfrom leaking. Defendant analogizes the claim term \"assists\" to the word's usage in sports, where \nan \"assist\" is only awarded when a point is successfull y scored. (D.I. 107 at 13). \nI disagree. Something may assist in achieving an outcome generally even if that outcome \nis not achieved in every case. Further, \"assists\" suggests that on its own, a tortuous passage \nwould not prevent liquid from leaking and that something else is required. The claim reads \n\"assists in preventing liquid from leaking from the cartridge when the cartridge is upended,\" \n('004 patent at 20:3-5), and the specification provides an example in which the \"something else\" \nconsists of the subsequent righting of the cartridge. ('004 patent at 10:49-58 ). Thus, the patent \nmust contemplate the possibility of some liquid leaking despite the aid of the tortuous passage if \nthe cartridge is not righted.2 Therefore , I decline to adopt Defendant 's construction. \n2 At oral argument, Defendant also contended that in the interest of claim differentiation , \n\"upended\" in claim 17 needed to be distinguished from \"temporarily held upside down\" in claim \n23. Despite the absence of the word \"temporarily ,\" I do not think \"upended\" can refer solely to a \n3 In fact, I do not think the term \"assists in preventing liquid for leaking\" requires \nconstruction. I adopt the term's plain and ordinary meaning as the Court's construction. \nDefendant may not argue that there is a limitation that liquid cannot leak. Within five days the \nparties shall submit a proposed Claim Construction Order consistent with this Memorandum \nOrder and the constructions adopted at the Markman hearing. \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \nEntered this 5' day of January, 2023 \nscenario where the cartridge is permanently upside down. The specification uses \"temporaril y \nheld upside down\" as an example of when the cartridge may be upended, so \"upended\" should \ninclude that scenario. \n4 "}
