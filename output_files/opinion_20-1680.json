Adams\u2019s (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \n\u201cAdams\u201d) Second Amended Complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  \n(D.I.  34).  For the reasons set forth below, Defendant\u2019s motion is DENIED.  \nI. INTRODUCTION \nA. Background  \nThe Delaware judiciary is composed of a half -dozen courts and relat ed judicial agencies.  \nSee An Overview of the Delaware Court System, DELAWARE COURTS (last visited \nSeptember  23, 2022), https://courts.delaware.gov/overview.aspx.  Article IV, \u00a7 3 of the Delaware \nConstitution contains two provisions that regulate the composition of certain of those courts.  The \nfirst, the \u201cbare majority requirement,\u201d ensures that no more than a bar e majority of those serving \nas judges on the Delaware Supreme Court, Court of Chancery, Superior Court, Family Court , and \nCourt of Common Pleas be affiliated with a single political party.  See Del. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 3.  \nThe second, the \u201cmajor political par ty\u201d provision, which applies to the Delaware Supreme Court, \nCourt of Chancery, and Superior Court, mandates that the remaining judges on those courts \u201cbe of the other major political party.\u201d\n1  Id.  So, for the three courts subject to both provisions (Supreme \nCourt, Court of Chancery, Superior Court), no more than a bare majority of justices or judges may be from a single political party, and the remaining justices or judges must be from the other major political party.  Thus, individuals who are not affil iated with either major party (either unaffiliated\n2 \n \n1  The Delaware Constitution does not define \u201cmajor political party.\u201d  See DEL. CONST . art. \nIV, \u00a7 3.  \n \n2  When individuals register to vote in Delaware, they are given the option to affiliate with a \npolitical party.  If they do not do so, they are registered as \u201cNo Party\u201d and are unaffiliated.  2 or affiliated with a political party that is not one of the two \u201cmajor\u201d parties) are unable to obtain \npositions on those three courts.   \nPlaintiff , currently an unaffiliated voter (D.I. 32 \u00b6 2) , alleges that the major political party \nprovision violates his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by barring him from being considered for a judgeship on the Superior Court, a position for which he twice applied and was \nrejected.  \nB. Litigation History  \nThis is Plain tiff\u2019s second challenge to Article IV, \u00a7 3 of the Delaware Constitution.  In his \nprior suit, Plaintiff asserted that both the bare majority and major political party provisions  violated \nhis First and Fourteenth Amendment right of political association.  ( C.A. No. 17-181-MPT, \nD.I. 10) (\u201cAdams I\u201d ).  At the time he filed his complaint in that case, Plaintiff had never applied \nto any judgeships, explaining that he felt that doing so would be futile and that he was \u201cinhibited from applying\u201d to a then -open vacanc y \u201cbecause of the announced limitation that the candidate \nhad to be a Republican.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6\u20137).  Plaintiff maintained, however, that he desired a judgeship, \nand sought to enjoin Delaware from using political affiliation as a criterion for the appointment  of \njudges, and also a declaration that the bare majority requirement was unconstitutional.  ( Id. at 11).  \nAfter discovery, which largely focused on Plaintiff\u2019s earnest desire to seek a judgeship, the \nparties cross -moved for summary judgment.  Plaintiff\u2019s motion centered on his argument that the \nbare majority and major political party requirements are unconstitutional because they condition government employment on political affiliation.  ( See C.A. No. 17- 181, D.I. 32).  Defendant\u2019s \nmotion both argued that Delaware\u2019s appointment scheme is constitutional and that Plaintiff lacked standing.  ( See C.A. No. 17\u2013181, D.I. 29).  Defendant pointed out that Plaintiff had not applied for \n \nSee Voter Registration , STATE OF DELAWARE  (last visited September 23, 2022), \nhttps://elections.delaware.gov/voter/votereg.shtml  3 a judgeship since 2009 and had no concrete plan to apply for or obtai n a judgeship.  ( Id. at 13).  \nFurther, Defendant explained that Plaintiff had been a Democrat his whole life, but changed his \npolitical affiliation to unaffiliated just ten days before filing suit.  ( Id. at 17 \u201318).  Plaintiff had also \nchanged his bar status from \u201cemeritus\u201d to \u201cactive\u201d shortly before filing suit.  Thus, Defendant argued that Plaintiff had no concrete interest in obtaining a judgeship and therefore lacked standing to bring his complaint.   \nThe district court granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion for sum mary judgment and denied \nDefendant\u2019s.  Adams v. Carney , C.A. No. 17- 181-MPT, 2018 WL 2411219 (D. Del. May 23, \n2018), clarifying Adams v. Carney , C.A.  No. 17- 181-MPT, 2017 WL 6033650 (D. Del. Dec. 6, \n2017).  The district court found that Adams had constitut ional standing to challenge the major \npolitical party provision despite never having applied because Plaintiff\u2019s application would have been futile in light of his political (un)affiliation.  See id.  at *4.  The district court credited Adams\u2019s \nassertion th at he would apply for a judgeship on the Delaware Superior or Supreme Court should \nhe be permitted to do so without first having to affiliate with a political party, and therefore found his injury to be concrete.  See id.   Although the district court did not find that Plaintiff had \nconstitutional standing to challenge the \u201cbare majority\u201d requirement, it found that Adams had \u201cprudential standing to challenge, on First Amendment grounds, the entirety of Article IV, \u00a7 3 of the Constitution of the State of Dela ware.\u201d  Id.  at *6.  The district court then held that \u00a7 3 violated \nthe First Amendment.  Id. at *8.  Defendant appealed ( C.A. No. 17 -181-MPT, D.I. 50) and moved \nto stay the summary judgment order ( C.A. No. 17 -181-MPT, D.I. 63), which the district court did.  \n(C.A. No. 17- 181-MPT, D.I. 69).   4 The Third Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s order in part.  Adams v. Governor of Del., \n922 F.3d 166 (3d Cir. 2019).3  The panel agreed that Adams had standing to challenge the major \npolitical party provision but not the bare majority requirement.  Id. at 174 \u201375.  The panel found \nthat the district court erred by hearing a challenge to the entirety of \u00a7 3 despite finding that Adams \nlacked standing to challenge the bare majority requirement.  Id.  at 175.  Consequently, the Third \nCircuit reversed the part of the summary judgment order that pertained to the Family Court and \nCourt of Common Pleas.  Id.  Upon reaching the merits of Adams\u2019s challenge to the major political \nparty requirement, the Third Circuit determined \u00a7 3 to be unconstitutional and inseverable from \nthe bare majority provision.  Id.  at 176- 84.  Defendant petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which the \nSupreme Court granted.4  \nThe Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Third Circuit on standing grounds and \nvacated the underlying judgment.  Carney v. Adams , 141 S. Ct. 493 (2020).  The Supreme Court \ndetermined that Adams had not demonstrated that he suffered from an injury- in-fact because he \nhad not shown that he was \u201cable and ready to apply for a judgeship in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d  Id.  at 501.  The Supreme Court rested its holding on three considerations.  First, the \nSupreme Court noted that Adams\u2019s stated intent to apply if permitted to do so was not corroborated \nby evidence , as the record was devoid of evidence of any past injury, prior applications or other \nindication that Adams was prepared to apply for a judgeship in the future.  Id.   Second, the Court \n \n3   The Third Circuit first published a ruling on Defendant\u2019s appeal on Feb ruary  5, 2019.  \n914 F.3d 827 (3d Cir. 2019).  On April 10, 2019, the Third Circuit vacated that ruling and \ngranted a reheari ng.  920 F.3d 878 (3d Cir. 2019).  That same day, the Third Circuit \npublished the cited ruling.  \n \n4  In granting the petition, the Supreme Court \u201casked that the parties first address the question whether Adams has demonstrated Article III standing to bring this lawsuit.\u201d  Carney  v. \nAdams , 141 S. Ct. 493, 498 (2020).  5 noted that  the context suggested \u201can abstract, generalized grievance, not an actual desire to become \na judge\u201d because Adams admitted to having read a law review article challenging the \nconstitutionality of the major political party provision and then calling the art icle\u2019s author and \ntelling him that he  would \u201clike to pursue\u201d the question by filing suit.  The Supreme Court noted \nthat shortly thereafter, Adams switched his party affiliation to \u201cunaffiliated\u201d and his bar membership status from \u201cemeritus\u201d to \u201cactive,\u201d bo th of which were necessary for Adams to bring \nhis challenge.  Id. at 500 -01.  Third, the Supreme Court reasoned that finding that Adams had \nstanding \u201cwould significantly weaken the longstanding legal doctrine preventing this Court from providing advisory opinions at the request of one who, without other concrete injury, believes that the government is not following the law.\u201d  Id.  at 501.  Finding that the evidence failed to \ndemonstrate that Adams was \u201cable and ready\u201d to apply for a judgeship, the Supreme Court held \nthat Adams had no standing to pursue the claim and did not proceed to the merits of his challenge.  \nC. The Present Dispute  \nPlaintiff filed the present lawsuit (D.I 1) on the day the Supreme Court issued its opinion.  \nHe has since filed an amended comp laint and a supplemental complaint.  (D.I. 15, 32).  As in \nAdams I , Plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit asserts that Delaware\u2019s method of nominating judges violates his \nconstitutional rights.  Specifically, he contends that the major political party provision violates his  \nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying hi m the ability to obtain a judgeship because \nof his political (un) affiliation.  (D.I. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 21- 31).   \nPlaintiff\u2019s Amended Complaint details Adams\u2019s preparation and readiness to apply for a \njudgeship.  Firs t, Adams alleges  that he contacted the State of Delaware Office of Pensions to \ninquire about how his pension would be impacted by being appointed to a judgeship.  (D.I. 15 \u00b6  6).  \nSecond, Adams alleges  that he developed a plan in his search for a judgeship that involves  focusing \non positions for which he will be \u201crealistically considered.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 14).  As such, he assert ed that 6 it is his intention to apply only for Superior Court and Court of Common Pleas vacancies in New \nCastle County where a sit ting judge is not seeking reappointment.  ( Id.).  Finally, Adams allege s \nthat he applied for a Superior Court position in 2017 and Court of Common Pleas positions in \n2018, 2020, and 2021.  ( Id. at 6 n.1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18).  Adams\u2019s 2017, 2018, and 2020 applications were \nrejected, and at the time he filed his Amended Complaint, he had not received a  response to his \n2021 application.  ( Id.).    \nDefendant moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff lacked \nstanding.  (D.I. 19).  The Court held a hearing on the motion (D.I. 27), and during the hearing \nPlaintiff requested leave to file a supplemental complaint to demonstrate that he has applied to an additional judgeship since commencing his lawsuit.  ( Id. at 17:8\u201318).  The Court permitted Adams \nto file a supplemental complaint.  (D.I. 31).  \nShortly thereafter, Plaintiff filed his Supplemental Complaint.\n5  (D.I. 32).  The \nSupplemental Complaint maintains the allegations of the Amended Complaint and adds two factual allegations.  First, it alleges that Adams had been rejected from the Court of Common Pleas position that he applied for in 2021.  ( Id. \u00b6 18).  Second, it discloses that Adams applied to a  \nvacancy  in the Superior Court , and had also been rejected from that position.  (Id. \u00b6 19).  \nDefendant moved to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Complaint for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction.  (D.I. 34).  De fendant maintains his position that Plaintiff lacks standing.  Defendant \nfurther asserts that Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from establishing standing, that Defendant is \n \n5  Plaintiff titled the Complaint a \u201cSecond Amended Complaint.\u201d  Because it alleges facts \nthat occur red after the commencement of this action, however, the Court refers to it as a \nsupplemental complaint.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) (\u201c On motion and reasonable notice, the \ncourt may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any \ntransaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.\u201d).  7 not genuinely injured, and that his alleged injury is not redressable.  ( See D.I. 35, 38).6  Plaintiff \nsubmitted a brief opposing Defendant\u2019s motion that asserts Plaintiff has a genuine interest in \nbecoming a judge as evidenced by the many applications he has submitted to Delaware\u2019s state courts.  (D.I. 37).   \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA motion to dismiss a complaint for lack of standing is properly brought as a motion to \ndismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Ballentine v. United States , 486 F.3d 806, 810 (3d Cir . 2007).  A party moving \nunder Rule 12(b)(1) may either bring a facial challenge, asserting that the facts as alleged in the complaint do not establish standing, or a factual challenge, disputing the complaint\u2019s jurisdictional facts.  See Gould Elecs. Inc. v. United States , 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000).   \nDefendant\u2019s motion brings a factual challenge to Plaintiff\u2019s standing.\n7  \u201cBecause at issue \nin a factual 12(b)(1) motion is the trial court \u2019s jurisdiction  \u2013 its very power to hear the case \u2013 . . . \nthe tria l court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear \nthe case.\u201d  Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977).  Courts \n \n6  In his opening brief, Defendant sought leave to take discovery on the question of standing.  \n(D.I. 35 at 3).  The Court granted Defendant\u2019s request to take limited discovery on  standing.  \n(D.I. 40).  The parties , however, ultimately declined to take any discovery.  (D.I. 41).  \n \n7  Defendant stated that he \u201cmoves to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) on facial grounds and, if needed, on factual grounds.\u201d  (D.I. 35 at 1).  Defendant, however, submitted a signed declaration controverting Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he is genuinely interested in obtaining a judgeship.  (D.I. 36).  Indeed, the thrust of Defendant\u2019s motion is that Plaintiff is not sincerely interested in becoming a judge and that the steps he has taken (developing a plan, submitting applications) are merely attempts to manufacture standing.  Because Defendant is attacking the factual allegations underlying Plaintiff\u2019s complaint rather than taking them as true and arguing tha t those facts do  not establish Plaintiff\u2019s standing, \nDefendant\u2019s motion is understood as bringing a factual challenge.  8 considering a factual challenge will not presume that the pla intiff\u2019s allegations are truthful, and the \nplaintiff bears the burden of proving that the court has jurisdiction to hear his complaint.  See id.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and possess only the power authorized by \nthe Unite d States Constitution and federal statutes.  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of \nAmerica , 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).  Article III of the Constitution extends the judicial power to \nan enumerated set of \u201cC ases\u201d and \u201cC ontroversies.\u201d  U.S.  CONST . art. III, \u00a7 2.  By defining the \npower of the federal courts, Article III situates the federal courts within the \u201c\u2018tripartite allocation \nof power\u2019 set forth in the Constitution.\u201d  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 341 (2006) (quoting Valley Forge Christian C ollege v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, \nInc., 454 U.S. 464, 474 (1982)).  Indeed, it has been remarked that \u201c[n]o principle is more \nfundamental to the judiciary\u2019s proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal- court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.\u201d  Raines v. Byrd , 521 U.S. \n811, 818 (1997).   \nThe standing doc trine operates to ensure that federal courts do not exceed the bounds of \ntheir authority.  See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016).  \u201c The law of Article III \nstanding, which is built on separation- of-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process \nfrom being used to usurp the powers of the political branches.\u201d  Clapper v. Amnesty Int \u2019l USA , \n568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013) .  To have standing, plaintiffs must establish three things:   \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d  \u2013 an \ninvasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized, and (b) \u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019\u201d  Second, there must be a causal connection between \nthe injury and the conduct complained of  \u2013 the injury has to be \n\u201cfairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and \nnot . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party \nnot before the court.\u201d  Third, it must be \u201clikely,\u201d as opposed to 9 merely \u201cspeculative,\u201d that the i njury will be \u201credressed by a \nfavorable decision.\u201d    \n \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) .  The main dispute between the parties here is \nwhether Adams has suffered an injury in fact  (D.I. 35 at 12- 19), although Defendant offers a short \nargument that Adams injury is not redressable  (D.I. 35 at 20).  Before tackling those disputes, \nhowever, the Court will address Defendant\u2019s contention that collateral estoppel precludes Plaintiff \nfrom establishing standing as well as  the parties \u2019 dispute about what is properly in the factual \nrecord.   \nA. Collateral  Estoppe l \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff is collateral ly estoppe d from establishing standing in this \ncase because the Supreme Court determined that based on the facts alleged in Adam s I Plaintiff \ndid not have standing.  \u201cThe doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents the relitigation of issues that \nhave been decided in a previous action.\u201d  Hawksbill Sea Turtle v. Fed. Emer . Mgmt. Agency , \n126 F.3d 461, 474 (3d Cir. 1997).  To apply collateral estoppel, f our elements  must be present: \n\u201c(1) the previous determination was necessary to the decision; (2) the identical issue was \npreviously litigated; (3) the issue was actually decided in a decision that was final, valid, and on the merits; and (4) the  party being precluded from relitigating the issue was adequately represented \nin the previous action.\u201d  Id. at  475.   \nCollateral estoppel promotes judicial economy and finality by precluding a party from \nrehashing old issues.  Accordingly, \u201c [i]t is well se ttled that changed factual circumstances can \noperate to preclude the application of collateral estoppel.\u201d  Scooper Dooper, Inc. v. Kraftco Corp. , \n494 F.2d 840, 846 (3d Cir. 1974) ; see also Raytech Corp. v. White , 54 F.3d 187, 190 (3d Cir. 1995) \n(citing Montana v. United States , 440 U.S. 147 (1979) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has also recognized \n[] that collateral estoppel is inappropriate if facts essential to the earlier litigated issue have 10 changed.\u201d)).  This is so because when material facts are altered, a party  cannot submit an identical \nissue.  See EEOC v. American Airlines , 48 F.3d 164, 168 (5th Cir.1995)  (\u201cTo produce absolution \nfrom collateral estoppel on the ground of changed factual circumstances, the changes must be of a \ncharacter and degree as might place before the court an issue different in some respect from the one decided in the initial case.\u201d ); see also Scooper Dooper , 494 F.2d at 896 (explaining that \u201cwhere \nthe changed circumstances are not material, and therefore do not amount to controlling f acts, \ncollateral estoppel remains applicable.\u201d ) \nIn Hawksbill , plaintiffs filed a second suit to enjoin the construction of a temporary housing \nproject in the U.S. Virgin Islands under the Endangered Species Act.  In Plaintiffs\u2019 first suit, their motion to enjoin was denied by Judge Finch, who reasoned that the project\u2019s mitigation efforts \nwere adequate because there was no evidence that Tree Boas inhabited the project site.  In the second action, plaintiffs presented new and robust evidence that Tree Boas did in fact occupy the \narea in and around the project site.  Id. at 469.  Despite these changed facts, Judge Brotman, the \njudge in the second action, treated Judge Finch\u2019s findings as conclusive and denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for preliminary injunctive reli ef.  The Third Circuit  reversed, holding that Judge Brotman \nerred in treating Judge Finch\u2019s findings as conclusive because \u201cwhen significant new facts grow out of a continuing course of conduct , the issues in a successive suit may fail to constitute the same \n\u2018issue\u2019 so as to merit preclusive effect.\u201d  Id. at 477.  In other words, the new evidence \ndemonstrating that the Tree Boa was present at the project site substantially altered the question about whether defendants\u2019 mitigation efforts were sufficient, and, as a result , it was inappropriate \nfor Judge Brotman to give Judge Finch\u2019s findings preclusive effect.  \nSimilarly, the Court will not apply collateral estoppel here because new facts render the \nissue of standing fundamentally different than the issue the Supreme Court decided in the parties\u2019 11 previous dispute.  In Adams I , the Supreme Court, commenting that \u201c[t]his is a highly fact -specific \ncase,\u201d determined that Adams was not \u201cable and ready\u201d to apply after noting that, among other \nthings, Adams had not appli ed to and was not prepared to apply for a judgeship.  Carney , 141 S. \nCt. at 501.  The same cannot be said  now, where the record evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff \nhas applied to multiple judgeships and has developed a plan to apply to future judgeships.  \nAccordingly, the  Court\u2019s inquiry requires analysis of material facts that were missing from Adams  \nI, and the  parties will not be relitigating the identical issue previously decided. \nB. The Scope of the Factual Record  \nThe Supplemental Complaint asserts that i n March of 2021, after his initial complaint was \nfiled in this case,  Adams applied to a Superior Court vacancy.  ( See D.I. 32 \u00b6 19).  Defendant \ncontends that standing is determined at the time P laintiff file d his original complaint , and the Court \nmay not consider Adam\u2019s later application in its standing analysis.  (D.I. 35 at 7- 10).  In addition, \nPlaintiff\u2019s Amended Complaint and his Supplemental Complaint allege that he did not apply to certain vacant judgeships in 2018 and 2019 be cause he was busy with real estate projects.  (D.I.  15 \n\u00b6 15, D.I. 32 \u00b6 15).  Defendant contends that this assertion is inconsistent with representations that \nPlaintiff made in Adams I , and that Plaintiff should be judicially estopped from making it  now.  \n(D.I. 35 at 16- 18).  The Court will address these arguments in turn. \n1. Consideration of the Supplemental Complaint\u2019s New Assertions  \nPlaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Complaint asserts that he has applied to five judgeships.  \nPlaintiff\u2019s Amended Complaint included four  of these applications: to the Superior Court in 2017 \n(D.I. 15 at 6 n.1) and to the Court of Common Pleas in 2018, 2020, and 2021.  ( Id. at 6 n.1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, \n18).  Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Complaint further asserts that he applied to a vacancy on the \nSuperior Court  in March of 2021.  (D.I. 32 \u00b6 19).  Defendant argues that the standing inquiry 12 focus es on Plaintiff\u2019s standing at the time he filed suit (i.e. December of 2020)  and, thus, the Court \nmust disregard the later application for its standing analysis.  \nRule 15(d) of the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure  gives license to \u201cpermit \nsupplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense.\u201d  The \nweight of authority holds that Rule 15(d) permits new allegations in a supplemental complaint to cure standing defects.\n8  Indeed, a  plurality of circuit courts permit supplemental pleadings to cure \nstanding defects, while a minority of circuit courts do not.9  Although the Third Circuit has yet to \naddress  the question squarely , there is some suggestion that it will join the plurality of courts of \nappeals.  In Korb v. Hastings , a unanimous Third Circuit panel stated in a footnote that \u201c[a] \nsupplemental pleading may cure jurisdictional defects.\u201d  860 Fed. App\u2019 x 222, 226 n.5 (3d Cir. \n2021) (citing Mathews v. Diaz , 426 U.S. 67, 75 (1976)).  So too, i n T-Mobile Northeast LLC v. \nCity of Wilmington, Del. , the Third Circuit permitted a plaintiff\u2019s supplemental complaint to relate \nback and cure the initial complaint\u2019s  ripeness defect .10  913 F.3d 311, 318 (3d Cir. 2019).  Just \n \n8  By considering the question of whether a supplemental pleading may cure a standing \ndefect, the Court does not mean to suggest that the  initial or amended complaints in this \ncase are defective.  Rather, the Court is simply considering whether it may consider facts that arose after the initial complaint in its standing analysis.  \n \n9  The First, Second, Fourth, Ninth, D.C. and Federal Circui ts permit supplemental pleadings \nto cure standing defects.  See Scahill v. District of Columbia , 909 F.3d 1177 (D.C. Cir. \n2018); Northstar Fin. Advisors Inc. v. Schwab Invs., 779 F.3d 1036, 1044 (9th Cir. 2015); United States ex rel. Gadbois v. PharMerica Corp., 809 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2015); Daniels v. Arcade, L.P., 477 F. App\u2019x 125, 131 (4th Cir. 2012); Prasco, LLC v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., 537 F.3d 1329, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Travelers Ins. Co. v. 633 Third Assocs., 973 F.2d 82, 88 (2d Cir. 1992).  The Seventh, Eighth and Tenth Circuits do not.  See S. Utah \nWilderness All. v. Palma , 707 F.3d 1143, 1153 (10th Cir. 2013); Pollack v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, 577 F.3d 736, 742 n.2 (7th Cir. 2009); Park v. Forest Serv. , 205 F.3d 1034, 1037\u2013\n38 (8th Cir. 2000). \n \n10  The ripeness defect  in T-Mobile Northeast LLC was non- jurisdictional, see id. at 323\u201326, \nand the Court stated that it was not reaching the issue of whether a supplemental pleading \ncould cure a pleading over which the Court lacked jurisdiction.  Id . at 323 n.15.  13 nine months later, in Garrett v. Wexford Health , the Third Circuit followed T-Mobile and permitted \na prisoner  to supplement his complaint to cure an exhaustion defect.  938 F.3d 69 (3d Cir. 2019) .  \nIn Garrett , the panel quoted Mathews v. Diaz , 426 U.S. 67, 75 (1976), for the proposition that a \nplaintiff who satisfies a nonwaivable condition of jurisdiction after filing suit may file a \nsupplemental complaint in the district court to eliminate the jurisdictional problem .  Garrett , \n938 F.3d at 83.  At least one other district court in the Third Circuit has expressed that \u201csupplementation may allow a plaintiff to add newly arisen facts that, e.g. , cure jurisdictional \ndefects.\u201d  Przywieczerski v. Blinken, No. 20- 02098, 2021 WL 2385822 at *2 (D.N.J. June 10, \n2021).\n11   \nThe Court agrees with the weight of authority.  Permitting a supplemental pleading to cure \na jurisdictional defect serves to ensur e that federal courts fulfill their constitutionally assigned \nfunction to decid e cases and controversies.  See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016); \nScalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers , 17 S UFFOLK  \nU. L. REV. 881, 882 (1983) .12  Accordingly, the Court will determine whether Plaintiff has standing \nby considering all of his applications, including the March 2021 application for the Superior Court.  \n2. Consideration of Plaintiff\u2019s Allegation that He Did No t Apply to \nCertain Vacancies Because He Was Busy With His Real Estate Business  \nThe parties dispute whether the Court should consider Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he did not \napply to two Superior Court judgeships that opened in New Castle County in 2019 beca use \u201c[t]he \ntiming . . . was bad for Adams\u201d because of his involvement in real estate ventures.  (D.I. 35 at 15).  \n \n11  Wright & Miller  also supports that jurisdictional defects may be cured by a supplemental \npleading.  See 6A Wright & Miller, Fed eral Prac tice and Procedure  \u00a7 1507 (3d ed.) \n(explaining that \u201ca lack of subject -matter jurisdiction should be  treated like any other defect \nfor purposes of defining the proper scope of supplemental pleading.\u201d).   \n \n12  Similarly, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653 states that \u201c[d]efective allegations of jurisdiction may be \namended, upon terms, in the trial or appellate courts.\u201d   14 Defendant argues that Plaintiff is judicially estopped from offering this explanation because, in the \nparties\u2019 previous litigation, Plaintiff represented that he \u201chas not sought other opportunities to \nfocus on a judgeship\u201d and \u201cwould apply for any judicial position for which he feels qualifie[d].\u201d  (D.I. 35 at 17 -18 (citing Plaintiff\u2019s statements in various briefs)) .  Plaintiff responds that Def endant \nhas not established that judicial estoppel applies because Defendant has not shown that the \npositions he has taken are irreconcilably inconsistent, adopted in bad faith or that judicial estoppel is necessary to preserve the court\u2019s integrity.  (D.I. 37 at 14\u201316).  \nJudicial estoppel is a fact -specific, equitable remedy.  In re Kane , 628 F.3d 631, 637 \n(3d Cir. 2010).  Judicial estoppel may be imposed only if:  \n(1) the party to be estopped is asserting a position that is \nirreconcilably inconsistent with one he or she asserted in a prior \nproceeding; (2) the party changed his or her position in bad faith, i.e., in a culpable manner threatening to the court \u2019s authority or \nintegrity; and (3) the use of judicial estoppel is tailored to addres s \nthe affront to the court \u2019s authority or integrity. \n \nMontrose Med. Grp. Participating Sav. Plan v. Bulger , 243 F.3d 773, 777- 78 (3d Cir. 2001).  The \ndoctrine is to be invoked sparingly, as it is not intended to eliminate all inconsistencies, but instead \nis \u201cappropriate when the inconsistent positions are tantamount to a knowing misrepresentation to \nor even a fraud on the court.\u201d  Krystal Cadillac -Oldsmobile GMC Truck, Inc. v. General Motors \nCorp., 337 F.3d 314, 319, 324 (3d Cir. 2003). \nHere, the prerequisi tes for judicial estoppel have not been met.  First, it is not clear that the \npositions that Adams ha s taken are irreconcilably inconsistent.  Defendant makes much of \nPlaintiff\u2019s statement \u201cthat he has not sought other opportunities to focus on a judgeship.\u201d  Plaintiff\u2019s statement, made in a deposition ( C.A. No. 17- 181-MPT, D.I. 30 at 4:13\u20136:18), however, \nis not irreconcilably inconsistent with his assertion that he later became busy with real estate.  \nMoreover, as Defendant recognizes , Plaintiff\u2019s statemen t seems to refer to legal opportunities.  15 (See D.I. 35 at 17 -18) (acknowledging that \u201cPlaintiff affirmatively represented he had not sought \nother legal employment  . . .\u201d) (emphasis added).  At his deposition, Plaintiff explained that he had \nchanged his bar  status from \u201cemeritus\u201d to \u201cactive\u201d and was focus ed on obtaining a judgeship.  \n(C.A. No. 17- 181-MPT, D.I. 30 at 4:13\u20136:18).  Nowhere in that deposition or elsewhere did \nPlaintiff represent that he would focus on a judgeship and not pursue any other way of making \nmoney.  Accordingly, the Court cannot find that Plaintiff took an irreconcilably inconsistent \nposition, let alone one that is indicative of culpable conduct vis -\u00e0-vis the court.  See Montrose \nMed. Grp. Participating Sav. Plan, 243 F.3d at 781 (expla ining that a litigant acts in \u201cbad faith\u201d \nfor judicial estoppel purposes only if he behaves  in a matter that is somehow culpable vis -\u00e0-vis the \ncourt).  Therefore, the Court will consider Plaintiff\u2019s assertion \u2013  which Defendant chose not to test \nin discovery (D.I. 41) \u2013 that he did not apply to certain judgeships in 2019 because of his business \nventure s. \nC. The Record Demonstrates that Plaintiff Has Standing  \nDefendant offers two arguments that Plaintiff lacks standing.   First, he argues that Plaintiff \nhas suffered no genuine injury.  Second, Defendant insists that, even if Plaintiff has suffered an injury, it is not one that is redressable.  The Court addresses each argument in turn. \n1. Plaintiff Has Shown He Is Injured by the Major Political Party  \nProvision           \nDefendant contends that Plaintiff is not injured by the major political party provision \nbecause he lacks any genuine interest in being a judge.  Defendant insists rather that Plaintiff is feigning his interest and applying to positions only to manufacture standing so that he can bring this case.  (D.I. 35 at 9- 16).  Defendant believes that th e Supreme Court\u2019s factual determinations \nin Adams I are binding and \u201ccreate the context in which standing in this action should be 16 addressed.\u201d  (D.I. 35 at 14).  Viewing the record through the proper prism, Defendant insists that \nthe major political party provision causes Plaintiff no genuine injury. \nDefendant argues that the factual findings made in Adams I are binding upon the parties in \nthis subsequent litigation between the same parties.  Defendant then excerpts certain facts found \nby the Supreme Court:  \nFirst, the record showed that, between 2012 and 2016, during which \ntime Adams was a practicing lawyer and a registered Democrat, Delaware\u2019 s five courts had a combined total of 14 openings for \nwhich Adams, then a Democrat, would have been eligible.  Yet he  \ndid not apply for any of them . . .  Second, on December 31, 2015, after roughly 12 years as a lawyer for the Delaware Department of Justice, Adams retired.  In February \n2016, Adams changed his bar membership from \u201cActive\u201d to \u201cEmeritus\u201d status.  He then r eturned to \u201cActive\u201d status in January \n2017.  In his deposition, he stated that at about that same time in the \n\u201c[b]eginning of the year, January/February,\u201d he read a law review article arguing that Delaware \u2019s judicial eligibility requirements were \nunconstit utional because they excluded independents  . . .   \n Third, shortly thereafter, on February 13, 2017, Adams changed his \npolitical affiliation from Democrat to unaffiliated independent. Before that, he had been a Democrat his \u201cwhole life\u201d and actively involved in the Delaware Democratic Party.  Leaving the pa rty made \nit less likely that he would become a judge.  But doing so made it \npossible for him to vindicate his view of the law as set forth in the article.  \n Fourth, after Adams became a political independent on February 13, 2017, he filed this lawsuit eight days later on February 21.  \n Fifth, Adams said in his answer to interrogatories that he \u201chas no knowledge of what judicial positions may become open in the next year.\u201d  \n Sixth, other than the act of filing the lawsuit itself, the summary judgment record contains no evidence of conversations or other actions taken by Adams suggesting that he was \u201cable and ready\u201d to apply for a judgeship.  \n 17 (D.I. 35 at 14 -15 (quoting Carney v. Adams , 141 S. Ct. at 500\u201301 (2018) )).  Defendant argues that \nthe Supreme Court\u2019s findings and later conclusion that Adams had an \u201cabstract, generalized \ngrievance\u201d should \u201ccreate the context in which this action should be addressed.\u201d  (D.I. 35 at 14-15).  Defendant submits that this is so because \u201cnothing has changed\u201d since the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Adams I.   (Id. at 15).  \nIn this Court\u2019s view, Defendant stretch es the Supreme Court\u2019s findings in Adams I too far.  \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion reflected the record before it and did not, as Defendant seems to suggest, indelibly taint Plaintiff as a man who can never have a genuine interest in obtaining a \njudgeship.  The record in Adams I  indicated that Adams had nothing more than an abstract, \ngeneralized grievance.  But the record before this Court is different, and it  demonstrates that \nAdams\u2019s interest in a judgeship has matured into something concrete and genuine.   \nBetween 2017 and 2021, Plaintiff has applied to five judgeships, and there is no evidence \nthat he does not intend to continue applying for judgeships in t he future.  Plaintiff\u2019s Amended \nComplaint details four applications and since this litigation has beg un, Plaintiff applied for an \nadditional judgeship.  Although judgeships are limited, and vacancies do not arise in a predictable manner, the record therefo re suggests that when a vacancy that fits Plaintiff\u2019s plan arises , Plaintiff \nwill apply for that position.   \nBecause Plaintiff is seeking prospective relief, he must show that he is \u201clikely to suffer \nfuture injury\u201d from Defendant\u2019s conduct to establish sta nding.  See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons , \n461 U.S. 95, 103 (1983); McNair v. Synapse Group Inc., 672 F.3d 213 (3d Cir. 2012).  To show that he is \u201clikely to suffer injury\u201d from the major political party provision, Plaintiff must show that \nhe is \u201cable and r eady\u201d to apply for a judgeship to which the provision applies in the future.  \nSee Carney v. Adams , 141 S.Ct. 493, 500 (2020).  In the Court\u2019s view, Plaintiff\u2019s applications to 18 judgeships demonstrates that Plaintiff is \u201cable and ready\u201d to apply for vacant j udgeships that fit \nhis plan should such an opportunity arise.   \nDefendant appears to recognize that Plaintiff has shown that he is \u201cable and ready\u201d to apply \nbut urges the Court to dismiss this evidence as being an attempt to manufacture standing.  In other  \nwords, Defendant accuse s Plaintiff of applying only in an effort to dress up his generalized, \nabstract grievance with Delaware\u2019s scheme for staffing judges.  (D.I. 35 at 18- 19).  Defendant \ninsists that Plaintiff is merely a \u201ctester\u201d who wants only to be a  plaintiff in a lawsuit, not a judge.   \n(D.I. 35 at 19).  Yet all that Defendant submit s as evidence for this proposition is that Plaintiff did \nnot apply for  four judicial vacancies .  Two of those vacancies we re for judgeships in Sussex \nCounty \u2013 and inconsi stent with Plaintiff\u2019s professed \u201cplan\u201d \u2013 and the other two vacancies occurred \nin 2019, a time when Plaintiff avers he was tied up with his small business.  ( See D.I. 32 \u00b6 15).  \nThe Court cannot conclude on this alone that Plaintiff\u2019s repeated applications  for open judicial \nvacancies are insincere.  \nUltimately, the record before the Court suggests that Plaintiff\u2019s interest in becoming a \njudge has developed  into something tangible and sincere.  As a politically unaffiliated voter \ninterested in becoming a judge, Plaintiff is barred from certain judgeships by virtue of the major \npolitical party provision and he is, therefore, injured by that provision. \n2. Plaintiff\u2019s Injury Is Redressable  \nDefendant argues that even if Plaintiff were injured by the major political party provision, \nthat injury is not redressable because there is no realistic possibility that he would ever be selected for a judgeship.  (D.I. 35 at 20).  Defendant argues that the fact that Plaintiff \u2019s applications have \nbeen repeatedly rejected after consider ation on the merits and his time away from practicing law \nshow  that it is not realistic that he will ever be selected for a judgeship.  Asserting that there is no 19 realistic possibility that Plaintiff will be nominated, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff lacks standing \nto challenge the major political party provision.   \nPlaintiff, of course, disagrees.  Plaintiff points out that he satisfies the formal prerequisites \nfor being a judge in Delaware, as Article IV, \u00a7 2 of the Delaware Constitution requires only that \nstate judges \u201cbe citizens of the State and learned in the law ,\u201d and there is no dispute that Plaintiff \nis a citizen of Delaware who is an active member of the Delaware Bar.  (D.I. 37 at 18 -19).  Given \nthis, Plaintiff challenges Defendant\u2019s assertion that Adams has no realistic possibility of obtaining a judgment as either \u201c(1) a disturbing admission that the Judicial Nominating Commission and/or Gov. Carney have pre -determined . . . that his application will never be considered, or (2) nothing \nbut rank speculation.\u201d  Id.  More fundamentally, Plaintiff suggests that the injury to be redressed is not that he is not being selected for judgeships, but  instead that his applications to certain \npositions are not being considered solely on the grounds that he is politically unaffiliated.  \n\u201cFor an injury to be redressable, the plaintiff must show that it is \u2018likely, as opposed to \nmerely speculative, that th e injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Shalom Pentecostal \nChurch v. Acting Sec\u2019y U.S. Dep \u2019t of Homeland Sec., 783 F.3d 156, 161- 62 (3d Cir. 2015).  \nHowever, \u201c [w]hen the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of  one \ngroup to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.  The \u2018injury i n fact \u2019 in an equal protection case of this variety \nis the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. \u201d  Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of \nJackson ville, Fla. , 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993).  This principle accords with Regents of the University \nof California v. Bakke , which involved a challenge to a school\u2019s admissions plan that reserved a 20 specific number of seats for minority applicants.  438 U.S. 265 ( 1978).  In Bakke, the Court \ndismissed the notion that the Plaintiff lacked standing because he did not show that he  would be \nadmitted even if he were able to compete for every seat, because the plaintiff\u2019s injury was that he \ncould not  compete for  every seat.  See id. at 278 n.14.  Here, Plaintiff alleges that he is injured \nbecause he cannot compete for judgeships solely because he is politically unaffiliated.  Like the \nasserted injuries in Ba kke and Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am., Plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury can be redressed by a favorable court decision whether or not Plaintiff ultimately obtains a judgeship.  The injury is that he is excluded from being considered for a judges hip and that \nexclusion from consideration is remediable.\n13   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing to challenge the major \npolitical party provision and, therefore, denies Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.  An appropriat e \norder will follow.  \n \n13  Even assuming that Plaintiff must show that he has a realistic possibility of being \nnominated to have standing, the Co urt cannot conclude that Defendant has no realistic \npossibility of being nominated.  Plaintiff meets the formal qualifications for being \nnominated to a judgeship: he is a citizen of Delaware who is a member of the Delaware bar.  That he has previously had his applications denied does not foreclose eventual success.  Delaware judgeships are likely competitive and many qualified applicants will likely be passed over.  Similarly, that he has spent time away from the practice of law is not a clear death knell f or his chances .  There is no evidence before the Court that the state \nexclusively chooses applicants who are currently practicing law.  Nor do the job postings in the record mention a preference for candidates who are actively practicing law.  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nJAMES R.
