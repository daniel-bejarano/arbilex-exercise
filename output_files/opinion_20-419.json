INTRODUCTION\nPresently before the court in this asbestos-related personal injury action is a motion for\nsummary judgment filed by Defendant Crane Co. (D.I. 55)! For the reasons that follow, the\ncourt recommends GRANTING Crane Co.\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\nIl BACKGROUND\na. Procedural History\nPlaintiffs Rickey Thorne (\u201cThorne\u201d) and Barbara J. Thorne (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d)\ninitiated this action by filing a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of\nDelaware on March 25, 2020, on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. (DIL.\n1 at { 1) Plaintiffs allege that Thorne developed mesothelioma as a result of his exposure to\n\nasbestos-containing materials, including those provided by Crane Co., during his service in the\n\nUnited States Air Force. (dd. at J] 16, 25-61; D.I. 60, Ex. 1 at 57:3-58:12) Plaintiffs assert\n\n! The briefing for the present motion is as follows: Crane Co.\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 56),\nPlaintiffs\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 60), and Crane Co.\u2019s reply brief (D.I. 61).\nclaims for negligence, willful and wanton conduct, strict liability, conspiracy, concealment,\nmisrepresentation, loss of consortium, and punitive damages. (D.I. 1)\n\nThorne was deposed on July 13, 2020. (D.I. 60, Ex. 1) Plaintiffs did not produce any\nother product identification witnesses for deposition. On July 1, 2021, the court issued a\nmemorandum opinion establishing that Iowa substantive law shall apply to the claims and\ndefenses asserted by all parties in this action. (D.I. 52) On September 3, 2021, Crane Co. filed\nthe present motion for summary judgment. (D.I. 55)\n\nb. Facts\n\ni. Minot Air Force Base\n\nThorne served in the United States Air Force from June 1971 to June 1974. (DL. 1 at\n26(a); D.I. 60, Ex. 1 at 11:25-12:5, 38:17-19) After completing basic training in Texas, he was\nstationed at Minot Air Force Base (\u201cMinot\u201d) in North Dakota, where he received additional\ntraining as a heating specialist. (D.I. 60, Ex. 1 at 12:6-13:19) In that role, Thorne testified that\nhe maintained gas appliances, including stoves, hot water heaters, and furnaces, by performing\ntasks that included calibrating thermostats and maintaining pumps and pneumatic valves. (Jd. at\n14:6-15:16, 16:6-17:3) Thorne\u2019s product exposure relevant to the moving Defendant arises from\nhis work on valves. (Jd. at 26:10-14) The work that Thorne performed on valves was either\nremoval and replacement or repair by repacking leaking valves. (Jd. at 16:23-24:25, 139:12-18,\n143:25-144:22, 148:7-156:9)\n\nRemoving and replacing a valve required shutting down the system, removing external\ninsulation with a knife from the pipe and flanges leading to the valve, unbolting the valve,\ncleaning both ends of the flange with wire brushes and a die grinder and removing the old\n\ngaskets. (Id. at 16:23-21:11) The new flange gaskets were sometimes fashioned from sheet\nmetal using gasket cutters or a utility knife. (/d. at 25:13-26:9) Thorne believes the gasket and\npacking material was manufactured by Garlock. (Jd. at 23:20-24:25, 26:3-9)\n\nRepair of a leaking valve involved removal of the insulation from the pipelines and from\nany joints or unions. (Jd. at 22:1-6) Thorne used a pick to dig out the old packing and then used\nan air hose to blow out packing remnants. (/d. at 22:3-23:10) He described the packing as rope\nshaped. (/d.) Thorne identified Garlock as the manufacturer of the replacement rope packing\nwhich he believed contained asbestos. (/d. at 23:21-24:25) Thorne cut pieces of replacement\npacking, affixed them around the valve stem, put down the bonnet and pressed it down with a\npacking nut to force it to hold. (Jd. at 22:7-18) After repacking the valve, the pipe insulation\nwas replaced and covered with thin sheet metal. (Jd. at 25:4-26:2) The unions were covered\nwith a mixture of dry asbestos powder and water to form a paste that was applied and covered\nwith cheesecloth. (/d. at 150:9-155:1)\n\nThorne identified Crane Co. as one of four manufacturers of valves used at Minot. (/d. at\n26:10-27:24) He could not estimate what percentage of his time was spent working on valves.\n(Id. at 28:1-22) He could not say how frequently he made repairs to Crane Co. valves in the\nwinter months or in the warmer weather months when the system was shut down for general\nmaintenance. (/d.) He had no knowledge of the age of the Crane Co. valves, or the number of\ntimes they were repaired or maintained, if any, before he performed work on them. (Id. at\n165:15-166:17) He did not identify Crane Co. as the manufacturer, seller or supplier of pipe\ninsulation, rope packing, or gasket materials. (/d. at 23:20-24:25, 26:3-9)\n\nIn their answering brief, Plaintiffs state that \u201c[n]ew gaskets were occasionally purchased\n\nfrom the manufacturer.\u201d (D.I. 60 at 3) However, Plaintiffs\u2019 reference to Thorne\u2019s deposition\ntestimony is inaccurate, and the passage cited by Plaintiffs relates to pumps and has nothing to\ndo with Crane Co. valves.?\nii. John Deere\n\nShortly after being honorably discharged from the Air Force in June 1974, Thorne began\nworking for John Deere at a plant in Waterloo, Iowa. (/d. at 38:17-41:3, 134:20-22) Thorne\ntestified that John Deere had steam heating. (Jd. at 56:15-25) A crew maintained the boiler plant\nbut once the steam left the boiler plant, Thorne\u2019s responsibility was to maintain the control\nequipment, condensate pumps, steam traps and steam valves. (/d.) He explained his work on\nvalves was the same as he performed at Minot except that penetrating oil was used to remove\nrusty bolts so the old gaskets could also be removed. (Jd. at 57:3-58:5)\n\nCrane Co. included in its opening brief Thorne\u2019s work history at John Deere. (D.I. 56 at\n1-7) However, Plaintiffs do not address in their answering brief Thorne\u2019s alleged asbestos\nexposure anywhere other than at Minot. (D.I. 60) Therefore, for purposes of its\nrecommendations on the pending motion, the court confines Thorne\u2019s relevant exposure history\nto his work on Crane Co.\u2019s valves only at Minot from 1971 to 1974.\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\na. Summary Judgment\n\nWhen jurisdiction is based upon diversity, the District Court applies the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. See Schmigel v. Uchal, 800 F.3d 113, 119 (3d Cir. 2015). \u201cThe court shall\ngrant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material\n2 The passage is recited as follows:\n\nQ. \u201cWhere did you get the new gasket material that you used for the pump\u2019s housing\n\nFE tot of times, we bought them, you know, from the \u2014 you know, the manufacturer\n\nor whatever. We \u2014 sometimes \u2014 because there were smaller pumps and they\u2019re generally\nthe same kind, I guess, we would try to keep a stock.\u201d (D.I. 60, Ex. 1 at 33:8-15)\nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Material\nfacts are those that could affect the outcome of the proceeding, and \u201ca dispute about a material\nfact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the\nnon-moving party.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Anderson v.\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23\n(1986)).\n\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely disputed\nmaterial fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to\ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial, and the court must view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 587;\nWilliams, 891 F.2d at 460-61; Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). An assertion of\nwhether or not a fact is genuinely disputed must be supported either by citing to \u201cparticular parts\nof materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information,\naffidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only),\nadmissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials,\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do\nnot establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot\nproduce admissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B).\n\nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must \u201cdo more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586. The \u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not\ndefeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;\u201d rather, there must be\nenough evidence to enable a jury to reasonably find for the non-moving party on the issue.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 247-49 (emphasis omitted). \u201cIf the evidence is merely colorable, or is not\nsignificantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d Jd. at 249-50 (internal citations\nomitted); see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. If the non-movant fails to make a sufficient showing\non an essential element of their case on which they bear the burden of proof, then the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.\n\nThe court has determined that Iowa substantive law applies to the claims and defenses\nasserted by all parties in this action. (D.I. 52)\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\na. Iowa\u2019s Statue of Repose\n\nThorne\u2019s cause of action is not time-barred under Iowa\u2019s statute of limitations regarding\npersonal injuries caused by an asbestos-containing product, lowa Code \u00a7 614.1(2A),\u00b0 unless\nIowa\u2019s statute of repose, Iowa Code \u00a7 614.1(11), bars Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n\nIowa\u2019s statute of repose provides:\n\n...an action arising out of the unsafe or defective condition of an\nimprovement to real property based on tort...and founded on...injury to the\nperson or wrongful death, shall not be brought more than fifteen years after\nthe date on which occurred the act or omission of the defendant alleged in\nthe action to have been the cause of the injury or death.\n\nIowa Code \u00a7 614.1(11).4\n\n3 Towa Code \u00a7 614.1(2A) provides that a personal injury action brought against the manufacturer\nof an alleged defective product \u201cshall not be commenced more than fifteen years after the\nproduct was first...installed for use.\u201d But, subsection (2A)(b)(1) provides the exception that the\nfifteen-year limitation \u201cshall not apply to the time period in which to discover a disease that is\nlatent and caused by exposure to a harmful material, in which event the cause of action shall be\ndeemed to have accrued when the disease and such disease\u2019s cause have been made known to the\nperson or at the point the person should have been aware of the disease and such disease\u2019s\ncause.\u201d However, \u201c[t]his subsection shall not apply to cases governed by subsection 11 of this\nsection,\u201d meaning that a claim may still be barred by the statute of repose if it is not barred by\nthe statute of limitations.\n\n4 The statute of repose was subsequently amended in 2017 to replace the phrase \u201cfifteen years\u201d\nwith \u201cthe number of years specified below\u201d and to add specific repose periods for various\ncategories of real property. However, the amendment does not alter the statute of repose for the\npending claim which is subject to the fifteen year period because Thorne\u2019s alleged exposure\nhistory occurred between 1971-1974. See Iowa Code \u00a7 614.1(11) (2017) (noting \u201c{t]his section,\nPlaintiffs\u2019 action was filed on March 25, 2020. (D.I. 1) Therefore, the statute of repose\noperates to bar Plaintiffs\u2019 claims to the extent they are based on the unsafe or defective condition\nof an improvement to real property and the acts or omissions of a Defendant alleged to have\ncaused the injury occurred prior to March 25, 2005.\n\nThe dispositive issue is whether Thorne\u2019s work on the valve\u2019s component parts caused\nhis alleged injuries in the course of an ordinary repair not subject to the statute of repose. See\nKrull v. Thermogas Co. of Northwood, Iowa, Div. of Mapco Gas Prods., Inc., 522 N.W. 2d 607,\n611 (lowa 1994). Plaintiffs argue that the facts of this case involve ordinary repairs. (D.I. 60 at\n7-10) Plaintiffs contend that Thorne\u2019s injuries occurred after the component part was\npermanently detached from the real property and had no further use as an improvement rendering\nit \u201cuseless scrap.\u201d (/d.)\n\nThe leading case on Iowa\u2019s statute of repose is Kinseth v. Weil-McLain, 913 N.W. 2d 55\n(Iowa 2018), in which the Iowa Supreme Court favorably cited to the trial court\u2019s ninety-eight\npage decision addressing multiple defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions, including the trial\ncourt\u2019s statute of repose analysis that was not the subject of the appeal. See Kinseth v. Weil-\nMcLain, 913 N.W. 2d 55, 64, 75 (lowa 2018); see Kinseth v. A.Y. McDonald Indus., Inc., et al.,\nWright County, Iowa District Court No. LACV022887, at #30 (October 11, 2010) (unpublished);\n(DL. 60, Ex. 7) The Iowa Supreme Court applied the trial court\u2019s analysis of the statute of\nrepose to the issue on appeal concerning whether the trial court properly excluded a valve\nmanufacturer on the allocation-of-fault verdict form. Kinseth, 913 N.W. 2d at 75-77. The court\n\nheld that the plaintiffs did not have a viable claim against the valve manufacturer because \u201c[a]ny\n\nas amended by Acts 2017 (87 G.A.) ch. 64, S.F. 413, does not apply to an improvement to real\nproperty in existence prior to the effective date of this Act [July 1, 2017]...\u201d).\nexposure to asbestos during the refurbishment process...is not compensable under the statute of\nrepose and thus cannot be grounds to include [the valve manufacturer] as a responsible third\nparty\u201d on the allocation-of-fault verdict form. Kinseth, 913 N.W. 2d at 76. The court agreed\nwith the trial court\u2019s reasoning that \u201conce a fixture had been installed, it constituted an\nimprovement to real property\u201d and, \u201c{a]ccordingly, any exposure to asbestos while removing\nboilers or other fixtures arose out of an improvement to real property and was barred by the\nstatute of repose.\u201d Kinseth, 913 N.W. 2d at 64, 75 (emphasis in original). Likewise, the court\nagreed that \u201conce a component part, such as a valve, becomes part of an improvement to real\nproperty, it does not lose its status as an improvement once it is detached and refurbished.\u201d Jd. at\n75. The court distinguished removal and repair from installation of a fixture, finding that \u201cany\nexposure to asbestos while installing boilers or other fixtures was not barred\u201d by the statute of\nrepose. Jd. (emphasis in original).\n\nThe trial court in Kinseth provided a thorough review of all prior rulings of the lowa\ncourts interpreting \u201can improvement to real property\u201d within the meaning of the statute of\nrepose. (D.I. 60, Ex. 7); Kinseth, lowa District Court No. LACV022887, at *30. First, in Krull\nv. Thermogas Co., the lowa Supreme Court ruled that a gas furnace control valve on an\nexploding furnace qualified as an improvement to real property because it: \u201c(1) enhanced the\nhome\u2019s value, (2) involved the expenditure of labor or money, and (3) was designed to make the\nhome more useful or valuable.\u201d Krull, 522 N.W. 2d at 612.\n\nSubsequently, the Iowa Supreme Court in Buttz v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.\nconsidered whether the definition in Krull applied to an asbestos containing product. Buttz v.\nOwens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 557 N.W. 2d 90 (Iowa 1996). In Buttz, the plaintiffs alleged\n\ninjuries due to exposure to asbestos dust during the application of insulation products that\nbecame attached to steam lines, boilers, and other parts of the building at plaintiffs\u2019 worksite. Id.\nat 91-92. The court ruled that under the Krull definition, the insulation products in their\nunattached state were not permanent additions to or betterment of real property, thus, they could\nnot be considered \u201cimprovements\u201d and the statute of repose was not applicable to bar the\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims. Jd. at 92 (emphasis added).\n\nHowever, a year later, in Tallman v. W.R. Grace & Company-Conn., the lowa Supreme\nCourt adopted a \u201cbright-line test\u201d as the standard for determining whether an asbestos product\nhad become an improvement. Tallman v. W.R. Grace & Company-Conn., 558 N.W. 2d 208,\n210-211 (lowa 1997). The product at issue was spray fireproofing applied to structural steel and\nother building surfaces. Jd. at 209. The plaintiff, an electrician, alleged that he \u201cbreathed\nasbestos dust...when the excess product fell from the ceiling support wires and when he removed\nit from inside of electrical boxes\u201d during the wiring process. Jd. The court ruled that plaintiff's\nclaim was time-barred under the statute of repose because it was undisputed that the fireproofing\nproduct had become physically attached to the building at the time the plaintiff was exposed to\nthe excess product and, thus, it was an improvement within the meaning of the statute. Jd. at\n210-211.\n\nIn Harder v. ACandS, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that an asbestos\ncontaining product that had once been attached to the property but was temporarily detached at\nthe time of the plaintiff's alleged exposure did not lose its status as an improvement to real\nproperty. Harder v. ACandS, 179 F.3d 609, 613 (8th Cir. 1999). The product was a thermal\ninsulation blanket originally attached to a steam turbine at a power plant. Jd. at 611. The\nplaintiff removed the thermal insulation blankets for overhauling the turbine as part of general\n\nmaintenance. Jd. The plaintiff alleged he breathed asbestos dust after the blankets were\nremoved and while cleaning the floor where the blankets were stored after removal. Id. The\nEighth Circuit reversed the trial court, which found that the blankets lost their status as\nimprovements while they were temporarily detached. Jd. The Eighth Circuit ruled that reviving\nliability \u201clong after it has expired based on the improvement\u2019s temporary detachment is contrary\nto Iowa\u2019s \u2018legislative policy decision to close the door after fifteen years on certain claims\narising from improvements to real property.\u2019\u201d Jd. at 613 (quoting Bob McKiness Excavating &\nGrading, Inc. v. Morton Buildings, Inc., 507 N.W.2d 405, 409 (lowa 1993)). Furthermore, the\ncourt did not think that the lowa Supreme Court \u201cwould gut Iowa\u2019s statute of repose in this\nway.\u201d Id.\n\nAfter carefully examining the evolution of the caselaw interpreting an improvement to\nreal property under Iowa\u2019s statute of repose, the court in Kinseth held that the statute of repose\nbarred the plaintiffs\u2019 claim arising from asbestos exposure during the refurbishing of pumps that\nrequired removal of old asbestos gaskets and replacement with new ones. (D.I. 60, Ex. 7 at 17-\n25, 29-34) The plaintiffs argued that their claim against the pump manufacturer fell outside of\nthe scope of the Iowa statute of repose because: \u201c(1) [the] injury occurred during the course of an\n\u2018ordinary repair,\u2019 (2) to a component part that had been rendered scrap, no longer enhancing the\nvalue of the real property, and, perhaps more importantly (3) the component part causing injury\nhad been permanently detached from the real property at the time the injury occurred.\u201d (Jd. at\n29) The court disagreed, finding that the pumps had been physically attached to the real property\nfor the requisite time period before the exposure during refurbishment. (/d. at 29-31) The\ndetachment of the component part does not cause it to lose its status as an improvement once it is\n\ndetached and later repaired or refurbished. (/d.) \u201cTo rule otherwise would gut the policy of the\n\n10\nstatute of repose...and expose the manufacturers of component parts, such as valves, to potential\nperpetual liability.\u201d (Jd. at 33); see Harder, 179 F.3d at 613.\n\nPlaintiffs in the instant case reassert the same arguments that the court rejected in Kinseth\nfor the reasons stated, supra. (D.I. 60 at 7-10, Ex. 7 at 29) Here, the Plaintiffs assert that the old\ngasket material is waste that does not enhance the value of real property, and Thorne\u2019s injuries\noccurred after the gasket was permanently removed. (/d.) The court recommends following\nKinseth in holding that once Crane Co. valves were attached and used as part of a properly\nworking hot water heating system, the valves \u201cwere permanent additions to or betterment of real\nproperty that enhanced the property\u2019s capital value.\u201d (D.I. 60, Ex. 7 at 30); see Krull, 522 N.W.\n2d at 612; Kinseth, lowa District Court No. LACV022887, at *30. The valves \u201cdid not lose their\nstatus as improvements when they were permanently detached and refurbished.\u201d (Jd. at 31); see\nKinseth, 913 N.W. 2d at 64, 75.\n\nFurthermore, Plaintiffs have introduced no evidence in the record that Thome\u2019s alleged\nexposure occurred during installation of a new Crane Co. valve with asbestos-containing gaskets\nor component parts. Accordingly, to the extent that Thorne was exposed to asbestos from an\nasbestos-containing product during refurbishment of a Crane Co. valve, the valve having been\npreviously attached to and part of a properly working hot water heating system for the requisite\nfifteen-year period, the exposure is within the ambit of Section 614.1(11). (dd. at 30-31)\nThorne\u2019s claim against Crane Co. based upon his exposure to asbestos during the refurbishment\nprocess is barred by operation of the statute of repose. There is no evidence in the record that\nwhen Thorne refurbished the Crane Co. valves with asbestos-containing packing or gaskets,\nCrane Co. manufactured or sold the packing or gaskets. Therefore, the court recommends\n\ngranting Crane Co.\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\n\n11\nb. Substantial Factor Causation\n\nShould it be determined that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not barred by the statute of repose,\nthere is no dispute of material fact sufficient to raise a reasonable inference that a Crane Co.\nproduct was a substantial factor in causing Thorne\u2019s injuries.\n\nUnder Iowa law, \u201ca plaintiff in a products liability case must prove that the injury-\ncausing product was a product manufactured or supplied by the defendant.\u201d Kinseth, lowa\nDistrict Court No. LACV022887, at *25 (quoting Spaur v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 510\nN.W. 2d 854, 858 (Iowa 1994)). Iowa law requires that the plaintiff establish his exposure to\nasbestos from a particular product was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing his injuries. Jd. The\nIowa Supreme Court in Spaur held that the \u201cfrequency, regularity and proximity\u201d test adopted by\nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Lohrmann v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp. is \u201cused to\nanalyze the sufficiency of evidence needed to satisfy the substantial factor requirement,\u201d but that\nit is not \u201ca rigid test with a minimum threshold level of proof required under each prong.\u201d\nSpaur, 510 N.W. 2d at 859; see Lohrmann v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp., 782 F.2d 1156, 1163\n(4th Cir. 1986). In determining substantial factor causation, courts consider: \u201c(1) the nature of\nthe product, (2) the frequency of its use, (3) the proximity, in distance and time, of a plaintiff to\nthe use of a product, and (4) the regularity of the exposure of that plaintiff to the use of that\nproduct.\u201d Spaur, 510 N.W. 2d at 859 (citing Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc. v. Balbos, 604 A. 2d 445,\n460 (Md. Ct. App. 1992).\n\nEven if the court accepts that Thorne has sufficiently identified exposure to Crane Co.\nproducts during the course of his work at Minot, the Plaintiffs must show that a material issue of\n\nfact exists concerning whether such products were a substantial factor in causing their alleged\n\n12\ninjuries. See id. at 858 (quoting Mulcahy v. Eli Lilly & Co., 386 N.W. 2d 67, 72, 76 (lowa\n1986)).\n\nAs a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs do not recite the factors for substantial factor causation\nunder Spaur, supra, nor do they apply the test to the facts of this case. See id. at 859. However,\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, Crane Co. sold valves that\ncontained asbestos gaskets and packing through the mid-1980s. (D.I. 60, Ex. 2 at 10:10-20,\n63:17-23, 90:22-91:2; Ex. 3 at 22:10-20) Crane Co.\u2019s brochures and catalogs listed asbestos\npacking and asbestos gaskets under the category of design data and features. (/d., Ex. 2 at 84:11-\n86:22; Ex. 6 at 5) Executives of Crane Co. testified in other asbestos litigation that Crane Co.\nvalves used gaskets and packing that contained asbestos. (/d., Ex. 2 at 10:10-20, 63:17-23,\n90:22-91:2; Ex. 3 at 7:17-8:1, 15:17-21, 20:4-9, 22:10-20) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs\nargue that it was foreseeable to Crane Co. that workers would have to cut, remove and replace\nasbestos packing and gaskets when working on Crane Co. valves. (D.I. 60 at 4) Furthermore,\nPlaintiffs argue that Crane Co. sold its own brand of replacement components, including asbestos\nsheet gaskets called \u201cCranite.\u201d (Jd. at 4-5)\n\nHere, however, aside from asserting generally that Crane Co. valves had asbestos\ncomponents, the Plaintiffs have failed to show that Thome was exposed to asbestos from an\noriginal Crane Co. valve or an asbestos-containing component manufactured or sold by Crane\nCo., or that a material issue of fact exists as to whether it was a substantial factor in causing his\ninjuries. (D.I. 60 at 2-5, 11-18) Thorne\u2019s testimony does not support evidence of purchase of\nreplacement parts from Crane Co. (Id., Ex. 1 at 8-15) Thorne has not identified any insulation,\n\npacking or gasket materials made or sold by Crane Co. and used in the removal, repair or\n\n13\nreplacement of Crane Co. valves. He never identified Cranite* as a product he used in\nrefurbishment of Crane Co. valves at Minot. He testified that the replacement packing he used\nwas made by Garlock. (Jd. at 23:20-24:25, 26:3-9, 55:22-56:4, 210:22-213:6) He has offered no\ntestimony to create a material issue of fact as to the frequency and regularity of his work with\nCrane Co. valves. Therefore, the court recommends granting Crane Co.\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment.\n\nce. No Liability for Third Party Components\n\nSetting aside the statute of repose and substantial factor causation, an independent\nstatutory basis exists for granting Crane Co.\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Iowa Code\ninsulates a defendant from liability in an asbestos action when the alleged harmful exposure is\nfrom a product or component made or sold by a third party. Iowa Code \u00a7 686B.7(5) (\u201cA\ndefendant in an asbestos action or silica action shall not be liable for exposures from a product or\ncomponent part made or sold by a third party\u201d).\n\nPlaintiffs acknowledged in their brief on choice of law that \u201c[i]Jn Iowa, Defendants could\nnot be held liable for the component parts, including gaskets, packing, and insulation\nrecommended for, supplied, and utilized with their products.\u201d (D.I. 50 at 4) Plaintiffs have not\naddressed this statement in their answering brief on summary judgment and, instead, argue that\nCrane Co. should be liable for injuries caused by the foreseeable use of asbestos gaskets with\nCrane Co. valves. (D.I. 60 at 13-18) Plaintiffs have thus waived any argument regarding the\nIowa statute\u2019s applicability to the instant case. See Progressive Sterilization, LLC v. Turbett\nSurgical LLC, 2020 WL 1849709, at *3 n.4 (D. Del. Apr. 13, 2020) (\u201cSuch arguments were not\n5 Cranite was a brand name of long fiber asbestos sheet gaskets produced for Crane Co. by\nGoodrich Goodwin Suite Rubber Company. (D.I. 60 at 4, Ex. 2 at 15:3-20) Crane Co.\n\nrecommended Cranite for use with its hot water and steam valves. (Id., Ex. 2 at 52:6-55:2, Ex. 4\nat 5)\n\n14\nfound in Plaintiff's answering brief (and should have been), ...and thus, they are waived for\npurposes of resolving this motion\u201d); see also U.S. v. Fleetwood Enters., Inc., 689 F. Supp. 389,\n392 (D. Del. 1988).\n\nFurthermore, Plaintiffs have not cited to any facts in the record that Crane Co. was the\nmanufacturer or seller of any of the component parts, e.g., insulation, rope packing, or gasket\nmaterials, that Thorne used in the removal, replacement or repacking of Crane Co. valves.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability for negligence in failing to warn of asbestos hazards and\nstrict liability for a hazardous product rests upon a foreseeability test for which Plaintiffs have no\ncurrent case authority under Iowa law. Rather, Plaintiffs predominately rely on New York and\nVirginia state and federal case law, along with several other jurisdictions noted in footnote 97 of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 answering brief. (D.I. 60 at 15-17, n.97) Plaintiffs have not cited to any Iowa case\nauthority indicating that Iowa follows a foreseeability analysis in this instance. Instead, the\nconcept of foreseeability is not applicable, here, where Iowa has specifically insulated\nmanufacturers from liability for third party component parts. See Beverage v. Alcoa, Inc., 958\nN.W. 2d 611, at *3-4 (lowa Ct. App. 2021). Thus, Iowa Code \u00a7 686B.7(5) bars Crane Co.\u2019s\nliability on the instant record. Accordingly, the court recommends granting Crane Co.\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment.\n\nd. Strict Liability\n\nThe court recommends that summary judgment be granted in favor of Crane Co. because\nPlaintiffs\u2019 foreseeability arguments discussed, supra, are contrary to Iowa law insulating\nmanufacturers from liability for component parts made or sold by third parties. See Sections\n\nIV(b)-(c), discussed supra.\n\n15\nIowa has adopted the Restatement (Third) of Torts that a product \u201cis defective because of\ninadequate instructions or warnings when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product\ncould have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings...\u201d\nRestatement (Third) of Torts: Prod. Liab. \u00a7 2 (1998). The lowa Supreme Court has held that\nthere is \u201cno real difference between strict liability and negligence principles in failure-to-warn\ncases.\u201d Wright v. Brooke Group Ltd., 652 N.W. 2d 159, 167-169 (lowa 2002); see Restatement\n(Third) of Torts: Prod. Liab. \u00a7 2 cmt. n (\u201cThe rules in this Section...are stated functionally rather\nthan in terms of traditional doctrinal categories...such as negligence or strict liability\u201d).\n\nPlaintiffs argue that based on the Restatement (Third) of Torts, Crane Co. had a duty to\nwarn of the dangers of asbestos gaskets and packing manufactured by third parties because Crane\nCo. designed and recommended its valves be used with asbestos gaskets and packing, supplied\nthe asbestos parts with its valves, and sold asbestos replacement gaskets. (D.I. 60 at 13-18)\nHowever, Plaintiffs make these arguments without pointing to anything in the record other than\ngeneral conclusions derived from discovery in unrelated litigation with no citation in this record\nthat Thorne\u2019s work on Crane Co. valves at Minot involved replacement packing and gaskets\nmade or sold by Crane Co. Therefore, Plaintiffs do not make a showing of any evidence in the\nrecord to create a material issue of fact that would preclude summary judgment on this claim.\n\ne. Punitive Damages\n\nThe recommendations of the court in sections IV(a)-(c), supra, for entry of judgment as a\nmatter of law in favor of Crane Co. render moot the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for punitive damages.\n\nEven if the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for compensatory damages survived summary judgment,\nPlaintiffs have not shown that a material issue of fact exists concerning an award of punitive\n\ndamages. Under Iowa law, the standard for awarding punitive damages is a \u201cpreponderance of\n\n16\nclear, convincing, and satisfactory evidence that the defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to a willful\nand wanton disregard for the rights or safety of another.\u201d Kinseth, 913 N.W. 2d at 78-79\n(quoting Beeman v. Manville Corp. Asbestos Disease Comp. Fund, 496 N.W. 2d 247, 255 (Iowa\n1993).\n\nPlaintiffs argue only that Crane Co.\u2019s knowledge of the dangers of asbestos as of the\n1960s, if not the 1930s, demonstrates conscious indifference and willfulness in failing to warn\nusers of asbestos hazards. (D.I. 60 at 18-20) However, the Plaintiffs have not pointed to any\nevidence in the record sufficient to create a material issue of fact as to whether the Defendant\nacted with malice or reckless disregard for the safety of Thorne.\n\nf. Loss of Consortium\n\nUnder Iowa law, an independent claim for loss of consortium will not survive if the\nDefendant is not liable as a matter of law for the underlying claims of the injured spouse. See\nKelly v. Ethicon, Inc., 511 F. Supp. 3d 939, 955-956 (N.D. Iowa 2021). Thorne\u2019s spouse is in no\nbetter position than Thorne and has not demonstrated any issues of material fact precluding\ndismissal of her claim. For the reasons discussed in sections IV(a)-(c), supra, the court\nrecommends dismissing the loss of consortium claim as a matter of law.\n\ng. Causes of Action Not Addressed in Plaintiffs\u2019 Answering Brief\ni. Misrepresentation and Concealment\n\nThe court recommends that summary judgment be granted in favor of Crane Co. because\nPlaintiffs do not address Crane Co.\u2019s argument with respect to the misrepresentation and\nconcealment counts, thus, any opposition is waived. (D.I. 56 at 13-14; see D.I. 60); see\n\nProgressive Sterilization, 2020 WL 1849709, at *3 n.4; see also Fleetwood Enters., 689 F. Supp.\n\n17\nat 392. The court recommends granting Crane Co.\u2019s motion for summary judgment on these\ncounts.\nii. Conspiracy\n\nThe court recommends that summary judgment be granted in favor of Crane Co. because\nPlaintiffs do not address Crane Co.\u2019s argument with respect to the conspiracy count, thus, any\nopposition is waived. (D.I. 56 at 14; see D.I. 60); see Progressive Sterilization, 2020 WL\n1849709, at *3 n.4; see also Fleetwood Enters., 689 F. Supp. at 392. The court recommends\ngranting Crane Co.\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this count.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court recommends GRANTING Crane Co.\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment.
