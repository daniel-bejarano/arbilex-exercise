INTRODUCTION ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) Civ. No. 18-933-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nPlaintiff Amir Fatir, an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, in \nSmyrna, Delaware, filed a motion for my recusal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 and \u00a7 144. \n(D.I. 108) Antonio R. Bailey, Jermaine D. Laster, and Robert W. Johnson, Jr. are also \nnamed plaintiffs. \nII. DISCUSSION \nFatir has submitted an affidavit to support his motion for my disqualification under \n\u00a7 144. (D.I. 108 at 4) Section 144 provides that \"[w]henever a party to any \nproceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the \njudge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against \nhim or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein.\" \nPlaintiff submitted a five paragraph affidavit in support of his motion. (Id.) \nIn the affidavit, Plaintiff states that: (1) he recently learned that while I was the \nU.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware, I was specially detached to the Delaware \n1 Department of Justice to work in partnership with DOJ attorneys to prosecute Thomas \nCapano; (2) he believes that the relationship makes the DOJ opposing counsel my \ndefacto former law partners; (3) the DOJ represents Defendant Russel; and (4) the \ninterlocking relationship presents a possible conflict of interest, personal bias, the \nappearance of impropriety and prejudice against Plaintiffs and prejudice in favor of \nDefendants. (D.I. 108 at 4, ,m 2-5) \nAs a threshold matter, it is the responsibility of the district judge against whom an \naffidavit is filed to assess the legal sufficiency of the affidavit. United States v. \nTownsend, 478 F.2d 1072, 1073 (3d Cir. 1973) (stating that the mere filing of an \naffidavit \"does not automatically disqualify a judge\"). The United States Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit has held that the challenged judge must determine only the \nsufficiency of the affidavit, not the truth of the assertions. Mims v. Shapp, 541 F .2d \n415,417 (3d Cir. 1976). An affidavit is legally sufficient if the facts alleged therein: \n(1) are \"material\" and \"stated with particularity,\" (2) \"would convince a reasonable \nperson that a bias exists,\" and (3) evince bias that \"is personal, as opposed to judicial, \nin nature.\" United States v. Thompson, 483 F .2d 527, 528 (3d Cir. 1973). \nHere, it is evident that Fatir's allegations of bias consist of subjective conclusions \nbased upon a case I prosecuted over twenty years ago. See Jones v. Pittsburgh Nat'/ \nCorp., 899 F.2d 1350, 1356 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that, to be legally sufficient, an \naffidavit must contain more than mere conclusory allegations). Evaluating Fatir's \naffidavit and motion for recusal, I find no basis from which to conclude that the Court \nhas a personal bias or prejudice against Plaintiffs or in favor or any Defendant to \n2 warrant recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. Significantly, Fatir has failed to carry his \nburden of making the threefold showing as to (1) specific facts (2) that could convince a \nreasonable person that a bias exists and (3) that the bias was personal as opposed to \njudicial in nature. United States v. Thompson, 483 F.2d at 528. To the contrary, Fatir \nhas presented conclusory and broad statements premised entirely on conjecture. Fatir \nhas not met the requirements of\u00a7 144, and his motion for my recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n144 will be denied. \nFatir also seeks my recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n455(a), a judge is required to recuse himself \"in any proceeding in which his impartiality \nmight reasonably be questioned.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). The test for recusal under\u00a7 \n455(a) is whether a \"reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts, would conclude \nthat the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\" In re Kensington Int'/ Ltd., \n368 F.3d 289, 301 (3d Cir. 2004), not \"whether a judge actually harbors bias against a \nparty,\" United States v. Kennedy, 682 F.3d 244,258 (3d Cir. 2012). Under\u00a7 455(b)(1), \na judge is required to recuse himself \"[w]here he has a personal bias or prejudice \nconcerning a party.\" \nPlaintiff's ground for recusal arises under\u00a7 455(b)(3). Under\u00a7 455(b)(3), a \njudge is required to recuse himself \"[w]here he has served in governmental employment \nand in such capacity participated as counsel, advisor or material witness concerning the \nproceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in \ncontroversy.\" With regard to a judge who formerly served in the United States \nAttorney's Office, \"absent a specific showing that that judge was previously involved \n3 with a case while in the U.S. Attorney's office that he or she is later assigned to preside \nover as a judge,\u00a7 455(b)(3) does not mandate recusal.\" United States v. Di Pasquale, \n864 F .2d 271, 279 (3d Cir 1988). Fatir offers no evidence that I was involved in this \ncase while I served in the United States Attorney's Office. Nor has Fatir established \nthat a reasonable person would conclude that my impartiality might be questioned \nbased on his prior employment as the United States Attorney for the District of \nDelaware or as Assistant United States Attorney. See generally Liteky v. United \nStates, 510 U.S. 540,555 (1994); Brown v. Mace-Liebson, 779 F. App'x 136, 142-43 \n(3d Cir. 2019). Moreover, after careful and deliberate consideration, I conclude that I \nhave no actual bias or prejudice towards Fatir and that a reasonable, well-informed \nobserver would not question my impartiality. After considering Fatir's assertions, I \nconclude that there are no grounds for my recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455. \nIll. DISMISSAL OF BAILEY \nOn March 30, 2021, the Court ordered Plaintiff Antonio R. Bailey, on or before \nApril 30, 2021, to pay the $2.81 initial partial filing fee he owed and to either file a long \nform application to proceed without prepayment of fees and affidavit so that the Court \nmay determine whether he is still eligible to proceed without prepayment of the balance \nof the $350.00 filing fee or pay the filing fee owed (after payment of the initial partial \nfiling fee.). The time has lapsed, and Bailey has not complied with the Court's March \n30, 2021. Therefore, Bailey will be dismissed without prejudice for failure to comply \nwith the Court's March 30, 2021 Order. \n4 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny the motion for recusal (D.I. 108) \nand (2) dismiss Plaintiff Antonio R. Bailey for failure to comply with the Court's March 30, \n2021 Order. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \nJanuary I I\" , 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware Chief Judge \n5 "}
