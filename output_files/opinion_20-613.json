(\"ROSS\") for copyright infringement and tortious interference \nwith contract. (See generally D.I. 1) (\"Compl.\") ROSS asserts a variety of counterclaims , \nincluding violations of the Sherman Act and the unfair competition laws of both California and \nDelaware . (See generally D.I. 36 at 11-46) Plaintiffs move to dismiss the antitrust and unfair \ncompetition counterclaims. (D.I. 39) For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant \nPlaintiffs' motion in part and deny it in part. \nBACKGROUND1 \nA. Factual Allegations2 \nPlaintiffs Thomson Reuters and West operate and market Westlaw, a legal search \nplatform. (D.I. 36 at 11 ,r 5) Plaintiffs control \"over 80% of the market for legal search \nplatform products, \" so some consider Westlaw to be the \"king\" of legal research. (Id.) \nWestlaw has a comprehensive database of \"public law,\" comprising federal and state court \ndecisions, federal and state statutes, and administrati ve rules and guidance. (Id. at 11 ,r 2; see \nalso id. at 17 ,r 39) Because Westlaw's public law database is so comprehensive , Westlaw \"has \n1 In a previous Memorandum Opinion, the Court outlined Plaintiffs' allegations against \nROSS. See Thomson Reuters Enter. Ctr. GmbHv. ROSS Intel. Inc., 529 F. Supp. 3d 303, 307-10 \n(D. Del. 2021). That background is not repeated here, as the instant Memorandum Opinion \nfocuses on ROSS 's allegations against Plaintiffs . \n2 The factual allegations in this section are taken primarily from ROSS's amended \ncounterclaims and the parties' papers. At this stage, the Court must take ROSS's well-pled \nfactual allegations as true. \n1 been the standard ... since before any practicing lawyer was born,\" and legal researchers \"can \nfeel confident when looking for cases in Westlaw's digital collection .\" (Id. at 18 ,r 44) Yet \nWestlaw's vast amount of public law information is not particularly helpful without a way to \nsearch within that information . (See id. at 26 ,r 78) (\"[I]f the database is not connected to a legal \nsearch tool, then it holds no value.\") Thus, Westlaw incorporates a search tool that allows \nresearchers to sift through the public law. (Id. at 18 ,r 45) The \"backbone \" ofWestlaw 's search \ntool is the West Key Number System, which \"organizes numerous legal topics and then \nsubclassifies them into key numbers based on legal issues and points oflaw.\" (D.I. 28 at 4-5) \nAttorney-editors are constantly reviewing cases to distill crucial points of law into headnotes and \nto organize the headnotes by key number. (See id. at 5) \nDespite Westlaw's dominance , ROSS endeavored to develop a new and improved legal \nsearch platform using artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). (D.I. 36 at 14 ,r 24) ROSS sold access to \nits legal search platform for \"a tiny fraction\" of Westlaw's cost. (Id. at 15 ,r 25) Given its low \ncost and ease of use, ROS S's legal search product garnered significant support from customers , \nthe media, and bar associations. (See id. at 24 ,r 68) But ROSS struggled to build a public law \ndatabase that was even remotely as comprehensi ve as Westlaw's. (See id. at 15 ,r 28; see also id. \nat 25 ,r,r 73-74; id. at 12 ,r 7 (\"ROSS never really had a chance.\")) ROSS partnered with \nLegalEase Solutions, LLC (\"LegalEase \") to improve ROSS 's search tool. According to \nPlaintiffs, however, LegalEase \"used a bot ... to download and store mass quantities of \nproprietary information, \" which it then provided to ROSS. (D.I. 28 at 6) Ultimately , ROSS \nwas \"forced to suspend business activities. \" (D.I. 38 at 7) \n2 ROSS is pursuing antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims against Plaintiffs , \nseeking to stop them from \"engaging in an exclusionary and anticompetitive course of conduct to \nmaintain [their] monopoly and restrain trade.\" (DJ. 36 at 12 ,r 7) Several allegations regarding \nthe competitive landscape are central to ROSS's counterclaims. First, Plaintiffs have \"never \nprovided consumers with an option to only license the public law database, or to only license the \nlegal search tools, and do[] not plan to ever provide such an option.\" (Id. at 32 ,r 104) That is \ntrue even though, according to ROSS, there are three separate but related markets for (i) public \nlaw database products, (ii) legal search tool products, and (iii) legal search platforms . (DJ. 38 at \n7-8) ROSS further alleges there is \"independent demand\" by consumers for public law \ndatabases and legal search tools, to permit legal researchers to \"mix-and-match products based \non particular preferences and needs.\" (Id. at 5-6) Moreover, Plaintiffs allegedly require their \ncustomers to sign \"contract[s] of adhesion \" (DJ. 36 at 32 ,r 103) containing \"restrictive licensing \nconditions\" that prevent competitors from gaining access to Plaintiffs ' proprietary information \n(id. at 33 ,r,r 107-08). Finally, Plaintiffs allegedly intermingle copyrighted material with \nuncopyrightable government edicts, rendering it \"not difficult\" for Plaintiffs to \"find a way\" to \nsue their rivals for copyright infringement , even though such lawsuits are \"a complete sham.\" \n(Id. at 34-35 ,r,r 110-11) \nB. Procedural History \nIn May 2020, Plaintiffs sued ROSS for copyright infringement and tortious interference \nwith a contract between West and LegalEase . (See Compl. ,r,r 40-53) The Court denied \nROSS's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. See Thomson Reuters, 529 \nF. Supp. 3d at 315. \n3 In December 2020, ROSS partially answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims \nagainst Plaintiffs, seeking declaratory judgment of copyright invalidity, copyright \nnoninfringement, and no tortious interference with contract. (See generally D.I. 21 ,r,r 17-37) \nPlaintiffs answered the counterclaims. (See generally D.I. 23) ROSS subsequently amended \nits answer and added the following counterclaims: (a) declaratory judgment of fair use, \n(b) declaratory judgment of copyright misuse, ( c) violation of the Sherman Act \u00a7 2, ( d) violation \nof the Sherman Act\u00a7 1, (e) violation of California 's unfair competition law, and (f) violation of \nDelaware common law on unfair competition. (See generally D.I. 24 ,r,r 116-80) \nPlaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaims involving the alleged violations of federal \nantitrust law and state unfair competition law (Counts VI-IX). (See generally D.I. 27, 28) In \nlight of the Court's intervening denial ofROSS 's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs ' copyright \ninfringement and tortious interference claims, ROSS again filed amended counterclaims with the \nsame nine counts. (See generally D.I. 36) \nPlaintiffs filed a second motion to dismiss Counts VI-IX. (D.I. 39)3 The Court has \ncarefully considered all arguments raised in the parties' briefs (see generally D.I. 28, 38, 45), as \nwell as arguments made by counsel during an in-person hearing on the pending motion (see D.I. \n69) (\"Tr.\"). \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(6) requires the \nCourt to accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 \n3 The Court denied the first motion to dismiss as moot, in light of subsequent filings. \n(See generally D.I. 160) \n4 F.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir. 2004 ). \"'The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but \nwhether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, \n236 (1974)). Therefore, the Court may grant such a motion to dismiss \"only if, accepting all well\u00ad\npleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, \nplaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \n\"To survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that 'raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true \n( even if doubtful in fact).\"' Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) ( quoting \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible \"when the \nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nUltimately, \"[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that \ndiscovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\" of a plaintiff's claim. Wilkerson v. \nNew Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nThe Court is not obligated to accept \"bald assertions\" as true. Morse v. Lower Merion \nSch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor is it \nobligated to credit \"unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences.\" Schuylkill Energy \nRes., Inc. v. Pa. Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405,417 (3d Cir. 1997). The Court may likewise \nreject allegations that are \"self-evidently false.\" Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1996). \n5 DISCUSSION \nI. Antitrust Counterclaims \nA. Sherman Act \u00a7 2 \nA violation of\u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, \"requires '(l) the possession of \nmonopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that \npower as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, \nbusiness acumen, or historic accident.\"' Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 306-\n07 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71 (1966)).4 \n1. Tying \nROSS's first theory for its claim under\u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act alleges that Plaintiffs \nunlawfully tie their legal search tool to their public law database to maintain their dominance in \nthe overall market for legal search platforms . (See Tr. at 35) \"A tying arrangement is an \nagreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a \ndifferent ( or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other \nsupplier.\" Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451,461 (1992) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \"[T]he essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in \nthe seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase \nof a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase \n4 The Court will address the two theories ROSS is pressing in connection with its \u00a7 2 \nclaim. ROSS clarified in its briefing that it is not relying on the \"essential facilities doctrine\" \n(D.I. 38 at 2), and at the hearing, ROSS withdrew its \"refusal to deal\" claim (Tr. at 43). ROSS \nhad been pursuing a claim based on Plaintiffs ' refusal to deal with ROSS. (See D.I. 38 at 17-19) \n(citing Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585 (1985)). The Court will \ndismiss that claim in light of ROSS 's withdrawal of it. \n6 elsewhere on different terms.\" Jefferson Par. Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 12 (1984). \nIn a tying arrangement, there must be ''two separate products. \" Id. at 18. \"[W]hether one or \ntwo products are involved turns not on the functional relation between them, but rather on the \ncharacter of the demand for the two items.\" Id. at 19; see also Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 462 \n(\"For service and parts to be considered two distinct products, there must be sufficient consumer \ndemand so that it is efficient for a firm to provide service separately from parts.\"). \nPlaintiffs ' basis for seeking to dismiss the \u00a7 2 tying claim is that ROSS has not \nsufficiently alleged two different products or two different product markets. (D.I. 28 at 13; Tr. \nat 13) ROSS responds that public law databases and legal search tools are separate products, \nciting as support its own experience of developing a legal search tool while separately \n\"buil[ ding] its public law database \" by \"purchas[ing] some cases from Casemaker\" and \"other \npublic law from Fastcase. \" (D.I. 36 at 24 ,r 71) ROSS further alleges that its legal search tool \nproduct was \"incredibly valuable.\" (Id. at 25 ,r 73) As ROSS puts it, \"[c]ustomers valued \nROSS's legal search tool so highly ... because it is built with innovative AI-based technology. \" \n(D.I. 38 at 14) ROSS's experience suggests that building a public law database product is \ndistinct from developing a legal search tool product. \nIn arguing that public law databases and legal search tools are just one product (i.e., a \nlegal search platform), Plaintiffs emphasize that their legal search tool has never been sold \nseparately from their public law database. (See, e.g., Tr. at 11; see also D.I. 36 at 24 ,r 69 \n(ROSS admitting that Plaintiffs have \"never offered to license [their] database separate from \n[their] search tools\")) Plaintiffs are correct that if two products have never been sold separately , \nthis suggests that they are really one product. See generally Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 462 \n7 (noting that products were previously sold separately) ; see also D.I. 45 at 5 (citing additional \ncases). As ROSS points out, however, Plaintiffs ' public law database was effectively sold as a \nstand-alone product in the form of books for decades before modem technology allowed \nPlaintiffs to develop an online legal search tool. (See Tr. at 31) (\"In the 19th century, West \nbegan to sell case law separate from any digest that could be used to search.\") Moreover, some \nthird parties have allegedly sold public law databases as discrete products. (See D.I. 36 at 24-25 \n,r 71) (describing how ROSS purchased cases from Casemaker and Fastcase) \nPlaintiffs argue that their legal search tool is effectively useless without a public law \ndatabase attached to it. (D.I. 28 at 14) But the Supreme Court has \"often found arrangements \ninvolving functionally linked products[,] at least one of which is useless without the other[,] to \nbe prohibited tying devices.\" Jefferson Par., 466 U.S. at 19 n.30; see also United States v. \nMicrosoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 86 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (en bane) (\"[T]he mere fact that two items are \ncomplements ... does not make them a single 'product' for purposes of tying law.\"). \nTaking ROSS's allegations as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in ROSS's \nfavor, ROSS has sufficiently alleged that public law databases and legal search tools may be two \ndifferent products instead of one. \nROSS has also plausibly alleged that there are independent markets for both products. \nThe amended counterclaims allege \"a growing interest in unbundled search products, or other \nflexible options for digital legal research.\" (D.I. 36 at 27 ,r 79) ROSS further alleges that \n\"there are relevant markets for public law database products and legal search technologies in the \nUnited States.\" (Id. at 27 ,r 80) The customers in those markets include \"end-users like law \nfirms, intermediate buyers like bar associations that seek to expand access to the law, and \n8 intermediate buyers like ROSS that need access to the database to develop, test and market their \nplatform products. \" (Id.) Indeed, ROSS alleges that its legal search tool received significant \nattention and praise from those types of customer s. (See, e.g., id. at 24 ,r 68; id. at 25 ,r 74) \nMoreover , investors put money into ROSS, \"suggesting that the venture capital community \nbelieved that there was demand for legal search tools.\" (D.I. 38 at 15) (citing D.I. 36 at 23-24 \n,r,r 65-67) \nIn the Court's view, ROSS has adequatel y and plausibly alleged separate product markets \nfor public law databases and legal search tools. See generally Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 486 \n( acknowledging that Kodak might be able to prove that parts, service, and equipment all \ncompose one market, but declining to reach that conclusion as matter of law on summary \njudgment); see also Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino s Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 436 (3d Cir. \n1997) (\"[I]n most cases, proper market definition can be determined only after a factual inquiry \ninto the commercial realities faced by consumer s.\"). \nThus, the Court will deny Plaintiffs ' motion to dismiss ROSS's \u00a7 2 tying claim. \n2. Sham Litigation \nROSS's second theory for its\u00a7 2 Sherman Act claim is that Plaintiffs have engaged in \nanticompetitive conduct by pursuing sham litigation. (D.I. 38 at 12) To prove \"sham \nlitigation,\" ROSS will have to show (i) a lawsuit that is \"objectively baseless in the sense that no \nreasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits\" and (ii) Plaintiffs brought the \nlawsuit with a subjective motivation to weaponize the litigation process for an anticompetitive \npurpose. Pro. Real Estate Invs., Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. (\"PRE''), 508 U.S. 49, \n60-61 (1993). \"The existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a \n9 finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation. \" Id at 62. \"A litigant has \nprobable cause to initiate a suit if the litigant has 'a reasonable belief that there is a chance that a \nclaim may be held valid upon adjudication .'\" In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig. Indirect \nPurchaser Class, 868 F.3d 132, 148 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting PRE:, 508 U.S. at 62-63). \nAccordingly , ROSS \"faces an uphill battle\" by \"claiming that a lawsuit is, by its very existence , \nanticompetitive and unlawful. \" Id. at 14 7. \nAs a preliminary matter, ROSS argues that Plaintiffs forfeited their challenge to the sham \nlitigation claim by failing to raise it in their opening brief. (D.I. 38 at 1) The Court disagrees. \nAs Plaintiffs persuasively explain , they \"moved to dismiss ROSS 's \u00a7 2 claim for failure to \nidentify any actionable exclusionary conduct,\" and \"there is no separate 'sham litigation' Count \nin the Counterclaims.\" (D.I. 45 at 6-7) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) The \nCourt does not fault Plaintiffs for failing to foresee every possible argument ROSS would make \nafter Plaintiffs made it clear they were seeking to dismiss the federal antitrust claims in their \nentirety. \nROSS has failed to plausibly allege that Plaintiffs have engaged in sham litigation. \nNotably, the amended counterclaims do not identify any specific litigation that was or is \npurportedly a sham. At the hearing, ROSS indicated that its sham litigation claim is supported \nby paragraphs 51-55 and 110-113 of the amended counterclaims. (Tr. at 47) Paragraphs 51-55 \nallege that Plaintiffs at one point asserted copyrights in Westlaw page numbers and have also \nasserted copyrights in Westlawheadnotes. (D.I. 36 at 19-20 ,r,r 51-55) Paragraphs 53 and 54 \ncite a decision in which the Second Circuit held that certain information regarding cases \npublished on Westlaw is not copyrightable. (Id. at 20 ,r,r 53-54) (citing Matthew Bender & Co. \n10 v. W Pub!. Co., 158 F.3d 674 (2d Cir. 1998)) Those paragraphs do not allege that the litigation \nwas a sham. ROSS does not allege that the suit was \"objectively baseless\" or that West had an \nimproper intent in pursuing it. \nParagraphs 110-113 of the amended counterclaims are similarly deficient. Paragraph \n110 primarily alleges that uncopyrightable government edicts are intermingled with Plaintiffs' \nproprietary information on Westlaw. (D.I. 36 at 341 110) The paragraph concludes with the \nvague suggestion that \"it is not difficult for [Plaintiffs] to find a way to sue [their] rivals,\" and \n\"on information and belief,\" Plaintiffs have \"a long practice of aggressively pursuing such \nclaims.\" (Id) Paragraph 110 does not list even one example that supposedly fits within this \n\"long practice.\" Paragraph 111 goes on to state that these unspecified litigations are \n\"objectively baseless\" and brought \"to force rivals into unnecessary expensive legal fights solely \nto raise entry barriers.\" (Id at 3 5 1 111) While these allegations track the legal requirements \nfor sham litigation, see PRE, 508 U.S. at 60-61, they are conclusory and deficient, see Schuylkill \nEnergy Res., 113 F.3d at 417. \nFinally, ROSS insinuates that the instant litigation is a sham. (See D.I. 36 at 35 11 112-\n13) The parties dispute whether the Court's earlier denial of ROSS's motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs' copyright and tortious interference claims means that, as a matter of law, this litigation \nis not a sham. (See Tr. at 46-47) Regardless, ROSS has not made any specific allegations \nabout how the instant case is a sham. Instead, after outlining its vague and conclusory \nallegations about Plaintiffs' \"long history\" of sham litigation, ROSS simply states that \"[t]his is \nexactly what happened to ROSS.\" (D.I. 36 at 35 1 112) \n11 ROSS has not plausibly alleged that Plaintiffs have engaged in sham litigation. \nAccordingly, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' motion with respect to ROSS's sham litigation \nclaim. See, e.g., 3Shape Trios AJS v. Align Tech., Inc., 2019 WL 3824209, at *5-6 (D. Del. Aug. \n15, 2019) (recommending that motion to dismiss be granted because plaintiff\"fail[ed] to \nplausibly allege sham litigation\"), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 4686614 (D. \nDel. Sept. 26, 2019). \nB. Sherman Act \u00a7 1 \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, prohibits \"every contract ... or conspiracy , \nin restraint of trade or commerce .\" To state a claim under\u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, one must \nallege (i) an agreement , contract, combination, or conspiracy, (ii) imposing an unreasonable \nrestraint of trade within a relevant market, and (iii) an accompanying antitrust injury. See In re \nIns. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 314-15, 315 n.9 (3d Cir. 2010). \nLike ROSS 's \u00a7 2 claim, ROSS 's \u00a7 1 claim is based on a tying theory. A tying \narrangement \"violates \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act if the seller has appreciable economic power in the \ntying product market and if the arrangement affects a substantial volume of commerce in the tied \nmarket.\" Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 462 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, ROSS alleges that Plaintiffs use their market power for public law databases to \nprotect their legal search engine model. (Tr. at 35) Given the similarities between the \u00a7 1 claim \nand the \u00a7 2 claim, Plaintiffs principally argue that ROSS 's \u00a7 1 claim fails for the same reasons \nthat its \u00a7 2 claim fails. (D.I. 45 at 6 n. l; Tr. at 53) This argument fails, for all the reasons it \nfailed in connection with the \u00a7 2 tying claim, as discussed above. \n12 Plaintiffs advance another reason why the \u00a7 1 tying claim should be dismissed: in \nPlaintiffs ' view, ROSS has not alleged any agreement , contract, or conspiracy between one of the \nPlaintiffs and another party, as is required for a\u00a7 1 claim. (D.I. 28 at 15-16; D.I. 45 at 8-9) \nROSS points to Plaintiffs ' agreements with their customers as the relevant contracts. (D.I. 38 at \n12) ROSS alleges that Plaintiffs use \"restrictive licensing conditions to foreclose rivals from \naccess to the relevant markets.\" (D.I. 36 at 31 ,r 102) For instance, subsection l(a) of the \n\"Research Subscriber Agreement \" between Plaintiffs and their customers defines \"Data\" to \ninclude \"all information and representations of information , including but not limited to, \ngraphical representations , and other content made available to [users] through the Product.\" (Id. \nat 32 ,r 103) According to ROSS, this contract term \"does not permit customers to unbundle \n[Plaintiffs'] two products.\" (D.I. 38 at 12) In other words, by entering into the customer \nagreements , Plaintiffs protect their content from being shared with competitors such as ROSS. \n(See Tr. at 40) \nPlaintiffs argue that the customer agreements really involve unilateral action, as \nevidenced by the fact that ROSS refers to those agreements as \"contracts of adhesion.\" (D.I. 45 \nat 8-9) This is not dispositive . In Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 47, the United States and individual \nstates sued Microsoft for violations of the Sherman Act due to \"anticompetitive terms in its \nlicensing and software developer agreements. \" One of the claims was a \u00a7 1 tying claim based \non the bundling of the Internet Explorer web browser with the Windows operating system. Id. \nIn stating the elements of a per se tying violation, the D.C. Circuit did not mention the existence \nof an agreement or conspiracy. Id. at 85. Even if such an agreement or conspiracy is a \n13 necessary element, the D.C. Circuit appears to have assumed that the licensing and software \ndeveloper agreements were sufficient. \nPlaintiffs attempt to brush Microsoft aside by casting it as an \"exclusive dealing\" case. \n(See Tr. at 52) According to Plaintiffs , an exclusive dealing case is different because \"both sides \nof the contract get stuff they want.\" (Id.) Plaintiffs ' contention ignores that their customers \n\"get stuff they want\" by entering into Research Subscriber Agreements -specifically , they get \naccess to Plaintiffs ' comprehensive public law database and valuable legal search tool. (See id. \nat 57-58) Accordingly , the Court agrees with ROSS that Microsoft provides some support for \nits \u00a7 1 tying theory. \nTo further support its \u00a7 1 tying claim, ROSS also relies on Allen-My/and , Inc. v. \nInternational Business Machines Corp., 33 F.3d 194 (3d Cir. 1994). (See D.I. 38 at 12-13) \nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish that case in a footnote with one sentence: \"Allen-My/and is a\u00a7 1 \ntying case; ROSS's tying theory fails for the reasons stated previously .\" (D.I. 45 at 9 n.4) \nGiven the Court's decision that ROSS 's \u00a7 2 tying theory does not fail as a matter of law, \nPlaintiffs ' distinction is unpersuasive . Indeed, the facts of Allen-My/and (as with those of \nMicrosoft) lend some support to ROSS's \u00a7 1 tying claim. In Allen-My/and , 33 F.3d at 199, the \nplaintiff challenged IBM's \"net pricing\" policy, under which \"IBM installation labor was \nbundled in with the price of the parts\" for upgrading IBM mainframe computers. The plaintiff \nbrought a \u00a7 1 tying claim based on the bundling of the labor and parts. After a bench trial, the \ndistrict court ruled in the plaintiff's favor. See id. at 199-200. In reviewing \u00a7 1 tying law, the \nThird Circuit implied that some kind of \"contractual arrangement \" is necessary . See id. at 201. \nThere appears to have been no dispute, however, that IBM's agreements implementing the \"net \n14 pricing\" policy met any such requirement. ROSS alleges that Plaintiffs and their customers \nenter into Research Subscriber Agreements, which appear to be similar to the agreements in \nAllen-Myland. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss ROSS's \u00a7 1 tying claim. \nII. State Law Counterclaims \nA. California Unfair Competition Law \nROSS's counterclaim under California unfair competition law depends in part on federal \nantitrust law. (D.I. 36 at 44 ,r 173) (\"[Plaintiffs'] conduct is unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent \nbecause it is in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and also in violation of the \npolicy or spirit of the Sherman Act.\") Plaintiffs admit that ROSS's California claim \"rises or \nfalls\" with the federal antitrust claims. (Tr. at 26-27) Because ROSS will be permitted to \npursue its \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 2 claims, as discussed above, the Court will deny Plaintiffs' motion with \nrespect to the California claim. 5 \nB. Delaware Common Law On Unfair Competition \nThe final count in the amended counterclaims alleges that Plaintiffs have violated \nDelaware common law on unfair competition. (D.I. 36 at 45 ,r,r 176-80) Under Delaware law, \n\"the elements of the tort of unfair competition are that the plaintiff has a reasonable expectancy \nof entering a valid business relationship, with which the defendant wrongfully interferes, and \nthereby defeats the plaintiff's legitimate expectancy and causes [it] harm.\" Accenture Glob. \nServs. GmbH v. Guidewire Software Inc., 581 F. Supp. 2d 654, 656-66 (D. Del. 2008) (internal \n5 The Court need not and does not reach the issue of whether ROSS 's allegations of \ncopyright misuse would be sufficient to prevent the dismissal of Count VIII if the Court were to \ndismiss the federal antitrust claims. (See D.I. 38 at 19) \n15 quotation marks omitted); see also Rypac Packaging Mach. Inc. v. Coakley, 2000 WL 567895, at \n* 8 (Del. Ch. May 1, 2000). \nROSS alleges that it \"had a business expectancy to sell its legal search platform product \nin the market, having received ... indications from customers that they would purchase access to \nthe ROSS platform once it was tied to a reliable database. \" (D.I. 36 at 45 ,r 177) ROSS does \nnot identify or even allude to any specific party with whom it reasonably expected to enter into a \nvalid business relationship. (See Tr. at 49) (ROSS admitting that it did \"not allege [loss of] a \nspecific customer,\" just loss of \"business opportunities \") Although identifying a specific party \nby name is not necessary, ROSS still must \"plead facts to allow the court to 'reasonably infer that \nspecific parties were involved.\"' You Map, Inc. v. Snap Inc., 2021 WL 106498, at *9 (D. Del. \nJan. 12, 2021) (quoting Agilent Techs., Inc. v. Kirkland , 2009 WL 119865, at *7 (Del. Ch. Jan. \n20, 2009)), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 WL 327388 (D. Del. Feb. 1, 2021). \nROSS has not pied any facts that allow the Court to draw such an inference. \nROSS initially pointed to allegations regarding multiple antitrust theories as support for \nits Delaware law claim. (See D.I. 38 at 20) At the hearing, however, ROSS clarified that its \nallegations of sham litigation are the sole support for this claim. (See Tr. at 49) In fact, ROSS \nconceded that dismissal of the sham litigation claim under \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act would warrant \ndismissal of the claim under Delaware unfair competition law. (Id. at 50) Because the Court \nwill dismiss ROSS 's sham litigation claim, the Court will also dismiss Count IX. \nIII. Amendment \nROSS asks for an opportunity to amend in order to correct any deficiencies identified in \nthe Court's decision on Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss. (D.I. 38 at 20; Tr. at 59) At this point, the \n16 Court lacks a record from which it could conclude that amendment would be futile or otherwise \nimproper. See generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). Accordingl y, ROSS may file amended \ncounterclaims, provided that it does so no later than May 20, 2022. The Court's grant of leave \nto amend is without prejudice to Plaintiffs ' having an opportunity to move to dismiss any \namended counterclaims. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs ' renewed motion to dismiss ROSS's antitrust and \nunfair competition counterclaims (D.I. 39) will be granted in part and denied in part. An \nappropriate order follows. \n17 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nTHOMSON REUTERS ENTERPRISE CENTRE \nGMBH and WEST PUBLISHING \nCORPORATION , \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nROSS INTELLIGENCE INC., \nDefendant.
