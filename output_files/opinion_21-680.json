No. 21-680 (GBW)\n)\nCENTURION OF DELAWARE, )\nLLC, )\n)\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 0\" Yay of February, 2023, having considered\nPlaintiff's request for appointed counsel (D.I. 12), and Defendant\u2019s motion to\ndismiss (D.I. 13);\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: (1) Plaintiff's request for appointed\ncounsel (D.I. 12) is DENIED without prejudice to renew, and (2) Defendant\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss (D.I. 13) is DENIED.\n\nMotion to Dismiss. Plaintiff Phillip M. Smith proceeds pro se and has been\ngranted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 6). On March 1, 2022, the Court\nscreened the Complaint, identified what appeared to be cognizable and non-\nfrivolous claims within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), and entered a\n\nservice order. (D.I. 8).\nThe legal standard used when screening cases for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal standard. See\nMalcomb v. McKean, 535 F. App\u2019x 184, 186 (3d Cir. 2013) (citing De \u2018lonta v.\nJohnson, 708 F.3d 520, 524 (4th Cir. 2013), and Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220,\n223 (3d Cir. 2000)). Nothing has changed since the Complaint was screened. In\naddition, the Court must liberally construe the Complaint. See Erickson v. Pardus,\n551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). In doing so, the Court concludes that the allegations\ncontained in the Complaint are sufficient to withstand the instant motion to dismiss\nand, therefore, denies the motion.\n\nRequest for Counsel. Plaintiff requests counsel on the grounds that he is\nunable to afford counsel, he has been unsuccessful in attempts to obtain counsel,\nhis imprisonment greatly limits his ability to litigate the case, the issues involved\nare complex, he has limited access to the law library and limited legal knowledge,\nand counsel will be better suited to present evidence and cross examine witnesses.\n\nA pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or\nstatutory right to representation by counsel. See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d\n187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).\nHowever, representation by counsel may be appropriate under certain\ncircumstances, after a finding that a plaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and\n\nlaw. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, courts should consider a number of\nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court\nin deciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include:\n(1) the merits of the plaintiff's claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her\ncase considering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed\nupon him or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the\ndegree to which factual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue\nsuch investigation; (5) the plaintiff's capacity to retain counsel on his or her own\nbehalf; and (6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or\nexpert testimony. See Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir.\n2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155-56. The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor\ndeterminative. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.\n\nAssuming, solely for the purpose of deciding this motion, that Plaintiff's\nclaims have merit in fact and law, several of the Tabron factors militate against\ngranting his request for counsel at this time. Based on a review of the Complaint\nand Plaintiff's response to the motion to dismiss, the Court concludes that the case\nis not complex, and that Plaintiff appears to have the ability to present his claims.\n\nIn addition, this case is still in its early stages.\nThe Honorable Gregory B. Williams\nUnited States District Judge\n"}
