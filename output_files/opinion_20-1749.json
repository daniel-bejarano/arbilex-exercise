Appellants are holders of general unsecured litigation \nclaims against the debtor Tonopah Solar Energy, LLC  (\u201cTonopah \u201d or \u201c Debtor \u201d) which claims are \nunimpaired under the terms of the confirmed plan .  Seeking  to reverse the Confirmat ion Order , and \npresumably overturn the plan in toto , Appellant s raise five issues  on appeal.  ( See D.I. 19 at 2).  \nTonopah has moved to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the appeal is e quitably moot  (see D.I. 16 \nat 15-24) (\u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d) , or, in the alternative, if the appeal is not dismissed, Tonopah moves \nto strike  two issues designated by Appellants on the basis that Appellants lack appellate standing to \nraise them (see id. at 24- 27) (\u201cMotion to Strike\u201d) .  For the reasons set forth herein, the Court will \ngrant the Motion to Strike, affirm the Confirmation Order , and deny the Motion to Dismiss as moot.    \nI. BACKGROUND \n \nA. The Debtor  \nTonopah owns and operates a net 110- megawatt concentrated solar energy power plant \n(\u201cPlant\u201d) located near Tonopah in Nye County, Nevada.  (See MTD0202- 0368 (\u201c Disclosure  \nStatement \u201d) at MTD0 218).  The Plant, also known as the Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project  \n \n1  The docket of the chapter 11 cases, captioned In re Tonopah Solar Energy , LLC , Case No.  \n20-11884 (KBO) (Bankr. D. Del.) , is cited herein as \u201cB.D.I. __.\u201d  The appendix (D.I. 18) \nfiled in support of the Debtor\u2019s  Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 16)  is cited herein a s \u201cMTD__.\u201d   \nThe appendix (D.I. 21) filed in support of Debtor\u2019s answering brief on the merits (D.I. 20) \nis cited herein as \u201cA __.\u201d 2 (\u201cProject\u201d), was to be the first utility -scale solar project of its kind in the U.S. to store energy as heat \nin the form of molten salt, effectively functioning as a  giant battery with the capability to generate \nelectricity at night.  (Id.).  The development of the Project depended on identifying a construction \ncompany that would assume the risks associated with the required engineering, procurement, and \nconstruction contract.  (MTD0219) .  In December 2009, Tonopah executed a contract ( as amend ed, \n\u201cEPC Contract\u201d) with Cobra Thermosolar  Plants, Inc. (\u201cCPI\u201d) to provide engineering, procurement, \nand construction services in connection with the Project.  (Id.).  As the result of certain amendments \nto the EPC Contract, CPI was required to maintain standby letters of credit ( \u201cEPC Letters of Credit\u201d) \nthat Tonopah could draw upon to the extent certain operating and other expenses were not paid by \nCPI in accordance with the terms of the EPC Contract.  ( D.I. 17 (\u201c Pugh Appeal Decl .\u201d) \u00b6 7(v iii)). \n The Project was funded through equity investments from an affiliate of  SolarReserve, Cobra \nEnergy Investments, LLC (\u201cCEI\u201d), which is an affiliate of ACS Servicios  Comunicaciones y \nEnerg\u00eda S.L. (\u201cACS\u201d and, together with CEI and CPI, \u201cCobra\u201d), and Banco Santande r, S.A. (\u201cBanco \nSantander\u201d).  (MTD0219) .  In addition, Tonopah and the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) \nentered into a  Loan Guarantee Agreement , dated September 23, 2011 ( \u201cLGA\u201d), whereby the DOE \nguaranteed a project loan made to Tonopah by the Federal Financing Bank ( \u201cDOE Loan\u201d).  (Id.).  \nIn connection with its obligations under the LGA, SolarReserve obtained $90 million in financing \nfrom CMB Group  IX, which loan was memorialized in the \u201cGroup IX Loan Agreement.\u201d   \n(MTD0071) .  Tonopah is  not a party to the CMB Group IX Loan Agreement.  ( Id.). \n The DOE Loan was secured by substantially all of Tonopah\u2019s assets, including the  Project, \nTonopah\u2019s rights under its major contracts (including the EPC Contract), and all cash maintained in \nthe DOE -controlled accounts.  ( MTD0224).  PNC Bank, National Association d/b/a Midland Loan \nServices served as  collateral agent  (\u201cPrepetition Collateral Agent\u201d)  in connection with the PPA \n(defined below) (MTD0220) .  As of the petition date, the approximate pri ncipal amount of the DOE 3 Loan was  $425 million , and the accrued and unpaid interest under the DOE Loan was approximately \n$7.4 million.  ( MTD0224) . \nAs of the p etition date, all of the equity interests in Tonopah were owned by nondebtor  \nTonopah Solar Energy Holdings II, LLC (\u201cTSEH II\u201d).  ( MTD0226) .  The equity interests  in TSEH \nII were divided into two classes: Class A Units held solely by Capital One as a tax equity  investor \nand Class B Units owned by non- debtor Tonopah Solar Energy Holdings I, LLC (\u201cTSEH  I\u201d).  (Id.).  \nTSEH I was owned indirectly by Banco Santander (26.8%) and directly by non- debtor  Tonopah \nSolar Investments, LLC (73.2%) (\u201cTSI LLC\u201d).  ( Id.).  CEI and SolarReserve each held 50%  of TSI \nLLC.  (Id.).  Therefore, both CEI and SolarReserve were thrice removed remote, indirect owners  of \nTonopah, but neither was the holder of an equity interest directly in Tonopah. \nNeither of the Appellants  are equity holders of Tonopah.  SolarReserve\u2019s equity ownership \nis positioned several layer s up Tonopah\u2019s organizational chain \u2013 SolarReserve is an equity holder \nof TSI LLC, which is an equity holder of TSEH I.  (MTD0224) .  TSEH I, in turn, is an equity holder \nof TSEH II, Tonopah\u2019s parent company.  (Id.).  CMB is a lender to SolarReserve, not To nopah, and \nhas received an assignment of certain claims asserted by SolarReserve.  ( See MTD0049- 54, 97).  \nB. Events Leading to Chapter 11 Filing  \nTonopah commenced commercial operations and production at the Plant in November 2015.  \n(MTD0220) .  The electricity generated by the Plant was sold exclusively to the Nevada Power \nCompany, d/b/a NV Energy (\u201cNVE\u201d) under a long- term power purchase agreement ( \u201cPPA\u201d).  \n(MTD0218) .  In late March 2019, the Plant\u2019s hot salt tank \u2013 an essential component in the  operation \nof the Plant  \u2013 experienced a leak, which required Tonopah to halt all power  generating  operations \nat the Plant in early April 2019.  (MTD0222) .  Although CPI commenced repairs to the tank, the \nPlant was unable to produce any electricity beginning in April 2019, also ending Tonopah\u2019s  ability \nto generate revenue through the  sale of power.  (Id.).  In September 2019, DOE sent Tonopah a 4 Notice of Events  of Default alleging that Tonopah was in default under several  provisions of the \nLGA.  (Id.).  NVE terminated the PPA in October 2019.  (MTD0226) .  In early 2020, facing liquidity \nissues, Tonopah, Cobra, and the DOE began discussions regarding the compromise and settlement \nof the DOE\u2019s claims for an agreed -upon reduced amount.  (MTD0227) .  Ultimately, following \nmonths of extensive arm\u2019s  length negotiations, Tonopah, Cobra, and DOE agreed in principle to the \nterms of  a de-leveraging transaction through a pre -negotiated chapter 11 plan that also involved the  \nsettlement of an arbitration proceeding commenced under the Rules of Arbitration of the  \nInternational Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in which CSI and  \nTonopah asserted substantial claims against each other relating to the EPC Contract ( \u201cICC  \nArbitration\u201d).   (Id.). \nOn July 29, 2020, Tonopah and Cobra entered into a  Restructuring Support Agreement \n(\u201cRSA\u201d), which provided that: (a) DOE would receive, in ful l and  complete satisfaction of \nTonopah\u2019s outstanding obligations under the L oan Documents (as defined  in the LGA), a payment \nof $200 million in cash upon the effective date of the Plan, plus a $100 million contingent note to \nbe guaranteed by Cobra, with Cobra funding Tonopah\u2019s obligations  under the Plan through new \ndebt financing and cash to be provided on the effective date of the  Plan; (b) the security interests \ngranted under the Security Documents (as defined in the LGA) would be released; (c) the parties \nwould enter into mutual, consensual releases of all  claims against each other on the terms set forth \nin the Plan; (d) Cobra or an affiliate thereof would own 100% of Tonopah upon completion of the \nrestructuring; and (e) all other claims would  remain unimpaired as set forth in the Plan.  ( Id.). \nC. Chapter 11 Case  \n \nOn July 30, 2020 (\u201cPetition Date\u201d), Tonopah commenced a  voluntary case  under chapter 11 \nthe Bankruptcy Code.  The same day, Tonopah filed a proposed plan (MTD0145- 201) (as amended  \n\u201cPlan\u201d) , which embodied the terms of the RSA, along with  a related disclosure statement 5 (MTD0202- 368).  Despite their tenuous connection to Tonopah, Appellants filed objections to \nvarious  requests for relief filed  by Tonopah, including to Tonopah\u2019s  consensual use of cash \ncollateral and approval of its  Disclosure Statement (both of which were  overruled by the Bankruptcy \nCourt), and also served multiple and voluminous discovery requests on Tonopah.  ( See B.D.I. 85 & \n133).  Appellants\u2019 standing to participate in the chapter 11 case was challenged by Tonopah and \nquestioned by the Bankruptcy Court throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.  (See, e.g., \nMTD00013- 36) (\u201c8/24/20 Tr.\u201d)  at 20:3- 7 (\u201cSolar Reserve\u2019s . . . standing . . . to be heard in \nconnection with this matter seems  to be questionable at best[.]\u201d); MTD0369- 0412 (\u201c9/4/20 Tr.\u201d)  at \n39:3- 5 (\u201c[Appellants] don\u2019t have standing to object to the disclosure statement in their capacity as \na remote investor and non- voting part y[.].\u201d).  \nDespite the fact that no bar date was set  for proofs of claim  \u2013 as all creditors with the \nexception of DOE  were unimpaired under the proposed plan \u2013 Appellants still filed proof s of claim  \nin the chapter 11 case.  According to Tonopah, Appellants filed these proofs of claims to \u201cmanufacture standing.\u201d   (D.I. 16 at 23).  CMB\u2019s proofs of claim asserted a general unsecured claim \nagainst Tonopah in the amount of $90 million based upon a complaint (as amended, \u201cNevada \nComplaint\u201d) filed months  before Tonopah\u2019s chapter 11 filing on  May 19, 2020 in Nevada state court \nagainst Cobra, certain Cobra  affiliates, and Tonopah, among others (\u201cNevada Action\u201d).  (See \nMTD0224- 25).  The  amended Nevada C omplaint filed on September 1, 2020 (MTD0058- 94) \nfocuses on claims against Cobra  and alleges  that the Project was \u201cplagued by repeated failures by \n[CPI]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Project\u2019s failure is due almost entirely to [Cobra].\u201d  (MTD0059- 60).  For its \npart, SolarReserve\u2019s proof of claim asserted a general unsecured claim against Tonopah asserting \nunliquidated monetary damages based upon a nonmonetary action filed by SolarReserve against \nTonopah in the Delaware Court of Chancery on February 5, 2020, seeking to enforce its alleged \ncontractual right to inspect Tonopah\u2019s books and records .  (MTD0422 -29).  Prior to Tonopah\u2019s 6 bankruptcy filing, however, after a one- day bench trial, the Court of Chancery resolved the a ction \nin Tonopah\u2019s favor, holding that  SolarReserve could not enforce its purported inspection rights \nbecause (a) it had assigned all  claims it had against Tonopah to CMB, and (b) Tonopah\u2019s operating \nagreement expressly denied  information rights to \u201cunaffiliated successors\u201d such as CMB.  \nSolarReserve CSP Holdings, LLC v. Tonopah Solar Energy, LLC , 2020 WL 4251968, at *5- 6 (Del. \nCh. July 24, 2020).  The decision was on appeal at time of the confirmation hearing .2   \n On October 1, 2020, Tonopah filed its objection to Appellants\u2019 proofs of claim ( MTD0430-\n519) (\u201cClaim Objection\u201d) seeking entry of  an order (a) determining that CMB and SolarReserve \nlacked standing in the chapter 11 c ase and  (b) disallowing the proofs of claim for lack of standing \nand failure to state a claim against  Tonopah.  The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Claim \nObjection (MTD0520- 0542) (\u201c10/27/20 Tr.\u201d) , at which time Appellants argued that they possessed \nstanding \u201cto participate in all aspects\u201d of the c hapter 11 c ase.  (Id. at 6:1).  The Bankruptcy Court \nnoted that neither CMB nor SolarReserve held a direct interest in  Tonopah and that, as a result, \n\u201cthey are too far removed to participate in this case as parties in  interest based on that ownership \nthrice r emoved or even more removed.\u201d  ( Id. at 8:24 -9:4).  Bankruptcy judge, the Honorable Karen  \nB. Owens , noted that Appellants lacked  Article III standing to object to portions of the Plan that did \nnot affect their direct interest, such as the release provisions, valuation, and satisfaction of the \nabsolute priority rule, because they were \u201cunimpaired under the plan[.]\u201d  (Id. at 8:24- 10:5) .  The \nBankruptcy Court went on to emphasize that Appellants\u2019 standing was extremely limited and that, \nas a result, any Plan  objections must be limited:  \n \n2  The Delaware Supreme Court later dismissed the appeal as moot.  SolarReserve CSP \nHoldings, LLC v. Tonopah Solar Energy, LLC , 258 A.3d 806 (Del. Aug. 9, 2021).  As t he \nchapter 11 proceeding resulted in Tonopah \u2019s reorganization, along with a new LLC \nAgreement that eliminated the inspection provision at issue, the parties agreed that the relief \nin the underlying books and records action could not be granted.  Id . at *1. 7 So based on their unimpaired status no matter what their general \nunsecured claims are, there is no in jury under this plan to Appellants \nas claimholders that I can address based on the absolute priority rule or valuation argument. . . . I can\u2019t envision many other meaningful \nobjections that Appellants can raise to the plan. But if those \nobjections are rais ed, I think that they\u2019re going to be extremely \nlimited.  \n \n(Id. at 10:1- 22; see also id. 20:19- 21, 22:20- 23 (permitting \u201climited discovery\u201d  concerning \nfeasibility  but not valuation) ). \nD. Plan Confirmation  \n \nOn November 6, 2020, Appellants filed an objection to plan confirmation  (MTD0543- 564) \n(\u201cConfirmation Objection\u201d)  which  argued that: (i) the Plan did not meet the feasibility requirement \nof \u00a7 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code; (ii) notwithstanding the expr ess terms of the Plan, \nunsecured creditors were impaired under the Plan and therefore entitled to vote; (iii) the Plan was \nnot proposed in good faith as required by \u00a7  1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code; (iv) the Plan did not \nsatisfy \u00a7 1129(a)(7)\u2019s best inte rests test as creditors would fare better under a liquidation of \nTonopah; (v) the Plan releases and exculpation were overbroad; and (vi) Tonopah failed to identify contracts it sought to assume.  Given the court\u2019s prior ruling, a  dispute arose regarding the scope of \nexpert witness testimony.  (MTD 0565- 0612 (\u201c11/16/20 Tr.\u201d)  at 3:8-17).  Based on their status as \nunimpaired, unsecured creditors, Tonopah argued that Appellants lacked standing to challenge the \nreasonableness of the settlement embodied in the Plan, as well as whether the Plan  satisfied the best \ninterests of creditors test, was proposed in good faith, and include d releases that  were overbroad, as \nthose aspects of the Plan did not impact Appellants\u2019 treatment and ultimate  recovery and/or were \nnot applicable to the Plan based upon the class structure thereof.  (Id. at 9:20- 12:11) .  Tonopah \ntherefore requested that t he Bankruptcy Court limit the scope of Appellants\u2019 expert testimony to \nplan feasibility.  (Id. at 12:12- 21).  The Bankruptcy Court agreed with Tonopah, ruling that \nAppellants\u2019 expert testimony must be limited to  feasibility and that Appellants needed to \u201cb e careful 8 that [such testimony] did not stray into other topics  . . . such as challenges to the releases\u201d given that \nAppellants were not impaired under the Plan:    \n\u201c[T]he idea that you\u2019re impaired, I\u2019m just going to tell you right \nnow, you\u2019re not  impaired under the plan.  The plan says that your \nclaim is just flowing through.  So, to me, your  objection is whether \nthe plan is going to be able to satisfy your claim if it is ultimately \nallowed . . . So, that\u2019s a feasibility objection ; that\u2019s not an \nimpairment objection . \n \n(Id. at 18:5- 11; see also  37:4- 25; 38:1- 7). \nOn November 20, 2020 (MTD0613- 0832) (\u201c11/20/20 Tr.\u201d) and December 3, 2020 \n(MTD0833- 0932) (\u201c12/3/20 Tr.\u201d), t he Bankruptcy Court held a two- day hearing (\u201cConfirmation \nHearing\u201d).  Tonopah and Appellants  presented testimony regarding plan  feasibility.  In addition, as \nthe result of mediation sessions conducted by the  Honorable Brendan L. Shannon at Judge Owens\u2019 \nsuggestion, Tonopah and Cobra presented enhancements to the Plan made for the benefit of \nAppellan ts: Cobra agreed to (i) provide a $6 million irrevocable letter of credit (\u201cCMB/SR Letter of \nCredit\u201d) in favor of Appellants as a reserve to be drawn on in the ev ent that Appellants obtain a \nfinal, non- appealable judgment against  Tonopah and Tonopah fails to pay that judgment , and \n(ii) increase the Working Capital Facility  (defined below) by $14 million.  (See 12/3/ 20 Tr. at 6:18-\n25; 7:1- 21).  The Bankruptcy Court ruled that the record supported a finding that the P lan was \nfeasible, particularly in light of the CMB/SR Letter of Credit and  increase to the Working Capital \nFacility, and the Plan satisfied each of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s  confirmation standards.  (See id. at \n93:9- 15).  The Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order on December 9, 2020.  On \nDecember 18, 2020, the Plan became  effective and Tonopah emerged from chapter 11.  (MTD1090-\n92). 9 On December 23, 2020, Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal of the Confirmation Order .  \n(D.I. 1).  On April 12, 2021, Debtor filed its Motion to Dismiss and Strike, which has been fully \nbriefed.  (D.I. 15- 18, 23, 26- 28).  T he merits of the  appeal are fully briefed.  (D.I. 19, 20, 25).   \nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nThe Court has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a final judgment of the bankruptcy court \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). The Confirmation Order is a final, appealable order.   The \nBankruptcy Court\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed de novo , its factual findings for clear error, and \nits exercises of discretion for abuse.  See In re Michael , 699 F.3d 305, 308 n.2 (3d Cir. 2012).  The \nparties agree that this Court reviews the Bankr uptcy Court\u2019s feasibility finding for clear error.  See \nIn re Coastal Broad. Sys., Inc., 570 F. App\u2019x. 188, 193 (3d Cir. 2014).  The District Court shall not \nreverse a feasibility finding unless the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s factual findings are \u201ccompletely devoi d \nof a credible evidentiary basis or bear[ ] no rational relationship to the supporting data[.]\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Shire U.S., Inc. v. Bar Labs., Inc ., 329 F.3d 348, 353 (3d Cir. 2003) ).  Finally, the Court \nreviews evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.  See U.S. v.  Console , 13 F.3d 641, 656 (3d Cir. \n1993); see also In re Trans World Airlines , 1996 WL 756962, at *2 (D. Del. Dec. 31, 1996) (\u201cAs \ndecisions by a bankruptcy court regarding the scope of evidence to be considered and the \nmanagement of discovery are discretionary, such decisions can only be overruled if they constitute \nan abuse of discretion.\u201d).  Even if the Bankruptcy Court erred by admitting evidence, the appellant must demo nstrate that admitting such evidence was  prejudicial to warrant reversal.  See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 61; F ed. R. B ankr. P. 9005. \nIII. PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS  \n Appellants argue that the  bankruptcy court erred in (1) finding that the Plan is feasible as \nrequired by \u00a7 1129(a)(11); (2) permitting the hearsay testimony of Justin Pugh regarding Plan \nfeasibility ; (3) permitting the testimony of Justin Pugh regarding Plan feasibility when Mr. Pugh 10 was not qualified as an expert witness ; (4) finding that the Debtor satisfied  its evidentiary burden of \nproof for confirmation of the Plan under \u00a7\u00a7 1129 (a) and (b) ; and ( 5) in finding that the Plan was \nproposed in good faith as required by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(3) . \nAppellants contend that they are \u201csignificant creditors and indirect equity holders of Debtor\u201d \nwho were left out of Debtor\u2019s plan negotiations and will be impaired under the Plan.  ( D.I. 19 at  9).  \nAccording to Appellants, Cobra is the \u201cthe primary party responsible for Debtor\u2019s failures ,\u201d and yet , \nthrough the Plan, which represents  a \u201ccollusive effort between \u201c Cobra, Debtor, DOE , and others ,\u201d \nCobra will  not only be \u201cgifted a 100% interest in reorganized Debtor ,\u201d Cobra  will also receive  a \nrelease, through the Plan\u2019s \u201coverbroad and impermissible releases ,\u201d from \u201cenormous liabilities \nassociated with [Cobra\u2019s] bad faith, willful misconduct, and gross negligence in constructing the \nPower Plant\u201d including estate claims \u201c worth more than $1 billion.\u201d  ( Id. at 9-10).   \nAppellants further assert  that, contrary to Debtor\u2019s assertions, the Plan will impair  their \nclaims .  (Id. at 10).  \u201c[ U]nder the Plan, the Debtor will not have sufficient reserves to pay Appellants\u2019 \nclaims in excess of $90 million once Appellants prevail on such claims ,\u201d as the Debtor\u2019s \u201c financial \nprojections conclusively establish Debtor\u2019s inability to pay such claims. \u201d  (Id. at 13).  According to \nAppellants, the c ourt\u2019s finding that the Plan is feasible  is unsupported by credible and admissible \nevidence, including tha t: (a) there will be sufficient funds to pay creditors in full; (b) the Plant repairs \nwill be successful; (c) Debtor has sufficient working capital facility to operate for approximately \n3 years even if operations never resume; and (d) it is unreasonable for  feasibility purposes to assume \nAppellants have  a $90 million claim against Debtor.   (Id. at 10- 24).  Appellants further assert that \nthe Debtor did not propose the plan in good faith.  (Id. at 12- 13; 25- 26). \nDebtor contends this  appeal is simply another ta ctic in Appellants\u2019 litigation campaign \nstemming from Appellants\u2019 dissatisfaction with  Cobra, SolarReserve\u2019s joint venture partner, and \nthe value of SolarReserve\u2019s remote and indirect investment in Tonopah.  (D.I. 16 at 3).  The Plan 11 does not impair Appell ants\u2019 rights in any manner, Debtor argues : \u201cAt most, Appellants hold \ncontingent, unliquidated general unsecured claims against Tonopah, based on highly disputed and \nspeculative litigation claims, which are unimpaired under the Plan in any case.\u201d   (Id.). \nDebtor argues that the appeal should be dismissed as equitably moot.  According to Debtor, \nthe RSA and  Plan followed months of extensive negotiations among Tonopah, DOE, the  DOJ, and \nCobra, and reflects a comprehensive settlement  of complex claims and litigation, including DOE\u2019s \nclaims under the $432 million DOE Loan as well as costly litigation  between Tonopah and Cobra \nwhich would have continued for years .  Appellants failed to seek a stay of the Confirmation Order, \nand the Plan has been substantially consummated .  Among the many interrelated transactions \ncontemplated by the Plan:  Tonopah has consummated significant exit financing facilities, made Plan \ndistributions, and engage d vendors to repair the  Plant; the $432 million in secured debt owed to  \nDOE has been satisfied by a $200 million cash payment funded by Cobra and through a new $100 \nmillion contingent note issued by Tonopah and guaranteed by Cobra ; DOE has released its liens and \nsecurity interests agains t the Plant; the consensual releases set forth in the Plan have been granted , \nand the ICC Arbitration has been dismissed with prejudice.  (Id. at 15 -18).  The appeal threatens to \nfatally scramble the Plan, and Appellants suggest no remedy separate from rev ersing the \nConfirmation Order in its entirety .  (Id. at 18- 22).  In such an event, the  comprehensive restructuring \nwould be undone, Debtor asserts, and  Tonopah could be forced to liquidate through chapter 7, in \nwhich case recoveries to  all creditors  would be significantly reduced.  Under these circumstances, \nDebtor  argues , it is clear that the a ppeal  is equitably moot  and should be dismissed.   \nShould the Court reach the merits of the appeal, Debtor asserts, the first three issues \nidentified  by Appellants center on the narrow question of whether the Bankruptcy Court  committed \nclear error in determining that the Plan was feasible.  Contrary to Appellants\u2019 premise  \u2013 that the \nBankruptcy Court\u2019s feasibility determination depended exclusively on the testimony of Tonopah 12 witness Justin Pugh, whom they term \u201ca single, one -stop- shop for all testimony supporting \nfeasibility\u201d ( see D.I. 19 at 12)  \u2013 Debtor asserts that  the record supporting the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \nfeasibility fin ding is overwhelming, and the Confirmation Order should be affirmed.  With respect \nto the remaining issues on appeal, Debtor asserts that Appellants do not have standing to raise \u201c Issue \n4\u201d (whether the c ourt erred in finding that Tonopah satisfied its burden of proof for confirmation of \nthe Plan under \u00a7\u00a7 1129(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code ), or \u201cIssue 5 \u201d (whether the c ourt erred in \nfinding that the Plan was proposed in good faith as required by \u00a7 1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy \nCode ).  Accordingly, t he Debtor as ks this Court to strike those issues.  (D.I. 16 at 24- 28). \nIV. MOTION TO STRIKE  (ISSUES 4 & 5)  \nAppellants assert that the Bankruptcy Court erred in finding that the Debtor satisfied its \nevidentiary burden of proof for confirmation of the Plan under \u00a7\u00a7 1129 (a) and (b) (Issue 4) and \nspecifically that the Bankruptcy Court erred in finding that Plan was proposed in good faith under \n\u00a7 1129(a)(3) (Issue 5).  Debtor argues that, with the exception of plan feasibility, Appellants lacked appellate standing to appeal these issues.  The Court agrees  with the Debtor . \nA. Plan Confirmation Requirements  \n\u201cConfirmation of a plan of r eorganization is the statutory goal of every chapter 11 case.\u201d  \n7 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b61129.01 (16th ed. 2020).  Before confirming a plan, a court must determine (subject to one notable exception explained below) that \u201call . . . of the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code are satisfied.  In re Combustion Eng\u2019g, Inc.,  391 F.3d 190, 243 \nn.59 (3d Cir. 2004).  Section 1129(a) contains many  requirements , but only a few are relevant to \nthis appeal .  First, \u00a7 1129(a)(3) req uires the court to determine that \u201c[t]he plan has been proposed in \ngood faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\u201d  11 U.S.C . \u00a7 1129(a)(3).  Section 1129(a)(7) \nrequires that (\u201cWith respect to each impaired  class of claims or interests, each holder of a claim . . . \nhas accepted the plan; or will receive or retain under the plan on account of such claim or interest 13 property of a value . . .  that is not less than the amount that such holder would receive or retain if \nthe debtor were liquidated under chapter  7 of [the Bankruptcy Code.]\u201d)  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(7) \n(emphasis added).   Section  1129(a)(11 ) requires the court to determine tha t the plan is feasible  \u2013 \ni.e., \u201cnot likely to be followed by the liquidation , or the need for further financial reorganization, of \nthe debtor . . .\u201d   11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(11).  Finally, the Bankruptcy Code  authorizes a departure from \nstrict adherence to these requirements in one circumstance, which is codified in \u00a7 1129(b)  \u2013 often \nreferred to as the \u201ccramdown\u201d provis ion.  See RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC , 566 U.S. 639, 641- 42 \n(2012) .  That provision states that, so long as all \u00a7 1129(a) requirements are satisfied except for \n\u00a7 1129(a)(8)  \u2013 which requires the court to determine that each creditor class has either accepted the \nplan or is otherwise unimpaired by the plan \u2013 then the court may still confirm a plan if it \u201cdoes not \ndiscriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that \nis impaired  under, and has not accepted, the plan.\u201d   11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(b)  (emphasis added).  \nB.

See id. at 217 \n& 219 n.28 (limiting certain insurers\u2019 appellate standing to challenge only one plan provision \nregarding i nsurance neutrality); In re G -I Holdings Inc., 420 B.R. 216, 255  (D.N.J. 2009) (\u201cAs an \nunimpaired creditor, the provisions of the plan relating to \u00a7 1129(b) have  no effect on the interests \nof the IRS.\u201d); In re A.P.I., Inc., 331 B.R. 828, 857 n.48 (Bankr.

May 25, 2006) (\u201c[The \nBankruptcy Code] generally denies standing to object  to confirmation when a plan does not impair \na particular creditor\u2019s claim.\u201d) . \nC. Appellants Lack Appellate Standing to Raise Issue s 4 & 5 \nThe Plan left all creditors, other than DOE, unimpaired, and provided that all general \nunsecured claims , like Appellants\u2019 contingent litigation claims,  would ride through to the \nreorganized enti ty.  Appellants have appellate standing to  appeal the C onfirmation Order only to the \nextent that their  \u201crights or interests are directly and adversely affected pecuniarily \u201d by the \nConfirmation Order  \u2013 i.e., whether  the Plan contains sufficient funding to satisfy Appellants\u2019  claim s \nif they are ultimately successful in the Nevada Action .  The question of whether the P lan contains \nsufficient funding is an issue of feasibility , and the only confirmation standard properly before this \nCourt on appeal is feasibility.   (See 11/16/20 Tr. at 18:5- 11).   \nAppellants do not have standing to appeal the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding that the Plan \nsatisfied the best interests of creditors test under \u00a7 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code because, by 15 its terms, this provision applies only to impaired  creditors. 11 U.S .C. \u00a7 1129(a)(7) (\u201cWith respect \nto each impaired  class of claims or interests, each holder of a claim . . . has accepted the plan; or \nwill receive or retain under the plan on account of such claim or interest property of a value . . . that \nis not less than  the amount that such holder would receive or retain if the debtor were liquidated \nunder chapter 7 of [the Bankruptcy Code.]\u201d) (emphasis added).  Section 1129(b) similarly applies \nonly in the context of a \u201ccramdown\u201d of a plan over the objection of an impai red class of creditors \nor equity holders.  In re Abeinsa Holding, Inc., 562 B.R. 265, 276 (Bankr. D. Del. 2016) (\u201cT]he \nBankruptcy Code allows a plan proponent to \u2018cram down\u2019 the plan on non- accepting impaired  \nclasses under \u00a7 1129(b)(1)[.]\u201d) (emphasis added).  Nor do Appellants possess standing to question  \nthe good faith of the Plan, the release and exculpation provisions, or the appropriateness of  \nsettlements embodied in the Plan.  Even assuming a better settlement could be reached by  Tonopah, \nDOE, and Cobr a, any enhancement from such settlement would not inure to the benefit  of \nunimpaired general unsecured creditors, who are already recovering 100% on account of their  \nclaims.   The only creditor with a stake in these issues is the DOE, who voted in favor of the Plan, \neven though it may recover as little as 47% on account of its secured claims against Tonopah.   \n(MTD0214) .  Appellants likewise are not impaired by  the Plan\u2019s consen sual third -party release \ngiven that they did not opt into this release.   \nAppellants fail to  establish that their pecuniary interests are adversely affected by the \nBankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that the Plan satisfied \u00a7\u00a7 1129(a) and (b) of the Bankruptc y Code , \nother than arguably with respect to the limited issue of Plan feasibility  addressed below .  \nAccordingly, the Motion to Strike Issues 4 & 5 will be granted.  \nV. PLAN FEASIBILITY FINDING  (ISSUES 1 -3) \nSection 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that confirmation of the plan is not \nlikely to be followed by the liquidation or further financial reorganization of the debtor (or any 16 successor thereto).  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(11).  This \u201cfeasibility\u201d standard requires that \u201cthe Plan is \nworkable and has a reasonable likelihood of success.\u201d  In re Drexel Burnham  Lambert Grp., Inc., \n138 B.R. 723, 762 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1992).  A guarantee of success is not required.  Id.; see also In \nre W .R. Grace & Co. , 729 F.3d 332, 349 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[Debtor] needed only to demonstrate a \nreasonable likelihood of success, not an absolute certainty.\u201d); see also Kane v. Johns -Manville Corp. \n(In re Johns -Manville Corp.) , 843 F.2d 636, 649 (2d Cir. 1988) (\u201c [T]he feasibility standard is \nwhether the plan offers a reasonable assurance of success.  Success need not be guaranteed .\u201d).  The \ndebtor must establish this feasibility by a preponderance of the evidence.  See In re Armstrong World \nIndus., Inc ., 348 B.R. 111, 120 (Bankr. D. Del. 2006). \nA. Evidence and Compromises Support ing Plan Feasibility  \nAppellants contend that \u201cthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings are unsupported by any credible \nand admissible evidence.\u201d  (D.I. 19 at 10).  The record reflects that, i n support of pla n confirmation, \nTonopah filed a comprehensive brief (A0751- 0819)  (\u201cConfirmation Brief\u201d) , which also responded \nto Appellants\u2019  Confirmation Objection.  Tonopah further filed the Declaration of Justin Pugh  \n(A0820- 0845) (\u201cPugh Decl.\u201d) , a Managing Director of FTI Consulting, Inc. (\u201cFTI\u201d),  who served as \nTonopah\u2019s Treasurer since December 4, 2017.  (Pugh Decl. \u00b6 1) .  Because Tonopah\u2019s LLC \nAgreement prevented it from directly employing personnel, it had no employees of its own; Tonopah \nwas entirely man aged by FTI, whose actions were  overseen and directed by Tonopah\u2019s Board of \nManagers, and obtained operational support from  third -party contractors.  (A0276) .  As a result, \nMr. Pugh was  intimately involved in all aspects of Tonopah\u2019s operations, business affairs, and \nfinancial  condition.  (Pugh Decl . \u00b6\u00b6 1-6).  Tonopah also filed the Expert Valuation Report of \nDaniel  B. Beaulne  (A0648- 0750)  (\u201cBeaulne Report\u201d) , setting forth an expert opinion of a Houlihan \nLokey financial advisor regarding the fair market value of the Project.  17  On November 19, 2020,  Appellants filed two expert declarations: (1) the  Declaration of \nTodd Schatzki, Ph.D. ( A0846- 0902) (\u201c Schatzki Decl. \u201d), which offered an opinion on the reliability \nof Tonopah\u2019s financial projections for the years 2021 to 2025, as  provided in Amended Disclosure \nStatement (A0398)  (\u201cFinancial  Projections\u201d), and the going- forward economic viability of the  \nProject ; and (2) the Declaration of Joseph Jaskulski  (A0903- 0935) (\u201cJaskulski Decl.\u201d) , which opined  \non CPI\u2019s performance \u201cand the impact of that performance on the future  performance of the Crescent \nDunes Thermosolar Power Plant.\u201d   Hours before the Confirmation Hearing, Appellants also filed a \nlimited objection to paragraphs 38- 40 and 42- 44 of  the Pugh Declaration , which were the  portions \nof the Pugh Declaration that addressed feasibility (A0938-0947)  (\u201cPugh Objection\u201d) . \n On November 20, 2020 the Bankruptcy Court commenced the  two-day Confirmation \nHearing , at which  it received witness testimony and documentary evidence concerning confirmation \nof the Plan.  Prior to the Confirmation Hearing, the parties and the Bankruptcy Court contemplated \nthat witnesses would provide direct testimony through previously submitted dec larations and then \nbe subject to cross examination; however, given the Pugh Objection, the Bankruptcy Court sought a direct examination of  Mr. Pugh.  (Id. at 18:08- 19:09) .  The Bankruptcy Court entered those \nportions of the Pugh  Declaration into evidence t hat were not subject to the Pugh Objection, and  \ninstructed that it would enter the paragraphs subject to the Pugh Objection only if  Tonopah\u2019s counsel \nlaid a  foundation for the  testimony through direct examination.  (11/20/20 Tr. at 18:7- 15).  In \nparticular, the Bankruptcy Court noted that Mr. Pugh was a \u201clay  witness\u201d under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 701, thus \u201chis opinion needs to be  rationally based on his perception.\u201d  ( Id. at 18:7- 15). \n After Mr. Pugh provided sufficient foundation for the lay opinions provided in the  Pugh \nDeclaration, the Bankruptcy Court allowed his testimony on nearly all of the topics that  were subject \nto the Pugh Objection.  ( See id. at 29:7- 13, 42:25- 43:1 (allowing testimony concerning \u201cwhen \n[Mr. Pugh] thinks the plant will be operational\u201d and hot salt tank repair timeline and tasks, as 18 described in paragraph 38 of the Pugh Declaration); id . at 36:5- 38:4, 43:9- 48:3 (allowing testimony \nconcerning recent discussions with NVE about its  willingness to pay Tonopah $70/MWh for \nelectricity and NVE\u2019s view of the Plant as similar to  geothermal generators, as described in \nparagraph 39 of the Pugh Declaration); id . at 29:7- 36:3 (allowing testimony concerning assumption \nthat the Plant will be able to continuously generate 400 GWh, as described in paragraph 40 of the \nPugh Declaration); id . at 48:8- 50:7 (discussing Tonopah\u2019s post -emergence capital structure, \nincluding its $100 mil lion in equity, $100 million in debt, approximately $63 million cash on hand, \nand $50 million working capital  facility, which was later increased, as described in paragraphs 42 -\n44 of the Pugh Declaration) ).  The court  also denied hearsay objections to expl anations Mr. Pugh \nprovided as to where certain assumptions came from.  (Id. at 29:7- 30:5 (allowing testimony \nconcerning \u201cwhen [Mr. Pugh] thinks the plant will be operational\u201d and stating that the testimony \nwill be  given \u201cthe weight that . . . it deserves\u201d); id . at 38:1- 4 (allowing testimony concerning \nconversation between Tonopah and NVE regarding the PPA); id . at 48:2- 3 (overruling hearsay \nobjection to email exchange between Tonopah\u2019s President, Chris LeWand, reflecting status of recent \nPPA negotiations with t he NVE (A 0936) (\u201cPPA Email\u201d) )). \nIn addition to Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony, Tonopah moved documentary exhibits into the \nevidentiary record, including a schedule detailing repairs to the Plant\u2019s hot salt tank (A0552)  \n(\u201cRepair Schedule\u201d)  (id. at 40:3- 43:3) ; the PPA Email ( A0936) (id. at 43:13- 48:5);  a report titled  \n\u201cCommercial Value and Strategy\u201d prepared by Energy GPS Consulting for Tonopah (A0534) \n(\u201cEnergyGPS Report\u201d) (id. at 82:21- 25); and the Beaulne Report  (A0648) (id. at 8:15- 23). \nAppellants presented expe rt testimony from their two expert witnesses, Dr. Schatzki and \nMr. Jaskulski, including testimony by Mr. Jaskulski that he was  \u201cimpressed by the quality\u201d of the \nhot salt tank designs, the management of the Plant, and the  Plant\u2019s reconstruction team, and that it \nwas \u201cmore likely than not that the people working on the  reconstruction efforts\u201d at the Plant would 19 \u201cget it right this time.\u201d  (Id. at 126:15- 127:5, 132:17- 20).  Appellants also moved several exhibits \ninto the evidentiary r ecord.  ( See id. at  110:20- 208:10).  \nFollowing various meet -and-confer sessions, the parties advised the c ourt that the agreed -\nupon evidentiary record consisted of all of Appellants\u2019 exhibits and substantially all of Tonopah\u2019s \nexhibits, subject to the c ourt\u2019s rulings on the Pugh Declaration.  ( See A1168 (\u201cExhibits Email\u201d); \n12/3/20 Tr. at 5:1- 7).  The parties also agreed that the voluminous materials supporting the  Schatzki \nand Jaskulski\u2019s expert  reports were admitted by the c ourt during the Confirmation Hear ing.  ( Id.). \n At the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s request, Tonopah, CMB, and SolarReserve participated in an \ninformal mediation with Judge Shannon after concluding the first day of the Confirmation Hearing.  \n(12/3/20 Tr. at 4:5- 7, 14- 19, 99:15- 18).  As a result of that mediation, Tonopah and Cobra agreed to \ntwo enhancements to the Plan.  (Id. at 6:18- 25, 7:1- 21, 93:9- 15).  First , Cobra agreed to provide the \n$6 million  CMB/SR Letter of Credit in favor of Appellants as a reserve to be drawn on in the event \nthat they obtain a final, non- appealable judgment against Tonopah and Tonopah fails to pay that  \njudgment.  ( Id. at 7:7 -15).  Second, Cobra agreed to increase an initial total working capital facility \nof $50 million by $14 million ( \u201cWorking Capital Fac ility\u201d).  (Id. at 7:16- 21). \n B. Feasibility Finding  \nOn December 3, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court concluded the Confirmation Hearing and ruled \nthat the record supported a finding that the Plan was feasible, particularly in light of the  CMB/SR \nLetter of Credit and the increased Working Capital Facility.  (Id. at 6:18- 25, 7:1- 21, 93:9- 15).  With \nrespect to the Nevada Complaint , the court observed that the claims  were \u201cbased on a lawsuit that\u2019s \nin its infancy and that will not be adjudicate d for some time,\u201d  that the \u201cvarious Cobra defendants \nare likely to bear [the] weight of the damages sought if the  suit is successful given CMB \nSolarReserve\u2019s own complaint admissions and theories,\u201d and that  \u201cthe claims face intense \nopposition from the debt or, based on, from what I can tell, substantial  defenses.\u201d  (Id. at 96:9- 17).  20 As a result, the c ourt considered it  \u201cunreasonable for feasibility purposes to assume that CMB \nSolarReserve will ultimately have a  $90 million . . . claim against the debtor\u2019s estat e or anything \nclose to that amount.\u201d  ( Id. at 96:18- 21).  The Bankruptcy Court further ruled that the Plan satisfied \neach of the Bankruptcy  Code\u2019s other confirmation requirements.  ( Id. at 93:9- 15). \nC. Plan Feasibility Under \u00a7 1129(a)(11)  \n \nAs noted, plan feasibility requires that \u201cthe Plan is workable and has a reasonable likelihood \nof success.\u201d  Drexel , 138 B.R. at 762.  A guarantee of success is not required.  Id .  \u201c[Debtor] need [s] \nonly to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success, not an absolute certainty.\u201d  W .R. Grace , \n729 F.3d at 349.

Dec. 5, 2019).  \u201cThe mere potential for failure of the \nplan is insuffi cient to disprove feasibility.\u201d  In re Patrician St. Joseph Partners L.P., 169 B.R. 669, \n674 (D. Ariz. 1994); see also In re Drexel , 138 B.R. at 763 (\u201c[S]peculative prospects of failure \ncannot defeat feasibility.\u201d).  To find that a debtor must go beyond showing that the plan has a \n\u201creasonable prospect of success\u201d would impose \u201can extraordinary duty on the Debtor that is simply \nnot mandated by the Code.\u201d  In re Wetdog, LLC , 518 B.R. 126, 139 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 2014) (financial \nprojections showing that Debtor would have positive cash flow for the next few  years unless the \nworst case scenario from Plan opponent\u2019s expert\u2019s report happened supported feasibility \ndetermination).  \nIn evaluating feasibility, courts have identified the following probative factors : (i) the \nadequacy of the debtor\u2019s capital structure; (ii) the earning power of its business; (iii)  economic \nconditions; (iv) the ability of the debtor\u2019s management; (v) the probability of the  continuation of the \nsame management; and (vi) any other related  matters which determine the  prospects of a sufficiently \nsuccessful operation to enable performance of the provision of the  plan.  Emerge, 2019 WL \n7634308, at *15 (citations omitted).   21 As Debtor correctly points out, Appellants face a high hurdle to demonstrate that the \nBankruptcy Court  committed clear error when it determined that the Plan was feasible and entered \nthe Confirmation Order  \u2013 Appellants  must demonstrate that the findings are \u201ccompletely devoid of \na credible evidentiary basis or bear[ ] no rational relationship to the supporting data .\u201d  Coastal \nBroad. Sy s., 570 F. App\u2019x. at  193; see also Corestates Bank, N.A. v. United Chem. Techs., Inc., 202 \nB.R. 33, 45 (E.D. Pa. 1996) (\u201cFeasibility is a factual question subject to the clearly erroneous \nstandard of review.\u201d).  And in estimating the value of a pending civil litigation claim for the purpose \nof assessing feasibility, the bankruptcy court may determine the value of the claim \u201cusing whatever \nmethod is best suited to the particular contingencies a t issue.\u201d  See Bittner v. Borne Chem. Co., Inc., \n691 F.2d 134, 135 (3d Cir. 1982).   \nD. Appellants Fail to Demonstrate Clear Error as to  the Feasibility Finding  \n \nThe Court agrees with Debtor that Appellants\u2019 arguments on appeal suffer from two \noverriding flaws: (1) a misunderstanding of  the feasibility standard , and (2) a mischaracteriz ation \nof the evidentiary record relied upon.   \nFirst, Appellants urge this Court  to overturn the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s feasibility determination \nbased on Tonopah\u2019s alleged failure to provide \u201cany\u201d credible or admissible evidence at the \nConfirmation Hearing that it can \u201cdeliver\u201d on certain \u201cpromises\u201d set out in the Plan; namely  that: \n(a) Tonopah can repair the Plant; (b) the Plant will generate 400 GWh of e lectricity per year ; \n(c) Tonopah will obtain an agreement to sell the energy for $70 per MWh; and (d) Tonopah can pay \ncreditors and post -confirmation operational expenses.  (D.I. 19 at 15).  Based on this alleged failure, \nAppellants argue, Tonopah \u201cdid not establish it can do what it plans to do, in the time period allowed, on the terms set forth in the plan.\u201d   (Id.)  It is evident , however , that \u201c[a]ppellants seek, in effect, a \nguarantee [of the Plan\u2019s success] .  But that is not the standard.  The Plan must offer only a reasonable \nprospect for success.\u201d  In re  Dana Corp., 2008 WL 11404248, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2008).  22 Appellants take th eir argument  one step further, as Debtor points out, seeking a guarantee that \nTonopah\u2019s financial projections will be accurate down to the gigawatt and dollar. ( See D.I. 19 at 32-\n33 (questioning Tonopah\u2019s capacity to sell energy for $70 per MWh or generate  400 GWh of \nelectricity per year)).   This is also not the standard.  The Bankruptcy Court was not obligated to \nmake a feasibility determination based on a finding that Tonopah\u2019s Financial Projections would be \naccurate to the level of individual assumptions .  The Bankruptcy Court was only required to \ndetermine that the Plan was \u201cworkable\u201d and that it was \u201creasonably likely\u201d that Tonopah would be \nable to fulfill its obligations under the Plan , meet ing estimated costs of administration while \nmaintaining suffic ient liquidity and capital resources.   \nSecond, Appellants argue that the Bankruptcy Court only relied on Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony, \ndeclaration, and Financial Projections in making its feasibility determination, and that such evidence \nwas inadmissible.  (See, e.g., D.I. 19 at 35) .  This argument reads out of the record significant \nevidence admitted by the Bankruptcy Court without objection from Appellants.   \n1. No Clear Error in Findings Supporting Feasibility  \n \na. The Bankruptcy Court Correctly Determined Plan\u2019s Substantial Cushion Mitigated Liquidation Risk   \n \nDebtor asserts that t he Plan provides for a substantial capital facility which alone is sufficient \nto support a finding of feasibility.  (D.I. 20 at 20- 21).  The Plan establishes a working capital facility \nof $64 million which can be drawn from as needed to cover operating expenses and future repairs \nto the Plant, as well as the $6 million CMB/SR Letter of Credit backing final judgments against Tonopah in conne ction with the litigation claims .  (Plan  \u00a7 7.5; \u00a7 7.14) .  This, in addition to the \nprojected $7.5 million of cash on hand, means the Plan provides $71.5 million of cushion to mitigate \nrisk of liquidation following emergence.  ( Pugh. Decl. \u00b6 41; 11/20/20 Tr . 78:8 -11).  Even assuming \nthe Plant never becomes operable \u2013 taking into account either Tonopah\u2019s ($21.7 million) or 23 Appellants\u2019 estimation of operating costs ($22 million)  \u2013 Tonopah can operate for approximately \nthree years without generating any revenue .  (A0398; Schatzki Decl.  at 8; 11/20/20 Tr.  179:16- 19).  \nAppellants\u2019 expert agreed, testifying that the pre -enhanced $50 million working capital facility \nwould cover the operating costs of the Plant for two years.  (Id. 178:21- 179:14).  \nBased on the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Court properly consider this cushion in making its \nfeasibility  determination, ruling that the Plan is feasible, \u201cespecially in light of  the enhancements \nrecently proposed by the debtor that will inure to CMB SolarRese rve\u2019s benefit,  directly and \nindirectly; mainly, the $6 million dollar letter of credit for their benefit and the  increase of the \ndebtor\u2019s post -emergence working capital facility.\u201d  (12/3/20 Tr. at 93:09- 15).  The court correctly \nconcluded, in line with Appellants\u2019 own expert, that, with the increased Working Capital Facility, \nTonopah will have  sufficient liquidity to operate for approximately three years.  ( Id. at 94:20- 23). \nOn appeal, A ppellants insist that the cushion cannot support a feasibility finding because \nTonopah allegedly \u201cfailed to address [that] this amount would be insufficient if Appellants claims \n[in the Nevada litigation] are allowed.\u201d  (D.I. 19 at 34) .  Appellants contend that \u201cDebtor cannot \nargue that it will not need to reorganize or liquidate because it can use this  amount to pay for \noperational expenses and at the same time argue that it has capital available to  pay Appellants\u2019 \nclaims if they are allowed.\u201d  (Id.).  As Debtor correctly argues, however, this type of speculative \nargument  is precisely  the type of argument that courts reject in making feasibility determinations. \nSee In re Drexel , 138 B.R. at 763.  Indeed, Appellants\u2019  position that the $71.5 million cushion (plus \nthe $6 million CMB/SR Letter of Credit) will not be  adequate contemplates an unlikely scenario \nwhereby (a) the Plant  never operates or generates revenue again , and (b) the Nevada Complaint \nsurvives dismissal and proceeds to litigation , and Tonopah is held liable for the full $90 million \nclaim  despite the fact that t he majority of Appellants\u2019 claims target Cobra .  Courts do not make \nfeasibility determinations based on this type of conjecture.  See Dana Corp., 2008 WL 11404248 at 24 *5.  By contrast, Tonopah\u2019s Working Capital Facility provide s direct support for the  court\u2019s finding \nthat the Plan is feasible.  See Emerge, 2019 WL 7634308 at *15 (holding plan feasible as  \n\u201creorganized debtors will have approximately $50 million available under their exit facility to satisfy \nobligations as they come due.\u201d).    \nb. The Bankruptcy Court Properly Weighed the Likelihood that the Plant \nWould Become Operational and Profitable  \n \n The Bankruptcy Court found that \u201c[g]iven the totality of the circumstances,\u201d Tonopah\u2019s \nassumption that it would repair the Plant and achieve successful operations in the near term as \nprojected was not \u201cfanci[ful] or even unlikely.\u201d ( Id. at 95:13- 16).  Debtor argues that ample \nevidence, including testimony from Appellants\u2019 own expert, supported Tonopah\u2019s assumptions, as reflected in the Financial Projections, that (i) the Plant\u2019s repairs will be successful; (ii) the Plant will generate enough energy to be profi table; and (iii) the Plant will sell energy at a profitable price point.  \n Regarding repairs, Appellants\u2019 expert Mr. Jaskulski testified that Tonopah\u2019s repairs to the \nPlant were likely to be successful. ( See id. at 94:10- 13; 11/20/20 Tr. at 132:17- 20 (testi fying that it \nwas \u201cmore likely than not that the people working on the reconstruction efforts [of the Plant] get it \nright this time\u201d) ).  Mr. Jaskulski further testified that he was impressed by the quality of the designs \nfor the hot salt tank, the quality of the management of the work of Tonopah, and the designs prepared by an engineering consultant for the Project.  (Id. at 126:15- 127:01) . Mr. Jaskulski confirmed the \n\u201cteam involved in the reconstruction of the Tonopah Plant is giving it their best effort\u201d and that there\u2019s a reasonable likelihood that the people involved in the redesign and reconstruction will learn from the past.  ( Id. at 127:02- 05, 130:10- 17). \n Regarding energy generation, Tonopah\u2019s financial projections estimated that the Plant will \ngenerate 400 GWh in electricity beginning in 2021, increasing at one percent per year.  (A0398).  \nAppellants argue that no credible evidence establishes that the Plant can generate this level of 25 electricity .  But Appellants\u2019 own experts supported Tonopah\u2019s assumption that the Plant, once \nrepaired, would be capable of generating enough energy to be profitable.  Both of Appellants\u2019 \nexperts agreed that the Plant has the ability to deliver over 500 GWh of electricity annually.  \n(See Schatzki Decl.  at 4; 11/20/20 Tr. at 125:03- 06).  Moreover, the evidence also showed that the \nPlant would not have to generate 400 GWh of electricity annually to be profi table. Under \nAppellants\u2019 expert\u2019s \u201cmost  likely\u201d scenario for power generation, the Plant will generate between \n352.5 to 368 GWh annually, a difference from Tonopah\u2019s own projections of only 13\u201314% per year.  \n(See Jaskulski  Decl.  at 27 ).  \n Regarding pricing, Tonopah submitted evidence support ing its assumption that it can sell \nelectricity at a price point which would render the Plant profitable , with a plan to sell electricity at \n$70 per MWh pursuant to a new PPA with NVE .  The Debtor introd uced this plan through \nMr. Pugh\u2019s testimony and the Beaulne Report .  (Pugh Decl. \u00b6 39; 11/20/20 Tr. at 36:5- 37; Beaulne \nReport at 42).  Mr. Beaulne reviewed the Financial Projections , found them to be reasonable , and  \nfurther  determined that $70 per MWh was not significantly different from the price  Tonopah would \nreceive if it did not have a PPA in place.  (Beaulne Report at 3, 43) .  The Beaulne Report was \nadmitted into evidence during the Confirmation Hearing without  objectio n (11/20/ 20 Tr. at 8:15-\n12), and independently supports Tonopah\u2019s projected sale price of $70/MWh.  At this price point, \neven assuming the Plant only generates the low end of Appellants\u2019 expert\u2019s prediction for the Plant\u2019s power output (352.5 GWh annually) , the Plant will generate over $2.7 million in excess cash a year .\n4  \nEven without a PPA  in place, other evidence support s a determination that Tonopah has other \nmonetization streams available once the Plant is operating, including (1) dispatching energy i nto the \n \n4  352.5 MWh x $70 = $24,675,000, minus $21,700,000 (operating expenses), minus \nDr. Schatzki\u2019s  figure for variable costs (352.5 MWh x $0.71/MWh = $250,275) = \n$2,747,725 per year.  26 wholesale market; (2) monetizing its capacity value; and (3) sale of renewable energy credits.  \n(Pugh Decl. \u00b6 39; Beaulne Report  at 13 ; EnergyGPS Report at 1).  \nAppellants argue on appeal that there i s \u201c[n]o evidentiary support that Debtor can sell  energy \nfor $70.00 per MWh.\u201d  (D.I. 19 at 29).   But e ven assuming Appellants  are correct, t he Bankruptcy \nCourt did not rely on Tonopah\u2019s projection of obtaining $70/MWh in making  its feasibility \ndetermination.  The Bankruptcy Court found that \u201cCMB  SolarReserve\u2019s own expert testified, and \nthe evidence reflects . . . that the debtors could sell  electricity for approximately $48 dollars per \nmegawatt [hour].\u201d  (12/3/20 Tr. at 94:10- 14).  Even assuming that Tonopah can sell energy for only \n$48/MWh, the evide nce supported a determination that it is reasonably likely that Tonopah will not \nface a future liquidation, especially given the Working Capital Facility. \nc. The Bankruptcy Court Properly Weighed t he Likelihood of Appellants \nObtaining A $90 Million Judgment In The Nevada Action \n  \nThe Bankruptcy Court determined that it is \u201cunreasonable for feasibility purposes to assume \nthat CMB [or] SolarReserve will ultimately have a $90 million claim against the debtor\u2019s estate or \nanything close to that amount.\u201d  (12/3/20 Tr. at 96:18- 21).  Although the Bankruptcy Court \nacknowledged that Tonopah would not have sufficient funds to pay a $90 million judgment, it concluded that Tonopah\u2019s defenses were \u201csubstantial\u201d and the claims were not worth $90 million \nor \u201canything close to that amount.\u201d  (12/3/ 20 Tr. at 15- 21).  The court noted that Appellants\u2019 proofs \nof claim  are contingent, unliquidated, and disputed, and based on a lawsuit in its infancy that will \nnot be adjudicated for some time.  (Id. at 96:01- 11).  \u201cMoreover, the various Cobra defendants are \nlikely to bear [the] weight of the damages sought if the suit is successful given CMB\u2019s own \ncomplaint admissions and theories.  And the claims alleged face intense opposition from the debtor, \nbased on from what I  can tell, substantial defenses.\u201d  ( Id. at 97:12- 17).   27 In estimating the value of Appellants\u2019 litigation  claim for the purpose of assessing plan \nfeasibility, the B ankruptcy Court is permitted to  \u201cus[e] whatever method is best suited to the \nparticular cont ingencies at issue.\u201d  Bittner , 691 F.2d at  135.  Indeed, t he court may estimate the \nvalue through a simple review of  the pleadings and oral argument.  See In re Windsor Plumbing \nSupply Co., 170 B.R. 503, 520 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1994) (citations omitted).   The Bankruptcy Court \nmade its determination a fter receiving substantial motion to dismiss briefing from the parties \nconcerning the  claims alleged in the Nevada Complaint .  The issue of the sufficiency of the Nevada \nComplaint was addressed in the  Claim Objection  and Confirmation Brief, and was also the subject \nof oral argument at the Confirmation Hearing.  (12/3/20 Tr. at 37:04- 46:24).   \nThe record supports the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s conclusion.  As of the date of the Confirmation \nHearing, Tonopah had not even been served with the Nevada Complaint.  (12/3/20 Tr. 45:06- 11).  \nThe bulk of Appellants\u2019 claims do not relate to Tonopah, and those  that do are derivative of more \nsubstantial claims against other defendants.  (See A0446 (CMB proof of claim alleging that the \nProject was \u201cplagued by repeated  failures by [CPI]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Project\u2019s failure is due almost \nentirely to [CPI]\u201d) ).  Appella nts\u2019 $90 million contingent claim against Tonopah would need to not \nonly survive a  motion to dismiss, discovery, and a trial, but would need to be substantially \napportioned to Tonopah, alleged as a mere aider and abettor  \u2013 even though the complaint also alleges \nthat \u201c[t]he  Project\u2019s failure is due almost entirely to [CPI].\u201d  (Id.).  And i n recognition of a more \nrealistic assessment of the fair value of Appellants\u2019 litigation claims, following the mediation before \nJudge Shannon, Cobra agreed to post the $6 million CMB/SR Letter of Credit and increase d the \nWorking Capital Facility , as a backstop against a future judgment and damages award against \nTonopah in the Nevada Action.  The Court finds no clear error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s valuation \nof the litigatio n claims as substantially less than $90 million and its  determination that the  Plan\u2019s \ncushion, as supplemented by the backstop, presented a workable  provision for payment of 28 Appellants\u2019 contingent litigation claims .  Appellants \u2019 apparent insist ence that the P lan set aside $90 \nmillion for their claims  is based upon speculation that Debtor will be found liable for  the full $90 \nmillion  and unable to pay  the full amount .  Appellants\u2019 mere speculation of such a n outcome  is not \nenough to defeat confirmation on feasibility grounds because the mere \u201cpossibility of failure is not \nfatal to confirmation.\u201d  In re  W.R. Grace & Co., 475 B.R. 34, 120 (D. Del. 2012)  (internal quotes \nomitted).  \n2. No Abuse of Discretion i n Evidentiary Rulings  \n \na. Mr. Pugh\u2019s  Testimony Was Not Hearsay  \n \n A statement is hearsay if \u201c(1) the declarant does not make [it] while  testifying at the current \ntrial or hearing; and (2) a party offers [it] in evidence to prove the truth  of the matter assert ed in the \nstatement.\u201d  Fed. R. E vid. 801(c).  If a statement is offered in court  for a purpose other than proving \nthe truth of the matter asserted, then it is not hearsay.  Anderson v. U.S., 417 U.S. 211, 219 (1974) \n(\u201cOut -of-court statements constitute  hearsay only when offered in evidence to prove the truth of the \nmatter asserted.\u201d) .  For example,  if an out -of-court statement is offered to \u201cprovide context\u201d for \nwhat a person knew, the  statement is not hearsay.  U.S. v. Rowland, 826 F.3d 100, 115 (2d Cir. \n2016). \n Mr. Pugh served as the Treasurer of Tonopah since  December 4, 2017.  (Pugh Decl . \u00b6 1).  In \nthat capacity, he  became familiar with all aspects of Tonopah\u2019s operations, business affairs, and \nfinancial condition.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 1 -6).  Mr. Pugh was responsible for  supervising  Tonopah\u2019s remediation \nand repair of the hot salt tank and returning the Plant to full  operability.  In that role, Mr. Pugh \nsupervised the team responsible for repairing the hot salt tank, spoke daily with the two FTI \nemployees managing the hot salt tank repair process on the ground,  and attended status calls ever y \nother week.  (11/20/20 Tr. 22:22- 24:10) .  In connection with the  chapter 11 case, Mr. Pugh also \nprepared Tonopah\u2019s  Financial Projections.  (See A0398; Pugh Declaration \u00b6 37;  11/20/20 Tr. 30:8-29 31:9) .  In preparing the Financial Projections, which  Tonopah submitted to the Bankruptcy Court, \nin part, to demonstrate that the Plan meets  the feasibility requirement, Mr. Pugh analyzed Tonopah\u2019s \noperating expenses and projected costs.  (Pugh Decl . \u00b6 37).  Mr. Pugh based his analyses on a  set of \nassumptions rooted in his and management\u2019s experiences and historical trends and data, and \n\u201cincorporated  material considerations pertaining to the current industry environment, historical \noperating and production performance, [management\u2019s] knowledge and r elationship with vendors \nand prospective customers, and [Tonopah\u2019s] operating costs.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 37).  Appellants did not object \nto admitting the Financial Projections into evidence.   \nAt the Confirmation Hearing, Mr. Pugh testified about his preparation of t he Financial \nProjections, including the underlying assumptions and material considerations  incorporated therein.  \n(11/20/20 Tr. at 31:10 -33:4, 35:23- 37:1, 39:1- 22, 40:3- 41:3, 41:18- 42:4, 43:13- 46:8, 48:8- 50:7) .  \nAmong other things, Mr. Pugh testified conce rning his  assumptions regarding the date that repairs \nto the Plant were expected to be completed and  Tonopah\u2019s ability to enter into a new PPA with \nfavorable pricing.  ( Id. at 36:5- 37:1 (testifying concerning the Financial Projections\u2019 assumption of \na PPA price of $70.00 MWh) ; id. at 40:17- 41:3 (testifying concerning the Financial Projections\u2019 \nassumption concerning \u201cwhen the plant could be recommissioned\u201d )). \nAppellants objected to aspects of Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony as hearsay  throughout the \nConfirmation Hearing.  Debtor repeatedly explained that Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony was not  being \noffered to  prove the truth of the matters asserted therein, but to explain and provide context for \nassumptions  underlying the Financial Projections.  (See id. at 14:23- 15:13 (explaining testimony  \nconcerning NVE\u2019s statements in PPA negotiations were \u201cbeing offered to explain the  assumptions \nthat Mr. Pugh made in preparing his financial projections\u201d and \u201cnot being offered for the truth of \nthe matter asserted\u201d); id. at 34:19- 25 (explaining testimony concerning Plant\u2019s  ability to generate \n400 GWh and other operating history were \u201cbeing offered to explain the basis  for the assumptions 30 that Mr. Pugh made in preparing the financial projections\u201d but not \u201cfor the  truth of the matter \nasserted\u201d); id. at 37:14- 23 (explaining Mr. Pugh testified concerning PPA negotiations with NVE \nfor a $70 per MWh pricing were being referenced \u201cto explain the basis for  the assumptions in his \nprojections\u201d rather than \u201cfor the truth of the matter asserted\u201d) ).  The Bankruptcy Court permitted \nMr. Pugh to testify for these non- hearsay  purposes, agreeing that Tonopah could \u201cput Mr. Pugh on \nthe stand to explain what the numbers  [in the Financial Projections] are and how he came up wi th \nthe numbers and why I should find that those numbers are reliable.\u201d  ( Id. at 35:23- 36:2) .  \nOn appeal, Appellants challenge three categories of Mr. Pugh\u2019s  testimony as hearsay : the \nPlant\u2019s operations , the PPA negotiations  with NVA,  and the timeline for Plant  repairs.  With respect \nto the first two categories,  the Court overruled Appellants\u2019 objections and determined that they went \nto the weight of the evidence, rather than its admissibility, and could therefore be explored on cross -\nexamination  \u2013 and they were explored extensively during the Confirmation Hearing.  (See id. at  \n34:4- 6 (advising counsel for Appellants  to probe the reliability of Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony concerning \nthe Plant\u2019s operations \u201con cross\u201d);  id. at 38:1- 17 (advising counsel for Appell ants to explore \ntestimony concerning NVE PPA  negotiations \u201con cross -examination\u201d); id. at 38:14- 17).  With \nrespect to the third category  \u2013 testimony concerning the expected completion of Plant repairs in \nFebruary 2021 \u2013 the Bankruptcy Court permitted Tonopah to offer a business record concerning the \nplanned repair and remediation of the hot salt tank.  (See A0552) .  Mr. Pugh testi fied about the \nRepair  Schedule for the purposes of explain ing why he assumed that  completion date in preparing \nthe Financial Projections, not to prove that the repairs would be  completed on time.  (11/20/20 Tr. at \n40:17- 25 (\u201c[The Repair  Schedule] was  used when the projections were put together to develop a \nbasis for when the plant could be recommissioned.\u201d )). \n Appella nts further argue on appeal that Cobra\u2019s Repair Schedule was improperly admitted \nas a business record because \u201cit was not [Tonopah\u2019s] business record. \u201d  (D.I. 19 at 19).  Business 31 records of an activity a business regularly conducts can be an exception to the rule against hearsay.  \nFed. R. E vid. 803(6).  A custodian or qualified witness must testify and lay a foundation about the \nrecords.  U.S. v. Console , 13 F.3d 641, 656 -57 (3d Cir. 1993).  Appellant s argue that t he Third \nCircuit has held tha t a qualified witness \u201cneed not be an employee of the [record- keeping] entity so \nlong as he understands the system.\u201d  Id. at 657.  \u201c The witness  need only have  familiarity with the \nrecord -keeping system  and the ability to attest to the  foundational requirements  of Rule 803(6).\u201d  Id.  \nThe foundational requirements are that: (1) the declarant in the records had knowledge to make \naccurate statements; (2) the declarant recorded statements contemporaneously wi th the actions \nwhich were the subject of the reports; (3) the declarant made the record in the regular course of the \nbusiness activity; and (4) that such records were regularly kept by the business.  Id.  Appellan ts \nassert  that Mr. Pugh could not establish  this foundation, as he is not familiar with Cobra\u2019s record -\nkeeping system , and Debtor did not provide another  qualified witness to lay the or offer other \n\u201cindicia of trustworthiness\u201d as described by the Third Circuit.  See id.  at 658.   \nConversely, Debtor argues that courts permit litigants to introduce a third -party company\u2019s \nbusiness records as their own under the business records exception where such records are \nsufficiently reliable, incorporated into the business\u2019s own records, and otherwise meet the requirements of Rule 803(6).

Apr. 2, 1986) (admitting documents as business records where available witnesses could not \n\u201cattest to the method of recordation utiliz ed\u201d by the producer of the records but had \u201cintegrated [the \ndocuments] into their internal records and . . . relied upon them in their day- to-day operations\u201d); see \nalso Brawner  v. Allstate Indemn. Co., 591 F.3d 984, 987 (8th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[T]he district court did \nnot abuse its discretion by concluding that Allstate was not required to produce an individual from \nthe entity that prepared the record to establish a foundation\u201d).  Here, Mr. Pugh, who was a corporate \nofficer of Tonopah and intimately familiar with  its recordkeeping practices, testified that he received 32 the Repair  Schedule in the  ordinary course of business, that versions of the Repair  Schedule were \nregularly sent to members  of the Tonopah team to provide updates concerning the hot salt tank \nrepairs , and that he relied on  the Repair  Schedule  as part of Tonopah\u2019s records .  (See 11/20/20 Tr. at \n39:23- 43:1) .  Although other indicia of trustworthiness  are clearly present  here, Appellants\u2019 \nargument is well taken.  Even if admission of the Repair  Schedule  was error, however, the admission \nwas harmless error  for the reasons set forth below.  \nb. Mr. Pugh Offered Admissible Lay Opinion Testimony  \n \nDuring the Confirmation Hearing, Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony concerning the status of the Plant\u2019s \nrepairs, completion timeline, ability to operate at full capacity, and PPA negotiations with NVE was \nalso admitted as lay opinion testimony.   A non- expert may offer lay opinion testimony whenever \nsuch testimony is \u201c(a)  rationally based on the w itness\u2019s perception; (b) helpful to clearly \nunderstanding the witness\u2019s  testimony or to determining a fact in issue; and (c) not based on \nscientific, technical, or other  specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d  Fed. R. Evid. \n701.  \u201cThe modern trend  favors the admission of opinion testimony, provided that it is well founded \non personal  knowledge and susceptible to specific cross -examination.\u201d  Teen -Ed, Inc. v. Kimball \nInt\u2019l, Inc. , 620 F.2d 399, 403 (3d Cir. 1980). \nIn the Third Circuit, it is well established that a person who is intimately familiar  with the \nday-to-day business affairs of a company may offer a lay opinion concerning those  affairs.  See \nLightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1175 (3d Cir. 1993) (finding \u201cknowledge and \nparticipation in the day -to-day affairs\u201d of a business supports admission of lay opinion testimony).  \nSuch opinions may rely on information and documents prepared by others  without falling outside \nthe permissible scope of a lay opinion.  Id.  Moreover, a \u201cwitness  testifying about business \noperations may testify about \u2018inferences that he could draw from his  perception\u2019 of a business\u2019s \nrecords, or \u2018facts or data perceived\u2019 by h im in his corporate capacity.\u201d   United States v. Polishan , 33 336 F.3d 234, 242 (3d Cir. 2003); see also Regscan, Inc. v. Brewer , 2007 WL 879420, at *6 (E.D. \nPa. Mar. 16, 2007) (finding senior employee \u201cwith knowledge of  the day -to-day operations of the \nbusiness, was entitled to rely on the work of the individuals who searched  . . . databases as well as \nhis own experience\u201d to provide admissible lay opinion). \n As Tonopah\u2019s long- time Treasurer who was intimately familiar with all aspects of \nTonopah\u2019s operations, bus iness affairs, and financial condition , Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony concerning \nthe core assumptions underlying the Financial Projections qualifies as an admissible lay opinion \nunder Rule 701.  Even if Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony concerned a \u201cspecialized\u201d field and  \u201cinvolved \npredictions about future business performance,\u201d he had more than adequate personal  knowledge to \noffer opinions about Tonopah\u2019s future financial condition and business plans \u201cin light of his in -\ndepth experience with the business\u2019s contracts, operating costs, and competition.\u201d   Donlin v. Philips \nLighting N. Am. Corp., 581 F.3d 73, 81 (3d Cir. 2009). \nAppellants argue Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony should have been excluded because  he was not \nqualified as an expert witness but nevertheless testified about technical topics  concerning the Plant\u2019s \noperations and ability to generate 400 GWh, the repair and remediation of  the hot salt tank, and \nmarket rates for electricity.  (D.I. 19 at 12 ).  As Debtor correctly argues, Mr. Pugh need not be an  \nexpert witness to testify about the Plant\u2019s operations, particularly given his senior role with Tonopah \nand extensive knowledge of Tonopah\u2019s business operations.  In Joy Mfg. Co. v. Sola Basic Indus., \nInc., for example, the Third Circuit considered whether a manufacturing p lant operator could offer \na lay opinion on damages that required knowledge concerning a wide range  of topics, including \nfurnace operations, contract negotiations, and pricing.  697 F.2d 104 (3d Cir. 1 982).  The Third \nCircuit held he had sufficient personal  knowledge of the plant\u2019s  operations to offer such an opinion.  \nId. at 112.  To the extent the plant manager was unable to testify about  specifics, the court observed \nthat such issues were a proper subject of cross -examination.  Id. & n.25.  Mr. Pugh has a similar 34 degree of personal knowledge concerning the Plant.  As such, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse \nits discretion by allowing his t estimony  concerning operational matters, such as his assumptions \nconcerning the hot salt tank completion date, the Plant\u2019s operability by February 2021, and the \nPlant\u2019s ability to generate 400 GWh.  \nWith respect to Appellants\u2019 argument that Mr. Pugh\u2019s testi mony concerning the  PPA \nnegotiations with NVE was hearsay, the Third Circuit permits a corporate employee  who is \nknowledgeable of the company\u2019s business affairs to offer lay opinions concerning \u201cfacts  or data \nperceived by him in his corporate capacity.\u201d  Teen-Ed, 620 F.2d at 403.  Courts within the  Third \nCircuit have permitted non -expert witnesses to offer lay opinion testimony  concerning agreements \nnegotiated between third parties on the basis of facts learned  through separate conversations with \nthose thir d parties.   See  Starland v. Fusari, 2015 WL  5771617, at *11 (D.N.J. Sept. 3, 2015) \n(permitting music artist to offer lay opinion on agent\u2019s  and producer\u2019s agreement to share 50/50 in \nprofits arising from music artist\u2019s success).   Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony concerning his assumption that \nTonopah would be able to sell electricity at $70.00  per MWh was an admissible lay opinion. \n  c. Admitting Mr. Pugh\u2019s Testimony Was, At Worst, Harmless Error  \nEven if the c ourt abused its discretion by permitting Mr. Pugh to testify concerning the \nPlant\u2019s operations, the R epair Schedule , and PPA negotiations with NVE, or by admitting the Repair \nSchedule, those evidentiary rulings will not be reversed because they  were harmless error.  See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 61 (\u201cUnless justice requires otherwise, no error in  admitting or excluding evidence  \u2013 or \nany other error by the court or a party \u2013 is ground for  granting a new trial, for setting aside a verdict, \nor for vacating, modifying, or otherwise  disturbing a judgment or order. At every stage of the \nproceeding, the court must disregard all  errors and defects that do not affect any party\u2019s substantial \nrights.\u201d).  This rule applies equally in bankruptcy cases.  See Fed. R. B ankr. P. 9005; Trans World, \n1996 WL 756962, at  *6 (allowance of certain witness testimony and exhibits not prejudicial).  35 In finding that the Plan is feasible under the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy C ourt \nacknowledged that the  \u201cmany assumptions built in the debtor\u2019s projections,\u201d  including assumptions \nconcerning \u201cthe timing to successfully completing the repairs, the  quantity of production, and the \nanticipated selling price of the electricity,\u201d \u201cmight not ultimately  prove correct.\u201d  (12/3/20 Tr. 94:15-\n19).  The Bankruptcy Court nevertheless  found that the Plan was feasible because, among  other \nthings, the Working Capital Facility would enable Tonopah to operate for at least three  years even \n\u201cif operations never resume and no revenue is generated,\u201d DOE and Cobra were supporting \nTonopah\u2019s post -emergence business,  and \u201cvarious Cobra defendants\u201d would likely bear the \u201cweight \nof the damages sought\u201d if the Nevada Action were to be successful.  ( Id. at 94:20- 98:20) . \nAs to Appellants, the  question for determining feasibility was \u201cwhether sufficient funds ar e \navailable or will be available to CMB [and] SolarReserve if it should prevail against the debtor in \nits Nevada State Court lawsuit.\u201d  (Id. at 95:16- 20).  Because the answer to that question would be \n\u201cyes,\u201d even if all of Mr. Pugh\u2019s testimony concerning P lant operations, the Repair Schedule, and \nPPA negotiations had been excluded, any error in admitting such testimony was  harmless.  See \nPhoenix v. Coatesville Area Sch. Dist., 683 F. App\u2019x 117, 121 (3d Cir. 2017)  (\u201cpermitting hearsay \nand speculative testimo ny\u201d from appellee\u2019s sole witness was harmless error  where appellee \nintroduced \u201csubstantial amount of other evidence\u201d to support outcome);  Langbord v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nTreasury , 832 F.3d 170, 196 (3d Cir. 2016) (evidentiary error is  harmless when litigant could \u201cprove \nthe elements of its case without reliance on the tainted  evidence\u201d).  \nIn sum, t he Court finds no clear error in the determin ation  that Tonopah, through the \ntestimony of Tonopah\u2019s own witness, the Beaulne Report, cross -examination of Appellants\u2019 \nwitnesses, the Working Capital Facility, the CMB/SR Letter of Credit, the Bankruptcy C ourt\u2019s \nassessment of Appellants\u2019 claims in the Nevada Complaint, and other business records, met the \u201c low \nthreshold\u201d  necessary to support a feasibility finding.  See Emerge, 2019 WL 7634308, at *15. 36 VI. MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL AS EQUITABLY MOOT  \n \nIn light of the Court\u2019s determination to affirm the Confirmation Order, the Court need not \naddress Debtor\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.  The Motion to Dismiss  is therefore denied as moot. \nVII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Motion to Strike is Granted, the Confirmation Order is \naffirmed , and the Motion to Dismiss is denied as moot .
