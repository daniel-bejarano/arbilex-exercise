CALLOWAY, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nStevie A. Jones, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nApril 5, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nLL: st a\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Stevie A. Jones, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\u2019 in\nSmyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 2) He filed a\nsupplement to the Complaint on October 21, 2021. (D.I. 10) Plaintiff appears pro se\nand has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. He has filed a request for\ncounsel and a motion for default judgment. (D.I. 11, 12) The Court proceeds to review\nand screen the matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a).\n\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and its supplement and\nassumed to be true for screening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc.,\n542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff claims Defendants violated his rights under the\nFirst, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nOn February 3, 2020, during the intake process at Sussex Correctional\nInstitution, Defendant Sgt. Calloway asked Plaintiff if he was gay and what he weighed.\n(D.I. 2 at 5) Calloway made a disparaging comment and told Plaintiff that he was\nincreasing his weight in the system because Calloway did not want to deal with placing\nPlaintiff in protective custody. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges that Calloway failed to follow\ninstitutional policy with regard to \u201csmall homosexual individuals,\u201d that Calloway violated\nPlaintiff's right to Equal Protection by not affording him the same rights as other inmates\nbecause Plaintiff is homosexual, and that Calloway violated the Eighth Amendment by\n\nsubjecting Plaintiff to physical and sexual abuse from general population inmates. (/d.)\n\n1 The incidents Plaintiff complains of occurred from February 3, 2020 to August 5, 2020\nwhile he was housed at Sussex Correctional Institution.\n1\nAfter Plaintiff had written \u201cnumerous letters to custody staff and to Prison Rape\nElmination Act personnel\u201d and \u201cexpress[ed] safety concerns to medical staff,\u201d Calloway\nremoved Plaintiff from his cell on February 10, 2020 and asked him in front of officers\nand inmates, \u201cdo we have a problem?\u201d (/d.) Plaintiff indicated that he did not want any\ntrouble and locked back into his cell. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges that Calloway\u2019s \u201cthoughts\u201d of\nPlaintiff quickly permeated through the minds of Calloway\u2019s co-workers and began a\nchain reaction of discriminatory conduct by other officers. (/d. at 6)\n\nOn February 13, 2020, Defendant C/O Lauro Diaz yelled at Plaintiff and called\nPlaintiff a \u201cfucking fag\u201d in front of the entire inmate population in the recreation yard.\n(Id.) Plaintiff responded that he would not be disrespected and Diaz yelled, \u201clock the\nfuck in fag.\u201d (/d.) Plaintiff asked to be placed in protective custody. (/d.) Diaz pepper\nsprayed Plaintiff in the face at point blank range and slammed Plaintiff to the ground.\n(Id.) Plaintiff was handcuffed behind his back and dragged off the tier. (/d.) Diaz\npacked up Plaintiff's property that was in his cell. (/d.) The property, which included\ndocuments about various officers\u2019 misconduct, legal work for his criminal case, and\ngrievances, was confiscated and never returned. (/d. at 7)\n\nOn July 12, 2020, Plaintiff was in line to have his temperature taken and\ncomplained to prison authorities that the nursing staff were not disinfecting the medical\nequipment between use of inmates. (D.I. 10 at 6) Plaintiff alleges that he was\nsubjected to contracting COVID-19 because medical staff would not disinfect the\nmedical equipment.? (/d. at 8) Every inmate refused temperature checks until the\n\nequipment was disinfected. (/d. at 6) Officers told Plaintiff to \u201cpack your shit\u201d and\n\n2 There are no allegations that Plaintiff contracted COVID.\n2\nescorted Plaintiff to administrative segregation. (/d. at 6) Plaintiff alleges this was in\nretaliation because he complained about the medical staff. (/d. at 8)\n\nWhen Plaintiff was transferred to administrative segregation, he was housed in a\nsingle-bunk cell with another inmate whose mattress was on the floor. (/d.) The toilet\ndid not work for four days. (/d.) Plaintiff complained, and correctional officers attempted\nto repair the toilet \u201cto no avail.\u201d (/d. at 7) Plaintiff alleges this violated the Eighth\nAmendment. (/d. at 8) Plaintiff remained in the cell from July 12, 2020 through August\n5, 20203 when he was transferred to JTVCC. (/d. at 7) Plaintiff alleges he was the only\ninmate who was transferred, and that the transfer was made in retaliation for his\ncomplaints about the medical staff. (/d. at 8)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that he was strip searched multiple times between July 12, 2020\nand July 16, 2020 in violation of the Fourth Amendment. He alleges that he was\nhoused in a Secured Housing Unit (SHU), away from general population inmates and\nunder constant surveillance, and that the multiple strip searches were unwarranted and\ninexcusable. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff alleges violations of his First and Eighth Amendments rights, when on\nJanuary 21, 2021, and still housed in the SHU at JTVCC, he was placed on a tier\nsurrounded with mental health inmates, and he endured mental abuse for several\nmonths. (/d. at 9) Plaintiff alleges that he has \u201chigh anxiety\u201d and constantly feared for\nhis life, resulting in in the deterioration of his mental stability. (/d.) He further alleges\n\nthat the institutional lighting policy for SHU dramatically impedes any possibility of sleep,\n\n3 The supplement states that Plaintiff was transferred to JTVCC on August 5, 2021.\nThe original complaint states that the incidents at SCI occurred from February 3, 2020\nto August 5, 2020. (See D.I. 2 at 4; D.I. 10 at 8)\n\n3\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment. (/d.) Plaintiff filed a grievance and complained\nabout the lighting and was told that it is non-grievable. (/d.)\n\nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that JTVCC will not give him a job so that he may\naccumulate \u201cgood days.\u201d (/d. at 11) Plaintiff is currently on the \u201cwaiting list.\u201d (/d.) He\nalleges this is a \u201cploy to cover-up arbitrary practices.\u201d (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Diaz\u2019s overall conduct was retaliatory and that his actions\nprevented Plaintiff from working on his criminal case and \u201cpermanently removed all\nhope of Plaintiff appealing directly to his sentencing judge.\u201d (/d. at 7) Plaintiff states\nthat the missing documents prove that his current sentence is incorrect; and that Diaz\nviolated his right of access to the courts in violation of the First Amendment, deprived\nhim of his property in violation of the Fifth Amendment, subjected him to cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment when he called Plaintiff a fag\nin front of the inmate population and failed to attempt to protect Plaintiff from physical\nand sexual abuse from other inmates, and violated Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment\nrights due to discrimination based upon Plaintiff's sexual preference. (/d. at 7-8)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendant grievance officer Lt. Dean Blade conspired with\nCalloway and Diaz to cover-up his subordinates\u2019 misconduct and constitutional\nviolations, because every grievance and complaint Plaintiff submitted was dismissed for\n\u201cno evidence supports grievant's complaint\u201d regardless of the evidence. According to\nPlaintiff, Blade\u2019s investigation found no violations despite Plaintiff's evidence to the\ncontrary and Blade conducted \u201csham\u201d reviews in his official capacity as grievance\nchairperson. (ld. at 8-9) Plaintiff alleges that Blade violated his right to access the\n\ncourts and right to equal protection. (/d. at 9)\nWith regard to the events at SCI from February 3, 2020 to August 5, 2020,\nPlaintiff alleges that he wrote to Defendant SCI Warden Truman Mears on numerous\noccasions about every incident described in the Complaint. (/d. at 9) Plaintiff alleges\nthat Mears failed to act in his official capacity as warden to resolve the constitutional\nviolations and failed to do anything \u201cexcept [to] inform [the] grievance officer to award\nplaintiff a portion of said loss [sic] property, but not to include legal paperwork. He\ndeclined to address that issue.\u201d (/d.) Plaintiff alleges that he wrote a \u201cmultitude of\n\nya\n\ncomplaints\u201d to Mears about Diaz\u2019s and Blade\u2019s conduct, and that Mears\u2019 \u201cinaction\u201d could\nstate a viable claim that Mears violated his rights under the Fourth and Eighth\nAmendments because he knew of a widespread history of abuse and failed to act. (/d.\nat 9-10) With regard to the July 2020 incidents, Plaintiff alleges that Mears was notified\nof his grievances, \u201cfailed to remedy the situation, and could be held responsible as\noverseer\u201d of SCI. (D.I. 10 at 9)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Mears is also the warden at JTVCC. (D.I. 10 at 9) The\nCourt takes judicial notice that the official web-site for the Delaware Department of\nCorrection states that Robert May is the current warden at JTVCC and that Mears is the\ncurrent warden at SCI. See https://doc.delaware.gov/views/facilities.blade.shtml (last\nvisited Apr. 4, 2022). Plaintiff alleges that in Mears\u2019 role at JTVCC, Mears failed to\ncorrect or remedy Plaintiff's grievances and encouraged the continuation of retaliatory\npractices against him. (D.I. 10 at 11) He alleges the retaliatory conduct consisted of\nbeing housed in SHU for over a year after he submitted numerous grievances seeking\nredress of his complaints. (/d. at 12)\n\nPlaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as well as nominal, compensatory,\n\nand punitive damages.\nIll. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A\\(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison\nconditions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\n\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\n\n6\ndeciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d\nCir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to\namend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v.\nMayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u2019 or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\n\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine\nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v.\nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that\nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Eleventh Amendment\n\nPlaintiff raises claims against Defendants in their individual and official\ncapacities. The Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution protects an\nunconsenting state or state agency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its own\ncitizens, regardless of the relief sought. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S.\n44, 54 (1996); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984);\nEdelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). \u201cA suit against a state official in his or her\nofficial capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official's\noffice. As such, it is no different from a suit against the State itself.\u201d Will v. Michigan\nDep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) (internal citations omitted); Ali v Howard,\n353 F. App\u2019x 667, 672 (3d Cir. 2009). The \u00a7 1983 claims seeking monetary damages\nagainst Defendant state officials in their official capacities are barred by the Eleventh\n\nAmendment. See id.\nThe State of Delaware has neither consented to Plaintiff's suit nor waived its\nimmunity. Therefore, the claims against Defendants in their official capacities seeking\nmonetary damages will be dismissed.\n\nB. Claims Against Warden Mears\n\nPlaintiff appears to raise claims against Mears based upon his supervisory\nposition as SCI Warden. He alleges that he wrote to Mears on numerous occasions\nabout each alleged incident that occurred from February 3 to August 5, 2020 and\nreceived no response. He alleges that numerous complaints were made to Mears\nabout the conduct of Diaz and Blade, and nothing was done. He alleges that Mears\nwas notified of his grievances concerning the July 2020 incidents and, as overseer of\nSCI, Mears failed to remedy the situation. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Mears, when\nacting as JTVCC warden, encouraged continued retaliatory practices against Plaintiff.\n\nPlaintiff does not indicate when he wrote to Mears. Nor does the Complaint\nindicate if Plaintiff or someone else was the person who made the numerous complaints\nto Mears about Diaz and Blade, or when the complaints were made. In addition, the\nwarden\u2019s participation in the after-the-fact review of grievances or letters is not enough\nto establish personal involvement as required for claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See\ne.g., Davis v. Correctional Med. Services, 436 F. App\u2019x 52 (3d Cir. 2011) (affirming\ndismissal of claim that prison official who did not respond to a letter written by inmate\nfailed to allege a constitutional violation); Brooks v. Beard, 167 F. App\u2019x 923, 925 (3d\nCir. 2006) (allegations that prison officials and administrators responded inappropriately\n\nto inmate\u2019s later-filed grievances do not establish the involvement of those officials and\nadministrators in the underlying deprivation). The warden\u2019s failure to respond to\nPlaintiff's letters or grievances does not state a constitutional claim.\n\nFinally, it is well-established that there is no respondeat superior liability under \u00a7\n1983. See Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016). Here, Plaintiffs vague\nand conclusory allegations do not suffice to impose liability upon the warden. See\nBaraka v. McGreevey, 481 F.3d 187, 210 (3d Cir. 2007) (defendant in a civil rights\naction \u201ccannot be held responsible for a constitutional violation which he [ ] neither\nparticipated in nor approved\u201d; personal involvement in the alleged wrong is required.)\n\nMears will be dismissed as a defendant for the reasons discussed.\n\nCc. Fourteenth Amendment\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Calloway violated his right to Equal Protection by not\naffording him the same rights as other inmates because Plaintiff is homosexual, that\nDiaz violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights due to discrimination based upon\nPlaintiff's sexual preference, and that Blade violated his right to equal protection.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not explicitly recognized sexual orientation as a suspect\nclass, and federal courts across the country have declined to identify homosexuals as a\nprotected class. See Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987) (discussing criteria for\nsuspect or quasi-suspect classification); San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez,\n411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973) (same). See also Price-Cornelison v. Brooks, 524 F.3d 1103,\n1113 n.9 (10th Cir. 2008) (collecting cases). Here, Plaintiff does not plead that he was\ntreated differently from similarly situated individuals. See Fletcher v. Phelps, 5 F. Supp.\n3d 655, (D. Del. 2013, aff'd, 639 F. App'x 85, 88 (3d Cir. 2015) (affirming dismissal of\n\ninmate\u2019s equal protection claim on grounds that homosexuals are not a suspect class or\n\n10\nprotected class for equal protection purposes); Williams v. Wetzel, 2020 WL 583983, at\n*14-15 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 6, 2020), aff'd, 827 F. App\u2019x 158 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Smith v.\nMazvekiewicz, 2010 WL 3191894, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 11, 2010) (Sexual orientation,\nhowever, is not a suspect classification, and courts \u201chave declined to identify\nhomosexuals as a protected class\u201d) and Sherrill v. City of Hoboken, 2020 WL 64617, at\n*7 (D.N.J. Jan. 6, 2020) (noting that \u201csexual orientation has not been recognized as a\nprotected class under federal law\u2019).\n\nIn addition, no matter how offensive and derogatory the language that any of the\nthree Defendants allegedly used with respect to Plaintiff's sexual orientation, that alone\ndoes not give rise to a constitutional claim. See Aleem-xX v. Westcott, 347 F. App\u2019x 731\n(3d Cir. 2009) (verbal abuse of a prisoner, even of the lewd variety, is not actionable\nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983).\n\nPlaintiff fails to plead a facially plausible equal protection claim. Therefore, the\nCourt will dismiss the equal protection claims raised against Calloway, Diaz, and Blade\nas frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\n\nD. Eighth Amendment\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Calloway violated the Eighth Amendment by subjecting him\nto physical and sexual abuse from general population inmates, that Diaz failed to\nattempt to protect Plaintiff from physical or sexual abuse from other inmates, and that\nDiaz used excessive force when he pepper-sprayed Plaintiff in the face, slammed\nPlaintiff to the ground, and dragged him off the tier.\n\nThe Court will dismiss the failure to protect claims. The Complaint does not\n\nallege that Plaintiff was actually physically and sexually abused by general population\n\n11\ninmates or other inmates or contain any facts to support a failure to protect claim.\nInstead, the claim is pled in a conclusory manner.\n\nPlaintiff has alleged what appears to be a non-frivolous excessive force claim\nagainst Diaz and he may proceed with that claim.\n\nE. First Amendment\n\nPlaintiff states (1) that his property was packed up by Diaz; (2) that although\nsome of his property was returned to him, his legal documents that prove his current\nsentence is incorrect were not; and (3) that Diaz\u2019s acts violated Plaintiffs right of access\nto the courts in violation of the First Amendment.*\n\nPrisoners must be allowed \u201cadequate, effective and meaningful\u201d access to the\ncourts. Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 822 (1977) (holding that prisons must give\ninmates access to law libraries or direct legal assistance). \u201cMany courts have found a\ncause of action for violation of the right of access stated where it was alleged that prison\nofficials confiscated and/or destroyed legal materials.\u201d Zilich v. Lucht, 981 F.2d 694,\n695 (3d Cir. 1992) (citations omitted). The Court liberally construes the allegations and\nwill allow Plaintiff to proceed against Diaz on the access to the courts claim.\n\nF. Fifth Amendment\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Diaz deprived him of his property in violation of the Fifth\n\nAmendment. A due process claim based on the deprivation of his personal property is\n\n4 Throughout the Complaint Plaintiff alleges retaliation by various defendants. However,\nthe retaliation claims as pled are conclusory and are not cognizable. See Watson v.\nRozum, 834 F.3d 417, 420 (3d Cir. 2016) (to establish a retaliation claim Plaintiff must\nallege that: (1) his conduct was constitutionally protected; (2) he suffered an adverse\naction at the hands of prison officials; and (3) his constitutionally protected activity was a\nsubstantial or motivating factor in the decision to discipline him).\n\n12\nnot actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 unless there is no adequate post deprivation\nremedy available. See Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 542 (1981), overruled on other\ngrounds by 474 U.S. 327 (1986)); Harris v. McMullen, 609 F. App\u2019x 704, 705 (3d Cir.\n2015). Because Delaware provides an adequate remedy by filing a common law claim\nfor conversion of property, Plaintiff cannot maintain a cause of action pursuant to\n\u00a7 1983. Harris, 609 F. App\u2019x at 705. The claim will be dismissed.\n\nG. Grievance Process\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Blade conspired with Calloway and Diaz to cover-up\nmisconduct and constitutional violations because every grievance and complaint\nPlaintiff submitted was dismissed and Blade conducted sham reviews in his role as\ngrievance chairperson. The filing of prison grievances is a constitutionally protected\nactivity. Robinson v. Taylor, 204 F. App\u2019x 155, 157 (3d Cir. 2006). To the extent that\nPlaintiff bases his claims upon his dissatisfaction with the grievance procedure or denial\nof his grievances, the claims fail because an inmate does not have a \u201cfree-standing\nconstitutionally right to an effective grievance process.\u201d Woods v. First Corr. Med., Inc.,\n446 F. App\u2019x 400, 403 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Flick v. Alba, 932 F.2d 728, 729 (8th Cir.\n1991)). Notably, the denial of grievance appeals does not in itself give rise to a\nconstitutional claim as Plaintiff is free to bring a civil rights claim in District Court. Winn\nv. Department of Corr., 340 F. App\u2019x 757, 759 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing Flick v. Alba, 932\nF.2d 728, 729 (8'\" Cir. 1991).\n\nPlaintiff cannot maintain a constitutional claim based upon his perception that his\n\ngrievances were not properly processed, that they were denied, or that the grievance\n\n13\nprocess is inadequate. Therefore, the Court will dismiss the claim as frivolous pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\n\nH. Conspiracy\n\nAs just discussed, Plaintiff alleges that Blade conspired with Calloway and Diaz\nto cover-up misconduct and constitutional violations because every grievance and\ncomplaint Plaintiff submitted was denied. It appears that Plaintiffs raises the conspiracy\nclaim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). The claim fails under either\nstatute.\n\nTo state a conspiracy claim under \u00a7 1983, Plaintiff must show that \u201cpersons\nacting under color of state law conspired to deprive him of a federally protected right.\u201d\nGannaway v. Berks Cty. Prison, 439 F. App\u2019x 86, 93 (3d Cir. 2011). \u201c[T]he linchpin for\nconspiracy is agreement.\u201d /d. (quoting Bailey v. Board of Cty. Cmm\u2019rs, 956 F.2d 1112,\n1122 (11th Cir. 1992). As discussed above, Plaintiff has no constitutional right to a\ngrievance procedure. In addition, Plaintiff alleges in a conclusory manner, without\nsupporting facts to show that there was an agreement, implicit or otherwise, to deprive\nPlaintiff of his federal rights.\n\nThe claim under \u00a7 1985(3) also fails. To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1985(3), a plaintiff must allege: \u201c(1) a conspiracy of two or more persons; (2) motivated\nby racial or class based discriminatory animus designed to deprive, directly or indirectly,\nany person or class of person to the equal protection of the laws; (3) an act in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy; and (4) an injury to person or property or to the\ndeprivation of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.\u201d Petrosian v.\n\nCollins, 479 F. App\u2019x 409, 410 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing Brown v. Philip Morris Inc., 250\n\n14\nF.3d 789, 805 (3d Cir. 2001). As discussed above, Plaintiff's sexual orientation is not a\nsuspect class or protected class for equal protection purposes. Nor does Plaintiff allege\na race-based discriminatory animus. Accordingly, the claim will be dismissed.\n\nI. Prison Policy/Procedure\n\nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that Calloway failed to follow institutional policy as it\npertains to \u201csmall homosexual individuals.\u201d These allegations do not rise to the level of\na constitutional violation.\n\n\u201cTo establish liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that the\ndefendants, acting under color of law, violated the plaintiffs federal constitutional or\nstatutory rights, and thereby caused the complained of injury.\u201d Elmore v. Cleary, 399\nF.3d 279, 281 (3d Cir. 2005). \u201c[Section] 1983 merely provides a mechanism for\nenforcing individual rights \u2018secured\u2019 elsewhere, i.e., rights independently \u2018secured by the\nConstitution and laws\u2019 of the United States.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285\n(2002). Federal and state regulations such as Delaware Department of Correction\npolicies do not give rise to a liberty interest. See Rambert v. Beard, 2012 WL 760619,\nat *13 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 7, 2012) (compiling cases and holding that \u201c[flederal and state\nregulations in and of themselves do not create a liberty interest\u201d in the disputed DOC\nprocedure at issue).\n\nHere, there are no allegations that housing policy in question is a provision in the\nConstitution or federal law. It is a policy of the Delaware Department of Correction.\nCalloway\u2019s alleged failure to follow the procedure for housing homosexuals is not in\n\nitself a violation subject to \u00a7 1983.\n\n15\nJ. Request for Counsel\n\nPlaintiff requests counsel on the grounds that he is unable to afford counsel; his\nimprisonment greatly limits his ability to litigate; the issues are complex and will require\nsignificant research and investigation; he has limited law library access and limited\nknowledge of the law; a trial will likely involve conflicting testimony and counsel will\nbetter enable Plaintiff to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses; and he has\nmade repeated attempts to retain counsel. (D.I. 11)\n\nA pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or statutory\nright to representation by counsel. See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d\nCir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993). However, representation\nby counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a finding that a\nplaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.\n\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of\nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in\ndeciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the\nmerits of the plaintiff's claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her case\nconsidering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon\nhim or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to\nwhich factual investigation is required and the plaintiffs ability to pursue such\n\ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiff's capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and\n\n5 See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of lowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989)\n(\u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7 1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling\nattorney to represent an indigent civil litigant, the operative word in the statute being\n\u201crequest.\u201d).\n\n16\n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony.\nSee Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at\n155-56. The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative. Tabron, 6 F.3d\nat 157.\n\nSeveral of the Tabron factors militate against granting Plaintiff's request for\ncounsel at this time. First, this case is in its early stages and no defendant has been\nserved. In addition, Plaintiff's filing indicates that he can ably represent himself and\npresent his claims. Also, contrary to Plaintiffs assertions, the issues are not complex.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny the request for counsel without prejudice to renew.\n\nK. Default Judgment\n\nPlaintiff has filed a motion for default judgment. (D.I. 12) The motion will be\ndenied. The parties have not been served, and there has been no entry of default. See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 55(a) and (b).\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiff's request for counsel\nwithout prejudice to renew (D.I. 11); (2) deny Plaintiff's motion for default judgment (D.I.\n12); (3) allow Plaintiff to proceed against Diaz on the excessive force and access to the\ncourts claims; and (4) dismiss all remaining Defendants and claims pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and 1915A\\(b)(1).\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\n17\n"}
