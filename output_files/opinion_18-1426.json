Andrews", "date": "01-28-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nRICKY THOMPSON-EL , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nGREATER DOVER BOYS AND GIRLS \nCLUB, \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 18-1426-RGA \nRicky Thompson -El, Wilmington , Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nKarine Sarkisian , Esquire, and Marc Stephen Casarino, Esquire, White & Williams, \nWilmington , Delaware ; Counsel for Defendants. \nJanuary 1$', 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION ~r. ,District udge: \nPlaintiff Ricky Thompson-El appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis. He commenced this employment discrimination action on \nSeptember 13, 2018. (0.1. 1). The operative pleading consists of Docket Items 1 and 8. \nBefore the Court are Plaintiff's motion to compel, motion for default judgment , and \nmotion for summary judgment and Defendant's motion to compel or, in the alternative , \nto dismiss. (D.I. 50, 63, 64, 69). \nMOTION TO COMPEL \nPlaintiff filed a motion to compel (D. I. 50) but does not indicate the discovery he \nseeks to compel nor does he take issue with any of Defendant's responses. Inasmuch \nas there is no discovery in dispute, the motion will be denied. \nMOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT \nPlaintiff seeks entry of default judgment on the grounds that Defendant failed to \nfile an answering brief by October 29, 2021. (D.I. 64). Defendant opposes. Entry of \ndefault judgment is a two-step process. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a), (b). A party seeking \nto obtain a default judgment must first request that the clerk of the court \"enter ... the \ndefault\" of the party that has not answered the pleading or \"otherwise defend[ed], \" within \nthe time required by the rules or as extended by court order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). \nHere, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss this matter on October 15, 2021. (D.I. \n63). The October 29, 2021 response to which Plaintiff refers is the due date for Plaintiff \nto file a response to Defendants ' motion to dismiss. Entry of default and/or default \njudgment is not appropriate . Therefore , the motion will be denied. \n1 MOTION TO DISMISS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, MOTION TO COMPEL \nDefendant moves to dismiss for failure to prosecute pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n41 (b) or, in the alternative , to compel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a) on the ground \nthat Plaintiff has failed to provide adequate responses to discovery requests. (0.1. 63). \nPlaintiff opposes. \nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41 (b), a court may dismiss an action \"[f]or failure of \nthe plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with [the Federal Rules] or any order of court .... \" \nAlthough dismissal is an extreme sanction that should only be used in limited \ncircumstances , dismissal is appropriate if a party fails to prosecute the action. See \nHarris v. City of Philadelphia, 47 F.3d 1311, 1330 (3d Cir. 1995). Dismissal \"must be a \nsanction of last, nor first resort.\" Pou/is v. State Farm Fire and Gas. Co., 747 F.2d 863, \n869 (3d Cir. 1984); \nThe Court should assess six factors to determine whether dismissal is warranted . \nHildebrand v. Allegheny Cty., 923 F.3d 128, 132 (3d Cir. 2019). The six factors are: (1) \nthe extent of the party's personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary \ncaused by the failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery ; \n(3) a history of dilatoriness ; (4) whether the conduct of the party was willful or in bad \nfaith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal , which entails an analysis of \nother sanctions ; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim or defense. See Pou/is v. \nState Farm Fire & Gas. Co., 747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir. 1984). The record must support \nthe District Court's findings on the six factors. Id. \n2 The Court must balance the factors and may dismiss the action even if all of \nthem do not weigh against Plaintiff. See Emerson v. Thiel Coll., 296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d \nCir. 2002). Because dismissal for failure to prosecute involves a factual inquiry, it can \nbe appropriate even if some of the Pou/is factors are not satisfied. See Hicks v. \nFeeney, 850 F.2d 152, 156 (3d Cir. 1998); Curtis T. Bedwell & Sons, Inc. v. \nInternational Fidelity Ins. Co., 843 F.2d 683, 696 (3d Cir. 1988). \"[C]ases should be \ndecided on the merits barring substantial circumstances in support of the contrary \noutcome. \" Hildebrand, 923 F.3d at 132. If the case is close, \"doubts should be \nresolved in favor of reaching a decision on the merits.\" Id. \nThe record reflects that Defendant served Plaintiff with interrogatories and \nrequests for production of documents on June 9, 2021. (D.I. 38, 48). On July 29, 2021, \nPlaintiff filed blanket objections to the discovery requests on various grounds: \nTthe documents ... asked for is irrelevant to the subject-matter ... I want \nher [i.e., counsel for Defendant] to send me the same documents that she \nasked me for ... I feel very uncomfortable with her asking me for these \ndocuments . She feels and acts like an Outlaw, and I need for her to show \nme the Rule 26 of FRCP where these documents are applicable .... I \nalso need the following documents from her, and she cannot object, \nbecause this Rule of Law1 A Public Policy, Administrative Law. I need for \nher to provide for me her Registration Statement pursuant to 22 US Code \n612. \n(D.I. 51 at 2). On September 13, 2021, Defendant corresponded with Plaintiff and \nrequested complete answers to the discovery requests and enclosed duplicate copies of \nthe discovery requests. (D.I. 60). Plaintiffs discovery response , filed September 22, \n2021, states that the discovery requests are \"tedious\" and \"unintelligible .\" (D.I. 61 ). In \n3 turn, Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute , or, in the \nalternative motion to compel. (0.1. 63). \nI have considered the Pou/is factors and find that dismissal of Plaintiff's claims is \nnot warranted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41 (b). Plaintiff, however, will be ordered to \nprovide complete answers to the discovery request Defendant served upon him \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37. \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26, the Parties to this action may \nobtain discovery regarding : \n[A]ny nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense \nand proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of \nthe issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy , the parties' \nrelative access to relevant information , the parties' resources, the \nimportance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the \nburden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. \nInformation within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in \nevidence to be discoverable . \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Pursuant to Rule 37, a party who has received incomplete \nanswers to discovery requests may move for an order compelling discovery . Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 37(a)(1 ), (4). A party moving to compel discovery bears the initial burden of \nestablishing the relevance of the requested information . Morrison v. Phi/a. Haus. Auth., \n203 F.R.D. 195, 196 (E.D. Pa. 2001 ). The burden then shifts to the party resisting \ndisclosure to show that \"the requested discovery (1) does not come within the broad \nscope of relevance as defined under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), or (2) is of such marginal \nrelevance that the potential harm occasioned by discovery would outweigh the ordinary \npresumption in favor of broad disclosure .\" First Seaford Sur. v. Durkin & Devries Ins. \n4 Agency, 918 F. Supp. 2d 362, 383 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (citing McConnell v. Canadian Pac. \nRealty Co., 280 F.R.D. 188, 193 (M.D. Pa. 2011 )). \nBased on the submissions of the parties, the Court finds Plaintiff non-compliant \nwith Fed. R. Civ. P. 26. His global objections are not well-taken and there are no \nspecific objections to any particular interrogatory or request to produce documents .1 \nTherefore, the motion to compel will be granted. Plaintiff is warned that his failure to \ncompletely and adequately respond to the discovery requests could result in sanctions . \nMOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPlaintiff alleges age discrimination resulted in his termination of employment by \nDefendant. (D.I. 1, 8, 12). He moves for summary judgment on the ground that there \nare no issues that support Defendant's allegations. (D.I. 69). Defendant opposes. \n\"Summary judgment is proper when, viewing the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all inferences in favor of that party, there \nis no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.\" Drumgo v. Kuschel, 811 F. App'x 115, 117 (3d Cir. 2020) \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). A fact in dispute is material when it \"might affect the \noutcome of the suit under the governing law\" and is genuine \"if the evidence is such that \na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \"In considering a motion for summary judgment , \n1 I reviewed the interrogatories . (D.I. 60-1). While not all of them are as clearly written as they could be, \nit is clear that many of them are generally relevant to Plaintiffs employment discrimination case and his \nclaim of damages . They may be \"tedious,\" but they are not unintelligible , and it appears that Plaintiff has \na Bachelor's Degree (D.I. 72 at 9 of 19) and a \"Master of Science in Public Administration \" (D.I. 22 at 5; \n0.1. 72 at 12 of 19) and should therefore be able to answer most or all of them. I also reviewed the \nrequests for documents . (D. I. 60-2). Again, most of them appear to be relevant and not that difficult to \nunderstand . \n5 a district court may not make credibility determinations or engage in any weighing of the \nevidence ; instead, the nonmoving party's evidence 'is to be believed and all justifiable \ninferences are to be drawn in his favor.\"' Marino v. Indus. Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, \n247 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Anderson , 477 U.S. at 255). A court's role in deciding a \nmotion for summary judgment is not to evaluate the evidence and decide the truth of the \nmatter but rather \"to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Anderson , 477 \nU.S. at 249. \nA party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing the basis \nfor its motion and must demonstrate that there is an absence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). The burden then \nshifts to the nonmoving party to show that there is a \"genuine issue for trial.\" Id. at 324. \nTo withstand a properly supported motion for summary judgment , the nonmoving party \nmust identify specific facts and affirmative evidence that contradict the moving party. \nAnderson , 477 U.S. at 250. \nThere is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact\" if a party\" \"fails to make a \nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's \ncase.\" Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. \"If reasonable minds could differ as to the \nimport of the evidence ,\" however, summary judgment is not appropriate . See \nAnderson , 477 U.S. at 250-51. \nDefendant opposes the motion on the ground that Plaintiffs motion fails to cite to \nor show any evidence that satisfies the elements of a prima case of age discrimination. \nIn the alternative , it argues that had Plaintiff made a prima case of age discrimination it \n6 has provided significant and non-discriminatory evidence that Plaintiffs termination of \nemployment was not motivated by his age. \nFederal law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, \nsex, national origin, age, and disability. See E.E.O.C. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 778 F.3d 444, \n448-49 (3d Cir. 2015). Disparate treatment claims brought under the Age Discrimination \nin Employment Act of 1967, as amended , 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621, et seq. are analyzed under \nthe burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973). \"[A]n employee must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination , after \nwhich the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate , nondiscriminatory \nreason for its adverse employment decision.\" Fasold v. Justice, 409 F.3d 178, 184 (3d \nCir. 2005). If the defendant meets this burden, then the burden shifts back to the \nplaintiff to present \"some evidence, direct or circumstantial , from which a factfinder \ncould reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer 's articulated legitimate reasons; or \n(2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely that not a motivating \nor determinative cause of the employer 's action.\" Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 \n(3d Cir. 1994). While the burden of production may shift, the ultimate burden of \npersuading the trier of fact that the employer intentionally discriminated against the \nemployee remains at all times with the employee . See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, \n509 U.S. 502, 511 (1993). \nFor a prima facie case of age discrimination , a plaintiff must establish that: \"(1) \nhe is over forty, (2) he is qualified for the position in question, (3) he suffered from an \nadverse employment decision , and (4) his replacement was sufficiently younger to \n7 permit a reasonable inference of age discrimination. \" Hill v. Borough of Kutztown , 455 \nF.3d 225, 247 (3d Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted). Plaintiff has not established a prima \nfacie case of age discrimination . While Plaintiff meets two elements of a prima facie \ncase (i.e., his age and an adverse employment decision) , the record evidence does not \nsupport a finding that Plaintiff was qualified for the position or that his replacement was \nsufficiently younger to permit a reasonable inference of age discrimination . (See 0.1. 1-\n1, 12). Notably, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment does not address age \ndiscrimination and does not provide any evidence to support an age discrimination \nclaim. \nEven assuming, arguendo , that Plaintiff did establish a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination , Defendant has articulated a legitimate , nondiscriminatory reason for \nterminating Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff had a well-documented and longstanding \npoor performance history. (See 0.1. 71-1 at Ex. B, C, D, E showing evidence that \nPlaintiff was dismissed as a lifeguard because he did not have the skill to perform the \nposition). Once Defendant proffered a legitimate , nondiscriminatory reason, the burden \nshifted to Plaintiff to establish that Defendant's proffered reason was truly pretext for \ndiscrimination based upon his age. Plaintiff's motion and submissions fail to meet this \nburden. (See 0.1. 72, 73). \nPlaintiff produced no evidence that Defendant's proffered reason is subject to \nsuch weaknesses and implausibilities sufficient \"to satisfy the factfinder that \n[Defendant 's] actions could not have been for nondiscriminatory reasons.\" Willis v. \nUPMC Children's Hosp. of Pittsburgh , 808 F.3d 638, 644-45 (3d Cir. 2015). Nor has he \n8 pointed to evidence leading a factfinder to reasonably believe that a discriminatory \nreason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative factor in his termination . \nId. at 645. There is no record evidence that shows that Defendant's reason for \nterminating Plaintiff's employment was pretext for age discrimination . Therefore , \nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment will be denied. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiff's motion to compel; (2) \ndeny Defendant 's motion to dismiss and grant its motion to compel; (3) deny Plaintiffs \nmotion for default judgment ; (4) deny Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment ; and (5) \nextend the case dispositive motions deadline (see D.I. 68). \nAn appropriate Order follows. \n9 "}
