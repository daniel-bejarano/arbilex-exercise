(Yogi Krupa) filed the \nComplaint (D.I. 1) against Defendants GLeS, Inc. (GLeS), Primo Properties, LLC \n(Primo), and GPM Investments , Inc. (GPM). Yogi Krupa sought a temporary \nrestraining order (TRO), a preliminary and a permanent injunction, declaratory \nrelief, and damages under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2801 et seq. (the PMPA). D.I. 1 at 12. I granted a TRO as to only GPM on \nFebruary 25, 2022, D.I. 12, and I subsequently denied a preliminary injunction as \nto all Defendants during a March 16, 2022, hearing. D.I. 25 ,r 3. The TRO expired \non March 31, 2022. D.I. 25 at 2. Before me now is Defendants GLeS's and \nPrimo' s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. D .I. 21. I will grant the Motion \nbecause the PMP A only authorizes civil actions against a franchisor, and neither \nGLeS nor Primo are Yogi Krupa's franchisor. \nI. BACKGROUND 1 \nIn 2005, GLeS entered a franchise agreement (the First Agreement) with \nTri-State Oil whereby GLeS leased a \"BP\" branded motor fuel station in Dover, \n1 When assessing the merits of a Rule 12(b )( 6) motion to dismiss, I accept as true \nall factual allegations in the Complaint and view those facts in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff. See Fed. Trade Comm 'n v. AbbVie Inc, 976 F.3d 327, \n351 (3d Cir. 2020); Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Delaware (the Station) to and sold motor fuel (for resale to the public) to Tri-State \nOil. D.I. 5-3 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 5(c); D.I. 1 ,r 4. In 2006, Yogi Krupa's predecessor-in\u00ad\ninterest, Yogi Corporation (Yogi Corp.), purchased from Tri-State Oil the right to \ntake its place in the First Agreement. D.I. 1 ,r 4, 1 O; 5-2 \u00a7 2; D.I. 28 at 9. GLeS \nthereinafter leased the Station to and sold motor fuel to Yogi Corp. D.I. 1 ,r 7; D.I. \n5-4 \u00a7 3 7. Under the PMP A, the right to lease a motor fuel station, use a trademark, \nand acquire motor fuel for resale is a \"franchise,\" Yogi Corp. was the \"franchisee,\" \nand GLeS was the \"franchisor.\" D.I. 1 ,I 7; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(1), (3), (4). \nOn February 23, 2007, GPM acquired the right to lease the Station and 27 \nsimilar properties from Primo and GLeS-the owners of the underlying \npremises-for 15 years pursuant to a Master Lease Agreement, D.I. 5-6 (the \nMaster Lease). D.I. 1 ,r,r 13-14. GPM also inherited the First Agreement from \nGLeS. D.I. 5-4 \u00a7 37; D.I. 1 ,r 8. The Master Lease was set to terminate on \nFebruary 28, 2022, but it gave GPM the right to renew for \"[u]p to three (3) \nsuccessive additional periods of five ( 5) years each ... upon ... one ( 1) year prior \nwritten notice prior to the expiration of the initial fifteen (15) year Term .... \" \nD.I. 1 ,I,I 14-15; D.I. 5-6 at 4. It also gave GPM a \"right of first refusal (the \n'ROFR') to purchase the Premises\" and gave GPM the right to \"freely assign ... \nany or all of its rights, title and interest in and to\" the Master Lease \"without \n2 Landlord's prior written consent or approval .... \" D.I. 5-6 \u00a7\u00a7 18(n), 20(a)(3); D.I. \n1 ,r,r 18-19. \nIn June 2011, GPM and Yogi Krupa (now substituted for Yogi Corp.) opted \nto replace the First Agreement. D.I. 5-4 \u00a7 37; D.I. 17-4 \u00a7 20. GPM agreed to lease \nthe Station to and distribute motor fuel to Yogi Krupa under a new Sublease \nAgreement, D.I. 5-4, and a new Supply Agreement, D.I. 17-4. D.I. 1 ,r,r 10-12. \nThe Sublease Agreement was set to end on May 31, 2021, or with the termination \nof the Master Lease, and it was \"subject and subordinate to, in all respects, [] the \nterms and conditions of Master Lease.\" D.I. 5-4 \u00a7\u00a7 2(a), 22(a); D.I. 1 ,r 20. \nThe parties functioned under the Master Lease and the Sublease Agreement \nwithout incident until March 2021, when GPM failed to exercise its option to \nrenew the Master Lease. D.I. 1 ,r 23. In a letter dated March 22, 2021, GPM \noffered to extend Yogi Krupa' s lease through December 31, 2021, and added that, \n[ d]uring the Extension Period [May 31 through December \n31], GPM shall pursue an extension of GPM's master \nlease of the Premises. If GPM is successful in extending \nGPM's master lease at the Premises, GPM and [Yogi \nKrupa] may negotiate a further extension of the Sublease \nand Supply Agreement[s] on mutually agreeable terms. \nHowever, in the event GPM is unsuccessful in extending \nthe term of the master lease, this letter will serve as 90-\ndays' notice to [Yogi Krupa] of GPM' s intent not to renew \nthe [the Sublease Agreement and the Supply] Agreement, \nwhich shall then expire on December 31, 2021. \nD.I. 5-7; D.I. I ,r 22. Yogi Krupa apparently agreed to the extension. \n3 In a letter dated August 31, 2021, GPM informed Yogi Krupa that, \n[p ]ursuant to the terms of the Sublease and Supply \nAgreement[s], the term[s] of the Sublease and [Supply] \nAgreement[ s] shall expire on December 31, 2021. \nThe Master Lease between [GLeS] and [Primo] ... and \nGPM relating to the [Station] is terminating and will not \nrenew. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 2 of the \nSublease, the Sublease shall terminate on December 31, \n2021 and not renew. The Supply Agreement shall also \nterminate on December 31, 2021. \nShould Sub lessee [i.e., Yogi Krupa] desire to continue \nleasing the Premises, Sublessee may contact [GLeS and \nPrimo] directly to discuss the possibility of a direct lease \nbetween [GLeS and Primo] and Sublessee. Sublessee may \ncontact Mark Greco of [Primo] at [phone] or [email]. \nTo the extent any franchise relationship exists between \nSublessee and GPM, a copy of the summary statement \ndescribed in section 104(d) {15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804(d)} of the \nPMP A is attached hereto as Exhibit A .... \nD.I. 5-8 (bold and curly brackets in original); D.I. 1 ,r 24. By agreement dated \nDecember 6, 2021, GPM extended the Sublease Agreement to February 28, 2022, \nthe last day of GPM's Master Lease with Primo/GLeS. D.I. 5-11; D.I. 1 ,r 35. \nYogi Krupa met in person with Primo' s Mark Greco on September 21, 2021, \nand Greco told Yogi Krupa that Primo and GLeS would entertain an offer to \npurchase the Station outright. In October 2021, Yogi Krupa offered to purchase \nthe Station for $2.1 million. D.I. 1 ,r,r 28-29; D.I. 5-9 at 2. On November 10, \n2021, Greco emailed Himanshu Patel of Yogi Krupa that a third party-later \n4 identified as Carroll Independent Fuel, LLC (Carroll)-had made a \"substantially \nhigher\" offer to purchase the Station. D.I. 5-9 at 5--6; D.I. 1 ,r 30. Greco added \nthat, \"[i]f we proceed with the sale, they [i.e., Carroll] have told us that they will \nmeet with you to discuss an offer for you to stay in the location\" and that \"[Carroll] \nrecognize[ s] that you and the other dealers [i.e., franchisees] have been operating \nthe business for several years and they are willing to meet with each of you in \nhopes of reaching agreements to continue your operations.\" D.I. 5-9 at 5--6; D.I. 1 \n,r 30. Yogi Krupa increased its offer to $2.5 million on November 10, 2021. D.I. \n5-9 at 7; D.I. 1 ,r 29. But, in an email to Patel on November 22, 2021, Greco \ndeclined Yogi Krupa's offer. D.I. 5-10 at 2-3; D.I. 1 ,r 31. Instead, Greco wrote \nthat Carroll would visit the six motor fuel stations it was about to purchase and \nasked Patel to \"[p]lease make sure everything is in good working order and your \nstaff is standing tall and offering excellent customer service so they make a good \nimpression\"; Greco added that \"I discussed with them that you live in New Jersey \nand operate in Delaware and they are interested in speaking with you about the \npossible operation of other locations where they may have opportunities for long \ntime operators like yourself.\" D.I. 5-10 at 2-3; D.I. 1 ,r,r 31, 34. Yogi Krupa met \nwith Carroll in December 2021; but, on February 1, 2022, \"Jay Tan of Carroll \ninformed Yogi Krupa for the first time that Carroll was not going to provide Yogi \n5 Krupa with a new lease and Carroll was going to company operate the [S]tation.\" \nD.I. 1 ,r,r 34, 36. This action ensued. \nYogi Krupa's Complaint alleges that Primo and GLeS \nviolated, directly or indirectly, the PMP A when they \nfailed to provide Yogi Krupa with an opportunity to \nrenew its franchise relationship at to [sic] the Station [] \ndue to their entering into an Agreement of Sale with \nCarroll to sell the Station [] knowing that Yogi Krupa \nhad not been offered an assignment of the ROFR that \nGPM had under the Master Lease. \nD.I. 1 ,r 43. Yogi Krupa brought further allegations against GPM. D.I. 1 ,r 42. \nOn the same day that Yogi Krupa filed its Complaint, D.I. 1, Yogi Krupa \nfiled a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, D.I. 4, \nthat sought to prohibit Defendants from \"taking any action to terminate or \nnonrenew [Yogi Krupa' s] franchise\" and sought to keep the Sublease Agreement \nand the Supply Agreement in place, D.I. 5-16 at 3. On February 25, 2022, I held a \nthree-hour teleconference hearing with the parties, D.I. 32, and I granted a TRO \nonly as to GPM, D.I. 12. On March 16, 2022, I held a four-and-a-half hour hearing \nwith the parties. D.I. 31. At the conclusion of that hearing, I denied Yogi Krupa' s \nMotion for a Preliminary Injunction; I extended the TRO until March 22, 2022; \nand I asked the parties to provide a joint proposed order that would permit Yogi \nKrupa to vacate the Station on a reasonable timeline. D.I. 31 at 120, 127-28. \n6 Pursuant to my March 23, 2022, Order, the TRO expired on March 31, 2022. D.I. \n25 at 2. \nIn connection with the TRO and preliminary injunction hearings and \nmotions, both Yogi Krupa and Defendants provided other documentation and \nfactual allegations. See, e.g., D.I. 5-1; D.I. 16. I consider those facts and \ndocuments here only if the Complaint references the document in question. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a \nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the \ncomplaint must include more than mere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic \nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 555 (2007) ( citation omitted). The complaint must set forth enough \nfacts, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Id. at \n570. A claim is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ( citation \nomitted). Deciding whether a claim is plausible is a \"context-specific task that \nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" \nId. at 679 ( citation omitted). \n7 When considering a Rule 12(b )( 6) motion to dismiss, the court must accept \nall factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most \nfavorable to plaintiffs. Umland, 542 F .3d at 64. I may consider matters of public \nrecord and documents attached to, \"integral to[,] or explicitly relied upon in\" the \ncomplaint. Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241,249 (3d Cir. 2014) (cleaned up); see \nalso Spizzirri v. Zyla Life Scis., 802 F. App'x 738, 739 (3d Cir. 2020) (same). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nThe PMPA prohibits a franchisor from refusing to renew a franchisee's lease \nof a motor fuel station, save on specified grounds. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802. A franchisee \nmay enforce that prohibition via a civil action in federal court against its \nfranchisor. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(a). At issue here is whether the PMPA provides a \ncause of action against a franchisor's landlord. Consistent with binding precedent, \nI find that it does not and will, therefore, dismiss Yogi Krupa' s claims against \nGLeS and Primo. \nYogi Krupa's Complaint alleges that GLeS and Primo violated the PMPA \nwhen GLeS and Primo sold the Station to Carroll and did not permit Yogi Krupa to \nrenew its franchise. D.I. 1 ,r 43. GLeS and Primo argue that I should dismiss the \nallegations against them because the PMP A does not apply to the relationship \nbetween GLeS/Primo and Yogi Krupa and that, even if it did, the claims fall \noutside the P:MPA's statute of limitations. D.I. 22 at 2-3. Yogi Krupa responds \n8 that its claims arise not from the First Agreement alone, but from both the GLeS\u00ad\nY ogi Krupa franchise relationship that began in 2006, D.I. 28 at 2, 8, and Yogi \nKrupa's status as an \"intended third-party beneficiary\" of the Master Lease, D.I. 28 \nat 9. \nA. The PMPA's Structure \nParties are generally free to establish the bases for nonrenewal or \ntermination of their contracts. But the P:MP A limits termination or nonrenewal of \na motor fuel franchise to specified grounds and permits franchisees to bring causes \nof action against franchisors for failure to renew the franchise relationship. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2802, 2805. But \"the application of the PMP A is limited to causes of \naction arising between franchisees and franchisors engaged in the petroleum \nmarketing field.\" Patel v. Sun Co. (\"Patel V\"), 63 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 1995). \nThe PMP A's definitions set the statute's scope. A franchise governs the \nrelationship between a franchisee and franchisor. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(1), (2). \"(A] \n'franchise' is defined as 'any contract' that (1] authorizes a franchisee to use the \nfranchisor's trademark, as well as any associated agreement [2] providing for the \nsupply of motor fuel or [3] authorizing the franchisee to occupy a service station \nowned by the franchisor.\" Mac's Shell Serv., Inc. v. Shell Oil Prod. Co. LLC, 559 \nU.S. 175, 178-79 (2010) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(1)(A)) (footnote omitted). A \nfranchisee is \"a retailer or distributor ... who is authorized or permitted, under a \n9 franchise, to use a trademark in connection with the ... distribution of motor fuel.\" \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(4). Similarly, a franchisor is \"a refiner or distributor ... who \nauthorizes or permits, under a franchise, a retailer or distributor to use a trademark \nin connection with the ... distribution of motor fuel.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(3). A \ndistributor \"purchases motor fuel for ... distribution to another\" and includes the \ndistributor's affiliates. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(6). And a retailer \"purchases motor fuel \nfor sale to the general public for ultimate consumption.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(7). \nRefiners, which refine crude oil, are not relevant here. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(5). \nThe PMP A permits a franchisee to \"maintain a civil action\" against a \nfranchisor under three sections, but two sections-\u00a7 2803 (related to trial \nfranchises) and \u00a7 2807 (related to renewable fuel pumps )-are not relevant here. \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(a). Section 2802 prohibits a franchisor from \"fail[ing] to renew \nany franchise relationship\" unless \"such nonrenewal is based upon a ground \ndescribed in[\u00a7 2802 of the PMPA].\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2802(a) and (b)(l)(B). A \nfranchisee must bring an action within one year of the date that either the franchise \nis terminated or the franchisor fails to comply with\u00a7 2802. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(a). \nB. The PMPA's Applicability to GLeS and Primo \nYogi Krupa argues that the PMP A applies to GLeS and Primo on two \ngrounds: First, GLeS and Yogi Krupa had a franchise relationship that began in \n2006 and persisted until 2022, and Primo is an affiliate of GLeS. D.I. 29 at 8. \n10 Second, Yogi Krupa is an \"intended third-party beneficiary of the Master Lease.\" \nD.I. 29 at 9. But Yogi Krupa's Complaint does not support the first argument, and \nthe second argument, even if true, would not expand the PMPA's reach to include \nPrimo and GLeS. Instead, the PMP A only permits an action by a franchisee \nagainst a franchisor. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2802(a), 2805(a). \nThe Complaint does not support Yogi Krupa's argument that GLeS and \nYogi Krupa had a franchise relationship from 2006 until 2022. A franchise is a \ncontract whereby, in connection with the use of a trademark, a franchisor leases a \nmotor fuel station to or supplies motor fuel to a franchisee. Mac's Shell, 559 U.S. \nat 178-79. And a \"franchise relationship\" only concerns obligations \"under a \nfranchise.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(2). GLeS was the franchisor for Yogi Corp. in 2006, \nsince GLeS both leased the Station to and sold motor fuel to Yogi Corp. in \nconnection with the \"BP\" trademark. D.I. 1 ,r 7. But, on June 1, 2011, GPM and \nYogi Krupa signed a Supply Agreement that replaced the parties' prior agreement, \nmade GPM Yogi Krupa' s \"exclusive supplier of [branded gasoline, diesel fuel, and \nkerosene][,]\" and prohibited Yogi Krupa from selling fuel branded under any other \ntrademark. D.I. 17-4 \u00a7\u00a7 l(a), 4, 20; D.I. 1 ,r 11. On the same date, GPM and Yogi \nKrupa signed a Sublease Agreement that \"supersede[d] all prior agreements[,]\" \nincluding the First Agreement. D.I. 5-4 \u00a7 37; D.I. 1 ,r 11. As of June 1, 2011, at \nthe latest, therefore, Yogi Krupa purchased its motor fuel from and leased a \n11 trademark and the Station from GPM and from no other party. Under the PMP A, \nYogi Krupa could only have had a franchise relationship with GPM and not with \nGLeS. Yogi Krupa's conclusory assertion otherwise, D.I. ,r 40, is of no import, \nand, Primo's alleged relationship to GLeS is irrelevant, D.I. 28 at 3-4. To the \nextent that Yogi Krupa alleges violations of the First Agreement, the PMP A's one\u00ad\nyear statute of limitations has long since passed. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(a). \nFurther, whether or not Yogi Krupa is an intended third-party beneficiary of \nthe Master Lease has no bearing on whether the PMP A reaches GLeS and Primo. \n\"[T]he application of the PMPA is limited to causes of action arising between \nfranchisees and franchisors engaged in the petroleum marketing field.\" Patel V, 63 \nF .3d at 251. Yogi Krupa argues that the Master Lease places certain restrictions on \nGPM' s entry into new subleases, preserves the right of Primo and GLeS to take \nover each sublease if the Master Lease terminates, and prohibits GPM from taking \nan action that would violate the PMPA. D.I. 29 at 9. But the PMPA does not \nspeak of third-party beneficiaries or offer protections for subtenants against master \nlandlords. While the PMP A may have offered protections against GLeS or Primo \nif GLeS or Primo ever exercised the right to take over the Sublease Agreement, \nYogi Krupa nowhere alleges that either GLeS or Primo ever did so. In short, the \nPMPA does not reach a subtenant's indirect relationship with its master landlord-\n12 i.e., it does not reach a franchisee's indirect relationship with its franchisor's \nlandlord. \nThe Third Circuit has confirmed this understanding of the PMP A. In Patel \nV, the Pate ls entered a franchise agreement directly with Sun Company, a motor \nfuel refiner and marketer, in 1978. 63 F.3d at 249. In 1987, Sun sold the motor \nfuel station premises to Lancaster Associates, and Lancaster leased the motor fuel \nstation back to Sun through September 30, 1994; Sun then subleased the motor fuel \nstation back to plaintiffs through August 20, 1994. Id. at 249-50. In April 1994, \nSun notified plaintiffs of nonrenewal due to the expiration of Sun's lease with \nLancaster, and plaintiffs brought suit against both Sun and Lancaster. Id. at 250. \nThe Third Circuit held that \"Lancaster is not a refiner or distributor of motor fuel, \nand therefore falls outside the literal scope of the statute. For this reason, the \nPatels cannot obtain relief against Lancaster under the PMP A.\" Id. at 251. Primo \nand GLeS are landlords to Yogi Krupa's franchisor, and, just as in Patel V, Yogi \nKrupa cannot obtain relief against Primo and GLeS under the PMP A. \nYogi Krupa cites Koy/um, Inc. v. Peksen Realty Corp., 272 F.3d 138 (2d Cir. \n2001 ), for the proposition that a court may grant preliminary relief under the \nPMPA even when the facts are unclear. D.I. 28 at 9-10. In Koy/um, franchisee \nKoylum purchased motor fuel from Ocean and rented a motor fuel station from \nPesken; the Pesken and Ocean corporations had common owners. Id. at 140-41. \n13 Koylum alleged both that Pesken and Ocean threatened termination of its lease and \nfuel supply agreement on improper grounds and that Pesken sold the station to \n1677 Ridge, a third corporation, without providing Koylum with its PivtPA\u00ad\nmandated right of first refusal; it sought a preliminary injunction against Pesken \nand 1677 Ridge. Id. at 141-42. The Second Circuit held that Pesken had a \nfranchise relationship with Koylum, allowed Koylum to seek relief on that basis, \nand never considered whether Koylum also needed a franchise relationship with \n1677 Ridge to seek relief under the PivtPA. Id. at 145-46. For that reason, only \nthe Second Circuit's analysis ofKoylum's franchise relationship with Pesken is \npersuasive. And that relationship is distinguishable, because, at the time of Yogi \nKrupa's nonrenewal, GLeS and Primo lacked a franchise relationship with Yogi \nKrupa. Even at a preliminary stage, Yogi Krupa must allege sufficient facts to \nsupport a plausible inference that a franchise relationship existed before it could \nbring a claim under a PMP A. See Id. at 146 (\"What matters is whether the \ncomplaint alleges a violation of the Act. This turns, in part, on whether a franchise \nrelationship existed at the time of the events complained of.\"). \nYogi Krupa urges me to \"keep in mind that the PMP A was intended to \nremedy the disparity of bargaining power between franchisors and franchisees\" \nand that its '\"overriding purpose\"' was \"'to protect the franchisee's reasonable \nexpectation of continuing the franchise relationship.\"' D.I. 28 at 6-7 (quoting Ellis \n14 v. Mobil Oil, 969 F .2d 784, 788 (9th Cir. 1992)); see also Patel V, 63 F .3d at 250 \n(similar). But Congress balanced franchisee rights with the \"flexibility\" \ndistributors needed \"to respond to changing market conditions .... \" Patel V, 63 \nF.3d at 250 (cleaned up). Congress granted courts limited authority under the \nPMP A; I cannot expand that authority beyond what the statute allows. Finally, two \nsentences of Yogi Krupa's briefing assert that its Complaint \"alleges sufficient \nfacts to put squarely in question whether GLeS and Primo' s relationship with GPM \nwas less than arm's length.\" D.I. 28 at 12. But Yogi Krupa fails to point to any \nfactual allegations that support this argument; such \"a passing reference to an issue \nwill not suffice to bring that issue before this court.\" Skretvedt v. E.L DuPont De \nNemours, 372 F.3d 193, 202-03 (3d Cir. 2004) (cleaned up). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, I will grant Primo's and GLeS's Motion to Dismiss. \nPrimo and GLes have asked that I award them the attorney fees they have \nexpended in defending this action. I will, however, exercise my discretion and \ndeny that request, as I do not think Primo and GLes have established that Yogi \nKrupa's claims are frivolous. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(d)(3) (\"[T]he court may, in its \ndiscretion, direct that reasonable attorney ... fees be paid by the franchisee if the \ncourt finds that [an] action [under\u00a7 2805] is frivolous.\"). \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n15 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nYOGI KRUPA, Inc., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCivil Action No. 22-226-CFC \nGLeS, Inc., PRIMO PROPERTIES , LLC, \nGPM INVESTMENTS , LLC \nDefendants. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this Ninth day of November 2022, for the reasons set forth in \nthe Memorandum Opinion issued this day, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nDefendants GLeS, Inc. and Primo Properties , LLC's Motion to Dismiss the \nComplaint (D.I. 21) is GRANTED. \n.CONNOLLY , \nCHIEF JUDGE "}
