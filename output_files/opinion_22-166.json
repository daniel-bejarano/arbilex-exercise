Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJuly 11, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nCONNOLLY, Chief Jgdge:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Damion R. Thomas, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 1) Plaintiff\nappears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. He has filed\na request for counsel. (D.I. 6) The Court proceeds to review and screen the matter\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.\n2008). Plaintiff claims Defendants violated his rights to medical aid under the Eighth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. He provides occurrence dates of March\n24, 2201 and August 3, 2021 until \u201cnow.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 7)\n\nPlaintiff began suffering from right hip pain in mid-2020. (/d.) In the beginning of\n2021 the pain escalated to numbness and tingling on the right side from the shoulder\ndown to the right foot. (/d.) Plaintiff had multiple meetings with Defendant nurse\npractitioner William Igna. (/d. at 10) Plaintiff alleges that he was not taken seriously,\nwas told he was exaggerating his symptoms, and there was continuous refusal to see\nhim for months at a time. (/d.) On an unknown date, Igna told Plaintiff that he was \u201cat\nthe end of his rope,\u201d his hands were tied, and to \u201cprotect himself. . . the only thing he\n[could] do is refer [Plaintiff] to the prison doctor.\u201d (/d. at 10-11) Plaintiffs grandmother\ncontacted Defendant Captain Dotson in mid-2021 who was helpful in having a nurse\n\nevaluate Plaintiff. (/d. at 11) Plaintiff alleges that Dotson then returned Plaintiff to his\n\ncell with no progress made toward treatment. (/d.) Two to three weeks later Plaintiff\nwas evaluated by Defendant Dr. Adah. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant JTVCC\nWarden is responsible for the unnecessary delay in treatment. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff submitted multiple grievances. He alleges that Defendants Kristin H.\nScott, Lisa B. Brooks, Daniel J. Saxton, and Matthew Wofford are the medical staff who\nconducted the grievance hearings. (/d. at 11) Plaintiff alleges that they \u201cdeliberately\nignored his pleas for help\u201d and upheld his grievances to be revisited upon completion of\nmedical tests that never happened or were never approved. (/d.)\n\nOn August 3, 2021, Plaintiff and another inmate had a physical altercation and\nPlaintiff was injured. (/d.) Plaintiff was evaluated in the infirmary by medical staff and\nreceived stiches on his left eye and right hand. (/d. at 8) Plaintiff also suffered head\nlacerations for which he did not receive stiches. (/d.) Plaintiff underwent a neurological\nexam in the form of a questionnaire, but he did not receive a CT scan or an MRI. (/d.)\nPlaintiff alleges that since then, he has suffered from a number of ailments that are\nworsening and debilitating. (/d.) He alleges that he has not been treated or diagnosed\nand medical staff does not take his condition seriously. (/d. at 8-9)\n\nAn x-ray of Plaintiffs spine conducted in mid-2021 was normal. (/d. at 9) Plaintiff\nsaw the prison doctor in September 2021 and was told there was approval for a brain\nand cervical spine MRI, but only the brain MRI was approved. (/d. at 9) Plaintiff alleges\nthat Defendant Dr. Kondash denied the consult for the cervical spine MRI because\n\u201cpatient does not meet criteria\u201d and contends that the test would have been beneficial to\nPlaintiff's treatment in detecting his new injury. (/d. at 11-12) On December 23, 2021\n\nPlaintiff was transported to have the test performed, but he arrived two hours late and\n2\n\nthe test was rescheduled. (/d. at 9) Plaintiff alleges that as of January 5, 2022 he has\nyet to receive the test. (/d.)\n\nPrior to the December test, Plaintiff submitted multiple requests for a transfer to\nthe infirmary because he was in a dangerous environment and could not properly\ndefend himself due to his injuries. (/d. at 14) He alleges that all his requests went\nunanswered. (/d.)\n\nDefendant physical therapist \u201cMary\u201d recommended stretches and workouts that\nirritated and provoked Plaintiff's injury and make his symptoms worse. (/d. at 12-13)\nPlaintiff also alleges that Mary could not perform a proper evaluation because Plaintiff\nwas cuffed behind his back. (/d. at 13)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that he was forced to withstand needless pain and suffering due\nto negligence and refusal of treatment. (/d. at 9) He seeks injunctive relief and\ncompensatory damages. (/d. at 15)\n\nlll. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Baill v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison\nconditions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\n\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of\n3\n\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\ndeciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d\nCir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to\namend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v.\nMayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\n\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\n\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine\nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v.\nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that\nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. /qba/, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the\n\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Eleventh Amendment\n\nDefendant JTVCC Medical Department is immune from suit. The Eleventh\nAmendment of the United States Constitution protects an unconsenting state or state\nagency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens, regardless of the\nrelief sought. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Pennhurst\nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651\n(1974). The Delaware Department of Correction is an agency of the State of Delaware\nand the JTVCC medical department falls under the umbrella of the DOC. The State of\nDelaware has neither consented to Plaintiffs suit nor waived its immunity. Therefore,\nthe claims against JTVCC Medical Department will be dismissed as it is immune from\nsuit.\n\nB. Respondeat Superior\n\nPlaintiff alleges in a conclusory manner that the JTVCC Warden is responsible\nfor the unnecessary delay in his medical treatment. He appears to raise this claim\nbased upon the Warden's supervisory position. It is well-established that there is no\nrespondeat superior liability under \u00a7 1983. See Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330\n(3d Cir. 2016). Here, Plaintiff's vague and conclusory allegations do not suffice to\nimpose liability upon the warden. See Baraka v. McGreevey, 481 F.3d 187, 210 (3d Cir.\n2007) (defendant in a civil rights action \u201ccannot be held responsible for a constitutional\n\nviolation which he [ ] neither participated in nor approved\u201d; personal involvement in the\n\nalleged wrong is required.) The Warden will be dismissed as a defendant for the\nreasons discussed.\n\nCc. Grievance Committee Members\n\nPlaintiff alleges that medical staff Scott, Brooks, Saxton, and Wofford conducted\nthe grievance hearings, deliberately ignored his pleas for help, and upheld his\ngrievances to be revisited upon completion of medical tests that never happened or\nwere never approved. The filing of prison grievances is a constitutionally protected\nactivity. Robinson v. Taylor, 204 F. App\u2019x 155, 157 (3d Cir. 2006). To the extent that\nPlaintiff bases his claims upon his dissatisfaction with the grievance procedure or denial\nof his grievances, the claims fail because an inmate does not have a \u201cfree-standing\nconstitutionally right to an effective grievance process.\u201d Woods v. First Corr. Med., Inc.,\n446 F. App\u2019x 400, 403 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Flick v. Alba, 932 F.2d 728, 729 (8th Cir.\n1991)).\n\nTo the extent Plaintiff alleges that the foregoing Defendants were deliberately\nindifferent to his serious medical needs, the claims also fail, as they are alleged ina\nconclusory manner.\u2019 Notably Plaintiffs grievances were upheld, not denied, and this\ndoes not point to deliberate indifference. Nor are there allegations that any of the\nforegoing Defendants were involved in approval or denial of medical tests that Plaintiff\nsought. Rather, they planned to revisit Plaintiff's grievance once test results were\n\navailable.\n\n1 See Paragraph IV.D., infra, which discusses deliberate indifference to serous medical\nneeds.\n7\nThe claims fail as alleged. Therefore, the claims against Scott, Brooks, Saxton,\nand Wofford will be dismissed.\n\nD. Medical Claims\n\nPlaintiff raises medical claims against the remaining defendants: Igna, Dotson,\nDr. Kondash, Dr. Adah, and Mary. The allegations fails to state cognizable claims as\npled.\n\nTo set forth a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim for inadequate medical care,\na prisoner must allege (1) a serious medical need and (2) acts or omissions by prison\nOfficials that indicate deliberate indifference to that need. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S.\n97, 104 (1976). A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he or she knows that a\nprisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to\navoid the harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). Prison authorities,\nhowever, are \u201caccorded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment of\nprisoners,\u201d Durmer v. O'Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 67 (3d Cir. 1993), and \u201cdisagreement as to\nthe proper medical treatment\u201d does not give rise to a constitutional violation, Spruill v.\nGillis, 372 F.3d 218, 235 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nWith respect to Igna, Dotson, Dr. Adah, Dr. Kondash, and Mary, the Complaint\nfails to allege deliberate indifference. By Plaintiffs own allegations, he was seen by\nIgna on multiple occasions and Igna ultimately referred Plaintiff to the prison doctor.\nDotson was helpful in having Plaintiff evaluated by nurse and, Dotson, as a correctional\nofficer, was not responsible for later treatment provided to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was\n\nevaluated by Dr. Adah and Dr. Kondash and he received physical therapy from Mary.\n\nEven if these medical defendants were negligent in providing treatment, an issue not\ndecided by the Court, medical negligence without accompanying deliberate indifference\ndoes not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106 (\u2018[A]\ncomplaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical\ncondition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth\nAmendment.\u201d). Finally, Plaintiff's disagreement with the treatment provided and denial\nof the cervical MRI do not state a constitutional claim.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the medical claims against the foregoing\nDefendants. The Court finds amendment futile.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as moot Plaintiff's request for\ncounsel (D.1. 6); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)\nand (iii) and 1915A(b)(1) and (2).\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n"}
