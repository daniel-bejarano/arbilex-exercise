BACKGROUND  \na. Statutory Framework  \nThe IDEA offers States federal funds to assist in educating disabled children.  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas C nty. Sch. Dist. RE -1, 137 S.  Ct. 988, 993  (2017).  \nThose federal funds  \u2013 as is often the case  \u2013 come with strings attached: accepting St ates \nmust comply with certain statutory requirements.   Id. at 994.  One of those requirements \nis that every disabled child receives a \u201cfree appropriate public education,\u201d see 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1412(a)(1), which includes both \u201cspecial education\u201d and \u201crelated services.\u201d  \u00a7 1401(9).  \nAs defined by the Act, \u201cspecial education\u201d is \u201cspecially designed instructio n . . . to meet \nthe unique needs\u201d of a disabled child; \u201crelated services\u201d are any support services or \naccommodations \u201crequired to assist\u201d  in that i nstruction.  \u00a7 1401(29) , (26) ; see also \nEndrew F. , 137 S. Ct. at 993\u201394. \nThe States provide special education and related services by developing an \n\u201cindividualized education program\u201d (\u201cIEP\u201d) for each disabled student.  \u00a7 1401(9)(D).  An \nIEP is a written co mprehensive education plan identifying a disabled child\u2019s present \nperformance levels and future academic goals, and it outlines concrete steps to assist the \nstudent .  \u00a7\u00a7 1412(a)(4), 1414(d).   \nTo comply with the IDEA, an IEP must be \u201creasonably calculated to enabl e . . . \nprogress appropriate in light of the [disabled student\u2019s] circumstances.\u201d  Endrew F. , 137 \nS. Ct. at 1001.   That language is consistent with our Circuit\u2019s understanding: the  \n 3 \n educational program \u201cmust be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive \nmeaningful educational benefits in light of the student\u2019s intellectual potential and \nindividual abilities.\u201d  Ridley Sch. Dist. v. M.R. , 680 F.3d 260, 26 9 (3d Cir. 2012)  (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted) ; see also K.D. ex rel.  Dunn v. Downingtown Area \nSch. Dist. , 904 F.3d 248, 25 4 (3d Cir. 2018).  \nb. Facts  \nKindergarten to the third grade, 2013  \u2013 2017.   A.C. attended public school in the \nBrandywine School District from kindergarten through the fifth grade.  Before the third \ngrade, A.C.\u2019s behavior in school and at home became a concern.  At this point, A.C.\u2019s \nparents were primarily concerned with their daughter\u2019s reading abilities.  Brandywine \napparently acknowledged this concern, since in the third grade, A.C. received Tier III \nResponse to Intervention (\u201cRTI\u201d) academic training .2  \n \n2 RTI is a general, not special, education initiative.  R. 520.  It provides students with \nscientifically -based tiered intervention s designed to assist in read ing.  Id.  With RTI in \nplace, student s can make progress  in reading  comprehension  without  receiving special \neducation services.   Id.  Tier I is for students who read at grade level but may have some \nissues.  R . 438.  Tier II is for those students who read at or below grade level and require \ntargeted interventions .  R. 439.  Tier III \u2013 the most intensive Tier \u2013 is for students who \nare a t high risk of failure and may qualify for special education services.  Id.  Ms. Tania  \nPearson , M.A.,  a Brandywine school psychologist,  described Tier III as follows: \u201cWhen a \nstudent receives a Tier III intervention, they\u2019re getting the highest level of in tervention \nprior to considering specialized instruction , and it is more individualized.\u201d  R . 413 \n(emph . added) .  Dr. Lisa Lawson, Assistant Superintendent  at Brandywine , further \nexplained: \u201c[Y]ou can have students in Tier III for many years, and they still don\u2019t \nqualify or become eligible for special education and related services.  RTI is a general \neducation initiative, and it was done on purpose so that we could look to see if s tudents \ncould make progress with scientifically based evidence interventions without identifying \nthem with a disability that they did not have.\u201d  R . 520.  \n 4 \n Fourth grade, 2017 \u2013 2018.  In the beginning of her fourth -grade year, A.C.  \ncontinued to struggle with reading.  To start off the year, she performed poorly on the \nSTAR  exam,3 scoring in the third -grade equivalency range.   R. 440\u201341.  So she remained \nin Tier III RTI, receiving two  specific  intervention programs: Road to Reading and Read \nNaturally Fluency.4  By the end of fourth grade, in Spring 2018, A.C. scored near fifth -\ngrade equivalency standards on the STAR exam.  R . 441.  \nOver the course of her fourth -grade year, A.C. underwent a series of academic and \nbehavioral tests.  First, in January and February 2018, Ms. Pearson,  the Brandywine  \ncertified  school psychologist, evaluated A.C.\u2019s academic abilities using various metrics.5 \nOne test revealed that A.C.\u2019s scores for reading comprehension fell into the 2.9 grade \nequivalency category, which mean t that A.C. was reading far below fourth -grade \nstandards.  Ms. Pearson, however, testified that grade equivalency standards are not \n\u201cempirically sound,\u201d and that A.C.\u2019s reading capabilities, when compared to other fourth -\ngrade students, fell into an average percentile.  R . 403\u201305.  A.C.\u2019s math skills were \naverage.   R. 403.  Once Ms. Pearson completed this first set of academic tests, she \n \n3 The STAR exam is a reading comprehension exam.   R. 440\u201341.  All Brandywine \nstudents take  the STAR  exam three times throughout the year to measure ability.   Id.  \n \n4 The former is a phonics -based reading class , which at the time A.C. received it was  \nadministered by a special education teacher ; the latter addresse d reading comprehension \nand fluency.  R . 395.  \n \n5 To be thorough, Ms. Pearson examined A.C. using  the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for \nChildren, the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, and the Test of Written Language.  \nMs. Pearson also drew from report ca rds, interviews with faculty , and A.C.\u2019s parents.  R . \n402.   \n 5 \n mentioned that A.C. exhibited signs of anxiety and suggested that A.C. undergo \nsocioemotional testing.  R . 404.  A.C.\u2019s parents agreed to further testing, so Ms. Pearson \nthen administered to A.C. the Behavior Assessment System for Children.6  R. 405 .  The \ntest revealed signs of anxiety, depression, and poor social skills.  Id.  \nShortly  thereafter, A.C.\u2019s parents sought private therapy for A.C., and the therapist \ndiagnosed A.C. with a general anxiety disorder.   As a result, Brandywine created a \nSection 504 academic plan for A.C., which would be implemented the following year and \nincluded generic accommodations.   For example, among other things, teachers would : \nmake sure A.C. understood directions ; allow A.C. to h ave extra time in completing \nassignments ; read specific questions to A.C. ; and have A.C. summarize concepts or \ndirections.  R . 617.   \nFifth Grade, 2018 \u2013 2019.   A.C.\u2019s anxiety worsened during the fifth grade.  \nConcerned, her parents requested an independent educational evaluation (\u201cIEE\u201d) ,7 which \nBrandywine granted.  Dr. Harris Finkelstein  completed this evaluation in February 2019 \nand concluded that A.C. suffer ed from generalized anxiety and attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d).  R . 618.  See also Pls.\u2019 Br. 5.  \n \n6 The Behavior Assessment for Children, as Ms. Pearson testified, is \u201chighly valid and \nreliable.\u201d   R. 405.  It is a behavioral rating system that adults in contact with the student \ncomplete.  Id.  A.C.\u2019s mother and one of her teachers, Mrs. Anderson, completed this \nassessment.  Id.  Only A.C.\u2019s mother\u2019s assessment indicated signs of anxiety, depression, \nand poor soci al skills.  R . 406.  \n \n7 An IEE is \u201can evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not employed by the \npublic agency responsible for the education of the child in question \u2026\u201d  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n300.502(a) (3)(i) .   \n 6 \n End of Fifth Grade: the June and August 2019 IEP .  Approximately three months \nlater, in May 2019, Brandywine determined that A.C. qualified for an IEP under the \nIDEA.  Pls. \u2019 Br. 5 .  In June 2019, Brandywine developed A.C.\u2019s first IEP, and in August \n2019, the District revised it.  The IEP had three goals .  The first two related to A.C.\u2019s \nreading abilities and the third to her anxiety :  \n\u25aa Goal 1  \u2013 Inferential Reading Comprehension.  This first goal  targeted reading \ncomprehension and consisted of various supports and accommodations.8  R. 443. \nIn addition to the supports and accommodations, A.C. would receive direct \ninstruction three times per week for fifteen minutes each session.  Id.  See also R. \n620.   \n\u25aa Goal 2 \u2013 Written Response to Text -Based Questions.  The second goal would help \nA.C. bette r understand how to answer reading comprehension questions.9  R. 444.  \nAnd just as the first goal, A.C. would receive direct instruction related to text -\n \n8 The following is a partial list of the va rious supports and accommodations: the teacher \nwould model how to locate clues in the text to help make inferences; A.C. would receive \nextra time to read and answer questions; the teacher would break assignments into \nmanageable parts, frequently check in o n A.C., and highlight information in the text; the \nteacher would provide \u201csticky note\u201d summaries of the text to A.C. and \u201cwhisper\u201d to her \nas needed; the teacher would simplify directions, and A.C. would sit close to the source \nof instruction in her classes .  R. 444.  \n \n9 The following is a partial list of the supports and accommodations attached to the \nsecond goal: A.C would read the questions multiple times; the teacher would highlight \ninformation in the questions and orally read A.C.\u2019s written answer to ch eck for meaning; \nthe teacher would provide extra time to A.C. and would simplify directions.  R . 444.   \n 7 \n based responses three times per week for fifteen minutes each session.  Id.  See \nalso R. 620. \n\u25aa Goal 3 \u2013 Anxiety as Related to Task Involvement and Completion.  The third goal \nwould, according to Brandywine, help A.C. develop anxiety -reducing strategies.  \nR. 445.  To implement this goal, A.C. would receive individual counseling twice \nper week for thirty minutes, and she would receive consultative counseling for \nforty minutes per month.   Id.  See also R. 620. \nTo support all three  goals, A.C. would attend a \u201clearning support class in the special \neducation setting.\u201d   R. 443.  See also AR 357 ; Pls.\u2019 Re ply Br. 7.  Before the Panel, Ms. \nDenise Dilks, a special education teacher at Brandywine, testified that A.C. would attend \nthis learning support class for 90 minutes every other day; once there, according to this \ntestimony, A.C. would receive special inst ruction to advance her  three  goals.   R. 443.   \nSeptember 2019 and the Private School Placement.  Plaintiffs did not give \nBrandywine the chance to implement this IEP.  Believing  the IEP \u201cinadequate,\u201d Plaintiffs \nwithdrew A.C. from Brandywine and enrolled her  in the Sanford School,10 a private \nschool in Hockessin, Delaware.  Pls.\u2019 Br. 7.  \n \n10 The Sanford School is  \u201can independent, college -preparatory school for boys and girls \nin preschool (age 3) through high school.\u201d   See https://www.sanfordschool.org/about .  \nLocated on a 100 -acre teaching campus, Sanford prides itself as being one of the best \nprivate schools in the region.   See id .  Sixth  grade at Sanford costs $25,700; seventh \ngrade is $27,600.  See https://www.sanfordschool.org/admission/affordability/tuition .  Dr. \nLawson  was surprised Plaintiffs chose Sanford.  In her words, Sanford does not \n\u201cconcentrate its focus on student s with disabilities or students with special needs\u2026\u201d  R . \n526-27.   \n 8 \n c. Procedural History  \nOn July 30, 2021, A.C. and her parents filed a due process complaint with the \nDelaware Department of Education.   Pls.\u2019 Br. 3.   They sought compensatory damages for \nfourth and fifth grade (the 2017 \u20132018 and 2018 \u20132019 school years), reimbursement for \ntuition paid to the Sanford School for sixth and seventh grade (the 2019 \u20132020 and 2020 \u2013\n2021 school years), and prevailing -party atto rneys\u2019 fees.   Id.  Invoking the IDEA, \nPlaintiffs argued that Brandywine denied A.C. a FAPE.   \nThe Panel found in part for A.C. and in part for Brandywine.   Based on parent and \nteacher testimony, the Panel concluded that Brandywine should have known A.C. nee ded \nspecial education services for fourth and fifth grade.  So, finding that Brandywine did not \nprovide A.C. a FAPE  for those years , the Panel awarded A.C. compensatory education \nworth $31,800.  The Panel , however, concluded that, by finally offering A.C. the August \n2019 IEP, Brandywine complied with the IDEA and did not need to reimburse A.C. for \ntuition paid to Sanford.   And, lacking jurisdiction, the Panel refused to entertain the \nprevailing -party attorneys\u2019 fees issue.   \nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVI EW  \nThis Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.   When reviewing an appeal \nfrom a state administrative decision under the IDEA, federal district courts conduct a \nmodified  de novo review.  S.H. v. State -Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark , 336 F.3d 260, \n270 (3d Cir. 2003).  This means that district courts make t heir own findings by a \npreponderance of the evidence but also give \u201cdue weight\u201d to findings in the  \n 9 \n administrative proceeding.  Id.  See  also D.S. v. Bayonne Bd. of Educ. , 602 F.3d 553, 564 \n(3d Cir. 2010).  \u201cFactual findings from the administrative proceedi ngs are to be \nconsidered prima facie correct .\u201d  State -Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark , 336 F.3d at 270.   \nAnd \u201c[i]f the reviewing court does not adhere to those findings, it is obliged to explain \nwhy.\u201d   Id. (citation omitted).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nPlaintiffs  seek tui tion reimbursement for A.C.\u2019s sixth -and-seventh -grade years at \nthe Sanford School  under the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA.11  Based  on \nthe record, Brandywine complied with all three of these Acts  and t he District  offered \nA.C. a FAPE .  \na. Whether Brandywine Violated the IDEA  \nA student is entitled to tuition reimbursement  for a unilateral placement  \u201conly if a \nfederal court concludes both that the public placement violated [the] IDEA and that the \nprivate school placement was proper under the Act.\u201d   Florence C nty. Sch. Dist. Four v. \nCarter  ex rel. Carter , 510 U.S. 7 , 15 (1993).  To satisfy the first pron g12 \u2013 that the public \n \n11 The Panel\u2019s  decision to award  compensatory damages  to Plaintiffs for A.C.\u2019s fourth -\nand-fifth-grade years  is not challenged in this civil action .  Therefore , it is unnecessary to \naddress that portion of the Panel\u2019s decision.   \n \n12 Brandywine also argues that the evidence adduced at the hearing demonstrated that \nSanford was not an appropriate placement for A.C. because it did not provide the \nevidence -based specialized instruction A.C.  required for her read ing and emotional \nneeds.   Def.\u2019s Br. 2 \u20133.  Because Brandywine offered A.C. an appropriate IEP, it is not \nnecessary to reach the second prong under Florence County  \u2013 i.e., whether the private \nschool placement was proper under the IDEA.    \n 10 \n placement violated the IDEA \u2013 Plaintiffs must prove that Brandywine failed to offer  A.C. \nan IEP \u201creasonably calculated to enable \u2026[her] to make progress appropriate in light of \n[her] circumstances.\u201d  Endrew F ., 137 S.  Ct. at 1001.  \nAs Endrew F.  instructs , the discussion must focus on the IEP.  According to \nPlaintiffs, the IEP is facially deficient because it fails to provide \u201csufficient supports and \nservices to meet [A.C.\u2019s]  reading, math, emotion al, behavioral, and executive functioning \nneeds.\u201d  Pls. \u2019 Br. 17.  Plaintiffs add they were unaware A.C. would receive RTI in middle \nschool  since the IEP did not include RTI.   Pls.\u2019 Br. 12.   And finally, Plaintiffs contend \nthey were unaware A.C. would receive 90 minutes of special instruction  every other day \nto suppo rt her goals  \u2013 they complain that  the IEP only lists a \u201clearning support class\u201d and \ndid not spell out its precise contours.   Pls.\u2019 Reply Br. 7 . \nReading .  Plaintiffs  first argue  that the IEP fails to provide \u201csufficient supports and \nservices to meet [A.C.\u2019s] reading\u2026needs.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Br. 17.  As a preliminary note , Plaintiffs  \nprovide no explanation as to why the IEP\u2019s reading -related supports  are insufficient.   The \nIEP listed two goals related to reading: one to assist in \u201creading comprehension\u201d and \nanother to assist in responding to \u201ctext  based\u2026questions.\u201d  As the Panel explained \u2013 and \nas the record indicates \u2013 both goals include d various supports and accommodations and \nrequired A.C. to receive direct instruction for 45 minutes each week.   For example, \nA.C.\u2019s teachers would: model how to make logical inferences when reading texts; allow \nA.C. to have extra time to read and answer questions; break assignments  into manageable \nchunks; highlight important information in texts and frequently check A.C. for  \n 11 \n unde rstanding;  simplify directions and provide sticky \u2013note summaries of reading \nmaterials to A.C.; and make sure that A.C. sat close to the source of instruction.  R . 620.  \nAnd t o be clear, t hese supports and accommodations were  not exhaustive.13   \n\u201cAny review of an IEP must appreciate that the question is whether the IEP is \nreasonable , not whether the court regards it as ideal.\u201d  Endrew F. , 137 S.  Ct. at 999.  An \nIEP need not  provide \u201cthe optimal level of services\u201d that parents might desire for thei r \nchild.   Bayonne Bd. of Educ. , 602 F.3d  at 557.  \u201cThe IEP must aim to enable the child to \nmake progress.\u201d  Endrew F. , 137 S.  Ct. at 999.  Applying these standards here, the IEP\u2019s \nreading -related services and accommodations were reasonabl y designed to enab le A.C. to \nmake progress.    \nMath .  Plaintiffs next focus on the IEP\u2019s lack of any math -related services or \nsupports.  Plaintiffs argue  that the IEP\u2019s failure to \u201cprovide special education instruction \nin math\u201d adds to its deficiency.  Pls. \u2019 Br. 11.   However , the record makes clear that \nA.C.\u2019s math skills were average, and her math fluency scores were above average.  R . \n403.  Indeed, A.C.\u2019s fif th-grade progress report showed that she progressed  in \nmathematics.14   \n \n13 Approximately 10 more supports and accommodations were laid out in A.C.\u2019s reading \ngoals.   See R. 620-21. \n  \n14 For example, Rebecca Hurford, A.C.\u2019s fifth grade teacher at Brandywine , testified: \n\u201c[I]n operations and algebraic thinking, [A.C.] continued to work at a fifth grade \nlevel\u2026 [N]umbers and operations, she mastered by that second marking period. She could \ndo all that with no problem. Same with measurement and data \u2026So that\u2019s working at the \nfifth grade level .\u201d  R. 430 (emph . added).   \n 12 \n Plaintiffs\u2019 math -related claim is similar to  the situation in P.P. ex rel. Michael P. \nv. W. Chester Area Sch. Dist. , 585 F.3d 727 (3d Cir. 2009).  There , plaintiffs argued that \na schoo l district denied their son a FAPE  since the IEP and evaluation report (\u201cER\u201d) \nlacked services related to \u201cmath computation and\u2026social and emotional functioning.\u201d   \nId. at 738.  As the Court noted, \u201cthose areas were not identified as suspected disabilities \nand so were properly excluded from the ER.\u201d  Id.  Similarly, the  record here fails to \nindicate that A.C. had a math -related disability .  Therefore, the IEP need not include a \nmath -related go al. \nEmotional, Behavioral, and Executive Functioning .  Plaintiffs next argue that the \nIEP fails to address A.C.\u2019s \u201cemotional, behavioral, and executive functioning\u201d needs.   \nPls.\u2019 Br. 17.  Specifically, they complain that the IEP did not provide \u201cdirect ins truction \nto help with\u2026ADHD and executive functioning needs.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Br. 16.  But this claim has \nlittle basis in the record.  To accommodate for  A.C.\u2019s ADHD and general anxiety, \nBrandywine offered individual counseling twice per week for 30 minutes each ses sion \nand consultative counseling.  As to individual counseling, a school psychologist would \nmeet with A.C. to develop anxiety -reducing strategies, and as to consultative counseling, \nthe psychologist would observe A.C. in classrooms and work with her teache rs and \nparents.    \nIt is worthwhile to compare these Brandywine offerings to the Sanford  School\u2019s .  \nPlaintiffs mention in their brief that, at Sanford, A.C.\u2019s \u201ccounselor and teachers regularly \nmet and collaborated to develop and improve behavioral strategie s,\u201d and A.C. and her  \n 13 \n counselor met \u201ctwice per month to work individually on coping strategies .\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Br. 22.   \nThe record confirms this.  Courtney Gregor, the middle school counselor and learning \nservices specialist at Sanford, met with A.C. \u201conce or twic e per month\u201d for her \n\u201csocioemotional needs.\u201d  R . 592.  However, as explained,  Brandywine offered  A.C. \nindividual counseling services twice per week , and Brandywine\u2019s consultative counseling \nprovided for interaction between psychologist, teachers, and parents.  \nRTI.  Plaintiffs argue the IEP failed to indicate that A.C. would continue to receive \nRTI.  Therefore, the argument goes, A.C.\u2019s parents were \u201cunaware\u201d that RTI services \nwould be \u201cavailable to A.C. for sixth grade.\u201d   Pls.\u2019 Br. 16.   However , the record reflects \nthat RTI at Brandywine  is a general education initiative, like social studies or art.  R . 496.  \nIt is not meant exclusively for special education students.  Id.  When a Brandywine \nstudent requires Tier II or III RTI,  see supra note 2, that accommodation would be listed \non the student\u2019s individual schedule, not her IEP.  Id.  Indeed, any argument that an IEP \nmust list the child\u2019 s regular class schedule would run contrary to the IDEA, which \nrequires an IEP  to describe only the \u201cspecial education and related services\u2026that will be \nprovided.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV).  Accordingly, Brandywine\u2019s failure to \ninclude RTI in the IEP does not render it deficient .  \nThe Learning Support Class .  Finally, Plaintiffs take issue with the Panel\u2019s  \ntreatment of the \u201clearning support class\u201d \u2013 particularly its reliance on \u201cinadmissible\u201d \ntestimony.  Pls.\u2019 Br. 17.  Plaintiffs concede that  the IEP lists a \u201clearning support class .\u201d  \nPls.\u2019 Reply Br. 7.  But Plaintiffs maintain they did not know the precise contours of this  \n 14 \n class until the Due Process Hearing.15  Pls.\u2019 Reply Br. 7.     \nIt is true, as Plaintiffs argue, that \u201cthe measure and adequacy of an IEP can only be \ndetermined as of the time it is offered to the student, and not at some later date.\u201d  \nFuhrmann v. E. Hanover Bd. of Educ. , 993 F.2d 1031, 1040 (3d Cir.  1993).   \u201c[A] court \nshould\u2026use evidence acquired subsequently to the creation of an IEP only to evaluate \nthe reasonableness of the school district\u2019s decisions at the time they were made.\u201d  \nBayonne Bd. of Educ. , 602 F.3d at 564\u201365.  The Second Circuit has  addressed the scope \nof this  rule, and both parties cite to that Circuit for guidance.  In R.E. v. N .Y.C. Dep\u2019t of \n \n15 During the Due Process Hearing , A.C.\u2019s mother testified  about  what appears to be a \nconversation between herself and school administrators during the August 2019 IEP \nmeeting:  \n \nQ: During this meeting,  was there discussion about that educational support \nclassroom?  \nA: The learning support classroom?  \nQ: Correct.  \nA: Yes, that she would go there for 90 minutes twice a week.  \nQ: Okay. And what was your understanding on what would be worked on \nduring that lea rning support class?  \nA: Her IEP goals.  \nQ: Do you know how big the classroom sizes were that [A.C.]  was going to \nbe entering?  \nA: They said average was like 10, 12.  \nQ: Was that the learning support class, or was that her general education \nclasses?  \nA: Her l earning support class.  \n \nR. 545.  This testimony would appear to indicate that A.C.\u2019s mother was aware of the \ncontours of the learning support class  before A.C.\u2019s transfer to the Sanford School.   In \nany event, as explained infra , Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Panel erred with regard to hearing \ntestimony on the learning support class is without merit.    \n \n  \n 15 \n Educ ., 694 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2012),  the Second Circuit explained:  \nWhile testimony that materially alters the written plan is not \npermitted, testimony may be received that explains or justifies \nthe services listed in the IEP.   For example, if an IEP states \nthat a specific teaching method will be used to instruct a \nstudent, the school district may introduce testimony at the \nsubsequent  hearing to describe that teaching method and \nexplain why it was appropriate for the student.  The district, \nhowever, may not introduce testimony that a different \nteaching method, not mentioned in the IEP, would have been \nused.  \n \nId. at 186\u201387.   \nOther district courts in our Circuit have cited  Fuhrmann , Bayonne Bd. of Educ. , \nand N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ.  to guide retrospective testimony analysis.  See e.g., T.E. v. \nCumberland Valley Sch. Dist. , 2014 WL 47340 (M.D. Pa. 2014);  see also  Jalen Z. v. Sch . \nDist. of Ph ila., 104 F.  Supp.  3d 660  (E.D.  Pa. 2015).  In Jalen Z. , the district court found \nadmissible subsequent testimony that explained a support class\u2019 \u201cspecific structure and \nday-to-day routines.\u201d  Id. at 677.  Similarly, Brandywine here offered testimony to \nexplain its learning support class.  Specifically, the testimo ny explained that nearly every \nspecial education student in Brandywine attends a learning support class for 90 minutes \nevery other day.   R. 443.  In the class, a small group of students work s to further their \nspecial education goals under the supervision o f a teacher.   Id.  This testimony does not \nalter  the IEP; it explains it.  Brandywine developed the revised IEP over two months, and \nit had multiple meetings with A.C.\u2019s parents concerning the substance of the IEP.   R. 618. \nIn short, Plaintiffs have not pointed to evidence in the record that undermine s the  \n 16 \n Panel\u2019s decision , and they have failed to demonstrate  that the IEP was not \u201creasonably \ncalculated to enable\u2026progress appropriate in light of [ A.C.\u2019s ] circumstances.\u201d  See \nEndrew F ., 137 S.  Ct. at 1001.  \nb. Whether Brandywine Violated Section 5 04 of the Rehabilitation Act  \nSection 504 \u201cpromise[s] non -discriminatory access to public institutions.\u201d  Fry v. \nNapoleon Cmty. Schs. , 580 U.S. 154, 171  (2017) .  In the context of special education, \nSection 504 carries a FAPE  requirement.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(a).  Under Section 504, \na school district \u201cmust reasonably accommodate the needs of the handicapped child so as \nto ensure meaningful participation in educ ational activities and meaningful access to \neducational benefits.\u201d  Ridley Sch. Dist. , 680 F.3d at 280.  Here, Plaintiffs base their \nSection 504 claim on a theory identical to their IDEA claim: namely, that Brandywine \nfailed to provide A.C. a FAPE .  For th e reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 504 \nclaim must fail.16   \nc. Whether Brandywine Violated the Americans with Disability Act  \nPlaintiffs fare no better under the ADA.  To prevail on their ADA claim, A.C. and \nher parents must prove that A.C. : (1) ha s a disability ; (2) was otherwise qualified to \nparticipate in a school program ; and (3) was denied the benefits of the program or was \n \n16 Citing no controlling authority,  Plaintiffs  argue that this Court must use a de novo  \nstandard of review for their Section 504 a nd ADA claims; the modified de novo  standard , \nthey argue,  applies only to the IDEA.   Pls.\u2019 Br. 10 .  They further note the following:  \nBecause  the Panel did not consider the Section 504 and ADA claims, this Court cannot \ndefer to any factual findings made by the Panel when considering those claims.  Pls.\u2019 Br. \n17 n.5.  To be clear, this  Court reaches its conclusions regarding Section 504 and the \nADA under either standard of review.   \n 17 \n otherwise subject to discrimination because of her disability.  Chambers  ex rel. Chambers  \nv. Sch. Dist. of Phila . Bd. of Educ. , 587 F.3d 176, 189 (3d Cir. 2009).   Again, Plaintiffs \nrely on  their claim that Brandywine failed to provide A.C. a FAPE .  For reasons \npreviously explained , Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claim must fail.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons discussed , Brandywine\u2019s motion for judgment on the \nadministrative record  is granted , Plaintiffs \u2019 cross -motion  is denied , and Judgment is \nentered in favor of Brandywine.
