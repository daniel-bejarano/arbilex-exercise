Connolly", "date": "07-11-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nROBERT LOVE, et al., )\nPlaintiffs,\nVv. 5 C.A. No. 22-004 (VAC)\nCOLLINS SEITZ, et al.,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nRobert Love and Raquan Womack, Howard R. Young Correctional Institution, Wilmington,\nDelaware. Pro Se Plaintiffs.\n\nJuly 11, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nGh AC cute JUDGE:\n\nPlaintiffs Robert Love and Raquan Womack, along with several other pretrial detainees\nat the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington, Delaware, commenced this\naction on January 3, 2022.' (D.L. 2). Plaintiffs appear pro se and have been granted leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 13, 17). Also pending are motions filed by dismissed Plaintiff\nDiAndre Willis. (D.I. 25, 26). This Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \u00a7 1915A(a).\n\nIL BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for screening\npurposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiffs\nallege that violations of the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights occurred\nfrom March 16, 2020 through May 26, 2021. Named Defendants are Delaware Supreme Court\nJustice Collins Seitz, New Castle County Superior Court, Delaware Family Court, attorney\nBenjamin Gifford, Delaware Supreme Court Justices, and the State of Delaware. Plaintiffs seek\ncompensatory damages and injunctive relief.\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions\nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is\nimmune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner\n\n' All other Plaintiffs are dismissed.\n\nseeks redress from a governmental defendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with\nrespect to prison conditions), The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true\nand take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny,\n515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because\nPlaintiffs proceed pro se, their pleading is liberally construed and their Complaint, \u201chowever\ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by\nlawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley v.\nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 331\n(1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a\nclaim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly\nbaseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule\n12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However,\nbefore dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must\ngrant Plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.\nSee Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true and viewing therh in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v.\n\n2\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a\ncomplaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation\nof the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d\nCir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See\nWilliams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S, at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts\nsufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson vy. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\nTil. DISCUSSION\n\nA. State Actor\n\nBenjamin Gifford, an attorney, will be dismissed as a defendant. To state a claim under\n42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, a plaintiff must allege \u201cthe violation of a right secured by the Constitution or\nlaws of the United States and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person\nacting under color of state law.\u201d West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) (citing Parratt v. Taylor,\n451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981), overruled in part on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S.\n327, 330-31 (1986)). To act under \u201ccolor of state law\u201d a defendant must be \u201cclothed with the\nauthority of state law.\u201d West, 487 U.S. at 49. The Court takes judicial notice that Gifford is an\nattorney in private practice. There are no allegations that Gifford is a state actor or clothed with\nthe authority of state law. In fact, there are no allegations in the Complaint directed towards\n\nGifford.\n\nTherefore, all claims against Gifford will be dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)G) and \u00a7 1915(A)(b)(1).\n\nB. Immunity\n\nThe remaining Defendants are immune from suit. The State of Delaware, the New Castle\nCounty Superior Court, and the New Castle Family Court are state entities and thus immune\nfrom monetary relief suit under the Eleventh Amendment. See Benn y. First Judicial Dist. of\nPa., 426 F.3d 233, 239-40 (3d Cir. 2005) (concluding that Pennsylvania\u2019s First Judicial District\nis a state entity entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity), In addition, Defendants are not\npersons as is required to state a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. at 48.\nTherefore, the foregoing Defendants will be dismissed.\n\nPlaintiffs also sue Collins J. Seitz, Jr., Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court,\nDelaware Supreme Court Justices, New Castle County Superior Court Commissioner/Judge, and\nFamily Court Commissioners. As alleged, Plaintiffs take exception to actions taken and orders\nentered by the foregoing judges in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects upon\ncourt proceedings and criminal cases. The foregoing judges have judicial immunity. \u201cA judicial\nofficer in the performance of his duties has absolute immunity from suit and will not be liable for\nhis judicial acts.\u201d Capogrosso v. The Supreme Court of New Jersey, 588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.\n2009) (quoting Azubuko v. Royal, 443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir. 2006)). \u201cA judge will not be\ndeprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in\nexcess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted \u2018in the clear\nabsence of all jurisdiction.\u201d\u201d Jd. (citations omitted). There are no facts to show that any of the\n\njudges acted in the absence of jurisdiction. They are immune from suit and will be dismissed.\nIV. MOTIONS\n\nPlaintiff DiAndre L. Willis voluntarily dismissed his claims. (D.I. 23, 24) When he\ndiscovered that he remained responsible for payment of the filing fee, he asked to be reinstated\nas a Plaintiff. (D.I. 25) He also requests counsel. (D.I. 26) The Complaint will be dismissed\nand amendment is futile. Therefore, the motions will be denied as moot.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as moot the motions filed by DiAndre L.\nWillis (D.I. 25, 26); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii)\nand \u00a7 1915A(b)(1), (2).\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nROBERT LOVE, et al., )\nPlaintiffs, 5\nv. C.A. No. 22-004 (VAC)\nCOLLINS SEITZ, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this Eleventh day of July 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1.

Amendment is futile.\n\n3. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.\n\nChief Judge \u00a3\n\n"}
