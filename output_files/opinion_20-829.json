A good summary of the  relevant  factual background regarding this matter can be found in \nthe Court\u2019s  July 16, 2021 Report and Recommendation (\u201cReport\u201d) .  (See D.I. 28 at 1- 6)   \n B. Procedural Background  \nThe Government filed the Petition on June 19, 2020, along with a supporting declaration \nauthored by an IRS Revenue Agent.  (D.I. 1; D.I. 3)  With the Petition, the Government sought \nfrom DDOI certain outstanding documents and testimony pursuant to the Summons at issue.  \n(Id.)  On October 15, 2020, United States District Judge Maryellen Noreika referred this case to \nthe Court to hear and resolve all pre -trial matters up to and including expert discovery matters.  \n(D.I. 6)  \nOn February 8, 2021, DDOI filed a motion to quash the petition to enforce the S ummons , \nor in the alternative, for a protective order ( the \u201cmotion to quash\u201d) .  (D.I. 16)  After holding a \nhearing on the Petition and the motion to quash, on July 16, 2021, the  Court issued the Report , in \nwhich it recommend ed that the Petition  be granted and the motion to quash be denied.  (D.I. 28)2  \nOn September 29, 2021, Judge Noreika issued an Order and Memorandum Opinion (the \u201cMO\u201d) \noverruling DDOI\u2019s objections  to the Report and adopt ing the Report \u2014thus granting the \nGovernment\u2019s Petition and denying DDOI\u2019s  motion to quash.  (D.I. 35, D.I. 36)   \nOn October 28, 2021, DDOI filed a notice of appeal of the District Court\u2019s O rder and \nMO to the Third Circuit .  (D.I. 39)   DDOI also filed the instant Motion on the same day , by \n \n2  On September 21, 2021, the Court is sued an Errata Order that made a few non -\nsubstantive changes to the text of the Report.

STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA stay pending appeal is an \u201cextraordinary remedy[ .]\u201d  El v. Marino, 722 F. App\u2019 x 262, \n267 (3d Cir. 2018) ; see also  Conestoga Wood Specialities Corp. v.

Feb. 8, 2013) .  \u201cThe granting of \na motion for stay pending appeal is discretionary with the court.\u201d   In re Ursa Operating Co. LLC , \nNo. 20- 12067 (BLS), 2021 WL 1751852, at *4 (D. Del. May 4, 2021)  (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted).   The party requesting a stay bears the burden to show that the \ncircumstances justify an exercise of that discretion.  Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 433- 34 \n(2009).   \nWhen assessing  a motion to stay pending appeal , the Court  considers:  (1) whether the \nmovant has made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d  that it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the \nmovant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether a stay will substantially injure other interested parties; and (4) where the public interest lies.   El, 722 F. App\u2019 x at 267;  Republic  of \nPhilippines v. Westinghouse Elec . Corp., 949 F.2d 653, 658 (3d Cir. 1991) .  The first two factors \nare the most critical.  In re Revel AC, Inc. , 802 F.3d 558, 568 (3d Cir. 2015)  (noting that the first \nfactor , relating to the likelihood of success on the merits, is \u201carguably the more important piece \nof the stay analysis\u201d) .

If, however, a movant \ndoes make a sufficient showing that it can win on the merits and that it will suffer irreparable \nharm absent a st ay, then the Court must \u201cbalance the relative harms considering all four factors \nusing a \u2018sliding scale\u2019 approach.\u201d  Id. (internal quotation ma rks and citation omitted); see also \nS.S. Body Armor I., Inc. v. Carter Ledyard & Milburn LLP , 927 F.3d 763, 772 (3d Cir. 2019) . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nIn this opinion, the Court will address whether DDOI has made a sufficient showing as to \nlikelihood of success on the merits .  For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that it \nhas not.  In light of this, the Court need not address the remaining motion for stay pending appeal factors and will recommend  that the Motion be denied.   See, e.g., S.S. Body Armor I., Inc., 927 \nF.3d at 775.  \nAs noted above, a party seeking a stay pending appeal must make a  \u201cstrong  showing\u201d  that \nit can prevail on the merits .  In other words, it must demonstrate  that is has  \u201ca reasonable chance, \nor probability, of winning\u201d that is \u201cbetter than negligible\u201d but \u201cneed not be more likely than not[.]\u201d  In re Revel AC, Inc. , 802 F.3d at 5 68-69 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .\n4  \n \n4  The Governme nt notes that some courts have held that the first \u201clikelihood of \nsuccess\u201d factor should be more stringently applied in cases determining whether to stay \nenforcement of an IRS summons.  (D.I. 43 at 2 n.2  (citing cases) ); see, e.g., U.S. v. Diversified \nGrp., Inc., No. M 18- 304 PKL, 2002 WL 31812701, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 13, 2002) ( citing \ncaselaw from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second  Circuit, which stands for the \nproposition that in such a case, a stay should not be granted unless there is a \u201csubstantial possibility of success\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  However, the Court is not aware of any Third Circuit caselaw suggesting that this factor should be assessed differently in an IRS summons case.  Thus, it declines to do so here.  \n 5 \n With its Motion, DDOI asserts that it has made the requisite s howing by demonstrati ng that the  \nDistrict Court erred on two fronts, which the Court will take up in turn.   \nA. Use of a \u201cThreshold\u201d Test  \nDDOI\u2019s first argument as to th e \u201clikelihood of success\u201d factor \u2014indeed, what it calls the \n\u201cfundamental issue\u201d on appeal \u2014is its contention that the District Court ( in upholding the Court\u2019s \ndecision in the Report)  wrongly concluded that :  (1) although a three -factor test applies to an \nassessment of whether the state law at issue here (Section 6 920 of the Delaware Insurance Code, \nhereafter \u201cSection 6920\u201d ) reverse preempts 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 (the federal law that permits the \nIRS to obtain information pursuant to the Summons) in light of the McCarran -Ferguson Act \n(\u201cMFA\u201d) ; (2) prior to  engaging in that  three- factor  analysis, a district court must first assess \nwhether an additional, threshold element (the \u201cthreshold element\u201d) has been met:  \u201cwhether the \nactivity complained of constitutes the \u2018business of insurance.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 40 at 8 ; see also id . at 10 \n(DDOI assert ing that the District Court\u2019s \u201cfundamental error\u201d was its \u201cuse and analysis of the \n\u2018threshold\u2019 requirement of whether the challenged conduct constitutes the \u2018business of insurance\u2019\u201d) )  DDOI claims that  the District Court\u2019s \u201cuse of the threshold [test] is inconsistent \nwith current Supreme Court [of the United States] and Third Circuit cases.\u201d  ( Id. at 10)  More \nspecifically , DDOI points to the fact that in Humana Inc. v. Forsyth , 525 U.S. 299 (1999)  and S. \nJersey Sanit. Co. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co., 840 F.3d 138 (3d Cir. \n2016) , the Supreme Court and the Third Circuit did not apply the threshold test.  (D.I. 40 at 10-\n11; see also  D.I. 43 at 3)    \nDDOI\u2019s argument here i s not new, and it was addressed by the Court (in the Report ) and \nthe District Court (in the MO) .  With regard to  Humana , both the Report and the MO discuss that \ndecision .  Both opinions explain that :  (1) in Humana, the Supreme Court did not e xplicitly 6 \n mention or appl y the threshold test ; (2) but at the same time, the Supreme Court there did not \nclearly and un ambiguously consider whether use of the threshold test  was proper; ( 3) therefore , \nthe Court is required to apply Third Circuit precedent on the issue; (4) the Third Circuit has \ntwice \u2014once before Humana in Sabo v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 137 F.3d 185 (3d Cir. 1998) and \nagain after Humana in Highmark, Inc. v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc ., 276 F.3d 160 (3d Cir . \n2001) \u2014applied the threshold test in a non- antitrust matter ; and (5) thus, the District Court must \nfollow that binding Third Circuit precedent  (in place since 1998 ) and apply the threshold test  \nhere.  ( D.I. 35 at 11; see also  D.I. 28 at 24)5  As for the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in S. Jersey \nSanit . Co., the District Court addressed that case in its MO .  In doing so, the District Court \nexplained that:  (1) in that case, the Third Circuit did not even discuss reverse preemption under the MFA in any detail , because the decision turned on a separate arbi tration -related  legal \nquestion; (2) even if  the S. Jersey Sanit. Co. Court\u2019s failure to reference the threshold test  in its  \nopinion could be said to bring the opinion into  conflict with prior Third Circuit precedent, S. \nJersey Sanit. Co. could not serve to overrule that prior precedent, pursuant to the Third Circuit\u2019s law and operating procedures.  (D.I. 35 at 12 (citing Reilly v. City of Harrisburg , 858 F.3d 173, \n177 (3d Cir. 2017); Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit , 524 F.3d 419, 426 (3d Cir. 2008)) )   \n \n5  DDOI argues that  the Court need not concern itself with Third Circuit caselaw \nbecause in Humana , the Supreme Court made it clear that \u201cthe proper test to use for determining \nwhether the MFA applied [was] a three -part test.\u201d  (D.I. 44 at 3)  As the Court noted in the \nReport, however, in Highmark , the Third Circuit :  (1) noted that it was aware of the Humana \ndecision and cited to that decision; but (2) still applied the threshold test.  (D.I. 28 at 24 n.13)  So \nthe Court does not see how it could conclude , in light of this, anything other than controlling \nThird Circuit caselaw \u2014caselaw that is not in conflict with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions \u2014\nindicates that the threshold test must be applied in  an MFA reverse- preemption analysis like this \none.   \n 7 \n In light of this, the Court cannot conclude that DDOI has \u201ca reasonable chance, or \nprobability, of winning\u201d its appeal on this issue that is \u201cbetter than negligible.\u201d  In so concluding, \nthe Court acknowledges that this is a complex area of the law .  And it recognizes that (as  DDOI \nhas pointed out ) some other courts outside of the Third Circuit have conclude d that  in cases  like \nthis one , they should not  utilize a threshold \u201cb usiness of insurance\u201d test .  (D.I. 40 at 11 (citing \nAutry v. Nw. Premium Servs., Inc ., 144 F.3d 1037 (7th Cir. 1998))  Here, however, the Court \u2019s \ndecision is simply premised on the fact the Report \u2019s and the MO\u2019s analys es were well grounded \nin binding Third Circuit precedent \u2014and that, in light of that precedent, D DOI does not have  a \nreasonable chance of prevailing in its appeal to the Third Circuit.   (D.I. 43 at 4) ; see also David \nv. Weinstein Co. Holdings, LLC , C.A. No.  21-171 (MN), 2021 WL 979603, at *3- 4 (D. Del. Mar. \n16, 2021), appeal dismissed sub nom. In re Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC , No. 21- 1598, 2021 WL \n4429044 (3d Cir. Apr. 27, 2021) (concluding that a party failed to meet its burden as to the first \nstay pending appeal factor , where Third Circuit precedent supported the decision at issue , and \nnoting that \u201c [p]recedent from outside this Circuit will not raise Appellants\u2019 likelihood of \nsuccess\u201d ); In re THG Holdings LLC , Case No. 19- 11689 (JTD), 2019 WL 6615341, at *4 (D. \nDel. Dec. 5, 2019)  (concluding the same, in part because although the moving party was arguing \nthat a 2019 Third Circuit decision supported its position, a pr eviously- issued  1992 Third Circuit \ndecision conflicted with the party\u2019s position and was still good law , in that it had never been \noverruled by the Third Circuit en banc ).   \nB. Whether the Challenged Conduct  at Issue Constitutes the  \u201cBusiness of \nInsurance\u201d  \n \nDDOI\u2019s other \u201clikelihood of success\u201d argument relates to its position that \u2014even if the \nDistrict Court was  correct that it must first make a threshold determination as to whether the \nconduct at issue constitutes the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d \u2014the District Court nevertheless erred by 8 \n \u201cconstru[ing] the critical term \u2018business of insurance\u2019 too narrowly in a case dealing with the \nfirst clause of Section 1012(b) of the MFA [i.e., a non- antitrust case].\u201d  (D.I. 40  at 1)  In this \nregard, DDOI charges  that the District Court \u201cimproperly focuses on the narrow \u2018business of \ninsurance\u2019 inquiry used in deciding antitrust cases under the MFA [,] instead of the broad \nstandard used in deciding non- antitrust cases . . . such as this one.\u201d  ( Id. at 7; see also id. at  8-10; \nD.I. 44 at 2- 3)  DDOI\u2019s arguments here are at times  hard to follow , but the Court will try to parse \nthem as best it can.  \nAs an initial matter, DDOI appears to fault the District Court for relying on three factors \nthat the Supreme Court articulated in Grp. Life & Health Ins. Co v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205 (1979) , in order to help assess whether  the challenged  conduct at issue amounts to the \n\u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d  (D.I. 40 at 11 n.7; see also  D.I. 35 at 15)   But as the District Court \nnoted in the MO (and as the Court noted in the Report), in Sabo, the Third Circuit itself :  (1) \nclearly stated that it \u201cdisagree[d]\u201d with the idea that these three factors should not be  used in \nnon-antitrust cases; (2) explained that the factors could \u201cprovide guidance\u201d in non- antitrust \nmatters ; and (3) also noted that the factors were only a \u201cstarting point\u201d  in the analysis.  Sabo, 137 \nF.3d at 191 & n.3; see also  (D.I. 28 at 26 -27 & n.16; D.I. 35 at 14- 16).  It cannot be error to \nfollow the guidance from  binding Third Circuit precedent, and that is what the District Court did \nhere.   \nDDOI also charges that the District Court ignore d the fact that \u201cthe Third Circuit has \nrecognized that laws which would not relate to the \u2018business of insurance\u2019 under the Second \nClause [of Section 1012(b) of the MFA] could still qualify as a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance under the First Clause [of Section 1012(b) of the MFA].\u201d  (D.I. 40 at 13 (citing In re Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F3d. 300, 360- 361 (3d Cir. 2010) ); see 9 \n also D.I. 44 at 2)   But the District Court recognized that very fact when conducting its analysis .  \n(D.I. 35 at 15 (\u201cTo be sure, there are distinct clauses in the relevant section of the MFA  [Section \n1012(b)] \u2014 the first clause addressing laws enacted for the purpose of regulating insurance and \nthe second clause addressing the reach of antitrust laws to the business of insurance.\u201d))   It simply \nalso recognized that, pursuant to the Third Circuit\u2019s analysis in Sabo, even when addressing a non-antitrust case involving the first clause of Section 1012(b), the court  must first address the \nthreshold question of whether the \u201cchallenged activity\u201d constitutes the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d  \nitself.   Sabo, 137 F.3d at 190- 91; see also  (D.I. 35 at 15- 16).   \nDDOI  also argue s that the District Court took a wrong, \u201cunduly narrow\u201d approach in \ndeciding that the challenged activity  did not relate to  the \u201c business of insurance ,\u201d in that the \nDistrict Court improperly:  (1) relied on the fact that th is activity \u201cdid not fit into any of the types \non the non- exhaustive list of [ examples set out in Secs. & Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Nat. Secs., Inc ., 393 \nU.S. 453 ( 1969) ( \u2018National Securities \u2019)]; and (2) concluded that the activity \u201cwas not focused on \nthe relationship  between an insurance company and policyholder .\u201d  (D.I. 40 at 13; D.I. 44 at 2)  \nDDOI seems to acknowledge that the conduct regulated by Section 6920 does not , in fact , match \nany of the  list of examples that National Securities  called out as amounting to the \u201cbusiness of \ninsurance.\u201d  But it argues that the National Securities  Court also noted that \u201cother activities of \ninsurance companies\u201d could qualify as the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d if they \u201crelate so closely to their status as reliable insurers\u201d \u2014and it claims that the challenged conduct  here fits that bill, \nbecause the statute \u201crelates to the collection of licensing information \u201d and \u201calso closely relates to \nan insurer\u2019s status as a reliable insurer.\u201d  (D.I. 40 at 14 (citing National Securities , 393 U.S. at \n460) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted) )  But what DDOI misses here is that in \nNational Securities , the Supreme Court explained that, in the end, an activity would constitute 10 \n the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d only to the extent it involved \u201cthe relationship between the insurance \ncompany and the policyholder.\u201d  393 U.S. at 460.  The District Court recognized this .  (D.I. 35 at \n16)  And it rightly concluded that one simply cannot reasonably argue that the challenged conduct at play in this case  (i.e., the conduct covered by S ection 6920)  is about the relationship \nbetween the insurance company and its policyholder .  (Id.)  Instead, the statute is all about \u201cthe \nrelationship between the . . . insurance company and regulator(s)\u201d  because it \u201ccenters around the \ngovernmental treatment of documents provided by captive insurance companies [\u2014]i.e., whether \nconfidential docume nts may be disclosed and under what conditions.\u201d   (Id.; see also  D.I. 28 at \n29-34)\n6 \nFor the above -stated reasons, and for the other reasons stated by the District Court in the \nMO, the Court concludes that DDOI has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  IV. CONCLUSION A motion for stay pending appeal  is one that seeks an extraordinary remedy.  On these \nfacts, DDOI  has not met its burden to show that such a remedy is warranted, due to its failure to \n \n6  DDOI  makes  another argument in support of its assertion that the challenged \nconduct at issue amounts to the \u201cbus iness of insurance\u201d:  that , despite the District Court\u2019s \nconclusion to the contrary, (D.I. 35 at 14), the activity really relates to the insurance licensing \nprocess .  (D.I. 40 at 11- 12)  Here, DDOI  focuses on the content of the remaining responsive \ndocuments that are in dispute between the parties  (i.e., the documents that the IRS is seeking, and \nthat DDOI refuses to turn over).  It says that those documents \u201call relate to the application and licensing\u201d of captive insurers or examinations.  (D.I. 40 at 12)  But as the District Court noted, in assessing the \u201c challenged conduct \u201d in a case like this, courts focus on the wording of the state \nstatute in question and how it relates to the dispute between the parties.  (D.I. 35 at 13- 14 \n(District Court concluding that the challenged conduct was fairly characterized as \u201c\u2018record \nmaintenance\u2019\u201d or, more specifically , as \u201cthe dissemination and maintenance of information, \ndocuments and communications maintained by the state\u201d because this categor ization \u201cflows \ndirectly from the language of Section 6920, which is what DDOI argues protects it from complying with the Summons\u201d) ; see also  D.I. 28 at 25- 26)  And regardless of what is the content \nor subject matter of the remaining disputed documents that  the IRS seeks to obtain from DDOI, \nSection 6920\u2019s provisions  (at issue here)  are all about the manner in which a regulator maintains \nand distributes certain information \u2014not about the substance of insurance licensing.     11 \n sufficiently demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.  Thus, the Court recommends that \nDDOI \u2019s Motion be DENIED.   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del.
