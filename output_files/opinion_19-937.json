PAITSEL, JR.,    :       :    Petitioner,    :       :     v.     :  Civil Action No. 19-937-LPS       :  DANA METZGER, Warden, and    : ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE   : STATE OF DELAWARE,     :        :    Respondents.    : ______________________________________________________________________________   \nMEMORANDUM \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \nIn May 2018, the Delaware Superior Court found Petitioner to be in violation of his \nprobation, and sentenced him to 21 years and 11 m onths of incarceration at Level V, suspended for \nsuccessful completion of the Key/Crest Program.  (D.I. 1-1)  On May 20, 2019, Petitioner filed in \nthis Court a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corp us Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, asserting the \nfollowing four grounds for relief: (1) the classi fication system at the James T. Vaughn Correctional \nCenter (\u201cJTVCC\u201d) violates Petitioner\u2019s due process rights because it does not provide a method for \nhim to satisfy the Key/Crest program portion of hi s sentence (D.I. 1 at 5); (2) the Key program is \nnot available at JTVCC (D.I. 1 at 7); (3) Peti tioner previously completed the Key Program in 2016 \nfor the same criminal charges for which he wa s on probation at the time  of his violation of \nprobation (D.I. 1 at 8); and (4) the DOC has denied Petitioner\u2019s requests to be sent to the Key program (D.I. 1 at 10).  Petitioner seeks immediat e release from Level V.  (D.I. 1 at 15)   \n \n 2 \n\u00a0II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n A district court judge may summarily dismiss a ha beas petition \u201cif it plainly appears from the \nface of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it th at the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d  Rule \n4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a), a federal district court can only entertain a \nhabeas petition challenging the legality of a pris oner\u2019s conviction or confinement pursuant to the \njudgment of a State court.  In turn, according to Article III, Section 2, of the United States Constitution, federal courts can only consid er ongoing cases or controversies.  See Lewis v. Continental \nBank Corp. , 494 U.S. 472, 477-78 (1990);  United States v. Kissinger , 309 F.3d 179, 180 (3d Cir. 2002) \n(actual controversy must exist during all stages of  litigation).  The \u201ccase-or-controversy requirement \nsubsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings.\u201d  Lewis , 494 U.S. at 477-78 .  \u201cThis means \nthat, throughout the litigation, the plaintiff must ha ve suffered, or be threatened with, an actual \ninjury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d   Spencer \nv. Kemna , 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998).  A case becomes moot, th ereby divesting a court of jurisdiction, if the \n\u201cissues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. \u201d  \nMurphy v. Hunt , 455 U.S. 478, 481 (1982).  Even if a ca se was live at its inception, an actual \ncontroversy must exist during all stages of litig ation to satisfy Article III\u2019s case or controversy \nrequirement.  See Kissinger , 309 F.3d at 180.  \nIII.   DISCUSSION  \n Petitioner does not challenge the legality of hi s conviction.  Instead, his four Claims are \nmore appropriately construed as challenges to th e conditions of Petiti oner\u2019s confinement and, \nspecifically, the lack or inaccessibility of certain  treatment programs.  Challenges to a prisoner\u2019s \nconditions of confinement do not assert issues co gnizable on federal habeas review and should be \nasserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  See Preiser v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 475, 498-99 (1973).  3 \n\u00a0In addition, it appears that the Petition is  now moot.  When Petitioner filed the instant \nPetition in May 2019, he was incarcerated at JTVC C in Smyrna, Delaware.  Subsequently, Petitioner \nwas released from JTVCC and released to the community to supervised release.1  Since Petitioner \nhas obtained the relief requested (release from Le vel V confinement), his pending habeas Petition no \nlonger presents a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d under Arti cle III, \u00a7 2, of the United States Constitution.   \nIn summary, the instant Petition is both moot and asserts issues that are not cognizable on \nfederal habeas review.  Accordingly, the Court do es not have jurisdiction over this proceeding.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \n For the aforementioned reasons, the Court w ill summarily dismiss the Petition as both non-\ncognizable and moot.  The Court will also declin e to issue a certificate of appealability because \nPetitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showin g of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Ci r. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer , 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997).  A \nseparate Order will be entered. \n \n        ________________________________                                 \nDated:  September 12, 2022    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\u00a0\n1To ascertain Petitioner\u2019s whereabouts, the Court accessed the Victim Information and Notification \nEveryday portal (VINELink).
