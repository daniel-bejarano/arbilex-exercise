Counsel for Individual Defendants\nand Nominal Defendant.\n\nNovember ik. 2021\n\nWilmington, DE\n\nPlaintiffs Becky Kiger and Heather Nelson assert derivative claims on behalf of Qualcomm\nInc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) against Defendants Steve Mollenkopf, Mark D. McLaughlin, Mark Fields,\nJeffrey W. Henderson, Ann M. Livermore, Harish Manwani, Jamie S. Miller, Clark T. Randt, Jr.,\nIrene B. Rosenfeld, Kornelis Smit, and Anthony J. Vinciquerra, who were directors of the\nCompany at the time the Complaint was filed (collectively, the \u201cDirector Defendants\u201d), and\nDefendants Barbara T. Alexander and Francisco Ros, who are former directors of the Company\n(collectively with the Director Defendants, the \u201cDefendants\u201d).! In general, Plaintiffs allege that\nthe Defendants breached their fiduciary duties and violated Section 14(a) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a), by allowing unlawful and discriminatory practices to\nproliferate at the Company, thereby exposing the Company to significant risk.\n\nDefendants have filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)\nand Rule 23.1. (DL 29). The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28\nUSS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332. (DI. 1 J] 28-29). For the following reasons, the Defendants\u2019 motion\nto dismiss is granted.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nQualcomm is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Diego, California. (DL. 1 4\n33). It creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. (/d.).\n\nOn July 17, 2020, Becky Kiger filed the first complaint in this action, asserting derivative\nclaims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control,\n\nunjust enrichment, and violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15\n\n| Defendant Mollenkopf was also the Chief Executive Officer of the Company at the time\nthe Complaint was filed.\n\nUSS.C. \u00a7 78n(a), and SEC Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9. On July 23, 2020, Heather Nelson,\nthrough the same counsel, filed a substantively identical complaint. On January 12, 2021, the\nKiger and Nelson Actions were consolidated (D.I. 18), and on February 9, 2021, Plaintiffs\ndesignated the Kiger complaint (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) as the operative one (D.I. 19).\n\nUnlike the typical derivative action, there was no specific event involving the Company or\nDefendants that gained public notoriety and precipitated the filing of these complaints.\nAccordingly, there is little background for the Court to provide.\n\nThe Complaint relies in part on the Company\u2019s annual meetings and the proxies issued in\nsupport thereof. Qualcomm filed its 2019 proxy statement on January 24, 2019 and its 2020 proxy\nstatement on January 23, 2020 (collectively, the \u201cProxies\u201d), Both Proxies contained\nrecommendations concerning the election of director nominees to the Board; advisory ratification\nof the Board\u2019s selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company\u2019s independent auditor;\nand advisory approval of executive compensation. (See D.I. 31-1, Exs. D, G).\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Plaintiffs must plead facts\nsufficient to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n677-78 (2009). The court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true,\nand view them in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. Jn re Fisker Auto. Holdings, Inc.,2017\nWL 492996, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 7, 2017). But the court need not accept as true allegations in the\ncomplaint contradicted by documents on which the complaint relies. In re: Enzymotec Sec. Litig.,\n2015 WL 8784065, at *11 (D.N.J. Dec. 15, 2015). The court\u2019s review is limited to the allegations\nin the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference, and\n\nitems subject to judicial notice. Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir. 2010).\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nBroadly speaking, Defendants assert three arguments. First, all the claims should be\ndismissed for failure to plead demand futility pursuant to Rule 23.1. Second, the Section 14(a)\nclaims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Third,, Plaintiffs\nlack Article III standing to seek mandatory injunctive relief.\n\nAs to the third argument, Defendants do not question Plaintiffs\u2019 status as stockholders of\nthe Company. Rather, Defendants appear to argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for\nwhich such mandatory injunctive relief might be granted as a remedy. Because no claims are\nsurviving the motion to dismiss, the Court need not address the standing argument at this time.\nThe Court will address the first two arguments in reverse order, starting with the failure to state a\nclaim under Section 14(a).\n\nA. Section 14(a) Claims\n\nSection 14(a), and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, prohibit a corporation from issuing\na proxy \u201ccontaining any statement which ... is false or misleading with respect to any material\nfact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein\nnot false or misleading.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9(a); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a)(1). To establish that a\nproxy violates Section 14(a), the plaintiff must prove that: (1) the proxy contained a false or\nmisleading statement; (2) the misstatement was material; and (3) the misstatement caused the\n\nplaintiff injury. Kooker ex rel. Hecla Mining Co. v. Baker, 497 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6 (D. Del. 2020).\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Complaint adequately alleges that six statements or omissions were\nmaterially misleading.\u201d (D.I. 34 at 24). Each statement or omission is addressed in turn.\n1. Governance Committee Goals\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the 2019 Proxy was materially false and misleading when it stated,\n\u201cThe Governance Committee\u2019s goal is to assemble a board of directors that brings to us a diversity\nof perspectives and skills.\u201d (D.I. 1 4 93). This statement is not actionable because it is not material.\n\nA statement is not material if it involves \u201csubjective analysis or extrapolations, such as\nopinions, motives and intentions, or general statements of optimism.\u201d Jn re Aetna, Inc. Sec. Litig.,\n617 F.3d 272, 283 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting EP MedSystems, Inc. v. EchoCath, Inc., 235 F.3d 865,\n872 (3d Cir. 2000)). \u201cSuch statements \u2018constitute no more than puffery and are understood by\nreasonable investors as such.\u2019\u201d Aetna, 617 F.3d at 283 (quoting In re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig.,\n180 F.3d 525, 538 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\nStatements about a board\u2019s or a company\u2019s goals are inactionable puffery, as multiple\ncourts have held. See Falat v. Sacks, 2021 WL 1558940, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2021) (statement\nthat Monster \u201cseek[s] to capture diversity in [its] candidates\u201d is puffery); Schiro v. Cemex, S.A.B.\nde C.V., 396 F. Supp. 3d 283, 298 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cstatements about goals\u201d are \u201cclassic\npuffery\u201d); Howard v. Arconic Inc., 395 F. Supp. 3d 516, 549 (W.D. Pa. 2019) (\u201ca declaration of\n\n299\n\ngoals and aspirations for the Company ... \u2018are inactionable puffery\u2019\u201d (quoting City of Pontiac\n\nPolicemen\u2019s & Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys. v. UBS AG, 752 F.3d 173, 183 (2d Cir. 2014)). Therefore, the\n\nSection 14(a) claim based on the \u201cgoal\u201d statement is dismissed with prejudice.\n\n2 Arguments based on any other statements or omissions alleged in the Complaint are\n\ndeemed waived because they were not presented in Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition brief. See Walsh v.\nFusion Japanese Steakhouse, Inc., 2021 WL 2917795, at *5 (W.D. Pa. July 12, 2021) (\u201cA party\nthat fails to address an argument in its brief in opposition ... waives that argument\u201d).\n\n2. Governance Committee Instructions\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the 2020 Proxy was materially false and misleading when it stated,\n\u201c(T]he Governance Committee will include, and instruct any search firm it engages to include,\nwomen and racially/ethnically diverse candidates in the pool from which the Governance\nCommittee selects director nominees\u201d (hereinafter, the \u201cInclusion Statement\u201d). (See D.I. 1 4 94).\nThe Inclusion Statement is not actionable because Plaintiffs have failed to allege any facts\nsupporting a reasonable inference that it was false or misleading.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the Inclusion Statement was false and misleading because \u201cQualcomm\nhas no African Americans on its Board.\u201d and \u201c[N]o African American or other minority candidate\nhas been elected to the Qualcomm Board in the last six years.\u201d (id. at 96). The fact that no\nminority candidate has been elected to the Board in the last six years does not necessarily mean\nthat the Governance Committee did not include or instruct its search firms to include\n\u201cracially/ethnically diverse candidates\u201d in its pool of candidates. It could simply mean that those\ncandidates did not advance past the larger candidate pool.\n\nPlaintiffs further argue that the Inclusion Statement is false or misleading because the\nGovernance Committee \u201ceither has no intention to actually nominate [racially and ethnically\ndiverse] persons to its Board or it engages in efforts to thwart the nomination of such persons.\u201d\nUd.). The Proxy statement, however, does not state or suggest that the Governance Committee\nwill in fact nominate a racially or ethnically diverse person to its Board, only that it will include\nsuch persons in the candidate pool. \u201cThe fundamental purpose of the Securities Exchange Act is\nto implement \u2018a philosophy of full disclosure;\u2019 once full and fair disclosure has occurred, the\nfairness of the terms of the transaction is beyond the scope of the Act.\u201d Crafimatic Sec. Litig. v.\n\nKrafisow, 890 F.2d 628, 638 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nBecause Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that the Inclusion Statement is false or\nmisleading, the portion of the Section 14(a) claim based on this statement is dismissed. See\nLaborers\u2019 Local #231 Pension Fund v. Cowan, 300 F. Supp. 3d 597, 606-09 (D. Del. 2018)\n(dismissing Section 14(a) claim quibbling with the accuracy of a company\u2019s financial projections\nbecause the proxy did not represent that the projections were accurate, only that they had been\nprovided to a potential buyer, and plaintiffs did not allege that the projections disclosed in the\nProxy were not the same as the ones given to the buyer). Although I doubt that Plaintiffs can assert\na Section 14(a) claim based on the Inclusion Statement, the claim is dismissed without prejudice.\n\n3. Proxy Access Rules and Term Limits\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Proxies were misleading because they failed to disclose (i) that\n\u201cthe purpose and effect of [the Company\u2019s] \u2018proxy access\u2019 rules ... was to inhibit the nomination\nand election of Blacks and minorities to the Board,\u201d? and (ii) \u201cthat the purpose of the lack of term\nlimits is to entrench the current directors in office and prevent African Americans and minorities\nfrom having fair opportunities to be elected to the Board.\u201d (DL. 1 \u20ac\u00a7 104-112, 119(b)).\n\nThere is no duty under \u00a7 14(a) to disclose all material information. Jn re Keryx Biopharm.,\nInc., 454 F. Supp. 3d 407, 415 (D. Del. 2020); Heinze v. Tesco Corp., 971 F.3d 475, 483 (5th Cir.\n2020) (\u201cThe texts of Section 14(a) and SEC Rule 14a-9 do not provide a freestanding cause of\naction to challenge any and all material omissions from proxy statements.\u201d).\n\nInstead, an omission of information from a proxy statement is actionable only if \u201cSEC\nregulations specifically require disclosure of the omitted information, or the omission makes other\n\n3 \u201cProxy access\u201d rules set forth a company\u2019s requirements for a stockholder to nominate a\n\ndirector to the company\u2019s board of directors. (D.I. 30 at 21). For example, at the time the\nComplaint was filed, a Qualcomm stockholder may include director nominees in a proxy only if\nthe stockholder \u201cown{[s] at least 3% of [the Company\u2019s] outstanding common stock continuously\nfor at least the previous three years.\u201d (D.I. 1 | 104).\n\nstatements in the proxy statement materially false or misleading.\u201d Seinfeld v. Becherer, 461 F.3d\n365, 369 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting Resnik v. Swartz, 303 F.3d 147, 151 (2d Cir.2002)). If the claim\ndepends on the latter, then the complaint must point to the \u201cprecise statement\u201d in the proxy\nrendered false or misleading by the alleged omission. See Heinze, 971 F.3d at 480 (\u201c[F]or\nomission-based claims, the plaintiff must identify specific \u2018statements therein\u2019 that are rendered\n\u2018false or misleading\u2019 by the alleged omissions.\u201d); Hysong, 2011 WL 5509100, at *6 (\u201c[I]n order\nto plead facts to sufficiently allege ... a section 14(a) claim, a plaintiff must identify a precise\nstatement in the proxy that is either affirmatively misleading in and of itself, or is rendered\nmisleading by operation of a materially omitted fact.\u201d).\n\n\u201cTo the extent plaintiffs contend it is enough for a plaintiff simply to allege that material\ninformation was omitted from a proxy statement in order to state a claim under \u00a7 14(a), plaintiffs\nare incorrect.\u201d Louisiana Mun. Police Employees Ret. Sys. v. Cooper Indus. pic, 2012 WL\n4958561, at *8 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 16, 2012). \u201cOmissions constitute violations of \u00a7 14(a) only if they\nare both material and make other statements false or misleading.\u201d Keryx, 454 F. Supp. 3d at 415\n(brackets omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nPlaintiffs have not cited an SEC Rule that specifically required Defendants to include in\ntheir Proxies a statement that the purpose and effect of the proxy access rules and the lack of term\nlimits is, as Plaintiffs allege, to \u201cinhibit the nomination and election of Blacks and minorities to\nthe Board.\u201d Thus, to be actionable, the Plaintiffs must identify other statements in the Proxy that\nthese omissions rendered materially false and misleading. Plaintiffs have failed to do so.\nTherefore, the portion of their Section 14(a) claim based on the proxy access rules and term limits\nis dismissed without prejudice. See Keryx, 454 F. Supp. 3d at 415 (holding that plaintiffs\u2019 failure\n\nto allege that the omission rendered a statement in the Proxy false or misleading was \u201cfatal to their\nclaim\u2019); Cooper., 2012 WL 4958561, at *10 (dismissing claim because \u201cplaintiffs have not\nidentified in their Complaint ... any specific statement or statements in the Proxy that are rendered\nfalse or misleading by operation of the alleged omissions).\n\n4. Executive Compensation\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the Proxies misrepresented the weight the Compensation Committee\ngave to an executive\u2019s efforts to increase diversity when approving the amount of the executive\u2019s\ncompensation. (D.I. 34 at 25; DI. 1 \u00a7 113-16). According to the Complaint, \u201cIn reality, those\nkinds of salutary and important goals do not count for any kind of significant weighting towards\nthe amount of compensation that gets awarded to executives at Qualcomm. In fact, at Qualcomm\nover 90% of executive compensation is based on the Company\u2019s financial performance.\u201d (D.L. 1\n\u00a7 116).\n\nPlaintiffs have not identified a single statement in the Proxies that their allegations would\nrender false or misleading. Each Proxy contained around thirty-pages disclosing in detail the\nmultiple elements of an executive\u2019s compensation package, including why each element was\nawarded to a particular executive, the amounts awarded under each element, and how those\namounts were calculated.* (D.I. 31-1, Ex. D at 47-75; Id., Ex. G at 36-73). Not a single page\nmentions \u201cdiversity\u201d in any context, nor are there any claims that the Compensation Committee\ngave any weight to an executive\u2019s efforts to increase diversity when determining compensation\nlevels. (See DI. 1 9 114-15).\n\nTo the contrary, both Proxies clearly stated what Plaintiffs themselves allege \u2014 that over\n\n90% of executive compensation is based on the Company\u2019s financial performance. (See D.I. 31-\n\n4 \u201cTf the Complaint specifically references or quotes documents that are subsequently\nattached in defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and there is no dispute as to their authenticity, a court\nmay consider them without converting the motion to one for summary judgment.\u201d Hurst v. Merck\n& Co., 1996 WL 527053, at *3 (D.N.J. Mar. 18, 1996).\n\n1, Ex. D at 63 (2020 Proxy stating that: \u201cFor fiscal 2019, 94% of our CEO\u2019s target TDC [Total\nDirect Compensation] and 91% of our other NEOs\u2019 [Named Executive Officers\u2019 | aggregate target\nTDC was based on Company performance\u201d); Jd., Ex. G at 59 (2019 Proxy stating that: \u201cFor fiscal\n2018, 94% of our CEO\u2019s target TDC and 90% of our other NEOs\u2019 aggregate target TDC was based\non Company performance.\u201d)).\n\nThis means that no more than 10% of an executive\u2019s compensation could be based on\nefforts to increase diversity. Plaintiffs cannot state a Section 14(a) claim \u201cwhere the omitted fact\ncan be determined by simple arithmetic and all the information necessary to perform the\ncalculation was fully disclosed.\u201d Hurwitz v. LRR Energy, L.P., 241 F.Supp.3d 491, 500-01 (D.\nDel. 2017). Accordingly, the Proxies did not misrepresent how much weight the Compensation\nCommittee gave to an executives\u2019 efforts to increase diversity when making compensation\ndecisions. Because Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege that the Proxies misrepresented how\nthe Governance Committee made decisions regarding executive compensation, this portion of the\nSection 14(a) claim is dismissed. Although I doubt that Plaintiffs can assert a Section 14(a) claim\nbased on the executive compensation disclosures, the claim is dismissed without prejudice.\n\n5. Failures of Oversight\n\nFinally, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Section 14(a) by failing to disclose that\n\u201cthe Company was allowing unlawful and discriminatory practices to proliferate at the Company,\nthus exposing the Company to significant risk.\u201d (D.L. 34 at 26; see also DI. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 119(f)-(k)). This\nSection 14(a) claim, based on the omission of alleged oversight failures, rehashes the same\nallegations Plaintiffs assert under their breach of fiduciary duty claims. \u201cThe law is well-\nestablished,\u201d however, \u201cthat bootstrapping a federal securities claim to a cause of action for breach\nof fiduciary duty is not permissible.\u201d Behrmann y. Brandt, 2020 WL 4432536, at *18 (D. Del.\n\nJuly 31, 2020); see Craftmatic, 890 F.2d at 639 (\u201c[Al]llegations of failure to disclose\nmismanagement alone do not state a claim under federal securities law.\u201d); Kooker, 497 F. Supp.\n3d at 9 (same).\n\nPlaintiffs have not convinced the Court that their Section 14(a) based on oversight failures\nfits within the exception where such claims can proceed in parallel to a fiduciary duty claim. See\nIn re Countrywide Fin. Corp. Derivative Litig., 554 F. Supp. 2d 1044, 1077 (C.D. Cal. 2008)\n(allowing Section 14(a) claim to proceed where corresponding fiduciary duty claim was \u201cof\nsecondary importance\u201d); Inre Wells Fargo & Co. S\u2019holder Derivative Litig., 282 F. Supp. 3d 1074,\n1103 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (same). Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 14(a) claim based on the failure to\ndisclose inadequate oversight of the Company is dismissed without prejudice.\n\nB. State Law Claims\n\n\u201cThe decision whether to initiate or pursue a lawsuit on behalf of the corporation is\ngenerally within the power and responsibility of the board of directors.\u201d In re Citigroup Inc.\nSvholder Deriv. Litig., 964 A.2d 106, 120 (Del. Ch. 2009) (citing 8 Del. C. \u00a7 141(a)). A\nstockholder plaintiff can pursue claims belonging to the corporation if (1) the corporation\u2019s\ndirectors wrongfully refused a demand to authorize the corporation to bring the suit or (2) a demand\nwould have been futile because the directors were incapable of impartially considering the\ndemand. See Rales v. Blasband, 634 A.2d 927, 932 (Del. 1993). Because the Plaintiffs did not\nmake a demand on Qualcomm\u2019s Board, the Complaint must plead \u201cparticularized facts showing\nthat demand ... was excused.\u201d Genworth Fin., Inc. Consol. Derivative Litig., 2021 WL 4452338,\nat *9 (Del. Ch. Sept. 29, 2021); see also Del. Ct. Ch. R. 23.1.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has recently adopted a three-part test as \u201cthe universal test\n\nfor assessing whether demand should be excused as futile.\u201d United Food & Commercial Workers\n\n10\n\nUnion v. Zuckerberg, 2021 WL 4344361, at *16 (Del. Sept. 23, 2021).> Courts must ask the\nfollowing three questions \u201con a director-by-director basis\u201d when evaluating allegations of demand\nfutility:\n\n(i) whether the director received a material personal benefit from the alleged\nmisconduct that is the subject of the litigation demand;\n\nGi) whether the director faces a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the\nclaims that would be the subject of the litigation demand; and\n\n(iii) whether the director lacks independence from someone who received a\nmaterial personal benefit from the alleged misconduct that would be the subject\nof the litigation demand or who would face a substantial likelihood of liability\non any of the claims that are the subject of the litigation demand.\nId. at *17. \u201cIf the answer to any of the questions is \u2018yes\u2019 for at least half of the members of the\ndemand board, then demand is excused as futile.\u201d /d. This analysis is conducted not only on a\n\u201cdirector-by-director basis,\u201d see Zuckerberg, 2021 WL 4344361, at *16, but also on a \u201cclaim-by-\nclaim basis.\u201d Beam v. Stewart, 833 A.2d 961, 977 n.48 (Del. Ch. 2003), aff'd, 845 A.2d 1040\n(Del. 2004). Here, the Complaint contains five claims. Each claim is addressed in turn.\n1. Counts I and II \u2014 Fiduciary Duties\nCounts I and II of the Complaint assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and\nabetting breach of fiduciary duty, respectively. (D.I. 1 \u00a7\u00a7f 181-89). At the time this action was\ncommenced, Qualcomm\u2019s Board consisted of eleven members. (/d. at \u00a7 162). In addition,\n\nQualcomm\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation contains an exculpatory provision pursuant to 8 Del. C.\n\n\u00a7 102(b)(7).\u00a9  (D.I. 31-1, Ex. H at VID. Thus, for demand to be excused, Plaintiffs must\n\n5 The Delaware Supreme Court issued the Zuckerberg opinion after briefing on the motion\nto dismiss was completed. Both sides notified the Court that the opinion did not change the\nanalysis set forth in their briefs. (See D.I. 38; D.I. 39).\n6 On a motion to dismiss, the Court may take judicial notice of matters of public record,\nincluding a certificate of incorporation. See, e.g., In re Wheelabrator Techs., Inc. S\u2019holders Litig.,\n1992 WL 212595, at *11-12 (Del. Ch. Sept. 1, 1992).\n\n11\n\ndemonstrate that six out of the eleven directors are either interested or not independent with respect\ntoa fiduciary duty claim involving a breach of loyalty or good faith. (D.I. 34 at 8). In other words,\nPlaintiffs must allege with particularity facts creating a reasonable inference that each of the\ndirectors acted with scienter. See Shaev v. Baker, 2017 WL 1735573, at *10 (N.D. Cal. May 4,\n2017) (explaining that plaintiffs must allege scienter when company\u2019s charter contains a \u00a7\n102(b)(7) exculpatory provision).\n\nPlaintiffs proceed under the second prong of the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s Zuckerberg\ntest. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that demand is excused because the Director Defendants face a\nsubstantial likelihood of liability for breaching their fiduciary duties by \u201cengaging in and tacitly\nendorsing illegal conduct.\u201d (DI. 34 at IV.B.2). The Complaint alleges, \u201cThe challenged\nmisconduct at the heart of this case involves the direct facilitation of illegal activity, including the\nBoard knowingly and/or consciously presiding over the Company\u2019s discrimination against Blacks\nand minorities at Qualcomm.\u201d (D.I. 1 166). According to Plaintiffs, demand is futile because\nthe Board was \u201crepeatedly made aware\u201d of the Company\u2019s \u201csystemic violations of applicable laws\nand regulations\u201d and nevertheless chose a \u201c\u2018do nothing\u2019 strategy.\u201d (/d. at J] 166-70). In the\nalternative, Plaintiffs allege that demand is futile because the Board took a \u201cdirect role[] in\nimplementing a business strategy designed to ignore or otherwise circumvent federal and state\n\nlaws prohibiting discrimination.\u201d (/d. at \u00a7 177). Plaintiffs contend that their allegations can be\n\n7 The relief sought in the Complaint reaffirms that the focus of this case is racial/ethnic\ndiversity. It seeks mandatory injunctive relief that will replace three directors with \u201ctwo Black\npersons and one other minority\u201d; require the publication of annual diversity reports that provide\nhiring, pay, and promotion statistics \u201cof all minorities\u201d; create an $800 million fund to hire,\npromote, and mentor \u201cBlack and minority employees\u201d; and set \u201cspecific goals with respect to the\nnumber of Blacks and minority employees to hire at the Company over the next five years.\u201d (D.I.\n1 Prayer for Relief  B.1, 4-7).\n\n12\n\nassessed either as a Caremark-type oversight claim or as an Aronson-type board-decision claim.\u00ae\n(DI. 34 at 12).\n\nThe primary problem with Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint is that it lacks the particularized\nallegations necessary to pass muster under Rule 23.1. First, Plaintiffs never identify any specific\nlaws governing racial/ethnic diversity or discrimination that were violated.? Second, if these laws\nwere violated (and repeatedly, as Plaintiffs allege), Plaintiffs never allege the who, what, where,\nwhen, and how of those violations. Third, if the Board decided to implement a business strategy\ndesigned to circumvent federal and state laws prohibiting racial discrimination, there are no\nparticularized facts regarding either the decision or the strategy. When was the decision made?\nWhat exactly was the strategy? How would it circumvent federal and state laws? Finally, if the\nBoard was instead consciously disregarding its duty of oversight, when and how did each member\nof the Board become aware that laws governing diversity and/or discrimination were being\nviolated? And what information specifically were they given about the violations?\n\nWithout these details, this case is nothing like Rosenbloom or Shaeyv, as Plaintiffs contend.\n(See D.I. 34 at 10). In Rosenbloom, Allergan received several warning letters from the FDA for\nviolating federal laws governing the off-label marketing of Botox and eventually pleaded guilty in\na criminal case based on those violations. Rosenbloom v. Pyott, 765 F.3d 1137, 1140, 1143 (9th\nCir. 2014). Later, Plaintiffs sued for breaches of fiduciary duties alleging that the defendants either\n8 A Caremark claim \u201crequires a showing that directors knew they were not discharging their\nfiduciary obligations or that they demonstrated a conscious disregard for their duties.\u201d In re Intel\nCorp. Derivative Litig., 621 F. Supp. 2d 165, 174 (D. Del. 2009) (emphases in original). In other\nwords, a Caremark claim alleges a failure of oversight involving \u201cnot merely inattention, but actual\n\nscienter.\u201d Okla. Firefighters Pension & Ret. Sys. v. Corbat, 2017 WL 6452240, at *1 (Del. Ch.\nDec. 18, 2017).\n\n9 At least one court has held that Delaware law itself does not impose a fiduciary duty to\n\nensure diversity. See Falat, 2021 WL 1558940, at *5 (\u201cWith respect to [Plaintiff's] claims about\nracial diversity, Delaware imposes no duty to maintain diversity on a Board of Directors.\u201d).\n\n13\ndeliberately promoted or consciously disregarded the illegal off-label promotion of Botox. Jd. at\n1148-49. Plaintiffs not only pointed to Allergan\u2019s prior runs-in with the law to provide\nparticularized allegations that the Company illegally marketed off-label uses of Botox, but also\nprovided lengthy, detailed allegations regarding multiple programs at Allergan designed to\naggressively promote the illegal off-label sales of Botox. Jd. at 1142-44. Similarly, in Shaev, the\nillegality of the conduct at the heart of complaint was clear \u2014 the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau each issued consent orders because Wells\nFargo employees were committing fraud by opening tens of thousands of deposit accounts and\ncredit cards in their customers\u2019 names, without their customers\u2019 knowledge or consent. Shaev,\n2017 WL 1735573, at *4-5.\n\nHere, Plaintiffs argue that the Board was aware of the unspecified but pervasive legal\nviolations because \u201cQualcomm \u2019s Board is all White,\u201d and, \u201cAfrican Americans comprise only\n1.5% of the workforce, despite making up 13% of the U.S. population.\u201d!\u00b0 (D.L. 34 at 13-14, citing\nD.I. 1410). These allegations raise questions. But, sitting alone without any other particularized\nallegations, Plaintiffs have failed to create a reasonable inference that there is pervasive illegal\nracial discrimination at Qualcomm that the Board either consciously disregarded or tacitly\nendorsed. Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed to plead that the Director Defendants face a substantial\n\nlikelihood of liability on the fiduciary duty claims such that demand should be excused. Because\n\n10 Defendants take issue with the contention that the Board is \u201call White,\u201d stating that the\ncontention is contradicted by the Complaint itself. (See D.I. 35 at 4 (citing D.I. 1 9 3)).\n\nSeparately, while I accept as true the statistics in Plaintiffs\u2019 statistical comparison between\nthe percentage of African Americans in Qualcomm\u2019s workforce and the percentage of African\nAmericans in the U.S. population, Plaintiffs provide no basis for believing this is a meaningful\ncomparison. Qualcomm\u2019s workforce is not limited to the United States. As the Complaint itself\nalleges, Qualcomm is a \u201cmultinational corporation\u201d with a \u201cworldwide talent acquisition staff.\u201d\n(D.I. 1 ff] 33, 82). Facile comparisons of groups drawn from different populations do not make\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations more plausible,\n\n14\ndemand was not excused and Plaintiffs failed to make a demand, Counts I and II of the Complaint\nare dismissed pursuant to Rule 23.1 without prejudice.!!\n\n2. Count II -\u2014 Abuse of Control\n\nCount III appears to be nothing more than a duplication of the breach of fiduciary duty\nclaim under Count I. Count III is labeled \u201cAbuse of Control\u201d and alleges, \u201cBy virtue of their\npositions and financial holdings at Qualcomm, the Director Defendants exercised control over\nQualcomm and its operations, and owed duties as controlling persons to Qualcomm not to use their\npositions of control for their own personal interests and contrary to Qualcomm\u2019s interests.\u201d (D.I.\n14191). The Complaint itself does not identify any legal source for this purported claim. (See\nid. at FY 190-93).\n\nTo me, the claim appears to be nothing more than a claim for the breach of the fiduciary\nduty of loyalty under a different label. Under Delaware law, a director using his position of control\n\u201cto advance his personal interests\u201d at the expense of the company\u2019s interests was \u201cthe\nquintessential breach of the duty of loyalty.\u201d CertiSign Holding, Inc. v. Kulikovsky, 2018 WL\n2938311, at *16 (Del. Ch. Une 7, 2018). Plaintiffs presented no argument regarding Count III in\ntheir opposition brief. (See DI. 34). Accordingly, Count III is dismissed without leave to amend\nas it is meaninglessly duplicative.\n\n3. Count IV \u2014 Unjust Enrichment\n\nThe bulk of Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition brief argues why demand is excused as to the breach of\n\nfiduciary duty and Section 14(a) claims. (See D.I. 34 at 21-22). But demand futility analysis is\n\nu As Delaware courts have repeated for decades, \u201cderivative plaintiffs may believe it is\ndifficult to meet the particularization requirement of [Rule 23.1] because they are not entitled to\ndiscovery to assist their compliance with Rule 23.1,\u201d but \u201cthey have many avenues available to\nobtain information bearing on the subject of their claims.\u201d Rales, 634 A.2d at 934 n. 10. For\nexample, \u201ca stockholder... may use the summary procedure embodied in 8 Del. C. \u00a7 220 to\ninvestigate the possibility of corporate wrongdoing.\u201d Jd.\n\n15\n\nconducted \u201con a claim-by-claim basis.\u201d Beam, 833 A.2d at 977. Count IV asserts a claim for\nunjust enrichment. (D.I. 1 ff 194-98). Plaintiffs barely address why demand is excused as to the\nunjust enrichment claim, and then only to discuss Defendant Mollenkopf. (See D.I. 34 at 21-22).\nEven if Plaintiffs are correct that Defendant Mollenkopf was interested and not independent with\nrespect to Count IV, that is only one director out of eleven. One is not a majority. See Zuckerberg,\n2021 WL 4344361, at *16 (explaining that demand futility requires a majority of the board to be\ninterested or lack independence). Because Plaintiffs have not shown that demand was excused as\nfutile for Count IV, Count IV is dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Rule 23.1,\n4. Count V \u2014 Section 14(a)\n\nCount V asserts a derivative claim on behalf of the Company for violation of Section 14(a)\nof the Exchange Act against all Defendants. (D.I. 1 {] 47, Count V). Because Count V is being\ndismissed for failure to state a claim, the Court need not determine whether demand would be\nfutile. See Beam, 833 A.2d at 976-77 (stating that the Court need not address demand futility for\nclaims already being dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6)).\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Complaint.\n(D.I. 29). Counts I, IL, and IV (breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary\nduties, and unjust enrichment) are dismissed without prejudice for failure to plead demand futility\npursuant to Rule 23.1. Count III (abuse of control) is dismissed without leave to amend. Count V\n(violations of Section 14(a)) is dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claim based on \u201cgoal\u201d statements is dismissed with prejudice.
