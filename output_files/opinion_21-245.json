{"case_name": "Graco Inc. et al v. Carlisle Construction Materials, LLC", "case_number": "21-245", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "03-07-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nGRACO INC. and GRACO \n1\\.1INNESOTA INC., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nCARLISLE CONSTRUCTION \nMATERIALS, LLC, \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 21-245-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nA Markman hearing for this patent case is currently scheduled for tomorrow, \nMarch 8, 2023. The disputed claim term of greatest significance is ''tangent.\" \n\"Tangent\" can be a noun or an adjective. The claims at issue use ''tangent\" only in \nthe phrase \"being tangent to,\" so ''tangent\" is clearly an adjective here. \nDefendant's proposed construction for ''tangent\" is: \"The cylindrical \nsidewall of each admission passage defines a straight line or plane that if extended \ntouches the cylindrical wall of the mixing chamber at a single point.\" D.I. 78 at 3. \nThis proposal is a declarative sentence. It is not a synonym for or a definition of \nan adjective. It does not construe any adjective, let alone the adjective ''tangent.\" \nPlaintiffs had proposed in the Joint Claim Construction Brief that I construe \n''tangent\" to mean \"offset from a radial position.\" D .I. 71 at 15. Grammatically, \nthat construction makes sense. Substantively, it does not, see generally D.I. 71 at 24-5 5; and for that reason, I am not surprised that Plaintiffs have now dropped that \nproposed construction, see D.I. 79 at 1-2. \nPlaintiffs now propose to construe \"tangent\" as: ''the outer edges of the \nsidewalls of the admission passages are aligned with the outer edge of the mixing \nchamber.\" D.I. 79 at 1-2. This independent clause is neither an adjectival phrase \nnor a definition of an adjective. \nPlaintiffs say that they are making their new proposal \"[i]n an effort to \nnarrow the issues for the Court[.]\" D .I. 79 at 2. But Defendant has not had an \nopportunity to address Plaintiffs' proposal in briefing, so the proposal does not \nmake it easier for the Court to prepare for the Markman hearing. On the contrary, \nit puts the Court in the position of having to try to figure out what Defendant will \nsay in response to this new proposal. \nPlaintiffs first made their new proposal during the \"meet and confer\" \ndiscussion required by paragraph 13 of the Revised Scheduling Order. D.I. 61 \nif 13. That discussion occurred during a phone call that lasted a mere 15 minutes, \nand it appears from the letters about claim construction filed by the parties as \nrecently as yesterday that there have been no follow-up in-person or telephonic \ndiscussions to narrow the issues related to \"tangent.\" See D.I. 79; D.I. 86. \nNow therefore, at Wilmington this Seventh day of March in 2023, it is \nHEREBY ORDERED that: \n2 1. The Markman hearing is canceled until further notice; \n2. Each side's lawyers who were going to argue the \"tangent\" term shall \nmeet in person in Wilmington tomorrow in lieu of the scheduled \nMarkman hearing and attempt to narrow the issues related to the meaning \nof that term; \n3. The parties shall file no later than March 14, 2023 a joint status report \nthat identifies who participated in tomorrow's meeting, how long it \nlasted, and where it occurred. If the parties have not reached agreement \non the construction of \"tangent\" by March 14, they shall propose in the \njoint status report a grammatically appropriate construction of \"tangent.\" \nCIIlEF JUDGE \n3 "}
