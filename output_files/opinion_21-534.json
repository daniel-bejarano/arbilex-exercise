(D.I. 32 )  For the reasons set forth  below, the Court recommends th at Defendants\u2019 \nMotion be  GRANTED.1   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background  \nPlaintiffs allege that Mr. Storms, through his compa ny BearBox, developed proprietary  \ntechnology for energy- efficient cryptocurrency mining systems  (the \u201cBearBox Technology\u201d) .  \n(D.I. 19 at \u00b6 \u00b6 2, 27- 28)  In May 2019, Mr. Storms attended an industry conference to promote the \n \n1  On September 10, 2021, United States District Judge Maryellen Noreika referred \nthis case to the Court to resolve all pre -trial matters up to and including expert discovery matters, \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b).  (D.I. 57)  2 \n BearBox Technology.  ( Id. at \u00b6  31)  Mr. Storms and Mr. McNamara met at the conference, and  \nMr. McNamara expressed interest in the BearBox Technology .  (Id. at \u00b6 32)  Mr. Storms \nprovided details regarding the BearBox Technology to Mr. McNamara over dinner and through \nother conversations , e-mails and text messages during the conference.  ( Id.)  Conversations \nbetween Mr. Storms and Mr. McNamara at times occurred in front of other conference attendees.  \n(D.I. 2 8 at 27 at \u00b6 43; D.I. 41 at \u00b6  43)  Mr. Storms told Mr. McNamara that the BearBox \nTechnology was confidential and Mr. McNamara assured him that he would keep the disclosures confidential.  ( D.I. 19 at \u00b6 32)  Following the conference, Mr. Storms provided annotated system \ndiagrams, component specifications and modeled data sets to Mr. McN amara in reliance on M r. \nMcNamara\u2019s assurances of confidentiality.  ( Id. at \u00b6 33)  Mr. McNamara then ended \ncommunications with Mr. Storms.  ( Id. at \u00b6 34)   \n In October  and December 2019, Defendants filed U.S. patent applications , which \nPlaintiffs allege wrongfully claim the BearBox Technology.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 37- 39)  The applications  \nname Mr. McNamara and Mr. Cline as the sole joint inventors .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39)   On March 31, \n2020, United States Patent No. 10,608,433 (the \u201c'433 patent \u201d) issued, claiming inventions that \nallegedly fall within the scope of the BearBox Technology and naming Mr. McNamara and Mr. Cline as the sole inventors .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 40 -41)  Mr. McNamara and Mr. Cline assigned their rights \nin the '433 pa tent to Lancium.  ( Id. at \u00b6 42) \n On August 14, 2020, Lancium filed a  patent infringement lawsuit against Layer1 \nTechnologies  (\u201cLayer1\u201d)  asserting the '433 patent.  ( Id. at \u00b6 44)  The lawsuit settled a few \nmonths later, with Layer1 taking a license to the '433 patent.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 49- 50) \n Any f urther relevant facts will be set out as needed in Section III.  3 \n B. Procedural History  \n Plaintiffs filed this action on April 14, 2021.  (D.I. 1 )  On May 24, 2021, Plaintiffs filed \nthe operative Amended Complaint, (D.I. 19), and on June 25, 2021, Defendants filed the \noperative Amended  Answer to Amended Complaint and Counterclaims, (D.I. 28).  On June 28, \n2021, Defendants filed the instant Motion , (D.I. 32), which was fully briefed as of July 30, 2021, \n(D.I. 46).   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n In evaluating a  motion  for judgment  on the  pleadings  brought  pursuant  to Rule  12(c) , the \nCourt uses the same standard that  applies to a motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  See Wolfington v.  Reconstructive Orthopaedic  Assocs.  II PC, \n935 F.3d 187, 195 (3d Cir. 2019).  It must view all factual allegations in a complaint in the light \nmost favorable to the non -moving party, and it may not grant the motion \u201cunless the movant \nclearly establishes that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.\u201d  Id.  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In deciding \nsuch a motion, the Court may consider only the pleadings, the exhibits attached thereto, matters \nof public record and undisputedly authentic documents integral to the pleadings.  I d.   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint alleges five Counts:  Count I \u2019s claim for \u201cCorrection of \nInventorship for the '433 Patent:  Austin Storms as Sole Inventor[,]\u201d  (D.I . 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 51- 54); Count \nII\u2019s claim for \u201c In the Alternative, Correction of Inventorship for the '433 P atent:  Austin Storms \nas Joint Inventor  with the Currently Named Inventors[,] \u201d (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 55- 58); Count III\u2019s claim for \n\u201cConversion by Lancium, McNamara, and Cline[,] \u201d (id. at \u00b6\u00b6  59-62); Count IV\u2019s claim for 4 \n \u201cUnjust  Enrichment by Lancium, McNamara, and Cline[,] \u201d (id. at \u00b6\u00b6  63-69); and Count V\u2019s \nclaim for \u201cNegligent Misrepresentation by Lancium and McNamara[,]\u201d ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 70- 73).   \nDefendants move to dismiss Count III, Count IV and Count V  (the \u201cstate law claims\u201d) .  \n(D.I. 33 at 1)2  Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are preempted by federal \npatent law .3  (Id. at 1-2)  Additionally, they assert that, to the extent any of the claims are not \npreempted, they otherwise suffer f rom fatal flaws that warrant their dismissal as a matter of law.  \n(Id.)  The Court w ill assess each state law claim in turn .   \nA. Conversion  (Count II I) \n \n2  Counts I and II are not at issue in Defendants\u2019 Motion.  (D.I. 33 at 1)  \n \n3  Federal law can preempt state law in three ways \u2014explicit, field or conflict \npreemption.  Ultra -Precision Mfg., Ltd. v. Ford Motor Co., 411 F.3d 1369, 1377 (Fed. Cir. \n2005).  This case implicates conflict preemption, ( see D.I. 42 at 6; D.I. 46 at 3), which \u201cinvolves \na consideration of whether [a state]  law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and \nexecution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress[,]\u201d Aronson v. Quick Point Pencil Co., \n440 U.S. 257, 262 (1979)  (internal quotation marks and citat ions omitted) ; see also Ultra -\nPrecision Mfg., 411 F.3d at 1377.  The law of t he United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit applies to the issue of whether federal patent law preempts a state law claim.  Ultra -\nPrecision Mfg., 411 F.3d at 1376.  The Federal Circuit has explained that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff bases its [state law] tort action on conduct that is protected or governed by federal patent law, then the plaintiff may not invoke the state law remedy, which must be preempted for conflict with federal patent law.\u201d  Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. Harmonic Design, Inc., 153 F.3d 1318, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1998), overruled on other grounds by Midwest Indus., Inc. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  Patent laws will not preempt state law cl aims if such claims include \nadditional elements not found in the federal patent law cause of action, as long as the claims are not \u201can impermissible attempt to offer patent- like protection to subject matter addressed by \nfederal law.\u201d  Rodime PLC v. Seagate  Tech., Inc. , 174 F.3d 1294, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  The \nFederal Circuit has held that \u201c\u2018 the field of federal patent law preempts any state law that purports \nto define rights based on inventorship.\u2019 \u201d  HIF Bio, Inc. v. Yung Shin Pharms. Indus. Co., 600 \nF.3d 1347, 1352- 53 (Fed. Cir. 2010)  (quoting Univ. of Colo. Found. v . Am. Cyanamid Co., 196 \nF.3d 1366, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ); see also, e.g., Speedfit LLC v. Woodway USA, Inc., 226 F. \nSupp. 3d 149, 160 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (explaining that \u201caccording to controlling precedent, a state law claim that either seeks \u2018patent -like\u2019 protections not provided by federal patent law, or turns \non a determination of inventorship, is preempted by federal patent law\u201d).     5 \n Courts have found that claims for conversion4 that are dependent on a determination of \npatent inventorship are generally preempted by federal patent law.  See Gerawan Farming, Inc. \nv. Rehrig P ac. Co., No. 1:11- cv-01273- LJO BAM , 2012 WL 691758, at *7 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 2, \n2012)  (citing cases) .5  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim requires a \ndetermination of inventorship and is therefore preempted.  (D.I. 33 at 7- 9; D.I. 46 at 2)  The \nCourt agrees.   \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint begins by alleging that the case \u201cis about the Defendants\u2019 \ntheft of inventions that rightfully belong to Plaintiffs [,]\u201d and  Plaintiffs\u2019  conversion claim begins \nby incorporating by reference the allegations from Plaintiffs\u2019 correction of inventorship claims.  \n(D.I.  19 at \u00b6\u00b6  1, 59 (emphasis added) )  From there, t he conversion claim alleges that  \u201cDefendants \nassumed dominion and control over the BearBox Technology by claiming it as their own in the \n'433 patent \u201d and that \u201c[t]hrough their wrongful conduct i n obtaining the ' 433 [p]atent and \nclaiming the BearBox Technology as their own, [] Defendants have wrongfully obtained the \npurported ability to exclude Plaintiffs and others from using the BearBox Technology.\u201d   (Id. at \u00b6 \n61 (emphasis added) )  The harm that Plaintiffs allege as a result of the conversion is the loss of \n\u201cvaluable intellectual property [.]\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 62)  This is clearly a claim that, by its wording, is \n \n4  At least for purposes of this Motion, both parties agre e that Louisiana law applies \nto the state law claims at issue here.  (D.I. 33 at 13; D.I. 42 at 10)  Under Louisiana law, a claim \nfor conversion requires proof of:  (1) the plaintiff\u2019s right to possess; (2) that the defendant\u2019s use was inconsistent with th e plaintiff\u2019s right of ownership; and (3) that the defendant\u2019s use \nconstituted a wrongful taking.  Mabile v. BP, P.L.C., CIVIL ACTION NO. 11 -1783, 2016 WL \n5231839, at *21 (E.D. La. Sept. 22, 2016). \n \n5  On the other hand, conversion claims that are based on a non- patent -ownership \ntheory of conversion are generally not preempted by federal patent law.  Gerawan Farming, Inc., \n2012 WL 691758, at *7.   \n 6 \n dependent on a determination of patent inventorship.  I t is thus preempted by federal patent  law.6  \nSee, e.g., Speedfit LLC v. Woodway USA, Inc., 226 F. Supp. 3d 149, 160 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) \n(concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim was preempted by federal patent law , where \nplaintiffs\u2019 \u201cassertion of ownership over the subject matter of the Woodway Patents, which underlies their claim of conversion, clearly turns on a determination of inventorship\u201d ); Gerawan \nFarming, Inc., 2012 WL 691758, at *7 (concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s  conversion claim was \npreempted by federal patent law , where the claim alleged that the defendant \u201csubstantially \ninterfered with [the plaintiff\u2019s] rightful property by omitting [the plaintiff] as an inventor \u201d and \naccordingly \u201cwrongfully exercised control over [the plaintiff\u2019s] rights in the . . . '293 Patent\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Gen. Elec. Co. v. Wilkins , No. 1:10- cv-00674-\nOWW- JLT, 2011 WL 3163348, at *9 (E.D. Cal. July 26, 2011) (finding that the defendant\u2019s \nconversion claim was preempted , where it sought \u201ccompensation for [p]lai ntiff\u2019s purported \ninterference with [d]efendant\u2019s inventorship interests in the intellectual property embodied in the '565 and '985 patents; in other words, [d]efendant seeks patent -like protection under the guise of \nthe tort of conversion\u201d).\n7   \n \n6  In their briefing, Plaintiffs try to recast the  conversion claim as one \u201cbased on acts \nof misappropriating documents and information[ .]\u201d  (D.I. 42 at 7)   But, as shown above, th at is \nnot accurate.  Th e actual allegations in Count III  make clear that Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim is \n\u201cbased on the alleged right to ownership of the '433 patent due to Storms \u2019 alleged inventorship.\u201d   \n(D.I. 46 at 4)  \n \n7  Moreover, t he fact that Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim seeks damages amounting to \nthe loss of \u201cvaluable intellectual property from which Plaintiffs would have derived substantial \nrevenue via licensing and/or selli ng patented products [,]\u201d (D.I. 19 at \u00b6  62), demonstrates that it is \npatent -like in nature, see Speedfit  LLC , 226 F. Supp. 3d at 160.  That is another reason why the \nclaim is preempted .  (D.I. 46 at 4)  \n 7 \n Because t he Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim is preempted, it need not now \nfurther evaluate Defendants\u2019 additional argument s for dismissal of the claim.   \nB. Unjust Enrichment (Count IV) \nThe next claim, in Count IV, is a claim for unjust enrichment.8  As with conversion \nclaims, unjust enrichment claims  that are based on a determination of patent inventorship are \ngenerally preempted by federal patent law.  See, e.g., Tavory v. NTP, Inc., 297 F. App\u2019x 976, \n983-84 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (finding that an unjust enrichment claim was preempted by federal \npatent law where the \u201cdispositive issue [was plaintiff\u2019s] alleged co -inventorship\u201d);  Heat Techs., \nInc. v. Papierfabrik Aug. Koehler SE , Civil Action No. 1:18- cv-01229- SDG, 2020 WL \n12309512, at *4 (N.D. Ga. June 5, 2020) (citing cases ); James v. J2 Cloud Servs. Inc., Case No. \n2:16- cv-05769- CAS(PJWx), 2018 WL 6092461, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2018).9  Defendants \n \n8  The elements of an unjust enrichment claim in Louisiana are:  (1) an enrichment \nof the defendant; (2) an impoverishment of the plaintiff; (3) a connection between the enrichment \nand the resulting impoverishment; (4) an absence of justification or cause for  the enrichment and \nimpoverishment; and (5) there must be no other remedy at law available to plaintiff.  Garber v. \nBadon & Ranier , 981 So. 2d 92, 100 ( La. Ct. App. 2008). \n \n9  On the other hand, there are some circumstances where federal courts have \nconclu ded that an unjust enrichment claim  having some connection to patent rights was not \npreempted, such as where it was alleged that defendants wrongfully obtained a patent based on \nconfidential information received from a plaintiff , and claimed ownership of i t in violation of a \ncontract.  See, e.g., Spears v. SHK Consulting & Dev ., Inc., 338 F. Supp. 3d 1272, 1277 (M.D. \nFla. 2018) ; see also Univ. of Colo. Found., Inc. v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 342 F.3d 1298, 1306- 07 \n(Fed. Cir. 2003)  (finding that an unjust enrichment claim was not preempted , where it amounted \nto \u201ca legal claim to remedy the breach of a contract implied in law for disclosure of [plaintiffs\u2019] \nconfidential manuscript in exchange for a promise not to disseminate the idea without the \n[plaintiffs\u2019 ] consent\u201d) ; cf. Ki  Beom  Kim  v. Dyna  Flex,  Ltd., 525 F. Supp. 3d 999, 1007- 08 (E.D. \nMo. 2021) (denying a motion to remand, where plaintiff\u2019s unjust enrichment claim raises a \nsubstantial federal question regarding inventorship, as it was not \u201ca dispute stri ctly concerning \nownership, typically involving an underlying contract \u201d but instead  one where \u201cPlaintiff is \nunquestionably arguing that he is the true inventor of the Invention and should have been \nincluded on the patents.  If [Defendant] is the true invent or and owner of the patents, there is no \nreasonable claim that it has been unjustly enriched by continuing to sell products based on the \nPatents\u201d)  (emphasis added) .   8 \n assert that Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim, like its conversion claim , is focused on the \nquestion of inventorship ( and necessarily requires a determination of inventorship in order to \nknow whether a legal violation can be found).  (D.I. 33 at 9- 11; D.I. 46 at 2- 3)  The Court a gain \nagrees  with Defendants.     \nPlaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim begins by i ncorporating the previous allegations of \nPlaintiffs\u2019 inventorship and conversion claims .  (D.I. 19 at \u00b6  63)  It then alleges that  \u201cPlaintiffs \nconferred a benefit on Defendants by providing them valuable intellectual property  about \ncryptocurrency mining systems and related confidential information and materials\u201d and that \n\u201cDefendants have been and continue to be unjustly enriched by pr ofiting from their wrongful \nconduct [,] [i]n particular, Defendants have unlawfully used Plaintiffs\u2019 property by asserting \ninventorship over the BearBox Technology, and deriving an unjust benefit from exploiting Storms\u2019 cryptocurrency mining inventions.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 64, 67 (emphasis added) )  As for \ndamages, Plaintiffs allege a \u201closs of money and proper ty as a result of Defendants\u2019 wrongful use \nof Plaintiffs\u2019 intellectual property, including the right to any patent based on their own intellectual property.\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6  68 (emphasis added) )  Thus, in light of the way Plaintiffs have \npleaded the claim , the claim\u2019s gravamen is t hat Defendants have been enriched because they \nhave declared that they are the inventors of th e '433 patent \u2014and that this enrichment is unjust \nbecause Mr. Storms is actually the true inventor.  This claim , as pleaded,  is also  preempted by \nfederal patent law.  See James , 2018 WL 6092461, at *4- 5 (finding that the plaintiff\u2019s unjust \nenrichment claim was preempted because it was \u201cfundamentally based on plaintiff\u2019s assertion that he should have been named on the '638 patent\u201d); OptoLum, Inc.  v. Cree,  Inc., 244 F. Supp. \n3d 1005, 1014 (D. Ariz. 2017) (\u201cBecause OptoLum \u2019s unjust enrichment claim depends on the 9 \n determination that OptoLum, not Cree, invented the LED technology at issue here, the claim is \npreempted by federal patent law.\u201d).   \nHere again, because the Court finds that this claim is preempted, it declines to evaluate \nDefendants\u2019 remaining argument s for dismissal .   \nC. Negligent Misrepresentation (Count V) \nThe Court turns lastly to Plaintiffs\u2019 negligent misrepresentation claim in Count V .  Under \nLouisiana law, the tort of negligent misrepresentation has three elements:  (1) there must be a \nlegal duty on the part of the defendant to supply correct information to the plaintiff ; (2) there \nmust be a breach of that duty; and (3) the breach must have caused damages to the plaintiff.  Schaumburg v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 421 F. App\u2019x 434, 439- 40 (5th Cir. 2011) ; Cook \nv. Am. Gateway Bank , 49 So. 3d 23, 32 (La. Ct. App. 2010) .   \nDefendants  first assert that  Count V  is preempted because it is \u201cdependent upon \n[Plaintiffs\u2019] assertion that [Mr.] Storms is an inventor of the '433 patent [.]\u201d  (D.I. 33 at 11- 12; see \nalso D.I. 46 at 2- 3)  In the Court\u2019s view, however, the argument for preemption here is not as \nstrong as it was regarding Counts III and IV.     \nWhile Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion and unjust enrichment claims clearly turn ed on whether Mr. \nStorms is a proper inve ntor of the  '433 patent, the premise of Plaintiffs\u2019  negligent \nmisrepresentation claim  is a bit different.  In Count V, Plaintiffs first allege that Mr. Storms \u201ctold \n[Mr.] McNamara that the cryptocurrency mining systems and related methods were proprietary to Plaintiffs and not to be used or shared outside of Lancium\u201d and that \u201c[Mr.] McNamara gave his word that he w ould abide by this confidentiality.\u201d  (D.I. 19 at \u00b6 71)  The claim then asserts \nthat Plaintiffs relied on Mr. McNamara\u2019s assurances that he would \u201ckeep the BearBox Technology confidential \u201d and that Plaintiffs would not have continued to share information with 10 \n Mr. McNamara had they known that Defendants would violate that promise and  incorporate the \nBearBox Technology into patent applicat ions.   (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 71- 72)  As for damages suffered as a \nresult of Defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentation, Plaintiffs allege  the loss of potential patent \nrights as well as the \u201c costs of Plaintiffs\u2019 know -how converted under the guise of a potential \nbusiness relationship.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 73 (emphasis added) )   \nThus, here the claim as pleaded seems to turn in significant part on whether Mr. \nMcNamara made a representation about confidentiality to Plaintiffs and whether that \nrepresentation  was false;  in resolving those questions , whether Mr. Storms was a true inventor is \nnot necessarily a relevant consideration.  And Plaintiffs\u2019 request for relief is directed,  at least in \npart, to damages for something other than the loss of the ability to license the patent at issue.  In \nlight of this, and in light of the lack of caselaw finding negligent misrepresentation claims to be \npreempted by federal patent law,10 the Co urt concludes that Pl aintiffs\u2019 negligent \nmisrepresentation claim  is not preempted .  Cf.  HIF Bio, Inc. v. Yung Shin Pharms. Indus. Co., \n600 F.3d 1347, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (finding that plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action for , inter alia , \nfraud and intentional and negligent interference with contractual relations claims were not preempted , where the inventorship issue was not essential to the resolution of such claims).   \nHowever, the Court agrees with Defendants that Count V should nevertheless be \ndismissed.  In this regard, Defendants rightly contend that th e claim is fatally flawed because \nPlaintiffs fail to plead a legal duty on the part of Lancium /Mr. McNa mara .  (D.I. 33 at 18- 20; \nD.I. 46 at 10)   \n \n10  Indeed, Defendants acknowledge that they are not aware of any case that \nspecifically addresses preemption of a claim for negligent misrepresentation by federal patent \nlaw.  (D.I. 33 at 13 & n.2)    11 \n Whether these Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiffs is a question of law.  Barrie v. V.P. \nExterminators, Inc., 625 So. 2d 1007, 1015 (La. 1993).  \u201c[ T]he initial inquiry is whether, as a \nmatter of law, a duty is owed to this particular plaintiff to protect him from this particular \nharm [,]\u201d and \u201c[a] negative answer . . . results in a determination of no liability.\u201d  Miller v. Lowe , \nCivil Action No. 08- 1624, 2009 WL 4730201, at *4 (W.D. La. Dec. 4, 2009)  (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted) .   \nPlaintiffs, for their part, argue that the Amended Complaint sufficiently pleads \u201cthe \nexistence of a duty stemming from the confidential relationship established between the parties.\u201d  \n(D.I. 42 at 15)  In this regard , the Supreme Court of Louisiana has explained that  a confidential \nor fiduciary relationship giving rise to the requisite duty can  exist between \u201cgenerally all persons \nwho are associated by any relation of trust and confidence\u201d such as, for example, \u201ctrustee and beneficiary, attorney and client, parent and child, or husband and wife . . . [and] partners and co -\npartners, principal and agent, master and servant, physician and patient[.]\u201d  Bunge Corp. v. \nGATX Corp. , 557 So. 2d 1376, 1384 n.4 (La. 1990).   \nNone of these types of relationships (or something close to them) are at issue here.  \nInstead, the Amended Complaint pleads that Mr. S torms and Mr. McNamara were simply two \nmen with no previous relationship who met each other at a conference, had dinner and went on to discuss a \u201cpotential business relationship\u201d \u2014and that in those conversations , Mr. Storms shared \nwhat he considered to be c onfidential information with Mr. McNamara .  (D.I. 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 72- 73)  \nPlaintiffs cite  to no cases suggesting that this  type of  \u201cbusiness  relationship\u201d gives rise to the \nrequisite duty under Louisiana law.  And c ourts applying Louisiana law to circumstance s \ninvolving similar types of business relationships have found the opposite.  See, e.g., House of \nRaeford Farms of La. LLC v. Poole , CIVIL ACTION NO. 19 -271, 2021 WL 1081837, at * 4-6 12 \n (W.D. La. Mar. 18, 2021) (dismissing a fraudulent misrepresentation claim , which similarly \nrequires th at a special relationship exist between a plaintiff and defendant  establishing a duty to \ndisclose omitted information , where the parties were in a seller -buyer relationship, since \nfiduciary duties do not arise from \u201cordinary supplier -customer contracts\u201d ) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted) ; S. Serv. Corp. v. Tidy Bldg. Servs., Inc., No. Civ.A. 04- 1362, 2004 \nWL 2784909, at *6 (E.D. La. Dec. 1, 2004) (finding that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint failed to state a \nclaim for negligent misrepresentation , where \u201c[t]he relationships between Tidy and its customers \nand Tidy and [plaintiff] do not fall within the class of special relationships of trust and confi dence; they are ordinary commercial relationships\u201d).  Plaintiffs\u2019 negligent misrepresentation \nclaim  therefore  fails as a matter of law.   \nD. Conclusion  \nIn sum, the Court agrees with Defendants that  Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion and unjust \nenrichment claims are p reempted by federal patent law, and that Plaintiffs\u2019 negligent \nmisrepresentation claim is wanting  as a matter of law  due to the fail ure to sufficiently allege the \nrequisite duty.  Plaintiffs have requested leave to amend the  Amended Complaint i f Defendants\u2019 \nMotion is granted.  (D.I. 42 at 18)   The Court believes that this request should be granted  as to \nCounts III and IV because:  (1) it is not clear that allowing the opportunity to  amend would be a \nfutile act ;\n11 (2) this is the first time the Court has found Plaintiffs\u2019 claims to be deficiently \npleaded ; and (3) leave to amend should be given freely \u201cwhen justice so requires .\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 15(a)(2) .  As to Count V, however, the C ourt does not see how Plaintiff s can plead a plausible \n \n11  If Plaintiffs are given the opportunity to replead, they should be mindful of \nDefendants \u2019 other arguments for dismissal of these Counts, (D.I. 33 at 14- 18), and should \naddress those arguments in the new pleading to the extent they need to, as it is not likely that \nPlaintiff s would be given a further chance to replead thereafter.  13 \n claim (i.e. how Plaintiff s can possibly allege the requisite duty).  Thus, the Court also \nrecommends that dismissal of Counts III and IV be without prejudice and that dismissal of Count \nV be with prejudice.  The Court suggests that, to the extent the District Court affirms the Court\u2019s recommendation, Plaintiffs be given leave to file  one further amended complaint within 14 days.  \nTriDiNetworks Ltd. v.
