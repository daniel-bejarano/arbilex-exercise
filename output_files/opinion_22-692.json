Calo, David L. Gordon, \nBUCHANAN INGERSOLL & ROONEY PC, Princeton, New Jersey \nCounsel for Defendants December 20, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION \n11 CHIEF JUDGE \nRobert McRedmond, Sr., (Robert Senior) was a patient in a skilled nursing \nfacility in New Castle County, Delaware just before he passed away from COVID-\n19 in May 2019. That facility was operated by Defendants ProMedica Health \nSystems, Inc., HCR Healthcare, LLC, ProMedica Senior Care Medical Services I, \nLLC, HCR II Healthcare, LLC, HCR III Healthcare, LLC, Manor Care-Pike Creek \nof Wilmington, DE, LLC, and HCR Manor Care Services, LLC (collectively, \nManor Care). Robert Senior's children, Plaintiffs Robert McRedmond, Jr. (Robert \nJunior) and Amber McRedmond, brought this suit for negligence and wrongful \ndeath against Manor Care in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in New \nCastle County. Manor Care removed the case to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1441(a). \nManor Care has now moved to compel arbitration of Plaintiffs' claims under \n9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, et seq., or alternatively to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction and failure to state a claim under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(l) and 12(b)(6). D.I. 15. I have subject matter jurisdiction over this action \nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(l) and 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. I. BACKGROUND1 \nA. Robert Senior's 2018 Admission to the Pike Creek Facility \nIn June 2018, Robert Senior was admitted to a skilled nursing facility \noperated by Manor Care in Pike Creek, Delaware. D.I. 13 ,I,I 4, 61. Pike Creek is \nlocated in New Castle County. Robert Senior was discharged from the Pike Creek \nfacility in July 2018. D.I. 13 ,I 61. In the ensuing months, he spent periods of time \nliving at home with his children, in a hospital, and in another nursing facility. \nD.I. 13 ,I 61. \nB. Robert Senior's 2019 Admission to the Pike Creek Facility \nIn May 2019, after having suffered a stroke, Robert Senior was re-admitted \nto the Pike Creek facility. D.I. 13 ,I 62. Upon his re-admission, Manor Care \npresented Robert Senior and Robert Junior with two standard form contracts: an \n\"Admission Agreement between Patient and Center\" (the 2019 Admission \nAgreement) and a \"Voluntary Arbitration Agreement\" (the 2019 Voluntary \nArbitration Agreement). D.I. 13 ,I 63; D.I. 13-2. \nRobert Junior signed the 2019 Admission Agreement as the \"Responsible \nParty\" for his father, who is identified in the Agreement as \"Patient.\" D.I. 13-2 at \n2. (Under section four of the 2019 Admission Agreement, the \"Responsible \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the following facts are taken from the Amended \nComplaint and the documents referenced in the Amended Complaint. See D.I. 13. \n2 Party's Responsibilities\" include, among other things, \"[p]ay[ing] for all charges \nthat Patient incurs while at the [Pike Creek facility] from the Patient's income or \nresources,\" \"[n]otify[ing] [Manor Care] immediately and in writing if the Patient's \nfinancial resources are depleted,\" and \"[s]ecur[ing] Medicaid in a timely and \nproper manner.\" D.I. 13-2 at 4.) \nUnder the heading \"Other Documents that require your signature,\" the 2019 \nAdmission Agreement lists four documents, one of which is the \"Voluntary \nArbitration Agreement, if elected.\" D.I. 13-2 at 2. Section five of the 2019 \nAdmission Agreement, titled \"Venue Notice,\" provides in relevant part: \nAll claims relating to ... any past, present or future \nadmission of the Patient to the [Pike Creek facility], \nincluding ... any claim relating in any way to the care \nand treatment provided to the Patient, will be brought in \nthe Court of the County and State where the [facility] is \nlocated. . . . If you agree to the Voluntary Arbitration \nAgreement, which is a separate agreement from this \nAgreement, the Voluntary Arbitration Agreement will \ncontrol. If, however, the Voluntary Arbitration \nAgreement is not signed or it is not enforced for any \nreason, this Venue Notice section will control. If you do \nnot agree to this Venue Notice section, please initial here: \nD.I. 13-2 at 4. Neither Robert Senior nor Robert Junior initialed the Venue Notice \nsection. See D.I. 13-2 at 4. \nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the 2019 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement read as \nfollows: \n3 1. Voluntary Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes. The \nparties agree that they will mutually benefit from the \nspeedy and efficient resolution of any dispute or \ncontroversy which may arise between them. This is a \nvoluntary Agreement to have all disputes resolved \nthrough binding arbitration by an independent neutral \nArbitrator who will be selected by the parties as specified \nin this Agreement. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT \nTHEY ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY \nJURY. ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES \nWILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH \nBINDING ARBITRATION. \n2. Parties. This Agreement and the definitions in this \nSection will be interpreted as broadly as possible so as to \nbind and benefit any person who asserts any claim or \nagainst whom a claim is asserted by or on behalf of \n[Manor Care] or the Patient. The parties intend to allow \nany person alleged to be liable for any actions or \ninactions of [Manor Care] or the Patient or related to any \ncare provided to the Patient to demand arbitration \npursuant to this Agreement. \n* * * * \nb. \"Patient\" includes the Patient, the Patient's \nRepresentative, the Patient's guardian, attorney-in-fact, \nagent, sponsor, or any person whose claim is derived \nthrough or on behalf of the Patient, including any spouse, \nchild, parent, executor, administrator, personal \nrepresentative, heir, or survivor, as well as anyone \nentitled to bring a wrongful death claim relating to the \nPatient. The Patient is an intended third-party \nbeneficiary of this Agreement. \nD.I. 13-2 at 15 (capitalization in the original). \nRobert Senior refused to sign the 2019 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement, \nand his refusal \"was noted on the document.\" D.I. 13 ,r 63; D.I. 13-2 at 17 \n4 (handwriting stating \"declined to sign\"). Robert Junior also did not sign the 2019 \nVoluntary Arbitration Agreement. See D.I. 13 ,r 63; D.I. 13-2 at 17. \nC. The Actions That Led to This Suit \nRobert Senior did not leave the Pike Creek facility until shortly before his \ndeath on May 19, 2020. D.I. 13 ,r,r 62, 73. During his approximately year-long \nstay at the Pike Creek facility, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Between the onset \nof COVID-19 and May 12, 2020, Manor Care told Robert Senior's family that he \nhad a room to himself to protect him from COVID-19, when, in reality, he had a \nroommate who died of COVID-19. D.I. 13 ,r 67. During a video chat with Robert \nSenior in May 2020, Robert Junior observed a nurse in Robert Senior's room not \nwearing a mask. D.I. 13 ,r 69. When Robert Junior questioned the nurse about her \nnot wearing a mask, she said the call was \"breaking up\" and, at that point, the call \ndisconnected. D .I. 13 ,r 69. When the call resumed, the nurse was wearing a mask. \nD.I. 13 ,r 69. \nRobert Senior's daily progress notes indicate that he had a cough and \nshortness of breath on May 8, 2020 and that he was in respiratory isolation on May \n9 but not in respiratory isolation on May 10. D.I. 13 ,r,r 70-71. It appears from the \nprogress notes that Manor Care did not check Robert Senior's vital signs from May \n7 through May 12. D.I. 13 ,r 72. On May 12, Robert Senior was noted to have had \ndifficulty breathing, swollen lower extremities, and a pale complexion; and \"[a] \n5 decision was made to send him to [ a hospital's emergency room] for evaluation.\" \nD.I. 13 ,I 73. At some point (the Amended Complaint does not give a date), Robert \nSenior was transported to Christiana Hospital, where he tested positive for \nCOVID-19 and was intubated. D.I. 13 ,I 73. Robert Senior died on May 19, 2020 \n\"due to COVID-19.\" D.I. 13 ,I 73. \nII. PROCEDURAL POSTURE AND ISSUES BEFORE ME \nOn April 14, 2022, Plaintiffs sued Manor Care in the Superior Court of the \nState of Delaware in New Castle County, Delaware. D.I. 1-1 at 6. The Superior \nCourt is the trial court of general jurisdiction in Delaware, and thus the Delaware \nstate court where negligence and wrongful death claims are tried. See DEL. CONST. \nart. IV,\u00a7 7; 10 Del. C. \u00a7 542. Notwithstanding the fact that the 2019 Admission \nAgreement explicitly states that \"[a]ll claims relating to ... any past, present or \nfuture admission of the Patient to the [Pike Creek facility], including ... any claim \nrelating in any way to the care and treatment provided to the Patient, will be \nbrought in the Court of the County and State where the [facility] is located,\" \nD.I. 13-2 at 4 (emphasis added), Manor Care removed the case to this Court, \nthereby depriving Plaintiffs of the venue the parties had contractually agreed to. \nD.I. 1. \nCompounding this deprivation and causing further delay and attorney fees \nfor Plaintiffs to litigate this motion, Manor Care has moved to compel arbitration \n6 of Plaintiffs' claims. Now, given the express language of the 2019 Admission \nAgreement and the undisputed fact that neither Robert Senior nor Robert Junior \nsigned the Voluntary Arbitration Agreement presented to them by Manor Care in \n2019, you might be thinking, how could that be? Well, it turns out that when \nRobert Senior was admitted to the Pike Creek facility in June 2018, he signed the \nexact same standard form Voluntary Arbitration Agreement he and his son refused \nto sign in 2019. And Manor Care argues that because the language of that standard \nform agreement covers \"any dispute or controversy\" between the parties-with no \nlimitations on the timing or nature of the dispute or controversy-I have no choice \nbut to send Plaintiffs' case to arbitration. D .I. 16 at 7-9. Manor Care also takes \nthe position that I lack the power to question its assertion that the 2018 Voluntary \nArbitration Agreement covers this dispute because the language of the agreement \ndelegates all questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. D.I. 16 at 9-10. \nIII. ANALYSIS \nWhether Plaintiffs' claims are subject to arbitration turns on whether the \n2019 Admission Agreement and 2019 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement \nsuperseded the 2018 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement. But the first question \nbefore me is who makes that determination-the Court or the arbitrator? The \nThird Circuit recently answered this threshold question in Field Intelligence Inc v. \nXylem Dewatering Solutions Inc, 49 F.4th 351 (3d Cir. 2022). \n7 Like the parties here, the parties in Field Intelligence signed two contracts; \nand, like here, the earlier contract required arbitration, but the later contract did \nnot. Id. at 353. Field Intelligence sued Xylem in federal court for breach of the \nlater contract. Xylem responded by filing a demand for arbitration based on the \nearlier contract and moving to stay the federal lawsuit. Field Intelligence opposed \nXylem's motion and cross-moved to enjoin the arbitration. The district court \ngranted Field Intelligence's request to enjoin the arbitration and denied the motion \nto stay as moot. Xylem appealed that ruling. \nOn appeal, the Third Circuit recognized at the outset of its analysis that \nparties \"may ... agree to delegate to an arbitrator 'gateway' questions of \n'arbitrability,' such as whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their \nagreement covers a particular controversy.\" Id. at 355 (quoting Henry Schein, Inc. \nv. Archer & White Sales, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 524, 529 (2019)) (some internal quotation \nmarks omitted). It then stated that the appeal before it involved the \"threshold \nquestion\" of \"whether Field Intelligence is bound by the arbitration provision in \nthe parties' 2013 contract, or whether the 2017 agreement superseded that contract \ncompletely, thereby eliminating [Field Intelligence's] duty to arbitrate.\" Id. at \n355-56. The Court continued: \nTwo issues stem from this gateway concern. First, who \nshould decide whether the second contract replaced the \nfirst, a court or an arbitrator? Second, if a court, rather \nthan an arbitrator, should decide, does the parties' \n8 Id. at 356. [ second] contract in fact supersede their earlier \nagreement? \nWith respect to the first issue-the same initial issue before me here-the \nCourt held that \"the parties' supersession dispute is for a court, not an arbitrator, to \ndecide.\" Id. The Court explained: \nTh[is] conclusion flows necessarily from a first principle \nof arbitration law: that \"arbitration is strictly a matter of \nconsent.\" An arbitrator's authority is limited to those \nclaims that \"the parties have agreed to submit to \narbitration.\" So before sending parties to an arbitrator, a \ncourt must decide whether they agreed to resolve their \ndispute in that forum, which in tum requires it to \ndetermine \"whether an arbitration agreement exists at \nall[.]\" Because the substance of the parties' supersession \ndispute is \"whether there is an agreement to arbitrate,\" \nthe District Court rightly declined to send it to an \narbitrator. \nXylem asks us to view this case differently. It points to \nthe general rule, referenced above, that parties may \ndelegate threshold arbitrability issues to an arbitrator \nprovided there is \"clear and unmistakable\" evidence they \nagreed to do so. The 2013 contract's arbitration \nprovision, it says, contains such clear and unmistakable \nevidence, as it expressly delegates arguments over its \n\"termination or invalidity\" to an arbitrator. Hence that \nperson, not a court, must decide the supersession dispute. \nWere this fight simply about whether the 2013 agreement \nhad terminated or was invalid, we might agree. But the \nquestion here is whether, by the later contract, the parties \nintended to extinguish their prior agreement and litigate \nany disputes between them moving forward. Put another \nway, if Field Intelligence is correct that the 2017 contract \n9 superseded the 2013 agreement, then there is no \narbitration agreement for us to enforce. And \"it can \nhardly be said that contracting parties clearly and \nunmistakably agreed to have an arbitrator decide the \nexistence of an arbitration agreement when one of the \nparties has put the existence of that very agreement in \ndispute.\" \nId. at 356 (internal citations omitted). \nAccordingly, I tum to the question of whether the 2019 Admission \nAgreement and 2019 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement supersede the 2018 \nVoluntary Arbitration Agreement. The answer to that question is clear-yes. \nThe parties agree that Delaware law governs the interpretation of the \nagreements. See D.I. 16 at 8-9; D.I. 25 at 7; D.I. 26 at 4. \"Delaware recognizes \nthat where a new, later contract between the parties covers the same subject matter \nas an earlier contract, the new contract supersedes and controls that issue, if the \ntwo agreements conflict.\" Cabe/a 's LLC v. Wellman, 2018 WL 5309954, at *4 \n(Del. Ch. Oct. 26, 2018); see also Country Life Homes, Inc. v. Shaffer, 2007 WL \n333075, at *5 (Del. Ch. Jan. 31, 2007) (\"The new contract, as a general matter, will \ncontrol over the old contract with respect to the same subject matter to the extent \nthat the new contract is inconsistent with the old contract or if the parties expressly \nagreed that the new contract would supersede the old one.\"). \nHere, the parties' new contract, set forth in the combination of the 2019 \nAdmission Agreement and the 2019 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement, covers the \n10 same subject matter as the first contract, set forth in the 2018 Voluntary Arbitration \nAgreement (Manor Care did not submit a copy of a 2018 Admission Agreement \nfor Robert Senior); and the two contracts are in conflict. Accordingly, the later \ncontract controls. \nBoth Robert Senior and Robert Junior refused to sign the 2019 Voluntary \nArbitration Agreement, and someone wrote on that agreement \"declined to sign.\" \nD.I. 13 ,r 63. Moreover, none of the parties to the contract initialed section five of \nthe 2019 Admission Agreement to express disagreement with that section's \nprovision that \"[a]ll claims relating to ... any past, present or future admission of \n[Robert Senior] to the [Pike Creek facility], including ... any claim relating in any \nway to the care and treatment provided to [Robert Senior], will be brought in the\" \nDelaware Superior Court in New Castle County. D.I. 13-2 at 4 (emphasis added). \nThus, by signing the 2019 Admission Agreement and not initialing section five, \nboth Manor Care and Robert Junior made clear that the parties intended to litigate \nall their disputes in the Delaware Superior Court, not in an arbitration proceeding. \nThe 2019 Admission Agreement and 2019 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement \ntherefore supersede the 2018 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement. \nFinally, at oral argument, Manor Care suggested for the first time that the \n2019 Admission Agreement and 2019 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement could not \nsupersede the 2018 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement because Robert Senior \n11 signed the 2018 Voluntary Arbitration Agreement whereas Robert Junior signed \nthe 2019 Admission Agreement on his father's behalf. Manor Care forfeited its \nright to raise this issue because it did not argue it squarely in its briefing. See John \nWyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Intern. Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. \n1997); Anspach ex rel. Anspach v. City of Phi/a., Dep't of Pub. Health, 503 F.3d \n256, 258 n. l (3d Cir. 2007). But in any event, the argument fails on the merits \nbecause both Voluntary Arbitration Agreements say that they are agreements \n\"between\" Manor Care, \"the Patient,\" \"and\" \"the Patient's Representative\"; both \nagreements require the definition of \"parties\" to \"be interpreted as broadly as \npossible so as to bind and benefit any person who asserts any claim or against \nwhom a claim is asserted by or on behalf of [Manor Care] or the Patient\"; and both \nagreements define \"Patient\" to include \"the Patient's Representative, the Patient's \nguardian, attorney-in-fact, agent, sponsor, or any person whose claim is derived \nthrough or on behalf of the Patient, including any ... child, ... personal \nrepresentative, heir, or survivor, as well as anyone entitled to bring a wrongful \ndeath claim relating to the Patient.\" D.I. 13-2 at 15; D.I. 16-1 at 2. Indeed, Manor \nCare argued in its Reply Brief that Robert Junior is a party to the 2018 Voluntary \nArbitration Agreement. See D .I. 26 at 5-6 (\"The terms of the 2018 [Voluntary \nArbitration] Agreement unambiguously apply to wrongful death claims, and define \nthe parties as including wrongful death beneficiaries.\"). \n12 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, I will deny Manor Care's motion to compel \narbitration. \nI will not address Manor Care's alternative arguments to dismiss the case \nbecause I expect that Manor Care will take an appeal from the denial of its motion \nto compel arbitration of Plaintiffs' claims. (Manor Care refused at oral argument \nto answer whether it would appeal a denial of the motion to compel, but its \nlitigation conduct to this date strongly suggests that an appeal is coming.) Any \nsuch appeal would automatically divest this Court of jurisdiction, see Ehleiter v. \nGrapetree Shores, Inc., 482 F.3d 207,215 n.6 (3d Cir. 2007) (adopting \"the \nmajority rule of automatic divestiture where the [ arbitrability] appeal is neither \nfrivolous nor forfeited\"), and thus would further delay Plaintiffs' ability to litigate \ntheir claims on the merits in front of a jury. I am intent on doing what I can to \nstreamline the appeals process, and I will therefore not give Manor Care legal \nrulings it might use to burden unnecessarily the Third Circuit and Plaintiffs. \nAccordingly, I will deny Manor Care's alternative motion to dismiss without \nprejudice to refile. \n13 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAMBER MCREDMOND, \nindividually and as the \nAdministratrix of the Estate of \nROBERT MCREDMOND, SR., \nand ROBERT MCREDMOND, JR., \nindividually, \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nHCR HEALTHCARE, LLC, HCR \nII HEALTHCARE, LLC, HCR III \nHEALTHCARE,LLC,HCR \nMANOR CARE SERVICES, LLC, \nMANOR CARE-PIKE CREEK OF \nWILMINGTON, DE, LLC, \nPROMEDICA HEAL TH SYSTEM, \nINC., and PROMEDICA SENIOR \nCARE MEDICAL SERVICES I, \nLLC, \nDefendants.
