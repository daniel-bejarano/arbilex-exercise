{"case_name": "Sommer v. Southwest Energy Company, et al.", "case_number": "21-1153", "judge": "Judge Stephanos Bibas", "date": "03-28-2023", "ocr_text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nNATHANIEL SOMMER  \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nSOUTHWESTERN ENERGY \nCOMPANY, et al.  \n \nDefendant s. \n No. 1:21-cv-1153-SB \n \n \nBlake A. Bennett, COOCH AND TAYLOR , Wilmington, Delaware . \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff . \n \nEdward Bennett Micheletti, SKADDEN , ARPS, SLATE , MEAGHER & FLOM  LLP, \nWilmington, Delaware . \n \nCounsel for Defendant s. \n \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \n \nJuly 12, 2022   2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nLitigants typically pay their  own attorneys\u2019 fees. But there are exceptions . For \ninstance, when a plaintiff wins some benefit for a broader class  of people , he may \ncharge his  legal bills to his opponent.  \nNathaniel Sommer claims that this case fits that exception . He says his lawsuit \nprompted Southwestern Energy to disclose additional information about a proposed \nmerger , benefiting shareholders who could use that information . Maybe. But because \nSommer  would not have won , he cannot recover attorneys\u2019  fees.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nSouthwestern Energy, a natural -gas producer, planned to buy another gas com-\npany, Indigo Natural Resources. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  23\u201325. As part of the deal , it filed \na proxy statement  with the SEC. Id. \u00b6 26. That  document was supposed to giv e South-\nwestern\u2019s  shareholders the scoop so they could  decide whether to approve the pur-\nchase .  \nBut the statement did not include as much detail as some shareholders wanted . \nThough it predicted Southwestern\u2019s financial outlook after the purchase , it did not  \nprovide every piece of data  \u201cused to calculate [those] projections.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31 \u201334. \nSo one of Southwestern\u2019s shareholders, Nathaniel Sommer, sued. He said the com-\npany\u2019s proxy statement violated the Securities and Exchange Act by omitting \u201cmate-\nrial fact[s].\u201d Id. \u00b6 39. Plus, by omitting these key facts, Southwestern\u2019s directors sup-\nposedly breached  their fiduciary duty to disclose. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 55\u201359. 3 Days after Sommer sued, South western added more  information to the proxy \nstatement. D.I. 18, at 2. Th e deal went through, so  Sommer voluntarily dismissed the \ncase. Id.; D.I. 15. Now Sommer seeks attorneys\u2019 fees  for his efforts . D.I. 16.  \nII. SOMMER IS NOT ENTITLED TO ATTORNEYS \u2019 FEES \nFirst  off, the parties contest  whether federal or Delaware law govern s their  fee \ndispute . D.I. 22, at 6 \u20137; D.I. 23, at 1. The answer is both: For federal questions, like \nthose in Sommer\u2019s Exchange Act claim, federal law determines whether attorneys\u2019 \nfees are due. Klein v. City of Laguna Beach , 810 F.3d 693, 701 \u201302 (9th Cir. 2016); \nRodriguez v. Quicken Loans, Inc. , 257 F. Supp. 3d 840, 844 \u201345 (S.D. Tex. 2017). For \nstate -law issues, like Sommer\u2019s  fiduciary -duty claim, Delaware rules apply. McAdam \nv. Dean Witter Re ynolds, Inc. , 896 F.2d 750, 775 n.47 (3d Cir. 1990).  \nIn any case, this distinction does not matter  here because federal and Delaware \nrules work the same way . Both let plaintiffs recover when their litigation \u201cconfer[red] \na common benefit upon a class  \u2026 not  participating in the litigation.\u201d Polonski v. \nTrump Taj Mahal Assoc s., 137 F.3d 139, 145 (3d Cir. 1998); see also United Vanguard \nFund, Inc. v. TakeCare, Inc. , 727 A.2d 844, 850 (Del. Ch. 1998 ). And when, as here, \nthe claims were mooted, both rules require a plaintiff to show the original suit was \n\u201cmeritorious \u201d\u2014that is, whether it \u201ccould have survived a motion to dismiss .\u201d Kahan \nv. Rosenstiel , 424 F.2d 161, 167 (3d Cir. 1970); United Vanguard , 727  A.2d at 850.   \nNeither of Sommer\u2019s claims would  have  survived . The plausibility of Sommer\u2019s  \nExchange Act and breach -of-fiduciary -duty claims turn on the same question: did he \nallege that Southwestern\u2019s proxy omitted something  \u201cmaterial\u201d? Bell Atl. Corp. v.  \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007) ; TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc. , 426 U.S. 438, 4 449 (1976); Pfeffer v. Redstone , 965 A.2d 676, 685 (Del. 2009). An omission is material \nif it would have \u201csignificantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information \u2026 available \u201d to \nshareholders.  Northway , 426 U.S. at 449; Abrons v. Maree , 911 A.2d 805, 813 (Del. \nCh. 2006) (\u201cDelaware mirrors federal law on materiality.\u201d). Though Sommer alleged \nsome omissions, none was material.  \nSommer  claimed that the proxy statement did not fully explain how it calcu lated \nSouthwestern\u2019s future income. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  31\u201334; see D.I. 22 -2, exh. C., at 477\u201379. For \nexample, the proxy calculated Southwestern\u2019s future income using \u201cdiscount rates\u201d of \n6.5\u20138% (rates calculating how much income earned in the future would be worth to-\nday). Id. at 478. It explained that it picked those rates by looking at Southwestern\u2019s \nprojected \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201clong -term debt.\u201d Id. But it did not list every \u201cassumption [] \nunderlying\u201d the growth rate or give the precise amount of Southwestern\u2019s debt. \nCompl. \u00b6  33. Sommer zeroed in on that missing detail . Without it, he said, the proxy \nwas \u201cmi sleadingly incomplete.\u201d Id. \u00b6 35. \nBut a proxy statement need not list every variable. See Serion v. Nuance Commc\u2019s, \nInc., 2022 WL 356695, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2022); Scott v. DST Sys., Inc. , 2019 WL \n3997097, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 23, 2019) (noting that , to win,  shareholders must \u201cexplain \nhow [they] would [be] misled\u201d without the missing variables). Nor must it enable \nstockholders \u201cto make their own independent [calculations].\u201d In re 3Com Sharehold-\ners Litig. , 2009 WL 5173804, at *2 (Del. Ch. Dec. 18, 2009).  Instead, it need only give \ninvestors a \u201cfair summary\u201d of the factors underlying its calculations. Serion , 2022 WL \n356695, at *2  (internal quotation marks omitted) . 5 Here, the proxy did enough. It included  a \u201cfair  summary \u201d of Southwestern\u2019s \ngrowth rate, explain ing the mix of elements behind those  calculations . See D.I. 22 -2, \nexh. C., at 478. And telling shareholders that calculations included debt , without re-\nvealing  the precise amount, is also  a fair overview . Besides, Sommer\u2019s complaint did \nnot explain how more  detail would have changed the game. So he allege d no material \nomission  and failed to state  a plausible claim . He thus cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees.  \nPushing back, Sommer points out that Delaware law sometimes allows recovery \nwhen a suit forces a disclosure  of information  that is \u201chelpful\u201d but not \u201cmaterial.\u201d D.I. \n23, at 1 (quoting In re Xoom Corp. Stockholder Litig. , 2016 WL 4146425, at *3 (Del. \nCh. Aug. 4, 2016)). That rule, he says, lets him recover fees for litigating his state -\nlaw fiduciary -duty claim. Id.  \nBut this relaxed  standard applies to a different  requirement for getting fees under \nDelaware law: whether a defendant\u2019s supplemental disclosures \u201cbenefit[ed] \u2026 the \ncorporation.\u201d  In re Xoom , 2016 WL 4146425, at *3 & n.15 (quoting the two -part test \nand noting the \u201cdifferent analysis\u201d at step two,  which is  \u201cwhether [the] disclosures \nadded value\u201d) ; see also In re Trulia, Inc. S'holder Litig. , 129 A.3d 884, 898 (Del. Ch. \n2016) . And I need not reach that step unless  Sommer\u2019s underlying claim was plausi-\nble. Cf. United Vanguard, 727 A.2d at 850; In re Xoom , 2016  WL 4146425, at *3  n.15. \nAs I have explained, it was not.  \nAnd even if it was, Southwestern\u2019s extra disclosure s were not \u201chelpful .\u201d Though  \n\u201c\u2018[h]elpful\u2019 is a lower bar than \u2018material, \u2019\u201da helpful disclosure must still \u201caid a rea-\nsonable shareholder in deciding whether to vote\u201d on the transaction . City Trading 6 Fund v. Nye , 72 N.Y.S.3d 371, 382 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2018) (discussing In re Xoom ). None \nof the new disclosures meet that bar.  \nSome of the language was not news to sharehol ders\u2014and Sommer does not try to \nclaim it was . See D.I. 18, at 5 \u20137; D.I. 22, at 9.  For instance , the proxy added language \nthat the calculations were \u201c[b]ased on [the financial advisor\u2019s] professional judgment \nand experie nce\u201d and repeated the name of the pricing model used to calculate dis-\ncount rates  See, e.g. , D.I. 22 -2, exh. D, at 685. Yet the shareholders knew these things \nalready: the financial advisor repeated that disclaimer throughout the first proxy , the \nmodel was already disclosed in the same sentence s. See, e.g. , D.I. 22 -2, exh. C, at 477 \u2013\n80.  \nAnother disclosure was irrelevant to the purchase and thus unhelpful to share-\nholders . The first proxy said that Southwestern could grant the financial advisor a \ndiscretionar y bonus. D.I. 22 -2, exh. C, at 387 . The supplement clarified that South-\nwestern had not decided whether it would. D .I. 22 -2, exh. D, at 688. That does not \nchange much; no reasonable shareholder would rely on that statement to vote for (or \nagainst) the purchase .  \nSommer focuses on a final disclosure. The proxy statement included a table valu-\ning the deal by comparing it to other deals in the prev ious two years. D.I. 22 -2, exh. \nC, at 478. The supplement added one column to that table, indicating how much the \nbuying  company had paid for the purchase . D.I. 22 -2, exh. D, at 687. But that was \npublic information. See, e.g. , EQT Announces Transformative Transaction with Alta \nResources , EQT (May 6, 2021 ), https://perma.cc/W2V8 -E6QF ; Parsley Energy 7 Announces Acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy in All -Stock Transaction; Modest Pre-\nmium Acquisition Enhances 2020F , Bloomberg Business (Oct. 14, 2019, 8:29 A.M), \nhttps://perma.cc/2MC4 -9B58 . Simply stating public information does not help share-\nholders. Cf. Klein v. Gen. Nutrition Cos. , 186 F.3d 338, 343 (3d Cir. 1999).  \nBesides, the first version of the table already included a column telling sharehold-\ners how similar sales  compared. See D.I. 22 -2, exh. B, at 133 (listing ratios for each \ndeal, comparing the price paid for a company to its cash flow the year after its pur-\nchase). So disclosures about the actual purchase  price did not add any helpful detail.  \n* * * * * \nBeca use Sommer\u2019s complaint was not meritorious  and resulting disclosures were \nunhelpful , I deny his motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.
