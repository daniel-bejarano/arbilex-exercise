No. 19-2066 (MN)  \n CONSOLIDATED  \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington, this  8th day of August 2022; \nPlaintiff and Counter -Defendant Apex Clearing Corporation (\u201cApex\u201d) and Defendants and \nCounterclaimants Axos Financial Inc. and Axos Clearing LLC (collectively \u201cAxos\u201d) have been \nembroiled in a trademark dispute for more than two years.  The present motions \u2013 Axos\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (D.I 157) and Apex\u2019s Motion For Leave To File Second Amended Complaint  \n(D.I 162) \u2013 do not concern the merits of the parties\u2019 substantive claims.\n1  Rather, Axos challenges \nApex\u2019s standing to bring its claim s and Apex seeks the Court\u2019s leave to amend and supplement its \ncomplaint by adding another party, Apex Fintech Solutions, LLC (\u201cFintech\u201d),  as its co -plaintiff.   \nThe parties\u2019 motions are related.  It is not disputed that Fintech is the owner of the \ntrademark (\u201cMark\u201d) that Apex Clearing Corporation asserts is infringed.  (D.I. 161 \u00b6 3, D.I. 163 at 3).  Apex owned the Mark when it filed its initial and amended complaint, but assigned its registration  to Fintech on May 3, 2021 \u2013 roughly eleven months after the Scheduling Order\u2019s \n \n1  The curious reader will find a recounting of the parties\u2019 claims in the Court\u2019s opinion \ndenying the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment.  See D.I. 144. 2 deadline to amend pleadings (D.I. 15 \u00b6 2) and a little over two months after the end of fact \ndiscovery.  (D.I. 42).  Shortly before the pretrial conference, Axos discovered that Apex did not own the Mark and asserted that Apex no longer has standing to raise its claims.  ( See D.I. 151 \n\u00b6\u00b6 49, 50; Ex. 3 \u00b6 2; Ex. 7 \u00b6 17; Ex. 8 \u00b6 2; Ex. 17 \u00b6 9).  The Court postponed trial to permit the parties to address Apex\u2019s standing, and Axos then filed its motion to dismiss for lack of standing. \nApex opposes Axos\u2019s motion and asserts that it currently has standing to bring all but one \nof its asserted claims.\n2  But to put the question of standing to rest, Apex moves for leave to amend \nand supplement its complaint to add Fintech as a party.  Its proposed amended and supplement al \nComplaint is substantively identical to the presently operative pleading, as all the proposed \npleading does is add Fintech as a party.  ( See D.I. 162, Ex. B).  Apex\u2019s amendments do not add a \nlegal theory or alter the remedy sought in any way.  ( See D.I. 163 at 4).  Axos opposes Apex\u2019s \nmotion, pointing out that the Scheduling Order\u2019s deadline to amend the complaint has long since passed and contending that Apex cannot satisf y the criteria to amend and supplement its complaint \nat this stage of litigation.  \nI. Apex\u2019s Motion for Leave to Amend and Supplement its Complaint  \nApex\u2019s motion for leave to amend and supplement its Complaint comes after the \nScheduling Order\u2019s deadline to do so has passed.  Accordingly, the Court will grant Apex\u2019s motion only if it satisfies the standards of both Rule 16(b)(4) and Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  See Componentone, L.L.C. v. Componentart, Inc., 2007 WL 2580635, at *2 (W.D .Pa. \nAug.16, 2007) (explaining that \u201conce the pretrial scheduling order \u2019s deadline for filing motions to \n \n2  Apex does not contend that it has standing to bring the \u00a7 1141(1) claim, but has provided \nexamples of courts permitting similarly situated plaintiffs to bring such a claim.  (D.I. 163 \nat 10 n.2 (citing Calvin Klein Jeanswear Co. v. Tunnel Trading, No. 98-Civ.- 5408, 2001 \nWL 1456577, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2001) ). 3 amend the pleadings has passed, a party must, under Rule 16(b), demonstrate \u2018good cause\u2019 for its \nfailure to comply with the scheduling order before the  trial court can consider, under Rule 15(a), \nthe party \u2019s motion to amend its pleading.\u201d).  Rule 16(b)(4) states that \u201c[a] schedule may be \nmodified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d  \u201cGood cause exists when the [s]chedule cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.\u201d  ICU Medical, Inc. v. RyMed Techs., Inc. , 674 F. Supp. 2d 574, 577 (D . Del. 2009) (internal quotations \nmarks omitted).  See also Chancellor v. Pottsgrove School Dist., 501 F. Supp. 3d 695, 701 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (\u201cGood cause under Rule 16(b) focuses on the diligence of the party seeking the modification of the scheduling order.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Rule 15(d) provides that \u201c[o] n motion and reasonable notice, the court may, on j ust terms, permit a party to serve a \nsupplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.  The court may permit supplementation even though the \noriginal pleading is defecti ve in stating a claim or defense. \u201d  Under this Rule, \u201cabsent undue or \nsubstantial prejudice, an amendment should be allowed . . . unless denial can be grounded in bad \nfaith or dilatory motive, truly undue or unexplained delay, repeated failure to cure defi ciency by \namendments previously allowed or futility of amendment.\u201d\n3  Long v. Wilson, 393 F.3d 390, 400 \n(3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).    With respect to Rule 16(b)(4)\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d standard, Apex contends that it was \nsufficiently diligent for two reasons.  First, Apex believes that because the Scheduling Order\u2019s deadline for amendments passed well before it assigned its Mark to Fintech, it could not possibly \n \n3  The Rule 15(d) standard is the same as the Rule 15(a) standard.  See Masimo Corp. v. \nPhilips Elecs. N. Am. Corp., No. CIVA 09 -80-JJF-MPT, 2010 WL 1609899, at *2 (D. Del. \nApr. 20, 2010)  (\u201c[T]he standard under Rule 15(d) is \u2018essentially the same\u2019 as that under \nRule  15(a), and leave to supplement should be granted unless it causes undue delay or \nundue prejudice.\u201d ). 4 have sought amendment prior to the deadline.  (D.I. 163 at 4\u20135).  Second, Apex points out that it \n\u201cpromptly sought amendment after learning that Axos would not agree to reasonable proposals to address its standing allegations.\u201d  ( Id. at 5).  Axos believes that diligence should be measured from \nthe time that Apex assigned the M ark and , accordingly , argues that Apex was not diligent because \nit \u201cdid not notify Axos or even the Court of the assignment\u201d for seven months.  (D.I. 166 at 6).  \nMoreover, Axos asserts that Apex was not diligent because Apex only sought leave to amend after Axos sought to move to dismiss Apex\u2019s suit.  ( Id.).   \n The Court believes that Apex has shown \u201cgood cause\u201d to modify the Scheduling Order.  \nAs Apex points out, the April 30, 2021 transfer of the Mark occurred a little less than a year after \nthe Scheduling Order\u2019s deadline had passed.  More importantly, Apex was reasonably diligent in seeking leave to amend once Axos raised the issue of standing.  Although Apex moved to amend its Complaint seven months after the assignment of the Mark, this does not evidence a lack of diligence because Apex reasonably believed, and still believes,  that it has standing to assert its \nclaims without Fintech as a party.  Therefore, t o find Apex not diligent for failing to amend its \npleading would be to penalize it for not asserting a fact that it reasonably believed was legally irrelevant.  The Court will not do that.    Two days after Axos raised its concerns with Apex, Apex moved fo r leave to amend the \npleadings to add Fintech as a plaintiff.  (D.I. 151 \u00b6 49).  Shortly thereafter, Apex and Fintech executed a formal license agreement that purports to make Apex the exclusive licensee of the Mark.\n4  (D.I. 161, Ex. C).   A month after th e Court postponed the parties\u2019 trial to allow for more \n \n4  Axos points out that Apex may not be an exclusive licensee because the license agreement \nstates that \u201cLicensor hereby grants to Licensee . . . the excl usive right and license ( along \nwith Licensor ) to use the Trademarks on or in association with the Licensed Services in the \nUnited States.\u201d  D.I. 161, Ex. C \u00b6 1 (emphasis added).  W hether Apex is an exclusive 5 careful deliberation of the question of standing, Apex formally filed a motion seeking the Court\u2019s \nleave to amend and supplement its complaint.  (D.I. 162).  All told, Apex diligently moved for leave to amend the Complaint once Axos raised its concern.  Accordingly, Apex has established \nthat there is good cause to modify the scheduling order to allow for an amended pleading.  \n Further, the Court grants Apex\u2019s motion for leave to amend and supplement its Complaint \nunder Rule 15(d).  Axos believes that \u201camendment should be denied under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) because of Apex Clearing\u2019s undue delay, evidencing a dilatory motive to avoid its standing defect, and the undue and substantial prejudice to Axos by adding a new party, on which no discovery has been previously provided, on the eve of trial.\u201d  (D.I. 158 at 15).  As explained above, the Court disagrees with Axos\u2019s contentions that Apex has unduly delayed in moving this Court to amend its pleading or that it had any unsavory motive in not moving to amend its pleading prior to Axos raising the issue of standing.  The Court further finds that no prejudice will result from Apex amending its pleading to add Fintech as a party.  No trial date is currently set.\n5  Further, Apex\u2019s \namendment will not allow it to assert a new claim, pursue a new theory, or seek new or different damages.  Because Axos both will not suffer prejudice as a result of Apex\u2019s amendment and did not show that Apex acted with bad faith, and be cause amendment would clearly not be futile, the \nCourt will grant Apex leave to file a second amended complaint. \n \nlicensee, however,  does not  bear on the question of standing because the Court is permitting \nApex to amend its pleading and add Fintech as a co- plaintiff.  \n \n5  Axos raised the issue of standing in the parties\u2019 p retrial order, less than two months before \nthe previously scheduled trial .  Axos proposed that the Court permit expedited briefing on \nthe question of standing, which was rejected in light of the Court\u2019s heavy docket.  (D.I. 165 \nat 5:20\u20136:6).  Axos then agreed to postpone trial to permit the issue of standing to be \nbriefed.  ( Id. at 7:8 \u201316).  The parties\u2019 trial has yet to be rescheduled.  6 II. Axos\u2019s Motion t o Dismiss \n Because the Court is granting Plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend, it will deny as moot Defendant\u2019s \nmotion to dismiss (D. I. 157) as it relates to the First Amended Complaint (D.I. 48).   \nIII. Axos\u2019s Request for Limited Discovery and Sanctions  \nAxos requests \u201climited discovery\u201d should the Court grant Apex\u2019s motion to amend its \ncomplaint.  (D.I. 166 at 9\u201310).  Apex defined \u201clim ited discovery\u201d as \u201cno more than ten \ninterrogatories, twenty document requests, ten requests for admissions, and one Fed. R. Civ. P. \n30(b)(6) deposition of Apex Fintech.\u201d  ( Id.).  Apex opposes the scope and breadth of Axos\u2019s \nrequest and  submits that \u201ca mor e reasonable amount of discovery consists of one or two document \nrequests and a 30(b)(6) deposition of up to three hours in length.  Although Axos\u2019s request seems excessive in light of the nature of Apex\u2019s amendment, the Court agrees that some limited disc overy \nshould be had.  The parties shall meet and confer and come to an agreement about the nature and scope of the limited discovery needed . \nAxos further \u201crequests the Court sanction Plaintiff for its lack of diligence by awarding \nAxos its fees and costs in connection with the Motion to Dismiss and related briefing, and any discovery.\u201d  (D.I. 166 at 10).  The Court will not do so.  As explained above, Apex has not been impermissibly tardy and has concealed nothing in bad faith.  Accordingly, the Court finds  no basis \nfor sanctioning Apex. \nIV. Conclusion \n For the above reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Apex\u2019s Motion for Leave to \nAmend and Supplement (D.I. 162) is GRANTED and Apex\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 157) is DENIED -AS-MOOT .  The parties shall file a status report that includes a  plan for the limited 7 \ndiscovery as well as the parties \u2019 position as to w hen this case will be ready for trial  by \nSeptember  7, 2022.   \n \n       \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika \n       United States District Judge  "}
