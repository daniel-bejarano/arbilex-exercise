Andrews", "date": "12-06-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nIN RE: TK HOLDINGS , INC., et al., \nDebtors. \nROBERT MONTREAL , \nAppellant, \nV. \nERIC D. GREEN, in his capacity as trustee \nof the PSAN PI/WD Trust d/b/a/ the Takata : \nAirbag Tort Compensation Trust Fund, \nAppellee. Chapter 11 \nBankruptcy Case No. 17-11375 (BLS) \n(Jointly Administered) \nCivil Action No. 21-1589-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPending before this Court is prose appellant Robert Montreal 's Motion to \"Reinstate \" \n(D.I. 21) (the \"Motion\") which appears to seek reconsideration of the Court's September 29, \n2022 order (D.I. 20) (\"Dismissal Order\") dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. For the \nreasons set forth below, Appellant 's Motion is denied. \n1. Background. On November 10, 2021, Appellant filed a document considered to \nbe a Notice of Appeal (D.I. 1) from an October 21, 2020 Order of the Bankruptcy Court, which \ndismissed Appellant 's claims, among others, against the bankruptcy estate of the above\u00ad\ncaptioned Debtors (D.I. 1-1). Appellant 's Notice of Appeal was filed more than a year after the \nexpiry of the 14-day appeal deadline provided pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 8002(a), and \nAppellant failed to seek an extension from the Bankruptcy Court by showing excusable neglect \nof the time within which to appeal. \n2. Without a timely notice of appeal, I do not have appellate jurisdiction over the \nappeal. \"[T]he prescribed timeline within which an appeal from a bankruptcy court must be filed is mandatory and jurisdictional. \" In re Caterbone , 640 F.3d 108, 110 (3d Cir. 2011). \nAccordingly , on September 29, 2022, I entered the Dismissal Order. \n3. On October 25, 2022, Robert Montreal filed the instant Motion, which asks this \nCourt to \"reinstate\" his appeal. There is no \"reinstatement\" remedy provided for under Part VIII \nof the Bankruptcy Rules, which govern bankruptcy appeals to this Court. See generally Fed. R. \nBankr. P. 8001-8028; see also Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8001(a) (\"These Part VIII rules govern the \nprocedure in a United States district court ... on appeal from a judgment , order, or decree of a \nbankruptcy court.\"); D. Del. L.R. 7.l.2(c), 7.l.3(c),(f) (providing , inter alia, that \"[b]ankruptcy \nappeals shall be exempt from the requirements of this Rule, and shall instead conform to the \nrequirements of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and Part VIII of the Local Rules of \nBankruptcy Practice and Procedure of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of \nDelaware \"). Notably, there is no \"motion for reconsideration \" under the Bankruptcy Rules \neither. However , if construed liberally, in light of Appellant's prose status, the remedy \nAppellant seeks in the Motion is most closely aligned with a \"motion for rehearing\" under \nBankruptcy Rule 8022. Accordingly , I will construe the Motion as a request for rehearing. The \nMotion is fully briefed. (D .I. 21, 23 ). 1 \n4. Applicable standard. \"When a district court is acting as an appellate court in a \nbankruptcy case, Bankruptcy Rule 8022 provides the sole mechanism for filing a motion for \nrehearing.\" US. Dep 't of Justice v. Hudson, 2009 WL 7172812 , at *3 (N.D.N.Y. July 8, 2009) \n(addressing predecessor Rule 8015) (quoting In re Spiegel, Inc., 2007 WL 2609966 , at* 1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2007)). A motion for rehearing under Bankruptcy Rule 8022 \"functions , \n1 Notwithstanding Bankruptcy Rule 8022(a)(3) , the Court has considered the response filed by \nappellee, Eric D. Green, in his capacity as trustee of the PSAN PVWD Trust d/b/a the Takata \nAirbag Tort Compensation Trust Fund, pursuant to D. Del. LR 7.l.5(a). \n2 essentially , like a traditional motion for reconsideration .\" Lau v. Bank of America, NA. (In re \nLau), 684 F. App'x 235, 239 (3d Cir. 2017). The Third Circuit test under Bankruptcy Rule 8022 \nis whether \"(l) the court has patently misunderstood a party; (2) the court has made a decision \noutside the adversarial issues presented ... by the parties; (3) the court has made an error not of \nreasoning but of apprehension; or ( 4) there has been a controlling or significant change in the law \nor facts since the submission of the issue to the Court.\" Lau, 684 F. App'x at 239. \n5. The standard that a movant \"must meet to prevail on a motion for reconsideration \nis high.\" Zokaites Properties LP v. La Mesa Racing, LLC, 2011 WL 2293283, at *l (W.D. Pa. \nJune 9, 2011) (citing Berry v. Jacobs IMC, LLC, 99 F. App'x 405,410 (3d Cir. 2004)). A \nBankruptcy Rule 8022 motion \"does not permit parties to recycle cases and arguments which the \nDistrict Court already rejected in rendering its original decision.\" Lau, 684 F. App'x at 239. \"A \nparty's mere disagreement with the Court does not translate into the type of clear error of law \nwhich justifies reconsideration of a ruling.\" Zokaites, 2011 WL 2293283, at *1; see also Dare \nInvs., LLC v. Chi. Title Ins. Co., 2011 WL 5513196, at *5 (D.N.J. Nov. 10, 2011). Moreover , \nreargument and reconsideration requests \"are not a substitute for an appeal from a final \njudgment \" nor are they an opportunity for \"endless debate between the parties and the Court.\" \nBrambles USA, Inc. v. Blocker, 735 F. Supp. 1239, 1240 (D. Del. 1990). \n6. Finally, because Appellant proceeds prose, this Court must construe the Motion \nliberally. Appellant 's prose status has no significance when it comes to ajurisdictional defect \nSee In re Sobczak-Slomc zewski, 826 F.3d 429, 432 (7th Cir. 2016) (\"there are no equitable \nexceptions to a jurisdictional requirement. \") (citing Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205,214 (2007)). \n7. Analysis. Appellant argues for reconsideration (\"reinstatement \") on the basis that \nthis Court overlooked or misapprehended the law or the facts in this case. More specifically , \nAppellant asserts that this Court has jurisdiction to hear his appeal because the Notice of Appeal \n3 was mistakenly \"filed in another court\" under \"Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002[(a)](4) \"2 (see D.I. 21, p. 2 \nof 49) and was sent within the 14-day period (id, p. 8 of 49). Appellant 's Motion also attaches \n\"postal receipts\" as evidence that the Notice of Appeal was sent by certified mail on November \n5, 2020 and that he had \"14 days to file plus 3 days if appeal is sent by U.S. mail.\" (See id.) \n8. \"It is well settled that a notice of appeal or a petition for review is filed once the \nCourt of Appeals receives actual custody of the document. \" City of Chicago v. US Dep 't of \nLabor, 737 F.2d 1466, 1471 (7th Cir. 1984). In most circumstances , the date stamped on the \nnotice of appeal will be the date of filing. In re Syntax-Brillian Corp., 610 F. App'x 132, 134 \n(3d Cir. 2015). However, the Third Circuit has previously observed that the date stamped on the \nnotice of appeal by a court clerk is not always conclusive of the date of filing. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Solly, 545 F.2d 874, 876 (3d Cir. 1976) (construing Fed. R. App. P. 4). The Third \nCircuit has determined that \"whenever a notice of appeal is filed in a district court, it is filed as \nof the time it is actually received in the clerk's office even though it is designated as filed by the \nclerk's office at a later date.\" Id. \n9. The Dismissal Order sets forth the October 21, 2020 date of the Bankruptc y Court \norder from which Appellant appealed. Accordingly , to have been timely filed, Appellant needed \nhis Notice of Appeal to have been actually received by the clerk's office on or before November \n4, 2020. See Solly, 545 F.2d at 876. Even assuming Appellant sent his Notice of Appeal via \ncertified mail on November 5, 2020, as he asserts , the Notice of Appeal remains untimely filed. \nSee, e.g., Fed. Bankr. R. 8002(a)(l) (notice of appeal must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk \n2 Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002(a)(4) governs mistaken filing of a notice of appeal \nin another court and provides, \"If a notice of appeal is mistakenly filed in a district court, BAP, \nor court of appeals, the clerk of that court must state on the notice the date on which it was \nreceived and transmit it to the bankruptcy clerk. The notice of appeal is then considered filed in \nthe bankruptcy court on the date so stated.\" \n4 \"within 14 days after entry of the judgment , order, or decree being appealed\"). Mailing the \nNotice of Appeal on or after such deadline, even if by certified mail, and even if mistakenly to \nanother court, does not comport with the Bankruptc y Rule 8002(a)(l). \n10. The Motion does not assert with any particularity that this Court misunderstood \nAppellant, made a decision outside the adversarial issues presented by the parties, made an error \nof apprehension, or been presented with a significant change in law or facts. The issue of \nwhether Appellant timely filed his appeal has already been presented and decided. Appellant \nfails to present new facts or law that would provide a basis to change the Court's ruling in the \nDismissal Order. Even accepting Appellant's allegations as true, the fact that Appellant cannot \nevidence receipt of the Notice of Appeal by the clerk within the 14-day period remains fatal. \n11. Moreover, the Motion itself was untimely. Bankruptcy Rule 8022 provides that \n\"[u]nless time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, any motion for rehearing by the \ndistrict court or BAP must be filed within 14 days after entry of the judgment on appeal.\" Fed. \nR. Bankr. P. 8022(a)(l) . D. Del. LR 7.1.5(a) provides in relevant part that \"[i]f a party chooses \nto file a motion for reargument, said motion shall be filed within 14 days after the Court issues \nits opinion or decision ... \" D. Del. LR 7.l.5(a). The Dismissal Order was docketed and served on \nSeptember 29, 2022, Appellant 's Motion is dated October 19, 2022, and the Motion was \ndocketed on October 25, 2022. Appellant was required to file his Rule 8022 Motion by October \n13, 2022, which he failed to do. Accordingly , Appellant 's Motion was untimely. \n12. Conclusion. Appellant's untimely Motion fails to satisfy the standard under \nBankruptcy Rule 8022. The Motion is therefore denied. \nct Judge \nf'J1b/ 2-2--\n5 "}
