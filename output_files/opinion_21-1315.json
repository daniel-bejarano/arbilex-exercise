Andrews \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge: \nPlaintiff Soloman McCormick , an inmate at Howard R. Young Correctional \ntnstitution in Wilmington , Delaware , filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. \n\\\u2022 ,\u00b7 \n3). Plaintiff appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. \n(D.I. 5). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a) . \n/s1 , ,:i \nj BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff alleges that he \"was neglected of care and/or concern\" when he \nbbntracted COVID-19 . (D.I. 3 at 5). He alleges his treatment consisted of temperature \nand oxygen/pulse checks. (Id.). He alleges that he was moved from unit to unit with no \nregard for his well-being or the well-being of other inmates. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that \nR~fen_dan~s ~new of his underlying heart condition and did not provide him proper \n~rotection and care. (Id. at 6). Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages and a reduction \nin sentence . (Id. at 8). \nt~ SCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \n~ \ni:frovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or \nhlalicious, fa_ils to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary \nJ \nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \n1 Case 1:21-cv-01315-VAC   Document 7   Filed 05/09/22   Page 2 of 7 PageID #: 28I , \ndefendant) ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison \n',\",'-\n2onditions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \n,, \nl_J \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nl ' ' complaint, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94. \n' \ner A complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \n~ \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it ~epends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \n':fantastic or delusional \" factual scenario.\"' Id. \n(' The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00b7\u00a7 1915( e )(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b )( 1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nr~ling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \nt999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nLJpon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 \nF'.3d 103, 114 (30 Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions . \nir\", \n\u00b7f< \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 \nl! \n2 \nI:\u00b7.\u00b7 Case 1:21-cv-01315-VAC   Document 7   Filed 05/09/22   Page 3 of 7 PageID #: 29(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility . See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not \nd\u00b7ismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted. See id. at 11. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations , assume their veracity and then \nd~termine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane \ntonstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting' Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \nicontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \n~ i} and common sense.\" Id. \nDISCUSSION \nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996, a prisoner must pursue all \n1:ivailable avenues for relief through the prison's grievance system before bringing a \nf\u00a5deral civil rights action. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, \nt -~ \n7-41 n.6 (2001) (\"[A]n inmate must exhaust irrespective of the forms of relief sought and \noffered through administrative avenues.\"). Section 1997(e) provides, \"No action shall \nbe brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of the Revised Statutes \nG.\u00b7.1 re \n! \n--\u00bc \n,' -3 Case 1:21-cv-01315-VAC   Document 7   Filed 05/09/22   Page 4 of 7 PageID #: 30of the United States, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, \nor other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are \nexhausted. \"\u00b7,42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997(e). The exhaustion requirement is mandatory . Williams \nv. Beard, 482 F.3d 637, 639 (3d Cir. 2007); Booth, 532 U.S. at 742 (holding that the \nexhaustion requirement of the PLRA applies to grievance procedures \"regardless of the \nrelief offered through administrative procedures \"). The limitations period for filing \u00a7 \n1983 action is tolled during the period that a prisoner spends exhausting his \nacjministrative remedies. See Jones v. Unknown D. 0. C. Bus Driver & Transportation \n0rew,\u00b7 944'F.3d 478, 480 (3d Cir. 2019). \nThere is no futility exception to \u00a7 1997e's exhaustion requirement. Nyhuis v. \nI/Zeno, 204 F.3d 65, 75-76 (3d Cir. 2000). An inmate must fully satisfy the administrative \nF~quirements of the inmate grievance process before proceeding into federal court. \nSpruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218 (3d Cir. 2004); see also Oriakhi v. United States, 165 F. \n~pp'x 991, 993 (3d Cir. 2006) (providing that \"there appears to be unanimous circuit \n'burt consehsus that a prisoner may not fulfill the PLRA's exhaustion requirement by \nexhausting administrative remedies after the filing of the complaint in federal court\"). \n,.\u2022,r: \nCourts have concluded that inmates who fail to fully, or timely, complete the prison \ngtrievance process are barred from subsequently litigating claims in federal court. See, \ne.g., Booth v. Churner, 206 F.3d 289 (3d Cir. 2000). \nIf the actions of prison officials directly caused the inmate's procedural default on . ' \n\u00b7< grievance , the inmate will not be held to strict compliance with this exhaustion \n4 \n, ,, Case 1:21-cv-01315-VAC   Document 7   Filed 05/09/22   Page 5 of 7 PageID #: 31requirement. See Camp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d 279 (3d Cir. 2000). In addition, an \ninmate's failure to exhaust will be excused \"under certain limited circumstances ,\" Harris \nv. Armstrong, 149 F. App'x 58, 59 (3d Cir. 2005), and an inmate can defeat a claim of \nfailure to exhaust only by showing \"he was misled or that there was some extraordinary \nreason he was prevented from complying with the statutory mandate .\" Davis v. \nWarman, 49 F. App'x 365, 368 (3d Cir. 2002); see also See Ross v Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 543 (2016) (an administrative procedure is not available when it operates as a \n~imple dead end; when it is so opaque that it becomes incapable of use; and when \nprison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process \ntfirough machination , misinterpretation, or intimidation .). Further, \"administrative \nr~medies are not 'available ' under the PLRA where a prison official inhibits an inmate \nfrom resorting to them through serious threats of retaliation and bodily harm.\" Rinaldi v. \n'United States, 904 F.3d 257, 267 (3d Cir. 2018). \nt / While exhaustion is an affirmative defense, the Court may sua sponte dismiss an \na~tion pursuant to \u00a7 1915A when the failure to exhaust defense is obvious from the face \n,.,rit,. \n6f the complaint. See Caiby v. Haidle, 785 F. App'x 64, 65 (3d Cir. 2019). Plaintiff \n!fdmits that the grievance process was not complete when he filed his Complaint. He \nstates that he submitted his grievance but as of the date he filed the complaint he had \nh'ot yet received a response. Given Plaintiffs admission in the Complaint that the \n\\ \ngrievance process was not complete when he filed this action, dismissal for failure to \nttc \nL b1 \n; \u00b7; 5 :n \nl l \n~ \nJi\u00b7 \nle \n~ ' Case 1:21-cv-01315-VAC   Document 7   Filed 05/09/22   Page 6 of 7 PageID #: 32exhaust is warranted .
