{"case_name": "Davis-Collins v. City of Wilmington et al", "case_number": "20-758", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "04-22-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nLEONETTE DA VIS-COLLINS, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCITY OF WILIMINGTON; TANYA \nWASHINGTON , individually and in her official \ncapacity; JENNIFER PRADO, individually and in \nher official capacity; CHARLOTTE BARNES , \nindividually and in her official capacity; SHEILA \nMARTIN , individually and in her official capacity; \nROBERT J. TRACY, individually and in his official \ncapacity; and KEITH BROOKS , \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 20-758-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff moves under Local Rule 7.1.5 for re-argument of my order (D.I. 21, 22) granting \nDefendants ' motion to dismiss Count V of Plaintiff's Complaint , discrimination based on sex under \nSection 710 of the Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act (DDEA). (D.I. 28). I have \nconsidered the Plaintiff's motion and Defendants ' response (D.I. 33). \nA motion for re-argument under Local Rule 7.1.5 may be granted under one of three \ncircumstances: (1) \"where the Court has patently misunderstand a party,\" (2) \"where the Court has \nmade a decision outside the adversarial issues presented to the Court by the parties,\" or (3) \"where \nthe Court has made an error not of reasoning but of apprehension. \" Schering Corp. v. Amgen, Inc., \n25 F. Supp.2d 293, 295 (D. Del. 1998) (cleaned up). A motion for re-argument \"should be denied \n1 where the proponent simply rehashes materials and theories already briefed, argued, and decided.\" \nId. \nThe Third Circuit has more generally explained that a motion for reconsideration may be \ngranted where a party shows at least one of the following: \"(1) an intervening change in the \ncontrolling law; (2) the availability of new evidence that was not available when the court granted \nthe [motion to dismiss]; or (3) the need to correct a clear error oflaw or fact or to prevent manifest \ninjustice.\" Max's Seafood Cafe ex rel. Lou-Anna , Inc. v. Quinteros , 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir. \n1999). \nHere, Plaintiff does not raise any changes in the controlling law nor the availability of new \nevidence. Plaintiff instead alleges (1) legal error in my finding that Plaintiff had not alleged \nharassment sufficiently \"severe or pervasive \" to state a claim under the DDEA, because \"courts \nhave regularly found that the severe or pervasive factor is not amenable to resolution in a motion \nto dismiss\" (D.I. 28 ,r 10), and (2) that, in concluding that Plaintiff's allegation of physical sexual \nassault by Defendant Brooks was not actionable against the City of Wilmington because it was an \nunforeseen assault by a non-employee in a public space, I decided an issue outside of those \npresented by the parties. (Id. ,r 15). \nWith respect to Plaintiff's first argument , I do not think Plaintiff has identified a \"clear \nerror of law\" warranting re-argument and reconsideration. The cases Plaintiff cites in support of \nthe proposition that \"the severe or pervasive factor is not amenable to resolution in a motion to \ndismiss\" all involve factual circumstances where the pervasiveness or severity of the allegations \nwas either clearly greater or more uncertain than the allegations here. See Sztroin v. PennWest \nIndus. Truck, LLC, 2017 WL 4355575, at *5-6 (W. D. Pa 2017) (plaintiff alleged, \"Defendants \n2 consistently treated her differently from the male employees ; they excluded her from necessary \nmeetings and communications essential to perform her job;\" \"she was systematically shunned by \nher boss for three years, she was precluded from interacting with her subordinate employees and \nimportant clients\"); Blazevich v. Star hotels, Inc., 2021 WL 1214688, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 31, \n2021) (plaintiff alleged, \"On numerous occasions Defendant Shilling would position his person in \nthe hallway entrance to the hotel rooms that Plaintiff was cleaning, resulting in Plaintiff being \nphysically trapped,\" and, \"Defendant Shilling used Plaintiff's housekeeping service cart to block \nPlaintiff from escaping and then 'touched, groped and assaulted ' Plaintiff without her consent, \nmaking sexual advances and grasping her body while physically preventing her from escaping\"); \nHill v. Corinthian Condo. Ass'n Inc., 2021 WL 1124782, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 24, 2021) (finding \nthat although the alleged harassing comments were \"facially nondiscriminatory ,\" they were \n\"susceptible to an argument that they exhibit racial and/or religious animus\"); Spain v. Gallegos, \n26 F.3d 439, 448-49 (3d Cir. 1994) (finding that where Plaintiff alleged she \"was subjected to the \nspreading of false rumors about her sexual affairs that impugned the integrity of her job \nperformance ,\" and \"led supervisory personnel to evaluate Spain negatively for advancement \npurposes,\" there were \"factual questions for trial of whether the rumors developed and persisted \nas a result of [defendant 's] improper behavior\"). I agree with Plaintiff that in situations where the \nseverity or pervasiveness of the alleged harassment is uncertain , dismissal before discovery is \ninappropriate. \nBy contrast, here, discovery would not aid Plaintiff for two reasons. First, there is no \nuncertainty around the pervasiveness of the harassment -Plaintiff alleged a discrete number of \nencounters with Defendant Brooks. Plaintiff was present for each incident; if there was something \n3 more that happened in any of the incidents, she could have alleged it. 1 Second, I found that \nPlaintiff's allegations of harassment attributable to the City of Wilmington (that is, the four non\u00ad\nphysical incidents), viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, were not severe enough to state \na claim under Title VII (and therefore under the DDEA). The very purpose of the \"viewed in the \nlight most favorable to the non-moving party\" standard is to construct a hypothetical scenario in \nwhich all of Plaintiff's allegations have been borne out by the evidence. If, even then, Plaintiff has \nfailed to state a claim, then discovery would be futile. \nWith respect to Plaintiff's second argument , I do not agree that my decision was \"outside \nthe adversarial issues presented to the Court by the parties.\" Schering, 25 F. Supp.2d at 295. The \nissue presented by the parties was whether Plaintiff's allegations of harassment stated a claim \nagainst the City of Wilmington under the DDEA. Defendants argued in their opening brief, \"Case \nlaw interpreting the Civil Rights [ A ]ct of 1964 ('Title VII') is instructive in analyzing DDEA \nclaims.\" (D.I. 7 at 17 n.4). Andrews v. City of Philadelphia, 895 F.2d 1469, 1482 (3d Cir. 1990), \nthe case Defendants cited in their opening brief as authority for the Third Circuit's hostile work \nenvironment standard, holds that respondeat superior liability is one of five necessary elements \nfor establishing the existence of a hostile work environment under Title VII. Therefore , although \nDefendants did not expressly make this argument in their opening brief, my finding that the City \nof Wilmington cannot be held liable for the unforeseeable conduct of a non-employee in a public \nspace was well within the scope of \"the adversarial issues presented to the Court by the parties.\" \nRegardless , Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to plausibly show that the City of \nWilmington was on notice of Defendant Brooks' inappropriate conduct such that the initial March \nI dismissed Count V without prejudice . \n4 2017 assault should have been foreseeable to the City. Plaintiff's only allegation related to the \nCity's pre-March 2017 knowledge of Brooks' behavior is that when Plaintiff discussed Brooks' \nharassment with Defendant Martin, sometime after July 23, 2018, \"Defendant Martin stated 'Is \nthat the one always saying Good Morning Beautiful and kissing everybody 's hand?\"' (D.I. 1 ,r 37). \nThis vague statement, made over a year after the assault occurred, referencing undated and \ndifferent behavior, is insufficient to plausibly show the March 2017 assault was foreseeable to the \nCity of Wilmington. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff's motion for re-argument (D.I. 28) is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nEntered this 'J} day of April, 2022. \n5 "}
