{"case_name": "The Hunt Irrevocable Trust et al v. Air Medical Group Holdings, LLC", "case_number": "21-679", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "03-11-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nTHE HUNT IRREVOCABLE TRUST, \net al., \nPlaintiff, \nV. Civil Action No. 21cv679-RGA \nAIR MEDICAL GROUP HOLDING , LLC, : \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nI consider de nova Defendant's objections (D.I. 21) to the magistrate judge's R&R (D.I. \n18). \nThe first objection , that Plaintiffs disclaimed reliance on\u00a7 6.06(b) as a provision of the \ncontract that was breached , strikes me as frivolous . Defendant quotes part of Plaintiffs' brief \n(D.I. 21 at 2, quoting D.I. 14 at 15), but in my view, it is a misreading of the brief. The first \nobjection is OVERRULED . \nThe second objection relates to the question of whether the settlement payment paid in \nMarch 2020 (D.I. 9 at ,r 20; D.I. 11 at 6) is \"Retained Property\" the Defendant needed to tum \nover to Plaintiffs. There are arguments about why Plaintiffs' theory does not make sense ( at \nleast some of which are not properly considered on a motion to dismiss), but the settlement \npayment seems to literally fall within the description of Retained Property in the second part of \nExhibit E-1. Thus, Plaintiffs plausibly allege a breach of contract, and the second objection is \nOVERRULED. \nPage 1 of 2 The third objection, concerning the statute of limitations, is OVERRULED. It is not \napparent from the face of the complaint and the contract that the statute of limitations bars the \ncomplaint. \nThe fourth objection, to the unjust enrichment count, might have some merit, but it is \npremature to reach that conclusion when Defendant has not yet filed an answer to the Amended \nComplaint. The fourth objection is OVERRULED. \nThe R&R (D.1. 18) is ADOPTED to the extent necessary to the above discussion. The \nmotion to dismiss (DJ. 10) is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this Jl_ day of March 2022. \nPage 2 of 2 "}
