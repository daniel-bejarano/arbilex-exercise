{"case_name": "Skeans v. Key Commercial Finance LLC et al", "case_number": "18-1516", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "01-24-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nDEBORAH S. SKEANS, Executrix \nof the ESTATE OF FRANKE. \nPAVLIS, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nKEY COMivIERCIAL FINANCE, \nLLC, KEY COMJvIERCIAL \nFINANCE PROPERTIES, LLC, \nEQUITY PROS, LLC, and MOBILE \nAGENCY, LLC, \nDefendants, \nJEFFREY PETERSON, \nIntervenor. Civil Action No. 18-1516-CFC-MPT \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPending before me are Jeffrey Peterson's motion to intervene (D.I. 108) and \nmotion for leave to file a motion to strike (D.I. 113). \nPeterson filed the motion to intervene on July 21, 2021. D.I. 108. He cited \nas the basis for the motion Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)(l)(B). That rule \nprovides that \"[ o ]n timely motion, the court may permit anyone to intervene who ... has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of \nlaw or fact.\" \nPeterson did not state expressly in the motion why he seeks intervention. \nThe motion alleges, however, that the Supplemental Complaint filed by Plaintiff in \nthis action accuses Peterson and nonparty Justin Billingsley of creating a payday \nloan start-up called LoanGo that participated in \"fraudulent enterprises.\" D.I. 108 \nat 2. And it alleges that paragraphs 35 through 75 of the Supplemental Complaint \n\"paint\" Peterson, his company (Mobile Corporation), and Billingsley collectively \n\"as a criminal enterprise that swindled unwitting investors out of their money \nwithout remorse.\" D.I. 108 at 2. The motion also states that \"[t]hese false and \ndefamatory assertions were fed to the Plaintiffs lawyer by an individual long\u00ad\nharboring a grudge against Mr. Peterson, as will be evidenced in the Intervener's \nMotion to Strike the allegations from the record.\" D.I. 108 at 2. Thus, the motion \nimpliedly seeks intervention to file a motion to strike. \nPlaintiff Deborah S. Skeans, Executrix of the Estate of Frank E. Pavlis, filed \nan opposition to Peterson's motion on August 4, 2021. D.I. 110. Skeans did not \n(and to this day does not) dispute Peterson's characterization of the Supplemental \nComplaint's allegations about him and his companies. But Skeans argued in her \nopposition that I should deny Peterson's intervention motion for three reasons: ( 1) \nit's untimely; (2) it's \"procedurally improper\" because it was not accompanied by \n2 a pleading; and (3) it fails to allege a common question of law or fact. In support \nof this third argument, Skeans stated that this case \narises out of two investments that Mr. Pavlis made in \n2014, totaling $7,000,000, in a company named Allwest \nInvestments, LLC (\"Allwest\") at the direction of a \n\"financial advisor,\" Justin Billingsley. Unbeknownst to \nMr. Pavlis, Mr. Billingsley subsequently orchestrated a \nscheme by which the funds Mr. Pavlis invested in \nAllwest were transferred to Defendant Key Commercial \nFinance, LLC, (\"Key Commercial\") which Mr. \nBillingsley controlled. \n* * * * \nThe attempted Intervenor, Jeffrey Peterson, is an \nunrelated third party who is not connected to either \nPlaintiff or, upon information belief, to any of the \nDefendants. Plaintiff does not allege that Mr. Peterson \nwas involved in the Allwest-Key Commercial fraud \nscheme in any manner, or that he is otherwise related to \nthe issues at stake in this case. The few references to Mr. \nPeterson in the Supplemental Complaint, which were \nalso included in the original Verified Complaint, relate to \nMr. Billingsley's prior dealings with Mr. Peterson and \npre-date Mr. Billingsley's involvement with Mr. Pavlis. \n* * * * \nThe case is limited to the narrow circumstances \nsurrounding Mr. Pavlis' [ s] investment, the subsequent \ntransfer of Mr. Pavlis'[s] funds from Allwest to Key \nCommercial, and the creation of the Key Commercial \nPromissory Notes. \nD.I. 110 at 2-4 ( citations and emphasis omitted). \nOn August 18, 2021, Peterson filed his motion for leave to file a motion to \nstrike. He seeks by that motion permission to move to strike those portions of the \nSupplemental Complaint and Joint Pretrial Order that allege that he and his \n3 companies engaged in fraudulent and criminal schemes. D.I. 113. Peterson \nattached to the motion a proposed motion to strike. \nSkeans argues that Peterson's motion for leave is premature because the \nmotion to intervene remains pending. D.I. 114 at 2. And, notwithstanding what \nshe represented to the Court in her opposition to Peterson's intervention motion, \nSkeans argues that the motion for leave is improper and futile because the \nchallenged allegations about Peterson and his company in the Supplemental \nComplaint and Joint Pretrial Order are \"directly related to, and probative of' \nmaterial issues in this action. D.I. 114 at 4-5. \nI reject Skean's argument that the motion to intervene is untimely. Peterson \nfiled his motion on July 21, 2021-approximately three months after the \nSupplemental Complaint was filed (April 15, 2021) and within days of the filing of \nthe Joint Pretrial Order (July 2, 2021). Moreover, in determining the timeliness of \na party's Rule 24(b) motion, courts consider whether another party was prejudiced \nby any delay in the filing of the motion, see In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., 695 \nF .2d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1982); and Skeans does not allege, let alone demonstrate, \nthat the timing of the motion to intervene prejudices her in any way. Skeans \nargues that the motion is untimely because the allegations Peterson seeks to strike \nfrom the Supplemental Complaint were \"included in\" the Verified Complaint filed \nin October 2018 and Peterson was made aware of the Verified Complaint two days \n4 after it was filed. D.I. 110 at 8. But Peterson doesn't seek to strike portions of the \nVerified Complaint. He seeks only to strike portions of the Supplemental \nComplaint and the Joint Pretrial Order. \nI agree with Skeans, however, that Peterson's intervention motion was \nprocedurally defective. Rule 24( c) provides that a motion to intervene \"must state \nthe grounds for intervention and be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the \nclaim or defense for which intervention is sought.\" Peterson's intervention motion \nwas not accompanied by a pleading and therefore he failed to comply with Rule \n24(c). Accordingly, I will deny the motion. \nI will nonetheless strike the allegations in the Supplemental Complaint and \nJoint Pretrial Order challenged by Peterson. Rule 12(f)(l) provides that a court \n\"may act ... on its own\" to \"strike from a pleading ... any redundant, immaterial, \nimpertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Skeans has admitted that the challenged \nallegations are immaterial. She represented to the Court that \"[t]he case is limited \nto the narrow circumstances surrounding Mr. Pavlis'[s] investment, the subsequent \ntransfer of Mr. Pavlis' [ s] funds from All west to Key Commercial, and the creation \nof the Key Commercial Promissory Notes\" and that she herself \"does not allege \nthat Mr. Peterson was involved in the Allwest-Key Commercial fraud scheme in \nany manner, or that he is otherwise related to the issues at stake in this case.\" \n5 D.I. 110 at 3-4. It is also undisputed that if the allegations are not in fact true then \nthey are impertinent and scandalous. \nI find it fundamentally unfair and inappropriate for Skeans and her counsel \nto have identified Peterson by name in the Supplemental Complaint and to have \nmade the challenged allegations about him when they did not make him a party to \nthe action. Their treatment of Peterson is all the more egregious, if not \nsanctionable, because, to use their own words, their allegations about Peterson are \nnot \"related to the issues at stake in this case.\" Skeans and her lawyers have used \ntheir Supplemental Complaint to publicly accuse Peterson of fraud and criminal \nconduct, but they have denied him an opportunity to defend himself against their \naccusations. They seem to think they can do so with impunity because they made \ntheir accusations in a court pleading. See D.I. 110 at 5 (arguing that any \ndefamation claim by Peterson \"would be legally deficient, as it is well settled that \nallegations contained in pleadings are absolutely privileged\"). Whether they are \ncorrect in that regard, I leave for another day. \nBecause I am striking of my own accord the challenged allegations, I will \ndeny as moot Peterson's motion for leave to file a motion to strike. \nNOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington on this Twenty-fourth day of January \nin 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Jeffrey Peterson's Motion for \nPermissive Intervention (D.I. 108) is DENIED and Peterson's Motion for Leave to \n6 File Motion to Strike (D.1. 113) is DENIED as moot. It is FURTHER \nORDERED that paragraphs 35 through 75 of the Supplemental Complaint (D.I. \n102) and all references to Peterson and Mobile Corporation in the Joint Pretrial \nOrder (D.I. 106) are STRUCK. \nCHIEF JUDGE \n7 "}
