The parties have fully briefed the motions. (D.I. 80, 83, 91, 93, 101, 106). I \nheard oral argument on January 4, 2023. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants infringe two of Plaintiff's patents. Those patents are U.S. \nPatent Nos. 9,359,044 (the, '\"044 Patent\") and 9,586,659 (the, '\"659 Patent\") (collectively, the \n\"Asserted Patents\"). The Asserted Patents relate to a personal hydrofoil watercraft. The Asserted \nPatents share a common specification. \nPlaintiff asserts that Defendants ' products infringe all claims of the '044 Patent (claims 1-\n22) and '659 Patent (claims 1-20). Defendant s counterclaimed. (D.I. 13). The parties agree claim \n1 of the '044 Patent and claims 1 and 16 of the '659 Patent are representative of the other claims \nfor purposes of the pending motions. 1 \nPlaintiff has moved for summary judgment of (1) direct infringement of claim 1 of the '044 \nPatent, (2) the '044 Patent and '659 Patent are not anticipated, and (3) Plaintiff has standing. (D.I. \n77, 78, 79). Defendants have moved for summary judgment of (1) claims 16-20 of the '659 Patent \nare invalid for lack of written description , (2) non-infringement of the '044 Patent, and (3) non\u00ad\ninfringement of claims 1-15 ofthe '659Patent. (D.I. 81). \n1 These three claims are the independent claims in the two patents. For purposes of the pending \nmotions, Parties agree that the other elements of the dependent claims are met and only dispute \nas to whether all the claim elements as listed in the three independent claims are infringed by \nDefendants ' products. \n2 II. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. \nCIV. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. Lamont \nv. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242, 248 (1986)). \"[A] dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is sufficient \nto permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. The burden on the \nmoving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of \nevidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 \n(1986). \nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue \nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); Williams \nv. Borough of West Chester, 891 F.2d 458 , 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving party asserting \nthat a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to particular parts \nof materials in the record, including depositions , documents, electronically stored information , \naffidavits or declarations , stipulations ... , admissions , interrogatory answers, or other materials; \nor (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish the absence ... of \na genuine dispute .... \" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)(l). The non-moving party's evidence \"must amount \nto more than a scintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than a \npreponderance.\" Williams, 891 F.2d at 460-61. \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences \nin that party's favor. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007); Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, \n3 184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the non-moving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential \nelement of its case with respect to which it has the burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. INFRINGEMENT OF CLAIMS 1-15 OF THE '659 PATENT \nDefendants have moved for summary judgment on non-infringement of claims 1-15 of the \n'659 Patent (D.I. 80 at 20-26; D.I. 83 at 29-32). The dispute focuses on whether Defendants \ninfringe claim 1 of the '659 Patent. Claims 2-15 depend on claim 1. The claim reads as follows: \n1. A passively stable, weight-shift controlled personal hydrofoil watercraft , \ncompnsmg: \na flotation device that has a fore-aft length greater than a lateral width, the flotation \ndevice having a top surface and a bottom surface, wherein a user can be disposed \non the top surface of the flotation device in a prone, kneeling, or standing position, \nthe flotation device having a forward section, a middle section, and a rear section; \na strut having a upper end and a lower end, the upper end fixedly interconnected \nwith the flotation device between the middle section and the rear section of the \nflotation device; \na hydrofoil fixedly interconnected with the lower end of the strut, the hydrofoil \nhaving no movable surface; \na propulsion system for propelling the watercraft in a body of water, wherein the \npropulsion system is connected to the hydrofoil; and \nthe watercraft having no movable steering system. \n('659 Patent, cl. 1). The parties agree that the preamble of the '659 Patent-A passively stable, \nweight-shift controlled personal hydrofoil watercraft-is limiting. (D.I. 83 at 30; D.I. 91 at 41). The \nparties dispute whether the \"stable\" aspect of the limitation is met. (D.I. 83 at 29-32; D.I. 91 at 43-\n45). \nThere are two issues to this dispute. \n4 The first issue is whether \"stable\" includes both static stability-ha ving an initial tendency \nto return to an original condition when disturbed -and dynamic stability -eventuall y returning to \nan original condition when disturbed. (D.I. 60-2, Ex. B at 602). Defendants argue both are \nincluded; Plaintiff, only static stability. I previousl y construed this term to have its plain and \nordinary meaning but permitted the parties to readdress the issue at this stage of the case. (D.I. 66 \nat 9). Because there is a dispute over the scope of the claim term, I must construe the term before \naddressing the question of infringement. 02 Micro Int'! Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., 521 \nF.3d 1351, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\"A determination that a claim term 'needs no construction ' or \nhas the 'plain and ordinary meaning' may be inadequate ... when reliance on a term's 'ordinary' \nmeaning does not resolve the parties' dispute.\"). \nThe second issue is whether Defendants infringe the stability limitation as construed. \n1. Claim Construction \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) ( en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"' [T]here is no magic formula or \ncatechism for conducting claim construction. ' Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate \nweight to appropriate sources 'in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\"' \nSoftView LLC v. Apple Inc., 2013 WL 4758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (quoting Phillips, \n415 F.3d at 1324) (alteration in original). When construing patent claims, a court considers the \nliteral language of the claim, the patent specification , and the prosecution history. Markman v. \nWestview Instrument s, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 977-80 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 \n(1996). Of these sources, \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction \n5 analysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\" \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning .... \n[Which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question \nat the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application. \" Id. at \n1312-13 ( citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term \nis its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\" Id. at 13 21 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \"In some cases , the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by a person \nof skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases \ninvolves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood \nwords.\" Id. at 1314. \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evidence-the patent claims, the specification , \nand the prosecution history-the court's construction is a determination oflaw. See Teva Pharm. \nUSA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 331 (2015). The court may also make factual findings \nbased upon consideration of extrinsic evidence, which \"consists of all evidence external to the \npatent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries , and learned \ntreatises.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317-19 (internal quotation marks omitted). Extrinsic evidence \nmay assist the court in understanding the underlying technolog y, the meaning of terms to one \nskilled in the art, and how the invention works. Id. Extrinsic evidence, however, is less reliable \nand less useful in claim construction than the patent and its prosecution history. Id. \nDefendants argue that \"stable\" should mean being statically stable and dynamicall y stable. \nDefendants cite to the patent specification and textbooks for support that a person of ordinary skill \nin the art (\"POSA\") would read \"stable\" to require static and dynamic stability. (D.I. 83 at 4-7). \n6 Plaintiff argues that \"stable\" should be interchangeable with statically stable or having \nstatic stability, and therefore , does not require that the watercraft have dynamic stability. (D.I. 91 \nat 22). Plaintiff cites to their expert, Mr. Barry, for support that '\"stable' and 'static stability' are \n'commonl y used interchangeably with respect to aircraft and hydrofoil stability.'\" (D .I. 91 at 18 \n(citing D.I. 80-31, ,r 12)). Mr. Barry also expressed an opinion that the patent uses the terms \ninterchangeably . (Id. at 19). \nI agree with Defendants that \"stable\" should mean having both static stability and dynamic \nstability. I previousl y rejected Plaintiffs argument that \"stable\" and \"static stability\" could be used \ninterchangeably. (D.I. 66 at 9). Plaintiff has not provided compelling intrinsic or extrinsic evidence \nto convince me to deviate from my initial view. Furthermore, the patent specification recites, \"This \ntrim condition is stable if a disturbance results in a restoring moment that returns the hydrofoil to \nits original condition. \" (' 659 Patent, col. 6: 14-16). The hydrofoil returning to its original condition \nis a description of dynamic stability, not static stability. Therefore, the patent specification \nindicates that stable and statically stable ( or static stability) are not interchangeable. \nTherefore , I will construe \"A passively stable, weight-shift controlled personal hydrofoil \nwatercraft\" to mean \"a weight-shift controlled personal watercraft having a hydrofoil that does not \nhave any moveable components and which, when disturbed , (1) has an initial tendency to return \nto its original condition and (2) eventually returns to its original condition.\"2 \n2. Non-Infringement by the Accused Products \nThe remaining issue is whether the accused products have static stability and dynamic \nstability. Defendants argue that their products are dynamically unstable (or lack dynamic stability) \nand Plaintiff has provided no evidence to show the accused products are dynamically stable. Thus, \n2 I proposed this construction prior to oral argument. (D.I. 142). \n7 Defendants argue there is no genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment that \nthe accused products do not infringe claims 1-15 of the '65 9 Patent. \nDefendants contend that the only evidence Plaintiff has that shows Defendants ' products \nare dynamically stable are \"eigenvalue \" analyses of some of the accused products. (D .I. 83 at 31 ). \nThe parties agree that this type of analysis can be used to assess whether a watercraft is \ndynamically stable. (D.I. 83 at 31; D.I. 91 at 43). \"If an eigenvalue analysis reports a positive \n'sigma value,' it indicates that [a watercraft] is unstable.\" (DJ. 83 at 3). Defendants assert, because \n\"[a]ll of Mr. Barry's eigenvalue analyses for [Defendants '] products report positive sigma values,\" \nPlaintiffs own expert shows conclusively that Defendants ' products do not have dynamic stability. \n(D.I. 83 at 32). \nPlaintiff argues that Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment because there still \nexists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants ' products are dynamically stable. \nPlaintiff cites to Mr. Barry's deposition where he testified that he did not believe his analyses \nshowed the products were dynamically unstable. (D.I. 91 at 44). Plaintiff contends that: (1) while \nMr. Barry's eigenvalue analysis showed the watercrafts to be dynamically unstable, the results \nwere \"close\" to showing dynamic stability, and (2) when Mr. Barry viewed the accused products \noperating in the real world, he concluded that they were dynamically stable, notwithstanding the \neigenvalue analysis. (Id; see D.I. 85-1, Ex. 6, 402:8-403 :23 (stating positive eigenvalues did not \nindicate dynamic instability in part because the software was \"an approximation \" and did not \naccount for all effects)). Plaintiff, therefore, argues that the eigenvalue analysis is not conclusive \nwhen considering Mr. Barry's testimony and other analyses. \nPlaintiff also relies on Mr. Barry's statements that the Athena Vortex Lattice ( A VL) \nsoftware he used to analyze the stability of the watercrafts understated the stability of the accused \n8 products.3 Mr. Barry stated that the A VL software does not account for additional stabilizing \nfactors that \"exist once the effect of the water in which the hydrofoil is operating in is considered ,\" \nsuch as \"damping, free surface, added mass, and viscosity\". (D.I. 91 at 44; see, e.g., D.I. 80-33, \nEx. 31, ,r,r 23 (free surface), 55 (damping, added mass and viscosity effects)). Therefore , Plaintiff \ncontends that Mr. Barry's testimony about his different analyses and his conclusions raises a \ngenuine dispute as to whether the accused products are dynamically stable. \nI agree with Plaintiff that there is a genuine dispute whether the accused products are \ndynamically stable. Defendants are correct that the eigenvalue analyses of the watercrafts show at \nleast one positive sigma value for each product analyzed, which Plaintiff does not dispute, \nindicating dynamic instability. Those analyses, however, are not the only evidence in the record. \nThe record also includes testimony by Mr. Barry, in which he concludes that the watercraft are \ndynamically stable based on analyzing the stability derivatives using the A VL software and \nobservation of the watercraft in the real world. (D.I. 91 at 44; see, e.g., D.I. 80-33, ,r,r 26-28, 53-\n55). Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as I am required to do, I determine \nthat a reasonable jury could conclude that the accused products have dynamic stability and \ntherefore do infringe. \nTherefore , I will deny summary judgment of infringement of claims 1-15 of the '659 \nPatent. \n3 Mr. Barry used the A VL software to analyze the pitch stability derivative , directional stability \nderivative, and roll stability derivative to assess watercraft stability. Mr. Barry also used the \nAVL software to analyze the eigenvalues for his eigenvalue analysis. (See, e.g., D.I. 85-1, Ex. 3, \n,r,r 95-96, 155-156) \n9 B. INFRINGEMENT OF THE '044 PA TENT \nThe parties have cross-moved for summary judgment on infringement of claims 1-22 of \nthe '044 Patent (D.I. 80 at 20-26; D.I. 83 at 29-32). The parties agree that whether either side is \nentitled to summary judgment comes down to whether there is a genuine issue of material fact that \nDefendants infringe claim 1 of the '044 Patent. The claim reads as follows: \n1. A passively stable, weight-shift controlled personal hydrofoil watercraft , \ncompnsmg : \na flotation device that has a fore-aft length greater than a lateral width, the flotation \ndevice having a top surface and a bottom surface, wherein a user can be disposed \non the top surface of the flotation device in a prone, kneeling, or standing position, \nthe flotation device having a forward section, a middle section, and a rear section, \nand the flotation device being controlled via weight shift of the user; \na strut having an upper end and a lower end, the upper end fixedly interconnected \nwith the flotation device between the middle section and the rear section of the \nflotation device; \na hydrofoil fixedly interconnected with the lower end of the strut, the hydrofoil \nhaving no movable surface and designed to provide passive static stability \ncontrolled solely by weight shift of the user; \na propulsion system for propelling the watercraft in a body of water, wherein the \npropulsion system is connected to the hydrofoil ; and \nthe watercraft having no movable steering system. \n('044 Patent, cl. 1). There are two disputes at issue here. First, the parties dispute whether the \npreamble of claim 1 is limiting. Plaintiff argues it is not; Defendants , that it is. Second, the parties \ndispute whether Defendants ' products satisfy the stability limitations of claim 1. Resolving the \nsecond issue necessarily depends on the outcome of the first issue. \n1. Whether the Preamble of Claim 1 is Limiting \nAs an initial matter, it is proper for me to determine whether the preamble of claim 1 is \nlimiting or not. Plaintiff argues that this is a determination to be left for the jury. (D.I. 91 at 41). Plaintiff is mistaken. Determining the effect of preamble language is a claim-construction issue. \nSee Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions AB v. Oticon Medical AB, 958 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. \n2020). Claim construction and resolving the scope of asserted claims are questions of law left to \nthe court. See Every Penny Counts, Inc. v. American Express Co., 563 F.3d 1378, 1383 (citing 02 \nMicro Int'! Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., 521 F.3d 1351, 1361-62 (Fed. Cir. 2008)). \nTherefore, I find it is necessary for me to make this determination now.4 \n\"[A]s a general rule preamble language is not treated as limiting.\" Aspex Eyewear, Inc. v. \nMarchan Eyewear, Inc., 672 F.3d 1335, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2012). \"Whether to treat a preamble as a \nlimitation is 'determined on the facts of each case in light of the overall form of the claim, and the \ninvention as described in the specification and illuminated in the prosecution history.\"' Deere & \nCo. v. Bush Hog, LLC, 703 F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting Applied Materials , Inc. v. \nAdvanced Semiconductor Materials Am., Inc., 98 F.3d 1563, 1572-73 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). \"In \ngeneral, a preamble limits the invention if it recites essential structure or steps, or if it is necessary \nto give life, meaning, and vitality to the claim.\" Catalina Mktg. Int'!, Inc. v. Coo/savings.com , Inc., \n289 F.3d 801, 808 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \"The preamble may be \nlimiting to the extent it is 'necessary to provide antecedent basis for the body of the claim.\"' \nCochlear Bone, 958 F.3d at 1355 (quoting Symantec Corp. v. Computer Assoc. Int'!, Inc., 522 F.3d \n1279, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2008)). In addition, the preamble may be limiting when the preamble \"is \nessential to understand limitations or terms in the claim body,\" recites \"additional structure or steps \nunderscored as important by the specification ,\" or there was \"clear reliance on the preamble during \n4 While I have construed identical preamble language in the context of claim 1 of the '659 Patent \nas limiting, both parties agreed the preamble was limiting in that patent. \n11 prosecution to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art.\" Catalina, 289 F.3d at 808. In \nother words, there are numerous exceptions to the default rule that a preamble is not limiting. \nPlaintiff contends that the preamble is not limiting because there is a presumption against \nreading a preamble as limiting and this case does not present one of the recognized exceptions to \nthat presumption. Specifically , Plaintiff argues that the \"preamble does not: (1) recite essential \nstructure; (2) provide antecedent basis to the claim term at issue; and (3) is not essential to \nunderstand limitations or terms in the claim body.\" (D.I. 91 at 42). \nPlaintiff further argues that there was no reliance on the preamble during prosecution. (Id. \nat 43). Plaintiff cites to the fact the preamble was present in the original claim as filed, and the \nstatic stability limitation was added to overcome prior art. (D.I. 146 at 2). Plaintiff contends that \nthis shows that neither the inventor nor Examiner relied on the preamble during prosecution \nbecause the addition of the static stability limitation would be unnecessary if the preamble were \nlimiting. (Id. at 2). \nDefendants argue the preamble should be limiting because claim 1 of the '659 Patent, \nwhich is part of the same patent family and has an identical specification , recites identical language \nand both parties agree the preamble is limiting in that context. Defendants contend that there is \n\"no technical or legal justification for why identical preambles should be treated differently. \" (D.I. \n83 at 30). Defendants further argue that the preamble \"is limiting because it recites an 'essential' \nelement not found in the body of the claim (i.e., dynamic stability). \" (D.I. 106 at 15). To put it \nanother way, Defendants argue that the patent specification \"repeatedly defines the invention as \nan overall stable watercraft, \" and therefore the preamble should be limiting because only the \npreamble specifies that the invention is dynamically stable. (D.I. 145 at 3). \n12 I agree with Plaintiff that the preamble is not limiting. As an initial matter, I am not aware \nof any case law that states a preamble must be limiting in one patent because the identicall y worded \npreamble is limiting in another patent belonging to the same patent family. Defendants have also \nnot supplied any such case law, despite being given additional time to do so. (D.I. 145 at 1). \nThe proposed identically-worded-preamble rule is inconsistent with the case law.5 The \nFederal Circuit has stated \"[w]hether to treat a preamble as a limitation is determined on the facts \nof each case in light of the overall form of the claim[] and the invention as described in the \nspecification and illuminated in the prosecution history.\" Cochlear Bone, 958 F.3d at 1354 \n(quoting Deere & Co., 703 F.3d at 1357). I am thus required to analyze the form of claim 1 of the \n'044 Patent, which has significant differences from the form of claim 1 of the '659 Patent, when \ndetermining whether the preamble is limiting. Therefore , I do not believe that the presumption \nagainst reading a preamble as non-limiting is overcome just because the same preamble is limiting \nin claim 1 of the '659 Patent. \nI do not find that dynamic stability is an \"essential\" element that requires the preamble to \nbe limiting. Nor do I think dynamic stability is \"underscored as important by the specification. \" \nCatalina, 289 F.3d at 808. Nowhere in the '044 Patent is the term \"dynamic stability\" or \n\"dynamically stable\" used. \nThe '044 Patent specification does repeatedly describe the invention as being \"stable\" or \nhaving \"passive stability,\" and dynamic stability is a component of those terms. See Section III.A. I \n5 Furthermore, I have not applied such a rule even when the claims sharing the identical \npreamble are part of the same patent. See Takeda Pharma. Co. v. Actavis Lab 'ys FL, Inc., 2016 \nWL 3193188, at *6 n.6, *7 n.7, *7-8 (D. Del. June 6, 2016) (independently analyzing whether \nidentical preamble language is limiting in two separate claims of the same patent), aff din part, \nrev 'din part sub nom. Nalproprion Pharms., Inc. v. Actavis Lab 'ys FL, Inc., 934 F.3d 1344 (Fed. \nCir. 2019). \n13 supra. \"But not every preamble reference to additional structure is limiting, even when the \nstructure is noted in the specification--even , indeed, when the structure is 'underscored as \nimportant by the specification.\"' Arctic Cat Inc. v. GEP Power Products, Inc., 919 F.3d 1320, \n1329 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting Catalina, 289 F.3d at 808 (\"[W]hen reciting additional structure or \nsteps underscored as important by the specification , the preamble may operate as a claim \nlimitation.\")). Furthermore , even though the specification references the importance of stability, it \nsimilarly does so with respect to static stability. See '044 Patent 2: 17-20 (\"The prior art in powered \nhydrofoil surfboards have all relied on moveable surfaces for control, and have ignored the \npossibility of designing the hydrofoil for passive static stability.\"); 5:50-54 (\"Note that other \nversions of the hydrofoil are possible: the key is designing the hydrofoil for passive static stability \nvia planform design, airfoil design, and span-wise twist distribution.\"). Therefore , I read the \nspecification as underscoring the importance that the watercraft have static stability. \nThe body of claim 1 of the '044 Patent addresses this essential, static stability element of \nthe invention by reciting \"a hydrofoil ... designed to provide passive static stability.\" ('044 Patent, \ncl. 1 ). Because having static stability is already an explicit limitation in the body of the claim, I do \nnot read the preamble as supplying an essential element for claim 1 of the '044 Patent. 6 \nAccordingly, I conclude that the preamble of claim 1 of the '044 Patent is not limiting. \n6 It is this explicit recitation of static stability in the body of the claim 1 of the '044 Patent that \ndifferentiates the effect of the preamble in claim 1 of the '044 Patent from the effect of the \npreamble in claim 1 of the '659 Patent. The body of claim 1 of the '659 Patent does not contain \nany limitations pertaining to stability. As already discussed , the shared patent specification \nunderscores the importance of the watercraft having static stability. Therefore, the preamble is \nproviding an essential element in claim 1 of the '659 Patent by stating that the watercraft needs \nto be \"stable.\" Since the preamble is limiting, the full scope of \"stable\" becomes a limitation. \n14 2. Non-Infringement of the '044 Patent \nDefendants ' motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the '044 Patent is \npremised on the preamble of claim 1 of the '044 Patent being limiting and requiring the additional \nlimitation of dynamic stability. (D.I. 83 at 29-31). Because I have determined that the preamble to \nclaim 1 is not limiting, there is no dynamic stability limitation in the claims of the '044 Patent. \nTherefore , Defendants ' motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the '044 Patent is \ndenied. \n3. Infringement of the '044 Patent \nPlaintiff moves for summary judgment that Defendants infringe claim 1 of the '044 Patent, \nand, by extension , all other claims of the '044 Patent, on the ground that there is no genuine issue \nof fact that Defendant s' accused products are statically stable. 7 Plaintiff argues that the testimony \nof its expert witness, Mr. Barry, and the analysis he conducted of the accused products, \ndemonstrates that the accused products are passively statically stable. (D.I. 80 at 24-26). Plaintiff \ncontends that because Defendants have not produced any affirmative evidence to dispute that the \naccused products are passively statically stable, there is no disputed fact in the record that prevents \nfinding that the accused products infringe the '044 Patent. (Id. at 25-26). \nDefendants argue, \"There is a genuine dispute as to whether [Plaintiff] has evidence \nsufficient to meet its burden for showing even static stability.\" (D.I. 93 at 25). Defendants contend \nthat their expert witness, Dr. Triantafyllou , has \"explained that in trying to show static stability of \nthe Accused Products, Mr. Barry concocted his own stability standard rather than assess them \naccording to the standard set out in the Asserted Patents.\" (Id. at 26). Defendants further argue, \n7 The parties agree that the only claim limitation in question is whether Defendants ' products \nmeet the stability limitation of claim 1. As discussed above, claim 1 of the '044 Patent only \nrequires static stability because the preamble is not limiting. \n15 \"Without undisputed evidence that the Accused Products meet the standard set out in the Asserted \nPatents-which [Plaintiff] does not have because Mr. Barry did not so opine-summary judgment \nof infringement is improper.\" (Id.). Defendants also argue that summary judgment is improper \nbecause Mr. Barry did not examine all of the accused products for infringement. (Id.). \nI agree with Defendants that there exists a genuine issue of material fact. Plaintiff has \nprovided evidence through Mr. Barry's testimony and analysis to show that Defendants' accused \nproducts are statically stable. Defendants' expert responded by noting that Mr. Barry's analysis \ndeviates from that included in the asserted patents, and the reason for doing so goes unexplained. \n(D.I. 85-1, Ex. 8, 1 17). A reasonable juror could weigh the testimony by the parties' experts and \nreach the conclusion that Plaintiff has not carried its burden to show that Defendants ' products are \nstatically stable. \nTherefore , I will deny summary judgment as to infringement of the '044 Patent. \nC. WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF CLAIMS 16-20 OF THE '659 PATENT \nDefendants move for summary judgment of invalidity for lack of written description for \nclaims 16-20 of the '659 Patent. Claim 16, which is representative of the other claims,8 reads as \nfollows: \n16. A personal hydrofoil watercraft , comprising: \na surfboard-shaped flotation device that has a fore-aft length greater than a lateral \nwidth, the flotation device having a top surface and a bottom surface, wherein the \ntop surface has a substantially horizontal supporting surface configured to support \na user in a prone, kneeling, or standing position, the flotation device having a \nforward section, a middle section, and a rear section; \na hydrofoil interconnected with the surfboard-shaped flotation device, the hydrofoil \nhaving a strut and a first hydrofoil wing, an upper end of the strut being fixedly \ninterconnected with the surfboard-shaped flotation device; \n8 Claims 17-20 are dependent claims that depend on claim 16. \n16 a propulsion system attached to the surfboard-shaped flotation device for \npropelling the watercraft in a body of water, the propulsion system comprising a \nbattery, an electric motor, a motor speed controller, and a propulsor, wherein the \npropulsor is selected from a propeller, a ducted propeller, or a pump-jet, and the \nbattery and motor speed controller are contained in a watertight compartment \nintegrated into the flotation device; \nthe watercraft having no movable steering system; \na handheld controller having a throttle; and \na throttle interface, wherein the throttle is adapted to send electronic signals to the \nthrottle interface that cause an output of the propulsion system to change. \n('659 Patent, cl. 16). Defendants assert the claims are invalid for lack of written description \nbecause they do not contain a stability limitation (i.e., do not require the watercraft to be statically \nstable, dynamically stable, or both), but the specification of the Asserted Patents \"clearly discloses \nthe alleged invention as being a stable hydrofoil watercraft , and never suggests that the alleged \ninvention can be anything other than stable.\" (D.I. 83 at 26). Defendants further contend that the \nfile history of the '044 Patent shows the patent examiner \"explicitly relied on the hydrofoil \nproviding static stability in allowing the '044 [P]atent.\" (Id.). Defendants analogize the present \ncase to ICU Medical, Inc. v. Alaris Medical Sys., Inc., 558 F.3d 1368, 1377-79 (Fed. Cir. 2009). \nPlaintiff does not dispute that neither static stability nor dynamic stability ( or both together) \nare limitations of the claims 16-20 of the '659 Patent. Plaintiff asserts the written description \nrequirement is met because the patent specification does not limit the invention to a \"stable\" \nwatercraft. Plaintiff analogizes the present case to ScriptPro LLC v. Innovation Assoc., Inc., 833 \nF.3d 1336, 1340-42 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Plaintiff argues that a stable watercraft is just one purpose of \nthe invention and claims 16-20 of the '659 Patent are written to address other purposes of the \ninvention, such as not having a movable steering system, providing a \"surfing feel,\" and being \neasy to transport and maintain. (D.I. 91 at 39). \n17 The written description requirement contained in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 requires that the \nspecification \"clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [the inventor] \ninvented what is claimed.\" Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 598 F.3d 1336, 1351 (Fed. Cir. \n2010) (en bane) (alteration in original). \"In other words, the test for sufficiency is whether the \ndisclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the \ninventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.\" Id. \"When determining \nwhether a specification contains adequate written description , one must make an 'objective inquiry \ninto the four corners of the specification from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in the \nart.\"' Bos. Sci. Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson, 64 7 F .3d 1353, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ( quoting Ariad, \n598 F.3d at 1351). \nThe written description inquiry is a question of fact. Ariad, 598 F.3d at 1351. Although it \nis a question of fact, \"[ c ]ompliance with the written description requirement ... is amenable to \nsummary judgment in cases where no reasonable fact finder could return a verdict for the non\u00ad\nmoving party.\" PowerOasis , Inc. v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 522 F.3d 1299, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \"A \nparty must prove invalidity for lack of written description by clear and convincing evidence. \" \nVasudevan S9ftware , Inc. v. MicroStrategy , Inc., 782 F.3d 671, 682 (Fed. Cir. 2015). \nI find that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment that claims 16-20 of the '659 \nPatent are invalid for lack of written description. The patent specification does not disclose that \nthe patentee possessed a personal hydrofoil watercraft that lacks both static and dynamic stability. \nThere is no genuine disputed fact about this. \nThe specification of the '659 Patent only, and repeatedly , describes the invention as being \na watercraft that is either stable or at least has static stability. For example, the abstract of the patent \nrecites, \"A passively stable personal hydrofoil watercraft .... \" ('659 Patent at Abstract). The \n18 patent specification further recites, \"The hydrofoil of the present invention has been designed to \nprovide passive stability in the longitudinal direction , making traditional altitude control systems \nbased on moveable surfaces unnecessary. \" (Id. at col. 2:8-12). \nStatic stability distinguishes the invention from the prior art. The specification recites, \"The \nprior art in powered hydrofoil surfboards have all relied on moveable surfaces for control, and \nhave ignored the possibility of designing the hydrofoil for passive static stability .... [T]he present \ninvention is specifically designed to achieve desired levels of stability and controllability without \nthe need for moveable surfaces.\" (Id. at col. 2:20-26). The patent specification further emphasizes \nthat the hydrofoil should be designed to provide static stability to the watercraft , even for \nundisclosed embodiments . (Id. at col. 5 :62-65 (\"Note that other versions of the hydrofoil are \npossible: the key is designing the hydrofoil for passive static stability via planform design, airfoil \ndesign, and span-wise twist distribution. \")). The patent specification attributes the ability to be \ncontrolled by weight shift to the stability of the watercraft. The specification states, \"This invention \nexploits passive stability to obviate the necessity for mechanisms or active control systems to \nprovide stability. This passive stability allows the watercraft to be controlled by weight shift rather \nthan by mechanical systems.\" (Id. at col. 6:7-11). There is nothing in the patent specification to \nsuggest that a watercraft that is both statically and dynamically unstable is part of the disclosure . \nSee LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Resource Mapping , Inc., 424 F.3d 1336, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2005). \nI agree with Defendants that the present case is similar to ICU Medical. In ICU Medical, \nthe patent at issue claimed medical valves with spikes and without spikes (i.e., valves without the \nspike limitation) . The specification of the patent, however, only described \"medical valves with \nspikes.\" Id. at 1378. The Federal Circuit upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment \n19 that the \"spikeless \" claims were invalid for lack of written description because a POSA would not \nhave understood the patentee to have invented a \"spikeless\" medical valve. Id. at 13 78-79. \nSimilarly , in the present case, the '659 Patent only discusses a watercraft that is at least \nstatically stable. There is nothing in the specification that would signal to a POSA that the patentee \ninvented a watercraft that is statically unstable. Furthermore, at oral argument , Plaintiff failed to \npoint to any disclosure in the patent specification of a description or embodiment of a watercraft \nthat was not at least statically stable. (D.I. 147 at 73:9-23). See ICU Medical, 558 F.3d at 1379. \nWhile Plaintiff argues that this case is more analogous to ScriptPro LLC v. Innovation \nAssoc., Inc., 833 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2016), I disagree. In ScriptPro , the Federal Circuit reversed \nthe district court's ruling that claims without a limitation of employing a \"sorting and storage \nscheme based on patient-identifying information\" were invalid for lack of written description . Id. \nat 1341.The Federal Circuit noted that while the patent specification \"focuses on embodiments \nemploying a sorting and storage scheme based on patient-identifying information ,\" it is not a \nlimitation of the invention because the invention is used to solve many problems , not all of which \ninvolve using a scheme based on patient-identifying information. Id. Specifically , the Federal \nCircuit cautioned that \"a specification 's focus on one particular embodiment or purpose cannot \nlimit the described invention where the specification expressly contemplates other embodiments \nor purposes.\" Id. at 1341. \nPlaintiffs arguments that watercraft stability is just one solution the invention addresses , \nlike the scheme in ScriptPro, misses the mark. First, in ScriptPro, the Federal Circuit stated that \nthe \"patent's express disclosure that sorting and storing can be done in a number of ways \ndistinguishes this case from ... ICU Medical.\" Id. Specifically , the Federal Circuit found that the \ninvention was not limited to using a patient-identifying information sorting scheme because the \n20 patent specification disclosed that \"any predetermined storage scheme will do.\" Id. Unlike in \nScriptPro, there is no such express disclosure in the '659 Patent specification that the watercraft \ncan be statically and dynamically unstable. Nor is there anything that could reasonably be \ninterpreted as an implied disclosure. \nSecond, the Federal Circuit noted that the patent in ScriptPro was aimed at addressing \nmultiple problems and that the different claims were directed at \"covering these different aspects \nof the invention.\" Id. at 1342. In this case, however, the patent specification clearly describes static \nstability as a limitation of the invention as a whole, not an aspect of some embodiments or one \npurpose. See p.19 supra. The patent specification is not just describing some embodiments as \nstable or having static stability. (See, e.g., '659 Patent, col. 2:9-12; 2:23-25, 5:62-65). Nor is the \nspecification describing stability as just one purpose of the invention. The patent specification , \ninstead, is emphasizing that it is the stability of the watercraft -or at the least static stability \nprovided by the hydrofoil -that permits the invention to achieve the full scope of its purposes such \nas not having a moveable steering system. (See id. at col. 6:7-11). \nTherefore , I find that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment that claims 16-20 of \nthe '659 Patent are invalid for lack of written description . \nD. ANTICIPATION OF THE '044 PATENT AND '659 PATENT \nPlaintiff moves for summary judgment on Defendants' counterclaims that the Asserted \nPatents are invalid as anticipated by Plaintiff's products. (D.I. 80 at 26-37; see also D.I. 13 at 13-\n14). Defendants concede that they are not arguing that Plaintiff's own products invalidate the \nAsserted Patents. (D.I. 93 at 27 (\"Waydoo is not asserting that the Asserted Patents are invalid \nover MHL's own products.\")). Therefore , this issue is moot and Plaintiff's motion is dismissed. \n21 Plaintiff also moves for summary judgment on Defendants ' counterclaims that the Asserted \nPatents are invalid as anticipated by the Evolo Report. The Evolo Report is a 554 page report from \n\"a graduate-level student project that was completed in 2009 by naval architecture students at the \nRoyal Institute of Technology in Stockholm , Sweden.\" (D.I. 80 at 26-37). 9 \nThere are two issues to this dispute. \nThe first issue is whether the Evolo Report discloses the static stability limitation of the \nclaims 1-22 of the '044 Patent and claims 1-15 of the '659 Patent.10 Plaintiff argues it does not; \nDefendants argue it does. \nThe second issue is whether the Evolo Report is a printed publication. Plaintiff argues the \nEvolo Report is not because it was not publicly accessible before the priority date of the Asserted \nPatents. Defendants argue there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Evolo Report \nwas publicly accessible. \nI address each issue in turn. \n1. Does the Evolo Report Disclose the Static Stability Limitation? \n\"To show that a patent claim is invalid as anticipated , the accused infringer must show by \nclear and convincing evidence that a single prior art reference discloses each and every element of \na claimed invention. \" Silicon Graphics, Inc. v. AT! Tech., Inc., 607 F.3d 784, 796 (Fed. Cir. 2010). \n\"[E]very element of the claimed invention [must be described] , either expressly or inherently , such \n9 Plaintiff argue that Defendants improperly combine multiple Evolo-related references into one \nanticipation analysis. Defendants argue in their briefing that the Evolo Report itself is the single \nprior art reference that anticipates the Asserted Patents. (D.I. 93 at 30). Therefore , for purposes \nof this motion, I focus only on the Evolo Report. \n10 Plaintiff also argues that claims 16-20 of the '659 Patent are not invalidated by anticipation \nbecause the Evolo Report does not disclose a motor speed controller , but this issue is moot as I \nhave found claims 16-20 of the '659 Patent to be invalid for lack of written description. See \nSection III.C supra. \n22 that a person of ordinary skill in the art could practice the invention without undue \nexperimentation. \" Callaway Golf Co. v. Acushnet Co., 576 F.3d 1331, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2009). As \nwith infringement , the court construes the claims and compares them against the prior art. See \nEnzo Biochem, Inc. v. Applera Corp., 599 F.3d 1325, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2010). \"While anticipation \nis a question of fact, it may be decided on summary judgment if the record reveals no genuine \ndispute of material fact.\" Encyclopaedia Britannica , Inc. v. Alpine Elecs. of Am., Inc., 609 F.3d \n1345, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2010). \nPlaintiff argues that the Evolo Report does not disclose a statically stable watercraft. \nSpecifically, Plaintiff argues that Defendants cannot meet their burden because Dr. Triantafyllou \ndid not mathematically assess the stability of the watercraft disclosed in the Evolo Report. (D.I. 80 \nat 34-35). Plaintiff also cites to Mr. Barry's expert report to show that the Evolo Report discloses \na statically unstable watercraft (Id. at 35-36). \nDefendants argue that there is a material issue of fact as to whether the Evolo Report \ndiscloses a statically stable watercraft because Dr. Triantafyllou concluded that the Evolo Report \ndiscloses a statically stable watercraft. (D.I. 93 at 32 (citing D.I. 85-1, Ex. 7, ,r,r 220-241)). \nDefendants contend that Dr. Triantafyllou responded to the arguments raised by Plaintiffs expert, \nMr. Barry. (D.I. 93 at 32 (citing D.I. 85-1, Ex. 9, ,r,r 71-77)). \nI find there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Evolo Report discloses a \nstatically stable watercraft. Both parties rely on the testimony of their expert witnesses to establish \ntheir positions. A reasonable juror could weigh the testimony by the parties' experts and reach the \nconclusion that Defendants have shown that the Evolo Report discloses a statically stable \nwatercraft. \n23 2. Is the Evolo Report a Printed Publication? \n\"Whether a reference qualifies as a \"printed publication \" under \u00a7 102(b) is a legal \nconclusion based on underlying factual findings.\" Jazz Pharm., Inc. v. Amneal Pharm., LLC, 895 \nF.3d 1347, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \"A reference is considered publicly accessible if it was \ndisseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that persons interested and ordinarily \nskilled in the subject matter or art, exercising reasonable diligence , can locate it.\" Acceleration \nBay, LLC v. Activision Blizzard Inc., 908 F.3d 765, 772 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted). \"The test for public accessibility is not 'has the reference been \nindexed?\"' Id. at 774. Instead, \"the ultimate question is whether the reference was 'available to the \nextent that persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject matter or art[,] exercising \nreasonable diligence , can locate it.\"' Voter Verified, Inc. v. Premier Election Sols., Inc., 698 F.3d \n1374, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting SRI Int'l, Inc. v. Internet Sec. Sys., Inc., 511 F.3d 1186, 1194 \n(Fed. Cir. 2008)). \nPlaintiff argues the Evolo Report was not publicly accessible before the priority date of the \nAsserted Patents. (D.I. 80 at 30-32). Plaintiff specificall y contends that there is no evidence that \nthe Evolo website, which contained a link to the Evolo Report, was indexed by Google, would tum \nup on a Google search in 2013, or was otherwise accessible to a POSA before the Asserted Patents' \npriority date. (D.I. 32). \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment because there is \nevidence that the Evolo Report was publicly accessible before the Asserted Patents ' priority date. \nTherefore , there is a disputed material of fact, making summary judgment inappropriate. \nDefendants argue that the record contains evidence that the Evolo Report was downloaded in the \nUnited States before the priority date of the Asserted Patents; that their expert Mr. Lanterman \n24 concluded that the Evolo website was likely indexed by Google and had regular activity, and that \nan article published in the Swedish magazine Batnytt (\"Boat News\") in August 2009 detailed the \nEvolo project and contained a link to the Evolo website. (D.I. 93 at 28-30). \nI find there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Evolo Report was publicly \naccessible to a POSA prior to October 2013. Plaintiff concedes that there was at least one user in \nthe United States ( or at least outside of Sweden and Switzerland) who downloaded the Evolo \nReport. (D.I. 80 at 16, n.7). Further, the article in Batnytt may also have served as a publicly \naccessible \"research aid\" that would have led a POSA to the Evolo website, which contained the \nEvolo Report. See, e.g., Blue Calypso, LLCv. Groupon, Inc., 815 F.3d 1331, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016); \nBruckelmyer v. Ground Heaters, Inc., 445 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2006). For these reasons, I \nfind a reasonable jury could determine that the Evolo Report was publicly accessible before the \nAsserted Patents' priority date. \nTherefore , I find Plaintiff 1s not entitled to summary judgment on Defendants ' \ncounterclaims that the Asserted Patents are anticipated by the Evolo Report. \nE. PLAINTIFF'S STANDING \nPlaintiff moved for summary judgment on Defendants ' affirmative defense that Plaintiff \nlacks standing. (D.I. 79). After oral argument , Defendants stated they are not challenging standing. \n(DJ. 145). \nTherefore , I will dismiss Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on standing as moot. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I deny Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment for \ninfringement of the '044 Patent, deny Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment for the Asserted \n25 Patents not being invalid as anticipated by the Evolo Report, and dismiss Plaintiff's motion for \nsummary judgment on Defendants ' lack of standing argument. \nI deny Defendants ' motion for summary judgment for non-infringement of the '044 Patent \nand '659 Patent and grant Defendants ' motion for summary judgment of invalidity for lack of \nwritten description for claims 16-20 of the '659 Patent. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n26 "}
