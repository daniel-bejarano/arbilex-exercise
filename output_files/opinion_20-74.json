{"case_name": "USA v. Copeland", "case_number": "20-74", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "12-10-2021", "ocr_text": "1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ,  \n       \n v.       \n      \nDARIN COPELAND,  \n \nDefendant.    Criminal Action No. 20- 74-RGA  \n  \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \n \n In connection with the suppression motion (D.I. 28), we had two days of testimony and \nargument after the second day\u2019s testimony. \n I made tentative findings of fact after the first day\u2019s testimony  (D.I. 50 at 91:16\u201392:25) , \nwhich I adopted as final findings of fact after the second day\u2019s testimony. (Nov. 19, 2021 Tr. at \n166:14\u2013167:13).  \n The only live issues by the end of the hearing were whether the search of Defendant\u2019s \nperson and fanny pack were permissible as searches incident to arrest.  I conclude that they were.  \n Both searches took place at the hospital, where Defendant had been tak en (pursuant to \npolicy) for treatment in light of his having been bitten by a police canine. (D.I. 50 at 92:6\u20138, 11\u2013\n18).  Most of the time between his arrest by the side of Route 13\u2014a major roadway in New \nCastle County \u2014was taken up with his transport from that location to the hospital. (Id. at 92:4\u2013\n11, 22\u201325).  I do not find the lapse in time \u2014about fifteen minutes \u2014be tween when he was first \narrested  and when he was searched at the hospital to have rendered the searches as not being \nincident to arrest. See  United States v. Edwards , 415 U.S. 800, 803\u201305 (1974)  (\u201c[R]easonable \ndelay in effectuating [a search incident to arrest] does not change the fact that [Defendant]  was \nno more imposed upon than he could have been at the time and place of the arrest or immed iately 2 \n upon arrival at the place of detention. \u201d).  T he fifteen -minute delay between Defendant\u2019s arrest \nand the search was reasonable considering the location of the  arrest and the concerns to \nDefendant\u2019s health and safety.   \n Once it is determined that the searches were searches incident to arrest, there can be no \nfurther argument about the search of Defendant\u2019s person, which recovered a key and some bags \nof suspected heroin. (D.I. 50 at 92:16 \u201318).  Defendant argues that the search of the fanny pack, \nwhich recovered additional bags of suspected heroin and a bag of suspected crack  cocaine  (id. at \n92:19\u201322) , was not incident to arrest, but it is undisputed that the fanny pack was strapped to \nDefendant\u2019s  chest at the time of the se arch. (Id. at 52:19\u201320, 54:13\u201318, 55:1\u201310; Nov. 19, 2021 \nTr. at 166:16\u201321); s ee Curd v. City Ct. of Judsonia, 141 F.3d 839, 843 (8th Cir. 1998)  \n(\u201c[S]earches of the person and articles \u2018 immediately associated with the person of the arrestee, \u2019 \nare measured with a different, more flexible constitutional time clock .\u201d).   \nIt is true that Defendant was handcuffed and in police custody at the time of the search . \n(D.I. 50 at  50:25\u201351:2).  The search incident to arrest doctrine is concerned with preventing \naccess to weapons and destruction of evidence.  Such concerns remain even for a handcuffed person in police custody.  See United States v. Shakir , 616 F.3d 315, 320\u201321 (3d Cir. 2010).\n1  In \naddition, the concerns are heightened when the arrestee is about to interact with medical personnel for possible treatment  for injuries.  Thus, I find the search incident to arrest doctrine \njustified the searches.  \n \n1 Defendant cites United States v. Davis , 997 F.3d 191 (4th Cir. 2021), in support of his \nargument.  I note that factually, Shakir  is closer to the instant case.  In terms of analysis, I note \nthat Davis  seems to give greater weight to the handcuffed status of the defendant than Shakir  did.  \nHere, unlike Davis  and like Shakir, there was reason to believe at the time of the search that \nDefendant could access the fanny pack, as it was on his person.     3 \n    Defendant argued that there was no  evidence about what kind of search, if any, was \ndone of Defendant when he was by the side of Route 13.  I think Defendant is right  that there is \nno direct evidence, but the circumstantial evidence strongly indicates that, at most, he was patted \ndown for w eapons.  The fact that he had suspected heroin on his person and suspected heroin and \ncrack cocaine in his fanny pack convinces me that he was not searched incident to arrest (as opposed to patted down for weapons) at Route 13, because the police could har dly have missed \nall of the heroin and cocaine if a search had been conducted.\n2  Thus, I find that he was not \nsearched incident to arrest by the side of the road.  But, even if he had been, the search es Officer \nPhelps performed  at the hospital  would have been justified as searches incident to arrest.  \n Thus, for the above reasons, the suppression motion (D.I. 28) is DENIED. \n \n       /s/ Richard G. Andrews ____ \n       United States District Judge  \n \n2 At the second hearing, I s tated, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has proved that [Defendant]  was or was \nnot searched by the side of the  road.\u201d  (Nov. 19, 2021 Tr. at 167:9\u201310).  I made this conclusion \nbased on the absence of direct evidence.  Now that I have considered the entire record and \nthought about the circumstantial evidence, it is clear to me  (and I so find)  that Defendant was not \nsearched by the side of the road.  "}
