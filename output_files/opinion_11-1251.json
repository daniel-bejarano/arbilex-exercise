Civil Action No. 11-1251-CFC \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nTiffani D. Hurst, Esquire, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Counsel for Petitioner. \nKathryn Joy Garrison, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, \nWilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Respondents. \nMarch 31, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware Presently pending before the Court is an Amended Petition for a Writ of Habeas \nCorpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 filed by Petitioner Milton Taylor. (D.I. 67) The \nState filed an Answer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 72; D.I. 85) \nAs ordered by the Court, the Parties filed supplemental briefing on whether the post-\n2014 versions of Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(d)(2) and (i)(2) constitute \nindependent and adequate state procedural rules for procedural default purposes . (D. I. \n86; D.I. 89; D.I. 90) For the reasons discussed , the Court will deny the Petition. \nBACKGROUND \nOn the morning of March 23, 2000, Steven Butler (\"Butler\"), a \nmaintenance worker at the Compton Townhouse complex in \nWilmington, was awaiting the arrival of some contractors \nwhen he discovered two unattended children playing in the \ncourtyard. He recognized the children, ages two and four, as \nthose belonging to [Theresa] Williams. Before he left to \nsupervise the contractors, Butler instructed the children to \nstay away from the street until their mother came outside to \njoin them. \nWilliams and her sister, Tawana Ricks (\"Ricks\"), previously \nplanned to do some shopping together that morning, but \nWilliams never arrived at the predetermined location. When \nRicks could not reach her sister by telephone she decided to \nvisit Williams' home. Ricks arrived at the Compton \nTownhouse complex and discovered her sister's two youngest \nchildren, unsupervised and playing in the vicinity of her sister's \nhome. As Ricks was knocking on the locked door to Williams' \nhome, Nathaniel Henry (\"Henry\"), Williams' uncle, arrived to \ndeliver some furniture. Ricks and Henry grew increasingly \nconcerned as their attempts to locate Williams failed. \nButler then joined Ricks and Henry. Upon Ricks' urging, Butler \nagreed to open Williams' door. Once inside, Butler and Henry \ndiscovered Williams' badly beaten and bloody body concealed \nbeneath a blanket with a bicycle on top. Williams was bleeding \nfrom her nose and had a cord wrapped around her neck. \nWilliams was not breathing and Butler called 911. Williams was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy later \nrevealed that Williams was strangled, beaten and cut. The \nautopsy also revealed that Williams was pregnant, and that \nthe baby died as a result of Williams' death. \n[Petitioner] was identified as a suspect in the murder when \npolice learned that he had a relationship with Williams and that \nhe had been seen in the vicinity of her home on the morning \nof March 23, 2000. On March 25, 2000 the police received a \ntip that [Petitioner] was standing at a pay phone on the corner \nof 9th and Madison Streets. The police responded to the tip \nand placed [Petitioner] under arrest. Although the arresting \nofficers were aware that [Petitioner] was wanted for \nquestioning in regard to Williams' murder, the purpose for the \narrest was an outstanding bench warrant. \nAt the police station, [Petitioner] was taken to an interview \nroom where Officer Ronald Muniz (\"Muniz\") began routine \ninventory procedures. Muniz removed a folded piece of paper \nfrom the front pocket of [Petitioner's] hooded sweatshirt and \nplaced it on the table. Shortly thereafter, Detective James \nDiana (\"Diana\") entered the room, picked up the piece of \npaper, opened it and began to read it. He quickly realized that \nthe paper contained a handwritten confession (the \n\"Confession Letter\") and therefore removed the letter from the \nother inventoried items so that it could be included as \nevidence. \n*** \nThe confession read in pertinent part: My name is [Petitioner], \nI was born on 11-15-68, my Social Security number is XXX\u00ad\nXX-XXXX. I am wanted by the Wilmington police for the \nmurder of Theresa Irene Williams a.k.a. Treety. I confess that \nI did kill Treaty and left Terrel and her daughter outside \nbecause I couldn't hurt either one of them. After I strangled \nher I stuck a long kitchen knife in her mouth and cut something \nin her throat. \n*** \n[The parties stipulated that [Petitioner] wrote the Confession \nLetter.] The Confession Letter provided the basis for a search \nwarrant for the Victim's car which was found parked on a \nstreet in New Castle. Inside the car the police found a \n2 thirteen-inch knife wrapped in a bloodstained tee shirt. The \nblood on the shirt matched the Victim's blood type. During the \ninvestigation it became clear that the apparent motive for the \nmurder was that [Petitioner's] current girlfriend had given him \nan ultimatum: end all contact with Williams or lose the current \ngirlfriend. Taylor had apparently gone to see Williams to end \ncontact with her and killed her in the process. \nTaylorv. State, 822 A.2d 1052, 1054-55 (Del. 2003). \nOn April 24, 2000, a New Castle County grand jury indicted Petitioner for first \ndegree murder. (D.I. 72 at 1) Petitioner filed a motion to suppress Petitioner's \nstatement that he made in the \"turnkey\" area of the police department prior to his \nvideotaped police statement and his handwritten confession letter that the police \ndiscovered during an inventory search of his belongings once in custody at the \ndepartment. (D.I. 41-46 at 1-2) The Superior Court denied the suppression motion \nafter a conducting an evidentiary hearing and reviewing briefing submitted by both \nparties. (D.I. 41-4) Following a three-day trial, a Superior Court jury found Petitioner \nguilty of first degree murder. The Superior Court held a two-day penalty hearing and \nsentenced him to death. (Id. at 1-2) Petitioner appealed, and the Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed his conviction and sentence. See Taylor, 822 A.2d at 1058. \nIn December 2003, the Superior Court appointed two conflict counsel (\"first Rule \n61 counsel\") to represent Petitioner during his post-conviction proceedings. (D.I. 72 at \n2) In March 2006, Petitioner filed an motion for postconviction relief pursuant to \nDelaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61. (D.I. 73-1 at 22, Entry No. 144) The State \nanswered the amended Rule 61 motion in June 2005. (D.I. 73-1 at 23, Entry No. 161) \nIn December 2006 and January 2007, the Superior Court held 11 days of evidentiary \nhearings, and then held an additional 2 days of evidentiary hearings in March 2007. \n3 (D.I. 73-1 at 25-26, Entry Nos. 181 and 187) Petitioner filed a Memorandum in Support \nof his Rule 61 motion (\"first Rule 61 motion\") in September 2009. (D.I. 73-3) The State \nfiled an answer to the first Rule 61 motion in January 2010 (D.I. 73-5), and Petitioner \nfiled a reply in March 2010 (D.1. 73-6). The Superior Court denied Petitioner's first Rule \n61 motion on August 6, 2010. See State v. Taylor, 2010 WL 3511272 (Del. Super. Ct. \nAug. 6, 2010). The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on October 25, \n2011. See Taylor v. State, 32 A.3d 37 4, 391 (Del. 2011 ). \nIn 2012, now represented by the federal public defender's office, Petitioner filed \nin this Court a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. (D.I. 11) \nHe filed an amended petition in June 2013, to which the State filed an answer in August \n2013. (D.I. 34; D.I. 39) In April 2014, the case was stayed pending Petitioner's \nexhaustion of claims to be presented to the Delaware state courts in a second Rule 61 \nproceeding. (D.I. 46) \nOn September 9, 2016, the Delaware Superior Court stayed Petitioner's second \nRule 61 proceeding pending the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Powell v. State, \n153 A.3d 69 (Del. 2016) regarding the retroactivity of its ruling in Rauf v. State, 145 A.3d \n430 (Del. 2016) that Delaware's capital sentencing procedure was unconstitutional. \n(D.I. 73-1 at 41-42, Entry No. 271) On April 28, 2017, following the rulings in Powell \nand Rauf, the Superior Court vacated Petitioner's death sentence and resentenced him \nto life imprisonment without the benefit of parole. (D.I. 73-1 at 44, Entry No. 282) \nPetitioner did not appeal his resentencing. \nIn July 2017, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court a motion to reduce his \nsentence pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 35, arguing that he should \n4 have been resentenced pursuant to the class A felony statute, 11 Del. Code \u00a7 4205 \n(2003). (D.I. 73-1 at 45, Entry No. 288) The Superior Court denied the Rule 35 motion \nin August 2017 (D.I. 73-1 at 46, Entry No. 293), and the Delaware Supreme Court \naffirmed that decision. See Taylor v. State, 2018 WL 121021 (Del. Mar. 7, 2018). \nOn August 25, 2017, Petitioner filed an amended second Rule 61 motion \n(\"second Rule 61 motion\"). (D.I. 73-1 at 46, Entry No. 294) The Superior Court denied \nthe second Rule 61 motion as procedurally barred, and the Delaware Supreme Court \naffirmed that decision on February 27, 2019. See State v. Taylor, 2018 WL 3199537 \n(Del. Super. Ct. June 28, 2018); Taylor v. State, 206 A.3d 825 (Table), 2019 WL 990718 \n(Del. Feb. 27, 2019). \nIn March 2019, Petitioner filed a motion to lift the stay on the instant proceedings, \nalong with a proposed stipulated briefing schedule. (D.I. 56; D.I. 57) In June 2019, \nPetitioner filed a second amended habeas petition, to which the State filed an objection. \n(D.I. 62; D.I. 63) The Court lifted the stay, accepted the State's objections, and ordered \nPetitioner to file an amended petition that included caselaw to support the arguments \nasserted therein. (D.I. 66) In December 2019, Petitioner filed a second amended \npetition (\"Petition\"). (D.I. 67) The State filed an Answer, to which Petitioner filed a \nReply. (D.I. 72; D.I. 85) In September 2021, the Court ordered the Parties to file \nsupplemental briefing concerning the effect, if any, the Delaware Supreme Court's \nrecent decision in Purnell v. State, 254 A.3d 1053 (Del. 2012) has on the determination \nas to whether the post-2014 version of Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rules 61(d) \nand 61(i)(2) constituted independent and adequate state procedural rules under the \nfederal habeas procedural default doctrine. (D.I. 86) The State filed its Supplemental \n5 Answer on December 22, 2021 (D.I. 89) and Petitioner field his Supplemental Reply on \nDecember 27, 2021 (D.I. 90). \nGOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES \nI. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\"AEDPA\") \"to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences .. \n. and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\" Woodford v. Garceau, \n538 U.S. 202,206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas \npetition filed by a state prisoner only \"on the ground that he is in custody in violation of \nthe Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). \nAdditionally, AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for analyzing the \nmerits of a habeas petition in order to \"prevent federal habeas 'retrials' and to ensure \nthat state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\" Bell v. \nCone, 535 U.S. 685,693 (2002). \nII. Exhaustion and Procedural Default \nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief \nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. \nConnor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971 ). AEDPA states in pertinent part: \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a \nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court \nshall not be granted unless it appears that -\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the \ncourts of the State; or \n6 (B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective \nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such process \nineffective to protect the rights of the applicant. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of comity, \ngives \"state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking \none complete round of the State's established appellate review process.\" O'Sullivan, \n526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werls v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). \nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the \nhabeas claims were \"fairly presented\" to the state's highest court, either on direct \nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court \nto consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447,451 n.3 (2005); \nCastille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised the issue on direct \nappeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted and the petitioner does \nnot need to raise the same issue again in a state post-conviction proceeding. See \nLambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997). \nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and further \nstate court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the federal \ncourt will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted. See \nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \"meet\u008f the \ntechnical requirements for exhaustion\" because state remedies are no longer available); \nsee also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims, however, are \nprocedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, \n160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state's \n7 highest court, but that court \"clearly and expressly\" refuses to review the merits of the \nclaim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted \nbut procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. \n255, 260-64 (1989). \nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims \nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual \nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if \nthe court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255,260 \n(3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause for a procedural \ndefault, a petitioner must show that \"some objective factor external to the defense \nimpeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.\" Murray v. Carrier, \n477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show that \nthe errors during his trial created more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that \nthe errors worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial \nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\" Id. at 494. \nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \"constitutional violation has \nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, \"1 then a federal court \ncan excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a \nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446,451 \n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F .3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001 ). The miscarriage of justice \nexception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means factual \ninnocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 \n1Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. \n8 (1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual innocence by asserting \n\"new reliable evidence-whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy \neyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence-that was not presented at trial,\" \nshowing that no reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a \nreasonable doubt. See Hubbard v. Pinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004). \nIll. Standard of Review \nIf a state's highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the \nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if \nthe state court's decision was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, \nclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates,\" or the state court's decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts \nbased on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see Williams \nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,412 (2000); Appel v. Hom, 250 F.3d 203,210 (3d Cir. 2001). A \nclaim has been \"adjudicated on the merits\" for the purposes of\u00a7 2254(d) if the state \ncourt decision finally resolved the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a \nprocedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Hom, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. \n2009). The deferential standard of\u00a7 2254(d) applies even \"when a state court's order is \nunaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\" \nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \"it \nmay be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the \nabsence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\" Id. at 99. \nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the \n9 state court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See\u00a7 2254(e)(1). This \npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is \nonly rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See\u00a7 2254(e)(1); \nCampbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280,286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. \n322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in\u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies \nto factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of\u00a7 2254(d)(2) \napplies to factual decisions). \nDISCUSSION \nPetitioner asserts four Claims2 in his timely-filed Petition: (1) trial counsel \nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to (a) present a defense of extreme emotional \ndistress (\"EEO\"); (b) retain a forensic pathologist; (c) object to evidence of the victim's \npregnancy; (d) adequately litigate the motion to suppress Petitioner's confession note; \n(e) object that the death qualification process utilized in his case created a jury that was \nbiased and violated his right to a fair and impartial jury, along with an independent claim \nthat the jury was biased; and (f) object when the State engaged in prosecutorial \nmisconduct, along with an independent claim that the State engaged in prosecutorial \nmisconduct; (2) appellate and post-conviction counsel provided ineffective assistance; \n(3) the cumulative effect of each alleged error deprived Petitioner of a fair trial; and (4) \nthe Delaware Supreme Court violated several constitutional rights of Petitioner by failing \nto resentence him pursuant to 11 Del. Code \u00a7 4205 instead of\u00a7 4209, and his sentence \n2Petitioner actually presented his biased jury and prosecutorial misconduct claims as \nindependent claims and as part of his overall ineffective assistance of counsel claim. \nFor ease of analysis, the Court has included its discussion of the substantive \nindependent claims in its discussion of the related ineffective assistance of counsel \nargument. \n10 to life without parole under \u00a7 4209 violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \nI. Claims Adjudicated on the Merits by Delaware State Courts \nPetitioner presented Claim One (A) (ineffective assistance of trial counsel with \nrespect to EEO defense) to the Delaware Supreme Court on appeal of the Superior \nCourt's denial of his first Rule 61 motion. Petitioner presented Claim Four (challenging \nhis resentencing under \u00a7 4209) to the Delaware Supreme Court on appeal of the denial \nof his Rule 35 motion for reduction of sentence. The Delaware Supreme Court denied \nboth arguments as meritless. Therefore, these two Claims will warrant relief only if the \nDelaware Supreme Court's decisions were either contrary to, or an unreasonable \napplication of, clearly established federal law. \nA. Claim One (A): Ineffective Assistance of Counsel for Not \nPresenting EED Defense \nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective \nassistance of counsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland v. \nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 \n(2003). Under the first Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \"counsel's \nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" with \nreasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel \nrendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second Strickland prong, \na petitioner must demonstrate that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for \ncounsel's error the result would have been different.\" Id. at 687-96. A reasonable \nprobability is a \"probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id. at \n688. A court many deny an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by only deciding one \n11 of the Strickland prongs. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. \nIn order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must \nmake concrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk summary \ndismissal. See Wells v. Petsock, 941 F .2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991 ); Dooley v. \nPetsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1987). Although not insurmountable, the \nStrickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a \"strong presumption that the \nrepresentation was professionally reasonable.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. \nIn Claim One (A), Petitioner asserts that trial counsel provided ineffective \nassistance by failing to investigate and present the defense of extreme emotional \ndistress at trial. (D.I. 67 at 28-44) According to Petitioner, trial counsel failed to \"consult \nwith an expert regarding the possibility of an extreme emotional distress defense,\" and \n\"reasonably competent counsel would have made this determination and retained an \nexpert to explore the viability of an EED defense months before trial.\" (D.I. 67 at 28-29) \nMore specifically, he asserts: \nHad counsel conducted an adequate investigation, they would \nhave learned of evidence supporting an EED defense which \ncould have been presented to the jury. Dr. Jonathan H. Mack, \na neuropsychologist, and Dr. Edward J. Dougherty, a forensic \npsychologist, both evaluated [Petitioner] during his initial Rule \n61 proceedings and concluded that [Petitioner] was acting \nunder extreme emotional distress at the time of Ms. Williams's \ndeath. [Petitioner's] jury, however, never heard this evidence. \nNor did it hear the roots of that distress -that at the time of \nher death, [Petitioner] believed that Ms. Williams had been \nwith another man and that she was leaving him. In fact, \nJoseph (Jay) Williams, Jr., the father of one of Ms. Williams's \nchildren, stated that Ms. Williams had told him she planned to \nend her relationship with [Petitioner] on the morning of March \n23, 2000, and instead planned to be with him. This outright \nrejection and abandonment triggered overwhelming feelings \nof fear and controllable anger in [Petitioner] that were \n12 connected to the physical and psychological abuse he \nendured as a child, and that [Petitioner's] compromised brain \nwas powerless to control. \n(D.I. 67 at 29-30) \nTo support his contention that trial counsel would have discovered information \nsupporting an EEO defense if they had conducted a more thorough investigation, \nPetitioner has provided declarations from several individuals in his life describing the \nphysical and emotional abuse and parental abandonment they believe he suffered.3 \n(D.I. 67 at 31-53) He asserts that, given his lack of proper treatment, \nthe chronic, severe, psychological and physical abuse [he] \nendured as a child and adolescent created an adult \nhypersensitive and hyperreactive to any perceived threat of \nabandonment or rejection. Those \"explosive\" feelings of \nabandonment and rejection erupted in [Petitioner] the morning \nof Ms. Williams's death, when [Petitioner] believed that Ms. \nWilliams had been with another man and was about to end \n3The Court notes that the information gleaned from the numerous declarations which \nPetitioner presents in this proceeding was not presented to the Delaware state courts in \nPetitioner's first Rule 61 proceeding in 2006-2011, but was presented to the Delaware \nstate courts in his second Rule 61 proceeding in 2017. One of the Claims discussed \nlater in this Opinion alleges that first post-conviction counsel was ineffective for not \ninvestigating further and obtaining this additional background information to be \npresented in the first Rule 61 proceeding. Other evidence presented in Petitioner's \nsecond Rule 61 proceeding but not in his first Rule 61 proceeding also includes a report \nby Dr. Victoria Reynolds, a forensic psychologist, that describes the effects of \nPetitioner's traumatic childhood on his ability to \"self-modulate\" his behavior, and an \naffidavit by Dr. Charles Welti, a medical examiner and forensic pathologist, that was \npresented in order to rebut the trial testimony of the State's medical examiner. See \nTaylor, 2018 WL 3199537, at *7. While Petitioner does not explicitly mention Dr. \nVictoria Reynold's report in this proceeding, he cites to her report (D.I. 59-5) when \nsummarizing the information provided in the numerous affidavits to present Petitioner's \nhistory. (D.I. 67 at 32, 36, 51,53) The Superior Court summarily dismissed Petitioner's \nsecond Rule 61 motion as second or subsequent under Rule 61 (d)(2) after concluding \nthat Petitioner's new evidence did not satisfy the \"actual innocence\" exception to Rule \n61 (d)(2)'s bar because \"actual innocence\" means factual innocence, not legal \ninnocence. Id. at *7-8. \n13 their relationship. As both Dr. Dougherty and Dr. Mack \nconcluded, [Petitioner] was acting under extreme emotional \ndistress at the time of Ms. Williams's death. \nHad trial counsel presented the above evidence [i.e., the \ninformation provided in the numerous declarations] through \nthe testimony of qualified experts, the jury would have learned \nthat [Petitioner] was acting under extreme emotional distress \nat the time of Ms. Williams's death and that the distress was \nreasonably explained by [Petitioner's] belief that Ms. Williams \nwas abandoning him as well as by his history of neglect and \nabuse and resulting psychiatric difficulties. There was no \nreasonable strategic reason for trial counsel's failure to \ninvestigate and present such evidence at trial when trial \ncounsel admittedly knew that pursuing an EED defense was \nin Petitioner's best interest. Trial counsel's failure to do so \nwas prejudicial, and there was a reasonable probability that, \nhad counsel done so, the jury would have rejected the charge \nof first degree murder. \n(D.I. 67 at 53-54) \nIn Petitioner's first Rule 61 proceeding, the Superior Court denied Claim One (A) \nafter finding that \"no reasonable juror would have accepted the extreme emotional \ndistress claim presented at the postconviction hearing.\" Taylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at \n*24-25. More specifically, and after noting that Petitioner's original defense team \nretained \"two doctors, a pastoral counselor, and two psycho-forensic investigators\"4 to \nassist in Petitioner's defense, the Superior Court opined: \nEssentially, this argument again boils down to trial counsel's \nalleged failure to investigate. As presented in detail above, \nhowever, most of [Petitioner's] allegations are flatly untrue. \nAgain, trial counsel immediately employed an experienced, \nmasters-level, licensed, social worker to coordinate \n[Petitioner's] psycho-forensic evaluation. They retained three \nmental health experts in different disciplines. An experienced \npsychologist did an initial evaluation shortly after [Petitioner's] \narrest. A less-experienced, but qualified, psychological \n4Taylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at *24. \n14 assessor performed formal testing not long after the initial \nevaluation. Finally, close to trial, a psychiatrist reviewed the \ntest results and further examined [Petitioner]. All the experts \nspoke with [Petitioner] about the murder and they all had \nextreme emotional distress, as well as other defenses and \nmitigators, in mind. \nTrial counsel examined (Petitioner's] Ferris School and \nDivision of Family Services records. Based on the information \nthey gathered, after serious consideration and repeated \nattempts to establish it, trial counsel made the reasonable \ndecision not to pursue an extreme emotional distress defense \nthat was unsupported by their client and the hard evidence. \nFurthermore, the extreme emotional distress defense now \nenvisioned by [Petitioner's] new counsel and his new experts \nis another argument that sits on the defense's fault line. The \nhypothetical extreme emotional distress defense turns on \n[Petitioner's] personal background, including its family \ndynamics. [Petitioner] still appears to be opposed to that \nevidence's use. So, while it is true that counsel could, \ntechnically, attempt to present that defense over [Petitioner's] \nobjection, the idea is impractical, at best. In any event, as \nexplained above, the whole theory is far-fetched. \nHaving presided over the trial and postconviction relief \nhearing, the court rejects the argument that competent \ncounsel should have raised extreme emotional distress on \nbehalf of a client who told them what [Petitioner] said about \nthe murder, including his spotty memory of it, not being \njealous and his being highly intoxicated by his voluntary use \nof drugs and alcohol. That is so, even if counsel found experts \nlike Ors. Dougherty and Mack to make the claim. \nAs presented above, [Petitioner] repeatedly told trial counsel \nthat before he went to Williams's home, he had been drinking \nand using drugs, and he knew Williams was pregnant by \nanother man, but he was not jealous about that. Moreover, \nthere was no claim of a jealous flare-up during the final \nmeeting. [Petitioner] barely remembered the actual murder. \nBy the same token, there is no evidence, whatsoever, that \nWilliams said or did anything that provoked [Petitioner], much \nless was there evidence of a causal relationship between any \nprovocation and the murder. \n15 The fanciful nature of [Petitioner's] extreme emotional distress \nargument is, perhaps, best reflected by the fact that \n[Petitioner], himself, still does not claim extreme emotional \ndistress. No one, including the postconviction relief experts, \nhas explained how counsel could make a convincing extreme \nemotional distress case without [Petitioner's] cooperation. In \nreaching that conclusion, the court is aware that [Petitioner's] \nnew experts see [Petitioner's] inability to recall and testify \nabout how he murdered Williams as proof that he was \nprovoked and under extreme emotional distress. But, again, \neven if there were an explanation, trial counsel cannot be \nfaulted now for not raising the defense, and there was no \nprejudice to [Petitioner] because trial counsel considered but \ndid not try that tack. No reasonable juror would have accepted \nthe extreme emotional distress claim presented at the \npostconviction relief hearing. \nTaylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at *25. Additionally, the Superior Court stated that, \nwhile it may be argued that Ors. Turner, Walsh, and Tavani \ncould possibly have performed more or different tests, or that \ntrial counsel could have retained different doctors, the mere \nfact that [Petitioner's] counsel did not shop around for a \npsychiatrist willing to testify to the presence of more elaborate \nor grave psychological disorders simply does not constitute \nineffective assistance. Trial counsel's hires were objectively \nreasonable, and trial counsel were not required to find \"the \nbest\" psychologists and psychiatrists available. Even if \ncounsel had retained \"the best\" experts, there is no guarantee \nthat the experts would have developed favorable opinions of \n[Petitioner]. \nTaylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at *20. \nThe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's decision, explaining: \n[Petitioner] insists that his trial counsel should have, but did \nnot, consider other avenues of inquiry. The postconviction \nhearing testimony of his trial defense counsel sharply \ncontroverts that claim. Although [Petitioner] instructed his trial \ncounsel to pursue an \"all or nothing actual innocence\" defense \nand present no mitigating evidence, counsel nonetheless \nretained two experts who questioned [Petitioner's] \n16 truthfulness about possible mitigating factors. Trial counsel \nalso strived to \"tease\" out an EED defense for [Petitioner], and \nexplored potential defenses based on mental illness and drug \naddiction. But, the original defense experts did not detect any \nbrain damage to which [Petitioner] now points as \"missed\" \nevidence in mitigation. The trial court also found that the head \ntrauma claims on which [Petitioner's] new experts based their \ndiagnosis were \"largely uncorroborated.\" \n[Petitioner's] new postconviction defense experts, Drs. \nDougherty and Mack, based their opinions on uncorroborated \nstatements [Petitioner] made to them. Expert opinions based \non uncorroborated statements do not automatically render \ntrial counsel's performance deficient. As the Superior Court \nproperly held, trial counsel's mental health investigation and \ntheir mitigation investigation are not rendered inadequate \nmerely because the defendant has now secured the testimony \nof a more favorable mental health expert. \nTaylor, 32 A.3d at 384 (cleaned up). \nWith respect to the first prong of this Court's inquiry under\u00a7 2254(d)(1 ), a \"state \ncourt decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that \ncontradicts the governing law set forth in Supreme Court precedent, or if it confronts a \nset of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme] Court \nand nevertheless arrives at a result different from that reached by the Supreme Court. 11 \nEley v. Erickson, 712 F.3d 837, 846 (3d Cir. 2013). Here, the Delaware courts correctly \nidentified the Strickland standard applicable to the ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaims in this case, and their decisions were not contrary to Strickland. See Williams, \n529 U.S. at 406 (\"[A] run-of-the-mill state-court decision applying the correct legal rule \nfrom [Supreme Court] cases to the facts of a prisoner's case [does] not fit comfortably \nwithin \u00a7 2254(d)(1 )'s 'contrary to' clause.\"). \nThe Court must also determine if the Delaware state courts reasonably applied \n17 the Strickland standard to the facts of Petitioner's case. See Harrington, 562 U.S. at \n105-06. When performing the \"reasonable application\" inquiry, the Court must review \nthe Delaware state court's denial of Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel \nallegations through a \"doubly deferential\" lens. Id. \"[T]he question is not whether \ncounsel's actions were reasonable, [but rather], whether there is any reasonable \nargument that counsel satisfied Strick/ands deferential standard.\" Id. When assessing \nprejudice under Strickland, the question is \"whether it is reasonably likely the result \nwould have been different\" but for counsel's performance, and the \"likelihood of a \ndifferent result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\" Id. And finally, when viewing \na state court's determination that a Strickland claim lacks merit through the lens of \u00a7 \n2254(d), federal habeas relief is precluded \"so long as fairminded jurists could disagree \non the correctness of the state court's decision.\" Id. at 101. \nIt is well-settled that \"strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law \nand facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\" Strickland, 466 \nU.S. at 690. However, defense counsel's strategic choices may still amount to deficient \nperformance where there has been a failure to conduct a reasonable investigation \nbefore deciding on a particular strategy. See id. at 690-91. The Third Circuit has \nelaborated on counsel's duty to make investigations, explaining that \"[c]ounsel can \nmake a strategic decision to halt an avenue of investigation to reach that decision, but \ndecisions not to investigate certain types of evidence cannot be called 'strategic' when \ncounsel fails to seek rudimentary background information.\" Salaam v. Secy of \nPennsylvania Dep't Corrs., 895 F.3d 254,268 (3d Cir. 2018). The Court's \"principal \nconcern in deciding whether [counsel] exercised reasonable professional judgment is ... \n18 whether the investigation supporting counsel's decision not to introduce mitigating \nevidence [here, of Petitioner's EED] was itself reasonable.\" Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 522-\n23. \nIn this case, the Superior Court denied Claim One (A) after concluding that \nPetitioner failed to satisfy both prongs of Strickland: deficient performance and \nprejudice. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's decision after \ndetermining that Petitioner failed to satisfy Strick/ands performance prong and, \ntherefore, stated that it \"need not reach or address the prejudice prong issue under \nStrickland.\" Taylor, 32 A.3d at 385. \nThe Delaware Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply clearly established \nfederal law by only addressing the performance prong of Strickland without considering \nthe issue of prejudice. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. The Court must also determine \nif the Delaware Supreme Court's affirmance of the Superior Court's denial of Claim One \n(A) involved an unreasonable application of Strickland. \nThe record considered by the Delaware state courts in Petitioner's first Rule 61 \nproceeding reveals the following relevant information. Trial counsel retained three \nexperts when formulating a defense theory: Dr. Alvin Turner, Ph.D., an experienced \npsychologist; Dr. James Walsh, Ph.D., a qualified psychological assessor; and Dr. \nCarole Tavani, M.D., a psychiatrist. See Taylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at *25. All three of \nthese experts agreed that Petitioner's behavior was consistent with a diagnosis of \nantisocial personality disorder. See Taylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at *3-9. In addition, Dr. \nTavani stated that Petitioner had a bad temper when he drank, a history of abusing and \nkilling animals, setting a girl's hair on fire, and committing burglaries. Id. at *7-8. \n19 Petitioner told Dr. Tavani that he had \"coke, weed, beer, and alcohol\" the night before \nkilled Williams, and that he had \"six or seven\" girlfriends at the time of the murder. Id. at \n*8. Dr. Tavani advised trial counsel that, as a result of her evaluation, she could not \noffer a psychiatric defense or anything helpful to mitigation. Id. at *9. \nDr. Turner testified that Petitioner had described his family, running away from \nhome, alleged physical abuse by his step-father, education, placement at the Ferris \nschool, and subsequent imprisonment as an adult. Id. at *4. After meeting with \nPetitioner on four different occasions, Dr. Turner completed a written evaluation (which \nhe provided to trial counsel) stating that he did not see basis for a mental illness \ndefense, \"including extreme emotional distress.\" Id. After noting that Petitioner denied \nthe use of alcohol before the murder, Dr. Turner could only opine that Petitioner had an \nantisocial personality disorder. Id. \nDr. Walsh diagnosed Petitioner with antisocial personality disorder, cannabis \ndependence, cocaine abuse, and parent-child relational problems. Id. Although \nPetitioner informed Dr. Walsh that he had stopped drinking, he still regularly used \nmarijuana, occasionally used cocaine, and used heroin and PCP once or twice. Id. at \n*5. Dr. Walsh provided details about Petitioner's background since birth, including how \nhe started selling drugs when he was ten years old because his mother would not buy \nhim expensive sneakers and his stepfather beat him with \"belts, electrical wire, \ndrumsticks, and shoes.\" Id. at *4. Dr. Walsh testified that he believed Petitioner's \njuvenile delinquent behavior came first, followed by school problems, then followed by \nhis parent's discipline. Id. Dr. Walsh also stated that Petitioner was often vague and \nsuspicious making it difficult to determine if he was reliably reporting information. Id. at \n20 *6. \nThe Superior Court also heard the testimony of two new mitigation experts during \nPetitioner's first Rule 61 evidentiary hearings -Dr. Edward Dougherty, a psychologist \nand Dr. Johnathan Mack, a neuropsychologist. Id. at *12-14. Dr. Dougherty testified \nthat Petitioner suffers from the antisocial personality disorder, attention \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, and borderline personality disorder, and concluded that \nPetitioner was under extreme emotional distress at the time in question. Id. at *12. Dr. \nMack opined that his testing of Petitioner supported Dr. Dougherty's diagnosis of \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and also explained that he found evidence of mild \nbrain damage. Id. at *14. Dr. Mack also concluded that Petitioner was under extreme \nemotional distress at the time of the murder due to his belief that Williams was cheating \non him. Id. at *15. \nThe record also reveals that trial counsel \"examined school and Division of \nFamily Services records, and met with [Petitioner[, his mother, his stepfather, and \nothers.\" Taylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at *17. During Petitioner's first Rule 61 proceeding, \ntrial counsel testified that, although they seriously considered pursuing an EEO defense, \nthey could not \"tease\" one out of Petitioner. Id. at *19. \nIt is well-settled that \"strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law \nand facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\" Strickland, 466 \nU.S. at 690. Nevertheless, defense counsel's strategic choices may still amount to \ndeficient performance where there has been a failure to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation before deciding on a particular strategy. See id. at 690-91. The Third \nCircuit has elaborated on counsel's duty to make investigations, explaining that \n21 \"[c]ounsel can make a strategic decision to halt an avenue of investigation to reach that \ndecision, but decisions not to investigate certain types of evidence cannot be called \n'strategic' when counsel fails to seek rudimentary background information.\" Salaam., \n895 F.3d at 268. A reviewing court's \"principal concern in deciding whether [counsel] \nexercised reasonable professional judgment is ... whether the investigation supporting \ncounsel's decision not to introduce mitigating evidence [here, of Petitioner's EEO] was \nitself reasonable.\" Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 522-23. \nAs an initial matter, the aforementioned record demonstrates that trial counsel \ndiligently investigated potential mitigating factors and considered potential defenses \nbased on mental illness and drug addiction. Trial counsel's decision not to investigate \nfurther was reasonable when viewed in context with the opinions provided by the \nretained mental health experts, and the information gleaned from records, Petitioner's \nfriends, his family, and Petitioner himself. \nIn turn, given the results of trial counsel's more than adequate investigation, trial \ncounsel's strategic decision not to pursue an EEO defense did not fall below objective \nstandards of reasonableness. Pursuant to 11 Delaware Code \u00a7 641, \n[t]he fact that the accused intentionally caused the death of \nanother person under the influence of extreme emotional \ndistress is a mitigating circumstance, reducing the crime of \nmurder in the first degree as defined by\u00a7 636 of this title to \nthe crime of manslaughter as defined by \u00a7 632 of this title. \nThe fact that the accused acted under the influence of \nextreme emotional distress must be proved by a \npreponderance of the evidence. The accused must further \nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a \nreasonable explanation or excuse for the existence of the \nextreme emotional distress. The reasonableness of the \nexplanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint \nof a reasonable person in the accused's situation under the \n22 circumstances as the accused believed them to be. Extreme \nemotional distress is not reasonably explained or excused \nwhen it is caused or occasioned by the accused's own mental \ndisturbance for which the accused was culpably responsible, \nor by any provocation, event or situation for which the accused \nwas culpably responsible, or when there is no causal \nrelationship between the provocation, event or situation which \ncaused the extreme emotional distress and the victim of the \nmurder. Evidence of voluntary intoxication shall not be \nadmissible for the purpose of showing that the accused was \nacting under the influence of extreme emotional distress. \n11 Del. Code \u00a7 641. Section 641 places the burden on the defendant to prove that he \nacted \"under the influence of extreme emotional distress\" and \"that there is a \nreasonable excuse or explanation for the existence of the extreme emotional distress.\" \nCapano v. State, 781 A.2d 556, 631 (Del. 2001). As the Superior Court found in \ndenying Claim One (A), \n[Petitioner] repeatedly told trial counsel that before he went to \nWilliams's home, he had been drinking and using drugs, and \nhe knew Williams was pregnant by another man, but he was \nnot jealous about that. Moreover, there was no claim of a \njealous flare-up during the final meeting. [Petitioner] barely \nremembered the actual murder. By the same token, there is \nno evidence, whatsoever, that Williams said or did anything \nthat provoked [Petitioner], much less was there evidence of a \ncausal relationship between any provocation and the murder. \nTaylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at *25. When considered in conjunction with the various \ndiagnoses from the mental health experts trial counsel did retain, Petitioner's criminal \nhistory, and his confession, having Petitioner testify \"would have been disastrous,\" \nbecause the \"State could have easily challenged [Petitioner's] credibility and, in the \nprocess, further emphasized [Petitioner's] felonious background and lack of contrition.\" \nTaylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at *7. Thus, the Court concludes that trial counsel's \n23 investigation into Petitioner's life history and their decision not to pursue an EED \ndefense did not constitute deficient performance under the first prong of the Strickland \nstandard. \nHaving determined that trial counsel did not perform deficiently, the Court does \nnot need to address the issue of prejudice. Nevertheless, the Court concludes that \nPetitioner cannot demonstrate Strickland prejudice. In its 2011 decision on post\u00ad\nconviction appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court stated that \"Drs. Dougherty and Mack D \nbased their opinions on uncorroborated statements [Petitioner] made to them.\" Taylor, \n32 A.3d at 384. Here, Petitioner contends that \"the factual premise upon which the \nDelaware Supreme Court relied in denying [Claim One (A)] was incorrect,\" because the \n\"numerous declarations present counsel obtained\" after his first Rule 61 appeal \nprovides corroboration for those expert opinions. (D.I. 67 at 54) The Court construes \nthis argument as Petitioner's attempt to demonstrate that trial counsel's failure to \nadequately investigate and discover the information contained in the numerous \ndeclarations presented by current counsel prejudiced him, presumably because the \nDelaware Supreme Court would not have discounted the expert opinions as being \nuncorroborated but for trial counsel's deficient performance. 5 The Court is not \n5To the extent the Court should view Petitioner's argument regarding the Delaware \nSupreme Court's \"uncorroborated statements\" statement as an allegation that the \nDelaware Supreme Court made an unreasonable determination of fact under \u00a7 \n2254(d)(2), the argument is summarily rejected. Pursuant to\u00a7 2254(d)(2), the Court \nmust measure the reasonableness of the state court's factual findings against the record \nevidence at the time of the state court's adjudication. See Rountree v. Balicki, 640 F.3d \n530, 538 (3d Cir. 2011 ). Here, the Delaware Supreme Court rendered its \"factual \ndetermination\" that the expert opinions issued by Drs. Mack and Dougherty were \nuncorroborated in 2011. Present counsel, however, did not obtain the instant \ndeclarations until 2013. In short, the Court cannot consider the declarations in \n24 persuaded. Petitioner's detailed summary of his life history as presented in the \nnumerous declarations -including physical and emotional abuse and parental \nabandonment -does not demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have been \nable to establish a viable EEO defense under Delaware law, or that he would have \nfound an expert willing to put forth an EED defense based on that information. In other \nwords, even if trial counsel had broadened their investigation, discovered the additional \ndetailed background information provided in the declarations, and found an expert to \nopine that Petitioner suffered from EED at the time he murdered Williams, Petitioner has \nfailed to demonstrate a \"substantial likelihood of a different result.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. \nat 693. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim One (A) for failing to satisfy\u00a7 2254(d). \nB. Claim Four: Petitioner's Sentence to Life Without Parole \nIn its 2016 decision Rauf v. State, 145 A.3d 430 (Del. 2016), the Delaware \nSupreme Court held that \"Delaware's current death penalty statute violates the Sixth \nAmendment role of the jury\" in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in \nHurst v. Florida, 136 S.Ct. 616 (2016). The Rauf court also addressed the following \nquestion: \nIf any procedure in 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4209's capital sentencing \nscheme does not comport with federal constitutional \nstandards, can the provision for such be severed from the \nremainder of 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4209, and the Court proceed with \ninstructions to the jury that comport with federal constitutional \nstandards? \nId. at 434. The Rauf court answered the question: \nassessing the reasonableness of the Delaware Supreme Court's 2011 factual finding \nbecause the declarations were not part of the record at that point in time. \n25 Id. No. Because the respective roles of the judge and jury are so \ncomplicated under \u00a7 4209, we are unable to discern a method \nby which to parse the statute so as to preserve it. Because \nwe see no way to sever \u00a7 4209, the decision whether to \nreinstate the death penalty-if our ruling ultimately becomes \nfinal-and under what procedures, should be left to the \nGeneral Assembly. \nIn the years following its decision in Rauf, the Delaware Supreme Court clarified \nthat: ( 1) Rauf applies retroactively to a death sentence that was already final when Rauf \nwas decided. See Powell v. State, 153 A.3d 69, 71 (Del. 2016); and (2) Raufs \nseverability question was \"\"only ... whether it was possible to sever the constitutionally\u00ad\ninfirm parts of the capital punishment scheme from the constitutionally-sound ones in a \nway that would preserve the death penalty.\" Zebroski v. State, 179 A.3d 855, 861 (Del. \n2018). In Zebroski, the Delaware Supreme Court explicitly held that \"Rauf did not \u008f \ninvalidate the entirety of section 4209, and, as we said in Powe//, the statute's life\u00ad\nwithout-parole alternative is the correct sentence to impose on a defendant whose \ndeath sentence is vacated. And we find no constitutional fault in imposing that sentence \non him.\" Id. at 857. \nIn 2017, pursuant to Rauf, the Superior Court vacated Petitioner's death \nsentence and resentenced him under\u00a7 4209(a) to life imprisonment without the benefit \nof probation or parole. Petitioner filed a motion to correct or reduce that sentence on \nthree grounds: (1) he should have been resentenced under\u00a7 4205 to an indeterminate \nlife sentence with a mandatory minimum of fifteen years because the plain language in \nRauf rendered \u00a7 4209 void and unenforceable; (2) a mandatory life sentence without \n26 parole constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eight Amendment; and (3) a \nmandatory life sentence without parole violates his Fourteenth Amended due process \nrights. (0.1. 73-9 at 14-22) The Superior Court denied the motion to correct sentence, \nand the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision. \nNow, in Claim Four, Petitioner contends that: (1) given the absence of clear \nlegislative intent in the wake of Rauf finding\u00a7 4209 unconstitutional in its entirety, the \nSuperior Court lacked authority to presume that the Delaware legislature would have \nenacted a mandatory sentence of life without parole and therefore erred by \nresentencing him under 11 Del. Code\u00a7 4209 instead of\u00a7 4205 (0.1. 67 at 89, 91); (2) \nhis mandatory sentence of life without parole constitutes cruel and unusual punishment \nunder the Eighth Amendment (D.I. 67 at 95); and (3) the Superior Court violated his \nright to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment by imposing a mandatory \nsentence of life without parole (D.I. 67 at 89, 95). Generally, a state court's sentencing \ndecision and claims arising out of that decision are not cognizable in a federal habeas \nproceeding, unless the sentencing constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the \nEighth Amendment, exceeds the statutory limits, or is arbitrary or otherwise in violation \nof due process. See Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 465 (1991 ); Estelle v. \nMcGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991); Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975) \n(\"State courts are the ultimate expositors of state law.\"). \n1. Absence of clear legislative intent \nPetitioner contends that, given the absence of clear legislative intent, the \nSuperior Court erred by resentencing him under \u00a7 4205 because Rauf declared \u00a7 4209 \nunconstitutional in its entirety. Whether viewed as an argument that the Delaware state \n27 courts misinterpreted and misapplied a Delaware sentencing statute, or an argument \nthat the Delaware Supreme Court violated the separation of powers between a state \ncourt and a state legislature by resentencing him under\u00a7 4209, Petitioner has asserted \na state law claim that is not cognizable on federal habeas review. See Lewis v. \nJeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990) (holding that, \"Federal habeas corpus relief does not \nlie for errors of state law.\"); Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684,689 n. 4 (1980) (\"the \ndoctrine of separation of powers embodied in the Federal Constitution is not mandatory \non the States\"); Mullaney, 421 U.S. at 691 (\"Federal courts entertaining petitions for \nwrits of habeas corpus are bound by the construction placed on a State's criminal \nstatutes by the courts of that State\"); Austin v. Jackson, 213 F.3d 298, 302 (6th Cir. \n2000) (finding that petitioner's claim asserting his state sentence violated the \n\"separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch in the state \nof Michigan\" was not cognizable on federal habeas review); Johnson v. \nRosemeyer, 117 F. 3d 104, 109 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"[A] state court's misapplication of its \nown law does not [ ] raise a constitutional claim\"). Therefore, the Court will deny the \ninstant sub-argument of Claim Four for failing to assert a proper basis for federal \nhabeas relief. \n2. Eighth Amendment \nNext, Petitioner contends that his mandatory life sentence without parole violates \nthe Eighth Amendment because Delaware is the only non-death penalty state to punish \nan act defined as broadly as \"intentional killing\" with such a sentence. (D.I. 67 at 94-95) \nHe asserts, \"[r]are usage indicates societal rejection of mandatorily imposing this \nextreme penalty, rendering it cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\" (D.I. 67 \n28 at 95) \nPetitioner presented a substantially similar claim to the Delaware Supreme Court \non appeal of the Superior Court's denial of his Rule 35 motion. Citing United States \nSupreme Court and its own precedent, the Delaware Supreme Court rejected the \nargument, stating that \"[t]he Eighth Amendment is not violated every time a State \nreaches a conclusion different from a majority of its sisters over how to best administer \nits criminal laws. Instead, we defer to the General Assembly's determination.\" Taylor, \n2018 WL 121201, at *1 (citing Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263,274 (1980)). Given \nthese circumstances, Petitioner's Eighth Amendment argument will only warrant habeas \nrelief if the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was either contrary to, or an \nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. \n\"[T]he Eighth Amendment contains a narrow proportionality principle that does \nnot require strict proportionality between crime and sentence, but rather forbids only \nextreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime.\" Graham v. \nFlorida, 560 U.S. 48, 59-60 (201 O); see also Ewing v. California, 538 U.S.11, 30 (2003); \nLockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 72 (2003). Although the Supreme Court has not \nidentified clear factors for determining \"gross disproportionality,\"6 it has identified four \nprinciples to be considered when conducting a proportionality review: \"the primacy of \nthe legislature, the variety of legitimate penalogical schemes, the nature of our federal \nsystem, and the requirement that proportionality review be guided by objective \nfactors.\" Ewing v. California, 538 U.S. at 23. \"In conducting this analysis, a court grants \n6Lockyer, 538 U.S. at 72 (noting that \"[o]ur cases exhibit a lack of clarity regarding \nwhat factors may indicate gross proportionality\"). \n29 substantial deference to legislative decisions regarding punishments for crimes.\" United \nStates v. Burnett, 773 F.3d 122, 136 (3d Cir. 2014). As noted by the Supreme Court, \n'\"'one could argue without fear of contradiction by any decision of this Court that for \ncrimes concededly classified and classifiable as felonies, that is, as punishable by \nsignificant terms of imprisonment in a state penitentiary, the length of the sentence \nactual imposed is purely a matter of legislative prerogative.\" Rummel, 465 U.S. at 274. \nNotably, \"[o]utside the context of capital punishment, successful challenges to the \nproportionality of particular sentences [will be] exceedingly rare.\" So/em v. Helm, 463 \nU.S. 277, 289-90 (1983) (emphasis in original); see also Lockyer, 538 U.S. at 77 (\"The \ngross disproportionality principle reserves a constitutional violation for only the \nextraordinary case.\"). \nReviewing the decision of the Delaware Supreme Court in light of the applicable \nlegal principles, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court's rejection of \nPetitioner's instant Eighth Amendment argument was not contrary to or an \nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The Supreme Court has \nheld that a life sentence, even for a non-violent property crime, is constitutional. See \nHarrnelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 961, 994-96 (1995) (upholding a sentence of life \nwithout parole for a defendant convicted of possession more than 650 grams of \ncocaine, even though it was the defendant's first offense); Rummel, 445 U.S. at, 265-66 \n(1980). Moreover, the Delaware Supreme Court's reliance on Rummel was consistent \nwith the Supreme Court's pronouncements in both Lockyer and Ewing. See Lockyer, \n538 U.S. at 74 (stating that \"Harrnelin allows a state court to reasonably rely on Rummel \nin determining whether a sentence is grossly disproportionate.\"); see Ewing, 538 U.S. at \n30 22, (reiterating that \"Rummel stands for the proposition that federal courts should be \nreluctant to review legislatively mandated terms of imprisonment, and that successful \nchallenges to the proportionality of particular sentences should be exceedingly rare.\"). \n3. Due Process \nFinally, Petitioner argues that imposition of a life sentence without the possibility \nof parole violates the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause because, at the time \nof trial, he was not on \"notice that a sentence of life without parole would be the only -\nindeed, the mandatory- sentence upon conviction of first degree murder.\" (D.I. 67 at \n95) He asserts his \"trial strategy sure would have been different\" if he had been on \nnotice, because there \"would have been no penalty phase proceeding at which to \npresent evidence to mitigate the crime.\" (Id.) Notably, Petitioner does not provide any \ndetails about his original strategy and how he would have altered that strategy. \nPetitioner presented this same argument to the Delaware Supreme Court upon \nappeal of the denial of his motion to correct sentence. The Delaware Supreme Court \ndenied the argument because Petitioner \"did not state how the strategy or advice would \nhave differed, nor how it would have affected the outcome of the case.\" Taylor, 2018 \nWL 1212021, at *2. Petitioner's argument in this proceeding suffers from the same \ndeficiency, and speculation as to how trial counsel might have altered their advice or \ntrial strategy is insufficient to establish a due process violation. Given these \ncircumstances, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court's denial of \nPetitioner's due process argument was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable \napplication of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Four in its entirety. \n31 II. Claims Dismissed By Delaware State Courts as Procedurally Barred \nThe remaining Claims in the instant Petition -Claims One (B)-(F), Two and \nThree -were presented to the Delaware state courts in Petitioner's second amended \nRule 61 motion in 2017 (\"second Rule 61 motion\").7 The Superior Court reviewed \nPetitioner's second Rule 61 motion under the version of Rule 61 that was amended in \n2014. After determining that Petitioner did not satisfy the actual innocence exception to \nthe procedural bars in the 2014 version of Rule 61, the Superior Court dismissed the \nmotion as second or subsequent under Rule 61(d)(2). See Taylor, 2018 WL 3199537, \nat *8. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision.8 Taylor, 2019 WL 990718, \nat *1. \nPursuant to the procedural default doctrine, a federal habeas court cannot review \na claim dismissed by a state court \"if the decision of [the state] court rests on a state law \nground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the \njudgment.\" Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729 (1991). The State contends that \nthe post-2014 version of Rule 61(d)(2) is an independent and adequate state procedural \n7The Court recognizes that Petitioner actually filed his original second Rule 61 motion in \nNovember 2014, and then filed his amended second Rule 61 motion in August 2017. \nSee Taylor, 2018 WL 3199537, at *1-2. Since both second Rule 61 motions were filed \nafter the June 4, 2014 amendments to Rule 61, and since the Superior Court only \nconsidered the claims presented in the second amended Rule 61 motion that was filed \nin 2017, the Court's reference to the August 2017 Rule 61 motion does not affect its \nanalysis of the procedural issues in this case. \n8Because the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's judgment \"on the \nbasis of and for the reasons stated in its June 2, 2018 opinion, the Court will \"look \nthrough\" that decision to the Superior Court's opinion denying Petitioner's second Rule \n61 motion as procedurally barred under Rule 61 (d)(2). See Wilson v. Sellers, 138 S.Ct. \n1188, 1192 (2018). \n32 ground and, therefore, Claims One (B)-(F), Two, and Three are barred from habeas \nreview. Petitioner argues that his Claims are not barred because the post-2014 version \nof Rule 61 that was applied to his case does not constitute an \"adequate\" state \nprocedural rule under the procedural default doctrine. Petitioner, however, does not \ncontest the independence of the post-2014 version of Rule 6 (d)(2). Therefore, the \nCourt will address only the \"adequacy\" of the 2014 version of Rule 61 for purposes of \nthe procedural default doctrine. 9 \nA. Relevant Sections of Rule 61 \nDelaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 has been amended at various times, \nbut the inquiry here focuses on the 2006 and 2014 versions of the rule's bar against \nsuccessive motions. In 2006, Rule 61 (i)(2) and (5) provided: \n(2) Repetitive motion -Any ground for relief that was not \nasserted in a prior-post conviction proceeding, as required by \nsubdivision (b)(2) of this rule, is thereafter barred, unless \nconsideration of the claim is warranted in the interest of \njustice. \n* * * \n(5) Bars inapplicable -The bars to relief in paragraphs (1 ), \n(2), and (3) of this subdivision shall not apply to a claim that \nthe court lacked jurisdiction or to a colorable claim that there \nwas a miscarriage of justice because of a constitutional \nviolation that undermined the fundamental legality, reliability, \nintegrity, or fairness of the proceedings leading to the \njudgment of conviction. \nDel. Super. Crim. R. 61 (i)(2), (i)(5) (2005). \nRule 61 was amended in June 2014. The 2014 version of Rule 61 (i)(2) provides: \n9The requirements of independence and adequacy are distinct. Leyva v. Williams, 504 \nF.3d 357, 365 (3d Cir. 2007). A state procedural rule is \"independent\" when resolution \nof the state law question does not depend on a federal constitutional ruling. See Ake v. \nOklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 75 (1985). \n33 (i) Bars to Relief. \n(2) Successive motions. \n(i) No second or subsequent motion is permitted under \nthis Rule unless that second or subsequent motion \nsatisfies the pleading requirements of subparagraphs \n(2)(i) or (2)(ii) of subdivision (d) of this rule. \n(ii) Under paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this Rule, \nany first motion for relief under this rule and that first \nmotion's amendments shall be deemed to have set \nforth all grounds for relief available to the movant. That \na court of any other sovereign has stayed proceedings \nin that court for purpose of allowing a movant the \nopportunity to file a second or subsequent motion \nunder this rule shall not provide a basis to avoid \nsummary dismissal under this rule unless that second \nor subsequent motion satisfies the pleading \nrequirements of subparagraphs (2)(i) or (2)(ii) of \nsubdivision (d) of this rule. \nDel. Super. Crim. R. 61 (d)(2), (i)(2) (2014). The 2014 version of Rule 61 (d)(2) provides: \n(d) Preliminary Consideration. \n(2) Second or subsequent postconviction motions. A \nsecond or subsequent motion under this rule shall be \nsummarily dismissed, unless the movant was \nconvicted after a trial and the motion either: \n(i) pleads with particularity that new evidence \nexists that creates a strong inference that the \nmovant is actually innocent in fact of the acts \nunderlying the charges of which he was \nconvicted; or \n(ii) pleads with particularity a claim that a new \nrule of constitutional law, made retroactive to \ncases on collateral review by the United States \nSupreme Court or the Delaware Supreme \nCourt, applies to the movant's case and renders \nthe conviction or death sentence invalid. \n34 Del. Super. Crim. R. 61(d)(2), (i)(2) (2014). \n8. Adequacy of the 2014 Version of Rule 61 \nA state procedural rule is \"adequate\" to bar federal habeas review if \"it was 'firmly \nestablished and regularly followed\" at the time of the alleged default. Ford v. Georgia, \n498 U.S. 423-24 (1991); Williams v. Beard, 637 F.3d 195,221 (3d Cir. 2011). The \nadequacy requirement \"is intended both to ensure that state courts do not insulate \ndisfavored claims from federal review, and to ensure that federal habeas review is not \nbarred unless petitioners have fair notice of the steps they must take to avoid default.\" \nCampbell v. Burris, 515 F.3d 172, 179 (3d Cir. 2008). \"[A] state procedural bar may \ncount as an adequate and independent ground for denying a federal habeas petition \neven if the state court had discretion to reach the merits despite the default.\" Walker v. \nMartin, 562 U.S. 307, 311 (2011). Additionally, \"[a] discretionary rule ought not be \ndisregarded automatically upon a showing of seeming inconsistencies\" in its \napplication. Id. at 320. In Johnson v. Lee, the Supreme Court held that California's \nDixon bar10 was both firmly established and regularly followed, explaining that the Dixon \nbar is \"firmly established\" because the California Supreme Court warned defendants for \ndecades that, \"absent 'special circumstances,' habeas 'will not lie where the claimed \nerrors could have been, but were not, raised upon a timely appeal from a judgment of \nconviction.\"' Johnson v. Lee, 578 U.S. 605, 608 (2016). The Supreme Court also \nexplained that \"there is little difference between discretion exercised through an \notherwise adequate procedural bar's exceptions and discretion that is a part of the bar \n10\"Under the so-called 'Dixon bar,' a defendant procedurally defaults a claim raised for \nthe first time on state collateral review if he could have raised it earlier on direct appeal.\" \nJohnson , 578 U.S. at 606. \n35 itself.\" Id. at 610-11. \nAs summarized by the Third Circuit: \n[i]n applying these principles, this Court seeks to determine \nwhether the state rule itself provides guidance regarding how \nthe rule should be applied or whether such standards have \ndeveloped in practice. However, neither an occasional act of \ngrace by a state court ... nor a willingness in a few cases to \noverlook the rule and address the claim on the merits renders \na rule inadequate. A rule can be adequate if the state \nsupreme court faithfully applies it in \"the vast majority\" of \ncases. \nCampbell v. Burris, 515 F.3d 172, 179 (3d Cir. 2008). The adequacy of a state \nprocedural bar is a question of federal law. See Lee v. Kemna, 534 U.S. 362, 375 \n(2002). \nPetitioner contends that the prohibition against second or subsequent Rule 61 \nmotions contained in the 2014 version of Rule 61 -as applied to his case -does not \nconstitute an \"adequate state procedural bar'' for procedural default purposes, because \nhe did not have \"fair notice\" of the summary dismissal provisions added to the 2014 \nversion of the rule when he filed his first Rule 61 motion in 2006. The State contends \nthat the prohibition against second or subsequent Rule 61 motions contained in the \n2014 version of Rule 61 constitutes an adequate procedural for two reasons. First, \nwhen Petitioner filed both his first and second motions for postconviction relief, Rule \n61 (i)(2) prohibited defendants from filing claims that were not raised in a prior motion for \npostconviction relief. As a result, in 2006, Petitioner had notice that claims presented in \na successive Rule 61 motion would be procedurally barred. In other words, the bar \nagainst successive motions contained in the 2014 version of Rule 61 was not novel. \n36 Second, the 2014 version of Rule 61 was firmly established and regularly followed when \nPetitioner filed his second amended Rule 61 motion in August 2017 (the date the State \ncontends is the relevant date for default purposes). (D.I. 89 at 10-15) \nThe Third Circuit has articulated a three-step test for determining the adequacy \nof a state procedural rule. See Bronshtein v. Hom, 404 F.3d 700, 708 (2005). First, the \nCourt must identify the relevant rule upon the which the Superior Court based its \ndecision. Here, the relevant rule is the 2014 version of Rule 61. \nSecond, the Court must identify the relevant point in time that Petitioner violated \nthe rule, i.e., committed the default. See Fahy v. Hom, 516 F.3d 169, 188 (3d Cir. 2008) \n(explaining that determining whether a procedural rule was \"firmly established and \nregularly followed is determined as of the date the default occurred, not the date the \nstate court relied on it, because a petitioner is entitled to notice of how to present a \nclaim in state court.\"). Petitioner contends that his default of the rule against successive \nRule 61 motions occurred in 2006 when he filed his first Rule 61 motion without \nincluding all of his claims. The State contends that Petitioner's default occurred in 2017, \nwhen he filed his second Rule 61 motion containing new claims. In Bronshtein, the \nprocedural rule at issue was the one-year statute of limitations applied to Pennsylvania \npost-conviction motions. The Third Circuit found that Bronshtein's default occurred \nwhen he had failed to file a post-conviction motion by the end of the one-year period, \nnot when he filed the motion that was later determined to be time-barred. Id. at 708. \nThis reasoning would indicate that the relevant time period in this case is 2006, when \nPetitioner failed to include all of his claims in his first Rule 61 motion. The Court has \nfound very limited caselaw directly addressing this issue, but that caselaw provides \n37 support for Petitioners contention that his default occurred in 2006. See, e.g., \nPetrocel/li v. Angelone, 248 F.3d 877, 886 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding that the time of default \nof bar on successive state post-conviction petitions occurred when Petrocelli filed his \nfirst state post-conviction petition.); Anderson v. Carlin, 2014 WL 1317610, *8 (D. Idaho \nMar. 31, 2014) (\"'Adequacy' for federal habeas corpus procedural bar purposes is \nmeasured at the time of the purported default -here, the date the successive petition \nwas filed, not the date the court considered it.\"); Blake v. Baker, 2016 WL 5508822, at \n*4 (D. Nev. Sept. 28, 2016) (\"Because the analysis focuses on the time the purported \ndefault occurred and not when a state court actually applies the bar, respondents must \nshow that Nev. Rev .Stat.\u00a7 34.810 had become clear, consistently applied, and well\u00ad\nestablished by the time Blake filed his counseled supplemental petition in his first state \npost-conviction proceeding (May 2007).\"). Therefore, the Court will use 2006 as the \nrelevant date in step three. \nIn the third step of the adequacy inquiry, the Court must determine if the 2014 \nversion of Rule 61 was \"firmly established and regularly followed\" on the date of its \napplication -June 28, 2018. \nAlthough the 2014 version of Rule 61 is fairly recent, Delaware courts have \nconsistently applied the rule to bar successive motions since its enactment. Indeed, \nsince the actual \"bar\" on successive motions has not changed, Delaware courts have \nconsistently applied the rule to bar successive motions for decades. \nPetitioner's challenge to the adequacy of the 2014 version of Rule 61's bar on \nsuccessive motions does not focus on what the two different versions of Rule 61 \nactually \"bar\" but, rather, on the difference in the exceptions to the successive bar \n38 contained in the 2006 and 2014 versions. Specifically, he frames the question in terms \nof whether he had notice in 2006 of the available exceptions to the bar that would apply \nto any future attempt to avoid the procedural bar for successive motions: \nAt the time of [Petitioner's] default [in 2006], he had no notice \nthat, in 2014, the interest of justice and miscarriage of justice \nexceptions would be abolished, and that he would be \nsubjected to a new rule whereby any new and formerly \nadjudicated claims would be summarily dismissed unless he \nwas actually innocent, or plead with particularity that a new \nrule of constitutional law applies to his case rendering his \nconviction or sentence invalid. Therefore, the 2014 default \nbars applied to [Petitioner] in 2018 were inadequate to satisfy \nthe fair notice requirement. \n(D.I. 67 at 19) Elaborating on the difference between the exceptions to the bars in the \n2006 and 2014 versions of Rule 61, he asserts: \nAt the time of [Petitioner's] 2006 default (where he failed to \nadd the majority of the claims before the court), [Petitioner] \nwas on notice that should his counsel fail to file a colorable \nclaim that he was deprived of a substantial constitutional right, \nthis claim would still be considered by the Delaware state \ncourts as long as the evidence supported that his claim was \nmore than mere speculation but less than a colorable \nshowing. He was also on notice that the law of the case and \nformer adjudication doctrines would not be enforced if it was \nin the interest of justice not to do so. If a claim had not been \nraised in a prior post-conviction proceeding, Rule 61 explicitly \nallowed the court to consider the claim \"in the interest of \njustice.\" Rule 61(i)(2) (2005). Similarly, if a defendant raised \n\"a colorable claim that there was a miscarriage of justice,\" \nRule 61 again explicitly allowed the court to consider the \nclaim, even if it was untimely or had not been raised in a prior \nproceeding. Id. In 2006, the Delaware courts recognized that \nthe principles of equity mandated a fail-safe. \n(D.I. 67 at 17) \n39 In practice, however, both the Rule 61(i)(2) and (5) exceptions in the 2006 \nversion of Rule 61 were rarely applied. As explained by the Delaware Supreme Court in \n1990, \"[t]he fundamental fairness exception ... is a narrow one and has been applied \nonly in limited circumstances, such as when the right relied upon has been recognized \nfor the first time after the direct appeal.\" Younger v. State, 580 A.2d 552, 555 (Del. \n1990). Notably, \"[c]ases in which [the Delaware Supreme Court] has previously found \nthat the interests of justice require an exception to the procedural bars of Rule 61(i)(2) \nor (i)(4) have involved specific allegations compelling subsequent factual or legal \ndevelopments that suggest, for example, that a conviction was procured by false \ntestimony or that the court lacked the authority to punish the defendant.\" Deputy v. \nState, 2014 WL 3511720, at *2 n.10 (Del. 2014). Petitioner's claims in his second Rule \n61 motion meets none of these standards and, contrary to his assertion, the exceptions \nin the 2006 version of Rule 61 motion were not a \"fail safe.\" \nThere is no question that the exception to the successive bar in the 2014 version \nof Rule 61 is more restrictive than the 2006 version. Under the 2014 version, \"findings \nof actual innocence [to satisfy the exception to the bar] are reserved for the 'rare' or \n'extraordinary' case.\" See State v. Adkins, 2021 WL 3783636, at *5 (Del. Super. Ct. \nAug. 25, 2021). To date, the Delaware Supreme Court has only held one case to \nsatisfy the exception in the 2014 version of Rule 61: Purnell v. State, 254 A.3d 1053 \n(Del. 2021). The Purnell Court explicitly addressed the difference between the \nexceptions in the pre-and-post 2014 versions of Rule 61: \nPrior to the 2014 amendments, Rule 61 provided an exception \nto the application of the procedural bars involving colorable \nclaims of a miscarriage of justice. As we said in Swan, \"Rule \n40 61 (i)(5) [provides] an exception to the bars of Rule 61 (i)(1 ), \n(2), and (3) for a colorable claim that there was a miscarriage \nof justice because of a constitutional violation that undermined \nthe fundamental legality, reliability, integrity, or fairness of the \nproceedings that lead to the conviction.\" Under the old rule, \nwe have no doubt Purnell would obtain relief on this \nsuccessive motion, without the need to provide compelling \nnew evidence of his actual innocence. \nPurnell, 254 A.3d at 1094, n. 185 (cleaned up). \nFor more than two decades, this Court has consistently found the pre-2014 \nversion of Rule 61(i)(2) to be an adequate (and independent) state procedural bar.11 In \n2016, this Court explicitly held that the Delaware state courts have applied Rule 61 in a \nconsistent and ascertainable manner since 1990. See Zebroski v. Pierce, 2016 WL \n697614, at *8 (D. Del. Feb. 22, 2016). Although this Court in Zebroski recognized that a \n11See Binaird v. Pierce, 981 F. Supp. 2d 281,288 (D.

Del. \n1995). \n41 petitioner could argue that the courts applied Rule 61(i)(2) in his or her case in an \ninconsistent manner, that is not Petitioner's contention in this case. Instead, Petitioner \ncontends that the 2014 version of Rule 61 is inadequate as applied to him because he \ndid not have notice in 2006 that a successive Rule 61 motion would be subject to \nsummary dismissal. \nWhile it is true that Petitioner did not have notice in 2006 that the known \nexceptions to Rule 61 's successive bar would be amended eight years later, the Court \nis not persuaded that the subsequent amendment to the exceptions in a firmly \nestablished and regularly followed procedural bar on successive motions renders the \n2014 version of the successive bar inadequate. As the Third Circuit explained when \nconsidering the adequacy of Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8, the relevant legal issue \nis \"whether, at the relevant point in time, the judicial discretion contemplated by the . \nstate rule is being exercised in a manner that lets people know when they are at risk of \ndefault and treats similarly-situated people in the same manner.\" Campbell v. Burris, \n515 F.3d 172, 181 (3d Cir. 2008). When Petitioner filed his first Rule 61 motion in 2006, \nhe had notice under Rule 61 (i)(2) that obtaining review for successive claims not \nincluded in an initial Rule 61 motion would require the exercise of a defined amount of \njudicial discretion to determine if he fit within one of the statutory exceptions to the bar. \nWhen Petitioner filed his second Rule 61 motion in 2017, he had notice under Rule \n61 (i)(2) that obtaining review for successive claims not included in an initial Rule 61 \nmotion would require the exercise of a defined amount of judicial discretion to determine \nif he could satisfy the statutory exceptions to the bar. Although the defined amount of \njudicial discretion to be exercised when determining if the exceptions are satisfied \n42 changed from 2006 to 2014, at all times Petitioner knew-i.e., had fair notice-that the \nfailure to include all claims in his first Rule 61 motion would result in a default. Viewed \nin this manner, it is evident that Petitioner had fair notice in 2006 that he should include \nall claims in his first Rule 61 motion or risk having subsequent motions be barred as \nsuccessive. See Cabrero v. Barbo, 175 F.3d 307, 313 (3d Cir. 1999) (\"a petitioner \nshould be on notice of how to present his claims in the state courts if his failure to \npresent them is to bar him from advancing them in a federal court.\"). Thus, the Court \nconcludes that the 2014 version of Rule 61, as applied to Petitioner's case, constitutes \nan adequate state procedural bar. \nC. Did Petitioner's Presentation of Claims in his Second Rule 61 Appeal \nExhaust State Remedies \nPetitioner presented the remaining Claims in the instant Petition -Claims One \n(B)-(F), Two and Three -to the Superior Court in his second Rule 61 motion. When \nPetitioner appealed the denial of the motion to the Delaware Supreme Court, he did not \nbrief these claims. Instead, he attached a copy of his second Rule 61 motion to his \nappellate brief. (D.I. 73-16; D.I. 73-17) In its Rule 61 appellate reply, the State asserted \nin a footnote that Petitioner's 11failure to brief the claims he raised below constitutes a \nwaiver and abandonment of those claims on appeal.\" (D.I. 73-25 at 16 n.21) Petitioner \nresponded that he did not waive or abandon the claims, and provided two arguments as \nto why the Delaware Supreme Court should reject the State's assertion. (D.I. 73-26 at \n6) \nThe Delaware Supreme Court did not mention any waiver or abandonment of \nclairr,s when it affirmed the Superior Court's judgment. Instead, it stated, \"after careful \n43 consideration of the parties' briefs and the record on appeal, we find it evident that the \nfinal judgment of the Superior Court should be affirmed on the basis of and for the \nreasons stated in its June 28, 2018 opinion.\" Taylor, 2019 WL 990718, at *1. \nIn this proceeding, the State argues that Petitioner did not exhaust state \nremedies for Claims One (8)-(F), Two and Three because he did not \"fairly present\" the \nClaims to the Delaware Supreme Court on post-conviction appeal. The Court is not \npersuaded. The Delaware Supreme Court did not raise the issue of waiver or \nabandonment in its Order. Rather, it clearly stated it was affirming the Superior Court \nfor the same reasons provided by the Superior Court when it denied Petitioner's second \nRule 61 motion. Given the Delaware Supreme Court's summary affirmance and silence \non the issue of abandonment or waiver, the Court \"looks through\" the Delaware \nSupreme Court's decision to the Superior Court's decision. See Y1 st V. Nunnemaker, \n501 U.S. 797, 804 (1991). The Superior Court thoroughly analyzed the issue of \nPetitioner's procedural default. Therefore, the Court concludes that Petitioner \nexhausted state remedies for his remaining Claims, and that the Delaware Supreme \ndenied them as procedurally barred for the same reasons set forth by the Superior \nCourt. \nD. Martinez Does Not Aid Petitioner In Establishing Cause For His Default \nTo reiterate, the State contends that the Court cannot review the merits of Claims \nOne (8)-(F), Two, and Three unless Petitioner demonstrates cause and prejudice, or \nthat a miscarriage of justice will occur without a merits review. Citing Martinez v. Ryan, \n566 U.S. 1, 9 (2012), Petitioner contends that post-conviction counsel's failure to raise \nthe instant Claims in his first Rule 61 proceeding constitutes cause for his default. \n44 In Martinez, the Supreme Court held that inadequate assistance of counsel \nduring an initial-review state collateral proceeding may establish cause for a petitioner's \nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Id. at 12, 16-17. \nIn order to obtain relief under Martinez, a petitioner must demonstrate that: (1) the \ndefaulted ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim is \"substantial\"; (2) counsel in the \ninitial state collateral review proceeding was ineffective or absent under the standard \narticulated in Strickland; and (3) that he was prejudiced. Id. at 14-17. In Worl<man v. \nSup't Albion SCI, 915 F .3d 928, 938 (3d Cir. 2019), the Third Circuit recognized that, in \norder to show that post-conviction counsel's errors \"caused prejudice under Strickland,\" \na petitioner would have to essentially show that the defaulted claim is itself meritorious. \nId. at 938-39. \"In other words, Martinez appears to require a state prisoner to prevail on \nthe merits of his underlying claim merely to excuse the procedural default and obtain \nconsideration on the merits.\" Owens v. Stirling, 967 F.3d 396,423 (4th Cir. 2020). To \navoid this conundrum, the Third Circuit held that a petitioner satisfies Martinez by \nshowing: (1) that initial postconviction counsel performed deficiently under Strick/ands \nfirst prong by not exhausting the underlying ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim \n(but petitioner does not have to show that post-conviction counsel's deficient \nperformance was prejudicial under Strick/ands second prong); and (2) that the \nunderlying ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim is substantial. See Worl<man, \n915 F.3d at 940. A \"substantial claim\" is one that has \"some merit\", and a petitioner \ndemonstrates \"some merit\" by showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether ( or, \nfor that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner \nor that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed \n45 further.\" Id. at 938. \"If (a petitioner] shows that his underlying ineffective assistance of \ntrial counsel ('IATC') claim has some merit and that his state post-conviction counsel's \nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, he has shown \nsufficient prejudice from counsel's ineffective assistance that his procedural default \nmust be excused under Martinez .11 Id. at 941. \nIn an effort to demonstrate that first post-conviction counsel performed deficiently \nunder Strick/ands first prong and avoid default under Martinez, Petitioner contends that \nfirst post-conviction counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and \npursue grounds for relief beyond claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. (D.I. \n67 at 23) Citing the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and \nPerformance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (\"ABA Guidelines\"), 12 \nPetitioner asserts that post-conviction counsel \"cannot rely on the previously compiled \nrecord but must conduct a thorough, independent investigation, and should litigate a// \nissues, whether or not previously presented, that are arguably meritorious under the \nstandards applicable to high quality capital defense representation.\" (D.I. 67 at 23) \n(emphasis in original) In Petitioner's words: \nInitial post-conviction counsel's failure to investigate, develop \nand present the claims listed below [Claims One (B)-(F), Two\u00ad\nThree] was ineffective because it was not strategic. It is \naxiomatic that a reasonable investigation must take place \nbefore counsel can make a strategic choice regarding which \nissues to include in a habeas petition. \n12Ironically, post-conviction counsel in Petitioner's first Rule 61 proceeding also relied on \nthe ABA Guidelines when arguing that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by \nfailing to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's history. See Taylor, 2010 \nWL 3511272, at *16. \n46 (D.1. 67 at 24) \nPetitioner's summary and conclusory assertion that post-conviction counsel erred \nby not presenting these allegations in his first Rule 61 proceeding does not satisfy his \nburden to demonstrate that post-conviction counsel's representation was objectively \nunreasonable. Significantly, Petitioner completely ignores that the Superior Court \nappointed two attorneys to represent him in his Rule 61 proceeding and post-conviction \nappeal. Instead, he focuses solely on the professional and personal struggles suffered \nby one of his two post-conviction attorneys (\"attorney A\") and describes attorney A's \nhistory of: (1) professional disciplinary issues in 1987, 1991, and 2002; (2) entry of a \nguilty plea in 2013 to two criminal charges of sexual harassment and soliciting sexual \nfavors in exchange for legal services; and (3) a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (\"PTSD\"), and memory limitations as a result of a concussion and use of \nprescription drugs. (D.I. 67 at 9) While attorney A's troubled past is unfortunate and \nmay have had an impact on his (attorney A's) performance, attorney A's personal and \nprofessional history does not necessarily support Petitioner's conclusory statement that \nattorney A \"did not effectively present or litigate all reasonable grounds for relief' in his \nfirst Rule 61 proceeding. (D.I. 67 at 9) Petitioner does not identify any particular \ninstance where attorney A's \"issues\" may have affected his Rule 61 proceeding or \nallege that any particular trial event or decision was affected. To the extent Petitioner is \nsuggesting that the Court should per se declare attorney A ineffective based on his \nprofessional and personal travails, the Court has not found any case indicating that the \nSupreme Court or federal circuit court has adopted a per se rule of ineffective \n47 assistance based on an attorney's suspension from practicing law that occurred at time \nother than counsel's time of representation, PTSTD, or undiagnosed memory issues. \nInexplicably, Petitioner does not address the performance of the other attorney \n(\"attorney B\") who represented him during the first Rule 61 proceeding, despite the fact \nthat she actively participated in the preparation for and litigation of his first Rule 61 \nproceeding.13 There is nothing in the record to indicate that attorneys A and B were not \nequally responsible for making decisions on investigation and arguments to be pursued \nduring Petitioner's first Rule 61 proceeding. Consequently, the Court views Petitioner's \nfailure to even cursorily address how attorney B may have provided deficient \nperformance as a sufficient reason to conclude that Petitioner has failed to establish \nthat the performance of his first post-conviction counsel fell below an objective standard \nof reasonableness. \nMoreover, the fact that Petitioner's current counsel has obtained declarations \nfrom numerous friends and family describing Petitioner's traumatic life history does not \nipso facto demonstrate that first post-conviction counsel failed to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation into what issues to pursue. As articulated by the Supreme Court, \"[w]hen \ncounsel focuses on some issues to the exclusion of others, there is a strong \npresumption that he did so for tactical reasons rather than through sheer neglect.\" \n13Petitioner does not even include attorney B's name in his list of counsel who \nrepresented him during his state court proceedings. {D.I. 67 at 26) While no longer \npracticing law, attorney B {Jennifer-Kate M. Aaronson) was an experienced death \npenalty attorney at the time of Petitioner's Rule 61 proceeding and was subsequently \nappointed chief disciplinary counsel for the Delaware Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \nAttorney B's experience provides additional support for presuming that the failure to \npursue the claims at issue was due to a strategic decision made after a reasonable \ninvestigation rather than deficient performance. \n48 Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U.S. 1, 8 (2003). \"Even if some of the arguments would \nunquestionably have supported the defense, it does not follow that counsel was \nincompetent for failing to include them. Focusing on a small number of key points may \nbe more persuasive .... \" Id. at 7. Here, Petitioner's assertions fail to overcome \nStrick/ands \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of \nreasonable professional assistance.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. \nThe Court also notes that the record does not support and indeed contradicts \nPetitioner's unsubstantiated allegation that post-conviction counsel ( either together or \nindividually) provided ineffective assistance during his first Rule 61 proceeding. \nContrary to Petitioner's assertion, this is not a case in which post-conviction counsel \nonly raised ineffective assistance of counsel claims (IATC). Rather, counsel made nine \nclaims, four of which were for IATC, in the first Rule 61 motion: (1) IATC for failing to \ninvestigate defenses and mitigators; (2) IATC for failing to object to non-statutory \naggravators; (3) Petitioner's waiver of presenting mitigating evidence was not knowing, \nvoluntary, and intelligent; (4) IATC for failing to prepare mental health defenses; (5) \nIATC for failing to object to the trial court's consideration of evidence not presented to \nthe jury; (6) prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument; (7) IATC for failing to \nobject to the trial court's anti-sympathy jury instruction; (8) Delaware's method of \nexecution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment; and (9) Delaware's death penalty \nstatute is unconstitutional. (D.I. 73-18 at 88-110) The Superior Court conducted \nfourteen days of evidentiary hearings, during which post-conviction counsel called the \nfollowing witnesses to testify: trial counsel; Jesse Hambright, a Department of \nCorrection guard who had regular contact with Taylor from 2000 to 2001; Judith Mellen, \n49 former executive director of the ACLU, who investigated overcrowding and harsh \npunishments at Ferris School in 1989 (Petitioner was in Ferris until 1986); Robert \nGolebiewski, a presentence officer who testified at Petitioner's penalty hearing; John \nScholato, Jr., Petitioner's teacher at Ferris School and Gander Hill Prison; David \nRuhnke, Esquire, who had tried fourteen capital cases in Maryland and had reviewed \nPetitioner's file and written a report regarding his opinions; Regina Devlin, mentioned in \nthe confession and introduced above; Brother David; and Ors. Edward Dougherty and \nJonathan H. Mack, postconviction psychologists. See Taylor, 2010 WL 3511272, at 11. \nPost-conviction counsel also attempted to call Petitioner's mother as a witness. \n\"Although [Petitioner's] mother testified at the penalty hearing, she resisted process, \nadamantly refusing to cooperate or testify on her son's behalf at the postconviction \nhearing. The court denied [Petitioner's] request for an arrest warrant.\" Id. at *12. \nAdditional testimony was taken by deposition post-hearing. Id. at *11. \nIn sum, after viewing Petitioner's general allegations regarding attorney A's \nprofessional and personal history, and the lack of any allegations regarding attorney B's \nperformance, in conjunction with this brief summary of the record, the Court concludes \nthat Petitioner has failed to plead facts sufficient to establish that post-conviction \ncounsel's investigation and presentation of claims during his first Rule 61 proceeding \nand appeal fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Thus, Petitioner has \nfailed to establish cause for his default of the IATC arguments in Claims One (B)-(F). \nAdditionally, to the extent Claim One (E) asserts an independent claim that the death \nqualification process created a biased jury, Claim One (F) asserts an independent claim \nalleging prosecutorial misconduct, and Claims Two and Three assert arguments other \n50 than IATC, Martinez does not provide an avenue to establish cause for his default of \nthese Claims because they are not IATC claims. \nE. Petitioner Cannot Demonstrate Actual Prejudice Caused By Default Or \nThat A Miscarriage Of Justice Will Occur Without Review \nIn the absence of cause, the Court does not need to address the issue of \nprejudice. Nevertheless, Petitioner cannot establish that he has suffered prejudice as a \nresult of his procedural default of Claims One (B)-(F), Two, and Three. The Court will \naddress the absence of prejudice and the unavailability of the miscarriage of justice \nexception with respect to Petitioner's remaining Claims in seriatim. \n1. Claim One (B): Failure to retain a forensic pathologist \nIn Claim One (B), Petitioner contends that trial counsel failed to consult with a \nforensic pathologist to prepare for trial and, therefore, was not prepared to rebut the \n\"false and inaccurate\" testimony concerning the details of Williams' death provided by \nthe State medical examiner, Dr. Adrienne Sekula-Perlman. (D.I. 67 at 55) Petitioner \nasserts that that the medical examiner's testimony provided the only evidence of intent, \nand she inaccurately testified that: (1) it took Williams four minutes to die by \nstrangulation; and (2) the blunt and sharp force injuries to Williams' body contributed to \nher death. (D.I. 67 at 55-56) According to Petitioner, \"it is likely that [he] would have \nbeen convicted of a lesser offense\" if trial counsel had presented a qualified expert. \n(D. I. 67 at 55) Petitioner is incorrect. \nAt trial, the medical examiner testified that a person who is strangled by ligature \nwill first lose consciousness and then die \"after approximately four minutes or so.\" (D.I. \n41-48 at 5) Petitioner argues that the report of his postconviction expert, Dr. Charles \n51 Wetli, proves that the medical examiner's statement is wrong. In his report, Dr. Wetli \nasserts, \"[o]ne cannot dogmatically state how long it takes to die in a homicidal \nstrangulation[] but certainly in less than the four minutes Dr. Sekula-Perlman testified it \nwould have taken.\" (D.I. 73-24 at 63) Dr. Wetli's report also states, \"because of the \ndeceased's morbid obesity, which led to an already compromised chest cavity and \nairway, loss of consciousness and death likely ensued even more rapidly,\" and that \n\"neither sharp force nor blunt force injuries contributed to[] Williams' death. (Id. at 61-\n63) \nDr. Wetli's determinations do not aid Petitioner in demonstrating ineffective \nassistance, because the facts of this case do not hinge on how long it took Williams to \ndie once strangled. In his confession note, Petitioner admitted that he strangled, beat, \nand \"stuck a long kitchen knife down [Williams'] mouth and cut something in her throat.\" \nTaylor, 822 A.2d at 1054 n.5. Even with the opinion of a different pathologist, the facts \nof this case prove intentional murder. Therefore, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that \ntrial counsel's failure to retain a forensic pathologist actually prejudiced him. \nThe Court also concludes that the miscarriage of justice exception does not apply \nto excuse Petitioner's default of the instant Claim, because he has not provided new \nreliable evidence of his actual innocence. Therefore, the Court will deny Claim One (8) \nas procedurally barred. \n2. Claim One (C): Failure to object to evidence of Williams' \npregnancy \nPetitioner argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the \n\"prejudicial and irrelevant\" evidence that Williams was pregnant when he murdered her. \n52 His argument is meritless. The fact of Williams' pregnancy would have been before the \njury with or without objection from trial counsel. Petitioner's handwritten confession note \nstated: \"There should be no sympathy for me because I killed a pregnant woman who \nwas carrying my child.\" (D.1. 41-47 at 126) In addition, the autopsy protocol confirmed \nthat Petitioner was pregnant when Petitioner murdered her, and that the fetus died as a \nresult. (D.1. 41-48 at 6) The State could properly present evidence of Williams' \npregnancy to prove Petitioner's state of mind, i.e., that he committed intentional murder. \nPetitioner has failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from trial counsel's failure to \nobject to evidence of Williams' pregnancy. \nThe Court also concludes that the miscarriage of justice exception does not apply \nto excuse Petitioner's default of the instant Claim, because he has not provided new \nreliable evidence of his actual innocence. Therefore, the Court will deny Claim One (C) \nas procedurally barred. \n3. Claim One (D): Failure to adequately litigate the motion to \nsuppress his confession note \nIn Claim One (D), Petitioner contends that trial and appellate counsel were \nineffective for failing to succeed in suppressing his handwritten confession. Trial \ncounsel filed a motion to suppress Petitioner's confession note on the basis that the \npolice violated his Fourth Amendment rights by seizing and reading the note without a \nwarrant during an inventory search of his belongings in the turnkey area of police \nheadquarters. The Superior Court denied the motion. See State v. Taylor, 2001 WL \n282813, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 20, 2001). Petitioner raised the issue on direct \nappeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's decision. See \n53 Taylor, 822 A.2d at 1055-56. Specifically, the Delaware Supreme Court held that this \ntype of routine inventory search was a well-defined exception to the warrant \nrequirement and, therefore, did not violate the United States Constitution. See id. at \n1055. \nIn this proceeding, Petitioner contends that trial and appellate counsel should \nhave moved to suppress the confession note on the ground that the note was searched \nand seized without a warrant in order to gather evidence against Petitioner for Williams' \ndeath. In essence, Petitioner is arguing that the officer's inventory search was an \nexcuse to search Petitioner's person without a warrant. \nTo the extent the instant argument constitutes an independent claim that the \npolice violated his Fourth Amendment rights in searching and seizing his confession \nnote, the Court concludes that it fails to assert a proper basis for federal habeas relief \nunder the doctrine established in Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 494 (1976). In Stone, \nthe Supreme Court held that federal courts cannot provide habeas review of Fourth \nAmendment claims if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to litigate Fourth \nAmendment claims in the state courts. Id.; see Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277,293 \n(1992) (\"We have also held ... that claims under Mapp [alleging evidence obtained in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment] are not cognizable on habeas as long as the courts \nhave provided a full and fair opportunity to litigate them at trial or on direct review.\"). A \npetitioner has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate such claims if the state has an \navailable mechanism for suppressing evidence seized in or tainted by an illegal search \nor seizure, irrespective of whether the petitioner actually availed himself of that \nmechanism. See Boyd v. Mintz, 631 F.2d 247, 250 (3d Cir. 1980); U.S. ex rel. Hickey v. \n54 Jeffes, 571 F .2d 762, 766 (3d Cir. 1978); Petillo v. New Jersey, 562 F .2d 903, 906-07 \n(3d Cir. 1977). Conversely, a petitioner has not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate \na Fourth Amendment claim, and therefore, avoids the Stone bar, if the state system \ncontains a structural defect that prevented the state from fully and fairly hearing his \nFourth Amendment claims. See Marshall v. Hendricks, 307 F.3d 36, 82 (3d Cir. 2002). \nHere, Petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment \nclaim. As just discussed, he filed a pre-trial motion to suppress the confession note. \nThe Superior Court conducted a hearing, and denied the motion. Petitioner challenged \nthe denial of the suppression motion on direct appeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court \naffirmed the Superior Court's decision. Even if Petitioner disagrees with trial counsel's \nchoice of argument, Petitioner still had a \"full and fair\" opportunity to litigate his Fourth \nAmendment claim. See, e.g., Marshall, 307 F.3d at 82 (holding that \"[a]n erroneous or \nsummary resolution by a state court of a Fourth Amendment claim does not overcome \nthe [Stone] bar.\"); Gilmore v. Marks, 799 F.2d 51, 57 (3d Cir. 1986). \nPetitioner also cannot demonstrate that he was actually prejudiced by trial \ncounsel's failure to base the suppression motion on the argument asserted here, or that \nhe was prejudiced by appellate counsel's failure to raise this argument on appeal, \nbecause his instant argument is primarily a distinction without a difference. On direct \nappeal, trial counsel argued that \"by unfolding the Confessional Letter and reading it the \npolice exceeded the scope of the inventory search.\" Taylor, 822 A.2d at 1055. The \nDelaware Supreme Court found that, during a routine inventory search, it was not \n\"unreasonable\" for police to search any container or article in his possession, \"in \naccordance with established inventory procedures.\" Id. By finding that the police did \n55 not exceed the scope of the inventory search, the Delaware Supreme Court subsumed \nPetitioner's present argument. In short, the motion to suppress failed because it lacked \nmerit. Thus, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that he was actually prejudiced by trial and \nappellate counsel's failure to present another version of a meritless argument. \nThe Court also concludes that the miscarriage of justice exception does not apply \nto excuse Petitioner's default of the instant Claim, because he has not provided new \nreliable evidence of his actual innocence. Therefore, the Court will deny Claim One (D) \nas procedurally barred. \n4. Claim One (E): Failure to Object to Biased Jury \na. Death-qualification of The Jurors \nPetitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to \nobject to the Superior Court's decision to strike a number of jurors for cause, based \nupon their opposition to the death penalty, thereby resulting in a jury that was \"biased \ntowards conviction.\" (D.I. 67 at 69-71) Petitioner also presents an independent claim \nthat the \"death qualification process of [his] jury created a jury that was biased in favor \nof conviction and violated his right to a fair and impartial jury.\" (D.I 67 at 83) \nIn Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985), the Supreme Court held that \"the \nproper standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause \nbecause of his or her views on capital punishment.. .is whether the juror's views would \n'prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance \nwith his instructions and his oath.'\" Id. at 424 (quoting Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38, 45 \n(1980)). The Witt Court explained that: \n56 this standard ... does not require that a juror's bias be proved \nwith \"unmistakable clarity\" ... because determinations of juror \nbias cannot be reduced to question-and-answer sessions \nwhich obtain results in the manner of a catechism. What \ncommon sense should have realized experience has proved: \nmany veniremen simply cannot be asked enough questions \nto reach the point where their bias has been made \n\"unmistakably clear\"; these veniremen may not know how \nthey will react when faced with imposing the death sentence, \nor may be unable to articulate, or may wish to hide their true \nfeelings. Despite this lack of clarity in the printed record, \nhowever, there will be situations where the trial judge is left \nwith the definite impression that a prospective juror would be \nunable to faithfully and impartially apply the law. \nId. at 424-26 ( cleaned up). Pursuant to Witt, a federal habeas court must defer \"to the \ntrial judge who sees and hears the jurors.\" Id. at 428. The Third Circuit has reiterated \nthat the \"trial court is in the best position to observe the demeanor of the prospective \njurors.\" Deputy v. Taylor, 19 F.3d 1485, 1499 (3d Cir. 1994). \nPetitioner asserts that four jurors should not have been \"sua sponte\" excused by \nthe Superior Court after indicating they were opposed to the death penalty. (D.I. 67 at \n69-72) He also asserts that the Superior Court improperly excused five additional jurors \nfor cause on the basis that they would not recommend or vote for imposition of the \ndeath penalty. (D.I. 67 at 72) \nThe record rebuts Petitioner's underlying contention that qualified jurors were \nimproperly excused based upon their death penalty views because, upon direct \nquestioning, all nine jurors stated they would be unable to impose the death penalty. \nProspective juror PB said she was opposed to the death penalty but \"guess[ed]\" she \n\"might be able\" to recommend the death penalty. Further questioning revealed that PB \ndid not understand the balancing of aggravators and mitigators. (D.I. 41-39 at 13-14) \n57 After asking and receiving no objection from Petitioner and the State, the Superior Court \nexcused PB. Regardless of personal feelings, any juror's ability to follow the law is \npredicated upon a basic understanding of the law and the process. Pursuant to Witt, \nPetitioner cannot demonstrate actual prejudice. \nProspective juror LK had many issues with being called as a juror -she had \ntrouble sitting in confined spaces, her family needed her, she had heard about the case \nin the news, and she further stated that she did not \"approve\" of the death penalty. (D.I. \n41-38 at 47) Thus, Petitioner cannot demonstrate prejudice resulting from LK's excusal, \nbecause the Superior Court had ample reasons to excuse the juror aside from her \nopposition to the death penalty. \nProspective juror RC stated he had trouble with the death penalty and would \nhave \"a lot of trouble living with [his] conscience if' he condemned someone to death. \nRC also stated that he could \"find someone guilty or not guilty of a particular crime, but I \ndon't think, in this day and age, we should be killing people.\" (D.I. 41-37 at 2) The \nSuperior Court found that RC's clear opposition to the imposition of the death penalty \nprecluded him from sitting on the jury. Petitioner agreed that the juror was not qualified. \n(/d.) Petitioner has failed to demonstrate actual prejudice. \nProspective juror BD unequivocally stated that he could \"never'' recommend the \ndeath penalty, regardless of the facts. (D.I. 41-39 at 26-27) The Superior Court \nexcused BD without objection as he did not qualify for a juror under the criteria set forth \n58 in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 51 O (1968).14 Petitioner cannot demonstrate \nprejudice resulting from BD being struck for cause. \nPetitioner contends that the Superior Court should not have struck for cause five \njurors who stated that they could perform the statutory duty of determining whether the \naggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, but regardless, \nwould not recommend death.15 Petitioner argues that \"recommending death was not \npart of the law.\" (D.I. 67 at 72) Petitioner is incorrect. At the time of Petitioner's trial, \nDelaware law required each potential juror to weigh the aggravators against the \nmitigators and individually vote on his or her recommendation. See 11 Del. Code \u00a7 \n4209(c)(3)b. The Superior Court was required to consider the jury's final votes on the \naggravators and mitigators when deciding what sentence to impose. Petitioner has \n141n Witherspoon, the Supreme Court held that \"a sentence of death cannot be carried \nout if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for \ncause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed \nconscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. No defendant can \nconstitutionally be put to death at the hands of a tribunal so selected.\" 391 U.S. at 522-\n23. Consequently, veniremen can be excluded based on their views on capital \npunishment only if they would be biased and lack impartiality in hearing the case. \n15 Prospective juror JZ said that he opposed the death penalty, was not going to be able \nto recommend it, and that both his priest and son had told him that, as a good Catholic, \nhe could not suggest the death penalty. (D.I. 41-41 at 16-17) The State challenged \nprospective juror AD for cause because he stated he was opposed to the death penalty \nand he could not put his personal feelings aside and follow the law as it required. (D.I. \n41-37 at 49) The State moved to strike prospective juror MT for cause after she stated \nthat she had \"a real concern about sitting on a case where [she] knew the death penalty \n[was] an option,\" and that she just \"ha[s] this thing about taking another human life.\" \n(D.I. 41-38 at 11) Prospective juror JS stated that he did not believe in the death \npenalty and would vote \"no\" if asked. (D.I. 41-38 at 17) Prospective juror BF stated he \nhad childcare issues, that anyone \"charged\" with murder should be locked away for life, \nand he was religiously opposed to the death penalty. (D.I. 41-39 at 2-3) \n59 failed to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the Superior Court's accurate \nstatement of the role and duties of each potential juror. \nb. Juror Taint \nPetitioner contends that his right to an impartial jury was compromised because \nseveral prospective jurors told the Superior Court that they had discussed the case with \nother members of the jury pool. Petitioner argues that trial counsel provided ineffective \nassistance by failing to properly object to the discussion between the potential jurors \nand by failing to \"ensure that members of the jury were adequately questioned.\" (D.I. 67 \nat 75-76) \nIn Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415 (1991), the Supreme Court acknowledged \nthat \"our own cases have stressed the wide discretion granted to the trial court in \nconducting voir dire in the area of pretrial publicity and in other areas of inquiry that \nmight tend to show juror bias.\" Id. at 427. If a trial court becomes aware of possible \njuror bias, it must investigate the source of the alleged bias, \"determine its impact on the \njuror, and decide whether it was prejudicial.\" Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227, \n230 (1954); see Anderson v. Phelps, 930 F. Supp. 2d 552,565 (D. Del. 2013). If the \nallegation of juror bias arises before the verdict, the trial court has \"wide discretion\" to \ndetermine the appropriate procedure to assess it. See Reed v. Carroll, 2005 WL \n2086745, at *7 (D. Del. Aug. 26, 2005). It is well-settled that \"voir dire provides a means \nof discovering actual or implied bias,\"16 and the juror's responses are not inherently \nsuspect. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209,217 n.7 (1982). If the jury bias claim \n\"does not involve contact with a juror during a trial about a matter pending before the \n16J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 143 (1994). \n60 jury ... , a new trial will only be warranted if the defendant proves that he was actually \nprejudiced by the improper contact.\" Reed, 2005 WL 20867 45, at *6. Thus, in such \ncases, the defendant \"has the burden of proving actual juror bias.\" Anderson, 930 F. \nSupp. 2d at 565. \nPetitioner's instant contention regarding the tainted jury pool is not supported by \nthe record and, in fact, is pure speculation. The discussions between potential jurors \noccurred during voir dire and none of the potential jurors identified by Petitioner were \nseated. The Superior Court cautioned the selected jurors in the \"strongest terms\" not to \ndiscuss the case with anyone. (0.1. 41-39 at 43) When the Superior Court realized a \npossible taint issue, it addressed the final panel of 16 jurors prior to the start of the trial \nas follows: \nSUPERIOR COURT: Now, the first question I want to \nask you today is have you spoken with anyone about \nthis case, including with other members of the jury \nsince you were last in court? \n(Jurors shake their heads.) \nSUPERIOR COURT: Have you seen, read, or heard \nanything in the media about this case at any point? \nJURY: No. \nSUPERIOR COURT: And, finally, I discussed this, I \nthink, with some of you during jury selection, but I want \nto be clear about this. Apparently during jury selection, \nat one or more times, one or two jurors who thought \nthey had some personal knowledge concerning this \ncase were so indiscreet as to say what was on their \nminds out loud. And I gather that at least a small \nnumber of other jurors in the panel heard some of what \nthose jurors had to say. \n61 (D.1. 41-47 at 11-12) So I want to ask you specifically, while you were in the \nprocess of being selected, either when we were in \nCourtroom 301, the first big courtroom you were in, or \nduring the questioning that each one of you went \nthrough in connection with the jury selection, did you \nhear any other jurors talking about this case? \nJURY: No. \nBased on the question the Superior Court posed and the collective answer of the \njury, the trial record reflects that the empanelled jury was not tainted. Because \nPetitioner's claim of juror taint is unsupported by the record, he cannot show that trial \ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to ask the Superior Court to question \nthe jury further. Accordingly, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting \nfrom his default of these arguments. \nThe Court also concludes that the miscarriage of justice exception does not apply \nto excuse Petitioner's default of the instant Claim, because he has not provided new \nreliable evidence of his actual innocence. Therefore, the Court will deny Claim One (E) \nas procedurally barred. \n5. Claim One (F): Prosecutorial misconduct \nPetitioner asserts that trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance \nby failing to argue that the State committed the following three instances of \nprosecutorial misconduct: (1) presenting the testimony of Tawana Ricks, Williams' \nsister who found Williams' children alone outside on the morning of the murder; (2) \nimproperly appealing to the emotions of the jury in opening statements; and (3) \ndisparaging trial counsel and vouching for the State in rebuttal closing argument. For \n62 the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that the State did not engage in \nprosecutorial misconduct. Relatedly, trial and appellate counsel did not provide \nineffective assistance by failing to raise meritless objections. \nIn order for a prosecutorial misconduct claim to warrant federal habeas relief, the \nprosecutor's actions must have \"so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the \nresulting conviction a denial of due process.\" Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, \n643 (1974); Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 180 (1986). A prosecutorial \nmisconduct claim must be examined in \"light of the record as a whole\" in order to \ndetermine whether the conduct \"had a substantial and injurious effect or influence\" on \nthe jury's verdict. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 638 (1993). When evaluating \nthe impact of a prosecutor's misconduct, if any, a court must consider: (1) the extent to \nwhich the claimed misconduct tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the petitioner; (2) \nwhether it was isolated or extensive: and (3) whether the claimed misconduct was \ndeliberate or accidental. See United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1985). A \ncourt must also consider: (1) the strength of the overall proof establishing guilt; (2) \nwhether defense counsel objected to the alleged misconduct; and (3) whether the trial \ncourt gave a curative instruction. See id. at 12-13; Darden, 477 U.S. at 181-82. \na. Testimony of Williams' sister, Tawana Ricks \nPetitioner asserts that the State only called Ricks to testify in order garner the \njury's sympathy. This contention is unsupported by the record. \nPrior to Ricks' testimony, the Superior Court held a sidebar for a \"quick proffer.\" \n(D.I. 41-47 at 59) The judge expressed his concern about Ricks' emotional state and \nstated that, if Ricks was going to get emotional, the prosecution should quickly elicit the \n63 needed testimony to limit the injection of any unnecessary emotion into the trial. (Id. at \n60-61) The State advised the judge that the important fact it wanted to elicit was that \nPetitioner and Williams were involved in a romantic relationship. (Id. at 60-61) Once on \nthe stand, Ricks testified that her sister had been in a relationship with Petitioner. After \nasking four questions, the State asked Ricks to identify Petitioner. (Id. at 61) Ricks \nbecame upset and said that she could not look at Petitioner. (Id. at 61) The prosecution \nimmediately stated, \"Your Honor, I have nothing further for this witness.\" (Id. at 62) \nThe judge asked trial counsel if they had any questions. While trial counsel were \nconferring, Ricks sua sponte decided to answer the prosecution's question and \nidentified Petitioner. (D.I. 41-47 at 62) Trial counsel did not cross-examine Ricks, and \ndid not object either prior or during the direct examination. Immediately after Ricks \ntestified, the Superior Court provided the following curative instruction: \n(D.I. 41-47 at 62-63) Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, as you can \nunderstand, there is an emotional aspect to any case \nwhere someone has died. And family members, in \nparticular, human nature being what it is, are going to \nfeel the loss particularly strongly. As jurors, you have \nto view the evidence like objective people who do not \nhave a personal interest in the case, and so you must \ntake any feelings of emotion that are exhibited in the \ncourtroom and put them aside for purposes of your \ndeliberations. \nViewing this record within the applicable legal framework demonstrates that the \nState did not commit misconduct. Ricks provided relevant testimony and the prosecutor \nstrictly limited the witness's testimony to reduce the jury's exposure to additional \npotentially emotional testimony. Rick's emotional testimony was an isolated \n64 occurrence, and was clearly not deliberate on the part of the prosecution. In fact, once \nthe prosecutor conducting Ricks' direct examination saw that she was becoming too \nemotional, he ended his questioning. The State's case was strong given the physical \nevidence and, more importantly, Petitioner's confession. Additionally, trial counsel did \nnot object to Ricks' testimony and the trial judge gave an immediate curative instruction. \nGiven these circumstances, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that Ricks' testimony \nresulted in an unfair trial. \nb. Opening statements \nPetitioner contends that the State's \"narrative of Ms. Williams' morning was \ncalculated to prey on the jury's emotions and inflame their passions by bringing to life in \nthe courtroom the deceased and those she left behind.\" (D.I. 67 at 79) He further \nalleges that the statements \"effectively placed each juror in the shoes of the victim.\" \n(Id.) Petitioner is incorrect. \nA prosecutor does not commit misconduct during opening statement by referring \nto evidence the prosecutor intends to introduce and which, in good faith, he or she \nbelieves is admissible. See, e.g., Lawrie v. Snyder, 9 F. Supp. 2d 428, 442-43 (D. Del. \n1998); United States v. Bugg, 483 F. App'x 166, 171 (6th Cir. 2012); United States v. \nChirinos, 112 F.3d 1089, 1098 (11th Cir. 1997). Evidence regarding what the victim was \ndoing just prior to the murder and how the family members came to discover her body \nwas relevant and admissible at trial. The prosecutor may offer a complete picture of the \nfacts surrounding a crime in order to show context and motive. Here, the opening \nstatement was not emotional and did not include inflammatory language. Trial counsel \ndid not object and the Superior Court did not react. When viewed in light of the whole \n65 record as a whole, the prosecutor's statements did not render Petitioner's trial \nfundamentally unfair. \nc. Rebuttal closing argument \nPetitioner argues that the prosecutor, during closing rebuttal argument, \ndisparaged trial counsel and improperly vouched for the State. Specifically, Petitioner \ncontends that the prosecutor \"likened the defense to salesmen.\" (D.I. 67 at 80) What \nPetitioner fails to mention is that, in his opening statement, trial counsel likened the \nprosecutor's opening statement to a sales pitch: \nClassically, in law school we are told that it's an opportunity \nfor the lawyers to tell the jury what they expect the evidence \nto be. And, indeed, the prosecution has done that. It is an \nexpectation, just like a sales pitch. However, what you will be \njudging is not the sales pitch but the product. And the defense \nasks you as you [sic] judge that product, use your common \nsense and use your everyday experiences. Analyze, test, \nevaluate that product. Because at the end of the case you're \ngoing to have to determine whether or not that product is \nsomething that you can rely upon, whether or not that product \nmeets that very heavy burden placed upon the State in this \ncase. \n(D.I. 41-47 at 28). \nThe defense counsel again argued in closing argument: \nThe State in its opening statement got up, and I believe the \nanalogy that [the prosecutor] used when he was talking to you \nwas basically advertising a product and, at the end of the day, \nthe end of today literally, it's up to you to take that product and \ntest it and utilize it and decide if it's all that it was sold to you \nas, if it's all that it's cracked up to be. \n(D.I. 41-49 at 6) \nThe excerpts from the trial transcript speak for themselves. It was trial counsel, \nnot the prosecutor, who made the first \"salesmen\" reference. The prosecutor's \n66 statement during rebuttal argument was an attempt to clarify that the State was not \ntrying to \"sell\" a product but, rather, presenting evidence for the jury to consider. There \nsimply was no prosecutorial misconduct. \nPetitioner also asserts that the prosecutor in rebuttal closing argument improperly \nvouched for the State by informing the jury what they already knew -that he was a \nprosecutor, not a salesman. \nBut I am an attorney. I'm a prosecutor for the State of \nDelaware. I am charged with the duty of submitting facts to \nyou for you to evaluate. And that's what we've done in this \ncase. We have the chance to get up here and argue to you all \nreasonable inference from the facts that have been \npresented. We have presented those facts. Those facts are \nbefore you in this case. To suggest that this murder may have \nbeen an accident is outrageous, we submit to you. We've got \nan autopsy report, cause of death, strangulation. Manner of \ndeath: Homicide -not accident, homicide. \n(D.I. 41-49 at 31) \nAgain, the excerpt speaks for itself. The prosecutor did not improperly vouch for \nthe State by referencing the truth or asserting he had special knowledge. The \nprosecutor's argument was proper. \nHaving determined that the State did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct in \nthe manner alleged by Petitioner, his related ineffective assistance of trial and appellate \ncounsel claims necessarily fail. Therefore, he cannot demonstrate that he will suffer \nactual prejudice as a result of the default of these arguments. \nThe Court also concludes that the miscarriage of justice exception does not apply \nto excuse Petitioner's default of the instant Claim, because he has not provided new \nreliable evidence of his actual innocence. Therefore, the Court will deny Claim One (F) \n67 as procedurally barred. \n6. Claim Two: Ineffective Assistance of Appellate and Post\u00ad\nConviction Counsel \nIn Claim Two, 17 Petitioner asserts that appellate counsel provided ineffective \nassistance by failing to raise the following Claims on direct appeal: (1) the evidence of \nWilliams' pregnancy was improperly admitted as evidence (related to Claim One (C)); \n(2) the confession note was improperly admitted at trial (related to Claim One (D)); (3) \nPetitioner was denied a fair and impartial jury (related to Claim One (E)); and (4) the \nState engaged in prosecutorial misconduct (related to Claim One (F)). (D.I. 67 at 85-86) \nPetitioner also asserts that, to \"the extent initial post-conviction counsel failed to argue \nappellate counsel's ineffectiveness, they too were ineffective.\" (D.I. 67 at 86) \nPetitioner presented his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel argument to \nthe Delaware state courts in his second Rule 61 motion. As previously discussed, his \nsecond Rule 61 motion was denied as procedurally barred. To the extent he blames \nfirst post-conviction counsel for not presenting the issue of appellate counsel's \nineffective assistance in his first Rule 61 motion in an attempt to establish cause, it is \nunavailing. The narrow exception articulated in Martinez applies only to allegations \nconcerning trial counsel's ineffectiveness, not claims alleging the ineffectiveness of \nappellate counsel. See Davila, 137 S.Ct. 2058, 2065 (2017) (declining \"to extend \nMartinez to allow a federal court to hear a substantial, but procedurally defaulted, claim \nof ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\"). \nIn the absence of cause, the Court need not address the issue of prejudice. The \n17The Petition identifies this Claim as Claim Four. (D.I. 67 at 85) \n68 Court also concludes that the miscarriage of justice exception does not apply to excuse \nPetitioner's default of the instant Claim, because he has not provided new reliable \nevidence of his actual innocence. Therefore, the Court will deny Claim Two as \nprocedurally barred. \n7. Claim Three: Cumulative Error \nNext, Petitioner contends that the cumulative effect of each alleged error is \nsufficiently prejudicial to require relief. (D.I. 67 at 86-88) He argues that, even if none \nof his individual errors merit relief, the cumulative impact of the errors deprived him of a \nfair trial. \nIt appears that the United States Supreme Court has not recognized the concept \nof cumulative error. See Bush v. Carpenter, 926 F.3d 644, 686 n.16 (10th Cir. 2019). \nSince there is no clearly established federal law with respect to a cumulative error \nargument, arguably the Court's\u00a7 2254(d) analysis is over and Petitioner is not entitled \nto habeas relief for Claim Three. \nNevertheless, the Third Circuit has recognized the cumulative error doctrine on \nhabeas review, holding that \"a cumulative error argument constitutes a stand-alone \nconstitutional claim subject to exhaustion and procedural default.\" Collins v. Sec'y of Pa. \nDep't of Corr., 742 F.3d 528, 542 (3d Cir. 2014). Pursuant to the cumulative error \ndoctrine, \n[i]ndividual errors that do not entitle a petitioner to relief may \ndo so when combined, if cumulatively the prejudice resulting \nfrom them undermined the fundamental fairness of his trial \nand denied him his constitutional right to due process. \nCumulative errors are not harmless if they had a substantial \nand injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's \nverdict, which means that a habeas petitioner is not entitled to \n69 relief based on cumulative errors unless he can establish \nactual prejudice. \nFahy v. Hom, 516 F.3d 169, 205 (3d Cir. 2008). \nPetitioner presented this argument to the Delaware state courts in his second \nRule 61 motion, and they denied it as procedurally barred. To the extent Petitioner \nattempts to establish cause by alleging the ineffectiveness of first post-conviction \ncounsel for not presenting the cumulative error argument in his first Rule 61 motion, it is \nunavailing. Again, the narrow exception articulated in Martinez applies only to \nallegations concerning trial counsel's ineffectiveness. \nIn the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue of prejudice. \nAdditionally, Petitioner has not demonstrated that the miscarriage of justice exception to \nthe procedural default doctrine applies, because he has not provided new reliable \nevidence of his actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Three as \nprocedurally barred. \nCERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide \nwhether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011 ); 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2253(c)(2). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \n\"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\" by demonstrating \"that \nreasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims \ndebatable or wrong.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n484 (2000). \nFurther, when a federal court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds \n70 without reaching the underlying constitutional claim, the petitioner must demonstrate \nthat jurists of reason would find debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid claim \nof the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its \nprocedural ruling. See Slack, 529 U.S. at 484. \"Where a plain procedural bar is present \nand the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist \ncould not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the \npetitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\" Id. \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Claims One (A) and Four \ndo not warrant habeas relief under\u00a7 2254(d), and the Court is convinced that \nreasonable jurists would not find these conclusions unreasonable. The Court also \nconcludes that Claims One (8)-(F), Two, and Three are procedurally barred from \nhabeas review, and is convinced that reasonable jurists would not find these \nconclusions unreasonable. Consequently, Petitioner has failed to make a substantial \nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right, and the Court will not issue a certificate of \nappealability. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the instant Petition must be \ndenied. An appropriate Order will be entered. \n71 "}
