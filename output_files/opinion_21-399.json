It explains the law and facts sup-\nporting the plaintiff\u2019s claims. Indeed, when ruling on a motion to dismiss, j udges can \nlook only at the complaint\u2019s allegations. The lawyers here seem to have forgotten \nthese ba sic principles . In support of his motion to dismiss, one defendant  relies on a \nwarrant not integral to the complaint.  And plaintiff Valentin uses her briefs to add \nfacts and recast her claims.  \nI cannot credit these efforts to circumvent the rules. And look ing only at the com-\nplaint, I must dismiss all claims against New Castle County and all but one claim \nagainst Officer Hewlett.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nOn a motion to dismiss, I take the facts alleged in the complaint as true. When \nClaribel Valentin bought a home, she r an into trouble with her neighbors . First Am. \nCompl., D.I. 6 \u00b6  1 They  disliked Valentin\u2019s Spanish -language music and repeatedly \ncomplained about the noise to the police. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 11 \u201314, 16, 18, 20\u2013 24. \nThe first thirteen times the police responded, they \u201cdetermined that\u201d Valentin \n\u201chad committed no crime or other violation.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 23. But after  the fourteenth call, \nthey reversed course . Id. \u00b6 25. Though they  did not hear the noise that had bedeviled  \nthe neighbors , they arrested Valentin for violating a county ordinance that  bans  \u201cun-\nreasonable noise. \u201d New Castle County , Delaware  Code \u00a7 22.02.006; First Am. Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 24\u201327, 69. Crucially, they did so without a warrant. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 28\u201332. The County \nnever prosecuted Valentin. Id.  \u00b6 36. 3 Fuming about her warrantless arres t, Valentin complained to  the police depart-\nment. Id. \u00b6 34. Though it found that the officers had breached department policy by \narresting her, Valentin was still unhappy. So she sued New Castle County, Hewlett, \nand the neighbors for civil -rights violations. D.I. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 35,  \nNow the County and Hewlett move to dismiss. D.I. 8, 16.  To survive, Valentin\u2019s \ncomplaint must prov ide enough facts to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Under that standard, Valentin\u2019s \ncomplaint  mostly falls short . Only her federal -law claims against Hewlett survive.  \nII. VALENTIN \u2019S STATE -LAW CLAIMS AGAINST OFFICER HEWLETT FAIL,  \nBUT HER FEDERAL CLAIMS DO NOT \nValentin sues Hewlett  for malicious prosecution , plus  false arrest and imprison-\nment , under both federal and state law . Only  her federa l claims may proceed.  \nA.  Valentin\u2019s federal false -arrest -and-imprisonment claim survives  \nValentin brings two counts alleging that Officer Hewlett wrongly arrested and \nimprisoned her. First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  59\u201366 (Count IV); id. \u00b6\u00b6 69\u201370 (Count V).  \nShe says th at both counts invoke \u00a7  1983 to allege  constitutional  violations.  Pls\u2019 Br., \nD.I. 23, at 12. But I cannot  read her complaint that way. Though Count V invokes \nfederal law, Count IV never mentions it. First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  59\u201366 (Count IV); id.  \n\u00b6\u00b6 69\u201370 (Count V). Read most naturally, Count IV alleges false arrest in violation of \nstate tort law. D.I. 17, at 16. So that is how I will assess it.  See Digene Corp. v. Stra-\ntegic Income Fund, LLC v. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Corp. , 305 F.3d 1293, 1295 & n.9 \n(11th Cir. 200 2). 4 1. State claim. Valentin\u2019s state -law false -arrest -and-imprisonment claim runs \nsmack into governmental immunity. Delaware generally gives \u201call governmental en-\ntities and their employees \u2026 immun[ity] from suit\u201d in their official capacities \u201con any \nand all  tort claims,\u201d including malicious prosecution. Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7  4011(a); \nsee Carr v. Dewey Beach , 730 F. Supp. 591, 602 (D. Del. 1990). True, employees may \nbe personally liable for acts \u201ccausing property damage, bodily injury or death\u201d if \u201cper-\nformed with wanton negligence or willful and malicious intent.\u201d Del. Code Ann. tit. \n10, \u00a7  4011(c). But that exception does not apply here.   \nShe does not properly allege that Hewlett \u201ccaus[ed] property damage, bodily in-\njury or death.\u201d Rather, he claims  that she suffered vague \u201cpain and suffering, embar-\nrassment, loss of reputation, [and] loss of enjoyment of the value of [her] home.\u201d First \nAm. Compl. \u00b6  66. But those allegations do not satisfy  the exception . See, e.g. , Wilcher \nv. Wilmington , 60 F. Supp. 2 d 298, 306\u2013 07 (D. Del. 1999) (holding that mental an-\nguish does not count as  a \u201cbodily injury\u201d).  \nNor does her claim that  she suffered \u201cbodily injury\u201d when Officer Hewlett  hand-\ncuffed her. First Am. Compl. \u00b6  66. That allegation is conclusory \u2014Valentin does not \nexplain what injuries, if any, she suffered. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. \n544, 557 (2007)  (\u201c[C]onclusory allegation[s] \u2026 do [] not supply facts adequate to [state  \na claim].\u201d). Because Valentin does not  overcome immunity, I dismiss her state -law \nclaim.  \n2. Federal claim. Valentin\u2019s federal claim fares better. To state a false -arrest -and-\nimprisonment claim under \u00a7  1983, she must show that Hewlett arrested and detained 5 her without probable cause. Groman v. Township of  Manalapan , 47 F.3d 628, 636 (3d \nCir. 1995). Hewlett would have had probable cause only if, \u201cat the moment the arrest \nwas made,\u201d he \u201chad reasonably trustworthy information\u201d to \u201cbeliev [e] that [Valentin] \nhad committed or was committing an offense.\u201d Beck v. Ohio , 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964).  \nBut the complaint suggests that he did not. Hewlett never heard the \u201cunreasona-\nble noise\u201d coming from her home. New Castle County Code \u00a7 22.02.006; First Am. \nCompl. \u00b6  64. He knew only that her neighbors had reported a noise . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201320. And \nthey had  baselessly reported her many times before. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 22\u221223.  \nWith the neighbors\u2019 track record of crying wolf, their word could not carry enough \nweight to justify arresting Valentin without corroborating evidence. Cf. Illinois v. \nGates, 462 U.S. 213, 227, 239 (1983). So Valentin has plausibly ple aded that Hewlett \narrested her without probable cause.  \nPushing back , Hewlett says he  listed facts justifying Valentin\u2019s arrest in an after -\nthe-fact warrant. See D.I. 17 -2, at 5. But  at this stage  I may \u201ctake judicial notice of \n[police records] \u2026 only to establish their existence \u2026 not for the truth of the matters asserted.\u201d Brown v. Evans, 2021 WL 4973630, at *3 (D. Del. Oct. 25, 2021). Looking \nto facts in the warrant to supply probable cause would \u201cundercut [Valentin\u2019s] com-\nplaint.\u201d  Id. So I may not consult the warrant yet.  \nB. Valentin\u2019s  federal  malicious -prosecution claims may proceed  \nValent in brings two claims alleging that Hewlett \u201cmaliciously initiat[ed] \u2026 [a] \ncriminal proceeding\u201d against her \u201cwithout probable cause.\u201d First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 70 \n(Count V) , 47\u201350 (Count II).  6 Again, Valentin says both claims rely on \u00a7  1983 to allege Fourth Amendment  vio-\nlations . D.I. 23, at 10 \u201311. Unlike Count V, Count II never says \u201c \u00a7 1983.\u201d Compare D.I. \n6, at 8, with id. at 12. Plus, reading Count II to rely on \u00a7  1983 would render Count V \nsuperfluous: both  would assert claims against Hewlett under \u00a7  1983.  Finally, if Count \nII relied on \u00a7 1983, it would fail to state a claim against the neighbors \u2014Valentin does \nnot allege that they were \u201cacting under the color of state law,\u201d as \u00a7 1983 requires. D.I. \n17, at 11.  So I will read Count II as stating a malicious -prosecution claim under Del-\naware law and Count V as stating a \u00a7  1983 claim.  \nLike her state false -arrest -and-imprisonment claim, Valentin\u2019s state -law mali-\ncious -prosecution claim is barred by governmental immunity  because she has not \nproperly alleged bodily injury . Carr, 730 F. Supp. at 602.  \nBut her  federal malicious -prosecution claim may proceed. \u201cTo [plead] malicious \nprosecution under \u00a7 1983, \u201d Valentin must allege that  Hewlett \u201cinitiated a criminal \nproceeding \u2026  maliciously or for a purpose other than bringing [her] to justice .\u201d \nKossler v. Crisanti , 564 F.3d 181, 186 (3d Cir. 2009).  \u201cMalice may be inferred from \nthe absence of probable cause. \u201d Lawson v . City of Coatesville, 42 F. Supp. 3d 664, 674 \nn.8 (E.D. Pa. 2014)  (quoting Lippay v.  Christos, 996 F.2d 1490, 1502 (3d Cir. 1993)) . \nAs I have explained, Hewlett lacked probable cause to arrest Valentin. And , Valentin \nsays, he \u201cknew probable cause did not exist to charge [her].\u201d Compl. \u00b6  32. If true, that \nshows a subjective \u201clack of belief \u2026 in the propriety of the prosecution .\u201d Lawson , 42 \nF. Supp. 3d at 674 n.8 . That is enough to state a claim.  7 C. Officer Hewlett is not yet entitled to qualified immunity  \nResisting liability, Officer Hewlett says  he is entitled to qualified immunity. D.I. \n17, at 19\u2013 20. But he does not meet his \u201cburden of establishing entitlement\u201d to im-\nmunity. Reedy v. Evanson , 615 F.3d 197, 223 (3d Cir. 2010). True, he recognizes that \nhe would be entitled to immunity if he \u201chad pr obable cause to arrest Valentin.\u201d D.I. \n17, at 20. Yet he offers no argument for why he should get immunity if he did not \nhave probable cause. It would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for me to grant immunity in re-\nsponse to that \u201ccursor[y]\u201d argument. Estate of Massey v.  City of Phila ., 118 F. Supp. \n3d 679, 693\u2013 94 (E.D. Pa. 2015).  \nIII. THE CLAIMS AGAINST NEW CASTLE COUNTY FAIL \nTurn to the County. Valentin offers two theories about how New Castle County \nviolated her federal civil rights. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  1983; see Monell v. Dep\u2019t of  Soc. Servs. , \n436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978). Both fail.  \nA. Valentin\u2019s custom -and-practice theory fails  \nValentin first suggests that \u201cthe New Castle County Police Department ha[s] a \ncustom and practice of allowing\u201d warrantless arrests for misdemeanors \u201coccurring \noutside of [the] police officer\u2019s presence.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 75. This, she says, violates Delaware \nlaw. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7  1904. But \u00a7  1983 protects against violations of federal \nright s. \u201c[W]hether her [ ] arrest was proper under Delaware law plays little ro le in \nthat inquiry.\u201d Jordan v. Town of Milton, 2013 WL 105319, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 3, 2013).  \nAlternatively, Valentin argues that  this practice violates \u201cthe Fourth Amend-\nment\u2019s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d First Am. Compl. \u00b6  75. \nBut even if it did,  she fails to show that the department\u2019s conduct was a policy or 8 practice. To show that , Valentin needs to point t o either \u201cwell -settled \u2026 conduct\u201d  or \n\u201cevidence of knowledge and acquiescence\u201d in that conduct \u201cby [ ] final policymakers.\u201d \nBolden v. City of Wilmington , 2019 WL 133314, at *3 (D. Del. Jan. 8, 2019) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). But she does not.  \nIndee d, Valentin never identifies a similar arrest . Instead , she implies that her \narrest must be evidence of a broader practice. But a \u201csingle incident violating a con-\nstitutional right\u201d can establish a practice  only if \u201cdone by [the] governmental [ entity\u2019s ] \nhighest policymaker,\u201d not a \u201clower[ -]level employee.\u201d  Fletcher v. O\u2019Donnell , 867 F.2d \n791, 793 (3d Cir. 1989).  And Officer Hewlett is certainly not the d epartment\u2019s highest \npolicymaker. Cf. Clemons v. New Castle Cty. , 2020 WL 5978343, at *7 (D. Del. Oct. 8. \n2020) (holding that a lieutenant colonel in the department is not the highest policy-\nmaker).  \nTrue, Valentin\u2019s complaint alleges that the New Castle Police Chief \u201chad actual \nknowledge\u201d of the misdemeanor arrest practice \u201cfrom \u2026 his more than two decades\u201d \non the job. First Am. Compl. \u00b6  77. But she does not support this conclusion. To the \ncontrary, she admits that the department found that her arrest was against  its \u201cpol-\nicy.\u201d Id. \u00b6 35. So her complaint does not plausibly allege a custom -or-practice  claim.  \nAgain, Valentin responds with argument s not in her complaint. S he says repeated \npolice investigations into  noise at her house reflect  a \u201cpolicy\u201d that violated her  \u201cpri-\nvacy and liberty interests ,\u201d including  \u201cfreedom of expression,\u201d and  deprived her of the \n\u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d D.I. 14, at 14. But her complaint never mentions those  \nclaim s, so she cannot add them  now. Zimmerman , 836 F.2d at 181.  9 She also argues that she need not describe a plausible custom or practice now \nbecause she is \u201centitled to develop a record\u201d later. D.I. 14, at 14. Not so.  To get to \ndiscovery, she must state a claim that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n678. And custom -or-practice claims that fail to describe a custom or practice are not \nplausible. See, e.g. , Hildebrand v. Allegheny C nty., 757 F.3d 99, 110 \u201311 (3d Cir. 2014). \nSo I must dismiss her claim. If she has evidence of a broader pattern , she may amend \nher complaint.  \nB. Valentin\u2019s inadequate -supervision claim fails \nFinally, Valentin alleges  that the County \u201cinadequately trained \u2026 [and] super-\nvised its officers\u201d  and \u201cfailed to adopt a needed policy \u201d regulating warrantless misde-\nmeanor arrests.  First Am. Compl. \u00b6  76. \nTo state a failure -to-supervise claim, Valentin \u201cmust show that [the County\u2019s]  fail-\nure amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of those affected.\u201d  \nForrest v. Parry , 930 F.3d 93, 106 (3d Cir. 2019).  Though the Third Circuit has not \nweighed in, several circuits have held that the right at issue must be clearly estab-\nlished. Lewis v. City of Phila ., 2020 WL 1683451, at *12 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 6, 2020) ( col-\nlecting cases). That makes sense. If a right is not clearly established, there are no \n\u201cclear constitutional guideposts for the [County] to follow in developing policy.\u201d  Id. \n(internal quotation marks omitted).   \nThat requirement kills Valentin\u2019s claim. The right to be free from warrantless ar-\nrests for misdemeanors occurring outside the arresting officer\u2019s presence is not clearly \nestablished. To the contrary, courts of appeals have uniformly rejected such a right. \nSee, e.g.,  Woods v. City of Chi. , 234 F.3d 979, 995 (7th Cir. 2000); Pyles v. Raisor, 60 10 F.3d 1211, 1215 (6th Cir. 1995); Fields v. City of S . Houston , 922 F.2d 1183, 1189 (5th \nCir. 1991) . So New Castle County could not be deliberately indifferent to it.  \nEven if there were such a right, Valentin acknowledges that the department tried  \nto stop officers from violating  it. Indeed, s he admits that Hewlett \u201cact [ed] \u2018outside of \ndepartment policy \u2019\u201d by arresting her.  First Am. Compl. \u00b6  35. That suggests that the \nCounty did \u201cadopt a needed policy.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 76. \nIn what is by now a familiar pattern, Valentin raises a new theory  in her brief . \nShe argues that Hewlett arrested her for violating a civil ordinance , not a criminal \none. D.I. 14, at 10\u221211.  And she says,  because civil infractions  do not justify warrant-\nless arrest s, the department\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d of arresting people who violate that ordinance  \nwas barred by the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 12; see also Okorie v. Crawford , 921 \nF.3d 430, 436 (5th Cir. 2019) (\u201c[P]robable cause \u2026 of a civil violation generally does \nnot allow warrantless arrest.\u201d).  But i f Valentin  wants me to address this argument , \nshe must  add it to  her complaint.  \n* * * * * \nValentin plausibly alleges that  Hewlett lacked probable cause to arrest her  or file \na criminal complaint against her. So I will let her \u00a7  1983 false -arrest -and-imprison-\nment and malicious -prosecution claim s proceed. But he r other theories fail. Her \nclaims against New Castle County stumble because she does not show that the \nCounty is deliberately indifferent to or has a custom of violating Fourth Amendment \nrights. And h er state -law claims against Hewlett fail because he is immune from suit. \nSo I dismiss them. If Valentin wants to try again, she must amend her complaint.
