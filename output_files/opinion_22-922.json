Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware. Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nNovember 21, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nANDREWS, Ut ple \u2014\n\nPlaintiff Regent Goddard, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in\nSmyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 3). He appears\npro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 7). Plaintiff\nrequests counsel. (D.I. 5). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nPlaintiff alleges deliberate indifference to serious medical needs under 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1983 and negligent and intentional infliction emotional distress under Delaware law.\n(Id. at 6). He alleges the violations are on-going without providing any dates. (/d. at 6).\nNamed Defendants include Warden Dana Metzger, Warden Robert May, Doctor Aduh,\nMedical Board & Many Others, Centurion Medical Department Janitor, Medical\nAdministrator Matthew Wooford, Medical Administrator Anthony Jacobs, Medical\nAdministrator Mr. Scott, the People who Sit on the Board, and Delaware Department of\nCorrection Commissioner Claire DeMatteis. (/d. at 1-5).\n\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory damages, requests counsel, and asks to be sent\n\nback to a federal prison in Springfield, Missouri. (/d. at 9).\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A\\(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Baill v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d /d.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\n2\n\n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\nasserted. See id. at 11.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. /qba/, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nMedical Claims. A prison official\u2019s \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical\n\nneeds of prisoners\u2019 is a kind of cruel and unusual punishment \u201cproscribed by the Eighth\n\n3\n\nAmendment.\u201d Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). See also Brown v. Plata,\n563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011) (when a prison deprives a prisoner of adequate medical care,\ncourts have a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth Amendment violation);\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (under the Eighth Amendment, prison\nofficials must ensure inmates receive adequate medical care). |\n\nIn order to set forth a cognizable claim, an inmate must allege (i) a serious\nmedical need and (ii) acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate deliberate\nindifference to that need. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 104; Rouse v. Plantier, 182\nF.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999). A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he knows that\na prisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to\navoid the harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. at 837. A \u201cprison official may manifest\ndeliberate indifference by intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care.\u201d\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 104-05. A \u201cfailure to provide adequate care .. . [that]\nwas deliberate, and motivated by non medical factors\u201d is actionable under the Eighth\nAmendment, but \"inadequate care [that] was a result of an error in medical judgment\u201d is\nnot. Durmer v. O\u2019Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n\u201cA prisoner does not have the right \u2018to choose a specific form of medical\ntreatment.\u201d Lasko v. Watts, 373 F. App\u2019x 196, 203 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Harrison v.\nBarkley, 219 F.3d 132, 138-40 (2d Cir. 2000)). An inmate\u2019s claims against members of\na prison medical department are not viable under \u00a7 1983 where the inmate receives\ncontinuing care, but believes that more should be done by way of diagnosis and\ntreatment and maintains that options available to medical personnel were not pursued\n\nA\n\non the inmate\u2019s behalf. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 107. In addition, allegations of\nmedical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a constitutional violation. See White\nv. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 108-09 (3d Cir. 1990); see also Daniels v. Williams, 474\nU.S. 327, 332-34 (1986) (negligence is not compensable as a constitutional\ndeprivation).\n\nAs pled, the allegations fail to state cognizable claims. The one paragraph that\nmentions Centurion does not state a claim. (D.I. 3 at J 1). It merely states that when\nCenturion\u2019 took over as the medical contract provider, Plaintiff notified it by letter of his\nmedical needs and explained his need for its help. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that after he wrote to Centurion, he spoke to Wooford and\nnothing was done, but does not state when this happened. (/d. at | 3). Plaintiff alleges\nthat he asked Dr. Aduh to check his cancer spot and she responded she would keep an\neye onit. (/d. at] 5). At some point after that, a biopsy determined the spot was\ncancer. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Aduh tried to be very caring until he \u201cwrote her\nup.\u201d (/d.) The allegations do not indicate when this occurred, and, in any event, the\nallegations do not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Administrator Scott questioned two nurses who \u201cquit after\nmessing up scheduling for [inmate] care.\u201d (/d.at 9). This does not state an Eighth\nAmendment claim.\n\n1 The Complaint alleges that medication was taken from Plaintiff on February 9, 2020,\nand he was left in serious pain. (/d. at { 2) This took place prior April 1, 2020, when\nCenturion became the health care provider.\n\n2 Plaintiff attached about 100 pages of grievances and their history to his complaint.\n\n(D.1. 3-1).\n5\n\nPlaintiff alleges that he notified Warden Metzger and Warden May of his situation\nand he was placed in S-1 Building for his protection. (/d. at 13). Again, this does not\nstate a claim for a violation of any constitutional right.\n\nSome allegations are directed to non-defendants (id. at J] 4, 8) while others do\nnot identify the individuals alleged of wrongdoing or when the wrongdoing occurred. (id.\nat 197 5, 6, 7, 10). Metzger and Jacobs are named as defendants, yet there are no\nallegations directed against them.\n\nThe Complaint does not state cognizable claims. It is possible, however, that\nPlaintiff may be able to state claims upon amendment. Therefore, the Complaint will be\ndismissed and Plaintiff will be given leave to amend.\n\nRequest for Counsel. Plaintiff seeks counsel on the grounds that he needs a\nlawyer as soon as possible, he does not have the assistance continue this case, it\nwould be unfair to deny his request, and he needs outside investigation. (D.I. 5).\n\nA pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or statutory\nright to representation by counsel.> See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d\nCir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993). However, representation\nby counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a finding that a\n\nplaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.\n\n\" 3See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of lowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989)\n(\u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7 1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling\nattorney to represent an indigent civil litigant, the operative word in the statute being\n\u201crequest.\u201d).\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of\nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in\ndeciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the\nmerits of the plaintiffs claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her case\nconsidering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon\nhim or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to\nwhich factual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue such\ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiffs capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and\n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony.\nSee Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at\n155-56. The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative. Tabron, 6 F.3d\nat 157.\n\nAt this point there is not a viable complaint and no defendant has been served.\nAlthough Plaintiff has been given leave to file an amended complaint, whether\nappointment of counsel is merited is premature at this point. Accordingly, Plaintiff's\nrequest for counsel will be denied without prejudice to renew.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny without prejudice to renew\nPlaintiffs request for counsel (D.I. 5); and (2) dismiss the Complaint as legally frivolous\nand for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(B)(i) & (ii) and 1915A(b)(1). Plaintiff will be given leave to file an amended\n\ncomplaint.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nREGENT GODDARD,\nPlaintiff,\nv. ; Civil Action No. 22-922-RGA\nCENTURION MEDICAL DEP'T, etal.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 21st day of November, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the\nmemorandum opinion issued this date;\n\nIT iS ORDERED that:\n\n1. Plaintiff's request for counsel (D.1. 5) is DENIED without prejudice to\nrenew.\n\n2. The Complaint is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)\nand (ii) and 1915A(b)(1).\n\n3. Plaintiff is given leave to file an amended complaint on or before\n\nDecember 12, 2022. The case will be closed should Plaintiff fail to timely file an\n\nfo\nUNITED STA ZA yl JUDGE\n\namended complaint.\n"}
