IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCivil Action No. 21-1268-GBW \nDefendant. \nRobert Karl Beste, III, Jason Z. Miller, SMITH, KATZENSTEIN, & JENKINS LLP, \nWilmington, Delaware \nCounsel for Plaintiff \nAnthony David Raucci, Donna Lynn Culver, MORRIS, NICHOLS, ARSHT & TUNNELL LLP, \nWilmington , Delaware \nCounsel for Defendant \nSeptember 12, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION ' GREGORYB. WILLIAMS \nU.S. DISTRICT nJDGE \nPlaintiff James Bailey filed this action against Defendant Tektronix , Inc. (Tektronix ) to \nrecover funds owed to him in connection with Tektronix's acquisition of Bailey's company, \nInitial State Technologies , Inc. (IST). D.I. 12 ,r,r 1, 5. Bailey's Amended Complaint (the \nComplaint , D.I. 12) alleges breach of contract, violation of Delaware 's implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing, and violation of Oregon wage laws. Pending before the Court is \nTektronix's Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint for Failure to State a Claim (D.I. 14). \nUnder one provision of an agreement between the parties, Tektronix must compensate Bailey \nbased on sales of products and services that use IST's intellectual property. D.I. 16-1 at A2, A3. \nTektronix argues this provision should be read narrowly. D.I. 15 at 3. Bailey argues that it \nshould be read broadly. D.I. 19 at 1-2. Because a broad reading is plausible , the Court will deny \nin part Tektronix's Motion. \nI. BACKGROUND1 \nBailey, a Tennessee resident, founded IST in 2012. D.I. 12 ,r,r 3, 5. IST's intellectual \nproperty included software products used \"to send data from web-connected devices, sensors, \nand applications ... to a reliable, secure, scalable cloud .... \" D.I. 12 ,r 5. Tektronix is an \nOregon corporation registered to do business in Delaware . D.I. 12 ,r 4. In 2017, Tektronix \nsought to acquire IST to use IST's intellectual property \"in the oscilloscopes Tektronix \nmanufactured .... Notably, Tektronix was not interested in IST's existing software product and \nusers.\" D.I. 12 ,r 6. Tektronix explains, and Bailey does not contest, that \n1 Under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all factual allegations in the Complaint and \nview those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Fed Trade Comm 'n v. Abb Vie \nInc, 976 F.3d 327, 351 (3d Cir. 2020). \n1 [ a ]n oscilloscope is an instrument that graphically displays electrical \nvoltage signals as a function of time. Tektronix has been selling \noscilloscopes since its founding in 1946. A multimeter is an \ninstrument that typically can measure electrical voltage, resistance, \nand current. Multimeters have been in use for nearly a century. \nD.I. 15 at 13 n.7. \nOn January 5, 2018, IST and Tektronix entered an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \nMerger Agreement , D.I. 16-1, Ex. B) that merged IST into Tektronix. D.I. 12 ,r,r 7-8. The \nparties simultaneousl y entered a Retention Holdback Agreement (the RHA, D.I. 16-1, Ex. A) \nthat withheld up to $800,000 in funds Bailey would have received in connection with the merger \n(the Retention Holdback Amount). D.I. 12 ,r 9; D.I. 16-1 at Al. The $800,000 included \n$740,000 \"that would otherwise be payable to [Bailey] as a holder of [1ST] Common Stock\" and \n$60,000 that constituted Bailey's share of an \"Escrow Fund\" created to compensate Tektronix \nfor certain \"indemnification claims\" available to it under the Merger Agreement. D.I. 16-1 at \nAl, B26. \nThe RHA provides that \n[n]o later than January 15, 2021, [Bailey] will be paid an amount in \ncash, which amount will not exceed the Retention Holdback \nAmount, equal to 20% of each dollar of Revenue, but only if \n[Bailey] (i) is continuousl y employed by [Tektronix] from the \nClosing Date through December 31, 2020 .... \nD.I. 16-1 at A2; D.I. 1 ,r 9. The RHA defines \"Revenue\" as \neach dollar of gross revenue in excess of $6,000,000 (but ... less \nthan or equal to $10,000,000) generated during 2020 by [Tektronix] \nfrom or with respect to any software that contains any of the \nintellectual property owned by [IST] as of the Closing Date. \nD.I. 16-1 at A3; D.I. 1 ,r 9. While the RHA does not further discuss \"intellectual property ,\" the \nMerger Agreement and its disclosure schedules show that IST solely owned only four patents \nfiled on August 2, 2016. D.I. 16-1 at BIO, B46, CS, C18. \n2 Tektronix \"implemented\" IST's intellectual property in two places: First, Tektronix \n\"heavily leveraged existing IST infrastructure and intellectual property\" in its Marshall Module; \nTektronix used the Marshall Module both to \"connect Tektronix's oscilloscopes to the cloud\" \nand as part of software that supports oscilloscope operation. D.I. 12 ,r,r 14-16. Tektronix also \nincorporated IST's intellectual property into ''the software operating the Keithley DAQ \n6500/6510 Data Acquisition and Logging, Multimeter System\" (the Keithley System). D.I. 12 ,r \n17. The Keithley System is a digital multimeter that, according to Tektronix's website, allows \nusers to \"[s]tream and log data to secure cloud-based data visualizations[ .]\" DAQ6510 Data \nAcquisition and Logging, Multimeter System, Tektronix (Accessed September 6, 2022), \nhttps://www.tek.com/en/products/k:eithley /digital-multimeter/k:eithley-daq6510. \nBailey alleges that, \nthe oscilloscopes and devices in which IST's intellectual property \nwas incorporated ( whether such intellectual property is essential or \nnecessary to operate such oscilloscopes) earned far more than \n$10,000,000 in gross revenue in 2020. \nD.I. 12 ,r,r 13, 21. The RHA's section on tax reporting states that the parties \nagree (a) to treat any payment of the Retention Holdback Amount to \n[Bailey] as payment made in exchange for [Bailey]'s [1ST] \nCommon Stock ... and not as compensation for services and (b) to \nreport for income Tax purposes any payment of the Retention \nHoldback Amount to [Bailey] as consideration for [Bailey]' s [1ST] \nCommon Stock ... and not as compensation for services .... \nD.I. 16-1 at A3. \nAfter Tektronix acquired IST, Bailey joined Tektronix as an employee and was told to \nfocus \"all efforts ... to the further development of software to be sold fully integrated in \nTektronix's core business line[,] which is mixed signal oscilloscopes .\" D.I. 12 ,r 19. Tektronix \n3 employed Bailey through May 21, 2021; Bailey visited Tektronix's headquarters to perform \nwork six times per year, and he stayed for several days at a time each time. D.I. 12 ,r,r 12, 22. \nTektronix failed to repay the entire $800,000 that Bailey claims he is owed under the \nRHA by January 15, 2021. Thereafter , Bailey filed and then voluntarily withdrew a breach of \ncontract claim in Delaware state court and then filed an initial complaint before this Court on \nSeptember 3, 2021. D.I. 1; D.I. 15 at 2; D.I. 19 at 1. After Tektronix moved to dismiss, D.I. 6, \nBailey withdrew his initial complaint and filed the Complaint on November 17, 2021. D.I. 12; \nD.I. 19 at 1. \nBailey's Complaint sounds in three counts: breach of the RHA; violation of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law; and violation of Oregon Revised \nStatute \u00a7 652.150, a statute that imposes penalties on employers that \"willfully fail\u008f to pay any \nwages or compensation to any employee .... \" D.I. 12 ,r,r 23--49. Tektronix moves to dismiss \nthe Complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 12(b )( 6). D .I. 14. The motion is fully briefed, and no hearing is necessary. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2). Such a claim must plausibly suggest \"facts sufficient to 'draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"' Doe v. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th 335, \n342 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)) (citing Bell At!. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.\"' Klotz v. Celentano Stadtmauer & Walentowicz LLP, 991 F.3d 458, \n462 (3d Cir. 2021) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). But the Court will \"'disregard legal \n4 conclusions and recitals of the elements of a cause of action supported by mere conclusory \nstatements. \"' Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th at 342 (quoting Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333,341 \n(3d Cir. 2016)). \n\"'The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' Pinnavaia v. Celotex Asbestos Settlement Tr., \n271 F. Supp. 3d 705, 708 (D. Del. 2017) (quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 \nF.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997)), affd, 2018 WL 11446482 (3d Cir. Apr. 6, 2018). Rule \n12(b )( 6) requires the court to accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them \nin the light most favorable to plaintiff. AbbVie Inc, 976 F.3d at 351. The court may consider \nmatters of public record and documents attached to, \"integral to[,] or explicitly relied upon in\" \nthe complaint. Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241,249 (3d Cir. 2014) (cleaned up); see also \nSpizzirri v. Zyla Life Scis., 802 F. App'x 738, 739 (3d Cir. 2020) (same). \"A motion to dismiss \n'may be granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and \nviewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\"' McCrone \nv. Acme Markets, 561 F. App'x 169, 172 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Burlington Coat Factory, 114 \nF.3d at 1420). \nIII. DISCUSSI ON \nA plausible reading of revenue generated \"from or with respect to any software that \ncontains any of the intellectual property owned by [IST,]\" D.I. 16-1 at A3, could include revenue \ntied to the sale of all products that include the software at issue. Thus, the Court will deny \nTektronix's Motion to Dismiss as to the breach of contract allegation. The Court will grant \nTektronix's Motion as to Bailey's other claims: Bailey fails to state a claim for violation of \nDelaware's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the implied covenant does \nnot cover express contractual rights. Bailey also fails to state a claim for violation of Oregon \n5 wage laws, since the RHA does not treat the Retention Holdback Amount as compensation for \nservices. \nA. Breach of Contract \nWhether the RHA's \"Revenue\" definition reaches beyond sales of software is ambiguous \nat this stage. Thus, Bailey's breach of contract claim may go forward. \nTue parties agree that the RHA should be interpreted under Delaware law. See D.I. 15 at \n11 & n.6; D.I. 16-1 at A4; D.I. 19 at 10 (applying Delaware law). Delaware law, as the \nDelaware Supreme Court explained earlier this year, requires \nplaintiffs [to] establish the following three elements to succeed on a \nbreach of contract claim: (1) the existence of a contract, whether \nexpress or implied; (2) breach of one or more of the contract's \nobligations; and (3) damages resulting from the breach. \nGEICO Gen. Ins. Co. v. Green, 276 A.3d 462 (Del. 2022) (footnote omitted). Here, the \nexistence of the RHA and damages-failure to make payments due under the RHA-are \nuncontested. At issue is whether Tektronix breached the RHA. \nWhen interpreting a contract, Delaware courts seek to \"fulfill the 'parties' shared \nexpectations at the time they contracted\"' and '\"interpret clear and unambiguous terms according \nto their ordinary meaning\"' based on how \"'an objective, reasonable third party\"' would \nunderstand a contract's terms. Leaf Invenergy Co. v. Invenergy Renewables LLC, 210 A.3d 688, \n696 (Del. 2019) ( citations omitted); see also Cox Commc 'ns, Inc. v. T-Mobile US, Inc., 2022 WL \n619700, at *5 (Del. Mar. 3, 2022) (\"[Delaware's] approach places great weight on the plain \nterms of a disputed contractual provision .... \"). Delaware courts construe contracts \"as a whole \nand ... give each provision and term effect, so as not to render any part ... mere surplusage .\" \nUnited States v. Sanofi-Aventis US LLC, 226 A.3d 1117, 1129 (Del. 2020) (internal quotations \nand citations omitted). \n6 Sources outside the four corners of a contract may shed light on the contract's meaning. \n\"Delaware courts look to dictionaries for assistance in determining the plain meaning of terms \nwhich are not defined in a contract.\" Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Am. Legacy Found, 903 A.2d \n728, 738 (Del. 2006) (citations omitted). Delaware courts impose a \"rule that related \ncontemporaneous documents should be read together .... \" Ashall Homes Ltd v. ROK Ent. Grp. \nInc., 992 A.2d 1239, 1250 (Del. Ch. 2010) (collecting authorities). \nTerms, of course, do not always have one plain and unambiguous meaning. \n[Delaware courts] do not consider extrinsic evidence unless [they] \nfind that the text is ambiguous. Ambiguity is present \"only when \nthe provisions in controversy are reasonably or fairly susceptible of \ndifferent interpretations or may have two or more different \nmeanings.\" Critically , a contractual provision is \"not rendered \nambiguous simply because the parties in litigation differ\" as to the \nproper interpretation. \nCox Commc'ns, 2022 WL 619700, at *5 (citations omitted). \nTektronix agreed in the RHA to pay Bailey \"20% of each dollar of Revenue,\" D.I. 16-1 at \nA2, and the RHA defines \"Revenue\" as \neach dollar of gross revenue in excess of $6,000,000 ... generated \nduring 2020 by [Tektronix] from or with respect to any software \nthat contains any of the intellectual property owned by [1ST] as of \nthe Closing Date. \nD.I. 16-1 at A3 (emphasis added). Tektronix argues that \"revenue must be tied to the sale or \nlicense of software-whether that be subscription revenue or technical support relating to use of \nthe cloud-based software platform.\" D.I. 15 at 13. Tekronix further offers that Bailey should \nreceive credit for the software component of products that integrate hardware and software. D.I. \n21 at 5. Bailey argues that \"Revenue\" \"covers revenue from any device sold by the company \nthat uses or implements the intellectual property in any way whatsoever .... \" D .I. 19 at 11. \n7 Bailey argues in the alternative that the existence of two plausible interpretations means the issue \ncannot be resolved on the pleadings. D .I. 19 at 12. \nThe Court first looks to how the parties use the phrase at issue elsewhere in the RHA. \nNeither the RHA nor the Merger Agreement repeat the phrase \"from or with respect to.\" The \nRHA uses \"with respect to\" three other times, as follows: \n[The RHA], the Merger Agreement , and the documents and \ninstruments and other agreements that are referenced herein or in the \nMerger Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the \nparties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all \nprior and contemporaneous agreements , arrangements , \ncommunications , and understandings , both written and oral, among \nthe parties with respect to the subject matter hereof ( other than any \nnon-competition or non-solicitation agreement executed by [Bailey] \nprior to the date of [the RHA] for the benefit of [Tektronix]) .... \n. . . No waiver by any party with respect to any condition , default, \nor breach of covenant hereunder will be deemed to extend to any \nprior or subsequent condition , default or breach of covenant \nhereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any \nsuch occurrence. \nD.I. 16-1 at A4--A5 (emphases added). The combination of \"with respect to\" and \"any\" in the \nthird example, but not in the first two, suggests that the parties intended to give \"with respect to\" \na broader scope when they add \"any.\" \nThe Court also turns to the Merger Agreement for assistance understanding the RHA \nbecause the parties executed the RHA \"as a material inducement to the willingness of \n[Tektronix] to enter into the Merger Agreement .... \" D.I. 16-1 at Al. The Merger Agreement \nrequired IST to agree that the performance or execution of the Merger Agreement would not \n\"result in, or give any other Person the right or option to cause or declare: ... a reduction of any \nroyalties or other payments [IST] would be entitled to with respect to any Company IP [i.e., \nintellectual property \"in which [IST] has any right, title or interest,\" D.I. 16-1 at B41] .... \" D.I. \n8 16-1 at B 11 ( emphasis added). In context, an objective reader of this provision would find that it \napplies to a broad scope ofIST's intellectual property. \nThe RHA uses the term \"software\" only in its \"Revenue\" definition and does not further \ndefine the term. D.I. 16-1 at A3. The Merger Agreement uses the word \"software\" in its \ndefinitions of \"Computer Software ,\" \"Open Source Materials ,\" and \"Technology .\" D.I. 16-1 at \nB42, B45, B47. \"Computer Software \" includes \"software manufacturing instructions. \" D.I. 16-\n1 at B42. \"Open Source Materials \" include \"any software that (1) contains ... any software that \nis distributed as free software, [or] open source software .... \" D.I. 16-1 at B45. The definition \nof \"Technology \" includes \"software\" in a list with, among other terms, \"products, tools, devices, \n... algorithms , methods, processes , ... user interfaces, ... inventions ( whether or not \npatentable) , invention disclosures , [and] discoveries .... \" D.I. 16-1 at B47. None of these \nprovisions define \"software, \" though the \"Technology\" definition distinguishes \"software \" from \n\"products\" and \"devices.\" \nDictionary definitions provide additional guidance as to how \"a reasonable person in the \nposition of a party to a contract\" would understand \"the ordinary meaning\" of a contract's terms. \nLorillard Tobacco, 903 A.2d at 738. Merriam Webster's Unabridged Dictionary-in the \ndefinition of \"respect\"-states that \"with respect to\" means \"as regards,\" \"insofar as concerns ,\" \nand \"with reference to.\" Respect, Merriam-Webster 's Unabridged Dictionary (Accessed May 2, \n2022), https ://unabridged.merriam-webster .com/unabridged/respect. \"Software\" means \n\"something used or associated with and usually contrasted with hardware .\" Software, Merriam\u00ad\nWebster's Unabridged Dictionary (Accessed May 2, 2022), https://unabridged.merriam\u00ad\nwebster .com/unabridged/ software. \n9 After examining the RHA, the Merger Agreement , and dictionary definitions , Bailey is \ncorrect that two readings of the phrase \"from or with respect to any software\" are plausible. The \nordinary, objective meaning of \"gross revenue ... generated ... from ... any software\" includes \nrevenue from direct software sales. To avoid a reading that renders \"with respect to\" mere \nsurplusage , the Court must construe \"gross revenue ... generated ... with respect to any \nsoftware\" to extend beyond such direct sales. However, nothing in the RHA clarifies whether \nthe \"Revenue\" definition includes sales of hardware that contains the software at issue or only \nsoftware and services sold therewith . While the ordinary meaning of software contrasts with that \nof hardware , the use of \"with respect to\" suggests the drafters intended to capture revenue that \nrefers to or \"concerns\" \"any\" of the referenced software, a broad reading that would include \nrelated hardware. Also, the facts alleged in the pleadings point to Bailey's broader reading as the \nbetter one: Tektronix sought to acquire 1ST to use IST's intellectual property \"in the \noscilloscopes Tektronix manufactured .\" D.I. 12 ,r 6. Bailey, as a Tektronix employee , was told \nto focus \"all efforts ... to the further development of software to be sold fully integrated in ... \nmixed signal oscilloscopes .\" D.I. 12 ,r 19. A \"Revenue\" provision capable of two plausible \nreadings is ambiguous . \nTektronix offers three responses , but none of them are availing. First, Tektronix argues \nthat the Merger Agreement 's disclosure schedules show that \"the only intellectual property that \n1ST owned related to a software as a service platform .... \" D.I. 15 at 13. Tektronix could \nhave-and allegedly did-use that software in its oscilloscopes and multimeters. Bailey alleges \nthat these products \"are equal parts hardware and software.\" D.I. 12 ,r 18. \nSecond, Tektronix argues that \"(i]t would be illogical for the parties to tie the Revenue \ncondition to all revenue from sales of oscilloscopes or multimeters , or any other device, whose \n10 core functions were developed by Tektronix , or others, long before the acquisition ofIST.\" D.I. \n15 at 14. Tektronix also argues that \"none of the software acquired from [IST] in 2018 enabled \nTektronix to sell [] oscilloscopes. \" D.I. 21 at 4. Bailey alleges that Tektronix 's devices required \nsoftware to function. D.I. 1 ,r,r 18-19. IfIST's intellectual property improved Tektronix 's \nexisting products, Tektronix could logically credit Bailey with twenty percent of those products' \nsales. To the extent Tektronix alleges facts that differ from those in the Complaint, the Court \nmay not credit them at this stage of the action. \nThird, Tektronix argues that, because the Merger Agreement defines '\"Computer \nSoftware' without reference to devices\" but defines \"'Technology ' as including devices,\" the \nparties \"understood the difference between tying the Revenue condition to software specifically \nas opposed to tying it more broadly to Tektronix 's products containing software .... \" D.I. 15 at \n15; see also D.I. 21 at 4 (\"[T]he agreements show that the parties knew how to draft the Revenue \ncondition to include revenue from devices if that was the intent.\"). The Court agrees with \nTektronix that the Merger Agreement differentiates hardware and software. However , Bailey \nalleges that Tektronix 's hardware incorporates software that IST improved . \nBoth parties assert a plausible reading of \"gross revenue ... generated ... from or with \nrespect to any software\" that contains IST's intellectual property: Tektronix may derive such \nrevenue from sales of software and related products, alone, or also from hardware that includes \nthe software at issue. Thus, the phrase is ambiguous , and the external evidence available at this \nstage points to Bailey's broader reading that includes hardware. Bailey alleges \"upon \ninformation and belief' that \"oscilloscopes and devices in which IST's intellectual property was \nincorporated ... earned far more than $10,000,000 in gross revenue in 2020.\" D.I. 12 ,r 21. \nSince 20% of the difference between $10 million and $6 million equals $800,000, Bailey has \n11 stated a claim, at least at this early stage, that he is entitled to receive the entire Revenue \nHoldback Amount. \nB. Delaware's Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \nBailey further alleges that Tektronix used the \"Revenue\" definition \"to avoid paying Mr. \nBailey the Retention Holdback Amount\" and, thus, \"has acted in bad faith, with an improper \nmotive and has unfairly dealt with Mr. Bailey.\" D.I. 12137. However , Bailey fails to allege \nfacts that support a plausible claim for violation of Delaware 's implied covenant of good faith \nand fair dealing here. \nDelaware's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing '\"cannot be invoked to \noverride the express terms of the contract.'\" Edinburgh Holdings , Inc. v. Educ. Affiliates, Inc., \n2018 WL 2727542, at *9 (Del. Ch. June 6, 2018) (quoting Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, L.L.C., 971 \nA.2d 872, 888 (Del. Ch. 2009)). Rather, for a plaintiff to state a claim for breach of the implied \ncovenant, the plaintiff \"'must allege a specific implied contractual obligation, a breach of that \nobligation by the defendant , and resulting damage to the plaintiff.\"' Kuroda, 971 A.2d at 888 \n( citation omitted). In Kuroda, the Court of Chancery found that an implied covenant claim \n\"premised on the failure of defendants to pay money due under the contract ... must fail because \nthe express terms of the contract will control such a claim.\" Id.; see also In re Nat'! Collegiate \nStudent Loan Trusts Litig., 251 A.3d 116, 196 (Del. Ch. 2020) (\"[T]he implied covenant is ... \nused to infer contractual terms to which the parties would have agreed had they anticipated a \nsituation they failed to address.\" (internal quotations and citation omitted)). \nBailey argues that he \"was justified in his expectation that, under the terms of the RHA, \nrevenue from the sale of all products incorporating software containing IST' s intellectual \nproperty would count towards the achievement of Revenue as defined by the RHA.\" D.I. 19 at \n12 15. Bailey added that \"he would not have agreed to the terms of the RHA, as Tektronix now \npurports to understand them .... \" D.I. 19 at 15. In other words, Bailey argues that Tektronix \nacted in bad faith because Tektronix breached the RHA. However, Bailey admits that the \nimplied covenant \"is invoked only where the contract is silent with respect to the issue in \ndispute.\" D.I. 19 at 14 (internal quotations and citation omitted). In short, the only contractual \nobligation Bailey invokes is an express obligation , not an implied obligation , and Bailey must \nallege an implied obligation to invoke the implied covenant. Kuroda, 971 A.2d at 888. Thus, \nthe Court will dismiss Bailey's claim for violation of Delaware 's implied covenant of good faith \nand fair dealing. \nC. Oregon Wage Law Violations \nThe Court will also dismiss Bailey's claims under Oregon's wage statutes because the \nparties agreed that the Retention Holdback Amount was compensation for Bailey's ownership of \nIST, not for Bailey's work on behalf of Tektronix. \nOregon law provides that, \nif an employer willfully fails to pay any wages or compensation of \nany employee whose employment ceases, ... then, as a penalty for \nthe nonpayment , the wages or compensation of the employee shall \ncontinue from the due date thereof at the same hourly rate for eight \nhours per day until paid or until action therefor is commenced. \nOr. Rev. Stat.\u00a7 652.150(1). To recover, Bailey must show that he was an employee and that \nTektronix failed to pay Bailey \"wages or compensat ion.\" \nTektronix argues that Bailey does not qualify as an \"employee \" under Oregon law, since \nBailey worked primarily in Tennessee and \"it is not apparent\" that Bailey's contract for \nemployment was made in Oregon. D.I. 21 at 10. Bailey alleges that he performed on-site work \nfor Tektronix in Oregon and that he \"performed work for Tektronix in Oregon remotely from his \n13 home.\" D.I. 12140. Since neither party has submitted Bailey's employment agreement with \nTektronix , the allegations in the Complaint require that the Court reject Tektronix's argument. \nSection 652.150 does not define \"wages or compensation, \" so the Court turns to the \nstatute's \"ordinary meaning. \" White v. Jubitz Corp., 182 P.3d 215, 217 (Or. App. 2008), aff'd, \n219 P.3d 566 (Or. 2009). The Oregon Court of Appeals found that \"wages\" \"is commonly \nunderstood to encompass compensation for labor or services.\" Wyatt v. Body Imaging, P. C., 989 \nP.2d 36, 4~1 (Or. App. 1999); see also Hekker v. Sabre Const. Co., 510 P.2d 347,351 (Or. \n1973) (holding that\u00a7 652.200 extends to commissions and noting that\u00a7 652.150 is broader). \nSection 652.210-a section adjacent to\u00a7 652.150 that relates to discriminatory wage practices, \nsee Lamy v. Jack Jarvis & Co., 574 P.2d 1107, 1111 (Or. 1978) (using\u00a7 652.210 to assist in \nconstruing the term \"employee \" under \u00a7 652.150Hefines \"wages\" as \"all compensation for \nperformance of service by an employee for an employer .... \" Or. Rev. Stat.\u00a7 652.210(14 ). \nThe same section states that \"compensation \" includes \"wages, salary, bonuses, benefits, fringe \nbenefits and equity-based compensation. \" Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 652.210(1)(a). Employers pay each \nform of compensation in exchange for services. Indeed, the penalty for failure to pay \"wages or \ncompensation \" in \u00a7 652.150( 1) is that \"the wages or compensation of the employee shall \ncontinue[,]\" and it makes little sense to \"continue\" compensation unless the compensation is \nproportional to the services rendered (e.g., hourly wages). In short, \"wages and compensation \" \nrefers only to remuneration for services. \nHere, the RHA requires Bailey to maintain employment with Tektronix to receive the \nRetention Holdback Amount. D.I. 16-1 at A2. However, the RHA provides that Tektronix and \nBailey \"agree (a) to treat any payment of the Retention Holdback Amount to [Bailey] as payment \nmade in exchange for [Bailey]'s [IST] Common Stock ... and not as compensation for services \n14 .... \" D.I. 16-1 at A3. Bailey argues that this provision was limited to income tax reporting , \nD.I. 19 at 17, but the relevant provision separately specifies the parties' obligations \"to treat\" and \n\"to report\" the Retention Holdback Amount as compensation for stock and not for services. D.I. \n16-1 at A3. In fact, most of the Retention Holdback Amount is $740,000 \"that would otherwise \nbe payable to [Bailey] as a holder of [IST] Common Stock at Closing .... \" D.I. 16-1 at Al.2 \nBailey cites to an Oregon case that suggests compensation similar to that contained in the \nRHA may be compensation for services rendered. D.I. 19 at 16 ( citing Pollock v. D.R. Horton, \nInc.-Portland , 77 P.3d 1120 (Or. App. 2003)). However, that case is distinguishable because it \nwas premised on the breach of Oregon's implied covenant of good faith, not on Oregon's wage \nlaws, and because the Oregon Court of Appeals never made a finding that the \"earn out\" at issue \nwas compensation for services rendered. Pollock, 77 P.3d at 1129 . \u2022 \nBailey fails to allege sufficient facts to show that the Retention Holdback Amount \nconstituted \"wages or compensation \" under \u00a7 652.150. The RHA tied the Retention Holdback \nAmount to IST stock ownership , and Tektronix could not \"continue\" such a fixed lump sum \npayment, as \u00a7 652.150 requires. For those reasons, the Court will dismiss Bailey's claim for \nviolation of Oregon's wage laws. \n2 The Retention Holdback Amount also includes up to $60,000 \"withheld from any amounts \npayable to [Bailey] from the Escrow Fund .... \" D.I. 16-1 at Al. The Merger Agreement \nrequires contributions to the \"Escrow Fund\" on behalf of former IST stockholders. Amounts that \nremained in the \"Escrow Fund\" after Tektronix received all compensation due to it would be \ndivided among the stockholders based on the proportion of total IST stock they owned. D.I. 16-1 \nat B23, B28, B43. So that $60,000, too, is tied to stock ownership , not employment. \n15 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will deny Tektronix 's Motion to Dismiss as to Bailey's \nbreach of contract claim. The Court will grant the Motion as to Bailey's claims for violation of \nDelaware's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and of Oregon's wage laws. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) requires the Court to \"freely give leave [to \namend] when justice so requires.\" But dismissal with prejudice for futility is appropriate when \n\"'the complaint , as amended, would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\"' \nTravelers Indem. Co. v. Dammann & Co., 594 F.3d 238, 243 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). \nHere, Bailey's claim for violation of Delaware 's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \narises from the breach of an express contractual provision, D.I. 12, 35; however, no claim for a \nviolation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing lies where \"the express terms of \nthe contract will control such a claim.\" Kuroda, 971 A.2d at 888. The RHA provides that \nTektronix paid the Retention Holdback Amount \"in exchange for [Bailey]'s [1ST] Common \nStock ... and not as compensation for services .... \" D.I. 16-1 at A3. Bailey cannot sustain a \nclaim for failure to pay compensation for services rendered under Oregon law. No additional \nfactual allegations-provided that they are consistent with the RHA and the Merger \nAgreement--could make either claim one on which relief can be granted. Both claims should be \ndismissed with prejudice. \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n16 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJAMES BAILEY, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nTEKTRONIX, Inc. \nDefendant. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 12th day of September 2022: Civil Action No. 21-1268-GBW \nFor the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion issued this day, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that Defendant Tektronix, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint for \nFailure to State a Claim (D.I. 14) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART: \n1. The Motion is DENIED as to Count 1; \n2. The Motion is GRANTED as to Count 2 and as to Count 3; and \n3. Count 2 and Count 3 are dismissed with prejudice. \nGREGORY B.
