The Court carefully reviewed all submissions in connection \nwith the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the disputed claim terms, heard oral argument ( see D.I. 141) \nand applied the following l egal standards in reaching its decision. \n  3 I. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Claim Construction  \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n135 S. Ct. 831, 837- 38 (2015).  \u201c [T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a p erson of ordinary skill \nin the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent \napplication.\u201d   Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks  omitted).  Although \u201c the claims themselves provide substantial \nguidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms, \u201d the context of the surrounding words of the \nclaim also must be considered.  Id.  at 1314.  \u201c [T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d   Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201c is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning  of a disputed term.\u201d   Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, \nInc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201c the specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess.  In such cases, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs. \u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201c Even when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of \nthe patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d   Hill- Rom \nServs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flars heim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  4 In addition to the specification, a court \u201c should also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d   Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201c intrinsic evidence, \n. . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and Trademark \nOffice] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent. \u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d \nat 1317. \u201c [T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by \ndemonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.\u201d  Id. \nIn some cases, courts \u201c will need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\u201d   Teva , 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \u201c consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and le arned treatises. \u201d  Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201c to ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical \naspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.\u201d   \nPhillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201c expert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigat ion and thus can suffer \nfrom bias that is not present in intrinsic evidence. \u201d  Id.  Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201c may \nbe useful to the court,\u201d  it is \u201cless reliable \u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201c is unlikely \nto result in a reliable  interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the \nintrinsic evidence. \u201d  Id. at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope 5 of the patented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  Se e Pitney Bowes, Inc. \nv. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nII. THE COURT\u2019S RULING  \nThe Court\u2019s rulings regarding the disputed claim terms of the \u2019 673, \u2019117, \u2019337, \u2019349, and \n\u2019549 Patent s were announced  from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing as follows:  \n. . . At issue we have six patents in two patent families and four terms \nthat are the subject of dispute between Plaintiffs and the Apotex \ndefendants.[1]  \n \nI am prepared to rule on each of the disputes.  I will not be \nissuing a written opinion, but I will issue an order stating my rulings.  I want to emphasize before I announce my decisions that although I am not issuing a written opinion, we have followed a full and thorough process before making the decisions I am about to state.   I \nhave reviewed the pate nts in dispute.  I have also reviewed the \nportions of the prosecution history, the expert declaration and the other references submitted.  There was full briefing on each of the \ndisputed terms and Intercept submitted a technology tutorial.  We \nhave also ha d argument here today.  All of that has been carefully \nconsidered.  \n As to my rulings, I am not going to read into the record my \nunderstanding of claim construction law.  I have a legal standard \nsection that I have included in earlier opinions, including s omewhat \nrecently in Roche Diabetes Care, Inc. v. Insulet Corp., C.A. No. 20-825.  I incorporate that law and adopt it into my ruling today and \nwill also set it out in the order that I issue.  \n Neither party has suggested any differences in the definitions \nof a person of ordinary skill in the art that are relevant to the issues currently before me.  \n \nNow the disputed terms.  \n The first term is \u201cobeticholic acid Form 1 \u201d/ \u201cobeticholic acid \nis Form 1 \u201d in claims 1 -23 of the '673 Patent and claim 8 of the '117 \nPatent.  Plaintiff proposes the construction \u201c non-crystalline \nobeticholic acid. \u201d  The Apotex D efendants propose \u201c non-crystalline \nobeticholic acid made using a process in which crystalline \n \n1  There are no terms in dispute for RE  48,286, in another patent family. 6 obeticholic acid is produced as a synthetic intermediate in the \npenultim ate step of the synthesis.\u201d   And the other D efendants \nassert [ed] that no construction is  necessary but today at the hearing \nthey represented that if pressed to tell me what the meaning is they agreed with Apotex.  \n The crux of the dispute is whether to read the process aspects \nApotex advocates into the term.  And as to that issue, I agree with Plaintiffs that the answer should be no.  And I will adopt Plaintiffs \u2019 \nproposed construction and construe the term as \u201c non-crystalline \nobeticholic acid. \u201d \n I think that this construction is supported by Federal Circuit \ncase law.  In Phillips v. AWH Corp., t he Federal Circuit made clear \nthat when \u201c the specification [] reveal[s] a definition given to a claim \nterm .  . . the inventor \u2019s lexicography governs.\u201d\n[2]  Here, the \nspecification defines the term, stating: \u201c As used herein, the term \n\u201cobeticholic acid Form 1 \u201crefers to income obeticholic  acid. \u201d[3] \n \nDefendant Apotex argues that \u201c Intercept \u2019s alleged \ndescription of \u2018obeticholic acid form 1 \u2019 does not follow any \nstandardized format and thus \u2018 does not purport to be  \ndefinitional. \u2019\u201d[4]  I disagree.  The patentee \u2019s definitional syntax \nreferred to the term \u201c as used herein \u201d alongside the defined term.  The \nterm is in a section of the specification entitled \u201c Definitions. \u201d  In the \npatents, the phrase \u201c as used herein \u201d is put alongside a defined term \n15 time s. Moreover, the phrase \u201c as used herein \u201d has been recognized \nas definitional in a wide host of Federal Circuit and district court \ncases.[5] \n \n2  415 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2005). \n3  (\u2019673 Patent, 40:49\u201350; \u2019117 Patent, 41:6\u20137) .   \n4  (D.I. 115 at 17) . \n5  Apotex argues that, even if the Court were to find the phrase in question to be definitional, \nthe \u201cso -called \u2018express definition\u2019 cannot be read at the exclusion of the remainder of the \npatent and prosecution history.\u201d  (D.I. 115 at 28).  N one of the case law Apo tex cites , \nhowever, requires the Court to define the term differently.  In Chiesi , footnote 10 rejects \nthe notion that the phrase in question was explicitly defined, and therefore the lexicographer rule was not implicated in that case.  Chiesi USA Inc. v. MSN Pharms. Inc., No. CV 19- 18564, 2021 WL 4843806, at *8 n.10 (D.N.J. Oct. 18, 2021) .  Apotex\u2019s  other \ncase, Trading Techs., is not helpful because the \u201cexpress definition\u201d in that case included \nthe parenthetical \u201c(discussed in detail later),\u201d and the Fede ral Circuit affirmed the district \ncourt construing the definition in light of the referenced discussion.  Trading Techs. Int \u2019l, 7 Second, product claims are typically not limited by a method \nof manufacture, and process limitations will only be \u201c treated as part \nof a product claim if the patentee has made clear that the process \nsteps are an essential part of the claimed invention. \u201d[6]  And contrary \nto Apotex\u2019 s arguments, the patents here do not clearly treat the \nprocess as an essential part of th e claimed invention.  As I already \ndiscussed, the patentee defined the term in question and did not define it in terms of the process by which is it made.  And further, \nthe specification contains some discussion of the compound as a compound, and not the p roduct of a process, including a statement \nthat the \u201c present invention relates to a obeticholic acid, or a \npharmaceutically  acceptable salt, solvate or amino acid conjugate \nthereof, having a potency of greater than about 98%  . . . .\u201d\n[7]  That \nportion of the patent does not refer to Form 1, but at least one other portion does.  At column 31, line 49 of the \u2019 673 Patent, it says \u201c [t]he \npresent application provides compositions comprising obeticholic acid Form 1 and processes for the synthesis of highly pure acid Form 1 . . .\u201d  \n Additionally, the prosecution history shows  that although \nthe patentee originally included product and process claims, a restriction requirement was imposed because the Examiner regarded the product and the process as being distinct inventions .  And the \napplicants elected to proceed with the product claims, not the process claims.\n[8]  In light of all of this, I do not conclude that the \nprocess is \u201can essential part of the claimed invention. \u201d  And I will, \nas I have already said, construe obeticholic acid Form 1 and obeticholic acid is Form 1 as \u201c non-crystalline obeticholic acid. \u201d \n The second term is \u201c substantially pure solid form of \nobeticholic acid \u201d in claim 1 of the \u2019 117 Patent.  Plaintiffs propose \nthe construction \u201c obeticholic acid that has a potency of greater than \nabout 95%, taking into account impurities, including solvents and water. \u201d  The Apotex D efendants propose the construction \u201c non-\ncrystal line obeticholic acid made using a process in which \ncrystalline obeticholic acid is produced as a synthetic intermediate in the penultimate step of synthesis.\u201d   And the remaining D efendants \n \nInc. v. eSpeed, Inc. , 595 F.3d 1340, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2010) .  Unlike Trading Techs., the \ndefinition here is exclusive and conclus ive. \n6  Anderson Corp. v. Fiber Composites, LLC, 474 F.3d 1361, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2007). \n7  (\u2019673 Patent, 3:29\u201331) .  \n8  (D.I. 117, Exhibits F and E ). 8 again said no construction is necessary but today said that if pre ssed, \nthey agree with Apotex.  \n \nThe dispute for this term is essentially the same as just \ndiscussed for the first term.   So I will just go ahead and say that I \nfind that the specification \u2019s defining \u201c substantially pure obeticholic \nacid\u201d to be controlling for the reasons I stated in construing the \npreceding term.  The specification, at column 40, lines 40- 42, states: \n\u201cAs used herein, the term \u2018 substantially pure obeticholic acid\u2019  refers \nto obeticholic acid that has a potency of greater than about 95%.  \nThe potency of the obeticholic acid takes into account impurities including e.g., water, solvents, and other organic and inorganic impurities that are in a sample of obeticholic acid. \u201d  I think what I \nexpressed in my discussion of the previous term about lexicography and the process not being essential to the claimed invention is equally true here.  I understand that the term in the specification is \n\u201csubstantially pure obeticholic acid \u201d and not \u201c substantially pure \nsolid form of obeticholic acid,\u201d  but I agree with  Plaintiffs that the \nslight difference does not detract from the lexicography.  The \ndispute here is not about what solid means.  Both sides said that that \nterm is not disputed and I don't need to address it.  Instead, the \ndispute  \u2013 and what the parties are construing \u2013 is the part of the term \n\u201csubstantially pure obeticholic acid.\u201d   So I do think that \nlexicography applies and because of that and the additional reasons I stated for term 1, I will not import a process limitation into this claim.  And I will construe \u201c substantially pure solid form of \nobeticholic acid \u201d as \u201csolid form obetic holic acid that has a potency \nof greater than about 95%, taking into account impurities, including solvents and water. \u201d \n The third term is \u201c particles \u201d in claims 1 -8, 13 and 15 of the \n\u2019337 Patent, claims 1 and 19 of the \u2019 349 Patent , and claims 12 and \n23 of the \u2019549 Patent.  Plaintiffs say that no construction is necessary \nwhereas the Apotex D efendants propose the construction \n\u201cobeticholic acid that has been subjected to jet milling. \u201d  The \nremaining D efendants agreed today with Apotex.  \n As I \u2019ve already noted,  process limitations will only be \n\u201ctreated as part of a product claim if the patentee has made clear that \nthe process steps are an essential part of the claimed invention. \u201d\n[9]  \nAnd again, I do not think the necessary clarity exists here.  \n \n \n9  Anderson Corp. v. Fiber Composites, LLC , 474 F.3d 1361, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 9 First, the paten tee never referred to the jet -milling process as \nrequired.  The specification discusses jet -milling extensively, but \nnever as an essential process for the claimed product.   Instead, the \nspecification discusses jet -milling in the context of embodiments[10] \nand in discussing the importance of particle size.  With respect to \nparticle size and distribution, the specification is clear that \nmicronizing is what is important, and the patent states explicitly that \n\u201c[i]n one embodiment, the micronizing is carried out  using a jet -\nmill.\u201d  So I don \u2019t find anything in the specification saying jet -milling \nis required.[11] \n \nAs Defendants point out, in their remarks to the patent \nexaminer the applicants described jet -milling as \u201c a preferred process \nfor making the claimed product particles. \u201d[12]  In those remarks, the \napplicants disparaged three other processes, saying that \u201c the claimed \nproduct cannot be made by another process such as ball milling, high pressure homogenization, or a cryogenic spray process because these processes may not provide the desired product size and particle size distribution. \u201d\n[13]  Nothing in these statements that refer to a \npreferred process and say others may not work, however, indicate that jet- milling is required.  Moreover, read in context, the \napplicants were responding to the Examiner \u2019s suggestion that \u201c [i]n \nthe instant case the product can be made by another and materially [sic] process such as ball milling, high pressure homogenization or a cryogenic spray process.\u201d\n[14]  So, I don\u2019 t see that as a clear \nstatement that applicants were disparaging every other micronizing process.  They were, rather, responding to the Examiner \u2019s \nsuggestion that the three specific micronizing processes cited could create the claimed product.  \n Additionally , claim differentiation weighs against importing \nthis limitation.   The Federal Circuit counsels that \u201c claim \ndifferentiation takes on relevance in the context of a claim \n \n10  (See, e.g., \u2019337 Patent, 16:15\u201316, 26:16\u201317) .   \n11  The specification makes clear that micronizing is required, and that \u201c[i]n one embodiment, the micronizing is carried out using a jet -mill.\u201d  ( See, e.g., \u2019337 Patent, 26:4\u20135) .  \n12  (D.I. 118, Exhibit R  at Appx 1349) . \n13  (Id.) \n14  (Id., Exhibit Q  at Appx 1335) . 10 \nconstruction that would render additional, or different, language in \nanother independent claim superfluous.\u201d[15] \n Here, claim 14 of the \u2019 337 Patent which depends from claim \n11 explicitly refers to jet- milling but independent claim 11 of the \nsame patent does not.  In fact the only thing that claim 14 adds is \nthat the obeticholic acid is jet- milled.  Reading in a process \nlimitation to \u201c particles \u201d would render claim 14\u2019 s additional \nlanguage superfluous.  Of course, claim differentiation creates a \nrebuttable presumption, not a total obstacle, but for the reasons stated above, I do not think Defendant Apotex has overcome that presumption.  Therefore, I will construe \u201cparticles \u201d to have its plain \nmeaning, which is minute portions of matter.  \n Finally, the fourth term , which is three similar phrases: \n\u201cintra-granular portion comprising obeticholic acid\u201d  / \u201cintra-\ngranular portion comprises said obeticholic acid\u201d  / \u201cintra-granular \nportion comprises obeticholic acid\u201d  in claim 11 of the \u2019 337 Patent, \nclaim 4 of the \u2019 349 Patent, and claims 12 and 23 of the \u2019 549 Patent. \nPlaintiffs propose that no construction is necessary.  And the Apotex \nand other Defendants propose the construction \u201cintra-granular \nportion comprising obeticholic acid that has been subjected to jet -\nmilling. \u201d \n The parties \u2019 arguments for this term are nearly identical to \nthat of the last term.  Actually, it seems to me that there is less \nsupport for importing the jet -milling limitation here than the last \nterm.  So I will refrain from importing them and give the term its \nplain and ordinary meaning.  And in doing that I am understanding \nthat the parties agree what intra -granular means and is not in dispute. \nIndeed, the Apotex D efendants used that term in its construction and \nthe only issue they raised is whether the  obeticholic acid had to be \njet-milled.  \n \n \n              \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge  \n \n \n15  Curtiss- Wright Flow Control Corp. v.
