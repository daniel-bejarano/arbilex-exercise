Cinacalcet hydrochloride is used to treat secondary\nhyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia in patients with certain medical conditions. (D.I. 195\n1 64; D.I. 202 64) Amgen has marketed cinacalcet under the brand name \u201cSensipar\u201d since\n2004, (DI. 195 { 65; D.I. 202 \u00a7 65) Sensipar has earned Amgen sales of over $1 billion\n\nannually since 2015. (D.I. 195 4 85; D.I. 202 4 69)\n\n1 Unless otherwise specified, all citations to the docket index refer to C.A. No. 19-md-2895.\n\n2 The End Payor Plaintiffs are also referred to as the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs. They include:\nUFCW Local 1500 Welfare Fund, Teamsters Local 237 Welfare Fund, Teamsters Local 237\nRetirees\u2019 Benefit Fund, and Teamster Western Region & Local 177 Health Care Plan. (See DI.\n202 fq 19-21)\n\n3 The Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs include: C\u00e9sar Castillo, LLC and KPH Healthcare Services,\nInc., a.k.a. Kinney Drugs, Inc. (See D.I. 195 Ff 16, 17)\n\n4 Teva also joins both of Amgen\u2019s motions to dismiss. (See D.I. 216)\nAmgen held an exclusive license to now-expired U.S. Patent No. 6,011,068 (the \u201c\u00b0068\npatent\u201d), which was listed in the Orange Book? in connection with Sensipar and covered the\ncinacalcet drug substance. (D.L. 195 ff] 66-69; D.I. 202 ] 66, 67, 70) As early as March 2008,\ngeneric manufacturers began filing abbreviated new drug applications (\u201cANDAs\u201d) to market\ngeneric versions of Sensipar. (D.I. 195 \u00a7 84; D.I. 202 4 76) Several of these early ANDA filers\nreceived tentative approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) before the\nMarch 8, 2018 expiration date of the \u2019068 patent. (D.I. 195 \u00a7\u00a7 95-98; D.I. 202 \u00a7\u00a5 92-95)\nBecause these early filers\u2019 challenges to the \u2019068 patent were unsuccessful, they were prohibited\nfrom entering the generic cinacalcet market until after the expiration of that patent. (D.I. 195\n{ 73; D.I. 202 79)\n\nOn June 28, 2016, Amgen obtained U.S. Patent No. 9,375,405 (the \u201c\u2019405 patent\u201d), which\ncovers formulations of cinacalcet. (D.I. 195 74, 75; DI. 202 | 74) The \u00b0405 patent expires on\nSeptember 22, 2026. (D.I. 195 \u00a7 66; D.I. 202 70) Amgen added the \u2019405 patent to the Orange\nBook listing for Sensipar; almost as soon as it did, generic manufacturers began to challenge it.\nBy June 2017, more than 20 generic manufacturers had filed ANDAs containing paragraph IV\ncertifications, representing to the FDA that the \u2019405 patent was invalid, unenforceable, or would\nnot be infringed by their generic products. (D.I. 195 {{ 83, 86, 87; D.I. 202 {{ 76, 77) Under the\n\ncircumstances, none of the ANDA filers would have been entitled to 180-day first-filer\n\n5 A drug manufacturer holding an approved new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) is required to notify\nthe FDA of certain categories of drug-related patents \u201cfor which a claim of patent infringement\ncould reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the\nmanufacture, use, or sale of the drug.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(b)(1)(A)(viii) and (c)(2). The FDA\nlists such patents in the \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d\nalso known as the \u201cOrange Book.\u201d See Andrx Pharms., Inc. v. Biovail Corp., 276 F.3d 1368,\n1371 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\nexclusivity. (D.L. 195 9 132; DI. 202 \u00a2 122) Between September 2016 and June 2017, Amgen\nbrought a series of lawsuits in this Court against these ANDA filers, alleging that the proposed\ngeneric products would infringe the 405 patent. (D.I. 195 J 89, 93; D.I. 202 {J 86, 90)\n\nBeginning in September 2017, Amgen settled most of these suits asserting the \u00b0405\npatent, starting with the ANDA filers who had the weakest cases (i.e., those filers who were least\nlikely to prove non-infringement, invalidity, or unenforceability of the 405 patent). (D.I. 195\n44 100, 109-16; D.I. 202 ff 97, 104-11) The agreements pursuant to which these cases were\nsettled required that the settling defendants (1) admit to infringement of the \u2019405 patent and\n(2) promise not to launch their generic versions of Sensipar before a specified and agreed entry\ndate (which was a date prior to the expiration of the 405 patent). (D.I. 195 { 101; D.I. 202 { 98)\nThe agreed entry dates varied among the settling defendants. (See, e.g., D.I. 195 {J 109, 113,\n135; D.L. 202 \u00a7f 107, 109, 131)\n\nEach of the settlement agreements also included an \u201cacceleration\u201d clause that would\nallow the settling defendants to enter the cinacalcet market before their agreed entry dates if\nanother generic manufacturer entered the cinacalcet market without authorization from Amgen;\nthat is, if another generic manufacturer launched its generic version of Sensipar \u201cat risk\u201d of being\nliable for patent infringement. (D.1. 195 4 101-03; D.I. 202 ff 98-100) Each of the acceleration\nprovisions also included a 10-day \u201cgrace\u201d period, during which Amgen could avoid triggering\nthe acceleration clauses \u2014 in other words, Amgen could prevent the settling generic\n\nmanufacturers from having their agreed entry dates accelerated \u2014 by either seeking a preliminary\n\n6 As an incentive for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge the Orange Book-listed\npatents, the first company to submit an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification may be granted\na 180-day period of generic marketing exclusivity, during which time the FDA will not approve\na later-filed ANDA based on the same NDA. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355()(5)(B)(iv); see also Janssen\nPharm., N.V. v. Apotex, Inc., 540 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2008).\ninjunction against the at-risk launcher or by reaching an agreement with the at-risk launcher to\ntake its generic cinacalcet product off the market. (D.I. 195 \u00a7 103; D.I. 202 { 100)\n\nIn March 2018, as the \u2019068 patent expired, and the FDA granted final approval to several\nANDAs ~ but none of the generic manufacturers holding an approved ANDA launched its\ncinacalcet product at that time. (D.I. 195 {J 178-82; D.L. 202 ff 134, 135, 163) Meanwhile, also\nin March 2018, the non-settled lawsuits asserting the \u2019405 patent went to trial before the\nHonorable Mitchell S. Goldberg, sitting by designation here in the District of Delaware.\nSpecifically, Amgen\u2019s cases were tried against four ANDA filers: Watson Laboratories, Inc.\n(\u201cWatson\u201d), Piramal Healthcare UK Ltd. (\u201cPiramal\u201d), Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC\n(\u201cAmneal\u201d), and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. (\u201cZydus\u201d). (D.1. 195 171; D.I. 202 158)\nFollowing a four-day bench trial, Judge Goldberg issued an opinion on July 27, 2018, finding\nthat the ANDAs of Watson, Piramal, and Amneal did not infringe any of the asserted claims of\nthe \u00b0405 patent while Zydus\u2019 ANDA did infringe some of the asserted claims. (D.I. 195 4\" 172,\n173; D.I. 202 ff] 161, 162; see also Amgen Inc. v. Amneal Pharms. LLC, 328 F. Supp. 3d 373 (D.\nDel. 2018)) The Court entered final judgment on August 24, 2018. (D.I. 195 174; D.L 202\n4] 164) Amgen and Zydus appealed the judgments to the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit. (D.I. 195 \u00a7 177; D.L. 202 { 166)\n\nOn December 27, 2018, while these appeals were pending, the FDA approved Watson\u2019s\nANDA. (D.L. 195 4 183; D.I. 202 | 170) The next day, Teva \u2014 which owns Watson\u2019s ANDA\u2019 \u2014\nlaunched Watson\u2019s approved generic cinacalcet product at risk. (D.I. 195 184; D.I. 202 { 170)\n\nOver the next several days, Teva sold and shipped more than 409,000 bottles of the product to\n\n7 Hence, any reference in this Opinion to \u201cTeva\u2019s\u201d product is a reference to Watson\u2019s product as\napproved by the FDA.\nwholesalers, which was sufficient supply to satisfy 1.6 to 3.6 months of the entire U.S. market\ndemand. These several days of sales generated revenues of approximately $393 million, netting\napproximately $213 million in profits. (D.L. 195 \u00a7\u00a5 184, 187; D.I. 202 fj 170, 171)\n\nWithin less than a week, on January 2, 2019, Amgen and Teva reached a settlement (the\n\u201cAmgen-Teva Agreement\u201d). (D.I. 195 J 189; D.I. 202 ] 180) Pursuant to the Amgen-Teva\nAgreement, Teva agreed to immediately cease sales of its generic cinacalcet product and not to\nresume sales until June 30, 2021 (five years before the *405 patent was set to expire) \u2014 all subject\nto the operation of an acceleration clause that would permit Teva to reenter the market sooner\nthan the agreed-upon date if another generic manufacturer launched at risk. (D.I. 195 { 190; D.I.\n202 \u00a7 193)\n\nUnder the Amgen-Teva Agreement, Teva was not required to remove from the market\nany of the product it had distributed during the at-risk launch. It was, however, required to pay\nAmgen an initial payment of $10 million followed by additional payments that might bring the\ntotal amount paid by Teva to Amgen to as much as $40 million. Teva\u2019s additional payments\nwould not be required if another generic cinacalcet product entered the market. (D.I. 195 { 190,\nD.L. 202 ff 180-82, 193)\n\nAmgen and Teva also agreed to jointly request that Judge Goldberg issue an indicative\nruling vacating the non-infringement finding with respect to the Watson generic cinacalcet\nproduct and enter the parties\u2019 proposed consent judgment \u2014 including Teva\u2019s admission of\ninfringement \u2014 if the Federal Circuit, upon the parties\u2019 notification that Judge Goldberg would\ngrant their request for an indicative ruling, would remand the case for that purpose. (D.I. 195 {ff\n192, 193; D.I. 202 f 194, 195) Judge Goldberg later denied Amgen and Teva\u2019s request. (DI.\n\n195 4 196; D.1. 202 4216)\nOn January 4, 2019, two days after execution of the Amgen-Teva Agreement, counsel for\nAmgen wrote a letter to counsel for Cipla Ltd. (\u201cCipla\u201d) \u2014 another ANDA filer secking approval\nto market a generic cinacalcet product \u2014 asking Cipla to confirm that it would not engage in an\nat-risk launch based on Teva\u2019s launch. (D.I. 195 \u00a7 207; D.1. 202 | 204) Amgen also notified\nCipla that, if Cipla launched its product at risk, Amgen would exercise its rights and pursue the\nremedies available to it under their settlement agreement (the \u201cAmgen-Cipla Agreement\u201d). (D.I.\n195 J 207; D.L. 202 | 204)\n\nOn January 8, 2019, Cipla filed a lawsuit against Amgen (the \u201cCipla action,\u201d C.A. No.\n19-44-LPS) in this Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to launch its generic\ncinacalcet product under the terms the \u201cAmgen-Cipla Agreement.\u201d (D.I. 195 { 210; D.I. 202\n4211) The Cipla action also alleged antitrust violations and patent misuse. (D.I. 195 ff 210-1 1;\nD.1. 202 49 211-12) After Cipla obtained a copy of the Amgen-Teva Agreement through\nexpedited discovery, Cipla amended its complaint to add Teva as a co-defendant. (D.I. 195\n\u00a7 213; D.L. 202 4 214)\n\nOn March 6, 2019, while the Cip/a action was pending, Cipla launched at risk, although\n\u201cnot selling in anything like the volume it would sell if it did not have this threat [from the\nlawsuit by Amgen] hanging over it.\u201d (D.I. 195 9] 214, 220; D.I. 202 ff] 215, 221) On March 11,\n2019, Amgen moved in the Cipla action for a preliminary injunction, seeking to restrain Cipla\u2019s\nsales of its generic cinacalcet product. (DI. 195 | 216; D.I. 202 4217) On May 2, 2019, the\nCourt denied Amgen\u2019s motion, finding Amgen was not likely to succeed on the merits of its\nbreach of contract claim because the Amgen-Cipla Agreement did not entitle Amgen to any\nrelief against Cipla\u2019s launch of generic cinacalcet. See Cipla Ltd. v. Amgen Inc. , 386 F. Supp. 3d\n\n386, 400 (D. Del. 2019). On appeal the Third Circuit affirmed. See Cipla Ltd. v. Amgen Inc.,\n778 F. App\u2019x 135 (d Cir. 2019). Following the Court\u2019s denial of Amgen\u2019s motion for a\npreliminary injunction in the Cipla action, several other manufacturers launched their generic\ncinacalcet products. (D.I. 195 ff] 227-30, 232; D.I. 202 {J 226-29, 231)\n\nIn the meantime, between February 2019 and April 2019, the DPPs and the EPPs\n(collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed four class action antitrust lawsuits against Amgen and Teva\n(collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the District of New Jersey,\nand the District of Delaware.\u2019 On July 31, 2019, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\n(\u201cJPML\u201d) centralized the Cipla action and the four class actions for coordinated pretrial\nproceedings in this Court. (See D.I. 1; see also In re Sensipar (Cinacalcet Hydrochloride\nTablets) Antitrust Litig., 412 F. Supp. 3d 1344 (J.P.M.L. 2019))\n\nOn September 13, 2019, the DPPs and the EPPs filed consolidated class action\ncomplaints on behalf of direct purchasers and indirect purchasers, respectively. (See generally\nDI. 12, 13) On October 15, 2019, Amgen and Teva moved to dismiss both complaints. (See\nD.I. 27, 30, 31) On July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Hall issued a Report and Recommendation,\nin which she recommended that the Court dismiss all of Plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state law claims\nwithout prejudice and with leave to amend. (See D.I. 157 at 25) On November 30, 2020, the\nundersigned Judge adopted in part Judge Hall\u2019s Report and Recommendation, finding that\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims based on the theory of an unlawful reverse payment from Amgen to Teva did\n\n8 On February 21, 2019, UFCW Local 1500 Welfare Fund filed a class action antitrust complaint\nin this District on behalf of entities that indirectly purchased or provided reimbursement for the\npurchase of cinacalcet. (See C.A. No. 19-369 D.I. 1) On February 26, 2019, C\u00e9sar Castillo, Inc.\nfiled a class action antitrust complaint in this District on behalf of direct purchasers of cinacalcet.\n(See C.A. No. 19-396 D.I. 1) On March 14, 2019, Teamsters Local 237 Welfare Fund and\nTeamsters Local 237 Retirees\u2019 Benefit Fund filed an indirect-purchaser class action in the\nDistrict of New Jersey. (See C.A. No. 19-1461 D.I. 1) On April 9, 2019, KPH Healthcare\nServices, Inc. filed a direct-purchaser class action complaint in the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania. (See C.A. No. 19-1460 D.L. 1)\nnot warrant dismissal. (D.I. 177 at 9-12) The Court agreed with Judge Hall that Plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims based on two other theories did not survive the motions to dismiss: (1) that the Amgen-\nTeva Agreement delayed the entry of generic manufacturers other than Teva (see id. at 6); and\n(2) that the use of acceleration clauses deterred generic manufacturers from marketing generic\ncinacalcet (see id. at 7). The Court granted Plaintiffs leave to amend the consolidated class\naction complaints to include \u201conly those claims and theories that remain[ed] in the case.\u201d (Id. at\n17; see also id. at 3 (\u201cPlaintiffs are granted leave to file amended complaints, consistent with the\nReport and this Order, provided that any such amended complaint must be filed no later than\nDecember 30, 2020... .\u201d) (internal emphasis omitted)) The Court also denied Amgen\u2019s motion\ndirected solely to the EPPs\u2019 state law claims, without prejudice to renew after the filing of any\namended complaint. (Jd. at 3)\n\nOn February 16, 2021 and March 5, 2021, the DPPs and the EPPs filed their respective\namended consolidated class action complaints.\u201d (See generally D.I. 195, 202) The DPPs\u2019\namended consolidated class action complaint includes four counts under Sections 1 and 2 of the\nSherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. (See D.I. 195 {J 281-319) The EPPs\u2019 amended\nconsolidated class action complaint includes three claims for injunctive and other equitable relief\nunder Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, as well as a series of state law\nantitrust, unfair trade, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment claims. (See D.I. 202 {J 276-\n\n427)\n\n\u00b0 The EPPs filed their amended consolidated class action complaints on February 16, 2021. (D.I.\n196) The parties then stipulated to allow the EPPs to file the second amended consolidated class\naction complaint to include another end-payor plaintiff, Teamsters Western Region & Local 177\nHealth Care Fund (\u201cTWR\u201d). (See D.I. 199) To avoid confusion, the Court will refer to the\nPlaintiffs\u2019 second amended consolidated class action complaints (D.I. 195, 202) as their\n\u201camended consolidated class action complaints.\u201d\nOn March 30, 2021, Amgen and Teva filed the pending motions to dismiss. (See D.I.\n209, 211, 213) The motions are fully and extensively briefed. (See, e.g., D.I. 210, 212, 214,\n215, 222-24, 228, 232, 233, 243, 245, 246) The Court heard oral argument on the motions, using\nvideoconference technology, on July 13, 2021.

Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) permits the dismissal of an action for \u201clack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\u201d A Rule 12(b)(1) motion may present either a facial or factual\nchallenge to the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. See Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 346\n(3d Cir. 2016). A facial attack contests the sufficiency of the pleadings, whereas a factual attack\ncontests the sufficiency of jurisdictional facts. See Lincoln Ben. Life Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, 800\nF.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir. 2015). When considering a facial attack, the Court accepts the plaintiff's\nwell-pleaded factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences from those\nallegations in the plaintiffs favor. See In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data Breach Litig.,\n846 F.3d 625, 633 (3d Cir. 2017). When reviewing a factual attack, the Court may weigh and\nconsider evidence outside the pleadings. See Gould Elecs. Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d 169,\n176 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nB. Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n\nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires\nthe Court to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint.

Plaintiffs\u2019 Federal Antitrust Claims\n\n1 Reverse Payment Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act\n(DPPs\u2019 Count IV and EPPs\u2019 Second Claim for Relief)\n\nIn the amended complaints, Plaintiffs allege that, under the Amgen-Teva Agreement,\nAmgen provided a \u201clarge and unjustified payment\u201d to Teva in exchange for delay of generic\nentry into the cinacalcet market. (D.I. 195 4 312; D.I. 202 4 285) According to Plaintiffs, the\n\u201clarge and unjustified\u201d reverse payment included:\n\n(1) Teva\u2019s retained revenue from its generic product launch,\n\n(2) an agreed entry date that provides Teva with exclusive market\nentry before other generic entrants, and\n\n(3) an acceleration provision, assuring Teva an ability to resume\n\nsales of its generic product if another generic launched before\n\nTeva\u2019s entry date.\n(D.1. 195 4 312; D.L. 202 \u00a7 285) Plaintiffs allege that the reverse payment scheme under the\nAmgen-Teva Agreement \u201csubstantially, unreasonably, and unduly restrained trade in the\n[cinacalcet] market.\u201d (D.I. 195 7 313; D.I. 202 [ 286) Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the\nAmgen-Teva Agreement had the \u201cpurpose and effect\u201d to:\n\na. eliminate existing competition between Amgen and Teva\n\nand to prevent Teva from competing with Amgen by selling its\n\ngeneric version of Sensipar until mid-2021;\n\nb. delay entry of generic versions of Sensipar by companies\n\nother than Teva in order to maintain the period in which Amgen\n\nbrand Sensipar monopolizes the relevant market; and\n\nc. raise and maintain the prices that Plaintiffs and the class\n\nwould pay for Sensipar and Teva\u2019s generic Sensipar to and at\n\nsupra-competitive levels.\n\n(D.L. 195 ] 313; D.L. 202 \u00a7 286)\n\n11\nThe Court already considered the plausibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 reverse payment claim in\nconnection with Defendants\u2019 motions (D.I. 27, 31) to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 original complaints (D.I.\n12, 13). The Court concluded then that \u201ca portion of Plaintiff's Section 1 claims survive the\nmotions to dismiss, specifically the theories embodied in statements a and c above (but not b).\u201d\n(D.I. 177 at 6) In the amended complaints, Plaintiffs have re-pled all the key facts supporting the\nreverse payment claim. (See, e.g., D.I. 222 at 32-33) The Court finds no persuasive reason to\ndepart from its previous conclusion.!\u00b0\n\nIn support of their motions now directed at the amended complaints, and notwithstanding\nthe Court\u2019s earlier analysis, Defendants contend that the payments Teva received from Amgen\ndo not qualify as \u201clarge and unjustified,\u201d as required to state a reverse payments claim under\nFed. Trade Comm\u2019n v. Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. 136 (2013). (See D.I. 212 at 8) Defendants first\nargue that the Amgen-Teva Agreement \u201cfunction[ed] like the early entry compromise explicitly\nblessed by Actavis\u201d because it allowed Teva to sell its generic drug product prior to the\nexpiration of the \u2019405 patent. (See id. at 9) However, as the Court has explained:\n\n[While one might view as pro-competitive Amgen\u2019s agreement\nthat Teva could enter the market five years before Amgen\u2019s patent\nwould otherwise exclude Teva, one might alternatively view\nAmgen\u2019s inducement of Teva to leave the market after just a week\n\nof sales .. . approximately 2 % years before the agreed-upon re-\nentry date (June 2021), as anti-competitive.\n\n10 Also consistent with its previous decision, the Court finds that the reverse payment included\n(1) the release of Amgen\u2019s infringement claim for damages against Teva, thus allowing Teva to\nretain most of the revenues from its at-risk sales, and (2) the acceleration clause provided to Teva\nin the Amgen-Teva Agreement. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the payment included \u201can agreed entry\ndate that provides Teva with exclusive market entry before other generic entrants\u201d is implausible,\nas the operative complaints allege that at least seven other generic manufacturers obtained the\nsame entry date as Teva, leaving Teva with no \u201cexclusive market entry.\u201d (See D.I. 195 ff 139-\n46; DL. 202 {ff 135-42)\n\n12\n(D.I. 177 at 13-14) Determining which of these competing inferences is correct (and supported\nby a preponderance of the evidence) is not possible at this stage of the case. Accordingly, the\nCourt cannot conclude at this stage that the Amgen-Teva Agreement is consistent with those\nagreements \u201cblessed by Actavis.\u201d\n\nDefendants also take issue with Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the weakness of\nAmgen\u2019s patent infringement claims, contending that these allegations \u201cflatly contradict any\ntheory that Amgen\u2019s release was disproportionately valuable compared to the up-to-$40 million\nthat Teva agreed to pay for it.\u201d (D.I. 212 at 9-10) Defendants specifically point to the allegation\nthat Amgen had no \u201creasonable expectation of prevailing on its patent merits\u201d (D.I. 195 201;\nDI. 202 | 186; see also D.L. 212 at 9-10; Tr. at 10-11), arguing that Plaintiffs effectively\n\u201cabandoned\u201d the reverse payment theory, as \u201c[u]nder the facts pled, Amgen\u2019s release was\nworthless, and no meaningful consideration flowed from Amgen to Teva from the granting of\nthat release.\u201d (D.I. 232 at 9n.11) Defendants\u2019 argument is based on the common-sense notion\nthat if Plaintiffs are correct that Amgen\u2019s patent claims were weak, then when Amgen released\nTeva from liability on those patent claims, Amgen was giving close to nothing of value to Teva.\nThe Court, however, is not persuaded that Plaintiffs have effectively pled themselves out of a\nreverse payments claim.\n\nAs an initial matter, Amgen\u2019s purported assessment of the merits of its patent\ninfringement claims is not necessarily indicative of the value of its release as perceived by Teva.\nAt this early stage, in connection with a motion to dismiss and without any evidence, it would be\nimproper to infer from the allegation that Amgen had no \u201creasonable expectation of prevailing\n\non its patent merits\u201d that Teva also believed Amgen had no real case against Teva. It would be\n\n13\nimproper, then, to draw the inference \u2014 against Plaintiffs \u2014 that \u201cAmgen\u2019s release was\nworthless.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a motion to dismiss in an antitrust case does not present an opportunity for the\nCourt to accurately assess the strength of a party\u2019s patent claims. Without evidence in the\nrecord, the Court is not in a position to determine the value of Amgen\u2019s patent infringement\nclaims relative to, among other things, (i) the value of Teva\u2019s retained revenue, (ii) the value of\nthe payment made by Teva to Amgen, or (iii) the litigation costs each party saved by settling.\nThus, the impact of the purported weakness of Amgen\u2019s infringement claims against Teva on\nAmgen\u2019s release of those claims is not a question the Court is in a position to resolve at this\npoint,!!\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the Third Circuit\u2019s guidance that a plaintiff can satisfy\nthe pleading standard for a reverse payments claim \u201cwithout describing in perfect detail the\nworld without the reverse payment, calculating reliably the payment\u2019s exact size, or preempting\nevery possible explanation for it.\u201d Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n v. AbbVie Inc., 976 F.3d 327, 356 (3d\nCir, 2020). Even assuming Defendants are correct that the value of Amgen\u2019s release depends, to\nsome extent, on the strength of Amgen\u2019s infringement claims (see D.L. 212 at 9), Plaintiffs are\nnot required, at the pleading stage, to account for the precise impact of the weakness of Amgen\u2019s\ninfringement claims on the value of the release. In addition, \u201ceven if there is an explanation for a\n\nreverse payment, that possibility [does] not justify dismissing the antitrust plaintiff's\n\n1 Defendants\u2019 reliance on Jn re Lipitor Antitrust Litig. , 868 F.3d 231 (3d Cir. 2017), is\nmisplaced. (See D.I. 212 at 9) In Lipitor, the release of an infringement claim that had a \u201chigh\nlikelihood of success\u201d was found to support the allegation of a reverse payment. See 868 F.3d at\n253. Lipitor did not, however, hold that the release of an infringement claim that was\npurportedly \u201cweak\u201d could not also constitute a reverse payment (particularly in combination with\nother value given from the patentee to the alleged infringer).\n\n14\ncomplaint.\u201d In re Lipitor Antitrust Litig., 868 F.3d 231, 257 Gd Cir. 2017) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Instead, Defendants will have an opportunity, as this case proceeds, to attempt\nto show that \u201clegitimate justifications are present, thereby explaining the presence of the\nchallenged term and showing the lawfulness of that term under the rule of reason.\u201d Actavis, 570\nUSS. at 156.\n\nPlaintiffs have plausibly stated a Section 1 claim under the reverse payment theory. Teva\ngenerated revenues of $393 million and made over $200 million in profits from its at-risk sales.\n(See D.I. 195 4\u00a7 184, 187; D.I. 202 4] 170, 171) The Amgen-Teva Agreement only required that\nTeva pay Amgen no more than $40 million in damages, thus allowing Teva to retain nearly 90%\nof its revenues and nearly 80% of its profits. (See D.I. 195 190; D.L. 202 \u00a7\u00a5 180-82, 193)\nTeva\u2019s retention of revenue (notwithstanding Amgen\u2019s allegations of patent infringement), in an\namount of no less than $353 million, in combination with an acceleration clause (allowing Teva\nto immediately re-enter the cinacalcet market should other generic manufacturers launch their\ncinacalcet products), plausibly amounted to a \u201clarge and unjustified\u201d transfer of value from\nAmgen to Teva, as alleged by Plaintiffs. (See, e.g., D.I. 195 4 312; D.I. 202 \u00a2 285)\n\nAs the Court previously explained, and continues to hold:\n\n[T]he Amgen-Teva revenue retention provisions were, in fact, a\nbrand providing a generic with a share of monopoly profits the\n\nbrand would otherwise have earned over the few days of seeming\ncompetition, before the brand induced the generic to exit the\n\n2 The value to Teva of the acceleration clause in the Amgen-Teva Agreement is that it allows\nTeva to re-enter the generic cinacalcet market ahead of their agreed-upon entry date, if another\ngeneric launches. Combined with the revenues and profits Teva was permitted to retain, the\nCourt concludes \u2014 under the required \u201cholistic analysis\u201d (D.I. 177 at 11) \u2014 that Plaintiffs have\nsufficiently alleged a plausible \u201clarge and unjustified\u201d payment from Amgen to Teva. The Court\nneed not decide whether the acceleration clause on its own would satisfy the pleading standard.\n(See D.I. 212 at 11 n.7) Further, as the Court has previously concluded (and now adheres to),\nPlaintiffs\u2019 theory that the acceleration clause deterred other generics is not plausible. (See D.I.\n177 at 15-16)\n\n15\n\nmarket in exchange for (among other things) keeping most of the\nprofits the generic earned over those few days.\n\n(D.I. 177 at 10) In other words, the consideration that allegedly flowed from Amgen to Teva\npursuant to the Amgen-Teva Agreement \u2014 which, for purposes of illustration, the Court will refer\nto collectively as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 consisted primarily of the $393 million of revenues Amgen permitted\nTeva to earn through its at-risk launch, the release of Amgen\u2019s patent infringement claims\nagainst Teva (which protected Teva\u2019s retention of revenue), and the acceleration clause. In turn,\nthe consideration that allegedly flowed from Teva to Amgen pursuant to their agreement \u2014\nwhich, for purposes of illustration, the Court will refer to collectively as \u201cB\u201d \u2014 consisted\nprimarily of Teva paying Amgen up to $40 million.\u201d The issues as this case proceeds will\ninclude: (1) is the value of A greater than the value of B, such that net value flowed from\nAmgen, the patentee, to Teva, the alleged infringer (i.e., a reverse payment); and (2) if so, is the\nnet value (i.e., A minus B) large and unjustified? These are, as the Court has explained, simply\nnot questions that can be decided (at least in this case) on the pleadings.\n\nDefendants next contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 reverse payment, or pay-for-delay, theory fails\n\u201cnot only for lack of an unjustified payment, but also due to lack of any \u2018delay.\u2019\u201d\u201d (D.L 212 at\n11) According to Defendants, because the amended complaints allege that Teva sold \u201cits entire\ninventory\u201d before execution of the Amgen-Teva Agreement (see D.I. 195 { 184; D.I. 202 { 170),\n\nand include \u201cno fact indicating Teva would or could have continued selling at risk,\u201d there is no\n\n13 Of course, Teva\u2019s cessation of sales of its generic cinacalcet product (i.e., exiting the market)\nalso had significant value to Amgen. In evaluating the consideration flowing to Amgen,\nhowever, this value is not included in \u201cB\u201d because it is (allegedly, and plausibly so) the\nprohibited \u201cdelay\u201d in Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201creverse payment for delay\u201d claim. That is, in assessing whether\nthe amounts Amgen paid to Teva to \u201cdelay\u201d Teva\u2019s entry (or delay Teva\u2019s \u201cpermanent entry\u201d or\n\u201cre-entry\u201d) into the market are \u201clarge and unjustified,\u201d it does not matter what that delay was\n\nworth to Amgen.\n\n16\nallegation that could plausibly support the theory that the Amgen-Teva Agreement caused any\ndelay in Teva\u2019s sales. (See D.I. 212 at 11-12) This argument is unpersuasive. Instead, the Court\nagrees with Plaintiffs it is plausible that \u201cabsent the [Amgen-Teva A]greement, Teva would have\nobtained and produced more cinacalcet, as any rational economic actor would have done.\u201d (D.L.\n222 at 37) While it is also plausible that \u201cTeva took a unilateral risk and timed its launch (and\nvoluntary exit)\u201d and was never, under any circumstances, going to market any more of its\ngeneric product (at least not at-risk) (see D.I. 212 at 12), the Court must draw all reasonable\ninferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor on a motion to dismiss. It is reasonable to infer \u2014 from, at\nminimum, Teva\u2019s large and quick sales as well its negotiation of an acceleration provision that\ncould permit it to reenter the market quickly \u2014 that Teva had both the capacity and willingness to\nremain on the generic cinacalcet market, had it not been for the Amgen-Teva Agreement.\nDefendants advocate for a general principle that \u201csettling damages from at-risk sales of\nthe same drug as the disputed patent is not an antitrust violation under Actavis.\u201d (Jd.)\nDefendants contend that \u201creleasing a claim for at-risk damages \u2014 if it relates to the same patent\nbeing litigated \u2014 provides the generic with nothing more than a compromise of the enforcement\nof claims tied to the disputed patent.\u201d (/d.) In these circumstances, according to Defendants,\n\u201cthere is no reason to believe the generic agreed to an entry date not driven by the strength of the\npatent case.\u201d (Id.) The Court declines to adopt this approach, for which Defendants have not\ncited persuasive authority.'4 Even when a claim for at-risk damages relates to the same patent\n\nbeing litigated, it is possible the patentee may offer to accept an unreasonably low damages\n\n14 While Defendants are correct (see, e.g., D.I. 212 at 13) that Lipitor, 868 F.3d at 253, involved\na brand company delaying the generic entry of one drug by releasing infringement claims\ncovering a different drug, there is no suggestion in Lipitor that settling patent infringement\nclaims for the same drug would be immune from antitrust scrutiny.\n\n17\npayment in exchange for the generic manufacturer\u2019s agreement to a later re-entry date. This is\nnot necessarily a \u201ctraditional\u201d settlement, in which \u201ca party with a claim (or counterclaim) for\ndamages receives a sum equal to or less than the value of its claim,\u201d to account for \u201cavoided\nlitigation costs or fair value for [the generic\u2019s] services.\u201d Actavis, 570 U.S. at 152, 156. Instead,\nit may be a settlement in which the generic \u201cpays\u201d the branded company far less than the value\nthe generic earned and, thus, retains great value from its at-risk launch, thereby effectively\nreceiving large payments from the branded company, all in exchange for removing its product;\nthat is, \u201cwalk[ing] away with money simply so it will stay away from the patentee\u2019s market.\u201d Id.\nat 152. As the Supreme Court instructed, \u201csettlements taking this form tend to have significant\nadverse effects on competition.\u201d Jd. at 148.\n\nFinally, Defendants insist that permitting Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims to proceed will have\na chilling effect on generic competition because any generic settling patent litigation after an at-\ntisk launch would have to choose between \u201ceither repay[ing] the entire value of the at-risk\ninfringement claim or settl[ing] on reasonable terms but fac[ing] the near-certain prospect of\nexpensive class action antitrust litigation.\u201d (D.I. 212 at 14; see also D.I. 214 at 19-20) The\nCourt cannot, however, ground its conclusion in Defendants\u2019 policy argument, no matter how\npersuasive. The Court\u2019s understanding of the law leads it to conclude, instead, that damages\nsettlements arising from at-risk sales of the same drug as the disputed patent are not exempt from\nantitrust liability. )\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Court continues to conclude that Plaintiffs have\n\nplausibly stated a Section 1 claim under the reverse payment theory.\n\n15 Defendants\u2019 references to a California statute and an FTC decision (see D.I. 212 at 14), while\nhelpful to the Court\u2019s analysis, are not dispositive here, for reasons including that they are not\nbinding authority.\n\n18\n2. Market Allocation Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act\n(DPPs\u2019 Count III and EPPs\u2019 First Claim for Relief)\n\nIn the amended complaints, Plaintiffs also allege that the Amgen-Teva Agreement\nviolated Section 1 of the Sherman Act under a market allocation theory. Specifically, Plaintiffs\nallege that the Amgen-Teva Agreement was \u201cpreceded by, and built upon, Amgen\u2019s numerous\npatent infringement settlements with other generic Sensipar manufacturers.\u201d (D.I. 195 { 303;\nD.1. 202 | 278) The settlement agreements at issue included \u201cacceleration\u201d clauses \u2014 which\nallowed the settling generics to immediately enter the generic cinacalcet market after a third-\nparty at-risk launch \u2014 and \u201cgrace\u201d periods within which Amgen could act to avoid triggering\nthese \u201cacceleration\u201d clauses, either by seeking a preliminary injunction or reaching an agreement\nwith the at-risk launcher. (See, e.g., D.I. 195 FJ 101-03, 303, 308; D.I. 202 4] 98-100, 278, 279)\nPlaintiffs further allege:\n\nWhen Teva launched its generic Sensipar at-risk, Teva and Amgen\n\nbecame horizontal market competitors. By then entering the\n\nAmgen-Teva Agreement on January 2, 2020, Amgen and Teva\n\nutilized the \u201cgrace\u201d period that Amgen had also inserted into each\n\nof its prior settlement agreements with generic Sensipar ANDA\n\nholders, thwarting market entry by those other generics. Amgen\n\nand Teva agreed to divide up the market for Sensipar and its\n\ngeneric equivalent, sharing hundreds of millions in profits from\n\nsales at supra-competitive prices.\n(D.I. 195 { 304; D.I. 202 \u00a7 279) By this theory, Plaintiffs allege that the Amgen-Teva\nAgreement caused the same antitrust effects as those resulting from their reverse payment theory,\nincluding both \u201celiminat[ing] existing competition between Amgen and Teva\u201d and \u201cdelay[ing]\n\nentry of generic versions of Sensipar by companies other than Teva.\u201d (D.I. 195 { 313; D.I. 202\n\n277)\n\n19\nTo the extent Plaintiffs are alleging that the Amgen-Teva Agreement reduced\ncompetition by removing Teva from the cinacalcet market, the Court agrees with Defendants that\nPlaintiffs\u2019 market allocation theory is effectively a pay-for-delay theory and, hence, \u201cdepends\nupon an allegation of an unlawful \u2018reverse payment\u201d governed by the rule of reason test under\nActavis. (See D.I. 212 at 15.10) The Court sees no good reason to treat this part of Plaintiffs\u2019\nmarket allocation theory as a standalone claim; all of the allegations (and, eventually, evidence)\nsupporting this theory can be included as part of the reverse payment theory the Court has\nalready held will proceed.\n\nWith respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 market allocation theory alleging that the Amgen-Teva\nAgreement delayed the entry of generic cinacalcet manufacturers other than Teva, the Court\nconcludes that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. The Court previously held that the market\nallocation theory alleged in the original complaints was deficient because Plaintiffs had failed to\nplead facts as to whether \u201cTeva had any involvement in Amgen\u2019s settlements with the other\ngeneric manufacturers or that Teva\u2019s decision to launch at risk was made with Amgen\u2019s\nknowledge, authorization, or agreement.\u201d (D.I. 177 at 7) Nor had Plaintiffs alleged that\n\u201cDefendants agreed prior to Teva\u2019s launch that Teva could enter the market and they would\nshare monopoly profits.\u201d (/d.) In the amended complaints, Plaintiffs have still failed to plead\nthese such facts that might support a plausible theory of a conspiracy between Amgen and Teva\nto exclude other generic cinacalcet manufacturers from the market.\n\nAt points it appears that Plaintiffs now contend that since Amgen and Teva entered into\nan \u201cactual agreement\u201d purportedly restricting market competition, no allegation of any prior\ncollusion to allocate the market is required. (See D.J. 222 at 25-26) Such a contention, however,\n\nis contradicted by Plaintiffs\u2019 representation during oral argument that their market allocation\n\n20\ntheory is \u201cbased entirely [on] the settlements before Teva\u2019s launch.\u201d (Tr. at 72) (emphasis\nadded) Without any allegation of \u201csome form of concerted action\u201d or facts indicating \u201cconscious\ncommitment to a common scheme\u201d by Amgen and Teva before Teva\u2019s at-risk launch, Plaintiffs\u2019\n\u201cdelaying other generics\u201d market allocation theory fails to meet the requirements for a Section 1\nclaim. See In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 117 (3d Cir. 1999),\n\nEven assuming it is plausible that Amgen and Teva participated in a \u201ccommon scheme\u201d\nafter Teva\u2019s at-risk launch, by conspiring to exploit the grace period provided in the settlement\nagreements of other generic cinacalcet manufacturers and reaching a quick deal before the\nacceleration clauses in those agreements could be triggered (see D.I. 222 at 25-26, 29), their\nconduct still would not amount to an actionable antitrust violation. In this case, the earlier\nsettling generic cinacalcet manufacturers could not enter the market freely; instead, they had\nalready contractually agreed, before the Amgen-Teva Agreement, that they would not enter the\ngeneric cinacalcet market until long after the time period at issue here. The inclusion of the\ngrace period provisions in the settlement agreements \u2014 although allegedly at Amgen\u2019s insistence\n(see D.I. 195 5; D.I. 202 { 6) \u2014 was \u201cthe consequence of those generics\u2019 voluntary decisions to\nnegotiate terms in their settlements that they, at arm\u2019s length, believed were fair.\u201d (D.I. 212 at\n16) Under these circumstances, the Court agrees with Defendants that \u201c[t]he earlier settlers had\nno contractual expectation or right requiring Amgen to settle its other pending infringement\nclaims in a way that allowed those earlier settlers\u2019 acceleration . . . clauses to take effect\u201d (D.L.\n\n232 at 3), a proposition that Plaintiffs also \u201cagree completely with\u201d (Tr. at 72-73).16\n\n16 The case relied on by Plaintiffs, LePages\u2019 Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003), is\ninapposite. (See D.I. 222 at 27-28) LePages\u2019 does not concern a market allocation theory and\ndoes not involve market competition that had been restrained by existing contracts before the\nalleged antitrust conduct at issue took place. See also.generally King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc.\n\n21\nAdditionally, even further assuming that Amgen and Teva could have theoretically\nviolated antitrust law by avoiding triggering the acceleration clauses in the settlement agreements\nof other generic cinacalcet manufacturers, the Amgen-Teva Agreement did not, in fact, have that\neffect. As the Court found in the Cipla action, because Teva was \u201cnot found to have infringed\nthe 405 patent\u201d by Judge Goldberg, Amgen was likely \u201cprecluded from seeking (and precluded\nfrom recovering) preliminary and permanent relief in relation to Cipla\u2019s At Risk Launch of the\nCipla Product.\u201d Cipla, 386 F. Supp. 3d at 400. The same provision that the Court found\ndispositive in reaching its conclusion with respect to Cipla was included in the settlement\nagreements of at least five other generic manufacturers (see D.L. 195 \u00a5 104 n.22); thus, Cipla\u2019s\nat-risk launch would have further \u201copened the door to everyone else.\u201d (Tr. at 29-30)\n\nAlternatively, Plaintiffs ask the Court to apply the per se test to their market allocation\nclaim. (see D.I. 195 305; D.I. 202 | 280) This test is reserved, however, for agreements\n\u201cwhose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anti-competitive that no elaborate study of the\nindustry is needed to establish their illegality.\u201d Eichorn v. AT&T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 138 (3d\nCir. 2001). That situation does not pertain to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Instead, for antitrust claims\nalleging defendants have allocated a market for a patented drug, \u201ccase law uniformly supports\nthe application of Actavis and the rule of reason approach.\u201d In re Novartis & Par Antitrust Litig.,\n2019 WL 3841711, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2019) (collecting cases); see also In re Xyrem\n(Sodium Oxybate) Antitrust Litig., 2021 WL 3612497, at *31 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2021).\n\nFinally, since Plaintiffs concede that they are only challenging the Amgen-Teva\n\nAgreement the parties \u201creached in January [2019]\u201d (id. at 62), the Court need not address\n\ny. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 791 F.3d 388, 408-09 (3d Cir. 2015) (\u201cActavis does not stand for\nthe proposition that parties must reach the most procompetitive settlements possible.\u201d).\n\n22\nPlaintiffs\u2019 arguments about Amgen\u2019s \u201clater on enforcement of the agreement.\u201d!? (/d.) Relatedly,\nPlaintiffs also agree that the threatening signals Defendants sent to the marketplace, which\npurportedly impacted Cipla\u2019s decision regarding the timing and volume of its at-risk launch,\nwere \u201cbackground but . . . not actionable.\u201d (/d.)\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, then, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 1 claim based\non the theory that the Amgen-Teva Agreement delayed the entry of generic cinacalcet\nmanufacturers other than Teva must be dismissed.\n\n3. Monopolization Claims Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act\n(DPPs\u2019 Counts I and II and EPPs\u2019 Third Claim for Relief)\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Section 2 claims in the amended complaints are an amalgamation of the\n\u201cdeterrence by acceleration clauses\u201d theory, which was pled in the original complaints and\ndismissed by the Court (see D.I. 177 at 7), and a repackaged market allocation theory based on\nthe grace period, which was not pled as part of the Section 2 claims in the original complaints\n(see D.I. 12 ff 113-22; DI. 13 {J 242-48). The Court permitted the amended complaints to\ninclude \u201conly those claims and theories that remain[ed] in the case.\u201d (D.1. 177 at 17)\n(emphasis added) Hence, Plaintiffs were not granted leave to re-plead the \u201cdeterrence by\n\nacceleration clauses\u201d theory or market allocation theory based on the grace period in their\n\n17 Given Plaintiffs\u2019 concession, the positions Amgen took during the Cip/a action are not\nrelevant to the Court\u2019s analysis. In any event, it appears that Amgen\u2019s advocacy of its\ninterpretation of the Amgen-Cipla Agreement is subject to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine; the\nanticompetitive effects deriving from good-faith legal advocacy are not subject to antitrust\nliability. See Prof'l Real Estate Inv\u2019rs v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 60 (1993)\n(\u201cIf an objective litigant could conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable\noutcome, the suit is immunized under Noerr, and an antitrust claim premised on the sham\nexception must fail.\u201d). Plaintiffs do not allege that the legal arguments Amgen made about the\ninterpretation of the Amgen-Cipla Agreement were made in bad faith or were objectively\nunreasonable.\n\n23\nSection 2 claims. These portions of Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 2 claims are dismissed (or dismissed.\nagain), as further explained below.\n\nOn de novo review of Judge Hall\u2019s decision recommending dismissal of all claims in the\noriginal complaints, the Court concluded that \u201ca portion of Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 2 claims survive[d]\nthe motions to dismiss.\u201d (Id. at 7) Specifically, all that survived was the theory that Amgen\u2019s\npurported exclusionary scheme involved \u201cpaying Teva to remove its generic product from the\nmarket and delay its entry.\u201d (Jd. at 6-7) While Judge Hall had recommended that Plaintiffs be\ngranted leave to amend their complaints (see D.I. 157 at 25-26), the Court instructed that\n\u201ctbJecause the Court [had] concluded that some but not all of Plaintiffs\u2019 federal antitrust claims\nsurvive ..., it [would] promote the efficient management of these cases for the operative\ncomplaints to be re-pled to include only those claims and theories that remain in the case.\u201d (D.I.\n177 at 17) (emphasis added) Thus, Plaintiffs were granted leave to re-plead only the portion of\ntheir Section 2 claims that survived the motions to dismiss: that Amgen paid Teva to induce Teva\nto remove Teva\u2019s generic product from the market and delay its entry. (Jd. at 6-7) In the\noperative amended complaints, it appears that Plaintiffs no longer pursue this theory as part of\ntheir Section 2 claims. (Compare D.1. 13 \u00a7 244 with D.I. 195 {J 281-98) Therefore, Plaintiffs\nhave pled no Section 2 claim on which they may proceed.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Relying on Judge Hall\u2019s\nrecommendation that \u201cPlaintiff's complaints be dismissed without prejudice to amend\u201d (D.I. 157\nat 25), Plaintiffs somehow read the Court\u2019s order that their objections were \u201coverruled in part\nand sustained in part\u201d (D.I. 177 at 2) as meaning that \u201cthe part of the report that [the Court]\nsustained was the dismissal without prejudice of the monopolization claim\u201d (Tr. at 120).\n\nPlaintiffs also point to a statement in the Court\u2019s order in which the Court agreed with Judge Hall\n\n24\nthat \u201cthe market allocation theory as pled contains insufficient specificity to survive the motions\nto dismiss\u201d (D.I. 177 at 15), finding in this sentence a suggestion that Plaintiffs could try again to\nplead this theory more successfully (see D.I. 222 at 2 n.5; see also Tr. at 121), These\nunderstandings, however, are inconsistent with the explicit instructions in the Court\u2019s order that\nPlaintiffs were not permitted to re-plead the claims and theories in the original complaints that\ndid not survive the motions to dismiss.'\u00ae\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to consider the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 2 claims\nin the amended complaints, it would still find that these claims do not survive the motions to\ndismiss. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that the acceleration clauses in the settlement agreements with the\ngeneric cinacalcet manufacturers who had the weakest non-infringement positions\n\u201cdisincentivize[d] other would-be generic Sensipar competitors that held stronger patent\npositions and greater resources from launching at-risk because once they did, other generics\nwould immediately accelerate to market as well, cannibalizing the profits the early-launching\ngeneric would otherwise have enjoyed.\u201d (D.I. 195 4303; D.I. 202 { 278)\n\nThe parties fiercely dispute whether the acceleration clauses in the settlement agreements\nare procompetitive or anticompetitive. (See D.I. 212 at 18-19; D.1. 222 at 16-19; D.I. 232 at 13-\n17) Both sides cite cases seeming to side with them on this issue. See, e.g., In re Xyrem (Sodium\nOxybate) Antitrust Litig., 2021 WL 3612497, at *24 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2021) (finding\nacceleration clauses \u201cat least plausibly deterred some generics\u201d); In re Namenda Indirect\n\nPurchaser Antitrust Litig., 2021 WL 2403727, at *27 (S.D.N.Y. June 11, 2021) (finding\n\n'8 Tn addition, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u201cif there is an absence of saying with\nprejudice, then it would be without prejudice\u201d (Tr. at 41), a dismissal under Rule 12(6)(6) that is\nsilent as to prejudice is presumed to be with prejudice. See In re PHP Healthcare Corp., 128 F.\nApp\u2019x 839, 842 (3d Cir. 2005) (\u201c[I]n the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, a dismissal\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) should be presumed to be made with prejudice.\u201d).\n\n25\nargument that \u201cacceleration clauses did not change the generic market at all, and arguably\nincreased competition\u201d is \u201crather appealing\u201d); Staley v. Gilead Scis., Inc., 446 F. Supp. 3d 578,\n612 (N.D.

Supp. 3d 307, 334 (D.R.L 2017) (\u201cEPPs have plausibly alleged that the\nacceleration clause had anticompetitive effects.\u201d); In re Actos End Payor Antitrust Litig., 2015\nWL 5610752, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2015) (\u201c[A]s to the acceleration clauses, Plaintiffs have\nfailed to set forth any plausible basis for viewing them as anticompetitive.\u201d))\n\nThe Court, however, need not address this difficult question because, in this case, the\noperative clauses governing a third-party at-risk launch (Section 5.5), at least on their face, only\nprevented Amgen from seeking a preliminary injunction to enjoin the at-risk launch; they did not\nprevent Amgen from seeking infringement damages from the at-risk sales \u2014 an interpretation that\nPlaintiffs do not appear to challenge. (See D.I. 212 at 20-21; see also e.g., D.I. 243 Exs. 1-6) In\nother words, under the settlement agreements, a third-party at-risk launch would not permit\nriskless entry by other settling generics. Instead, the settling generic manufacturers would only\nhave had the opportunity to launch at risk, facing potential patent infringement damages. (See\nD.I. 212 at 20) This severely undermines any plausibility that Plaintiffs\u2019 theory might otherwise\nhave.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 reference to Section 5.6 of the settlement agreements \u2014 which, according to\nPlaintiffs (see D.I. 222 at 20-21), purportedly prevented Amgen from seeking any relief against a\ngeneric manufacturer who has launched at risk following a third-party at-risk launch \u2014 does not\nchange the Court\u2019s conclusion. Section 5.6 is present in the settlement agreements of only a\n\nminority of settling generic manufacturers, among whom only two had approved ANDAs prior\n\n26\nto 2019. (See DI. 195 Ff 104 n.22, 178, 182) Itis, thus, implausible that the alleged \u201cimmediate\nand complete genericization\u201d of the cinacalcet market would occur (or that any generic\ncontemplating an at-risk launch would assume this as an inevitability). (See DI. 195 { 107; D.I.\n202 { 102) Moreover, the amended complaints have no allegations regarding how Section 5.6\nwould impact other generic manufacturers\u2019 launch decisions.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 theory that the acceleration clauses deterred the entry of generic cinacalcet\nproducts is further undermined by the lack of actual anticompetitive effects in the marketplace.\"\nPlaintiffs allege in the amended complaints that the acceleration clauses were \u201cintended to, and\ndid, ensure that no other generic drug manufacturer \u2014 no matter how much time and resources it\nspent in its litigation against Amgen and no matter how successful it was in that litigation \u2014\ncould enter the market without other generics likewise entering the market.\u201d (D.I. 195 \u00a7 149) It\nis undisputed that this alleged deterrence did not actually occur. Instead, four non-settling\ngeneric manufacturers continued to challenge Amgen\u2019s patent through trial, even though many\nother manufacturers had previously settled their patent litigation with Amgen. (D.I. 195 ff 148,\n171; D.L 202 \u00a7\u00a5 144, 158) Moreover, besides Teva\u2019s launch, at least six generics \u2014 Cipla,\nPiramal, Mylan, Alkem, Aurobindo, and Strides \u2014 entered the market prior to their agreed entry\ndates, (D.I. 195 214, 228-30, 232; D.I. 202 {J 215, 227-29, 231) The lack of deterrence\nobserved in the generic cinacalcet market is consistent with the Court\u2019s prior conclusion that\n\n\u201cANDA filers understand that other manufacturers of generic drugs may also file ANDAs\n\n19 Th their brief, Plaintiffs contend that the continued litigation and the subsequent at-risk\nlaunches by multiple generic manufacturers \u201care factually irrelevant and cannot defeat the\nplaintiffs\u2019 monopolization claims.\u201d (D.I. 222 at 21) However, during oral argument, Plaintiffs\nconceded that \u201cthey are relevant.\u201d (Tr. at 71-72) (\u201cIf we said something how they\u2019re irrelevant,\nthen somebody got excited when typing something ....\u201d) The Court finds relevance in these\nreal-world events.\n\n27\nseeking to market their own generic versions of branded drugs, which (after FDA approval)\ncompete not only with the branded drug but also with any ANDA filer\u2019s generic product.\u201d (D.I.\n177 at 15) Again, Plaintiffs\u2019 theory lacks plausibility.\n\nPlaintiffs also allege that Amgen\u2019s purported monopolization scheme \u201cincluded Amgen\u2019s\ninjection of \u2018grace\u2019 provisions into the dozen-plus agreements with generics, giving it the\nopportunity to quickly pay off any generic that decided to launch\u201d and thereby prevent the\nacceleration clauses from being triggered. (D.I. 222 at 14; see also D.I. 195 ff 8, 9, 103; DI.\n202 4 9, 100) The Court has considered this issue in connection with Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 1\nmarket allocation claim and concludes that the utilization of grace periods to avoid the triggering\nof acceleration clauses did not amount to an antitrust violation. (See supra TII.A.2.)\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 2 claims.\n\n4. Teva\u2019s Challenge to Plaintiffs\u2019 Article I1I and Antitrust Standing\n\nTeva (but not Amgen) contends that Plaintiffs lack both Article III and antitrust standing\nto maintain their Section 1 claims that are based on the Amgen-Teva Agreement. Specifically,\nTeva argues that (1) since Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the Amgen-Teva Agreement\ndelayed generic cinacalcet manufacturers (other than Teva) from entering the market, Plaintiffs\ncannot plausibly establish that the Amgen-Teva Agreement caused Plaintiffs\u2019 purported\novercharge injury \u2014 that is, the higher prices Plaintiffs paid and reimbursed for the branded and\ngeneric Sensipar products (see D.I. 214 at 13-14); and (2) Plaintiffs have also failed to plausibly\nallege any overcharge injury caused by Teva\u2019s exit from the generic cinacalcet market under the\nAmgen-Teva Agreement (see id. at 15-19). The Court need not address Teva\u2019s first argument,\nbecause it goes to Plaintiffs\u2019 market allocation theory, which the Court has decided to dismiss.\n\n(See supra II].A.2.) Even assuming Plaintiffs have established both Article III and antitrust\n\n28\nstandings, they have failed to state a market allocation claim under the \u201cdelay other generics\u201d\ntheory. The Court will address Teva\u2019s second argument, to explain why it is not persuaded by it.\n\nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff \u201cmust have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2)\nthat is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be\nredressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016).\nCausation in the context of Article III standing is \u201cakin to \u2018but for\u2019 causation in tort and may be\nsatisfied even where the conduct in question might not have been a proximate cause of the\nharm.\u201d Finkelman v. Nat\u2019l Football League, 877 F.3d 504, 510 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\nTo establish antitrust standing, a plaintiff \u201cmust show that it has suffered an antitrust\ninjury \u2014 that is, an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows\nfrom that which makes the defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u201d In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 868\nF.3d 132, 164 (3d Cir. 2017). Unlike the causation requirement for Article III standing,\n\u201c(a|ntitrust standing requires proximate causation between defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury to\nplaintiff.\u201d Gulfstream III Assoes., Inc. v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 995 F.2d 425, 430 (3d\nCir. 1993).\n\nTeva argues that the overcharge injury Plaintiffs allege in the amended complaints\n\u201clargely, if not exclusively, assumes the continued viability of their \u2018delay of other generics\u2019\ntheory.\u201d (D.I. 214 at 15) The Court does not agree. Plaintiffs have alleged that the Amgen-Teva\nAgreement \u201celiminate[d] existing competition between Amgen and Teva and . . . prevent[ed]\nTeva from competing with Amgen by selling its generic version of Sensipar until mid-2021.\u201d\n(D.I. 195 \u00a7 313; D.I. 202 | 286) Plaintiffs have further alleged that competition by generic drug\n\nmanufacturers \u201cenables all purchasers of the drug to: (a) purchase generic versions of a drug at\n\n29\nsubstantially lower prices; (b) purchase generic equivalents of the drug at a lower price, sooner;\nand/or (c) purchase the brand drug at a reduced price.\u201d (D.L. 195 272; D.L. 202 \u00a7 245) Nothing\nin the amended complaints indicates that Plaintiffs\u2019 overcharge injury is attributable exclusively\nto the delay of entry by generic manufacturers other than Teva.\n\nTeva next contends that Plaintiffs fail to allege an injury caused by Teva\u2019s exit from the\ngeneric cinacalcet market, because the allegation that \u201cTeva sold its entire inventory of product\nforecloses any inference that there was anything Teva could have done to bring that price down\nany further.\u201d (D.I. 214 at 17) The Court has addressed this issue in connection with Amgen\u2019s\ncontention that the Amgen-Teva Agreement did not cause any delay of Teva\u2019s entry. (See supra\nIII.A.1) It is plausible at this stage to infer that Teva would have remained in the generic\ncinacalcet market absent the Amgen-Teva Agreement.\u201d\u00b0\n\nTeva\u2019s argument that \u201ceven if Teva did have additional product to sell, neither class of\nPlaintiffs alleges that it could or would have had an ability to purchase it\u201d is also unpersuasive.\n(See D.I. 214 at 17-18) The fact that Plaintiffs have not alleged that they made any purchases\n\nfrom Teva is not a dispositive failing here.?! Plaintiffs have alleged that, but for Defendants\u2019\n\n20 The situation in this case is readily distinguishable from that in the case cited by Teva. (See\nDI. 214 at 17; see also Tr. at 34-35) In Cottrell y. Alcon Labs., 874 F.3d 154, 168 (3d Cir.\n2017), the Third Circuit reversed a district court decision but added it \u201cmight be inclined to agree\nwith the District Court that the pricing theory was too speculative if it, in fact, had depended on\nthese [drug pricing] presumptions.\u201d In the district court litigation, the plaintiffs based their\ninjury theory, in part, on the presumption that \u201cDefendants would have reduced the price of a\nbottle of medication in accordance with the reduction in volume.\u201d Jd. The district court had\nrejected this premise, because it had \u201cno way of knowing whether Defendants would price their\nproducts [based on volume], particularly since the pricing of pharmaceuticals is complex.\u201d Id.\nHere, by contrast, it is far less speculative to infer \u2014 on the bases of Teva\u2019s past sales and its\nbargaining for future sales \u2014 that Teva would have continued producing and selling its generic\ncinacalcet product in the absence of the Amgen-Teva Agreement.\n\n21 Teva\u2019s reliance on Marian Bank v. Elec. Payment Servs., Inc., 1997 WL 367332 at *4 (D. Del.\nFeb. 5, 1997), is misplaced. (See D.I. 214 at 18) There the court dismissed the plaintiff's claim\n\n30\nanticompetitive conduct, they \u201cwould have paid less for oral tablets comprised of cinacalcet\nhydrochloride by: (a) substituting purchases of less-expensive AB-rated generic Sensipar for\ntheir purchases of more expensive branded Sensipar; (b) receiving discounts on their remaining\nbranded Sensipar purchases; and (c) purchasing generic cinacalcet hydrochloride at lower prices\nsooner.\u201d (D.1. 195 { 273; D.I. 202 \u00a7 245) There is no requirement that an antitrust plaintiff must\nmake purchases from a co-conspirator to sue for that co-conspirator\u2019s contribution to the antitrust\ninjury allegedly suffered by the plaintiff. See Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Co., 561 F.2d 434, 448 (3d\nCir. 1977) (\u201cThe fact that a customer has not made purchases from every co-conspirator does not\nprevent him from suing all for each co-conspirator contributed to the charging of the\nsupracompetitive price paid by the purchaser.\u201d).\n\nFinally, Teva contends that any injury Plaintiffs suffered as a result of Teva\u2019s exit from\nthe generic cinacalcet market was \u201ccompletely\u201d remedied or \u201cminimized\u201d by the entry of other\ngeneric cinacalcet products. (See D.I. 214 at 18-19) The Court agrees with Plaintiff's that this\ncontention presents an issue of damages, not standing. (See D.L. 222 at 40) Plaintiffs have\nsufficiently alleged that \u201calthough other generic manufacturers have since launched generic\nversions of Sensipar, competition in the market remains impaired as a result of the Amgen-Teva\nAgreement due to the fact that Teva is no longer selling generic Sensipar.\u201d (D.I. 202 13)\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged an overcharge\ninjury that was proximately caused by Teva\u2019s exit from the generic cinacalcet market as the\nresult of the Amgen-Teva Agreement. Thus, Plaintiffs have established both Article III standing\n\nand antitrust standing for their Section 1 claims against Teva.\n\nas to one defendant because that defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy post-dated the period\nrelevant to the plaintiff's claim.\n\n31\nB. EPPs\u2019 State Law Claims\n\nIn addition to their federal antitrust claims, the EPPs attempt to assert various state law\nclaims under the laws of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except Indiana and\nOhio. Defendants have sought to dismiss most of these state law claims on various grounds.*\n\n1. Article II Standing\n\nDefendants contend that the EPPs only have Article III standing to pursue state law\nclaims in 15 states because the EPPs\u2019 amended complaint lacks allegations that the named\nplaintiffs were injured outside of those 15 states. (See D.I. 210 at 5) The EPPs counter that\nthey have Article III standing to pursue their claims and those of absent class members, because\n\u201call claims arise from the same alleged misconduct.\u201d (D.I. 224 at 3) In the EPPs\u2019 view, \u201ca\nplaintiff's ability to represent the claims held by absent class members is not\u201d an Article III\njurisdictional issue. (Jd. at 5)\n\nOn this dispute, the Court agrees with Defendants.24 The EPPs may only proceed with\ntheir state law claims in the 15 states where at least one named plaintiff was injured by allegedly\n\noverpaying for branded and generic Sensipar. (See D.L. 202 {fj 19-21)\n\n22 According to Defendants, the only state law claims that are not subject to the motion to\ndismiss are: the Florida consumer protection claim; the California consumer protection claim and\nantitrust claims as to concerted conduct; New York and Tennessee antitrust claims as to\nconcerted conduct; and the Arizona, Maryland, and Oregon claims. (See D.L. 210 at 3 n.1)\n\n23 The 15 states are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri,\nNew Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah.\n\n24 The issue of Article III standing in class action lawsuits presents an unsettled question on\nwhich courts, including in the Third Circuit, are split. See, e.g., In re Valsartan, Losartan, &\nIrbesartan Prods. Liab. Litig., 2021 WL 100204, at *14 (D.N.J. Jan. 12, 2021) (finding no\nstanding in states where named plaintiffs \u201cdo not reside and were not injured\u201d); Ponzio v.\nMercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 447 F. Supp. 3d 194, 223 (D.N.J. 2020) (\u201cPlaintiffs lack standing to\nassert claims on behalf of unnamed plaintiffs in jurisdictions where Plaintiffs have suffered no\nalleged injury.\u201d); In re Niaspan Antitrust Litig., 42 F. Supp. 3d 735, 758 (E.D. Pa. 2014)\n\n32\nUnder Third Circuit law, \u201c[s]tanding requires that the party seeking to invoke federal\njurisdiction \u2018demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.\u2019\u201d Neale v. Volvo Cars of N.\nAm., LLC, 794 F.3d 353, 359 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S.\n332, 352 (2006)) (emphasis added). \u201cThe requirements for standing do not change in the class\naction context.\u201d Jn re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data Breach Litig., 846 F.3d 625, 634 (3d\nCir. 2017). In class actions, Article III standing \u201cmust be satisfied by at least one named\nplaintiff,\u201d while \u201cunnamed, putative class members need not establish Article III standing.\u201d\nNeale, 794 F.3d at 359, 362 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[N]amed plaintiffs who\nrepresent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has\nbeen suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they\npurport to represent.\u201d Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Long v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth,, 903 F.3d 312, 325 (3d Cir. 2018) (\u201c[A]ny harm\nto unnamed class members cannot constitute injury in fact.\u201d).\n\nApplying these principles here is fairly straightforward, especially considering that the\nEPPs have conceded: (i) the named plaintiffs only have suffered injuries in the 15 states, and\n(ii) the fact that the named plaintiffs incurred injuries in those 15 states does not confer on them\nArticle III standing in states beyond the 15 (see Tr. at 104-05). The EPPs cannot premise Article\n\nIII standing for claims outside of the 15 states on the injuries allegedly suffered by putative,\n\n(\u201c[N]amed plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims under the laws of the states in which they do\nnot reside or in which they suffered no injury.\u201d); but see, e.g., Inre Generic Pharms. Pricing\nAntitrust Litig., 368 F. Supp. 3d 814, 831 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (declining to dismiss case because\n\u201cstate law claims of the named [plaintiffs] largely parallel those of the putative class members\u201d);\nGress v. Freedom Mortg. Corp., 386 F. Supp. 3d 455, 462 (M.D. Pa. 2019) (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 capacity\nto state claims under the laws of other states on behalf of putative class members . . . is a matter\nto be decided under the rubric of Rule 23\u201d and is not issue of standing).\n\n33\nunnamed class members in other states. Accordingly, the EPPs have Article III standing only for\nclaims in the 15 states. See Neale, 794 F.3d at 359.\n\nThe EPPs\u2019 reliance on non-Third Circuit cases is misplaced; at least some of those cases\nare inconsistent with binding Third Circuit law. For example, the Second Circuit held that\n\u201c[named] class action plaintiffs are not required to have individual standing to press any of the\nclaims belonging to their unnamed class members.\u201d Langan v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer\nCos., Inc., 897 F.3d 88, 95 (2d Cir. 2018). This conclusion is at odds with Neale\u2019s holding that\nArticle III standing \u201cmust be satisfied by at least one named plaintiff\u201d in class actions. See\nNeale, 794 F.3d at 359. The First Circuit found that named plaintiffs have Article [II standing to\nassert claims held by absent class members where the claims of the named plaintiff's \u201cparallel\u201d\nthose of the putative unnamed class members. See In re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d 42, 49\n(1st Cir. 2018). Under Third Circuit law, however, courts \u201cdo not exercise jurisdiction over one\nclaim simply because it arose from the same nucleus of operative fact as another claim.\u201d Neale,\n794 F.3d at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted).\u201d\u00b0\n\nThe Court finds no need to defer addressing the Article III standing issue until after class\ncertification, an approach adopted in some cases cited by the EPPs (see D.I. 224 at 5-6), cases\nthat relied on the reasoning of Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (1997), in which\nthe Supreme Court was asked to review both class certification issues and the Article III standing\n\nof some, but not all, class members. In that case, the Supreme Court agreed with the Court of\n\n25 The other appellate court cases cited by the EPPs do not address the disputed issue here. The\nFourth Circuit decision in Mayor of Baltimore v. Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 995 F.3d 123,\n131 (4th Cir. 2021), addressed statutory standing, not Article III standing. The Sixth Circuit and\nSeventh Circuit decisions allowed named plaintiffs to assert the same federal law claims as the\nputative class members. See Fallick v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 162 F.3d 410, 423 (6th Cir.\n1998); Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 790, 795 (7th Cir. 2008).\n\n34\nAppeals that the class certification issues were dispositive and the other issues \u201cwould not exist\nbut for the class-action certification.\u201d Amchem, 521 U.S. at 612. Thus, the Supreme Court found\nthat it was appropriate in Amchem to reach the class certification issues first, \u201cbecause their\nresolution here is logically antecedent to the existence of any Article III issues.\u201d Id. Amchem\ndid not, however, require that courts always address class certification before standing. Here,\nsince the Court is only confronted with a challenge to Article III standing, and has not yet\nreached the stage of considering class certification, there would be no practical benefit to waiting\nto decide standing until after a decision on class certification. See generally Flecha v.\nMedicredit, Inc., 946 F.3d 762, 769 (Sth Cir. 2020) (\u201c[I]f it is the class representative who\npresents a standing problem, then hat standing issue must be addressed first, prior to deciding\nclass certification. After all, if the class representative lacks standing, then there is no Article III\nsuit to begin with \u2014 class certification or otherwise.\u201d).\n\nFor these reasons, the Court agrees with Defendants that the EPPs lack Article If\nstanding to press their state law claims except in the following 15 states: Alaska, Arizona,\nCalifornia, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon,\nPennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah. Their state law claims in all other\njurisdictions will be dismissed without prejudice.\n\n2. Antitrust and Consumer Protection Statutes\n\nDefendants contend that several of the EPPs\u2019 state-law antitrust and consumer protection\nclaims should be dismissed because these claims are not allowed under relevant state statutes.\nSpecifically, Defendants argue that (1) the EPPs\u2019 Sixth Claim for Relief against Amgen should\nbe dismissed under California, New York, and Tennessee law, because these state statutes do not\n\nprohibit unilateral conduct (see D.I. 210 at 10); (2) the EPPs\u2019 claims under Hawaii law should be\n\n35\ndismissed for failure to comply with the statutory notice requirement (see id. at 11); (3) the\nEPPs\u2019 claims under Missouri consumer protection law should be dismissed because the named\nplaintiffs are not \u201cconsumers\u201d (see id. at 12); and (4) the EPPs\u2019 claims under Utah law should be\ndismissed because none of the named plaintiffs is a citizen or resident of Utah (see id. at 12).\nThe Court addresses each of Defendants\u2019 challenges below.\n\na. California, New York, and Tennessee\n\nDefendants contend that the EPPs\u2019 monopolization claims \u201cagainst Amgen alone\u201d (D.I.\n202 F{ 324-32) fail as a matter of law because the statutes of California, New York, and\nTennessee \u201cprohibit only concerted conduct, not unilateral conduct.\u201d\u00ae (D.I. 210 at 10) The\nEPPs do not dispute Defendants\u2019 interpretation of the law. Instead, they point out that they have\npled concerted conduct, including Amgen\u2019s conspiracy with Teva and its settlements with other\ngeneric manufacturers. (See D.I. 224 at 10)\n\nThe Court agrees with the EPPs. The statutes at issue do not prohibit claims against one\nco-conspirator who participated in a concerted scheme. Thus, the mere fact that the claims are\ndirected \u201cagainst Amgen alone\u201d does not form a basis for dismissal.\n\nThe concerted conduct alleged in the EPPs\u2019 amended complaint is readily distinguishable\n\nfrom the conduct that courts have found to be unilateral in nature. See, e.g., Commonwealth\n\n%6 California\u2019s Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 16720, \u201capplies only to a \u2018combination\u2019\ninvolving \u2018two or more persons,\u2019 not to unilateral conduct.\u201d Flagship Theatres of Palm Desert,\nLLC v. Century Theatres, Inc., 198 Cal. App. 4th 1366, 1386 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011).

Supp. 3d 395, 420-21 (D.N.J. 2018) (fraudulently obtaining patent, listing fraudulently\nobtained patent in Orange Book, filing sham citizen petition, and engaging in sham litigation).\n\nThus, the Court will not dismiss the EPPs\u2019 Sixth Claim for Relief against Amgen under\nCalifornia, New York, and Tennessee statutes?\u201d\n\nb. Hawaii\n\nDefendants contend that the antitrust claims brought under Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 480, et\nseq. should be dismissed because the EPPs failed to comply with the statutory notice\nrequirement. (See D.I. 210 at 11) Section 480-13.3 of the Hawaii statute sets forth detailed\nprocedural requirements for maintaining a class action for trade violation claims on behalf of\nindirect purchasers by a person other than the state\u2019s attorney general. The statute requires that\nthe proposed class representative file a complaint under seal and serve, among other things, a\nfiled copy of the complaint upon the attorney general, \u201cnot later than seven days after filing of\nthe complaint.\u201d Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 480-13.3(a)(1). The attorney general then has the discretion\nto take over the class action, or to file its own action on the same or similar claims, and in the\nlatter case the proposed class representative\u2019s complaint \u201cshall be dismissed.\u201d Haw. Rev. Stat.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 480-13.3(a)(4), (a)(5)(A) and (a)(5)(B). If the attorney general declines or fails to timely take\n\n21 See Inre Effexor Antitrust Litig., 357 F. Supp. 3d 363, 395 (D.N.J. 2018) (upholding New\nYork and Tennessee claims based on reverse settlement agreement); Lipitor, 336 F. Supp. 3d at\n421 (same).\n\n37\nover the action or to file its own action, the proposed class representative \u201cshall have the right\u201d to\nproceed with its class action. Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 480-13.3(a)(5)(C).\n\nWhile the EPPs assert that they have provided notice to the Hawaii attorney general (see\nD.I. 224 at 11), they failed to do so in compliance with the statutory requirements.\u201d* See Haw.\nRev. Stat. \u00a7 480-13.3(a)(1). The EPPs contend, nonetheless, that their claims should not be\ndismissed because, following Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in Shady Grove Orthopedic\nAssociates, P.A. y. Allstate Insurance Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), \u201cRule 23 preempts state laws\nrestricting class actions.\u201d (D.I. 224 at 11) Defendants counter that Justice Stevens\u2019 concurrence,\nrather than Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion, is the controlling analysis in Shady Grove. (See\nD.1. 233 at 5) Under that analysis, Hawaii\u2019s notice requirement governing indirect purchasers\u2019\nantitrust class action lawsuits \u2014 which, according to Defendants, are \u201cpart of a State\u2019s framework\nof substantive rights or remedies,\u201d Shady Grove, 559 U.S. at 419 (Stevens, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in the judgment) \u2014 should apply in federal court. (See D.J. 233 at 5) The Court\nagrees with Defendants.\n\nIn Shady Grove, 559 U.S. at 398-401, a majority of the Supreme Court agreed that Rule\n23 directly conflicts with New York\u2019s statute precluding class actions seeking penalties or\nstatutory minimum damages. The Supreme Court, however, was split on the issue of when Rule\n23 preempts a conflicting state class action statute. In the plurality opinion, Justice Scalia\nconcluded that Rule 23 preempts all state class action statutes, regardless of the \u201csubstantive\n\nnature\u201d or \u201csubstantive purpose\u201d of the state law. Jd. at 409. By contrast, Justice Stevens, in his\n\n28 The EPPs filed their original complaint on February 21, 2019 (see C.A. No. 19-369, D.L. 1)\nand \u201cenclose[d]\u201d a copy of the complaint in letters sent to the attorney general \u201con or about April\n30, 2019.\u201d (See D.I. 202 \u00a7 274) The EPPs also provided a notice to the Hawaii attorney general\nten days after filing their second amended complaint. (See D.I. 224 Ex. A)\n\n38\nopinion concurring in the judgment, espoused the view that when a federal rule and a state\nstatute directly conflict, the federal rule \u201ccannot govern a particular case in which the rule would\ndisplace a state law that is . . . so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to\ndefine the scope of the state-created right.\u201d Jd. at 423. Although the Third Circuit has not\naddressed the issue, the Court finds that the opinion of Justice Stevens, who \u201cconcurred in the\njudgments on the narrowest grounds,\u201d provides the controlling analysis of Shady Grove. See\nMarks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977). This is the same conclusion reached by a\nmajority of courts that have addressed the same issue. See, e.g., Albright v. Christensen, 24 F 4th\n1039, 1044 n.1 (6th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e restate our conclusion . . . that Justice Stevens\u2019s\nconcurrence in Shady Grove controls the test governing the [Rule Enabling Act] and\nconstitutional standards.\u201d); James River Ins. Co. v. Rapid Funding, LLC, 658 F.3d 1207, 1217\n(10th Cir. 2011) (\u2018The Tenth Circuit has understood [Justice Stevens\u2019] concurrence to be the\ncontrolling opinion in Shady Grove.\u201d); Greene v. Gerber Prods. Co., 262 F. Supp. 3d 38, 60\n(E.D.N.Y. 2017) (collecting cases and agreeing with \u201cthe majority of district and circuit courts\nthat have found Justice Stevens\u2019 concurring opinion controls because it provides the \u2018narrowest\ngrounds\u2019 or the \u2018common denominator\u2019 of the majority position); Phillips v. Philip Morris Co.,\n290 F.R.D. 476, 480-81 (N.D. Ohio 2013) (collecting cases and concluding \u201c[i]n the wake of\nShady Grove, a clear majority of courts have applied Stevens\u2019s narrower holding as the\ncontrolling opinion for use in determining whether a federal rule may displace a conflicting state\nlaw\u2019).\n\nThe Court finds that Hawaii\u2019s notice requirement \u201cfunctions to define the scope of the\nstate-created right\u201d and is not, therefore, preempted. Shady Grove, 559 U.S. at 423. First, unlike\n\nthe New York statute at issue in Shady Grove, which \u201capplies not only to claims based on New\n\n39\nYork law but also to claims on federal law or the law of any other State,\u201d id. at 432, the notice\nrequitement in the Hawaii statute applies only to \u201c[a] class action for claims for a violation of\nthis chapter [i.e., Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 480, ef seq.].\u201d Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 480-13.3. The specific\napplicability of the notice requirement suggests that it is \u201cbound up\u201d with the substantive right\ncreated by Hawaii law. See Greene v. Gerber Prods. Co., 262 F. Supp. 3d 38, 61 (E.D.N.Y.\n2017) (finding that notice prerequisite applying only to \u201ca violation of Chapter 1345 of the [Ohio\nRevised Code]\u201d indicates \u201cits substantive nature\u201d); In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig.,\n968 F. Supp. 2d 367, 408-09 (D. Mass. 2013) (finding Illinois\u2019 requirement that all indirect\npurchaser class actions be brought by attorney general is substantive, as it is \u201ccontained in the\nstate\u2019s antitrust statute\u201d).\n\nThe text of the Hawaii statute further indicates that the notice requirement defines the\nscope of a state-created right. The statute states that the notice requirement \u201cshall not limit the\nrights of consumers to bring class actions,\u201d suggesting that the notice requirement is intended to\nlimit indirect purchasers\u2019 rights to bring class actions. (See D.I. 210 at 11 n.4; see also Haw.\nRev. Stat. \u00a7 480-13.3(b) (emphasis added)) The statute also specifies that the proposed class\nrepresentative \u201cshall have the right\u201d to conduct the class action if the state does not take it over,\nfurther suggesting that the right to conduct class actions does not vest until after the state has\nexercised its right of first refusal. See Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 480-13.3(a)(5)(C) (emphasis added).\nHence, disregarding the notice requirement would impermissibly \u201cabridge, enlarge or modify\u201d\n\nthe substantive right granted by the Hawaii statute.\u201d See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b).\n\n29 But see Inre Aggrenox Antitrust Litig., 94 F. Supp. 3d 224, 253-54 (D. Conn. 2015) (finding\nthat Hawaii\u2019s procedural requirements are not sufficiently part of its framework of substantive\nrights or remedies).\n\n40\nFor these reasons, since the EPPs failed to comply with the statutory notice requirement,\n\ntheir antitrust claims brought under the Hawaii statute will be dismissed.*\nc. Missouri\n\nDefendants contend that the EPPs\u2019 claims under the Missouri Merchandising Practices\nAct (MMPA), Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 407.025(1), should be dismissed because that statute authorizes\n\u201conly claims by consumers who pay for a product for their own use.\u201d (D.I. 210 at 12) (emphasis\nadded) The EPPs respond that their proposed class includes both benefit plan plaintiffs and\nconsumers who paid for Sensipar indirectly. (See D.I. 224 at 12; see also D.1. 202 \u00a7 264) As to\nthe benefit plan plaintiffs, the EPPs argue that they paid for the \u201cpersonal and/or household use\u201d\nof the individual consumers in the plans. (See D.I. 224 at 12)\n\nThe Missouri statute provides a private cause of action for \u201c[aJny person who purchases\nor leases merchandise primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\u201d?! Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\n\n407.025(1). Like many district courts that have considered the same issue,\u201d this Court\n\n30 Several courts have found that the Hawaii statute does not require dismissal for failure to\ncomply with procedural requirements. See, e.g., In re Aftermarket Filters Antitrust Litig., 2009\nWL 3754041, at *6 (NLD. Ill. Nov. 5, 2009); In re Propranolol Antitrust Litig., 249 F. Supp 3d\n712, 728 n.14 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); Sergeants Benevolent Ass\u2019n Health & Welfare Fund v. Actavis,\nplc, 2018 WL 7197233, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 26, 2018). While the statute is silent on the\nproper remedy for non-compliance with its procedural requirements, the Court concludes that the\nEPPs have acquired no right to conduct class actions without affording the state attorney general\nthe right of first refusal. It follows that their antitrust claims should be dismissed. See, \u00a2.g.,\nAsacol, 2016 WL 4083333, at *15; Lipitor, 336 F. Supp. 3d at 416; In re Chocolate\nConfectionary Antitrust Litig., 749 F. Supp. 2d 224, 232-33 (M.D. Pa. 2010); In re Fi lash\nMemory Antitrust Litig., 643 F. Supp. 2d 1133, 1158 (N.D. Cal. 2009).\n\n31 The Missouri statute defines \u201cperson\u201d to include business entities. See Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\n407.010(5).\n\n32 A Missouri state court has held that plaintiffs who purchase merchandise indirectly from\ndefendants can seek damages under this statute, but has not addressed the issue of whether the\nstatute authorizes claims of plaintiffs who purchase \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 merchandise for\nsomeone else\u2019s personal use. See State v. Polley, 2 S.W.3d 887, 891-92 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999)\n\n41\nconcludes that the statute should be construed to authorize only claims brought by persons who\nhave purchased merchandise for their own \u2014 but not someone else\u2019s \u2014 \u201cpersonal, family or\nhousehold purposes.\u201d See, e.g., Inre Express Scripts, Inc., 2006 WL 2632328, at *10 (E.D. Mo.\nSept. 13, 2006); Asacol, 2016 WL 4083333, at *12; Los Gatos Mercantile, Inc., v. EI. DuPont\nDe Nemours & Co., 2015 WL 4755335, at *23 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 11, 2015); In re Actimmune\nMktg. Litig., 2010 WL 3463491, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 1, 2010); In re Pharm. Indus. Average\nWholesale Price Litig., 252 F.R.D. 83, 97 n.13 (D. Mass. 2008). A contrary interpretation would\nbe at odds with the \u201cfundamental purpose of the Act: the protection of consumers.\u201d Gibbons v.\nJ. Nuckolls, Inc., 216 S.W.3d 667, 669 (Mo. 2007).\n\nHere, since the benefit plan plaintiffs did not purchase Sensipar for their own use, the\nMMPA does not authorize their claims. However, individual consumers who indirectly\npurchased Sensipar for their own personal use may press claims under the MMPA. See Jn re\nGeneric Pharms. Pricing Antitrust Litig., 368 F. Supp. 3d 814, 847 (E.D. Pa. 2019).\n\nDefendants contend that the Court can only consider whether \u201cthe named plaintiffs have\nplausible claims.\u201d (D.I. 233 at 5) While only named plaintiffs are considered for Article III\nstanding purposes (as the Court has held elsewhere in this Opinion (see supra Ii1.B.1.)),\nDefendants cite no authority to support their contention that the Court must do the same with\n\nrespect to the merits elements of a claim. Hence, since the MMPA authorizes claims for at least\n\n(consumer\u2019s home-tepair materials and services purchased indirectly from construction\nbusiness); Gibbons v. J. Nuckolls, Inc., 216 S.W.3d 667, 669-70 (Mo. 2007) (consumer\u2019s\nautomobile purchased indirectly from automobile wholesaler). Consistent with the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of the statute, these state court cases permit consumer-plaintiffs to proceed with\nclaims if they have purchased (albeit indirectly) merchandise for their own personal use, not for\nsomeone else\u2019s personal use.\n\n42\nsome putative class members, the Court will not dismiss the EPPs\u2019 claims under this statute, and\nwill deny this portion of the Defendants\u2019 motion.\nd. Utah\n\nDefendants contend that the EPPs\u2019 claims under the Utah statute should be dismissed\nbecause the statute provides that \u201c[a] person who is a citizen of [Utah] or a resident of [Utah] .. .\nmay bring an action.\u201d Utah Code 76-10-3109(1)(a). According to Defendants, none of the\nnamed plaintiffs allege that they are citizens or residents of Utah. (See D.I. 210 at 12-13) In\nresponse, the EPPs argue that the unnamed plaintiffs in the putative class may satisfy this\nstatutory requirement. (See D.I. 224 at 13) Although the EPPs do not explicitly allege that any\nputative class member is a citizen or resident of Utah, they do, however, allege that the putative\nclasses include persons and entities that \u201cindirectly purchased, paid, and/or provided\nreimbursement\u201d in Utah. (D.I. 202 4 264) It is, thus, not implausible to infer that some of those\nputative class members may be citizens or residents of Utah. Thus, the Court will not dismiss\nthe EPPs\u2019 claims brought under the Utah statute.\n\nc. Unjust Enrichment Claims\n\n1, Alaska, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina\n\nDefendants seek dismissal of the EPPs\u2019 state law unjust enrichment claims in the listed\n\n\u201cnon-Illinois Brick repealer\u201d states because these claims attempt to circumvent the prohibition on\n\nindirect purchasers\u2019 antitrust damages claims.\u00b0? (See DI. 210 at 13) The Court agrees with\n\n33 Defendants also include Florida in this category. However, the I/linois Brick doctrine does not\nprevent the EPPs from bringing claims under the Florida Deceptive & Unfair Trade Practices Act\n(\u201cFDUTPA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.201, et seg. See Mack v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 673 So. 2d\n100, 110-11 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996); In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litig., 290 F. Supp. 3d\n772, 819-20 (N.D. Ill. 2017). Thus, Minis Brick does not provide a basis for dismissing the\nEPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim under Florida law.\n\n43\nDefendants and will dismiss the EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims as pled under Alaska,*4 New\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina law.\n\nUnder the Illinois Brick doctrine, indirect purchasers may not recover damages from an\nantitrust defendant. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 730 (1977). However, many\nstates have enacted statutes that do authorize indirect purchasers to bring antitrust claims seeking\nmonetary damages, effectively \u201crepealing\u201d the effect of [inois Brick (for purposes of state law\nclaims). Other states, however, have not attempted to \u201crepeal\u201d Illinois Brick by statute. In these\n\u201cnon-repealet\u201d states, \u201cit would be inequitable to permit relief where the state has clearly made a\npolicy determination that no such relief should lie.\u201d In re Packaged Seafood Prods. Antitrust\nLitig., 242 F. Supp. 3d 1033, 1088-89 (S.D. Cal. 2017).\n\nNotwithstanding the several cases cited by the EPPs holding the contrary (see, e.g., D.I.\n224 at 15-16), the weight of authority supports the proposition that indirect purchasers may not\nbring state law claims for unjust enrichment if that state\u2019s antitrust and consumer protection\nstatutes do not otherwise provide a private cause of action for damages. See, e.g., In re Flonase\nAntitrust Litig., 692 F. Supp. 2d 524, 542 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (\u201c[W]here an antitrust defendant\u2019s\nconduct cannot give rise to liability under state antitrust and consumer protection laws, Plaintiffs\nshould be prohibited from recovery under a claim for unjust enrichment.\u201d); In re K-Dur Antitrust\nLitig., 2008 WL 2660780, at *5 (D.N.J. Feb, 28, 2008) (\u201c[A] plaintiff cannot circumvent the\nstatutory framework by recasting an antitrust claim as one for unjust enrichment.\u201d); Jn re\n\nTerazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 160 F. Supp. 2d 1365, 1380 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (\u201cState\n\n34 Alaska allows only the state attomey general to bring antitrust claims on behalf of those\nindirectly harmed. See Alaska Stat. Ann. \u00a7 45.50.577(4).\n\n44\nlegislatures and courts that adopted the I/linois Brick rule against indirect purchaser antitrust\nsuits did not allow \u2018an end run around the policies allowing only direct purchasers to recover.\u2019\u201d).\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims in Alaska, New\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.\n\n2. Hawaii, Missouri, and Utah\n\nDefendants contend that in these states \u2014 all of which provide statutory remedies for\nindirect purchasers \u2014 the EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims should be dismissed because their\nstatutory claims fail. (See D.I. 210 at 13) Having concluded that the EPPs\u2019 statutory claims in\nMissouri and Utah survive the motion to dismiss, the Court only needs to address the EPPs\u2019\nunjust enrichment claim in Hawaii.\n\nThe Court does not find that Hawaii\u2019s antitrust statutes provide the exclusive remedies\nfor antitrust claims brought by indirect purchasers. See generally Miller v. French, 530 U.S.\n327, 340-41 (2000) (stating courts \u201cshould not construe a statute to displace courts\u2019 traditional\nequitable authority absent the clearest command\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nDefendants fail to show such a \u201cclear[] command\u201d here. It follows, then, that the EPPs\u2019 right to\nrecover an equitable remedy is not entirely dependent on the success of their statutory antitrust\nclaims. (See D.I. 224 at 15) Moreover, as the EPPs rightly argue, under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 8(d), the EPPs are permitted to plead causes of action in the alternative, even if they\nare premised on the same factual basis. (See id. at 14-15) Thus, the dismissal of EPP\u2019s statutory\nantitrust claims does not necessarily require the dismissal of their unjust enrichment claims,\n\nwhich may proceed as an alternative cause of action.\n\n45\nThus, the Court will not dismiss the EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims under Hawaii,\n\nMissouri, and Utah law.?\u00b0\n3. Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania\n\nDefendants contend that the EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims in these states should be\ndismissed because the law of these states requires a benefit that is conveyed from a plaintiff to a\ndefendant directly. (See D.J. 210 at 14) Since the Court will dismiss the EPPs\u2019 unjust\nenrichment claims in New Jersey and Pennsylvania based on the continued viability of [inois\nBrick in these states (see above), the Court will only address this additional argument in\nconnection with the EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims under Florida and New York law.\n\nThe Court will dismiss the EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim under Florida law. The\nFlorida Supreme Court has held that \u201cto prevail on an unjust enrichment claim, the plaintiff must\ndirectly confer a benefit to the defendant.\u201d Kopel v. Kopel, 229 So. 3d 812, 818 (Fla. 2017). For\nexample, a party to a contract cannot assert an unjust enrichment claim against another party to a\ndifferent contract even if a benefit can arguably flow through a third party common to both\ncontracts. See, e.g., Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank of Commerce v. First Union Nat'l Bank of Fla., N.A.,\n667 So. 2d 876, 878-79 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996). The Court must apply this definitive\nconstruction of Florida law by the Florida Supreme Court. The EPPs, representing the indirect\npurchasers, have not alleged that any putative class member directly conferred a benefit to any\nDefendant. The cases cited by the EPPs (see, \u00a2.g., D.I. 224 at 17) all predated Kopel. The Court\n\nwill follow Kopel and, hence, dismiss this claim.\n\n35 For the same reasons, the Court will not dismiss the unjust enrichment claims as duplicative\nwhere the EPPs have plausibly pled any statutory claim in a particular state. (See D.I. 210 at 19)\n\n46\nUnder New York law, \u201ca plaintiff need not be in privity with the defendant to state a\nclaim for unjust enrichment.\u201d Sperry v. Crompton Corp., 863 N.E.2d 1012, 1018 (N.Y. 2007).\nHowever, such a claim is not permitted when the relationship between the plaintiff and the\ndefendant is \u201ctoo attenuated.\u201d Jd. New York courts have found, for example, that end users\ncannot assert an unjust enrichment claim against the manufacturer of an ingredient of the\nproduct they purchased. See id. (dismissing claim by purchasers of tires against defendants who\nfixed prices for chemical additives in tires); see also State ex. rel. Spitzer v. Daicel Chem Indus.,\nLtd., 840 N.Y.S.2d 8, 12 (N.Y. App. Div. 2007) (dismissing claim by consumers of food\nproducts against defendants who fixed prices of additives used to extend food\u2019s shelf life). Here,\nthe EPPs indirectly purchase the product at issue: Sensipar or generic cinacalcet; they are not\ntrying to sue, for example, a company that provides ingredients that Defendants put into Sensipar\nor generic cinacalcet. Hence, the relationship between the EPPs and Defendants is not \u201ctoo\nattenuated.\u201d See, e.g., Jn re DDAVP Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 903 F. Supp. 2d 198,\n234 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (denying motion to dismiss because \u201cPlaintiffs plausibly conferred some\nbenefit on Defendants, albeit indirectly, by purchasing DDAVP at elevated prices\u201d); Waldman y.\nNew Chapter, Inc., 714 F. Supp. 2d 398, 403-04 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that indirect\npurchaser can assert unjust enrichment claim \u201cagainst the manufacturer of the product itself\u201d).\nThe Court will not dismiss EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim based on New York law.\n\n4. California\n\nDefendants contend that California does not recognize unjust enrichment as a standalone\nclaim. (See D.I. 210 at 14) While some courts have agreed with this position, see, e.g., Melchior\ny. New Line Prods, Inc., 106 Cal. App. 4th 779, 793 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018unjust\n\nenrichment\u2019 does not describe a theory of recovery.\u201d), other courts, including the Supreme Court\n\n47\nof California, appear to acknowledge that parties may pursue unjust enrichment claims under\nCalifornia law. See, e.g., Ghirardo v. Antonioli, 924 P.2d 996, 1002 (Cal. 1996) (holding that\nplaintiff can assert unjust enrichment claim where his claim seeks restitution and other remedies\nare inadequate); Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Dintino, 167 Cal. App. 4th 333, 346 (Cal. Ct. App.\n2008) (\u201c[U]njust enrichment is a common law obligation implied by law based on the equities of\na particular case.\u201d). The California courts have not definitively prohibited an independent cause\nof action for unjust enrichment. Thus, the Court will not dismiss the EPPs\u2019 unjust enrichment\nclaim brought under California law.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nAn appropriate Order follows.\n\n48\n"}
