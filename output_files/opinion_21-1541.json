No. 22-1541-GBW\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPetitioner is an inmate at the James T. Correctional Center in Smyrna,\nDelaware. He has filed a blank form application for habeas relief along with\npapers which appear to be challenging a foreclosure and other unidentified legal\nproceedings. He asserts that the Delaware courts lacked jurisdiction over his\n\nproceedings because he is a \u201cMoorish American.\u201d (D.I. 5; D.I. 6)\nIl. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nA district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\nof someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground\nthat his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). Notably,\na district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \u201cif it plainly appears from\nthe face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not\nentitled to relief.\u201d Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.\nIi. DISCUSSION\n\nAlthough not entirely clear, Petitioner appears to be challenging a\nforeclosure and issues concerning a trust and mortgage; the relief he seeks is a\n\u201cfull accounting.\u201d (D.I. 5; D.L. 7) He does not identify or challenge the state\ncriminal proceeding for which he is incarcerated, and he does not ask to be\nreleased from his incarceration. These deficiencies in Petitioner\u2019s pleadings\nprovide a sufficient basis for summary dismissal.\n\nNevertheless, to the extent Petitioner may challenging the validity of his\ncriminal conviction, and is arguing that the Delaware courts lacked jurisdiction to\nconvict him because he is of Moorish descent, his argument has no basis in law or\n\nfact. Regardless of Petitioner\u2019s nationality or religion, he is subject to the laws of\n\n2\nthe jurisdiction in which he resides. See Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section\n2254 Cases in the United States District Court, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254 (authorizing\nsummary dismissal of \u00a7 2254 applications); see, e.g., Jones-Bey v. Alabama, 2014\nWL 1233826, at *3 (N.D. Ala. Mar. 25, 2014) (\u201cThere is no basis in the law for\nsuch a claim\u201d that the State of Alabama did not have jurisdiction to prosecute and\nimprison petitioner based on his ancestry as a \u201cMoorish American.\u201d); Bey v.\nBailey, 2010 WL 1531172, at *4 (S.D.N-Y. Apr. 15, 2010) (\u201cthe suggestion that\nPetitioner is entitled to ignore the laws of the State of New York by claiming\nmembership in the Moorish-American nation is without merit and cannot be the\nbasis for habeas relief.\u201d); Osiris v. Brown, 2005 WL 2044904, at *2-*3 (D. N.J.\nAug. 24, 2005); see also Byrd v. Blackman, 2006 WL 2924446, at *1 n.1 (E.D. Pa.\nOct. 5, 2006) (explaining the background of the Moorish beliefs). Therefore,\nPetitioner\u2019s status as a \u201cMoorish American\u201d does not provide a viable challenge to\nany criminal conviction he may be challenging.\n\nFor these reasons, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Petition\nbecause Petitioner has failed to assert a basis for federal habeas relief.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, the Court will summarily dismiss Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 Petition.\nThe Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner\nhas failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, 113\n\nF.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order follows.\n\naw\nDated: February iN , 2023\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nPERNELL STROMAN,\nPetitioner,\nV. i C.A. No. 22-1541-GBW\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nORDER\nOne\n\nAt Wilmington, this day of February 2023, for the reasons set forth\nin the Memorandum issued this date;\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1. Petitioner Pernell Stroman\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (D.I. 1; D.I. 5; D.I. 6) is DISMISSED for failure to\nassert issues cognizable on federal habeas review.\n\n2.
