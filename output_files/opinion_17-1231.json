INTRODUCTION Civil Action No. 17-1231-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nIn January 2015, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of drug \ndealing, aggravated possession of heroin, possession of drug paraphernalia, two counts \nof first degree reckless endangering, disregarding a police officer's signal, and reckless \ndriving. (D.I. 34 at 2); see also State v. Ellerbe, 2016 WL 4119863, at *1 (Del. Super. \nCt. Aug. 2, 2016). The Superior Court sentenced him to eighteen years of \nimprisonment at Level V, followed by decreasing levels of supervision. (D.I. 34 at 2); \nsee also Ellerbe, 2016 WL 4119863, at *1. Petitioner filed a notice of appeal. (D.I. 34 \nat 2) In August 2015, while his appeal was pending, Petitioner filed a pro se motion for \nreduction of sentence. (Id. at 2-3) The Superior Court deferred decision on the motion \nduring the pendency of Petitioner's direct appeal. (D.I. 18-2 at 189-190) In September \n2015, Petitioner voluntarily withdrew his appeal. (Id. at 190) The Superior Court denied Petitioner's motion for reduction of sentence on January 11, 2016. (Id. at 187-192) \nPetitioner did not appeal that decision. \nIn December 2016, this time represented by counsel, Petitioner filed a motion for \npostconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 \nmotion\"). The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion in August 2016, and the \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision in May 2017. See Ellerbe, 2016 WL \n4119863, at *4; State v. Ellerbe, 161 A.3d 674 (Table), 2017 WL 1901809, at *4 (May 8, \n2017). Petitioner filed a second Rule 61 motion, which the Superior Court summarily \ndismissed. See State v. Ellerbe, 2017 WL 4271207 (Del. Super. Ct. 26, 2017). \nPetitioner did not appeal that decision. \nThereafter, Petitioner filed in this Court a\u00a7 2254 Petition asserting the following \ntwo ineffective assistance of counsel claims: (1) trial counsel provided ineffective \nassistance by failing to impeach the DEA forensic chemist who analyzed the drugs \nseized in his case with evidence of a pending DEA disciplinary proceeding (\"Claim \nOne\"); and (2) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the \nDEA forensic chemist's use of the hypergeometric sampling method to analyze the \ndrugs in Petitioner's case (\"Claim Two\"). (D.I. 34 at 8) In a Memorandum Opinion \ndated September 25, 2020, the Court denied Claim One as meritless and Claim Two as \nprocedurally barred. (D.I. 34; D.I 35) On October 1, 2020, Petitioner simultaneously \nfiled a Notice of Appeal from that decision (D.I. 36) and a timely motion to alter or \namend the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) (D.I 37). \n2 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nA motion for reconsideration/amend judgment filed pursuant Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 59(e) is \"a device to relitigate the original issue decided by the district court, \nand [it is] used to allege legal error.\" United States v. Fiorelli, 337 F.3d 282, 288 (3d Cir. \n2003). In order to prevail on a Rule 59(e) motion, the moving party must show one of \nthe following: (1) an intervening change in the controlling law; (2) the availability of new \nevidence that was not available when the court issued its order; or (3) the need to \ncorrect a clear error of law or fact or to prevent a manifest injustice. Max's Seafood \nCafe v. Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669,677 (3d Cir. 1999). A motion for reconsideration is not \nappropriate to reargue issues that the court has already considered and decided. \nBrambles USA Inc. v. Blocker, 735 F. Supp. 1239, 1240 (D. Del. 1990). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nThe DEA forensic chemist who tested the drug evidence in Petitioner's case \ndetermined that the net weight of the 262 bags of heroin seized was 3.5 grams. The \n\"chemist explained that, after analyzing 27 of the 262 individual glassine bags and \nfinding that 27 bags contained heroin, she used a hypergeometric sampling method1 to \ndetermine with 95% accuracy that 90% of the remaining 235 bags also contained \nheroin.\" Ellerbe, 2017 WL 1901809, at *1. \n1\"The hypergeometric sampling methodology allows the testing laboratory to test a \nportion of the seized drugs, and, based upon those test results, infer certain conclusions \nabout the balance of the untested seized drugs. It is a statistical model based upon a \nmathematical formula that produces a statistical inference that, if a certain number of \nrandomly selected samples are tested and all test positive, then it is probable that most \nof the remaining items would likewise test positive if actually tested.\" State v. \nRoundtree, 2015 WL 5461668, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 17, 2015) \n3 In Claim Two of his Petition, Petitioner argued that trial counsel provided \nineffective assistance by failing to challenge the DEA forensic chemist's use of the \nhypergeometric sampling method to analyze the drugs in Petitioner's case. The Court \ndenied Claim Two as procedurally barred from habeas review. Petitioner's instant Rule \n59(e) Motion challenges the Court's denial of Claim Two as procedurally barred and, \nmore specifically, its conclusion that the limited exception to procedurally defaulted \nineffective assistance of trial counsel claims established in Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 \n(2012) does not apply in his case. (D.I. 37 at 1) According to Petitioner, the Court \nmisinterpreted the underlying ineffective assistance of trial counsel argument in Claim \nTwo as asserting that trial counsel \"failed to challenge the reliability of the \nhypergeometric sampling.\" (D.I. 37 at 1) Instead, Petitioner contends that he was \n(D.I. 37 at 1) arguing [that his] trial attorney was deficient for not \nchallenging the use of hypergeometric sampling as a matter \nof law. [ ... ] [T]rial counsel [ ... committed] an inexcusable \nmistake of law [by] unreasonabl[y] fail[ing] to understand the \nplain language of Title 16 Del. C. Sec. 4751, which doesn't \npermit hypergeometric sampling on any drugs except \nprescription drugs. \nIn essence, Petitioner asserts that the Court would have determined that Claim \nTwo had some merit warranting the excusal of Petitioner's procedural default under \nMartinez's exception to the procedural default doctrine if the Court had properly \nreviewed Claim Two as alleging that trial counsel failed to challenge the propriety of \nusing the hypergeometric sampling method in his case. (D.I. 37 at 6-7) Petitioner's \n4 Rule 59(e) Motion appears to invoke the \"clear error of law or fact\" and \"manifest \ninjustice\" clause of Rule 59(e). \nThe Court is not entirely convinced that Petitioner's instant contention regarding \ntrial counsel's failure to challenge the propriety of hypergeometric testing on any of the \ndrugs in his case asserts a separate and distinct ineffective assistance allegation from \nthe argument explicitly considered by the Court in its Memorandum Opinion. \nNevertheless, to the extent Petitioner's instant contention does constitute a different \nargument deserving further discussion,2 the argument does not warrant reconsideration \nof the Court's dismissal of Claim Two as procedurally barred, because the argument \ndoes not trigger Martinez's limited exception to the procedural default doctrine. First, \nPetitioner's contention that the hypergeometric sampling procedure was improperly \nused in his case lacks merit. Delaware courts have explicitly approved the \n\"hypergeometric sampling procedure that the Delaware Division of Forensic Science \nwas using for testing large quantities of heroin.\" State v. Mitchell, 2017 WL 3912974, at \n*1 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 7, 2017). Additionally, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that he \nwas prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to challenge the use of the hypergeometric \nsampling method in his case, because there was sufficient other evidence of drug \ndealing for a reasonable jury to convict Petitioner even without scientific confirmation \n2Although Petitioner raised this specific allegation concerning trial counsel's failure to \nchallenge the propriety of using hypergeometric sampling in his Response to the State's \nAnswer, the Court did not explicitly address the instant argument when it considered the \ngeneral ineffective assistance allegation presented in Claim Two. \n5 that the seized substance was heroin.3 Since Petitioner cannot demonstrate prejudice, \nhis instant contention regarding trial counsel's ineffective assistance is meritless and \nfails to satisfy Martinez's standard for excusing a procedural default. \nIn summary, the Petitioner's instant argument fails to present a clear error of law \nor fact or demonstrate a manifest injustice of the sort that would compel reconsideration \nof the Court's denial of Claim Two. Accordingly, the Court will deny Petitioner's Rule \n59( e) motion. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the aforementioned reasons, the Court will deny the instant Rule. 59(e) \nMotion. (D.I. 37) The Court also declines to issue a certificate of appealability, because \nPetitioner has failed to make a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional \n3In order for Petitioner to be guilty of drug dealing under 16 Del. Code\u00a7 4752(2), the \nState had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner: (1) knowingly possessed \nwith the intent to deliver two or more grams of \"morphine, opium, any salt of an isomer \nthereof, or heroin[ ... ] or any mixture containing any such controlled substance\" and (2) \nthat the offense occurred in a vehicle. (D.I. 18-2 at 18) In addition to the forensic \nchemist's testing results and testimony, the record contains the following evidence of \ndrug dealing. Detective Mark Grajewski and Officer Michael Cornbrooks testified that \nthey observed Petitioner engage in a hand-to-hand transaction with the driver of another \nvehicle. (D.I. 17-13 at 73, 80-81) Following the hand-to-hand transaction, Detective \nGrajewski observed Petitioner counting money inside his car as the other vehicle drove \naway. (Id. at 73, 78) Petitioner also made excessive efforts to evade police officers \nafter they attempted to pull him over, including traveling at unreasonable speeds. (Id. at \n80, 84) After Petitioner crashed his car, Special Agent Hughes found a plastic bag on \nPetitioner's lap containing 260 pre-packaged bags of a substance that field tested \npositive for heroin and weighed a total of 3.9 grams. (D.I. 17-3 at 86, 96; D.I. 18-2 at \n16) The police also found drug paraphernalia in the car -five cell phones and \napproximately $11,000 in cash.
