BERKLEY  CORP ., \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nJULIE  ANN  W. DUNAI , \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:19 -cv-01223 -SB \n \nScott A. Holt, YOUNG , CONAWAY , STARGATT & TAYLOR LLP, Wilmington , Delaware ; \nCurtis J. Crowther, ROBINSON & COLE LLP, Wilmington, Delaware.  \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff.  \n \nDaniel C. Herr, LAW OFFICE OF DANIEL C. HERR LLC, Wilmington, Delaware; \nKristen E. Prinz, Amit S. Bindra, THE PRINZ LAW FIRM, P.C.,  Chicago, Illinois . \n \nCounsel for Defendant.  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nSeptember 28, 202 2 \nBIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nJulie Dunai \u2019s employer  gave her  stock  incentives . That  arrangement  aligned their \ninterests : the more profitable she made the company, the wealthier she would be . But \nthere were  strings attached . If Dunai left for a competitor, the company could  take \nthe stock back. She did, so the company exercised its right. Now she claims that the \ncompany acted  in bad faith . It did not , so she must pay the company back.   \n2 I. THE GIVE AND THE TAKE \nDunai , a corporate vice president,  got more than  $200,000 in stock benefits from \nher former employer\u2019s parent company,  W. R. Berkley. D.I. 60 -1 at A3. But those ben-\nefits came with a clawback provision : if Dunai  took \u201cCompetitive Action\u201d against the \ncompany within a year of leaving , the company could demand repayment. Id. at A7\u2013\n10. (Technically, there were four separate provisions, one per contract for each stock \ndistribution. But the relevant terms are the same, so I refer to all the contracts as \none unit. Id. at A7\u201310, 22\u201326, 35\u201339, 49\u201353.) \nThe stock -benefit contract lays out the substance and procedure for determining \nwhether Dunai took  Competitive Action . Substantively , the contract  defines \u201cCom-\npetitive Action\u201d  as \u201cengag [ing]  in \u2026 business activities \u2026 which are competitive with \nany business activities conducted by [ her former  company] in [the company\u2019s] geo-\ngraphical area [of operation] .\u201d Id. at A8. Procedurally , it gives  a Compensation Com-\nmittee  \u201csole and absolute discretion\u201d to decide whether an act meets that definition . \nId. at A9. Despite that language,  the Committee\u2019s discretion is bound ed. A court can \nsecond -guess  the Committee\u2019s  decision  if it was made  through \u201cfraud or bad faith  \nunder Delaware law .\u201d Id. at A14.  \nDunai eventually decided to leave for a high -ranking position at another company \nin the same industry. In her exit interview,  she told HR the name of her new em-\nployer . D.I. 59-1 at 347. Dunai also received  a letter about her continuing duties  to \nher former employer . She was reminded to  \u201creview the [ stock -benefit] agreements to \nfully understand [her] obligations, including an obligation to advise [W.R. Berkley ] of \na new empl oyer and [her] position with such entity.\u201d D.I. 60 -2 at A221.  Those  \n3 agreements  required Dunai to give W. R. Berkley detailed information  about her new \njob. See, e.g. , D.I. 60 -1 at A9 \u201310. But she  failed to do so.  \nAbout a month after Dunai started her new job, W. R. Berkley claim ed that she \nhad taken  a Competitive Action . Id. at 48\u201351. The Committee met, reviewed a two-\nhundred -page packet, and unanimously agreed  with W.  R. Berkley . Id. at A98\u2013114. \nDunai refused to return the stock benefits, so W. R. Berkley  sued . \nAt the motion -to-dismiss stage, Dunai argued that Illinois law applied and  that \nthe contract was unreasonable. D.I. 27 at 2\u20136. I rejected both arguments, instea d \nfinding the  contract reason able under Delaware law.  D.I. 32 at 3 \u20137. \nNow, at summary judgment, Dunai contends that (1)  because of a new Illinois \nstatute, I should apply Illinois law; (2)  the Committee  acted in bad faith ; and ( 3) the \nCommittee breached the implied covenant of good fai th and fair dealing. D.I. 61 at 3. \nAll these arguments fail.  Because there is no \u201cgenuine dispute as to any material fact\u201d  \nand W.  R. Berkley \u201cis entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\u201d  I grant its summary -\njudgment motion and deny Dunai\u2019s . Fed. R. Civ. P.  56(c).  \nII. DELAWARE LAW STILL APPLIES  \nI decided  that Delaware law applies  to this dispute . D.I.  32 at 3 \u20135. Dunai now \nclaims that  a recent amendment to an  Illinois statute changes the choice -of-law cal-\nculation. But that amendment governs only agreements \u201centered into after [its] ef-\nfective date ,\u201d January 1, 2022 . 820 ILCS 90/5 (West 2022). Dunai entered into the \nstock -benefit contract long before  that. D.I. 60 -1 at A6, 21, 33, 47. So the amendment \ndoes not apply . Plus , the amendment has not changed Illinois\u2019s fundamental policy  \n4 on noncompete agreements. It remains  a reasonableness test. 820 ILCS  90/7 (West \n2022).  So the choice -of-law ruling stands . \nIII. THE COMMITTEE ACTED IN GOOD  FAITH  \nThe contract let the  Committee decide whether Dunai engaged in a Competitive \nAction. D.I. 60 -1 at A8.  But a court may review that decision for fraud or bad faith . \nId. at A14. Dunai  challenges  the Committee\u2019s decision by invoking  that fraud -or-bad-\nfaith provision  plus the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing . Under Dela-\nware law , and as Dunai styles them , these are affirmative defenses : Dunai would \nbear the burden of pro ving them at trial . D.I. 35 at 11 \u201315; see KE Prop. Mgmt. Inc. v. \n275 Madison Mgmt. Corp. , 1993 WL 285900, at *7 \u201310 (Del. Ch. July 27, 1993)  (fraud \nand bad faith) ; Daystar Const. Mgmt., Inc. v. Mitchell , 2006 WL 2053649, at *6 \u20137 \n(Del. Super. Ct. July 12, 2006) (implied covenant) . \nSo to survive summary judgment , Dunai must make a \u201cshowing suffici ent to es-\ntablish the existence of an element essential to [her] case .\u201d Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , \n477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). Here, rather than forcing W.  R. Berkley to prove that it did \nnot do something, Dunai \u2019s showing of fraud or bad faith  must at least be better than \n\u201ca complete failure of proof .\u201d Id. at 323.  \nThough n either party defines  fraud or bad faith , Delaware law does . And t he con-\ntract  incorporate s that body of law  when it references  \u201cfraud or bad faith  under Del-\naware law .\u201d D.I. 60 -1 at A14 (emphasis added ). To prove fraud or bad faith, Delaware \nlaw require s scienter. Dunai says nothing about the Committee\u2019s state of mind.  So \nshe has failed to make an adequate showing .  \n5 A. Dunai fails to show  bad faith  \nDunai never alleges fraud, but she does claim bad faith. Showing  bad faith  is hard . \nThe Committee  might have been  \u201cineffective, its actions obtuse, its results harmful \n\u2026 without implicating bad faith.\u201d Okla. Firefighters Pension & Ret. Sys. v. Corbat , \n2017 WL 6452240, at *17  (Del. Ch. Dec. 18, 2017) . To have acted in bad faith , the  \nCommittee  must have (1)  been motivated \u201cby an actual intent to do harm\u201d or (2)  com-\nmitted  an \u201cintentional dereliction of duty, a conscious disregard for [its] responsibili-\nties.\u201d McElrath v. Kalanick , 224 A.3d 982, 991 \u201392 (Del. 2020)  (internal quotation \nmarks omit ted). Something  \u201cmore \u2026 than  gross negligence  is required .\u201d In re Walt \nDisney Co. Derivative Litig. , 906 A.2d 27, 66 (Del. 2006).  \nBut all Dunai alleges is  a series of shortcomings in the Committee\u2019s deliberations . \nShe says  it (1) \u201crubber stamped\u201d the clawback , (2) \u201creviewed incomplete and inaccu-\nrate information ,\u201d (3) decided in a \u201ccategorically unclear\u201d manner, (4)  did not contact  \nher, (5)  \u201cshould have real ized\u201d that her new job \u201ceasily could have been non-\ncompetitive ,\u201d and (6)  reviewed blank pages in its packet . D.I. 59 at 12 \u201313. Plus, the \nCommittee Chair said  she could not remember  a time that, in her fifteen years on the \nCommittee,  it failed to find  a Com petitive Action. Id. at 6\u20137. \nEven if true , these allegations fail to show  a genuine dispute over  bad faith . The \ninformation might have been incomplete, but the Committee still  review ed hundreds \nof pages of information about the two companies, noted Dunai\u2019s title at  her new com-\npany , and unanimously found  that her new job competed with her old company . D.I. \n60-1 at A98 \u2013114; D.I. 60-2 at A217 \u2013503. And though  Dunai highlights diffe rences in \nthe companies\u2019 relative size, revenue, and geographic reach, those differences do not  \n6 imply the absence of competition. Indeed, even Dunai admit s that there is \u201cminor\u201d \noverlap. Dunai Dep. Tr. , D.I. 59 -1 at 364\u201368. Perhaps the Committee could have \u2014or \neven should have \u2014decided  that Dunai\u2019s new job was noncompetitive. But negligen ce \nor unreasonabl eness  falls far short of  bad faith.  \nAs noted, Dunai never invokes the fraud half of the fraud -or-bad-faith provision. \nBut for the same reasons,  her allegations do not show fraud. Fraud under Delaware \nlaw also requires scienter. Metro Commc\u2019n Corp. BVI v. Adv. Mobilecomm Techs. Inc. , \n854 A.2d 121, 143 \u201344 (Del. Ch. 2004).  \nDunai comes closest to bad faith  in claiming  that the C ommittee rubber  stamp ed \nthe clawback , reviewed blank  pages, and  has never failed to find a Competitive Ac-\ntion. But the rubber -stamping claim is just a tagline assertion ; the other two are po-\ntential evidence of it.  \nAs for the blank pages,  Dunai might be on  to something if the Committee really \ndid review a packet full of white space . Yet nearly all the packet was filled with in-\nformation . D.I. 60 -2 at A217 \u2013503. Dunai focuses on  the blank space on her LinkedIn \npage, but the Committee could still gather  her new title from it . Id. at A226.  \nFinally, even if the Committee has never failed to find a Competitive Action, that \ndoes not create a genuine dispute over bad faith. It is, at b est, a sliver of circumstan-\ntial evidence about scienter . And it says nothing about  whether  the Committee ful-\nfilled its duties in Dunai\u2019s case. Without more, this one historical fact does not create \na genuine dispute over the Committee\u2019s state of mind .  \n7 B. The contract\u2019s express terms trump  the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing  \nAs a catchall , Dunai argues that the Committee  breached the implied covenant of \ngood faith and fair dealing.  This is another steep hill. Nemec v. Shrader , 991 A.2d \n1120, 1128 ( Del. 2010)  (describing the covenant as an \u201cextraordinary legal remedy\u201d).  \nAlthough the covenant \u201cinheres in all contracts,\u201d it applies in just two situations . \nTrumbull Radiologists, Inc. v. Premier Imaging Tri Holdings LLC , 2021 WL 5577249, \nat *4 (Del. Super. Ct. Nov. 29, 2021) ; see Oxbow Carbon & Mins. Holdings, Inc. v. \nCrestview -Oxbow Acquisition, LLC , 202 A.3d 482, 504 n.93 (Del. 2019) . First, it  can \n\u201cfill unanticipated contractual gaps.\u201d  Trumbull , 2021 WL 5577249, at *4.  Second, it \nkicks in \u201cwhen a party to the contract is given discretion \u2026 and it is argued that the \ndiscretion has been used in a way that is impliedly proscribed by the contract\u2019s ex-\npress terms. \u201d Oxbow Carbon, 202 A.3d at 504  n.93;  see also Blish v. Thompson \nAutomatic  Arms Corp ., 64 A.2d 581, 597 (Del. 1948) (\u201cThe term \u2018absolute judgment,\u2019 \nas indicated, means a judgment based upon sincerity, honesty, fair dealing and good \nfaith, not one evidencing caprice or bad faith.\u201d).  \nBut the covenant \u201ccannot be used to circumvent the partie s\u2019 bargain, or to create \na free -floating duty.\u201d Trumbull , 2021 WL 5577249, at *4  (internal quotation marks \nomitted) . Here, express terms control . The contract  specifie s the definition  that the \nCommittee  will apply, the procedure that it will follow, and the limits on its discre-\ntion. And those limits  already let a court review the Committee\u2019s exercise of discretion \nfor fraud or bad faith. So there is no discretion for the covenant to cabin  or gap for it \nto fill.   \n8 * * * * * \nDunai argues  that her new work  does not compete with her old company \u2019s. But \nshe agreed to leave that decision to the Compensation Committee unless it intention-\nally did something wrong . Because Dunai fails to allege that kind of wrongful intent , \nshe is bound by the Committee\u2019s decision . So I grant summary judgment for W.  R. \nBerkley.   \n \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT   \nFOR TH E DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nW. R. BERKLEY  CORP. , \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nJULIE  ANN  W.
