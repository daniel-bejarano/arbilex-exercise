No. 19-2243-LPS \nCLAIRE DEMATTEIS , et al., \nDefendants. \nSteven Paul Dula, Georgetown, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nJune 13, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION f.t-1 P-~ \nSTARK, U.S. Circuit Judge: \nI. INTROD UCTION \nPlaintiff Steven Paul Dula (''Plaintiff' ') was an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional \nCenter (''J1VCC'') in Smyrna, Delaware, at the time he filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983.1 (D .I. 1) Plaintiff appears pro se and has paid the filing fee.2 The Court dismissed the \noriginal complaint and gave Plaintiff leave to amend. (D.I. 12, 13) He filed an Amended Complaint \non December 4, 2020. (D.I. 17) The Court proceeds to review and screen the Amended Complaint \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). \nII. BACKGRO UND \nAs an initial matter, the Court reviews only the Amended Complaint filed on December 4, \n2020. \"It is the complaint which defines the nature of an action, and once accepted, an amended \ncomplaint replaces the original.\" Bamat v. Glenn 0. Hawbaker, Inc., 2019 WL 1125817, at *1 n.4 \n(M.D. Pa. Mar. 12, 2019) (quoting Florida Dep't of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. 670, 706 n.2 \n(1982); see also Snyder v. Pascack Valley Hosp., 303 F.3d 271,276 (3d Cir. 2002) (\"An amended \ncomplaint supersedes the original version in providing the blueprint for the future course of a \nlawsuit.''). \nPlaintiff alleges that from 2009 thru 2011, he was held at Sussex Correctional Center, asked \nthe C/O's for a job on the food court, and never received one. (D.I. 17 at 2) When he was \n1 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a \nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See \nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n2 Section 1915A(b) (1) is applicable to all prisoner lawsuits regardless of whether the litigant paid the \nfee all at once or in installments . See Stringer v. Bureau of Prisons, Federa/Agenry, 145 F. App'x 751, 752 \n(3d Cir. 2005). \n1 transferred to JTVCC he asked the C/O's to put him on the job list so he could earn good time but \nwas never put on the list due to his disability (i.e., 5 lb. limitation ). (Id.) Plaintiff told several C/O's \nabout his limitation. (Id.) When Plaintiff was moved to Housing Unit E Building, Plaintiff asked \nSgt. Beckles to place him on the job list so that he could earn good time for working. (Id. at 3) \nPlaintiff alleges he was never given a job due to his disability and passing out. (Id.) When Plaintiff \nwas transferred to W-Building, he again asked Sgt. Beckles to place him on the job list so he could \nearn good time for working, and Beckles told Plaintiff to stop asking. (Id.) Plaintiff complains that \nthere are no jobs for him within the Department of Correction with a 5 pound weight limitation. \n(Id.) He seeks 600 good time credits and compensatory damages. (Id. at 2) \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief \nmay be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. \nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a \ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a prose plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of \nAlleghe1!J, 515 F.3d 224,229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Amended Complaint, \"however \ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by \nlawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Doolry v. Wetzel, \n957 F.3d. 366,374 (3d Cir. 2020); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. \n2002). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends 'on an \"indisputabl y meritless legal \n2 theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or delusional\" factual scenario.\"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 \nF.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See \nTourscherv. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard \nto dismissal for failure to state claim under\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before dismissing a \ncomplaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to the \nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to amend his \nComplaint, unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Gr(!JSOn, 293 F.3d at 114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bel/At/. Corp. v. Twomb!J, 550 \nU.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations \" are not required, a complaint must do \nmore than simply provide \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.\" Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Cata!Jsts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, \n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twomb!J, 550 U.S. at 570). \nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See \nJohnson v. Ciry of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect \nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nUnder the pleading regime established by Twomb!J and Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency \nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a \n3 claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-plead ed factual allegations, the court should assume \ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See \nConnel!J v. Lane Const Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task \nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id \nIV. DISCUSSION \nThe claims raised in the Amended Complaint fail for the same reason as did the claims \nraised in the original complaint. It is far from clear that Plaintiff has named the proper defendants. \nIn addition, the Amended Complaint does not allege conduct by any named Defendant that led to \nthe denial of a work assignment. While Plaintiff submitted documents that indicate he sought \neducation opportunities, there are no allegations based upon a denial of education. Finally, an \ninmate has no entitlement to a specific job, or even to any job. See James v. Quinlan, 866 F.2d 627, \n630 (3d Cir. 1989); see also Flaf!Yak v. Ross, 153 F. App'x 810, 812 (3d Cir. 2005). \nAccordingly, the Amended Complaint will be dismissed as legally frivolous pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1 ). The Court finds amendment futile. Plaintiff was given an opportunity to \ncorrect his pleading deficiencies but he failed to do so. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). \nV. CONCL USION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint as legally frivolous pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). Amendment is futile. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSTEVEN PAUL DULA, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civ. No. 19-2243-LPS \nCLAIRE DEMATTEIS, et al., \nDefendants . \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 13th day of June, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion \nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED as legally frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915A(b)(1). Amendment is futile. \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case. "}
