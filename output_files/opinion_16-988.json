{"case_name": "Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. v. CIPLA Limited et al", "case_number": "16-988", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "02-17-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nONYX THERAPEUTICS , Inc., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCIPLA Ltd. & CIPLA USA Inc., \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 16-988-GBW \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiffs Onyx Therapeutics , Inc. (\"Onyx\") sued Defendants Cipla Ltd . and Cipla USA, \nInc. (collectively, \"Cipla\") for infringement of multiple patents. D.I. 1 ,r 7. Fifteen additional \nDefendants were at various points part of the case, but three Defendants settled with Onyx in \nFebruary 2018, see C.A. No. 15-988, Order of Feb. 7, 2018; Order of Feb. 14, 2018, and the Court \nentered consent judgments as to 12 additional defendants in May 2019, D.I. 504; D.I. 505; D.I. \n506; D.I. 507; D.I. 508; D.I. 509; D.I. 513; D.I. 514. A bench trial was held on May 6-16, 2019, \nD.I. 523; D.I. 529, and the Court found valid and infringed four claims across three patents-in-suit , \nD.I. 549. The Federal Circuit upheld the judgment. D.I. 553. Onyx moved for taxation of costs \nfrom the Clerk of Court (the \"Clerk\"), D.I. 557, and the Clerk granted-in-part and denied-in-part \nOnyx's motion, D.I. 564. Pending now before the Court is Onyx's Motion for Review of Taxation \nof Costs (the \"Motion,\" D.I. 565). The Court has reviewed the parties' briefing, D.I. 566; D.I. \n578; D.I. 581, and no hearing is necessary . For the reasons below, the Court grants-in-part and \ndenies-in-part the Motion and taxes Cipla $48,146.36 in costs in favor of Onyx. \nI. BACKGROUND \nTrial began on May 6, 2019. Defendants Fresenius Kabi USA LLC and Fresenius Kabi \nUSA Inc. (\"Fresenius\"), InnoPharma Inc. (\"InnoPharma\"), Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. \n1 (\"Apotex\") , Sagent Pharmaceuticals , Inc. (\"Sagent\"), and Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc. \n(\"Aurobindo\") reached proposed consent judgments on the eve of trial, D.I. 504; D.I. 505; D.I. \n506; D.I. 507 D.I. 508, while Qilu Pharma, Inc. and Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\"Quilu\") and \nTeva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (\"Teva\") had settled in February 2018, D.I. 114; D.I. 132. Thus, \ntrial proceeded only against Defendants Cipla, Breckenridge Pharmaceutical Inc. \n(\"Breckenridge \"), MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc. and MSN Laboratories Private Ltd. (\"MSN\"), and \nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. (\"Dr. Reddy's\"). D.I. 523 at \n6:19-7:7. Proposed consentjudgments were submitted as to MSN on May 7, 2019, D.I. 503, as to \nDr. Reddy's on May 9, 2019, D.I. 510, and as to Breckenridge on May 10, 2019, D.I. 511. Thus, \nthe Court only entered final judgment as to Cipla on May 13, 2020, following post-trial briefing. \nD.I. 549. \nAfter appeal of this case concluded on April 30, 2021, D.I. 554, Onyx filed its Bill of Costs \nwith the Clerk on May 14, 2021, D.I. 557. Cipla filed objections two weeks later. D.I. 561. Onyx \nsought the following costs: (A) $775 in clerk fees; (B) $9,300.43 for pretrial and trial transcripts ; \n(C) $44,282.03 for deposition transcript costs; (D) $13,793.81 for witness traveling costs, lodging, \nand fees; (E) copying and exemplification costs, including $242,051.44 in document production \ncosts, $45,236.16 in document copying costs for trial, and $308,193.98 in demonstrative and \npresentation costs for trial; and (F) $11,346.75 in costs for \"certified file wrappers of the patents \nin suit[.]\" D.I. 557 at passim. Cipla took issue with certain cost categories and with assessment \nof all charges against only one Defendant , Cipla. See D.I. 561. The clerk granted-in-part Onyx's \nfee request. D.I. 564. The clerk granted $775 for \"Fees of the Clerk,\" $6,765.63 for \"Fees for \nWitnesses,\" and $945.00 for fees for obtaining copies of the patent file wrappers. D.I. 564 at 11. \nThe Clerk denied all other costs. Id. Onyx then brought the present Motion. D.I. 565. \n2 II. LEGAL STANDARD \nUnder Delaware Local Rule 54.1, \"the prevailing party shall be entitled to costs.\" D. Del. \nLR 54.l(a)(l) ; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(l). \"Costs [are] taxed in conformity with the provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1920, 1921, and 1923,\" among others, \"and the remaining paragraphs ... of this \nRule.\" D. Del. LR 54. l(b)(l). The Local Rule provides for taxation of transcript fees, deposition \ncosts, witness fees, mileage, and subsistence , and costs of copying papers, among others. Id \n54.l(b). Statute similarly provides that \n[a] judge or clerk ... may tax as costs ... (1) [flees of the clerk and marshal; (2) \n[flees for printed or electronicall y recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use \nin the case; (3) [flees and disbursements for printing and witnesses ; ( 4) [flees for \nexemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies \nare necessarily obtained for use in the case; (5) Docket fees ... ; [and] (6) \nCompensation of court appointed experts[] ... [and] interpreters .... \" \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. \nCosts are limited \"to those enumerated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920.\" Reger v. The Nemours \nFound, Inc., 599 F.3d 285, 288 (3d Cir. 2010). The Supreme Court \"has accorded a narrow \nreading of'\u00a7 1920. Race Tires Am., Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 674 F.3d 158, 171 (3d Cir. \n2012); see Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd, 566 U.S. 560, 573 (2012) (describing the \"narrow \nscope of taxable costs). Thus, fees are available for making copies, but \"only scanning and file \nformat conversion can be considered to be making copies.\" Camesi v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med \nCtr., 753 F. App'x 135, 139 (3d Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nThe Third Circuit has explained that \n[a] district court's review of the clerk's determination of costs is de nova. However , \nthere is a \"strong presumption \" that costs are to be awarded to the prevailing party. \n\"Only if the losing party can introduce evidence, and the district court can articulate \nreasons within the bounds of its equitable power, should costs be reduced .... \" \nThus, if a district court , within its discretion , denies or reduces a prevailing party's \naward of costs, it must articulate its reasons for doing so. \n3 Reger, 599 F.3d at 288 (citations and footnote omitted); see Carroll v. Clifford Twp., 625 F. App'x \n43, 47 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting Reger, 599 F.3d at 288). The Third Circuit has also explained that, \nwhile a district Court may consider \"the prevailing party's unclean hands, bad faith, dilatory \ntactics, or failures to comply with process\" and \"the losing parties' ... inability to pay(,]\" the Court \nmay not consider the merits of the decision to pursue litigation, the \"closeness of the issues[,]\" or \ndisparities in wealth between the parties. Reger, 599 F.3d at 288 n.3 (citations omitted). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nThe parties do not dispute that Onyx prevailed in this case. D.I. 566 at 3; D.I. 578 at 2. \nOnyx seeks $657,549.67 in costs, D.I. 566 at 1, while Cipla asks the Court to \"affirm the Clerk's \nTaxation of Costs[,]\" or $8,485.63, D.I. 578 at 1-2 & n.1. The parties dispute both which costs \nare allowable and whether the Court should apportion those costs and, thus, charge Cipla only a \nfraction of the allowable costs that Onyx incurred. For the reasons below, the Court taxes \n$48,146.36 in favor of Onyx and against Cipla. \na. Allowable Costs \nThe parties do not contest that the costs the Clerk taxed against Cipla are allowable. Those \ncosts included $775 for Clerk fees; $6,765.63 for witness travel and lodging; and $945.00 for \nproducing the patents and file wrappers. D.I. 566 at 2 n.1; D.I. 578 at 1 n.1, 20. Thus, the Court \nconsiders whether the other categories of costs that Onyx requests are allowable taxable costs. \nFirst, Onyx requests $9,300.43 for \"the transcripts of pre-trial proceedings and the bench \ntrial .... \" D.I. 566 at 6. The Clerk found \"that [Onyx] fails to meet the requirements of LR \n54.1 (b )(2)\" and denied the request. D.I. 564 at 3. Onyx argues that \"costs for transcripts need not \ndepend on whether the Court explicitly requested transcripts \" and that transcripts are \"implicit[ly ]\" \nnecessary for both the parties and the Court. D.I. 566 at 6. Cipla argues that, under LR 54.1 (b )(2), \n4 transcript copies for counsel's use are not taxable, and Onyx \"obtained two 'additional copies' of \nboth the trial and pretrial transcripts for its own use, for an additional $2,800.20. \" D.I. 578 at 8. \nSection 1920(2) permits a prevailing party to seek \"[f]ees for printed or electronically recorded \ntranscripts necessarily obtained for use in the case[.]\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(2). While LR 54.l(b)(2) \nprovides that \"[ c ]opies of transcripts for counsel's own use are not taxable[,]\" Judge Stark, who \npresided over this case, has found such costs taxable under \u00a7 1920(2). Judge Stark explained that \n\"the undersigned Judge regularly resolves discovery disputes during teleconferences , articulating \nthe Court's reasoning on the transcript and often without issuing any formal, written order. In \norder to effectively litigate a patent case in light of this procedure , it is likely necessary to have a \ncopy of such a transcript.\" Cloud Farm Assocs., L.P v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am., Inc., 2018 WL \n4603264, at *4 (D. Del. Sept. 25, 2018). In this case, Judge Stark issued at least one ruling \"[f]or \nthe reasons stated during the pretrial conference [on April 30, 2019].\" D.I. 491. Since the pretrial \ntranscript was reasonably necessary to effectively litigate this case, and since a trial transcript was \nreasonably necessary for appeal, the Court finds allowable these $9,300.43 in transcript costs. \nSecond, Onyx requests $44,282.03 for deposition transcripts . D.I. 566 at 7-8. The Clerk \ndenied that amount because \"'Onyx made no effort to link the use of any of the 23 deposition \ntranscripts, much less a substantial portion[] of any transcript, to the resolution of any material \nissue in this case.\"' D.I. 564 at 3 ( citation omitted). Onyx asks that the Court exercise its discretion \nto tax deposition costs because such costs were necessary to resolve discovery disputes and to \nexamine witnesses at trial, among other tasks. D.I. 566 at 9. Cipla argues that \"Onyx fails to show \nhow any transcript (much less a substantial portion of such transcript) was used in the resolution \nof a material issue in this case .... \" D .I. 578 at 9. LR 54 .1 (b )(3) provides that deposition costs \n\"are taxable only where a substantial portion of the deposition is used in the resolution of a material \n5 issue in the case.\" Judge Stark has explained that\"' [t]he Local Rule, however, does not embody \nthe full extent of the Court's discretion to award costs associated with depositions to a prevailing \nparty.' 'The outer bounds of that discretion are established , instead, by statute: \u00a7 1920.\"' Cloud \nFarm Assocs., 2018 WL 4603264, at *3 (citations omitted). The statute only requires that \ntranscripts be \"necessarily obtained for use in the case[.]\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(2). Here, the Court \nagrees with Onyx that these deposition transcripts were necessarily obtained for use in the case. \nEven if a deposed witness never testified, the parties use such discovery to understand factual \nissues and build their contentions. Thus, the Court finds Onyx's deposition costs allowable. \nThird, Onyx seeks $242,051.44 in \"costs relating to copying, scanning , imaging and file \nformat conversion , bates-stamping , and document production to Cipla of electronically stored \ninformation and hard-copy documents. \" D.I. 566 at 9. LR 54.l(b)(5) provides that \"[t]he cost of \ncopies of an exhibit necessarily attached to a document required to be filed and served is taxable.\" \nSection 1920( 4) permits taxation of \"costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are \nnecessarily obtained for use in the case[.]\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(4). However, \"only scanning and \nfile format conversion can be considered to be making copies.\" Camesi, 753 F. App'x at 139 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Cipla argues that Onyx should not be able to \nrecover (1) $24,475.95 for February through May of 2017, which is before Cipla and the other \nDefendants filed their first document production request, D.I. 578 at 12; (2) $171,970.59 for certain \nnon-taxable processes to prepare documents for production (i.e., \"Process & Promote to Review \nDatabase[,] Load Files-Native , Scanned & 3rd Party[,] Prepare Data, Text, Images[,] Prepare \nNative Files[,] [and] Equivio Threading & Near-Dup Detection \"), D.I. 578 at 14 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); and (3) 50% of the remaining allowable production costs, because Onyx failed to \ndistinguish between documents it produced and those it prepared but did not produce, D.I. 578 at \n6 16. Onyx responds that (1) it knew before the first request \"that it would be required-by Court \norder-to produce\" certain documents , D.I. 566 at 11; (2) the steps Cipla cites were required to \nprepare documents for production consistent with Court rules, D.I. 581 at 8; and (3) Onyx should \nbe able to recover for the cost of non-produced documents because its \"fees were incurred to \nconvert Onyx's documents into the agreed-upon format ... so that they could be produced to Cipla \nif Onyx's review determined that the documents were responsive.\" D.I. 566 at 11-12. \nThe Court agrees with Onyx as to (1) and (2), since Onyx had and properly anticipated \nproduction obligations prior to Cipla's first document requests and because Onyx provides a \nfulsome explanation of why the steps it took were required for production. Judge Andrews has \npreviously explained that \"[the non-prevailing party] should only be responsible for the documents \nthat Plaintiffs produced to it\" because it \"should only be responsible for the cost of documents that \nwere responsive to discovery requests.\" Sanofi v. Glenmark Pharms., Inc. USA, 2018 WL \n6427870, at *3 (D. Del. Dec. 7, 2018). The Court agrees with Judge Andrews. Here, however, \nCipla alleged that it did not receive some of these documents , but it did not specify the proportion \nof documents it requested. See D.I. 578 at 14 (rejecting costs for \"documents that Onyx ... did \nnot produce ( e.g., non-responsive or privileged documents) \"). Further, Cipla attributes part of its \nproposed 50% reduction to Onyx's failure to \"track[] or disclose[] the identity of each photocopied \npage or describe[] its relevance to the case.\" D.I. 578 at 16. The Court finds that, based on its \nexperience with litigation , it would be near-impossible to carefully track three million pages of \nproduced documents . See D.I. 566 at 11. Since neither party provides any sense of what \nproportion of documents were loaded to Onyx's database but were not responsive to Cipla's \nrequests, the Court applies a rough 10% reduction to account for non-produced documents that \nCipla did not request. Thus, the Court finds that $217,846.30 in costs are allowable for production. \n7 Fourth, Onyx requests $45,236.16 in \"costs for exemplification , printing, and copying \ndocuments reasonably necessary for use at trial .... \" D.I. 566 at 12. The Clerk found that Onyx \nfailed to '\"differentiate between those exemplifications that were admitted into evidence ... and \nthose that were not\"' under LR 54.l(b)(5). D.I. 564 at 9-10. Onyx argues that the Court should \nexercise its discretion to grant additional costs allowable under \u00a7 1920 and that \"Onyx is only \nrequesting to recover the costs of copies of exhibits and demonstratives that were printed during \ntrial ... for use with witnesses (or during opening and closings) .... \" D.I. 566 at 13. Documents \nnot admitted into evidence, Onyx argues, were still potentially necessary \"for cross-examination \nor impeachment. \" Id. Cipla argues that \"Onyx has made no effort to track and explain the \nrelevance of any particular page \" and that Onyx should not recover for making numerous copies \nor for documents never admitted into evidence. The Court agrees with Onyx, since documents \nbeyond those admitted into evidence are \"necessarily obtained for use in the case\" and important \nto the operation of trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920( 4). For example , parties must provide witness \nexamination binders to the Court, the Court's staff, the witness, and opposing counsel. See, e.g., \nD.I. 523 at 73:11-21 (discussing handing out examination binders). Thus, the Court finds that the \nentire $45,236.16 in copying costs for trial are allowable . \nFifth, Onyx requests $308,193.98 in \"costs for preparing its demonstrative exhibits for use \nat trial.\" D.I. 566 at 14. The Clerk found that Onyx did not clearly describe how or why the \nrequested costs were taxable and so denied them. D.I. 264 at 10-11. Onyx argues that it \n\"'necessarily obtained\"' the demonstratives for use in the case \"to aid the Court's understanding \nof[] difficult scientific concepts. \" D.I. 566 at 14 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(4)). Cipla argues that \nLR 54.1 (b) and \u00a7 1920 do not \"provide for taxation of costs relating to demonstrative exhibits and \ntrial presentation/equipment , and Onyx fails to cite to any binding court decision allowing such \n8 costs.\" D.I. 578 at 18. Cipla also argues that \"the costs for trial graphics consulting requested by \nOnyx do not relate to any presentation required by the trial judge\" and are based on invoices that \nlack detail. Id. Onyx replies, first, with a citation to Judge Stark's opinion in Intellectual Ventures \nI LLC v. Symantec Corp., 2019 WL 1332356, at *4 (D. Del. Mar. 25, 2019), and, second, with the \nargument that Onyx does not seek recovery for intellectual effort because \"[t]rial graphics \nconsultants are artists, not attorneys .... \" D.I. 581 at 9-10. \nThe Supreme Court has distinguished between taxable costs and \"nontaxable expenses \nborne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consultants, and investigators.\" Taniguchi, 566 U.S. at \n573. Costs are limited \"to those enumerated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920[,]\" Reger, 599 F.3d at 288, and \nthe Supreme Court \"has accorded a narrow reading of'\u00a7 1920, Race Tires Am., 674 F.3d at 171. \nSection 1920 permits recovery of\"[f]ees for exemplification,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(4), and Black's \nLaw Dictionary defines \"exemplification\" as \"[a]n official transcript of a public record, \nauthenticated as a true copy for use as evidence[,]\" Exemplification, Black's Law Dictionary (11th \ned. 2019). The Third Circuit has declined to \"decide whether Congress used the term \n'exemplification' in its narrow 'legal sense,' or in the broader sense\" that would include exhibits \nand demonstrative aids. Race Tires Am., 674 F.3d at 166. Here, the Court agrees with Onyx that \nexemplification would not include the intellectual effort of consultants to prepare graphics for trial. \nIn Intellectual Ventures I, Judge Stark allowed costs to produce color demonstratives to the other \nside, not to design the demonstratives. See 2019 WL 1332356, at *4 (\"[I]t would be especially \nunfair not to allow recovery for the trial demonstratives when they had to be produced to [the \nopposing party] in color .... \" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Since the parties \nsuggest that only $2,708 of the demonstratives may have been related to production, rather than to \ndesign, see D.I. 578 at 19, the Court finds that only those $2,708 are allowable costs. \n9 Thus, the Court finds allowable the following costs: $775 for Clerk fees; $6,765.63 for \nwitness travel and lodging; $945.00 for producing the patents and file wrappers; $9,300.43 for \ncopies of the pretrial and trial transcripts ; $44,282.03 for deposition transcripts; $217,846.30 for \nproduction of documents in discovery; $45,236.16 in copying costs for trial; and $2,708 m \ndemonstrative production costs. The total allowable costs are $327,858.55. \nb. Apportionment \nThe Court next considers whether to award Onyx only a :fraction of the allowable costs \nfrom Cipla, since Cipla was one of many Defendants.1 Cipla argues that it should only be \nresponsible for one quarter of fees related to trial and one ninth of any discovery and pretrial \nproceedings to account for the other Defendants . See D.I. 278 at 2-4. As Cipla notes, Onyx agreed \nin its consent judgments to dismissal of all claims \"without costs, disbursements or attorneys' fees \nto any party.\" See, e.g., D.I. 506 ,r 6. Thus, Cipla argues, awarding Onyx all allowable costs would \npermit Onyx double recovery. D.I. 278 at 4. Onyx responds that Cipla failed to meet its \"burden \nto show that the award would be inequitable \" because Cipla failed to identify why either trial or \ndiscovery would have been less expensive for Onyx had Cipla been the only Defendant. D.I. 581 \nat 3. Instead, Onyx argues that \"this is the risk Cipla took when it continued to litigate through \ntrial and appeal after the other defendants were dismissed .\" D.I. 581 at 3-4. \nThe Court agrees with Cipla. In a case with two defendants where one defendant and \nplaintiffs stipulated that \"'each [would] bear their own costs[,]\"' Judge Andrews held that \"this \nlanguage indicates that [the remaining defendant] should not be responsible for the half of the costs \n1 Cipla also argues that Onyx's costs should be further reduced because Onyx did not prevail on \nall of the claims it asserted. D.I. 578 at 7. However, Onyx initially accused Cipla's \"proposed \ngeneric product that is the subject of Abbreviated New Drug Application ('ANDA') No. 209479\" \nof infringement , D.I. 1 ,r 4, and the Court's fmaljudgment enjoined Onyx from selling that product \nuntil the patents at issue expire, D.I. 549 ,r 5. Thus, the Court rejects Cipla's argument. that the Court would have assessed against [the other defendant].\" Sanofi v. Glenmark Pharms., \nInc. USA, 2018 WL 6427870, at *1 (D. Del. Dec. 7, 2018). However, the settling defendant in \nthat case settled only after plaintiffs had filed their bill of costs. See id While Sanofi is not entirely \non point here, the Court finds Judge Andrews's reasoning persuasive. Onyx repeatedly agreed \nwith Defendants that Onyx would bear its own costs. See, e.g., D.I. 11417; D.I.50416 ; D.I. 505 \n16; D.I.51416. It would be inequitable for Cipla, here, to bear the costs that those Defendants \nwould have shared, except that Onyx agreed not to seek them. Also, charging Cipla costs for all \nDefendants would discourage consolidation of trials, where the parties benefit from splitting costs. \nThe Court next turns to how to properly divide the costs. Cipla agrees to pay $575.00 in \nclerk costs based on its costs \"before the cases were consolidated(,]\" and the Court accepts that \namount. D.I. 578 at 20 n.13. The Court considers witness fees ($6,765.63), copying costs for trial \n($45,236.16), demonstrati ve costs for trial ($2,708), and trial and pretrial transcripts ($9,300.43) \nas trial costs. Since four defendants proceeded to trial, the Court charges Cipla 25% of those costs. \nThe Court considers the remaining costs-production of the patents and file wrappers ($945.00) , \ndeposition transcripts ($44,282.03), and document production ($217,846.30)--as pre-trial \nlitigation costs. Since nine Defendants remained involved in the case until the eve of trial, the \n100% Court awards 12% of those costs (i.e., f d , rounded upward to the nearest whole 9 De en ants \npercentage ). Thus, the Court taxes Cipla a total of $48,146.36 in costs in favor of Onyx. \nFinally, Onyx and Cipla do not raise the issue of interest. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a) \nprovides that \"[i]nterest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a \ndistrict court.\" Thus, the Court awards Onyx interest as well. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons above, the Court taxes Cipla a total of $48,146.36 in costs in favor of Onyx. \n11 Therefore, at Wihnington this \\~day ofFebruary 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \nthat Onyx's Motion for Review of Taxation of Costs (D.I. 565) is GRANTED-IN-PART and \nDENIED-IN-PART and that the total costs hereby taxed in favor of Onyx and against Cipla, \ntogether with interest at the applicable post-judgment rate specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, are as \nfollows: \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8.
