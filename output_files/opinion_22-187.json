Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware .   \nPro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n           \n \n     \n May 5, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Brandon Lee Panchigar, a pretrial detainee at James To Vaughn \nCorrectional Center, in Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action on February 10, 2022, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.   (D.I. 1).  Plaintiff  appears pro se and proceeds in forma \npauperis .  He requests counsel.  (D.I. 4 , 12, 18).  The Court proceeds to screen the \nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a).     \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Portions of Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint are illegible.  As alleged,  the \ndates  of occurrence are from October 2021 to January 19, 2022.  (D.I. 1 at 5).  As best \nas can be discerned, Plaintiff has a history of suicide attempts.   (Id.).  At the time he \ncommenced this action he had been housed at JTVCC for six months.  ( Id.).  It appears \nhe has attempted suicide at least twice since December 2019.  ( Id.). \nPlaintiff submitted a grievance on December 17, 2021, complaining of severe \nskull pain.  (D.I. 1 -1 at 1).  The grievance was returned unprocessed for Plaintiff\u2019s failure \nto su bmit a sick call slip.  ( Id.).  The grievance states that \u201cpatient was on PCO ( i.e., \npsychiatric close observation) and being monitored by nursing; patient c/o pain the 17th, \npain was addressed with no further complaints.\u201d  ( Id.). \nOn December 29, 2021, Plaintiff  stopped breathing while in the back of a  \nDepartment of Correction transport vehicle enroute to the hospital.  ( D.I. 1  at 6).   Plaintiff \nalleges that Defendant Officer Guthrie neglected to administer CPR.  ( Id.).  The 2 \n Complaint refers to other individuals present at the time, none of whom are named \ndefendants.  ( Id.).  It appears that on a nother date, officers  witnessed Plaintif f\u2019s bloody \ncell, entered it, and administ ered treatment to Plaintiff , who was in pain.  ( Id. at 7).  \nPlaintiff submitted a grievance on January 2, 2022, that while he was laying down in his \ncell, he  started bleeding from his ear.  (D.I. 1- 1 at 3).  \n Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages  and injunctive relief .  (Id. at 8).  \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe act ion is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013).  S ee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis  actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant) .  The C ourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se  plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007).  Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se , his pleading is liberally construed and his \nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held t o less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.     \n\u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindispu tably meritless legal \ntheory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   3 \n  The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted purs uant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).  \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has s ubstantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id. at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016).  Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a 4 \n \u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand c ommon sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \n Personal Involvement/Respondeat Superior .  The Complaint contains no \nallegations directed towards Defendants D elaware Department of Correction \nCommissioner Monroe B. Hudson (he is named as a defendant twice), Warden  Robert  \nMay, or Sergeant Goedemuz .   To the extent Hudson and May are named as \ndefendants, i t is well- established that t here is no respondeat superior liability under \u00a7 \n1983.   See Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016).   In addition, the \nComplaint does not allege the personal involvement of any of the foregoing defendants.  \nClaims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 require a showing that each defendant \nwas personally involved in the alleged wrongdoing.  Evancho v. Fisher , 423 F.3d 347, \n353 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988)).   \nThere are no such allegations.   Therefore, the claims against Hudson, May and Goedemuz will be dismissed.  \n Medical Claim .  Plaintiff attempts to raise a  medical needs claim against Officer \nGuthrie.  To set forth a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim for inadequate medical \ncare, a prisoner must allege (1) a serious medical need and (2) acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate deliberate indifference to that need.   Estelle v. Gamble, 429 \nU.S. 97, 104 (1976).  A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he or she knows that a \nprisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to \navoid the harm.  Farmer v. Brenn an, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).   In addition, allegations \nof medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.  White v. 5 \n Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 108- 09 (3d Cir. 1990); see also Daniels v. Williams , 474 U.S. \n327, 332- 34 (1986) (negligence is not compensable as a c onstitutional deprivation).  \nFinally, mere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment is insufficient to state a \nconstitutional violation.  See Spruill v. Gillis , 372 F.3d 218, 235 (3d Cir. 2004).  \n Here, Plaintiff a lleges that that Guthrie \u201cneglected to administer CPR.\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \n6).  Even when reading the Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he fails to \nstate an actionable constitutional claim against anyone f or deliberate indifference to a \nserious medical need.  At most, he alleges negligence.  Therefore, the claim will be \ndismis sed.    \nRequest for Counsel . Plaint iff has filed three requests for counsel.  (D.I. 4, 12, \n18).  A pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis  has no constitutional or statutory \nright to representation by counsel.1  See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d \nCir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace , 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).  However, representation \nby counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a finding that a \nplaintiff =s claim has arguable merit in fact and law.  Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.  \nAfter passing this threshold inquir y, the Court should consider a number of \nfactors when assessing a request for counsel.  Factors to be considered by a court in deciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the merits of the plaintiff\u2019 s claim; (2) the plaintiff \u2019s ability to present his or her case \n \n1See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa , 490 U.S. 296 (1989)  \n(\u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7 1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling \nattorney to represent an indigent civil lit igant, the operative word in the statute being \n\u201crequest.\u201d).   6 \n considering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon \nhim or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to \nwhich factual investigation is req uired and the plaintiff \u2019s ability to pursue such \ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiff \u2019s capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and \n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony.  \nSee Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498- 99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at \n155-56.  The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative.  Tabron, 6 F.3d \nat 157.   \nAt this juncture, it is far from clear that Plaintiff\u2019s claims have merit.  All claims \nhave been dismissed, and Plaintiff will be given leave to amend.  As there is no viable \ncomplaint, Plaintiff\u2019s requests for counsel will be denied without prejudice to renew.  \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will : (1) deny without prejudice to renew \nPlaintiff\u2019s request s for counsel (D.I. 4, 12, 18); (2) dismiss the Complaint for failure to \nstate claim s upon which relief can  be granted  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (ii) \nand \u00a7 1915A(b) (1); and (3) give Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint . \nAn ap propriate O rder will be entered.
