(D.I. 47). I have \nconsidered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 48, 51, 53). For the following reasons, Defendants ' \nmotion is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Bench Walk Lighting sued Defendants LG Innotek, LG Electronics USA, and \nLG Electronics ( collectively \"LG\") for infringement of ten patents that cover various \ntechnologies used in LED products. (D.I. 44). The patents-at-suit are U.S. Patent Nos.: \n6,325,524 (\"the '524 Patent), 6,806,658 (\"the '658 Patent\"), 7,115,428 (\"the '428 Patent\"), \n7,470,936 (\"the '936 Patent\"), 7,519,287 (\"the '287 Patent\"), 7,847,300 (\"the '300 Patent\"), \n7,488,990 (\"the '990 Patent\"), 9,209,373 (\"the '373 Patent\"), 9,882,094 (\"the '094 Patent\"), and \n9,887,338 (\"the '338 Patent\"). (D.I. 44 at ,r 28). The operative complaint is the Second \nAmended Complaint (\"SAC\"). (D.I. 44). LG seeks dismissal of Bench Walk's induced and \nwillful infringement claims. (D.I. 48). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Motion to Dismiss \nRule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief.\" Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). When reviewing a \nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court must accept \nthe complaint's factual allegations as true. See id. at 555-56. The factual allegations do not have \nto be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, conclusions , or a \"formulaic recitation\" of \nthe claim elements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if \n2 doubtful in fact).\"). There must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to \nrelief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied \nwhen the complaint 's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. at 665. \nB. Induced Infringement \nSection 271 (b) of the Patent Act provides, \"Whoever actively induces infringement of a \npatent shall be liable as an infringer. \" 35. U.S.C. 271(b). \"For an allegation of induced \ninfringement to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must plead facts plausibly showing that \nthe accused infringer specifically intended another party to infringe the patent and knew that the \nother party's acts constituted infringement. \" Lifetime Indus., Inc. v. Trim-Lok, Inc., 869 F.3d \n1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). \nC. Willful Infringement \nUnder section 284 of the Patent Act, a court can provide for enhanced damages if \ninfringement is found. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284. Such damages are available \"in a case of willful or bad\u00ad\nfaith infringement. \" Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 579 U.S. 93, 100 (2016). To state a \nclaim for willful infringement , a pleading must allege: \"facts from which it can be plausibly \ninferred that the party accused of infringement ( 1) had knowledge of or was willfully blind to the \nexistence of the asserted patent and (2) had knowledge of or was willfully blind to the fact that \nthe party's alleged conduct constituted, induced, or contributed to infringement of the asserted \npatent.\" Dynamic Data Techs., LLC v. Amlogic Holdings Ltd., 2020 WL 4365809, at *5 (D. Del. \nJuly 30, 2020). \n3 III. DISCUSSION \nA. Knowledge \nTo state a claim for both induced infringement and willful infringement, Bench Walk \nmust allege sufficient facts to plausibly show that LG was aware of the patents-in-suit and the \ninfringement. LG argues that Bench Walk has failed to plead knowledge. (D.I. 48 at 1-2). \nBench Walk asserts that the SAC pleads three facts supporting knowledge. (D .I. 51 at 6-11 ). \nFirst, a notice letter sent to LG Innotek on May 25, 2019.1 Second, LG's part ownership in the \npatent aggregator Intellectual Discovery. Third, service of the original complaint. \nLG first argues that Bench Walk has conceded its argument that the notice letter plausibly \npleads pre-suit knowledge and is thus precluded from making the argument now. (D.I. 48 at 4). \nI disagree. While the magistrate judge found (D.I. 36 at 24), and I agreed (D.I. 42 at 9), that \nBench Walk conceded the argument in its briefing opposing LG's motion to dismiss the first \namended complaint, Bench Walk has submitted a second amended complaint. I will therefore \nconsider Bench Walk's properly raised arguments in the present briefing. \nI find that the notice letter sufficiently pleads knowledge for the eight patents-in-suit \nlisted in the letter. The letter lists many LG products and states, \"These products, and others \nmade, used, sold, offered for sale, or imported into the United States by LG, infringe many of the \npatents in [Bench Walk's] portfolio.\" (D.I. 25-1 at 1-2). The letter then enumerates eleven \npatents, including eight of the ten patents-in-suit. (Id.) \n1 In their briefing, the parties also describe the notice letter as \"The May 29, 2019 Letter.\" (D.I. \n48 at 2, 4; D.I. 51 at 6). The SAC pleads a date of May 25, 2019 and the notice letter has a date \nof May 25, 2019. (D.I. 44 at ,r 67; D.I. 51-1 at 1). Thus, I will refer to the letter as the \"May 25, \n2019\" letter. \n4 LG argues, \"There is no tying of any specific claim of any specific patent to any specific \nfeature of any specific product. Thus, the May 25, 2019 letter fails to put [LG Innotek] on notice \nof how it is alleged to be infringing the patents listed in the letter.\" (D.I. 48 at 5). There is no \nrequirement that a plaintiff pleads notice of how specific product features infringe specific \npatents. A plaintiff must plead, as Bench Walk has, that defendants had (1) knowledge of the \npatents-in-suit and (2) knowledge of infringement. See Cammi! USA, LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc., \n575 U.S. 632,639 (2015). Bench Walk has a case as to the eight patents starting on May 25, \n2019. \nLG also argues that the notice letter, which is addressed only to LG Innotek, does not put \nthe other defendants on notice. (D.I. 48 at 5-6). Bench Walk responds, \"It is a fair inference that \nLG Innotek shared the Notice Letter with its parent and sister entities that are also involved in \nthe manufacturing and selling the infringing products identified in the notice letter.\" (D.I. 51 at \n8). I agree. The SAC has pled, \"Defendants are related entities that operate as part of a \ncorporate group or common business enterprise[.]\" (D.I. 44 at ,r 8). Construing the facts in the \nlight most favorable to Bench Walk, I find that the SAC plausibly alleges notice to all defendants \nas to the eight patents-in-suit listed in the notice letter. \nFor the two patents not listed in the notice letter, I agree with LG that Bench Walk has \nfailed to allege pre-suit knowledge. Aside from the May 25, 2019 notice letter, Bench Walk \npleads knowledge based on LG's 20% ownership in the patent aggregator Intellectual Discovery . \nIntellectual Discovery once owned the asserted patents. The SAC alleges: \nIntellectual Discovery focuses on pooling patents to protect South Korean industry, \nincluding Korean technology companies such as LG. Additionally , Intellectual Discovery \nsought to protect LG from enforcement of Plaintiffs patent portfolio. Therefore, LG \nwould have had actual knowledge of Intellectual Discovery's patent portfolio, including \nthe '524 patent. \n5 (D.I. 44 at ,r 44). An ownership stake in such a corporation , without more, is not enough to \nplausibly plead pre-suit knowledge. Bench Walk argues, \"Publicly available information will \nnot uncover the correspondence between Intellectual Discovery and Defendants. \" (D.I. 51 at 9). \nThis may be true, but there are no facts pled in the complaint that support an inference that LG \nhad actual knowledge oflntellectual Discovery 's patent holdings. Compare Soft View v. Apple, \n2012 WL 3061027, at *6 (D. Del. July 26, 2012) (finding ownership in patent aggregator \nsufficient to show knowledge where the plaintiff pled that the aggregator provided member \ncompanies with updates regarding patents of interest). Thus, I agree with LG that Bench Walk \nhas failed to plead pre-suit knowledge of the '658 and '990 patents and dismiss the pre-suit \ninduced and willful infringement claims in Counts Two and Seven. \nBecause there is no pre-suit knowledge of the '658 and '990 patents, I will grant LG's \nmotion with respect to post-suit willfulness for Counts One and Seven. As for induced \ninfringement , the service of Bench Walk's original complaint can serve as notice. See Wrinkl, \nInc. v. Facebook, Inc., 2021 WL 4477022, at *6-8 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021). It is true, as LG \nargues, that one of the defendants was not named in the original complaint. (D.I. 48 at 8). As \ndiscussed above, in this context notice to one entity can be imputed to the other defendants. \nThus, I will grant LG's motion to dismiss pre-suit induced infringement claims and the \nwillful infringement claims in their entirety in Counts Two and Seven. Those claims are \ndismissed without prejudice. \nB. Count Five Induced Infringement \nLG advances another argument regarding Count Five: Bench Walk fails to plausibly \nallege inducement. (D.I. 48 at 10). Count Five of the SAC alleges, \"Defendants ' United States \nwebsite instructs customers to use the '287 Accused Products in numerous infringing \n6 applications \" including \"incorporat[ing] Defendants ' Accused Products in electronic devices \nsuch as smartphones and electronic displays using Defendants ' provided data sheets and \ntechnical manuals.\" (D.I. 44 at 1152). In a footnote, the SAC states, \"LG Innotek's website \nhttp://www.lginnotek.com provides data sheet and product manuals that inform its customers of \nthe specifications of the '287 Accused Products and encourage their customers to infringe. See, \ne.g., Exhibit M.\" (D.I. 44 at 1152 n.5). Exhibit Mis an LG Innotek product catalog. \nLG argues that a general citation to a website is insufficient to show inducement , and that \nthe only specific document cited in support of the SAC's allegations \"contains no reference any \nFlash Module 4040 product.\" (D.I. 48 at 10). Bench Walk responds that (1) the SAC alleges \nthat products \"substantiall y similar\" to the Flash Module 4040 also infringe, (2) whether Exhibit \nM includes the Flash Module 4040 is a factual inquiry that cannot be decided at the motion to \ndismiss stage, and (3) the website referenced also provides data sheets of substantially similar \nproducts. (D.I. 51 at 11-12). \nI agree with Bench Walk. At this stage, I am required to accept Bench Walk's well-pled \nfacts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in Bench Walk's favor. See Mayer v. Belichick , \n605 F.3d 223,229 (3d Cir. 2010). The facts pled support a reasonable inference that there are \nproducts described on LG Innotek's website that infringe the '287 Patent. While it is true that \nExhibit M does not specifically reference the \"Flash Module 4040\" product, there is a reasonable \ninference that the products in the catalog either incorporate the Flash Module 4040 or are \nsubstantially similar to the Flash Module 4040. Thus, I will deny LG's motion to dismiss \ninduced infringement as to Count Five of the SAC. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n7 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nBENCH WALK LIGHTING LLC, \nPlaintiff; \nV. \nLG INNOTEK CO., LTD., LG \nELECTRONICS U.S.A., INC., and LG \nELECTRONICS INC., \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 20-51-RGA \nORDER \nFor the reasons stated in the accompanying memorandum opinion, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that Defendants ' motion to dismiss (D.I. 47) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED\u00ad\nIN-PART. Defendants' motion is GRANTED with respect to pre-suit induced infringement \nclaims and all willful infringement claims for Counts 2 and 7. These claims are DISMISSED \nWITHOUT PREJUDICE. Defendants' motion to dismiss is otherwise DENIED. The Second \nAmended Complaint (\"SAC,\" D.I. 44) has pled induced infringement and willful infringement \nstarting May 25, 2019, the date of the notice letter, for Counts 1, 3-6, and 8-10. The SAC has \npled induced infringement for Claims 2 and 7 starting January 14, 2020, the date of the original \ncomplaint. \nEntered this 4th day of January, 2022. "}
