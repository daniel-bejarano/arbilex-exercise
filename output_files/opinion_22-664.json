Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n November 7, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Karriem Theodore Douglass, a former pretrial detainee at Howard R. \nYoung Correctional Center in Wilmington, Delaware,  filed this action pursuant to  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983.   (D.I. 3).  He appears pro se  and has been granted leave to proceed in \nforma pauperis .  (D.I. 5, 15).  The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a).     \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff raises medical needs claims. (D.I. 3). Plaintiff was a \npretrial detainee at HRYCI when he commenced this action.  He has since been \nreleased.  He was prescribed mental health medication (\u201cminipress\u201d) by Defen dant Dr. \nQazi, and it was administered by  Defendant  Nurse Fisher  on February 1, 2022.  (Id. at \n5, 8).   Plaintiff reacted badly to the medication and was taken to \u201c medical \u201d where it was \ndiscovered that he had been overmedicated.  ( Id. at 6).   Plaintiff was monitored in the \ninfirmary and discharged on February 2, 2022 at 5:30 p.m .  (Id.).  Plaintiff had chest \npains around 1:00 a.m. and was taken to the infirmary  for an EKG and then transferred \nto the hospital where he was told he had suffered a heart attack.  ( Id.).  Plaintiff was \nhospitalized and received treatment, discharged and returned to the prison infirmary \nwhere he was discharged on February 14, 2022.  ( Id. at 6 -7).  Plaintiff had a second \nheart attack the next day and was taken to the hospital due to complications from the treatment he received during the first visit to the hospital , treated, and returned to the 2 \n prison infirmary where he stayed until March 5, 2022.  (Id. at 7).  Plaintiff alleges th at \nhad mental health personnel look ed at his chart, they would have known that the \nprescribed mental health medication combined with his blood pressure medication \nwould cause the cardiac arrest.  ( Id.).   \n Plaintiff sought  alternative mental health medication to help with his mental \nhealth issues for some time and was recently told by Defendant Jennifer  that he is no \nlonger on the mental health roster and must submit a sick call slip to obtain mental \nhealth treatment.  ( Id. at 8).   Plaint iff states  that it is wrong that he must submit a sick \ncall slip to receive mental health treatment.  ( Id. at 8 -9).  In addition, Plaintiff complains \nthat he suffers from injuries to his right side, shoulder, ribs, arm, leg and back, and has \nreceived only pain medication and x -rays.  ( Id. at 9).  Defendant Abraham told Plaintiff \nthat he would heal over time.  ( Id.).   \n Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.  ( Id. at 11). \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary \nrelief from a  defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013).  S ee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant).  The C ourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of 3 \n Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007) .  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. at 94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantas tic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .    \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U. S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant P laintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted.  See id . at 1 1.  4 \n  A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016).  Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \n As a pretrial detainee, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \naffords Plaintiff protection for his medical needs claim.  Ingraham v. Wright , 430 U.S. \n651, 671- 72 n.40 (1977) .  When evaluating whether a claim for inadequate medical  care \nby a pre- trial detainee is sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Third Circuit \nhas \u201cfound no reason to apply a different standard than that set forth in\u201d  Estelle v. \nGamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976).  Natale v. Camden County Correctional Facility , 318 F.3d \n575, 581 (3d Cir. 2003).   \n A prison official\u2019s \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\u201d \nis a kind of cruel and unusual punishment \u201cproscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d  \nEstelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).  See also Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, \n511 (2011) (when a prison deprives a prisoner of adequate medical care, courts have a 5 \n responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth Amendment violation); Farmer v. Brennan, \n511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (under the Eighth A mendment , prison officials must ensure \ninmates receive adequate medical care).  \nIn order to set forth a cognizable claim, an inmate must allege (i) a serious \nmedical need and (ii) acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate deliberate \nindifference t o that need.  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. at 104; Rouse v. Plantier , 182 \nF.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999).  A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he knows that \na prisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to  \navoid the harm.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. at  837.  A \u201cprison official may manifest \ndeliberate indifference by intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care.\u201d  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. at 104- 05.  A \u201c failure to provide adequate care . . . [that] \nwas deliberate, and motivated by non medical factors \u201d is actionable under the Eighth \nAmendment, but \u201d inadequate care [that] was a result of an error in medical judgment \u201d is \nnot.  Durmer v. O\u2019Carroll , 991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993).   \n In addition, \u201ca prisoner does not have the  right \u2018to choose a specific form of \nmedical treatment .\u2019\u201d  Lasko v. Watts, 373 F. App\u2019x 196, 203 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting \nHarrison v. Barkley , 219 F.3d 132, 138- 40 (2d Cir. 2000)).  An inmate\u2019s claims against \nmember s of a prison medical department are not viable under \u00a7 1983 where the inmate \nreceives continuing care, but believes that more should be done by way of diagnosis and treatment and maintains that options available to medical personnel were not pursued on the inmate\u2019s behalf.  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. at 107.  In addition, \nallegations of medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a constitutional 6 \n violation.  See White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 108- 09 (3d Cir. 1990); see also \nDaniels v. Williams , 474 U.S. 327, 332- 34 (1986) (negligence is not compensable as a \nconstitutional deprivation).  \n As pled, the allegations fail to state cognizable medical needs claims.  Plaintiff \nclaims that  Dr. Qazi prescribed the wrong medication and that Nurse Fisher \nadministered the medication.  At most, this alleges negligence.  Plaintiff alleges that \nJennifer told Plaintiff he must submit a sick call slip to receive mental health treatment.  \nPlaintiff believes this is wrong and labels this as a denial of ment al health care.  To the \ncontrary, Plaintiff is not denied mental health care.  He simply needs to ask for it by \nsubmit ting a sick call slip.  Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Abraham told Plaintiff that he \nwould heal over time.  This scant sentence falls far  short of a constitutional violation.   \nAccordingly , while the Complaint  may or may not state a claim for medical malpractice \nagainst Dr. Qazi  and/or Nurse Fisher , it does not state any federal claims upon which \nrelief can be granted, and the claims against  Jennifer and Abraham as alleged are \nfrivolous .  \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint as partly  frivolous \nand for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B) (i) & (ii) and 1915A( b)(1).  The Court suspects amendment  would be futile , \nbut will nevertheless give Plaintiff one opportunity to amend his complaint . \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.
