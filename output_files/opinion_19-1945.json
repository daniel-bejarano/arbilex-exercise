WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nIn this action filed by Plaintiff VoiceAge EVS LLC (\"VoiceAge\") against Defendant HMD \nGlobal Oy (\"HMD\"), VoiceAge alleges infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,693,710 (\"the '710 \npatent\"), 8,401,843 (\"the '843 patent\"), 8,990,073 (\"the '073 patent\") and 8,825,475 (\"the '475 \npatent\"), and 9,852,741 (\"the '741 patent\"). Before the Court is the issue of claim construction of \nmultiple terms in these patents. The Court has considered the parties' joint claim construction brief \nand the accompanying appendix and declarations. D.I. 88, 89, 90, 91. The Court held a claim \nconstruction hearing on November 30, 2022. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v. \nSumitomo Elec. US.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"A claim in a patent provides \nthe metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling the protected invention \"). \"[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for \nconducting claim construction.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the \nappropriate weight to appropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent \nlaw.\" Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question oflaw, although \nsubsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary . Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct. \n831, 837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 372 (1996)). \n\"The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as \nunderstood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and prosecution history.\" Thorner v. Sony Comput. Ent. Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. \n2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art \"is deemed to \nread the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term \nappears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at \nat 1313. \n\"When construing claim terms, the court first looks to, and primarily rely on, the intrinsic \nevidence, including the claims themselves, the specification, and the prosecution history of the \npatent, which is usually dispositive .\" Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d \n1271, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \"Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted, \ncan ... be valuable\" in discerning the meaning of a disputed claim term because \"claim terms are \nnormally used consistently throughout the patent,\" and so, \"the usage of a term in one claim can \noften illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In \naddition, \"[d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide[.]\" Id For example, \"the \npresence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the \nlimitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id at 1314-15. \nIn addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification, which \"is always highly \nrelevant to the claim construction analysis ... [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a \ndisputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is \nalso possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the \npatentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's \nlexicography governs.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \"Even when the specification describes only \na single embodiment, [however ,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the \npatentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of \n2 manifest exclusion or restriction .\" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 \n(Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., \n358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification \"is not a substitute for, nor can it be \nused to rewrite, the chosen claim language.\" SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d \n870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \nThe Court \"should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence. \" \nMarkman , 52 F.3d at 980. The prosecution history \"can often inform the meaning of the claim \nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor \nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution[.] \" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. \nIn some cases, the Court \"will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \"consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony , dictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \"less significant than the intrinsic \nrecord in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n3 II.

DISPUTED TERMS \n1. \"transmitting\" and \"transmission from an encoder to a decoder\" \nPlaintiff Defendant HMD's The Court's Disputed Term VoiceAge's Construction Construction Construction \n\"transmitting\" transmitting across a transmitting over a Plain and ordinary communication communication ('710 patent, claims meaning channel channel 4, 16, 17, 24) \n\"transmission from transmission from an \nan encoder to a encoder to a decoder transmission from an \ndecoder\" Plain and ordinary encoder to a decoder across a over a communication meanmg communication (' 710 patent, claims channel \n4, 16, 17, 24) channel \nInitially, the parties disputed whether \"transmitting \" and \"transmission from an encoder to \na decoder\" must occur across a communication channel ( as HMD contends) or whether those \ndisputed terms can be understood according to their plain and ordinary meaning (as VoiceAge \ncontends) . D.I. 88 at 7. During the claim construction hearing, the parties agreed that transmission \noccurs \"over\" a communication channel, but dispute whether the claims require the transmission \nto be received by the decoder. Tr. 38:8-13; 42:13-19; 47:4-9. According to VoiceAge , because \nthe plain and ordinary meaning of\"transmitting \" is \"sending\", the claims are \"agnostic to whether \ndata is received.\" Tr. 32:2-3; 34:15-22. In response, HMD contends that VoiceAge interprets \ntransmitting to mean \"broadcasting towards a communication channel\" and that the claims \n\"require some sort of reception by the decoder of concealment parameters \" to make sense for the \ndevice to work. Tr. 45:22-23; 46:25-47:9. \nThese terms appear in independent method claim 4 and device claims 16, 17, and 24 of the \n'710 patent, as well as in each claim's preamble. Claim 4 recites: \n6 A method of concealing frame erasure caused by frames of an \nencoded sound signal erased during transmission from an encoder \nto a decoder, comprising: \ndetermining, in the encoder, concealment/recovery parameters \nselected from the group consisting of a signal classification \nparameter , an energy information parameter, and a phase \ninformation parameter related to the sound signal; \ntransmitting to the decoder concealment/recovery parameters \ndetermined in the encoder; and \nm the decoder, conducting frame erasure concealment and \ndecoder recovery in response to the received concealment/ \nrecovery parameters ; \nwherein: \nthe sound signal is a speech signal; \ndetermining, in the encoder, concealment/recovery parameters \ncomprises classifying successive frames of the encoded \nsound signal as unvoiced, unvoiced transition, voiced \ntransition, voiced, or onset; and \ndetermining concealment/recovery parameters comprises \ncalculating the energy information parameter in relation to a \nmaximum of a signal energy for frames classified as voiced \nor onset, and calculating the energy information parameter \nin relation to an average energy per sample for other frames. \n'710 patent at cl. 4 (emphasis added). Claim 16 recites: \nA device for conducting concealment of frame erasure caused by \nframes of an encoded sound signal erased during transmission from \nan encoder to a decoder, comprising: \nin the encoder, a determiner of concealment/recovery parameters \nselected from the group consisting of a signal classification \nparameter , an energy information parameter and a phase \ninformation parameter related to the sound signal; and \na communication link for transmitting to the decoder \nconcealment/ recovery parameters determined in the encoder; \nwherein: \nthe decoder conducts frame erasure concealment and decoder \nrecovery in response to the concealment/recovery parameters \nreceived from the encoder; \nthe sound signal is a speech signal; \nthe determiner of concealment/recovery parameters comprises a \nclassifier of successive frames of the encoded sound signal as \nunvoiced, unvoiced transition, voiced transition, voiced, or \nonset; and \nthe determiner of concealment/recovery parameters comprises a \ncomputer of the energy information parameter in relation to a \n7 maximum of a signal energy for frames classified as voiced \nor onset, and in relation to an average energy per sample for \nother frames. \n'710 patent at cl. 16 (emphasis added). Claim 17 recites: \nA device for conducting concealment of frame erasure caused by \nframes of an encoded sound signal erased during transmission from \nan encoder to a decoder, comprising: \nin the encoder, a determiner of concealment/recovery parameters \nselected from the group consisting of a signal classification \nparameter , an energy information parameter and a phase \ninformation parameter related to the sound signal; and \na communication link for transmitting to the decoder \nconcealment/ recovery parameters determined in the encoder; \nwherein: \nthe decoder conducts frame erasure concealment and decoder \nrecovery in response to concealment/recovery parameters \nreceived from the encoder; and \nfor conducting frame erasure concealment and decoder recovery: \nthe decoder controls an energy of a synthesized sound signal \nproduced by the decoder by scaling the synthesized sound \nsignal to render an energy of said synthesized sound signal at \nthe beginning of a first non erased frame received following \nframe erasure similar to an energy of said synthesized sound \nsignal at the end of a last frame erased during said frame \nerasure; and \nthe decoder converges the energy of the synthesized sound signal \nin the received first non erased frame to an energy \ncorresponding to the received energy information parameter \ntoward the end of said received first non erased frame while \nlimiting an increase in energy. \n'710 patent at cl. 17 (emphasis added). Claim 24 recites: \nA device for conducting concealment of frame erasure caused by \nframes of an encoded sound signal erased during transmission from \nan encoder to a decoder, comprising: \nin the encoder, a determiner of concealment/recovery parameters \nselected from the group consisting of a signal classification \nparameter, an energy information parameter and a phase \ninformation parameter related to the sound signal; and \na communication link for transmitting to the decoder \nconcealment/ recovery parameters determined in the encoder; \nwherein: \nthe sound signal is a speech signal; \n8 the determiner of concealment/recovery parameters comprises a \nclassifier of successive frames of the encoded sound signal as \nunvoiced, unvoiced transition, voiced transition, voiced, or \nonset; and \nthe determiner of concealment/recovery parameters comprises a \ncomputer of the energy information parameter in relation to a \nmaximum of a signal energy for frames classified as voiced \nor onset, and in relation to an average energy per sample for \nother frames. \n'710 patent at cl. 24 (emphasis added). \nStarting with the claims, in each instance, \"transmission \" refers to transmission of \"an \nencoded sound signal\" \"from an encoder to a decoder.\" '710 patent at cl. 4, 16, 17, 24. Further, \n\"transmitting\" appears in every asserted independent claim in the context of transmitting \n\"concealment/recovery parameters \" to the decoder from the encoder. '710 patent at els. 1-5, 8, 10-\n11, 13-17, 20, 22-24. Thus, the claims on their face contemplate the decoder as the destination for \nthe concealment/recovery parameters . The claims do not, for example, recite a transmission from \nan encoder without identifying the transmission 's destination-here, the decoder. \nTurning to the specification, the present invention is described as \"relat[ing] to robust \nencoding and decoding of sound signals to maintain good performance in case of erased frame(s) \ndue, for example, to channel errors in wireless systems or lost packets in voice over packet network \napplications.\" '710 patent at 1:21-25. The illustrative embodiments describe a \"speech \ncommunication system depicting the use of speech encoding and decoding\" that \"supports \ntransmission of a speech signal across a communication channel.\" '710 patent at 4: 19-27. Indeed, \nthe specification only describes transmitting an encoded sound signal to a decoder \"over a \ncommunication channel.\" '710 patent at 1 :45-53 (\"A speech encoder converts a speech signal into \na digital bit stream which is transmitted over a communication channel or stored in a storage \nmedium .... The speech decoder or synthesizer operates on the transmitted ... bit stream and \n9 converts it back to a sound signal.\"); 4:27-29 (\"The speech communication system ... supports \ntransmission of a speech signal across a communication channel ... \"). Thus, the intrinsic record \nsupports a construction that contemplates a transmission occurring over a communication channel. \nVoiceAge points to one instance in the specification to argue that \"transmitting \" need not \noccur \"across a communication channel\" because \"the inventors used the word 'transmitted ' to \nrefer to conveying information from the encoder to a multiplexer.\" D.I. 88 at 10 (citing '710 patent \nat 7:66-8:1 (\"The pitch codebook index Tis encoded and transmitted to the multiplexer ... for \ntransmission through a communication channel.\"). That example, however, does not involve \n\"transmission \" of the \"encoded sound signal\" from an encoder to a decoder\" ('710 patent at cl. 4, \n16, 17, 24) or transmitting \"concealment/recovery parameters\" to the decoder from the encoder \n('710 patent at els. 1-5, 8, 10-11, 13-17, 20, 22-24) as set forth in the claim language . \nV oiceAge also contends that HMD' s construction requiring \"transmission from an encoder \nto a decoder\" to occur \"across a communication channel\" implicitly requires signals transmitted \n\"to\" a decoder to be received-a limitation VoiceAge describes as improper because a \n\"transmitted\" signal \"need not traverse the entire path between a transmitter and a receiver.\" D.I. \n88 at 9; Id. (\"Indeed, the written description and the claims acknowledge that signals transmitted \n'to' a decoder need not be received.\"). However , as described supra, the claims contemplate a \ndestination for the signals-the decoder. Further, the specification consistently describes frame \nerasure concealment as occurring upon receipt of the signal by the decoder. See, e.g., '710 patent \nat 2:58-63 (\"The present invention relates to a method for improving concealment of frame erasure \ncaused by frames of an encoded sound signal erased during transmission from an encoder to a \ndecoder, and for accelerating recovery of the decoder after non erased frames of the encoded sound \nsignal have been received ... \"); id. at 3 :4-9 (\"The present invention also relates to ... accelerating \n10 recovery of the decoder after non erased frames of the encoded sound signal have been received\"). \nIndeed, the parties agree that at least some frames sent out by the encoder are received by the \ndecoder. Tr. 44:21-22; 48:19-22. \nThe Court, however, declines to import a limitation into the claims requmng all \nconcealment/recovery parameters to be received by the decoder. While HMD contends that \"if \nthe decoder does not receive concealment/recovery parameters that are transmitted from the \nencoder, then frame erasure concealment does not occur ... and the claimed method would not \noccur at all,\" Tr. 45:15-19, the Federal Circuit has stated that \"the claims need not recite every \ncomponent necessary to enable operation of a working device.\" Markem-Imaje Corp. v. Zipher \nLtd., 657 F.3d 1293, 1300-01 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (quoting Rambus Inc. v. Infineon Tech. AG, 318 \nF .3d 1081, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 2003)) (\"That a device will only operate if certain elements are included \nis not grounds to incorporate those elements into the construction of the claims. A claim to an \nengine providing motive power to a car should not be construed to incorporate a limitation for an \nexhaust pipe, though an engine may not function without one. Thus, though \"some method of \nderiving a tension measurement\" may be required to make a claimed device operational, it is not \nproper to incorporate that method into the claim construction.\"). Here, the claims, as a matter of \ntheir construction, require the transmission of concealment/recovery parameters to travel over a \ncommunications channel, but not more. \nAccordingly, at this stage, 1 the Court construes \"transmitting\" as \"transmitting over a \ncommunication channel\" and \"transmission from an encoder to a decoder\" as \"transmission from \nan encoder to a decoder over a communication channel.\" \n1 \"[C]laim construction is rolling and it is within the Court's discretion to clarify and revise \nclaim constructions at any point before the case goes to the jury.\" Dali Wireless, Inc. v. \n11 2. \"communication link\" \nDisputed Term Plaintiff VoiceAge's Defendant HMD's The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"communication a connection between two link\" a portion of a devices across a a connection between \ntwo devices over a \n(' 710 patent, communication communication channel communication \nclaims 16, 17, channel channel \n24) In the alternative , indefinite.2 \nThe parties dispute whether a \"communication link\" requires an end-to-end connection \nbetween two devices across a communication channel (as HMD contends) or whether \n\"communication link\" simply means a portion o f a communication channel, such as a fiber optic \nor wire link (as VoiceAge contends) . D.I. 88 at 25. \nStarting with the claims, \"communication link\" appears in independent claims 16, 17, and \n24 of the '710 patent, each of which recite: \"a communication link for transmitting to the decoder \nconcealment/recovery parameters determined in the encoder.\" '710 patent at els. 16, 17, 24. Claims \n16 and 17 further recite \"a communication link for transmitting to the decoder . . . parameters \ndetermined in the encoder; wherein: the decoder conducts ... concealment ... in response to [] \nparameters received from the encoder.\" '710 patent at els. 16, 17. Thus, on their face, the claims \ncontemplate that a \"communication link\" facilitates a connection between two points. \nWhile the specification does not use the term \"communication link\" (the term was \nintroduced as a claim amendment without explanation , see D.I. 89-1 at JA0758-59 , JA0761-64 ), \nCommScope Techs. LLC, C.A. No. 19-952 (MN), 2022 WL 621547, at *5 n.2 (D. Del. Mar. 3, \n2022). \n2 As HMD did not brief its position on indefiniteness in the Joint Claim Construction Brief, \nthe Court will not consider it. \n12 the specification ( as shown in Figure 1) describes a \"communication channel\" that the parties agree \nis \"a connection between a transmitting device ( e.g., a mobile phone that transmits an encoded \nsound signal) and a receiving device ( e.g., a mobile phone that receives an encoded sound signal).\" \nD.I. 88 at 26-27, 29. That is, a speech signal travels from the channel encoder, through the \ncommunications channel, to the channel decoder. \n104 106 108 100 101 I \nAID 105 Speech 107 Channel \nEtlcoder E.ncooer \nllS llO 109 Ctmunnni.catioo \nChannel \nSpeech 112 Channel l1l \nDecoder Decoder \n::;\"\"u;:5 l \nThe specification further describes that the \"communication channel\" may be comprised of \"a \nwire, an optical link or a fiber link, [and] ... at least in part a radio frequency link.\" '710 patent at \n4:25-35. \nVoiceAge, focusing on the specification 's use of the word \"link\" and the phrase \"at least \nin part\", argues that a \"communication link\" must, therefore , be a portion of a communication \nchannel; \"otherwise, reference to a radio frequency link comprising a part of the communication \nchannel would not make sense.\" D.I. 88 at 34; Tr. 51 :11-13 (\"This 'at least in part' suggesting that \nit can be multiple links and multiple types of medium, so wire, optical, fiber, or radiofrequency .\"). \nHowever , while the wire, optical, fiber, and radio-frequency links may each be \"a portion of a \ncommunication channel,\" the intrinsic record suggests that a \"communication link\" is broader, \nreferring to what connects the two devices across the entire \"channel.\" For example, the \n13 specification, by disclosing that a storage device can replace the communications channel, suggests \nthat a \"communications link\" encompasses more than just the wire, optical, fiber, and radio-\nfrequency links comprising the communications channel. See '710 patent at 4:35-39 (\"Although \nnot shown, the communication channel ... may be replaced by a storage device in a single device \nembodiment of the system . . . that records and stores the encoded speech signal for later \nplayback.\"). This disclosure suggests that a \"communications link\" is not simply a portion of the \ncommunications channel. \nFurther, that a skilled artisan would understand \"communications link\" to require a \nconnection between two points is reinforced by extrinsic evidence contemporary to the '710 \npatent's May 31, 2002 filing date.3 The Dictionary of Communications Technology (3rd Ed., 1998) \ndefines \"communication link\" as \"[t]he software and hardware , to include cables, connectors , \nconverters, etc., required for two devices such as a computer and terminal to communicate. \" See \nD.I. 89-1 at JA0409. The IBM Dictionary of Computing (10th ed., 1993) defines \"communication \nlink\" as synonymous with \"data link\", which is \"( 1) The assembly of parts of two data terminal \nequipment that are controlled by a link protocol, and the interconnecting data circuit, that enable \ndata to be transferred from a data source to a data sink ... [ and] (2) The interconnecting data circuit \nand the link protocol between two or more equipments . . . A data link includes the physical \nmedium of transmission, the protocol, and associated devices and programs -it is both logical and \nphysical.\" D.I. 89-1 at JA0420. \n3 See Sanofi-Aventis US. LLC v. Eli Lilly & Co., C.A. No. 14-113-RGA-MPT , 2015 WL \n1925920, at *1 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015) (\"The '652 patent has an effective filing date of June 18, \n2002, which is the relevant time period for purposes of claim construction.\"). \n14 These definitions comport with a declaration submitted by HMD's expert, who opines that \n\"[A] skilled artisan would have understood that the terms 'communication channel' and \n'communication link' are related, but distinct. A 'communication channel' would be understood \nto consist of the hardware connections between the encoder and decoder ( e.g., the structures \nforming the pipeline), and a 'communication link' would be understood to comprise the software \nand hardware between the encoder and decoder (e.g., to enable the handshake between the two).\" \nD.I. 90 1 33. While VoiceAge's expert opines that \"a POSITA would understand that each of \nthose examples in the '710 Patent, a wire, an optical link, a fiber link, or a radio frequency link \ncould be considered a communication link,\" D.I. 91 163, he does not opine that a skilled artisan \nwould limit communication link to those examples , as VoiceAge's construction does by confining \na \"communication link\" to a \"portion of the communications channel.\" \nAccordingly, the Court will construe \"communication link\" to be \"a connection between \ntwo devices over a communication channel. \"4 \n4 To maintain consistency with the Court's earlier construction of the \ntransmitting/transmission terms, supra at 6-11, the Court uses the word \"over\" instead of \"across\" \nin construing \"communication link.\" See Integrated Claims Sys., LLC v. Travelers Indem. Co., 758 \nF. App'x 965, 967 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (citing Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed. Cir. \n2005) (en bane); Gillespie v. Dywidag Systems Intern., USA, 501 F.3d 1285, 1291 (Fed.

The parties further dispute whether the terms \"frame classification \" and \n\"signal classification \" may be used interchangeably when referring to the claimed \nconcealment/recovery parameters . Id. at 53, 55-56 \nStarting with the claims, claim 4 recites that the \"signal classification parameter\" is one of \nthree concealment/recovery parameters determined in the encoder. See '710 patent at 31 :39-43 \n(\"determining, in the encoder, concealment/recovery parameters selected from the group \nconsisting of a signal classification parameter , an energy information parameter , and a phase \ninformation parameter related to the sound signal\"). Claim 4 further recites \"wherein: ... \ndetermining, in the encoder, concealment/recovery parameters comprises classifying successive \nframes of the encoded sound signal as unvoiced , unvoiced transition, voiced transition, voiced, or \nonset.\" Id. at 31 :49-54.). Claims 16 and 24 recite that \"the determiner of concealment/recovery \nparameters comprises a classifier of successive frames of the encoded sound signal as unvoiced , \n16 unvoiced transition , voiced transition , voiced, or onset.\" '710 patent at 36:9-12, 38:42-45. Thus, \nthe language of the claims suggests, as the parties agree, that the \"signal classification parameter\" \nis used to determine the frame classes later enumerated in the claim itself. The claims further \nsuggest, and the parties do not dispute, that that \"signal classification parameter\" and \"frame \nclasses\" are distinct from each other. See, e.g., '710 patent at cl. 16 (\"in the encoder, a determiner \nof concealment/recovery parameters selected from the group consisting of a signal classification \nparameter, an energy information parameter and a phase information parameter related to the \nsound signal; and ... wherein ... the determiner of concealment/recovery parameters comprises \na classifier of successive frames of the encoded sound signal as unvoiced , unvoiced transition, \nvoiced transition, voiced, or onset ... \"); Tr. 72:24-73:1 ; 74:3-9; 75:1-8. \nTurning to the specification, an illustrative embodiment described in Tables 2 and 3 draw \na distinction between \"Signal Classification Parameters \" and \"Frame Class[ es]\": \nTABLE2 \nSignal Cl<1SSification Piuameters and the coefficieuts \nof their re:.pe<.tive scaling fun.ctious \nParameter Meaning ~ \n~ Normali:zed Correlation 2.857 \ne, Spa.\"!nll Tilt 0.04167 \ns.nr Sip.ml ro Noise Ratio 0.1111 \npc Pitch Stability counter -0.07143 \nE, Rclllivt: Frame Energy 0.05 \nzc Zero Crossing C.Ounte.r -0.04 TABLE3 \nSignal ClllSSific_,ticn Rules nt the Ellcoder \nPn:-.liow; fruno ct ...

See '710 patent at 19:14-24 (\"The merit \nfunction has been defined as: \n17 where the superscript s indicates the scaled version of the parameters. The classification is then \ndone using the merit function and following the rules summarized in Table 3\"). Thus, the claims \nand specification favor a construction distinguishing between \"a signal classification parameter \" \nand a \"frame class.\" Indeed, the parties during the claim construction hearing agreed that \"a signal \nclassification parameter \" is a parameter used to determine frame classification that is different \nfrom frame classification . Tr. 72:24-73:1; 74:3-9; 75:1-8. \nHMD, however, proposes the Court go further by incorporating in its construction an \nexemplary list of signal classification parameters borrowed from Table 2. During prosecution , the \nexaminer understood \"signal classification parameter\" as not limited to HMD's exemplary \nparameters. See D.I. 89-2 at JA0701 (\"[The prior art] teaches a method and apparatus for hybrid \ncoding of speech, where a speech classifier/pitch/voicing (CPV) module 18 classifies speech as \nstationary unvoiced , steady-state voiced (harmonic ), or transition speech. Classification data 42, \npitch data 44, and voicing data 46 are sent to multiplexer 48 for transmission over data channel 56 \nto a decoder ... Thus, [the prior art] teaches at least 'a signal classification parameter ' .\").5 \nAccordingly , the Court declines to narrow \"signal classification parameter \" beyond explaining that \n\"frame classification\" and \"signal classification \" are different from each other. \nThe Court also declines VoiceAge ' s invitation to rely on an embodiment and define \"frame \nclassification \" and \"signal classification \" as \"interchangeabl[ e ]\" when referring to the \nconcealment/recovery parameters. D.I. 88 at 52; compare '710 patent at 12:13-20 (explaining that \nthe concealment/recovery parameters \"include two or more of the following : frame classification , \n5 The prior art reference upon which the examiner relied distinguished between parameters \nused to determine the signal classification and the signal classification itself. Compare JA0 194 at \n18:38-39 (\"a set of parameters as input features for the classification \"); with JA0195 at 19:4-6 (an \n\"output ...

Even if a \"frame\" or \"signal\" \nclassification served as a concealment/recovery parameter in one disclosed embodiment, \"every \nclaim does not need to cover every embodiment. \" Pacing Techs., LLC v. Garmin Int'!, Inc., 778 \nF.3d 1021, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (\"Just because an embodiment does not expressly disclose a \nfeature does not mean that embodiment excludes that feature\"). \nThus, consistent with the parties' agreement that \"a signal classification parameter \" is a \nparameter used to determine frame classification that is different from frame classification, Tr. \n72:24-73: 1; 74:3-9; 75: 1-8, the Court construes \"a signal classification parameter \" as \"a parameter \nused to determine frame classification that is different from the frame classification itself.\" \n4. \"classifier \" \nDisputed Term Plaintiff VoiceAge's Defendant HMD's The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \nMeans-plus-function \n(governed by \u00a7 112, ,r 6) \nFunction: classifying \nsuccessive frames of the \n\"classifier\" encoded sound signal as \nPlain and ordinary unvoiced , unvoiced device for making a \ntransition, voiced classification ('710 patent, meaning ( and not transition , voiced, or (not governed by \u00a7 112, claims 16, 18, governed by \u00a7 112, ,r 6) onset ,r 6) 19, 24) \nStructure: no \ncorresponding structure, \nmaterial, or acts \ndescribed in the \nspecification. Indefinite . \n19 VoiceAge argues that \"classifier\" should be afforded its plain and ordinary meaning which \nis a \"module\" that \"takes information about a sound signal and then classifies it according to some \nset of rules, and the output, then, is an information about that class or information that is used to \ndetermine that class.\" Tr. 76:18-21. HMD argues that \"classifier\" is a means-plus-function term \ngoverned by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, ,r 6. D.I. 88 at 63. \nMeans-plus-function claiming permits a patentee to express an element of a claim as a \nmeans for performing a specified function, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, ,r 6, and applies consistent with the \nfollowing analysis: \nThe means-plus-function analysis asks two questions. First: Is the disputed claim \nlimitation drafted in means-plus-function format? Second, if and only if the answer \nto the first question is ''yes\": What, if any, is the structure corresponding to the \nclaimed function? ... Because invoking \u00a7 112 ,r 6 is typically a choice left to the \nclaim drafter, we presume at the first step of the analysis that a claim limitation is \nsubject to \u00a7 112 ,r 6 when the claim language includes the term \"means.\" The \ninverse is also true-we presume that a claim limitation is not drafted in means\u00ad\nplus-function format in the absence of the term \"means\" We have made clear, \nhowever, that this presumption is rebuttable. The presumption can be overcome if \na challenger demonstrates that the claim term fails to recite sufficiently definite \nstructure. We have also held that nonce words that reflect nothing more than verbal \nconstructs may be used in a claim in a manner that is tantamount to using the word \n\"means,\" and can invoke \u00a7 112 ,r 6. We have emphasized that the essential inquiry \nis not merely the presence or absence of the word \"means,\" but whether the words \nof the claim are understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art to have a \nsufficiently definite meaning as the name for structure. What is important is ... \nthat the term, as the name for structure, has a reasonably well understood meaning \nin the art. \nDyfan, LLC v. Target Corp., 28 F.4th 1360, 1365, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted). \nHere, \"classifier\" appears in claims 16, 18, 19, and 24 and is not accompanied by the word \n\"means.\" For example, Claim 16 recites \"the determiner of concealment/recovery parameters \ncomprises a classifier of successive frames of the encoded sound signal as unvoiced , unvoiced \n20 transition, voiced transition , voiced, or onset.\" Indeed, during prosecution , the applicants amended \nthe claims to replace \"means for classifying \" language with a \"classifier. \" See D.I. 89 at JA0078-\n96. Accordingly , due to the absence of \"means\" in the claims, the Court presumes that\u00a7 11216 \ndoes not apply, a presumption that is HMD's burden to overcome. Dyfan, 28 F.4th at 1367. \nTo rebut this presumption , HMD relies upon the language of Claim 16 to argue that the \nterm itself is devoid of structure, Tr. 80: 16-17 (\"And I think that we have satisfied our burden in \nthat sense just by looking at the claim language. \"), notes that the specification does not use the \nterm \"classifier ,\" D.I. 88 at 73, and characterizes the prosecution history as \"dispositive, \" id. at 73; \nid. at 64 (\"Replacing the term 'means for classifying ' with the term 'a classifier ' does not connotate \nany more structure than the means element it replaced. \"). But these arguments do not permit the \nCourt to conclude that HMD has demonstrated , by a preponderance of the evidence, that a person \nof ordinary skill in the art would not have understood \"classifier \" to connote structure \"in light of \nthe claim as a whole.\" Apex Inc. v. Raritan Comput., Inc., 325 F.3d 1364, 1372-73 (Fed. Cir. \n2003).6 While HMD interprets the intrinsic record to favor means-plus-function claiming, the \nprior art cited on the face of the '710 patent contains examples of \"classifiers\" in the context of \nclassifying sound signals, suggesting that \"classifier \" had a structural definition generally known \nin the speech encoding art. See Dyfan, 28 F.4th at 1366 (\"Structure can be recited in various ways, \nincluding through the use of' a claim term with a structural definition that is either provided in the \nspecification or generally known in the art,' or a description of the claim limitation 's operation \nand 'how the function is achieved in the context of the invention. \"') (quoting Apple Inc. v. \n6 \"From a procedural standpoint , this presumption imposes on (the party challenging the \npresumption] the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut ... the presumption \" by showing \nthat a person of ordinary skill in the art \"believes the term does not recite sufficiently definite \nstructure.\" Apex, 325 F.3d at 1373. \n21 Motorola , Inc., 757 F.3d 1286, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2014)); see, e.g., D.I. 89 at JA0192 (U.S. Patent \nNo. 6,233,550 to Gersho, et al.) at 13:22-25, 33:23-25, 33:49-51, 34:8-10, 38:43-45) (suggesting \nthat \"speech classifier\" of U.S. Patent No. 6,233,550 classified sound signals as stationary \nunvoiced, steady-state voiced, or transition) . Thus, HMD's interpretation of the intrinsic record \ndoes not satisfy its evidentiary burden. \nTurning to the extrinsic record, HMD offers no expert testimony that a skilled artisan would \nnot have understood \"classifier\" to connote structure. While HMD cites to a contemporaneous \ndefinition of\"classifier\" , that definition (to the extent it is even relevant)7 suggests that \"classifier\" \nconnotes some structure. See D.I. 89-1 at JA0447 (IEEE: The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE \nStandards Terms, 7th ed., 2000) (\"classifier See: decision rule\"); D.I. 89-1 at JA0448 (\"decision \nrule A rule or algorithm used in pattern classification to assign an observed unit of image data to \na pattern class based on features extracted from the image. Synonym: classifier.\"). \nTherefore , \"[i]n the absence of any more compelling evidence of the understanding of one \nof ordinary skill in the art, the presumption that\u00a7 112, ,r 6 does not apply is determinative.\" Apex, \n325 F.3d at 1373; see also Zeroclick, LLC v. Apple Inc., 891 F.3d 1003, 1007-08 (Fed. Cir. 2018) \n(finding that \"the presumption against the application of\u00a7 112, ,r 6 to the disputed limitations \nremained unrebutted\" because challenger failed to carry its evidentiary burden); Personali zed \nMedia Commc 'ns, LLC v. Int'/ Trade Comm 'n, 161 F.3d 696, 702-04 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (stating that \n\"[w]hether certain claim language invokes 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, ,r 6 is an exercise in claim \nconstruction\" and that the presumption that \u00a7 112, ,r 6 does not apply \"can be rebutted if the \nevidence intrinsic to the patent and any relevant extrinsic evidence so warrant\"). Because HMD \n7 The cited definition appears to arise in the image processing context, not in the speech \nencoding art, rendering its applicability suspect. \n22 has not rebutted the presumption, the Court will apply the plain and ordinary meaning to \n\"classifier, \" which is a \"device for making a classification. \" \n5. \"switches\" \nPlaintifTVo iceAge's Defendant HMD's The Court's Disputed Term Construction Construction Construction \n\"switches\" devices for making and \nPlain and ordinary breaking the device or program for \n(' 4 7 5 patent, claims meaning connection in an making a selection \n1, 3, 9, 11) electric circuit \nThe parties dispute whether the plain and ordinary meaning of \"switches \" as understood \nby a person of ordinary skill in the art is directed to hardware and software ( as VoiceAge contends) \nor hardware alone (as HMD contends). Tr. 86:11-12; 93:2-3. \nStarting with the claim language , claim 1 recites \"switches\" that are in either a \"first \nposition\" or a \"second position\" to dictate the flow path of the signal: \nA Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) codebook coding device \nfor encoding sound into first, second, and third sets of encoding \nparameters, comprising: \na selector of an order of the CELP innovative codebook stage and \nthe transform-domain codebook stage ... wherein the selector \ncomprises switches having a first position where the CELP \ninnovative codebook stage is first and followed by the \ntransform -domain codebook stage and a second position \nwhere the transform-domain codebook stage is first and \nfollowed by the CELP innovative codebook stage, and \nwherein: \nm the first position of the switches, the second calculator \ndetermines the second target signal using the first target signal \nand information from the CELP adaptive codebook stage and \nthe third calculator determines the third target signal using the \nsecond target signal and information from the CELP \ninnovative codebook stage; and \nm the second position of the switches, the third calculator \ndetermines the third target signal using the first target signal \n23 and information from the CELP adaptive codebook stage and \nthe second calculator determines the second target signal using \nthe first target signal and information from the CELP adaptive \ncodebook stage and the transform-domain codebook stage, \n'475 patent at cl. 1 (emphasis added). HMD contends that by \"electing to use the term 'switches' \nwith 'discreet positions,' this is found in the claim itself, [VoiceAge] ha[s] narrowed the term to \n'hardware switches.\"' Tr. 92: 12-18 (\"They have used the word in a particular way that limits this \nto hardware by electing to use the term 'switch.\"'). But the claims do not use the term \"hardware \nswitches.\" Indeed, the claims are silent as to whether the claimed switching and related \npositionality occurs in software and hardware, or hardware alone. While HMD argues that \nVoiceAge has \"narrowed \" the term \"switches\" to hardware alone, HMD does not argue disavowal \nof claim scope. See Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2014) \n(\"We depart from the plain and ordinary meaning of claim terms based on the specification in only \ntwo instances: lexicography and disavowal.\"). Accordingly, the claim language does not favor \nHMD's position. \nTurning to the specification , which does not define the disputed term, \"switch\" is used \nwhen describing an embodiment without confining its implementation to hardware : \nThe output of the classifier 601 is used to drive a first switch 602 \nwhich determines if the second codebook stage after the adaptive \ncodebook stage is ACELP coding 604 or transform-domain (TD) \ncoding 605. Further, a second switch 603 also driven by the output \nof the classifier 601 determines if the second ACELP stage 604 is \nfollowed by a TD stage or if the second TD stage 605 is followed \nby an ACELP stage 607. Moreover, the classifier 601 may operate \nthe second switch 603 in relation to an active or inactive speech \nframe and a bit rate of the codec using the modified CELP model, \nso that no further stage follows the second ACELP stage 604 or \nsecond TD stage 605. \n24 '475 patent at 13:15-30. The embodiment is further described in Figure 6, representing a \"a \nschematic block diagram of an example of general, modified CELP coder with a classifier for \nchoosing between different codebook structures. \" '475 patent at 2:27. Specifically, Figure 6 \ndepicts how the described switches 602 and 603 occupy one of two positions using a diagram: \nTo argue that a person of ordinary skill in the art would interpret Figure 6 to represent an electrical \nswitch implemented in hardware , HMD and its expert rely on a document published by the U.S. \nNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) titled \"Typical Electrical Drawing Symbols and \nConventions\" that purports to symbolize a hardware switch using the same symbol used in \nswitches 602 and 603. D.I. 88 at 81. But the NRC document , as VoiceAge's expert explains, \n\"depict[s] symbols typically used in electrical circuit diagrams,\" not in the schematic block \ndiagram used in Figure 6. D.I. 91 ,r,r 41-47. According to VoiceAge's expert, \"A schematic block \ndiagram as used here would typically not depict electrical currents or electrical circuits like the \nNRC document. \" D.I. 91 ,r 43. As result, the Court cannot join HMD and interpret Figure 6 as \nconfining the claimed \"switches\" to hardware. \n25 Rather, the specification lends support to VoiceAge 's view that a \"switch\" or \"switches\" \nmay encompass both software and hardware. The '475 patent cites to U.S. Patent No. 6,134,518 \n(\"Cohen\"), '475 patent at (56), which is titled \"Digital Audio Signal Coding Using a CELP Coder \nand Transform Coder,\" D.I. 89-1 at JA0394. Cohen discloses a \"switch\" as item 140 in its Figure \n2: \n15 110 \n\\ \n130 \nTRANSFORM '------')(CODER I-----' \nruu 120 140 \nD.I. 89-1 at JA0396. In describing the switching functionality , Cohen discloses that, \"The \nselection decision is transferred from the classifier 130 to both coders 110 and 120 and to switch \ncircuit 140, in order to enable one coder and disable the other. The switching takes place at frame \nboundaries. Switch 140 transfers the selected coder output as output signal 150, and provides for \nsmooth transition upon switching. \" Id. at JA0401. Cohen further states that \"It will be understood \nthat the above described coding system may be implemented as either software or hardware or any \ncombination of the two.\" Id. at JA0404. Thus, the \"switch\" in Cohen contemplated both software \nand hardware functionality. Although HMD argues that Cohen's use of the term \"switch circuit\" \nis a \"nod to hardware ,\" D.I. 88 at 86, nowhere does Cohen confine \"switch\" or \"switch circuit\" to \nhardware. At a minimum , therefore, the specification suggests that a skilled artisan would not \nhave understood \"switch\" to exclude functionality in software. \n26 Turning to the extrinsic record, contemporaneous speech encoders and decoders and \naccompanying switching functionality appear to have been implemented in software. See D.I. 89-\n2 at JA0607 (Speech Coding Algorithms (2003) (describing how \"[a] speech coder is generally \nspecified as an algorithm, which is defined as a computational procedure that takes some input \nvalues to produce some output values.\")). VoiceAge 's expert buttresses the notion of software \nswitching functionality , opining that \"even if a part of a coder were hardware, it would be relatively \nunlikely that switches would be hardware .\" D.I. 91 ,r 58.8 While HMD argues that the claimed \npositionality of the \"switch\" cannot occur in software, D.I. 88 at 79 (\"Software simulations of a \nswitch cannot have first and second positions , as claimed.\"), that statement is bereft of any citation. \nIndeed, HMD's expert does not opine that the claimed positionality cannot occur in software. See \ngenerally D.I. 90. \nVoiceAge' s expert further explains that, because \"command line switches\" occur m \nprogramming language, \"switch\" may refer to \"a programmatic /software construct rather than a \npurely hardware based one.\" D.I. 91 ,r,r 48-54. Contemporaneous dictionaries confirm this view. \nWhile HMD cites dictionaries describing a \"switch\" as a hardware device, id. at 84, VoiceAge \n8 \"This is because ( as with Fig. 6 of the '4 7 5 Patent) the bulk of different types of coders \nare implemented in software. When a hardware piece is added to a software implementation, that \nrequires difficult translation from software to hardware. POSIT As would only make that \ntranslation if the effort was compensated for with a significant speed-up of the coder. But, software \nswitches are fast-they typically require on the order of ten or 100 clock cycles to perform. \nAccordingly , as 10 or 100 clock cycles is a very short amount of time, there would be very little \nadvantage to be obtained in converting a software switch to a hardware switch. For this additional \nreason, a POSIT A would expect switches in voice encoders at the time of the invention of the '4 7 5 \nPatent to be software switches, not hardware switches. At a minimum , a POSIT A would not expect \nswitches in voice encoders at the time of the invention of the '475 Patent to be solely implemented \nin hardware .\" D.I. 91 ,r 58. \n27 cites a dictionary defining \"switch\" as \"[a] device or programming technique for making a \nselection; for example, a toggle, a conditional jump.\" D.I. 88 at 76. \nIn sum, the intrinsic and extrinsic record suggests that a skilled artisan would have not \nunderstood \"switches \" in the context of the '475 patent to be limited to hardware . Even if the \nCourt were to agree with HMD that the instant dispute is one of \"poor claim drafting,\" Tr. 92:12-\n13, \"[i]t is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312. \nAccordingly , the Court construes \"switch\" according to its plain meaning, which is a \n\"device or program for making a selection. \" \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe Court will adopt the parties' agreed-upon constructions and construe the disputed \nclaim terms as described above. The Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum \nOpinion. \n28 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nVOICEAGE EVS LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nC.A.
