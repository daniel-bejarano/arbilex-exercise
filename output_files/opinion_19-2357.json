CONLEY,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ, No. 19-2357-LPS\nOFFICER STEARNE, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nBrian J. Conley, Howard R. Young Correctional Institution, Wilmington, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJune 13, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nfut P. des\n\nARK, U.S. Circuit Judge:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Brian J. Conley (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), an inmate at the Howard R. Young Correctional\nInstitution in Wilmington, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.' (D.I. 3)\nPlaintiff appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 6) The Court\nproceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nNamed Defendants are New Castle County Police Officer Stearne (\u201cStearne\u201d) and the New\nCastle County Police Department (NCCPD). Plaintiff alleges that on October 23, 2019, he had a\n2001 Ford Mustang convertible tagged, registered, and titled in his name at the Delaware Division of\nMotor Vehicles. Plaintiff alleges that the previous owner reported to Stearne that Plaintiff did not\npay him for the car. Plaintiff alleges that he did pay for the car and what should have been a civil\ncase turned into a criminal case.\n\nOn October 26, 2019, Stearne charged Plaintiff with three felony theft charges. On October\n27, 2019, Stearne had the vehicle towed from the apartment complex where Plaintiff lived. On\nOctober 28, 2019, Stearne returned to the complex and, as alleged by Plaintiff, slandered his name to\nother residents in the complex.\n\nOn November 13, 2019, all felony charges \u201cwere dropped.\u201d On November 14, 2019,\nStearne returned to the complex and, Plaintiff alleges, intimidated Plaintiff's friends to find out who\nhad keys to the vehicle and continued to slander Plaintiff, calling him a thief. On November 22,\n\n2019, the Court of Common Pleas in and for New Castle County discharged the case with no court\n\n' When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a\nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See\nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\ncosts, fines, or restitution. On the same day, Plaintiff's public defender, Julia Badson (\u201cBadson\u201d),\ncontacted Stearne about the return of Plaintiff's vehicle, and Stearne stated that he could not tell\nanyone where the car was until the case was discharged, but the court clerk had not yet updated the\ncase in the system.\n\nOn December 13, 2019, Badson notified Stearne that the case was officially discharged in\nthe system, and she asked about the whereabouts of the car. Plaintiff alleges that Stearne ignored\nher. After unanswered calls on December 13 and 18, 2019, Stearne advised Badson on December\n19, 2019 that the vehicle had been given to the previous owner. Plaintiff alleges that the car should\nnot have been towed or given to the previous owner because that individual has no legal right to it.\nPlaintiff alleges that the car is titled, registered, and owned by him, no restitution was ordered, and\nno civil suit was ever filed. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants stole his car and he wants it back.\n\nFor relief, Plaintiff seeks return of the car. In addition, if someone obtained a salvaged title\nfor the vehicle after October 27, 2019 (when it was towed), Plaintiff asks that criminal charges be\nbrought against the officer who assisted in this and the person who obtained the title, as well as\nreturn of the car. Finally, Plaintiff seeks $50,000 if the foregoing requests for relief are not possible.\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(\u20ac)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from\nsuch relief.\u201d Ball v. Famigho, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(\u20ac)(2) (\u00e9n forma\npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions). The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most\n\nfavorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Philips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally\nconstrued and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nAn action is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d Neitgke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1), a court\nmay dismiss a complaint as frivolous if it is \u201cbased on an indisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a\n\u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario. Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28; see also\nWilson v. Rackmill, 878 F.2d 772, 774 (3d Cir. 1989); Deutsch \u00bb. United States, 67 F.3d 1080, 1091-92 (3d\nCir. 1995) (holding frivolous a suit alleging that prison officials took an inmate\u2019s pen and refused to\ngive it back).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule\n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher \u00bb. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a\nplaintiff leave to amend his Complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson\nv. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bel/_AsL Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nUSS. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do\nmore than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a\n\ncause of action.\u201d Davis \u00bb. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to\nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Willams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306,\n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft \u00bb. Igbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).\nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See\nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect\nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly and Igbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency\nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the\nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume\ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See\nConnelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task\nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id\nIv. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff's taking of property and liability claims against Stearne are not cognizable under 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983. To the extent Plaintiff alleges a due process claim based on the deprivation of his\npersonal property, it is not actionable under \u00a7 1983 unless there is no adequate post deprivation\nremedy available. See Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 542 (1981), overruled on other grounds by 474 U.S.\n327 (1986)); Harris v. McMullen, 609 F. App\u2019x 704, 705 (3d Cir. 2015). Because Delaware provides an\nadequate remedy \u2014 filing a common law claim for conversion of property \u2014 Plaintiff cannot maintain\n\na cause of action pursuant to \u00a7 1983. See Harris, 609 F. App\u2019x at 705; see also Affordable Autos, Inc. v.\nDietert, 2016 WL 1169244 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 24, 2016); Stickney v. Goldstein, 2002 WL 31999358\n(Del. Ct. Com. Pl. Mar. 14, 2002).\n\nIn addition, the defamation/slander claims are not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See\n0g, Aleem-X v. Westcott, 347 F. App\u2019x 731 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing Patton \u00bb. Preybylski, 822 F.2d 697, 700\n(7 Cir. 1987) (\u201c[D]efamation is not a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of the due process\nclause.\u201d).\n\nAlso, the claim against the NCCPD fails. It is well established that municipal liability under\n\u00a7 1983 \u201cmay not be proven under the respondeat superior doctrine, but must be founded upon\nevidence that the government unit itself supported a violation of constitutional rights.\u201d B\u00e9elevicz v.\nDubinon, 915 F.2d 845, 850 (3d Cir. 1990) (citing Monell \u00bb. New York City Dep't of Soc. Servs. 436 U.S.\n658 (1978)). Consequently, a municipality may be liable under Section 1983 only where the\nconstitutional injury is alleged to have been caused by a municipal \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201ccustom.\u201d Monell, 436\nUS. at 694.\n\nWhile a government policy is established by a \u201cdecisionmaker possessing final authority,\u201d a\ncustom arises from a \u201ccourse of conduct. . . so permanent and well settled as to virtually constitute\nlaw.\u201d Andrews v. City of Philadephia, 895 F.2d 1469, 1480 (3d Cir. 1990) (citing Monell, 436 U.S. 658).\nAccordingly, a plaintiff seeking to recover from a municipality must (1) identify an allegedly\nunconstitutional policy or custom, (2) demonstrate that the municipality, through its deliberate and\nculpable conduct, was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the injury alleged; and (3) demonstrate a direct\ncausal link between the municipal action and the alleged deprivation of federal rights. See Board of the\nCty. Comm'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997). The Complaint does not allege any of the required\nelements. Moreover, absent any allegation that a custom or policy established by the NCCPD\n\ndirectly caused harm to Plaintiff, his \u00a7 1983 claim cannot stand.\nFinally, Plaintiff asks that criminal charges be brought against individuals involved in the\ntaking of his vehicle. The decision whether to prosecute, and what criminal charges to bring,\ngenerally rests with the prosecutor. See United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 124 (1979).\n\nPlaintiffs allegations fail to state claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, are legally frivolous, and will\nbe dismissed.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint as legally frivolous pursuant 28\n\nUS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@) and 1915A(b)(1). The Court finds amendment futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nv. : Civ. No. 19-2357-LPS\nOFFICER STEARNE, etal,\n\nDefendants.\n\nORDER\nAt Wilmington, this 13th day of June, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED as legally frivolous pursuant 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@ and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). Amendment is futile.\n\n2.
