Andrews", "date": "03-29-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nEmery K. Chaplin, \nPlaintiff; \nV. \nCoca Cola Beverages Northeast, \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 21-351-RGA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nEmery Kent Chaplin, Lexington, SC. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nA. Thompson Bayliss, Daniel J. McBride, Christopher Fitzpatrick Cannataro, ABRAMS & \nBAYLISS LLP, Wilmington, DE; \nAttorneys for Defendant. \nMarch 29, 2022 \n1 ANDREWS, U.S. i~ \nBefore me is Defendant 's motion to dismiss. (D.I. 10). Plaintiff Emery K. Chaplin filed \nthis trademark infringement lawsuit prose. (D.I. 2). I have considered the parties' briefing. \n(D.I. 11, 21, 24). For the following reasons, Defendant 's motion is GRANTED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Emery K. Chaplin alleges that Defendant Coca Cola Beverages Northeast \ninfringes the trademark \"Body Armour Nutrition .\" (D.I. 2 at 4). Coca Cola Beverages Northeast \nis a regional bottler that distributes the sports drink \"BODY ARMOR. \" (D.I. 11 at 1 ). As the \nbasis for jurisdiction , Plaintiff states that the following rights have been violated: \"1) Common \nLaw Trademark Infringement 2) False Designation of Origin and Unfair Competition 3) \nDeceptive and Unfair Trade Practices. \" (Id. at 3). Regarding venue, Plaintiff alleges, \"Coca \nCola Beverages Northeast is Headquartered in the County.\" (Id. at 4). In his statement of facts, \nPlaintiff alleges: \nDefendant has marketed, advertised and sold, and continues to market advertise and sell(] \nit[ s] services using the \"Mark\" though the Infringing \"bodyarmournutrition \" website as \nwell as major retail outlets throughout the United States and around the world. The \nDefendant's activities as alleged herein, have caused Body Armour Nutrition LLC, \nCalifornia to no longer be able to do business. These actions are due to the detriment of \nthe Defendant. Plaintiff has no control over The Mark due to the Defendant's actions and \nthe Plaintiffs valuable good will in respect to it[s] Mark is at the Mercy of the \nDefendant. Defendant 's use of the Mark as alleged herein, and marketing, advertising and \nsale of services using the Mark throughout the United States and around the world was \ndone without the knowledge, consent or permission of the Plaintiff and continues without \nthe consent or permission of the Plaintiff. Defendant has violated the trademark rights of \nthe Plaintiff under the California \"Common Law Copyright \" thereby giving rise to this \naction. \nDefendant's infringement of the Mark as alleged herein has caused, and will continue to \ncause the Plaintiff Body Armour Nutrition , California to suffer monetary damages and \nDefendant to gain revenues and profits in an amount unknown at this time. Any monetary \ndamages awarded to Plaintiff should be substantial. The Plaintiff is also entitled to \nattorney conference fees. \n2 (Id. at 6). \nII. LEGALSTANDARDS \nA. Motion to Dismiss \nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept all \nfactual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to plaintiff. \nSee Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds prose, his pleading \nis liberally construed and his complaint, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less \nstringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Id. A court may consider the \npleadings, public record, orders, exhibits attached to the complaint, and documents incorporated \ninto the complaint by reference . Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308,322 \n(2007). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations \nin the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court \nconcludes that those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. \nv. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 558 (2007). \n\"Though 'detailed factual allegations' are not required, a complaint must do more than \nsimply provide 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction.\"' Davis v. Abington Mem 'l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,241 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 550). I am \"not required to credit bald assertions or legal conclusions improperly \nalleged in the complaint.\" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198,216 (3d \nCir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed , however, \"for imperfect statement of the legal \ntheory supporting the claim asserted.\" Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014). \nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \"substantive \nplausibility.\" Id. at 347. That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. Ashcroft \n3 v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"A claim has facial plausibility when the [complainant \npleads factual content that] allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the [accused] is \nliable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context\u00ad\nspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common \nsense.\" Id. at 679. \nB. Common Law Trademark \nTo allege California common law trademark infringement, Chaplin must allege \"(1) \nownership interest in a mark, and (2) the likelihood of the infringing mark being confused with \nthe plaintiff's mark.\" Sebastian Brown Prods., LLC v. Muzooka, Inc., 143 F. Supp. 3d 1026, \n1038-39 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citing Wood v. Apodaca, 375 F.Supp.2d 942, 947-48 (N.D. Cal. \n2005)). \"An ownership interest is demonstrated through priority of use.\" Id. \"California \ncommon law ... provides that whosoever first adopts and uses a trade name, either within or \nwithout the state, is its original owner. This rule applies to trademarks as well as tradenames.\" \nKelley Blue Book v. Car-Smarts, Inc., 802 F. Supp. 278, 289 (C.D. Cal. 1992) ( citations omitted; \ncleaned up). \nIn his statement of facts, Chaplin mentions common law copyright. I take this to refer to \nhis common law trademark claims. Whatever common law copyright protection Chaplin might \nbe claiming is likely preempted by the Copyright Act of 1976. See Mention v. Gessel!, 714 F.2d \n87, 90 (9th Cir. 1983) (\"The Copyright Act of 1976 preempts common law copyright claims, \nunless the claims arose from 'undertakings commenced before January 1, 1978. \"' ( citing 17 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 301(b)(2))). Furthermore, and titles and short phrases cannot be copyrighted. Douglas \nv. Osteen, 317 F. App'x 97, 99 (3d Cir. 2009) (\"[W]ords and short phrases are excluded \nfrom copyright protection.\") . \n4 C. False Designation of Origin and Unfair Competition \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) provides: \nAny person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for \ngoods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination \nthereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false \nor misleading representation of fact, which--\n(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation , \nconnection , or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, \nsponsorship , or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another \nperson ... shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or \nis likely to be damaged by such act. \nTo establish a claim, \"the owner of an unregistered mark 'has the burden of ... proving the \nexistence of a protectable mark.\"' Parks LLC v. Tyson Foods, Inc, 863 F .3d 220, 226 (3d Cir. \n2017)(citingE.T. Browne Drug Co. v. CococareProd. , Inc., 538F.3d 185,191 (3dCir. 2008)). \nD. Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices \nAlthough unclear from the complaint , I assume Chaplin is referring to the California law \nprohibiting \"unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive , untrue \nor misleading advertising .\" Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nCoca Cola Beverages Northeast (\"CCBN\") argues that this action should be dismissed \nbecause Chaplin lacks standing, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and Chaplin has \nfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (D.I. 11). I find that Chaplin has failed \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted and will therefore grant CCBN' s motion to \ndismiss without prejudice. \nI will first address CCBN' s standing and jurisdictional arguments. CCBN argues, \n\"Plaintiff concedes that he has suffered no injury.\" (D.I. 11 at 4). I disagree. It is true that \nChaplin responded to the prompt, \"If you sustained injuries related to the events alleged above, \n5 describe them here,\" with \"NONE.\" (D.I. 2 at 7). As Chaplin explains in his answering brief, \n\"This case is not about bodily injury or physical harm but the unlawful use of my intellectual \nproperty.\" (D.I. 21 at 1 of2). Construing his complaint as a whole in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff, Chaplin has alleged trademark infringement, which constitutes an injury. He further \nalleges damages to the tune of one hundred million dollars. (D.I. 2 at 6-7). \nRegarding subject matter jurisdiction, Chaplin checked the \"federal question\" box in his \ncomplaint. (D.I. 2 at 3). Chaplin appears to be alleging violations of the federal Lanham Act, \nwhich would support federal question jurisdiction. Although I agree with CCBN that Chaplin \nhas failed to state a claim under the Lanham Act or the common law, Chaplin has alleged \ntrademark infringement and referenced provisions which, construed in the light most favorable to \nplaintiff, are likely references to the Lanham Act. \nCCBN also attacks diversity jurisdiction . Since I think there is likely federal question \njurisdiction, I do not need to address diversity jurisdiction. However, I think it likely that the \nCourt has diversity jurisdiction as well. Based on Chaplin's forms, he appears to live in South \nCarolina. The inference most favorable to Chaplin is that he is a citizen of South Carolina. The \ncomplaint alleges that CCBN is \"headquartered\" in Delaware. (D.I. 2 at 4). Construed most \nfavorably to the Chaplin, Chaplin has alleged that CCBN has a principal place of business, or is \nincorporated, in Delaware. I take judicial notice that a public record search of the Delaware \nDepartment of State's website reflects that CCBN is indeed incorporated in Delaware. See \nhttps://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx (type \"Coca Cola Beverages \nNortheast\" into the \"Entity Name\" field and click \"Search\"). Chaplin has alleged damages of \none hundred million dollars, which meets the amount in controversy requirement. Thus, the \nCourt likely has diversity jurisdiction in this case. \n6 If Chaplin chooses to amend his complaint , and chooses to rely upon diversity \njurisdiction, he will need to make the appropriate representations about which state he was a \ncitizen of at the time of the filing of the complaint. \nI agree with CCBN that Chaplin has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted. Each cause of action requires plaintiff to plead an ownership interest in the mark. \nWhile Chaplin attaches exhibits showing his use of the mark from at least 2005 to his answering \nbrief, I cannot consider evidence that is neither attached to the complaint nor integral to the \ncomplaint. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makar Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308,322 (2007). The \ncomplaint contains only conclusory assertions that defendant infringed the mark, and that this \ninfringement has caused \"Body Armour Nutrition LLC, California to no longer be able to do \nbusiness.\" (D.1. 2 at 6). There is no explanation of how Chaplin is associated with the California \ncompany Body Armour Nutrition LLC.1 Nor are there other facts showing that Chaplin himself \nhas an ownership interest in the mark. Similarly , the complaint fails to plead Chaplin's priority \nof use-there are no facts pled regarding the timeframe of both Chaplin 's and defendant's use of \nthe mark. \nFurther, Chaplin has failed to plead a likelihood of confusion. Chaplin does not allege \nany facts showing how or why a consumer would confuse CCBN's use of \"bodyarmomutrition\" \nwith Chaplin's mark. Although the marks \"Body Armour Nutrition\" and \"bodyarmomutrition \" \nare similar, the complaint alleges no details regarding plaintiffs use of the mark and only scant \nassertions that CCBN has \"marketed, advertised and sold\" its \"services\" using the mark. (D.I. 2 \nat 6). There are no facts that support the other likelihood of confusion factors, such as the \n1 Chaplin refers to Body Armour Nutrition as being \"Plaintiff' and the common law trademark as \nbeing \"its\" mark. (D.I. 2 at 6). If the mark belongs to someone other than Mr. Chaplin \nindividually , he probably has no basis to be a plaintiff in this lawsuit. \n7 strength of plaintiffs mark, any evidence of actual confusion, the proximity of the goods, \nplaintiffs and defendant's marketing channels, or the type of goods and the degree of care \nexercised by consumers when purchasing the goods. Kelley Blue Book v. Car-Smarts, Inc., 802 \nF. Supp. 278, 287 (C.D. Cal. 1992). \nRegarding Chaplin's claim of deceptive and unfair trade practices, Chaplin has not pied \nfacts showing CCBN's \"unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, \ndeceptive, untrue or misleading advertising .\" Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200. The complaint \ndoes not discuss any particular business acts or instances of deceptive advertising beyond a \ngeneral assertion that CCBN uses the \"bodyarmornutrition\" mark in advertising. (D.I. 2 at 6). \nThus, plaintiff has failed to state a claim for deceptive and unfair trade practices. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss (D.I. 10) is GRANTED . \nPlaintiff's complaint (D.I. 2) is dismissed without prejudice. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n8 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nEmery K. Chaplin, \nPlaintiff; \nV. \nCoca Cola Beverages Northeast , \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 21-351-RGA \nORDER \nFor the reasons stated in the accompanying memorandum opinion, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that Defendant 's motion to dismiss (D.I. 10) is GRANTED . Plaintiff's complaint \n(D.I. 2) is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE . \nEntered this 21 day of March, 2022. "}
