The Office of the United States \nTrustee (\u201cUST\u201d) has filed an amicus curiae  brief in support of reversal of the Fee  Order.  (D.I. \n15)  For the reasons that follow, the Court will affir m the Fee Order.  \nII. BACKGROUND \nA. The Chapter 11 Cases  \nOn October 12, 2020, Debtors  filed voluntary petitions seeking chapter 11 bankruptcy \nrelief.  (B.D.I. 1, 2)   Mallinckrodt\u2019s filing was precipitated by opioid- related and other litigation.  \n(App. 260, 1317- 19)  Three groups of creditors formed non- statutory ad hoc groups to negotiate \npossible settlements with Mallinckrodt: (1) the Governmental Plaintiff Ad Hoc Committee, representing states and U.S. territories holding opioid claims  (App. 261- 62); (2) the Unsecured \nNotes Ad Hoc Group, consisting of holders of Mallinckrodt\u2019s guaranteed unsecured notes  (App. \n261-62); and (3) the Multi -State Governmental Entities Grou p (\u201cMSGE Group\u201d), consisting of \nlocal governmental entities with opioid -related claims  (App. 262, 1339) .  \nPrior to filing its petition, Mallinckrodt entered into a restructuring support agreement \n(\u201cRSA\u201d) with the Governmental Plaintiff Ad Hoc Committee and  the Unsecured Notes Ad Hoc \nGroup.  The MSGE Group later joined the RSA .  (App. 262- 63; see also B.D.I. 505)   Among \nother things, the RSA  outlined the main terms for a proposed chapter 11 plan of reorganization. \n(App. 261- 62; s ee also App. 145- 79) \n The Governmental Plaintiff Ad Hoc Committee, the Unsecured Notes Ad Hoc Group, \nand the MSGE Group (collectively, the \u201c RSA  Parties \u201d) committed to either voting in favor of, or \nrecommending to their members that they vote in favor of, Debtors\u2019  proposed plan.  ( App. 263)  3 \n In turn, Debtors  agreed  to pay \u201call reasonable and documented fees and out -of-pocket expenses\u201d \nof certain professionals retained by the RSA Par ties, including attorneys, investment bankers, \nand financial advisors (\u201c RSA Professionals\u201d) and gave each RSA Party  the right to terminate the \nRSA  if Debtors failed to meet their obligations.   (App. 267- 74, 164, 178- 79; B.D.I . 505 at 4 ) \nB. The Initial Fee Motion  \n \nThe RSA required an order granting Debtors authority to pay the RSA Party professional \nfees be entered within 60 days of the petition date ( i.e., by December 11, 2020).  ( App. 164, \n1327, 1331)   On November 16, 2020, Debtors  moved for an order \u201cauthorizing but not directing \n[Debtors ] to pay the  reasonable and documented fees and expenses of the RSA Party \nProfessionals .\u201d  (App. 25 8-382) (\u201c Initial Fee Motion\u201d)   In the Initial Fee  Motion, Debtors sought \nauthority to perform their reimbursement obligations under \u00a7 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code  \u2013\nwhich allows a debtor -in-possession to use estate property outside of the ordinary course of \nbusiness , with court approval  \u2013 but did not seek authority to assume or enter into any \nreimbursement agreements.   (App. 274)   \nIn support of the Initial Fee Motion, Debtors filed a declaration from Randall Eisenberg, \na Managing Director at AlixPartners LLP, Debtors\u2019 restructuring consultant and financial \nadvisor.  ( App. 505- 621)  Eisenberg explained that, \u201c[a]bsent assurance of payment for the \nreasonable fees and expe nses arising from their professionals\u2019 engagement with the Debtors, the \ncoordinated approach taken by the RSA Parties to date could erode or be abandoned altogether,\u201d which could force Debtors \u201cto negotiate with numerous parties on a one -off basis or bring new \nadvisors up to speed, creating tremendous inefficiency.\u201d  ( App. 515)   In particular, Eisenberg \nwas concerned that the RSA Parties would abandon the RSA and their support for Debtors\u2019 reorganization without  assurances of payment.  ( App. 515- 16)  Eisenb erg declared that  the risk 4 \n of one or more parties abandoning the RSA was that \u201cthe trajectory of the Debtors\u2019 cases would \nbecome substantially more uncertain, the Debtors would likely spend substantially more time in bankruptcy (with correspondingly higher  restructuring costs), and the Debtors\u2019 employees, \nvendors, and customers could lose confidence in the Debtors, harming the Debtors\u2019 business and potentially reducing the value of the enterprise.\u201d  (App. 515- 16)  Eisenberg concluded that \u201closs \nof RSA Party  support would be detrimental not only to the Debtors, but to all creditors,\u201d and that \n\u201c[t]he cost of the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of the RSA Parties will in all likelihood be meaningfully less than the potential loss of value should the  RSA Parties abandon \ntheir coordinated engagement and support.\u201d  ( App. 516)  \nFour parties -in-interest filed objections  to the Initial Fee Motion : (i) the UST  (App. 383-\n99); (ii) the \u201cAd Hoc First Lien Term Lender Group ;\u201d (iii) the official committee of unse cured \ncreditors (\u201cUCC\u201d); and (iv) the official committee of opioid claimants (\u201cOCC\u201d).  The UST had proffered only one objection: in the UST\u2019s  view, \u00a7 503(b)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code was the \nexclusive means of reimbursing an unsecured creditor\u2019s professional fees and could only be applied retrospectively, after plan confirmation.  (App. 390- 95)  The Acthar Plaintiffs  \u2013 the only \nAppellant s befor e this Court  \u2013 filed no objection, but, at the hearing, the Acthar Plaintiffs  \nrepresented that they \u201cconcur [red]  and support [ed]\u201d the UST\u2019s  \u201cobjections.\u201d  (App. 694)  In \nreply, Debtors  argued that  their request fell outside the scope of \u00a7 503, and was properly made \nunder \u00a7 363(b) because the D ebtor s sought  prospective authority to pay expenses, as opposed to \na creditor seeking after -the-fact reimbursement.  ( App. 458- 59) \nOn December 7, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Initial Fee Motion. \n(App. 645- 26)  By the time of the hearing, the UCC and OCC had withdrawn their objections. \n(App. 698, 710)   Instead, c ounsel for both official committees expressed support for the relief 5 \n requested.  ( App. 698, 712- 13)  Although the UCC was \u201cnot on board with the RSA\u201d and had \n\u201cindicated [their] nonsupport for the RSA at every turn\u201d ( App. 695- 97), it nevertheless argued \nthat relief should \u201cbe granted as a valid exercise of the debtors\u2019 business judgment,\u201d because the \nRSA provides the \u201cforward momentum towards a solution that makes sense for [its] constituency\u201d and because of a desire not \u201cto see th[e] [RSA] parties veer off at the first exit from what might be a viable path tow ards a more global resolution.\u201d  ( App. 696- 98)  The OCC \nsimilarly asserted  that \u201cthe case is better off with organized and important groups that have \nprofessionals and clients who feel comfortable that their professionals are getting paid on a current basi s\u201d and that \u201chaving these groups and professionals is the way Chapter 11 works; it \nmakes [the OCC\u2019s] job easier, it makes [the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s] job easier.\u201d  ( App. 712 ) \nIn a December 14, 2020 bench ruling, the Bankruptcy Court denied the Initial Fee Mot ion \nwithout prejudice.  ( App. 727- 66, 883- 85)  The Bankruptcy Court recognized that \u201cSection 363 \nprovides the procedural mechanism for a debtor to seek the authority to make payments to \nunsecured creditor groups\u201d  (App. 761) and agreed that \u201c[t]he ability to work with the ad hoc \ngroup[s] of creditors rather than trying to negotiate with vast numbers of individual creditors clearly provides for a more streamlined and convenient way to move toward completing a successful reorganizat ion.\u201d  ( App. 756)   The Bankruptcy C ourt also emphasized that \u201cpayments \ncould only be made for work that benefited the estate as a whole, not individual creditors,\u201d and that this standard was \u201cnot inconsistent with the rulings\u201d in the \u00a7 363(b) precedent Debtors had cited.  ( App. 761- 63)  Applying that precedent, the Bankruptcy C ourt noted safeguards were \nneeded to ensure that any reimbursements would be in the best interest of the estate.  ( App. 762-\n63, 765)  But because \u201cthe debtors have chosen not to seek to assume the RSA or the reimbursement agreements,\u201d the Bankruptcy Court could not \u201cdetermine whether it would be an 6 \n exercise of the debtor\u2019s business judgment to enter into those agreements ,\u201d and could not \n\u201cevaluate whether making payments pursuant to the  terms of those agreements would, in fact, be \nin the best interest of the estates.\u201d   (App. 764- 65)  In denying Debtors\u2019 motion without prejudice, \nhowever, the Bankruptcy C ourt left the door open for a renewed motion seeking to assume the \nexisting, or enter  into new, reimbursement agreements.  ( App. 765)  (denying Debtors\u2019 Initial Fee \nMotion \u201cwithout prejudice to [their] ability to seek to assume the RSA  or the reimbursement \nagreements or some other post -petition reimbursement agreement entered into with the ad hoc \ngroups\u201d or to c reditor groups\u2019 ability to seek reimbursement under \u00a7 503(b) . \nC. Second  Fee Motion  \n \nOn December  30, 2020, Debtors  filed  a Motio n to Assume  and/ or Enter  into \nReimbursement  Agreements  with RSA Party  Professionals .  (App. 767- 882) (\u201cSecond  Fee \nMotion\u201d)   Consistent  with  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s  prior  ruling, Debtors  sought  to pay the RSA  \nParty  professionals  by (i)  assuming the  pre-petition  reimbursement  agreements  under  \u00a7 365(a)  of \nthe Bankruptcy Code, and  (ii) entering  into post -petition  reimbursement  agreements  under   \n\u00a7 363(b)  with  the RSA  Parties  with  which  they  had not  executed  pre-petition  agreements.   (Id.; \nApp. 895- 96)  The  propos ed order  also contained  additional  limitations  on the scope  of \npermissible  reimbursements , including:  (i) requiring that  any reimbursable  expenses  be \nreasonable,  documented, and reimbursable  under  the applicable reimbursement  agreement;   \n(ii) excluding reimbursement  of fees incurred  by an individual  ad hoc group member  for \nprofessionals  retained  by that member  (including internal  counsel);  (iii) excluding \nreimbursement  of fees and expenses  of an individual  ad hoc group member  for filing  objections  \nto other  creditors\u2019  claims  or advancing or  prosecuting the  member\u2019s  own  claim;  (iv) excluding \nreimbursement  of fees and expenses  incurred  outside  the scope  of the reimbursement  agreements  7 \n or in connection with  litigation  against  Debtors;  and (v) requiring reimbursement  be subject  to \nthe interim compensation order.   (App. 793- 94, 798- 804, 1526- 33)  The  reimbursement  \nagreements  were all  included as  exhibits  to the Second  Fee Motion.  ( App. 805-67, 868- 81)  In \nfurther support  of the Second Fee  Motion, Debtors  submitted  another  Eisenberg  declaration,  in \nwhich  he reiterat ed and expanded  on his  prior  testimony.  (App. 893- 982)   \nActhar  Plaintiffs  filed  an objection (App. 1002- 1114)  and joined the  objection filed  by \nthe UST  (which  again  rested  on the  argument  that \u00a7 503(b)(4)  is the exclusive  means  of \nreimbursing an  unsecured  creditor\u2019s  professional  fees).  (App. 1002- 1114, 383-99)  The  Ad Hoc \nFirst Lien  Term  Lender  Group renewed  their  objections, which  Acthar  Plaintiffs  did not  join or \nprosecute.   (App. 1115- 38)  The  UCC  and OCC  ultimately  supported Debtors\u2019  Second  Fee \nMotion, after  accommodations  were made to  limit  the scope  of reimbursement  to ensure  benefit  \nto the estate, consistent  with the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s  prior  ruling.  ( App. 1387- 89, 1390- 99) \nOn January  14, 2021, the  Bankruptcy Court  held  a hearing  on the  Second  Fee Motion. \n(App. 1305- 1443)   Eisenberg  testified  and was cross -examin ed.  (App. 1312- 55)  He reiterated  \nhis concern  that, absent  assurances  of payment, the  RSA  Parties  could abandon the  RSA  and \ntheir support  for the  reorganization.  (App. 1324- 31)  Eisenberg  emphasized  the importance  of \norganized  ad hoc groups  in \u201cgarner[ing]  the support  of the necessary\u201d constituencies.   (Ap p. \n1319- 22, 1325)   He made clear  that the denial  of the Initial Fee  Motion had,  as feared,  stalled  the \nprogress  of the cases,  explaining that  \u201cwe have come to  a near  halt in terms  of the next  . . . very  \nmost  important  phase  of this case which  is the allocation  of opioid settlement proceeds.\u201d  ( App. \n1327)   In response  to questioning by counsel  for Acthar  Plaintiffs , Eisenberg  explained  that,  after  \nthe previous  fee motion  was denied, \u201cdebtors  have not  been  able to  make progress.   The  plan  had 8 \n been  to start  the mediation  immediately  after  that hearing  and all of that has been  on hold \npending resolution of  the professional  fees going forward.\u201d   (App. 1348)  \nD. Bench Ruling and Fee Order  \n \nIn a January 19, 2021 bench ruling, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Second Fee \nMotion, with two modifications.  ( App. 1444- 58)  The Bankruptcy C ourt found that Debtors had \n\u201cmet their burden of establishing the sound exercise of their business judgment under Sections \n363 and 365 in assuming and/or entering into the reimbursement agreements with the professionals of the ad hoc groups at issue.\u201d  (App. 1453- 54) \nThe Bankruptcy Court also held that the motion and proposed order \u201ccomplies with [ the \nCourt\u2019s ] previous ruling regarding what would be required for reimbursements . . . in that it \nassures that the reimbursements will be for work that benefits t he debtors\u2019 estates as a whole, \nrather than individual creditors or creditor groups ,\u201d and \u201censures that only reasonable and \nnecessary fees will be paid.\u201d  ( App. 1454)  In particular, the Bankruptcy C ourt found that \u201cgood \nfaith participation of the ad hoc groups in the mediation process is, in and of itself, beneficial to the debtors\u2019 estates as a whole,\u201d given \u201cthe unique nature of these cases, not just because of their size and complexity, but also because of the serious public health interests being addre ssed by \nthis bankruptcy.\u201d  ( App. 1455)  Consistent with Eisenberg\u2019s unrebutted testimony ( App. 1324-\n31), the Bankruptcy C ourt credited \u201cDebtors[\u2019] concern[s], based on the comments and actions \nby the ad hoc groups, that they will not actively participate i n the mediation if they cannot be  \nreimbursed for the costs associated with that effort.\u201d  ( App. 1455)  \nIn approving the Second Fee Motion, the Bankruptcy Court imposed two additional \nrequirements to further ensure that any reimbursements benefit the estate as a whole.  \u201cFirst, if \nthe mediator informs the Court that the mediation has failed and there are no further prospects 9 \n for proceeding with mediation, reimbursement of all fees and costs will cease, pending further \norder of the Court ;\u201d and \u201c[s]econd, if the mediator advises the Court that one or more of the ad \nhoc groups being reimbursed under this order are not acting in good faith in connection with the negotiations, then all reimbursements to those identified parties will cease immediately pending furthe r order of the Court, and any fees and expenses already paid will be subject to \ndisgorgement following a hearing and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d  (App. 1455- 56, 1495)  On \nFebruary 9, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Fee Order .  (App. 1491- 98) \nE. Appeal of the Fee Order \nActhar Plaintiffs  timely appealed  the Fee Order.  (D.I. 1)  Acthar Plaintiffs  did not seek a \nstay pending appeal or otherwise attempt to prevent reimbursement payments from being made while the appeal was pending.  Debtors have accordingly paid millions of dollars to the RSA Party professionals under the terms of the Fee Order and t he reimbursement agreements .  (App. \n1499- 1514)   On March 10, 2021, Debtors and the RSA Parties amended the RSA to, among \nother things, (i) add as parties the Ad Hoc First Lien Term Lender Group (which had objected to entry of the Fee Order) and settle all outstanding issues with them  (B.D.I. 1631- 1); and  \n(ii) eliminate the threat of termination due to delay in entry of the Fee Order  (id. at 12 -13).  The \ncurrent RSA instead allows for termination if \u201cthe RSA Parties Fee Order is reversed, stayed, or modified, on appeal or otherwise.\u201d  (Id. at 13 )  Mediation with the opioid claimants began \nshortly after the Fee Order was entered.  On April 20, 2021, Debtors filed a  proposed plan .  \n(B.D.I. 2074)   The plan , as amended  (B.D.I. 6510) , was confirmed on March 2, 2022.  (B.D.I. \n6660)  \nThe merits of the appeal are fully briefed.  (D.I.  12, 15, 16, 17, 20)  No party requested \noral argument .  The Court did not hear oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are 10 \n adequately presented in the briefs and record and the decisional process would not be \nsignificantly aided by oral argument. III. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n   Appeals fr om the Bankruptcy Court to this Court are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158.  \nPursuant to \u00a7 158(a), district courts have mandatory jurisdiction to hear appeals \u201cfrom final judgments, orders, and decrees .\u201d \n\u201c[W]ith respect to Section 363(b) motions . . . , the bankruptcy court has considerable \ndiscretion\u201d and \u201cmay only be overturned on appeal if its decision was an abuse of discretion.\u201d  In \nre Montgomery Ward Holding Corp., 242 B.R. 147, 152- 53 (D. Del. 1999).  A bankruptcy \ncourt\u2019s determination under \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) or 365(a) that a debtor has satisfied the business judgment test by \u201carticulat[ing] a reasonable basis for the business decision,\u201d in view of whether the transaction \u201cis in the best interests of the estate,\u201d is a factual finding reviewed for \u201cclear[] err[or]. \u201d  In re Culp, 545 B.R. 827, 844 (D. Del. 2016) (\u00a7 363(b)), aff\u2019d , 681 F. App\u2019x 140 (3d \nCir. 2017); see also In re Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 348 B.R. 136, 162 (D. Del. 2006)  \n(\u00a7 365(a)); In re Patterson , 119 B.R. 59, 60 (E.D. Pa. 1990) (same).  Under the clear error \nstandard, \u201c[a] bankruptcy court\u2019s \u2018ultimate determination of fact\u2019 will not be set aside unless \u2018that determination is completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility or bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.\u2019\u201d  In re Culp, 545 B.R. at 837 (citation omitted).  O n \u201cquestions of law,\u201d the reviewing court \u201cexercises plenary \nreview.\u201d  Id. \nIV.   DISCUSSION  \n The Bankruptcy Court entered the Fee Order pursuant to Sections 363(b) and 365(a) , \nwhich permits approval of professional fees on a prospective basis .  On appeal, the principal 11 \n basis on which the Acthar Plaintiffs  and the US T challenge the Fee Order is an argument based \non \u00a7 503(b) , and the canon of construction that t he \u201cspecific controls the general .\u201d  Section  \n503(b) , however, addresses creditor requests to pay professional fees on a retrospective basis.  \nSection 503(b) is located in a different chapter of the Bankruptcy Code  than Sections 363(b) and \n365(a); it applies to different parties in different circumstances, and serves a different purpose , \nthan the provisions that authorized the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s action.  None of the  cases  on which \nthe Acthar Plaintiffs  or the UST  rely involves \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) or 365(a), and none compels the relief \nthey seek  here.  \nThe UST does not dispute that \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a) apply to the Debtors\u2019 request ; nor \ndoes the UST contest the applicable busine ss judgment standard or argue it is not met here.  \nActhar Plaintiffs  similarly make no arguments about the applicability of \u00a7 363(b).  While Acthar \nPlaintiffs  argue that \u00a7 365(a) does not apply \u2013 because the pre- petition reimbursement \nagreements are not sufficiently \u201cexecutory\u201d  \u2013 Acthar Plaintiffs  did not raise this argument below . \nA. Approval  of the F ee O rder P ursuant  to \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and  365(a) I s Proper  \n \n1. Sections 363(b) and 365(a) Apply and Are Satisfied  \nThe Bankruptcy Court approved the relief set forth in the Fee Order pursuant to Sections  \n363(b) and 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Under \u00a7 363(b), a debtor -in-possession or \u201ctrustee, \nafter notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease, other than in the ordinary course of business, \nproperty of the e state.\u201d  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b); see also id. \u00a7 1107 (debtor -in-possession has  rights \nand powers of trustee).  Under \u00a7 365(a), the debtor, \u201csubject to the court\u2019s approval, may assume \nor reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 365(a).  Debtors filed a motion under \u00a7 363(b) seeking court approval (\u201cafter notice and a hearing\u201d) to \u201cuse\u201d \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d ( i.e., cash) to enter into post -petition reimbursement agreements with some of the 12 \n RSA Parties , to pay certain professiona l fees and expenses that benefited the estate.  Debtors \nsimilarly moved under \u00a7 365(a) , seeking \u201ccourt[] approval\u201d to \u201cassume\u201d pre -petition \nreimbursement agreements with other RSA Parties ( i.e., \u201cexecutory contract[s]\u201d) to pay the \nsame.  The Bankruptcy Court thus correctly held that \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a) provide the \u201cright \n\u2018procedural mechanism[s]\u2019\u201d through which Debtors may seek to pay the RSA Party professional fees and expenses on a prospective basis.  ( App. 761, 1453- 54) \nAs the Debtors correctly point out, other courts have reached the same conclusion .  See In \nre Bethlehem Steel Corp. , 2003 WL 21738964, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 2003) (affirming \nreimbursement under \u00a7 363(b) of creditor\u2019s professional fees \u201cto help evaluate and negotiate the terms of a plan\u201d); App. 2214- 20 (Order, In re Purdue Pharma, L.P., No. 19- 23649 (RDD) \n(Bankr.

Culp, 545 B.R. at 844; see also In re Fed. Mogul \nGlob., Inc., 293 B.R. 124, 126 (D. Del. 2003) (business judgment test applies to \u201cdebtor\u2019s use of assets outside the ordinary course of business ,\u201d including \u201cdebtor\u2019s decision to [assume or] reject \na contract\u201d)  (citation omitted).  The test considers the benefit to the debtor\u2019s estate and, \u201c[i]f a \nvalid business justification exists, then a strong presumption follows that the agreement was negotiated in good faith and is in the best interests of the estate.\u201d   Culp, 545 B.R. at 844.  Indeed, \n\u201c[w]here the [debtor -in-possession] articulates a reasonable basis for the business decision, \ncourts will generally not entertain objections.\u201d  Id.; see also  Armstrong , 348 B.R. at 162 (courts \n\u201cuniformly defer[] to the\u201d debtor under \u00a7 365(a)); In re Trans World Airlines, Inc., 261 B.R. 103, 121 (Bankr. D. Del. 2001) (\u201cA debtor\u2019s decision to reject an executory contract must be summarily affirmed unless it is the product of \u2018bad faith, or whim or caprice.\u2019\u201d ) (citation \nomitted).  \nApplying this  standard, the Bankruptcy Court \u201cconclude[d] that the debtors have met \ntheir burden of establishing the sound exercise of their business judgment under Sections 363 and 365 in assuming and/or entering into the reimbursement agreements with the professionals of the ad hoc  groups at issue.\u201d  ( App. 1453 -54)  The Bankruptcy C ourt specifically \u201cdetermined \nthat the relief requested in the Motion is in the best interests of the Debtors, their estates, their creditors, and other parties in interest.\u201d  ( App. 1492)  The Bankruptcy Court further credit ed \n\u201cDebtors[\u2019] concern[s], based on the comments and actions by the ad hoc groups, that they will not actively participate in the mediation if they cannot be reimbursed for the costs associated with that effort,\u201d and found that the moti on and proposed order \u201ccomplies with . . . \nrequire[ments] for reimbursements . . . in that it assures that the reimbursements will be for work that benefits the debtors\u2019 estates as a whole, rather than individual creditors or creditor groups\u201d 14 \n and \u201censures that only reasonable and necessary fees will be paid.\u201d  (App. 1454)  \nThe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous.  See Culp , 545 B.R. at \n844.  Here, the Debtors submitted ample evidence that, without approval of the payments, ad hoc \ngroups could have disbanded and the RSA Party professionals might have declined to actively participate in mediation regarding allocation of the fixed pool of opioid settlement  consideration \namong governmental and private opioid claimants, a critical gating item for prosecuting the plan contemplated by the RSA.  ( App. 515, 1325- 27)  The Bankruptcy Court recognized that Debtors\u2019 \ncontinuing engagement and cooperation with the RSA Parties would be essential to a successful restructuring.  ( App. 756, 1455)   The record reflects that Debtors\u2019 negotiations led to an RSA \nreflecting support from attorneys general for 50 (out of 56) U.S. states and territories (representing more than 95% of the national population), more than 1,300 municipalities, tribes, and other public opioid claimants, and over 84% of the Debtors\u2019 fulcrum -funded debt securities.  \n(App. 510- 11, 903)   Piecemeal negotiation with thousands of states, municipalities, bondhol ders \nand others  \u2013 rather than with three organized ad hoc groups represented by experienced advisors  \n\u2013 was not a feasible option.  T he UCC and OCC  acknowledged the value of the organized ad hoc \ngroups represented by the RSA Party professionals and supporte d the business justification for \npaying their fees.  ( App. 695- 98, 712)   Based on the  record , the Court finds no clear error  in the \nBankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that the relief was a sound exercise of the Debtors\u2019 business judgment . \n2. The Prepetition Reimbursement Agreements Are Executory  \n \nNeither the Acthar Plaintiffs nor the UST  advance any argument that \u00a7 363(b) does not \napply by its own terms.  The UST also makes no argument as to how \u00a7 365(a) could be deemed facially inapplicable.  Nor does the UST  argue that the Bankruptcy Court applied the wrong 15 \n standard under those provisions or that it misapplied the standard to the facts of this case.  ( See \nD.I. 15 at  21) (recognizing \u201clenient busi ness-judgment rule [is] typically applied to section 363 \nand 365 motions\u201d)  The Acthar Plaintiffs alone argue that \u00a7 365(a) does not apply because the \npre-petition reimbursement agreements are not \u201cexecutory.\u201d   They also appear to suggest the \nBankruptcy Court misapplied the governing standard.  The  Court does not agree.  \nActhar Plaintiffs contend that the reimbursement agreements are not \u201cexecutory \ncontracts\u201d and , therefore,  cannot be assumed under \u00a7 365(a).  (D.I. 12 at  18-27)  Acthar Plaintiffs \ndid not  raise this issue below .  Acthar Plaintiffs  did not file objections to the Initial Fee Motion \nand, while they purported to \u201cconcur and support\u201d the UST\u2019s  objections during the hearing, the \nUST  had not made any argument about the \u201ce xecutory\u201d nature of the agreements.  ( App. 694; see \nalso App. 383- 99)  Wh ile the Acthar Plaintiffs filed extensive objections to the Second Fee \nMotion, they  never raised an  issue  as to whether  the relevant agreements were executory.  (App. \n1002- 14)  Acthar  Plaintiffs  purported to support the UST\u2019s  objections  to the Second Fee Motion, \nbut again the UST  did not raise this issue as to the Second Fee Motion either.  ( App. 983- 1001)   \nOnly the First Lien Term Lender Group objector pressed the \u201cexecutory\u201d issue, b ut Acthar \nPlaintiffs never purported to join, or otherwise prosecute, that group\u2019s  objection.  ( See App. \n1115- 38)  Because the Acthar Plaintiffs did not press the \u201cexecutoriness\u201d issue below, it should \nnot be considered by this Court in the first instance.  See In re Kaiser Grp. Int\u2019l Inc., 399 F.3d 558, 565 (3d Cir. 2005) (\u201c [T]he general rule that when a party fails to raise an issue in the \nbankruptcy court, the issue is waived and may not be considered by the district court on appeal .\u201d). \nIn any event, the pre- petition reimbursement agreements are \u201cexecutory\u201d within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 365(a).  \u201cAn executory contract is a contract under which the obligation of both the 16 \n bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far underperformed that the failure of either to \ncomplete performance would constitute a material breach excusing the performance of the other.\u201d  In re Exide Techs. , 607 F.3d 957, 962 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).  Put another way, \nthe question is whether \u201cobligation[s] . . . go to the very root of the parties\u2019 Agreement.\u201d  Id. at 964.  \u201c Courts have ruled that contingent obligations under a contract ar e sufficient to render a \ncontract executory when the contingent obligations are essential to the contract.\u201d  In re Safety -\nKleen Corp., 410 B.R. 164, 166- 68 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009) (agreement to indemnify damages \narising from pre -and-post-closing environmenta l matters was executory); In re Philip Servs. \n(Delaware), Inc. , 284 B.R. 541, 550 (Bankr. D. Del. 2002) (similar), aff\u2019d , 303 B.R. 574 (D. Del. \n2003).    \nThat standard  is satisfied here.  T he Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 argument applies only to \nassumption of the pr e-petition  reimbursement agreements  \u2013 and in each of those agreements, \nboth parties have ongoing duties of performance during the pendency of the bankruptcy.  The \nRSA Party professionals committed to work on behalf of their clients , to negotiate and \nimplement a restructuring, and Debtors agreed to pay the professionals\u2019  reasonable and \ndocumented fees and expenses for doing so.  If the RSA Party professionals continue to provide \nthe services contemplated by those agreements, Debtors m ust compensate them.   If the RSA \nParty professionals were to stop performing, Debtors would be relieved of their compensation obligations (and vice versa).  \nThat the RSA Party professionals\u2019 obligations are framed in terms of the scope of \npayment does not c hange the analysis.  A s the Debtors correctly argue, a  contract is no less \nexecutory because one party can decide the extent to which it will exercise its contract rights.  See, e.g., In re Kellstrom Indus., Inc., 286 B.R. 833, 835 (Bankr. D. Del. 2002) (r ight of first 17 \n refusal was executory because debtor was obligated \u201cto sell to [the other contract party] if it \nmatches the offer ,\u201d and other party was \u201crequired to exercise or waive the right\u201d) .  At a \nminimum, such agreements are executory where (as here) \u201cthe [party with an option to perform] has announced that he is exercising the option, but [has] not yet followed through\u201d in full.  In re Robert L. Helms Constr. & Dev. Co., 139 F.3d 702, 706 (9th Cir. 1998). \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u201cDebtors a lready have the benefit they sought\u201d  (D.I. \n12) ignores the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding that the reimbursement agreements will provide ongoing benefits to the estate, including ensuring the RSA Party professionals\u2019 support in mediation and in the negotiation of numerous documents necessary to implement the restructuring.  T he Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 heavy reliance on In re Columbia Gas System , 50 F.3d at \n236-37, 243- 44, is misplaced for similar reasons.  ( See D.I. 12 at 20- 22)  That case concerned \nsettlement agreements whereby \u201cclass members were entitled to receive their share of . . . escrow monies only after they executed a release of claims and a supplemental contract,\u201d which the \ncourt determined were \u201cfunctionally ministerial du ties\u201d that \u201cwould [provide] nothing of value.\u201d  \n50 F.3d at 236- 37, 243- 44.  Here, the remaining \u201cobligation[s] . . . go to the very root of the \nparties\u2019 [a]greement[s],\u201d In re Exide Techs. , 607 F.3d at 964, and, as the Bankruptcy Court \nfound, assumption of  these agreements will benefit the estate.  \n3.  The Business Judgment Standard Is Satisfied  \nActhar  Plaintiffs assert  that Debtors failed to satisfy the business judgment rule.  (D.I. 12 \nat 37 -38)  Acthar Plaintiffs  describe Debtors\u2019 concerns regarding a \u201clo ss of \u2018momentum\u2019\u201d as a \n\u201cprophecy,\u201d and suggest that it was \u201cpoor business judgment\u201d to agree to pay the RSA Party professional fees when they already had to pay \u201cthe official committees\u2019 professional fees ,\u201d \nespecially because the RSA Party professionals ca n \u201cterminate\u201d the RSA for \u201cDebtors having 18 \n missed the December 2020 deadline.\u201d  Again the Court disagrees.  \nAs the Debtor correctly points out, t he official committees and ad hoc groups play very \ndifferent roles in these cases.   The official committees broadly advocate for the interests of the \ncreditor constituencies they represent but, unlike the ad hoc groups, do not have authority to vote \nclaims.  The  official committees  also are not (and do not include among their membership)  \ngovernmental entities that can help broker broader consensus among other similarly situated public entities.  Moreover , the RSA was amended in March 2021 to remove the December 2020 \nfee order milestone, such that the RSA Parties cannot  terminate the RSA f or failure to have met \nthat deadline.  (B. D.I. 1631- 1, at 12- 13)  The Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that the failure to pay such \nfees would have no adverse impact on the need to maintain forward momentum  is unsupported, \nand Debtors submitted  evidence to the co ntrary.  (App. 515- 16, 1325- 27)  The RSA Parties \nagreed that the reimbursement agreements were critical  (App. 435- 48, 498- 501, 622- 26, 1249-\n70), and s o did both official committees  (App. 696 -98, 711- 12).  The Bankruptcy Court made \nfactual findings that the  business judgment standard was satisfied.  ( App. 1453- 54, 1492, 1454-\n55)  T he Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 unexplained disagreement with those findings falls far short of \nestablishing clear error.   See Patterson , 119 B.R. at 60. \nB. Section 503(b) Does Not Apply or Otherwise Override \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) or 365(a)  \n \nThe only argument advanced by the UST  as amicus  (and one of many arguments pressed \nby Achtar Plaintiffs on appeal) i s based on \u00a7 503(b) , and consists of  two parts .  (See D.I. 15 at \n10-27)  First,  \u00a7 503(b)(4) addresses the payment of fees and expenses for professional services \nprovided to a creditor and, therefore, the argument goes, \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a)  cannot do the \nsame \u2013 despite their plain language.  Second, b ecause \u00a7 503(b)(3)(D)\u2019s \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d \ntest is retrospective in nature, it cannot be applied before plan confirmation.  A ccording to the 19 \n Acthar Plaintiffs, Debtors cannot satisfy the \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d standard regardless.  \nBelow the Co urt addresses, and rejects, each aspect of this argument.  \n1. Section 503(b)(4) Does Not Override \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) or 365(a)  \n \nAs Debtors correctly point out, the UST\u2019s  argument rests on a single canon of \nconstruction: the notion that a specific statute controls over a more general statute.  A s the \nSupreme Court explained in RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank , 566 U.S. 639, \n645 (2012), \u201cthe general/specific canon\u201d is applied either to \u201celiminate\u201d a \u201ccontradiction\u201d \nbetween two statutory provisions or to ensur e that the general provision does not render the more \nspecific provision \u201csuperflu[ous].\u201d  \nIn the Court\u2019s view, neither  circumstance is presented here.   In these circumstances, as \nthe Debtors correctly point out, a different canon of construction controls: \u201ccourts should \ninterpret a statute with . . . an ear for harmonizing potentially discordant provisions.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Emps. Ret. Sys. of the Virgin Islands v. Gov\u2019t of the Virgin Islands , 995 F.3d 66, 97 (3d Cir. \n2021) (quoting United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 344 (1971)).  T here is no contradiction \nbetween \u00a7 503(b), on the one hand, and \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a), on the other.  Nor would applying \n\u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a) according to their te rms render \u00a7 503(b)(4) superfluous.   \n All three statutory provisions can be given effect without raising any contradiction or \nsuperfluity concerns.  Sections 363(b) and 365(a), on the one hand, and \u00a7 503(b) , on the other, \nare directed at different parties, operate at different times, and serve different purposes.  Sections 363(b) and 365(a) permit debtors  (or trustees) to take actions for the benefit of the estate going \nforward based on their own business judgment .  See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b)(1) (permitting \u201ctrustee, \nafter notice and a hearing, [to] use, sell, or lease, other than in the ordinary course of business, property of the estate\u201d); id. \u00a7 365(a) (permitting \u201ctrustee, subject to the court\u2019s approval, [to] 20 \n assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor\u201d).  Section 503(b), by \ncontrast, permits creditors  (often over debtor objections) to seek allowance of an administrative \nexpense for past contributions  to an estate under a substantial contribution  standard.  See id.  \n\u00a7 503(b)(3)(D) (permitting claim after \u201ccreditor . . . mak[es] a substantial contribution in a case \nunder chapter 9 or 11 of this title\u201d).  Most of these distinctions are undisputed by the Achar Plaintiffs and UST .  Although t he \nUST  argues that \u00a7 503(b) is \u201cnot limited to creditors or otherwise exclusive of the debtor\u201d and \n\u201ccontains no reference to any applicant\u201d  (D.I. 15 at 23) , the UST cites no case in which a debtor \nhas actually sought relief under \u00a7 503(b) in similar circumstances .  Regardless, statutory \nprovisions do not have to be mutually exclusive for both to be given effect.  See, e.g., In re \nUdell , 454 F.3d 180, 184 -86 (3d Cir. 2006) (finding no conflict despite five -year \u201coverlap\u201d \nperiod during which two statutes apply, beca use \u201cthere is no overlap thereafter\u201d).  Even if \ndebtors could seek retrospective relief under \u00a7 503(b), it would be no source of statutory tension \nif debtors could also seek authority to pay creditor professional fees under \u00a7  363 or 365 during a \ncase for purposes that benefit the estate on a prospective or ongoing basis.  \nActhar Plaintiffs suggest a superfluity problem  but never explain how \u201c[a]llowing \npayment under \u00a7\u00a7 363 and 365\u201d could possibly \u201crender[] \u00a7 503 superfluous.\u201d  (D.I. 12 at 36)   \nCreditors cannot seek payment under \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) or 365(a) , and therefore \u00a7 503(b) continues to \nserve a clear purpose.  \nThe provisions are found in different chapters of the Bankruptcy Code , underscor ing their \ndistinct purposes .  Sections 363(b) and 365(a) are found in Chapter 3, Subchapter IV, entitled \n\u201cADMINISTRATIVE POWERS,\u201d which relates to powers of the trustee ( 11 U.S.C., ch. 3, \nsubch. IV ), whereas \u00a7 503 is found in Chapter 5, Subcha pter I the Bankruptcy Code, entitled 21 \n \u201cCREDITORS AND CLAIMS\u201d ( 11 U.S.C., ch. 5, subch. I ).  The fact that \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a) \nrelate to debtors \u2019 sale and use of estate property, whereas \u00a7 503(b) relates to creditors and \nallowance of administrative expense claims, is additional  evidence that the latter\u2019s requirements \nwere not intended to control in cases in which a debtor is seeking relief to pay for ongoing work \nfor the benefit of the estate.  See generally Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States , \n559 U.S. 229, 252 (2010) (interpreting statute \u201ccodified in a subchapter of the Bankruptcy Code entitled \u2018debtor\u2019s duties and benefits\u2019 . . . to govern advertisements aimed at creditors would be   . . . anomalous\u201d ) (citation omitted).  \nActhar Plaint iffs make a policy argument , suggesting the Court\u2019s interpretation of the \nstatutes creates the potential to \u201csidestep the dictates of Section 503\u201d via the deferential business judgment standard in \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a).  (D.I. 12 at 36)   Putting aside whether being \npersuaded by this policy argument would lead to a different result in the instant appeal, the fact is that the Court  is not persuaded by it.  Congress appears to have given debtors  \u2013 who are duty-\nbound to maximize value for all  parties -in-interest  \u2013 wider latitude than creditors, whose role is \noften limited to advancing their own narrow interests.  As the Third Circuit explained in Lebron v. Mechem Financial Inc. , 27 F.3d 937, 944 (3d Cir. 1994), the \u00a7 503(b) standard is directed at \nconcerns that \u201cthe benefit received by the estate must be more than an incidental one arising from activities the applicant has pursued in protecting his or her own interests.\u201d  Those concerns do not extend (at least to the same degree) to a debtor -in-possession, which owes a fiduciary duty \nto the estate as a whole.   See, e.g., In re Pinnacle Brands, Inc., 259 B.R. 46, 54 (Bankr. D. Del. \n2001); see also In re Adelphia Commc\u2019ns Corp., 441 B.R. 6, 12 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010) (recognizing that \u00a7 503(b)\u2019s \u201cprovisions are nonconsensual in nature\u201d and \u201c[b]y their terms, . . . do not require [the applicant to obtain] the assent or agreement of the debtor, chapter 11 trustee, 22 \n or any other party\u201d).  That there are different standards for debtor -initiated relief and creditor -\ninitiated  relief is sensible and provides no reason to ignore the plain ( and plainly applicable ) \nlanguage of \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a).  \nMoreover, s everal courts  have rejected the argument  that \u00a7  503(b) overrides \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) or \n365(a) , and the Bankruptcy Court relied on precedent in highly analogous circumstances.  For \nexample, in In re Bethlehem Steel Corp. , 2003 WL 21738964, at *11, the Southern District of \nNew York held that \u201csubsections 503(b)(3)(D) and (b)(4) do not bar a bankrupt cy court from \nallowing a debtor in possession to reimburse a creditor for professional fees  \u2013 provided, of \ncourse, that the standard for allowing transactions under \u00a7 363(b) has been met.\u201d  The court \nexplained that \u201c503(b)(3)(D) and (b)(4) are not rendered meaningless simply because in certain unique circumstances a bankruptcy court approves a debtor\u2019s motion to enter into an agreement to reimburse a creditor for professional fees,\u201d especially because \u201c[i]n most cases, a debtor will make no such motion, as it will not be in its business interest to do so  \u2013 or the court will refuse \napproval under \u00a7 363(b).\u201d  Id.  The  Bethlehem Steel court concluded that , because \u201cin most \ncases, if a creditor wants to be reimbursed, it must file an application under subsections 503(b)(3)(D) and (b)(4) . . . [t]hose provisions continue to serve a purpose.\u201d Id.  \nMore recently, with respect to another opioid- related bankruptcy filing, a bankruptcy \ncourt in New York applied the same reasoning to permit debtors to reimburse an ad hoc  \ncommittee\u2019s professional fees under \u00a7 363(b) and 365(a).  (App. 2214- 20 (In re Purdue Pharma \nOrder); see also App. 2190 ( In re Purdue Pharma Nov. 19, 2019 Hr\u2019g Tr.)  There, the debtors \nmoved to assume a reimbursement agreement and pay reasonable and documented fees under  \n\u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a).  ( App. 2215)  The UST  objected, arguing that \u201cthe code has a more \nspecific standard to pay the fees of an ad hoc committee and that would be under 503(b)(3)(d) 23 \n and (4) which require the ad hoc committee to show a substantial contribution before their fees \ncan be paid.\u201d  ( App. 2161- 62)  Adopting the reasoning of Bethlehem Steel , the Purdue Pharma \ncourt disagreed, explain ing that \u201cthere are a number of . . . f act patterns under the Bankruptcy \nCode where Courts have approved payments of ongoing fees and expenses not under Section 503(b) but under Section 363(b) or sometimes under Section 365,\u201d and specifically referencing requests for approval of an RSA, legal f ees of proposed bidders, and the fees and expenses of \nsecured creditors.  (App. 2190- 92)  As in those situations, the Purdue Pharma court concluded \nthat the legal standards of \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a) applied in the circumstances before it  and \nassessed \u201cwhether the entry into the agreement and the performance of it including the ongoing payment of the professional fees is a proper exercise of business judgement and in the best interest of the debtors and their  estates and creditors.\u201d  ( App. 2192- 93) \nOther courts have held likewise.  ( App. 1828 -1949 ( In re Dendreon Order) (approving \nprofessional fee payments  under \u00a7\u00a7 363 and 365 over UST\u2019s  objection); App. 1955- 96 (Hr\u2019g Tr., \nIn re RCS Capital Corp., Case No. 16- 10223 (MFW) (Bankr. D. Del. Mar. 16, 2016), [Doc. No. \n334]) (\u201cI disagree with the United States Trustee that I need to wait and see if the plan is confirmed before I can approve such [professional] fees.\u201d).  T he cases relied upon by the Acthar \nPlaintiffs a nd the UST  are inapposit e.  None  of those cases consider ed the interplay between  \n\u00a7 363(b) or \u00a7 365(a) and \u00a7 503(b).   \nActhar Plaintiffs and the UST  rely primarily on a series of cases in which the Third \nCircuit affirmed a bankruptcy court\u2019s decision not t o approve break- up fees under \u00a7 503(b).  In \nre O\u2019Brien Environmental Energy, Inc., 181 F.3d 527, 532 (3d Cir. 1999), involved a retrospective request for payment of a break -up fee and expenses by a disappointed bidder , \nCalpine, in connection with its unsuc cessful bid.  The decision did not involve (at least in 24 \n relevant part) a request by the debtor for prospective authorization to award Calpine a break- up \nfee and expense reimbursement; in fact, that authorization had been sought, but previously \ndenied, by t he bankruptcy court on the grounds that it would chill bidding.  See i d. at 529.  The \nCalpine motion was \u201coriginally captioned\u201d as a \u201cmotion under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b) ;\u201d despite \nCalpine\u2019s later attempts to argue that the motion was governed not by that section but instead by \u201cthe applicable case law setting forth standards for approval of break- up fees and break- up \nexpenses,\u201d the court found \u00a7 503 to be \u201cthe most likely s ource of authority\u201d for the motion.  Id . \nat 527, 532. \nThe portion of O\u2019Brien  on which appellants and UST rely most heavily is the Third \nCircuit\u2019s statement that it found no support for the proposition that \u201ccourts may create a right to recover from the ban kruptcy estate where no such right exists under the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d  Id .  \nat 532.  This statement must be understood in context; specifically, in the context of a non -\ndebtor  requesting to recover on its claim from estate assets while admitting it had no statutory \nbasis to do so.  See id.  at 532 (noting that creditor asserted right to recover only under \n\u201capplicable case law\u201d rather than any provision of Bankruptcy Code).  Here, the Debtors made their request in express reliance on \u00a7 363 of the Bankruptcy C ode.  In the context of addressing \nCalpine\u2019s  attempt to disclaim the only asserted statutory basis for relief, and recharacterize its \n\u201crequest\u201d as one \u201cmade under the applicable case law,\u201d the O\u2019Brien  court explained that there \nwas no \u201csupport for the proposition that courts may create a right to recover from the bankruptcy estate where no such right exists under the Bankruptcy Code ,\u201d and then \u201cdecline[d] the invitation \nto develop a general common law of break- up fees.\u201d   Id.  Notably, the court cited \u00a7 363 as one \nexample by which the Bankruptcy Code did provide for such relief.  See i d. (filing of Chapter 11 \npetition \u201cprecludes all efforts to obtain or distribute property of the estate other than as provided 25 \n by the Bankruptcy Code, see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362, 363, 1123\u201d).  In short , O\u2019Brien addressed  \nwhether a disappointed bidder could itself s eek extra- statutory relief  \u2013 not whether , as here,  a \ndebtor could seek relief under other statutory  provisions. \nThe UST  cites two cases applying O\u2019Brien (again, to break -up fees ), but neither \naddresses whether the debtor can seek such fees under \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) or 365(a), and neither  says \nanything about the sort of professional fees at issue here.  In re Reliant Energy Channelview LP , \n594 F.3d 200, 206- 09 (3d Cir. 2010), simply applied the \u00a7 503(b) standard to a n unsuccessful \nbidder\u2019s application for a break- up fee.  In re Energy Future Holdings Corp. (\u201cEFH I\u201d) , 904 \nF.3d 298, 314- 16 (3d Cir. 2018), held only that the bankruptcy court did not violate Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 59(e) in reconsidering its earlier break -up fee decision that had been based on \na mistake of fact.  \nOther courts have declined to extend the reasoning of O\u2019Brien even to relatively \nanalogous circumstances like bidders\u2019 \u201cdue diligence reimbursement fees,\u201d which can \u201cbe \nreimbursed regardless of whether the [bidders] were ultimately successfu l.\u201d  In re ASARCO, \nL.L.C., 650 F.3d 593, 602 (5th Cir. 2011) (distinguishing O\u2019Brien and Reliant as \u201cappl[ying] \nsection 503(b) and not 363(b)\u201d and involving \u201cbreak- up fees [that] were to be paid only if the \nprospective bidder was unsuccessful\u201d).  \nThe UST  also cites In re F/S Airlease II, Inc., 844 F.2d 99, 108 (3d Cir. 1988).  In that \ncase, the Third Circuit refused to allow a professional to recover fees under \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A) when he was ineligible to recover the same fees under the neighboring provision, \u00a7 503(b)(2) , because \nhe failed to comply with a necessary precondition to recovery.  The court explained that \u201csection 327(a)\u201d puts requirements on the \u201cauthority to pay administrative expenses for [trustee -\nemployed] professionals\u201d under \u00a7 503(b)(2).   Id. at 108.  The professional had failed to obtain 26 \n the prior approval required under \u00a7 327(a), despite being \u201ca sophisticated businessman who was \nrepresented by attorneys ,\u201d id. at 106- 08, w hich is why he sought relief under \u00a7 503(b)(1) instead.  \nThe court refused to read two provisions  \u2013 503(b)(1) and (b)(2)  \u2013 that actually do \u201cexist side -by-\nside\u201d ( D.I. 15 at 18)  (unlike the provisions at issue in the instant case) as covering precisely the \nsame expenses in a way that would allow professionals to circumvent a critical statutory pre -\napproval requirement.  The Court agrees with the Debtors, therefore, that F/S Airlease II has \nlittle to do with this case.3   \nThe Acthar Plaintiffs also rely on the Southern District of New York\u2019s decision in In re \nLehman Bros. Holdings Inc., 508 B.R. 283 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). There, the court refused to allow individual members of an official creditors committee to rely on \u00a7\u00a7 1123(b)(6) and 1129(a), instead of  \u00a7 503(b), to recover expenses on a retrospective basis, as part of a plan of \nreorganization.  See id.  at 288- 89, 293.  The court explained that \u00a7 503(b) expressly prohibited \nsuch payments absent the necessary \u201csubstantial contribution,\u201d and that parties c ould not \neffectively contract around that prohibition by agreeing to include the payments in the plan itself.  See i d. at 289- 94.  Lehman Brothers thus focused on retrospective payments expressly prohibited \nby \u00a7 503(b) .  It, like all the other authorities cited by appellants, does not persuade the Court to \nreach a different outcome.  \n2. Section 503(b)\u2019s Substantial Contribution Test Is Inapplicable  \n \n The Acthar Plaintiffs spend much of their brief arguing that Debtors failed to satisfy  \n\u00a7 503(b)\u2019s \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d test.  (D.I. 12 at 45- 50)  To the extent they argue that  \n \n3 The Acthar Plaintiffs cite two out- of-circuit cases that stand for the same general principle as \nF/S Airlease and are distinguishable for the same reasons.  See In re Snowcrest Dev. Grp., Inc., 200 B.R. 473, 479 (Bankr. D. Mas s. 1996); In re Off. Prods. of Am., Inc., 136 B.R. 675, 686- 87 \n(Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1992).   27 \n \u00a7 503(b) is retrospective only and could not have been satisfied when the Debtors brought the \nInitial Fee Motion at the outset of these cases, the Court  agrees .  But this argument leads back to \nwhether \u00a7 503(b) overrides the prospective options available to Debtors under \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) and 365(a)  \u2013 as the Court has explained, it does not.  T o the extent the Acthar Plaintiffs are  making a \nrecord -based argument about whether the reimbursement agreements actually further the \ninterests of the estate, t he Bankruptcy Court made ample findings in support of its decision, and \nthey are not clearly erroneous.  While \u00a7  503(b)\u2019s substantial contribution standard has no role in  assessing compliance \nwith \u00a7\u00a7 363(b) or 365(a) , the business judgment rule, which does apply, considers whether \nentering into post -petition reimbursement agreements, or assuming pre -petition reimbursement \nagreements, is in the best interest of the estate.  As the district court explained in Bethlehem Steel , 2003 WL 21738964, at *10, \u201cSection 363(b) does not permit the debtor in possession to \nuse funds solely to benefit a creditor.  If the payment of a creditor\u2019s fees were  simply aimed at \nhelping the creditor promote its own self -interest, the payment would not be permitted under  \n\u00a7 363(b).\u201d  That is the standard the Bankruptcy Court applied and found satisfied here.  (See, \ne.g., App. 1454)  (proposed order  \u201ccomplies  with  [the court\u2019s] previous  ruling regarding what  \nwould be  required  for reimbursements  . . . in  that it assures  that the reimbursements  will be  for \nwork  that benefits  the debtors\u2019  estates  as a whole, rather  than  individual  credit ors or creditor  \ngroups\u201d) ) \nThus, a ll of the Acthar  Plaintiffs\u2019  arguments  under  the \u201csubstantial  contribution\u201d  heading \neither  apply the  wrong standard  or merely  take issue  with  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s  non- erroneous  \nfactual  findings.  For  example,  the Acthar  Plaintiffs  suggest  the Bankruptcy  Court  \u201cassum[ed],  \nwithout  evidence,  that participation  in mediation  will in  some  way  materially  enhance the  28 \n recovery  to other  creditors.\u201d   (D.I.  12 at 44)  Acthar  Plaintiffs  do not  address , however, Debtors\u2019  \nunrebutted evid ence:  the uncertainty, loss  of confidence,  and likely  need  to \u201cspend  substantially  \nmore  time  in bankruptcy (with  correspondingly higher  restructuring  costs),\u201d  all support  the \nfinding that  \u201closs  of RSA  Party  support  would be  detrimental not  only to  the Debt ors, but to all \ncreditors.\u201d   (App. 515- 16)  Similarly,  the assertion  that \u201cthe mediation  benefitted  only those  \nparticipating  in it\u201d (D.I.  12 at 47) ignores  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s  contrary  findings  (see App. \n1454- 55). \n  3. Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 Remaining  Argum ents Are Unavailing  \n \n The Acthar Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments, which the UST  does not advance, fare no \nbetter.  Acthar Plaintiffs invoke the law of the case doctrine (D.I. 12 at 28- 31, 41- 42) to argue \nthat the Bankruptcy Court was required to apply \u00a7 503(b) and its \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d \nstandard in ruling on the Second Fee Motion, based on dicta contained in the bench ruling on the Initial Feel Motion .  In the Court\u2019s view, the  Acthar  Plaintiffs  misread  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s  \ninterim bench  ruling on the  Initial Fee  Motion.  The  Bankruptcy C ourt never  said that \u201c11 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 503 controlled.\u201d   (D.I.  12 at  41) (citing  App. 727- 66)  If that had been  its holding, there would \nhave  been  no reason  to deny the  motion  without  prejudice .  Nor  would the  Bankruptcy C ourt\u2019s  \nruling that  \u201cSection  363 provides  the procedural  mechanism\u201d for the  relief  sought  have  made \nsense.   (App. 761)   Rather,  the Bankruptcy C ourt allowed  Debtors  to renew  their request  under  \n\u00a7\u00a7 363(b)  or 365(a)  after  entering  into new  reimbursement  agreements  and/or  assuming the  pre-\npetition  reimbursement  agreements.   (App. 765)    \nAdditionally, t he law of the case doctrine  binds  litigants; it does  not limit a  court\u2019s  power.  \nSee Speeney  v. Rutgers , 369 F.  App\u2019x 357, 359 (3d Cir. 2010)  (\u201cThe law  of the case . . . is  a \ndiscretionary  doctrine  [and]  not a restriction  on the  court\u2019s  power.\u201d ).  Furthermore,  an interim,  29 incorrect  ruling would not bind this  Court on appeal.   See Musacchio  v. United  States , 577 U.S.  \n237, 245 (2016) (\u201cAn  appellate court\u2019s  function is  to revisit matters  decided  in the trial court. . . .  \n[I]t is not bound by district court rulings under the law -of-the- case doc trine.\u201d).\nThe remaining  arguments raised  by the Acthar  Plaintiffs  are also rejected.   Their  \nargument that  payments authorized  by the Fee Order  violate  the absolute priority  rule is \nmisplaced  for the reasons  set forth  in the Debtors\u2019 brief.   (See D.I.  17 at 50-52)  The  Court rejects  \nActhar  Plaintiffs \u2019 unfounded and  inappropriate allegations  of criminal fraud  in arguing that  the \nBankruptcy Court\u2019s  order violates  public policy.  ( See D.I.  12 at  55-58) \nV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Fee Order will be affirmed.  An appropriate Order follows. \n________________________________\n \nHONORABLE  LEONARD  P.
