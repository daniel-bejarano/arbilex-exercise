(D.I. 175; see also  D.I. 194 \nat 1)  For the reasons  set out below, the Court DENIES  the Motion.    \nI. BACKGROUND   \n Because the parties are in the later stages of this case and desire a timely decision on the \nMotion, the Court writes primarily for them, and so it will dispense with  a lengthy recitation of \nthe facts relating to th is dispute.  To the extent that certain facts of record are relevant, the Court \nwill note them in Section II.   \n On June 29, 2022, Defendants filed the instant M otion.  (D.I. 175 )  The Motion was fully \nbriefed as of August 1, 2022.  (D.I. 224)  \nII. DISCUSSION  \n Relevant to this dispute is Defendants \u2019 counterclaim of inequitable conduct.  Therein, \nDefendants allege that Plaintiff (via its then -affiliate, Tyco Fire and Security Services, or 2 \n \u201cTFSS\u201d )1 and its prosecuting attorneys, including in- house counsel Frank Cona and outside \ncounsel Evan Sotiriou, intentionally abandoned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/801,484 \n(the \u201c'484 application\u201d) \u2014the application that ultimately led to asserted U.S. Patent No. \n7,307,652 (the \u201c '652 patent\u201d) \u2014in favor of related patent applications .  (D.I. 8 at 11- 28; D.I. 160;  \nD.I. 194 at 1- 2)  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) thereafter issued a \nNotice of Abandonment as to the '484 application  in December 2004, and the patent applicant \ndid not submit a petition to revive the application until May 2006, approximately 18 months later.  ( D.I. 8 at 14; D.I. 194 at 2)   Defendants al lege that when Mr. Sotiriou thereafter told the \nUSPTO that the delay in reviving the application was unintentional, this was knowingly false\u2014and thus that this and related acts amount to inequitable conduct  on Plaintiff\u2019s part .  (D.I. 8 at 16-\n28)   \nWith their Motion, Defendants are seeking documents and communications between \nPlaintiff\u2019s in -house and outside counsel that relate to the prosecution of the ' 652 patent  and \nrelated patents, which Plaintiff has withheld as being protected by the attorney- client privilege.  \n(D.I. 175 at 1)  Defendants argue that Plaintiff has waived any privilege applicable to these \ndocuments by asserting a defense to the inequitable conduct counterclaim \u2014set out in Plaintiff\u2019s \npending motion for summary judgment of no inequitable conduct  (\u201cMSJ\u201d) , (D.I. 123) \u2014that puts \nPlaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 advice  firmly  \u201cat issue\u201d in this litigation , (D.I. 194 at 4 ). \nIn Rhone -Poulenc Rorer Inc. v. Home Indem. Co., 32 F.3d 851 (3d Cir. 1994), the  United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit explained the contours of the \u201cat issue\u201d doctrine.\n2  \n \n1  Herein,  for ease of  reference,  the Court  will refer  to TFSS  as \u201cPlaintiff.\u201d  \n \n2  In this patent  case,  the Court  follows  regional  circuit law  as to disputes  relating  to \nthe applicability  of the attorney -client  privilege  and related  doctrines, to  the extent  that those  \nissues are not  unique  to patent  law.   See  INVISTA  N. Am. S.a.r.l. v.  M&G  USA  Corp., Civil 3 \n The Third Circuit noted that when a party takes the affirmative step of placing its attorney\u2019s \nadvice at  issue in defending against a claim, courts have found that  by doing so, that  party has \nopened to examination facts relating to the  advice.  Rhone -Poulenc Rorer Inc., 32 F.3d at 863.  \nBut the Rhone -Poulenc Court went on to caution that ad vice is not in issue merely because it is \nrelevant, nor simply because it might affect the client\u2019s state of mind in a relevant manner; instead, such advice is placed at issue only where the \u201cclient asserts a claim or defense, and \nattempts to prove that claim or defense by disclosing or describing an attorney client communication.\u201d  Id . (emphasis added).  \n In Rhone -Poulenc , the Third Circuit was emphasizing that t he \u201cat issue\u201d doctrine only \napplies when the party puts at issue the actual contents  of an attor ney-client communication in \nsupport of its  claim or defense.  Id.  (explaining that in the patent context , for example, the \u201cat \nissue\u201d doctrine can lead to waiver when privileged communications are used to rebut the charge \n \nAction  No. 11-1007- SLR-CJB,  2013 WL  12171721, at  *4 n.4 (D.  Del.  June  25, 2013)  (citing  \ncases).   However,  when a deter mination  of the applicability  of a privilege  implicates  a \nsubstantive  patent  law issue,  the law of the United  States  Court  of Appeals  for the Federal  \nCircuit applies.   Id. (citing  cases).    \n \nIn their  opening letter  brief,  Defendants  suggested  that Third  Circuit law applied  to this \ndispute, as  they  cited  exclusively  to Third  Circuit cases  in setting  out the contours  of the \u201cat \nissue\u201d  doctrine.  (D.I.  194 at  4)  In its answering brief,  Plaintiff  did not  disagree with  that \nposition ( Plaintiff  therein  simply  explained  its view  as to why  Third  Circuit  caselaw  did not  \nsupport  Defendants \u2019 position).  (D.I.  211 at  4)  Then,  in their  reply  brief,  Defendants  for the  first \ntime mentioned Federal  Circuit law  and vaguely suggested that  that law might  apply instead.   \n(D.I.  224 at  3)  But  Defendants  immediately  noted thereafter  that when  it comes  to the issue  of \nhow attorney -client  privilege d information  is placed  \u201cat issue\u201d  in a case,  \u201cthe Federal  Circuit \ndoes not differ\u201d  from  the Third  Circuit.   (Id.)   \n \nBecause Defendants themselves initially relied on Third Circuit caselaw here (as did \nPlaintiff) and because Defendants assert that the Third Circuit\u2019s approach to this issue is no \ndifferent from that of the Federal Circuit, the Court will herein apply Third Circuit law regarding \nthe \u201cat issue\u201d doctrine to this patent case.  Cf.  Elm 3DS Innovations, LLC  v. Samsung Elecs.  Co., \nC.A. No. 14- 1430- LPS-JLH, 2021 WL 4819904, at *1 (D. Del. Oct. 15, 2021) . \n 4 \n of willful infringement, but only when \u201cthe infringer seeks to limit its liability by describing that \nadvice and by asserting that he relied on that advice\u201d) (emphasis added) ; see also Livingstone  v. \nNorth Belle Vernon Borough, 91 F.3d 515, 537 n. 36 (3d Cir. 1996) (noting that the \u201cat issue\u201d \ndoctrine applies when a party puts \u201cthe substance of counsel\u2019s advice\u201d at issue via their claim or defense);  Glenmede Tr. Co. v. Thompson, 56 F.3d 476, 486 (3d Cir. 1995) (concluding that a \nparty waived the attorney -client privilege by putting at issue reliance on the advice of counsel , \nwhere the party voluntarily produced an opinion letter that included the content of certain of the advice at issue) .  This is perhaps easiest to see by looking at the two cases from the United States \nDistrict Court fo r the District of New Jersey that  were cited by the Rhone -Poulenc  Court  in \nexplaining the rationale behind the \u201cat issue\u201d doctrine.  Rhone -Poulenc Rorer Inc. , 32 F.3d at \n863 (citing N. River Ins. Co. v. Phila. Reins . Corp., 797 F. Supp. 363 (D.N.J. 1992); Pittston Co. \nv. Allianz Ins. Co., 143 F.R.D. 66 (D.N.J. 1992)).  In N. River Ins. Co. v. Phila. Reins . Corp., 797 \nF. Supp. 363 (D.N.J. 1992), the C ourt explained that the \u201cat issue\u201d doctrine \u201cshould be construed \nnarrowly to create an implied waiver of the attorney -client privilege only when a party puts \u2018in \nissue\u2019 the contents  of an attorney client communication\u201d by confirming that it \u201cintends to prove  \n[its claim or defense] by disclosure of [the] attorney- client communication\u201d itself.  797 F. Supp. \nat 370 (emphasis in original) .  And in Pittston Co. v. Allianz Ins. Co., 143 F.R.D. 66 (D.N.J. \n1992) , the Court explained that the \u201ca t issue\u201d doctrine should apply only where a party has \nasserted a claim or defense that it \u201cintends to prove by use of the privileged materials \u201d such that \nit could be said that the party seeking protection has \u201cinjected the communications into the action[.] \u201d  143 F.R.D. at 71 (emphasis added).  \n Because of the importance of the attorney -client privilege, the Third Circuit construes the \n\u201cat issue\u201d waiver \u201cnarrowly [.]\u201d  In re Teleglobe Comm c\u2019ns Corp., 392 B.R. 561, 586 ( D. Del.  5 \n 2008)  (citing Rhone -Poulenc  Rorer Inc ., 32 F.3d at 863) .  The Rhone -Poulenc  Court explained \nthat this approach is appropriate because it is consistent with the \u201c essential elements of the \nprivilege.\u201d   32 F.3d at 863.  In this re gard, t he Third Circuit noted that by interpreting the \u201cat \nissue\u201d doctrine  in the manner set out above , this \u201cleave[s] to the client the decision whether or \nnot to waive the privilege by putting the attorney\u2019s advice in issue\u201d ; it also allows for certainty \nand predictability, in that the client knows that its confidential communications will not be \ndisclosed unless it takes the \u201c affirmative step \u201d of waiving privilege by directly utilizing the \ncontents of a privileged communication as part of its claim or defense.  Id. at 863- 64.  The \nRhone -Poulenc  Court rejected the idea that the \u201cat issue\u201d doctrine  could be invoked simply whe n \na party \u2019s state of mind is at issue in the litigation.  Id. at 864.  The Third Circuit  explained that \nwhile in such a scenario, facts about the client\u2019s state of mind may be \u201crelevant\u201d (or \u201cvital \u201d or \n\u201chighly probative \u201d or \u201ceven go to the heart of an issue\u201d), a \u201cfinding that confidentiality may be \nwaived depending on the relevance of the communication completely undermines\u201d the interest to \nbe served by the attorney -client privilege\u2014i.e., ensuring that the client can consult with their \ncounsel in confidence.  Id .    \n With the relevant law now set out, the Court turns to Defendants \u2019 arguments.  Defendant s \nassert that in nine paragraphs of a concise statement of facts (\u201cSOF\u201d) that Plaintiff  filed along \nwith its MSJ  (paragraphs 12- 16, 22, 24, 26 and 30 ), Plaintiff clearly showed how it has  put its \nattorney -client communications  at issue in the case.  (D.I. 194 at 1)  So the question becomes:  In \nthese nine SOF paragraphs  (and, relatedly, in Plaintiff\u2019s MSJ) , did Plaintiff actually put at issue \nthe actual contents  of an otherwise privileged communication?  Below, the Court examines \nDefendants \u2019 arguments about each of the SOF paragraphs that are at issue  here.   \n\u2022 Paragraphs 12 and 30:  In these paragraphs, Plaintiff states \nthat:  (1) in or around June 2005, it realized that the '484 6 \n application had been unintentionally abandoned; and (2) Mr. \nCona testified that this happened either because the deadline for filing a required r eply was \u201cmisdocketed\u201d or that he and his \ncolleagues just \u201cmissed\u201d the deadline .  (D.I. 124 at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 30 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted))   The Court \ndoes not see how this amounts to Plaintiff using the contents of otherwise privileged attorney -client communication s to make \nout its defense.  Plaintiff here is characterizing the abandonment as unintentional and suggesting possible factual reasons as to why this might be so, nothing more.  (D.I. 211 at 2)  While privileged communications between Mr. Cona and others associated with Plaintiff might be relevant  to their  state \nof mind regarding the reason for the abandonment , relevance is \nnot the t est.\n3  (D.I. 194 at 4 (Defendant s acknowledging that \nwere Plaintiff simply to make  reference to its attorneys\u2019 state of \nmind, that  itself  \u201cmay not result in waiver\u201d))    \n \n\u2022 Paragraphs 13, 14 and 15:  In these paragraphs, Plaintiff \nexplains how, after realizing that the '484 application had been unintentionally abandoned in June 2005, it engaged Armstrong Teasdale LLP (\u201cArmstrong Teasdale\u201d) to \u201c prepare and file a \npetition to revive \u201d the application (and how Mr. S otiriou of that \nfirm was the person selected to work on the petition to revive ).  \n(D.I. 124 at \u00b6\u00b6 13- 15)  Defendants argue that by asserting that \nArmstrong Teasdale was hired to \u201cprepare and file a petition to \nrevive\u201d the '484 application, Plaintiff is \u201ccharacteriz[ing] the \ninstructions communicated to and between attorneys on how to \nhandle the [] [a]pplication \u2014correspondence [Plaintiff] \nwithheld as privileged and precluded questioning by instruction.\u201d  (D.I. 194 at 2)  The Court disagrees.  In these paragraphs, Plaintiff is di scussing only non- privileged facts :  \ni.e., that :  (1) it hired a law firm; (2) the law firm was to and \ndid prepare and file a petition  to revive ; and (3)  a particular \n \n3  At one point  in his deposition, Defendants  asked  Mr. Cona  how  he had figured  \nout that abandonment  of the application  was unintentional.  To  this,  Mr. Cona  responded that  he \ndid not  recall  how  this was discovered,  but he thought  that the discovery would hav e come \n\u201cduring the  review  of the cases  or the docket[.]\u201d  (D.I.  129, ex.  10 at  152)   Defendants  then  point  \nto the fact that certain  screen  captures  of a \u201cTyco  patent  database\u201d have been  withheld  as \nprivileged by Plaintiff,  (D.I.  157, ex.  I at 7), and they  suggest  that Mr. Cona\u2019s  reference to  \u201ccases  \nor the docket\u201d  must  be a reference  to these withheld  databases,  (D.I.  194 at  2).  But  Plaintiff  \ndenies  that this is so, (D.I.  211 at  2), and it is not clear  at all to the Court  that Mr. Cona  was \nreferencing  allegedly  privileged document s in this deposition answer .  Indeed,  when  asked  \nduring his  deposition about  the references  to a \u201cTyco  patent  database\u201d on Plai ntiff\u2019s  privilege  \nlog, Mr.  Cona  testified  that he did not  know  what  those  entries  refer red to.  (D.I.  129, ex.  10 at \n106-07) 7 \n attorney (Mr. Sotiriou) received the assignment  to work on the \nmatter .  (D.I. 211 at 2)  Plaintiff could have (but did not) \nattempt to augment those facts with the content of information \ndrawn from actual communications  between it and Armstrong \nTeasdale attorneys , or among those attorneys.  Ha d it done  so, \nPlaintiff  would have been using otherwise privileged attorney -\nclient communications  as part of its defense, and that would \nhave placed other such similar privileged communications \u201c at \nissue. \u201d  But  Plaintiff did no t take this step here.4 \n \n\u2022 Paragraphs 16, 22, 24 and 26:  In these paragraphs, Plaintiff \nstates that:  (1) in late 2005, Mr. Cona and Mr. Sotiriou worked \non preparing the petition and related USPTO filings; (2)  in \nMay 2006, Mr. Cona \u201crealized\u201d that no petition to revive had been filed \u201cand inquired\u201d  about that; (3) the \u201centire delay in \nfiling the petition to revive the '484 [a]pplication was \nunintentional\u201d and (4) Plaintiff\u2019s statement to the USPTO that the delay was unintentional \u201cwas true and correct.\u201d  (D.I. 124 at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 22, 24, 26)  Defendants assert that in these paragraphs, Plaintiff is attempting to \u201caffirmatively prove the attorne ys\u2019 state of mind as \u2018unintentional\u2019 by characterizing \ncommunications withheld as privilege [d].\u201d  (D.I. 194 at 3)  To \na great extent, this argument  is easily dismissed .  Instead, the \nbulk of these statements are either statements of fact (i.e., about what Mr. Cona and Mr. Sot iriou did) or  assertions about what \nthe attorneys\u2019/ Plaintiff\u2019s state of mind  was at a given time \u2014not \nstatements that weaponize the content of otherwise privileged attorney -client communications .  (D.I. 211 at 3)  The one \n \n4  It is true,  as Defendants  note,  that Defendants\u2019  counsel  asked  Mr. Cona  and Mr. \nSotiriou  during their  depositions  about  certain  communications  between  Plaintiff  and Armstrong  \nTeasdale (or among Armstrong  Teasdale attorneys)  in late 2005, after  Plaintiff  had hired  the \nfirm.  (D.I.  194 at  2)  But  that is not an example of  Plaintiff  affirmatively  seeking to  use the \ncontent  of those  communications  in its defense\u2014it is  an example of  Defendant s seeking  to gain  \naccess  to privileged communications  and Plaintiff  invoking the  privilege  to deny such  access.    \n As the Court  has noted above, t hat Armstrong  Teasdale was  hired  by Plaintiff  and was to \n\u201cprepare  and file a petition  to revive\u201d on behalf  of Plaintiff  are facts  that are themselves  evident  \nfrom  non- privileged sources .  After all,  the firm  did eventually  publicly file  such  a petition  on \nbehalf  of Plaintiff.   Now,  suppos e that in its MSJ,  Plaintiff  had also written :  \u201cAfter  hiring \nArmstrong  Teasdale,  Mr. Cona  immediately  e-mailed  Mr. Sotiriou , instructing:   \u2018Please file  a \npetition  right  away,  with  no delay .  As we have discussed, it is  important  that this filing  be on \nrecord  as quickly as  possible ; please spare no expense! \u2019\u201d  Had  Plaintiff  done  this, its reference \nwould clearly  be an example  of the use of the content  of otherwise  privileged communications  to \nsupport  its defense.   But  Plaintiff  did not  do anything like  that in paragraphs  13-15 of  the SOF  or \nelsewhere in  its MSJ. 8 \n arguable exception is the statement, found in paragraph 22, that \nafter Mr. Cona realized in May 2006 that no petition to revive \nhad yet been filed, he \u201cinquired\u201d about it  with Armstrong \nTeasdale.  (D.I. 124 at \u00b6 22 (citing D.I. 129, ex. 10 at 127))  \nThis statement a bout Mr. Cona\u2019s \u201c inquir [y]\u201d might  (if \nconsidered  in a vacuum ) suggest that Plaintiff is  putting at \nissue the substance of communications that Mr. Cona thereafter had with Armstrong Teasdale attorneys (i.e., about why  it was  \nthat the petition had not been filed) .  But in the end , the Court \ndoes not think that this stray reference in paragraph 22 amounts to waiver.  That is in significant part because, so far as the Court can tell, Plaintiff never cites to this p ortion of para graph \n22 (that is, regarding the substance of what Mr. Cona \n\u201cinquired\u201d about , or the substance of any responses he was \ngiven) in its MSJ filing s.\n5   \n \nUltimately, in these nine SOF paragraphs, Plaintiff is , inter alia , making assertions about \nits state of mind  and the state of mind of its counsel, in support of its defense to the  inequitable \nconduct counterclaim.  And it is surely true that Plaintiff\u2019s attorney -client communications \nregarding the petition to revive and related matters would be relevant  to what \nPlaintiff \u2019s/Plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s state of mind truly was at the time .  But in none of the  nine  SOF \nparagraphs does Plaintiff attempt to use the actual content  of otherwise privileged attorney- client \ncommunications  as a sword \u2014i.e., as an affirmative means to defeat Defendants\u2019 counterclaim.  \n(D.I. 211 at 1 (\u201cIn [denying liability as to the counterclaim] Sensormatic does not characterize, \nselectively disclose , or otherwise rely on the substance of any withheld communications.\u201d))  It is \nthat type  of offensive  use of otherwise privileged material that, pursuant to relevant precedent, \namounts to putting privileged attorney -client communication s \u201cat issue\u201d in a case.  See \nTeleglobe , 392 B.R. at 586 (concluding that there was no waiver based on the \u201cat issue\u201d doctrine, \n \n5  Again, during Mr.  Cona\u2019s  deposition, Defendants  did ask  questions  seeking  to \nlearn  the substance  of Mr. Cona\u2019s  May  2006 inquiry with  Armstrong  Teasdale.   (D.I.  129, ex. 10 \nat 127, 164- 65)  But  Mr. Cona  did not  divulge  those  communications.  ( Id.)  He either  testified  \nthat he did not  recall  what  was said in those  conversations, or  he was prohibited from  sharing \nthat information  via a privi lege objection from  Plaintiff\u2019s  counsel.
