Pending before the Court \nis a motion to dismiss the appeal (D.I. 7) (\u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d) filed by Joseph J. Farnan, Jr., as \nTrustee of the Reorganized TK Holdings Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d)  on August 19, 2022.  The Motion to \nDismiss asserts that  Appe llant lacks standing to appeal the Order  and that the appeal is untimely .  \nBy Order dated September 7, 2022 (D.I. 8), I directed Appellant to file an answering brief or response to the Motion to Dismiss no later than  September 28, 2022.  Rather than file such a \nresponse, Appellant filed two  requests : (i) a motion to stay the appeal pending \u201can administrative \nprocedural ruling of Court and its jurisdiction\u201d (D.I. 9) (the \u201cMotion for Stay\u201d) ; and (ii) a request \n \n1 The docket of the chapter 11 cases, captioned In re TK Holdings Inc., et al., Case No. 17-\n11375- BLS (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \u201cB.D.I. __.\u201d 2 \n for \u201ca rbitration /mediation\u201d  and \u201cdefault judgment \u201d demand in the amount of  $31,500 (D.I. 10)  \n(the \u201cMotion for Default Judgment\u201d) . 1F2  For the reasons set forth below, the  Trustee\u2019s  Motion to \nDismiss will be granted , and Appellant \u2019s motions will be  dismissed  as moot .  \n1. Background.    Debtors  comprise d one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers and \ndistributors of automotive safety systems , including vehicle airbag systems  using inflators that \ncontain pyrotechnic propellants, stored high pressure gases, or a combination of the two which, \nwhen activated, rapidly release gases to inflate an airbag.  The record reflects that Debtors  sold \nairbag inflators containing phase -stabilized a mmonium nitrate (\u201cPSAN  inflators\u201d) , which were \neventually  the subject of the largest product reca ll in history.   On June 25, 2017, each of the \nDebtors commenced voluntary cases under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.    \n2. On February 21, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (B.D.I. 2120) (the \n\u201cConfirmation Order\u201d) confirming a plan of reorganization  (B.D.I. 2116) (the \u201cPlan\u201d).  Pursuant \nto the Plan, the Trust was established to administer certain post- effective date responsibilities \nunder the Plan.  Those responsibilities include  resolving certain d isputed c laims  against the \nestate,  including claims asserting economic loss arising from or relating to PSAN inflators and \nother asserted defects, and making distributions to holders of allowed claims .  (Plan Art. 5.6(b) ).  \nThe Plan further granted the Trustee authority to prosecute and resolve objections to disputed claims , with certain exceptions not relevant here.  ( Plan, Art. 5.6(e) ). \n3. On April 26, 2022, the  Trustee filed the Reorganized TK Holdings Trust\u2019s \nTwenty- Eighth Omnibus Objection to Claims \u2013 Non -Substantive (Amended & Superseded, \nDuplicate Claims, Late Claims)  (B.D.I. 4679) (the \u201c28th Claim Objection\u201d) that objected to \nvarious proofs of claim, including to Appellant\u2019s proof of claim #P -0058409 (\u201cAppellant\u2019s \nClaim\u201d) asserting an economic loss in an unknown amount.  The Appellant filed a response to \n \n2 Identical filings from the Appellant were docketed on September 27, 2022 .  (D.I. 1 1, 12) . 3 \n the Claim Objection ( B.D.I. 4700) (\u201cResponse\u201d).  Although the Response is difficult to parse, it \nappears to assert a claim in the amount of $31,500 related to the product recall . \n4. Thereafter, Trustee adjourned the hearing on the 28th Claim Objection as to \nAppellant\u2019s C laim ( and certain other claims)  to a later date.  (See D.I. 7, Exh . B (hearing agendas \nfor hearings on May 31, 2022 and July 27, 2022 noting adjournment of the hearing on the 28th \nClaim Objection as it relates to Appellant\u2019s C laim) ).  In connection with that adjournment, \nTrustee also removed the Appellant\u2019s C laim from the proposed order on the 28th Claim \nObjection and filed,  under  certification of counsel , a revised proposed order, which exclud ed \nAppellant\u2019s C laim.  ( See D.I. 7, Exh . C).  On May 31, 2022, the B ankruptcy C ourt entered the \n28th Claim Objection Order, which did not include Appellant\u2019s C laim.  ( See id., Exh . D). \n5. On June 29, 2022, Appellant purported to file a notice of appeal (B.D.I. 4730) \n(the \u201cNotice of Appeal \u201d) which attaches the 28th Claim Objection Order.  \n6. Trustee raises  two arguments in support of dismissal of the appeal.   Trustee first \nargues that , as a dispositive  threshold issue, Appellant lacks appellate standing which  in \nbankruptcy cases is limited to \u201cperson[s] aggrieved.\u201d  (D.I. 7 at p. 8 ( quoting In re PWS Holding \nCorp., 228 F.3d 224, 249 (3d Cir. 2000) )).  Under controlling Third Circuit precedent, a party \nwill qualify as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d for appellate standing \u201conly if the bankruptcy court\u2019s order \n\u2018diminishes their property, increases their burdens, or impairs their rights.\u2019 . . .  Thus, only those \u2018who se rights or interests are directly and adversely affected pecuniarily by an order of the \nbankruptcy court may bring an appeal.\u2019\u201d  PWS Holding, 228 F.3d at 249.  Because the 28th Claim Objection Order does not in any way diminish Appellant\u2019s property, incr ease her burden , \nor impair her rights with respect to the 28th Claim Objection , Appellant does not qualify as a \n\u201cperson aggrieved\u201d and lacks standing to appeal it.  ( See id . at pp. 7- 10).  4 \n 7. Second, Trustee argue s that the appeal must be dismissed for lack of  subject \nmatter jurisdiction because the appeal was filed  29 days after entry of the 28th Claim Objection \nOrder and thus after the expiration of the 14- day appeal deadline set by Federal Rule of \nBankruptcy Procedure (\u201cBankruptcy Rule\u201d) 8002(a)(1) .  (See D.I. 7 at pp. 10 -11).   \n8. \u201c[Appellant] proceeds pro se , and accordingly, we construe [her] pleadings \nliberally. \u201d  See Laughlin v. Peck, 552 F. App\u2019x 188, 190 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Haines v. Kerner, \n404 U .S. 519, 520- 21 (1972)) .  Notwithstanding this general rule, Appellant\u2019s  requests filed in \nresponse to the Motion to Dismiss are difficult to follow  and attach documents from litigation in \nother jurisdictions .   (See e.g ., D.I. 11 at pp. 8- 12).  The content of Appellant\u2019s  requests do not in \nany way  address either of the Trustee\u2019s  arguments that  Appellant  lacks appellate standing and the \nappeal was untimely.  ( See D.I. 9, 10 ).  Rather, those documents appear  simply  to assert the same \nfacts  presented to the Bankruptcy Court: that Appellant  suffered or suffers economic injuries on \naccount of the product  recall.  ( See id .)   \n9. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review.  The C ourt has appellate jurisdiction over \nall final orders and judgments from the Bankruptcy Court.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) .  \nBankruptcy Rule 8002(a)(1) provides : \u201cExcept as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c), a  notice \nof appeal must  be filed with the  bankruptcy clerk within 14 days after  entry of the judgment, \norder, or decree being appealed.\u201d  Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a) (1).  The Third Circuit has held that \nthe failure to appeal a bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling to the  district court within the time period \nestablished by Bankruptcy Rule  8002 deprives the district court of jurisdiction to hear an appeal.  \nSee In re  Caterbone , 640 F.3d 108, 113 (3d Cir. 2011).   \n10. Discussion.   Although the Bankruptcy R ules alone cannot create or withdraw \njurisdiction, Congress has limited the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from a final \norder of a B ankruptcy C ourt by specifically incorporating the time limits of Rule 8002 in the 5 \n jurisdictional grant to the district courts to hear appeals from bankruptcy courts.  Section \n158(c)(2) of t itle 28 provides that \u201can appeal under subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be \ntaken in the same manner as appeals in civil proceedings generally are taken to the courts of appeals from the district courts and in the time provided by Rule 8002 of the Bankruptcy Rules .\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (c)(2) (emphasis added).  \n11. The Third Circuit has held on several occasions that the time limits of Bankruptcy \nRule 8002 are jurisdictional and deprive an appellate court of subject matter jurisdiction if the appellant f ails to comply.  See Caterbone , 640 F.3d at 112- 13 (citing S\u2019holders v. Sound Radio, \nInc., 109 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1997); Whitemere Dev. Corp ., Inc.  v. Cherry Hill Twp. , 786 F.2d \n185, 187 (3d Cir. 1986); In re Universal Minerals  Inc. 755 F.2d 309, 311 (3d Cir. 1985)).  In \nCaterbone , the court stated that:  \n[b]ecause Section 158 . . . specifies the time within which an appeal must be taken \n\u2013 i.e. , \u201cin the time provided by Rule 8002\u201d \u2013 that requ irement is jurisdictional . . .  \nHere, even though it is a bankruptcy rule that specifies the time within whic h an \nappeal must be filed, the statutory incorporation of that rule renders its requirement statutory and, hence, jurisdictional and non- waivable.  \n \nCaterbone , 640 F.3d at 111 -12. \n12. The Notice of Appeal is untimely and must be dismissed.  The 28\nth Claim \nObjection Order was entered on May 31, 2022, but t he Notice of A ppeal was not filed until June \n29, 2022 \u2013 well after the 14-day deadline.  See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a)(1).   \n13. Conclusion.  While the Court is sympathetic to the challenges of pursuing relief \non a pro se  basis , the jurisdictional defect is non- waivable.  Having failed to file a timely notice \nof appeal, this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and the appeal must be dismissed. 2F3 \n \n3 As the Court is without jurisdiction to consider the appeal, the Court does not  address the lack \nof appellate standing argument set forth in the Motion to Dismiss .  (See D.I. 7 at pp. 7- 10). 6 \n NOW, THEREFORE, it is HEREBY ORDERED that, for the reasons set forth herein, \nthe Trustee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 7) is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED .  \nAccordingly, Appellant\u2019s  Motion for Stay (D.I. 9, 11) and Motion for Default Judgment (D.I. 10, \n12) are DISMISSED  as moot .  The Clerk is directed to CLOSE  the case.  \n \nEntered this 3rd day of January, 2023.  /s/ Richard G. Andrews___ \n      United States District Judge  "}
