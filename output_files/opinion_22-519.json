(D.I. 44)  The Court \nhas reviewed the relevant briefing , (D.I. 49; D.I. 58; D.I. 69; D.I. 77; D.I. 79) , and it heard \nargument during a teleconference held on July 25, 2022, (D.I. 89, hereinafter, \u201c Tr.\u201d).  For the \nreasons that follow, the Court hereby ORDERS that Plaintiff\u2019s Motion is DENIED .  \nWith the Motion, Plaintiff seeks entry of a protective order:   (a) prohibiting Defendant \nPolychem , LLC (\u201cPolychem\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d) from eliciting, receiving or using any of \nPlaintiff\u2019s privileged information that Defendant obtained from  Plaintiff \u2019s former  employee , \nFlavio Finzo (an inventor on two of the patents -in-suit), and requiring Defendant and its counsel \nto disclose any such privileged information already obtained from Mr. Finzo; and (b) prohibiting \nDefendant from eliciting or receiving Plaintiff\u2019s confidential information from Mr. Finzo, or using such information (until produced in this case by Plaintiff).  (D.I. 49 at 1)    \nA motion for a protective order is governed by Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure  26(c) , \nwhich provides that \u201c for good cause ,\u201d the court may \u201c issue an order to protect a party or person \nfrom annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense[.] \u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(c).   Rule 26(c) places the burden of persuasion on the party seeking the protective order, who 2 \n must show good cause by demonstrating, with specificity, a particular need for protection and \nthat absent the protective order, that th e movant will suffer a \u201c clearly defined and serious \ninjury.\u201d   See In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 671 (3d Cir. \n2019)  (internal quotation marks and citation s omitted) ; see also  AbbVie Inc. v. Boehringer \nIngelheim Int \u2019l GmbH, Civil NO. 17- 1065- MSG, 2018 WL 2337133, at *1 (D. Del. May 23, \n2018). \nFirst, w ith regard to Plaintiff\u2019s request as it relates to privileged  information, no good \ncause has been shown.   On the current record, there is no evidence that Defendant has actually \nreceived any privileged information from Mr. Finzo or that it is likely that t his will happen in the \nfuture.   (Tr. at 7)  To the contrary, Defendant\u2019s counsel has stated that:  (a) they have advised \nMr. Finzo not to reveal any such privileged information to them; (b) they have not received any privileged information from Mr. Finzo; and (c) it would be improper for them to attempt to solicit such privileged information, and so they certainly will not be doing so in the future.  (D.I. \n58 at 1; Tr. at 6, 40- 41)  In light of all of this, and in light of the fact that there are rules of \nprofessional conduct that would already seem to prohibit Defendant\u2019s counsel from attempting to obtain this type of information, the Court does not currently see a need to issue a protective order regarding Plaintiff\u2019s privileged information.  Cf. LaPoint v . AmerisourceBergen Corp., No. \nCiv.A. 327- N, 2006 WL 2105862, at *2 (Del. Ch. July 18, 2006) ; Postorivo v. AG Paintball \nHoldings, Inc., Civil Action Nos. 2991- VCP , 3111- VCP , 2008 WL 3876199, at *21 (Del. Ch. \nAug. 20, 2008) .  \nSecond, w ith regard to Plaintif f\u2019s request as it relates to other confidential  information, \nagain, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not demonstrated good cause.  It is not unusual that \na party might wish to \u2014and be permitted to\u2014speak with a former employee of its litigation 3 \n adversary, especially if that former employee has important non- privileged information bearing \non the case (even information that is \u201cconfidential\u201d).   See Valassis v. Samelson, 143 F.R.D. 118, \n119-26 & n.8 (E.D. Mich. 1992); PPG Indus., Inc. v. BASF Corp., 134 F.R.D. 118, 119- 20, 123-\n24 (W.D. Pa. 1990).  While it does not appear disputed that Defendant\u2019s counsel ha s spoken to \nMr. Finzo in the past about the matters at issue in this case, Plaintiff was only able  to identify \none piece of asserted ly confidential information that Mr. Finzo is said to have provided to \nDefendant\u2019s counsel (involving Plaintiff\u2019s actions in disassembling a prior art device many years \nago).  (D.I. 49 at 2; D.I. 58 at 2- 3; Tr. at 9- 10)  And even if Mr. Finzo may have ( or might in the \nfuture ) share certain of Plaintiff\u2019s confidential information with Defendant\u2019s counsel, Plaintiff \nhas failed to explain how , were the Court not to issue a new protective order , this would cause \nPlaintiff  a \u201cclearly defined and serious injury.\u201d   After all, there is a protective order already in \neffect in this case.  (D.I. 26)   And Defendant agrees that any information that is has or will obtain \nfrom Mr. Finzo:   (a) will be treated as \u201chighly confidential\u201d pursua nt to that order; (b) will not be \nshared with Defendant\u2019s employees or any third parties; and (c) if it is to be used in a filing in this case, it will be contained in a document that is at least initially filed under seal.   (Tr. at 32-\n35)  So there seems little to no chance that any such information will later become public in a \nway that will harm Plaintiff.   (Tr. at 14)  And if Plaintiff wants to know what facts Mr. Finzo \nactually did share with Defendant\u2019s counsel, its attorneys can at least ask Mr. Finz o this during \nhis deposition (to the extent that Defendant will object to such questions and assert the \u201ccommon interest privilege,\u201d the Court takes no position now on whether such an assertion would be meritorious).   (D.I. 49 at 1; Tr. at 15- 17, 35)   \nThird, the Court\u2019s decision is not impacted (at least for now) by Plaintiff\u2019s surprising, \npost-argument disclosure that a Swiss Court recently granted a temporary restraining order 4 \n (\u201cTRO \u201d) against Mr. Finzo that prohibits him from \u201c sharing any trade/or manufacturing secrets \nof [Plaintiff], including disclosing any facts in connection with the Asserted Patents, the \nunderlying technologies or the evaluation, testing, development, and commerc ialization thereof \nto [Defendant or its counsel]. \u201d  (D.I. 69 at 1; see also id. , 69-2 at 5)1  For one thing, t he existence \nof this order does not help Plaintiff overcome its above -referenced failure  to demonstrate how it \nwould suffer a clearly defined a nd serious injury were a new protective order not now  entered.  \nMoreover, it is worth noting that \u201c [i]t is well settled that [foreign law, such as foreign blocking \nstatutes, do not necessarily] deprive an American court of the power to order a party subjec t to its \njurisdiction to produce evidence[,] even though the act of production may violate that [law]. \u201d  Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for S. Dist. of Iowa, 482 \nU.S. 522, 544 n.29 (1987);  see also Cadence Pharms., Inc. v. Paddock Labs Inc., No. 11- 733 \n(LPS), D.I. 104 at 25- 29 (D. Del. Mar. 22, 2012) ; Ney v. Owens -Illinois, Inc., CIVIL ACTION \nNO. 16- 2408, 2016 WL 7116015, at *3- 4 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 6, 2016) .  And the Court (at least absent \nfurther briefing on the issue  in the future ) is not inclined to alter discovery procedures in this \ncase in light of the Swiss Court\u2019s issuance of the TRO.  Indeed, the Court is having a hard time seeing how this litigation could reasonably press forward were Mr. Finzo in fact prohibited from \u201cdisclosing any facts in connection with the Asserted Patents\u201d; as an inventor on two of the \npatents -in-suit, his testimony about such facts is likely to be very important in this case.   \nFor these reasons, the Motion is DENIED.  \n  \n \n1   Plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not mention that Plaintiff was seeking such an order during \nthe July 25 teleconference, so news of the order\u2019s issuance was a surprise to the Court.
