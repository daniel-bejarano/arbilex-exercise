Pro Se Plaintiff. \nDaniel A. Griffith, Esquire, Whiteford , Taylor & Preston, L.L.C., Wilmington, Delaware. \nCounsel for Defendant. \nMarch/ '1 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Matthew Jones, who appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis filed this action on May 13, 2019. (D.I. 2). The matter \nproceeds on the Amended Complaint. (D.I. 8). Before the Court are the parties' cross \nmotions for summary judgment. (D.I. 59, 60). Briefing is complete . \nBACKGROUND AND FACTS PRESENTED BY THE PARTIES \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that on November 1, 2017, 1 Defendant Officer \nWilliam Thomas, an employee of the municipality of the Town of Greenwood , Delaware , \nand others searched Plaintiff and his home without a warrant; that after Defendant \nasked Plaintiff several questions he determined that Plaintiff was a threat to himself and \nothers and \"judged\" Plaintiff as having schizophrenia ; and that Defendant removed \nPlaintiff from his home and transported Plaintiff to the Nanticoke Hospital where \nDefendant recommended that Plaintiff be involuntarily held and medicated. (D. I. 8 at 1, \n4-5). The Court liberally construed the Amended Complaint upon screening and \ndetermined that it alleged what appeared to be a Fourth Amendmen t warrantless search \nand seizure claim of Plaintiff and his home pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (See D.I. 9 \nat 6, D.I. 10). \nOn November 9, 2017, the Greenwood Police Department received a telephone \ncomplaint that Plaintiff was trespassing at the Woodbridge Early Childhood Education \n1 Plaintiff refers to November 1, 2017 as the relevant date (D.I. 1, ,J 4), and Defendant \nrefers to November 17, 2017 as the relevant date in his motion for summary judgment \n(D.I. 61 at 1 ). The reports submitted to the court indicate the incident complained of \noccurred on November 9, 2017. (D.I. 62 (two police reports) & D.I. 67 (Initial Behavioral \nHealth Assessment)) . \n1 Center and taking photographs through the building's windows. (D.I. 62 at 4). While \nat the school, Plaintiff came into contact with Paula Steele, her spouse, and child. (Id.). \nThomas responded to the call and checked the area \"with negative contact with Jones.\" \n(Id.). \nThat evening, Plaintiff posted comments on his public Facebook account that \nresulted in reports to the Greenwood Police Department. (Id. at 6-8). Due to concerns \nregarding the nature of the complaints , the Greenwood Police Department contacted \nMobile Crisis lntervention .2 (Id.) Mobile Crisis agreed that it was appropriate to make \ncontact with Plaintiff and advised the Greenwood Police Department that it would not go \nto Plaintiffs residence alone due to past experiences with Plaintiff. (Id.). Police \nOfficers from the Delaware State Police, Bridgeville Police Department , and Greenwood \nPolice Department met with Mobile Crisis at a Royal Farms and, together, went to the \nresidence . (Id.). \nOfficers arrived at Plaintiffs residence around 9:00 p.m. (Id. at 5). Plaintiffs \nmother, Ms. Jones signed a notarized , but unsworn, statement that she did not give \nDefendant permission to enter her house and told him not to come into her house. \n(D.I. 66 at 4). Ms. Jones does not specify which time she is discussing, but, giving the \npro se Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, I assume it is the relevant time. Defendant \n2 The Delaware Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health offers crisis \nintervention services, twenty-four hours a day to assist people, eighteen years and \nolder, with \"severe personal\" problems including \"thoughts of suicide, delusions , \nparanoia and substance abuse.\" \"[C]risis staff work in conjunction with every police \ndepartment throughout the state, ... [including] assisting in the evaluation of persons \npicked up on criminal charges who may require mental health evaluations and who may \nbe appropriate for the State's Mental Health Courts.\" See https://www .dhss.de1aware \n.gov/dsamh/crisis _intervention.html (last visited March 8, 2022). \n2 states that Plaintiffs mother gave permission to enter the home. (D.I. 31 at 25, ,I 11 ). \nDefendant states that probable cause existed to enter the home for multiple reasons \nincluding the threats made by Plaintiff on social media and the threat of harm to \nhimself/and or others. (Id. at 24, ,I 8). \nOnce the officers were inside the home, Plaintiff recorded the incident and \nstreamed it on Facebook Live. (D.I. 62 at 6; 0.1. 65). The video recording is about six \nminutes long and (for reasons that are not explained) has a date of November 10, 2017 \nat 2:26 a.m. (D.I. 65). The video depicts Plaintiff moving from a hallway into the \nkitchen, Plaintiff speaking to the officers, Plaintiff being questioned about his mental \nwell-being by Mobile Crisis, Plaintiff being informed by Mobile Crisis that he was being \nplaced on a \"twenty-four hour detention for impaired mental condition, \" and Plaintiff \nstating that he would \"honor that.\" (D.I. 65). Mobile Crisis advised Plaintiff that he \nwould undergo a 24-hour emergency psychiatric medical evaluation, and he was taken \ninto custody. ( 0.1. 62 at 6). Defendant states that he did not make the decision to \ntake Plaintiff into custody and does not know who did. (D.I. 31 at 25 ,I 10). \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nRule 56(c) requires the court to \"grant summary judgment if the movant shows \nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.\" The moving party bears the burden of demonstrat ing the \nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. \nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86 (1986). A fact in dispute is material when it \n\"might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law\" and is genuine \"if the \nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" \n3 Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \"In considering a motion for \nsummary judgment, a district court may not make credibility determinations or engage in \nany weighing of the evidence; instead, the nonmoving party's evidence 'is to be \nbelieved and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\"' Marino v. Industrial \nCrating Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Anderson , 477 U.S. at 255). A \ncourt's role in deciding a motion for summary judgment is not to evaluate the evidence \nand decide the truth of the matter but rather \"to determine whether there is a genuine \nissue for trial.\" Anderson , 477 U.S. at 249. \nAs a general rule, the court must \"draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nnonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence. \" \nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). \nWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to \nfind for the nonmoving party, there is no \"genuine issue for trial.\" The \nmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will \nnot defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment ; \nthe requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact. When \nopposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly \ncontradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a \ncourt should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a \nmotion for summary judgment. \nScott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) (citations, quotations , and alterations omitted). \nThe same standards and burdens apply on cross-motions for summary judgment. See \nAppelmans v. City of Philadelphia , 826 F.2d 214,216 (3d Cir. 1987). \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiff moves for summary judgment on all claims he initially raised. The only \nclaim that remains is the Fourth Amendment claim and, therefore, his motion is \nconstrued as seeking summary judgment for that claim only. In his motion, Plaintiff \n4 details his mother's description of what happened when police arrived on November 9, \n2017. (D.I. 59 at 8). However, the only statement in the record from Ms. Jones is that \nshe did not give permission to police officers to enter her home and, therefore , the \ndescription is not considered . Plaintiff also relies upon the video that he recorded. (Id. \nat 11 ). He states, \"in my video of my arrest, police officers can be seen searching my \nhouse ... they did not have a warrant ... it was after midnight. \" (Id.). \nDefendant moves for summary judgment on the grounds that he is entitled to \nqualified immunity as he did not violate Plaintiffs constitutional rights, Ms. Jones gave \npermission to enter the home and, in the alternative, exigent circumstances existed to \njustify entry into the residence . (D.I. 61 at 7-11). \nSummary judgment is not appropriate for either party. Both sides present their \narguments in at best a conclusory and unconvincing fashion. There may or may not be \na genuine issue of fact whether Plaintiffs mother gave consent to enter the premises . \nPlaintiff states that no permission was given to enter the home and therefore, the entry \nwas unlawful, while Defendant contends that Plaintiffs mother gave permission to enter \nthe home and the warrantless entry was lawful. Plaintiffs argument depends upon a \ncursory and somewhat ambiguous statement from his mother. She has not been \ndeposed. Defendant's argument depends upon unsworn police reports and his own \nconclusory Interrogatory response . He has not been deposed. Defendant argues in \nthe alternative that exigent circumstances existed to justify entry into the residence . \nThe \"exigent\" nature of the circumstances is presented conclusorily . Thus, the record \nevidence is insufficient for this Court to conclude that such circumstances existed. \nTherefore , both motions will be denied. \n5 The Court thinks it would be in the interests of justice to reopen discovery so that \ndepositions or other discovery relevant to whether there was consent, whether the entry \ntook place at about 9 p.m. or after midnight, and whether there was a search and, if so, \nwhat kind of search it was and what the justification for it was. A new dispositive \nmotion deadline will be set. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will deny the parties' cross-motions for \nsummary judgment (D.I. 59, D.I. 60). \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nMATTHEW JONES, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nOFFICER WILLIAM THOMAS , \nDefendant. : Civil Action No. 19-896-RGA \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 16th day of March, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum \nOpinion issued this date; \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment (D.I. 59) is DENIED. \n2. Defendant's motion for summary judgment (0.1. 60) is DENIED. \n3. Discover is reopened for the limited purpose of discovery of relevant facts \nto the issues in the case and shall be initiated so that it will be completed on or \nbefore June 15, 2022. Any renewed case dispositive motion, an opening brief, \nand affidavits and/or declarations , if any, in support of the motion, shall be served \nand filed on or before July 15, 2022. No case dispositive motion under Rule 56 \nmay be filed more than ten days before the above date without leave of the \nCourt. "}
