Williford , THE WILLIFORD FIRM LLC, Wilmington , DE. \nAttorney for Plaintiff .. \nVictoria Sweeney, Kenneth Lee-Kay Wan, DELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF WSTICE , \nWilmington , DE. \nAttorneys for Defendant. \nNovember 12021 Plaintiff Kevin Howard, an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center (\"JTVCC\") \nin Smyrna, Delaware , commenced this action on Oct. 31, 2017 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. \n2). In the operative complaint , he alleges that Michael Little unconstitutionally retaliated against \nhim by not hiring him for a job opening in September 2015 in the JTVCC law library. (D.I. 22 ,r,r \n28). \nHoward moved that a lawyer be appointed to represent him at the bench trial. (D.I. 88). \nI granted the motion and appointed counsel. 1 There were two days of testimony (D.I. 121; D.I. \n122, hereinafter referred to as \"Tr.\"), a post-trial brief (D.I. 116), closing argument , a supplemental \nevidentiary submission (D.I. 119), and a letter in response to the supplemental evidentiary \nsubmission (D.I. 120). My findings of fact and conclusions oflaw follow. \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nLittle was the Legal Services Administrator at JTVCC from 2002 to 2019. (Tr. 216:7-9). \nAs Legal Services Administrator , Little was responsible for hiring inmates to work in the JTVCC \nlaw libraries. (Tr. 249: 18-21 ). Inmates were informed of open positions via physical postings on \nthe windows of the law library and broadcasted announcements on JTVCC's internal TV \ninformation channel. (Tr. 223:22-24; 224:12-23). Inmates applied by submitting letters of interest. \n(Tr. 224:3-9). Little would then review the letters, select a pool of applicants to interview , and \nmake a hiring decision based on the interviews. (Tr. 224:5-9). \nIn September 2013, Howard wrote Little a letter requesting a job in the law library. (Tr. \n166:19-20). Little responded with a memorandum dated Sept. 24, 2013, informing Howard he \nwould not be considered for the position because (1) he had not been \"write-up free for a period \n1 I thank appointed counsel, Evan Williford , for his diligent representation of Plaintiff. \n1 of one year prior to hiring,\" and (2) he was not \"currently employed\" and did not \"possess the \neducation/experience that would qualify [him] to be hired immediatel y.\" (DTX 3). Howard saved \na copy of Little's memorandum. \nIn the Fall of 2014, Howard, along with another inmate, filed an action in the Delaware \nCourt of Chancery against three Delaware Department of Correction (\"DOC\") officials-the \nCommissioner of the Department of Correction , the Chief of the Bureau of Prisons, and the \nWarden of the JTVCC. (Tr. 182:16-20 ; see Hall v. Coupe, 2016 WL 3094406 (Del. Ch. May 25, \n2016)). Little was not named as a defendant. \nNearly a year later, in a letter dated July 9, 2015, Howard wrote to Little to inquire about a \njob in the law library, referring specificall y to Little's Sept. 24, 2013, memorandum , and informing \nLittle he had since earned a certification of completion in a paralegal course. (DTX 4). Howard \nmade a handwritten copy of this letter, which he had stamped \"Received July 10, 2015 Hearing \nOffice Clerk.\" Little responded again with a memorandum , dated July 15, 2015, informing \nHoward there were \"currently no positions available.\" (DTX 5). Howard saved copies of both of \nthese documents. \nSometime around September 2015, an inmate law clerk position became available in the \nlaw library. (Tr. 173:9-12). Howard claims he submitted yet another letter of application for that \nposition on Sept. 8, 2015, and produced a purported handwritten copy of that letter as evidence in \nthis case. (Tr. 173 :9-17; PTX 6). Although he received written responses the previous two times \nhe submitted letters applying for the position (i.e., DTX 3; DTX 5), Howard testified that on this \noccasion he did not. (Tr. 128:11-12). Unlike the handwritten copy of his July 2015 letter of \napplication , Howard's copy of his September 2015 letter is not stamped as \"received\" by the \nJTVCC Hearing Office Clerk. (Tr. 171:18-25, 172:24-25, 173:1-6; DTX 4; PTX 6). \n2 Little does not remember Howard applying for the September 2015 position and testified \nhe did not recognize the copy of the Sept. 8, 2015 letter produced by Howard. (Tr. 236:20-22, \n237:6-18). Little conducted some interviews and hired an inmate named William Hudson for the \nposition. (D.I. 98 at 4; Tr. 236:11-19, 305:13-21 ). Howard testified that sometime after he \nsubmitted the letter, upon learning that Hudson had been hired for the position, he talked with \nLittle about why he had not been hired. (Tr. 128:6-25). Howard claims Little told him he had not \nbeen considered for the position because he had litigation pending against DOC.2 (Tr. 128:6-25, \n198: 1-12). Little does not remember any such conversation. (Tr. 310: 19-25, 311: 1-11 ). \nShortly thereafter , on Nov. 2, 2015, Howard filed Grievance No. 322637. (PTX 10). The \nGrievance was summarized as, \"[Howard] claims that Michael Little has imple[me]nted rules for \nworking in the Law Library that usurp the authority of the hiring officer and he wants a fair chance \nto move up, and is prevented from doing so. He wants sen[i]ority on list put first regardless of \nlawsuits against DOC.\" (PTX 10 at D000146) . The part of Howard's Grievance written by \nHoward is five pages long. (Id. at D000150-D000154). The Grievance , while consistent with \nHoward's trial testimony about Little having a policy of not hiring inmates with litigation against \nDOC (Id at D000150-D000151 , D000153) , is inconsistent with the testimony that he applied for \nthe September 2015 vacancy announcement. \n2 Another inmate, Robert Carroll, testified, reluctantl y, that he overhead this conversation between \nHoward and Little. (Tr. 22:2-16). After some coaxing and leading by Plaintiffs counsel, Carroll \neventually testified that he heard Little tell Howard he could not hire him because he had \"active \nlitigation. \" (Id.). I have no confidence in Carroll's testimony. While it is quite plausible that Carroll \ndid not want to testify, and it is plausible that he feared retaliation , I am unpersuaded that Carroll's \nfear was of retaliation from prison officials. Retaliation in prison can come from prison officials \nor other inmates. \n3 In his Grievance , Howard asserts, \"Mich[ ae ]l Little did not assign the open job position in \nthe law library to me because I have filed a civil action against the DOC\" (Id. at D000150) , but he \ndoes not mention ever applying for the September 2015 opening specifically. He explains that he \napplied for the law clerk position in 2013 but was not considered because he had not satisfied all \nof Little's stated criteria for the position, and then says he applied again in \"early 2015,\" but was \ntold \"no job position was open.\" (Id. at D000152(b) ). He then says, \"In September 2015 another \nlaw library position becomes open,\" (Id. at D000152(d)-D000153) but does not mention applying \nagain for the open position. Instead, a fair reading of his Grievance suggests Howard believed that \nthe September 2015 position should have been automatically offered to him due to his seniority in \nthe work pool list. Indeed, all three of the \"Actions\" Howard requests in his Grievance are \nconsistent with that expectation: \n1. \"That I be assigned the job position not filled in the law library; there are 6 positions for \nan inmate worker in the law library, only 5 is occupied. \" (Id. at D000150 ). \n2. \"That sen[i]ority on the work pool list be followed if there is not an algorithm in the \ncomputer to keep the work pool list in order as the names are added, then one should be \ncreated.\" (Id. at D000150 , D000154) \n3. \"Those on the work pool's list that have a job assignment , when their names come up \nbecause of their sen[i]ority on the work pool list for a job or to fill a job vacancy they \nshould be asked if they want the position available, and if not, then consideration goes to \nthe next person on the list.\" (Id. at D000154). \nHoward alleges that Little did not consider him for the September 2015 open law library \nposition because he had a lawsuit pending against DOC and that Little's hiring decision was \ntherefore illegal retaliation , in violation of his First Amendment rights. (DJ. 22 ,r,r 28). \n4 II. LEGAL STANDARD \nTo prevail under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \"a prisoner alleging retaliation must show (1) \nconstitutionally protected conduct, (2) an adverse action by prison officials sufficient to deter a \nperson of ordinary firmness from exercising his constitutional rights, and (3) a causal link between \nthe exercise of his constitutional rights and the adverse action taken against him \" Sloan v. \nPennsylvania Dep 't of Corr., 800 F. App'x 143, 148 (3d Cir. 2020) (cleaned up). Filing a state \ncourt lawsuit is constitutionally protected conduct. Milhouse v. Carlson, 652 F.2d 371, 373 (3d \nCir. 1981). \nThe causation element usually3 requires a plaintiff to prove \"either: (1) an unusually \nsuggestive temporal proximity between the protected activity and the allegedly retaliatory action, \nor (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing that suggests a causal link.\" Watson v. Rozum, \n834 F.3d 417, 422 (3d Cir. 2016); Brant v. Varano, 717 F. App'x 146, 149-51 (3d Cir. 2017). \n\"[O]nce a prisoner demonstrates that his exercise of a constitutional right was a substantial or \nmotivating factor in the challenged decision, the prison officials may still prevail by proving that \nthey would have made the same decision absent the protected conduct for reasons reasonably \nrelated to a legitimate penological interest.\" Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 334 (3d Cir. 2001). \nThe plaintiff has the burden of proving his retaliation claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by a \npreponderance of the evidence. Brooks v. Smith, 2007 WL 3275266, at* 1 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 6, 2007). \n3 I say \"usually\" because her~ Plaintiff offers direct evidence (i.e., Little's purported policy against \nhiring inmates with pending lawsuits against DOC); usually a plaintiff relies only upon \ncircumstantial evidence. See Watson v. Rozum, 834 F.3d at 422 (\"Because motivation is almost \nnever subject to proof by direct evidence,\" inmates \"must rely on circumstantial evidence to prove \na retaliatory motive.\"). \n5 Thus, Howard must demonstrate it is \"more likely than not\" that he has proved the elements of his \nclaim. Johnson v. Organo Gold Int'! Inc., 146 F. Supp. 3d 590, 593 (D. Del. 2015). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Constitutionally Protected Conduct \nThe parties agree that Howard's lawsuit against DOC is constitutionally protected conduct. \n(Tr. 7:23-25). Thus, the first element of the retaliation standard is satisfied. \nB. Adverse Action/Causation4 \nHoward contends that he suffered an adverse action at the hands of prison officials when \nLittle did not hire him for the September 2015 inmate law clerk opening. A prison official's failure \nJo hire an inmate for a job opening for which he applied would q__ualify as_an adverse action ____ _ \n\"sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his constitutional rights.\" A \nprison official's failure to hire an inmate for a job opening for which he did not apply would not. \nThus, to satisfy the adverse action element of his retaliation claim, Howard must show that he both \n(1) applied for the position and (2) was not hired for the position. \nHere, the expected and usual method of applying for the position of inmate law clerk was \nto submit a letter of interest in response to a posted opening. (Tr. 224:3-9). Little's testimony on \nthis point is corroborated by the fact that on at least two previous occasions, in 2013 and July 2015, \nHoward himself applied via letter. While Howard argues that on at least one occasion an inmate \n4 At closing argument , the parties disputed whether the issue of whether Howard applied for the \njob was properly addressed under the \"adverse action\" or the \"causation \" elements. Plaintiff \nstated Defendant had stipulated to there being an \"adverse action\" in the pretrial order. (See D.I. \n98 at 8). Defendant responded that he certainly disputed whether Howard had applied for the job. \n(See id. at 6). Both parties have a point. Not being hired is an \"adverse action.\" When the argument \nis whether the person applied for the job, it seems to me the analysis is going to be the same \nwhether it is considered under the \"adverse action\" or as a part of the \"causation \" element. \n6 was hired without having submitted a letter, Little's testimony on the special circumstances \nsurrounding that occasion suggest it was anomalous , and that, normally , a letter would be required \nfor a candidate to be considered. (See Tr. 307:12-19 , 308:3-18). Little also testified that, due to \nfrequent inmate turnover, he did not hold applications from previous postings to be considered for \nfuture openings. (Tr. 235:5-25, 236:1-3). Howard did not present any evidence suggesting that \nholding old applications to be reviewed for future openings was a common practice by Little ( or \nby anyone else) at JTVCC. Therefore , to show that he applied, Howard must prove he submitted \nan application specificall y regarding the September 2015 opening. \nThe evidence presented at trial shows that, more likely than not, Howard did not submit a \nletter applying for the September 2015 position. Thus, I find that Howard has not met his burden \nin proving he suffered an adverse action, because he did not apply for the position. \nAs part of his First Request for Admissions , Howard produced three documents he \nconsidered relevant to his suit for Little to verify. These were: \n\u2022 Little's Sept. 24, 2013 memorandum explaining why Howard was not being considered for \na position in the law library at that time (i.e., DTX 3), \n\u2022 A stamped copy of Howard's handwritten July 9, 2015 letter to Little requesting a position \nin the law library (i.e., DTX 4), and \n\u2022 Little's July 15, 2015 memorandum informing Howard there were no open positions in the \nlaw library at that time (i.e., DTX 5). \n(D.I. 37, Requests 26-29, docketed Nov. 6, 2019 Tr. 175:10-13). \nHoward did not produce a copy of his purported September 2015 letter of application until \nafter he was deposed for this lawsuit on Dec. 4, 2019. (Tr. 175:10-25; 176:1-12; see D.I. 41). The \nonly explanation Howard gave at trial for why he did not include that letter with his initial \n7 production of relevant documents was that he \"forgot.\" (Tr. 176:11-14) . Howard offered no \nexplanation for why the copy of his September 2015 letter was not stamped as received like the \ncopy of his July 2015 letter. Finally, in the Grievance Howard filed in November 2015 regarding \nLittle's hiring practices , he references the three exhibits (DTX 3; DTX 4; DTX 5) that he later \nproduced when he made his First Request for Admissions . (PTX 10 at D000152(b) & (d)). He does \nnot even obliquely hint at any application letter from September 2015. (Id. at D000152-D000153). \nThe combined weight of (1) Little's testimony that he did not recognize Howard's \nSeptember 2015 letter, (2) Howard's delay in producing the letter, (3) the letter's lack of a \n\"received\" stamp, ( 4) the absence of any memorandum from Little acknowledging receipt of the \napplication , and (5) Howard's failure to mention the letter in the Grievance he filed on the subject \nof, and nearly contemporaneously with, the events at issue here, suggests that, more likely than \nnot, Howard did not submit a letter of application in September 2015. Because Howard has not \nproven that he applied for the September 2015 position, he has not shown that he suffered an \nadverse action and, consequentl y, has not met his burden in proving his retaliation claim. \nPlaintiff argues, in the alternative, that even if he did not specifically apply for the vacancy \nin September 2015, Little's failure to hire him for the opening was still an adverse action, because \non at least one previous occasion, Little had hired an inmate law clerk without requiring an \napplication. This argument is unconvincing . As discussed above, on the one occasion Little \nremembered hiring an inmate without an application , the hiring decision was made under unique \ncircumstances. 5 The testimony makes clear that the hiring without an application was because \n5 Little testified that on one occasion, he agreed to hire an inmate who had previously been \nemployed in the JTVCC chapel without requiring an application from the inmate, explaining , \n\"They contacted me and they wanted to get him out of the chapel and asked me if I would give \nhim a job in the Law Library.\" (Tr. 308:8-14). \n8 some other JTVCC official or officials wanted a place to put an inmate. There is no resemblance \nto Howard's current argument, which is that Little on his own initiative should have hired him \nwithout an application. \nHoward argues that Robert Carroll was also hired without submitting an application. At \ntrial, however, Carroll merely testified that he could not \"recall\" writing a letter or memo to apply \nsix years ago. (Tr. 17:23-25, 18:1-3). I do not consider that a sufficient basis to find that Carroll \nwas hired without an application . Even assuming Carroll was hired without an application , \nhowever, Carroll's situation would have been different. He had been employed previously in the \nlaw library. (Tr. 17:7-25, 18:1-6). His work product would have been known, and there might \nhave been reasons why Little knew or suspected that he wanted to come back. \nAt most, these two examples (assuming that the second was proven) support a finding that \nhiring inmates who had not submitted applications was the exception, not the rule. They would not \noffer anything to support Howard's argument that he should have been considered even though he \nhad not applied. \nFinally, Howard did not offer any evidence at trial to suggest that an automatic work pool \nassignment system like the one he requested in his Grievance was followed or had ever existed in \nthe law library. In the absence of such evidence and in the absence of any evidence suggesting \nthere was a practice to hold old applications for future consideration , I am not persuaded that \nHoward was an applicant for the job that went to Hudson, and therefore Howard did not suffer an \nadverse action when he was not hired. Or, stated differently , any unconstitutional policies that \nLittle carried out were unrelated to, and therefore not the cause of, Howard not getting the job. \n9 C. Causation \nThe causation analysis ( or the remainder of the causation analysis, if the above adverse \naction analysis is more properly considered to be causation analysis) is moot, as Howard has not \nshown he suffered an adverse action. 6 \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, I find that Plaintiff has not proven his claim of retaliation under 42 \nU.S.C .. \u00a7_ 1983. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n6 I nevertheless reaffirm two findings that I made, or strongly hinted at, during the trial. \nOne, Howard had the burden to prove damages. Since he had a higher paying job (or jobs) \nin September 2015 than the law library job, and he continued to hold the higher paying job(s) at \nleast through the end of 2016 (DTX 8), he proved no actual lost wages damages. \nTwo, Hudson applied for the job and Howard did not. If I had found that Howard had \napplied for the job, and that First Amendment retaliation was the reason he was not considered for \nthe job, Defendant offered no meaningful proof that Hudson was better qualified for the job than \nHoward, or even that he was as qualified , and I would have to find that Defendant failed to show \nthat Hudson would have gotten the job even if Howard had been fully and fairly considered. \n10 "}
