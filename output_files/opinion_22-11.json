For the reasons discussed below, after de novo review of Defendant\u2019s \ndetention, the request for release is DENIED.   \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn February 1, 2022, a grand jury in the District of Delaware returned an Indictment  \ncharging the D efendant and three co -defendants with conspiracy to commit money laundering in  \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h).  After  being unable to locate D efendant for several months, he \nwas arrest ed in the Southern District of  Indiana on or about May 12, 2022.  He had  an initial \nappearance in that district the next day.  See United States v. Lawal , No. 22- mj-425-TAB  (S.D. \nInd.) (\u201cthe S.D. Ind. Case \u201d), D.I. 1.  A contested detention hearing was held before  Magistrate \nJudge Mark J. Dinsmore on May 24, 2022.1  After hearing the proffers and arguments of the \n \n1  A transcript of that hearing was attached as Exhibit 1 to the defendant's motion. ( See \nD.I. 75-1 (hereinafter \u201cTr.\u201d)).  2 parties, the magistrate court granted the  government \u2019s motion.  See Exhibit A (S.D. Ind. Case \nD.I. 11 ( detention order)).  The magistrate jud ge based  his decision on the millions of dollars that \nflowed through bank accounts the D efendant controlled, his significant ties to Nigeria, his lack of \nlegitimate employment history, his lack of a stable  residence, and his past use of an alias. (T r. \nat 19:11- 21 :5) .  After his transfer to the District of Delaware, the D efendant filed the instant \nmotion.  (D.I. 75).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nPursuant to the Bail Reform Act , a court must detain a defendant if it finds that either \n(a) there is clear and convincing  evidence that no combination of conditions will ensure the safety \nof the community if he is  released, or (b) a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that no \ncombination of conditions  will ensure the appearance of the defendant as required.  18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 3142(e) & (f); see also  United States v. Him ler, 797 F.2d 156, 161 (3d Cir. 1986) (holding that \nthe standard for  determining whether the defendant is a risk of non- appearance under \u00a7 3142(e) is \na \u201cpreponderance  of the evidence \u201d). \nThere are four statutory factors that a court must consider in determining whether the  \ndefendant should be detained pending trial under \u00a7 3142: ( 1) the nature and circumstances of the  \noffense charged, (2) the w eight of the evidence against the person, (3) the history and  \ncharacteristics of the person, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the  \ncommunity that would be posed by the person \u2019s release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3142(g)(l) -(4).  In \nconsi dering those factors, the court is not bound by the \u201c rules concerning the admissibility of  \nevidence. \u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f).  \u201c[E]ither party may proceed by proffer  and the rules of evidence \ndo not apply.\u201d   United States v. El -Hage , 213 F.3d 74, 82 (2d Cir. 2000). \nIf detained by a magistrate judge, a defendant may appeal to the district court.  18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3145(b). A district court \u2019s review is de novo , although it may rely on the evidence presented  3 before the magistrate judge without conducting another heari ng.  United States v. Delker , 757 F.2d \n1390, 1394- 95 (3d Cir. 1985); United States v. Koenig, 912 F.2d 1190, 1192 (9th Cir. 1990).  \u201c In \nmost cases the district court will find it useful to consider carefully the decision and reasoning of \nthe magistrate. \u201d  Delker , 757 F.2d at 1395.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThe Court considers each of the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g) in turn.  The facts \nrecited are those proffered by the parties at  the contested hearing, the current motion papers , and \nthe PS3.  \nA. Section 3142(g)(l)  \u2013 the Nature and Circumstance of the Offense  \nThe Defendant is an important member of an international  organization based in West \nAfrica (\u201c the criminal organization \u201d) that ob tains  and then launders  millions of dollars derived from \ninternet -based fraud such as romance scams  and business email compromises.2  The perpetrators \nof those crimes are spread across the United  States and the world, including in Nigeria where the \nDefend ant has strong ties.  The victims of  those crimes are both individuals and businesses.  Many \nof the individuals who fell prey to the  romance fraud perpetrated by this criminal organization are \nelderly victims who lost their life \u2019s savings to the fraud.  \nOver the course of the D efendant \u2019s involvement in the conspiracy, he personally received  \nor deposited more than $3 million into bank accounts opened in his name and in the names  of his \nbusiness entities, Luxe Logistics LLC and Yankee Imports.  The Governme nt believes that the \nentirety of those proceeds are tied  to the internet -based fraud perpetrated by the criminal \n \n2  The government does not contend currently that the D efendant was individually \nperpetrating the internet -based fraud.  Rather, it asserts that unknown co- conspirators \nthroughout the world perpetrated the fraud and the D efendant was a recipient of the \nfraudulently obtained proceeds and an integral part of the criminal organization\u2019 s efforts \nto launder those proceeds.  (D.I. 78 at 2, n.1).  4 organization.  More than $2 million of the  deposits were withdrawn in cash and rema in largely \nunaccounted for.    \nThe Defendant \u2019s importance in  the criminal organization is demonstrated by the fact that \nhe received money directly from defrauded victims as well as from lower- ranking members of the \ncriminal organization.   It is believe that, as a higher -ranking member of the organization, \nDefendant  received a \u201ccut\u201d of the fraudulently obtained proceeds  and, after taking that \u201ccut,\u201d \nhelped to launder the proceeds and repatriat e the funds to West Africa largely by purchasing cars \nwith the fraudulent  proceeds and shipping them overseas to other members  of the criminal \norganization.  \nThe criminal organization apparently has obtained  and use d fraudulent identification and \ntravel documents to aid in its internet- based fraud  and money laundering efforts.  The Government \nproffers that  the organization has obtained  false state driver \u2019s licenses  and false passports, both to \ncreate the online personas used to perpetrate its romance scams and to  register shell business \nentities and open bank accounts under untraceable aliases.  (D.I. 78 at 5).    \nIn short, t he nature of the criminal organization and its crimes has provided Defendant with \nresources to flee from prosecution.  Defendant, either personally or through his co- conspirators , \nhas access to millions of dollars, fraudulent travel documents, and co- conspira tors located across \nthe country and the world.  Moreover, the Defendant, who is not an American citizen, appears to \nbe facing a substantial guidelines term of incarceration and likely deportation.3  The combination \n \n3  The Defendant faces a 20 -year statutory maximum term of imprisonment, see 18 U.S.C. \n1956 \u00a7\u00a7 (a)(l) & (h), and the  government \u2019s conservative guidelines \u2019 calculation results in \na guidelines sentence that exceeds ten years.   (D.I. 78 at 5).   5 of the lengthy sentence facing the D efendant and his likely deportation provides the D efendant \nwith a strong incentive to flee prosecution.4 \nB. Section 3142(g)(2)  \u2013 the Weight of the Evidence  \nThe two -year investigation into the criminal organization uncovered substantial evidence \nagainst the D efendant.  Bank records show that he opened numerous bank accounts in his own \nname and in the name of his business , Luxe Logistics LLC.   (PS3 at 1) .5  The records show that \nover three years, he deposited more than $3 million , most of which was procured by the  criminal \norganization through internet -based fraud.   The bank records apparently demonstrate transactions \nbetween the Defendant and (i) his co- defendants in this  case, (ii) other individuals facing similar \ncharges in other districts, and (iii) unindicted coconspirators.  (D.I. 78 at 6).  Nothing in the bank \nrecords suggest any legitimate source for those funds.  ( Id.). \nAdditionally, witnesses have attested to Defendant\u2019s involvement in the criminal \norganization, including his role in using the c riminal proceeds to purchase cars to send overseas. \nThose witnesses, moreover, are purportedly corroborated by text messages that show one of the \nco-defendant \u2019s instructing  another co -defendant to send the D efendant tens of thousands of dollars \nthrough com mercial  shipping services and by financial records that show the D efendant \u2019s active \ninvolvement in purchasing cars.   (D.I. 78 at 7).   \n \n4  One member of the same criminal organization to which the D efendant belongs pleaded \nguilty in this District in October 2021.   See United States v. Kuye , No. 20 -cr-57 (D. Del.). \nThat defendant, a citizen of Nigeria who likewise was facing a lengthy prison sentence and \nlikely deportation, failed to appear for his sentencing in February 2022 and has not been located since despite th e fact that he had surrendered his travel documents as part of his \npre-trial release.   (D.I. 78 at 6, n.2).  \n \n5  The government understands that, given the personally identifying information contained in that document, defense counsel submitted the PS3 dire ctly to the Court and did not file \nit on the public docket as an exhibit. 6 The proffer of bank records in the D efendant \u2019s name irrefutably showing his receipt of \nfraud proceeds  coupled with the le ngth of time the D efendant actively engaged in this criminal \nconspiracy indicates that Defendant was an active participant in the activities of the criminal \norganization.  \nC. Section 3142(g)(3)  \u2013 the Defendant \u2019s History and Characteristics  \nThis factor consider s, among other things, \u201c the person\u2019 s character, physical and mental  \ncondition, family ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in the community, \ncommunity ties, [and] past conduct[.] \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)(3)(A).  Here, the D efendant \u2019s hist ory \nand characteristics, including his strong ties to Nigeria, recent trips overseas, access to money and \nfalse identification documents, his education, and his past evasive conduct, all suggest the means, wherewithal, and incentive to flee from prosecution. \nDefendant is a 31 -year-old Nigerian citizen.  He arrived in the United States in 2015 and \nis currently a lawful permanent resident of this country.  The Defendant, however, has maintain ed \nstrong family ties to Nigeria.  He has regular contact with his mother who live s in Nigeria , where \nthe leaders of the criminal organization  are located .  His brother also remains in Nigeria.  \nDefendant \u2019s family life in Indiana, moreover, appears unsettled.  The Defendant is divorcing his  \nwife with  whom he shares one child.  At the time of his arrest, the D efendant was living with a \ndifferent  woman, who reports that she is imminently expecting (or recently had) a child with the \nDefendant.   The nature of that relationship is unclear, given that both the D efendant and the  woman \ntold a  United States Probation Officer in Indiana that she and the D efendant were \u201c only friends,\u201d  \n(PS3 at 1 -2), despite the woman later writing a letter to this Court describing their relationship as \n\u201cromantic \u201d (D.I. 7 5-2 at p.1). \nDefendant has made at least four overseas  trips over the past two years.  Those trips appear \nto include two extended trips to Nigeria, as well as two short trips to Cancun, Mexico.   As noted 7 already, Defendant has access to an un- identified amount of money that he could use to flee from \nprosecution, including up to $2 million dollars in cash withdrawals remain largely  unaccounted \nfor as well as potential money from co -conspirators  looking to help him.  \nThat the Defendant has off ered to surrender his passport does not address the issue \nsufficiently.  As noted above, the criminal organization is known to obtain false identification and \ntravel  documents.  Moreover, the government proffers that other individuals who have been \nindicte d in this District and others who have ties to this criminal organization have already fled \nprosecution despite surrendering their travel documents.  And the concern that the D efendant  \nwould obtain suspect identification documents or assume an alias is not  merely hypothetical.  The \nGovernment has proffered that Defendant attempted to obtain a Texas driver \u2019s license despite his \nadmitted residence (and continued residence) in Indiana and that he has  previously used (and been \ncriminally charged) under an alias .  (D.I. 78 at 8- 9). \nThe Defendant \u2019s conduct  also supports detention.  As the Government asserts, t he \nDefendant is not an unwitting pawn taken advantage of by others ; he is 31- year-old university \ngraduate.  (D.I. 78 at 9 (citing T r. 3:8- 12)).  He set up business entities and bank accounts to \ndisguise the nature of the criminal organization\u2019 s fraudulently- obtained proceeds and engaged in \na sophisticated international car shipping scheme to launder the proceeds. \nIn early March 2022, the FBI began reaching out  to Defendant on phone  numbers and email \naddresses connected to him through his bank accounts and business  entities.  The FBI left \nvoicemail and email messages  stating that an active arrest warrant had been issued and Defendant \nshould tum himself in to authorities.  On or about March 17, 2022, an FBI special agent  spoke on \nthe phone with someone who identified himself as Mr. Lawal and again advised that there was an \nactive warrant out for his arrest.   The D efendant at his detention hearing did not dispute receiving 8 those communications; he simply contended he thought the  communications \u201cwere not \nlegitimate. \u201d  (Tr. 15:8- 11).  The D efendant did not turn himself  in to author ities.  \nFor the following two months, the FBI continued to search for the D efendant through in \nperson surveillance at locations associated with the D efendant and through cell site location  \ninformation warrants on a phone number associated with the D efendant .  (D.I. 78 at 10).  Those \nefforts led  to an apartment building on Hector Place in Indianapolis, Indiana .  When law \nenforcement arrived at the address to arrest Defendant, it appears that he engaged in some minor \nefforts to avoid apprehension. \nThe Defendan t\u2019s history and characteristics therefore demonstrate that he has the incentive,  \nmeans, and capacity to flee from prosecution.  \nD. Section 3142(g)(4)  \u2013 the Nature and Seriousness of the Danger to  Any Person  \nor the Community           \nThe Government does not seek detention of Defendant based on potential danger to the \ncommunity.  When th at is the case, a court need not consider this factor.  See, e.g., United States \nv. Aziz , 2022 WL  1056102, at *3 n.1 (5th Cir Apr. 8, 2022); United Stat es v. Boustani , 356 F. \nSupp. 3d 246, 252 (E.D.N.Y. 2019).   \nE. The Government H as Established T hat It is More Likely T han Not That There  \nIs No Condition O r Combination of Conditions T hat Will Reasonably Assure  \nthe Defendant \u2019s Presence as Required        \nThe magistrate judge determined that the government met its burden at the contested \ndetention hearing to demonstrate that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably \nassure the D efendant \u2019s continued presence as required.  In his motion, the Defendant primarily \nrelies on the recommendation of the United States Probation Office in the Southern District of \nIndiana for release on conditions to support his argument.  The Probation Office , however,  made \nits recommendation  without the benefit of the G overnment \u2019s proffers  of evidence.  After hearing 9 \nthe proffer, the magistrate judge determined that the recommendation was not appropriate  and that \nno combination of conditions can account for Defendant \u2019s overseas ties  and access to a criminal \norganization with the means  \u2013 financial and criminal  \u2013 to support one of  its members \u2019 flight from \njustice.  \nDefendant also argues that his three co -defendants in this matter are each on pretrial  \nrelease.  As the Government aptly points out, however, none of  those defendants  made the choice \nthat the D efendant did -to purposefully ignore a federal arrest warrant for months.  (D.I. 78 at 11-\n12).  His co -defendants were either arrested  without incident at a known location or turned \nthemselves in upon getting noti fied by the FBI that  a warrant was out for their arrest.  (Id.).  \nMoreover, it appears that accounts  controlled by the D efendant received more money than those \nof his co- defendants and that the  Defendant converted more money to untraceable cash than his \nco-defendants.  And the Defendant,  unlike his co- defendants, has twice traveled to West Africa in \nthe past two years where he maintains close ties and where the criminal organization is apparently \nlocated.  ( Id.).  Thus, the D efendant presents a greater risk  of flight than his co- defendants.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nHaving considered the factors required and having reviewed Defendant\u2019s detention de \nnovo, a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that no combination of conditions will ensure \nthe appearance of the Defendant.  THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that  Defendant\u2019s \nMotion for de novo  Review of His Detention Order (D.I. 75) request ing an order releasing him \nconsistent with the conditions listed in the PS3 is DENIED .  Defendant shall remain detained.  \n \n               \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge  \n "}
