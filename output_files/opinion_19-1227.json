(\u201cEIS\u201d) against Defendants IntiHealth Ger GmbH,\nWOW Tech USA Ltd., WOW Tech Canada Ltd., and Novoluto GmbH (\u201cNovoluto\u201d), EIS seeks,\namongst other claims, declarations of non-infringement of United States Patent Nos. 9,763,851\n(\u201cthe \u2019851 patent\u201d), 11,090,220 (\u201cthe \u2019220 patent\u201d), 11,103,418 (\u201cthe \u2019418 patent\u201d), 9,849,061\n(\u201cthe 061 patent\u201d), and 9,937,097 (\u201cthe 097 patent\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cAsserted Patents\u201d), which\nare assigned to Defendant Novoluto. DJ. 111. In response, Novoluto asserts counterclaims of\ninfringement of the Asserted Patents against EIS, EIS GmbH, Triple A Import GmbH, and Triple\nA Marketing GmbH.! D.I. 118. Presently before the Court is the issue of claim construction of\nmultiple terms in the Asserted Patents. The Court has considered the parties\u2019 joint claim\nconstruction brief and accompanying appendices, see generally D.I. 208; 238; D.I. 239; D.I. 240;\nD.I. 241, and held a Markman hearing on November 21, 2022 (\u201cTr.__\u201d). D.I. 296.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nWhile the Court writes for the benefit of the parties and, thus, declines to explain the\nturbulent history between the parties\u2014including prior litigation in Germany and multiple\nproceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\u2014a brief overview of the relevant\ntechnology is helpful. The parties are both designers and proprietors of devices related to sexual\nhealth and wellness. See D.I. 238 at 1-6. The Asserted Patents all relate to a stimulation device\nfor erogenous zones, such as the clitoris. Jd. As the \u2019851 patent\u2014parent to the \u2019220 and \u00b0418\n\npatents\u2014summarizes, the stimulation device is directed to creating positive and negative\n\n1 For the purpose of clarity throughout this Memorandum Opinion, the Court refers to\nPlaintiff/Counterclaim Defendants as \u201cEIS,\u201d and Defendants/Counterclaimant as \u201cNovoluto.\u201d\n\n2\nmodulated pressures used to stimulate a user\u2019s preferred body part, including a clitoris. See \u2019851\npatent at 1:12-15, claim 1; see also \u00b0220 patent at claim 1; 418 patent at claim 1. Similarly, the\n\u00b0061 patent\u2014parent to the \u00b0097 patent\u2014is directed to creating positive and negative modulated\npressures to stimulate a user\u2019s body, but further includes an appendage that can be inserted into\nthe user\u2019s body. See \u00b0061 patent at Abstract; see also \u2019097 patent at Abstract. The parties dispute\nthe construction of nine terms across the Asserted Patents. D.I. 238.\nII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n\u201cTt is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to\nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\u201d Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312\n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v.\nSumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\u201cA claim in a patent provides\nthe metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from\nmaking, using, or selling the protected invention.\u201d). \u201c[{T]here is no magic formula or catechism\nfor conducting claim construction.\u201d Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the\nappropriate weight to appropriate sources \u201cin light of the statutes and policies that inform patent\nlaw.\u201d Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question of law, although\nsubsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct.\n831, 837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 372 (1996)).\n\n\u201cThe words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as\nunderstood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and\nprosecution history.\u201d Thorner v. Sony Comput. Entm't Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir.\n2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art \u201cis deemed to\n\nread the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term\nappears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\u201d Phillips, 415 F.3d at\n1313.\n\n\u201cWhen construing claim terms, [the court] first look[s] to, and primarily rely[s] on, the\nintrinsic evidence, including the claims themselves, the specification, and the prosecution history\nof the patent, which is usually dispositive.\u201d Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc.,\n731 F.3d 1271, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cOther\nclaims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted, can . . . be valuable\u201d in discerning\nthe meaning of a disputed claim term because \u201cclaim terms are normally used consistently\nthroughout the patent,\u201d and so, \u201cthe usage of a term in one claim can often illuminate the meaning\nof the same term in other claims.\u201d Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In addition, \u201c[d]ifferences among\nclaims can also be a useful guide[.]\u201d Jd For example, \u201cthe presence of a dependent claim that\nadds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present\nin the independent claim.\u201d Jd. at 1314-15.\n\nIn addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification, which \u201cis always highly\nrelevant to the claim construction analysis . . . [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a\ndisputed term.\u201d Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is\nalso possible that \u201cthe specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the\npatentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's\nlexicography governs.\u201d Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316 (citation omitted). \u201c{E]ven when the\nspecification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent will not be\nread restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope\nusing words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker\n\nCorp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Liebel-\nFlarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification \u201cis not\na substitute for, nor can it be used to rewrite, the chosen claim language.\u201d SuperGuide Corp. v.\nDirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d 870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n\nThe Court \u201cshould also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution history, if it is in evidence.\u201d\nMarlanan v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. 1995), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370,\n(1996). The prosecution history \u201ccan often inform the meaning of the claim language by\ndemonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the\ninvention in the course of prosecution[.]\u201d Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317.\n\nIn some cases, the Court \u201cwill need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to\nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the\nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\u201d Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841.\n\u201cExtrinsic evidence consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history,\nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d Markman, 52 F.3d\nat 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \u201cless significant than the intrinsic\nrecord in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.\u201d Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nIl. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS\n\nA. \u201cconnection element\u201d\n\nThe claim term \u201cconnection element\u201d appears in claim 1 of the \u2019851 patent and claims 1\nand 2 of the 061 patent. The parties\u2019 competing proposed constructions for \u201cconnection element\u201d\n\nare set out in the chart below:\n\nPlaintiff EIS\u2019s Construction | Defendant Novoluto\u2019s Construction.\n\n\u201cmedia flow path with a smaller | Plain and ordinary meaning, which\ncross-sectional area than the first | means \u201cstructure that connects two\nchamber\u201d structures\u201d\n\n\u201cconnection\nelement\u201d\n\nThe crux of the parties\u2019 dispute is two-fold: first, whether all of the claims of the Asserted\nPatents, even those claims that do not recite the term \u201cconnection element,\u201d should be construed\nto include that term, see D.I. 238 at 6, 12; and second, whether \u201cconnection element\u201d requires\n\n6,\n\nhaving a smaller cross-sectional area than the first chamber to provide the invention\u2019s \u201cperceptible\nmassage effect,\u201d id. at 8-10, 14-15. For the reasons set out below, the Court construes the claim\nterm \u201cconnection element\u201d to mean:\n\u201cstructure that connects two structures\u201d\nThe use of the disputed term in claim 1 of the \u2019851 patent is representative.\n1. A stimulation device for a clitoris, comprising:\na pressure field generator comprising:\n\na first chamber having a single opening;\n\na second chamber having first and second openings, the second opening of\nthe second chamber for placing over the clitoris; and\n\na connection element having a first opening and a separate second opening\nthereby forming a straight channel connecting the single opening of the first\nchamber with the first opening of the second chamber;\n\na drive unit that changes a volume of the first chamber in such a manner that a\nstimulating pressure field is generated in the second chamber via the\nconnection element, and\n\na control device that actuates the drive unit; and a housing enclosing the\npressure field generator, the drive unit, and the control device; wherein:\n\nthe pressure field generated in the second chamber consists of a pattern of\nnegative and positive pressures modulated with respect to a reference\npressure,\n\nthe first chamber is connected with the second chamber solely by the\nconnection element,\n\nthe stimulation device has no valves,\n\nthe stimulation device is a portable hand-held device with a battery,\nthe connection element is rigid and the first and second openings of the\nconnection element are aligned to one another so that a media flow during\na compression of the first chamber is directed to the clitoris through the\nstraight channel with a nozzle effect, and\n\nthe second opening of the connection element is configured to face the\nclitoris through the second chamber.\n\n\u00b0851 patent at claim 1 (emphases added).\n\nThroughout its briefing and during oral argument, EIS maintained the position that, while\nthe disputed term \u201cconnection element\u201d only appears in the \u2019851 and \u2019061 patents, all claims of\nthe Asserted Patents should be construed to include that term. See D.I. 238 at 6; Tr. at 9-10. EIS\nasserts that, because \u201cone of the core tenets and purported inventive aspects\u201d of the Asserted\nPatents is creating a \u201cperceptible massage effect\u201d and subsequent \u201cnozzle effect,\u201d even those\nclaims of the Asserted Patents that do not explicitly recite \u201cconnection element\u201d should be\nconstrued to include the same. Jd. at 6-8. While EIS is correct that, unless otherwise compelled,\na claim term should be construed consistently across related patents, see id. at 24, this proposition\ndoes not permit importing terms or limitations into the claims of related patents that do not recite\nthat disputed term. See Omega Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1333-35 (Fed. Cir.\n2003) (construing the disputed term consistently through multiple related patents because the\ncommon term was explicitly recited in the claims of each of the patents-in-suits). Rather, \u201cit is\nsettled law that when a patent claim does not contain a certain limitation and another claim does,\nthat limitation cannot be read into the former claim in determining either validity or infringement.\u201d\nSRI Int'l v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of Am., 775 F.2d 1107, 1122 (Fed. Cir. 1985). As such, the\nCourt rejects EIS\u2019s invitation to apply the construction of the disputed term \u201cconnection element\u201d\n\nin claims across related patents that simply do not recite the term. Therefore, the only claims\nrelevant to the Court\u2019s construction of the disputed term \u201cconnection element\u201d is claim 1 of the\n\u00b0851 patent and claims 1 and 2 of the \u2019061 patent.\n\nTurning to the parties\u2019 proposed constructions, EIS contends that its proposed construction\nis \u201cconsistent with the only connection element described\u201d in the specification and disclosed in\neach embodiment. D.J. 238 at 6; Tr. at 13 (\u201c[S]o if you look at the specification in the figures,\nevery embodiment has a connection element in which that connection element has a smaller cross-\nsectional area than the first chamber.\u201d). In other words, because \u201ceach and every embodiment of\nthe connection element is smaller in cross-sectional area to the first chamber,\u201d the term\n\u201cconnection element\u201d necessarily requires that its cross-sectional area be smaller than the first\nchamber. Jd. EIS asserts that this requirement is not arbitrary, but rather is required to create a\n\u201cstimulating pressure field\u201d which subsequently produces the \u201cperceptible massage effect.\u201d Jd. at\n7 (citing \u2019851 patent at 4:66-5:1 for the proposition that \u201cgenerated pressures are \u2018decisively\ninfluenced by the configuration . . . of the connection element.\u201d\u201d); see also Tr. at 29 (\u201cYou cannot,\nin a two-chamber device with a connection element, create this massage effect and accelerate the\nairflow back and forth in that connection element unless it\u2019s smaller. It\u2019s physics. And that\u2019s what\nthe specification tells us.\u201d). Like placing your thumb over a garden hose, which increases the\npressure causing the water to accelerate outward, EIS argues that only when the connection\nelement has a smaller cross-sectional area than the first chamber can the medium, i.e., air or water,\nbe sufficiently accelerated to create a perceptible massage effect. See D.I. 238 at 8-9; Tr. at 13\n(\u201c[JJust like putting your thumb over the hose, you can\u2019t accelerate that medium unless you reduce\nthe cross-sectional area.\u201d).\n\nIn response, Novoluto argues that the term \u201cconnection element\u201d has a plain and ordinary\n\nmeaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art as simply a \u201cstructure that connects two structures.\u201d\nD.I. 238 at 12. The plain and ordinary meaning is supported by the specifications of the 851 and\n\u00b0061 patents, which Novoluto contends consistently describe the \u201cconnection element\u201d as a\nstructure connecting other structures. See, e.g., \u00b0851 patent at 8:16-20 (\u201c[A] connection element\n5, which connects the first chamber 3 with the second chamber 4.\u201d); id. at 9:11-14 (\u201cTwo mutually\naligned openings in wall 41 of the second chamber and of holder 32 jointly form connection\nelement 5, which connects the first chamber 3 and the second chamber 5.\u201d); 061 patent at 8:58-\n59 (\u201c[A]nd a connection element 5 that connects the first chamber 3 to the second chamber 4.\u201d).\nFurther, Novoluto refutes EIS\u2019s contention that the generated pressures are decisively influenced\nby the connection element, see D.I. 238 at 7 (emphasis added), citing to portions of the 851 and\n\u00b0061 patents\u2019 specifications that recognize that the \u201cconnection element may be \u2018adjustable\u2019 and\nhave different configurations to provide different pressure fields.\u201d D.I. 238 at 13 (citing \u00b0851\npatent at 4:64-5:12); see also \u00b0061 patent at 4:22-29.\n\nThe Court agrees with Novoluto that there is no evidence compelling the Court to stray\nfrom the disputed term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316 (explaining\nthat absent evidence to the contrary, a term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning is the default). Simply\nput, to a person of ordinary skill in the art, the disputed term \u201cconnection element\u201d means a\nstructure that connects two structures. The plain and ordinary meaning is supported by the\nspecifications of both the 851 and 061 patents, which consistently describe the \u201cconnection\nelement\u201d as connecting the first chamber and the second chamber. See, e.g., \u2019851 patent at 3:58-\n63, 8:16-20, 9:11-14; 061 patent at 3:5-10, 8:55-59, 10:32-35. Moreover, the Court disagrees that\nthe \u201cperceptible massage effect\u201d is decisively influenced by the connection element having a\nsmaller cross-sectional area than the first chamber. See D.I. 238 at 7. In fact, both the \u2019851 and\n\n\u00b0061 patents\u2019 specifications explain that the perceptible massage effect may vary based on the\ndesign and interaction of several components of the stimulation device. See, e.g., \u2019851 patent,\n10:1-10 (\u201c[T]ype of flow can not only be advantageously influenced by the size and orientation of\nopening 51, but also by the inner configuration of the connection element\u201d); id. at 4:66-5:3\n(\u201c[P]ressure field is decisively influenced by the configuration of the . .. connection and...\nopening from the connection element into the second chamber, and is thus adjustable\u201d); id. at 9:62-\n64 (\u201c[I]ndirect (pressure) massage . . . ensues due to the medium flowing onto body part 11\u201d); id\nat 11:1-3 (\u201cplurality of channels 52 and openings 51, leads to a distribution of the pressure field\u201d);\n\u00b0061 patent at 14:58-61 (\u201c[P]roximity of opening 51 of connection element 5 to the area of skin . .\n. can also be used to determine the intensity of the massaging effect\u201d); id. at 14:62-65 (\u201cA plurality\nof openings 51 . . . allows the massaging effect to be distributed to a plurality of areas . . . [so] the\nclitoris can be stimulated less directly\u201d). Thus, the intrinsic record supports adopting the plain and\nordinary meaning of the term \u201cconnection element,\u201d which means a \u201cstructure that connects two\nstructures.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being unsupported by the intrinsic record, EIS\u2019s proposed construction\nconflicts with well-established canons of claim construction. First, in arguing that \u201cconnection\nelement\u201d requires having a smaller cross-sectional area than the first chamber, EIS improperly\nnarrows the meaning of the term to a single embodiment. See Supercell Oy v. GREE, Inc., 2021\nWL 4452082, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 29, 2021) (cautioning courts to avoid construing a term \u201con\nthe basis of a single exemplary embodiment\u201d). In doing so, EIS overlooks that the specifications\nof the \u2019851 patent and the \u2019061 patent disclose that the \u201cconnection element\u201d may be adjustable,\nand variations in the configuration of the connection element provides altering pressure fields. See\n\u00b0851 patent at 4:64-5:12; \u00b0061 patent at 4:23-28. For example, the \u201cconnection element\u201d may have\n\na single passageway with a nozzle effect between the first and second chamber, see, e.g., \u00b0851\n\n10\npatent at 5:6-9; \u00b0061 patent at 4:31-34, a plurality of passageways between chambers, see, \u00a2.g.,\n\u00b0851 patent at 5:9-12; \u2019061 patent at 4:34-38, or different inner configurations, such as helix-\nshaped grooves, see \u2019851 patent at 10:1-5. More so, the \u201cconnection element\u201d may be integrally\nformed or in one piece with the wall of the second chamber, see, e.g., \u00b0851 patent at 10:25-27;\n\u00b0061 patent at 11:51-54, and/or the first chamber, see, e.g., 851 patent at 5:44-48; \u2019061 patent at\n5:4-8, or formed with openings at different proximities to the area of skin to be stimulated, see,\ne.g., 851 patent at 12:18-21; 061 patent at 13:58-52.\n\nNext, EIS\u2019s proposed construction is belied by Figure 9 of the \u2019851 patent, which illustrates\na plurality of connection elements wherein the cross-sectional area is not smaller than the first\nchamber. See \u2019851 patent at 11:1-14, Figure 9; see also Verizon Servs. Corp. v. Vonage Holdings\nCorp., 503 F.3d 1295, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (rejecting a proposed claim interpretation that would\nexclude disclosed examples in the specification). Furthermore, in arguing that a smaller cross-\nsectional area of the \u201cconnection element\u201d is the cause of the \u201cstimulating pressure field,\u201d EIS\nignores that claim 1 of both the \u2019851 and \u2019061 patents separately recite that the drive unit, not the\nconnection element, generates the stimulating pressure field.? See, e.g., \u00b0851 patent at claim 1\n(\u201c[A] drive unit that changes a volume of the first chamber in such a manner that a stimulating\npressure field is generated in the second chamber via the connection element . . .\u201d); \u2019061 patent at\nclaim 1 (\u201c[A] drive unit that varies the volume of the at least one first chamber such that a\nstimulating pressure field is generated via the at least one connection element in the at least one\n\nsecond chamber ...\u201d). The separately recited \u201cdrive unit\u201d limitation must stand on its own and\n\n2? EIS\u2019s argument is premised on mistakenly interpreting \u201cvia\u201d to mean \u201cresponsible for.\u201d\nHowever, \u201cvia\u201d is used consistently throughout the \u2019851 and \u2019061 patents to mean \u201cthrough.\u201d See,\ne.g., \u00b0851 patent, at 5:19-21 (\u201cThus, the first chamber is preferably connected exclusively with the\nsecond chamber via or through the connection element.\u201d (emphasis added)); \u2019061 patent at 4:45-\n47 (same).\n\n11\ncannot be imported into the definition of \u201cconnection element.\u201d Promos Techs., Inc. v. Samsung\nElecs. Co., 809 F. App\u2019x 825, 834 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\u201c[I]t is generally improper to construe a patent\nclaim so that express claim limitations or elements are rendered superfluous.\u201d).\n\nFinally, there is no support for EIS\u2019s contention that the \u201c\u2018connection element\u2019 must . . .\nhave a cross-sectional area smaller than the first chamber in order to generate the claimed \u2018nozzle\neffect.\u2019\u201d See D.I. 238 at 10. Indeed, EIS concedes that the phrase \u201cnozzle effect\u201d does not even\nappear in the 061 patent. Jd. at 10 n.6. More so, EIS acknowledges that the 851 patent describes\n\u201cnozzle effect\u201d as an optional feature. Tr. at 30; see also \u2019851 patent at 4:64-5:12. Even if the\n\u00b0851 patent did not describe \u201cnozzle effect\u201d as an optional feature, EIS fails to proffer any intrinsic\nevidence that the \u201cnozzle effect\u201d is generated because the \u201cconnection element\u201d has a smaller\ncross-sectional area than the first chamber. EIS\u2019s selective citations to Novoluto\u2019s statements\nmade during the German prosecution of the \u2019851 patent\u2019s counterpart\u2014German Patent Application\nNo. DE102013110501 (\u201cthe \u2019501 German Patent\u201d)\u2014are similarly unavailing. See D.I. 238 at 10-\n11, 23. These statements, when viewed in their entirety, reveal that the German Patent Office was\ninterpreting the term \u201cnozzle effect\u201d as applied to \u201cstraight channel,\u201d not \u201cconnection element.\u201d\nId. at 17; D.I. 239, Ex. 17 at 8. In fact, in an opposition proceeding involving the \u00b0501 German\nPatent, the German Patent Office concluded that \u201c[t]he definition of two chambers which are\nconnected with a connection element does not by itself lead to the interpretation that a constriction\nor narrowing must be present in the overall cavity of the device.\u201d D.I. 239, Ex. 18 at 10.\n\nAccordingly, finding nothing in the intrinsic record to support EIS\u2019s proposed construction,\nnor evidence compelling a different interpretation, the Court construes \u201cconnection element\u201d to\n\nhave its plain and ordinary meaning\u2014\u201cstructure that connects two structures.\u201d\n\n12\nB. \u201cstimulation device\u201d\nThe claim term \u201cstimulation device\u201d appears in all independent claims of the Asserted\n\nPatents. The parties\u2019 competing proposed constructions for \u201cstimulation device\u201d are set out in the\n\nchart below:\n\nClaim Term Plaintiff EIS\u2019s Construction | Defendant Novoluto\u2019s Construction.\n\nPlain and ordinary meaning, which\n\u201ca device including at least a means \u201ca device that is capable of\nfirst chamber, a second chamber, sexually arousing or exciting\u201d\n\nand a connection element\nconnecting the first chamber\n\nwith the second chamber\u201d Alternatively: Plain and ordinary\n\nmeaning, which means \u201ca device\ndesigned to sexually arouse or excite\u201d\n\nWhile Novoluto has consistently argued that the Court should construe the term\n\u201cstimulation device\u201d to have its plain and ordinary meaning, Novoluto\u2019s proffered plain and\nordinary meaning has changed since the parties filed their Joint Claim Construction Chart. See\nD.I. 207. That is, Novoluto initially asserted that \u201cstimulation device\u201d has a plain and ordinary\nmeaning of \u201ca device that is capable of sexually arousing or exciting,\u201d see D.I. 238 at 28; see also\nD.I. 207 at 8-9, but now asserts that the plain and ordinary meaning is actually a \u201cdevice designed\nto sexually arose or excite,\u201d see D.I. 238 at 28-31. When asked why it modified its proposed\nconstruction and whether this modification incorporates more limiting language, Novoluto\nexplained that its new construction would reduce jury confusion because its initial construction\nfailed to account for the argument that amy object could be theoretically \u201ccapable of\u201d sexually\narousing. Tr. 48-49. Novoluto\u2019s newly proposed plain and ordinary meaning, while undisputedly\nbroader than originally proposed in the parties\u2019 Joint Claim Construction Chart, is not untimely.\n\nFar from being \u201cblindsided,\u201d EIS had the opportunity to address Novoluto\u2019s new construction both\n\n13\nin its Reply Brief and during the Markman hearing. D.I. 238 at 34. As such, the Court need not\ndiscount either of Novoluto\u2019s proposed constructions when construing \u201cstimulation device.\u201d\n\nThus, the remaining dispute turns on whether the term \u201cstimulation device\u201d was disavowed\nor defined by the Asserted Patents\u2019 specifications. D.I. 238 at 26-27, 29-31. For the reasons set\nout below, the Court finds that the Asserted Patents did not disavow or define the disputed term,\nand construes \u201cstimulation device\u201d to mean:\n\n\u201ca device that is capable of sexually arousing or exciting\u201d\n\nAbsent evidence of lexicography or disavowal, the Court will not depart from the plain\nmeaning of the claim terms. Thorner, 669 F.3d at 1365. The standard for finding either\nlexicography or disavowal are \u201cexacting.\u201d GE Lighting Sols., LLC v. AgiLight, Inc., 750 F.3d\n1304, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2014). A patentee may act as its own lexicographer and redefine claim terms\nin the specification but must \u201cclearly express an intent to redefine the term.\u201d Thorner, 669 F.3d at\n1365 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, disavowal requires that \u201cthe specification [or\nprosecution history] make[] clear that the invention does not include a particular feature.\u201d SciMed\nLife Sys. Inc. v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., 242 F.3d 1337, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001).\nAlthough such disavowal can occur either explicitly or implicitly, it must be clear and\nunmistakable. See Trs. of Columbia Univ. v. Symantec Corp., 811 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir.\n2016). Courts have routinely found disavowal based on clear and unmistakable statements by the\npatentee that limit the claims, such as \u201cthe present invention includes . . .,\u201d or \u201cthe present invention\nis...,\u201d or \u201call embodiments of the present invention are... .\u201d See, e.g., Regents of the Univ. of\nMinn. v. AGA Med. Corp., 717 F.3d 929, 936 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Honeywell Int'l, Inc. v. ITT Indus.,\nInc., 452 F.3d 1312, 1316-19 (Fed. Cir. 2006); SciMed Life Sys., Inc., 242 F.3d at 1343-44.\n\nUltimately, when a patentee \u201cdescribes the features of the \u2018present invention\u2019 as a whole,\u201d he\n\n14\nimplicitly alerts the reader that \u201cthis description limits the scope of the invention.\u201d Regents of the\nUniv. of Minn., 717 F.3d at 936.\n\nEIS contends that its proposed construction mirrors what Novoluto represented was \u201cthe\ninvention.\u201d D.I. 238 at 26-27. That is, Novoluto\u2019s use of the phrase \u201caccording to the invention\u201d\nin the \u2019851 patent and the 061 patent specifications prior to reciting components of a \u201cstimulation\ndevice\u201d were clear and unmistakable statements that limit the scope of that term. Jd Based on\nthis language, EIS summarily asserts that the patentee limited not just the term \u201cstimulation\ndevice,\u201d but all of the claims at issue across each of the Asserted Patents\u2014even the \u2019097, \u2019220,\nand \u00b0418 patents, which do not include the phrase \u201caccording to the invention.\u201d Jd at 27-28\n(\u201c[W]hile the above disclaimer is based on statements in the \u2019851 and \u2019061 patent specifications,\nit extends to the \u2019097, \u00b0220, and \u00b0418 patents because they incorporate by reference the\nspecification of the \u00b0851 or \u2019061 patents.\u201d).\n\nThe Court disagrees that Novoluto\u2019s use of the phrase \u201caccording to the invention\u201d rises to\nthe level of an express disavowal or lexicography. \u201cLanguage such as \u2018according to the invention\u2019\ndoes not necessarily limit the scope of the claims, at least where the language of the claims is more\ngeneral than the descriptions of the embodiments of the invention in the specification, and the\nreferences in the specification can fairly be read as directed to particular embodiments of the\ninvention rather than characterizing the full reach of the claims.\u201d Zadro Prod., Inc. v. SDI Techs.,\nInc., 2019 WL 10252726, at *6 (D. Del. June 19, 2019); Creative Integrated Sys., Inc. v. Nintendo\nof Am., Inc., 526 F. App\u2019x 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (statements that describe the invention as a\nwhole are more likely to support a limiting definition of a claim term, but \u201cthis principle has no\napplication where, as here, the other statements and illustrations make it clear that the limitations\n\ndo not describe the invention as a whole.\u201d). Here, although the common portions of the 851 and\n\n15\n\u00b0061 patents\u2019 specifications use the expression \u201caccording to the invention,\u201d the intrinsic evidence\nindicates that those statements are not characterizations of the full scope of the invention. See,\ne.g., \u00b0851 patent at 3:55-67, 4:33-36, 5:45-47, 10:25-27, 10:43-44; \u00b0061 patent at 3:1-10, 3:58-61,\n5:4-8. Instead, the intrinsic evidence makes it clear that those statements refer to embodiments\nthat are narrower than the scope dictated by the more general language of the claims. E.g., \u00b0851\npatent at 3:55-4:2; \u00b0061 patent at 3:1-16. The phrase \u201caccording to the invention\u201d in the \u00b0851 and\n061 patents does not define the outer limits of the invention, but instead merely describe\nembodiments and signals that those phrases cannot properly be interpreted as signaling restrictive\ncharacterizations of the invention as a whole. Therefore, the \u201caccording to the invention\u201d\nstatements in the \u2019851 and 061 patents\u2019 specifications do not support a limiting construction of\nthe term \u201cstimulation device.\u201d\n\nAs EIS has failed to proffer \u201cexacting\u201d evidence of lexicography or disavowal, the Court\ndeclines to depart from the plain meaning of \u201cstimulation device.\u201d Luminara Worldwide, LLC v.\nLiown Elecs. Co., 814 F.3d 1343, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Here, the claims relate to a \u201cstimulation\ndevice\u201d for \u201cerogenous zones\u201d such as the clitoris. See, e.g.,\u2019851 patent at claim 1 (\u201cA stimulation\ndevice fora clitoris . ..\u201d); 061 patent at claim 1 (\u201cA stimulation device for erogenous zones . . .\u201d).\nSimilarly, the specifications are plainly directed to stimulation devices for purposes of enhanced\nsexual pleasure. See, e.g., 851 patent at 6:40-47 (\u201c[U]se of the stimulation device according to\nthe invention as a sex toy for stimulating the female clitoris.\u201d); id. at 14:16-16:21 (\u201c[S]timulation\ndevice for a clitoris,\u201d \u201cchamber for placing over the clitoris\u201d); 061 patent at 7:37-39 (\u201cIn the\npresent invention, the methods for stimulating erogenous zones serve for sexual pleasure . . .\u201d); id.\nat 16:22-18:52 (\u201c[A]ppendage is a dildo configured to be inserted into a vagina,\u201d \u201cmethod for\n\nstimulating erogenous zones for sexual pleasure,\u201d \u201cinserting an appendage of a stimulation device\n\n16\ninto a vagina\u201d). Notably, the \u2019061 and \u2019097 patents explain that the claimed invention and related\nmethods \u201cdo not serve for medical, for example therapeutic, purposes,\u201d which further supports that\n\u201cstimulation device\u201d relates to enhanced sexual pleasure. See, e.g.,\u2019061 patent at 7:37-40; \u00b0097\npatent at 9:11-13.\n\nAlthough the Court construes \u201cstimulation device\u201d to have its plain and ordinary meaning,\nthe intrinsic record does not support limiting the term to a device \u201cdesigned to sexually arose or\nexcite.\u201d See D.I. 238 at 28. Such a construction would improperly limit the invention to a single\nembodiment, especially considering that each specification of the Asserted Patents explains that\n\u201c{t}he use of the present invention is thus not limited to the female clitoris 11, instead stimulation\ndevice 1 can be used on all body parts or erogenous zones (such as the inside of the upper thighs,\nthe loins, neck, nipples, etc.) ...\u201d See, e.g., 851 patent at 8:58-64; \u2019220 patent at 9:41-47 (same);\n\u00b0418 patent at 9:41-47 (same); \u2019061 patent at 10:9-15 (same); \u2019410 patent at 10:63-11:2 (same);\nSupercell Oy, 2021 WL 4452082, at *4. More importantly, that the claims recite a stimulation\ndevice \u201cfor\u201d erogenous zones or the clitoris is indicative of the invention\u2019s suitability, fitness,\nappropriateness, conduciveness, adaptation, and allowance\u2014all of which are consistent with the\nconstruction \u201ccapable of.\u201d Other courts have also recognized that use of the term \u201cfor\u201d generally\nsuggests capability of performing a function rather than an invention\u2019s intended or preferred use.\nSee, e.g., Gentex Corp. v. Revision Military Ltd.,2020 WL 1875529, at *3 (D. Del. Apr. 15, 2020);\nVizio, Inc. v. ITC, 605 F.3d 1330, 1339-42 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Ecolab, Inc. v. Envirochem, Inc., 264\nF.3d 1358, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Intel Corp. v. Broadcom Corp., 172 F. Supp. 2d 516, 546 (D.\n\nDel. 2001).\n\n17\nTherefore, as supported by the intrinsic record, the Court adopts the plain and ordinary\nmeaning of the term \u201cstimulation device,\u201d meaning \u201ca device that is capable of sexual excitement\nor arousal.\u201d\n\nC. \u201copening of the chamber\u201d\n\nThe parties initially indicated that the term \u201copening of the chamber\u201d required construction.\nSee generally D.I. 207. However, it became apparent during oral argument that the crux of the\nparties\u2019 dispute centered around construing the term \u201copening.\u201d Tr. at 56-58; 60-62. Thus, the\nCourt will only construe the disputed term \u201copening.\u201d? The term \u201copening\u201d appears in claims 1\nand 2 of the \u2019851 patent, claims 1-3 of the 061 patent, claims 1, 3, 12, 15, 17, 19, 26, and 29 of\nthe \u2019097 patent, claims 1, 3, 10, 17, and 19 of the \u2019220 patent, and claims 1, 3, 11, 19, and 21 of\nthe \u00b0418 patent. Both parties agree that \u201copening\u201d should be construed to have its plain and\nordinary meaning. D.I. 238 at 39-41, 43; Tr. 58 (EIS\u2019s counsel stating that the term \u201creally truly\nought to be a plain and ordinary meaning provided that the plain and ordinary meaning makes\nclear that it\u2019s the actual opening of that chamber.\u201d). Yet, as demonstrated by the chart below, the\n\nparties\u2019 proposed plain and ordinary meaning of \u201copening\u201d radically differs.\n\nPlu Novalete'e Cans\n\n\u201can aperture to the immediately Plain and ordinary meaning, which\ncontiguous structure\u201d means \u201ca hole that allows access\u201d\n\nThe use of the disputed term in claim 1 of both the \u2019851 patent and the \u00b0418 patent are\n\ninstructive.\n\n3 \u201cChamber\u201d is a separate term that the parties argue requires construction. See infra Section IILF.\nNotably, EIS\u2019s proposed construction for the term \u201copening of the chamber\u201d is inconsistent with\nits proposed construction of the term \u201cchamber,\u201d below. Compare D.I. 238 at 37 (construing\n\u201copening of the chamber\u201d to mean \u201can aperture to the immediately contiguous structure\u201d), with\nD.I. 238 at 67 (construing \u201cchamber\u201d to mean \u201cenclosed cavity\u201d).\n\n18\n1.

Brown v. 3M, 265 F.3d 1349, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\u201c[Terms that] are not\ntechnical terms of art . . . do not require elaborate interpretation.\u201d). \u201cOpening\u201d is not a technical\nterm of art that requires an elaborate interpretation. On their face, the claims consistently use the\nterm \u201copening\u201d to mean a \u201chole.\u201d See, e.g., 851 patent at claim 1 (\u201c[A] connection element having\na first [hole] and a separate second [hole] thereby forming a straight channel connecting the single\n[hole] of the first chamber with the first [hole] of the second chamber . . .\u201d); \u00b0418 patent at claim\n1 (\u201c[A] [hole] configured to sealingly engage a portion of a body of a user including a clitoris, the\nmodulated positive and negative pressures to be applied to the portion of the body via the [hole],\nthe [hole] being a sole [hole] of the chamber to an exterior of the stimulation device . . .\u201d).\nSimilarly, the Asserted Patents\u2019 specifications repeatedly refer to \u201copening\u201d as a \u201chole.\u201d See, e.g.,\n\u00b0851 patent at 3:60-61, Figures 12a\u201412d (illustrating that opening 51 is at least one hole); \u2019418\n\npatent at 4:17-19 (\u201cThe modulated positive and negative pressures are applied to a body part...\n\n20\nthrough an opening of the stimulation device.\u201d); \u2019061 patent at 6:40-41 (\u201c[T]he angle between the\nhandle and the opening of the second chamber can be adapted to suit the preferences of the user of\nthe device.\u201d). Other words are commonly used within the claims to modify the term \u201copening\u201d\u2014\ne.g., \u201cof the first chamber,\u201d \u201cof the second chamber,\u201d \u201cof the device,\u201d or \u201csole\u201d\u2014which indicates\nthat the term \u201copening,\u201d by itself, does not require a spatial limitation as EIS suggests. Cf D.I.\n238 at 38 (EIS\u2019s proposed construction requiring a spatial limitation of \u201cto the immediately\ncontiguous structure\u201d). Further, EIS\u2019s repeated reliance on its accused products to bolster its\nproposed construction, see D.I. 238 at 37-38 (mapping the disputed term in light of EIS\u2019s accused\nproducts), disregards that a claim is construed in light of the intrinsic record\u2014including the claims\nthemselves, the specification, and the prosecution history of the patent\u2014 \u201cnot in light of the\naccused device.\u201d SRT Int'l, 775 F.2d at 1118.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will construe the term \u201copening\u201d to have its plain and\nordinary meaning, which means \u201chole.\u201d\n\nD. \u201cflexible wall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion\u201d\n\nThe claim term \u201cflexible wall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion\u201d appears in all independent claims of\nthe \u00b0097 patent, the \u00b0220 patent, and the \u00b0418 patent. The parties\u2019 competing proposed\n\nconstructions for \u201cflexible wall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion\u201d are set out in the chart below:\n\n-| Defendant Novoluto\u2019s Construction |\n\n\u201cwall/wall portion that deflects Plain and ordinary meaning, which\nwall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall | without folding and unfolding | means \u201ca wall that is able to bend or\nportion\u201d like a bellows\u201d to be bent easily without breaking\u201d\n\nThe parties dispute whether the term \u201cflexible wall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion\u201d should be\nconstrued in light of Novoluto\u2019s purported disclaimer of the word \u201cbellows\u201d from the scope of this\n\ndisputed term during an infer partes review of the \u2019097 patent (\u201cthe \u2019097 patent IPR\u201d). See D.I.\n21\n238 at 47-49. For the reasons set out below, the Court finds that Novoluto did not expressly\ndisclaim the word \u201cbellows\u201d from the scope of term \u201cflexible wall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion.\u201d\nTherefore, the Court adopts the plain and ordinary meaning of the claim term \u201cflexible\nwall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion\u201d and construes the term to mean:\n\u201ca wall that is able to bend or to be bent easily without breaking\u201d\nThe use of the disputed term in claim 1 of the \u2019097 patent is representative.\n1.

D.I. 238 at\n50-51. Rather, when read in their full context, Novoluto\u2019s statements distinguishing the \u201cflexible\nwall\u201d claimed in the \u2019097 patent were directed specifically to the \u201cbellows\u201d of Taylor\u2014not\n\u201cbellows\u201d generally.

The intrinsic record demonstrates that Novoluto\u2019s statements distinguishing\n\u201cbellows\u201d from the \u2019097 patent\u2019s claimed \u201cflexible wall\u201d were directed only to the \u201cbellows\u201d\ndisclosed in Taylor, not \u201cbellows\u201d generally. To be sure, Novoluto argued that:\n\n[EIS] argues \u2018the accordion-like top wall of bellows 160\u2019 of Taylor corresponds to\nthe \u2018flexible wall portion.\u2019 Taylor\u2019s bellows does not, however, disclose the\n\n23\nrequired \u2018flexible wall portion\u2019 that deflects \u2018in opposing directions.\u2019 Taylor\u2019s\n\nbellows requires a material structurally stiff enough to fold and unfold as the\n\nbellows compresses and expands, otherwise, the bellows would not hold its shape\n\nand would not function as required. Taylor\u2019s bellows wall is structurally very\n\ndifferent from the flexible wall that deflects in opposing directions as claimed in\n\nthe \u2019097 Patent[.]\n\nD.I. 208, Ex. 2 at 52-53 (internal citations omitted).\n\nThat is, Novoluto explained that Taylor required a stiff structural material to fold and\nunfold while compressed and expanded, which it argued was plainly distinct from the \u2019097 patent\u2019s\nclaimed flexible wall deflecting in opposing directions. See id As illustrated below, because\nTaylor\u2019s bellows is made from a stiff structural material, force must be applied in opposing\n\ndirections across the bellows, i.e., compressing and expanding, thereby causing Taylor\u2019s bellows\n\nto fold and unfold. Jd. at 53.\n\nUNFOLDING OF BELLOWS DEFLECTION OF FLEXIBLE WALL\n\n=AAAS [Force\n\nRA NT UA\nBut this is different from the \u00b0097 patent\u2019s claimed \u201cflexible wall,\u201d whereby force is applied\nperpendicular to the \u201cflexible wall,\u201d causing deflections rather than folding and unfolding. Jd\n(\u201c[T]he folding and unfolding of the bellows wall does not \u2018cause deflections . . . in opposing\ndirections.\u2019 Rather, as the bellows compresses and expands, the folds move at varying angles and\ndirections with respect to each other.\u201d).\n\nFinding no evidence of a clear and unmistakable disavowal of the word \u201cbellows\u201d from the\n\nscope of the disputed term, the Court declines to apply the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer to\n\nthe term \u201cflexible wall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion.\u201d See Elbex Video, Ltd., 508 F.3d at 1371. Instead,\n\n24\nbecause a term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning is the default in claim construction, Phillips, 415 F.3d\nat 1316, the Court construes \u201cflexible wall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion\u201d according to its plain\nmeaning\u2014\u201ca wall that is able to bend or to be bent easily without breaking.\u201d Turning to the\nintrinsic record, the \u2019851 patent\u2019s (parent to the \u00b0220 and \u2019418 patents) and the \u2019097 patent\u2019s\nspecifications describe the \u201cflexible wall\u201d as made of a resilient material, such as silicone or\nrubber, which supports that the \u201cflexible wall\u201d must be able to bend. See, e.g.,\u00b0851 patent at 9:21-\n22, 10:45-46; \u2019097 patent at 11:31-32, 12:59-61. Various figures of the Asserted Patents similarly\nillustrate that the \u201cflexible wall\u201d bends without breaking to allow for the expansion and\ncompression of the chamber, thereby creating the desired \u201cstimulating pressure field.\u201d See, e.g.,\n\u00b0851 patent at Figures 4-6; \u00b0097 patent at Figures 4-6. Indeed, EIS does not dispute that the\n\u201cflexible wall\u201d must be able to bend easily, as it describes the \u201cflexible wall\u201d as an \u201celastic surface\u201d\nthroughout its briefing. See D.I. 238 at 47-48.\n\nAccordingly, the term \u201cflexible wall\u201d/\u201cflexible wall portion\u201d is construed to have its plain\nand ordinary meaning\u2014\u201ca wall that is able to bend or to be bent easily without breaking.\u201d\n\nE. \u201cpressure field generator\u201d\n\nThe claim term \u201cpressure field generator\u201d appears in claim 1 of the \u2019851 patent,\u2019 claims 17,\n21, 22, 26, 28, and 30 of the \u2019097 patent, claims 17 and 20 of the \u2019220 patent, and claim 19 of the\n\u00b0418 patent. The parties\u2019 dispute centers around whether \u201cpressure field generator\u201d is a means-\nplus-function term. The parties each propose separate constructions for \u201cpressure field generator\u201d\n\ndepending on whether Court finds that the term is a mean-plus-function term:\n\n4 Oddly, EIS omits claim 1 of the \u2019851 patent as a claim relevant to the construction of \u201cpressure\nfield generator,\u201d arguing that this claim \u201calready recites the construction EIS seeks.\u201d D.I. 238 at\n54 1.23.\n\n25\n_|- Plaintiff EIS\u2019s Constrt\n\nMeans-Plus- Function: \u201cgenerating a pressure\nFunction Term: field\u201d\n\n\u201cpressure field Structure: \u201cat least a first\ngenerator\u201d chamber, at least a second\nchamber, and at least one\n\nconnection element that connects\n\nthe first chamber with the second\nchamber and equivalents\u201d\n\n26\n\n_| Defendant Novoluto\u2019s Construction\n\nFunction: \u201cproviding modulated\npositive and negative pressure\u201d\n\nStructures: \u201c(1) a volume with a\nflexible wall portion; (2) a chamber\nwith a flexible wall portion; (3) a first\nchamber with a flexible wall portion,\na second chamber; (4) a first\nchamber, a second chamber with an\nopening, and a connection element\u201d\n\nFunction: \u201cgenerating a pressure field\nwith massaging effect\u201d\n\nStructure: \u201ca first chamber and a\n\nconnection element\u201d\n\nFunction: \u201ccreating media or air\nflow\u201d\n\nStructure: \u201c\u2018a first chamber, second\nchamber, connection element,\ncollectively formed as one piece,\nwhere first chamber is directly and\nexclusively connected to the second\nchamber without a valve to the\nenvironment surrounding the device\u201d\n\nFunction: \u201cgenerating a pressure\nfield\u201d\n\nStructures: \u201c(1) a chamber with a\nflexible wall portion; (2) a first\nchamber with a flexible wall portion,\na second chamber; a first chamber\nand a connection element; (3) a first\nchamber, a second chamber with an\nopening, and a connection element;\n(4) a first chamber; (5) a first\nchamber in the interior of the\n\nstimulation device, a second\nchamber, and a connection element\nthat connects the first chamber to the\nsecond chamber; (6) a chamber that is\nlargely or completely closed off from\nthe exterior of the pressure field\ngenerator when the pressure field\ngenerator is in contact with the body\npart to be stimulated, and which\nincludes two chambers and a\nconnection element; (7) a first\nchamber, a second chamber, a holder,\nand a connection element that\nconnects the first chamber to the\nsecond chamber; (8) a first chamber,\na replaceable second chamber, and a\nconnection element; (9) a first\nchamber, a second chamber, an\nintegrally formed connection element\n(.e., formed as one-piece) with the\nwall of the second chamber; (10) a\none-piece structure with a resilient\nchamber material; (11) a first\nchamber with a piston and no valves,\na second chamber, and a plurality of\nconnection elements constructed in\none piece\u201d\n\nNot a Means-Plus- \u201cat least a first chamber, a\nFunction Term: second chamber, and a Plain and ordinary meaning, which\nconnection element that connects | means \u201ca component that generates a\n\u201cpressure field the first chamber with the second pressure field\u201d\ngenerator\u201d chamber\u201d\n\nMeans-plus-function limitations permit a patentee to claim an element of the invention in\nterms of the element\u2019s function without reciting the corresponding structure in the claim itself.\nFraunhofer-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. v.

[\u00a7 112(f)}\u00b0, which\n\nprovides: An element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or\n\nstep for performing a specified function without the recital of structure in support\n\nthereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure\n\ndescribed in the specification and equivalents thereof.\nChicago Bd. Options Exch., Inc. v. Int\u2019l Sec. Exch., LLC, 677 F.3d 1361, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2012)\n(original alterations omitted). The Federal Circuit has further explained that \u201c\u00a7 [112(f)] represents\na quid pro quo by permitting inventors to use a generic means expression for a claim limitation\nprovided that the specification indicates what structure(s) constitute(s) the means.\u201d Jd. (quotation\nomitted).\n\nAs a threshold matter, when determining whether a limitation is a means-plus-function\nlimitation, \u201cthe use of the word \u2018means\u2019 in a claim element creates a rebuttable presumption that\n\u00a7 [112(H] applies. Applying the converse, . . . the failure to use the word \u2018means\u2019 also creates a\nrebuttable presumption\u2014this time that \u00a7 [112(f)] does not apply.\u201d Williamson v.

However, the presence or absence of the\nword \u201cmeans\u201d is not a per se indication of a means-plus-function limitation. Rather, \u201c[t]he\nultimate question is whether \u2018the claim language, read in light of the specification, recites\nsufficiently definite structure to avoid \u00a7 [112(H].\u2019\u201d MTD Prods.

Means-plus-function claims are statutorily limited to\nthe structure disclosed in the patent specification that corresponds to the claimed function. See\nMed. Instrumentation & Diagnostics Corp. v. Elekta AB, 344 F.3d 1205, 1219 (Fed.

Jd.\n\nClaim 17 of the \u00b0097 patent is instructive.\n\n17. A stimulation device, comprising:\n\na pressure field generator having a flexible wall portion;\n\na drive unit in physical communication with the flexible wall portion so as to\ncause deflections of the flexible wall portion in opposing directions, thereby\nresulting in a changing volume of the pressure field generator,\n\nthe changing volume of the pressure field generator resulting in modulated\npositive and negative pressures with respect to a reference pressure;\n\nan opening for applying the modulated positive and negative pressures to a\nbody part;\n\na control device for controlling the drive unit; and\n\nan appendage, wherein the appendage is a dildo configured to be inserted into\na vagina.\n\n29\n\u00b0097 patent at Claim 17 (emphases added).\n\nSince this claim\u2014nor any of the claims relevant to \u201cpressure field generator\u201d\u2014does not\nuse the word \u201cmeans,\u201d there is a rebuttable presumption that \u00a7 112(f) does not apply. Williamson,\n792 F.3d at 1348. Further, the Court finds that EIS has failed to rebut this presumption that\n\u201cpressure field generator\u201d is not a means-plus-function term because all of the relevant claims\narticulate a sufficient structure that includes various other structural features recited in each patent\nfor performing the claimed function, i.e., generating a pressure field.\n\n\u201cPressure field generator,\u201d as used consistently across the \u2019851, 097, \u2019220, and \u00b0418\npatents, conveys a sufficiently definite structure. See, e.g.,\u2019851 patent at 14:16-16:21; \u2019097 patent\nat 17:1-18:61; \u00b0220 patent at 14:60-16:57; \u00b0418 patent at 14:60-16:64. Beyond the structure\nconnoted by the specifications, each claim further delineates specific structures and explains the\nrelationship between the \u201cpressure field generator\u201d and other structures of the claimed device. For\nexample, the \u2019851 patent recites a \u201cpressure field generator comprising: a first chamber... a\nsecond chamber . . . a connection element,\u201d and \u201ca drive unit that changes a volume of the first\nchamber...\u201d See 851 patent at claim 1. Likewise, the 418 patent recites \u201ca pressure field\ngenerator including a first chamber and a second chamber, the first chamber including a flexible\nwall; a drive unit in physical communication with the flexible wall . . . resulting in a changing\nvolume of the first chamber . . .\u201d \u2019418 patent at claim 19. The \u2019097 patent claims that the \u201cpressure\nfield generator\u201d also has a volume that is changed by deflecting the flexible wall portion of the\n\u201cpressure field generator,\u201d and that the device has a drive unit in physical communication with the\nflexible wall portion. See \u2019097 patent at claim 1; see also id. at claim 17 (\u201c[A] pressure field\ngenerator having a flexible wall portion; a drive unit in physical communication with the flexible\n\nwall portion . . .\u201d). Moreover, claims 21 and 22 of the \u00b0097 patent further describe that the\n\n30\n\u201cpressure field generator\u201d has \u201ca first chamber and a second chamber\u201d and \u201cwherein the flexible\nwall portion is integral with the pressure field generator.\u201d See id. at claim 21,22. The \u2019220 patent\nsimilarly recites a definite structure of the pressure field generator, including \u201ca flexible wall\u201d\nwhich is \u201cintegral with the pressure field generator.\u201d See \u2019220 patent at claims 17, 20.\n\nFurther supporting the Court\u2019s conclusion is the opinion of Novoluto\u2019s expert, Dr.\nCameron, who opined that the term \u201cpressure generator\u201d and \u201cfield\u201d are generally known in the\nart and would convey a definite structure to a person of ordinary skill. See D.I. 239 at Ex. 41,\n65. Dr. Cameron explained that, in the context of the medical device industry, a person of ordinary\nskill would readily understand that use of the word \u201cfield\u201d indicates that the pressure is generated\nwithin a volume, i.e., a chamber. See id. at f] 65, 66. Thus, when considered in totality with the\nclaim language and specifications of the \u2019851, \u2019097, \u2019220, and \u2019418 patents, the Court is not\npersuaded that \u201cpressure field generator\u201d fails to connotate a definite structure to a person of\nordinary skill in the art such that \u00a7 112(f) applies. Rather, \u201cpressure field generator\u201d denotes a\ncomponent that generates a pressure field via the structural features recited in the claims. See id.\nat [J 65-67.\n\nAlternatively, EIS argues that, if the Court finds that \u201cpressure field generator\u201d is not a\nmeans-plus-function term, the Court should construe the term consistent with Novoluto\u2019s\npurported lexicography. DI. 238 at 56-57. In other words, \u201cpressure field generator\u201d should be\nconstrued to mean \u201cat least a first chamber, a second chamber, and a connection element that\nconnects the first chamber with the second chamber\u201d because Novoluto\u2019s alleged use of the phrase\n\u201caccording to the invention\u201d indicates an express limitation of the scope of that term. Jd. However,\nas explained above, language such as \u201caccording to the invention\u201d does not necessarily limit the\n\nscope of the claims where the references in the specification can fairly be read as directed to\n\n31\nparticular embodiments of the invention rather than characterizing the full reach of the claims.\nZadro Prod., Inc., 2019 WL 10252726, at *6. Here, there is no evidence, let alone rising to the\nlevel of \u201cclear and unmistakable,\u201d that Novoluto intended to redefine or limit the scope of\n\u201cpressure field generator.\u201d Rather, as clearly shown by the intrinsic evidence, Novoluto\u2019s\nstatements refer to embodiments that are narrower than the scope dictated by the more general\nlanguage of the claims. E.g., \u2019851 patent at 3:58-65 (\u201cAccording to the invention, a pressure field\ngenerator in the simulation device has at least one first chamber and at least one second chamber .\n. . This embodiment of chambers according to the invention communicating in a fluidic manner .\n. .\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the intrinsic record demonstrates that a person of ordinary skill in the art\nwould understand that \u201cpressure field generator\u201d connotates a sufficient and definite structure. See\nD.I. 239 at Ex. 41, {] 65-67. The term is used consistently across the 851, \u00b0097, \u00b0220, and \u2019418\npatents to denote a component that generates a pressure field. See, e.g.,\u2019851 patent at 14:16-16:21;\n\u00b0097 patent at 17:1-18:61; \u2019220 patent at 14:60-16:57; \u2019418 patent at 14:60-16:64. Thus, the Court\nconstrues \u201cpressure field generator\u201d to mean \u201ca component that generates a pressure field.\u201d Each\nof these patents separately recites limitations which define specific structures of various\nembodiments of that \u201ccomponent,\u201d e.g., a flexible wall, a volume, a first chamber, a second\nchamber, and/or a connection element, and recites the relationship between the pressure field\ngenerator and other structures of the device, i.e., drive unit.

A stimulation device for a clitoris, comprising:\na pressure field generator comprising:\na first chamber having a single opening;\n\na second chamber having first and second openings, the second opening of\nthe second chamber for placing over the clitoris; and\n\na connection element having a first opening and a separate second opening\nthereby forming a straight channel connecting the single opening of the first\nchamber with the first opening of the second chamber,\n\na drive unit that changes a volume of the first chamber in such a manner that\na stimulating pressure field is generated in the second chamber via the\nconnection element; and\n\na control device that actuates the drive unit; and a housing enclosing the\npressure field generator, the drive unit, and the control device; wherein:\n\nthe pressure field generated in the second chamber consists of a pattern of\nnegative and positive pressures modulated with respect to a reference\npressure,\n\nthe first chamber is connected with the second chamber solely by the\nconnection element,\n\nthe stimulation device has no valves,\n\n33\nthe stimulation device is a portable hand-held device with a battery,\n\nthe connection element is rigid and the first and second openings of the\nconnection element are aligned to one another so that a media flow during\na compression of the first chamber is directed to the clitoris through the\nstraight channel with a nozzle effect, and\n\nthe second opening of the connection element is configured to face the\nclitoris through the second chamber.\n\n\u00b0851 patent at claim 1 (emphases added).\n\nEIS urges the Court to adopt its proposed construction, \u201cenclosed cavity,\u201d arguing that it\nis directly supported by the intrinsic record and is \u201cimportant\u201d to help differentiate its accused\nproducts from Novoluto\u2019s anticipated infringement positions. D.I. 238 at 67-68; Tr. at 93 (\u201c[T]he\ndispute here arises really because Novoluto intends to argue that a single straight wall involving\nthe accused products comprises two chambers and connection element.\u201d). First, EIS argues that\n\u201cchamber\u201d must be \u201cenclosed\u201d because each claim that recites \u201cchamber\u201d specifies each opening\nof that chamber. D.I. 238 at 68. Thus, the claim language would not need to specify when, or if,\na \u201cchamber\u201d has an opening if the \u201cchamber\u201d was not naturally enclosed. Id. Next, EIS contends\nthat a \u201cchamber\u201d must be enclosed because a pressure field could not be physically transmitted\nthrough the chamber\u2019s opening via the connection element, as required by the claims, if there were\nother openings in the chamber. Jd Finally, EIS argues that because the Asserted Patents\u2019\nspecifications disclose the importance of \u201ctightly sealing\u201d the chambers of the device, \u201cchamber\u201d\nmust necessarily be enclosed. Id. at 68-69.\n\nReviewing both the claim language and the intrinsic record, the Court finds no support for\nEIS\u2019s proposed construction. In fact, and as EIS conceded during the Markman hearing, the\nAsserted Patents neither use the word \u201ccavity\u201d or the word \u201cenclosed\u201d in relation to \u201cchamber,\u201d\n\nsee Tr. at 99, 102, which belies EIS\u2019s contention that \u201cchamber\u201d necessarily has some defined\n\n34\nborders. See D.I. 238 at 73. More so, that the relevant claims specify each opening when reciting\nthe term \u201cchamber\u201d does not necessitate that \u201cchamber\u201d must be enclosed. Rather, specifying each\nopening simply limits that \u201cchamber\u201d to the number of openings recited in the claim\u2014e.g., the\n\u00b0851 patent recites that the first chamber has a single opening, meaning it is limited to one opening\nrather than two, three, etc. See \u2019851 patent at 14:18-19. Further, that the Asserted Patents\u2019\nspecifications disclose \u201ctightly sealing\u201d the chamber from the device\u2019s drive unit and other\ncomponents establishes that the chamber is not naturally enclosed. See, e.g., \u00b0851 patent at 5:13-\n16, 8:66-9:5, 10:27-29; 061 patent at 10:18-24, 14:57-52. Logically, an enclosed chamber would\nnot require sealing because, by definition, an enclosed chamber is already sealed from the outside.\nEIS\u2019s proposed construction also risks introducing undesired ambiguity as to the degree the cavity\nis \u201cenclosed,\u201d i.e., partially or fully, which was not squarely addressed by EIS when probed during\nthe Markman hearing. See Tr. 102-103 (\u201cThe Court: \u2018But does enclose mean fully enclosed,\npartially enclosed?\u2019 . . . [EIS\u2019s Counsel]: \u2018I think the dispute here, . . . is that they intend to just\ndraw boxes around arbitrary spaces and say that\u2019s a chamber. And without the chamber being\nsomething that\u2019s a little more articulated and defined, that\u2019s what it is going to be is just a box-\ndrawing exercise.\u2019\u201d). EIS\u2019s proposed construction masquerades as a genuine attempt to promote\nclarity, see D.I. 238 at 67, but is ultimately fueled by its non-infringement positions and\nunsupported by the intrinsic record. The Court rejects EIS\u2019s proposed construction as it is not\nsupported by the intrinsic record.\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. As\n\ndemonstrated by the Asserted Patents\u2019 specification, \u201cchamber\u201d is a nontechnical, plain-English\n\n35\nword that is consistently used to mean \u201ccompartment.\u201d\u00ae See, e.g., \u2019851 patent, 5:13-16, 8:16-20,\n8:39-40, 8:66-9:5, 10:27-29. Contrary to EIS\u2019s position, there is no intrinsic support for construing\n\u201cchamber\u201d to have \u201csome defined borders,\u201d see D.I. 238 at 73, because the claim language already\nrecites other claim limitations that define the chamber\u2019s structure. See, e.g., \u00b0851 patent at claim\n1 (\u201c{A] first chamber having a single opening; a second chamber having first and second openings\n...\u201d); 061 patent at claim 1 (\u201c[A]t least one second chamber having at least one opening for\nplacing on a body part . . .\u201d); id. at claim 4 (\u201c[W]herein the at least one second chamber is made\nin one piece with the at least one connection element and the at least one first chamber.\u201d); see also\nPromos Techs., 809 F. App\u2019x at 834 (\u201c[I]t is generally improper to construe a patent claim so that\nexpress claim limitations or elements are rendered superfluous.\u201d). Thus, the Court finds that\n\u201cchamber\u201d need not be construed to have some defined borders. Rather, \u201cchamber\u201d is construed\nto have its plain and ordinary meaning as informed by the intrinsic record, which means\n\u201ccompartment.\u201d\n\nG. \u201ccreate the modulated positive and negative pressures based on modulated\nfrequencies\u201d\n\nThe claim term \u201ccreate the modulated positive and negative pressures based on modulated\nfrequencies\u201d appears in claims 1 and 19 of the \u2019418 patent. During the Markman hearing, the\nparties agreed that the real dispute centered on construction of the term \u201cbased on modulated\nfrequencies.\u201d Tr. at 107-08. As such, the Court will only construe the term \u201cbased on modulated\n\nfrequencies.\u201d\n\n6 Although EIS highlights that at least one dictionary defines \u201cchamber\u201d as \u201ca natural or artificial\nenclosed space or cavity,\u201d see D.I. 239, Ex. 22 at 205, the Court need not function as a thesaurus\nwhen construing nontechnical, plain-English terms. Brown, 265 F.3d at 1352. More importantly,\nwhen a term\u2019s meaning is clearly informed by the patent\u2019s claim language and specification, as is\nhere, dictionary definitions cannot supplant that term\u2019s meaning. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1321.\n\n36\nThe crux of the parties\u2019 dispute is whether the term \u201cbased on modulated frequencies\u201d is\nindefinite or, whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand, with reasonable\ncertainty, what \u201cfrequencies\u201d are required to be modulated. EIS asserts that the term \u201cbased on\nmodulated frequencies\u201d is indefinite and, thus, declines to proffer a construction. See D.I. 238 at\n74. Novoluto disagrees, arguing that, when read in light of the intrinsic evidence, the term \u201cbased\non modulated frequencies\u201d \u201cclearly informs, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art\nabout the scope of the invention.\u201d Jd. at 76. Novoluto proposes to construe the term \u201cbased on\nmodulated frequencies\u201d as \u201cbased on changes in the drive unit speed,\u201d which it argues is supported\nby a person skilled in the art\u2019s understanding of the term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. Id. at 77-\n78.\n\nSection 112 of the Patent Act requires that the claims of a patent \u201cparticularly point[] out\nand distinctly claim[] the subject matter which the inventor . . . regards as the invention.\u201d 35\nU.S.C. \u00a7 112(b). The \u201cprimary purpose of the definiteness requirement\u201d contained in \u00a7 112(b) \u201cis\nto ensure that the claims are written in such a way that they give notice to the public of the extent\nof the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, e.g.,\ncompetitors of the patent owner, can determine whether or not they infringe.\u201d All Dental Prodx,\nLLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779-80 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n\n\u201cA patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification\ndelineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those\nskilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\u201d Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572\nUSS. 898, 901 (2014). To determine indefiniteness, courts examine \u201cthe patent record\u2014the claims,\nspecification, and prosecution history\u2014to ascertain if they convey to one of skill in the art with\n\nreasonable certainty the scope of the invention claimed.\u201d Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.,\n\n37\n789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015). While a \u201c\u2018potential infringer\u2019\u201d need not \u201cbe able to\ndetermine ex ante if a particular act infringes the claims,\u201d the patentee must \u201capprise the public \u2018of\nwhat is still open to them[]\u2019\u201d such that \u201ca person of ordinary skill in the art could determine whether\nor not an accused product or method infringes the claim.\u201d Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude Med.\nS.C., Inc., 30 F.4th 1339, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (citations omitted) (internal quotations\nomitted). B The challenger must \u201cprov[e] indefiniteness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d BASF\nCorp. v. Johnson Matthey Inc., 875 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2017).\n\nLike claim construction, definiteness is a question of law, but the Court must sometimes\nrender factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the ultimate issue of definiteness.\nSee, e.g., Sonix Tech. Co. v. Publications Int'l, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \u201c[A]ny\nfact critical to a holding on indefiniteness must be proven by the challenger by clear and convincing\nevidence.\u201d One-E-Way, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm'n, 859 F.3d 1059, 1062 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (cleaned\nup).\n\nThe disputed term \u201cbased on modulated frequencies\u201d is not indefinite. While EIS is correct\nthat the \u2019418 patent\u2019s specification never mentions the phrase \u201cmodulated frequencies,\u201d see D.I.\n238 at 75, this alone does not prove with \u201creasonable certainty\u201d that a person of ordinary skill in\nthe art reading the intrinsic record would not be able to determine the meaning of the disputed\nterm. In fact, the claim language is clear that the modulated positive and negative pressures are\nbased on modulated frequencies of the drive unit:\n\na drive unit in physical communication with the flexible wall to cause at least a\n\nportion of the flexible wall to deflect in opposing directions, thereby resulting in a\n\nchanging volume of the chamber, the changing volume of the chamber resulting in\nmodulated positive and negative pressures with respect to an ambient pressure,\n\n38\nacontrol device configured to receive input from the user and control the drive unit\n\nto cause the at least the portion of the flexible wall to deflect to create the\n\nmodulated positive and negative pressures based on modulated frequencies, .. .\n\u00b0418 patent at claim 1 (emphases added).\n\nIndeed, the \u00b0418 patent\u2019s figures confirm that the modulated positive and negative\npressures with respect to the ambient pressure are created by the drive unit deflecting at least a\nportion of the flexible wall in opposing directions to change the volume of the chamber. See \u2019418\npatent at Figures 4-6. The specification further explains that the modulated positive and negative\npressures with respect to ambient pressure may be based on controlling the drive unit\u2014such as\n\u201can electric motor,\u201d see \u2019418 patent at 9:6-16\u2014to modulate, or change, \u201cthe size of the deflection,\nthe frequency, the modulation, etc.\u201d See id. at 13:15-17. The term \u201cfrequency,\u201d as related to a\n\u201cdrive unit\u201d or \u201can electric motor,\u201d has clear and concise meaning to a person of ordinary skill in\nthe art as \u201cspeed.\u201d D.I. 238 at 79-80; D.I. 240 at Ex. 67, Ff 37-38. Thus, a person of ordinary skill\nin the art, reading the entire \u2019418 patent, would understand that changing the frequency, i.e., speed,\nof the drive unit would affect the rate of deflection of the flexible wall and, thereby, change\nmodulation of the positive and negative pressures.\n\nThat the disputed term is not indefinite is further confirmed by Novoluto\u2019s expert, Dr.\nCameron, who testified during the Markman hearing that \u201cfrequency,\u201d in the context of mechanical\nengineering, is clearly understood to be the speed of the motor in the drive unit.\u201d Tr. at 116 (\u201c[T]he\nreason we say frequency is that the motor speed is measured like in revolutions per minute or per\n\nsecond .. . but in loose terms we call that the speed.\u201d). The \u201cfrequency\u201d of an electric motor, i.e.,\n\n7 Notably, EIS\u2019s indefiniteness argument is premised on the \u2019418 patent not reciting what the\nmodulated frequencies are based on. D.I. 238 at 74-75. But merely a few sentences later, EIS\nacknowledges that \u201cfrequency\u201d is used in the \u2019418 patent to refer only to controlling the drive unit.\nId. at 75. Rather than heed to its own concession, however, EIS continued to pursue a Sisyphean-\nlike indefiniteness argument.\n\n39\nthe \u00b0418 patent\u2019s \u201cdrive unit,\u201d can be adjusted by the control device, see \u2019418 patent at 13:15-17,\nthereby changing the size of deflections of the flexible wall. Tr. at 115. Changing the size of\ndeflections of the flexible wall \u201cchanges the rate of change in volume, which is basically what\ncreates the modulated pressures.\u201d Jd. Thus, adjusting the drive unit speed via the contro] device\nnaturally affects the modulation of positive and negative pressures.\n\nTherefore, when read in light of the entirety of the \u00b0418 patent, a person of ordinary skill\nin the art would be clearly informed, with reasonable certainty, that the term \u201cbased on modulated\nfrequencies\u201d refers to changes in the drive unit speed. EIS has not carried its burden of\ndemonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that the term is indefinite. Accordingly, the\nCourt, based on the intrinsic record, construes \u201cbased on modulated frequencies\u201d to mean \u201cbased\non changes in drive unit speed.\u201d\n\nH. \u201csealingly engage a portion of a body of a user including a clitoris\u201d\n\nThe term \u201csealingly engage a portion of a body of a user including a clitoris\u201d appears in\nclaims 1 and 19 of the \u2019418 patent and claims 1 and 17 of the \u2019220 patent. Like the term \u201cbased\non modulated frequencies\u201d above, here the parties dispute whether the term \u201csealingly engage a\nportion of a body of a user including a clitoris\u201d is indefinite.\n\nEIS argues that it is indefinite because the term \u201csealingly\u201d incorporates a degree of\napproximation\u2014to what degree of a seal is required to be considered \u201csealingly\u201d engaged\u2014which\na person of ordinary skill in the art would not be able to understand with reasonable certainty. D.I.\n238 at 80-21. EIS seeks to bolster its indefiniteness argument by contending that Novoluto has\ninconsistently represented the required degree of a seal. Jd That is, Novoluto allegedly\nrepresented during the prosecution of the \u2019220 patent that a perfect seal is required to obtain\n\npositive and negative pressures, but later argued that the device produces \u201cmodulated positive and\n\n40\nnegative pressures without a \u2018100 percent airtight seal,\u2019\u201d ie., \u201cjust a tight enough seal,\u201d during an\ninter partes review of the \u00b0851 patent (\u201cthe \u2019851 IPR\u201d). See D.I. 238 at 81. Novoluto purportedly\nadvanced the same inconsistent position made in the 851 IPR during litigation of the 501 German\nPatent when it represented that \u201ca tight seal was not necessary for infringement,\u201d and that\n\u201calternating positive and negative pressures are possible even in the presence of an air gap.\u201d D.I.\n238 at 81. Thus, because a person of ordinary skill in the art could not, let alone Novoluto itself,\n\u201cdetermine with reasonable certainty how much of a seal is actually required by the claims,\u201d \u201cthese\nclaims should be found indefinite.\u201d D.I. 238 at 82 (citing D.I. 239 at Ex. 27, {J 57-63).\n\nApplying the same framework as detailed above, see supra Section III.G, the Court finds\nthat EIS has not met is burden of demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201csealingly\nengage a portion of a body of a user including a clitoris\u201d is indefinite. See BASF Corp., 875 F.3d\nat 1365. The specifications of the \u00b0418 and \u2019220 patents explain that \u201csealing engagement of the\nopening of the device with the user\u2019s body\u201d is \u201clargely or completely sealed off\u2019 such that the\nedges of a chamber \u201cideally form an air-tight bond with the surface of body part 11.\u201d See, e.g.,\n\u00b0418 patent at 9:49-55; \u00b0220 patent at 9:49-55; see also \u2019851 patent at 8:66-9:5. In other words,\nthe chamber is \u201csealed tightly to the body part . . . for the most part\u201d by placing the opening of the\ndevice on the body part to be stimulated. See, e.g., \u00b0418 patent at 13:31-36; \u00b0220 patent at 13:31-\n36. Accordingly, a person of ordinary skill in the art would readily determine, with reasonable\ncertainty, that a \u201csealing engagement\u201d between the opening of the stimulation device and the body\nof the user, including a clitoris, is not a 100 percent perfect seal. See, e.g., D.I. 239, Ex. 26 at\n94:21-100:15; id. at Ex. 41, [] 72-74; id. at Ex. 42, 9 73-77.\n\nContrary to EIS\u2019s contention, Novoluto consistently represented that \u201csealingly engage a\n\nportion of a body of a user including a clitoris\u201d does not require a perfect seal during the\n\n41\nprosecution of the \u2019220 patent. See D.I. 238 at 81, 86-87. There, in distinguishing a prior art\nreference\u2014United States Patent No. 1,042,058 (\u201cVan Hook\u201d}\u2014Novoluto highlighted that Van\nHook does not teach or suggest any seal with the body because Van Hook\u2019s claimed telephone\nreceiver cap is \u201cheld close to the ear.\u201d D.I. 208, Ex. 4 at 14. Novoluto explained that \u201cholding\nsomething close to one\u2019s body does not mean a seal is formed,\u201d and even if Van Hook\u2019s telephone\nreceiver cap was placed against the ear, it \u201cwould merely be in contact\u201d with the ear rather than\n\u201csealingly engaged.\u201d Jd. These statements, when viewed in their full context, demonstrate that\nNovoluto did not equate \u201csealingly engage\u201d with forming \u201ca perfect seal.\u201d This is consistent with\nNovoluto\u2019s statements made during the \u2019851 patent IPR, where it argued that to create the\nmodulated positive and negative pressures with respect to ambient pressure, a seal between the\nopening in the device and the body of the user need not be 100 percent airtight. See D.I. 239, Ex.\n26 at 94:21-100:15.\n\nNor did Novoluto make \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d statements equating \u201csealingly engage\u201d\nwith \u201cfluid-tight\u201d or \u201cperfect seal\u201d that rise to the level of a prosecution history disclaimer. See\nElbex Video, 508 F.3d at 1371; D.I. 238 at 87. During the prosecution of the 220 patent, Novoluto\nseparately argued that Van Hook\u2019s diaphragm was not fluid-tight because it does not \u201csealingly\nseparate the drive unit from the portion of the body,\u201d as required by claim 1, \u201cdue to the screw 35\nextending through the hole.\u201d D.I. 208, Ex. 4 at 15-16 (emphasis added). But, Novoluto\u2019s\nprosecution statements relate to an entirely different term, \u201csealingly separate,\u201d and are not\nindicative of a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d disclaimer of the disputed term \u201csealingly engage.\u201d\n\nTherefore, a person of ordinary skill viewing the intrinsic record would clearly understand\nthat \u201csealingly engage\u201d does not require a perfect seal. This makes sense in light of the claims\n\nreciting that the opening is configured to \u201csealingly engage a portion of a body of a user.\u201d See,\n\n42\ne.g., 418 patent at claim 1; \u2019220 patent at claim 1. In other words, \u201cbecause you are pressing [the\ndevice] against a body party . . . [i]t\u2019s unrealistic to think that somebody . . . can apply that much\npressure to make, for example, a 100 percent seal of a body without any discomfort.\u201d Tr. at 135\n(testimony of Novoluto\u2019s expert, Dr. Cameron). During the Markman hearing, Novoluto\u2019s expert,\nDr. Herbenick, confirmed this understanding by explaining that the clitoris, which is claimed as\nengaging with the device, see, e.g., 418 patent at claim 1 (\u201c[A] portion of a body of a user\nincluding a clitoris\u201d); 220 patent at claim 1 (same), \u201cvar[ies] in size from person to person,\u201d and\nis located in \u201can uneven a fleshy part of the body.\u201d Tr. 150-51. A person of ordinary skill in the\nart would, therefore, understand that forming \u201ca completely perfect 100 percent seal would be\nhighly unlikely with [this] part of the body.\u201d Jd at 151. Moreover, a person of ordinary skill\nunderstands that stimulating a user\u2019s clitoris to organism, see, e.g., \u00b0418 patent at 8:13-19; \u2019220\npatent at 8:13-19, will vary in time based on the user. See Tr. 152-153. As \u201cthe average time to\norganism can be 11-13 minutes,\u201d \u201cit would be very unlikely\u201d that a user could hold \u201ca device like\nthis to the body and maintain[] a 100 percent perfect seal for long periods of time without moving\nit.\u201d Tr. at 153. Ultimately, Dr. Herbenick concluded that \u201csealingly engage\u201d does not require a\nperfect seal, but rather \u201ca good enough seal for those modulated positive and negative pressures to\nbe working and directed toward the body part including the clitoris.\u201d Tr. 154-155.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that the disputed term \u201csealingly engage a portion of a body\nof a user including a clitoris\u201d is not indefinite. Nor would a person of ordinary skill in the art\nunderstand that the disputed term requires \u201ca perfect seal.\u201d Rather, as informed by the intrinsic\nrecord, see, e.g., \u00b0418 patent at 13:31-36; \u00b0220 patent at 13:31-36, \u201csealingly engage a portion of\n\na body of a user including a clitoris\u201d is construed to mean \u201ca sufficient enough seal, which does\n\n43\nnot have to be a perfect 100 percent seal, on a portion of a body of a user including a clitoris to\nallow the creation of positive and negative pressures relative to the ambient pressure.\u201d\n\nI. \u201creference pressure\u201d\n\nThe claim term \u201creference pressure\u201d appears in claims 1, 2, and 4-6 of the \u2019851 patent,\nclaims 1-3, 5, 7, 8, 11-19, and 21-26 of the \u2019061 patent, claims 1-30 of the \u2019097 patent, claims 1,\n3-12, 14, 16, 17, and 19-25 of the \u00b0220 patent, and claims 1, 3-13, 15, 17-19, 21-27, 34, and 35 of\nthe \u2019418 patent. The parties\u2019 dispute centers around whether the term needs to be construed at all\nand, if so, whether \u201creference pressure\u201d should be construed consistently with the Patent Trial and\nAppeals Board\u2019s (\u201cPTAB\u201d) construction during infer partes review proceedings involving the\n\u00b0097, \u2019851, and \u2019061 patents (the \u201cRelevant IPRs\u201d).\n\nNovoluto argues that \u201creference pressure\u201d should be construed consistently with the\nPTAB\u2019s construction during the Relevant IPRs, i.e., \u201ca prevailing pressure acting on the device\nprior to placing the stimulation device on the area of skin to be stimulated.\u201d See, e.g., D.I. 238 at\n89; D.I. 208 at Ex. 6 at 12, Ex. 7 at 13, Ex. 8 at 21. EIS allegedly proposed \u201cnumerous\nconstructions\u201d of \u201creference pressure\u201d during the Relevant IPRs, but Novoluto contends that all\nwere rejected by the Board. D.I. 89-91. EIS argues that this representation \u201cis simply false,\u201d and\nmaintains that the Court \u201cneed not construe a term simply because Novoluto requests as much.\u201d\nD.I. 238 at 89 (citing Nidec Motor Corp. v. Zhongshan Broad Ocean Motor Co. Matal, 868 F.3d\n1013, 1017 (Fed. Cir. 2017)). Believing that construction \u201cis not necessary here,\u201d EIS does not\nproffer its own construction. Jd. at 89. Nor does EIS dispute PTAB\u2019s construction of \u201creference\n\npressure.\u201d\u00ae Id. at 90.\n\n8 BIS also did not challenge PTAB\u2019s construction of \u201creference pressure\u201d on appeal in a\nconsolidated appeal of all Relevant IPRs. See D.I. 240, Ex. 69.\n\n44\nEIS\u2019s actions during the Relevant IPRs indicate that there is an actual dispute regarding the\nproper scope of the term \u201creference pressure.\u201d See id. at Exs. 6-8. That is, because EIS previously\nproposed constructions for \u201creference pressure\u201d in each of the Relevant IPRs, and even later\nproposed modified constructions, it is clear that there is a dispute regarding the proper scope of\nthis term which requires the Court\u2019s to construe the term. See O2 Micro, 521 F.3d at 1360.\n\nReviewing the claim language and the specifications of the Asserted Patents, the Court\nconstrues the term \u201creference pressure\u201d to mean \u201ca prevailing pressure acting on the device prior\nto placing the stimulation device on the area of skin to be stimulated.\u201d This construction is\nsupported by each of the Asserted Patents\u2019 specifications, which explain that:\n\nThe reference pressure is usually the [[atmospheric pressure acting on the\n\nstimulation device that prevails when application begins]/[existing ambient\n\npressure in relation to the stimulation device at the beginning of use]] (i.e. prior to\nplacing the stimulation device on the area of skin to be stimulated). In the preferred\n\n[application/use] of the stimulation device with air, the reference pressure is the\n\ncurrently [prevailing/existing] air pressure or normal pressure.\n\nSee, e.g., 097 patent at 5:17-22; \u2019061 patent at 3:38-43; \u00b0851 patent at 4:20-25; \u00b0220 patent at\n5:65-6:3; \u00b0418 patent at 5:65-6:3.\n\nThe Court\u2019s construction is also consistent with Novoluto\u2019s representation of the term\nduring the prosecution of the \u2019097 patent. D.I. 238 at 89. There, in attempting to overcome\nmultiple prior art rejections, Novoluto argued that \u201creference pressure\u201d is not an arbitrarily selected\n\u201cmedium\u201d or middle point, but rather has meaning tied to the prevailing pressure acting on the\nstimulation device prior to placing the device on the area of skin to be stimulated. See D.I. 239,\nEx. 38 at 258, 244 (\u201c[T]he user will experience a low suction, a medium suction and a high suction\n\npressure, wherein the low suction pressure is considered as a positive pressure relative to the\n\nmedium suction pressure (reference pressure), while the high pressure would be the negative\n\n45\npressure relative to the medium suction pressure); and a control device for controlling the drive\nunit.\u201d); see also id., Ex. 39 at 16-19.\n\nWhile the PTAB\u2019s construction of a disputed term is not binding on this Court, \u201cwhere the\nconstruction is similar to that of a district court\u2019s review,\u201d it is appropriate to take the PTAB\u2019s\nclaim construction into consideration. Genuine Enabling Tech., LLC v. Sony Corp., No. 17-135,\n2020 WL 1140910, at *7 (D. Del. Mar. 9, 2020) (quoting SunPower Corp. v. PanelClaw, Inc., No.\n12-1633, 2016 WL 1293479, at *6 (D. Del. April 1, 2016). Here, the Court finds the PTAB\u2019s\nreasoning persuasive. In rejecting each of EJS\u2019s proposed constructions during the Relevant IPRs,\nPTAB explained that its construction of \u201creference pressure\u201d is:\n\n[N]ot limited to atmospheric pressure (as originally proposed in [EIS\u2019s Petition]),\n\nbut refers generally to the prevailing pressure in the device before it is applied to\n\nthe body as described in the Specification of the [\u2019097, \u2019851, and \u2019061 patents]. This\n\nrefers to the pressure within the device regardless of the environment in which it is\n\nused. For instance, the Specification of the [\u2019097, \u2019851, and \u00b0061 patents] list[]\n\nadditional environments to include \u2018a liquid medium, such as water or\n\ncommercially available lubricant.\u2019 . . . It is clear that, when read in context, the\nreference pressure referred to in this paragraph is the prevailing pressure in the\n\ndevice before the device is applied to the body part.\n\nSee, e.g., D.I. 208, Ex. 6 at 11-12, Ex. 7 at 11-13, Ex. 8 at 20-21 (modified).\n\nThe Court agrees with PTAB\u2019s reasoning that \u201creference pressure\u201d is not limited to\natmospheric pressure because each of the Asserted Patents\u2019 specifications contemplate using the\ndevice regardless of the environment, i.e., air, liquid medium, lubricant. See, e.g., 097 patent at\n5:5-27; \u2019851 patent at 4:9-25; 061 patent at 3:26-49. Instead, \u201creference pressure\u201d relates more\nbroadly to the existing ambient pressure, regardless of the medium, prior to placing the device on\n\nthe user\u2019s desired body part. See, e.g., 097 patent at 11:49-57, 15:34-37; \u00b0851 patent at 12:51-53;\n\n\u00b0061 patent at 14:49-54.\n\n46\nAccordingly, the Court is persuaded by PTAB\u2019s construction of the term \u201creference\npressure,\u201d and construes the term to mean \u201ca prevailing pressure acting on the device prior to\nplacing the stimulation device on the area of skin to be stimulated.\u201d\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe Court will construe the disputed claim terms as described above. The Court will issue\n\nan Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n47\n"}
