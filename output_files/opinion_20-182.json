Hall,  B\nLANK ROME LLP, Wilmington, DE; Mark S. Indelicato, \nJeffrey Zawadski , HAHN HESSEN LLP, New York, NY \u2013 Attorneys for Appellee.  \n                    November  23, 2021  \nWilmington, Delaware   \nNOREIKA, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nPending before the Court are Appellants\u2019 Motion to Alter, Amend, and Reconsider this \nCourt\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order Affirming the Delaware Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Reissued \nMemorandum Order Denying Appellants\u2019 Motion to Reopen (D.I. 22)  (\u201cMotion\u201d) .1  For the \nreasons set forth herein,  the Court will deny the Motion.  Appellants seek the correction of \npurported errors of law  to prevent \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n59(e) and, presumably, the \u201ccatchall\u201d provision of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).  \n(D.I.  22 at 2).  Because in the Motion  Appellant s attempt to re -litigate arguments that were already \nconsidered and rejected by this Court, the Motion fails to sa tisfy the requirements of either Rule \n59(e) or 60(b) and will be denied.  \nI. BACKGROUND \n \n Appellants move  to alter, amend , and reconsider its February 16, 2021 Memorandum \nOpinion (D.I. 18) and Order ( D.I. 19), pursuant to  Rule s 59(e) and 60(b) of the  Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure , which are applicable to this proceeding through Rules 9023 and 9024 of the \nFederal R ules of Bankr uptcy  Procedure , respectively.   \nII. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD  \n  A Rule 59(e) motion must be based on \u201cone of three grounds: (1) an intervening change in \ncontrolling law; (2) the availability of new evidence; or (3)  the need to correct a clear error of law \nor fact or to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d   Lazaridis v. Wehmer , 591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir. 2010) \n(citing N. River Ins. Co. v. CIGNA Reinsurance Co., 52 F.3d 1194, 1218 (3d Cir. 1995)). \n \n1  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to those terms in the Motion.  2 Courts considering motions for reconsideration have held that a \u201c\u2018clear error  of law or fact\u2019 \nrequires a finding that the error is \u2018plain and indisputable . . . amount[ing] to a complet e disregard \nof the controlling law or the credible evidence  in the record.\u2019\u201d  In re Energy Future Holdings \nCorp., 575 B.R. 616, 629 (Bankr. D. Del. 2017) ( quoting In re Titus , 479 B.R. 362, 368 (Bankr. \nW.D. Pa. 2012) ) (remaining citations omitted).  Simila rly, courts have observed that \u201cmanifest  \ninjustice\u201d  \nis an error in the trial court that is direct, obvious, and observable  . . . .  A \nparty may only be granted reconsideration based on manifest injustice  if the \nerror is apparent to the point of being indisputable  . . . .  [T]he record  \npresented must be so patently unfair and tainted that the error is  manifestly \nclear to all who view it.  \n \nId. (quoting Titus , 479 B.R. at 367- 68). \nUnder Rule 60(b), relief from an order may be sought under certain enumerated \ncircumstances, including, relevant to the Motion, \u201cany other  reason justifying relief from the \noperation of the judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nIt is well settled that reconsideration is reserved for \u201cextraordinary  circumstances.\u201d  See, \ne.g., In re Energy Future Holdings Corp., 904 F.3d 298, 316 (3d Cir. 2018).  It \u201cshould be granted \nsparingly and may not be used to rehash arguments which have already been briefed by the parties \nand considered and decided by the Court.\u201d  Jester v. St ate Dep\u2019t of Safety , 2016 WL 4497055, *1  \n(D. Del. Aug. 26, 2016) (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Reconsideration \u201cis not \nintended to present a litigant with a second bite at the apple.\u201d  Id . (internal quotations and citation \nomitted).  The movant \u201cbears  a heavy burden\u201d in showing that reconsideration is appropriate.  See, \ne.g., Bohus v. Beloff, 950 F.2d 919, 930 (3d Cir. 1991). \n  3 III. DISCUSSION  \nThe Motion argues that the Trustee (1) lacked authority to take any action with respect to \ntheir loan pursuant to paragraph 69 of the MCO2 ( D.I. 22 at 3-6), and (2) was precluded from \nraising collateral estoppel or res judicata as a defense to Appellants\u2019  motion to reopen the New \nCentury bankruptcy cases ( id. at 7 -10).  These arguments  were already considered and rejected by \nthis Court .  Accordingly, the Motion fails to satisfy the requirements of either Rule 59(e) or 60(b).  \nA. Appellants\u2019 MCO Interpretation Argument Has Been Considered and \nRejected  \n \n Appellants argue  that this Court erred as a matter of law because \u201cit declined to  interpret \n\u00b6 69 out of deference to the DBKC\u201d and failed to first \u201cdetermine if [\u00b6  69] is ambiguous\u201d before \ndeferring to the DBKC\u2019s interpretation of \u00b6  69 of the MCO.  (D.I. 22 at  2).  In support  of these \nalleged errors, however , Appellants  rehash their prior arguments that it is (a) \u201cclear and \nunambiguous that[,] as a matter of law, pursuant to \u00b6  69 of the MCO, the only party entitled to \nrequest and receive relief is a party which purchased a mortgage loan directly from one of the \nDebtors or an agent acting on behalf of such party\u201d ( id. at 4), and, therefore, (b) the Trustee lacked \nauthority to \u201cexecute[] the LPOA and authorize[] the execution of the Walker Affidavit and \nAllonge upon the reque st of the FL Defendants.\u201d ( Id. at 6). \nThese arguments were briefed ( see D.I. 12 at  33- 35 & D.I. 14 at  5-7), considered, and \nrejected by this Court.  (See Memorandum Opinion at 17-19).  As such, reconsideration is \ninappropriate.  See, e.g., Lazaridis , 591 F.3d at  669 (where \u201cmotion advanced the same  arguments \nthat were in complaint and [previous] motions . . .  [there was no] proper  basis for \nreconsideration.\u201d); Karr v. Castle , 768 F. Supp. 1087, 1093 (D. Del. 1991) ( reconsideration is not \nan opportunity to \u201caccomplish repetition of arguments that were or should have been presented to the court previously\u201d).  Even  assuming these arguments  warranted reconsideration , Appellants  4 misstate or misapprehend the facts and this Court\u2019s findings.  Contrary to Appellants\u2019 assertions , \nthis Court ruled that the actions taken by the Trustee were \u201crequired\u201d to be taken pursuant to \u201cthe \nclear language of the Modified Confirmation Order.\u201d  (Mem orandum Opinion at 17).  Appellants  \ndisagree with the Court\u2019s  ruling and continue to argue for an interpretation contrary to a plain \nreading of \u00b6  69 of the MCO.  (D.I. 22 at  4).  Appellants\u2019  disagreement with the Court\u2019s ruling, \nhowever,  constitutes neithe r \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d nor the \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d necessary \nfor reconsideration.  See Am. Media Inc. v. Anderson Mgmt. Servs. (In re  Anderson News, LLC) , \n2018 WL 2337132, *4  (D. Del. May 23, 2018) (\u201cA party\u2019s mere disagreement with the Court does  \nnot translate into the type of clear error of law which justifies reconsideration of a ruling\u201d); Carr  \nv. Jacobs (In re New Century TRS Holdings, Inc.) , 2013 W L 1680472, *2 (D. Del. Apr. 17, 2013) \n(\u201cdisagree[ment] with court\u2019s ruling . . . is an insufficient basis for relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\u201d).  \nB. Appellants\u2019 Preclusion Argument Has Been Considered and Rejected  \n \nAppellants further  argue that this Court erred as a matter o f law because the \u201cFLBKC\u2019s \ndenial of the Expedited Motion . . . [resulted] in Mr. Jacobs et al. [being]  [c]ollaterally [e]stopped \nfrom raising the [d]octrines of [c]ollateral [e]stoppel and  [r]es [j]udicata as a defense\u201d to the motion \nto reopen New Century\u2019s bankruptcy cases ( D.I. 22 at  8), and \u201cthis Court lacks jurisdiction to enter \nan order contradicting the FLBKC Judgment.\u201d  (Id. at 7).  In support of this argument , however, \nAppellants  have rehashed  their prior, flawed arguments  and baseless  inference that  the FLBKC \norder somehow precluded the Trustee  from arguing that Appellants\u2019 claims were barred by res \njudicata and collateral  estoppel.  (Id. at 7-10).  These arguments have already been extensivel y \nbriefed ( see D.I. 12 at  36-38 & D.I. 14 at 7- 10), considered, and rejected by this  Court.  (See \nMemorandum Opinion at 20-22).  This Court has determined that the arguments and  the supporting \ndocuments that Appellants sought to have the Court take judicial notice of were offered for the 5 first time on appeal, and, therefore, could not be considered.  Even if they were not being raised \nfor the first time on appeal, the Court determined that the documents were not relevant to the  new \narguments raised b y Appellants because the FLBKC did not make any findings with respect to \ncollateral estoppel or res judicata; rather, it merely declined to exercise its discretion to  issue an \ninjunction under the All Writs Act in denying the Expedited Motion. ( See Memoran dum Opinion \nat 22).  As such, reconsideration is inappropriate.  See, e.g., Lazaridis , 591 F.3d at  669; Karr , 768 \nF. Supp. at 1093. \nFinally, e ven if the Court were to consider the substance of Appellants\u2019  arguments , the \narguments fail as they misconstrue the law.   It is black letter law that the only court that had \njurisdiction to determine whether reopening the New Century bankruptcy cases was warranted \n(including whether no valid purpose would be served by reopening those cases due to res judicata \nor collateral estoppel) was the DBKC.  See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7157(b)(1) -(2)(A).  \nMoreover, as the Trustee correctly points out, Appellants\u2019  argument that \u201cthe Delaware Courts \nlack jurisdiction to interpret and/or  reverse a valid judgment of the Florida Bankruptcy Court\u201d \n(D.I. 22 at 7) is  at odds with the relief Appellant s seek from thi s Court \u2014to \u201csend the case back  to \nthe DBKC for further consideration of the issues related to Mr. Jacobs defenses  and the FLBKC \nFinal Judgment.\u201d   (Id. at 10).  Thus, although Appellants clearly  disagree with this Court\u2019s ruling, \nsuch disagreement does not constitute \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d or the  \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d \nnecessary for reconsideration. See Anderson News, 2018 WL 2337132, *4; New Century , 2013 \nWL 1680472, *2  \n  6 IV. CONCLUSION \nThe Motion is an attempt to  re-litigate arguments that were already considered and rejected \nby this Court .  As such, the Motion fails to satisfy the requirements of either Rule 59(e) or 60(b) .  \nAn appropriate order  follows.  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nMICHAEL D.
