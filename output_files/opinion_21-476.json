A party may feel wronged when its counterpart \nbreaches . But a breach, without more, is not fraud.  Here,  a stakeholder was fired , \nthen denied  money he was owed . While the company may have breached a contract , \nit is not guilty of fraud . So I dismiss the  fraud  claims . And because the stakeholder\u2019s \ncontract left no room  for implied term s, I dismiss his claim for  breach of an implied \ncovenant too.    \nI. BACKGROUND  \nRichard Schuetze was a partner and member of Utilligent, LLC, a consulting com-\npany. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 6\u20137. (Formally, his relationship with Utilligent was through \nRichard A. Schu etze, Inc. But for ease of re ference, I will refer to the man behind the \ncorporation .) Schuetze had two  agreement s with Utilligent . One  gave him a stake in \nthe company ; the other described when Utilligent could fire him and buy back  his \ninterest . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6\u20137, 12, 14; D.I. 31 -1 (Operating Agreement) ; D.I. 1 -1 (Buyback Agree-\nment).  \nBut the relationship soured . Utilligent fired  Schuetze for cause  and bought back  \nhis stake . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201319. Schuetze  counters that  Utilligent fabricat ed that  cause and \nnever paid him for his  stake . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, 24 .  \nDispleased, Schuetze sued Utilligent for breach ing their contracts  and implied \ncovenants of good faith and fair dealing . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 25\u201344. He also charges fraud, saying \nUtilligent \u2019s false assurances  duped him into signing the Buyback Agreement in  the \nfirst place . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 48\u201353. For his trouble, Schuetze seeks damages, a declaratory judg-\nment, and litigation expenses . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 45\u201347, 54\u201357. 3 Now  Utilligent moves  to dismiss . D.I. 30. It asks me to  dismiss all claims except \nthose for breach of contract and declaratory relief. Utilligent is mostly right, so I dis-\nmiss Schuetze\u2019s claims for fraud and breach of an implied covenant and  his request \nfor punitive damages. But I will not dismiss Schuetze\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and \nexpenses  just yet . \nII. I DISMISS SOME OF SCHUETZE \u2019S CLAIMS  \nOn this motion to dismiss , I \u201caccept  as true all allegations  in the complaint\u201d and \ndraw  \u201call reasonable inferences\u201d in Schuetze\u2019s favor. Davis v. Wells Fargo , 824 F.3d \n333, 341 (3d Cir. 2016) ( internal quotation marks omitted) . In doing so, I can consult \nthe parties\u2019 agreements  because  Schuetze\u2019s complaint is \u201cbased\u201d on these \u201cundisput-\nedly authentic documents.\u201d Wolfington  v. Reconstructive Orthopaedic Assocs. II PC , \n935 F.3d 187,  195 (3d Cir. 2019) ; D.I. 1-1 (Buyback Agreement); D.I. 31- 1 (Operating \nAgreement).  \nA. I dismiss Schuetze\u2019s fraud claim  \nSchuetze alleges that Utilligent\u2019s false assurances duped him into signing the \nBuyback Agreement. Compl., D.I. 1  \u00b6 15. But that claim fails twice over. He does not  \nplead his cause precisely  enough. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b ). Plus, he never says he relied on \nthose assurances.  \nBut first,  a threshold  issue: the parties dispute whether Delaware or Georgia law \ngoverns Schuetze\u2019s fraud claim. But I need not resolve that question because \nSchuetze\u2019s claim fails under either state\u2019s law.  Williams v. Stone, 109 F.3d 890, 893 \n(3d Cir. 1997).  In both states, fraud plai ntiffs must plead  that they relied on the 4 falsehoods over which they sue . Compare Fowler v. Overby , 478 S.E.2d 919, 921 (Ga. \nCt. App. 1996)  with In re Wayport, Inc. Litig. , 76 A.3d 296, 323 (Del. Ch. 2013) . \nOn to the merits. To recover for  fraud, Schuetze  must describe the fraud  \u201cwith \nparticularity.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). He \u201cmust allege the date, time and place of the \nalleged fraud or otherwise inject precision or some measure of substantiation.\u201d \nShuker v. Smith & Nephew, PLC , 885 F.3d 760, 778 (3d Cir. 2018) ( internal quotation \nmarks omitted).   \nSchuetze does neither. He says Utilligent lied twice:  once, when it promised not to \nfire him  except  on \u201cspecific grounds \u201d; and again when it promised not to \u201c act arbitrar-\nily or unreasonably to terminate\u201d h im. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  15. Yet he does not say w hen, \nwhere, or how  Utilligent said those things . See Alpizar -Fallas v. Favero , 908 F.3d 910, \n919 (3d Cir. 2018) . \nSchuetze also fails to adequately plead that those statements were false. That \nsinks  his claim in  Georgia and Delaware . See Fowler , 478 S.E.2d at 921; In re Way-\nport, 76 A.3d at 323.  Indeed, he never says that Utilligent fired him in a way that \nconflicted  with its earlier promises. Schuetze\u2019s  bald allegation that Utilligent lied is  \nnot enough.  Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  28; see Davis v. Wells Fargo , 824 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. \n2016)  (noting that courts should  \u201cdisregard \u2026 mere  conclusory \u201d allegations).  \nLikewise, Schuetze does not plausibly allege that he justifiably relied on Utilli-\ngent\u2019s assurances.  Fowler , 223 Ga. App. at 803; In re Wayport , 76 A.3d at 323. Why \nwas it reasonable for Schuetze to rely on alleged promises that contradicted the 5 Buyback Agreement\u2019s express terms? The complaint never says . So his fraud claim \nfalls flat.   \nB. I also dismiss Schuetze\u2019s claim for breach of an implied covenant  \nNext, Schuetze claims that Utilligent breached implied covenants of good faith \nand fair dealing  in the Buyback Agreement . Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  40\u201343. Utilligent objects  that \nthe agreement\u2019s  express terms leave no room for an  implied covenant. D.I. 31, at 12. \nBecause I agree, I dismiss this claim  too. \n1. Withholding  pay. First, S chuetze claims that Utilligent breached an implied \ncovenant by \u201crefusing to pay [ him] for [his] membership interest.\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  40. \nBut to breach an implied covenant, that covenant  must exist in the first place. And \nimplied covenants cannot  exist  when, as here, express contracts govern the dispute . \nSee Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, L.L.C. , 971 A.2d 872, 888 (Del. Ch. 2009). The Buyback \nAgreement says what Schuetze is owed for his  membership interest. D.I. 1 -1 \u00a7 2(e) \n(the purchase price is either \u201cfifty percent \u2026 of the [f]air [m]arket [v]alue\u201d (without \ncause) or \u201cequal to the consideration  paid by [Schuetze]\u201d (for cause)) . And the Oper-\nating Agreement defines payment terms. D.I. 31 -1, Art. II, \u00a7  2.1 (\u201cIf \u2026 the parties are \nunable to resolve their disagreement  [about price] , an independent appraiser \u2026  will \nbe retained .\u201d). So I will not imply a ny more  obligations.  \n2. Refusing to calculate the membership interest and distributions.  Schuetze ar-\ngues that Utilligent breached implied covenants to \u201cnegotiate with [him] in good faith \nfor a fair and accurate valuation\u201d of his  membership interest and the  distributions he \nis owed. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  42\u201343. These claims fail for the same reason. T here is no \nspace for his implied  terms : The Buyback Agreement specifies how much Utilligent 6 owed Schuetze once it fired him . D.I. 1 -1 \u00a7 2(e). And i t also stipulates that he is enti-\ntled to \u201cany portion of any distributions\u201d when fired . D.I. 1 -1, ex. A, \u00a7  3.  \n3. Lying about cause . Last, Schuetze alleges that Utilligent breached an implied \nterm by \u201cmanufactur ing false grounds\u201d to \u201cfalsely claim []\u201d that he  was fired for cause. \nCompl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  40\u201341. Not so.  The Buyback Agreement lists four express grounds \nto fire him for cause. D.I. 1 -1 \u00a7 1(b). Three of those leave no room for his implied term. \nIf he was fired under one of those clauses, Schuetze must allege that Utilligent \nbreached that  express term by fabricat ing cause.  \nTrue, one of the grounds gives  Utilligent full discretion  to decide  whether Schuetze \nadequately performed his \u201cobligations to the [ c]ompany.\u201d D .I. 37, at 17\u2013 19 (quoting \nD.I. 1 -1 \u00a7 1(b)(i)). And  it must exercise that discretion in  good faith . Airborne Health, \nInc. v. Squid Soap, LP , 984 A.2d 126, 146\u2013 47 (Del. Ch. 2009).  But Schuetze does not \nallege that he was fired  under that discretionary provision. So I dismis s this claim as \nwell.  \nC. I dismiss Schuetze\u2019s claim for punitive damages too \nSchuetze argues that he  deserves  punitive damages  for his breach of contract \nclaim. Not so. (Because I dismissed his fraud and breach- of-implied contract claims, \nI need not decide w hether he could recover punitive damages for those counts ).  \nIn Delaware, \u201cpunitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract unless \nthe conduct  also amounts independently to a tort.\u201d E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. \nPressman , 679 A.2d 436, 445 (Del. 1996); see also Bhole, Inc. v. Shore Invs., Inc. , 67 \nA.3d 444, 454 (Del. 2013). None of Schuetze\u2019s allegations fit s the bill.  7 Schuetze says that Utilligent breached the Buyback Agreement in two ways. First, \nhe says  Utilligent failed to pay money it owes under the contract. Compl., D.I. 1 \n\u00b6\u00b6 28\u201329, 31. Second,  it did not  \u201cnegotiate \u2026 for a fair and accurate valuation of [ his] \nmembership interest. \u201d Id. \u00b6 30. But none of that  alleged conduct \u201c would amount in-\ndependently to a tort ,\u201d so punitive damages are not available . Owens v. Connections \nCmty. Support Programs, Inc. , 840 F. Supp. 2d 791, 799\u2013 800 (D. Del. 2012).  \nD. Schuetze\u2019s demand for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses survives \nFinally, Schuetze asks for attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expens es under Delaware \nor Georgia law. Since his Georgia  claims  do not  survive, I dismiss his  request for fees \nunder Georgia law.  But I deny Utilligent\u2019s motion to dismiss Schuetze\u2019s Delaware -\nlaw claim. D.I. 37, at 15. ( \u201c[T]he parties agree that Delaware law applies to \n[Schuetze\u2019s] contractual claims. \u201d). \nDelaware generally makes  each party bear its own litigation expenses. Kaung v. \nCole Nat. Corp. , 884 A.2d 500, 506 (Del. 2005). But not always. Id. A court may award \nthe winning party fees where it s opponent \u201chas \u2018acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wan-\ntonly, or for oppressive reasons. \u2019\u201d Brice v. State, Dep \u2019t of Corr ., 704 A.2d 1176, 1179 \n(Del. 1998) (quoting Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019 y, 421 U.S. 240, 258\u2013\n59 (1975)). At this stage, i t is too soon  to tell. So I will not dismiss this claim.  \n* * * * * \nSchuetze fails to plausibly plead fraud or a breach of an implied covenant. Plus, \nno law supports his claim for punitive damages. So I dismiss each of these claims \nwithout prejudice. But Sc huetze\u2019s request for fees survives.  "}
