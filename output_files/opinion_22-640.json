(collectively, \u201cHorizon\u201d) against \nDefendant Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, \u201cApotex\u201d), Horizon alleges infringement \nof claim 12 of United States Patent No . 9,066,913 (the \u201c'913 patent\u201d).  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 1)  Presently \npending before the Court is Apotex\u2019s motion for summary judgment (the \u201cMotion\u201d).  (D.I. 31)  Horizon opposes the Motion.  For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is GRANTED.\n1 \nI.  BACKGROUND A.  Factual Background \n The key relevant background facts are not disputed.    In January 2013, Apotex entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201c2013 Settlement \nAgreement\u201d) with Nuvo Research Inc. (\u201cNuvo\u201d) , Mallinckrodt Inc. and Mallinckrodt LLC \n(together with Mallinckrodt Inc., \u201cMallinckrodt\u201d) to resolve litigation between the parties over a 1.5% strength of diclofenac sodium topical solution product ( referred to herein as \u201c PENNSAID\u00ae \n1.5%\u201d ).  (D.I. 33, ex.  2)  At the time, Nuvo was the owner of U nited States Patent Nos. \n8,217,078 (the \u201c'078 patent\u201d) and 8,252,838 (the \u201c'838 patent\u201d).  ( Id. at 1)   Mallinckrodt was an \nexclusive licensee of the '078 and '838 patents and the holder of the New Drug Application for PENNSAID\u00ae 1.5% .  (Id.)  The 2013 Settlement Agreement granted Apotex a license to certain \npatents relating to PENNSAID\u00ae 1.5% and  also granted Apotex rights relating to potential future \nmanufacture and commercialization  of a generic version of a 2% strength topical diclofenac \n \n 1  The parties have jointly consented to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to conduct all \nproceedings in this case, including trial, the entry of final judgment and all post- trial \nproceedings.  (D.I. 24) \n3 sodium product  (referred to herein as \u201cPENNSAID\u00ae 2% \u201d).  The relevant license provision, \nSection 6.1, provides that:  \nMallinckrodt and Nuvo hereby grant, to the extent that they \nlawfully may, to Apotex, on and after the 2.0% Launch Date and \nterminating on the 2.0% Termination Date, a non- exclusive, \nroyalty- free and fully paid- up, non- sublicensable, non- transferable \n(except as expressly permitted by Section 11.3 of this Agreem ent) \nright and license under their respective rights in and to the '078 \nLicensed Patent and to the '838 Licensed Patent, and to any other patent that they now own or that they may acquire in the future, sufficient to allow Apotex to make, have made, use, s ell, offer to \nsell, import, and distribute the Apotex 2.0% Product in and for the Territory, or to make or have made the Apotex 2% Product in the nation of Canada for the sole purpose of thereafter importing the Apotex 2.0% Product from the nation of Canada into the Territory and to sell, offer to sell, and distribute the Apotex 2.0% Product in and for the Territory.  \n (Id. at \u00a7 6.1)  The \u201c '838 Licensed P atent \u201d is defined in the 2013 Settlement Agreement as the  \n\u201c['838 patent ] and any patents that issue from any divisions, continuations, reissues or \nreexaminations thereof.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00a7 1.8)      \nThe '913 patent asserted in this case is entitled \u201cDiclofenac Topical Formulation\u201d and it \nis a continuation of the '838 patent.  ( D.I. 1, ex. A; D.I. 32 at 4 & n.1)  The ' 913 patent issued \nfrom United States Patent Application No. 14/497,096 (the \u201c '096 application\u201d).  (D.I. 1, ex. A)   \nThe '096 application was filed by Nuvo on September 25, 2014.  ( Id.; D.I. 33, ex. 4 at 5)   \nOn October 17, 2014\u2014le ss than a month after Nuvo filed the '096 application\u2014Nuvo \nand Horizon entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (\u201cAPA\u201d) by which Horizon acquired \nPENNSAID\u00ae 2% and Nuvo\u2019s related patent rights.  ( D.I. 33, ex. 6)  The intellectual property \nthat Horizon purch ased included the '096 application (and the '838 patent) .  (Id., ex. 7 at 4 Schedule 1 )  The '096 application later issued to Horizon as the '913 patent on June 30, 2015.  \n(D.I. 1, ex. A)2 \nOn August 4, 2020, Apotex received tentative approval from the United States Food and \nDrug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) for its generic PENNSAID \u00ae 2% product  (the \u201cApotex 2.0% \nProduct\u201d) .  (D.I. 33, ex. 9)  The FDA informed Apotex that it was \u201cunable to grant fina l \napproval to [A potex\u2019s Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u2018ANDA\u2019)] \u201d because \u201c[p]rior to the \nsubmission of [Apotex\u2019s] ANDA, another applicant . . . submitted a substantially complete \nANDA\u201d for a generic PENNSAID \u00ae 2% product.  ( Id. at 3)  Accordingly, the FD A stated that \nApotex\u2019s ANDA would be eligible for final approval on a date that is 180 days following the \ncommercial marketing date by a first filer.  ( Id.)   \nAt the time, Actavis held first -filer status for generic PENNSAID\u00ae 2%.  (See D.I. 32 at \n7; D.I. 52 at 2)   However, on May 5, 2022, Actavis\u2019s first -filer status was \u201c [e]xtinguished.\u201d  \n(D.I. 33, ex. 10)  As a result, on May 6, 2022, Apotex receive d FDA approval to market its \ngeneric PENNSAID \u00ae 2% product and immediately launched its Apotex 2.0% Product .  (Id., ex. \n11; see also D.I. 32 at 7; D.I. 52 at 8)    \nAdditional relevant facts will be set out as necessary in Section III below.   \nB.  Procedural Background  \nHorizon commenced this action on May 13, 2022.  (D.I. 1)  Apotex filed the instant  \nMotion on June 24, 2022.  (D.I. 31)3  The Motion was fully briefed as of July 29, 2022.  (D.I. 64)   \n \n2  The '838 and '913 patents share the same specification describing the invention \ndiscussed therein, and they have the same title, abstract, and inventors.  (D.I. 69 at 1 n.2 (citing \nid., exs. 1- 2)) \n \n3  Four days after commencing this action, Horizon filed a motion for pr eliminary \ninjunction.  (D.I. 7 )  Apotex  subsequently agreed to forego argument on preliminary injunction 5 The Court heard argument on the Motion on August 23, 2022.  ( D.I. 67 (hereinafter \u201cTr.\u201d))  The \nparties submitted supplemental letter briefs on August 30, 2022.  (D.I. 68; D.I. 69)  \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nSummary  judgment  is appropriate where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(a) .  The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine \nissue o f material fact.  See  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585 \nn.10 (1986) .  If the moving party has sufficiently demonstrated the absence of such a dispute, t he \nnonmovant must then \u201ccome forw ard with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.\u201d  Id.  at 587 (internal quotation marks, citation and emphasis omitted).  If the nonmoving \nparty fails to make a sufficient showing in this regard, then the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 322- 23 (1986) .  During this \nprocess, the Court will \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving par ty, and it \nmay not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\u201d   Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing \nProds., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000) . \nHowever, in order to defeat a motion for summary  judgment , the nonmoving pa rty must \n\u201cdo more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d  \nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 586.  The \u201cmere existence of some  alleged factual \ndispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary  \njudgment ; the requirement is that there be no genuine  issue of material  fact.\u201d  Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247- 48 (1986)  (emphasis in original).  Facts that could alter \n \nproceedings  and agreed to e ntry of such injunctive relief, and the parties agreed to litigate an \nearly summary judgment motion on Apotex\u2019s license defense.  (D.I. 21)  6 the outcome are \u201cmaterial,\u201d and a factual dispute is \u201cgenuine,\u201d only where \u201cthe evidence is such \nthat a reasonabl e jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d   Id. at 248.  \u201cIf the \nevidence is merely colorable . . . or is not significantly probative  . . . summary  judgment  may be \ngranted.\u201d   Id. at 249- 50 (internal citations omitted).  \nA party asserting that a fact cannot be\u2014or, alternatively, asserting that a fact is \u2014\ngenuinely disputed must support the assertion either by \u201c citing to particular parts of materials in \nthe record, including de positions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or \ndeclarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials ;\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do not  \nestablish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B) . \nIII.  DISCUSSIO N       \nApotex argues that through the 2013 Settlement Agreement, Nuvo granted Apotex a \nlicense to the '913 patent  that is binding on Horizon, and that this license defeats Horizon\u2019s \ninfringement claim as a matter of law.  (D.I. 32 at 2 , 18)\n4  Horizon retorts that the 2013 \nSettlement Agreement does not encumber the '913 patent \u2014a patent that did not exist  at the time \nof the settlement, and that  subsequently issued solely to Horizon.  (D.I. 52 at 1)   \nThe parties\u2019 positions  raise two key issues  that are important  not only to the outcome of \nthis case, but also more generally to the realm of patent licensing.  (D.I. 64 at 1 (Apotex arguing that \u201c[t]he ramifications of Horizon\u2019s [arguments] cannot be understated\u201d  and that those \n \n4  A license defense is an affirmative defense to a claim of patent infringement.  See, \ne.g., CXT Sys., Inc. v. Acad., Ltd., Case No. 2:18- cv-00171- RWS -RSP, 2020 WL 9936134, at *4 \n(E.D. Tex. Jan. 30, 2020) (citing McCoy v. Mitsuboshi Cutlery , Inc., 67 F.3d 917, 920 (Fed. Cir. \n1995)).   7 arguments are \u201cunpreced ented\u201d)) ; Tr. at 68- 69 (Horizon asserting that the \u201c [United States Court \nof Appeals for the] Federal Circuit has never addressed the issue that [the Court] is going to \naddress\u201d))   First, can a licensor ( here,  Nuvo) grant a license to a future continuation patent that \ndoes not ultimately issue to th at licensor , and instead issues to a third party (here, Horizon) ?  \nAnd second, if Nuvo can lawfully do so , does the 2013 Settlement Agreement utilize language  \nthat is  sufficient to accomplish th is?  The Court will address these issues in turn. \nA. Can a L icensor Ever G rant a L icense to a F uture Continuation P atent that \nDoes N ot Ultimately I ssue to that L icensor?  \n \nIn its briefing, H orizon\u2019s primary argument  appeared to be that Nuvo did not and could \nnot grant Apotex a license to  the '913 patent , because  that continuation patent did not issue to \nNuvo ( instead, it issued to Horizon in June 2015)  and thus Nuvo did not own it.  Hor izon\u2019s \nposition\u2014one that it continually repeated \u2014was that \u201cone cannot convey what one  does not \nown\u201d and therefore, \u201cNuvo cannot have given something to Apotex that Nuvo never owned in \nthe first place .\u201d  (D.I. 52 at 1- 2 (quoting TransCore, L P v. Elec. Transaction Cons ultants  Corp., \n563 F.3d 1271, 1275 (Fed. Cir. 2009)); see also id. at 2 ( \u201cAs it is undisputed that Nuvo . . . never \nowned or acquired the '913 patent, [it] could not license rights to the '913 patent to Apotex.\u201d ); id. \nat 10 (\u201cNuvo . . . never owned any exclusion rights under the '913 patent, which was prosecuted \nby and issued to Horizon.\u201d ) (emphasis omitted) ; id. at 16 n.8 (\u201c[T]he issue here is whether a \npatent license attaches to a new patent owned by a third party that was not owned by the \nlicensor.\u201d) )  In other words, in the above -referenced portions of its briefing, Horizon seemed \npretty clearly to be arguing that because the '913 patent did not issue to Nuvo, th is mean t that 8 under no circumstances  could Nuvo have  lawf ully license d rights  to that patent to Apotex\u2014full \nstop.5   \n However, during oral argument, Horizon stepped back a bit from this rather extreme \nposition.  Instead, there it acknowledged that a licensor can , in certain circumstances, grant a \nlicense to a future patent that does not ultimately issue to that licensor.  (Tr. at 75 -77, 79- 80)  To \nthat end, H orizon\u2019s counsel asserted that an entity could \u201cgrant a license to subject matter as a \nwhole [by licensing patent applications such that] whatever comes out of  that subject as a whole \nin a later patent , [the licensor is giving the licensee] a right to\u201d that  property .  (Id. at 76 ; see also \nid. at 80 -81 (Horizon \u2019s counsel  asserting that a licensor could convey a  license to \u201cgeneral \nsubject matter . . . . [a]nd whatever comes out of that general subject matter, if it issues as a \npatent, [the licensee] will get a . . . license to that\u201d patent) )6  But Horizon then argued that  the \n2013 Settlement Agreement simply does not accomplish thi s (an argument that the Court will \ntake up shortly below).  ( Id. at 82 , 84)   \n \n5  Apotex also seems to have understood that this was the  primary argument that \nHorizon was making in its  answering brief .  (D.I. 32 at 15 (\u201cHorizon has argued that because the \n'913 patent iss ued to Horizon, despite issuing from an application filed by Nuvo, Nuvo had no \nrights to license to Apotex.\u201d) ; see also  Apotex\u2019s Summary Judgment Presentation, Slide 10)     \n \n6  In fairness, there was one point in its answering brief  where Horizon seemed to  be \nnodding at the position it described more fully during oral argument.  On page 13 of its  \nanswering brief, Horizon noted that \u201cApotex\u2019s own licensing history . . . reflects that it knew it \ncould have negotiated (if Nuvo were willing to agree to it) broa der rights to \u2018patent applications,\u2019 \nand could have addressed [] applications that are transferred to a third party that prosecutes them to issuance.\u201d  (D.I. 52 at 13)   Horizon then pointed to a license agreement that Apotex struck \nwith Vanda Pharmaceuticals , in which the parties specified that \u201cpatent rights\u201d extended to \nparticular patents and \u201c the patent applications giving rise thereto\u201d and \u201call other relevant patents \nand pat ent applications\u201d covering the relevant products.  ( Id. at 13 -14 (quoting D.I. 53, ex. F  at \u00a7 \n1.10))  Unlike in that agreement, here, according to Horizon, \u201cApotex did not secure broader [rights] for itself[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 14)  \n 9 It makes sense that Horizon  gave up on the very broad argument it seemed to be making \nin its brief ing.  That is because the law  supports the principle that a l icensor can  grant a l icense to \na future continuation patent that does not ultimately i ssue to that l icensor .  (D.I. 32 at 15; Tr. at \n34)  The Court will next explain why this is so, both by looking to legal principles relating to \npatent licensing a nd by assessing relevant  Federal Circuit caselaw .7     \n The grant of a patent merely provides the patentee with the right to exclude others from \npracticing the invention; it does not provide the patentee with an affirmative right to practice the \npatent.  TransCore , 563 F.3d at 1275 (citing 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(a)(1)).  It follows that the grant of a \nnon-exclusive patent license is, in essence, a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee.  Id.  \nat 1275- 76.  And  because \u201cthe owner of a patent cannot transfer an interest greater than that \nwhich it possesses\u201d \u2014i.e., because one cannot convey what one does not own\u2014an assignee of a \npatent takes that patent subject to the patent\u2019s legal encumbrances, including any prev iously-\nissued licenses .  Datatreasury Corp. v. Wells Fargo & Co., 522 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. \n2008) .  In other words, while the assignment of patent rights may alter the owner ship of those \nrights, such an assignment cannot expand those rights , and thus the assignee of a patent is bound \nby prior licenses issued  with respect  to that patent.  See id.; Ira Svendsgaard & Assoc., Inc. v. \nAllFasteners USA, LLC , Case No. 1:20 CV 328, 2021 WL 4502798, at *3 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 1, \n2020) ; Innovus Prime, LLC v. Panasonic Corp., Case No. C -12-00660- RMW, 2013 WL \n \n7  It is undisputed here that Delaware law applies to the interpretation of the 2013 \nSettlement Agreement.  (D.I. 32 at 8; D.I. 52 at 8)  The law of the Federal Circuit, meanwhile, \ngoverns issues involved in the substance of enforcement of a patent right , such as the effect of a \npatent  license grant .  See, e.g., Amana Refrigeration, Inc. v. Quadlux, Inc., 172 F.3d 852, 856 \n(Fed. Cir. 1999); Cardiovascular Sys., Inc. v. Cardio Flow, Inc., 498 F. Supp. 3d 1080, 1090 (D. \nMinn. 2020) ; (Tr. at 22 -23, 108- 09). 10 3354390, at *5 (N.D. Cal. July 2, 2013) .  This is true even if the assignee was unaware of a prior \nlicense agreement.  Innovus Prime , 2013 WL 3354390, at *5.      \n In light of these principles, Apotex contends that if it has a license t o the '913 patent via \nthe 2013 Settlement Agreement , then that license is binding on Horizon (even though Horizon \nwas not a party to the 2013 Settlement Agreement) because the license runs with the patent .  \n(D.I. 32 at 1, 14; D.I. 64 at 6)  That is, Apotex\u2019s argument is that because Nuvo could not have \nsued it for infringement of the '913 patent under the terms of the agreement, then neither can \nHorizon.  And Apotex asserts that its license right would not evaporate simply because that patent ultimately issued to Horizon instead of Nuvo.  (D.I. 32 at 1)   \nAs noted above, in its briefing, Horizon \u2019s prime retort was  that Nuvo could not have \nlicensed the '913 patent to Apotex since \u201cNuvo never owned [that patent] in the first place. \u201d  \n(D.I. 52 at 1)   The caselaw counsels otherwise.  (See D.I. 32 at 15; D.I. 64 at 6; Tr. at 25- 26)   \n More specifically, the Federal Circuit \u2019s decision in Intel Corp. v. Negotiated Data \nSolutions , Inc., 703 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2012) is  particularly  helpful  here.  Intel clearly indicates \nthat, at least  in certain circumstances , a licensor can  issue a license to a future -issued  patent, \neven if that patent issues to  someone other than the licensor .  (D.I. 32 at 15; D.I. 64 at 4; Tr. at \n25-26, 34, 115)   Because Intel  is a key  case, the Court will now  discuss it in some detail.   \nIn Intel, Intel Corp. (\u201cIntel\u201d) and Negotiated Data Solutions, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cN -Data\u201d) \npredecess or-in-interest, National  Semiconductor Corp. (\u201cNational\u201d) , entered into a patent cross -\nlicensing agreement  (the \u201cNational Agreement\u201d) in 1976.  Intel , 703 F.3d at 1361.  The National \nAgreement gave Intel a non -exclusive license to patents ( the \u201cNational Patents\u201d) that National \nowned and that had first effective filing dates before the license agreement.  Id.  at 1361- 62.  In \n1998, National assigned four  of the National Patents (the \u201cOriginal Patents\u201d ) to Vertical 11 Networks, Inc. (\u201cVertical\u201d) .  Id. at 1362.  The reafter , between 1998 and 1999, Vertical filed \nbroadening reissue applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) for \nthree of the Original Patents ; through these reissue applications, Vertical increased the total \nnumber of claims in the three patents from 77 to 378.  Id.8  Vertical subsequently assigned the \nOriginal Patents and the reissue applications to N -Data.  Id.   Following the expiration of the \nNational Agreement in  2003, the reissue patents corresponding to the three Original Patents (the \n\u201cReissue Patents\u201d) issued to N -Data.  Id.   N-Data thereafter  sued Dell, Inc. (\u201cDell\u201d) , a customer \nof Intel, alleging infringement of, inter alia , the Reissue Patents.  Id.   In response, Intel sought a \ndeclaratory judgment that, pursuant to the National Agreement, Intel and its customers were licensed to the National Patents as well as to a ll Reissue P atents owned by N -Data that were \nderived from any of the National Patents.  Id.    \nIntel and N -Data filed cross -motions for summary judgment on the issue .  Id.  Intel \nargued that the National Agreement \u201cnaturally extends to reissue patents that derive from \nNational Patents\u201d  such that the R eissue P atents should be treated as National Patents that were \nlicensed to Intel under the agreement.  Id.  N -Data , for its part, argu ed that \u201cthe Reissue Patents \nare separate patents that cover unique property rights distinct from the rights covered by the Original Patents \u201d and because the Reissue Patents \u201cwere issued dire ctly to N -Data after the \n[National] Agreement had expired, they are not National Patents and are not licensed to Intel.\u201d  \nId.  The district co urt ultimately agreed with Intel, concluding that the intent of Intel and \n \n8  With a reissue patent, a patentee may correct an erro r in a patent that renders the \npatent wholly or partly inoperative or invalid, or in a patent where the patentee claimed more or \nless than he had a right to claim ; nevertheless, a reissue patent must still be based on \u201cthe \ninvention disclosed in the original patent\u201d and may not introduce \u201cnew matter[.]\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251. \n 12 National in the National Agreement was to \u201cgrant broad rights to all patents owned or controlled \nby the other party for the lif e of the patents . . . and avoid future infringement suits.\u201d  Id.  at 1363 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).9   \nOn appeal, the Federal Circuit affirm ed.  The Intel Court first considered the parties\u2019 \ncompeting arguments regarding the statute governing the effect of reissue patents, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 (\u201cSection 252\u201d) .  In support of its position that  the license grant in the National Agreement \nonly covered the Original Patents and not the Reissue Patents, N -Data had argued that a reissue \npatent \u201ci s a distinct property right that does not simply replace the original patent in an existing \nagreement.\u201d  Id.  at 1364.  And i n support of its contrary argument that the National Agreement \nextend ed to the Reissue Patents, Intel \u2019s position was that:  (1)  Sect ion 252 provide s that a reissue \npatent takes the place of the original patent nunc pro tunc , \u201cas if the reissued patent had been \nissued at the time of, and instead of, the original\u201d ; and so (2) the Reissue Patents should be \ntreated as if they were the Orig inal Patents (which were licensed to Intel).  Id.  In addressing this \npoint, the Federal Circuit disagreed with Intel, explain ing that Section 252 makes it clear \u201cthat a \nreissue patent does not simply replace an original patent nunc pro tunc .\u201d  Id.   \nThe Intel Court next w ent on to consider whether the \u201cNational Agreement itself is \nproperly interpreted . . . to extend the license granted thereunder t o the Reissue Patents.\u201d  Id.  at \n1364- 65.  The Federal Circuit explained that the statute governing the reissue of defective \npatents, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251, establishe d that a reissue p atent issues \u201cfor the invention  disclosed in \nthe original patent\u201d and prohibit s the addition of \u201cnew matter\u201d in the reissue patent.  Id.  at 1366 \n \n9  California law applied to the inte rpretation of the National Agreement, which \nrequires that a contract be interpreted to give effect to the parties\u2019 mutual i ntent.  Intel , 703 F.3d \nat 1365.  13 (quoting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251) ( certain emphasis omitted).   It found that this  language signals to \npotential licensees that \u2014in the absence of language in a licensing agreement to the contrary \u2014a \nlicense to a patent that is not directed to any specific claims  \u201cwill extend to the full extent of \nprotection provided by law to the invention which is the subject of that patent .\u201d  Id.  (emphasis \nadded).  And so the Intel Court  found it reasonable that Intel\u2019s and National\u2019s mutual intent when \nthey entered into the National Agreement \u201cwas that the broad and unrestricted grant of license \nunder National Patents extended to any reissues thereof.\u201d  Id.    \nIn reaching this decision, th e Intel Court explained that two prior decisions by the Federal \nCircuit\u2014in which the Court \u201canalyzed a licensee\u2019s rights when the patent holder received a continuation patent that, if asserted against the licensee, would derogate from the licensee\u2019s right to practice the previously licensed patents\u201d\u2014supported the Court\u2019s conclusion.  Id.   These cases, \nTransCore , LP v. Elec. Tr ansaction Consultants Corp., 563 F.3d 1271 (Fed. Cir. 2009) and Gen. \nProtecht Grp., Inc. v. Leviton Mfg. Co., 651 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir . 2011) , established that allowing \nthe patentee to sue on subsequent patents  that \u201ccontain the same inventive subject matter that \nwas licensed[] risks derogating rights for which the licensee has paid consideration.\u201d  Intel , 703 \nF.3d at 1366.\n10  The  Intel Court explained that t he same concern applies to situations involving \nreissue patents \u201cwhere the full extent of an invention disclosed in a patent is licensed[ .]\u201d  Id.  at \n1366- 67.  While the National Agreement did not expressly mention any reissue patents, the \n \n10  In these two cases, t he Federal Circuit ruled that absen t a clear indication of \nmutual intent to the contrary, an express license to a patent also includes an implied license to \ncontinuation patents, even if those patents issue subsequent to the license agreement, because the same inventive subject matter is disclosed  in both patents .  Gen. Protecht Grp., 651 F.3d at 1361; \nTransCore , 563 F.3d at 1278- 79; see also  Cheetah Omni LLC v. AT&T Servs., Inc., 949 F.3d \n691, 695- 96 (Fed. Cir. 2020).   14 Court noted that the license grant therein to the National Patents was without limitation, as it d id \nnot reference any specific claims  of those patents .  Id. at 1367.  Therefore, the Court concluded:  \nThe [National] Agreement thus evinces the pa rties\u2019 intent that the \nlicense so granted extend not only to the claims then in existence \nbut also to the full scope of any coverage available by way of \nreissue for the invention disclosed.  To interpret the [National] Agreement otherwise would allow the unilateral act of the licensor to place the licensee, which sought to eliminate any infringement risk and effect a global peace with the licensor for all claims in all patents, in a position of being exposed to further risk relating to the exact same invent ions that were subject to the license.  \n \nId. (emphasis added).   \n In sum, the Intel Court found that pursuant to the National Agreement , National  had the \nright to and did license to Intel  patents :  (1) that were not expressly referenced in that a greement ; \nand (2) that issued subsequent to the agreement ; to (3) N -Data, a  non-party  to the agreement.   \nImportantly, t he Federal Circuit was not bothered by the fact that t he Reissue Patents issued \ndirectly to N -Data ( and not to National , the licensor ).  (See Tr. at 43 -44)  Rather, the Court \nsought to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties to the National Agreement \u2014National and \nIntel\u2014in finding that National had the right to and did grant a license to the ful l scope of the  \ninvention described in the National Patents,  such that  the agreement :  (1) encompassed \nsubsequent reissue patents covering the  inventive subject matter  described in the National \nPatents ; and (2) protected the licensee\u2019s ability to practice that subject matter .  (Id. at 44)\n11  Cf. \n \n11  Horizon argues that a predecessor case to Intel , Intergraph Corp. v. Intel Corp., \n241 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001) , is more on point than Intel and shows that Apotex\u2019s reading of \nthe law is wrong.  (D.I. 52 at 10- 11; Tr. at 69, 95- 96, 109)   In Intergraph, the Federal Circuit \nreversed the lower court\u2019s grant of summary judgment that Intel was licensed to practice the inventions of Intergraph Corporation\u2019s (\u201cIntergraph\u201d) patents (the \u201cClipper patents\u201d).  Intergraph, 241 F.3d at 1353.  Intergraph, Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. (\u201cFairchild\u201d) and \nNational Semiconductor Company (\u201c National \u201d) had entered into an agreement under which \nNational would purchase Fairchild and immediately cause Fairchild to sell a portfolio including 15 Hollister Inc. v. ConvaTec Inc ., Case No. 10 C 6431, 2011 WL 13193423, at *1, *5 (N.D. Ill. \nJuly 5, 2011) (concluding that a release agreement between the defendant and a prior owner of \nthe patent s-in-suit defeated claims of infringement, even though the patents\u2019 applications were \nfiled by the prior owner but the patents had subsequently issued to the plaintiff).   \nHorizon attempts to distinguish Intel on the ground that in that case, the newly -asserted \npatents at issue were reissue  patents  that issued from existing licensed patents .  In this regard, \nHorizon suggests that  Intel  turned on the fact that \u201ca reissue is a correction of an issued \npatent\u201d\u2014and that, as a legal matter, there was \u201cno difference\u201d between the Reissue Patents and \nthe Original P atents  in Intel , because the law \u201ctreats the [R] eissue [] patents . . . the same as  the \n \nthe Clipper patent applications to Inte rgraph upon closing.  Id.  at 1354.  Intel had a cross -license \nagreement with National at the time , and it argued that because National acquired control of the \nClipper patent applications immediately before they were transferred to Intergraph, the  \napplications  were covered by the cross -license agreement .  Id. at 13 54-55.  The Court rejected \nIntel\u2019s argument, explaining that:  (1) the National/Intel cross -license agreement  provided a \nlicense to National patent applicati ons tha t, \u201cwhen issued, w ill become\u201d N ational Patents; and (2) \nthis provision was not met , even though National \u201cmomentarily possessed\u201d the Clipper patent \napplications on the day of the closing before the deal was complete , because n othing in the \ncontract supported the interpretation that the parties intended that \u201cunknown persons might \nacquire a free license from National during the hour of closing.\u201d  Id.  at 1355- 56.   \n Nothing in Intergraph suggests that a patentee cannot, under any circumstances, license \nrights to a patent that ultimately issues to another entity.  Instead, the license decision in Intergraph turned on the particular language found in the license agreement at issue.  In  \nIntergraph, the actual wording of that agreement ma de it clear that the purported licensor \n(National) simply had not  licensed the patent applications at issue to the purported licensee \n(Intel) , in light of the fact that National only held the applications mome ntarily as part of the \ncorporate transaction at issue .  (D.I. 64 at 4); see also Intel , 703 F.3d at 1365 (\u201cIn this regard \nIntergraph is inapposite \u2014that case only dealt with whether or not the National Agreement \ncovered patent applications held momentarily by National as part of a corporate transaction in which a subsidiary possessed the applications but then immediately sold them, such that the applications never issued as National Patents.\u201d).  In contrast, as the Court will explain in more \ndetail below, he re the language  in the 2013 Settlement Agreement supports Apotex\u2019s claim to a \nlicense to the '913 patent .   \n  16 [O]riginal [P]atents[.]\u201d   (D.I. 52 at 15- 16; Tr. at 70, 72; see also  Tr. at 64- 65; D.I. 68 at 1 & \nn.1)12  Put differently, Horizon\u2019s argument i s that in Intel :  (1) since National had licensed the \nOriginal Patents to Intel and (2)  since there is purportedly no real legal difference between the \nOriginal Patents and the Reissue Patents ; then (3) that is why it was determined that National had \nalso licensed Intel to the Reissue Patents too (even though those Reissue P atents did not \ntechnically issue until years after the license grant, and when they did, they issued to a party \nother than National , the licensor ).  As was noted above, w e are not dealing with a reissue patent \nin this cas e; the '913 patent is a continuation of the '838 pat ent.  And so for this reason, Horizon \nsuggests that Intel  should have no impact here.  (D.I. 52 at 15- 16)   \nThe Court  is not persuaded that any distinction between reissue patents and continuation \npatents13 should lessen its reliance on Intel or make a dif ference to  its analysis .  (See Tr. at 70- 71 \n(Horizon \u2019s counsel  agreeing that if there \u201cwas no difference between a continuation and a \nreissue\u201d patent for purposes of the Court\u2019s analysis of Intel , then Intel  would \u201creally help\u201d \n \n12  Horizon further suggests that the Federal Circuit\u2019s holding in Intel should have no \nbearing on the Court\u2019s decision here because in that case, Vertical acquired assets from National \n\u201csubject to any existing licenses and other encumbrances that [the assignor] may have granted or obligated itself . . . includ[ ing] broad cross licenses.\u201d  (D.I. 52 at 16  (internal quotation marks, \ncitations and emphasis omitted); Tr. at 67 -68)  However, the  Intel Court never mentioned this \nfact in its opinion, and it thus does not appear that this particular bit of contractual language \nimpacted t he Court\u2019s decision in any way.  ( See Tr. at 67- 68) \n  \n13  A continuation application must be filed while a previously filed patent \napplication remains pending, in order for the continuation to get the same priority date as the prior application.  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120; In re Staats , 671 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2012) .  A reissue \napplication  may be filed at any time after a patent issues, except that if a reissue application \nbroadens the scope of the claims, it must be filed within two years from the date that the original patent issued .  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(d).  \n 17 provide an answer to the Court regarding this dispute))   The Court so concludes for a couple of \nreasons.  \nFor one  thing, the Intel Court rejected the  argument that a reissue patent simply takes the \nplace of the original patent , as if the original patent had  never existed.  Intel , 703 F.3d at 1364.  \nTo the contrary, Intel makes clear  that a  reissue patent  \u201cdoes not simply replace \u201d an original \npatent ; the Federal Circuit noted that a reissue patent is a distinct property right  from an original \npatent that may , inter alia , have a different claim  scope as compared to the original patent .  Id.   \nMoreover, Intel explains that the Federal Circuit \u2019s holding there would apply equally to \nsituations involving subsequently issued continua tion patents  \u201cwhere the full extent of an \ninvention disclosed in a [prior] patent is licensed .\u201d  Id. at 1366- 67.  In deed, Intel expressly says  \nthat allowing the patent holder to sue on later -issued  patents in such a scenario risks derogating \nthe rights of the licensee  \u201cregardless of whether the case involves reissue patents or continuation \npatents.\u201d   Id.  And it makes good sense that the rationale expressed in Intel  would apply to a \ncontinuation patent issuing f rom an originally- licensed patent \u2014be cause a continuation patent \nissues from a continuation application , which  \u201cis an application for the invention(s)  disclosed in \na prior -filed copending nonprovisional application[ .]\u201d  MPEP \u00a7 201.07 (emphasis added).  Just  \nas is the case with reissue patents, see 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251, \u201c[t] he disclosure presented in the \ncontinuation must not include any subject matter which would constitute  new matter  if submitted \nas an amendment to the parent application [,]\u201d MPEP \u00a7 201.07 (emphasis added) ; see also Intel , \n703 F.3d at 1366 (emphasizing that continuation patents a re \u201cbased on the same disclosure  as\u201d \nprevious patents and by definition \u201c\u2018 can claim no new invention not already supported in the \nearlier issued patents \u2019\u201d) (quoting Gen. Protecht Grp., 651 F.3d at 1361)  (certain emphasis \nadded) ; see also Endo Pharms. Inc. v. Actavis, Inc. , 746 F.3d 1371, 1374 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2014) 18 (\u201cThe continuation [patent] must . . . have the same disclosure as the prior patent.\u201d) ; (D.I. 69 at 2; \nTr. at 38 -39).14   \n \n14  In its supplemental letter brief , Horizon argued that a continuation patent is \ntreated as \u201cseparate \u201d and \u201cdistinct\u201d property from an original parent patent , and \u201cha[s its]  own \nclaims and  [its] own exclusion rights.\u201d  (D.I. 68 at 1- 2)  T herefore, according to Horizon, the fact \nthat the '913 patent is a continuat ion of the '838 patent should be irrelevant to the Court\u2019s \nanalysis with respect to the instant dispute.  ( Id.)   \n \nIt is true that courts have treated continuation patents as conveying \u201c separate\u201d  property \nrights from parent patents.  See, e.g., ACC Climate  Control v. Bergstrom, Inc., Ca use No. 3:07-\nCV-125-TS, 2010 WL 746750, at *2 (N.D. Ind. Mar. 2, 2010) (denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to \nsupplement its complaint to add continuation patents of patents already in the case , and noting \nthat \u201ceach patent is by  definition \u2018new,\u2019 and is legally protected separately from any other \npatent\u201d) ( cited in D.I. 68 at 1) .  This makes sense, in that  every continuation patent is going to \nhave different claims than those in its  parent patent ( claims that may be broader, narrower or \nrelated to another aspect of the invention that the inventor claimed in the original application).  See Hakim v. Cannon Avent Grp., PLC , 479 F.3d 1313, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ; (D.I. 69 at 1).  \nAnd s o in that sense, the continuation patent is a \u201cseparate\u201d or \u201cdistinct\u201d patent/property right as \ncompared to the parent patent.   (Tr. at 71)  In Intel , N-Data noted this fact and tried to use it in \nsupport of a  similar argument to the one Horizon makes here\u2014i.e., N -Data asser ted that the \nreissue patents that issued to it, and not to National, constituted \u201c distinct\u201d  property rights  as \ncompared to the patents from which they descended.  Intel , 703 F.3d at 1364; see also , e.g., Eby \nv. King, 158 U.S. 366, 373 (1895) (\u201c[I]f a reissue is granted, the patentee has no rights except such as grow out of the reissued patent.  He has none under the original.  That is extinguished.\u201d) .  \nBut even though this  was so, what was ultimately important to the Intel Court was that the \nreissued p atent necessarily relates  to the  invention that w as disclosed in the original patent itself.  \nIn light of this, Intel  held that a licensor could license a future reissue patent  to a third party, even \nif the reissue patent actually ended up issu ing to another entity , so long as the licensor owned the \nrights to the patent from which the reissued patent descended, and so long as the language of the license agreement at issue \u201cevinces an intent\u201d to do so.  Intel , 703 F.3d at 1365, 1367.   \n The Court further notes here that the implied license doctrine , described above , see supra  \nn.10, underscores how tied together continuation patents and parent patents are in the licensing context.  Indeed, Apotex argues that to the extent it does not have an e xpress license to the '913 \npatent, it has an implied license thereto pursuant to this doctrine.  (D.I. 32 at 10- 13)  T he Court \nneed not address this argument in light of its finding below that Apotex has an express licens e.  \nBut the implied license doctrine does emphasize the fact that continuation patents have the same \ndisclosure as their prior patents, which is significant when it comes to patent licensing issues  like \nthe ones at  play  in this case .   19 In the end, Intel tells us that i t is legally  possible  for a licensor to grant a license to a \nfuture continuation patent that does not ultimately issue to that licensor  (and instead issues to a \nthird party) .  This is  because if the licensor owns a parent pa tent at the time it executes a license \nagreement, then the licensor  necessarily has the legal ability to promise freedom from suit as to \nthe invention dis closed in  that patent .  The licensor  thus can, if it wishes, extend a license to a \nfuture -issued continuation patent , so that the licensee will know it is free from suit in the future \nas to that continuation patent \u2014even if the continuation patent ultimately later  issues to a third \nparty.  \nUnderstanding all of this, t he Court next turns to whether the language of the 2013 \nSettlement Agreement  actually provided Apotex with a license to the '913 patent .   \nB. Does the 2013 Settlement Agreement U tilize L anguage S ufficient to G rant a \nLicense to a F uture Continuation P atent that D oes N ot Ultimately I ssue to \nthe Original L icensor?  \n \nAs noted above, Delaware law applies to the interpretation of the 2013 Settlement \nAgreement.  \u201cDelaware law adheres to the objective theory of contracts,\u201d which means that \u201ca \ncontract\u2019s construction should be that which would be understood by an objective, reasonable \nthird party.\u201d  TQ Delta, LLC v. ADTRAN, Inc., Civil Action No. 14- 954-RGA, Civil Action No. \n15-121-RGA, 2019 WL 3304705, at *3 (D. Del. July 23, 2019)  (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted) ; Salamone v. Gorman, 106 A.3d 354, 367- 68 (Del. 2014).  Pursuant to this \nstandard, a court must \u201cgive priority to the parties\u2019 i ntentions as reflected in the four corners of \nthe agreement, construing the agreement as a whole and giving effect to all its provisions.\u201d   \nSalamone , 106 A.3d at 368 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .  When a motion for \nsummary judgment prese nts a contract dispute implicating Delaware law, the threshold inquiry is \nwhether the contract is ambiguous.  TQ Delta, LLC , 2019 WL 3304705, at *3; United Rentals, 20 Inc. v. RAM Holdings, Inc., 937 A.2d 810, 830 (Del. Ch. 2007).  A contract is ambiguous if it is \n\u201cfairly susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.\u201d  TQ Delta , LLC , 2019 WL \n3304705, at *3 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Here, i t is undisputed that the \nrelevant terms of the 2013 Settlement Agreement are not ambiguous.  (D.I. 32 at 9; D.I. 52 at 1; Tr. at 19, 23, 107)  \nThe key remaining question is whether the 2013 Settlement Agreement e vince s the intent \nof the parties  to that agre ement \u201c that the license s o granted extend not only to the claims then in \nexistence but also to the full scope of any covera ge available by way of [continuation patents] for \nthe invention disclosed[?]\u201d  Intel , 703 F.3d at 1367.  The answer  to that question is a very clear \nyes.   \nAs an initial matter, the language of the Section 1. 8 could not be more explicit in defin ing \nthe \u201c '838 Licensed P atent \u201d to expressly include , in addition to the '838 patent itself, \u201c any patents \nthat issue from any  divisions, continuations , reissues or reexaminations thereof .\u201d  (D.I. 33, ex. 2 \nat \u00a7 1.8 (emphasis added) )  That language clearly means that, inter alia , if a patent were to issue \nin the future from a continuation application of the '838 patent, then  the parties intended that this \nfuture patent would be included in the definition of \u201c '838 Licensed Patent.\u201d  (Tr. at 111- 12)\n15   \nNext, turning to the license grant itself, Section 6.1 grants to Apotex a license, inter alia , \nto the \u201c'8 38 Licensed Patent ,\u201d which, as we know from the definition set out in Section 1.8, \nincludes a license to any patents that issue from any continuation applications of the '838 \n \n15  While Section 1. 8 does not include the word \u201capplication\u201d after \u201ccontinuation[,]\u201d \nas Apotex\u2019s counsel pointed out, it has to mean that \u2014obviously a patent would \u201c issue from a [] . . \n.  continuation[]\u201d  application.  (Tr. at 111- 12)  \n 21 patent .16  Thus, the 2013 Settlement Agreement makes evident that its  parties inten ded for the \nlicense grant to extend to the '913 patent, which undisputedly issued from a continuation \napplication of the '838 patent.   \nHorizon pushes back on this conclusion in a few ways , which the Court will address in \nturn. \nFirst, Horizon argues that S ection 6.1\u2019s license grant t o \u201cany other patent that [ Nuvo and \nMallinckrodt ] now own or that they may acquire in the future\u201d limits the scope of all licenses \ngranted in the agreement to \u201cissued patents that were owned or later acquired by Nuvo\u201d ; since \nNuvo never  owned the '913 patent, Horizon argues that  this part of Section 6.1 means that  the \npatent  is not covered by the 2013 Settlement Agreement.  (D.I. 52 at 1- 2, 9-10; D.I. 68 at 2; Tr. \nat 62, 64, 88)  That is not a persuasive reading of Section 6.1.  That section grants a license, inter \nalia, \u201cto the '838 Licensed Patent\u201d  (which we know from Section 1.8 includes any patents that  \nissue from any continuations thereof ) \u201cand to any  other  patent  that [Nuvo and Mallinckrodt] now \nown or that they may acquir e in the future, sufficient to allow Apotex to make, have made, use, \nsell, offer to sell, import, and distribute the Apotex 2.0% Product [.]\u201d  (D.I. 33 , ex. 2 at \u00a7\u00a7 1.8 &  \n6.1 (emphasis added))   The grant to any \u201c other patent \u201d that Nuvo now owns or may acquire in \nthe future is clearly a grant that is in addition to\u2014 i.e, separate and apart from \u2014the license grant \nrelating to the  \u201c'838 Licensed P atent. \u201d  (D.I. 64 at 2- 3; Tr. at 63- 64)   \nNext, Horizon highlights  the fact s that:  (1 ) the language of Section 6.1 provides  a license \n\u201cunder [Nuvo]\u2019s respective rights in and to . . . the '838 Licensed Patent\u201d ; and (2) a \u201cwhereas\u201d \nclause found at the beginning of the agreement provides  that \u201cWHEREAS, Nuvo owns \u201d the '838 \n \n16  The license grant is not limited to any particula r claims of the '838 patent \u2014it is \nlicensing the entire invention  referenced  therein.   22 patent .  (Horizon\u2019s  Summary Judgment Presentation, Slides 1 -2 (citing D.I. 33, ex. 2 at 1, \u00a7 6.1)  \n(certain emphasis in original) )  Horizon  suggests that these two contractual provisions also \ndemonstrate that the scope of the license is limited to patents that Nuvo owns .  (Id.; see also  D.I. \n52 at 9- 10)  Of course , Nuvo did own t he '838 patent at the time of the 2013 Settlement \nAgreement , and this contractual language c ertainly reflects that fact.  B ut Section 6.1\u2019s license \ngrant implicated the \u201crights [that Nuvo had] in  and to . . . the '838 Licensed Patent [,]\u201d and \nSection 1.8 defined the \u201c '838 Licensed Patent\u201d to include future patents that issue from \ncontinuation applications of the '838 patent .  (D.I. 33, ex. 2 at \u00a7\u00a7 1.8, 6.1)  A nd as noted above, \nat the time of the 2013 Settlement Agreement, Nuvo did \u201cown[]\u201d and have certain legal  \u201crights\u201d \nto the full scope of the invention disclosed in the '838 patent \u2014such that it had the lawful ability \nto grant a license not just to the '838 patent itself , but also to what would ultimately become the \n'913 patent.17  So nothing about these contractual provisions \u2014and their focus on Nuvo\u2019s \u201crights\u201d \nor the intellectual property that Nuvo \u201cowns\u201d \u2014alters the Court\u2019s decision here.  \nLastly, during oral argument, Horizon\u2019s chief contention was that:  (1)  while it w ould \nhave been possible for Nuvo to lawfully grant Apotex a license to the '913 patent ( even though \nthat patent ultimately issued to Horizon ); (2) to do so, Nuvo would have had to expressly license \n \n17  While Section 6.1\u2019s license grant  (i.e., to any other patent s that Nuvo \u201c now \nown[s] or [] may acquire in the future , sufficient to allow Apotex to make [and] sell  . . . the \nApotex 2.0% Product \u201d) does not limit the 2013 Settlement Agreement in the way that Horizon \nwishes, it does help to further demonstrate the intent of the parties to that Agreement.  (D.I. 33, \nex. 2 at \u00a7 6.1)  That is, it helps to show that the partie s\u2019 intent was to \u201cresolve any future disputes \nin connection with\u201d Apotex\u2019s 2.0% Product  by granting licenses to the '078 and '838 patents (and \nto any patents issuing from any divisions, continuations, reissues or reexaminations of those \npatents), as well as to any other  unidentified patent that Nuvo might then or later own that related \nto Apotex\u2019s ability to make and sell its 2.0% Product .  (D.I. 33, ex. 2 at 2; see Tr. at 31- 33)  \nThus, this  was intended to be a broad license grant; Horizon\u2019s narrow view of the license at issue \ndoes not gibe with that intent.   23 the application t hat matured into that later patent ; but (3) Nuvo did not do this in the 2013 \nSettlement Agreement (i.e., it did not grant a license to, for example any \u201ccontinuation \napplication  of the '838 patent\u201d ) and (4) instead, via  Section 1.8, Nuvo only licensed \u201c any patents \nthat issue from any . . . continuations \u201d of the '838 patent .  (Tr. at 72 -73 (Horizon\u2019s counsel \narguing that \u201c the '913 patent is an issued patent [but] the agreement doesn\u2019t transfer any license \nto patent applications \u201d) (emphasis added) ; id. at 85  (Horizon\u2019s counsel asserting  that the 2013 \nSettlement Agr eement\u2019s licensing provisions did not help Apotex due to the agreement\u2019s failure \nto \u201creference the patent application\u201d that led to the '913 patent)  (emphasis added) ; see also id . at \n77, 81, 86, 89)  Horizon argues that only if  Nuvo had grant ed Apotex a license to the patent \napplication that led to the '913 patent, would Nuvo be \u201clicensing the subject matter  [later \nclaimed in the '913 patent] through [its license to the] patent application[ .]\u201d  (Id. at 74 ; see also \nid. at 79- 80)    \nWhat does Hor izon point to in support of th is argument?  It mainly cites to the decision \nof the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (\u201cDistrict of Delaware\u201d) in \nCornell Univ. v. Illumina, Inc., C.A. No. 10- 433-LPS- MPT, 2014 WL 12601516 (D. Del. Sept. \n29, 2014).  ( Id. at 82- 83, 109; see also D.I. 52 at 10)   According to Horizon, Cornell  stands for \nthe notion that a licensor  would need to license a patent application in order to also lawfully \nlicense a subsequent patent that does not actually issue to the licensor.  (Tr. at 83)   \nIn Cornell , the District of Delaware  rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the asserted \npatents were subject to a covenant not to sue .  Cornell Univ., 2014 W L 12601516, at *4- 5.  The \ncovenant not to sue , which Applera Corporation (\u201cApplera\u201d) entered into with the defendant , \nIllumina, Inc. (\u201cIllumina\u201d) , provided Illumina with protection from suit for certain other \u201c patents  \n. . . owned or licensed by A pplera \u201d as of or after the effective date of a settlement agreement 24 between Applera and  Illumina.   Id. at *4 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted, \nemphasis added).  Meanwhile, at the time the Applera/Illumina agreement was signed, Applera \nhad a separate li cense agreement with t he plaintiff , Cornell University  (\u201cCornell\u201d), via which \nCornell had granted Applera an exclusive license for the \u201c [p]atent [a]pplications \u201d that \neventually resulted in the 10 asserted patents.   Id. (citation  omitted , emphasis added ).  Illumina \nargue d that Applera\u2019s exclusive license from Cornell  guaranteed that Applera would be protected \nfrom infringement from any patents that issued from the applications  referenced in the license \nagreement  (like the 10 asserted patents at issu e in the case), and thus that Illumina (through the \ncovenant not to sue it received from Applera) was similarly protected from suit as to those patents.  Id.   The Cornell  Court , compar ing the language of the covenant not to sue with that of \nthe exclusive license, disagreed that the two agreements were equally broad; it noted that the covenant not to sue did not include the phrase \u201cpatent applications.\u201d  Id.   The Court refused to \nread that term into the covenant not to sue, and concluded that \u201c[b]ecause Applera only ever had licenses to the patent applications  that resulted in the patents -in-suit, not the patents themselves,\u201d \nthe asserted patents were not subject to the covenant.  Id. (emphasis added).    \nSetting  aside whether Cornell was rightly decided, the decision  itself  does not support \nHorizon\u2019s position.  The circumstances  here are simply different  than those at play in Cornell .  \nThe covenant not to sue at issue in Cornell  merely covered patents , while the  exclusive license \ncovered  only patent applications , and so the Court would not read the latter in an expansive way \nso as to also include the asserted patents that resulted from those applications.  But here, in contrast, the 2013 Settlement Agreement expressly granted  to Apotex a license  to any patent that \nissues from any continuation application of the '838 patent .  The Court does not have to read in \nany language to reach this  conclusion\u2014the 2013 Settlement A greement flatly says this on its 25 face.  And Cornell  does not otherwise teach that in the circumstances at issue here, the 2013 \nSettlement Agreement would have had to expressly l icense the '096 application to Apotex in \norder for Apotex to have a license to the resulting '913 patent.      \nBeyond Cornell , Horizon relies upon an agreement (the \u201cVanda Agreement\u201d) that Apotex \nstruck with Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cVanda\u201d)  in support of the notion that Apotex could \nhave negotiated broader rights to patent applications if it wanted to (but did not do so here) .  \n(D.I. 52 at 13- 14; Tr. at 72 -73)  Section 1.10 of  the Vanda A greement defined patent rights as:  \n(a) certain listed patents and the \u201cpatent applications giving rise there to[;]\u201d (b) \u201call provisional \napplications, divisionals, continuations, continuations -in-part, reissues and renewals that claim \npriority to \u201d any applications in (a); ( c) \u201call patents that have issued or i n the future issue from \nany of the foregoing\u201d applications; and ( d) all other relevant patents and patent applications \nrelating to the products at issue in that agreement.  (D.I. 53, ex. F at \u00a7 1.10)   Horizon asserts that \n\u201c[t]he Vanda [A]greement that Apot ex entered into where Apotex was getting a right to the \nsubject matter, the patent applications and continuations[ ,] says clearly:  A ll patents that issue in \nthe future based on those applications. . . . that is what [Apotex] want [s] the [2013 Settlement \nAgreement] to read as. \u201d  (Tr. at 72- 73)   \nHorizon\u2019s reliance on the Vanda Agreement is not availing, for two  reasons.  First, \nDelaware law is clear that \u201c[i]f a contract is unambiguous, extrinsic evidence may not be used to \ninterpret the intent of the parties, to vary the terms of the contract or to create an ambiguity.\u201d  Eagle Indus., Inc. v. DeVilbiss Health Care, Inc., 702 A.2d 1228, 1232 (Del. 2022)  (citation \nomitted) .  Here, as the Court has noted above, the relevant terms of the 2013 Settlement \nAgreement are unambiguous .  Thus, the Vanda Agreement is extrinsic evidence that cannot have \na bearing on the outcome.  ( See Tr. at 113)  Second, as both parties acknowledge, while it is true 26 that a patent application can be licensed, \u201cit confers no substantive exclusion rights [.]\u201d  (D.I. 52 \nat 11;  D.I. 69 at 2 n.3; Tr. at 112)  A ccordingly, it remains unclear to the Court why Nuvo would \nhave had to expressly grant Apotex a license to the '096 application in order to effectively grant \nApotex a license to the '913 patent.   \nIn the end , Horizon points to nothing persuasive  that convince s the Court that in the 2013 \nSettlement Agreement, Nuvo would have had to provide Apotex with a license to the '096 application in order to also be able to convey a license to the '913 patent .  Again, similar to the \nNational Agreement at issue in Intel , here the face of the 2013 Settlement Agreement \ndemonstrates the parties\u2019 intent that the \u201clicense so granted extend not only to the claims then in existence [in the '838 patent] but also to the full scope of any coverage available by way of [continuation] for the invention disclosed.\u201d  I ntel Corp., 703 F.3d at 1367.  And we know from \nIntel that it does not matter that the continuatio n patent issued to Horizon instead of to Nuvo; to \nconclude otherwise would put Apotex in a \u201cposition of being exposed to further risk relating to the exact same inventions that were subject to the license[.]\u201d  Id.\n18 \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that Apotex has an express license to the ' 913 patent  \nthat defeats Horizon\u2019s claim of infringement.  Accordingly, summary judgment in Apotex\u2019s favor is  warranted.   \n \n18  Horizon also posits that Apotex does not have a license to the '913 patent because \nHorizon did not acquire any rights or obligations under 2013 Settlement Agreement from Nuvo, \nand because in the Nuvo- Horizon APA transaction, Nuvo represented that all assets Horizon was \npurchasing, including the '096 application, were free and clear from all encumbrances.  (D.I. 52 \nat 2, 14; Horizon\u2019s Summary Judgment Presentation, Slide 4)   This argument does not win the \nday.  That is  because, as was explained above, a license run s with a patent  and is binding even i f \na later assignee does not know about the license.  Furthermore, if this argument were correct , it \nwould seem to  mean that Horizon would not even need to recognize Apotex\u2019s license to the ' 838 \npatent  itself.  ( See D.I. 64 at 6- 7; see also D.I. 53, ex. B at 6)   But Horizon does concede , of \ncourse,  that Apotex has a license to the '838 patent.  ( See Tr. at 94, 115)    27 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the  Court finds that Defendant s\u2019 Motion should be \nGRANTED.  A n appropriate Order will issue . \n \n "}
