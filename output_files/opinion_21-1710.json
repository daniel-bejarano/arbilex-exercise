A few years ago, Gal-\nderma won a lawsuit against another company, Sun, for infringing the same patents. \nMany of the patents \u2019 terms were construed in that s uit. Galderma now asks me to \nclarify  those constructions. I narrowly clarify one term  but decline to disturb  the rest .  \n2 I. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual  and procedural  background  \nThe drugs at issue treat mainly skin conditions  by administering  doses of doxycy-\ncline. Though doxycycline has long been used for skin treatments, those treatments \ncould be a hassle. Prior administration methods included implants and injections. \nPills were preferable  but had to be taken twice a day: doxycycline is an antibiotic, so \none big dose would risk fungal growth and antibiotic resistance. Yet patients often \nfail to follow a two -a-day schedule.  \nTo address that problem, Galderma developed  one pill that admin isters two doses. It \ndoes so through immediate - and delayed -release portions. For instance, one capsule \ncould contain some amount of the drug that dissolves right away plus another amount  \ncoated in a substance that dissolves slowly. Galderma pa tented its developments.  \nThough Galderma has several patents and dozens of claims on this one drug, the \nfollowing claim is representative:  \n1. An oral pharmaceutical composition of doxycycline, which at a once -daily \ndosage will give steady state blood level s of doxycycline of a minimum of  \n0.1 \u03bcg/ml and a maximum of 1 .0 \u03bcg/ml, the composition consisting of (i) an \nimmediate release (IR) portion comprising 30  mg doxycycline; (ii) a delayed re-\nlease (DR ) portion comprising 10  mg doxycycline; and optionally, (iii) one or \nmore pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.  \nU.S. Patent No.  8,206,740 cl.  1. \nSun already construed the  terms  disputed here : \u201cimmediate release \u201d and \u201cpor-\ntion.\u201d Galderma Lab\u2019y s, L.P.  v. Sun Pharm. Indus. Ltd. , 411 F. Supp. 3d 271 , 281, 297 \n(D. Del . 2019)  (Stark, C.J.) . Both parties agree with the previous constructions. But \nGalderma asks me to clarify them while Lupin asks me to leave them alone.   \n3 B. Legal standard  \n\u201cIt is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the in-\nvention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\u201d Phillips v. AWH Corp. , \n415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nClaim construction is a matter of law. See Teva Pharm s. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. , \n574 U.S. 318, 325 \u201326 (2015). So \u201c[w]hen the parties raise an actual dispute regarding \nthe proper scope of these claims, the court, not the jury, must resolve that dispute.\u201d \nO2 Micro Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co. , 521 F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2008).   \nA court generally gives the words in a claim \u201ctheir ordinary and customary mean-\ning,\u201d which is the \u201cmeaning that [they] would have to a person of ordinary skill in the \nart in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the \npatent application.\u201d Phillips , 415 F.3d  at 1312 \u201313 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Usually, a court fir st considers the claim language, then the remaining intrins ic \nevidence, and then (in limited circumstances ) extrinsic evidence. See Interactive Gift \nExpress, Inc. v. Compuserve Inc. , 256 F.3d 1323, 1331 \u201332 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  \nIntrinsic evidence includes the patent specification, which \u201cis always highly rele-\nvant to t he claim construction analysis and indeed is often the single best guide to \nthe meaning of a disputed term.\u201d AstraZeneca AB v. Mylan Pharms. Inc. , 19 F.4th \n1325, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). So a court must con-\nstrue claims cons istent with the specification while \u201cavoid[ing] the danger of reading \nlimitations from the specification into the claim.\u201d Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1323. Plus, \n\u201c[e]ven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, the claims of the \npatent will not  be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear  \n4 intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or \nrestriction.\u201d Hill-Rom S ervs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp. , 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. \n2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).  \nA court may refer to extrinsic evidence only if it cannot discern the disputed term\u2019s \nordinary and accustomed meaning from the intrinsic evidence. See Vitronics Corp. v. \nConceptronic, Inc. , 90 F. 3d 1576, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Although a court may not use \nextrinsic evidence to contradict  the claim language, extrinsic materials \u201cmay be help-\nful to explain scientific principles, the meaning of technical terms, and terms of art \nthat appear in the pate nt and prosecution history.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc. , 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc),  aff\u2019d, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  \nUltimately, \u201c[t]he construction that stays true to the claim language and most \nnaturally aligns with the patent\u2019s d escription of the invention will be \u2026 the correct \nconstruction.\u201d Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa\u2019 per Azioni , 158 F.3d 1243, 1250 \n(Fed. Cir. 1998).  \nII. CONSTRUING \u201cIMMEDIATE RELEASE \u201d \nBelow are the parties\u2019 proposed constructions  and the construction  I adopt , with \nchanges to Sun in bold :  \nGalderma  Lupin  The Court  \nA dosage form that is \nintended to release \nsubstantially all of \nthe active ingredient \nin vivo  following \noral  administration \nwith no enhanced, de-\nlayed, or extended re-\nlease effect.  A dosage form that \nis intended to re-\nlease substantially \nall of the active in-\ngredient on admin-\nistration, with no \nenhanced, delayed, \nor extended release \neffect.  A dosage form that is inte nded to release \nsubstantially all of the active ingredient \non administration with no enhanced, de-\nlayed, or extended release effect, where \n\u201con\u201d includes immediately after , and \n\u201crelease\u201d is a functional limitation \nreferring  to a release that alter s the \nsubje ct\u2019s steady -state blood level of \ndoxycycline .  \n5 A. Galderma as lexicographer  \nTo start , Lupin says Galderma cannot change  this term\u2019s previous construction.  \nLupin argues that  Sun merely adopted  the patent \u2019s definition , so Galderma was serv-\ning as its \u201cown lexicographer [and it]  must be bound by the express definition .\u201d Si-\nnorgchem Co., Shandong v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n , 511 F.3d 1132, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2007)  \n(internal quotation marks omitted) . (A lexicographer  is one who  defines his patent\u2019s \nterms. See Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1582.)  \nYet, in Sun, \u201c[n]o one argue[d] that [Galderma] was its own lexicographer .\u201d 411 F. \nSupp. 3d at 305 . Instead, the court chose to adopt the specification\u2019s description as its \nconstruction. And I may \u201cclarify [an] initial construction.\u201d Edwards Lifesciences LLC \nv. Cook Inc. , 582 F.3d 1322, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  \nEven if Galderma did act as lexicographer, I can still construe  its definition . I \nsimply read the definition in context and give its  words their ordinary meanings.  Once \nI do so, the definition is still valid so long as it  \u201cadequately divulge [s] a reasonably \nclear  meaning to one of skill in the art .\u201d Hockerson -Halberstadt, Inc. v. Con verse Inc. , \n183 F.3d 1369, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ; cf. K-2 Corp. v. Salomon S.A. , 191 F.3d 1356, \n1365 (Fed. Cir. 1999)  (\u201c[A] dispute over the ordinary and accustomed meaning does not \nimply that such a meaning does not exist.\u201d) . \nSo whether Galderma was its own lexicographer or not, I may construe this dis-\nputed term.   \n6 B. The clarifications  \nFor the term \u201cimmediate release,\u201d Galderma seeks three clarifications. First, it \nwants to add \u201coral .\u201d But the patents in suit uniformly  refer to an \u201coral pharmaceutical \ncomposition.\u201d See, e.g. , \u2019740 Patent cl.  1. So I decline to add this redundancy.  \nSecond, Galderma seeks to change \u201con\u201d to \u201cfollowing.\u201d Though I will not substitute \nthe words, I will clarify that \u201con\u201d does not require insta ntaneousness; it includes \u201c im-\nmediately after .\u201d In construing \u201cdelayed release,\u201d Sun held that the drug is released \n\u201cimmediately  after oral administration \u201d if \u201cabout 75% of active ingredient\u201d is released  \n\u201cwithin 30 minutes of oral administration. \u201d 411 F. Su pp. 3d at 306. And Sun\u2019s con-\nstructions of immediate - and delayed -release portions  (the terms I construe next ) use \n\u201cupon\u201d and \u201cfollowing\u201d interchangeably. See id.  at 309. So I simply state the logical \nimplication : if release is \u201cdelayed\u201d after thirty minutes, it is \u201cimmediate\u201d before then . \nThird, Galderma wants  to add \u201cin vivo .\u201d I agree with Lupin that inserting this \nphrase  would be rash . Though I will clarify \u201crelease ,\u201d I will not change the prior con-\nstruction\u2019s language or use \u201c in vivo .\u201d Instead, I hew closer to the terms in the claim: \n\u201crelease\u201d is a functional limitation referring to a release that alters  the subject\u2019s \nsteady -state blood level of doxycycline.  \nThis clarific ation is narrow. And it should be unsurprising: \u201crelease\u201d of a drug\u2019s \nactive ingredient means releasing that ingredient to have its intended effect , not \nmerely release from a capsule . Achieving specified doxycycline blood levels is \u201cthe \nvery property that gives [the] [p]roduct its clinical effectiveness.\u201d Sun, 411 F. Supp. \n3d at 311. Indeed, this clarification  is reflected in the intrinsic evidence.   \n7 Start with the claim. It says the drug\u2019s goal is  to \u201cgive steady state blood levels of \ndoxycyclin e\u201d within a specified range. \u2019740 Patent cl . 1. It then defines the drug\u2019s com-\nposition with immediate - and delayed -release portions. Bridging the two halves, \u201cre-\nlease\u201d is part of the \u201cpharmaceutical\u201d process in which the patient receives a \u201cdosage\u201d \nto \u201cgiv e steady state blood levels of doxycycline\u201d within the range. Id. The clarification \nhere simply  make s that clear connection explicit . \nThe specification confirms this reading. The first sentence of the \u201cSummary of the \nInvention\u201d provides:  \nThe present invent ion is in its broadest sense directed to pharmaceutical com-\npositions of tetracyclines designed to provide an extended release profile in vivo  \nof levels of active ingredient that at steady state are high enough to be effective \nto have a beneficial effect in  the treatment of a disease or condition, but not as \nhigh as to exert an antibacterial effect. Such pharmaceutical compositions are \nformulated into dosage forms that can be taken once a day.  \n\u2019740 Patent col.  2 ll. 21\u201328 (emphasis added).  \nThe specification refers to this design twice more. See id. col. 3 ll. 45\u201347, col.  5 \nll. 41\u201343. And there are several  other references to the connection between dissolu-\ntion, release, and uptake. See id.  col. 3 ll. 35\u201339 (\u201c[I]t is contemplated that the pres ent \ninvention is applicable to other tetracyclines, particularly other tetracyclines that \nhave similar in vivo absorption profiles as doxycycline \u2026 in the gastrointestinal \ntract.\u201d), col. 4 ll. 13\u201315, col.  7 ll. 47\u201349, col.  8 ll. 9\u201314; cf. Shire Lab\u2019ys , Inc. v. IMPAX \nLab\u2019ys, Inc. , 2005 WL 319983, at *1 (D. Del. Feb. 9, 2005) (construing \u201cimmediate \nrelease upon oral administration\u201d in a similar patent  to mean \u201c the dose of drug is \nreleased and absorbed  without delay after administration \u201d (emphasis added) ).  \n8 Lupin resists any clarification. Its  core concern is that the patent describes only  \nin vitro  testing, so adding  the undefined phrase  \u201cin vivo \u201d would \u201clead to mischief .\u201d \nD.I. 97 at 23:15 \u201317. My construction  sticking to the claim terms  should allay that \nconcern.  Yet Lupin\u2019s  focus on  in vitro  testing is incomplete . True, the drug is  generally  \ntested in a petri dish , not a patient. But that  in vitro  testing is used to model in vivo  \nbehavior.  See D.I. 34 -1 at 605\u201307. The patents reflect this under standing, referring \nto computer models and simulated blood -concentration profiles. \u2019740 Patent col.  3 \nll. 7\u201312, 20 & fig.  4. Indeed, the only time \u201c in vitro \u201d appears in the specification, \u201c in \nvivo\u201d is in the same sentence:  \nThe ratio between the immediate -release portion, or component, and the de-\nlayed -release portion, or component, can be used to adjust the in vitro drug \nrelease profile and in vivo blood concentration profile. By providing such a drug \nrelease profile, the compositions eliminate the need for a second dose for the day.  \nId. col. 5 ll. 31 \u201336. \nThis is not to say that in vitro  testing is insufficient to show how the drug works. \nThat is a question for infringement. As for claim construction, I reach an unsurprising \nconclusion: a term in a drug patent refers to the drug\u2019s effect on the patient.   \n9 III. CONSTRUING \u201cPORTION \u201d \nBelow are the proposed and final constructions, again with changes to Sun in bold :  \n Galderma  Lupin  The Court  \nIR \nPortion  A functional limitation meaning \n\u201cany part of the claimed composi-\ntion that releases drug immedi-\nately upon administration, with \nno enhanced, delayed or ex-\ntended release effect\u201d (i.e., \nwhere \u201cany part\u201d may refer \nto the chemical release, and \ndoes not require p hysically \nor structurally discrete parts \nand includes a combination \nof one or more parts of the \ndosage form as a whole) . A functional limi-\ntation meaning \n\u201cany part of the \nclaimed composi-\ntion that releases \ndrug immediately \nupon administra-\ntion, with no en-\nhance d, delayed or \nextended release \neffect .\u201d A functional limi-\ntation meaning \n\u201cany part of the \nclaimed composi-\ntion that releases \ndrug immediately \nupon administra-\ntion, with no en-\nhanced, delayed or \nextended release \neffect .\u201d \nDR \nPortion  A functional limitation meaning \n\u201cany part of the claimed composi-\ntion that delays release of a drug \nuntil a time other than immedi-\nately following oral administra-\ntion, e.g., through coating, un-\ncoated matrix, or other impedi-\nment to delay release\u201d (i.e., \nwhere  \u201cany part\u201d may refer \nto the chemical release, and \ndoes not require physically \nor structurally discrete parts \nand includes a combination \nof one or more parts of the \ndosage form as a whole) . A functional limi-\ntation meaning \n\u201cany part of the \nclaimed composi-\ntion that delays \nrelease of a drug \nuntil a time other \nthan immediately \nfollowing oral ad-\nministration, e.g., \nthrough coating, \nuncoated matrix, \nor other impedi-\nment to delay re-\nlease .\u201d A functional limi-\ntation meaning \n\u201cany part of the \nclaimed composi-\ntion that delay s \nrelease of a drug \nuntil a time other \nthan immediately \nfollowing oral ad-\nministration, e.g., \nthrough coating, \nuncoated matrix, \nor other impedi-\nment to delay re-\nlease .\u201d \nGalderma next wants to clarify the previous construction of \u201cportion ,\u201d as used in \n\u201cimmedia te release portion\u201d and \u201cdelayed release portion.\u201d In its brief, Galderma  pro-\nposed a three -part clarification of \u201cany part,\u201d wanting to clarify that it (1)  \u201cmay refer \nto the chemical release, \u201d (2) \u201cdoes not require physically or structurally discrete parts ,\u201d \nand (3) \u201cincludes a combination of one or more parts of the dosage form as a whole .\u201d \nD.I. 45 at 35. At the hearing, after (mostly) getting what it wanted in construing  \n10 \u201cimmediate release,\u201d Galderma gave up  on part  (1) and the word \u201cphysically\u201d in \npart (2). D.I. 97 at 31:12 \u201332:24. But it continued to seek the rest of parts  (2) and (3).  \nI will not accept either . There is simply no \u201cactual dispute regarding the proper \nscope of the [] claims.\u201d O2 Micro Int\u2019l Ltd.  521 F.3d at 1360. For part (2), t o say that \n\u201cany part\u201d does not refer to \u201cstructurally discrete parts\u201d is merely to restate Sun\u2019s \nholding. See Sun, 411 F. Supp. 3d at 305  & n.14 (giving \u201cportion\u201d a \u201cfunctional\u201d rather \nthan \u201cstructural meaning ,\u201d and noting  that a structural discrete ness requirement is \n\u201cnowhere in the intrinsic evidence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)) . \nPart (3) has the same issue . I read  Galderma\u2019s less-than -clear  clarification to say  \nthis: even if one \u201cpart\u201d of the pill, \u201cas a whole ,\u201d \u201cincludes a combination\u201d of immediate - \nand delayed -release \u201cdosage form[s],\u201d it is still covered by the term \u201cimmediate [or \ndelayed ] release portion.\u201d That is, even if immediate - and delayed -release portions \nare intermingled, that  combination  is not  a different \u201cportion.\u201d This kind of hybrid \n\u201cportion\u201d was exactly the issue in Sun, where the defendant  purported to have a \u201cmod-\nified release\u201d portion. Id. at 278 \u00b6  33. Sun refused that framing, instead construing \nportion to be functional  and identifying the i mmediate - and delayed -release portions  \nof the  so-called  modified -release portion . Id. at 305 \u201310. Again, I decline to clarify what \nSun already illuminated . \n* * * * * \nGalderma wants me to add several phrases to prior constructions. But in light of \nSun, most  are redundant or would cause confusion. So I slightly clarify just  one of \nSun\u2019s constructions  and leave the rest alone .  \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nGALDERMA LABORATORIES L.P. \nand TCD ROYALTY SUB LP, \n \nPlaintiffs , \n \nv. \n \nLUPIN INC. and LUPIN LTD. , \n \nDefendants . \n No. 21-cv-1710 -SB \n \nORDER  \nFor the reasons given in the accompanying opinion,  I ORDER  that the following \nclaim terms of U.S. Patent Nos.  7,749,532; 8,206,740; 8,394,405; 8,394,406; 8,470,364; \nand 8,709,478 are construed as follows:  \nClaim Term  Court\u2019s Construction  \nimmediate release  / IR \n \n\u2019532 patent , claims  1, 2, 13\u201315, and 20; \n\u2019740 patent , claims  1, 3\u20135, 11, 19, and 22; \n\u2019405 patent , claims  1, 3, 9, 17, and 20; \n\u2019406 patent , claims  1, 3, 8, 17, and 21; \n\u2019364 patent , claims  1, 2, 8, 16, and 17; \nand \u2019478 patent , claims 1 , 5, 20 , and 2 4 A dosage form that is intended to re-\nlease substantially all of the active in-\ngredient on administration with no en-\nhanced, delayed, or extended release ef-\nfect, where \u201con\u201d includes immediately \nafter , and \u201crelease\u201d is a functional limi-\ntation referring to  a release that alters  \nthe subject \u2019s steady -state blood level of \ndoxycycline . \n \n \nDated: April  7, 2023              ____________________________________  \n       UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE  "}
