(D.I. 14). The motion has been fully briefed and I \nhave considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 15, 18, 20). \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs Gone GB Ltd. and Ori Gersht filed a complaint in Delaware Superior Court on \nJune 1, 2021. (D.I. 2 ,r 1). The action was removed to this Court on July 1, 2021, based on the \nassertion that this Court had federal question jurisdiction. (Id. ,r 6). Venue is proper pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a), and this Court has federal question jurisdiction and supplemental jurisdiction \nover this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1367. (Id. at 6-8). \nThis action arises out of a failed collaborative partnership between Plaintiffs and Intel. \nGersht is \"a fine artist\" who works \"principally in photography and film.\" (D.I. 2-1 ,r 9). Gone GB \nis a UK company partly owned by Gersht, \"which is engaged in the business of the creation of \nvisual and audio-visual artworks through its employment of various artisans.\" (Id. ,r 3). Intel is a \ntechnology company and the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world. (Id. ,r,r 4-5). In \n2016, Intel announced its purchase of Replay Technologies, a 3D-imaging company . (Id. ,r,r 26-\n28). Replay developed a technology known as \"freeD,\" \"which is a 3D-imaging process used in \nvolumetric imaging.\" (Id.). \"Volumetric imaging is a technology that captures a three-dimensional \nlocation or a performance. \" (Id. ,r 26). Replay's freeD technology \"utilizes numerous cameras, \narranged in a fashion to capture multiple angles of the subject,\" which \"are stitched together in \nsoftware to create a video that can be manipulated and rotated to display the action from any angle \ncaptured.\" (Id. ,r 28). \n2 Following Intel's acquisition of Replay, Intel established \"Intel Studios,\" \"to create the \nworld's largest volumetric stage in Los Angeles, California with a 10,000 square-foot dome to \ncapture actors and objects in volumetric 3D for production of high-end holographic content for \nVirtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality.\" (Id. 1 31 ). Intel Studios launched operations at the \nbeginning of 2018 with the goal of developing \"immersive media solutions including the capture, \nproduction and distribution oflarge-scale , end-to-end volumetric and Virtual Reality content.\" (Id. \n132). Intel Studios employed \"high speed 8k cameras that could be arranged in an array such that \nthey could capture images moving in real time\" and \"vast computer power required to \nsimultaneously capture footage of images and render that footage into 3D images.\" (Id. 1134-35) . \nIntel Studios \"also employed proprietary software that was required to render the captured data \ninto 3D images.\" (Id. 135). \nIntel Studios \"maintained a unique electronic production environment for the volumetric \nimages created at the Intel Studio (the ['UEPE']) to process the volumetric images taken with the \ncamera array at the studio.\" (Id. 1 41). Intel's UEPE \"consisted of numerous computer servers, \ndata storage devices, and software applications necessary to film, process, and edit the volumetric \nimaging data captured in the studio, as well as the computer servers, data storage devices, and \nsoftware applications necessary for post-production volumetric imaging work .... \" (Id. 142). \nIn 2018, Intel invited Gersht to \"collaborate with Intel Studios on a project ['the Project'] \nto demonstrate the experiential power oflntel's [volumetric imaging] technology .... \" (Id. 146). \nThe goal of the Project was \"to combine [Intel's] industry-leading volumetric video capture and \nprocessing capabilities with Mr. Gersht's creative vision to create the world's first volumetric \nartwork -a museum/gallery installation combining physical structural elements, text, music and a \nVirtual Reality (VR) experience using volumetric footage shot by Mr. Gersht on Intel Studios' \n3 volumetric stage ... \" (Id.). \"The results of the Project were to be co-owned by Mr. Gersht and \nIntel.\" (Id. ,r 47). The Project was initially titled, \"Man on A Wire,\" but, by the time of the \ntermination of the partnership between Plaintiffs and Intel, was titled, \"Letters and Towers.\" (Id. \n,r 49). \nOn April 1, 2019, \"Ori Gersht, through Gone GB LTD\" and Intel entered into anon-binding \nMemorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to \n\"explore a potential collaboration , which may include the creation of a digital audiovisual artistic \nwork (the 'Work'), implementing the Artist's vision with the working title 'Man on a Wire' \nthrough Intel Studios' technology and capabilities .... \" (D.I. 2-2 Ex.Bat 1-3). \nOn June 1, 2019, Gone GB1 and Intel entered into a \"co-production agreement \" (the \n\"CPA\"), which superseded the MOU and governed the terms of their partnership. (D.I. 2-1 ,r 97). \nThe CPA was signed \"by Intel Services Division, LLC and Mr. Gersht's company , Gone GB.\" \n(Id.). Under Section 2.1 of the CPA, the parties agreed to \"co-develop, co-produce, distribute , and \nexploit one or more Works as described in the relevant SOW [statement of work] and in accordance \nwith the terms and conditions of this Agreement. \" (D.I. 2-1 Ex. D at 4). The CPA established, \n\"Artist intends to provide all creative direction for the Work,\" and \"Intel will be responsible for \nvolumetric photography for the Work.\" (Id.). The CPA also provided, \"Intel will provide its \nvolumetric studio facilities and its personnel for use during scheduled volumetric photography , \nincluding without limitation the Technolog y necessary for capture, processing , and storage of \nvolumetric content during the term of the SOW,\" but \"Artist will not have access to cameras, \nGersht signed the CPA on behalf of the \"Artist,\" Gone GB. (D.I. 2-1 Ex. D at 15). The \nCPA states in Section 2.2, \"Artist acknowledges and agrees that all participation in this \nAgreement[] will be by Ori Gersht personally on behalf of Gone GB LTD.\" (Id. at 4). \n4 workstations , servers, network and networking equipment , or any other Intel Technology used for \nphotography.\" (Id.). Section 13 .2 of the CPA provides: \n(Id. at 12). Complete Agreement. This Agreement and any amendments contain the \ncomplete and exclusive agreement and understanding between the Parties \nconcerning the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersede all prior and \ncontemporaneous agreements , understandings , representations , warranties , \nand communications , oral or written, between the Parties relating to the \nsame subject matter. Each Party agrees that in entering into this Agreement \nit has not relied on, and will not be entitled to rely on, any oral or written \nunderstandings , representations , warranties , or communications that are not \nexpressly set forth in this Agreement. The express provisions of this \nAgreement will prevail over any different, conflicting, or additional \nprovisions on any purchase order, acknowledgment , invoice, or other \nwriting issued by either Party. If the provisions of this Agreement conflict \nwith the provisions of any SOW, the conflict will be resolved in favor of \nthe Agreement unless the SOW specifically identifies the conflicting \nprovision of the Agreement. \" \nFrom November 18-20, 2019, Gersht, \"with the participation of approximately sixty \npeople, including seven performers\" completed \"the main shoot at the Intel Studios,\" which \"was \nto be the shoot from which all the volumetric imaging data for the Project was to be obtained.\" \n(D.I. 2-1 ,r,r 103-04). \"Gersht and his artistic collaborators spent over five months preparing for \nthe full shoot, followed by seven days in Los Angeles for the shoot.\" (Id. ,r 103). \nAfter the November 2019 shoot, Gersht \"returned to London to begin work on producing \nthe VR experience.\" (Id. ,r 108). \"Despite Mr. Gersht's numerous requests for access to the \nnecessary software to allow him to work with the volumetric imaging data shot at the Studio in a \nVR software application , and Intel's obligations to deliver that access under both the MOU and \nthe CPA, Intel failed to deliver this software .... \" (Id. ,r 109). \nOn September 23, 2020, Intel informed Gersht via letter \"that Intel was shutting Intel \nStudios and terminating Gone GB' s agreement with Intel.\" (Id. ,r 119). \"In the letter, Intel failed \nto inform Mr. Gersht that the studio had already been shut down and all of the necessary computers \n5 storing the VOLA [volumetric human figures] software had already been dismantled and the \nsoftware engineers had already been terminated or reassigned. \" (Id. ,r 119). \"Intel then informed \nMr. Gersht that Mr. Gersht needed to provide Intel with sufficient computer storage devices to \ntransfer the over 1,000 Terabytes of data including raw footage and a small amount of initial \nvolumetric work that had been completed before Intel stopped work.\" (Id. ,r 120). \nGersht \"determined that it would cost him approximately $70,000 to secure sufficient hard \ndrives to transfer the raw data\" and ultimately \"did not spend the $70,000 necessary to transfer the \nraw data.\" (Id. ,r,r 123-24). Gersht \"does not know what Intel has done with the raw data or whether \nthere is a working version of the VOLA software available. \" (Id. ,r 125). As a result, Gersht \"was \nrendered incapable of making any use of the efforts he expended on the Project over the prior two \nyears.\" (Id. ,r 133). \"The raw data files Intel has offered Mr. Gersht have absolutely no value to \nhim on their own and will not enable Mr. Gersht to complete [the Project],\" because the \"files must \nfirst be rendered into high definition VOLA inserts which were then supposed to be processed \nusing Intel's proprietary plug-ins supported by the team which developed Intel's technology ,\" and, \n\"[w]ithout the [UEPE] and the Intel technical team at his disposal to run the environment , Mr. \nGersht cannot complete the VR Project.\" (Id. ,r 136). \nPlaintiffs bring ten counts against Intel arising out of the failed partnership. In Counts I and \nII, Plaintiffs allege Intel violated Sections 1030(a)(5)(A) and 1030(a)(5)(C ), respectively , of the \nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CF AA\"). (Id. ,r,r 143-49). In Count III, Plaintiffs allege Intel \nviolated Section 935(2) of the analogous Delaware Misuse of Computer Information Act \n(\"MCIA\"). (Id. ,r,r 150-55). In Count IV, Plaintiffs bring a claim of Estoppel and Promissory \nEstoppel based on \"representations and promises\" Intel made to Plaintiffs \"upon which Plaintiffs \nrelied to their extreme detriment. \" (Id. ,r,r 156-59). In Count V, Plaintiffs bring a claim for breach \n6 of contract. (Id. ifif160-66). Counts VI-X are for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and \nfair dealing, tortious interference with contract and prospective business relations, quantum meruit, \nconversion, and \"restitution ,\" respectively . \nIntel seeks dismissal of all claims except Count V, breach of contract, for failure to state a \nclaim. (D.I. 15 at 2-3). \nI only consider the federal claims, as the parties appear to agree that there is otherwise no \nfederal question jurisdiction and impliedly no good reason to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. \n(See D.I. 18 at 8 n.2 (Plaintiffs); D.I. 20 at 1 (Intel); D.I. 24 at 1 (Intel)). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nthe Court must accept the complaint 's factual allegations as true. See Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, \nbut they must provide more than labels, conclusions , or a \"formulaic recitation \" of the claim \nelements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in \nfact).\"). Moreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to \nrelief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied \nwhen the complaint's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\" ( cleaned up)). \n7 III. DISCUSSION \nIn Counts I and II, Plaintiffs bring claims under Sections 1030(a)(5)(A) and (C) of the \nCFAA. \nSection 1030(a)(5)(A) of the CF AA establishes liability against anyone who \"knowingly \ncauses the transmission of a program, information , code, or command, and as a result of such \nconduct, intentionally causes damage without authorization , to a protected computer.\" 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A). The CFAA defines a \"protected computer\" as \"a computer ... which is used in \nor affecting interstate commerce or communication .... \" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(e)(2)(B). The CFAA \ndefines \"damage\" as \"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, \nor information.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(e)(8). Plaintiffs claim Intel's computers are \"protected \ncomputers\" within the meaning of the CF AA and that Intel violated this provision \"[b ]y \ndecommissioning, destroying, and by issuing commands resulting in the [UEPE] being dismantled \nand thereby rendering impossible the ability of Plaintiffs to retrieve the images and the VOLA files \nwithin the [UEPE] on the protected computers .... \" (D.I. 2-1 1145). \nSection 1030(a)(5)(C) establishes liability against anyone who \"intentionally accesses a \nprotected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, causes damage and \nloss.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(C). Plaintiffs claim Intel violated this provision when it \n\"intentionally accessed a protected computer and issued commands within the [UEPE], in a \nmanner that breached its obligations to Plaintiffs by destroying files or rendering other files useless \n.... \" (D.I. 2-11148) . \nThe CF AA does not define \"authorization\" or \"without authorization.\" \nIntel argues that Plaintiffs ' claims fail as a matter of law because (1) Plaintiffs \"cannot \nplausibly allege that Intel's actions discontinuing development of the Work with respect to its own \n8 computer servers, data storage devices, and software was 'without authorization' under the \nCF AA,\" and (2) Plaintiffs ' claim under Section 1030(a)(5)(A) fails because Intel did not cause \n\"damage\" to a protected computer , as \"Intel has not destroyed the data files it created to develop \nthe Work.\" (D.I. 15 at 8). \nPlaintiffs respond, \"\u00a71030(a)(5)(A) does not prohibit one from accessing a computer \n'without authorization; ' rather, it prohibits the intentional causing of damage without \nauthorization,\" and, \"While Intel had authorization to access its own computers, it did not have the \nright to damage the Gone GB co-owned data.\" (D.I. 18 at 4-5). \nI agree with Intel that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the CF AA. It is clear \nfrom the face of the CPA that Intel did not act \"without authorization \" within the meaning of the \nCF AA when it \"decommission[ ed] the computer servers, software, and storage capabilities \nnecessary for completion of the Crucial VR Deliverables\" and \"stopped supporting its VOLA \nsoftware, leaving only a 'read' version of the software available and no functioning machine that \ncan run the process.\" (D.I. 2-1 ,r,r 116-17). \nThe CPA represents \"the complete and exclusive agreement understanding between the \nParties,\" and \"supersede[ s] all prior and contemporaneous agreements , understandings , \nrepresentations, warranties , and communications , oral or written, between the Parties relating to \nthe same subject matter.\" (Id. Ex. D. at 12). Section 2.4 of the CPA expressly provides, \"Intel is \nnot obligated to provide Artist with decision-making authority over the volumetric photography \nprocess, and Artist will not have access to cameras, workstations , servers, network and networking \nequipment, or any other Intel Technology used for photography,\" and the CPA's SOW states, \"All \ntechnology created and developed by Intel during the course of the Work will be solely owned by \nIntel.\" (Id. at 4, 18). \"Technology\" is defined in section 1.23 of the CPA as, \"all know-how , \n9 information, ideas, inventions, modifications, prototypes, tools, equipment, other tangible \nembodiments, and works of authorship, including without limitation specifications, software \n(including instantiated algorithms), databases, compilations, schematics , documentation, data, and \npresentations .\" (Id. at 3). \nUnder the express terms of the CPA, Intel retained sole ownership and control over the \n\"protected computer ,\" i.e., the UEPE.2 Intel therefore could not, as a matter of law, access the \nUEPE \"without authorization,\" as required by \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(C), nor cause \"damage\" to the UEPE \n\"without authorization,\" as required by \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A). (D.I. 2-1 1 42). The CFAA does not \nempower a plaintiff to bring a claim against a defendant for causing \"damage\" to its own computer; \nsuch an interpretation would be untenable . See QVC, Inc. v. Resultly, LLC, 159 F. Supp.3d 576, \n595 (E.D. Pa. 2016) (holding, in the context of CFAA Section 1030(a)(5)(C), \"those who have \npermission to access a computer for any purpose, such as employees, cannot act 'without \nauthorization ' unless and until their authorization to access the computer is specifically rescinded \nor revoked\"); QVC, Inc. v. Resultly, LLC, 99 F. Supp.3d 525, 536 (E.D. Pa. 2015) (holding \"if a \nplaintiff proceeds under Section 1030(a)(5)(A), it must show that the defendant intended to cause \nharm to plaintiff's computer through its access\") ( emphasis added). \nPlaintiffs' citation to Intel's assurance in Section 2.4 of the CPA, \"Intel will provide its \nvolumetric studio facilities and its personnel for use during scheduled volumetric photography, \nincluding without limitation the Technology necessary for capture, processing , and storage of \nvolumetric content during the term of the SOW,\" suggests that there may be a credible breach of \n2 Plaintiffs define the UEPE in their complaint as the \"numerous computer servers, data \nstorage devices, and software applications necessary to film, process, and edit the volumetric \nimaging data captured in the studio, as well as the computer servers, data storage devices, and \nsoftware applications necessary for post-production volumetric imaging work .... \" (D.I. 2-1 1 \n42). \n10 contract claim but does not save Plaintiffs ' CFAA claims. (Id. Ex. D at 4). Intel's commitment to \ngranting Plaintiffs temporary access to \"its\" UEPE does not change the fact that the UEPE \nbelonged to Intel, not to Plaintiffs . \nFor these reasons, Intel's motion to dismiss the federal claims in Counts I, II, and III for \nfailure to state a claim will be granted. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Defendants ' motion to dismiss (D.I. 14) will be GRANTED. \nThe federal claims in Counts I and II are DISMISS ED with prejudice. \nWith the dismissal of the two federal claims, there are still eight state law claims. The case \nis at its initial stages. There is no reason to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Therefore , I \nexercise my discretion to dismiss the state law claims. See DeAscensio v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 342 \nF.3d 301, 309 (3d Cir. 2003) (\"'It has consistently been recognized that pendent jurisdiction is a \ndoctrine of discretion , not of plaintiffs right,\"' and, \"[ w ]here 'the state issues substantially \npredominate, whether in terms of proof, of the scope of the issues raised, or of the \ncomprehensiveness of the remedy sought, the state claims may be dismissed without prejudice and \nleft for resolution to state tribunals.\"') (citing United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 \n(1966)). \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n11 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nGONE GB LTD. and \nORI GERST, \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nINTEL SERVICES DIVISION, LLC and \nINTEL CORPORATION , \nDefendants.
