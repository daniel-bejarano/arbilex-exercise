Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nDavid Shane Gunier, Esquire, and Kevin P. Polansky, Esquire, Nelson Mullins Riley &\nScarborough LLP, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Phillip Anthony Giordano, Esquire,\nGordon, Fournaris & Mammarella, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendant\nMidland Mortgage, a division of MidFirst Bank.\n\nDelia A. Clark, Esquire, Rawle & Henderson LLP, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for\nDefendant Safeguard Properties Management, LLC.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJuly , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nPlaintiff Catherine Mullane, who proceeds pro se and has been granted leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis, filed this case in the District of Connecticut in July 2017.\n(D.I. 1, 7). It was transferred to this Court on January 4, 2019. (D.I. 67, 68). The\nmatter proceeds on the Second Amended Complaint, filed October 26, 2020. (D.I. 112).\nThe two named Defendants are Safeguard Properties and Midland Mortgage.\nDefendant Safeguard Properties states that it is actually Safeguard Properties\nManagement. | will call it Safeguard. Before the Court are Defendant Safeguard\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss and Defendant Midland Mortgage\u2019s motion for summary judgment\nand motion to strike. (D.I. 128, 132, 141). Briefing is complete.\n\nBACKGROUND AND FACTS PRESENTED BY THE PARTIES\n\nThe Second Amended Complaint contains three counts: trespass, conversion,\nand negligence. All other claims were previously dismissed. (D.1. 108, 124). The claims\nconcern damage caused to a property located in Kent County that Plaintiff owns as a\njoint tenant with Anna M. Stanley who quit-claimed that ownership interest to Plaintiff.\n(D.I. 134 at 2). Stanley is the sole obligor on a promissory note secured by a mortgage\nassigned to Midland Mortgage, a division of MidFirst Bank. (/d. at 1-2). The mortgage\ncontains the following clause:\n\n[Mortgagor, i.e., Anna Stanley] shall not commit or permit waste; and shall\n\nmaintain the property in as good condition as at present, reasonable wear\n\nand tear excepted. Upon any failure so to maintain, Mortgagee, at its\n\noption, may cause reasonable maintenance work to be performed at the\ncost of Mortgagor.\n\n(D.1. 134-11, at 10, 7 4). Midland/MidFirst contracted with Defendant Safeguard to\nprovide services to the property to which Midland/MidFirst was a mortgagee. (D.I. 134\nat 2).\n\nSafeguard inspected the property on January 22, 2016, determining that it was\nvacant and in need of interior repair. (/d. at 3). On March 18, 2016, counsel for Plaintiff\ncontact Midland/MidFirst to inquire about maintenance performed by Safeguard at the\nproperty. (/d.). On March 21, 2016, Plaintiff contacted Safeguard about maintenance at\nthe property, and Safeguard advised Plaintiff to contact Midiand/ MidFirst to verify her\nidentity. (/d.) Safeguard inspected the property a second time on March 24, 2016, and,\nagain, confirmed that it was vacant. (/d.). On May 13, 2016, Plaintiff and/or her\nrepresentative called Midland/MidFirst and requested access to the lockbox. (/d.)\nPlaintiff was given the lockbox code. (/d.). Safeguard inspected the property on\nDecember 21, 2016, and saw no indication that Plaintiff or her representative \u201chad taken\nany steps to remediate the property.\u201d (/d.). On August 18, 2017, Plaintiff and/or her\nrepresentative called Midland/MidFirst and requested an itemization of the repairs\nperformed by Safeguard in 2016. (/d. at 4). Plaintiff was provided a list of \u201cail property\npreservation fees and repairs\u201d made to the property. (/d.). On September 6, 2017,\nPlaintiff called Midland/MidFirst to discuss the property and requested removal of the\nlockbox, and she was provided with the lockbox code. (/d.).\n\nThe record reflects that the original complaint referred to communication with\nSafeguard, but it did not name Safeguard as a defendant. (D.I. 1). On March 6, 2018,\nMidland/MidFirst moved to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to join Safeguard\n\nas an indispensable party, and Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file an amended\n2\ncomplaint, and indicated that she was adding new allegations, but not a new party. (D.I.\n23, 24, 57). The proposed amended complaint nevertheless named Safeguard as a\ndefendant. (D.|. 57-1). Plaintiff then filed the proposed amended complaint without the\nCourt having ruled on her motion. (D.I. 60). | granted the motion to amend on January\n18, 2019, struck the amended complaint filed without permission, and, apparently\noverlooking that the proposed amended complaint (although not in full compliance with\nour Local Rules) was attached to Plaintiff's motion, ordered Plaintiff to submit the\namended complaint for this Court's review on or before February 8, 2019. (D.I. 71). On\nMay 9, 2019, | dismissed the case for failure to prosecute after Plaintiff failed to file the\namended complaint. (D.I. 87). Plaintiff moved to reopen the case in June 2019 (D.I.\n89) and moved for leave to file an amended complaint in October 2019 (D.I. 92). |\ngranted both motions. (D.1. 94). The amended complaint named Safeguard as a\ndefendant. (D.I. 95). Midland/MidFirst filed a motion to dismiss. (D.I. 96). The motion\nto dismiss was granted in part and denied in part, and Plaintiff was given leave to file a\nsecond amended complaint. (D.I. 108, 111).\n\nPlaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint on October 26, 2020, and on\nOctober 30, 2020, this Court entered a service order for service upon Safeguard. (D.I.\n113). Plaintiff was ordered to provide documents for service upon Safeguard within 90\ndays from the date of that Order. (/d.). On February 21, 2021, Safeguard was\ndismissed as a defendant after Plaintiff failed to timely provide the required documents.\n(D.|. 119). Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal order and, on April 5, 2021,\n\nprovided the required service documents. (D.|. 120, 122). | vacated the dismissal order\n\nand reinstated the service order. (D.!. 124). Safeguard executed the waiver of service\non August 4, 2021. (D.I. 125).\nMOTION TO DISMISS\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nprovides that an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original\npleading when the amendment arises out of the \u201cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\u201d\nset out in the original pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). For an amendment that adds\na party to relate back, the plaintiff must also satisfy additional conditions, including\nestablishing that the party to be added, \u201cwithin the period provided by Rule 4(m),\u201d Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C), received \u201csuch notice of the action that [it] will not be prejudiced\nin maintaining a defense on the merits.\u201d Arthur v. Maersk, Inc., 434 F.3d 196, 207 (3d\nCir. 2006).\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). When reviewing a motion to dismiss\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept the factual allegations as true. Bell\nAll. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \u201ca short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d /d. at 545.\nFactual allegations do not have to be detailed, but must provide more than labels,\nconclusions, or a \u201cformulaic recitation\u201d of the claim elements. /d. (\u201cFactual allegations\nmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption\nthat all the allegations in the complaint are true.\u201d).\n\nMoreover, there must be enough factual matter to state a facially plausible claim\nto relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is\n\nsatisfied when the complaint\u2019s factual content \u201callows the court to draw the reasonable\n4\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d /d. (\u201cWhere a\ncomplaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops\nshort of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\nDiscussion. Safeguard moves for dismissal on the grounds that: (1) the Second\nAmended Complaint was not timely served pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) and should\nbe dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5); and (2) notice was not provided to\nSafeguard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C), the claims in the Second Amended\nComplaint raised against Safeguard do not relate back to the original complaint, are\ntherefore time-barred, and should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6). (D.I. 128, 129).\nPlaintiff's opposition states that she \u201copposes each and every paragraph of Defendant's\nmotion to dismiss [and other \u2018legal maneuver[s]\u2019] to obfuscate to escape responsibility\nfor their actions which a reasonable person would find wrong.\u201d (D.I. 139 at 3). She\ndoes not address or dispute the lega! arguments raised in Safeguard\u2019s motion.\n\nThe Court turns first to the relation back/statute of limitations issue as it is case\ndispositive.\n\nThe original complaint was filed on July 20, 2017. (D.I. 1). In Delaware, the\nstatute of limitations for trespass (Count One) is three years, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8106; for\nconversion (Count Two), it is three years, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3106; and for negligence (Count\nThree), it is two years, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8107. The Second Amended Complaint describes\nSafeguard\u2019s alleged wrongful acts as occurring between February 2016 and May 2016.\n(D.]. 112). It is undisputed, and cannot be disputed, that the three-year statute of\n\nlimitations on the trespass and conversion claims expired in May 2019 and the two-year\n5\nstatute of limitations on the negligence claim expired in May 2018. The Second\nAmended Complaint was served on Safeguard on August 3, 2021. (D.1. 129-1 at 2; see\nalso D.1. 125).\n\nRule 15(c) can overcome a statute of limitations problem by treating the claims\nagainst an added defendant as if they were filed on the date of the original complaint\nupon satisfaction of the \u201crelation back\u201d principles. See Urrutia v. Harrisburg Cty. Police\nDep't, 91 F.3d 451, 453 (3d Cir. 1996). \u201c[R]elation back depends on the existence of a\ncommon \u2018core of operative facts\u2019 uniting the original and newly asserted claims.\u201d Mayle\nv. Felix, 545 U.S, 644, 659 (2005). The claims against Safeguard in the Second\nAmended Complaint are dependent upon and arise out of the occurrence set forth in the\noriginal complaint. But, to relate back, Plaintiff must also show that Safeguard received\nnotice of institution of the action within [90] days of the filing of the complaint, and if it\n\u201creceived such notice that it will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the\nmerits.\u201d Urrutia, 91 F.3d at 453.\n\nA review of the court docket leaves no doubt that Safeguard, as the added party,\ndid not receive the required notice.\n\nPlaintiff first named Safeguard as a defendant in the Amended Complaint filed\nwithout leave on November 30, 2018, some 16 months after the filing of the original\ncomplaint. (D.I. 60, 71). Safeguard was not served; it had no notice. Plaintiff was\ngiven leave to file an amended complaint. (D.I. 71). On May 9, 2019, the case was\ndismissed for failure to prosecute after Plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint. (D.I.\n87). Plaintiff moved for, and was granted, reconsideration, and she filed an amended\n\ncomplaint on January 6, 2020, again naming Safeguard as a defendant, and\n6\nMidland/MidFirst moved to dismiss. (D.|. 89, 95, 96). Safeguard had not been served\nwhen Midland/MidFirst filed its motion. The motion to dismiss was granted in part and\ndenied in part, and Plaintiff was given leave to file a second amended complaint which\nshe did on October 26, 2020. (D.I. 108, 112). Based upon Plaintiff's in forma pauperis\nstatus, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) and (e)(2), the Court screened the Second Amended\nComplaint and, on October 30, 2020, entered an order for service upon Safeguard.\n(D.I. 113). When Plaintiff did not provide the required forms within the 90 day time-\nframe as required by the order, | dismissed Safeguard as a defendant on February 12,\n2021. (D.I. 119). Safeguard was not served; it had no notice. Plaintiff moved to vacate\nSafeguard\u2019s dismissal and submitted the required service documents. (D.I. 120, 122).\nThe motion to vacate was granted, Safeguard was reinstated as a defendant, and the\nservice packet was sent to the U.S. Marshals Service on July 19, 2021, some nine\nmonths after the Second Amended Complaint was filed. (D.I. 124). Safeguard filed its\nreturn of waiver of service of summons on August 5, 2021. (D.I. 126). Safeguard\nultimately first received notice of this action over four years after Plaintiff filed the\noriginal complaint and almost three years after Plaintiff first named it as a defendant in\nthe amended complaint. (D.I. 129-1 at 2).\n\nAs Safeguard has shown, and Plaintiff has failed to rebut, Safeguard has been\nprejudiced by the delay. (See id. (stating that the vendors who performed work are no\nlonger active vendors with Safeguard; given the lapse of time, insurance coverage for\nSafeguard as an additional insured under vendors\u2019 policies is no longer available; and it\nhas no way of locating individuals who performed work more than five years ago)). In\n\naddition, as evidenced by the original complaint, Plaintiff was aware of Safeguard\u2019s\n7\n\npotential involvement and, hence, there was no mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s\nidentity. See Fed. R. Civ. 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). Nor do the pleadings indicate that Safeguard\nand Midland/MidFirst are so closely related in their business operations or other\nactivities that the institution of an action against Midland/MidFirst served to provide\nnotice of the litigation to Safeguard. See Garvin v. City of Philadelphia, 354 F.3d 215,\n227 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\nThus, relation back does not apply both because Safeguard did not get notice of\nthe action within the time provided by Rule 4(m) and because the delay was prejudicial.\n\nSafeguard\u2019s motion to dismiss will be granted. The claims were time barred by\nthe time Safeguard became aware that it had been named a defendant by Plaintiff and\nPlaintiff failed to satisfy the relation back requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i).\n\nMOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\nStandards of Law. Rule 56(c) requires the court to \u201cgrant summary judgment if\nthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The moving party bears the burden\nof demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec.\nIndus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86 (1986). A fact in dispute is\nmaterial when it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law\u201d and is\ngenuine \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\nnonmoving party.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \u201cIn\nconsidering a motion for summary judgment, a district court may not make credibility\ndeterminations or engage in any weighing of the evidence; instead, the nonmoving\n\nparty\u2019s evidence \u2018is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his\n8\nfavor.\u201d Marino v. Industrial Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255). A court\u2019s role in deciding a motion for summary judgment\nis not to evaluate the evidence and decide the truth of the matter but rather \u201cto\ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.\n\nWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to\n\nfind for the nonmoving party, there is no \u201cgenuine issue for trial.\u201d. The\n\nmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will\n\nnot defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;\n\nthe requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact. When\n\nopposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly\n\ncontradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a\n\ncourt should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\nScott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) (citations, quotations, and alterations omitted).\n\nDiscussion. Midland/MidFirst moves for summary judgment on the grounds that\nthe trespass, conversion, and negligence claims fail as a matter of law, and Plaintiff has\nfailed to show she suffered any damages. (D.I. 132, 133). Plaintiffs opposition to\nMidland/MidFirst\u2019s motion for summary judgment consists solely of argument and is not\naccompanied by sworn affidavits or signed under penalty of perjury. (D.I. 139). Hence,\nher arguments cannot be relied upon as evidence to defeat Defendant\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment. See Williams v. Borough of West Chester, 891 F.2d 458, 460 (3d\nCir. 1989) (nonmoving party cannot simply assert factually unsupported allegations to\nmeet burden at summary judgment).\n\nPlaintiff cannot prevail on the trespass claim. In Delaware, in order to prove an\nintentional trespass to land a plaintiff must show: (1) that the plaintiff has lawful\n\npossession of the land; (2) that the defendant entered onto the plaintiff's land without\n\nconsent or privilege; and (3) damages. Newark Square, LLC v. Ladutko, 2017 WL\n9\n\n544606, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 10, 2017). Entry onto the property in question must\nbe intentional, but the plaintiff need not prove any wrongful intent. /d. The record\nevidence shows that the property at issue was reported vacant, Midland/MidFirst\nlearned the property was in disrepair and vacant, and, pursuant to the terms of the\nMortgage on the property, Midland/MidFirst exercised its option to cause reasonable\nmaintenance work to be performed. Nor has Plaintiff proven that she suffered damages\nas a result of Midland/MidFirst's entry onto the property. No reasonable jury could find\nin favor of Plaintiff and against Midland/MidFirst and, therefore, the Court will grant\nMidland/ MidFirst\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the trespass claim.\n\nPlaintiff cannot prevail on the conversion issue. \u201cIt is well-settled in Delaware\nthat conversion applies to chattel but not to real property.\u201d Corneil Glasgow, LLC v.\nLaGrange Properties, LLC, 2012 WL 3157124, at *5 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 1, 2012)\n(citations omitted). \u201cChattel is \u2018[mJovable or transferable property; personal property;\nesp., a physical object capable of manual delivery and not the subject matter of real\nproperty.\u201d /d. \u201cReal property is \u2018[Iland and anything growing on, attached to, or erected\non it, excluding anything that may be severed without injury to the land.\u201d /d. For Plaintiff\nto recover under a theory of conversion, she must prove precisely which property\nMidland/MidFirst converted and that her interest in the property was viable at the time of\nthe conversion. See CIT Comme\u2019ns Fin. Corp. v. Level 3 Commce\u2019ns, LLC, 2008 WL\n2586694 (Del. Super. Ct. June 6, 2008).\n\nThe Second Amended Complaint alleges that Midland/MidFirst removed,\ndisposed of, destroyed and/or pilfered the personal property of Plaintiff located in the\n\nproperty, that the personal property was not returned to Plaintiff, and that\n10\nMidland/MidFirst converted the personal property to its own use and benefit to the\nexclusion of Plaintiff. (D.I. 112 at 7). In her opposition Plaintiff argues, without support,\nthat Safeguard hired individuals who damaged and removed property that belonged to\nher. (D.I. 139 at 2). She does not refer to Midland/MidFirst. The record evidence does\nnot support Plaintiff's claim of conversion against Midland/MidFirst and no reasonable\njury could find for her on this issue.\n\nTherefore, the Court will grant Midland/ MidFirst\u2019s motion for summary judgment\non the conversion issue.\n\nPlaintiff cannot prevail on the negligence issue. To succeed on a negligence\nclaim, Plaintiff must establish that: (1) defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care; (2)\ndefendant breached that duty; (3) plaintiff was injured; and (4) defendant\u2019s breach\ncaused the plaintiff's injury. Campbell v. DiSabatino, 947 A.2d 1116, 1117 (Del. 2008).\nIf the Court finds that the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff, the defendant is\nentitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Helm v. 206 Mass. Avenue, LLC, 107\nA.3d 1074, 1078 (Del. 2014).\n\nThe Second Amended Complaint contains numerous allegations of Midland/\nMidFirst\u2019s duty of care to Plaintiff, its negligence, and breach of duty. In her opposition,\nPlaintiff argues that Midland/MidFirst\u2019s act of authorizing Safeguard to break into her\nhome is the proximate cause of what followed. She did not, however, produce a\nscintilla of evidence to support her allegations in her opposition to the motion for\nsummary judgment. Nor does she refute the affidavit, exhibits, and other evidence\nsubmitted by Midland/MidFirst (D.I. 134 (e.g., paragraph 4 of the Mortgage; Plaintiff is\n\nnot a party to the mortgage; evidence that the property was vacant and had been\n11\nvandalized; mold was present upon the first inspection of the property). As with her\nother claims, no reasonable jury could find in favor of Plaintiff and against\nMidland/MidFirst.\n\nThe Court will grant Midland/MidFirst\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the\nnegligence issue and will deny Midland/MidFirst\u2019s motion to strike Plaintiff's opposition\nto its motion for summary judgment.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court (1) will grant Safeguard\u2019s motion to dismiss\n(D.I. 128); (2) will grant Midland/MidFirst\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 132); and\n(3) will deny Midland/MidFirst\u2019s motion to strike (D.I. 141).\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\n12\n"}
