CONCLUSION ............................................................................................. 67 \nVl COLMF.co()LLY \nCHIEF JUDGE \nThese three separately consolidated antitrust actions have been coordinated \nfor discovery and pretrial proceedings pursuant to a stipulated order. D.I. 134 at \n3. 1 The actions arise out of agreements to settle patent litigation over extended\u00ad\nrelease quetiapine fumarate, an anti-psychotic drug sold by Defendants \nAstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP and AstraZeneca LP ( collectively, AstraZeneca) \nunder the brand-name Seroquel XR\u00ae. Two of the consolidated actions are class \nactions brought by pharmaceutical wholesalers (the Direct Purchasers)2 and by \nunion health and welfare funds and municipalities (the End-Payors).3 The third \nconsolidated action consists of three cases filed by pharmaceutical retailers (the \n1 Unless otherwise indicated, citations to docket items refer to filings in Civil \nAction No. 1:20-cv-1076. \n2 J M Smith Corporation d/b/a Smith Drug Company and KPH Healthcare \nServices, Inc. a/k/a Kinney Drugs, Inc. filed the operative Consolidated Amended \nComplaint on behalf of the Direct Purchasers. D .I. 13 5. \n3 The operative complaint in the End-Payors' action is the Second Consolidated \nAmended Complaint filed by Fraternal Order of Police, Miami Lodge 20, \nInsurance Trust Fund; Law Enforcement Health Benefits, Inc.; The Mayor and \nCity Council of Baltimore; Pipe Trades Services MN Welfare Fund; Sergeants \nBenevolent Association Health & Welfare Fund; Welfare Plan of the International \nUnion of Operating Engineers Locals 137, 137A, 137B, 137C, and 137R; and The \nUniformed Firefighters' Association of Greater New York Security Benefit Fund \nand The Retired Firefighters' Security Benefit Fund of the Uniformed Firefighters' \nAssociation. D.I. 136. Retailers).4 All the operative complaints allege that AstraZeneca, Banda \nPharmaceuticals LLC, Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Accord Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \nwere original or successor parties to unlawful noncash \"reverse payment\" \nagreements that settled certain patent lawsuits and delayed and suppressed \ncompetition among sellers of generic versions of Seroquel XR\u00ae. Plaintiffs claim \nthat, as a result of these agreements, they paid directly or indirectly \nsupracompetitive prices for branded and/or generic versions of Seroquel XR\u00ae.5 \nThe operative complaints in the Direct Purchasers' and Retailers' actions \neach allege five counts under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, \n2. See D.I. 135 'if'if 180-87, 197-203 (alleging violations of\u00a7 1 in Counts 1 and 3); \nD.I. 135 'if'if 188-96, 204-11, 212-17 (alleging violations of\u00a7 2 in Counts 2, 4, and \n5);20-1086,D.I. l 'if'if 159-65, 175-80(allegingviolationsof\u00a7 1 in Counts 1 and \n3); 20-1087, D.I. 1 'if'if 161-67, 177-82 (same); 20-1089, D.I. 1 'if'if 158-64, 174-79 \n4 Although the Retailers' actions have been consolidated, the Retailers have not \nfiled a consolidated complaint. There are three operative complaints in the \nRetailers' action: No. 1 :20-cv-1086, D.I. 1, filed by CVS Pharmacy, Inc., Rite Aid \nCorp., and Rite Aid Hdqtrs. Corp.; No. 1 :20-cv-1087, D.I. 1, filed by Walgreen \nCo., The Kroger Co., Albertsons Companies, Inc., and H-E-B, L.P.; and No. 1 :20-\ncv-1089, D.I. 1 filed by Hy-Vee Inc. \n5 To be precise, certain Plaintiffs claim that they are in certain instances the \nassignee of claims based on purchases made by various assignors. See, e.g., 20-\n1087, D.I. 1 'if'if 28-31. The fact that a purchase was made by a Plaintiff or its \nassignor has no bearing on the pending motions and, accordingly, for ease of \ndiscussion, I refer only to Plaintiffs in this Memorandum Opinion. \n2 (same); 20-1086, D.I. 1 ,r,r 166-74, 181-89, 190-95 (alleging violations of\u00a7 2 in \nCounts 2, 4, and 5); 20-1087, D.I. 1 ,r,r 168-76, 183-90, 191-96 (same); 20-1089, \nD.I. 1 ,r,r 165-73, 180-87, 188-93 (same). The operative complaint in the End\u00ad\nPayors' action alleges a series of state law antitrust, consumer protection, and \nunjust enrichment claims. D.I. 136 ,r,r 233-95. \nAll the operative complaints name AstraZeneca, Banda, and Par as \ndefendants; the operative complaints in the Retailers' actions also name Accord as \na defendant in two counts. For ease of reference, I will refer at times to \nAstraZeneca, Banda, Par, and Accord collectively as \"Defendants.\" \nPending before me are (1) AstraZeneca, Banda, and Par's motion to dismiss \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )( 6) the Consolidated Amended \nComplaint filed by the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs, D.I. 137; (2) AstraZeneca, \nBanda, Par, and Accord's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) the three \ncomplaints filed by the Retailer Plaintiffs, D.I. 141; and (3) AstraZeneca, Banda, \nand Par's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(l) and 12(b)(6) the Second \nConsolidated Amended Complaint filed by the End-Payor Plaintiffs, D.I. 139. \n( Accord states in its briefing that it joins the first motion. D .I. 144 at 1. \nAstraZeneca UK Ltd. is named as a movant in all three motions, but it is not a \nnamed defendant in the Direct Purchasers' complaint. D.I. 135 at 1.) \n3 I. BACKGROUND \nA. Legal Framework \nThe antitrust claims in this case arise out of Abbreviated New Drug \nApplication or \"ANDA\" litigation and implicate patent law and the so-called \nHatch-Waxman Act amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(FDCA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq. Judge Sirica helpfully summarized in King Drug \nCompany of Florence v. Smithkline Beecham Corporation, 791 F.3d 388 (3d Cir. \n2015), how patent law intersects with the Hatch-Waxman amendments to create \nANDA litigation: \nA patent ... is an exception to the general rule against \nmonopolies and to the right to access to a free and open \nmarket. The Constitution's Patent Clause itself reflects a \nbalance between the need to encourage innovation and the \navoidance of monopolies which stifle competition without \nany concomitant advance in the \"Progress of Science and \nuseful Arts.\" [U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl.8.] In tum, from \ntheir inception, the federal patent laws have embodied a \ncareful balance between the need to promote innovation \nand the recognition that imitation and refinement through \nimitation are both necessary to invention itself and the \nvery lifeblood of a competitive economy. A patent, \nconsequently, is a special privilege designed to serve the \npublic purpose of promoting the \"Progress of Science and \nuseful Arts.\" [Id.] \nWith the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch\u00ad\nWaxman Act, Congress attempted to balance the goal of \nmaking available more low[-]cost generic drugs with the \nvalue of patent monopolies in incentivizing beneficial \npharmaceutical advancement. The Act seeks to \n4 accomplish this purpose, in part, by encouraging \nmanufacturers of generic drugs to challenge weak or \ninvalid patents on brand name drugs so consumers can \nenjoy lower drug prices. The resulting regulatory \nframework has the following four relevant features \nidentified by the Supreme Court in [Federal Trade \nCommission v.] Actavis, [570 U.S. 136, 140-44 (2013)]. \nFirst, a new drug-that is, a pioneer, \"brand-name\" \ndrug-cannot be introduced until it is approved by the \nFood and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). A New Drug \nApplication (\"NDA\") requires the applicant to submit, \namong other things, full reports of investigations which \nhave been made to show whether or not such drug is safe \nfor use and whether such drug is effective in use, as well \nas comprehensive information about the drug. This \nreporting requirement entails \"a long, comprehensive, and \ncostly testing process.\" [Id. at 142]. \nSecond, the Hatch-Waxman Act facilitates the \ndevelopment of generic drugs by allowing an applicant to \nfile, for new drugs shown to be \"bioequivalent\" to a drug \npreviously approved by the FDA, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(iv), a less onerous and less costly \n\"Abbreviated New Drug Application\" (\"ANDA\") in lieu \nof an NDA. The ANDA process \"allow[s] the generic to \npiggy-back on the pioneer's approval efforts ... , thereby \nfurthering drug competition.\" Actavis, [570 U.S. at 142] \n(citing Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, \n[566 U.S. 399, 405] (2012)). \nThird, Hatch-Waxman \"sets forth special procedures \nfor identifying, and resolving, related patent disputes.\" Id. \n[at 143]. A new drug applicant must list information on \nany patents issued on the drug's composition or methods \nof use. If the FDA approves the new drug, it publishes this \ninformation, without verification, in its Orange Book. In \ntum, any manufacturer filing an ANDA to produce a \ngeneric version of that pioneer drug must consult the \n5 Orange Book and \"assure the FDA that [the] proposed \ngeneric drug will not infringe the brand's patents.\" \n[Caraco, 566 U.S. at 406]. As relevant here, the \nmanufacturer may tender that assurance with a \"paragraph \nIV\" certification that the relevant listed patents are \n\"invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, \nor sale of the [generic] drug.\" 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 355O)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). But filing a paragraph IV \ncertification means provoking litigation, because the \npatent statute treats paragraph IV certification as a per se \nact of infringement, see 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A). The \npatentee then has an incentive to sue within 45 days in \norder to trigger a 30-month stay of the FDA's potential \napproval of the generic \"while the parties litigate patent \nvalidity (or infringement) in court. If the courts decide the \nmatter within that period, the FDA follows that \ndetermination; if they do not, the FDA may go forward and \ngive approval to market the generic product.\" Actavis, \n[570 U.S. at 143] (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355Q)(5)(B)(iii)). \n\"Fourth, Hatch-Waxman provides a special incentive \nfor a generic to be the first to file an Abbreviated New \nDrug Application taking the paragraph IV route.\" [Id.] \nFrom when it first begins marketing its drug or when a \ncourt enters judgment finding the challenged patent \ninvalid or unenforceable, the first-filing generic enjoys a \n180-day period of exclusivity during which no other \ngeneric manufacturer can enter the market. See 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 355O)(5)(B)(iii), (iv). This exclusivity period belongs to \nfirst-filing ANDA applicants alone and is nontransferable. \nSee id. \u00a7 355O)(5)(D); Actavis, [570 U.S. at 143-44]. The \nperiod does not, however, prevent the brand-patentee from \nmarketing its own \"authorized generic.\" \nId. at 394-96 (footnotes, most citations, and most internal quotation marks \nomitted). (An \"authorized generic\"--often referred to as \"AG\"-is simply the \nterm used to describe an approved brand name drug that is marketed without the \n6 brand name on its label. See FDA List of Authorized Generic Drugs, Food & Drug \nAdmin. (Apr. 1, 2022), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/abbreviated-new-drug\u00ad\napplication-anda/fda-list-authorized-generic-drugs.) \nIn Actavis, the Supreme Court held that agreements between first-filer \ngenerics and brand manufacturers to settle ANDA cases may in certain \ncircumstances give rise to antitrust claims. In reaching this conclusion, the Court \nrejected the Eleventh Circuit's so-called \"scope of the patent\" rule that immunized \nsuch agreements \"'from antitrust attack so long as [their] anticompetitive effects \nfall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent.'\" 570 U.S. at 141 \n(quoting FTC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 677 F.3d 1298, 1312 (11th Cir. \n2012)). The Court held specifically inActavis that a settlement agreement \npursuant to which a brand manufacturer pays a first-filer generic manufacturer a \n\"large and unjustified\" sum in exchange for the generic's agreement to relinquish \nits patent invalidity and noninfringement claims and delay its entry into the market \n\"can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.\" 570 U.S. at 141, 158. Such agreements \nare referred to as \"reverse payment\" agreements because they require the patentee \nto pay the alleged infringer, and not the other way around. They raise antitrust \nconcerns because they remove from the market the risk of competition that arises \nfrom expected litigation outcomes. The Court explained in Actavis that an \n7 \"unexplained large reverse payment\" that is inconsistent with traditional settlement \nconsiderations, such as avoided litigation costs, \nwould normally suggest that the patentee has serious \ndoubts about the patent's survival. And that fact, in tum, \nsuggests that the payment's objective is to maintain \nsupracompetitive prices to be shared among the patentee \nand the challenger rather than face what might have been \na competitive market-the very anticompetitive \nconsequence that underlies the claim of antitrust \nunlawfulness. \n570 U.S. at 157. \nIn King Drug, the Third Circuit held that Actavis' s holding is not \"limited to \nreverse payments of cash.\" 791 F.3d at 403. At issue in King Drug was a \"no\u00ad\nAG\" settlement agreement whereby a brand manufacturer agreed to relinquish its \nright to produce an AG drug to compete with a first-filer generic's drug during the \n180 days of first-filer market exclusivity. The Court explained that the 180-day \nexclusivity period was \"possibly worth several hundred million dollars\" and \n\"where the bulk of the first-filer's profits lie.\" Id. at 404 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). It held accordingly that \"no-AG\" agreements can \"fall[] under Actavis's \nrule because [they] may represent an unusual, unexplained reverse transfer of \nconsiderable value from the patentee to the alleged infringer and may therefore \ngive rise to the inference that [ they are] a payment to eliminate the risk of \ncompetition.\" Id. at 394. \n8 B. Facts \nBecause I am assessing the merits of motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b )( 6) \nfor failure to state a claim and a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(l) for lack of \njurisdiction based on an alleged failure to plead facts necessary to support \nconstitutional standing, I accept as true all factual allegations in the operative \ncomplaints and in documents explicitly relied upon in the operative complaints. \nSee Mgmt. Sci. Assocs., Inc. v. Datavant, Inc., 510 F. Supp. 3d 238,244 (D. Del. \n2020) (\"When assessing the merits of a Rule 12(b )( 6) motion to dismiss, a court \nmust accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and in documents \nexplicitly relied upon in the complaint, and it must view those facts in the light \nmost favorable to the plaintiff.\"); In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data \nBreach Litig., 846 F.3d 625, 633 (3d Cir. 2017) (holding that courts should apply \nRule 12(b )( 6) standard of review to \"facial\" challenges under Rule 12(b )( 1) that \nthe pleaded facts did not establish constitutional standing). The following \nbackground information is based on those allegations. 6 \nAstraZeneca makes and sells brand and AG versions of Seroquel XR\u00ae. \nBefore generic versions of Seroquel XR\u00ae were made available on the market, \n6 The allegations in the five operative complaints are largely the same and, \ntherefore, following the parties' lead, I refer only to the Direct Purchasers' \noperative complaint unless a difference of significance among the complaints \nexists. \n9 AstraZeneca's annual sales of brand Seroquel XR\u00ae in the United States excef;!ded \n$1 billion. D.I. 135 ,T 2. AstraZeneca listed U.S. Patent No. 5,948,437 (the #437 \npatent) in the Orange Book for Seroquel XR\u00ae. The #437 patent's expiration date \nwas May 28, 2017. D.I. 135 ,T 5. \nIn 2008, Randa filed with the FDA the first ANDA for approval to sell \ngeneric Seroquel XR\u00ae in four dosages: 50 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg. D.I. \n135 ,T 3. Randa also filed an ANDA for a 400 mg dosage of Seroquel XR\u00ae in \n2008, but Accord had filed earlier in the year the first ANDA for that dosage. D.I. \n135 ,T 3. At least four other manufacturers filed ANDAs for at least one dosage,' \nand at least one of those ANDAs covered all five dosages. AstraZeneca Pharms. \nLP v. Anchen Pharms., Inc., 2012 WL 1065458, at *5, *8 (D.N.J. Mar. 29, 2012), \najf'd, 498 F. App'x 999 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \nBoth Randa and Accord filed paragraph IV certifications asserting that the \n#43 7 patent was invalid, unenforceable, or would not be infringed by their \nrespective generic products. D.I. 135 ,T,T 3-4. In response, AstraZeneca filed \npatent infringement suits against Randa and Accord in 2008 and 2009. D.I. 135 ,T,T \n7-10. \nOver the course of AstraZeneca's litigation with Randa, based in part on the \ncourt's claim construction rulings, \"it became clear that Randa's proposed generic \nversion[s] of Seroquel XR[\u00ae] would not infringe the [#]437 [p]atent.\" D.I. 135 ,T \n10 11. Almost two years into the litigation, in December 2010, the FDA granted \ntentative approval of Randa's ANDA, having \"determin[ed] that Randa's ANDA \nfor generic Seroquel XR[\u00ae] was approvable and satisfied all bioequivalence; \nchemistry, manufacturing, and controls ('CMC'); and labeling requirements.\" D.I. \n135 113. The FDA was unable to give final approval of Randa's ANDA because \nof the 30-month stay that was triggered when AstraZeneca sued Banda for \ninfringement. D.I. 135113. \nIn September 2011, \"[r]ather than face the risk that Randa's proposed \ngeneric versions of Seroquel XR[\u00ae] would be found not to infringe the [#]437 \n[p]atent, AstraZeneca [decided to] induce[] Banda with a large 'reverse payment' \n(i.e., a payment from the patent holder, AstraZeneca, to the alleged infringer, \nBanda), to quit the patent fight and not compete with AstraZeneca for up to five \nyears.\" D.I.135114. The reverse payment came in the form of (1) a promise by \nAstraZeneca not to sell its 50 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg AG versions of \nSeroquel XR\u00ae during Randa's 180-day first-filer exclusivity period (i.e., from \nNovember 1, 2016 through April 30, 2017) and (2) the right to buy generic product \nfrom AstraZeneca to sell as Randa's own product during its first-filer exclusivity \nperiod. D.I. 135115; D.I. 136115.7 The Direct Purchasers and the End-Payors \n7 The Retailers do not allege Randa's right to buy generic product from \nAstraZeneca. 20-1086, D.I. 1115; 20-1087, D.I. 1115; 20-1089, D.I. 1115. \n11 allege that AstraZeneca's \"no-AG\" promise to Banda was worth more than $233 \nmillion-i.e., the difference, according to Plaintiffs, between what Banda would \nreasonably have expected to earn as the only generic seller on the market for the \n180 days after November 1, 2016 and what it would reasonably have expected to \nearn if it faced competition from an AG during that period. D.I. 135 ,r,r 21, 139. \nThe Retailers allege the no-AG promise was worth more than $163 million. 20-\n1086, D.I. 1 ,r 114; 20-1087, D.I. 1 ,r 116; 20-1089, D.I. 1 ,r 113. In exchange for \nthe \"reverse payment\" and the right to buy AG from AstraZeneca to sell as its own \ngeneric, Banda agreed to \"quit\" its patent fight and delay the launch of its generic \nSeroquel XR\u00ae products until November 1, 2016. \nThe purpose and effect of the Handal AstraZeneca settlement agreement was \nto (1) delay until November 1, 2016 the availability of generic Seroquel XR\u00ae in \nthe four Banda first-filer dosages, (2) allocate to AstraZeneca through November \n1, 2016 100% of the U.S. sales of Seroquel XR\u00ae in those dosages, (3) delay the \nentry of AstraZeneca's AG for those dosages until May 1, 2017 and thereby \nallocate to Banda 100% of U.S. sales of generic Seroquel XR\u00ae between November \n1, 2016 and May 1, 2017, and (4) enable AstraZeneca and Banda to sell at \nsupracompetitive prices, respectively, brand and generic Seroquel XR\u00ae in the four \nHanda first-filer dosages. D.I. 135 ,r,r 123, 182. \n12 In 2012, Par acquired Randa's ANDA and an assignment of the \nHandal AstraZeneca settlement agreement. Under the terms of that acquisition, Par \nand Banda share any profits obtained from sales of generic Seroquel XR\u00ae \nproducts made pursuant to the settlement agreement. D.I. 135 ~ 17-18. \nAstraZeneca reached a similar agreement with Accord. Like Banda, Accord \nreceived tentative approval of its ANDA from the FDA in December 2010. D.I. \n135 ~ 126. But unlike Banda, Accord conceded in its litigation with AstraZeneca \nthat its product infringed the #437 patent. See D.I. 144-2 ~ 77 (incorporated by \nreference in the Direct Purchasers' operative complaint, D.I. 135 ~~4-10, nn.5-\n10). In October 2011, Accord executed a settlement agreement with AstraZeneca \npursuant to which Accord agreed to \"quit\" its \"patent fight\" with AstraZeneca and \ndelay its launch of generic 400 mg Seroquel XR\u00ae tablets until November 1, 2016. \nD.I. 135 ~ 19. For its part, AstraZeneca agreed not to sell AG 400 mg tablets until \nafter Accord's 180-day first-filer exclusivity period ended on April 30, 2017. D.I. \n135 ~ 19. The Direct Purchasers and the End-Payors allege that the \"no-AG\" \npromise was worth more than $107 million to Accord. D.I. 135 ~ 140; D.I. 136 ~ \n175. The Retailers allege it was worth more than $75 million. 20-1086, D.I. 1 ~ \n115; 20-1087, D.I. 1 ~ 117; 20-1089, D.I. 1 ~ 114. \nPlaintiffs allege that the purpose and effect of the Accord/ AstraZeneca \nsettlement agreement was to (1) delay until November 1, 2016 the availability of \n13 generic 400 mg Seroquel XR\u00ae, (2) allocate to AstraZeneca through November 1, \n2016 100% of the U.S. sales of 400 mg Seroquel XR\u00ae, (3) delay the entry of \nAstraZeneca's 400 mg AG until May 1, 2017 and thereby allocate to Accord 100% \nof U.S. sales of 400 mg generic Seroquel XR\u00ae between November 1, 2016 and \nMay 1, 2017, and ( 4) enable AstraZeneca and Accord to sell at supracompetitive \nprices, respectively, brand and generic 400 mg Seroquel XR\u00ae. D.I. 135, 199. \nOn November 1, 2016, Par began selling 50 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 \nmg generic Seroquel XR\u00ae and Accord began selling 400 mg generic Seroquel \nXR\u00ae. D.I. 135 ,, 19, 21. AstraZeneca launched AG versions of Seroquel XR\u00ae in \n50 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg dosages on May 1, 2017. D.I. 135, \n22. Also in May 2017, other competitors launched their own generic versions of \nSeroquel XR\u00ae in all dosage strengths. D.I. 135, 23. \nHad Randa/Par and Accord not entered into their settlement agreements with \nAstraZeneca, they would have obtained final FDA approval for and sold their \nrespective dosages of generic Seroquel XR\u00ae before November 1, 2016. D.I. 135 \n, 128. Thus, but for the settlement agreements, AstraZeneca's brand Seroquel \nXR\u00ae would have faced competition from generics before November 1, 2016 and \nthe price of brand Seroquel XR\u00ae would have been lower. \nAlso, but for those agreements, AstraZeneca would have sold AG versions \nof Seroquel XR\u00ae contemporaneously with the market entry by Randa/Par and \n14 Accord instead of after Banda/Par's and Accord's 180-day exclusivity periods. \nD.I. 135 il 144. Thus, but for the settlement agreements, there would have been \ncompetition in the market between generic versions of Seroquel XR\u00ae and the price \nof generic Seroquel XR\u00ae would have been lower. \nBeginning on August 2, 2015, the Direct Purchasers and the Retailers \npurchased branded Seroquel XR\u00ae from AstraZeneca and generic Seroquel XR\u00ae \nfrom Par or Accord at supracompetitive prices. D.I. 135 il 35-36; 20-1086, D.I. 1 il \n27-29; 20-1087, D.I. 1 il 27-31; 20-1089, D.I. 1 il 27-28.8 Beginning on \nSeptember 5, 2013, the End-Payors, who operate employee and retiree health \nbenefits plans, \"indirectly purchased, paid and/or [provided reimbursement or \nreimbursed] for some or all of the purchase price of brand or generic Seroquel \nXR[\u00ae]\" at supracompetitive prices. D.I. 136 ilil 32-38, 166, 223. The End-Payors \nbring their claims on behalf of a class of \"persons and entities\" located in 3 5 states \n8 The Direct Purchasers define their Class Period as being from August 2, 2015 \n\"until the effects of Defendants' conduct ceases.\" D.I. 135 il 43. The Retailers \nallege that they are \"absent class members\" of the Direct Purchasers' putative class \n\"[b]y virtue of their assignments [from various drug wholesalers],\" and they base \ntheir claims on purchases they made during the same time span covered by the \nDirect Purchasers' Class Period. See 20-1086, D.I. 1 il 129; 20-1087, D.I. 1 il 131; \n20-1089, D.I. 1 il 128. The End-Payors allege that their Class Period started on \nSeptember 5, 2013 and continues \"until the anticompetitive effects of Defendants' \nchallenged conduct cease.\" D.I. 136 il 223. The starting dates of the Class Periods \nhave no bearing on the resolution of the pending motions. \n15 and the District of Columbia who, similarly, indirectly purchased or reimbursed the \npurchase of brand or generic Seroquel XR\u00ae.

Rule 12(b )( 6) \n\"A district court may grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b )( 6) if, accepting all well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable \nto the plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Ballentine v. United States, 486 \nF.3d 806, 810 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To \nstate a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the complaint \nmust include more than mere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of \nthe elements of a cause of action.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 \n(2007) ( citation omitted). The complaint must set forth enough facts, accepted as \ntrue, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Id. at 570. A claim is \nfacially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ( citation omitted).

Lujan v. Deft. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 561 (1992). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nDefendants argue that dismissal of the Direct Purchasers' operative \ncomplaint is required for two reasons: First, the antitrust claims alleged in the \ncomplaint are barred by the statute of limitations set forth in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b; and \nsecond, Plaintiffs have failed to plead an antitrust injury. D.I. 138 at 2-3. \nDefendants contend that the Retailers' operative complaints should be dismissed \n17 \"for the same reasons set forth in Defendants' motion to dismiss [ the Direct \nPurchasers'] claims.\" D.I. 142 at 2. \nDefendants argue that the End-Payors' claims \"suffer from myriad and \nsubstantive deficiencies\" that include alleged failures to satisfy state-specific \npleading requirements. D.I. 140 at 2-3. Although the End-Payors have not alleged \nfederal antitrust claims, Defendants argue that the End-Pay ors' state law claims \n\"amount[] to 'a Frankensteinian equivalent' of federal antitrust law\" and that the \nstate law claims therefore \"should be dismissed for the same reasons that the \n[Direct Purchasers'] claims should be dismissed.\" D.I. 140 at 1-2. Defendants \nargue, and the End-Payors do not dispute, that \"[i]f [I] conclude[] that the [Direct \nPurchasers'] [federal antitrust] claims should be dismissed, the [End-Payors'] \nclaims should also be dismissed, and there is no need to reach the remaining state \nlaw-specific issues.\" D.I. 140 at 2. For that reason, I begin my analysis by \nconsidering Defendants' arguments with respect to the adequacy of the Direct \nPurchasers' federal antitrust claims. \nA. The Direct Purchasers' Federal Antitrust Claims \n1. Whether the Direct Purchasers' Claims are Barred by \u00a7 15b \nThe parties agree that under \u00a7 15b the statute of limitations for federal \nantitrust claims is four years. They also agree that the claims alleged in the Direct \nPurchasers' operative complaint were first brought when Smith Drug Company \n18 filed the first complaint in the Direct Purchasers' action-that is, August 2, 2019. \nD.I. 138 at 4; D.I. 147 at 4; D.I. 148 at 2.9 And finally, they agree that the Direct \nPurchasers' antitrust claims that accrued more than four years before that date are \nbarred by the statute of limitations. D.I. 138 at 4; D.I. 147 at 4; D.I. 148 at 2. The \nparties dispute, however, when the Direct Purchasers' claims accrued. \nDefendants argue that the claims accrued when the settlement agreements \nwere executed and publicly announced in October 2011. D.I. 138 at 4. Plaintiffs \nargue, and I agree, that under Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research., Inc., 401 \nU.S. 321 (1971), the claims accrued when Defendants sold the Direct Purchasers \nSeroquel XR\u00ae at supracompetitive prices. D.I. 148 at 4-5.10 \nIn Zenith, the Court held: \nThe basic rule is that damages are recoverable under the \nfederal antitrust acts only if suit therefor is 'commenced \nwithin four years after the cause of action accrued,' 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 15b, plus any additional number of years during \n9 The Retailers state in their brief that Smith Drug filed its complaint on August 3, \n2019. D.I. 147 at 4. The complaint, however, was filed on August 2, 2019. See \nD.I. 1 at 67. \n10 The Retailers had alleged in their operative complaints that Defendants \nfraudulently concealed the Handal AstraZeneca and Accord/ AstraZeneca \nagreements and that this concealment should permit Plaintiffs to recover for the \nsupracompetitve purchases of Seroquel XR\u00ae they made before August 2, 2015. \n20-1086, D.I. 1 ,r 130; 20-1087, D.I. 1 ,r 132; 20-1089, D.I. 1 ,r 129. The Retailers, \nhowever, have withdrawn their fraudulent concealment allegations, see D.I. 147 at \n4, and therefore I do not address Defendants' arguments regarding fraudulent \nconcealment. \n19 which the statute of limitations was tolled. Generally, a \ncause of action accrues and the statute begins to run \nwhen a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiffs \nbusiness. This much is plain from the treble-damage \nstatute itself. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15. In the context of a \ncontinuing conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws, ... \nthis has usually been understood to mean that each time \na plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants a cause \nof action accrues to him to recover the damages caused \nby that act and that, as to those damages, the statute of \nlimitations runs from the commission of the act. \n401 U.S. at 338-39 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Applying this basic rule \nto the continuing antitrust conspiracies alleged in the operative complaint, each \ntime Defendants sold Seroquel XR\u00ae at a supracompetitive price to a Direct \nPurchaser, Defendants committed an overt act that injured that Direct Purchaser \nand triggered a new limitations period. Accordingly, since August 2, 2015 is the \nbeginning of both the Class Period and the limitations period, each sale of \nsupracompetitive-priced Seroquel XR\u00ae by Defendants during the Class Period \ngives rise to a timely federal antitrust claim. \nDefendants insist that their sales of Seroquel XR\u00ae during the limitations \nperiod were \"by no stretch ... new overt acts,\" D.I. 138 at 9 (emphasis in the \noriginal), but instead were simply \"a manifestation of the prior overt act of entering \ninto [the settlement agreements],\" D.I. 138 at 10 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). According to Defendants, \"[l]ater performance ( or \n20 consequences) of allegedly anticompetitive contracts does not keep the limitations \nperiod running.\" D.I. 138 at 10 (footnote omitted). \nCourts have held that performance of an anticompetitive contract does not \nrestart the limitations period. See, e.g., US Airways, Inc. v. Sabre Holdings Corp., \n938 F.3d 43, 68-69 (2d Cir. 2019); Varner v. Peterson Farms, 371 F.3d 1011, \n1019-20 (8th Cir. 2004). But Defendants' sales to the Direct Purchasers did not \nconstitute performance of the settlement agreements. The Direct Purchasers were \nnot parties to the agreements. Nor were they third-party beneficiaries of the \nagreements; on the contrary, they are alleged victims of the agreements. The \nagreements gave the Direct Purchasers no right to purchase Seroquel XR\u00ae, nor did \nthey obligate Defendants to sell Seroquel XR\u00ae to the Direct Purchasers. Thus, \nDefendants' sales to the Direct Purchasers at supracompetitive prices were \nindependent acts that caused the Direct Purchasers' injuries and started new \nlimitations periods. \nCourts have also held that consequences that necessarily flow from an \nanticompetitive agreement do not restart the limitations period. See, e.g., DXS, Inc. \nv. Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., 100 F.3d 462, 467-68 (6th Cir. 1996) (\"[A]cts \nthat are merely 'unabated inertial consequences' ... do not restart the statute of \nlimitations.\"); Poster Exch., Inc. v. Nat'! Screen Serv. Corp., 517 F.2d 117, 128 \n(5th Cir. 1975) (\"[A] newly accruing claim for [antitrust] damages must be based \n21 on some injurious act actually occurring during the limitations period, not merely \nthe abatable but unabated inertial consequences of some pre-limitations action.\"). \nBut since the agreements here did not require the Direct Purchasers to buy or \nDefendants to sell Seroquel XR\u00ae, Defendants' sales of Seroquel XR\u00ae to the \nDirect Purchasers after August 2, 2015, D.I. 135143, did not necessarily flow \nfrom ( and were not the \"unabated inertial consequences of') the agreements. \nDefendants are correct that, under the operative complaint's theories of liability, \nthe agreements were necessary for the sales to occur-that is, they were \"but for\" \ncauses of the sales; but the agreements alone were not sufficient to bring about the \nsales. For the sales to take place, Defendants had to engage in separate overt acts \nindependent of their obligations under the agreements. At a minimum, Defendants \nhad to negotiate and agree on the terms of the sales and then carry them out. \nConfirmation that under Zenith's basic rule Defendants' sales of Seroquel \nXR\u00ae to the Direct Purchasers constituted overt acts that restarted the limitations \nperiod comes from Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., 521 U.S. 179 (1997). Citing Zenith \namong other authorities, the Supreme Court stated in Klehr that \n[a]ntitrust law provides that, in the case of a \"continuing \nviolation,\" say, a price-fixing conspiracy that brings \nabout a series of unlawfully high priced sales over a \nperiod of years, \"each overt act that is part of the \nviolation and that injures the plaintiff,\" e.g., each sale to \nthe plaintiff, \"starts the statutory period running again, \n22 regardless of the plaintiff's knowledge of the alleged \nillegality at much earlier times.\" \n521 U.S. at 189 (citations omitted). \nDefendants argue that this statement from Klehr \"has no bearing here \nbecause Plaintiffs do not allege price-fixing.\" D.I. 154 at 4. But Plaintiffs do \nallege price fixing. See D.I. 135 ilil 182 (\"The purpose and effect of the Randa \nNon-Compete Agreement was to: ... fix and maintain, at supracompetitive levels, \nthe price Plaintiffs and Class members paid for extended-release quetiapine \nfumarate in the Randa/Par Strengths.\"), 191 (\"The Randa Non-Compete \nAgreement ... fixed and maintained, at supracompetitive levels, the price \nPlaintiffs and Class members paid for extended-release quetiapine fumarate in the \nRanda/Par Strengths.\"), 214 (\"AstraZeneca ... fixed and maintained, at \nsupracompetitive levels, the price Plaintiffs and Class members paid for extended\u00ad\nrelease quetiapine fumarate.\"); see also D.I. 135 ilil 27, 154, 199, 207 (also alleging \nprice-fixing). And, in any event, even though the quoted language from Klehr uses \nprice-fixing as an example of a continuing antitrust violation, the Court did not \nlimit its summary of antitrust statute of limitations law to price-fixing conspiracies. \nDefendants have offered, and I can think of, no reason to distinguish the alleged \nconspiracy here from a price-fixing conspiracy for statute of limitations purposes. \nDefendants say that price-fixing conspiracies \"are fundamentally different than \n23 other types of antitrust violations,\" because they \"confer 'unlawfully acquired \nmarket power,'\" and therefore \"each time the conspirators 'use[] that power (i.e., \neach sale), they commit[] an overt act.\"' D.I. 154 at 5 (alterations in the original) \n(quoting In re Propane Tank, 860 F.3d 1059, 1067 (8th Cir. 2017)). But the \noperative complaint alleges that AstraZeneca \"possessed substantial market power \n(i.e., monopoly power)\" \"[a]t all relevant times prior to November 1, 2016,\" D.I. \n1351189, and the challenged agreements gave Par and Accord 100% of the U.S. \nsales respectively for their generic dosages during the 180-day exclusivity period \nbeginning November 1, 2016, D.I. 1351154. \nDefendants also argue that applying the \"continuing violation\" doctrine set \nforth in Zenith and Klehr to this case will \"render the limitation[s] period never\u00ad\nending.\" D.I. 138 at 10. But the doctrine is \"subject to the separate accrual rule, \nwhere each violation 'starts the statutory period running again' and 'the \ncommission of a separate new overt act [ within the limitations period] generally \ndoes not permit the plaintiff to recover for the injury caused by old overt acts \noutside the limitations period.\"' Heraeus Med. GmbH v. Esschem, Inc., 927 F .3d \n727, 740 (3d Cir. 2019) ( quoting Klehr, 521 U.S. at 189) (alterations in original). \nIn other words, the doctrine merely allows a plaintiff to claim as separate antitrust \nviolations those acts that occurred within four years of the complaint's filing and \n24 that caused the plaintiff to suffer an injury. The four-year statute of limitations \n\"thus remains in full force under the separate accrual rule .... \" Id. at 7 41. \nDefendants argue that the continuing violation doctrine in Zenith and Klehr \nshould not apply here because Plaintiffs have admitted that they were aware of all \nmaterial provisions in the challenged settlement agreements as of October 2011, \nwhen the agreements were publicly announced. D.I. 138 at 6, 11. But the Court in \nKlehr expressly rejected the notion that knowledge of the anticompetitive conduct \nhad any bearing on the continuing violation analysis. As the Court stated in Klehr, \n\"each sale to the plaintiffl] starts the statutory period running again, regardless of \nthe plaintiff's knowledge of the alleged illegality at much earlier times.\" 521 U.S. \nat 189 ( emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nI also reject Defendants' theory of the statutory limitations on policy \ngrounds. Under their theory, parties could agree to divvy up a market for the \npurpose of raising prices but evade antitrust liability simply by waiting four years \nto raise prices and reap the profits of their illegal agreement. For good reason, \n\"[t]hat is not the law.\" In re Wholesale Grocery Prod. Antitrust Litig., 752 F.3d \n728, 736 (8th Cir. 2014). Rather, \"[u]nder Klehr, a monopolist commits an overt \nact each time [it] uses unlawfully acquired market power to charge an elevated \nprice.\" Id. \n25 Finally, I note that in reaching this conclusion, I join the majority of courts \nthat have ruled on the issue. Since Actavis, courts have reliably concluded that \neach overpriced sale of a drug resulting from a reverse payment agreement gives \nrise to a new cause of action. See, e.g., Mayor of Baltimore v. Actelion Pharms. \nLtd., 995 F.3d 123, 132 (4th Cir. 2021) (\"Virtually every court faced with similar \nallegations has held, citing the continuing-violation doctrine, that a new cause of \naction accrues to purchasers upon each overpriced sale of the drug.\" (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted)); In re EpiPen (Epinephrine Injection, USP) \nMktg., Sales Pracs. & Antitrust Litig., 336 F. Supp. 3d 1256, 1329 (D. Kan. 2018) \n(\"[D]efendants engaged in new and additional acts each time they charged the \nallegedly inflated prices for the EpiPen. And each of those acts inflicted a new and \naccumulating injury on the class plaintiffs .... \"); In re Effexor Antitrust Litig., 357 \nF. Supp. 3d 363,385 (D.N.J. 2018) (\"'[E]very court to have considered [the \napplicability of the continuing violation doctrine] in the pay-for-delay context has \nheld that a new cause of action accrues to purchasers upon each overpriced sale of \nthe drug.\"' (quoting In re Niaspan Antitrust Litig., 42 F. Supp. 3d 735, 746-747 \n(E.D. Pa. 2014)); In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 968 F. Supp. 2d \n367, 400 (D. Mass. 2013) (holding that \"every time the Direct Purchasers were \novercharged for [the branded drug], they suffered a cognizable injury\" that gave \nrise to a new cause of action); see also 6 Louis Altman & Malla Pollack, Statutes \n26 of limitations-Accrual of Cause of Action, Callmann on Unfair Competition, \nTrade & Monopolies\u00a7 23:32 (4th ed. 2021) (\"Every court to have considered [the \ncontinuing tort rule] in the pharmaceutical patent settlement, pay-for-delay context \nhas held that a new cause of action accrues to purchasers upon each overpriced sale \nof the drug.\"). \nIn sum, I find that the Direct Purchasers' federal antitrust claims are not \nbarred by the statute of limitations. \n2. Whether the Direct Purchasers Have Pleaded Antitrust \nStanding \n\"In order to maintain an antitrust suit, a plaintiff must establish antitrust \nstanding, which is distinct from Article III standing.\" In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust \nLitig. Indirect Purchaser Class, 868 F.3d 132, 163 (3d Cir. 2017) (footnote and \ncitations omitted). The requirement of antitrust standing exists for prudential \nreasons. Id. Antitrust violations can \"cause ripples of harm to flow through the \nNation's economy\" but \"Congress did not intend to allow every person tangentially \naffected by an antitrust violation to maintain an action\" under the Sherman Act. \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of \nCarpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 534-35 (1983) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted). Accordingly, district courts must consider as a threshold matter \"whether \nthe plaintiff is a proper party to bring [the] private antitrust action.\" Id. at 535 \nn.31. \n27 \"To establish antitrust standing, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered an \nantitrust injury-that is, an 'injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to \nprevent and that flows from that which makes [the] defendants' acts unlawful.\"' \nWellbutrin, 868 F.3d at 164 (citation and footnotes omitted) (alterations in \noriginal). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to meet this standard \nbecause they have not alleged facts that plausibly imply that the harm they say the \nDirect Purchasers suffered-being forced to pay supracompetitive prices for \nSeroquel XR\u00ae because ofHanda/Par's and Accord's delayed entry into the generic \nmarket-flowed from (i.e., was caused by) the settlement agreements they say \nwere unlawful. \na. The Handal AstraZeneca Settlement Agreement \nDefendants argue that the Handal AstraZeneca settlement agreement \"did not \ninjure Plaintiffs because Randa's product lacked FDA approval until May 2017-\nlong after the period when Plaintiffs claim they should have been able to buy it\u00ad\nand so the launch was blocked by [the] FDA, not Defendants.\" D.I. 138 at 15. But \nthe Direct Purchasers allege in the operative complaint that the FDA had \ntentatively approved Banda' s AND A in 2010 after \"determining that Randa's \nANDA for generic Seroquel XR[\u00ae] was approvable and satisfied all \nbioequivalence; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls ('CMC'); and labeling \nrequirements,\" D.I. 135 113; that the FDA was unable to give final approval of \n28 Randa's ANDA at that time because of the 30-month stay that was triggered when \nAstraZeneca sued Banda for infringement, D.I. 135 ,r 13; and that, but for Randa's \nsettlement agreement with AstraZeneca, Banda/Par would have obtained final \nFDA approval for and sold Banda/Par's dosages of generic Seroquel XR\u00ae before \nNovember 1, 2016, D.I. 135 ,r,r 16, 86, 126. \nDefendants argue that this latter allegation-that Banda/Par would have \nobtained final FDA approval before November 1, 2016-\"is belied by FDA record, \nwhich is incorporated into the [operative] [c]omplaint[s].\" D.I. 138 at 18. In \nsupport of this assertion, they point to a sentence in the FDA's May 2017 final \napproval letter for Banda/Par's ANDA. D.I. 138 at 19. That sentence reads: \n\"Reference is also made to the tentative approval letter issued by this office on \nDecember 9, 2010, the complete response letter issued by this office on January \n27, 2014, and to your amendments dated January 31, 2014; December 21, 2016; \nand January 12 (two amendments), March 15, and May 5, 2017.\" D.I. 143, Ex. 10, \nat 1. According to Defendants, \na [ complete response letter] signifies that FDA will \"not \napprove the [ANDA] in its present form.\" 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n314.ll0(a). The [complete response letter] required \nadditional information as a prerequisite for approval, and \nBanda/Par had to amend the ANDA five separate times \n( a total of six amendments) between January 31, 2014 \nand May 5, 2017 before receiving final approval on May \n9, 2017. \n29 D.I. 138 at 19 (second alteration in original). \nBut neither the FDA's issuance of the complete response letter in 2014 nor \nthe fact that Banda/Par amended its ANDA between that time and when it received \nfinal approval in May 2017 contradict Plaintiffs' allegation that, but for the \nHandal AstraZeneca settlement agreement, Banda/Par would have received final \napproval of its ANDA before November 1, 2016. Nothing in the FDA's final \napproval letter suggests that the FDA rescinded its December 2010 tentative \napproval or revoked its \"determin[ation]\" that Randa's ANDA as of that date \"was \napprovable and satisfied all bioequivalence; chemistry, manufacturing, and \ncontrols ('CMC'); and labeling requirements.\" D.I. 135 if 13. The final approval \nletter does not state why the FDA sent Banda/Par the 2014 complete response \nletter or why Banda/Par amended its ANDA; it does not identify the issues raised \nin the complete response letter or when or how Banda/Par resolved those issues to \nthe FDA's satisfaction; and it does not say that Banda/Par's amendments to its \nANDA were made in response to issues raised in the complete response letter. \nDefendants in effect ask me to extrapolate from the issuance of the 2014 \ncomplete response letter and Randa/Par's subsequent ANDA amendments only \ninferences unfavorable to Plaintiffs. But there are plausible explanations for the \nletter and the ANDA amendments that are consistent with Plaintiffs' allegation \nthat, but for the Handal AstraZeneca settlement agreement, Banda/Par would have \n30 obtained final FDA approval before November 1, 2016. For example, in light of \nthe substantial reverse payment Handa/Par received and its decision to exercise its \noption to launch sales in November 2016 using AG product supplied by \nAstraZeneca, it is plausible to infer from the issuance of the complete response \nletter and ANDA amendments that Randa/Par decided sometime between 2011 \nand 2014 not to launch its own product until May 2017 and to make in the interim \nvoluntary changes to its product or manufacturing processes that required later \ninteraction with the FDA. As the Direct Purchasers allege in the operative \ncomplaint, \n[i]t is ... not unusual for generic companies that have \nentered into pay-for-delay agreements with brand \ncompanies to use the interim period of time between the \nagreement and the delayed entry date to make \nadjustments to certain aspects of their ANDA that would \u00b7 \notherwise not be made or would ordinarily be made post\u00ad\napproval and post-commercial launch. \nIt is also often the case that FDA is made aware of \nParagraph IV patent litigation settlements between brand \nand generic companies, as well as the agreed upon entry \ndate. Given the limited resources of FDA, it has no \ninterest in working to grant immediate final approval to \nANDAs for generic drugs that are not slated, because of \nan agreement between the generic and brand companies, \nto enter the market for several years. Most often, and \nregardless of its knowledge or lack of knowledge about \npatent litigation settlements, FDA will simply wait, or \neven require that generic companies initiate additional, \nfinal approval activities nearer in time to the date that the \n31 generics know they are eligible or desire to enter the \nmarket with their ANDA-based products. \nIn the context of the facts at issue here, after settling with \nAstraZeneca in 2011 with a generic entry date years \nahead in exchange for a reverse payment, Banda ( and \neventually Par) ... had no interest in obtaining, and no \nneed to obtain, final approval of [its] respective generic \nSeroquel XR[\u00ae] ANDAs in the near term, and the FDA, \nlikewise, had no interest or need to grant such final \napproval until the agreed generic launch date was \nneanng . \n. . . AstraZeneca and Banda/Par delayed the launch of \nRanda's generic Seroquel XR[\u00ae] 50, 150, 200 and 300 \nmg products until November 1, 2016, and Banda/Par had \nthe additional contractual right and economic incentive to \nlaunch and sell generic product as supplied to it by \nAstraZeneca for at least 180 days at least in part because \nBanda/Par could avoid manufacturing responsibilities \nand costs by distributing product supplied by \nAstraZeneca. Thus Banda ( and Par) had no incentive to \nseek final approval for its ANDA versions of these \nmilligram strengths until approximately 180 days after \nNovember 1, 2016. Banda (and eventually Par) and FDA \ngeared their respective resources towards final approval \nof their ANDA-based products for May 2017. Par \nlaunched less expensive generic versions of 5 0, 15 0, 200 \nand 300 mg Seroquel XR[\u00ae] on November 1, 2016 with \nproduct as supplied by AstraZeneca, and thereafter \nobtained final ANDA approval from FDA for those same \nmilligram strengths in early May 2017. Again, this \nsequence of events was no coincidence, but a direct result \nof the agreed entry date that AstraZeneca had purchased \nwith its large reverse payment to Banda. \nD.I. 135 ,r,r 82-86. \n32 Although evidence produced during discovery may ultimately show that \nRanda/Par would not have obtained final FDA approval before November 1, 2016, \nfor the purposes of the pending motions, I am required to accept the operative \ncomplaints' allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs. Adopting Defendants' arguments would require me to draw from the \nalleged facts only negative inferences against the Plaintiffs. Viewed in the light \nmost favorable to Plaintiffs, the Handal AstraZeneca agreement forced the Direct \nPurchasers to pay supracompetitive prices and therefore caused them to suffer \nantitrust injury. \nb. The Accord/ AstraZeneca Settlement Agreement \nDefendants argue that the Accord/AstraZeneca agreement \"did not injure \nPlaintiffs because Accord's generic infringed a valid patent, and so its launch was \nblocked by the patent laws.\" D.I. 138 at 15. As noted above, unlike Randa/Par, \nAccord conceded in its ANDA litigation with AstraZeneca that it infringed the \n#437 patent. See D.I. 144-2 il 77. Thus, at the time they struck their settlement \nagreement, both Accord and AstraZeneca knew that without such an agreement, \nAccord could not lawfully enter the market before May 28, 2017 unless it won at \ntrial on its invalidity defenses. D.I. 135 il 5 (noting the expiration date of the #437 \npatent); D.I. 144-2 il 6 (same). \n33 The Direct Purchasers, however, do not allege in the operative complaint \nany facts that plausibly imply that the #43 7 patent had weaknesses that would have \nenabled Accord to prevail at trial on its invalidity defenses; nor do they allege any \nfacts that plausibly imply that AstraZeneca or Accord believed that Accord could \nprevail at trial. According to Defendants, these failures are \"no accident\" because \nthe four generics that proceeded to trial after the Accord/ AstraZeneca settlement \nwas reached lost their invalidity challenges both at trial and then on appeal before \nthe Federal Circuit. D.I. 138 at 16. Thus, in Defendants' view of things, the Direct \nPurchasers \"are unable to muster any allegation that Accord could have launched \nits generic without infringing AstraZeneca's valid patent,\" and this inability \nprecludes the Direct Purchasers from alleging antitrust injury. D.I. 138 at 16. \nPlaintiffs do not address the merits of this argument in their briefing. \nInstead, they say that the operative complaint alleges \"that earlier generic entry [by \nAccord] would have occurred ... through [a] settlement[] without an unlawful \n'pay-for-delay' term and concomitant earlier generic entry date, i.e., a 'Lawful \nSettlement[.]\"' D.I. 148 at 9; see also D.I. 147 at 12 (arguing that \"Accord would \nhave entered ... via an alternative settlement with earlier entry and no reverse \npayment\"). And, they argue, this \"theory\" of liability \"moots\" Defendants' \nargument that the #437 patent's validity precludes the Direct Purchasers from \nalleging antitrust injury. D.I. 148 at 10; see also D.I. 147 at 14 (arguing that \"entry \n34 ... pursuant to a license from the patent holder necessarily constitutes lawful \nentry\"). \nPlaintiffs are correct insofar as the operative complaint makes the \nconclusory allegations that \"it would have been economically rational for \nAstraZeneca to have launched authorized generic Seroquel XR[\u00ae] \ncontemporaneously with market entry by Randa/Par and Accord instead of after \nRanda/Par's and Accord's 180-day exclusivity periods\" and that, \"[a]bsent the \nAccord Non-Compete Agreement, AstraZeneca would have launched authorized \ngeneric Seroquel XR[\u00ae] in the 400 mg strength contemporaneous with Accord's \n' \nlaunch of generic Seroquel XR[\u00ae] in the 400 mg strength.\" D.I. 135 1 144 \n( emphasis omitted). And the complaint also alleges that \"AstraZeneca often \ncompetes with first-filers by launching authorized generics,\" D.I. 1351141, and \nthat \"[i]t is economically rational for a brand manufacturer that intends to compete \nfor generic sales by launching an authorized generic to do so contemporaneously \nwith the first ANDA filer's launch\" because, \"during the first-filer's 180-day \nexclusivity, the only possible competitors for generic sales are the first-filer and the \nbrand's authorized generic,\" D.I. 1351143. \nBut there are no non-conclusory factual allegations in the operative \ncomplaint that plausibly imply that it would have been economically rational for \nAstraZeneca to enter into an alternative settlement agreement with Accord under \n35 the circumstances presented by the operative complaint-i.e., where Accord \nconceded that it infringed the #43 7 patent and in the absence of any allegation that \nthe #43 7 patent was invalid or weak such that Accord could have prevailed or \nbelieved that it could have prevailed at trial on its invalidity defenses. At oral \nargument, Plaintiffs argued that the $107 million value of the reverse payment is \nsufficiently large that, under Actavis, it \"can serve as a proxy for patent weakness.\" \nD.I. 175 at 88:1-5. But the operative complaint has no allegations that allow for \nplausible inferences to be drawn about whether $107 million is sufficiently \"large\" \nor \"unjustified\" under Actavis to sustain a reverse payment antitrust claim. \nAlthough the average citizen views $107 million as a huge sum, that is not the case \nfor large pharmaceutical companies engaged in patent litigation. As alleged in the \noperative complaint, AstraZeneca's annual sales of brand Seroquel XR\u00ae in the \nUnited States exceeded $1 billion, D.I. 135 ~ 2; and it has been on the market since \n2007, see AstraZeneca Pharms., 2012 WL 1065458, at *4 (noting that the \"FDA \napproved sustained release quetiapine fumarate tablets for the treatment of \nschizophrenia in May 2007\"). Those kinds of revenue figures breed patent \nlitigation, and multi-billion dollar jury awards in pharmaceutical patent cases are \nnot uncommon. See, e.g., Juno Therapeutics, Inc. v. Kite Pharma, Inc., 10 F.4th \n1330, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (reviewing $1.2 billion verdict); Centocor Ortho \nBiotech, Inc. v. Abbott Lab ys, 636 F.3d 1341, 1343-44 (Fed. Cir. 2011) \n36 (reviewing $1.67 billion verdict); Idenix Pharms. LLC v. Gilead Scis., Inc., 2018 \nWL 922125, at *1 (D. Del. Feb. 16, 2018) (reviewing $2.54 billion verdict). Thus, \nthe allegation that the reverse payment was worth $107 million is by itself \ninsufficient to support a plausible inference that AstraZeneca made a large and \nunjustified payment because it had serious doubts about the patent's validity. See \nActavis, 570 U.S. at 157. \nPlaintiffs argue that \"[n]umerous courts have ... recognized that a plaintiff \ncan prove earlier generic entry 'but-for' a reverse payment by proving that rational, \nprofit-maximizing companies still would have settled, but without a reverse \npayment and with earlier generic entry.\" D.I. 148 at 10-11 (collecting cases). But \nin four of the five cases they cite in support of this assertion, the plaintiffs alleged \nthat the patent at issue was or was likely to be found infringed, invalid, and/or \nunenforceable. See In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig., 433 F. Supp. 3d 274, 298 \n(D.R.I. 2019) (noting that the \"Defendants' allegedly anticompetitive conduct[] \ninclud[ ed] protecting Loestrin with a patent Warner Chilcott knew was invalid\"); \nIn re Androgel Antitrust Litig. (No. 11), 2018 WL 2984873, at *16 (N.D. Ga. June \n14, 2018) (explaining that part of the plaintiffs' evidence was expert testimony that \n\"[the brand manufacturer] likely viewed its chances of winning [the patent \ninfringement case] to be at about 33%\"); In re Solodyn (Minocycline \nHydrochloride) Antitrust Litig., 2018 WL 563144, at *14 (D. Mass. Jan. 25, 2018) \n37 (noting that the \"[p]laintiffs argue[d] that their evidence demonstrates that the \n[#]838 patent was invalid for obviousness\"); United Food & Com. Workers Loe. \n1776 & Participating Emps. Health & Welfare Fundv. Teikoku Pharma USA, 296 \nF. Supp. 3d 1142, 1151 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (noting that the \"[p]laintiffs counter[ed] \nthat ... [they] ha[ d] ample evidence from which a reasonable juror could \ndetermine that [the ANDA filer] would have prevailed in the patent litigation\"). \nAnd, in the fifth case, the plaintiffs defeated summary judgment by providing \nevidence that the brand's settlement offer far exceeded both the brand's expected \nlitigation expenses and the generic's likely profits if the generic succeeded in an \nANDA trial. See In re Namenda Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 331 F. Supp. 3d \n152, 196, 199 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). Thus, none of the cited cases support Plaintiffs' \nposition that, to sustain an antitrust claim under Actavis, a plaintiff need only make \nthe conclusory assertion that it would have been rational for the defendants to have \nsettled their ANDA litigation without a reverse payment and with earlier generic \nentry. \nPlaintiffs also argue that \"causation is rarely an appropriate basis for \ndismissal on the pleadings.\" D.I. 147 at 11. I do not dispute that observation as a \ngeneral matter, but it has no application here. Under Iqbal, the Direct Purchasers \nwere required to plead factual content that allows for a plausible inference that the \nAccord/ AstraZeneca settlement agreement unlawfully caused the delay of \n38 Accord's entry into the generic market under Actavis. But the Direct Purchasers \nalleged no facts from which it can be plausibly inferred that the $107 million non\u00ad\ncash reverse payment AstraZeneca made to Accord was an \"unexplained large \nreverse payment\" inconsistent with traditional settlement considerations and \nsuggestive of serious doubts by AstraZeneca about the survival of the #43 7 patent. \nSee Actavis, 570 U.S. at 157. \nFinally, Plaintiffs make passing reference to two alternative theories of \nantitrust injury. Without any elaboration, they say that but for the settlement \nagreement Accord would have \"entered [the market] (1) at risk[] [and] (2) \nfollowing a patent litigation victory .... \" D.I. 147 at 12; see also D.I. 148 at 9-\n10. They allege no facts in support of these conclusory allegations, and therefore \nthey are inadequate to sustain a claim under Iqbal. 556 U.S. at 663 (\"[T]he tenet \nthat a court must accept a complaint's allegations as true is inapplicable to \nthreadbare recitals of a cause of action's elements, supported by mere conclusory \nstatements.\"). Plaintiffs also intimate in a single sentence in the Retailers' briefing \nthat a no-AG agreement is per se anticompetitive and injurious. See D.I. 147 at 17 \n(\"Retailer Plaintiffs can recover overcharges merely by showing that AstraZeneca \ndelayed the launch of an AG for six months .... \"); D.I. 148 at 19 (similar). But \nthey cite no case law in support of this bare assertion and make no attempt to justify \nor explain the assertion. This \"passing reference to an issue will not suffice to \n39 bring that issue before this court.\" Skretvedt v. E.1. DuPont De Nemours, 372 F.3d \n193, 202-03 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see \nalso John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Int'! Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d \nCir. 1997) (\"[A]rguments raised in passing (such as, in a footnote), but not \nsquarely argued, are considered waived.\" ( citation omitted)). \nFor these reasons, I find that the Direct Purchasers failed to adequately plead \nantitrust injury caused by the Accord/ AstraZeneca settlement agreement. I will \ntherefore dismiss the federal antitrust claims that are based on that agreement; but I \nwill deny the motion to dismiss the federal antitrust claims that are based on the \nBanda/AstraZeneca settlement agreement. In addition, because the End-Payors do \nnot dispute Defendants' contention that, if the Direct Purchasers' federal antitrust \nclaims should be dismissed, the End-Payors' state law claims should also be \ndismissed, D.I. 140 at 2, I will also dismiss the End-Payors' claims to the extent \nthat they are based on the Accord/ AstraZeneca settlement agreement. \nB. The End-Payors' State Law Claims \nI turn then to the End-Pay ors' state law claims that are based on the \nHandal AstraZeneca settlement agreement. \nAs noted above, the End-Payors did not purchase Seroquel XR\u00ae from \nAstraZeneca or Banda/Par. Rather, they reimbursed others who made such \npurchases and thus were so-called indirect purchasers. Consistent with its antitrust \n40 standing requirement, the Supreme Court held in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 \nU.S. 720, 730, 735 (1977), that indirect purchasers cannot bring federal antitrust \nclaims. Indirect purchasers, however, can assert antitrust claims under various \nstate laws; and the End-Payors have alleged here various state law antitrust claims \nunder the laws of 35 states and the District of Columbia. The End-Payors have \nalso alleged statute-based consumer protection11 claims and common law unjust \nenrichment claims. D.I. 136 ~~ 233-95. Defendants have moved to dismiss some \nof the End-Payors' state law claims for lack of standing, inadequate pleadings, and \nsubstantive deficiencies. \n1. Antitrust Claims \nDefendants argue that the End-Payors' antitrust claims under the laws of 15 \nstates should be dismissed for lack of Article III standing, that their claims under \nthe laws of five states should be dismissed for lack of antitrust injury, and that the \nclaims brought under the laws of four states should be dismissed for failure to \nallege intra-state effects. \n11 I use \"consumer protection\" throughout as shorthand for the set of state statutes \nunder which the End-Payors bring their \"Fourth Claim for Relief' titled \"Unfair or \nDeceptive Trade Practices.\" D.I. 136 ~~ 277-79. \n41 a. Article III Standing \nDefendants argue first that the End-Payors lack Article III standing to assert \nclaims brought under the laws of 15 jurisdictions-Alabama, Arkansas, District of \nColumbia, Hawaii, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North \nDakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin\u00ad\nbecause no named End-Payor is alleged to have \"'paid and/or reimbursed' for \nSeroquel XR\u00ae 'in' [those] states[.]\" D.I. 140 at 9. Neither the Supreme Court nor \nthe Third Circuit has addressed whether named plaintiffs in a class action have \nstanding to assert on behalf of others claims under the laws of states in which no \njurisdiction lies over the named plaintiffs. \nThe courts that have addressed whether a named plaintiff has standing to \nassert claims that only putative class members may advance are split. The \nSupreme Court has acknowledged that there is \"tension\" in its own caselaw about \nwhether \"variation\" between a named plaintiffs claims and the claims of putative \nclass members \"is a matter of Article III standing ... or ... goes to the propriety of \nclass certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).\" Gratz v. \nBollinger, 539 U.S. 244,263 & n.15 (2003). \nAlthough I see merit in Defendants' position on this interesting issue, for \npragmatic reasons I will defer the standing analysis required by Article III until \nafter class certification has been resolved under Rule 23. This decision is \n42 consistent with the Third Circuit's approach in Georgine v. Amchem Prod., Inc., 83 \nF.3d 610, 623 (3d Cir. 1996), aff'd sub nom. Amchem Prod., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 \nU.S. 591 (1997). At issue in Georgine was the legitimacy of a district court's \nclass-action certification that sought to achieve a settlement of asbestos-related \nclaims. The Third Circuit vacated the class certification without resolving difficult \nArticle III standing issues raised in the case. The Court explained: \nAlthough the existence of justiciability and subject matter \njurisdiction are not free from doubt, ... we decline to \nreach these issues, and pass on to the class certification \nissues. The class certification issues are dispositive, and \nwe believe it prudent not to decide issues unnecessary to \nthe disposition of the case, especially when many of \nthese issues implicate constitutional questions. In doing \nso, we offend no principle of constitutional law, for the \njurisdictional issues in this case would not exist but for \nthe certification of this class action .... Moreover, a \ncourt need not reach difficult questions of jurisdiction \nwhen the case can be resolved on some other ground in \nfavor of the same party. \nGeorgine, 83 F.3d at 623. In upholding the Third Circuit's decision, the Supreme \nCourt \"agree( d]\" that the class certification issues were dispositive and that, \n\"because their resolution here is logically antecedent to the existence of any Article \nIII issues, it is appropriate to reach them first.\" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 612 (citation \nomitted). \nI recognize that my holding here reaches beyond Georgine and Amchem in \nthat the Rule 23 issues there were dispositive, whereas the Rule 23 issues here may \n43 be dispositive. But the same prudential considerations that drove the Third Circuit \nin Georgine and the Supreme Court in Ame hem drive my decision. I see no reason \nto wade through complex issues of jurisdiction and constitutional law when \ndeterminations of fact and interpretation of Rule 23 could well resolve the issue. \nTreatment of Rule 23 issues first will not result in the End-Payors' evading their \nobligation to demonstrate standing. \nMy conclusion is also consistent with the decisions of the two courts of \nappeals that have addressed the issue. See Langan v. Johnson & Johnson \nConsumer Cos., 897 F.3d 88, 95 (2d Cir. 2018) (\"[C]onsidering variation[] in state \nlaw[] as [a] question[] of predominance under Rule 23(b)(3), rather than standing \nunder Article III, makes sense [because] ... it acknowledges the obvious truth that \nclass actions necessarily involve plaintiffs litigating injuries that they themselves \nwould not have standing to litigate.\"); In re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d 42, 49 \n(1st Cir. 2018) (\"Our conclusion is in line with our prior precedent ... requir[ing] \nonly that a plaintiff make a single purchase in order to satisfy standing for a claim \nbrought under multiple state laws.\"); see also Mayor of Baltimore, 995 F.3d at \n133-34 (permitting consideration of Rule 23 issues prior to issues of statutory \nstanding). Defendants contend that my deferral of the standing analysis here \n\"overlook[s]\" Neale v. Volvo Cars of North America, 794 F.3d 353 (3d Cir. \n2015). D.I. 140 at 10. District courts in this Circuit are split with respect to \n44 Neale's import when courts evaluate whether a named plaintiff may represent the \nclaims of putative class members. Compare, e.g., In re Sensipar (Cinacalcet \nHydrochloride Tablets) Antitrust Litig., 2022 WL 736250, at* 17 (D. Del. Mar. 11, \n2022) ( dismissing claims in states without named class members for lack of \nstanding and finding Neale dispositive ), with In re Generic Pharms. Pricing \nAntitrust Litig., 368 F. Supp. 3d 814, 829 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (finding Neale did not \naffect whether a district court could defer the standing analysis). But Defendants \nnowhere argue in their briefing that Neale is dispositive binding precedent. And \nthe express holding of the Court in Neale-\"We now squarely hold that unnamed, \nputative class members need not establish Article III standing. Instead, the 'cases \nor controversies' requirement is satisfied so long as a class representative has \nstanding,\" 794 F.3d at 362-does not speak directly to the question before me. \nThus, deferring standing analysis here does not \"overlook[]\" Neale. \nb. Antitrust Standing \nDefendants next contend that the End-Payors lack standing to assert claims \nunder the laws of Florida, Illinois, Maryland, and Massachusetts because these \nstates \"have not enacted statutes that circumvent Illinois Brick's holding that only \ndirect purchasers have standing to sue for damages .... \" D.I. 140 at 10. \n45 1) Florida (Counts II and III) \nDefendants argue that \"[i]ndirect purchasers do not suffer cognizable injury \nunder the Florida Antitrust Act.\" D.I. 140 at 10 (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). But the End-Payor Plaintiffs seek relief under the Florida \nDeceptive and Unfair Trade Practice Act (FDUTP A), not the Florida Antitrust Act. \nD.I. 136 ,r,r 257(d), 274(d) (citing Fla. Stat.\u00a7\u00a7 501.201-501.213); D.I. 150 at 12 & \nn.10. And the FDUPT A permits indirect purchasers to bring claims. See Mack v. \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co., 673 So. 2d 100, 110-11 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996) \n(\"[T]he Florida DTPA clearly expresses the legislative policy to authorize \nconsumers ( that is, indirect purchasers) to bring actions under the Florida DTP A \nfor price-fixing conduct.\"); see also Generic Pharms., 368 F. Supp. 3d at 840 & \nn.114 (citing In re Fla. Microsoft Antitrust Litig., 2002 WL 31423620, at *2 (Fla. \nCir. Ct. Aug. 26, 2002) (\"Indirect purchasers of a monopolist's or price fixer's \nproducts, such as Plaintiffs here, may bring suit under the [FDUTPA].\")). \n2) Illinois (Counts 1-111) \nDefendants' standing argument with respect to the End-Payors' Illinois \nantitrust claims comprises three sentences: \n[Section 7(2) of] [t]he Illinois Antitrust Act provides: \"no \nperson shall be authorized to maintain a class action in \nany court of this State for indirect purchasers asserting \nclaims under this Act, with the sole exception of this \nState's Attorney General.\" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. \n10/7. A \"majority of courts,\" including courts in the \n46 Third Circuit, have held that this statute is \"substantive\" \nin nature because, among other things, it is \"intertwined \nwith Illinois substantive rights and remedies.\" See, e.g., \nIn re Lipitor, 336 F. Supp. 3d 395, 414-18 (D.N.J. 2018) \n( collecting cases; discussing and applying Shady Grove \nOrthopedic Assocs. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 \n(2010)); see also In re Novartis & Par, 2019 WL \n3841711, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2019). Because \nfederal district courts \"must utilize ... state substantive \nlaw,\" [the End-Payors'] Illinois claims are barred. \nLipitor, 336 F. Supp. 3d at 414. \nD.I. 140 at 11 (ellipses in original). \nThe End-Payors counter in their answering brief that the express language of \nsection 7(2) prohibits class actions only in Illinois state courts. D.I. 140 at 12-13. \nThey also note that two federal district courts applied Shady Grove Orthopedic \nAssocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), in holding that section 7(2) \nis a procedural limitation and, consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, \ndoes not preclude a plaintiff from bringing Illinois antitrust claims in a class action \nfiled in federal court. D.I. 150 at 13 (citing In re Broiler Chicken, 290 F. Supp. 3d \n772, 817-18 (N.D. Ill. 2017), and In re Liquid Aluminum Sulfate Antitrust Litig., \n2017 WL 3131977, *18-19 (D.N.J. July 20, 2017)). \nIn their reply brief, Defendants write: \"[The End-Payors] assert that Shady \nGrove ... saves their Illinois claims. Wrong. Post-Shady Grove, courts in this \nCircuit continue to hold that the Illinois Antitrust Act prohibits class actions.\" D.I. \n155 at 6 (citations omitted). Defendants did not address in their reply brief the \n47 End-Payors' argument that the express language of section 7(2) prohibits class \nactions only in Illinois state courts. \n\"[A]s a practical matter, when, as in this case, a party merely states an \nargument in conclusory fashion in its opening brief and then files a reply brief but \ndoes not contest in that brief the specific rebuttal points made in the answering \nbrief, a court may rightly conclude that the party implicitly conceded those points. \nFailure to contest the rebuttal points in such circumstances is 'not necessarily a \nwaiver, but it is a risky tactic, and sometimes fatal.\"' Progressive Sterilization, \nLLC v. Turbett Surgical LLC, 2020 WL 3071951, at *2 (D. Del. June 10, 2020) \n(quoting Law v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F.3d 781, 787 (7th Cir. 1997)); see also \nHardy v. City Optical Inc., 39 F.3d 765, 771 (7th Cir. 1994) (stating that the failure \nto respond in a reply brief to a point made in an answering brief \"waives, as a \npractical matter anyway, any objections not obvious to the court to specific points \nurged\" in the answering brief). As the Court noted in Hardy, \"[i]n an adversary \nsystem, in which by its nature judges are heavily dependent on the lawyers to \nestablish the facts upon which decision will be based, the failure to reply to an \nadversary's point can have serious consequences.\" 39 F.3d at 771. \nUnder the circumstances present here, I will treat Defendants' failure to \naddress whether the express language of section 7(2) prohibits indirect purchaser \nclass actions only in Illinois state courts as implicitly conceding the point for the \n48 purposes of the pending motion; and I will therefore allow the End-Payors' Illinois \nantitrust claims to proceed. On its face, the language quoted by the parties from \nthe Illinois Antitrust Act appears to concern only Illinois state courts. Nothing in \nthe quoted text says or implies that the limitation prohibits a plaintiff from \nasserting Illinois antitrust claims in class actions filed in federal courts. It would \nalso be imprudent to interpret Shady Grove without the benefit of fulsome briefing \nby the parties. It can be safely said that a majority of the Court in Shady Grove \nheld that a New York statute prohibiting class actions \"in suits seeking penalties or \nstatutory minimum damages\" did not bar a class action for claims under New York \nlaw in federal court. 559 U.S. at 411 (plurality). But Justice Scalia in his plurality \nopinion and Justice Stevens in his concurring opinion reached that holding by very \ndifferent routes. Id. (\"The concurrence would decide this case on the basis, not \nthat Rule 23 is procedural [ as the plurality does], but that the state law it displaces \nis procedural .... \"). Courts are understandably divided on the question of whether \nJustice Stevens' s concurring opinion is controlling. See Knepper v. Rite Aid Corp., \n675 F.3d 249,265 (3d Cir. 2012) (conducting analysis under both the Scalia and \nStevens frameworks); Lisk v. Lumber One Wood Preserving, LLC, 792 F.3d 1331, \n1335-37 (11th Cir. 2015) (leaving \"unresolved\" whether the Scalia or the Stevens \nopinion controls because of the \"uncertainty\" presented); In re Aggrenox Antitrust \nLitig., 2016 WL 4204478, at *5 (D. Conn. Aug. 9, 2016) (expressing \"some doubt\" \n49 that the Stevens concurrence controls); 3M Co. v. Boulter, 842 F. Supp. 2d 85, 95 \n(D.D.C. 2012) (finding Justice Scalia's opinion controlling as to one question); In \nre Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 756 F. Supp. 2d 670, 675 (E.D. Pa. 2010) \n( collecting cases and finding that \"[l]ower courts have also concluded that Justice \nStevens'[s] Rules Enabling Analysis in Shady Grove is controlling\"). Courts are \nsimilarly divided on the specific question posed here of whether Shady Grove \nallows for Illinois antitrust claims to be brought in a federal class action suit. \nCompare In re Lipitor Antitrust Litig., 336 F. Supp. 3d 395, 418 (D.N.J. 2018) \n(\"The language of the [Illinois Antitrust] Act presents a substantive conflict with \nRule 23 .... \"), with Broiler Chicken, 290 F. Supp. 3d at 817 (\"Shady Grove's \nreasoning with respect to New York's class action ban is equally applicable to \nIllinois's requirement .... \"). \nAccordingly, I will deny Defendants' request to dismiss the End-Payors' \nIllinois antitrust claims for lack of standing. \n3) Maryland (Counts 1-111) \nMaryland amended its Antitrust Act on October 1, 2017 to allow for claims \nby indirect purchasers. Md. Code Ann., Com. Law\u00a7 1 l-209(b)(2)(ii). Defendants \nargue that the amendment does not apply retroactively and that the End-Pay ors' \nMaryland claims should therefore be dismissed since the alleged harms occurred \nbefore October 1, 2017. D.I. 140 11-12. \n50 Under Maryland law, statutes that affect substantive rights are presumed to \noperate prospectively only. Landsman v. Md. Home Improvement Comm 'n, 839 \nA.2d 743, 749 (Md. 2003). Nothing in the Maryland Antirust Act states or \nsuggests that the 2017 amendment applies retroactively. See Md. Code Ann., \nCom. Law\u00a7\u00a7 11-201-213. Accordingly, since the amendment created a \nsubstantive right on the part of indirect purchasers to bring suit on claims they had \nno right to bring prior to the amendment, it applies only prospectively. In re Hard \nDisk Drive Suspension Assemblies Antitrust Litig., 2021 WL 4306018, at *7 (N.D. \nCal. Sept. 22, 2021) ( citing State Comm 'n on Hum. Reis. v. Amecom Div. of Litton \nSys., Inc., 360 A.2d 1, 5 (1976)). \nThe pre-2017 version of the Maryland Antitrust Act, however, permitted \npolitical subdivisions of the state to pursue actions \"regardless of whether [the \npolitical subdivision] dealt directly or indirectly with the person who has \ncommitted the violation.\" Md. Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7 11-209(b )(2)(ii) (West \n2017); 2017 Maryland Laws Ch. 842 (S.B. 858). One of the named End-Payors is \nthe Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and the operative complaint alleges that \nthis Plaintiff is a \"municipality.\" D.I. 136 ,r 34. Accordingly, the Mayor and City \nCouncil of Baltimore and any putative Maryland political subdivision are not \nprecluded from asserting claims under the Maryland Antitrust Act. I will, \nhowever, dismiss counts I-III of the End-Payors' operative complaint to the extent \n51 that the claims are asserted under Maryland law by any other Plaintiff based on \npurchases made before October 1, 2017. \n4) Massachusetts (Counts III and IV) \nThe End-Payors bring their Massachusetts antitrust and consumer protection \nclaims under the Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, titled \"Regulation of \nBusiness Practices for Consumers Protection.\" See D.I. 136 ,-r,-r 274k, 278d; see \nalso D.I. 150 at 14. Section 11 of Chapter 93A provides a right of action to sue for \nunfair practices to \"[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or \ncommerce .... \" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A \u00a7 11. Section 9 of Chapter 93A \nprovides the same right to \"[ a ]ny person, other than a person entitled to bring \naction under section eleven .... \" Id. \u00a7 9. Chapter 93A thus \"distinguishes \nbetween 'consumer' and 'business' claims, the former actionable under\u00a7 9, the \nlatter actionable under\u00a7 11.\" Frullo v. Landenberger, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 814, 821 \n(2004 ). Massachusetts courts apply the Illinois Brick rule to claims brought under \nsection 11, but not to claims brought under section 9. See In re Asacol Antitrust \nLitig., 2016 WL 4083333, at *13 (D. Mass. July 20, 2016); Ciardi v. F. Hoffmann\u00ad\nLa Roche, Ltd., 436 Mass. 53, 62-63 (2002) (noting that, in section 11, but not \nsection 9, actions, \"the court shall be guided in its interpretation of unfair methods \nof competition by the provisions of the [Massachusetts] Antitrust Act,\" which bar \nindirect-purchaser suits pursuant to Illinois Brick). \n52 Defendants argue that the End-Payors lack standing to bring Chapter 93A \nclaims because they were indirect purchasers engaged in commerce. I agree. The \ndistinction between a business claim and a consumer claim under Chapter 93A \n\"[u]ltimately ... tum[s] on whether a given party has undertaken the transaction in \nquestion for business reasons, or has engaged in it for purely personal reasons \n(such as the purchase of an item for personal use).\" Frullo, 61 Mass. App. Ct. at \n821. \" [ A ]ny transaction in which the plaintiff is motivated by business \nconsiderations gives rise to claims only under the statute's business section.\" Id. \nHere, the named End-Payors are organizations that indirectly purchased or made \nreimbursements for Seroquel XR\u00ae in the course of their business or institutional \npractices. D.I. 136 ,r,r 32-38. In their briefing, the End-Payors point to no \nallegations that plausibly imply that the End-Payors were motivated by anything \nother than business considerations. See D.I. 150 at 14, 17. Accordingly, the End\u00ad\nPayors lack antitrust standing to assert claims under Massachusetts law and I will \ndismiss those claims. \n5) Utah (Counts 1-111) \nThe Utah Antitrust Act authorizes suits by \"a person who is a citizen of \n[Utah] or a resident of [Utah].\" Utah Code Ann.\u00a7 76-10-3109(1)(a). Defendants \nargue that the Utah claims must be dismissed because no named End-Payor is a \ncitizen or resident of Utah. There are no allegations in the operative complaint that \n53 a named plaintiff is a Utah citizen or resident. Plaintiffs insist that \"[t]here is no \nstatutory requirement that the named plaintiffs be citizens or residents of Utah,\" \nD.I. 150 at 14; but that assertion is belied by the express language of the Utah \nstatute. To the extent the End-Payors seek to assert claims on behalf of putative \nclass members, the End-Payors allege only that class members \"purchased, paid \nand/or provided reimbursement for\" brand or generic Seroquel XR\u00ae \"in [Utah,]\" \nnot that putative class members are citizens or residents of Utah. D.I. 136 ,r,r 223, \n243w. Accordingly, I will dismiss the End-Payors' Utah claims. \nc. Intra-State Effects \nDefendants say, and the End-Payors' do not dispute, that the antitrust laws \nof New York, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Wisconsin require proof of substantial \nintra-state effects. Defendants argue that the End-Payors' claims brought under \nthese laws must be dismissed because the operative complaint makes no non\u00ad\nconclusory allegations that commerce within these four states was affected by \nDefendants' anticompetitive conduct. D.I. 140 at 13. The complaint, however, \nidentifies the four states, D.I. 136 ,r 257, and alleges that brand and generic \nSeroquel XR\u00ae were \"shipped into each state and [were] sold to or paid for by [the] \nEnd-Payors,\" D.I. 136 ,r 218; that \"in connection with the purchase and sale of \nbranded Seroquel XR[\u00ae], money exchanged hands and business communications \nand transactions occurred in each state,\" D.I. 136 ,r 219; and that \"retailers within \n54 each state were foreclosed from offering cheaper Seroquel XR[\u00ae] and generic \nextended-release quetiapine fumarate to the End-Payors purchasing inside each \nrespective state,\" D.I. 136 ,r 220. See also D.I. 136 ,r,r 33, 37 (alleging conduct in \nNew York and Tennessee). These allegations are sufficient to plausibly imply \nintra-state commerce effects in New York, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. \n2. Consumer Protection Claims \nThe End-Payors bring claims under the consumer protection statutes of 15 \nstates. D.I. 136 ,r,r 277-82. Defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that the \nclaims are inadequately pleaded and that the alleged conduct is not actionable \nunder the requirements of the laws of Illinois, New York, Minnesota, Missouri, \nNevada, and North Carolina. \na. Adequacy of Pleadings \nDefendants argue that the End-Payors' allegations of state consumer \nprotection law violations are inadequately pleaded because the End-Payors rely on \nthe same factual allegations as they do for their alleged antitrust violations, only \nprovide conclusory recitations of the elements of consumer protection violations, \nand list relevant state statutes without explaining their applicability. D.I. 140 at 14. \nBut Defendants do not explain why the alleged facts are inadequate to \nsupport consumer protection claims under the laws of all the relevant states. If the \nEnd-Payors failed to plead required elements of the claims, Defendants were free \n55 to point out those deficiencies-and indeed they did so for certain states. \nDefendants' suggestion that the End-Payors must list the elements of every \nasserted state consumer protection statute and connect the pleaded facts to those \nelements goes too far. See Generic Pharms., 368 F. Supp. 3d at 840 (\"[Plaintiffs] \nneed not reiterate these facts [ supporting federal antitrust claims] in their consumer \nprotection law counts.\" (footnote omitted)). But see Avenarius v. Eaton Corp., 898 \nF. Supp. 2d 729, 739 (D. Del. 2012) (dismissing a \"formulaic recitation\" of \nconsumer protection complaints that \"do not clearly relate back\" to more detailed \nsupporting allegations). Here, the operative complaint alleges anticompetitive \nconduct that plausibly deprived consumers of the benefits of competition. D.I. 136 \n,r,r 108, 166-67, 174-75, 199-200. And it provides the relevant statute for each \nstate consumer protection claim. D.I. 136 ,r 278. Barring a specific deficiency \nraised by Defendants, these allegations are sufficient to state claims for unfair \ncompetition. I turn then to the specific deficiencies identified by Defendants. \nb. State-Specific Requirements \n1) Illinois \nDefendants argue that \"[i]nsofar\" as the End-Payors cannot bring an antitrust \nclaim under the Illinois Antitrust Act, they cannot bring antitrust claims under the \nIllinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (ICFDBP A), 815 \nIll. Comp. Stat. 510, as an end-run to that prohibition. See D.I. 140 at 15-16; D.I. \n56 155 at 8. As I have already found that the End-Payors can bring their claims under \nthe Illinois Antitrust Act, this argument fails, and I will allow the End-Payors' \nICFDBP A claims to move forward. \n2) NewYork \nDefendants argue that New York's consumer protection law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. \n\u00a7 349, requires plaintiffs to allege deception directed towards consumers and that \nthe End-Payors have not alleged any such deception. D.I. 140 at 16. The End\u00ad\nPayors respond that they have adequately pleaded deception \"by alleging that \nDefendants engaged in anticompetitive conduct\" to inflate prices. D.I. 150 at 16. \nFederal courts are split as to what facts are sufficient to plead deception under New \nYork law. Compare E.ffexor, 337 F. Supp. 3d at 466 (holding that \"prevent[ing] \nthe earlier market entry of [a] generic [drug]\" and \"caus[ing] individuals to pay a \npremium\" is sufficient to sustain a claim under New York's consumer protection \nlaw), with In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 812 F. Supp. 2d 390, 410 (S.D.N.Y. \n2011) ( dismissing \"antitrust allegations that were [not] imbued with a degree of \nsubterfuge\" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). New York's statute is \nmodeled on the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), and the federal \n\"government may use the FTC Act to enforce antitrust laws.\" New York v. \nFeldman, 210 F. Supp. 2d 294,302 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (citing Times-Picayune Pub. \nCo. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 609 (1953)). But New York's statute \"does not \n57 include the FTC Act's prohibition on unfair methods of competition and unfair acts \nand practices.\" In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig., 350 F. \nSupp. 2d 160, 197 (D. Me. 2004) (citing N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law\u00a7 349(a) and 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(l)). \nHere, the End-Payors have not explained what makes the alleged unlawful \nagreements deceptive as required by New York Law. See Blue Cross & Blue \nShield of N.J., Inc. v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 3 N.Y.3d 200, 205-06 (2004) (\"In \norder to make out a valid [New York consumer protection] claim, a plaintiff must \nallege both a deceptive act or practice directed toward consumers and that such act \nor practice resulted in actual injury to a plaintiff.\" ( citations omitted)); see also \nCity of New Yorkv. Smokes-Spirits.Com, Inc., 12 N.Y.3d 616,623 (2009) \n(\"[P]laintiffs must also plead that they have suffered actual injury caused by a \nmaterially misleading or deceptive act or practice.\" ( citations omitted)); N. State \nAutobahn, Inc. v. Progressive Ins. Grp. Co., 102 A.D.3d 5, 13 (N.Y. App. Div. \n2012) (\"[T]he deception itself is the harm that the statute seeks to remedy .... \" \n( citations omitted)). The End-Payors allege anticompetitive conduct, see, e.g., D.I. \n136 ,I,I 25, 32, 179, but not deceptive conduct, save in conclusory allegations \nattached to their deceptive trade practices count, see D.I. 136 ,I,I 278-79. I am \nconvinced by the reasoning of the New Motor Vehicles court that the End-Payors \nmust plead conduct that is both anticompetitive and deceptive to make out a case \n58 under New York's consumer protection law. Accordingly, because the End-Payors \nhave not alleged facts that suggest consumer deception, I will dismiss their claims \nbrought under New York's consumer protection law. \n3) Minnesota \nMinnesota's Consumer Fraud Act also requires deception. Minn. Stat. Ann. \n\u00a7 325F.69; Grp. Health Plan, Inc. v. Philip Morris Inc., 621 N.W.2d 2, 12 (Minn. \n2001) (\"Minnesota Statutes\u00a7 325F.69, subdivision 1, defines the conduct \nproscribed essentially as any misrepresentation made with the intent that others \nrely on it in connection with the sale of any merchandise.\"); Ly v. Nystrom, 615 \nN.W.2d 302, 310 (Minn. 2000) ( explaining that under the MCF A, \"fraudulent \nconduct must not have been committed in a vacuum-it must have been intended to \ndeceive someone\"); Alsides v. Brown Inst., Ltd., 592 N.W.2d 468,474 (Minn. Ct. \nApp. 1999) (\"[A] [consumer fraud] plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant \nmade a false promise or misrepresentation with the intent that others rely \nthereon .... \"); Arrowhead Bluffs, Inc. v. Blackburn, 2003 WL 22778336, at *2 \n(Minn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2003) ( citing Alsides, 592 N.W.2d at 474). Defendants \nargue that the End-Payors fail to plead factual allegations of \"fraud\" or \n\"deception.\" D.I. 140 at 16-17. The End-Payors respond only with reference to \ntheir arguments under the New York consumer protection law. D .I. 15 0 at 17. \n59 Since, as discussed above, the End-Payors have not alleged facts suggesting any \nintent to deceive, I will dismiss their Minnesota consumer protection claim. \n4) Missouri \nThe Missouri consumer protection law only provides a private cause of \naction for purchases made primarily for \"personal, family, or household purposes.\" \nMo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 407.025; Hess v. Chase Manhattan Bank, USA, NA., 220 S.W.3d \n758, 773-74 (Mo. 2007) (en bane) (citing Mo. Stat.\u00a7 407.025) (explaining that a \npurchase \"primarily for personal, family or household purposes\" is a required \nelement of a claim under Section 407); Cupit v. Dry Basement, Inc., 592 S.W.3d \n417, 423 (Mo. Ct. App. 2020) (\"To plead a violation of the [Missouri \nMerchandising Practices Act], the plaintiff must plead that he or she (1) purchased \nmerchandise ... from the defendant, (2) for personal, family, or household \npurposes .... \" ( citation omitted)). \nDefendants argue that I must dismiss the End-Payors' Missouri claims \n\"[b]ecause [the End-Payors] made no purchases for personal, family, or household \npurposes .... \" D.I. 140 at 18. The End-Payors respond only with the non sequitur \nthat their \"class includes individual consumers as well as end-payors, who \nparticipate in consumer transactions .... \" D.I. 150 at 18. Their failure to identify \nany allegation in the operative complaints that a putative member of the End\u00ad\nPayors' class made purchases for \"personal, family, or household purposes\" dooms \n60 their Missouri claims. For that reason, I will dismiss the End-Payors' claims \nbrought under the Missouri consumer protection law. \n5) Nevada \nPlaintiffs assert claims under the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act \n(NDTPA). D.I. 136 ,I 278(i) (citing Nev. Rev. Stat.\u00a7 598.0903-993). Chapter 41 \nof Title 3 of that Act provides that \"any person\" who is a victim of \"consumer \nfraud\" may bring an action and includes the conduct prohibited by the NDTP A \nwithin the scope of\"consumer fraud.\" Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann.\u00a7\u00a7 41.600(1), (2)(e). \nDefendants argued for the first time in their reply brief that \"any person\" is limited \nto natural persons. D.I. 155 at 10. The argument is therefore waived for the \npurposes of the pending motion. See In re Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium) Prods. \nLiab. Litig (No. II), 751 F.3d 150, 157 (3d Cir. 2014) (\"We have consistently held \nthat [ a ]n issue is waived unless a party raises it in its opening brief .... \" ( first \nalteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). \n6) North Carolina \nDefendants argue that the End-Payors do not allege \"a substantial effect\" on \nintrastate commerce as required by North Carolina's consumer protection law. \nD.I. 140 at 18. But for the reasons discussed above, see infra at Section \nIII(B)(l)(c), the operative complaint alleges that Defendants' conduct had \nsignificant in-state effects in each of the states identified in the complaint. That \n61 allegation is sufficient for the North Carolina claim to proceed at this stage of the \ncase. See Am. Rockwool, Inc. v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 640 F. Supp. \n1411, 1427 (E.D.N.C. 1986) (relying in part on plaintiffs presence in North \nCarolina to exercise jurisdiction under North Carolina's consumer protection law); \nHometown Pub., LLC v. Kidsville NewsA, Inc., 2014 WL 7499450, at *5 (E.D.N.C. \nOct. 3, 2014) ( quoting American Rockwool). \n3. Unjust Enrichment Claims \nDefendants argue that (1) all the End-Payors' unjust enrichment claims are \ninadequately pleaded and therefore should be dismissed, D.I. 140 at 19; (2) the \nunjust enrichment claims brought under the laws of states that follow Illinois Brick \nshould be dismissed \"as such claims contravene th[ ose] states' express policy \ndecisions,\" D.I. 140 at 18; (3) the unjust enrichment claims brought under the laws \nof the states that allow for indirect purchaser antitrust claims should be dismissed \nas \"duplicative,\" D.I. 140 at 21; and (4) the End-Payors' unjust enrichment claims \nasserted under Georgia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia laws should \nbe dismissed for state-specific reasons, D.I. 140 at 21-22. \na. Adequacy of Pleadings \nDefendants argue that the End-Payors' claims for unjust enrichment are \ninadequately pleaded, because they incorporate the rest of the allegations in the \n62 operative complaint and neither provide the relevant law nor connect the pleaded \nfacts to that law. D .I. 140 at 19. \nTo state an unjust enrichment claim in most states, a plaintiff must allege \nthat the defendant received a benefit at the plaintiffs expense under circumstances \nthat would make it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying for \nit where there is not an adequate remedy at law. See 66 Am. Jur. 2d Restitution \nand Implied Contracts\u00a7 11 (2021); Restatement (First) of Restitution\u00a7 1 (1937). \nHere, the End-Payors allege that they paid for brand and generic Seroquel XR\u00ae at \nsupracompetitive prices. D.I. 136 ilil 203-206, 286-287; D.I. 150 at 18-19. In \nother words, Defendants received excess profits at the End-Pay ors' expense on \naccount of Defendants' alleged anticompetitive conduct. These facts are sufficient \nto plausibly state prima facie unjust enrichment claims. \nb. Claims under Laws of States that Follow Illinois Brick \nDefendants argue that the End-Payors \"cannot sidestep Illinois Brick's \nprohibition on indirect-purchaser suits by bringing unjust enrichment claims in \nstates that explicitly disallow indirect purchasers from pursuing antitrust and \nconsumer protection claims.\" D.I. 140 at 19 (internal citation, alterations, and \nquotation marks omitted). I agree. As another district court in this circuit \nexplained, \"the vast majority of courts have held that indirect purchasers may not \nbring state claims for unjust enrichment if they otherwise would be barred from \n63 bringing a claim under that state's antitrust and consumer-protection statutes, \nabsent a showing that the common law of the state in question expressly allows for \nsuch recovery .... [A]llowing ... [such] unjust enrichment claims ... would \nresult in circumvention of the policies expressed by state legislatures through \nlimitations inherent in those laws.\" Niaspan, 42 F. Supp. 3d at 763; see In re \nNovartis & Par Antitrust Litig., 2019 WL 3841711, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, \n2019) ( quoting Niaspan ); In re Packaged Seafood Prod. Antitrust Litig., 242 F. \nSupp. 3d 1033, 1088-89 (S.D. Cal. 2017) (\"[T]he vast majority of courts rightly \nhold that unjust enrichment may not supply a valid cause of action in states where \nplaintiffs are otherwise barred from recovery under relevant antitrust and consumer \nprotection statutes. This makes sense. The crux of a plaintiffs claim will be the \nsame, and, after all, unjust enrichment is an equitable remedy, and it would be \ninequitable to permit relief where the state has clearly made a policy determination \nthat no such relief should lie.\" ( citations omitted)); In re Lidoderm Antitrust Litig., \n103 F. Supp. 3d 1155, 1175 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (\"[Plaintiff] cannot make an 'end \nrun' around Illinois Brick by relying on [plaintiffs] unjust enrichment claim for \nstates that have not enacted an Illinois Brick repealer statute .... \"); In re DDA VP \nIndirect Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 903 F. Supp. 2d 198, 232 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) \n(similar). \n64 Accordingly, I will dismiss the unjust enrichment claims in states that have \nnot repealed the Illinois Brick rule (i.e., Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nAlabama, Georgia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania). D.I. 140 at 20. \nc. Unjust Enrichment Claims in States with an Adequate \nStatutory Remedy \nThe End-Payors plead their unjust enrichment claims \"in the alternative to \n[their] other claims .... \" D.I. 136 ,r 284. Defendants argue that I should dismiss \nthe End-Payors' unjust enrichment claims as duplicative of their state-law antitrust \nand consumer protection claims because the unjust enrichment claims will only \nsucceed where those statutory claims succeed. D.I. 140 at 21 (citing Novartis & \nPar, 2019 WL 3841711, at *7 (\"I nevertheless conclude that plaintiffs' unjust \nenrichment claims are unnecessary and duplicative of their statutory claims .... \nDismissing these claims serves an important function in streamlining the litigation \nproceedings of a complex case.\")). But if the unjust enrichment claims prove to be \nduplicative, the End-Payors will have an adequate remedy at law and, presumably, \nwill not be able to recover for unjust enrichment. The End-Payors pleaded these \nclaims in the alternative, as permitted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n8( d)(2), and Defendants have not explained why the relevant state laws render \nthese claims duplicative. \n65 d. State-Specific Requirements \n1) Georgia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania \nDefendants argue that Georgia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania do not permit \nunjust enrichment claims by indirect purchasers. D .I. 140 at 21. Since I will \ndismiss the unjust enrichment claims in these states for the reasons stated above, \nsee supra at Section III(B)(3)(b ), I need not consider Defendants' state-specific \narguments. \n2) West Virginia \nWest Virginia state law bars unjust enrichment claims on !aches grounds if \nthere is \"a delay in the assertion of a known right which works to the disadvantage \nof another.\" Dunn v. Rockwell, 689 S.E.2d 255,267 n.11 (W. Va. 2009) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted). Defendants argue that the End-Payors \ndelayed in asserting \"a known right for nearly a decade.\" D.I. 140 at 22 (internal \nquotation marks and alterations omitted). But, because Defendants have not \nexplained why the alleged delay prejudiced them, I will not dismiss the West \nVirginia unjust enrichment claims based on !aches. See Dunn, 689 S.E.2d at 267 \nn.11 ( explaining that the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia \"has \nconsistently emphasized the necessity of a showing that there has been a \ndetrimental change of position in order to prove laches\" ( citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted));Hess v. Radford, 2011 WL 8193594, at *1 (W. Va. \n66 Dec. 2, 2011) (\"Laches is a delay in the assertion of a known right which works to \nthe disadvantage of another .... \" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); \nShuffv. Bank of Am., 2021 WL 219105, at *4 (S.D.W. Va. Jan. 21, 2021) (citing \nand quoting Dunn). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I will grant in part and deny in part the pending \nmotions to dismiss. I will dismiss: \n\u2022 Plaintiffs' claims in all the operative complaints to the extent they are \nbased on the Accord/ AstraZeneca agreement. \n\u2022 Counts I, II, and III of the End-Payors' Second Consolidated \nAmended Complaint to the extent they include claims brought under \nUtah or Maryland law, except for the claims brought by the Mayor \nand City Council of Baltimore and any other unnamed political \nsubdivisions of Maryland that may be in the proposed class. \n\u2022 Counts III and IV of the End-Payors' Second Consolidated Amended \nComplaint to the extent they include claims brought under \nMassachusetts law. \n\u2022 Count IV of the End-Payors' Second Consolidated Amended \nComplaint to the extent it includes claims brought under New York, \nMinnesota, or Missouri law. \n67 \u2022 Count V of the End-Payors' Second Consolidated Amended \nComplaint to the extent it includes claims brought under Florida, \nIllinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, or \nPennsylvania law. \nI will deny the motions to dismiss in all other respects.12 \nThe Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n12 Defendants also argue in their briefing that \"[i]f this case is to proceed past Rule \nl 2(b )( 6), the per se allegations should be dismissed, and rule of reason \napplied.\" D.I. 138 at 21. As an initial matter, Plaintiffs do not bring any per se \nantitrust claim, so there is no claim to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). With regards \nto the ''per se allegations\" made in the operative complaints, \"[p]er se and rule-of\u00ad\nreason analysis are but two methods of determining whether a restraint is \n'unreasonable,' i.e., whether its anticompetitive effects outweigh its \nprocompetitive effects.\" Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, \n342 (1990) (footnote omitted); see Eichorn v. AT & T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 138 (3d \nCir. 2001), as amended (June 12, 2001) (\"Once there is the finding of antitrust \ninjury, courts examine the alleged illegal conduct under one of two distinct tests: \nper se violation or rule of reason.\"). The Third Circuit has explained that \"[t]he \nFederal Rules do not require a plaintiff to set out a legal theory at the pleadings \nstage, and courts have upheld a complaint against a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss even though the plaintiff appeared to rely on an inappropriate \ntheory.\" Andrews v. Monroe Cnty. Transit Auth., 523 F. App'x 889, 891 (3d Cir. \n2013) (citations omitted). Thus, even ifDefendants are correct that Plaintiffs are \nattempting to invoke improperly an antitrust theory, I need not address this \npotential error now. See Bartholet v. Reishauer A.G. (Zurich), 953 F.2d 1073, \n1078 (7th Cir. 1992) (\"[A] complaint need not identify a legal theory, and \nspecifying an incorrect theory is not fatal.\"). \n68 "}
