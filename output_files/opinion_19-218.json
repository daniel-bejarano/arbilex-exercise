July 28, 2022 Wilmington, Delaware1 \nNOREIKA, U.S. District Judge : \n  \nPlaintiff George Lamplugh ( \u201cPlaintiff\u201d ), who appears pro se  filed this action on \nFebruary  1, 2019.  (D.I. 2).  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 by reason \nof diversity of the parties.  The matter proceeds against Defendant s PBF Energy d/b/a Delaware \nCity Refining Company LLC  (\u201cDCRC\u201d)  and Brian Miller (\u201cMiller\u201d).   Before the C ourt is \nDefendant s\u2019 motion  for summary judgment .  (D.I. 48).  Plaintiff opposes.  The matter has been \nfully briefed.    \nI.   BACKGROUND \n A. Allegations \nThe original Complaint (D.I. 2) , together with the Amended and Supplemental Pleadings \n(D.I. 15) , comprise the operative pleading.  Plaintiff alleges that he applied for employment as a \nrefinery operator with  DCRC, accepted an offer of employment on January 13, 2016, and was \nscheduled to begin work on February 16, 2016.  (D.I. 2 at  6).  On February 10, 2016, Plaintiff  \nwas informed by DCRC human resources that DCRC  was rescinding its employment offer \u201cbased \non information brought to the attention of human resources from a former supervisor.\u201d   (Id.).  \nThe identity of the supervisor was not disclosed, but Plaintiff believes the information was  \nprovided by Miller  a current DCRC employee, who supervised Plaintiff  when they were both \nemployed at Sunoco Company, Inc. (\u201cSunoco\u201d) .  (Id.).  Plaintiff alleges that Miller was \ninvolved in the terminati on of Plaintiff\u2019s employment with Sunoco and was also the main witness  \nduring the arbitration proceedings that followed .  (Id.).  Two claims survive f ollowing motions \nto dismiss filed by Defendants: Claim 4, promissory estoppel against DCRC and Claim 7, sl ander \nand libel against Miller.  2 B. Facts Presented by Defendants1 \nPlaintiff  was employed by Sunoco as a refinery operator in the ethylene  complex unit.  \n(D.I. 51 at 8- 9, 18-19).   At the same time Plaintiff was employed by Sunoco, Miller was employed \nthere as an area superintendent for the ethylene complex , and he supervised shift supervisors who  \ndirectly supervised P laintiff.   (Id. at 18-19).   Plaintiff was terminated from Sunoco f or sending \nan email to Miller which  contained the phrase \u201cGFY\u201d ( i.e., go fuck yourself ) and for attend ing the \nOrange Bowl  when he was allegedly under a doctor\u2019s care and unable to work.  ( Id. at 24 -34).  \nPlaintiff\u2019s union filed a grievance on his behalf protesting his  termination, claiming unjust \ntermination.   (Id. at 25).  An arbitration hearing was held in November 2006, and the a rbitration  \nopinion and a ward , issued March 1, 2007, denied  Plaintiff\u2019s grievance and f ound \u201cthere was  just \ncause for t he discharge.\u201d   (Id. at 34). \nAt some point after he was no longer employed by Sunoco, Plaintiff purchased ten arcade \ngame machines and stored the m at Ice Works.   (Id. at 15).   Plaintiff paid a monthly  rental  fee to \nIce Works for his arcade game machines and  estimated the business generated monthly revenue of \n$800.00.  ( Id.).  Plaintiff also testified that  after he was terminated from Sunoco he intended to \nstart a flounder fishing business in Ocean City, Maryl and.  (Id.).  He created an LLC and  \nplanned to rent a boat slip to store his boat and charge people to take them flounder fishing on his \nboat.  ( Id. at 15-16 ). \nIn late 2015, Plaintiff applied for the position of refinery operator with DCRC. ( D.I. 2 at \n6).  Plaintiff took a written mechanical abilities test and had  an in -person interview. ( D.I. 51 at \n6).  During the interview, Plaintiff discussed his termination f rom Sunoco.  ( Id. at 6 -7).  He \n \n1   Plaintiff\u2019s opposition contains argument and case law, but does not cite to any facts in the \nrecord and did not attach any exhibits to support his position other than a medical record . 3 testified that this was the  only time that he discussed his termination with anyone at DCRC.  (Id. \nat 6, 10).   Plaintiff told the interviewers that he was terminated after sending an  email to M iller \nwith G FY in it.  (Id. at 7).  He testified that he went into great detail about what happened vis a \nvis his termination  and told them that he had lost an arbitration, but c ould not recall if he told  the \ninterviewers that he also had been  terminated for abuse of sick leave and FMLA leave.   (Id.).  \nDCRC human resources manager Barbara Roehl (\u201cRoehl \u201d) stated that she interviewed Plaintiff \nand recalled only that Plaintiff stated his termination from Sunoco was because he was \u201can \nimmature 30 -year old\u201d  and that  and he did not state t hat he was terminated because of the GFY \ncomment or because of abuse of sick leave or FMLA leave.   (Id. at 10).  \nFollowing the  interview, P laintiff received a congratulatory phone call from DCRC telling \nhim he ha d gotten the job.  (Id. at 8, 9).   On January  13, 2016, DCRC extended Plaintiff an offer \nof employment by letter  with a start date of  February 16, 2016.  (Id. at 8, 9, 46).   Plaintiff \naccepted the offer and , on January 16, 2016, human resources supervisor Cynthia L. Parker sent \nPlaintiff a letter with  several documents including DCRC\u2019s new hire packet.   (Id. at 48).   \nPlaintiff testified that when he received the offer from DCRC, he \u201c decided to focus one hundred \npercent on  DCRC.  So [he] got rid of any other prospective advantages that [he] may have had  \n. . . going in to concentrate strictly on DCRC.\u201d   (Id. at 15).  Plaintiff told Ice Works to \u201cfind \nsomebody else.\u201d  (Id.).  \nIn February 2016 Miller learned that Plaintiff applied for a job position with DCRC.2  (Id. \nat 18 -19).  At the time, Miller  \u201cwas employed  as a technical manager  for Paulsboro Refining \nCompany LLC (\u201cPRC\u201d).\u201d   (Id. at 18).  PRC and DCRC are affiliated corporations that have \ncommon ownership and some overlap of corporate services.\u201d  (Id.).  Plaintiff  testified that when \n \n2    Miller is the current operations manager for DCRC. 4 he was interviewed for the DCRC position he did not know whether PRC and DCRC were  \naffiliated or related in any way.   (Id. at 14).   Miller provided a copy of the March 1, 2007 \nAmerican Arbitration Association  opinion and award to Roehl .  (Id. at 19, 50, 51).  Miller \n\u201csuggested that DCRC consider the information in the arbitration opinion prior to employing \nPlaintiff.\u201d  (Id. at 19).   Plaintiff  testified that he  does not \u201cknow exactly what was said between \n[Miller] and whoever he  contacted at DCRC\u201d when Miller provided the arbitration award and \nopinion.  (Id. at 13).  \nSometime between February 1, 2016 and February 10, 2016, Plaintiff received a call from \nRoehl  who informed Plaintiff that DCRC was withdrawing its  offer of employment.  (Id. at 10, \n11).  On February 10, 2016, Roehl sent Plaintiff a letter re garding DCRC\u2019s decision to rescind \nPlaintiff\u2019s offer of employment and explaining the reason the offer was rescinded.   (Id. at 10, 54).  \nThe letter stated  that after the offer of employment  had been extended to Plaintiff , human resources \nreceived information from supervisors at DCRC refineries who had work experience with Plaintiff \nand who were involved in the arbitration following Plaintiff\u2019s termination from the Sunoco Marcus \nHook Refinery.  ( Id. at 54).  The letter referred to the arbitrator \u2019s decision that was in favor of \nSunoco and that upheld the termination .  (Id.).  It also referenced that the terminatio n occurred \nin 2006 and that Plaintiff  had admitted to being an immature 30 -year old at the time .  (Id.).  The \nletter stated that after further reviewing the situation, DCRC felt  the circumstances leading to the \narbitrator\u2019s decision were serious enough to  rescind the job offer  and that the decision was  final.   \n(Id.).   Plaintiff  testified that he  knew that Roehl was referring to Miller in the  February 10, 2016 \nletter  when she used the word \u201csupervisor\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s only one\u201d person it could be .  (Id. at \n13).  Plaintiff explained that Miller was the only one he had worked at DCRC who  was involved 5 in his arbitration.   (Id. at 10).  Plaintiff told his friend Bob Martino  (\u201cMartino\u201d) that DCRC ha d \nrescinded the job offe r.  ( Id. at 12).   Martino told Plaintiff he was friends with Jim Fedena  \n(\u201cFedena\u201d) , a member of management  associated with DCRC , and he would call Fedena \u201cto try to \nfind out what happened.\u201d  (Id. at 11-12).   When Martino contacted  Fedena, he was told that  \nMiller gave the a rbitration opinion to DCRC.  (Id. at 11).   In turn, Martino informed Plaintiff \nthat Fedena told him that Miller gave the  arbitration opinion to DCRC.  (Id. at 12).   Plaintiff \ntestified that through these interactions between himself, Martino and Fedena, \u201cwe had found out \nthat it was actually Brian Miller  . . . that reached out to\u201d DCRC.   (Id. at 11).   After  Plaintiff \nreceived t he information from Martino, he emailed Fedena on February 18, 2016.  ( Id. at 12, 56-\n57). \nPlaintiff did not pursue the Ice Works business or flounder fishing business after the DCRC \nrescinded the job offer.  (Id. at 15-16).   He  did not return to Ice Works to see if he had been \nreplaced  and, between February and April of 2016, he decided not to start the flounder fishing \nbusiness and sold his boat sometime in April or May.  ( Id. at 16-17).   Plaintiff testified that he \nstarted a marina business in November 2020.  ( Id. at 16).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d   Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(a).  When determining whether a genuine issue of material f act exists, th is Court \nmust view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non- moving party and draw all reasonable \ninferences in that party\u2019s favor.   Scott v. Harris , 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Wishkin v. Potter , 476 \nF.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007).  A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only if the evidence is such that a reasonable \njury could return a verdict for the non- moving party, and a factual dispute is material when it 6 \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d   Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , 477 \nU.S. 242, 247- 49 (1986).  \nThe nonmoving party bears the burden to establish the existence of each element of his \ncase.   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  In doing so, the non- moving party \nmust present specific evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude in his  favor. \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248; Jones v. United Parcel Serv., 214 F.3d 402, 407 (3d Cir. 2000). \nSummary judgment should be granted if no reasonable trier of fact could find for the non- moving \nparty.  Radich v. G oode , 886 F.2d 1391, 1395 (3d Cir. 1989).    \n Plaintiff did not support his renewed motion when he failed to cite \u201c particular parts of \nmaterials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for the purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials,\u201d  or by \u201c showing that the materials cited do \nnot establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce \nadmissible evidence to support the fact \u201d as is required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B).  \u201c[T]he court is not obliged to scour the record to find \nevidence that will support a par ty\u2019s claims. \u201d  Perkins v. City of Elizabeth , 412 F. App\u2019 x 554, 555 \n(3d Cir. 2011); see also Holland v. New Jersey Dep \u2019t of Corr., 246 F.3d 267, 285 (3d Cir. 2001) \n(The court should not \u201c be required to scour the . . . records and transcripts, without specif ic \nguidance, in order to construct specific findings of fact \u201d to support its memorandum opinion and \norder.).   \nDefendants move for summary judgment on the grounds that  Plaintiff cannot establish the \nnecessary elements of a promissory estoppel claim and the libel/slander claim  is time -barred and \nfails as a matter of law.   7 III.  DISCUSSION  \n A. Promissory Estoppel \n Plaintiff alleges that DCRC offered him a position for employment; he accepted and \nsurrendered two business es relying on the hiring agreement; and DCRC retracted the offer entirely \nbased upon Miller\u2019s unsolicited bias ed information which intentionally and purposely interfered \nand led DCRC to breach the terms o f employment.  (D.I. 2 at 7).  \n To state a claim for promissory estoppel, a plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing \nevidence that: \u201c(i) a promise was made; (ii) it was the reasonable expectation of the promisor to \ninduce action or forbearance on the p art of the promisee; (iii) the promisee reasonably relied on \nthe promise and took action to his detriment; and (iv) such promise is binding because injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\u201d   Windsor I, LLC v. CWCapital Asset Mgmt . \nLLC, 238 A.3d 863, 876 (Del. 2020)  (quoting SIGA Techs, Inc. v. PharmAthene, Inc ., 67 A.3d \n330, 347-348 (Del. 2013)) .    \n Defendants argue that there is no record evidence that DCRC , upon its offer of \nemployment, had a reasonable expectation to induce Plaintiff\u2019s actions in surrender ing his two \nbusinesses and no injustice arose out of the facts and circumstances  of this case.  Conversely, \nPlaintiff argues that he has met all the required elements of promissory estoppel.  Issues of fact preclude summary judgment.  As to inducement, while there is no r ecord \nevidence of discussion among the parties of Plaintiff\u2019s business ventures  or that DCRC ha d \nknowledge of them , Plaintiff testified that once he received the offer of employment he told Ice \nWorks to find someone else.\n3  Plaintiff  also testified that when he was offered the position he \n \n3   The Court does not discuss inducement as it relates to the flounder  fishing venture since \nPlaintiff did not start the business.   8 decided to focus on it and rid himself of the vending business.  See e.g ., Mimm v. Vanguard \nDealer Services , LLC , C.A. No. 11-736- GMS, 2014 WL 718296, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 25, 2014) \n(fact questions regarding representation of employment made to Plaintiff who left his position and \nrelied upon the representation to his det riment).   \n As to injustice , because DCRC rescinded its job offer, Defendants argue that Plain tiff\u2019s \nlack of candor and/or completeness during the DCRC job interview regarding Sunoco\u2019s \nemployment termination due to abuse of time -off caused DCRC to make the reasonable, legitimate \nbusiness decision to rescind its employment offer.  Roehl states that t he topic of time -off never \narose during Plaintiff\u2019s interview, w hile Plaintiff testified that although he did not recall if the topic \ncame up , he went into great detail about his prior termination and disclosed that he had lost an \narbitration .  Thus, there  is a genuine fact as whether  discussion of abuse of time -off and abuse of \nfamily leave occurred during the interview.  Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the nonmoving party, a reasonable jury could find than an injustice occur red and that  \nPlaintiff\u2019s reliance on the job offer was reasonable  assuming the time -off/family leave issues were \ndiscussed during the interview .  Whether this occurred is a question for the jury.  See e.g ., Lord \nv. Peninsula United Methodist Homes, Inc ., C.A. No. 97C -10-0122001 WL 392237, at *4 (De l. \nSuper. Apr. 12, 2001).   \n Because there remain genuine issues of fact, this Court concludes summary judgment is \nnot appropriate on the issue of promissory estopped.  \n B. Libel/Slander  \n Plaintiff alleges tha t Miller provided DCRC an arbitration document  that Plaintiff  asserts \ncontains false or inaccurate information.   Plaintiff alleges the arbitration document refers to \nFMLA violations raised against him when he was employed by Sunoco, that Plaintiff later sued 9 Sunoco over the FMLA claim , and the m atter was settled.  (D.I. 15 at 1).   Defendants  seek \nsummary judgment on the grounds that the issue is time -barred and fails as a matter of law.  \n Defamation consists of the \u201ctwin torts\u201d of libel (written defamation) and slander (spoken \ndefamation).  \u201cDefamation is generally understood as \u2018a false publication calculated to bring one \ninto disrepute.\u2019\u201d  \u201cIn general, the scope of liability for slander is not as great as that for libel, and the pleading requirements for sl ander are more strict.\u201d  To state a claim for defamation, a plaintiff \nmust plead: (1) a defamatory communication; (2) publication; (3) reference to the plaintiff; (4) the third party\u2019s understanding of the communication\u2019 s defamatory character; and (5) inju ry.  Optical \nAir Data Sys., LLC v. L -3 Commc\u2019ns Corp., C.A. No. N17C05619EMDCCLD, 2019 WL 328429, \nat *7 (Del. Super. Jan. 23, 2019) (internal citations omitted).  \n Summary judgment is appropriate for several reasons.  At his  deposition Plaintiff testified \nthat defamation  claim  rests on two facts :  Miller is not directly involved and did not work at  \nDCRC when he passed on the arbitration agreement, and Miller passed on the arbitration \nagreement that P laintiff believes has inco rrect information.  (D.I. 51 at 13) .  Miller\u2019s affidavit \nstates that in February 2016, he was employed as a technical manager for Paulsboro Refining Company and that it and DCRC are affiliated corporation s that have common ownership and some \noverlap of cor porate services.   (D.I. 51 at 18).  Miller had supervised Plaintiff at Sunoco and \nwhen he  learned that DCRC was considering hiring Plaintiff,  he forwarded the DCRC human \nresources manager a copy of the arbitration decision regarding the termination of Pla intiff\u2019s  \nemployment with Sunoco.  ( Id. at 19).   \n First, the record evidence does not support a defamation claim.  Defamation relies on \nspecific statements.  Preston Hollow Capital LLC v. Nuveen LLC , C.A. No. CVN19C10107 \nMMJCCLD , 2020 WL 7365808, at *7 (Del . Super. Dec., 15, 2020).  Plaintiff does not know 10 exactly what Miller said or who he contacted at DCRC.  (D.I. 13 -14).  To the extent the claim \nrests upon the arbitration decision provided by Miller, it was written by Arbitrator Robert E. Light, \nnot Miller.   The claim does not contain the required elements of defamation.  \n Second, Defendants assert that Miller is protected  by the qualified common interest \nprivilege .  The qualified common interest privilege protects \u201ccommunication . . . between two \nparties who have a common interest for the protection of which the allegedly defamatory communications are made.\u201d  Bickling v. K ent Gen. Hosp., Inc ., 872 F. Supp. 1299, 1307 (D. Del. \n1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Discussions about the \u201ccharacter or qualifications of \nan employee or former employee made to any person who has a legitimate interest in the subject matter\u201d m ay fall within the scope of this privilege.  Id.  (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nPlaintiff\u2019s testimony that Miller did not work at DCRC when he forwarded the information to its human resources manager does not overcome the fact that at the time  Mille r worked at Paulsboro \nRefining and that it and DCRC have common ownership and some overlap of corporate services.  \nIt follows, therefore, that there is a shared common interest for the protection of the  allegedly \ndefamatory communication ; whether DCRC should employ Plaintiff in light of the reasons he was \ndischarged by Sunoco as set forth in the arbitration decision.  Miller is protected by q ualified  \ncommon interest privilege.  \n And third, the claims are barred by the absolute litigation privilege.  \u201cDelawar e adheres to \nthe common law rule of \u2018absolute privilege\u2019 that \u2018protects from actions for defamation statements of judges, parties, witnesses and attorneys offered in the course of judicial proceedings so long as the party claiming the privilege shows that the statements issued as part of a judicial proceeding \nwere relevant to a matter at issue in the case.\u2019\u201d  Trice v. Chapman, C.A. No. 12- 491-GMS, 2012 \nWL 3762872, at *6 (D. Del. Aug. 28, 2012)  (quoting Barker v. Huang, 610 A.2d 1341, 1349 (Del. 11 1992)); see also Koch v. Pechota, 744 F. App\u2019 x 105, 114 (3d Cir. 2018) ).  Statements made in the \ncontext of arbitration proceedings are privileged.  See Wright v. Pepsi Cola Co., 243 F. Sup. 2d \n117, 124 (D. Del. 2003). \n The evidence of record does not support Plai ntiff\u2019s defamation  claim against Miller.  \nTherefore, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this issue.4  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the C ourt will grant- in-part and deny -in-part Defendants\u2019 motion \nfor summary judgment.  (D.I. 48).   \n   An appropriate order will be entered.   \n \n \n4  The Court will not addres s whether the claim is time -barred as summar y judgment is \nappropriate on other grounds.  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nGEORGE LAMPLUGH,  \n \n   Plaintiff,  \n   v.
