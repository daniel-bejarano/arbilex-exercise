The Court has reviewed the parties' briefs and other submissions. (See, \ne.g., D.I. 13, 14, 17, 19) For the reasons explained below, the Court will deny Natera's motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nNatera filed its complaint in this case on October 6, 2020, alleging that Genosity has \ninfringed U.S. Patent No. 10,731,220 (the '\"220 patent\").1 (D.I. 1,r 1) The '220 patent claims \n\"methods for simultaneously amplifying multiple nucleic acid regions of interest in a single \nreaction volume using universal primers, gene specific primers and molecular barcode.\" (Id. \n,r 31) The complaint alleges that Genosity \"does not have freedom to operate its AsTra products \nfor minimal residual disease ('MRD') and personalized cancer monitoring \" and that the accused \nproducts \"use ArcherDX, Inc.'s ('Archer's') ctDNA chemistry and region-specific primers, \nwhich infringe the '220 patent.\" (Id. ,r 1) \nNatera has also sued Archer in a separate patent infringement action in this Court. \n(Natera, Inc. v. ArcherDX, Inc., C.A. No. 20-125) (the \"Archer action\") In the Archer action, \nNatera asserts five patents, including the '220 patent and U.S. Patent No. 10,538,814 (the '\"814 \npatent\"). (C.A. No. 20-125 D.I. 391 ,r 1) The '814 patent shares the same specification as \n1 The Court believes that Natera's reference to the patent-in-suit as \"United States Patent No. \n10,732,220\" is a typographical error. (See D.I. 1 Ex. 1; D.I. 9 Answer ,r 1 n.2) \n1 the '220 patent. (D.I. 9 Answer ,r 127, Counterclaims ,r 41) In connection with a motion for \njudgment on the pleadings in the Archer action (C.A. No. 20-125 D.I. 23), Archer challenged the \nsubject matter eligibility of the asserted patents under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Court denied that \nmotion, finding that \"the claims here, as represented by claim 1 of the '814 [patent], ... are \nmethod of preparation claims and therefore eligible for patenting. \" (C.A. No. 20-125 D.I. 63 at \n8) The Archer action remains pending in this Court. \nOn February 15, 2021, Genosity answered the complaint in this action and asserted 14 \naffirmative defenses and three counterclaims . (D.I. 9) At issue in the pending motion are the \ncounterclaim for a declaratory judgment ofunenforceability of the '220 patent due to inequitable \nconduct and the affirmative defenses of unclean hands , prosecution laches, and inequitable \nconduct. (See id. Answer ,r,r 95-138, Counterclaims ,r,r 33-52) Genosity alleges that Natera's \nExecutive Chairman, Dr. Rabinowitz , failed to disclose several litigation-related documents to \nthe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") during prosecution of the '220 patent. (See id. \nAnswer ,r,r 120-38, Counterclaims ,r,r 33-52) The affirmative defenses also include allegations \nthat Natera misused Archer's confidential information and obtained claims to cover methods \nNatera did not invent (see id. Answer ,r,r 95-117), and that Natera unreasonably delayed the \nprosecution of the claims of the '220 patent (see id. Answer ,r,r 118, 119). \nOn March 8, 2021, Natera filed the pending motion to dismiss and strike. (D.I. 12) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Motion to Dismiss \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires \nthe Court to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 \nF.3d 218,223 (3d Cir. 2004). \"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but \n2 whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\" In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThus, the Court may grant such a motion to dismiss only if, after \"accepting all well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, \nplaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nHowever, \"[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that 'raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint \nare true (even if doubtful in fact).\"' Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227,234 (3d Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible \n\"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009). At bottom, \"[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation \nthat discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\" of a plaintiffs claim. \nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter School Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \"bald assertions,\" Morse v. Lower Merion \nSch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \"unsupported \nconclusions and unwarranted inferences ,\" Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pa. Power & Light Co., \n113 F.3d 405, 417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \"self-evidently false,\" Nami v. Fauver, \n82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1996). \n3 B. Motion to Strike \n\"Rule 12(b)(6) does not offer a mechanism for dismissing an affirmative defense.\" \nWyeth Holdings Corp. v. Sandoz, Inc., 2012 WL 600715, at *4 (D. Del. Feb. 3, 2012). Instead, \n\"pursuant to Rule 12(f), the Court may strike from a pleading any insufficient defense.\" Id. \n(internal quotation marks omitted). A court should not strike a defense unless its insufficiency is \n\"'clearly apparent.\"' Fesnak& Assocs., LLP v. US. BankNat 'l Ass'n, 722 F. Supp. 2d 496,502 \n(D. Del. 2010) (quoting Cipollone v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 789 F.2d 181, 188 (3d Cir. 1986)). \nHowever, \"a court is not required to accept affirmative defenses that are mere bare bones \nconclusory allegations , and may strike such inadequatel y pleaded defenses.\" Sun Microsystems , \nInc. v. Versata Enters., Inc., 630 F. Supp. 2d 395, 408 (D. Del. 2009). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Inequitable Conduct \n(Genosity's Fourteenth Defense and Third Counterclaim) \nTo prevail on the merits of an inequitable conduct defense, \"the accused infringer must \nprove by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant knew of the reference , knew that it \nwas material, and made a deliberate decision to withhold it.\" Therasense , Inc. v. Becton, \nDickinson & Co., 649 F.3d 1276, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2011). With respect to materiality, the accused \ninfringer must show that but for an omission by the applicant, the PTO would not have issued the \npatent claim. See id. at 1291-92. Deceptive intent may be inferred from indirect and \ncircumstantial evidence. See id. at 1290. On the merits, \"to meet the clear and convincing \nevidence standard, the specific intent to deceive must be the single most reasonable inference \nable to be drawn from the evidence .\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). At the pleading \nstage, however, proof by clear and convincing evidence is not required. See Exergen Corp. v. \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 575 F.3d 1312, 1329 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Nonetheless, inequitable \n4 conduct must be pled with particularity , to satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 9(b ). See id. at 1328-29. Hence, a pleading of inequitable conduct must include \n\"sufficient allegations of underlying facts from which a court may reasonably infer\" both the \nknowledge of material information and the specific intent to deceive the PTO. See id. \nIn this case, Genosity alleges that Dr. Rabinowitz, the Executive Chairman of Natera, \nengaged in inequitable conduct during prosecution of the '220 patent by failing to disclose \nseveral litigation-related documents to the PTO.2 (See D.I. 9 Answer ,r,r 120-38, Counterclaims \n,r,r 33-52) Natera contends that Genosity 's pleading is insufficient because it fails to plausibly \nallege: (1) the withheld documents are material to the patentability of the '220 patent (see D.I. 13 \nat 8-13), and (2) Dr. Rabinowitz possessed the specific intent to deceive the PTO (see id. at 13-\n16). The Court disagrees, as explained below. \n1. Materiality \na. Materiality as related to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 \nNatera first contends that the Archer documents (including some lllumina documents and \nCareDx documents referenced therein) cannot be but-for material to the patentability of the '220 \npatent under Section 101 because the Court had considered these documents and denied Archer's \n2 The allegedly withheld documents include: (a) from the Archer action: (1) Archer's Answer \n(D.I. 14), (2) Archer's Answer to the First Amended Complaint (D.I. 21), (3) Archer's Opening \nBrief in Support of its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (D.I. 24), and ( 4) Archer's Reply \nBrief in Support of its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (D.I. 36) (collectively, the \"Archer \ndocuments\"); (b) in CareDX, Inc. v. Natera, Inc., C.A. No. 19-567 (D. Del.) (the \"CareDX \naction\"): (1) Natera's Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 19), (2) Natera's Objections \nto Report and Recommendations (D.I. 63), (3) Natera's Opening Brief in Support of Renewed \nMotion to Dismiss (D.1. 87), (4) Natera's Opening Brief in Support of Summary Judgment of \nInvalidity (D.I. 101), and (5) Natera's Statement re Motion for Summary Judgment of Invalidity \n(D.1. 102) (collectively , the \"CareDX documents \"); (c) in lllumina, Inc. v. Natera, Inc., C.A. No. \n18-1662 (N.D. Cal.) (the \"lllumina action\"): (1) Natera's Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 24), and (2) \nNatera's Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss (D.1. 35) (collectively , the \"fllumina \ndocuments\"). (See D.I. 9 Answer ,r,r 123, 128, 130, Counterclaims ,r,r 37, 42, 44) \n5 Rule 12(c) motion challenging the subject matter eligibility of the '814 patent, which claims \nmethods \"closely related\" to the '220 patent.3 (See D.I. 13 at 8-9; see also D.I. 9 Answer ,r,r 124, \n126, Counterclaims ,r,r 38, 40) The Court's denial of Archer's Rule 12(c) motion, however, is \nnot final and may be reviewed on appeal. See, e.g., CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic , Inc., 2021 \nWL 5024388, at *6-7 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 29, 2021) (finding that district court should have granted \ndefendant 's Rule 12(c) motion as to unpatentability and remanding for entry of judgment ofno \nliability). Hence, Natera's conclusion that \"this Court's holdings of patentable subject matter ... \npreclude but-for materiality of Archer's failed Rule12(c) motion papers,\" is premature.4 (See \nD.I. 19 at 2) \nb. Materiality as related to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 \nNatera's argument that the Archer documents cannot be relevant with respect to Section \n103 is also unavailing. Natera contends that the Archer documents are not material to the \npatentability of the '220 patent because the prior art references , which Archer relied on for the \ninvalidity theory disclosed in the Archer documents , had been cited to the PTO. (See D.I. 13 at \n10-11) However , as Genosity points out, it is the Archer documents, \"and not the individual \nprior art references , [that] form the basis for the 'but-for material' allegation .\" (D.I. 17 at 7) The \nArcher documents \"did not merely identify prior art references \" but also \"set forth that the prior \n3 Natera requests that the Court take judicial notice of the \"Excerpts of Oct. 2, 2020 Transcript , \nJudge's Opinion on 9/30/2020 Section 101 Hearing in Natera, Inc. v. ArcherDX Inc., Case No. \n1:20-CV-00125 (D. Del.).\" (D.I. 14 at 1) Genosity does not address this request but relies on \nthe same transcript in its brief. (See D.I. 17 at 6) The Court, thus, understands that Genosity \ndoes not object. \n4 The Court need not address the parties' disputes concerning the potential impact of claim \nconstruction on the materiality of the withheld documents under Section 101. (See D.I. 17 at 6-\n7; D.I. 19 at 3-4) \n6 art of Mir alone or Mir in a specific combination with Wang, Spertini, or Makarov, discloses all \nelements of the '814 patent claims.\" (D.I. 17 at 7; see also D.I. 9 Counterclaims~ 40) The \nCourt does not agree with Natera that the Archer documents contain \"nothing more than a \nconclusory allegation\" (D.I. 19 at 5); instead, at this stage of the proceedings, the Court is \npersuaded by Genosity that these documents may be found to plausibly provide an \"invalidity \nroadmap\" that is materially \"different from a collection of thousands of references dumped on a \npatent examiner\" (D.I . 17 at 8). Thus, Natera's disclosure to the PTO of the individual \nreferences cited in the Archer documents does not preclude a finding ( once this issue reaches the \nevidentiary stage) that the Archer documents are also material to patentability. \nNatera's reliance on Fiskars, Inc. v. Hunt Manufacturing Co., 221 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. \n2000), is misplaced . In Fiskars, the patentee cited a brochure for a prior art device to the \nexaminer, and the examiner did not consider it during prosecution. See id. at 1327. The \ndefendant nonetheless contended that the patentee should have further explained to the examiner \nthe relevance of the device itself. See id. The Federal Circuit rejected that contention, holding \ninstead that \"[a]n applicant can not be guilty of inequitable conduct if the reference was cited to \nthe examiner , whether or not it was a ground ofrejection by the examiner. \" Id. Fiskars does not \nbroadly hold, however, that once prior art references are cited to the examiner, patentability \ninformation involving the combination of those references can no longer be material. See, e.g., \nSemiconductor Energy Lab. Co. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 204 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2000) \n(\"A withheld reference may be highly material when it discloses a more complete combination \nofrelevant features, even if those features are before the patent examiner in other references.\"). \nThus, Fiskars does not compel a grant ofNatera 's motion. \n7 Natera also unpersuasively argues that the withheld documents are cumulative of the \ninformation that the PTO already had. (See D.I. 13 at 11-12; D.I. 19 at 5-6) The Court \ndisagrees, for essentially the same reasons justifying the Court's conclusion with respect to \nmateriality. Additionally, the fact that \"the examiner was aware of these other litigations and \nNatera had submitted documents from such litigations to the examiner\" does not necessarily lead \nto the conclusion that the information disclosed in the specific documents at issue here is \ncumulative of the information included in the documents that had been provided to the PTO. \n(See D.I. 19 at 5) \nc. Materiality as related to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 \nNatera next contends that Genosity has failed to plead but-for materiality with respect to \nSection 112. (See, e.g., D.I. 13 at 12) Genosity alleges that Dr. Rabinowitz failed to disclose the \nArcher documents, which set forth that the '814 patent - a patent that shares a specification with, \nand claims subject matter closely related to, the '220 patent (see D.I. 9 Answer ,r,r 124, 127, \nCounterclaims ,r,r 38, 41)-is invalid under Section 112.5 Genosity further alleges that \"[i]fthe \n[PTO] had been made aware of these documents setting forth arguments for invalidity under \n[Section 112] ... the '220 patent would not have issued.\" (Id. Answer ,r 133, Counterclaims ,r \n4 7) Based on these factual allegations, at this stage of this case, Genosity has plausibly pied that \nthe Archer documents are but-for material to the patentability of the '220 patent under Section \n112. \n5 For example, Genosity alleges that the Archer documents explain how the specification of \nthe '814 patent \"does not disclose (a) an embodiment corresponding to the claimed methods, (b) \nthat the named inventors were in possession of the alleged invention, or ( c) sufficient \ninformation to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice the claims.\" (D.I. 9 Answer \n,r 127, Counterclaims ,r 41) Genosity also alleges that \"the claims were not entitled to a priority \ndate earlier than the filing date\" because Natera's earlier-filed applications do not comply with \nthe requirements under Section 112. (See id. Answer ,r,r 84, 127, Counterclaims ,r 41) \n8 2. Intent To Deceive \nWith respect to Genosity 's allegations of deceptive intent, Natera argues that Genosity \nfails to plead \"specific factual allegations showing that a specific individual with knowledge of \nthe material information decided to deliberately withhold it from the relevant examiner. \" (D.I. \n13 at 14) (internal quotation marks omitted) Contrary to Natera's suggestion, Genosity is not \nrequired at the pleading stage to allege facts satisfying the \"high standard\" that deceptive intent \nis the \"single most reasonable inference .\" (See id. at 13) Instead, Genosity \"need only allege \nfacts from which the Court could reasonably infer that the patent applicant made a deliberate \ndecision to deceive the PTO.\" Wyeth, 2012 WL 600715, at *7. \nGenosity has met this obligation . It has plausibly alleged Dr. Rabinowitz 's intent to \ndeceive the PTO. For example, Genosity alleges that, \"as a named inventor on the patent in \ndispute and the Executive Chairman of Natera and someone active in Natera's management ,\" Dr. \nRabinowitz was aware ofNatera's ongoing litigations and knew of the arguments set forth in the \nwithheld documents while the '220 patent was still in prosecution before the PTO. (See D.I. 9 \nAnswer ,r,r 123, 128, 130, Counterclaims ,r,r 37, 42, 44) Genosity also alleges that Dr. \nRabinowitz knew \"he had a duty to disclose these documents to the [PTO],\" because other \ndocuments in the fllumina action pertaining to Section 101 were disclosed to the PTO during \nprosecution of the '220 patent. (See id. Answer ,r 13 7, Counterclaims ,r 51) Genosity further \nalleges that Dr. Rabinowitz , despite understanding that the withheld documents were material \nand must be disclosed to the PTO, failed to fulfill his duty of disclosure . (See id.) These alleged \nfacts are sufficient to support a .reasonable inference that Dr. Rabinowitz intentionall y withheld \nthe litigation documents at issue from the PTO during prosecution of the '220 patent, knowing \nthat they were material to the patentability. \n9 For the foregoing reasons, Genosity has plausibly alleged both the materiality of the \nwithheld documents and Dr. Rabinowitz's deceptive intent. Thus, the Court will deny Natera's \nmotion to dismiss the counterclaim for a declarato ry judgment of unenforceability due to \ninequitable conduct and to strike the affirmative defenses of inequitable conduct. \nB. Unclean Hands \n(Genosity's Twelfth Defense) \n\"[A] determination of unclean hands may be reached when misconduct of a party seeking \nrelief has immediate and necessary relation to the equity that he seeks in respect of the matter in \nlitigation.\" GileadScis. , Inc. v. Merck& Co., Inc., 888 F.3d 1231, 1239 (Fed. Cir. 2018) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to establish an unclean hands defense, a defendant \nmust show that \"(1) a party seeking affirmative relief (2) is guilty of conduct involving fraud, \ndeceit, unconscionability , or bad faith (3) directly related to the matter in issue (4) that injures the \nother party (5) and affects the balance of equities between the litigants. \" Sprint Commc 'ns Co. \nL.P. v. Charter Commc'ns, Inc., 2021 WL 982726, at *12 (D. Del. Mar. 16, 2021). \nGenosity alleges that Natera never claimed ArcherDX's method during \"protracted and \nconvoluted prosecution at the [PTO] spanning more than a decade\" and then drafted the claims \nof the '220 patent in an attempt to cover ArcherDX 's method, doing so \"only after one of its \nsenior executives left Natera, began working for ArcherDX , gained access to confidential \ninformation relating to ArcherDX 's technology and then returned to Natera.\" (D.I. 9 Answer ,r,r \n96, 114) A plausible inference can be drawn from these alleged facts that Natera misused \nArcherDX's confidential information to obtain claims that it did not invent and then asserted \nthese claims against Genosity . \nNatera's contention that it is not inequitable to draft patent claims to cover a competitor 's \nproducts (see D.I. 13 at 17; see also Kingsdown Med. Consultants , Ltd. v. Hollister Inc., 863 \n10 F.2d 867, 874 (Fed. Cir. 1988)), is not dispositive here. Even assuming Natera's contention is \ncorrect, Genosity's unclean hands defense is not predicated simply on this allegation alone. \nNatera's remaining criticisms of Genosity 's allegations, including that the unclean hands defense \nis based on merely \"conclusory allegations around Section 101 and 103\" (D .I. 13 at 18), do not \nprovide a meritorious basis for granting Natera's motion, for reasons including those given above \nin connection with assessing Natera's attacks on the inequitable conduct claims. \nC. Prosecution Laches \n(Genosity's Thirteenth Defense) \nProsecution !aches \"may render a patent unenforceable when it has issued only after an \nunreasonable and unexplained delay in prosecution that constitutes an egregious misuse of the \nstatutory patent system under the totality of the circumstances.\" Cancer Rsch. Tech. Ltd. v. Barr \nLabs., Inc., 625 F.3d 724, 728 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Natera \ncontends that Genosity 's affirmative defense of prosecution !aches \"simply pleads the legal \nconclusion of unreasonable delay or prejudice and does not plead any facts, other than simply \nciting the timeline of applications. \" (D.I. 13 at 19) The Court, however, agrees with Genosity \nthat its allegations that Natera delayed its prosecution of the claims of the '220 patent, and \n\"Natera has improperly sought to delay competition in the IVD market by pursuing patent claims \nit did not invent\" (see D.I. 9 Answer ,r,r 96, 111, 116), plausibly support an inference that \nNatera's prosecution delay is \"unreasonable and unexplained. \" (D.I. 17 at 12-13) Accordingly , \nthe Court will deny Natera's motion to strike the affirmative defense of prosecution laches. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiff's motion to dismiss and strike \n(D.I. 12).
