Andrews", "date": "07-15-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nACCELERATION BAY LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nTAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE , \nINC., ROCKSTAR GAMES, INC. and 2K \nSPORTS, INC., \nDefendants. C.A. No. 16-455-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is Defendants ' motion for attorneys ' fees and costs, estimated to be about nine \nmillion dollars. (D.I. 520). I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.1. 521, 524, 528). For \nthe reasons set forth below, Defendants ' motion (D.I. 520) is DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn its complaint, Plaintiff alleged that online features of three accused video games ( Grand \nTheft Auto Online (\"GTAO\"), NBA 2K15, and NBA 2K16) infringe six patents: U.S. Patent Nos. \n6,701,344 ('344 patent), 6,714,966 ('966 patent), 6,732,147 ('147 patent), 6,829,634 ('634 patent), \n6,910,069 ('069 patent), and 6,920,497 ('497 patent). (D.1. 1). Defendants disagreed and moved \nfor summary judgment of non-infringement on all asserted claims. (D.I. 462). After considering \nthe parties' arguments , I granted Defendants ' motion and ordered that judgment be entered in favor \nof Defendants . (D.I. 492, 495). Plaintiff appealed my judgment on multiple grounds. The \nFederal Circuit affirmed-in-part and dismissed-in-part on appeal. See Acceleration Bay LLC v. \n2K Sports, Inc., 15 F.4th 1069, 1079 (Fed. Cir. 2021). \n1 II. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nThe Patent Act provides, \"The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney \nfees to the prevailing party.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. Under the statute there are two basic \nrequirements: (1) that the case is \"exceptional\" and (2) that the party seeking fees is a \"prevailing \nparty.\" The Supreme Court defined an \"exceptional\" case as \"simply one that stands out from \nothers with respect to the substantive strength of a party's litigating position ( considering both the \ngoverning law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was \nlitigated.\" Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 545 (2014). \n\"District courts may determine whether a case is 'exceptional' in the case-by-case exercise of their \ndiscretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.\" Id. The Supreme Court has provided \na non-exclusive list of factors for district courts to consider in deciding whether a case is \nexceptional, including frivolousness, deterrence, motivation, and objective unreasonableness in \nthe factual and legal components of the suit. Id. at 554 n.6. A movant must establish its \nentitlement to attorneys' fees under\u00a7 285 by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. at 557-58. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 provides, \"Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any \ncourt of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case \nunreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, \nexpenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\" The Third Circuit \nlimits \u00a7 1927 fee awards to instances where an attorney has \"(1) multiplied proceedings ; (2) \nunreasonably and vexatiously; (3) thereby increasing the cost of the proceedings; ( 4) with bad faith \nor with intentional misconduct.\" LaSalle Nat'! Bankv. First Conn. Holding Grp., LLC., 287 F.3d \n279, 288 (3d Cir. 2002). \"[S]anctions may not be imposed under \u00a7 1927 absent a finding that \ncounsel's conduct resulted from bad faith, rather than misunderstanding , bad judgment , or well-\n2 intentioned zeal.\" Id. at 289. Further, \"\u00a7 1927 explicitly covers only the multiplication of \nproceedings that prolong the litigation of a case and likely not the initial pleading, as the \nproceedings in a case cannot be multiplied until there is a case.\" In re Schaefer Salt Recovery , \nInc., 542 F.3d 90, 101 (3d Cir. 2008) (emphasis in original). \nIII. DISCUSSI ON \nDefendants argue that this was an exceptional case warranting an award of attorneys ' fees \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 for two reasons: (1) Plaintiff's \"substantive litigation positions were \nexceptionally weak\" and (2) Plaintiff's \"litigation conduct was exceptional[ly ]\" unreasonable. \n(D.I. 521 at i). \nFirst, Defendants provide numerous examples of Plaintiff relying on \"exceptionally weak\" \narguments during this litigation . (Id. at 5-13). Defendants ' prime example is their assertion that \nPlaintiff relied on a modified screenshot from GTAO as falsified evidence supporting its \ninfringement theory for the \"m-regular \" limitation . (Id. at 5-8). Plaintiff's experts did not \nrecognize that certain modifications were made to this screenshot during their depositions. (See \nid. at 7-8 (citing D.I. 464, Ex. E-5 at 56:23-57:8, 65:7-14, Ex. E-6 at 36:24-37:1 , 132:24-133:9)). \nAll things considered , I am not convinced that Plaintiff or its experts intentionally relied on a \nfalsified screenshot , particularly given that Defendants ' experts noted in their reports that these \nimages were otherwise \"modified .\" (D.I. 464, Ex. A-1 at 1173, Ex. A-2 at 1129; see also D.I. 524 \nat 2-7, 5 (Plaintiff arguing that, \"Even Take Two's counsel acknowledged the understanding that \nthe [modified GTAO] image was only intended to illustrate concepts and was not offered as \nevidence of infringement during the experts' depositions. \")). \nBesides the accusation of relying upon falsified evidence, Defendants argue that in many \nadditional instances Plaintiff's arguments were exceptionally weak. (D.I. 521 at 5-13). These \n3 instances include: Plaintiff's infringement theories for the \"m-regular\" limitation, none of which \nmade it past summary judgment (id. at 5-9) (arguing that, in addition to the use of falsified \nevidence, Plaintiff's infringement theories for the \"m-regular\" limitation were \"baseless\"); \nPlaintiff's arguments regarding the eligibility of asserted computer readable medium claims under \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, where, after an unfavorable claim construction ruling, Plaintiff was unwilling to \nstipulate to ineligibility and instead pressed forward only to lose at summary judgment (id. at 9-\n1 O); Plaintiffs infringement accusations against games operating on the Sony Play Station platform \nthat were dismissed for a lack of standing (id. at 10-11; see Acceleration Bay LLC v. Activision \nBlizzard, Inc., No. 1 :16-cv-00453-RGA, 2017 WL 3668597 (D. Del. Aug. 24, 2017)); and \nPlaintiff's damages theories which were excluded in a related case (D.I. 521 at 11-13). I agree \nthat Plaintiff lost on several issues with objectively weak arguments , which ultimately led to my \ngranting summary judgment. Yet, I do not find that Plaintiff's arguments stand out as \nexceptionally weak; instead, it is often the case in complex litigation that zealous advocates will \nlose on multiple issues. (See D.I. 524 at 7-14 (Plaintiff explaining why their arguments were not \nunreasonable)). \nSecond, Defendants argue that the impropriety of Plaintiff's litigation conduct-including \nthe lack of candor, forcing relitigation of lost issues, and the pattern of inappropriate conduct in \nprevious cases-further proves that this case was exceptional. (See D.I. 521 at 13-15). \nRegarding the lack of candor, I stated in an earlier Order in a related case that I was \"concerned \nthat Plaintiff's national counsel cannot be relied upon for 'candor to the tribunal'\" based on \nincidents that occurred during discovery and claim construction. Acceleration Bay LLC v. \nActivision Blizzard, Inc., No. l:16-cv-00453-RGA , D.I. 422 (D. Del. Jan. 17, 2018) (denying \nDefendants ' request to strike untimely expert reports). I do not agree, however, that this proves \n4 that this case was exceptional. As to forcing relitigation of lost issues, Defendants list several \ninstances in which they feel this was the case. (See D.I. 521 at 13-14). I again disagree that these \ninstances stand out from other cases I have seen. \nRegarding Plaintiff's pattern of misconduct , Defendants reference multiple instances \nwhere courts have reprimanded Plaintiff's attorneys for inappropriate conduct. (Id at 14-15 \n(citing Freshub, Inc. v. Amazon.com Inc., No. 6:21-cv-00511-ADA , 2021 WL 5987106, at *6 \n(W.D. Tex. Dec. 17, 2021) (pending appeal in Fed. Cir. Case No. 22-1425) (\"[A] bitter losing \nparty's difficulty in explaining its loss is never a proper basis for counsel to invoke baseless \nallegations ofracism and anti-Semitism to request a new trial. Such vitriolic and unsubstantiated \nallegations are not only shocking, but also offensive to this Court. . .. By making such baseless \nallegations , Freshub's counsel has breached their duty to the Court.\"); Finjan, Inc. v. Juniper \nNetworks , Inc., No. 3:17-cv-05659-WHA , 2021 WL 3140716, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 26, 2021) \n(pending appeal in Fed. Cir. Case No. 21-2253) (\"In no way does this order vindicate Attorneys \nJames R. Hannah, Lisa Kobialka , and Paul J. Andre. Their conduct was improper and frustrated \nthe fairness of the proceedings . Judges in the future should take this into account when dealing \nwith them in future cases.\"); Midwest Athletics & Sports All. LLC v. Ricoh USA, Inc., No. 2:19-\ncv-00514-JDW , 2021 WL 1907475, at *6 (E.D. Pa. May 12, 2021) (pending appeal in Fed. Cir. \nCase No. 21-2340) (\"No court likes to say that a party acted in bad faith, but the Court questions \nhow MASA and its attorneys could have thought that such conduct fell within expected standards \nof practice.\") (cleaned up))). While the need for deterrence must be considered in deciding \nwhether a case is exceptional, I do not believe these attorneys ' misconduct in unrelated cases \n(which seems worse than what I saw) described in opinions issued well after the final judgment in \nthis case should too heavily cloud my consideration of whether the present case was exceptional. \n5 What I said previously about the conduct in this case (D.I. 422) stands, 1 and it is Defendants ' \nstrongest single argument for an exceptional case determination , but I nevertheless do not think it \nhad a significant impact on the proceedings in this case. Thus, the conduct, while regrettable , \ndoes not in my opinion justify a finding that the case is exceptional. \nIn sum, I agree with Defendants that there are multiple instances where Plaintiffs counsel \ncould and in some instances should have litigated this case differentl y, and I understand \nDefendants ' frustration. Yet, I do not believe the totality of these instances proves that this case \nwas exceptional. \nHaving found that Defendants have not shown that this case was exceptional , I need not \ndetermine whether attorneys' fees should be awarded against Plaintiffs principals , alter egos, and \nattorneys. (See D.I. 521 at 16-18; see also Dragon Intel!. Prop., LLC v. DISH Network L.L.C., \nNo. CV 13-2066-RGA , 2021 WL 5177680, at *5 (D. Del. Nov. 8, 2021) (\"The Federal Circuit \nheld in two non-precedential opinions that\u00a7 285 does not permit a fee award against counsel.\")). \nI note Defendants ' request that I reconsider my decision in Dragon Intellectual Property \n(somewhat ironically given their complaint that Plaintiff relitigates issues), and extols the virtue \nof Iris Connex LLC v. Dell, Inc., 235 F.Supp. 3d 826 (E.D. Tex. 2017). Whatever the virtue of \nIris Connex might be in its factual context, one thing that stands out is that the Court's \nconsideration of attorneys ' fees did not result in the award of attorneys ' fees against counsel for \nhis litigation of the case ( although he was sanctioned pursuant to Rule 11 ). \nFurther, Defendants argue, \"Alternatively, the Court should award Defendants their fees \nand costs under its inherent power.\" (D.I. 521 at 19-20, 19 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927)). For the \n1 I note that I had a trial with the same counsel last fall and no similar issues arose. \n6 same reasons described above regarding 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285, I do not find that Plaintiff's counsel has \n\"(1) multiplied proceedings ; (2) unreasonabl y and vexatiously; (3) thereby increasing the cost of \nthe proceedings ; (4) with bad faith or with intentional misconduct. \" LaSalle, 287 F.3d at 288. I \nalso note that it would be a rare case where there could be a basis for an inherent power sanction \nwhen there was an insufficient basis for a\u00a7 285 finding. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nDefendants ' motion for attorneys' fees and costs is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 15th day of July, 2022. \n7 "}
