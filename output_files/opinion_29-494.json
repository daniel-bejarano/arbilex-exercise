{"case_name": "Presidio Inc, Presidio Holdings Inc, Presidio Solutions LLC v. Eric Closson and Mathew McPherson", "case_number": "29-494", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "12-23-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nPRESIDIO, INC., PRESIDIO \nHOLDINGS, INC., and PRESIDIO \nNETWORKED SOLUTIONS, LLC, \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nERIC CLOSSON and MATTHEW \nMCPHERSON, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 22-494-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPresidio, Inc., Presidio Holdings, Inc., and Presidio Networked Solutions, \nLLC (collectively, Presidio) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants \nEric Closson and Matthew McPherson in the Delaware Court of Chancery. D.I. 4. \nDefendants timely filed a Notice of Removal in this Court based on diversity \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. D.I. 1. Presidio has moved to remand the \ncase to the Court of Chancery pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). D.I. 10. Presidio \nargues that remand is required because forum selection clauses in the employment \nagreements at issue in the case waived the parties' right to remove an action to \nfederal court from the Court of Chancery. D.I. 10 at 3-4. \n\"It is settled that the removal statutes [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441-1452] are to be \nstrictly construed against removal and all doubts should be resolved in favor of remand.\" Steel Valley Auth. v. Union Switch & Signal Div., 809 F.2d 1006, 1010 \n(3d Cir. 1987). The party seeking removal bears the burden to establish federal \njurisdiction. Id. That burden is a high one when seeking to avoid a forum \nselection clause. MIS Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 401 U.S. 1, 15 \n(1972), overruled on other grounds by Lines v. Chesser, 490 U.S. 495 (1989). \n\"Such clauses are prima facie valid and should be enforced unless enforcement is \nshown by the resisting party to be 'unreasonable' under the circumstances.\" MIS \nBremen, 401 U.S. at 10. \nTo determine whether parties have contractually waived the right to remove \nto federal court, a court should \"us[ e] the same benchmarks of construction and, if \napplicable, interpretation as it employs in resolving all preliminary contractual \nquestions.\" Foster v. Chesapeake Ins. Co., Ltd., 933 F.2d 1207, 1217 n.15 (3d Cir. \n1991 ). Thus, the court looks to the \"plain and ordinary meaning\" of the forum \nselection clause to determine whether it amounted to a waiver of the right to \nremove. New Jersey v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 640 F.3d 545, 548 (3d Cir. \n2011) (citing Buono Sales, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 449 F.2d 715, 721 (3d \nCir. 1971)). \nThe employment agreements at issue contain the same forum selection \nclause. That clause, titled \"Consent to Jurisdiction,\" reads in relevant part: \ni. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY \nCONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF \n2 THE CHANCERY COURTS OF THE STATE OF \nDELAWARE AND THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR \nTHE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE . . . FOR THE \nPURPOSE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER \nPROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, OR IN \nCONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT. \nii. EACH PARTY HEREBY ... COVENANTS \nTHAT IT SHALL NOT SEEK ... TO CHALLENGE OR \nSET ASIDE ANY DECISION, AW ARD OR \nJUDGNIENT OBTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH \nTHE PROVISIONS HEREOF. \n111. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY \nEXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL OBJECTIONS IT \nMAY HAVE TO VENUE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT \nLIMITATION, THE INCONVENIENCE OF SUCH \nFORUM, IN ANY OF SUCH COURTS .... \nD.I. 10, Ex. A \u00a7 6.e, Ex. B \u00a7 6.e ( capitalization in the original) ( emphasis added). \nThus, under the employment agreements, the parties waived \"any and all\" \nobjections they might have to venue \"in any of such courts\"-i.e., the Court of \nChancery and this Court. I agree, then, with Presidio that this clause constitutes an \nunambiguous waiver of the right to challenge a party's selection of either the Court \nof Chancery or this Court as a venue to litigate a dispute arising out of the \nemployment agreements. Accordingly, once Presidio selected the Court of \nChancery as the venue to litigate its Complaint, Defendants waived their right to \nobject-by removal or otherwise-to that venue. \nDefendants argue that \"[t]his provision does not operate as a 'plain and \nordinary' waiver of the right to remove because the parties intended that relevant \n3 disputes would be litigated in a court in Delaware-not that it would be required to \nremain in state court solely because Presidio happened to file a lawsuit in state \ncourt first.\" D.I. 14 at 6. Defendants are correct insofar as the forum selection \nclause shows that the parties intended to litigate their disputes in one of two courts \n(not \"a court\" or \"any\" court) located in Delaware-either the Chancery Court or \nthis Court. But the plain and ordinary language of the clause also makes clear that \nthe parties waived their right to make \"any and all\" venue objections if a party \nbrought suit in one of those courts. \nDefendants' reading of the forum selection clause would render nugatory the \nwaiver-of-objections-to-venue clause. Tellingly, Defendants make no attempt in \ntheir briefing to explain what the parties intended by the words \"each of the parties \nhereto hereby expressly waives any and all objections it may have to venue ... in \nany of such courts.\" The parties agree that Delaware law governs the \ninterpretation of the employment agreements. See D.I. 14 at 5; D.I. 15 at 5. And \nunder Delaware law, when interpreting contracts, courts \"give[] meaning to every \nword in the agreement and avoid[] interpretations that would result in 'superfluous \nverbiage.\"' Seidensticker v. Gasparilla Inn, Inc., 2007 WL 4054473, at *3 (Del. \nCh. Nov. 8, 2007). \n4 In short, by waiving \"any and all objections\" to venue in the Court of \nChancery or this Court, Defendants waived their right to remove this lawsuit from \nPresidio' s chosen forum. \nDefendants insist, and I recognize, that this holding is in tension with Sanyo \nElectric Co. v. Intel Corp., 2019 WL 1650067 (D. Del. Apr. 17, 2019). In that \ncase, the court rejected Sanyo's argument that Intel's adoption of a forum selection \nclause virtually identical to the clause at issue in this case constituted a waiver of \nIntel's right to remove to this Court a case Sanyo had filed in the Court of \nChancery. The forum selection clause in Sanyo read: \nAll disputes and litigation arising out of or related to this \nAgreement, including without limitation matters \nconnected with its performance, shall be subject to the \nexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of \nDelaware or of the Federal courts sitting therein. Each \nParty and each Granting Subsidiary hereby irrevocably \nsubmits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and \nirrevocably waives all objections to such venue. \nId. at *5. The court in Sanyo held that \"on its face\" this clause \"states that either \nfederal or state court is permitted so long as the court is in Delaware\" and that the \nclause \"indicate[ s] an agreement to certain geographical locations for the \nconvenience of the parties rather than a waiver of the defendant's rights to \nremoval.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ( emphasis added). \nI agree with the court's determination in Sanyo that the clause at issue \nindicates an agreement to limit the geographic location of acceptable litigation fora \n5 to Delaware. But agreeing that a suit can be litigated in either state or federal \ncourts located in Delaware is one thing. Agreeing that a suit must be litigated in \nthe court in which it was first filed is another thing. The two are neither the same \nnor mutually exclusive; it does not follow as a matter of logic that because the \nparties agreed to sue in Delaware, they did not also agree to waive the transfer ( or \nremoval) of a suit brought initially in one of those Delaware courts to another \nDelaware court. \nThe court's interpretation of the forum selection clause in Sanyo gives no \nmeaning to the words \"irrevocably waives all objections to venue.\" For that \nreason, I do not find it persuasive. \nNOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington on this Twenty-second day of \nDecember in 2022, it is HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand \n(D.I. 10) is GRANTED. \n6 "}
