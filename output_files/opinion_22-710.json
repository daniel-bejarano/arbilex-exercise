{"case_name": "Tkach et al v. RumbleOn, Inc.", "case_number": "22-710", "judge": "Judge Richard G.

Civil Action No. 22- 00710- RGA \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS\u2019 MOTION TO REMAND TO \nTHE COURT OF CHANCERY  \n Before me is Plaintiffs\u2019 motion  to remand  this action to the Delaware Court of \nChancery pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447.  (D.I. 15) .  The motion has been fully brief ed, and I have \nconsidered the parties\u2019 briefing.  ( D.I. 16, 23, 28 ). \n Upon removal of an action to federal court, a plaintiff may challenge such removal \nby moving to remand the case back to state court.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).   Removal provisions  \n\u201care to be strictly construed  against removal and all doubts should be resolved in favor of remand. \u201d  \nBoyer v. Snap- On Tools Corp., 913 F.2d 108, 111 (3d Cir. 1990) (internal citations omitted).  The \nparty seeking removal bears the burden to establish federal jurisdiction.  See Steel Valley Auth. v. \nUnion Switch & Signal Div., 809 F.2d 1006, 1010 (3d Cir. 1987); Zo ren v. Genesis Energy, LP .,  \n195 F. Supp. 2d 598, 602 (D. Del. 2002).  That burden is a high one when seeking  to avoid a \nforum selection clause.  M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off \u2013Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972), overruled \non other grounds by  Lines v. Chasser, 490 U.S. 495 (1989); ING Bank, FSB. v. Palmer , 2010 WL 2 \n 3907825, *1 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2010) (holding that a strong presumption exists in favor of \nenforcing a forum selection clause).   \u201cA forum selection clause does not oust a court of subject \nmatter jurisdiction ,\u201d M/S Bremen , 407 U.S. at 12, but \u201cwhile the federal court has jurisdiction, it \nshould decline to exercise it .\u201d  Foster v. Chesapeake Ins. Co., 933 F.2d 1207, 1212 n. 7 (3d Cir. \n1991) .  Forum selection clauses are \u201cprima facie valid and should  be enforced unless enforcement \nis shown by the resisting party to be \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the circumstances.\u201d  M/S Bremen , 407 \nU.S. at 10.    \nIn determin ing whether  the legal effect of a forum selection clause was to waive a party\u2019s \nright to remove to federal court , a court should use \u201cthe same benchmarks of construction and, if \napplicable, interpretation as it employs in resolving all preliminary contractual questio ns.\u201d  \nFoster,  933 F.2d at 1217 n. 15.  The district court must look to the \u201cplain and ordinary meaning\u201d \nof the clause\u2019s language to determine whether it amount s to a waiver of the right to remove .  New \nJersey v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 640 F.3d 545, 548 (3d C ir. 2011) (internal citations omitted).   The \nThird Circuit has held that a court may find a  waiver  of removal  on this basis even if the forum \nselection clause at issue lacks  an explicit waiver of removal .  Foster , 933 F.2d at 1216- 17 (finding \nthat defendant, by consenting to \u201c submit \u201d to \u201cany court\u201d of competent jurisdiction \u201cat the request \nof\u201d plaintiff , agreed to go  to, and stay in, plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum ). \nHere, Plaintiffs contend that  they are entitled to remand because  Defendan t contractually \nwaived its right to remove by agreeing to the forum selection clause in Section 11 .1(a) of the Plan \nof Merger and Equity Purchase Agreement  (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) .  The relevant portion of the \nAgreement reads:  \n(a) ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT,  THE \nOTHER ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS 3 \n CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR ANY ACTION OR  OTHER \nDISPUTE INVOLVING THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCE  RELATED PARTIES \nARISING OUT OF OR BASED ON THIS  AGREEMENT, THE OTHER \nADDITIONAL  AGREEMENTS OR THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED \nHEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF \nTHE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF \nDELAWARE, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE \nEXCLUSIVE  JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS I N ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION \nOR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY \nWAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF  VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION \nOR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND \nAGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH \nSUIT, ACTION OR  PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN  \nBROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  \n \n(D.I. 16- 1, Ex. A, \u00a7 11.1(a) ). \n \nWhen faced with  forum selection clauses with similar language to the present clause, \ndistrict courts in this circuit have reached  different conclusions  on whether the parties have waived \ntheir right to remove .  Compare , e.g.,  Definition Services, Inc. v. GVA Capital Ltd., 2021 WL \n6846201, *3 (D. Del. Nov. 17, 2021) (no waiver) , Sanyo Electric Co. v. Intel Corp., 2019 WL \n1650067, *6 (D. Del. Apr. 17, 2019)  (same),1 and Periodical Graphics, Inc. v. Spitz , 1994 WL \n502506, *3 (E.D. Pa. 1994)  (same) , with InterDig ital, Inc. v. Wistron Corp., 2015 WL 4537133, \n*1 (D. Del. June 18, 2015)  (waiver ), Carlyle Inv. Management, L.L.C. v. Carlyle Capital Corp. , \n800 F. Supp. 2d 639, 644-45 (D. Del. 2011)  (same ), and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Quality \nCarriers, Inc., 2011 WL 776211, *3 (D.  Del. Feb. 28, 2011)  (same ). \n \n1  No party has cited this case or Periodical Graphics , Inc. v. Spitz , 1994 WL 502506 (E.D. \nPa. 1994) in its briefing.  I note that, in any event, the forum selection clause in Sanyo Elec. was \nnot determinative of the outcome of the motion to remand.  Sanyo Elec., 2019 WL 1650067, at \n*6 (remanding on other grounds).  Thus, my interpretation of the forum selection clause in that \ncase is dicta.   4 \n These cases weigh in Plaintiffs \u2019 favor.  In particular, I agree with Plaintiffs that there is no  \nmaterial difference between the contractual language  at issue  in Carlyle  and the language of  \nSection 11.1(a) of the  Agreement.   In Carlyle , the relevant portion of the  forum selection clause \nat issue read  as follows : \nThe federal or state courts sitting in Delaware shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any \naction, suit or proceedin g with respect to this Agreement and each party hereto hereby \nirrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may have, whether now or in the future, to the laying of venue in, or to the jurisdiction of, any and each of su ch courts  for the purposes of any such suit, action, proceeding or judgment and \nfurther waives any claim that any such suit, action, proceeding or judgment has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and each party hereto hereby submits to such jurisdiction . \n \n800 F. Supp. 2d at 644.  \n The distinction Defendant seeks to draw \u2014ostensibly between the \u201cirrevocabl[e]\u201d waiver  \nof objections  in Carlyle and the \u201cirrevocabl[e] and unconditional[]\u201d waivers in Section 11.1(a) \u2014\nreveals only a n inconsequential difference in word choice.  The core elements  of each clause are \nthe same.  Both provide that federal or state courts  shall have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over actions \narising from the contract ; both provide that  each party \u201csubmit s\u201d to such jurisdiction;  and both \nprovide that each party \u201cirrevocably\u201d waives any objection to  venue and any claim that the action \nhas been brought in an inconvenient forum .  Id. ; (D.I. 16 -1, Ex. A, \u00a7 11.1(a)).  The court in \nCarlyle concluded  that such language  effected a waiver .  800 F. Supp. 2d at 645.  I do so again  \nhere.   \nDefendant \u2019s reliance on  Definition Services , 2021 WL 6846201, is unavailing.   In that \ncase, the court found that the disputed forum selection clause did not constitute  a waiver  because \nit lacked \u201cmandatory language\u201d evincing the parties\u2019 intent to waive their right to remove .  Id. at \n*3.  Indeed, all the clause provided was that a ny action would be brought in Delaware  and that 5 \n the parties would submit to the jurisdiction and venue .  Id. at *1.  By contrast, Section 11.1(a) \ncontains additional language  whereby , \u201cin any such court\u201d where the parties have \u201cirrevocably\u201d \nsubmitted to ex clusive jurisdiction,  each party  \u201cirrevocab ly and unconditionally waive[s] \u201d any \nobjection to venue  and \u201cirrevocably waive[s]\u201d any claim that the action is brought in an \ninconvenient  forum .  See id. at *2 -3 (distinguishing Carlyle  and Quality Carriers on the basis of \nsimilar  \u201cmandatory  language \u201d); see also InterDigital, 2015 WL 4537133 at *1 (\u201c[I]t would seem \nodd for parties who \u2018 irrevocably consent \u2019 to sue one another (if at all) in Delaware federal or  state \ncourt to also agree that they can challenge (by way of removal) each  other \u2019s decision to file in \nDelaware state court. \u201d). \nI conclude, therefore , that the present forum selection clause contains sufficient mandatory \nlanguage to convey that the partie s intended to waive their right to remove to federal court.   \nFurther, Defendant has made no showing that the clause is  \u201cunreasonable\u201d  under the \ncircumstances.   See M/S Bremen , 407 U.S. at 10.     \nFor these reasons , Plaintiffs\u2019  motion to remand to the Court  of Chancery  (D.I. 15) is \nGRANTED.  The case is REMANDED to the Court of Chancery. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n Entered this 22\nnd day of  September , 2022.  \n   \n/s/ Richard G. Andrews ____ \nUnited States District Judge  "}
