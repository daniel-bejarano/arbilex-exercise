Andrews", "date": "04-08-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 22-085-RGA\nANTHONY S. FAUCI, et al., :\n\nDefendants.\n\nShantell D. Newman, Wilmington, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nApril 8, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nANDREWS, & District Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Snantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 4). She commenced this action on the basis of a\nfederal question, a federal defendant, and violations of the Moroccan-American Treaty\nof Peace and Friendship, the \u201cNuremberg Code,\u201d and of Human Rights. (D.I. 2 at 3).\nThe Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff sues Defendants Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Bill and\nMelinda Gates, and the \u201cBiden Administration.\u201d While not a model of clarity, it seems\nshe takes exception to a COVID vaccination mandate, asks that it stop, and seeks 1.5\nmillion dollars in damages.\n\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a\ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir.\n\n2013). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must accept\n\nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to\na pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, her\n\npleading is liberally construed and her Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be\n1\nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Weitzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d /d.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\nasserted. See id. at 11.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\n\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\n2\n\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u2019\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\nDISCUSSION\n\nThere are no allegations that Plaintiff is a federal worker or that any federal\nmandate requiring vaccines applies to her. Bill and Melinda Gates are not federal\nactors and, therefore, the claim against them is not cognizable. See Bivens v. Six\nUnknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 389 (1971)\n(where a litigant sue federal actors for damages on constitutional grounds, the claim is\ngoverned by Bivens). Moreover, the Biden Administration, which | take to mean the\nexecutive branch of the U.S. Government, has sovereign immunity. See United States\nv. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980) (it is well established that an action against the\nUnited States cannot be maintained unless the United States waives its sovereign\nimmunity). Finally, the Complaint contains no plausible allegations supporting a request\n\nfor relief against Dr. Fauci.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).. Amendment is futile.\n3\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n"}
