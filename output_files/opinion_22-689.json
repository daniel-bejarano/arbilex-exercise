The Order denied  Debtors\u2019 motion pursuant to \nRule 60 of the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure (\u201cFRCP 60\u201d), made applicable by Rule 9024 of  \nthe Federal Rules  of Bankruptcy Procedure (\u201cFRBP 9024\u201d), for relief from certain releases \ncontained in their confirmed plan , solely as th ose releases  pertain to their bankruptcy counsel, \nPillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (\u201cPillsbury\u201d) , under theory that  the p lan contains  \nprospective malpractice releases obtained without Debtors\u2019  informed consent  in violation of \nPillsbury\u2019s ethical obligations  under Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(h) .1  For reasons set forth \non the record at the May 4, 2022 hearing ( A1357- 1365)  (\u201c5/4/2022 Tr.\u201d ),2 including that s ections \n1127 and 1144 of the Bankruptcy Code state the only means by which a plan confirmation order \nmay be modified or revoked, the Bankruptcy Court denied Debtors\u2019 motion for relief.  For the \nreasons set forth herein, the Court will affirm the Order.  \n \n1  See, e.g., ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(h) , which provides , in relevant \npart, that \u201cA lawyer shall not . . . make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer \u2019s \nliability to a client for malpractice unless the client is independently represented in making \nthe agreement .\u201d Available at:  https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_ \nresponsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_8_current_clients_specific_rules/ . \n \n2  The docket of the chapter 11 cases, captioned In SC SJ  Holdings, LLC, et al ., Case No.  21-\n10549 (JTD) (Bankr.

I. 25) is cited herein as \u201cB__.\u201d  2 I. BACKGROUND \nA. The Chapter 11 Cases \nDebtors operated an 805 -room luxury convention hotel in San Jose, California  (\u201cHotel\u201d) , \nwhich experienced financial difficulties due to the COVID -19 pandemic .  (A 29-31 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10).  \nBeginning in the fall and winter of 2020, the Hotel\u2019s operator, Fairmont , refused requests for \nfinancing and would not agree to a consensual termination of the Hotel Mana gement Agreement \n(\u201cHMA\u201d) so that Debtors could pursue financing from other hotel operators.  ( A33 \u00b6 17).  Debtors \nretained Pillsbury in July 2020 to provide advice on \u201cconsidering and developing chapter 11 \noptions.\u201d   (A91 1-13).  In March 2021, with economic conditions having only worsened, Debtors \nfiled voluntary c hapter 11 petitions.  Debtors identified three core  objectives for the bankruptcy: \n(1) engage with their pre -petition secured lender to  restructure and extend the maturity date of their \nsecured mo rtgage loan; (2) terminate the relationship with Fairmont; and (3) find a new brand for \nthe Hotel that would be willing  to provide additional financing.  (A8 \u00b6 28).  \nB. The Plan \u2019s Release Provisions \nAs part of the negotiations among Debtors and various constituents, the Plan went through \na number of revisions between March and August 2021.  ( See, e.g ., A37, A96, A155, A460, A523, \nA587).  Each version of the Plan contained  substantively identical  release, exculpatory, and \ninjunctive provisions.  The release provisions provide for mutual releases among numerous parties as to any claims arising out of or related to the bankruptcy proceedings or to Debtors.  Those release provisions cover Debtors\u2019 \u201cRelated Persons,\u201d defined to include their \u201c attorneys . . . a nd \nother professionals.\u201d  (A790, A792, A829-830).  The r elease provisions also expressly exculpate \nDebtors and their \u201cProfessionals\u201d from claims and causes of action arising out of post -petition \nconduct, with the exception of claims of intentional fraud and willful misconduct.   (A783, A832-3 833).3  The release provisions were highlighted in various disclosure statements as well as in the \nPlan solicitation materials approved by the Bankruptcy Court and noticed to all creditors, parties \nin interest, and stakeholders.  (See A217; A301; A401- 459).  Debto rs\u2019 sole principal, Sam Hirbod, \nsubmitted sworn testimony to the Bankruptcy Court in support of the Plan specifically addressing its release provisions.  (A710- 716).  Mr. Hirbod affirmed that the releases were in Debtors\u2019 best \ninterest and integral to their successful reorganization.  (A713- 714 \u00b6\u00b6 10 -14). \nThe Bankruptcy Court approved the  plan of reorganization (\u201c the Plan\u201d) that achieved \nDebtors\u2019 objectives  (A717 -770) (\u201cthe Confirmation Order\u201d) .  The  Bankruptcy Court found that \nthe release provisions in the  Plan were set forth in bold type, contained \u201cspecific and conspicuous \nlanguage,\u201d had been \u201cnegotiated in good faith and at arm\u2019s length,\u201d and were \u201ceach integral to the \nPlan, supported by valuable  consideration, and necessary for the Debtors\u2019 successful \nreorganization.\u201d  (A721,  A727).  The Bankruptcy Court also found that Debtors\u2019  releases were \n\u201cgiven and made after due notice and opportunity for hearing\u201d and that  the exculpations were \n\u201creasonable in scope.\u201d  ( A738, A740).    \nDebtors  later assert ed, and continue to assert  on appeal , that \u201c [t]he Plan contains five -and-\none-half pages of release, exculpatory, and injunctive legal jargon in bold, all -caps lettering that \nmakes it impossible to identify defined terms without cross -referencing each word in those  \nprovisions against the Plan\u2019s 179 defined terms, many of which cross reference one another.  (See A931 -932; D.I. 21 at 8). \n \n3  The release provision and the exculpation provision are enforced by an injunction \nprovision, which specifies that \u201cthe releasing parties shall be permanently enjoined from commencing or continuing in any manner against the debtor released parties . . . and the \nexculpated parties.\u201d  (A833 -834).  This Memorandum Opinion refers to all three provisions \ntogether as the \u201crelease provisions.\u201d  4 C. The Fairmont A rbitration  \nFairmont filed proofs of claim  against the Debtors in the amount of approximately \n$36 million  for claims un der the HMA .  Fairmont also  commenced an arbitration action asserting  \nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  The Bankruptcy Court ordered the Debtors \nto arbitration  and e stimated Fairmont\u2019s claim for plan feasibility purposes at $22.24 million.  \n(A930 \u00b6 4).  On August 18, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order.  The six -\nday arbitration between Debtors and Fairmont began on September 22 and concluded on \nOctober  16, 2021.  The Plan went effective on November 8, 2021.  ( A844).  The parties agree that \nthe Plan was substantially consummated the same day.  On November 9, 2021, the arbitration panel issued a Final  Arbitration Award (\u201c the Final Award\u201d) , setting F airmont\u2019s damages  for \nDebtors\u2019 breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing at approximately $13 million.  ( A933 \n\u00b6 8).  The arbitrators found such a breach based on Debtors\u2019 \u201cshopping [of] the brand. \u201d  (Id.).   \nNot surprisingly, the parties disagree as to  the events that led to the Fairmont dispute.  \nThose facts have no bearing on this appeal , and the parties \u2019 arguments a re briefly summarized here \nonly to provide context for Debtors\u2019 subsequent  motion for relief .  In general, Debtors wish to \nassert malpractice claims on the grounds that (i) Pillsbury failed to inform Debtors that \u201chaving \ndiscussions with other [hotel brands] violated the HMA\u2019s implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\u201d and advised the Debtors that Fairmont\u2019s sole remedy at law for terminating the HMA was \nits liquidated damages provision, which would amount to approximately $2 million; and (ii) \u201cPillsb ury\u2019s advice essentially and unnecessarily created two paths of expensive litigation, the \nbankruptcy and the arbitration.\u201d  (D.I. 21 at 7-8).   Pillsbury  disputes these contentions, assert ing \nthat it \u201c was not made aware of the details of Mr. Hirbod\u2019s brand -changing efforts or provided with \na copy of the HMA until after November 2, 2020, and Pillsbury was not asked for any advice with 5 respect to brand -changing efforts until after  November 2, 2020  \u2013 that is, until after Mr. Hirbod \nundertook the secretive rebranding efforts that led to the damage award.\u201d  (D.I. 22 at 9 n.3). \nD. Debtors\u2019  Motion for Relief  \nOn February 28, 2022 \u2013 more than 180 days after the entry of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \nAugust 18, 2021 Confi rmation O rder and long after the November 8, 2021 substantial \nconsummation of the Plan \u2013 Debtors filed a motion , pursuant to FRCP 60 and FRBP 9024,4 asking \nthe Bankruptcy Court for an order \u201crelieving [them] from certain aspects of the confirmed Third \nAmended Joint  Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization. \u201d  (A928).  Debtors asked the Bankruptcy Court \nto \u201cmodify\u201d the Plan\u2019s release provisions, which Debtors admitte d barred them from bringing their \ndesired legal malpractice claims against Pillsbury.  ( A934, A940, A943- 44, A946).  Debtors \nasserted, among other things, that (i) prior to the Plan\u2019s effective date, Debtors were unaware of Pillsbury\u2019s alleged malpractice,  and (ii) Pillsbury failed to advise Debtors of the import of the \nPlan\u2019s release provisions.  Debtors argued that the Bankruptcy Court had the authority to grant \nsuch relief under FRBP 9024 on several bases including changed circumstances  and excusable \nneglect .  (See A928, A944).  Pillsbury objected to Debtors\u2019 motion, explaining that it was improper \nand untimely under the Bankruptcy Code and FRBP 9024, contained a revisionist account of the \u201cfacts,\u201d and was otherwise entirely without merit.  (A965-85).  Debtors then filed a reply in which \nthey asserted, for the first time, that the Due Process Clause of the Constitution provided a basis for the Bankruptcy Court to grant Debtors\u2019 requested relief.   (A1196-98 ). \nOn May 4, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing and based on the  undisputed facts \ndenied Debtors\u2019 motion for relief as a matter of law.  ( 5/4/2022 Tr. at 76-84).  The Bankruptcy \n \n4  FRCP  60 permits the  Court to relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding \nfor reasons including, but not limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect; \nnewly discovered evidence; or fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse \nparty.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) -(6).  Pursuant to Ba nkruptcy Rule 9024, Rule 60 applies \nto contested matters such as this matter .  See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9024. 6 Court determined that  Debtors\u2019 request for \u201crelief\u201d from the Plan really sought modification of the \nPlan or  revocation  of the Confirm ation  Order , which could be accomplished only under \nBankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 1127 or  1444.  ( 5/4/2022 Tr.  at 77-78; see id. at 84 (explaining that Debtors \nwere effectively seeking to \u201cwrit[e]  the releases and exculpation provisions out of the orde r\u201d with \nrespect to Pillsbury);  11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1127, 1144).  T he Bankruptcy Court concluded that Debtors \ndid not satisfy the requirements for relief under either of those provisions.  \nThe Bankruptcy Court further explained  that, under \u00a7 1127(b), a movant may seek plan \nmodification only before a plan\u2019s substantial  consummation  \u2013 and Debtors did not seek relief here \nuntil well after the Plan was  confirmed and substantially consummated.  ( 5/4/2022 Tr. at 78-79). \nDebtors also could not seek revocation of the Confirmation O rder under \u00a7 1144, the  Bankruptcy \nCourt found, because they undisputedly filed their motion outside of \u00a7 1144\u2019s 180- day post -\nconfirmation deadline  \u2013 a deadline that \u201cis strictly enforced and may  not be extended\u201d for any \nreason.  ( Id. at 79).  The Bankruptcy Court rejected  Debtors\u2019 argument that a purported breach of \nethical obligations by Pillsbury allowed for an exception to \u00a7 1144\u2019s plain- text requirements.  ( Id. \nat 80-81).  In addition, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the limitations on relief set forth  in \u00a7\u00a7 1127 \nand 1144 cannot be circumvented by means of a motion for  relief under FRBP 9024.  ( Id. at 78-\n80).  Having disposed of the entire motion as a matter of law, the Bankruptcy Court  declined \nDebtors\u2019 request to hold an evidentiary hearing  for purposes of an appeal. \nE. Appeal  \nOn May 26, 2022, Debtors filed a timely notice of appeal of the Order .  (D.I. 1).  The appeal \nis fully briefed.  (D.I. 21, 22, 25).  The Court did not hear oral argument because the facts and legal \narguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not \nbe significantly aided by oral argument. 7 II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nThe Court has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a final judgment of the bankruptcy court \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1).  The Confirmation Order is a final order.  The Order denying \nDebtors\u2019 request for relief from the Confirmation Order i s also a final order.  \nWhethe r the Bankruptcy Court erred in ruling, as a matter of law, that the  plain text of \n\u00a7\u00a7 1127 and 1144 bars Debtors\u2019 request for  relief from the release  provisions of the  substantially \nconsummated plan of reorganization \u2013 including whether FRBP 9024, which makes FRCP  60 \napplicable to bankruptcy proceedings under certain circumstances, override s those statutes  \u2013 is a \npurely legal  issue  reviewed  de novo.  See In re Trans Wor ld Airlines, Inc ., 145 F.3d 124, 131 \n(3d Cir. 1998).  Whether Pillsbury\u2019s actions violated the Due Process  Clause is a purely legal issue \nthat is  also reviewed de novo. See id .  Finally, Debtors argue that the Bankruptcy Court erroneously \ndeclined to  hold an evidentiary hearing.  The Court reviews that decision  for abuse of discretion.  \nSee id.  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nDebtors sought relief from the Plan\u2019s release provisions pursuant to FRCP 60 (b)(5), which \nauthorizes relief where \u201cit is no longer  equitable that a judgment should have prospective \napplication.\u201d  (A935- 36 (quoting In re Lebanon Steel Foundry , 48 B.R. 520, 523 (Bankr. M.D. Pa. \n1985))).  Debtors argued that modification of the terms of an injunctive decree was within the \nBankruptcy Cour t\u2019s discretion \u201cif the  circumstances, whether of law or fact, obtaining at the time \nof the issuance have changed, or new  ones have since arisen.\u201d  ( Id. (quoting In re Lebanon, 48 B.R. \nat 523) ).  Debtors contended that they only learned  of Pillsbury\u2019s incorrect advice regarding \nFairmont after the Plan was confirmed, and that thi s change in  \u201cfactual  circumstances \u201d warranted \nrelief from the Plan\u2019s release provisions .  (A936).  Debtors further argued that FRCP 60(b) (1)\u2019s \nexcusable neglect provision permitted relief .  (A944).  Thus, Debtors\u2019 main argument on appeal is 8 that relief they sought was available under FRCP 60 (b), and that the Bankruptcy Court erred in \ndetermining that \u00a7\u00a7 1127 and 1144 of the Bankruptcy Code  \u2013 requirements of which they failed \nto meet  \u2013 provided the exclusive means of relief.  ( See D.I. 21 at 14-26).  \nA. Plan Modification Is Barred By  \u00a7 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code  \n1. Section 1127 Bars Plan Modification  \nSection 1127(b) states , in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he proponent of a plan or the reorganized \ndebtor may modify such plan at any time after confirmation of such plan and before substantial \nconsummation of  such plan .\u201d  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(b) (emphasis added).  Accordingly, by its plain \nterms  \u201csection 1127(b) is an absolute bar to modification after substantial consummation.\u201d  In re \nNorthEast Gas Generation, LLC , 639 B.R. 914, 922 (Bankr. D. Del. 2022).   \nThe Bankruptcy Court recognized that \u00a7 1127(b) is \u201cthe exclusive means by which to \nmodify a [Chapter 11] plan.\u201d  ( See 5/4/2022 Tr. at 77 -78 (citing In re Logan Place Properties, \nLtd., 327 B.R. 811, 812 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2005) and In re Vencor, Inc ., 284 B.R. 79, 87 (Bankr. \nD. Del. 2002)).  See also, In re Rickel & Assocs., Inc ., 260 B.R. 673, 677 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2001) \n(\u201cSection 1127(b) provides the sole means for modifying a confirmed plan.\u201d); In re Daewoo Motor \nAm., Inc., 488 B.R. 418, 426- 27 (C.D. Cal. 2011); In re WBY, Inc., 2019 WL 3713686, at *10-11 \n(Bankr. N.D. Ga. Aug. 5, 2019); 7 Richard Levin &  Henry J. Sommer, eds., C OLLIER ON \nBANKRUPTCY  \u00b6 1127.03[2][a] (16th ed. 2022).   \nThe parties do not dispute that Debtors\u2019 motion for relief was filed after the Plan had been \nsubstantially consummated.  The Plan was substantially consummated, and became eff ective, on \nNovember 8, 2021.  ( See A844; see also  A770).  Debtors did not file their motion in the Bankruptcy \nCourt until February 28, 2022 \u2013 nearly four months after substantial consummation.  ( See A949).  \nRather, Debtors argue that the Bankruptcy Court erred in determining that \u00a7 1127(b) applies at all \nto their motion and that it bars relief from the Plan\u2019s release provisions. 9 2. Debtors\u2019 Motion for Relief Sought Plan Modification \nDebtors\u2019 primary argument , repeated t hroughout their briefs, is that \u00a7 1127(b) did not apply \nto their request for relief because they are not seeking any \u201c modification \u201d of the Plan.  ( See, e.g., \nD.I. 21 at 2, 13-14, 16-17, 19-22, 25).  Rath er, Debtors  contend, they merely seek  \u201climited relief \u201d \nfrom the Plan  \u2013 specifically, \u201cto have the Bankruptcy Court determine that those portions of the \nRelease Provisions applicable to Pillsbury were improperly obtained and, ineffective, and thus \nunenforceable, thereby granting limited relief  from the provisions to allow Debtors to pursue \nmalpractice claims against Pillsbury \u201d \u2013 and \u201c [s]uch relief is appropriate under Rule 9024 and \nRule 60.\u201d  ( Id. at 13 ).  According to Pillsbury, Debtors want a change to the Plan that is directly \ncontrary to the Plan\u2019s express provisions, so there is no question that what they seek constitutes a \n\u201cmodif[ication]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1127(b) \u2013 regardless of the magnitude o f that change.   \n(D.I. 22 at 20-21 ).   \nThe Court  agrees that Debtors\u2019 motion for relief really sought a modification of the Plan \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 1127(b).   As an initial matter, the motion candidly and repeatedly urges \nthe Bankruptcy Court to \u201cmodif y the Plan so as to permit Debtors to pursue malpractice claims \nagainst Pillsbury.\u201d  (A940; see, e.g ., A943 (\u201cthis Court should modify  the provisions that stand to \nprevent Debtors from fully and fairly presenting their malpractice case against Pillsbury\u201d) (emphasis added; quotations, alterations, and citations omitted); A944 (\u201c modification  of the Plan \nis appropriate\u201d) (emphasis added); A 946 (\u201cthis Court should modify  the Plan\u201d) (emphasis added) ). \nNevertheless, \u201cthe Court will consider the substance rather than the form of the requested \nrelief.\u201d  In re Logan, 327 B.R. at 813.  As many courts have held, a \u201crequested change\u201d that \u201cis \ndirectl y contrary to the express provisions of the [p]lan\u201d constitutes a modification within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 1127(b).  In re Daewoo Motor , 488 B.R. at  425- 26 (collecting cases); see, e.g., \nNorthEast Gas Generation, 639 B.R. at 924 (party is not asking merely \u201cto interpret, clarify, or 10 fill a gap in the Plan\u201d where \u201c[t]he proposed modification is contrary to the express terms of the \nPlan\u201d); In re Planet Hollywood Int\u2019l , 274 B.R. 391, 399- 400 (Bankr. D. Del. 2001) (party seeking \n\u201crelief inconsistent with the Plan\u201d  is seeking a modification of that Plan); In re Vencor , 284 B.R. \nat 82 -85.  A change contrary to the express provisions of the Plan is precisely what  Debtors\u2019 motion \nfor relief  sought .  The Plan provides that Debtors release from any liability their \u201cattorneys . . . and \nother professionals,\u201d a category that includes  Pillsbury.  (A829- 30 (stating that \u201cDebtor Released  \nParties\u201d are \u201cconclusively, absolutely, unconditionally, irrevocably, and forever  released and \ndischarged\u201d by Debtors \u201cfrom any and all claims, interests, obligations,  suits, judgments, damages, \ndemands, debts, rights, and causes of action, losses, remedies, or liabilities whatsoever\u201d relating \n(inter alia ) to Debtors or the c hapter 11 proceedings); see A781, A793 (defining \u201cDebtor Released  \nParties\u201d to include Debtors\u2019 \u201cRelated Persons,\u201d which includes attorneys) ).  Debtors\u2019 motion seeks \nto change the release provisions of the Plan so that they no longer cover Pillsbury.  (See 5/4/2022 \nTr. at 76 -77).  Without that  modification, as Debtors ha ve acknowledged, the release provisions \nbar the malpractice claims against Pillsbury that Debtors wish to assert.  (D.I. 21 at 1 (\u201cThe Release \nProvisions preclude malpractice claims against Pillsbury\u201d); 5/4/2022 Tr. at 83-84) (\u201cIn  order to \nbring a lawsuit against Pillsbury for malpractice, debtors need to modify the  confirmation order \neffectively writing the releases and exculpation provisions out of  the order.\u201d) ). \nContrary to Debtors\u2019 argument, t he fact that they wish to modify the release provisions  to \ncarve out only one particular group of attorneys, while leaving those provisions in place as to all \nother attorneys, other  professionals, and principals, does not take Debtors\u2019 requested relief outside \nof the scope of \u00a7 1127(b).  That provision limits all plan  modifications, regardless  of the magnitude \nof the requested change.  See, e.g., NorthEast Gas Generation, 639 B.R. at 922- 24 (ruling that \nchanging a single definition in a plan constituted a  modification for purposes of \u00a7 1127); In re \nWBY , 2019 WL 3713686, at  *11.  Indeed, in a decision on which the Bankruptcy Court here relied  11 (5/4/2022 Tr. at 77-78) , a bankruptcy court in this District characterized a change in a plan\u2019s \nreleases to exclude one previously covered  party  \u2013 relief almost identical to that sought here  \u2013 as \na modification within the meaning of \u00a7 1127(b).  See In re Vencor , 284 B.R. at 85 (concluding that \n\u201cstriking the releases granted to Ventas in the Plan . . . is a modification of the Plan\u201d).   \n3. FRCP 60/FRBP 9024 Cannot Be Used to Circumvent \u00a7 1127 \nThe Bankruptcy Court further concluded that FRBP 9024 is \u201cinapplicable\u201d as a means of \ncircumventing \u00a7 1127(b)\u2019s prohibition on modification of a plan after substantial consummation.  \n(5/4/2022 Tr. at 78-80 (citing In re Logan, 327 B.R. at 812- 14)).  Debtors argue on appeal that the \nBankruptcy Court erred in determining that FRCP  60, made applicable by FRBP  9024, was \ninapplicable to Debtors\u2019 request for relief.  (D.I. 21 at 1).  The Court disagrees. \nAs the Third Circuit has explained, a rule of  procedure cannot \u201cnegate the substantive \nimpact of [a] restriction contained\u201d in a  provision of the Bankruptcy Code  or \u201cvalidly provide\u201d a \nmovant \u201cwith a substantive remedy that would be foreclosed by\u201d such a statutory provision.  In re Fesq , 153 F.3d 113, 116 -17 (3d Cir. 1998) (discussing 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2075 \n(federal bankruptcy rules cannot \u201cabridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072 (same as to federal rules of civil procedure).  A rule can do no more than \u201cdefine the \nprocess\u201d by which the substantive rights set forth in the Code can be effected.  In re Fesq , 153 F.3d \nat 116; see, e.g., Midstate Mortg. Invs., Inc., 105 F. App\u2019x 420, 423 n.4 (3d Cir. 2004); In re \nRodriguez , 521 F. App\u2019x 87, 92 (3d Cir. 2013); see also  Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers , \n485 U.S. 197, 206 (1988) (\u201c[W]hatever equitable powers remain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be exercised within the confines of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d). \nApplying that well -established principle, courts have held that  \u201c[FRCP ] 60(b) cannot be \ninvoked to bypass \u00a7 1127(b).\u201d   In re Rickel , 260 B.R. at  678.  If a debtor could modify a plan after \nsubstantial consummation under FRCP 60/ FRBP  9024, even though \u00a7 1127(b) provides that such 12 modification can occur only before substantial consummation, then the rules of procedure would \n\u201cproduce a  result at odds with the specific provisions of \u00a7 1127(b).\u201d  Id.; see Fesq , 153 F.3d at  \n116; see also, e.g., NorthEast Gas Generation, 639 B.R. at 924- 25 (neither FRCP 60 nor \nbankruptcy court\u2019s equitable powers under \u00a7 105 permit plan modification after  substantial \nconsummation to circumvent the requirements  of \u00a7 1127(b)); In re Vencor , 284 B.R. at 85; In re \nIonosphere Clubs, Inc ., 208 B.R. 812, 816- 17 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); In  re Indu Craft Inc ., 2011 WL \n2619501, at *3 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. July 1, 2011), aff\u2019d , 580 F. App\u2019x 33 (2d Cir. 2014); In re Logan, \n327 B.R. at 814-15; In re Planet Hollywood, 274 B.R. at 399; In re Daewoo  Motors , 488 B.R. at \n426-27; In re Xpedior Inc ., 354 B.R. 210, 232 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2006).  And a s Pillsbury correctly \npoints out, the refusal to permit an end run around \u00a7 1127(b) serves important interests.  Allowing \na debtor to change the terms of a plan that has already been substantially consummated would \n\u201cupset[] the legitimate expectations\u201d of the entities and individuals affected by the plan and would ultimately \u201cundermine the integrity\u201d of the bankruptcy process, as necessary players would not be willing to \u201cparticipate in reorganization if they could not feel that the plan was final.\u201d  In re Fesq , \n153 F.3d at 119 -20; see id . at 119 (explaining that \u201cCongress established finality as an important \ngoal of bankruptcy law\u201d). \n4. Authorities  Cited By Debtors Require No Different Ruling  \nThe cases cited by Debtors do not support their position that plan m odification can be \naccomplished under FRCP 60(b) even where \u00a7 1127(b) would not permit that modification.  As \nPillsbury points out, several  of those cases apply FRCP 60(b) outside of the context of plan \nmodification, s uch that \u00a7 1127(b) plays no role in the analysis .5  While a few of the other cases \n \n5  See In re Johnson & Morgan Contractors , 29 B.R. 372 (Bankr. M.D. Pa. 1983) (stipulated \norder related to lift stay); In re Lebanon Steel Foundry , 48 B.R. 520 (Bankr. M.D. Pa. 1985) \n(same); In re F.A. Potts & Co., Inc ., 86 B.R. 853, 854 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1988) (order \nauthorizing an asset sale); In re Durkalec, 21 B.R. 618, 619 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1982) (lift 13 cited by Debtors discuss FRCP 60(b) with respect to confirmation orders or plans, they do not \ndiscuss \u00a7 1127(b)  at all , and therefore do not  constitute persuasive precedent regarding whether a \nFRCP 60(b) motion is barred where \u00a7 1127(b)\u2019s limitations on plan modification are exceeded.  \nSee In re Benjamin\u2019s -Arnolds, Inc., 1997 WL 86463, at *2 (Bankr. D. Minn. Feb. 28, 1997) (plan \nmodification); In re Griffin Oil Co. , 149 B.R. 419, 421 (Bankr. E.D. Tex. 1992) (effectiveness of \nconfirmation order); In re 401 E. 89th St. Owners, Inc., 223 B.R. 75, 79 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1998) \n(same).   Debtors also cite the Whelton case, as the court distinguished the relief sought in that case  \nin the following way: \u201cThis action is not, however, an action to revoke a confirmation order, but \nrather to declare one of the provisions of a confirmed plan void.\u201d   (See D.I. 21 at 16- 17) (quoting \nWhelton v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp., 432 F.3d 150, 156 n.2 (2d Cir. 2005)  abrogated on other \ngrounds by United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260 (2010) ).  But as the Supreme \nCourt noted, that case is  contradicted by binding Third Circuit precedent ruling that FRCP 60(b) \ncannot be  used to circumvent a provision of the Bankruptcy Code.  See United Student Aid Funds, \nInc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260, 270 n.9 (2010)  (contrasting  Whelton v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp., \n432 F.3d 150, 156 (2d Cir. 2005) with In re Fesq , 153 F.3d at 119 n.8).  Finally, Debtors cite In re \nBNW,  Inc., 201 B.R. 838 (Bankr. S.D. Ala. 1996), but as Pillsbury correctly argues, that case \nconcluded that FRCP  60(b)\u2019s requirements were not satisfied and therefore never reached or \nanalyzed the interacti on between FRCP 60(b) and \u00a7 1127(b).  See id.  at 846 -47.  And t o the extent \nthat BNW could be read to suggest that FRCP 60(b) might apply even where  \u00a7 1127(b) bars relief, \nthat suggestion is inconsistent with the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling that a bankruptcy rule cannot \novercome a limitation in the  Bankruptcy Code.  See In re Fesq , 153 F.3d at 116- 17.  Finally, \nDebtors contend that In re Vencor  and In re Logan, on which the Bankruptcy Court relied in its \n \nstay order); and In re Lewis Rd., LLC , 2011 WL 6140747, at *1 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Dec. 9, \n2011) (settlement agreement under Bankruptcy Rule 9019). 14 ruling, are distinguishable .  Even assuming that is  correct, the discussion above illustrates that \nthose decisions are hardly the only ones supporting the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \u00a7 1127(b) analysis.  \n5. Debtors\u2019 Remaining Arguments Are Unavailing \nDebtors assert  that application of \u00a7 1127(b) in this case does not  serve the finality interests \nunderlying that provision, asserting that a change in the release provisions would not \u201cimpact the \nfinality of the [confirmation] order as to Debtors or its creditors.\u201d  (D.I. 21 at  19).  This Court does \nnot assess the  applicability of a statutory provision by asking whether its  overarching purposes are \ndirectly served in any particular case; rather, it looks to the  provision\u2019s plain language, and then \napplies that language by its terms.  See, e.g., Lawrence v.  City of P hila., 527 F.3d 299, 316-17 \n(3d Cir. 2008) ( \u201cexcept in the rare instance when the court determines that the plain meaning is \nambiguous,\u201d  the \u201cplain  meaning of the [statutory] text should be conclusive\u201d); see also Am. Hosp. \nAss\u2019n v. Becerra , 142 S. Ct. 1896, 1905 (2022) (court cannot adopt  \u201can interpretation that would \neviscerate . . . significant aspects of the statutory text\u201d).  The plain language of \u00a7 1127(b) admits \nof no exceptions.  Debtors further contend that they should not be held to the requirements  of \n\u00a7 1127(b) because they could not have requested relief prior to substantial consummation.  (D.I. 21 \nat 19; D.I. 25 at 7-8).  The plain text of \u00a7 1127(b) does not  provide any exception to the requirement \nthat modification must be requested before substantial  confirmation.  Congress decided  that the \ntiming requirement applies regardless of  the circumstances.  Finally, Debtors contend that the relief \nthey ask for would not violate \u00a7 1127(b) because the Plan provides that it \u201cmay be amended, \nmodified, or supplemented by the Debtors in accordance with section 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code or as otherwise permitted by law.\u201d  (D.I. 21 at  22 (citing Plan  \u00a7 11.1) ).  The Plan  provision \ndoes not advance Debtors\u2019 cause.  The Plan states that it may be modified under \u00a7 1127 or \u201cas \notherwise permitted by law.\u201d  ( Id.)  Contrary to Debtors\u2019 apparent argument, t he phrase \u201cas \notherwise permitted by law\u201d does not indicate that modification under some other authority is 15 permitted by law  \u2013 let alone under the circumstances presented here, where \u00a7 1127(b) affirmatively \nbars modification after substantial consummation.  Debtors point to no lawful means by which the \nPlan could be modified  in light of \u00a7 1127(b)\u2019s express language. \nB. Revocation of Confirmation Order Is Barred Under \u00a7 1144 \n1. Section 1144 Bars Revocation of Confirmation Order  \nDebtors further insist that they do not seek revocation here, so the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \napplication of \u00a7 1144 to their motion for relief was erroneous.  (D.I. 21 at 20).  Conversely, \nPillsbury argues that, to the extent that Debtors are not seeking to modify the Plan\u2019s release provisions, they are necessarily seeking to revoke the Confirmation Order so as to render those provisions of no force and effect as to Pillsbury.  (D.I. 22 at 33).  \u201cBecause as a matter of law there is no such thing as partial revocation of a Confirmation Order\u2019s terms, Debtors must necessarily be seeking to revoke that order in its entirety.\u201d  ( Id. (citing Rodriguez , 521 F. App\u2019x at 91-92 (a \nconfirmed plan is \u201cthe plan in all respects, and one cannot take a piece of it , and say that  the rest \nof it remains intact, therefore,  the order of confirmatio n is not disturbed.\u201d))).  Pillsbury is correct.  \nIf the release provisions are not modified and they are not revoked, then they continue to bind Debtors and bar Debtors\u2019 proposed malpractice action.  \nAs the Bankruptcy Court explained, \u201cthe debtors seek to either modify the provisions of \nthe plan to avoid the release provisions or [to] revoke the plan\u201d so as to render the release provisions of no force and effect.  (5/4/2022 Tr. at 77).  The Bankruptcy Court correctly ruled that \nrevocation is barred by the plain terms of \u00a7 1144, which provides that \u201c[o]n request of a party in interest at any time before 180 days after the date of the entry of the order of confirmation, and after notice and a hearing, the court may revoke such order if and only if such order w as procured \nby fraud.\u201d  ( Id. at 79-81 (citing  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144)).  Just as \u00a7 1127(b) is the sole means of \nmodifying a plan, \u00a7 1144 is the \u201conly means by which a confirmation order may be . . . revoked.\u201d  16 (Id. at 77- 78) (quoting In re Vencor , 284 B.R. at 87); see also In re Logan, 327 B.R. at 812-14 \n(\u00a7 1144 provides the exclusive means by which to vacate a plan\u201d) ; In re Longardne r & Assocs., \nInc., 855 F.2d 455, 460 (7th Cir. 1988)  (\u201csection 1144 is the only avenue for revoking confirmation \nof a plan of reorganization\u201d).  \nTo the extent Debtors\u2019 motion for relief can be read as a motion for revocation of the \nConfirmation Order, Debtors have not complied with the strict requirements of \u00a7 1144.  Debtors \ndid not file their motion within 180 days of confirmation .  (5/4/2022 Tr. at 81).  Debtors also have \nnot sought to revoke the confirmation order on the grounds of fraud.  ( See A927-49; A958-59).  \nSection  1144 is clear that a  court \u201cmay revoke such order if and only if such order was procured \nby fraud.\u201d  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144.  Both of those flaws are independently fatal to Debtors\u2019 motion for \nrelief .  (See 5/4/2022 Tr. at 79 (explaining that \u201cSection 1144\u2019s 180- day limitation is strictly \nenforced and may not be extended even if the fraud\u201d on which a revocation request is based \u201cis \nnot discovered until the period has passed\u201d) (citing Midstate Mortg ., 105 F. App\u2019x at 423)). \n2. FRCP 60 /FRBP 9024 Cannot Be Used to Circumvent \u00a7 1144 \nDebtors appear to contend that the Bankruptcy Court erred in ruling that FRCP  60(b) and \nFRBP 9024 cannot be used to make an end run around the strictures of \u00a7 1144.  But l ike \u00a7 1127(b), \n\u00a7 1144 cannot be circumvented by means of a  motion under FRCP 60 and FRBP 9024.  FRBP  9024 \nexpressly states that FRCP 60 applies \u201cin cases under the Code except that . . . a complaint to revoke an order confirming a plan may be filed only within the time allowed by \u00a7 1144  \n[governing revocation in Chapter 11 cases], \u00a7 1230 [governing revocation in Chapter 12 cases], or \u00a7 1330 [governing revocation in Chapter 13 cases].\u201d   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9024 (emphasis added).   \nTo the extent Debtors seek revocation of the Confirmation O rder, and they did not file their motion \nwithin the 180- day period allowed by \u00a7 1144.  By its own terms, then, FRBP 9024 cannot aid \nthem.  17 In In re Fesq , the T hird Circuit directly addresses \u00a7 1144\u2019s analog under Chapter 13 \u2013 \n\u00a7 1330, which is worded almost identically to \u00a7 1144 and provides that \u201c[o]n request of a party in \ninterest at any time within 180 days after the date of the entry of an order of confirmation . . . , the court may revoke such order if such order was procured by fraud.\u201d  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a).  In  In re  \nFesq , a creditor of a Chapter 13 debtor sought to vacate a confirmation order under FRCP 60(b) \non the basis of \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d claiming that a computer error caused the creditor\u2019s counsel to miss the deadline for filing an objection.  153 F.3d at 114-15.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat, because the motion was filed more than 180 days after confirmation, it was barred by \u00a7 1330, the Chapter 13 analog to \u00a7 1144.  Id. at 115.  The court rejected an argument that FRCP 60 allowed \nrevocation notwithstanding \u00a71330, reasoning that a procedural rule could not provide a remedy foreclosed by statute.  Id. at 116-17.  In other words, the terms of \u00a7 1330, and \u00a7 1144, mean \nprecisely what they say: the only ground for revoking a confirmation order is an allegation of fraud made within 180 days.  The Third Circuit has subsequently followed that holding in a series of \nunpublished decisions.  See, e.g., In re Rodriguez , 521 F. App\u2019x at 92; In re Midstate Mortg ., \n105 F. App\u2019x at 423 & n.4.  The Court agrees that the  Third Circuit\u2019s ruling as to the interaction \nbetween \u00a7 1330, FRCP 60, and FRBP 9024 is directly applicable to \u00a7 1144 as well.  \nDebtors argue that some courts  \u201cdisagree\u201d with the Third Circuit \u201cas to  whether a \nRule 60(b)(4) motion, which seeks relief from a judgment on the basis that the judgment is void,  \nshould be treated as a \u2018complaint to revoke\u2019 a plan subject to \u00a7 1330\u2019s time limit and substantive \nlimitation to motions based on fraud.\u201d  (D.I. 21 at  25).  This Court is, of  course, bound by the Third \nCircuit\u2019s precedential decision in  In re Fesq , whatever other courts may have rule d. \n3. Debtors\u2019 Malpractice Claims Are Not \u201cIndependent\u201d of the Plan   \nDebtors argue that \u00a7 1144 does not apply here to bar relief because proceeding with a \nmalpractice action would not \u201credivide the pie\u201d of  assets that the Plan divided but rather would 18 give Debtors a claim for some additional recovery.  (D.I. 21 at 23-25) .  Debtors rely on  two \ndecisions: In re Genesis Health Ventures, Inc. , 355 B.R. 438 (Bankr. D. Del. 2006), and In re \nCoffee Cupboard, Inc., 119 B.R. 14 (E.D.N.Y. 1990).  In those decisions, courts considered \nwhether post -confirmation damages  claims, which wer e not expressly addressed or blocked by any \nprovision in the  confirmed plan, were nevertheless so intertwined with the confirmed plan that  \nallowing the claims to proceed would be \u201ctantamount to revoking the plan.\u201d  In re Genesis , 355 \nB.R. at 445; see In re Coffee Cupboard, 119 B.R. at 18-20.  To make that  assessment, both courts \nanalyzed whether the relief sought would be tantamount to revocation because it would \u201cupset \n[the] confirmed plan\u201d in some way  \u2013 for example, by changing the way that money would be \ndistributed under the plan ( i.e., \u201credivid[ing] the pie\u201d)  \u2013 or whether the relief sought was instead \n\u201cindependent\u201d of  the plan.  In re Genesis , 355 B.R. at 444-48; see In re Coffee Cupboard, \n119 B.R.  at 18 -20.  T hat analysis has  no bearing where, as here, the confirmed Plan contains an \nexpress provision foreclosing the claims  Debtors wish to pursue.  The Bankruptcy Court correctly \nrejected this argument.   \n4. Section 1144 Contains No Exception for Purported Ethical Violations \nDebtors argue that \u00a7 1144 \u201cis not applicable to\u201d requests for  relief where purported ethical \nviolations give rise to late discovery of the basis for a request.  (D.I. 21 at  26-29).  This Court need \nnot reach any factual issues in order to affirm the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision.  The statute \ncontains no exception for purported ethical violations, and the Bankruptcy Court did not err in \ndeclining to create one out of  whole cloth.  ( See 5/4/2022 Tr. at 80-81).  Debtors insist this is a \n\u201cmatter of first impression .\u201d  (D.I. 21 at 26).  More accurately  stated , there  no authority for \nDebtors\u2019 argument that this Court should create a n exception in derogation of the statute\u2019s plain \ntext. 19 Finally, the Court  must reject s Debtors\u2019 suggestion that the Plan\u2019s release provisions as \nthey relate to Pillsbury are unusually broad or ethically improper.  (D.I. 25 at 4).  Bankruptcy \ncourts routinely approve c hapter 11 plans with release provisions substantively identical to the \nones here.  Debtors reference the \u201cspecial rule\u201d governing bilateral agreements between a lawyer \nand a client, which, among other things, requires that such agreements be made with the client\u2019s \u201cfull knowledge of all material circumstance s.\u201d  (D.I. 21 at 30 (quoting Swift v. Choe , 647 N.Y.S. \n2d 17, 20 (N.Y. App. Div. 1998)) ).  A c hapter 11 plan of reorganization is not a bilateral agreement \nbetween lawyer and client.  It is negotiated among a number of parties, subject to a court -approved \ndisclosure statement that is noticed for creditor vote and stakeholder objection, and it is reviewed and approved by a bankruptcy court.  Courts have rejected attempts to invalidate exculpatory \nprovisions in c hapter 11 plans on grounds that they violate et hical rules.  See, e.g., In re Stearns \nHoldings , LLC, 607 B.R. 781, 791 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2019) (holding that New York\u2019s rule of \nprofessional conduct restricting attorney release of malpractice liability \u201chas no bearing on the standard of care established i n an exculpation provision contained in a plan\u201d).  The Bankruptcy \nCourt correctly did the same. \nC. Due Process   \nDebtors argue that the Bankruptcy Court erred by not addressing their due process \nchallenge.  ( See D.I. 21 at  29).  Debtors did not present a due process argument in their opening \nbrief below, instead raising it only in reply.  ( See A1196-98).  Debtors argue that Pillsbury had a \nfull opportunity to address, and did in fact address, Debtors\u2019 due process argument during the May 4, 2022 hearing, and never objected to such due process argument as untimely or prejudicial.  \nSee 5/4/22 Tr. at 27-28.  The law is clear , however, that \u201c[i]ssues raised for the first time in a reply \nbrief should not be heard.\u201d  Teleconference Sys . v. Proct or & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc ., \n676 F. Supp. 2d at 331 n.13; see also In re Insys Therapeutics , 2021 WL 3083325, at *2 n.7 (noting 20 that because an argument \u201cwas not raised in the opening brief\u201d the court \u201cneed not consider it\u201d).  \nBecause the issue was n ot properly raised in Debtors\u2019 opening brief below, the Bankruptcy Court \ncommitted no error in failing to  address  it.  See Jaludi  v. CitiGroup, 933 F.3d 246, 256 n.11  \n(3d Cir. 2019) (an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief in the district co urt is forfeited ).   \nIn any event, Debtors\u2019 argument that Pillsbury\u2019s actions  somehow  deprived Debtors of \nConstitutional due process is unavailing.  (D.I. 21 at  29-37).  The due process guarantee  \u2013 whether \nderived from the Fifth Amendment or the  Fourteenth Amendment  \u2013 applies only to wrongful acts \nby government actors and has no application to \u201cprivate conduct,\u201d even if that conduct is \n\u201cdiscriminatory or  wrongful.\u201d  Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 349 (1974) (quoting \nShelley v. Kraemer , 334 U.S. 1, 13 (1948)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Warren  v. Gov\u2019t \nNat. Mortg. Ass\u2019n, 611 F.2d 1229, 1232 (8th Cir. 1980) (\u201cThe standard for  finding federal \ngovernment action under the fifth amendment is the same as that for finding state act ion under the \nfourteenth amendment\u201d).   \nPillsbury asserts  that it is a private law firm whose actions cannot give rise to a due process \nclaim.   According to Debtors, Pillsbury\u2019s \u201cprivate conduct\u201d argument is a red herring.  (D.I. 25 at \n13).  Because t he Plan containing the release provisions was confirmed by an order of  the \nBankruptcy Court , Debtors argue, \u201c it is the government, i.e., the Bankruptcy Court, depriving \nDebtors of due process .\u201d  Id .  \u201cThe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to deny Debtors even the \nopportunity to present evidence  \u2013 including an offer of proof  \u2013 demonstrates the extent of the due \nprocess denial in this case.\u201d  Id.  \nProcedural d ue process requires only that a person affected receive \u201cnotice and opportunity \nto be heard\u201d before a deprivat ion of liberty or property.  Jeannot v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth., \n356 F. Supp. 3d 440, 452 -53 (E.D. Pa. 2018); see LaChance v. Erickson, 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998) \n(\u201cThe core of due process is the  right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d).  21 Debtors had notice of their own plan of reorganization.  Debtors\u2019 principal reviewed the plan and \nsubmitted a declaration discussing and endorsing the Plan\u2019s release provisions.  (See A713- 14 \n\u00b6\u00b6 10- 14).  Debtors had many  opportunities to raise any issues they may have had with the release \nprovisions or any other aspect of the Plan, including before the confirmation hearing, at the \nconfirmation hearing, and at any time within the statutory time limit to modify the P lan.  Finally, \nDebtors had counsel other than Pillsbury with whom to discuss the release provisions.6  That \nDebtors may now wish to have  better  focused on the release provisions appl iable  to Pillsbury  \u2013 or \nthat they had more time to seek to modify the plan  \u2013 does not create a due process d eprivation. \nThe Court find s no support for Debtors \u2019 additional argument  that the Bankruptcy Court \nerred by ruling as a matter of law without an evidentiary hearing.  ( See D.I. 1 at 38- 39).  The ability \nof a court to rule as a matter of law, without trial o r a hearing, is  beyond dispute .  It is something \ncourts do every day, in granting motions for judgment on the pleadings or for summary judgment.   \nHere, the Bankruptcy Court correctly determined that Debtors\u2019 factual arguments were immaterial because their claims were untimely.  The Bankruptcy Court therefore had no need to waste time \ntaking testimony that could not change the outcome of the matter.  Debtors\u2019 argument that the \nBankruptcy Court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing (and to do so after i t had already \nconclusively ruled on the merits  of the motion based on undisputed facts) rests on an incorrect \nreading of Bankruptcy Rule  9014(d), which provides that \u201c[t]estimony of witnesses with respect \nto disputed material factual issues shall be taken in the same manner as testimony in an  adversary \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(d).  The language of that rule makes clear that  live testimony \nis needed only if the factual dispute is \u201cmaterial.\u201d  A fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if it \u201cmight affect the \n \n6  The record reflects that, in  addition to in- house attorneys  Hamed Adib and Linda Tran \n(A995- 96, A999, A1010- 97), Debtors  were represented by separate bankruptcy counsel at \nCole Schotz.  (A1245).  In addition, by no later than September 2021 (nearly two months \nbefore the Plan\u2019s effective date), Debtors  had consulted with separate counsel (LimNexus \nLPP) to advise them on potential objections to Pillsbury\u2019s fee applications.  (A1181- 86).   22 outcome\u201d of the dispute \u201cunder the  governing law.\u201d  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. \n242, 248 (1986)  (discussing materiality in the context of summary judgment).  As Debtors\u2019 motion \nwas untimely, there was no need for an evidentiary hearing, and the Bankruptcy Court was well \nwithin its discretion in  declin ing to hold one. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe Court  finds no error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s holdings, including that Debtors\u2019 \nmotion for relief sought a modification of the Plan within the meaning of \u00a7 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code, that any such modification is barred after substantial consummation, that Debtors cannot \ncircumvent the time limits  imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 1127 and 1144 by relying on FRCP 60 /FRBP 9024, and \nthat th ose statutes contain no exception s for purported ethical violations .
