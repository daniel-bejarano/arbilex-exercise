No. 21-38-LPS\nJAVON D.JACKSON,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nWHEREAS, Defendant Javon D. Jackson pled guilty to one count of possession of a\nfireann in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (see\ngenerally D.L 34);\nWHEREAS, on February 4,2022, U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services filed a final\npresentence investigation report (D.I. 43) (\"PSR\");\nWHEREAS, Jackson and the government submitted initial briefing on Jackson's\nobjections to the PSR, including his objection that Delaware's controlled substances statute is\noverbroad, such that a violation of it should not qualify as a controlled substance offense for\npurposes of the career offender enhancement in the United States Sentencing Guidelines\n(\"U.S.S.G.\" or \"Guidelines\") (see generally D.I. 42,44,46,47);\nWHEREAS, on February 11,2022, the Court heard oral argument (see Feb. 11,2022\nTr.), rejected Jackson's first overbreadth argument (see D.I. 42 at 2-5), and ordered supplemental\nbriefing on Jackson's second overbreadth argument (see id. at 5-9);\nWHEREAS, the parties submitted supplemental briefing on Jackson's second\noverbreadth argument (see generally D.I. 49, 50, 51, 52,53);\n1WHEREAS, the Court has carefully considered all the arguments presented by the parties\nin the initial and supplemental briefing, as well as their arguments dining the February\nsentencing hearing;\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, for the reasons given below,\nJackson's objection to the PSR based on his second overbreadth argument is OVERRULED.\nBecause Jackson qualifies as a career offender, the Guidelines applicable to him, and fi^om which\nthe Coiut will begin its analysis in determining an appropriate sentence, are 262 to 327 months\nimprisonment, PSRf|143-44)\n1. Under Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 (a), a defendant qualifies as a career offender if he \"has\nat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance\noffense.\" The Guidelines define a \"controlled substance offense\" as \"an offense under federal\nor state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the\nmanufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a\ncounterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or counterfeit substance) with\nintent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). To\ndetermine whether a state conviction is a qualifying predicate \"controlled substance offense,\"\ncourts employ the categorical approach or modified categorical approach and compare the state\nstatute with the generic definition in the Guidelines. See United States v. Williams, 898 F.3d\n323,333 (3d Cir. 2018).\n2. Jackson argues that his May 2017 couAdction for possession with intent to deliver\nheroin (see PSR 82-88) does not qualify as a \"controlled substance offense\" under the\nGuidelines because the schedule of controlled substances under Delaware law is broader than theschedule of federally controlled substances. (D.L 42 at 5-9) The statute Jackson pled guilty to\nviolating provides, in pertinent part, that \"any person who ... [m]anufactures, delivers, or\npossesses with the intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance in a Tier 2 quantity ...\nshall be guilty of a class C felony.\" 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4753 (2017); see also D.I 47-2. Another\nstatutory provision lists ten options for a \"Tier 2 quantity\" of a controlled substance, including \"2\ngrams or more of any morphine, opium or any salt, isomer or salt of an isomer thereof, including\nheroin, as described in \u00a7 4714 of this title, or of any mixture containing any such substance.\" 16\nDel. C. \u00a7 4751C(4)(b) (2017); see also D.I. 47-3.\n3. To advance his overbreadth argument, Jackson contends that Delaware's\ncontrolled substances statute is indivisible, as it sets out alternative means of committing the\nsame offense. {See generally D.I. 51, 52) The government, by contrast, contends that the\nstatute is divisible by drug type, meaning that the type of controlled substance is an element of\nthe offense that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. {See generally D.I. 50,\n53) The Court agrees with the government: Delaware's controlled substances statute is\ndivisible.\n4. Divisible statutes \"list elements in the alternative, and thereby define multiple\ncrimes.\" Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243,2249 (2016); see also Descamps v. United\nStates, 570 U.S. 254,262 (2013). \"The first task for a sentencing court faced with an\nalternatively phrased statute is ... to determine whether its listed items are elements or means.\"\nMathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2256. To make that determination, the sentencing court first looks at\nwhether state law characterizes the items as elements or means. Id. If a state court decision is\non point, \"a sentencing judge need only follow what it says.\" Id. Otherwise, the statute itself\"may resolve the issue.\" Id. For example, alternatives that carry different punishments are\nnecessarily elements, not means. See id. Finally, \"if state law fails to provide clear answers,\"\nthe sentencing court may look to \"the record of a prior conviction itself.\" Id. For instance, if\nan indictment or jury instructions single out a particular alternative, this suggests that the\nalternative is an element of the crime. See id. at 2257.\n5. To answer the elements-or-means question with respect to the state offense for\nwhich Jackson was convicted, 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4753(1), the Court begins its analysis with relevant\nstate court decisions. The Delaware Supreme Court has consistently treated possession with\nintent to deliver (\"PWID\") specific controlled substances as distinct crimes. For example, that\ncourt has held that \"PWID Cocaine and PWID Marijuana are two distinct offenses because each\nrequires proof of a fact that the other does not.\" Gilmore v. State, 135 A.3d 77,77 (Del. 2016);\nsee also Nance v. State, 903 A.2d 283,287 (Del. 2006) (rejecting argument that PWID Cocaine\nand PWID Marijuana involve same conduct because \"[t]he promulgation of two drug statutes is a\nclear indication that the legislature intended there to be two separate punishments for the two\nacts\"); see also Blake v. State, 65 A.3d 557, 559 (Del. 2013) (explaining that defendant was\ncharged with both PWID Cocaine and PWID Heroin). The Delaware Supreme Court's\nconsistent treatment of these crimes as distinct strongly suggests that the identity of the drug is\nan element of the crime. ^\n^ If the identity of the drug is an element of the crime, then the State must prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt, to each of the jurors, that the defendant possessed with intent to deliver (for\nexample) the same drug. A conviction could not be grovmded, for instance, in a findmg by half\nthe jurors that a defendant committed PWID Cocaine if the other half found that he committed\nPWID Heroin. On the other hand, if the identity of the drug is merely a means of violating the\nstatute, then the jury does not need to unanimously agree as to the identity of the drug in order toThe Delaware Superior Court's decision in State v. Adams, 364 A.2d 1237 (Del. Super.\nCt. 1976), supports the same conclusion. In Adams, the Court considered whether four charges\n- PWID Marijuana, PWID Methamphetamine, PWID Phencyclidine, and PWID Methaqualone,\nall of which were violations of an earlier version of 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4752 \u2014 were duplicative of one\nanother (for purposes of evaluating a double jeopardy motion). See id. at 1238. The court\nrejected the defendant's argument that \u00a7 4752 is a single offense regardless of drug type and,\nthus, declined to consolidate the four charges. See id. at 1238-40. The Court reasoned that\n\u00a7 4752's reference to \"a controlled substance\" provided \"some indication of a legislative purpose\nto make the crime apply to the individual substance rather than to the generic group\ncollectively.\" Id. at 1239.\nThe same is true for the relevant version of \u00a7 4753(1), which prohibits (among other\nthings) possession with intent to deliver \"a controlled substance.\" The Adams Court explained\nthat \u00a7 4752's \"emphasis [was] upon the substance as well as upon the act,\" unlike a statute such\nas the larceny statute, which focuses exclusively on the act and not on the identity of the stolen\nobject. See id. (\"The emphasis [in \u00a7 4752] is upon the substance as well as upon the act or\naction, the individual substance being at least as important as the act itself. This is in contrast to\nstatutes such as larceny or theft, where the thrust is the act of the illegal taking, and the\nparticularization of the item taken is secondary.\"). Likewise, the relevant version of \u00a7 4753(1)\nis intended to prohibit conduct with respect to particular substances. Thus, \"[p]roof of the\nconvict a defendant; they need merely all agree that he possessed with intent to deliver some\ncontrolled substance. In the latter instance, Jackson might have a stronger argument that the\nstate offense is broader than the generic controlled substance offense and, therefore, does not\nqualify as a predicate offense for purposes of applying the career offender enhancement.identity of the item possessed is an element of the offense,\" and an indictment under \u00a7 4753(1)\n\"must specify the drug involved.\" See id. at 1240. Although Jackson is correct that Delaware's\ncontrolled substances statute has been significantly revised since Adams was decided {see D.I. 52\nat 2), he has pointed to no indication that Delaware courts treat violations involving different\ndrugs as the same crime.^\n6. Although the state court decisions cited above are sufficient to answer the\nelements-or-means question here, in the alternative the Court tums to the language of the statute\nitself. See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2256. The statutory language leads to the same conclusion,\nalthough it does not, perhaps, compel it. The Supreme Court has explained that, \"[i]f statutory\nalternatives carry different punishments, then... they must be elements.\" Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at\n2256 (emphasis added). Consistent with this guidance, the Third Circuit has held that the\n\"statutory provision of the same punishment, regardless of which altemative was involved in a\ncrime, could indicate that the altematives are means,\" not elements. United States v. Aviles, 938\nF.3d 503,513 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added). Here, \u00a7 4753 does not provide different\npunishments for different drugs, so this principle does not conclusively establish that the identity\n^ Jackson's reliance on Kelley v. State, 222 A.3d 1043 (Del. 2019), is unpersuasive.\n{See D.I. 51 at 8) In that case, the Delaware Supreme Court made a passing reference to \"the\nelements of drug dealing under \u00a7 4753(2).\" Kelley, 222 A.3d at 1043. Because the court was\nfocused on the broader distinction between class C and class D felonies, it did not parse the\nelements of \u00a7 4753(2) like it did in the other cases cited above.\nBy contrast, the government's reliance on Delaware cases considering double jeopardy is\nentirely proper. {See D.I. 53 at 1) (\"Delaware case law has consistently held in the double\njeopardy arena that the state can charge the possession of multiple controlled substances without\nviolating double jeopardy principles - meaning that the controlled substances must be\nelements.\") These cases could not have come out the way they did (generally, finding no\nviolation of double jeopardy) if the identities of the controlled substances at issue were means as\nopposed to elements of the offenses charged.of the drug is necessarily an element of the crime; that fact alone does not, however, definitively\nestablish that the identity of the drug is just a means of committing the offense. As the\ngovernment correctly states, \"[t]he Court in Mathis did not rule that elements must have different\npunishments.\" (D.I. 50 at 5)\n7. With regard to step two, the Supreme Court has further explained that \"if a\nstatutory list is drafted to offer illustrative examples, then it includes only a crime's means of\ncommission.\" Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2256 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the drugs\nlisted in \u00a7 4751C(4) are not just \"illustrative examples\" of ways in which \u00a7 4753(1) may be\nviolated. Instead, \u00a7 4751C(4) lists the only options for weights of certain substances that qualify\nas Tier 2 quantities that may be used to convict someone of violating \u00a7 4753(1). See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Henderson, 841 F.3d 623,630 (3d Cir. 2016) (explaining that sex crimes in\ncertain Maryland statute were means because list was \"non-exhaustive\"). Thus, again, the\nstatutory language is not definitively \"means\" language and, to the contrary, appears to be\n\"elements\" language. At bottom, the statutory langiiage supports a conclusion that the identity\nof the controlled substance in \u00a7 4753(1) is an element and not a means of committing the\noffense.\n8. In any event, even if the first two steps of the analysis did not resolve the issue,\nthe third step again leads to the conclusion that the identity of the drug is an element of the\noffense of which Jackson was convicted. This is clear firom the documents the Court is\npermitted to consider. See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2256-57. That record establishes that Jackson\nwas charged with and pled guilty to dealing heroin in a Tier 3 quantity, in violation of 16 Del. C.\n\u00a7 4753(1). (D.I. 47-4) (plea agreement) If heroin were just one of many means for committingthe generic crime of possession with intent to deliver under \u00a7 4753(1), then Jackson's plea\nagreement would not have specified that his offense involved heroin. Moreover, the Delaware\nSuperior Court's model jury instructions for \u00a7 4753(1) list the identity of the drug as the first\nelement of the crime that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. (D.I. 50 Ex.\nA) (\"In order to find Defendant guilty of this charge, you must find that the State has proved the\nfollowing elements beyond a reasonable doubt: 1. The substance possessed was [drug]. ...\")\nJackson argues that the Third Circuit has \"criticized the use of jury instructions to answer the\nquestion of whether a specific controlled substance is a means or an element.\" (D.I. 52 at 4)\n(citing Hillocks v. Attorney General, 934 F.3d 332 (3d Cir. 2019)) In Hillocks, however, the\ngovernment's argument regarding jury instructions was inconsistent with an earlier Third Circuit\ndecision. See 934 F.3d at 342-43. There is no such inconsistency here. Moreover, under the\nrelevant jury instructions in/fiV/ocfo', the judge could allow the jurors to choose between\ndifferent facts as the basis for their verdict. See id. at 343. Here, the model jury instmctions\nfor \u00a7 4753(1) appear to require the government to prove to all the jurors that the defendant\npossessed a particular drug, not just one of multiple possible drugs. (See D.I. 50 Ex. A)^\n9. The Court's conclusion that \u00a7 4753(1) is divisible by drug type is further\nsupported by Henderson. In Henderson, 841 F.3d at 625, the Third Circuit held that\nPennsylvania's controlled substances statute is divisible by drug type for purposes of\n^ Jackson relies on Patterson v. State, 925 A.2d 504 (Del. 2007), for the proposition that\n\"[t]he identity of [the] controlled substance appears as a means of committing the criminal\noffense\" because the government need not prove the identity of the controlled substance. (See\nD.I. 52 at 1-2) The Delaware model jury instructions belie Jackson's premise regarding what\nthe government must prove.detennming whether a violation qualifies as a \"serious drug offense\" under the Armed Career\nCriminal Act.'' The Pennsylvania statute prohibits certain activities with respect to \"Schedule I\nor II\" drugs, as defined in a related statutory provision. Id. at 626-27. Applying the three-step\nframework from Mathis, the Third Circuit first noted that decisions of the Pennsylvania Superior\nCourt treat the identity of the drug as an element of the crime. See id. at 628-29. Next, the\nThird Circuit explained that, by cross-referencing Schedule I and II, the language of the statute\nitself creates \"several alternative elements,\" \"not separate means of commission.\" Id. at 630.\nHence, the Pennsylvania statute provides a \"clear answer\" to the elements-or-means question\nbecause it \"provides an exhaustive list of all specific controlled substances\" and \"does not\nattempt to illustrate the different means of carrying out the offense - i.e., the countless ways\npeople may manufacture, distribute, or possess the specified controlled substances.\" Id. at 630-\n31. Lastly, the Third Circuit noted that the docxunents in the record confirmed that the\ndefendant was charged with and convicted of possessing a particular drug (heroin). See id. at\n631-32. For all the reasons explained above, the Third Circuit's reasoning in Henderson applies\nhere and supports the Court's conclusions.'\n^ See also United States v. Miller, 480 F. Supp. 3d 614,618 n.3 (M.D. Pa. 2020)\n(\"Because [35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7] 780-113(a)(30) is divisible by drug type, we reject [the\ndefendant]'s broader argument that a mismatch between the state and federal schedules renders\nSection 780-113(a)(30) - as a whole - categorically overbroad.\").\n' The Court acknowledges the Second Circuit has held that a provision in New York's\ncontrolled substances statute is not divisible by drug type, so a violation of it cannot qualify as an\n\"aggravated felony\" that might bar someone from seeking cancellation of removal and asylum\nunder the immigration laws. See Harbin v. Sessions, 860 F.3d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 2017); see also\nUnited States v. Townsend, 897 F.3d 66,74 (2d Cir. 2018) (reaffirming indivisibility of New\nYork statute in context of sentencing enhancement). Unlike the Third Circuit decisions cited in\nthis Memorandum Order, Harbin and Townsend are not bmdmg on this Court (even assuming\nthe New York statute is fairly analogous to the Delaware statute).10. Because Delaware's controlled substances statute is divisible by drug type, the\nCourt applies the modified categorical approach to determine whether Jackson's conviction\nimder the Delaware statute qualifies as a controlled substance offense under U.S.S.G.\n\u00a7\u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and 4B1.2(b). See Descamps, 570 U.S. at 257 (explaining modified categorical\napproach). Having undertaken this analysis, the Court concludes that Jackson's predicate\nconviction rmder 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4753(1) is no broader than the Guidelines' definition of a generic\ncontrolled substance offense. In arguing the opposite, Jackson points to (among other things) a\n\"catch all\" provision in \u00a7 4751C(4)(h), which criniinalizes conduct involving \"substance[s] as\ndescribed in \u00a7 4714,\" \"designer drug[s] as described in \u00a7 4701(9),\" and \"any mixture\" containing\nany of those substances. (See D.I. 42 at 5; Feb. 11,2022 Tr. at 10) Jackson was not, however,\ncharged with and convicted of possessing a designer drug or otherwise violating this \"catch all\"\nprovision. (See D.I. 47-4) Jackson was charged with and pled guilty to possessing heroin with\nthe intent to deliver it, an offense which is no broader than a generic controlled substance\noffense. Thus, Jackson's overbreadth argument lacks merit.\n11. In svun, Jackson's argxunents do not provide a meritorious basis for his objections\nto the presentence investigation report. Because possession with intent to deliver heroin under\n16 Del. C. \u00a7 4753(1) (2017) is a \"controlled substance offense\" within the meaning of the U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines, Jackson's PSR properly determined that Jackson qualifies as a career\noffender. He will be sentenced as such.\nMarch 8,2022 HONORABLE LEONARD P. STARK\nWilmington, Delaware UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n10"}
