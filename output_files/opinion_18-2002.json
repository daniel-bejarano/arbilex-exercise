Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 1 of 15 PageID #: 54542 When an illegal  bet is made  on how long a person  will live , Delaware law dictates  \nthat any profit s from that bet go to the person\u2019s loved ones.  Though there might be \nsome exceptions to that rule, none applies here.  \nA group of related companies, which I collectively call Coventry,  used life insur-\nance to bet on the lifespan of Beverly Berland . To start, Coventry facilitated buying  \nan insurance policy on her life. While  the insurance company could still contest the \npolicy , it was held by a trust that Coventry helped create . Once the policy was in the \nclear, Coventry bought  it and  then  resold it to Lavastone, the defendant here. When \nBerland died, Lavastone got a $5 million  payout . That money must go to Berland\u2019s \nEstate.  \nI. THE LIFE-INSURANCE WAGER  \nThe facts are complex , involving  a cast of Coventry companies, a nonrecourse loan , \na trust, a sub -trust, an underwriter, a bank, and a broker . Before diving  into the \ndetails, it will help  to paint with a broad brush. Beverly Berland learned that she \ncould make money by taking out a n unneeded  life-insurance policy and then selling \nit. D.I. 113 \u00b6 \u00b6 20\u201322, 28 \u201332; D.I. 92 -13 at 6 \u20137. Rather than pay the premiums  out of \npocket , she funded them  with  a loan secured by the policy itself. D.I. 113 \u00b6\u00b6  37, 40. \nThat loan was administered by a Coventry company. Id. \u00b6 33\u201335. When the loan  came \ndue, Berland  sold the policy to another Coventry company. Id. \u00b6 56. Because the sale \nprice was more than the amount outstanding on the loan, she made a tidy sum , just \nas she had hoped.  Id. \u00b6 56. Meanwhile, the Coventry company  turned around and  \nresold Berland\u2019s  policy to Lavastone , the defendant here. Id. \u00b6 57.  Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 2 of 15 PageID #: 54553 Now , on to a more detailed account of the facts, over which I find no genuine dis-\npute: \n1. Lavastone and Coventry enter into an origination agreement.  In 2001, Lavastone \nsigned an origination agreement with Coventry First . Id. \u00b6 3. Coventry First would \nsell Lavastone life -insurance policies  that had entered  the secondary market. Id. \nThese policies had to meet certain criteria. For example, the insured had to be \nsixty  years or older , with a remaining life expectancy of fifteen  years or less. Id. \u00b6 5. \nAnd the policy had to be past the two -year contestability period, meaning the insur-\nance company could not challenge  its validity . Id. Lavastone bought  many life -insur-\nance policies through this agreement, including Berland \u2019s. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 57. \n2. Berland connects  with Simba.  In 2006, Berland , then in her mid -seventies,  met \nwith a company called Simba. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 28; D.I. 94-1 at 89. Simba  helped senior citi-\nzens make money by buying  \u201cexcess (unwanted, not needed) life insurance\u201d and then \nselling it on the se condary market. D.I. 113 \u00b6  20. Clients did not need to put down  \nany of their own money . Instead, Simba helped them get nonrecourse loans to finance \nthe policy premiums . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25. That means the life -insurance polic ies themselves  \nwere the only collateral  for these loans . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 41.  \nBerland wanted in. After being assured that she faced no financial risk, she took \nout multiple life -insurance policies , including a Lincoln Benefit Life policy with a \n$5 million death benefit . Id. \u00b6 32. Compare  D.I. 87 \u00b6  3, with D.I. 108 \u00b6  3. That  policy \nis the only one at  issue . Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 3 of 15 PageID #: 54564 3. Simba helps  Berland  get a Coventry -administered loan. To take out  the policy, \nBerland needed to get a loan to pay for it. So Simba arranged for a nonrecourse loan \nfrom LaSalle Bank . D.I. 113 \u00b6\u00b6 33, 37. To get that loan, Simba first sent Berland\u2019s \nmedical records to Coventry Capital. Id. \u00b6 33. Coventry Capital was the lending -pro-\ngram administrator for LaSalle . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35. Coventry Capital then sent Berland\u2019s \nmedical records to Coventry Servicing, whi ch produced a report on Berland\u2019s life ex-\npectancy. Id. \u00b6 34. In turn, Coventry Servicing sent that report to Lexington, an un-\nderwriter. Id. Once Lexington agreed to insure the loan, LaSalle issued it. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7, \n15, 3 4, 40. \n4. Berland signs the  Coventry loan package , creating a trust. Meanwhile , Coventry \nCapital, as program administrator for LaSalle, sent Berland a standard loan package. \nId. \u00b6 35. By signing that package, Berland created a Delaware trust called the \u201cBer-\nland Insurance Trust .\u201d Id. \u00b6 36. The Trust  would apply for and own Berland\u2019s life -\ninsurance policy. Id. It would also be the policy\u2019s beneficiary. Id. \u00b6 44. \nThe trustee was Wilmington Trust.  Id. \u00b6 36. Berland\u2019s life partner, Murray  Rof-\nfeld, was the co -trustee and beneficial owner. Id. The Trust was established with a \n$1 contribution  (which Berland did not pay ). Id. A sub -trust of the Trust was the bor-\nrower on the nonrecourse loan. Id. \u00b6 37. As part of the loan package, Berland also \nexecuted  a \u201cspecial irrevocable durable power of attorney .\u201d Id. \u00b6 42. This authorized \nCoventry Capital to \u201coriginat[e] and  or servic[e] any life insurance policies insuring \n[her] life.\u201d Id. Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 4 of 15 PageID #: 54575 5. Berland buys  life insurance through the Trust. Simba then sent an application \nfor the Lincoln policy to Coventry Capital. Id. \u00b6 45. That application falsely stated \nthat Berland had $10  million in assets and $180,000 in annual income. Id. \u00b6 47. In \nreality , Berland had $1.5 to $2  million  in assets  and a n annual income of about \n$40,000.  Id. \u00b6 30. Coventry Capital forwarded Berland\u2019s  application to Wilmington \nTrust. Id. \u00b6 49. Wilmington Trust signed the application in Delaware as the Trust\u2019s \ntrustee and policy owner. Id. Lincoln then delivered the policy  to Wilmington Trust\u2019s \nDelaware address . Id. \u00b6 51. Simba split its commission  on the policy  with Coventry . \nId. \u00b6 52.  \n6. Coventry buys the Berland policy and resells it to Lavastone.  Three months be-\nfore the nonrecourse loan came due, Coventry First and Lavastone did a \u201cpre -offer\u201d \nreview of the Berland policy as part of their origination agreement. Id. \u00b6 53. If \nLavastone was willing to  buy the policy, Coventry Firs t would try to get it. Id. \nCoventry Capital, as LaSalle\u2019s servicing agent, then sent Berland a reminder to \npay off the nonrecourse loan or relinquish the policy. Id. \u00b6 55. Berland controlled \nwhether and to whom the policy  could be sold . Compare  D.I. 87 \u00b6  17, with D.I. 108 \n\u00b6 17. Indeed, Berland signed engagement letters with three separate life -insurance  \nbrokers. Compare  D.I. 87 \u00b6  18, with D.I. 108 \u00b6  18. But she ultimately sold the policy \nto Coventry First for $453,822.88. D.I. 113 \u00b6  56. She then used the proceeds to pay off \nthe loan. Id. In the en d, Berland was left with a profit of $73,594.05. Id. \n7. Lavastone gets the death benefit . Lavastone immediately bought  the policy from \nCoventry First for $681,471, according to their preexisting origination agreement. Id. Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 54586 \u00b6 57. When Berland passed away in 2015, Lavastone got the $5 million payout . Id. \n\u00b6 58.  \nBerland\u2019s Estate sued  under 18 Del. C. \u00a7 2704(b) to recover the money . D.I. 44 \n\u00b6\u00b6 74\u201382. The parties now  cross -move  for summary judgment.  \nII. THE LAW OF STRANGER -ORIGINATED  LIFE INSURANCE  \nA. Delaware law applies  \nFirst, I confirm that Delaware law applies. Lavastone makes a passing sug gestion  \nthat Florida law governs because of a conformity clause in the life -insurance policy. \nD.I. 123 at 6. But a \u201cconformity clause  alone  is not a choice  of law provision. \u201d Stillwa-\nter Mining Co. v. Nat\u2019l  Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. , 2021 WL 6068046, at \n*10 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 22, 2021) . Though a single clause could operate as both,  the \nlanguage must be \u201cplain and clear.\u201d Id. Here, it is not. The clause is labeled \u201c Con-\nformity with State Law \u201d and provides only that the insurer will treat the policy as if \nit complie s with the \u201claws of the state where the application was signed.\u201d D.I. 113 \n\u00b6 50. Indeed, the very case that Lavastone  relies  on for support  found  that a similar \nclause in another Lincoln life -insurance policy was not a choice -of-law provision. See \nAEI Life LLC v. Lincoln Benefit Life Co. , 892 F.3d 126, 13 2\u201335 (2d Cir. 2018) . And \nsince  both the Trust and Lavastone are in  Delaware , I apply Delaware law . \nB. Delaware bans betting on someone\u2019s life  \nLike many jurisdictions, Delaware has outlawed  gambling on human lives. PHL \nVariable Ins. Co. v. Price Dawe 2006 Ins. Tr., 28 A.3d 1059, 1070 \u201371 (Del. 2011); Del. \nConst. art.  II, \u00a7  17. To make sure life insurance is not used to evade that ban, Dela-\nware requires that a life -insurance policy have an insurable interest at the start . Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 6 of 15 PageID #: 54597 Price Dawe , 28 A.3d at 1071 \u201373; 18 Del. C. \u00a7 2704(a ). In other words , the beneficiary \nof the  policy must \u201cexpect some benefit or advantage\u201d  from the continued life of the \ninsured . Price Dawe , 28 A.3d at 1069  (internal quotation marks omitted) . \nPolicies that have an insurable interest  are valid and can be legally sold on the \nsecondary market. Id. at 1069 \u201370. But those that lack such an interest at the start  \nare void ab initio . Id. at 1067 \u201368. Such policies, commonly known as \u201cstranger origi-\nnated  life insurance\u201d (STOLI), violate 18 Del. C. \u00a7 2704(a). Id. at 1073 \u201374. And \n\u00a7 2704(b) lets the insured\u2019s estate recover any  death benefit  paid on a STOLI  policy . \nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Est. of Malkin , 278 A.3d 53, 56 (Del. 2022).  \nThere is one exception to the insurable -interest requirement: the insured herself \ncan take out life insurance on her own life for the benefit of  anyone. 18 Del. C. \n\u00a7 2704(a); Price Dawe , 28 A.3d at 1073 \u201374. So that  this exception  is not used to facil-\nitate a STOLI scheme, Delaware scrutinizes who in fact  took out  the policy. Price \nDawe , 28 A.3d at 1075 \u201376. If a third  party used  the insured as an \u201cinstrumentality \nto procure a policy that, when issued, would otherwise lack an insurable interest,\u201d \nthe policy is void. Id. at 1074.  \nC. The Delaware Supreme Court has answered my certified que stions  \nTo better understand how Delaware law applies to the dispute  here, I certified \nthree questions to the Delaware Supreme Court. The Court has answered those  ques-\ntions. Lavastone Cap. LLC v. Est. of Berland , 266 A.3d 964 (Del. 2021) . I am grateful \nfor its help.  \nFirst, I asked the Court whether a death -benefit payment on a  void policy is made \n\u201cunder any contract\u201d under  18 Del. C. \u00a7 2704(b) . The Court said yes.  Berland , 266 Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 54608 A.3d at 969\u201371. This means that if Berland\u2019s policy was void, her Estate can recover \nthe death benefit.  \nSecond, I asked whether Delaware law forbids an insured (or her trust) to take \nout a policy on her own life using a nonrecourse loan and, after the contestability \nperiod, sell it to someone without an insurable interest, if she never intended to main-\ntain insurance coverage beyond the contestability period. The Court said no, so long \nas (1) \u201cthe use of nonrecourse funding did not allow the insured or  \u2026 her trust to \nobtai n the policy \u2018without actually paying the premiums\u2019  \u201d and (2) \u201cthe insured or \u2026 \nher trust procured or effected the policy in good faith, for a lawful insurance purpose, \nand not as a cover for a wagering contract.\u201d Id. at 97 1\u201373 (quoting Price Dawe , 28 \nA.3d at  1076).  \nFinally,  I asked whether an estate may profit under \u00a7 2704(b) if an insurance pol-\nicy in violation of \u00a7 2704(a) was procured in part by the decedent\u2019s fraud and the de-\ncedent profited from the previous sale of the policy. The Court said yes, a n estate may \nstill profit \u201cif the recipient of the death  benefits cannot establish that it was a victim \nof the fraud.\u201d Id. at 973\u201375. And it reasoned that Lavastone cannot establish that it \nwas such a victim. Id. In its most recent brief, Lavastone appears to have  drop ped \nthat argument. See generally  Lavastone Supp l. Br., D.I. 168 . \nWith that helpful guidance in mind, I turn to the parties\u2019 cross -motions for sum-\nmary judgment.  \nIII. LAVASTONE HAS NO RIGHT TO KEEP THE DEATH BENEFIT  \nSummary judgment is appropr iate if there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any mate-\nrial fact\u201d and the moving party \u201cis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 8 of 15 PageID #: 54619 Civ. P.  56(a). The moving party has the burden of proof. Nat\u2019l State Bank v. Fed. Rsrv. \nBank of N .Y., 979 F.2d 1579, 15 81 (3d Cir. 1992) . \nA. Lavastone is not collaterally estopped from litigating whether the \npolicy was void  from the start  \nBerland\u2019s Estate says Lavastone\u2019s  defense of the policy\u2019s validity can be nipped in \nthe bud: Lavastone , it claims,  was the real party of interest in prior lawsuits that \ndeclared void other policies funded  under the same Coventry -administered loan . Ber-\nland Op. Br., D.I. 89 at 19 \u201320. So, the Estate says,  Lavastone is collaterally estopped \nfrom litigating whether the Berland policy is void . Id. \nBut to determine whether a policy is void, courts must \u201cscrutinize the circum-\nstances under which [it] was issued .\u201d Price Dawe , 28 A.3d at 1076. The ci rcumstances \nhere necessarily differ from those under which other policies were issued to other \npeople. So this case does not present the \u201csame issue\u201d as past cases, and Lavastone is \nnot barred from litigating the policy \u2019s validity . 18 C harles Alan Wright, A rthur \nR. Miller & E dward H . Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure  \u00a7 4417 (3d ed.  2022 ). \nB. The policy lacked an insurable interest and was void  from the start  \nTo decide whether the policy is void, I apply the two -pronged  test that the  Dela-\nware  Supreme Court  set out in answering my certified question s. When a policy is \npaid for with a nonrecourse loan and the insured always intended to sell it at the \nclose of the contestability period, it is void  if either (1) the nonrecourse loan let the \ninsured (or her trust) get the policy without \u201cactually paying the premiums, \u201d or (2) the \ninsured (or her trust) took out  the policy in bad faith, \u201cas a cover for a wagering con-\ntract. \u201d Berland , 266 A.3d at 966. Berland\u2019s policy fails both prongs  and is thus void . Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 546210 1. Funding . First, not a penny of the premium payments came out of Berland\u2019s \npocket. D.I. 92 -13 at 6. Instead, she used a loan administered by Coventry to fund \nthem. D.I. 113 \u00b6\u00b6  33\u201335, 40. And as soon as the loan came due, she sold the policy  to \nCoventry , using the proceeds to repay the loan.  Id. \u00b6 56. \nLavastone says that Berland , not Coventry,  paid the premiums  because she \u201chad \na bona fide obligation to repay \u201d the loan  and did, in fact, repay . D.I. 168 at 6. But \nBerland\u2019s obligation was  illusory ; she had no skin in the game . The policy was the \nonly collateral for the nonrecourse loan. If she could not  pay off the loan  when it came \ndue, she could have relinquished the policy and walked away. Plus, during the two \nyears that she had the loa n, she never made any payments. Compare D.I. 113 \u00b6  40, \nwith id.  \u00b6 56. When she finally did repay it , all that money came straight from Cov-\nentry , which had facilitated the loan in the first place.  Id. \u00b6 56. \nLavastone  also says that Berland paid the premiums in that  she \u201cused a common \nfinancing option.\u201d D. I. 168 at 6.  True, nonrecourse funding is a permissible way to \npay for life insurance. Berland , 266 A.3d at 972 . But such funding can also be \u201cevi-\ndence of an impermis sible STOLI scheme, especially [when it] means that a third \nparty, and not the insured, bears the entire financial liability for obtaining the pol-\nicy.\u201d Id. That was what happened here: third  parties , not Berland, shouldered  all the \nliability . Cf. id. at 972 n.27 ( when life insurance is funded by a nonrecourse loan for \na legal tax purpose, the insured still makes payments on the loan).   \n2. Bad faith.  Nor did Berland take out  the policy for a valid insurance purpose. \nBerland  did not need life insurance. D.I. 113 \u00b6  31. Her children were adults. D.I. 94 -Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 546311 3 at 66. Though  she lived with  Roffeld,  her life partner , she did not pay his expenses. \nD.I. 113 \u00b6  29. And no one at Simba  ever spoke with Berland about using life insurance \nto mitigate risk or reduce  her estate tax es. D.I. 92 -13 at 6.   \nRather, Berland took out  the policy as a cover for a wagering contract , and the \npolicy\u2019s real procurer was Coventry. Coventry had a preexisti ng arrangement to sell \nsenior citizens\u2019 life-insurance policies  to Lavastone . D.I. 113 \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20135. To do so, it \nneeded inventory . Berland fit the bill , so Coventry helped her get insurance . At the \noutset, Coventry  facilitated the nonrecourse loan that Berland  used to pay the policy \npremiums during the contestability  period . For example, Coventr y collected her \nhealth records and generated the life -expectancy report necessary  to secure the loan.  \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 33\u201334. It also administered the loan . Id. \u00b6 35. \nBut Coventry\u2019s involvement did not end there.  Coventry had Berland execute a \n\u201cspecial irrevocable durable power of attorney,\u201d which let Coventry originate and ser-\nvice insurance policies on Berland\u2019s life. Id. \u00b6 42. It also facilitated  creating  the trust  \nthat would own Berland\u2019s life -insurance policy. Id. \u00b6 36. And it collected the life in-\nsurance application from Berland and sent it to the  trust  to sign. Id. \u00b6 45\u201349. \nDuring the policy\u2019s two-year contestability period , Coventry lay in wait. Then, as \nthat period wound down  and the loan neared  maturity , Coventry prepared  to harvest  \nits reward . It asked  Lavastone to consider buying  Berland\u2019s policy . Id. \u00b6 53. Lavastone \nsaid yes , so Coventry set out to get it. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 53\u201356. Although Berland controlled \nwhether and to whom she sold the policy, she ultimately sold it to Coventry.  Id. \u00b6 53. \nCoventry\u2019s role in the origination  of Berland\u2019s  life-insurance  policy  and later purchase Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 11 of 15 PageID #: 546412 of that policy shows that Coventry, not Berland, procured it. So it is void. Indeed, \nother courts have come to the same conclusion about policies funded through the \nsame Coventry -administered  loans . See Est. of Malkin v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , 379 \nF. Supp. 3d 1263 (S.D. Fla. 2019), aff\u2019d in relevant part , 2022 WL 2285884 (11th Cir. \nJune 23, 2022); Sun Life Assurance Co. Can . v. U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n , 369 F. Supp. \n3d 601, 606 (D. Del. 2019); U.S. Bank  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Can ., \n2016 WL 8116141 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2016),  report and recommendation adopted , \n2017 WL 347449 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2017) . \nLavastone\u2019s efforts to avoid that conclusion here are unavailing. Lavastone asserts \nthat B erland had a valid insurance purpose. First, it notes  that Berland signed a form \nsaying  she was buying  the policy \u201cto meet a need for life insurance.\u201d D.I. 168 at 7. But \ntechnical compliance is insufficient. The very purpose of a STOLI scheme is to \u201cfeign \ntechnical compliance.\u201d Price Dawe , 28 A.3d at 1074. So even though  Coventry  made \nsure to have Berland dot her i\u2019s and cross  her t\u2019s, Lavastone must point to something \nmore . \nLavastone also says that the policy gave  Berland life insurance during the con-\ntestability period. If Berland had died during that time, Roffeld, her life partner , \nwould have received the payout as beneficiary of the trust  that owned the policy . But \nLavastone does not identify any evidence  that B erland\u2019s purpose in buying  the policy \nwas to give Roffeld  short -term insurance protection . Cf. Berland , 266 A.3d at 973.  It \ndoes not explain  why Roffeld need ed the $5 million . D.I. 168 at 7 \u20138. On the contrary, \nit acknowledges  that Roffeld \u201cpaid for his and Berland\u2019s expenses.\u201d D.I. 113 \u00b6  29. In Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 12 of 15 PageID #: 546513 fact, though Lavastone has since pivoted, it originally admitted  that Berland \n\u201cwanted\u201d life -insurance policies \u201cso that she could sell them for money.\u201d Id. \u00b6 31. \nLavastone\u2019s  new,  unsupported  assertion that Berland wanted to \u201cprovid[e] short term \ninsurance protection to her loved ones in the even t of her death\u201d  falls flat . D.I. 168 at \n7. \nC. Lavastone\u2019s defenses fail \nTrying to keep the death benefit,  Lavastone scrapes togeth er eleven defenses. D.I. \n45 \u00b6\u00b6  117\u2013129. Some are dead on arrival . In answering our certified questions, the \nDelaware Supreme Court nixed Lavastone\u2019s  in pari delicto  and unclean -hands de-\nfenses.  Berland , 266 A.3d at 974. And in a similar case, it held that as a matter of \nlaw, a bona -fide-purchaser defense is unavailable if an insurance contract is void . \nMalkin , 278 A.3d at 56.  \nBut other  common -law defenses and counterclaims  can remain available . Courts \nmust  \u201clook to [their]  elements\u201d and \u201c where appropriate, the public policy underlying \nthe ban on human -life wagering .\u201d Id. at 62 \u201363. Here, though, n one of Lavastone\u2019s \ndefenses applies . \n1. Lavastone\u2019s contract -based defenses fail.  Lavastone asserts various defen ses \nbased on the contract  that Berland and her trust signed when selling the policy to \nCoventry. But that contract was used to effect a STOLI scheme. So it is void for the \nsame reason the insurance policy  is: it \u201cviolates Delaware\u2019s clear public policy aga inst \nwagering.\u201d Price Dawe , 28 A.3d at 1067 \u201368. Thus, none of the contract\u2019s  provisions \n\u201cever legally came into effect ,\u201d and I cannot enforce them. Id. Nor can estoppel be Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 546614 used to resuscitate a void contract . See Waggoner v. Laster , 581 A.2d 1127, 1137 (Del. \n1990); see also  Price Dawe , 28 A.3d at 1067.  \n2. Lavastone\u2019s other defenses fail. Lavastone \u2019s remaining defenses fare no better. \nFirst,  Lavastone says that Berland ratified the sale of her insurance policy because \nshe \u201ctreated th e sale as valid and enjoyed [its] benefits.\u201d D.I. 91  at 18. But \u201ca \ndecedent -insured\u2019s mere sale of the policy at a profit does not bar an estate\u2019s claim \nunder Section  2704(b).\u201d Berland , 266 A.3d at 975. \nLavastone also says that laches applies because  the Estate\u2019s claim comes too late. \nD.I. 91 at 18. Berland, Lavastone  complains, never acted to repudiate  the sale of her \npolicy while she was alive. Id. But the claim asserted here did not exist until after \nBerland\u2019s death. See 18 Del. C. \u00a7 2704(b)  (providing  a cause of action to recover bene-\nfits \u201caccruing upon the death \u2026 of the individual\u201d).  The Estate cannot be faulted for \nwaiting  to bring a claim that had yet to materialize.  \nLavastone\u2019s unjust -enrichment claim fails  too. Lavastone may have conferred ben-\nefits upon the Estate by paying the premiums and thus keeping the policy in force. \nBut it did so officiously . Malkin , 278 A.3d at 69\u201370. There are no allegations of coer-\ncion or request. And though Lavastone may have paid the premiums under the mis-\ntaken belief that it \u2014rather than the Estate \u2014would get the $5  million death benefit, \nthat is not the sort of mistake that gives rise to a cl aim for unjust enrichment. Cf. \nMetcap Secs. LLC v. Pearl Senior Care, Inc ., 2009 WL 513756, at *10 n.59 (Del. Ch. \nFeb. 27, 2009), aff\u2019d, 977 A.2d 899 (Del. 2009) ( holding that a company\u2019s mistaken \nbelief that it would be compensated for its services  is not the sort of mistake covered Case 1:18-cv-02002-SB-SRF   Document 173   Filed 09/28/22   Page 14 of 15 PageID #: 546715 by unjust enrichment). Finally, Lavastone\u2019s recoupment defense simply  restate s its \nunjust -enrichment defense and fails for the same reason.  \n* * * * * \nLavastone took a  risk when it agreed to buy senior citizens\u2019 life-insurance policies  \nfrom Coventry . That risk does not pay off here.  Berland\u2019s policy was void  from the \nstart . And Lavastone cannot satisfy the elements of the defenses it asserts. So I grant  \nthe Estate\u2019s  motion for partial summary jud gment and deny Lavastone\u2019s motion for \nsummary judgment.  I dismiss as moot the Estate\u2019s alternative cause of action for \nunjust enrichment and direct the Clerk to close this case.
