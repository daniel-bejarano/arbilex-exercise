Schwartz, G IBSON DUNN, Washington, District of Columbia ; \nHannah Regan- Smith, Jessica Brown, GIBSON DUNN, Denver, Colorado.  \n \nCounsel for Defendants . \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nDecember  13, 2021 \n \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nNo one should suffer ra ce or sex  discrimination  at work . But not all offensive re-\nmarks are discriminatory. Employees must put up with some trials and tribulations \nin the workplace.  \nEmily Sousa is no different. She says Amazon treat ed her less favorably than \nother employees and forc ed her to endure a hostile workplace. She also alleges that \nher supervisors  retaliated against her when she reported discrimination . But the de-\ntails in her complaint belie those  serious allegations. At root, Sousa identifies only a \nfew offensive remarks from one supervisor and several personal  phone calls from an-\nother. That does not amount to discrimination, so her claims  fail. \nI. BACKGROUND  \nAfter college, Sousa became  a shift manager at Amazon. D.I. 14 \u00b6 2. But her tran-\nsition to the workforce was rough . A male manager  soon compared her to an adult \nactress and told her that \u201cwom en are too delicate to work at Amazon.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 31. \nUnderstandably, she reported this  and r esigned. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 31\u221236. Unwilling to lose her, \nAmazon offered to reinstate her and  transfer her  from New Jersey to Delaware. Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 5, 36. Sousa accepted ; she had a fresh  start.  \nBut it did not  take long for things to go wrong again. Sousa alleges that Lawrence \nDorsey, a manager at the Delaware site , who later became her supervisor,  \u201cquickly \nmade [her] the target of constant harassment.\u201d Id. \u00b6 7. On her first day, Dorsey \nphoned  Sousa and talked with her for \u201cnearly an hour.\u201d Id. \u00b6 43. Even though Dorsey 3 did not directly supervise Sousa, he  continued to call  her to talk about his  personal \nlife, haircuts, girlfriends, and vacation plans. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 67\u221295.  \nDorsey\u2019s  calls  made Sousa uncomfortable. See, e.g., id. \u00b6\u00b6 75, 77. She claims that \nhe would steer their conversations toward Sousa\u2019s Japanese heritage and noticed  that \nhe occasionally mention ed racial stereotypes. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 71\u221273. For instance, he told her \nthat he thought Japanese people were \u201cpolite and non -confrontational,\u201d mentioned \nhis interest in Japanese cartoons, and invited Sousa to be his \u201ctravel guide\u201d should \nhe ever go to Japan. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 72\u221273. These references made Sousa uneasy because  \nDorsey had a reputation for being a \u201ccreep\u201d with  a particular interest in women from \nAsia. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 78\u221280, 99.  \nThen, Amazon temporarily reassigned Sousa to a facility in New Jersey . It said \nher transfer was  to cover a holiday -season staffing shortage. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 111\u221219. She al-\nleges that Dorsey was behind this decision and was retaliating against her for spurn-\ning his advances. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 120, 123. Sousa was particularly unhappy because she was \nexpected to fill in as a line worker, not as a manager.  Id. \u00b6 125.  \nWhen Sousa returned  from New Jersey, she took a leave of absence. Id.  \u00b6 137. She \nalso contacted HR about Dorsey. She told them that she was afraid to file a complaint \nagainst hi m, but nonetheless agreed to proceed with an investigation.  Id. \u00b6 139. Ulti-\nmately, HR concluded that Sousa\u2019s allegations lacked evidence. Id. \u00b6 147.  \nAfter the investigation, Sousa asked to transfer to another facility to get away \nfrom Dorsey . Amazon responded  that she would have to return to work be fore it could 4 process her transfer.  Id. \u00b6 149. Unwilling to do that, Sousa quit to accept a new job at \na different Amazon- owned company. Id. \u00b6 152.  \nShe sued  Amazon for race - and sex -based discrimination under Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act and  42 U.S.C . \u00a7 1981.  D.I. 14.  Now Amazon moves to dismiss her \nclaims. D.I. 16.  \nII. SOUSA FAILS TO STATE A TITLE VII CLAIM  \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act forbids  employment discrimination based on race, \nsex, and national origin.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  2000e -2(a)(1) .  \nTo establish Title VII discrimination, Sousa tries four different theories . First, she \nclaims that she was treated differently from  other employees because of her race and \nsex. Second, she says Amazon exposed her to a hostile work environment. Third, she \nalleges that Dorsey  subjected her to quid -pro-quo harassment. Finally, she contends \nthat Amazon retaliated against her for reporting discriminatory behavior. Amazon \nmoves to dismiss all fou r.  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, Sousa must \u201cma[ke] factual allegations that state \na plausible ground for relief.\u201d Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. \n2009)  (citing Bell Atl . Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544,  564 n.8 (2007) ). While her \n\u201ccomplaint need not establish a prima facie case\u201d of Title VII discrimination , she must \nplead \u201cenough f acts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evi-\ndence of the necessary elements.\u201d Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp. , 809 F.3d 780, 788\u2013\n89 (3d Cir. 2016) (cleaned up). Under this standard, all  of Sousa\u2019s  claims fail.  \nA. Sousa fails to allege  differential treatment  because of sex or race  \nTo plead a Title VII disparate- treatment claim, Sousa must allege that:  5 \u2022 she belongs to a  protected class;  \n\u2022 she is qualified for her job;  \n\u2022 she \u201csuffered an adverse employment action ;\u201d and  \n\u2022 the circumstances surrounding that action \u201cgive rise to an inference of in-\ntentional discrimination.\u201d  \nMakky v. Chertoff , 541 F.3d 205, 214 (3d Cir. 2008). She checks the first two boxes:  \nBecause Sousa is an Asian woman, it is uncontested that she is a member of a pro-tected class. And Amazon concedes that Sousa was qualified for her job. D.I. 17, at 5 \u2013\n9. But she fails to chec k the other two.  \n1. Sousa did not suffer an adverse employment action . Sousa calls her temporary \ntransfer an adverse employment action . Not so. To count , it must have  caused  \u201ca sig-\nnificant change in employment status .\u201d Burlington Indus ., Inc. v. Ellerth , 524 U.S. \n742, 761 (1998). That never happened.  \nDemotions are characterized by \u201ca decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished \ntitle, a material loss of benefits, [ or] significantly diminished material responsibili-\nties.\u201d Ellerth , 524 U.S. at 761. Here, Sous a\u2019s allegations fall short . She did not lose \nher job title. Her wage and benefits remained the same . Though she alleges that the \nreassignment hurt her chances of promotion, that assertion is undercut by her com-\nplaint. Compare D.I. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 113\u2212 15 (acknowledging that, despite the transfer, Amazon \nscheduled her for promotion between March\u2212May 2021), with D.I. 20 -1, at 1 (stating \nin an offer letter that Sousa would be up \u201c for a performance assessment and compen-\nsation adjustment\u201d in April 2021).  6 Plus, a  ten-day transfer to fill in for a lower -level employee does not count as \u201csig-\nnificantly diminished material responsibilities.\u201d Ellerth , 524 U.S. at 761. True, Sousa \nsays she went from \u201csupervising associates\u201d to \u201clifting packages .\u201d \u00b6 125. But she was \naske d to do so only for a very brief  time. Plus,  when Sousa returned from the reas-\nsignment , she was no worse off than when she left.  A short -term transfer  with no real  \nconsequence for Sousa\u2019s career is not  an adverse employment action.  See Harlston v. \nMcDonnel l Douglas Corp. , 37 F.3d 379, 382 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201cChanges in duties or \nworking conditions that cause no materially significant disadvantage  \u2026 are insuffi-\ncient .\u201d); Taylor v. Burwell , 2014 WL 3547337, at * 6 (D. Md. July 16, 2014)  (finding a  \nthree -month assignment \u201cbelow [the plaintiff\u2019s] pay grade\u201d was not an adverse ac-\ntion).   \n2. Sousa  does not plead facts suggesting intentional discrimination.  Even if Sousa \nhad pleaded an adverse employment action, she does not plead facts \u201ccreat[ing]  an \ninference that  \u2026 [it] was based on an illegal discriminatory criterion.\u201d Pivirotto v. \nInnovative Sys. , 191 F.3d 344, 356 (3d Cir. 1999)  (internal quotation marks omitted) .  \n \u201c[T]he plaintiff\u2019s task is to demonstrate that similarly situated employees were \nnot tre ated equally.\u201d Tex.  Dept. of Cm ty. Affs. v. Burdine , 450 U.S. 248, 258 (1981). \nThat  is, that she was treated less favorably than employees who are not members of \nthe same protected class. See, e.g. , Mandel v. M&Q Packaging Corp. , 706 F.3d 157, \n170 ( 3d Cir. 2013).  \nHere,  Sousa does not do that . She says that she was selected for reassignment \ninstead of a black woman and white man. D.I. 14, \u00b6 117. Yet the man was not suitable 7 for reassignment  because he was up for a promotion . Id. So he was not similar ly sit-\nuated  to Sousa . Plus, Sousa  does not suggest that she was selected instead of the \nwoman because she is from Japan. So her sex -, race -, and national -origin -based dis-\ncrimination claim s fail.  \nBut I will dismiss her claims  without prejudice; Sousa may still allege that Ama-\nzon took other adverse actions and that  similarly situated  employees  were not reas-\nsigned .  \nB. Sousa fails to allege  a hostile work environment  at Amazon  \nTo assert a hostile- work -environment claim under Title V II, Sousa needed to al-\nlege that s he experienced  severe or pervasive discrimination that is both objectively \nand subjectively detrimental, and that Amazon \u201cknew or should have know n\u201d about \nit and failed to stop it . Kunin v. Sears Roebuck & Co. , 175 F.3d 289, 293 (3d Cir. 1999).   \nIn deciding whether Sousa suffered \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d discrimination, I must \nconsider \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is phys-\nically threatening or humilia ting, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it un-\nreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d Harris v. Forklift Sys., \nInc., 510 U.S. 17, 22\u2013 23 (1993).  \nTo meet this standard, Sousa says she was harassed by two Amazon employees : \nthe supe rvisor who told her she looked like an adult actress and Dorsey. D.I. 14  \u00b6 3, \n31; D.I. 19, at 3. But their alleged conduct does not amount to severe or pervasive \ndiscrimination.   \nStart with Dorsey\u2019s phone calls.  Sousa says he bragged about his promotion, asked \nif she liked his haircut, told her he likes Japanese cartoons, suggested that she should 8 be his \u201ctravel guide\u201d should he make a trip to Japan, requested dating advice, and \nasked about her boyfriend. D.I. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 68,71\u221274, 76, 86, 89, 96, 135. True, repeated \nunwanted advances by a male supervisor may amount to sexual harassment. See , \ne.g., Petril v. Cheyney Univ. of Pa. , 789 F. Supp. 2d 574, 579 (E.D. Pa.  2011). But even \nif Dorsey\u2019s calls count as intentional discrimination, they were not severe. Though he \nasked Sousa if she was available, he never clearly propositioned her or even asked \nher on a date. Nor were his calls pervasive. Sousa \u2019s complaint identi fies four phone \ncalls spread out over three months. D.I. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 68, 69, 76, 84. That is a far cry from \nthe kind of  repeat misconduct that \u201calter[s] the conditions of \u2026 employment and cre-\nate[s] an abusive working environment.\u201d Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. , 510 U.S. 17, \n21 (1993) (quotation marks omitted) ; see also Jacques -Scott v. Sears Holding Corp. , \n2013 WL 2897427, at *10 (D. Del. 2013) (four instances of arguably discriminatory \nconduct not enough).   \nTo Dorsey\u2019s conduct, Sousa adds  one supervisor\u2019s of fensive remarks on her first \nday at work. No doubt , his remarks crossed the line. But even on top of Dorsey\u2019s calls, \nthis isolated incident is not enough to state a claim. See Faragher v. Boca Raton , 524 \nU.S. 775, 788 (1998)  (offhand comments and isolated incidents are not enough);  Wes-\nton v. Pennsylvania , 251 F.3d 420, 428 (3d Cir. 2001) (mere \u201cutterance of an epithet, \njoke, or inappropriate taunt \u2026 does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employ-\nment to implicate Title VII.\u201d).  So this claim fails.  \nC. Sousa fails to allege  quid  pro quo harassment  \nNext, Sousa says that Dorsey subjected her to quid pro quo harassment. To plead \nthis, she must allege that she suffered \u201ctangible adverse action result[ing] from [her] 9 refusal to s ubmit to [Dorsey\u2019s] sexual demands.\u201d Doe v. Mercy Cath . Med. Ctr., 850 \nF.3d 545, 565 (3d Cir. 2017) . \nSousa does not do that. True, she pleads  Dorsey made  romantic advances . She \nalleges that he thought she was \u201creally pretty \u201d and said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t wait to work \nwith her,\u201d then pursued her with lengthy personal calls. D.I. 14 \u00b6 47. And she  argua-\nbly rejected these advances , though she never says when she spurned him . See, e.g. , \nid. \u00b6 95. But Sousa cannot show that as a result Dorsey took a \u201ctangible adverse ac-\ntion\u201d. Id. As I have explained, her temporary reassignment does not count.  Even if it \ndid, Dorsey asked Sousa if she was \u201c available \u201d only  after she returned from her trans-\nfer. Id. \u00b6 135. That is the only time that he allegedly made a \u201csexual demand.\u201d Doe , \n850 at 565 (3d Cir. 2017).  Since Sousa had not yet rejected him when she was trans-\nferred,  it could not have been  due to  Dorsey\u2019s  retaliat ion.  \nD. Sousa fails to allege  that Amazon retaliated against her  \nTitle VII bars  employers  from  retaliating against employees who oppose discrim-\ninatory conduct in the workplace. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  2000e -3(a). To plead Title VII retalia-\ntion, Sousa must allege that she \u201cprotest[ed] \u2026 discriminatory employment practice s\u201d \nand that she suffered an adverse employment action as a result. Moore v. City of \nPhila., 461 F.3d 331, 343  (3d Cir. 2006) . She claims  that three of Amazon\u2019s employ-\nment decisions count as retaliation.  \n1. Sousa\u2019s reassignment from New Jersey to Delaware. Sousa says her transfer \nfrom New Jersey to Delaware was retaliation for reporting her first supervisor\u2019s of-\nfensive comments .  10 Not so. She  \u201chas not explained how, if at all, her transfer [] from one part o f the \ncompany to another w[as] materially adverse.\u201d Rigg v. Urana, 113 F. Supp. 3d 825, \n829 (M.D.N.C. 2015). Plus, she does not allege facts \u201callow [ing] the inference\u201d of a  \ncausal connection between her decision to report the supervisor and the reassign-\nment. Clark Cnty . Sch. Dist. v. Breeden , 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001). Indeed, Amazon \noffered to transfer Sousa only after she had voluntarily resigned. D.I. 14 \u00b6 \u00b6 35\u201336. \nThat cuts against an inference of retaliation : after she resigned, Amazon did not have  \nto offer her a new job.  \n2. Sousa\u2019s temporary reassignment . Sousa contends that  her reassignment to cover \na holiday staffing shortage was retaliation for \u201crebuff[ing] [Dorsey\u2019s] advances.\u201d Id.  \n\u00b6 11. But that argument fails  because  her temporary reassignment does not count as \nan adverse employment action. See Ellerth , 524 U.S. at 761.  \n3. Constructive discharge. Sousa claims that Amazon \u201cconstructively discharg[ed]\u201d \nher after she reported Dorsey. D.I. 14 \u00b6  161. Sousa reported him to  HR while on leave. \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 137\u221239. After HR investigated , Sousa  asked to  be reinstated at a different fa-\ncility. Yet Amazon told her that she had to return to work  before it would consider \nthat request. Id. \u00b6 149.  \nEven if true, those facts do not amount to  a constructive discharge . To plead that, \nSousa must allege that  Amazon \u201cknowingly permitted conditions of discrimination \u2026 \nso intolerable that a reasonable person subject to them would resign.\u201d Goss v. Exxon \nOffice Sys. Co., 747 F.2d 885, 888 (3d Cir. 1984). But t here is no indication that 11 working in the same facility as Dorsey for a short time, while her transfer was pro-\ncessed, would have been \u201cso intolerable\u201d that a reasonable employee would resign.  \nIII. SOUSA FAILS TO STATE A \u00a7 1981  CLAIM  \nIn addition to her Title VII claims, Sousa says Amazon violated her rights under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7  1981. That statute gives \u201c[a]ll persons \u2026 the same right \u2026 to make and \nenforce contracts.\u201d Id. An employer violates it when he racially discriminates against \nan em ployee, thus depriving them of the full benefit of their contract of employment. \nSee, e.g. , Anderson v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp. , 621 F.3d 261, 267 (3d Cir. 2010).  \nThe elements of a \u00a7  1981 claim \u201care generally identical to the elements of an em-\nployment discrimination claim under Title VII.\u201d Brown v. J. Kaz, Inc., 581 F.3d 175, \n181\u221282. Thus, Sousa must show that Amazon took an adverse employment action \nbased on \u201ca racially discriminatory motive.\u201d Id.  Yet as I have explained, Sousa does \nnot plead that . \n* * * * * \nSousa says Amazon discriminated against her based on her sex and race. Yet the \ndetails in her complaint do not live up to  those  serious allegations. True, Sousa was \nasked to endure an inconvenient temporary reassignment. Plus , one of her supervi-\nsors made  offensive remarks and another made a handful of unwanted phone calls. \nBut those are workplace troubles , not discrimination. So Sousa\u2019s claims fail. But b e-\ncause she might still augment her complaint, I dismiss without prejudice.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nEMILY  SOUSA , \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n AMAZON.COM,\n INC.,  AMAZON.COM  \nSERVICES  LLC,  and LAWRENCE  \nDORSEY  \n  \nDefendant s. \n No. 1:21- cv-717-SB \n \nORDER  \n1.
