Civil Action No. 20-628-MN\nABDESLAM KALAI, KALAI PHONY,\n\nKALAI GROUP, LLC, and GOOGLE,\nLLC,\n\nwee was as asa eS Se\n\nDefendants.\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\nPresently before the court in this civil action for copyright infringement and false\nadvertising is plaintiff Freddy S.p.A.\u2019s (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) motion for entry of judgment by default\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2) against defendants Abdeslam Kalai, Kalai\nPhony, and Kalai Group, LLC (the \u201cDefaulting Defendants\u201d). (D.I. 26) For the following\nreasons, I recommend that the court GRANT Plaintiffs motion for entry of default judgment\nunder Rule 55(b)(2) and issue a permanent injunction against the Defaulting Defendants.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff initiated this action on May 10, 2020 and filed a first amended and supplemental\ncomplaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) on October 26, 2021, alleging causes of action for copyright infringement\nand false advertising relating to the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 alleged infringement of the stitching\ndesign used on Plaintiff's WR.UP\u00ae pants and false representations that the infringing products\nare made in the United States. (D.I. 14 at ff 13-19, 40-46) In accordance with the court\u2019s order\ndated October 5, 2021, Plaintiff served the summons and FAC on Abdeslam Kalai and Kalai\n\nPhony by electronic means on October 29, 2021. (D.I. 11; D.I. 15) Plaintiff served the\nsummons and FAC on defendant Kalai Group, LLC by way of its registered agent on November\n1, 2021. (DI. 17)\n\nThe Defaulting Defendants failed to file and serve a timely responsive pleading or motion\nas required under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. At Plaintiff's request, the\nClerk of Court entered the default in appearance against the Defaulting Defendants pursuant to\nRule 55(a) on January 14, 2022 (the \u201cEntry of Default in Appearance\u201d). (D.I. 21; DI. 24) On\nthe same day, Plaintiff served the Entry of Default in Appearance on Abdeslam Kalai and Kalai\nPhony by electronic means. (D.I. 25) Plaintiff served the Entry of Default in Appearance on\nKalai Group, LLC\u2019s registered agent on January 17, 2022. (/d.)\n\nOn March 11, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion for entry of default judgment pursuant to\nRule 55(b)(2). (D.I. 26) Plaintiff\u2019s motion was accompanied by an affidavit of service\nconfirming that a copy of the motion for default judgment was served on each of the Defaulting\nDefendants in the same manner as the FAC and Entry of Default in Appearance. (D.I. 26-3)\nThe assigned District Judge then referred the pending motion to the undersigned judicial officer\non March 14, 2022. (D.I. 28)\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2) provides that a district court may enter default\njudgment against a party when default has been entered by the Clerk of Court. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n55(b). The decision to enter a default judgment is within the discretion of the court. Tristrata\nTech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy Research, Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D. Del. 2010) (citing Hritz\nv. Woma Corp., 732 F.2d 1178, 1180 (3d Cir. 1984)). The court\u2019s determination is guided by\nthree considerations: \u201c(1) prejudice to the plaintiff if default is denied, (2) whether the defendant\n\nappears to have a litigable defense, and (3) whether defendant\u2019s delay is due to culpable\nconduct.\u201d Chamberlain v. Giampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 2000). \u201cA consequence of the\nentry of a default judgment is that the factual allegations of the complaint, except those relating\nto the amount of damages, will be taken as true.\u201d Comdyne I, Inc. v. Corbin, 908 F.2d 1142,\n1149 (3d Cir. 1990); see J & J Sports Prod., Inc. v. Kim, C.A. No. 14-1170-LPS, 2016 WL\n1238223, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2016).\n\nThe court may conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the amount of damages or\nestablish the truth of the allegations. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). However, \u201cRule 55 does not\nrequire that testimony be presented as a prerequisite to the entry of a default judgment[.]\u201d 10A\nC. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2688 (3d ed. 2007); see Rhino\nAssocs., L.P. v. Berg Mfg. & Sales Corp., 531 F. Supp. 2d 652, 657 (M.D. Pa. 2007). Plaintiff\nseeks only injunctive relief in this instance, and for the reasons set forth below, the\nuncontroverted factual allegations in the FAC obviate the need for a hearing to substantiate\nPlaintiff's proposed permanent injunction. See SEC v. Krimm, C.A. No. 17-464-RDM, 2019 WL\n2270437, at *5 (D. Del. May 28, 2019) (granting proposed injunctive relief without a hearing on\na motion for default judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2)).\n\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Default Judgment\n\nI recommend that the court grant Plaintiff's motion for default judgment against the\nDefaulting Defendants. As described at \u00a7 I, supra, Plaintiff has demonstrated that it properly\nserved the summons and FAC, the Defaulting Defendants failed to answer or otherwise respond,\nand the Clerk of Court entered a default in appearance against the Defaulting Defendants.\n\nAccordingly, the court takes as true the factual allegations in the FAC. See Comdyne I, 908 F.2d\nat 1149. Moreover, the factors articulated by the Third Circuit in Chamberlain weigh in favor of\ndefault judgment against the Defaulting Defendants. See Chamberlain, 210 F.3d at 164.\n\nThe factual allegations in the FAC support Plaintiff's claims that the Defaulting\nDefendants violated the federal Copyright Act and the Lanham Act. With respect to copyright\ninfringement, the FAC sets forth facts confirming that: (1) Plaintiff owns a valid copyright, (D.L.\n14 at J] 52-54; Ex. A); and (2) the Defaulting Defendants knowingly copied original elements of\nPlaintiff's work, as evidenced by the substantial similarity of the Defaulting Defendants\u2019\nproducts to Plaintiff's WR.UP\u00ae pants, (id. at {J 18-19, 31, 55-61). See Tanksley v. Daniels, 902\nF.3d 165, 171 (3d Cir. 2018). As for Plaintiff's false advertising claim under the Lanham Act,\nthe FAC points to evidence showing that: (1) the Defaulting Defendants made false or\nmisleading statements regarding the origin of their own product, (D.I. 14 at [{ 40-46; Exs. G-H);\n(2) the Defaulting Defendants actually deceived a substantial portion of their customers, (id. at\n491 47, 77; Ex. I); (3) the deception is likely to influence customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, (id. at\n49 48, 78; Ex. 1); (4) the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 products traveled in interstate commerce, (id. at\n49 49, 79; Ex. H); and (5) Plaintiff suffered declining sales as a result, (id. at ] 81). See Warner-\nLambert Co. v. Breathasure, Inc., 204 F.3d 87, 91-92 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nThe Chamberlain factors further support the entry of default judgment against the\nDefaulting Defendants. First, Plaintiff will be prejudiced by its inability to enforce its copyright\nif the motion is denied, and the Defaulting Defendants will likely continue to infringe Plaintiffs\ncopyright. See Tristrata Tech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy Res., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D.\nDel. 2010). Second, whether the Defaulting Defendants have a litigable defense is unclear due to\ntheir failure to appear and participate in the litigation. See id Third, the Defaulting Defendants\n\nhave been on notice of this action, and their decision not to defend against the allegations in the\nFAC amounts to willful and culpable conduct. See SEC v. Krimm, C.A. No. 17-464-RDM, 2019\nWL 2270437, at *5 (D. Del. May 28, 2019). For these reasons, I recommend that the court grant\nPlaintiff's motion for default judgment under Rule 55(b)(2).\n\nB. Permanent Injunction\n\nPlaintiff asks the court to permanently enjoin the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 conduct. (D.I.\n26-1 at 8-10) The court may award injunctive relief under both the Copyright Act and the\nLanham Act. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116. Generally, a party prevailing on the merits\nmust show four factors to obtain a permanent injunction: (1) it will suffer irreparable injury; (2)\nno remedy available at law would be sufficient; (3) the balance of hardships tips in its favor; and\n(4) the injunction would serve public interests. TD Bank N.A. v. Hill, 928 F.3d 259, 278 (3d Cir.\n2019). In the \u201cspecialized context\u201d of a default judgment, where the defendant does not respond\nand the plaintiff cannot quantify its damages, these factors generally weigh in favor of injunctive\nrelief. See Ottomanson, Inc. v. UCAI, LLC, 2020 WL 205945, at *4 (D.N.J. Jan. 10, 2020)\n(\u201cMerely enjoining infringement does not deprive the defendant of anything to which it is\nentitled, and it is in the public interest to do so.\u201d).\n\nBecause liability for copyright infringement and false advertising has been established\nand Plaintiff has shown that future violations are likely, the court may issue a permanent\ninjunction. See Krimm, 2019 WL 2270437, at *6 (issuing permanent injunctive relief on a\nmotion for default judgment because defendants did not respond to the complaint or otherwise\nrepresent that future violations were unlikely); Innovative Office Prods., Inc. v. Amazon.com,\nInc., 2012 WL 1466512, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 26, 2012) (issuing a permanent injunction based on\nacceptance of infringement allegation as true for purposes of the motion for default judgment);\n\nBroadcast Music, Inc. v. Shane\u2019s Flight Deck, Ltd., 2010 WL 4916208, at *1 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 24,\n2010) (finding a permanent injunction was warranted for alleged copyright infringement on a\nmotion for default judgment \u201cgiven the past and likely continued violations by defendant\u201d).\nConsequently, I recommend that the court issue a permanent injunction against the Defaulting\nDefendants.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT Plaintiffs motion for\nentry of default judgment under Rule 55(b)(2), enter judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 58, and issue a permanent injunction in the form attached at D.I. 26-2 enjoining the\nDefaulting Defendants from: (1) infringing Plaintiff's copyright pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 502, and\n(2) falsely claiming that products sold on the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 website were \u201cmade in the\nUSA.\u201d (D.I. 26)\n\nPlaintiff shall serve a copy of this Report and Recommendation on the Defaulting\nDefendants in the same manner Plaintiff served the Defaulting Defendants with the Entry of\nDefault in Appearance and shall file proof of such service with the court.\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to three (3)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage v. Barnhart, 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1\n\n(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: April 28, 2022\n\nSh\u00e9rry R.
