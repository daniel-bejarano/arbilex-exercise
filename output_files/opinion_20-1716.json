No. 20- 1716- CFC -JLH \n    \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nPlaintiff Naquan Karon Hight  appeals fro m unfavorable  decision s of the Commissioner of \nthe Social Security Administration1 denying his applications for child\u2019 s insurance benefits and \nsupplemental security income ( \u201cSSI\u201d) benefits.  This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  \nThe parties  filed cross -motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 14; D.I. 18.)  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench on February 11, 2022, I recommend that  the Court DENY  Plaintiff \u2019s \nmotion and GRANT the Commissioner \u2019s cross- motion , as I conclude that the Commissioner \u2019s \ndecision s are supported by substantial evidence and that there are no reversible errors.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissioner \u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence. \u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidence  \u201cmeans \u2014and means only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d   Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kijikazi  \nwas automatically substituted for former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul when she \nsucceeded him on July 9, 2021. 2 \n 1154 (2019)  (quoting Consol . Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)) .  In reviewing \nwhether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts  may not \u201c re-weigh the \nevidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d   Chandler v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d \n356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011) ; see also  Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014) .  In other \nwords, r eviewing courts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner \u2019s decision, even if they would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner  follows a five -step sequential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third Circuit has previously explained this \nsequential analysis , and the shifting burdens that attend each step, in detail: \nThe first two steps involve threshold determina tions.  In step \none, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.  If a claimant is found to be engaging in substantial gainful activity, the disability claim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.  If the claimant does not have a severe \nimpairment or combination of impairments, the disability claim is denied.  In step three, the Commissi oner compares the medical \nevidence of the claimant \u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.  If the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer \nfrom a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work .  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating \nan inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final step.  At this stage, the burden of production shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order  to \ndeny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, a nd residual 3 \n functional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of \nall the claimant\u2019 s impairments in determining whether he is capable \nof performing work and is not disabled.  \nNewell v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 545 \u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is identical whether an application seeks  disability insurance benefits  or supplemental \nsecurity income.  McCrea v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nMy Report and Recommendation  was announced from the bench on February 11, 2022, as \nfollows:  \nI\u2019m ready to give you my reports and recommendations on \nthe cross -motions for summary judgment in Hight v. Kijakazi  and \nthe cross -motions for summary judgment in Charlier v. Kija kazi. \n I will summarize the reasons for my recommendations in a \nmoment. But before I do, I want to be clear that my failure to address a particular argument advanced by a party does not mean that I did not consider it.  We have carefully considered the per tinent portions \nof the administrative record and the parties \u2019 briefs in both cases.  I \nam not going to read my understanding of the applicable law into the record today; however, we will incorporate the rulings I am about to state into a separate, written document, and we will include \na summary of the applicable law in that document.  \n I\u2019ll start with Hight v. Kijakazi .  For the reasons that follow, \nI recommend that Mr. Hight \u2019s motion for summary judgment be \ndenied and the Commissioner \u2019s cross- motion for sum mary \njudgment be granted . \n Mr. Hight is a young man with severe mental disabilities.  \nThis appeal concerns his requests for child\u2019 s insurance benefits and \nsupplemental security income benefits.  The ALJ issued two decisions at issue here.  In her first dec ision, the ALJ addressed \nHight \u2019s claim for child \u2019s insurance benefits and found that he was \nnot disabled prior to November []  2017, the date he turned twenty -\ntwo years old.  In a second decision, the ALJ addressed Hight \u2019s \nclaim for SSI and found that he wa s not disabled at any time after \nJuly 1, 2014, the date his prior student benefits were terminated.  The \ntwo decisions reached similarly -grounded conclusions.  Hight \u2019s \nbriefing to this Court does not suggest that there are any differences 4 \n between the ALJ \u2019s findings in the two decisions that are relevant to \nhis arguments.  Accordingly, I \u2019ll do as Hight does and treat them \ntogether.   \n \nHight has never worked, but he graduated from high school  \nand, at the time of the Commissioner \u2019s decision , he was living at \nhome and was enrolled part  time in community college.   The ALJ \nfound at step two  that Hight had three severe impairments: autism \nspectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), \nand specific developmental learning difficulty.2  At step three, the \nALJ found that Hight \u2019s impairments did not meet the standards for \na listed impairment, so she went on to step four .3   \n At step four , she found that Hight had \u201c the residual \nfunctional capacity to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels but with the following nonexertional limitations: he can never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; he can have occasional exposure to extreme heat, extreme cold, vibrations, fumes, odors, dusts, gases, \nand poor ventilation; he can tolerate lights no brighter than a typical office setting and noise no louder than a typical office setting level; he is limited to simple, routine, and repetitive tasks, but not at production pace, for instance assembly -type work; he can perform \nsimple work -related decisions; he can tolerate few changes in a \nroutine work setting; he can frequently interact with supervisors and coworkers but only occasionally work in tandem with others; and he can occasionally int eract with the public. \u201d\n4  At the last step, the ALJ \nfound that a person with Hight \u2019s RFC could work as [, e.g.,]  a \nlaundry folder, a mail clerk, or a hand packager.5   \n Hight challenges the ALJ \u2019s RFC determination.  He argues \nthat, in formulating the RFC, the ALJ failed to consider all of the \npsychosocial supports that Hight was receiving at home and school.  \nIn particular, Hight suggests that the ALJ failed to sufficiently \nconsider the fact that  he currently lives at home and that he receives \nmore help at home and at school than a young adult without his impairments would generally receive.  I disagree, and I conclude that the ALJ \u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and that \nthere are no reversible errors.  \n \n \n2 (Transcript of Social Security Proceedings, D.I. 12 (\u201cRecord\u201d or \u201cR.\u201d), at 13, 32.)  \n \n3 (Id.)   \n \n4 (R. 15, 34 \u201335.)   \n \n5 (R. 19\u201320, 38\u201339.)   5 \n To be clear, both sides agree that Hight has severe mental \ndisabilities that cause symptoms.  Moreover, no one disputes that an \nALJ must consider evidence of help and accommodations a claimant receives, along with all of the other e vidence, when formulating \ntheir RFC.\n6  Moreover, the law is clear that, when fashioning a \nclaimant \u2019s RFC, the ALJ must set forth what the claimant can do \u2014\nexpressed in the form of work -related functions \u2014without any \nadditional help or accommodations.  Altho ugh Hight\u2019s argument to \nthis Court is not entirely clear, he is incorrect to the extent that he is suggesting the  ALJ was required to expressly reference or state the \naccommodations Hight receives at school in the RFC itself.  The RFC is supposed to represent the most a claimant can do without accommodations.\n7   \n In this case, the ALJ thoroughly reviewed the evidenc e\u2014\nincluding the evidence that Hight receives help at home and \naccommodations at school \u2014and the ALJ explained why the \nevidence led to her conclusions that Hight had the capacity to do simple, routine, repetitive work that involved simple decisions, few chan ges in the routine, and limits on his social interaction.   \n There was substantial evidence to support the ALJ \u2019s RFC \ndetermination.  The ALJ had evidence of Hight \u2019s daily activities, \nscholastic achievements (with some support), attempts to work, and confli cting medical and mental health opinions.  It is true that the \nmental health professionals who assessed Hight opined that the accommodations he receives help his current level of functioning, but that does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that he would be \ncompletely unable to function without those accommodations.  And there is no evidence that the help and accommodations that Hight receives are so crucial that it was unreasonable for the ALJ to credit the evidence that she credited.   \n \n \n6 See, e.g., SSR 11 -2p, 76 Fed. Reg. 56263, 56266 (Sept. 12, 2011) ; 20 C.F.R \n404.1545(a)(3), (e) (\u201cIn assessing the total limiting effects of your impairment(s) and any related symptoms, we will consider all of the medical and nonmedi cal evidence . . .  .\u201d); SSR 96 -8p, 61 \nFed. Reg. 34475, 34477 (July 2, 1996) (\u201cThe RFC assessment must be based on all  of the relevant \nevidence in the case record, such as . . . Reports of daily activities,\u201d and \u201cNeed for a structured living environment . . . .\u201d (emphasis in original)).   \n \n7 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a); SSR  11-2p, 76 Fed. Reg. at 56266\u201367 (\u201c[W]e consider how \nwell the young adult would function without the extra help.\u201d); SSR  96-8p, 61 Fed. Reg. at 34477 \n(\u201c[N]onexertional  capacity must be expressed in terms of work -related functions .\u201d).   6 \n This case is dis tinguishable from [ Grier v. Saul ].8  In that \ncase, the claimant was schizophrenic, and the only evidence of his \nsuccessful functioning was when he avoided unfamiliar individuals and was supported by individuals who could ensure that he maintained complian ce with medication that he needed to function.\n9  \nThere, the Third Circuit held that the ALJ failed to explain and \nsupport her conclusion that he could function without such a \nsupportive environment .10  In this case, the ALJ considered the fact \nthat Hight was receiving psychosocial supports at home and school \nbut pointed to other evidence , including Hight \u2019s daily activities , \nsupporting her finding that Hight could nevertheless do simple, routine, repetitive work that involved simple decisions, few changes in the routine, and limits on his social interaction.   \n Hight does not identify any particular evidence he says the \nALJ failed to consider or address in her step four analysis.  Indeed, \nHight acknowledges that the ALJ \u2019s step four  analysis addressed the \nextra supports he receives.\n11  What Hight really seems to be \nsuggesting is that the ALJ must have failed to consider the evidence of his current extra supports because she concluded that Hight could work in accordance with the limitations in the RFC without those supports.  But that is nothing more than an argument that the ALJ should have weighed the evidence differently.  This Court \u2019s role is \nnot to reweigh the evidence; it is to determine whether the ALJ \u2019s \nfindings are supported by substantial evidence.  Substantial evidence \u201cmeans \u2014and means only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d\n12  Here, there was a wide variety of evidence that \ncould persuade a reasonable ALJ that Hight was capable of some work with limitations but without the extra supports. \n In sum, there was conflicting evidence and the ALJ \nconsidered all of it.  I cannot say she did so unreasonably or illogically.  Thus, I find no legal error.  \n \n \n8 822 F. App\u2019x 166 (3d Cir. 2020).    \n \n9 Id. at 170\u201371.  \n \n10 Id. \n \n11 D.I. 15 at 15.  \n   \n12 Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154.   7 \n I recommend that Plaintiff \u2019s motion for summary judgment \nbe denied and Defendant \u2019s cross- motion for summary judgment be \ngranted.   \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nI recommend that Plaintiff \u2019s motion for summary judgment  (D.I. 1 4) be DENIED  and \nDefendant \u2019s motion for summary judgment  (D.I. 1 8) be GRANTED.  I recommend that the Court  \nenter judgment in favor of Defendant and CLOSE the case. \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636( b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.  Any \nobjections to the Report and Recommendation shall be filed within fourteen days and limited to ten pages.  Any response shall be filed within fourteen d ays thereafter and limited to ten pages.  \nThe failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo review in the district court.   \nThe parties are directed to the Court \u2019s \u201cStanding Order for Objections Filed Under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72,\u201d dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which can be found on the Court\u2019 s website.  \n \nDated: February 25, 2022   ______________________________ \n      The Honorable Jennifer L.
