Pro Se Plaintiff. \nApril 4, 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION {]L_ (T-\nPlaintiff Aki Newman appears prose and has been granted leave to proceed in \nforma pauperis. (0.1. 4) He commenced this action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. (See \n0.1. 2-1 civil cover sheet). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) . \nBACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \nscreening purposes . See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. \n2008). Plaintiff sues the Newport Police Department and Cities Insurance Association \nof Washington . \nPlaintiff alleges that on December 5, 2021, police from the Newport Police \nDepartment who had tried to kill Plaintiff \"vowed to finish the job.\" (0.1. 2 at 4) Plaintiff \nexplains that he had an encounter with an officer who apparently believed Plaintiff was \ninvolved in a drug transaction , Plaintiff was riding his dirt bike, a black Chevy truck came \nfor him and scared Plaintiff, he \"pulled off' and the police chased him. (Id. at 5) Plaintiff \nawakened in the ICU. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges his teeth were knocked out, he suffers from \nheadaches , has brain damage, PTSD, and fears death. He alleges that the same \nofficer later approached him again. Plaintiff seeks 10.5 million dollars in damages. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious , fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n1 2013). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take \nthem in the light most favorable to a prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 \nF.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint , \"however \ninartfully pleaded , must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings \ndrafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 \nU.S. 319,331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103,112 \n(3d Cir. 2002). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends 'on an \"indisputably \nmeritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless \" or \"fantastic or delusional \" factual \nscenario.\"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Hom, 318 F.3d 523, \n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions. Tourscherv . McCullough , 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999). However , before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) , the Court \nmust grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be \ninequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in \nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court \nconcludes that those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell \n2 At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations \" \nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \"labels and \nconclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" Davis v. \nAbington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF \nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) and Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient \nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility . See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 \nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal \ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine \nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. \nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations \nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \"show\" that \nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \n3 II. DISCUSSION \nA. Criminal Charges \nThe Complaint states that the basis for jurisdiction is a defendant that is the \nUnited States or a federal official or agency. There are, however, no federal \ndefendants . The civil cover sheet states that this matter arises under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 \nwhich is a federal criminal statute. \nTo the extent that Plaintiff seeks to impose criminal liability upon Defendants \npursuant to the criminal statute upon which he relies, he lacks standing to proceed. See \nAllen v. Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, 270 F. App'x 149, 150 (3d Cir. \n2008); see United States v. Friedland , 83 F.3d 1531, 1539 (3d Cir. 1996) (\"[T)he United \nStates Attorney is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases within his or her \ndistrict.\"). The decision of whether to prosecute , and what criminal charges to bring, \ngenerally rests with the prosecutor . See United States v. Batchelder , 442 U.S. 114, 124 \n(1979). Therefore, the claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 will be dismissed as frivolous \npursuant to pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). \n8. 42 u.s.c. \u00a7 1983 \nTo the extent Plaintiff intended the Complaint raise civil rights claims under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the allegations are deficient. To prevail on a\u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff \nmust show that a person (or persons), acting under color of law, deprived him of a \nconstitutional right. Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981), overruled on other \ngrounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986; Thomas v. Tice, 948 F.3d 133, 138 \n(3d Cir. 2020). \n4 There are no allegations that either Defendant is a state actor. In addition, \nassuming the New Police Department is a state actor, the claim against it, nonetheless \nfails. In order for a civil rights plaintiff to successfully sue a municipal entity under\u00a7 \n1983, the plaintiff must show that his injury was caused by municipal policy or custom is \nequally applicable , irrespective of whether the remedy sought is money damages or \nprospective relief. See Los Angeles County v. Humphries , 562 U.S. 29 (2010). The \nComplaint contains no such allegations . \nAccordingly , the claim will be dismissed the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). Plaintiff will be given leave to amend. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAKI NEWMAN, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nNEWPORT POLICE DEPARTMENT , \net al., \nDefendants . : Civil Action No. 21-1731-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this t.f1kaay of April 2022, for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date; \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1.
