Holmes, C\nROSS & SIMON , LLC, Wilmington, DE \u2013 attorneys for \nDefendant      \n \n                 September 29, 2022 Wilmington, Delaware    1  \nNOREIKA, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE: \n Presently before the Court is the renewed motion of Plai ntiff CIGNEX Datamatics, Inc. \n(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cCIGNEX\u201d) for an aw ard of attorneys\u2019 fees.  (D.I. 146).1  For the reasons set forth \nbelow, CIGNEX\u2019s motion is DENIED.  This opini on constitutes the Court\u2019s findings of fact and \nconclusions of law pursuant to Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nI. BACKGROUND2 \nThis case involved a dispute between CIGNEX and Defendant Lam Research Corporation \n(\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cLam\u201d) over a contract relating to software development services that CIGNEX \nwas to provide to Lam (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d).  Afte r a three-day bench trial, the Court found that \nCIGNEX had proven that Lam breached the Agreem ent by failing to pay for certain services \nrendered and, further, that Lam failed to pr ove that CIGNEX breached the Agreement, the \ncovenant of good faith and fa ir dealing or that CIGNEX was unjustly enriched.  ( See D.I. 126; see \nalso D.I. 127).  On May 6, 2020, the Court entere d judgment in favor of CIGNEX and against Lam \nin the amount of $232,039.71 (D.I. 129) and, on Ja nuary 21, 2021, the Court amended its judgment \nto award pre- and post-judgment interest (D.I. 1 45).  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \naffirmed the judgment.  ( See D.I. 149).  After the Third Circuit had issued its opinion but before \nthe mandate issued, CIGNEX filed a renewed moti on for attorneys\u2019 fees based on the Agreement\u2019s \nprovision awarding reasonable fees to the prevailing party.  ( See D.I. 146 & 147). \n\u00a0\n1  CIGNEX requested attorneys\u2019 fees in its pos t-trial motion seeking pr e- and post-judgment \ninterest, but the Court de nied the request for fees with l eave to renew after the then-pending \nappeal.  ( See D.I. 141 at 7:20-23). \n2  A more detailed recitation of the procedural history of this case may be found in the Court\u2019s \npost-trial opinion (D.I. 126)  and opinion on Lam\u2019s motion for a finding of spoliation and \nfor sanctions (D.I. 100).  2  CIGNEX requests $593,142.85 in attorneys\u2019  fees and other expenses.  ( See D.I. 147 at 19).  \nIn support of the amount requested, CIGNEX provi ded the Court with a declaration from Divya \nKumat, former in-house General Counsel for CI GNEX and now Authorized Representative for \nCIGNEX.  ( See D.I. 148).  Lam opposes the award of any fees.  (D.I. 151).  Briefing on the motion \nwas completed on November 8, 2021.  (D.I. 152).  II. LEGAL STANDARDS \n\u201cUnder the American Rule and Delaware law, litigants are normally responsible for paying \ntheir own litigation costs.\u201d  Mahani v. Edix Media Grp., Inc. , 935 A.2d 242, 245 (Del. 2007).  One \nexception to this rule ma y be found in litig ation arising from contract s containing fee-shifting \nprovisions.  Id.  A court may award a prev ailing party its reasonable co sts and fees in connection \nwith litigating a contract dispute when the parties have so agreed by the te rms of that contract.  Id.  \nIn that case, the court\u2019s task is to determine whet her the requested costs and fees are reasonable.   \nIn assessing the reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 fees requested in contract litigation,3 \nDelaware courts consider the factors set forth in the Delaware Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional \nConduct:  \u201c(1) the time and labor  required, the novelty and difficul ty of the questions involved, \nand the skill requisite to perform  the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood, if a pparent to the \nclient, that the acceptance of the particular em ployment will preclude other employment by the \nlawyer; (3) the fee customarily charged in the lo cality for similar legal services; (4) the amount \ninvolved and the results obtaine d; (5) the time limi tations imposed by th e client or by the \n\u00a0\n3  The parties do not dispute that  Delaware law recognizes fee-sh ifting contract provisions as \nenforceable or that the Agr eement contains such a provision in Paragraph 19.  (PTX-44 \n\u00b6 19).  CIGNEX acknowledges the use of the Rules of Professional Conduct in assessing \nreasonableness but intimates the factors may not be applicable in contractual fee-shifting \ncases.  ( See D.I. 147 at 13).  CIGNEX cites nothing to suggest that Delaware law imposes \nsome other standard in cases involving fee dis putes arising out of contracts.  And CIGNEX \nultimately presents the individual factors se t forth in the Rules of Professional Conduct.  3  circumstances; (6) the nature a nd length of the professional relatio nship with the client; (7) the \nexperience, reputation, and abil ity of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and (8) \nwhether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u201d  D EL. LAWYERS \u2019 RULES OF PROF\u2019L CONDUCT R. 1.5(a); see \nalso Mahani , 935 A.2d at 245-46.  Additionally, in reviewi ng a request for attorneys\u2019 fees, a court \nshould also ask whether the amount of time de voted to litigation wa s \u201cexcessive, redundant, \nduplicative or otherwise unnecessary.\u201d  Mahani , 935 A.2d at 247-48. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nThe Agreement between the parties contemplates reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the \nprevailing party in either litigation or arbitration: \nIn any judicial or arbitrati on proceeding concerning a dispute \nrelating to or arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all reasonable expenses associated with such \nproceeding (including without limitation reasonable costs and fees of attorneys or other professionals),  except that (i) if the prevailing \nparty has at any time refused a se ttlement offer pertaining to such \ndispute which is equal to  or greater than the prevailing party\u2019s actual \nrecovery determined in such judici al or arbitration proceeding, then \nno such fees or costs will be awarde d, and (ii) if th e prevailing party \nhas at any time refused a settlement  offer pertaining to such dispute \nwhich is less than the prevailing pa rty\u2019s actual recovery determined \nin such judicial or arbitration proc eeding, then an such fees or costs \nassociated with recovering the difference between the refused settlement offer and the actual recovery must bear a reasonable relation to such difference. \n(PTX-44 \u00b6 19).  There is no dis pute that the present case qualifies as a judicial proceeding relating \nto the parties\u2019 Agreement such that reasonable a ttorneys\u2019 fees may be available to the prevailing \nparty.  Lam disputes, however, that CIGNEX is a pr evailing party such that attorneys\u2019 fees should \nbe available.  Indeed, Lam\u2019s opposition to CIGN EX\u2019s fee motion focuses heavily on the prevailing \nparty issue.  ( See D.I. 151 at 6-10). \n   4  A. CIGNEX Is a Prevailing Party \nIn this case, CIGNEX asserted only one claim against Lam \u2013 a breach of contract claim.  \n(See generally  D.I. 1).  Lam asserted a counterclaim for br each of contract, as well as counterclaims \nfor bad faith breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fa ir dealing and unjust \nenrichment.  ( See D.I. 8 at pgs. 10-14).  At trial, CIGNEX prevailed on its breach of contract claim \nagainst Lam, and Lam failed to prov e its breach of contract claim against CIGNEX.  In particular, \nCIGNEX proved its breach of contract claim as re lated to services rendered under CR-1, CR-2 and \nCR-3 (but not CR-4 and CR-5).  ( See D.I. 126 at 18-25).  Although CIGNEX sought $434,096.71 \nin damages for its one claim ( see D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-19), based on the C ourt\u2019s post-trial opinion, CIGNEX \nwas awarded $232,039.71 in damages plus $60,564.56 in pre-judgment intere st, as well as post-\njudgment interest ( see D.I. 145).  Those damages correspond to amounts due under CR-1, CR-2 \nand CR-3.  CIGNEX also prevailed on all countercla ims asserted by Lam.  (D.I. 145 \u00b6 1).  Although \nLam was not successful in provi ng any of its counterclaims, it was able to reduc e the amount of \ndamages available to CIGNEX by $58,000 throu gh summary judgment.  (D.I. 94 at 6). \nLam\u2019s main argument agai nst any award of fees is that CIGNEX should not be considered \na prevailing party in this litigati on because it was not a pr evailing party on all or even most issues.  \nIn Lam\u2019s view, CIGNEX only recovered money da mages under two of six invoices at issue, \nmeaning that \u201cCIGNEX failed to pr evail on two-thirds of the invoices that form ed the basis of its \nlawsuit.\u201d  (D.I. 151 at 7).  Moreover, CIGNEX\u2019s damages claim was reduced before trial by Lam\u2019s \npartial success on summary judgment.  As suc h, according to Lam, because CIGNEX purportedly \nfailed to recover two-thirds of its requested damages, it should not  be considered a prevailing party \nat all and no attorneys\u2019 fees should be available.  ( Id.).  The Court declines to follow Lam\u2019s \napproach because doing so would contravene pre cedent and the Agreement between the parties.  5  CIGNEX need not prevail on all or a majority of issues for attorneys\u2019 fees to be available \nin this case.  Neither Delaware precedent nor the Ag reement itself requires as much.  In contractual \nfee-shifting cases, the relevant sta ndard for prevailing part y status is predominance in the litigation \nunless the parties agree othe rwise in the contract.  See, e.g. , Comrie v. Enterasys Networks, Inc. , \nNo. 19254, 2004 WL 936505, at *2 (Del. Ch. Apr. 27, 2004)  (\u201cThe language of  the Agreement, \nitself the product of long negotiation by sophisticated parties and attorneys, clearly provides for an \nall-or-nothing approach in identifying the \u2018prevai ling party.\u2019 . . . That traditional application is an \nall-or-nothing approach involving an inquiry into whic h party predominated in the litigation.\u201d), \naff\u2019d , 864 A.2d 929 (Del. 2004); Brandin v. Gottlieb , No. 14819, 2000 WL 1005954, at *28 (Del. \nCh. July 13, 2000) (\u201cHaving chosen the common te rm \u2018prevailing party,\u2019 the parties can be \npresumed to have intended that that term would be applied by the court as it has traditionally done \nso.  And under any traditional application of the term, Jill\u2019s predominance in the litigation entitles \nher to that appellation.\u201d); see also  Praxis Energy Agents Pte.  Ltd. v. M/V Pebble Beach , No. 17-\n559-LPS, 2021 WL 3145610, at *2 (D. Del. July 26, 2021) (\u201cThe Terms and Conditions provide \nthat \u2018 the prevailing party\u2019 \u2013 indicating a singular anal ysis is required to determine who, overall, \nprevailed \u2013 \u2018shall have the right to recover from the losing party its  reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 \nfees incurred in such proceeding ,\u2019 without delineating between t hose fees and costs incurred in \nthe portions of the proceeding on which Defenda nt prevailed and those on which it did not.\u201d \n(emphases in original)), aff\u2019d , No. 21-2809 (3d Cir. Sept. 27, 2022); Greenstar, LLC v. Heller , 934 \nF. Supp. 2d 672, 697 (D. Del. 2013) (\u201cBecause the f ee-shifting provision contains no qualifying \nlanguage, the court will apply it in an all-or-nothing manner.\u201d). \nHere, CIGNEX and Lam agreed to a fee-shiftin g provision that did not  tie the amount of \nrecoverable fees to the degree of  success obtained in litig ation:  \u201cIn any judicial or arbitration  6  proceeding concerning a dispute relating to or aris ing out of this Agreement, the prevailing party \nis entitled to recover all reasona ble expenses associated with su ch proceeding (including without \nlimitation reasonable costs and fees of attorneys or  other professionals) . . . .\u201d  (PTX-44 \u00b6 19).  \nRather, the Agreement allows CIGNEX to recover all reasonable expenses (including attorneys\u2019 \nfees) if it is the prevailing party in this litigation.  As with othe r courts that have addressed this \nissue, this Court finds that a traditional applica tion of the term \u201cprevailin g party\u201d is appropriate \nhere, especially because the Agreement does not indicate any other meaning was intended.   \nDelaware courts generally use the predominan ce standard in deter mining whether a party \nis the prevailing party.  Vianix Delaware LLC v. Nuance Commc\u2019ns, Inc. , No. 3801-VCP, 2010 \nWL 3221898, at *28 (Del. Ch. Aug. 13, 2010).  Under th e predominance standard, the Court must \nlook at who prevailed on the main issue in the case \u2013 here, that issue wa s whether the Agreement \nwas a \u201ctime and materials\u201d contra ct that obligated Lam to pay a nd that Lam breached  by failing to \npay.  See Comrie , 2004 WL 5366650, at *2 (\u201cThe main issue in this case \u2013 and the issue upon \nwhich it can be determined the plaintiffs predomin ated in litigation \u2013 is the interpretation of the \nAgreement . . . .\u201d); see also  W. Willow-Bay Ct., LLC v.  Robino-Bay Ct. Plaza, LLC , No. 2742-\nVCN, 2009 WL 458779, at *9 (Del. C h. Feb. 23, 2009) (\u201cWhether West Willow is entitled to fees \nreasonably incurred will be determined in referen ce to the litigation as a whole because the clause \nonly contemplates awarding fees to  the prevailing party in an \u2018a ction.\u2019  There can be no question \nWest Willow prevailed in this matter.  It prevaile d on the substantive breach of contract claim.\u201d).  \nOn the issue of contract interpretation (a nd breach), CIGNEX prevailed.  Indeed, CIGNEX \nprevailed on its breach of cont ract claim and on all countercla ims asserted by Lam.  Although \nCIGNEX did not recover the full amount of dama ges sought, it recovered over half that amount,  7  and damages were only \u201csubsidiary  to contract interpretation.\u201d  W. Willow-Bay , 2009 WL 458779, \nat *9; see also  Comrie , 2004 WL 5366650, at *3.  CIGNEX is the pr evailing party in this litigation. \nB. CIGNEX Has Failed to Prove Its Requested Fees Are Reasonable \nHaving found that CIGNEX is a prevailing part y within the meaning of the Agreement and \nDelaware law, the Court must now turn to the factors set forth in the Delaware Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct to assess whether the fees requested by CIGNEX are reasonable.  It is \nnoteworthy, however, that neither side offered any meaningful di scussion or analysis of these \nfactors or of their application to the facts of this case.  ( Compare  D.I. 147 at 14-19 (CIGNEX \npresenting the proper factors but  failing to apply them), with D.I. 151 at 15-16 (Lam failing to even \nraise the factors or relevant authority in discu ssing reasonableness of the requested fees)).  This \nlack of effort \u2013 coupled with th e absence of legitimate supportin g evidence \u2013 has made the Court\u2019s \njob in reviewing the reasonableness of the requested fees exceedingly difficult.  \n1. Time and Novelty \nCIGNEX\u2019s claim was a straightfo rward breach of contract claim, the resolution of which \nlargely turned on whether the Ag reement was a \u201ctime and material s\u201d contract, as opposed to a \n\u201cfixed price\u201d contract that obligated CIGNEX to complete the project to receive compensation.  \n(See D.I. 126 at 18-25).  Answerin g that question did not prove es pecially difficult given that \nseveral Lam witnesses conceded that the contract was a \u201ctime and materials\u201d contract.  ( See id.  at \n19).  And Lam\u2019s counterclaims turned on whether CIGNEX\u2019s affirmative claim prevailed.  \nOverall, this was not a complex case.  Indeed, neither side called any experts at trial; instead, the parties relied on fact witnesses and a handful of trial exhibits to support their respective claims. \nAlthough this matter wa s straightforward, the Court has no  indication of how much time \nCIGNEX\u2019s various attorneys spent working on this case.  Neither the brief nor the accompanying  8  declaration includes any summation (or any number) of hours worked by each (or any) attorney.  \n(See generally  D.I. 147 & 148).  Even in the purportedl y \u201cdetailed summary of  all invoices paid \nto date\u201d attached to CIGNEX\u2019s declaration, there is no t a single time entry or assertion of how \nmuch time each attorney billed to this matter.  ( See D.I. 148, Ex. A at pgs. 1-3 of 3; see also  D.I. \n148 \u00b6 4 (\u201cI have attached as Exhibit A hereto a de tailed summary of all invoices paid to date in \nthis litigation.\u201d)).  The Court has thus no idea how much time this simple breach of contract case \nrequired of the many attorneys working on it. \n2. Employment Preclusion \nOn this factor, CIGNEX offered a single \u2013 a nd bald \u2013 assertion from its Authorized \nRepresentative:  \u201cIt was apparent to me that the acceptance of the partic ular employment was likely \nto preclude other employment by the attorneys.\u201d  (D.I. 148 \u00b6 15) .  No other information was \nsubmitted to the Court regarding this factor.  In fact, CIGNEX did not bother to address this factor \nin its briefing.  Stated different ly, there is no support in the record  for the Court to  conclude that \nworking on this case precluded other employment.  Indeed, given the lack of complexity (and \nrelatively quiet docket) in this case, the Court finds it hard to believe that this case prevented CIGNEX\u2019s attorneys from handling ot her matters at the same time.\n4   \n3. Fees Customarily Charged \nHourly rates are about the onl y information that CIGNEX did provide in connection with \nits attorneys\u2019 fee motion.  The C ourt will address the hourly  rates of each of the five firms involved \nin this case.  ( See D.I. 148 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 7 & 8). \n\u00a0\n4  In fact, the Court suspects that it would be  able to find active cases involving many of the \nattorneys proceeding at the same time  that this case was in progress.  9  The first firm involved, Honi gman Miller Schwartz and C ohn LLP, is based in Detroit, \nMichigan and it apparently provide d pre-filing legal advice to CIGNE X.  (D.I. 148 \u00b6 5).  According \nto CIGNEX\u2019s Authorized Representative, that fi rm charged $545 per hour for the services they \nprovided.  The problem facing the C ourt, however, is that there is  no indication of whether this \nhourly rate is for a partner or an  associate (or someone else).  CIGNEX does not even provide the \nname of the individual(s) performing the work.  Th e Court is therefore unable to determine whether \nthe $545 hourly rate for Honi gman Miller Schwartz a nd Cohn LLP is reasonable. \nThe next two firms involved were Kegler Brow n Hill & Ritter (\u201cKegler Brown\u201d), which is \nbased in Columbus, Ohio and served as CIGNEX\u2019 s lead counsel until late 2018, and Morris James \nLLP, who served as co-lead and Dela ware counsel during that time.  ( See D.I. 148 \u00b6 6).  At Kegler \nBrown\u2019s discounted rates, senior partners billed  at $400 per hour, partners billed at $313 per hour, \nassociates billed at $257 per hour and pa ralegals billed at $160 per hour.  ( Id.).  At Morris James\u2019s \ndiscounted rates, partners billed  at $440 per hour, asso ciates billed at $375 pe r hour and paralegals \nbilled at $215 per hour.  ( Id.).  In the Court\u2019s experience, these hourly rates for partners, associates \nand paralegals are not excessive in Delaware.  That being said, CIGNEX again fails to provide the \nCourt with the identity of the particular attorney s involved so that the Court can more fully assess \nwhether the hourly rates are r easonable in light of the atto rneys\u2019 experience levels. \nThe fourth firm involved wa s Royzz & Co. of Mumbai, Indi a, which apparently provided \n\u201clegal advice related to this li tigation\u201d sometime  in May 2018.  ( See D.I. 148 \u00b6 7).  There is no \nindication of who performed that work (or even if the work was done by an attorney) and whether \nany hourly rate was used.  Instead, CIGNEX appa rently paid a \u201cnegotiated fee\u201d of $2,936.42.  ( Id.).  \nThe Court is unable to concl ude that any of these Royzz & Co. fees are reasonable.  10  The last firm, Halloran Farkas + Kittila LLP  (\u201cHalloran Farkas\u201d), became involved in \nSeptember 2018 and replaced Kegler Brown and Morris James.  (D.I. 148 \u00b6 8).  Still CIGNEX\u2019s \ncounsel in this matter today, Halloran Farkas billed at a discounted rate of $475 per hour for \npartners and $100 per hour for paralegals.  ( Id.).  These hourly rates are reasonable in Delaware.  \nAlthough the Court knows the ident ity of the particular attorn eys who tried the case, CIGNEX \nagain fails to provide the Court w ith the identity of all the individuals involved so that the Court \ncan more fully evaluated the hourly rates in light of each individual\u2019s experience. \nIn sum, the Court canno t conclude that the hou rly rates used by Honi gman Miller Schwartz \nand Cohn LLP and Royzz & Co. are reasonab le.  Although CIGNEX provided no evidence of \nexperience level for the individuals involved from Kegler Brown, Morris James and Halloran \nFarkas, the hourly rates for partners , associates and paralegals gene rally appear reasonable for the \nDelaware market. \n4. Amount Involved and Results Obtained \nCIGNEX asserted one claim for breach of contract, ultimately seeking $434,096.71.  ( See \nD.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-19).  The Court partially granted summary judgment to La m on one damages issue \nand reduced the potential damages by $58,000.  (D.I. 94 at 6).  At trial, CIGNEX prevailed on its \nbreach of contract claim as related to se rvices rendered under CR-1, CR-2 and CR-3.  ( See D.I. 126 \nat 18-23).  CIGNEX also prevailed on all counterc laims asserted by Lam.  (D.I. 145 \u00b6 1).  The \nCourt awarded $232,039.71 in damages plus $60,564.56 in pre-judgment interest, and post-\njudgment interest was awarded as well.  ( See generally id. ).  Thus, CIGNEX prevailed on the \nmerits of its breach of contract  claim but did not obtain all damages sought.  In the end, CIGNEX \nreceived a little over half of  what it sought in this lit igation \u2013 a mediocre result. \n   11  5. Time Limitations \nThere is no evidence relating to this factor, wh ich does not appear rele vant in this case.  \nThis factor does not weigh in favor  of or against the reasonablene ss of CIGNEX\u2019s requested fees.   \n6. Nature and Length of Relationship with Client \nThe Court has struggled w ith this factor as appl ied to this case.  On the one hand, there is \nno record evidence as to the nature  and length of the professional re lationship present here.  That \nbeing said, the Court suspects there were histor ically some issues with the attorney-client \nrelationships.  Over the course of litigation, there were at least five differ ent law firms involved in \nthis action, which again was a simple  breach of contract case.  ( See D.I. 148 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 7 & 8).  At \none point, CIGNEX apparently attempted to obtain legal advice relating to this litigation from a \nlaw firm in India (where  CIGNEX has offices).  ( Id. \u00b6 7).  Only after two years and four law firms \ndid CIGNEX land on its final set of attorneys that would ultimately try this case.  ( Id. \u00b6 11).  The \nCourt finds that this factor doe s not weigh in favor of the reas onableness of any requested fees. \n7. Experience and Reputation of the Attorneys \nAlthough the CIGNEX attorneys who tried this  case are experienced members of the \nDelaware Bar ( see D.I. 118 at 2:12-14), the Court is unabl e to conclude anything about the other \nattorneys and legal professionals involved.  The main impediment to assessing this factor is the fact that CIGNEX has not identified the individua ls at each of the various firms who performed \nwork on this case.  ( See D.I. 148 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 7 & 8 (listing firm s and generic title s for individuals \nperforming work but providing no names); see also id. , Ex. A at pgs. 1-3 of 3 (no individual names \nlisted on summary of charges)).  The Court cannot  possibly evaluate the experience, reputation \nand skill level of unknown attorneys or other legal prof essionals.  For example, as to the first firm \ninvolved \u2013 before this action was filed \u2013 there is  no indication whether pa rtners or associates  12  provided legal advice regarding the underlying dispute.  ( Id. \u00b6 5).  The same is true with Royzz & \nCo. of Mumbai, India \u2013 the Court has been provided nothing as to  who from that firm performed \nany work on this matter or the experience and reputation those individuals possess.  ( See D.I. 148 \n\u00b6 7 & Ex. A at pg. 3 of 3).  In fact, CIGNEX has failed to  even offer evidence that attorneys  at \neither firm were the ones performing the work.  Th e Court cannot conclude th at this factor supports \nfinding any of the request ed fees reasonable. \n8. Whether Fee is Fixed or Contingent \nIn this case, the fees were based on hourly  rates rather than a ny contingency basis. \nHaving applied each factor to th e evidence here, the Court is left  puzzled as to the contents \nof CIGNEX\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019  fees, particularly given that this is CIGNEX\u2019s second attempt \nat filing its fees motion.  CIGNEX has provided almost no evidence supporting the reasonableness \nof any attorneys\u2019 fees requested.  In addition to the many factors from the Delaware Lawyers\u2019 \nRules of Professional Conduct weighing against CIGNEX, the Court has no information regarding \nhow much time CIGNEX attorneys spent on this cas e.  One would think th at a party seeking its \nattorneys\u2019 fees would provide the Court with the nu mber of hours that said attorneys spent working \non the case.  Apparently not.  But this failure is particularly detrimental to CIGNEX\u2019s motion because, after evaluating the above factors, the Court asks whether the amount of time devoted to \nlitigation was \u201cexcessive, redundant, duplic ative or otherwise unnecessary.\u201d  Mahani , 935 A.2d at \n247-48.  The Court is obviously  unable to do so here. \nIn the end, the Court is only able to conclude  that some of CIGNEX\u2019s requested attorneys\u2019 \nfees are unreasonable, with the remainder being unsupported as reas onable.  As to Royzz & Co. \nof Mumbai, India, the Court is left in the dark as  to why an Indian firm was consulted in the middle \nof U.S. litigation between two U.S. co mpanies involving a U.S. contract.  ( See D.I. 148 \u00b6 7 & Ex.  13  A at pg. 3 of 3).  Lacking any satisfactory explanati on, the Court finds th at none of the $2,936.42 \npaid to Royzz & Co. is reasonable.  Similarly, because CIGNEX has not provided evidence as to \nthe reasonableness of the hourly rates (or hours) of  Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP \u2013 or \neven that attorneys performed the work \u2013 the Cour t cannot find the $4,938.42 paid to be reasonable.  \n(See D.I. 148 \u00b6 5 & Ex. A at pg. 1 of 3).  And as to the remainder of the atto rneys\u2019 fees requested \nby CIGNEX, the Court is wholly unable to determin e whether \u2013 or to what extent \u2013 the requested \nfees are reasonable.  Under the circumstances  and based on the evidence provided, the Court \nbelieves that allowing  any of the remaining requested fees  would be an abuse of discretion.5   \nFinally, the Court will briefly address costs under Rule 54(d)(1).  CIGNEX has not filed a \nbill of costs, and there is no separate request for costs in CIGNEX\u2019s motion or in the supporting \ndocumentation.  Although there is reference in the declaration to  Wilcox and Fetzer (a court \nreporting service), the only inform ation provided is three dates, the description \u201cLegal Fees : \nMatter : Lam Research\u201d and the amount paid ( $4,870.00).  (D.I. 148, Ex. A at pg. 3 of 3).  Without \na description of what Wilcox an d Fetzer did to receive that  $4,870.40, the Court is unable to \ndetermine whether that sum (or a ny portion of it) is a taxable co st that CIGNEX should be allowed \nto recover.  No costs for Wilcox and Fetzer work  will be allowed.  To the extent that CIGNEX had \nplanned on submitting a bill of costs after dispos ition of this motion, that was an error.  See D. Del. \nL.R. 54.1(a)(1) (\u201cThe [prevailing] party shall, with in 14 days after the time for appeal has expired \nor within 14 days after the issuance of the mandate of the appellate court, file a bill of costs.  Failure \n\u00a0\n5  This is true even for Halloran Farkas \u2013 which seemed to have reasonable hourly rates \u2013 \nbecause the Court has no indication of how ma ny hours the attorneys spent on this case.  \nNor any indication of how many hours paralegals  spent on the case.  Indeed, the Court has \nno indication of how many individua ls staffed this case.  In f act, not having the number of \nhours spent on this matt er means that the Court cannot ev en check CIGNEX\u2019s math on the \namount of fees requested for Halloran Fa rkas services (among others).     14  to comply with the time limitations of this Rule shall constitute a waiver of costs, unless the Court \notherwise orders or counsel are able to agree on the payment of costs.\u201d).  CIGNEX filed no bill of costs within fourteen days of the issuance of the mandate and it is too late to do so now.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, CIGNEX\u2019s renewed mo tion for attorneys\u2019 fees is DENIED.  An \nappropriate order will follow.
