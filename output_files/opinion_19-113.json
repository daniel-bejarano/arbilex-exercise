(D.I. 29) .  For the \nreasons that follow, the Motion is GRANTED -IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn March 15, 2019, Plaintiffs Amy Spahr and Matthew Cain (\u201cPlai ntiffs\u201d) filed this \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action  against Defendants Amy Collins, Romona Mirro,1 and Jane Powell \n(\u201cDefendants\u201d), alleging that Defendants deprived them of their Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights.  Defendants are all family service specialis ts who were employed by the State \nof Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families (\u201cDFS\u201d).  (D.I. 3  \n\u00b6\u00b6 3\u20135).  \nPlaintiffs are the parents of C.C., and Plaintiff Spahr is the mother  of S.S., who were eleven -\nmonths -old a nd seven years old, respectively, at the time of r elevant events.2  (Id. \u00b6 7).  On \nJanuary  17, 2018, Plaintiff s allege that Defendant Collins  came to Plaintiff Spahr\u2019s  home, \ndemanded to speak with her, and after Spahr  declined  to do so, Collins responded that she would \nreturn with police .  (Id. \u00b6 8).  Col lins did just that, returning hours later with several police officers \nwho were met by Plaintiff Cain after knocking on the door.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 10 \u201311).  Collins insisted on \nentering the home to examine its cleanliness, Cain refused entry, but after calling the home\u2019s co-owner, Thomas Redden (Plaintiff Spahr\u2019s father), and obtaining his permission, Collins entered \nand examined the house and deemed  it a suitable living space.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 12 \u201318).  After leaving, \n \n1  The Complaint incorrectly spells Ms. Mirro\u2019s name as \u201cRamona Mira.\u201d  (D.I. 7).  \n2  Because C.C. and S.S. are minors, the Court will use their abbreviated names. 2 Collins then w ent to S.S.\u2019s school and interviewed the child  without Plaintiff Spahr\u2019s consent .  \n(Id. \u00b6 20).   \nLater t hat evening, Plaintiff Spahr attempted to pick up C.C. from Redden\u2019s house, but  no \none answered the door.  Plaintiffs claim that no one at the Redden home answered the door because \nCollins instru cted Redden\u2019s  family that C.C. would be put into foster care if they spoke with Spahr \nor did not themselves take custody of C.C.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21\u201330).   Spahr  then returned to her own home  \nwhere she  found Collins waiting for her .  Plaintiffs allege  that Collins then presented  Spahr  with a \nChild Safety Agreement  and threatened Spahr that her children would be sent to foster care if she \ndid not sign it.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21 \u201328).   According to Plaintiffs, Spahr was not given time to review the \nplan and could not  read it because  it was dark outside.  ( Id. \u00b6 30).   Collins ultimately  signed the \nagreement.  \nThe Child Safety Agreement , attached to the Complaint, provides further context.  In a \nsection entitled \u201cWhat is caus ing immediate safety threats to the child(ren)?\u201d, Collins w rote \u201cAmy \nand Matthew Cain have ongoing domestic violence and children are present.  S.S. has been in between the fights trying to stop fights.  Concerns for children who may be harmed during domes tic incidents.\u201d  ( Id., Ex. 1).  The plan provides that S.S. \u2019s natural father  will keep S.S. \u201cuntil \nfurther notice\u201d and that C.C. will reside with the Redden family (Spahr\u2019s father and stepmother)  \n\u201cuntil DFS completes its investigation can [sic] deemed the child safe.\u201d  ( Id.)  The plan further \nprovides that \u201c[i]f A my attempts to remove C.C. from maternal grandparents care they will call \nDFS and 911.\u201d   By the plan\u2019s terms, the agreement was to be ef fective for a maximum of thirty \ndays after signature.  The plan also provides that \u201cthe agreement will be reviewed to de termine if \nthe agreement will continue, be amended, terminated, or a new agreement will be developed.\u201d  \n(Id.).  Plaintiffs assert the plan was voluntary and could be rescinded at any time.  ( Id. \u00b6 31).    3 Days later, after consulting with a lawyer, Plaintif fs informed Defendants that they wanted \ntheir children returned immediately.  ( Id. \u00b6 35).  But Plaintiffs assert that \u201c[f]or the next 21  days, \nDefendants . . . actively prevented Plaintiffs . . . from recovering their minor children.\u201d  More \nspecifically, P laintiffs allege  that Defendants misrepresented to the Delaware State Police, Dover \nPolice Department, and Redden that there was a court  order separating Plaintiffs from their minor \nchildren .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 40 \u201341, 46, 47).  The net result of this, per Plaintiffs , is that Defendants \n\u201cunlawfully detain[ed] S.S. and C.C. from the care of their parents.\u201d  Meanwhile, Plaint iffs and \nDefendants agree t hat \u201cDFS never filed any documentation with the Family Court prohibiting \nSpahr and Cain from seeing C.C.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 53; D. I. 7 \u00b6 53).   \nUltimately, Plaintiffs were able to reunite with their children  after twenty -one days .  \nThough not  clearly  described  in the Complaint, it appears that a judge became involved at some \npoint , as Plaintiffs allege that \u201c[Defendant] Powell called  the Dover Police Department and \nadvised them on what the judge had ordered.\u201d   (Id. \u00b6 54).  This led officers to accompany Plaintiff \nCain to Redden\u2019s home to retrieve C.C. and return the child to parental custody.  Plaintiffs allege \nthat the ordeal  caused Plaintiff Cain to lose  his employment, inflicted  severe emotional distress on \nPlaintiffs and their children, and caused las ting damage to the relationship between Plaintiffs and \nThomas Redden.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 55 \u201357).       \nPlaintiffs brought a procedural due proc ess, unlawful removal, familial association , and \nMonell claim against all three Defendants.  Defendants filed an answer to the Complaint (D.I. 7) \nand moved for judgment on the pleadings.  (D.I. 2 9).  That motion is now before the Court. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA mo tion for judgment on the pleadings should be granted if the movant establishes that \n\u201cthere are no material issues of fact, and he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  Zimmerman 4 v. Corbett , 873 F.3d 414, 417 (3d Cir. 2017).  A motion for judgment on the pleadings that asserts \nthat the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is reviewed under t he \n12(b)(6) standard.  Turbe v. Gov \u2019t of Virgin Islands , 938 F.2d 427, 428 (3d Cir. 1991) .  Thus, for \nthe Complaint to survive a moti on for judgment on the pleadings, it must \u201cstate a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.\u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twom bly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is \nplausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the rea sonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009).  In reviewing the Complaint, the Court must accept as true all factual allegations and \nview those facts in the light most favorable to  the non- moving party.  Rocks v. City of Philadelphia, \n868 F.2d 644, 645 (3d Cir.1989).  But courts are \u201cnot bound to accept as true a legal conclusion \ncouched as a factual allegation\u201d and \u201cthreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supporte d by mere conclusory statements do not suffice\u201d for the purposes of pleading factual \nmatter.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678\u201379.  \nThe Court\u2019s standard of review is different for defendants who plead absolute and qualified \nimmunity.  Defendant Powell contends that she is entitled to either absolute or qualified immunity and Defendants Collins and Mirro assert that they deserv e qualified immunity.  \u201c[T]o earn the \nprotections of absolute  immunity \u2019 at the  motion -to-dismiss  stage, a defendant must show that the \nconduct triggering absolute  immunity  clearly appear[s] on the face of the complaint.\u201d  Weimer v. \nCty. of Fayette, Pennsyl vania, 972 F.3d 177, 187 (3d Cir. 2020)  (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  With respect to qualified immunity, \u201c[u]nless the plaintiff \u2019s allegations state a \nclaim of violation of clearly established law, a defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled \nto dismissal before the commencement of discovery.\u201d  Mitchell v. Forsyth , 472 U.S. 511, 526 \n(1985).   5   6 III. DISCUSSION  \nCount I asse rts a procedural due process, unlawful removal, and familial association claim \nagainst each Defendant.  Count II asserts a Monell claim against each Defendant.  The Court will \naddress each claim in tur n.3 \nA. Procedural Due Process  \nDefendants move for judgment  on the pleadings on Plaintiffs\u2019 procedural due process \nclaim.  To raise a procedural due process claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that \u201c(1) he \nwas deprived of an individual interest that is encompassed within the Fourt eenth Amendment \u2019s \nprotection of \u2018life, liberty, or property,\u2019 and (2) the procedures available to him did not provide \n\u2018due process of law.\u2019\u201d   Hill v. Borough of Kutztown, 455 F.3d 225, 233\u201334 (3d Cir.2006).   \nThe law recognizes \u201cthe constitutionally protec ted liberty interests that p arents have in the \ncustody, care and management of their children[,]\u201d though this interest is \u201c limited by the \ncompelling governmental interest in the protection of children \u2013 particularly where the children \nneed to be protected from their own parents.\u201d   Croft v. Westmoreland Cty. Child. & Youth Servs ., \n103 F.3d 1123, 1125 (3d Cir. 2003).  Much like other areas of the law where rights are not absolute, the importance of process is amplified.  Thus, \u201c[t]he procedural component of parental due process rights [ ] requires rigorous adherence to procedural safeguards anytime the state seeks to alter, \nterminate, or suspend a parent \u2019s right to the custody of his minor children.\u201d  McCurdy v. Dodd, \n352 F.3d 820, 827 (3d Cir. 2003).   \n \n3  The Court reaches the merits because sovereign immunity does not apply in this case. \n\u201c[T]he Eleventh Amendment does not erect a barrier  against suits to impose \u2018 individual \nand personal liability \u2019 on st ate officials under  \u00a7 1983.\u201d  Hafer v. Melo , 502 U.S. 21, 31 \n(1991)  (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs have sued Defendants in their individual capacities, \nso sovereign immunity cannot shield Defendants from liability.  7 Here, P laintiffs\u2019 procedural due pr ocess claim rests on the allegations that Plaintiff Spahr \nwas coerced into signing the Child Safety Agreement.  Plaintiffs  allege that Defendant Collins told \nPlaintiff Spahr that her children would be sent to foster care if Plai ntiff did not sign off on the \nChild Safety Agreement , and that she was given no time to read the agreement .  Plaintiffs further \nallege that Plaintiff Spahr was given an ultimatum and coerced into signing away her \nconstitutionally protected liberty interest  in the care and custody of her children without an \nopportunity to even read the agreement.  The agreement\u2019s terms specified that it would remain in \neffect for thirty days and that the agreement would be reviewed prior to its expiration, but , at this \nstage of the proceedings, it appe ars that no  meaningful review occurred.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs \nhave stated a procedural due process claim against Defendant Collins that relate to the allegations that Plaintiff was coerced into singing the Child Safety A greement.  Because these allegati ons \nrelate solely to Defendant Collins\u2019 actions, however, and not those of Defendants Mirro and \nPowell, the procedural due process claims against both Mirro and Powell  must be dismissed . \nMoreover, the Court finds that Defendant Collins is not entitled to q ualified immunity at \nthis stage of the proceedings because the Complaint states a violation of rights that were sufficiently clear at the time of the alleged violation.  See Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 11 (2015) (\u201cA clear ly established right is one that is \u2018sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would \nhave understood that what he is doing violates that right.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); Sharrar v. Felsing, 128 F.3d 810, 826 (3d Cir. 1997) (explaining that qualified i mmunity is appropriate when \ngover nment officials\u2019 conduct \u201cdoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional \nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d).  In Croft v. Westmoreland Cty. Child. \n& Youth Servs ., the Third Circuit sta ted that \u201cremoving the suspected parent from the family home \nduring the pendency of child abuse investigations absent any procedural safeguards raises a 8 procedural due process issue.\u201d  103 F.3d 1123, 1126 n. 3 (3d Cir. 1997).  Croft involved a case \nwhere t he Defendant, lacking any objecti vely reasonable grounds to believe the child had been \nsexually abused or was in imminent danger of such abuse, gave the child\u2019s father an ultimatum to \nleave the house and stay away from his daughter or her daughter would be  put in foster care.  \nCourts have  interpreted Croft to clearly provide that \u201ca coerced safety plan involving separation \nof parent(s) from child violates federally protected rights if it is presented to the parents without legal authority,\u201d and have denied qualified immunity at the motion -to-dismiss stage to Defendants \nin cases alleging violations of the procedural due process right spelled out in Croft .  See Isbell v. \nBellino , 983 F. Supp. 2d 492, 513 (M.D. Pa. 2012); Starkey v. York Cty. , No. 1:11- CV-00981, \n2011 WL 11071762, at *7\u20138 (M.D.  Pa. Sept. 21, 2011) .  Thus, the Court will grant the motion as \nto the procedural  due process claims against Mirro and Powell and deny it as to Collins .  \nB. Substantive Due Process Claims: Unlawful Removal and Familial Associa tion \nPlaintiffs appear to be asserting a substantive due process claim against all Defendants for \nviolating Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cright to be free from the removal of the children from their family home . . . without first obtaining a warrant or other court order t o do so\u201d and \u201cunlawfully detain[i ng] S.S. \nfrom the care of their parents.\u201d  (D.I. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 59, 63 ).  Regarding the allegedly unlawful  removal, \nPlaintiffs assert  that Defendant Collins removed their children  without a valid court order  or any \nother legally sufficient basis .  With respect to th e allegations of \u201cunlawful detaining,\u201d Plaintiffs \nallege that the  falsehoods  Defendants told  to Redden and police officers obstructed Plaintiffs\u2019 \nability to rescind the voluntary Child Safety Agreement and retrieve their child.  Plaintiffs assert violation s of two rights protected by the substantive due process component of the Fourteenth \nAmendment: that Defendants\u2019 removal was unlawful and that Defendants\u2019 subsequent act ions \nviolated their  right of familial association . 9 1. Unlawful Removal  \nTo prevail on their  substantive due process claim with respect to the removal of their \nchildren, Plaintiffs must show that the Defendants\u2019 decision- making was so clearly arbitrary that \nit shocks the conscience.  See Miller v. City of Philadelphia , 174 F.3d 368, 374\u201376 (3d Ci r 1999).  \nThis standard is met when state actors interfere with the parental relationship without \u201csome \nreasonable and articulable evidence giving rise to a reasonable s uspicion that a child has been \nabused or is in imminent danger of abuse.\u201d  Croft , 103 F .3d at 1126.   Thus, the Court\u2019s focus \u201cis \nwhether the information available to the defendants at the time would have created an objectively reasonable suspicion of abuse  justifying the degree of interference with the [Plaintiffs\u2019] rights as \n[] parents.\u201d  I d.   \nViewing the evidence as the Court must when reviewing this  motion, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have plausibly stated a substantive due process claim against Def endant Collins with \nrespect to the removal of children from the home.  To separate a ch ild from their guardian, social \nworkers must have a reasonable and articulable basis for believing a child is in danger of abuse.  \nIn Croft , the d efendant acted on a six -fold hearsay report by an anonymous informant, and the \nThird Circuit held that summary  judgment on plaintiff\u2019s substantive due process claims in \ndefendant\u2019s favor  was inappropriate because the hearsay report did not give rise to a reasonable \nand articulab le suspicion of abuse.  103 F.3d at 1126 \u2013 27.   \nAt this stage of the proceeding, t he Court has no way to discern the reasonableness of \nCollins\u2019 basis for seeking to alter Plaintiffs\u2019 parental rights.  Although the Child Safety Agreement reveals that \u201cAmy and Matthew Cain have ongoing domestic violence and children are present.  [S.S] has be en in between the fights trying to stop fights.  Concerns for children who may be \nharmed during domestic incidents,\u201d it does not reveal the basis for those beliefs.  Hav ing already 10 determined that there is a clearly established right to be free from having  children removed without \nany reasonable and articulable evidence giving rise to a suspicion of abuse, and not having in the \nrecord any evidence that there was any reasonable basis for Defendant Collins\u2019 decision, the Court must deny Defendant Collins\u2019 mot ion.  It may be entirely possible , or even likely, that discovery \nwill produce evidence indicating a reasonable and articulable basis for Collins\u2019 belief, but until such evidence is  in the record, granting Collins\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings woul d be \npremature.   As to the other Defendants , Mirro and Powell , Plaintiffs do not allege that they were \ninvolved in removing C.C. from Plaintiffs\u2019 custody , and the Court will grant t heir motion on the \nunlawful removal claim.  \n2. Familial Association  \nNext, the C ourt must determine whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently ple aded a \u201cfamilial \nassociation\u201d claim regarding  the Plaintiffs\u2019 inability to reunite with their children after the initial \nremoval.  The thrust of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations on this point is that they were not able to rescind the purportedly voluntary Child Safety Agreement because Defendants misrepresent ations led Redden \nto refuse to re turn C.C. to Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs also could not get police officers\u2019 intervention \nbecause Defendants \u2019 misrepres entations  led police officers to refuse to aid in their efforts.  This, \nper Plaintiffs, violated their right of familial association protected by the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nThe Court grants Defendants\u2019 moti on for judgment on the pleadings because Plaintiffs have  \nfailed to show  that Defendants violated Plaintif fs\u2019 clearly established right  of familial association .  \nA right is clearly established when the law is \u201csufficiently clear that every reasonable offici al \nwould have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d   Reichle v. Howards , 566 U.S. \n658, 664 (2012) .  As explained earlier, Plaintiffs substantive due process claims may only be 11 sustained if they have pleaded conduct that \u201cshocks the conscie nce.\u201d  Newman  v. Beard , 617 F.3d \n775 (3d Cir. 2010).  The Court grants Defendants \u2019 motion for three reasons.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs do  not attempt to show how the allegations regarding \u201cunlawful detaining\u201d \nviolated Plaintiffs\u2019 clearly established rights.  To sh ow that a right is \u201cclearly established\u201d for the \npurposes of qualified immunity, the Supreme Court has stressed the importance of case law that \nplaces the statutory or constitutional question at issue beyond debate.  See White v. Pauly , 137 S.Ct. \n548, 551 (2017).  Plaintiffs ha ve cited no case law whatsoever to support their position.  \u201cIt is not \nenough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel\u2019s work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\u201d  United  States v. \nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied , 494 U.S. 1082 (1990).  Because Plaintiffs \nhave not attempted to develop the \u201cunlawful detaining\u201d claim in any way, the  claim must be \ndismissed against all Defendants.  \nSecond, even if the Court were to look past Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to develop the  \nclaim, the Court is skeptical that Plaintiffs have pleaded  conduct that \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d with \nrespect to the familial association claim.  The Child Safety Agreement , which Plaintiffs attached \nto the Complaint, states that \u201c[The Redden family] will not allow C.C. to be removed from their care until DFS completes its investigation and can deemed [sic] the child safe.  If Amy attempts \nto remove C.C. from maternal gra ndparents care they will call DFS and 911.\u201d   Plaintiffs allege \nthat Defendants told Redden and various police officers that there w as a court order separating \nPlaintiffs from their children, even though there was no actual court order.  Although the Child \nSafety Agreement is no court order, it does not \u201cshock the conscience\u201d that family service \nspecialists would confuse the two in the  midst of their high- pressure  jobs.   12 Last, i f Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cunlawful detaining\u201d claim is based on the Fourth Amendment, as \nPlaintiffs somewhat suggest ( see D.I. 3 \u00b6  59), there is another reason to dismiss that  claim against \nall Defendants.  Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights.  See Alderman v. United States , 394 \nU.S. 165, 174 (1969)  (\u201cFourth Amendment rights are personal  rights which . . . may not be \nvicariously asserted .\u201d).  Plaintiffs  do not allege that they themselves were unlawfully detained, but \nthat their children were.   But because Fourth Amendment rights are personal, they cannot be \nvicariously asserted.  See Southerland v. City of New York , 680 F.3d 127, 143 (2d Cir. 2012)  \n(\u201cA Fourth Amendment  child -seizure claim  belongs only to the  child, not to the  parent, although \na parent  has standing to assert it on the  child \u2019s behalf.\u201d).   The child allegedly seized is not a party \nto this action.  Because Plaintiffs do not purport to bring suit on behalf of their children, any claim  \nbased on the ir childr en\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights must be dismissed . \nAccordingly, the Court grants Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings on \nPlaintiff\u2019s  familial association claim.  \nC. Monell  Claim  \nPlaintiffs also bring a Monell claim against Defendants in their individual capacities.  The \nclaim alleges that Defendants established or followed policies, procedures, customs, usages,  and \npractices that were the moving force of the deprivations of constitutional rights that Plaintiffs  \nsuffered.  Plaintiffs\u2019 Monell claim , however, must be dismissed because it is no Monell claim at \nall.  In Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. Of City of New York , the Supr eme Court held that \u00a7 1983 \nclaims may be brought against political subdivisions and their  officials sued in their official \ncapacities.  436 U.S. 658, 690\u201391 (1978).  Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted Monell  claim is brought against all \nthree Defendants in their individual capacities and therefore cannot stand as pleaded .  See \nSpeakman v. Williams , 440 F.Supp.3d 376, 390 n.15 (D. Del. 2020) (explaining that the complaint 13 did not state a Monell claim against two defendants \u201cbecause Count III is a Monell claim and both \nWilliams and Goode are sued in their individual capacities.\u201d).  Therefore, Defendants\u2019 motio n for \njudgment on the pleadings is granted with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 Monell  claims.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the plea dings  is DENIED -\nIN-PART and GRANTED- IN-PART.  An appropriate order will be entered. "}
