(D.I. 25).  The motion is fully briefed.  ( Id., D.I. \n27, 29, 32).  I heard oral argument on the motion on July 11, 2022.  The parties have agreed that \nno evidentiary hearing is  necessary.   (D.I. 34).  \n The motion seeks to suppress firearms seized from Defendant\u2019s home, an incriminating \nstatement Defendant gave the police after his warrantless arrest, and the contents of two iPhones \nthat were seized \u201cin plain view\u201d at the time of his arrest, which were later searched pursuant to a \nsearch warrant that is not independently challenged.\n1  The parties\u2019 positions could not be  further \napart.  The main points of dispute are (1) whether there was probable cause at the time of \nDefendant\u2019s arrest to believe that Defendant  had committed  a crime , and (2) whether the fruits of \nthe search warrant for Defendant\u2019s home should be suppressed because there was no substantial \nbasis for th e issuance of the warrant, and, if there was no substantial basis, whether the search is \nsaved by the good faith exception.  \n \n1 There was also a search warrant for Defendant\u2019s DNA .  It is not challenged.  Page 2 of 6  \n  The search warrant for the home was obtained November 17, 2020.  (D.I. 25, Exh. I).  \nDefendant was arrested without a warrant on N ovember 19, 2020, at 9:20 a.m.  (D.I. 25, Exh. \nIX).  Later the same day, at 10:02 a.m., police executed the search warrant at the home, which \nconcluded in about fifty minutes .  (D.I. 25, Exh. IX ).  On November 24, 2020, police obtained \nthe search warrant t o search the two iPhones seized on November 19 th.  (D.I. 25, Exh. II).   \nThe Government agreed at oral argument that if the  arrest on the 19th  was without \nprobable cause, the statement  that followed the arrest must be suppressed.  ( See also  D.I. 27 at \n11).  Defendant\u2019s only challenge to the statement is that it was the product of an illegal arrest.  \nThe essence of the probable cause dispute is based on the following facts , most of which \nare recited in the probable cause affidavit  signed on November 17th .  (D.I. 25, Exh. I).  There \nwas a shooting of an adult and a juvenile , who were together in a car  with a third person , in New \nCastle County on November 4 th.  (Id. \u00b6 3).  There were two volleys of gunfire directed at the \nthree occupants of the car , and two clusters of spent cartridge casings, which were of three \ndifferent dimension s.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 5 -8, 12). Two of the three sets of casings were \u201ca ballistic match\u201d \nwith shell casings obtained from other crime scenes. ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18).  The adult shooting victim \nstated that the day before  he had had an \u201caltercation\u201d with \u201cseveral subjects\u201d in a nearby \nneighborhood,2 and they \u201cmay have been responsible for the shooting incident.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b611 ).  One \nshell casing had DNA which was identified through  CODIS as being that of Defendant.  ( Id. \n\u00b619).  A stolen Kia Sorrento thought to be connected to the shooters was identified and \nrecovered .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13-17, 20- 21, 23).  It yield ed a fingerprint of an other in dividual . (Id., \u00b6 21).  \nThat individual disclaimed any knowledge of the shooting. ( D.I. 25 at 4 ; D.I. 25, Exh. II , \u00b6 20).  \nDefendant\u2019s residence was verified, including his recent sighting at it.  (D.I. 25, Exh. I , \u00b6 24).  \n \n2 Per Google Maps, t he neighborhood, Rosegate, is about sixteen miles from Defendant\u2019s home.  Page 3 of 6  \n Individuals who possess firearms often have various evidence relating to that possession in their \nresidences or vehicles.   (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31 ).  One additional  and undisputed fact, not recited in the \nprobable cause affidavit, is that the County Police knew that Defendant was on feder al \nsupervised release by November 9 th. (D.I. 25, Exh. VI ; D.I. 27- 1).  Whether the County Police \nknew what he was on federal supervised release for ( broadly stated, straw purchasing firearms \nand conspiracy to distribute heroin ( United States v. Harmon, No.  14-cr-43, D.I. 29 (D.  Del.  Mar . \n12, 2015) ) is not in the record .   \n\u201cProbable cause to arrest exists when the facts and circumstances within the arresting \nofficer \u2019s knowledge are sufficient in themselves to warrant a reasonable person to believe that an \noffense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.\u201d  Orsatti v. New Jersey State  \nPolice , 71 F.3d 480, 483 (3d Cir. 1995).   \nI think, for probable cause purposes, a CODIS identification of an unknown DNA \ncontributor is more than enough to e stablish that the DNA came from the identified person. I am \nnot the first federal judge to come to that conclusion .  \u201c[C]ourts  both within this federal circuit \nand in New Jersey have concluded that a preliminary CODIS DNA match can itself be sufficient \nto support a finding of probable cause where the DNA sample being tested came from evidence \nreasonably connected to the alleged c rime. \u201d  Williams  v. Reinhardt , 2017 WL 452004, at *3 \n(D.N.J. Feb. 2, 2017)  (citing two cases).  \nI think, notwithstanding the possibility of transference of DNA, that the DNA on the shell \ncasing establishes, for probable cause purposes, that Defendant touche d the shell casing.  Does \nthis make Defendant one of the shooters, or show that he was present at the scene?  Not \nnecessarily.  But that is not the right question. Does Defendant\u2019s contact with the shell casing create a \u201cfair probability\u201d that he was a par ticipant in the shootings?  See Illinois v. Gates, 462 Page 4 of 6  \n U.S. 213, 238, 246 (1983)  (requiring a \u201cfair probability \u201d of wrongdoing for probable cause but \nnot the \u201c certainty we associate with formal trials\u201d) .  Relying upon common sense, I think the \nanswer is yes.  A person who is going to use, or might need to use, a firearm is likely going to \nwant to be sure that it is properly loaded and ready for use.  I would expect that such a person would generally self -load the gun.  It\u2019s possible that someone else could have loaded the gun.  \nIt\u2019s possible that Defendant could have handled the ammunition before the gun was loaded. It\u2019s possible that  Defendant could have innocently lent his gun to another person, or that persons \nunknown stole the gun from him.  Such possibilities go to whether the Government would be able to prove a  case at trial.  But I do not think these possibilities detract from the most likely \nexplanation of Defendant\u2019s DNA being on the shell casing i s that he loaded the firearm and was \none of the shooters.\n3  I conclude that the re was a fair probability that Defendant was one of the \nshooters , and therefore the arrest was valid  and the subsequent statement will not be suppressed.   \nWhen Defendant was arrested in his vehicle, the police seized two iPhones that were \u201cin \nplain view.\u201d  (D.I. 25, Exh. VI).  The police could not search the iPhones without a search warrant . See Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 403 (2014).  But they could seize them \u201cto \nprevent destruction of evidence while seeking a warrant.\u201d  Id . at 388.  That is what the officers \ndid here.  Five days after their seizure, the police obtained a search warrant for the two iPhones.  \n(D.I. 25, Exh. II).  While the police had additional inculpatory evidence by November 24th , the \nsame reasons that justified  searching the phones as a repository of us eful evidence November \n24th existed on November 19th  and would have then been immediately apparent to an \n \n3 As it turned out, Defendant had a convincing alibi for why he could not have been one of the \nshooters.  Page 5 of 6  \n experienced police officer as justification for a  \u201cplain view\u201d seizure so that the  iPhones  could be \nlater lawfully searched.    I do not think there is a basis to suppress the seizure of the two iPhones.  \nI turn now to the search warrant for the home.   \nWhen faced with a challenge to a [state court judge\u2019s] probable cause \ndetermination, a reviewing court must remember that its role  is limited. It is not to \nconduct a  de novo review. Rather, it simply ensures that the [state court judge]  had a \nsubstantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. Of course, such deference \ndoes not mean that reviewing courts should simply rubbe r stamp a [state court judge\u2019s] \nconclusions. But it does mean that the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this \narea should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.  \n \nUnited  States  v. Jones , 994 F.2d 1051, 1055 (3d Cir. 1993)  (cleaned up ; citations omitted ).  \nThe determination that there was probable cause to arrest Defendant leaves little room for \nDefendant\u2019s argument to suppress the fruits of the search of Defendant\u2019s home.  There was a \nsubstantial basis for the Ju stice of the Peace\u2019s issuance of the warrant.  Unlike an  arrest, which \nonly requires  probable cause to believe Defendant committed a crime, a search warrant requires  \nboth probable cause to believe a crime was committed  and that the place to be searched wil l \nproduce evidence of the crime.  The evidence of  probable cause is limited to the four corners of \nthe search warrant .  I believe the CODIS identification provides evidence of Defendant\u2019s \nconnection to the crime .  Defendant\u2019s  home is the logical place to expect to find evidence of \nDefendant\u2019s connection to the firearm and ammunition used in the crime.  See id. at  1056 \n(\u201cfirearms [] are . . . the type[] of evidence likely to be kept in a suspect \u2019s residence\u201d) .  The \nJustice of the Peace could give \u201cconsiderable weight to the conclusions of [an] experienced \n[police officer ] regarding where evidence of a crime is likely to be found and is entitled to draw \nreasonable inferences abo ut where evidence is likely to be k ept, based on the nature of the \nevidence and the type of offense .\u201d  United  States  v. Whitner, 219 F.3d 289, 296 (3d Cir. 2000) Page 6 of 6  \n (quoting an earlier case).  I conclude that there was a substantial basis for the issuance of the \nwarrant.4 \n Defendant argues that the search warrant was overbroad because of its inclusion of \npotential electronic evidence.  ( D.I. 25 at 11- 14).  To the extent the argument is that the warrant \nwas overbroad, it is of no moment because what the police seized and the Government  plans to \nuse at trial  \u2013 a firearm, maybe some ammunition  \u2013 is not the subject of the arguably overbroad \nparts of the search warrant.  Thus, the firearm (and ammunition , assuming some was seized) \nwould not be suppressed even if the electronics seized pursuant to the warrant were suppressed.  \nSee United States v. Christine, 687 F.2d 749, 758- 59 (3d Cir. 1982)  (authorizing \u201credaction\u201d) .5   \n Defendant also argues, somewhat in passing, that the search warrant was a general \nwarrant.  (D.I. 25 at 12).  This argument primarily relies upon the words \u201cany evidence\u201d \nappearing in the search warrant.  But I think that is a misreading of the search warr ant, which \nauthorizes the filming of \u201cany evidence located,\u201d which I would interpret to refer to the more \nspecific listing of evidence to be seized .  Thus, whatever evidence the police seized pursuant to \nthe warrant could be filmed.  Defendant\u2019s reading of  the warrant as giving the police discretion \nto seize any thing is unsound.  Thus, the search warrant is not a general warrant.   \n For the above reasons, the motion to suppress (D.I. 25) is DENIED.  \n        /s/ Richard G. Andrews _______ \n        United States District Judge  \n \n4 Thus, I do not need to consider whether the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception applies .  (See D.I. 27 at 10-\n11). \n \n5 Defendant also argue s that the warrant did not specify that it was supposed to be executed in \nthe daytime.  (D.I. 25 at 6 n. 36).  While the second page of the Application does not have a \n\u201ccross-out\u201d of the permission to execute at nighttime, the search warrant itself states that the \nsearch is it so be in the \u201cday time.\u201d  (D.I. 25, Exh. I ).  And there is no dispute that the search \nwarrant was executed in the daytime.  I do not think there is any constitutional error  in \nconnection with authorization or execution relating to the time of execution.  "}
