KENNELLY, District Judge:  \n XMTT sued Intel for infringement  of two patents concerning computer memory \narchitecture for hybrid serial and parallel processing systems.   Intel petitioned for, and \nwas granted, inter partes review o f one of the patents.  During that review, the Patent \nTrial and Appeal Board  (PTAB, or Board)  proposed its own construction of certain \nterms, and it subsequently relied on those constructions in ultimately rejecting Intel 's \npetition.  The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB's decision on the basis of judicial \nestoppel.  \nIntel now asks this Court to engage in a supplemental round of claim construction \nand adopt the PTAB's constructions .  XMTT opposes these constructions and argues \nthat the plain language of the terms is sufficient.   For the foregoing reasons, the Court \nconcludes that  additional construction is not warranted.  \nBackground  \n In November 2018, XMTT sued Intel for infringement of two patents .  Known in \nthis litigation as the '879 and ' 388 patents , both  patents  \"generally relate to computing Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 1 of 15 PageID #: 91262 \n and more specifically to a computer memory architecture for hybrid serial and parallel \ncomputing system s.\"  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 39 (dkt. no. 1)  (discussing U.S. patent numbers  \n7,707,388 and 8,145,879) .  In May 2020,  the judge to whom this case was previously \nassigned issued a decision on the parties ' original request for claim construction, which \nconcerned five terms.  See XMTT , Inc. v. Intel Corp. , No. 18- CV-1810 -RGA, 2020 WL \n2404825 (D. Del. May 12, 2020).   \nLater that May, Intel filed a petition to institute an inter partes  review of all thirty -\nnine claims in the ' 388 patent .  Intel argued for invalidity based on four existing \ncomputer processing system patents ( labeled Nakaya, Nakamura, Koufaty, and \nVishkin ).  The PTAB granted review  and informed the parties that claim construction \nwould be an open issue for trial.  See Intel Corp. v. XMTT , Inc. , No. IPR2020- 00145, \n2020 WL 2562752 (P.T.A.B. May 20, 2020) .  During the int er partes review oral hearing, \nthe Board proposed its own constructions for several terms .  The Board consequently  \ninvited both parties to submit supplemental briefing on its proposals.  \nIn its final decision, t he Board concluded that Intel had failed to show that  any of  \nthe claims of the  '388 patent were unpatentable.  See Intel Corp. v. XMTT, Inc. , No. \nIPR2020- 00145, 2021 WL 1895938 (P.T.A.B. May 11, 2021) .  But before reaching this \nultimate conclusion, the Board also construed various claim terms consistent with its \nproposals at the oral hearing.   See id.  at *3\u20136.  For example, the Board determined that \n\"'adapted to'  means 'configured to, ' 'primarily ' means 'largely but not wholly, ' and the \nserial and parallel processing modes each refer to the execution of the system as a \nwhole. \"  Id. at *5.  \n Intel appealed, arguing that the Board 's constructions were incorrect and that the Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 2 of 15 PageID #: 91273 \n Board had violated its due process rights  in changing claim construction theories  after \nthe original briefing.  The Federal Circuit  affirmed the Board' s decision in a short \nopinion, which is reproduced  here in its entirety : \nIntel Corporation appeals from an inter partes  review final written decision.   \nSee Intel Corp. v. XMTT, Inc. , No. IPR2020- 00145, 2021 WL 1895938 \n(P.T.A.B. May 11, 2021) ( Board Decision).  In that decision, the Patent \nTrial and Appeal Board held that no claim of U.S. Patent No. 7,707,388 \nwould have been obvious over Nakaya in combination with other references.  For the following reasons, we affirm.  \n Intel is judicially estopped from raising its claim construction argument.  The Board adopted the claim construction for which Intel advocated.   \nBoard Decision, 2021 WL 1895938, at *4\u2013 5.  Yet, Intel now changes its \nposition and advocates for a claim construction that is clearly inconsistent with its position before the Board.  Compare  Appellant 's Br. 36 \u201337, with \nJ.A. 685 \u201386.  Intel is judicially estopped from raising this argument.  We \nneed not consider Intel 's argument that Nakaya discloses the disputed \nclaim limitations under its new construction.  \n Further, the Board did not violate Intel 's due process rights.  Even if Intel \nwas entitled to an opportunity to respond to the Board' s claim construction, \nthe Boar d provided one.  It allowed supplemental briefing for the express \npurpose of addressing its proposed claim construction.  J.A. 591 \u201395.  \nThus, there was no due process violation.  \n Intel Corp. v. XMTT, Inc., No. 2021- 2127, 2022 WL 1152312, at *1 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 19, \n2022)  (footnote omitted) .  Having affirmed on the basis of judicial estoppel, the Federal \nCircuit did not address the Board' s claim construction rulings on the merits.  \n During the pendency of the Federal Circuit appeal , the parties filed a joint \nsupplemental claim construction brief  before this Court.   In this brief, XMTT asked the \nCourt to \"proceed under the plain language of the claims ,\" and Intel asked the Court to \n\"reject[] the PTAB 's constructions. \"  Joint Suppl. Claim Constr. Br. at 1 \u20132 (dkt. no. 224).  \nIntel's proposed constructions, however, repeated the claim language verbatim.  See id.  \nat 4\u20137 (listing proposed constructions).  XMTT advanced alternative construction Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 3 of 15 PageID #: 91284 \n language in the event that the Court agreed that construction was necessary, but its \nprimary position was that the plain language sufficed.  Given the lack of a real dispute, \nXMTT contended that Intel simply wanted an advisory opinion on the correctness of the PTAB' s decision, which Intel could then leverage before the Federal Circuit on appeal.  \nSee i d. at 7\u20138.  The Court did not rule at that point, however, and o nce the Federal \nCircuit issued its decision, the parties ' briefing was effectively moot . \n Now, in light of the Federal Circuit 's decision, Intel asks the Court to adopt the \nBoard' s constructions.  XMTT opposes construction of the terms in question and \ncontends that the terms ' plain language is sufficient.  Intel 's proposed constructions  are \nas follows:  \n\u2022 \"Serial processor \" \u2013 \"a processor adapted to execute so that  the system \nexecutes largely but not wholly in serial on the serial processor \" \n\u2022 \"Parallel processor \" \u2013 \"processors adapted to execute so that  the system \nexecutes  largely but not wholly in parallel on the parallel  processors \" \n\u2022 \"Serial processing mode\"  \u2013 \"a mo de where the system executes largely but not \nwholly  in serial on the serial processor \" \n\u2022 \"Parallel processing mode \" \u2013 \"a mode where the system executes largely but not \nwholly in parallel on the parallel processors \" \n\u2022 \"Primarily \" \u2013 \"largely but not wholly \" \n\u2022 \"Adapted to\"  \u2013 \"configured to\"  \nSee Proposed Claim Constr. Order (dkt. no. 262)  (specifying  patent and claim numbers \nfor each term) . \n  Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 4 of 15 PageID #: 91295 \n Discussion  \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the \ninvention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude. \"  Phillips v. AWH Corp. , \n415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"'[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for conducting claim construction. \"  Id. at \n1324.  Nor is \"the sequence of steps used by the judge in consulting various sources . . \n. important; what matters is for the court to attach the appropriate weight to be assigned \nto those sources in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law. \"  Id.  \"A claim \nconstruction is persuasive, not because it follows a certain rule, but because it defines terms in the context of the whole patent. \"  Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa'  per \nAzioni , 158 F.3d 1243, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  \nWhen construing patent claims, a court considers the intrinsic evidence, which \nincludes the literal language of the claim, the patent specification, and the prosecution \nhistory.  See Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc. , 52 F.3d 967, 977 \u201380 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  \" [T]he words of a claim are generally given \ntheir ordinary and customary meaning, \" which is \" the meaning that the term would have \nto a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing dat e of the patent application. \"  Phillips , 415 F.3d  at 1312 \u201313 \n(cleaned  up).  \"In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood \nby a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of  commonly understood words. \"  Id. at 1314.  \nIntel makes three arguments in support of construction: 1) the intrinsic evidence, Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 91306 \n particularly the prosecution history, supports construction; 2) the terms must be \nconstrued consistently for both validity and inf ringement; and 3) collateral estoppel \nshould apply to the PTAB' s construction of the terms in question.  The Court will \naddress each argument in turn.  \nA. Intrinsic  evidence  \n Intel argues first that the intrinsic evidence supports its proposed claim \nconstruction.  Intel attaches special import to the prosecution history as the key intrinsic \nevidence, which it refers to as the \"most significant source of the  legally operative \nmeaning of disputed claim language .\"  Def. Intel Corp.' s Opening Suppl. Br. at 9 (dkt. \nno. 260) (quoting Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576, 1581 (Fed. Cir. \n1996) ).  The Board' s construction, Intel contends, is part of the prosecution history.  As \nsuch, Intel argues, \" a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the Board' s \nclaim constructions to define the claims .\"  Id.  Additionally, Intel argues that the principle \nof stare decisis counsel s in favor of treating a patent uniformly  throughout litigation \nconcer ning the patent . \nIn contrast, XMTT contends that Intel  has not paid sufficient attention to the \nclaims ' plain language.  According to XMTT, the terms are \" self-explanatory, \" which , it \nsays, is why the parties did not propose them for construction during the original claim \nconstruction process  before the previously  assigned judge in this case .  XMTT 's Resp. \nSuppl. Br. at 7 \u20138 (dkt. no. 265).  XMTT also argues that the prosecution history is not \nbinding in this situation as a tool of clai m construction, and to the extent that the \nprosecution history is relevant, XMTT originally argued to the Board that the plain \nlanguage of the terms sufficed . Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 6 of 15 PageID #: 91317 \n Claim construction \" must begin and remain centered on the claim language \nitself. \"  Source Vagabond Sys. Ltd. v. Hydrapak, Inc. , 753 F.3d 1291, 1299 (Fed. Cir. \n2014) (quoting Innova/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Sys., Inc. , 381 F.3d \n1111, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).   XMTT  accordingly centers  its analysis on why there is no \nneed to redefine the pertinent language in the claims .  See XMTT 's Resp. Suppl. Br. at \n7\u20138 (dkt. no. 265) .  For example, XMTT notes  that one of the claim s already states that \na \"serial processor \" is a \"processor adapted to execute  software instructions in a \nsoftware program primarily in serial .\"  Id. at 7 (quoting U.S. Patent No. 7,707,388 col. 13 \nl. 52 (filed Apr. 27, 2010).  In a similar vein, XMTT points out that the prior construction \norder in this case already construes  the phrase \"prior to a transition from  a serial \nprocessing mode to a parallel processing mode\"  to mean \" before the point in time when \nthe [] parallel processors take over processing the software instructions in the software \nprogram  from the serial processor and execute instructions in the software program in \nparallel .\"  Id. (alteration in original).  Additionally, XMTT  further contends that the terms \n\"primarily \" and \"adapted to \" do not need explanation, which is demonstrated in part by \nthe fact that the Board described \" adapted to\"  and \"configured to\"  as interchangeable \nterms.  Id. at 8. \nIntel, on the other hand, offers no comparable discussion of  why it contends the \nplain language is insufficient.   When the claim language is \" readily apparent \" to a \nperson of skill in the art, construction \" involves little more than the application of the \nwidely accepted meaning of commonly understood words. \"  Phillips , 415 F.3d at  1314.  \nIntel's lack of discussion of the point tends to suggest that construction is unnecessary.  \nIn contrast to XMTT 's emphasis  on the plain language, Intel  singularly focuses on Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 91328 \n the prosecution history as the dispositive intrinsic evidence.  But not all intrinsic \nevidence is created equal.  The prosecution history is significant only to the extent that \n\"any explanation, elaboration, or qualification presented by the inventor during pat ent \nexamination . . . capture[s]  the scope of the actual invention that is disclosed, described, \nand patented. \"  AstraZeneca AB v. Mylan Pharms. Inc. , 19 F.4th 1325, 1335 (Fed. Cir. \n2021)  (cleaned up) ; see also  id. at 1336 (explaining that \" even in the absence of a clear \nand unmistakable disavowal ,\" relevant evidence can also include canceled claims).   \nHeeding AstraZeneca, Intel contends that the Court should rely on the prosecution \nhistory, which includes the Board' s constructions , because XMTT previously supported \nthe Board' s interpretation during the inter partes review.   \nA close examination of the record reveals , however,  that XMTT did not support \nthe Board' s eventual interpretation and instead has always contended that construction \nof the pertinent terms is not necessary.  In the very first paragraph of XMTT 's brief \nresponding to the Board' s order for briefing on its own proposed interpretation of the \nclaims , XMTT emph asized that \"the specification does not support an interpretation of \nthe claims where individual processors switch between serial and parallel configurations \n. . . so no further interpretation is necessary. \"  Pat. Owner 's Br.,  Ex A at 2 (dkt. no. 261-\n1) (emphasis in original).  Despite XMTT 's position , the Board adopted the claim \nconstruction for which Intel advocated.   See Intel Corp. v. XMTT, Inc. , No. IPR2020-\n00145, 2021 WL 1895938, at *4 \u20135 (P.T.A.B. May 11, 2021) .  On appeal  to the Federal \nCircuit, XMTT primarily argued that judicial estoppel barred Intel from challenging the \nBoard' s constructions \u2014an argument that carried the day.  See Intel Corp. , 2022 WL \n1152312 at *1.  In other words, XMTT did not advocate a particular construction; rather Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 8 of 15 PageID #: 91339 \n it contended that Intel was precluded from changing positions on appeal.  \nIntel's reference to the earlier claim construction briefing in the present case \nbefore the previously assigned judge does not change the calculus either.  In that brief, \nXMTT maintained\u2014as it does now \u2014that \"the Court should proceed under the plain \nlanguage of the claims . . . and that no further construction is necessary. \"  Joint Suppl. \nClaim Constr. Br. at 1 (dkt. no. 224).  XMTT only presented alternative constr uctions for \nconsideration in the event the Court rejected its position and determined that it was \nnecessary to construe the pertinent claim terms.   \nAll of this evidence reflects that XMTT has consistently argued that the terms \nneed not be construed.   The Court concludes that the prosecution history does not \nprovide any \" explanation, elaboration, or qualification\"  that better \" capture[s] the scope \nof the actual invention \" than the claim  language itself.   AstraZeneca, 19 F.4th at  1335.   \nThe Court therefore agrees with XMTT that the plain  language should control here, as it \nis the intrinsic evidence that is most directly on point.   Finally, Intel's invocation of stare \ndecisis  lacks merit.  As a preliminary matter, it is not clear that this argument is \nmaterially any different from Intel's collateral estoppel argument given that the parties in \nthe two proceedings are the same.  See generally  Ottah v. Fiat Chrysler , 884 F.3d \n1135, 1140 (Fed. Cir. 2018)  (discussing the similarity between stare decisis  principles \nand issue preclusion in the context of claim construction).  That aside, XMTT \nappropriately analogizes this case to In re Koninklijke Philips  Patent Lit igation , No. 18-\nCV-01885- HSG , 2020  WL 2733931 (N.D. Cal. May 26, 2020) , in which the court \nconcluded that it was \"not bound \" by the PTAB 's claim construction when the Federal \nCircuit \"expressly declined to address the parties ' claim construction dispute\"  on appeal.  Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 913410 \n Id. at *1.  Here too, the Federal Circuit did not address the claim construction dispute on \nthe merits, which means that court 's decision does not bind this Court on this issue.  \nSee Intel Corp. v. XMTT, Inc. , No. 2 021-2127, 2022 WL 1152312, at *1  (Fed. Cir. Apr. \n19, 2022) . \nIn sum, the Court overrules Intel's argument that the intrinsic evidence supports \nIntel's proposed claim construction.  \nB. Interpretation consistency  \nIntel argues  next that the Court should adopt t he Board' s constructions to avoid \ninconsistent constructions as between validity and infringement.  Consistency, \naccording to Intel, \"requires  that the Board' s constructions also govern the assessment \nof infringement in this Court. \"  Def. Intel Corp. 's Opening Suppl. Br. at 11 (dkt. no. 260).  \nTo support this contention, Intel cites two Federal Circuit cases.  See CommScope \nTechs. LLC v. Dali Wireless Inc. , 10 F.4th 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2021) ; 01 Communique  Lab'y, \nInc. v. Citrix Sys., Inc., 889 F.3d 735, 743 (Fed. Cir. 2018) .  The Court will briefly \ndiscuss each.  \nIn CommScope , two technology companies \u2014CommScope and Dali \u2014sued each \nother for infringement of their telecommunication patents.   See CommScope,  10 F.4th \nat 1291 \u201395.  A  jury rendered a verdict of infringement , validity , and damages for both \nCommScope and Dali , and the district court denied both parties ' post-trial motions.  On \nappeal, the Federal Circuit primarily addressed the jury's finding that CommScope \ninfringed Dali 's patent .  After first adopting  the district court 's claim construction of Dali' s \npatent, the court determined that subst antial evidence did not support the jury 's finding \nof infringement.  The court supported this conclusion,  in part , by agreeing  with Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 913511 \n CommScope that Dali' s infring ement  and invalidity  contentions on appeal led to an \n\"incongruity \": Dali could not \" simultaneously argue \" that CommScope 's device \"infringes \nby using a switch that is effectively nonoperating for a single power amplifier when \nfeeding back the signal for the other power amplifier, \" and that Dali's patent was valid \nsince \"it has a switch that operates identically to select feedback from multiple power \namplifiers. \"  Id. at 1299.  The court said that the \"case [fell] squarely within the principle \nthat a 'patent may not, like a nose of wax, be twisted one way to avoid anticipation and \nanother to find infringement. '\"  Id. (quoting Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, \nInc., 239 F.3d 1343, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ).  It therefore reversed the district court 's \ndenial of CommScope' s JMOL motion on the issue of no infringement.    \nThe 01 Communique case similarly concerned  a dispute between two technology \ncompanies , in which Communique sued Citrix for infringement of its remote computer \nconnection service patent.  See 01 Communique, 889 F.3d at 737 \u201339.  A jury returned \na split verdict \u2014Citrix had not established that the claims at issue in the patent were \ninvalid , and Communique had not established infringement \u2014and the district court \ndenied Communique' s motion for a new trial .  On appeal, the Federal Circuit reviewed \nthe invalidity defense as it had been presented below: Citrix had argued that \" under the \ntrial court 's claim construction [the claims at issue]  were valid, but not infringed, [and] if \nCommunique attempted to expand the scope of its claims . . . then the claims would be \ninvalid in light of the prior art .\"  Id. at 741\u2013 42 (internal citations omitted).   The Federal \nCircuit confirmed that \"[t]here was nothing improper about this argument \"; in fact , the \nargument \"correctly recognized that claim terms must be ' construed the same way for \nboth invalidity and infringement. '\"  Id. at 743 (quoting Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 11 of 15 PageID #: 913612 \n Roussel, Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ).  This conclusion, in part, led to the \nFederal Circuit  affirming  the district court 's order.  \nBoth CommScope  and 01 Communique  discuss the importance of construing \nclaims consistently for both validity and infringement \u2014a proposition that the Federal \nCircuit has repeatedly maintained.  See, e.g. , Source Search Techs., LLC v. \nLendingTree, LLC , 588 F.3d 1063, 1075 (Fed. Cir. 2009)  (collecting cases).  But neither \ncase arose in a posture like this one .  Perhaps more important ly, neither case provides \na mandate that \u2014as Intel argues here\u2014the PTAB 's unreviewed construction of a patent \nshould control a district court 's construction  of the patent .  And as XMTT points out, \ndistrict courts have also maintained that they are not required to adopt a PTAB \nconstruction .  See, e.g. , United Therapeutics Corp. v.  Liquidia Techs., Inc. , No. CV 20 -\n755, 2021 WL 5371461, at *3 (D. Del. Nov. 18, 2021) .   \nThe Court finds SkyHawke Technologies , LLC v. Deca International  Corp. , 828 \nF.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016) , instructive in resolving this tension, as its procedural \nposture is relatively similar to this case .  SkyHawke sued Deca for infringement of its \npatent , and the PTAB granted Deca' s request for  inter partes  review .  The Board \nconstrued various claims  and based on those constructions confirmed patentability .  \nEven though it had prevailed, SkyHawke appealed , asking the Federal Circuit to correct \nthe PTAB' s claim construction but affirm its ultimate decision.  SkyHawke did so \nbecause it was \"concerned that the district court [would]  rely on the Board' s claim \nconstruction and that Deca [would]  thereby escape the infringement suit. \"  Id. at 1376.  \nThe Federal Circuit acknowledged this concern but indicated that SkyHawke would not \nbe bound by the Board 's constructions : Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 12 of 15 PageID #: 913713 \n SkyHawke will have the opportunity to argue its preferred claim \nconstruction to the district court, and SkyHawke can appeal an unfavorable claim construction should that situation arise.  With the \npresent appeal, SkyHawke i s merely trying to preempt an unfavorable \noutcome that may or may not arise in the future and, if it does arise, is readily appealable at that time.  \n Id. at 1376\u2013 77.  As such, the Federal Circuit followed the prudential rule that a \nprevailing party cannot seek relief in an appellate court  and declined review .   \n For these reasons, the Court concludes t hat it is not required to adopt the PTAB' s \nconstruction of the relevant terms.  Additionally , to the extent that Intel  premises its \nargument for interpretation consistency on the contention that  XMTT has taken \ninconsistent positions, the Court disagrees for the reasons set forth above.  XMTT 's \nprimary argument has always been that construction is not necessary.   \nC. Collateral estoppel  \nIntel's final argument is that collateral estoppel , or issue preclusion , precludes \nXMTT from pursuing claim constructions different from used by the Board.  Issue \npreclusion requires : 1) the identical issue was actually litigated in a previous \nproceeding; 2)  the issue was adjudicated;  3) the previous determination was necessary \nto the decision;  and 4) the party being precluded from relitigating the issue was fully \nrepresented in the prior action.  See Jean Alexander Cosms., Inc. v. L' Oreal USA, Inc., \n458 F.3d 244, 249  (3d Cir. 2006) .   \n This argument lacks merit.  To the extent that the Federal Circuit decision could \nprovide the basis for issue preclusion, the Federal Circuit did not actually decide the \nissue of claim construction; its decision was singularly premised on judicial estoppel.  See Intel Corp. , 2022 WL 1152312 at *1.   To the extent that Intel premises its argument \non the PTAB decision, XMTT appropriately cites SkyHawke to support its contention Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 913814 \n that issue preclusion does not apply .  In SkyHawke , the Federal Circuit  rejected the \nproposition that a PTAB claim construction could provide the basis for issue preclusion \nin federal court and offered two reasons why: first, the failure to satisfy the \" actually \nlitigated \" element; and second, the lack of a right to appeal  by the litigant against whom \nissue preclusion would apply .  See SkyHawke , 828 F.3d at 1376.  \nThe first re ason offered in SkyHawke  is no longer applicable.  When SkyHawke  \nwas decided, the Board used a \" broadest reasonable interpretation \" standard that \ndiffered from the claim construction standard used by Article III courts, meaning the \nissue was not \"actually litigated \" under the more stringent standard.  See id.  at 1376.  \nBut in 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a rule that aligned the PTAB 's \nclaim construction standard with the standard used by Article III courts.  See 37 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 42.100(b) (201 8).  The PTAB decision in this case followed this standard.  See Intel \nCorp. , 2021 WL 1895938, at *3 n.1.  \nBut the second reason offered in SkyHawke \u2014the lack of a right to appeal \u2014\n\"counsel [s] against \" applying issue preclusion in this case.1  Doe v. Hesketh , 828 F.3d \n159, 174 (3d Cir. 2016) .  In short, \"[i]t is axiomatic that a judgment is without preclusive \neffect against a party which lacks a right to appeal that judgment .\"  Penda Corp. v. \nUnited States , 44 F.3d 967, 972\u2013 73 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ; see also  Kircher v. Putnam Funds \nTr., 547 U.S. 633, 647 (2006) ; SkyHawke Techs. , 828 F.3d at 1376.  The Third Circuit \nhas recognized this \" equitable exception\"  to issue preclusion, which applies \" where \n \n1 It is not entirely clear whether this exception to issue preclusion is mandatory or \ndiscretionary.  See, e.g.,  Biogen Int 'l GmbH v. Amneal Pharms. LLC , 487 F. Supp. 3d \n254, 266 n.12  (D. Del. 2020)  (discussing when issue preclusion is required) .  To the \nextent that the exception may be discretionary , the Court  concludes that it applies . Case 1:18-cv-01810-MFK   Document 293   Filed 07/22/22   Page 14 of 15 PageID #: 913915 \n \n'[t]he party  against whom preclusion is sought could not, as a matter of law, have \nobtained review of the judgment in the initial action. '\"  Hesketh , 828 F.3d at 174 (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28) (alteration in original).  Because XMTT \nprevailed before the PTAB, it had no right to appeal to the Federal Circuit.  This sort of \nprocedural history is precisely why this equitable exception to  issue preclusion exists.  \nSee Standefer v. United States , 447 U.S. 10, 23 n.18 (1980)  (explaining that issue \nprecl usion \"is premised upon an underlying confidence that the result achieved in the \ninitial litigation was substantially correct \" and that without appellate review \" such \nconfidence is often unwarranted \").  Put simply , the Court will not pre mise issue \npreclusion on the proposition that XMTT , as appellee,  could have asserted claim \nconstruction arguments, especially when its judicial estoppel argument was (at least as \nseen by the Federal Circuit) pretty close to a slam dunk .   \nThe Court reject s issue preclusion as a basis for Intel 's proposed constructions.  \nConclusion  \n For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the defendant 's request  for a \nsupplemental claim construction order [dkt. no. 262] .
