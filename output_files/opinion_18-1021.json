Civil Action No. 18-1021-RGA \nDEPARTMENT OF FINANCE , SUSSEX : \nCOUNTY , DELAWARE , et al., \nDefendants . \nSandra Harmon, Hartsville , South Carolina. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nKevin J. Connors and Artemio C. Aranilla, II, Marshall, Dennehey , Warner, Coleman & \nGoggin, Wilmington , Delaware . Counsel for Defendants . \nMarch ,3 , 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION A~~~ \nPlaintiff Sandra Harmon appears pro se. She commenced this lawsuit on July \n11, 2018. She alleges civil RICO, violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 & 242, and violations \nof her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection . (D.I. 1). Before the \nCourt is Defendants ' renewed motion to dismiss and Plaintiff's amended motion for \nsummary judgment. (D.I. 44, 58). The matters have been fully briefed. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn December 20, 2017, Plaintiff filed an action in this Court against Sussex \nCounty and other Sussex County officials. See Harmon v. Sussex Cty., Civ. No. 17-\n1817-RGA at 0.1. 1. The Court liberally construed the Complaint as raising \nconstitutional claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Id. at 0.1. 76. The Court takes \njudicial notice that on January 12, 2018, during the pendency of Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA , \nand prior to the time Plaintiff commenced this action, the Department of Finance of \nSussex County filed a monitions suit against Plaintiff and others for delinquent sewer \nand water bills and a demolition lien. Department of Finance of Sussex County v. \nHarmon Heirs, Civ. A. No. S18T-01-002 (Del. Super.) at BL-1.1 Monition was entered \non January 18, 2018, and posted on the property on January 23, 2018. Id. at BL-6. \nOn May 30, 2018, a notice of Sheriff's sale was posted at the physical entrance of the \nproperty and, on May 31, 2018, Plaintiff and the other property owners were notified by \ncertified mail of a Sheriff's sale of the real estate to take place on June 19, 2018, at 9:30 \na.m. Id. at BL-16, BL-17, BL-18. \n1 The Court has access to the Superior Court docket via Bloomberg Law. \"BL\" is how \nBloomberg Law refers to docket entries. \n1 On June 8, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss and motion for injunctive relief \nin Civ. A. No. S18T-01-002 alleging violations of her constitutional rights. Id. at BL-10. \nOn June 18, 2018, the Superior Court denied the motion and ordered that the sale could \nproceed as scheduled on June 19, 2018. Id. at BL-28. The property was sold on June \n19, 2018 to the highest bidder. Id. at BL-36. On June 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion \nto invalidate and to dismiss. Id. at BL-30. Plaintiff filed an objection to the sale, and \nthen an amended notice of objection . Id. at BL-35, BL-44. \nOn July 11, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this action alleging that Defendants are \nviolating her right to due process and equal protection by \"engaging in arbitrary conduct \nwith respect to the selling of [her] property at Sheriff['s] Sale on June 19, 2018.\" (D.I. 1 \nat 2). Plaintiff alleges the property was unlawfully sold and the conduct of Defendant \nAttorney Jason Adkins was racist. (Id. at 2-3). Plaintiff alleges that Adkins' conduct \nand \"those that support it\" run afoul of RICO. (Id. at 4). \nShe explains that the Sussex County Department of Finance alleged that she \nowed for a sewer and water bill that had been paid in full on June 15, 2018. (Id. at 3). \nDefendants also said Plaintiff owed costs from a September 14, 2017 demolition. (Id.) \nPlaintiff alleges that the Department added interest to the total cost of demolition and \nthen attempted to seek a judgment for the full cost of the demolition . (Id.). She \nalleges the sale took place without the filing of a complaint , service, or notice to her and \nthe other co-owners of the property. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges the \"S18T-01-002 case \nnumber is clearly bogus, and it's unlawful generation represents racketeering and \ncorruption at the hands of Sussex County Officials.\" (/d. at 4). \n2 Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Adkins \"to halt his misconduct , and find him in contempt \nand in violation of court rules of civil procedure ,\" to recover compensatory damages , \nand to obtain an order rescinding the Sheriff's sale, damages , and costs. (Id. at 5). \nShe also requests counsel.2 (Id.). \nOn August 9, 2018, during the pendency of this action, Plaintiff filed a motion to \ndismiss in Civ. A. No. S18T-01-002. Id. at BL-51. On November? , 2018, the Superior \nCourt stayed the matter while awaiting resolution of the two related federal civil cases \nPlaintiff had filed here, that is, Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA , and the instant case, Civ. No. 18-\n1021-RGA. Id. at BL-51. Plaintiff then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the \nDelaware Supreme Court to compel the Superior Court judge to dismiss S18T-01-002 . \nId. at BL-53, BL-56. The Delaware Supreme Court dismissed the petition. Id. at BL-\n57. An affidavit of non-redemption was filed on June 19, 2019, and an amended writ \nfiled July 11, 2019. Id. at BL-59, BL-60. \nOn August 20, 2019, this Court abstained from the instant action under the \nYounger abstention doctrine. (D.I. 23, 24). Plaintiff appealed , and the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the abstention order and remanded the \nmatter. See Harmon v. Department of Fin., 811 F. App'x 156 (3d Cir. 2020). \nOn September 12, 2019, this Court granted summary judgment in favor of \nDefendants and against Plaintiff in Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA. See Harmon v. Sussex \n2 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1 ), the court may request an attorney to represent \nany person unable to afford counsel. Section 1915(e)(1) confers the district court with \nthe power to request that counsel represent a litigant who is proceeding in forma \npauperis. Plaintiff has never sought in forma pauperis status, and she paid the filing \nfee. She does not qualify for counsel under\u00a7 1915. \n3 Cty., Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA at 0.1. 76, 77. The Court found that the record did not \nsupport a finding of a violation of Plaintiffs rights to equal protection and due process,3 \nthat there was a conspiracy to deprive African Americans of their property, or that \nDefendants interfered in the use of the property at issue. Id. at 0.1. 76 at 8-20. \nPlaintiff appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed \nthe judgment on April 8, 2020. Harmon v. Sussex Cty., 810 F. App'x 139 (3d Cir. \n2020). \nOn April 22, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion to lift stay and proceed with a hearing \non the notice of objection to Sheriffs sale in the Superior Court case. Civ. A. No. \nS18T-01-002 at BL-61. On June 12, 2020, the Superior Court entered an order that \ndenied the motion to lift the stay observing that there remained a pending federal case \nand, in both the state and federal actions, Plaintiff argues the monition procedures used \nwere wrong. Id. at BL-67. \nOn February 2, 2021, this Court revisited the issue of abstention in the instant \ncase and determined that the underlying state action did not fall into any of the \ncategories required for this Court to abstain; the Court therefore denied Defendants ' \nmotion to dismiss under the Younger abstention doctrine. (0.1. 42, 43). On February \n9, 2021, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal due to an administrative error that closed the \ncase. (0.1. 48, 51 ). \n3 At summary judgment , Plaintiff argued that Defendants unlawfully took her property \nand sold it at a Sheriffs Sale and that Defendants arbitrarily and capriciously applied \nrules, procedures , and policies, all in violation of her right to due process. Plaintiff did \nnot raise this claim in her complaint and it was not considered. See No. 17-1817, 0.1. \n76 at 13 n.10. \n4 On February 16, 2021, Defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss under the \nYounger abstention doctrine. (0.1. 44). Defendants also sought dismissal for failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted and for failure to join an indispensable \nparty. (0.1. 46). On March 11, 2021, the Court dismissed the renewed motion to \ndismiss (0.1. 44) without prejudice and leave to refile when the appeal was no longer \npending. (0.1. 54) The appeal was dismissed on June 9, 2021 for lack of appellate \njurisdiction. (0.1. 55). Following the appeal's dismissal , the parties treated the motion \nto dismiss (0.1. 44) as having been renewed. On June 16, 2021, Plaintiff filed a \nresponse to the motion to dismiss and, on the same day, she filed an amended motion \nfor summary judgment. (0.1. 56, 58). In turn, Defendants filed a reply brief in support \nof the motion to dismiss and an opposition to Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. \n(0.1. 60, 63). Plaintiff filed additional oppositions to the motion to dismiss and a reply \nbrief in support of her motion for summary judgment. (0.1. 62, 65, 66, 72). \nDefendants move to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) by reason of collateral estoppel \nand res judicata. (D.I. 44). They also move to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7) for \nfailure to join an indispensable party. Plaintiff moves for summary judgment. (0.1. 58). \nThe Court turns to the case dispositive issue of res judicata. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \nplaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds \nprose, her pleading is liberally construed and her complaint , \"however inartfully \npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by \n5 lawyers.\" Id. A court may consider the pleadings , public record, orders, exhibits \nattached to the complaint , and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference. \nTellabs, Inc. v. Makar Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). A Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion maybe granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as \ntrue and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \n\"Though 'detailed factual allegations' are not required, a complaint must do more \nthan simply provide 'labels and conclusions ' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of \na cause of action.\"' Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). I am \"not required to credit bald assertions or \nlegal conclusions improperly alleged in the complaint. \" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., \nInc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed , \nhowever, \"for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\" \nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014). \nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \"substantive \nplausibility.\" Id. at 347. That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"A claim has facial plausibility when the \n[complainant] pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the [accused] is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. Deciding \nwhether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. at 679. \nIn deciding motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), courts generally \nconsider only the allegations in the complaint , exhibits attached to the complaint , \n6 matters of public record, and documents that form the basis of a claim. A \ndocument forms the basis of a claim if the document is \"integral to or explicitly \nrelied upon in the complaint.\" The purpose of this rule is to avoid the situation \nwhere a plaintiff with a legally deficient claim that is based on a particular \ndocument can avoid dismissal of that claim by failing to attach the relied upon \ndocument. Further, considering such a document is not unfair to a plaintiff \nbecause, by relying on the document , the plaintiff is on notice that the document \nwill be considered . \nLum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nDefendants argue that res judicata (also called claim preclusion) precludes the \nclaims raised by Plaintiff. Res judicata \"prevents parties from raising issues that could \nhave been raised and decided in a prior action--even if they were not actually litigated.\" \nLucky Brand Dungarees , Inc. v. Marcel Fashions Grp., Inc., _U.S._, 140 S. Ct. 1589, \n1594 (2020); see also Beasley v. Howard, 14 F.4th 226, 231-32 (3d Cir. 2021) (res \njudicata bars not only claims that were brought in a previous action, but also claims that \ncould have been brought). \n\"If a later suit advances the same claim as an earlier suit between the same \nparties [or their privies], the earlier suit's judgment 'prevents litigation of all grounds for, \nor defenses to, recovery that were previously available to the parties, regardless of \nwhether they were asserted or determined in the prior proceeding. \"' Lucky Brand \nDungarees , Inc., 140 S. Ct. at 1594-95 (quoting Brown v. Fe/sen, 442 U.S. 127, 131 \n(1979)). A party seeking to invoke the res judicata doctrine must demonstrate that \nthere has been \"(1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same \nparties or their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the same cause of action.\" \nDuhaney v. Attorney Gen. of the U.S., 621 F.3d 340, 347 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing In re \nMullarkey , 536 F.3d 215, 225 (3d Cir. 2008)). When analyzing whether the elements \n7 have been met, the court does \"not apply this conceptual test mechanically , but focuses \non the central purpose of the doctrine, to require a plaintiff to present all claims arising \nout of the same occurrence in a single suit.\" Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 767 F.3d \n247, 277 (3d Cir. 2014). This avoids piecemeal litigation and conserves judicial \nresources. Id. \nThe Court takes \"a broad view of what constitutes the same cause of action and \nthat res judicata generally is thought to turn on the essential similarity of the underlying \nevents giving rise to the various legal claims.\" Id. (cleaned up). When analyzing \n\"essential similarity ,\" several factors are considered : \"(1) whether the acts complained of \nand the demand for relief are the same; (2) whether the theory of recovery is the same; \n(3) whether the witnesses and documents necessary at trial are the same; and \n(4) whether the material facts alleged are the same.\" See id. (cleaned up). \nDefendants argues that in the two cases Plaintiff filed in this Court -Civ. No. 17-\n1817-RGA and Civ. No. 18-1021-RGA , Plaintiff named Sussex County, Delaware , as a \ndefendant. Plaintiff named \"Sussex County State of Delaware Administration \" in Civ. \nNo. 17-1817, and she named \"Department of Finance, Sussex County, De.\" in Civ. No. \n18-1021. In Defendants ' view they are \"functionally the same party\" since \"the Office of \nFinance is a subdivision of the County Department of Administration ,\" citing 9 Del. C \u00a7 \n1371, and because both are subdivisions of Sussex County; \"they are not separate \nentities for purposes of suit.\" (D.I. 46 at 15-16, citing Breitigan v. State of Delaware , \n2003 WL 21663676 , at *2 (D. Del. July 16, 2003)). \nDefendants contend that all the elements of res judicata are met. There was a \nfinal judgment on the merits in Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA , Plaintiff sued the same \n8 government party, and this cause of action is the same as that asserted in Civ. No. 17-\n1817-RGA. (/d. at 16). Defendants argue that in each case, Plaintiff argued that the \nactions taken against her in connection with the demolition of her home violated the law \nand violated her constitutional rights and, thus, the claims are barred by res judicata. \n(Id.). \nPlaintiff responds that when she filed the first action, Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA, she \nhad no knowledge that a monition existed and found out about it while litigating the \ncase. (D.I. 56 at 2, 21). She explains she \"realized that [she] had to file another claim \nin federal court, as a result of the unlawful action that culminated into a monition, that \nwas not mentioned nor included\" in Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA. (Id. at 2). Plaintiff's \nopposition contains bald statements of foul play, fraud, misconduct, and criminal \nactions. (Id. at 2-4). She argues the monition action was improper , and the lien on the \nproperty at issue was improperly filed. (/d.). \nPlaintiff's claims are barred by res judicata. There was a final judgment on the \nmerits in Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA. That case involves the same parties or their privies \nas those in the instant case. In addition, there is essential similarity of the underlying \nevents that give rise the Plaintiff's claims. In both actions Plaintiff complains of the \nunlawful taking of property and seeks the return of her property as Well as \ncompensatory damages in addition to numerous other requests for relief. In both \nactions Plaintiff alleges violations of her right to due process and equal protection and \nthe wrongful taking of property based upon her race. The witnesses and documents \nnecessary at trial are essentially same, as they all concern the acts that resulted in the \ndemolition of the property at issue and a Sheriff's sale of the property. Finally, the \n9 material facts alleged are the same, again all concerning monies owed to Sussex \nCounty, a lien on the property, and taking of the property. \nPlaintiff argues that she was unaware of the monition action when she \ncommenced Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA. That's true, but that's not the point. The Court \ntakes judicial notice that on May 31, 2018, Plaintiff was notified by certified mail that a \nSheriffs Sale would take place on June 19, 2018 at 9:30 a.m.; that on June 21, 2018, \nPlaintiff filed a motion to invalidate and dismiss; and on July 7, 2018 a letter from the \npresiding Superior Court Judge was docketed that dismissed Plaintiffs motions as \nmoot. She attached to the complaint in this case \"Docket Report Results\" for Case ID \nS18T-01-002 , which is described as being filed on January 12, 2018, and, in fairly large \ncapital letters as its \"type\" being \"MONITIONS JUDGMENT. \" (D.I. 1 at 10 of 14). It is \nclear from Plaintiffs filings in the Superior Court and in this case that early on and \nbefore she commenced the instant action on July 11, 2018, Plaintiff had knowledge of \nthe monitions action. The claims in this case could easily have been included in Civ. No. \n17-1817-RGA. Yet the docket for Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA does not indicate that at any \ntime Plaintiff sought to amend the complaint. The judgment in Civ. No. 17-1817-RGA \nprevents litigation of the instant case. \nAccordingly , the Court will grant Defendants ' motion to dismiss on the grounds of \nres judicata.4 \n4 The Court will not address the other grounds for dismissal since dismissal is \nappropriate by reason of res judicata. Nor does the Court address the merits of \nPlaintiffs amended motion for summary judgment as it is moot. \n10 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants ' renewed motion to \ndismiss; and (2) dismiss as moot Plaintiffs amended motion for summary judgment. \nA separate order shall issue. \n11 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSANDRA HARMON , \nPlaintiff, \nV. Civil Action No. 18-1021-RGA \nDEPARTMENT OF FINANCE , SUSSEX: \nCOUNTY, DELAWARE, et al., \nDefendants. \nc) ORDER \n3~ \nAt Wilmington this day of March, 2022, consistent with the memorandum \nopinion issued this date, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Defendants ' renewed motion to dismiss (D.I. 44) is GRANTED . \n2. Plaintiff's amended motion for summary judgment (D.I. 58) is DISMISSED \nas moot. \n3. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case. "}
