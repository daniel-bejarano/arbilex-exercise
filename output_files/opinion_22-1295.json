(\u201cZwift \u201d) to respond to Amended Interrogatory No. 1 and produce documents responsive to \nAmended Request for Production No. 3 in connection with Wahoo\u2019s pending motion for a \npreliminary injunction  (D.I. 71; D.I. 72) , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that  Wahoo \u2019s motion to \ncompel  supplementation of the responses is DENIED  without prejudice, and Wahoo\u2019s motion to \ncompel Zwift to remove redactions from previously-produced documents is GRANTED, for the \nreasons  set forth below. \n1. Background.   Wahoo filed this patent infringement action on October 3, 2022,\nalleging that Zwift\u2019s \u201cHub\u201d bicycle trainer product infringes three of Wahoo\u2019s patents  directed to \na bicycle trainer with a frame, flywheel, and magnetic brake assembly  that is operable for use \nwith a conventi onal bicycle with its rear wheel removed .  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 50-53, 57-60, 64-67)  \nAccording to Wahoo, Zwift\u2019s alleged infringement impacts sales of Wahoo\u2019s KICKR and \nKICKR CORE products which practice the claimed inventions in the patents- in-suit.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n39, 43, 47)  2. On November 16, 2022, Wahoo filed a motion for a preliminary inj unction \nseeking to enjoin Zwift\u2019s sales of its Hub product.  (D.I. 10)   The parties subsequently entered \ninto a stipulated  schedule for the expedited exchange of preliminary injunction- related discovery , \nand the court set a preliminary injunction hearing date of April 11, 2023.  (D.I. 32)   A stipulated \nprotective order is in place.  (D.I. 34)  \n3. Legal standard .  Under Rule 26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \n\u201c[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s \nclaim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case [.]\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  These \ngeneral parameters apply to pre -hearing discovery, \u201calthough the scope of discovery may be \nlimited to focus on claims and defenses that will be relevant in the context of the upcoming \npreliminary injunction hearing.\u201d  Danieli Corp. v. SMS Grp., Inc., 2022 WL 2541981, at *1 \n(W.D. P a. Mar. 18, 2022).  The party moving to compel discovery bears the burden to show the \nrelevance of the requested information.   See Am. Bottling Co. Inc. v. Vital Pharms., Inc., C.A. \nNo. 20- 1268- TMH, 2021 WL 9599683, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 27, 2021).  Once relevance is shown, \nthe non- moving party may show why the discovery should not be permitted despite its relevance.  \nSee Tessera, Inc. v. Broadcom Corp., C.A. No. 16- 380-LPS-CJB, 2017 WL 4876215, at *2 (D. \nDel. Oct. 24, 2017).  \n4. Analysis .  Wahoo  moves to compel  Zwift  to supplement its responses to \nAmended Request for Production No. 3 and Amended Interrogatory No. 1 to produce discovery \non Zwift\u2019s unlaunched, abandoned, and future products.  (D.I. 71, Ex. 3 at 6; Ex. 4 at 9)   Wahoo \nargues that this discovery is relevant because Zwift has represented that the Hub is its only \nhardware product  on the market, and an injunction would damage Zwift\u2019s reputation and impair \nits ability to reenter the market.  ( Id. at 2)  Wahoo maintains  it should be permitted to take discovery on the reasons why the Hub is Zwift\u2019s only product on the market  and how soon Zwift \ncould launch and sell other hardware products in the future  because this discovery is relevant to \nconsiderations including irrepar able harm and the balance of hardships .  (Id.)   \n5. Wahoo\u2019s motion to compel supplemental responses to Amended Request for \nProduction No. 3 and Amended Interrogatory No. 1 is DENIED  without prejudice .  The record \nbefore the court shows that Zwift provided testimony from a 30(b)(6) designee on its \nunlaunched, abandoned, and future products .  (D.I. 72, Ex. A at 38:16- 51:23, 65:20- 66:20)  \nWahoo acknowledges that \u201cZwift was willing to allow Wahoo to question Zwift\u2019s 30(b)(6) \nwitness\u201d regarding this subject matter, without acknowledging that the deposition took place.  \n(D.I. 71 at 1)  Wahoo does not identify any deficiencies in the proffered testimony or explain \nwhy a further document production is needed following the 30(b)(6) testimony. \n6. Zwift has shown that the document discovery requested by Wahoo is not \nproportional to the needs of the case at this stage of the proceedings.  (D.I. 72)  The complaint \nestablishes that Wahoo was aware of Zwift\u2019s unlaunched and abandoned hardware products , yet \nit did not raise these products in its motion for a preliminary injunction , indicating that the \nrelevance of the requested discovery to the preliminary injunction inquiry is limited .  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 \n24; D.I. 12 )  The testimony of Zwift\u2019s 30(b)(6) designee confirms that a complete document \nproduction on Zwift\u2019s two unlaunched or abandoned bicycle trainers  would be extensive and \nburdensome because the projects involved many  employees  in various capacities  over a \nsignificant length of time .  (D.I. 72, Ex. A at  76:12- 77:2; see also Ex. B; Ex. D )  And the court \ncannot discern any deficiencies or gaps in the testimony provided by Zwift\u2019s 30(b)(6) designee \non the subjects of unlaunched, abandoned, and future products.  ( Id., Ex. A)   On this record, the \ncourt finds that expanding the scope of discovery on Zwift\u2019s unlaunched, abandoned, and future products to include a document production in addition to the existing 30(b)(6) testimony would \nnot be  proportional i n the context of the upcoming preliminary injunction hearing.  \n7. Wahoo also moves to compel Zwift to remove redactions  included in its \ndocument production served on February 17, 2023, to the extent that those redactions relate to \nZwift\u2019s unlaunched, abandoned, and future products .  (D.I. 71 at 1)  According to Wahoo, these \nredactions were not identified as privilege -related redactions, and Zwift confirmed that it \nredacted information on \u201cnon- accused products\u201d on relevance grounds.  ( Id.; Ex. 2 at 1)  Zwift \ndoes not separately address the documents which were already produced but contain redactions \nof information relating to its unlaunched, abandoned, and future products in its responsive letter \nbrief.  (D.I. 72)  \n8. Wahoo\u2019s motion to compel Zwift to remove redactions relating to its unlaunched, \nabandoned, or future products from previously produced, nonprivileged documents is \nGRANTED.   Zwift\u2019s arguments on burden and proportionality do not logically extend to \ndocuments which it already produc ed, and Zwift\u2019s 30(b)(6) testimony on this subject matter has \nnegated the reasons for redacting the material in the first instance.  Consequently, Zwift shall \nproduce the unredacted documents on or before March 3, 2023, to allow sufficient time for \nWahoo t o consider the documents before the March 7 deadline for its reply brief on the \npreliminary injunction motion.  (D.I. 32)  \n9. Conclusion.   For the foregoing reasons , Wahoo \u2019s motion to compel the \nsupplementation of Zwift\u2019s responses to Amended Request for Production No. 1 and Amended \nInterrogatory No. 1 is DENIED  without prejudice , and Wahoo\u2019s motion to compel Zwift to \nremove any redactions to previously produced, nonprivileged documents relating to Zwift\u2019s \nunlaunched, abandoned, or future products is GRANTED.  (D.I. 71)  Zwift shall produce the unredacted documents on or before March 3, 2023.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the \ndiscovery dispute teleconference set in this matter fo r March 1 , 2023 at 2:00 p.m. is \nCANCELLED.  \n10. Given that the court has relied upon material that technically remains under seal, \nthe court is releasing this Memorandum Order under seal, pending review by the parties.  In the \nunlikely event that the parties be lieve that certain material in this Memorandum O rder should be \nredacted, the parties shall jointly submit a proposed redacted version by no later than March 6 , \n2023, for review by the court, along with a motion supported by a declaration that includes a \nclear, factually detailed explanation as to why disclosure of any proposed redacted material \nwould \u201cwork a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure.\u201d  See In re \nAvandia Mktg., Sales Practices & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting \nMiller v. Ind. Hosp., 16 F.3d 549, 551 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  If the \nparties do not file a proposed redacted ver sion and corresponding motion, or if the court \ndetermines the motion lacks a meritorious basis, the documents will be unsealed within seven (7)  \ndays of the date the Memorandum Order issued.  \n11. This Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2).
