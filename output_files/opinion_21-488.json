INTRODUCTION Chapter 11 \nCase No. 20-10166-JTD \n(Jointly Administered) \nCiv. No. 21-488-LPS \nThis appeal arises in the Chapter 11 cases of debtor Lucky's Market Parent Company and \ncertain of its affiliates (\"Debtors\"). On April 24, 2020, appellant ATM Forum Louisville KY, \nLLC (\"Landlord\") filed an application seeking allowance of an administrative expense claim \nbased on its non-residential real property lease with the Debtors. Landlord asserted that the \nDebtors: (i) violated Bankruptcy Court orders regarding removal of property from the leased \npremises, (ii) wrongfully converted Landlord 's property, (iii) negligently caused damage to \nLandlord 's property, and (iv) breached the terms of the lease prior to rejection. Following \nevidentiary hearings on November 3, 2020 (AP783-1060) (\"11/3/20 Tr.\") and January 8, 2021 \n(AP1061-1329) (\"1/8/21 Tr.\"), the Bankruptcy Court issued its opinion (D.I. 1-1)1 and order \n1 The appendix (D .I. 15) to Landlord 's opening brief (D .I. 14) is cited herein ( consistent with its \npagination but not its index) as \"AP_.\" The docket of the Debtors' Chapter 11 cases is cited \nherein as \"B.D.I. \" \n1 (D.I. 1-2), In re Lucky's Market Parent Co., 2021 WL 1100066 (Ban1a. D. Del. Mar. 17, 2021) \n(\"Decision\"), denying Landlord's application . Landlord has appealed the Decision. \nII. BACKGROUND \nA. Parties and Lease \nDebtors operated 39 full-service organic grocery stores in the United States. Debtors \nleased 37 of the stores and owned the other two. Landlord is a subsidiary of Arciterra \nCompanies, a private real estate company that owns 70-100 shopping centers and other retail \nproperties throughout the country. Relevant to this dispute, Landlord owns certain retail space \nlocated at 100-300 Hurstbourne Parkway in Louisville , Kentucky (\"Store\" or \"Premises\"). In \n2013, Debtors negotiated with Landlord to lease the Premises . (AP578-AP590 (\"Larmore \nDeel.\") ,r 12) On or about July 30, 2013, Landlord and Debtors executed a lease. (AP1390-\nAP1445) (\"Lease\") \nThe parties do not dispute the following findings by the Ban1auptcy Court. The Premises \nhad to be significantly modified in order to convert the existing retail space into one that could \naccommodate a grocery store. See Lucky's Store, 2021 WL 1100066, at * 5. At the time the \nLease was executed, the Premises did not have any refrigeration components or capabilities, \nincluding any in-slab refrigeration pipes, in-wall refrigeration pipes, or rooms for refrigeration. \nSee id. In addition, there were no exhaust hoods, sinks/handwashing stations, or other items that \nare necessary to operate a grocery store. See id. The Lease required Landlord to construct or \npay for \"Landlord's Work\" to alter and improve the Premises, including: (1) new electrical \nmeter/distribution panel; (2) water meter/gas line sufficient to meet tenant's use requirements; \n(3) sewer lines to meet tenant's code requirement; (4) loading dock to accommodate a 75-foot \nsemi-truck (with 53 foot trailer with truck cab) with doc leveler seals and proper loading \n2 platform, the design to be agreed upon by the parties; (5) concrete slab repaired or replaced as \nneeded to provide a clean and level slab ready for floor covering; (6) split-level section of \nPremises to be removed; and (7) a new fa9ade and vestibule with new entry doors. See id. at *6. \nThe Lease also provided that the Debtor would perform \"Tenant's Work,\" defined as \"all \nleasehold improvements, fixtures, equipment , and merchandise required for Tenant to open the \nPremises for business to the public that is not included in the Landlord 's Work.\" Id. The Lease \nincluded a \"Tenant Improvement Allowance \" of $1,203,800, or $40 per square foot, that \nLandlord was to pay to Debtor in two payments -at the 50% completion mark and the 100% \ncompletion mark -conditioned upon receipt of reasonable evidence of completion, such as paid \ninvoices and applicable lien waivers of subcontracted work. Id. at *7. \nUnder the Lease, Debtors were obligated to maintain, repair, and replace all interior \ncomponents of the Premises. Debtors were obliged to promptly repair any damage caused by \nremoval of their personal property, with the exception of small holes caused by nails or fasteners. \nB. Store Closing Procedures Order and FF&E Bid \nOn January 27, 2020 (\"Petition Date\"), certain Debtors filed voluntary petitions \ncommencing a case for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On the Petition Date, \nDebtors filed their Motion for Approval of (I) Procedures for Store Closing Sales and (II) \nAssumption of the Liquidation Consulting Agreement (APl-50) , seeking approval of the store \nclosing procedures (\"Store Closing Procedures \") and assumption of a liquidation consulting \nagreement with Great American Global Partners, LLC (\"Great American \" or \"Liquidation \nConsultant\"). On January 28, 2020, the Bankruptc y Court entered an interim order approving \n3 the relief sought (AP51-85) (\"Store Closing Procedures Order\") and on March 3, 2020, it entered \na final order (B.D.I. 321). \nParagraph 4 of the Store Closing Procedures Order authorized the Debtors and the \nLiquidation Consultant \"to sell or transfer the movable furniture, fixtures, or other equipment , \nexcluding any and all property of the landlord including all real property improvements located \non the Premises (the 'FF&E' and, together with the applicable inventory , the 'Store Closing \nAssets') located at the Closing Stores, and any such transaction shall be free and clear of all \nliens, claims, interests, and other encumbrances. \" (AP66) \nDebtors retained Great American to assist with the sale of FF&E for the Store. Peter \nWyke oversaw Debtors' liquidation sales on behalf of Great American. (1/8/21 Tr. at 96:5-9; \n97:5-7) Great American contracted Dennis Jenkins as the lead liquidation consultant to help \noversee Debtors' FF&E liquidation sales. (1/8/21 Tr. at 96:5-9; 97:5-7) Great American \ncontracted Clarissa Mclean as the liquidation consultant to oversee the sale and removal of the \nFF&E at the Store (\"Louisville FF&E\"). \nChad Renier is CEO of Mechanical Removal & Relocation, LLC (\"Buyer\" or \"Mr. \nRenier\"). (AP525-43 (\"Renier Deel.\") ,r 9) Mr. Renier has 18 years of experience in the \ndisconnection , removal, purchase , and resale of FF&E from grocery stores. (1/8/21 Tr. at \n162:13-15; Renier Deel. ,r,r 4-14) Based on photographs and discussions with Ms. Mclean, \nBuyer determined that a fair bid for the Louisville FF&E was $20,000 and submitted a bulk bid \nfor the Louisville FF&E. Buyer's bid was the sole bulk bid. \nOn February 4, 2020, Buyer agreed to purchase the Louisville FF&E from Debtors for \nthe purchase price of $20,000, evidenced by Invoice #80015 (\"Louisville FF&E Invoice\"). \n4 (AP1498) The Louisville FF&E Invoice provided a non-exclusive list of equipment being sold \nto Buyer, including: \nAll removable FF &E to include but not limited to All FF &E \nlocated inside the facility, kitchen, bakery, shopping carts, deli \nequipment, refrigeration equipment, bailer, compactor, POS \nSystem, network equipment , server equipment, desktop computers, \ngondola shelving, butcher equipment, cafe equipment , walk in \ncoolers, refrigeration racks and compressors (Freon to be removed \nby Lucky's before dismantling) . \nThe Louisville FF &E Invoice also provided a non-exclusive list of FF &E that was excluded from \nthe sale to the Buyer, including : \n(Id.) All leasehold improvements including but not limited to: A/C \nunits, plumbing, lighting, flooring, fire suppressions/sprinkler \nsystems, fire alarms, burglar alarms, doors, walls, ceilings, roofs, \nwindows, electrical transformers , electrical boxes, bathroom \nfixtures, built in kitchen cabinets, built in work stations, lighting \ncontrollers, back up electrical generators , transfer switches and \nassociated controllers , forklift/order pickers (if identified as \nleased), handheld computers, tablet computers , laptop computers. \nC. Disputed FF &E \nAs of February 12, 2020, most of the FF&E had been staged by Mr. Renier's team for \nremoval, under Ms. Mclean' s supervision -but none of it had been removed. (Renier Deel. at \n140) On February 12, 2020, Jeremy Hamilton, Landlord's leasing representative, learned that \nBuyer was onsite and removing or preparing to remove property. (AP1527-1536 at 5-9; 11/3/20 \nTr. at 61:18-62:14) Mr. Hamilton contacted Ms. McLean by phone to ask what property was \nbeing removed, but Ms. McLean would not give him any information. (11/3/20 Tr. 63:13-64:7) \nAlso on February 12, 2020, Debtors' counsel left a voicemail for Landlord , stating that \"no \n5 fixtures were being removed\" and Debtors would cause the removal to cease for the day until \nLandlord 's representative could be present to identify disputed items. (AP1541-42 ) \nThe parties dispute the events that followed. Sometime between February 12 and 13, \n2020, Mr. Hamilton spoke with Ms. McLean and Mr. Renier on the phone, but the timing and \ncontent of those conversations is contested. Based on email chains entered into evidence, it \nappears that Mr. Reiner learned on the afternoon of February 13 that Landlord would have a \nrepresentative at the Store on Tuesday, February 18 to identify any fixtures that Landlord \nasserted could not be removed. (APl 516-17) Mr. Renier stated that, based on a conversation \nwith Mr. Hamilton on February 12, Mr. Renier was under the impression that Landlord 's \nrepresentative would be at the Store on Thursday, February 13 to complete the identification of \ndisputed property. (Reiner Deel. 146) Mr. Hamilton disputes this assertion, maintaining instead \nthat he was not able to make direct contact with any parties until Thursday, February 13, and that \nin all communications he made it clear a Landlord representative could not arrive until Tuesday, \nFebruary 18. (11/3/20 Tr. at 128:19-130: 24; 132:20-133:9) There is no evidence in the record \nthat Debtors informed Landlord that February 18 was not acceptable .2 Rather, Debtors and their \nagents expedited the removal of the Disputed FF&E, emailing: \"hopefully [the Buyer] can get \neverything out prior to the landlord showing up.\" (AP1499-1505 ; APl 175-79; 1/8/21 Tr. at \n114:17-118:5 , 153:25-155:18) \nUnaware that removal of the Disputed FF&E was already underway, on the morning of \nFebruary 18, 2020, Landlord 's representati ve Hamilton flew from Indianapolis , Indiana to \nLouisville to identify items Landlord contended were fixtures and could not be removed. \n( 11/3/20 Tr. at 71:7-72 :6) Upon his arrival, Buyer continued to load items onto trucks, and \n2 Monday, February 17 was President's Day, a federal holiday. \n6 neither Buyer nor McLean provided Hamilton with a list of items removed. (Id. at 98:20-99:2 , \n110: 1-11) Landlord demanded that Buyer and his crew vacate the Store. It is undisputed that no \nrepresentative of Debtors, Liquidation Agent, or Buyer ever contacted Appellant to regain access \nto the Premises to make any repairs. (11/3/20 Tr. at 110:12-111:8; 1/8/21 Tr. at 99:24-100 :22, \n155:19-156:13, 189:2-16; Mclean Deposition Tr. at 80:2-16) \nD. Damages \nThe following Disputed FF &E are categories of property that Landlord claims as \n\"fixtures\" and were sold by Debtors and removed by Buyer: \na. Many (but not all) of the refrigerated and freezer display cases \n(\"Refrigerated Cases\"); \nb. The remote refrigeration system, which includes copper pipes for Freon, \nevaporative coils, 4 rooftop condensing units, and compressor /motor racks \n(\"Remote Refrigeration System\"); \nc. Most (but not all) of the hoods (\"Hoods\");3 \nd. Most (but not all) of the deli display cases (\"Deli Cases\"); \ne. The baler (\"Baler\"); and \nf. The two- and three-compartment prep sinks (\"Prep Sinks\"). \nThe Disputed FF &E required significant disassembly and heavy equipment to move, including \ncranes and forklifts. (Renier Deel. ,r,r 31-41, 48, 54, 58; AP1676-1678 (before and after photos \nof Premises); AP2136-2280 (\"Mclean Deposition Tr.\") at 77: 17-22, 82:5-84:22) ; see also Renier \nDeel. ,r 78 (regarding industry standard)) Landlord submitted extensive evidence, including \nphotographs, and it appears undisputed that damage was incurred in the process of removing the \n3 Landlord presented testimony that the Hoods were \"fixtures\" and were improperly removed, \nbut the Hoods were not claimed as part of Landlord 's damages in the Application or in any of \nLandlord 's quotes. The Bankruptcy Court found there was no evidence as to damages relating to \nthe Hoods. \n7 Disputed FF&E beyond just \"small holes caused by nails or fasteners .\" Debtors submitted Mr. \nRenier' s Declaration, which addressed each category of the Disputed FF &E purchased (Renier \nDecL,r,r 63-80), and explained in detail the method of disconnection and removal undertaken by \nhis team as well as the industry standard for such removal (Renier Deel. ,r,r 81-90). The Renier \nDeclaration asserts that, in line with industry standard, Buyer's crew removed no plumbing or \nwater lines. (Renier Deel. ,r,r 91-92 (\"In our industry, certain things are not ever removed, \npurchased, relocated, or resold. Plumbing , including toilets and sinks in bathrooms, mop sinks, \nplumbing pipes, and water lines are never removed, and my crew did not remove any of these \nitems.\") The Renier Declaration details steps that would have been taken to repair damage had \nLandlord not been forcibly ejected from the Store mid-removal on February 18, 2020. \nLandlord asserts that Buyer cut plumbing connections from sinks and detached sinks \nfrom walls, unbolting the sinks and breaking the silicone sealant used for attachment and \nwaterproofing, and also damaging drywall. (AP1599-1602 , AP161 l-1612, AP1623-1624 \n(photographs from Premises); see also Renier Deel. ,r,r 88-89 (regarding industry standard)) \nCopper pipes connecting the remote refrigeration system could not be removed unless Freon was \nfirst pumped out of them, which took several days, and drywall was damaged during removal of \ncopper pipes from interior walls and ceiling. (AP1603-1604 , AP1613-1622, AP1625-1691 \nAP2019-2023 (photographs of Premises and dairy refrigeration); see also Renier Deel. at ,r,r 37-\n39, 66, 84-85) Copper piping that was specific for the Premises , and equipment installed and ran \nthrough and under a concrete slab, was cut at grade level, leaving an exposed pipe, and was sold \nfor scrap value. (AP1642-1643 (before and after photographs) ; see also Renier Deel. ,r,r 67, 84-\n85 (regarding industry standard)) Buyer also cut wiring run directly from the electrical panels \nthrough in-wall and/or in-slab conduits to specific refrigeration equipment throughout the store, \n8 flush at the floor or wall exit points. (AP 1605-1606 ; AP 1621-1623 (photographs of Premises) ; \nAP1630, 1633, 1641, 1646, 1649, 1655, 1661-1663 , 1673-1674 (before and after photographs of \nPremises); AP1949, AP1952-1967 , AP1985-2010 (photographs ofrefrigeration systems and \nwalk-in systems); see also Renier Deel. at ,r,r 68, 87, 97) (regarding industry standard)) Buyer \ndamaged drywall at numerous locations throughout the Premises , such as where (i) refrigeration \ncopper piping previously connected refrigeration equipment , (ii) electrical connections exited \ndrywall and equipment was previously attached to wall, and (iii) refrigeration cases were \nremoved from the shopping floor area. (AP1603-1606 ; AP1613-1622 ; AP1625-1691 ; AP1943-\n1967; AP1985-2010 ; AP2019-2023 ; compare with Renier Deel. at ,r 85 (regarding industry \nstandard)) \nLandlord asserts that Buyer also removed: (i) the commercial grease trap (part of the \nplumbing system), (ii) a portion of exhaust hoods and related rooftop equipment (and jaggedly \ncut the ducts that connected the hoods through the ceiling and roof, leaving a partial, unusable \nduct within the ceiling area), (iii) heating and cooling coils for deli display cases, (iv) the baler \nfrom the loading dock; (v) the refrigeration equipment from walk-in coolers; and (vi) the roof top \ncondensers and associated motors and compressors . (AP1657-AP1658 ; AP1686; AP1937-1943 , \nAP1985-2010) (walk-in cooler before and after removal); see also Renier Deel. ,r,r 72-80, \n(FF&E purchased)) Ceiling tiles and ventilation hoods were removed and ducts were cut. \n(AP1676-1686; AP2027-2038) The polished concrete floors were scratched by the removal of \nthe refrigeration fixtures and from dragging equipment across the floor. (AP1627 , 1632, 1636, \n1640, 1642, 1646, 1686; AP1932-1936; AP1947-1951 ; AP1952-1961 ; AP1962-1967; AP1968-\n1976; AP2013-2019 ; AP1546-1549) According to Buyer, while \"[t]here will always be some \nminimal ordinary damage from removal,\" \"there was no damage [to the Louisville Store] above \n9 what is ordinary and expected from removal of FF &E. We did not damage the plumbing , the \nelectrical, the floors, or the ceilings.\" (Renier Deel. 190) \nAppellant obtained bids from Indiana Retail Construction Co. (\"IRCC\") and Bosse \nConstruction (\"Bosse\") for the cost of the repairs for the damage, and from Chef Supply for the \nrefrigeration equipment , deli cases, and sinks that were removed from the Premises. (AP1552-\n1566 (Invoice dated August 10, 2020); 11/3/20 Tr. at 111 :9-112:12 ; Larmore Deel. 1137, 40; \nAP1357-1389; AP1546-1549 (IRCC construction quote, dated August 11, 2020); AP573-577 \n(\"Howard Deel.\") 11 14-17) IRCC' s bid to repair the damage to the Premises caused by the \nremoval of fixtures and other personal property was $386,695. (AP1546-1549; Howard Deel. \n1114-17) Bosse's estimate was substantially similar to IRCC's, totaling $364,633.34 (after \nexcluding the Chef Supply bid amount of $1,385,211 and the 6% fee applied by Bosse). \n(AP1389) Debtors did not obtain any counterbids or present any evidence regarding the damage \ndone to the Premises. \nOn April 24, 2020, Landlord filed its Application for Allowance of Administrative Claims \nUnder 11 USC\u00a7\u00a7 105, 503(b) and 365(d)(3) (APl 72-335) (\"Application\"), and filed a \nsupplement to it on September 22, 2020 (AP4 78-510). \nE. Evidentiary Hearing & Decision \nOn July 9, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court held an initial hearing and heard oral argument \nrelating to the Application and Debtors' objection thereto, treating the objection as a dispositive \nmotion request. (AP437-477 (\"7/9/20 Tr.\") at 4:15-22) At the initial hearing, the Bankruptcy \nCourt found there were issues of fact and set a date for a final evidentiary hearing. On October \n29, 2020, the parties filed trial declarations in lieu of direct testimony. Landlord filed the \nLarmore Declaration and the Howard Declaration ; Debtors filed the declaration of their CFO, \n10 Andrew T. Pillari (AP544-572 (\"Pillari Declaration \"), the Wyke Declaration (APS 11-524), and \nthe Renier Declaration. On October 30, 2020, Appellant filed motions to strike portions of the \nPillari Declaration (AP66 l-729) (\"Pillari Motion to Strike\"), the Renier Declaration (AP730-\n748) (\"Renier Motion to Strike\"), and the Wyke Declaration (AP749-782) (\"Wyke Motion To \nStrike\"). \nThe evidentiary hearing on the Application was held on November 3, 2020 and January \n8, 2021. On the first day of the evidentiary hearing, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Pillari \nMotion to Strike in all respects and the Wyke Motion to Strike except as to paragraphs 10-16. \n(11/3/20 Tr. at 22:7-24:22; 29:16-23) Because the Pillari Declaration was not admitted, Debtors \npresented no evidence as to the parties' intent regarding the Lease. (Id. at 22:7-24:21) \nOn March 17, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Decision denying Landlord 's \nApplication and finding, inter alia, that: (i) the Lease unambiguously provides that all of the \nDisputed FF&E was the personal property of Debtors, (ii) all of the Disputed FF&E were trade \nfixtures and property of Debtors, (iii) Landlord did not put forward sufficient or credible \nevidence of damages, and (iv) even if Landlord had put forward sufficient evidence as to the \namount of contractual damages for any failure to repair, Landlord would not be permitted to \npursue such damages because Landlord created the obstacle that prevented performance. On \nMarch 31, 2021, Landlord filed a timely notice of appeal. \nIII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW \nAppeals from the Bankruptcy Court to this Court are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. \nPursuant to\u00a7 158(a), district courts have mandatory jurisdiction to hear appeals \"from final \njudgments, orders, and decrees\" and discretionary jurisdiction over appeals \"from other \ninterlocutory orders and decrees.\" 28 U.S.C \u00a7 158(a)(l) and (3). This Court reviews the \n11 Bankruptcy Court's \"legal determinations de nova, its factual findings for clear error, and its \nexercise of discretion for abuse thereof.\" In re American Pad & Paper Co., 478 F.3d 546, 551 \n(3d Cir. 2007). The Court must \"break down mixed questions of law and fact, applying the \nappropriate standard to each component.\" Meridian Bank v. A/ten, 958 F.2d 1226, 1229 (3d Cir. \n1992). \nThe Bankruptc y Court's findings of fact may only be overturned if they are \"clearly \nerroneous.\" Universal Minerals , Inc. v. CA. Hughes & Co., 669 F.2d 98, 102 (3d Cir. 1981); \nFed. R. Civ. P. 52 (\"Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not \nbe set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the \nbankruptcy court judge to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\"); Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052 (Rule \n52 shall apply in adversary proceedings) . A finding is clearly erroneous \"when although there is \nevidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm \nconviction that a mistake has been committed .\" Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, \n574 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nDecisions regarding whether to admit evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion. See \nWaldorf v. Shuta, 142 F.3d 601, 626-27 (3d Cir. 1998). The reviewing court must give \"singular \ndeference to a trial court's judgments about the credibility of witnesses.\" Cooper v. Harris, 137 \nS. Ct. 1455, 1474 (2017); United States v. Igbonwa , 120 F.3d 437,441 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding \nthat clearly erroneous standard of review is \"more deferential with respect to determinations \nabout the credibility of witnesses\"). \nIV. DISCUSSION \nA decision to grant or deny an administrative claim is within the discretion of the \nbankruptcy judge, and, on appeal, is subject to review under an abuse of discretion standard. See \n12 In re Energy Future Holdings Corp., 904 F.3d 298,312 (3d Cir. 2018). An abuse of discretion \noccurs when a \"judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in \nmaking the determination , or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous. \" \nZolfo, Cooper & Co. v. Sunbeam-Oster Co., Inc., 50 F.3d 253,257 (3d Cir. 1995). The burden \nof proving that a claim is entitled to treatment as an administrative expense is on the claimant. \nSee In re Phila. Newspapers, LLC, 690 F.3d 161, 173 (3d Cir. 2012). Here, then, Landlord was \nrequired to show that it was entitled to an administrative claim, and it was required to do so by a \npreponderance of the evidence. See Matter a/Columbia Gas System, Inc., 224 B.R. 540, 548 \n(Bankr. D. Del. 1998). \nA. The Bankruptcy Court Properly Denied the Application \nPursuant to \u00a7 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code \nSection 503(b)(l)(A) defines administrative expenses as \"the actual, necessary costs and \nexpenses of preserving the estate.\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(l)(A). Section 503 is strictly construed to \nkeep administrative expenses at a minimum , so as to preserve the estate for the benefit of \ncreditors. See In re Unidigital , Inc., 262 B.R. 283,288 (Bankr. D. Del. 2001). A claimant \nasserting entitlement to an administrative expense claim carries the \"heavy burden of \ndemonstrating that the costs and fees for which it seeks payment provided an actual benefit to the \nestate and that such costs and expenses were necessary to preserve the value of the estate assets.\" \nCalpine Corp. v. O'Brien Envtl. Energy, Inc., 181 F.3d 527,533 (3d Cir. 1999). \nLandlord asserted entitlement to an administrative expense claim based on the removal of \nFF&E. The Bankruptcy Court determined that: (a) the Lease is unambiguous with respect to the \nproperty that would remain property of Debtors upon termination of the Lease, and (b) all of the \nDisputed FF&E are trade fixtures under Kentucky law and the Lease. See Lucky's Market, 2021 \n13 WL 1100066, at * 10-11. Landlord argues on appeal that the Bankruptcy Court erred, as \"even a \ncursory review of the Lease reveals that it is ambiguous .\" (D.I. 14 at 21-22) \n1. The Lease is Unambiguous with Respect to the Property that Would \nRemain Property of the Debtors Upon Termination of the Lease \nThere is no dispute that the Lease is governed by Kentucky law. (See Lease ,r 32(i)) \nKentucky law provides that \"[t]he construction and interpretation of a contract, including \nquestions regarding ambiguity, are questions oflaw to be decided by the court.\" First \nCommonwealth Bank of Prestonsburg v. West, 55 S.W.3d 829, 835 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000). \n\"Absent an ambiguity in the contract, the parties' intentions must be discerned from the four \ncomers of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence. A contract is ambiguous if a \nreasonable person would find it susceptible to different or inconsistent interpretations. The fact \nthat one party may have intended different results, however, is insufficient to construe a contract \nat variance with its plain and unambiguous terms.\" Cantrell Supply, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., \n94 S.W.3d 381, 385 (Ky. Ct. App. 2002) (internal citations omitted). \nLandlord agrees with the Bankruptcy Court that the Lease permitted Debtors to remove \ntrade fixtures but not to remove other fixtures. (See D.I. 14 at 7 & 14; AP 210 ,r 11) Landlord \nargues that the Lease is ambiguous because it fails to define \"fixtures\" and \"trade fixtures.\" \nUnder the Lease, Landlord agreed to pay $1.2 million for improvements to the Premises , defined \nas \"Tenant's Work\" in the Lease, which expressly included \"fixtures,\" but did not include any \nreference to \"trade fixtures.\" Landlord asserts that it intended that the Disputed FF&E -\nconsisting ofremote refrigeration systems/walk-in refrigerators /freezers, associated copper \npiping, motors, compressors, condenser, refrigeration display cases, sinks, deli cases, and the \nbaler -once affixed to the Premises , would be permanent fixtures to remain with the Premises, \nso that the Premises could be used as a grocery store for the Debtor as well as any future tenants. \n14 This purported ambiguity, Landlord asserts, should have led the Bankruptcy Court to consider \nextrinsic evidence of the parties' intent. Landlord adds that it \"presented the only evidence on \nthe intent of the parties\" -that the Disputed FF &E were intended to be permanent fixtures -but \nthe Bankruptcy Court improperly ignored this evidence. (D.I. 14 at 23) \nThe Bankruptc y Court determined that the Lease, read as a whole, is not ambiguous with \nrespect to the property that would remain property of the Debtors upon termination. On this \npoint, instead, the Lease is reasonably susceptible to only one interpretation. See Lucky's \nMarket, 2021 WL 1100066, at *10 (determining that Lease contained \"no provisions ... that a \nreasonable person would find to be subject to different or inconsistent interpretation \"). Landlord \nargues on appeal that the Bankruptc y Court erred in its determination that the Lease is \nunambiguous (see D.I. 14 at 21-22), but Landlord's proposed interpretation of the terms \n\"fixtures\" and \"trade fixtures\" is inconsistent with the language of the Lease and Kentucky law. \na. Section 2(c)-Tenant's Work Provision \nLandlord's argument relies on section 2(c) of the Lease (\"Tenant's Work Provision \"), \nwhich defines Tenant's Work as follows: \n\"Tenant's Work\" means all leasehold improvements ,frxtures, \nequipment and merchandise required/or Tenant to open the \nPremises for business to the public that is not included in the \nLandlord 's Work. Tenant agrees that (i) all plans, specifications \nand drawings for the Tenant's Work will be subject to Landlord's \nprior written approval (which approval will not be unreasonably \nwithheld) and (ii) Tenant will be responsible for obtaining all \napplicable governmental approvals and permits necessary for the \ncompletion of Tenant's Work (which permits will be diligently \npursued by Tenant) and Tenant's occupancy of the Premises, \nincluding, without limitation , a building permit and a certificate of \noccupancy. Tenant shall diligently pursue Tenant's Work to \ncompletion. Landlord shall allow Tenant access to the premises to \nbegin the Tenant's work upon execution of this Agreement \n(\"Landlord's Delivery Date\"). Tenant agrees not to interfere with \nLandlord 's work. \n15 (Lease\u00a7 2(c) (emphasis added)) According to Tenant, because Tenant's Work does not include \nthe term \"trade fixtures,\" this provision was intended to make any work performed by Debtors \npermanent fixtures that were to remain in the Store after termination of the Lease. (Larmore \nDeel. 11 19-20) The Bankruptcy Court disagreed with this interpretation , and so does this Court. \nThe language in the Lease is consistent with controlling law on what constitutes a trade fixture, \ni.e., property annexed to real estate to aid the tenant in carrying out its business. \nLandlord continues to argue on appeal that this provision supports its claim to title to the \nDisputed FF&E. (See D.I. 14 at 22-24) Landlord cites the Larmore Declaration , which states \nthat Mr. Larmore did not believe any of Tenant's Work included \"trade fixtures\" and that all \n\"fixtures\" installed at the Store would be permanent fixtures. (Larmore Deel. 11 12, 19-20) But \nthis interpretation of the Tenant's Work Provision is not supported by the plain language of the \nLease. Instead, as the Bankruptcy Court noted, accepting Landlord's interpretation of the Lease \nwould lead to inconsistent and absurd results. For example, the first sentence of the Tenant's \nWork Provision also includes \"equipment.\" Under Landlord's interpretation, Debtors' \nequipment would not be classified as a \"trade fixture\" and would become permanent fixtures. \nRead in the context of the rest of the Lease, the plain language of the Tenant's Work Provision \ndoes not reflect an intention that any of Debtors' property -including Debtors' fixtures, trade \nfixtures, equipment , merchandise or any other personal property -would become permanent \nfixtures belonging to Landlord after installation. \nb. Section 2(d)-Tenant Improvement Allowance Provision \nLandlord further relied upon section 2(d) of the Lease (\"Tenant Improvement Allowance \nProvision\") , arguing that this provision shows the parties' intent that anything provided by \n16 Debtors under Tenant's Work would become property of Landlord and remain on site following \nLease termination: \nTenant Improvement Allowance. Landlord will reimburse Tenant \nfor the costs of designing , permitting and performing Tenant's \nWork in the amount of the Tenant Improvement Allowance \ndefined below. Landlord will pay the amount of the Tenant \nImprovement Allowance to Tenant in 2 payments within 30 days \nafter receipt by Landlord of Tenant's written request therefore , \ntogether with all the required documentation under this Section as \nfollows: (i) $20.00 per square foot of the Tenant Improvement \nAllowance within 30 days after Tenant's fifty (50%) percent \ncompletion of the Tenant's Work and delivery to Landlord of \nreasonable evidence of the same (including paid invoices and any \napplicable lien waivers of subcontract work over Twenty-Five \nThousand ($25 ,000.00) Dollars); and (ii) the remaining $20.00 per \nsquare foot of the Tenant Improvement Allowance within 30 days \nof Tenant's: (A) completion of the Tenant's Work as evidenced by \na certificate issued by Tenant's architect or general contractor; (B) \nthe issuance of a certificate of occupanc y ( or its local equivalent) \nby the applicable governmental authority having jurisdiction over \nthe Premises; (C) submission to Landlord of copies of final \nunconditional lien waivers from Tenant's general contractor and all \nthird party subcontractors and suppliers providing more than \nTwenty-Five Thousand ($25,000.00) of services or materials with \nrespect to Tenant's Work; and (D) Tenant being open for business \nin the Premises. The total of the payments to be paid by Landlord \nwith respect to the Tenant's Work will in no event exceed the \namount of the Tenant Improvement Allowance. \"Tenant \nImprovement Allowance \" means the sum of $40.00 per square foot \nof the Premises. In addition to other remedies set forth in this \nLease, if Landlord fails to pay Tenant the Tenant Improvement \nAllowance within 10 days after a written request from Tenant that \nfollows the initial 30-day request, Tenant may offset the unpaid \nTenant Improvement Allowance owed by Landlord hereunder, plus \ninterest at the Interest Rate set forth in Section 4( e) from the date \ndue until the date so offset, against Base Rent, CAM Charges and \nother payments due to Landlord under this Lease. In performing \nthe Tenant's Work, Tenant shall keep the Premises and Shopping \nCenter free from liens and other encumbrances arising in \nconnection with the Tenant's Work. Without limiting the \nprovisions of Section 13(c)(i) and subject to Landlord 's payment \nof the Tenant Improvement Allowance as and when required, \nTenant shall indemnify , defend and hold Landlord harmless from \nand against any loss, cost, claim, expense or demand arising in \n17 (Lease\u00a7 2(d)) connection with the Tenant's Work, including, without limitations, \nclaims and demands of contractors , subcontractors, suppliers and \nother parties providing materials and services in connection with \nthe performance of the Tenant's Work (\"Tenant's Work Claims\") . \nThe plain language of the Tenant Improvement Allowance Provision reflects the Parties' \nintent to set forth the terms for Landlord to reimburse Debtors for a portion of Debtors' buildout \nand construction costs for the Store. As set forth in the Tenant Improvement Allowance \nProvision, the Tenant Improvement Allowance (\"TIA\") was intended to reimburse Debtors for \n\"designing, permitting and performing Tenant's Work in the amount of the Tenant \nImprovement Allowance .... \" (Id.) (emphasis added). As recognized by the Bankruptcy Court, \nthe plain language of the Tenant Improvement Allowance Provision does not require Debtors to \napply the TIA to specific leasehold improvements , fixtures, trade fixtures, equipment , \nmerchandise , or any other personal property purchased by Debtors. It does not reflect that the \nparties' intent was for the TIA to be in exchange for leaving all ( or any) of Debtors' property at \nthe Store as permanent fixtures when Debtors vacated or terminated the Lease; nor does it reflect \nthat the parties' intent was for the TIA to be an indirect payment of or for specific items of \nFF&E.4 \n4 These findings are supported by the record. Landlord admits that the Tenant Improvement \nAllowance Provision was a material term for Debtors to agree to enter into the Lease. (11/3/20 \nTr. at 247:2-14; Larmore Deel. ,r 15 (\"Lucky's would not enter into the Lease unless Landlord \npaid significant amounts for the build-out for use as a grocery store.\")) Mr. Larmore further \nstated, \"I don't typically offer up a bunch of money to tenants.\" (11/3/20 Tr. at 247:13-14) \nDespite these facts, Mr. Larmore testified that it was always his (and Landlord's) intention that \nin exchange for Landlord's payment of the TIA, Debtors' property, specifically the Disputed \nFF&E, was to become permanent fixtures when Debtors vacated or terminated the Lease. (Id. at \n247:15-17; 1/8/21 Tr. at 19:8-13;40:25-41 :4) The Bankruptcy Court found no evidence in the \nrecord that the Landlord communicated this purported intent to Debtors. \n18 In accordance with the Tenant Improvement Allowance Provision , when Debtors had \ncompleted 50% of the Tenant's Work, they invoiced the first TIA payment in the amount of \n$601,900 as a lump sum amount, which was paid on March 28, 2014. (Debtors ' Ex. L, M) After \nDebtors opened the Store, Debtors invoiced the second TIA payment in the amount of $601,900 \non May 20, 2014, which was paid on June 18, 2014. (APP2857-2881 ) Landlord admits that the \nDebtors paid approximately $3 .2 million for the total buildout of the Store. (11/3/20 Tr. at \n255:9-22 ; APPl 709-1717) Landlord admits that the total TIA paid by the Landlord to the \nDebtors was $1,203,800. (11/3/20 Tr. at 262:21-263:9) Landlord admits that the TIA was not \nspecificall y allocated to any of the specific FF &E to which Landlord claims title. (Id. at 161: 18-\n22; 248: 11-14) The TIA reimbursed Debtors for only a portion ($1,203,800 of $3,200,000) of \nDebtors' construction and buildout costs. The Lease demonstrates no intent to treat the TIA as a \ndollar-for-dollar \"indirect payment\" of any of Debtors' property. (Id. at 248: 16-249:5) \nBased on the plain language of the Lease, the Bankruptc y Court properly found that the \nTIA provided for payment of a predetermined amount to be used by Debtors in the buildout of \nthe Store as an incentive to enter into the Lease and not as a mechanism for the transfer of title to \nLandlord. The Tenant Improvement Allowance Provision is not reasonably susceptible to a \ndifferent interpretation. \nc. Sections 22 and 23 -Tenant's Property \nProvision and Definition of Personalty \nSection 23 (\"Tenant's Property Provision\") provides, in relevant part, \"All of the \nPersonalty will be and remain the personal property of Tenant.\" (Id.) Section 22 defines \nPersonalty as \"Tenant'sfvctures, tradefvctures , furnishings , inventory and equipment. \" (Id. at \n,r 22) ( emphasis added) The plain language of this provision reflects the parties' intent to set \nforth the scope of Debtors' personal property to ensure such property remained Debtors' \n19 property upon termination of the Lease. (Id. at ,r,r 22-23) Although the terms \"Tenant's \nfixtures\" and \"trade fixtures\" are not defined in the Lease, inclusion of both terms in the \ndefinition of Personalty reflects the parties' intent for Personalty to be interpreted broadly. \nd. Section 11 -Alterations and Additions Provision \nLandlord cites section 11 of the Lease (\"Alterations and Additions Provision \") in support \nof the argument that terms used in the Lease are inconsistent and ambiguous: \nAlterations. After completion of Tenant's initial leasehold \nimprovements , Tenant will not make any exterior or structural \nalterations or additions to the Premises without the prior written \nconsent of Landlord , which consent will not be unreasonably \nwithheld. Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, will have the \nright in its sole discretion to make any interior, nonstructural \nalterations or additions or perform any interior remodeling of a \nnonstructural nature. All alterations and additions to the Premises \nby Tenant must be made in accordance with all applicable laws \nand, except for trade fixtures, machinery, equipment, shelving, \ntrash compactors, cash registers, signs and other personal \nproperty of Tenant, will remain at the end of the Term for the \nbenefit of Landlord. \n(Lease ,r 11) ( emphasis added) The plain language of this provision reflects the parties' intent to \nset forth certain property (\"trade fixtures, machinery , equipment ... and other personal property \nof the Tenant\") that would remain property of Debtors upon termination of the Lease. (Id.) As \nthe Bankruptcy Court recognized , and this Court agrees, inclusion of the catchall phrase \"and \nother personal property of the Tenant\" reflects the parties' intent that the property that would \nremain property of Debtors would not be limited to the specific property expressly listed. \nLandlord appears to argue that this provision does not reference \"Personalty ,\" \"fixtures,\" \nor \"Tenant fixtures.\" The absence of those terms in this one provision , is not, however, \ndispositive. See Lucky's Market, 2021 WL 1100066, at * 9. Read together, the Tenant's \nProperty Provision , the Alterations and Additions Provisions, and the definition of Personalty \n20 \"indicate that Debtors' personal property was intended to be a broad category that would include \ntenant's fixtures, trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and inventory.\" Id. \nThe Court agrees. The inclusion of the term \"other personal property of Tenant\" \nindicates that this is a broad provision meant to capture a relatively wide range of property. \nLandlord offers no other reasonable interpretation. \n2. The Bankruptcy Court Correctly Determined the \nIntent of the Parties from the Four Corners of the Lease \nLandlord incorrectly asserts that the Bankruptcy Court failed to consider the parties' \nintent, including the evidence Landlord presented. (D.I. 14 at 25, 28) As Debtors correctly point \nout, the only evidence of intent the Bankruptcy Court could consider, and did consider, was the \nplain language of the Lease. Having determined that the Lease is unambiguous, the Bankruptc y \nCourt was required to determine the parties' intent with respect to the terms of the Lease from \nthe four comers of the document. Consistent with Kentucky law, no extrinsic evidence of intent \nis to be considered. \nMoreover, as the Bankruptc y Court found, there is no evidence that Mr. Larmore or \nanyone else on behalf of Landlord communicated Landlord's intent to Debtors or Debtors' \nbroker while negotiating the Lease. (1/8/21 Tr. at 8-21) In fact, Mr. Larmore testified that he \nnever communicated directly with anyone at Debtors. (11/3/20 Tr. at 246:7-10) Mr. Larmore \nfurther stated that he \"intended to be bound by the language of the lease,\" clearly indicating that \nit was Landlord's intent for the plain language of the Lease to speak for itself. (1/8/21 Tr. at \n21: 10-13) \n21 3. Consistent with Kentucky Law, the Disputed FF&E \nAre Trade Fixtures Under the Lease \nLandlord admits that the Lease is unambiguous that \"trade fixtures\" remain property of \nDebtors at the end of the Lease term. (D.I. 14 at 24) The terms \"fixtures\" and \"trade fixtures\" \nare legal terms of art, and nothing in the Lease evidences the parties' intent to deviate from \nKentucky law with respect to their definition. Under Kentucky law, the common law analysis of \nwhether property is a trade fixture (personal property) or a fixture (realty) is subject to a \npresumption \"that a tenant or lessee brings property onto a landlord's or lessor's land for his own \nenjoyment , temporaril y, and not for the benefit of the landowner .\" S. Indus., LLC v. Maxine, \nLLC, 2009 WL 4060698, at *6 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2009). As a consequence , \"[a]s between \nlandlord and tenant[,] the greatest latitude and indulgence is given to the claim that fixtures \nattached to the realty by the tenant remain [the tenant's] personal property.\" Warren Post No. \n23, Am. Legion v. Jones, 196 S.W. 2d 726, 729 (Ky. 1946). \"[A]n item of property that a lessee \nannexes to realty, belonging to a lessee, and used by the lessee for purposes of trade is generally \nregarded as remaining personal property, rather than becoming real property, based on principles \nof public policy and a desire to encourage trade and manufacturing. \" S. Indus., 2009 WL \n4060698, at *4 (citing Van Ness v. Pacard, 27 U.S. 137 (1829)). \nAs Debtors correctly argue, Kentucky courts have consistently classified trade fixtures as \n\"personal property\" and recognized the right of the tenant to remove such fixtures. A trade \nfixture is \"property which a tenant has placed on rented real estate to advance the business for \nwhich it is leased and which may, as against the lessor, be removed at the end of the tenant's \nterm.\" Bank of Shelbyville v. Hartford , 104 S.W.2d 217, 218-19 (1937) (bowling alleys, \nalleyways, racks and seats and other equipment were trade fixtures). The size of the equipment \nor machinery does not determine the status as a fixture or trade fixture. See e.g., In re Louisville \n22 Daily News v. Enquirer, 20 F. Supp. 465 (W.D. Ky. 1937) (printing company's heavy printing \npress that required reconstruction of landlord's building, concrete foundation for support, light \nand power connections , was trade fixture removable by tenant); In re Heat 'N' Eat Brands, Inc., \n174 F. Supp. 598,599 (W.D. Ky. 1959) (automatic filing and conveying machine used for \ntenant's business bolted to building's floor and having power and water connections was trade \nfixture removable by tenant). \nUnder the modem doctrine of fixtures, \"the idea that physical attachment is controlling is \nexploded; the status is determined by the character of the act by which the structure is put in \nplace, the policy of the law connected with its use and purpose, and the intention of the parties.\" \nFinley v. Ford, 200 S.W.2d 138, 140 (1947); see also Holt v. Henley, 232 U.S. 637, 641 (1914) \n(\"To hold that the mere fact of annexing the [sprinkler] system to the freehold overrode the \nagreement that it should remain personalty and still belong to Holt would be to give a mystic \nimportance to attachment by bolts and screws.\"). \"At this time it is a settled rule that an erection \nmade on premises of the owner of real estate for the purposes of trade as well as for some other \npurposes is removable at the tenant's will at any time before the end of the term.\" Bank of \nShelbyville, 104 S.W.2d at 218. The common law test for identifying fixtures considers \"[f]irst, \nannexation to the realty, either actual or constructive ; second, adaptation or application to the use \nor purpose to which that part of the realty to which it is connected is appropriated; and third, \nintention to make the article a permanent accession to the freehold. \" Doll v. Guthrie, 233 Ky. \n77, 24 S.W.2d 947, 948 (1929). \n\"Regarding the first element to the test, an item is annexed to the land if it cannot be \nremoved without serious injury to itself and the land.\" S. Indus., 2009 WL 4060698 , at *2. \nKentucky courts give this element little weight. See id. at *3. Kentucky courts \"[are] against the \n23 common law doctrine that the mode of annexation is the criterion, whether slight and temporary , \nor immovable and permanent, and in favor of declaring all things to be fixtures which are \nattached to the realty with a view of the purposes for which it is held or employed.\" Doll, 24 \nS.W.2d at 948 (emphasis added). Accordingly, annexation is merely a factor to be considered in \ndetermining the \"controlling\" third element: the intention of the owner in the item's use. See \nDoll, 24 S.W.2d at 948 (\"[T]he intention of the owner as to its use ... is of controlling \nimportance in determining the question.\"); see also S. Indus., 2009 WL 4060698, at *3. \"The \nsecond element of the test, 'adaptation ,' is met when the item in question has been adapted or \napplied to the use or purpose of that part of the property with which it is connected. \" Id; see also \nDoll, 24 S.W.2d at 948. The third element of the test-the intention of the party making the \nannexation -is determinative in cases where there is any doubt as to whether an item is, or is \nnot, a fixture. \"[T]he intention of the party making the annex,ation, has been said by some of \nthe authorities to be a controlling consideration, and generally it is held to be the chief test.\" \nDoll, 24 S.W.2d at 948 (emphasis added). Intention \"does not merely imply the secret action of \nthe mind of the owner of the property, nor need it be expressed in words, but is to be inferred \nfrom the nature of the article aff1.Xed, the relation and situation of the party making the \nannex,ation, the structure and mode of annex,ation, and the purpose or use for which the \nannex,ation has been made; which, obviously , suggests that the other tests are really part of this \ncomprehensive test of intention, and that they derive their chief value as conspicuous evidence of \nsuch intention.\" Id. (emphasis added). \nWhether property is a fixture or not also requires analysis of whether it is a \"trade \nfixture\" under Kentucky law. S. Indus., 2009 WL 4060698, at *4. Kentucky law defines a \n\"trade fixture\" as the personal property of a lessee, specifically \"an article annexed by the lessee \n24 to the real estate to aid him in carrying on his trade or business on the premises[,] which ma y be \nremoved at the end ofa tenant's term.\" Banko/Shelbyville, 268 Ky. S.W.2d at 219. \"This \nexception provides that an item of property that a lessee annexes to realty, belonging to a \nlessee, and used by the lessee for purposes of trade is generally regarded as remaining \npersonal property, rather than becoming real property, based upon principles of public policy \nand a desire to encourage trade and manufacturing .\" S. Indus., 2009 WL 4060698, at *4 (citing \nVan Ness v. Pacard, 27 U.S. 137, 143-44 (1829)) (emphasis added). \"This is because the intent \nof annexing a trade fixture to the land is to benefit the business of the party annexing the fixture \nto the land, not the land itself.\" Id.; see also Davis' Adm 'r v. Eastham, 81 Ky. 116, 118 (1883) \n(\"[B]etween landlord and tenant, [the law of fixtures] gives the greatest latitude and indulgence \nto the claim of articles as personal property; the rule being still broadened with reference to \narticles used for manufacturing and trade.\"). \nThe Bankruptc y Court applied these legal standards and found that all of the Disputed \nFF&E are trade fixtures and remain property of Debtors at the end of the Lease term. The \nBankruptcy Court correctly found that all of the Disputed FF &E were purchased and installed b y \nDebtors to aid Debtors in operating their trade as a grocery store. This finding is supported by \nthe record, as Landlord 's own witness, Jeremy Hamilton , admitted that all of the items Landlord \nclaims as fixtures were sourced, purchased , and installed by Debtors for the purpose of operating \ntheir trade as a grocery store. (11/3/20 Tr. at 161:10-22) The intent of Debtors is clear in the \nplain, unambiguous language of the Lease: Debtors would retain all of their property brought \nonto the Premises, including the Disputed FF &E. \nDespite admitting that Kentucky law controls, Landlord cites multiple non-Kentucky \ncases that are both irrelevant and unpersua sive. (See D.l. 14 at 29-34) Based on the Lease and \n25 the record in this case, it is undisputed that all the Disputed FF&E were designed for Debtors' \ntrade as a grocery store and constitute trade fixtures under Kentucky law. \n4. Landlord Failed to Provide Credible Evidence of Damages \nLandlord asserts that Debtors physically damaged the Premises when they removed the \nDisputed FF &E. Landlord seeks damages \"to put the space back to original condition when \nLucky's Market was in existence as per land lord drawings at move in date\" and contends it is \nentitled to administrative expense priority in the amount of these damages. (AP 1546-1549) In \nsupport, Landlord relied on the IRCC's $386,695.00 bid to complete repairs to the Premises and \nthe testimony ofIRCC's representative Elmer Howard. Mr. Howard testified that Landlord 's \nagent, Jeremy Hamilton , expressly requested that IRCC provide a bid to put the Premises in a \n\"move-in ready\" state for a new grocery store tenant. (11/3/20 Tr. at 211: 14-212:4) Debtors \nwere not required, however, to return the Premises to a move-in ready state for a new grocery \nstore tenant under the Lease. Accordingly , the Court finds no error in the Bankruptcy Court's \ndetermination that IRCC's bid is not a reliable estimation of damages. \nMoreover, the Bankruptcy Court determined that Mr. Howard's testimony lacked \ncredibility. Mr. Howard admitted on cross-examination that IRCC only does work for Landlord \nand Landlord's affiliates. (11/3/20 Tr. at 203:2-10) Mr. Howard further testified that IRCC's \nprimary business is maintenance work, and that the average project price ofIRCC's jobs is \n$2,500 -not anything like the type of work involved in a $386,695.00 estimate. (Id. at 204:6-9, \n15-19) Finally, Mr. Howard stated on cross-examination that, notwithstanding the \nrepresentations made in his declaration , he is not a general contractor. (Id. at 205: 14-19) The \nrecord supports the Bankruptcy Court's credibility findings, which are entitled to significant \ndeference on appeal. \n26 Landlord argues on appeal that the Bankruptcy Court should have considered the Bosse \nConstruction bid. (D.I. 14 at 41) However , no witnesses testified in support of that bid, and the \nBankruptcy Court had no way to determine its accuracy or what was considered in preparing the \nbid. The Bankruptcy Court did not err in refusing to give significant weight to the Bosse bid. \n5. The Bankruptcy Court Properly Determined that Landlord \nDid Not Meet its Burden of Proving Tort Causes of Action \nSome courts have recognized a narrow exception to the plain language of\u00a7 503(b ), \nwhereby \"fairness may call for the allowance of post-petition tort claims as administrative \nexpenses if those claims arise from actions related to the preservation of a debtor's estate despite \nhaving no discemable benefit to the estate.\" In re Philadelphia Newspapers , LLC, 690 F.3d 161, \n173 (3d Cir. 2012), as corrected (Oct. 25, 2012) (citing Reading Co. v. Brown, 391 U.S. 471, \n477 (1968)). Landlord's Application further asserted entitlement to an administrative expense \nclaim under this exception, often referred to as the \"Reading Doctrine.\" \nFor a claimant to be entitled to administrative expense claim under the Reading Doctrine , \nit must demonstrate that its allegations support a tort cause of action. See generally Philadelphia \nNewspapers , 690 F.3d at 173 (affirming district court's order sustaining debtors' objection to \nadministrative expense requests on basis that claimant could not advance sustainable cause of \naction to support requests under section 503(b) or Reading Doctrine) . Landlord advanced two \ntort claims to support its administrative priority claim: (1) conversion and (2) negligence and \nnegligent supervision. The Bankruptc y Court determined that Landlord failed to prove the \nexistence of any tort that would give rise to an administrati ve expense claim under the Reading \nDoctrine . See Lucky's Market, 2021 WL 1100066 at * 12. The Court reviews these issues below. \n27 a. Conversion \nAs the Bankruptcy Court correctly noted, under Kentucky law, a party commits the tort \nof conversion when \"(1) the plaintiff had legal title to the converted property; (2) the plaintiff \nhad the right to possess the property at the time of the conversion; (3) the defendant exercised \ndominion over the plaintiff's property in a way that deprived the plaintiff of its use and \nenjoyment; (4) the defendant intended to interfere with the plaintiffs possession ; (5) the plaintiff \ndemanded return of the property and the defendant refused; (6) the defendant 's act was the legal \ncause of the plaintiff's loss of the property; and (7) the plaintiff suffered damages from the loss \nof the property. \" Ford v. Baerg, 532 S.W.3d 6 38, 641 n.2 (Ky. 2017). \nThe Court agrees that Landlord did not meet these elements. Debtor purchased , and at all \ntimes retained, title to the Disputed FF&E, which are trade fixtures under Kentucky law, and \nnothing in the Lease or the actions of the parties transferred title to Landlord . Thus, Debtors \nwere entitled to sell and remove the Disputed FF &E. The Bankruptcy Court correctly held that \nremoval of the Disputed FF &E cannot support a claim for conversion . \nb. Negligence and Negligent Supervision \nUnder Kentucky law, to prove negligence \"a plaintiff must prove the existence of a duty, \nbreach of that duty, causation between the breach of duty and the plaintiffs injury and \ndamages.\" Hayes v. D.C.I Propertie s-D KY, LLC, 563 S.W.3d 619 ,622 (Ky. 2018). There \nmust, therefore, be an agency relationship , to demonstrate that Debtors had a duty to supervise \nthe Buyer. Landlord contends that Debtors, through the Liquidation Consultant and its agents, \nhad a duty to supervise the removal of the Disputed FF&E, to ensure that removal (1) was \nperformed in compliance with the Store Closing Procedures Order, and (2) none of Landlord 's \nproperty was removed or damaged. \n28 The Bankruptcy Court determined that Landlord failed to demonstrate that Debtors \nbreached a duty. The Court agrees. \nThe items removed from the Premises were property of Debtors and cannot support a \nbreach of duty. That damage occurred is supported by photos showing that the Store was left \nwith more than small holes caused by nails fasteners and the like. However, Landlord failed to \npresent credible evidence of damages, failing to meet another of the requirements for proving \nthis tort. Landlord, therefore , failed to meet its burden of proving negligence. \nB. The Bankruptcy Court Properly Denied the Application \nPursuant to \u00a7 365( d)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code \nPursuant to Bankruptc y Code section 365(d)(3), \"The trustee shall timely perform all the \nobligations of the debtor, except those specified in section 365(b)(2), arising from and after the \norder for relief under any unexpired lease of nonresidential real property, until such lease is \nassumed or rejected, notwithstanding section 503(b)(l) of this title.\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(d)(3). \nLandlord alleged that, because Debtors breached the Lease, they are entitled to an administrative \nclaim for their damages under\u00a7 365(d)(3). The Bankruptcy Court rejected this argument. See \nLucky's Market, 2021 WL 1100066 at * 13. This Court does as well. \nAs Debtors correctly point out, \"Courts have found that damages triggered by the \n'termination' of leases do not arise pre-rejection , and, thus, are not obligations under section \n365(d)(3), but arise upon rejection, and are general unsecured claims under section 365(g)(l) .\" \nIn re BH S & B Holdings LLC, 426 B.R. 478,484 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010). \"[A]ffording \nrejection claims administrative priority would effectively eliminate the purpose behind providing \na debtor with the power to reject a contract.\" In re Old Carco LLC, 424 B.R. 633, 640 (Bankr. \nS.D.N.Y. 2010). \"[T]here is no need for a 'special rejection power' if a debtor is forced, \nnevertheless, to bear administrative liability when it breaches an agreement post-petition.\" Id. \n29 Landlord argues on appeal that the removal of the Disputed FF &E -and the damage to \nthe Premises caused by the removal- occurred post-petition, prior to rejection of the Lease, and, \nthus, the Bankruptcy Court erred by denying the Application. (See D.I. 14 at 42) Indeed, the \nrecord demonstrates that all removal of the FF&E occurred from February 5 through 18, 2020, \nprior to the rejection of the Lease. (Mclean Deposition Tr. at 25:21-26:13, 79:22-80:4; Renier \nDeel. ,r,r 27-31, 60-61) However , \"sections 365(g) and 502(g) provide, unambiguously, that \nrejection claims are pre-petition claims.\" In re Ames Dep 't Stores, Inc., 306 B.R. 43, 60 (Bankr. \nS.D.N.Y. 2004). Courts routinely hold that clean-up costs like those asserted here are pre\u00ad\npetition obligations. For example, in the Ames Dep 't Stores case, the bankruptcy court for the \nSouthern District of New York found that holding that cleanup costs are post-petition obligations \n\"would be inconsistent with the doctrinal underpinnings under which motions to reject \nburdensome obligations are made, and would eviscerate the provisions of the Code that enable \nestates to relieve themselves of post-petition obligations under burdensome executory contracts. \" \nId. at 60. That court found the claims in question were contractual claims for the damages that \nlandlords suffered after (and upon) the debtor's rejection and removal from the premises, and \nthat such claims were rejection claims. See id. The Ames Court reasoned that \"[t]he point is not \nthat the Landlords had no legally cognizable injury when the Debtors failed to remove their \nshelving and racks -for plainly the Landlords did -but rather that Congress has made a \nlegislative determination that rejection claims are pre-petition claims, with no priority over the \nclaims of other unsecured creditors, who also suffered legally cognizable injury.\" Id. This \nanalysis applies here and fully supports the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion. \nAdditionally, Landlord failed to prove that Debtors breached the Lease and failed to \nprovide credible estimations of damages for the costs the alleged damages. Thus, again, the \n30 Bankruptcy Court correctly determined Landlord is not entitled to an administrative expense \nclaim under\u00a7 365(d)(3). \nC. Landlord Is Not Entitled to an Award \nPursuant to\u00a7 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code \nLandlord contends that Debtors breached the Store Closing Procedures Order when they \nremoved the Disputed FF &E, and, therefore , Landlord should be entitled to an administrati ve \npriority claim under\u00a7 105 of the Bankruptc y Code. In accordance with 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a), \"a \nbankruptcy court may issue any order, process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to \ncarry out\" the provisions of the Bankruptc y Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a); see also In re WR. Grace \n& Co., 412 B.R. 657,667 (D. Del. 2009). Landlord contends that, in violation of the Store \nClosing Procedures Order, Debtors (i) sold Landlord 's property, and (ii) sold property that was \nnot \"moveable. \" (D.I. 14 at 44) \nAs already explained , however, Debtors did not breach the Store Closing Procedures \nOrder when they sold the Disputed FF &E. As the Disputed FF &E was not property of the \nLandlord , Buyer was entitled to remove and sell it; Buyer submitted evidence that it did so in \nline with industry standard. Moreover , the Bankruptcy Court correctly found that the Disputed \nFF&E were all moveable FF&E, as that term is used in the Store Closing Procedures Order. \nKentucky law contemplates and allows movable trade fixtures to include property that is \nlarge, heavy, and cumbersome. See S. Industrial, 2009 WL 406098, at *5 (forty-foot tall, several \nton silos described as moveable trade fixtures). Mr. Wyke testified that movable FF&E in a \ngrocery store is a broad category that can include deli cases, walk-in coolers, walk-in \nrefrigeration units, compressors , evaporators , condensers , non-bathroom sinks, and kitchen \nimplements . (1/8/21 Tr. at 123:21-124:6; 184:10-16) No testimony was offered to contradict \nthis assertion. The Court finds no error in the Bankruptc y Court's conclusion that all of the \n31 Disputed FF&E was moveable and its sale did not violate the Store Closing Procedure Order. \nSee Lucky's Market, 2021 WL 1100066 at * 13-14. \nD. No Spoliation of Evidence Has Been Shown \nLandlord argues on appeal that Debtors' spoliation of evidence required an adverse \ninference that should have shifted the burden of proof to Debtors as to when damage to the \nPremises occurred, and as to the cost of repairs and replacement of the Disputed FF &E. \nLandlord did not raise spoliation in its Application , during the evidentiary hearing, or at any time \nprior to Landlord's submission of its Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The \nBankruptcy Court denied Landlord 's requested relief on its merits. See Lucky's Market, 2021 \nWL 1100066 at *14. \nUnder Third Circuit law, \"[s]poliation occurs where: the evidence was in the party's \ncontrol; the evidence is relevant to the claims or defenses in the case; there has been actual \nsuppression or withholding of evidence; and the duty to preserve the evidence was reasonabl y \nforeseeable to the party.\" Bull v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 665 F.3d 68, 73 (3d Cir. 2012). If \nspoliation has occurred, the Court must then consider three factors in determining the appropriate \nsanction: (i) the degree of fault of the party who altered or destroyed the evidence; (ii) the degree \nof prejudice suffered by the opposing party; and (iii) whether there is a lesser sanction that will \navoid substantial unfairness to the opposing party and, where the offending party is seriously at \nfault, will serve to deter such conduct by others in the future. See Schmid v. Milwaukee Elec. \nTool Corp., 13 F.3d 76, 79 (3d Cir. 1994). \nNothing in the record supports a finding that Debtors caused spoilation of any evidence. \nThe mere fact that the Disputed FF &E was packaged and partially removed before Landlord \narrived at the Premises does not equate \"actual suppression or withholding of evidence.\" Even if \n32 the Bankruptcy Court determined that spoliation had occurred, there would be no prejudice to the \nopposing party, as the Disputed FF &E were trade fixtures and thus property of the Debtors. \nAccordingly, the Bankruptc y Court's finding of no spoliation is affirmed. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThe Bankruptc y Court properly exercised its discretion in denying the Application. \nLandlord failed to demonstrate how the Bankruptcy Court deviated from applicable legal \nauthority or relied on clearly erroneous factual findings. Accordingly , the Order will be \naffirmed. An appropriate Order follows. \nMarch 22, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware \n33 HONO LE LEONARD P.
