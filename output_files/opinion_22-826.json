SANDERS,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No, 22-826-RGA\nCENTURION, LLC, et al., :\nDefendants.\n\nCharles B. Sanders, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware.\nPro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nNovember 21, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nANDREWS, h District Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Charles B. Sanders, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.1. 3). Plaintiff\nappears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.1.5). He\nrequests counsel and moves to compel a non-party to produce evidence. (D.I. 8, 11).\nThe Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\nand 1915A(a).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nPlaintiff raises medical needs claims against three defendants\u2014Centurion,\nAnthony Jacobs, Director of Medicine, and Dr. Emilia Aduh.\n\nPlaintiff was prescribed a new prostrate medication on December 9, 2020. (D.I.\n3 at 5). He noticed changes in his urination habits and brought it to the attention of\nmedical staff via a medical grievance. (/d. at 6). The medication dose was increased,\nand Plaintiff was prescribed an additional medication. (/d.). Plaintiff asked a nurse\npractitioner why his initial medication had been changed and was told it \u201cwas too\nexpensive.\u201d (/d.).\n\nFollowing the medication change, on February 14, 2021, Plaintiff was admitted to\nthe infirmary in urination distress, where he was treated. (/d.). Medical staff had\ndifficulty with the catheter. Defendant Dr. Aduh was contacted, and she had Plaintiff\n\n1\ntransferred via ambulance to Bayhealth Medical Center in Dover, Delaware. (/d. at 7).\nAt Bayhealth, the catheter was removed and another one inserted. (/d.). Plaintiff\nreturned to the infirmary where he remained for 115 days. (/d.). Plaintiff was in distress\neach time a catheter was removed and another one inserted. (/d. at 7, 8). Dr. Aduh\n\u201cdecided to try a different prostrate drug, . . . totally disregarding Plaintiffs request to go\nback to\u201d his original medication. (/d. at 7). Plaintiff alleges that none of the \u201cexplorative\nalternative prostrate treatment plans worked.\u201d (/d. at 8).\n\nDr. Aduh ordered another catheter inserted around May 21, 2021. (/d.). The\ncatheter was not inserted correctly, and he was in pain.' (/d.). The catheter was\nadjusted by pulling it out \u201calmost all the way\u201d and then reinserting it. (/d.) By May 28,\n2021, Plaintiff's pain was unbearable and his left testicle was swollen. (/d.). Based\nupon Plaintiff's condition, Dr. Aduh had Plaintiff taken to Bayhealth Medical Center.\n(/d.). Plaintiff was treated for a \u201cmassive infection that was sepsis\u201d, underwent prostrate\nsurgery on June 10, 2021, and remained at Bayhealth until June 12, 2021. (/d.). .\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendant Centurion implemented a cost cutting policy that\nwas adopted by Defendant Director of Medicine Jacobs. (/d. at 9). The policy sought\nmedication alternatives at a cheaper cost. (/d.). Plaintiff alleges Jacobs approved the\ncheaper medication and the alternative medication prescribed was the beginning of his\nprostrate failure. (/d.). Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Aduh persisted in an ineffective course\nof treatment and was aware that the treatment was ineffective. (/d.). Plaintiff seeks\n\ncompensatory damages. (/d. at 13).\n\n1 He submitted a grievance over this. (D.I. 3 at 8).\n2\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A\\(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d /d.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\n\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\n3\n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\nasserted. See id. at 11.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u2019 that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. /qba/, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nDr. Aduh. Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Aduh continued with a course of treatment for\n\nhis prostrate condition even though Dr. Aduh knew that it was ineffective. A prison\n\n4\n\nOfficial\u2019s \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\u201d is a kind of cruel\nand unusual punishment \u201cproscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Estelle v. Gamble,\n429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). See also Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011) (when a\nprison deprives a prisoner of adequate medical care, courts have a responsibility to\nremedy the resulting Eighth Amendment violation); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n832 (1994) (under the Eighth Amendment, prison officials must ensure inmates receive\nadequate medical care).\n\nIn order to set forth a cognizable claim, an inmate must allege (i) a serious\nmedical need and (ii) acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate deliberate\nindifference to that need. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 US, at 104; Rouse v. Plantier, 182\nF.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999). A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he knows that\na prisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to\navoid the harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). A \u201cprison official may\nmanifest deliberate indifference by intentionally denying or delaying access to medical\ncare.\u201d Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 104-05. A \u201cfailure to provide adequate care . . .\n[that] was deliberate, and motivated by non medical factors\u201d is actionable under the\nEighth Amendment, but \"inadequate care [that] was a result of an error in medical\njudgment\u201d is not. Durmer v. O\u2019Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n\u201cA prisoner does not have the right \u2018to choose a specific form of medical\ntreatment.\u201d Lasko v. Watts, 373 F. App\u2019x 196, 203 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Harrison v.\nBarkley, 219 F.3d 132, 138-40 (2d Cir. 2000)). An inmate's claims against members of\na prison medical department are not viable under \u00a7 1983 where the inmate receives\n\n5\n\ncontinuing care, but believes that more should be done by way of diagnosis and\ntreatment and maintains that options available to medical personnel were not pursued\non the inmate\u2019s behalf. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 107. In addition, allegations of\nmedical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a constitutional violation. See White\nv. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 108-09 (3d Cir. 1990); see also Daniels v. Williams, 474\nU.S. 327, 332-34 (1986) (negligence is not compensable as a constitutional\ndeprivation).\n\nAs pled, the allegations fail to state cognizable medical needs claims. Plaintiff\nclaims that Dr. Aduh followed a course of treatment knowing that it was ineffective. The\nalleged facts, however, tell a different story. When medical staff notified Dr. Aduh about\nthe catheter difficulty, Dr. Aduh had Plaintiff transferred to Bayhealth Medical for\ntreatment. When problems persisted, Dr. Aduh decided to try a different medication,\nalbeit not the medication Plaintiff wanted. Finally, based upon Plaintiffs condition in later\nMay 2021, Dr. Aduh again had Plaintiff transferred to Bayhealth. These facts do not\nallege deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. At most, Plaintiff alleges\nnegligence. Moreover, while Plaintiff may have wanted to go back on the original\nprescribed medication, Plaintiff has no right to choose a specific form of treatment.\nMoreover, it cannot be said that the treatment provided was unreasonable.\n\nCenturion and Jacobs. Plaintiff alleges that Centurion implemented a cost\ncutting policy and Jacobs implements that policy. Courts have found plausible claims of\nmedical indifference where prison physicians refuse to provide adequate care for non-\nmedical reasons, such as cost-containment. See, e.g., Robinson v. Corizon Health Inc.,\n\na)\n\n2016 WL 7235314, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 13, 2016). Such claims arise when a prisoner\nalleges that \u201cthe provision of medical care was both inadequate and motivated by\nimproper or non-medical reasons.\u201d Buehl v. Wexford Healthy Sources, Inc., 2017 WL\n914275, at *7 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2017). See also Pearson v. Prison Health Serv., 850\nF.3d 526, 535 (3d Cir. 2017) (noting the \u201ctwo very distinct subcomponents\u201d of a\ndeliberate indifference claim\u2014the physician must have provided \u201cinadequate medical\ncare,\u201d and he must have done so \u201cwith the requisite state of mind\u201d). The second\ncomponent \u2014 the \u201cintent of the medical provider\u201d \u2014 becomes critical only where \u201cthe care\nreceived by an inmate was clearly inadequate.\u201d Robinson, 2016 WL 7235314, at *7.\n\nThe care provided by Dr. Aduh was not clearly inadequate. Plaintiff consistently\nreceived examinations, medication, diagnostic testing, and was taken to the hospital\nwhen necessary. Even if cost considerations factored into the decision to change\nPlaintiff's medication, the allegations indicate that Plaintiff received adequate medical\ncare despite those considerations. See, e.g., Winslow v. Prison Health Services, 406 F.\nApp\u2019x 671, 674-75 (3d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he naked assertion that Defendants considered\ncost in treating [plaintiffs] hernia does not suffice to state a claim for deliberate\nindifference, as prisoners do not have a constitutional right to limitless medical care,\nfree of the cost constraints under which law-abiding citizens receive treatment.\u201d).\n\nPlaintiffs allegations do not rise to the level of constitutional violations.\nAccordingly, the Complaint will be dismissed for failure to state claims upon which leave\ncan be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\nPlaintiff will be given one opportunity to amend his complaint.\n\n7\nCONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss as premature Plaintiff's request\nfor counsel and motion to compel a non-party to produce evidence (D.I. 8, 11); and (2)\ndismiss the Complaint for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b)(1). Plaintiff will be permitted to\namend his complaint.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nCHARLES B. SANDERS,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 22-826-RGA\nCENTURION, LLC, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 21% day of November, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the\nmemorandum opinion issued this date;\n\nIT IS ORDERED that:\n\n1. The request for counsel (D.I. 8) is DISMISSED as premature.\n\n2. The motion to compel non-party to produce evidence (D.|. 11) is\nDISMISSED as premature.\n\n3.
