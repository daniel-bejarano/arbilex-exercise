BROWN, JR.,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ, No. 22-068-CFC\nWILLIAM NGWA, et al., :\n\nDefendants.\n\nJudeau S. Brown, Jr., James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, Pro\nSe Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJuly 5, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nCONNOLLY, Chief Judge:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Judeau S. Brown, Jr., an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 1) Plaintiff\nappears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. He has filed\na letter/motion for injunctive relief. (D.I. 4) The Court proceeds to review and screen\nthe matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a).\n\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.\n2008). Plaintiff claims Defendants violated his right to medical treatment under the\nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nOn December 7, 2021, Defendant Unidentified Nurse dispensed the wrong\nmedication to Plaintiff. (D.I. 1 at 5) Plaintiff had a reaction to the medication and\ninformed the nurse. (/d.) She told Plaintiff that she would come back to address\nPlaintiff's medical needs, but she did not. (/d. at 5-6) About twelve hours later Plaintiff\ninformed a correctional officer of chest pains and nausea, and Plaintiff was taken to\nmedical. (/d. at 6). Plaintiff saw Defendant medical provider William Ngwa, explained\nhis symptoms and Ngwa agreed to \u201cflush\u201d his system in the \u201cinterest of [] Plaintiffs\nhealth.\u201d (/d. at 6-7) Ngwa did not flush Plaintiff's system. (/d. at 6)\n\nPlaintiff submitted a grievance on December 9, 2021 seeking monetary relief and\nrequested to have his system flushed out. (/d. at 7) Defendant Ephram Jeon returned\n\nthe grievance unprocessed.\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory damages. (/d. at 8).\nlll. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A\\(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison\nconditions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\ndeciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d\nCir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to\namend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v.\nMayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\n\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine\nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v.\nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that\nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Grievance\n\nPlaintiff names Jeon as a defendant because he returned Plaintiffs grievance as\nunprocessed. The filing of prison grievances is a constitutionally protected activity.\nRobinson v. Taylor, 204 F. App\u2019x 155, 157 (3d Cir. 2006). To the extent that Plaintiff\nbases his claims upon his dissatisfaction with the grievance procedure or denial of his\ngrievances, the claims fail because an inmate does not have a \u201cfree-standing\nconstitutionally right to an effective grievance process.\u201d Woods v. First Corr. Med., Inc.,\n\n446 F. App\u2019x 400, 403 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Flick v. Alba, 932 F.2d 728, 729 (8th Cir.\n1991)). To the extent Plaintiff alleges that Jeon was deliberately indifferent to his\nserious medical needs, the claims also fail, as they are alleged in a conclusory manner.\"\n\nTherefore, the claims against Jeon will be dismissed.\n\nB. Medical Claims\n\nPlaintiff alleges that the unidentified Nurse administered him incorrect medication\nand then did not address his medical needs. He alleges that he was seen by Ngwa who\ndid not flush his system, something it appears Plaintiff requested.\n\nTo set forth a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim for inadequate medical care,\na prisoner must allege (1) a serious medical need and (2) acts or omissions by prison\nofficials that indicate deliberate indifference to that need. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S.\n97, 104 (1976). A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he or she knows that a\nprisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to\navoid the harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). Prison authorities,\nhowever, are \u201caccorded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment of\nprisoners,\u201d Durmer v. O'Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 67 (3d Cir. 1993), and \u201cdisagreement as to\nthe proper medical treatment\u201d does not give rise to a constitutional violation, Spruill v.\nGillis, 372 F.3d 218, 235 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nWith respect to Ngwa, the Complaint fails to allege deliberate indifference. By\nPlaintiff's own allegations, he was seen by Ngwa who did not flush Plaintiff's system\u2014\ntreatment that Plaintiff wanted. Plaintiff's disagreement regarding the proper medical\n\ntreatment does not state a constitutional claim and the claim will be dismissed.\n\n1 See Paragraph IV.B., infra, that discusses deliberate indifference to serous medical\n\nneeds.\n5\nAs to the Nurse, even if the Nurse had been negligent in administering the\nwrong medication, an issue not decided by the Court, medical negligence without\naccompanying deliberate indifference does not rise to the level of a constitutional\nviolation. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106 (\u201c[A] complaint that a physician has been\nnegligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of\nmedical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d). The slight allegations that the\nNurse did not return to address Plaintiff's medical needs do not suffice to state claim\nand will be dismissed.\n\nThe Court will dismiss the claims raised under the Eighth Amendment. Plaintiff\nwill be given leave to amend.\n\nc. Injunctive Relief\n\nPlaintiff seeks injunctive relief. (D.I. 4) He takes issue with Ngwa\u2019s nationality\nand asks the Court to \u201cissue some sort of injunction or anything in this Court's powers to\nimpeded on nugatory foreign medical within this country.\u201d (/d. at 2) Plaintiff states that\n\u201c[t]here is more than enough natural born citizens in this country whom are highly\nqualified to maintain healthcare positions.\u201d (/d.).\n\nA party pursuing injunctive relief is confined to arguing the merits of his or her\ncomplaint. See, e.g., Colvin v. Caruso, 605 F.3d 282, 300 (6th Cir. 2010) (explaining\nplaintiff \u201chad no grounds to seek an injunction pertaining to allegedly impermissible\nconduct not mentioned in his original complaint\u201d); Martin v. Keitel, 205 F. App\u2019x 925, 928-\n29 (3d Cir. 2006) (injunctive relief motion was \u201clegally deficient\u201d because it targeted\n\nconduct that bore no relation to plaintiff's underlying claim); Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps\nof Engineers, 424 F.3d 1117, 1128 (11th Cir. 2005) (\u2018to obtain a permanent injunction, a\nparty must show. . . that he has prevailed in establishing the violation of the right asserted\nin his complaint\u201d); Kaimowitz v. Orlando, Fla., 122 F.3d 41, 43 (11th Cir. 1997) (\u201cA district\ncourt should not issue an injunction when the injunction in question is not of the same\ncharacter, and deals with a matter lying wholly outside the issues in the suit.\u201d); Devose v.\nHerrington, 42 F.3d 470, 471 (8th Cir. 1994) (rejecting injunctive relief motion that raised\nnew assertions that were entirely different from the claim raised in the complaint because\n\u201ca party moving for a preliminary injunction must necessarily establish a relationship\nbetween the injury claimed in the party\u2019s motion and the conduct asserted in the\ncomplaint\u201d).\n\nPlaintiff seeks injunctive relief for conduct not raised in his Complaint. The motion\nwill be denied. (D.I. 4)\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiff's letter/motion for\ninjunctive relief (D.I. 4); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) and 1915A(b)(1). Plaintiff will be given leave to file an amended\ncomplaint.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n"}
