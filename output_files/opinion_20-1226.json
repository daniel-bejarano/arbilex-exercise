Civil Action No. 20-1226-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nBefore me is Defendants ' Motion to Dismiss. (D.1. 12). I have reviewed the parties' \nbriefing. (D.I. 13, 20, 22, 25). I heard oral argument on December 20, 2021. (References to the \ntranscript of the oral argument are indicated by \"Tr.\"). For the reasons that follow, I will DENY \nDefendants ' motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn September 15, 2020, Plaintiffs REGENXBIO Inc. and The Trustees of the University \nof Pennsylvania filed a complaint for patent infringement against the Sarepta Defendants , \nalleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,526,617 (\"the '617 patent\"). (D.1. 1). \nThe '617 patent claims a \"cultured host cell containing a recombinant nucleic acid \nmolecule encoding the capsid protein.\" (Id. at 1 18). The patented cultured host cells do not \nrequire FDA regulatory approval. (Id. at 134). Plaintiffs allege that Sarepta infringes the '617 \npatent by manufacturing and using the patented cultured host cells to make recombinant adeno-\n1 associated virus (\"rAA V\") gene therapy products including \"SRP-9001 ,\" which is used to treat \nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (\"DMD\"). (Id at ,r,r 1, 26). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nRule 8 requires a complainant to provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED. R. Crv. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) allows the \naccused party to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to meet this standard. A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint \nas true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant , a court concludes that \nthose allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \nThe factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than \nlabels, conclusions , or a \"formulaic recitation \" of the claim elements. Id at 555 (\"Factual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the \nassumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\"). \nMoreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when \nthe complaint's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant 's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). \n2 III. DISCUSSION \nSarepta argues that the complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim because \nthe allegations in the complaint relate to activities that fall within the protections of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n271(e)(l) (\"the safe harbor\"). In response REGENXBIO argues, the safe harbor does not apply \nhere as a matter oflaw; and Sarepta's motion rests on factual disputes with regard to Sarepta's \ncommercialization of SRP-9001 that cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss.1 \nThe safe harbor provides: \nIt shall not be an act of infringement to make, use, offer to sell, or sell within the \nUnited States or import into the United States a patented invention ... solely for \nuses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a \nFederal law which regulates the manufacture , use, or sale of drugs or veterinary \nbiological products. \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(l). \nThe safe harbor provision was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Act. \"Congress \nenacted the Hatch-Waxman Act in order to eliminate two unintended distortions of the effective \npatent term resulting from the premarket approval required for certain products by the [Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act].\" Proveris Sci. Corp. v. Innovasystems , Inc., 536 F.3d 1256, 1260 (Fed. \nCir. 2008). \nThe first distortion was the reduction of effective patent life. Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic , \nInc., 496 U.S. 661, 669 (1990). \"Because patent applications were filed early in the regulatory \nprocess, but market entry was delayed pending regulatory review, the early years of the patent \nterm were spent obtaining premarket approval for the patented invention rather than generating \n1 Plaintiff The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania only joins in REGENXBIO's second \nargument. (See D.I. 22). \n3 profits.\" Proveris, 536 F.3d at 1265 (citing Eli Lilly, 496 U.S. at 669). This distortion was \nremedied by the enactment of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156, which provides patent term extensions to make \nup for regulatory delays caused by the FDA's premarket approval process. \nThe second distortion was the de facto extension of effective patent life at the end of the \npatent term. Eli Lilly, 496 U.S. at 670. Before the Hatch-Waxman Act was enacted, any \nmanufacture , use, or sale of a patented invention during the patent term was an act of \ninfringement , even if it was for the sole purpose of obtaining FDA regulatory approval. Id. \nBecause competitors could not commence these activities until the patent expired, the patentee's \nmonopoly would continue until its competitors obtained regulatory approval, effectively \nextending the patent term. Id. This distortion was remedied by the enactment of\u00a7 271(e)(l). \nSection 271(e)(l) is an affirmative defense. Immunomedics , Inc. v. Roger Williams Med. \nCtr., 2017 WL 58580, at *9 (D.N.J. Jan. 4, 2017); Amgen, Inc. v. F. Ho.ffman-LaRoche Ltd., 456 \nF. Supp. 2d 267, 273 (D. Mass. 2006). Generally , a court may not rely on an affirmative \ndefense in dismissing a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6). Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, \n234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting In re Tower Air, 416 F.3d 229,238 (3d Cir. 2005)). However, I \nmay dismiss a complaint \"under Rule 12(b)(6) where an unanswered affirmative defense appears \non its face.\" Id. \nSarepta argues that its activities were solely related to the development and future \nsubmission of a Biologics License Application to the FDA under the Federal Public Health \nService Act and are thus protected under the safe harbor. REGENXBIO argues that the safe \nharbor does not apply here as a matter of law because the patented products are not subject to \nFDA premarket approval. \n4 REGENXBIO 's argument is based on the Federal Circuit's decision in Proveris Sci. \nCorp. v. Innovasystems, Inc., 536 F.3d 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In Proveris, the patentee alleged \nthat \"Innova\" infringed a patent directed to a system and apparatus for characterizing aerosol \nsprays used in drug delivery devices by making and selling its Optical Spray Analyzer (\"OSA\"). \nId. at 1258-59. \"The OSA itself is not subject to FDA approval. It is, however, used in \nconnection with FDA regulatory submissions. In that setting, the device measures the physical \nparameters of aerosol sprays used in nasal spray drug delivery devices.\" Id. at 1259. Innova \nargued that its activities were protected under the safe harbor because it sold the OSA device to \nthird parties who used it \"solely for the development and submission of information to the FDA.\" \nId. at 1260. \nThe Federal Circuit rejected Innova's argument. \"[W]e hold that the section 271(e)(l) \nsafe harbor does not immunize the OSA from infringement. \" Id. at 1265. In so holding, the \nFederal Circuit relied on the Supreme Court's discussion of the two distortions in Eli Lilly. \nFirst, the Federal Circuit found that Innova was \"not a party who, prior to enactment of the \nHatch-Waxman Act, could be said to have been adversely affected by the second distortion.\" Id. \nThe Court reasoned , \"Innova's OSA device is not subject to FDA premarket approval. Rather, \nFDA premarket approval is required only in the case of the aerosol drug delivery product whose \nspray plume characteristics the OSA measures. In short, Innova is not a party seeking FDA \napproval for a product in order to enter the market to compete with patentees .... [ and] faces no \nregulatory barriers to market entry upon patent expiration. \" Id. \nSecond, the Federal Circuit found that the patentee was \"not a party who, prior to \nenactment of the Act, could be said to have been adversely affected by the first distortion \" \n5 because the patented device was not subject to a premarket approval process. Id The Federal \nCircuit found this to be significant because, \"[I]n Eli Lilly the [Supreme] Court spoke of its \ninterpreting the phrase 'patented invention ' in section 271(e)(l) to include all products listed in \nsection 156(f) as producing a 'perfect \"product\" fit' between the two provisions. \" Id (quoting Eli \nLilly, 496 U.S. at 672). The Federal Circuit concluded that because the patented product at issue \nwas not subject to FDA premarket approval, it was not a \"patented invention \" for purposes of\u00a7 \n271(e)(l). Id at 1265-66. \nFollowing Proveris, several district courts have held that where the patented product is \nnot subject to FDA premarket approval, the safe harbor does not apply. See, e.g., Allele \nBiotechnology & Pharms., Inc. v. Pfizer, Inc., 2021 WL 1749903 (S.D. Cal. May 4, 2021) (Rule \n12(b)(6) dismissal) ; Isis Pharms., Inc. v. Santaris Pharma A/S Corp., 2014 WL 2212114 (S.D. \nCal. May 28, 2014) (summary judgment) ; PSN fllinois, LLC v. Abbott Lab ys, 2011 WL \n4442825 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 20, 2011) (summary judgment). \nFor example, in PSN fllinois, the defendants used patented receptors to develop drug \ncandidates that required FDA approval. PSN fllinois, 2011 WL 4442825, at *l. Relying on \nProveris, the district court held that since the patented receptors were not subject to FDA \napproval, they were not a \"patented invention \" under\u00a7 271(e)(l). Id at *6. The defendants \nwere not adversely affected by the second distortion because they were not using the patented \nreceptors \"to obtain FDA approval to introduce a generic receptor to compete in the marketplace \nwhen the patent on those receptors expired. They were using a patented invention to develop \ntheir own patentable product. \" Id Thus, the district court denied the defendants ' motion for \nsummary judgment that its activities were protected by the safe harbor. Id \n6 Sarepta responds that PSN lllinois and the cases adopting the same reasoning were \nwrongly decided. (DJ. 25 at 9 n.6; Tr. at 15:22-16:3). Sarepta argues that this Court should \ninstead limit its reading of Proveris to the third-party supplier context. (DJ. 25 at 5). In \nProveris, Innova was selling the OSA devices to third parties, who used the devices to submit \ninformation to the FDA. Sarepta argues that the Federal Circuit found that Innova was not \nwithin the category of entities affected by the second distortion because Innova sold the OSA \ndevice and was not directly involved in submitting any information to the FDA. (DJ. 25 at 5). \nSarepta cites Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 2013 WL 3732867 (S.D.N.Y. July \n16, 2013) in support of its narrow reading of Proveris. In Teva, the district court rejected the \nplaintiffs ' argument that Proveris \"provide[s] that the phrase 'patented invention ' limits the \nscope of the safe harbor.\" Id. at *7. The district court instead reasoned that the holding of \nProveris should be limited to the facts of that case-i.e ., where the defendant is actively \ncommercializing the infringing product. Id. at *8. The Court thus dismissed the complaint. Id. \nat *10. I do not find the district court's reasoning in Teva persuasive. \nThe Federal Circuit in Proveris did not make any distinction between defendants who \nused the patented product to obtain information to submit to the FDA and defendants who sold \nthe patented product to third parties who used it to submit information to the FDA. Instead, the \nProveris Court focused on whether the patented product and accused device were subject to FDA \npremarket approval. Thus, I conclude that the Teva court's limited reading of Proveris is not \nsupported by the language in the case, which the district court seems to acknowledge. See Teva, \n2013 WL 3732867, at *8 (\"[T]he Federal Circuit could just as easily, and perhaps it would have \nbeen clearer, to have referred to the language 'solely for uses' as it was those uses to which the \n7 defendant was putting the patented devices that was objectionable (selling them to others and not \nitself actually developing any information for submission).\"). \nFurther, this distinction is not supported by the text of\u00a7 271(e)(l). The safe harbor \nstates, \"It shall not be an act of infringement to make, use, offer to sell, or sell ... a patented \ninvention ... solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of \ninformation\" to the FDA. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(l) (emphasis added). This language makes clear \nthat the safe harbor applies to both those who infringe by use and those who infringe by sale. See \nPSN lllinois, 2011 WL 4442825, at* 6 (\"Defendants offer no reasoned explanation why the safe \nharbor exemption would apply more broadly to an alleged infringer who infringes only by use \nand more narrowly to an alleged infringer who infringes by manufacture and sale.\"). \nThus, I decline Sarepta's invitation to limit the holding of Proveris to the third-party \nsupplier context. I instead agree with REGENXBIO that Proveris holds that a patented product \nthat is not subject to FDA premarket approval is not a \"patented invention\" under\u00a7 271(e)(l). \nSee Momenta Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA Inc., 809 F.3d 610,619 (Fed. Cir. 2015) \n(\"[R]esearch tools or devices that are not themselves subject to FDA approval may not be \ncovered\" by the safe harbor. (citing Proveris, 536 F.3d at 1265-66)). \nI now turn to the facts as alleged in this case. Sarepta uses the patented cultured host \ncells to develop their SRP-9001 gene therapy product. (D.I. 1 at ,r,r 27-31 ). \"Although SRP-\n9001 requires Food and Drug Administration approval for marketing, the cultured host cells \nclaimed in the '617 Patent, and used by Sarepta to produce SRP- 9001, do not.\" (Id. at ,r 34). \n\"SRP-9001 is currently in clinical development in the United States.\" (Id. at ,r 35). Under \n8 Proveris, since the patented cultured host cells are not subject to FDA regulatory approval, they \nare not a \"patented invention \" under\u00a7 271(e)(l). \nAt oral argument, Sarepta argued that the safe harbor should apply because of the second \ndistortion in Eli Lilly-i.e., the patentee will receive an effective patent term extension. (Tr. at \n6:20-7:2). Sarepta argued that it is adversely affected by the second distortion because it will \nhave to wait until the expiration of the '617 patent to work on SRP-9001. (Id. at 16:16-21). It \nmay indeed be true that Sarepta will be adversely affected by not being able to use Plaintiffs' \npatented cells, but the argument that this gives Plaintiffs an effective patent term extension \nmakes no sense. Sarepta is not using the patented cultured host cells to obtain FDA approval to \nintroduce generic cultured host cells to compete in the marketplace when the '61 7 patent expires. \nInstead, Sarepta is using the patented cells to develop its own patentable product. Sarepta can \nbegin using the patented host cells immediately upon expiration of the patent because the cells \nare not subject to any FDA regulatory approval process. Thus, Plaintiffs will not receive any \neffective patent term extension. \nSarepta has failed to demonstrate that the facts alleged in the complaint establish that the \nallegedly infringing activity is exempted by the\u00a7 271(e)(l) safe harbor. Thus, I deny Sarepta's \nmotion to dismiss. \nIV.
