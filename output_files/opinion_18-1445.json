Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE : \n \nBefore  me is the issue of claim construction of multiple terms in U.S. Patent No. \n5,757,140 (\u201cthe \u2019 140 patent\u201d)  and U.S. Patent No. 6,172,464 (\u201cthe \u2019464 patent\u201d) .  The parties \nsubmitted a  Joint Claim Construction Brief  (D.I. 110) and Appendix (D.I. 111), and  I heard  oral \nargument on December 9 , 2021. ( D.I. 119).  \nI. BACKGROUND \n The asserted patents have some common material, as they both descend from a patent \napplication filed in 1985.  They relate to \u201cballast\u201d circuitry used to power fluorescent lamps . \n(\u2019140 patent, 1:41\u201342).  Electronic ballasts typically have three basic parts: (1) a rectifier that \nconverts conventional 60- Hz alternating  current (\u201cAC\u201d) voltage into a direct current (\u201cDC\u201d) \nvoltage; (2) an inverter t hat converts the DC voltage into a high frequency AC voltage (e.g., \n30,000 Hz); and (3) an output circuit that shapes the AC voltage to the lamp. ( See id. , 1:48\u201360; \nD.I. 111- 1, Ex. M, \u00b6 15; D.I. 111-  7, Ex. S, \u00b6 56).  Per the parties, the following claims are \nrepresentative, and I have italicized  and/or emphasized the disputed terms.  \nClaims 16 and 17 of the  \u2019140 patent : \n16.  An arrangement comprising:  \n \na source providing a DC supply voltage at a set of DC terminals; and  \n inverter and load circuitry  connected with the DC terminals and operative to \nprovide an AC voltage at a pair of AC terminals with which is connected a gas discharge lamp; the AC voltage  being of a frequency substantially higher than that \nof the power line voltage on an ordinary electric utility power line; the gas \ndischarge lamp being characterized by drawing a lamp current from the AC \nterminals at certain times and not at other times; t he inverter and load circuitry  \nbeing characterized in that the frequency of the AC voltage is different during the times when lamp current is being drawn as compared with times when lamp current is not being drawn.  \n 2 \n 17.  The arrangement of claim 16 wherein the frequency of the AC voltage is lower \nduring the times when lamp current is being drawn as compared with the times when lamp current is not being drawn.  \n \nClaim 3 of the  \u2019464 patent : \n3.  A structure characterized by having a central axis about which the following elements are assembled:  \n \na screw -base operative to screw into a lamp socket of a type usually used for \nreceiving and holding an ordinary household incandescent light bulb; the screw -\nbase being otherwise characterized by having base terminals and by being disposed \nsymmetrically about the centra l axis;  \n \na fluorescent lamp having lamp terminals and plural cylindrical lamp segments disposed apart from, but parallel to, each other as well as to the central axis; each of the plural cylindrical lamp segments having a total length ; the fluorescent lam p \nbeing further characterized in that a flat plane disposed perpendicular to the central axis and intersecting one of the cylindrical lamp segments anywhere along its total length  creates a cross -sectional pattern that (i) is symmetrical with respect \nto a flat plane disposed parallel to the central axis, and (ii) includes nothing but cross- sections of substantially identical cylindrical lamp segments ;  \n \nan electronic sub -assembly having input terminals and output terminals; the input \nterminals being connect ed with the base terminals; the output terminals being \nconnected with the lamp terminals; the electronic sub -assembly  being operative to \nsupply an alternating voltage at its output terminals provided it be supplied with an AC power line voltage at its input terminals; the frequency of the alternating voltage being distinctly higher than that of the AC power line voltage; the electronic subassembly  being additionally characterized by including a transistor through \nwhich flows unidirectional current pulses at  a periodic rate equal to that of the \nalternating voltage; each current pulse having a duration distinctly shorter  than \nhalf of the complete cycle of the alternating voltage ; and  \n \nhousing means  mounted rigidly on the screw -base and operative to house the \nelectronic sub -assembly  as well as to hold and support the fluorescent lamp, thereby \nto form a fluorescent lamp entity adapted to be screwed into and powered from a lamp socket at which ordinary AC power line voltage is provided.  \n \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cIt is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) ( en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201c\u2018[T]here is no magic formula or 3 \n catechism for conducting claim construction.\u2019  Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate \nweight to appropriate sources \u2018in light of the statutes and policies that inf orm patent law.\u2019\u201d  \nSoftView LLC v. Apple Inc., 2013 WL 4758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (quoting Phillips , \n415 F.3d at 1324)  (alteration in original) .  When construing patent claims, a court considers the \nliteral language of the claim, the patent spe cification, and the prosecution history.  Markman v. \nWestview Instruments, Inc. , 52 F.3d 967, 977\u201380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 \n(1996).  Of these sources, \u201cthe specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.   Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  \nPhillips , 415 F.3d at 1315 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n\u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning. . . .  \n[Which is ] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in \nquestion at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.\u201d  Id. at 1312\u201313 (citations  and internal quotation marks omitted ).  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a \nclaim term is its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id.  at 1321 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201cIn some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words.\u201d  Id. at 1314. \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evi dence \u2014the patent claims, the \nspecification, and the prosecution history\u2014the court\u2019s construction is a determination of law.  See Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 331 (2015) .  The  court may also make \nfactual findings based upon considera tion of extrinsic evidence, which \u201cconsists of all evidence \nexternal to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, 4 \n dictionaries, and learned treatises. \u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at  1317\u201319 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  E xtrinsic evidence may assist the court in understanding the underlying technology, \nthe meaning of terms to one skilled in the art, and how the invention works.  Id.   Extrinsic \nevidence, however, is less reliable and less useful in claim construction than the patent and its \nprosecution history.  Id .   \nMeans -plus-function claiming allows a patentee to express a claim limitation by reciting \na function to be performed rather than a structure for performing that function.  Such claims are governed by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6,\n1 which states:  \nAn element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for \nperforming a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof . \n \nWhen a claim does not use the  term \u201cmeans,\u201d there is a rebuttable presumption that \u00a7 \n112, \u00b6 6 does not appl y. Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC , 792 F.3d 1339, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2015) \n(en banc in relevant part).   This presumption can be overcome  \u201cif the challenger demonstrates \nthat the clai m term fails to \u2018 recite sufficiently definite structure \u2019 or else recites \u2018 function without \nreciting sufficient structure for performing that function. \u2019\u201d Id. at 1349 (quoting Watts  v. XL Sys., \nInc., 232 F.3d 877, 880 (Fed. Cir.  2000)).  If \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 applies, t he court must first identify the \nclaimed function. Noah Sys., Inc. v. Intuit Inc., 675 F.3d 1302, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  Next, \u201c the \ncourt must identify the corresponding structure in the written description of the patent that \nperforms the functi on.\u201d Id. \n \n \n \n1 The priority date s of the  \u2019140 and \u2019464 patent s might be about 1980, and they are pre -AIA.  \nThe AIA \u201crenumbered\u201d t he provision t o be \u00a7 112(f).  5 \n III. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS  \n1. \u201cinverter and load circuitry \u201d (claim s 16 and 17 of the \u2019140 patent ) \n \na. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction:  \n \ni. Functions : (1) operative to provide an AC voltage at a pair of AC \nterminals with which is connected a gas discharge lamp;  (2) the AC \nvoltage being of a frequency substantially higher than that of the power line voltage on an ordinary electric utility power line;  (3) the gas discharge \nlamp being characterized by drawing a lamp current from the A C \nterminals at certain times and not at other times; (4) the inverter and load circuitry being characterized in that the frequency of the AC voltage is different during the times when lamp current is being drawn as compared with times when lamp current is not being drawn  \n \nii. Structure : Voltage -fed inverter 24 to the extent of at least one of saturable \ninductors 49, 47 whose secondary winding(s) drive bases of two inverter transistors 42, 43 for turn -on and turn- off, and whose primary winding(s) \nplus the inductor 51 / capacitor 52 combination form a series current path between ground and the midpoint of transistors 42, 43, with lamp load connectability across capacitor 52; the lamp current flowing through at least one of the primary winding(s) of saturable  inductors 49, 47 \n \nb. Defendants \u2019 proposed construction:  \n \ni. Functions : agree with Plaintiff\u2019s functions  \n \nii. Structure : half -bridge inverter with two transistors series -connected across \nthe DC output of the power supply and two toroidal saturable core transformers, an external load, a variable inductor and series -connected \ncapacitor, two bias capacitors, two shunt diodes, a  capacitor connected \nacross the collector -emitter  terminals of one of the transistors, a toroid \nheater to heat the toroidal saturable transformers and connected in series with the external load and the series -connected capacitor  \n \nc. Court\u2019s construction:  \n \ni. Functions : (1) operative to provide an AC voltage at a pair of AC \nterminals with which is connected a gas discharge lamp; (2) the AC voltage being of a frequency substantially higher than that of the power line voltage on an ordinary electric utility power  line; (3) the gas discharge \nlamp being characterized by drawing a lamp current from the AC terminals at certain times and not at other times; (4) the inverter and load circuitry being characterized in that the frequency of the AC voltage is 6 \n different duri ng the times when lamp current is being drawn as compared \nwith times when lamp current is not being drawn  \n \nii. Structure : half -bridge inverter 24 with  two toroidal saturable core \ntransformers  49, 47 whose secondary windings  53, 54 drive bases of two \ninverter transistors 42, 43 for turn- on and turn- off, and whose primary \nwindings  48, 46 plus the  variable inductor 51 / capacitor 52 combination \nform a series current path between ground and the midpoint of transistors \n42, 43, with lamp load connectability across capacitor 52; the lamp current \nflowing through the primary windings  48, 46 of  the two  toroidal saturable \ncore transformers  49, 47  \nThe parties agree that the claim term is means -plus-function.  They do not explain why \nthey come to this conclusion.  They also agree on what the functions are.  It is not self -evident to \nme that the agreed -upon functions make sense.  But, inasmuch as there is no dispute about the \nmeans -plus-function nature of the dis puted term, and no dispute about the functions, I accept \nthem.  \nAs a preliminary issue, the parties dispute the l egal standard to be applied.  Plaintiff \ncontends that  the structure should only include those elements  from the specification that are \n\u201cclearly linked\u201d  or necessary  to perform  the recited  functions . (D.I. 110 at 6).   Defendants argue \nthat the court cannot \u201cstrip down\u201d the structure disclosed by the inventor \u2014i.e., the structure must \ninclude the full circuitry disclosed  in Figure 2. ( D.I. 119 at 48:7\u201349:19).  In support, Defendants  \ncite Bennett Marine, Inc. v. Lenco Marine, Inc., 549 F. App'x 947, 954 (Fed. Cir. 2013)  (non-\nprecedential), where the Federal Circuit stated that where a patent discloses \u201conly one specific \ntype of circuit to perfor m part of the function,\u201d \u201cthe corresponding structure should be limited to \nthat specific structure and its equivalents, rather than any circuit capable of performing the required function.\u201d    \nThe issue in Bennett was different from the issue in this case.   The Court in Bennett \nconsidered \u201cwhether [the corresponding] structure should be limited to the specific circuit shown 7 \n in figure 2 or whether the structure should be construed broadly as the generic circuit shown in \nfigure 1, i.e., any circuit fulfi lling the required function.\u201d Id.   The patentee argued that the  \ncorresponding structure  should be  any generic circuit that could perform the required function, \nbut the Federal Circuit limited the structure to  the circuit dis closed in Figure 2 as it was the only \ncircuit disclose d in the patent  for performing the claimed function. Id.  at 954 \u201355.  Thus, I do not \nthink Bennett  stand s for the proposition that the corresponding circuit must contain every single \nelement disclosed by the patentee, even if they are not necessary to performing the claimed functions. \nRather, the Federal Circuit has held in precedential opinions that  \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 does not \n\u201cpermit incorporation of structure from the written description beyond that necessary to perform \nthe claimed function.\u201d  Micro Chem., Inc. v. Great Plains Chem. Co., 194 F.3d 1250, 1258 (Fed.  \nCir. 1999) ; see also B. Braun Med., Inc. v. Abbott Lab\u2019ys , 124 F.3d 1419, 1424 (Fed. Cir.  1997) \n(\u201c[S]tructure  disclosed in the specification is \u2018corresponding\u2019 structure only if the specification \nor prosecution history clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim.\u201d).   \u201cThe corresponding structure to a function set forth in a mea ns-plus-function limitation \nmust actually perform the recited function, not merely enable the pertinent structure to operate as intended.\u201d Asyst Techs., Inc. v. Empak, Inc., 268 F.3d 1364, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001) . \nThus, I agree with Plaintiff that only those  components that are necessary to performing \nthe claimed functions should be included in the corresponding structure. See,  e.g., Intel Corp. v. \nBroadcom Corp., 172 F. Supp. 2d 515, 533\u201336 (D. Del. 2001) (\u201cThe court agrees the components in Figure 8A that are not necessary to perform the recited function of the pixel interpolating means should not [ be] included in the corresponding structure of that element. If 8 \n the court included unneces sary structure as \u2018corresponding structure,\u2019 this would impermissibly \nnarrow the claimed function.\u201d). \nBoth parties agree that Figure 2 represents an embodiment of the claimed invention and \nthe starting point for determining the corresponding structure for \u201cinverter and load circuitry.\u201d  \n \n \n Plaintiff argues that the corresponding structure  includes elements 42, 43, 47 (and/or 49), \n48 (and/or 46), 51, 52, and 5 3 (and/or 54).  Defendants argue that the corresponding structure \nincludes elements 26, 42, 43, 47, 49, 51, 52, 56, 57, 66, 67, 68, and 81 (shown in Figure 6).  \nDefendants\u2019 central argument is that their proposed structure incorporates the \u201cmain \nelements\u201d of Figure 2 as identified by the Applicant .  The specification states, \u201cFIG. 2 is a \nschematic diagram illustrating the essential features of a push -pull inverter circuit particularly \nsuitable  for energizing the l amp unit of FIG. 1.\u201d  (\u2019140 patent, 3:49\u201351) .   Defendants argue that \nthe quoted language shows that the elements in Figure 2 a re the required elements of the \n9 \n invention. (D.I. 110 at 13 \u201314).  Under this logic, the corresponding structure should include \nevery element shown in Figure 2.  B ut Defendants \u2019 proposed structure does not do so, which \nseems to undercut their argument.   \nI am not convinced that th e quoted language requires that every elem ent shown in Figure \n2 be in the corresponding structure.  Th e language  does not  show that every element is necessary \nto performing the claimed functions of  the \u201cinverter and load circuitry.\u201d    It only shows that these \nelements are \u201cparticularly suitable\u201d  for \u201c energizing the  lamp unit .\u201d  The claimed functions are \nmore specific than simply \u201c energizing a lamp. \u201d \nDefendants also argue that the prosecution history of the \u2019140 patent supports their \nproposed structure.  In the Applicant\u2019s  brief appealing the patent examiner\u2019s final rejection , he \nstated, \u201cWith particular reference to Fig. 2, the invention is concisely described by claim 15, as \nfollows: An arrangement comprising: . . . inverter and load c ircuitry (consisting of main elements \n42, 43, 47, 49, 56, 57, 66, 67, 68, 51, 52 . . . .) .\u201d (D.I. 1 00-2, Ex. K  at 96).  Defendants argue that \nthis language shows that the Applicant  understood the \u201cinverter and load circuitry\u201d to comprise \nthese \u201c main elements. \u201d  This quoted language , however, was in the \u201cSummary of Invention\u201d \nsection of the appeal brief.   At the time the Applicant  filed his brief, the Manual of Patent \nExamining Proce dure required appellants to provide a concise explanation of the invention \nwhich referred to  the specification by page and line number. MPEP \u00a7 1206 (1992).  The MPEP \nfurther provided, \u201cSince the claims are read in light of the disclosure, compliance with this requirement does  not limit the claims.\u201d Id.   Thus, I do not think it would be proper for this Court \nto rely on the language from t he \u201cSummary of Invention\u201d  section to limit the corresponding \nstructure of the claim . 10 \n Defendants also point to an Amendment in response to Board Action, where the \nApplicant stated, \u201c[C] laims 15 -17 (just like all the other pending claims) are directed to the \nembodiment of Fig. 2 as implemented: (i)  according  to the modification represented by Fig. 6 . . . \n.\u201d (D.I. 100 -2, Ex. K at 143).  While this language shows that these claims cover the embodiment \ndepicted in Figure 2, it does not show that every element depicted in Figure 2 (or Figure 6) is \nnecessary to perform the claimed functions.  \nThus, I reject Defendan ts\u2019 argument that the  \u201cessential features\u201d and \u201cmain elements\u201d \nlanguage in the specification and prosecution history support their  proposed structure .  Instead, I \nmust address whether the elements identified by Defendants are necessary to performing the claimed functions.  \na. Inductor 51  \nBoth parties  agree that inductor 51 should be included in the structure  but disagree about \nwhether this inductor should be limited to a variable inductor.  The specification provides, \u201c The \ninductor 51, preferably a known ferrite core inductor, has an inductance variable by mechanical adjustment of the air gap in order to effect variation in the  level of the inductor and capacitor \nvoltage and hence the  power available to the load, as will be described. \u201d (\u2019140 patent, 5:10\u201314) .  \nPlaintiff argues that a \u201cvariable\u201d inductor is merely preferred  to accomplish a lamp dimming \neffect . (D.I. 110 at 9).  This does not seem to be the case.  The language of the specification \nstates that the inductor \u201chas an inductance variable ,\u201d and  the only \u201cpreferred\u201d language is where \nthe specification states that the inductor is \u201cpreferably a known ferrite core inductor.\u201d  The parties  further agree that element 51 is depicted  in Figure 2 using the symbol for a variable \ninductor. ( D.I. 119 at 32:3\u20136, 60:6\u201312).  Thus, I find that inductor 51 is a variable inductor \nbecause th is is the  only type of inductor disclosed in the  written description . 11 \n b. Toroidal Saturable Core Transformers 47 and 49 \nThe parties dispute whether the corresponding structure should contain one saturable \ninductor (47 or 49) or two toroidal saturable core transformers (47  and 49).  Plaintiff argues that \nonly one saturable inductor is required.  In support, Plaintiff points to language in the \nspecification stating,  \u201cTransistor  drive current is preferably provided through the use of at  least \none saturable inductor to control the transistor inversion frequency . . . .\u201d  (\u2019140 patent , 3:8\u201311; \nsee al so id., 3:19\u201322 ( \u201cAccording to another feature of the present invention, reliable and highly \nefficient half -bridge inverters include a  saturable inductor in a current feedback circuit to drive \nthe transistors for alternate conduction.\u201d )).  \nThe specification also states, \u201c Drive current to the base terminals of transistors 42 and 43 \nis provided by secondary windings 53, 54 of transformers  49, 47, respectively. \u201d (Id., 5:18\u201320; \nsee also id., 6:18\u201320 ( \u201cAs seen in FIG. 3. saturable transformers 47, 49 provide  transistor drive \ncurrent only after the current through inductor 51 has diminished to zero.\u201d ); 6:23\u201326 ( \u201cThis \ncoordination of  base drive current and inductor current is achieved because  of the series -\nconnection between the inductor 51 and the primary windings 46, 48 of saturable transformers \n47, 49, respectively.\u201d )).  While the \u2019140 patent refers to elements 47 and 49 as both \u201cinductors\u201d \n(id., 5:48, 6:7, 40) and \u201ctransformers\u201d ( id., 5:4, 19 \u201320, 6:10\u201311, 18) , the s pecification expressly \nidentifies elements 47 and 49 as \u201ctransformers\u201d in connect ion with performing the claimed \nfunctions .  (See id. , 5:18 \u201320, 6:18\u201320, 6:23\u201326).  I n Figure 2, elements 47 and 49 are depicted \nwith transformer  symbols , not inductor symbols (as shown for element 51).  I therefore  agree \nwith Defendants  that elements 47 and 49 are transformers.  Since the language in the \nspecification indicates that two transformers are necessary  to provide transistor drive current, I 12 \n find that the structure for \u201cinverter and load circuitry\u201d comprises  two toroidal saturable core \ntransformers . \nc. Bias Capacitors 56 and 57, Capacitor 68, and Shunt Diodes 66 and 67  \nDefendants\u2019 proposed structure also includes  bias capacitors 56 and 57, capacitor 68, and \nshunt diodes 66 and 67.  Plaintiff argues that these elements  are not necessary to perform the  \nclaimed functions. (D.I. 110 at 9 \u201310).  D efendants  do not appear to dispute this.  Their only \nresponse is \u201c each of these numbered components are identified by the specification and by the \nApplicant  as \u2018essential elements \u2019 and \u2018 main elements \u2019 of the \u2018 inverter and load circuity.\u2019\u201d ( Id. at \n22).  But I have already found that this argument does not support Defendants\u2019 proposed \nstructure.  Defendants have not shown that these structural elements are necessary to perform any of the claimed functions .  Thus, I decline to  include these elements in the correspondi ng \nstructure.  \nd. External Load 26 \nDefendants  also argue that the structure should include external load 26.  They reason \nthat since the claim recites \u201cinverter and load circuitry,\u201d the structure must include an inverter \nand a load. (D.I. 110 at 20; D.I. 119 at 63:19\u201364:7).  I disagree.  In the context of the claim , \n\u201cinverter and load\u201d acts as a descriptor of \u201ccircuitry\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201cinverter an d load circuitry\u201d is \ncircuitry that uses an inverter to  provide power to a load.   \nIncluding external load 26 in the structure would also be inconsistent with the claim \nlanguage and specification .  The specification provides  that external load 26 may be a gas \ndischarge lamp.  (\u2019140 patent, 4:35\u201338).  One of the claimed functions of \u201cinverter and load \ncircuitry\u201d includes being \u201coperative to provide an AC voltage at a pair of AC terminals with which is connected a gas discharge lamp.\u201d   The \u201cinverter and load circuitry\u201d and \u201cgas discharge 13 \n lamp\u201d are thus  separate claim elements.   The lamp is the object of the functions , not a structure \nnecessary to perform the functions .  Thus, I decline Defendants\u2019 request to include the external \nload 26 in the corresponding structure.2  \n In their Joint Claim Construction Chart (D.I. 99), the parties raised a dispute as to the \nconstruction of \u201cload.\u201d  Plaintiff proposes construing \u201cload\u201d as \u201creactive componentry ne ar \nwhere the lamp is connected that provides a natural frequency.\u201d  Defendants argue that \u201cload\u201d \nshould be given its plain and ordinary meaning.  I agree with Defendants.   Plaintiff has not \nprovided any reason to deviate from the plain and ordinary meaning.  Thus, I construe \u201cload\u201d to \nhave its plain and ordinary meaning. \ne. Toroid Heater 81  \n Defendants argue that toroid heater 81 should also be included in the corresponding \nstructure.   As shown in Figure 6, a toroid heater can be used to regulate the inverter output. (\u2019140 \npatent,  3:61\u201362).  It does so by \u201c heat[ing]  the toroidal  saturable inductors in order to decrease \ntheir saturation flux  limit and hence their saturation time. The result is to  decrease the periodic \ntransistor conduction time and thereby  increase the transistor inversion frequency.\u201d ( Id., 7:59\u2013\n64).  Defendants  argue that the toroid heater achieves the claimed  function requiring \u201cthat the \nfrequency of the AC voltage is different during the times when lamp current is being drawn as \ncompared with times when lamp current is not being drawn.\u201d (D.I. 110 at 35).  In support, \nDefendants point to the Applicant\u2019 s Amendment in response to Board A ction, stating :  \n[I]t would be clear ( i.e., to any person possessing but ordinary skill in the particular art \npertinent hereto ) that the inverter frequency would be higher when lamp load 26\u201d  is \ndisconnected \u2014this being so because the magnitude of the voltage developing across tank-\n \n2 Defendants also argue that the \u201cinverter and load circuitry\u201d limitation is indefinite for failure to \ndisclose sufficient structure for the external load 26.  (D.I. 110 at 23).  I disagree.  The \nspecification discloses a sufficient structure:  \u201c[E]xternal load 26. . . may comprise a gas \ndischarge device s[u]ch as the fluorescent lamp 11 in FIG. 1.\u201d (\u2019140 patent, 4:35\u201338).  14 \n capacitor C\u201d would  then be higher (due to the increased Q -multiplication); which, in turn, \ncauses the magnitude of the current flowing through the Toroid Heater to increase ; which , \nin turn, causes the Toroid Heater to heat toroids 47, 49 to a higher temperature, thereby \ncausing the inverter frequency to increase ; etc.  \n \n(D.I. 100- 2, Ex. K  at 143).  \nI am not convinced that this language requires including the toroid heater in the \ncorresponding structure.  The specification discloses  that saturable transformer s 47 and 49, along \nwith variable inductor 51 and capacitor 52 regulate the transistor inversion frequency (without \nuse of the toroid heater). ( See \u2019140 patent, 6:38\u201346 ( \u201cIt has been found desirable to regulate the \ntransistor  inversion frequency, determined mainly by the saturation time of the saturable \ninductors 47, 49, to be equ[a] l to or  higher than the natural resonance frequency of the inductor  \nand capacitor combination in order to provide a high voltage  output to external load 26. A high \nvoltage across capacitor  52 is efficiently developed as the transistor inversion frequency \napproaches the natural resonant frequency of the  inductor 51 and capacitor 52 combination.\u201d ); \nsee also id., 7:36\u201339 ( \u201cIf the load 26 comprises a gas discharge lamp, the voltage  across the \ncapacitor 52 will be reduced once the lamp is  ignited to prevent voltages on the inductor 51 and \nthe capacitor 52 from reaching destructive levels.\u201d )). \nWhile the toroid heater may be used to further regulate the inverter output, it is not \nnecessary to perform the claimed function requiring that the frequency of the AC voltage is different when lamp current is being drawn as compared with when current is not being drawn.  Thus, I decline to include the toroid heater in the c orresponding structure.  \nf. \u201cVoltage -Fed\u201d Inverter  \nPlaintiff\u2019s proposed structure would limit inverter 24 to a \u201cvoltage -fed\u201d inverter.  Relying \nsolely on the opinion of its expert, Plaintiff contends that a POSA would appreciate that the inverter in Figure 2 is \u201cvoltage -fed\u201d rather than \u201ccurrent -fed.\u201d  (D.I. 110 at 29\u201330).  There is no 15 \n support in the specification for this limitation.   Thus, I decline to limit the structure to a \u201cvoltage -\nfed\u201d inverter.  \ng. Compact Construct ion \nPlaintiff argues that this claim limitation requires \u201ccompact construction\u201d \u2014i.e., the \ninvention should be limited to compact inverter circuits  that can fit within the base of a compact \nfluorescent lamp. ( Id. at 11 \u201312).  This limitation is not reflecte d in Plaintiff\u2019s proposed \nconstruction, so it is unclear what Plaintiff wants the C ourt to do.  Regardless, I do not think it is \nproper to import this limitation into the claims.  The specification states, \u201cThe inverter circuits \naccording to the present invention . . . can be compactly constructed . . . .\u201d  (\u2019140 patent, 2:67\u2013\n3:1).  This language does not amount to a clear and unmistakable disclaimer  of claim scope.  \n2. \u201cgas discharge lamp \u201d (claim s 16 and 17 of the \u2019140 patent ) \n \na. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction: plain and ordinary meaning  \n \nb. Defendants \u2019 proposed construction: \u201cthe gas discharge lamp is disconnectable \nfrom the inverter and load circuitry\u201d  \n \nc. Court\u2019s construction: plain and ordinary meaning \n \nClaim 16 recites, \u201cthe gas discharge lamp being characterized by drawing a lamp current \nfrom the AC terminals at certain times and not at other times.\u201d  Defendants argue that this term should be limited to a disconnectable gas discharge lamp because discon nection is the only \nmeans presented in the specification for the gas discharge lamp to not draw current. (D.I. 110 at 38).   In support, D efendants point to portions of the patent  specification which describe the \ninvention as comprising a disconnectable ga s discharge lamp. ( See, e.g. , \u2019140 patent, Abstract, \n1:51\u201353 (\u201cA gas discharge lamp is disconnectably connected across the tank capacitor o f the L -C \ncircuit . . . .\u201d) , 7:50\u201352 (\u201c [W]hen the load 26\u2019 is unplugged from the circuit, the inverter stops \noscillating and the development of high voltages in the inverter is prevented.\u201d )). 16 \n I do not think a POSA would understand disconnectability to be an \u201cimportant feature \u201d of \nthe claimed invention .  (D.I. 110 at 38).  The specification states,  in a section captioned \n\u201cAdditional Explanations and Comments,\u201d \u201cThe fluorescent lighting unit of FIG. 1 could be \nmade in such manner as to permit fluorescent lamp 11 to be disconnectable from its base 12 and ballasting means 16. However, if powered with normal line voltage without its lamp load connected, frequency -converting power supply and ballasting circuit 16 is apt to self -destruct. \u201d \n(\u2019140 patent , 13:48\u201353).  This language shows that  while  the lamp may be disconnectable, there \nis a potential for self -destruction of the circuit if the lamp is designed in this manner.  To avoid \nthis self -destruction, the specification recommends, \u201c For instance, with the tank capacitor (52) \nbeing permanently connected with the lamp load (11) \u2014thereby automatically  being removed \nwhenever the lamp is removed\u2014the inverter  circuit is protected from self -destruction.\u201d ( Id., \n13:57\u201361).  Since the patent provides an example where the lamp is permanently connected to capacitor 52 \u2014which I have found to be in the corresponding structure for \u201cinverter and load \ncircuitry\u201d \u2014a POSA would n ot understand disconnectability to be required. \nI also note that i n claim 12 of the \u2019140 patent , the patentee claim s \u201ca disconnectable gas \ndischarge lamp.\u201d ( Id., 19:23).  Th e use of \u201cdisconnectable\u201d here suggests that the  patentee knew \nhow to claim a disconnectable gas discharge lamp but chose not to do so in claim 16.  See Takeda Pharm. Co. v. Zydus Pharms. USA , Inc. , 743 F.3d 1359, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (declining \nto limit claim when the inventors knew how to include those limitations \u201cwhen they so desired\u201d).  \nThus, Defendants\u2019 proposal to limit this term to a disconnectable gas discharge lamp is \nunwarranted .  I instead apply the plain and ordinary meaning.  \n  17 \n 3. \u201celectronic sub -assembly\u201d (claim 3 of the \u2019464 patent)  \n \na. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction:  \n \ni.

I again accept these agreements.    \nFor function 1, the parties  dispute whether the corresponding structure includes \ncapacitors 34 and 36.  The \u2019464 patent specification states, \u201cBecause the voltages across \ntransistors 42, 43 are relatively low (due to the effect  of capacitors 34, 36), the half -bridge \ninverter 24 is very reliable. The absence of switching transients minimizes the possibility of 19 \n transistor burn- out.\u201d  (\u2019464 patent, 5:46\u201350) .  Plaintiff argues that although these capacitors filter \nthe DC voltage and enhance inverter output quality and reliability, they are not necessary to  \nperforming the claimed function of  convert ing the AC power line voltage into a DC voltage . \n(D.I. 110 at 49).  Relying on their  expert\u2019s opinion, D efendants respond, \u201c[T]he capacitor s 34 \nand 36 ensure that the voltages across transistors 42 and 43 are steady, which aids in regulating \nthe conversion of the 240V/120V AC input into DC. They also ensure that there are no switching transients and \u2018the possibility of transistor burn- out,\u2019 w hich is a critical rectification function that \nis claimed.\u201d ( Id. at 49 \u201350).   \nI agree with Plaintiff that although capacitors 34 and 36 enhance the reliability of the \ninverter, they are not necessary to perform function 1.  I see no support in the specification for \nDefendants\u2019 contention that avoiding switching transients is a \u201ccritical rectification function.\u201d  Nor do I see this function in the agreed -upon functions for this term.  A ccordingly, I find that the \ncorresponding structure for function 1 does not include capacitors 34 and 36. \nI will adopt the remaining portion of Defendants\u2019 proposed structure  for function 1 as this \nis the structure disclosed in the specification for  performing the claimed functionality . (See \u2019464 \npatent, 3: 7\u201324 ( \u201c[A] power supply 23, connected to a conventional AC input, provides a DC \noutput for s upplying a high- efficiency inverter circuit 24.  . . . \n The power s upply 23 comprises \nbridge rectifier having four diodes 27, 28, 29 and 31 connectable to a 240 volt AC  supply at \nterminals 32, 33. . . . The power s upply 23 also comprises a voltage  doubler and rectifier \noptionally connectable to a 120 volt AC  input taken between the ground line 37 and terminal 33 \nor 32. The voltage doubler and rectifier means provides a direct  electrical connection by way of \nline 37 [b]etween one of the  120 volt AC power input lines and the inverter 24, as shown in FIG. \n2.\u201d)). 20 \n  For functions  2\u20134, the parties  simply  repeat their arguments from the \u201cinverter and load \ncircuitry\u201d  term.  (See D.I. 110 at 44\u201348).

(D.I. 110 at 53).  I disagree.  Simply because there is a functional limitation in a \nstructural claim does not convert some portion of the claim to be means -plus-function.  A POSA \nwould understand the term \u201cscrew -base\u201d to recit e a sufficiently definite structure  in light of the \ndisclosures in the specification .  \n \n3 Many of Defendants\u2019 arguments for \u201cinverter and load circuitry\u201d were based on the  prosecution \nhistory of the \u2019140 patent.  Yet, Defendants fail to explain how  that prosecution history applies to \nthe construction of a term in the \u2019464 patent  (which is not a continuation of the \u2019140 patent).  \nWhile I am not convinced that I can consider the \u2019140 patent prosecution history for this claim \nterm, I do not need to decide the issue, as I did not rely on the prosecution history in construing \u201cinverter and load circuitry.\u201d  21 \n Figure 1 of the \u2019464 patent shows a \u201cfluorescent lamp unit adapted for screw -in insertion \ninto a standard Edison incandes cent socket.\u201d (\u2019464 patent, 2:23\u201325).  \n \n \nThe \u201cscrew -base\u201d is depicted as element 19 in Figure 1 . (Id., 9:10).  In light of Figure 1, a \nPOSA would understand that \u201cscrew -base\u201d is the base of the lightbulb which can be screwed into \na lamp socket.  Defendants argue that since the \u2019464 paten t also refers to element 19 as \u201cscrew -\ntype plug,\u201d a POSA would be confused as to the scope of this term. ( D.I. 119 at 106:22\u2013107:17).  \nI am not convinced that a POSA  would have any trouble understanding the term \u201cscrew -base\u201d in \nthe context of claim 3  even if the inventor was inconsistent in how he referred to element 19.  \nThe claims only use the term \u201cscrew -base\u201d (not \u201cscrew -type plug\u201d) and the specification clearly \nassociates \u201cscrew -base\u201d with element 19. (\u2019464 patent, 9:10).  \nThus, I apply the plain and ordinary meaning, which is, as always, the default in claim \nconstruction.

(D.I. 119 at 111:20\u2013113:1).  This \nargument is one of non- infringement, not indefiniteness, and is more appropriately resolved at \nsummary judgment .  Defendants also argue that the patent does not provide \u201cobjective \nboundaries\u201d for a POSA to determine what \u201ct otal length\u201d  means.  (D.I. 110 at 60).

In  the context of claim 3 , a POSA \nwould understand that the \u201ctotal length\u201d of the lamp segments is the length where the segments 23 \n are parallel.   Thus , this term is not indefinite.  Instead, I give \u201ctotal length\u201d its plain and ordinary \nmeaning as it is an ordinary phrase that a jury would easily understand.  \nDefendants  alternatively  argue that , in the full claim term proposed for construction, the  \nfluorescent  lamp should be limited to a U -shaped lamp.  In support, Defendants point to \nstatements made by the patent examiner in a non- final rejection  and again in a final rejection  of \nclaim 10 (a previous version of claim 3) .  The examiner found that a prior art reference \u201cclearly \ndiscloses everything recited except for the U -shaped lamp tube structure  and the lack of a globe \u201d \nbut that it would have  been obvious  to modify the prior art to use a U -shaped tube structure. ( D.I. \n99-8, Ex. H  at 109\u201310) .  On appeal of this rejection, the Applicant  argued, \u201cAs still another \nmatter of elementary fact, Applicant herewith makes Examiner aware that, when using a \u2018U -\nshaped t ube structure\u2019 so as to eliminate Abernathy\u2019s \u2018lead 27,\u2019 each leg of the \u2018U -shaped tube\u2019 \nwould cast a shadow with respect to the light emitted from the other leg.\u201d ( Id. at 64).  In its \ndecision on appeal, the Board stated, \u201cThe disclosed invention is direc ted to a U -shaped \nfluorescent lamp . . . .\u201d ( Id. at 18).   \nI do not think the Applicant \u2019s statements amount to a clear and unmistakable disavowal \nof claim scope or \u201cacquiescence\u201d to a narrower claim scope.  But the fact that the examiner , the \napplicant, and the Board all seemed to agree that the claimed invention was limited to a  U-\nshaped lamp tube structure  does  provide evidence of how one of skill in the art understood the \nscope of the claims .  In light of the prosecution history and the fact that the only embodiment of \nthe lamp is a U -shaped lamp (Figure  1), I find that a POSA would understand that the \n\u201cfluorescent lamp \u201d in claim 3  is a U-shaped lamp.  \n \n 24 \n 6. \u201ceach current pulse having a duration distinctly shorter  than half of the complete \ncycle of the alternating voltage \u201d (claim  3 of the \u2019464 patent)  \n \na.

Cir. 2014) ). \nPlaintiff claims that this term is not indefinite because \u201cdistinctly\u201d has a common \nmeaning : \u201cin a way that is very noticeable or apparent.\u201d (D.I. 110 at 68 (citing dictionary \ndefinition) ).  At other points in its argument, Plaintiff argues that \u201cdistinctly shorter\u201d means \n\u201cdetectably shorter ,\u201d \u201cdiscernably shorter ,\u201d or shorter \u201coutside the realm of measurement error.\u201d \n(Id. at 66, 69;  D.I. 119 at 125: 7\u201317).  Plaintiff\u2019s proposed interpretations essentially equate the \nterm \u201cdistinctly shorter\u201d with \u201cshorter,\u201d which is improper. See Merck & Co. v. Teva Pharm. 25 \n USA, Inc., 395 F.3d 1364, 1372 (Fed. Cir.  2005) (\u201cA claim construction that gives meaning to all \nthe terms of the claim is preferred over one that does not do so.\u201d).4 \nPlaintiff\u2019s interpretation would not only render the term \u201cdistinctly \u201d superfluous, but it \nwould also be inconsistent with the patent\u2019s use of the  term \u201cdistinctly.\u201d  Claim 3 also recites \n\u201cthe frequency of the alternating voltage being distinctly  higher than that of the AC power line \nvoltage .\u201d (\u2019464 patent, 11:25\u201327) .  The specification explains  that the frequency  of the inverter \ncircuit is typically between 20 and 40 kHz , while the ordinary AC power line voltage is 60 Hz. \n(Id., 2:65, 8:19\u201325).  The  frequency of the inverter circuit is approximately 1,000 times higher \nthan the AC power line voltage , so \u201cdistinctly  higher\u201d in claim 3 corresponds to approximately \n\u201c1,000 times higher .\u201d  This use of \u201cdistinctly\u201d to represent different orders of magnitude is \ninconsistent with the argument that \u201cdistinctly\u201d means \u201cdetectably\u201d or \u201coutside the realm of \nmeasurement error.\u201d  \nAlthough I reject Plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of this term, I will not find this term indefinite.  \nThere are at least two examples provided in the specification that provide objective boundaries for a POSA  to determine the scope of \u201cdist inctly shorter.\u201d   \nFirst, Figure 3C shows the waveforms of the current through transistor 42. ( Id., 4:12\u201315) .  \n \n4 At oral argument, Plaintiff c ontended that in some cases, the court may construe a claim term in \na way that makes a word in the claim superfluous. (D.I. 119 at 133:14\u201319).  Plaintiff then filed a \nsupplemental letter citing to cases where the Federal Circuit has done so. (D.I. 116 at 1\u20132; see also D.I. 118).  These cases, however, permitted surplusage where the intrinsic evidence compelled an alternative construction. See, e.g., ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH v. Canady Tech. LLC, 629 F.3d 1278, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2010) .  Here, Plaintiff points to nothing in the specification \nor prosecution history that would compel the court to adopt a superfluous construction. 26 \n   \n\u201cAs shown in FIG. 3c, current -flow in transistor 43 terminates at the end of period I.\u201d \n(Id., 4:27\u201329) .  This figure shows a transistor current pulse having a duration \u201c distinctly shorter \u201d \nthan half of the complete cycle of the alternating voltage , which is  shown in Figure 3A (time \nperiods I \u2013VI).    \nSecond, the specification states , \u201c[T]he conduction period of each transistor is desirably  \nshorter in duration than one quarter of the full period corresponding to the natural resonant \nfrequency of the  inductor and capacitor combination.\u201d ( Id., 5:18\u201322) .  \nFigure 3C and the \u201cdesirably shorter\u201d language in the specification provide points of \ncomparison for POSAs to determine whether  a potentially infringing product has a transistor \ncurrent pulse with a duration \u201cdistinctly shorter\u201d  than half of the complete cycle of the \naltern ating voltage. See Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Applera Corp., 599 F.3d 1325, 1335\u201336 (Fed. Cir. \n2010) .  While I do not find this term to be indefinite, I will construe this term consistent with the  \nexamples provided in the specification\u2014i.e., \u201ceach current pulse having a duration shorter than \n27 \n one quarter of the complete cycle of the alternating voltage .\u201d5  This  seems to be what the \npatentee meant by \u201cdistinctly shorter .\u201d  In light of the disclosures in the specification, a POSA \nwould readily understand  that \u201cdistinctly shorter than half\u201d means \u201cshorter than one quarter .\u201d \n7. \u201chousing means \u201d (claim  3 of the \u2019464 patent)  \n \na. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction:  \n \ni. Functions : (1) being operative to house the electronic sub- assembly ( 2) as \nwell as to hold and support the fluorescent lamp, ( 3) thereby to form a \nfluorescent lamp entity adapted to be screwed into and powered from a \nlamp socket at which an ordinary AC power line voltage is provided  \n \nii. Structure : Compact integral base 12 houses and fits within it frequency-\nconverting power supply and ballasting circuit 16, secures folded fluorescent lamp 11, and forms a fluorescent lamp entity adapted to be screwed into and powered from a lamp socket at which an ordinary AC power line voltage is provided by way of screw base 19 and leads 17, 18  \n \nb. Defendants \u2019 proposed construction:  \n \ni. Functions : (1) being operative to house the electronic sub- assembly (2) as \nwell as to hold and support the fluorescent lamp  \n \nii. Structure : A housing unit that cannot be disconnected from the screw -type \nplug, in which a ballasting circuit is wholly contained, a ground- plane, a \nmanually rotatable external knob connected to a variable inductor, two cathodes, and two leads  \n \nc. Court\u2019s construction:  \n \ni. Functions : (1) being operative to house the electronic sub- assembly (2) as \nwell as to hold and support the fluorescent lamp  \n \nii. Structure : Compact integral base 12 houses and fits within it frequency-\nconverting power supply and ballasting circuit 16, and secures folded \nfluorescent lamp 11  \n \n5 Defendants\u2019 alternative proposed construction refers to the \u201cresonant frequency of the inductor \nand capacitor combination\u201d instead of the \u201cfrequency of the alternating voltage.\u201d   Defendants  \nclaim, \u201c[T]he reference to the resonant frequency is readily understood as equivalent to the frequency of the alternating voltage.\u201d (D.I. 110 at 68).  While Plaintiff seem s to agree with this \nproposition ( see id.  at 69 ), I see no reason to deviate from the language of the claims as it will \nunnecessarily confuse the jury. 28 \n  \nThis term is a means -plus-function term.  \nDefendants agree with Plaintiff\u2019s first two proposed functions but  disagree with \nPlaintiff\u2019s third function: \u201c thereby to form a fluorescent lamp entity adapted to be screwed into \nand powered from a lamp socket at which an ordinary AC power line voltage is provided.\u201d   \nDefendants argue that the \u201cthereby\u201d clause at the end of claim 3  modifies  the two earlier \nfunctions . (D.I. 110 at 72).  I agree.  This clause describes  the result of the two disclosed \nfunctions of the housing means, not an additional functional feature.  Thus, I decline to include \nthe \u201cthereby\u201d clause as a claimed function.  \nPlaintiff\u2019s proposed structure ( omitting  the structure relating to the third function) \ncorresponds with the claimed functions a nd comports with the specification\u2019s disclosures . (See \n\u2019464 patent, 2:55\u201361 ( \u201cFIG. 1 illustrates a s crew -in gas discharge lamp unit 10 comprising a \nfolded fluorescent lamp 11 s uitably s ecured to  an integral base 12. The lamp comprises two \ncathodes 13, 14 which are supplied with the requisite high operating voltage  from a frequency -\nconverting power s upply and ballasting circuit 16, which, because of its compact size, \nconvenient ly fits within the base 12.\u201d )). \nDefendants argue that this structure sho uld also include a ground plane and a manually \nrotatable external knob.  I disagree.  Neither of these structures are necessary to perform any \nclaimed function.  The patent provides, \u201c A ground plane comprising a wire or metallic s trip 21 is  \ndisposed adjacent a portion of the fluorescent lamp 11 as a  starting aid.\u201d ( Id., 2:65\u20133:1).  \nDefendants contend that this language shows that the ground plane  helps \u201csupport\u201d the \nfluorescent lamp 11. (D.I. 110 at 74).  I see no basis for this argument.  The purpose of the \nground plane  is to act as \u201cstarting aid\u201d  for a lamp,  which is unrelated to the claimed functions.  29 \n The manually rotatable external knob controls the  \u201cvariation of the lamp illumination \nintensity .\u201d (\u2019464 patent, 3:1\u20136).   The knob is not necessary to house the electronic sub- assembly \nor support the lamp.  \nThus, I adopt Plaintiff\u2019s proposed structure as it relates to the two claimed functions. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n Within five days the parties shall submit a proposed order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion suitable for submission to the jury.   \n "}
