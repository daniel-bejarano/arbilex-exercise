IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPlaintiff, \nCivil Action No. 22-1506-RGA \nWILSON C. CHOY, M.D., et al., \nDefendants . \nMEMORANDUM \nThis is a medical malpractice case. (D.I. 1, 15). The original complaint alleged medical \nnegligence against three defendants , each claim being in a separate count. Jurisdiction is based \non diversity of citizenship. Defendants , a doctor and two hospitals, filed motions for in camera \nreview of the \"affidavit of merit\" to determine whether Plaintiff had complied with the Delaware \naffidavit of merit statute. (D.I. 32, 33, 34). Upon cursory review of the two sealed filings (D.I. \n23, 26), I did not see anything that looks like an affidavit, let alone an affidavit of merit. I issued \nan order to show cause to give Plaintiff an opportuni ty to direct me to any affidavits of merit. \n(D.I. 64). The deadline passed without any relevant response. \nThe legal issue is whether a federal court sitting in diversity is bound to apply the \naffidavit of merit statute as state substantive law. In the earlier briefing on the motions, Plaintiff \nessentially conceded that the Court of Appeals has ruled on essentiall y the same issue in the \ncontext of the Pennsylvania \"certificate of merit\" statute. See Liggon-Redding v. Estate of \nRobert Sugarman , 659 F.3d 258, 259-65 (3d Cir. 2011) (legal malpractice). The Third Circuit \nhas also ruled on the same issue in the context of the ew Jersey \"affidavit of merit\" statute. See \nPage l of 3 Nuveen Mun. Trust ex rel. Nuveen High Yield Mun. Bond Fund v. WithumSmith Brown, P. C., \n692 F.3d 283, 302-04 (3d Cir. 2012) (accounting malpractice; legal malpractice); Chamberlain v. \nGiampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 156-61 (3d Cir. 2000) (medical malpractice). \nThe Delaware statute , 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853, is essentially the same as its Pennsylvania and \nNew Jersey counterparts. It states in relevant part: \no health-care negligence lawsuit shall be filed in this State unless the complaint is \naccompanied by: \nAn affidavit of merit as to each defendant signed by an expert witness, as defined in \u00a7 \n6854 of this title, and accompanied by a current curriculum vitae of the witness, stating \nthat there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been health-care medical \nnegligence committed by each defendant. ... The affidavit or affidavits of merit shall set \nforth the expert's opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the applicable \nstandard of care was breached by the named defendant or defendants and that the breach \nwas a proximate cause of injury or injuries claimed in the complaint. An expert signing an \naffidavit of merit shall be licensed to practice medicine as of the date of the affidavit; and \nin the 3 years immediately preceding the alleged negligent act has been engaged in the \ntreatment of patients and/or in the teaching/academic side of medicine in the same or \nsimilar field of medicine as the defendant or defendants, and the expert shall be Board \ncertified in the same or similar field of medicine if the defendant or defendants is Board \ncertified. \n18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853 ( a)( 1) & ( c ). Thus, the affidavit of merit at a minimum must be signed, sworn, \nand express relevant opinions about culpability . \nPlaintiffs argument is that other circuits have ruled differentl y, and he predicts the Third \nCircuit will now hold that the affidavit of merit statutes are state procedural law, not state \nsubstantive law. In effect, Plaintiff argues that the Third Circuit will overrule its decisions in \nNuveen and the earlier cases. I do not think that is likely, and, in any event, I cannot overrule \nThird Circuit cases. The Delaware statute is substantive law, and I need to apply it. Thus, I \nreject Plaintiffs main argument. \nPlaintiff, in the alternative, states that he has complied with the affidavit of merit \nrequirements by filing internet printouts about two doctors and some of Plaintiffs medical \nPage 2 of 3 records. (D.I. 37 at 18). Plaintiff does not point to any signed and sworn opinions about \nculpability authored by his two named experts. Indeed, there is nothing to indicate that the two \ndoctors even know that he has submitted them as experts in this case. \nIn the middle of the briefing on the motions for in camera review, Plaintiff filed an \namended complaint. (D.I. 38). It added counts for assault and battery against two Defendants , \nand failure to train against the third Defendant. Plaintiff subsequently moved to withdraw the \nthree additional counts. (D.I. 53). I do not see that the motion is opposed. I therefore will grant \nit. \nI will enter a separate order dismissing Plaintiff's three medical negligence counts \nwithout prejudice . \nEntered this f/!!;;.y of April 2023. \nPage 3 of 3 HAROLD R. BERK, \nV. IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPlaintiff, \nCivil Action No. 22-1506-RGA \nWILSON C. CHOY, M.D., et al., \nDefendants. \nORDER DISMISSING CASE \nFor the reasons stated in the accompanying Memorandum , upon review of Defendants' \nmotions for in camera review of affidavit of merit (D .I. 3 2, 3 3, 34 ), I have determined Plaintiff \nhas not complied with Delaware 's affidavit of merit statute. 1 Plaintiffs three medical negligence \ncounts are DISMISSED without prejudice. Plaintiffs motion to withdraw fourth, fifth, and \nsixth causes of action (D.I. 53) is GRANTED. The other pending motions (D.I. 44, 46, 50, 72) \nare DISMISSED as moot. As all claims have been dismissed or withdrawn, the Clerk of Court \nis directed to CLOSE the case. ~ \nIT IS SO ORDERED this lj_ day of April 2023. \n1 I GRANT Plaintiffs motion for leave to file a sur-reply . (D.I. 42). "}
