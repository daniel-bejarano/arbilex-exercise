(D.I. 176).  For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Defendant\u2019s \nmotion.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn June 27, 2019, Plaintiff Alicia A. Cohen (\u201cPlaintiff \u201d) filed a Co mplaint against her \nfather, Defendant Ronald A. Cohen1 (\u201cDefendant\u201d) , and filed an amended complaint against him \non February 14, 2020.  (D.I. 1, 32).  Plaintiff alleged that she had been sexually abused, raped, and \ntrafficked by Defendant from the time sh e was three to five  years old until she was eleven  years \nold.  (D.I. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 8\u201349).  The incidents in the Amended Complaint  are alleged to have occurred \nfrom 1983 to 1992, but Plaintiff claimed to have forgotten these events until around the time she \nbrought  suit because \u201c[i]in order to cope and survive, [she] repressed the memories of what \nDefendant did to her.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 50).   Plaintiff asserted that her memories began to be restored in \n2013\u20132014 and continued to be restored until as late as 2018.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 51 \u201352).  Defendant denied \nall allegation s.  (D.I. 34).  \nOver the course of a five -day jury trial, the parties tried sixteen  counts arising from federal, \nDelaware, New Jersey, and Florida law .  (D.I 171\u2013175).  The jury found Defendant liable on five \nof the sixteen counts:  Count II  (Delaware Law \u2013 Sexual Abuse of a Minor), Count III (Delaware \nLaw \u2013 Assault or Battery), Count IV  (Delaware Law \u2013 Intentional Infliction of Emotional \nDistress), Count V (Delaware Law \u2013 Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress), and Count VI \n(Delaware Law \u2013 False Imprisonment) .  (D.I. 160).  For Count II, the jury indicated that Plaintiff \nhad proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant had committed incest, sexual \n \n1  As indicated by the case caption, Defendant is and has been known by other names.  2 extortion, continuous sexual abuse of a child, indecent exposure, and offensive touching.  ( Id. at \n2).  The jury awarded Plaintiff $750,000 in compensatory damages and another $750,000 in \npunitive damages.  ( Id. at 6).  \nDefendant now brings a renewed  motion for judgment as a matter of law , or, alternatively, \nmoves for a new trial .  (D.I. 176).  Defendant\u2019s motion has two  bases.  First, Defendant argues that \nCount II must be vacate d as a matter of law because there was insufficient evidence for a jury to \nfind him  liable.  Second, Defendant argues that the counts he was found liable for are time -barred \nunder the applicable statute of limitations .  (See D.I. 177, 181).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Judgment as a Matter of Law  \nThe Court will only consider Rule 50(b) arguments if they were properly preserved.  To \npreserve an issue for a renewed judgment as a matter of law, the moving party \u201cmust timely move \nfor judgment as a matter of law at the close of the nonmovant \u2019s case, pursuant to Rule 50(a), and \nspecify the grounds for that motion.\u201d   Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1172 \n(3d Cir. 1993) .  A party\u2019s  Rule 50(a) motion must be \u201c sufficiently specific to afford the party \nagainst whom the motion is directed with an opportunity to cure possible defects in proof which otherwise might make its case legally insufficient.\u201d  Id . at 1173 (emphasis in original).   \nJudgment as a matter of law may be entered against a non -moving party i f the Court \u201cfinds \nthat a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on [an] issue.\u201d  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 50(a)(1).  Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate \u201conly if, viewing \nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonab ly could find \nliability.\u201d  Lightning Lube , 4 F.3d at  1166.  Entry of judgment as a matter of law is a remedy to be 3 invoked only \u201csparingly.\u201d  CGB Occupational Therapy, Inc. v. RHA Health Servs. Inc., 357 F.3d \n375, 383 (3d Cir. 2004). \nFollowing a jury trial , a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) \nmay be granted only if the movant demonstrates \u201cthat the jury\u2019s findings, presumed or express, are not supported by substantial evidence or, if they were, that the legal conclusion(s) impl ied [by] \nthe jury\u2019s verdict cannot in law be supported by those findings.\u201d  Pannu v. Iolab Corp., 155 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence that a reaso nable mind might accept as adequate to support the \nfinding under review.  See Enplas Display Device Corp. v. Seoul Semiconductor Co., 909 F.3d \n398, 407 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  In determining whether substantial evidence supports the jury verdict, the Court may not make credibility determinations, weigh the evidence or substitute its own conclusions for that of the jury where the record evidence supports multiple inferences.  See  \nLightning Lube , 4 F.3d at 1166.  \nB. New Trial  \nRule 59(a) permits a district court judge , \u201con motion,\u201d to grant a new trial \u201cfor any reason \nfor which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court.\u201d \u201cNew trials are commonly granted in the following situations: (1) where the jury\u2019s verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, and a new trial must be granted to prevent a miscarriage of justice; \n(2) where newly -discovered evidence exists that would likely alter the outcome of the trial; \n(3) where improper conduct by an attorney or the court unfairly influence d the verdict; or (4)  where \nthe jury\u2019s verdict was facially inconsistent.\u201d  See Ateliers de la Haute- Garonne v. Broetje \nAutomation- USA Inc., 85 F. Supp. 3d 768, 775 (D. Del. 2015) (citing Zarow \u2013Smith v. N.J. Transit \nRail Operations , 953 F.Supp. 581, 584 (D .N.J.1997)).  4 Whether or not to grant a motion for new trial is within the court\u2019s discretion.  See, e.g., \nAllied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc ., 449 U.S. 33, 36 (1980) (\u201cThe authority to grant a new trial, \nmoreover, is confided almost entirely to the exercis e of discretion on the part of the trial court.\u201d).  \nThe Court, however, should not set the verdict aside as against the clear weight of the evidence \nsolely because it would have reached a different result as the trier of fact.  Rose Hall, Ltd. v. Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corp., 576 F. Supp. 107, 124 (D. Del. 1983).  To the contrary, a \njury\u2019s verdict should be set aside \u201conly if manifest injustice will otherwise result.\u201d  Consumer Powers Co. v. Curtiss \u2013Wright Corp., 780 F.2d 1093, 1097 (3d Cir. 1985) ; see also  Bullen v. \nChaffinch, 335 F.Supp.2d 342, 347 (D. Del. 2004) (stating a court should consider whether \u201ca new trial must be granted to prevent a miscarriage of justice.\u201d).  \u201cAlthough the standard for grant of a new trial is less rigorous than the s tandard for grant of judgment as a matter of law \u2013 in that the \nCourt need not view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner \u2013 a new trial \nshould only be granted where \u2018a miscarriage of justice would result if the verdict were to stand,\u2019 \nthe verdict \u2018cries out to be overturned,\u2019 or where the verdict \u2018shocks [the] conscience.\u2019\u201d  Ateliers , \n86 F. Supp. 3d at 776 (citing Williamson v. Consol. Rail Corp., 926 F.2d 1344, 1352- 53 \n(3d Cir. 1991)).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThe Court now  consider s the issues raised by Defendant\u2019s motion.  First, the Court will \nanalyze whether the jury had a sufficient evidentiary basis for finding for the Plaintiff on Count II.  \nSecond, the Court will determine  whether Defendant properly preserved his  argument that Count \nII is time -barred.  Last, the Court will consider whether Counts III, IV, V, and VI are time -barred.  \nBecause the Court resolves each of the above questions in Plaintiff\u2019s favor, Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial wil l be denied.  5 A. The Jury Had a Sufficient Evidentiary Basis for Finding in Plaintiff\u2019s  \nFavor on Count II          \nCount II alleges Sexual Abuse of a Minor under Delaware Law.  To establish liability for \nCount II, Plaintiff had  the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, each of the \nelements of any  one of several statutes:  (a) incest under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 766; (b) sexual extortion \nunder 11 Del. C. \u00a7 774; (c) continuous sexual abuse of a child under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 776; (d) indecent \nexposure under 11 De l. C. \u00a7 765;  or (e) offensive touching under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 601.  The jury found \nthat Plaintiff had established her burden under each  of the Delaware statutes at issue.   \nThe Court agrees that that there was substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that \nthe elements of at least one of the underlying statutes were met.  For example, to establish that Defendant committed indecent exposure under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 765, Plaintiff had to prove that Defendant exposed his genitals or buttocks to Plaintiff  in Delaware, when she was less than 16 \nyears of age; and Defendant knew or was aware his conduct was likely to cause Plaintiff affront or alarm.  Here, Plaintiff testified that between the ages of three and five years old, her father would force her to ta ke baths with him at their home in Delaware, and she described the games, \nincluding \u201cRow, Row, Row Your Boat\u201d and \u201cMilking the Snake\u201d that she had to play in the bathtub that involved manual and oral stimulation of her father\u2019s genitals.  (Tr. 84:4 \u201385:5 ).  She testified \nthat her father had locked the door during the baths, and that the baths ended after her mother unlocked the door with a screwdriver during one bath and then began to supervise bathing.  ( Id.).  \nPlaintiff testified tha t, after returning from  Delaware,  her father assaulted her  weekly, and that  \u201cthe \nabuse occu rred in my bedroom, in the basement, parking lots, movie theater, office complexes.\u201d  \n(Id. at 89:2\u20137).  Plaintiff also testified as to as features of her father\u2019s private anatomy ( id. at 9 1:9\u2013\n12) and described being given Benadryl before incidents of abuse, which caused her to become groggy and compliant  (id. at 89:14\u201320) .  Further , the jury heard testimony from Plaintiff\u2019s therapist 6 who testified that Plaintiff\u2019s complex chronic post -traumatic stress disorder began in her early \nchildhood.  ( Id. at 221:21 \u201322). \nDefendant asserts that this evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.  \nSpecifically, Defendant describes the verdict as being based on \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s vague and conclusory \nallegations\u201d and contradicted by other parts of the verdict where the jury found for Defendant on \nhuman trafficking counts.  (D.I. 177 at 19 -20).  But Defendant \u2019s argument is essentially asking the \nCourt to make a credibility determination, as his  own brief cites Plaintiff\u2019s testimony that her father \nrepeatedly abused her in Delaware.  ( Id. at 19).  Credibility, however, is for the jury to determine.   \nHere, the jury believed Plaintiff\u2019s account of abuse and it found for her on Count II.  C ourts \nhave long found that a victim\u2019s testimony alone is sufficient to support a criminal  rape conviction, \nsee, e.g., U.S. v. Howard , 218 F.3d 556, 565 (6th Cir. 2000) , which has a higher burden of proof \nthan the burden faced by Plaintiff in this case .  Accordingly, there is no doubt that  Plaintiff\u2019s \ntestimony supplied a sound evidentiary basis for a jury to find in her favor  on Count II.  That  \nDefendant prevailed on counts related to human trafficking says nothing about the sufficiency of the evidence underlying Count II.   \nThe jury had a sufficient evidentiary basis for finding that Defendant was liable for Count \nII, and the Court will not disturb it.  \nB. Defendant Failed to Preserve His Argument That Count II is Time -\nBarred           \nDefendant also argues t hat Count II is time -barred .  Defendant\u2019s argument , however, came \nextremely late in the proceedings.  At trial, Defendant expressly conceded that Count II is not time -\nbarred.  (Tr. at 337:20\u201322, \u201cThe other count -- that only leaves Count II, Count VIII, Count XIII, \nand Count XIV which we concede either has no statute of limitations or it has not yet expired.\u201d ; \nTr. at 381:13\u201314, \u201c . . . yesterday we did concede that Count II, VIII, XIII and XIV do not have 7 statute of limitations problems\u201d; T r. at 388:17\u201323 (s ame) ).  In Defendant\u2019s renewed motion for \njudgment as a matter of law, he asserted only that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s verdicts as to Counts III, IV, V, and \nVI should be vacated as a matter of law, as all four of these claims are time- barred by the applicable \nstatute of limitations.\u201d  (D.I. 176) .  Nowhere in his renewed motion did Defendant argue that Count \nII is time -barred.  Indeed, in his opening brief, Defendant seemed to accept that  Count II is not \ntime-barred.  (D.I. 177 at 15, \u201cAccordingly, here, Section 8145\u2019s unlimited statute of limitations \nonly applies to Plaintiff\u2019s Count II  . . .\u201d) .  Defendant , however, changed his position in his reply \nbrief  and argued for the first time that Count II was also time -barred by the applicable statute of \nlimitations.  ( D.I. 181 at 7).   \nThe Court finds that Defendant \u2019s untimely argument that Count II is time -barred  is waived  \nand will not be entertained  for two reasons .  First, Defendant never argued that Count II is time -\nbarred when he made his motion for a judgment as a  matter of law at trial, and so he cannot renew \nthis argument as Rule 50(b) requires .  Additionally , Defendant  waived this argument by first \nmaking it in his reply brief, not his opening brief.  \nA Rule 50(b) motion is a renewed motion for judgment as a mat ter of law, and may raise \nonly grounds asserted in the motion for a directed verdict.  Orlando v. Billcon Int \u2019l, Inc., 822 F.2d \n1294, 1298 (3d Cir. 1987).  When Defendant made his Rule 50(a) motion, he did not claim that \nCount II is time -barred.  On the contrary, Defendant explicitly conceded that \u201cCount 2 . . . either \nhas no statute of limitations or it has not yet expired.\u201d  (Tr. 337:20\u201322; 381:13\u201314; 388:17\u201323).  Because Defendant did not make a Rule 50(a) motion that Count II is time -barred , he cannot  \nDefendant cannot \u201crenew\u201d the at the Rule 50(b) stage.  \nMoreover, in his opening brief in support of his renewed motion for judgment as a matter \nof law, Defendant raised a statute of limitations defense for Counts III, IV, V, and VI, but not f or 8 Count II.  (D.I. 177) .  Indeed, that brief  concedes that Count II is not tim e-barred by stating that \n10 Del. C. \u00a7 8145\u2019s \u201cunlimited statute of limitations  only applies to Plaintiff\u2019s Count II.\u201d  (D.I.  177 \nat 15).  Defendant\u2019s opening position was consistent with his position through trial \u2013 Count II is \nnot time -barred.   Defendant\u2019 s position only changed in his reply brief, where he first argued that \nCount II is time -barred .  (D.I. 181 at 6\u201310).  A reply brief, however, is not the appropriate time to \nraise a new argument.  See Laborers \u2019 Int\u2019l Union of N. Am. v. Foster Wheeler Corp., 26 F.3d 375, \n398 (3d Cir. 1994)  (\u201cAn issue is waived unless a party raises it in its opening brief . . .\u201d); Hayes v. \nSilvers, Langsam & Weitzman, P.C., 441 F. Supp. 3d 62, 67 n.4 (E.D.  Pa. 2020)  (\u201c[T]he Court \ndeclines to consider arguments raised for the f irst time in a Reply brief . . .\u201d);  In re BlackRock Mut. \nFunds Advisory Fee Litig., 327 F. Supp.3d 690, 736 n.42 (D.N.J. 2018) ( explaining that \u201cc ourts \nordinarily decline to consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief . . .\u201d) .  Defendant \nhad a full and fair opportunity to argue that Count II was time -barred  in his opening brief.  He did \nnot do so and thus waived the argument .  Therefore, for this distinct and independent reason, t he \nCourt will not consider Defendant\u2019s  argument  that Count II is time -barred . \nC. Counts III\u2013VI Are Not Time- Barred  \nDefendant further argues that Counts III \u2013VI are time- barred.  The parties disagree as to \nwhether the issue was waived and whether  the claims are time -barred under Delaware law.  The \nCourt wil l address each issue in turn. \n1) The Argument Was N ot Waived  \nPlaintiff contends  that Defendant  waived his  argument  that Counts III \u2013VI are time -barred \nby failing to submit  the argument to the jury or to the Court as a question of law in the Joint Pretrial \nOrder.  (D.I. 180 at 2\u20133).  Defendant , of course, disagrees, pointing out that he raised this argument 9 throughout the litigation  and that Plaintiff specifically responded to i t throughout trial without \nasserting that the issue was waived .  (D.I. 177 at 8 \u20139).   \nThe Court agrees  with Defendant .  Affirmative defenses, which include the statute of \nlimitations, \u201cmust generally be raised as early as reasona bly possible\u201d but  will generally not be \nwaived so long as they are \u201craised at a \u2018pragmatically sufficient time\u2019 with no prejudice to the \nplaintiff.\u201d  Gleeson v. Prevoznik, 253 F. App\u2019 x 176, 179 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation and \ncitation omitted); Staf ford v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours , 27 F. App\u2019 x 137, 140 (3d Cir. 2002) \n(citation omitted).  Defendant raised this defense in his Answer to Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint and First Amended Complaint.  (D.I. 7 at 19; D.I. 34 at 26).  Defendant  maintained  the very same argument \nin his motion for judgment as a matter of law (Tr.  333:17\u2013338:8) and, at the charge conference,  \nthe parties agreed that this issue would be for the Court to decide  as a question of law .  (Id. at \n655:5\u2013656: 13).  Finding that Defendant properly raised the affirmative defense, that the parties \nagreed that the Court would decide whether the claims at issue are barred as a matter of law, and \nthat Plaintiff suffers no prejudice in having the Court address  this issue at this stage of the \nproceedings, the C ourt finds no waiver .   \n2) Counts III \u2013VI are Not Time -Barred  As A Matter of Law  \nThe Court will now determine whether Counts III \u2013VI are time -barred as a matter of law.  \nFirst, the  Court will analyze which statute of limitations applies.  Next, the Court will apply that \nstatute to the present dispute.  \nThe parties disagree as to the applicable statute  of limitations.  Defendant insists that \n10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119\u2019s two- year statute of limitations applies,  and Plaintiff  insists that 10 Del. C. \n\u00a7 8145\u2019s unlimited statute of limitations  governs.  (D.I. 177 at 11\u201316; D.I. 180 at 4\u20136) .  Neither \nparty\u2019s argument is without some support  \u2013 \u00a7 8119 sets a statute of limitations for \u201c a claim for 10 alleged personal injuries \u201d and \u00a7 8145 applies to \u201c[a] cause of action based upon the sexual abuse \nof a minor  by an adult .\u201d  To decide which statute applies , the Court is guided by the long- standing \ncanon of statutory interpretation that \u201ca  specific provision controls one[s] of more general \napplication .\u201d  Bloate v. United States , 559 U.S. 196, 207 (2010); Morales v. Trans World Airlines, \nInc., 504 U.S. 374, 384 (1992).  Here, \u00a7 8145 deals with \u201c sexual abuse of a minor  by an adult\u201d and \n\u00a7 8119 concerns \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d of a general type.  Section 8145, the more specific statute, \ngoverns.  This is consistent with the approach taken by Delaware courts .  See, e.g., Sokolove v. \nMarenberg, No. CV S13C -08-022 RFS, 2013 WL 6920791, at *2 (Del. Supe r. Ct. Dec. 5, 2013)  \n(applying \u00a7 8145 to negligent infliction of emotional harm, reckless infliction of emotional harm, \nand false imprisonment claims  in a case dealing with alleged sexual abuse of a child ). \nSection 8145\u2019s application to Counts III \u2013IV do es not, however, summarily  resolve whether \nthe claims in question are time -barred.  The relevant sections of \u00a7 8145 are reproduced below:  \n(a) A cause of action based upon the sexual abuse of a minor by an \nadult may be filed in the Superior Court of this State  at any time \nfollowing the commission of the act or acts that constituted the sexual abuse. A civil cause of action for sexual abuse of a minor shall be based upon sexual acts that would constitute a criminal offense under the Delaware Code.  \n (b) For a period of 2 years following July 9, 2007, victims of child sexual abuse that occurred in this State who have been barred from filing suit against their abusers by virtue of the expiration of the former civil statute of limitations, shall be permitted to file those claims in the Superior Court of this State.  \n \nSubsection (a) creates an unlimited statute of limitations for \u201csexual abuse of a minor . . . based \nupon sexual acts that would constitute a criminal offense under the Delaware Code.\u201d  S ubsection \n(b), however, makes clear that subsection (a)\u2019s  unlimited limitation period is not wholly \nretroactive, as it created a two -year revival period for previously barred claims.  Therefore , those \nclaims that were time -barred prior to July 10, 2007 were permitted to be revived  until July 9, 2009  11 only.  And those claims \u201cbased upon the sexual abuse of a minor by an adult\u201d that were not stale \non July 9, 2007 could be raised at any time.  See id. at *5 (explaining that any claim that is not \nstale on July 9, 2007 would be \u201csaved . . . forever\u201d by \u00a7 8145). \n Therefore, the question is whether Counts III \u2013IV were barred on July 9, 2007 , and therefore \ntime-barred by the ti me she filed suit in 2019.  Defendant argues that \u201c Section 8145 only applies \nto cases when the alleged sexual abuse occurred either  (1) on or after Section 8145 was enacted in \n2007; or (2) prior to 2007 and the claimant filed suit.\u201d  (D.I.181 at 6\u20137).  Def endant contends that \nthe present dispute falls outside of \u00a7 8145\u2019s statute of limitations because Plaintiff\u2019s claim is based \non sexual abuse that occurred between 1983 and 1992, she reported an instance of sexual abuse to her mother during that timeframe but brought suit decades later .  Plaintiff re sponds that her \nmemories came back to her over time in around the timeframe she  brought the suit and that \u00a7 8145 \napplies because of Delaware\u2019s discovery rul e. \nThe Court  agrees with Plaintiff.  Delaware courts apply the discovery rule for an \n\u201cinherently unknowable injury\u201d sustained by a plaintiff \u201cblamelessly ignorant of the act or omission and injury complained of, and the harmful effect  thereof develops gradually over a period \nof time [.]\u201d  Eden v. Oblates of St. Francis de Sales , No. 04C -01-069 CLS, 2006 WL 3512482, at \n*4 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 4, 2006)  (citing Layton v. Allen, 246 A.2d 794, 798 (Del.1968)).   Delaware \ncourts have recogniz ed the applicability of this rule in tolling  the statute of limitations where an \nindividua l alleged that their  memory of being sexually abused as a child was repressed .  See id.; \nKeller v. Maccubbin , No. CI V.A. K11C -03015RBY, 2012 WL 1980417, at *4 (Del. S uper. Ct. \nMay 16, 2012) .  In Eden , for example, the court held that the plaintiff was time -barred from \nbringing a claim related to an instance of abuse that he reported, but was not time -barred from \nbringing claims related to the 900 instances of abuse he suffered before the reported claim  because 12 there was sufficient evidence in the record indicating that the plaintiff suffered from traumatic \namnesia (a condition impacting memory).  \nThus, the Court cannot find that Plaintiff was time -barred from bringing Counts III\u2013V I as \na matter of law .  Plaintiff alleged that her memories were repressed until 2 018.  Based on the \ncourts\u2019  analys es in Eden  and Keller , a plaintiff\u2019s repressed memory can toll \u00a7 8119.  Because \nPlaintiff submitted sufficient  evidence that she regained her memory well after \u00a7 8145(a)\u2019s \nunlimited statute of limitations replaced \u00a7 8119 for victims of  child sexual abuse , the Court cannot \nfind that Plaintiff was time -barred from bringing her claims as a matter of law.   Whether her \nmemories truly were repressed would be a question of fact for the jury to decide, but Defendant chose not to submit that que stion to the jury.  Because there was sufficient evidence in the record \nfor the jury to find that Plaintiff\u2019s memories were repressed until around the time she filed suit, the Court does not find that Counts III \u2013IV are time -barred as a matter of law, and t he jury\u2019s verdict \nwill stand.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, Defendant\u2019s renewed motions  for judgment as a matter of law and \na new trial are DENIED.
