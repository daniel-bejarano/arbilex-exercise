With great  \npower comes great responsibility. Because the controlling shareholder  has access to \ncompany information that minority shareholders do not , it must  keep them  in the \nloop. And it  may not exploit  its insider position to buy out the minority shareholders \nat a discount.  \nYet here, minority shareholders in 704Games say the controlling shareholder, Mo-\ntorsport , did just that. It  led them to believe the company was in dire straits , then \nfailed to correct that impression when new informatio n suggested other wise. If true, \nthat counts as securities fraud. So I will not dismiss the ir claim.  \nThe shareholders  tack on other securities c laims against Motorsport and its exec-\nutives  too, plus breach of fiduciary  duty and unjust  enrichment. Those allegations  \narise from the same facts and are also plausible, so I will not dismiss them either .  \nI. BACKGROUND  \n704Games is a videogame developer, best  known for making the  \nNASCAR Heat series  of racing games . D.I. 14 \u00b6  6. But this case is about  boardroom \ncompetition, not virtual car race s. \nIn mid -2020, 704Games\u2019 controlling shareholder, Motorsport Games Inc., offered \nto buy out minority shareholders HC2 Holdings 2, Inc ., Continental General Insur-\nance Company, and Leo Capital Holdings. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 17\u201318. Its bid succeeded . In August, \nHC2 and Continental signed a Stock Purchase Agreement with Motorsport, selling 3 their stake s in 704Games for  $11.29 per share. Id. \u00b6 20. Leo followed suit  in October , \nsigning a nearly identical agreement. Id.  \u00b6 21.  \nBut the minority shareholders soon came to regret th at sale. In January 2021, \nMotorsport, which now wholly owned 704Games , went public. Id.  \u00b6 22. Its initial pub-\nlic offering was a roaring success. During the first day\u2019s trading, shares in Motorsport \nhit $38. Id.  \u00b6 26.  \nThat success, the shareholders allege, reflected the true value of 704Games. They \npoint out that Motorsport was essentially a holding c ompany for 704Games. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 10, \n13, 59. Indeed, t he NASCAR Heat series , 704Games \u2019s key product, \u201caccounted for \u2026 \n99% of [Motorsport\u2019s] total net revenue\u201d the year before the company went public. Id.  \n\u00b6 22. Plus, Motorsport\u2019s IPO documents  advertised that the \u201cfranchise [would] con-\ntinue to account for the majority of [Motorsport\u2019s]  revenue .\u201d Id. \nBecaus e 704Games drove the value of Motorsport\u2019s  IPO,  the shareholders say , \nthey should have been able to share  in that success. But Motorsport denied them that \nchance.  They claim that it leveraged its position as 704Games\u2019 s controlling share-\nholder to dupe them into selling their shares at a knockdown  price. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 15. To \nsupport that theory, they point to what Motorsport told them and what it hid from \nthem .  \nThe shareholders  say that Motorsport spent a year presenting a gloomy forecast \nfor 704Games . In board meetings and budgets, it  \u201cportray[ed] [704Games] as a \nmoney -losing entity that was likely to require additional capital infusions from its \ninvestors with little hope of near -term profitability.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 75, 80 .  4 Plus, in June 2020, Motorsport\u2019s CEO told the shareholders that  there was \u201cbad  \u2026 \nsentiment\u201d about 704Games\u2019s forthcoming game , NASCAR Heat 5. Id.  \u00b6 103. He went \non to say that \u201cpre -sales [of the game] [were] struggling\u201d and claimed that 704Games \nwould \u201crun out of money \u2026 even if [ it] hit [its] current projections.\u201d Id.  (emphasis \nomitted). Confirming that impression, Motorsport projected a  cash shortfall of almost \n$1.2 million.  Id. \u00b6 108. As a result, Motorsport said that to stay afloat,  704Games  \nwould likely need  additional investment soon. Id. \u00b6 125.  \nYet this grim  forecast  was not borne out. I n July 2020, NASCAR Heat 5 was re-\nleased with strong sales : in fact, d emand for that game \u201csignificantly exceeded sales \nof [740Games\u2019s]  prior NASCAR Heat games.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 132. But even though the strong \nsales boosted the company\u2019s finances, Motorsport did not \u201cshare th[at] good news with \n[the minority shareholders] .\u201d Id.  \nThe shareholders also claim that Motorsport hid the truth about its IPO  from \nthem . Though Motorsport told them it planned to go public in the future, it failed to \ndisclose that its  IPO was \u201calready in pro cess and that the valuation of Motorsport \nwould be ba sed almost entirely on the value of [704Games].\u201d Id. \u00b6 154.  \nLast, the shareholders say that Motorsport usurped  corporate opportunities that \nrightfully belonged to 704Games . Motorsport entered into a promotion agreement \nwith a celebrity driver : two-time Formula One World Champion Fernando Alonso. Id. \n\u00b6 133. And it began negotiations to get  exclusive permission  to make  games based on  \nother high -profile races  like the FIA World Endurance Championship and the 24 \nHours of Le Mans. Id. \u00b6 140. 5 Outraged by Motorsport\u2019s maneuvers , the minority shareholders sued Motorsport \nand four of its executives: Mike Zoi, Jonathan New, Dmitry Kozko, and Alex Rothbert. \nThey sue under the Securities Exchange Act  of 1934, and also  claim for breach  of \ncontract, breach  of fiduciary  duty,  fraud,  and unjust  enrichment.  \nNow  the defendants move to dismiss.  D.I. 17.  To survive, the shareholders\u2019 com-\nplaint must contain enough facts to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  \nII. THE SHAREHOLDERS \u2019 \u00a7 10(b ) SECURITIES CLAIMS MAY PROCEED  \nTo state a claim for securities fraud under \u00a7  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act  \nof 1934, the shareholders must plead that:  \n\u2022 Motorsport made a \u201cmaterial misrepresentation or omission\u201d;  \n\u2022 intentionally or recklessly;  \n\u2022 in connection with the sale of 704Games stock;  \n\u2022 and that in reliance, the shareholders suffered economic loss.  \nStoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Sci. -Atlanta , 552 U.S. 148, 157 (2008) ; 15 U.S. C. \n\u00a7 78j; 17 C .F.R. \u00a7 240.10b- 5. Plus, securities -fraud claims have a heightened pleading \nstandard. So the shareholders must \u201cspecify each allegedly misleading statement \n[and explain] why the statement was misleading.\u201d Institutional Invs. Grp. v. Avaya, \nInc., 564 F.3d 242, 251 (3d Cir. 2009) ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  78u-4(b)(1).  And they  must give \nfacts raising \u201ca strong inference that [Motorsport] acted with the required state of \nmind.\u201d Id. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2)(A).  6 Motorsport does not contest that the alleged misrepresentations concerned the \nsale of 704Games stock. Instead, it  asserts  that the shareholders failed to check  the \nother  three boxes . But those  arguments fail. The shareholders state a claim.  \nA.  Material misrepresentations or omissions \nUnpacking the shareholders \u2019 securities -fraud claim shows that it rests on two dif-\nferent alleged deceptions :  \n\u2022 Motorspor t\u2019s failure to tell the shareholders that it had immediate plans to \ngo public after its acquisition of 704Games. D.I. 14  \u00b6\u00b6 74\u2212147  \n\u2022 Motorsport\u2019s  presenting  a gloomy forecast about 704Games future and then \nfailing  to tell shareholders that NASCAR Heat 5 was a success. Id.  \nTake each theory in turn. The first alleged deception is undercut by facts in the \nshareholders \u2019 complaint.  They cannot complain that Motorsport failed to disclose its \nplans to go public because it  did tell them. When they sold their stock, the sharehold-\ners signed an agreement acknowledging  that they \u201c ha[d] sufficient knowledge \u2026 \nabout [Motorsport\u2019s] \u2026 current efforts to consummate a liquidity event or an initial \npublic offering  \u2026 as soon as practicable.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 182, 196.  But now, they sing a differ-\nent tune: they say the IPO disclosures were not specific enough because Motorsport \ndid not expressly say that it was already planning to go public. D.I. 20, at 9\u221210. This \nnew argument i s plainly inconsistent with (and undercut by) the earlier acknowledg-\nment . D.I. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 182, 196.  \nYet all is not lost ; the shareholders \u2019 second theory is viable.  True, many of Motor-\nsport\u2019s statements were predictions about 704Games\u2019 future performance. And such 7 forward -looking statements are actionable only if Motorsport knew that they were \nfalse when it made them. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  78u-5(c)(1) (B)(ii), (i)(1)(A). But wh ere later de-\nvelopments make such predictive statements \u201cmisleading if left unrevised,\u201d a major-\nity shareholder has a \u201cduty \u2026 to correct [them].\u201d In re Phillips Petroleum Sec. Litig ., \n881 F.2d 1236, 1245 (3d Cir. 1989) ; see also Steiner v. MedQuist Inc., 2006 WL \n2827740, at *15 (D.N.J. Sept. 29, 2006) (\u201c[C]orporate officers \u2026 are required to \nmake  \u2026 additional disclosures \u2026 necessary to avoid rendering [prior] statements \u2026 \nmisleading.\u201d) . \nThat is what happened here. The shareholders allege that after Motorsport made \ngrim predictions about the company \u2019s future , it learned that NASCAR Heat 5 , the \ncompany\u2019s major new product , had \u201cexceeded sales of the company\u2019s prior NASCAR \nHeat games.\u201d D.I. 14 \u00b6 132. That placed 704Games in a \u201cmuch better financial posi-\ntion than \u2026 [Motorsport]  had indicated.\u201d Id. Indeed, Motorsport later attributed its \nstrong 2020 performance to \u201cthe release of [the game] .\u201d Id. \u00b6 128. Yet it never told  the \nminority shareholders. If true, that counts as a material omission.  \nB. Intentionally or recklessly  \nTo check this box, the shareholders must allege facts that make it as likely as not \nthat Motorsport acted intentionally or recklessly. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & \nRights, Ltd ., 551 U.S. 308, 328  (2007). Though they do not need  \u201csmoking -gun\u201d evi-\ndence, the inference must be \u201ccogent and compelling.\u201d Id. at 324.   Here, Motorsport\u2019s \nmotive to defraud the shareholders into selling their shares below market va lue is \ncompelling evidence of the required mental state. Rahman v. Kid Brands, Inc ., 736 \nF.3d 237, 245 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c [P]lead[ing] motive \u2026 can be persuasive.\u201d).  8 As the shareholders note, \u201c[t]he launch of Heat 5 was by far the most important \noperational event for 704Games.\u201d D.I. 20, at 18. So Motorsports\u2019 key executives  would \nhave known about its strong sales. See, e.g. , De Vito v. Liquid Holdings Grp., Inc., \n2018 WL 6891832, at *36 (D.N.J. Dec. 31, 2018) ( finding issues that \u201cstr[ike] at the \nheart of [a company\u2019s] core business and operations\u201d  probative of knowledge). And \nthe executives\u2019 knowledge may be attributed to Motorsport. See, e.g. , SEC v. Graulich , \n2013 WL 3146862, at *6 (D.N.J. June 19, 2013) ( allowing senior executives\u2019 \nknowledge to be attri buted to company).  \nThe executives also had a motive to mislead the shareholders about Heat 5\u2019s suc-\ncess. They could buy  704Games at a discount , have more  cash on hand at the IPO , \nand thus look more attractive to  investors . In re Shanda Games Ltd. Sec. Liti g., 2019 \nWL 11027710, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2019) ( finding \u201cmotive and opportunity to \nsecure a low transaction price\u201d enough to show intent or recklessness).  Plus, they \nstood to benefit personally: the more successful the IPO, the bigger  the payday. See \nD.I. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 84\u221285 (noting that one executive\u2019s compensation was linked to the success \nof the IPO); Rahman , 736 F.3d at 245\u2013 46 (recognizing \u201cconcrete \u2026 benefit to the in-\ndividual defendants\u201d as motive evidence (quoting Avaya, 564 F.3d at  278)). Thus, the \nshareholders adequately plead that Motorsport and its executives intentionally or \nrecklessly misled them.  \nC. Reliance and loss  \n1. Reliance . When a securities -fraud plaintiff is  misled by an omission, \u201creliance \nwill be presumed from the materiality of the information not disclosed.\u201d Johns ton v. \nHBO Film Mgmt ., Inc., 265 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing Affiliated Ute Citizens 9 v. United States , 406 U.S. 128, 153\u2013 54 (1972)).  Here, the shareholders \u2019 claim is based \non an omission : they say Motorsport should have, but did not, tell them about  Heat \n5\u2019s success.  That was an omission of a material fact, so I will presume reliance here. \nId.  \n2. Loss. The shareholders  also plead that they suffered a loss. They say  the market \nvalue of 704Games\u2019  stock was higher than the amount they got. D.I. 14 \u00b6 198. To \nsupport that, they point to the success of Motorsport\u2019s IPO. True, Motorsport may \nultimately undermine that causation theo ry by explaining why Motorsport\u2019s valua-\ntion does not reflect 704Games\u2019s value. But I may not resolve that factual dispute on \nthis motion to dismiss.  \nIII. THE SHAREHOLDERS \u2019 INSIDER -TRADING AND  \nCONTROL -PERSON CLAIMS MAY PROCEED  \nIn addition to their securities -fraud claims, the shareholders bring claims under \nthe Securities Act of 1934: an insider -trading claim against Motorsport and control -\nperson claims against Zoi, Kozko, and New.  \nThe defendants make just one argument for  dismissing  those claims. They point \nout that both claims require a predicate violation of the Exchange Act , yet here, they \nsay, the shareholders have not pleaded that violation. D.I. 18, at 19; see also In re \nCendant Corp. Litig., 60 F. Supp. 2d 354, 378 \u201379 (D.N.J. 1999) (listing requirements \nfor both \u00a7  20A and \u00a7  20(a)  claims). Not so. As I have explained, the shareholders have \nplausible securities -fraud claims against the defendants. And that counts as a predi-\ncate violation. Id.  at 378 (noting that \u00a7  10(b) claims count as predicate violations).  10 Because the defendants do not contest the other elements of the shareholder s\u2019 in-\nsider -trading and control -person claims, those claims  may go on .  \nIV. THE SHAREHOLDERS \u2019 COMMON -LAW CLAIMS MAY PROCEED  \nThe shareholders also bring common -law claims against the defendants. They al-\nlege that the Motorsport breached its 704Games Stockholders \u2019 Agreement by failing \nto make proper  financial disclosures. Plus, they say , all the defendants violated their \nfiduciary duties to the shareholders. Last , they contend that the defendants were un-\njustly enriched by their fraudulent scheme.  \nParrying those allegations, the defendants  argue that the common -law claims are \nbarred by the  general release that  the shareholders signed when they sold their stock. \nAnd even if that release does not bar the shareholders\u2019 claims,  the defendants say,  \neach claim fails  on its merits. Both responses miss the mark . \nA. The release does not bar the shareho lders claims  \nStart with the text of the release : \n[The shareholders release] any and all claims, debts , obligations, and \nliabilities, whether known or unknown, contingent or noncontingent, at \nlaw or in equity, in each case  directly or indirectly  arising from or in \nconnection with, or relating to, [704Games], [its] business, the Shares or \nany agreements or obligations of [704Games] and/or [Motorsport\u2019s] own-\nership [of it].  \nD.I. 14 -1, Ex. 2  \u00a7 9 (HC2 and Continental release); D .I. 14 -1, Ex. 3  \u00a7 9 (same release \nin Leo contract).  \nOn its face, that provision is broad enough to bar all the shareholders\u2019 common-\nlaw claims. But here\u2019s the rub: the shareholders say the release, which is part of the 11 contract selling their stock to Motorsport, was fraudulently induced. D.I. 14 \n\u00b6\u00b6 290\u2212301.  \nThat argument is persuasive. The shareholders say they would not have sold their  \nstock had Motorsport and its executives not misled them. Id.  \u00b6 301. And whe n a gen-\neral release is itself  fraudulently ind uced, the \u201cparty alleging fraud \u2026 may elect re-\nscission,\u201d setting aside that release. E .I. Dupont de Nemours & Co. v. Fla.  Evergreen \nFoliage , 744 A.2d 457, 465  (Del. 1999).  \nTrue, parties may execute general releases that \u201cextinguish claims for \u2026 fraud in \nthe inducement.\u201d Seven Invs. LLC v. AD Cap., LLC, 32 A.3d 391, 399 (Del. Ch. 2011). \nBut they did not do that here.  \nFor one, they did not expressly mention fraudulent inducem ent in the text of the \nrelease. Indeed, the alleged fraudulent inducement is \u201c\u2018different sequentially and \nconceptually \u2019 from the \u2026 subject of the [release].\u201d  Id. at 400 (quoting Seven Invs. , 32 \nA.3d at 462).  The contract released claims \u201crelating to [704Games ], [its] business\u201d \nand \u201c[Motorsport\u2019s] ownership [of it].\u201d D.I. 14 -1, Ex. 2  \u00a7 9; D.I. 14 -1, Ex. 3  \u00a7 9. Put \ndifferently , it relieve d Motorsport from liability flowing from its management of the \ncompany. Yet the shareholders \u2019 fraudulent -inducement cl aim goes to the sale of stock , \nnot management of the company . Besides , unlike other cases in which courts are will-\ning to read releases to preclude fraudulent -inducement claims, here there is no hint  \nthat the shareholders were \u201con notice of potential fraud. \u201d Seven Inves. , 32 A.3d at 399.  \nBecause the  shareholders plausibly plead that the release was fraudulently in-\nduced, I may look past it and consider the merits of their common -law claims.  12 B. The shareholders\u2019  claims survive on the merits \n1. Breach of contract.  Motorsport does not contest the shareholders\u2019 claim that it \nbreached the 704Games Stockholders \u2019 Agreement by failing to make proper financial \ndisclosures. Instead, it points out that the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement has a forum - \nselection clause directing disputes to federal district court in Florida. D.I. 14,  Ex. 1 \n\u00a7 13.8.   \nPushing back, the shareholders point to a competing forum- selection clause in the \nparties\u2019 Stock Purchase Agreement. That one sends disputes to this Court. See  D.I. \n14-1, Ex. 2  \u00a7 17; D.I. 14 -1, Ex. 3  \u00a7 17. But the shareholders may not have their cake \nand eat it too. They cannot say that the Stock Purchase  Agreement was fraudulently \ninduced and avoidable, but also claim that agreement validly  overrides their earlier \nforum -selection clause.  D.I. 20, at 24 n.13.  \nStill, I may overlook a forum -selection clause where judicial economy requires it.  \nI may do so if \u201cthe strong public interest in upholding the contracting parties\u2019 settled \nexpectations is \u2018overwhelmingly\u2019 outweighed by the countervailing interests.\u201d In re \nHowm edica Ostenoics Corp.,  867 F.3d 390, 405 (3d Cir. 2017)  (quoting Atl. Marine \nConst. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for W. Dist. of Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 67 (2013) ). This is that \nrare case.  \nHere, the parties\u2019 settled expectation in enforcing their forum -selection clau se is \nless compelling because they later elected  to send related disputes to this Court. D.I. \n14-1, Ex. 2 \u00a7  17; D.I. 14- 1, Ex. 3 \u00a7  17. And the countervailing interests greatly out-\nweigh that diminished expectation. If I were to send the shareholders\u2019 contract claim to Florida, that court would have to do duplicative factfinding: the shareholders\u2019 13 breach- of-contract and securities -fraud claims involve the same conduct by the de-\nfendants. Plus, that court would have to consider the same fraudulent -inducement \nargument that I have before me here, raising the possibility of contradictory rulings.  \nI thus look past the Florida forum -selection clause and let the contract claim pro-\nceed here. See In re Howmedica, 867 F.3d at 405.  \n2. Breach of fiduciary duty . A controlling shareholder owes fiduciary duties to mi-\nnority shareholders. See, e.g. , Valente v. Pepsico , Inc. , 68 F.R.D. 361, 364 ( D. Del. \n1975). It may not \u201cmislead [ a minority] stockholder by use of corporate information \nto which the latter is not privy.\u201d Weinberger v. UOP, Inc. , 457 A.2d 701, 711 (Del. \n1983). Nor may it  steal corporate  opportunities that rightfully belong to the company.  \nBroz v. Cellular Info. Sys., Inc. , 673 A.2d 148, 154 \u201355 (Del. 1996) .  \nYet Motorsport allegedly did both. It left the shareholders with the impression \nthat 704Games was in rough shape, then failed to correct that impression once it \nlearned that Heat 5 was a success. D.I. 14 \u00b6  132. And it took 704Games\u2019s opportuni-\nties by signing an endorsement deal with Fernando A lonso and negotiating  to develop \na new series of racing games.  Id. \u00b6 133. If true, those facts suggest that Motorsport \nbreached its  fiduciary duty. So t his claim survives too.  \n3. Unjust enrichment . To raise a claim that the defendants were unjustly enriched, \nthe shareholders must plead that they \u201cret[ained] \u2026 a benefit to the loss of [the share-\nholders],\u201d without justification. Tolliver v. Christina Sch. Dist ., 564 F. Supp. 2d 312, \n315 (D. Del. 2008).  14 Again, Motorsport does not contest that the share holders state a  claim on the mer-\nits. Rather, it says that claim is barred because it \u201carises from a relationship governed \nby contract\u201d\u2014here the parties\u2019 Stock Purchase Agreement. D.I. 18, at 24 (quoting Air Prods . & Chem ., Inc. v. Wies emann , 237 F. Supp. 3d, 192, 216 (D. Del. 2017) ). True \nenough.  But here , the shareholders plausibly plead  that the Stock Purchase Agree-\nment was fraudulently induced. And where \u201cthere is doubt surrounding the enforce-\nability \u2026 of a contract,\u201d unjust -enrichment claims may proceed . Albert v. Alex . Brown \nMgmt. Servs., Inc., 2005 WL 2130607, at *8 (Del. Ch. Aug. 26, 2005).  \n* * * * * \nA controlling shareholder may not use its insider knowledge to mislead minority \nshareholders, particularly when it enters a self -interested transaction to buy their \nstock. Ye t Motorsport allegedly did just that. So I will let the minority shareholders \u2019 \nsecurities -fraud claim proceed. Plus, the shareholders allege plausible insider -trad-\ning, control -person , breach -of-contract, breach -of-fiduciary -duty, and unjust -enrich-\nment claims . So I decline Motorsport\u2019s invitation to dismiss them .  "}
