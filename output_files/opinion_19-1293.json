LTD., \nHOMELITE CONSUMER PRODUCTS , \nINC., \nDefendants . Civil Action No. 19-1293-GBW \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington , Delaware this 26th day of October 2022. \nHaving reviewed the parties' letter briefing and other materials filed with respect \nto Plaintiffs Cherven (HK) Limited and Cherven North America, Inc.' s (collectively , \n\"Cherven\") motion to strike Defendants One World Technologies , Inc., Techtronic \nIndustries Co. Ltd., and Homelite Consumer Products, Inc.' s (collectively , \"Defendants \") \nNinth Affirmative Defense of Inequitable Conduct (D.I. 246; D.I. 247; D.I. 251; D.I. 253), \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Chervon's Motion to Strike Defendants ' Inequitable \nConduct Affirmative Defense (D.I. 246) is DENIED , for the reasons stated below. \nI. Background \nOn December 30, 2020, Defendants filed a Motion for Leave to Amend their \nAnswer and Affirmative Defenses to Chervon's Second Amended Complaint to add \"an \naffirmative defense that six of the nine asserted patents are unenforceable due to inequitable \nconduct.\" D.I. 134 at 1. Defendants allege that, during the prosecution of some of the \n1 asserted patents, the patent applicants and the prosecuting attorneys withheld a material \nfigure from a prior art publication with an intent to deceive the patent office. See generally \nD.I. 171 at ,r,r141-47 .1 On January 28, 2021, Magistrate Judge Fallon issued an Oral Order \ngranting Defendants' Motion to Leave to Amend their Answer and Affirmative Defenses. \nSee Jan. 28, 2021 Oral Order. On February 11, 2021, Chervon filed its objections to \nMagistrate Judge Fallon's January 28, 2021 Oral Order. See generally D.I. 191. On \nFebruary 25, 2021, Defendants responded to Chervon's rejections. See generally D.I. 197. \nThe Court overruled Chervon's objections. D.I. 250. \nOn December 8, 2021, Chervon filed its Motion to Strike Defendants ' Inequitable \nConduct Affirmative Defense. D.I. 246. \nII. Legal Standard \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), a court \"may strike from a \npleading an insufficient defense or any redundant , immaterial , impertinent , or scandalous \nmatter.\" \"The court may act: (1) on its own; or (2) on motion made by a party either before \nresponding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being served \nwith the pleading.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). Motions to strike are generally \"disfavored. \" \nSymbol Techs., Inc. v. Aruba Networks , Inc., 609 F. Supp. 2d 353, 356 (D. Del. Mar. 30, \n2009) (citing Seidel v. Lee, 954 F. Supp. 810,812 (D. Del. Dec. 30, 1996)). \"When ruling \non a motion to strike, the [ c ]ourt must construe all facts in favor of the nonmoving party \n1 In the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (\"PTAB\") preliminary institution decisions in the inter \npartes review of some of the asserted patents, the PT AB noted that the withheld figure in the prior \nart publication was \"particularly relevant.\" See D.I. 171, Ex. 1, IPR2020-00884 , Decision \nGranting Institution of Inter Partes Review (Paper No. 20) at 31; Ex. 2, IPR2020-00886 , Decision \nGranting Institution of Inter Partes Review (Paper No. 21) at 29; Ex. 3, IPR2020-00888, Decision \nGranting Institution of Inter Partes Review (Paper No. 20) at 25. In the PTAB's final written \ndecision opinion, the PTAB found the patents valid. D.I. 247 at l; D.I. 251 at 3. \n2 and deny the motion if the defense is sufficient under law.\" Symbol Techs., 609 F. Supp. \n2d at 356 ( quoting Procter & Gamble Co. v. Nabisco Brands, Inc., 697 F. Supp. 1360, 1362 \n(D. Del. Oct. 21, 1988)) (internal quotations omitted). \"[A] court should not grant a motion \nto strike a defense unless the insufficiency of the defense is 'clearly apparent.\"' Cipollone \nv. Liggett Grp., Inc., 789 F.2d 181, 188 (3d Cir. 1986), rev'd on other grounds, 505 U.S. \n504, 112 (1992) (citations omitted). \nIII. Discussion \nChervon's motion to strike is untimely under Rule 12(f)(2) and the Court declines \nto consider Chervon's motion to strike \"on its own\" under Rule 12(f)(l). Rule 12(f)(2) \nstates that a motion to strike a pleading must be filed \"within 21 days after being served \nwith the pleading.\" Chervon argues that its motion is not untimely because its motion to \nstrike \"is based on the [the PTAB's Final Written Decision] .\"2 D.I. 253 at 2. The relevant \npleading is not the PTAB's Final Written Decision. The relevant pleading is Defendants ' \nAmended Answer to Chervon's Second Amended Complaint , which was filed on January \n28, 2021. D.I. 171. Cherven did not file its motion to strike until December 8, 2021-314 \ndays after Defendants filed their Amended Answer. D.I. 246. Thus, Defendants ' motion \nto strike is untimely under Rule 12(f)(2). \nUnder Rule 12(f)(l), the Court may act sua sponte on Defendants ' motion to strike. \nThe Court sees no reason to do so here. \"Motions to strike affirmative defenses are \ndisfavored by courts.\" Procter & Gamble Co., 697 F. Supp. at 1362 (citation omitted). \nThe Court agrees with Defendants that Cherven' s motion to strike is an attempt to \"re-\n2 Chervon relies on the PTAB's Final Written Decision that the patents under review were \n\"allowable, patentable , and valid over [the withheld reference and] ... is therefore not but-for \nmaterial to the patentability of the asserted patents and claims as a matter of law.\" D .I. 24 7 at 1. \n3 litigate Defendants' successful motion to amend.\" D.I. 251 at 2. When deciding \nDefendants' Motion for Leave to Amend their Answer and Affirmative Defenses to \nChervon's Second Amended Complaint , this Court held \"Defendants' proposed amended \npleading adequately alleges that Plaintiffs omitted a figure from a prior art reference \ndisclosed in the [Information Disclosure Statement (\"IDS\")] that was material to the \npatentability of the invention, and the selective disclosure of the prior art reference without \ninclusion of the figure gives rise to a reasonable inference that the omission was made with \nthe specific intent to deceive the [United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\")].\" \nJan. 28, 2021 Oral Order; see also D.I. 250. Thus, this Court previously found that \nDefendants' inequitable conduct defense was sufficient and granted their Motion for Leave \nto Amend their Answer and Affirmative Defenses . See D.1. 250. For these reasons, \nDefendants ' inequitable conduct defense cannot be \"insufficient\" under Rule 12(f). The \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that \"the court may order stricken from a pleading \nany ... redundant, immaterial , impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). \n\"Immaterial matter is that which has no essential or important relationship to the claim for \nrelief or the defenses being pleaded. Impertinent matter consists of statements that do not \npertain, and are not necessary, to the issues in question. Scandalous allegations may be \nstricken if the matter alleged bears no possible relation to the controversy or may cause the \nobjecting party prejudice.\" Delaware Health Care, Inc. v. MCD Holding Co., 893 F. Supp. \n1279, 1291-92 (D. Del. June 30, 1995) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Cherven \nnever argued that Defendants' inequitable conduct defense is \"redundant, immaterial , \nimpertinent, or scandalous.\" See generally D.1. 247; D.I. 253. \n4 The Court also rejects Chervon' s requests that \"the Court treat its Motion as, or \nconvert it to, a Rule 12(c) motion.\" D.I. 253 at 2. Cherven raises this request for the first \ntime, in one sentence, at the end of its reply letter in support of its motion to strike. \n\"[A]rguments raised in passing (such as, in a footnote) , but not squarely argued, are \nconsidered waived.\" Samsung Elecs. Co. v. Netlist, Inc., No. 21-1453-RGA , 2022 WL \n3027312, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 1, 2022) (quoting John Wyeth & Brother Ltd. v. Cigna Int'! \nCorp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076, n.6 (3d Cir. 1997)). Chervon's request also violates Delaware \nLocal Rule 7.1.3(c)(2), which provides, in relevant part, that \"[t]he party filing the opening \nbrief shall not reserve material for the reply brief which should have been included in a full \nand fair opening brief.\" D. Del. LR 7.1.3(c)(2). \"This provision exists, in part, to prevent \nlitigants from engaging in impermissible 'sandbagging ,' reserving crucial arguments for a \nreply brief to which an opponent cannot respond.\" Fifth Mkt., Inc. v. CME Grp., Inc., C.A. \nNo. 08-520-GMS , 2013 WL 3063461, at * 1 (D. Del. June 19, 2013) (citing Rockwell \nTechs., LLC v. Spectra-Physics Lasers, Inc., No. 00-589-GMS , 2002 WL 531555, at *3 \n(D. Del. Mar. 26, 2002)). Arguments and evidence submitted in violation of this rule may \nbe excluded. See Bos. Sci. Scimed, Inc. v. Cordis Corp., 434 F. Supp. 2d 308,314 (D. Del. \nJune 15, 2006), rev 'din part on other grounds, 554 F.3d 982 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Chervon's \nrequest that the Court convert its motion to strike under Rule 12(\u00b1) to a Rule 12(c) motion \nviolates Delaware Local Rule 7.1.3(c)(2). Thus, the Court will not consider Chervon's \nrequest to convert its Rule 12(\u00b1) motion to a Rule 12(c) motion. \n5 IV. Conclusion \nFor the above reasons, Chervon's Motion to Strike Defendants' Inequitable \nConduct Affirmative Defense (D.I. 246) is DENIED . \n6 GREGORY B. WILLIAMS \nU.S. DISTRICT nJDGE "}
