WEBB, JR.,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      : \n v.     : Civil Action No. 2 1-1555-RGA  \n      : \nDE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,   : \net al.,       :  \n      : \n  Defendant s.   : \n \n \nWilliam J. Webb, Jr., James T. Vaughn Correct ional Center, Smyrna , Delaware .  Pro Se \nPlaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                   \n April        , 202 2 \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n ANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n Plaintiff  William J. Webb, Jr., a  pretrial detainee at James T. Vaughn Correctional  \nCenter  in Smyrna , Delaware,  filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  (D.I. 1).  \nPlaintiff  appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis.   (D.I. \n8).  He has also filed a motion for injunctive relief.  (D.I. 7).  The Court proceeds to \nscreen the Compla int pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(a).    \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff alleges  that Defendants violated  his constitutional \nrights on December 3, 2018, February 11, 2019, the month of April 2019, and August \n26. 2019.  He seeks injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive da mages.    \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which r elief may be granted, or seeks monetary \nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013).  S ee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner  seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant).  The C ourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Ericks on v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 2 \n (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his  \nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. at 94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .  \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim purs uant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant P laintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or fut ile.  See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id . at 1 1.  3 \n  A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).  El ements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiff \u2019s claims are time -barred.  He filed his complaint on October 28, 2021 as \ndetermined by the prisoner mailbox rule.  See Houston v. Lack , 487 U.S. 266 (1988); \nBurns v. Morton, 134 F.3d 109, 112 (3d Cir. 1998); Gibbs v. Decker , 234 F. Supp. 2d \n458, 463 (D. Del. 2002) .    \nFor purposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7  1983 claims are characterized as \npersonal injury actions.  Wilson v. Garcia , 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985).  In Delaware,  \n\u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two- year limitations period.  See  10 Del. Code \u00a7  8119; \nJohnson v. Cullen, 925 F.  Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996).  Section 1983 claims accrue \n\u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which its action is \nbased. \u201d  Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia, 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998).  4 \n The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that generally must be raised \nby the defendant, and it is waived if not properly raised.  See Bena k ex rel. Alliance \nPremier Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P.,  435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir. \n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon,  807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986).  \u201c Although \nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua sponte dismissal is appropriate \nwhen \u2018the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual \nrecord is required to be developed. \u2019\u201d  Davis v. Gauby , 408 F. App\u2019 x 524, 526 (3d Cir. \n2010)  (quoting Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)).  Hence,  a court \nmay dismiss a time -barred complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  \nPlaintiff  complains of act s that occurr ed on December 3, 2018, February 11, \n2019, the month of April 2019, and August 26,  2019.  He also complain s that the \nviolations are ongoing, yet the allegations do not support this claim as the Complaint \nspeaks to discrete acts on certain dates.  Plaintiff did not  file his Complaint until October \n28, 2021.  Hence,  all claim s that occurred prior to October 28, 2019 are time -barred.   All \nof Plaintiff\u2019s claims occurred prior to October 28,  2019.  It  is evident from the face of the \nComplaint that  Plaintiff\u2019s claims  a re barred by the two- year limitation period.   Therefore, \nthe Complaint wil l be dismiss ed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915(e)(2)(B) (i) and \u00a7 \n1915A(b)(1) .   \nAmendment is futile.  \n \n \n 5 \n  CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will :  (1) dismiss as moot Plaintiff\u2019s motion for \ninjunctive relief (D.I. 7); and (2) dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B) (i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).   The Court finds amendment futile.  \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nWILLIAM J.
