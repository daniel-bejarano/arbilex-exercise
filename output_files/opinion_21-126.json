BHATNAGAR \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nMATTHEW MEYER, WILSON B. \nDA VIS, and NEW CASTLE \nCOUNTY \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 21-126-CFC \nThomas S. Neuberger, Stephen J. Neuberger, THE NEUBERGER FIRM, P.A, \nWilmington, Delaware \nCounsel for Plaintiff \nMichael P. Kelly, Hayley J. Reese, Steven P. Wood, MCCARTER & ENGLISH, \nLLP, Wilmington, Delaware \nCounsel for Defendant \nDecember 20, 2021 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION C0LME.0NNOLL Y \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nPlaintiff San jay Bhatnagar filed this action against Defendants Matthew \nMeyer, Wilson Davis, and New Castle County (NCC or the County). D.I. 1. In \neach of the Complaint's three counts Bhatnagar alleges that he was terminated \nfrom his position as an Assistant County Attorney at the County in violation of the \nFouiteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. D.I. 1 ~~ 2-3. Pending before me \nis Defendants' motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(6) \nfor failure to state a claim. D.I. 9. \nI. BACKGROUND1 \nBhatnagar began working as an Assistant County Attorney for the County's \nlaw department in June 2017. D.I. 1 ~ 96. He is South Asian (of Indian descent) \nand a member of the Hindu religion. D.I. 1 ~~ 8-9. Meyer was at all relevant \ntimes the County Executive for NCC, and Davis was the County Attorney for \nNCC. D.I. 1 ~~ 11-12. \nWhile working as an Assistant County Attorney, Bhatnagar received a \npositive employment evaluation, D.I. 1 ~~ 119-120, and other praise for his work, \n1 When assessing the merits of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, I accept as true \nall factual allegations in the Complaint and view those facts in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff. See Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d \nCir. 2008). see, e.g., D.I. 1 ,r 126. On July 6, 2020, Bhatnagar sought assistance on a project \nfrom an outside law firm. D.I. 1 ,r,r 167-168. On July 7, 2020, Davis sent \nBhatnagar an email chastising Bhatnagar for seeking outside legal help. D.I. 1 ,r,r \n175-176. Bhatnagar replied that day via email and explained his reasons for \nseeking assistance from the law firm. D.I. 1 ,r 177. \nOn July 8, 2020, Davis fired Bhatnagar with Meyer's authorization. D.I. 1 \n,r,r 180-181, 186. Davis told Bhatnagar that Bhatnagar was being terminated \nbecause his July 7th email to Davis was grossly insubordinate. D.I. 1 ,r 183. In a \nsubsequent unemployment hearing, Bhatnagar was told he was fired because he \nbreached NCC protocol when he sought assistance with his work from a law firm. \nD.I. 1 ,r 202. \nIn Count I of the Complaint, Bhatnagar alleges that he was denied \"pre and \npost termination hearings\" in violation of his constitutional due process rights. D.I. \n1 ,r,r 294. In Count II, Bhatnagar alleges that he was terminated for a minor \noffense of NCC policy but that three comparator attorneys who are white, \nChristian, and female were not terminated for similar or more serious offenses, and \nthat his termination violated his \"constitutional right to the equal protection of the \nlaw and to be free of religious, race, national origin and/or sex discrimination.\" \nD.I. 1 ,r 339. In Count III, Bhatnagar alleges that the decisions of Meyer and Davis \n2 that resulted in his termination \"were policies, practices and/or customs fairly \nattributable to NCC.\" D.I. 1 ,r 342. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS FOR STATING A CLAIM \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a \nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the \ncomplaint must include more than mere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic \nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 555 (2007) ( citation omitted). The complaint must set forth enough \nfacts, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Id. at \n570. A claim is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ( citation \nomitted). Deciding whether a claim is plausible is a \"context-specific task that \nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" \nId. at 679 ( citation omitted). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Count I -Procedural Due Process Claim \n\"The requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation \nof interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty and \nproperty.\" Bd of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972). \n3 \"But the range of interests protected by procedural due process is not infinite.\" Id. \nat 570. A government employee \"who under state law, or rules promulgated by \nstate officials, has a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment \nabsent sufficient cause for discharge may demand the procedural protections of due \nprocess\" afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment. Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, \n573 (1975). Conversely, a government employee who holds his position \"at the \nwill and pleasure of' his employer has \"no property interest\" in his employment \nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341,345 n.8 \n(1976). Whether a county employee holds a property interest in his position \"must \nbe decided by reference to state law.\" Id. at 344. \nDefendants argue that Count I failed to state a cognizable due process claim \nbecause Bhatnagar was employed at will and thus did not have a protected property \ninterest in his employment. D.I. 10 at 6. I agree. \nSection 1394 of Title 9 of the Delaware Code provides that \"[t]he Assistant \nCounty Attorneys shall serve at the pleasure of the County Attorney.\" This \nunambiguous characterization of the Assistant County Attorney position ends the \nmatter. See Eliason v. Englehart, 133 A.2d 944, 946 (Del. 1999) (\"If a statute is \nunambiguous, there is no need for judicial interpretation, and the plain meaning of \nthe statutory language controls. If a statute is ambiguous, it should be construed in \na way that will promote its apparent purpose and harmonize with other statutes.\"). \n4 Bhatnagar has no property interest in his employment protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment, Bishop, 426 U.S. at 345 n.8, and therefore Count I fails to state a \ncognizable claim. \nRather than dispute the implications of 9 Del. C. \u00a7 1394, Bhatnagar argues \nthat this matter is governed by 9 Del. C. \u00a7 1381(3). D.I. 12 at 6-7. Under section \n1381, \n[t]he [NCC] Office of Human Resources, managed by the Chief Human \nResources Officer, who shall be qualified for the position by education, \nexperience and training, shall perform the following functions. \n( 1) Divide all County officers and employees into unclassified or \nclassified service, and assign all classified employees into position \nclassifications, based on duties performed and responsibilities \nassumed; \n(2) Establish a uniform pay plan for all classified employees based on \nthe classification of the position held; \n(3) Regulate employment and promotion according to competency \nand fitness, to be ascertained when possible by competitive \nexamination and, when not, by due consideration to qualifications and \nrecord performance; \n( 4) Establish tenure for all classified employees, providing for \ndiscipline, demotion and discharge for just cause only, with right of \nemployee appeal through provisions outlined in the New Castle \nCounty Code; and \n( 5) Create uniform provisions governing provisions of related sections \nof the New Castle County Code. \n9 Del. C. \u00a7 1381. Bhatnagar argues that, pursuant to\u00a7 1381(3), NCC developed a \ndiscipline policy with \"a 'just cause' standard for all discipline and a mandatory \n5 progressive discipline policy.\" D.I. 12 at 6-8 (citations omitted). It follows, he \ncontends, that Defendants violated his right to procedural due process when they \nterminated his employment in violation of this policy. D.I. 12 at 6-7. \nBhatnagar' s argument fails for three reasons. First, the text of section \n1381(3) does not authorize or require the County to develop a \"just cause\" standard \nfor Assistant County Attorneys. Second, Bhatnagar's reading of section 1381(3) \ncannot be squared with section 1394's express provision that an Assistant County \nAttorney \"shall serve at the pleasure of the County Attorney.\" (Emphasis added.) \nThird, section 1381 itself makes clear that the authority of the County's Office of \nHuman Resources to promulgate a \"just cause\" disciplinary policy comes from \nsection 1381(4), not section 1381(3); and section 1381(4) does not apply to \nAssistant County Attorneys. Section 1381(3) says nothing about discipline. \nSection 13 81 ( 4 ), by contrast, expressly references discipline; and it requires the \nCounty to \"provid[ e] for discipline, demotion and discharge for just cause only.\" \nBut section 1381(4) expressly limits the provision of\"discipline, demotion and \ndischarge for just cause only\" only to \"classified employees.\" Assistant County \nAttorneys, however, are not classified employees. On the contrary, under New \nCastle County Code\u00a7 26.01.002, \"[e]mployment in the County shall be divided \ninto classified and unclassified service\" and \"unclassified service shall consist of .. \n. the Council Attorney and Assistant Council Attorney(s).\" Thus, the NCC itself \n6 has excluded Assistant Council Attorneys, as unclassified employees, from the just \ncause requirement for discharge of9 Del. C. \u00a7 1381(4). \nAccordingly, I will dismiss Count I. \nB. Count II -Discrimination Claim \nThe crux of Bhatnagar' s discrimination claim is that he was terminated \nunlawfully because of his religion, race, and/or national origin and that \nDefendants' false allegation of insubordination is a pretext justification. D.I. 1 ,r,r \n301,307,309. When a plaintiff brings a discrimination claim under a pretext \ntheory, the McDonnell Douglas framework applies, and \nthe plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination by showing that ( 1) s/he is a member of a \nprotected class; (2) s/he was qualified for the position \ns/he sought to attain or retain; (3) s/he suffered an \nadverse employment action; and ( 4) the action occurred \nunder circumstances that could give rise to an inference \nof intentional discrimination. \nMakky v. Chertojf, 541 F.3d 205,214 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing McDonnell Douglas \nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973)). \nAt the outset, the parties dispute how to apply the McDonnell Douglas \nframework at the pleading stage. See, e.g., D.I. 13 at 6. Recognizing that the \nMcDonnell Douglas framework is an evidentiary standard and not a pleading \nstandard, the Third Circuit instructs that, \"[t]o defeat a motion to dismiss, it is \nsufficient to allege a prima facie case. But it is not necessary. The complaint need \n7 only allege enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal \nevidence of each necessary element.\" Martinez v. UPMC Susquehanna, 986 F.3d \n261, 265 (3d Cir. 2021) (internal alterations, quotation marks, and citations \nomitted). \"A plaintiff need not convince the court of any of these elements at the \nmotion to dismiss stage, but must submit more than naked assertion that he \nsuffered an adverse employment action because of his membership in a protected \nclass.\" Blades v. Mosaic of Delaware, 2017 WL 3868238, at *6 (D. Del. Aug. 31, \n2017) (citing Santos v. Iron Mountain Film & Sounds, 593 F. App'x 117, 119 (3d \nCir. 2014)). Therefore, arguments addressing the requirements for establishing a \nprima 'facie case or the resulting burden shifting under McDonnell Douglas are \npremature. I use the McDonnell Douglas framework here only for its utility in \nhelping me sort through the allegations made in the complaint to determine if \nBhatnagar has stated a plausible claim of discrimination. See Connelly v. Lane \nConst. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 791 (3d Cir. 2016). \nDefendants dispute only whether Bhatnagar can meet the pleading \nrequirement for the fourth element in the McDonnell Douglas framework, arguing \nthat he has not pleaded sufficient factual matter to establish a connection between \nhis termination and his religion, race, and/or national origin. D.I. 10 at 10. \nBhatnagar argues that he is \"[ a ]n able and qualified Hindu, South Asian, male \nattorney of Indian descent\" who \"was terminated for a minor offense while at least \n8 three comparable poorly performing Christian, white, native born, female attorneys \nwere not terminated.\" D.I. 12 at 15. Defendants argue that Bhatnagar's \n\"comparators are not similarly situated\" and \"did not engage in the same type of \nmisconduct cited for [Bhatnagar]'s termination.\" D.I. 10 at 12. \nBut the initial burden on the plaintiff at the motion to dismiss stage \"is not \nintended to be onerous.\" Marzano v. Comput. Sci. Corp. Inc., 91 F.3d 497, 508 \n(3d Cir. 1996) ( citations omitted). Bhatnagar need only allege \"enough factual \nmatter (taken as true) to suggest the required element.\" Wilkerson v. New Media \nTech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F .3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted). And, here, he alleges that the Pension Administrator \nand Human Resources Benefits Coordinator expressed \"frustrat[ion] with \n[comparator's] overall lack of cooperation and non-responsive attitude regarding \ncritical employee issues,\" D.I. 1 ,r 257 ( quotation marks omitted), and that a \ncomparator \"yelled at the former Chief Financial Officer David Gregor and \nDepartment of Finance representatives\" during a work meeting while comparator \nwas an Assistant County Attorney, D.I. 1 ,r 247. These allegations that other \nAssistant County Attorneys were not terminated despite engaging in \nunprofessional behavior and insubordination similar to the behavior for which \nBhatnagar was allegedly terminated are sufficient to state his claim. See Apau v. \nPrintpack Inc., 122 F. Supp. 2d 489, 490-91, 493-94 (D. Del. 2010) (denying a \n9 motion to dismiss because African American plaintiff \"presented minimal, but \nsufficient factual pleadings\" for his discrimination claim when he pied that he was \nterminated after allegedly damaging a cylinder but that two Caucasian employees \nwho damaged cylinders in the workplace were not punished). \nDefendants' argument that Bhatnagar' s comparators are not similarly \nsituated is premature for a motion to dismiss. \"A determination of whether \nemployees are similarly situated takes into account factors such as the employees' \njob responsibilities, the supervisors and decision-makers, and the nature of the \nmisconduct engaged in.\" Wilcher v. Postmaster Gen., 441 F. App'x 879, 882 (3d \nCir. 2011). But, at the motion to dismiss stage, I \"accept the complaint's \nallegations as true, read those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, \nand determine whether a reasonable reading indicates that relief may be \nwarranted.\" Umland, 542 F.3d at 64. Thus, Defendants' argument that \ncomparators' \"incompetence\" was different from Bhatnagar' s \"insubordination\" is \nmore appropriately adjudicated at a later stage. Reading Bhatnagar' s allegations in \nthe light most favorable to him, I find that \"lack of cooperation,\" D.I. 1 ,I 257, or \n\"yelling\" at coworkers during a weekly meeting, D.I. I ,I 247, could be considered \ninsubordination. Thus, Bhatnagar has proffered at least one circumstance giving \nrise to an inference of intentional discrimination sufficient to state a claim. \n10 C. Count III -Extending Liability to the County Claim \nBhatnagar alleges that NCC is liable because all the decisions made by the \nindividual defendants are attributable to NCC. D.I. 1 ,r 342. When a plaintiff \nasserts a claim against a local governmental body, the court must analyze \"( 1) \nwhether plaintiff's harm was caused by a constitutional violation, and (2) if so, \nwhether the [local governmental body] is responsible for that violation.\" Collins v. \nCity of Harker Heights, Tex., 503 U.S. 115, 120 (1992). Having found that \nBhatnagar has alleged a discrimination claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, I \nturn now to this second question. \n\"[A] municipality cannot be held liable solely because it employs a \ntortfeasor-or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 \non a respondeat superior theory.\" Monell v. Dep 't of Soc. Servs. of City of New \nYork, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978) (original emphasis). \"Instead, it is when execution \nof a government's policy or custom ... inflicts the injury that the government as an \nentity is responsible under\u00a7 1983.\" Id. at 694. Defendants argue that Bhatnagar \nfailed to allege that he was terminated pursuant to an existing and unconstitutional \nNCC policy. D.I. 10 at 19. In response, Bhatnagar argues (1) that \"[t]he fairly \npied policy, practice or custom is terminating Plaintiff's employment as an \nAssistant County Attorney,\" D.I. 12 at 19, and (2) that Meyer is a policymaker for \nNCC, so NCC is liable for his actions, D.I. 12 at 19. \n11 First, Bhatnagar has pied neither a policy nor a custom because he never \nalleges \"an official proclamation, policy, or an edict\" or custom \"so well-settled \nand permanent ... to constitute law.\" Est. of Roman v. City of Newark, 914 F.3d \n789, 798 (3d Cir.) (alterations and citations omitted), cert. denied sub nom. Est. of \nRoman v. City of Newark, New Jersey, 140 S. Ct. 82 (2019), and cert. denied, 140 \nS. Ct. 97 (2019). Terminating the employment of an Assistant County Attorney is \nneither an official policy nor a well-settled and permanent custom. \nSecond, \n[ m ]unicipal liability attaches only where the decisionmaker possesses final \nauthority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered. \nThe fact that \u00b7a particular official-even a policymaking official-has \ndiscretion in the exercise of particular functions does not, without more, give \nrise to municipal liability based on an exercise of that discretion. \nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 415 U.S. 469, 481-82 (1986). Pembaur further \nexplains that \nthe County [ official] may have discretion to hire and fire employees without \nalso being the county official responsible for establishing county \nemployment policy. If this were the case, the [official]' s decisions \nrespecting employment would not give rise to municipal liability .... \nInstead, if county employment policy was set by the Board of County \nCommissioners, only that body's decisions would provide a basis for county \nliability. This would be true even if the Board left the [ official] discretion to \nhire and fire employees and the [official] exercised that discretion in an \nunconstitutional manner .... \nId. at 484 n.12. This example given in Pembaur is exactly the issue at hand. \nBhatnagar argues that 9 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1394 and 1116 give Meyer and Davis the \n12 authority to establish NCC policy. D.I. 12 at 19. But section 1394 only gives the \nCounty Attorney the discretion to hire and fire Assistant County Attorneys, not to \nestablish the employment policy. See id. {\"The County Attorney shall appoint \nsuch Assistant County Attorneys as may be authorized by the County Council. \nThe Assistant County Attorneys shall serve at the pleasure of the County \nAttorney.\"). Similarly, section 1116 provides that the County Executive shall \n\"[s]ee that the duties and responsibilities of the executive and administrative \nagencies of the County are properly performed[,]\" \"[s]ee that the laws of the State \nrequired to be administered by the County, the provisions of this title, ordinances, \nand regulations of the County are enforced[,]\" and \"[r]eceive and examine \ncomplaints made against any officer or employee for neglect of duty or \nmalfeasance in office[.]\" Although Meyer and Davis may have discretion to hire \nand fire employees under these provisions, they are not responsible for establishing \nthe employment policy. Thus, liability for Meyer's and Davis's employment \ndecisions does not extend to NCC even if they exercised their discretion \nunconstitutionally. See Pembaur, 415 U.S. at 481-82. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, I will grant in part and deny in part \nDefendants' motion to dismiss (D.I. 9). I will dismiss Bhatnagar's procedural due \n13 process claim ( Count I) and county liability claim ( Count III) but will allow his \ndiscrimination claim ( Count II) to proceed. \nI also find that amending Count I and Count III would be futile. First, \nBhatnagar served at the pleasure of the County Attorney. He had no protected \nproperty interest in his employment and thus cannot plead a claim for violation of \nprocedural due process. Second, Meyer and Davis are not policymakers with \nrespect to creating employment policies per 9 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1394, 1116. Thus, \nBhatnagar cannot plead Monell liability for their alleged unconstitutional behavior. \nIn light of the governing state statutes, there are no additional facts Bhatnagar \ncould allege to plead these claims, making amendment futile. Therefore, I will \ndismiss Count I and Count III with prejudice. \n14 "}
