RIVERA,    :       :     Petitioner,  :       :   v.     : Civil Action No. 20-143-LPS       :  KOLAWOLE AKINBAYO, Warden, and  : ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE   : STATE OF DELAWARE,   :       :     Respondents.   : ______________________________________________________________________________    \nMEMORANDUM  \nI. BACKGROUND   \n Petitioner Michael A. Rivera (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) filed papers pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 \n(\u201cPetition\u201d) challenging his pretrial detainment in  the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in \nWilmington Delaware.  (D.I. 1)  The Petition a sserts the following claims: (1) defense counsel \nviolated the attorney-client privilege and failed to  address pretrial issues such as missing evidence, \nillegal search and seizure, and invalid evidence; (2 ) he is being held illegally because his bail is \nexcessive; (3) he is subject to unsanitary prison conditions and overcrowding; and (4) he wants a \n\u201creverse Franks  hearing.\u201d  (D.I. 1 at 1-2)  For relief in th is proceeding, Petitioner asks the Court to \n\u201cremedy the petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 as it deems necessary and as justice requires.\u201d  (D.I. 1 \nat 2)  II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA district court judge may summarily dismiss a habe as petition \u201cif it plainly appears from the \nface of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it th at the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d  Rule 2\u00a0\n\u00a04, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.  As a general rule, a federal district court can only entertain a habeas \npetition in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, and a petitioner \nis not entitled to federal habeas relief unless he ha s exhausted state remedies for his habeas claims.  \nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) and (b)(1)(A); see also Rules 1- 2, 28 U.S. C. foll. \u00a7 2254.   \nIII. PRETRIAL JURISDICTION \nAlthough a state prisoner can challenge hi s pre-trial custody on speedy trial grounds \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, a federal court cannot  provide habeas review fo r pre-trial claims if the \npetitioner is trying to abort his state criminal proceeding, because such adjudication would constitute \npremature litigation of constitutional defenses in federal court.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); Moore v. \nDeYoung , 515 F.2d 437, 441-42 (3d Cir. 1975) ; Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky , 410 U.S. \n484, 493 (1973) (noting that habeas corpus review is  not available to adjudicate merits of affirmative \ndefense to state criminal charge prior to state co urt conviction, but that, in special circumstances, \nhabeas corpus is appropriate vehicle by which to demand enforcement of state\u2019s constitutional obligation to provide speedy trial).  At the time of filing, Petitioner was not in custody pursuant to a \nstate court judgment, because he had not yet underg one his state criminal trial on the charges for \nwhich he was arrested.  Petitioner also had not ex hausted his state remedies with respect to his bail \nissue.  Finally, the Petition does not raise a speedy trial claim.  Thus, as filed, Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 \nPetition does not present a proper basis for pre-trial habeas relief.\n1   \n \n\u00a0\n1To the extent Petitioner complains about the unsani tary conditions in prison, such matters are not \nproperly pursued via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.  Rather, suits challenging conditions of confinement are \nproperly brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  See Muhammad v. Close , 540 U.S. 749, 750 (2004) \n(\u201c[R]equests for relief turning on circumstances of confinement may be presented in a \u00a7 1983 \naction.\u201d). 3\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nIV.  MOOTNESS \nPursuant to Article III of the Constitution, federa l courts can only consider ongoing cases or \ncontroversies.  Lewis v. Continental Bank, Corp. , 494 U.S. 472, 477-78 (1990);  United States v. Kissinger , \n309 F.3d 179, 180 (3d Cir. 2002) (finding that a ctual controversy must exist during all stages of \nlitigation).  The \u201ccase-or-controversy requirement su bsists through all stages of federal judicial \nproceedings,\u201d Lewis, 494 U.S. at 477-78, and there must be \u201ca  live case or controversy at the time \nthat a federal court decides the case,\u201d Burke v. Barnes , 479 U.S. 361, 363 (198 7).  \u201c[T]he question of \nmootness is one . . . which a federal court must  resolve before it assumes jurisdiction.\u201d  North \nCarolina v. Rice , 404 U.S. 244, 246 (1971).   \nAfter filing the instant \u00a7 2241 Petition, Petitioner was convicted and sentenced.2  Since he is \nnow in custody pursuant to a state court judgment of conviction, Petitioner\u2019s challenges to his pre-\ntrial detention are moot.  See, e.g.,  Williams v. New Jersey,   2020 WL 3259223, at *2 (D.N.J. June 16, \n2020) (state prisoner\u2019s guilty plea moots his \u00a7 2241 habeas petition challenging his pretrial \ndetention); Jones v. Mullen,   2017 WL 7691900, at *2 (W.D. Pa . Dec. 8, 2017) (\u201c[W]here a habeas \npetitioner is challenging pretrial custody, after the petitioner is convicted, the habeas petition \nchallenging the pretrial custody is rendered moot by the conviction.\u201d), report and recommendation \nadopted by , 2018 WL 889027 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 14, 2018).   To the extent Petitioner may wish to \nchallenge his current detention, he can file a peti tion for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 2254.  \n \n\u00a0\n2According to Vinelink, Delaware\u2019s online inmate locator, Petitioner was sentenced on January 21, \n2022.  See https://vinelink.vineapps.com/person-detail/defendant/14463130;tabIndexToSelect=0 . 4\u00a0\n\u00a0V.   CONCLUSION  \n For the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Petition for \nlack of jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Baker v. Warden Cumberland Cnty. Prison , 2019 WL 2612772, at *1 (3d Cir. \nMay 9, 2019) (\u201cTo the extent that any of Appella nt\u2019s claims may not be moot, jurists of reason \nwould agree, without debate, that  the District Court correctly declin ed to exercise pretrial habeas \njurisdiction over his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.\u201d).  The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of \nappealability because Petitioner has failed to make  a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a \nconstitutional right.\u201d  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d  Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer , 113 \nF.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997).  A separate Order will be entered.     \n            ________________________________                         \nSeptember 12, 2022     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n \n                  \n \u00a0 \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n MICHAEL A.
