Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Kilolo Kijakazi is substituted \nfor former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul, who was originally named as \nDefendant in this suit.   2 BURKE, United States Magistrate Judge \nPlaintiff Timothy Z. Neely (\u201c Neely \u201d or \u201cPlaintiff\u201d ) appeals from a decision of Defendant \nKilolo Kijakazi, the Acting  Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d  or \n\u201cDefendant\u201d ), denying Neely\u2019s  application for disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title \nII of the Social Security Act  (\u201cSSA\u201d) , and supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits under \nTitle XVI  of the SSA .  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-34 & 1381-1383f.  Th e Court  has jurisdiction over \nthe matter pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).   \n Presently pending before the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Neely  and the Commissioner (the \u201cmotions\u201d) .  (D.I. 12; D.I.  14)  Neely  asks the Court to reverse \nthe Commissioner\u2019s decision and either remand to the Commissioner with an instruction that benefits be awarded or remand for further proceedings.  (D.I. 13 at 1, 20)  The Commissioner opposes that request and asks that the Court affirm h er decision.  (D.I. 16 at 7)  For the reasons \nset forth below, Neely \u2019s motion for summary judgm ent will be GRANTED- IN-PART and \nDENIED -IN-PART, the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment will be DENIED  \nand the case will be REMANDED to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. I.  BACKGROUND A.  Procedural  Background \nOn April 24, 2018 and April 26, 2019, Neely  applied  for DIB and SSI benefits , \nrespectively ; he alleged disability beginning on October 11, 2016.  (D.I. 9 (hereinafter \u201cTr.\u201d) at \n100-101, 113, 194, 208, 232; D.I. 13 at 2)  His claim was denied initially and then again upon reconsideration.  ( Tr. at 113-17, 125-30)  Neely  then filed a request for an administrative  \n3 hearing.  ( Id. at 136- 37)  On January 7, 2020, a hearing was held before an Administrative Law \nJudge (\u201cALJ\u201d) , at which Neely  was represented by counsel .  (Id. at 61-97, 156)   \nOn January 28, 2020, the ALJ issued a decision  denying Neely\u2019s  request for  benefits.   \n(Id. at 43- 52)  Neely  requested review of the ALJ\u2019s decision by the Appeals Council , and the \nAppeals Council later denied Neely \u2019s appeal on the merits .  (Id. at 1-4)  Thus, the ALJ\u2019s decision \nbecame the final decision of the Commissioner.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.955 & 404.981; Si ms v. \nApfel , 530 U.S. 103, 106- 07 (2000).  \nOn November 18, 2020, Neely  filed a Complaint in this Court seeking judicial review of \nthe ALJ\u2019s decision .  (D.I. 1)  On Ju ly 9, 2021, Neely  filed his motion for summary judgment.  \n(D.I. 1 2)  The Commissioner opposed Neely \u2019s motion and filed a cross -motion for summary \njudgment on August 3, 2021.  (D.I. 1 4)  Briefing on the respective motions was completed on \nSeptember 3, 2021.  (D.I. 18)  And on November 9, 2021, the parties consented to the Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to conduct all proceedings in this action, including entry of a final judgment.  (D.I. \n20)      \nB.  Factual  Background  \nAt the time of the  alleged onset of his disability on October 11, 2016, Neely  was 54 years \nold; at the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision  in January 2020, he  was 57.  ( See Tr. at 100)  Neely  is a \nhigh school graduate , (id. at 233),  and has past work experiences  as, inter alia , a billing cle rk and \nclosing clerk .  (Id. at 221; see D.I. 13 at 3 ).   \n1.  Plaintiff\u2019s Medical History, Treatment, and Condition  \nNeely alleges that he has been disabled and unable to work since October 2016 due to \nvarious medical conditions  related to a serious  car accident .  (Tr. at 232, 300)   Relevant evidence \nof record regarding those conditions is set out below. 4 a. Physical Medical History2 \nNeely  alleges that he suffers from the following physical conditions  stemming from the \naccident :  (1) cervical radiculopathy ; (2) lumbar radiculopathy; ( 3) lumbar spinal stenosis ; and \n(4) chronic pain .  (Id. at 93, 232, 712- 13; D.I. 13 at 2, 6)   With regard to his cervical  and lumbar  \nradiculopathy, a nerve conduction study and needle electromyography (\u201cEMG\u201d)  led to Neely \nbeing diagnosed, inter alia , with those conditions in late  2016.  ( Tr. at 300 -01, 307, 721- 22)  As \nto Neely\u2019s lumbar spinal stenosis, a n MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine resulted in Neely\u2019s \ndiagnosis around that same time .  (Id. at 296, 301 )  Despite injections, several surgeries, and \nphysical therapy, Neely continues to report ongoing neck and back pain, even while taking \nmedication f or pain management.  ( See, e.g., id. at  668- 70, 756- 59, 860, 862, 938- 74)  Neely also \nalleges that he continues to suffer from muscle spasms, tenderness, reduced range of motion, and stiffness as a result of his injuries.  ( See, e.g., id. at 707- 08, 749- 58, 894- 901) \nb. Mental  Health -related  Medical History  \nNeely  alleges that he also suffers from a number of mental  health -related issues \nstemming from the injuries he suffered in the accident.  Below , the Court summarizes the \nrelevant record regarding Neely\u2019s men tal health  history. \nFrom the month of his accident (October 2016) through to October 2019, Neely had \nvarious physical examinations, but during those examinations , he reported that he had no anxiety \nor depression and that he had a desire to continue living.  ( Id. at 32 4, 326, 582, 866)  Neely \n \n2  Neely\u2019s arguments on appeal relate almost exclusively to his mental health -related \nmedical  conditions.  ( D.I. 13; D.I. 16 at 2)   Therefore , the Court will here offer only a brief \nsummary of Neely \u2019s physical medical  history.  5 disclosed no decrease in consciousness, no confusion, no disorientation, and no memory lapse or \nloss.  ( Id. at 325- 26) \nIn October 2019, Neely consulted with mental health nurse practitioner, Michal \nTomaszewi cz.  Neely attend ed three sessions  with Mr. Tomaszewicz, the last of which was in \nNovember 2019.  ( Id. at 976-94; D.I. 13 at 7- 8)  During these sessions, Neely  reported chronic \npain, poor sleep, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, low energy, irritability, and an inability to actively play with his grandchildren.  (Tr. at 976, 983)  In his treatment notes, Mr. Tomaszewicz \ndescribed Neely as  having a careless appearance, feeling depressed, anxious and irritated, having \na constricted affect, havi ng impaired abstract reasoning and being constantly tired with little \nenergy .  (Id. at 978- 79, 983- 84, 989- 90)  That said, in these sessions, Neely was also reported to \nhave normal judgment and insight , no signs of  psychotic thought process or content , intact recent \nand remote memory  and intact concentration and attention span.  ( Id.)   \nMr. Tomaszewicz diagnosed Neely in October 2019 as having m ajor depressive disorder, \ngeneralized a nxiety disorder, m ood disorder, and insomnia ; he proscribed medication for Neely \nto address each of these issues .  (Id. at 979, 985, 991)  Neely was never hospitalized during this \ntime period , nor was  he participating in psychotherapy.  ( Id. at 976, 979, 984)  \nOn December 10, 2019, Mr. Tomaszewicz completed a Psychological Functional \nCapacity statement  regarding Neely .  (Id. at 995- 97)  Therein, Mr. Tomaszewicz answered \u201cno\u201d \nto the question asking w hether Neely had \u201cthe ability to perform simple, repetitive work 40 hours \nper we ek, without missing more than 2 days of work per month[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 995)  By way of \nexplanation, Mr. Tomaszewicz wrote that  Neely had \u201cchanges in his sleep [that] lead to fatigue . \n. . also poor focus, low concentration [and]  changes in mood and energy[.]\u201d   (Id.)  Mr. \nTomaszewicz also wrote \u201cno\u201d when asked if Neely had the ability to remain \u201con task\u201d for \u201cat 6 least 80% of the work day[,]\u201d explaining that this was due to the \u201cseverity and frequency of \n[Neely\u2019s] depressive symptoms\u201d and his difficulty in controlling his insomnia.   (Id.)  Mr. \nTomaszewicz also identified the degree of Neely\u2019s impairment as  being \u201cModerate Severe\u201d or \n\u201cSevere\u201d in a few areas, including \u201c[s]ustain work performance [and] attendance in a normal work setting[,]\u201d \u201c[c]ope with pressures of ordinary work\u201d and \u201c[p]erform routine, repetitive tasks under ordinary supervision[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 997)  \n2.  The Administrative Hearing  \nAt the administrative hearing  held  on January 7, 2020, the ALJ heard Neely\u2019s  testimony \nand that of Christina Beatty -Cody, an impartial Vocational Expert (\u201cVE\u201d).  ( Id. at 60- 97) \na. Neely \u2019s Testimony  \nAt the hearing, Neely  provided some basic personal information to start and then began \nto discuss his work history.  ( Id. at 64- 76)  In 2004, he worked for the Salvation Army.  ( Id. at \n66)  From 2005 to 2010, he worked for the McConnell Group; in that role, he processed invoices \nfor contractors used by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development  \n(\u201cHUD\u201d) and he reviewed  the credentials  of certain of  those contractors.  ( Id. at 66- 69)  From \n2012 to 2013, Neely was employed i n a similar role at  two different  companies :  Corporate \nAllocation Services  and then Catmead Information Technology.  ( Id. at 73)   Then in 2016, Neely \nworked at Robert Half , where he had a different role; there , he v erified and processed appraisal \nand closing documents for homes that would be sold through HUD.  ( Id. at 73-75)   \nEventually, questioning turned to Neely\u2019s  car accident.   (Id. at 78 , 82)  Neely testified \nthat while driving on Interstate -95, a car cut him off and then came to a full stop in front of him ; \nNeely\u2019s car crashed directly into that  other car.  ( Id. at 8 2-83)  He was transported  by ambulance 7 to Crozer -Chester Medical Center in Chester, P ennsylvania .  (Id.)  In the accident , he injured his \nshoulders, his pelvis and his lower back.  ( Id.)  \nNeely next testified about the treatment he received for the physical injuries he sustained \nin the accident.  He exp lained that he was seen by Dr. Pramod Ya dhati and was given neck \ninjections that did not improve his injuries.  ( Id. at 83- 84)  He was also  treated  by Dr. Pawan \nRastogi ; in January of 2017, Neely reported to Dr. Ras togi that he had  continuing pain in his \nshoulder, neck, and back.  ( Id. at 84 -85)  In April 2017, Dr. R astogi performed surgery on \nNeely\u2019s neck  (a C5 -6 and C6- 7 anterior cervical discectomy  and fusion with cervical plate ) and \nin November 2017, Dr. Rastogi  performed surgery on Neely\u2019s back (a bilateral L4 -5 \nlaminectomy and left microdiscectomy) .  (Id. at 85 -86; see also id . at 319- 22, 334- 35, 556- 61, \n584, 597, 599- 601)  Neely explained that he did not get any relief from his back surgery; he still \nexperiences back pain that w ill shoot up into his rectum and renders him unable to move until the \npain relents .  (Id. at 86 , 93)  He also noted that in 2018, he visited Dr. Shelly McPhatter for \nphysical therapy.  ( Id. at 86; see also id. at 874- 93)   \nNeely additionally  testified that in May 2018 he saw his primary care doctor, Dr. Wayne \nTucker, for sleep issues relating to his pain.  ( Id. at 86-87; see also id . at 752)  Neely explained \nthat at present, he  has a hard time sleeping  and could only sleep for three to four hours at night \nand for a  few hours during the day.  ( Id. at 87)  He  has difficulty sleeping while lying down \nbecause he cannot get comfortable, so he often sleeps in a chair or by laying on his side.  ( Id. at \n87-88)   \nNeely noted that he was also treated by a chiropractor \u2014Dr. Matthew McIlrath \u2014and that \nhis last appointment with Dr. McIlrath  was in October 2019.  ( Id. at 88)   Thereafter, Neel y was 8 referred to Dr. Bruce Grossinger for a n EMG (previously discussed above), where it was \ndiscovered that he has radiculopathy ( i.e., nerve damage).  ( Id. at 89)   \nNeely also explained how in late 2019, he started seeing a psychotherapist , Mr. \nTomaszewicz, whom he visits a bout once a month.  ( Id. at 89- 90)  Neely noted that Mr. \nTomaszewicz recommended  that he take two types of sleeping pills, but that those pills  caused \nproblems, including that Neely would have difficulty waking up after he took the medication.  \n(Id. at 90 -91)   \nNeely completed his test imony by emphasizing that he continues to regularly  experience \npain \u201cfrom out of nowhere\u201d after moving around; the pain immob ilizes him for a time, until it \nrecedes.  ( Id. at 93)  \nb. Vocational Expert\u2019s Testimony  \nVE Beatty -Cody also testified during the hearing.  S he explained that she was aware of \nNeely\u2019s previous jobs.  ( Id. at 79)  She stated that Neely\u2019s work at Robert Half  would be \nconsidered to be work as a \u201cclosing clerk\u201d ; this job is  typically performed at the sedentary  level \nof exertion  (though Neely reported performing it at the medium level  of exertion ) and is listed as \na Skilled Vocational Preparation (\u201cSVP\u201d) Level 5  position.  ( Id. at 81 )  Neely\u2019s  experience \nworking with HUD while at the McConnell Group and in the ot her similar jobs he held thereafter \nwould each be considered work as a \u201cbilling clerk\u201d; this work would be classified as requiring a sedentary level of exertion, and was an  SVP Level 4.  ( Id.)  \nNext, the ALJ asked whether there were skills associated with Neely\u2019s prior jobs that \nwould be transferrable , to which the VE responded in the negative .  (Id. at 94)   Then the ALJ \ngave the VE a hypothetical:    9 [A]ssume an individual of the claimant\u2019s ag e, education , and \nexperience if such an individua l is able to perform sedentary work; \noccasionally push and pull with the upper  extremities ; occasionally \nclimb ramps and stairs;  never climb ladders, ropes , or scaffolds; \n[can] frequently  balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl ; \noccasionally reach overhead bilaterally; and tolerate occasional \nexposure to extreme cold, extreme heat, vibrations , and hazards. \nWould such an individual be able to perform the claimant\u2019s past \nwork?    \n (Id. at 94- 95)  The VE considered the se limitations  and noted that such an indi vidual would be \nable to perform Neely\u2019s \u201cpast work of billing clerk and closing clerk . . . as [] typically \nperformed in the national economy.\u201d  ( Id. at 95)   The A LJ later posed another hypothetical :   \nIf in addition to the limitations I[ have] already listed, the individual required the opportunity to move from a seated position to a standing position or vice versa for up to five minutes throughout every hour, remaining on task.  W ould th at impact  your \nresponse regarding the jobs you\u2019ve  . . . classified and indicated . . . would be available?  \n \n(Id.)  The  VE responded that were this the case, it would not impact her response .  (Id.)\n3  She \nconcluded by confirming that her testimony was \u201cconsistent with t he Dictionary of Occupational \nTitles  and the [ Selected Characteristics of Occupations , or] SCO[.]\u201d  (Id . at 96 (emphasis in \noriginal))     \n3.  The ALJ\u2019s Findings  \n \n3   Neely \u2019s counsel also questioned the VE.  Counsel asked the VE \u201c[i]f an individual \nwere limited with the dominant arm to less than occasional reaching, would any of the past jobs \nbe available?\u201d  ( Tr. at 95)  The VE noted that they would not be available .  (Id.)  Counsel also \nasked the VE, in her professional experience, what an employer\u2019s tolerance would be for \u201coff \ntask behavior[.]\u201d  ( Id.)  The VE  stated that \u201c[l]ess than 15% of the work day and that would be \nabove and beyond the breaks typically allowe d.\u201d  ( Id. at 95 -96)  Counsel also asked the VE what, \nin her professional experience, would be an employer\u2019s \u201ctolerance for absences [.]\u201d  (Id. at 96)   \nThe VE noted that, in her experience, \u201cif an employee has absences of more than one day per  \nmonth, it would be considered excessive by the employer and work preclusive.\u201d  ( Id.)  10 On January 28, 2020, the ALJ issued  the decision, which included the following seven  \nfindings:  \n1.  The claimant meets the insured status requirements of the \nSocial Security Act through December 31, 2022. . . .  \n \n2.  The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since October 11, 2016, the alleged onset date (20 CFR 404.1571 et seq ., and 416.971 et seq .). . . .  \n 3.  The claimant has the following severe impairments:  degenerative disc disease of cervical and lumbar spine; peripheral neuropathy and radiculopathy; and obesity (20 CFR 404.1520(c)  \nand 416.920(c) ). . . .  \n 4.  The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(d), 404.1525, 404.1526, 416.920(d), 416.925 and 416.926).  . . .  \n 5.  After careful consideration of the entire record, the [ALJ] finds \nthat the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(a) and 416.967(a) except occasionally push and pull with the upper extrem ities; \noccasionally climb ramps and stairs; never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; frequently balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; occasionally reach overhead bilaterally; and tolerate occasional exposure to extreme cold, extreme heat, vibrations , and hazards. . . \n.  6.  The claimant is capable of performing past relevant work as a closing clerk and billing clerk.  This work does not require the performance of work -related activities precluded by the claimant\u2019s \nresidual functional capacity (20 CFR 404.1565 and 416.965). . . .  7.  The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security Act, from October 11, 2016, through the date of this decision (20 CFR 404.1520(f) and 416.920(f)).  \n(Id. at 45- 51 (emphasis omitted) )  The relevant additional content of the ALJ\u2019s decision will be \ndiscussed in greater detail below. 11 II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA.  Motion for Summary Judgment  \nBoth parties filed motions for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 56.  \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  In determining the appropriateness of summary judgment, the Court \nmust \u201creview the record as a whole, \u2018draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of the non -\nmoving party\u2019 but not weighing the evidence or making credibility determinations.\u201d  Hill v. City of Scranton, 411 F.3d 118, 124- 25 (3d Cir. 2005) (alteration in original) (quoting Reeves v. \nSanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000)).   \nB.  Review of the ALJ\u2019s Findings  \nThe Court must uphold the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by \n\u201csubstantial evidence [.]\u201d  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Knepp v. Apfel , 204 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir. \n2000).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d m ay be  less than a preponderance of the evidence but  must be  \nmore than a mere scintilla of evidence; it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion [.]\u201d  Rutherford v. Barnhart , 399 F.3d 546, 552 (3d \nCir. 2005) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In analyzing whether substantial \nevidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings, the Court may not undertake a de novo review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision and may not re -weigh the evidence of record.  See \nMonsour Med. Ctr. v. Heckler , 806 F.2d 1185, 1190- 91 (3d Cir. 1986).  Even if the reviewing \nCourt would have decided the factual inquiry differently, it must defer to the ALJ and affirm the \nCommissioner\u2019s decision, so long as the decision is supported by substantial evidence.  Hartranft \nv. Apfel , 181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir. 1999); Monsour , 806 F.2d at 1190- 91. 12  In addition to conducting an inquiry into whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s \ndetermination, the Court must also review the ALJ\u2019s decision to  determin e whether the correct \nlegal stan dards were applied.  Schaudeck v. Comm\u2019r of Soc . Sec., 181 F.3d 429, 431 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  The Court\u2019s review of legal issues is plenary.  Sykes v. Apfel , 228 F.3d 259, 262 (3d Cir. \n2000) . \nIII.  DISCUSSION  \nIn resolving the instant motions, the Court will first  summarize  the relevant law regarding \nthe disability determination process.  It will then go on to assess Neely \u2019s arguments on appeal.  \nA.  Disability  Determination Process  \n  Title II of the SSA  \u201cprovides for the payment of insurance benefits to persons who have \ncontributed to the program and who suffer from a physical or mental disability.\u201d  Bowen v. \nYuckert , 482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987).  Title XVI of the SSA provides for the payment of disability \nbenefits to indigent persons under the SSI program.  Tate v. Berryhill , C.A. No. 15- 604-LPS, \n2017 WL 1164525, at *5 (D. Del.

Bowen, 926 F.2d 240, 244 (3d Cir. 1990).  A \u201cdisability\u201d is defined for purposes of DIB and SSI as the inability \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A)  & 423(d)(1)(A);  see also  Tate , 2017 WL 1164525, at *5.  \nA claimant is disabled \u201c only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such \nseverity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, \neducation, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantia l gainful work which 13 exists in the national economy[ .]\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(B)  & 423(d)(2)(A);  see also \nBarnhart v. Thomas , 540 U.S. 20, 21- 22 (2003) ; Tate , 2017 WL 1164525, at *5.   \nIn determining whether a person is disabled, t he Commissioner is required to perform a \nfive-step sequential analysis.  See 20 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520 &  416.920; see also Russo v. Astrue , \n421 F. App\u2019x. 184, 188 (3d Cir. 2011).  If a finding of disability or non- disability can be made at \nany point in the seque ntial process, the Commissioner will not review the claim further.  See 20 \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)  & 416.920(a)(4).  \n At step one, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant is engaged in \nsubstantial gainful activity.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i) (mandating a finding of non- disability \nwhen claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity) ; 20 C .F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a) (4)(i) (same) .  If \nthe claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful activity, step two requires the Commissioner to \ndetermine whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment or a combination of \nimpairments that is severe.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii) (mandating a finding of non- disability \nwhen claimant\u2019s impairments are not severe) ; 20 C .F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii)  (same) .  If the \nclaimant\u2019s impairments are severe, then the Commissioner proceeds to step three and must compare the claimant\u2019s impairments to a lis t of impairments (the \u201clistings\u201d) that are presumed \nsevere enough to preclude any gainful work.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii)  & \n416.920(a)(4)(iii) ; Plummer v. Apfel , 186 F.3d 422, 428 (3d Cir. 1999).  When a claimant\u2019s \nimpairment meets or equals an impa irment in the listings, the claimant is presumed disabled.  See  \n20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii)  & 416.920(a)(4)(iii) .  If a claimant\u2019s impairment fails to meet or \nmedically equal any listing, the Commissioner should proceed to steps four and five.  20 C.F.R. \n\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e)  & 416.920(e) . 14  At step four, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant retains the residual \nfunctional capacity (or \u201cRFC\u201d) to perform  his or her past relevant work.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n404.1520(a)(4)(iv) (stating that a claimant is not disabled if he or she is able to return to past \nrelevant work) ; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv)  (same) ; Plummer , 186 F.3d at 428.  A claimant\u2019s \nRFC is \u201cthat which an individual is still able to do despite the limitations caused by his or her impairment(s).\u201d  Johnson v . Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 529 F.3d 198, 201 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  \u201cThe claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to [his or] her past relevant work.\u201d  Plummer , 186 F.3d at 428. \n If the claiman t is unable to return to his or her past relevant work, step five requires the \nCommissioner to determine whether the claimant\u2019s impairments preclude him or her from adjusting to any other available work.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4 )(v) & (g) (mandating a finding \nof non- disability when the claimant can adjust to other work and a finding of disability when the \nclaimant cannot do so) ; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v) & (g)  (same) ; Plummer , 186 F.3d at 428.  \nAt this last step, the burden of production is on the C ommissioner to show that the claimant is \ncapable of performing other available work before denying disability benefits.  Plummer , 186 \nF.3d at 428.  In other words, the ALJ must show that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national  economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with [his or] her \nmedical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and [RFC] .\u201d  Id.  When making this \ndetermination, the ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of all of the claimant\u2019s impairmen ts.  \nId.  At this step, the ALJ often seeks the assistance of a VE (as the ALJ did here) .  Id. \nB.  Neely \u2019s Arguments on Appeal  \nOn appeal, Neely  presents two  sets of arguments .  First, he  asserts that the ALJ erred in \nvarious ways at step two in determining that his  mental impairments were not severe.  ( D.I. 13 at 15 11-16)  Second, he argues that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical  question and  RFC determination failed to \ninclude limitations relating to all of his  credibly established mental health limitations.  ( Id. at 16-\n19)  The Court addresses these arguments in turn.  \n1.  The ALJ\u2019s Severity Findings at Step Two  \nAt step two, although the ALJ found that certain of Neely\u2019s physical conditions amounted \nto severe impairments, she did not find that any of  Neely\u2019s mental health conditions were severe.  \n(Tr. at 45 -47)  In the ALJ\u2019s decision itself, the ALJ explicitly addressed only one of Neely\u2019s \nmental health conditions:  depression.  ( Id.)  As to that condition, the ALJ wrote that Neely\u2019s \n\u201cmedically determinable mental impairment of depression does not cause more than minimal \nlimitation in [his] ability to perform basic mental work activities and is therefore non [-]severe.\u201d  \n(Id. at 46)   \nIn explaining the rationale for this \u201cnon- severe\u201d determination as to Neely\u2019s depression, \nthe A LJ noted that Mr. Tomaszewicz had opined to the contrary, but she went on to explain why \nshe felt that Mr. Tomaszewicz\u2019s opinion was not persuasive.  ( Id.)  The  ALJ also consider ed the \nfour broad areas of mental functioning for evaluating mental disorders , which are commonly \nknown as the \u201cparagraph B\u201d criteria.  (Id.)  The  ALJ concluded that N eely had no limitation in \ntwo of the areas of mental functioning (\u201cunderstanding, remembe ring or applying information\u201d \nand \u201cadapting or managing oneself\u201d) and only a \u201c mild\u201d limitation in the other two areas \n(\u201cinteracting with others\u201d and \u201cconcentrating, persisting or maintaining pace\u201d) .  (Id (citing 20 \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a (c)(3)  & 416.920a(c)(3); see also  20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(d)(1) &  \n416.920a(d)(1) (noting that , with regard to the degree of a claimant\u2019s mental limitations, if the  \ndegree of limitation is \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cmild\u201d then the Commissioner will generally conclude that the 16 person\u2019s impai rment is \u201cnot severe\u201d))   The ALJ cited these conclusions as further support for her \n\u201cnon-severe\u201d determination.  \nNeely contends that the ALJ  erred in various ways in deciding that  his mental \nimpairments  were no t severe.  (D.I. 13 at 11- 16)  Neely breaks up these claims of error into four \ndifferent subparts, arguing that the AL J wrongfully failed to consider:  (1) the complete mental \nexam findings regarding his depression that are contained in his  medical records ; (2) Neely\u2019s \nwritten testimony  about  his limitations ; (3) all of Neely\u2019s mental health impairments  (including \nhis insomnia and anxiety disorder) ; and (4) the cumulative effect of Neely\u2019s mental health \nlimitations in combination with the pain and fatigue he faced due to lack of sleep.  ( D.I. 13 at 12)    \nBelow, a fter setting out more information about the legal standards for step two review, \nthe Court will a ddress all four subparts of Neely\u2019s step two -related arguments.  \na. Step Two Legal Standard s \nAt step two, an ALJ determines whether a claimant\u2019s health conditions amount to \n\u201csevere\u201d  impairments  (or, put another way, whether they are \u201cnon -severe\u201d) .  A non- severe \nimpairment is one that \u201cdoes not significantly limit [the claimant\u2019s] physical ability to do basic \nwork activities.\u201d  Newell v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 546 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration in original) ; see also  20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1522(a)  \n& 416.922(a) .  \u201cBasic work activities ,\u201d as that term relates to me ntal activities, include :  (1) \nunderstanding, carrying out and remembering simple instructions ; (2) use of judgment ; (3) \nresponding appropriately to supervision, co -workers and usual work situations ; and (4)  dealing \nwith changes in a routine work setting.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1522(b)(3) -(6) &  416.922(b)(3) -(6). \nThis step two analysis is a de minimis  screening device meant to dispose of groundless \nclaims; thus, an impairment may be found \u201c\u2018not severe\u2019 only if the evidence establishes a slight 17 abnormality . . . [ that has] \u2018no more than a minimal effect on an individual\u2019s ability to work.\u2019\u201d  \nNewell , 347 F.3d at 546 (citation omitted).  Neely bears the burden of showing at step two that \nhe has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments, see Bowen , 482 U.S. at  \n146 n.5; a ny doubt as to whether this showing has been made is to be resolved in his favor, \nNewell , 347 F.3d at  546; see also McCrea v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 (3d Cir. \n2004).4 \nb. Whether the ALJ Failed to Consider the Complete M ental \nHealth Exam Findings Contained in the Medical Records as to \nNeely\u2019s Depression  \n \nNeely\u2019s first step two argument is that, when the ALJ was evaluating Neely\u2019s depression, \nthe ALJ f ailed to \u201cconsider the complete mental exam findings contained in the me dical \nrecords [.]\u201d  (D.I. 13 at 12- 14)  Neely recognizes that in her step two decision, the ALJ did cite to \nthe medical records of Neely\u2019s therapist, Mr. Tomaszewicz.  ( Id. at 13; see also  Tr. at 46)  But \nhere, Neely specifically points to the ALJ\u2019s conclus ion that he had only a \u201cmild\u201d limitation \n \n4  Because the claims at issue here were filed after March 27, 2017, the ALJ did not \nneed to defe r to or give any specific evidentiary weight  (including controlling weight ) to any \nmedical opinion, including opinions from Neely\u2019s medical sources  like Mr. Tomaszewicz.   See  \n20 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c , 404.1527, 416.920c  & 416.927;  see also  Jones v. Kijakazi , Civil Action \nNo. 20- 1074- SRF, 2022 WL 1016610, at *8 (D. Del. Apr. 5, 2022).  Instead, the ALJ must \nconsider the persuasiveness of all medical opinions based on the application of five factors:  (1) supportability; (2) consistency; (3) relationship with the claimant; (4) specialization; and (5) other factors  that tend to support or contradict the  opinion.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(c)  & \n416.920c(c);  Weidner v. Kijakazi , Civil Action No. 20- 1250- MN, 2022 WL 610702, at *11 (D. \nDel. Feb. 1, 2022), report and recommendation adopted 2022 WL 610678 (D. Del. Feb. 16, 2022) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(a)).  \u201cThe ALJ must explain how [s]he considered the most important factors  of supportability and consistency.\u201d   Weidner , 2022 WL 610702, at *11 (citing \n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2)).  \u201cConsistency concerns the degree to which the opinion reflects \nthe same limitations described in evidence from other sources, whereas supportabilit y concerns \nthe relevancy of objective medical evidence and degree of explanation given by the medical source to support the limitations assessed in the opinion.\u201d   Id. (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted) ).  18 regarding \u201cconcentrating, persisting or maintaining pace\u201d ; Neely  argues that  the ALJ erred in \ncoming to that conclusion, because the ALJ failed to consider the entirety of Mr. Tomaszewicz\u2019s \nrecords , which show that his limitations  in this area were more than \u201cmild.\u201d   (D.I. 13 at 13- 14 \n(\u201cThe totality of [ the] evidence demonstrates that Mr. Neely\u2019s mental health impairments were \nmore than slight abnormalities and impacted his ability to perform basic work activities, e.g. maintaining concentration, persistence and pace.\u201d) )   \nIn support  of his argument , Neely points out, ( id. at 13 -14), that Mr. Tomaszewicz \ndescribed him  as being depressed, irritable and anxious.  ( See, e.g ., Tr. at 9 90)  And that is true.  \nBut as the ALJ mentioned in her decisi on, in the portion of Mr. Tomaszewicz\u2019 s records that seem \nto most directly relate to the issue of \u201cconcentrating, persisting or maintaining pace\u201d \u2014i.e., the \nsection  labeled \u201cAttention Span and Concentration\u201d \u2014the therapist  wrote that Neely\u2019s attention \nspan and concentra tion w ere \u201calert\u201d and \u201cintact[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 46; see also id . at 978, 983, 989)   That \nkind of notation supports the ALJ\u2019s decision here . \nMoreover, the ALJ explained why, as a more general matter, she felt that Mr. \nTomaszewicz\u2019 s depression -related medical opinion ( e.g., that Neely had a \u201cmoderate severe \ndegree of impairment\u201d in certain areas,  (see id . at 996-97)), was \u201c not persuasive , as it is not \nsupported by mental health records  and is inconsistent with other medical evidence of record.\u201d  \n(Id. at 46)  In this regard, t he ALJ noted\u2014citing to Mr. Tomaszewicz\u2019s own records \u2014that \nNeely \u2019s \u201cmental status exam findings have remained within normal limits.\u201d  ( Id. (citing Tr.  at \n977-78, 990))   And indeed, there are notations in Mr. Tomaszewicz\u2019s records (in addition to \nthose already described above) that could support this conclusion.  Those include  that:  (1) \nNeely\u2019s mental status exams revealed he had intact recent and remote memory ; (2) his  \npsychomotor behavior was \u201cwithin normal limits[;]\u201d (3) his orientation to time, place and person 19 was \u201cwithin normal limits[;]\u201d (4) his fund of knowledge was \u201cwithin normal limits[;]\u201d (5) his \njudgment and insight w ere \u201cwithin normal limits[ ;]\u201d and ( 6) while the c ontent of his thought \nprocesses was  \u201cscattered\u201d it w as also \u201cclear, logical [and] relevant[,]\u201d and he was thinking with \n\u201cintact\u201d associations and at a \u201cnormal\u201d rate and rhythm.  ( Id. at 978- 79, 983- 84, 989- 90)  \nMoreover, Neely was never hospitalized during the relevant time period and was not \nparticipating in psychotherapy.  ( Id. at 976, 984, 990)5   \nIn light of all of this, there is  substantial evidence  to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that \nNeely\u2019s depression was not severe\u2014that is, that his depression, standing alone, amounted to a \n\u201cslight abnormality\u201d that had \u201cno more than a minimal effect on [Neely\u2019s] ability to work.\u201d  \nNewell , 347 F.3d at 546 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .  To be sure, Mr. \nTomaszewicz held a different vi ew.  But the ALJ cited evidence from M r. Tomaszewicz\u2019s own \nmedical records  that can be read to contradict th at view.  Th is evidence amounted to \u201c more than \na mere scintilla\u201d ; it was enough evidence for a \u201creasonable mind\u201d to accept as \u201cadequate to \nsupport \u201d the ALJ\u2019s conclusion in this regard.  See Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, 1154 \n(2019) .  That is all that is required.  Cf.  Charlier v. Kijakazi , C.A. No. 20- 1327- CFC -JLH, 2 022 \nWL 606327, at *3 (D. Del. Feb. 28, 2022) , report and recommendation adopted 2022 WL \n1770336 (D. Del. June 1, 2022)  (holding that the ALJ\u2019s finding that the claimant\u2019s depression \n \n5  Although the ALJ did not specifical ly cite to Neely\u2019s hearing testimony during the \nstep two portion of her decision, it is notable that during that testimony, Neely did not provide \nmuch in the way of evidence as to how his depression actually impact ed his ability to \nconcentrate, persist or maintain pace during the workday.  There was a point at the hearing when \nNeely\u2019s counsel did ask  him about the issue of concentration:  \u201cSo, you\u2019ve been through some \nissues, and do you [and Mr. Tomaszewicz]  talk about your pain and how it affects your abilit y to \nconcentrate[?]\u201d  (Tr. at 91)  But to that, Neely simply responded that he and Mr. Tomaszewicz discuss  \u201cmost of all sleeping and [that Mr. Tomaszewicz has] i ndicated that I have high anxiety \nthat puts me to sleep at night.\u201d  ( Id.)   20 was not severe was supported by substantial evidence , where the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s \nown statements about his depression and certain medical opinion evidence cited by the p laintiff , \nbut then discounted that evidence as inconsistent  with other portions of the record\u2014such as \nmental status exams that showed that the plaintiff had \u201c appropriate mood and affect, normal \njudgment and insight, and intact recent and remote memory\u201d) ; Strogish v.

Dec. 16, 2008) (finding that the ALJ appropriately \ndiscounted a treating physician\u2019s opinion regarding the severity of the claim ant\u2019s depression, in \npart because the physician\u2019s opinion was contradicted by his own treatment notes) .   \nc. Whether the ALJ Fail ed to Consider Neely\u2019s Written \nTestimony  \n \nNeely next argues that the ALJ \u201c failed to consider [Neely\u2019s]  written testimony \u201d during \nher step two analysis.  (D .I. 13 at 12, 14)  Here, Neely is referring to the fact that o n April 24, \n2018, at the same time as he submitted his DIB application, Neely  filled out a \u201cFunction Report \n\u2014 Adult\u201d for the SSA.  (Tr. at 212- 19)  In that document, Neely c omplained that he had \ndifficulty sleeping and was unable to participate in social gatherings or spend time with others.  (Id. at 213, 216, 217 ( cited in  D.I. 13 at 14) )  He  also wrote that he  felt like he was unable to \nfinish what he started due to lack of sleep, and that he did not handle changes to his routine very \nwell.  ( Id. at 217-18 (cited in  D.I. 13 at 14) )   \nIn the portion of her decision that discussed Neely\u2019s mental health issues, the ALJ did not \nexplicitly cite to Neely\u2019s 2018 written testimony .\n6  And nowhere in that portion of the decision \n \n6  That said,  in describing in her decision why Neely had no limitations in the \nfunctional area of \u201cadapting or managing oneself[,]\u201d the ALJ noted (without citation) that Neely \n\u201ctestified that he is able to perform personal care and tries to do household chores.\u201d  (Tr. at 46)  During his administrative hearing, Neely did not really discuss these subjects.  ( Id. at 62- 97)  But \nin his 2018 written testimony, Neely did explain how he engaged in some personal care and 21 did the ALJ make reference to the parts of that written testimony that Neely cites to here on \nappeal.   But the Court does not agree that this  fact\u2014at least as  it relates to the ALJ\u2019s decision \nthat Neely\u2019s depression, standing alone, was not a severe impairment \u2014amounts to reversable \nerror.7  The ALJ\u2019s decision as to the severity of Neely\u2019s depression w as supported by substantial \nevidence, as was discussed above .  Even if Neely\u2019s written testimony from April 2018 could be \nsaid to amount to some evidence supporting a contrary conclusion on that point, \u201c [t]he presence \nof [such contrary] evidence . . . does not undermine the [ALJ\u2019s] decision so long as the record \nprovides substantial support for that decision.\u201d  Malloy  v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 306 Fed. App\u2019x \n761, 764 (3d Cir. 2009) ; see also  Rutherford, 399 F.3d at 553 (noting that remand is not required \nwhen it would not affect the outcome of a case) .  Thus, the Court does not conclude that this \nargument  independently warrants relief.   \nd. Whether the ALJ Failed  to Consider All of Neely\u2019s Mental \nImpairments  \n \n \nperformed certain chores around the house.  (Id. at 213- 15)  So the ALJ\u2019s reference in the \ndecision to what Neely \u201ctestified\u201d about in this regard could have been a reference to the 2018 \nwritten testimony.  \n \n7  As will be noted below, Neely raises \u2014as a separate issue on appeal \u2014the fact that \nthe ALJ failed to conside r his diagnoses of insomnia and anxiety disorder.  In light of this, the \nCourt has considered this issue (regarding the ALJ\u2019s failure to credit certain of Neely\u2019s 2018 written testimony) solely as it relates to the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Neely\u2019s depression was not a severe impairment.  In other words, here the Court is simply concluding that if depression had \nbeen the only mental health condition that Neely had faced in the relevant time period, then the  \nALJ\u2019s failure to credit Neely\u2019s  2018 written testimony  would not have been sufficient to overturn \nthe ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Neely\u2019s depression was non- severe.  \n However, a s is further set out below, the Court has also concluded that the case should be \nremanded so that the Commissioner can fully consider the im pact of Neely\u2019s insomnia and \nanxiety disorder ( together with his other impairments) in the disability calculus.  It may be that \nwhen the Commissioner does so, portions of Neely\u2019s 2018 written testimony will be relevant and/or helpful to the Commissioner\u2019s anal ysis.  Nothing in this portion of the opinion is meant to \nsuggest otherwise.  22 Neely \u2019s next argument relates to the fact that Mr. Tomaszewicz not only diagnosed him \nas suffering from de pression, but also from, inter alia , insomnia and generalized anxiety \ndisorder.  ( See, e.g., Tr. at 991)  However , the only mental health condition that the ALJ \nspecifically addressed in her decision was Neely \u2019s depression.  ( Id. at 46)  Because the  ALJ\u2019s \n\u201cdecision is silent [as to] how she considered [Neely\u2019s] anxiety disorder and insomnia\u201d and \nbecause these two \u201cimpairments [allegedly] contribute to his  inability to sustain work [,]\u201d Neely \nasserts that the ALJ\u2019s failure to consider them amounted to reversable error.  (D.I. 13 at 14; see also id. at 12)  Here, the Court agrees with Neely.  \n\u201cAn ALJ is required to consider impairments a claimant says he has, or about which the \nALJ receives evidence.\u201d  Rutherford, 399 F.3d at  552 (quoting Skarbek v. Barnhart , 390 F.3d \n500, 504 (7th Cir. 2004) ).  A claimant may alert the ALJ to the fact that an impairment is alleged \nto be severe either in his disability application or at the administrative hearing; even if he does \nnot do so by either of these means, if th e claimant\u2019s medical records otherwise contain sufficient \nreference to the impairment, then the ALJ should consider that impairment in the benefits decision .  See Rutherford , 399 F.3d at 552- 53; Eskridge v. Astrue , 569 F. Supp. 2d 424, 438- 39 \n(D. Del. 2008) (noting that while the \u201c plaintiff did not list obesity on his disability application \nform [,] nor did he testify that he was obese at his hearing before the ALJ [,]\u201d notwithstanding \nthis, \u201cthe ALJ is required to consider all impairments that plaintiff raises or submits into the \nrecord [,]\u201d and concluding that because the plaintiff\u2019s weight was referenced in his medical \nrecord repeatedly , this w as sufficient to alert the ALJ of  that impairment); see also  Daniels v. \nKijakazi , CIVIL ACTION NO. 20 -4240, 2022 WL 1289127, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 29, 2022); \nMiller v. Colvin , 193 F. Supp. 3d 467, 480 (E.D. Pa. 2016)  (same) . 23 Neely did not reference his insomnia or anxiety disorder  (or any other mental health \ncondition) in his applications for benefits.  (D. I. 16 at 6)   But he did make  some  reference to \nthose conditions at the administrative hearing.  This is probably easiest to see with regard to \nNeely\u2019s insomnia, so the Court will primarily address that condition here.  During the hearing, \nNeely\u2019s attorney questioned him about this issue:  \nQ[:]  And . . . do you have a recollection of reporting to [Dr. \nTucker] that because of pain, you were having a hard time sleeping?  \n A[:]  Yes.  That\u2019s correct.  \n Q[:]  Okay.  Do you still have a hard time sleeping due to pa in? \n A[:]  Yes, I do.  \n Q[:]  Okay.  How many hours a night do you sleep?  \n A[:]  Only four to three.  \n Q[:]  Three to four hours.  \n A[:]  Yes.  \n Q[:]  Do you have to sleep during the day?  \n A[:]  Yes, I do, at times.  \n \n(Tr. at 87)  Neely  went on to explain that he was only able to sleep for a few hours or so during \nthe day .  (Id.)  He also  noted that Mr. Tomaszewicz had  prescribed him some medication due to \nthis difficulty with sleeping \u2014but this medication created  other problems, as it caused Neely to \nsleep so deeply  at night that he would urinate and not easily wake up.  ( Id. at 90- 91) \nMoreover, the records from Neely\u2019s visits with Mr. Tomaszewicz  make manifest the \nexistence of these conditions.  As to Neely\u2019s insomnia,  for example,  the records show  that Mr. \nTomaszewicz formally diagnosed Neely with that condition and prescribed him Z aleplon to treat 24 it at bedtime.  ( See, e.g., i d. at 990- 91)  The records also discuss related symptoms, some of \nwhich seem significant  to Neely\u2019s ability to work .  For e xample, in the records, Neely describes \nhow:  (1) he falls asleep at \u201c2  or 3 AM\u201d on a recliner and gets \u201cone and a half hours of sleep\u201d \nthen \u201cwake[s] up for two hours\u201d and the \u201ccycle repeats day and night\u201d ; (2) he is \u201ctired, [has] no \nenergy, and[ , relatedly, is ] irritable all the time\u201d; (3) he \u201ccan\u2019t fall asleep\u201d at night in part due to \npain; and (4) during one of his visits with  Mr. Tomaszewicz, he fell asleep in the waiting room.  \n(See, e.g., id . at 989 (internal quotation marks omitted) )  And i n his Psychological Functional \nCapacity report, Mr. Tomaszewicz described how \u201cchanges in sleep lead[ing] to fatigue\u201d and \n\u201cdifficul[ty] control[ing] insomnia\u201d and lack of \u201cimprov[ment in] his sleep\u201d were all factors \nindicating that Neely could not work reg ularly.  ( Id. at 995, 997)8    \nIn sum, the ALJ erred in failing to consider at step two whether Neely\u2019s insomnia and \nanxiety disorder amount to severe impairments.9  Even if the impairments were found to be non-\nsevere, they may have imposed additional re strictions on Neely\u2019s ability to work, but because \nthey were not considered, the ALJ did not explore that issue as well.  Without the ALJ\u2019s analysis \nof these two conditions, the Court cannot conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by \nsubstantial evid ence.  See  Woodson v. Saul , Civil Action No. 18- 1928- RGA, 2020 WL 1506281, \n \n8  Although less pronounced, Neely did make some reference to his anxiety during \nthe administrative hearing.  (Tr. at 91 (noting that Mr. Tomaszewicz \u201cindicated that I have high \nanxiety that puts me to sleep at night\u201d))  And in Mr. Tomaszewicz\u2019s records:  (1) Neely is described as being formally diagnose d with \u201c[g]eneralized anxiety disorder\u201d; (2) it is noted that \nNeely is prescribed medicine for this disorder; and (3) Neely makes reference to his anxiety (\u201cI am anxious in the morning.\u201d).  ( See, e.g., id . at 989, 991 (internal quotation marks omitted))  \n \n9  Although Neely clearly raised this issue in his opening brief, (D.I. 13 at 12- 14), \nthe Commissioner did not discuss it at all in her  answering brief, (D.I. 16).  (D.I. 18 at 3 (Neely \nnoting that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s argument is silent about this failure\u201d))  \n 25 at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 30, 2020) ( concluding that the ALJ erred a t step two, requiring remand, by \nfailing to address the plaintiff\u2019s bipolar disorder, where the plaintiff had been diagnosed with that \ndisorder by two different treating medical providers); Kirk v. Saul , C.A. No. 20- 245-LPS, 2021 \nWL 2823122, at *2 (D. Del. July 7, 2021) ( concluding the  same, where the claimant asserted at \nthe administrative hearing that his depression and anxiety were impairments  and the record \ncontained supporting evidence, but where the ALJ nevertheless did not determine whether these conditions \u201c rose to the level of disability\u201d) ; Scott v. Saul , Civil Action No. 1:17- 1659, 2019 WL \n3817508, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 14, 2019)  (concluding that  because the plaintiff\u2019s medical records \nindicated that she had generalized anxiety disorder, and because those records were readily available to the ALJ, the ALJ\u2019s failure to specifically consider that condition at step two required remand, because the Court could not know whether the ALJ would have considered this to be a severe impairment ).    \nTherefore, this issue will require remand o f this case for further proceedings , so that the \nCommissioner can determine whether Neely\u2019s insomnia and anxiety disorder amount to severe impairments  (and the extent to which any restrictions imposed by those impairments affect \nNeely\u2019s ability to perform  relevant  work ).   \ne. Whether the ALJ Failed to Consider the Cumulative Effect of \nNeely\u2019s Mental Impairments in Combination with his Pain and Fatigue  \n \nNeely  next  argues that the ALJ erred by failing to consider the cumulative effect of \nNeely\u2019s mental impairments  in combination with his pain and fatigue  when making the severity \nassessment .  (D.I. 13 at 14- 15)  This argument is a close cousin of the last one, and ag ain the \nCourt agrees that it has merit.  \u201c [F]ailure to recognize a mental illness necessarily means that the \nALJ did not consider whether the cumulative effect of an additional mental illness would change 26 the ALJ\u2019s impression of the severity of [a p] laintiff\u2019s limitations.\u201d  Woodson, 2020 WL 1506281, \nat *2 ; see also  Scott , 2019 WL  3817508, at  *5 (noting that  in such  circumstances,  an ALJ\u2019s \nopinion \u201cfails to consider [ that] the cumulative effect of multiple mental illnesses  could change \nthe ALJ\u2019s impression of the severity of [the claimant\u2019s] limitations\u201d  and that had the ALJ \nconsidered both the assessed and unassessed mental health conditions together, the ALJ \u201cmight \nhave concluded that [ the claimant ] has more than a mild limitatio n in one of the four \u2018paragraph \nB\u2019 areas\u201d) .10   \nThus, remand of the case is also required  for this additional reason\u2014i.e., so that the \nCommissioner can consider whether the limitations associated with Neely\u2019s anxiety disorder and \ninsomnia, considered in combination with the limitations associated with Neely\u2019s other \nimpairments, affect the severity determination .11  \n2.  The ALJ \u2019s Failure to Consider Neely\u2019s Credibly Established \nLimitations  \n \nNeely \u2019s final argument on appeal  is that the ALJ erred in her RFC determination by \nfailing to include all of Neely\u2019s credibly established limitations \u2014more specifically, certain \nlimitations relating to Neely\u2019s mental health limitations .  (D.I. 13 at 16)   \n \n10  Again, Neely clearly raised this issue in his opening brief and cited to cases like \nWoodson and Scott  in support.  (D.I. 13 at 14-15)  And again, the Commissioner did not discuss \nthe issue in her  answering brief,  nor did she address Woodson or Scott .  (D.I. 16).   \n \n11  The Commissioner appears to contend that any error at step two was harmless \nbecause the ALJ proceeded through the remaining steps of the analysis and did not merely stop \nat step two.  The Court rejects this argument.  By failing to consider Neely\u2019s insomnia and \nanxiety order at step two, the ALJ necessarily did not consider whether these were severe impairments that alone, or in conjunction with other of Neely\u2019s impairments, rendered him \ndisabled.  It is possible, for example, that these impairments could have been deemed severe, and \nthat related limitations could have resulted in a  step four RFC determination that would \nultimately lead to a disability determination at step five.  See Kirk , 2021 WL 2823122, at *2 n.1 \n(internal citations omitted); see also  (D.I. 13 at 15-16).   27 The Third Circuit has stated that \u201ca hypothetical question posed to a vocational expert \nmust reflect all  of a claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d  Rutherford, 399 F.3d at  554 (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted) (emphasis in original) .  \u201cReliance on an expert\u2019s answer to a \nhypothetical question will not constitute  substantial evidence unless all credibly established \nlimitations  are included; remand is required where  the hypothetical question is deficient.\u201d  \nLayfield v. Colvin , Civil Action No. 15- 358-SLR-SRF, 2016 WL 4578327, at *13 (D. Del. Sept. \n1, 2016) (citing Rutherford, 399 F.3d at 554) , report and recommendation adopted 2016 WL \n5213902 (D. Del. Sept. 20, 2016) .  This includes limitations stemming from medically supported \nimpairments that are both severe and non- severe.  Weidner , 2022 WL 610702, at *9; Woodson, \n2020 WL 1506281, at *3 .  An ALJ must include credibly established limitations in both the \nhypothetical question posed to the VE and in her  RFC assessment.  See Watson v. Saul , C.A. No. \n18-880 ( MN), 2020 WL 2737012, at *10- 11 (D. Del. May 26, 2020).  The  Third Circuit has \nprovided guidance on when a limitation is \u201ccredibly established[ :]\u201d \nLimitations that are medically supported and otherwise \nuncontroverted in the record, but that are not included in the \nhypothetical question posed to the expert, preclude reliance on the \nexpert \u2019s response. . . .  Relatedly, the ALJ may not substitute his or  \nher own expertise to refute such record evidence. . . .  Limitations \nthat are medically supported but are also contradicted by other \nevidence in the record may or may not be found credible \u2014the ALJ \ncan choose to credit portions of the existing evidence but  cannot \nreject evidence for no reason or for the wrong reason. . . .  Finally, \nlimitations that are asserted by the claimant but that lack objective \nmedical support may possibly be considered nonetheless credible.  \nIn that respect the ALJ can reject such a limitation if there is \nconflicting evidence in the record, but should not reject a claimed \nsymptom that is related to an impairment and is consistent with the \nmedical record simply because there is no objective medical \nevidence to support it.  \n \nRutherford, 399 F.3d at  554 (internal quotation marks  and citations omitted) .   28 In coming to the conclusion that Neely\u2019s depression was non- severe, the ALJ found that \nNeely suffered \u201cmild \u201d limitations in two of the four broad areas of mental functioning:  (1) \ninteracting with others and (2) concentrating, persisting or maintaining pace.  ( D.I. 13 at 17; Tr. \nat 46)  Neely argues that the ALJ failed to consider these two \u201cmild\u201d limitations whe n making \nher RFC determination or in posing the hypothetical questions  to the  VE.  (D.I. 13 at 17; Tr. at \n46-47, 94- 95)  As such, Neely asserts that a remand is required.  (D.I. 13 at 16)  For her part, the \nCommissioner argues , without any further explanat ion, that the ALJ \u201cincluded all of Plaintiff\u2019s \nlimitations that were supported by the evidence. . . .  The evidence did not support a finding that \nPlaintiff required additional limitations.\u201d  (D.I. 16 at 7)  \n The Court concludes that the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment and hypothetical questions  were \ndeficient  as a matter of law .  Despite finding that Neely suffered from mild limitations due to his \ndepression, the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment /hypothetical questions  did not include reference to those \nlimitations (or in deed, to any limitations that were related to Neely\u2019s depression ).  Given the \nALJ\u2019s finding that Neely suffered from some medically determinable depression -related \nlimitations (even if \u201cmild\u201d), the ALJ was required to address  those limitation s in the RFC \nassessment /hypothetical  questions \u2014or, at the very least, to make reference to th e limitations  at \nthis step and then expla in her reasons for failing to include them  in the RFC \nassessment/hypothetical questions .  The ALJ failed to explicitly do so, (Tr. at 4 7-51; 94- 96), \nwhich amounts to reversable error.  See  Snider  v. Saul , Civil Action No. 19 -1907- MN-SRF,  2021 \nWL 3090870, at *9 (D. Del. July 22, 2021) (\u201cBecause the ALJ found that Snider\u2019s non- severe \nanxiety, adjustment disorder, and depression were medically supported, and because he \nacknowledged mild limitations in connection with her anxiety, adjustment disorder, and \ndepression, \u2018the ALJ had a duty to address those limitations in the RFC assessment and the 29 hypothetical question posed to the VE.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Moore v.

Snider , 2021 WL 3090870, \nat *9 ; Layfield , 2016 WL 4578327, at *14.  The VE categorized Neely\u2019s past employment as a \nclosing clerk as a skilled position at SVP 5, and his prior work as a billing clerk as a semi -skilled  \nposition at SVP 4.
