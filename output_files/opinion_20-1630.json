Taylor, \nHUSCH BLACKWELL LLP, Denver, CO; \nAttorneys for Defendant Health Net. \nJanuary 4, 2022 \nPage 1 of 12 'ltc:il;,~, \nI referred this very interesting case to a magistrate judge. (D .I. 16). She wrote a Report \nand Recommendation on three pending motions to dismiss. (D.1. 64). Defendants filed \nobjections (D.I. 70, 71), to which Plaintiffs responded (D.I. 77, 78). There is even an amicus \nbrief. (D.1. 75). I heard oral argument on October 14, 2021. For the following reasons, I will \nADOPT-IN-PART the Report and Recommendation. (D.1. 64). Hikma's motion to dismiss the \nFirst Amended Complaint (D.I. 19) is GRANTED. Hikma's motion to dismiss the original \ncomplaint (D.I. 11) is DISMISSED AS MOOT. Health Net's motion to dismiss the First \nAmended Complaint (D.1. 30) is DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs sued Defendants for induced infringement of three patents that describe \nmethods of using icosapent ethyl for the reduction of cardiovascular risk. (D.I. 17). Plaintiffs \nmanufacture and sell VASCEPA , a branded version of icosapent ethyl. (Id. at ,r,r 1, 57-58). \nDefendant Hikma is a generic manufacturer of icosapent ethyl. (Id. at ,r 1). Defendant Health \nNet is an insurer that provides coverage for Vascepa and Hikma's generic version. (Id. at ,r,r \n139-40). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is \nconsidered a dispositive motion. D. Del. LR 72.l(a)(3). A magistrate judge's Report and \nRecommendation regarding a case-dispositive motion is reviewed de nova. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n72(b)(3). \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6), the Court must accept the complaint's factual allegations as true. See Bell At!. Corp. v. \nPage 2 of 12 Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not \nhave to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, conclusions , or a \"formulaic \nrecitation \" of the claim elements . Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint \nare true (even if doubtful in fact).\"). Moreover , there must be sufficient factual matter to state a \nfacially plausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial \nplausibility standard is satisfied when the complaint 's factual content \"allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. (\"Where a \ncomplaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant 's liability, it stops short of the \nline between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \nSection 271 (b) provides, \"whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be \nliable as an infringer.\" 35. U.S.C. 271(b). To state a claim for induced infringement , the \ncomplaint must allege that there has been direct infringement, that the defendant knowingly \ninduced infringement , and that the defendant has the intent to encourage another 's infringement. \nMEMC Elec. Material s, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp., 420 F.3d 1369, 1378 (Fed. \nCir. 2005). A generic manufacturer can be liable for inducing infringement of a patented method \neven when the generic has attempted to \"carve out\" the patented indications. GlaxoSmithKline \nLLC v. Teva Pharmaceutical s USA, Inc., 7 F.4th 1320, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (per curiam). \nPage 3 of 12 III. IDKMA'S MOTION TO DISMISS \nA. BACKGROUND \nAmarin sells V ascepa (icosapent ethyl) for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia \n(the \"SH indication \") and cardiovascular risk reduction (the \"CV indication\"). (D.I. 17 at ,r,r 1, \n56). Only the CV indication is covered by Plaintiffs ' patents. (See D.I. 22 at 1). Hikma \nreceived FDA approval to sell a generic version for the SH indication under the \"skinny label\" or \n\"section viii carveout\" regime. (D.I. 17 at ,r,r 11, 95, 108). This regime allows a generic to \nsidestep the typical FDA requirement that a generic's labeling is the same as the brand's \nlabeling. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(viii). The generic does so by removing the portions of the \nlabel associated with the patented use, resulting in a \"skinny label.\" Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendant Hikma's label is \"not-skinny-enough\" and that the label, along with Hikma's public \nstatements, induce infringement of Plaintiffs' patents for the CV indication. (D.I. 22 at 1). \nB. DISCUSSION \n1. The Federal Circuit's GSK Decision \nTwo days after the Report issued, the Court of Appeals issued the most recent \nauthoritative opinion concerning skinny labels, albeit after the case was fully litigated in the \ndistrict court. See GlaxoSmithKline LLC v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. [hereinafter \n\"GSIC], 7 F.4th 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Federal Circuit affirmed a jury's findings that Teva's \n\"partial label\" induced infringement of GSK's patent, notwithstanding Teva's attempt to exclude \nthe patented use from its label under the skinny label regime. (Id. at 1338). Ultimately, the \nFederal Circuit concluded , \"Teva's partial label did not successfully carve out the patented use, \nand thus, Teva was selling its generic with a label which infringed the method claim.\" Id. \nAccordingly, Teva's label was \"not a skinny label.\" Id. at 1328. \nPage 4 of 1 ~ The Federal Circuit also found that two Teva press releases supported the jury's verdict. \nId. at 1335-37. The first press release advertised Teva's drug as \"indicated for treatment of heart \nfailure\" and did \"not parse between congestive heart failure [the patented indication] or post-MI \nL VD [an unpatented indication]. \" Id. at 1336. The second press release stated that Teva \nreceived approval to market \"its Generic version of GlaxoSmithKline ' s cardiovascular agent \nCoreg.\" Id. Expert testimony established that the phrase \"'cardiovascular agent' 'indicated to \ndoctors they could use Teva's carvedilol 'for all indications ,' including heart failure.\" Id. \nThe Court held that GSK is a \"narrow, case-specific review\" and that it is still the law that \n\"generics could not be held liable for merely marketing and selling under a 'skinny' label \nomitting all patented indications , or for merely noting (without mentioning any infringing uses) \nthat FDA had rated a product as therapeutically equivalent to a brand-name drug.\" Id. at 1326. \nAn \"AB rating,\" as the complaint explains, \"reflects a decision [by the FDA] that a generic drug \nis therapeutically equivalent to a branded drug when the generic drug is used as labeled[.]\" (D.I. \n17 at, 98). As GSK's discussion of Teva's press releases illustrates , where a generic label does \nnot effectively carve out a patented use, advertisement that the drug is \"AB rated\" can support a \nfinding of inducement. GSK, 7 F.4th at 1335. \n2. Amarin's Complaint \nAmarin' s complaint pleads several factual allegations in support of its claim that Hikma \ninduces infringement . These allegations fall into two categories: Hikma's label and Hikma's \npublic statements. The Magistrate Judge recommends I deny Hikma's motion to dismiss because \n\"several ... portions of Hikma's label, taken together with Hikma's public statements, instruct \nphysicians to use Hikma's product in a way that infringes the asserted patents.\" (D.I. 64 at 12). \nPage 5 of 12 The bulk of the briefing and oral argument was directed to Hikma's label, and I will address \nthose arguments first. \nAs to the label, Hikma objects that Arnarin's complaint fails to plead instruction as to at \nleast two claim limitations-the requirement that icosapent ethyl be administered to reduce CV \nrisk and the requirement to co-administer with a statin. (D.I. 71 at 7-8). Because I agree with \nHikma that there has been no instruction as to CV risk reduction , I will not address Hikma's \nargument regarding co-administration with a statin. \nArnarin contends that Hikma's label teaches CV risk reduction for two reasons. First, \nHikma's label contains a notice regarding side effects for patients with CV disease. (D.I. 78 at 5-\n6). Second, Hikma's label does not \"state that Hikma's 'generic version' of VASCEPA should \nnot be used for the CV Indication or that the effect of icosapent ethyl on cardiovascular mortality \nand morbidity in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined\" (the \"CV \nlimitation\"). (D.I. 17 at ,r,r 108, 121). Hikma responds that (1) the notice regarding side effects \nis a warning and thus not an instruction to use icosapent ethyl to reduce cardiovascular risk, and \n(2) the removal of the CV risk reduction limitation is mere silence and that Hikma has no duty to \ndiscourage infringing use. \nRegarding the warning as to side effects, I agree with Hikma. The label states, \n\"Icosapent ethyl may cause serious side effects, including: ... Heart rhythm problems which can \nbe serious and cause hospitalization have happened in people who take icosapent ethyl, \nespecially in people who have heart (cardiovascular) disease or diabetes with a risk factor for \nheart (cardiovascular) disease[.]\" (D.I. 17, Ex.Kat 12-13 of 15). This is hardly instruction or \nencouragement. See, e.g., Otsuka Pharm. Co. v. Torrent Pharms. Ltd., 99 F. Supp. 3d 461,490 \n(D.N.J. 2015) (\"[A] warning is just that-a warning. It is not an instruction[.]\") . \nPage 6 of 12 Amarin also argues that Hikma \"removed\" 1 the CV limitation from its label, which would \nbe \"understood in the field to teach that Hikma's product has been proven to reduce CV risk and \nto encourage its use for that purpose\" because other drugs in the same class have not been shown \nto reduce CV risk. (D.I. 78 at 4). This amounts to an \"affirmative statement \" that it can be used \nfor cardiovascular risk reduction , according to Plaintiffs. (D.I. 85 at 62:16-62:5 ). \nThe Federal Circuit has previously rejected the argument that generic labels must contain \na \"clear statement \" discouraging use of the patented indication. Takeda Pharms. US.A., Inc. v. \nW-Ward Pharm. Corp., 785 F.3d 625,632 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Plaintiffs must plead that \n\"Hikma took affirmative steps to induce, not affirmative steps to make sure others avoid \ninfringement. \" Id. Even if Plaintiffs are right that Hikma's label's silence regarding CV risk \nreduction communicates to the public that icosapent ethyl can be used to reduce CV risk, \n\"merely describing an infringing mode is not the same as recommending , encouraging , or \npromoting an infringing use.\" Id. at 631 ( cleaned up). I therefore find that the lack of a CV \nlimitation on Hikma's label does not plausibly teach CV risk reduction. \nSince I find that the label does not instruct CV risk reduction , the question is whether \nHikma' s public statements , including press releases and Hikma' s website, induce infringement. \n(D.I. 17 at ,r 127). Hikma's press releases state that its product is the \"generic equivalent to \nV ascepa\u00ae\" and that \"Vascepa is a prescription medicine that is indicated , in part, as an adjunct \nto diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (~500 mg/dL) \n1 Hikma contests Plaintiffs ' use of the word \"removal,\" noting, \"Amarin removed the limitation \nof use from Vascepa's label before Hikma launched its product, and Hikma was required to use \n'the same [labeling] as the labeling approved for the listed drug.\"' (D .I. 71 at 7 n.2 ( citing 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(v))). The facts pled in the complaint state that the removal happened \nduring the FDA approval process. (D.I. 17 at ,r 108). At any rate, it appears that there is no \nallegation that Hikma's product was ever marketed with a label containing the CV limitation. \nPage 7 of 12 hypertriglyceridemia. According to IQVIA, US sales ofVascepa \u00ae were approximately $919 \nmillion in the 12 months ending February 2020.\" (Id. at ,r 112). The sales figures cited by \nHikma include Vascepa's sales of the patented indication. The complaint further alleges that \nHikma's website states that Hikma's generic is \"AB rated\" in the \"Therapeutic Category : \nHypertriglyceridemia. \" (Id. at ,r 125). \nHikma' s press releases might be relevant to intent but they do not support actual \ninducement. Hikma' s advertising of icosapent ethy 1 as the \"generic equivalent \" of V ascepa does \nnot expose Hikma to liability. GSK, 7 F.4th at 1335 n.7. The citation ofVascepa 's sales figures \ngo to Hikma's intent to induce. Intent alone is not enough; Amarin must plead an inducing act. \nAmarin also alleges that Hikma's website induces infringement by advertising its \nproduct in the therapeutic category \"hypertriglyceridemia. \" The complaint pleads, \n\"hypertriglyceridemia ... does not match and is broader than the Indications and Usage sections \nof Hikma' s Label, which includes only Severe Hypertriglyceridemia Indication (i.e., \ntriglycerides 2':500 mg/dL).\" (D.I. 17 at ,r 126). Accepting the facts in the light most favorable to \nAmarin, Amarin has pled that the category \"hypertrigl yceridemia \" includes infringing uses. The \nquestion is whether this is enough, without a label or other public statements instructing as to \ninfringing use, to induce infringement. \nI hold that it is not. This statement does not rise to the level of encouraging , \nrecommending , or promoting taking Hikma's generic for the reduction of CV risk. \nTwo recent Federal Circuit cases are instructive on this point. The GSK majority found \nthat Teva's advertising of\"its Generic version of GlaxoSmithK.line 's cardiovascular agent,\" \nwhen \"cardiovascular agent\" was a category that included both infringing and non-infringing \nuses, supported a jury's finding of inducement. 7 F.4th at 1336. The Court emphasized that: \nPage 8 of 12 Teva did not merely say its drug is a cardiovascular agent, leaving the world to wonder \nabout its uses. It said its product is a generic equivalent of GSK's cardiovascular agent \nCoreg\u00ae. It was reasonable for the jury to conclude , especially in light of the prior press \nrelease that expressly mentioned heart failure, that Teva was again encouraging the \nsubstitution of its product for all of Coreg's\u00ae cardiovascular indications , including as \nclaimed in the '000 patent. \nId. at 1337. In contrast, the Federal Circuit has found that a label indicated for \"[m]oderate to \nsevere chronic pain, \" which included both infringing and non-infringing uses, did \"not \nspecificall y encourage use\" of the generic for the patented treatment. Grunenthal GMBH v. \nAlkem Lab'ys Ltd., 919 F.3d 1333, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"[E]ven if severe chronic pain includes \npolyneuropathic pain, it also includes mononeuropathic pain and nociceptive pain. Therefore , the \nproposed ANDA labels do not specificall y encourage use oftapentadol hydrochloride for \ntreatment of polyneuropathic pain.\"). \nHere, Hikma stated that its product was \"AB Rated'\" in a category that includes both \npatented and non-patented uses. The \"AB rating\" points to the label, as the GSK court explained : \nWe do not hold that an AB rating in a true section viii carve-out (one in which a label \nwas produced that had no infringing indications) would be evidence of inducement. In \nthis case, Teva's representation of AB rating would point physicians to its partial label, \nwhich, for the reasons above, the jury was free to credit as evidence of induced \ninfringement. \nGSK, 7 F.4th at 1335 n.7. Unlike Teva's press release in GSK, Hikma has not pointed to \nVascepa's patented uses in describing itself as Vascepa's generic equivalent. This case is more \nlike Grunenthal , where the broader category simply includes both infringing and non-infringing \nuses, without \"specificall y encourage[ing] \" the use of the generic for the non-infringing uses. \n919 F.3d at 1339. \nSince I find that Amarin's complaint has failed to plead inducement based on Hikma's \nlabel or public statements , I will grant Hikma's motion to dismiss. \nPage 9 of 12 IV. HEAL TH NET'S MOTION TO DISMISS \nA. BACKGROUND \nDefendant Health Net provides insurance coverage for Plaintiffs ' branded Vascepa and \nDefendant Hikma's generic version. According to Plaintiffs , Health Net's formulary placement \ninduces infringement of Plaintiffs ' patents by encouraging the use of Hikma' s generic for the CV \nindication. Health Net's formulary lists Hikma's generic in a lower tier than Amarin's Vascepa, \nresulting in lower copays when a patient opts for Hikma's generic. (D.I. 17 at ,r 143). Since it is \ncommon for pharmacies to automatically substitute an AB-rated generic such as Hikma's for the \nbranded version, Plaintiffs allege that this formulary placement leads to substitution on \"all \nVESCEP A prescriptions , not just the prescriptions directed to the\" SH indication. (Id. at ,r 151 ). \nB. DISCUSSION \nThe Report recommends I deny Health Net's motion to dismiss because there are factual \nquestions regarding whether Health Net has taken an affirmative act to induce infringement and \nwhether Health Net's actions actually cause others to infringe. (D.I. 64 at 17). Health Net \nobjects, \"Plaintiffs fail to allege facts (not conclusions or speculation) supporting a plausible \nconclusion that Health Net was aware of the asserted patents, and once aware, took affirmative \nsteps with the specific intent to induce another 's infringement of those patents-rather than \nmerely acting despite knowledge that others may infringe.\" (D.I. 70 at 2). I disagree. \nI find that the complaint pleads enough facts to plausibly allege knowledge of the \nasserted patents. Amarin sent a pre-suit letter to its point of contact for Health Net. (D.1. 17 at ,r \n87). It is true that the pre-suit letter did not specify the patent numbers. However , the letter \nstates that Amarin has patent exclusivity for the CV indication, and the complaint elsewhere \npleads that the patents associated with the CV indication are readily available through a resource \nPage 10 of12 well-known in the industry, the FDA's Orange Book. (Id at ,r,r 84, 88). Thus, I agree with the \nMagistrate Judge that these facts, taken together in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs , \nmake it plausible that Health Net had specific knowledge of the patents at issue. \nRead in the light most favorable to Amarin, the complaint also plausibly alleges \naffirmative acts taken with a specific intent to induce another's infringement. Formulary \nselection and the prior authorization process, as pled, could be affirmative acts under the law of \ninduced infringement. Health Net argues that the selection of its formulary is automatic , based \non Plaintiffs own pricing as compared to the generic. (D.I. 85 at 75:5-12 (noting that \"this is \ndone by a computer program\")). This may be true, but it is not a shield. Health Net added \ngeneric icosapent ethyl capsules to its formularies . (D.I. 17 at ,r,r 140-143). It is immaterial \nwhether the placement was done by a human or a computer. \nAmarin also plausibly pleads specific intent to induce. At the very least, Health Net's \nprior authorization form supports an inference of specific intent because it lists the patented \nindication on the generic icosapent ethyl capsules form. (D.I. 17 at ,r 159). Health Net's \nplacement of generic icosapent ethyl on a preferred tier encourages the substitution of the generic \nfor the branded drug, including for the patented indication. (Id at ,r,r 145, 151). Together , this is \nenough to plead specific intent to induce. \nIn its objections, Health Net argues that the \"preferred \" language in its formularies cannot \nbe an active step because they are required by state law to disclose which drugs are \"preferred.\" \n(Id at 5). This may be true, but it is not the language of the formulary that is at issue; it is the \nincentives the formulary puts in place. (See id at ,r,r 145, 151). \nHealth Net stresses that they are just a payer, not the physician writing the prescription \nnor the pharmacist making the substitution. (D.I. 70 at 9). As the Report points out, \"It may ... \nPage 11 of 12 tum out that, despite knowledge of infringement by its beneficiaries and their providers , Health \nNet's actions in selecting its formulary and adopting its prior authorization procedure ... do not, \nin fact, influence the decisions of beneficiaries , pharmacists, and medical providers to use, \ndispense, and prescribe Hik:rna's generic product in an infringing way[.]\" (D.I. 64 at 17; see \nWarner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp., 316 F.3d 1348, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (\"[I]f a physician , \nwithout inducement by Apotex, prescribes a use of gabapentin in an infringing manner, Apotex's \nknowledge is legally irrelevant. In the absence of any evidence that Apotex has or will promote \nor encourage doctors to infringe the neurodegenerative method patent, there has been raised no \ngenuine issue of material fact.\")). These are factual questions that cannot be resolved on a \nmotion to dismiss. \nUltimately , I agree with the Magistrate Judge that Plaintiffs have pled enough to proceed \nwith their case against Health Net. \nV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will follow. \nPage 12 of 12 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAMARIN PHARMA , INC., AMARIN \nPHARMACEUTICALS IRELAND \nLIMITED, MOCHIDA PHARMACEUTICAL \nCO.,LTD. \nPlaintiffs; \nV. \nHIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS USA INC., \nHIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC, AND \nHEALTH NET, LLC, \nDefendants.
