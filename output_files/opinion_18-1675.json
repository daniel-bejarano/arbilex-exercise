CONCLUSION .......................................................................................... 76 \nlV COLMF:~LLY \nCHIEF JUDGE \nThis patent infringement case arises out of Defendant Hospira, Inc.'s \nsubmission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the U.S. Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to market a generic version of \nPlaintiffs' Lexiscan\u00ae drug product. Lexiscan\u00ae is a pharmacological agent used in \nmyocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), a type of nuclear stress test. MPI images a \npatient's heart before and after physical stress to determine the effect of stress on \nthe flow of blood through the coronary arteries and the heart. To induce stress, \npatients typically exercise in a controlled fashion on a treadmill or stationary bike \nin the doctor's office during the MPI. When a medical condition prevents the \npatient from exercising, Lexiscan\u00ae can be injected into the patient to stimulate \nstress by widening the patient's blood vessels. The active ingredient (API) in \nLexiscan\u00ae is regadenoson. \nPlaintiffs have asserted three patents. They allege that Hospira's submission \nof its ANDA to the FDA constitutes infringement of claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. \n8,106,183 (the #183 patent) and claim 6 of U.S. Patent No. RE47,301 (the #301 \npatent) pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 27l(e)(2)(A). And they seek a declaratory \njudgment that the manufacture ofHospira's regadenoson product after the FDA's \napproval of the ANDA would constitute direct and induced infringement of claims 1, 2, and 3 of U.S. Patent No. 8,524,883 (the #883 patent) under 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 271(a) and (b ). \nHospira denies infringement and asserts in its defense that the asserted \npatents are invalid. It also filed counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of \nnoninfringement of the asserted patents. \nI held a three-day bench trial, and, as required by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 52(a)(l), I have set forth separately below my findings of fact and \nconclusions of law. \nI. THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nThe ANDA procedures out of which this case arise were established by FDA \nregulations promulgated pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(FDCA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq., and specifically by the so-called Hatch-Waxman \nAmendments to the FDCA. Justice Kagan provided in Caraco Pharmaceutical \nLaboratories, Ltd. v. Novo NordiskAIS, 566 U.S. 399 (2012), this helpful summary \nof the provisions of the Amendments and the FDA regulations that bear on this \ncase: \nThe FDA regulates the manufacture, sale, and labeling of \nprescription drugs under a complex statutory scheme. To \nbegin at the beginning: When a brand manufacturer wishes \nto market a novel drug, it must submit a new drug \napplication (NDA) to the FDA for approval. The NDA \nmust include, among other things, a statement of the \ndrug's components, scientific data showing that the drug \nis safe and effective, and proposed labeling describing the \n2 uses for which the drug may be marketed. The FDA may \napprove a brand-name drug for multiple methods ofuse\u00ad\neither to treat different conditions or to treat the same \ncondition in different ways. \nOnce the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer's drug, \nanother company may seek permission to market a generic \nversion pursuant to legislation known as the Hatch\u00ad\nWaxman Amendments. Those amendments allow a \ngeneric competitor to file an abbreviated new drug \napplication (ANDA) piggy-backing on the brand's NDA. \nRather than providing independent evidence of safety and \nefficacy, the typical ANDA shows that the generic drug \nhas the same active ingredients as, and is biologically \nequivalent to, the brand-name drug. As we have \npreviously recognized, this process is designed to speed \nthe introduction of low-cost generic drugs to market. \nBecause the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that \nwould infringe a patent, the timing of an ANDA's \napproval depends on the scope and duration of the patents \ncovering the brand-name drug. Those patents come in \ndifferent varieties. One type protects the drug compound \nitself. Another kind ... gives the brand manufacturer \nexclusive rights over a particular method of using the drug. \nIn some circumstances, a brand manufacturer may hold \nsuch a method-of-use patent even after its patent on the \ndrug compound has expired. \nTo facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as \npatents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and FDA \nregulations direct brand manufacturers to file information \nabout their patents. The statute mandates that a brand \nsubmit in its NDA the patent number and the expiration \ndate of any patent which claims the drug for which the \nbrand submitted the NDA or which claims a method of \nusing such drug. And the regulations issued under that \nstatute require that, once an NDA is approved, the brand \nprovide a description of any method-of-use patent it holds. \nThat description is known as a use code, and the brand \n3 submits it on FDA Form 3542 .... [T]he FDA does not \nattempt to verify the accuracy of the use codes that brand \nmanufacturers supply. It simply publishes the codes, \nalong with the corresponding patent numbers and \nexpiration dates, in a fat, brightly hued volume called the \nOrange Book (less colorfully but more officially \ndenominated Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic \nEquivalence Evaluations). \nAfter consulting the Orange Book, a company filing an \nANDA must assure the FDA that its proposed generic drug \nwill not infringe the brand's patents. When no patents are \nlisted in the Orange Book or all listed patents have expired \n( or will expire prior to the AND A's approval), the generic \nmanufacturer simply certifies to that effect. Otherwise, \nthe applicant has two possible ways to obtain approval. \n* * * * \n[One of those ways] is to file a so-called paragraph IV \ncertification, which states that a listed patent \"is invalid or \nwill not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of \nthe generic drug.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). A \ngeneric manufacturer will typically take this path in either \nof two situations: if it wants to market the drug for all uses, \nrather than carving out those still allegedly under patent; \nor if it discovers, as described above, that any carve-out \nlabel it is willing to adopt cannot avoid the brand's use \ncode. Filing a paragraph IV certification means provoking \nlitigation. The patent statute treats such a filing as itself \nan act of infringement, which gives the brand an \nimmediate right to sue [under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A)]. \nAssuming the brand does so, the FDA generally may not \napprove the ANDA until 30 months pass or the court finds \nthe patent invalid or not infringed. Accordingly, the \nparagraph IV process is likely to keep the generic drug off \nthe market for a lengthy period, but may eventually enable \nthe generic company to market its drug for all approved \nuses. \n4 566 U.S. at 404-08 (irrelevant citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nII.

The Artisan of Ordinary Skill \n26) \"A court construing a patent claim seeks to accord a claim the \nmeaning it would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the \ninvention.\" Innova/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Sys., 381 F.3d \n1111, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The parties offered at trial competing but similar \ndefinitions of the artisan of ordinary skill to whom the asserted patents are \ndirected. Both parties stated that their positions would not change if the Court \nwere to adopt the other side's definition of a skilled artisan. See D.I. 891-1 ,r 49. \nAccordingly, I will adopt Plaintiffs' proposal that an artisan of ordinary skill would \nhave \nat least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, chemical \nengineering, pharmaceutical sciences, or a related \ndiscipline, along with several years of experience working \nin pharmaceutical development and/or solid state \nchemistry[] [ and] would also have been part of a team \nwhich would have included synthetic organic chemists and \n12 process chemists, formulation scientists, analytical \nscientists, and clinicians. \nD.I. 891-1 142. \nF. Crystalline Forms and XRPD Testing \n27) Solids are either amorphous or crystalline in form. The constituent \natoms or molecules of an amorphous solid are randomly arranged. Tr. at 239:21-\n240: 10 (Myerson). The constituent atoms or molecules of a crystalline solid are \narranged in definite and repeating patterns. Id. at 467 :23-468: 15 (Steed). These \nrepeating patterns, often referred to as \"packing arrangements,\" vary. Id. When a \ncompound has more than one crystalline form (because its constituent atoms or \nmolecules can have more than one packing arrangement), it is said to exhibit \npolymorphism. Crystalline forms are sometimes referred to as polymorphs. Id. at \n215:4-22 (Munson). \n28) The crystalline forms of a pharmaceutical compound can exhibit \nmarkedly different physical properties and can affect the compound's stability, \nsafety, and efficacy. In general, a pharmaceutical formulator prefers to use a \ncrystalline form that is highly stable in order to reduce the likelihood that the \ncompound will convert to a physical form that might be less safe or efficacious. \nTr. at 130:18-131:11 (Zablocki). \n29) Crystalline forms (i.e., polymorphs) that contain water are called \nhydrates. A monohydrate contains one molecule of water in the crystal lattice for \n13 every molecule of the compound. Tr. at 136:24-137:1 (Zablocki); id. at 310:11-15 \n(Myerson); id. at 456:13-16 (Steed). \n30) Anhydrous forms contain no water. Tr. at 373:6-22 (Hancock). \n31) The parties identified at trial four methods used by scientists to \nanalyze and identify crystalline forms: Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy \n(FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis \n(TGA), and X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). See, e.g., Tr. at 268:20-269:5, \n311 :21-312:14 (Myerson). \n32) Both parties characterized XRPD as the \"gold standard\" for \ncrystalline form identification. See D.I. 891-2 ,r 22; see also D.I. 925 at 7 n.l. \n33) XRPD testing is performed by shining a source of X-rays on a solid \nsample and detecting and measuring the X-rays that are diffracted from the sample. \nTr. at 211:8-13 (Munson). The output of an XRPD test is called a diffractogram. \nId. at 211: 14-18 (Munson). Peaks in a diffractogram are identified at units called \ndegrees 2-theta, and the standard error for these measurements is\u00b1 0.2. Id. at \n212:4-17, 225:1-12 (Munson); id. at 250:16-22, 254:17-19 (Myerson); id. at \n464:23-465:6, 465:10-22 (Steed). \n34) A special type ofXRPD testing, using synchrotron radiation generated \nby a particle accelerator, can be performed at 16 research facilities in the United \nStates. Synchrotron testing is more expensive and more sensitive than \"standard\" \n14 or \"regular\" laboratory XRPD testing. The parties throughout the trial and in their \nbriefing referred to laboratory or standard XRPD testing as simply \"XRPD\" and \nreferred to synchrotron XRPD as \"synchrotron.\" Tr. 299:5-17, 334:17-335:2 \n(Myerson); id. at 483:2-11, 531:21-532:5, 533:9-14, 536:15-18 (Steed). \n3 5) The preparation and handling of a sample can affect the XRPD \nanalysis of that sample. Tr. at 329:7-9 (Myerson). \nG. Regadenoson \n36) Regadenoson is a compound with the chemical name (1-{9-\n[( 4S,2R,3R,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-6-aminopurin-2-\nyl}pyrazol-4-yl)-N-methylcarboxamide. D.I. 891-1 ,r 36. \n3 7) Regadenoson can exist in various crystalline forms, each of which has \ndifferent characteristics, including different XRPD patterns. Tr. at 215 :4-22 \n(Munson). \n3 8) \"Crude\" regadenoson is non-crystalline regadenoson that has an \namorphous form, meaning that its molecules are randomly arranged and have no \nrepeating internal structure. Crude regadenoson is not stable and has a tendency to \nconvert to crystalline material. Tr. at 239:21-240:10, 243:5-9 (Myerson). \n39) Crude regadenoson is amorphous, and its XRPD diffractogram shows \nno sharp peaks: \n15 DTX-111.9. \n1. Regadenoson Polymorphs \n40) It is undisputed that eight crystalline forms of regadenoson have been \nidentified to date: Form A, Form B, Form C, Form D, Form G, and two different \nforms that have each been designated by different artisans as Form E. Tr. at \n139:1-5 (Zablocki); id. at220:5-7, 226:11-17, 227:4-13, 227:20-25 (Munson); id. \nat 239:3-6 (Myerson); id. at 458:6-8, 464:7-8, 464:23-465:3, 465:12-22, 466:14-\n17 (Steed); PTX-273.5; see D.I.914136; D.I. 914 at 11 n.3. \n41) XRPD analysis of Form A regadenoson shows peaks near, among \nother points, 5.6, 9.1, 1 I.I, 13.1, 14.4, and 16.8\u00b0 2-theta. DTX-3.8; see Tr. at \n253:23-254:2 (Myerson). It is undisputed that the most intense peak in Form A's \nXRPD diffractogram occurs at 5.6\u00b0 2-theta, as shown in Figure 3 of the #183 patent \n16 depicted below.

PTX-273.9, 11; Tr. at 459:7-14 (Steed). \n45) There are, however, other known regadenoson polymorphs that have \npeaks that fall within the margin of experimental error of 5.6\u00b0 2-theta. Tr. at \n463: 11-15 (Steed). \n46) For example, Dr. Steed testified that Form B, which is depicted in \nFigure 5 of the #883 patent, has \"a peak that's in the vicinity of 5.6 within the plus \nor minus 0.2 degrees experimental error.\" Tr. at 464:7-10. Figure 5 supports that \ntestimony: \n19 FIG. 4 show1 the X-Ray diffraction pattern for (1=1,9~[(4S, \n2R,3R,5R)-3,4-diliydtoxy-5-(hydf'oxymethyl)oxolan-2-y1]-o\u00ad\naminopurin-2-yl} pyruo!-4-yl)-N-metbylcarboxamide FoonB. \nDTX-3.1, 9, 13 (annotated). \n47) Dr. Munson testified that Form B does not have a peak at 5.6\u00b0 2-theta, \nbut instead at \"a little bit lower than that[,] ... a little closer to 5 degrees 2-theta.\" \nTr. at 226:8-10. He did not, however, specify how close that peak is to 5\u00b0 2-theta \nas compared to 5.6\u00b0 2-theta; and thus, he did not rule out that this peak is at 5.4\u00b0 2-\ntheta, which would put it within the 0.2\u00b0 2-theta margin of experimental error for \nthe Form A peak at 5.6\u00b0 2-theta. Id. at 464:7-10 (Steed). \n48) Dr. Munson testified that the asserted patents \"say[] that the X-ray \nanalysis of the [Form B] crystals was distinctly different from any other \n20 polymorph.\" Tr. at 226:11-17. This is true but irrelevant. The pattern for Form B \nis distinct from other polymorphs. But that does not mean that every peak in Form \nB is different from every peak in every other regadenoson form. \n49) Plaintiffs argue that a polymorph screening test conducted by Curia1 \nin 2002 reported that Form B \"contains a peak near 5.0, not at about 5.6.\" D.I. 914 \n,r 35. But the polymorph screen in question states only that \"[t]he XRPD pattern \nfor form B contains a peak near 5.0\u00b0 2-theta while there is no peak near this \nposition in the XRPD pattern for Form C.\" PTX-55.23. No record evidence was \nadduced to establish what \"near 5.0\" means in the polymorph screen. \n50) I therefore find based on Figure 5 of the #883 patent and Dr. \nSteed's testimony that Form B has a peak within the margin of error of Form \nA's characteristic peak at 5.6\u00b0 2-theta. \n51) Form D regadenoson, disclosed in Figure 4 of U.S. Patent No. \n8,859,522 (the #522 patent), also has a peak within the margin of error of 5.6\u00b0 2-\ntheta. Tr. at 464:23-465:6 (Steed). In fact, as Dr. Steed testified, Forms A and D \n1 Technically, the polymorph screen had been completed by SSCI, which had been \nCuria's third-party testing partner for years, prior to its acquisition by Curia and its \nrebranding as \"Curia Indiana.\" See Tr. at 346:14-17, 351:21-352:1 (Myerson); id. \nat 398:19-25 (Hancock). For ease of reference, I will refer to both SSCI and Curia \nIndiana simply as \"Curia.\" \n21 have several overlapping peaks. Id. at 521:18-522:14. Figure 4, depicted below, \nsupports Dr. Steed's conclusion: \ntJ 1500 --------------------------! \nC :::, \n8 \n--;; 1000 ---------------------------\u00ad ::J \n0 +----......-----,------,-------,.-----~---.------.------1 \n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 \n2-Theta (0) \nFigure 4 \nDTX-130.5. \n52) Plaintiffs argue that Figure 4 \"reflects a mixture of polymorphs that \nincludes Form A.\" D.I.914136. It is true that the #522 patent states that \"[i]n \n[one] embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising Form D of \nregadenoson and one or more other solid state forms ofregadenoson, such as Form \nA, B[,] or C of regadenoson.\" DTX-130.9. But the patent explicitly states that \n\"FIG. 4 is an [XRPD] pattern of Form D of regadenoson,\" that \"[t]he [XRPD] \npattern of the crystalline form (Form D) is provided in FIG. 4,\" and that \"the \ncrystalline form of regadenoson (Form D) is characterized by a[n] [XRPD] pattern \nsubstantially as shown in FIG. 4.\" Id. at 7, 9; see Tr. at 542:7-17 (Steed). \n22 Accordingly, I reject Plaintiffs' argument that the presence of Form A accounts for \nthe 5.6\u00b0 2-theta peak in Figure 4; and I find, based on Dr. Steed's credible \ntestimony and Figure 4, that Form D has a peak at approximately 5.5\u00b0 2-theta, \nputting it within the margin of error of Form A's major peak. DTX-130.5; Tr. at \n464:23-465 :6. \n53) The Form E regadenoson disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 9,441,006 (the \n#006 patent), DTX-114, also has a peak within the margin of experimental error of \n5.6\u00b0 2-theta, namely 5.8\u00b0 2-theta. Dr. Steed, whom I found to be credible, testified \nthat \"[t]his particular polymorph E disclosed in the [#]006 patent is a polymorph \nthat has a peak at 5.8 degrees. And that's[] listed in the claims of the patent, claim \n1, and, of course that's within the 0.2 degrees error of 5.6 as well. ... [T]he first \npeak that is indicated in the diffraction pattern [is] ... 5.8 degrees.\" Tr. at 465:10-\n466:9; see DTX-114.1, 9. \n54) Figure 1 of the #006 patent is depicted below: \n23 Intensity \n(counts) \n30000 \n20000 \n10000 \nFig. 1 \nDTX-114.3. 10 15 File oame:REG_FD1015.xrdml \n20 25 30 35 40 45 2Theta(*) \n55) Plaintiffs assert that \"Form E does not have a peak at about 5.6\u00b0 2-\ntheta when converted to the same x-ray wavelength ... used in the Patents-in-Suit \nto measure Form A,\" as \"[t]he diffractogram and peak list for Form E were \ngenerated using a Cobalt anode wavelength,\" whereas \"the Patents-in-Suit used a \nCopper anode to generate the Form A dif:fractogram, and Curia's patent application \nalso used a Copper anode.\" D.I.914137 (emphasis omitted). Plaintiffs' experts, \nhowever, did not offer any testimony about the #006 patent, nor does the term \n\"copper anode\" appear in any trial testimony-it was first used by Plaintiffs' \ncounsel during closing argument. Tr. at 77 4: 11-19. Even crediting Dr. Myerson' s \n24 testimony regarding the use of \"Bragg's law\" to convert from \"the synchrotron \nwavelength\" to \"the wavelength used in laboratory diffractometers,\" Tr. at 304:2-\n15, and even though Dr. Steed agreed, \"generally\" or \"[b ]roadly\" speaking, with \nDr. Myerson' s explanation of \"polymorphism and different crystalline forms,\" id. \nat 457:6-14, there is no record evidence about whether a Cobalt anode XRPD \ndiffractogram must be converted to be comparable to a Copper anode XRPD \ndiffractogram. And in any event, I found Dr. Steed to be credible generally, and I \ndeemed his testimony about Form E to be credible in particular. Accordingly, I \nfind that the Form E regadenoson disclosed in the #006 patent has a peak within \nthe experimental error of 5 .6\u00b0 2-theta. \n56) There may also be other, as yet undiscovered, crystalline forms of \nregadenoson. Tr. at 347:24-348:10, 359:11-20 (Myerson); id. at 489:17-24, \n500:9-13 (Steed). And as Dr. Myerson admitted at trial, it is possible that an as yet \nundiscovered form of regadenoson will have a peak at 5.6\u00b0 2-theta. Id. at 347:24-\n348:10, 359:11-20. \n2. Conversion of Crude and Anhydrous Crystalline Forms of \nRegadenoson to Form A \n57) Form A is the only known monohydrate crystalline form of \nregadenoson and is the most stable of the known regadenoson crystalline forms. \nTr. at 139:14-19 (Zablocki); id. at 177:18-22 (Seemayer); id. at 229:9-17 \n(Munson); id. at 343 :9-17 (Myerson). \n25 58) Crude, Form F, and Form G regadenoson are anhydrous. Tr. at \n324:2-3 (Myerson); id. at 373:11-22 (Hancock). \n59) It is undisputed that when crude and anhydrous crystalline forms of \nregadenoson are exposed to a sufficient amount of water, including water in the air \n(i.e., humidity) and in reagents, they will convert to Form A. Tr. at 271 :5-13, \n277:4-11, 277:18-281:7, 342:9-25, 358:19-23, 359:21-360:14, 360:22-367:2 \n(Myerson); id. at 467:23-469:5, 470:18-471:4, 504:10-18, 507:8-19 (Steed). \n60) Neither side in this case adduced credible evidence to establish by a \npreponderance of the evidence what amount of water exposure is sufficient to \nconvert crude and anhydrous crystalline forms of regadenoson into Form A. \npart: 61) Dr. Myerson testified at trial during his cross-examination in relevant \nQ. . .. And the concept underlining your theory is that Form \nA is the most stable polymorphic form in the presence of even \nsmall amounts of water, correct? \nA. Well, if we 're going to be precise, what that means is \ncrude or Form F can convert to Form A in a particular -\u00ad\nsomething we call a water activity. And at a given water activity, \nForm A is more stable than amorphous or Form F. \nQ. Your opinion is that the regadenoson mono hydrate is the \nmost stable form at room temperature in the presence of water, \ncorrect? \nA. Right. But I'm being precise because we're talking about \n-we 're not specifying how much water, but the way this works, \nremember -there's something called the water activity. Okay. \n26 And at a given water activity, a Form A will be the most stable \nform in the presence of a given water activity and at room \ntemperature. \nTr. at 343 :2-17 (emphasis added). \n62) On redirect examination, Dr. Myerson testified that \"it's clear that \nForm F converts to Form A at certain water activities.\" Tr. at 359:25-360:1 \n( emphasis added). \n63) Dr. Myerson never explained during his direct, cross-examination, or \nredirect testimony what \"water activity\" is. Nor did he offer an opinion about or \ndescribe the \"given water activity\" or \"particular\" water activity at which Form A \nis more stable than amorphous or Form F regadenoson such that conversion into \nForm A will occur. \n64) After his redirect testimony was completed, I engaged in the \nfollowing exchange with Dr. Myerson: \nTHE COURT: ... What is it about the quantity of water \nthat would enable you to offer an opinion with a \nreasonable degree of scientific certainty that it's more \nlikely than not [that Curia's crude regadenoson \nintermediate undergoes some conversion to Form A]; what \nis it about the quantity of water that leads you to that \nconclusion? \nTHE WITNESS: I believe I did a rough calculation and \nthere's about one water for every ten regadenoson present \nin that process, which is not a tiny amount of water. It's \ncertainly enough water to cause some of the amorphous \nmaterial to convert; not completely convert, but some of it \nto always convert or very likely convert. \n27 THE COURT: Well, what if the water [in a sample of \ncrude regadenoson] was one in every 20 of regadenoson \npresent in [the] form -in the crude form; at that point what \nwould the chances of -the likelihood of conversion to \nForm A be? \nTHE WITNESS: The likelihood of conversion would still \nbe significant, just the amount of conversion would be \nless. Right. The amount of conversion you can get is -\nhow much Form A you can make is connected to how much \nwater there is. \nTHE COURT: That sounds to me like you're saying if \nthere's any amount, even an infinitesimal, you know, \nsmall amount, you're saying there's still the likelihood of \nconversion over 50 percent[,] but the quantity could vary? \nTHE WITNESS: No. No. You get to a place. This is \nwhat I was talking about[,] and this is a little esoteric. \nTHE COURT: This is the water activity. \nTHE WITNESS: This is the water activity thing. Below a \ncertain water activiry you 're not going to get conversion. \nTHE COURT: How is water activity measured? \nTHE WITNESS: Water activiry is related to the amount of \nwater, but it's a thermodynamic qualiry that you can \nmeasure. It's a little complicated. You know, I don't want \nto start talking about thermodynamics. \nTHE COURT: Let me stop you because you've already\u00ad\neven in your answer you just said it's related to the amount \nof water. \nTHE WITNESS: It's not exactly the amount of water. \n28 THE COURT: What is it then -you know, I mean, I['ve] \ngot to make a decision. \nTHE WITNESS: Yes. \nTHE COURT: I have to make a decision whether it's \nessentially more likely than not. And you're telling me, \nfor every batch made using the [Form G] process that \nCuria uses, there's a better than 50 percent chance that the \ncrude regadenoson is going to lead to the generation of \nForm A? \nTHE WITNESS: Yes. \nTHE COURT: That's what your opinion is? \nTHE WITNESS: That's what my opinion is. \nTHE COURT: Right. The burden's on you to persuade \nme, so -well, why is it that? Why is it better than 5 0 \npercent? Because yesterday you just said it was likely, you \ndidn't say it was more than likely. So I'm trying to \nunderstand why. \nTHE WITNESS: No. It's -okay. So it's the amount of \nwater. And if we go to your hypothetical, there is an \namount of water where it would not be likely. \nTHE COURT: All right. So what's that? What's that \namount of water? \nTHE WITNESS: It's a lot less than, you know, one in\u00ad\nTHE COURT: One in ten? \nTHE WITNESS: One in ten. \nTHE COURT: What is it? \n29 THE WITNESS: J don't know for sure[,] but I would say \nif it was one in 5 0, it would be unlikely. One in 100, \ncertainly unlikely. \nTHE COURT: What could you point to that would give me \ncomfort that you 're not just pulling that out of the air right \nnow, that one in ten is -gets you there, but one in 5 0 \ndoesn't? \nTHE WITNESS: What could I give you? The only way \nyou could have comfort there is looking at conversion \nstudies and the fact -well, the only conversion studies we \nactually have seen relate to exposure to humid air, which \nis not exactly the same thing. But we do know that the \namorphous material converts to Form A when it's exposed \nto humid air. And the amount of water in humid air, we \ncan calculate what that number is and it's probably in that \n-you know, that one -the one to 20, you know, klnd of \nrange. You know, something like that. So that would -\nthat would be where we could quantify something. And \nyou get to a humidity where it won't convert which is \nwhere it would be like one to 5 0. There 's actually some \ntests -there's actually a scientific test where you can \nactually measure this which I haven't seen enough data in \nthis case for, but that's how you would quantify it. \nTHE COURT: Now, you also testified yesterday that it \nwas likely that the Form F would convert to Form A during \nthe process. What's the percentage there? \nTHE WITNESS: In the Form F -yes. So the Form F -\nagain it's, you know, I would say more likely than not \nbeing in the current amount of water they use[,] about 50 \npercent. If they reduce the amount of water, of course it \ncan -it would become less and less likely. \nTHE COURT: What's the amount of water in the process \nthen with respect to Form F? \n30 THE WITNESS: I think it's also-it might be on the order \nof one in 20. In that -in this case I think I estimated it. \nIt's just a quick estimate. I think that's right. The other \nissue with that part of the process is they seem to have \ntrouble controlling their nitrogen blanket, and air has \ngotten into that process which includes humidity, which \nhas led to conversion as well. I mean, that's kind of a \ncontrol problem in their process. But when that happens, \nit certainly can convert. Also, another issue is when they \nlet it sit a long time in the reactor between steps, it's not \nlike these things are done boom, boom, boom. Sometimes \nthe material sits for a long time before the next step, ten \nhours, 20 hours, 30 hours, you know, sometimes even a \ncouple of days. And that can also cause a conversion or \nmake the conversion more likely. \nTr. at 362:17-367:4 (emphasis added). \n65) Thus, according to Dr. Myerson, there is a level of water activity \nabove which Form A will form, and there is a level of water activity below which \nForm A will not form. Dr. Myerson did not, however, identify what those levels \nare or explain how to identify those levels either in general or in the context of the \nmanufacture, collection, or testing of regadenoson. \n66) And according to Dr. Myerson, \"there is an amount of water where it \nwould not be likely\" that crude or Form F regadenoson would convert into Form \nA. But when pressed to identify that amount, Dr. Myerson could only say that (1) \n\"[i]t's a lot less than\" the ratio of one water molecule for every ten regadenoson \nmolecules, and (2) \"the only way you could have comfort\" in identifying that \namount would be to look at \"conversion studies\" that examined amorphous \n31 regadenoson's conversion upon \"exposure to humid air.\" And even though Dr. \nMyerson testified that \"there's actually a scientific test where you can actually \nmeasure ... a humidity where [the crude regadenoson] won't convert\" into Form \nA, neither Dr. Myerson nor any other witness at trial offered or discussed at trial \nthe results of such a test. \n67) I find therefore that Plaintiffs did not prove by a preponderance of the \nevidence what level of water activity or amount of water exposure is necessary to \nconvert crude or anhydrous crystalline forms ofregadenoson into Form A. \nPlaintiff proved only that some unspecified amount of water exposure-either by \ndirect contact with water or by exposure to humidity in air-will cause crude and \nanhydrous crystalline regadenoson to convert to Form A regadenoson. \nH. Astellas's NDA \n68) In April 2008, the FDA approved Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s NDA for \nLexiscan\u00ae, a 0.4 mg/5 mL (0.08 mg/mL) intravenous solution ofregadenoson. \nAstellas launched Lexiscan\u00ae two months later.

Tr. at 342:3-5, 357:4-12 \n(Myerson). Hospira and Curia knew that Plaintiffs owned patents that covered \nForm A, and Hospira and Curia wanted to avoid infringement of those patents. \nPTX-838.8 (Hospira presentation noting \"Regadenoson Monohydrate is covered \nby patent\"); PTX-892.1; Tr. at 189:24-190:2 (Fearnow); id. at 294:14-17 \n(Myerson). \n34 80) Plaintiffs allege that Curia disclosed in its original DMF \"that Curia \nconsidered Form A as an impurity/intermediate in its process,\" D.I. 914 ,r 98, but I \nfind that the documents and deposition testimony Plaintiffs cite in support of that \nassertion are ambiguous and do not establish by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat Curia disclosed in its DMF that it considered Form A to be an impurity or \nintermediate of its Form G manufacturing process. See PTX-51.392 (listing Form \nA in a table \"of available reference standards for impurities and intermediates\" \nand thus suggesting that Curia considered Form A to be a reference standard as \nopposed to an impurity or intermediate (emphasis added)); PTX-839.4 (listing \nForm A under heading \"Impurity Descriptions\" but not listing Form A under \nheading \"Characterization of Potential Impurities\"); id. at 4-11 (not listing Form A \nin tables of potential impurities); Tr. at 189:5-13, 191 :11-15 (Fearnow). \n81) Hospira and Curia nonetheless had reason to be concerned at the time \nHospira filed its ANDA that Form A could result from the exposure of crude and \nForms F and G regadenoson to water in Curia's manufacturing process. Curia had \nconducted and brought to Hospira' s attention XRPD test results that suggested the \npresence of Form A in samples of crude and Forms F and G regadenoson taken \nfrom Curia's manufacturing process in 2016. As discussed more fully below, see \ninfra Section II.L.2, whether the presence of Form A suggested by this testing \nresulted from the handling of the samples in connection with their testing or from \n35 the manufacturing process itself is not clear today and was not clear at the time; but \nHospira and Curia clearly had concerns about the test results at the time, and they \nhad those concerns because they knew that Plaintiffs owned patents that covered \nForm A. PTX-838.8; PTX-892.1; Tr. at 189:24-190:2 (Fearnow); id. at 294:14-17 \n(Myerson). \n1. 2021 Changes to Curia's DMF and Batch Records \n82) As a result of those concerns, Curia amended its DMF in 2021 to \n\"optimize[]\" its manufacturing process to limit the presence of water in the process \nand to \"tighten[]\" its specifications for the identification of Form G by XRPD. \nPTX 11010.1; Tr. at 382:14-389:9 (Hancock).2 \n2 The DMF was not changed from its original filed form in any way material to the \nparties' infringement dispute until Curia amended it in 2021. Plaintiffs assert that \nCuria made material changes in April 2018, when it dropped from its \nmanufacturing process two in-process checks (IPCs) that used XRPD to test \nCuria's crude and Form F intermediates for the presence of Form A. D.I. 914 \n,r,r 61-62; see Tr. at 394:10-396:16, 402:8-408:20 (Hancock); FGTX-205.21; \nPTX-1 l0lA. Plaintiffs say that Curia's dropping the IPC checks was \n\"disingenuous[]\" and \"a tacit acknowledgement of [Curia's] infringement \nproblem.\" D.I. 913 at 18-19. I disagree. \nFirst, as Hancock credibly testified, Curia removed the IPCs after realizing (1) that \nexposure to airborne water during the removal, storage, shipping, and testing of \nsamples of crude and Form F intermediates could be causing Form A conversion \nand rendering the tests unreliable, and (2) that it was not feasible to wait days or \nweeks for the results of XRPD testing-to confirm the absence of Form A-before \ncontinuing the process with those intermediates. Tr. at 395:3-397:22; see id. at \n504:22-506:15 (Steed). As I discuss further below, Plaintiffs have not proven by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the Form A detected in samples from Curia's \npre-2021 batches of crude, Form F, and Form G regadenoson were the product of \n36 83) Specifically, Curia amended the \"specifications\" (section 3.2.S.4.1) \nand \"stability\" (section 3.2.S.7.2) sections of its DMF to explicitly require the \nidentification of the final Form G product by an XRPD analysis in which the \n\"[s]ample pattern conforms to the Regadenoson anhydrous Form G reference \npattern, designated prominent peaks are present, and no peaks are observed for \nother solidforms.\" FGTX 328.2 (emphasis added); see FGTX 332.2; HTX 218.2. \nCuria's original XRPD specification had merely required an XRPD analysis that \n\"include[d] the sixteen diffraction angles characteristic ofRegadenoson anhydrous \nForm G,\" with \"no additional peaks observed.\" FGTX-110.174, 221-222. \n84) Curia also amended its corresponding analytical procedures relating to \nthe XRPD testing. FGTX-329.45. Its validated test method now requires that the \nXRPD diffraction patterns show \"all of the prominent peaks present in the sample \npattern are present in the [Form G] reference pattern, all of the prominent peaks \npresent in the [Form G] reference pattern are present in the sample pattern, and no \nintrinsic aspects of Curia's process as opposed to contamination or mishandling of \nthe samples in connection with the testing. Thus, Hancock's explanation rings \ntrue. \nSecond, whether Curia tests its intermediates is not probative of the likelihood of \nconversion of those intermediates into Form A during Curia's manufacturing \nprocess. No doubt, the results of such tests could be probative of conversion; but \nCuria's decision to employ or not employ such tests is probative, at most, of \nCuria's ( and Hospira' s) knowledge and intent. \n37 peaks are observed in the selected noise regions of the Form G pattern.\" Id. \n( emphasis added). These noise regions include the area at 5 .6\u00b0 2-theta. Id. \n85) As a result of these amendments, Curia's extant DMF specifications \n\"rule[] out the observation of any other solid forms,\" including Form A \nregadenoson, in Curia's final product, measured both at the time of release, FGTX-\n328.2; HTX-218.2, and for the shelf life of the product, FGTX-332.2. And thus, \n\"even if there's only one peak for any other solid form\" found in a sample, that \nsample would fail the DMF's specifications. Tr. at 478:7-19 (Steed). Moreover, \nthe analytical method used for the amended DMF and ANDA specifications \nrequires that no peaks are observed in the ranges of 3-7\u00b0 and 9.5-14\u00b0 2-theta. \nPTX-1 l0lN.47-48. And although \"identification methods typically do not assess \nlow intensity peaks,\" Curia's current method expressly \"require[s] evaluation of \nsample patterns for any peaks above the noise level in the two regions of interest.\" \nPTX-l l0lN.45. Therefore, any peak at or near 5.6\u00b0 2-theta of any intensity above \nnoise would trigger a failed specification, and \"the batch would be rejected and \nultimately disposed of.\" Tr. at 388:16-22 (Hancock). Such a specification failure \nwould also mean that Hospira \"wouldn't be able to use that batch.\" Id. at 479:18-\n480:2 (Steed). \n86) Hospira amended its ANDA in 2021 to incorporate the changes Curia \nmade to its DMF. Specifically, on August 24, 2021, Hospira filed a \"Gratuitous \n38 Amendment\" (i.e., unsolicited amendment) with the FDA that \"provides for a \nchange in the XRPD specification for the Regadenoson drug substance.\" PTX-\n8011.1; HTX-218.2; Tr. at 285:4-13 (Myerson). Hospira's XRPD specification for \nregadenoson is the same as Curia's XRPD specification for regadenoson. Tr. at \n282:14-25, 285:4-11 (Myerson); id. at 382:22-383:7 (Hancock); PTX-ll0lM.2; \nHTX-218.2. \n87) Curia also amended its batch records in 2021 to require Form F to be \nstored in an MSC weighing isolator before the Form G stage of the process. The \nMSC isolator is purged with nitrogen and, as a result, \"free of water.\" FGTX-\n48.45, 58; FGTX-44.49-50; Tr. at 391 :5-6 (Hancock); id. at 473 :9-10 (Steed). \n88) This addition of the MSC isolator provides an added layer of certainty \nthat the Form F regadenoson will be protected from water and airborne humidity, \nthereby decreasing the likelihood that it ( or the Form G generated further \ndownstream in the process) will convert to Form A. Tr. at 391:2-8 (Hancock). \n89) Plaintiffs did not adduce at trial evidence that the addition of the MSC \nisolator would not reduce the amount of airborne water exposure in the Form F and \nsubsequent stages of Curia's manufacturing process. Plaintiffs argue that \"Curia's \nintroduction of the MSC isolator into its process fares no better [than Curia's \noriginal manufacturing process] as it does nothing to prevent the introduction of \nwater through the reagents during the synthesis of the Curia APL\" D.I. 931 at 6 \n39 ( emphasis added). But reagents are not the only potential source of water in the \nmanufacturing process. Indeed, Dr. Myerson insisted at trial that \"air has gotten \ninto [Curia's original] process[,] which includes humidity, which has led to \nconversion as well.\" Tr. at 365:13-366:23 (emphasis added). For that reason, I \nfind that test results of samples taken from the Form F and Form G stages of \nCuria's manufacturing process before the process was amended to include an MSC \nisolator are not probative of whether Form A would be converted from Form For \nForm Gin Curia's current manufacturing process. \n90) The 2021 batch records also require more than 20 additional in\u00ad\nprocess checks throughout the crude, Form F, and Form G stages to ensure that the \nwater specification for the 200-proof ethanol reagent is below the specified level \n(1000 ppm) at all stages of the process and each time it is used. See, e.g., FGTX-\n43-48; see Tr. at 390:18-391:1 (Hancock). Thus, ethanol is now sampled when it \nis brought into the manufacturing facility and is \"tested for water content to verify \nthat that ethanol is still meeting that specified water limit\" at that time. Tr. at \n390:19-391 :1 (Hancock). This check differs from the pre-2021 process where the \n200-proof ethanol was \"tested ... as [Curia] received it in the warehouse,\" \nsometimes \"months potentially before use.\" Id. at 433:3-14 (Hancock). Curia did \nnot, however, change the specification for the ethanol used in its process, and thus \n40 the ethanol used both before and after the DMF and batch record amendments \ncould contain up to 1000 ppm (0.1 %) water. PTX-1 l0lL. \n91) Curia also tightened the water specification for its solvent \nmethylamine (33% in ethanol), narrowing the upper limit from 1.0% water to \n0.2%, but Curia represented that it had \"historically met this [lower] limit.\" \nFGTX-324. \n92) Accordingly, I find that the addition of the MSC isolator provided an \n\"additional layer of certainty that [the Form F regadenoson] will be protected from \nwater [and] from moisture.\" Tr. at 391:2-8 (Hancock). But I find that the changes \nto Curia's batch records and DMF did not necessarily provide an additional level \nof certainty that the crude regadenoson used in the manufacturing process would \nbe better protected from water and moisture. \n2. Whether Curia Will Follow Its 2021 DMF and Batch \nRecord Amendments \n93) Because Hospira's ANDA incorporates Curia's DMF, and Curia has \nno Form G \"remaining that was manufactured according to the original pre-2021 \nprocess ... available for sale to Hospira,\" Tr. at 400:9-12 (Hancock), going \nforward, the ANDA product that Hospira will market will be manufactured using \nForm G prepared by Curia according to Curia's amended process and in a manner \nconsistent with Curia's extant XRPD specifications, batch records, and reagent \n41 specifications, id. at 400:2-12 (Hancock); see also id. at 437:21-439:13 (Hancock) \n(Curia must follow its batch records). \n94) Neither Plaintiffs nor Hospira sought to introduce at trial expert \ntestimony about FDA procedures or regulations. \n95) Hospira adduced credible record evidence to support its assertion that \nCuria is required by law to manufacture its Form G regadenoson in compliance \nwith its extant DMF and batch records. See Tr. at 377:20-378:23, 389:10-390:15, \n437:8-439:13 (Hancock). \n96) Plaintiffs offered no credible evidence or legal authority to rebut that \nassertion. Plaintiffs never stated at trial or in their briefing that Curia and Hospira \nare not bound by Curia's extant DMF and batch records; nor did they ever deny \nHospira's assertion that Hospira and Curia are bound by the 2021 batch records. \n97) Instead, Plaintiffs intimate that Curia may be able to get away with \nnot complying with its revised batch records. Plaintiffs state, for example, that the \n2021 batch records \"w[ ere] not part of the 2021 DMF amendment, nor [ were they] \never provided to [the] FDA because '[they] really didn't affect the key quality \nattributes that the FDA would typically review.\"' D.I.914179 (citing PTX-\n1101O.1; Tr. at 389:15-24, 431:3-6 (Hancock); id. at 476:20-477:1 (Steed)). \nSimilarly, Dr. Myerson asserted at trial that \"[t]here's [been] no optimization of \nCuria's process; they just changed specifications. An optimization o[r] change in \n42 the process would require ... a change letter to the FDA indicating how they \nchanged their process and their batch records. There's no such filing that has been \nproduced in this case.\" Tr. at 344:3-10. Plaintiffs also say that the 2021 changes \nm.ust not have meaningfully affected Curia's process because \"Hospira continues \nto rely on pre-2021 exhibit batches\" that it had submitted to the FDA as \n\"representative ... of its ANDA product,\" without ever \"supply[ing] new data\" or \n\"new exhibit batches in connection with\" the optimized process. D.I. 931 at 2. \n98) But none of these assertions, even if true, m.ean that Curia does not \nhave to com.ply with the changes m.ade in 2021 to its batch records. Moreover, Dr. \nMyerson's assertion that \"[t]here's [been] no optimization of Curia's process; they \njust changed specifications\" is demonstrably wrong. As discussed above, Curia \nchanged its batch records in 2021 to add an MSC weighing isolator to reduce the \nexposure of Curia's intermediate Form F to airborne water. FGTX-48.45, 58; \nFGTX-44.49-50; Tr. at 391:5-6 (Hancock); id. at 473:9-10 (Steed). And as noted \nabove, Dr. Myerson admitted that airborne humidity can convert crude and \nanhydrous crystalline forms of regadenoson to Form A, and he testified that \nbecause Curia's pre-2021 process had \"trouble controlling [its] nitrogen \nblanket, ... air has gotten into that process which includes humidity, which has led \nto conversion [of Form F to Form A] as well.\" Tr. at 366:18-23. Thus, the \nreduction by an MSC isolator of exposure to airborne water is not \"just\" a changed \n43 specification, and it does contribute to the optimization of Curia's manufacturing \nprocess. \n99) Plaintiffs also adduced no evidence at trial to show, and did not argue \nin their briefing, that Curia will not comply with its revised batch records. \n100) Accordingly, I find that the Form G made by Curia that will be used \nin Hospira's ANDA product will meet the specifications of Curia's extant DMF \nand the requirements of its batch records revised as of 2021. \nJ. The Level of Water Activity and Amount of Water in Curia's \nDMF Manufacturing Process \n101) As noted above, when I questioned Dr. Myerson after his redirect \ntestimony, he testified that he \"believe[d] [he] did a rough calculation and there's \nabout one water for every ten regadenoson present in [Curia's manufacturing] \nprocess.\" Tr. at 362: 17-25. \n102) When I asked him, \"What's the amount of water in the process then \nwith respect to Form F?\", he replied, \"I think it's also -it might be on the order of \none in 20. In that-in this case I think I estimated it. It's just a quick estimate. I \nthink that's right.\" Tr. at 366: 12-17. \n103) Plaintiffs never offered at trial documents or testimony to support, \nconfirm, or clarify Dr. Myerson's \"rough calculation\" and \"quick estimate\" of the \nrelative amounts of water and regadenoson in Curia's manufacturing process. \n44 104) Other than this \"rough calculation\" and \"quick estimate,\" Dr. \nMyerson never provided at trial any quantitative estimate of the level of water \nactivity or amount of water present in Curia's manufacturing process. \n105) Dr. Myerson testified only that there are \"finite amounts of water \npresent\" in the process. Tr. at 342:12-13; see also id. at 267:1-3 (\"Well, there's \nquite a bit of methylamine [in the process]. And even with a small percentage of \nwater, that's going to be a finite amount of water.\"); id. at 268:3-5 (\"[T]here's a lot \nof ethanol in the process[,]\" and \"a lot of ethanol means a finite amount of \nwater.\"). \n106) I find that Dr. Myerson's \"rough calculation\" and \"quick estimate\" of \nthe relative amounts of water and regadenoson in Curia's process are exactly what \nhe said-\"rough\" and \"quick\"-and therefore of little probative value. \nAccordingly, I find that Plaintiffs failed to prove by a preponderance of the \nevidence the level of water activity in Curia's manufacturing process; and I find \nthat Plaintiffs failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of \nwater present in Curia's manufacturing process. \n107) I find more credible than Dr. Myerson's testimony was the testimony \nof Dr. Steed that \"the trace\" and \"residual amounts of water\" in Curia's process are \n\"far, far less than [the required] concentration\" to convert the crude and anhydrous \n45 crystalline forms of regadenoson into Form A and \"can't be enough to induce the \ncrystallization of Form A.\" Tr. at 510:3-7, 11-13. \nK. Whether Form A Has Been Found in or Is Likely to Be Found in \nHospira's ANDA Product or During the Manufacture of That \nProduct \n108) Curia manufactured a Form G regadenoson batch in May 2021 using \nits optimized processes. Tr. at 392:12-14 (Hancock); see FGTX-43; FGTX-44. \n109) Curia obtained samples of the crude, Form F, and Form G \nregadenoson from the May 2021 batch. Tr. at 398:4-11 (Hancock). Curia \nfollowed \"supplemental instructions with very specific procedures\" when it \ncollected and handled the samples. Id. at 398:8-11 (Hancock). These instructions \nrequired that the sample containers used to ship the sample to the XRPD testing \nsite be \"filled in the glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere, sealed, and then ... \nnot ... opened again until [they were] received at the testing laboratory and they \nwere ready to conduct the analysis.\" Id. at 398:12-18 (Hancock). The handling of \nthese samples was \"very different than [Curia's] ... informal handling with no \nprocedures in place in earlier batches\" made before the 2021 optimizations. Id. at \n398:17-18 (Hancock). \n110) Curia provided Plaintiffs with samples of the crude, Form F, and \nForm G regadenoson from the May 2021 batch. FGTX-30; Tr. at 347:2-4 \n(Myerson). \n46 111) Plaintiffs offered at trial no testing evidence for the crude and Form G \nregadenoson obtained from the May 2021 batch samples it was provided. Tr. at \n324:25-325:18, 347:5-8 (Myerson). \n112) Hospira, by contrast, offered at trial evidence ofXRPD testing \nconducted by Curia of the crude, Form F, and Form G samples from the May 2021 \nbatch. That testing showed that Form A was not present in the crude, Form F, and \nForm G regadenoson. FGTX-42; FGTX-44; Tr. at 333:13-17, 346:18-21 \n(Myerson); id. at 481 :3-9, 498:4-17, 499: 11-15 (Steed). \n113) Plaintiffs offered no evidence to suggest that Curia's testing of the \nMay 2021 samples was deficient in any respect, other than to suggest that Form A, \neven if undetected, might still be present below the limit of detection of the XRPD \ntesting. Tr. at 332:6-334:7 (Myerson). \n114) Plaintiffs did not adduce at trial evidence of synchrotron testing of the \n2021 batch samples, even though \"synchrotron tests yield the lowest potential limit \nof detection for Form A regadenoson\" and therefore \"would have provided the best \nevidence for [them] to prove that Form A exists in Curia's API, but [that] it's not \nobserved in standard XRPD testing.\" Tr. at 334:3-7, 334:17-335:2 (Myerson). \nNor did Plaintiffs employ any other alternatives that would have enabled them to \nprove the presence of Form A in Curia's Form Gin trace amounts (e.g., \"a longer \nscan XRPD test to lower the limit of detection\"). Id. at 334:8-16 (Myerson). \n47 115) Curia's XRPD testing of the Form G regadenoson obtained from the \n2021 batch shows no Form A peaks. FGTX-42.7. The pattern from that testing \nshows that the \"largest peak of Form A at 5.6 is completely absent ... [a]nd there \nare no other peaks of Form A .... [F]or example, the 11.1 peak is absent as well.\" \nTr. at 481 :3-9 (Steed). Dr. Myerson agreed that he had \"not seen anything \non ... th[e] most recent Form G batch which showed any Form A peaks.\" Id. at \n333:13-17. \n116) Because the \"peak at 5 .6 is the most prominent peak,\" if it is absent \nfrom a pattern, \"that tells you that Form A can't be there.\" Tr. at 460:8-10 (Steed). \n117) Curia's XRPD testing of the crude regadenoson obtained from the \n2021 batch also showed no Form A peaks. FGTX-42.9; Tr. at 498:4-10 (Steed). \n118) Curia's XRPD testing of the Form F regadenoson obtained from the \n2021 batch was conducted six days after the sample was removed from the \nmanufacturing process. FGTX-42.8; FGTX-44.30-33; Tr. at 499:19-20 (Steed). \nThis testing showed no Form A peaks. FGTX-42.8; Tr. at 499:11-15 (Steed). \nNotably, there is no peak located at or near 5.6\u00b0 2-theta. FGTX-42.8; Tr. at \n499: 11-15 (Steed). Again, the absence of a peak at 5 .6\u00b0 2-theta is sufficient to \nprove the absence of Form A. Tr. at 460:8-10 (Steed). \n48 119) Plaintiffs also offered at trial testing evidence for Form F obtained \nfrom the May 2021 batch. That evidence was based on XRPD analysis performed \nby Dr. Munson. Tr. at 347:2-19 (Myerson); see id. at 428:21-429:17 (Hancock). \n120) Dr. Munson testified that his XRPD analysis showed that the Form F \ncontained Form A based on a peak at 5.74\u00b0 2-theta, which is within\u00b1 0.2\u00b0 2-theta \nof Form A's 5.6\u00b0 2-theta peak. Tr. at 217:7-12, 224:16-25; PTX-ll 75A.1; PTX-\n126.2-13 (Curia patent showing no peak at about 5.6\u00b0 2-theta for Form F). \n121) Dr. Munson's testing results, however, have less probative value than \nCuria's testing results because the samples tested by Dr. Munson were exposed to \natmospheric water outside of the manufacturing process that could account for the \npresence of Form A in the samples. \n122) Curia removed the samples of the Form F intermediate from the 2021 \nbatch on June 18, 2021. FGTX-44.30-33. Curia sent the samples to Dr. Smith at \nPlaintiffs' request. FGTX-30.2. \n123) Dr. Smith testified that he \"[f]ound\" the Form F samples in his \nmailroom on June 29, 2021. FGTX-30.1. Dr. Smith testified that no one \n\"provide[d] [him] any storage instructions,\" and he had no \"knowledge at that time \nabout the properties of Form F.\" Tr. at 445:1-16. \n124) On August 24, 2021-nearly two months after receiving the Form F \nsamples-Dr. Smith opened the samples \"in a glove bag under an argon \n49 atmosphere\" having a relative humidity of23%. FGTX-30.5; Tr. at 445:21-447:4 \n(Smith). At this time, \"[t]wo 200mg samples were weighed out under argon [and] \nthen transferred to previously labeled glass screw cap vials,\" which \"were \ncapped ... [and] removed\" from the glovebox. FGTX-30.5. Once the vials were \nsealed, \"the head space [in the vial] would match the argon atmosphere that was in \nthe glove bag,\" which had \"23 percent relative humidity.\" Tr. at 447:16-20 \n(Smith). Dr. Smith confirmed that \"[m]ost of the vial space\" was \"head space,\" \nmeaning that most of the vial was filled with argon having 23% relative humidity. \nId. at 447:12-20. \n125) Seventeen days later, on September 10, 2021, Dr. Smith placed one of \nthe 200mg samples of Form F back \"in a glove bag under an argon atmosphere,\" \nagain with 23% relative humidity. FGTX-30.6; Tr. at 448:8-17 (Smith). The \nsample was divided into two l 00mg samples, and the \"vials were capped\" and \n\"removed from the glove bag.\" FGTX-30.6. \"[M]ost of the vial volume\" was \n\"head space,\" which \"would be the same as the argon atmosphere.\" Tr. at 449:5-\n14 (Smith). \n126) When Dr. Munson finally conducted his XRPD testing-\"90 days \nafter [the sample] was taken out of Curia's process\"-he again \"exposed Curia's \nForm F sample to moisture for more than an hour.\" Tr. at 229:5-24 (Munson). \n50 127) It is unclear from the record evidence whether using argon as opposed \nto nitrogen makes a difference, as both gasses can provide an inert atmosphere. Tr. \nat 446:9-12 (Smith). \n128) No record evidence was adduced, however, to contradict or even call \ninto question the testimony of Hancock and Dr. Steed that the use of nitrogen in \nCuria's process renders the Form F \"free of any air or humidity and water.\" Tr. \n380:20-22 (Hancock). At best, Plaintiffs assert that \"[t]here is nothing in the trial \nrecord to support Hospira's assertion that the nitrogen atmosphere is 'free of \nwater,' as the certificates of analysis for the nitrogen for the regadenoson process \ndo not measure water content.\" D.I. 931 at 11 n.5 ( citation omitted). Plaintiffs, \nhowever, offered no evidence to show whether there is water in that atmosphere or \nwhat that water content would be. \n129) Dr. Steed testified credibly that Curia's handling and testing of the \n2021 Form F sample employed \"precautions taken to make certain that no moisture \ngot into that sample,\" Tr. 502:5-6, whereas the \"non-rigorous handling at the \ntesting stage\" by Drs. Smith and Munson allowed for the \"ingress of moisture\" and \nexposed the two small samples of Form F to a relatively large amount of \natmospheric air with 23% humidity, such that the testing samples Dr. Munson \nrelied on \"are not representative\" of the Form Fused in Curia's current \nmanufacturing process, id. at 503:9-504:6, 504:10-18. \n51 130) Dr. Munson's testing also did not show any Form A peak other than a \npeak within the margin of error of Form A's 5.6\u00b0 2-theta peak. Form A, for \nexample, has a peak at 11.1 \u00b0 2-theta, Tr. at 253 :23-254 :2 (Myerson), but no such \npeak appeared in Dr. Munson's test results for the Form F samples he tested, id at \n347: 12-23 (Myerson). \n131) For these reasons, I find that Dr. Munson's testing results do not \nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Form F intermediate in \nCuria's manufacturing process contains Form A or is likely to contain Form A. \n132) Based on that finding, as well as (1) Plaintiffs' failure to adduce \nevidence of any testing that showed the presence of Form A in the May 2021 crude \nand Form G regadenoson samples provided to Plaintiffs, and (2) Curia's XRPD \ntest results for the crude, Form F, and Form G samples taken from the May 2021 \nbatch, I find that Plaintiffs have not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that \nCuria's Form G product or its manufacture contains or will likely contain or \nproduce Form A regadenoson. It follows that Plaintiffs have also failed to prove \nby a preponderance of the evidence that Hospira's ANDA product will likely \ncontain Form A. \n52 L. Testing of the API Product and Intermediates Obtained from \nCuria's Manufacturing Process Before the 2021 DMF and Batch \nRecord Amendments \n133) Plaintiffs allege that the results of certain polymorph tests of samples \ntaken from Curia's manufacturing process before the process was amended in 2021 \n(\"the pre-2021 test results\") show that Curia's amended manufacturing process \nwill result in the formation of Form A. \n134) Prior to 2021, Curia manufactured eleven batches of APL One of the \nbatches (US 15600292) \"failed a purity specification and was reprocessed to \nbecome batch no. US15600856.\" D.I. 926 at 30 n.l. Of the remaining ten batches, \nthree were submitted to the FDA in support ofHospira's ANDA (its \"ANDA \nexhibit batches\"), US18600671, US18600308, and US18600250. HTX-19.1; \nFGTX-366. The remaining seven batches are US15600290, US15600291, \nUS15600293, US15600856, US16600386, US16600476, and US19600219. \nFGTX-366; FGTX-200; FGTX-269; FGTX-93.1, 5; FGTX-159; FGTX-150; \nHTX-150. Following the parties' lead, I will refer to these batches by their last \nthree numbers. \n135) The pre-2021 test results relied on by Plaintiffs were for: (1) a sample \nof crude regadenoson taken from batch 476 in 2016, D.I. 914 ,r,r 53-54; Tr. at \n258:24-259:11, 261 :4-24 (Myerson); PTX-1122; PTX-1124; (2) a sample of Form \nF regadenoson taken from batch 386 in 2016, D.I. 914 ,r,r 55-58; Tr. at 414:8-\n53 415:18 (Hancock); PTX-1113; PTX-1116; (3) a sample of Form F regadenoson \ntaken from batch 308 in 2018, D.I. 914 il 59; Tr. at 416: 17-417:10 (Hancock); \nPTX-1134; (4) a sample of Form F regadenoson taken from batch 290 in 2016, see \nD.I. 914 il 60 (mistakenly referencing \"Form F batch 15600291\"); Tr. at 243:19-\n244:16 (Myerson) (\"They have a batch, 15600291, of pure Form F which is the \npowder diffractogram at the bottom, and then they have Form F contaminated with \na low level of Form A at the powder diffraction pattern [of batch 290] above \nthat.\"); PTX-77.2 (referencing the \"[l]ow level ... of Form A in Form F\" for \n\"US15600290\"); id. at 1 (\"No evidence for the presence of Form A was detected in \nthe validation batches listed in the following table[,] [including] \nUS15600291 .... \"); and (5) two samples of Form G regadenoson taken from \nbatch 856, one in late 2015/early 2016 and one in 2020, D.I. 914 ilil 64-65; Tr. at \n279:2-281:7, 302:2-304:18 (Myerson); PTX-78; PTX-87; PTX-879; PTX-1214. \nIn all cases, the samples were removed from Curia's manufacturing facility in \nMissouri and transported to a testing facility in either Indiana or Italy. Tr. at \n369:12-19, 395:21-396:16, 397:7-22, 398:4-25, 407:12-16, 415:9-416:5 \n(Hancock); id. at 497:10-25 (Steed). \n136) As explained below, I find that the pre-2021 test results do not prove \nby a preponderance of the evidence that Curia's Form G regadenoson or its \nmanufacture will likely contain Form A. For that reason, Plaintiffs have failed to \n54 prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Hospira' s ANDA product or its \nmanufacture will likely contain or produce Form A regadenoson. \n1. A Single XRPD Peak Is Insufficient to Identify Form A \n137) As an initial matter, all the pre-2021 testing results cited by Plaintiffs \nare based solely on the identification of a single XRPD peak at around 5 .6\u00b0 2-theta. \nI find, however, that a single XRPD peak is insufficient to identify Form A by a \npreponderance of the evidence since, as noted above, four known forms of \nregadenoson-Forms A, B, D, and E-have a peak within the margin of error of \n5.6\u00b0 2-theta, and as yet undiscovered forms of regadenoson could also have a peak \nwithin the margin of error of 5.6\u00b0 2-theta. As Dr. Steed testified, a detected peak \nat 5.6\u00b0 2-theta \"could arise from some Form A, [or] it could arise from any other \nform that has a peak in that region[,] ... [or] [i]t could be an unknown \n[polymorph].\" Tr. at 489:20-24, 492:3-6. \n138) Plaintiffs cite statements made by Hospira and Curia employees \nsuggesting that the peak at 5.6\u00b0 2-theta is \"characteristic\" of Form A. D.I. 914 \n,r,r 25-29. It is undisputed, however, that Form A's most prominent peak occurs at \n5.6\u00b0 2-theta and that Form G does not have such a peak. Accordingly, it makes \nsense that the employees who reviewed the test results would conclude that the \ntests showed that Form A could be present in the tested Form G samples. \n55 139) That the employees recognized the significance of the 5.6\u00b0 2-theta \npeak, and that Form A might be present if the peak is detected, does not constitute \nan admission that Form A must be present so long as that one peak is detected. See \nTr. at 460:8-10 (Steed) (a single, diagnostic peak's presence is insufficient to \nidentify Form A, but that peak's absence is sufficient to conclude that Form A is \nabsent). \n140) Moreover, no evidence was introduced that the Hospira and Curia \nemployees making statements about the 5.6\u00b0 2-theta peak were qualified to analyze \nXRPD patterns. Instead, the evidence showed the opposite. See, e.g., Tr. at \n183 :3-5 (Knill) (\"Q. Do you consider yourself an expert in the area of X-ray \ndiffraction? A. No.\"); id. at 194:11-13 (Paneerselvam) (\"Q. Have you ever run an \nX-ray powder diffraction experiment? A. No.\"). \n141) Several of the statements in question were also made in the context of \nspiking studies. See, e.g., PTX-1262 (a spiking study conducted by Curia). The \nparties agree that reliance on a single peak may be appropriate in spiking studies \nbecause those studies involve \"quantifying how much [ of a purposefully added \npolymorph] is there,\" such that the scientist \"already know[s] what the materials \nare.\" Tr. at 460:12-18 (Steed); see, e.g., D.I. 914 ,r 26; D.I. 926 ,r 122. Under such \ncircumstances, a single \"diagnostic\" or \"characteristic\" peak may be sufficient for \nthe identification of polymorphs. But those circumstances do not exist here, since \n56 Form A is not added purposefully to the tested sample, and the whole point of the \ntesting is to determine whether Form A is present in the tested sample. \n2. Likely Contamination of Pre-2021 Testing Samples \n142) I also find that Plaintiffs did not establish by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the Form A detected in the pre-2021 testing cited by Plaintiffs was \nformed during or by Curia's manufacturing process, as opposed to being formed \nbecause of exposure to water when the samples were collected, transported to the \ntesting facilities, and tested. \n143) In other words, even assuming for argument's sake that the single 5.6\u00b0 \n2-theta peaks observed in the pre-2021 testing samples relied on by Plaintiffs \nshowed the presence of Form A in the samples, Plaintiffs failed to prove that \nCuria's manufacturing process-and not water exposure during the collection, \ntransportation, storage, and testing of the samples-created the identified Form A. \n144) Plaintiffs cite Curia's 2013 \"process protocols\" as evidence that \nCuria's pre-2021 testing did not expose the samples to water. D.I. 914 ~~ 45, 50-\n51, 63. Those protocols stated that when crude or Form F regadenoson is \"exposed \nto moisture, it changes its crystal form by hydration and it becomes A form (patent \ninfringing).\" PTX-1106.10. The protocols further stated that \"samples (accurately \nprotected by moisture) must be analyzed by XR[P]D in 2-3 days in order to get \ndata to confirm not patent infringing.\" Id. And the protocols instructed employees \n57 to \"[k]eep [the] sample[s] protected from moisture\" when testing for the presence \nof Form A at both the crude and Form F stages. Id. at 11-12. \n145) The protocols, however, did not provide specific guidance or \ndirections. They did not identify or even suggest what steps to take or equipment \nto use to \"accurately protect[]\" the samples from moisture. \n146) Plaintiffs also produced no evidence to suggest or confirm that any of \nthe pre-2021 tests were in fact conducted within 2-3 days of when the tested \nsamples were removed from Curia's manufacturing process. And the record \nevidence shows that testing occurred many days and even years after the samples \nwere taken, thus greatly expanding the amount of time during which the samples \ncould have been exposed to humidity (and, as a result, converted to Form A). See, \ne.g., PTX-1113.5 (XRPD testing on the 386 batch from \"21-Jul-2016\"); PTX-\n1116.2 (\"The Crude, amorphous Regadenoson [from the 386 batch] was held in the \nFD250 from June 30 to July 13 due to the chemist being on vacation,\" during \nwhich time \"some air, containing atmospheric moisture,\" entered and caused \"the \nformation of some monohydrate when analyzed by XRPD.\"); PTX-77.l-2 (noting \nthat XRPD for batch 290 \"was obtained ~4 weeks after the sample was taken\"); cf \nHTX-150 (September 2020 synchrotron testing on several Form G API batches, \nincluding batch 856, that had been manufactured as early as 2015). \n58 14 7) The evidence adduced at trial suggested that no precautions were \ntaken to protect Curia's pre-2021 crude and Form F samples from moisture during \nthe sampling, handling, shipping, or testing steps. Tr. at 394:25-395:5 (Hancock); \nid. at 504:23-505:18 (Steed). \n148) The \"samples were collected, transferred to other containers, \npackaged, shipped off to an offsite laboratory[,] and results could [take] several \ndays or weeks to get back.\" Tr. at 395:14-18 (Hancock). \n149) On the shipping transit forms that accompanied the samples during \ntransportation to the testing sites, Curia either did not specify any special \nconditions to be used to limit the samples' exposure to water or checked the form's \nbox for \"ambient conditions.\" FGTX-232. \n150) Around the time the testing was conducted, Curia concluded that \nexposure to water after the removal of the samples from the manufacturing process \ncould account for the presence of Form A in the tested samples. Curia's Principal \nScientist, Jim Aldred, for example, wrote in a report on a test of the 4 7 6 batch in \n2016 that \"the XRPD result shows that it is present as Form A.\" PTX-1124.1; Tr. \nat 261:25-264:11 (Myerson); id. at 411:12-412:4 (Hancock). And he identified \ntwo possibilities for conversion of crude regadenoson into Form A in the 476 \nbatch: \"(1) the sample of amorphous Regadenoson absorbed water and converted \nto Form A before it was analyzed by [Curia's facility in Indiana], or (2) water \n59 entered the reaction through one of the reagents, methylamine or ethanol.\" PTX-\n1124.1; Tr. at 411:5-412:4, 412:22-413:13 (Hancock). \n151) Dr. Myerson effectively conceded at trial that the pre-2021 testing \nexposed the tested samples to air (and thus humidity): \nQ. And the XRPD testing that was done by [ Curia in \nIndiana] was not done in an airtight system, right? \nA. I'd have to look at the test spec. I think that's right, \nbut I'd have to look at the test protocol[,] which I don't \nrecall. \nQ. So you wouldn't think that XRPD testing on Curia's \ncrude regadenoson was done in an airtight system, right, \nyou wouldn't think that's what happened? \nA. Unless I saw something -yeah, and I think what -\nyou mean in an inert atmosphere is what you're actually \nasking me, to be precise. But you're asking me if they're \ndoing their XRPD test in an inert atmosphere in an \nenvironmental chamber, and I don't think I've seen \nanything that tells me they did that. \nQ. Right. [Curia's] XRPD testing was not done in an \nenvironmental chamber that controls for humidity, right? \nA. That's correct. I should say, as far as I know, that's \ncorrect. I'd have to see their protocol. \nTr. 356:6-22. As noted above, Curia's protocol did not specify that the XRPD \ntesting or the collection and transportation of the samples to the testing site had to \nbe performed in an inert atmosphere or environmental chamber that controlled the \namount of humidity to which the sample was exposed. \n60 3. The Pre-2021 Form F and Form G Test Results Are \nInapposite \n152) With the exception of the 476 batch test results, all the pre-2021 test \nresults were for samples of Form F and Form G obtained from Curia's \nmanufacturing process. But as noted above, Plaintiffs did not adduce at trial \nevidence that the addition of the MSC isolator would not reduce the amount of \nexposure to airborne water during the Form F and subsequent stages of Curia's \nmanufacturing process. \n153) This failure of proof is especially striking in light of Dr. Myerson's \ntestimony that Curia's \"trouble controlling [its] nitrogen blanket\" had resulted in \n\"air ... g[etting] into [its] process[,] which includes humidity,\" and that this \ncircumstance \"ha[d] led to conversion as well.\" Tr. at 366:18-23; see id. (\"[W]hen \nthat happens, [Form F] certainly can convert.\"); see also PTX-1116.2 (\"The Crude, \namorphous Regadenoson was held in the FD250 from June 30 to July 13 due to the \nchemist being on vacation. The batch was to be held in the FD25 0 at room \ntemperature under nitrogen. A nitrogen valve was inadvertently left in the \nCLOSED position and with a slow leak on the FD250, the nitrogen pressure was \neventually replaced with some air, containing atmospheric moisture, leading to the \nformation of some monohydrate when analyzed by XRPD. The Form F had \nalready been converted to Form G by the time the XRPD result was received from \n[Curia].\"). \n61 154) For that reason, I found above that the samples taken from the Form F \nand Form G stages of Curia's manufacturing process before that process was \namended are not probative of whether Form A would be converted from Form F or \nForm Gin Curia's current manufacturing process. This finding is an additional \nreason why the pre-2021 tests of the Form F and Form G samples do not prove by \na preponderance of the evidence that the Form F used in Curia's current \nmanufacturing process and the Form G made by that process will convert to Form \nA. \n4. Testing on the Form G API from the 856 Batch \n155) Plaintiffs rely solely on tests on two samples from the 856 batch to \nshow that Curia's Form G API will more likely than not contain Form A. Tr. at \n325: 11-18 (Myerson) (\"Q. In your opinion, ... those two tests on ... the 856 \nbatch[] showed one Form A peak at [5.6\u00b0 2-theta], correct? A. Correct. Q. You \ndidn't rely on any other testing to support your opinion[,] ... correct? A. \nCorrect.\"). \n156) Form A peaks were detected in two out of five tests conducted on the \n856 batch. PTX-78.1; PTX-879.2; PTX-1214; PTX-87.8; Tr. at 280:18-281:7, \n302:2-304:18, 325:3-14 (Myerson). \n157) Dr. Knill ran synchrotron tests on two samples from the 856 batch. \nHTX-150.8. Testing on the first sample showed a small peak at about 5.6\u00b0 2-theta. \n62 Tr. at 304:2-18 (Myerson); PTX-879.2. But \"[w]hen Dr. Knill tested the second \nsample from the 856 batch, no Form A peaks were detected,\" Tr. at 329:3-6 \n(Myerson), as seen in the following diffraction patterns: \n4~, \n~ \n3500()(} \n30C>OOO 5.6 \n,'500!10 \nlOOO(l(l \n150000 \n5.6 \nHTX-15 0. 8 (annotated). 11.1 \n11.1 Batch No. US15600856 \nSample 1 of 2 \nBatch No. US15600856 \nsample 2of 2 ... __________ 70 \n158) Dr. Myerson \"rel[ied] solely on [a] signal at 5.6 2[-]Theta\" from \ntesting on that first sample to support his opinion that the Form G sample from the \n856 batch contained Form A. Tr. at 328:20-24 (Myerson). \n63 159) The remaining three tests were accelerated stability tests performed by \nCuria in Indiana. The first test showed a single XRPD peak at about 5.6\u00b0 2-theta. \nTr. at 279:2-280:7, 329:15-17 (Myerson); PTX-1214. When the samples from the \n856 batch were tested one month and then again two months after the first test, \"no \npeak was detected between five and six 2-Theta.\" Tr. at 330:11-14 (Myerson). \n160) Based on these inconsistent test results, both Dr. Knill and Dr. Steed \nconcluded that the testing does not prove that Form A crystals exist in the \nexamined Form G API from the 856 batch. PTX-844.9; Tr. at 187:5-15 (Knill); \nid. at 491 :3-14 (Steed). Dr. Steed reasoned that the \"mismatch or ... contradiction \nbetween two measurements of the same material\" from the 856 batch must indicate \nthat whatever is giving rise to the peak at 5.6\u00b0 2-theta is not \"intrinsic to the 856 \nbatch\" but instead \"must arise from the point where sample one was separated \nfrom sample two.\" Id. at 490:15-20. Therefore, \"something happened, and we \ndon't know what ... is giving rise to that peak,\" that is, some handling or \nexperimental error occurred, even if the precise nature of that error is unknown. \nId. at 490:20-22 (Steed). \n161) Plaintiffs argue that it is \"erroneous[] [to] suggest[] that two different \nsamples from the same batch should both show a peak for Form A,\" and they have \noffered an alternative explanation for the \"contradiction\" in testing on the 856 \nbatch. D.I. 913 at 26. Referencing Dr. Steed's testimony that \"you might get a \n64 situation in which some particles that are near the surface, that have touched water, \nhave transformed from G to A, whereas ... other Gs that, perhaps, are beneath the \nsurface have not been touched by the water so haven't transformed,\" Tr. at 470:25-\n471 :4, Plaintiffs note \"that conversion ofForm G to Form A may not be uniform \nacross [an] entire sample,\" D.I. 913 at 26-27. Thus, according to Plaintiffs, any \ninconsistency in Curia's stability tests or Dr. Knill's synchrotron tests on samples \nfrom the 856 batch reflects \"sampling error,\" i.e., the samples in which a Form A \npeak was detected were taken from regions of the batch where conversion had \noccurred ( or where enough localized water was present for conversion to occur \nthereafter), whereas the samples in which a Form A peak was not detected were \ntaken from regions where there had been neither conversion nor sufficient amounts \nof water to cause conversion over time. D.I. 913 at 27. \n162) I agree with Plaintiffs that the three tests that failed to detect Form A \npeaks could have been false negatives (because they were taken from regions \nwhere conversion had not yet occurred in the 856 batch). But it is also the case \nthat the two tests that detected a Form A peak could have been false positives \n(because they were exposed to atmospheric moisture after being removed from the \nbatch). Plaintiffs, however, bear the burden of proof here. And while Dr. Steed \nand Hancock credibly testified as to the lax handling of samples prior to 2021, \nmaking mishandling more likely the culprit for any Form A conversion, Plaintiffs \n65 adduced no affirmative evidence regarding the likelihood of sampling error. \nInstead, they simply say that two tests showed a Form A peak, conversion may not \nbe uniform, and sampling error may occur, and they then conclude that the three \nsamples without a peak at 5.6\u00b0 2-theta were \"likely due to sampling error.\" D.I. \n913 at 27. That sampling error can occur does not mean that sampling error (as \nopposed to mishandling) caused the Form A conversion, especially since Hospira \nadduced credible evidence-and Dr. Myerson conceded-that regadenoson \nsamples taken prior to 2021 were not subject to any specialized handling \nconditions. \n163) In sum, I find that the test results for the 856 batch samples do not \nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that Curia's Form G API will likely \nconvert to or contain Form A. On the contrary, I find Dr. Steed's testimony to be \nlogical and credible. And based on that testimony and the inconsistent results from \nthe 856 tests, I find that, even were a single peak sufficient to identify Form A, any \nForm A in the two positive 856 samples likely resulted from airborne water \nexposure during their sampling, storage, transport, and/or testing. And, in any \nevent, I find these tests results are less probative than the test results conducted by \nCuria of the 2021 batches that showed no Form A in Curia's crude, Form F, and \nForm G regadenoson. \n66 III. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Direct Infringement \nAnalyzing infringement involves two steps. The first step is to construe \ndisputed patent terms consistently with how they would be understood by an \nartisan of ordinary skill. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed. Cir. \n2005) ( en bane). The second step is to determine whether the accused products or \nmethods infringe the patent by comparing those products or methods to the \nconstrued claims. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed. \nCir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 (1996). The first step in the infringement \nanalysis is a question of law; the second is a question of fact. Glaxo, Inc. v. \nNovopharm, Ltd., 110 F.3d 1562, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1997). A patentee bears the \nburden of proving infringement by a preponderance of the evidence. Envirotech \nCorp. v. Al George, Inc., 730 F.2d 753, 758 (Fed. Cir. 1984). \nAs noted above, \u00a7 2 71 ( e )(2 )(A) of the Patent Act defines the filing of an \n/ \nANDA with a paragraph IV certification as an act of infringement. That definition \n\"create[s] case or controversy jurisdiction to enable a court to promptly resolve any \ndispute concerning infringement and validity\" of patents listed in the Orange Book. \nGlaxo, 110 F.3d at 1569. \"Notwithstanding this defined act of infringement, a \ndistrict court's inquiry in a suit brought under\u00a7 271(e)(2) is the same as it is in any \nother infringement suit, viz., whether the patent in question is 'invalid or will not be \n67 infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug for which the [ANDA] is \nsubmitted.'\" Id. (italics and alteration in original) ( underline added) ( quoting 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(vii)(IV)). Thus, \"the ultimate infringement question is \ndetermined by traditional patent law principles and, if a product that an ANDA \napplicant is asking the FDA to approve for sale falls within the scope of an issued \npatent, a judgment of infringement must necessarily ensue.\" Sunovion Pharms., \nInc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d 1271, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2013). By the \nsame token, if the product that an ANDA applicant is asking the FDA to approve \nfalls outside the scope of an asserted patent, a judgment of noninfringement must \nfollow. In short, \"[w]hat [the ANDA applicant] has asked the FDA to approve as a \nregulatory matter is the subject matter that determines whether infringement will \noccur.\" Id. \nThe infringement analysis in an ANDA case is most straightforward when \nthe ANDA's specification directly addresses the elements of the asserted claims \nthat are at issue. \"Because drug manufacturers are bound by strict statutory \nprovisions to sell only those products that comport with the ANDA's description of \nthe drug, an ANDA specification defining a proposed generic drug in a manner \nthat directly addresses the issue of infringement will control the infringement \ninquiry.\" Abbott Lab ys v. TorPharm, Inc., 300 F.3d 1367, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \n68 As the Federal Circuit explained in Bayer AG v. Elan Pharmaceutical Research \nCorp., 212 F.3d 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2000): \n[i]f any of the statements in [the ANDA's] specification \nare false, [the ANDA filer] is subject to civil penalties and \nthe withdrawal of the approval of its drug. Additionally, \nif [the ANDA filer] introduces a drug into interstate \ncommerce without complying with the approval \nrequirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355, it is subject to various \nadditional penalties, including an injunction, criminal \nsanctions, seizure of the unapproved drug, and debarment \nof its corporation and individual officials from submitting \nor assisting in the submission of an ANDA in the future. \n[The ANDA filer] also would be subject to criminal \nprosecution for making false statements to the FDA under \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, conspiring to defraud the United States \nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and obstructing proceedings before \na federal agency under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1501. If [the ANDA \nfiler] changes its ANDA, it must file the changes with the \nFDA, and if the changes are to the drug's specification, \n[the ANDA filer] must obtain approval for the changes \nbefore they can be made. \nId. at 1249-50 (citations omitted). Because of these statutory and regulatory \nrequirements and the consequences that flow from failing to abide by them, courts \n\"cannot assume that [an ANDA filer] will not act in full compliance with its \nrepresentations to the FDA.\" In re Brimonidine Pat. Litig., 643 F.3d 1366, 1378 \n(Fed. Cir. 2011). \nThis principle that an ANDA filer is bound by the representations and \nspecifications in its ANDA is central to the infringement inquiry. And if an \nANDA specification describes a product that either necessarily infringes an \n69 asserted patent or necessarily does not infringe the patent, the specification dictates \nthe outcome of the infringement analysis. See Ferring B. V. v. Watson Lab ys, Inc\u00ad\nFla., 764 F.3d 1401, 1408 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\"In some cases, the ANDA \nspecification directly resolves the infringement question because it defines a \nproposed generic product in a manner that either meets the limitations of an \nasserted patent claim or is outside the scope of such a claim.\"); Elan, 212 F.3d at \n1249 (finding that an ANDA specification that clearly defined a noninfringing \nproduct \"mandate[ d] a finding of no literal infringement\"). \nWhen the ANDA specification does not answer the question of \ninfringement, \"[t]he relevant inquiry is whetherthe patentee has proven by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the alleged infringer will likely market an \ninfringing product.\" Glaxo, 110 F.3d at 1570. In such cases, \"[w]hat is likely to \nbe sold, or, preferably, what will be sold, will ultimately determine whether \ninfringement exists.\" Id. \nWhile\u00a7 271(e)(2) provides the federal courts withjurisdiction to entertain \ninfringement claims directed to drugs or to methods of using drugs, it does not \nprovide jurisdiction to hear infringement claims directed to methods for making \ndrugs. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) (defining infringement as the submission of an \napplication to the FDA \"for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is \nclaimed in a patent\"). Accordingly, Plaintiffs' claims that Hospira infringes claims \n70 1-3 of the #883 patent are necessarily based on the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201, and the relevant direct infringement inquiry is whether the \nmanufacturing process used to make Hospira' s AND A product will infringe the \nasserted claims. \nB. Induced Infringement \n\"Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an \ninfringer.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b). A finding of inducement requires establishing an \nunderlying act of direct infringement, the defendant's knowledge of or willful \nblindness with respect to the direct infringement, and that the defendant's specific \nintent was to encourage the acts that constituted direct infringement. See DSU \nMed. Corp. v. JMS Co., 471 F.3d 1293, 1303, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (en bane in \nrelevant part). \nIV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA. Claim 1 of the #183 Patent \nPlaintiffs argue that Hospira induces Curia's infringement of claim 1 of the \n#183 patent because \"Form A will be made at the crude and Form F stages\" of \nCuria's manufacturing process. D.I. 913 at 10-11. But as explained above, I have \nalready found as a factual matter that Plaintiffs failed to establish by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the crude or Form F regadenoson in Curia's \nmanufacturing process contains or likely will contain Form A. And since Plaintiffs \nfailed to prove direct infringement by Curia of claim 1 of the # 183 patent, their \n71 induced infringement claim necessarily fails. See Epcon Gas Sys., Inc. v. Bauer \nCompressors, Inc., 279 F.3d 1022, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 2002). (\"[T]here can be no \ninducement of infringement without direct infringement by some party.\"). \nB. Claim 6 of the #301 Patent and Claims 1-3 of the #883 Patent \nPlaintiffs argue that Hospira directly infringes claim 6 of the #301 patent \nbecause \"the only claim element Hospira disputes is whether it 'dissolves a \ncrystalline monohydrate form of [ regadenoson]' during manufacturing of its \nANDA product\" and \"Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Curia's [Form G] API will \ncontain Form A, which is a crystalline monohydrate form of regadenoson.\" D.I. \n913 at 30 (alteration in original). Plaintiffs similarly argue that Hospira directly \ninfringes claims 1-3 of the #883 patent because \"the only claim element Hospira \ndisputes is whether Curia's [Form G] API contains a 'monohydrate' or 'crystalline \nmonohydrate' of regadenoson\" and \"Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Curia's \n[Form G] API will contain Form A regadenoson[.]\" D.I. 913 at 31. \nAs an initial matter, Hospira does in fact dispute another claim element of \nthese asserted claims-namely, the claims' requirement that the monohydrate be \n\"substantially free\" of 2-HA. D.I. 925 at 31-32. Hospira argued at trial that claim \n6 of the #301 patent and claim 3 of the #883 patent are invalid as indefinite \nbecause \"substantially free\" of 2-HA is a \"qualitative\" and \"subjective\" term, the \nprecise contours of which \"would be unknown until a drug filer [has] engaged in a \n72 'back and forth' with [the] FDA,\" such that it would not \"know until [it] get[s] \napproved by the FDA whether [its] product is substantially free.\" D.I. 915 at 7-9. \nPlaintiffs asserted in the pretrial order that \"substantially free\" should be construed \nas incorporating and based upon regulatory guidance that \"provides for 10 ppm \nlevels\" of 2-HA. D.I. 891-2 ,r,r 495, 499. But it adduced no evidence at trial to \nestablish what the ppm level of 2-HA in Curia's Form G is, let alone that it is less \nthan 10 ppm. Plaintiffs argue nonetheless that they met their burden to establish \ninfringement of this limitation based on (1) Dr. Myerson's unrebutted trial \ntestimony that 2-HA levels measured in Curia's manufacturing process are below \nthe limit of detection, and (2) the fact that the FDA has granted Hospira tentative \napproval to market its ANDA product. D.I. 931 at 15 (citing Tr. at 287:14-288:13, \n307: 12-15 (Myerson)). \nI need not, however, and therefore do not decide today whether Plaintiffs \nproved that Hospira's ANDA product is \"substantially free\" of 2-HA because, as \nexplained above, I have found as a factual matter that Plaintiffs failed to meet their \nburden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Form A will be present in \nor produced by Curia's manufacturing process. That finding precludes a finding of \ninfringement of the asserted claims of the #301 and #883 patents. \nAs discussed above, I have already found that Plaintiffs did not prove that \nForm A will be present in Hospira's ANDA product for two independent reasons. \n73 First, Curia's amended DMF, which is incorporated into Hospira's amended \nANDA, requires that the Form G be identified with an XRPD analysis that (1) \nshows a pattern that conforms to the Form G reference pattern and (2) shows that \n\"no peaks are observed for other solid forms.\" See supra ilil 82-86. Thus, both the \nextant DMF and the extant ANDA rule out the observation of any other solid \nforms, including Form A. Plaintiffs complain that this change \"does not rule out \nthe presence of Form A\" because the XRPD test called for in the ANDA \namendment \"is an identification, not [a] limit of detection[,] test\" and thus it may \nfail to \"observe[]\" Form A that is present. D.I. 913 at 6. Plaintiffs also fault \nHospira and Curia for \"not us[ing] synchrotron testing as part of their [Form G] \nAPI specifications.\" D.I. 913 at 6. \nPlaintiffs, however, never pointed to any authority that requires either a \n\"limit of detection test\" or synchrotron testing to identify a crystalline form for \nFDA purposes. Moreover, Plaintiffs themselves called XRPD analysis \"the gold \nstandard\" for crystalline form identification, D.I. 891-2 il 22; the asserted patents \nrely on XRPD testing when characterizing Form A, D.I. 891-2 il 24; Tr. at 463:4-6 \n(Steed); DTX-3.13-14; Plaintiffs cited and relied extensively at trial on XRPD \ntesting to prove their case; and, tellingly, Plaintiffs used XRPD, not synchrotron \ntesting, in the only testing they offered at trial that they had conducted themselves, \nD.I. 891-2 ilil 274,355; Tr. at 334:3-335:2, 347:12-19 (Myerson). Nothing \n74 prevented Plaintiffs from using synchrotron testing to determine whether the Form \nG produced in Curia's May 2021 batch contained Form A. Plaintiffs either \nconducted synchrotron testing and got results they did not like, or they chose to \nforego the very testing they now fault Hospira and Curia for failing to incorporate \ninto their ANDA and DMF specifications. \nPlaintiffs' failure to adduce evidence of synchrotron testing at trial to back \nup their arguments regarding Form A being present in the Form G API in trace \namounts is consistent with a second, independent finding of fact that is dispositive \nof Plaintiffs' infringement claims. Putting aside Hospira's amendment to the Form \nG specification, for the reasons explained above, I found that Plaintiffs failed to \nshow by a preponderance of the evidence that Curia's Form G will likely contain \nForm A regadenoson. A judgment of noninfringement of the asserted claims of the \n#301 and #883 patents necessarily follows from that finding. \nC. Plaintiffs' Principal Argument Is Unavailing \nThe thrust of Plaintiffs' infringement theory is that crude and Forms F and G \nregadenoson have \"a propensity\" to convert to Form A when exposed to water, and \nthat water is introduced into Curia's DMF manufacturing process through at least \ntwo reagents (methylamine and ethanol) and/or humidity. D.I. 913 at 1-5, 10-12, \n14-19. This \"propensity,\" however, as Dr. Myerson explained at trial, and as I \nhave found as a matter of fact based in part on his testimony, exists only if the \n75 crude and Forms F and G regadenoson are exposed to a sufficient level of \"water \nactivity\" and a sufficient amount of water. And, as I have already found as a \nfactual matter, Plaintiffs failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence both \n( 1) what level of water activity and amount of water are necessary to convert crude \nand Forms F and G regadenoson into Form A and (2) the level of water activity \nand amount of water in Curia's manufacturing process. That failure of proof \nnecessitates a finding of noninfringement. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, I find that Hospira does not infringe claim \n1 of the #183 patent, claim 6 of the #301 patent, or claims 1-3 of the #883 patent. \nIn light of that finding, I need not and do not address Hospira's affirmative \ndefenses of invalidity. \nThe Court will issue an Order directing the parties to submit a proposed \norder by which the Court may enter final judgments consistent with this Opinion. \n76 "}
