C.A. No. 21-900-RGA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nBefore me is the issue of claim construction of multiple terms in U.S. Patent Nos. \n8,501,730 (\"the '730 patent\") and U.S. Patent No. 10,905,694 (\"the '694 patent\"). The parties \nsubmitted a Joint Claim Construction Brief (D.I. 53), and I heard oral argument on July 1, 2022. \nThe parties argued five terms. I orally ruled on two terms in their entirety. I rejected \nDefendants' indefiniteness argument in relation to the term \"substantially free from.\" (Tr. at \n47:8-48: 11).1 I also rejected Defendants' construction inserting \"and is LH-11 low substituted \nhydroxypropylcellulose\" into Claim 1 of the '694 patent. (Tr. at 89:21-24) . I now construe the \nthree remaining terms. \nI. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]here is no magic formula or \n1 Citations to the transcript of the argument , which is not yet docketed , are in the format \"Tr._.\" \n1 catechism for conducting claim construction.' Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate \nweight to appropriate sources 'in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\"' \nSoftview LLC v. Apple Inc., WL 47758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (quoting Phillips, 415 \nF.3d at 1324) (alteration in original). When construing patent claims, a court considers the literal \nlanguage of the claim, the patent specification, and the prosecution history. Markman v. \nWestview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 977-80 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 \n(1996). Of these sources, \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction \nanalysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\" \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning .... \n[Which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in \nquestion at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application .\" \nId. at 1312-13 ( citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he ordinary meaning of a \nclaim term is its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\" Id. at 1321 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \"In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as \nunderstood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim \nconstruction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted \nmeaning of commonly understood words.\" Id. at 1314 (internal citations omitted). \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evidence -the patent claims, the \nspecification, and the prosecution history -the court's construction is a determination oflaw. See \nTeva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 331 (2015). The court may also make \nfactual findings based upon consideration of extrinsic evidence, which \"consists of all evidence \nexternal to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, \n2 dictionaries, and learned treatises.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317-19 (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). Extrinsic evidence may assist the court in understanding the underlying \ntechnology, the meaning of terms to one skilled in the art, and how the invention works. Id. \nExtrinsic evidence, however, is less reliable and less useful in claim construction than the patent \nand its prosecution history. Id. \n\"A claim construction is persuasive , not because it follows a certain rule, but because it \ndefines terms in the context of the whole patent.\" Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa 'per Azioni, \n158 F.3d 1243, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1998). It follows that \"a claim interpretation that would exclude \nthe inventor's device is rarely the correct interpretation .\" Osram GmbH v. Int 'l Trade Comm 'n, \n505 F.3d 1351, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nII. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS \nA. The '730 Patent \nClaim 1 of the '730 patent is representative of the two disputed terms in the '730 patent: \nA highly pure 7-chloro-5-hydroxy-1-[2-methyl-4-(2-methylbenzoylamino)benzoyl]-\n2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-1-benzazepine having a purity of more than 99.5%, or a salt \nthereof, which is produced by the process which comprises reducing a benzazepine \ncompound of the formula (1): \n(!) \nwherein X1 is a halogen atom, R1 and R2 are independently a lower alkyl group or a salt \nthereof in the presence of a hydrogenating agent selected from the group consisting of \nlithium aluminum hydride, sodium borohydride, zinc borohydride, and diborane in an \namount of0.25 to 1 mole per 1 mole of the compound(]) . \n('730 patent, claim 1) (disputed claim construction term emphasized). \n3 1. \"in an amount of 0.25 to 1 mole per 1 mole of the compound (l)\" ('730 patent, claims 1-\n4) \na. Plaintiff's construction: No construction necessary, i.e., plain and ordinary \nmeanmg \nb. Defendants' construction: \"using a total amount in a molar ratio of no less than \none quarter ofto no more than equal to the moles of compound (l)\" \nc. Court's construction: No construction necessary \nAt the oral argument, I rejected Defendants' proposed insertion of \"total\" to modify \n\"amount.\" (Transc. at 27:22-28:9) . All that remains to consider is the proper construction of the \nnumerical range. \nIn support of their construction of the numerical range, Defendants argue that the \nprosecution history and Plaintiff's previous statements indicate that the numerical range is not \n\"soft\" or an \"approximation.\" (D.I. 53 at 14-15). Plaintiff argues that the term requires no \nconstruction because its meaning is clear to a POSA. (D.I. 53 at 8-10). Plaintiff also argues that \nDefendants' construction would generate confusion because it removes significant figures from \nthe term and merely paraphrases the term. (D.I. 53 at 19-20). \nThe Court finds that this term does not require construction. Though the term lacks words \nof approximation in specifying the numerical range, it also lacks words indicating exactitude or a \nparticular degree of precision. Because the term as written suggests neither approximation nor a \nparticular degree of precision, I reject any construction intended to connote greater precision than \n\"1 mole per 1 mole\" or \"0.25 [moles] ... per 1 mole.\" Though \"reading a margin of error into \nthe disputed claim term\" is not appropriate, see Takeda Pharm. Co v. Zydus Pharms. USA, Inc., \n743 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2014), \"[i]t is usually incorrect to read numerical precision into a \nclaim from which it is absent[.]\" See Modine Mfg Co. v. United States ITC, 75 F.3d 1545, 1551 \n(Fed. Cir. 1996). Defendant is correct that because the claim term lacks \"broadening words,\" the \n4 numerical range in this claim involves a \"strict numerical boundary .\" See Jeneric/Pentron, Inc. v. \nDillon Co., 205 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000). But whether a particular molar concentration \nexceeds the strict numerical boundary of a \"l mole per 1 mole\" ratio is a factual determination \nthat is left for trial, not claim construction. \nDefendants argue that their construction is supported by Plaintiffs prior formulations of \nthe numerical range using terms such as \"equal molar or less\" and \"equimolar or less\" and \"the \nsame\" number of moles. (D.I. 53 at 12-14, 23). Defendants assert that these formulations more \nclearly reflect that the claim term does not involve a \"soft\" upper limit on the number of moles. \n(D.I. 53 at 14). But Defendants' construction is no more precise than the current term language.2 \nIndeed, Defendants' own construction is just as subject to the same arguments they make in \nrelation to the actual claim term. It can be understood \"softly.\" \"No more than equal\" is no \nmore precise than \"1 per 1.\" Therefore, whether a molar concentration is within the term's \nnumerical range remains a question of fact even under Defendants' construction . \nFor these reasons, I will not adopt Defendants' proposed construction for this term. \nPlaintiffs proposal, while perhaps not the last word on the subject, does no harm and is more \nthan sufficient at the present time. \n2. \"in an amount of 0.25 to 0.5 mole per 1 mole of the compound (1)\" ('730 patent, claim 5) \na. Plaintiff's construction: No construction necessary , i.e., plain and ordinary \nmeaning \nb. Defendants' construction: \"using a total amount in a molar ratio of no less than \none quarter of to no more than half of the moles of compound ( 1 )\" \nc. Court's construction: No construction necessary \n2 \"Equimolar\" or \"equal molar\" or \"the same\" number of moles can be modified by words of \nprecision, such that, for instance, \"exactly equimolar\" and \"approximately equimolar\" are more \nor less precise than \"equimolar.\" If so, Plaintiffs past formulations do nothing to show that a \nmore precise construction is warranted. \n5 . ,. The parties' positions regarding this term parallel their positions regarding the previous \nterm. For the same reasons as above, I do not think any construction is necessary. \nB. The '694 Patent \nThis disputed term is the text of \"Step 1 \"3 listed in Claim 1 of the '694 patent: \n\"producing amorphous composites consisting of (a) 7-chloro-5-hydroxy-1-[2-methyl-4-\n(2-methylbenzoylamino)benzoyl]-2 ,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-benzoazepine and/or salt \nthereof, and (b) hydroxypropylcellulose containing a hydroxypropoxyl group in an \namount of 50% or greater\" \n('694 patent at 25:21-27) . The term involves two chemical entities that the parties refer to as (a) \ntolvaptan and (b) hydroxypropylcellulose (hereafter , \"HPC\"). At oral argument, I rejected \nDefendants' construction of\"amorphous composites \" as \"amorphous solids.\" (Tr. at 68:20-21). I \nalso rejected Defendants' construction indicating that the amorphous composites are produced \n\"from\" tolvaptan and HPC. (Transc. at 88:21-24). The remaining dispute pertains to phrases that \nare meant to clarify the \"consisting of' transition: \na. Plaintiff's Proposed Construction:\" ... in an amount of 50% or greater, which \nmay include impurities and other elements unrelated to the amorphous composites \nof the invention \" \nb . Defendants' Proposed Construction: \" ... in an amount of 50% or greater, and no \nadditional excipients \" \nc. Court's Construction: \" ... in an amount of 50% or greater, and no additional \nexci pients\" \nThe parties disagree on what amorphous composites can contain besides tolvaptan and \nHPC. Defendants argue that amorphous composites contain \"no additional excipients \" because \nof the \"exclusionary aspects of the 'consisting of transitional phrase.\" (D.I. 53 at 46). Plaintiff \n3 Claim 1 is unique (in my experience) as its four steps are denominated as Step 1, Step A, Step \n2, and Step 3. \n6 acknowledges that the \"consisting of' transition signifies the exclusion of additional ingredients, \nbut argues that caselaw indicates that \"consisting of' does not exclude \"impurities\" or elements \n\"unrelated to the invention.\" (D.I. 53 at 40). \nI agree with Defendants' \"and no additional excipients\" construction. The \"consisting of' \ntransition \"exclude[ s] any elements, steps, or ingredients not specified in the claim.\" Multilayer \nStretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc. v. Berry Plastics Corp., 831 F.3d 1350, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \nHere, while the \"restriction is not absolute\" in that the amorphous composites can contain \nimpurities, see Conoco, Inc. v. Energy & Envtl. Int'/, L.C., 460 F.3d 1349, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2006), \nthe amorphous composites cannot consist of additional excipients. \nThe Federal Circuit has held that \"impurities normally associated with the component of \na claimed invention are implicitly adopted by the ordinary meaning of the components \nthemselves.\" Id. at 1361. Defendants do not dispute that the amorphous composites might \ncontain impurities such as residual organic solvents. (Tr. at 76:20-25). If the presence of \nimpurities is \"implicit[]\" in the ordinary meaning of the recited components, and the parties do \nnot dispute that impurities may be present, then there is no need to include impurities in the \nconstruction . 4 \nIn opposing Defendants' construction, Plaintiff argues that solvents are excipients and \nthat amorphous composites could contain residual solvents. (D.I. 53 at 41, 49-50). The Federal \nCircuit has held that \"excipients\" contrast with \"impurities\" in the pharmaceutical context. G/axo \nGrp. Ltd. v. Apotex, Inc., 376 F.3d 1339, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \"[E]xcipients are almost \nuniversally used with the active ingredient , and therefore do not act to affect the purity of the \n4 Any trial will be a bench trial (D.I. 16, 1 15), so making sure the jury will understand a term is \nnot an issue in this case. \n7 drug.\" Id While an \"impurity is considered an unwanted reaction product formed during \nsynthesis,\" excipients are \"inactive ingredients that are routinely and purposefully added to the \nactive ingredient to enhance the performance of the active ingredient.\" Id Here, though residual \nsolvents might be labelled \"excipients\" in certain contexts (see D.I. 56-1, Ex.Vat 4), they are \nnot \"excipients\" in the sense of \"purposefully added\" ingredients that \"enhance the performance\" \nof the active ingredient. Solvents also qualify as impurities to the extent that they are an \n\"unwanted reaction product.\" Therefore, residual solvents are not excluded by Defendants' \nconstruction. 5 \nIn support of its construction, Plaintiff cites the holding in Conoco that '\" consisting of \ndoes not exclude additional components or steps that are unrelated to the invention .\" 460 F.3d at \n1360. At oral argument , I asked Plaintiff to provide an example of something that is \"unrelated to \nthe amorphous composites of the invention \" that is not an impurity. Plaintiff provided \"organic \nsolvents\" as an example (Tr. at 51: 16-18, 53: 11-13) but conceded that residual organic solvents \nare impurities (Tr. at 54: 19-22). Plaintiff stated that \"excipients\" and \"carrier excipients \" are not \nrelated to the amorphous composites, but also stated that excipients are \"not part of the \namorphous composites\" and that the amorphous composites do not \"include[] the carrier.\" (Tr. at \n55: 16-19). Plaintiff suggested that the amorphous composites might be mixed with or else be \n\"on\" another excipient , even though the excipient is not \"part\" of the amorphous composite in \nthat case. (Tr. at 60:23-61 :2, 88:2-5). \n5 I construed \"consisting of' to indicate what the amorphous composites contain, not what they \nare produced from. Plaintiff stated at oral argument that in its construction of the term, \"we are \ntrying to make clear ... that you can have other excipients present when you're preparing these \namorphous composites.\" (Tr. at 56:23-57:1). I make no determination on this point, because I \nheld that this term states what the amorphous composites contain, not the conditions under which \nthe amorphous composites are produced. \n8 I agree that an excipient on which amorphous composites adhere is not excluded by the \n\"consisting of' transition. 6 An excipient on which the amorphous composites adhere is not \n\"related\" to the amorphous composites , as understood in Conoco. But if Xis \"on\" Y, then X \ndoes not \"consist of' Y. See Multilayer , 831 F.3d at 1366 (Taranto, J., dissenting in part) (\"As \nthe court's opinion explains, in patent law (and probably in the dominant strand of formal \nEnglish), 'consisting of means 'including only' ('containing only,' 'composed of only,' 'made \nof only').\"). Therefore , none of the examples Plaintiff provides are both (a) something of which \nthe amorphous composites consist (that is, something that is part of the amorphous composite) \nand (b) something unrelated to the amorphous composites .7 For this reason, Plaintiff has not \nexplained how amorphous composites could \"consist[] of ... elements unrelated to the \namorphous composites of the invention .\"8 \nA closer examination of the caselaw reveals why Plaintiffs construction fails to clarify \nthis term. The case Plaintiff relies on for its construction , Conoco, 460 F.3d at 1360-61, follows \nfrom an analysis of Norian Corp. v. Stryker Corp., 363 F.3d 1321, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2004). In \nNorian, the Federal Circuit held that \"consisting of' did not permit inclusion of additional \n6 To be clear, I am not making any factual findings about the disputes in this case. I am merely \nresponding to the hypotheticals as I understand them from oral argument. \n7 The closest Plaintiff comes to providing an example is that, in certain preparations of the \namorphous composite , excipients might \"bleed[] into the amorphous composite. \" (Tr. at 83:19-\n21, 83 :24-84:3). But even here, Plaintiff assumes that the excipient mixes with the amorphous \ncomposite, not that the amorphous composite \"consists of' an excipient that is unrelated to the \namorphous composite . \n8 Removing the intervening phrases, Plaintiffs constructi on ultimately states that \"amorphous \ncomposites consist[] of ... elements unrelated to the amorphous composites of the invention .\" \nBut Plaintiff does not explain what it is for something to \"consist of' elements unrelated to itself. \nThis paradox did not arise in Norian, where the spatula in question (the element unrelated to the \ninvention) was \"not part of the invention\" at all. See Norian, 363 F.3d at 1332. \n9 chemicals in a bone-repair kit. See Norian Corp. v. Stryker Corp., 363 F.3d 1321, 1332 (Fed. Cir. \n2004). The item that was \"irrelevant to the invention\" was not a chemical, but a \"spatula.\" Id. \nMoreover, the item that was irrelevant or unrelated to the invention was \"not part of the \ninvention at all.\" Id. Here, unlike in Norian, Plaintiff claims that chemicals unrelated to \namorphous composites are items of which the amorphous composites consist, even though they \nare not parts of the amorphous composite. But Plaintiff does not explain what it is for an \namorphous composite to \"consist of X\" if X is not a \"part\" of the amorphous composite. Because \nPlaintiff's construction relies on inapposite caselaw, I will not adopt it.9 \nIII. CONCLUSION \nThe claims shall be construed as set forth above. \nSO ORDERED this & day of July 2022. \n9 I think what Plaintiff is arguing is that anything contained in the amorphous composites that is \nneither tolvaptan nor hydroxypropylcellulose is unrelated to the amorphous composites of the \ninvention, thereby turning the \"consisting of' transition to a \"comprising\" transition. \n10 "}
