(D.I. 105).  As \nannounced in a teleconference held  on July 12, 2022 (D.I. 106) , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nthe disputed claim terms of the \u2019 293 P atent are construed as follows:  2 1. \u201cbeing properly sized and suited for surgical insertion\u201d  means \u201csized to \nallow and otherwise appropriate f or surgical insertion in a patient.\u201d  ( Claims \n1 and 6);  \n \n2. \u201cso that the tip enters a tibial bone to establish\u201d means \u201c insertion of the tip \ninto a tibial bone establishes. \u201d  (Claim 1 ); \n 3.  \u201can oblique hole passing through the shaft\u201d means \u201ca hole positioned at a \nslanted angle allowing the screw to pass through the shaft.\u201d   (Claim 1);  \n 4.  \u201callows the screw to establish compression of the tibial bone against the \ncalcaneal bone when the screw i s rotated \u201d (claim  1) and \u201cestablish \ncompression of the tibial bone against the calcaneal bone when the screw is rotated\u201d (claim 6) means \u201cthe rotation of the screw causes contact between and compression of the tibial bone against the calcaneal bone\u201d ; \n 5. \u201cwherein said angle is within a range of about 30 to about 50 degrees \u201d is \nnot indefinite .

(D.I. 92).  The Court carefully reviewed all submissions in connection with 3 the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the disputed claim terms, heard oral argument ( see D.I. 105)  and \napplied the following legal standards in reaching its decision. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Claim Construction  \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n135 S. Ct. 831, 837- 38 (2015).  \u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill \nin the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  Although \u201cthe claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms,\u201d the context of the surrounding words of the claim also must be considered.  Id.  at 1314.  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201ci s always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201cthe specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess.  In such cases, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201cEven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of \nthe patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d  Hill- Rom 4 Servs., Inc . v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201cshould also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201cintrinsic \nevidence,  . . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and \nTrademark Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\u201d  Phillips , \n415 F.3d at 1317. \u201c[T]he prosecution history can often inform the meani ng of the claim language \nby demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.\u201d  Id.  \nIn some cases, courts \u201cwill need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\u201d  Teva , 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrin sic evidence \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d  Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201cto ensure that the court\u2019s unde rstanding of the technical \naspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201cexpert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer \nfrom bias that is not present in intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id.   Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201cmay \nbe useful to the court,\u201d it is \u201cless reliable\u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201cis unlikely 5 to result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the \nintrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id. at 1318-19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof the patented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nB. Indefiniteness  \n\u201cThe primary purpose of the definiteness requirement is to ensure that the claims are \nwritten in such a way that they give notice to the public of the extent of the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, e.g. competitors of the patent owner, can \ndetermine whether or not they infringe.\u201d  All Dental Prodx, LLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779- 80 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing Warner -Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton- Davis Chem. Co., \n520 U.S. 17, 28- 29 (1997)).  Put another way, \u201c[a] patent holder should know what he owns, and \nthe public should know what he does not.\u201d  Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., Ltd., 535 U.S. 722, 731 (2002). \nA patent claim is indefinite if, \u201cvie wed in light of the specification and prosecution history, \n[it fails to] inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty.\u201d  Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2120, 2129 (2014).  A claim may be indefinite if the patent does not convey with reasonable certainty how to measure a claimed \nfeature.  See Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  But \u201c[i]f such an understanding of how to measure the claimed [feature]  was within the scope of \nknowledge possessed by one of ordinary skill in the art, there is no requirement for the specification to identify a particular measurement technique.\u201d  Ethicon Endo\u2013Surgery, Inc. v. Covidien, Inc., 796 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2015). 6 Like claim construction, definiteness is a question of law, but the Court must sometimes \nrender factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the ultimate issue of definiteness.  \nSee, e.g., Sonix Tech. Co. v. Publications Int\u2019l, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017); see also \nTeva , 135 S. Ct. at 842- 43.  \u201cAny fact critical to a holding on indefiniteness . . . must be proven \nby the challenger by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d  Intel Corp. v. VIA Techs., Inc., 319 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Tech.  Licensing Corp. v. Videotek, Inc. , 545 F.3d 1316, 1338 \n(Fed. Cir. 2008). \nII. THE COURT\u2019S RULING  \nThe Court\u2019s ruling regarding the disputed claim terms of the \u2019293 patent were announced \nduring a teleconference on July 12, 2022 as follows: \nAt issue we have nine disputed terms in one patent, U.S. Patent No. \n6,579,293.  I am prepared to rule on each of the disputes.  I will not be issuing a written opinion, but I will issue an order stating my rulings.  I want to emphasize before I announce my decisions that although I am not issuing a written opinion, we have followed a full and thorough process before making the decisions I am about to state.  I have reviewed the patent.  I have also reviewed the portions of the prosecution history, the expert declarations, dictionary definitions and the other references submitted.  There was full briefing on each of the disputed terms and we had argument last week.  All of that has been carefully considered. \nAs to my rulings, I am not going to read into the record my \nunderstanding of claim construction law.  I have a legal standard section that I have included in earlier opinions, including somewhat recently in CAO Lighting, Inc. v. General Electric Co., C.A. No. 20-681 (MN).  I incorporate that law and adopt it into my ruling today and will also set it out in the order that I issue.  \nThe first disputed term is \u201cbeing properly sized and suited for surgical insertion\u201d in claims 1 and 6.  Plaintiff proposes the construction \u201csized to allow for surgical insertion in a patient.\u201d Defendant proposes: \u201cproperly sized and labelled only for\u201d surgical insertion.  Here, although Plaintiff ignores the words \u201csuited for\u201d in its proposal, I think that Plaintiff\u2019s proposal is more correct and more consistent with the claim language.   7 Defendant argues that the specification and the prosecution history \nsupport its construction.  In the specification, Defendant points to a reference to labelling and to the statement \u201cthis invention claims a screw with certain traits . . . which \u2018is packag ed in a manner suited \nfor a surgical implant and labelled in a manner which indicates that \nit is a medical device intended for ankle arthrodesis.\u2019\u201d\n[1]  Although \nthe quoted portion addresses labeling,f  it does not make clear that \nsuited for means labeling.  To the contrary the packaging referenced \nmust be both suited for and labelled.  In any event, the claims at issue (claims 1 and 6) refer to various components being sized and suited for surgical insertion,\n[2] not the packaging.   \nDuring prosecution, the  applicant also focused on labelling, stating \nthat \u201cthe sole and explicitly limited used for the current invention is \nto enable a certain type of ankle repair, known as ankle \narthrodesis  . . .\u201d[3] and noting that the Medical Devices Act, a federal \nstatute , requires labelling of items to be inserted into a patient during \nsurgery.  The applicant then argued that \u201ca device that is going to be inserted into a patient, during surgery, must \u2013 absolutely must \u2013 be \naccompanied by labelling information which discloses what the device is,\u201d and added a few sentences later that \u201ca surgical rod as covered by the claims, which is designed for ankle implantation, must \u2013 absolutely must \u2013 be sold in a package which indicates that \nthe rod is to be used for an ankle repair.\u201d\n[4]  Again, the language \nreferences the packaging requirement, rather than the components of the device as claimed.   \nAccordingly, I will construe the first term to mean \u201csized to allow \nand otherwise appropriate for surgical insertion in a patient.\u201d  And \nto be clear that I am not construing this term to require labeling of the parts of the device claimed.  \nThe second disputed term is \u201cso that the tip enters a tibial bone to establish,\u201d which is present in claim 1.  Plaintiff proposes that the term be constr ued \u201cso the tip of the rod enters the tibial bone to allow \n \n1  (\u2019293 patent, 9: 1-5; see also  cl. 6 (\u201csaid screw is packaged in a manner suited for a surgical \nimplant and labelled in a manner . . .).   In this order, all  citations to a patent are to the \u2019293 \npatent ). \n \n2  (Cl. 1a (\u201crod being properly sized and suited\u201d); cl. 1b (\u201cscrew being properly sized  and \nsuited\u201d); cl . 6 (\u201cthreaded tip region being properly sized and suited\u201d) ). \n \n3  (D.I. 92, Ex. S at 2) . \n \n4  (Id). 8 for compression\u201d and Defendant would have this term read \u201cso that \ninsertion of the tip into a tibial bone is sufficient to establish.\u201d   \nFirst, some context.  In claim 1, the limitation containing this phrase \nreads: \u201cat least one tibio -calcaneal rod having a tip, a shaft, and a \nbase, said rod being properly sized and suited for surgical insertion \nthrough a calcaneal bone so that the tip enters a tibial bone to \nestablish tibio -calcaneal arthrodesis.\u201d[5]   \nHere, I think that Defendant\u2019s construction better aligns with the \nlanguage of the claim and the intrinsic evidence.  As I just noted, the \nclaim language states that the \u201ctip enters a tibial bone to establish \ntibio-calcaneal arthrodesis.\u201d[6]  Estab lish means \u201c to cause or bring \ninto being\u201d7 and the specification uses that word in various contexts \nconsistent with that ordinary meaning.[8]  The parties agreed that \ntibio-calcaneal arthrodesis means \u201cfusion of the tibia and calcaneal \nbones through a surgical procedure.\u201d  Thus, the ordinary meaning of the term is that the tip enters the bone during the surgical procedure to cause the fusion claimed.   \nThis is supported by t he specification, which explains that \nimmobilizing the ankle joint requires \u201cinserting one or more rigid \nrods or pins . . . into one or more bones in the ankle, and in the \n\u2018hindfoot\u2019 portion of the foot . . . The medical term for this type of \npermanent bon e fixation is \u2018arthrodesis.\u2019\u201d\n[9]  Elsewhere, the \nspecification explains that if the vertical rod is used by itself to immobilize the ankle joint, the fixation is called \u201ctibio -calcaneal \narthrodesis.\u201d\n[10] \nThus, Plaintiff\u2019s proposal \u201callow for compression\u201d is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the claim term and inconsistent with the \n \n5  (11:35\u201339) . \n \n6  (11:38\u201339) . \n \n7  (See D.I. 105 (Tr.) at 28- 29). \n \n8  (7:25- 26 (\u201cThis will help establish compression . . .\u201d); 2:45\u201349 (the anterior tip . . . of the \nhorizontal pin is slightly lower than the posterior tip . . . This establishes an obtuse angle \nbetween the rod and the pin[.]\u201d ); 8:52\u201355 (\u201cThe layers can be seal ed to each other by means \nof a peripheral seal, to establish a watertight and airtight enclosure that maintains sterility of the components inside the sealed envelope.\u201d) ). \n \n9  (1:13\u201320) . \n \n10  (2:33\u201334) . 9 specification, both of which require more than compression.[11]  \nThey require establishing arthrodesis.  I will adopt Defendant\u2019s \nconstruction and construe the term to mean \u201cinsertion of the tip into a tibial bone establishes.\u201d  I don\u2019t think we need to include sufficient in there \u2013 that seems redundant.  \nThe fifth term in the briefs is \u201cwherein said angle is within a range \nof about 30 to about 50 degrees\u201d in claim 2.  There is some asserted \nrelevance of this term to arguments made about the third briefed \nterm,\n[12] so I will address it before I get to the third.  Plaintiff \nproposes the construction \u201cwherein the angle of the oblique hole is within a range of about 30 to about 50 degrees.\u201d  Defendant argues that this term is indefinite because claim 1 (on which claim 2 depends) includes two \u201cangles,\u201d and it is not possible to tell which of these is referred to in claim 2.   \nThe two angles in claim 1 are:  \u201csaid screw being proper ly sized and \nsuited for surgical insertion at an angle  through a calcaneal bone  \n. . .\u201d\n[13] and \u201cwherein the oblique hole passes through the shaft of \nthe rod at an angle  with respect to the shaft.\u201d[14]  The question is \nwhether the patent informs, with reasonable certainty, which of \nthese angles is being referred to by claim 2.  \nPlaintiff argues that \u201csaid angle\u201d clearly refers to the angle of the oblique hole, as the specification states that \u201c[f]or most patients, the \npreferred angle between rod and screw wil l usually fall within a \nrange of about 30 to 50 degrees . . . Accordingly, vertical rods can \nbe provided with oblique holes at various angles, ranging from about \n30 degrees to about 50 degrees, and a surgeon can choose a vertical \nrod having an optimal angl e for a particular patient.\u201d\n[15]  Defendant \ndenies that the specification provides clarity, as, in Defendant\u2019s \nview, the specification refers to both an angle of a screw and an \n \n11  The specification does allow for additional steps  (see, e.g. , 5:42\u201346)  which describe \naffixing a rod with screws, but these steps are referred to as important for \u201ccaus[ing] the fixation of the two bones to be more secure and less subject to problems.\u201d   See 7:26\u201330.  \n \n12  Defendant believes term five is indefinite.  Plaintiff contends that term five, which is \npresent in claim two, is not indefinite because it refers to the angle of the oblique hole in claim one , which is the subject of the third disputed term .  Plaintiff\u2019s definiteness argument \nrelies in part on claim differentiation.  \n \n13  (11:44\u201349 (emphasis added) ). \n \n14  (11:50\u201351 (emphasis added) ). \n \n15  (6:31\u201346) .  10 angle of an oblique hole that passes through the shaft of the rod as \nbeing within 30 to 50 degrees.   \nDuring the argument, we had some colloquy about whether the measurement aspect of claim 2, i.e.  that the angle is \u201cmeasured \nbetween the tip of the rod and the tip of the screw\u201d added clarity.  I \ndon\u2019t know that we reached a definitive answer.  But I do know that \nfor a claim to be held invalid for indefiniteness, there must be clear \nand convincing evidence.\n[16]  And at this time, I find that Defendant \nhas not met its burden to show that this term is indefinite.  Should there still be a disagreement regarding this term in the future, Defendant may raise the issue as appropriate after full fact and expert discover y. \nNow, back to the third term, which is \u201can oblique hole passing through the shaft\u201d in claim 1.  Plaintiff proposes that the \u201coblique hole passing through the shaft\u201d means \u201ca hole positioned at a slanted angle allowing the screw to pass through the shaft.\u201d  Defendant proposes that that means \u201ca hole passing through the shaft at an angle of between 30 to 50 degrees.\u201d  \nHere, I agree with Plaintiff.  The specification describes the \u201coblique\u201d hole as having a \u201cslanted angle\u201d or being a \u201cslanted hole\u201d in differe nt places.\n[17]  And this description is consistent with the \nordinary meaning of \u201coblique.\u201d[18]  Defendant\u2019s proposal is based \non an embodiment describing a \u201cpreferred angle . . . within a range \nof about 30 to about 50 degrees.\u201d  That reference to a prefere nce is \ninsufficient to require reading that angle in an embodiment into the claim.  Accordingly, I adopt Plaintiff\u2019s construction. \nThe next dispute involves two similar terms relating to compression:  \n\u201callows the screw to establish compression of the tibia l bone against \nthe calcaneal bone when the screw is rotated\u201d in claim 1 and \u201cestablish compression of the tibial bone against the calcaneal bone when the screw is rotated\u201d in claim 6.  Plaintiff proposes that the first term means \u201callows rotation of the sc rew to pull the tibial bone \ntoward the calcaneal bone\u201d and the latter means \u201cpull the tibial bone toward the calcaneal bone as the screw is rotated.\u201d  Defendant proposes that both terms mean \u201ccauses compression of the tibial \n \n16  See Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U.S. 898, 912 n. 10 (invalidity defenses must be proved by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d) (citing Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. \nPartnership, 564 U.S. 91, 95 (2011) ). \n \n17  (3:45\u201354; 4:6\u20138; 5:49\u201357; 6:24\u201326) . \n \n18  (See D.I. 92, Exs. A, D, F, G, H (dictionary definitions of \u2018oblique.\u2019) ). 11 bone in the direction of and in contact with the calcaneal bone as a \nresult of the rotation of the screw.\u201d  \nNotwithstanding all the words in Defendant\u2019s proposal, the crux of \nthis dispute is whether the claim requires causing contact and compression between the tibial bone and the calcaneal bone or \nsimply pulling the tibial bone toward the calcaneal bone.  Here, I \nthink that the claims require more than pulling the bones some \nundetermined amount toward each other . \nFirst, that more than \u201cpulling\u201d is required seems clear from the language o f the claims themselves, which requires \u201ccompression of \nthe tibial bone against the calcaneal bone.\u201d\n[19]  It is also supported \nby the specification.  At column 10, lines 40- 48, it states: \nsubstantial pressure preferably should be placed on the horizontal b ase 232 of the jig 230, to press the \ncalcaneal bone firmly against the lower end of the \ntibial bone. Compression of the two bones against \neach other during the drilling step will help align the \nholes in the calcaneal and tibial bones properly, . . . . \nSimilarly, at column 7, lines 63- 67, it states that if a particular screw \ndesign is used, \u201cthe screw will cause the lower end of the tibial bone \nto be pulled farther toward (and therefore compressed harder \nagainst) the upper surface of the calcaneal bone.\u201d  These disclosures \ncontemplate the tibial and calcaneal bone being pressed against each \nother. \nPlaintiff contends that the specification permits the invention to be \nused on patients who have a talus bone, pointing to column 2, line \n57 through column 3, line 12 and Figure 2.\n[20]  Plaintiff argues that \nif a patient has a talus bone, the tibial and calcaneal bones will not be in contact.  That may be so, but when that is the case, the patentee knew how to say that.  For example, at column 4, lines 10- 13, the \n \n19  When an object is \u201ccompressed against\u201d another object, the two objects are in contact.  Indeed, Plaintiff itself submitted dictionary definitions that support this view and cut against its interpretation.  For example, Rando m House -Webster\u2019s College Dictionary \ndefines \u201ccompress\u201d as \u201cto press or squeeze together; force into less space\u201d and Merriam -\nWebster defines compress as \u201cto press or squeeze together.\u201d  ( D.I. 92, Exs. I, J ). \n \n20  Contrary to Plaintiff\u2019s argument, the specif ication explains that \u201cFIG. 2 is a side view of \nthe rod- and-screw assembly of this invention, showing vertical rod and oblique s crew \ninside the major bones of an ankle joint. In this drawing, the posterior portion of the talus bone has been degraded, and no longer s eparates the tibia from the calcaneum .\u201d  (4:25\u201330 \n(emphasis added)).  12 specification refers to compression of the lower end of the tibia bone \nagainst the talus and/or calcaneum.  In the claims, Plaintiff did not refer to the talus.  \nSo I will construe these terms to mean \u201cthe rotation of the screw causes contact between and compr ession of the tibial bone against \nthe calcaneal bone.\u201d  \nNext we have some related terms: \u201cin a region proximate to the base,\u201d \u201cproximal,\u201d and \u201cproximate to the base,\u201d which are in claims 4, 5, 8 and 9.  Each term uses some form of the word \u201cproximate\u201d to de scribe the location of a screw\u2019s external threads relative to the \nbase of the screw.  Plaintiff\u2019s position has changed a bit.  In its opening brief, Plaintiff asserted that the term did not need to be construed, but proposed \u201csufficiently close to the base  to allow for \nthe base to be secured but still separate\u201d to the extent that a construction were needed.  In its reply brief, Plaintiff argued that \u201cthe Court should either conclude that there is no need to define this term or should adopt the plain and ordinary meaning of \u2018proximate,\u2019 which is \u2018near.\u2019\u201d  Defendant on the other hand proposed \u201cclose to the base and spaced apart from the threaded tip region.\u201d  \nDefendant primarily relies on Figure 4, a depiction of a screw with \nexternal threads that are close to  the base and separated from a \nthreaded tip region.  It argues that Figure 4 supports its construction because all of the claims that include the disputed terms have screws \nwith both external threads and a threaded tip region.  Here, I think that Defendant  is improperly reading an embodiment into the \nclaims.  That is particularly inappropriate here, where the specification states that \u201cthreads can cover all or most of the entire surface of the oblique screw.\u201d\n[21]  I think that \u201cnear\u201d accurately \ndepicts the claim as written and discussed in the specification, and I will construe \u201cproximate\u201d or \u201cproximal\u201d in these terms to mean \u201cnear.\u201d  \nNext, we have the seventh and eighth briefed terms.  The parties \nargued these together and I will address them together.  Term  seven \nis \u201ca jig base component which will be positioned adjacent to a \nbottom surface of a patient\u2019s heel during a surgical operation.\u201d  Term eight is \u201ca jig arm component which will be positioned roughly parallel to a patient\u2019s tibia bone during a surgica l \noperation.\u201d  Both terms are in claim 11, which covers an apparatus.  \nDefendant contends that these terms are indefinite because they are \n \n21  (7:21\u201324) .  13 method steps in an apparatus claim.  Plaintiff disagrees and proposes \nconstructions.[22] \nHere, I agree with Plaintiff  that neither of these terms is indefinite.  \nI do not think that these claims are like those in IPXL Holdings, L.L.C. v. Amazon.com, Inc.\n[23]  Functional language describing \ncomponents of claims does not inject a method step into a system or \napparatus clai m when it represents capabilities of the component.[24]  \nI think that is what we have here.  The terms at issue do not require \nuser action, but rather are addressing what the apparatus is configured to do.  In claiming a system with \u201ca jig base component which will be positioned adjacent to a bottom surface of a patient\u2019s \nheel during a surgical operation,\u201d the claim covers what the jig base \ncomponent is configured to do, and not what a user must do.  For \nterm eight, similarly, a \u201cjig arm component which will be positioned roughly parallel to a patient\u2019s tibia bone during a surgical operation\u201d does not command user action, but instead describes the term\u2019s structure by reference to something that it is configured to do.  Read together, these terms describe the  structure of the claimed alignment \njig \u2013 the alignment jig must have a jig base that is positioned to be \nadjacent to a patient\u2019s heel while the jig arm is parallel to a patient\u2019s tibia bone, and vice versa.   \nAccordingly, I find that Defendant has not dem onstrated by clear \nand convincing evidence that the disputed terms are indefinite, and \nas Defendant did not really dispute Plaintiff\u2019s proposed constructions for terms seven and eight, I will adopt those proposals. \nThe final term is in element (d) of claim 11.  The parties agree that \nthe \u201cmeans for engaging the vertical rod\u201d is a means -plus-function \nelement.  The dispute centers on what structure is disclosed in the \nspecification.  Plaintiff proposed \u201ca rotatable shaft having external threads at an upper en d, a sleeve having a set of alignment fins at an \nupper end, and a knurled surface or shaped flattened head to allow for gripping and rotating of the shaft during operation, wherein the \n \n22  Plaintiff proposes that term seven be construed as \u201ca jig base component which will be positioned sufficiently close to a bottom surface of a patient\u2019s heel to  allow for adjoinment \nduring surgery.\u201d  (D.I. 91 at 55).  For term eight, Plaintiff proposed \u201ca jig arm component sufficiently parallel to a patient\u2019s tibia bone to allow for drilling and proper alignment with screws.\u201d  ( Id. at 68).   \n \n23  430 F.3d 1377 (Fe d. Cir. 2005). \n \n24  See, e.g., MasterMine Software, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp, 874 F.3d 1307, 1315 (Fed. Cir. \n2017) ; Microprocessor Enhancement Corp. v. Texas Instruments Inc.,  520 F.3d 1367 (Fed. \nCir. 2008). 14 \nrotatable shaft is rotatable within the sleeve.\u201d[25]  Defendant \npropose d \u201ca rod coupling bolt comprising a rotatable shaft having \nexternal threads at an upper end, a sleeve having a set of alignment \nfins at an upper end, and a knurled surface or shaped flattened head to allow for gripping and rotating of the shaft during oper ation to \nloosen or tighten the external threads with respect to accommodating threads within the vertical rod sufficient to disengage the alignment fins from accommodating slots inside a shaft of the vertical rod, wherein the rotatable shaft is rotatable within the sleeve, wherein the rod coupling bolt:\u201d  \nHere, I agree with Plaintiff.  Defendant\u2019s proposal adds functional \nlanguage that is not necessary in describing the structure.\n[26]  I will \nconstrue this term to mean \u201ca rotatable shaft having external threads at an upper end, a sleeve having a set of alignment fins at an upper end, and a knurled surface or shaped flattened head, wherein the rotatable shaft is rotatable within the sle eve and equivalents \nthereof.\u201d  \n  \n              \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika        United States District Judge  \n \n \n25  D uring the argument, when the Court pointed out that the objection to some purportedly \nfunctional language in Defendant\u2019s was inconsistent with Plaintiff\u2019s proposal to include \n\u201cto allow for gripping and rotation of the shaft during operation,\u201d Plaintiff dro pped the \nlanguage from its proposal.  (D.I. 105 at 74:23\u201375:10). \n \n26  Defendant\u2019s proposal also includes \u201crod coupling bolt\u201d in the construction.  I do not include \nthese as  the limitation already includes the term \u201crod coupling component.\u201d "}
