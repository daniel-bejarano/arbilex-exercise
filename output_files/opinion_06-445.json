No. 06-445-GBW\nROBERT MAY, Warden, andthe:\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPending before the Court is Petitioner Ralph Reed\u2019s (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) fifth Rule\n60(b) Motion for Reconsideration of the denial of his initial habeas Petition. (D.I.\n79) For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the Motion.\n0. BACKGROUND\n\nIn 2000, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of first degree\nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. (D.I. 29 at\n2) In 2006, Petitioner filed a Petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254 seeking relief from his Delaware state convictions for first degree\nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. (D.I. 1)\n\nThe Petition asserted seventeen grounds for relief. On January 3, 2007, the\nHonorable Joseph J. Farnan, Jr. denied the Petition after concluding that it was\ntime-barred by the one-year statute of limitations prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.\n(D.I. 29; D.I. 30)\n\nThereafter, Petitioner filed a motion to alter judgment, alleging that the\nCourt erred by not equitably tolling the limitations period on the basis of his actual\ninnocence; the Court denied the motion. (DI. 31; D.I. 34) Petitioner then\nappealed the denial of his Petition as time-barred. In March, 2008 the Court of\nAppeals declined to issue a certificate of appealability and terminated the appeal.\n(D.I. (D.I. 35; D.I. 39) Petitioner subsequently filed four Rule 60(b) Motions for\nReconsideration, which the Court denied. (D.I. 40; D.I. 41; D.I. 47; D.I. 48; D.I.\n56; D.I. 57; D.I. 58; D.I. 69; D.I. 70)\n\nIn December 2021, Petitioner filed a Rule 60(b) Motion alleging that he has\nnewly discovered evidence of his actual innocence and, therefore, the dismissal of\nhis Petition as time-barred should be reconsidered. (D.I. 79 at 2)\n\nIl. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) provides that a party may file a\n\u2018motion for relief from a final judgment for the following reasons:\n\n(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\n\n(2) newly discovered evidence, that with reasonable\ndiligence, could not have been discovered in time to move\n\n2\nfor a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether\n\npreviously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation\n\nor other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment\n\nis void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or\n\ndischarged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been\n\nreversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no\n\nlonger equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies\n\nrelief.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). A Rule 60(b)(2) motion seeking relief on the basis of\n\u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d must be filed no more than a year after the entry of\nthe judgment, order, or date of proceeding. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). A Rule\n60(b)(6) motion seeking relief for \u201cany other reason\u201d must be filed within a\n\u201creasonable time,\u201d which is determined by considering the interest of finality, the\nreason for delay, the practical ability of the litigant to learn earlier of the grounds\nrelied upon, and the consideration of prejudice, if any, to other parties. See Dietsch\nv. United States, 2 F. Supp. 2d 627, 633 (D.N.J. 1988). As a general rule, a Rule\n60(b)(6) motion filed more than one year after final judgment is untimely unless\n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d excuse the party\u2019s failure to proceed sooner. See, -\ne.g., Moolenaar v. Gov't of the V.I., 822 F.2d 1342, 1348 (3d Cir.1987) (Rule\n60(b)(6) motion filed almost two years after judgment was not made within a\n\nreasonable time).\nA motion filed pursuant to Rule 60(b) is addressed to the sound discretion of\nthe trial court guided by accepted legal principles applied in light of all relevant\ncircumstances. See Pierce Assoc., Inc. v. Nemours Found., 865 F.2d 530, 548 (3d\nCir. 1988). When considering a Rule 60(b)(6) motion, a court must use a \u201cflexible,\nmultifactor approach ... that takes into account all the particulars of a movant's\ncase.\u201d Cox v. Horn, 757 F.3d 113, 122 Gd Cir. 2014). Granting such a motion,\nhowever, is warranted only in the \u201cextraordinary circumstance[ ] where, without\nsuch relief, an extreme and unexpected hardship would occur.\u201d Jd. at 120. A Rule\n60(b) motion is not appropriate to reargue issues that the court has already\nconsidered and decided. Brambles USA Inc. v. Blocker, 735 F. Supp. 1239, 1240\n(. Del. 1990).\n\nAdditionally, when, as here, a district court is presented with a Rule 60(b)\nmotion after it has denied the petitioner\u2019s federal habeas petition, the court must\nfirst determine if the Rule 60(b) motion constitutes a second or successive\napplication under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d).\nAs articulated by the Third Circuit:\n\nin those instances in which the factual predicate of a\npetitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion attacks the manner in\nwhich the earlier habeas judgment was procured and not\n\nthe underlying conviction, the Rule 60(b) motion may be\nadjudicated on the merits. However, when the Rule 60(b)\n\n4\nmotion seeks to collaterally attack the petitioner\u2019s\n\nunderlying conviction, the motion should be treated as a\n\nsuccessive habeas petition.\nPridgen v. Shannon, 380 F.3d 721, 727 (3d Cir. 2004). In Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545\nU.S. 524, 529 (2005), the Supreme Court provided several examples of Rule 60(b)\nmotions that were actually habeas claims, including a motion seeking leave to\npresent newly discovered evidence, a motion attacking the effectiveness of trial\ncounsel, and a motion seeking relief for \u201cany other reason\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6).\nId. at 531.\n\nUnder AEDPA, a prisoner cannot file a second or successive habeas petition\nwithout first obtaining approval from the Court of Appeals. Absent such\nauthorization, a district court cannot consider the merits of a subsequent petition.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A); Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128,139-40 (3d Cir.\n2002).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nPetitioner asserts that he has \u201cnewly discovered evidence of his actual\ninnocence\u201d warranting reconsideration of the 2007 dismissal of his Petition as\ntime-barred. (D.I. 29; D.I. 30). (D.I. 79 at 1) The alleged newly discovered\nevidence is an affidavit provided by witness Jerome Reed that Petitioner included\n\nin his \u201cpreviously submitted habeas petition.\u201d (D.I. 79 at 4) Petitioner describes\n\n5\nthe affidavit as asserting that the \u201cState\u2019s eyewitness Yvonne DeShields, who\ntestified that she [Petitioner] shoot the victim, was actually one of the culprits in\nthe shooting. The affidavit also alleges Kenyon Horsey and Yvonne DeShields\ncommitted this offense and not [Petitioner].\u201d (/d.)\n\nTo the extent the instant Rule 60(b) Motion could be treated as a true motion\nfor reconsideration filed pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), the Motion is untimely.\nPetitioner filed the Motion more than one-year after the September 25, 2007 denial\nof his original Petition. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1) (establishing a one-year\ndeadline for motions filed under Rule 60(b)(2)).\n\nIn addition, to the extent Petitioner asserts that his \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim\nserves as a gateway claim under McQuiggan v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383 (2013) to\novercome the statute of limitations bar and constitutes an extraordinary\ncircumstance sufficient to satisfy Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s or Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard, his\nargument is unavailing. The McQuiggin Court cautioned that \u201ctenable actual-\ninnocence gateway pleas are rare,\u201d and a petitioner only meets the threshold\nrequirement by \u201cpersuad[ing] the district court that, in light of the new evidence,\nno juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find him guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\u201d McQuiggin, 569 U.S. at 386. An actual innocence claim must\n\nbe based on \u201cnew reliable evidence \u2014 whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence,\n\n6\ntrustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence [] that was not\npresented at trial.\u201d Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 324 (1995). Notably, evidence is\nnot \u201cnew\u201d for purposes of establishing actual innocence \u201cif it was available at trial,\nbut a petitioner merely chose not to present it to the jury.\u201d Goldblum v. Klem, 510\nF.3d 204, 226 n.14 (3d Cir. 2007). Finally, \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d will only\nwarrant relief under Rule 60(b)(2) if it: (1) is material and not merely cumulative;\n(2) could not have been discovered before trial through the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence; and (3) would probably have changed the outcome of the trial.\u201d In re\nFlonase Antitrust Litig., 879 F.3d 61, 70 (3d Cir. 2017).\n\nThe so-called \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d Petitioner presents with the\ninstant Motion \u2014 Jerome Reed\u2019s affidavit \u2014 fails on all counts. Petitioner included\nthe affidavit with his initial Petition that was filed in 2006, and Judge Farnan\nexplicitly concluded that the affidavit did not constitute new reliable evidence of\nPetitioner\u2019s actual innocence that could equitably toll the limitations period. (D.I.\n29 at 7-8) In short, Jerome Reed\u2019s affidavit is neither \u201cnewly discovered\u201d nor\nevidence of his \u201cactual innocence.\u201d Additionally, Petitioner has not identified\n\u201cextraordinary circumstances where, without such relief [of re-opening his habeas\nproceeding], an extreme and unexpected hardship would occur.\u201d Cox v. Horn, 757\n\nF.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir. 2014). Thus, to the extent the instant Motion could be\n7\ntreated as a true Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration, the Court denies it for\nfailing to satisfy the requirements of Rule 60(b)(2) and Rule 60(b)(6).\n\nInstead, the Court concludes that the instant Motion constitutes a second or\nsuccessive habeas request for purposes of \u00a7 2244. First, the Motion challenges the\nsame 2000 convictions that Petitioner challenged in his first federal habeas\nPetition. Second, the dismissal of Petitioner's first Petition as time-barred\nconstitutes an adjudication on the merits. See Rohn v. Horton, 508 F. App'x 170,\n171 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201cRohn previously filed a \u00a7 2254 petition that was dismissed as\nuntimely, and, because that disposition counts as a ruling on the merits for\npurposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b), he must seek permission from this Court to file a\nsecond or successive habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d); Thomas v. Pierce,\n2017 WL 359165, at *1 (D. Del. Jan. 23, 2017) (noting that dismissal of first\nhabeas petition as time-barred \u201cconstitutes an adjudication on the merits for the\npurposes of the gate-keeping rules on second or successive applications\u201d). And\nthird, Petitioner presented his instant allegation of actual innocence in his initial\nPetition.\n\nThe record indicates that Petitioner did not obtain permission from the Third\n\nCircuit before filing the instant Motion/successive habeas request. Therefore, the\nCourt will dismiss the instant Motion/successive habeas request for lack of\njurisdiction.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the Court will dismiss the instant Rule\n60(b) Motion for Reconsideration. The Court also declines to issue a certificate of\nappealability, because Petitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the\ndenial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see United States v. Eyer,\n\n113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997); 3d Cir. LAR 22.2 (2011). A separate Order will be\n\nentered.\n\nDated: September 7 , 2022 | tus,\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nRALPH REED,\n\nPetitioner,\n\nv. i Civ.
