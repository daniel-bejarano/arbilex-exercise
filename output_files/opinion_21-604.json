To avoid needless toil,  courts \ncan stay one until the other is resolved . I will do that here.  2 Lordstown Motors is a new public company that plans  to make electric pickup \ntrucks . D.I. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 2\u20134. It boasted that  consumers would swarm to buy the trucks it \nwould soon deliver . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6\u20137, 9, 11\u2013 13. So investors  bought its stock . Id. \u00b6 10. \nBut Lordstown  may have exaggerated  how quickly it could make  the trucks and \nhow many  people would  want them . Id. \u00b6 14. So a shareholder class sued  the company  \nin Ohio , alleging securities fraud. Consol . Am. Compl., Rico v. Lordstown Motors \nCorp. , No. 21 -616 (N.D. Oh. Sept. 10, 2021) (D.I. 61).  Then, other shareholders sued \nLordstown leaders in  Delaware , alleging that they had contribut ed to that fraud , \nbreached  fiduciary duties , and unjust ly enrich ed themselves . D.I. 25 \u00b6  1.  \nLordstown  moved to dismiss the Ohio case.  Mot. to Dismiss, Rico , No. 21 -616 (N.D. \nOh. Nov. 9, 2021)  (D.I. 70 ).  Now i t asks me to stay the Delaware case until the Ohio \nCourt decides its motion . D.I. 2 8. The shareholders never  answered . Because a stay \nwill avoid prejudice while streamlining this case, I will grant the motion.  \nI have discretion  to decide motions to stay . Janklow ex rel.  Stericycle, Inc. v. Alutto , \n2018 WL 6499869, at *2 (D. Del. Dec. 11, 2018) (citing Cost Bros., Inc. v. Travelers \nIndem. Co. , 760 F.2d 58, 60 (3d Cir. 1985)). I  ask if a  stay would prejudice the \nshareholders , simplify the case, and promote  judicial economy. Id.  Here, each fa ctor \nfavor s a stay.  \nA temporary stay will not prejudice the shareholders. Mere delay does not cause \nthem \u201cundue hardship.\u201d In re Twitter, Inc. , 2018 WL 3536085, at *3 (D. Del. July 23, \n2018). Plus, t his is a derivative action : the shareholders sued  Lordstown leaders  on \nbehalf of  the company, and any relief goes to Lordstown.  So all parties  benefit from 3 avoiding  needless  expense. Continuing this case makes  Lordstown battle on two \nfronts: in Ohio and here in Delaware. That drains  company resources and could  force \nLordstown  to take conflicting positions . Alutto , 2018 WL 6499869, at *2. So a stay \navoids prejudice.  \nPlus, a stay may simplify this case. The Ohio motion threatens to sink the class\u2019s \nclaims . Rico, D.I. 70 -1 at 13, 28, 33, 38\u2013 39. If there is no securities fraud,  then \nshareholders might drop their contribution claims. After all, you can contribute to \nfraud  only if there is a fraud  in the first place.  D.I. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 206\u2013 12; Consol. Am. Compl. , \nRico, D.I. 61  \u00b6\u00b6 451\u2013 68. And this action brings identical Exchange Act claims against \nsome of  the same defendants. D.I. 25 \u00b6\u00b6  196\u2013 205; Consol.  Am. Compl. , Rico, D.I. 61  \n\u00b6\u00b6 469\u2013 90. So staying this case until the Ohio motion is resolved will focus this \nCourt\u2019s attention on the surviving claims . \nLast, a stay promotes judicial economy. Litigating th is derivative contribution \nclaim duplicate s efforts in Ohio . See Alutto , 2018 WL 6499869, at *2. And since this \ncase \u201cis in its infancy, \u201d staying  it now does not waste spent resources. I d.  \n* * * * * \nA stay avoids prejudice, likely simplifies matters, and conserves court resources. \nAnd t he shareholders never disagreed . So I grant the motion to stay until the Ohio \nCourt decides the motion to dismiss .  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nIn re LORDSTOWN MOTORS CORP.  \nSHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE \nLITIGATION  \n \n  \n  \nLead Case No. 1:21- cv-00604- SB \n(Consolidated with Case Nos. 1:21 -cv-\n00724- SB, 1:21- cv-00910- SB, and 1:21-\ncv-01010- SB) \n \n \n  ORDER  \nThe motion to stay  (D.I. 28) is GRANTED .
