NEWMAN , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCHRIS (\"DSCYF\"), \nDefendant. : Civil Action No. 22-168-RGA \nShantell D. Newman, Wilmington , Delaware . Pro Se Plaintiff. \nApril Li , 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Shantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis. (0.1. 4). She filed this case on February 7, 2022 alleging \nviolations of her right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution . (0.1. 2, 0.1. 2-1 ). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) . \nBACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff refers to an occurrence date of February 7, 2017, \nwhen the Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families came to her \nhome and harassed her. (0.1. 2 at 4). That same year, the police executed a warrant at \nPlaintiff's home, she was arrested, and her children removed from the home. (Id. at 5). \nPlaintiff seeks a reversal of the termination of parental rights as well as compensatory \ndamages. (Id. at 6-7). \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious , fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \na prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \n1 Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds prose, her \npleading is liberally construed and her Complaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. \nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94. \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \n\"fantastic or delusional\" factual scenario. \"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(8)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscherv . McCullough , 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. \n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions . \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not \ndismissed , however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted. See id. at 11 . \n2 A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations , assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane \nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\" Id. \nDISCUSSION \nFor purposes of the statute of limitations , \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as \npersonal injury actions. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985). In Delaware , \n\u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two-year limitations period. See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119; \nJohnson v. Cullen, 925 F. Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996). Section 1983 claims accrue \n\"when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which its action is \nbased.\" Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia , 142 F.3d 582,599 (3d Cir. 1998). \nThe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that generally must be raised \nby the defendant , and it is waived if not properly raised. See Benak ex rel. Alliance \nPremier Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P., 435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir. \n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon, 807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986). \"Although \nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua sponte dismissal is appropriate \nwhen 'the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual \n3 record is required to be developed. \"' Davis v. Gauby, 408 F. App'x 524, 526 (3d Cir. \n2010) (quoting Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)). Accordingly a \ncourt may dismiss a time-barred complaint sua sponte. \nThe Complaint alleges wrongful acts occurred in 2017. Plaintiff did not \ncommence this action until February 7, 2022. It is evident from the face of the \nComplaint that all claims are barred by the two-year limitation period. Therefore , the \nComplaint will be dismissed . \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) as time-barred . The Court finds amendment futile. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCHRIS (\"DSCYF\"), \nDefendant. : Civil Action No. 22-168-RGA \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 28th day of April, 2022, for the reas_ons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date; \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) as \ntime-barred . Amendment is futile. \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case. "}
