(together with certain \naffiliates, \"Debtors\"), a Texas-based petrochemical company. Appellants Bayside Capital, Inc. and \nCerberus Capital Management , L.P. (\"Appellants\") filed a complaint for declaratory judgment , \ninitiating the above-captioned adversary proceeding , 1 and later sought summary judgment to \nadjudicate their purported rights under applicable loan documents. The dispute is over the \nconstruction of a 2019 indenture governing $930 million in notes (\"10.5% Notes\") issued by the \nDebtor. The fundamental question is whether a series of amendments to the 2019 indenture, made \nin 2021, which sought to authorize a new loan that would come in senior to the 10.5% Notes, were \nconsistent with the terms of the 2019 indenture. Appellants have appealed the Bankruptcy Court's \nJuly 6, 2022 Memorandum Opinion (Adv. D.I. 72; Appx Ex. 1), and the accompanying July 8, 2022 \nOrder (Adv. D.I. 74; Appx 2) and Judgment (Adv. D.I. 75; Appx 3), which held that the 2021 \namendments comported with the terms of the 2019 indenture , denied Appellants' summary \njudgment motion, and granted the cross-motion for summary judgment filed by the Ad Hoc \nNoteholder Group (as intervenors) . \nPending before the Court is Appellants ' Emergency Motion for Stay of Effectiveness and \nEnforcement of Order and Judgment Pending Appeal (D.I. 1, 4, 25, 27) (\"Emergency Stay \nMotion\") , which seeks a stay of the Order and Judgment pending an expedited appeal. Critically , \nsuch a stay would further delay the Bankruptcy Court's ability to approve, on a final basis, the \nDebtors' proposed debtor-in possession (\"DIP\") financing. Debtors and the Ad Hoc Noteholder \n1 The docket of the adversary proceeding , captioned Bayside Capital, Inc. et al. v. TPC Grp. Inc., \nAdv. No. 22-50372 (CTG) (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"Adv. D.I. _,\" and the docket of the \nChapter 11 cases, captioned In re TPC Group Inc., No. 22-10493-CTG (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited \nherein as \"B.D.I. _.\" Exhibits to the Appellants' appendix (D.I. 4) filed in support of the \nEmergency Stay Motion is cited herein as \"Appx Ex._.\" \n2 Group (\"Appellees\") filed a consolidated opposition to the Emergency Stay Motion. (D.I. 10). \nAlso pending before the Court is Appellants ' Emergency Motion to Expedite Appeal (D.l. 7) \n(\"Emergency Motion to Expedite \"), which seeks an order setting an expedited schedule for briefing \nand argument of the merits of the appeal. 2 Appellees filed a consolidated opposition to that motion \nas well. (D.I. 12). The Emergency Motions are fully briefed. For the reasons set forth herein, the \nCourt will deny both Emergenc y Motions. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe Memorandum Opinion contains a detailed description of the factual and procedural \nbackground of this dispute. (Mem. Op. 1-14). Because I write primarily for the parties, and am \nruling on an expedited basis, this background is not repeated herein. No party contends that there is \na disputed question of fact, and all parties agreed that the question before the Bankruptcy Court was \n\"a pure question of contractual interpretation that can be resolved on the undisputed factual record \nbefore the Court.\" (Mem. Op. 15). \nA. The 2019 10.5% Notes Indenture \nTPC issued the 10.5% Notes on August 2, 2019, with a face amount of $930 million. The \nterms of the 10.5% Notes, and the rights and responsibilities of TPC, the noteholders , the Trustee \n(U.S. National Bank), and various guarantors are set forth in an Indenture signed that same day (D.I. \n10 Ex. 4) (the \"10.5% Notes Indenture \"). New York law governs the 10.5% Notes Indenture. (Id.\u00a7 \n14). Three provisions of the 10.5% Notes Indenture are particularly relevant here. \nFirst, the default rule, set out in Section 9.02(a), allows TPC and U.S. Bank, as trustee and \ncollateral agent, to amend or supplement the 10.5% Notes Indenture or 10.5% Notes with the \nconsent of only a simple majority of the holders of the outstanding principal. Section 9.02(a) \n2 The appeal of the Order was filed separately from the Emergency Motions and is pending at Civ. \nNo. 22-927-RGA. \n3 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \nExcept as provided in this Section 9.02, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee \nand, if applicable , the Collateral Agent, may amend or supplement this Indenture \n(including , without limitation , Sections 4.08 and 4.12 hereof) and the Notes or the \nNote Guarantees with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate \nprincipal amount of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single class (including , \nwithout limitation , consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange \noffer for, or purchase of, the Notes) .... \n(Id. \u00a7 9.02(a)). Second, Section 9.02(e) addresses amendments and modifications which have the \neffect of releasing the collateral or modifying the 2019 Intercreditor Agreement (defined below), \nupon the approval of two-thirds , i.e., a super-majority , of the holders the outstanding principal : \nAny amendment to, or waiver of, the provisions of this Indenture , any Security \nDocument or any other indenture governing Permitted Additional Pari Passu \nObligations that has the effect of releasing all or substantiall y all of the Collateral \nfrom the Liens securing the Notes or otherwise modifies the Intercreditor Agreement \nor other Security Documents in any manner adverse in any material respect to the \nHolders will require the consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate \nprincipal amount of the Notes and any Permitted Additional Pari Passu Obligations \nthen outstanding. \n(Id. \u00a7 9.02(e)). Third, Section 9.02(d) sets forth the instances where unanimous consent is required. \nThese \"sacred rights\" include situations where amendments generally impact the amount of \nprincipal , the way principal is repaid, or \"change the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement or \nthis Indenture dealing with the application of proceeds of Collateral that would adversely affect the \nHolders.\" (Id. at\u00a7 9.02(d)(l)-(10) (emphasis added)). \nSection 4.07 of the 10.5% Notes Indenture expressly provides for the incurrence of \nadditional debt by TPC. (See\u00a7 4.07). Section 4.07(b)(l) provides for the incurrence of debt \"not to \nexceed the greater of ... $300.0 million and ... the Borrowing Base.\" (Id. at\u00a7 4.07(b)(l) ). \nLikewise , Section 4.07(b)(15) provides for TPC's incurrence of additional debt \"not to exceed the \ngreater of ... $50 million and ... 5.0% of Total Assets.\" (Id. at\u00a7 4.07(b)(15)). \nB. 2019 Intercreditor Agreement \nAt the same time that TPC issued the 10.5% Notes, it also entered into an asset-based \n4 revolving loan facility (referred to as the \"ABL facility\") with an availability of up to $200 million \n(subject to a borrowing base), under which Bank of America served as administrative agent and \ncollateral agent. The ABL facility was secured by a first lien on the Debtors' accounts receivable , \ndeposit accounts, inventory , and other assets, and a second lien on those assets that secure the \n10.5% Notes. Because the holders of the 10.5% Notes also took a security interest in the same \ncollateral-though , with respect to the accounts receivable and deposit accounts, one that was junior \nto that held by the lenders under the ABL facility-the parties also entered into an intercreditor \nagreement setting forth the parties' respective rights. (Appx Ex. 21) (\"2019 Intercreditor \nAgreement\" ). Section 4. l(a) of the 2019 Intercreditor Agreemen t explains that the holders of the \n10.5% Notes are paid first out of the proceeds of the collateral as to which those holders have a \nsenior lien, with the lenders of the ABL facility being paid second. The priority of payment is \nreversed with respect to accounts receivable, deposit accounts, inventory, and other assets as to \nwhich the lenders under the ABL facility have a first lien. For that collateral , the proceeds are paid \nfirst to the lenders under the ABL facility, with the holders of the 10.5% Notes being paid second. \nC The 2021 Transaction \nAfter the issuance of the 10.5% Notes, TPC's business and liquidity was impacted by \nseveral adverse events. To address its need for greater liquidity, in February 2021, TPC issued $153 \nmillion in new notes, maturing in 2024 and bearing interest at 10.875 percent (\"10.875% Notes\"). \n(See (D.I. 10 Ex. 7) (\"10.875% Notes Indenture \"). In 2022, TPC issued an additional tranche of \n$51.5 million in 10.875 percent notes, on substantiall y the same terms as those issued in 2021. The \nparties intended for these tranches of 10.875% Notes to be secured by the same collateral as the \n10.5% Notes, but with a lien that would become senior to the lien securing the 10.5% Notes, thus \nnecessitating various amendments to the 10.5% Notes Indenture and the 2019 Intercreditor \nAgreement. Because, however, at the time of the 2021 transactions , the holders under the 10.875% \n5 Notes also held a majority (indeed, a super-majority of more than 67 percent) of the then\u00ad\noutstanding 10.5% Notes, they had the authority to amend the 10.5% Notes Indenture in any way \nthat did not violate a holder's \"sacred rights\" set out in\u00a7 9.02(d) of that indenture. \nTo allow for the issuance, TPC amended the 10.5% Notes Indenture by executing a \nsupplemental indenture. (D.I. 10 Ex. 5) (\"Supplemental Indenture \"). The Supplemental Indenture \ncontains amendments to the 10.5% Notes Indenture intended to permit the issuance of the 10.875% \nNotes. The parties also entered into a new intercreditor agreement (D.I. 10 Ex. 8) (\"2021 \nIntercreditor Agreement \") which operates to subordinate the 10.5% Notes to the 10.875% Notes \nwith respect to the common collateral securing both sets of notes. The consents executed by more \nthan 67% of the holders of the 10.5% Notes authorized the entry into both the Supplemental \nIndenture and the 2021 Intercreditor Agreement. \nAppellants acquired their less than 10% interest in the 10.5% Notes through purchases made \nbetween July 2021 and January 2022-i.e., months after the issuance of the first tranche of 10.875% \nNotes. On March 31, 2022, prior counsel for Appellants sent a letter to TPC' s counsel asserting \nthat the 10.875% Notes, Supplemental Indenture , and 2021 Intercreditor Agreement were \nineffective. \nD. The Chapter 11 Cases Adversary Proceeding \nTPC continued to experience challenges after the issuance of the 10.875% Notes. On June \n1, 2022 (\"Petition Date\"), each of the Debtors commenced a voluntary case under chapter 11 of the \nBankruptcy Code. Debtors filed motions to approve a proposed DIP loan and restructuring support \nagreement (\"RSA\"). On June 2, 2022, Appellants filed the adversary proceeding alleging that TPC \nbreached the 10.5% Notes Indenture and 2019 Intercreditor Agreement and seeking a declaratory \njudgment invalidating Supplemental Indenture , 10.875% Notes Indenture , and 2021 Intercreditor \nAgreement. Appellants requested expedited consideration of the adversary proceeding so that their \n6 claims could be considered prior to final approval of the Debtors' DIP financing including a term \nloan from the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group.3 (Appx 25, B.D.I. 148 (\"6/2/2022 Tr.\") at 84:15-85 :4). \nBecause the DIP loan would \"roll up\" the 10.875% Notes that purport to be senior to the 10.5% \nNotes, the question was whether the 10.875% notes are actually senior, or were (as Appellants \ncontend) junior to the 10.5% Notes on account of a violation of the 10.5% Notes Indenture. The \nBankruptc y Court agreed to fast track the adversary proceeding . \nThe Memorandum Opinion, issued on July 6, 2022, following expedited discovery , briefing, \nand argument , rejected Appellants ' challenge to the 2021 transaction as a matter of law and held \nthat Section 9.02(d)(10) of the 10.5% Notes Indenture-the \"sacred right\" provision dealing with \nthe \"application of proceeds to Collateral\"-addressed only the ratable distribution of proceeds to \nnoteholders in a class, and \"should not be read as an anti-subordination provision in disguise.\" \n(Mem. Op. 27-28). The Bankruptcy Court then issued an Order and Judgment consistent with the \nOpinion on July 8, 2022. \nE. The Initial Stay Motion \nThe same day, Appellants filed their notice of appeal and moved the Bankruptcy Court for a \nstay pending appeal of the Order and Judgment. (Adv. D.I. 79). On July 11, 2022, the Bankruptcy \nCourt issued a decision denying the request (Adv. D.I. 88) (\"Initial Stay Decision\").4 \nWith respect to Appellants ' likelihood of success on the merits, the Bankruptcy Court \n3 Pursuant to the DIP Motion, the Debtors seek authority to obtain secured post-petition financing \nconsisting of (i) a secured asset-based revolving credit facility in a maximum committed amount of \nup to $200 million (the \"ABL DIP Facility\") and (ii) a priming secured term loan facility in an \naggregate amount of $323 million (the \"Term DIP Facility\"). \n4 Although the Order is a declaratory judgment , the Bankruptcy Court determined that the Order \ncould properly be the subject of a stay because the practical effect of such decision was that \"it will \ninform the Court's consideration of the motion to approve the DIP loan.\" (Initial Stay Decision 4-5 \n(citing United States v. Safehouse , 468 F. Supp. 3d 687 (E.D. Pa. 2020) (declaratory judgment is \nproperly the subject of a stay where it will have an obvious practical effect)). \n7 concluded that the Appellants ' likelihood of success was more than negligible without concluding \nthat it is likely or probable. (Id. at 5). In reaching this conclusion , the Bankruptc y Court re\u00ad\nemphasized that the hierarchy of consents set forth in Section 9.02 of the 10.5% Notes Indenture \nmade it illogical to read section 9.02(d)(10) as an anti-subordination provision. (Id. at 6). Such a \nreading, in the Bankruptcy Court's own words, is \"readily apparent. \" (Id. at 7). The Bankruptc y \nCourt further noted that Appellants ' arguments , rather than move the needle in their favor, \n\"demonstrate why they are unlikely to prevail on the merits.\" In the Bankruptcy Court's view, \nAppellants ' reading would render Section 9.02(e) superfluous and meaningless because \nsubordination equally affects all 10.5% Noteholders. (Id. at 7-8). The Bankruptc y Court further \nexplained that the reference to \"custom and usage\" in the Order, and any related observations , were \nintended to simply concern the context in which to review the agreements at issue, and regardless , \n\"has no effect on [the Bankruptcy] Court's bottom-line conclusion. \" (Id. at 9-12). \nWith respect to irreparable harm, the Bankruptc y Court held that, because it planned to \nproceed with a hearing on the final approval of the DIP Facility on the premise that its Order was \ncorrect, Appellants had a substantial case for irreparable injury. At the same time, the Bankruptcy \nCourt acknowledged , \"It is not certain that the [DIP Facility] loan will be approved ,\" and that \"there \nare potential bases for objecting to the [DIP Facility] loan that do not depend on the declaratory \njudgment ruling.\" (Id. at 12). \nThe Bankruptcy Court concluded that the balancing of equities weighed heavily against a \nstay. Should the DIP Motion not be determined as scheduled , the Bankruptcy Court noted, the \nresulting harm to the Debtors' bankruptc y estates would greatly outweigh the harm alleged by \nAppellants. Although Appellants face a potential reduction in their recoveries on their \napproximately $90 million of funded debt, the Bankruptcy Court recognized that such potential \nharm \"is swamped by the potential harm on the other side of the ledger.\" (Id. at 16). Noting that \n8 the DIP loan would only be approved if the Debtors succeed in demonstrating that the loan \"is \nnecessary to preserve the assets of the estate,\" in such a circumstance, prohibiting entry of the loan \n\"will lead to the destruction of value,\" which destruction would harm the company's nearly 500 \nemployees, creditors holding over $1 billion of funded debt, and the various tort plaintiffs, and \ncould also threaten the Debtors' relationships with their vendors and suppliers. (Id. at 16-17). The \nBankruptc y Court found that the potential harm asserted by Appellants , and their low likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, was \"thoroughly overwhelmed\" by the harm that the Debtors and their \nconstituents would suffer if the stay were granted and the Debtors were prevented from obtaining \nfinal approval of the DIP Financing, and denied the stay on such basis. (Id.) \nF. The Emergency Motions and Temporary Stay \nOn July 13, 2022, Appellants filed the Emergency Stay Motion with this Court along with \nthe Motion to Expedite. In light of the impending hearing to approve the DIP loan on a final basis \n(\"DIP Hearing\"), which was then scheduled for July 15, 2022, this Court ordered a temporary stay \nthrough and including July 25, 2022, and ordered expedited briefing of the Emergency Motions. \nThe hearing on the DIP Motion did not proceed on July 15, 2022. Based on instruction from the \nBankruptcy Court, the parties have held July 29, 2022 as a tentative date for the rescheduled DIP \nHearing. \nII. JURISDICTION \nThe Court has jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments, orders, and decrees of the \nbankruptcy court. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(l). No issue remains to be decided in the adversary \nproceeding, and the Order and Judgment are final. \nIII. ST AND ARD OF REVIEW \nThis Court \"review[s] the bankruptcy court's legal determinations de nova, its factual \nfindings for clear error and its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof.\" See In re Trans World \n9 Airlines, Inc., 145 F.3d 124, 131 (3d Cir. 1998). The parties agree (D.I. 1 ,r 33; D.I. 10 ,r 51) that \nthis appeal presents matters of pure contractual interpretation, which this Court reviews de nova. \nSee Viera v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 642 F.3d 407,413 (3d Cir. 2011). \nIV. ANALYSIS \nA. Emergency Stay Motion \n\"The granting of a motion for stay pending appeal is discretionary with the court.\" In re \nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 2001 WL 1820325, at *2-3 (Bankr. D. Del. Mar. 27, 2001). Appellants \nbear the burden of showing that a stay of the Order is warranted based on the following criteria: (1) \nwhether the movant has made \"a strong showing\" that it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) \nwhether the movant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether a stay will substantially \ninjure other interested parties; and ( 4) where the public interest lies. Republic of Philippines v. \nWestinghouse Electric Corp., 949 F.2d 653, 658 (3d Cir. 1991). The most critical factors, \naccording to the Supreme Court, are the first two: whether the stay movant has demonstrated (1) a \nstrong showing of the likelihood of success, and (2) that it will suffer irreparable harm -the latter \nreferring to harm that cannot be prevented or fully rectified by a successful appeal. In re Revel AC, \nInc., 802 F.3d 558,568 (3d Cir. 2015) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418,434 (2009)). The \nCourt's analysis should proceed as follows: \nDid the applicant make a sufficient showing that (a) it can win on the merits \n(significantly better than negligible but not greater than 50%) and (b) [it] will suffer \nirreparable harm absent a stay? If it has, we balance the relative harms considering \nall four factors using a 'sliding scale' approach. However , if the movant does not \nmake the requisite showings on either of these first two factors, the inquiry into the \nbalance of harms and the public interest is unnecessary, and the stay should be \ndenied without further analysis. \nIn re Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 571 (emphasis in text) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n10 1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nAs to the first factor-whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that it is likely \nto succeed on the merits-a sufficient degree of success for a strong showing exists if there is \"a \nreasonable chance, or probability , of winning.\" In re Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 568-69 (quoting Singer \nMgmt. Consultant s, Inc. v. Milgram, 650 F.3d 223,229 (3d Cir. 2011) (en bane)). It \"is not enough \nthat the chance of success on the merits be better than negligible ,\" but the likelihood of winning on \nappeal need not be \"more likely than not.\" Id. at 569 (internal quotations omitted). The question \nthe Third Circuit asked in Revel was, \"Did the applicant make a sufficient showing that ... it can \nwin on the merits\" by a showing \"significantl y better than negligible but not necessarily greater than \n50%.\" In re Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 571. \nThe central issue on appeal is whether the adoption of the Supplemental Indenture or the \n2021 Intercreditor Agreement violates Section 9.02(d)(10) of the 10.5% Notes Indenture , which \nprovides that \"an amendment , supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect \nto any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder) ... make any change in the provisions of the \nIntercreditor Agreement or this Indenture dealing with the application of proceeds of Collateral \nthat would adversely affect the Holders.\" (10.5% Notes Indenture\u00a7 9.02(d)(10)). The parties \ndispute how broadly or narrowly to read the term \"dealing with the application of proceeds of \nCollateral. \" Appellants read the language broadly, arguing that any change that would put new debt \nahead of them with respect to the right to recover out of the Collateral \"deal[s] with the application \nof proceeds of Collateral. \" (D .I. 1 at 14 (\"That broad language covers any amendments that would \nalter the order in which Collateral proceeds are to be distributed-whether among the Senior \nNoteholders , between the Senior Noteholders and the ABL Lenders, or between those classes and \nthe new [10.875%] Noteholders. \")). Appellants thus argue that the amendments to the 10.5% Notes \n11 Indenture made by the Supplemental Indenture (including subjecting the 10.5% Notes Indenture to \nthe 2021 Intercreditor Agreement) were covered by Section 9.02(d)(10) and required their consent. \nAppellees counter that those changes did not \"deal with\" application of proceeds of \nCollateral. According to Appellees, the only provision of the 10.5% Notes Indenture that \"deals \nwith the application of proceeds of collateral \" is Section 6.10, which addresses the waterfall for how \nthe trustee should distribute monies it receives under the indenture (including the distribution of \nproceeds of collateral). That provision states that, after the payment of the trustee's fees, such funds \nare to be distributed \"ratably\" among holders. (10.5% Notes Indenture\u00a7 6.l0(a)). Thus, if the \nagreement were amended so that certain holders would be paid ahead of others out of the proceeds \nof collateral, such an amendment could not be effective under Section 9. 02( d)( 10), as against an \nadversely affected objecting holder. On the other hand, so long as the proceeds of collateral that \ncomes into the hands of the trustee are to be distributed ratably among the noteholder-as remained \nthe case after the adoption of the Supplemental Indenture-then the indenture has not been \namended in any way that \"deal[s] with the application of the proceeds of Collateral. \" (10.5% Notes \nIndenture\u00a7 9.02(d)(l0)) . \nLooking at the words in isolation, the Bankruptcy Court observed , \"reasonable arguments \ncould be made on either side.\" (Mem. Op. 22). But based on the \"context ... provided by the other \nterms of the 2019 [10.5% Notes] Indenture itself,\" the Bankruptcy Court adopted Appellees ' \nnarrower reading. The Bankruptcy Court focused on an \"anomaly\" that would result under \nAppellants ' proposed reading, which would allow for the release of all or substantially all of the \nunderlying collateral with only 2/3 of noteholders' support (as Section 9.02(e) of the 10.5% Notes \nIndenture does) but require unanimous approval for subordination. The Bankruptcy Court \nultimately concluded: \"In sum, contrary to the argument advanced by the objecting noteholders , ... \n[Section] 9.02(d)(10) of the 10.5% Notes Indenture is primarily directed at protecting the holders' \n12 rights to ratable treatment and should not be read as an anti-subordination provision in disguise.\" \n(Id. at 27-28). \nIn my view, Appellants have not demonstrated a significantly better than negligible chance \nthat they can prevail on the merits of their appeal. First, I find no support for Appellants ' argument \nin the text of the agreements . By its unambiguous terms, Section 9.02(d)(10 ) encompasses \namendments \"dealing with the application of proceeds of Collateral. \" I agree that the only \nprovision of the 10.5% Notes Indenture that \"deal[s] with the application of proceeds of Collateral \" \nis Section 6.10, which addresses the waterfall for how the trustee should distribute monies it \nreceives under the indenture (including the distribution of proceeds of collateral ). The only \nprovisions in the 10.5% Notes Indenture and the 2019 Intercreditor Agreement \"dealing with the \napplication of proceeds of Collateral \" are (i) Section 4.l(a) of the Intercreditor Agreement (which \ndeals with the priorities between the 10.5% Noteholders (via the 10.5% Notes Trustee), on the one \nhand, and the ABL representative , on the other hand), and (ii) Section 6.10 of the 10.5% Notes \nIndenture (which deals with the \"Priorities \" among the 10.5% Noteholders themselves) . As a result, \nSection 9.02(d)(10) does not apply to priorities between the two different tranches of notes, the \n10.875% Notes and the 10.5% Notes. \nAppellants ' argument relies solely on\u00a7 9.02(d)(10). Appellants argue for \"a commonsense \nreading\" of that section: that \"dealing with the application of Collateral proceeds \" covers more than \njust amendments affecting the ratable distribution of such proceeds within a single class of \nnoteholders; rather, \"[a]pplication of proceeds covers the order and manner in which proceeds of \nCollateral are paid out;\" \"subordination is, by its very definition , a matter of application of \nproceeds;\" and because the 2021 transaction changed the order in which proceeds are paid, \nAppellants ' consent was required. (D.I. 25 at 2, 5, 15). \n13 I find little support for Appellants ' interpretation of Section 9.02(d)(10) as an anti\u00ad\nsubordination provision. No such words exist in the plain language of that section. Section 9.02(e), \nwhich immediately follows that section, permits, with the consent of a supermajority of the 10.5% \nNoteholders , an amendment to, or waiver of, provisions of the 10.5% Notes Indenture that modifies \nthe 2019 Intercreditor Agreement \"in any manner adverse in any material respect to the Holders.\" \n(10.5% Notes Indenture\u00a7 9.02(e) (emphasis added)). As a result, any transaction that had the effect \nof amending the 2019 Intercreditor Agreement would be permissible so long as a supermajority of \nholders consented to such transaction , and it is undisputed that a supermajority of 10.5% \nNoteholders consented to the 2021 transaction. \nIn support of their reading of 9.02(d)(10) as an anti-subordination provision , Appellants rely \n(D.I. 1 at ,r,r 38-50) uponAudax Credit Opportunities Offshore v. TMK Hawk Parent, 150 N.Y.S.3d \n894 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty. Aug. 19, 2021) (\"TriMark:'), a case which also involved amendments to a \nprovision concerning the \"application of proceeds. \" TriMark involved a slightly different \"uptier\" \ntransaction , whereby a majority group of noteholders jump their existing debt ahead of a minority \ngroup whose notes are left behind, thereby resulting in a full recovery to the majority. (See Mem. \nOp. at 2 (noting that the 2021 transaction-in which the majority 10.5% noteholders continued to \nown all 10.5% notes even after the 10.875% notes were issued-\"is somewhat less aggressive than \nthe paradigmatic 'uptier' transaction \"). The transaction in TriMark was challenged by the \nnoteholders who were \"left behind\" on the basis that the amendments to the agreement to authorize \nthat transaction required their consent pursuant to a clause providing that an amendment could not \nrevise Section 4.02 of the collateral agreement \"in a manner that would by its terms alter the \napplication of proceeds\" without \"the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected \nthereby.\" Id. at *11. Section 4.02 set up a waterfall among three separate constituents in the credit \nagreement. The TriMark court observed that one \"reasonable way\" to read the provision is as a \n14 prohibition on subordination -to prohibit the parties \"from placing any tranche of debt above \nPlaintiffs ' place in the waterfall , even if the order of distribution \" is not affected. Id. at *12. Under \nthis reading, even if the objectors ' rights were not affected vis-a-vis the other holders in their same \ntranche, the objectors still \"have a plausible argument that the [transaction] required their consent \n... because it altered the application of proceeds by subordinating Plaintiffs ' priority interest to the \nnew Super-Priority Intercreditor Agreement. \" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The TriMark \ncourt noted the counter-argument by defendants that \"application of proceeds\" refers \"only to the \nAdministrative Agent's application of proceeds among the categories covered by the agreement. \" \nId. Under this view, \"the Administrative Agent's task remains the same before and after the \namendment-it still applies the 'proceeds ' (whatever is left of them) in the order specified \" in the \nagreement. Id. \n\"Even assuming the Defendants ' interpretation is plausible ,\" the TriMark court noted, \"it is \nnot the only reasonable way to read the contract.\" Id. Because the TriMark court found that the \nobjectors ' reading to be a plausible one, it denied a motion to dismiss the complaint and allowed the \nlitigation to proceed. Id. The case settled thereafter. Thus, TriMark did not resolve the question as \nto whether the prohibition on subordination was a \"sacred right\" in the context of the agreement at \nissue there. (Mem. Op. at 24). The TriMark court never reached a definitive construction of the \nlanguage at issue and TriMark does not create a likelihood of success on the merits. \nThe Bankruptcy Court cited Serta, a case in which the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York declined the invitation to construe a similar sacred rights provision as an anti\u00ad\nsubordination clause. See LCM XXII Ltd. v. Serta Simmons Bedding, LLC, 2022 WL 953109 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2022). In that case, the sacred rights provision at issue required \"consent from \nall affected Lenders for any waiver, amendment, or modification of the provisions of section 2.18(b) \nor (c) ... in a manner that would by its terms alter the pro rata sharing of payments required \n15 thereby. Serta, 2022 WL 953109, at *2 ( emphasis added). Like the Bankruptcy Court here, the \nSerta court declined the invitation to read this provision as an anti-subordination provision in \ndisguise: \nWhile the Amendments had the effect of extinguishing certain first-lien lenders' \nloans in exchange for an elevation of their priority rights under a new class of debt, \nthe Amendments left untouched the pro rata rights of first-lien lenders vis-a-vis other \nfirst-lien lenders. At base, Plaintiffs ' objection to the Transaction is not the \ninterruption of their pro rata payment rights within the same class of lenders -\nwhich remain fully intact -but rather the subordination of their first-lien loans. \nDespite Plaintiffs ' protestations , anti-subordination is not a sacred right protected by \nSection 9.02(b)(A)(6) , or any other provision of Section 9.02. Thus, the Agreement \npermitted such changes to be made with the consent of only a majority of lenders. \nId. at * 10. The Bankruptcy Court cited Sert a in support of its proposition that \"a provision \nproviding for ratable distribution (in the absence of an express anti-subordination clause) would \nmore naturally apply to distributions within a class, and not prohibit subordination of an entire class \nto another, different class.\" (Mem. Op. 25 n.75). \nAppellants argue that Serta does not apply here because the sacred rights provision in Serta \nprotects \"only 'pro rata' rights\" and therefore \"concerns only rights within [a] class of \nshareholders. \" (D.I. 1 at 13-14). According to Appellants , the use of\"application of proceeds of \nCollateral\" in the 10.5% Notes Indenture \"refers to the complete waterfall by which proceeds are \napplied,\" and \"not merely a single step of that waterfall that requires pro rata sharing, which is a \ndistinct concept.\" (Id. at 13) (emphasis in original). According to Appellants , the only authority \ninterpreting the broader \"application of proceeds\" phrase in this context is TriMark, which supports \ntheir interpretation. (Id. at 5-6). As discussed, TriMark did not reach a definitive construction of \nthe language at issue. Appellants are correct that Serta considered different language , but Serta \nsupports the Bankruptcy Court's interpretation insomuch as it also rejected a broad interpretation of \nthe sacred rights provision as an anti-subordination provision and limited the unanimous consent \n16 requirement to only those sacred rights specifically \"enumerated. \" See Sert a, 2022 WL 953109 at \n*9-10. \nAppellants also dispute the Bankruptcy Court's hierarchy of consent analysis. While noting \nthat both constructions of the language at issue in TriMark \"were plausible based on the language in \nisolation,\" the Bankruptcy Court concluded that the language at issue here, read in the context of \n\"the other terms of the 2019 [10.5% Notes] Indenture itself,\" compelled a narrower reading of \nSection 9.02(d)(10). (Mem. Op. 25-26). Indeed, the 10.5% Notes Indenture created a hierarchy of \nconsents needed for particular amendments-it generally provided for control by the majority; \nstated that a super-majority of two-thirds was required to release all or substantially all of the \ncollateral ; and then identified ten \"sacred rights\" that required unanimous consent of affected \nholders. The Bankruptcy Court observed that the logic of this hierarchy suggests that the matters \nincluded among the ten \"sacred rights\" would be actions that are-at least from the perspective of \nan individual holder-more problematic or prejudicial than the kinds of actions that can be taken \nsimply with the approval of a simple or two-thirds majority. It would create an anomaly to read the \n10.5% Notes Indenture to permit a two-thirds majority to take a more drastic action ofreleasing all \ncollateral but give every holder the right to block the less extreme measure of subordination . \nReading \u00a7 9. 02( d)( 10) to be limited to protecting the right to pro rat a distributions is consistent with \nthis structure, the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, as an individual holder would be severely prejudiced \nif the other holders all agreed that they would be paid in full out of the distribution of the proceeds \nof collateral before that individual holder received any distribution . Reading\u00a7 9.02(d)(10) to treat \nany subordination as violating a \"sacred right,\" on the other hand, would be inconsistent with this \nhierarchy , the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, because subordination of a lien to that of another lender \nis a less drastic intrusion on the rights of an individual holder than simply releasing all of the \ncollateral. \"There are many reasons why a lender might agree to subordinate its lien to one in favor \n17 of a new lender.\" (Mem. Op. at 26-27). \"In circumstances in which a borrower is facing a liquidity \nconstraint , an old lender that is unwilling or unable to make a further loan might be very happy to \nsubordinate its lien if that is the most cost-effective way for the borrower to attract new capital and \nthus avoid the greater threat to the lender's collateral that a default would precipitate. \" (Id.) \nAppellants argue on appeal that the Bankruptcy Court erred in applying this hierarchy as \n\"neither the contract nor any caselaw provides that actions implicating sacred rights, and requiring \nconsent of all adversely affected Holders, must be more \"drastic\" than those which can be \nundertaken by a supermajority. \" (D.I. 25 at 9). The touchstone of contract interpretation is the text \nof the contract, Appellants argue, and not a court's opinion of how the text could be made more \nsensible (Id. (citing Greenfield v. Philles Records, 98 N.Y.2d 562, 569 (2002)). But the \nBankruptcy Court's reading of the 10.5% Notes Indenture is a reasonable one harmonizing\u00a7 \n9.02(d)(l) with\u00a7 9.02(e). As the Bankruptcy Court observed , under any reading of\u00a7 9.02(d)(l0) \nthat was broad enough to cover subordination , it would also cover the release of collateral. Because \n\u00a7 9.02(e) requires only a two-thirds majority to release all of the collateral , any reading of\u00a7 \n9.02(d)(10) that would require the consent of every holder for the release of collateral would \nconflict with \u00a7 9 .02( e ). \"The import of this construction is that \u00a7 9 .02( d)(l 0) needs to be read more \nnarrowly than the objecting noteholders contend.\" (Initial Stay Decision at 6). It is logical for\u00a7 \n9.02(d)(10) , which would require unanimous consent, to apply to an amendment that would be more \ndrastic or prejudicial to an individual noteholder than the release of collateral. Reading \u00a7 \n9.02(d)(10) as treating the right to ratable treatment as a \"sacred right\" that cannot be amended \naway without the consent of each affected holder is consistent with the language and more \nconsonant with the overall structure and hierarchy of consents reflected in the indenture . The \nstrained hypothetical posed by Appellants (D.I. 1 at 20) does not give rise to a likelihood of success. \n18 Finally, the Bankruptcy Court acknowledged that the question before the Bankruptc y Court \nwas \"a pure question of contractual interpretation that can be resolved on the undisputed factual \nrecord before the Court.\" (Mem. Op. at 15). According to Appellants , the Bankruptcy Court \ntherefore committed reversible error because it looked to \"the customs, practices, usages and \nterminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business\" to interpret the Section \n9.02(d)(10), rather than relying on the plain text of the indenture. (D.I. 1 at 147 (citing Mem. Op. \nat 24-25)). The Memorandum Opinion noted that a provision providing for ratable distribution (in \nthe absence of an express anti-subordination clause) would more naturally apply to distributions \nwithin a class, and not prohibit subordination of an entire class to another, different class-indeed , \nwhen the parties adopted the Supplemental Indenture , they included such a standard anti\u00ad\nsubordination clause. (Supplemental Indenture \u00a7 9.02(f) (\"Notwithstanding the foregoing in this \nSection 9.02, no amendment, supplement or waiver to the Indenture or any other Note Document \nshall subordinate the Lien securing the Notes Obligations to any other Lien (and the Trustee shall \nnot enter into any intercreditor agreement providing for such subordination) without the consent of \nthe holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. \")) \nBut the Bankruptcy Court clarified in its Initial Stay Decision the point it had intended to \nmake: that in construing the language of a contract \"even without extrinsic evidence of custom and \nusage, the context and subject of the agreement can help lend clarity to terms that might otherwise \nbe ambiguous. \" (Initial Stay Decision at 9-10). In the context of a leveraged loan agreement , the \ncourt noted, \"one would not expect parties who intend to prohibit subordination to do so by \namendments that deal with the allocation of the proceeds of collateral. \" (Id. at 10). The court \nfurther clarified that the principal basis for granting summary judgment in favor of the Appellees \n(and denying Appellants' summary judgment motion) was \"the structural one about 'hierarchy of \nconsents' contained in the indenture'\"-a fundamental concern which had nothing to do with \n19 custom and usage. (Id. at 11-12). Indeed, while referencing the customs and practices in the \ncontext of an indenture , the Memorandum Opinion itself makes clear that the \"[ e ]ven more telling \ncontext\" is that \"provided by the other terms of the 2019 [10.5% Notes] Indenture itself.\" (Mem. \nOp. 24-25). Based on the foregoing, I agree that the inclusion of the language about \"customs, \npractices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business \" does \nnot give rise to a substantial likelihood that Appellants will prevail on the merits of their appeal. \nI find that Appellants have not made a significantly better than negligible showing that they \nare likely to succeed on the merits of the appeal. \n2. Irreparable Harm Absent a Stay \nThe applicant for a stay must \"demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence\" of \nthe stay. Winters v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). Irreparable \nharm is an injury that \"cannot be redressed by a legal or equitable remedy following a trial.\" \nNovartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharms. Co., 290 F.3d \n578, 595 (3d Cir. 2002). \nAppellants assert \"three independent irreparable harms.\" (D.I. 1 at ,r 60). First, without a \nstay pending appeal, Appellants will lose access to the proceeds of Collateral without adequate \nprotection or a valid waiver, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. (Id) Second, proceeding to the \nDIP Hearing with the Order intact and issuing relief unfavorable to Appellants pending appeal \nwould irreparably harm their property right in the 10.5% Notes by diluting their security interest. \n(Id. ,r 70). Third, absent a stay, Appellees may later argue that Appellants' appeal has become \nstatutorily moot under\u00a7 364(e) of the Bankruptcy Code or equitably moot under the Third Circuit's \nstandard. \nAppellees argue that Appellants have failed to demonstrate that any harm would be actual \nand imminent. I disagree. In absence of stay, the eventual DIP Hearing will proceed on the premise \n20 that the Order's declaratory judgment ruling is correct. As the Bankruptcy Court noted, it is not \ncertain that the DIP loan will be approved , as there are potential bases for objecting to the DIP loan \nthat do not depend on the declaratory judgment ruling in the Order. But I agree with the \nBankruptcy Court that, as a practical matter, the resolution of the declaratory judgment ruling \nincreased the risk the objecting noteholders face that the DIP loan may be approved and that the \n10.5% Notes will thus be placed behind the subsequent loans in priority. \nAppellees further argue that Appellants have failed to establish that any harm would be \nirreparable. Appellees argue that a purely economic injury, compensable in money, cannot satisfy \nthe irreparable injury requirement unless the potential economic loss is so great as to threaten the \nexistence of the movant's business-an assertion Appellants have not made. See Revel AC, 802 \nF.3d at 572. Again, I disagree with Appellees. \nLike the Bankruptcy Court, this Court does not read the Third Circuit case law to apply \nequitable mootness outside of the context of a confirmed plan. Statutory mootness , however, \npresents a very real challenge . If the DIP loan is approved, and Appellants are successful on appeal, \nthey would face a statutory challenge under\u00a7 364(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that \nthe \"reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization under this section to obtain credit or \nincur debt, or of a grant under this section of a priority or a lien, does not affect the validity of any \ndebt so incurred, or any priority or lien so granted, to an entity that extended such credit in good \nfaith, whether or not such entity knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless such authorization and \nthe incurring of such debt, or the granting of such priority or lien, were stayed pending appeal.\" 11 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 364(e). Thus, it does not appear that the subsequent reversal of the Order on appeal would \nprovide a basis to restore the prior scheme of priority. According to Appellees, Appellants ' remedy, \nif they are right and the rollup cannot be unwound , would be money damages. (D.I. 10 at 34-35). \nThe Court agrees it would be extremely difficult to fashion a remedy if the DIP loan is approved \n21 and Appellants are later successful on appeal. Based on the foregoing , Appellants have carried their \nburden of establishing irreparable harm. \n3. Balancing of Harms \nDespite finding that Appellants have carried their burden of demonstrating irreparable harm, \nhaving already determined that Appellants have failed to carry their burden as to likelihood of \nsuccess, I am satisfied no further analysis is required and the stay should be denied. See Revel AC, \n802 F.3d at 571. I nevertheless address the remainder of the analysis, however, as I have thought \nabout it and it may assist the Court of Appeals should there be a further appeal. In balancing the \nharms, the Court should \"weigh the likely harm to the movant (absent a stay) (factor two) against \nthe likely irreparable harm to the stay opponent(s) if the stay is granted (factor three). The Court \nshould also take into account where the public interest lies (factor four)-in effect, how a stay \ndecision has consequences beyond the immediate parties.\" In re Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 569 \n(internal quotation and citation omitted). \nAs the Bankruptcy Court noted, the objecting noteholders have a stake of approximately 10 \npercent in a $930 million debt issuance. The potential injury Appellants face is thus a reduction in \ntheir percentage recovery on that debt. \nOn the other hand, Appellees have provided substantial evidence of harms the Debtors \nwould face from loss or delay of the DIP loan. In order to obtain approval of the DIP loan, Debtors \nwill be required to make a showing that borrowing money \"is necessary to preserve the assets of the \nestate.\" Thus, in any circumstance in which the DIP loan would otherwise be approved, loss or \ndelay of the DIP loan will lead to the destruction of value affecting the Debtors' five hundred \nemployees, other creditors holding more than $1 billion in other funded debt, as well as the tort \nclaimants who suffered injury when the Debtors' facility in Port Neches, Texas exploded in \nNovember 2019. \n22 The Debtors operate in a volatile business, one impacted by shifts in commodity prices and \nother factors beyond the Debtors' control, including weather and natural disasters. (D .I. 10-1 (\"Del \nGenie Dec.\") ,i,i 17-25). This is particularly true because the Debtors operate a cash-intensive \nbusiness with accounts payable and accounts receivables that can vary widely. Appellees submit \nevidence supporting the potential harm that a further delay of the DIP Hearing may impose, \nincluding that: (i) Debtors currently have over $43,000,000 in vendor and supplier bills from May \nthat are due in July (see id. ,i,i 8-9); (ii) with the rise in commodity prices, vendor and supplier \nexpenses have risen to between $100,000 ,000 and $150,000,000 per month (id. at ,i 20); (iii) the \ninherent risks that come with the Debtors' business, which can cause large variances in liquidity \nneeds, making the historical minimum liquidity threshold a less than perfect indicator of the \nDebtors' future liquidity needs (id. at ,i 18-22); (iv) failure to obtain the Final DIP Order would \nresult in a substantial erosion of the liquidity the Debtors currently enjoy from the interim DIP loan \nand ABL facility (id. at ,i 6-16); and (v) the failure to obtain the Term DIP Facility on a final basis \nwould result in a default of the interim DIP Loan, thereby obligating Debtors, under the terms of \nthose agreements , to repay the current draw of $32,000,000, further eroding the Debtors' liquidity \nby that amount (id. at ,i 10-12). \nAdditionally , Debtors have provided the declaration of Zul Jamal that, based on his \nconversations with Eclipse, the ABL DIP Lender, that the failure of Debtors to obtain entry of a \nfinal order on the DIP loan by end of day July 18, 2022 would result in an event of default under \nSection 7.0l(k)(iii)(c) of the Term DIP Facility and ABL DIP Facility. (D.I. 10-2 (\"Jamal Dec.\") i! \n13). Appellants argue that the Court's current stay of the Order and Judgment until July 25, 2022 \nhas already triggered an event of default under the ABL DIP Facility yet, \"There is no evidence that \nthe ABL DIP lender has stopped providing financing to TPC or has indicated that it will stop doing \nso.\" (D.I. 25 at 17). But Appellants do not dispute that Eclipse's willingness to provide the ABL \n23 DIP Loan Facility-which no party disputes is necessary-on the existing negotiated terms is \ncontingent upon approval of the Term DIP Loan Facility on a final basis. (Jamal Dec. ,r,r 14-15; see \nalso 6/2/22 Tr. at 180:16-181 :22 (Mr. Jamal testifying that, for Eclipse, \"[t]he entire basis for their \nunderwrite was that the expectation that there would be new money coming in in the form of the \n[DIP] term loan\"). If that does not occur, there is no guarantee that Eclipse will continue to provide \nthe ABL DIP Loan Facility (or on what terms). Thus, if the Debtors lose access to the Term DIP \nFacility due to delays caused by the stay, the ABL DIP Loan Facility will also be in jeopardy, \neroding the Debtors' available liquidity and forcing the repayment of amounts borrowed thereunder . \n(Jamal Dec. ,r,r 14-15). \nAppellants dispute Debtors' view that even a further short delay of the DIP Hearing, to \nallow the expedited briefing and ruling on the appeal sought by the Appellants , could cause the \nDebtors to lose over $140,000,000 in liquidity. (Del Genio Dec. ,r,r 6-16). Along with the over \n$43,000,000 owed to vendors and suppliers for May orders, this would leave the Debtors \nsubstantially short of the bare minimum $50,000,000 in liquidity to operate its business. (Id. ,r 8-9, \n16). Such an occurrence would damage relationships with the Debtors' key business partners, the \nDebtors' workforce , and commercial counterparties by disrupting the Debtors' ordinary-course \noperations and causing them to fail to meet their financial commitments. (Id. ,r,r 28-30). It would \npresent substantial , if not insurmountable, challenges in holding vendor and supplier relationships\u00ad\nparties that provide better terms and credit when the Debtors can show substantial liquidity exists. \n(Id.) \nAppellants ' assertion that the Debtors have alternative postpetition financing available \ndiscounts the Debtors' business judgment in concluding that the Term DIP Facility is the best and \nonly actionable postpetition financing proposal available to the Debtors. (Jamal Dec. ,r 14-16). The \nDIP Facility was negotiated at arms' length and does not require nonconsensual priming of existing \n24 prepetition liens. (Id.) As the Debtors are unable to provide adequate protection to the 10.5% \nNotes collateral agent on account ofnonconsensual priming, and the 10.5% Notes collateral agent \nhas not consented to priming by liens other than those securing the Term DIP Facility, Appellants' \nassertions regarding an \"alternative proposal\" are belied by the facts. (Id.; see also 6/2/22 Hearing \nTr. at 194:17-23). \nMoreover , as Mr. Jamal has testified without dispute, the Term DIP Facility and the \nrestructuring support agreement provide the Debtors with new money on reasonable terms under the \ncircumstances and provide a path to emergence from these chapter 11 cases. (Id). The Debtors \ndetermined in their business judgment that the RSA transactions constitute the best and only \nrestructuring transactions available to the Debtors and maximize value for the benefit of all parties \nin these chapter 11 cases. (Id.) Appellants' requested relief would put the Debtors into default \nunder their DIP facilities and allow the RSA to be terminated without providing any alternative \nviable path forward for the Debtors. (Id. ,r,r 11-13). \nDebtors argue that each month of delay resulting from the requested stay will dramatically \ndrain the Debtors' estate. (Del Genia Dec. ,r,r 26-27). In professionals' fees alone, the Debtors \nexpect to spend between $8 million to $10 million monthly. (Id). This forecast-which assumes \nprofessional fees of $9.3 million and $7.3 million for June and July, respectively-was \nconceptualized on proceeding consensually through the bankruptcy and does not contemplate the \nlevel oflitigation currently occurring. (Id.) Extending this process for months to resolve the appeal \nwould drain estate resources. (Id.) \nI agree with the Bankruptcy Court that these potential harms far outweigh the potential \nreduction in Appellants ' percentage recovery . \n25 4. Where the Public Interest Lies \nThe Court agrees with the Bankruptc y Court that, in the context of this dispute, which is \nprimarily a commercial dispute between private parties, consideration of the public interest does not \nadd materially to the considerations described above. \nBecause the balance of equities weighs strongly against the entry of a stay, the Emergenc y \nStay Motion will be denied. \nB. Emergency Motion to Expedite \nAppellants request that the Court consider this appeal on an expedited basis within a matter \nof weeks. Indeed this is \"extraordinary relief under any measure.\" In re Mallinckrodt PLC, 2021 \nWL 3403799, at *2 (D. Del. Aug. 4, 2021). For an appeal to be considered on an emergenc y, \nexpedited basis, the Appellants must (i) show justification for \"considering the appeal ahead of \nother matters,\" and (ii) demonstrate immediate or irreparable harm that would occur in the absence \nof expediting the appeal. See In re John Varvatos Enterprises , Inc., 2020 WL 3971723 , at *2 (D. \nDel. July 14, 2020) (citing to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8013(a)(2)(B) & 8013(d)(l)) . \nThat standard is not met here. The breach alleged by Appellants occurred when the Debtors \nissued the 10.875% Senior Secured Notes in February 2021. In July 2021, Appellants began \npurchasing 10.5% Notes, and over the ensuing months, Appellants built a small position in the \n10.5% Notes. Appellants did not seek judicial relief until the Chapter 11 cases were filed in June of \nthis year, leading to this emergency. As the timeline demonstrates , any exigencies are of \nAppellants ' own making in failing to seek relief before the bankruptcy filing. \"Such extraordinary \nrelief [ of expediting an appeal] should not be granted to redress a purported emergency that was \ncaused by Appellants ' own delay and failure to follow established procedures. \" In re Mallinckrodt \nPLC, 2021 WL 3403799, at *3 (citing Bos.
