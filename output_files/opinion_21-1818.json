Counsel for Defendant.   \n         \n                \n     June 27, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware1 \nNOREIKA, U.S.  DISTRICT JUDGE : \n  \nPlaintiff  Alice T. Swiderski  (Plaintiff\u201d ), who appears pro se , filed this  employment \ndiscrimination  case on December 27, 2021.  (D.I. 1).  Pending are Defendant\u2019s motion to \ndismiss  and motion to strike  (D.I. 4, 9) and  Plaintiff\u2019s motion for default judgmen t and motion for \na review of standard of professional conduct and request for disciplinary proceeding (D.I. 6, 12).  \nThe matters have been briefed.  \nI.   BACKGROUND \n Plaintiff was employed by Defendant Samuel J. Frabizzio , Attorney at Law  (\u201cDefendant\u201d) .  \n(D.I. 1 at 2).  Her employment was terminated on  May 4, 2021.  ( Id.).  On the complaint form, \nPlaintiff check -marked discrimination due to age and disability  (Id. at 3)  while  the civil cover sheet \nindicates that Plaintiff brings this action under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42  U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, et seq . (\u201cADA\u201d) (D.I.  1-4).  The Complaint states that Plaintiff \nfiled charges with the Office of Anti -Discrimination and the EEOC on June 25, 2021 and the \nEEOC issued a right -to-sue letter received by Plaintiff on September 29, 2021.  (Id. at 2).  \nAttached to the Complaint is a right to sue notice issued by the State of Delaware Department of Labor Division of Industrial Affairs \u2013 Office of Anti -Discrimination.   (D.I. 1 -1).  The Court was \nnot provide with a notice of suit rights issue d by the EEOC.  Plaintiff seeks compensatory \ndamages.  ( Id. at 3).  \n Defendant  moves for dismissal pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2),  and 12(b)(5) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficiency of service of \nprocess, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and on the grounds that the A DA is not applicable \nto Defendant.  Defendant also moves for a more definite statement pursuant to Rule 12(e) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure .  Plaintiff opposes.   2 II. SERVICE OF PROCESS  \n Defendant moves for dismissal on the grounds that this Cour t lacks juris diction over \nDefendant based upon insufficient service of process.  Under Rule 12(b)(5)  of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure , a party may move to dismiss for insufficient service of process.  The burden \nis on the party serving process to show that service was valid.  Grand Ent. Grp. Ltd. v. Star Media \nSales, Inc ., 988 F.2d 476, 488 (3d Cir. 1993).  Service of process is governe d by Rule 4 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure .  An individual effects proper service by: (1)  following state \nlaw for serving a summons in the state where the district court is located or where service is made; \n(2) personal service; (3) leaving the summons and the complaint at the individual \u2019s \u201cusual place \nof abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there\u201d; or (4) serving process upon an agent \u201cauthorized by appointment or by law\u201d to receive service.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e).  \n Defendant\u2019s legal assistant/secretary  Maureen Donahue (\u201cDonahue\u201d)  states that a man \nentered Defendant\u2019s office on January 5, 2022, did not identify himself, and asked if Defendant was present.  (D.I. 4 -1 at 3).  Donahue asked the man if she needed to sign for a package and he \nsaid yes and that  Dona hue needed to print her name on a piece of paper.  ( Id.).  Donahue \ncomplied .  (Id.).  The man did not identify what he was dropping off.  (Id.).  Once Donahue \nprinter her name on the paper, the man kept the paper and hande d her a summons and complaint.  \n(Id.).  After the man left, Donahue handed the documents to Defendant.  Donahue is not an agent \nauthorized by appointment or by law to receive service o f process on behalf of Defendant.  \n(D.I.  4-1 at 3, 6).  Defendant was unaware the of the presence of a process service in his law \noffice until Donohue told him and af ter the process server left and.  ( Id. at 7).   \nPlaintiff argues that Donahue is the emplo yee/agent of Defendant , that working in the \nreception/lobby are her normal duties , that Donahue controls entry to the law office, and that 3 Defendant was in the office and it would have been  impossible for him to be unaware of the process \nserver\u2019s presence there.  The proof of  service signed by process server Timothy Hines states that \nhe served the summons on Donahue who is designated by law to accept service of process on \nbehalf of Defendant .  (D.I. 3).  Plaintiff does not  rebut Donahue\u2019s affidavit that the process \nserver did not identify himself or the affidavits  of Defendant and Donahue that Donahue is not \nauthorized to accept process on behalf of Defendant.  Under Rule 12(b)(5)  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court has \u201cbroad \ndiscretion\u201d in deciding whether to dismiss the complaint for insufficient service.  See \nUmbenhauer v. Woog, 969 F.2d 25, 30 (3d Cir. 1992). The Third Circuit has instructed that \u201cdismissal of a complaint is inappropriate when there exist s a reasonable prospect that service may \nyet be obtained.\u201d  Id.  Given that instruction, the Court will deny the motion to dismiss for \ninsufficient service of process.   Plaintiff will be given additional time to effect service in \ncompliance with Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nIII. OTHER GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL  \n Defendant also seeks dismissal  pursuant to Rule  12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction  for lack of a notice of right to sue rights fro m the \nEEOC and  based upon the definition of an employer under the ADA.  Rule 12(b)(1) allows the \nCourt to dismiss a case if   the Court lacks subject -matter jurisdiction over a dispute.  Rule \n12(b)(1) is not applicable here.   \n Defendant argues that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction due to Plaintiff \u2019s failure \nto complete the grievance procedure  (i.e., failure to provide a notice of right to sue letter issued by \nEEOC) , yet the Third Circuit has held that \u201c[f]ailure to exhaust  . . . \u2018do[es] not affect the District \nCourt \u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d   Anjelino v. The New York Times Co ., 200 F.3d 78, 87 4 (3d Cir. 1999) (quoting Hornsby v. United States Postal Service , 787 F.2d 87, 89 (3d Cir. 1986)).   \nAnd, while the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is not a jurisdictional defect, it does \nprovide grounds for dismissing a case under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rul e of Civil Procedure.  \nSee Anjelino v. New York Times Co ., 200 F.3d at 87-88.  Defendant, however, does not move for \ndismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  He only seeks dismissal under  Rule 12(b)(1).  The Third \nCircuit has held that it is impermissible for a district court to reach the merits of a claim through a \nRule 12(b)(1) motion, which in essence would be converting a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  See Davis v. Wells Fargo , 824 F.3d 333, 348- 49 (3d Cir. 2016). \n Defendant also moves for dismissal under Rule  12(b)(1) on the grounds that he is not an \nemployer as that term is defined under the ADA.\n1  It seems Defendant is unaware of Nesbit v. \nGears Unlimited, Inc ., 347 F.3d 72 (3d Cir.  2003) , which determined that  the fifteen employee \nthreshold is  not jurisdictional; and rather is a \u201csubstantive element (whether an \u2018employer\u2019 exists) \nof a [ADA] claim.\u201d   Id.  at 83.  The Third Circuit further determined the Rule 12(b)(1) standard \nis inapplicable and that the issue should be \u201cunder the summary judgment standard\u201d  given that \nmatters outside the pleadings are considered.  Id. at 84. \n Defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal unde r Rule 12(b)(1) will be denied.  \nIV. MISCELLANEOUS MOTIONS   \n Defendant\u2019s motion to strike will be granted.  (D.I.  9).  Plaintiff submitted documents \nthat are not relevant to the issues raised.  Plaintiff\u2019s motion for default judgment  will be denied.  \n \n1   The ADA is only applicable to employers employing the requisite number of employees.  \nIt defines an employer, in part, as \u201ca person engaged in an industry affecting commerce  \nwho has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar  weeks \nin the current or preceding calendar year.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111.  Under  the Age  \nDiscrimination in Emp loyment Act, a n employer under the law is defined as \u201ca  person \nengaged in an industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees . . . [or] \nany agent of such a person.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b).   5 (D.I. 6).  Proper service has not been effected and there has been no entry of default.  See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 55.  Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a review of standard of professional conduct and request for \ndisciplinary proceeding  will be denied.  (D.I. 12).   Such filings in this employment \ndiscrimination are inappropriate.  Rule 83.6 of the Local Rules of this Court set forth the \nappropriate mechanism for attorney discipline.   \nV.   CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the C ourt will: (1) deny without prejudice to renew  Defendant \u2019s \nmotion  to dismiss  (D.I. 4); (2) grant Defendant\u2019s motion to strike (D.I. 9) ; (3) deny Plaintiff\u2019s \nmotion for default judgment  (D.I. 6); (4) deny Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a review of standard of \nprofessional conduct and request for disciplinary proceeding (D.I.  12); and (5) give Plaintiff \nadditional time to properly serv e Defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4.   \n   An appropriate order will be entered.   \n  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nALICE T.
