's motion for summary judgment. \n(D.I. 71). The motion has been fully briefed. (D.I. 72, 85, 89). For the reasons set forth below, \nAgroFresh 's motion is denied. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Prior Litigation and Settlement \nIn 2016, AgroFresh filed a lawsuit in this Court involving Dr. Nazir Mir and Mirtech, Inc. \n(collectivel y, the \"Mir Parties\"). AgroFresh, Inc. v. MirTech, Inc., Case No. 16-662-JFB-SRF (D. \nDel.). This litigation settled. As part of the settlement , the Court approved a Final Consent \nJudgment, which incorporated a Private Settlement Agreement (D.I. 8-3, Ex. CC \u00a7 6), to resolve \nthe claims. The Final Consent Judgment recites, \nAgroFresh is hereby declared the owner of the '216 Patent, U.S. Patent No. \n8,822,382, U.S. Patent No. 8,802,140, U.S. Patent No. 9,005,657 B2, and U.S. \nPatent Publication Number 2014/0326620, along with all associated technolog y \nand related United States, foreign, and international patents and patent applications . \nThe MirTech Defendants are to execute all necessary and appropriate \ndocumentation to confirm such ownership . \n(D.I. 8-3, Ex. CC\u00a7 7(a)). \nThe Private Settlement Agreement contains an \"all necessary paperwork \" clause stating \nthat the Mir Parties \"agree to execute any and all paperwork necessary to confirm, perfect, and/or \naccomplish the assignments of any such inventions, discoveries, or improvements to AgroFresh \nwithin thirty (30) days of the Effective Date.\" (D.I. 8-1, Ex. AA \u00a7 2). The Private Settlement \nAgreement further obligates both parties \"to cooperate fully, execute any and all supplementary \ndocuments and to take all additional actions that may be necessary or appropriate to give full force \nand effect to the terms and intent of this Agreement which are not inconsistent with its terms.\" (Id \n\u00a7 20). \n2 Under the Private Settlement Agreement , the Mir Parties \"agree and warrant that the Final \nConsent Judgment is and will remain legally binding and enforceable and cannot be appealed, \ndissolved, waived, or in any way rendered unenforceable. \" (Id. \u00a7 3). \nThe Private Settlement Agreement also contains a fee-shifting provision in the event of \nlitigation. Section 15 of the Private Settlement Agreement recites: \nIn the event of any dispute, controversy , litigation , or other proceeding by which \none Party seeks to enforce its rights under this Agreement, the Promissory Note, or \nthe Final Consent Judgment , the prevailing Party shall be rewarded reasonable \nattorneys ' fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with any such action, \nincluding actions to enforce any judgment. \n(Id. \u00a7 15). \nThe Private Settlement Agreement states that Delaware law governs. (Id. \u00a7 23). \"Delaware \ncourts will generally honor a contractually-designated choice of law provision so long as the \njurisdiction selected bears some material relationship to the transaction.\" JS. Alberici Constr. Co. \nv. Mid-W Conveyor Co., 750 A.2d 518, 520 (Del. 2000). The Private Settlement Agreement and \nthe Final Consent Judgment are the product from a litigation in this Court. I will therefore apply \nDelaware law to interpret these agreements. The parties do not dispute that Delaware law applies. \nB. Actions Leading to Litigation in this Case \nSince settling the prior litigation , AgroFresh has sought to obtain patent rights in other \ncountries. On July 25, 2018, AgroFresh requested Dr. Mir \"execute certain documents necessary \nto confirm AgroFresh's ownership of foreign applications related to the patents identified in \nparagraph 7(a) of the Final Consent Judgment. \" (D.I. 19 at 47; D.I. 8-4, Ex. DD at 2-3). AgroFresh \nmade similar requests that Dr. Mir execute some of these documents on six separate occasions \nthereafter. (D.I. 72 at 4-7; D.I. 85 at 9; D.I. 8-4, Ex. DD (letter dated July 25, 2018); D.I. 73-3, Ex. \n3 at 3-5 (email dated February 13, 2019), 29-31 (email dated December 20, 2018); D.I. 73-4, Ex. \n3 4 (email dated April 12, 2019); D.I. 8-8, Ex. HH (letter dated January 15, 2020); D.I. 8-5, Ex. EE \n(letter dated September 22, 2020). AgroFresh is no longer seeking Dr. Mir to execute any of the \ndocuments. (D.I. 73-6, Ex. 6 at 1; D.I. 88). \nIn September, 2020, the Mir Parties filed a lawsuit against AgroFresh asserting five claims: \na claim under the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (\"DTSA\") to require AgroFresh to define its \ntrade secret (Count I); a claim requesting the Court to construe the Final Consent Judgment and \nPrivate Settlement Agreement as an unlawful non-compete agreement (Count II); a claim for \nbreach of contract for breaching the Commercial Agreement and Consulting Agreement (which \nare separate from the Private Settlement Agreement and Final Consent Judgment) (Count III); a \nclaim of unjust enrichment based on the Commercial Agreement and Consulting Agreement \n(Count IV); and a request for a declaratory judgment. (D.I. 13 at 14-22; D.I. 38 at 5-9). I dismissed \nCounts I, II, and V without prejudice and Counts III and IV with prejudice. (D.I. 39). All counts \nremain dismissed. (D.I. 41). \nAgroFresh , however, counterclaimed. (D.I. 19). AgroFresh sought execution on the money \njudgment described in the Final Consent Judgment and Private Settlement Agreement \n(Counterclaim I); specific performance in the form of a court order directing the Mir Parties to \nexecute the necessary assignment paperwork (Counterclaim II); damages from the Mir Parties' \nbreach of the Private Settlement Agreement and Final Consent Judgment (Counterclaim III); a \ndeclaratory judgment that AgroFresh may execute on the Final Consent Judgment (Counterclaim \nIV); and attorneys' fees (Counterclaim V). (D.I. 19 at 41-58). \nThe money judgment in the Final Consent Judgment and Private Settlement Agreement \nhas by now been paid in full. (D.I. 72 at 9; D.I. 85 at 11; D.I. 61-5; see also D.I. 95). As a \n4 consequence, AgroFresh is not seeking summary judgment on Counterclaims I and IV. (See D.I. \n72 at 9). \nII. RULE 56(a) LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. \nCrv. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. Lamont \nv. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242,248 (1986)). \"[A] dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is sufficient \nto permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id The burden on the \nmoving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of \nevidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 \n(1986). \nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue \nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); Williams \nv. Borough of West Chester, 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving party asserting \nthat a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to particular parts \nof materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, \naffidavits or declarations , stipulations ... , admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; \nor (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish the absence ... of \na genuine dispute .... \" FED. R. Crv. P. 56(c)(l). The non-moving party's evidence \"must amount \nto more than a scintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than a \npreponderance.\" Williams, 891 F.2d at 460-61. \n5 When determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences \nin that party's favor. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007); Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, \n184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the non-moving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential \nelement of its case with respect to which it has the burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to \njudgment as a matter oflaw. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Withdrawal of Counterclaim II \nAgroFresh moved for summary judgment on Counterclaims II, III, and V. (D.I. 72 at 9). \nDuring the briefing on this motion, and after the Mir Parties filed their answering brief, Agro Fresh \nfiled a letter stating it was withdrawing Counterclaim II without prejudice. (D.I. 88). 1 The Mir \nParties dispute whether it was proper for Agro Fresh to withdraw its claims during briefing of the \nsummary judgment motion. (D.I. 90-2, Ex. A at 2-3). The Mir Parties argue the withdrawal is \nuntimely under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4l(a) & (c). (Id.). \nI agree with the Mir Parties that AgroFresh 's withdrawal of Counterclaim II is untimely \nunder Rule 4l(a). FED. R. CIV. P. 41. Rule 4l(a)(l)(A) permits a claim to be voluntarily dismissed \nwithout a court order \"by filing (i) a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an \nanswer or a motion for summary judgment ; or (ii) a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties \nwho have appeared .\" FED. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(l)(A)(i)-(ii). Rule 41(c) states, \"A claimant's voluntary \ndismissal under Rule 41(a)(l)(A)(i) must be made: \"(1) before a responsive pleading is served; or \n1 A week before AgroFresh filed its motion for summary judgment , I had encouraged the parties \nto avoid the over-litigation that I thought was happening in this case. AgroFresh referred to this \nencouragement as a part of the reason for its actions. I appreciate that. I applaud that. But I \nwould appreciate it even more if AgroFresh had been able to reach this conclusion before both \nsides had briefed the counterclaim. \n6 (2) if there is no responsive pleading, before evidence is introduced at a hearing or trial.\" FED. R. \nCrv. P. 41(c)(l)-(2). AgroFresh 's withdrawal of the claim during briefing for summary judgment \nwas not stipulated to by the parties, nor was it timely. (D.I. 88). AgroFresh has not sought a court \norder to dismiss the counterclaim. \nTherefore , I read AgroFresh 's letter to say that it is no longer requesting summary judgment \non Counterclaim II. See Bush v. Raytheon Co., 2009 WL 10669904 , at *10 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 8, \n2009), afj'd, 3 73 F. App'x 936 (11th Cir. 2010) (treating a withdrawal of a claim in response to a \nsummary judgment motion as an indication that the party does not oppose summary judgment on \nthat claim). \nSummary judgment on Counterclaim II is denied.2 I would sign a one-page motion to \ndismiss Counterclaim II (with or without the Mir Parties' consent) if it were presented to me. \nB. Breach of Contract \nAgroFresh alleges two separate theories for breach of contract. I address each theory in \nturn. \n1. Breach of Contract Under \u00a7 3 of the Private Settlement Agreement \nFirst, AgroFresh alleges that the Mir Parties breached \u00a7 3 of the Private Settlement \nAgreement, and by extension the Final Consent Judgment , by challenging the enforceability of the \nFinal Consent Judgment. (D.I. 19 at 56; D.I. 72 at 18-19). AgroFresh argues that the Mir Parties' \nclaims in this lawsuit sought to invalidate portions of the Final Consent Judgment and Private \nSettlement Agreement. \n2 In their Answering Brief, the Mir Parties (who apparentl y did not understand my comments about \nover-litigation) argue they are entitled to summary judgment on Counterclaim II and request that \nI use my authority under Rule 56(f) to grant it. (D.I. 85 at 31-32). I decline to do so. \n7 AgroFresh cites to the Mir Parties' First Amended Complaint (\"F AC\") for support. For \nexample, under Count I, the F AC states asserts the Final Consent Judgment is a \"nullity\" because \nit is \"ambiguous \" and \"gives no clarity as to what constitutes the trade secret that [Dr. Mir] is \nobligated to protect.\" (D.I. 13 at 16). AgroFresh argues that Count II of the FAC seeks to invalidate \nthe Final Consent Judgment as evidenced by its caption: \"THE COURT ORDER STATED AS \nA SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS NO LONGER ENFORCEABLE AS TO \n[AGROFRESH]'S TRADE SECRET .\" (Id.). AgroFresh contends that Count V of the FAC seeks \nto invalidate the Private Settlement Agreement as it recites, \"Part of the 2017 Agreement is no \nlonger enforceable. \" (Id. at 21 ). The Prayer for Relief section of the F AC requests that I declare \n\"the Court Order stated as a Settlement Agreement is no longer fully enforceable as to AgroFresh 's \ntrade secrets.\" (Id. at 23). \nAgroFresh argues that these references to invalidating the agreements or declaring that \n.I \ncertain provisions of the agreements are unenforceable demonstrates that the Mir Parties breached \n\u00a7 3 of the Private Settlement Agreement. (See D.I. 8-1, Ex. AA, ,r 2). \nThe Mir Parties argue that their complaint did not seek to invalidate the Private Settlement \nAgreement nor the Final Consent Judgment . (D.I. 85 at 29-30). The Mir Parties, instead, contend \nthat the complaint sought to define AgroFresh 's trade secret and/or to obtain a ruling stating that \nthe AgroFresh 's trade secret was outside the scope of the Private Settlement Agreement. The Mir \nParties argue that AgroFresh has not met its burden to establish there is no issue of material fact \nthat the Mir Parties breached the Private Settlement Agreement by filing this lawsuit. \nI agree with the Mir Parties that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they \nbreached the Private Settlement Agreement by filing their lawsuit. With respect to Count I of the \nF AC, a reasonable factfinder could determine that Count I has little to do with the Private \n8 Settlement Agreement and Final Consent Judgment , let alone invalidating them. Count I alleges \nthat AgroFresh 's \"claims precluding Dr. Mir from using its trade secrets violates\" the DTSA and \nthat AgroFresh has no trade secret to protect under the DTSA. (D.I. 13 at 14, 16). The FAC does \nrefer to the Final Consent Judgment as a \"nullity.\" (Id. at 16). Taking all reasonable inferences in \nfavor of the Mir Parties, a factfinder could determine that the statement is aimed to show \"there is \nno trade secret to be protected \" (D .I. 13 at 16), not that a term of the Final Consent Judgment is \ninvalid or generally unenforceable. Therefore , a reasonable factfinder could determine that \nbringing Count I does not breach the Private Settlement Agreement. \nA reasonable factfinder could find that Count II of the F AC does not breach the Private \nSettlement Agreement. What Count II pleads is not clear. (D.I. 13 at 16-18). Taking all reasonable \ninferences in favor of the Mir Parties, a reasonable factfinder could read Count II to contend either \nthat AgroFresh 's trade secret is outside the scope of the Private Settlement Agreement or that \nAgroFresh ' s interpretation of the trade secret is incorrect, rather than challenging the validity of \nthe Private Settlement Agreement. (D.I. 13 at 16 (\"AF's broad interpretation ... serves as a \nnoncompete agreement .... The Private Settlement Agreement is not enforceable as to \nAgroFresh's trade secret .... \")). Therefore , I find there is a genuine issue of material fact as to \nwhether bringing Count II breaches the Private Settlement Agreement. \nA reasonable factfinder could find that bringing Count V of the F AC does not constitute a \nbreach of the Private Settlement Agreement. While Count V of the F AC recites, \"Part of the 2017 \nPrivate Settlement Agreement is no longer enforceable \" (Id. at 21 ), it is not clear that Count V \nseeks to invalidate any part of the Private Settlement Agreement. As I noted when dismissing \nCount V, \"Count V does not clearly and expressly set forth what the Mir Parties would like the \nCourt to declare or the grounds pursuant to which they are entitled to those declarations. \" (D.I. 38 \n9 at 7). Given the lack of clarity, a reasonable factfinder could determine that Count V does not seek \nto invalidate any portion of the Private Settlement Agreement or the Final Consent Judgment. \nFor the reasons stated above, summary judgment on whether the Mir Parties breached the \nPrivate Settlement Agreement and the Final Consent Judgment by filing this lawsuit is denied. \n2. Breach of Contract Under\u00a7 2 of the Private Settlement Agreement \nSecond, AgroFresh argues that it is entitled to summary judgment for breach of contract \nbecause the Mir Parties failed to execute necessary paperwork to assign foreign patent applications \nto AgroFresh , breaching \u00a7 2 of the Private Settlement Agreement. Both parties agree that Final \nConsent Judgment and Private Settlement Agreement obligate the Mir Parties to \"execute all \nnecessary and appropriate documentation to confirm\" ownership. (D.I. 72 at 12 (citing D.I. 8-3, \nEx. CC\u00a7 7(a)); see also D.I. 8-1, Ex. AA\u00a7\u00a7 2, 20; D.I. 85 at 6). The issue here is whether the \ndocuments AgroFresh provided to the Mir Parties were necessary and/or appropriate. \nAgroFresh argues that the Mir Parties breached the agreements by failing to execute \nnecessary paperwork relating to the assignment of foreign patents and patent applications on at \nleast six occasions . Five of the six occasions involved multiple assignment documents. AgroFresh \ncites to emails and letters sent to the Mir Parties (or its attorneys) as evidence . For example, an \nemail sent on July 25, 2018, requested the Mir Parties execute seven documents: a revocation and \nappointment for Canadian Patent Application No . 2,910,332; a revocation and appointment for \nCanadian Patent Application No. 2,910,044; a deed of assignment for Indian Patent Application \nNo. 201737016801; a confirmatory assignment for European Patent Application No. 15858283.3 ; \nan assignment for European Patent Application No. 15858283.3 (\"AgroFresh's European \nAssignment Document \"); and a power of attorney form for Chilean patent applications. (D.I. 72 \nat 4-5 (citing D.I. 8-4 at 2-3)). AgroFresh cites to additional emails showing it attempted to get the Mir Parties to execute \nfive of the seven forms in December 2018, in April 2019, in January 2020, and September 2020. \n(D.I. 72 at 5-7; D.I. 73-3, Ex. 3 at 29-30; D.I. 73-4, Ex. 4 at 1; D.I. 8-8, Ex. HH at 3; D.I. 8-5, Ex. \nEE at 1-2). AgroFresh contends that the Mir Parties first returned signed forms on October 6, 2020, \nbut three of the four documents the Mir Parties sent back were not the documents requested. (D.I. \n72 at 7). Agro Fresh contends that two of the forms were forms the Mir Parties had signed in 2018 \n(and already found insufficient to transfer the patent applications) and the third document was the \nEuropean Patent Confirmatory Assignment form, which the Mir Parties had altered. (Id.).3 \nAgroFresh argues that the modification of the European Patent Application Confirmatory \nAssignment form made it \"unusable for the intended purpose.\" (D.I. 72 at 7). \nAgroFresh cites to a letter dated January 12, 2022, to show it requested the Mir Parties \nexecute an assignment for European Patent Application No. 15858283 .3.4 (D.I. 72 at 7 (citing D.I. \n73-6, Ex. 6 at 1)).5 AgroFresh contends that the Mir Parties did not sign the document . (D.I. 72 at \n7). \nAgroFresh argues that the Mir Parties breached the Private Settlement Agreement and the \nFinal Consent Judgment each time AgroFresh requested that the Mir Parties execute \"necessary \" \ndocuments to assign the foreign patent applications and the Mir Parties failed to do so. (D.I. 72 at \n3 The fourth document appears to be the document related to the Chilean application. (D.I. 19 at \n48). \n4 This document appears to be the same as AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document except \nthe date has changed to 2022 (D.I. 74-1, Ex. A; D.I. 74-2, Ex. B). Neither party has identified \nanything in substance that would distinguish this document from the previous one that would affect \ntheir claims. For simplicity, when I refer to AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document , that \nwill include this version along with the 2018 version. \n5 AgroFresh no longer sought execution of the other forms \"[d]ue to the passage of time.\" (D.I. \n73-6, Ex. 6 at 1 ). \n11 15). AgroFresh contends that due to the Mir Parties failure to execute the documents , AgroFresh \nsuffered damages in the form of attorneys' fees spent emailing and attempting to get the Mir Parties \nto sign the form. (Id. at 16). AgroFresh provides timesheets to demonstrate its expenses. (D.I. 73, \nExs. 9-11). \nAgroFresh argues that they should be entitled to summary judgment on the issue of breach \nof contract with respect to the non-European assignment documents . AgroFresh contends there is \nno dispute of fact on this issue because the Mir Parties only address why they did not sign the \nassignment forms for the European Patent Application , and \"offer no reason for refusing to sign \nthe other six documents .\" (D.I. 89 at 1). \nThe Mir Parties argue that summary judgment is not appropriate because there are genuine \nissues of material fact. \nThe Mir Parties state there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they were \nrequired to execute the proposed assignment forms. The Mir Parties cite AgroFresh 's response to \nthe Mir Parties' \"First Set of Discovery Requests\" to indicate that AgroFresh admits that, except \nfor the European Patent Application assignment agreement , the proposed assignment forms are \noutside the scope of their claims. (D.I. 85 at 7 (\"[AgroFresh] admitted and identified one document \nthat [the Mir Parties] refused to sign-the proposed Assignment of European Patent \nApplication. \")). \nAgroFresh 's discovery responses offer support for the Mir Parties' argument. For example, \nAgroFresh 's response to interrogatory No. 2 recites, \"AgroFresh states that the Mir Parties failed \nto execute the following documents in violation of their obligations under the Private Settlement \nAgreement and Final Consent Judgment : an assignment document related to European Patent \nApplication No. 15858283.3. \" (D.I. 85-9, Ex.Hat 4-5). AgroFresh 's position that its claims are \n12 limited to AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document is further emphasized in other responses \nto the interrogatories. For example, in response to request for admission number 2, AgroFresh \nnoted, \"AgroFresh 's claims ... only relate to the Mir Parties' failure to properly execute a \ndocument necessary for European Patent Application No. 15858283.3.\" (Id. at 5-6; see id. at 8 \n(same), 10 (same), 28 (same)). Therefore, the Mir Parties have identified facts in the record to raise \na dispute as to whether these other documents are at issue. 6 \nWith respect to AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document , the Mir Parties argue they \nare not in breach by refusing to sign the documents provided by AgroFresh. The Mir Parties \ncontend that the Private Settlement Agreement \"obligates [the Mir Parties] to execute any \n'paperwork necessary to confirm, perfect, and accomplish the assignments of any such inventions, \ndiscoveries, or improvements of AgroFresh.\"' (D.I. 85 at 12 (citing D.I. 8-1, ,r 2)). The Mir Parties \nargue that AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document \"does more than 'confirm, perfect, or \naccomplish' the assignment. \" (D.I. 85 at 12). \nThe Mir Parties, instead, contend that AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document goes \nbeyond the scope of the Private Settlement Agreement . (Id. at 14-15). For example, the Mir Parties \ncontend that the document requires \"Dr. Mir to assist in the prosecution of the patent [application] \nwithout [compensation].\" (Id. at 8). Overall, the Mir Parties argue that the European Patent \nAssignment gives AgroFresh seven additional rights and burdens the Mir Parties with six \nadditional obligations. (Id. at 14-15). The Mir Parties provide declarations from \"three legal \nexperts to establish that the proposed assignment did more than assign patents and patent \napplications as intended by the [Private Settlement Agreement]. \" (Id. at 13). \n6 The Mir Parties raise arguments related to this point in their sur-reply brief. (D.I. 90-2, Ex. A at \n4). I disregard those arguments as they should have been raised in their Answering Brief. \n13 The Mir Parties contend that Dr. Mir was prohibited from signing the documents because \nto do so would require Dr. Mir to perjure himself. (D.I. 85 at 8). The Mir Parties do not explain \nwhat this perjury would be, but it appears it would be because Dr. Mir and Mir Tech have an \nobligation to acknowledge the support from, and rights of, the U.S. government in the invention. \n(D.I. 8-6, Ex. FF at 2). \nThe Mir Parties also contend that AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document is not \nnecessary to transfer the patent application because other documents exist that would suffice to do \nso without bestowing additional rights on AgroFresh or burdening the Mir Parties with additional \nobligations. The Mir Parties argue that the only necessary documents to transfer the European \nPatent Application are the \"EPO standard assignment Forms 5050 and 5055.\" (D.I. 85 at 14). The \nMir Parties cite to their \"legal expert\" for support. (Id. ( citing D.I. 82, ,r 10)). \nThe Mir Parties question whether Agro Fresh has suffered damages if the Mir Parties are \nfound to have breached the Private Settlement Agreement and the Final Consent Judgment. The \nMir Parties cite to the fact that the '216 U.S. Patent has been finally invalidated7 and that the \nEuropean Patent Application No. 15858283.3 has been rejected \"for lack of novelty.\" (D.I. 85 at \n22-23). Therefore , the Mir Parties argue that AgroFresh cannot claim damages from not obtaining \nthe European patent. (Id.). The Mir Parties also contend there is an issue of material fact as to the \namount of damages AgroFresh could claim as their timesheets extend from 2018 -before the \nlawsuit was filed -to present -after the Mir Parties' claims were dismissed. (Id. at 23). \n7 The European Patent Application 15858283.3, which AgroFresh requests the Mir Parties to \ntransfer, \"is based on a Request for Entry into the European Phase of Patent Cooperation Treaty \nApplication No. PCT/US2015 /059680 ('PCT '680').\" (D.I. 84, if 4). PCT '680 claims priority to \nthe patent application that issued as the '216 Patent. (Id.). \n14 Both parties dispute the admissibility of the witness declarations submitted with their \nrespective briefs. Therefore, before determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists in \nthe record, I must first determine what evidence is in the record. \na. AgroFresh's Evidence \nAgroFresh has submitted three declarations: (1) the Stover Declaration (D.I. 73), (2) the \nJohnson Declaration (D.I. 74), and (3) the Williams Declaration (D.I. 75). The Mir Parties argue \nall three contain inadmissible evidence and should be disregarded for purposes of this motion. \ni. Stover Declaration \nThe Mir Parties argue that the Stover Declaration is inadmissible for a variety of reasons. \nFirst, the Mir Parties argue the declaration and exhibits should be ignored because Mr. Stover, as \nAgroFresh's attorney, cannot testify in this case. (D.I. 85 at 18-20). I disagree. He can submit a \ndeclaration. Mr. Stover's declaration mostly describes Agro Fresh documents produced in the \nlitigation. Mr. Stover provides the corresponding Bates Number for exhibits 1-8. \nExhibits 9-11 do not have a Bates Number. These exhibits are timesheets for documenting \nattorneys' fees. Mr. Stover, as an attorney at the law firm and participant in the case, would have \npersonal knowledge over those expenses. He also explains that they are admissible business \nrecords. \nTherefore, Mr. Stover's declaration and exhibits are admissible evidence. \nii. Johnson Declaration \nThe Mir Parties argue that the Johnson Declaration is inadmissible because it is not based \non Mr. Johnson's personal knowledge . (D.I. 85 at 20-21).8 I disagree. The Johnson Declaration \n8 In their sur-reply brief, the Mir Parties argue that the Johnson Declaration should be excluded \nbecause it is what was not disclosed before AgroFresh moved for summary judgment. (D.I. 90 at \n2-3; D.I. 90-2 at 5-6). This is an argument that could and should have been raised in their answering \nbrief. Therefore, the Mir Parties waived this argument. \n15 has two exhibits, which are the 2018 and 2022 versions of AgroFresh 's European Assignment \nDocument. (D.I. 74, Exs. A-B). The Johnson Declaration states that they were prepared by his law \nfirm, of which he is Patent Director. (D.I. 74, ,r,r 2, 5-6). Even if Mr. Johnson did not have a hand \nin preparing the documents , he has reviewed them. (Id., ,r,r 7-8). Mr. Johnson is registered as a \nPatent Attorney with the European Patent Office (Id., ,r 2), and, therefore , would at least be \nqualified to offer his opinion as to whether the documents would be accepted by the European \nPatent Office. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) (\"An affidavit ... used to support or oppose a motion \nmust ... show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\") \nThe Mir Parties also argue that Mr. Johnson's declaration does not provide facts to support \nhis conclusion that the documents are effective to transfer ownership . I find that this goes more to \nthe weight of the evidence rather than admissibility . \nTherefore , the Johnson Declaration is admissible . \nm. Williams Declaration \nThe Mir Parties argue that the Williams Declaration is inadmissible because it contains \nhearsay statements or states information about which Mr. Williams lacks personal knowledge. \n(D.I. 85 at 17-18). I agree. The statements in paragraphs 11, 22, and 26 are hearsay as they cite \nstatements made to Williams by other people. (D.I. 75, ,r,r 11 (\"AgroFresh's United States counsel, \nincluding myself, were informed by international counsel .... \"), 22 (\"AgroFresh's European \ncounsel explained to me .... \"), 26 (\"AgroFresh 's European counsel, ... again confirmed to me . \n. . . \"). This is classic hearsay. FED. R. Evrn. 802. AgroFresh does not argue that any hearsay \nexception applies. \nI also find that the Williams declaration is not admissible to the extent it states that the \ndocuments sent to the Mir Parties were necessary to transfer the patent applications . (See e.g., D.I. \n75, ,r,r 16, 20). Williams does not purport to be an expert on international law or the patent systems \n16 in foreign countries. Williams also acknowledges that he did not prepare the documents. (Id., 1 14 \n(\"Counsel in each respective jurisdiction prepared the documents sent to the Mir Parties on July \n25, 2018.\")). \nThe Williams declaration is admissible on issues that are not in dispute: that AgroFresh \nsent the notices to the Mir Parties informing them that certain documents needed to be signed. The \nWilliams declaration is not admissible to the extent it purports to support the substance of the \nnotices or the necessity or adequacy of the assignment documents . \nb. Mir Parties' Evidence \nIn their Answering Brief, the Mir Parties provide declarations of three \"legal experts\" for \nsupport: the Rueppell Affidavit (D.I. 84); the Richards Affidavit (D.I. 82); and the Heble Affidavit \n(D.I. 83). The Mir Parties also provide the Yam Affidavit , which appears to be an affidavit from a \nfact witness. (D.I. 80). \nAgroFresh argues that these declarations are untimely under Rule 26(a)(2)(A)-(B). (D.I. 89 \nat 6-8). \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 3 7 ( c )( 1) provides, \"If a party fails to provide information \nor identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) ... the party is not allowed to use that information \nor witness to supply evidence on a motion ... unless the failure was justified or is harmless.\" FED. \nR. Crv. P. 37(c)(l). AgroFresh contends that Rule 37(c)(l) dictates the declarations should be \nstruck because the Mir Parties first disclosed them to AgroFresh with their answering brief, well \npast the close of discovery . (D.I. 89 at 7). \nThe Mir Parties argue the declarations are not untimely. The Mir Parties cite to Rule \n26(a)(2)(D), which recites: \n(DJ Time to Disclose Expert Testimony. A party must make these disclosures at \nthe times and in the sequence that the court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court \norder, the disclosures must be made: \n17 (i) at least 90 days before the date set for trial or for the case to be ready for \ntrial; or \n(ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the \nsame subject matter identified by another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) or (C), \nwithin 30 days after the other party's disclosure . \nThe Mir Parties argue that the scheduling order is silent as to the disclosure of expert witnesses \nand a trial date has not been set (D.I. 44), and, therefore, they comply with Rule 26(a)(2)(D)(i). \n(D.I. 90-2, Ex. A at 4-5). In the alternative , the Mir Parties argue that the declarations are being \noffered to rebut evidence provided by AgroFresh in its motion for summary judgment , and they \nprovided the evidence within 30 days of that disclosure . (Id. at 5). The Mir Parties, therefore , argue \nthey comply with Rule 26(a)(2)( D)(ii). \nI find the declarations are admissible under Rule 26(a)(2)( D)(i). The scheduling order is \nsilent with respect to the disclosure of expert witnesses. (D.I. 44). AgroFresh cites to Nippo \nCorp./Int'l Bridge Corp. v. AMEC Earth & Env't, Inc., 2011 WL 1196922, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Mar. \n30, 2011) for support that a declaration attached to a summary judgment motion should be \nexcluded. In Nippo, however, the scheduling order specified a deadline for expert reports. That \ndeadline is missing here. \nI now turn to each declaration. \n1. Rueppell Affidavit \nThe Rueppell Affidavit is offered as a declaration from a \"legal expert.\" Much of this \naffidavit, however, purports to offer legal conclusions that are for me to draw. Mr. Rueppell does \nnot purport to know anything about the European Patent Office procedures. Paragraphs 4-11 \nappear to interpret Agro Fresh' s European Assignment Document using typical contractual \ninterpretation principles. (D.I. 84-1, Ex. 1). To put it another way, this is just attorney argument, \nnot expert testimony. Contract interpretation is a job for the Court. Therefore , I find such \nstatements to have no evidentiary value. \n18 Paragraph s 12-13 appear to be Mr. Rueppell testifying about content of emails. (D.I. 84-1, \nEx. 3; D.I. 84-1, Ex. 4). To the extent he is testifying to the truth of the matters asserted in those \nemails, that is clearly hearsay. The opinions of other lawyers stated in emails carry no weight. \nTherefore , the Rueppell Affidavit is admissible , but, for the reasons stated above, has little \nuseful evidentiary value. \nii. Richards Affidavit \nThe Richards Affidavit is admissible. Mr. Richards is a European Patent Attorney and \nadmitted to practice before the European Patent Office. (D.I. 82-3, Ex. 1). He offers his opinions \non the procedures and practices of the European Patent Office, and whether the assignment form \n(D.I. 82-3, Ex. 3) complies with the European Patent Convention. See FED. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) \n(\"An affidavit ... used to support or oppose a motion must ... show that the affiant or declarant \nis competent to testify on the matters stated.\"). \niii. Heble Affidavit \nI find the Heble Affidavit has little evidentiary value. Dr. Heble states he has \"significant \nexperience developing and managing patent portfolios in Europe.\" (D.I. 83, ,r 2). His CV states \nthat he has \"prepared and prosecuted global patent portfolio[s] ,\" provided guidance on global IP \nstrategies , and has experience with EP oppositions . (D.I. 83-6). That does not establish that Dr. \nHeble has had experience with the European Patent Office. Dr. Heble is not admitted to practice \nbefore or licensed with the European Patent Office. (D.I. 83-6). \nDr. Heble purports to identify (1) a way to cure a submission to the EPO and (2) language \nin AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document that is unnecessary to effectuate the transfer of \nthe European Patent Application. (D.I. 83, ,r,r 10-11). Given that Dr. Heble's credentials do not \nsupport that he is qualified to testify about these topics, I will disregard these opinions. See FED. \nR. Crv. P. 56(c)(4). \n19 iv. Yam Affidavit \nThe Yam Affidavit is not admissible . Dr. Yam appears to be testifying as a fact witness, \nrather than an expert witness, and therefore Rule 26(a)(2)(D) does not apply to him. The Mir \nParties offer no explanation as to why Dr. Yam was not previousl y disclosed under Rule 26(a)(l) \nor why his disclosure now is timely. (See D.I. 90-2, Ex. A at 4-5 (addressing only the \"three expert \nwitnesses \")). Therefore , the Yam Affidavit is not considered for purposes of this motion. \nc. Merits of the Breach of Contract Claims \nAfter reviewing the evidence in the record, I find there exist genuine issues of material \nfacts with respect to both of AgroFresh 's theories for breach of contract. \ni. Assignment Documents for Non-European Patent \nApplications \nThe Mir Parties citation to AgroFresh 's interrogatory responses indicate that AgroFresh \ntook the position in this litigation that only the European Patent Application assignment documents \nwere at issue. There is at least an issue of material fact as to whether AgroFresh claims relating to \nthe non-European Patent Application documents are relevant to their claims for breach of the \nPrivate Settlement Agreement or if it waived such claims. Therefore , summary judgment on \nAgroFresh 's claims for breach of contract for the Mir Parties' failure to execute these documents \nis denied. \nn. AgroFresh's European Assignment Document \nWith respect to AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document , I find there is a genuine \nissue of material fact as to whether this agreement is \"necessary \" and/or \"appropriate. \" \nAgroFresh has established there is no dispute of material fact that the agreement would \ntransfer the application . AgroFresh 's witness Mr. Johnson states that the European Patent Office \n20 would have accepted the agreement. (D.I. 74, ,r,r 7-8). The Mir Parties do not offer any evidence \nto show that the document would not be effective. \nThe Mir Parties, however, argue that AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document goes \nbeyond being what is \"necessary \" for the transfer. (D.I. 85 at 12-16). The Mir Parties have \nidentified aspects of AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document that may go beyond the Private \nSettlement Agreement and may not be necessary to transfer ownership of the patent. For example, \nthe Richards Affidavit states, \"[N]othing in the European Patent Convention requires any \nstatement of the reasons why an assignment is made, any obligation with respect [to] know-how , \nwarranties about the property being transferred or appointment of anyone as their attorney.\" (D.I. \n82, \u00a7 11). AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document does relate to the transfer of\"Know-how \" \nand contains additional warranties . (D.I. 8-4, Ex. DD at 10-11). \nThe Mir Parties argue that the agreement is not \"necessary \" because the European Patent \nOffice's Forms EP5050 and EP5055 would be sufficient to effectuate the transfer. (D.I. 85 at 14). \nThey may even be right. (See D.I. 88).9 The Mir Parties cite to these forms to support their \nargument that AgroFresh 's European Assignment Document contains unnecessary provisions. \n(Id.). The Richards Affidavit supports this. (D.I. 82, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10) \nAgroFresh does not address the Mir Parties' arguments that AgroFresh 's European \nAssignment Document conveys more than is covered by the Private Settlement Agreement. \nNeither does AgroFresh address whether the forms cited by the Mir Parties would be sufficient to \nassign the patent application . \n9 Ten months have passed. Whether the forms were actually submitted , and, if so, whether they \nwere considered sufficient , are not in the record. I would have expected AgroFresh to advise me \nif they had been rejected. \n21 I find there is a genume issue of material fact as to whether AgroFresh 's European \nAssignment Document is \"necessary \" and/or \"appropriate \" to effectuate transfer. Therefore , \nAgroFresh 's motion for summary judgment is denied. \nC. Attorneys' Fees \nBecause I have denied AgroFresh's motions for summary judgment on breach of contract, \nit 1s premature to identify a prevailing party. Therefore , AgroFresh 's motion for summary \njudgment for attorneys ' fees is also denied. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, AgroFresh 's motion is denied. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n22 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nMIRTECH , INC., and DR.
