No. 22-me-80-RGA-SRF\n\nTO CONDUCT DISCOVERY FOR USE)\nIN A FOREIGN PROCEEDING )\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nPresently before the court in this miscellaneous action is the motion of Caroline Forbes\nSevier (\u201cApplicant\u201d) to compel Grabien, Inc. (\u201cGrabien\u201d) to produce documents in accordance\nwith the subpoena served on Grabien pursuant to the Order Granting Application Pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1782. (D.I. 7) As announced from the bench on August 31, 2022, the motion to\ncompel is GRANTED-IN-PART.\nL BACKGROUND\n\nOn May 22, 2020, Applicant entered into an agreement for the dissolution of her\nmarriage to Thomas Elliott in Madrid, Spain (the \u201cDivorce Agreement\u201d). (D.I. 7-3 at 26-40)\nThe Divorce Agreement resolved issues of spousal support and custody of the former couple\u2019s\nchildren, but it expressly reserved settlement of the division of marital property for a later time:\n\u201cThe marital property system of its nationality is dissolved by divorce, and its settlement will be\nprocessed later on.\u201d (Id. at 39) Applicant and Mr. Elliott were granted a judgment of divorce by\nthe Spanish courts on August 11, 2020. (DI. 4 at \u00a7 4)\n\nApplicant\u2019s Spanish counsel then filed a Preliminary Proceeding Application with the\nappropriate Spanish court to compel Mr. Elliott to produce an inventory of assets. (D.I. 7-5 at 2,\n46) On November 18, 2021, the Spanish court denied Applicant\u2019s Preliminary Proceeding\n\nApplication based on findings that: (1) the document request exceeded the scope of necessary\n\ndiscovery; (2) proof that Mr. Elliott refused to voluntarily provide the discovery was not\nprovided; and (3) there was no proof that the aid of courts was necessary to procure the\ninformation. (D.I. 7-5 at 43) In accordance with this ruling, Applicant sent a letter to Mr. Elliott\nby Burofax on June 1, 2021, seeking Mr. Elliott\u2019s voluntary production of the requested\ninformation. (D.I. 7-3 at 41-45; DI. 4 at \u00a214) Mr. Elliott did not respond. (D.I. 7-3 at 4, \u00a5 8;\nDI. 7-5 at 3, { 8)\n\nOn February 11, 2022, Applicant initiated this miscellaneous action by filing an ex parte\napplication to conduct discovery under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 (the \u201cApplication\u201d), along with a\nproposed subpoena. (D.I. 1) The discovery sought by Applicant in this matter pertains to the\nvaluation of Grabien, a Delaware corporation formed by Mr. Elliott during his marriage to\nApplicant. (/d.; D.I. 4 at 8) According to Applicant, this discovery is a necessary predicate to\nthe distribution of marital property in a proceeding before a court of special jurisdiction in\nMadrid, Spain (the \u201cAncillary Property Division\u201d). (D.1. 7-5 at 2, 45)\n\nThe court entered an order granting the Application on February 16, 2022, and Applicant\nserved the subpoena and the order of the court on Grabien the following day. (D.I.5; D.L. 7-2 at\n2) The subpoena set March 21, 2022, as the deadline for the production of documents. (D.I. 7-2\nat 3) On that date, counsel for Grabien sent a letter to Applicant setting forth its objections to the\nsubpoena and the order granting the Application. (D.I. 7-3)\n\nHaving received no production in response to the subpoena, on July 8, 2022, Applicant\nmoved to reopen the case and simultaneously filed a motion to compel Grabien to produce\ndocuments in accordance with the subpoena. (D.I. 6; D.I. 7) The court granted the motion to\nreopen the case and referred the motion to compel to the undersigned judicial officer. (DL 8;\n\nD.L. 9) Oral argument was heard on August 31, 2022, and the matter is now ripe for resolution.\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nIt is undisputed that the statutory requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 have been met. (D.I.\n14 at 4) The parties dispute the timeliness of Grabien\u2019s objections to the subpoena and the\nrelevance and scope of the document requests.\n\nA. Waiver of Objections to Subpoena\n\nGrabien waived its objections to the subpoena by failing to timely raise those objections.\nSee Am. Fed\u2019n of Musicians of the U.S. & Canada v. Skodam Films, LLC, 313 F.R.D. 39, 43\n(ND. Tex. Dec. 3, 2015). Rule 45(d)(2)(B) states that objections to a subpoena \u201cmust be served\nbefore the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served.\u201d\nFed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(2)(B). There is no dispute that Grabien was served with the subpoena on\nFebruary 17, 2022. (D.I. 7-2 at 2) Thus, Grabien\u2019s objections were due on March 3, 2022. Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 45(d)(2)(B). Here, Grabien raised its objections to the subpoena for the first time on\nMarch 21, 2022, more than a month after Applicant served the subpoena. (D.I. 7-3 at 2-3; DL.\n14 at 5)\n\nAlthough a court may consider objections filed after the deadline if the respondent\nestablishes good cause or the existence of unusual circumstances, no such showing has been\nmade in this case. See Pinchuk v. Chemstar Prods. LLC, C.A. No. 13-mc-306-RGA, 2014 WL\n2990416, at *1 n.1 (D. Del. June 26, 2014); see also Williams v. Big Picture Loans, LLC, 303 F.\nSupp. 3d 434, 441-42 (E.D. Va. 2018). Grabien\u2019s suggestion that it was \u201cwithout knowledge\nthat [Applicant] had commenced this proceeding in US Court\u201d is unsupported. (D.I. 14 at 5)\nThe Application was accompanied by a certificate of service confirming that Grabien and Mr.\nElliott were served by certified mail, return receipt requested, on February 11, 2022. (D.I. 1 at 4)\n\nThe subpoena itself was served on Grabien\u2019s registered agent on February 17, 2022. (D.L. 7-2 at\n2) Grabien does not deny that it received service of the subpoena on that date. Any delays\nresulting from efforts to obtain legal representation in the U.S. are not supported by the record.\nbefore the court, and no requests for extension of time were filed with the court or otherwise\ndocumented. (D.I. 14 at 5); see Am. Fed\u2019n, 313 F.R.D. at 43 (\u201cThe serving party may agree to\nextend the deadline to respond to a subpoena, including the deadline to serve written objections.\u201d\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).\n\nGrabien broadly suggests that it \u201cmade a good faith effort to comply with the Subpoena,\u201d\nwithout citations to the record in support of this representation. (D.I. 14 at 5) For the reasons\npreviously discussed, the objections raised in Grabien\u2019s March 21 letter were untimely, and the\ncontent of the letter confirms Grabien\u2019s refusal to produce any documents in response to the\nsubpoena. (D.I. 7-3) Although Grabien\u2019s letter suggests that the Application itself is improper,\nthe record shows that Grabien did not file a motion to vacate the order granting the Application,\nnor did it move to quash the subpoena. (Jd. at 1) Grabien\u2019s comprehensive refusal to produce\nany documents responsive to the subpoena and its failure to properly pursue its objections to the\nsubpoena in a timely manner contradict its allegations of good faith.\n\nB. Consideration of the Discretionary Factors\n\nEven if the court were to conclude that Grabien did not waive its objections, those\nobjections do not warrant denying Applicant\u2019s requested relief in its entirety. The Supreme\nCourt has set forth four discretionary factors to consider in ruling on a request under \u00a7 1782: (1)\nwhether \u201cthe person from whom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding;\u201d\n(2) \u201cthe nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and the\nreceptivity of the foreign [tribunal] to U.S. federal-court judicial assistance;\u201d (3) \u201cwhether the \u00a7\n\n1782(a) request conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other\n\npolicies;\u201d and (4) whether the request is \u201cunduly intrusive or burdensome.\u201d Intel Corp. v.\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241, 264-65 (2004); see In re Syngenta Crop Protection\nAG, C.A. No. 21-me-375-CFC, 2022 WL 1690832, at *1 (D. Del. May 26, 2022). Grabien does\nnot contest the first factor, and it is undisputed that Grabien is not a participant in the Ancillary\nProperty Division proceeding.\n\nRegarding the second factor, Grabien does not dispute that the Ancillary Property\nDivision requires a petitioning party to provide an inventory of assets for the Spanish court to\ndivide and distribute the marital assets. (D.1. 7, Ex. D at 15) The issue of whether Grabien\nqualifies as a marital asset is to be resolved in the Ancillary Property Division proceeding and is\nnot before this court. (Jd.) Only the relevance of the discovery and the scope of the discovery\nrequests are at issue here. See In re Martin & Harris Priv. Ltd., 2021 WL 2434069, at *5 (D.N.J.\nJune 14, 2021) (explaining that the test for the second Jntel factor \u201cis not whether the foreign\ntribunal ultimately will admit the discovery sought into evidence at trial.\u201d).\n\nGrabien\u2019s argument regarding the third Intel factor rests solely on the Spanish court\u2019s\ndenial of Applicant\u2019s Preliminary Proceeding Application. (D.I. 14 at 4) But Applicant has\nsince established that Mr. Elliott refused to voluntarily provide the requested discovery, and\nGrabien\u2019s incorporation in Delaware makes it likely that the records can be obtained pursuant to\nthe subpoena. See In re Martin & Harris, 2021 WL 2434069, at *5 (explaining that \u201c[t]he\ndecision of how to seek discovery lies with the party seeking the discovery,\u201d and rejecting the\nnotion that \u00a7 1782 includes an exhaustion requirement). Because the circumstances have since\nchanged, the bases for the Spanish court\u2019s rejection of the Preliminary Proceeding Application\n\ndo not control the instant analysis.\n\nAs to the fourth and final Jnte/ factor, the court-has discretion to consider whether the\ninformation sought in the subpoena is overbroad, disproportionate, or unduly burdensome. See\nInre Martin & Harris, 2021 WL 2434069, at *7. This analysis requires application of the Rule\n26 standard to determine whether the requested discovery \u201cis relevant to any party\u2019s claim or\ndefense and proportional to the needs of the case[.]\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Grabien conflates\nthis standard with the requirements of Rule 26 prior to the 2015 amendment, i.e., whether the\nrequested discovery was \u201creasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d\n(DL 14 at 5)\n\nThe supplemental affidavit of Veronica Gonzalez-Choren Respaldiza establishes the\nrelevance of the requested information, explaining that the procedure for filing a request for the\ndivision and distribution of marital assets must be predicated by the submission of an inventory\nof assets. (D.I. 7, Ex. D at {5) Grabien does not dispute this requirement. Applicants stated\ngoal is to obtain valuation information regarding Grabien so that it may include that information\nin the inventory of assets to be submitted to the Ancillary Property Division. (D.I. 7 at 5)\n\nHowever, the documents requested under the subpoena go well beyond what is necessary\nto ascertain Grabien\u2019s value. (D.I. 7-2 at 14-15) Production of Grabien\u2019s corporate tax returns,\nforeign income reports, interim and year-end financial statements, and backup copy of Grabien\u2019s\ninternal accounting software in response to Document Request Nos. 1 to 5 would provide a\nsummary overview of Grabien\u2019s assets and liabilities from 2019, the year preceding the Divorce\nAgreement, through 2021. (D.I. 7-2 at 14) Such information should be reasonably sufficient for\ndetermining the current valuation of the company. Moreover, Mr. Elliott avers that he is the\nPresident and main shareholder of Grabien and such information concerning the company\u2019s\n\nincorporation and shareholders is publicly available to Applicant. (D.L 14 at 1, 4-5) To the\n\nextent that such information is not publicly available, Grabien shall produce information\nsufficient to inform Applicant of the corporation\u2019s officers, directors, and shareholders from\n2019 to 2021. The production of this discovery shall be made on or before September 14, 2022,\nand the parties shall meet and confer on a form of protective order governing access to the\ndiscovery.\n\nThe remaining requests are directed to documents showing Grabien\u2019s assets and\nliabilities at a granular level. (D.1. 7-2 at 14-15) Some of these documents may likely form the\nunderlying basis of Grabien\u2019s tax returns and financial statements and would, therefore, be\nredundant of the information already produced in the narrowed responses to Document Request\nNos. 1 to 5. At this stage, Applicant has established no record to seek broad categories of\nfinancials or question the accuracy of Grabien\u2019s tax returns and financial statements. Thus,\nproduction of documents responsive to Document Request Nos. 6 to 22 is disproportionate to\nApplicant\u2019s stated needs. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s motion to compel is GRANTED as\nnarrowed to the 2019-2021 time frame with respect to Document Request Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5.\nApplicant\u2019s motion is further GRANTED with respect to Document Request No. 2, to the extent\nthat Grabien has possession, custody, or control of responsive documents. Grabien shall also\nproduce information sufficient to identify Grabien\u2019s corporate officers, directors and\nshareholders from 2019 to 2021 to the extent that this information is not publicly available.\nApplicant\u2019s motion to compel is DENIED without prejudice as to Document Request Nos. 6 to\n22. Ud.)\n\nIll. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Applicant\u2019s motion to compel is GRANTED-IN-PART. (DI.\n\n7) Specifically, Applicant\u2019s motion to compel is GRANTED with respect to Document Request\n\nNos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 for the narrowed time period from 2019 through 2021. Applicant\u2019s motion is\nGRANTED with respect to Document Request No. 2 for the time period from 2019 through\n2021, to the extent that responsive documents are in Grabien\u2019s possession, custody, or control.\nGrabien shall also produce information sufficient to identify its officers, directors, and\nshareholders from 2019 to 2021 to the extent that such information is not publicly available.\nGrabien shall produce the responsive documents on or before September 14, 2022, and the\nparties shall meet and confer on a form of protective order governing access to the discovery.\nApplicant\u2019s motion is DENIED with respect to Document Request Nos. 6 to 22. An Order\nconsistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nThis Memorandum Opinion is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Opinion. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to five (5) pages each.\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nwww.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: August 31, 2022\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nIN RE EX PARTE APPLICATION OF )\nCAROLINE FORBES SEVIER FOR AN _ )\nORDER PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 ) C.A.

(D.I. 7), and for the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion issued\nthis same date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Applicant\u2019s motion to compel is GRANTED\nwith respect to Document Request Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 for the narrowed time period from 2019\nthrough 2021.
