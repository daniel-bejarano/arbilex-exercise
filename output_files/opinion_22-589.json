(collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d).\n(D.L 13)! For the following reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-PART Defendants\u2019\npartial motion to dismiss.\nIL. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs Cilag GmbH International (\u201cCilag\u201d) and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (\u201cJanssen\nBiotech;\u201d collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed this action in the Superior Court for the State of\n\nDelaware on April 28, 2022, and Defendants removed the action to this court on May 2, 2022,\n\nbased on diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). (D.I. 1 & Ex. B) The complaint\n\n' The briefing associated with the pending motions is found at D.I. 14, D.I. 16, and D.I. 18.\n\nasserts four causes of action based on alleged breaches of a 2006 Development and Supply\nAgreement (\u201cDSA\u201d) executed between Cilag and Hospira, and a 2017 Quality Technical\nAgreement (\u201cQTA\u201d) executed between Hospira, Inc. and non-party Janssen Pharmaceuticals.\n(D.L 1, Ex. B at ff 1, 7)\n\nReoPro\u00ae is a blood thinner medication used to prevent narrowing of the arteries in\npatients undergoing coronary procedures. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at 13) Before the DSA was signed,\nCilag was responsible for contracting with a manufacturer capable of producing sufficient\nquantities to meet the worldwide demand for ReoPro\u00ae. (id. at { 14) On May 1, 2006, Cilag and\nHospira executed the DSA to govern the supply and manufacture of ReoPro\u00ae. (/d. at \u00a215) The\nDSA provided that Cilag would supply Hospira with the active biologic ingredient for ReoPro\u00ae,\nand Hospira would exclusively manufacture and supply ReoPro\u00ae to Cilag in exchange for a\ncontractually agreed-upon per-vial price. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at \u00a7f 16, 21; id, Ex. B at Ex. A, \u00a7 5.8 &\nEx. 5.8) To achieve these ends, Cilag agreed to provide technical support to enable Hospira to\nset up its manufacturing facility in McPherson, Kansas (the \u201cHospira Facility\u201d) for the\nproduction and manufacture of ReoPro\u00ae. (/d., Ex. B at \u00a7 19) In addition to Hospira\u2019s\nproduction requirements, the DSA imposed various quality-related requirements on Hospira.\nUd., Ex. B at J 22)\n\nHospira\u2019s technical obligations under the DSA were further specified in the Quality\nTechnical Agreement (\u201cQTA\u201d) executed between Hospira, Inc. and non-party Janssen\nPharmaceuticals on May 23, 2017. (D.L. 1, Ex. B at J] 33-39; Ex. B at Ex. B) The QTA, which\nwas incorporated by reference into the DSA, mandated that Hospira, Inc. must \u201cprovide adequate\nresources, including the assignment of trained personnel, in order to... . manufacture the\n\nrequested quantities of [ReoPro]\u201d conflo]rming with the specified requirements.\u201d (D.I. 1, Ex. B\nat 1 37; Ex. B at Ex. A, \u00a7 6.3; Ex. B, \u00a7 9.2) The QTA governs Hospira, Inc.\u2019s \u201cquality-related\nresponsibilities,\u201d while the DSA \u201cshall control for all other provisions\u201d in the event of a conflict\nbetween the QTA and DSA. (Id., Ex. B at | 34)\n\nBeginning in 2016, the FDA began auditing the Hospira Facility. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at 40)\nIn February 2017, those audits culminated in the issuance of a Warning Letter to Hospira, which\ndescribed \u201csignificant violations of current good manufacturing practice regulations for finished\npharmaceuticals,\u201d resulting in the production of adulterated drug products. (/d.) These supplier\nquality concerns resulted in shortages of ReoPro\u00ae, as four of the final five fills of ReoPro\u00ae\nbetween October 2017 and April 2018 were rejected for quality failures. (Jd. at {{[ 42-43) In\naddition, Janssen Biotech had previously rejected lots of ReoPro\u00ae for quality deficiencies due to\ncontamination by particulate matter. (Ud. at 43)\n\nHospira shut down production at the Hospira Facility in 2017 to remediate the problems\nidentified by the FDA. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at 945) As a result, ReoPro\u00ae was globally placed on back\norder, and customers began using alternative products. (/d.) The complaint does not specify\nhow long the Hospira Facility was closed.\n\nIn June 2018, Hospira notified Cilag of its intention to terminate the DSA as of December\n31, 2020. (id. at 146) Defendants\u2019 failure to meet their obligations under the DSA and QTA\ncontinued through the termination of the DSA. (Id. at \u00a7 44) Because it would take twenty-four\nmonths for Cilag to obtain another qualified and approved replacement manufacturer, Plaintiffs\ndiscontinued worldwide sales of ReoPro\u00ae during this time. (/d. at J] 46, 54) Asa result of\nDefendants\u2019 failure to comply with their obligations under the DSA and QTA, Plaintiffs suffered\n\nsubstantial financial losses. Ud. at [J 50-52)\n\nDefendants filed the pending motion on July 1, 2022, seeking dismissal of Counts II, HI,\nand IV of the complaint, as well as Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for lost profits. (D.I. 13; D.L. 14) The\npending motion is not directed to Count I of the complaint for Cilag\u2019s allegations of breach of\ncontract against Hospira. Count IJ asserts a cause of action by Janssen Biotech for breach of\ncontract against Defendants. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at \u00a7\u00a7 69-73) Counts III and IV assert causes of\naction against Defendants for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\nbrought by Cilag and Janssen Biotech, respectively. (Id. at {{] 74-84)\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,\n790-91 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\ny. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged. Igbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 USS. at 555-56.\n\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\n\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted), This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Jgbal, 556 US. at\n663-64.\n\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Consequential Damages\n\nSection 8.6 of the DSA bars the parties\u2019 recovery of consequential damages in the event\nof a breach:\n\nNEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR INDIRECT,\n\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n\nDAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT\n\nEVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n(D1. 1, Ex. B at Ex. A, \u00a7 8.6) The parties disagree as to whether the term \u201cconsequential\ndamages\u201d in \u00a7 8.6 includes profits lost by Cilag and its Affiliates as a result of Hospira\u2019s\nmanufacturing deficiencies.\n\nDefendants argue that the court should dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 pleaded claims for lost profits\nbecause these damages are expressly barred by the DSA\u2019s prohibition against the recovery of\nconsequential damages. (D.I. 14 at 7-12) According to Defendants, it is apparent from the face\nof the complaint that the damages are consequential because Plaintiffs seek recovery for\n\ncollateral, future sales of ReoPro\u00ae to third parties by Janssen Biotech, a non-party to the DSA.\n\n(Id, at 10-11) Defendants dispute the reasonableness of Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Hospira\u2019s own\n\nprofits were tied to profits earned on the sale of ReoPro\u00ae because Hospira was paid a fixed price\nper vial unconnected to subsequent sales of the product by Cilag. (/d. at 11)\n\nPlaintiffs respond that the lost profits sought in the complaint are direct, not\nconsequential damages, because they are immediately and foreseeably linked to Hospira\u2019s failure\nto manufacture ReoPro\u00ae for commercial sale by Cilag and its Affiliates. (D.I. 16 at 12-14) Had\nthe parties intended to exclude the recovery of lost profits, Plaintiffs argue that the DSA would\nhave expressly identified lost profits as an excluded remedy. (/d. at 10-11) As it stands,\nPlaintiffs explain that the only express exclusion of lost profits under the DSA arises in the\ncontext of a product recall, which is inapplicable to the facts of this case. (/d.) Plaintiffs further\ncontend that the issue of whether damages are direct or consequential is a question of fact not\nappropriately resolved on a motion to dismiss. (/d. at 14-15)\n\nCase authorities cited by both parties confirm that lost profits \u201cmay be classified as either\ndirect damages or consequential damages, depending on the factual situation[.]\u201d No Spill, Inc. v.\nScepter Canada, Inc., 429 F. Supp. 3d 768, 782 (D. Kan. 2019) (citing Penncro Assocs., Inc. v.\nSprint Spectrum, L.P., 499 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2007); see also eCommerce Indus., Inc. v. MWA\nIntelligence, Inc., 2013 WL 5621678, at *47 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2013). Plaintiffs have alleged\nthat their lost profits are direct damages: \u201cHospira\u2019s failure to meet its required production under\nthe [DSA] directly resulted in Cilag/Janssen\u2019s inability to sell the product Hospira was supposed\nto manufacture,\u201d causing Plaintiffs to \u201clos[e] any ability to sell ReoPro\u00ae and profit from the\n[DSA]\u201d and thereby denying them the benefit of their bargain. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at 73) The\ncomplaint further alleges that, \u201cabsent an award of lost profits, Cilag/Janssen would be left\nwithout any remedy as to lost sales of ReoPro\u00ae, which are a direct result of Hospira\u2019s breaches.\u201d\n\n(id. at { 28) At this stage of the case, the court must accept these allegations as true. See\nCrewFacilities.com, LLC v. HotelEngine, Inc., C.A. No. 20-1637-RGA, 2021 WL 2649758, at\n*3 (D. Del. June 28, 2021) (\u201cDetermination of the categorization of damages is not an issue that\nthis Court will decide during a motion to dismiss.\u201d).\n\nMoreover, Plaintiffs rely on a plausible interpretation of the DSA in support of their\nposition that lost profits are direct damages. As previously stated, lost profits can be either direct\nor consequential damages, and the express exclusion of consequential damages in \u00a7 8.6 does not\npreclude the recovery of direct damages. See eCommerce, 2013 WL 5621678, at *47. Section\n2.1 of the DSA expressly associates Hospira\u2019s manufacture of ReoPro\u00ae with Cilag\u2019s commercial\nsale of ReoPro\u00ae. (D.1. 1, Ex. B at Ex. A, \u00a7 2.1) Citing Biotronik A.G. v. Conor Medsys.\nIreland, Ltd., Plaintiffs plausibly allege that, under \u00a7 2.1 of the DSA, direct lost profits are the\nforeseeable consequence of Hospira\u2019s breach of its manufacturing obligations. 22 N.Y.3d 799,\n808-09 (N.Y. 2007).\n\nDefendants argue that Biotronik and other cases cited by Plaintiffs are distinguishable\nbecause they involved distribution agreements, as opposed to a supply agreement like the one at\nissue in this case. (11/30/2022 Tr.) But the crucial factor in Biotronik was the nature and\nbroader purpose of the agreement in its entirety. Biotronik, 22 N.Y.3d at 809. At this early stage\nof the proceedings, the court cannot conclude as a matter of law that Cilag\u2019s lost profits were not\na \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of the breach of the DSA, which requires Hospira to\nmanufacture ReoPro\u00ae in specified quantities for Cilag to sell. Cf id. at 804-05 (reversing trial\ncourt\u2019s summary judgment ruling that lost profits sought by plaintiff were consequential\ndamages subject to the contract\u2019s damages limitation provision). The exclusive nature of the\nDSA further supports the plausibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 position because Hospira\u2019s exclusive right to\n\nmanufacture ReoPro\u00ae placed Cilag in a position of having no product to sell following\nHospira\u2019s manufacturing failures. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at Ex. A, \u00a7 5.1); see Gardensensor, Inc. v.\nStanley Black & Decker, Inc.,2014 WL 4764628, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 24, 2014) (concluding\non summary judgment that lost profits were not barred by contractual limitation on liability\nwhere the agreement contained exclusivity rights on manufacturing).\n\nPlaintiffs also point to \u00a7 6.8 of the DSA, which expressly precludes the recovery of lost\nprofits in the event of a product recall: \u201cFor purposes of this Agreement, the expenses of the\nrecall shall include, but not be limited to, the expenses of notification and destruction or return of\nthe recalled Product, cost of the recalled Product, and any costs associated with the distribution\nof the replacement Product, but shall not include lost profits of either party.\u201d (DI. 1, Ex. B at\nEx. A, \u00a7 6.8) According to Plaintiffs, this provision confirms that the parties knew how to\nexpressly exclude the recovery of lost profits when that was their intent, and the omission of lost\nprofits from \u00a7 8.6 signifies that the parties did not intend to preclude recovery on that basis. (D.I.\n16 at 11) At this early stage of the proceedings, the court cannot conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019\ninterpretation is unreasonable as a matter of law. See VLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,\n840 A.2d 606, 615 (Del. 2003) (\u201cIn deciding a motion to dismiss, the trial court cannot choose\nbetween two differing reasonable interpretations of ambiguous provisions. Dismissal, pursuant\nto Rule 12(b)(6), is proper only if the defendants\u2019 interpretation is the only reasonable\nconstruction as a matter of law.\u201d).\n\nDefendants cite a number of cases in support of their position that Plaintiffs\u2019 lost profits\ncannot plausibly be characterized as direct damages under the terms of the DSA. Most of these\ncases arose in the context of a motion for summary judgment, see In re ADI Liquidation, Inc.,\n555 B.R. 423 (Bankr. D. Del. 2016); First Niagara Bank N.A. v. Mortg. Builder Software, Inc.,\n\n2016 WL 2962817 (W.D.N.Y. May 22, 2016), or post-trial findings of fact and conclusions of\nlaw, see eCommerce, 2013 WL 5621678, at *1; VICI Racing, LLC v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 87 F.\nSupp. 3d 697 (D. Del. 2015). The procedural posture of these cases supports Plaintiffs\u2019 position\nthat a dispositive determination on this issue should not be reached until after discovery has\nconcluded. See CrewFacilities.com, 2021 WL 2649758, at *3 (declining to dismiss the\ncomplaint\u2019s direct damages claim based on a limited liability clause in the underlying contract).\n\nTwo non-precedential cases cited by Defendants are distinguishable on their facts and are\ntherefore not persuasive for the cited proposition. In Strassle v. Bimbo Foods Bakeries\nDistribution, Inc., the court agreed with the defendant that the distinction between direct and\nconsequential lost profits was \u201cnot applicable in the present context\u201d because the contract was\ngoverned by the New Jersey Uniform Commercial Code. 2013 WL 1007289, at *5-6 (D.N.J.\nMar. 12, 2013). Moreover, the court found that in the U.C.C. context, lost profits fall within the\nexclusive province of consequential rather than direct damages. Id. Likewise, in No Spill, Inc. v.\nScepter Canada, Inc., the court applied Kansas case law and the Uniform Commercial Code to\nfind that the plaintiff's alleged lost resale profits from third parties were consequential damages\nthat were barred under the supply agreement\u2019s limitation of liability provision. 429 F. Supp. 3d\nat 783.\n\nFor these reasons, I recommend that the court deny Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\nPlaintiffs\u2019 damages claim for lost profits.\n\nB. Standing to Enforce the DSA\n\nDefendants argue that the court should dismiss Counts II and IV of the complaint, which\nassert causes of action against Janssen Biotech for breach of contract and breach of the implied\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, respectively, because Janssen Biotech lacks standing.\n\n(DL. 14 at 13) Specifically, Defendants maintain that Janssen Biotech is neither a party to the\nDSA and QTA, nor a third-party beneficiary of those agreements. (/d. at 13-17)\n\nPlaintiffs initially alleged that Janssen Biotech is a party to the DSA due to its status as an\nAffiliate of Cilag, but they appeared to abandon this position during oral argument. (D.I. 16 at\n15; 11/30/2022 Tr.) The court concludes that Janssen Biotech is not a party to the DSA or the\nQTA. \u201cAs a general matter, only a party to a contract has standing to enforce a contract and sue\nfor breach of that contract.\u201d Rottlund Homes of N.J., Inc. v. Saul, Ewing, Remick & Saul, L.L.P.,\n243 F. Supp. 2d 145, 153 (D. Del. 2003); Micro Focus (US), Ine. v. Ins. Servs. Off., Inc., C.A.\nNo. 15-252-RGA, 2022 WL 1503918 (D. Del. May 12, 2022). The record before the court\nconfirms that the parties to the DSA are Cilag GmbH International and Hospira Worldwide, Inc.,\n(D.I. 1, Ex. B at Ex. A), and the parties to the QTA are Hospira, Inc. and Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, (id., Ex. B at Ex. B). Janssen Biotech is not included among these parties.\n\nPlaintiffs maintain that Janssen Biotech nonetheless has third-party beneficiary status\nunder the DSA. (D.I. 16 at 16-19) To determine whether an entity is a third-party beneficiary,\nthe court must consider the intent of the parties who entered into the contract, i.e., \u201c(a) the\ncontracting parties must have intended that the third party beneficiary benefit from the contract,\n(b) the benefit must have been intended as a gift or in satisfaction of a pre-existing obligation to\nthat person, and (c) the intent to benefit the third party must be a material part of the parties\u2019\npurpose in entering into the contract.\u201d In re Stone & Webster, Inc., 558 F.3d 234, 241 (3d Cir.\n2009). Plaintiffs have not pled facts showing that both parties to the contract intended Janssen\nBiotech to be a third-party beneficiary under the first prong of this conjunctive inquiry. See\nMicro Focus, 2022 WL 1503918, at *2 (stating that the plaintiff \u201cmust show that both parties to\n\nthe contract intended for [the alleged third-party beneficiary] to be a third-party beneficiary.\u201d).\n\n10\nThe complaint alleges that the parties to the DSA intended Janssen Biotech to be a third-\nparty beneficiary because Janssen Biotech qualifies as an \u201cAffiliate\u201d of Cilag under the DSA.\n(D.L 1, Ex. B at {17) The parties do not meaningfully dispute that Janssen Biotech is an\n\u201cAffiliate\u201d under the DSA, and Plaintiffs\u2019 answering brief reiterates that this Affiliate status is\nsufficient to confirm the parties\u2019 intention to benefit Janssen Biotech. (D.I. 16 at 16) But\nJanssen Biotech\u2019s status as an Affiliate under the DSA is not enough, by itself, to establish the\nparties\u2019 intent to benefit it. See Eastman Chem. Co. v. AlphaPet Inc., C.A. No. 09-971-LPS-\nCJB, 2011 WL 6004079, at *6 (D. Del. Nov. 4, 2011) (\u201c[I]f mere Affiliate status .. . was\nsufficient to transform a non-party into a third-party beneficiary of the agreement, then numerous\nother companies . . . would all likewise be deemed third-party beneficiaries\u201d of the contract).\nPlaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to show that both Hospira and Cilag intended to confer\nthird-party beneficiary status on Janssen Biotech. See Micro Focus, 2022 WL 1503918, at *2.\nConsequently, I recommend that the court dismiss Counts II and IV of the complaint due to\nJanssen Biotech\u2019s lack of standing.\n\nC. Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action for breach of the implied covenant at\nCounts III and IV of the complaint should be dismissed because they are duplicative of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claims and assert only conclusory allegations of bad faith. (D.I. 14\nat 18-19) Defendants suggest Plaintiffs are attempting to evade the DSA\u2019s waiver of\nconsequential lost profits damages by asserting these causes of action for breach of the implied\ncovenant. (Id. at 20)\n\nPlaintiffs respond that Counts III and IV are not duplicative because the claims seek relief\n\nfor Defendants\u2019 breach of their implied obligation to provide a continuous and reliable supply of\n\n11\n\nReoPro\u00ae to meet worldwide market demand. (D.I. 16 at 19) According to Plaintiffs, the\ndestruction of ReoPro\u00ae as a viable product goes beyond Hospira\u2019s failure to manufacture under\nthe DSA. Ud.)\n\nThe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \u201crequires a party in a contractual\nrelationship to refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable conduct which has the effect of preventing\nthe other party to the contract from receiving the fruits of the bargain.\u201d Nemec v. Shrader, 991\nA.2d 1120, 1128 (Del. 2010) (internal quotations omitted). To plead a claim for breach of the\nimplied covenant, \u201ca litigant must allege a specific obligation implied in the contract, a breach of\nthat obligation, and resulting damages.\u201d Fortis Advisors LLC vy. Dialog Semiconductor PLC,\n2015 WL 401371, at *3 (Del. Ch. Jan. 30, 2015). When the contract addresses the conduct at\nissue, breach of the implied covenant cannot be invoked. Phunware, Inc. v. Excelmind Grp. Ltd.,\n117 F. Supp. 3d 613, 628 (D. Del. 2015). \u201cThe doctrine thus operates only in that narrow band\nof cases where the contract as a whole speaks sufficiently to suggest an obligation and point to a\nresult, but does not speak directly enough to provide an explicit answer. In the Venn diagram of\ncontract cases, the area of overlap is quite small.\u201d Airborne Health, Inc. v. Squid Soap, LP, 984\nA.2d 126, 146 (Del. Ch. 2009). A contract term may only be implied \u201cwhen the party asserting\nthe implied covenant proves that the other party has acted arbitrarily or unreasonably, thereby\nfrustrating the fruits of the bargain that the asserting party reasonably expected.\u201d Nemec, 991\nA.2d at 1126.\n\nI recommend that the court dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action for breach of the implied\ncovenant because the claims \u201cdo[ ] nothing more than duplicate the conduct alleged in the breach\nof contract claim[s].\u201d Zinetti v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., C.A. No. 19-1279-LPS-JLH, 2020\n\nWL 409725, at *10 (D. Del. Jan. 24, 2020). The allegations are rooted in contractual obligations\n\n12\nexplicitly covered in the DSA and/or QTA, such as Defendants\u2019 obligation that the Hospira\nFacility was to serve as the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of ReoPro\u00ae meeting specified\nquality requirements and production amounts. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at {{] 77, 82) The pleading alleges\nthat Defendants\u2019 express obligations under the DSA and QTA presuppose Defendants\u2019 actual\nperformance of those obligations, and Defendants should therefore be liable for damages caused\nby their nonperformance, which led to the destruction of the worldwide ReoPro\u00ae market. (Id.)\nBut the remedies for Defendants\u2019 failure to perform their express contractual obligations are\ncovered by the DSA and QTA. Plaintiffs now argue these remedies are not sufficient to\ncompensate for the magnitude of Defendants\u2019 breaches, but the court may not \u201crewrite the\ncontract to appease a party\u201d who later believes the contract was a bad deal. Nemec, 991 A.2d at\n1126.\n\nThe implied covenant claims are also deficient because they allege in a conclusory\nmanner that \u201cHospira acted unreasonably so as to frustrate the fruits of the bargain that Cilag\nreasonably expected, by acting in bad faith so as to deprive Cilag of the benefit of its bargain.\u201d\n(D.I. 1, Ex. B at 776) But \u201c[g]eneral allegations of bad faith conduct are not sufficient.\u201d\nKuroda v. SPJS Holdings, L.L.C., 971 A.2d 872, 888 (Del. Ch. 2009). The complaint confirms\nthat Hospira shut down production for an unspecified length of time to conduct remediation\nefforts required by the FDA, impairing Hospira\u2019s ability to produce sufficient amounts of\nReoPro\u00ae. (D.I. 1, Ex. B at \u00a745) The complaint does not allege that quality issues in Hospira\u2019s\nmanufacturing process were the result of intentional actions. These allegations do not support an\ninference that Defendants refused to produce conforming quantities of ReoPro\u00ae arbitrarily or in\nbad faith. Instead, it shows that Defendants\u2019 alleged quality control failures prevented them from\n\nsatisfying the terms of the contracts, and they undertook remediation measures required by the\n\n13\nFDA. See Airborne Health, 984 A.2d at 147 (finding that failure to expend marketing resources\nto achieve financial targets was not done in bad faith where company had suffered corporate\ncrisis precluding those expenditures). For these reasons, I recommend that the court dismiss\nPlaintiffs\u2019 causes of action for breach of the implied covenant at Counts III and IV of the\ncomplaint.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-PART Defendants\u2019\npartial motion to dismiss; dismiss Counts II, II, and IV of the complaint without prejudice; and\nallow Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend the complaint within 10 days of the expiration of the\ndeadline for objections under Rule 72(b), or in accordance with a ruling from the court on\nobjections, if any. (D.L. 13)\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to ten (10)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage v. Barnhart, 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1\n(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: December 6, 2022\n\nherry R.
