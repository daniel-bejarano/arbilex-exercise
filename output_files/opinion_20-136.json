The parties submitted a Joint Claim Construction Brief (D.I. \n52) and I heard oral argument on October 19, 2021. (D.I. 59). \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe '145 patent relates to circuitry for camera modules used in digital cameras, including \nthose incorporated into mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. (See '145 patent, 1 :5-39; D.I. 52 at \n2). Plaintiff asserts only claim 1 of the '145 patent. (D.I. 22 at ,r 21; D.I. 59 at 65 :6-10). Claim \n1 recites: \nA camera module comprising: \nan_rmage sensor array:. \na gain amplifier ; \nan indicator set to indicate whether a first flash device or a second flash \ndevice is present; and \na plurality of storage locations; \nwherein the plurality of storage locations is configured to store an exposure \ntime and a gain, wherein the exposure time and the gain are associated with \nthe first flash device in response to the indicator indicating the presence of \nthe first flash device, wherein the exposure time and the gain are associated \nwith the second flash device in response to the indicator indicating the \npresence of the second flash device, wherein the image sensor array is \nconfigured to capture an image using the exposure time, and wherein the \ngain amplifier is configured to perform processing on the image using the \ngain. \n(' 145 patent, claim 1 ). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) ( en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted). '\" [T]here is no magic formula or \ncatechism for conducting claim construction. ' Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate \n1 weight to appropriate sources 'in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\"' \nSoftView LLC v. Apple Inc., 2013 WL 4758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (quoting Phillips, \n415 F.3d at 1324) (alteration in original). When construing patent claims, a court considers the \nliteral language of the claim, the patent specification , and the prosecution history. Markman v. \nWestview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 977-80 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 \n(1996). Of these sources, \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction \nanalysis. Usually, it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term. \" \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"(T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning .... \n[Which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in \nquestion at the time of the invention , i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application .\" \nId. at 1312-13 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he ordinary meaning of a \nclaim term is its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\" Id. at 13 21 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \"In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as \nunderstood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim \nconstruction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted \nmeaning of commonl y understood words.\" Id. at 1314. \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evidence-the patent claims, the \nspecification , and the prosecution history-the court's construction is a determination of law. \nSee Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318,331 (2015). The court may also make \nfactual findings based upon consideration of extrinsic evidence, which \"consists of all evidence \nexternal to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, \ndictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317-19 (internal quotation marks \n2 omitted). Extrinsic evidence may assist the court in understanding the underlying technology , \nthe meaning of terms to one skilled in the art, and how the invention works. Id. Extrinsic \nevidence , however, is less reliable and less useful in claim construction than the patent and its \nprosecution history. Id. \nIII. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS \n1. \"an indicator set to indicate whether a first flash device or a second flash device \nis present\" \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: no construction necessary \nb. Defendant 's proposed construction: \"a stored value identifying1 whether a first or \nsecond flash device is attached to a camera module\" \nc. Court's construction: plain and ordinary meaning \nDefendant proposes replacing \"an indicator set to indicate\" with \"a stored value \nidentifying.\" In support of this construction , Defendant points to language in the specification \nproviding, \"Register 200 is configured to store a flash enable/flash type indicator .\" ('145 patent, \n3:2-3). Defendant 's argument is that a \"stored value\" would be what is stored in Register 200 \nin order to indicate what is present. The specification language , however , describes a non-\nlimiting embodiment. (Id., 2:13-14; 2:24-26). As Plaintiff asserted at the Markman hearing, the \nclaimed \"indicator\" could also encompass a control circuit sending signals, or \ninstructions/firmware executed by a processor. (D.I. 59 at 43: 10-20 ( citing '145 patent, 2:57-58, \n3:33-36)) . Thus, Defendant 's construction improperly limits the claim scope to the disclosed \nembodiment. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1323. \nDefendant argues that the claimed \"indicator \" is distinct from the \"flash signal\" that turns \non the flash device. (D.I. 52 at 24). It reasons that dependent claim 6 recites \"the control circuit \n1 Defendant would be amenable to \"indicating\" rather than \"identifying. \" (D.I. 52 at 22 & n.3). \n3 is configured to provide the flash signal to the [first/second] flash device in response to the \nindicator indicating the presence of the [first/second] flash device.\" Defendant contends that \nsince the flash signal is provided in response to the indicator , it cannot be the indicator itself. \n(D.I. 52 at 24). I am not sure why this analysis would require construing \"indicator \" as a \"stored \nvalue.\" Instead, Defendant appears to be advancing its non-infringement position, which is more \nappropriatel y resolved at a later stage in the case. (See D.I. 22 at 1 13 (alleging that the \n\"STROBE \" flash signal in the accused product is an \"indicator \")). \nGiven the claim construction principle counseling against adding negative limitations to \nconstructions absent sufficient basis in the patent specification , I will decline to add the negative \nlimitation that the indicator is not a flash signal. See Omega Eng'g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 \nF.3d 1314, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (declining to add a negative limitation when there was no \n\"express disclaimer or independent lexicograph y in the written description that would justify \nadding that negative limitation \"). If at the time of summary judgment , there appears to be a \ngenuine claim construction dispute, I will consider further construction. \nBased on some of Plaintiff's arguments at the Markman hearing, I do want to clarify that \nthe plain meaning of \"set to indicate\" is not \"configured to indicate\" or \"capable of indicating. \" \nClaim 1 uses both \"set to\" and \"configured to.\" For example, claim 1 recites \"the plurality of \nstorage locations is configured to store an exposure time and gain,\" \"the image sensor array is \nconfigured to capture an image,\" and \"the gain amplifier is configured to perform processing on \nthe image.\" As Plaintiff points out, \"configured to\" goes to the capability of the plurality of \nstorage locations , the image sensor array, and the gain amplifier. (See D.I. 52 at 34). The usage \nof the different terms \"set to\" and \"configured to\" indicates that the patentee intended a different \nmeaning for \"set to\" than for \"configured to.\" See Amgen Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 923 F.3d 1023, \n4 1031 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"[D]ifferent claim terms are presumed to have different meanings. \" \n(quoting Helmsderf er v. Bobrick Washroom Equip., Inc., 527 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2008))). \n\"Set to indicate\" requires something more than mere future capability ; this term relates to the \npresent condition of the indicator. \nDefendant also argues that \"is present\" should be construed as \"is attached\" based on a \nstatement made by the examiner in the notice of allowability. (D.I. 52 at 23). This construction \nis merely an attempt to substitute Defendant 's word for the patentee's word. Simply because the \nexaminer used a different word is not a good reason to make such a substitution. The plain \nmeaning of \"present\" is broader than \"attached. \" In the context of the invention , it may also be \nbroader. It does not appear that the patentee gave the word \"present\" any special meaning, and I \nsee no reason to believe that the jury will have any difficulty understanding and applying the \nword. \n2. \"store an exposure time and a gain\" \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: no construction necessary \nb. Defendant 's proposed construction: \"record values representing exposure time \nand gain\" \nc. Court's construction: plain and ordinary meaning \nDefendant argues that \"store\" means \"record values.\" (D.I. 52 at 35-36). I see no basis in \nthe '145 patent that supports this substitution. The patentee did not act as its own lexicographer \nwith respect to this term, nor has there been a clear and unambiguous disavowal of claim scope. \nThis term does not need additional construction beyond what the claim already provides. The \nmeaning of this term in the context of the claim is clear and readily understandable to the jury. \nThus, I apply the plain and ordinary meaning, which is, as always, the default in claim \nconstruction. Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \n5 3. \"the exposure time and the gain are associated with the [first/second] flash \ndevice\" \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: no construction necessary \nb. Defendant 's proposed construction: \"the exposure time and gain parameters are \ncalculated differentl y depending on the type of flash device\" \nc. Court's construction: plain and ordinary meaning \nDefendant argues that \"associated with\" means \"calculated differently. \" (D.I. 52 at 41-\n44). In support ofthis construction, Defendant points to language in the specification stating, \n\"As described in FIGS. 5-10 below, host 110 calculates these parameters differentl y depending \non the type of flash device and the operation of image sensor array 128. Accordingly, the \nparameters are associated with the type of flash device and the operation of image sensor array \n128.\" ('145 patent, 5:13-18). \nDefendant contends that the patentee acted as its own lexicographer to define the \nmeaning of \"associate d with.\" (D.I. 52 at 42). I do not think this language rises to the level of \nlexicography. As the Federal Circuit instructs, \"It is not enough for a patentee to simply disclose \na single embodiment ... the patentee must clearly express an intent to redefine the term.\" MID \nProds. Inc. v. Iancu, 933 F.3d 1336, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (cleaned up). The patentee has not \nclearly expressed an intent to redefine \"associate d with.\" Instead, the patentee is providing an \nexample of how exposure time and gain may be associated with a first/second flash device. \nThe plain meaning of \"associated with\" is broader than \"calculated differentl y.\" It \nimplies a relationship or connection. There is no clear and unambiguous disavowal of claim \nscope in the specification or prosecution history. I therefore decline to adopt Defendant 's \nproposed construction and apply the plain and ordinary meaning. \n6 4. \"in response to the indicator indicating the presence of the [first/second] flash \ndevice\" \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: no construction necessary \nb. Defendants ' proposed construction : \"the indicator indicating the presence of a \nfirst/second flash device causes\" \nc. Court's construction: plain and ordinary meaning \nDefendant's proposed construction merely rephrases the plain language of the claim by \nreordering the claim terms and substituting synonyms. This does not present a genuine claim \nconstruction dispute, and I do not think this construction is necessary to clarify the plain meaning \nof the claim for the jury. See C.R. Bard, Inc. v. US. Surgical Corp., 388 F.3d 858, 863 (Fed. Cir. \n2004). The meaning of this term in the context of the claim is clear and readily understandable \nto the jury. Thus, I apply the plain and ordinary meaning. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nWithin five days the parties shall submit a proposed order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion suitable for submission to the jury. \n7 "}
