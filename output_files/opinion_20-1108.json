Catherine Baker and her neighbors are among them . They are not sick now \nbut worry that they might be later.  Fearing an increased risk of disease is  under-\nstandable , but it is a legal injury in only a few states. Because Delaware  is not one of \nthem , I must dismiss Baker\u2019s claims.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nCroda Inc. owns a Delaware chemical plant that uses ethylene oxide, a known \ncarcinogen. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  6, 33. In 2018, Croda \u2019s plant  leaked  thousands of pounds of \nethylene oxide into the surrounding  neighborhood . Id. \u00b6 37. Although Croda reacted \nquickly, residents worried that they had inhaled the chemical and now fear they will \nget cancer. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 37, 49.  \nOne resident, Baker, brought a class action on behalf of her neighbors, alleging \nstrict liab ility, public and private nuisance, negligence, willful and wanton conduct, \nand medical monitoring. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 62, 73 \u2013123. She admits that no neighbor  \u201cha[s] been \ncurrently diagnosed with cancer or illness  \u2026 of the kind caused by [ethylene oxide].\u201d \nId. \u00b6  63. B ut she says they all suffer \u201ca [n] increased risk of illness.\u201d Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 80, 89, 102, \n117; accord  id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 121. \nNow Croda moves to dismiss these  claims. It says that the mere risk of disease  \nalone  is not a compensable tort injury. D.I. 32, at 3 . I agree. Delaware law applies \nhere, and it does not recognize this claimed injury.  Because this problem disposes of  \nall the tort claims brought by this class, I dismiss them  with out prejudice.  3 II. DELAWARE LAW APPLIES  \nBefore addressing the merits, I must decide whether Delaware or New Jersey law \napplies .  \nWhy does this matter? New Jersey law recognizes independent  claims for medical \nmonitoring where Delaware law may not . D.I. 32, at 4. Compare M.G. ex. rel. K.G. v. \nA.I. Dupont Hosp. for Children , 393 F. App\u2019x 884, 892  (3d Cir. 2010), with Sinclair v. \nMerck & Co. , 948 A.2d 587, 591  (N.J. 2008). And New Jersey might have a different \nview of claims for increased risk of disease. Compare Sinclair, 948 A.2d  at 592 (notin g \nthat plaintiffs can recover for increased risk if they are \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to de-\nvelop a disease) , with United States v. Anderson, 669 A.2d 73, 78 (Del. 1995) (suggest-\ning the opposite in dicta) .  \nSince I sit in Delaware, I will rely o n its choice -of-law rules to decide this issue. In \ndoing so, I ask which state has the  \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d to the tort. Pa. \nEmp. , Benefit T r. Fund v. Zeneca, Inc. , 710 F. Supp. 2d 458, 467 (D. Del. 2010). Here, \nthat is Delaware. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. v. Patterson , 7 A.3d 454, 457 \u201358 \n(Del. 2010).  A corporation incorporated in Delaware and operating a chemical plant \nin Delaware leaked chemicals into a Delaware neighborhood.  \nBaker\u2019s objections do not convince . Because Croda\u2019s  headquarters  are in New Jer-\nsey, she says,  \u201c[i]t is entirely reasonable to infer that [Croda] \u2026 made the decisions\u201d \nabout using ethylene oxide \u201cfrom New Jersey.\u201d D.I. 37, at 5. Even so, Delaware has a \nfar closer link to these claims . Baker tries to delay this ruling  by asking for discovery. \nShe notes that in complex cases, courts sometimes delay choosing the applicable law \nuntil the record is more developed. D.I. 37, at 4 \u20135; see, e.g. , Ar\u00e7elik A.\u015e v. E.I. du Pont 4 de Nemours & Co. , 2018 WL 1401327, at * 8\u20139 (D. Del. Mar. 20, 2018) (delaying a \nruling  in a case involving international companies and worldwide injuries). This is \nnot such a complex case. So I will not delay  ruling that Delaware law applies .  \nIII. INCREASED RISK IS NOT AN INJURY  \nOn to the merits . At this stage, I take all of Baker\u2019s factual assertions as true and \nask if they state a  plausible claim. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 556 \n(2007). All tort claims require an injury. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 7 (1965). But \nin Delaware , Croda  argues , an increased risk of illness, without more, does not suf-\nfice. D.I. 32, at 8.  \nTrue, Delaware has not explicitly held that \u2014most cases Croda cites reject the re-\nlated but distinct claim for fear of disease. See Brzoska v. Olson , 668 A.2d 135 5, 1362 \n(Del. 1995)  (\u201c[D]amages for claims of emotional distress or mental anguish \u2026 are \nrecoverable only if [an]  underlying physical injury is shown.\u201d) ; Mergenthaler v. Asbes-\ntos Corp. of Am. , 480 A.2d 647, 6 51 (Del. 1984)  (\u201cIn any claim for mental anguish , \u2026 \nan esse ntial element of the claim is that the claimant have a present physical injury .\u201d \n(emphasis added) ). But to hold otherwise here would fly in the face of clear signals in \nDelaware tort law . \nFor one, the Delaware Supreme Court has said as much in dicta. In Anderson , \nthat court held that plaintiffs bringing medical malpractice claims could recover for \nincreased risk  when that risk  was tied to a physical injury . 669 A.2d at 78. By con-\ntrast, no one can recover by  \u201cclaiming that exposure to toxic substances  \u2026 ha s created \nan increased risk of harm not yet manifested in a physical disease. \u201d Id. at 77.  5 Plus, Delaware tort law presupposes that plaintiffs will bring suits after they suf-\nfer physical symptoms, not before. For one, Delaware lets toxic tort plaintiffs br ing \nseparate claims for different diseases caused by one exposure. See Sheppard v. A.C. \n& S. Co. , 498 A.2d 1126, 1134 (Del. Super. Ct. 1985), aff\u2019d sub nom. Keene Corp. v. \nSheppard , 503 A.2d 192 (Del. 1986). And states that do so generally allow recovery \nonly for manifested disease. 1 Toxic Torts Litig. Guide \u00a7 4:12 (2020); see, e.g. , Ander-\nson v. W.R. Grace & Co. , 628 F. Supp. 1219, 1231 (D. Mass. 1986). Plus, the statute \nof limitations for toxic -tort claims starts to run when a plaintiff begins to feel phy sical \neffects, suggesting that they are needed in every toxic -tort case. Brown v. E.I. duPont \nde Nemours & Co., Inc. , 820 A.2d 362, 368 (Del. 2003). So this putative class cannot \nrecover damages for increased risk.  \nBaker counters that recovery for increase d risk is allowed by several states that, \nlike Delaware, rely on the Second Restatement of Torts . See D.I. 37, at 11 \u201314. This is \nnot enough. Most courts reject increased- risk claims . See 1 Toxic Torts Litig. Guide \n\u00a7 4:12 (2020). Understandably so. \u201c[T]ens o f millions of individuals may have suffered \nexposure to substances \u201d that might never result in harm . Metro -North Commuter R. \nCo. v. Buckley , 521 U.S. 424, 442 (1997). Allowing lawsuits  for any risk of illness \nwould open the floodgates to \u201climitless and endless\u201d litigation. Rainer v. Union Car-\nbide Corp., 402 F.3d 608, 621 (6th Cir. 2005)  (internal quotation marks omitted) . \nWithout a contrary directive from the Delaware Supreme Court, I w ill not open those  \nflood gates here.  6 So this class cannot recover damages for the risk of diseases that they do not yet \nhave . And because each tort requires an injury, none of Baker\u2019s torts survive s this \nflaw.  \n* * * * * \nThe class cannot show it has suffer ed any injury under Delaware law, so I dismiss \nall its claims with out prejudice.  Baker may amend to show that the class has suffered \nphysical injury.  \nBut I will not certify this question to the Delaware Supreme Court. Del. R. Sup. \nCt. 41. Delaware law alr eady points to my holding today, so certification would not \nbe efficient. See Deutscher Tennis Bund v. ATP Tour, Inc. , 2013 WL 4478033, at *1 \nn.1 (D. Del. Aug. 20, 2013).   \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nCATHERINE BAKER , individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated  \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n C\nRODA INC. \n \nDefendant .
