No. 21-884-LPS \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nHaving reviewed the papers submitted in connection with Defendants' motion to \nwithdraw the reference (D.I. 1, 5) ( \"Motion to Withdraw\"), filed with respect to the above\u00ad\ncaptioned adversary proceeding (\"Insurance Action\"),1 and the opposition thereto (D.I. 4) filed \nby debtor 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide , Inc. (\"Plaintiff'); \n1 The docket of the Insurance Action, 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide, Inc., Adv. No. 20-51051-\nKBO, is cited herein as \"Adv. D.I. _.\" The docket of the chapter 11 cases, captioned In re 24 \nHour Fitness Worldwide , Inc. et al., No. 20-11558-KBO, is cited herein as \"B.D.I. .\" On \nMarch 16, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Final Decree (I) Closing the Affiliate Cases \nand (II) Granting Related Relief(B.D.I. 1782) closing all of the chapter 11 cases, with the \nexception of RS FIT NW LLC (Case No. 20-11568-KBO). IT IS ORDERED that the Motion to Withdraw (D.I. 1) is DENIED WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE , for the reasons that follow: \n1. Introduction. Plaintiff commenced the Insurance Action to obtain a declaration \nthat the policies purchased from Defendants provide coverage for certain of Plaintiff's losses \nrelated to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Defendants seek an order withdrawing the reference \nof the Insurance Action on the basis that it meets the criteria for permissive withdrawal for \n\"cause\" under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d). Defendants argue that the reference should be withdrawn \nbecause the Insurance Action is a non-core insurance coverage dispute that is completely \nuntethered to Plaintiff's confirmed and now-effecti ve plan ofreorganization . Plaintiff counters \nthat Defendants have failed demonstrate \"cause\" exists to withdraw the reference . The mere fact \nthat a complaint asserts non-core claims is not sufficient reason to withdraw the reference . A \nright to a jury trial coupled with a jury demand does not require withdrawal of the reference until \nthe case is ready to proceed to trial. Moreover , Plaintiff does not agree that Defendants are \nentitled to a jury trial on Plaintiff's single claim for declaratory judgment based on contract \ninterpretation. \n2. Background. The above-named Defendants issued insurance policies to Plaintiff, \nwhich provided coverage for the period from June 30, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (\"2019 \nPolicies\"), subject to certain terms, conditions , limitations , and exclusions . Additionally , \nDefendant Allied World National Assurance Company (\"Allied\") issued a separate policy \nproviding pollution coverage for the period from September 3, 2017 to September 3, 2020 \n(\"2017 Policy,\" and together with the 2019 Policies, the \"Policies\"), also subject to certain terms, \nconditions, limitations , and exclusions. \nOn March 16, 2020, Plaintiff and its affiliates closed all of their fitness club locations \nfollowing the issuance of \"stay at home\" and similar orders issued by various governmental \n2 authorities to combat the spread of COVID-19. (See Adv. D.I. 1 (\"Complaint\") at~ 40) On \nMarch 23, 2020, Plaintiff tendered claims to Defendants under the Policies, seeking payment for \nlosses following the closing of Plaintiffs fitness clubs. Thereafter, certain Defendants \ndetermined that the Policies did not provide coverage and issued denials of Plaintiffs claims for \ncoverage, while other Defendants issued reservations of rights concerning coverage . \nOn June 15, 2020, Plaintiff and its affiliates ( collectively, \"Reorganized Debtors\") each \ncommenced the above-captioned chapter 11 cases by filing voluntary petitions for relief under \nchapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On December 22, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed \nthe Reorganized Debtors' First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of 24 Hour \nFitness Worldwide, Inc. and its Affiliated Debtors. (B.D.I. 1478) (\"Plan\") The Plan \nencompasses a restructuring of the Reorganized Debtors, with creditors receiving either cash \nrecoveries or equity in the Reorganized Debtors as of the Plan's effective date. Plaintiffs causes \nof action, including the Insurance Action, were retained by the Reorganized Debtors. \nOn December 21, 2020, Plaintiff filed the Complaint commencing the Insurance Action. \nThe Complaint contains a single count seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to Plaintiff \nand Defendants' respective rights and obligations under the Policies, which Plaintiff alleges are \ngoverned by California law. Plaintiff argues that each of the Policies contains a provision stating \nthat each of the Defendants, respectively, must adhere to the insured's (Plaintiffs) choice of \nvenue and \"shall not transfer, change venue, or remove, or seek to transfer, change venue, or \nremove any lawsuit filed by the Insured in any such court.\" (Complaint at~ 16 (citing Master \nPolicy at~ 33)) Defendants have asserted affirmative defenses and have not consented to the \nBankruptcy Court's entry of final orders in the Insurance Action. Defendants have also \ndemanded a jury trial. \n3 The Plan's effective date occurred on December 29, 2020. On March 16, 2021, the \nBankruptcy Court entered a final decree (B.D.I. 1782) closing all of the Reorganized Debtors' \nchapter 11 cases, with the exception of Debtor RS FIT NW LLC. In the final decree, the \nBankruptcy Court specifically retained jurisdiction over the Insurance Action and stated that \n\"such adversary proceeding is unaffected by entry ofthis Final Decree.\" \nOn February 18, 2021, Defendants filed their Motion for Determination that Proceeding \nis Non-Core (Adv. D.I. 57), requesting a determination from the Bankruptcy Court that the \nInsurance Action is not a \"core\" proceeding within the meaning of28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b). Plaintiff \nfiled a response, acknowledging: \"Upon reflection , the Debtors believe that the [Insurance] \nAction may constitute a non-core proceeding . Accordingl y, subject to the Court's concurrence \nwith Defendants that this [Insurance] Action is non-core , the Debtors do not object to treatment \nof the [Insurance] Action as a 'non-core' matter.\" (Adv. D.I. 63 at 2) On March 19, 2021, the \nBankruptcy Court entered an Order (Adv. D.I. 68) determining that the Insurance Action \nconstitutes a non-core proceeding . \nIn accordance with a prior scheduling order entered in the Insurance Action (Adv. D.I. \n66), the parties had until April 29, 2022 to file a motion to withdraw the reference. Defendants \nfiled the Motion to Withdraw on June 21, 2021. In the meantime, on May 13, 2021, Defendant \nAllied filed its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings in the Bankruptcy Court (Adv. D.I. 75), \nand, following a hearing held on September 7, 2021 (Adv. D.I. 108) (\"9/7/21 Hearing\"), the \nBankruptcy Court issued an order (Adv. D.I. 106) denying the Motion for Judgment on the \nPleadings for the reasons stated on the record (see 9/7/21 Hearing at 35-41). \nThe docket of the Insurance Action reflects that the parties are currently engaged in \nextensive fact discovery . (Adv. D.I. 77-79, 94-103, 109, 113-14) On October 12, 2021, the \nBankruptcy Court approved an amended scheduling order (Adv. D.I. 111), pursuant to which \n4 fact discovery ends on March 25, 2022, expert discovery ends on June 30, 2022, and dispositive \nmotions must be filed no later than 3 0 days following the close of expert discovery ( currently \nJuly 14, 2022). \n3. Applicable standards. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(a), this Court refers all cases \narising under title 11 of the United States Code to the Bankruptcy Court. See Am. Standing \nOrder of Reference (dated February 29, 2012). The Court may withdraw the reference of a \nparticular case or proceeding \"on its own motion or on timely motion of any party, for cause \nshown.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d). \"For permissive withdrawal, '(t]he 'cause shown' requirement in \nsection 157(d) creates a presumption that Congress intended to have bankruptcy proceedings \nadjudicated in bankruptcy court unless rebutted by a contravening policy.'\" JLL Consultants , \nInc. v. Goldman Kurland & Mohidin, LLP (In re AgFeed USA, LLC), 565 B.R. 556, 561-62 (D. \nDel. 2016) (quoting Hatzel & Buehler, Inc. v. Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp., 106 B.R. 367, \n371 (D. Del. 1989)). \"To overcome that presumption , the moving party has the burden to prove \nthat cause exists to withdraw the reference.\" Id. at 562 (citing In re NDEP Corp., 203 B.R. 905, \n907 (D. Del. 1996)). As noted by the Third Circuit, \"'cause' to withdraw the reference \"will be \npresent in only a narrow set of circumstances.'\" Superior Contracting Group, Inc. v. Rachmale \n(In re LTC Holdings , Inc.), 2019 WL 4643801, at *4 (D. Del. Sept. 24, 2019) (citing In re Pruitt, \n910 F.2d 1160, 1171 (3d Cir. 1990)). \n4. Analysis. Defendants argue that withdrawing the reference now best serves \njudicial economy . The adversary proceeding involves only one claim, which the Bankruptc y \nCourt has determined to be a non-core claim on which it cannot enter a final order, and a jury \ntrial has been requested. Defendants argue that the Insurance Action was filed just prior to Plan \nconfirmation, and even if the Reorganized Debtor succeeds on the merits of the Insurance \n5 Action, any recoveries will flow only to the Reorganized Debtors -not to creditors or the \nbankruptcy estate -so there is no reason for the Bankruptc y Court to continue oversight. \nDefendants devote much of their argument to the fact that Plaintiffs claim is non-core. \nDefendants cite a New York case, Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Ctr. v. Arrowood Indem. \nCo., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94233 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2021), involving similar \ncircumstances. In that case, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville filed for bankruptcy to \ndeal with the \"financial repercussions \" of sexual abuse claims. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94233, at \n*4. On the same day the Diocese filed for bankruptc y relief, it also filed an adversary \nproceeding against its insurers, seeking a declaratory judgment outlining the parties' rights under \ncertain insurance policies, as well as asserting a breach of contract claim for the insurers' failure \nto defend or indemnify the Diocese on such claims. See id. The Rockville Court applied the so\u00ad\ncalled \"Orion factors\" -which largely mirror the Pruitt factors applied in this Circuit -to \ndetermine whether the reference to the bankruptc y court should be withdrawn. Concluding that \nit should, the court stated: \"The claims at issue in this matter are non-core. The Diocese's case \nagainst [the insurers] concerns who bears financial responsibility for certain tort claims; it does \nnot concern the validity of the underlying claims.\" Id. at * 11. The Rockville court found \ncompelling the fact that resolution of the matter required contract interpretation of pre-petition \ninsurance policies that existed independent of the bankruptc y. See id. at *11-12. \nThe Rockville decision, while instructive , essentiall y assumes that once it is determined \nthat a proceeding is non-core, withdrawal of the reference is almost always appropriate , because \nthe bankruptcy court cannot enter final orders on non-core matters or conduct a jury trial. See id. \nat *21 (\"Because the Bankruptcy Court lacks final adjudicative authority over these claims, were \nthe Court to deny [the withdrawal] motion, the Bankruptc y Court would be limited to submitting \nproposing findings of fact and conclusions of law for de novo review by a district court. In such \n6 circumstances, it is generally inefficient to allow the proceedings to go forward, knowing that \nthey will have to be substantially repeated.\") (internal quotations omitted). That view, while \nentirely reasonable, differs from this Court's general practice of withdrawing the reference at \nsuch time as the matter is ready for trial, so that the Bankruptcy Court, which is already familiar \nwith the parties and issues, may oversee discovery and pre-trial matters, and narrow the issues \nfor trial. This practice has promoted judicial economy in this Court and the undersigned Judge \nsees no reason to depart from it under the circumstances presented by the instant case. \nThe fact that Plaintiffs claim is non-core is not dispositive and does not alter the Court's \nconclusion. The \"mere fact\" that a complaint \"asserts non-core claims does not mandate \nwithdrawal.\" AgFeed USA, 565 B.R. at 564 (\"Proceedings should not be withdrawn for the sole \nreason that they are non-core.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn non-core proceedings, the bankruptcy court is given the power \nto submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the \ndistrict court. Indeed, permitting the Bankruptcy Court to oversee \npretrial matters ... , and withdrawing it only when it is ripe for a \njury trial, promotes judicial economy and a timely resolution of [a] \ncase. \nLTC Holdings, 2019 WL 4643801, at *5 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nSimilarly, although a right to a jury trial is one of the factors a court considers in \nweighing whether to withdraw the reference , it is not \"itself sufficient cause for discretionary \nwithdrawal.\" LTC Holdings , 2019 WL 4643801, at *6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even \nassuming Defendants have a right to a jury trial,2 this, too, would not be dispositive. As this and \n2 Plaintiff disputes that Defendants even have a right to a jury trial, contending the case turns on \ncontractual interpretation. (See D.I. 4 at 5); see also In re Ramex Intern., Inc., 91 B.R. 313,316 \n(E.D. Pa. 1988) (denying motion to withdraw reference where adversary proceeding for \ndeclaratory judgment seeking determination of coverage would not require jury trial, as \"[i]t is \nwell established that 'the interpretation of an insurance policy when the facts are not in dispute is \na question of law for the court\"') (quoting Contrans , Inc. v. Ryder Trust Rental, Inc., 836 F.2d \n163, 166 (3d Cir. 1987)). \n7 other courts have stated: '\"Even when a district court must ultimately preside over a trial by jury, \nthere is no reason why the Bankruptc y Court may not preside over an adversary proceeding and \nadjudicate discovery disputes and motions only until such time as the case is ready for trial.\"' \nLTC Holdings , 2019 WL 4643801, at *6 (quoting General Elec. Capital Corp. v. Teo, 2001 WL \n1715777, at *4 (D.N.J. Dec. 14, 2001)). In analyzing a motion to withdraw the reference based \non a jury demand, \"courts consider (1) whether the case is likely to reach trial; (2) whether \nprotracted discovery with court oversight will be required; and (3) whether the bankruptcy court \nis familiar with the issues presented. \" LTC Holdings, 2019 WL 4643801, at *6 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Where, as here, a case involves \"unresolved pre-trial matters, \nincluding discovery, one can only speculate when it will proceed to trial, if at all.\" Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Fact discovery is ongoing, expert discovery has not yet commenced , \nand the parties are not due to file dispositive motions until July 14, 2022. It is unclear whether -\nand, if so, when -this case will be ready to proceed to trial. \nApplication of the Pruitt factors further supports the Court's conclusion . In In re Pruitt, \nthe Third Circuit set out five factors to be considered when analyzing a motion to withdraw the \nreference for cause: \"(1) uniformity in bankruptc y administration , (2) reducing forum shopping \nand confusion, (3) fostering the economical use of the debtors' and creditors' resources , (4) \nexpediting the bankruptcy process, and (5) the timing of the request for withdrawal.\" AgFeed \nUSA, 565 B.R. at 563 (citing In re Pruitt, 910 F.2d at 1171). \nIn analyzing the first Pruitt factor, the fact that the Bankruptcy Court can only issue \nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law as to non-core matters \"does not ... \nundermine[] judicial uniformity.\" In re Liberty State Benefits of Delaware , Inc., 2015 WL \n1137591, at *3 (D. Del. March 12, 2015). As to the second factor-reducing forum shopping \nand confusion -Plaintiff relies on the policy provision requiring Defendants to adhere to \n8 Plaintiffs choice of venue. (See D.I. 4 at 7) Based on the current record, the Court is not \npersuaded that this factor weighs strongly for or against withdrawal, as Plaintiff has conceded the \nsole claim is a non-core claim on which the Bankruptc y Court cannot enter a final order and \nwithdrawal may be appropriate in the future. The third and fourth factors -fostering the \neconomical use of the debtors' and creditors' resources , and expediting the bankruptcy process -\nare mostly neutral with respect to withdrawing the reference at the present time, as the Plan has \nalready gone effective, but weigh slightly in favor of denial, as \"permitting the Bankruptcy Court \nto oversee pretrial matters ... , and withdrawing it only when it is ripe for a jury trial, promotes \njudicial economy and a timely resolution of [a] case.\" LTC Holdings , 2019 WL 4643801, at *5 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). For the same reasons, the fifth Pruitt factor (timing of the \nrequest for withdrawal) favors Plaintiff. Defendants filed the Motion to Withdraw at a time \nwhen it was (and now remains) speculative as to whether they have a right to a jury trial and \nwhether (and when) this case will go to trial. \"[T]here is no reason why the Bankruptcy Court \nmay not preside over [this case] and adjudicate discovery disputes and motions only until such \ntime as the case is ready for trial.\" LTC Holdings, 2019 WL 4643801, at *6 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \n5. Conclusion. For the reasons explained above, the Court will deny the Motion to \nWithdraw without prejudice. \nJanuary 4, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware \n9 Ho~tE&NikARK \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE "}
