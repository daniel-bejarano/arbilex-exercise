INTRODUCTION\nPresently before the court in this asbestos-related personal injury action are motions for\nsummary judgment filed by defendants Pneumo Abex LLC (\u201cPneumo\u201d) (D.I. 99), Goodyear Tire\n& Rubber Company (\u201cGoodyear\u201d) (D.I. 100), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop\nGrumman) (D.I. 102). Plaintiffs John T. Rhodes (\u201cMr. Rhodes\u201d) and Sonoko Rhodes (\u201cMs.\nRhodes\u201d) (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) did not respond to the motions.' For the reasons that follow,\nthe court recommends GRANTING each of the three defendants\u2019 motions for summary\njudgment.\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\n' Pneumo filed an opening brief in support of its motion for summary judgment on August 5,\n2021. (D.I. 99) Goodyear and Northrop Grumman filed opening briefs in support of their\nmotions for summary judgment on August 6, 2021. (D.I. 101; D.I. 103) Plaintiffs did not file\nanswering briefs, which were due on or before August 19 and 20, 2021.\na. Procedural History\n\nOn February 21, 2020, Plaintiffs originally filed this personal injury action against\nmultiple defendants, asserting claims arising from Mr. Rhodes\u2019 alleged harmful exposure to\nasbestos. (D.I. 1, Ex. A) On March 16, 2020, defendant United Technologies Corporation\nremoved the case to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1442(a)(1), the federal officer removal\nstatute,\u201d and 1446. (D.I. 1) On August 5, 2021, Pneumo filed the present motion for summary\njudgment, to which Plaintiffs did not respond. (D.I. 99) On August 6, 2021, Goodyear and\nNorthrop Grumman filed the present motions for summary judgment, to which Plaintiffs did not\nrespond. (D.I. 100; D.I. 102)\n\nb. Facts\n\nMr. Rhodes served in the Navy for approximately 22 years, from December, 1962 to\nJune, 1984. (D.I. 99, Ex. B at 13:1-3) After enlisting, Mr. Rhodes went to boot camp for three\nmonths in San Diego, California. (/d. at 13:4-10) In 1963, Mr. Rhodes was stationed in\nAlameda, California for approximately one year, where he worked as an E-2 and later E-3\nAirman Apprentice in the tire, whee] assembly, and brake shop. (Jd. at 13:11-24; D.I. 101, Ex. B\nat 132:22-25; D.I. 103, Ex. A at 208:3-4) From 1964 to 1968, Mr. Rhodes worked as an E-4 and\nlater E-5 Navy Aircraft Mechanic at the Naval Air Facility in Okinawa, Japan. (D.I. 103, Ex. B\nat 21:10-25; Ex. A at 207:22-208:7) Mr. Rhodes was next stationed at the air base in Atsugi,\nJapan from 1968 to 1971, during which time he worked for three months in the brake shop as a\nForeman, Second Class, E5, and thereafter worked on maintenance of stationed aircraft. (D.I.\n2 The federal officer removal statute permits removal of a state court action to federal court\nwhen, inter alia, such action is brought against \u201c[t]he United States or an agency thereof or any\nofficer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or of any agency thereof,\n\nsued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1442(a)(1).\n101, Ex. B at 164:15-165:1; D.I. 103, Ex. B at 35:18-20) In 1971, Mr. Rhodes worked as an E-6\nAircraft Mechanic and was assigned to the A-6 Intruder Squadron at Naval Air Station in\nWhidbey Island, Washington. (D.L. 103, Ex. A at 208:12-14, 297:25-298:24) He remained\nstationed there until he retired from the Navy in 1984. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiffs allege that Mr. Rhodes developed lung cancer and other asbestos-related\ndiseases as a result of his exposure to asbestos-containing materials, including those provided by\neach of the moving Defendants, during his service in the United States Navy while stationed at\nAlameda Naval Base, Treasure Island Naval Base, Okinawa Transient Line, Atsugi Naval Air\nStation, and Whidbey Island Naval Base, and while onboard the USS Kitty Hawk, USS America,\nand USS Lexington. (D.I. 1, Ex. A at ff 16-19) Accordingly, Plaintiffs assert claims for\nnegligence, willful and wanton conduct, strict liability, conspiracy, fraudulent, negligent, and\nintentional misrepresentation, loss of consortium, and punitive damages. (D.I. 1)\n\nMr. Rhodes was deposed on December | and 2, 2020. (D.I. 55; D.I. 56) Plaintiffs did\nnot produce any other product identification witnesses for deposition.\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\na. Summary Judgment\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those that could affect the outcome of the proceeding, and \u201ca\ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury\nto return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.\n2011) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely disputed\nmaterial fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to\ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial, and the court must view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith\n. Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458,\n460-61 (3d Cir. 1989); Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). Ifa party fails to address\nanother party\u2019s assertion of fact, the court may consider the fact undisputed, or grant summary\njudgment if the facts show that the movant is entitled to it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2)-(3). A\nplaintiff's failure to respond \u201cis not alone a sufficient basis for the entry of a summary\njudgment.\u201d Anchorage Assocs. v. Virgin Islands Bd. of Tax Review, 922 F.2d 168, 175 (3d Cir.\n1990). Even where a party does not file a responsive submission to oppose the motion, the court\nmust still find that the undisputed facts warrant judgment as a matter of law. See Miller v.\nAshcroft, 76 F. App\u2019x 457, 462 (3d Cir. 2003) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Lorenzo v. Griffith, 12\nF.3d 23, 28 (3d Cir. 1993)). In other words, the court must still determine whether the\nunopposed motion for summary judgment \u201chas been properly made and supported.\u201d Williams v.\nMurray, Inc., 2014 WL 3783878, at *2 (D.N.J. July 31, 2014) (quoting Muskett v. Certegy Check\nServs., Inc., 2010 WL 2710555, at *3 (D.N.J. July 6, 2010)).\n\nb. Washington Law\n\nThe parties agree that Washington law applies to the instant motions. (D.I. 94) A\nplaintiff in an asbestos case must establish a \u201creasonable connection between the injury, the\nproduct causing the injury, and the manufacturer of that product.\u201d Lockwood v. AC & S, Inc.,\n744 P.2d 605, 612 (Wash. 1987) (citing Martin v. Abbott Labs., 102 Wash. 2d 581, 590 (1984)).\n\nWashington law requires the plaintiff to establish that exposure to asbestos from a particular\nproduct was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the plaintiff's injuries. See Barabin v. Albany\nIntern. Corp., 2009 WL 2578967, at *5-6 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 18, 2009); Barabin v.\nAstenJohnson, Inc., 2010 WL 11613472, at *2-3 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 10, 2010). In determining\nsubstantial factor causation, courts consider:\n\n...the evidence of plaintiffs proximity to the asbestos product when the\n\nexposure occurred and the expanse of the work site where asbestos fibers\n\nwere released. They should also take into account the extent of time that the\n\nplaintiff was exposed to the product.... Courts should also consider the types\n\nof asbestos products to which the plaintiff was exposed and the ways in\n\nwhich such products were handled and used .... In addition, trial courts must\n\nconsider the evidence presented as to medical causation of the plaintiff's\n\nparticular disease.\nId. at 613. See also Estate of Brandes v. Brand Insulations, Inc., 2017 WL 325702, at *5 (Wash.\nCt. App. Jan. 23, 2017); Morgan v. Aurora Pump Co., 248 P.3d 1052, 1057 (Wash. 2011).\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\na. Pneumo Abex LLC\n\nThe court recommends granting Pneumo\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there\n\nis no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether a Pneumo product was a substantial\nfactor in causing Mr. Rhodes\u2019 injuries. Plaintiffs did not identify any asbestos-containing\nPneumo products or exposure to any Pneumo products. (D.I. 99, Ex. A-B) The lack of evidence\nin the record on product identification and nexus supports dismissal of the claims against\nPneumo as a matter of law.\n\nb. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company\n\nThe court recommends granting Goodyear\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there\n\nis no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether a Goodyear product was a substantial\n\nfactor in causing Mr. Rhodes\u2019 injuries. Evidence that a defendant supplied asbestos-containing\n\nproducts to a particular worksite, without additional evidence that the product to which the\nplaintiff was exposed contained asbestos, is insufficient to survive a motion for summary\njudgment. See In re Asbestos Litig., 2011 WL 676163, at *2 (Del. Super. Feb. 16, 2011)\n(applying Washington law); See also Hautala v. Cutler Hammer, Inc., 134 Wash. App. 1059, at\n*1-2 (Wash. Ct. App. 2006); See also In re Asbestos Litig. (James), 2011 WL 676163 (Del.\nSuper. Ct. Feb. 16, 2011) (applying Washington law and holding summary judgment appropriate\nwhere plaintiff offers no evidence relating to the use of asbestos-containing products shipped to\nplaintiffs worksite).\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims against Goodyear are limited to Mr. Rhodes\u2019 work with aircraft brakes\nduring his service in Alameda, California from 1963-1964. (D.I. 101, Ex. A at 13:11-18, 16:24-\n17:16, 26:15-17, 37:19-22, 49:13-17; Ex. B at 158:16-19, 164:11-165:11, 233:6-17) Mr. Rhodes\nrecalls breathing in dust created from cleaning and replacing the brake and tire assemblies. (/d.,\nEx. A at 16:5-10) He also recalls seeing the name \u201cGoodyear\u201d on the metal portion of the brake\nassemblies, but does not recall seeing the name \u201cGoodyear\u201d on the friction parts as those came in\nseparate kits with only part numbers listed. (/d., Ex. B at 134:21-135:18, 142:10-143:1, 176:3-\n11; 215:7-16) Mr. Rhodes testified that he did not remove brake assemblies from the aircraft and\nthus could not identify the specific aircrafts on which the Goodyear brake assemblies were used.\n(Cd. at 130:11-20, 131:7-15) Further, he could not identify the types of brake assemblies or\nwhether any of the brake assemblies contained asbestos. (/d. at 131:7-132:1, 136:16-137:2,\n231:4-25) Goodyear acknowledges that its former subsidiary, Goodyear Aerospace Corporation\n(\u201cGAC\u201d), manufactured aircraft brake linings during the time period relevant to the instant case.\n(d., Ex. C at 2, 5) However, GAC manufactured brake assemblies for only a portion of those\naircraft that Mr. Rhodes identified as being present at Alameda, and only some of those brake\n\nassemblies contained asbestos. (/d.)\nEven if the court were to find that Mr. Rhodes worked with asbestos-containing\nGoodyear brake assemblies, his exposure does not exceed a de minimis standard under\nWashington law. In Johansen v. Air & Liquid Sys. Corp., this court, applying Washington law,\nheld that repair work on five automobile brake systems over three decades of automotive work\nwas de minimis and granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. See Johansen v. Air\n& Liquid Sys. Corp., C.A. No. 17-452-MN-SRF, 2019 WL 330150, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 25, 2019).\nMr. Rhodes testified that Goodyear brake assemblies comprised about three to four percent of\nthose that he worked on while in Alameda. (D.I. 101, Ex. B at 229:5-21) (\u201cthe majority of [the\nbrake assemblies] were Bendix. I vaguely recollect working on some Goodyear, Cleveland, and\nBFGoodrich.\u201d) Moreover, he testified that his work on Goodyear brake assemblies consisted of\nonly four to five brake repairs in the span of one year, and each brake repair lasted no longer than\nthree hours. (Jd. at 215:1-6, 230:14-231:3) Such alleged exposure is insufficient to satisfy\nsubstantial factor causation under Washington law. Therefore, the court recommends granting\nGoodyear\u2019s motion for summary judgment.?\n\nc. Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019\n\nThe court recommends granting Northrop Grumman\u2019s motion for summary judgment\n\nbecause there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether a Northrop Grumman\n\nproduct was a substantial factor in causing Mr. Rhodes\u2019 injuries. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against\n\n3 The recommendation of the court that summary judgment should be granted due to the lack of\nsubstantial factor causation makes it unnecessary to address Goodyear\u2019s motion relating to\npunitive damages and misrepresentation. (D.I. 101 at 11-12)\n\n4 Northrop Grumman also argues that the court could grant summary judgment in its favor\nbecause it is immune from liability pursuant to the government contractor defense and related\nderivative sovereign immunity. (D.I. 103 at 9-21) As explained, infra, the court recommends\ngranting Northrop Grumman\u2019s motion on the grounds that Plaintiffs fail to establish a causal\nconnection between injury, product, and manufacturer of that product. See Lockwood, 744 P.2d\nat 612. Thus, the court need not analyze the other grounds for summary judgment.\nNorthrop Grumman relate to Mr. Rhodes\u2019 alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products from\nworking as an Aircraft Mechanic on HU-16, S-2, and A-6 Intruder Navy aircraft. (D.I. 103, Ex.\nB at 22:14-19, 36:5-24) Mr. Rhodes claims he repaired these aircraft that he attributes to\nNorthrop Grumman from 1964 until November of 1975, when he was promoted to \u201cChief\u201d and\nceased hands-on repairs. (/d., Ex. A at 275:16-276:18, 280:11-19, 285:5-287:17, 290:11-291:1,\n297:25-299:11) Mr. Rhodes could not state whether any of the parts of the aircraft on which he\nperformed maintenance, such as wheels, brakes, hydraulic cylinders or engines, were original to\nany of the three types of aircraft he identified. (D.I. 103, Ex. A at 277:1-278:24, 290:3-10,\n306:22-307:1) Mr. Rhodes did not identify any product allegedly attributable to Northrop\nGrumman which contained asbestos. (/d.) Moreover, other than identifying Bendix as the\nmanufacturer of all brake assemblies on A-6 Intruder aircraft, Mr. Rhodes was unable to identify\nthe manufacturer of any brake linings, gaskets, or friction parts on any of the brakes on Northrop\nGrumman aircraft. (D.I. 101, Ex. B at 175:9-176:11)\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Rhodes is precluded under Washington law from asserting claims that\nNorthrop Grumman should be liable for replacement parts manufactured and sold by unrelated\ncompanies. See Simonetta v. Viad Corp., 197 P.3d 127, 138 (Wash. 2008); See also Braaten v.\nSaberhagen Holdings, 198 P.3d 493, 504 (Wash. 2008) (holding that \u201ca manufacturer has no\nduty under common law products liability or negligence principles to warn of the dangers of\nexposure to asbestos in products it did not manufacture and for which the manufacturer was not\nin the chain of distribution\u201d). Accordingly, the court recommends granting Northrop\n\nGrumman\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court recommends GRANTING Pneumo, Goodyear, and\nNorthrop Grumman\u2019s unopposed motions for summary judgment.
