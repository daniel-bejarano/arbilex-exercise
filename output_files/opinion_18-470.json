HANSON PLLC,  \nMadison, Mississippi ; Peter S. Pearlman, C OHN, LIFLAND , PEARLMAN , HERRMAN , & \nKNOPF LLP,  Saddle Brook, New Jersey . \nCounsel for Plaintiffs . \n J. Cory Falgowski,  H. Carlton Hilson,  Kristin Bryance Metheny, Ronald W. \nFlowers, B\nURR  & FORMAN  LLP, Wilmington, Delaware.  \n \nCounsel for Defendant . \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nOctober 11, 2022  \n \n \nBIBAS, Circuit Judge , sitting by designation . \nA group of e mployees is su ing their  former employer, Defenders, Inc., under the \nFair Labor Standards Act.  They claim that Defenders did not pay them for all the \nhours that they worked. The lawsuit has dragged  on for more than four  years . Now 2 the parties are ready to settle for $5 million . Because the employees are getting a \ngood deal and the attorneys request reasonable fees,  I approve the settlement.  \nAn FLSA settlement should be approved if it is a \u201creasonable compromise over \nissues \u2026 that are actually in dispute.\u201d  Lynn\u2019s Food Stores, Inc. v. United States, 679 \nF.2d 1350, 1354 (11th  Cir. 1982).  So I ask whether  (1) the parties have a n actual  \ndispute , (2) the settlement does not frustrate the Act\u2019s purposes , and (3)  the \nsettlement , including the award of attorney fees,  is fair and reasonable.  E.g., Solkoff \nv. Pa. State Univ. , 435 F. Supp. 3d 646, 652, 654 \u201355 (E.D. Pa. 2020).  \nThis settlement resolves a n actual  dispute. The parties still contest the most basic \nfactual issues, including whether Defenders owes  overtime at all and whether  it \nshould calculate  pay at half -time  or time -and-a-half. D.I. 336 at 10\u201312 . And there is \nno hint  that these disputes are contrived.  \nNext, t he settlement does not frustrate the Act\u2019s purposes . Settlements usually \nfail this requirement when their confidentiality agreements and releases sweep too \nbroadly.  See Solkoff , 435 F. Supp. 3d at 658\u2013 60. Neither is a problem here. Though \nthe agreement limits c ounsel\u2019s ability to publicize the result, it does not so restrict \nthe employees. D.I. 336 -1 Ex. 1  \u00b6 8. So they can keep their employer s accountable by \ntelling others about the Act . And the employees release only wage -and-hour claims \nthat could have been brought in this lawsuit; they can still sue over unrelated harms or future wage -and-hour violations . D.I. 336 -1 Ex. 1 \u00b6 4. So Defenders has not bought \nits way out of accountability . I am thus satisfied that the agreement is consistent \nwith the Act\u2019s purposes.  3 Finally, the settlement is fair and reasonable. To decide that , I evaluate all  of the \ncircumstances, consulting the Girsh  class -action factors as appropriate.  Kraus v. PA \nFit II, LLC , 155 F. Supp. 3d 516, 523 n.3 (E.D. Pa. 2016).  \nThe collective is getting a good risk -adjusted recovery. Its members will share \n$1,504,000 pro rata  before enhancements . D.I. 336 -1 Ex. 1 \u00b6 5(a). This is roughly the \namount of unliquidated overtime damages they could get at trial if overtime  were  \nawarded a t time -and-a-half. D.I. 336 -1 \u00b6\u00b6  34\u201342. Liquidated damages under the \nFLSA match unliquidated damages, so the collective could hope for  at most  roughly \n$3 million . 29 U.S.C. \u00a7  216(b).  But if overtime were  calculated at half -time, they would \nget roughly $1 million after matching liquidated damages. D.I. 336- 1 \u00b6 34. And of \ncourse, there is a significant risk  that they could get nothing at all. D.I. 336 at 10 \u201311; \nD.I. 336 -1 \u00b6 43. So roughly $1.5  million  is a reasonable recovery on their primary \nclaim. Additional recovery on their other claims, including for breach of contract, is \nparticularly uncertain.  \nThe parties are in a good position to evaluate these risks: they are through  \ndiscovery and have litigated the case extensively. D.I. 336 at 2\u2013 4; D.I. 336 -1 \u00b6 54. And \nthe collective has reacted well to this settlement: counsel represents that more than  \n100 plaintiffs have responded positively  and none has  objected. D.I. 336 -1 \u00b6 51. \nAttorney fees  and expenses  are less straightforward . I was initially skeptical of a \nsettlement in which lawyers keep such a large share  of the recovery. D.I. 336 at  5. \nBut several factors persuade me that, under a lodestar analysis, this is fair.  See Davis \nv. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth. , 924 F.2d 51, 54  (3d Cir. 1991) (holding that \u201cit is not 4 permissible for a trial judge to make a reduction in  the attorney\u2019s fee award solely on \nthe basis of proportionality\u201d).  The attorneys billed at reasonable rates , and most \nhours were billed by associates and paralegals . D.I. 336 -1 \u00b6\u00b6  56, 62 ; D.I. 336 -3 \u00b6 6; \nD.I. 336 -4 \u00b6 5 ; D.I. 33 9 \u00b6 6 . Plaintiff s\u2019 counsel are not  solely responsible for the length \nof litigation : they faced laborious discovery, and Defenders  filed its share of motions \nand deposed a comparable number of witnesses. D.I. 336 at 2\u20134 ; D.I. 336 -1 \u00b6\u00b6 4\u2013 17, \n27\u201330, 54. I have reviewed counsel\u2019s billing record s in camera and am satisfied that \nthey are neither excessive nor redundant . See Evans v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J. , 273 \nF.3d 346, 362 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that  a district court  must \u201cgo line, by line, by \nline through the bi lling records supporting the fee request \u201d (internal quotation marks \nomitted) ). Enhancements are likewise reasonable and tailored to the inconvenience \nand reputational  risk borne by recipients. D.I. 336 at 13 \u201315; D.I. 336 -1 \u00b6 31(b); D.I. \n336-1 Ex. 1 \u00b6  5(a); cf. Kapolka v. Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, LLC , 2019 WL 5394751, \nat *13 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 2019) (surveying enhancements) . \nFinally, the lodestar multiplier is 0.65 , meaning that counsel will get  only 2/3 of \nwhat they  billed. D.I. 336 at 16 ; D.I. 336 -1 \u00b6\u00b6  60\u201361; D.I. 33 9 \u00b6 3 . So the effective \nhourly rate is $322.85, well in line with market rates for a mix of attorneys of similar \nexperience . D.I. 33 9 \u00b6 3 ; D.I. 336 -1 \u00b6 62; Rayna v. Campus Cmty. Sch. , 390 F. Supp. \n3d 556, 564 \u201367 (D. Del. 2019) . Though  counsel\u2019s recovery looks disproportionate , the \nlodestar analysis shows that the settlement is fair and reasonable. 5 * * * * * \nOrdinarily, lawyers should recover less than their clients. But sometimes, \nlitigation is too long and complicated for that to happen. This is one such occasion. \nAfter more than four  years and at great expense, the lawyers here have gotten a good \ndeal for t heir clients and seek reasonable compensation for that work. So I approve \nthe settlement.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nTEDDY ARCHER, et al. , \n \nPlaintiffs , \n \nv. \n DEFENDERS, INC. , \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:18-cv-00470-SB \n \n  ORDER  \nI GRANT  the motion for settlement approval  [D.I. 336] and DISMISS  THIS CASE  \nWITH PREJUDICE .
