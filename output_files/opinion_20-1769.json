(D.I. 42; D.I. 45)  For the \nreasons set forth below, the Court recommends that the motion to dismiss be GRANTED- IN-\nPART  and DENI ED-IN-PART , and the Court DENIES  the motion for jurisdictional discovery.   \nI. BACKGROUND \n \n \n1  Claude Blandin, Bruno Blandin, Patrick Blandin and Leoni will be referred to \nherein as the \u201cIndividual Defendants.\u201d  2 \n A. Factual Background  \n1. The Parties and Rel evant Non -parties  \nPlaintiff  is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania.  \n(D.I. 39 at \u00b6 1 )  Non -party ZNHC, Inc. (\u201cZNHC\u201d) was a Delaware corporation; it was Plaintiff\u2019s \nsubsidiary, and it later merged into Plaintiff and thus no longer exists as a s eparate entity.  ( Id. at \n\u00b6\u00b6 4, 38)  Non -party Schratter Foods, Inc. (\u201cSFI\u201d) is a Delaware corporation, which was \nheadquartered in Fairfield, New Jersey as of the time of certain relevant events  in this case; it is \nnow headquartered in Florida.  ( Id. at \u00b6 6 )  SFI was a subsidiary of ZNHC , and is a specialty \nfoods company that both imported and distributed various food products, including cheeses .  (Id. \nat \u00b6\u00b6 37-38)   \nECB and AVC are Florida corporations with their principal places of business in Florida.  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 2 -3)  C2B is a French \u201c\u2018cash -pooling\u2019 \u201d entity based in the French territory of \nGuadeloupe , which is  tasked with managing and funding entities related to Claude Blandin, \nBruno Blandin and Patrick Blandin (collectively, \u201cthe Blandins\u201d) .  (Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 13-14)  T he \nBlandins are the owners and operators of a group of French entities, through which they in turn \nown and operate ECB , AVC and C2B.  ( Id. at \u00b6 8)  The Blandins are all French citizens .  (Id. at \n\u00b6\u00b6 9- 11)  Following the closing of the Stock Purcha se Agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d) \u2014a contract at the \nheart of the claims discussed herein \u2014Claude Blandin became the President of SFI, and Bruno \nand Patrick Blandin became directors and o fficers of SFI.  ( Id.)  Leoni  is a French citizen who is \nan associate of the Blandins ; he was appointed CFO  of SFI in the third quarter of 2015, became \nco-CEO of the company in February 2017 and became sole CEO in May 2017.  ( Id. at \u00b6 12)   \nLeoni is also the sole owner of Ilafy Development, LLC, which became a 2% owner of AVC after the Blandins purchased SFI.  ( Id.) 3 \n 2. Relevant Transactions  \nOn December 6, 2014, the SPA was executed.  ( Id. at \u00b6 46)  With the SPA, ZNHC sold \nall of the outstanding shares of SFI  to ECB and third- party Voss Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cVEI\u201d).   (Id.; \nD.I. 39, ex. 1 (\u201c SPA\u201d))  Plaintiff was a guarantor regarding the sale .  (Id.)  On December 10, \n2014, ECB and VEI assigned their interests in SFI to AVC; ECB and VEI owned 55% and 45% \nof AVC, respectively.  ( D.I. 39 at \u00b6 47)   On December 31, 2014, the transaction officially  closed  \n(\u201cthe closing\u201d) .  (Id. at \u00b6 48)    \nThe initial purchase price f or SFI was $27 million.  ( Id.)  This money was payable in the \nfollowing ways:  (1) $2 million was due at the closing; (2) $15 million wa s due at a second \nclosing in June 2015; and (3) four annual, equal subsequent installments of $2.5 million were each due thereafter (the \u201cSubsequent Installments\u201d).  ( Id.)  On June 16, 2015, the parties to the \nSPA entered into Amendment No. 1 to the SPA; i n Amendment No. 1, the parties agreed to a \ndownward adjustment of the total amount of the Subsequent Installments from $10 million to \n$6.1 million (with each such installment payment now being $1.525 million instead of $2.5 million) .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 61 -62) \nAlong with the SPA, ZNHC entered into the Stock Pledge Agreement with ECB and \nVEI; the Stock Pledge Agreement is incorporated into the SPA via the SPA\u2019s Section II.3(b)  and \nis attached to the SPA as an exhibit .  (Id. at \u00b6  49; D.I. 39, ex. 1 at ex. C (\u201cStock Pledge \nAgreement\u201d) )  Pursuant to the Stock Pledge Agreement, ECB and VEI pledged 90% of SFI\u2019s \nstock as collateral to secure the Subsequent Installments due to ZNHC  (in the event of ECB and \nVEI\u2019s default ).  (D.I. 39 at \u00b6 50; Stock Pledge Agreement  at \u00b6\u00b6 1(d), 2, 3 )  \nMuch went wrong from there  in terms of relations between the relevant parties.  As a \nresult, inter alia , ECB and AVC did not pay the $6.1 Subsequent Installments \u2014an outcome that, 4 \n in significant part , led to this lawsuit.  (D.I. 39 at \u00b6 64)2  ECB and AVC  also sold SFI\u2019s assets to \nAtalanta Corporation (\u201cAtalanta\u201d) in February 2018 for at least $12 million.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 98 -99, \n102)  Subsequently, on April 30, 2018, Defendants caused SFI to file an Assignment for the \nBenefit of Creditors Proceeding (an \u201cABC Proceeding\u201d) in Florida, which resulted in SFI being \nliquidated.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 107 -08)  Plaintiff alleges that this \u201cdestroyed, dissipated and disposed of \nthe value of [its] security intere st in 90% of the shares of SFI\u201d that had been pledged as collateral \nto secure the Subsequent Installments.  ( Id. at \u00b6 10 8) \nAdditional relevant factual allegations will be discussed below in the appropriate portions \nof Section II.  \nB. Procedural Background  \nOn December 24, 2020, Plaintiff filed its initial Complaint in this case.  (D.I. 1)  On \nFebruary 1, 2021, United States District Judge Richard G. Andrews referred the case to the Court for all purposes through the case -dispositive motion deadline .  (D.I. 15)  On April 12, 2021, \nPlaintiff filed the FAC.  (D.I. 39)  The FAC contain s nine  causes of action :   \n\u2022 First Cause of Action:  B reach of contract \u2014i.e., the SPA \u2014\nagainst ECB and AVC.  (D.I. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 129 -43) \n \n\u2022 Second Cause of Action:  B reach of contract \u2014i.e., the Stock \nPledge Agreement \u2014against ECB and AVC.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 144- 49)  \n \n\u2022 Third Cause of Action:  B reach of contract \u2014i.e., Amendment \nNo. 1\u2014against ECB and AVC.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 150- 55) \n \n\u2022 Fourth Cause of Action:  Breach of the implied covenant of \ngood faith and fair dealing (relating to the Stock Pledge \nAgreement) against ECB and AVC.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 156 -65) \n \n \n2   The parties and related entities are also involved in various other litigation matters \nwith each other.  These suits include ECB USA, Inc. v. Savencia S.A ., Civil Action No. 19- 731-\nRGA- CJB (D. Del.) , a case in this Court  that also has to do with the SPA  (the \u201cRelated \nLitigation\u201d) . 5 \n \u2022 Fifth Cause of Action:  Equitable a ccounting against all \nDefendants.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 166-73) \n \n\u2022 Sixth Cause of Action:  Tortious interference with contract \nagainst the Individual Defendants and C2B.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 174- 80) \n \n\u2022 Seventh Cause of Action:  Conspiracy to commit tortious interference with contract against the Individual Defendants and C2B.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 181 -87) \n \nBelow, for ease of reference, the Court will refer to these causes of action as \u201cCounts\u201d (e. g., \nCount I, Count II, etc.).  \nOn May 6, 2021, Defendants filed  the motion to dismiss, ( D.I. 42) , and on June 1, \nPlaintiff filed the motion for jurisd ictional discovery, (D.I. 45).  Briefing was completed on the \nmotions  by July 7, 2021.  (D.I.  52)  Plaintiff requested oral argument on the motions, (D.I. 48; \nD.I. 49), which request is  hereby  DENIED.  \nII. DISCUSSION  \n \nDefendants make various challenges to Plaintiff\u2019s FAC  in their motion to dismiss .  The \nCourt will address those challenges in turn below.  \nA. Standing  \nDefendants first argue that all claims against them should be dismissed  for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction and because Plaintiff  lacks standing to bring the claims.  (D.I. 43 at 7- 10)  \nThese arguments stem from Defendants\u2019 assertion that ECB and AVC do not owe any obligation \nto Plaintiff under the SPA \u2014and thus that Plaintiff does not have standing to assert its claims  \npursuant to t he contracts at issue\u2014because ZNHC, not Zausner, was the signatory to the SPA  (as \nthe \u201cSeller\u201d)\n3 and the Stock Pledge Agreement .  (Id. at 7)    \n \n3   Again, a representative of Zausner did sign the SPA, but only as a \u201cGuarantor\u201d \nand not as the \u201cSeller.\u201d  ( SPA at 75 -76) \n 6 \n The Court first addresses the relevant standard of review.  With their argument here, it \nappears that Defendants are raising a \u201c prudential standing\u201d  question:  i.e., one that implicates the \nrequirement that a plaintiff must generally assert his own legal rights and interests, and may not \nrest his claim to relief on the legal rights or inter ests of third parties.  In re Majestic Star Casino, \nLLC, 716 F.3d 736, 748 (3d Cir. 2013); Harrison v. Soroof Int\u2019l, Inc., 320 F. Supp. 3d 602, 610-\n11 (D. Del. 2018); see also  (D.I. 43 at 7- 10 (in this section of its briefing, Plaintiff repeatedly \nassertin g that this is a \u201cstanding\u201d issue and referencing only \u201cprudential standing[,]\u201d not Article \nIII standing)).  Normally \u201clack of standing\u201d arguments are considered jurisdictional issues assessed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), though there is  some question in the \ncourts as to whether a prudential standing challenge is appropriately analyzed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Harrison , 320 F. Supp. 3d at 610- 12 \n(citing cases); see also Martinez v. Bank of Am ., N.A., 664 F. App\u2019x 250, 252 n.3 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(noting that whether a prudential standing issue is properly assessed as a non- jurisdictional issue \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) is an open question, but not deciding the issue).   \nIn this case, the Court will assume that Rule 12(b)(1) applies.  See Future Care \nConsultants, LLC v. Connolly , Civil No. 17- 2552 (RMB/AMD), 2018 WL 1069414, at *3 \n(D.N.J. Feb. 26, 2018);  Acceleration Bay LLC v. Activision Blizzard, Inc., Civil Action Nos. 15-\n228-RGA, 15 -282-RGA, 15 -311-RGA, 2016 WL 3186890, at *5 (D. Del. June 3, 2016).  But its \nanalysis would be little different if Rule 12(b)(6) applied instead.  That is because  under Rule \n12(b)(1),  Defendants\u2019 argument for dismissal here would rightly be characterized as a facial \nchallenge to subject matter jurisdiction \u2014since Defendants do not ask the Court to consider or \nrely on any facts other than those in the FAC or in the exhibits attached thereto ( such as the \nSPA).  (D.I. 43 at 7- 10 (Plaintiff pointi ng only to the FAC and the SPA in making its arguments 7 \n regarding standing)); see also  Harrison , 320 F. Supp. 3d at 611; Future Care , 2018 WL \n1069414, at *3; TSMC Tech., Inc. v. Zond, LLC , Civil Action No. 14- 721-LPS-CJB, 2014 WL \n7498398, at *3 (D. Del. Jan. 8, 2014).  And a facial challenge to jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) \ndoes not materially differ from the inquiry that a court conducts on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion; in both cases, the well -pleaded factual allegations are afforded the presumption of truth.  Harrison , \n320 F. Supp. 3d at 611; Future Care , 2018 WL 1069414, at *3.   \nThe Court now  turns to the merits.  In the FAC, Plaintiff attempted  to pre -empt th is \nstanding issue by repeatedly alleging  that:  (1) ZNHC assigned its rights under the SPA and the \nStock Pledge Agreement to Zausner ; and (2) Zausner is the successor -in-interest  by merger  to \nZNHC .  (D.I. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 131, 146, 147, 158, 159, 160)   Defendants, however, argue that these \nallegations are insuf ficient to remedy a standing problem.  With regard to Plaintiff\u2019s allegation \nthat ZNHC assigned its rights in the SPA  to Zausner, Defendants  retort that there is an anti -\nassignment provision in Section XII.4 of the SPA \u2014and that this provision renders null and void \nany rights  that Zausner might claim to have obtained via  an assignment .  (D.I. 43 at 8)   The \nrelevant portion of that provision is excerpted below (with the portion that Defendants focus on noted in italics) : \nThis Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, \nthe parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, legal \nrepresentatives and permitted assigns.  Neither party may directly or indirectly assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under t his Agreement by operation of law or otherwise, \nwithout the prior written consent of the other party.  Any purported direct or indirect assignment in violation of this Section shall be null and void ab initio. . . .  \n \n(SPA at \u00a7 XII.4  (emphasis added) )  And with regard to Plaintiff\u2019s allegation  that ZNHC became \nZausner due to a merger  (i.e., that Zausner is ZNHC\u2019s successor -in-interest via the merger ), 8 \n Defendants argue that under Delaware law,4 after  a merger, the transfer of any rights from a \npredecessor to a surviving entity is considered to be an assignment of rights  \u201cby operation of \nlaw\u201d (and thus, is not effective here in light of the  above -italicized terms of the  anti-assignment \nprovision).  (D. I. 43 at 8 (citing MTA Canada Royalty Corp. v. Compania Minera Pangea, S.A. \nde C.V ., C.A. No.: N19C -11-228 AML , 2020 WL 5554161 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 16, 2020) ) \n In response, Plaintiff offers a number of reasons why Defendants\u2019 standing arguments \nmiss the mark .  (D.I. 44 at 3- 7)  But t he Court need only address one of them here.  That is \nPlaintiff\u2019s argument that in the portion of Section X II.4 that Defendants quote from, they ignore \nthe first sentence, which states:  \u201cThis Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit \nof, the parties hereto and their respective successors,  heirs, legal representatives and permitted \nassigns.\u201d  (SPA at \u00a7 XII.4  (emphasis added) )  In the Court\u2019s view, this sentence makes it very \nclear that Z NHC\u2019s successor -by-merger, Zausner,5 has the full right to seek to enforce the SPA \u2019s \nprovisions  (including the right to payment  from ECB/AVC ), since those provisions \u201cinure[d] to \n[Zausner \u2019s] benefit\u201d  when it succeeded ZNHC.  ( Id.)  And that is exactly what Zausner is \nseeking to do via t his law suit.  Moreover, Section XII.4\u2019s first sentence leaves little d oubt that \nthe SPA  considers a party\u2019s \u201c successor s\u201d to be a different category of entity than a party\u2019s \n\u201cpermitted assigns.\u201d  \u201cPermitted assigns\u201d are ab le to enjoy the benefits of the SPA, but only if \n \n4   Defendants do not explain why Delaware law would be relevant to this issue, as \nopposed to federal law or Florida state law (t he SPA has a Florida choice -of-law provision) .  \n(SPA at \u00a7 XII.5; D.I. 44 at 4)   In light of the Court\u2019s decision though, it would not matter what \nlaw applies to this standing question; the decision would surely be the same regardless. \n \n5  There surely can be no dispute that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Zausner \nwas ZNHC\u2019s suc cessor -in-interest.  Not only does Plaintiff repeatedly assert that to be so in the \nFAC , (D.I. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 131, 146, 158), but in the Related Litigation, ECB and AVC allege the \nsame (and then use Zausner\u2019s status as successor to ZNHC as a basis to allege t hat Zausner is \nliable for breach of the SPA).  (D.I. 44 at 5 (citing Related Action, D.I. 77 at 1; id ., D.I. 147 at 1 \n& \u00b6 7))  9 \n they are \u201cpermitted\u201d to do so via consent from the other part ies to the SPA .  But \u201c successor s\u201d do \nnot need to get this \u201cpermi [ssion ]\u201d in o rder to enjoy the SPA\u2019s fruits \u2014since in the first sentence \nof Section XII.4, the parties explicitly agreed that a successor necessarily enjoys those very \nrights  from the start .  \n Defendants claim that reading the first sentence of Section XII.4 in this way would render \nthe next two sentences of the anti -assignment provision \u201cuseless or inexplicable.\u201d  (D.I. 47 at 2 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted))  In other words, Defendants argue that:  (1)  when \nthe anti -assignment provision is refe rring to the assignment of rights \u201cby operation of law\u201d it \nmust be referring to a scenario where rights transfer from a predecessor entity to a surviving \nentity by merger ; (2) the anti -assignment provision says that assignment of rights \u201cby opera tion \nof law\u201d do not take effect without the prior written consent of the other part y to the SPA, so (3) \nPlaintiff\u2019s reading of the provision (which would not require such written consent in such a \nscenario) must be wrong.  Defendants\u2019 logic rests on the as sumption that the provision\u2019s \nreference to assignment \u201cby operation of law\u201d can  only be referring to  an assignment -via-\nmerger -type scenario.  Yet th e Court does not see why that is so.  T here could  well be other \nways \u2014in addition to a merger \u2014that a party c ould be said to have assign ed its rights under the \nSPA \u201cby operation of law .\u201d  That might happen, by way of just one example, via the transfer of \nproperty from a debtor to a bankruptcy estate in a bankruptcy proceeding.  Cf. King v.  Ind. \nHarbor  Belt R.R.  Co., Case No. 2:15- CV-245 JD, 2018 WL 1566821, at *2 (N.D. Ind. Mar. 30, \n2018) (\u201c At the time a  debtor  files a bankruptcy petition, the  debtor \u2019s property, by operation of \nlaw, becomes part of the bankruptcy estate whether properly disclose d or not.\u201d); In  re Ordonez , \nBankruptcy Number: 10- 37596, 2018 WL 1135498, at *4 (Bankr. D. Utah Feb. 28, 2018) ( \u201cThe \nDebtor \u2019s legal claims in the Lawsuit are property.  When she filed bankruptcy, those legal claims 10 \n became part of the bankruptcy estate, alo ng with all other \u2018legal or equitable interests of the \ndebtor in property.\u2019[]  This transfer of the  Debtor \u2019s property into the  bankruptcy estate is done by \noperation of  law, specifically the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d) .   \n For these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has withstood Defendants\u2019 facial \nchallenge to s tanding here , pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) . \nB. Personal Jurisdiction  \nNext, Defendants argue that all of the claims against the  Individual Defendants s hould be \ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) .  \n(D.I. 43 at 10- 14)  In support  of this argument , the Individual Defendants filed declarations \nstating that they never transacted any business in, performed any work in or engaged in any \nconduct directed to the State of Delaware, and otherwise have no meaningful contacts with the \nstate.  (D.I. 43, ex. A)  \nBelow, the Court will first set out the legal standard regarding a Rule 12(b)(2) challenge.  \nThen it will tur n to the merits.  \n1. Legal Standard  \nRule 12(b)(2) directs courts to dismiss a case when the  court lacks p ersonal jurisdiction \nover the defendant.  When a defendant moves to dismiss a lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing the basis for jurisdiction.  Power \nIntegrations, Inc. v. BCD Semiconductor Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 365, 369 (D. Del. 2008).  To \nsatisfy its burden, the plaintiff must produce \u201c\u2018sworn affidavits or other competent evidence,\u2019\u201d \nsince this type of Rule 12(b)(2) motion \u201c\u2018requires resolution of factual issues outside the \npleadings.\u2019\u201d  Marnavi S.p.A. v. K eehan , 900 F. Supp. 2d 377, 385 (D. Del. 2012) (quoting Time \nShare Vacation Club v. Atl. Resorts, Ltd., 735 F.2d 61, 67 & n.9 (3d Cir. 1984));  see also 11 \n Perlight Solar Co. Ltd. v. Perlight Sales N. Am. LLC , C.A. No. 14- 331-LPS, 2015 WL 5544966, \nat *2 (D. De l. Sept. 18, 2015).  In a case like this one , where a district court has not held an \nevidentiary hearing, the plaintiff must only make a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction \nexists.  See Perlight Solar , 2015 WL 5544966, at *2;  Hardwire, LLC v. Ze ro Int\u2019l, Inc ., Civil \nAction No. 14- 54-LPS-CJB, 2014 WL 5144610, at *5 (D. Del. Oct. 14, 2014).  To do so, the \nplaintiff must establish with reasonable particularity sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum state.  Mellon Bank (E.) PSFS, Nat \u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Farino, 960 F.2d 1217, 1223 (3d Cir. \n1992).  All factual inferences to be drawn from the pleadings, affidavits and exhibits must be drawn in the plaintiff\u2019s favor at this stage.  Hardwire , 2014 WL 5144610, at *5 (citing cases);  \nPower Integrations , 547 F. Supp. 2d at 369. \nIn order to establish personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff typically must adduce facts \nsufficient to satisfy two requirements \u2014one statutory and one constitutional.

Discussion  12 \n Plaintiff asserts that this Court has personal jurisdiction over the Individual Defendants  \non multiple grounds .  (See, e.g., D.I. 44 at 2)  First,  Plaintiff contends that the Individual \nDefendants are bound by the Delaware forum selection clauses in the SPA  (Sect ion XII.5)  and \nAmendment No. 1 (paragraph 9) .  Second, Plaintiff argues that  the Court has jurisdiction under \nDelaware\u2019s l ong-arm statute .   Third, Plaintiff asserts tha t the Court can exercise jurisdiction \npursuant to the conspiracy doctrine  of personal jurisdiction.  F ourth and f inally, Plaintiff points \nto the a lter ego theory as warranting the exercise of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.   \nFor the reasons discussed below, th e Court finds that plaintiff has failed to make a prima \nfacie showing that personal jurisdiction exists  with respect to each of these theories.   \na. The SPA and Amendment No. 1\u2019s Forum Selection Clauses  \n \n When a party enters into an agreement that contains a valid forum selection clause, the \nparty is considered to have expressly consented to personal jurisdiction in the relevant \njurisdiction .  See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 472 n.14 (1985) ; ECB \nUSA, Inc. v. Savencia, S.A., Civil Action No. 19- 731-RGA- CJB, 2020 WL 11762200, at *7 (D. \nDel. July 10, 2020).6  Delaware courts have found that a non- signatory to an agreement can be \nbound by the agreement\u2019s f orum selection clause where three elements are satisfied:  (1) the \nforum selection clause is valid; (2) the non- signatory is a third -party beneficiary of the agreement \nor is closely related to the agreement; and (3) the claim against the non -signatory arises from the \nnon-signatory\u2019s status relating to the agreement .

(D.I. 44 at 7- 9)  \n As to this issue, the parties dispute only whether the second element of th e above -\nreferenced test is satisfied.8  On that front, Plaintiff\u2019s theory is that the Individual Defendants are \n\u201cclosely related\u201d t o both the SPA and Amendment No. 1.  ( Id. at 8)  The \u201cclosely relat ed\u201d test is \nan application of equitable estoppel , serving to \u201cprevent a non- signatory from embracing a \ncontract, and then turning its back on the portions of the contract . . . that it finds distasteful .\u201d  \nTruinject  Corp., 2019 WL 6828984, at *12 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); \nNeurvana Med., LLC v.

In re McGraw -Hill Global Educ. Holdings LLC , 909 \nF.3d 48, 58- 59 (3d Cir. 2018).

Truinject Corp., 2019 WL \n6828984, at *12; Neurvana Med., LLC , 2019 WL 4464268, at *4.9 \n The Court first takes up the \u201c direct benefit \u201d prong of the \u201c closely related \u201d test.  Plaintiff \nargues that the Blandins  received a direct benefit from the SPA and Amendment No. 1 because:  \n(1) they own and operate ECB and AVC; (2) they were officers and/or directors of these \ncompanies; and (3) post -closing, they were officers and/or directors of SFI .  (D.I. 44 at 8)  As for \nLeoni, Plaintiff asserts  that he received  a direct benefit by later becoming CEO of SFI in 2017 \nand by being awarded a 2% ownership stake in AVC  after the closing of the SPA .  (Id.)  \nAdditionally, according to Plaintiff, all Individual Defendants benefitted personally \u201cfrom the conspiracy through which they sold assets of SFI and refused to pay the [Subsequent \nInstallments].\u201d   (Id.)  The Court is not persuaded.   \nDelaware state courts have explained that for th e \u201cdirect benefit\u201d test to be satisfied, a \nnon-signatory \u201cmust actually receive a benefit under or by way of the contract .\u201d  Sustainability \nPartners LLC v. Jacobs , C.A. No. 2019- 0742- SG, 2020 WL 3119034, at *6 (Del. Ch. June 11, \n \n9  As an initial matter, the Individual Defendant s point out that  some courts have \nraised constitutional concerns in a scenario like this (i.e., when a court is asked to utilize the \n\u201cclosely related\u201d test in order to find personal jurisdiction over a non- signatory to an agreement \ncontaining a forum selection clause), were a court to find personal jurisdiction without engaging in a further due process minimum contacts analysis.  (D.I. 47 at 5- 7 (citing Truinject  Corp., 2019 \nWL 6828984, at *11))  This concern seems especially relevant in cases where the non -signatory \nwas not aware of or involved in the negotiations leading up to the  execution of the relevant \nagreement.  See Truinject  Corp., 2019 WL 6828984, at *10- 11; Finjan LLC v. Trustwave \nHoldings, Inc., C.A. No. 20- 371-LPS, 2021 WL 5051147, at *9 (D. Del.

Here, the Blandins \nwere allegedly involved in the negotiations regarding the acquisition of SFI , and all Individual \nDefendants were alleged to have been involved in the negotiations regarding Amendment No. 1.

When examining \nwhether a non -signatory is \u201cclosely related\u201d to an agreement, the court generally looks to the \nparties\u2019 conduct after the agreement was executed.  Eastman v. Chem. Co. v. AlphaPet Inc., Civ . \nAction No. 09- 971-LPS-CJB, 2011 WL 6004079, at *9 (D. Del. Nov. 4, 2011).   \nAs an initial matter, Plaintiff does not elaborate on how the Blandins \u2019 ownership and \noperation of ECB and AVC , or their roles as officers and/or directors of these companies , \nresulted in the Blandins\u2019 receipt  of a direct benefit  pursuant to the terms of the SPA and/or \nAmendment No. 1.  The FAC does not allege that the terms of the SPA or Amendment No. 1 \nmade any reference to the Blandins\u2019 connections to ECB and AVC , nor that those connections \nwere somehow required by or directly f lowed from t he agreements .  (See D.I. 47 at 9)   Indeed, \nthe allegations are that the Blandins\u2019 relationships with ECB and AVC were established prior to \nthe SPA\u2019s closing.  ( See, e.g., D.I . 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 23, 45)  Thus, this particular theory fails .  See, e.g., \nPartners & Simons, Inc. v. Sandbox Acquisitions, LLC , C.A. No. 2020- 0776- MTZ, 2021 WL \n3161651, at *6 (Del. Ch. July 26, 2021) ( rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the non- signatory \nreceived a direct benefit under t he agreement due to his role as the sole ma nager and board \nmember of the company being sold, where the complaint alleged that the non- signatory was \nappointed to those positions via an independent contractual right before the relevant agreement\u2019s \nterms were finalized).   \n The Court next turns to Plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the Individual Defendants derived a \ndirect benefit from the SPA  and Amendment No. 1 because they all became directors/officers of \nSFI following the acquisition (and that Leoni was awarded a 2% ownership in AVC  following  16 \n the acquisition  or by later becoming SFI \u2019s CEO ).  (D.I. 4 4 at 8; see also D.I. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 65, 75, 87)  \nHowever, the terms of the co ntracts at issue do not expressly require that the Individual \nDefendants must obtain these benefits after the SPA\u2019s closing.  (D.I. 47 at 9)  Nor is there any \nallegation that these benefits were otherwise a necessary  result of the execution of the contracts .  \nInstead, the y are simply events  that happened to occur after the SPA  and Amendment No. 1 were \nsigned.  To be sure, they are events  that can be linked back in some way to the signing of the \nagreements :  i.e., \u201cFirst, the agreements were signed.  Once the agreements were signed, then the  \nBlandins indirectly owned SFI.  Once the Blandins indirectly owned SFI, the n they had the \nability to have themselves a ppointed as officers/directors .

See, e.g. , Phunware, Inc. v. \nExcelmind Grp. Ltd., 117 F. Supp. 3d 613, 629- 30 (D. Del. 2015) ( rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 \nargument that a non- signatory was closely related to the agreement , where a letter of intent \nsetting forth the material terms for an acquisition identified the non- signatory as the major holder \nof the stock that was the principal asset transferred in the transaction governed by the agreement, because any benefit the non- signatory would receive through its status as  the major holder of the \nstock would be an indirect  benefit ); Eastman Chem.

Instead, \nthis would seem to be a benefit that flows from a later  alleged  breach  of th e agreement s.  See \nBAM Int\u2019l, LLC v. MSBA Grp. I nc., C.A.

Dec. 14, 2021)  (noting that the \u201creceipt of the allegedly purloined funds by the Moving \nDefendants would not be a benefit from the contract, but from the breach of the contract\u201d)  \n(emphasis in or iginal) .   \nThus, Plaintiff has not established a prima facie  showing that Individual Defendants have \nreceived a direct benefit from the SPA and Amendment No. 1, such that they could be bound by the forum selection clauses therein.   \n \n10  The cases that Plaintiff cites do not compel a different conclusion.  (D.I. 44 at 8; \nD.I. 47 a t 8)  In Baker v. Impact Holding, Inc., Civil Action No. 4960- VCP, 2010 WL 1931032 \n(Del. Ch. May 13, 2010), the Delaware Court of Chancery found that a non -signatory to an \nagreement was bound by a forum selection clause  because he was closely related to th e \nagreement , where, inter alia , the agreement \u201cexpressly\u201d provided the non- signatory with a seat \non the board of directors of a company, thus constituting a direct benefit to the non- signatory.  \n2010 WL 1931032, at *1, *4.  And in Cap. Grp. Cos., Inc. v. A rmour , No. Civ.A. 422- N, 2004 \nWL 2521295 (Del. Ch. Nov. 3, 2004), the non- signatory and her spouse transferred stock to a \ntrust and, in doing so, signed a joinder agreement in which they agreed to be bound by the \nsubject contract .  Id. at *1 -2.  The Court of Chancery explained that by putting the stock in trust, \nthe non- signatory gained a beneficial interest in the stock, and t hat the trust  had to agree to the \ncontract at issue in order for the stock to be transferred; thus the  execution of the  contract \nprovided t he non- signatory with a direct benefit.  Id. at * 7.  Although Plaintiff  curiously \ncharacterizes this case as one in which a \u201cforme r CEO was bound by a forum selection clause \neven though she was not a party to the contract[,]\u201d (D.I. 44 at 8), those are not the actual facts of \nthe case.   18 \n The second way that a plaintiff can demonstrate that a non -signatory is closely related to \nan agreement  is through the foreseeability prong.  Delaware courts have explained that where, as \nhere, foreseeability  must be a standalone basis for finding a non- signatory to be closely related to \nan agreement, the prong has been \u2014and should be \u2014narrowly applied in only two scenarios:  \u201c(1) \nwhen non- signatory defendants  sought  to enforce a forum selection clause, and the signatory \nplaintiffs  sought to avoid it by arguing the non- signatory defendants lacked standing under the \ncontract.;[] and (2) when a controlled entity is subject to a forum selection clause agreed to by its \ncontroller and the controlled entity bears a clear and significant connection to the subject matter \nof the agreement.\u201d  Sustainability Partners LLC , 2020 WL 3119034, at *7 (in ternal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted)  (emphasis in original) ; Neurvana Med., LLC , 2019 WL 4464268, at \n*5-6; see also Truinject  Corp., 2019 WL 6828984, at *13.  These courts have explained that if \none of those two circumstances is not at play, then e ven if the non- signatory was actively \ninvolved in negotiating the relevant agreement, that fact ( standing alone ) cannot satisfy the \nforeseeab ility inquiry ; this is because such a theory would generally entail rejecting principles of \ncorporate separateness, which in turn results in uncertainty for participants in transactions.  Sustainability Partners LLC , 2020 WL 3119034, at *7; Neurvana Med., LLC , 2019 WL \n4464268, at *6- 8; see also , e.g., Partners & Simons, Inc., 2021 WL 3161651, at *6- 8 (\u201cMore \ngenerally, expanding the foreseeability test to reach Krawetz as the human decisionmaker for the \nsignatory entity would clash with and erode the general rule that individuals who sign \nagreements on behalf of the corporate entities they represent are not personally bound by forum \nselection clauses in those agreements \u201d).11 \n \n11  It makes sense that  there are only a cabined number of scenarios in which the \ndirect benefit pr ong or the foreseeability prong of the \u201cclosely related\u201d test  can be met , pursuant \nto Delaware law.  After all, these analyses  occur where a party is asking the court to find that its 19 \n Here, the Individual Defendants are not seeking to enforce the forum selection clause \nagainst Plaintiff .  Nor is this a situation where the signatories to the agreement s are attempting to \nmanipulate \u201c an end -run around the forum selection [ clauses ]\u201d so as to avoid personal jurisdiction \nas to the companies they control.  Neurvana Med., LLC , 2019 WL 4464268, a t *5.  Instead, \nPlaintiff\u2019s sole argument is that it was reasonably foreseeable that the Individual Defendants \nwould be bound by the SPA and Amendment No. 1 because :  (1) they were \u201cintimately \ninvolved\u201d with the negotiations and purchase of SFI (as well as  with subsequent events relating \nto the company); and (2) two of them ( Claude Blandin, who s igned the SPA and Amendment \nNo. 1 on behalf of ECB ) and Bruno Blandin (who was ECB\u2019s designated signatory on the Stock \nPledge Agreement ) signed the agreements .  (D.I. 44 at 9;  see also  SPA at 77; Stock Pledge \nAgreement at 9; D.I. 39, ex. 2 at 6)   But as noted above, mere \u201cactive involvement\u201d in the \nnegotiations, standing alone, cannot satisfy this prong.  See Partners & Simons, Inc., 2021 WL 3161651, at *6- 9.  \nIn sum, Plaintiff has failed to make a prima facie  showing that the Individual Defendants \nare \u201cclosely related\u201d t o the SPA and /or Amendment No. 1; thus, the Individual Defendants are \nnot bound by the forum selection clauses in these agreements .   \nb.

(D.I. 44 at 10- 13)  This \n \nadversary should be bound by a forum selection clause in a contract \u2014a co ntract as to which the \nadversary was not in fact a party.  In those circumstances, in order for it to be said that there is personal jurisdiction over the adversary, it needs to be very clear  that th e adversary would have \nexpected to be, or intended to be , bound by the forum selection clause.  Were this not so, the \nconcept of purposeful availment that is so central to a finding of personal jurisdiction would be seriously diluted.  See Neurvana Med., LLC , 2019 WL 4464268, at *5- 6; cf.

The relevant subsections of the long- arm-\nstatute here ( Section 3104(c)(1) , as well S ection 3104(c)(3) , which is further discussed below ) \nare specific jurisdiction provision s, which require that the cause of action arise from the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct in the forum state.

June 2, 2011) , the all egations \nestablished actual  relevant  acts occurring in Delaware, including that the plai ntiff provided \nmanagement services to the corporate defendant  (and to the corporate defendant\u2019s pr edecessor \ncompany) from Delaware and that t wo of the  individual defendants traveled to Delaware and met \nwith plaintiff there prior to entering into the cont racts at issue .  2011 WL 2347612, at *1- 2, *5- 6.  22 \n    c. Conspiracy Doctrine  \n Plaintiff next asserts that the Court has personal jurisdiction over the Individual \nDefendants pursuant to the conspiracy doctrine .  (D.I. 44 at 13- 14)14  With this doctrine , a court \nmay exercise personal jurisdiction over non- residents based on the forum contacts of their co-\nconspirators.  Instituto Bancario Italiano v. Hunter Eng\u2019g Co., 449 A.2d 210, 222 (De l. 1982) .  \nHowever, t his theory requires the plaintiff to demonstrate, inter alia , that a substantial act or \nsubstantial effect in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred in Delaware .  Id. at 225; see also, \ne.g., Altabef v. Neugarten, Civil Action No. 2021- 0117- MTZ, 2021 WL 5919459, at *8 (Del. Ch. \nDec. 15, 2021) ( \u201cA conspiracy is not a n independent jurisdictional hook:  there must still be an \nanchoring Delaware act.\u201d).   \n In its briefing, Plaintiff contends that the Individual Defendants and their alleged co-\nconspirators ECB and AVC together engaged in a conspiracy to avoid paying the Subsequent \nInstallments due to Plaintiff, and that the acts of ECB and AVC can be attributed to the Individual Defendants for jurisdictional purposes.\n15  (D.I. 44 at 14)  In attempting to make out \n \nAnd in Kahn v. Lynch Commc\u2019n Sys., Inc., CIVIL ACTION No . 8748, 1989 WL 99800 (Del. Ch. \nAug. 24, 1989) , the court found that the defendant was subject to personal jurisdiction pursuant \nto Section 3104(c)(1) where it was directly involved in the wrongful conduct that resulted in a \nmerger at issue between a Delaw are corporation and the defendant\u2019s subsidiary.  1989 W L \n99800 at *1, *4; see also Sample v. Morgan, 935 A.2d 1046, 1057 n.42 (Del. Ch. 2007) (explaining that the merger in Kahn constituted the transaction of business within the meaning of \nSection 3104(c)(1)  because \u201cthe merger\u2019s consummatio n required a filing with the [Delaware] \nSecretary of State\u201d).   \n \n14  In making its argument as to why there is personal jurisdiction under the \nconspiracy doctrine, Plaintiff points not only to Section 3104(c)(1) , but also to Section \n3104(c)(3)  of the long- arm statute .  (D.I. 44 at 13)  Section 3104(c)(3)  allows the court to \nexercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant when that person \u201c[c]auses tortious injury in the S tate by an act or omission in this State [.]\u201d  Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 3104(c)(3) .   \n \n15  It is not disputed that ECB and AVC have clearly consented to jurisdiction in this \nCourt.  ( D.I. 44 at 14; D.I. 47 at 7 n.3)   23 \n the requisite connection to Delaware, Plaintiff simply state s that \u201cthe conspiracy produced a \nsignificant effect in Delaware:  the deliberate non -payment of the [Subsequent Installments] \nowed to Zausner, a Delaware corporation.\u201d  ( Id.)  But t his argument ignores the fact that \nPlaintiff\u2019s principal place of business i s in Pennsylvania .  (D.I. 39 at \u00b6 1)   Therefore, non-\npayment of money due to Plaintiff (which, had it been paid, would have inured to Plaintiff\u2019s \nbenefit in Pennsylvania) is not a s ufficient anchoring act in Delaware to confer jurisdiction  under \nthe conspi racy doctrine.  (D.I. 47 at 10) ; see Ninespot, Inc.  v. Jupai  Holdings  Ltd., Civil Action \nNo. 18- 144-RGA, 2018 WL 3626325, at *6 (D. Del. July 30, 2018)  (explaining that \u201c the \nDelaware Long -Arm Statute does not provide for jurisdiction over defendants who enter into a \ncontract with a  Delaware  corporation and subsequently cause harm by breaching the contract, \nwhen the  harm  does not occur in the state \u201d); Turf  Nation, Inc.  v. UBU Sports, Inc. , C.A. No. : \nN17C -01-271 EMD  CCLD, 2017 WL 4535970, at *10 (Del. Super. Ct.

Alter Ego Theory  \n Finally, Plaintiff argues that the Court has personal jurisdiction over the Individual \nDefendants pursuant to an  alter ego t heory , based on Plaintiff\u2019s  allegations that the Individual \nDefendants are alter egos of C2B, ECB and AVC .  (D.I. 44 at 14- 15)  Dela ware courts have \n\u201crather strictly\u201d applied the alter ego theory of personal jurisdiction, using an analysis similar to that used in determining whether to pierce the corporate veil.  Fidelity Nat\u2019l Info. Servs., Inc. v. Plano Encryption Techs., LLC , Civil Action No. 15- 777-LPS-CJB, 2016 WL 1650763, at *4 (D. \nDel. Apr. 25, 2016) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Moreover, a pplication of 24 \n this theor y in the personal jurisdiction context , requires , inter alia , \u201cthe existence of acts in \nDelaware  which can be fairly imputed to the out -of-state defendant and which satisfy the long-\narm statute and/or federal due process requirements. \u201d  Altabef , 2021 WL 5919459, at *11 \n(emphasis added) ; see also CLP Toxicology, Inc. v. Casla Bio Holdings LLC , C.A. No. 2018-\n0783- PRW, C.A. No. N18C -10-332 PRW CCLD, 2020 WL 3564622, at *1 3 & n. 101 (Del. Ch. \nJune 29, 2020) .   \n Plaintiff does not even attempt to explain how this requirement of the alter ego theory  is \nsatisfied  here.  (D.I . 44 at 15)  As discussed above, it has not identified a single relevant act \nrelated to its allegations of wrongdoing that occurred in Delaware.  Thus, for at least this reason, \nPlaintiff\u2019s reliance on the alter ego theory of jurisdiction also fails.  ( D.I. 43 at 13; D.I. 47 at 10)  \n  3. Conclusion  \n For the  above  reasons, Plaintiff has not made a prima facie  showing of personal \njurisdiction as to the Individual Defendants.  T herefore, the Court recommends that the Motion \nbe granted as to the claims against the Individual Defendants.16    \n \n16  Notwithstanding Plaintiff\u2019s assertion that it sufficiently made out a prima facie \nshowing of personal jurisdiction , Plaintiff also filed an \u201calternative motion\u201d seeking to conduct \njurisdictional discovery.  (D.I. 45)  As noted above, the Court has determined that P laintiff has \nnot in fact made out its prima  facie  showing.  With regard to the forum selection clause issue, th e \nCourt\u2019s  decision largely turned on a legal analysis as to why the \u201cclosely related\u201d doctrine does \nnot apply here .  As to the other purported bases for personal jurisdiction, the decision rested  on \nthe fact that there is just no evidence at all to suggest that the Individual Defendants ever \nperformed a relevant act in Delaware.   \n In a prior decision, the Court has explained why , pursuant to the  applicable law of the \nThird Circuit , if a party has not made out a prima facie  showing of  personal jurisdiction, then the \nparty is not entitled to take jurisdictional discovery.  See 3G  Licensing, S.A. v.  Lenovo  Grp.  Ltd., \nCivil Action No. 17- 84-LPS, 2019 WL 3974539, at *8- 9 (D. Del. Aug. 22, 2019), report  and \nrecommendation adopted, Civil Action No. 17- 84-LPS, 2019 WL 7635823 (D. Del. Sept. 19, \n2019)  (citing cases) ; cf. CLP Toxicology, Inc., 2020 WL 3564622, at *15.  Put differently, and \ncontrary to Plaintiff\u2019s argument, (D.I. 52 at 1 -2, 7, 9), the  relevant law does not allow for a \nscenario where a party has failed to make out a prima facie  showing of personal jurisdiction, but 25 \n C. Failure to State a Claim  \nDefendants next argue that in the FAC, Plaintiff fails to state a claim as to each of its \ncauses of action , such that those claims should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) .  (D.I. 43 \nat 15-19) \nThe sufficiency of pleadings for non- fraud clai ms is governed by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 8, which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief[.]\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).   When presented with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss for failure to state a claim, a court conducts a two -part analysis.  Fowler v. UPMC \nShadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009).  First, the court separates the factual and legal \nelements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the complaint\u2019s well- pleaded facts as true, but \n[disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d  Id.  at 210- 11.  Second, the court determines \u201cwhether the \nfacts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a \u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009)).  In assessing the \nplausibility of a claim, the court must \u201cconstrue the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d  Id.  at 210 (quoting Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 233 \n(3d Cir. 2008)).  \nBelow, the Court addresses Defendants \u2019 arguments as to the respective claims in turn.\n17 \n 1. The Contract Claims (Counts  I, II, III and IV)  \n \nstill somehow ha s made out a sufficient showing to warrant obtaining jurisdictional discovery.  \nSee id.   Therefore, the Court DENIES Plaintiff\u2019s motion for jurisdictional discovery.   \n17  The parties agree that Florida law applies to the substantive claims  at issue here \nand that it is relevant to the analysis in this subsection  of the Report and Recommendation.  (D.I. \n43 at 14; D.I. 44 at 17- 20)  \n  26 \n With regard to Defendants \u2019 arguments as to the contract claims in Counts I -IV, the Court \nhere will largely focus on Counts II and IV.18 \nIn Count II of the FAC, which is a breach of contract claim against ECB and AVC for \nbreach of the Stock Pledge Agreement , (D.I. 39 at \u00b6 \u00b6 144- 49),19 Plaintiff alleges that ECB and \nAVC \u201cbreached the Stock Pledge Agreement by causing SFI to enter [the ABC P roceeding ] \nwithout prior notice to and consent from Zausner, thereby disposing of Zausner\u2019s collateral for \n[the Subsequent Installments ,]\u201d (id. at \u00b6 148) .  Defendant s argue that Plaintiff has not sufficiently \nalleged a breach of contract  here because Plaintiff has pointed to nothing in the Stock Pledge \nAgreement requiring Plaintiff\u2019s notice or consent in order to put SFI into an ABC proceeding.  \n(D.I. 43 at 15)   \nPlaintiff, however, responds by:  (1) pointing to its earlier allegation in the FAC \nestablishing that , in Section 8 of the Stock Pledge Agreement, ECB /AVC  agreed that they would \n\u201cnot . . . dispose of . . . any of the Collateral or any interest therein except as expressly provided \nfor herein or with the prior written consent of Secured Party[,]\u201d (D.I. 39 at \u00b6 55 (brackets and \nemphasis omitted) ; see also S tock Pledge Agreement at \u00b6 8 ); and (2) arguing that  because \n \n18  With respect to Count I, which alleges a breach of contract claim against ECB and \nAVC for breach of the SPA, (D.I. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6  129- 43), and Count III, which alleges a breach of \ncontract claim against ECB and AVC for breach of Amendment No. 1, ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 150- 55), \nDefendants\u2019 only argument for dismissal relates to its  lack -of-standing argument addressed in \nSection II.A (i.e., that Plaintiff lacks standing to enforce a breach of the respective agreements \nand is not owed any money pursuant to the agreements because Plaintiff is not a signatory to the agreements).  (D.I. 43 at 15- 16; D.I. 44 at 2, 16)  For the reasons the Court set out in Section \nII.A, these arguments should be rejected.   \n \n19  Under Florida law, the elements of a breach of contract claim are:  (1) the \nexistence of a contract; (2) a breach of the contract and (3) damages that resulted from the breach.  DNA Sports Performance Lab., Inc. v. Club Atlantis Condo. Assoc., Inc., 219 So. 3d \n107, 109 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2017).   \n 27 \n ECB/AVC are alleged to have \u201cdestroyed, dissipated and disposed of the value of Zausner\u2019s \nsecurity interest in 90% of the shares of SFI\u201d via the ABC proceeding, this amounts to a breach of Section 8, ( D.I. 39 at \u00b6 108).  (D.I. 44 at 16- 17)  These prior allegations from the FAC are \nexpressly incorporated into Count II.  ( D.I. 39 at \u00b6 144)   And in light of th ose allegation s, the \nCourt is not persuaded that Count II fails to state a plausible claim.\n20   \n In Count IV, Plaintiff alleges a claim against ECB and AVC for breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing with respect to the S tock P ledge A greement .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n156-65)  Pursuant to Florida law, \u201cevery contract includes an implied covenant that the parties \nwill perform in good faith.\u201d  Bergman v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., Case Number: 05 -\n21238- CIV-MORENO, 2005 WL 8156741, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2005) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted) (discussing Florida law).  T he implied coven ant of good faith and \nfair dealin g is a \u201cgap -filling default rule which comes into play when a question is not resolved \nby the terms of the contract [between parties] or when one party has the power to make a discretionary decision without defined standards.\u201d  Maor v. Dollar Thrifty Auto. Grp., Inc ., 303 \nF. Supp. 3d 1320, 1327 (S.D. Fla. 2017) (citing Florida law) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Florida courts have disallowed such a claim in two situations:  \u201c (1) the implied \ncovenant  . . . should not be invoked to override express terms of the agreement [;] and (2) there \ncan be no cause of action absent an allegation that an express term of the con tract has been \nbreached. \u201d  Bergman, 2005 WL 8156741, at *3 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .   \nDefendants contend that this claim must be dismissed  because \u201cthere is no underlying \nbreach of the Stock Pledge [Agreement].\u201d  (D.I. 43 at 16)  Ho wever, as discussed above  with \n \n20  In their reply brief, Defendants did not respond to any of Plaintiff\u2019s arguments \nregarding the plausibility of the substantive claims.  (D.I. 47)   \n 28 \n regard to Count II, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a breach of the Stock Pledge Agreement .    \nThus, Defendants\u2019 argument here too must fail.  \n 2. Equitable Accounting ( Count V ) \n Count V is a claim for equitable accounting, brought against all Defendants.  (D.I. 39 at \n\u00b6\u00b6 166- 73)  Under Florida law, this type of a claim can be a stand -alone cause of action ; a party \nseeking such an accounting must show either:  \u201c (1) a sufficiently co mplicated transaction and an \ninadequate  remedy  at law[;] or (2) the existence of a fiduciary relationship.\u201d   Schmidt  v. Wells  \nFargo Bank, N.A. , Case No. 8:20- cv-150-T-33AAS, 2020 WL 758161, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 14, \n2020)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .   \nIn Claim V , Plaintiff re quests an equitable accounting of ECB\u2019s and AVC\u2019s assets and \nfinances to determine if th ose entities fraudulently transferred the funds from the sale of SFI\u2019s \nassets to Atalanta  (the \u201ctransaction\u201d) .  (D.I. 39 at \u00b6 169)   Defendants contend that Count V must \nbe dismissed for  four reasons:  (1) such a claim can only be raise d \u201cas to the accounts between \nthe parties to a transaction \u201d (here, the transaction between SFI and Atalanta) , but Plaintiff \u201cis a \nstranger\u201d to the transaction; (2) Plaintiff fails to allege a fiduciary relationship with any of the \nDefendants or with any of the parties to the transaction; (3) the transa ction is not complex; and \n(4) Plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law ( i.e., damages).  (D.I. 43 at 16 -17)   \n These arguments each fail.  With respect to Defendants\u2019 first argument, the sole case that \nthey cite in support, Managed Care Sols., Inc. v. Essent Healthcare, Inc. , 694 F. Supp. 2d 1275, \n1280 (S.D. Fla. 2010), does not actually hold that  only parties in direct privity with each other \ncan seek an equitable accounting from each other in litigation, (D.I. 44 at 17 n.12) .  So the Court \ncannot find that  the claim is insufficiently ple aded on that basis .  Defendants\u2019 second argument is \ninsufficient becaus e establishing a fiduciary relationship is not a requirement if the claim 29 \n sufficiently pleads a complex transaction and an inadequate remedy at law.  Schmidt , 2020 WL \n758161, at *5; see also (D.I. 44 at 18).  A s to the third argument, here the FAC alleges that the \nunderlying transaction between the parties (pursuant to the SPA a nd Amendment No. 1)  is \ncomplex .  (D.I. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 167, 170)   And this allegation  seems plausible, since:  (1) the transaction \nat issue has generated three separate lawsuits in two federal courts ; (2) it involve s a \u201cmulti- tiered \nstructure for securing payment \u201d for SFI\u2019s sale ; and (3) implicates  a number of different \ncontractual agreements  and many different parties/ related corporations/relevant actors , (D.I. 39 \nat \u00b6 167; D.I. 44 at 18).  See Lan Li  v. Walsh , CASE NO. 16- 81871- CIV-MARRA , 2017 WL \n3130392, at *7 (S.D. Fla. July 24, 2017) .  Finally, as for Defendants\u2019 assertion that Plaintiff has \nan adequate remedy at law, the FAC pleads that Plaintiff cannot assert breach of contract claims \nagainst C2B ( or the Individual Defendants ) because they are not parties to the SPA, and thus \ncannot obtain an adequate remedy at law at least as to them .  (D.I. 39 at \u00b6 172)   This is sufficient \nat this stage of the case.   \n  3. Tortious Interference with Contract (Count VI)  \n Count VI is  a claim for tortious interference with contract, brought against the Individual \nDefendants and C2B.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 174- 80)  Pursuant to Florida law, a plaintiff asserting a tortious \ninterference claim must establish:  (1) the existence of a contractual relationship; (2) knowledge \nof the relationship on the part of the defendant; (3) an intentional and unjustified interference \nwith the relationship by the defendant; and (4) damage to the plaintiff as a result of the breach of \nthe relationship.  All Tag Corp. v. Checkpoint Sys., Inc ., CASE NO. 17 -81261- CIV-\nDIMITROULEAS, 2018 WL 6514795, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 27, 2018); Ethan Allan, Inc. v. \nGeorgetown Manor, Inc., 647 So. 2d 812, 814 (Fla. 1994) .    30 \n As discussed above, the Court has found that Plaintiff may not maintain claims against \nthe Individual Defendants, for lack of personal jurisdiction .  So it t herefore focuses on C2B here.  \nAs to C2B, Defendants \u2019 primary assertion is  that the FAC lacks allegations that any of C2B\u2019s \nacts interfered with the relevant contractual rights, and, more broadly, that C2B \u201c did anything\u201d  \nwrong here.  (D.I. 43 at 1 8-19)21   \n But this argument is belied by the FAC\u2019s allegations .  (D.I. 44 at 19)  The FAC assert s \nthat:  (1) C2B had knowledge of the rel evant agreements; (2) it took affir mative steps with \nulterior motives to prevent ECB and AVC from paying the Subsequent Installments , such as by \ncausing those parties to sell SFI\u2019s assets to Atalanta and divert ing the proceeds elsewhere or by \ninitiating th e ABC proceedings ; and (3) there was no legal justification for C2B\u2019s wrongf ul acts .  \n(D.I. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 177- 79; see also \u00b6\u00b6 13, 68, 104, 108, 170)  \n 4. Conspiracy Claim (Count VII)  \nCount VII of the FAC alleges conspiracy to commit tortious interference with contract \nagainst the Individual Defendants and C2B.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 181- 87)22  Here again, for reasons \nexplained above, the Court focuses only on C2B here.   \n \n21  To the extent that Defendants argue that the claim fails  because \u201cZausner has no \ncontract rights with which any of the Defendants allegedly interfered[,]\u201d (D.I. 43 at 18), the \nCourt has rejected that argument in Section II.A.   \n \n22  Under Florida law, a civil conspiracy requires:  (1) an agreement between two or  \nmore parties; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means; (3) the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy; and (4) damage to plaintiff as a result.  Eagletech Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Bryn Mawr Inv. Grp., Inc., 79 So. 3d 855, 863 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2012) (citation omitted).  Furthermore, Florida law states that a valid claim must allege an independent underlying illegal act or tort on which the conspiracy is based.  See Carney v. IDI -\nDX, Inc., N o. 2:12- cv-00449- FtM-29DNF, 2013 WL 4080326, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 13, 2013); \nRaimi v. Furlong, 702 So. 2d 1273, 1284 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997). 31 \n As relevant to C2B, Defendants argue that pursuant to Florida law, a civil conspiracy \nclaim must be supported by an underlying wrong, and since here there is no valid claim fo r \ntortious interference, there can be no civil conspiracy claim.  (D.I. 43 at 19)  This is not \npersuasive , however, in light of the Court\u2019s above rejection of Defendants\u2019 argument  for \ndismissal as to Count VI.  (D.I. 44 at 20)   \nD. Motion to Strike  \nLastly, Defendants argue that the Court should strike the FAC\u2019s allegations regarding the \nsale of SFI\u2019s assets and the business affairs of SFI.  (D.I. 43 at 20)   Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(f) states, in relevant part, that a \u201ccourt may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  \u201cThe purpose of a motion to strike is to clean up the pleadings, streamline litigation, and avoid unnecessary forays into i mmaterial matters.\u201d  Sepracor Inc. v. Dey, L.P ., Civil Action No. 06-\n113-JJF, 2008 WL 4377570, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 26, 2008)  (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted) .  Motions to strike are generally disfavored and \u201cusually will be denied unless the \nallegations have no possible relation to the controversy and may cause prejudice to one of the parties.\u201d  Id . (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nDefendants have not demonstrate d that such allegations are \u201credundant , immaterial, \nimpertinent[] or scandalous [.]\u201d  See  Fed.  R. Civ. P.  12(f).  Defendants\u2019 basis for str iking the  \nallegations  is their  argument that only the assignee (here SFI , not Plaintiff ) has standing to \npursue an inquiry regarding the details of the sale of SFI\u2019s assets .  (D.I. 43 at 20)  But t his is not \nan appropriate basis to strike these allegations under Rule 12(f).  See, e.g., Peralta  v. Wonderful  \nCitrus  Packing  LLC , No. 1: 15-cv-00263- TLN -JLT, 2016 WL 726908, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 24, \n2016).  The Court agrees with Plaintiff that the allegations at issue provide relevant context for 32 \n Plaintiff\u2019s claims .  (D.I. 44 at 20)  Therefore, the Court recommends that Defendants\u2019 Rule 12(f) \nrequest  be denied.  \nIII. CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that the motion to dismiss be \nGRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED -IN-PART .
