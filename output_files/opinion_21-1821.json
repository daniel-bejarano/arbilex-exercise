The Court carefully reviewed all \nsubmissions in connection with Defendant\u2019s motion, heard oral argument, and applied the relevant legal standards for review of this type of Section 101-related motion at the pleading stage, which it has previously set out in Genedics , LLC v. Meta Co., Civil Action No. 17-1062-\nCJB, 2018 WL 3991474, at *2-5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2018).    The Court\u2019s Order is consistent with the bench ruling announced at the hearing on December 2 0, 2022,\n1 pertinent excerpts of which follow:  \nThat brings us to our last case today, Topia Technology, Inc., [v.] \nEgnyte, Inc.  It's Civil Action Number 21-1821- CJB.   Defendant \nEgnyte, Inc., which I [ will]  refer to as Defendant, has filed a \nmotion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(c), which I [ will]  refer to as the motion. With \nthe motion, Defendant is asserting that the complaint should be dismissed because the patents -in-suit are  subject -matter ineligible \npursuant to Section 101.    \n \n1  ( See D.I. 68 (hereinafter, \u201cTr.\u201d) ) \n3 \n At the outset, the Court will address a  few procedural issues.    \n \nFirst, there are six patents -in-suit at issue in this case, which are all \nrelevant to  the motion.  For ease of reference here today,  I[ will]  \nrefer to each of the patents by the last  three numbers of their \nrespective [p]atent  [n]umbers.   \n Second, although the motion is brought  here pursuant to [Federal] \nRule  [of Civil Procedure]  12(c), the nature of the  Court \u2019s analysis \nof that motion will not differ  as compared to its analysis of the  \nother  motions it addressed today.  That is because although those \nother motions were brought  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), not Rule \n12(c), the  standard of review for [] Rule 12(c) for  judgment on the \npleadings is the same as that  for deciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions.\n2 \n \nThird, Defendants asserted that [c] laim 1 in each of the  . . .  \nrespective patents is  representative of all the other claims of those  \npatents for purposes of Section 101 analysis at  issue here.3  In its \nanswering brief, Plaintiff Topia  Technology, Inc., which I [ will]  \nrefer t o as Plaintiff, never really contests that  assertion.  Although \nat one point in its  briefing, Plaintiff makes a quick reference to the \ncontent of two dependent claims, that is, [c] laim 5 of the '942 \npatent and [c]laim 4 of the  '607 patent,4 it does so only to show \nwhy the  content of those claims are similar in kind to  the content \nof [c] laim 1 of those respective  patents.   The [United States Court \nof Appeals for the] Federal Circuit has held, as I [ have] noted, that \nCourts may treat a claim as  representative if the patentee does not \npresent  any meaningful argument for the distinctive  significance of \nany claim limitations not found  in the representative claim.5  In \nlight of this,  herein, the Court will primarily only address  [c]laim 1 \nof each of the respective patents -in-suit, understanding for our  \npurposes  here that [c]laim 1 of the patent is  representative of all the \nclaims of that same  patent.   \n \nFourth, because each of the six patents  are related, they largely \nshare the s ame specification with only a few differences.   Today, \n \n2  Kaavo Inc. v. Cognizant Tech. Sols. Corp., Civil Action No. 14- 1192- LPS-CJB, \nCivil Action No. 14- 1193- LPS-CJB, 2016 WL 476730, at *2 n.4 (D. Del. Feb. 5, 2016).   \n \n3  (D.I. 40 at 4- 11) \n \n4  (D.I. 45 at 11- 12)   \n \n5  Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 4 when I make reference to the specification, unless [I] indicate \notherwise, I [ will] be referring to the specification of the '561 \npatent.  When I do so, it should be understood that the specifications of all five other  patents are the same in th[at]  \nrespect, again  unless I advise specifically to the contrary.  \nA\nnd fifth, for reasons that will become clearer shortly, I [ am] \ngoing to address the patents- in-suit in four distinct groupings, as \nthe Court's decisions . . . will differ depending on which grouping of patents is at issue.   \nT\nhe first grouping I [ will]  address is  actually a grouping of one [:]  \nthe '561 patent.  The patent is titled \u201c Architecture for  Management \nof Digital Files Across a  Distributed Network.\u201d   \nIn\n [s]tep 1, D efendant  argues that this patent, and indeed all six \npatents -in-suit today, are directed to an abstract idea that \nDefendant refers to in  similar, if slightly different terms,  \nthroughout the briefing.  Defendant  alternat ively refers to this \nabstract idea as  \u201cstoring and synchronizing versions of documents \nand other files\u201d or \u201csynchronizing multiple versions of a file across network computers\u201d or \u201csynchronizing document versions \u201d or \n\u201cautomatically transferring modified files  and information across \nmultiple generic  computer systems\u201d or \u201c automatically  transferring \nmodified electronic files to  network devices.\u201d\n6  I understand \nDefendant to  treat each of these slightly different  articulations of \nthe abstract idea as  carrying  the same basic meaning.  So for ease \nof reference, I [ will]  utilize \u201csynchronizing multiple versions of the \nfile across network computers\u201d as the shorthand for the abstract idea at issue here.  \nP\nlaintiff, for its part, does[ not] dispute that synchroniz ing multiple \nversions of a file across network computers is an abstract idea,  \nand the Court agrees that it is.  Again, in the parlance of the Federal Circuit, it appears to  be a disembodied concept or a basic \nbuilding block of human ingenuity untethered fr om any  real-world \napplication.\n7  \nP\nlaintiff contends at [s]tep 1, however, that the claims of the '561 \npatent are directed not to the abstract idea but, instead, are \u201cdirected to a specific computer network architecture for a useful \n6( D.I. 40 at 2, 15-16) \n7  CLS Bank Int\u2019l v. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd., 717 F.3d 1269, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2013) \n(Lourie, J., concurring). 5 and improved file management system that includes a  dedicated \nsoftware system configured to automatically provide the user with  \nthe most recent version of the file to be accessed from  any of the \nuser's devices.\u201d8  Plaintiff contends that the claims of all the \npatents are directed  to that more specific concept.   Plaintiff goes on \nto address what each  patent is individually directed to more  \nspecifically in light of the specification.  \nAs \nI noted earlier today, in order to determine what a claim really \nis directed to, the Fe deral  Circuit explained that the Court should \nconsult both the claim language and the specification.  In doing so, it becomes clear that [c]laim 1 of  the '561 patent is directed to the \nabstract  idea at issue.   \nT\nurning first to the text of [c] laim 1, it does seem that the focus of \nthat claim is on a  high-level concept of synchronizing multiple \nversions of a file across network computers.9  Nearly the entirety \nof the claim \u2019s text could be said to be devoted to this general  \nconcept.   The claim explains that, first, the system requires the use \nof a first electronic device,  a second electronic device, and a third  \nelectronic device, each associated with a user.   Each of those three \ndevices must contain an  application.  The claim then explains how \nthe second  device\u2019 s application  [1] automatically transfers a  copy \nof the first electronic file from the  second device to the first device \nat the point where the user modified the content of that first file and [2] how it does so upon determining that a sav e operation has \nbeen performed on the file.  Next, the claim explains that the first \ndevice is also configured to automatically  receive a copy of a \nsecond electronic file from  a third device\u2019s application at the point \nwhen  the user modifies the content of that file.  Then the claim \nnotes that the first device \u2019s application is configured to  \nautomatically  transfer the modified version of the copy of the first \nfile to the third device in order to replace an older version of that file.  And the claim also states that the fist device  automatically \ntransfers a copy of the second file to the second device in order to replace an older version of that file. \nS\nimply by laying out how [c] laim 1  describes the claimed system, \none can see that  the focus of nearly the ent ire claim is on the  \nconcept of automatically transferring computer files from one electronic device to another so  that the respective three devices all \ncontain  the same modified and updated versions of those files.  Put \n8( D.I. 45 at 4) \n9(' 561 patent, cols. 10:45-11:9) 6 differently,  the claim reads  as if it is a ll about the  abstract idea a t \nissue [\u2014]synchronizi ng multiple versions of a file across network \ncomputers[\u2014]and not on some more specific or particularized  real-\nworld application of that idea.  As Defendant notes, the claim[] \nuses \u201chighly generalized, r esult-o riented terms[;]\u201d [i]ts focus \nseems to be not on explaining in any d etail how  these file transfers \nare to be accomplished, but instead simply conveying the \n\u201caspirational result of automatically transferring updated versions\u201d \nof the file in the first place.10 \nThe specification only further supports this conclusion. \nThe [ A]bstract and  the [S]ummary of the [I]nvention section of the \npatent11 describe  what the patent is said to be all about.  I n doing \nso, those sections simply parrot back the content of [c]laim 1,  \nnothing more.   \nThe content [of the B ]ackground of the [I]nvention section also \nsupports Defendant \u2019s position.  Therein, the patentee explained the \nproblems in the prior art that the  patent [ means] to solve.  H ere, t he \npatent notes that conventional computing systems allow for users\u2019 \nvarious devices to be easily connected, but that such systems had \ndrawbacks in that \u201cthey do not provide the customer a seamless \nenvironment \u201d in tha t \u201cthe customer must manually handle many \naspects of  that conn ection[ ]\u201d [a] nd th[ at] as to file management, \ncustomers mus t \u201cmanually move files between t heir de vices \u201d using \nvarious protocols.12  The patent further expounds on these  \nproblems, which include [1] the proliferation of redundant file \ncopies, [ 2] the proliferation of an error-prone environment, and [ 3] \nunnecessary complexity.13 \nThe patent then describes a number of possible solutions in the art \nto this problem that, for one reason or another, are not satisfactory.  \nThese include remote desktop s oftware [(]which is pr oblematic \nbecause it [did] not []  utilize the local r esources of  a client \n[device)] ; distributed f ile systems [ (] which have drawbacks,  \nincluding that the customer always had to be connected to the \n10(D.I. 40 at 15) \n11('561 patent at 1 & col. 3:42-61) \n12(Id., col. 1:31-36; see also id ., c ol. 1:59-62) \n13(Id., col. 1:38-58) 7 \n system and that accessing files in  the system  tended to be a slow \nprocess [)]; FTP  [(] which in  addition to sharing some of the same \nproblems  as distributed file systems also had the  problem that the \ncustomer was required to  manually use client software to perform \nthe operations of a distri buted file system as a  separate task [)]; e -\nmail [(]which was \u201c even worse than FTP because the process is \neven more  manual \u201d [in that,] among other reasons [,] the customer \nhas [to] find an e -mail message  containing a file before  [he] can \n[even] access the file [)]; and flash drives or external disk drives  \n[(]which had the downside that they had to be  \u201cphysically \nconnected to the computer on which the files would be \naccessed \u201d[).]14 \n \nIn other words, in this portion of the  specification, the patentee  \nseems to be explaining that the claims are meant to allow  for \nautomatically  transferring computer files  between devices, which \nwas an improvement over  the art because at least certain of these \nprior  art options [] require the user to perform  a [similar] solution \nmanually  in a more burdensome way.  However, the Federal \nCircuit has made  clear that the mere automation of otherwise  \nmanual processes using generic computers does  not constitute a \npatentable improvement in computer technology.15  In The \nUniversity of  Florida Research Foundation, Inc. [v.] General \nElectric, Inc., for example, the  Federal Circuit noted that when a \npatent \u2019s claims simply seek to automate an otherwise  manual \nmethodology in order to conserve human resources and minimize \nerrors, this  demonstrates th at the patent is a  \u201cquintessential \u2018 do it \non a computer \u2019 patent [,]\u201d [whose] claims are directed to an abstract \nidea.16    \n Moreover, it would seem hard for the  [P]laintiff to contest that \n[c]laim 1 of the '561 patent is directed to merely automatically  \nsynchronizing multiple versions of the file  across network \ncomputers [,] because in its  [C]omplaint, Plaintiff essentially said \nas much.   There, Plaintiff stated that the '561 patent is  \u201cgenerally \n \n14   (Id., cols. 2:10- 3:34)  \n \n15  Credit Acceptance Corp. v. Westlake Servs ., 859 F.3d 1044, 1055 (Fed Cir. 2017). \n \n16  Univ. of Fla. Research Found., Inc. v. General Elec. Co., 916 F.3d 1363, 1367 \n(Fed. Cir. 2019) (citation omitted) ; see also Cellspin Soft, Inc. v. Fitbit, Inc., 927 F.3d 1306, \n1315- 16 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (finding claims directed to the idea of \u201ccapturing and transmitting data \nfrom one device to another\u201d to be patent ineligible, and rejecting the patentee\u2019s argument that the claims recited technological improvements where the claims merely automated the process of data transfer) . 8 \n directed to systems and methods for  sharing electronic files \nbetween multiple  devices, for even when a user modifies an  \nelectronic file on a device, a copy of the  modified electronic file is \nautomatically  transferred to at least one other device. \u201d17  The  \nCourt is hard- pressed to see much daylight  between that  \ndescription and Defendant \u2019s articulation of the abstract idea at \nissue  here.  \n \nI now turn to [s]tep 2 of the Alice  framework.  As I noted earlier, at \n[s]tep 2 the  Court is required to assess what else is in the  claim \nbeyond the abstract idea and whether  those additional elements can \namount to an [\u201c] inventive concept,[\u201d]  such that they transform the  \nnature of the claim into a patent -eligible application of the abstract \nidea.  \n \nHere, however, it [ is] hard to see what more  there is in [c] laim 1 of \nthis patent be yond those  things that relate to the abstract idea itself.  \nAll or nearly all of the claim\u2019 s language seems  to be focused on the \ngeneral concept of  automatically transferring modified electronic  \nfiles between network devices [.]  [A]nd Plaintiff  did not add \nallegations to its [C]omplaint that  address [] the [Section] 101 \nquestion at [s]t ep 2 in a  manner that might suggest otherwise.  \n Nor is there anything about any hardware  [(]such as the respective \ndevices referenced by  [c]laim 1 [,] or the nature of the computer \nsystem  itself [)], or any software  [(]such as the claimed  files or \napplications in the claims [)], that  appear to amount to the inventive \nconcept here.   The patent, as Defendant noted, makes clear  that \nexemplary systems for implementing the  invention simply include \na \u201cgeneral purpose  computing device \u201d\n18 and that \u201c [e]mbodiments \nof the  invention are operational with numerous other  general \npurpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.\u201d\n19 \n In support of its argument for patent eligibility, Plaintiff argued in part that the  claim does not preempt the field of  synchronizing \nelectronic files across multiple  systems[,]\n20 because the patent, as \nI[ have]  already  discussed, distinguishes between the s ystem in  \n \n17  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6  12) \n \n18  ('561 patent, col. 5:15- 16) \n \n19  (Id., col. 4:57- 59; see also  D.I. 45 at 5)  \n \n20  (D.I. 45 at 16)  9 \n [c]laim 1 and other conventional approaches, at  least some of \nwhich tended to rely on the  user \u2019s manual  work in order to update \nthe respective files.21  Since there remain available alternatives, \naccording to the [P]laintiff, the  \u201cclaims do not preempt every \napplication of the  alleged abstract idea. \u201d22  The problem, however, \nfor Plaintiff here  as it relates to the '561 patent particularly  is that \nin order to survive at [s]tep 2, a  plaintiff cannot simply rely on \ngeneric computer elements to carry  out an abstract idea \n[\u201c]automatically. [\u201d]  If a claim \u2019s only inventive  concept is the \napplication of an abstract idea using conventional and well -\nunderstood techniques, the claim has simply not been transformed \ninto a patent -eligible application  of an abs tract idea.23  As the \nFederal Circuit  has noted, where a patent \u2019s claims are deemed  only \nto disclose patent -ineligible subject matter under the Alice \nframe []work, as they are  as to this patent, preemption[] concerns \nare fully addressed and made moot.24 \n Plaintiff additionally argues in [s]tep 2  that prior to 2007, there \n\u201cwas no computer  network architecture using a server between  \ndifferent user devices to perform automatic  file synchronization \nwhenever a user modifies a  file on a device associated with a file  \nmanagement system. \u201d\n25  But in the Court's view, that [ is] simply \nanother way of saying the claimed  system was new in the relevant \ntime frame.  As  the Federal Circuit has noted, eligibility and  \nnovelty are separate inquiries .  Simply because  the claime d system \nmay have been novel does not  mean that it will survive Alice's \ntest.26 \n Finally, the Court takes a moment to  address some of the cases \ncited by both sides. First, the Court agrees with Defendant that the  \n'561 patent is similar to the claims at issue  in Ameranth, Inc. \n[v.]Domino's Pizza, a  Federal Circuit case [and]  a case the \n[D]efendant  called out as the most similar to the  challenged \n \n21   (Id.) \n \n22  (Id.) \n \n23  BSC Tech LLC v. Buyseasons, Inc ., 899 F.3d 1281, 1290- 91 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \n \n24  Two-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast Cable Commc\u2019ns, LLC , 874 F.3d 1329, 1339 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017).  \n \n25  (D.I. 45 at 19)  \n \n26  Two-Way Media Ltd., 874 F.3d at 1339- 40. 10 \n conduct here.  In that case, the  Federal Circuit found th[e]  claims [,] \nwhich were directed to  [\u201c]configuring and transmitting  hospitality -\nmenu -related information using a  system that[ is] capable of \nsynchronous  communications and automatic format [ting\u201d]  were  \ndirected to an abstract idea at [s]tep 1, in part  because the claims \nprovided only result -focused  and functi onal language [,] without \nsetting out the  specifics  of a particular conception [of how to]  \nactually carr [y] out th[at]  concept.27  At [s]tep 2, the Federal \nCircuit concluded that the claims  did not include an inventive \nconcept because they did no more than \u201c instruct the  practitioner to \nimplement the abstract idea,  which was routine, conventional \nactivity. \u201d28  As I[ have]  just described, the representative claim  \nof the '561 patent seems just like the  representative claims in \nAmeranth.  It relies  on routine computer elements [] to simply  \ncarry out the abstract idea at issue.    \n \nPlaintiff, in identifying what it thought  was the most analogous \ncase in [its]  supplemental  letter brief, actually picked [a]  case that \nit had not cited in its [earlier] brie fing[,] and [that] instead [had \nbeen decided] after the briefing closed [:]  Cooperative  \nEntertainment  [v.] Kollective Technology, Inc., another Federal \nCircuit case.29  Ironically, the Court concludes that this case  is, in \nfact, as to the '561 patent, more  helpful for Defendant than it is for \nPlaintiff.   In Cooperative Entertainment , the district court had \nruled that the claims in the  patent at issue were directed to the \nabstract  idea of the preparation and transmission of  content to \npeers through a computer network.30  The Federal Circuit reversed, \nconcluding at  [s]tep 2 that the claims could contain inventive  \nconcepts.  This is because the claims did more  than merely \nimplement the abstract idea with  generic computer components \nusing conventiona l technology.31  Importantly, unlike as to the '561 \npatent  here, there was evidence in the record in  Cooperative \nEntertainment to support that  conclusion.  The Cooperative \nEntertainment  Court found there were at least two limitations  in \nthe claims [ (]one t hat required a dynamic  peer -to-peer network \n \n27   Ameranth, Inc. v. Domino\u2019s Pizza, LLC , 792 Fed App\u2019x 780, 786- 87 (Fed. Cir. \n2019).  \n28  Id. at 787.  \n \n29  (D.I. 62 at 1)  \n \n30  Coop. Entm\u2019t, Inc. v. Kollective Tech., Inc., 50 F.4th 127, 131 (Fed. Cir. 2022) . \n \n31  Id. 11 \n wherein multiple nodes  consume [d] the same content and were \nconfigured to communicate outside [of] content distribution  \nnetworks, and another that r equired the use of trace routes in \ncontent segmentation [)] that  potentially amounted to inventive \nconcepts [.]  [A]nd the Court explained how the specification and \nthe operative complaint  discussed these  limitations in significant \ndetail, articulating  how their inclusion of the claims amounted to \nan improvement to the computer technology that  was in the prior \nart.32  Here, while the specification does  discuss how the claimed \ninvention amounts to an improvement over the prior [] art, the \nclaimed  content [at] issue involves only the use of generic  and \nconventional computer  components, it seems, to effectuate the  \nabstract idea contained in the claims.  There [ is] no showing here \nin the patent or in the  operative complaint that anything in [c] laim \n1 amounts to the [requisite] inventive  concept.  \n For all these reasons, the Court finds  that the motion should be \ngranted as to the  claims relating to the '561 patent.   \n The Court now turns to the second grouping, again a grouping of one[:]  the '942 patent.  The '942 patent, whose title is the same as \nthe '561 patent, is otherwise also very similar to the '561 patent. The only identified key difference between the two as  described by \nPlaintiff in [its]  answering brief  on pages 4 and 11 [,]\n33 is the fact \nthat [c] laim 1 of  the '942 patent additionall y requires that the  \nclaimed systems determine [] whether the respective devices are in \ncommunication with  each other before sending an electronic file \nfrom one device to the other.34  Claim 5, which  ultimately depends \nfrom [c] laim 1, relatedly  requires that the modified first file is \n[\u201c]stored  on [the]  memory device associated with the first  \nelectronic device responsive to a determination  that the first \nelectronic device is not in  communication with the third electronic \ndevice. [\u201d]35  For ease of reference, I [ will] refer to these  claim \nlimitations as the  [\u201c]determining [\u201d] steps []or  elements.  \n Claim 1 of the '942 patent does not  appear materially different to \nthe Court from a  Section 101 perspective as compared to [c] laim 1  \n \n32   Id. at 131- 35. \n \n33   (D.I. 45 at 4, 11)  \n \n34  ('942 patent, col. 11:3- 9) \n \n35  (Id., col. 11:59- 63) 12 \n of the '561 patent.  Indeed, I note that on page 17 of Plaintiff \u2019s \nanswering brief, Plaintiff lumped together these two patents for  \npurposes of its eligibility analysis.36 \n \nPlaintiff nevertheless argues that the  determining steps are features \nthat are \u201c additional non[ -]abstract improvements \u201d as they  \u201care \nnecessarily rooted in computer technology because they focus on addressing computer [ ]network[ -]centric issues related to \n[]network unavailability.\u201d\n37  The rem [a]inder of  Plaintiff's [s]tep 1 \nargument, however, simply restates the wording of the elements recited in  [c]laims 1 and 5 that I [ have]  just described.\n38  \n \nWhile the claim [ed] determining steps in the  '942 patent do involve \nthe use of computer  technology, that bare fact alone does not  \nrequire that the outcome of the eligibility  analysis be any different.  \n \nAt [s]tep 1, plaintiff has pointed to nothing in the '942 patent \nsuggesting that these determining steps  are actually what the \nclaims are directed to.   The '942 patent specification, including the  \n[A]bstract and the [S]ummary of the [I]nvention section, are \nessentially the same as that of  the '561 patent.  And while the \n[A]bstract and  [S]ummary of the [I] nvention section of the patent  \ndo note that the devices in the claimed invention a re \u201cin \ncommunication \u201d with each  other, they never suggest the step of  \ndetermining whether such communication exists  is central to the \nfocus of the patent or its  claims.39 \n Moreover, the concept that two devices  actually must be in \ncommunication with each  other before one transfers an electronic \nfile to the other appears to the Court to be one  that is fairly \nconsidered to be part of the  abstract idea itself.  After all, one \ncannot  synchronize multiple versions of a file across  networ k \ncomputers if those computers are [ not] in  communication with \neach other in the first  place.  \n As for [s]tep 2, Plaintiff did not make any arguments there that were specific to the '942  patent \u2019s determining steps.  There[ is] \nnothing in the record to sugge st that the inclusion of the  steps \n \n36   (D.I. 45 at 17)  \n \n37  (Id. at 11)  \n \n38  (Id.) \n \n39  ('942 patent  at 1 & col. 3:50- 4:2) 13 \n would transform [c] laim 1 into one  amounting to the  \nunconventional use of  technology to solve a problem in the \ncomputer  arts[,] such that the steps would help make up an  \ninventive concept.   \n \nThus, for the same reasons  as the '561 patent, the Court concludes \nthat the '942 patent is also directed to patent -ineligible subject \nmatter.  The motion should be granted as to the claims relating to that patent as well.  \n The next grouping of patents I [ will] discuss  are th e '787 and '823 \npatents.  Claim 1 of  these patents is similar to [c] laim 1 of the '561 \n[p]atent [,] in the sense that all are claims to  systems that \nautomatically transfer files  between multiple devices after a user \nmodifies  those files [.]  [B]ut the respective claims also  have some \ndifferences which, in the Court \u2019s view, will turn out to be material.  \n Specifically, [c]laim 1 of the '787 patent  additionally requires that \nafter a user  modifies an electronic file on a device, the first \nmetadata associated with  that file must be assigned a first priority \nthat is greater  than a second priority assigned to the copy of  \nthe file itself.  And the claim requires that,  based on the fact that \nthis metadata has a higher priority than a copy of the file itself,  \nthe metadata is automatically transferred from a first device to a second device before the  copy of that file is transferred to the \nsecond device.   Moreover, the claim requires that when  this \nmetadata is transferred to the second  device, this causes a file \nrepresentation of  the file on that second device to be updated  \nbased on that metadata.  And it requires that  this now -updated file \nrepresentation represents  the updated version of the file stored on \nthe first device that is not currently stored on the seco nd device.\n40 \n \nAs for [c]laim 1 of the '823 patent, it has  similar language to \n[c]laim 1 of the '787 patent [,] except that the transfer of the \nmetadata to the  second device causes a graphical availability  \nindication of the updated version of the file  to be presented on the \nsecond device based on that metadata[,] and that this graphical  \navailability indication is presented proximate  to the file icon \nrepresenting that file.  And the claim requires that the graphical  \navailability indication indicates that th e updated version of the file \nis available to be  downloaded to the second device.41 \n \n \n40  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 55;  see also  '787 patent, col . 11:09-55) \n \n41  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 67;  see also  '823 patent, col . 11:10- 61)   14 \n At [s]tep 1, the Court does [not] think it [ is] correct as a legal \nmatter to conclude that these two patents are directed simply to the  \nbare abstract idea that Defendant has pu t forward.  The Court so \nconcludes for a few  reasons.  \n \nFirst, Defendant's proposed abstract  idea[ (] again, synchronizing \nmultiple versions of  the file across network computers [)] does not  \ninclude a concept that seems key to these patents, that is, that certain metadata related  to the file must get transferred to the \ndevice before  the copy of the electronic file gets  transferred to the \ndevice.  A significant  portion of [c] laim 1 of both the patents \ndiscuss this requirement and how this transferred metadat a and this \nprioritization over the file  copy itself otherwise impacts the  \nsynchronization process.  Surely one could synchronize multiple \nversions of a file across  network computers without  utilizing this \ntype of prioritized metadata process.  So this  meta data- related \naspect of the claims has to be viewed as something narrower [than] and really  distinct from the broad abstract idea itself.  \n Moreover, these two patents provide a  number of other clues that \nwhatever the claims  are directed to, that concept has  to include  \nreference to the system \u2019s utilization of  prioritized metadata.  For \none thing, look at  the patent titles.  The title of the '787 patent is \n\u201cPre[-]File[-]Transfer Update Based on  Prioritized Metadata. \u201d  \nAnd the title of the  '823 patent is \"Pre [-]File Transfer Availability  \nIndication Based on Prioritized Metadata. \u201d  It is permissible to \nlook at a patent \u2019s title in  assessing what a claim is directed to,\n42 \nand here  the titles emphasize that you simply can [not] articulate \nwhat these patents are all about  without including some reference \nto the claimed  system and method\u2019s use of prioritized metadata. \nDespite this, Defendant \u2019s abstract  idea does not mention this \nconcept.  \n Additionally, the [A]bstract and [S]ummary of  the [I] nvention \nsections of these two patents  also support Plaintiff \u2019s position at \n[s]tep 1.  Unlike with the other four patents -in-suit, these key \nsections of the '787 and '823 patents  make prominent reference to \nthe importance of  the use of prioritized metadata in file  \nsynchronization.    \n [Now, a] s the Court will note in a  moment, what these patents and \nother patents -in-suit are a little less clear about is exactly how it is  \nthat the use of the  prioritized metadata actually helps to improve  \n \n42   Endo Pharm., Inc. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., 919 F.3d 1347, 1353 (Fed. Cir. \n2019). 15 \n computer functionality.  There is some discussion of that, as I [ \nwill]  explain, though not  a lot.  Nevertheless, the [s] tep 1 inquiry \nasks what is the focus of these claims.  Given that  it[ is] clear that \nthese two patents are focused  in significant part o n transferring \nmetadata prior to the transfer of electronic files, the  Court cannot \nconclude that the claims are simply directed to the much broader \nabstract  idea of synchronization of multiple versions of  the file \nacross network devices.   \n So for that  reason, the Court will deny Defendant's motion at [s]tep \n1 as to the '787 and '823 patents.\n43 \n \nFinally, the Court turns to the last  patent grouping, the '607 and \n'622 patents.  These patents, which share the same title as  the '561 \npatent, seem to fall somewh ere between  the '561 patent on the one \nhand and the '787 and '823 patents on the other as it relates to the \nSection 101 calculus.  \n \nLike the '787 and '823 patents, the '607 and '622 patents do include in their respective [c]laim 1s, among other things, the concept that  \nmetadata about a file must be transferred to a location prior to the \ntransfer of the  electronic file itself.  For example, [c]laim 1  of the \n'607 [patent]  is a system claim that requires  after a user modifies \nan electronic file on a device firs t metadata is generated relating to  \nthe file.  The system automatically transfers  that metadata to a \nsecond device prior to the  copy of the file being transferred to that \nsame device.\n44  And [c] laim 1 of the '622 patent has a  similar \nrequirement.45 \n \nUnlike  the '787 and '823 patents, however, the title of the patent \ndid not make  reference to the claim \u2019s use of prioritized  \nmetadata with respect to file tran s[fer].  Nor did the patent \u2019s \n[A]bstract or [S]ummary of the  [I]nvention section [s] discuss this \nconcept .  Instead, the content of the '607 and '622 patent \nspecification is essentially the same as  the content of the '561 \npatent specification.  \n \n \n43   Sunoco Partners Mktg. & Terminals L.P. v. Powder Springs Logistics, LLC , Civil \nAction No. 17- 1390- LPS-CJB, 2019 WL 4466766, at *10 (D. Del. Sept. 18, 2019)  (stating that it \nis Defendant\u2019s burden to articulate an abstract idea that correctly characterizes the claim at issue and that failure to do so is a sufficient basis to deny the motion).  \n44  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 44; see also  '607 patent, cols. 10:59- 11:25)  \n \n45  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 77; see also  '622 patent, cols. 10:60- 11:24)  16 \n So at Alice  [s]tep 1, although the claims of the  '607 and '622 \npatents do seem to make some  prominent use of prioritized \nmetadata, it [ is] much more difficult to say here than it was as to \nthe '787 and '823 patents that these claims  are directed to  a system \nthat must include this  concept.  \n \nIn such a circumstance, where there[ is] a close call as to what a \nclaim is directed to at  [s]tep 1, the Federal Circuit noted in Enfish  \n[LLC v. Microsoft Corp.]46 that an analysis of whether there are \narguably concrete improvements in the recited computer  \ntechnology may better take place [] at [s]tep 2 [.]  [S]o the Court \nwill go  that route here as to these two patents.  \n At [s]tep 2, however, the Court believes  there is just enough in the \nrecord to suggest a  plausible factual dispute about whether these  \npatents in fact contain an inventive concept.  Therefore, for that reason, the Court will deny Defendant \u2019s motion as to the '607 and \n'622 patents.   More specifically, there is at least  one portion of the patents \u2019 \ncommon specification that appears to discuss how this  use of \nmetadata can play a helpful role in  solving the problems relating to \nfile synchronization that are discussed in the  patent.\n47  According \nto the specification, a common problem experienced by distributed \nfile systems  and FTP for example [\u2014]two prior art options that  the \npatent derides [\u2014]was a \u201clatency \u201d problem.   That is, the delay \n\u201cbetween a file being put  onto a file system and its showing up on \na remote machine. \u201d48  In explaining how the patent  helps solve this \nproblem, the specification notes that \u201c [i]n an embodiment the user  \ninterfaces [] may include a l ist of the customer \u2019s documents and \nrelated metadata[,] as well as any  one-to-one or one -to-many \nrelationships between  the documents and metadata \u201d49 and it \ndescribes  how, for example, an \u201c embodiment directory\u201d [(] which \nthe Court understands from Plaintiff \u2019s counsel \u2019s statements at oral \nargument to be a  particular type of metadata[)] can be \u201c decoupled \nfrom the [movement of]  files \u201d such that the \u201c directory  update \nsystem updates at a higher priority than the documents [to] be  \n \n46   822 F.3d 1327, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \n \n  47  (D.I. 45 at 13- 14, 17 -19)   \n \n48  ('561 patent,  col. 8:61- 64)    \n \n49  (Id., col. 8:55- 58) 17 \n synchronized. \u201d50  Although the patent \u2019s language here is  far from \ncomplete , the Court thinks it can see  how the patent [] is describing \nhow the  prioritization of metadata over the file copy  \nitself and the sending of that metadata to a  device before the file \ncopy is said to hel p overcome latency issues.  Plaintiff \u2019s counsel  \nexplained today that one way that it does so is  by alerting the user \nto a modification of a  file more quickly prior to the file copy itself  \nbeing received by the device.  \n \nAdditionally, as I noted, at column 1 and 2, the patent describes negatively certain  prior art file synchronization options.  As I  \nnoted, among those are remote desktop software  and distributed \nfile systems.  Today, Plaintiff's counsel argued that it may be  \ncorrect to view those solut ions as a type of  automated or \nsynchronized method of updating files across network devices.   In \nother words, that those two solutions are other unclaimed  \napproaches that can be taken in the realm of  the abstract idea at \nissue.  I can [not]  say that  Plaintiff is wrong to characterize these  \nsolutions as automated solutions in this way, so this could be some evidence that the claimed  solution does not significantly preempt \nthe field of the abstract idea, which would also relevant evidence at \n[s]tep 2.  \n Now, th e Court acknowledges that the  patent says little more about \nhow the prioritization of metadata and the file  synchronization \nprocess can amount to an  inventive concept in the computer \nspace[.]  [B]u t this is the pleading stage.  And in the Court \u2019s view, \nthis record information is just  sufficient to at least create a fact \nissue as  to whether the '607 and '622 patents can meet  [s]tep 2 \u2019s \nrequirement by way of their reliance on prioritized metadata in the claimed file  transfer process.  \n \nThus, for all the reasons that I [ have]  set out, the Court finds the \n'561 and '942 patents  are directed to patent -ineligible subject \nmatter based on the record before me and will  grant the motion \nbased on those patents.  The Court will otherwise deny the motion \nas to remain der of the patents [-]in[-]suit.  \n \n \n \n50  (Id., col. 8:64- 67) "}
