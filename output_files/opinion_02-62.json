BRUCE STEWART , \n \n   Defendant.  ) \n) ) ) \n) ) ) ) \n)  \n   Crim. Actio n No. 02-62 (MN)  \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 7th  day of September 2022; \nPending before the Court is the motion of Defendant, Bruce Stewart, for Compassionate \nRelease Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7  3582(c)(1)(A)(i).  (D.I. 261).  Section 3582(c)(1)(A)(i) empowers \nthe Court to modify a term of imprisonment when \u201cextraordinary and compelling reasons warrant \nsuch a reduction\u201d after considering sentencing factors under \u00a7 3553.  Mr. Stewart contends that \nhis sentence should be reduced  because of (1) his post -sentencing rehabilitation; (2) being \nvictimized by an attempted prison rape; and (3) the threat to his health posed by COVID-19.  The government opposes Mr. Stewart\u2019s motion. ( See D.I.  278, 279). \nI. BACKGROUND \nMr. Stewart is 48 years  old.  In September of 2003, a j ury convicted him of multiple counts \nof drug trafficking, interstate travel in aid of racketeering, and attempted money laundering.  The \nGuidelines range for Mr. Stewart were 30 years to life in prison.  In April of 2005, Mr. Stewart \nwas sentenced to life in prison .  He has been detained in federal custody since May 31, 2002, and \nthus has served just over 20 years of his se ntence.   \nOn April 24, 2021, Mr. Stewart submitted a request for compassionate release pursuant to \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)(i) to the Warden of his current institution, FCC Pollock.  That request 2 was denied  on May 11, 2021.  Mr. Stewart then filed a  motion in this Court pro se  seeking \ncompassionate release.  ( D.I. 261).  Thereafter, the Court appointed the Federal Public Defender  \n(D.I. 264) to represent Mr. Stewart and , on January 28, 2022, counsel filed a new brief in support \nof Mr. Stewart\u2019s motion for compassionate release (D.I. 275).   The motion has been fully briefed.  \n(D.I. 275, 278, 279, 281, 282). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201c\u2018[A] judgment of conviction that includes [a sentence of imprisonment] constitutes a final \njudgment\u2019 and may not be modified by a district court except in limited circumstances.\u201d   Dillon v. \nUnited States , 560 U.S. 817, 825 (2010).  One of those circumstanc es is compassionate release, \nwhich requires administrative exhaustion followed by a showing that \u201cextraordinary and \ncompelling reasons warrant such a reduction\u201d and a finding that the statutory sentencing factors at \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (\u201c\u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d ) support release.   See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A), \n(c)(1)(A)(i); United States v. Pawlowski , 967 F.3d 327, 330 (3d Cir. 2020).  \u201cCompassionate \nrelease is discretionary, not mandatory; therefore, even if a defendant is eligible for it, a district court may deny compassionate release upon determining that a sentence reduction would be inconsistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d  United States v. Fountain, 2021 WL 4772957, at *1 \n(3d Cir. 2021) (internal citations omitted) (unpublished).  As the movant, a defendant bears the \nburden to establish that he or she is eligible for a sentence reduction.  United States v. Jones , \n836 F.3d 896, 899 (8th Cir. 2016); United States v. Green, 764 F.3d 1352, 1356 (11th Cir. 2014). \nThe Sentencing Commission has issued a policy sta tement addressing  compassionate \nrelease.   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.13 (\u201cthe Policy Statement\u201d).  The Policy Statement largely restricts \n\u201cextraordinary and compelling reasons\u201d to: (1) terminal illness or a serious medical condition; (2) complications in old age; and (3) unique family circumstances.  Id. at n.1.  In United States v. \nAndrews , the Third Circuit held that the Policy Statement is not binding on prisoner -initiated 3 motions for relief, but \u201csheds light on the meaning of extraordinary and compelling reasons.\u201d \n12 F.4th 255, 260 (3d Cir. 2021) (\u201c Andrews \u201d).  Indeed, in concluding that the Policy Statement is \nnot per se  binding, the Third Circuit noted that: \u201cBecause Congress reenacted the compassionate-\nrelease statute without any alterations to the phrase \u201cextraord inary and compelling reasons,\u201d it was \nreasonable . . . to conclude that the phrase largely retained the meaning it had under the previous \nversion of the statute.\u201d  Id. at 260. \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nAs already noted, Mr. Stewart advances three reasons that he argues  constitute \n\u201cextraordinary and compelling\u201d factors that demand his early release from prison: (1) his post -\nsentencing rehabilitation; (2) being victimized by an attempted prison rape; and (3) the threat to his health posed by COVID-19.  (D.I. 275 at 7).  The Court addresses each issue in turn. \nA. Rehabilitation  \nAccording to his presentence report, prior to his incarceration, Mr. Stewart was a drug \ntrafficking brute, who used fear and intimidation to get what he wanted.  He evidenced little compassion for the needs of others.  In fact, at that time, i f you disappointed Mr. Stewart  there was \na good possibility you would end up dead.  The Court does not point this out to retread old ground, \nbut to show that some of the changes described in Mr. Stewart\u2019s motion are quite noteworthy.  Indeed, it appears that Mr. Stewart has endeavored to improve himself  during his incarceration.  \nHe has participated (and done well) in three rigorous programs  while in prison: (1) the Ch allenge 4 Program;1 (2) the Inmate Suicide Watch Companion Program;2 and (3) the Mental  Health \nCompanion Program.  His actions during those programs earned him  positive reviews  and high \ngrades .   \nMoreover, during his incarceration, Mr. Stewart appears to h ave learned to look beyond \nhimself  and to pay attention to the needs of others.  The Court has re ad Mr. Stewart\u2019s letter in \nwhich he looks back on himself as \u201cyoung, selfish, ignorant and suffer[ing] from an anti -social \ndisorder\u201d  and reflects on the hard work and discipline he had to put in to change his outlook.  The \nCourt has also read the many pages of character letters describing Mr. Stewart  as a man of faith \nand hi s impact on those with whom he has served time.  Many of the letters reflect admiration and \ngratitude to Mr. Stewart for help during their time in prison that has endured through their post -\nprison lives.  That Mr. Stewart has made such strides is no small thing and certainly worthy of \nrespect.  \nRehabilitation, even extraordinary rehabilitation, however, bears an extremely high burden \nto merit release.  Indeed, according to Congress, rehabilitation by itself does not qualify as an \n\u201cextraordinary and compellin g\u201d reason.  28 U.S.C.  \u00a7 994(t) (\u201cRehabilitation of the defendant alone \nshall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.\u201d).  Even if that were not so, \nhowever, it seems that Mr. Stewart still has some work to do.  As the Government points out , \n \n1  The Challenge Program is a one - to three -year \u201ccognitive -behavioral, residential treatment \nprogram\u201d that \u201cfocuses on the reduction of antisocial peer associations; promotion of \npositive relationships; increased self -control and problem -solving skills; and development \nof pro -social behaviors.\u201d   \u201cThe program places a special emphasis on violence prevention.\u201d   \nSee Directory of National Programs, Federal Bureau of Prisons. \n \n2  In the Inmate Suicide Watch Program, the  Psychology Department trains approved and \nresponsible inmates on mental illness and suicide prevention to enable them to monitor at -\nrisk inmates.   (See D.I. 275, Ex . F, Inmate Suicide Watch Companion Program Certificate \nand Documentation).  5 Mr. Stewart has accumulated ten infractions while in BOP custody, including five relating to the \npossession of weapons.  ( See D.I. 278, Ex. A).  Although seven of those ten are old, two occurred \nin the last few years and involved fighting and possessing a  dangerous weapon.  (Id.).  The Court \ndoes not mean to detract from the accomplishments Mr. Stewart has achieved , but these incidents \ndo, however, suggest that his rehabilitation is ongoing and that it cannot yet be said to be \n\u201cexceptional to a marked extent,\u201d such that it is extraordinary, nor \u201ccompelling\u201d such that it \nconvinces the Court that his rehabilitation is sufficient to merit release from prison  at this time .   \nB. Attempted Prison Rape  \nMr. Stewart was the victim of an attempted prison rape .  Although this charge is serious  \nand concerning, the Court is not convinced that it falls within the ambit of \u201cextraordinary and \ncompelling\u201d circumstances that allow for release from an otherwise lawful incarceration.  \nSee United States v. Tate, 2022 WL 827256, at *2 (W.D.N.C. Mar. 18, 2022) (\u201cAn inmate\u2019s reasonable fear of assault by other inmates within the BOP is not an extraordinary or compelling reason for compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A).\u201d).  M oreover, it appears that \nMr. Stewart r aised this charge in connection with the instant motio n.  As the government points \nout, \u201c there is a large and sophisticated regulatory regime already in place to handle allegations of \nprisoner rape, none of which has occurred in this case.\u201d  (D.I. 278 at 6- 7).  No investigation has \nbeen done, no remedies have been sought under the applicable policies , and no litigation has been \nfiled to substantiate the claims.  Thus, at this point, the Court cannot base a finding of extraordinary \nand compelling reasons on t he rape allegations.  \nC. COVID-19 \nMr. Stewart\u2019s concerns regarding future susceptibility to COVID -19 variants are not \n\u201cextraordinary and compelling reasons\u201d meriting release.  Mr. Stewart has recovered from COVID- 19 and has been fully vaccinated.  As the Third  Circuit has held: \u201cthe mere existence of 6 \nCOVID- 19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot \nindependently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP\u2019s statutory role, and its \nextensive and professional efforts to curtail the virus\u2019s spread.\u201d  United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d \n594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020).  Instead, an inmate \u201cmust at least show: (1) a sufficiently serious medical \ncondition, or advanced age, placing the prisoner at a uniquely high risk of grave illness or death if infected by COVID -19; and (2) an actual, non- speculative risk of exposure to CO VID-19 in the \nfacility where the prisoner is held.\u201d  See United States v. Tartaglione , 2020 WL 3969778, at *5-6 \n(E.D. Pa. July 14, 2020) (quotation omitted).   \nHere, the record shows that Mr. Stewar t receives regular medical care and his increased \nrisk of g etting very sick from COVID -19 appears at most to be minimally increased over that of \nothers.  Thus, he does not have such health issues as to demonstrate \u201cextraordinary and compelling circumstances,\u201d even when combined with the on- going COVID -19 pandemic .  Thus, he does not \nqualify for compassionate release on this ground. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nTHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Mr. Stewart\u2019s \nmotion for compassionate release (D.I. 261) is DENIED.  \n \n              \n       The Honorable M aryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge "}
