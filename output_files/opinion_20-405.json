On October 13, 2021, Plaintiff Osteoplastics, LLC \n(\u201cPlaintiff \u201d or \u201cOsteoplastics\u201d) objected to the Report .  (D.I. 92 ).  On October 27, 2021, \nConfor MIS, Inc. (\u201cCo nforMIS \u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d) responded to Plaintiff \u2019s objections.  (D.I. 95).  \nThe Court has reviewed the Report, the objections and the response s thereto, and has \nconsidered de nov o the original claim construction briefing and supporting documents, as well as \nthe transcript of the claim construction hearing regarding the objected to terms.  See, e.g., St. Clair \nIntellectual Prop. Consultants, Inc. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 691 F. Supp. 2d 538, 541- 42 \n(D. Del. 2010); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(l) ; FED. R. CIV. P. 72(b)(3 ).  For the reasons set forth below, \nthe objections to the Report are OVERRULED  and t he recommended constructions are \nADOPTED.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.   Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n \n1  The Report was issued in this matter as well as in related matter, C.A. No. 20- 406 between \nPlaintiff and DePuy Synthes, Inc., DePuy  Synthes Products, Inc., and Synthes, Inc. \n(collectively, \u201cDePuy\u201d) .  DePuy filed objections to the Report on October 13, 2021 \n(D.I.  104 in C.A. No. 20 -406) and on January 21, 2022, the parties filed, and the Court \ngranted, a Stipulation and Order for Dismissal with Prejudice (D.I. 122, 123 in \nC.A.  No. 20-406).  In light of the settlement, the Court does not address DePuy\u2019s \nobjections. 2 135 S. Ct. 831, 837- 38 (2015).  \u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and  \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill \nin the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent \napplication.\u201d   Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  Although \u201cthe claims themselves provide substantial \nguidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms,\u201d the context of the surrounding words of the \nclaim also must be considered.   Id. at 1314.  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id. at 13 21 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201cis always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, \nInc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201cthe specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meani ng it would \notherwise possess.  In such cases, the inventor \u2019s lexicography governs.\u201d  Phillips, 415 F.3d at  \n1316.  \u201cEven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of \nthe patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to \nlimit the claim scope  using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d  Hill- Rom \nServs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quota tion marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201cshould also consi der the patent \u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d   Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967,980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en bane), aff \u2019d, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201cintrinsic evidence,  \n. . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and Trade mark 3 Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\u201d  Phillips, 415  F.3d \nat 1317.  \u201c[T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by \ndemonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the \ninvention in the course of prosecuti on, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise \nbe.\u201d  Id . \nIn some cases, courts \u201cwill need to look beyond the patent \u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the meani ng of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\u201d  Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841.  \nExtrinsic evidence \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent  and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d  Markman, 52 F.3d  \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201cto ensure that the court \u2019s understanding of the technical \naspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a \npartic ular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.\u201d   \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of  the fact that \u201cexpert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer from bias that is not present in intrinsic evidence.\u201d   Id.  Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201cmay \nbe useful to the court,\u201d it is \u201cless reliable\u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201cis unlikely to result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof the patented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. \nv. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1583).  \n  4 II. DISCUSSION  \nPlaintiff objects to five of the  ten2 constructions adopted in the Report: \u201canatomical \nlandmarks,\u201d the \u201csuperimposing\u201d and \u201cmatching\u201d terms, \u201cdetermining\u201d and \u201ctemplate.\u201d  The \nCourt addresses each in turn.   \nA. \u201cAnatomical Landmarks \u201d \nThe Report  recommended construing \u201canatomical landmarks\u201d to mean \u201cspecific points of \nreference on the anatomy or images of anatomy.\u201d  (D.I. 89 at 4).  Plaintiff objects that a natomical \nlandmarks need not be pre -defined points.  The Court has carefully reviewed the record regarding \nthe cons truction of \u201canatomical landmarks\u201d de novo  as well as the Report, which states:  \nThe parties dispute the construction of \u201canatomical landmarks.\u201d The \nparties appear to agree that the construction should make clear that \u201canatomical landmarks\u201d are \u201clocations\u201d or \u201cpoints,\u201d that they must \nbe locations or points \u201cof reference,\u201d and that they exist on images of anatomy.  \nAs I understand the dispute, it is essentially this: Plaintiff argues that \u201canatomical landmarks\u201d is broad enough to include landmarks that \nare def ined by the user during performance of the claimed methods. \nDefendants disagree and argue that \u201canatomical landmarks\u201d must be landmarks \u2014specific points, such as the tip of the nose, the molar, \netc.\u2014a subset of which can be identified by the user during \nperformance of the claimed method, but are pre- defined. To that \nend, Defendants\u2019 proposed construction requires that the \u201canatomical landmarks\u201d be \u201cspecific points of reference\u201d and that those points be \u201cconsistent across the same species.\u201d  \nI agree with Defen dants that \u201canatomical landmarks\u201d must be \n\u201cspecific points of reference,\u201d although I disagree with Defendants that adding the language \u201cconsistent across the same species\u201d will resolve any dispute between the parties or clarify anything for the jury. \n \n2  The parties presented thirteen disputes but agreed  on the meaning of one term (\u201cnormative \nshape\u201d) (D.I. 89 at 2) and agre ed to postpone the issue of definiteness of two others \n(\u201crendering a volumetric image at least a portion of a patient from image data of the patient\u201d and \u201cextracting a region of interest from the volumetric image of the patient, wherein the volumetric imag e comprises target tissue of interest of a patient\u201d) ( id. at 5).  5 The claim language does not aid in resolving this dispute. Turning \nto the specification, it supports Defendants\u2019 construction. The specification refers to \u201cType II landmarks,\u201d9 which are \u201cdisplay[ed]\u201d in Figures 19A and 19B. ( See, e.g., \u2019557 Patent, 21:59-\n67.) Figures 19A and 19B show specific points of reference on the \nsoft tissue of a face and the bony surface of a skull, respectively. \nThose visual depictions are consistent with the specification\u2019s \nconsistent description of anatomical landmarks as specific, predefined points of reference. ( See, e.g., id. at 19:26- 27 (referring \nto \u201cmanually located, highly reliable, single point anatomical landmarks\u201d).)  \nPlaintiff suggests that the specification contemplates manual definition of landmarks by the user. But the specification appears to contemplate the manual location or identification of landmarks, rather than the manual definition of landmarks themselves. ( See, \ne.g., id. at 22:28- 32 (\u201cThe first step in the Simulated Annealing -\nbased Surface Extraction (SASE) proc ess is the operator\u2019s manual \nlocation of the Type II landmarks on the graphical manifold surface. These landmarks attach the ridge curve- based deformable template \nto the graphical manifold surface via a thin plate spline warp.\u201d), 41:55- 57 (\u201cThe anaplast manually identifies and labels anatomical \nlandmarks. It is expected that later techniques will use computer -\nassisted landmark labeling.\u201d).)  \nPlaintiff also contends that \u201cpreferred embodiments\u201d disclosed by \nthe specification show that \u201cthe relevant landmarks for the claimed methods may change based on the location of the defective anatomy (e.g., the specific \u2018defect margin\u2019).\u201d (D.I. 79 at 95.) But the cited \nportion of the specification doesn\u2019t say that. ( See \u2019557 Patent, 41:60-\n42:24 (\u201cAn implant shape is defined by finding a defect margin in a skull surface and transferring the defect margin to the warped skull surface. The warped skull surface is pinned down at the defect margin and all points exterior to the defect region. The warped skull surface tangents ar e also pinned down at the defect margin.\u201d).) \nMoreover, while the specification contemplates that a user performing the claimed method might identify different landmarks depending on the nature and location of the defect, it does not contemplate that a user  would employ anything other than specific, \npre-defined landmarks. \nPlaintiff further contends that the specification \u201cstates that some features of the anatomy will result in \u2018more easily, and more repeatedly, detected anatomical landmark coordinates,\u2019 which means that some anatomical landmarks may be characterized [as specific points of reference], but others may not.\u201d (D.I. 79 at 91 6 (quoting \u2019557 Patent, 19:30- 32).) I disagree. The passage Plaintiff \nquotes from reads in full:  \nThe last measure [(superimposi tion of manually \nlocated, highly reliable, single point anatomical \nlandmarks)] is similar to a qualitative visual determination of the completeness of anatomical features seen on the segmented surface. Clearer features will result in more easily, and more repeatably, detected anatomical landmark coordinates by trained workers.  \n(\u2019557 Patent, 19:26- 32.) That passage does not imply that only some \nanatomical landmarks should be easily and repeatably detected. It says that some conditions ( e.g., clearer features) will lead to better \nmanual detection of anatomical landmarks.  \nThe prosecution history also supports Defendants\u2019 construction. As discussed at the hearing, the \u2019277 Provisional Application was incorporated by reference in several of the patents and provides relevant evidence as to how the inventors understood the term \u201canatomical landmark.\u201d That application contains a glossary, which defines \u201clandmark\u201d as: \u201c[a] specific point on a biological form, or image of a form, located according to a geometri c or textural rule \nand underlying developmental constraints.\u201d (D.I. 81, Ex. 19 at 40.)  \nI don\u2019t think that Defendants\u2019 inclusion of the phrase \u201cconsistent across the same species\u201d will resolve any dispute between the parties or clarify anything for the jury. Accordingly, I recommend that the Court adopt the construction: \u201cspecific points of reference on the anatomy or images of anatomy.\u201d  \nThe Report carefully analyzed the intrinsic evidence and the arguments put forth by the \nparties.  The Court agrees with the Report \u2019s reasoning and the analysis of the intrinsic evidence , \nas well as the ultimate recommended construction.  Plaintiff\u2019s objection to the construction of \n\u201canatomical landmarks \u201d is overruled . \n  7 B. \u201cSuperimposing\u201d and \u201cMatching\u201d  \nThe Report recommende d construing the \u201csuperimposing\u201d terms3 to mean:  \u201cautomatically \nmatching the anatomical landmarks of the template with the same anatomical landmarks on the \nrepresentation of the target tissue using only a computer algorithm\u201d with the added clarification that \u201cthis construction does not preclude the manual identification of anatomical landmarks on the \nrepresentation of target tissue before the superimposing step or manual correction after the \nsuperimposing step.\u201d  (D.I. 89 at 3).  As for the \u201cmatching term ,\u201d\n4 as noted above, the Report \nrecognized that Defendant may reraise their definiteness arguments, but recommended that \u201c[i] f \nthe claim is not found to be indefinite, the Court should construe the claim to require that the \nmatching occur wit h respect to \u2018 landmarks \u2019 and occur \u2018automatically . . . using only a computer \nalgorithm. \u2019  The Court should also clarify that its construction does not preclude the manual \nidentification of anatomical landmarks on the representation of tissue before the ma tching step or \nmanual correction after the matching step. \u201d  (D.I. 89 at 4 ).  Plaintiff objects that the \n\u201csuperimposing\u201d and \u201cmatching\u201d terms are not limited to automatically matching anatomical \nlandmarks.  With respect to that issue, the Court has carefull y reviewed the record de novo  as well \nas the Report, which states:  \n \n3  The \u201csuperimposing terms\u201d are \u201csuperimposing on the computer generated 3- dimensional \nrepresentation [of the defective portion and the non- defective portion of the tissue] a \ntemplate\u201d / \u201csuperimposing on the image a 3\u2010dimensional template\u201d / \u201csuperimposing a \nthree- dimensional template onto the 3\u2010dimensional representation\u201d / \u201csuperimposing a \ntemplate onto the 3 -dimensional representation\u201d / \u201csuperimposing onto the rendered \ncomputer\u2010generated three- dimensional representation of the target tissue a three\u2010\ndimen sional template\u201d / \u201csuperimposing onto the mapped external surface a three -\ndimensional template.\u201d  (D.I. 89 at 3).  \n \n4  The complete term is \u201cmatching a computer -rendered three- dimensional template onto a \ncomputer -rendered three dimensional surface of tissue surrounding the patient\u2019s target \ntissue of interest.\u201d  (D.I. 89 at 4).  8 Moving on to the superimposing term. The parties are at least in \ngeneral agreement that the general definition of superimposing does not properly reflect the term\u2019s meaning in the context of the claim language. There is no express definition of superimposing in the specification. Both sides point to the intrinsic evidence to support \ntheir construction of superimposing. Accordingly, I will look at the \nintrinsic evidence as informing the meani ng of superimposing. \nThe parties\u2019 competing constructions suggest three sub- disputes. \u2026 \nThe third sub- dispute has to do with whether correlating or matching \nof the landmarks proceeds automatically using only a [computer] \nalgorithm. There was a lot of discussion today during the argument about this sub- dispute. I agree with Defendants\u2019 counsel that the real \ndispute here seems to be this: When the matching of landmarks is going on, what is doing it? Is there an algorithm that is matching landmarks in the  templates to the landmarks in the patient\u2019s image?  \nTo resolve that dispute, let me make clear what I think is not in dispute. There\u2019s no dispute that the identification of a landmark on the patient image can be done manually and should not be excluded by the construction; there\u2019s no dispute that there can be a manual \ncorrection after the superimposing step and that that manual correction should not be excluded by the construction; there\u2019s no dispute that when identification of landmarks is done manually or  \nwhen corrections are done manually, both of those things are on the computer and that computer algorithms are involved. \nBut that doesn\u2019t really answer the question of whether there must be an algorithm to match the landmarks on the image to the landmarks on the template. And on that dispute, I agree with Defendants that there has to be some sort of automatic matching that occurs. Again, the parties are in agreement that the superimposing term means the same thing in the patents in which it is used. And in the prosecution history, in particular the portion located at D.I. 81, Exhibit 23 [at pp. 11], the patentee distinguished a prior art reference on the basis that the superimposing step could not be performed manually in the claimed invention, notwithstandi ng the prior art\u2019s ability to \nmanipulate an image on a computer. And I\u2019ll point the parties to the discussion we had during the oral argument today.  \nAs for the specification, it is consistent with the understanding that the [matching] of the landmarks proc eeds with a computer \nalgorithm. There are no embodiments proposed in the specification that are being read out by requiring that the [matching] of the landmarks proceeds using a computer algorithm. And while I don\u2019t base any of this decision on Plaintiff\u2019s  prior representations to the 9 Court in the \u00a7 101 briefing, I do not think that my ruling is \ninconsistent with those representations.  \nAll of that said, I would be amenable to adding some language to the construction of this term to clarify that it doesn\u2019t e xclude manual \nidentification of landmarks and/or manual correction, in addition to \ncomputer matching. So, the parties should meet and confer within \n14 days and submit a proposal as to the additional language that the \nCourt could consider on this term. \n \n*  *  * \nTurning to matching, Defendants say that the matching term in the \u2019756 Patent fails to inform with reasonable certainty those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention because the intrinsic record contains no guidance about what constitutes tissue surrounding the \ntarget tissue of interest or how it could be matched. Here again, the record is not sufficient for me to conclude that [the] \u201ctissue surrounding the patient\u2019s target tissue of interest\u201d [phrase] makes the term indefinite. Defendants can raise the indefiniteness \nargument at the summary judgment stage. To the extent that the term is not indefinite, my rulings as to the sub- disputes on the \nsuperimposing step also apply to the matching step. \nAs with \u201canatomical landmarks,\u201d the Court agree s with the Report\u2019s reasoning and the \nanalysis of the specification , as well as the ultimate recommended construction s.  Plaintiff\u2019s \nobjection to the construction of the \u201c superimposing\u201d and \u201cmatching\u201d  terms  is overruled.  \n 3. \u201cDetermining\u201d Terms  \nThe Report recommended construing the \u201cdetermining\u201d  terms\n5 to mean \u201c[to \ndetermine]/[determining] the three -dimensional shape of [a medical device]/[an implant] as a \nfunction of the respective shapes of the defective portion of the patient image and the template.\u201d  \n(D.I. 89 at 4).  Plaintiff objects to that last part of the construction, i.e. , that determining should not \nbe limited to using a function of the shape of the defective portion of the patient image  and \n \n5  The terms are \u201cto determine the [three]/[3] -dimensional shape of the medical device\u201d / \u201cto \ndetermine the 3 -dimensional implant shape\u201d / \u201cdetermining the [three]/[3] -dimensional \nshape of the medical device\u201d / \u201cdetermining a 3 -dimensional shape of the implant .\u201d  \n(D.I.  89 at 4).  10 template.   Once again, the Court has carefully reviewed the record de novo as well as the Report, \nwhich states:  \nThe claims of six of the patents -in-suit require a step \u201cto determine\u201d \nor of \u201cdetermining\u201d the three -dimensional shape of the medical \ndevice/implant. At the hearing, it appeared that the parties might be \nable to make progress toward an agreed -upon construction, so I \nordered them to meet and confer on this term. The parties\u2019 recent submission indicates that Defendants would drop the phrase \u201cexternal shape\u201d from their proposed construction. (D.I. 85 at 2.) But the parties were unable to fully resolve their dispute. ( Id.) \nThe remaining difference between their constructions appears to be this: Plaintiff says that the disputed phrase encompasses any use of the template to determine the shape of the medical device, without \nany restriction on method or function. Defendants say that the disputed phrase should be construed to make clear that the shape of the medical device is determined \u201cas a function of the difference between the respective shapes of the defective portion of the patient image and the template.\u201d There is no dispute that the shape of the device must be determined based on the template.  \nBeginning with the claim language, Plaintiff points out that some of the dependent claims specify that the determining function is accomplished \u201cas a function of respective shapes of the defective \nportion and the template.\u201d ( See, e.g., \u2019191 Patent, claims 11, 13; see \nalso \u2019920 Patent, claims 4, 6.) Plaintiff argues that, because the \ndependent claims set forth additional restrictions about how the determining is performed, it would be improper to include those additional restrictions into the construction of determining. The doctrine of claim differentiation can, as Plaintiff argues, assist in claim interpretation. But the doctrine of claim differentiation does not require claims to be construed broader than would otherwise be appropriate in light of the specification. Here, the specification suggests a narrower construction than the one Plaintiff proposes.  \nThe specification consistently provides that the shape of the medical device is determined \u201cas a function of respective shapes\u201d of the template and the defective portion. ( See, e.g. , \u2019557 Patent, Abstract, \n4:66- 5:2 (\u201cSumm ary of the Invention\u201d), 5:35- 37.) Some of those \nportions of the specification are statements of general applicability and, contrary to Plaintiff\u2019s suggestion, no other way of determining the three- dimensional shape of the medical device is even hinted at \nin the specification. Moreover, contrary to Plaintiff\u2019s argument, \nconstruing the determining phrase as Defendants propose would not exclude embodiments that include warping, as the specification 11 describes performing the determining step after warping. ( See, e.g., \n\u2019557 Patent, 10:58- 11:4, 41:60- 42:24.)  \nTurning to the prosecution history, Defendants point out that the \ninventors discussed the process for determining the shape of the medical device during prosecution of the \u2019557 Patent. The inventors \nexplained that \u201c[w]ithout comparison to the patient\u2019s missing or \ndefective portions of tissue the natural asymmetry as well as the \nactual dimensions of the region to receive an implant must be accounted for, there is a high degree of likelihood that the im plant \nwill not fit well.\u201d (D.I. 81, Ex. 30 at 8- 9.) While that passage might \nnot satisfy the high standard required for a disavowal of claim scope, it does shed light on how the inventors understood the process of determining the shape of the medical devic e. My recommendation \nis consistent with that understanding.  \nAccordingly, I agree with Defendants that the construction of the determining phrase should specify that the shape of the medical device/implant is determined as a function of the respective shapes of the defective portion and the template. Defendants also seek to add the additional language that the shape be determined \u201cas a function of the difference between the respective shapes of the defective portion of the patient image and the template.\u201d I\u2019 m not \npersuaded that including that language is appropriate. The specification describes determining the shape of an implant \u201cas a function of a difference between the mapped points on the external \nsurface of the target tissue and the external surface of t he template\u201d \n(e.g., \u02bc557 Patent, 11:1- 14), but it\u2019s not clear to me that that\u2019s \nnecessarily the same thing as determining the shape as a function of the difference between the \u201cdefective portions\u201d and the template (as Defendants propose), or even if the la tter makes sense.  \nAccordingly, I recommend that the Court adopt the construction: \u201c[to determine]/[determining] the three -dimensional shape of [a \nmedical device]/[an implant] as a function of the respective shapes of the defective portion of the patient im age and the template.\u201d  \nThe Report carefully analyzed the claim language, the specification and the prosecution \nhistory in making the recommended construction.  The Court agrees with the Report\u2019s reasoning \nand the analysis of the intrinsic evidence , as well  as the ultimate recommended construction.  \nPlaintiff\u2019s objection to the construction of the \u201cdetermining\u201d  terms  is overruled. 12  4. \u201cTemplate\u201d  \nThe Report recommended construing \u201ctemplate\u201d to mean \u201cwire frame pattern representing \na shape of patient tissue .\u201d  (D.I. 89 at 2).  During claim construction before Judge Hall, there were \nmultiple disputes  relating to this term.  Here, Plaintiff objects to the resolution of one of those \ndisputes, arguing that \u201ctemplate\u201d should not be limited to wire frame patterns  and the Report \nimproperly relied on lexicography.   With respect to that issue, the Court has carefully reviewed \nthe record de novo as well as the Report , which states:  \n. . . [T]he parties [agree] that template does not have an ordinary and \ncustomary  meaning in the field of the invention, and this isn\u2019t a \nsituation where there is an express definition of template in the specification. The parties are also in agreement that the Court should look to the intrinsic evidence to determine how the inventor understood the term template. \nThe first sub -dispute is whether template must have a wire frame \npattern. On this sub- dispute, I side with Defendants. The provisional \napplication to which the patents claim priority contained a glossary, \nand that glossary cont ained a definition of a \u201cdeformable template.\u201d \nIt expressly defined \u201cdeformable template\u201d as a \u201cwire frame pattern \nassigned to a shape\u201d that approximates its topology. (D.I. 81, Ex. 17 at 30, Ex. 19 at 39.) Some, but not all, of the patents -in-suit express ly \nincorporate the provisional application by reference. And no party has argued that template should have a different meaning in the patents that do not incorporate the provisional application by reference. Rather, everyone agrees that template should be given the same meaning across all the patents.  \nEven if the patents did not incorporate the provisional by reference, under the circumstances here, where the parties agree that there is no ordinary and customary meaning in the field of the invention, I woul d consider the provisional application\u2019s definition highly \nrelevant to the question of what the inventor understood the term to mean.  \nPlaintiff cites the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in MPHJ , but that \ndecision is distinguishable for multiple reasons, not the  least of \nwhich is it didn\u2019t involve a provisional application\u2019s express definition of a term that was later used in the patent. Moreover, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed in that case that a provisional \u201ccan contribute to understanding the claims.\u201d  13 Plaintif f also points out that the provisional definition actually refers \nto a deformable template, but the claims require only a template. I \ndon\u2019t think that matters for at least these reasons. One,  whether the template is deformable has nothing to do with wheth er it has a wire \nframe structure, which is the dispute that I\u2019m resolving. Two, the \nclaims of all the patents except for the \u2019756 patent separately recite \nthat the template is deformed, confirming that in those claims, the \ntemplate must be deformable. And three, no one is suggesting that the claimed template doesn\u2019t have to be deformable. \nThe understanding of template to refer to a wire frame pattern is \nconsistent with all references to template in the specification and in the prosecution history, including, for example, the inventor declarations at Exhibits 21 and 22 (D.I. 81, Ex. 21 at 7, Ex. 22 at 7) and Figure 21- A of the patents.  \nPlaintiff argues that a wire frame construction would exclude other embodiments in the specification, but I agree with Defendants that there are no embodiments described in the specification where the template has anything other than a wire frame structure. The portions of the specification cited by Plaintiff at [\u02bc557 Patent] 41:60-67 and 21:61- 63 do not, as Plaintiff suggests, indicate that a wire \nframe structure is optional. Rather, as Defendants point out, the optional aspect is which parts of the wire frame can be used in another step.  \nPlaintiff also points out that the specification describes that a template can be derived f rom various sources of data and have \nvarious shapes, but I agree with Defendants that Plaintiff\u2019s argument conflates two issues: the structure of the template, which I agree has to be a wire frame, with the shape that the template represents, which can include various shapes and be derived from various sources.  \nTo be clear, I understand that it\u2019s improper to import limitations into claims from examples or embodiments in the specification. But that is not what I\u2019m doing. Again, the circumstances here are tha t the \nparties agree that the word template does not have a customary meaning in the art and can only be understood with reference to intrinsic evidence. The provisional application sets forth the definition of template, and that definition is consistent with every embodiment described in the specification. Under those circumstances, I am not importing a limitation into the term, I\u2019m construing the term in accordance with the intrinsic evidence.  14 The Court finds that the Report\u2019s reasoning is sound and supported by the intrinsic \nevidence.  The Court agrees with the Report , and Plaintiff\u2019s objection to the construction of \n\u201ctemplate\u201d is overruled.  \nIII. CONCLUSION \n For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff\u2019s objections are OVER RULED  and the Report is \nADOPTED.  An appropriate order will follow .
