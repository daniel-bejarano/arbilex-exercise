Counsel for Defendants Warden Kolawole Akinbayo and Jennifer Barnes.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 28, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nST. U.S. Circuit Judge:\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff John E. Trotter (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), an inmate at Howard R. Young Correctional\nInstitution in Wilmington, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 4) He\nappears pro se and proceeds in forma pauperis. (D.I. 6) Before the Court is State Defendants\u2019 motion\nto dismiss and Plaintiffs combined response and motion to amend. (D.I. 14, 16)\n\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe Complaint alleges violations of the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution. (D.I. 4 at 5) The claims revolve around Plaintiffs classification and\nplacement in a sex offender transitional program. (Jd.) Plaintiff alleges he is not a sex offender, is\nnot currently incarcerated for a sex offense, and provided documentation to the warden that he is\nexempt from the requirements of 11 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 4120 and 4336. (Id. at 5-6) The Court screened this\nmatter on March 1, 2021, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), and determined that Plaintiff had raised\nwhat appeared to be cognizable and non-frivolous 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims. (D.I. 11)\n\nState Defendants Warden Kolawole Akinbayo (\u201cAkinbayo\u201d) and Jennifer Barnes (\u201cBarnes\u201d)\n(together \u201cState Defendants\u201d)' move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (D.I. 14)\nPlaintiff opposes and seeks leave to amend. (D.I. 16)\n\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires the\nCourt to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 223\n(3d Cir. 2004). \u201cThe issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant\n\nis entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d\n\n' The Complaint also names Heidi Holloway (\u201cHolloway\u201d) as a defendant. She has been served, but\nhas not answered or otherwise appeared. (See DI. 13)\n\n1\n1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court may grant such a\nmotion to dismiss only if, after \u201caccepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and\nviewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d Maio \u00bb. Aetna,\nInc, 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions. See Ashcroft\n\u00bb. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Ath Corp. \u00bb. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A plaintiff\nmust plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v, City of\nShelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not dismissed, however, for imperfect statements of\nthe legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\n\u201cTo sutvive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018raise a right to relief\nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true (even if\n\n- doubtful in fact).\u201d\u201d Victaulie Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 555). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d\nIqbal, 556 US. at 678. At bottom, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff's claim.\nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald assertions,\u201d Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist.,\n132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \u201cunsupported conclusions and\nunwarranted inferences,\u201d Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power \u00a2\u00bb Light Co., 113 F.3d 405,\n417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \u201cself-evidently false,\u201d Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d\n\nCir. 1996). Because Plaintiff proceeds prv se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint,\n\u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted\nby lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule 12(6)(6) motions. See\ne.g. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\nstandard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). The Court screened this\ncase, liberally construed it, and determined that Plaintiff has raised cognizable and non-frivolous\nclaims. (See D.I. 11)\n\nState Defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiff was not denied due process\nand they are entitled to qualified and sovereign immunity. (D.I. 14) State Defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss Plaintiffs due process claim rests upon his alleged conviction. They refer to Exhibit A and\nassert that Plaintiff was convicted of unlawful sexual contact in the third degree on April 24, 1977.\n(DI. 14 at 1) State Defendants did not provide Exhibit A to the Court. Under the circumstances,\nthen, the Court must credit Plaintiffs allegations, for purposes of the pending motions. Therefore,\nthe motion to dismiss the due process claim and on the grounds of qualified immunity will be\ndenied without prejudice to renew.\n\nState Defendants also move to dismiss those claims raised against them in their official\ncapacities based under immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh\nAmendment of the United States Constitution protects an unconsenting state or state agency from a\nsuit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens, regardless of the relief sought. See Seminole\nTribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Pennhurst State Sch. Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89\n\n(1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). \u201c[A] suit against a state official in his or her official\ncapacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official\u2019s office. As such, it is\nno different from a suit against the State itself.\u201d W2l/ v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71\n(1989) (internal citations omitted); A4 \u00bb Howard, 353 F. App\u2019x 667, 672 (3d Cir. 2009). The claims\nraised against State Defendants in their official capacities are barred by the Eleventh Amendment\nand, therefore, State Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on this ground will be granted.\nVv. MOTION TO AMEND\n\nPlaintiff moves for leave to file an amended complaint. (D.I. 16) Local Rule 15.1 provides\nthat a party who moves to amend a pleading shall attach to the motion: (1) the proposed pleading as\namended, complete with a handwritten or electronic signature; and (2) a form of the amended\npleading, which indicates in what respect it differs from the pleading which it amends, by bracketing\nor striking through materials to be deleted and underlining materials to be added. Plaintiff did not\ncomply with this rule.\n\nTherefore, Plaintiffs motion will be denied without prejudice to renew upon compliance\nwith the Local Rules of this Court. (D.I. 16)\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant in part and deny without prejudice to renew\nin part State Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 14); and (2) deny without prejudice to renew\nPlaintiff's motion for leave to amend. (D.I. 16)\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nJOHN E. TROTTER,\n\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ. No. 20-336-LPS\n\nWARDEN KOLAWOLE AKINBAYO\netal,\n\nDefendants.\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 28\" day of March, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1s State Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED without\nprejudice to renew in part. (D.I. 14) The claims raised against State Defendants in their official\ncapacities are DISMISSED.\n\n2. Plaintiff's motion or leave to amend DENIED without prejudice to renew.
