BACKGROUND\n\na. Procedural History\n\nOn January 30, 2020, Plaintiffs filed this personal injury action against multiple\nDefendants, asserting claims arising from Mr. Glaze\u2019s alleged harmful exposure to asbestos.\n(D.L. 1, Ex. 1) On March 17, 2020, Defendant CBS Corporation removed the case to this court\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1442(a)(1), the federal officer removal statute,\u201d and 1446. (D.I. 1) In\nSeptember and October of 2021, the six moving Defendants filed motions for summary judgment\nand opening briefs. (D.I. 105; D.I. 110; D.I. 112; D.I. 114; D.I. 116) Plaintiffs did not file\nanswering briefs to any of the motions, so they are deemed unopposed.\n\nb. Facts\n\nMr. Glaze served in the Navy for approximately 20 years, from November of 1966 to\nMarch or April of 1986. (D.I. 115, Ex. B at 15:6-15) After enlisting, Mr. Glaze attended three\nmonths of basic training in San Diego, California. (/d. at 15:22-16:6) Following basic training,\n\nMr. Glaze was stationed on the USS Ranger in Bremerton, Washington, where he worked as a\n\n2 The federal officer removal statute permits removal of a state court action to federal court\nwhen, inter alia, such action is brought against \u201c[t]he United States or an agency thereof or any\nofficer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or of any agency thereof,\nsued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1442(a)(1).\nfireman apprentice and third-class machinist\u2019s mate in the engine room. (/d. at 16:7-19; D.I.\n111, Ex. A at 92:2-8) Throughout Mr. Glaze\u2019s testimony, he indicated that his work in engine\nand evaporator rooms on the various vessels involved maintaining and operating turbines,\ngenerators, valves, pumps, and other equipment, including removing and replacing packing and\ngaskets during maintenance or overhaul. (D.I. 111, Ex. A at 115:3-7, 116:16-117:18, 122:12-15;\nD.I. 115, Ex. B at 16:10-18:18, 21:25-22:14) From 1970 to 1973, Mr. Glaze was stationed on\nthe USS Beatty in Tampa, Florida, where he worked as a third-class and second-class machinist\u2019s\nmate in the engine room performing the same work as he did on the USS Ranger. (DI. 115, Ex.\nB at 34:3-20; D.I. 111, Ex. A at 92:12-23) Mr. Glaze then worked for three months in the engine\nroom onboard the USS Saratoga. (D.I. 115, Ex. B at 47:11-49:1) In 1973, he was stationed at\nCorry Field in Pensacola, Florida, a Naval shore training facility, and worked as an auto service\nmanager for approximately two years. (Jd. at 53:7-25)\n\nFrom 1975 to 1976, Mr. Glaze worked as a second-class machinist\u2019s mate in the engine\nroom onboard the USS Lexington. (Id. at 59:14-60:6; D.I. 111, Ex. A at 109:13-20) From 1976\nto 1978, he worked in the evaporator room of the USS Sierra, in which he maintained and\noperated evaporators and pumps and changed oil, packing, and gaskets. (D.I. 115, Ex. B at 66:9-\n67:24) Mr. Glaze was then stationed in main control and the engine room onboard the USS\nDavis from 1978 to 1981 and engaged in a more supervisory role as an E-6 first-class. (Jd. at\n69:21-70:13; D.L. 111, Ex. A at 116:10-117:11) In 1981, he was stationed at Charleston, South\nCarolina Shore Intermediate Maintenance Activity for three years, where he overhauled pumps\nin the pump shop and became ship superintendent. (D.L. 115, Ex. B at 72:22-73:23; D.I. 111, Ex.\nA at 57:6-20) Afterwards, Mr. Glaze was again stationed on the USS Lexington in Pensacola,\n\nFlorida, where he worked in the supervisory position of chief machinist\u2019s mate in the engine\nroom. (D.I. 111, Ex. A at 57:25-58:10, 123:5-20) He remained there until he was honorably\ndischarged from the Navy in March or April of 1986. (D.I. 115, Ex. B at 15:9-18) Mr. Glaze\nthen worked as a ship superintendent at the Alabama Dry Dock from 1987 to 1989. (D.I. 1, Ex.\n1 at \u00a5 24)\n\nPlaintiffs allege in the complaint that Mr. Glaze developed lung cancer as a result of his\nexposure to asbestos-containing materials, including those provided by each of the moving\nDefendants, during his service in the United States Navy while working as a machinist mate\nonboard the USS Ranger, USS Beatty, USS Saratoga, USS Lexington, and the USS Sierra, as a\nmechanic at Corry Field Auto Repair, as well as during his occupation as a ship superintendent at\nthe Alabama Dry Dock. (D.I. 1, Ex. 1 at \u00a224) Plaintiffs assert claims for negligence, willful and\nwanton conduct, strict liability, concealment, misrepresentation, conspiracy, loss of consortium,\nmental anguish, and punitive damages. (D.I. 1, Ex. 1)\n\nMr. Glaze was deposed on January 12, 2021. (D.I. 111, Ex. A-B; D.I. 115, Ex. B-C)\nPlaintiffs did not produce any other product identification witnesses for deposition.\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\na. Summary Judgment\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those that could affect the outcome of the proceeding, and \u201ca\ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury\nto return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.\n2011) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely disputed\nmaterial fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to\ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial, and the court must view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458,\n460-61 (3d Cir. 1989); Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). A plaintiffs failure to respond\n\u201cis not alone a sufficient basis for the entry of a summary judgment.\u201d Anchorage Assocs. v.\nVirgin Islands Bd. of Tax Review, 922 F.2d 168, 175 (3d Cir. 1990). Even where a party does\nnot file a responsive submission to oppose the motion, the court must still find that the\nundisputed facts warrant judgment as a matter of law. See Miller v. Ashcroft, 76 F. App\u2019x 457,\n462 (3d Cir. 2003) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Lorenzo v. Griffith, 12 F.3d 23, 28 (3d Cir. 1993)).\nIn other words, the court must still determine whether the unopposed motion for summary\njudgment \u201chas been properly made and supported.\u201d Williams v. Murray, Inc., 2014 WL\n3783878, at *2 (D.N.J. July 31, 2014) (quoting Muskett v. Certegy Check Servs., Inc., 2010 WL\n2710555, at *3 (D.N.J. July 6, 2010)).\n\nb. Maritime Law: Substantial Factor Causation\n\nThe court granted the parties\u2019 stipulation for an order that maritime law shall apply to all\nissues regarding Naval and sea-based claims and either maritime or Florida law shall apply to\nfriction-based claims.? (D.I. 100) In order to establish causation in an asbestos claim under\n\nmaritime law, a plaintiff must show, for each defendant, \u201cthat (1) he was exposed to the\n\n3 Plaintiffs claims against the moving Defendants are Naval and sea-based, not friction-based.\n(D.I. 1, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 24; D.I. 106 at 3; DI. 111 at 7-13; D.I. 113 at 5-6; DL. 115 at 5; D.I. 117 at 4;\nD.I. 124 at 8-11) Therefore, maritime law applies to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the moving\nDefendants. (D.I. 100)\ndefendant\u2019s product, and (2) the product was a substantial factor\u2019 in causing the injury he\nsuffered.\u201d Lindstrom v. A-C Prod. Liab. Trust, 424 F.3d 488, 492 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Stark v.\nArmstrong World Indus., Inc., 21 F. App\u2019x 371, 375 (6th Cir. 2001)); Dumas v. ABB Grp., Inc.,\n2015 WL 5766460, at *8 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2015), report and recommendation adopted, 2016\nWL 310724 (D. Del. Jan. 26, 2016); Mitchell v. Atwood & Morrill Co., 2016 WL 4522172, at *3\n\u00a9. Del. Aug. 29, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 WL 5122668 (D. Del. Sept.\n19, 2016); Denbow v. Air & Liquid Sys. Corp., 2017 WL 1199732, at *4 (D. Del. Mar. 30, 2017),\nreport and recommendation adopted, 2017 WL 1427247 (D. Del. Apr. 19, 2017).\n\n\u201cTn establishing causation, a plaintiff may rely upon direct evidence (such as testimony of\nthe plaintiff or Decedent who experienced the exposure, co-worker testimony, or eye-witness\ntestimony) or circumstantial evidence that will support an inference that there was exposure to\nthe defendant\u2019s product for some length of time.\u201d> Abbay v. Armstrong Int'l, Inc., 2012 WL\n975837, at *1 n.1 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 29, 2012) (citing Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at 376). On the other hand,\n\u201c\u201cfmJinimal exposure\u2019 to a defendant\u2019s product is insufficient [to establish causation]. Likewise,\na mere showing that defendant\u2019s product was present somewhere at plaintiff's place of work is\ninsufficient.\u201d Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492 (quoting Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at 376) (internal citation\nomitted). \u201cRather, the plaintiff must show \u2018a high enough level of exposure that an inference\n\n4 \u201cMaritime law incorporates traditional \u2018substantial factor\u2019 causation principles, and courts often\n\nlook to the Restatement (2nd) of Torts for a more helpful definition.\u201d Delatte v. A.W. Chesterton\nCo., 2011 WL 11439126, at *1 n.1 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 28, 2011). \u201cThe comments to the Restatement\nindicate[] that the word \u2018substantial,\u2019 in this context, \u2018denote[s] the fact that the defendant\u2019s\nconduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a\ncause, using that word in the popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of\nresponsibility.\u2019\u201d Jd. (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 431 cmt. a (1965)).\n\n5 However, \u201csubstantial exposure is necessary to draw an inference from circumstantial evidence\nthat the exposure was a substantial factor in causing the injury.\u201d Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at 376\n(emphasis in original) (quoting Harbour v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 1991 WL 65201, at *4\n(6th Cir. Apr. 25, 1991)).\nthat the asbestos was a substantial factor in the injury is more than conjectural.\u2019\u201d Abbay, 2012\nWL 975837, at *1 n.1 (quoting Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492). \u201cTotal failure to show that the\ndefect caused or contributed to the accident will foreclose as a matter of law a finding of strict\nproduct{] liability.\u201d Stark, 21 F. App\u2019x at 376 (citations omitted).\nIV. DISCUSSION\na. Armstrong International, Inc.\n\nThe court recommends granting Armstrong\u2019s motion for summary judgment because\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether an Armstrong product was a\nsubstantial factor in causing Mr. Glaze\u2019s injuries. Plaintiffs did not identify any asbestos-\ncontaining Armstrong products or exposure to any Armstrong products. (See D.I. 111, Ex. A-B;\nsee also D.J. 115, Ex. B-C) The lack of evidence in the record on product identification and\ncausal nexus supports dismissal of the claims against Armstrong as a matter of law. See\nLindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492 (noting that a plaintiff must first show that \u201che was exposed to the\ndefendant\u2019s product\u201d to survive summary judgment under maritime law) (citing Stark, 21 F.\nApp\u2019x at 376).\n\nb. Air & Liquid Systems Corporation\n\nThe court recommends granting Air & Liquid\u2019s motion for summary judgment because\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether an Air & Liquid product was a\nsubstantial factor in causing Mr. Glaze\u2019s injuries. Air & Liquid is the successor by merger to\nBuffalo Pumps, Inc. (D.I. 1, Ex. 1 at 93; D.I. 111 at 1) Mr. Glaze testified generally about his\nwork in the engine rooms of several vessels without identifying any work in or around a Buffalo\n\nPump. (D.I. 115, Ex. B at 20:12-23, 36:3-7, 50:15-17, 68:4-14, 71:5-8) The lack of evidence in\nthe record on product identification and causal nexus supports dismissal of the claims against Air\n& Liquid as a matter of law. See Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492.\nce. Gardner Denver, Inc.\n\nThe court recommends granting Gardner\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there\nis no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether a Gardner product was a substantial\nfactor in causing Mr. Glaze\u2019s injuries. Plaintiffs did not identify any asbestos-containing\nGardner products or exposure to any Gardner products. (See D.I. 111, Ex. A-B; see also DI.\n115, Ex. B-C) The lack of evidence in the record on product identification and causal nexus\nsupports dismissal of the claims against Gardner as a matter of law. See Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at\n492.\n\nd. FMC Corporation\n\nThe court recommends granting FMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there is\nno genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether an FMC product was a substantial\nfactor in causing Mr. Glaze\u2019s injuries. FMC is the successor to Turbo Pump Operation, Chicago\nPump Company, and Northern Pump Company.\u00ae (D.I. 1, Ex. 1 at 99; D.I. 115 at 1-2) Mr.\nGlaze testified generally about his work in the engine rooms of several vessels without\nidentifying any work in or around a Turbo, Chicago, or Northern Pump. (D.I. 115, Ex. B at\n20:12-23, 36:3-7, 50:15-17, 68:4-14, 71:5-8) The lack of evidence in the record on product\nidentification and causal nexus supports dismissal of the claims against FMC as a matter of law.\n\nSee Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492.\n\n6 FMC states in its opening brief that it is improperly sued as \u201cFMC Corporation individually and\nas successor to Northern Pump Company, Coffin, Chicago Pump Company.\u201d (D.I. 115 at 1-2;\nsee D.I. 1, Ex. 1 at 49)\ne. Schneider Electric USA, Inc.\n\nThe court recommends granting Schneider\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there\nis no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether a Schneider product was a substantial\nfactor in causing Mr. Glaze\u2019s injuries. Schneider is formerly known as Square D Co. (\u201cSquare\nD\u201d). (DL 1, Ex. 1 at 920; D.I. 117 at 1) Plaintiffs did not identify any asbestos-containing\nSquare D products or exposure to any Square D products. (See D.I. 111, Ex. A-B; see also D.I.\n115, Ex. B-C) The lack of evidence in the record on product identification and causal nexus\nsupports dismissal of the claims against Schneider as a matter of law. See Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at\n492.\n\nf. Warren Pumps, LLC\n\nThe court recommends granting Warren Pumps\u2019 motion for summary judgment because\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether a Warren Pumps product was a\nsubstantial factor in causing Mr. Glaze\u2019s injuries. Mr. Glaze testified generally about his work in\nthe engine rooms of several vessels without identifying any work in or around a Warren Pump.\n(DI. 115, Ex. B at 20:12-23, 36:3-7, 50:15-17, 68:4-14, 71:5-8) The lack of evidence in the\nrecord on product identification and causal nexus supports dismissal of the claims against\nWarren Pumps as a matter of law. See Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court recommends GRANTING Armstrong, Air & Liquid,\nGardner, FMC, Schneider, and Warren Pumps\u2019 unopposed motions for summary judgment.\u2019\n(DI. 105; D.L. 110; D.L. 112; D.I. 114; D.L. 116; D.I. 123)\n\n7 The recommendation of the court that summary judgment should be granted due to lack of\nevidence pertaining to product identification and causation forecloses Plaintiffs\u2019 willful and\n\nwanton conduct, strict liability, concealment, conspiracy, misrepresentation, loss of consortium,\nmental anguish, and punitive damages claims.\nDefendant : Motion for Summary Judgment |\nstrong International, Inc.\n\nGardner Denver,\n\nIFMC Corporation\nSchneider Electric USA, Inc.\nWarren Pumps, LLC\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
