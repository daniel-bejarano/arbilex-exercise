Andrews  \nANDREWS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \n Petitioner Anthony Nastatos  is an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in \nSmyrna, Delaware.  P ending before the Court is  Petitioner\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Habeas \nCorpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.  (D.I  3)  The State file d an Answer in opposition.  (D.I. 15)  \nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will deny  the Petition .   \nI. BACKGROUND \n \n[Petitioner ] and [the victim]  met at work in August 2009 and \ndeveloped a friendly relationship.  Soon after they met, [ Petitioner ] \nanonymously covered [the victim\u2019s]  car with flower petals.  He later \nadmitted to the act and told her he had romantic feelings for her.  \n[The victim]  told [Petitioner ] she did not have romantic feelings for \nhim.  A few days later, they went shopping together, had dinner at a \nrestaurant, and met another co -worker for drinks.  [Petitioner\u2019s ] \nbehavior that night made [the victim]  uncomfortable.  [The victim\u2019s] \ndiscomfort forced her to cancel other plans they had made together.  After that, she avoided [ Petitioner ]. \n Over the following months, [Petitioner] repeatedly attempted \ncontact with [the victim]  by regularly sending lengthy love poetry \nvia text messages; w aiting for her after work; friending her on \nFacebook from accounts under his name and a pseudonym; and sending private messages over Facebook.  After [the victim]  shared \nwith her co -worker and manager a particular text from him, the \nmanager transferred [Petitioner] to another location.  Around this time, [the victim]  made her first report to the New \nCastle County Police Department. The NCCPD told [the victim]  to \nblock [Petitioner\u2019s] cell phone number, which she did. [Petitioner] continued to regularly conta ct her through Facebook.  [The victim]  \nagain contacted the NCCPD.  The police visited [Petitioner], who claimed he and [the victim] were dating. The police advised [Petitioner] to stay away from [the victim] . After [Petitioner] \npersisted in sending her mes sages, the NCCPD arrested [Petitioner].  \n \nNastatos v. State , 224 A.3d 201 (Table), 2019 WL 7041891, at  *1 (Del. Dec. 20, 2019).  Following \nhis arrest on October 12, 2010, as a condition of his bond, the Delaware Superior Court ordered \nPetitioner to have no contact with the victim.  (D.I. 16- 5 at 12; D.I. 16- 11 at 9 ; D.I. 16- 15 at  Entry 2 No. 1)   On October  29, 2010, the stalking charg e was reduced to two counts of harassment and \nprosecuted  in the Court of Common Pleas.  (D.I. 16- 15 at 6)  \n[Petitioner] continued to regularly send [the victim]  Facebook \nmessages and even messaged [the victim\u2019s]  father.  [Petitioner] \neventually arrived at the restaurant that was [the victim\u2019s]  primary \nplace of employment and attempted to speak with [the victim] .  [The \nvictim] ran to her car.  As she was fleeing, [Petitioner]  threw a ring \nbox at her.  [The victim]  contacted the NCCPD.  [Petitioner]  sent \n[the v ictim]  more Facebook messages.   After [the victim]  contacted \nthe NCCPD, they arrested [Petitioner] [on February 23, 2011] for \nadditional charges.   The Justice of the Peace issued a second no-\ncontact order.  \n Nastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, at *2.  After his arre st on February 23, 2011, Petitioner was \ncharged with one count of stalking and twenty counts of misdemeanor non- compliance with \nbond conditions (\u201cNCBC\u201d).  (D.I. 16 -1 at Entry No. 1)  On April 26, 2011, the Superior Court \nordered Petitioner to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.  (D.I. 16 -1 at Entry No. 2)   \n The two cases were consolidated and, on June 20, 2011, a New Castle County grand jury \nindicted Petitioner for charges related to both his October 20, 2010 and February 23, 2011 \narrests. (D.I. 16- 1 at Entr y Nos. 4, 5; D.I. 16 -15 at Entry No. 3)  The existing no- contact \nprovisions remained in effect.  (D.I. 15 at 2)  \n[W]hile incarcerated, [Petitioner] sent [the victim] three letters.  For \neach letter the police charged [Petitioner] with one count of felony \nBreach of Conditions of Bond During Commitment.  He was also \ncharged with Stalking and one count of misdemeanor Non\u2013\nCompliance with Bond Conditions for each of the Facebook messages he sent to [the victim] after the court entered t he bond \ncondition.  At first, [Petitioner]  was found incompetent to stand trial due to \nmental illness. But, after treatment at a separate facility, [Petitioner\u2019s] competency was found restored.  Upon returning to \nthe custody of Delaware Department of Corre ctions, [Petitioner] \nstopped taking his medications and was again found incompetent. 3 He returned to the facility for further treatment and eventually \nagreed to cooperate with the program.   \n Nastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, at *2.    \n \n On May 21, 2012, Petitione r was re -indicted  and charged with twenty- two counts of \nmisdemeanor non- compliance with bond conditions (\u201cNCBC\u201d), one count of stalking, and three \ncounts of felony breach of conditions of bond during commitment (\u201cBCBDC\u201d).  ( See D.I. 16- 2 at \n5; D.I. 16 -5 at 6).\n1  (D.I. 16 -3 at 4 -11; DI. 16- 12 at 24- 31)  In August 2012, Petitioner was \ndeclared competent to stand trial. (D.I. 16- 3 at Entry Nos. 37, 38); see also  Nastatos , 2019 WL \n7041891, at *2.  Petitioner\u2019s case proceeded to trial in December 2012 .   \nDuring trial, [Petitioner\u2019s]  counsel objected to the admission of \nthirty -eight emails, Facebook messages, and letters sent by \n[Petitioner] for the failure to properly authenticate them. The court \nconditionally admitted all thirty eight, but later decided to exclude \nsix and instructed the jury not to consider the six rejected messages.  \n \nNastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, at *2.  On December 19, 2012, the jury found Petitioner gui lty of \nthree counts of felony BCBDC, one count of harassment (as a lesser -inclu ded-offense of \nstalking), and sixteen counts of misdemeanor NCBC.  (D.I. 16- 15 at 38 -39)  The Superior Court \nsentenced Petitioner on March 1, 2013 to sixteen years at Level V, to be followed by decreasing \n \n1The State asserts, and the record reveals, that the State nolle prossed six counts of NCBC after \nexhibits were excluded at trial, and the jury found Petitioner guilty of sixteen counts of NCBC.  (D.I. 15 at 3; D.I 16 -1 at Entry No. 50; D.I. 16- 15 at 26)  Y et, the Re -Indictment in the state court \nrecord \u2013 which is timestamped May 21, 2012 \u2013 only lists sixteen counts of NCBC.  (D.I. 16- 3 at \n4-11; DI.16- 12 at 24- 31)  Given the discrepancy (twenty -two counts vs. sixteen counts of \nNCBC) , it appears t hat the copy  of the Re -Indictment in the record is actually a copy of the \nversion of the Re -Indictment that the Superior Court provided to the jury for its deliberations \u2013 \nafter six counts of NCBC had been withdrawn \u2013 rather than the original Re -Indictment  with the \ntwenty-two counts of NCBC .  This conclusion is supported by the fact that,  when instructing the \njury, the Superior Court stated, \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, I have what has \u2013 will come back to you as the indictment, and there are 20 counts here. \u2026 There are certain omissions which have been \nstricken by the Court upon motion of the parties, or the State. \u2026 You need not wonder why any action to exclude a particular count or charge was taken. \u201d  (D.I. 16 -5 at 29)    \n  4 levels of supervision.  (D.I. 16 -12 at 159- 167)  Pe titioner appealed.  On April 15, 2014, the \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions and sentences.  See Nastatos v. State , \n91 A.3d 562 (Table), 2014 WL 1512887, at *6 (Del. Apr. 15, 2014).    \n On April 8, 2015, Petitioner filed a pro se  motion for postconviction relief pursuant to \nDelaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion), followed by a motion for the \nappointment of counsel.  (D.I. 16- 1 at Entry No. 13; D.I. 16 -19)  The Superior Court appointed \npostconviction counsel, who fi led an amended Rule 61 motion on September 1, 2016.  (D.I. 16-\n13 at 3- 54)  Petitioner\u2019s trial and appellate counsel filed Rule 61 affidavits  in response to \nPetitioner\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance .  (D.I. 16- 13 at 55- 61)  The State filed its \nresponse on September 19, 2017.  (D.I. 16- 15 at 40- 103)  The Superior Court held an evidentiary \nhearing on July 23, 2018, during which Petitioner\u2019s trial and appellate counsel each testified.  (D.I. 16- 12 at 120- 33)  On May 13, 2019, the Superior Court denied Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion.  \nSee State v. Nastatos , 2019 WL 2092016 (Del. Super. Ct. May 13, 2019).  The Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed that decision on December 20, 2019.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, \nat *7.   II. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES  \n \nA.  Exhaustion a nd Procedural Default  \n \n Absent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the \npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law.  See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); \nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel , 526 U.S. 838, 842- 44 (1999);  Picard v. Connor , 404 U.S. 270, 275 \n(1971).  The United States Code s tates in pertinent part: \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that \u2013 5  \n(A) the applic ant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts \nof the State; or  \n \n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or \n(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to \nprotect the rights of the applicant. \n \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).  This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of comity, gives \u201cstate \ncourts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d  O\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844- 45; see Werts v. \nVaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000).    A petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the habeas claims \nwere \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct appeal or in a post -conviction \nproceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court to consider the claims on their merits.  See Bell v. Cone , 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989).  If \nthe petitioner raised the issu e on direct appeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is \nexhausted and the petitioner does not need to raise the same issue again in a state post -conviction \nproceeding.  See Lambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997).  \nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and further state \ncourt review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the federal court will excuse \nthe failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted  but procedurally defaulted.  See Coleman \nv. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750- 51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet[] the technical requirements \nfor exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer available); see also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 \nU.S. 81, 92- 93 (2006).  Such claims, however, are procedurally defaulted.  See Coleman , 501 \nU.S. at 749; Lines v. Larkins , 208 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 2000).  Similarly, if a petitioner \npresents a habeas claim to the state\u2019s highest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses 6 to review the merits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the \nclaim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted.  See Coleman , 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed , \n489 U.S. 255, 260- 64 (1989).   \nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the \npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the court does not rev iew the \nclaims.  See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750- 51; McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  To demonstrate cause for a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome \nobjective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986).  To demonstrate actual \nprejudice, a petitioner must show that the errors during his trial created more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that the errors \u201cworked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, \ninfecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d  Id. at 494  (emphasis omitted) .   \n Alternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has probably \nresulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d\n2 then a federal court can excuse the \nprocedural default  and review the claim in order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  \nSee Edwards v. Carpenter , 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank , 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d \nCir. 2001).  The miscarriage of justice exception applies only in extraordinary case s, and actual \ninnocence means factual innocence, not legal insufficiency.  See Bousley v. United States , 523 \nU.S. 614, 623 (1998); Murray , 477 U.S. at 496.  A petitioner establishes actual innocence by \nasserting \u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpa tory scientific evidence, trustworthy \n \n2Murray , 477 U.S. at 496.  7 eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence \u2014that was not presented at trial,\u201d showing that \nno reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  \nSee Hubbard v. Pinchak , 378 F.3d 333, 339- 40 (3d Cir. 2004). \nB.  Standard of Review  \n \nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the federal \ncourt must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).  Pursuant to 28 U .S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if the state court\u2019s \ndecision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or the state c ourt\u2019s decision was \nan unreasonable determination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see also Williams v. Taylor , 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000);  Appel v. Horn, 250 \nF.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001).   \nA claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) if \nthe state court decision finally resolves the claim \u201con the basis of its substance, rather than on a procedural , or other , ground.\u201d   Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. 2009).  The \ndeferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s order is unaccompanied by \nan opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d   Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S. 86, \n98 (2011) .  As explained  in Harrington, \u201cit may be pr esumed that the state court adjudicated the \nclaim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state -law procedural principles to the \ncontrary.\u201d  Id.  at 99.  The Supreme Court expanded the purview of the Richter  presumption in \nJohnson v. Williams , 568 U.S. 289 (2013).  Pursuant to Johnson, if a petitioner has presented the \nclaims raised in a federal habeas application to a state court, and the state court opinion addresses \nsome but not all of those claims, the federal habeas court must presume (subject  to rebuttal) that 8 the state court adjudicated the unaddressed federal claims on the merits.  Id . at 298- 301.  The \nconsequence of this presumption is that the federal habeas court will then be required to review \nthe previously unaddressed claims under \u00a7 2254(d) whereas, in the past, federal habeas courts often assumed \u201cthat the state court simply overlooked the federal claim[s] and proceed[ed] to adjudicate the claim[s] de novo .\u201d  Id . at 292-93.   \nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must  presume that the state \ncourt's determinations of factual issues are correct.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).  This presumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is only rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the  contrary.  See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); Miller -El \nv. Cockrell , 537 U.S. 322, 341 (2003)  (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 \n2254(e)(1) applies to factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to fact ual decisions) ; Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000) .  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n \nThe Petition  asserts the following s even  grounds for relief:   (1) trial counsel provided \nineffective assistance (D.I. 3 at 5 -10); (2) the State violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 \n(1963) by failing to supply trial counsel with copies of the victim\u2019s cell phone records (D.I. 3 at \n12); (3) Petitioner\u2019s  right to a fair trial was denied due to cumulative error ( id. at 15); (4) \nappellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise the issue of cumulative error \non direct appeal ( id. at 15); (5) due to appellate counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance, Petitioner  is \nentitled to a new sentencing hearing before a different judge ( id. at 17); (6) the Superior Court \nviolated Petitioner\u2019s  Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by allowing the State to introduce \nthirty -eight documents without properly authenticating them ( id. at 19); and (7) the Superior \nCourt sentenced Petitioner  with a closed mind and based the sentence on impermissible and 9 erroneous facts, and his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and \nunusual punishment ( id. at 21).   \nA. Claim One:  Inef fective Assistance of Trial Counsel  \n \nPetitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance  (\u201cIATC\u201d) by: (1) \nfailing to request a limiting instruction and/or failing to limit the State\u2019s references to prior bad acts or mental health issues  during the trial ; (2) failing to object to Officer Clarke\u2019s \nimpermissible hearsay testimony; (3) failing to object to repeated prejudicial errors the State committed while questioning the victim; and (4) failing to object to the trial court\u2019s inadequate limiting instruction on inadmissible evidence.  Petitioner presented each of these arguments to the Superior Court in his Rule 61 motion and to the Delaware Supreme Court on post -conviction \nappeal.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at * 9-10; Nastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, at *3- 4.  Both \ncourts denied Petitioner\u2019s IATC allegations in Claim One as meritless.  Consequently, Claim \nOne will only warrant habeas relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, c learly established federal law.  \nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective assistance of trial \nclaims is the two -pronged standard enunciated by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) \nand its progeny.  See Wiggins v. Smith , 539 U.S. 510 (2003) .  Under the first Strickland prong, a \npetitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with reasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel rendered assistance.  See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688.  Under the second Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s \nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have bee n different.\u201d  Id.  at 694.  A \nreasonable probability is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d  Id.    10 In order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must make \nconcrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk summary dismissal.  See \nWells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259- 60 (3d Cir. 1991); Dooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891- 92 \n(3d Cir. 1987).  Although not insurmountable, the Strickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a strong presumption that the representation was professionally reasonable .  See \nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 689.  A court may deny an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by only deciding one of the Strickland prongs.  See Strickland , 466 U.S. at 697.   \nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that the Delaware \nSupreme Court correctly identified the Strickland standard applicable to P etitioner\u2019s IATC  \nallegation s.  Consequently, the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not c ontrary to clearly \nestablished federal law.   See Williams , 529 U.S. at 406 (\u201c[A] run- of-the-mill state -court decision \napplying the correct legal rule from [Supreme Court] cases to the facts of a prisoner\u2019s case [does] \nnot fit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause\u201d).   \nThe Court\u2019s inquiry is not over, however, because it must also determine if the Delaware \nSupreme Court reasonably applied the  Strickland standard to the facts of Petitioner\u2019s case.   See \nHarrington, 562 U.S. at 105- 06.  When performing this inquiry, the Court must review the \nDelaware state courts\u2019  denial of Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel allegations through \na \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens.\n3  Id.  \u201c[T]he question is not whether counsel's actions were \n \n3As explained by the Richter  Court,  \nThe standards created by Strickland and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u201chighly \ndeferential,\u201d and when the two apply in tandem, review is \u201c doubly\u201d  \nso.  The Strickland standard is a general one, so the range of \nreasonable applications is substantial.  Federal habeas courts must \nguard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under Strickland with unreasonableness under \u00a7 2254(d).   \n Richter , 562 U.S. at 105 (inter nal citations omitted).  11 reason able, [but rather], whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied \nStrickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d   Id.  When assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question \nis \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result would have been different\u201d but for counsel\u2019s \nperformance, and the \u201clikelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\u201d  Id.  And finally, when viewing a state court\u2019s determination that a Strickland claim lacks merit \nthrough the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal ha beas relief is precluded \u201cso long as fairminded jurists \ncould disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d  Id . at 101.   \nThe Superior Court denied all four allegations of IATC for failing to satisfy the prejudice \nprong of Strickland without  addressing Strickland \u2019s performance prong.  The Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed th e Superior Court\u2019s decision while also only considering Strickland \u2019s prejudice \nprong, and denied all four allegations of IATC after determining that Petitioner could not show he was prejudiced.  The fact that the Delaware state courts only considered the prejudice prong \nof the Strickland standard without addressing trial counsel\u2019s actions under Strickland\u2019s \nperformance prong does not amount to an unreasonable application of Strickland.  See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697; United States v. Lilly , 536 F.3d 190, 196 (3d Cir. 2008) (\u201cOur Court \nhas endorsed the practical suggestion in Strickland that we may consider the prejudice prong before examining the performance of counsel prong because this course of action is less burdensome to defense counsel.\u201d) (cleaned up).  Nevertheless , the Court must still determine if \nthe Delaware state courts unreasonably applied Strickland when conclud ing that Petitioner did \nnot demonstrate he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s purported errors.     \nGiven the overlap between the IATC issues and evidence, the state courts addressed all \nfour of Petitioner\u2019s IATC allegations at once, rather than separately, when concluding that \nPetitioner was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s actions.  For ease of analysis, the Court will 12 utilize the same approach  after providing separate summaries of Petitioner\u2019s four IATC \nallegations.  \n1. Trial counsel failed to limit the State\u2019s references to bad acts and mental \nhealth issues  during the trial  \n During Petitioner\u2019s trial, the State admitted several statements that included Petitioner\u2019s \ncomments  about previously being incarcerated and possibl e mental illness.  The comments were \nwritten by Petitioner in documents to the victim, and included the following:  \n\u2022 \u201c[b]ut I did go to jail\u201d  \n\u2022  \u201cagain I\u2019ll be in Gander\u201d  \n\u2022  \u201cI\u2019ve been in jail before, longest bit , one year.   A lot of \npeople can\u2019t handle jail, it definitely tests  a person. Though \nI\u2019d rather be free, I\u2019m fine.\u201d  \n \n(D.I. 16- 18 at 47, 61, 70)  \n \n\u2022  \u201c[f]irst, I have an OCD\u201d  \u2022  \u201cI ended up in a hospital\u201d  \n \u2022  \u201cI woke up in Meadow Wood\u201d  \n \u2022  \u201c[w]hen I was in Meadow Wood\u201d  \n \u2022  \u201cI was diagnosed delusional\u201d  \n \u2022  \u201c[t]hey sent us to S tate Hospital \u2013 they sent me to the \nState Hospital for treatment because I believe the above statement. They pumped me full of drugs for months .\u201d \n (D.I. 16- 18 at 50, 57, 58, 60, 68)  The comments were read into evidence during the State\u2019s case-\nin-chief  to prove the elements of the charged offenses.  (D.I. 16- 12 at 45- 77)  Trial counsel \nobjected to the introduction of every piece of evidence related to the messages Petitioner sent to \nthe victim based on lack of f oundation.  (D.I. 16 -12 at 52- 77)  When the State brought up the 13 concerning references (D.I. 16 -20 at 2- 3), the Superior Court noted that the comments were \nlikely not inadmissible under Delaware Rule of Evidence 404(b), but that it might be willing to \ngene rally instruct the jury at the end of the trial not to use such information for an improper \npurpose.  (D.I. 16 -20 at 3 )  The Superior Court conditionally admitted the evidence, giving the \nState the opportunity to lay a complete foundation.  (D.I. 16- 12 at 52-77)  All but six of the \ndocuments were ultimately admitted.  (D.I. 16 -4 at 68- 72; D.I. 16- 15 at 15- 20)  When the time \ncame to request a curative instruction, trial counsel stated that he was not ask ing for it .  (D.I. 16-\n15 at 28)   In his Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that the statements should have been excluded as \nimpermissible prior bad acts and character evidence and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the statements or to request a limiting instruction.  (D.I. 16- 11 at 16; D.I. 16-\n13 at 20- 23)   \n2. Trial counsel failed to object to Officer Clarke\u2019s hearsay testimony  \n \n During direct examination of Officer Clark e, the State elicited testimony about prior \nconsistent statements the victim had made to the police o fficer.  (D.I. 16- 19 at 2, 4- 5)  Although \ntrial counsel did not object to those portions of Officer Clark e\u2019s testimony, the statements were \nhearsay and were not admitted under 11 Del. Code \u00a7 3507.  (D.I. 15 at 16)  In his Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the statements.  (D.I. 16- 11 at 16; D.I. 16 -3 at 24- 29)  \n3. Trial counsel failed to object to the victim\u2019s comments during direct \nexamination  \n \nThe victim testified that she had received text messages from Petitioner.  (D.I. 16 -12 at \n38)  Trial counsel objected because the State had presented nothing, other than the victim\u2019s 14 belief, to prove that the texts were from Petitioner.  ( Id.)  The Superior Court overruled the \nobjection, and the State elicited additional testimony that the victim and Petitioner had \nexchanged telephone numbers and that the number the text s came from was the number provided \nby Petitioner.  ( Id.)  The victim further testified that the text message about a secret admire r \ncame from the phone number that Petitioner had provided to her as his number.  ( Id.)  The victim \nstated that she and Petitioner also had an in- person conversation about the content of the text \nmessages concernin g flower petals on her car.  (D.I 16 -12 at 39)  This additional testimony laid \nthe foundation for the testimony that the victim received multiple text messages from Petitioner.  \nThe victim also testified about numerous messages she received on Facebook.  A lthough \nthe victim initially testified that the messages were from Petitioner, the Superior Court corrected her and she then testified that the messages purported to be from Petitioner.  (D.I. 16- 12 at 50, \n56, 60- 77)  In his Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing \nto object to the victim\u2019s impermissible comments that the messages had come from Petitioner. (D.I. 16- 11 at 16; D.I. 16 -13 at 30- 32) \n4. Trial counsel failed to object to the \u201cgeneric and unspecified\u201d curative \ninstruction  \n \nDuring trial, the State introduced thirty -five Facebook documents, which the Superior \nCourt conditionally admitted to allow the State to establish a foundation. (D.I. 16- 12 at 52- 77)  \nAfter briefing and argument, the Superior Court admitted al l but six of the thirty -five documents.  \n(D.I. 16- 4 at 68- 72)  The Superior Court excluded three of those exhibits (exhibits 3, 15, and 19) \nbecause they  were not \u201c probative of much, \u201d one of the exhibits  (exhibit 28) because there was \nnot sufficient informa tion to conclude it had come from Petitioner, and the other two of the six \nexhibits (exhibits 29 and 30) \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d  (D.I. 16- 4 at 70- 71)  15 Before deliberations, the Superior Court instructed the jury: \u201cYou are instructed that the \nState\u2019s offer of evidence of six Facebook messages has been denied by the Court.  That \ninformation is not part of the record in this case.  It cannot therefore be considered by you for \nany purpose.\u201d  (D.I. 16 -15 at 36)  In his Rule 61 motion, Petitioner claim ed that trial counsel was \nineffective for failing to object to the limiting instruction because it was not sufficient to cure any prejudice resulting from the excluded evidence that the jury heard.  (D.I. 16 -11 at 16; D.I. 16- 13 \nat 33 -35)   \n5. Delaware courts \u2019 adjudication of the four IATC allegations  \n \nAs previously explained, the Superior Court did not evaluate trial counsel \u2019s actions \nunderlying the four IATC allegations in Claim One under Strickland\u2019s p erformance prong.  \nInstead, the Superior Court held that Petitioner could not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any of those purported errors on trial counsel\u2019s part.   \nThe Superior  Court considered the allegations related to  the NCBC and BCBDC charges \nfirst, explaini ng that the State only needed to show that Petitioner had breached a condition of \nrelease or bail, in this case, a no -contact order.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at *10.  The \nSuperior Court noted that  there was \u201cextensive and incontrovertible\u201d evidence of Petitioner\u2019s \ncontact with the victim in breach of the no- contact orders,  and the \u201conly issue for both the \nBC[B]DC and NCBC charges was whether [Petitioner] knowingly had contact with\u201d the victim.  \nNastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at *10.  During closing argument, trial counsel argued that the \nState should have gone to greater lengths to prove that the communications came from someone impersonating him .  The  Superior Court rejected th e defense theory of impersonation, opining:  \nNo reasonable juror would consider that explanation as raising a \nreasonable doubt of [Petit ioner\u2019s] guilt.  Thus, it  is clear [\u2026] that \nthe jury's verdicts on the BC [B]DC and NC BC counts [were] not 16 affected by knowing that [Petitioner] had been incarcerated and had \nment al health issues, any alleged improper hearsay testimony from \nOfficer Clarke, any alleged improper questioning of the complaining witness on direct examination, or the absence of an adequate limiting or cautionary instruction. In short, the evidence \nagains t [Petitioner] on these counts was so strong that any [of] the \nclaimed performance errors by Trial Counsel had no bearing on the \njury's verdicts.  There is very little chance the outcome would have been different.  \n \nNastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at *10. \n The S uperior Court then turned to the stalking charge , which alleged that Petitioner: \u201c (1) \nknowingly engaged in a course of conduct; (2) directed at [ the victim] ; (3) that would cause a \nreasonable person to fear physical injury or suffer other significant menta l anguis h or distress; \nand (4) that [ Petitioner ] violated a no  contact order .\u201d  Nastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at *10.  \nSince \u201c the only real controverted issue \u201d on the stalking  charge was the effect Petitioner\u2019s \nconduct had on the victim, the jury was instructed on the lesser included offense of harassment .  \nSee id .  Relevantly, the lesser included offense required proof that:  (1) Petitioner  communicated \nwith another person\u2014the  victim\u2014by any form of written or electronic communication; (2) in a \nmanner which he knows; (3) is likely to cause annoyance or alarm.  See id .  Petitioner was \nconvicted of harassment but not of stalking. The Superior Court concluded that Petitioner failed \nto establish prejudice under Strickland because trial counsel had successfully convinced the jury not to convict Petitioner of the more serious charge , and because Petitioner \u2019s theory of defense  to \nharassment  was the same implausible  argument of impersona tion.  See id.  \nThe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the  Superior Court\u2019s judgment  on post -conviction \nappeal , finding:  \n[T]he Superior Court relied on an abundance of evidence supporting \nthe jury's findings. [Petitioner]  admitted to sending messages and \nletters to [the victim] , numerous witnesses testified that Petitioner  17 pursued [the victim] , and the jury responded to [Petitioner\u2019s] \narguments about the level of harm by reducing the Stalking charge \nto Harassment.  While the Superior Court stated at trial it was near \nthe end of its patience with defense counsel's errors, we agree with the Superior Court's conclusion here that there was  sufficient \nevidence to justify a conviction even with all of the alleged errors. \nThe Superior Court analyzed the claims and reached a conclusion \nsupported by the record\u2014it did not abuse its discretion when determining that [Petitioner] failed to sh ow prejudice from the \nalleged errors.  \n \nNastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, at *5.  \n  \nIn order to prove the charges of NCBC, the State had to show that , while he was \ncommitted in default of bail,  Petitioner knowingly breached a condition of bail in connection \nwith a  felony.  See 11 Del. Code \u00a7 2113(c); 11 Del. Code \u00a7 2109(c).  Here, it was undisputed that \nthere was a no -contact order in place while Petitioner was confined in default of bail on a felony \ncharge of stalking.  Consequently, the only issue was whether Pet itioner knowingly had contact \nwith the victim. \nAfter reviewing the record, the Court concludes that the Delaware courts reasonably \ndetermined the facts when it found that Petitioner was the person who sent the messages and \nletters to the victim.  The State proved Petitioner\u2019s contacts with the victim through texts from a \ntelephone number he had represented as his own, Facebook messages from an account in his name bearing his photo, and handwritten letters addressed from him with his return address, connected to him by the content of the writing.  Additionally, i n his police interview, Petitioner \nadmitted that he contacted the victim repeatedly by text and through Facebook messages.  This \nevidence clearly demonstrated that Petitioner contacted the victim on numerous occasions.   \nIn turn, given the strength of the foregoing evidence, the Delaware state courts reasonably \napplied Strickland when holding that  Petitioner did not  demonstrate  a reasonable probability that 18 trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to or address the following purported errors negati vely affected \nthe determination that Petitioner contacted the victim many times in breach of the no -contact \norders: (1) the State \u2019s assertio ns during trial that Petitioner referred  in his communication s about  \nhaving been in jail and having mental health issues; (2) an officer \u2019s testi mony about prior \nstatements made by the victim which were consistent with her testimony; (3) the fact that the \nvictim initially stated that the communications came from Petitioner, instead of saying they purportedly  came from Petitioner ; and (4)  the fact that trial court only gave one instruction about \nthe few excluded Facebook communications.  \nFurther , trial counsel\u2019s strategy with respect to the stalking charge was to demonstrate \nthat Petitioner\u2019s communications did not place the victim in fear, but were merely annoying or alarming.   The fact that the jury convicted Petitioner of harassment instead of stalking i ndicates \nthat trial counsel\u2019s strategy was successful,, and suggests that trial counsel\u2019s other four purported \nerrors did not affect the verdict.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at *10.  \nGiven these circumstances, the Court concludes that the Del aware state courts reasonably \napplied Strickland when concluding that Petitioner did not satisfy the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.  Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim One  for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d) .  \nB. Claim Two:  Brady  Violation  \n \nIn Clai m Two, Petitioner contends that the State violated Brady  by failing to supply trial \ncounsel with copies of the victim\u2019s cell phone rec ords, which Petitioner  asserts may have \ncontained Brady material.  (D.I. 16 -13 at 36- 41)  Petitioner presented this argume nt in his Rule \n61 motion, and the Superior Court denied it as procedurally barred under Delaware Superior \nCourt Criminal Rule 61(i)(3) because Petitioner did not raise the issue in the proceedings leading \nto his judgment of conviction.  Petitioner presented the same argument to the Delaware Supreme 19 Court on post -conviction appeal, and also alleged that the Superior Court denied his right to due \nprocess by not allowing him access to  his cell phone records during the Rule 61 proceeding.  \n(D.I. 16- 11 at 34- 36)  The Delaware Supreme Court noted that the Superior Court incorrectly \napplied an earlier version of Rule 61(i)(3) that contained a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception to \nthe bar.  See Nastatos , 2019 W L 7041891, at *5 n.  35.  Nevertheless , the Delaware Supreme \nCourt still concluded that Claim Two was procedurally barred under the correct version of Rule 61(i)(3).  See id . at *5.   \nBy applying the procedural bar of Rule 61(i)(3), the Delaware Supreme Court articulated \na \u201cplain statement\u201d under Harris v. Reed  that its decision rested on state law grounds.  This \nCourt has consistently held that Rule 61(i)(3) is an independent and adequate state procedural \nrule precluding federal habeas review.  See Robinson v. Metzger , 2020 WL 1248198, at *4 (D. \nDel. Mar. 16, 2020);  McCleaf v. Carroll , 416 F. Supp. 2d 283, 296 (D. Del. 2006).  Thus, the \nCourt cannot review the merits of C laim Two absent a showing of cause for the default, and \nprejudice resulting therefrom, or upon a showing that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the claim is not reviewed.  \nPetitioner attempts to establish cause  because appellate counsel  did not  raise the c laim on \ndirect appeal.  ( See D.I. 3 at 13)  Petitioner never presented an ineffective assistance of appellate \ncounsel claim based on appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise a Brady  violation in his state collateral \nproceeding or in his subsequent post -conviction appeal.  Consequently, this ineffective assistance \nof counsel alleg ation is itself procedurally defaulted,\n4 and cannot excuse P etitioner\u2019s procedural \ndefault of the substantive Brady  claim.   See Edwards , 529 U.S. at  453- 54.   \n \n4See Del. Super. Crim. R. 61(i)(1), (2).  20 In the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue of prejudice.  Additionally, \nthe miscarriage of justice exception to the procedural default doctrine is inapplicable because \nPetitioner has failed to provide new reliable evidence of his actual innocence.  Therefore, the Court will deny Claim Two as procedurally barred. \nC. Claim Three:  Cumulative Error  \n \nPetitioner argues that was denied his right to a fair trial because of  a cumulative due \nprocess error.  (D.I. 3 at 14)  Petitioner presented a subs tantially similar argument in his Rule 61 \nmotion .  Although the Superior Court did not specifically address Petitioner\u2019s cumulative error \nargument, it considered Petit ioner\u2019s  six IATC allegations cumulatively  in finding that he failed to \ndemonstrate prejudice from the alleged errors.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at *9-10. The \nSuperior Court held that the alleged errors had little to no influence on the outcome of Petitioner\u2019s case, given the limited evidence that was needed to prove the crimes of NCBC an d \nBCBDC, and also as reflected by  the jury convicting Petitioner of the lesser included offense of \nharassment instead of stalking.  See id . at *10.    \nOn postconviction appeal, Petitioner argued that the Superior Court misunderstood some \nof his IATC claims, failed to consider his assertions of prejudice, and overestimated the strength of the State\u2019s case.  (D.I. 16 -11 at 15- 19)  The Delaware Supreme Cour t disagreed, explaining \nthat sufficient evidence supported his convictions and finding that Petitioner failed to show prejudice for his IATC allegations.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, at *4-5.  Given these \ncircumstances , Claim Three will only warrant hab eas relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s \ndecision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. \nThe United States Supreme Court has not recognized the concept of cumulative error.  \nSee Bush v. Carpenter , 926 F.3d 644, 686 n.16 (10th Cir. 2019).  Since there is no clearly 21 established Federal law with respect to a cumulative error argument, it would appear that the \nCourt\u2019s \u00a7 2254(d) analysis is over and Petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief for Claim Three. \nHowever, the Third Circuit has recognized the cumulative error doctrine on habeas \nreview, holding that \u201ca cumulative error argument constitutes a stand- alone constitutional claim \nsubject to exhaustion and procedural default.\u201d  Collins v. Sec'y of Pa. Dep't of Corr. 742 F.3d \n528, 542 (3d Cir. 2014).  Pursuant to the cumulative error doctrine, \nIndividual errors that do not entitle a petitioner to relief may do so \nwhen combined, if cumulatively the prejudice resulting from them \nundermined the fundamental fairness of his trial and denied him his \nconstitutional right to due process. Cumulative errors are not \nharmless if they had a substantial and injurious effect or influence \nin determining the jury's verdict, which means that a habeas \npetitioner is not entitle d to relief based on cumulative errors unless \nhe can establish actual prejudice.  \n \nFahy v. Horn, 516 F.3d 169, 205 (3d Cir.2008).  Given the Third Circuit\u2019s recognition of the \ncumulative error doctrine in habeas proceedings, the Court will exercise prudence and review \nClaim Three.  \nHere, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed and rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201cthe \nspecific effects of each error [by trial counsel] caused individual and cumulative prejudice.\u201d  \nNastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, at *4-5.  As previously discussed, this Court has also concluded \nthat the errors alleged in Petitioner\u2019s IATC c laim did not cause any prejudice.  Petitioner has not \nprovided anything in this proceeding to demonstrate \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d  Therefore, the Court \nwill deny Claim Three as meritless.  \nD. Claim Four:  Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel  \n \nIn Claim Four, P etitioner contends that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to \nraise the issue of cumulative error on direct appeal.  (D.I. 3 at 15)  Petitioner presented this \nargument in his Rule 61 motion.  In her Rule 61 Affidavit, appellate counsel asserted that she did 22 not raise the issue of cumulative error because there was little chan ce of success for such an \nargument on direct appeal based on issues not preserved at trial.   (D.I. 16- 3 at 60)  The S uperior \nCourt rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument after finding that appellate counsel made a reasonable \nstrategic decision as to which arguments to raise on appeal.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at \n*12.  The Superior Court also concluded that Petitioner coul d not satisfy the prejudice prong of \nthe Strickland standard.  See id.   The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court \u2019s \ndecision on postconviction appeal, noting that the Superior Court properly relied on appellate counsel\u2019s Rule 61 affidavit when finding that she did not render ineffective assistance by opting not to pursue a cumulative error argument.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 7041891, at *6.    \nClaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are evaluated under the same \nStrickland standard ap plicable to trial counsel.  See Lewis v. Johnson, 359 F.3d 646, 656 (3d Cir. \n2004).  An attorney's decision about which issues to raise on appeal are strategic,\n5 and an \nattorney is not required to raise every possible non- frivolous issue on appeal .   See Jones v. \nBarnes , 463 U.S. 745 (1983); Smith v. Robbins , 528 U.S. 259, 272 (2000).  In the appellate \ncontext, the test for prejudice under Strickland \u201cis not whether petitioners would likely prevail upon remand, but whether [the court of appeals] would have  likely reversed and ordered a \nremand had the issue been raised on direct appeal.\u201d   United States v. Mannino, 212 F.3d 835, 844 \n(3d Cir. 2000); see also Smith , 528 U.S. at  287- 88 (explaining that the question when \ndetermining prejudice in the appellate context is whether the issues counsel did not raise \u201cwere \nclearly stronger\u201d than the issues counsel did raise).    \n \n5See Albrecht v. Horn , 485 F.3d 103, 138 (3d Cir. 2007); Buehl v. Vaughn, 166 F.3d 163, 174 \n(3d Cir. 1999)  (stating counsel is afforded reasonable selectivity in deciding which claims to \nraise without specter of being labeled ineffective) . 23 The record \u2013 including appellate counsel\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing and the \nissues she raised on appeal \u2013 demonstrate s that appellate counsel identified and thoroughly \nreviewed the possible issues to present.  (D.I. 16 -13 at 131- 32)  The Delaware state courts found \nappellate counsel\u2019s a ssertions to be credible, and Petitioner has not provided any clear and \nconvincing evidence to contradict that factual determination of credibility .  See Vickers v. Sup\u2019t \nGraterford SCI , 858 F.3d 841, 850 n.9 (3d Cir. 2017) (noting credibility findings are presumed \ncorrect absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary).  Appellate counsel chose to \nadvance what she deduced were the most meritorious claims, and the fact that she determined the \ncumulative error argument to lack merit does not mean that she provided ineffective assistance.  Notably, Petitioner has not demonstrated that his cumulative err or argument is nonfrivolous, or \nthat it would have been stronger on appeal than the issues appellate counsel did raise.  Given these circumstances, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts reasonably applied \nStrickland when denying Claim Four. \nE. Claim Five:  New Sentencing Hearing  \n \nNext, Petitioner contends that  he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing under the Sixth \nand Fourteenth Amendments  if the Court does not grant him relief for his other c laims .  (D.I. 3 at \n17)  Although not entire ly clear, Petitioner appears to base this c laim on the argument he \npresented on post -conviction appeal, namely, that appellate counsel was ineffective on direct \nappeal by arguing \u201c that the trial judge sentenced [ Petitioner ] with a closed mind while \nsimulta neously omitting a significant portion of the sentencing record that substantiated [ her \nargume nt].\u201d  (D.I. 16 -11 at 44)   \nIn his Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that appellate counsel provided ineffective \nassistance on direct appeal by \u201c arguing that the sentencing judge was prejudiced and sentenced 24 [Petitioner] [ with] a closed mind [\u2026 but omitted] the significant issue of the inappropriate \ncomments trial counsel alleged the [Superior] Court made prior to sentencing.\u201d  (D.I. 16 -13 at \n46)  The Superior Cour t viewed Petitioner\u2019s argument as alleging  that he was entitled to a new \nsentencing hearing because appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a \nmotion to recuse the trial judge .  (D.I . 16-13 at 46 -51)  The Superior Court rejected the \nargument, noting that the Delaware Supreme Court  had already determined that the Superior \nCourt did not sentence Petitioner  with a  closed mind.  See Nastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at *12.  \nThe Superior Court also rejected Petiti oner\u2019s recusal argu ment because \u201cit is the identical \nargument renamed.\u201d  Id.   \nPetitioner appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court, arguing that the Superior Court had \nincorrectly construed his true argument.  The  Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior  \nCourt\u2019s denial of the c laim, but for a different reason:  \nFinally, [Petitioner]  argues that the Superior Court erred when it \ndenied his claim asserting that he is entitled to a new sentencing \nhearing because the court misunderstood his argument. First, he argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion for recusal prior to the start of the sentencing hearing.  And second, he argues appellate counsel was ineffective for unreasonably limiting the scope of the sentencing argument raised on direct appeal and omitting a significant factual component of the issue. He properly raised these issues to the Superior Court.  The Superior Court found that these arguments were identical to the issue on direct appeal \u2014whether the trial court sentenced  him with a \nclosed mind and based on impermissible and erroneous facts \u2014and \naccordingly found the arguments had no merit.  While we find that \nthe arguments were not identical, we agree with the result.  \n For this ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, [Petitioner] notes that the sentencing judge denied actual bias, and we affirmed that the trial court did not sentence him with a closed mind or impermissible and erroneous facts.  [Petitioner]  argues  that a motion \nfor recusal would have been successful because of the appearance 25 of bias. But, even if a motion for recusal would have been \nsuccessful, [Petitioner] does not effectively argue that a similarly \nnon-biased sentencing judge would have reached a  different \nsentencing result.  Because [Petitioner]  fails to show that but for the \ntrial counsel's error, the resulting sentence would have been \ndifferent, his claim fails under Strickland.  \n \nHis ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim fails for t he \nsame reasons his other ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims fail. Appellate counsel is not required to make  every \nargument. In addition to appellate counsel's affidavit, counsel's \nbriefing at the time indicates she was informed on the reco rd, thus \naffording her strategy substantial deference.  [Petitioner]  argues that \nthere was no rational basis for not raising this issue and its omission made the appeal deficient. But, there are a multitude of rational reasons to not raise this issue, and omitting potentially meritorious evidence does not make the argument deficient. He does not overcome the substantial presumption that counsel's strategy was within the range of reasonableness, and the claim fails under Strickland.  \nNastatos , 2019 WL 2092016, at *6- 7.   \n During Petitioner\u2019s  Rule 61 evidentiary hearing, appellate counsel testified that she \npursued the \u201c sentencing -with-a-closed -mind argument \u201d on direct appeal because she believed it \nhad merit.  (D.I. 16 -13 at 132)   In her Rule 61 affidavit, appellate counsel explained:  \n14.  Appellate counsel identified several errors in the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision that led to an unusually harsh sentence.  Thus, counsel argued that the trial court sentenced [Petitioner] with a closed mind and bas ed on impermissible and erroneous factors.  \n 15.  Counsel did not ident ify any other issues that she felt had a \nchance of success on its own or that added value to the issues that she did raise.  \n \n(D.I. 16- 13 at 60)  This record demonstrates that appellate counsel analyzed the possible \narguments to present on direct appeal and made a purposeful  decision not to present issues she \ndid not deem possibly meritorious or relevant  to the arguments she decided to pursue.  Moreover, \nPetitioner has not demonstrated that the Delaware Supreme Court would likely have reversed 26 and ordered a remand if appellate counsel had included the factual information he believes would \nhave supported his argument.  Based on this record, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Cour t did not unreasonably apply Strickland when denying the argument in Claim Five . \nF. Claim Six:  Unauthenticated Documents  \n \nIn Claim Six, Petitioner contends that the admission of multiple Facebook message s and \nletters he sent to the victim violated his constitutional rights because those items were not properly authenticated.  Although Petitioner initially raised this same c laim on direct appeal, he \nvoluntarily withdrew it before the Delaware Supreme Court decided his case.  As a result, Petitioner has not exhausted state remedies for Claim Six.  \nPetitioner cannot return to the Superior Court to present this unexhausted argument, \nbecause a Rule 61 motion would be barred as untimely under Rule 61(i)(1) and successive under Rule 61( i)(2).  Altho ugh Rule 61(i)(1) provides for an exception to the one -year time limitation if \nthe untimely Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a retroactively applicable right that is newly recognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\u201d no such right is implicated in the ins tant argument.  \nSimilarly, the exceptions to Rule 61(i)(1)\u2019s time -bar and 61(i)(2)\u2019s successive bar contained in \nRule 61(i)(5) and (d)(2) do not apply to Petitioner\u2019s case, because he does not allege a credible claim of actual innocence, lack of jurisdicti on, or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to \nthe instant argument.  Given these circumstances, the Court must treat Claim  Six as exhausted \nbut procedurally defaulted, meaning that the Court cannot review the merits of the c laim absent a \nshowing of cause and prejudice or a miscarriage of justice.  \nTo the extent Petitioner attempts to establish cause under Martinez v. Ryan , 566 U.S. 1, \n8-9 (2012),  by asser ting that postconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to raise Claim Six \nin his Rule 61 proceeding (D.I. 3 at 20), the argument is unavailing.  In Martinez, the Supreme 27 Court held that inadequate assistance or the absence of counsel during an initial -review state \ncollateral proceeding may establish cause for a petitioner =s procedural default of a claim of \nineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Id . at 12, 16 -17.  Here, Claim Six asserts a freestanding \nissue and not ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Therefore, Martinez is inapplicable and does \nnot provide cause for Petitioner\u2019s default.  \nIn the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue.  And, once again, the \nmiscarriage of justice exception does not apply to this case.  Thus, the Court will deny Claim Six \nas procedurally barred.  \nG. Claim Seven :  Sentencing Errors  \n \nIn his final c laim, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court  sentenced him with a closed \nmind, relied  on impermissible information  while sentencing , and \u201cdeviated significantly upward \nfrom the  presumptive sentence of nonviolent felonies and misdemeanors which r esulted  in the \nimposition of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of [his] rights under the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d  (D.I. 3 at 21)  Petitioner presented this c laim on \ndirect appeal.  (D.I. 16 -2 at 18- 31)  The Delaware Supreme Court separately considered the issue \nof whether Petitioner\u2019s sentence violated the Eighth Amendment from his arguments that he was sentenced with a closed mind or  that the sentence was  based on impermissible information.  See \nNastatos , 2014 W L 1512887, at *4- 6.   \nThe Delaware Supreme Court examined the latter arguments under Delaware state law.  \nTo the extent Petitioner\u2019s instant c laim is premised on those arguments, it asserts an error of state \nlaw that is not cognizable on federal habeas review.  See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S 62, 68 (1991) . 28 To the extent  Claim Seven  is based on an Eighth Amendment violation, the Delaware \nSupreme Court denied the argument as meritless.  Therefore, Petitio ner will only be entitled to \nhabeas relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, or an \nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.  \nThe Eighth Amendment forbids cruel and unusual punishment, and it applies to the  States \nvia the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 667 (1962).  Two decisions of the United States Supreme Court summarize the applicable Eighth Amendment principles for non- capital sentencing: Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S. 63 (2003), and Ewing v. \nCalifornia , 538 U.S. 11 (2003).  In Lockyer , the Supreme Court extensively reviewed its prior \ncases dealing with Eighth Amendment challenges to criminal sentences, and concluded that it has \u201cnot established a clear and consistent path for courts to follow\u201d in determining whether a \nparticular sentence for a term of years can violate the Eighth Amendment.\u201d 538 U.S. at 72.  The \nLockyer  Court explained that, for the purposes of analyzing an Eighth Amendment claim under \u00a7 \n2254(d)(1), the onl y clearly established governing legal principle is that \u201cthe gross \ndisproportionality principle, the precise contours of which are unclear, [is] applicable only in the \u2018exceedingly rare\u2019 and \u2018extreme\u2019 case.\u201d  Id. at 73.  The Lockyer Court held that a recid ivist's \nminimum sentence of fifty  years was not grossly disproportionate to the two counts of petty theft \nthat triggered the application of the recidivist statute.  See id . at 67, 77.  \nIn Ewing , the Supreme Court rejected the defendant's claim that a sentence of  twenty -five \nyears to life for stealing three golf clubs was \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to the crime.  538 U.S. at 20, 28.  The Ewing Court reiterated that the Eighth Amendment \u201ccontains a \u2018narrow \nproportionality principle\u2019 that \u2018applies to nonc apital sentences,\u2019\u201d which \u201cdoes not require strict \nproportionality between the crime and the sentence.  Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences 29 that are \u2018grossly disproportionate\u2019 to the crime.\u201d  Id . at 20, 23.  The Ewing  Court explained that a \ncourt engaging in the proportionality analysis must compare the harshness of the penalty \nimposed upon the defendant with the gravity of his triggering offenses and criminal history.  See id. at 28- 29.  \u201cIn weighing the gravity of [the defendant's] offense, [the cou rt] must place on the \nscales not only his current felony, but also his long history of felony recidivism.\u201d  Ewing , 538 \nU.S. at 29. \nThe Delaware Supreme Court cited to Crosby v. State , 824 A.3d 894, 908 (Del. 2003) , \nwhen deciding that Petitioner\u2019s sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment.  This Court has previously held that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s application of the principles arti culated in \nCrosby to Eighth Amendment claims is consistent with the principles articulated in Lockyer  and \nEwing .  See McCleaf v. Carroll , 416 F. Supp. 2d 283, 290- 91 (D. Del. 2006).  Therefore, the \nDelaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case was not contrary to clearly established federal \nlaw.   \nThe Court also concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply \nclearly established federal law when finding that Petit ioner\u2019s sentence was not so extreme as to \nsatisfy the threshold inference of \u201cgross dis proportionality\u201d needed to establish a violation of the \nEighth Amendment.  Notably, Petitioner\u2019s sentence was not disproportionate when viewed in context with the circum stances of his case.   The relevant penalty for each of Petitioner\u2019s three \nfelony BCBDC convictions was zero to five years in prison.  See 11 Del. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2113(c)(1) and 4205(5).  For each conviction, the  Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to two years in prison, \nfollowed by probation.  The penalty for each of Petitioner\u2019s sixteen NCBC misdemeanor \nconvictions was up to one year in jail.  See  11 Del. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2113(c)(2) and 4206(a).  The penalty \nfor harassment also carries up to one year in prison.  See 11 De l. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1311(b) and 4206(a).  30 The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner for harassment and for nine of the NCBC convictions to \none year in prison, and to one year of probation for each of the seven remaining NCBC convictions .  (D.I. 16- 2 at 40- 48)  This r ecord demonstrates that Petitioner\u2019s sentence was within \nthe penalty ranges for his convictions as established by the Delaware General Assembly.   \nAdditionally, w hen sentencing Petitioner, the Superior Court acknowledged that \nPetitioner was being sentenced  outside of Delaware\u2019s sentencing guidelines.  The Superior Court \nmade a full record of its reasons for its upward departure, stating, \u201c So to the extent the sentence \nI\u2019m about to impose exceeds that recommended by SENT AC, I cite excessive cruelty, prior \ncriminal conduct, repetitive criminal conduct, prior criminal conduct, need for correctional treatment, undue depreciation of the offence, custody status at the time of some of the offenses, lack of remorse, lack of amenability, and vulnerability of the victim.\u201d  (D.I. 16- 4 at 78- 79)  The \nSuperior Court concluded by stating:  \nBy my calculation, sir, that comes out to 16 years.  If my math is \ncorrect, that means you\u2019ll serve 12.  I think this is a case that merits a significant and long- term period of incarceration due to your \nrepeated refusal to obey the law and the harm that you have caused to the victim. [\u2026] You could have gotten more, but I thought this was appropriate.  Even though it\u2019s more than what the State asked for, I\u2019m in a position to apply, based on my experience sitting here as a Judge for 23 years, what I consider egregious, intentional, mean -spirited conduct by someone against another person in order \nto obtain some sort of benefit, which I have yet to understand.   \n \n(D.I. 16- 4 at 80)   This record demonstrates that the  Superior Court considered Petitioner\u2019s \nsentence in proportion to the nature of his crimes .   \nGiven these circumstances , the Court cannot conclude that the Delaware Supreme \nCourt erred in concluding that Petitioner\u2019s senten ce di d not create an inference of gross 31 disproportionality.  Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Seven for failing to satisfy \u00a7 \n2254(d).  \nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY  \n \n A district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether \nto issue a certificate of appealability.  See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).  A \ncertificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2);  see \nalso Slack v. McDaniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).  Additionally, when a district court denies a \nhabeas claim or petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the cl aim or petition \nstates a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling.  See Slack v. McDaniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).   \n The Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief.  Reasonable \njurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable.  Accordingly, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.  \nV. CONCLUSION \n \n For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the i nstant Petition without holding an \nevidentiary hearing or issuing a certificate of appealability.  An appropriate Order will be \nentered.
