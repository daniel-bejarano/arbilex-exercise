WILLIAMS \nU.S. DISTRICT nJDGE \nPending before the Court is Defendant Backer EHP Inc. d/b/a/ Backer-Springfield , Inc.'s \n(\"Backer\" or \"Defendant \") motion seeking summary judgment on Plaintiff Zoppas Industries de \nMexico, S.A. de C. V.'s (\"ZIM\" or \"Plaintiff') operative complaint alleging trade secret \nmisappropriation (the \"Motion\"). D.I. 124. For the following reasons, the Motion is granted. \nI. BACKGROUND \nCompetitors ZIM and Backer supply heating elements to companies that incorporate such \nelements into end-user products. Those heating elements are subject to safety standards set forth \nby UL (formerly Underwriters Laboratories ). One such standard, UL 858, was revised by UL \n(\"Revised UL 858\") and required to be implemented by June 15, 2018. ZIM and Backer each \ndiscussed developing new heating elements for third party Whirlpool, Inc. (\"Whirlpool \") that \nwould comply with Revised UL 858. \nWhirlpool and ZIM entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement (\"NDA\") with an \neffective date of November 1, 2016. Among other things, the NDA prohibited Whirlpool from \ndisclosing any of ZIM's confidential information (as defined in the agreement) that ZIM shared \nwith Whirlpool in connection with the design project. Following execution of the NDA, ZIM \nprovided Whirlpool with various design options that would comply with Revised UL 858. \nBacker began discussing its product with Whirlpool after the parties entered into their own \nNDA on June 6, 2017. By the time Backer began discussions with Whirlpool, Backer had already \ndesigned its product and filed a patent application covering its design. Backer's design was \nmaterially complete when it began discussions with Whirlpool and did not materially change \nbefore receiving UL approval. \n1 ZIM and Backer designed different products for Whirlpool. Backer designed a dual-coil \nheating element with a thermostat on the \"leg\" (below the heating coils and away from the cooking \nvessel). ZIM designed a single-coil heating element with a spring-loaded thermostat in the central \n\"medallion\" (pressed against the cooking vessel). During its development process, ZIM had \nconsidered a leg thermostat design similar to Backer's, but rejected it as inferior to the medallion \ndesign. \nOn November 9, 2017, Whirlpool informed ZIM that it had decided not to purchase the \nnew heating elements from ZIM. Whirlpool told ZIM that Whirlpool had instead elected to develop \nRevised UL 858-compliant heating elements with Backer. \nOn November 13, 2017, ZIM requested that Whirlpool return or destroy all copies of \ndocuments that contained ZIM's confidential information. On December 12, 2017, Whirlpool told \nZIM that all documents containing ZIM' s confidential information had been returned or destroyed . \nHowever , ZIM later determined that Whirlpool employees continued to access a file called the \n\"Zoppas Plan.\" The \"Zoppas Plan\" file contained information relating to a medallion design \ncreated by ZIM; it contained no information relating to a leg thermostat design of the type \ndeveloped by Backer. \nOn October 29, 2018, ZIM filed the present suit against Backer asserting claims for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets under the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (\"DTSA\"), \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836, et seq. and the Tennessee Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"TUTSA\") , Tenn. Code \nAnn.\u00a7 47-25-1702 , et seq.1 ZIM's theory as plead is that Backer acquired certain of ZIM's trade \nsecrets from Whirlpool and used those trade secrets to design, engineer, and manufacture Revised \n1 ZIM initially alleged a state law claim for unjust enrichment , D.I. 1, which was later \ndismissed, D.I. 18 & 24. ZIM also sought leave to file an amended complaint , which this Court \ngranted. D.I. 53 & 54. \n2 UL 858 compliant heating elements. See, e.g., D.I. 55 at ,r,r 44, 48, 55. Whirlpool is not involved \nin this action. \nAs this action progressed, ZIM moved to compel Backer to produce certain discovery \nrelated to Backer's relationship with a third-party company named \"Mabe.\" D.I. 94. The Court \ndenied ZIM's motion, finding the Mabe-related evidence not relevant to the allegations in ZIM's \noperative complaint (which plead a misappropriation theory based on Backer's purported \nacquisition of a ZIM trade secret from Whirlpool ). D.I. 98. The Court advised that, \"I[fjf Plaintiff \nwishes to seek leave to amend its operative complaint to include these new allegations , it should \nfile a motion seeking leave to do so.\" Id. ZIM did not seek such leave and did not file a second \namended complaint. \nBacker now moves for summary judgment on ZIM' s misappropriation of trade secrets \nclaims. D.I. 124 & 125 at 2. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. Lamont \nv. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242, 248 (1986)). \"[A] dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is sufficient \nto permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. \"The burden on the \nmoving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of \nevidence supporting the non-moving party's case.\" Peloton Interactive, Inc. v. iFIT Inc., C.A. No. \n20-1535-RGA, 2022 WL 1523112, at *1 (D. Del. May 13, 2022) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317,323 (1986)). \n3 The burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue \nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 \n(1986); Williams v. Borough o/West Chester, 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving \nparty asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to \nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions , documents , electronically stored \ninformation , affidavits or declarations , stipulations ... , admissions , interrogatory answers, or other \nmaterials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish the \nabsence ... of a genuine dispute .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(l). \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences \nin that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the non-moving party \nfails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to which it has \nthe burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex Corp., \n477 U.S. at 322. \nIII. DISCUSSI ON \nBacker argues that ZIM has failed to produce any evidence that Backer acquired any ZIM \ntrade secret from Whirlpool. D.I. 125 at 2. This Court agrees. \nTo establish a misappropriation of trade secrets claim,2 ZIM must prove: \"(1) the existence \nof a trade secret, defined generally as information with independent economic value that the owner \nhas taken reasonable measures to keep secret; (2) that is related to a product or service used in, or \n2 The legal elements of a claim arising under the DTSA and TUTSA are essentially the \nsame. See Great Am. Opportunities , Inc. v. Cherry Bros., LLC, C.A. No. 17-1022, 2018 WL \n418567, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. Jan. 16, 2018) (\"The requirements for establishing misappropriation of \na trade secret are largely the same under the DTSA and the [TUTSA].\"). \n4 intended for use in, interstate or foreign commerce , and (3) the misappropriation of that trade \nsecret(.]\" Oakwood Lab'ys LLC v. Thanoo, 999 F.3d 892, 905 (3d Cir. 2021) (internal citations \nand quotations omitted). \"[M]isappropriation\" is: \"(A) acquisition of a trade secret of another by \na person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; \nor (B) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent\" in certain \ncircumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839(5); Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 47-25-1702(2). \nA. ZIM's Has Waived Its Claim Related to Mabe \nZIM attempts to satisfy the misappropriation element by argumg that that Backer \n\"obtain[ed] a non-public 'sample' of Plaintiffs element from Mabe, which owed Plaintiff a \ncontractual duty of non-disclosure. \" D.I. 133 at 10. But this Court has already ruled Mabe outside \nthe scope of ZIM' s operative complaint , D .I. 98, which pleads a misappropriation theory based on \nBacker's purported acquisition of a ZIM trade secret from Whirlpool, D.I. 55. Indeed, when ZIM \npreviously moved to compel Backer to produce certain discovery related to Mabe, D.I. 94, this \nCourt denied ZIM's motion as follows: \nThe discovery sought by Plaintiff relates to an assertion that Defendant obtained \nnon-public information about Plaintiffs design from a third-party company named \nMabe. The claims in Plaintiff's operative complaint do not have anything to do with \nthat allegation; that complaint alleges that Defendant obtained non-public \ninformation about Plaintiffs design from a different third-party company \n(Whirlpool). So the discovery sought is not relevant to Plaintiffs current claims and \nis thus not warranted. \nD.I. 98 (citations omitted). This Court further advised ZIM that if it \"wishes to seek leave to \namend its operative complaint to include these new allegations [related to Mabe] ... it should file \na motion seeking leave to do so.\" Id. ZIM did not seek leave to amend its complaint to include \n5 allegations related to Mabe.3 As a result, consistent with this Court's earlier ruling, Mabe-related \nevidence is not relevant to the issues at bar. \nNow, ZIM seeks to introduce Mabe-related evidence by arguing that it \"has made no secret \nof its intention to rely on such evidence [related to Mabe.]\" D.I. 133 at 11. But a plaintiff \"may \nnot amend his complaint through arguments in his brief in opposition to a motion for summary \njudgment. \" Bell v. City of Philadelphia , 275 F. App'x 157, 160 (3d Cir. 2008); see also Taylor v. \nSanders, 536 F. App'x 200, 203 (3d Cir. 2013) (\"At the summary judgment stage, the proper \nprocedure for plaintiffs to assert a new claim is to amend the complaint in accordance with Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 15(a).\"). If this Court were to condone ZIM 's attempt to use Mabe-related evidence to \ndefeat summary judgment on a claim based on Backer's relationship with Whirlpool, the Court \nwould err by permitting ZIM to amend its operative complaint via its opposing brief. cf Kyle v. \nApollomax , LLC, 987 F. Supp. 2d 519, 524 (D. Del. 2013) (noting that defendants ' motion for \nsummary judgment \"would have to be granted\" had plaintiff not mentioned a certain third-party \nas support for breach of fiduciary duty theory because \"a party may not utilize its Opposition Brief \nas a vehicle for amending its claims\"). Sanctioning ZIM's conduct here would be especially \nproblematic given that ZIM conceded that amending its complaint was the procedural vehicle by \nwhich to add Mabe-related allegations in this action, D.I. 94 at 2 n.3,4 and Zim was previously \nwarned by the Court to do so, D.I. 98. Thus, ZIM's present excuse for not pleading its Mabe claim \n3 Neither did ZIM seek reconsideration of this Court's decision finding Mabe outside the \nscope of this litigation. \n4 In its letter to the Court seeking to compel Backer to produce evidence related to Mabe, \nZIM acknowledged the propriety of filing an amended complaint to introduce Mabe-related \nallegations into this action: \"Even if the Court were to conclude that the allegations in ZIM's \nAmended Complaint do not entitle ZIM to discovery relating to Mabe, good cause would exist to \nmodify the existing scheduling order and grant ZIM leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to \nadd new allegations concerning Mabe based on the facts learned in discovery .\" D .I. 94 at 2 n.3. \n6 (because it \"was unaware of the evidence at the time that it filed its complaint, \" D.I. 133 at 11) is \nnot persuasive. 5 \nAccordingly , the Court will not credit ZIM's Mabe-related evidence as \"disputed \" material \nfacts precluding the entry of summary judgment. See In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 916 F.2d \n829, 859 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"If a court believes evidence is irrelevant , it need only say so and discount \nit accordingly when it makes its summary judgment determination. \"); Garnett v. Bank of Am., 243 \nF. Supp. 3d 499, 508 n.2 (D. Del. 2017) (declining to rely upon defendant's claim of religious \ndiscrimination as part of employment discrimination action when raised for the first time in \nresponsive summary judgment brief); Thomas v. Colvin, C.A. No. 11-449-RGA , 2016 WL \n4163546, at *2 (D. Del. Aug. 4, 2016) (\"As for Plaintiffs claims that Defendant failed to keep \nrecords, to make an affirmative action plan, and to publish reports, these claims were never in the \ncase at all. Plaintiff could not raise these claims for the first time at summary judgment , and cannot \nraise them now.\"). By failing to amend its complaint , ZIM has waived its claim related to Mabe. \nSpence v. City of Philadelphia , 147 F. App'x 289,292 (3d Cir. 2005). \n5 Curiously , ZIM did not amend even where record evidence contradicts the allegations \nupon which this Court previously relied. For example, ZIM plead that Whirlpool sought an \nextension until September 2018 to comply with Revised UL 858 because Backer was struggling \nto complete its design. D.I. 55 ~~ 38-39. ZIM also plead that Backer's design was a \"near copy\" \nof the confidential ZIM design that it had provided to Whirlpool. Id. at~ 39. And ZIM plead that \nWhirlpool had access to a confidential file during a time when Whirlpool had switched to work \nwith Backer. Id. at 1135-36. This Court credited each of those allegations as lending plausibility \nto ZIM's misappropriation claim. See Report and Recommendation , D.I. 55 at 7-8 (Dec. 22, 2020), \nadopted by, Order, D.I. 54 (Jan. 8, 2021) (emphasis added). But the parties now agree that there \nis no evidence Whirlpool sought an extension , that ZIM and Backer's designs were different, and \nthe Zoppas File did not contain information about the design Backer chose to pursue. D.I. 13411 \n8-12. \n7 B. ZIM Has Provided No Evidence that Backer Acquired a ZIM Trade Secret from \nWhirlpool \nAs a fallback position, ZIM argues that \"even if the direct [Mabe-related] evidence of \nDefendant 's improper acquisition and use of Plaintiffs prototype were irrelevant to Plaintiffs \ncauses of action, the circumstantial evidence is more than sufficient to preclude judgment as a \nmatter oflaw.\" D.I. 133 at 15. \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has explained that \n\"[ c ]ircumstantial evidence can be used to establish a misappropriation of trade secrets, but only \nafter enough specific information has been given to the accused party so they can defend what it \nis they are accused of stealing. Inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence cannot be used to \nsubstantiate bald assertions.\" Givaudan Fragrances Corp. v. Krivda, 639 F. App'x 840, 846 (3d \nCir. 2016). \nHere, ZIM has not identified what specific \" more than sufficient\" circumstantial evidence \nwould create a genuine issue for trial on whether Backer acquired a ZIM trade secret from \nWhirlpool-a burden that is ZIM's to bear. Peloton, 2022 WL 1523112, at *1. In its responsive \nstatement of facts, ZIM argues that \"in the face of such evidence [ related to Mabe], Backer's bare \nassertion that it never acquired trade secrets from Whirlpool should not be credited.\" D.I. 134 ,r \n1. But ZIM does not support the inference it seeks to draw with contradictory facts. See Callaway \nGolf Co. v. Dunlop Slazenger Grp. Americas, Inc., 318 F. Supp. 2d 205, 210 (D. Del. 2004) \n( explaining that \"the party bearing the burden of persuasion in the litigation, must, in opposing a \nsummary judgment motion, 'identify those facts of record which would contradict the facts \nidentified by the movant. '\") ( quoting Port Authority of New York and New Jersey v. Affiliated FM \nIns. Co., 311 F.3d 226, 233 (3d Cir. 2002)). Setting aside unrelated Mabe evidence, ZIM cites \nonly to deposition testimony that Whirlpool told Backer that \"Zoppas' s heating element had a \n8 faster speed ofheat.\" See D.I. 134 ,r,r 1-2.6 Those communications, however, occurred in late 2018 \nafter ZIM's product was already in the public domain-a fact that ZIM does not dispute. D.I. 136, \nEx. Q at 65:24-67:11; D.I. 134 at ,r 6. See NexPay, Inc. v. Comdata Network, Inc., No. 3:14-CV-\n01749, 2018 WL 4185374, at *10 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 30, 2018) (analyzing TUTSA and noting that \n\"[i]t is a fundamental aspect of a trade secret that it actually must be secret\"); Gentil v. Wingfield \nGmbH, No. 20-CV-05358-EMC , 2021 WL 4979427, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2021) (noting under \nthe DTSA that \"[w]hen a trade secret is disclosed to the public, it is no longer protectable\") . \nMoreover , in view of the parties' agreement that Backer designed its product in 2017, \nBacker could not have designed that product based on an awareness of ZIM' s faster speed-of-heat \nobtained in 2018. Indeed, the parties agree that Backer did not begin discussing its product with \nWhirlpool until after Backer received a signed NDA from Whirlpool on June 6, 2017. D.I. 134 ,r \n3. By that time, Backer had already designed its product and filed a patent application covering its \ndesign. Id. at ,r 4. Backer's design was materially complete when it began discussions with \nWhirlpool and did not materially change before receiving UL approval on March 20, 2018. Id. at \n,r,r 5, 15. While ZIM argues that \"Backer never stopped trying to improve its speed-of-heat time,\" \n6 See, e.g., D.I. 134 ,r 1 (citing Sazer Deel. Ex. Q at 67:7-11). \nQ. Okay. So when Sean Howley told you that Zoppas's heating element had a \nfaster speed of heat, what else, if anything, did he tell you about the Zoppas heating \nelement? \nA. Nothing. Nothing else that I recall. I mean, we'd already started benchmarking \nthe Zoppas designs at the end of August and September 2018, so there's probably \nnothing --I didn't learn anything from Whirlpool that I didn't already know. \nTo the extent ZIM cites to Mabe-related evidence to counter Backer's statement of facts, ZIM has \nwaived its ability to rely upon it. See supra. \n9 Id. at ,r,r 4-5, none of ZIM's cited testimony supports an inference that Backer did so by acquiring \na ZIM trade secret from Whirlpool. 7 \nIn essence, ZIM has pointed to Backer's desire to improve its speed-of-heat time and has \nspeculatively concluded that Backer must have acquired a ZIM trade secret to do so. Speculation \ncannot sustain a trade secret misappropriation claim at summary judgment. See Peloton, 2022 WL \n1523112, at * 5 (granting summary judgment on trade secret misappropriation claim when based \non \"speculation\"); LiiON, LLC v. Vertiv Grp. Corp., No. 18-CV-6133 , 2021 WL 4963610, at *7 \n(N.D. Ill. Oct. 26, 2021), appeal dismissed, No. 21-3202, 2022 WL 1656604 (7th Cir. Apr. 27, \n2022) (holding plaintiffs misappropriation theory \"insufficiently concrete and speculative to \novercome summary judgment \" in part because \"it is not enough to point to broad areas of \ntechnology and assert that something there must have been secret and misappropriated. The \nplaintiff must show concrete secrets.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nBecause ZIM lacks sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact on its trade secret \nmisappropriation claims under the DTSA and TUTSA, Backer is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the above reasons, Backer's Motion is granted. The Court will issue an Order \nconsistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n7 In fact, the parties agree that ZIM and Backer came up with different designs (Backer \ndesigned an element with the thermostat on the \"leg\" while ZIM designed an element with the \nthermostat on the \"medallion \"), and that ZIM had previously rejected Backer's thermostat-leg \ndesign as inferior before pursuing its medallion product. Id. at ,r,r 8-11. And the parties agree that \nZIM' s \"Zoppas Plan\" purportedly accessed by Whirlpool contains information solely related to \nZIM' s medallion design; it contains no information relating to a leg thermostat design of the type \ndeveloped by Backer.
