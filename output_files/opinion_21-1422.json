Scripa, MORRISON & FOERSTER LLP, New York, \nNY; \nAttorneys for Defendant. \nFebruary 22, 2022 \n1 Before me is Defendant 's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (D.I. 29). I have \nconsidered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 30, 46, 51). For the following reasons, Defendant's \nmotion is GRANTED . \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Clear Doc, Inc. D/B/ A OpenReel (\"OpenReel \") sued Defendant RiversideFM \n(\"Riverside\") for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,560,500 (\"the '500 patent\"). (D.I. 2). The \npatent is titled \"Systems and Methods for Recording and Storing Media Content\" and discloses \n\"methods and systems of facilitating recording of media content by a mobile device.\" (Id. ,r,r \n14-15). The patent claims a \"control system\" which can remotely trigger a mobile device to \nstart and stop recording. E.g., '500 Patent, cl. 1. In addition to the recording , which is saved \nlocally on the mobile device, the patent claims a communication session between the control \nsystem and the mobile device, which could take the form of a livestream. (D.I. 46 at 3). \nThe '500 patent has twenty-one claims. Claims 1 and 11 are independent method claims. \nEach includes substantially similar steps, though as Riverside notes, \"claim 11 is drafted from \nthe perspective of the mobile device user instead of the 'control system' operator.\"' (D.I. 30 at \n5). Claim 18 is an independent claim that recites a \"control system.\" This system is comprised \nof a camera, a microphone , and a processor configured to perform most of the steps described in \nclaims 1 and 11. \nThe recording process steps include, as illustrated by claim 1 : \n1. A method of facilitating recording of media content by a mobile device, comprising: \nestablishing a communication session between a control system and the mobile device \nover a communication network; \nreceiving , at the control system, video content and audio content from the mobile device \nduring the communication session, wherein the video content is captured by a camera of \n2 the mobile device and the audio content is captured by a microphone of the mobile \ndevice; \ntransmitting a trigger signal, by the control system, to the mobile device, the trigger \nsignal triggering the mobile device to start recording media content using the camera and \nthe microphone of the mobile device during the communication session, wherein the \nmedia content recorded by the mobile device includes a portion of the video content and \nthe audio content, wherein the mobile device includes a data storage device and stores the \nmedia content in the data storage device; \nafter the recording is completed , receiving the media content at the control system; \ndetermining that the media content was successfully received by the control system; and \nresponsive to determining that the media content was successfully received by the control \nsystem, transmitting a first control signal from the control system to the mobile device to \ncause the mobile device to delete the media content from the data storage device. \nThe claims other than 1, 11, and 18 are dependent. Claims 2, 3, 15, 19, and 20 allow the \nmobile device user to view the recorded content and give feedback to the person operating the \ncontrol device. Claims 4 and 16 allow for switching between the mobile device's front-facing \nand rear-facing cameras. Claim 5 turns off the video but retains recorded audio. Claims 6-8, 12, \n13, and 17 adjust or lock the camera's auto-focus or auto-exposure features. Claim 9 determines \nand outputs a degree of tilt based on the phone's gyroscope. Claim 10 shows remaining battery \nlife and whether the phone is likely to run out of battery power before the recording is complete . \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nPatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is a threshold legal issue. Bilski v. Kappas, 561 U.S. \n593,602 (2010). Accordingl y, the\u00a7 101 inquiry is properly raised at the pleading stage if it is \napparent from the face of the patent that the asserted claims are not directed to eligible subject \nmatter. See Cleveland Clinic Found v. True Health Diagnostics LLC, 859 F.3d 1352, 1360 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 2621 (2018). The inquiry is appropriate at this stage \n\"only when there are no factual allegation s that, taken as true, prevent resolving the eligibility \nquestion as a matter of law.\" Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d \n1121, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \n3 Section 101 of the Patent Act provides: \"Whoever invents or discovers any new and \nuseful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful \nimprovement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of \nthis title.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Supreme Court recognizes three categories of ineligible subject \nmatter-laws of nature, natural phenomena , and abstract ideas. Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank \nInt'!, 573 U.S. 208,216 (2014). The purpose of these exceptions is to protect the \"basic tools of \nscientific and technological work.\" Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab ys, Inc., 566 \nU.S. 66, 71 (2012). \nIn Alice, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the framework laid out in Mayo \"for \ndistinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena , and abstract ideas from \nthose that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts.\" 573 U.S. at 217. First, the court \nmust determine whether the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible concept. Id. If the answer is \nyes, the court must look to \"the elements of the claim both individually and as an ordered \ncombination \" to see if there is an \"inventive concept-i.e., an element or combination of \nelements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than \na patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\" Id. at 217-18 ( cleaned up). \"A claim that recites an \nabstract idea must include additional features to ensure that the claim is more than a drafting \neffort designed to monopolize the abstract idea.\" Id. at 221 (cleaned up). Further, \"the \nprohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use \nof [the idea] to a particular technological environment. \" Id. at 222 (alteration in original) \n( quoting Bilski, 561 U.S. at 610-11 ). Thus, \"the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot \ntransform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\" Id. at 223. \nIII. DISCUSSION \n4 A. Alice Step One \nAt Alice step one, I must \"articulate what the claims are directed to with enough \nspecificity to ensure the step one inquiry is meaningful. \" Thales Visionix Inc. v. United States, \n850 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Riverside argues that the claims are directed to \n\"recording , storing, and delivering media content using a mobile device.\" (D.I. 30 at 7). \nOpenReel argues that Riverside ignores key aspects of the claims. (D.I. 46 at 7-8 (highlighting \nthe control system and trigger functionality , the concurrent communication session, and the \nautomatic deletion)). \nI agree that Riverside 's formulation does not fully capture what the claims are \"directed \nto.\" OpenReel 's alternate formulation of what the claims are directed to-\"technical \nimprovements that address technical problems with recording professional quality media content \nusing mobile devices\" -is too vague to be helpful. (D.I. 46 at 1-2); see Enfish, LLC v. \nMicrosoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (warning against formulations that are \n\"untethered from the language of the claims\"). \nThus, I will start from Riverside 's \"recording , storing, and delivering media content using \na mobile device.\" I agree that the \"recording , storing, and delivering \" language is supported by \nthe claims, title, and specification. (D.I. 30 at 8-10). The claims are also directed to remotely \ncontrolling the recording process. The control system, found in every claim, triggers events in \nthe recording process remotely. One problem discussed in the specification-that of proper \nframing-is solved by features supporting remote control. The communication session, for \ninstance, facilitates \"feedback to the mobile device to allow the user to make adjustments that \nimprove the media content.\" '500 Patent at 4:8-10. \n5 Most claims are also directed to automatic deletion. Independent claims 1 and 11, on \nwhich claims 2-10 and 12-17 depend, recite deletion of the locally stored media content after a \nsuccessful upload. The specification highlights a problem solved by automatic deletion: \"limited \nstorage capacity.\" '500 Patent, 3:34-35. Automatic deletion \"allow[s] the mobile device to \nrecord the media content in a high quality, uncompressed format as the mobile device only \ntemporarily stores the media content in local memory.\" Id. 3:64---67. \nThus, most asserted claims are directed to remotely controlling the recording , storing, \ndelivering , and deleting of media content on a mobile device. Some are not directed to deleting. \nThis does not change my analysis in a meaningful way because I find that even the claims \ndirected to deleting are directed to an abstract idea at Alice step one. See Content Extraction & \nTransmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA., 776 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (finding the \ndistrict court did not err in limiting its Section 101 analysis to a single representative claim where \nall claims were \"substantiall y similar and linked to the same abstract idea\"). \n\"In cases involving software innovations, [Alice step one] often turns on whether the \nclaims focus on specific asserted improvements in computer capabilities or instead on a process \nor system that qualifies an abstract idea for which computers are invoked merely as a tool.\" \nUniloc USA, Inc. v. LG Elecs. USA, Inc., 957 F. 3d 1303, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2020). OpenReel \npoints to the following \"specific technological improvements:\" (1) \"establishing a \ncommunication session while also storing media content locally,\" (2) automatic deletion, and (3) \nremotely triggering the recording process. (DI 46 at 11-12.). \nOpenReel argues that these improvements alter the \"normal, expected operation of the \nmobile device.\" (E.g., id. at 9). In support, OpenReel analogizes to SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., \n6 Inc., 930 F.3d 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 1108 (2020) and Enjish. (D.I. 46 at \n10-13). \nIn SRI, the claims were \"directed to using a specific technique-using a plurality of \nnetwork monitors that each analyze specific types of data on the network and integrating reports \nfrom the monitors-to solve a technological problem arising in computer networks: identifying \nhackers or potential intruders into the network.\" 930 F.3d at 1303. The Federal Circuit held that \nthe claims in SRI \"actually prevent the normal, expected operation of a conventional computer \nnetwork.\" Id. at 1304. \nIn Enfish, the asserted patents claimed \"self-referential \" database tables. 822 F.3d at \n1330. These tables used a new logic structure to obviate the need for multiple \"relational \" tables. \nId. at 1330-33. \"In sum, the self-referential table ... is a specific type of data structure designed \nto improve the way a computer stores and retrieves data in memory.\" Id. at 1339. \nOpenReel likens the remote-control aspect of the '500 patent to an \"override\" of the \n\"routine and conventional \" operation of a smartphone. Conventional operation of a smartphone \nrequires the user to manually press record and manually delete stored files. According to \nOpenReel, the '500 patent overrides this functionality by triggering recording and deletion from \nafar. I do not think that a remote trigger \"overrides\" the conventional operation , at least in the \nway that the caselaw uses the term. In DDR Holdings , LLC v. Hotels.com , L.P., for instance, the \npatent addressed the problem of \"retaining website visitors that, if adhering to the routine, \nconventional functioning of Internet hyperlink protocol, would be instantly transported away \nfrom a host's website after 'clicking' on an advertisement and activating a hyperlink.\" 773 F.3d \n1245, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Under the patent's teachings , \"upon the click of an advertisement \nfor a third-party product displayed on a host's website, the visitor is no longer transported to the \n7 third party's website.\" Id. Thus, the claims \"speciflied] how interactions ... are manipulated to \nyield ... a result that overrides the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily \ntriggered by the click of a hyperlink. \" Id. at 1258. \nHere, the control system tells the phone to start recording , and the phone starts recording. \nThe control system tells the phone to delete local content, and the phone deletes local content. \nThis is unlike DDR Holdings where the invention negated the expected result from clicking on a \nhyperlink. \nOpenReel ' s technical improvements are not the sort of improvements contemplated by \nthe Enfish line of cases. Enfish requires a \"specific improvement to the way computers operate.\" \n822 F.3d at 1336. In SRI, the claims recited \"a specific technique. \" 930 F.3d at 1303. In Enfish, \na \"specific type of data structure. \" 822 F.3d at 1339. In contrast, the technology recited in the \n'500 patent is all conventional. The elements that OpenReel claims \"alter\" the normal \nfunctioning of a phone are described generally- \"trigger signal\" and \"control signal\"-and do \nnot disclose a specific improvement to a communication protocol. As Riverside explains, \n[T]he claims do not recite any improved network or communications protocol used to \nconnect the computer and the mobile device; the claims do not recite any improved file, \ndata structure, or other software-based improvement used to record or store media \ncontent or to transmit signals or media content between the computer and the mobile \ndevice; and the claims do not recite any functionality that the computer or mobile device \nwere not already capable of performing. \n(D.I. 51 at 1). \nOpenReel analogizes to Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L. v. LG Elecs., Inc. for the \nargument that the '500 patent provides a specific solution to problems associated with prior art \ntechnologies. (D.I. 46 at 13 (citing 880 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018))). I think Core Wireless is \ndistinguishable. In Core Wireless, the patents disclosed \"improved display interfaces, \nparticularly for electronic devices with small screens.\" 880 F.3d at 1359. The claims were \n8 \"directed to a particular manner of summarizing and presenting information in electronic \ndevices.\" Id. at 1362. The Court highlighted the specificity of the claim limitations-the \nlimitations \"specifi[ ed] a particular manner by which the summary window must be accessed,\" \n\"restrain[ed] the type of data that can be displayed in the summary window ,\" and \"require[d] that \nthe device applications exist in a particular state.\" Id. at 1362-63. As with Enfish, the Core \nWireless patent provided a specific technological solution rather than an idea implemented using \ngeneric components. \nThe '500 patent is more closely analogous to the cases cited by Riverside in support of its \nmotion to dismiss. Under these cases, I think that remotely controlling the recording , storing, \ndelivering, and deleting of media content on a mobile device is an abstract idea. \nCollecting and managing data such as video and audio recording is an abstract idea. In In \nre TL! Commc'ns LLC Pat. Litig., the asserted claims recited \"recording ,\" \"storing,\" \n\"transmitting ,\" and \"receiving\" data. 823 F.3d 607,610 (Fed. Cir. 2016). This is an abstract \nidea. Id. at 613. Delivery of media content is also an abstract idea. In Affinity Labs of Texas, \nLLC v. Amazon.com Inc., the Federal Circuit held ineligible a patent directed to streaming media \ncontent on a mobile device. 838 F.3d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The Court rejected the patentee's \nargument that the patent disclosed a concrete technological improvement because wireless \nstreaming was not \"routine, conventional , or well-known. \" Id. at 1269. The Court held: \nThe patent, however, does not disclose any particular mechanism for wirelessly \nstreaming content to a handheld device. The specification describes the function of \nstreaming content to a wireless device, but not a specific means for performing that \nfunction. Claim 14, in turn, recites (1) a \"media managing system\" that maintains a \nlibrary of content, (2) a \"collection of instructions \" that are \"operable when executed\" by \na handheld wireless device to request streaming delivery of the content, and (3) a \n\"network based delivery resource\" that retrieves and streams the requested content to the \nhandheld device. At that level of generality , the claims do no more than describe a \ndesired function or outcome, without providing any limiting detail that confines the claim \n9 Id. to a particular solution to an identified problem. The purely functional nature of the claim \nconfirms that it is directed to an abstract idea, not to a concrete embodiment of that idea. \nAs in Affinity Labs, the '500 Patent describes a \"control system,\" but \"[t]he specification \nmakes clear that any technology capable\" of accepting user input, processing that input, and \noutputting information back to the user would be covered. Id. at 1271; see '500 Patent at 6:60-\n7:63. Similarly, the \"data storage device\" relies on conventional technolog y and \"may include, \nfor example, a hard disk, any other suitable magnetic medium, CD-ROM , CDRW, DVD, any \nother suitable optical medium, RAM, PROM, EPROM, FLASH-EPROM , any other suitable \nmemory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other suitable medium from which a computer \ncan read.\" '500 Patent at 6:3-23. See In re TL!, 823 F.3d at 612 (\"The specification does not \ndescribe a new telephone, a new server, or a new physical combination of the two. The \nspecification fails to provide any technical details for the tangible components, but instead \npredominatel y describes the system and methods in purely functional terms.\"). \nI think \"remote control\" is an abstract idea when, as here, the patent does not claim some \nnew way of establishing the connection or improving the process. In the unreported case \nSensormatic Elecs., LLC v. Wyze Labs, Inc., the Federal Circuit held ineligible patents \"which \ngenerally describe a wireless surveillance system and methods of operation. \" 2021 WL \n2944838, at * 1 (Fed. Cir. July 14, 2021 ). The claims included \"interaction with a remote server\" \nand \"direct wireless communication with a remote viewing device operable by an authorized \nuser.\" U.S. Pat. No. 7,954,129 cl. 14. The Federal Circuit agreed that the patents were \"directed \nto the abstract ideas of wireless communication and remote surveillance. \" Id. at *3 (quoting \nSensormatic Elecs., LLC v. Wyze Labs, Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 161, 165 (D. Del. 2020)). \nIn sum, the recording , storing, delivering, and deleting of media content on a mobile \ndevice is an abstract idea. Remote control is an abstract idea. The piling of abstract ideas upon \n10 each other does not save the '500 patent at Alice step one. See, e.g., id. (\"(P]rioritization of ICD \ninput data through detection of trigger events is an aspect of the abstract idea of remote \nsurveillance as well as drawn to the abstract idea of classifying and organizing images. \nAccordingl y, we conclude that the claims are directed to an abstract idea at Alice step one.\"). \nThe dependent claims similarly do not recite any specific technological improvements. \nThus, all claims of the '500 Patent are directed to the abstract idea ofremotely controlling the \nrecording , storing, and delivering of media content on a mobile device. Most claims are \nadditionally directed to the abstract idea of automatic deletion, but as discussed above, this does \nnot recite a specific technological improvement. \nB. Alice Step Two \nAt step two, although the \"question of whether a claim element oi-combination of \nelements is well-understood , routine and conventional to a skilled artisan in the relevant field is a \nquestion of fact,\" \"not every \u00a7 101 determination contains genuine disputes over the underlying \nfacts material to the\u00a7 101 inquiry.\" Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. \n2018). Riverside argues that there is no genuine factual dispute. (D.I. 30 at 17). Based on the \npresent record, I agree. \nIndividuall y, the elements do not recite an inventive concept. As discussed above, the \nspecification shows that elements such as the \"control system\" and the \"data storage device\" \nmerely rely on conventional technology. \nAs an ordered combination, the claims do not recite an inventive concept that is \n\"significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\" Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS \nBank Int'!, 573 U.S. 208,218 (cleaned up). The '500 patent aims to allow for the production of \n\"polished, professional quality media content\" without the need for onsite video production \n11 agencies. '500 Patent at 3:64--4:2. According to OpenReel, to achieve this goal, the '500 patent \ndiscloses several inventive concepts. (D.I. 46 at 16-20). These inventive concepts overcome \n\"industry challenges \" such as \"proper framing [ of] a video when unassisted \" and \"limited \nstorage capacity of some mobile devices.\" (D.I. 2 , 15). The '500 patent addresses framing \nchallenges through the communication session, which allows for the director to give the user \nfeedback on positioning , and the remote-control feature, which \"allows the user to avoid \nundesired movement at the beginning of the recording. \" (D.I. 46 at 4). The '500 patent's \nautomatic delete function addresses the limited storage capacity issue. (Id. at 1 7). OpenReel \nalso has an expert, who explains, \"The '500 Patent represents a novel development for recording \nremote media content in mobile devices by addressing several industry challenges \" and \nrepresents an \"innovation in the field ofremote video recording. \" (D.1. 2-1, Ex B ,, 23-24). \nI do not think the claims are directed to an inventive concept involving higher-quality \nmedia content, at least in the technical sense of higher video or audio quality. As Riverside \nnotes, \"none of the limitations recite or require that the streamed or locally-recorded content to \nbe of any particular quality, let alone that the locally-recorded content be of a higher quality.\" \n(D.I. 51 at 9). \nRegarding the other inventive concepts , the technological claim limitations such as \n\"trigger signal\" are described in abstract, generic ways. See Sensormatic, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 169 \n(\"[T]he 'automatic detection of trigger events' claim limitation ... is a feature of the abstract \nidea of remote surveillance and the mere automation and distribution of event detection using \ngeneric components does not provide an inventive step. The patent does not explain how the \nautomatic detection at multiple locations is achieved beyond the use of generic components.\" \n(citations omitted)) . OpenReel 's expert provided conclusory statements regarding the novelty of \n12 the '500 patent but has not provided any support that the claim limitations include \nnonconventional steps or technologies. (See D.I. 2 Ex. B ,r,r 23-24). \nClaims fail Alice step two when they are directed to \"an abstract idea implemented on \ngeneric computer components , without providing a specific technical solution beyond simply \nusing generic computer concepts in a conventional way.\" Bascom Glob. Internet Servs., Inc. v. \nAT&T Mobility LLC, 827 F.3d 1341, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Ultimately, the claims here do not \nrecite anything other than the use of conventional technology to perform the abstract idea of \nremotely controlling the recording , storage, delivery, and deletion of media content. The \nadditional limitations recited in the dependent claims also include generic mobile device or \ncomputer components and conventional steps. Thus, the '500 patent does not supply an \ninventive concept at Alice step two. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nRiverside 's motion to dismiss is granted. Dismissal is without prejudice. OpenReel has \nrequested leave to amend. (D.I. 46 at 19 n.1 ). I will grant that request, as it is possible OpenReel \ncould successfully amend its complaint. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n13 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nClearDoc , Inc.
