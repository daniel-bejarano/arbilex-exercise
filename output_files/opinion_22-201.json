No. 22-201 (MN)  \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n \n At Wilmington this 30th  day of March  2023: \n As announced at the hearing on March 20, 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that : \n 1. Eos Positioning Systems , Inc.\u2019s (\u201c Plaintiff \u201d) Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State \na Claim (D.I. 19) is DENIED . \n Plaintiff  moved to dismiss the complaint  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, alleging that the claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,834,806 (\u201cthe \u2019806 patent\u201d) , \n8,8081,112 (\u201cthe \u2019112 patent\u201d) , and 7,978,129 (\u201cthe \u2019129 patent\u201d)  are invalid as claiming ineligible \nsubject matter under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  Plaintiff\u2019s  motion w as fully briefed as of July 1, 2022,1 and \nthe Court received further submissions regarding supplemental authority from Plaintiff .  (See \nD.I. 33).  The Court received further submissions regarding which Supreme  Court or Federal \nCircuit case each party contends is analogous to the claims at issue in Plaintiff\u2019s  motion as related \nto the \u00a7 101 arguments. ( See D.I. 55, 56).   The Court carefully reviewed all submissions in \nconnection with Plaintiff\u2019s  motions, heard oral argument  (D.I. 63), and applied the following legal \nstandard in reaching its decision. \n \n1  ( See D.I. 20, 25, 30).  2 I. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim \nIn ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept all well-\npleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff.  See Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 229 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 232-33 (3d Cir. 2008).  \u201c [A] court need not \u2018accept as true allegations \nthat contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit,\u2019 such as the claims and the patent specification.\u201d  Secured Mail Sols. LLC v. Universal Wilde, Inc. , 873 F.3d 905, 913 \n(Fed.  Cir. 2017) (quoting Anderson v. Kimberly -Clark Corp., 570 F. App\u2019x 927, 931 (Fed. Cir. \n2014)) .  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is only appropriate if a complaint does not contain \n\u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)); see also Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009).  \u201c[P]atent \neligibility can be determined at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage . . . when there are no factual allegations that, taken as true, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.\u201d  Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nB. Patent -Eligible Subject Matter  \nSection 101 of the Patent Act provides that anyone who \u201cinvents or discovers any new and \nuseful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or  any new and useful \nimprovement thereof\u201d may obtain a patent.  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  The Supreme Court has recognized three exceptions to the broad categories of subject matter eligible for patenting under \u00a7 101:  laws of nature, physical phenomena , and abstract ideas .  Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , 573 U.S. \n208, 216 (2014).  These exceptions \u201care \u2018the basic tools of scientific and technological work\u2019 that 3 lie beyond the domain of patent protection.\u201d  Ass\u2019n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, \nInc., 569 U.S. 576, 589 (2013) (quoting Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc. , \n566 U.S. 66, 77-78 (2012)) ; see also  Alice , 573 U.S. at 216.  A claim to any one of these exceptions \nis directed to ineligible subject matter under \u00a7 101.  \u201c[W]hether a claim recites patent eligible \nsubject matter is a question of law which may contain underlying facts.\u201d  Berkheimer v. HP Inc. , \n881 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nCourts follow a two- step \u201cframework for distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, \nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim patent -eligible applications of those \nconcepts.\u201d  Alice , 573 U.S. at 217; see also Mayo , 566 U.S. at 77-78.  First, at step one, the Court \ndetermines whether the claims are directed to one of the three patent -ineligible concepts.  Alice , \n573 U.S. at 217 .  If the claims are not directed to a patent -ineligible concept, \u201cthe claims satisfy \n\u00a7 101 and [the Court] need not proceed to the second step.\u201d  Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L. v. LG Elecs., Inc. , 880 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  If, however, the Court finds that the claims \nat issue are directed to a patent -ineligible concept, the Court must then, at step two, search for an \n\u201cinventive concept\u201d \u2013 i.e., \u201can element or combination of elements that is \u2018sufficient to ensure that \nthe patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.\u2019\u201d  Alice , 573 U.S. at 217-18 (alteration in origina l) (quoting Mayo , 566 U.S. at 72-73). \n1. Step One of the Alice  Framework  \nAt step one of Alice , \u201cthe claims are considered in their entirety to ascertain whether their \ncharacter as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter.\u201d  Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc. , 790 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2015); see also  Affinity Labs of Texas, LLC v. \nDIRECTV, LLC , 838 F.3d 1253, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (step one looks at the \u201cfocus of the claimed \nadvance over the prior art\u201d to determine if the claim\u2019s \u201ccha racter as a whole\u201d is to ineligible subject 4 matter).  In addressing step one of Alice , the Court should be careful not to oversimplify the claims \nor the claimed invention because, at some level, all inventions are based upon or touch on abstract \nideas, nat ural phenomena , or laws of nature.  Alice , 573 U.S. at 217; see also McRO, Inc. v. Bandai \nNamco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  \u201cAt step one, therefore, it is not enough to merely identify a patent -ineligible concept underlying the c laim; [courts] must \ndetermine whether that patent -ineligible concept is what the claim is \u2018directed to.\u2019\u201d  Rapid Litig. \nMgmt. Ltd. v. CellzDirect, Inc., 827 F.3d 1042, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \n2. Step Two of the Alice  Framework  \nAt step two of Alice , in searchi ng for an inventive concept, the Court looks at the claim \nelements and their combination to determine if they transform the ineligible concept into something \u201csignificantly more.\u201d  Alice , 573 U.S. at 218; see also McRO , 837 F.3d at 1312.  This \nsecond step is satisfied when the claim elements \u201cinvolve more than performance of \u2018well -\nunderstood, routine, [and] conventional activities previously known to the industry.\u2019\u201d  Berkheimer , \n881 F.3d at 1367 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Mayo, 566 U.S. at 73.  \u201cThe inventive concept inquiry requires more than recognizing that each claim element, by itself, was known in the art. . . . [A]n inventive concept can be found in the non- conventional and non-\ngeneric arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\u201d  Bascom Glob. Internet Servs., Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  Whether claim elements or their combination \nare well -understood, routine , or conventional to a person of ordinary skill in the art is a question \nof fact.  Berkheimer , 881 F.3d at 1368. \nAt both steps of the Alice  framework, courts often find it useful \u201cto compare the claims at \nissue with claims that have been considered in the now considerably large body of decisions applying \u00a7 101.\u201d  TMI Sols. LLC v. Bath & Body Works Direct, Inc. , No. 17-965- LPS-CJB, 2018 5 WL 4660370, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. 28, 2018) (citing Amdocs (Israel) Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc., \n841 F.3d 1288, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2016)); see also  Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, \n1334 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \nII. THE COURT\u2019S RULING  \nThe ruling on Plaintiff\u2019s  motion to dismiss2 under Rule 12(b)(6) was announced from the \nbench at the conclusion of the hearing as follows: \nThank you for the arguments today.  I am prepared to rule \non the pending motion.  I will not be issuing a written opinion, but I \nwill issue an order stating my ru ling.  I want to emphasize that \nalthough I am not issuing a written opinion, we have followed a full \nand thorough process before making the decisions I am about to state.  There was briefing on the pending motion, there were \nadditional submissions discussing what each party viewed as the \nmost analogous case and there has been oral argument here today. All of the submissions and the arguments have been considered. \nAs to the law, I am not going to read into the record my \nunderstanding of Section 101 law or the applicable pleading standards.  I have a legal standard section that I have included in \nearlier orders, including in Northwestern University v. Universal Robots A/S et al. , No. 21- 149. I incorporate that law and adopt it into \nmy ruling today and I will also set it out in the order that I issue. \nNow as to my rulings.  There are three patents\n[3] [U.S. Patent \nNos. 7,834,806, 8,8081,112, and 7,978,129]  asserted in the \ncomplaint and amended counterclaims.  Two of the patents, the \u2019806 \npatent and the \u2019112 patent share a specification.  All of the patents relate to managing utility assets through precise utility location.  \nPlaintiff has moved to dismiss Defendant\u2019s amended \ncounterclaims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that the asserted claims are directed to an abstract idea and lack inventive concepts sufficient to render them patent eligible under \u00a7 101. \n \n2  (D.I. 19).  \n3  Plaintiff originally sought declaratory judgment of invalidity and non- infringement of five \npatents and Defendant counterclaimed alleging infringement and validity on all patent s.  \nThe parties have since dismissed two  patents from this case .  (D.I. 29).  6 First, I want to address representativeness of the claims \ndiscusse d.  In the briefing, Plaintiff treats claim 11 of the \u2019806 patent \nand claim 7 of the \u2019112 patent as representative.[4]  In its brief, \nDefendant does not challenge the representativeness of these \nclaims[5] and Defendant confirmed today that it is not challenging \nthat representativeness for the \u2019806 patent and the \u2019112 patent.[6]  \nGiven that agreement and because I find that the claims are substantially similar and nothing I\u2019ve seen or heard suggests those claims are not representative, I will accept that those claims are \nrepresentative of the other claims of those respective patents.  \n[Claim 11 of the \u2019806 patent recites:  \n11. A system for collecting utility location information comprising:  \nGPS receiver for identifying a current location;  \na processor configured to process input data for \ndefining a project including a  project area, \nproject criteria, rules applied to the project and data accessibility  rights, retrieve a GIS \nlandbase template including map imagery and \ninfrastructure  from a database, and integrate an \nimagery of the project area with the current  \nlocation to generate an image representation of the project area in real time;  \na display for displaying the image representation \nof the project area comprisin g the  current \nlocation as a moving map;  \na location determining device for obtaining the \nlocation of an identified utility asset in \naccordance with the displayed representation \nof the project area, wherein the  processor is \nfurther configured to integrate the obtained location with the GIS  landbase  template \nincluding the map imagery and the \n \n4  (D.I. 20 at 13- 14, 15).  \n5  (D.I. 25 at 7).  \n6  See, e .g., Berkheimer v. HP Inc. , 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (\u201cCourts may treat \na claim as representative in certain situations, such as if the patentee does not present any  \nmeaningful argument for the distinctive significance of any claim limitations not found in \nthe representative claim or if the parties agree to treat a claim as representative.\u201d).  7 infrastructure to create a precision grid \nincluding the location of the utility asset the \nmap imagery and the  infrastructure;  \na first database for storing the precision grid; and  \na database management module for managing \nusage and distribution of the stored precision \ngrid utilizing the defined project criteria, rules applied to the project and data accessibility \nrights. \n Claim 7 of the \u2019112 patent recites:  \n7. A system for collecting information related to utility assets comprising:  \nan underground imaging device for determining \na position of an underground utility asset;  \na GPS receiver for generating location data for \nthe underground utility asset;  \na processor configured to integrate the location \ndata with the determined position of the \nunderground utility asset in substantially real time to provide information  about depth, \nlongitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of the \nposition of the  underground ut ility asset, and \nadd characteristics of the underground utility asset  including a size of the underground utility \nasset, to the integrated data to generate one or \nmore data records for the underground utility asset;  \na database for storing landbase data, wherein the \nprocessor is further configured to integrate the \nlandbase data with the one or more data records for the underground  utility asset in \nsubstantially real time; and  \na display for displaying a scrolling map including \nthe one or more data rec ords and a portion of \nthe landbase data. ] \n \nAs to the \u2019129 patent, in the briefing Plaintiff treats claim 12 \nas representative.\n[7] Defendant expressly challenged \n \n7  (D.I. 20 at 12).  8 representativeness because claim 12 lacks certain limitations found \nin other asserted claims.[8]  In its brief, Defendant does not treat any \nclaims as representative, but does imply that claim 8 of the \u2019129 patent could be representative.\n[9]  In its reply brief, Plaintiff stated \nthat it would accept claim 8 as representative.[10]  Today, Defendant \nagreed that claim 8 of the \u2019129 patent is representative.[11]  I will \naccept it as being representative.   \n[Claim 8 , which is dependent on claim 4 of the \u2019129 patent \nrecites:  \n8. The method of claim 4, further comprising creating a  \nmovable map from the precision integrated grid and displaying the movable map in real time for showing the location of  the user in relation to a utility.  \nClaim 4, which is dependent on claim 1 of the \u2019129 patent \nrecites:  \n4. The method of claim 1, further comprising generation a  \nprecision integrated grid from the GIS data transaction. \nClaim 1 of the \u2019129 patent recites:  \n1. A method for generating a GIS data transaction including \ninformation about a topography of a region and utilities  \nwithin the region, the method comprising:  \nproviding information about the topography of \nthe region;  \nreceiving information about a user collecting \ndata related  to one or more utilities in the \nregion;  \nreceiving information about time and date of the \ncollected  data;  \nreceiving infor mation about each of the utilities; \n \n8  (D.I. 25 at 7)  (\u201cYet Eos\u2019s \u2018representative\u2019 claim for the \u2019129 Patent, claim 12, is missing \nthe \u2018real time\u2019 limitation found in claim 15 and the \u2018GIS data transactions\u2019 found in claim \n17\u201d).  \n9  (See D.I. 25 at 13).  \n10  (D.I. 30 at 3).  \n11  (D.I. 63 at 27:6- 8). 9 receiving information about location of each of \nthe utilities;  \nreceiving information about the manner of \ncollecting data;  \nreceiving information about revisions made to \nthe information about the topography; and  \nintegratin g the received information with the \ninformation  about the topography of the region \ninto a GIS data transaction. ] \nLet\u2019s go to step 1 of Alice .  Plaintiff contends that the patents \nare directed to \u201cthe abstract idea of utility locating implemented on \nconvent ional devices.\u201d[12]  Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the \u2019129 \npatent is \u201cdirected to the abstract idea of receiving, storing, and \ndisplaying data applied to the field of utility locate operations,\u201d[13] \nand the \u2019806 and \u2019112 patents are \u201cdirected to the abstract idea of \nstoring and displaying data applied to the field of utility locate \noperations.\u201d[14]  Plaintiff characterizes the patents as using generic \ndevices as tools to collect, analyze, and display da ta for more precise \nutility location.  As Plaintiff points out, humans have been \nperforming utility locate operations for over a century.[15]  Thus, to \nPlaintiff, the asserted Patents only automate \u201cthe longstanding business practice of utility locate operations.\u201d\n[16] \nPlaintiff identified Move, Inc. v. Real Estate Alliance Ltd.,  \n721 F. App\u2019x 950 (Fed. Cir. 2018)  as its most analogous case.[17]  In \nMove, the patents claimed methods of modifying the location and \nview of a displayed map with a conventional computer based on human input.  The Federal Circuit found the patents were directed \nto the \u201cabstract idea of \u2018collecting and organizing information about \navailable real estate properties and displaying this information on a digital map that can be manipulated by the user.\u2019\u201d\n[18]  The patents \nclaimed a method of storing property locations in a geographical \n \n12  (D.I. 20 at 2 ). \n13  (Id. at 12) . \n14  (Id. at 13- 14, 15) . \n15  (Id. at 9 ). \n16  (Id. at 8 ). \n17  (D.I. 56).  \n18  Move, 721 F. App\u2019x at 953- 54. 10 region, displaying a zoomed in area of the geographical area in \ndigital map form, generating a plurality of points from the stored property locations, and using those points to identify and locate the properties in the region.  According to Plaintiff, the claims here similarly recite a method collecting an d organizing information \nabout a geographical location and display them on a map, and any \ntechnological improvements touted by Defendant are not explained \nin the patents, but rather only recite a result. \nPlaintiff also relies on CertusView Techs., LLC v. S  & N \nLocating Servs., LLC , 111 F. Supp. 3d 688, aff \u2019d, 695 F. App\u2019 x 574 \nheavily in its briefing and here today to argue that the claims are directed to an abstract idea.  In Plaintiff\u2019s view, the claims here are \nindistinguishable from that case.  In CertusVi ew, the claims were \ndirected to systems and methods for utility locate operations, where the claims recited electronically receiving an image of the dig area and displaying the image, adding to the image a physical location mark of a utility, and electroni cally transmitting or storing the \ninformation in a computer readable device.  At step 1, the court \nfound the claims to be directed to the abstract ideas of \u201ccreating a computer readable file to store information,\u201d \u201celectronically transmitting or storing inf ormation,\u201d and \u201celectronically displaying \ninformation\u201d \u201cas applied in the particular technological environment of conducting a locate operation.\u201d\n[19]  According to the court, the \nclaim elements \u201cembrace[d] the abstract process of taking input information, in the form of an image; displaying it; adding additional information to it \u2014the representation of the physical \nlocate marks; and storing such informat ion in a computer readable \nfile.\u201d\n[20]  In Plaintiff\u2019s view, the claims here are no different as the \nclaims in CertusView mirror the same type of data recited in the \nclaims here, such \u201ca map of a geographical region,\u201d \u201ca user collecting data,\u201d \u201cdata related to  each of the utilities,\u201d \u201clocation of \neach of the utilities,\u201d and \u201crevisions made to the information,\u201d drafted largely in functional terms and using only generic computer technology.\n[21]  \nDefendant argues that the inventions claimed in the patents \nare an imp rovement to the technology used in utility locate \noperations and that the claims, as a whole, are directed to an improved technique and improved capabilities \u2013 i.e. the claims \nprovide \u201ca new \u2018way\u2019 to locate utilities, by combining precise \n \n19  CertusView , 111 F. Supp. 3d at 708, 718, 722, 724 and 728. \n20  (Id. at 709).  \n21  (\u2019129 Pat. 10:50- 61). 11 database entry wi th the generation of a precise moveable map in \nreal-time\u2014a specific combination resulting in not only a novel \nsystem, but one with improved capability over any individual \ncomponent parts.\u201d[22] In particular, Defendant argues that the \nclaimed inventions are \u201c directed to an improved method of \ncapturing, integrating and displaying utility data via a \u2018precision integrated grid\u2019 and \u2018moveable map\u2019 in \u2018real time.\u2019\u201d\n[23] Plaintiff \nanalogizes the claims to the patents in TakaDu Ltd. v. Innovyze, Inc.,  \nC.A. No. 21- 291-RGA, 2022 WL  684409 (D. Del. Mar. 8, 2022) ,[24] \nwhere Judge Andrews found the claims were \u201cdirected to methods and systems for analyzing and using geographical information system (GIS) data, asset management data, and sen[s]or archive data \nof one or more asset s to improve resource network operation and \nmonitoring,\u201d and \u201canalyze[d] GIS data to gain insight into the \nperformance of a utility network,\u201d which was not an abstract idea.\n[25]  \nFocusing first on claim 8 of the \u2019129 patent, unlike TakaDu, \nclaim 8 viewed as a whole is not directed to an improvement in the \nfunctioning of technology \u2013 rather, the focus of the claim is on using \ngeneric technology to implement the abstract idea of receiving, storing, and displaying data as applied to the particular technological \nfield of utility locate operations.  That is, claim 8 does not seem \nanalogous to TakaDu because there, the claims recited a detailed \nstatistical method for predicting what the data should look like, and identifying leaks based on those predictions and the c ourt found the \nstatistical analysis and manipulation of the GIS data to be a \ntechnological improvement.  Here, however, the patents do not \nclaim any statistical analysis or manipulation of data.  Instead, the \npatents claim human behaviors of gathering locati on data, marking \nthe location on a map, and then displaying the map, rather than improvements in the technical operation of utility location.  \nI agree with Plaintiff that claim 8 of the \u2019129 patent is much \nmore akin to the claims at issue in Move and CertusView , at least for \nmy analysis in step one.  The claims at issue in those cases were \naimed at using technology to make human behavior easier or more efficient \u2013 collecting, organizing, and displaying information about \navailable real estate properties in Move  and electronically \ntransmitting, storing or displaying information in utility locate \n \n22  (D.I. 25 at 9) . \n23  (Id.). \n24  (D.I. 25 at 10).  \n25  TakaDu, 2022 WL 684409 at *4. 12 operations in CertusView .  Moreover, those claims were broad and \ndrafted in largely functional terms, suggesting that the focus of the \nclaims at issue was largely o n a result rather than how to achieve \nthat result \u2013 an indicator that a claim is directed to an abstract idea. \nHere, claim 8 of the \u2019129 patent is drafted broadly and focused on \nthe result of storing collected data about a utility and generating a \nprecisio n integration grid with the stored information, and \ndisplaying it on a map.  The purported \u201cnew way\u201d to locate utilities \nis not readily apparent from the claim language, and the claim is \nmore focused on automating location data as opposed to having a human draw it by hand.  In sum, I find that claim 8 is directed to the \nabstract idea of receiving, storing, and displaying data applied to the field of utility locate operations.  \nTurning to step two of the analysis, Plaintiff argues that the \nclaims of the \u2019129 pa tent use only generic devices in known ways to \nperform utility locate operations.  Plaintiff emphasizes that the \u2019129 \npatent discloses a generic computer and already existing technology that is used to collect, store, and display data in utility operations,  \nand there is no description of how the improved functionality is achieved.  \nDefendant asserts that the \u2019129 patent claims recite an \nunconventional arrangement of components sufficient to confer an inventive concept to the otherwise abstract idea of receivi ng, \nstoring, and displaying data applied to the field of utility locate \noperations.  In particular, Defendant emphasizes that the real time \nrequirement, precision integration grid, and movable or scrollable map as something other than routine, well -known, or \nconventional.\n[26]  According to Defendant, these elements provide a \nunique combination that overcome deficiencies in the prior art.  \nDefendant points to BASCOM[27] as an analogous case, \nwhere at step two, the Federal Circuit found the challenged claims contai ned an inventive concept.\n[28]  BASCOM  involved claims \nrelated to filtering content on the internet, which the Federal Circuit found was an abstract idea.  At step two, however, the Federal \nCircuit found the inventive concept in the \u201cnon -conventional and \nnon-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces\u201d that \nimproved over the prior art and did not preempt all ways of \n \n26  (D.I. 25 at 14- 17). \n27  BASCOM Global Internet Services, Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. \n2016). \n28  (D.I. 55).  13 filtering.[29]  Defendant asserts the claims here are similar, as the \nasserted claims have a unique combination of elements that \novercome the pr ior art.  \nI agree with Defendant that this case is analogous to \nBASCOM at least as pleaded.  In its counterclaims, Defendant \nincludes a number of allegations that plausibly suggest the real time \nand precision integration functionality into the moving or scrolling \nmaps was accomplished in an unconventional way.[30]  Nothing in \nthe \u2019129 patent contradicts these allegations.  Under Berkheimer , \nwhether the claim elements and their ordered combination is simply well known, routine and conventional is a question of fact and, in this case, because there are plausible factual allegations as to the unconventionality of the real time, precision integration and scrolling or movable maps elements, there is a factual dispute that precludes dismissal.\n[31] \nI do not agree that Defendant\u2019s pleading must point to \nportions of the specification that support its contention that certain limitations are not well understood, routine or conventional.  At the motion to dismiss stage, Aatrix  requires me to resolve plausi bly \nalleged factual issues in favor of the patentee at step two.  This \nmeans that if Defendant includes in its counterclaim plausible factual allegations that support the conclusion that the claim elements or their ordered combination were not well -understood, \nroutine or conventional and there is nothing in the record that I can properly consider on a motion to dismiss that contradicts those allegations, then those factual issues must be decided in favor of Defendant.\n[32]  \n \n29  BASCOM , 827 F.3d at 1350. \n30  (See D.I. 17 at \u00b6\u00b6 35 -39). \n31  Berkheimer , 881 F.3d at 1368. \n32  Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1127- 28 (Fed. Cir. \n2018) (\u201cViewed in favor of Aatrix, as the district court must at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the \ncomplaint alleges that the claimed combination improves the functioning and operation of \nthe computer itself.  These allegations, if accepted as true, contradict the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that the claimed combination was conventional or routine.  There fore, it was an \nabuse of discretion for the district court to deny leave to amend. . . .  Whether the claim \nelements or the claimed combination are well- understood, routine, conventional is a \nquestion of fact.  And in this case, that question cannot be answe red adversely to the \npatentee based on the sources properly considered on a motion to dismiss, such as the \ncomplaint, the patent, and materials subject to judicial notice.\u201d).  14 \nThus, at step two, I cannot conclude  that the claim elements \nor their ordered combination are well known, routine and \nconventional activities known in the art, thereby failing to confer an inventive concept.  Given the constraints of Berkheimer\n[33] and \nAatrix[34], I cannot resolve this question today in light of \nDefendant\u2019s plausible factual allegations in the counterclaims that are uncontradicted by the \u2019129 Patent or anything else I can properly consider at this stage.\n[35]  Plaintiff\u2019s motion with respect to the \u2019129 \npatent is denied with leave to renew at summary judgment to the extent there are no factual issues precluding resolution of the \u00a7 101 issues at that time.  \nTurning now to the \u2019112 and \u2019806 patents, I reach the same \nconclusions for the reasons I just explained for the \u2019129 patent.  I do so because the parties largely analyze the three patents together and \nsimilarly under \u00a7 101.  In its opening brief, Plaintiff analyzes the \nthree patents separately, but states the claims for the \u2019112 and \u2019806 patents are similar and its argument for the \u2019129  patent is also \nsimilar.\n[36]  Defendant lumps all the patents together in its answer.[37] \nNeither party asserts that there is any meaningful difference among the patents.   Plaintiff\u2019s motion with respect to the \u2019112 and \u2019806 \npatents is therefore also denied with leave to renew at summary judgment to the extent there are no factual issues precluding resolution of the \u00a7 101 issues at that time.  \n(D.I.  63). \n \n            \n     The Honorable Maryellen Noreika      United States District Judge  \n \n33  Berkheimer , 881 F.3d at 1368. \n34  Aatrix , 882 F.3d at 1127-28. \n35  For portions of its argument, Plaintiff relies on statements made by inventor Page Tucker \nduring an interview and asks the Court to take judicial notice of the interview because it is a public interview and an admission by a party opponent. (D.I. 20 at 8). Plaintiff does not cite to any cases where a court took judicial notice of an interview on a motion to \ndismiss for patent ineligibility. Moreover, Plaintiff attempts to use these statements for \nthe truth of the matter asserted, indicating more discovery would be beneficial in this case, and a finding of patent ineligibility under \u00a7 101 at this stage would be premature. \n36  (D.I. 20 at 12-15, 17-20). \n37  (D.I. 25 at 8- 17).
