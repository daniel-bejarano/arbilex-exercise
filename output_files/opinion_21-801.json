HANTZ, f/k/a NICOLE \nOLDHAM , \nPlaintiff; \nV. \nDIVISION OF STATE POLICE, \nDEPARTMENT OF SAFETY & HOMELAND \nSECURITY , STATE OF DELAWARE , \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 21-801-RGA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nJohn M. LaRosa, LaROSA & ASSOCIATES LLC, Wilmington , DE; \nAttorney for Plaintiff. \nKenneth L. Wan, STATE OF DELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE , Wilmington , DE; \nAttorney for Defendant. \nMay 13, 2022 \n1 Before me is Defendant 's motion to dismiss. (D.I. 7). I have considered the parties' \nbriefing. (D.I. 8, 9, 10). For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is DENIED. \nI. BACKGR OUND \nPlaintiff Nicole Hantz worked for Defendant Delaware State Police (\"DSP\") from 2002 \nto 2018. (D.I. 5 ,r,r 12, 184). In the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), Hantz alleges incidents \nof bullying, disparate treatment , denial of benefits, and sexual advances and harassment. I focus \nhere on some relevant allegations , all of which accept as true for purposes of this decision, \nleading up to Hantz' s transfer and termination. \"When Plaintiff was selected for the [Executive \nProtection Unit \"EPU\"], male troopers placed a photo and a message in her mailbox falsely \nclaiming that Plaintiff performed oral sex on Delaware 's Speaker of the House to gain the \nprestigious EPU job.\" (Id. ,r 83). During her service in the EPU, Hantz attended a governors ' \nconvention in the Midwest with Corporal Rossi. \"While driving to the convention in the \nMidwest, Rossi pretended to brake hard, pretended to merely hold Plaintiff back in the seat, \nreached his arm across the front seat of the car, and put his open hand on Plaintiff's breast \nnumerous times.\" (Id. ,r 93). At the convention , Rossi got a key to Hantz's hotel room from the \nfront desk, let himself in, and \"declared that he was going to stay in Plaintiff's room with her for \nthe night.\" (Id. ,r 101). Uncomfortable with the situation, Hantz locked herself in the bathroom \nand called for help. (Id. ,r,r 103-105) . \nHantz requested a transfer out of the EPU in 2016 and was transferred to Troop 4. (Id. \n,r,r119-21). During her time on Troop 4, \"on a nearly daily basis, Lieutenant John McColgan , a \nmale, harassed and belittled Plaintiff in writing.\" (Id. ,r 122). During a heated meeting, \n\"McColgan put both of his hands on both of [Plaintiff's] breasts and forcefully pushed Plaintiff \n2 out of his office.\" (Id 1134). In another meeting, \"McColgan leaned back in his chair, grabbed \nhis crotch, obscenely gestured toward Plaintiff, and told Plaintiff, 'Don't flatter yourself.'\" (1 \n145). Hantz \"told [Captain] Layfield that she ... wanted McColgan brought up on the ... \ncharge of Conduct Unbecoming an Officer for pushing her in the breasts.\" (Id 1139). In \nresponse, \"Layfield said that he was not going to stand for Plaintiff throwing around the 'female \ncard\"' and had Hantz sit in a conference room for her next two shifts. (Id 11140-41). \n\"Layfield told detectives that he was not going to stop until he got Plaintiff out of Troop \n4.\" (Id 1152). \"[O]n January 29, 2018, Layfield violated policy by calling Plaintiff on vacation \nand prematurely told Plaintiff that she was being transferred to Troop 5.\" (Id 11153, 155). \n\"Troop 5 was the Troop farthest from Plaintiffs home\" and \"the same jurisdiction where \nPlaintiffs brother was found dead on the roadside.\" (Id 11156-57). On February 7, 2018, \nHantz's \"doctor ordered [her] on medical leave indefinitely for Stress and Depression.\" (Id 1 \n162). When Hantz emailed her doctor's note to DSP and Layfield, Layfield shared the note with \nindividuals unauthorized to receive it, stating that the doctor was a \"diet doctor\" and that Hantz \nwas \"nuts\" and out for \"10-81,\" the \"police code for a possible mentally handicapped subject.\" \n(Id 11162-75). \nDSP \"forced Plaintiff out on medical leave on February 9, 2018.\" (Id 1176). On \nOctober 23, 2018, Hantz filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (EEOC). (D.I. 8-2). The next week, Colonel McQueen notified Hantz \nthat DSP \"was separating her from employment effective December 31, 2018.\" (Id 1181 ). The \nEEOC issued a Notice of Right to Sue on March 2, 2021. (Id 15). Hantz filed this lawsuit on \nJune 1, 2021. (D.I. 1). The operative complaint is the FAC. (D.I. 5). Hantz alleges a hostile \nwork environment (Count I), involuntary transfer (Count II), involuntary termination (Count III), \n3 and involuntary transfer and termination in retaliation (Counts IV and V). All counts allege \nviolations of Title VII and the Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act (\"DDEA\"). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Motion to Dismiss \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6), the Court must accept the complaint 's factual allegations as true. Bell At!. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but \nthey must provide more than labels, conclusions, or a \"formulaic recitation \" of the claim \nelements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in \nfact).\"). There must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when the \ncomplaint's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant \nis liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. at 665. \nB. Hostile Work Environment \nTo allege a prima facie hostile work environment claim under Title VII and the DDEA, a \nplaintiff must \"show (1) the employee suffered intentional discrimination because of their sex; \n(2) the discrimination was pervasive and regular; (3) the discrimination detrimentally affected \nthe plaintiff; ( 4) the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same \nsex in that position; and (5) the existence of respondeat superior liability.\" Burgess v. Dollar \nTree Stores, Inc., 642 F. App'x 152, 154-55 (3d Cir. 2016) (citation and quotation marks \nomitted); Hyland v. Smyrna Sch. Dist., 608 F. App'x 79, 82 (3d Cir. 2015) (\"[T]he evidence \n4 needed to prevail under the DDEA is generally the same as that needed to prevail under Title \nVII.\"). \nC. Involuntary Transfer and Termination \nTo state a prima facie case of non-pay related gender discrimination under Title VII and \nthe DDEA, a plaintiff must allege that (1) she is a member of a protected class, (2) an adverse \nemployment action was taken against her, and (3) the circumstances of the adverse action give \nrise to an inference of discrimination. Goosby v. Johnson & Johnson Med., Inc., 228 F.3d 313, \n319 (3d Cir. 2000). \nD. Retaliation \nTo state a claim for retaliation , a plaintiff must allege \"(1) protected employee activity; \n(2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's \nprotected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the protected activity and her employer's \nadverse action.\" Hazen v. Mod. Food Servs., Inc., 113 F. App'x 442,443 (3d Cir. 2004). \n\"Retaliation claims under the DDEA ... should also be analyzed using the same framework.\" \nLehmann v. Aramark Healthcare Support Servs., LLC, 630 F. Supp. 2d 388, 391 (D. Del. 2009). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nDefendant raises a litany of arguments for why I should dismiss Plaintiff's complaint. \nGenerally , I find that Plaintiff has plausibly stated a claim for each Count. I address Defendant's \nless conclusory arguments below. \nA. Count I Alleges a Continuing Violation \nHantz sues under laws that have a 300-day statute of limitations. I can \"consider\u008f the \nentire scope of a hostile work environment claim, including behavior alleged outside the \nstatutory time period ... so long as an act contributing to that hostile environment takes place \n5 within the statutory time period.\" National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 105 \n(2002). \nHantz has alleged dozens of incidents spanning sixteen years of employment. Defendant \nasks me to knock out some of these incidents under the theory that they are \"discrete acts\" and \n\"cannot be aggregated under a continuing violations theory.\" (D.I. 10 at 1 (citing O'Connor v. \nCity of Newark, 440 F.3d 125, 127 (3d Cir. 2006))). Upon removal of the discrete acts, \naccording to Defendant , there are \"temporal interruptions that break the continuing violation \nchain.\" (D.I. 10 at 2-3). Even if Defendant is right that discrete acts cannot be aggregated under \na continuing violation claim, 1 Hantz has alleged many incidents that are not discrete acts. \nConstruing the complaint in the light most favorable to Hantz, these non-discrete acts form a \npattern that extends into the statute of limitations period. The effect of any temporal \ninterruptions on the pattern of hostility ought to be decided on a more complete record, not on a \nmotion to dismiss. \nB. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies \nTitle VII claimants must exhaust their administrative remedies by filing a charge with the \nEEOC prior to filing a lawsuit. Twillie v. Erie Sch. Dist., 575 F. App'x 28, 31 (3d Cir. 2014). \nActs alleged in the lawsuit are properly exhausted when they \"are fairly within the scope of [1] \nthe prior EEOC complaint , or [2] the investigation arising therefrom. \" Simko v. United States \nSteel Corp, 992 F.3d 198,207 (3d Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). Regarding the second prong, \n1 I do not think there is consensus on this. See Deering v. Hackensack Bd. of Educ., 2021 WL \n508608, at *5 n.5 (D.N.J. Feb. 11, 2021) (harmonizing O'Connor with Green v. Brennan, 578 \nU.S. 547, 557 (2016), which described Morgan as \"holding that a hostile-work-en vironment \nclaim is a single 'unlawful employment practice' that includes every act composing that \nclaim, whether those acts are independently actionable or not\"). \n6 \"the Court must only look at the scope of the EEOC investigation that would reasonably grow \nout of, or arise from, the initial charge filed with the EEOC, irrespective of the actual content of \nthe Commission 's investigation.\" Id. at 208-09 (cleaned up). \nMost factual allegations in the FAC were included in the EEOC charge. The FAC's \nnewly alleged incidents are \"sufficiently related\" to the claims in the EEOC charge because \nHantz detailed many of the same incidents over the same timeline, discussed many of the same \nactors, and alleged that she reported sex-based harassment multiple times during her employment \nat DSP. (D.I. 8-2 at 3 of 3); see Simko, 992 F.3d at 210--11 (\"In comparing the two sets of \nallegations, we look for factual similarities or connections between the events described in the \nclaims, the actors involved , and the nature of the employer conduct at issue.\"). \nThe fact that the EEOC charge did not include Hantz's termination is not dispositive. \n\"[T]he parameters of the civil action in the district court are defined by the scope of the EEOC \ninvestigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination , \nincluding new acts which occurred during the pendency of proceedings before the Commission.\" \nRobinson v . Dalton, 107 F.3d 1018, 1025-26 (3d Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted). \nHantz filed her EEOC charge on October 23, 2018. She was fired one week later. (FAC \n,r 181). She received a Notice of Right to sue on March 2, 2021. (FAC ,r 5). \"[A] reasonable \nEEOC investigation would have inquired into the fact of Plaintiff's termination. \" Tourtellotte v. \nEli Lilly & Co., 2013 WL 1628603, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 16, 2013), affd, 636 F. App'x 831 (3d \nCir. 2016) (finding that the plaintiff had properly exhausted post-charge conduct, including \nplaintiff's termination several months after filing the EEOC charge); see also Howze v. Jones & \nLaughlin Steel Corp., 750 F.2d 1208, 1212 (3d Cir. 1984) (allowing plaintiff to amend her \n7 complaint to include \"a claim of retaliation which was never presented to or investigated by the \nEEOC\"). \nDefendant asks me to preclude Hantz from relying on facts not alleged in the charge. \n(D.I. 8 at 10). Under Third Circuit law, Hantz may rely on incidents that would have been within \nthe scope of the EEOC's investigation. Thus, I will not issue such a blanket preclusion at the \nbeginning of the case. \nC. Transfer from Troop 4 to Troop 5 is Plausibly an Adverse Action \nDefendant argues that I should dismiss Hantz' s involuntary transfer in retaliation claim \n(Count IV) in part because Hantz fails to allege an \"adverse action\"-in particular , \"Hantz fails \nto allege how the transfer from Troop 4 to Troop 5 altered her compensation, privileges, status, \nor opportunities .\" (D.I. 8 at 11). Defendant briefly makes the same argument for Hantz's \ninvoluntary transfer claim (Count II). (D.I. 12-13). \nCount II alleges gender discrimination while Count IV alleges retaliation. Each offense \nhas the element \"adverse action,\" though only the discrimination claim requires that the adverse \naction affect a plaintiff's employment status. See Burlington N & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, \n548 U.S. 53, 62-64 (2006) (\"[T]he antiretaliation provision, unlike the [antidiscrimination] \nprovision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of \nemployment.\"). Retaliation simply requires that a \"reasonable employee would have found the \nchallenged action materially adverse .... mean[ing] it well might have dissuaded a reasonable \nworker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination[.]\" Id. at 68 (internal citations \nomitted). \nI think that Hantz has alleged a claim for both counts. The Third Circuit has \"held that \nemployment decisions such as transfers and demotions may suffice to establish the third element \n8 of a plaintiffs prima facie case [ of discrimination]. \" Jones v. Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia , 198 \nF.3d 403, 411-12 (3d Cir. 1999). In Jones, the Third Circuit held that a teacher had suffered an \nadverse employment action when he was transferred schools and was required \"to teach what he \nregarded as less desirable science classes.\" Id. at 412. Here, Hantz has similarly alleged a \ntransfer that she regards as less desirable due to both the distance from her home and because \n\"Troop 5 is the same jurisdiction where Plaintiffs brother was found dead on the roadside[ .]\" \n(FAC 1 157). Hantz also alleges that this transfer was against Defendant 's \"custom not to \ntransfer senior officers unless they requested it.\" (Id. 1153). \nDefendant cites Remp v. Alcon Lab'ys, Inc., 701 F. App'x 103 (3d Cir. 2017) in support of \nits position. (D.I. 10 at 6-7). In the context of a retaliation claim, the Third Circuit held, \n\"transferring a state trooper from one station to another and making his daily commute four and a \nhalf miles longer would not have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or from supporting \na charge of discrimination because the trooper failed to show that the transfer 'was more than a \ntrivial inconvenience. \"' Id. at 108 ( describing Est. of Oliva ex rel. McHugh v. New Jersey, 604 \nF.3d 788, 799 (3d Cir. 2010)). Despite this analogous case,2 I do not find Defendant's argument \npersuasive at the motion to dismiss stage. Both Remp and Estate of Oliva were decided on \nsummary judgment , not motions to dismiss. See 701 F. App'x at 104; 604 F.3d at 790. \nFurthermore , in Estate of Oliva, \"Oliva's transfers ... were consistent with State Police practice \nat the time to assign a newly appointed trooper to his or her first two duty stations for \napproximately six months at each station and then to reassign the new trooper to a third station \n2 Exactly how analogous the case is cannot be determined on a motion to dismiss. While I can \ntake judicial notice of the approximate distances between the two Troops, and I can see the \naddress Plaintiff used when pursuing administrative remedies, I cannot take judicial notice (and \nDefendant does not say that I should, see D.I. 8 at 11 n. 2) that that address is the relevant \naddress for calculation of how much added commute the transfer would add. \n9 for an indefinite period determined by administrative needs and the trooper's preference .\" 604 \nF.3d at 792. Hantz has alleged the opposite-her transfer was inconsistent with DSP's practice \nof not reassigning senior officers. (FAC 1153; see also id. 1159 (\"Defendant has not \ninvoluntaril y transferred any other Sergeant from patrol without disciplinary action.\")). \nThus, I find that Hantz has plausibly pled a prima facie case of involuntary transfer and \ninvoluntary transfer in retaliation. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n10 "}
