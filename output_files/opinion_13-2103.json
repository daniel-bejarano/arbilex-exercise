HALL, U.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \nPlaintiff Christopher H. West , an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center \n(\u201cJTVCC \u201d), commenced this action on December 30, 2013, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I.  \n1.)  He alleges that  Defendants Mark Emig and Jeffrey Carrothers  each subjected him to cruel and \nunusual punishment  in violation of the Eighth Amendment  by depriving him of a mattress for \ncertain periods between 2011 and 2013.  ( Id.) \nThe Court held a bench trial on April 11, 2022.1  (D.I. 131, Ex. 2 (\u201c Tr. __\u201d) .)  Post- trial \nbriefing is complete.  (D.I. 129, 131, 132.)  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), the \nfollowing are the Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nI. FINDINGS OF FACT2 \n1. Mr. West has a long history of swallowing non- edible items.  (JTX  17 at 2.)   Such  \nbehavior increased in frequency during his periods of incarceration.  ( Id.)  Between 2011 and 2013, \nwhile he was incarcerated  at Howard R. Young Correctional Institution (\u201cHRYCI \u201d) and JTVCC, \nMr. West swallowed or tried to swallow at least thirty non -edible items, including staples, pens, \npencils, plastic straws,  screws, paperclips, batteries, the tiles from his prison cell, a spork, a zipper \nfrom his mattress, and the foam from his mattress.  (D. I. 122 (Pre -Trial Order (\u201c PTO \u201d)) \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11; \n \n1 After the District Judge denied- in-part Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment  (D.I. \n96), the parties consented  to have a Magistrate Judge conduct further proceedings in the case, \nincluding trial.  (D.I. 115.)  The parties also consented to a bench trial.  (D.I. 112.)  \n \n2  The following are the Court\u2019s findings of fact.  In determining the credibility of the \nwitnesses, the C ourt has taken into account the rationality and internal consistency of the witness\u2019s \ntestimony, the extent of detail and coherent nature of the testimony, the manner of testifying by \nthe witnesses, and the degree to which the subject testimony is consistent or inconsistent with other evidence in the case.  Moreover, the C ourt has drawn such reasonable inferences  from the credible \ndirect and circumstantial evidence as is permitted by reason and common sense.   \n   \n \n3 \n Tr. 7, 26\u201328, 32\u201333, 81, 84\u201386, 88\u201389, 91\u201392, 105\u201309, 130; JTX 17 at 2\u20134.)   Mr. West has \nprovided various  explanations for his behavior while in prison, including a desire to be taken to \nthe hospital  to obtain pain medication, avoiding incarceration , getting attention, an attempt to \n\u201cmanipulate the system,\u201d and auditory hallucinations  to kill himself .  (JTX at 3\u20134; Tr. 83, 90, 112\u2013\n113, 115\u201317.)   \n2. Mr. West was an inmate at HRYCI in Wilmington, Delaware between July 2011 \nand February 2012.  (PTO \u00b6 9; JTX 17  at 1; Tr. 81 .)  Mr. Emig was the Deputy Warden of HRYCI \nduring that time.  (PT O \u00b6 8.)  Between July and December 2011, Mr. West ate or reported eating \nnon-edible objects on at least seventeen different occasions, resulting in eight outside hospital \ntrips.3  In September  2011, a fter Mr. West was hospitalized for eating part of his mattress, HRYCI \n \n3 Within days of arriving at HRYCI, Mr. West re ported that he had swallowed a paper clip.  \n(JTX 17 at 3.)  On July 8, 2011, he was taken to the hospital, where it was surgically removed.  \nWhile at the hospital, he ate a spork.  ( Id.)  On July 18, 2011, he reported that he had swallowed a \npen and was re turned to the hospital.  ( Id.)  While at the hospital, he attempted to swallow a pen.  \n(Id.)  On August 2, 2011, he reported that he swallowed a pencil and screws, and he was returned \nto the hospital.  ( Id.)  Medical providers performed an endoscopy and re covered the pencil as well \nas a shoestring with metallic rings.  ( Id.)  While still at the hospital, he ingested two batteries from \na heart monitor and a writing object from a nurse\u2019s cart .  (Id.; Tr. 32\u201333, 50.)  On August 12, 2011, \nhe reported that he ingested a pen at the courthouse; it was later determined that he fabricated the \nstory.  (JTX 17 at 3.)  On August 13, 2011, he ingested a piece of foam from a suicide -resistant \nmattress and a spork, and he was br ought by ambulance to the hospital.  (Id.; Tr. 32\u201333, 84\u201385. )  \nOn October 14, 2011, he swallowed more than one spork, a pen, and a pencil.  He was sent to the hospital, where providers performed a laparoscopic procedure and removed nine foreign bodies. (JTX 17 at 3.)  On October 22, he reported that he swallowed pens, pencils, and a spork the day \nbefore.  ( Id. at 4.)  On October 25, 2011,  he ingested tiles from the floor of his cell and was sent to \nthe hospital.  (Id.; Tr. 33 , 50\u201351.)  He returned to prison on October 27 but he went back to the \nhospital after he pulled out his catheter and ate it.  (JTX 17 at 4.)   On October 28, 2011, he ingested \na bottle opener.  He spoke to his mother a few days later and told her that his ingestion of  objects \nwas an attempt to \u201cmanipulate the system.\u201d  ( Id.)  On November 13, 2011, while in prison, he ate \na plastic cup.  (Id.)  On November 23, he reported that he inserted something into his penis and \ningested a pencil.  ( Id.)  An on- site ultrasound was completed but there was no evidence that he \nhad ingested a foreign body.  ( Id.)  He asked to go to the hospital multiple times because he did \nnot want to spend Thanksgiving in prison; instead, providers performed a procedure at HRYCI to \nremove what appeared to be a piece of rice and a small piece of concrete from his penis.  ( Id.)  On \n    \n \n4 \n mental health staff determined that it should be removed from his cell  for his own safety .  (Tr. 10 \u2013\n13, 26\u201327, 84\u201385.)  Mr. Emig \u2019s security officers removed  Mr. West \u2019s mattress  in accordance with \nthe determination of mental health staff .  (Tr. 12, 31\u201332.)    \n3. The parties dispute whether  Mr. West was ever without a mattress at night  at \nHRYCI  and, if so, how long.  They also dispute whether Mr.  Emig  knew that Mr. West was without \na mattress at night and, if so, whether h e knew how long.  At trial, Mr. Emig  testified that, at some \npoint, the mental health unit informed him t hat they had decided that the mattress should be \nremoved from Mr. West\u2019s  cell for his own safety, but  Emig  could not recall the details about when \nthat occurred or for how long, or if the mattress was returned at night .  (Tr.  10, 20\u201321, 24\u201329, 30, \n33, 36, 41.)   Mr. Waltz, a Correctional Officer at HRYCI, testified that he didn\u2019t see a mattress in \nWest\u2019s cell for a period of \u201ca month or so\u201d  after he had ripped his mattress open and  swallowed \nthe stuffing.  (Tr. 45 \u201346, 50, 54.)  However, Mr. Waltz worked the dayt ime shift, and he \u201cc[ouldn\u2019t] \nsay\u201d if West was given a  mattress at night during that time.  (Tr. 51\u201353.)   Mr. West testified that \nhe was deprived of a mattress , including at night, for two periods of time : for one  month starting \nin September  (after he swallowed mattress foam) ; and again for two -and-a-half months between  \nmid-October 2011 (after he swallowed additional items) and January  2012.  (Tr. 84 \u201386, 96.)  Mr. \nWest further testified that, without the mattress, he slept with a blanket at n ight on the floor of his \ncell, which first consisted of tile and , later, concrete.4  (Tr. 91.)  West also testified that  he \npersonally asked Emig to return his mattress .  (Tr. 88\u201389, 99.)    \n \nNovember 24, 2011 (Thanksgiving Day), he reported that he had ingested a pen and toilet paper, \nbut all items were accounted for and he remained at HRYCI .  (Id.)  When pr ison s taff stopped \ntaking West to the hospital absent  evidence that he\u2019d actually swallowed something inedible, he \nstopped making false reports  of swallowing.  (Tr. 112\u201317; JTX 17 at 3\u20134.)  \n \n4 Prison staff removed the tiles from Mr. West\u2019s cell after he ate them.  ( Tr. 90\u201391.)  Staff \nalso removed the screws from the outlets, toilet, and windows so he couldn\u2019t eat them.  (Tr. 51.)     \n \n5 \n 4. The Court only partially credits  Mr. West\u2019s testimony .  The Court finds by a \npreponderance of the evidence that West  lacked a mattress at night  at HRYCI  for at least some \nperiod of time, which was , at most,  approximately one month.  The only evidence that Mr. West \nwas deprived of a mattr ess for longer is his own testimo ny, which is not entirely credible .  West\u2019s \nmemo ries from that time period were \u201cfuzzy\u201d; indeed, by his own admission, he lacked \n\u201cawareness\u201d and had hallucinations around the  same time he says he lacked a mattress .  (Tr. 95\u2013\n96, 106, 119.)   Mr. West testified that \u201cthe time would kind of blur ,\u201d and he could only \u201cpiece [] \ntogether\u201d the sequence of events  at HRYCI  after reviewing records from his Superior Court \ncriminal case, which, he says, refreshed his recollection abou t \u201cwhat was going on with [him] \nbased on those dates.\u201d  (Tr. 108\u2013110, 119\u201320.)  (He did not present those records at trial.)  Although \nMr. West testified that he complained to prison medical staf f about pain from sleeping on the floor, \nhe presented  no medical records documenting any such complaints .  (Tr. 111.)  N or are there  \nrecords  documenting any injuries from sleeping on the floor .  Further, Mr. West\u2019s testimony that \nhe was forced to sleep on the floor for two -and-a-half months between mid-October 2011 and \nJanuary  2012 is inconsistent with other evidence of record, including records documenting that he \nwas in the hospital  in late October , documentary evidence  suggesting that he had at least a plastic \nsleeping boat  for some of the time  that he claims he was forced to sleep  on the floor , and medical \nrecords  from various points during that time period where he  reported sleep  \u201cwithin normal limits .\u201d  \n(JTX 1 9; JTX 28 ; JTX 29; JTX 17 at 3\u20134; JTX 32;  Tr. 48\u201349.)   \n5. The evidence of record , including evidence that Mr.  Emig was being updated about \nWest  during the time he was at HRYCI , permits a reasonable inference that Emig knew that West \nlacked a mattress at night for at least some period of time; however, the evidence  of record  is    \n \n6 \n insufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Emig knew that West was without \na matt ress for a month  or longer .  (Tr.  10\u201313, 18, 20, 26\u201328, 87\u201390.)  \n6. The Court  finds that, during the time s when the mattress was removed from  Mr. \nWest \u2019s cell , it was not because Mr. Emig was punishing West  or indifferent to his well -being.  (Tr. \n33, 41.)  HRYCI staff had never encountered an inmate with such a serious, ongoing ingesting issue , and they were unsure about how to handle an inmate who was eating just about everything  \nhe could get his hands on.  (Tr. 37 , 88, 104\u2013105.)  M r. Emig was concerned about Mr. West\u2019s \nsafety during his stay at HRYCI and, at one point, Emig even called West\u2019s mother.  (Tr. 9\u201310,  87; JTX 27 .)  In December 2011, West was referred to a psychologist  for a behavioral management \nconsultation, and she concluded that West\u2019s \u201cchoice to ingest or insert foreign objects [wa]s an attempt to avoid incarceration and not due to a major mental illness\u201d and t hat his behavior  was \n\u201creinforced by [West] receiving pain medication.\u201d  (JTX 17 at 4; id. at 2 (psychological  evaluation \nnoting that West \u201cendorsed certain combinations of features that are atypical or unusual in clinical \npopulations, but which tend to be c ommon amongst individuals feigning mental disorder\u201d).)   \nPrison staff took Mr. West to the hospital multiple times for care after he reported eating objects.  And w hen West  returned to HRYCI , the staff kept him on Psychological Close Observation \n(\u201cPCO\u201d)  for his own safety, where he was monitored closely (sometimes one -on-one) for twenty-\nfour hours a day.  (Tr. 8 \u201311, 13\u201316, 47\u201349, 107\u2013 108, 120\u201322; JTX 17 at 2 \u20134; JTX 20 ; JTX 22 .)  \nBut even  continuous  one-on-one observation did not prevent Mr. West from  ripping open a \nsuicide -resistant  (non- rip) mattress , swallowing part of  it, and sending himself back to the hospital .  \n(Tr. 32\u201333, 121\u201322.)   The mattress was subsequently removed  from West\u2019s cell for some period  \n(or periods)  of time, but it was not as a punishment; rather , it was based upon the recommendation \nand decision of the mental health staff .  (Tr. 11 \u201313, 33, 41.)  Having considered all of the evidence    \n \n7 \n of record, the Court  conclude s that Mr. West \u2019s treatment  at HRYCI was inconsistent with a finding \nthat any HRYCI  staff were indifferent to Mr. West\u2019s medical needs or well -being. \n7. In April 2013, Mr. West was transferred to JTVCC .  At that time, Defendant \nCarrothers was the S ecurity Superintendent.  (PTO \u00b6\u00b6 10\u201311; Tr. 57.)  Mr. West was initially \nprovided a mattress at JTVCC .  (Tr. 96\u201397.)  At some point after his arrival, he started swallowing \nitems again, including a pen.  (PTO \u00b6  11; Tr. 63 \u201364, 72\u201373, 97.)   He also tried to swallow the \nzipper from his mattress.  ( Tr. 130.)  He  was again placed on PCO , and for some period of time he \nwas on PCO Level I .  (Tr. 58, 63.)  Pursuant to JTVCC practice, inmates on PCO Level I  had their \nmattress es removed in the morning and returned to them in the evening.  (Tr. 61, 66, 72\u201373  \n(explaining that the daytime mattress restriction  prevent ed inmates from using their mattress to \nblock the w indows used to observe them) , 131\u201332, 134.)   \n8. Mr. West has not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that he was ever \ndeprived of a mattress for longer than 16 hours at JTVCC or that he spent a single night without a \nmattress at JTVCC.   The only evidence that Mr. West lacked a mattress at ni ght is his own \ntestimony  that he slept on the floor  for a three -month period from April to June 2012 (Tr. 97 , 102, \n110), which I do not credit for multiple reasons, including that it is inconsistent with \ncontemporaneous documentary evidence suggesting that he was sleeping well and had a bed.  (JTX \n4; JTX 7 ; JTX 12 ; JTX 14 .)  And although Mr. West testified that he complained to medical staff \nabout pain from sleeping on the floor, he presented no records documenting any such complaints  \nor injuries.  (Tr. 111\u2013112 .)   \n9. The Court finds that JTVCC staff did not remove the mattress  from Mr. West\u2019s cell \nduring the daytime  hours to punish him ; rather, it was for legitimate penological reasons, includin g    \n \n8 \n West\u2019s safety .  The Court further finds that M r. Carrothers was not i ndifferent to Mr. West\u2019s health \nor well -being.  \nII. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  \n10. The Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment requires  prison \nofficials to provide humane conditions of confinement to incarcerated persons .  Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833 (1994).  To prove  an Eighth Amendment  violation based on an alleged \ndeprivati on, a prisoner  must establish  that (1) the deprivation was \u201cobjectively, sufficiently \nserious; a prison official\u2019s act or omission must result  in the denial of the minimal civilized \nmeasure of life\u2019s necessities; and (2) the prison official must have been deliberately indifferent to \ninmate health or safety.\u201d  Porter v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 974 F.3d 431, 441 (3d Cir. 2020) (cleaned up) (citing Fa rmer , 511 U.S. at  834).  An official is \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d if he \u201cknows of and \ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d   Id. (citing Farmer , 511 U.S. at 837) ; \nFarmer , 511 U.S. at 834 (\u201cTo violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a prison official \nmust have a \u2018 sufficiently culpable state of mind. \u2019\u201d (quoting Wilson v. Seiter , 501 U.S. 294, 297  \n(1991) ). \n11. \u201cQualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability \nunless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.\u201d   Taylor v. Barkes , 575 U.S. 822, 825 (2015)  (quoting Reichle v. \nHowards , 566 U.S. 658, 664 (2012) ).  \u201cTo be clearly est ablished, a right must be sufficiently clear \nthat every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d   Id.  \n\u201cWhen properly applied, [qualified immunity] protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d   Id. (quoting Ashcroft v. al \u2013Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 743 (2011) ). \nThere is no requirement that the plaintiff  identify \u201ca case directly on point, but existing precedent \nmust have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate. \u201d  Id.  \u201c[C] ourts may grant    \n \n9 \n qualified immunity on the ground that a purported right was not \u2018 clearly established \u2019 by prior case \nlaw, without resolving the often more difficult question whether the purported right exists at all.\u201d   \nReichle, 566 U.S. at  664.  \n12.  Mr. Emig is entitled to qualified immunity.  Mr. West has not identified a Supreme \nCourt or Third Circuit case (or any other case) preceding the alleged deprivation  that says that \nprison officials cannot deprive a prisoner of a mattress at night for a period of less than one month \non the advice of mental health professionals and wit h the intent and purpose of protecting the \nprisoner  (including by preventing him from harming himself by eating the mattress ).5  No  \nprecedent on the books in 2011 to 2012 would have made clear to Mr. Emig that he  was violating \nthe Constitution with respect to Mr. West.   In short, the Court cannot say that only someone \n\u201cplainly incompetent\u201d or who \u201cknowingly violate[ d] the law\u201d  would have acted as Emig did.  \nAshcroft , 563 U.S. at 743. \n13. Mr. Carrothers is also  entitled to qualified immunity.  Mr. West has not identified \na Supreme Court or Third Circuit case (or any other case) preceding the alleged deprivation that says that prison officials cannot remove a mattress from a prisoner\u2019s cell during the daytime hours for legitimate penological reas ons, including to protect prisoners  who required psychological  close \nobservation.  No precedent on the books in 2013 would have made clear to Mr. Carrothers that he was violating the Constitution with respect to Mr. West.  Again, the Court cannot say that only \n \n5 Mr. West cites Mammana v. Federal Bureau of Prisons , 934 F.3d 368 (3d Cir. 2019) , and \nMcClure v. Haste, 820 Fed. App\u2019x 125 (3d Ci r. 2020), but those  cases  postdate the  alleged \nconstitutional violations  here.   Regardless, both of those cases leave open the possibility that a \nmattress might constitutionally be withheld when there is an adequate penological justification.  \nCertainly, neither case says that the Constitution prevents a  prison official from  withholding a \nmattress from a prisone r for less than a month to prevent him from harming himself by eating it.   \nUnlike in McClure, where the inmate\u2019s \u201cmisconduct was completely unrelated to the mattress \nrestriction,\u201d 820 F. App\u2019x at 131, here the mattress restriction was directly related to Mr. West\u2019s self-harm ing behavior .      \n \n10 \n someone \u201cplainly incompetent\u201d or who \u201cknowingly violate[ d] the law\u201d would have acted as \nCarrothers did.  Id.  \n14.  In addition, Mr. West has not established an Eighth Amendment violation for at \nleast the reason that neither Defendant acted with a culpable state of mind or with deliberate \nindifferenc e to Mr. West\u2019s health or safety.  Prison officials had a clear need to prevent West from \nharming himself.  The short -term removal s of his  mattress  were intended to protect his health and \nsafety  and were not  unreasonable course s of action under the circumstances  confronting \nDefendants .  Farmer , 511 U.S. at 845 (\u201c[P]rison officials who act reasonably cannot be found \nliable under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\u201d).   \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity .  \nThe Court further finds that Plaintiff has not  met his burden to establish an Eighth Amendment \nviolation.
