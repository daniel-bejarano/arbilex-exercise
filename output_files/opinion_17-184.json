Fallon", "date": "01-27-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nFRAUNHOFER-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR)\n\nFORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN _ )\nFORSCHUNG E.V., )\nPlaintiff,\nv. 5 Civil Action No. 17-184-JFB-SRF\nSIRUS XM RADIO INC., \u2018\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 27th day of January, 2022, the court having considered defendant\nSirius XM Radio Inc.\u2019s (\u201cSXM\u201d) motion for leave to amend its invalidity contentions (D.I. 503),\nthe briefing and other filings associated with the motion (D.I. 504; D.I. 505; D.I. 509; D.I. 510;\nD.I. 511), and the arguments presented during the January 27, 2022 telephonic motion hearing,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT SXM\u2019s motion to amend is GRANTED for the reasons set\nforth below.\n\n1. Background. Plaintiff Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft Zur F\u00e9rderung der angewandten\nForschung e.V. (\u201cFraunhofer\u201d) filed this case on February 22, 2017, alleging causes of action\nagainst SXM for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,314,289 (\u201cthe \u2019289 patent\u201d), 6,931,084 (\u201cthe\n*1084 patent\u201d), 6,993,084 (\u201cthe \u00b03084 patent\u201d), and 7,061,997 (\u201cthe \u2019997 patent;\u201d collectively,\nthe \u201cpatents-in-suit\u201d). (D.I. 1 at 37-72) The patents-in-suit allegedly cover various aspects of\nSXM\u2019s satellite radio technology.\n\n2. On May 23, 2017, the court entered a scheduling order setting a deadline of\n\nNovember 17, 2017 for SXM to disclose its initial invalidity contentions for each asserted claim,\nalong with the invalidating references. (D.I. 26 at  1(d); Delaware Default Standard for\nElectronic Discovery) The scheduling order did not set forth a deadline for final invalidity\ncontentions. SXM timely served its initial invalidity contentions on November 17, 2017. (D.I.\n491, Ex. 19)\n\n3. In February 2018, petitions for inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d) were filed against the\n\u00b0289 patent (IPR2018-00690), the \u2019997 patent (IPR2018-00681), the \u00b03084 patent (IPR2018-\n00689), and the \u20191084 patent (IPR2018-00682). (D.I. 417 at 8; D.I. 491, Ex. 5 at 1-2; D.L. 495,\nExs. $2-S11) The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) did not institute proceedings or\nissue a final decision on three of the four patents-in-suit. (D.I. 427 at ] 9; D.I. 417 at 8) With\nrespect to the \u2019289 patent, the PTAB instituted proceedings and issued a final written decision in\nJuly 2020 finding that SXM \u201cfail{ed] to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nchallenged claims are unpatentable.\u201d (D.I. 417 at 8)\n\n4. On July 31, 2020, SXM served an interrogatory response identifying its prior art\nand invalidity arguments. (D.I. 495, Ex. S12 at 8) The interrogatory response incorporated by\nreference SXM\u2019s arguments from the IPR proceedings and initial invalidity contentions. (/d.)\n\n5. SXM filed its answer to Fraunhofer\u2019s amended complaint on April 8, 2021. (D.I.\n421) In its counterclaims, SXM identified the prior art references associated with its invalidity\narguments for each of the four patents-in-suit. (/d. at ff] 24, 32, 40, 48)\n\n6. On April 22, 2021, the court entered a case narrowing order instructing SXM to\nreduce the number of prior art references to no more than 44. (D.I. 427) SXM made its election\nthe following month, narrowing its invalidity case to 35 prior art references. (D.I. 436; D.I. 491,\nEx. 2) SXM\u2019s election prompted a flurry of correspondence between the parties over the course\n\nof nearly five months, culminating in Fraunhofer\u2019s motion to strike 13 newly cited prior art\nreferences asserted by SXM in its election. (D.I. 491, Exs. 4-15) On December 6, 2021, the\ncourt issued an order denying Fraunhofer\u2019s motion to strike and instructing SXM to move for\nleave to amend its invalidity contentions. (D.I. 497) In accordance with the order, SXM filed\nthe instant motion to amend its invalidity contentions on December 14, 2021. (D.I. 503)\n\n7. Legal standard. SXM moves for leave to amend its invalidity contentions under\nthe good cause standard pursuant to Rule 16(b)(4), which provides that \u201c[a] schedule may be\nmodified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d (D.I. 504 at 2) As stated at 2,\nsupra, the scheduling order in this case does not provide a deadline for amending contentions.\nNonetheless, the court\u2019s case narrowing order functions as part of the court-ordered case\nschedule. See, e.g., Inre ChanBond, LLC Patent Litig., C.A. No. 15-842-RGA, 2019 WL\n2098316, at *1 (D. Del. May 14, 2019) (applying good cause standard to new invalidity\ncombination introduced after case narrowing deadlines in scheduling order had expired). The\ngood cause framework is instructive in this case-specific inquiry and has been applied in cases\ngoverned by a scheduling order that does not provide a deadline for amending contentions. See,\ne.g., Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp., C.A. No. 13-440-LPS, D.L. 233 Oral Order\n(D. Del. Apr. 15, 2016).\n\n8. In determining whether a movant has demonstrated good cause to amend its\ncontentions, the court considers whether the movant has shown diligence, the importance of the\nnew information, evidence of gamesmanship in the untimely disclosure, the potential prejudice\nto the opposing party, and the likelihood of disruption to the case schedule. See British\nTelecommc ns PLC v. IAC/InterActiveCorp., C.A. No. 18-366-WCB, 2020 WL 3047989, at * 2\n(D. Del. June 8, 2020) (citing Bayer Cropscience AG v. Dow AgroSciences LLC, 2012 WL\n\n12904381, at *2-3 (D. Del. Feb. 27, 2012)).\n9. Analysis. On balance, the good cause factors weigh in favor of granting SXM\u2019s\nmotion for leave to amend its invalidity contentions. Under the particular circumstances of this\ncase, SXM\u2019s previous disclosure of its prior art references and theories during fact discovery\nsuffices to satisfy the diligence requirement. Specifically, SXM disclosed its reliance on\nadmitted prior art described in the asserted patents and its intention to rely on prior art identified\nin future inter partes review proceedings in its initial invalidity contentions served in 2017. (D.I.\n491, Ex. 18 at 6-8) SXM subsequently incorporated by reference the filings in each of the IPR\nproceedings in response to Fraunhofer\u2019s interrogatories seeking disclosure of SXM\u2019s prior art\nand invalidity arguments for each asserted claim. (D.I. 495, Ex. S12) SXM outlined additional\ndetails regarding the specific disclosure of each prior art reference in its correspondence with\nFraunhofer in June 2021. (D.I. 491, Ex. 7 at 3-8) SXM\u2019s disclosure of the prior art references in\nits initial invalidity contentions and interrogatory responses satisfied its duty to timely disclose\nthe references and SXM\u2019s intent to rely on those references during fact discovery. Cf\nBridgestone Sports Ltd. v. Acushnet Co., C.A. No. 05-132-JJF, 2007 WL 521894, at *5 (D. Del.\nFeb. 15, 2007) (denying motion for leave to supplement invalidity contentions because the\ndefendant did not timely identify the additional references); Praxair, Inc. v. ATMI, C.A. No. 03-\n1158-SLR, 2005 WL 3159054, at *4 (D. Del. Nov. 28, 2005) (\u201cPrior art references must be\ndisclosed during fact discovery and the parties must disclose their intent to rely thereon,\nregardless of whether or not the opposing party is aware of the reference.\u201d).\n\n10. During oral argument, Fraunhofer conceded that invalidating references disclosed\nas such in the IPR proceedings were timely, but argued that a second category of references, such\nas the Eureka 147, were disclosed only as background references throughout fact discovery.\n\n(1/27/2022 Tr.) Although the Eureka 147 reference was disclosed in a \u201cgeneral high-level\noverview of the state of the art as it relates to certain technologies and features at issue in the\nAsserted Claims,\u201d Fraunhofer contends that this disclosure of the Eureka 147 as a background\nreference was not sufficient to put it on notice of SXM\u2019s intention to rely on the Eureka 147 as\nan invalidating reference matched to particular claim elements. (D.I. 491, Ex. 18 at 8, 12-13;\n1/27/2022 Tr.; D.I. 509 at 6) Fraunhofer relies on British Telecommunications PLC v.\nIAC/InterActiveCorp., C.A. No. 18-366-WCB, 2020 WL 3047989 (D. Del. June 8, 2020), in\nsupport of its position that the belated disclosure of the Eureka 147 as an invalidating prior art\nreference demonstrates a lack of diligence on SXM\u2019s part. But the British Telecommunications\ndecision confirms that the diligence inquiry alone is not always dispositive. Although the court\nin British Telecommunications determined that counsel did not act with diligence in disclosing\nthe Welsh reference, the court proceeded to consider the remaining good cause factors,\nconcluding that there was no gamesmanship and minimal prejudice to the plaintiff. Id. at *4.\nIndeed, the court\u2019s ultimate denial of the motion for leave to amend the invalidity contentions\nwas based on a lengthy discussion of the Welsh reference\u2019s lack of importance to the case, in\naddition to the lack of diligence. Jd. at *5. For the reasons set forth in the ensuing paragraphs,\nthe balance of factors in this case weighs in favor of permitting the amendment, despite the fact\nthat SXM could have acted with greater diligence in disclosing certain invalidity theories.\n\n11. Although Fraunhofer suggests that the disclosure of prior art references and\narguments must take the form of invalidity contentions to satisfy the diligence requirement,\nauthority cited by Fraunhofer confirms that disclosure in an interrogatory response is sufficient.\nSee Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., Ltd., 2012 WL 2499929, at *1 (N.D. Cal. June 27, 2012)\n(\u201cEven if disclosed somewhere, the parties have forced each other to comb through the\n\nextraordinarily voluminous record to find [the patent contentions], rather than simply amending\ntheir contentions or interrogatory responses as they should.\u201d); see also Gavrieli Brands LLC v.\nSoto Massini (USA) Corp., C.A. No. 18-462-MN, 2019 WL 10248462, at *2 (D. Del. Apr. 18,\n2019) (finding prior art reference was timely disclosed, despite failure to include it in invalidity\ncontentions, because it was cited in the defendants\u2019 opposition to a TRO motion and a physical\nsample was brought to a fact witness deposition). Indeed, courts have indicated that timely,\ndetailed interrogatory responses setting forth invalidity arguments are sufficient to demonstrate\ndiligence, and invalidity contentions may later be amended to align those contentions with the\ninterrogatory responses. See Return Mail, Inc. v. United States, 152 Fed. Cl. 455, 458-60 (Fed.\nCl. 2021). Any delay by SXM in seeking to amend its invalidity contentions and chart its prior\nart references is offset by its timely disclosure of prior art references and invalidity theories\nduring fact discovery. Nonetheless, the court reiterates the importance of charting allegedly\ninvalidating prior art references in a timely manner as a matter of best practices. (D.I. 497 at { 2)\nAs stated in British Telecommunications, SXM ultimately \u201cmay not use . . . non-charted\nreferences as invalidating prior art references.\u201d 2020 WL 3047989, at *6.\n\n12. As previously discussed, the remaining factors weigh in favor of permitting\nSXM\u2019s proposed amendment. (D.L. 497 at 2 n.2) Fraunhofer has failed to show that it would be\nprejudiced by the amended invalidity contentions where, as here, the prior art references and the\nmajority of prior art arguments were disclosed during fact discovery and Fraunhofer had an\nopportunity to take discovery on them after they were disclosed. See Return Mail, 152 Fed. Cl.\nat 460 (rejecting the assertion that defendant \u201cfailed to timely identify the evidentiary bases for\nits contentions\u201d based on the timing of the defendant\u2019s supplementation of its interrogatory\nresponses identifying the invalidity theories); Twilio, Inc. v. TeleSign Corp., 2017 WL 3581186,\n\nat *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 18, 2017). Fraunhofer suggests that SXM\u2019s delayed amendment would\nhave influenced Fraunhofer\u2019s claim construction strategies if the proposed amendment were\ndisclosed earlier. (D.I. 509 at 8) (citing Imperium IP Holdings v. Samsung Elecs. Co. Ltd., 2016\nWL 3854700, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 28, 2016)). But the parties\u2019 claim construction briefing\ncoincided with the filing of the IPR petitions in February 2018, and SXM had indicated a\nforward-looking intention to rely on those arguments in its initial invalidity contentions served in\n2017. (See, e.g., D.I. 112; D.I. 115; D.I. 116; D.I. 491, Ex. 18 at 6; D.I. 417 at 8; D.I. 491, Ex. 5\nat 1-2; D.I. 495, Exs. S2-S11) Fact discovery remained open for more than two years after the\nIPR petitions were filed. (D.I. 280) Yet the record shows that Fraunhofer chose not to pursue\ncertain fact discovery relevant to SXM\u2019s invalidity contentions. (D.I. 322, Ex. F at 1; Ex. G)\nFraunhofer\u2019s general arguments regarding unspecified strategic decisions it would have made are\nnot sufficient to establish prejudice, and Fraunhofer\u2019s experts will have sufficient time in this\ncase to fully consider any newly charted invalidity theories.\n\n13. | Moreover, the challenged prior art references are important to SXM\u2019s invalidity\ncase, comprising more than a third of the references elected by SXM. (D.I. 491, Ex. 2; Ex. 4)\nThis factor weighs in favor of granting leave to amend because \u201c[c]ourts in the Third Circuit\nfavor resolution of disputes on their merits, particularly with respect to patent validity issues,\nwhich raise public interest concerns extending beyond the immediate dispute between the\nparties.\u201d EMC Corp. v. Pure Storage, Inc., 154 F. Supp. 3d 81, 93 (D. Del. 2016).\n\n14. Finally, SXM\u2019s amended invalidity contentions are not likely to disrupt the case\nschedule because the trial date and expert discovery deadlines were vacated pending the\nconclusion of fact depositions of foreign-based witnesses, and the court\u2019s efforts to set a new\ncase schedule during the January 27, 2022 proceedings were paused by Fraunhofer\u2019s\n\nrepresentation that it filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the Federal Circuit. (3/4/2021 Oral\nOrder; 1/27/2022 Tr.) Under similar circumstances in which \u201ctrial has not been scheduled and is\nnot even imminent\u201d and expert discovery has not yet begun, courts have found that this factor\nweighs in favor of permitting amendment. Bayer Cropscience AG v. Dow AgroSciences LLC,\nC.A. No. 10-1045-RMB-JS, 2012 WL 12904381, at *3 (D. Del. Feb. 27, 2012). The fact that a\nMarkman decision has already been issued in this case does not alter the balance on this factor\nunder the circumstances presented by this case. See Intellectual Ventures I LLC, C.A. No. 13-\n440-LPS, Oral Order, D.I. 233 (D. Del. Apr. 15, 2016) (finding no disruption of case schedule\nwhere trial was a year away and the case schedule did not provide a deadline for amending\ncontentions, even though the Markman hearing was held the previous year).\n\n15. | SXM indicates that the proposed amended invalidity contentions submitted in\nconnection with the pending motion were drafted in a manner to comply with the court\u2019s 50-page\nlimit on exhibits. (D.I. 497 at \u00a7 3; D.I. 505, Ex. A at 2n.1) On or before close of business on\nFebruary 3, 2022, SXM shall serve fulsome amended final invalidity contentions on Fraunhofer\nwithout constraints on the number of pages.\n\n16. Conclusion. In view of the foregoing analysis, SXM\u2019s motion to amend its\ninvalidity contentions (D.I. 503) is GRANTED.\n\n17. This Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written\nobjections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Order.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to five (5) pages\n\neach.\n18. The parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72, dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nwww.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\n"}
