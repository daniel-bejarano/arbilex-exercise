INTRODUCTION Civil Action No. 21-200-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nPresently pending before the Court is Petitioner Judeau S. Brown, Jr.'s Motion to \nbe Released on Bail Pending Outcome of Habeas Proceeding (D.I. 5), his Motion to \nSupplement the Motion for Bail (D.I. 6), and his Motion for a Three Judge Panel to \npreside over his request for bail (D.I. 14). For the reasons set forth below, the Court will \ngrant Petitioner 's Motion to Supplement , but will deny his Motion for Bail and his Motion \nfor a Three Judge Panel. \nII. BACKGROUND \nIn May 2018, Petitioner pied guilty to possession of a firearm during the \ncommission of a felony and first degree robbery. See Brown v. State, 234 A.3d 159 \n(Table), 2020 WL 2847866, at *1 (Del. June 1, 2020). The Delaware Superior Court \nsentenced him to a total of twenty-nine years, suspended after four years for decreasing levels of supervision. See id. Petitioner did not appeal his convictions or sentence . He \ndid, however, file a motion for reduction of sentence , two motions for post-conviction \nrelief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 motion, and a motion for a \nnew trial, all of which were denied. (D.I. 4 at 11-18) Petitioner appealed the denial of his \nRule 61 motions, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's \njudgments. See Brown v. 2020 WL 2847866 (first Rule 61 motion); Brown v. State, 242 \nA.3d 1086 (Table), 2020 WL 7212719 (Del. Dec. 3, 2020) (second Rule 61 motion). \nIll. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nFederal courts in the Third Circuit have the authority to release state prisoners on \nbail pending habeas review when the \"petitioner has raised substantial constitutional \nclaims upon which he has a high probability of success\" and \"extraordinary or \nexceptional circumstances exist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the \nhabeas remedy effective.\" Landano v. Rafferty, 970 F.2d 1230, 1239 (3d Cir. 1992). \nCases presenting extraordinary circumstances warranting bail typically involve the \nprisoner's severe health problems or \"the impending completion of the prisoner's \nsentence. \" Id. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nPetitioner asks the Court to release him on bail pending the outcome of his \nhabeas proceeding for the following reasons: (1) he was released on bail prior to \npleading guilty in state court and never posed a flight risk; (2) he did not violate the no\u00ad\ncontact order when was on bail before, and he will not pose a danger to the victims, his \nco-defendants , or the community if he is released on bail now; (3) the Petition will \"likely \nresult in reversal\"; (4) he is \"in imminent danger of contracting COVID-19 , resulting in \n2 injury and death,\" and officers in his prison are \"deliberately and intentionally not \nwearing face masks\"; and (5) in exchange for granting bail, he \"will waive any and all \ndeliberate indifference civil actions against officers at JTVCC and the State of Delaware , \nand will refrain from sharing photographs of officers with any person, media outlets, etc. \nthat may arise from any Covid-19 related incidents.\" (D. I. 5 at 1-2) Petitioner also asks \nto supplement his Motion for Bail with exhibits showing correctional officers not wearing \nmasks and the grievances he filed with respect the lack of mask wearing. (0.1. 6) \nThe Court grants Petitioner's Motion to Supplement his Motion for Bail with \nexhibits showing correctional officers not wearing masks and the prison grievance \nreports he filed with respect the lack of mask wearing, but denies his Motion for Three\u00ad\nJudge Panel. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284(a), a three-judge panel must be convened \nwhen required by an Act of Congress or for actions challenging the apportionment of \ncongressional districts. Petitioner's request for bail does not fall within either of these \ntwo categories . \nAs for Petitioner 's Motion for Bail, the Court concludes that Petitioner has failed \nto meet the difficult standard for bail pending habeas litigation. Petitioner's succinct \nstatement that the arguments in his Petition will result in the reversal of his conviction \ndoes not demonstrate that his constitutional claims have a high probability of success. \nEven if the Court were to presume that he has satisfied the substantial probability of \nsuccess requirement, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. \nNotably, Petitioner does not allege that he suffers from a serious medical condition or \nthat the completion of his seven-year sentence is impending. Given the absence of \nmedical concerns , Petitioner 's argument that he is in imminent danger of contracting \n3 COVID-19 also fails to establish exceptional circumstances . The Court in no way means \nto minimize the impact of COVID-19 , but the potential for contracting COVID-19 applies \nto every pending habeas case involving an incarcerated petitioner. Finally, Petitioner 's \ncontention that he will refrain from pursuing civil actions or sharing photos of \ncorrectional officers if he is released on bail is more akin to a bribe than a reason for \nrelease, and does not warrant any further discussion . Given these circumstances , the \nCourt denies Petitioner 's Motion for Bail. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court grants Petitioner 's Motion to \nSupplement, but denies his Motion for a Three Judge Panel and his Motion for Bail. \nA separate Order follows. \nDated: January 21, 2022 \nChief Judge \n4 "}
