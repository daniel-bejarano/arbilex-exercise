C.A. No. 20-359-LPS-CJB \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nWHEREAS, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (\"F AC\") on May 26, 2020 (see \nD.I. 3); \nWHEREAS, Honeywell International Inc. (\"Honeywell\") and Woodward, Inc. \n(\"Woodward ,\" and together with Honeywell , \"Defendants \") moved to dismiss certain negligent \nmisrepresentation claims in the FAC (see D.I. 16); \nWHEREAS , Magistrate Judge Burke issued a first Report and Recommendation , in \nwhich he recommended that Defendants ' motion to dismiss be granted (see D.I. 46); \nWHEREAS , Plaintiffs did not file any objections to the first Report and \nRecommendation ; \nWHEREAS, the Court adopted the first Report and Recommendation in full and granted \nDefendants ' motion to dismiss (see D.I. 47); \nWHEREAS, the Court provided Plaintiffs with an opportunity to amend their complaint \n1 to address the deficiencies identified in the first Report and Recommendation (see D.I. 46 at 10); \nWHEREAS , Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint (\"SAC\") on March 31, 2021 \n(see D.l. 50); \nWHEREAS , Defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss the negligent \nmisrepresentation claims asserted in Counts VIII and XII (see D.I. 51); \nWHEREAS , Judge Burke issued another Report and Recommendation , in which he \nrecommended that Defendants ' renewed motion to dismiss be granted (see D.I. 65); \nWHEREAS , Plaintiffs timely filed objection s to the latest Report and Recommendation \non November 9, 2021 (see D.I. 66); \nWHEREAS , Plaintiffs certified that their objections \"do[] not raise new legal or factual \narguments\" (D.I. 67); \nWHEREAS , on November 23, 2021, Defendants responded to Plaintiffs' objections (see \nD.I. 68); \nWHEREAS , the Court has carefully reviewed Plaintiffs ' objections to the latest Report \nand Recommendation and Defendants ' response (see D.I. 67, 68), as well as the underlying \nbriefing on Defendants ' renewed motion to dismiss Counts VIII and XII (see D.I. 51, 56, 57); \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs ' objections (D.I. 66) \nare OVERRULED, the latest Report and Recommendation (D.I. 65) is ADOPTED, and \nDefendants' renewed motion to dismiss (D.I. 51) is GRANTED. \n1. Plaintiffs do not meaningfull y dispute the merits of the latest Report and \nRecommendation. Judge Burke determined that Plaintiffs ' negligent misrepresentation claims \nagainst Defendants , as currently pled, should not proceed because \"the SAC does not sufficientl y \n2 plead the 'where' or the 'what' that is required\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). \n(D.I. 65) Accordingly, Judge Burke explained that \"Defendants and the Court are still left \nguessing as to what are the specific communications that Plaintiffs mean to reference.\" (Id.) \nThe Court agrees with this analysis. \n2. In their objections, Plaintiffs argue that, \"given the somewhat different standard \napplicable to a claim for negligent misrepresentation as opposed to fraud ... their claims should \nwithstand a challenge at this point in the litigation.\" (D.I. 66 at 1) Setting aside that Plaintiffs \nhave not specifically articulated the \"somewhat different standard\" to which they believe they \nshould be held, their current position contradicts their earlier position. In briefing the renewed \nmotion to dismiss, Plaintiffs agreed that Judge Burke had \"properly applied the law and \nstandard\" when he issued the first Report and Recommendation . (D.I. at 9 n.3) In other words, \nPlaintiffs already agreed that Judge Burke correctly applied Rule 9(b) to the negligent \nmisrepresentation claims because they sound in fraud. See generally Cavi v. Evolving Sys. NC, \nInc., 2018 WL 2372673, at *2 (D. Del. May 24, 2018) (\"The heightened pleading standard \nrequired by Rule 9(b) extends to claims of negligent misrepresentation ... that 'sound in \nfraud.\"'). Plaintiffs cannot now reverse course. See generally Clark v. Coupe, 2019 WL \n1349484, at *5 (D. Del. Mar. 26, 2019) (stating that parties' objections may not raise new \narguments that parties did not make before Magistrate Judge). \n3. Plaintiffs request that the latest Report and Recommendation \"be modified to \ndismiss [Counts VIII and XII] without prejudice , to allow Plaintiffs to file a motion for leave to \namend the Complaint should the record provide additional support for the assertion of claims for \nnegligent misrepresentation. \" (D.I. 66 at 2) Plaintiffs forfeited this argument by failing to ask \n3 Judge Burke for another opportunity to amend their complaint with respect to the negligent \nmisrepresentation claims. See generally Clark, 2019 WL 1349484, at *5 (\"[A] party wishing to \nmake new arguments in an objection to a Magistrate Judge's recommended disposition must \nidentify them and describe good cause for failing to previousl y make the argument before the \nMagistrate Judge.\"). \n4. In any event, the Court agrees with Defendants that it would be futile to give \nPlaintiffs yet another chance to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs have not identified any \nadditional factual allegations that they could plead, now or in the future, that would cause Counts \nVIII and XII to state claims on which relief may be granted. See In re NAHC, Inc. Sec. Litig., \n306 F.3d 1314, 1332 (3d Cir. 2002) (affirming dismissal without leave to amend because \nplaintiffs did \"not specify what additional facts, if any, they would plead if given another \nopportunity to amend\"). Moreover , Plaintiffs have already had several opportunities to plead \nthese claims and are not entitled to yet another opportunity . See United States ex rel. Schumann \nv. AstraZeneca Pharms. L.P., 769 F.3d 837, 849 (3d Cir. 2014) (\"[A] District Court has \ndiscretion to deny a plaintiff leave to amend where the plaintiff was put on notice as to the \ndeficiencies in his complaint , but chose not to resolve them.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). \nMarch 29, 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware \n4 ~~Jw~ \nUNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE "}
