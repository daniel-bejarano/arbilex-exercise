{"case_name": "NNCrystal US Corporation v. Nanosys, Inc.", "case_number": "19-1307", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "04-12-2022", "ocr_text": "1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nNNCRYSTAL US CORPORATION and  \nTHE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE  \nUNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS,  \n       \n  Plaintiff s,    \n       \n v.        \n     \nNANOSYS, INC. , \n \n  Defendant.    Civil Action No. 19- 1307- RGA \n  \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \n \n Plaintiffs seek to amend their First Amended Complaint to assert claims of willful \ninfringement, induced infringement, and infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g). (D.I. 75  at 1).  \nDefendant objects . I have considered the parties\u2019 briefing (D.I. 75, 83, 97) and address each of \nDefendant\u2019s objections in turn. \nDefendant argues Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendment to assert willful infringement is futile \nand unduly delayed.  (D.I. 83 at 2- 3). Because I agree with Defendant that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \namend to allege willful infringement is  futile , I do not reach Defendant\u2019s argument regarding undue \ndelay . Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Defendant was aware of (1) license agreements covering \u201cthe \n\u2019051 patent technology\u201d ( i.e., not the \u2019051 patent itself) and (2) the application that became the \n\u2019051 patent , are not, as a matter of law,  sufficient to plausibly allege pre -suit knowledge of the \n\u2019051 patent. (D.I. 75- 1 \u00b6\u00b6 40, 45- 46); State Indus., Inc. v. A. O. Smith Corp., 751 F.2d 1226, 1236 \n(Fed. Cir. 1985). Nor are Plaintiffs\u2019 general allegations relating to Defendant\u2019s \u201csophistication\u201d 2 \n and routine  IP monitoring and freedom to operate activities specific enough  to move the ne edle on \nthe plausibility of  Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of  pre-suit knowledge. (D.I. 75- 1 \u00b6\u00b6 5 0-51). Because \nPlaintiffs\u2019  proposed amendments  do not plausibly allege pre -suit knowledge, they  are insufficient \nto state a claim of willful infringement, and therefore futile . Wrinkl, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc., 2021 \nWL 4477022, at *7 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021).1 For these reasons , Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend to \nstate a claim of willful infringement is DENI ED. \n Defendant argues Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendment to assert infringement under \u00a7 271(g) is \nfutile because Plaintiffs have not alleged  \u201cfacts or assertions\u201d in support of their  claim that Nanosys \n\u201cimports in the United States or uses, offers to sell, or sells\u201d products manufactured abroad using \nthe claimed  process . (D.I. 83 at 9). I disagree. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that (1) Defendant partners \nwith a foreign manufacturer that manufactures colloidal nanocrystal s using a process that infringes \nthe Asserted Claims , and (2) Defendant \u201csells and/or offers to sell within the United States one or \nmore of the Nanosys Quantum Dot Products prepared by its manufacturing partner(s) using processes that infringe at least claims 1 and/or 22 of the\u2019051 patent\u201d are suffic ient to plausibly \nstate a claim of infringement under \u00a7 271(g). (D.I. 75- 1 \u00b6\u00b6 31 -32). Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \namend to state a claim of infringement under \u00a7 271(g) is GRANTED.  \n \n1  Plaintiffs a rgue Wrinkl  is inapposite because \u201chere the SAC alleges that Defendant\u2019s post -\nsuit continuation of its pre -suit infringing behavior despite receiving the adverse PTAB decision \nmakes its continued willful infringement particularly egregious.\u201d (D.I. 97 at 7). I disagree. The \nreasoning relied  upon in Wrinkl  is no less applicable following a post -suit IPR proceeding where \nthe PTAB d id not find the challenged claims invalid. Wrinkl , 2021 WL 4477022 at *7 (explaining \n\u201cwillfulness based on post -suit knowledge is a black box\u201d because \u201cDefendants usually act on the \nbasis of the advice of counsel once they are sued.\u201d).  PTAB\u2019s findings related to validity have no \nbearing  on the issue of infringement . 3 \n Finally, Defendant argues Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendment to assert induced infringement \nis futile, because Plaintiffs  do not plausibly allege any of the three elements required for a claim \nof induced infringement \u2013 direct infringement, knowledge, and specific intent. (D.I. 83 at 7). I find \nthat because Plaintiffs have not alleged  any acts of  direct infringement by a third party in the United \nStates , Plaintiffs have not  stated a claim of  induced infringement under \u00a7 271(b) . See Enplas \nDisplay Device Corp. v. Seoul Semiconductor Co., LTD., 909 F. 3d 398, 408 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ; \nMerial  Ltd. v. Cipla Ltd., 681 F.3d 1283, 1302- 03 (Fed. Cir. 2012)  (\u201c[W]here a foreign party, with \nthe requisite knowledge and intent, employs extraterritorial means to actively induce acts of direct \ninfringement that occur wit hin the United States , such conduct is not categorically exempt from \nredress under \u00a7 271(b)\u201d)  (emphasis added) .  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that their allegation  of infringement under \u00a7 271(g) can serve as the \nrequisite  underlying direct infringement  for their c laim of induced infringement  is nonsensical. \n(D.I. 97 at 8). Section 271(g) creates  direct infringement liability for the importer /seller  of goods \nmanufactured using patented processes \u2013 not for the manufacturer. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g) (\u201cWhoever \nwithout authority imports into the United States or offers to sell, sells, or uses within the United States a product which is made by a process patented in the United States shall be liable as an \ninfringer  . . . .\u201d). Defendan t cannot induce itself to infringe , and Plaintiffs have not specifically \nalleged that any of Nanosys\u2019s  foreign  manufacturing partners act as U.S. importers or sellers .\n2 \nTherefore, Plaintiffs \u2019 motion to amend to state a claim of induced infringement is DENIED . \n \n2  Plaintiffs allege, \u201cNanosys has induced others to infringe at least claims 1 and/or 22 of  the \n\u2019051 patent, including by inducing its manufacturing partner(s) to manufacture and import into the \nUnited States [products made using the Claimed Process] ,\u201d and \u201cNanosys specifically intended its \nmanufacturing partner(s) to manufacture and import into the United States [products made used \nthe Claimed Process] .\u201d (D.I. 75- 1 \u00b6\u00b6 34, 35). Outside of these  conclusory allegations of Nanosys\u2019s 4 \n For these reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion  is GRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART. \nPlaintiffs are GRANTED leave to amend their First Amended Complaint  to allege infringement \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g). Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is otherwise DENIED.  \n \n \n \nIT IS SO ORDER ED. \n  \n \n \n  Entered this 12\nth day of  April , 2022. \n   \n/s/ Richard G. Andrews ____ \nUnited States District Judge  \n \nspecific intent, however, Pl aintiffs do not  specifically  allege that any of Nanosys\u2019s manufacturing \npartners themselves import infringing products into the United States. Instead, Plaintiffs allege \nShoei Chemical, Nanosys\u2019s manufacturing partner , \u201cmanufacture[s] one or more of the Na nosys \nQuantum Dot Products on [Nanosys\u2019s]  behalf,\u201d and \u201cNanosys sells and/or offers to sell within the \nUnited States one or more of the Nanosys Quantum Dot Products prepared by its manufacturing \npartner(s) . . . .\u201d ( Id. \u00b6 30, 32).
