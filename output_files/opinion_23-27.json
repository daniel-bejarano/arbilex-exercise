No. 23-27-CFC \n) \nWSOU HOLDINGS, LLC and ) \nWSOU CAPITAL PARTNERS, LLC,) \n) \nThird-Party Defendants. ) \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nThis miscellaneous action was initiated on January 20, 2023 with the filing \nby Salesforce, Inc. of a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 to \ncompel WSOU Holdings, LLC and WSOU Capital Partners, LLC (collectively, \nWSOU) to comply with certain subpoenas served by Salesforce in a series of \npatent infringement cases in the Western District of Texas (WSOU Investments, \nLLC v. Salesforce, Inc., Case Nos. 6:20-cv-01163 through 6:20-cv-01172 (ADA) (W.D. Tex.)). D.I. 2. Salesforce requested, and I granted it, leave to file its motion \nand supporting papers under seal with the condition that it file within seven days \npublic versions of the motion and supporting papers. D.I. 7. \nPending before me is WSOU' s motion for leave to file under seal ( 1) its \nanswering brief in opposition to Salesforce' s motion, (2) its opening brief filed in \nsupport of its own motion to transfer the action to the Western District of Texas, \n(3) its exhibits filed in support of those briefs, and (4) its disclosure statement \nrequired by Rule 7 .1 and my Standing Orders regarding Disclosure Statements and \nThird-Party Litigation Funding Arrangements. D.I. 15. WSOU's motion for leave \nto file under seal prompted me to review all the filings the parties have maintained \nunder seal to date. \nI started with the parties' briefs (D.I. 3; D.I. 16; D.I. 20); and, because the \nparties justified the sealing of those briefs in part because the briefs quote from a \nsealed discovery hearing conducted by Judge Gilliland in the Western District of \nTexas, I shared copies of the briefs with Judge Gilliland to get his views on the \nappropriateness of maintaining the briefs under seal. I determined, and Judge \nGilliland agreed, that no good cause exists to maintain the briefs under seal. \nI then turned to the exhibits the parties filed with their briefs. Both sides \nfiled as an exhibit the sealed transcript of Judge Gilliland's discovery hearing. See \n2 D.I. 17-10; D.I. 21-6. Judge Gilliland had sealed the transcript at the joint request \nof the parties. Because he has yet to unseal it, I will maintain the transcript \nexhibits under seal. \nI see no basis to keep under seal any of the other exhibits filed by WSOU \n(D.1. 17-1; D.I. 17-2; D.I. 17-3; D.I. 17-4; D.L 17-5; D.I. 17-6; D.I. 17-7; D.I. 17-8; \nD.I. 17-9; D.I. 17-11; D.I. 17-12; D.I. 17-13); nor do I see any good cause to \nmaintain under seal Exhibits 1-4, 7-11, 17, and 20-29 filed by Salesforce in \nsupport of its motion (D.1. 21-1; D.I. 21-2; D.I. 21-3; D.I. 21-4; D.I. 21-7; D.I. 21-\n8; D.I. 21-9; D.I. 21-10; D.I. 21-11; D.I. 21-17; D.I. 21-20; D.I. 21-21; D.I. 21-22; \nD.I. 21-23; D.I. 21-24; D.I. 21-25; D.I. 21-26; D.I. 21-27; D.I. 21-28; D.I. 21-29). \nAccordingly, I will unseal these exhibits. \nSalesforce's remaining exhibits consist of a settlement agreement (D.1. 21-5) \nand seven LLC operating agreements (D.I. 21-12; D.I. 21-13; D.I. 21-14; D.I. 21-\n15; D.I. 21-16; D.I. 21-18; D.I. 21-19). These documents lie at the heart of the \nparties' dispute before me. No good cause exists to seal these documents in their \nentirety, but good cause exists to seal bank account and taxpayer identification \ninformation contained in the documents and good cause may exist to maintain \nunder seal certain dollar amounts (but not ownership percentages). Accordingly, I \nwill give the parties ten days to submit proposed redactions to these exhibits. \n3 Finally, no good cause exists to seal WSOU's disclosure statement (D.I. 18), \nwhich merely identifies-but only partially-the real parties behind WSOU. \nThe District Court is not a star chamber. We are a public institution in a \ndemocratic republic and the public has a right of access to our filings and \nproceedings. That right is founded in the common law and \"antedates the \nConstitution.\" Bank of Am. Nat'/ Tr. & Sav. Ass 'n v. Hotel Rittenhouse Assocs., \n800 F.2d 339, 343 (3d Cir. 1986). The public's right of access is not absolute; but \nit is strongly presumed, and it can be overcome only if a party demonstrates that \npublic disclosure of a filing will result in \"a clearly defined and serious injury.\" In \nre Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prod. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662,672 (3d Cir. \n2019). Public disclosure that an individual has an ownership interest in an entity \ncreated by a state cannot be said to constitute an injury. Corporations and LLCs \nmay offer individuals protection from liability, but they don't entitle individuals to \nanonymity in court proceedings. \"The people have a right to know who is using \ntheir courts.\" Doe v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wis., 112 F.3d 869, 872 \n(7th Cir. 1997) (Posner, J.). \nNow therefore, at Wilmington on this Twenty-fourth day of February in \n2023, it is HEREBY ORDERED that: \n4 1. WSOU's Motion for Leave to File under Seal (D.1. 15) is \nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; \n2. The Clerk of the Court is directed to unseal D.I. 3; D.I. 16; D.I. \n17-1; D.I. 17-2; D.I. 17-3; D.I. 17-4; D.I. 17-5; D.I. 17-6; D.I. 17-7; D.I. \n17-8; D.I. 17-9; D.I. 17-11; D.I. 17-12; D.I. 17-13; D.I. 18; D.I. 20; D.I. \n21-1; D.I. 21-2; D.I. 21-3; D.I. 21-4; D.I. 21-7; D.I. 21-8; D.I. 21-9; D.I. \n21-10; D.I. 21-11; D.I. 21-17; D.I. 21-20; D.I. 21-21; D.I. 21-22; D.I. 21-\n23; D.I. 21-24; D.I. 21-25; D.I. 21-26; D.I. 21-27; D.I. 21-28; and D.I. \n21-29; and \n3. The parties shall submit no later than March 6, 2023, proposed \npublic versions ofD.I. 21-5; D.I. 21-12; D.I. 21-13; D.I. 21-14; D.I. 21-\n15; D.I. 21-16; D.I. 21-18; and D.I. 21-19. \nChief Judge \n5 "}
