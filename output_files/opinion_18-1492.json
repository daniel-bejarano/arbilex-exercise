No. 18-1492-CFC-SRF\nB & G MACHINE, INC.,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION!\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPresently before the court in this age discrimination action is a motion for summary\njudgment filed by Defendant B & G Machine, Inc. (\u201cB&G\u201d). (D.I. 86) For the following\nreasons, Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\na. Procedural History\n\nOn June 29, 2018, Plaintiff, John Bianchi, commenced this action against B&G in the\nSuperior Court of Washington, asserting claims arising from the termination of his employment.\n(DI. 1, Ex. 1) On July 18, 2018, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Washington by Defendant, B&G, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1441, and\n\n1446. (DI. 1) On July 25, 2018, B&G filed a motion to transfer venue. (D.I. 7) On September\n\n' The parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge for disposition of Defendant\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment. (D.I. 78)\n\n2 Defendant is sued as \u201cB & G Machine, Inc. a Washington corporation doing business as H-E\nParts International, Engine Solutions.\u201d (D.I. 1; D.I. 2)\n\n3 The briefing for the pending motion is as follows: Defendant\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 87),\nPlaintiff's answering brief (D.I. 92), and Defendant\u2019s reply brief (D.I. 93).\n11, 2018, the Western District of Washington granted B&G\u2019s motion to transfer venue and\ndirected that the case be transferred to this court. (D.I. 15)\n\nOn February 22, 2019, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. (D.I. 33) On March 8,\n2019, B&G filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings that was rendered moot by Plaintiff's\nfiling of a second amended complaint (the \u201cSAC\u201d) on March 29, 2019. (D.I. 35; D.I. 39; D.I.\n41) On April 12, 2019, B&G responded with another motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n(D.I. 44) The court recommended denying B&G\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on\nDecember 10, 2019. (D.I. 61) No objections were taken, and the Report and Recommendation\nwas adopted. (D.I. 62)\n\nOn January 14, 2022, B&G filed the present motion for summary judgment. (D.I. 86)\nFollowing completion of briefing, oral argument was held on June 1, 2022.\n\nb. Factual Background\n\nThis case arises out of the alleged termination of Plaintiff's employment in violation of\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634, and\nWashington\u2019s Law Against Age Discrimination (\u201cWLAD\u201d), Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 49.60.010-\n510.4 (DI. 41 at FJ 30-36)\n\nPlaintiff was 73 years old when he was terminated from his employment on February 28,\n2018. (Ud. at Ff 5-6; D.I. 92, Ex. G) Plaintiff was a \u201cpart-owner\u201d of B&G, a Washington based\nbusiness, until he entered into a stock purchase agreement with H-E Parts International on\nAugust 13, 2013, wherein Plaintiff sold all of his shares in the company in exchange for an initial\n\npayment of $10,117,493, and additional payments as determined in the post-transaction earn-out\n\n4 Plaintiff concedes in his answering brief that he cannot prevail on his Washington State law\nclaim because Washington does not recognize the direct evidence theory applied under federal\nlaw in proving age discrimination. See, discussion in Section IV, infra; (D.I. 92 at 1 n.1)\nperiod. (D.I. 41 at 8; D.I. 87 at 5, Ex. A at 15:7-16:13, Ex. B at 10:9-12, 13:15-22) In\naddition, Plaintiff and Defendant executed a three-year employment contract wherein Plaintiff\ncontinued working for B&G as President. (D.I. 87, Ex A at 17:17-18:14) Hitachi subsequently\npurchased H-E Parts in December 2016. (D.I. 92, Ex. J. at 22:22-23:6)\n\nOn May 20, 2015, Defendant\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Mike Coffey, wrote an email to\nPlaintiff, stating that the company wanted to ensure that the long-term leadership at B&G had\n\u201csome runway behind them when we sell the company.\u201d (D.I. 41 at 4 9; D.I. 92, Ex. A) Coffey\nalso stated in May 2015 that it was important to identify both the founder and the \u201cnew blood\u201d to\npotential buyers. (D.I. 41 at \u00a2 11; D.I. 92, Ex. B) Plaintiff asserts that he took contemporaneous\nnotes of this conversation. (D.I. 92 at 2, Ex.B) On July 1, 2015, the role of President\ntransitioned from Plaintiff to his son, David Bianchi, as part of Defendant\u2019s succession planning.\n(DL 41 at \u00a7 13; D.L. 87, Ex. C; D.I. 92, Ex. I at 23:16-24:15) Thereafter, Defendant changed\nPlaintiff's job description from President to Technical Advisor to the President. (/d.)\n\nIn August 2016, the three-year term expired for Plaintiff's employment, but he continued\nto work without a contract in his position as Technical Advisor. (D.I. 41 at 14; D.I. 92, Ex. I at\n85:10-23) On April 19, 2017, Plaintiff indicated that he wished to continue working and\ninquired whether his age was a factor in his continued employment. (D.I. 41 at J 15; D.I. 92, Ex.\nC) Coffey responded that \u201call companies need new blood,\u201d but that Plaintiff would be employed\nas long as he was healthy and performing. (D.I. 41 at ff 15-16; D.I. 92, Ex. C) On April 20,\n2017, Coffey emailed Plaintiff and referenced a proposed two-year contract extension on\nPlaintiff's employment with the Defendant. (D.I. 41 at { 17; D.I. 92, Ex. D)\n\nIn September 2017, Coffey informed David Bianchi that he intended to terminate\n\nPlaintiff because of an incident involving a former co-employee. (D.I. 41 at 7 19; D.I. 92, Ex. E)\nHowever, it was not until January 31, 2018, when Coffey informed Plaintiff that he was\nterminated effective February 28, 2018. (D.I. 41 at \u00a7 20; D.I. 92, Ex. G) When Plaintiff\nresponded that he wished to remain employed, Coffey stated that his \u201chistory and reputation cast\na large shadow and the business needs for Eric, Bill and the Seattle team to gain their footing.\u201d\n(D.I. 41 at J 20; D.I. 92, Ex. F)\u00b0 Plaintiff's two sons, David and Johnny Bianchi, who are\napproximately twenty to thirty years younger than Plaintiff, remained employed with Defendant.\n(D.L. 41 at \u00a7 21; D.I. 92, Ex. H)\n\nAround the time of Plaintiffs termination, Defendant hired Eric Lentz, who was\napproximately 39 years old. (D.I. 41 at \u00a7 22; D.I. 92, Ex. I at 35:21-36:2) Plaintiff alleges in the\nSAC that Lentz \u201creplaced Plaintiff at Defendant for all intents and purposes.\u201d (D.I. 41 at \u00a7 22)\nHowever, Plaintiff testified in his deposition that Lentz did not replace him. (D.I. 87, Ex. A at\n35:3-36:6)\u00b0 On February 2, 2018, Coffey informed Plaintiff\u2019s sons that they were a critical part\nof Defendant\u2019s future and that it was time to move on from Plaintiffs termination. (D.I. 41 at J\n23; D.I. 87, Ex. I) On March 1, 2018, Plaintiff alleges that Coffey informed several Defendant\nemployees that Plaintiff's termination was by agreement. (D.I. 41 at 24; D.I. 87, Ex. I) On\nMarch 28, 2018, Coffey informed Plaintiff that he had been terminated due to the results of a\n\ndiligence assessment that indicated that former owners should be transitioned out to allow new\n\n5 H-E Parts had acquired various companies which merged into a large organization leading to\nelimination of the President positions within the acquired companies and replacement with\nGeneral Manager positions with one overarching role termed the \u201cPresident of all North\nAmerica.\u201d (D.I. 87, Ex. A at 25:5-26:3, Ex. F at 29:16-31:16) The President\u2019s role was assigned\nto Bill Brown. (/d., Ex. A at 25:20-26:3)\n6 The Plaintiff's testimony is as follows:\n\nQ. \u201cAnd do you believe that Eric Lentz was hired and he replaced David.\u201d\n\nA. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\nQ. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that Eric Lentz replaced you, do you?\u201d\n\nA. \u201cNo. Eric didn\u2019t have any experience in engines or machining, and you really need to\n\nhave that experience in order to run a company like that.\u201d (D.I. 87, Ex. A at 35:13-20)\nmanagement an opportunity for success. (D.I. 41 at \u00a5 25; D.I. 92, Ex. H) Plaintiff alleges that he\nwas healthy, performed well, and was an asset to Defendant at all relevant times. (D.I. 41 at J\n27; D.I. 92, Ex. I at 27:11-13) However, Plaintiff alleges that Coffey consistently made\nrepresentations that there needed to be \u201cnew blood\u201d and \u201cnew ideas\u201d in management and a\npotential for new growth. (D.I. 41 at \u00a7 29; D.I. 92, Ex. A-C)\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely\ndisputed material fact relative to the claims in question. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n330 (1986). Material facts are those \u201cthat could affect the outcome\u201d of the proceeding, and \u201ca\ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury\nto return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.\n2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). The burden on the\nmoving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of\nevidence supporting the non-moving party\u2019s case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.\n\nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue\nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986);\nWilliams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving\nparty asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \u201c(A) citing to\nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored\ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations . . ., admissions, interrogatory answers, or\n\nother materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish\nthe absence .. . of a genuine dispute. ...\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). If the non-moving party fails\nto make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to which it has the\nburden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477\n\nUS. at 322.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Plaintiffs opposition to Defendant\u2019s motion turns on whether there is direct evidence\nupon which the trier of fact could reasonably find that Plaintiff was terminated from employment\non the basis of his age. (D.J. 92) The court does not apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-\nshifting analysis when a plaintiff sets forth a disparate treatment claim based on direct evidence.\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973); see Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.\nThurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121 (1985) (holding that \u201cthe McDonnell Douglas test is inapplicable\nwhere the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination\u201d). Rather, the court applies the test\nset forth in Price Waterhouse\u2019 that \u201conce direct evidence of age discrimination is presented the\n\u201cburden of persuasion on the issue of causation shifts, and the employer must prove that it would\nhave fired the plaintiff even if it had not considered... [his] age.\u2019\u201d Glanzman v. Metro. Mgmt.\nCorp., 391 F.3d 506, 512 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Fakete v. Aetna, 308 F.3d 335, 338 (3d. Cir.\n2002)); see Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 240-242 (1989). Direct evidence of age\ndiscrimination is \u201cevidence sufficient to allow the jury to find that the decision makers placed a\nsubstantial negative reliance on [the plaintiffs age] in reaching their decision.\u201d Fakete, 308 F.3d\nat 338. Plaintiff \u201cmust produce evidence of discriminatory attitudes about age that were causally\n\nrelated to the decision to fire\u201d him. Glanzman, 391 F.3d at 512.\n\n7 Congress overruled this test as applied in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, however, that Act does\nnot apply to ADEA and \u201cwe continue to apply the Price Waterhouse test in order to resolve\nADEA cases.\u201d Glanzman, 391 F.3d at 512 n.3.\nPlaintiff advocates the direct evidence theory because he concedes that he cannot prevail\nunder the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting theory,\u2019 which first requires the Plaintiff to\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADEA. See McDonnell Douglas Corp.,\n411 U.S. at 802. To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, Plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that: \u201c(1) the plaintiff was a member of the protected age class; (2) he suffered an\nadverse employment decision; (3) he was qualified to hold the position; and (4) he was replaced\nby a significantly younger employee.\u201d Id.; see Willis v. UPMC Children\u2019s Hosp. of Pittsburgh,\n808 F.3d 638, 644 (3d Cir. 2015). Plaintiff cannot satisfy the fourth prong, as he testified in his\ndeposition that he was not replaced by Lentz and to his knowledge had not been replaced by\nanyone. (D.I. 87, Ex. A at 35:3-36:6)\n\nPlaintiff argues that there is a material issue of fact as to the Defendant\u2019s motivation for\nhis termination based upon \u201cdirect, uncontested ageist statements.\u201d (D.I. 92 at 8) Plaintiff points\nto the Defendant\u2019s statements he contends are \u201cdirect\u201d evidence despite the lack of any case\nauthority treating such statements as direct evidence. These statements include: (1) Coffey\u2019s\nMay 20, 2015 statement, \u201cOur motivations haven\u2019t changed. We want to make certain long term\nleadership at B&G...has some runway behind them when we sell the company...\u201d (/d. at 7; Ex.\nA); (2) Coffey\u2019s May 2015 statement that it was important to say to potential buyers, \u201cHere is the\n\nfounder over here. Now, here is the new blood, new ideas, potential for growth\u201d (/d. at 7, Ex. B;\n\n8 Plaintiff acknowledged at oral argument that he could not prevail on the burden-shifting theory\nunder McDonnell Douglas. (6/1/2022 Tr. at 19:22-20:3)\n\n9 Tf the Plaintiff meets his prima facie burden, \u201cthe burden then must shift to the employer to\narticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s\u201d adverse employment\naction. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802; see Hodczak v. Latrobe Specialty Steel Co.,\n451 F. App\u2019x 238, 240 (3d Cir. 2011). If the employer satisfies its burden, \u201cthe burden of\nproduction shifts back to [Plaintiff] to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s proffered rationale was a\npretext for age discrimination.\u201d Jd.\nD.L. 87, Ex. I at J 3); and (3) Coffey\u2019s April 19, 2017 statement that \u201call companies need new\nblood\u201d in response to Plaintiff questioning whether his age was a factor in keeping his job. (D.I.\n92 at 8, Ex. C, Ex. J at 35:22-25; D.I. 87, Ex. lat ]3) Defendant argues that such statements do\nnot on their face relate to age. (D.I. 87 at 7-8, D.I. 93 at 2-3) Defendant argues that these\nstatements are instead \u201cstray, ambiguous, general remarks\u201d which cannot defeat summary\njudgment. (D.I. 93 at 2-3, quoting MacDonald v. Swedish Health Servs., 1996 WL 366604, at *2\n(9th Cir. July 1, 1996)).\n\nPlaintiff also lists a variety of rationales supplied by Defendant for Plaintiff's\ntermination, all of which have nothing to do with age discrimination, for example: it needed a\nformer owner removed; it conducted a diligence assessment of management; it was eliminating\nPlaintiff's position; it was restructuring management; and Plaintiff's termination was by\nagreement. (D.I. 92 at 7) Plaintiff argues Defendant\u2019s reasons for his termination are evidence\nof a plan of several years in the making to end Plaintiff's employment with Defendant. (Jd. at 3-\n4, 7-8) However, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate how these justifications support a claim of age\ndiscrimination. See Fakete, 308 F.3d at 339 (evidence must \u201cfairly be said to directly reflect the\nalleged unlawful basis for the adverse employment decision\u201d). On their face, the listed reasons\ncomport with the business restructuring goals of the Defendant.\n\nMoreover, \u201ccomments that do not relate to age on their face cannot by their very nature\nconstitute direct evidence of age discrimination.\u201d Holshue v. Fanelli Window Pros., Inc., 2006\nWL 680878, at *3 (M.D. Pa. March 16, 2006) (quoting Sosky v. Int\u2019l Mill Serv., Inc., 1996 WL\n32139, at *4 (ED. Pa. Jan. 25, 1996)). Coffey\u2019s statement indicating his desire for new\nmanagement to gain \u201csome runway\u201d prior to selling the company does not on its face relate to\n\nage. Likewise, \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018new blood\u2019 does not on its face relate to age.\u201d Holshue, 2006 WL\n680878, at *3 (emphasis in original) (finding that the phrase \u201cnew blood\u201d is \u201cat best weak\ncircumstantial evidence of age discrimination\u201d); see Hodczak v. Latrobe Specialty Steel Co., 761\nF. Supp. 2d 261, 271 (W.D. Pa. 2010), aff'd, 451 F. App\u2019x 238 (3d Cir. 2011) (noting that\nemployer wanting \u201cnew blood\u201d was \u201cnot necessarily the equivalent of \u2018young\u2019 blood\u201d); see also\nMacDonald, 1996 WL 366604, at *2 (\u201cA desire to revitalize the organization with \u2018new blood\u2019 is\nnot by itself synonymous with age discrimination\u201d and \u201c[t]aken literally, these words suggest\nthat the [employer] wanted to consider outside applicants, both young and old\u201d).\n\nIn Hodczak, the plaintiffs, who were under investigation for violating their employer\u2019s\nethical conduct policy, argued their terminations were based on a corporate culture of age bias.\nHodczak, 451 F. App\u2019x at 241. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment\nfor plaintiffs\u2019 employer, finding that the following incidents were temporally remote and not\nprobative of age discrimination: (1) the CEO stating \u201cit looks like you are ready to retire. You\nhave gray hair and are fat\u201d after asking whether the employee was ready to retire; (2) an\nemployee being transferred to a different position because the company wanted \u201cnew blood\u201d in\nthe department; (3) the CEO mentioning the need to recruit a \u201cyounger workforce\u201d during a\nmeeting; and (4) older supervisors sitting at one end of the table during meetings and being\nroutinely interrupted when speaking while management welcomed the advice of younger\nemployees. Jd. The court ruled that \u201c[w]hen considering whether remarks are probative of\ndiscrimination, we consider the speaker\u2019s position in the organization, the content and purpose of\nthe statement, and the temporal connection between the statement and the challenged\nemployment action.\u201d Id. The court found the statements qualified as \u201cstray remarks. ..entitled to\nminimal weight.\u201d Jd. Plaintiff concedes that the statements in the instant case are less\n\ninflammatory than the comments in Hodczak. (6/1/2022 Tr. at 20:25-22:5)\nAs in Hodczak, Coffey\u2019s statements in the instant case are stray remarks entitled to\nminimal weight. They are temporally remote from the decision to terminate Plaintiff. See Sosky,\n1996 WL 32139, at *4 (finding that various alleged ageist comments made months prior to the\nplaintiffs termination were \u201ctoo stray and too remote from the decision to eliminate plaintiff s\nposition as to constitute direct evidence of age discrimination\u201d). Coffey\u2019s \u201crunway behind them\u201d\nand \u201cnew blood\u201d comments in May of 2015, were made nearly three years prior to Plaintiff's\ntermination. Coffey\u2019s April 19, 2017, \u201cnew blood\u201d comment predates Plaintiffs termination by\nat least ten months and was immediately followed the next day by an offer of a two-year contract\nextension on Plaintiff's employment with the Defendant. (D.I. 92, Ex. D) This offer is\ninconsistent with a plan to terminate Plaintiff based on his age.\n\nI. CONCLUSION\n\nBased upon the foregoing reasons, there is no issue of material fact such that a reasonable\n\njury could find that Plaintiff would not have been fired but for his age. Therefore, Defendant\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment is granted.
