THOMPSON, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nM. Denise Tolliver, Camden, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nJohn E. Tarburton, Esquire, Orlans PC, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendant\nMelanie J. Thompson.\n\nChristina J. Pross, Esquire, Marinosci Law Group, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for\nDefendant Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nAugust 4 , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nANDREWS, & District Judge:\n\nPlaintiff M. Denise Tolliver appears pro se. She commenced this lawsuit on\nDecember 17, 2021 and alleges violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u2019), the\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\u2019), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act\n(\u201cECOA\u2019), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982, breach of contract, and violation of the duty of good faith\nand fair dealing. (D.I. 1). Before the Court are Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and\nmotions to strike and Plaintiffs motion for default judgment and motion to quash. (D.1.\n6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16). The motions have been fully briefed.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs complaint makes the following allegations. Plaintiff entered into a trial\nmortgage payment plan that began on July 24, 2020. (D.I. 1 at 2). On October 7,\n2020, Defendant Rushmore Loan Management Services, which | infer is her loan\nservicer (accord, D.|. 7 at 1), knowingly provided inaccurate data to TransUnion when\nRushmore did not report Plaintiff's trial payment plan. (/d. at2). Rushmore \u201cwillfully\nprovided\u201d Plaintiff \u201ca predated February 17, 2021 Permanent Modification Agreement\n(\u2018MOD\u2019) with an expired date to respond by and... with an unaffordable\u201d monthly\nmortgage payment when she had been promised an affordable mortgage payment.\n(id.). Rushmore denied additional requests for mortgage assistance on May 19, 2021\nand July 26, 2021. (/d.). Rushmore has not provided an \u201cunbiased accounting\u201d of her\npayments during the trial payment plan period from July 2020 to September 2021.\n(Id.).\n\nCount One alleges that Rushmore violated the FDCPA under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1692f(a)(1) and the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n and/or \u00a7 16810, to when it willfully failed\n\n1\n\nto comply with the requirements imposed under both acts. She was damaged by a\ndrop in her credit score and denied refinancing of her auto because of the inaccurate\ncredit reporting. (/d. at 3).\n\nCount Two is raised against Rushmore and Defendant Melanie J. Thompson, an\nattorney at Orlans, PC. (/d. at 2, 3). It alleges that Defendants willfully violated the\nrequirements of the ECOA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 when Plaintiff saw\nThompson engage \u201cin [a] pattern and practice based on race whereby almost\nexclusively client/participants were Black and Brown people while others in a similar\ncapacity as to Defendant, were observed to have diverse clients.\u201d (/d. at 3). Both\nDefendants \u201cmade decisions adverse to Plaintiff because of her sex,\u201d identifying her as\nan unmarried woman. (/d.).\n\nCount Three is raised against both Defendants and alleges breach of contract\n\nand breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law\nwhen Plaintiff entered into the trial payment plan on July 24, 2020, made all payments\nas required and Rushmore then provided \u201can \u2018unenforceable\u2019 MOD predated February\n17, 2021 that was issued past the date for Plaintiff to respond in 15 days,\u201d and, after\nPlaintiff retained counsel, several months later and at great expense, Rushmore\nexecuted the modification agreement unchanged on September 23, 2021. (/d. at 4).\nPlaintiff seeks statutory, actual, and punitive damages. (/d.). Defendants move\nto dismiss.\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b6)(6), the Court must accept\nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to\n\n2\nplaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds\npro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her complaint, \u201chowever inartfully\npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by\nlawyers.\u201d Id. A court may consider the pleadings, public record, orders, exhibits\nattached to the complaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.\nTellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Lid., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). A Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion maybe granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as\ntrue and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Ail. Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n\n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of\na cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014)\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). | am \u201cnot required to credit bald assertions or\nlegal conclusions improperly alleged in the complaint.\u201d /n re Rockefeller Ctr. Props.,\nInc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed,\nhowever, \u201cfor imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\u201d\nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014).\n\nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \u201csubstantive\nplausibility.\u201d That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the [complainant]\npleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n[accused] is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d /d. Deciding whether a claim is\n\n3\n\nplausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its\njudicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d. at 679.\nlil. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 ef seq.\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692, et seq.\n\nRushmore moves to dismiss Count One for failure to state claims upon which\nrelief can be granted. It notes that Plaintiff does not cite to any section or law that was\nviolated and fails to provide any argument or factual basis that the FCRA or FDCPA\nwere violated. (D.I. 12 at 1-3). Plaintiff responds that Rushmore \u201cacted willfully and\nunlawfully\u201d because her \u201c\u2018direct dispute\u201d and \u201cTrial Modification\u201d were never reported\nto TransUnion.\n\nThe Complaint invokes 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n; and/or 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7 16810 in an attempt to assert a claim under the FCRA and the FDCPA. 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(a)(1) does not exist. Probably, Plaintiff is referring to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1692f(1), which generally prohibits debt collectors from using unfair practices to collect\ndebts. Sections 1681n and 16810 of the FCRA refer to civil liability for willful\nnoncompliance and to civil liability for negligent noncompliance, respectively. The\nComplaint alleges that Rushmore willfully failed to comply with the requirements of the\nFCRA and the FDCPA and that inaccurate credit reporting damaged Plaintiffs credit\nscore.\n\nThe FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from making false, deceptive, or\nmisleading representations to collect a debt. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e). \u201cA claim under\nthe FDCPA \u2018may be brought . . . within one year from the date on which the violation\n\noccurs.\u201d Glover v. F.D.I.C., 698 F.3d 139, 148 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\n4\n\n1692k(d)). In the context of FDCPA claims, \u201ccommunications from lenders to debtors\n[are analyzed] from the perspective of the \u2018least sophisticated debtor.\u2019\u201d Lesher v. Law\nOffices of Mitchell N. Kay, PC, 650 F.3d 993, 997 (3d Cir. 2011).\n\nPlaintiffs claim under the FDCPA does not allege Rushmore engaged in unlawful\npractices to collect a debt from Plaintiff. Instead, Count One refers to providing\ninaccurate data to TransUnion, which is not a claim that states a cause of action under\nthe FDCPA. If it were a claim, it would be time-barred. She alleges it occurred on\nOctober 7, 2020. She filed this suit on December 17, 2021, more than two months\nafter the statute of limitations would have run.\n\nWith respect to the FCRA, the statute was enacted \"to ensure fair and accurate\ncredit reporting, promote efficiency in the banking system, and protect consumer\nprivacy.\u201d Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 52 (2007). Stated slightly\ndifferently, the FCRA is intended \u201cto protect consumers from the transmission of\ninaccurate information about them, and to establish credit reporting practices that utilize\naccurate, relevant and current information in a confidential and responsible manner.\u201d\nSimmsParris v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 652 F.3d 355, 357 (3d Cir. 2011). To state a\nclaim under the FCRA against a furnisher of credit information, as opposed to the credit\nreporting agency itself, a plaintiff must allege that \u201c[s]he filed a notice of dispute with a\nconsumer reporting agency; the consumer reporting agency notified the furnisher of\ninformation of the dispute; and the furnisher of information failed to investigate and\nmodify the inaccurate information.\u201d Harris v. Pa. Higher Educ. Assistance Agency/Am.\nEduc. Servs., 2016 WL 3473347, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June 24, 2016); see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n1681s-2(b), 1681n , and 16810. The Complaint does not contain any allegations that\n\n5\n\nPlaintiff filed a notice of dispute regarding the alleged inaccurate data, and it thus fails to\nstate a claim.\n\nCount One of the Complaint does not adequately plead claims under either the\nFDCPA or the FCRA. There is no possibility that an amended complaint could plead a\nFDCPA violation within the statute of limitations, but it is at least possible that Plaintiff\ncould do so in regard to the FCRA. Therefore, the Court will grant Rushmore\u2019s motion\nto dismiss Count I, but with leave to amend.\n\nB. Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691, et seq.\n\nDefendants move to dismiss the ECOA claims raised in Count Two for failure to\nstate claims upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff alleges in a conclusory manner\nthat Thompson is a creditor as defined by ECOA. The Complaint notes that Thompson\ncan be reached at \u201cOrlans, PC, Attention: Melanie J. Thompson, Esq.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 2).\nConversely, Thompson argues that she is not a creditor; she is an attorney for Orlans\nPC, a law firm that represents mortgage lenders and servicers in the State of Delaware,\nand Plaintiffs claims relate to Thompson\u2019s representation of Rushmore in connection\nwith a mortgage on Plaintiffs home. (D.I. 7 at 5). In turn, Plaintiff argues that\nThompson \u201ccannot avoid liability on the grounds that she is not a debt collector and/or\ncreditor,\u201d and \u201cThompson is not exempt from compliance with federal law.\u201d (D.I. 10 at\n3). Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendants made decisions adverse to her because of\nher sex.\n\nUnder the ECOA, a creditor may not discriminate against any applicant on the\n\u201cbasis of race, color, .. ., sex or marital status.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(a). To state a claim\nunder the ECOA, a plaintiff \u201cmust [allege] that (1) plaintiff was a member of a protected\n\n6\nclass; (2) plaintiff applied for credit from the defendants; (3) plaintiff was qualified for the\ncredit; and (4) despite qualification, plaintiff was denied credit.\u201d Chiang v. Veneman, 385\nF.3d 256, 259 (3d Cir. 2004) Anderson v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., 621 F.3d 261, 268 n.\n5 (3d Cir. 2010) (cleaned up). A plaintiff may support an assertion of discrimination by\nshowing that the defendant \u201chas treated more favorably similarly situated persons not\nwithin the protected class.\u201d Jones v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 198 F.3d 403, 413 (3d\nCir. 1999).\n\nHere, Plaintiff alleges that decisions were made based upon her sex and\nsuggests race discrimination. (D.I. 1 at 3). The allegations are conclusory and\ninsufficient to show that other similarly situated persons who are not members of a\nprotected class were treated more favorably when they applied for a loan modification.\nSee Stefanowicz v. SunTrust Mortgage, 765 F. App'x 766, 772 (3d Cir. 2019).\n\nIn addition, Thompson, as an attorney, does not meet the definition of a creditor.\nSee Riethman v. Berry, 287 F.3d 274, 277 (3d Cir. 2002) (law firm was not a \u201ccreditor\u201d\nsubject to the ECOA); Lewis v. ACB Business Services, inc., 135 F.3d 389, 408 (6th\nCir. 1998) (attorney who represented creditor and debt collector acting on creditor's\nbehalf was not \u201ccreditor\u201d within meaning of ECOA).\n\nAccordingly, Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss this claim will be granted. Plaintiff\nwill be given leave to amend the claim against Rushmore.\n\nC. 420U,S.C. \u00a7 1982\n\nDefendants move to dismiss the \u00a7 1982 claim in Count Two for failure to state\nclaims upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff argues that she has adequately\n\nalleged a \u00a7 1982 claim.\n\nCount Two alleges that Defendants willfully violated \u00a7 1982 when Plaintiff saw\nThompson at mediation events engaging in a pattern and practice based on race\nbecause Thompson's clients/participants were \u201cBlack and Brown people\u201d while others in\na similar capacity to Thompson had \u201cdiverse clients.\u201d She also alleges that adverse\ndecisions were made based upon her sex.\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 provides, \u201cAll citizens of the United States shall have the same\nright, in every state and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit,\npurchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\u201d The scope of a \u00a7\n1982 claim is limited to cases of intentional race discrimination. See Shaare Tefila\nCongregation v. Cobb, 481 U.S. 615, 617 (1987). To state a claim under \u00a7 1982,\nPlaintiff must allege that (1) she is a member of a racial minority; (2) she applied for and\nwas qualified to rent or purchase certain property or housing; (3) she was rejected\nbecause of her race; and (4) the opportunity to purchase or rent remained open. See\nChauhan v. M. Alfieri Co., 707 F. Supp. 162, 165 (D.N.J.1988) (citing cases), rev'd on\nother grounds, 897 F.2d 123 (3d Cir.1990); Gregory v. Hasara, 1991 WL 53671, at *2\n(E.D. Pa. Apr. 3, 1991).\n\nThe allegations in the Complaint fail to establish a prima facie case under \u00a7\n1982. The allegations refer to a mortgage modification agreement and that Plaintiff\nwas provided an opportunity to modify her mortgage payments. To the extent Plaintiff\nalleges sex discrimination, no claim can be stated because the statute only applies to\nrace discrimination. To the extent Plaintiff alleges race discrimination, the claim\nnonetheless fails. As alleged, Defendants sought out minority clients. Plaintiff does not\nallege that she was denied the rental or purchase of any property.\n\n8\nAccordingly, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the claim.\nPlaintiff will be given leave to amend the claim.\nIV. BREACH OF CONTRACT\n\nBREACH OF THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR\n\nDEALING\n\nDefendants move to dismiss the supplemental claims raised in Count Three for\nfailure to state claims upon which relief can be granted. Count Three alleges breach of\ncontract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nTo state a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must allege (1) the existence of\na contract; (2) that a defendant breached an obligation imposed by the contract; and (3)\nthat Plaintiff incurred damages as a result of the breach. See VLIW Tech., LLC v.\nHewlett-Packard, Co., 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del. 2003). \u201cTo state a claim for breach of\nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, [a plaintiff] must allege (1) a specific\nimplied contractual obligation; (2) a breach of the obligation by the defendant; and (3)\nresulting damage to the plaintiff.\u201d O\u2019Neill v. AFS Holdings, LLC, 2014 WL 626031, at *4\n(Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 15, 2014) (quoting Fitzgerald v. Cantor, 1998 WL 842316, at * 1\n(Del. Ch. Nov. 10, 1998)). The implied covenant has a \u201cnarrow purpose\u201d and is \u201conly\nrarely invoked successfully.\u201d O\u2019Neill, 2014 WL 626031, at *4. It is a doctrine \u201cby which\nDelaware law cautiously supplies terms to fill gaps in the express provisions ofa\nspecific agreement.\u201d Allen v. El Paso Pipeline GP Co., LLC, 113 A.3d 167, 179-84 (Del.\nCh. 2014).\n\nCount Three is not adequately pled. The Complaint fails to allege the elements\nof a contract. For one thing it does not allege that Plaintiff had a contract with either\nDefendant. For another, assuming that the contract was the TPP, and that it was with\n\n9\n\nRushmore, Plaintiff does not state a provision, either express or implied, that was\nbreached. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend Count Three against Rushmore, since\nshe may be able to state a claim against it.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\n(D.I. 6, 11); (2) deny Plaintiffs motion for default judgment (D.I. 8) and motion to quash\n(D.I. 13); and (3) deny Rushmore\u2019s motions to strike (D.I. 15, 16). Plaintiff will be given\nleave to file an amended complaint.\n\nA separate order shall issue.\n\n10\n"}
