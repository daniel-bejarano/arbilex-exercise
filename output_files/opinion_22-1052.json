NEWMAN,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1052- RGA  \n      : THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION,  :        :   Defendant.    : \n \n Shantell  D. Newman , New Castle , Delaware .  Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n    December        , 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n ANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n Plaintiff  Shantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4).  She commenced this action on August 10, 2022.  \n(D.I. 2).  T he Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff  alleges that a truck transporting 100 monkeys to a \nCDC rese arch lab crashed on a Pennsylvania highway , the CDC \u201cissued killings for the \nmonkeys\u201d, everyone is at risk, and now we have money pox .  (D.I. 2 at 4 -5). \n Plaintiff seeks full disclosure under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611 \u201con how the monkeys were \nable to spread a virus.  ( Id. at 5).  She alleges Defendant has caused her friends pain, \nand she seeks 700 million  dollar s.  (Id. at 5, 7).  \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under t he screening  \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, h er 2 \n pleading is liberally construed and her  Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. at 94.   \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pur suant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)  and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims  for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71915, the C ourt must grant P laintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless amendment \nwould be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 F.3d 103, 114 \n(3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007) .  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id . at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, 3 \n because they are no more than conclusions, are not ent itled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -specific task that  requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \n Plain tiff cannot bring a private civil cause of action under  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611, a \ncriminal statute under the Truth in Lending Act.   Otto v. Wells Fargo Bank , N.A ., 693 F. \nApp\u2019x 161, 163- 64 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing  Vallies v. Sky Bank , 591 F.3d 152, 156 (3d Cir. \n2009) (distinguishing between the private cause of action under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640 and \nthe criminal liability imposed by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611 in describing the range of remedies \nunder the Truth in Lending Act ); see also, e.g., United States v. City of Phila delphia ., \n644 F.2d 187, 198- 99 (3d Cir. 1980).  \n In addition, Defendant  is immune from suit.   The Biden Administration is the \nexecutive branch of the United States government.  It is well established that an action \nagainst the United States cannot be maintained unless the United States waives its sovereign immunity.  United States v. Mitchell , 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980).  A waiver of \nsovereign immunity cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.  Id . (citing \nUnited States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4 (1969)).  \u201c It is axiomatic that the United States may \nnot be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for 4 \n jurisdiction. \u201d  United States v. Mitchell , 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983).   Accordingly, the \nComplaint will be dismissed.   \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (i) and (iii) .  Amendment is futile.  \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1052- RGA  \n      : THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION,  :        :   Defendant.    : \n \n \nORDER  \n \n At Wilmington this 14th day of  December , 2022 , for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \n IT IS ORDERED that:  \n1.
