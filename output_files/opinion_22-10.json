Counsel for Defendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nSeptember 28, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\n(LF G\n\nCONNOLLY, Chief Jadge:\n\nPlaintiff Michael Higgin, who appears pro se, filed this action on December\n10, 2021, in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle\nCounty, C.A. No. N21C-12-0064 MMJ. (D.I. 1-1 at 3-40) Defendant City of\nWilmington removed the matter to this Court on January 4, 2022. (DI. 1)\nCurrently pending is Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, opposed by Plaintiff. (D.1.\n5, 6, 10, 11)\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true\nfor purposes of deciding the pending motion. See Umland vy. PLANCO Fin.\nServs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). The Complaint contains six counts:\nCount 1, unlawful taking under the Fifth Amendment; Count 2, malicious\nprosecution; Count 3, racketeering; Count 4, nuisance; Count 5, negligence; and\nCount 6, libel.\n\nPlaintiff purchased the real property at issue in 2012. (DI. 1-lat6) He\nreceived a number of citations over an eight-year span and alleges that the\nharassing citations were unlawfully issued because they were for a strip of land\nthat he does not own. (/d.) Defendant charged Plaintiff $6,600 in civil penalty\n\ncharges. (Id. at 9)\nOn January 8, 2020, Defendant filed a writ of monition to recover water and\nsewer charges assessed and levied against the property from 2015 through 2019\nand civil penalties issued between April 23, 2013 through March 19, 2019. (DL.\n6-2 at 6); see Wilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at #1 (Del. Super.).! Plaintiff\nwas served by the posting of a statement of claim for Monition upon the property.\n(D.I. 6-2 at 6); Wilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at #3. A Sheriff's Sale was\nscheduled for October 13, 2020 and then stayed. (DI. 6-2 at 5); Wilmington v.\nHiggin, N20J-00088, at #6.\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Plaintiff received a notice of lienholder that the\nSheriff's Sale was scheduled for February 9, 2021. (DI. 6-2 at 5); Wilmington v.\nHiggin, N20J-00088, at #11. The sale was held and the property sold that day to\nthe high bidder. (D.I. 6-2 at 4; Wilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at #13.\nPlaintiff alleges that all taxes, water, and sewer charges were paid in full by the\ndate of the Sheriffs sale. (D.I. 1-1 at 9)\n\nOn March 8, 2021, Plaintiff redeemed the property prior to confirmation,\nand the upset bid collected at the sale was refunded to the high bidder. (DI. 1-1\n\nat 11; 6-2 at 4; Wilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at #13. Also, on March 8,\n\n' The Court takes judicial notice of the monitions proceeding and has reviewed the\nSuperior Court docket and all filings and orders entered in the case.\n3\n\n2021, Plaintiff filed a motion to stop the Sheriffs Sale which was denied when\nPlaintiff failed to appear for the hearing. (D.I. 6-2 at 3-4; Wilmington v. Higgin,\nN20J-00088, at #12, 16-19. Plaintiff sought a rehearing. (D.I. 6-2 at 3);\nWilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at#20 The request was granted and Plaintiff\nwas warned that if he failed to appear the Court would deny any request without\nfurther notice or opportunity to be heard. (D.I. 6-2 at 3); Wilmington v. Higgin,\nN20J-00088, at #21. Plaintiff received notice that the motion to re-hear his\nmotion to stay the Sheriff's sale was set for October 29, 2021. (D.I. 6-2 at 3);\nWilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at #22. On October 12, 2021, Plaintiff filed a\nnotice of motion to appeal the process of the Sheriff's sale and requested return of\nwages and damages. (D.I. 6-2 at 2); Wilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at #23.\nOn October 29, 2021, the Superior Court heard the motion to stay and the motion\nto appeal the Sheriff's Sale process. The motion to stay was denied. (D.I. 6-2 at\n2); Wilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at #26. In addition, the motion to appeal\nthe Sheriff\u2019s Sale process and for return of wages and damages was denied, and the\nCourt advised Plaintiff that he could utilize the appeal process provided by the City\nof Wilmington or file suit against the City of Wilmington. (DI. 6-2 at 2);\nWilmington v. Higgin, N20J-00088, at #25. He did not file an appeal in the\n\nmonitions proceeding.\n\nPlaintiff filed the instant case against Defendant on December 10, 2021.\nPlaintiff seeks injunctive relief to halt all Sheriff's sales as unconstitutional and\nfrom disconnecting his water services, as well as return of monetary property and\ncompensatory and punitive damages. (Jd. at 10-11)\n\nDefendant moves to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure\nto state claims upon which relief can be granted and based upon its immunity\nunder the Delaware Municipal Tort Claims Act. (D.I. 6)\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \u201ca\nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d\nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the\ncomplaint must include more than mere \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic\nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nUSS. 544, 555 (2007) (citation omitted). The complaint must set forth enough\nfacts, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Id.\nat 570. A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content\nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\nfor the misconduct alleged.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation\n\nomitted). Deciding whether a claim is plausible is a \u201ccontext-specific task that\nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d\nId. at 679 (citation omitted).\n\nWhen assessing the merits of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court\nmust accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and it must view those\nfacts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Umland, 542 F.3d at 64;\nSchmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014). \u201cIn deciding a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion, a court must consider only the complaint, exhibits attached to the\ncomplaint, matters of public record, as well as undisputed authentic documents if\nthe complainant\u2019s claims are based upon these documents.\u201d Mayer v. Belichick,\n605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir. 2010). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading\nis liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held\nto less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (citations omitted).\n\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Fifth Amendment Claim (Count 1)\n\nPlaintiff alleges an unconstitutional taking of property by Defendant in\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Such claims\n\nare properly brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\n\nA municipality may only be held liable under \u00a7 1983 when the \u201cexecution of\na government\u2019s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury.\u201d Andrews v. City of\nPhiladelphia, 895 F.2d 1469, 1480 (3d Cir. 1990). While a government policy is\nestablished by a \u201cdecisionmaker possessing final authority,\u201d a custom arises from a\n\u201ccourse of conduct. . . so permanent and well settled as to virtually constitute law.\u201d\nAndrews, 895 F.2d at 1480 (citing Monell v. Department of Social Services of the\nCity of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)). Accordingly, a plaintiff seeking to\nrecover from a municipality must (1) identify an allegedly unconstitutional policy\n\nor custom, (2) demonstrate that the municipality, through its deliberate and\n\nculpable conduct, was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the injury alleged; and (3)\ndemonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the alleged\ndeprivation of federal rights. Board of the County Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, 520 U.S.\n397, 404 (1997).\n\nThe \u00a7 1983 claim is raised in a conclusory manner without supporting facts.\n\nMore, it does not speak to an unconstitutional policy, ordinance, regulation of\n\ndecision officially adopted and promulgated by Defendant. At most it alleges that\n\u201cindividuals wh[ose] property is sold do[] not have the opportunity of due process\n\nto be heard prior to the sale\u201d and that Plaintiff \u201cfeels this is not a new practice for\n\nthe city.\u201d (D.I. 1-l at 1,4) This statement speaks to due process violations.\nEven were the Court to construe the claim as one arising under the\nFourteenth Amendment, see Brown v. Muhlenberg Twp., 269 F.3d 205 213 (3d\nCir. 2001), the claim fails. Any due process claim is contradicted by the\nMonitions proceeding, from which it is clear that due process was provided to\nPlaintiff. He received notice of the Monitions proceeding, he contested the\nSheriff\u2019s Sale and procedures, and following the Sheriffs sale he redeemed the\nproperty after it was sold to the highest bidder but before the sale was confirmed.\nWhile Plaintiff opted not to appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, he did opt to\nsue Defendant in the Superior Court.\n\nIn addition, the Complaint improperly alleges due process violations of the\nFifth Amendment. That Amendment applies to actions taken by the federal\ngovernment. Caldwell v. Beard, 324 F. App\u2019x 186, 189 (3d Cir. 2009). The\nclaim also fails under the Takings Clause under the Fifth Amendment as a matter\nof law, because Plaintiff retained a possessory interest in the property and\nexercised his right to redeem it following the Sheriffs sale and prior to\nconfirmation of the sale. See Munoz v. city of Union City, 481 F. App\u2019x 754 (3d\nCir 2012) (no taking where plaintiff retained possessory interest in property).\n\nIn short, the Complaint fails to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. Defendant\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss the claim will therefore be granted. Amendment is futile.\n\nC. Racketeering (Count 3)\n\nThe Complaint alleges in Count 3 that Defendant, \u201cas an enterprise is guilty\n\nof racketeering.\u201d (D.I. 1-1 at 12). To advance a civil claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1962(c) Plaintiff must allege \u201c(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern\n(4) of racketeering activity.\u201d Lum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir.\n2004) (citing Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U 8. 479 (1985)). A\n\u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d requires at least two \u201cpredicate acts,\u201d such as\nmail or wire fraud. /d.; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1),(5).\n\nThe racketeering claim is pled in a conclusory manner without the requisite\nsupporting facts. It also fails to allege predicate acts as required to state a RICO\nclaim. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the\nclaim. Amendment is futile.\n\nC. State Claims (Counts 2, 4 through 6)\n\nThe Complaint alleges malicious prosecution, nuisance, negligence, and\n\nlibel under Delaware law. Defendant seeks dismissal by reason of its immunity |\n\nfrom liability under the Delaware Municipal Tort Claims Act, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 4010, et\n\nseq.\n\nUnder Delaware\u2019s County and Municipal Tort Claims Act, \u201call\n\ngovernmental entities and their employees shall be immune from suit on any and\nall tort claims seeking recovery of damages.\u201d 10 Del. C. \u00a7 4011(a). The Act has\none narrow exception: \u201cAn employee may be personally liable for acts or\nomissions causing property damage, bodily injury or death in instances in which\nthe governmental entity is immune under this section, but only for those acts which\nwere not within the scope of employment or which were performed with wanton\nnegligence or wilful and malicious intent.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4011(c).\n\nThe Complaint does not allege facts from which it could be inferred that\nDefendant\u2019s actions meet the exceptions of the Act sufficient to impose liability.\nPlaintiff's claims are clearly barred by the Act and no exceptions apply. See\nHickman v. Castro, 2016 WL 3029922, at *6 (D. Del. May 26, 2016) (Act bars\nclaims of malicious prosecution and defamation); Davis v. Rinehart, 2014 WL\n4749192, at 5-6 (D. Del. Sept. 22, 2014) (Act bars negligence claim); Dale v. Town\nof Elsmere, 702 A.2d 1219, 1222 (Del 1997) (Act bars nuisance claim [i.e., a tort\nclaim seeking recovery of damages]); Carr v. Town of Dewey Beach, 730 F. Supp.\n591, 602 (D. Del. 1990) (economic damages do not constitute property damage for\nthe purposes of the Act); Dickerson v. Phillips, 2012 WL 2236709, at *2 (Del.\nSuper. Ct. June 13, 2012) (emotional distress and related injuries do not constitute\n\nbodily injury as defined by the Tort Claims Act under Delaware law).\n\n10\n\nPlaintiffs state claims are barred under Delaware\u2019s County and Municipal\nTort Claims Act. Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss these claims will\nbe granted. Amendment is futile.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will grant Defendant\u2019s motion to\ndismiss. (D.J.5) The Court finds that amendment of the Complaint is futile.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\n11\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nMICHAEL HIGGIN, )\n)\nPlaintiff, )\n)\nv. ) Civ.
