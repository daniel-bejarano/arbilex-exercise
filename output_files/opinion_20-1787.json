Tilley, KUTAK ROCK, LLP, \nDenver, CO. \nAttorneys for Defendants. \nNovember 15, 2022 \n1 Before me is Defendants' motion for leave to amend. (D.I. 89). The motion has been fully \nbriefed. (D.I. 90, 96, 97). For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion is DENIED. \nJ.. BACKGROUND \nOn June 2, 2021, Plaintiff Dr. Mark Barry filed his Complaint alleging infringement of \nU.S. Patent Nos. 7,670,358 (the \"'358 Patent\"), 8,361,121 (the \"'121 Patent\"), 9,339,301 (the \n\"'301 Patent\"), 9,668,787 (the \"'787 Patent\"), and 9,668,788 (the \"'788 Patent\") (collectively, the \n\"Asserted Patents\") against the Seaspine Defendants. (C.A. No. 21-806, D.I. 1). On March 21, \n2022, the present action was consolidated with Barry v. Stryker Corp., C.A. No. 20-1787. (D.I. \n43).,Toe deadline to amend the pleadings was June 3, 2022. (Id at 2). \nOn July 20, 2022, Defendants notified Plaintiff that they would seek leave to amend its \nanswer to assert a counterclaim and affirmative defense that the Asserted Patents are unenforceable \nbecause of Plaintiffs inequitable conduct. (D.I. 96, Ex. E). Plaintiff did not consent to the \namendment. (D.I. 89 at 3). Defendants filed the instant motion on August 19, 2022. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) states that, apart from amendments as a matter of \ncourse, \"a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the \ncourt's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\" FED. R. C1v. P. 15(a)(2). \nThe Third Circuit has instructed that \"absent undue or substantial prejudice, an amendment should \nbe allowed under Rule 15(a) unless 'denial [can] be grounded in bad faith or dilatory motive, truly \n' undue or unexplained delay, repeated failure to cure deficiency by amendments previously allowed\u00b7 \nor futility of amendment.\"' Long v. Wilson, 393 F.3d 390, 400 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Lundy v. \nAdamar of New Jersey, Inc., 34 F.3d 1173, 1196 (3d Cir. 1994)) (emphasis omitted). An \n2 amendment is futile if it \"would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\" In re \nBurlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997). The futility analysis \nfoilows the standard that applies to a motion under Rule 12(b)(6). Id. \nA request to amend filed after the court's deadline to amend must also meet the \"good \ncause\" standard of Rule 16(b)(4). Premier Comp Sols. v. UPMC, 970 F.3d 316,319 (3d Cir. 2020). \nRule 16(b)(4) provides, \"A schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge's \nconsent.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 16(b)(4). \"'Good cause' exists when the [s]chedule cannot reasonably be \nmet despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.\" ICU Med., Inc. v. Ry Med Techs., \nInc., 674 F. Supp. 2d 574, 577 (D. Del. 2009). Unlike Rule 15(a), the Rule 16(b) standard focuses \non the \"diligence of the movant, and not on prejudice to the non-moving party.\" Roquette Freres \nv. SPI Pharma, Inc., 2009 WL 1444835, at *4 (D. Del. May 21, 2009). \"A party must meet [Rule \n16(b)'s] standard before a district court considers whether the party also meets Rule 15(a)'s more \nliberal standard.\" Premier Comp, 970 F .3d at 319. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nThe Asserted Patents claim a method and system for aligning vertebrae that can be used in \nspinal surgeries. In their proposed amendment, Defendants allege that Plaintiff and his counsel \n\"made a series of knowing and intentional omissions and false statements over a course of several \nyears that establish a pattern and practice of deceptive intent rendering the Asserted Patents \nunenforceable.\" (D.I. 89, Ex. A at 26). For example, Defendants allege that Plaintiff failed to \ndisclose to the PTO surgeries that practiced the invention prior to the critical date of the patent, \nfailed to \"disclose material details of the surgery shown in Figure 6 of the '358 Patent,\" and \nsubmitted multiple certificates of correction to the PTO that contained materially false statements. \n3 (Id. at 55). Defendants no~ seek leave to amend their answer to add a counterclaim and affirmative \ndefense Jhat the Asserted Patents are unenforceable due to Plaintiff's inequitable conduct. \nA. RULE 16(b)(4) GOOD CAUSE \nDefendants argue there is good cause for leave to amend because they were diligent. \nDefendants state that they pieced together Plaintiff's alleged pattern of conduct through reviewing \n\"document production, prior case histories, deposition transcripts, patent file histories, and \nPlaintiff's prior admissions.\" (D.I. 90 at 1). Defendants claim to have relied upon prior la~suits, \nwhich also involved defendants alleging Plaintiff to have committed inequitable conduct. See, e.g., \nBarry v. Medtronic, Inc., C.A. No. 14-;104 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 4, 2014); Barry v. DePuy Synthes \nPrpducts, Inc., C.A. No. 17-3003-PD (E.D. Pa. July 5, 2017), consolidated with Barry v. Globus \nMedical, Inc., C.A. No. 17-2998-PD (E.D. Pa. July 5, 2017). Defendants also claim they learned \npertinent facts from reviewing the \"150,000 pages of documents\" Plaintiff produced in March \n' 2022. (D.I. 97 at 5;-6). Defendants argue they could not have met the deadline to amend due to the \nvoluminous record to review and the timing of document production. Defendants contend that the \n' time taken to\u00b7 investigate their \"theories and marshal \u25a1 the facts was necessary given that Rule 9(b) \nrequires that claims of inequitable conduct in patent cases be pied with particularity.\" (D .I. 90 at \n16). \nPlaintiff asserts Defendants cannot show good cause or diligence because Defendants \npossessed the information required to bring their inequitable conduct claim ahead of the deadline \nto amend. Plaintiff argues that the information Defendants relies on to support its claim of \ninequitable conduct is \"mostly, if not entirely, based on public material and allegations\" from prior \ncases, which Defendants could have obtained prior to the amendment deadline. (D.I. 96 at 9-10). \n4 Plaintiff also argues that Defendants cannot show_ diligenc~ because Defendants brought the \nmotion five months after they possessed the information necessary to bring the claim. \nI find that Defendants possessed the information that serves as the basis for their proposed \namendment in March 2022 when Plaintiff produced\" 150,000 pages of documents.\" (D.I. 96 at 12; \nD.I. 97 at 5-6). Defendants contend that'they relied on the March 2022 document production to \nuncover \"pertinent facts\" that were not public. (D.I. 97 at 5-6). Plaintiff argues the Medtronic and \nDePuy cases and Plaintiff's filings with the PTO were publicly available and accessible to \nDefendants much earlier. (D.I. 96 at 8). Even though these sources were accessible to Defendants \nprior to March 2022, I do not find Defendants lacked diligence for taking additional discovery to \n' confirm facts. See Roquette Freres v. SPI Pharma, Inc., 2009 WL 1444835, at *5 (D. Del. May \n21, 2009) (\"[I]n light of the pleading with particularity requirement under Rule 9(b ), it was \nappropriate for SPI to confirm the factual allegations through discovery.\"); see also Targus Int'! \nLLC v. Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., 2021 WL 2291978, at *3 (D. Del. June 4, 2021) (\"Victorinox \nwas reasonable in waiting to file this motion until after Targus had responded to discovery requests \n... espe_cially given the heightened standard of proof required for inequitable conduct claims.\"). \nTherefore, l find that Defendants possessed the requisite information to file their amendment in \nMarch 2022 and did not lack diligence in waiting for that production. \nI find, however, that Defendants cannot show good cause because they have not shown that \nthey could not meet the court's scheduling order despite their diligence. Defendants came into \npossession of the requisite information over two months prior to the deadline to amend the \npleadings. Defendants argue that they could not have met the deaqline to amend pleadings because \nI \nthey \"needed time to carefully review thousands of pages of documents to piece together its \ninequitable conduct claims.\" (D.I. 90 at 15). Courts in this district, however, have rejected \n5 \"voluminous document production during discovery\" as an excuse for delay. Pfizer Inc., v. Sandoz \nInc,, 2,013 WL 5934635, at *3, *5 (D. Del. Nov. 4, 2013). \nFurthermore, the cases Defendants cite in support of their argument are either inapposite \nor.distinguishable. The courts in Diaz-Cruz v. Williams, 2013 WL 2249293 (D. Del. May 22, \n2013); Eisai Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 247 F.R.D. 445, 448 n.1 (D.N.J. 2009); and Biovail \nLab ys Int'! SRL v. Andrx Pharms., LLC, 2007 WL 3231684 (D. Del. May 4, 2007), applied Rule \n15' s less demanding standard, not Rule 16' s good cause standard. They are, therefore, not \napplicable to this analysis. Defendants also cite to Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Di gene Corp., 270 \nF. Supp. 2d 484, 489 (D. Del. 2003), and Roquette Freres, 2009 WL 1444835, at *5, but the \nmovants in both of those cases filed their motions within two months of learning of the required \ninformation for their proposed amendments. Defendants in this case, however, had the information \nover two months prior to the deadline to amend pleadings. Therefore, Defendants have failed to \nmeet their burden of demonstrating that even with diligence they could not meet the court's \nscheduling order. \n\"[Q]ther courts in the Third Circuit have found diligence when a party has sought to leave \nto amend within three months of learning new information .... \" Home Semiconductor Corp. v. \nSamsung Elecs. Co., 2019 WL 2135858, at *5 (D. Del. May 16, 2019). Even ifl were to find that \nDefendants could not meet the court's scheduling order due to the timing and volume of Plaintiff's \ndocument production, Defendants still cannot demonstrate good cause because they were not \ndiligent in filing this motion. See NRT Tech. Corp. v. Everi Holdings Inc., 2022 WL 354291, at *3 \n(Dl Del. Jan. 11, 2022) (rejecting the argument \"that an inability to timely amend a pleading within \nthe scheduling order deadline excuses a party from exercising diligence in seeking leave to amend \noutside of the deadline\"). \n6 \n' First, five months elapsed from the time Defendants acquired the information to the time \nthey filed the motion, and shorter delays have been found to negate arguments for good cause. See \nPfizer, 2013 WL 5934635, at *4 (finding a \"substantial delay\" of four months from the final \ndeposition to filing the motion was undue delay under Rule 15(a) and evidence of lack of good \n' \nca{ise under Rule 16(b)). \nSecond, Defendants appear to have been able to have brought the claim of inequitable \nco\u00b5duct in late June, two months before they filed this motion, as they included an inequitable \nconduct theory' in their invalidity contentions, which Defendants served on June 30, 2022. (D.I. 96 \nat :12-13; D.I. 64). Defendants provide no explanation for the delay between then and when they \nI \nnotified Plaintiff they intended to move to amend their answer on July 20, 2022 (D.I. 96, Ex.Eat \n1 ), or for the further delay to when they filed the motion on August 19, 2022, which undermines \nthJir argument of diligence. See Genentech, Inc. v. Amgen Inc., 2020 WL 708113, at *1 (D. Del. \nFep. 12, 2020) (finding the movant failed to show good cause when it had the ability to plead an \ninequitable conduct claim two months before it filed its motion and did not provide an explanation \nfo~ the delay). \nThird, Defendants appear to have brought this motion at this time not because of their \ndiligence, but, instead, in response to Plaintiff's threat to file a motion to strike the inequitable \nconduct claim from Defendants' invalidity contention. (D.l. 96, Ex. D at 1-2; D.I. 96, Ex.Eat 1). \nTherefore, even if the proximity of Plaintiffs document production to the deadline to \nan:+end ple~dings were to excuse Defendants from meeting the deadline, that does not excuse their \nlack of diligence thereafter. See, e.g., NRT Tech., 2022 WL 354291, at *3 (\"Defendants' delay in \nproducing documents does not give Plaintiffs license to delay seeking leave to amend for an \nadditional six months.\"). \n7 Because I find that Defendants have not satisfied Rule 16(b )( 4)' s standard, it is not \nnecessary to determine whether Defendants meet Rule 15(a)'s requirements. See Premier Comp \nSols. v. UPMC, 970 F.3d 316,319 (3d Cir. 2020). \nIV.
