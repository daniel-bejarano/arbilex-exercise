Civil Action No. 22-409-RGA\nEARL GEORGE (d/b/a EDEN SALT, INC.,\nEDEN SALT LLC, EDEN SALT, and\nEDEN IMPORT AND EXPORTS),\n\nEDEN IMPORT & EXPORT LLC (d/b/a\nEDEN SALT IMPORT and EXPORT LLC\nAND EDEN SALT), and SERVING WITH\nA MISSION,\n\nDefendants.\n\nmS SS SS SS SS SSS OS\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\nPresently before the court in this civil action for trademark infringement and related state\nlaw claims is the motion for entry of default judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n55(b)(2), filed by Plaintiff Eden Foods, Inc. (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) against Defendants Earl George (d/b/a\nEden Salt, Inc., Eden Salt LLC, Eden Salt and Eden Import and Exports), and Eden Import &\nExport LLC (d/b/a Eden Salt Import and Export LLC and Eden Salt), and Serving With a\nMission (collectively, the \u201cDefaulting Defendants\u201d). (D.I. 30)! For the following reasons, I\nrecommend that the court GRANT Plaintiff's motion for entry of default judgment under Rule\n\n55(b)(2) and issue a permanent injunction against the Defaulting Defendants.\n\n! The briefing and other filings associated with the pending motion for default judgment are\nfound at D.I. 31, D.I. 32, D.L. 33, and D.I. 35.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff began as a food co-operative in the mid to late 1960s, and after finding initial\nsuccess with its organic retail food store, it began branding its own organic food products under\nthe \u201cEden\u201d trademark around 1969. (D.I. 33 at {] 4-5) Plaintiff has operated continuously since\nthen and continues to use its \u201cEden\u201d trademark and brand name. (D.I. 33 at J 5)\n\nFor more than twenty years Plaintiff has sold \u201cEden\u201d branded salt. (D.I. 33 at | 19)\nThree of Plaintiff\u2019s marks specifically relate to salts sold under the Eden\u00ae family of trademarks:\nRegistration Nos. 1,452,337 (\u201cthe 2337 mark\u201d), 1,862,634 (\u201cthe \u2019634 mark\u201d), and 3,071,337\n(\u201cthe \u20191337 mark\u201d). (D.I. 15 at J 26-7, 33) Plaintiff first registered a mark relating to salt in\n1987, with the 2337 mark registering \u201cEden\u201d as a trademark for food and beverage products\nincluding \u201csea salt for table use.\u201d (D.I. 33 at \u00a7 20) Plaintiff registered the \u201cEden\u201d trademark for\nadditional food and beverages, including \u201csea salt\u201d in 1994 under the 634 mark. (D.L. 33 at J\n20) Plaintiff also registered \u201cEden Foods\u201d as a trademark for \u201csalt\u201d in 2006 with the 1337 mark.\n(D.I. 33 at \u00a7 20) All of these trademarks have been duly renewed and remain in effect. (D.I. 33\nat { 20)\n\nOn January 12, 2022, the Defaulting Defendants submitted an application to the United\nStates Patent & Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") for the trademark \u201cEden Salt.\u201d (D.I. 32-1 at 2)\nWithin this trademark application, the Defaulting Defendants indicated that \u201cEden Salt\u201d had\nbeen used in commerce since May 7, 2021. (/d.) The Defaulting Defendants\u2019 trademark\napplication also stated the applicant has used the trademark \u201cEden Salt\u201d in interstate commerce\nat least as early as July 5, 2021. (D.I. 15 at | 64) This trademark application was signed by\n\u201cEarl George\u201d and listed Eden Salt\u2019s office address as 501 Silverside Rd., PBM#371,\n\nWilmington, Delaware 19809. (D.I. 32 at { 7)\nThereafter, Plaintiff sent two letters to Andrea Selkregg (\u201cSelkregg\u201d), the attorney who\nfiled the Eden Salt trademark application, asking her to provide details on the identity of her\nclient. (D.I. 32 at 10) A letter to Selkregg dated February 4, 2022, represented that the\nDefaulting Defendants\u2019 trademark application for Eden Salt likely infringed Plaintiff's family of\nEden Foods marks. (D.I. 15 at (66) Selkregg indicated she forwarded the information to her\nclient and stated that she did not represent Eden Salt in the trademark dispute with Eden Foods.\n(DL. 32 at \u00a2 11) On March 8, 2022, Plaintiff contacted Selkregg again to request contact\ninformation for a principal or officer of Eden Salt. (D.I. 32 at ] 12) Selkregg indicated that she\nhad forwarded the information to her client but declined to provide any more information. (Jd.)\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Plaintiff contacted the number listed on the Defaulting Defendants\u2019\nwebsite to obtain information about their directors and officers. (D.I. 32 at 13) The person\nwho answered the phone identified himself only as \u201cPresident\u201d of Eden Salt. (/d.) This\nindividual stated he was represented by counsel in the trademark dispute between Eden Salt and\nEden Foods, but he declined to identify his counsel. (/d.) Plaintiffs counsel was unable to\nengage further given that the individual claimed to be represented by counsel. (/d.)\n\nOn March 30, 2022, Plaintiff commenced this action against the Defaulting Defendants\nalleging that they used Plaintiff\u2019s marks as part of their trademark application for \u201cEDEN\nSALT,\u201d in their trade and domain names, and in the distribution and marketing of their salt\nproducts at the wholesale and/or retail level. (D.I. 1 at Ff 40-44; D.I. 15 at J] 50-54) About a\nweek after the complaint was filed, the court entered an order permitting Plaintiff to serve\nlimited, expedited discovery to ascertain the identities of the Defaulting Defendants. (D.I. 9)\n\nPlaintiff then filed a first amended complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) on May 27, 2022, which names the\nDefaulting Defendants and is otherwise substantively the same as the original complaint. (D.I.\n15 at ff] 4-5)\n\nThe record before the court indicates Plaintiff served the FAC and summons on\ndefendant Serving With A Mission by way of its receiving agent on June 9, 2022. (D.I. 19) The\nfollowing day, Plaintiff served the FAC and summons on the authorized agent of Earl George\nand Eden Import & Export LLC. (D.I. 17; D.I. 18) The Defaulting Defendants failed to file and\nserve a timely responsive pleading as required under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\n\nShortly before the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 responsive pleading deadline expired, Plaintiff\nrepresented on the record that it had faced significant hurdles in serving the Defaulting\nDefendants, and it had not been able to personally serve Earl George or Eden Import & Export\nLLC. (DL 20; D.I. 21) On August 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed two affidavits of service detailing its\nadditional attempts to personally serve Earl George and Eden Import & Export LLC at Earl\nGeorge\u2019s Brooklyn apartment, ending with the process server posting the summons and FAC on\nthe door of the apartment on July 20, 2022, and mailing the summons and FAC to two Brooklyn\naddresses the following day. (D.I. 24; D.I. 25)\n\nOn August 18, 2022, the court entered a default in appearance against the Defaulting\nDefendants, finding that service was effectuated based on the executed summonses, the affidavits\nof service, and the representations made in the declaration accompanying the request for entry of\ndefault. (D.I. 28; D.I. 29) The court also allowed Plaintiff to issue subpoenas to any registrar for\nthe edensalt.com domain. (D.I. 28)\n\nPlaintiff filed the pending motion for entry of default judgment pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2)\n\non September 12, 2022. (D.I. 30) The assigned District Judge referred the pending motion to\nthe undersigned judicial officer on October 21, 2022. (D.I. 34) On November 1, 2022, Plaintiff\nfiled a letter confirming that the USPTO refused to register \u201cEden Salt\u201d due to a likelihood of\nconfusion with Plaintiff's marks. (D.I. 35)\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2) provides that a district court may enter default\njudgment against a party when default has been entered by the Clerk of Court. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n55(b). The decision to enter a default judgment is within the discretion of the court. Tristrata\nTech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy Rsch., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D. Del. 2010) (citing Hritz v.\nWoma Corp., 732 F.2d 1178, 1180 (3d Cir. 1984)). The court\u2019s determination is guided by three\nconsiderations: \u201c(1) prejudice to the plaintiff if default is denied, (2) whether the defendant\nappears to have a litigable defense, and (3) whether defendant\u2019s delay is due to culpable\nconduct.\u201d Chamberlain v. Giampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 2000). \u201cA consequence of the\nentry of a default judgment is that the factual allegations of the complaint, except those relating\nto the amount of damages, will be taken as true.\u201d Comdyne I, Inc. v. Corbin, 908 F.2d 1142,\n1149 (3d Cir. 1990); see J & J Sports Prod., Inc. v. Kim, C.A. No. 14-1170-LPS, 2016 WL\n1238223, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2016).\n\nThe court may conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the amount of damages or\nestablish the truth of the allegations. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). However, \u201cRule 55 does not\nrequire that testimony be presented as a prerequisite to the entry of a default judgment[.J]\u201d 10A\nC. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2688 (3d ed. 2007); see Rhino Assocs.,\nL.P. v. Berg Mfg. & Sales Corp., 531 F. Supp. 2d 652, 657 (M.D. Pa. 2007). Plaintiff seeks only\ninjunctive relief in this instance, and for the reasons set forth below, the uncontroverted factual\n\nallegations in the FAC obviate the need for a hearing to substantiate Plaintiff's proposed\npermanent injunction. See S.E.C. v. Krimm, C.A. No. 17-464-RDM, 2019 WL 2270437, at *5\n(D. Del. May 28, 2019) (granting proposed injunctive relief without a hearing on a motion for\ndefault judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2)).\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Default Judgment\n\nI recommend that the court grant Plaintiff's motion for default judgment against the\nDefaulting Defendants. As described at \u00a7 I, supra, Plaintiff served the FAC on the Defaulting\nDefendants, who failed to answer or otherwise respond, and the Clerk of Court entered a default\nin appearance against the Defaulting Defendants. Accordingly, the court takes as true the\nunchallenged factual allegations in the FAC, which plausibly establish the Defaulting\nDefendants\u2019 use of Plaintiff's marks will cause a likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act.\nSee Comdyne I, 908 F.2d at 1149; A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237\nF.3d 198, 202 (3d Cir. 2000) (explaining that trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\nand unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(A) are measured by identical standards).\nThe plausibility of Plaintiff's Lanham Act claims extends to the remaining claims brought under\nDelaware state and common law. See Acxiom Corp. v. Axiom, Inc., 27 F. Supp. 2d 478, 506-07\n(D. Del. 1998) (finding it unnecessary to determine whether Axiom\u2019s actions infringed under the\nLanham Act and under Delaware state law or common law because the state law claims are\nsimilar to their federal counterparts in both scope and remedy); see also Mil. Certified\nResidential Specialist, LLC v. Fairway Indep. Mortg. Corp., 251 F. Supp. 3d 750 (D. Del. 2017);\nsee also S&P Glob. Inc. v. S&P Data LLC, C.A. No. 20-701-RGA, 2022 WL 3098096 at *17 n.2\n\n(D. Del. Aug. 4, 2022).\nMoreover, the factors articulated by the Third Circuit in Chamberlain weigh in favor of\ndefault judgment against the Defaulting Defendants. See Chamberlain, 210 F.3d at 164. First,\nPlaintiff has shown it will be prejudiced by its inability to enforce its marks if the motion is\ndenied because the Defaulting Defendants have been unresponsive to Plaintiff's efforts to\ncommunicate and will likely continue to infringe Plaintiff's trademarks. (D.I. 15 at ff 64-68);\nsee Tristrata Tech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy Rsch., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D. Del. 2010)\n(finding prejudice resulting from inability to enforce patent rights or recover damages). Denial\nof default judgment will prejudice Plaintiff by precluding \u201cany effective avenue for obtaining\nrelief[.]\u201d Roy v. Sakhr Software Co. (K.S.C.C.), C.A. No. 11-863-LPS, 2015 WL 4608132, at *2\n(D. Del. July 31, 2015).\n\nThe second Chamberlain factor also weighs in favor of default judgment. Whether the\nDefaulting Defendants have a litigable defense is unclear due to their failure to appear and\nparticipate in the litigation. See Tristrata, 270 F.R.D. at 164. The strength of Plaintiff's pleaded\nallegations on the likelihood of confusion also reduces the odds that the Defaulting Defendants\ncould present a meritorious defense. Plaintiff's registered marks \u201cEDEN\u201d and \u201cEDEN FOODS\u201d\nare facially similar to the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 name \u201cEden Salt.\u201d See Javo Beverage Co.,\nInc. v. Javy Coffee Co., C.A. No. 22-547-RGA, 2023 WL 387587, at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 25, 2023)\n(finding a likelihood of confusion to be plausible between \u201cJavo\u201d and \u201cJavy\u201d). This similarity is\nfurther confirmed by the USPTO\u2019s rejection of the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 trademark application\nfor \u201cEden Salt\u201d based on the likelihood of confusion with Plaintiffs marks. (D.I. 35 at 2-3) The\nfactual allegations in the FAC also establish Plaintiff's decades-long use of its marks in the food\nmarket, (D.I. 15 at ff 25-27, 33); the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 marketing of their products through\n\nthe same channels as Plaintiff, (id. at \u00a2 70; see also D.I. 33 at \u00a7 26-27; D.I. 32 at \u00a2 33); and the\nDefaulting Defendants\u2019 continued use of Plaintiff's marks despite actual knowledge of them.\n(D.I. 15 at FJ 66, 69-71)\n\nThe third and final Chamberlain factor weighs in favor of default judgment because the\nDefaulting Defendants have been on notice of this action, and their decision not to defend against\nthe allegations in the FAC amounts to willful and culpable conduct. See Krimm, 2019 WL\n2270437, at *5. Plaintiff has reached out to the Defaulting Defendants on several occasions,\nsending notice of their infringement, following up with the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 trademark\nattorney, and calling the \u201cEden Salt\u201d number listed on the website. (D.I. 15 at {J 66-68)\nNonetheless, the Defaulting Defendants have responded with evasiveness. (/d.; D.I. 32 at 4 11-\n13, 28-31) For these reasons, I recommend that the court grant Plaintiff's motion for default\njudgment under Rule 55(b)(2).\n\nB. Permanent Injunction\n\nPlaintiff asks the court to permanently enjoin the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 conduct. (D.I.\n30 at 1) The court may award injunctive relief under the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116.\nGenerally, a party prevailing on the merits must show four factors to obtain a permanent\ninjunction: (1) it will suffer irreparable injury; (2) no remedy available at law would be\nsufficient; (3) the balance of hardships tips in its favor; and (4) the injunction would serve public\ninterests. TD Bank N.A. v. Hill, 928 F.3d 259, 278 (3d Cir. 2019). In the \u201cspecialized context\u201d\nof a default judgment, where the defendant does not respond and the plaintiff cannot quantify its\ndamages, these factors generally weigh in favor of injunctive relief. See Ottomanson, Inc. v.\nUCAI, LLC, 2020 WL 205945, at *4 (D.N.J. Jan. 10, 2020) (\u201cMerely enjoining infringement\ndoes not deprive the defendant of anything to which it is entitled, and it is in the public interest to\n\ndo so.\u201d).\nBecause liability for trademark infringement and unfair competition has been established\nand Plaintiff has shown that future violations are likely, the court may issue a permanent\ninjunction. See Krimm, 2019 WL 2270437, at *6 (issuing permanent injunctive relief on a\nmotion for default judgment because defendants did not respond to the complaint or otherwise\nrepresent that future violations were unlikely); see also Innovative Office Prods., Inc. v.\nAmazon.com, Inc., 2012 WL 1466512, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 26, 2012) (issuing a permanent\ninjunction based on acceptance of infringement allegation as true for purposes of the motion for\ndefault judgment). Consequently, I recommend that the court issue a permanent injunction\nagainst the Defaulting Defendants consistent with the relief sought at paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of\nPlaintiff's proposed order. (D.I. 30-1 at f{ 4-5, 7)\n\nHowever, Plaintiff's proposed order seeks a broad spectrum of injunctive relief. I\nrecommend that the court deny the relief sought at paragraphs 6, 8, and 9 of Plaintiff's proposed\norder because these requests for relief are not adequately supported by the record and the\napplicable case authorities. (D.I. 30-1 at ff 6, 8-9)\n\nI recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs requested relief at paragraph 6 of the\nproposed order, which seeks a transfer by the Defaulting Defendants and/or the domain name\nregistrar of \u201cany and all rights to any domain name(s) that any of the enjoined persons possesses\nor controls, where the domain name contains the word \u2018EDEN\u2019 (including but not limited to\nedensalt.com).\u201d (D.I. 30-1 at ]6) Plaintiffs request is made pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1125(d)(1)(C), which authorizes the court to \u201corder the forfeiture or cancellation of the domain\nname or the transfer of the domain name to the owner of the mark.\u201d But \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(C)\nprovides relief for violations of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\u201cACPA\u201d),\n\nwhich specifically addresses trademark violations in the registration, trafficking, or use of a\ndomain name. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d); see Pa. Business Bank v. Biz Bank Corp., 330 F. Supp. 2d\n511 (ED. Pa. 2004) (analyzing trademark infringement under \u00a7 1114 and cybersquatting under \u00a7\n1125(d) as separate causes of action). Because Plaintiff's complaint does not allege a cause of\naction under the ACPA, Plaintiff has failed to make the requisite showing of liability to support\nthe remedy of a domain name transfer under \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(C). Cf Ownum, LLC v. Ownum, Inc.,\nC.A. No. 19-1043-MN-JLH, 2020 WL 8882941, at *1, 4 (D. Del. Apr. 17, 2020) (granting\ntransfer of a domain name to the plaintiff on a motion for default judgment where the case\n\u201cinvolve[d] an alleged violation of the [ACPA].\u201d).\n\nI recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs requested relief at paragraph 8 of the\nproposed order, which seeks to enjoin the Defaulting Defendants \u201cfrom filing any trademark\napplication seeking to register any trademark that incorporates \u2018EDEN\u2019 or any other word\nconfusingly similar thereto, and that Earl George and Eden Import & Export LLC must withdraw\nany such pending applications.\u201d (D.J. 30-1 at \u00a78) The record shows that the Defaulting\nDefendants already filed a trademark application which was denied due to a likelihood of\nconfusion with Plaintiff's mark. (D.I. 35) Plaintiff has failed to provide any authority\nsupporting this request, and the court finds no basis to grant the request.\n\nFinally, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiff's requested relief at paragraph 9 of the\nproposed order, which seeks to compel the Defaulting Defendants to \u201cdeliver up for destruction\nor other disposition by Plaintiff, all EDEN SALT products as well as any advertisements,\nbrochures, labels, product packaging, signs, prints, decals, business cards, order forms, stickers,\ntags, promotional materials, and other items in their possession, custody or control on which the\nEDEN mark appears (alone or in combination with other terms)[.]\u201d (D.I. 30-1 at ]9) Plaintiff\n\ncites 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1118 in support of this request, which provides that the decision whether to\n\n10\nenter a destruction order is left to the court's discretion. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1118 (providing that\n\u201cthe court may order that all labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles, and\nadvertisements\u201d to be delivered up and destroyed); Daimler AG v. A-Z Wheels LLC, 498 F. Supp.\n3d 1282 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (\u201cUnder 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1118, the decision whether to enter a destruction\norder is left to the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d). Having recommended a permanent injunction against\nfurther infringement under the Lanham Act, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiff's request\nfor an order requiring the destruction of any infringing articles as unnecessary. See Kelley Blue\nBook v. Car-Smarts, Inc., 802 F. Supp. 278, 293 (C.D. Cal. 1992) (\u201c[W]here an injunction is\nissued under the Lanham Act enjoining an infringer from further infringement, the rights of the\nplaintiff are adequately protected and an order requiring destruction of infringing articles, though\npermitted, may be unnecessary.\u201d).\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT Plaintiff's motion for\nentry of default judgment under Rule 55(b)(2), enter judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 58, and issue a permanent injunction in the following form:\n\nIT IS ORDERED that the Defaulting Defendants shall cease and desist\nfrom any and all infringement of Plaintiff's rights in its registered marks which\nare identified in the motion for default judgment.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each of the Defaulting Defendants is\n\nenjoined from any use of \u201cEDEN\u201d (alone or in combination with other terms,\n\nincluding but not limited to \u201cEDEN SALT\u201d) or any words confusingly similar\n\nthereto, as a trademark, trade name, corporate name, domain name, social media\n\npresence, or other commercial indication of origin, or that incorporates EDEN in\n\n11\nconnection with the advertising, display, sale, offering for sale or distribution of\n\nany products in any medium, whether through wholesale, retail or online channels\n\n(including but not limited to sales on the Internet, through Amazon, through any\n\nAmazon storefront or via any other online presence).\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each of the Defaulting Defendants is\n\nenjoined from operating the edensalt.com website.\n\nPlaintiff shall serve a copy of this Report and Recommendation on the Defaulting\nDefendants and shall file proof of such service with the court once service is complete.\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to three (3)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage y. Barnhart, 171 F.
