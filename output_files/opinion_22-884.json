(D.I. 5) For the reasons discussed below, the Court will deny the motion and\n_ will sua sponte remand the matter to the Family Court of the State of Delaware in and\nfor Sussex County for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis case involves a petition for modification of custody filed by Petitioner David\nMoskowitz on June 21, 2021, Petition No. 21-1524. (See D.I. 1-1 at 2-12; Moskowitz v.\nGreenberg, Case No. CS20-1349) Petitioner resides in the State of Delaware and\nRespondent resides in the State of New Jersey. (D.I. 1 at 20-22) Respondent removed\nthis matter from the Delaware Family Court on June 30, 2022 and asserts jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343, 1367, 1443, 1446(b), and 2403. (/d. at 18)\nRespondent, who also refers to herself as Plaintiff, has combined the notice of removal\nwith what appears to be a civil and criminal complaint or counterclaim against the State\nof Delaware; County of Sussex, Delaware; Judge Peter B. Jones; Moskowitz; and his\nattorney Judy M. Jones. (/d. at 1) Respondent alleges criminal conspiracy and criminal\nviolations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242, violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth,\n\n_ Tenth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 et seq.,\nFalse Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729, et seq., violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1985,\n\n1986, and 2000b-2, and state claims under Delaware law including the failure to initiate\n1\ncriminal process under Delaware law, malicious prosecution, gross negligence, abuse\nof process, and threats of fall arrest and wrongful imprisonment. (/d. at 18, 19, 22, 40,\n42)\n\nRespondent seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and civil damages. (/d. at 44)\nli. DISCUSSION\n\nRespondent removed the child custody matter to this Court and has filed a\ncomplaint or counterclaim against Petitioner and various other individuals. Having\nreviewed the notice of removal and underlying documents the Court will sua sponte\nremand this action back to Family Court because this Court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction. Thomas v. BJ\u2019S Wholesale Club, Inc., 2020 WL 1853036, at *2 (D.N.J. Apr.\n13, 2020) (\u201cCourts have an independent obligation to satisfy themselves of jurisdiction if\nit is in doubt.\u201d); Bank of New York Mellon for Certificate holders of CWALT, Inc.,\nAlternative Loan Tr. 2006-0A10 Mortg. Pass-Through Certificates Series 2006-0A10 v.\nMazza, 743 F. App\u2019x 504, 506 (3d Cir. 2018) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447 \u201cdoes not authorize a\nDistrict Court to remand a matter sua sponte for any reason other than lack of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction\u2019).\n\nA defendant may remove a civil action to federal court if the federal court would\nhave original jurisdiction to hear the matter in the first instance. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a);\nBoyer v. Snap-on Tools Corp., 913 F.2d 108, 111 (3d Cir. 1990). Where subject matter\njurisdiction is based on diversity jurisdiction, all plaintiffs must be of diverse citizenship\nfrom all defendants, and the amount in controversy must exceed $75.000. See 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a): Grand Union Supermarkets of the V.1., Inc. v. H.E. Lockhart Mgmt.,\n\nInc., 316 F.3d 408, 410 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has long recognized a domestic relations exception to\nfederal diversity jurisdiction.\u201d Matusow v. Trans-Cty. Title Agency, LLC, 545 F.3d 241,\n245 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 693-94 (1992)). \u201cThe\nmodern rule . . . provides that the domestic relations exception encompasses only\ncases involving the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.\u201d /d.; Brown\nv. Brown, 783 F. App\u2019x 267 (3d Cir. 2019) (affirming dismissal with prejudice where\nplaintiff had \u201cmistaken belief\u2019 that district court was \u201cthe next step in the appeals\nprocess for his child custody case\u201d in state court), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 341 (2020);\nBrookins v. Whatley, 2017 WL 3710064, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. 28, 2017) (Plaintiff's\nstatement that \u201cI only want and need my children back\u201d functions \u201cas a child-custody\ndecree that is subject to the \u2018domestic relations\u2019 exception\u201d over which this Court cannot\nexercise subject-matter jurisdiction.). To the extent that Respondent seeks to pursue a\ncomplaint and/or counterclaim, she \u201ccannot obtain federal jurisdiction merely by\nrewriting a domestic dispute as a tort claim for monetary damages.\u201d Thomas v. Martin-\nGibbons, 2021 WL 2065892, at *3 (2d Cir. May 24, 2021).\n\nAs evidenced by the exhibits attached to the Notice of Removal, Respondent\nclearly challenges an ongoing custody proceeding. (See D.|. 1, Exs. A-H) It is clear\nthat Respondent seeks to have this Court intervene in a custody dispute involving a\nminor child. Thus, diversity jurisdiction is barred by the domestic relations exception.\nShould the outcome be unfavorable to Respondent there remains a state appeals\nprocess for her to pursue.\n\nRespondent\u2019s emergency motion to quash state court action during removal fails.\n\n(D.I. 5) Respondent sought relief following entry of a Family Court order that awarded\n3\ntemporary custody to Petitioner. (/d.) As just discussed, this Court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction. Any relief sought by Respondent must be pursued in state court.\nAccordingly, the motion will be denied\nIll. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will: (1) deny Respondent\u2019s motion\nto quash state court action during removal (D.1. 5); and (2) remand this matter for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nDAVID MOSKOWITZ,\n\nPetitioner, Civil Action No. 22-884-CFC\n\n: The Family Court of the State of Delaware\nV. \u2018in and for Sussex County\n: File No. CS20-1349\nALAINA GREENBERG, : Petition No. 21-15124-CMOD\nRespondent. :\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this f Tray of November, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the\nmemorandum opinion issued this date;\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1.
