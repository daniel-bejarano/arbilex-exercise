Hudson, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Wilmington, \nDelaware \nCounsel for United States \nJeffrey Helm \nPro Se Defendant \nMarch 2, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION .CONNOLLY \nCI--IlEF JUDGE \nPending before me is Defendant Jeffrey Helm's Motion for Compassionate \nRelease Pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A). D.I. 53. Section \n3582(c)(l)(A)(i) empowers the Court to modify a term of imprisonment when \n\"extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction\" after considering \nsentencing factors under\u00a7 3553. Helm contends that his sentence should be \nreduced because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and his asthma, D.I. 53 at 5-\n11; Helm's \"commendable prison conduct,\" D.I. 53 at 13-14; and the incapacity of \nthe caregiver of Helm's daughter, D.I. 53 at 14-16. The Government opposes \nHelm's motion. See D.I. 54. \nI. BACKGROUND \nHelm is 35 years old. He was sentenced to 60 months of incarceration for \npossession of marijuana with intent to distribute and 72 months of incarceration for \npossession of a firearm by a prohibited person, with the sentences to run \nconcurrently. Helm has been detained since June 2019. Tr. of Oct. 1, 2020 Hr'g at \n48. The Government states that Helm's anticipated release date is February 6, \n2026. D.I. 54 at 3. A. Helm's Health and COVID-19 Risk \nHelm has asthma and, according to the Government, a history of smoking, \npreexisting conditions that increase his risk of serious illness from COVID-19. \nD.I. 53 at 8; D.I. 55 at 4. Helm is currently incarcerated at Fort Dix and alleges \nthat \"persistent failures to take even the most modest possible [COVID] \nprecautions\" and \"large-scale\" outbreaks of COVID-19 at Fort Dix have left him \nvulnerable to \"grave health consequences\" from a COVID-19 infection. D.I. 53 at \n8-11. The Government asserts that Helm lacks an asthma diagnosis; that Helm's \nnasal allergy symptoms are not severe; and that Helm previously tested positive for \nCOVID-19 and recovered without symptoms. D.I. 55 at 4-5; D.I. 55, Exhibit A \n(medical records of Feb. 11, 2021). Further, according to the Government, \"the \nBureau of Prisons ('BOP') [has] made extensive changes to its operations\" to \nrespond to the pandemic and the BOP had fully vaccinated roughly 70 percent of \nFort Dix's inmates, including Helm, as of January 11, 2022. D.I. 54 at 5-9; D.I. 55 \nat 5; D.I. 55, Exhibit A (medical records of Nov. 23, 2020, showing two doses of \nthe Pfizer vaccine). As of February 23, 2022, there had been two deaths due to \nCOVID-19 at Fort Dix. COVID-19: Coronavirus, Fed. Bur. Prisons (Accessed \nFeb. 24, 2022, 10:30 AM ET), https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/. \n2 B. Helm's Conduct in Prison \nHelm states and provides evidence that he has participated in extensive \ncoursework while in prison. D.I. 53 at 13-14, 22. Helm also received multiple \ncertificates lauding his vocational work at FDC Philadelphia; these certificates \ncited his willingness to \"offer[] unofficial mentoring\" and his status as a \"model \ninmate.\" D.I. 53 at 23-28. While Helm stated that he \"has not received a \ndisciplinary report during his incarceration in the BOP,\" the Government provided \nevidence that Helm was sanctioned for possessing a hazardous tool on November \n23, 2021. Compare D.I. 53 at 14, with D.I. 54-2 at 1. \nC. Caregiver for Helm's Daughter \nHelm alleges that his daughter's caregiver and legal guardian suffers or has \nsuffered from epilepsy, depression, and drug addiction, among other ailments, and \nthat the \"New York Division of Family Services opened a case of child \nendangerment in the past year\"; Helm also alleges that his daughter is in the \ncustody of Helm's mother-in-law, who \"suffers complications from congestive \nheart failure.\" D.I. 53 at 15. Helm did not provide any evidence that either his \ndaughter's caregiver or his mother-in-law had been deemed unfit to serve as \nguardian or that Helm has any custodial rights over his daughter. \nII. ANALYSIS \nIn general, a district court cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has \nbeen imposed unless a defendant is eligible for a reduction of sentence pursuant to \n3 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817, 819, 130 S. Ct. 2683, \n2687, 177 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2010) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)); United States v. \nMainor, 725 F. App'x 85, 86 (3d Cir. 2018). Section 3582 was amended in 2018 \nas part of the First Step Act. Pub. L. No. 115-391, Sec. 603(b), 132 Stat. 5194, \n5239 (Dec. 21, 2018). Before the enactment of the First Step Act, only the \nDirector of the Bureau of Prisons could file a motion seeking a sentence reduction, \nsometimes also called \"compassionate release.\" Now a motion may be filed by \neither the Director of the Bureau of Prisons or the defendant, except the defendant \nmay not file a motion until \"after [he or she] has fully exhausted all administrative \nrights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the \ndefendant's behalf or the lapse of 3 0 days from the receipt of such a request by the \nwarden of the defendant's facility, whichever is earlier .... \" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n3582(c)(l)(A). Here, Helm has filed the motion on his own behalf, and the \nGovernment concedes that Helm has met the exhaustion requirement. D.I. 54 at 5. \nAlthough the First Step Act changed the process by which inmates can \nrequest a reduced sentence, it did not alter the statutory standards that must be met \nfor that request to be granted. United States v. Andrews, 12 F.4th 255,258 (3d Cir. \n2021) (\"The First Step Act added the procedure for prisoner-initiated motions \nwhile leaving the rest of the compassionate-release framework unchanged.\"). The \nSentencing Reform Act of 19&4 established the statutory standard for reducing a \n4 sentence. Pub. L. No. 98-473, sec. 211, 98 Stat. 1837, 1987, 1998-99 (Oct. 12, \n1984 ). Under that statute, a Court may reduce the term of imprisonment if it finds \nthat \"extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction\" and that \n\"such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission\"; additionally, the court must \"consider[] the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a) [the factors for sentencing] to the extent that they are \napplicable .... \" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582( c )(1 )(A)(i).1 The Sentencing Reform Act did \nnot define what constitutes \"extraordinary and compelling reasons,\" instead \ndirecting the Sentencing Commission to promulgate policy statements that do so. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 994(a)(2)(C) and (t). Following enactment of the First Step Act, the \nThird Circuit has held that the Sentencing Commission's policy statements \"can \nguide discretion\" but may not serve \"as an ultimate binding authority.\" Andrews, \n12 F .4th at 260 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Under the relevant \npolicy statement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.13, a defendant is eligible for a sentence \nreduction if, after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court \ndetermines that three criteria are satisfied: ( 1) \"extraordinary and compelling \nreasons warrant the reduction\"; (2) \"the defendant is not a danger to the safety of \n1 \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A) also permits compassionate release under certain circumstances \nfor individuals at least 70 years of age. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(ii). That \nprovision is inapplicable here. \n5 any other person or to the community, as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)\"; and (3) \n\"the reduction is consistent with this policy statement.\" U.S. Sent'g Guidelines \nManual\u00a7 lBI.13 (U.S. Sent'g Comm'n 2021). \nA. Extraordinary and Compelling Reasons \nHelm asserts that his preexisting conditions, combined with his risk of \ncontracting serious illness from COVID-19; the incapacity of his daughter's \ncaregiver; and his behavior while in prison collectively and individually constitute \n\"extraordinary and compelling\" reasons for compassionate release. D.I. 53 at 1. \nWhile only a guide, the policy statement is helpful here. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IBI.13 \nwas first issued in November 2006 and its \"Application Notes\" section has been \namended substantively at least three times since then. The Application Notes \ncontain four categories of extraordinary and compelling reasons: ( 1) \"Medical \nCondition of the Defendant,\" (2) \"Age of the Defendant,\" (3) \"Family \nCircumstances,\" and (4) \"Other Reasons.\" U.S. Sent'g Guidelines Manual\u00a7 \nlBI.13 cmt. I. The second and fourth categories are inapplicable here: The \"Age \nof the Defendant\" reason requires Helm to be at least 65 years old, which he is not. \nId. at cmt. l{B). The catchall \"Other Reasons\" requires a determination of\"an \nextraordinary or compelling reason\" by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons. Id. \nat cmt. l(D). Because Helm filed this motion on his own behalf, the Director has \nmade no such determination. The \"Medical Conditions of Defendant\" and \"Family \n6 Circumstances\" reasons are potentially applicable. Helm also cites to his behavior \nwhile incarcerated, though it is not a consideration under the policy statement. \nAdditionally, I consider in guiding my analysis the ordinary and legal \nmeanings of\"extraordinary\" and \"compelling.\" Merriam Webster's Unabridged \nDictionary defines \"extraordinary\" as \"exceptional to a very marked extent\" or \"far \nfrom common,\" Extraordinary, Merriam Webster's Unabridged Dictionary \n(Accessed Feb. 25, 2022), https://unabridged.merriam-\nwebster .com/unabridged/ extraordinary, and defines \"compelling\" most pertinently \nas \"tending to convince or convert by or as if by forcefulness of evidence,\" \nCompelling, Merriam Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (Accessed Feb. 25, 2022), \nhttps://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/compelling. Black's Law \nDictionary defines \"extraordinary\" as \"[b]eyond what is usual, customary, regular, \nor common,\" Extraordinary, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019), and \n\"compelling need\" as \"[a] need so great that irreparable harm or injustice would \nresult if it is not met,\" Compelling Need, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). \nSee also United States v. Andrews, 2020 WL 4812626 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 19, 2020) \n(citing to Black's Law Dictionary), aff'd, 12 F.4th 255. \n1. Helm's Medical Conditions in Light of the COVID-19 \nPandemic \nIn determining whether Helm's medical conditions, in conjunction with the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, meet the \"extraordinary and compelling\" standard, the \n7 Application Notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.13 again provide useful guidance. Andrews, \n12 F .4th at 260 (\"Because Congress reenacted the compassionate-release statute \nwithout any alterations to the phrase 'extraordinary and compelling reasons,' it was \nreasonable for the court to conclude that the phrase largely retained the meaning it \nhad under the previous version of the statute [that pointed to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B 1.13].\" \n( citation omitted)). The Application Notes divide the \"Medical Condition of the \nDefendant\" into two subcategories: (i) terminal illness and (ii) non-terminal illness. \nSpecifically, they state that the medical condition of the defendant constitutes an \nextraordinary and compelling reason if: \n(i) The defendant is suffering from a terminal \nillness (i.e., a serious and advanced illness with an end of \nlife trajectory). A specific prognosis of life expectancy \n(i.e., a probability of death within a specific time period) \nis not required. Examples include metastatic solid-tumor \ncancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), end-stage \norgan disease, and advanced dementia. [or] \n(ii) The defendant is-\n(1) suffering from a serious physical or \nmedical condition, \n(II) suffering from a serious functional or \ncognitive impairment, or \n(III) experiencing deteriorating physical or \nmental health because of the aging process, \nthat substantially diminishes the ability of the \ndefendant to provide self-care within the \nenvironment of a correctional facility and from \nwhich he or she is not expected to recover. \nU.S. Sent'g Guidelines Manual\u00a7 1B1.13 cmt. l(A) (U.S. Sent'g Comm'n 2018). \nThe Sentencing Commission explained that non-terminal illnesses were \"intended \n8 to include a wide variety of permanent, serious impairments and disabilities, \nwhether functional or cognitive, that make life in prison overly difficult for certain \ninmates.\" Amend. 799 to U.S. Sent'g Guidelines Manual\u00a7 1B1.13. 1 (U.S. Sent'g \nComm'n 2016). \nIn his motion, Helm does not claim that he is currently diagnosed with a \nterminal illness or a \"serious\" non-terminal illness that \"substantially diminishes\" \nhis ability to provide self-care, as required by Sentencing Commission's policy \nstatement. Instead, Helm contends that his asthma and, as the Government notes, \nhistory of smoking, in combination with the COVID-19 pandemic, create a \nheightened risk that he will die or suffer \"grave health consequences associated \nwith [COVID-19] .... \" D.I. 53 at 8; D.I. 55 at 5.2 The Government contests \nHelm's alleged asthma, D.I. 55 at 4-5, 26-28, but I assume for purposes of \ndeciding this motion that Helm has asthma. The issue is whether Helm's alleged \nincreased risk of health consequences associated with COVID-19 is \"extraordinary \n2 The Government concedes that an inmate never offered a COVID-19 vaccine \nwho has asthma or a history of smoking would meet the policy statement's \nstandard of \"suffering from a serious physical or medical condition ... that \nsubstantially diminishes the ability of the defendant to provide self-care within the \nenvironment of a correctional facility .... \" D.I. 54 at 15, 16 n. 5. Here, Helm \nreceived a COVID-19 vaccine, so I need not consider the Government's \ncontention. D.I. 55, Exhibit A (medical records of Nov. 23, 2020). \n9 and compelling\" under\u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i) in light of the guidance U.S.S.G. \u00a7 \nl B 1.13 provides. \nI find that Helm's preexisting conditions fall short of showing a risk of \nbecoming \"grave[ly ]\" ill from COVID-19. The Third Circuit has held that \"the \nmere existence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a \nparticular prison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release.\" \nUnited States v. Raia, 954 F .3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020); see also United States v. \nRoeder, 803 F. App'x 157 n.16 (3d Cir. 2020) (\"[T]he existence of some health \nrisk to every federal prisoner as the result of this global pandemic does not, without \nmore, provide the sole basis for granting release to each and every prisoner within \nour Circuit.\"). Having asthma or a history of smoking and risking exposure to \nCOVID-19 is common or usual, rather than extraordinary. And the Third Circuit \nhas repeatedly upheld the denial of motions by inmates suffering from asthma for \nsentence reductions during the COVID-19 pandemic, even when the inmate's \nasthma was paired with other serious comorbidities. See, e.g., United States v. \nHill, 2022 WL 456327, at * l (3d Cir. Feb. 15, 2022) ( chronic liver disease and \nasthma); United States v. Millhouse, 2022 WL 396100, at *1-2 (3d Cir. Feb. 9, \n2022) (cardiac disease and asthma); United States v. Holloway, 2022 WL 216976, \nat *1 (3d Cir. Jan. 25, 2022) (mild obesity, hypertension, and asthma). The Third \nCircuit has, on at least one occasion, treated smoking similarly. United States v. \n10 Nichols, 849 F. App'x 334,335 (3d Cir. 2021) (smoking and family history of \nheart disease); see also United States v. Fertides, 2021 WL 5918301, at *1 (2d Cir. \nDec. 15, 2021) (finding no abuse of discretion in denying compassionate release \ndespite inmate's asthma, obesity, and history of smoking in light of COVID-19); \nUnited States v. Woodley, 2021 WL 3871910, at *2 (6th Cir. June 29, 2021) (same, \nbut well-controlled asthma, smoking, and high cholesterol). \nHelm has presented no medical or other records to indicate poor health that \nwould increase the likelihood that COVID-19 would cause him severe illness. \nAccording to the Presentence Investigation Report, Helm self-reported that he was \n\"healthy,\" despite his asthma. D.I. 40 ,r,r 116--17. And Helm has not alleged any \nchange to his health status, nor do Helm's medical records support one. See D.I. \n55, Exhibit A. Further, the BOP has taken various steps to reduce the likelihood \nthat Helm will contract COVID-19. As noted above, the Government reports that \nthe BOP had fully vaccinated roughly 70 percent of Fort Dix's inmate population \nas of January 11, 2022, and has taken extensive measures to control COVID-19's \nspread. D.I. 54 at 5-9. Helm's vaccination provides important additional \nprotection. See, e.g., Modema COVID-19 Vaccine 48, Food & Drug Admin. (Dec. \n17, 2020), https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download (finding an mRNA \nvaccine protects those with \"mild to severe asthma\" from symptomatic COVID-\n19). As such, Helm's asthma and history of smoking, in combination with the risk \n11 of contracting COVID-19 in light of current BOP efforts, is neither extraordinary \nnor compelling. \n2. Helm's Family Circumstances \nUnder the Sentencing Guidelines, \"Family Circumstances\" requires the \ndeath or incapacitation of either: (1) the caregiver of the defendant's minor \nchildren or (2) the defendant's spouse or registered partner. U.S. Sent'g \nGuidelines Manual\u00a7 lBI.13 cmt. l(C). I agree with Helm that this policy \nstatement provides useful guidance. See D.I. 53 at 15 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.13). \nHelm alleges that his daughter's caregiver and legal guardian suffers or has \nsuffered \"from epilepsy on a regular basis[,] ... bipolar disorder, depression[,] [] \nsuicidal thoughts[,] ... alcoholism[] [and] drug abuse issues\"; he further alleges \nthat the \"New York Division of Family Services opened a case of child \nendangerment in the past year.\" D.I. 53 at 15. According to Helm, his \"daughter \nis currently being cared for by [Helm]'s mother-in-law ... , who currently suffers \ncomplications from congestive heart failure.\" D.I. 53 at 15. Helm raised many of \nthese concerns with me previously at sentencing. Tr. at 10-14. But Helm provides \nno evidence that his mother-in-law's condition has or would likely render her \nincapable of being the caregiver for Helm's daughter. Further, Helm does not \nprovide any evidence that New York or any other state has adjudged his daughter's \nlegal guardian incapable or unfit. Additionally, as the Government notes, \"it is \n12 unclear whether [Helm] has any custodial rights with respect to his child or \nwhether, if released, those rights would be recognized and he would actually be \nawarded custody of his daughter.\" D.I. 54 at 31. A state may well deny Helm \ncustody, since authorities found marijuana and other related paraphernalia in \nHelm's daughter's bedroom, and Helm has committed several prior offenses. D.I. \n40 ,r,r 20, 50-78. Thus, Helm has not established that, even if his daughter's \ncurrent caregivers were unable to care for the child, Helm would be able to do so. \nHelm's family circumstances do not tend to \"convince or convert ... by \nforcefulness of evidence,\" Compelling, Merriam Webster's Unabridged \nDictionary, supra, and do not constitute an extraordinary and compelling reason \nfor a sentence reduction. \n3. Helm's Behavior While Incarcerated \nHelm's participation in coursework while in prison, D.I. 53 at 22, is \nconsistent with the rehabilitative goals of sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D), \nand thus is neither extraordinary nor compelling. Similarly, commendations for \nHelm's effective use of technical vocational skills at FDC Philadelphia, D.I. 53 at \n23-27, bode well for Helm's prospects upon release, but are not exceptional to a \nmarked extent; further, I considered some of these commendations at sentencing, \nsee Tr. at 16-18. The record contradicts Helm's assertion that he \"has not received \na disciplinary report during his incarceration in the BOP.\" Compare D.I. 53 at 14, \n13 with D.I. 54-2 at 1 (sanctioning Helm for possessing a hazardous tool on Nov. 23, \n2021 ). Thus, Helm's work and alleged good behavior while incarcerated do not \nconstitute extraordinary and compelling grounds for compassionate release. \n4. Joint Consideration of Factors \nHelm's medical conditions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, family \ncircumstances, and behavior while incarcerated are also not extraordinary and \ncompelling when considered jointly. Helm provides no additional considerations \nthat arise when evaluating these factors in light of one another, and I am unable to \nascertain any. For example, severe health risks would make it less likely that Helm \ncould adequately care for his daughter. That a prisoner has a common ailment \nduring a global pandemic, difficult family circumstances, and a record of efforts at \nrehabilitation does not rise to the level of extraordinary and compelling. \nTherefore, Helm has not demonstrated an extraordinary and compelling \nreason for compassionate release, and that alone is sufficient to deny Helm's \nmotion. \nB. \u00a7 3553(a) Factors \nEven if Helm had demonstrated an extraordinary and compelling reason for \ncompassionate release, I would still deny his motion after considering the factors \nset forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). United States v. Cole, 859 F. App'x 634,635 (3d \nCir. 2021) (finding\u00a7 3553(a) factors were an independent ground to deny a request \n14 for compassionate release due to compelling family circumstances). As an initial \nmatter, I considered these same factors at the time of sentencing on October 1, \n2020, only 13 months prior to Helm's motion. See Tr. at 38-43, 45. Little has \nchanged, and the factors support continued incarceration. See Holloway, 2022 WL \n216976, at *1 (considering the District Court's recent evaluation of the sentencing \nfactors in denying compassionate release). \nThe \"nature and circumstances of [Helm's] offense\" included possession of \ncontrolled substances ( with intent to distribute) and of a firearm while on probation \nfor a similar offense, and requiring Helm to serve out his sentence will better deter \nHelm from committing these crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l); D.I. 40 ,r,r 13-22. \nHelm's criminal history and violation of probation further support the need for \ndeterrence, and police discovery of drugs and related paraphernalia stored in \nHelm's daughter's bedroom supports the need to protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n3553(a)(2); D.I. 40 ,r,r 13, 16, 20, 47-79. Additionally, Helm has served less than \nhalf of his sentence; the lack of time to realize the sentence's deterrent and \nprotective value weighs against granting compassionate release. See United States \nv. Aguibi, 858 F. App'x 485,487 (3d Cir. 2021) {\"The District Court also \nreasonably determined that the fact that [the prisoner] had served less than half of \nhis 180-month sentence weighed against him.\" (citation omitted)). The relevant \nSentencing Commission policy statement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.13, does not support \n15 compassionate release, as explained above, and granting compassionate release \nwould create sentencing disparities, not avoid them. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5), \n(a)(6). Victim restitution is not relevant here. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(7). \nFinally, the kinds of sentences available and their established ranges weigh \nagainst compassionate release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3), (a)(4). Helm's Sentencing \nGuidelines range for imprisonment was 110-137 months. Tr. at 3, 8. I granted, \nwithout objection from the Government, a downward departure of Helm's criminal \nhistory category, resulting in a Guideline range of 100-125 months. Tr. at 8. \nThus, Helm's 72-month sentence reflects an additional downward variance of 28 \nmonths. The Third Circuit has upheld district courts' consideration of a downward \nvariance in evaluating a motion for compassionate release. See, e.g., United States \nv. Thomas, 2022 WL 296594, at * I (3d Cir. Feb. 1, 2022) (\"[The district court] \nalso observed that Thomas had served less than one-third of his term of \nimprisonment-which, as noted, already included a seven-year downward variance \nfrom the Guidelines range. Under these circumstances, the Court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in finding that the\u00a7 3553(a) factors defeated Thomas's petition for \nrelease.\"); United States v. McLean, 2021 WL 5896527, at *2 (3d Cir. Dec. 14, \n2021) (upholding on appeal the district court's consideration of a downward \nvariance in evaluating\u00a7 3553(a) factors). Thus, the\u00a7 3553 factors weigh against \n16 compassionate release, even when balanced against the medical conditions, family \ncircumstances, and good behavior that Helm raised. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nSince Helm has not provided extraordinary and compelling reasons for \nrelease and since the\u00a7 3553(a) factors weigh against release, I will deny Helm's \nmotion for compassionate release. \nThe Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n17 "}
