Andrews\u2019 docket to the\nundersigned\u2019s docket on February 27, 2019.\nCONNOLLY, CHIEF JYOGE:\n\nPetitioner Michael T. Washington has filed a Petition and an Amended Petition\nfor a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d). (D.1. 1; D.I. 69)\nThe State filed an Answer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 77; D.I.\n80) For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the Petition.\nL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Factual History\n\nIt appears from the record that Francis and Guy were found\nshot to death on September 1, 2008 (hereinafter \u201cthe\nshooting\u201d) in the front seat of a bullet-ridden black Lexus\n(hereinafter \u201cthe vehicle\u201d) in the 500 block of E. 10th Street.\nThe first police officer to arrive at the scene found the vehicle\nstopped in the middle of traffic, still in gear and wedged\nagainst another car.\n\nDetective John Ciritella of the Wilmington Police Department\n(hereinafter \u201cCiritella\u201d) was assigned to investigate the\nshooting. As the investigation unfolded, Ciritella theorized\nthat the shooting occurred from inside the vehicle as it was\nleaving the 700 block of E. 10th Street and that the vehicle\ncontinued moving until it came to a stop in the 500 block.\n\nCiritella recovered a significant number of bullets, bullet\nfragments and/or shell casings, from the interior of the vehicle,\nthe 700 block of E. 10th Street, and the victims\u2019 bodies\nfollowing the medical examiner's autopsies. Ciritella did not,\nhowever, recover a weapon that was used in the shooting.\n\nAt trial, Ciritella testified that initially and for several months\nafter the shooting, he could not develop a lead on a suspect.\nFinally, however, in April 2009, Ciritella was advised that an\ninmate in federal custody, Christopher Waterman, was\ninterested in disclosing information about the shooting that he\nhad allegedly heard from another inmate. The other inmate\nturned out to be [Petitioner]. Similarly, in May 2009 and\nDecember 2009, Ciritella learned that inmates William\nColeman and Isaiah Fields also wanted to disclose\ninformation that another inmate, again [Petitioner],\npurportedly told each of them about the shooting. Ciritella\nconducted individual one-on-one interviews with Waterman,\nColeman and Fields. As a result of those interviews, Ciritella\nlearned that between the fall of 2008 and the spring of 2009,\n[Petitioner] allegedly individually told Waterman, Coleman\nand Fields at different times that he was either in the vehicle\nduring the shooting or that he was the shooter, and that the\nweapon involved in the shooting was a \u201cMac 10,\u201d which\nCiritella knew was a candidate weapon. Ciritella also learned\nfrom Waterman, Coleman and Fields that the shooting was\npossibly the result of a botched robbery or a dispute over a\ndrug deal, and that the gun had discharged unexpectedly in\nthe vehicle.\n\nCiritella learned additional information from Coleman about\n[Petitioner's] possible involvement in the shooting, namely\nthat [Petitioner] was worried that a resident of the 700 block\nof E. 10th Street, April Gardner, had witnessed the shooting.\nMoreover, Fields told Ciritella that he was with [Petitioner] in\nJune or July 2008 at 930 Spruce Street, a drug hangout, when\nthe \u201cMac 10\u201d [Petitioner] was holding suddenly went off and\nsprayed gunfire.\n\nAs a result of his interview with Fields, Ciritella obtained a\nsearch warrant for 930 Spruce Street and in the ensuing\nsearch found a number of bullet holes in the floor and walls\nfrom which he recovered three bullets. From his interview with\nColeman, Ciritella was able to locate Gardner at her 729 E.\n10th Street home. Gardner told Ciritella that she witnessed\nthe events leading to the shooting on September 1, 2008 from\nthe front steps of her home.\n\nAt trial, Gardner testified that, prior to the shooting, she was\noutside sitting on her front steps watching her grandson ride\nhis bicycle when she observed [Petitioner] and another\nmale\u2014later identified as Guy\u2014walking down 10th Street.\nGardner told the jury that she knew [Petitioner] because he\nhad grown up in the neighborhood and had gone to school\nwith her children.\n\nGardner testified that she observed [Petitioner] and his\ncompanion approach another man who was sitting in the\ndriver's seat of a vehicle that was parked directly in front of\nher house. According to Gardner, after the three men\n\n3\nconversed briefly, Guy got into the right front passenger seat\nof the vehicle and [Petitioner] got into the right rear passenger\nseat.\n\nGardner testified that moments after the two men entered the\nvehicle the vehicle's windows \u201cerupted.\u201d Shocked by the\nexplosion, Gardner said, she immediately \u201cgrabbed [her]\ngrandson\u201d and ran to her daughter's house around the corner\non Bennett Street where she remained for several hours\nbefore returning home. Gardner testified that as she ran from\nthe scene, she could feel shards of glass getting caught in her\nhair, and that she had \u201cglass all in [her] hair\u2019 when she\nreached her daughter's house. Gardner further testified that\n[Petitioner] came to her home later that evening \u201cto\napologize,\u201d but that she refused to speak to him.\n\nOn September 28, 2009, [Petitioner] was charged with two\ncounts of Murder in the First Degree, two counts of\nPossession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony\nand one count of Possession of a Firearm by a Person\nProhibited. [Petitioner] went to trial on those charges on\nOctober 26, 2010.\n\nAt trial, the State's ballistics expert, Delaware State Police\nFirearms Examiner Carl Rone (hereinafter \u201cRone\u201d), opined\nthat the strafing of the vehicle's interior was the result of a\nsemi-automatic or automatic weapon discharging more than\nthirty rounds inside the vehicle from the area of the right rear\npassenger seat. Rone further opined that the sixteen bullets\nand thirty spent shell casings he examined, which were\nrecovered from the vehicle, the victims' bodies, and 930\nSpruce Street, all came from the same semi-automatic or\nautomatic weapon.\n\n[Petitioner] testified at trial that he visited \u201cMiss April\u201d later in\nthe evening on September 1, 2008, because he was sorry to\nhear that Leighton and Francis had been shot in front of her\nhouse, and that she had witnessed the shooting. [Petitioner]\nalso testified that, a few days prior to the shooting, he had a\nconversation with Leighton and Guy, while in the vehicle,\nabout a gun his cousin wanted to sell. According to\n[Petitioner], the gun he was helping his cousin sell \u201chold[s] 30\nrounds\u201d and was \u201cthe same gun that went off in the house [on]\n930 Spruce Street.\u201d [Petitioner] denied any involvement in the\n\n4\nshooting, however, and he testified that at the time of the\n\nshooting he was \u201ccooking up some drugs\u201d at 930 Spruce\n\nStreet.\nWashington v. State, 31 A.3d 77 (Table), 2011 WL 4908250, at *1-2 (Del. October 14,\n2011).\n\nB. Procedural History\n\nOn September 28, 2009, a New Castle County grand jury charged Petitioner by\nindictment with two counts of first degree murder, two counts of attempt first degree\nrobbery, two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony\n(\u2018PFDCF\u201d), and one count of possession of a firearm by a person prohibited (\u201cPFBPP\u2019).\n(D.1. 76-1 at Entry No. 1;1 D.I. 47-3 at 1-4) On November 11, 2010, a Delaware\nSuperior Court jury found Petitioner guilty of two counts of the lesser-included offense of\nmanslaughter and two counts of PFDCF. (D.1. 76-1 at Entry No. 41) The jury found\nPetitioner not guilty of the attempted robbery charges. (/d.) On February 11, 2011, the\nSuperior Court sentenced Petitioner to an aggregate of eighty-six years of imprisonment\nat Level V, suspended after sixty-six years for decreasing levels of supervision. (D.1.\n76-1 at Entry No. 48) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's conviction on\ndirect appeal. See Washington, 2011 WL 4908250, at *4.\n\nIn March 2012, Petitioner filed a pro se motion for postconviction relief pursuant\nto Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 motion (interchangeably referred to as\n\u201cRule 61 motion\u2019 or \u201cfirst Rule 61 motion\u201d). (D.1. 76-3) He filed an amended Rule 61\nmotion on August 8, 2012 (also interchangeably referred to as \u201cRule 61 motion\u201d or \u201cfirst\n\nRule 61 motion\u2019). (D.I. 47-1 at Entry No. 77) Defense counsel filed Rule 61 affidavits in\n\nresponse to Petitioner's Rule 61 motion. (D.I. 47-1 at Entry Nos. 81, 82) The State filed\na response to the Rule 61 motion on October 31, 2012. (D.1. 47-22) The Superior\nCourt appointed post-conviction counsel to represent Petitioner during his Rule 61\nproceeding. (D.I. 76-1 at Entry Nos. 99-101, 139, 140) Thereafter, the Superior Court\nsequentially appointed three substitute postconviction counsel. (D.1. 76-1 at Entry Nos.\n110, 112, 115, 120) On July 17, 2015, Petitioner's last appointed post-conviction\ncounsel concluded that there were no meritorious issues he could advocate on\nPetitioner's behalf and filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. (D.|. 76-1 at Entry No\n125) Petitioner responded to the motion withdraw, and the Superior Court ordered post-\nconviction counsel to file an affidavit outlining the work he had performed. (D.I. 76-1 at\nEntry Nos. 127, 129) Post-conviction counsel filed his letter affidavit on November 15,\n2015. (D.!. 76-1 at Entry No. 146)\n\nPetitioner requested, and was granted, an extension of time to file an amended\npro se Rule 61 motion after consulting with a private investigator. (D.|. 76-1 at Entry\nNos. 131-136, 138) Petitioner filed amendments to his Rule 61 motion in March 2016,\nwhich consisted of three new claims (also interchangeably referred to as \u201cRule 61\nmotion\u201d or \u201cfirst Rule 61 motion\u2019). (D.I. 76-1 at Entry No. 139, 140) Although the State\nwas provided an opportunity to respond to Petitioner\u2019s amendments, (D.I. 47-1 at Entry\nNo. 141), it did not file a response.\n\nOn September 27, 2016, a Superior Court Commissioner issued a report\nrecommending that Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion\u2014consisting of the original March 2012\n\nRule 61 motion and Petitioner\u2019s March 2016 amendments\u2014be denied and that post-\nconviction counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw be granted. See State v. Washington, 2016 WL\n5407852 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 27, 2016). The Superior Court adopted that Report and\nRecommendation on October 19 2016, denied Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion, and granted\npost-conviction counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. See Sate v. Washington, 2016 WL\n6248462 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, 2016), corrected Oct. 21, 2016. The Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed that decision on April 28, 2017. See Washington v. State, 164\nA.3d 56 (Table), 2017 WL 1573119 (Del. Apr. 28, 2017).\n\nPetitioner filed his original Petition for habeas relief on May 24, 2017. (D.1. 1)\nThe Court ordered the State to answer the Petition on November 7, 2017. (D.I. 16)\nOn November 21, 2017, Petitioner moved to stay these proceedings, requesting,\n\nwithout elaboration, permission to pursue a claim of \u201cactual innocence\u2019 in the state\n\ncourts in order to exhaust state remedies, and asking to compel the State to release\nevidence of out of court Jencks Act statements. (D.I. 18) On November 30, 2017,\nPetitioner moved to amend or supplement his motion to stay. (D.I. 21) On January 9,\n2018\u2014before the State\u2019s answer to Petitioner's habeas Petition was due\u2014Petitioner \u00b0\nfiled another motion to amend or supplement his Petition (D.1. 26), and the Court\nordered Respondents to respond to Petitioner\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings rather\nthan answer the habeas Petition. (D.I. 27) On January 11, 2018, the State responded to\nPetitioner\u2019s motion to stay, and Petitioner filed a habeas corpus \u201cbrief.\u201d (D.I. 28; D.I. 29)\nOn January 29, 2018, the Court denied Petitioner's motions to stay, to compel, to\nappoint counsel, and for an evidentiary hearing, and granted Petitioner's motion to\n\namend or supplement his Petition. (D.1. 31; D.l. 32) On February 21, 2018, Petitioner\nsupplemented his habeas Petition. (D.I. 34) On March 20, 2018, Petitioner filed a\nmotion for reconsideration of the Court\u2019s order denying the motion to stay. (D.I. 36) On\nOctober 22, 2018, the Court denied Petitioner's motion for reconsideration and ordered\nthe State to respond to Petitioner's amended Petition. (D.!. 43) On November 13, 2018,\nbefore the State filed its answer to Petitioner's habeas Petition, Petitioner filed a motion\nfor an evidentiary hearing and/or to stay due to newly discovered evidence. (D.I. 46)\nThe State filed an Answer on January 7, 2019. (D.I. 47-50) Petitioner filed a Reply on\nJanuary 18, 2019. (D.I. 52)\n\nOn April 30, 2019, Petitioner again moved to stay these federal proceedings\nin order to \u201cargue . . . newly discovered evidence [/.e., challenges to the reliability and\ncredibility of the State's expert ballistic witness, recantations by one of the\nState\u2019s witnesses, and newly presented witness statements] in the Superior Court in\norder to properly exhaust his remedies and avoid any procedurall] issue[s] . . . in this\ndistrict court.\u201d (D.I.57) On July 8, 2019, the Court ordered the State to respond to\n\nPetitioner's motions for an evidentiary hearing and to stay. (D.1. 59) Although the State\n\nopposed Petitioner's Motions, it \u201crespectfully requested\u201d that, if the Court did not outright\n\ndeny the motions, \u201cthe case [should] be stayed for [Petitioner] to exhaust his \u2018newly\n\ndiscovered\u2019 evidence claims in the state courts.\u201d (D.I. 60 at 18) Subsequently, on\n\nAugust 21, 2019, the Court denied Petitioner's motion for an evidentiary hearing, but\ngranted Petitioner's motion to stay the matter for Petitioner to exhaust his \u201cnewly\n\ndiscovered evidence\u201d claims in the state courts. (D.I. 64)\nOn August 30, 2019, Petitioner filed his second pro se Rule 61 motion and a\nmotion for appointment of counsel in the Superior Court. (D.I. 76-8 at 157-160, 161-\n164) On September 9, 2019, the Superior Court directed the appointment of counsel to\nrepresent Petitioner. (D.I. 76-8 at 165-167) On April 28, 2020, Petitioner filed a\ncounseled amended second Rule 61 motion, claiming that three pieces of \u201cnew\nevidence\u201d establish Petitioner's \u201cactual innocence,\u201d warranting a new trial: (1) State\nwitness Christopher Waterman recanted his testimony; (2) State witness Isaiah Fields\nwas the beneficiary of an undisclosed tacit sentence reduction agreement, resulting in a\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) violation; and (3) the State\u2019s expert ballistics\nwitness Carl Rone misled the jury by misrepresenting his credentials, and used\nunreliable and subjective methods of identification. (D.1. 76-9 at 6-67) The Superior\nCourt denied Petitioner\u2019s claims, finding that his second Rule 61 motion was\nprocedurally barred under Rule 61(i)(1) and (2) as untimely and successive, that his\nclaims regarding Fields and Rone were also procedurally defaulted under Rule 61(i)(3),\nand that Petitioner failed to establish a strong inference of actual innocence to\novercome the bars. See State v. Washington, 2021 WL 5232259, at *6-9 (Del. Super.\nCt. Nov. 9, 2021). Petitioner appealed and, on April 7, 2022, the Delaware Supreme\nCourt affirmed the Superior Court's denial of his second Rule 61 motion. See\nWashington v. State, 275 A.3d 1258 (Table), 2022 WL 1041267 (Del. Apr. 7, 2022). On\nMay 20, 2022, Petitioner filed a motion to set aside judgment under Delaware Superior\nCourt Civil Rules 60(b)(1), (3), and (6) and 55(c), asking the Superior Court to set aside\n\nits \u201cdefault\u201d judgment denying him postconviction relief and grant him a new trial, and a\nmotion to amend supplement to include a reference to Superior Court Criminal Rule\n57(d). (D.I. 76-12, 76-13) On May 24, 2022, the Superior Court deemed Petitioner's\nmotion to set aside judgment as a third Rule 61 motion, summarily dismissed the motion\nas procedurally barred, and held that Petitioner's motion to amend and supplement was\nmoot. See State v. Washington, 2022 WL 1656008, at *2-3 (Del. Super. Ct. May 24,\n2022). The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision on\nSeptember 6, 2022. See Washington v. State, 2022 WL 4088664, at *1 (Del. Sept. 6,\n2022).\n\nBefore he filed his third Rule 61 motion in the Superior Court in May 2022,\nPetitioner notified this Court on April 14, 2022 that he had competed his state post-\nconviction proceedings, and moved to amend, expand, and supplement his habeas\npetition to include \u201c3 new claims [that he] ... exhaust[ed] ... in the [state] court[s] (D.1.\n66); Petitioner filed an amended habeas petition on April 28, 2022 (D.|. 69). On May 23,\n2022, the Court lifted the stay and ordered the State to respond to the amended habeas\nPetition. (D.I. 71) Subsequently, on June 7, 2022, Petitioner supplemented his\namended habeas Petition. (D.I. 72) On June 29, 2022, the Court granted the State\u2019s\nmotion for an extension of time to respond until August 12, 2022. (D.I. 75) The State\nfiled its Answer on August 12, 2022 (D.1. 77), and Petitioner filed his Reply on August\n30, 2022. (D.I. 80)\n\nIl. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\n(AEDPA) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences . . .\n10\n\nand to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d Woodford v. Garceau,\n538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas\npetition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of\nthe Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).\nAdditionally, AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for analyzing the\nmerits of a habeas petition in order to \u201cprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure\nthat state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d Bell v.\nCone, 535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002).\nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999): Picard v.\nConnor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states, in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\nshall not be granted unless it appears that\u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the\ncourts of the State; or\n\n(B)i) there is an absence of available State corrective\n\nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such process\n\nineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of comity,\ngives \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking\none complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O'Sullivan,\n\n526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000).\n11\n\nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the\nhabeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct\nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court\nto consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005);\nCastille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised the issue on direct\nappeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted and the petitioner does\nnot need to raise the same issue again in a state post-conviction proceeding. See\nLambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and further\nstate court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the federal\ncourt will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted. See\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeett] the\ntechnical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer available);\nsee also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims, however, are\nprocedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153,\n160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state\u2019s\nhighest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the merits of the\nclaim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted\nbut procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S.\n255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims\n\nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual\n\n12\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if\nthe court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260\n(3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause for a procedural\ndefault, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor external to the defense\nimpeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier,\n477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show that\nthe errors during his trial created more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that\nthe errors worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial\nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d Id. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d then a federal court\ncan excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451\n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). The miscarriage of justice\nexception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means factual\ninnocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623\n(1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual innocence by asserting\n\u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy\neyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u2014that was not presented at trial,\u201d\nshowing that no reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Hubbard v. Pinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n2Murray, 477 U.S. at 496.\n13\nC. Standard of Review\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the\nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if\nthe state court's decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts\nbased on the evidence adduced in the trial. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see also Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn, 250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001). A\nclaim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d) if the state\ncourt decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a\nprocedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir.\n2009). The deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court's order is\nunaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011). As the Court explained in Harrington, \u201cit\nmay be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the\nabsence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d /d. at 99.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the\n\nstate court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This\npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is\nonly rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1);\n\nCampbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S.\n\n14\n322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies\nto factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2)\napplies to factual decisions).\nlll. DISCUSSION\n\nPetitioner asserts the following twenty-three Claims in his timely-filed Petition: (1)\ndefense counsel was ineffective by failing to move to suppress the out-of-court\nstatements of two State witnesses (D.I. 1 at 5; D.I. 29 at 15, 28); (2) the State engaged\nin prosecutorial misconduct by manipulating facts and misleading the jury as to the\nconditions of Christopher Waterman's federal plea agreement (D.I. 1 at 7); (3) the State\nengaged in prosecutorial misconduct by manipulating evidence and vouching for state\nwitnesses (D.1. 1 at 8; D1. 29 at 12, 14, 31); (4) the trial court committed plain error by\npermitting Detective Ciritella to testify as an expert (D.|. 1 at 10; D.I. 29 at 24, 25); (5)\n(a) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during summation; and (b) defense\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by not objecting to the misconduct (D.I. 1 at 12);\n(6) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct relating to a ballistics argument (D.I.\n1 at 14; D.I. 29 at 11); (7) (a) the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing the\nState\u2019s ballistics expert witness, Carl Rone, before Petitioner had the opportunity to view\nthe vehicle involved in the incident and cross-examine Rone; and (b) defense counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to ask certain questions while cross-examining\nRone (D.I. at 16); (8) defense counsel! provided ineffective assistance by failing to have\nDNA evidence tested (D.I. 1 at 18; D.I. 29 at 35); (9) defense counsel provided\n\nineffective assistance by failing to correct the alleged misrepresentations about\n\n15\nWaterman\u2019s federal plea agreement (D.1. 1 at 20); (10) (a) defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to object to the State\u2019s allegedly false statements of\nwitness testimony during closing; (b) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by\nfailing to object to the State\u2019s \u201cvouching\u201d and assertion of personal belieffopinion during\nclosing; and (c) defense counsel failed to perform an adversarial test that could prove\nPetitioner's innocence (D.I. 1 at 22; D.I. 29 at 13, 20, 31); (11) defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to re-call the State\u2019s ballistics expert witness (Carl\nRone) to ask questions Petitioner wanted asked after the jury viewed the vehicle\ninvolved in the shooting (D.I. 1 at 24); (12) defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by: (a) failing to perform an adversarial test that could have proven Petitioner\ninnocent; (b) discredit a witness\u2019 testimony regarding a prior bad act; and (c) failing to\nobject to Detective Ciritella testifying as an expert (D.I. 1 at 26; D.I. 29 at 18, 20, 22);\n(13) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object or move to\nsuppress evidence, which was allegedly unsupported by facts and not testified to by the\nState\u2019s expert witness (D.I. 1 at 28; D.I. 29 at 22, 28); (14) (a) defense counsel] was\nineffective for failing to disclose to [Petitioner] an alleged conflict of interest and that he\nhad a fatal illness; and (b) the trial court failed to investigate the alleged conflict of\ninterest (D.I. 1 at 30; D.1. 29 at 32); (15) postconviction counsel was ineffective for failing\nto raise Petitioner\u2019s claims, failing to investigate beyond the trial record and \u201crecover\nimperative evidence outside of the trial transcripts\u201d in order to show Petitioner\u2019s\ninnocence, failing to provide Petitioner with an investigator to help prove his innocence,\n\nfailing to properly advise Petitioner about the standard for postconviction relief and\n\n16\n\ninform Petitioner that his prosecutorial misconduct claims were procedurally barred and\nshould be raised as ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims instead, and moving to\nwithdraw from the case rather than helping to prove that trial counsel was ineffective\n(D1. 1 at 32; D.I. 29 at 10, 25; D.I. 34 at 2-9; D.1. 69 at 8, 13-14, 16); (16) defense\ncounsel was ineffective by failing to adequately cross-examine State witness Coleman\n(D.1. 29 at 17); (17) defense counsel was ineffective by failing to retain an expert on\nbehalf of the defense to perform trajectory testing of the shooting inside the vehicle (D.I.\n29 at 35); (18) defense counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate beyond the trial\nrecord and subpoena potential witnesses (D.I. 34 at 7; D.1. 29 at 12, 17, 19, 21, 30, 34,\n36); (19) defense counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a reduction in sentence (D.1.\n29 at 36); (20) appellate counsel was ineffective by filing a motion to withdraw from\nPetitioner's direct appeal (D.I. 29 at 36); (21) (a) the State committed a Brady\n\nviolation because State witness Isaiah Fields was the beneficiary of an undisclosed\ntacit sentence reduction agreement, the nondisclosure of which Petitioner claims\nviolated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights (D.I. 69 at 13-16); (b) defense\ncounsel was ineffective \u201cfor failing to protect and/or raise\u201d the alleged Brady violation\nconcerning Fields\u201d on direct appeal (D.I. 69 at 13-16; D.I. 72 at 2-5); and (c) post-\nconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the Brady violation in Petitioner's\nfirst Rule 61 motion (D.|. 69 at 13-16; D.I. 72 at 2-5); (22) (a) trial counsel was\nineffective \u201cfor failing to \u2018adequately\u2019 cross-examine State\u2019s ballistic expert witness \u2018Carl\nRone\u2019 as to his certifications\u201d and findings about the bullets and casing; and (b)\n\npostconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and raise defense\n\n17\ncounsel's ineffectiveness with respect to Carl Rone (D.I. 69 at 24, 27-28); and (23)\nPetitioner has \u201cnew evidence\u201d of his actual innocence based on Waterman\u2019s\nrecantation, Fields\u2019 allegedly undisclosed \u201ctacit\u201d sentence reduction agreement, and\nRone\u2019s qualifications and methodology (D.I. 69 at 21, 27).\n\nA. Exhausted Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims: Claims One, Five\n(b), Seven (b), Ten (a), and Eleven\n\nPetitioner presented Claims One, Five (b), Seven (b), Ten (a), and Eleven in his\nRule 61 motion. The Superior Court denied the Claims as meritless, and the Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed that decision. Therefore, Claims One, Five (b), Seven (b), Ten\n(a), and Eleven will only warrant relief if the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was\neither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\n\nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510\n(2003). Under the first Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel's\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with\nreasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel\nrendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second Strickland prong,\na petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\nerror the result would have been different.\u201d /d. at 687-96. A reasonable probability is a\n\u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d /d. at 688. A court may\nchoose to address the prejudice prong before the deficient performance prong, and may\nreject an ineffectiveness claim solely on the ground that the movant was not prejudiced.\n\n18\nSee Strickland, 466 U.S. at 668. Although not insurmountable, the Strickland standard\nis highly demanding and leads to a strong presumption that counsel's representation\nwas professionally reasonable. See id. at 689.\n\nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that the\nDelaware Supreme Court correctly identified the Strickland standard as governing\nPetitioner's instant ineffective assistance of counsel contentions. As a result, the\nDelaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law.\n\nThe Court must also determine if the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably\napplied the Strickland standard to the facts of Petitioner's case. See Harrington, 562\nU.S. at 105-06. When performing this inquiry, the Court must review the Delaware\nSupreme Court\u2019s denial of Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel allegation\nthrough a \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens. /d. \u201c[T]he question is not whether counsel's actions\nwere reasonable, [but rather], whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel\nsatisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d /d. When assessing prejudice under\nStrickland, the question is \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result would have been\ndifferent\u201d but for counsel's performance, and the \u201clikelihood of a different result must be\nsubstantial, not just conceivable.\u201d /d. And finally, when viewing a state court\u2019s\ndetermination that a Strickland claim lacks merit through the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal\nhabeas relief is precluded \u201cso long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the\n\ncorrectness of the state court's decision.\u201d /d. at 101.\n\n19\n1. Claim One\n\nPetitioner contends that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by\nfailing to move to suppress the out-of-court statements of two State witnesses: Isaiah\nFields and William Coleman. (D.I. 1 at 5; D.I. 29 at 15, 28) Both Fields and Coleman\nprovided statements to Detective Ciritella concerning Petitioner's role in the shooting of i\nFrancis and Guy, and they also testified during Petitioner's trial. See Washington, 2016\nWL 5407852, at *1, *5. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that the\nDelaware Supreme Court reasonably applied Strickland in denying this argument.\n\nDuring Petitioner\u2019s trial, Isaiah Fields testified that, while in the same prison as\nPetitioner, Petitioner told Fields that he unintentionally killed Francis and Guy with a\nMAC-10 in a robbery or drug deal that went wrong. (D.I. 47-3 at 85-88) Fields also\ntestified that he saw Petitioner accidentally fire a MAC-10 at 930 Spruce Street a few\nmonths before Francis and Guy were killed. (/d.) William Coleman testified at trial that,\nwhile he and Petitioner were in the same prison, Petitioner told Coleman that he shot\nFrancis and Guy from the back seat of a car with a MAC-10 in a robbery that went\nwrong, that he disposed of the MAC-10 used in the shooting, and that April Gardner had\nwitnessed the shooting. (D.I. 47-3 at 63-67) On cross-examination, defense counsel\nused letters that Coleman wrote to the police with this information to expose\ninconsistencies between his version of events in the letters and his trial testimony, as\nwell as his strongly expressed desire for a deal in exchange for providing information\n\nabout the shooting; the letters were admitted into evidence. (D.1. 47-3 at 67-72)\n\n20\nIn his first Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by not moving to suppress the out-of-court statements Fields and\nColeman provided to Detective Ciritella under Delaware Rule of Evidence 404 and 11\nDel. C. \u00a7 3507. (D.1. 47-28 at 2, 4; D.I. 76-3 at 7-9) The Superior Court Commissioner\nrecommended that Claim One should be denied because defense counsel \u201cwas not\ndeficient for failing to object or move to suppress Fields\u2019 or Coleman's statements \u2014\nthere was no basis to do so.\u201d Coleman, 2016 WL 5407852, at *6. As an initial matter,\n\u201cneither Fields\u2019 nor Coleman's statements were introduced pursuant to 11 Del. C. \u00a7\n3507. The only testimony the State offered thr[ough] Fields and Coleman was live, in-\ncourt testimony.\u201d Washington, 2016 WL 5407852, at *5 (emphasis added). The\nSuperior Court Commissioner explained that defense counsel had \u201cno meritorious basis\nupon which to object to [particular statements made at trial that were part] of Fields\u2019 or\nWaterman\u2019s testimony.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). The Superior Court adopted the\nCommissioner\u2019s Report, and denied Claim One. See Washington, 2016 WL 6248462,\nat *3.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's decision that\ndefense counsel did not perform deficiently, and also held that Petitioner failed to satisfy\nthe prejudice prong of Strickland. See Washington, 2017 WL 1573119, at *3. With\nrespect to Petitioner's failure to satisfy Strickland's performance prong, the Delaware\nSupreme determined that defense counsel did not have a basis to object or move to\nsuppress Fields\u2019 or Coleman's testimony under the Delaware Rules of Evidence or\n\n\u00a7 3507, because: (1) Fields\u2019 testimony about seeing Petitioner with a MAC-10, a\n\n21\n\ni\ni\n:\ni\n|\ni\n|\ni\ncandidate weapon in the shooting of Francis and Guy, was highly relevant and not\nunduly prejudicial D.R.E. 403; (2) defense counsel had no basis to object to the prior\naccidental shooting evidence under D.R.E. 404(b); (3) Fields\u2019 testimony was offered for\na proper purpose\u2014to show that Petitioner had possessed the same type of weapon\nused in the shooting, rather than his general criminal disposition; (4) Petitioner never\nidentified any prior bad acts in the letters Coleman wrote to the police, which were\nadmitted at trial; and (5) the State did not introduce Fields\u2019 and Coleman\u2019s out-of-court\nstatements to the police at trial pursuant to \u00a7 3507. See Washington, 2017 WL\n1573119, at *3.\n\nOn habeas review, the Court must defer to the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s\ninterpretation and application of Delaware\u2019s evidentiary rules. See Scott v. Johnson,\n2014 WL 4955704, at *6 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2014). Given the Delaware Supreme Court's\ndetermination that there was no meritorious basis upon which to object or move to\nsuppress the testimony, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court\nreasonably applied Strickland when holding that defense counsel did not perform\ndeficiently by failing to file a meritless motion.\n\nIn addition, Petitioner cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that the\noutcome of his proceeding would have been different but for defense counsel's failure to\neither object to, or move to suppress, Fields\u2019 and Coleman\u2019s testimony. As determined\nby the Delaware Supreme Court, \u201c[t]here was significant additional evidence presented\nat trial about [Petitioner's] role in the shooting, including Gardner's eyewitness testimony\n\nand Fields, Coleman, and Christopher Waterman\u2019s trial testimony that [Petitioner]\n\n22\nadmitted to killing Francis and Guy.\u201d Washington, 2017 WL 1573119, at *3. Given this\nrecord, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied\nStrickland in holding that Petitioner did not satisfy the prejudice-prong of Strickland.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim One.\n\n2. Claims Five (b) and Ten (a)\n\nIn Claims Five (b) and Ten (a), Petitioner contends that defense counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance by not objecting to the State's alleged misstatement of\nthe evidence during closing arguments at trial that: (1) April Gardner testified Petitioner\ngot into the back passenger side seat of the car moments before the car windows\nerupted: and (2) the State\u2019s ballistic expert, Rone, testified that, if more than one person\nhad been present in the back of the car, that person would have been shot. The\nSuperior Court denied these Claims after reviewing the trial record and finding that the\nState\u2019s assertions were reasonable extrapolations from the evidence, including\nGardner's eyewitness testimony that she saw Petitioner enter the back seat of the car\nimmediately prior to the shooting and the ballistic trajectory of evidence showing that\n\u201canyone seated on that side would have been struck by the bullets.\u201d Washington, 2016\nWL 5407852, at *7.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s denial of Claims Five\n(b) and Ten (a), explaining:\nGardner testified that she saw a car, with a man sitting in the\ndriver's seat, parked in front of her house. Gardner saw\nWashington, who she knew, and an unknown man approach\nthe car. The unknown man entered the passenger side of the\ncar while Washington sat on the steps of the house next door\nto Gardner's house. The unknown man then got out the car\n\n23\nand spoke to Washington. Gardner testified that Washington\nthen got in the back seat of the car and the unknown man got\nin the passenger side. A prosecutor may make logical\nimplications based upon the evidence presented at trial. The\nSuperior Court did not err in accepting the Commissioner's\nconclusion that it was reasonably inferable from Gardner's\ntestimony and view of the car that Washington got into the\nback passenger side of the car.\n\nAs to Rone's testimony, he testified that the shooter was\nseated in the back passenger side seat, but did not testify that\nif anyone other than the shooter had been in the back seat of\nthe car, that person would have been shot. The evidence\npresented at trial did reflect that the interior of the car was\nriddled with bullet holes. Even assuming it was not inferable\nfrom Rone's testimony that another person in the back seat\nwould have been shot,?> Washington has not pled an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim or a colorable claim of\na miscarriage of justice. The possible existence of another\nperson in the back seat with the shooter was irrelevant to the\ndefense presented at trial.\n\nAt trial, [Petitioner] testified that he was at 930 Spruce Street,\nnot the car, at the time of the shooting. He also testified he\ngave a gun that had accidentally discharged at 930 Spruce\nStreet to Gardner's then-boyfriend, who was interested in\nbuying it, the evening of the shooting. During cross-\nexamination and closing arguments, [Petitioner's] counsel\nsuggested Gardner's then-boyfriend shot Francis and Guy.\nThe possibility of another person with the shooter in the back\nseat of the car has no relevance to [Petitioner's] defense that\nhe was not present during the shooting.\n\n3The State made the following comment about Rone\u2019s testimony during closing:\n\nNow, you heard from Carl Rone ... and he told you that, in his expert\nopinion, that all the shots were fired from within the car, and he also\n-- and he also told you that they all came from the rear passenger\nseat, and that if someone else had gotten into the car and was seated\nin the passenger -- on the driver's side passenger seat, that they\nwould have been shot.\n\n(D.1. 79-4 at 100)\n24\nWashington, 2017 WL 1573119, at *5.\n\nIn order for a prosecutor's comments to amount to prosecutorial misconduct, the\ncomments must have \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting\nconviction a denial of due process.\u201d Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 180 (1986).\nWhen determining whether a prosecutor's comments are improper, the comments must\nbe viewed in the context in which they were made. See United States v. Young, 470\nU.S. 1, 11 (1985). Moreover, it is well-settled that, during closing summation, a\nprosecutor may properly comment on the evidence and all legitimate inferences which\nlogically flow therefrom. See Hughes v. State, 437 A.2d 559, 573 (Del.1981). For\ninstance, a \u201cprosecutor is permitted\u2014indeed expected\u2014to comment on the evidence\nthat was presented at trial and connect the dots for the jury by explaining what each\npiece of evidence means and how it all fits together to prove his or her case.\u201d United\nStates v. Hoffecker, 530 F.3d 137, 194 (3d Cir.2008), superseded on other grounds by\nregulation as stated in Rad v. Att'y Gen., 983 F.3d 651,668 n.13 (3d Cir. 2020).\n\nThe record reveals that the State\u2019s remarks concerning Gardner's testimony\nwere supported by the evidence. As a result, defense counsel had no reason to object\nto State\u2019s comments that were based on reasonable inferences from the evidence.\nTherefore, the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied Strickland when denying\nPetitioner's ineffective assistance allegation concerning Gardner's testimony.\n\nAlthough the Delaware Supreme Court implicitly acknowledged that the State\u2019s\ncomment about Rone\u2019s testimony constituted a reasonable extrapolation from the\n\nevidence given the number of the bullet holes in the car\u2019s interior, the Delaware\n\n25\nSupreme Court alternatively held that defense counsel's failure to object did not amount\nto ineffective assistance because the presence of another person in the back seat was\nirrelevant to defense theory that Petitioner was not in the car at the time of the\nshooting.4 Because the Delaware Supreme Court's alternate holding provides a\nsufficient basis for the Court to conduct its \u00a7 2254(d) inquiry, the Court will not address\nwhether the State\u2019s comment constituted a reasonable extrapolation from the evidence.\n\nThe record clearly demonstrates that Petitioner's theory of defense was that he\nwas not in the car when the shooting occurred. (See D.|. 79-4 at 117) Given the\ndefense theory that Petitioner was not involved at all in the shooting, the Delaware\nSupreme Court reasonably applied Strickland by holding that Petitioner failed to\ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that objecting to the State\u2019s comments about\nRone\u2019s testimony would have changed the outcome of his case.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claims Five (b) and Ten (a) for failing to satisfy \u00a7\n2254(d).\n\n3. Claims Seven (b) and Eleven\n\n\u201cDuring trial, the jury was escorted down to the courthouse sally port for a view of\nthe actual vehicle where the victims were found dead. During the jury view Washington\nwas seated nearby in a DOC van. After the jury view, Washington complained to the\n\nJudge that he could not see the vehicle from the DOC van where he had been seated.\n\n4After explaining that Rone \u201cdid not testify that if anyone other than the shooter had\nbeen in the back seat of the car, that person would have been shot,\u201d the Delaware\nSupreme Court concluded that, \u201c[e]ven assuming it was not inferable from Rone\u2019s\ntestimony that another person in the back seat would have been shot, [Petitioner] has\nnot pled an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d Washington, 2017 WL 1573119, at\n*5.\n\n26\nThe Judge then instructed the State to have the car brought back over to the\ncourthouse so Washington could view it; which he did.\u201d 2016 WL 5407852, at *8.\n\nIn Claims Seven (b) and Eleven, Petitioner asserts that defense counsel was\nineffective for not asking Rone additional questions about his findings after Petitioner\nviewed the car during trial. In his first Rule 61 motion, Petitioner stated that\n\nhe wanted the following questions asked: (1) \u201c[t]he vehicle\nwas clean[ed] out and the driver and passenger seats] was\nmovefed] up and down and back and forth prior to insertion\nof the trajectory rods[,] will that effect the opinion on where\nthe shooting may have took place,\u201d and (2) \u201c[clonsidering all\nthe impact rounds discovered within the vehicle what is the\nopinion on the possible people that could have been seated\ninside during the shooting.\u201d\n\n2016 WL 5407852, at *9 (alterations in the original).\nThe Superior Court Commissioner recommended that Petitioner's argument be\ndenied under both prongs of Strickland, stating:\n\n[Petitioner\u2019s] claim fails because he has not shown that Trial\nCounsel's performance was deficient in any way. Nor has\n[Petitioner] shown that the outcome of the trial would have\nbeen different had these specific questions been asked\u2014by\nanyone. Trial Counsel is vested with wide latitude in\nconducting cross examination and deciding what questions to\nask, or not ask. My review of the trial transcripts reveals that\nRone was subjected to a lengthy and vigorous cross\nexamination. [Petitioner's] first question is based on the\npremise that the seats in the car were moved prior to insertion\nof the trajectory rods, an assertion | can find no support for\nanywhere in the record. [Petitioner's] second question was\nactually answered by Rone. Rone testified that the shooter\nwas seated in the rear passenger side seat based on the\ntrajectory of the bullets.\n\nWashington, 2016 WL 5407852, at *98. The Superior Court subsequently adopted the\nCommissioner's Report. See Washington, 2016 WL 6248462, at *2-3. On post-\n27\nconviction appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court applied Strickland and found that trial\ncounsel did not perform deficiently and that Petitioner did not show a reasonable\nprobability of a different outcome if counsel had asked the questions Petitioner now\nraises, noting:\n\nAfter [Petitioner] viewed the car [during the trial] and the\n\nSuperior Court asked him if there was anything else he\n\nneeded with respect to the car and his case, he responded in\n\nthe negative. [Petitioner's] counsel had already subjected\n\nRone to extensive cross examination and did not have any\n\nfurther questions. [D.1. 47-3 at 175-76].\nWashington, 2017 WL 1573119, at *6.\n\nAn attorney's decision regarding the cross-examination of witnesses is strategic\nin nature and will not constitute the basis for ineffective assistance if the decision was\nreasonably made. See Revel v. Pierce, 66 F. Supp. 3d 517, 527 (D. Del. 2014). Here,\nthe record reflects that defense counsel extensively and vigorously cross-examined\nRone and did not have any further questions. See Washington, 2017 WL 1573119,\nat*6. The Delaware Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply Strickland, when, as\nsummarized above, it found no deficient performance or prejudice to Petitioner. See\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688; Glass v. Sec\u2019y Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr., 726 F. App\u2019x\n930, 933 (3d Cir. 2018) (\u201c[T]rial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to\npursue meritless arguments.\u201d); see also Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 382 (1993).\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court also reasonably found that Petitioner could not\n\nestablish any prejudice under Strickland. The evidence against Petitioner was\n\n28\n\noverwhelming,\u00ae and Petitioner failed to show a reasonable probability that the outcome\nof his trial would have been different if the two questions had been asked.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes the Delaware Supreme Court\nreasonably applied the Strickland standard to Claims Seven (b) and Eleven.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny these Claims.\n\nB. Procedurally Barred Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims\n\nThe record reveals that Petitioner did not include the following ineffective\nassistance of counsel Claims in his Rule 61 motion or present them to the Delaware\nSupreme Court on post-conviction appeal: Claims Eight, Nine, Ten (b), (c), Twelve (b),\n(c), Thirteen, Fourteen (a), Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty, Twenty-\nOne (b), and Twenty-Two (a). Because Petitioner failed to fairly present these twelve\nClaims to the Delaware state courts and any attempt to raise them now would be time-\nbarred or barred as successive,\u00ae the Claims are procedurally defaulted.\n\nAdditionally, although Petitioner presented Claim Twelve (a) to the Delaware\n\nSupreme Court on post-conviction appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed the\n\n5See supra at Section II_A.1; see infra at Sections III.B.2, III.B.4, and n.11.\n\nSAny attempt by Petitioner to raise these Claims in a new Rule 61 motion would be\nbarred as untimely under Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(1) and as\nsuccessive under Rule 61(i)(2). See Parker v. DeMatteis, 2021 WL 3709733, at *6 (D.\nDel. Aug. 20, 2021). Although Rule 61 provides for an exception to its procedural bars if\na Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a retroactively applicable right that is newly recognized after\nthe judgment of conviction is final,\u201d no such right is implicated in the instant Claims.\nSimilarly, the exceptions to Rule 61 bars contained in Rule 61(i)(5) and (d)(2) do not\napply to Petitioner's case, because he does not allege actual innocence, lack of\njurisdiction, or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to Claims Eight, Nine, Ten\n(b), Twelve (b) and (c), Thirteen, Fourteen, Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen,\nTwenty, Twenty-One (b) and Twenty-Two (a).\n\n29\n\nClaim for plain error under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8 because Petitioner did not\npresent it to the Superior Court in his Rule 61 motion. By explicitly applying the plain\nerror doctrine to Claim Twelve (a), the Delaware Supreme Court articulated a \u201cplain\nstatement\u201d under Harris v. Reed that its decision rested on state law grounds. See\nHarris, 489 U.S. at 263-64. In turn, Delaware's plain error doctrine constitutes an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rule for procedural default purposes. See\nCampbell v. Burris, 515 F.3d 172, 177-82 (3d Cir. 2008). Thus, Claim Twelve (a) is\nprocedurally defaulted.\n\nSince Claims Eight, Nine, Ten (b) and (c), Twelve (a), (b), and (c), Thirteen,\nFourteen (a), Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty, Twenty-One (b), and\nTwenty-Two (a) are procedurally defaulted, the Court cannot review the merits of the\nClaims absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or a miscarriage of justice. Petitioner\nattempts to establish cause for his default under Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012),\nby arguing that his post-conviction counsel provided ineffective assistance by not raising\nthese Claims in his initial Rule 61 proceeding.\u2019 In Martinez, the Supreme Court held\nthat inadequate assistance of counsel during an initial-review state collateral proceeding\nmay (under certain circumstances) establish cause for a petitioner's procedural default\nof a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See Martinez, 566 U.S. at 12, 16-17.\n\nSpecifically, a petitioner must demonstrate that the post-conviction attorney in his first\n\n7Petitioner asserts that post-conviction counsel provided ineffective assistance by\nmoving to withdraw from his Rule 61 proceeding and not raising these Claims, and also\nby failing to inform him that he should raise the prosecutorial misconduct claims as\nineffective assistance of counsel claims to avoid Rule 61\u2019s procedural bars. (D.I. 1 at\n18-23, 26-31; D.I. 29 at 6-7; D.1. 34 at 2-3; D.I. 69 at 16, 20-23; D.1. 72)\n\n30\ncollateral proceeding was ineffective under the Strickland standard (or that petitioner\nwas not provided with representation), the underlying ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim is substantial (i.e., has \u201csome merit\u2019), and the petitioner was prejudiced. See\nMartinez, 566 U.S. at 14-17. The Third Circuit has explained the application of Martinez\nin habeas cases:\n\nMartinez recognizes a narrow exception to the doctrine of\n\nprocedural default: Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-\n\nreview collateral proceedings may establish cause for a\n\nprisoner's procedural default of a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance at trial. This exception is available to a petitioner\n\nwho can show that: 1) his procedurally defaulted ineffective\n\nassistance of trial counsel claim has \u201csome merit,\u201d and that 2)\n\nhis state-post conviction counsel was ineffective under the\n\nstandards of Strickland v. Washington.\nWorkman v. Sup't Albion SCI, 915 F.3d 928, 937 (3d Cir. 2019). In other words,\npursuant to Workman, a petitioner need only show that the underlying ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim is substantial (i.e., has \u201csome merit\u201d) to demonstrate the\nprejudice prong of Strickland. See id. at 938-39. \u201cTo demonstrate that his claim has\nsome merit, a petitioner must \u2018show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for\nthat matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or\nthat the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed\nfurther.\u201d /d. at 938 (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003)). To\ndemonstrate that post-conviction counsel's ineffectiveness caused the procedural\ndefault, a petitioner must show that post-conviction counsel's performance was deficient\n\nunder the first prong of the Strickland standard, i.e., \u201cthat his state post-conviction\n\ncounsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Workman,\n\n31\n915 F.3d at 941. Notably, the Martinez-exception for procedural default is limited to\nunderlying ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims, and does not apply to\nunderlying ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims. See Davila v. Davis, 137\nS.Ct. 2058, 2068 (2017) (noting that the equitable concerns of Martinez do not apply to\nclaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because state had made a\ndeliberate choice to move ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims outside of the\ndirect appeal process where counsel is not constitutionally guaranteed, but ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel claims could never have been raised during the direct\nappeal process).\n\n1. Martinez, cause, and post-conviction counsel\u2019s actions with\n\nrespect to Claims Twelve (b), Thirteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, and\nTwenty\nPetitioner has failed to demonstrate that post-conviction counsel's actions excuse\n\nhis default of Claims Twelve (b), Thirteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, and Twenty under the\nlimited exception recognized in Martinez. After post-conviction counsel moved to\nwithdraw from representing Petitioner during his first Rule 61 proceeding, Petitioner\nraised the ineffective assistance of trial counsel arguments set forth in Claims Twelve\n(b), Thirteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, and Twenty in the Rule 61 motion, but he\nsubsequently voluntarily withdrew the Claims from the Superior Court\u2019s consideration.\n(See D.1.47-26 at 2); see also Washington, 2016 WL 5407852, at *4 (noting that\nPetitioner requested that court ignore certain issues raised in the original Rule 61\nmotion). Because Petitioner expressly withdrew Claims Twelve (b), Thirteen,\n\nSeventeen, Eighteen, and Twenty from the Superior Court\u2019s consideration, post-\n\n32\nconviction counsel's failure to raise these Claims cannot constitute cause for Petitioner's\ndefault. See Kellum v. Pierce, 24 F. Supp. 3d 390, 405 (D. Del. 2014).\n\nAdditionally, the Court notes that Claim Fifteen\u2014which independently and\nseparately alleges that post-conviction counsel was ineffective for not helping to prove\nPetitioner's actual innocence and for moving to withdraw from representing Petitioner\nduring his first Rule 61 proceeding\u2014cannot provide cause for Petitioner's default of\nClaims Twelve (b), Thirteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, and Twenty. An allegation of\nineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel can only establish cause for a default\nwhen the underlying claim alleges the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See\nDavila, 137 S.Ct. at 2062.\n\nIn sum, Martinez does not excuse Petitioner's default of Claims Twelve (b),\nThirteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, and Twenty.\n\n2. Martinez, cause, and the \u201csubstantiality\u201d of Claims Eight, Nine,\nTen (b) & (c), Twelve (a) & (c), Fourteen (a), Sixteen, Nineteen,\nTwenty-One (b), and Twenty-Two (a)\n\nPetitioner also cannot establish cause under Martinez for his default of Claims\nEight, Nine, Ten (b) and (c), Twelve (a) and (c), Fourteen (a), Sixteen, Nineteen,\nTwenty-One (b), and Twenty-Two (a) because, for the reasons set forth below, he has\nfailed to demonstrate that the underlying ineffective assistance of trial counsel\narguments are substantial.\n\na. Claim Eight\nPetitioner's argument that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by not\n\nhaving the evidence that was collected from the victims\u2019 vehicle tested for DNA is \u201cnot\n\n33\nsubstantial\u201d for the purposes of the Martinez exception. \u201cTrial management is the\nlawyer's province: Counsel provides his or her assistance by making decisions such as\nwhat arguments to pursue, what evidentiary objections to raise, and what agreements to\nconclude regarding the admission of evidence.\u201d McCoy v. Louisiana, 138 S.Ct. 1500,\n1508 (2018). Witness selection is one of the \u201cnon-fundamental decisions that counsel is\nentitled to make at trial.\u201d Gov\u2019t of the Virgin Islands v. Weatherwax, 77 F.3d 1425, 1434\n(3d Cir. 1996). Notably, effective assistance does not demand that every possible\nmotion be filed, but only those having a solid foundation.\u201d United States v. Swinehart,\n617 F.2d 336, 341 (3d Cir. 1980). In his responsive Rule 61 affidavit to Petitioner's\ninitial pro se Rule 61 motion filed on March 7, 2012,8 defense counsel explained that\n\n[aJn independent defense DNA expert would not have been\nable to reasonably be of value to the defense of the case in\nlight of other evidence and testimony presented by the State.\nThe State\u2019s pathologist indicated that DNA profiles matching\nthe decedents, [Petitioner], and unknown third parties were\nrecovered from the vehicle. Because of the inherent nature\nof a vehicle used for personal purposes, it is not surprising\nthat additional DNA was recovered from the vehicle. Counsel\nmade the informed decision that presentation of an\nindependent DNA expert would merely cumulate the DNA\ntestimony presented by the State and confuse the issues for\nthe jury.\n\n(D.1. 47-20 at 25-26)\n\nPetitioner raised Claim Eight in his Memorandum supporting the initial pro se Rule 61\nmotion he filed on March 7, 2012. (D.1. 47-19 at 10) Defense counsel filed an affidavit\nresponding to the allegations in Petitioner's March 7, 2012 Rule 61 motion, and\nspecifically responded to Claim Eight. (D.1. 47-20 at 25-26) Petitioner did not include\nClaim Eight in the amended Rule 61 motion he filed after post-conviction counsel filed a\nmotion to withdraw. See Washington, 2016 WL 5407852, at *4. Thus, the Court also\nconcludes that Martinez does not apply to excuse Petitioner's default of Claim Eight\nbecause he knowingly and intentionally failed to include the Claim for the Superior\nCourt\u2019s consideration. See supra at Section IIi.B.1.\n\n34\nMoreover, Petitioner fails to demonstrate how the absence of DNA testing of the\nitems collected from the victims\u2019 vehicle resulted in prejudice. The jury was advised that\nthe parties stipulated that \u201citems were tested for possible DNA analysis\u201d and \u201c[nJone of\nthe items tested produced a conclusive match to any particular individual.\u201d (D.1. 47-3 at\n33, 173) The lack of DNA and fingerprint evidence tying Petitioner to the car supported\nhis defense that he was not in the car at the time of the shooting. See Washington,\n2017 WL 1573119, at *5; (D.|. 47-3 at 173, 296, 304) For these reasons, the Court\nconcludes that Martinez cannot be used to excuse Petitioner's default of Claim Eight\nbecause the underlying ineffective assistance counsel argument contained therein is not\nsubstantial.\n\nb. Claim Nine\n\nDuring summation, the State highlighted the \u201cfact that that Waterman was not\ngiven any type of specific promise or deal for his testimony,\u201d but also acknowledged that\nWaterman \u201ccould avoid a substantial amount of jail time by cooperating and that he was\nrequired to testify truthfully.\u201d Washington, 2016 WL 5407852, at *6. In Claim Nine,\nPetitioner contends that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to\nobject to the alleged misrepresentation by the State concerning Waterman's federal\nplea agreement.\n\nThe record supports the State\u2019s assertion that Waterman\u2019s plea agreement did\nnot contain any promise or deal for his testimony. (D.1. 47-25 at 2-3) Additionally,\nduring cross-examination, defense counsel thoroughly explored Waterman\u2019s plea\n\nagreement, cooperation, possible sentence, and motivation for testifying. (D.I. 47-3 at\n\n35\n50-56) And finally, when addressing Petitioner's corresponding Rule 61 claim that the\nState engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by misrepresenting or mischaracterizing the\nevidence regarding the plea agreement (Claim Two in this proceeding), the Superior\nCourt Commissioner held that Petitioner did not demonstrate prejudice to overcome the\ndefault of his prosecutorial default, finding that \u201c[njothing the prosecutor said during her\nsummation was in any way a manipulation or mischaracterization of the evidence\nregarding the plea agreement.\u201d Washington, 2016 WL 5407852, at *6. Given these\ncircumstances, Claim Nine\u2019s assertion of ineffective assistance is not substantial and\ncannot provide cause for Petitioner's default.\n\nc. Claims Ten (b), (c) and Twelve (a)\n\nIn Claims Ten (b), (c) and Twelve (a), Petitioner asserts that defense counsel\nwas ineffective for failing to: (a) object to the prosecutor's \u201cvouching\u201d and \u201cpersonal\nopinion [during closing] on how many people [were] seated inside the backseat [of\nthe] vehicle during the shooting,\u201d and (b) perform an \u201cadversarial test of the evidence\nthat could have prove[n] [Petitioner\u2019s] innocence\u201d and discredited Fields\u2019 testimony\nregarding [Petitioner's] \u201calleged prior bad act\u201d of shooting a weapon. (D.I. 1 at 22, 26;\nD.I. 29 at 13, 20, 31)\n\nWith respect to defense counsel's failure to object to the State\u2019s alleged\nvouching, the evidence presented at trial showed that the two victims sat in the front of\nthe vehicle while the shooter sat in the back passenger side seat. See Washington,\n2017 WL 1573119, at *5; see also (D.I. 47-3 at 155). The evidence also showed that\n\nthe car\u2019s interior was riddled with bullet holes. See Washington, 2017 WL 1573119, at\n\n36\n\n*5; see also (D.|. 47-3 at 153-55) During closing, the State asserted that Rone, the\nState\u2019s ballistics expert, testified that there could not have been any other individual in\nthe back seat of the vehicle when the murder occurred. (D.I. 79-4 at 100) Despite his\ninstant complaint regarding defense counsel\u2019s representation, Petitioner has failed to\ndemonstrate that defense counsel had a factual basis for objecting to this statement.\nDuring the course of the expert\u2019s testimony, the State presented over 22 photographs of\nbullet holes in the vehicle and asked the ballistics expert to describe to the jury what\neach photograph depicted and to explain the path of the bullets. (D.1. 47-3 at 153-155)\nAdditionally, the jury was permitted to view the vehicle in which the victims were shot\nand observe the bullet holes of that vehicle. (D.I. 47-3 at 166) Rone based his\nopinion\u2014which was presented to the jury\u2014on the aforementioned evidence. The\ntestimony provided during the trial demonstrates that the statement made during the\nState\u2019s closing was a legitimate argument based on the evidence. Moreover,\nPetitioner's defense at trial was that he was not present at the shooting. Therefore, the\npossible existence of another person in the back seat with the shooter was irrelevant to\nhis defense. See Washington, 2017 WL 1573119, at *5.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Petitioner's instant contention\nconcerning defense counsel's failure to object to the State\u2019s comment during closing\nabout the number of individuals in the back seat lacks is not \u201csubstantial\u201d under\nMartinez.\n\nPetitioner's complaint about defense counsel's failure to perform an adversarial\n\ntest of the evidence that could have proved his innocence and could have discredited\n\n37\n\nFields\u2019 testimony regarding Petitioner\u2019s alleged prior bad act of shooting a weapon also\nfails to assert a substantial ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Petitioner argues\nthat defense counsel should have performed trajectory testing to reconstruct the path of\nthe projectiles at 930 Spruce Street. The trajectory of the shots was not at issue. In\naddition, Detective Ciritella testified that he found patched-up bullet holes in 930 Spruce\nStreet's living room wall, as Fields indicated he would, and another officer testified that\ntwo of the bullets, which were given to Rone to test, were found in that wall. (D.!. 47-3\nat 95-97, 128) While cross-examining Fields, defense counsel effectively exposed\ninconsistencies between Fields\u2019 prior version of events and his trial testimony regarding\nthe accidental shooting at 930 Spruce Street. (D.I. 47-3 at 89-91) Moreover, as the\nSuperior Court Commissioner recognized, the fact that Petitioner had possessed a\nfirearm or that it accidentally \u201cwent off\u2019 was not, by itself, a \u201cbad act.\u201d Washington, 2016\nWL 5407852, at *5.\n\nFurther, defense counsel was not ineffective because Petitioner's own\ntestimony tied the gun used at 930 Spruce Street to the gun used in the homicides.\nSpecifically, Petitioner testified at trial that while present at 930 Spruce Street, he\nobserved Fields with this firearm \u201clooking at it, . . . playing with it back and forth and the\ngun just went off in the floor into the wall.\u201d (D.I. 76-5 at 90) Petitioner also testified,\n\u201cnext time | seen that gun was the day of the shooting accident.\u201d (D.I. 47-3 at 196)\nPetitioner testified that on that date\u2014September 15t\u2014he gave the gun to Kareem Bay\nwho was interested in buying it. (D.I. 47-3 at 196-97)\n\nFinally, the significant additional evidence presented at trial of Petitioner's\n\n38\n\nguilt forecloses Petitioner's ability to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the\noutcome of his trial would have been different but for defense counsel's failure to object\nand perform trajectory testing. Gardner provided eyewitness testimony that she saw\nPetitioner get into the back seat of the car and watched the windows explode\nimmediately thereafter. Fields, Coleman, and Waterman testified that Petitioner\nadmitted to killing Francis and Guy. (D.|. 47-3 at 48-50, 63-67, 73-76, 85-88) For all of\nthese reasons, the Court concludes that Claims Ten (b), (c) and Twelve (a) are not\nsubstantial and, therefore, do not excuse Petitioner's default.\n\nd. Claim Twelve (c)\n\nIn Claim Twelve (c), Petitioner asserts that defense counsel was ineffective for\nnot objecting to Detective Ciritella testifying as an expert about the bullets and bullet\nholes he found at 930 Spruce Street without performing a \u201cscientific trajectory test\u201d to\ndetermine where the shooting took place. (D.I. 1 at 26; D.1 29 at 18, 20 22) Petitioner\nalso argues that Detective Ciritella\u2019s testimony improperly vouched for Fields\u2019 credibility\nregarding where the gun was shot.\n\nContrary to Petitioner's assertion, Detective Ciritella did not testify as a ballistics\nexpert. Rather, Detective Ciritella testified about the evidence he found while executing\na search warrant at 930 Spruce Street. (D.1. 47-3 at 95-97) Fields stated that he was\nwith Petitioner a few months before the homicides and had observed Petitioner with a\nMac-10 handgun, which was the candidate murder weapon. (D.1. 47-3 at 86-87) Fields\ntold Detective Ciritella that, while Petitioner was \u201cplaying with [the gun], it went off,\u201d and\n\nthat the police might find bullet holes in a wall at 930 Spruce Street, which would be\n\n39\neasily identified by patches. (/d.) Based upon this information, Detective Ciritella\nobtained a search warrant and located patched-up bullet holes in a wall in the house,\nand also in the house\u2019s floor and basement wall. (D.I. 47-3 at 95-97) The State\u2019s\nballistic expert, Rone, testified that three bullets collected by Detective Ciritella at the\nhouse were fired from the same firearm as the murder weapon. (D.I. 47-3 at 151)\nBecause Detective Ciritella did not provide expert testimony, defense counsel cannot be\nfaulted by not objecting on that basis.\n\nFurther, as discussed above, Petitioner fails to demonstrate that defense counsel\nwas ineffective by not performing trajectory testing to reconstruct the projectiles\u2019\npath at 930 Spruce Street, or that the absence of trajectory testing prejudiced him.\nAny inconsistencies between Fields\u2019 prior version of events and his trial\ntestimony were exposed by defense counsel on cross-examination. (D.I. 47-3 at 89-91)\n\nFinally, given the significant other evidence presented at trial of Petitioner's\nguilt\u2014Gardner's eyewitness testimony and the testimony provided by Fields,\nWaterman, and Coleman\u2014Petitioner cannot show a reasonable probability of a different\noutcome. (D.1. 47-3 at 48-50, 63-67, 73-76, 85-88) Thus, Claim Twelve (c) is not\nsubstantial under Martinez.\n\ne. Claim Fourteen (a)\n\nIn Claim Fourteen (a), Petitioner argues that defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to investigate and disclose a conflict of interest prior to trial and by\nfailing to disclose his terminal illness. (D.I. 1 at 30; D.1. 29 at 32) According to\n\nPetitioner, defense counsel was aware that he had a \u201cdeadly disease\u201d and only had\n\n40\nmonths to live prior to his trial, and such information was \u201cimperative\u201d for Petitioner a\ndetermination whether defense counsel was physically, mentally, and emotionally stable\nto represent him and that medication could have impaired defense counsel's judgment.\n(Id.) Petitioner also contends that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to disclose\nthat he had a personal relationship with the prosecutor and that the prosecutor used to\nwork for him prior to being an attorney. (/d.)\n\nThese arguments are insubstantial and do not establish cause under Martinez.\nFirst, defense counsel died in 2012,\u00b0 years after Petitioner's trial, and his death alone\ndoes not support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See United States v.\nLampton, 1995 WL 33676, at *3 (E.D. La. Jan. 27, 1995) (\u201cThe fact that defense\ncounsel died some period of months after sentencing does not in and of itself support a\nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d); Hayes v. Bowersox, 2016 WL 6590871, at\n*414 (E.D. Mo. Feb. 18, 2016) (\u201cA lack of evidence as to counsel's health at trial cannot\ngive rise to a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d); United States v. Stutson, 541\nF. App\u2019x 893 (10th Cir. 2013) (agreeing with district court\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\nfailed to show prejudice from trial counsel's failure to inform him that he suffered from\nterminal brain cancer); Yarrington v. U.S., 2013 WL 2155501, at *3 (C.D. Ill. May 17,\n2013) (concluding that petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was without\nmerit where petitioner argued that counsel had a duty and obligation to advise him of his\nterminal illness). Second, conclusory allegations of a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d based upon\n\ndefense counsel's friendship with the prosecutor do not support a claim for ineffective\n\n\u00b0See https:/Awww.legacy.com/us/obituaries/delawareonline/name/peter-letang-\n\nobituary?id=19008577\n41\n\nassistance of counsel. See Boughner v. Johnson, 1996 WL 534867, at *2 (D. Del. Sept.\n\n11, 1996); State v. Wilkerson, 2016 WL 795978, at *8, 13 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 26,\n2016) (rejecting defendant's claim that defense counsel's alleged friendship with\nprosecutor was conflict of interest). Nothing in the record shows any incapacity or\nimpropriety of defense counsel. Petitioner has not shown how defense counsel's\nmedical condition or personal relationship with the prosecutor caused defense counsel\nto perform deficiently or that his condition or friendship with the prosecutor prejudiced\n\nPetitioner. See Hayes, 2016 WL 659081, at *14-15; McDougall v. Rice, 685 F. Supp.\n\n532, 539-40 (W.D.N.C. 1988); accord, Young v. Zant, 727 F.2d 1489, 1492-93 (11th Cir.\n\n1984) (Petitioner's observation that counsel ingested drugs during trial and counsel\u2019s\nadmission of his drug problem in another proceeding do not automatically support a\nclaim of ineffectiveness); Hernandez v. Wainwright, 634 F. Supp. 241, 245 (S.D. Fla.\n1986) (petitioner's claims that counsel was an alcoholic and had alcohol on his breath\nduring trial were not enough to constitute a per se Sixth Amendment violation; instead,\npetitioner had to show how the condition caused counsel to render deficient legal\nrepresentation which resulted in prejudice). Therefore, Petitioner's instant ineffective\nassistance of counsel allegations are insubstantial and cannot excuse his default of\nClaim Fourteen.\nf. Claim Sixteen\nIn Claim Sixteen, Petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to effectively\n\ncross-examine State witness Coleman about Petitioner never personally admitting\n\n42\nto him that April Gardner had witnessed the shooting. (D.I. 29 at 17) It is well-settled\nthat an otherwise reasonable decision by counsel not to call certain witnesses is not\nineffective simply because it differed from the defendant's wishes. See, e.g., Diggs v.\nOwens, 833 F.2d 439, 445-46 (3d Cir.1987). Here, Petitioner fails to allege facts\nshowing that trial counsel's actions were deficient. The record shows that Coleman\ntestified at trial that Petitioner personally told him that: (a) he shot the victims from the\nback seat of a car with a MAC-10 during a robbery; (b) he had disposed of the MAC-10\nused in the shooting; and (c) April Gardner had witnessed the shooting. (See D.I. 47-3\nat 63-67) Defense counsel conducted a thorough and vigorous cross-examination of\nColeman and used the letters Coleman wrote to the police to expose inconsistencies\nbetween the version of events in his letters and his trial testimony, as well as eliciting\nColeman\u2019s desire for a deal in exchange for providing information about the shooting.\n(See D.I. 47-3 at 67-73)\n\nPetitioner also cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome of\nhis case would have been different but for defense counsel's failure to cross-examine\nColeman in the manner Petitioner wished he had. Once again, as previously discussed,\nthere was overwhelming evidence presented at trial against Petitioner. (D.1. 47-3 at 48-\n50, 63-67, 73-76, 85-88)\n\nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that the instant allegation of ineffective\n\nassistance is insubstantial and cannot provide cause for Petitioner's default.\n\n43\ng. Claim Nineteen\n\nin Claim Nineteen, Petitioner argues that defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to seek a reduction in his sentence. Petitioner, however, proffers\nno valid legal basis upon which defense counsel should have moved to reduce his\nsentence. (See D.|. 29 at 36) Therefore, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that\nClaim Nineteen is substantial for the purposes of fitting within Martinez\u2019s limited\nexception to the procedural default doctrine.\n\nh. Claim Twenty-One (b)\n\nIn Claim Twenty-One (b), Petitioner contends that defense counsel was\nineffective for failing to \u201cprotect and/or raise\u201d on direct appeal the \u201cnew\u201d evidence that\nthe State committed a Brady violation by not disclosing at the time of Petitioner's trial\nthat Fields was the beneficiary of a tacit sentence reduction agreement. (D.I. 69 at 13)\nThe Martinez rule only provides a method for avoiding the procedural default of an\nineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, not a claim alleging the ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel. Therefore, Petitioner has not established cause for his\ndefault of Claim Twenty-One (b).\n\ni. Claim Twenty-Two (a)\n\nIn Claim Twenty-Two (a), Petitioner contends that defense counsel was\nineffective for failing to \u201cadequately\u201d cross-examine Rone as to his \u201ccertifications\u201d or\n\u201cfindings about the bullets and casings.\u201d (D.1. 69 at 24, 27) Petitioner asserts that\n\ndefense counsel conceded that Rone was an expert and stipulated to his qualifications\n\n44\n\ninstead of cross-examining him as to his \u201clapsed credentials,\u201d which he contends would\nhave prevented the jury from seeing or hearing about the physical evidence he tested.\n(D.I. 69 at 24-27) Additionally, Petitioner alleges that Rone\u2019s methodology as to the\nphysical evidence in this case was \u201cerroneous,\u201d and \u201cnew evidence . . . proves\nCarl Rone\u2019s testing was insufficient, unreliable, and he shouldn't [have] been\ntestifying as an expert witness.\u201d (D.|. 69 at 20, 27) Petitioner also notes that\nRone was charged and convicted for falsifying business records in 2016. (D.I. 69 at 27)\nThe Superior Court rejected the same underlying argument when it denied\nPetitioner's second Rule 61 motion. As the Delaware Superior Court recognized,\nRone\u2019s testimony connecting the firearm used at 930 Spruce to the one used in the\nhomicides was not crucial in determining guilt because Petitioner, whose own testimony\nestablished the connection, did not contest the ballistics match. See Washington, 2021\nWL 5232259, at *7-8. Furthermore, the verdicts of manslaughter reveal that the jury\nrejected the only opinion of Rone\u2019s that Petitioner contested\u2014that the murder weapon\nwas a semi-automatic weapon requiring a separate trigger pull for each shot. Separate\ntrigger pulls would have indicated intentional first degree murders, while an automatic\nweapon, requiring only a single trigger pull, could manifest recklessness. /d. In\naddition, since Delaware courts previously found that Rone qualified as an expert in\nfirearms and toolmark identification under D.R.E 702 in several earlier trials in\nDelaware, Petitioner cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that a challenge to\nRone\u2019s credentials in his case would have been productive. See Phillips, 2015 WL\n\n5168253, at *3-4. To the extent Petitioner relies on Rone\u2019s subsequent convictions for\n\n45\nfalsifying records, defense counsel could not have known about Rone\u2019s misconduct that\nhe committed years after Petitioner's trial. See Dooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891\n(3d Cir. 1987) (\u201cclairvoyance is not required of effective trial counsel.\u201d).\n\nMoreover, Petitioner cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would\nnot have been convicted but for defense counsel's failure to cross-examine Rone in the\nmanner wished by Petitioner. Rone\u2019s testimony was not critical; this was not a close\ncase and there was overwhelming evidence, independent of Rone\u2019s testimony,\npresented at trial against Petitioner. (D.1. 47-3 at 48-50, 63-67, 73-76, 85-88) Thus,\nPetitioner's instant allegation of defense counsel's ineffective assistance cannot provide\ncause for his default because the allegation is insubstantial.\n\n3. Absence of cause and prejudice\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that Petitioner has failed to\ndemonstrate cause for his default of Claims Eight, Nine, Ten (b) and (c), Twelve (a), (b),\nand (c), Thirteen, Fourteen (a), Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty,\nTwenty-One (b), and Twenty-Two (a). Given the absence of cause, the Court will not\naddress the issue of prejudice.\n\n4, Miscarriage of justice\n\nFinally, Petitioner contends that his procedural default of the instant thirteen\nineffective assistance of counsel Claims should be excused, and their merits reviewed,\nin order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. In support of this contention, Petitioner\nasserts that he is \u201cactually innocent,\u201d as demonstrated by the following \u201cnew\u201d evidence:\n\n(1) State witness Christopher Waterman recanted his testimony (2) State witness\n\n46\nIsaiah Fields was the beneficiary of an undisclosed tacit sentence reduction agreement,\nresulting in a Brady violation; (3) the State's expert ballistics witness, Carl Rone, used\nunreliable methods and misled the jury by misrepresenting his credentials; and (4)\ninmate Jeree Richardson submitted an exculpatory affidavit. (See D.!. 29 at 6-7; D.I. 34\nat 10; D.I. 46 at 11; D.I. 57 at 1; D.I. 69 at 9, 17, 20-21, 27; D.I. 70 at 2-3 of 3; D.I. 72\n\nat 2)\n\nIn order to establish a miscarriage of justice, Petitioner must provide new reliable\nevidence of his actual innocence that was not presented at trial and that proves that no\nreasonable juror would have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nSchlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1995); House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 536-37 (2006).\nFor the reasons set forth below, Petitioner cannot satisfy this threshold showing of\nactual innocence.\n\na. Waterman\u2019s \u201crecantation\u201d\n\nPetitioner asserts that there is a \u201creasonable probability that he is innocent,\u201d\nbecause Waterman has recanted his testimony. (D.I. 34 at 8) In support of this\nargument, Petitioner offers an unsworn July 2017 affidavit from Waterman asserting that\n\u201ceverything that [he] testified to against [Petitioner] at his trial was a total complete lie;\u201d\n(2) Petitioner \u201cnever admitted to shooting or killing anyone personally to [him];\u201d (3) he\n\u201chonestly provided the prosecution and law enforcement with rumors and information\nthat [he] heard from other inmates about [Petitioner] . . . and [he] made [his] statements\nappear as if [his] information directly came from [Petitioner] admitting to a double\n\nhomicide and the things [he] testified to at his trial;\u201d and (4) he lied at [Petitioner's] trial\n\n47\nin order to get a reduction in his sentence for federal weapon charges in exchange for\nhis cooperation. (See D.I. 34 at 16-18)\nIn his second Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that Waterman\u2019s recantation\ncreated a strong inference that he is \u201cactually innocent.\u201d (D.I. 76-9 at 20-21). The\nSuperior Court rejected Petitioner's contention, explaining:\n\nDelaware courts generally view applications based on a\nwitness\u2019 recantation with suspicion. The Delaware Supreme\nCourt has held also that if recantations were \u201cproducts of\nprison atmosphere [they are] to be received with great\ncaution.\u201d\n\nHere, [Petitioner] asserts that Waterman's recantation of his\ntestimony would \u201clikely\u201d change the outcome of the judgment.\nWaterman signed an affidavit stating his testimony was false\nand that [Petitioner] never admitted committing the killings to\nhim. Further, Waterman states that he made up this testimony\nto get a sentence reduction for his prison term. Waterman\nclaims his false testimony was based on rumors and the\nconversations of other inmates.\n\nWaterman's recantation would not \u201cprobably change the result\nif a new trial is granted[.J\u201d Waterman testified during trial that\n[Petitioner] admitted guilt to him personally, but in Waterman's\naffidavit he states that he heard from other inmates that\nWashington committed the crime. Waterman's recantation\nmust be viewed with suspicion. But even if the Court were to\naccept it at face value, it does not provide new evidence that\na person other than [Petitioner] committed the crime, nor does\nit establish that no reasonable jury would have found\n[Petitioner] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Far from ;\nestablishing that someone other than [Petitioner] committed\nthe crimes, it shows that [Petitioner] was rumored to be the |\nkiller. If Waterman's affidavit is to be believed, it merely\neliminates him as a witness, but does not challenge the factual\naccuracy of the rumors. Nor does it challenge the other |\nindependent, significant testimony from Fields and Coleman (\nthat [Petitioner] incriminated himself to them. Most\nimportantly, it does not challenge Gardner's eyewitness\ntestimony that she saw [Petitioner] enter the vehicle in which\n\n48\nthe Francis and Guy were killed moments before its windows\n\u201cerupted\u201d and that he later attempted to \u201capologize.\u201d The\nrecantation merely impeaches Waterman's trial testimony and\ndoes not constitute new evidence that proves actual\ninnocence.\nWashington, 2021 WL 5232259, at *6. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that\ndecision. See Washington, 2022 WL 1041267.\n\n\u201cCourts have historically viewed recantation testimony with great suspicion.\u201d\nLandano v. Rafferty, 856 F.2d 569, 572 (3d Cir. 1988); see Dobbert v. Wainwright, 468\nU.S. 1231, 1233-34 (1984) (Recantation testimony is properly viewed with great\nsuspicion. It. . . is very often unreliable and given for suspect motives. ...\"). \"Asa\ngeneral matter, a recantation in the absence of corroborating evidence or circumstances\nwill probably fall short of the standard of reliability contemplated by Schiup.\u201d Howell v.\nSup't Albion SCI, 978 F.3d 54, 60 (3d Cir. 2020). A court considering whether a claim of\nactual innocence premised on a recantation satisfies Sch/iup should analyze the\nrecantation \u201con an individual and fact-specific basis.\u201d Howell, 978 F.3d at 60.\n\nAfter reviewing Waterman's affidavit in conjunction with the record and the\nforegoing legal framework, the Court concludes that Waterman's affidavit does not\nsatisfy the Schlup standard for establishing actual innocence. First, Waterman\u2019s\nproffered July 2017 affidavit is neither reliable nor credible. Petitioner produced\nWaterman\u2019s affidavit more than six years after trial. See McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569\nU.S. 383, 399 (2013) (\u201cAs we stated in Schlup, [a] court may consider how the timing of\n\nthe submission and the likely credibility of [a petitioner's] affiants bear on the probable\n\nreliability of ... evidence [of actual innocence].\u201d); Sistrunk v. Rozum, 674 F.3d 181, 190-\n\n49\n91 (3d Cir. 2012) (rejecting equitable tolling argument based on a letter from a witness\nallegedly showing Sistrunk\u2019s actual innocence in part because the letter was produced a\ndecade late). Waterman's statements are even more implausible because the trial\nrecord reveals that there were attempts to intimidate Waterman in court on the day he\ntestified against Petitioner (see D.|. 47-3 at 57-60), and because there was other\nsignificant, independent evidence against Petitioner that Waterman's posttrial\nstatements do not address.\n\nSecond, Waterman\u2019s statements, to the extent they are a recantation, do not\nexonerate Petitioner or provide new evidence that a person other than Petitioner\ncommitted the crime. Waterman testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination\nregarding whether his testimony at trial was based on statements Petitioner made\ndirectly to him or whether it was based on information he had heard from other inmates.\n(D.I. 47-3 at 48-57) Defense counsel attacked Waterman\u2019s credibility and the trial\nrecord clearly shows that Waterman was questioned about motive, bias, and basis to\nlie. (D.1. 47-3 at 50-57)\n\nThird, defense counsel introduced Waterman's plea agreement into evidence\nand cross-examined Waterman about his hopes that federal prosecutors would\nrecommend a reduction in his sentence for federal weapon charges due to his\ncooperation with authorities in Petitioner's case. (D.1. 47-3 at 50-57) The plea\nagreement reflected that, if the government determined in its sole discretion Waterman\nhad fulfilled his obligations of cooperation, the government would file a motion for a\n\ndownward departure from the sentencing guidelines under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n\n50\n\n\u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). See Washington, 2017 WL 1573119, at *4 (noting\nthat neither \u00a7 5K1.1 nor \u00a7 3553(e) guaranteed Waterman sentencing leniency in\nexchange for his testimony). Ultimately, the jury rejected Petitioner's argument that\nWaterman\u2019s testimony was not credible. (See D.I. 47-3 at 50-57, 293, 299-300)\n\nFurthermore, Waterman\u2019s post-trial recantation amounts to impeachment\nevidence and, unlike another person confessing guilt or exculpatory scientific\nevidence,\"\u00ae is insufficient to establish actual innocence. As the United States Supreme\nCourt has recognized, \u201clatter-day evidence brought forward to impeach a prosecution\nwitness will seldom, if ever, make a clear and convincing showing that no reasonable\njuror would have believed the heart of [the] account of petitioner's actions.\u201d Sawyer v.\nWhitley, 505 U.S. 333, 349 (1992); see Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 563\n(1998) (\u201cThis impeachment evidence provides no basis for finding a miscarriage of\njustice. As in Sawyer, the evidence is a step removed from evidence pertaining to the\ncrime itself. It tends only to impeach the credibility of [two witnesses].\u201d) (cleaned up).\nThat is especially true where, as here, the evidence is a \u201cstep removed\u201d from the\ncriminal acts themselves. Cf. Calderon, 523 U.S. at 563.\n\nFinally, even if the affidavit or unsworn statement constitutes new and\nreliable evidence\u2014which the Court does not find\u2014Petitioner has failed to establish that,\nwithout Waterman\u2019s testimony, no reasonable juror would have voted to find him guilty ~\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The question of Petitioner\u2019s guilt was not a close one.\n\nAside from Waterman\u2019s testimony, there was significant additional evidence at trial of\n\n10See Schlup, 513 U.S. at 324; Sawyer, 505 U.S. at 340-41.\n51\nWashington\u2019s guilt, including Gardner's eyewitness testimony (D.I. 47-3 at 73-76, 81),\nand Fields\u2019 and Coleman\u2019s trial testimony that Washington admitted to killing Francis\nand Guy (D.1. 47-3 at 63-67, 85-89).1' Although Petitioner has attacked the testimony of\nWaterman and Fields, he is still left with the damning eyewitness testimony of April\nGardner. At trial, Gardner testified that, prior to the shooting, she was outside sitting on\nher front steps watching her grandson ride his bicycle when she observed Petitioner\nand another male\u2014later identified as Guy\u2014walking down 10th Street. (D.I. 47-3 at 73-\n76) Gardner told the jury that she knew Petitioner because he had grown up in the\nneighborhood and had gone to school with her children. (D.|. 47-3 at 73) Gardner\ntestified that she observed Petitioner and his companion approach another man who\nwas sitting in the driver's seat of a vehicle that was parked directly in front of her house.\n(D.I. 47-3 at 74) According to Gardner, after the three men conversed briefly, Guy got\ninto the right front passenger seat of the vehicle and Petitioner got into the right rear\npassenger seat. (D.|. 47-3 at 74) Gardner testified that moments after the two men\nentered the vehicle the vehicle\u2019s windows \u201cerupted.\u201d (D.I. 47-3 at 74) Shocked by the\n\nexplosion, Gardner said, she immediately \u201cgrabbed [her] grandson\u201d and ran to her\n\n11At the risk of being repetitive, the Court again notes that, at trial, Fields testified that,\nwhile they were both at the same prison, Petitioner told him that he unintentionally killed\nFrancis and Guy with a MAC-10 in a robbery or drug deal that went wrong and that\n\u201c[s]ome lady named April\u201d witnessed the shooting. (D.I. 47-3 at 85-89) Fields also\ntestified that he saw Petitioner accidentally fire a MAC-10 at 930 Spruce Street a few\nmonths before Francis and Guy were killed. (D.I. 47-3 at 86-88) Coleman testified that,\nwhile they were at the same prison, Petitioner told him that he shot Francis and Guy\nfrom the back seat of a car with a MAC-10 in a robbery that went wrong, he disposed of\nthe MAC10 used in the shooting, and April Gardner had witnessed the shooting. (D.I.\n47-3 at 63-67)\n\n52\n\ndaughter's house around the corner where she remained for several hours before\nreturning home. (D.I. 47-3 at 74-75) Gardner testified that as she ran from the scene,\nshe could feel shards of glass getting caught in her hair, and that she had \u201cglass all in\n[her] hair\u2019 when she reached her daughter's house. (D.I. 47-3 at 74-75) Gardner further\ntestified that Washington came to her home later that evening \u201cto apologize,\u201d but that\nshe refused to speak to him. (D.|. 47-3 at 75-76, 81) Gardner's testimony inculpates\nPetitioner, and he cannot show that no reasonable juror would have voted to find him\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on Waterman's post-trial recantation. Thus,\nafter reviewing Waterman's affidavit in context with the record, the Court concludes that\nWaterman's recantation does not constitute new reliable factual evidence of Petitioner's\nactual innocence as required by Schlup.\nb. Isaiah Fields\u2019 tacit agreement\n\nAs previously explained, Fields testified that, while he and Petitioner were in the\nsame prison, Petitioner told Fields that he unintentionally killed Francis and Guy with a\nMAC-10 in a robbery or drug deal that went wrong and that \u201c[s]ome lady named April\u2019\nwitnessed the shooting. (D.|. 47-3 at 85-89) Fields also testified that he saw Petitioner\naccidentally fire a MAC-10 at 930 Spruce Street a few months before Francis and Guy\nwere killed. (D.1. 47-3 at 86-88) At the time of his testimony, Fields was incarcerated\nand serving a five-year sentence for a first degree assault conviction.\n\nApproximately two months after Petitioner's trial and about a month before\nPetitioner was sentenced, the State filed a motion to reduce Fields\u2019s sentence premised\n\non Fields\u2019s substantial assistance with the State in Washington\u2019s case. (D.I. 76-8 at\n\n53\n\n417-420) The State asserted that Fields\u2019s assistance was worth one year of credit on\nhis five-year sentence for assault. (D.I. 76-8 at 419) On January 18, 2011, the court\ngranted the motion and Fields\u2019s sentence was reduced from five years to four years.\n(D.1. 76-8 at 421-423)\n\nAs he did in his second Rule 61 motion, Petitioner now argues that the\nsubstantial assistance motion filed by the State after Petitioner's trial, along with Fields\u2019\nreduced sentence, demonstrates that the State had a tacit agreement with Fields to\nprovide him with a benefit (reduced sentence) in exchange for his testimony.!? (D.1. 69\nat 8-23) Petitioner contends that the State violated Brady by not disclosing the\nagreement to him prior to trial, and that the evidence of the tacit agreement constitutes\nnew evidence of his actual innocence, because he could have used the alleged deal\nbetween Fields and the State to impeach Fields\u2019 testimony at trial.\n\nPetitioner's proffered evidence of a \u201ctacit agreement\u201d between the State and\nFields does not constitute new reliable evidence of Petitioner's factual innocence. First,\nthe evidence is not \u201cnew\u201d because the instant argument was available to Petitioner at\nthe time of his direct appeal and his first Rule 61 motion, given that the substantial\nassistance motion was filed prior to Petitioner\u2019s direct appeal. Second, Petitioner does\nnot provide, and nothing in the record indicates, that there was a substantial assistance\nagreement between Fields and the State at the time of his testimony. When he\ntestified, Fields explained that he was incarcerated and serving a five-year sentence,\n\nand he testified that no agreement had been worked out in exchange for his testimony.\n\n\u201cPetitioner raises the issue of the alleged Brady violation as an independent ground for\nrelief in Claim Twenty-One (a).\n54\n(D.1 47-3 at 85, 88) He also responded \u201c[yJes,\u201d when asked whether he \u201cwantfed] to be\nhere today\u201d to testify. (D.1. 47-3 at 88) On cross-examination, Fields explained that he\nwas testifying to \u201chelp solve\u201d the homicide and stated that he \u201cain\u2019t getting nothing out of\nit\u201d and that he was not protecting anyone else. (D.!. 47-3 at 90) He asserted that he\ncame forward to investigators because he \u201cwanted to help the situation.\u201d (D.I. 47-3 at\n91) Defense counsel attacked Fields\u2019s credibility on cross-examination and in closing.\n(D.|. 47-3 at 88-91, 292-302)\n\nThird, prior to Fields\u2019 testimony, during discussions with the Superior Court about\nthe relevancy of the defense\u2019s line of questioning for another witness, the State made\nthe statement:\n\nHas Isaiah Field[s] asked for a break? No, he wasn\u2019t smart\n\nenough to do that beforehand. He pled to a five-year min/man,\n\nand there\u2019s not a whole lot | can do about that and | told him\n\nthat.\n(D.1. 47-3 at 45) During closing arguments, the State also asserted, \u201cIsaiah Fields, he\ndidn't ask for a deal. He\u2019s serving 5 years for an Assault Second. Told you, \u2018I didn\u2019t\nget a deal.\u201d (D.1. 47-3 at 305) In fact, Fields\u2019 former counsel provided a statement that\nhe had \u201cno recollection of any involvement in any substantial assistance motion for\n[Fields] or any request for same.\u201d (D.I. 76-8 at 428) In sum, viewing the foregoing\ncircumstances together demonstrates that Petitioner has failed to demonstrate the\nexistence of a substantial assistance agreement.\n\nNevertheless, even if such an agreement existed at trial, Petitioner cannot show\nthat no reasonable juror would have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nif the existence of such an agreement had been disclosed. At most, Petitioner's\n\n55\n\nproffered evidence of an undisclosed tacit agreement with the State would have\nconstituted impeachment evidence that does not create a strong inference of\nPetitioner's actual innocence.\n\nThus, after reviewing Petitioner's purported evidence of a tacit agreement in\ncontext with the entire record, the Court concludes that the alleged tacit agreement\ndoes not constitute new reliable factual evidence of Petitioner's actual innocence as\nrequired by Schlup.\n\nc. Carl Rone\n\nPetitioner also asserts that he has established a miscarriage of justice\nBecause \u201cnew evidence . . . proves Carl Rone\u2019s testing was insufficient, unreliable,\nand he shouldn't [have] been testifying as an expert witness.\u201d (D.I. 69 at 27; D.I. 81 at\n1) In addition, Petitioner contends that Rone\u2019s arrest and conviction for theft and\nfalsifying business records that occurred years after his 2010 trial demonstrates his\nactual innocence. (D.I. 69 at 27)\n\nPetitioner is mistaken. To the extent Petitioner relies on Rone\u2019s\n\nmisrepresentation of his credentials during the trial, and the alleged deficiency of Rone\u2019s\n\nmethodology, neither constitutes new evidence of Petitioner's actual innocence because\nboth issues were available at the time of Petitioner's trial. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on\nRone\u2019s arrest and conviction for theft and falsifying business records also fails to\nestablish a claim of newly discovered evidence of Petitioner's actual innocence. At\nmost, Rone\u2019s misconduct and subsequent criminal convictions, which occurred years\n\nafter Petitioner's 2010 trial, amount to impeachment evidence. Rone\u2019s misconduct did\n\n56\nnot involve the mishandling or falsification of ballistics evidence, and Petitioner has not\nshown that Rone mishandled or fabricated evidence in his case.\n\nIn sum, Petitioners complaints about Rone constitute impeachment evidence\nthat, even when viewed together, are not persuasive in light of the additional significant\nevidence of Petitioner's guilt. Petitioner has not shown that, in light of his \u201cnew\u201d\nevidence concerning Rone, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would\nhave convicted him absent the error. Consequently, the miscarriage of justice\nexception to the procedural default does not apply.\n\nd. Richardson affidavit\n\nFinally, Petitioner has provided a February 2018 affidavit from an inmate, Jeree\nRichardson, to show that the shooting did not occur in front of Gardner's house. (D.1. 46\nat 11; D.1. 57 at 1) In his affidavit, Richardson asserts that, on the day of the shooting,\nhe told City Councilwoman Stephanie Bolden and two police officers that he had seen\nthe car drive down Pine Street and turn on Tenth Street before it crashed. (D.1. 34 at 6-\n7, 12; D.I. 46 at 11) Richardson\u2019s affidavit does not address Petitioner's role in the\nhomicide at all. Therefore, Richardson's affidavit does not constitute the strong\nevidence of actual innocence needed to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice would\noccur if the claim was not heard.\n\nTo summarize, Petitioner has not demonstrated cause for his default of Claims\nEight, Nine, Ten (b) and (c), Twelve (a), (b), and (c), Thirteen, Fourteen (a), Sixteen,\nSeventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty, Twenty-One (b), and Twenty-Two (a).\n\nAdditionally, since Petitioner's attempts to demonstrate new reliable evidence of his\n\n57\n\nactual innocence are unsuccessful, Petitioner's default of the instant Claims cannot be\nexcused under the miscarriage of justice exception to the procedural default doctrine.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claims Eight, Nine, Ten (b) and (c), Twelve (a), (b), and\n(c), Thirteen, Fourteen (a), Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty, Twenty-\nOne (b), and Twenty-Two (a) as procedurally barred.\n\nC. Procedurally Barred Prosecutorial Misconduct Claims\n\nPetitioner presents four prosecutorial claims: Claims Two, Three (a) and (b), Five\n(a), and Six. In Claim Two, Petitioner contends that the State \u201cmanipulat[ed] facts and\nmisle[d] the jury as to the conditions of [Waterman\u2019s] federal plea agreement. (D.I. 1 at\n7) Claim Three asserts that the State (a) manipulated evidence and (b) improperly\nvouched for the State\u2019s witnesses at trial. (D.I. 1 at 8-9; D.1. 29 at 11) In Claim Five (a),\nPetitioner contends that the State improperly interjected information into the trial during\nsummation regarding as to where the shooter was seated in the vehicle, which was not\nfactually supported by the testimony of the State\u2019s ballistics expert, Rone. (D.I. 1 at 12)\nFinally, in Claim Six, Petitioner asserts that the State falsely told the jury during opening\nand closing statements that Rone would testify, and did testify, that bullets and bullet\nfragments recovered from the car, the victims, 930 Spruce Street, and the street in front\nof Gardner's house came from the same gun. (D.I. 1 at 14; D.I. 29 at 11)\n\nPetitioner presented Claims Two, Three (a), Five (a) , and Six to the Superior\nCourt in his first Rule 61 motion, and then to the Delaware Supreme Court on appeal\n\nfrom the denial of that Rule 61 motion. (D.I. 47-6 at 19-26, 34-44) The Delaware\n\n58\n\nSupreme Court denied Claims Two, Three (a), Five (a), and Six as barred under Rule\n61(i)(3).\n\nPetitioner presented Claim Three (b) for the first time to the Delaware Supreme\nCourt on post-conviction appeal. As a result, the Delaware Supreme Court only\nreviewed Claim Three (b) for plain error under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8.\n\nBy applying the procedural bars of Rule 8 and Rule 61(i)(3), the Delaware\nSupreme Court articulated a \u201cplain statement\u2019 under Harris v. Reed that its decision\nrested on state law grounds... See Harris, 489 U.S. at 263-64. This Court has\nconsistently held that Rule 8 and Rule 61(i)(3) are independent and adequate state\nprocedural rules effectuating a procedural default. See Harris, 489 U.S. at 263-64;\nDeAngelo v. Johnson, 2014 WL 4079357, at *12 (D. Del. Aug. 15, 2014); Lawrie v.\nSnyder, 9 F. Supp. 2d 428, 451 (D. Del. 1998). Therefore, the Court cannot review the\nmerits of Claims Two, Three (a) and (b), Five (a), and Six absent a showing of cause for\nthe default, and prejudice resulting therefrom, or upon a showing that a miscarriage of\njustice will occur if the claim is not reviewed.\n\nPetitioner does not allege any cause for his default of Claim Six. He does,\nhowever, assert ineffective assistance of defense counsel as cause for his default of\nClaims Two, Three (a), (b), and Five (a). Ineffective assistance provided by a trial\nattorney can constitute cause for a procedural default if the particular ineffective\nassistance allegation was presented to the state courts as an independent claim and it\nwas determined that the attorney's error amounted to constitutionally ineffective\n\nassistance. See Murray, 477 U.S. at 488-89. An ineffective assistance of trial counsel\n\n59\n\nclaim cannot constitute cause if the claim itself is procedurally defaulted. See Edwards,\n529 U.S. at 451-5.\n\nHere, Petitioner did not fairly present his ineffective assistance of counsel claims\nrelated to the prosecutorial misconduct alleged in Claims Two and Three (a) and (b) to\nthe Delaware Supreme Court on post-conviction appeal. Therefore, these instant\nineffective assistance of counsel allegations are themselves defaulted and cannot\nexcuse Petitioner's default of Claims Two and Three (a) and (b).\n\nIn-Claim Five (a), Petitioner argues that the State misstated the evidence by\ntelling the jury during summation: (1) that Gardner testified that Petitioner got into the\n\nback seat of the passenger side seat of the car moments before the car windows\n\nerupted; and (2) that Rone testified that, if more than one person had been present in\nthe back seat of the car, that person would have been shot. (D.|. 1 at 12) Petitioner\nfairly presented his allegation that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by\nfailing to object to the prosecutorial misconduct asserted in Claim Five (a) to the\nDelaware Supreme Court on post-conviction appeal, but the Delaware Supreme Court\nheld that defense counsel did not provide constitutionally ineffective assistance by\nfailing to object to the State's assertion concerning the location of the shooter in the car.\nAs explained in its discussion of Claim Five (b), the Court concludes that the Delaware\nSupreme Court reasonably applied Strickland in holding that defense counsel did not\nprovide constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to object the prosecutorial\nmisconduct alleged in Claim Five (a). See supra at Section IIl.A.2. Therefore, defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s action do not constitute cause for Petitioner's default of Claim Five (a).\n\n60\nIn the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue of prejudice.\nMoreover, Petitioner's default of the instant Claims cannot be excused under AEDPA\u2019s\nmiscarriage of justice exception because, as previously explained, Petitioner has failed\nto provide new reliable evidence of his actual innocence. See supra at Sections III.A.1,\nI1.B.2, HI.B.4 and n.11. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claims Two, Three (a), (b),\nFive (a) and Six as procedurally barred.\n\nD. Claim Twenty-One (a): Brady Violation\n\nIn January 2011, two months after the conclusion of Petitioner's trial but before\nhis sentencing, the State filed, and was granted, a motion to reduce Fields\u2019 sentence\nbased on Fields\u2019 substantial assistance in prosecuting Petitioner. Petitioner asserts that\nthe State\u2019s act of filing the motion to reduce Fields\u2019 sentence is evidence that an\nundisclosed tacit agreement between Fields and the State existed at the time of his trial.\n(D.1. 69 at 8-23) Thus, in Claim Twenty-One (a), Petitioner contends that the State\nviolated Brady by failing to disclose that Isaiah Fields was the beneficiary of a tacit\nsentence reduction agreement, and that. (D.I. 69 at 13-16) He contends that he could\nhave used the alleged deal between Fields and the State to impeach Fields\u2019 testimony\nat trial. (D.I. 69 at 19; D.I. 76-9 at 35-40)\n\nPetitioner presented this argument to the Superior Court in his second Rule 61\nmotion. (D.I. 76-9 at 35-40) The Superior Court denied Petitioner's Brady claim as\nbarred under Rule 61(i)(1) for being untimely, under Rule 61(i)(2) for being successive,\nand under Rule 61(i)(3) for being procedurally defaulted because Petitioner did not raise\n\nthe issue during the trial. See Washington, 2021 WL 5232259, at *5-6. The Delaware\n\n61\n\nSupreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision \u201con the basis of and for the\nreasons assigned in the Superior Court\u2019s November 9, 2012 order denying [Petitioner's]\nsecond motion for postconviction relief.\u201d See Washington, 2022 WL 1041267, at *1.\nBy applying the procedural bars of Rule 61(i)(1), (2), and (3), the Delaware state\ncourts articulated a \u201cplain statement\u201d under Harris v. Reed that its decision rested on\nstate law grounds. See Harris, 489 U.S. at 263-64. This Court has consistently held\nthat Rule 61(i)(1) and (3) are independent and adequate state procedural rules\neffectuating a procedural default, and recently confirmed that the version of Rule\n61(i)(2) applied to Petitioner\u2019s second Rule 61 motion also constitutes an independent\nand adequate state procedural rule effectuating a procedural default.'? See Stanford v.\nAkinbayo, 2021 WL 4263045, at *9 (D. Del. Sept. 20, 2021) (\u201c[T]his Court has\nconsistently held that Rule 61(i)(1) and (3) are independent and adequate state\nprocedural rules.\u201d); Taylor v. May, 2022 WL 980859, at *16-21 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2022)\n(holding that, as applied to Taylor's case, the post-2014 version of Rule 61(i)(2) was an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rule). Therefore, the Court cannot review\nthe merits of Claim Twenty-One (a) absent a showing of cause for the default, and\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or upon a showing that a miscarriage of justice will occur\n\nif the claim is not reviewed.\n\n13The version of Rule 61(i)(2) that the Superior Court applied to Petitioner's case\nbecame effective in June 2014. Although Petitioner filed his initial first Rule 61 motion\nin 2012, he was still amending that Rule 61 motion up until March 28, 2016. (See D.1.\n47-1 at Entry No. 140) Since Petitioner had notice of the precise parameters of the\nsuccessive bars under the post-2014 version of Rule 61(i)(2) while his first Rule 61\nmotion was still being briefed and amended the Court concludes that the post-2014\nversion of Rule 61(i)(2) constituted an independent and adequate state procedural rule\nas applied to his case.\n\n62\nIn Brady v. Maryland, the Supreme Court held \u201cthat the suppression by the\nprosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process\nwhere the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good\nfaith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. This \u201cduty to disclose such\nevidence is applicable even though there has been no request by the accused,\u201d and\nincludes \u201cimpeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence.\u201d Strickler v. Greene,\n527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999). \u201cSuch evidence is material if there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different.\u201d /d. \u201cIn order to comply with Brady, therefore,\nthe individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the\nothers acting on the government's behalf in this case, including the police.\u201d /d. at 281\n(cleaned up). \u201cThere are three components of a true Brady violation: The evidence at\nissue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is\nimpeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or\ninadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued [i.e., the evidence was material].\u201d /d. at\n281-82. Evidence is material \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the\nevidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.\u201d Bagley, 473 U.S.667, 682 (1985). \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 of a different\nresult is accordingly shown when the government\u2019s evidentiary suppression\n\u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419,\n\n434 (1995).\n\n63\n\nIn the context of procedural default, \u201ccause and prejudice parallel two of the three\ncomponents of the alleged Brady violation itself.\u201d Strickler, 527 U.S. at 282. The\nsuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused provides cause to\nexcuse the petitioner's procedural default, but unless the evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d under\nBrady, the petitioner is unable to demonstrate \u201csufficient prejudice to overcome the\nprocedural default.\u201d /d. Therefore, if Petitioner establishes that the State suppressed\nevidence and that the evidence was material, he will also establish cause and prejudice\nto excuse his procedural default of Claim Twenty-One (a).\n\nAs the Court has previously discussed at length with respect to Petitioner's actual\ninnocence argument, Petitioner has not established that the State suppressed evidence\nof a tacit agreement with Fields, primarily because there is no evidence that such an\nagreement existed. See supra Section III.B.4; see also Washington, 2021 WL 5232259,\nat *7, affd, 2022 WL 1041267, at *1.\n\nFurthermore, even if Petitioner's allegation that a tacit agreement existed were\ntrue, he has failed to demonstrate its materiality. As the Third Circuit has noted:\n\nThe materiality of Brady material depends almost entirely on\nthe value of the evidence relative to the other evidence\nmustered by the state. Suppressed evidence that would be\ncumulative of other evidence or would be used to impeach\ntestimony of a witness whose account is strongly corroborated\nis generally not considered material for Brady purposes.\nConversely, however, undisclosed evidence that would\nseriously undermine the testimony of a key witness may be\nconsidered material when it relates to an essential issue or\n\nthe testimony lacks strong corroboration.\n\nJohnson v. Folino, 705 F.3d 117, 129 (3d Cir. 2013) (cleaned up).\n\n64\nNotably, there was additional significant evidence of Petitioner's guilt, which\nincluded Gardner\u2019s eyewitness testimony and Coleman\u2019s testimony that Petitioner\nadmitted to killing Francis and Guy. See Washington, 2021 WL 5232259, at *7, affad,\n2022 WL 1041267, at *1; see also supra at Sections III.A.1, III.B.2, Ill.B.4, and n.11.\nThus, even if an agreement existed between the State and Fields, Petitioner cannot\nshow a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent if the existence of the agreement had been disclose, or that its disclosure\nwould probably change the result if a new trial was granted.\n\nIn sum, Petitioner has failed to establish cause for his procedural default because\nhe can show neither that the State suppressed evidence, nor that the evidence was\nmaterial.\n\nTo the extent Petitioner asserts that his failure to raise Claim Twenty-One (a)\nearlier should be excused because it was due to the ineffective assistance of trial and/or\nappellate counsel, his contention is unavailing. (See D.I. 69 at 8-23; D.|. 72) Claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel cannot establish cause for a procedural default unless\nthey were first presented to the state courts as an independent claim, and Petitioner did\nnot present this particular ineffective assistance of trial and/or appellate counsel claim to\nthe State courts. Similarly, to the extent Petitioner may be attempting to invoke\nMartinez to establish cause for his default by claiming that his postconviction counsel\nwas ineffective for failing to raise this Claim, the argument fails. (See D.I. 69 at 16, 20-\n23) The limited exception articulated in Martinez only applies where the underlying\n\nclaim is one of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See Davila, 137 S. Ct. at 2062.\n\n65\n\nConsequently, Petitioner cannot invoke Martinez to establish cause for the procedural\ndefault of the instant freestanding Brady claim or any claim that appellate counsel was\nineffective.\n\nPetitioner does not allege any other cause for his procedural default of Claim\nTwenty-One (a). In the absence of cause, the Court need not address the issue of\nprejudice. Moreover, Petitioner's default of the instant Claim cannot be excused under\n\nAEDPA\u2019s miscarriage of justice exception because, as previously explained, Petitioner\n\nhas failed to provide new reliable evidence of his actual innocence. See supra at\nSection Ill.B.4. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Twenty-One (a) as procedurally\nbarred.\n\nE. Procedurally Defaulted Claims Alleging Trial Court Error\n\nPetitioner asserts three Claims alleging that the Superior Court erred and/or\n\nabused its discretion during his trial: Claims Four, Seven (a), and Fourteen (b). In\n\nClaim Four, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court committed plain error by\npermitting Detective Ciritella to testify as an expert. Claim Seven (a) asserts that the\nSuperior Court abused its discretion by dismissing Carl Rone, the State\u2019s ballistics\nexpert, before Petitioner had the opportunity to view the vehicle involved in the incident\nand cross-examine Rone. In Claim Fourteen (b), Petitioner asserts that the Superior\nCourt erred by not inquiring into the conflict of interest between defense counsel and the |\nprosecutor.\nPetitioner presented Claims Four and Seven (a) to the Delaware Supreme Court\n\non appeal from the denial of his first Rule 61 motion. The Delaware Supreme Court\n\n66\ndenied the Claims as procedurally barred under Rule 61(i)(3), and also denied a portion\nof Claim Seven (a) under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8. Rule 8 and Rule 61(i)(3)\nconstitute and independent and adequate state law grounds. Therefore, the Court\ncannot review the merits of the Claims absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or a\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\nPetitioner did not present Claim Fourteen (b) to the Delaware Supreme Court on\npost-conviction appeal. At this juncture, Rule 61(i), (ii), and (iii) would prevent Petitioner\nfrom presenting Claim Fourteen (b) in a new Rule 61 motion. Therefore, the Court must\ntreat Claim Fourteen (b) as procedurally defaulted, which means that it cannot review its\nmerits absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or a miscarriage of justice.\n\nPetitioner attempts to establish cause by blaming defense counsel for not raising\nthe instant Claims during trial. As discussed in its discussion of Claim Seven (b), the\nCourt concludes that defense counsel did not perform ineffectively by not objecting\nwhen the Superior Court dismissed Carl Rone, the State\u2019s ballistics expert, before\nPetitioner had the opportunity to view the vehicle involved in the incident and cross-\nexamine Rone (Claim Seven (b). See supra at Section IIl.A.3. Therefore, defense\ncounsel\u2019s actions cannot excuse Petitioner's default of Claim Seven (a). As for Claims\nFour and Fourteen (b), defense counsel's failure to raise these Claims cannot excuse\nPetitioner's default because, as discussed above, the related claims of ineffective\nassistance (Claims Twelve (c) and Fourteen (a)) are themselves procedurally defaulted.\n\nIn the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue of prejudice. In\n\naddition, the miscarriage of justice exception to the procedural default does not excuse\n\n67\nPetitioner's default because, as discussed above, he has not presented new reliable\nevidence of his actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claims Four, Seven\n(a), and Fourteen (b) as procedurally barred.\n\nF. Ineffective Assistance of Post-Conviction Counsel\n\nPetitioner presents three Claims alleging that post-conviction counsel provided\nineffective assistance. In Claim Fifteen, he asserts that post-conviction counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance by: (1) failing to investigate beyond the trial record and\nprove his innocence; (2) failing to provide an investigator to prove his innocence; (3)\nfailing to advise Petitioner about the standard for relief under Rule 61; and (4) moving to\nwithdraw. In Claim Twenty-One (c), Petitioner contends that post-conviction counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to raise the Brady Claim in his Rule 61 motion.\nIn Claim Twenty-Two (b), Petitioner contends that post-conviction counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to investigate and raise the issue of defense counsel\u2019s\nineffective assistance with respect to Carl Rone.\n\nThere is no federal constitutional right to effective assistance of post-conviction\ncounsel. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 752. In fact, the AEDPA specifically provides that\n\u201cthe ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal or State collateral post-\nconviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding under section\n2254.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(i). Therefore, the Court will deny Claims Fifteen, Twenty-One\n(c ), and Twenty-Two (b) because they do not assert an issue cognizable on federal\n\nhabeas review. See, e.g., Jordan v. Sup't Somerset SCI, 2017 WL 5564555, at *1 (3d\n\n68\n\nCir. Feb. 15, 2017) (\u2018[C]laims alleging ineffective assistance of PCRA counsel are non-\ncognizable in federal habeas, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(i).\u201d).\n\nG. Claim Twenty-Three: Actual Innocence\n\nIn his final Claim, Petitioner appears to assert a freestanding claim of actual\ninnocence based on his alleged \u201cnew\u201d evidence of Waterman's recantation, Fields\u2019\nallegedly undisclosed \u201ctacit\u201d sentence reduction agreement, and Rone\u2019s qualifications\nand methodology.\n\nWhether or not a freestanding claim of actual innocence is cognizable on federal\nhabeas review remains an open question in Supreme Court jurisprudence. See\nMcQuiggin, 569 U.S. at 392; Reeves v. Fayette SCI, 897 F.3d 154, 160 n.4 (3d Cir.\n2018). Assuming, arguendo, that a free-standing claim of actual innocence\nis cognizable, a petitioner's burden on any such claim \u201cwould necessarily be\nextraordinarily high\u201d and \u201cmore demanding\u201d than that applied to gateway actual-\ninnocence claims. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 416 (1993); see also Reeves, 897\nF.3d at 160 n.4 (describing hypothetical freestanding actual-innocence standard as\n\u201cmore demanding\u2019 than that applied to gateway actual-innocence claims). To put\nPetitioners\u2019 burden of establishing a free-standing claim of actual innocence in\nperspective, a gateway actual innocence claim that is asserted in an effort to overcome\na procedural bar for habeas cases will only prevail if it is based on \u201cnew reliable\nevidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness\naccounts, or critical physical evidence [ ] that was not presented at trial.\u201d Schlup, 513\n\nU.S. at 324. The Court has already concluded that Petitioner's new evidence of\n\n69\nWaterman\u2019s recantation, Fields\u2019 alleged tacit sentence reduction agreement, and the\nissues surrounding Rone\u2019s qualifications and methodology does not satisfy\n\nthe Schiup standard. See supra at Section III.B.4. Thus, on the facts presented,\nPetitioner's assertion of actual innocence does not provide a basis for relief under\n\n\u00a7 2254.\n\nH. Pending Motions\n\nPetitioner has filed a Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing (D.I. 67), a Motion for the\nAppointment of Counsel (D.1. 68), and a Motion for both the Appointment of Counsel\nand an Evidentiary Hearing (D.I. 70) !n light of the Court\u2019s decision that the Petition\nshould be denied, the Court will dismiss Petitioner's requests for the appointment of\ncounsel as moot.\n\nTurning to Petitioner's request for an evidentiary hearing, Petitioner appears to\nassert that an evidentiary hearing is warranted because he is pro se and had \u201cno\ncounsel on his direct appeal and first round of collateral proceedings.\u201d (D.I. 67 at 8) To\nsupport his request, Petitioner merely sets forth a detailed history of his proceedings in\nthe state courts. (D.1. 67)\n\nA federal habeas petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing in most\ncases. The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[a]lthough state prisoners may\nsometimes submit new evidence in federal court, AEDPA\u2019s statutory scheme is\ndesigned to strongly discourage them from doing so.\u201d Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S.\n170, 185-86 (2011). Typically, requests for an evidentiary hearing in a federal habeas\n\nproceeding are evaluated under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2), which provides:\n\n70\n(2) If the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a\nclaim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold\nan evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant\nshows that\n\n(A) the claim relies on \u2014\n(i) a new rule of constitutional law,\nmade retroactive to cases on collateral\nreview by the Supreme Court, that was\npreviously unavailable; or\n(ii) a factual predicate that could not\nhave been previously discovered\nthrough the exercise of due diligence;\nand\n\n(B) the facts underlying the claim would be\nsufficient to establish by clear and\nconvincing evidence that but for\nconstitutional error, no reasonable\nfactfinder would have found the applicant\nguilty of the underlying offense.\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2).\n\n\u201cAta minimum, . . . \u00a7 2254(e)(2) still restricts the discretion of federal habeas\ncourts to consider new evidence when deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the\nmerits in state court.\u201d Cullen, 563 U.S. at 186; see also Schriro v. Landrigan, 550\nU.S.465, 468 (2007) (\u201cIn cases where an applicant for federal habeas relief is not barred\n\nfrom obtaining an evidentiary hearing by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2), the decision to grant\n\ni\n|\ni\nij\ni\ni\n\nsuch a hearing rests in the discretion of the district court.\u201d); Rule 8 of the Rules\n\nGoverning Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7\n2254. When deciding whether to grant a hearing, the \u201ccourt must consider whether\nsuch a hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition\u2019s factual allegations,\u201d\n\ntaking into consideration the \u201cdeferential standards prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d\n\n71\n\nSchriro, 550 U.S. at 474. An evidentiary hearing is not necessary if the issues can be\nresolved by reference to the record developed in the state courts. /d.\n\nThe Court has determined that Petitioner's Claims are meritless, procedurally\nbarred, and/or not cognizable. Petitioner's assertions do not demonstrate how a\nhearing would advance his arguments. Therefore, the Court will deny Petitioner's\nrequest for an evidentiary hearing\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nThe Court must decide whether to issue a certificate of appealabilty. See 3d Cir.\nL.A.R. 22.2 (2011). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes\na \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat\nreasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims\ndebatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,\n484 (2000). Additionally, if a federal court denies a habeas petition on procedural\ngrounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required\nto issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of\nreason would find debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of\n\na constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling. See\n\nSlack, 529 U.S. at 484.\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition fails to warrant federal habeas\nrelief. Reasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly,\n\nthe Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.\n\n72\nV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will deny the instant Petition without\nan evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n73\n"}
