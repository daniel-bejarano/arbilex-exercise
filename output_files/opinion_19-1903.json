{"case_name": "Peloton Interactive, Inc. v. Echelon Fitness Multimedia LLC, et al.", "case_number": "19-1903", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "01-04-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPELOTON INTERACTIVE , INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nECHELON FITNESS \nMULTIMEDIA LLC, et al., \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 19-1903-RGA \nConsolidated \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nA couple of years ago, the Third Circuit was pretty clear as to what was required to seal a \njudicial record such as a complaint. There is a common law right of access to such records. \nYet the common law right of access is \"not absolute.\" The presumption [ of access] is \njust that, and thus may be rebutted.\" The party seeking to overcome the presumption of \naccess bears the burden of showing \"that the interest in secrecy outweighs the \npresumption. \" The movant must show \"that the material is the kind of information that \ncourts will protect and that disclosure will work a clearly defined and serious injury to the \nparty seeking closure.\" The \"strong presumption of openness does not permit the routine \nclosing of judicial records to the public.\" \nTo overcome that strong presumption , the District Court must articulate \"the \ncompelling , countervailing interests to be protected ,\" make \"specific findings on the \nrecord concerning the effects of disclosure ,\" and \"provide[] an opportunity for interested \nthird parties to be heard.\" \"In delineating the injury to be prevented , specificity is \nessential. \" \"Broad allegations of harm, bereft of specific examples or articulated \nreasoning, are insufficient. \" \"[C]areful factfinding and balancing of competing interests is \nrequired before the strong presumption of openness can be overcome by the secrecy \ninterests of private litigants.\" To that end, the District Court must \"conduct[] a \ndocument-by-document review\" of the contents of the challenged documents. \" \nIn re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prod. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672-73 (3d Cir. 2019) \n( citations omitted). \nPagel of 3 The Court further stated, \"But we have repeatedly said that concern about a company's \npublic image, embarrassment , or reputational injury, without more, is insufficient to rebut the \npresumption of public access.\" Id. at 676. \nI now have before me the sort of dispute that Avandia was meant to address. Echelon \nfiled a seventy-page document of amended counterclaims , including allegations of antitrust \nviolations relating to monopolization. Peloton has submitted a one page letter attempting to \njustify numerous redactions littered throughout the pleading, in about forty separate paragraphs , \nwith a color-coding system to indicate which redaction goes with which of its four categories of \nredactions. Many of the redactions are sought for the clearly improper purpose of attempting to \navoid embarrassment , and they have nothing to do with any plausibly legitimate basis for \nredacting a document . There is no declaration from anyone at Peloton indicating what specific \nharm would occur if the redaction did not occur. As Echelon argues, with some relevant \ncitations, some of the redactions concern items that have already been made public. And, when \nthere is a proposed redaction of something that may or may not be already public, such as the \n$24.5 million paid to Flywheel to settle a lawsuit, the redaction is much broader than just the \ndollar figure. See D.l. 238, Amended Counterclaims , proposed redactions at page 19. \nIn my view, Peloton's half-hearted effort at seeking redactions constitutes a complete \nfailure to justify any redactions at all. My initial inclination was simply to declare Peloton to \nhave waived the issue. But it is also possible that both parties understood my preference for \nshort submissions and thought one-page letters were sufficient. \nThus, unless Peloton makes a further submission, with one or more declarations from \nPeloton personnel (i.e., not Peloton's outside counsel) explaining specifically the harm that each \nredaction will cause and that the substance of the redaction is not already in the public record, the \nPage 2 of 3 disputed pleading will be fully unsealed. Peloton has until Wednesday, January 12, 2022, to \nmake such a submission. Any response from Echelon is due January 19. \nThe letters at D.I. 238 & D.I. 239 (but not the attached Exhibits 1 & 2) are UNSEALED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this '4 day of January 2022. \nPage 3 of 3 "}
