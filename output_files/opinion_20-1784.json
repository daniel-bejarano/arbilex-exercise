{"case_name": "Jackson, M.D. v. Seaspine Holdings Corporation", "case_number": "20-1784", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "02-14-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nROGER P. JACKSON , M.D., \nPlaintiff, \nCivil Action No. 20-1784-RGA \nV. \nSEASPINE HOLDINGS CORPORATION , \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM \nBefore me is Defendant 's Motion to Dismiss. (D.I. 11). Specifically , Defendant moves \nto dismiss Counts One, Two, Eight, Nine, and Ten under Rule 12(b)(7) for failure to join a \nnecessary party; and to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for induced infringement , contributory \ninfringement , infringement under the doctrine of equivalents , and willful infringement under \nRule 12(b)(6). I have reviewed the parties' briefing. (D.I. 12, 16, 17). \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn his First Amended Complaint , Plaintiff Roger P. Jackson, M.D. alleges that Defendant \nSeaSpine Holdings Corporation infringes twelve patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,377,923 (\"the '923 \npatent\"); 10,588,667 (\"the '667 patent\"); 8,540,753 (\"the '753 patent\"); 10,278,740 (\"the '740 \npatent\"); 10,561,445 (\"the '445 patent\"); 10,952,777 (\"the '777 patent\"); 9,662,143 (\"the '143 \npatent\"); 8,298,265 (\"the '265 patent\"); 10,349,983 (\"the '983 patent\"); 10,524,840 (\"the '840 \npatent\"); 10,722,273 (\"the '273 patent\"); and, 9,808,292 (\"the '292 patent\") (together , \"the \nAsserted Patents\"). (D.I. 9). Seven of these patents were asserted in the original complaint; \n1 five (including the '777 and '143 patents) were not. (D.I. 1). The Asserted Patents generally \nrelate to spinal implants and systems used to fixate or align a patient's vertebrae. (D.I. 9 at 17). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nA. Rule 12(b)(6) \nRule 8 requires a complainant to provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) allows the \naccused party to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to meet this standard. A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint \nas true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant , a court concludes that \nthose allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \nThe factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than \nlabels, conclusions , or a \"formulaic recitation \" of the claim elements. Id. at 555 (\"Factual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the \nassumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\"). \nMoreover , there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when \nthe complaint's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)) . \n2 B. Rule 12(b )(7) \nUnder Rule 12(b)(7), a defendant may move to dismiss a case for a plaintiffs failure to \njoin a required party pursuant to Rule 19. To determine whether the case must be dismissed , the \ncourt must first decide whether the party is \"necessary \" within the meaning of Rule 19(a). Gen. \nRefractories Co. v. First State Ins. Co., 500 F.3d 306, 312 (3d Cir. 2007). An absent party is \nnecessary if either, \"( 1) the present parties will be denied complete relief in the absence of the \nparty to be joined, or (2) the absent party will suffer some loss or be put at risk of suffering such \na loss if not joined.\" Koppers Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 158 F.3d 170, 175 (3d Cir. 1998). \nIf the party is necessary under Rule 19(a) andjoinder is feasible, the party is required and \nmust be joined. If the absent party is necessary and cannot be joined, the court must next \ndetermine whether the party is considered \"indispensable \" under Rule l 9(b ). Id If an absent \nparty is indispensable , the court must dismiss the action. Gen. Refractorie s Co., 500 F.3d at \n312. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Failure to Join a Necessary Party \nDr. Jackson licensed five of the twelve Asserted Patents from Alphatec Spine, Inc.-the \n'923 patent (Count One), the '667 patent (Count Two), the '265 patent (Count Eight), the '983 \npatent (Count Nine), and the '840 patent (Count Ten) (together , \"the Alphatec Patents\"). \nSeaSpine moves to dismiss Counts One, Two, Eight, Nine, and Ten under Rule l 2(b )(7) because \nDr. Jackson has failed to join Alphatec as a co-plaintiff. (D.I. 12 at 6). \nOnly a \"patentee\" may bring an action for patent infringement. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 281. A \n\"patentee\" is a party who owns the patent by issuance or assignment. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 l00(d). An \n3 exclusive licensee may only bring an infringement suit in its own name if it holds \"all substantial \nrights\" under the patent. Textile Prods., Inc. v. Mead Corp., 134 F.3d 1481, 1484 (Fed. Cir. \n1998). Otherwise , the patent owner is a \"necessary party\" to the litigation under Rule 19, and \nthe licensee must join the patent owner as co-plaintiff. Id. \nTo determine whether an exclusive licensee possesses all substantial patent rights, courts \n\"must ascertain the intention of the parties and examine the substance of what was granted\" in \nthe license agreement. Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG v. Meccanica Euro Italia SPA, 944 F.2d 870, \n874 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In determining the scope of the rights transferred by the license \nagreement , courts consider the licensee's right to (1) use the patent, (2) sublicense the patent, and \n(3) sue for infringement. See Intell. Prop. Dev., Inc. v. TC! Cablevision of Cal., Inc., 248 F.3d \n1333, 1342-45 (Fed. Cir. 2001). It is also \"helpful to look at what rights were retained by the \ngrantor.\" Prima TekIL L.L.C. v. A-Roo Co., 222 F.3d 1372, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000). \nDr. Jackson alleges that he \"owns substantiall y all rights and interest\" under the Alphatec \nPatents and thus can bring suit in his own name. (D.I. 9 at ,r,r 10, 12, 19, 21, 23). In support, \nDr. Jackson produces the \"Amended and Restated Alphatec Spine License Agreement \" (the \n\"Alphatec Agreement \") and the \"First Addendum to Amended and Restated Alphatec Spine \nLicense Agreement \" (the \"Addendum \"). (D.I. 9-1, Ex. 1; D.I. 26-1). \nThe Addendum provides in relevant part: \nAlphatec Spine hereby grants to Jackson and their successors and assigns an exclusive \n( except as stated below), perpetual license, with the unlimited right for Jackson or their \nsuccessors or assigns to grant sublicenses to third parties [to] the [Alphatec Patents]. \nAlphatec Spine and any successor to substantiall y all of the business of Alphatec Spine \nshall retain the rights to manufacture , sell and distribute products based upon the [ Alphatec \nPatents] but shall not have the right to sublicense the [ Alphatec Patents] to third parties . \n. . . Either party may institute enforcement actions to enforce the [ Alphatec Patents] against \nthird-party infringers and any costs in enforcing the [Alphatec Patents] against third-party \n4 infringers shall be shared equally by the parties and any recovery shall be shared equally; \nhowever, either party may opt out of such infringement enforcement at any time to avoid \nthe costs of enforcement provided that any recovery against third-party infringers shall be \ndivided pro rata based upon each party's respective legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses \nfor such enforcement. ... Other than the mutual promises made and the mutual benefits \nderived from this Agreement , no other consideration shall be paid by Jackson and their \nsuccessors and assigns or their ... sub licensees in connection with the [ Alphatec Patents] \nLicense. \n(D.I. 9-1, Ex. 1, \u00a7 4.0l(g)). \nAlphatec also retains the right to consult on the \"filing and content of any application , \namendment, submission or response\" Dr. Jackson files in connection with the Alphatec Patents \nand the right to file its own applications and amendments to the Alphatec Patents in consultation \nwith Dr. Jackson. (Id.). The Alphatec Agreement provides, \"Jackson may not assign this \nAgreement without the written consent of Alphatec Spine (such consent not to be unreasonably \ndenied) .... \" (D.I. 23-1, \u00a7 13.02). \nDr. Jackson argues that the rights conferred here are similar to the rights conferred in \nSpeedplay , Inc. v. Bebop, Inc., 211 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2000). (D.I. 16 at 5). In Speedplay , the \nlicensee was granted an exclusive, royalty-free right to use and sublicense the patent. \nSpeedplay, 211 F.3d at 1250. The patentee did not retain any rights to practice the patent. Id. at \n1251. The licensee was also granted the right to enforce the patent, and the patentee retained the \nright bring an infringement action if the licensee did not. Id. The Federal Circuit held that the \npatentee's right to sue was \"illusory\" because the licensee \"can render that right nugatory by \ngranting the alleged infringer a royalty-free sublicense .\" Id. Thus, the Federal Circuit held that \nthe licensee had been granted substantially all patent rights and had standing to maintain the suit. \nId. at 1249. \n5 SeaSpine responds that this case is more closely analogous to Abbott Lab ys v. Diamedix \nCorp., 47 F.3d 1128 (Fed. Cir. 1995). (D.I. 12 at 7-8; D.I. 17 at 3). In Abbott, the licensee's \nusage rights were subject to a limited right of the patentee to make, use, and sell products \nembodying the patented invention and to prior licenses granted by the patentee. Abbott, 47 F.3d \nat 1129. The licensee was granted the right to sue for infringement , and the patentee retained \nthe right to bring an infringement action if the licensee did not. Id. at 1132. The licensee could \ngrant sub licenses, but it had to pay annual royalties on the sales of the sub licensees. Id. at 1129. \nThe patentee also retained the right to prevent the licensee \"from assigning its rights under the \nlicense to any party other than a successor in business. \" Id. at 1132. Considering the scope of \nthe rights granted to the licensee and retained by the patentee, the Federal Circuit held that the \nlicensee had not been granted substantially all patent rights. Id. \nI find that the license agreement in this case is closely analogous to the agreement in \nSpeedplay . Dr. Jackson was granted an exclusive, royalty-free right to use and sublicense the \npatent, and the ability to sue for infringement. Although Alphatec retained the right to enforce \nthe patents, this right to sue is \"illusory.\" Dr. Jackson has been granted the unfettered right to \nsub license the Alphatec Patents-he does not have to pay royalties on the sales of the \nsublicensees and Alphatec retained no right to grant sublicenses. Thus, as with the licensee in \nSpeedplay , Dr. Jackson can render Alphatec 's right to sue nugatory by granting the third-party \ninfringer a royalty-free sublicense. \nThe license agreement does provide that Dr. Jackson cannot assign the agreement without \nthe consent of Alphatec. But unlike the patentee's right to restrict an assignment of the \nagreement in Abbott, Alphatec 's consent cannot be unreasonably withheld. Because Alphatec 's \n6 right to restrict any assignment of the agreement is limited, I find that this consent requirement \ndoes not significantly restrict the scope of Dr. Jackson's rights. See Speedplay, 211 F.3d at \n1251-52 (holding that a nearly-identical consent requirement \"does not significantly restrict the \nscope of Speedplay 's rights in the '778 patent\"). \nUnlike the patentee in Speedplay (and similar to patentee in Abbott), Alphatec retained \nthe right to make, use, and sell products embodying the patented invention. While the \npatentee's retention of the right to practice the patent does favor a finding that there was not a \ntransfer of substantially all patent rights, I do not find this fact to be dispositive in this case. Dr. \nJackson has an exclusive , perpetual license to use the patented technology , the unfettered right to \nsub license the patents, and the right to effectively control the enforcement of the patents. \nAlphatec's retention of the right to practice the patents--effectively a non-exclusive license\u00ad\ndoes not significantly restrict the substantial rights granted to Dr. Jackson. See United Access \nTechs., LLC v. Verizon Internet Servs., Inc., 2021 WL 1200650, at *8 (D. Del. Mar. 26, 2021) \n(holding that the grantor's retention of the right to \"exploit\" the licensed patents failed to \nestablish that the granter had standing to maintain an infringement suit without the exclusive \nlicensee). \nThus, I find that Alphatec transferred substantially all the rights in the Alphatec Patents to \nDr. Jackson. Dr. Jackson has standing to maintain this lawsuit without joining Alphatec as a co\u00ad\nplaintiff. SeaSpine 's motion to dismiss Counts One, Two, Eight, Nine, and Ten under Rule \n12(b)(7) is denied. \nB. Induced Infringement \n7 Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b), \"Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall \nbe liable as an infringer.\" Liability under\u00a7 271(b) \"requires knowledge that the induced acts \nconstitute patent infringement. \" Global-Tech Applianc es, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754, 766 \n(2011 ). Thus, \"for an allegation of induced infringement to survive a motion to dismiss, a \ncomplaint must plead facts plausibly showing that the accused infringer specifically intended \nanother party to infringe the patent and knew that the other party's acts constituted \ninfringement. \" Lifetime Indus., Inc. v. Trim-Lok, Inc., 869 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2017) \n( cleaned up) \n1. Knowledge of Infringement \nDr. Jackson alleges that he provided SeaSpine 's CEO, Keith Valentine , \"notice of his \nthreaded spherical shank head technology (which includes U.S. Patent No. 8,540,753)\" at a \nconference in 2017, and \"Mr. Valentine agreed at the time to look into the issue.\" (D.I. 9 at ,r \n33). He also alleges that he had \"discussions throughout the Summer of 2018\" with SeaSpine \nwhere he \"provided notice to SeaSpine that it was engaging in the unauthorized use of Dr. \nJackson's spine implant inventions and exclusively owned technology protected by the '753, \n'292 and '923 patents.\" (Id.). The parties \"discussed SeaSpine 's Mariner product in \nconnection with these patents.\" (Id.). On September 15, 2020, Dr. Jackson sent a letter to \nSeaSpine which \"alerted SeaSpine to each of the Asserted Patents (among others) and pointed \nout that the Mariner, Malibu and NewPort products all required such a license.\" (Id. at ,r 34; see \nalso D.I. 12, Ex. A (providing a copy of this letter)). \nIn the September 15, 2020 letter, Dr. Jackson offered SeaSpine a license for \"his enabling \ntechnologies.\" (D.I. 12, Ex. A at 2). He further stated that if the parties could reach an \n8 agreement without the need for litigation or inter partes review, \"any past infringements would \nbe cured with monthly payments going forward with NO interest.\" (Id.). Otherwise, if Dr. \nJackson did have to file suit, \"any past infringements for sales of the existing Newport, Malibu, \nDaytona and Mariner screws would be paid in one lump sum including accrued interest.\" (Id. at \n2-3). Dr. Jackson attached a list of 67 \"licensable \" patents, including ten of the twelve Asserted \nPatents, namely, the '923, '667, '753, '740, '445, '265, '983, '840, '273, and '292 patents. (Id., \nEx.A). \nIn this letter, Dr. Jackson offers a license, identifies ten Asserted Patents, names the \naccused Newport, Malibu, and Mariner systems, and provides notice of infringement. This is \nsufficient to plead knowledge of the ten patents and their infringement. Thus, Dr. Jackson has \nsufficiently alleged pre-suit knowledge of infringement of these ten patents at least as of \nSeptember 15, 2020. 1 \nThe 2020 letter, however, does not identify the '777 or' 143 patents. Dr. Jackson alleges \nthat SeaSpine had knowledge of the '777 patent because Dr. Jackson offered SeaSpine a license \nto the '753 patent, of which the '777 patent is a continuation. (D.I. 9 at ,r 101). Similarly, Dr. \nJackson alleges that SeaSpine knew of the '143 patent because the '143 patent is a continuation \nof the '272 patent, which was identified in the 2020 letter. (Id. at ,r 109). These allegations are \ninsufficient to support an inference of actual knowledge of the patents, let alone knowledge of \ninfringement. See MONEC Holding AG v. Motorola Mobility, Inc., 897 F. Supp. 2d 225,233 \n(D. Del. 2012) (holding that the fact that the accused infringer had knowledge of a patent related \n1 Although some of the Asserted Patents may be entitled to an earlier start date for induced \ninfringement (see, e.g., D.I. 9 at ,r,r 33, 74), I do not need to decide that for purposes of this \nmotion. \n9 to the patent-in-suit was not sufficient to demonstrate a plausible claim of pre-suit knowledge of \nthe patent-in-suit). Thus, I grant SeaSpine 's motion to dismiss Dr. Jackson's claims for induced \ninfringement of the '777 and '143 patents. \n2. Specific Intent \n\"[S]pecific intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence where a defendant has \nboth knowledge of the patent and specific intent to cause the acts constituting infringement.\" \nRicoh Co. v. Quanta Comput. Inc., 550 F.3d 1325, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \"Evidence of active \nsteps taken to encourage direct infringement , such as advertising an infringing use or instructing \nhow to engage in an infringing use, show an affirmative intent that the product be used to \ninfringe, and a showing that infringement was encouraged overcomes the law's reluctance to find \nliability when a defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for some lawful use.\" \nMetro-Goldwyn-Ma yer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 936 (2005) (cleaned up). \nFor each induced infringement count, Dr. Jackson alleges, with some slight variation, \n\"SeaSpine has the specific intent to encourage surgeons to directly infringe [the Asserted Patents] \nby using and/or assembling components of the Mariner screw products .... SeaSpine provides \nthe components used in the completed bone anchor assembly for the Mariner screw products \nalong with instructions and tools to accomplish this assembly .\" (See, e.g., D.I. 9 at ,r 57). \nSeaSpine argues that this is insufficient to support an inference of specific intent because Dr. \nJackson does not identify the \"instructions and tools,\" allege how SeaSpine provides the \n\"instructions and tools\" to surgeons, or allege how the \"instructions and tools\" relate to the \nAsserted Patents. (D.I. 12 at 13). \n10 SeaSpine 's argument is frivolous. Dr. Jackson's allegations are sufficient to plead \nspecific intent. See, e.g., M2M Sols. LLC v. Telit Commc 'ns PLC, 2015 WL 4640400, at *4 (D. \nDel. Aug. 5, 2015) (holding that an allegation that \"Defendants provided instructions to their \ncustomers on use of those products in a manner that would directly infringe the patent\" was \nsufficient to plead specific intent). Contrary to SeaSpine 's arguments , it is not necessary for Dr. \nJackson allege how SeaSpine provides the \"instructions and tools\" to surgeons or how the \n\"instructions and tools\" relate to the Asserted Patents. \nDr. Jackson has sufficiently alleged facts to state a claim for inducement infringement of \nthe '923, '667, '753, '740, '445, '265, '983, '840, '273, and '292 patents. Thus, I will deny \nSeaSpine 's motion with respect to these patents. \nC. Contributory Infringement \nUnder \u00a7 271 ( c ), \"Whoever offers to sell or sells within the United States or imports into \nthe United States a component of a patented machine ... constituting a material part of the \ninvention , knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an \ninfringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for \nsubstantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer. \" To state a claim for \ncontributory infringement , a complaint must plead facts plausibly showing that (1) \"there is \ndirect infringement ,\" (2) \"the accused infringer had knowledge of the patent,\" (3) \"the \ncomponent has no substantial noninfringing uses,\" and ( 4) \"the component is a material part of \nthe invention.\" Fujitsu Ltd v. Netgear Inc., 620 F.3d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2010). \nAs I concluded above, Dr. Jackson has sufficientl y pled pre-suit knowledge of the '923, \n'667, '753, '740, '445, '265, '983, '840, '273, and '292 patents. Because Dr. Jackson has failed \n11 to plead pre-suit knowledge of the '777 and' 143 patents, I will grant SeaSpine 's motion to \ndismiss Dr. Jackson's contributory infringement claims for these patents. \nDr. Jackson alleges that SeaSpine contributes to the infringement of the Asserted Patents \nby selling the accused screw products to surgeons as part of surgical trays. (See, e.g., D.I. 9 at 1 \n58). He alleges, for example, \"These components, such as the 'pedicle screw' and 'body \nmember' etc., as claimed, comprise material components of the 'variable angle spinal assembly' \nof at least claim 4 of the '923 patent and are designed, configured and adapted to work with each \nother and have no substantial purpose other than as part of infringing devices and are accordingly \nnot staple articles of commerce. \" (Id.). \nSeaSpine argues that Dr. Jackson's allegations are insufficient because he only recites \nexamples of components that contribute to the infringement rather than each component that \ncontributes to the infringement. (D.I. 12 at 16). SeaSpine does not provide any case law that \nrequires a complaint to list each and every component , and I do not think that level of specificity \nis necessary at the pleading stage. Dr. Jackson's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for \ncontributory infringement as he has specifically identified at least a few components that \ncontribute to the infringement. \nSeaSpine also argues that Dr. Jackson has failed to plead sufficient facts regarding lack of \nsubstantial non-infringing uses. (D.I. 12 at 16-17). \"The Federal Circuit has ruled that \naffirmatively pleading the absence of substantial non-infringing uses renders the claim plausible \nif the pleadings do not undermine that allegation. \" Merck Sharp & Dahme Corp. v. Teva \nPharms. USA, Inc., 2015 WL 4036951, at *7 (D. Del. July 1, 2015) (citing In re Bill of Lading, \n12 681 F.3d 1323, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012)), report and recommendation adopted, 2015 WL 4477699 \n(D. Del. July 22, 2015). \nThe First Amended Complaint states that the material components \"are designed, \nconfigured and adapted to work with each other and have no substantial purpose other than as \npart of infringing devices and are accordingly not staple articles of commerce. \" (D.I. 9 at ,r 58). \nThis \"affirmative pleading [ of] the absence of substantial non-infringing uses renders the claim \nplausible.\" Merck Sharp & Dahme, 2015 WL 4036951, at *7; see also Express Mobile, Inc. v. \nSquarespace , Inc., 2021 WL 3772040, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 25, 2021) (holding that the complaint \nmet the plausibility pleading standard where the plaintiff stated that there was no substantial non\u00ad\ninfringing use). \nFor these reasons, SeaSpine 's motion to dismiss Dr. Jackson's contributory infringement \nclaims is denied as to the '923, '667, '753, '740, '445, '265, '983, '840, '273, and '292 patents. \nD. Infringement Under the Doctrine of Equivalents \nDr. Jackson alleges that the accused systems infringe the Asserted Patents \"either literally \nor under the doctrine of equivalents.\" (See, e.g., D.I. 9 at ,r 53). SeaSpine argues that this \nallegation is insufficient to state a claim for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents \nbecause Dr. Jackson does not plead any facts supporting this theory and his infringement charts \nonly demonstrate literal infringement. (D.I. 12 at 18). \nDr. Jackson's allegations are sufficient. \"These disclosures and allegations are enough to \nprovide [SeaSpine] fair notice of infringement of the asserted patents.\" Disc Disease Sols. Inc. v. \nVGH Sols., Inc., 888 F.3d 1256, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2018); see also Promos Techs., Inc. v. Samsung \nElecs. Co., 2018 WL 5630585, at *2 (D. Del. Oct. 31, 2018) (holding that plaintiff is not limited \n13 to the one asserted claim identified in the asserted patent). SeaSpine does not identify an y cases \nin which a doctrine of equivalents allegation has been appropriatel y struck or otherwise \ndismissed at the pleading stage when the allegation accompanies a sufficient literal infringement \nallegation. (D.I. 12 at 18; D.I. 17 at 9). Thus, I deny SeaSpine 's motion to dismiss Dr. \nJackson's claims for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. \nE. Willful Infringement \nSeaSpine moves to dismiss Dr. Jackson's claims for willful infringement . (D.I. 12 at \n19). A determination of willfulness requires a finding of \"deliberate or intentional \" \ninfringement. SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 14 F.4th 1323, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2021). To plead \na claim of willful infringement , the complaint must allege that the accused infringer knew of the \npatent-in-suit , and knowingl y or intentionall y infringed the patent after acquiring that \nknowledge. Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters., Inc., 946 F.3d 1367, 1378-79 \n(Fed. Cir. 2020). \nAs I concluded above, Dr. Jackson has sufficientl y pled knowledge of the patent and \nknowledge of the risk of infringement for the '923, '667, '753, '740, '445, '265, '983, '840, \n'273, and '292 patents. Thus, I will deny SeaSpine 's motion with respect to these patents. \nBecause Dr. Jackson has failed to plead pre-suit knowledge of the '777 and '143 patents, I will \ngrant SeaSpine 's motion to dismiss Dr. Jackson's willful infringement claims for these patents. \nIV.
