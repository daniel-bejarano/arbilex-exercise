BENSON,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      : \n v.     : Civil Action No. 2 1-1369- RGA  \n      : \nROBERT  MAY,  et al.,   :  \n      : \n  Defendant s.   : \n \n \nJoshua D. Benton, James T. Vaughn Correctional  Center, Smyrna, Delaware .   \nPro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n April 13, 20 22 \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Joshua D. Benson, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in \nSmyrna , Delaware,  filed this action pursuant to  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  (D.I. 2).  Plaintiff  \nappears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis.   (D.I. 5).  The \nCourt proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1915(e)(2) (B) and \n1915A(a).      \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff alleges  violations of the Fifth, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when several institutional \n\u201cfalse charges\u201d were filed against him including one on February 22, 2021 for promoting \nprison contraband.  (D.I. 2 at  5, 6),  Named Defendants are Warden Robert May, \nDeputy Warden Phillip  Parker, Hearing Officer Robert Heishman, and Internal A ffairs \nOfficer Orlando DeJesus .  DeJesus and Heis hman investigated the matter , and Plaintiff \nalleges that a fellow inmate told them that Plaintiff had no involvement .  (Id. at 6-8, 7). \nPlaintiff also alleges that there was no physical evidence.    (Id. at 6, 8, 9).   Following a \nhearing, Plaintiff was found guilty.   (Id. at 6 , 8).  Plaintiff alleges that Hei shman did not \nconduct a fair and impartial hearing.  ( Id. at 9).  Heishman r ecommended stripping \nPlaintiff of 90 days earned good- time credits.   (Id.).   Parker concurred with the \nrecommendation.   (Id. at 10).   On February 26, 2021, Mays sent correspondence to the 2 \n Board of Parole and Central Record \u201cinsinuating\u201d that P laintiff was a \u201dprison contraband \npromoter\u201d when there was no illegal contraband to support the allegations.   (Id.).   \n Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief  as well as compensatory  and punitive damages.   \n(Id. at 12). \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or  seeks monetary \nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013) .  See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant) .  The C ourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 8 9, 93 \n(2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. at 94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   3 \n  The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pur suant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)  and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims  for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant P laintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the cl aim \nasserted.  See id . at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 4 \n 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific ta sk that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense. \u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION \n In the prison litigation history section of the Complaint , Plaintiff refers to a case \nhe filed in state court , C.A. No. K21C- 05-020.  (D.I. 2 at 13).  That c omplaint raised \nclaims pursuant to 42 U.S.C . \u00a7 1983 and named as defendants May, Heishman, \nDeJesus, and Parker .  The Court takes judicial notice that the case, Benson, v. May , \nC.A. No. K21C- 05-020 (Del. Super .) at BL -11, filed May 21, 2021, al leges the same \nfacts as the instant case regarding promoting prison contraband, a disciplinary hearing, finding of guilt, and no physical evidence to support the finding, all in violation of the \nFirst, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and \nthe Delaware Constitution.\n2  Id.  Plaintiff sought injunctive relief and compensatory \ndamages .  Id.  On June 14, 2021, the matter was dismissed as factually and legally \nfrivolous .  Id. at BL -9.   The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent \nCounty also found that it plainly appeared form the fac e of the pleading that Plaintiff was \nnot entitled to relief .  Id.   Plaintiff did not appeal.  Instead, he filed the instant case on \nSeptember 22, 2021.  (D.I. 1).  \n \n1 The Court has access to the Superior Court docket via Bloomberg Law. \u201cBL\u201d is how \nBloomberg Law refers to docket entries.  \n2 The pleading is titled as a complaint and sought relief  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  \nId. at BL-1.  The dismissal order referred to the matter as a petition for writ of \nmandamus.  Id. at BL -9.  5 \n  This Court may dismiss, sua sponte, claims barred by res judicata, now referred \nto as claim preclusion . See King v. East Lampeter Twp., 69 F.  App\u2019x 94 (3d Cir . 2003) . \nClaim preclusion bars a party from initiating a second suit against the same adversary \nbased on the same cause of action as the first suit. See In re Continental Airlines, Inc ., \n279 F.3d 226, 232 (3d Cir. 2002); McLaughlin v. Board of Trustees of Nat'l Elevator \nIndus. Health Benefit Plan,  686 F. App\u2019x 118, 121 (3d Cir . 2017).  \n As just  discussed , on May 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a civil action in the Superior \nCourt against the same defendants, raising the same or similar claims to those raised in \nthe instant Complain t including violations of the Fifth, Eight, and Fourteenth \nAmendments  to the United States C onstitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See  \nBenson, v. May , C.A. No. K21C- 05-020 (Del. Super . Ct.).   \n The doctrine of res judicata \u2018protects litigants from the burden of relitigating an \nidentical issue with the same party or his privy and promotes judicial economy by \npreventing needless litigation.\u2019\u201d   Lewis v. Smith , 361 F.  App\u2019x 421, 423 (3d Cir. 2010) . \nThree element s are required:  (1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving \n(2) the same parties or their privies, and (3) a subsequent suit based on the same \ncause of action. In re Mullarkey , 536 F.3d 215, 225 (3d Cir. 2008). Res judicata \u201cbars \nnot only claims that were brought in a previous action, but also claims that could have \nbeen brought.\u201d Duhaney v. Attorney Gen., 621 F.3d 340, 347 (3d Cir. 2010) ( cleaned \nup). 6 \n  The elements are met. First, the State action against was dismissed as factually \nand legally frivolous .3  Dismissal for failure to state a claim is a final judgment on the \nmerits for res judicata purposes. See Federated Dep\u2019 t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie , 452 U.S. \n394, 399 n.3 (1981); Kulick v. Pocono Downs Racing Ass \u2019n, Inc ., 816 F.2d 895, 898 n.6 \n(3d Cir. 1987). Second, Plaintiff  and Defendants  all were parties in the State case. \nFinally, this action is based upon the same cause of action as in the Superior Court  \ncase filed by Plaintiff ,. \n The conditions for claim preclusion are satisfied and, hence, Plaintiff's Complaint  \nwill be dismissed.  \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint as  frivolous  pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) .   Amendment is futile.  \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.  \n \n3 If Plaintiff disagreed, his remedy was to file an appeal, not to refile the same case in \nfederal court.   \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nJOSHUA D. BENSON,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      : \n v.     : Civil Action No. 21- 1369- RGA  \n      : \nROBERT MAY,  et al.,    :  \n      : \n  Defendant s.   : \n \n \nORDER  \n \n At Wilmington this 13th day of April, 2022 , for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \n IT IS ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSE D as frivolous  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B) (i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) .  Amendment is futile.  \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.  \n             \n       /s/ Richard G. Andrews ____________  \n       UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE "}
