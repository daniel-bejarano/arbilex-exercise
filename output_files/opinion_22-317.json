Kardassakis , \nLEWIS BRISBOIS BISGAARD & SMITH LLP, Los Angeles, CA. \nAttorneys for Defendant. \nMarch~' 2023 \n1 Before me is Defendant 's motion to dismiss. (D.I. 12). The motion has been fully briefed, \nand I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 13, 15, 16). I held helpful oral argument on \nDecember 19, 2022. (D.I. 31). For the following reasons, Defendant 's motion is GRANTED in \npart and DENIED in part. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis case arises from a data breach. Defendant Acuity-CHS , LLC d/b/a Comprehensive \nHealth Services, LLC offers medical management solutions, including occupational health \nmanagement services, for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. (D.I. 10 at 7). Plaintiff \nAshley Salas used CHS's services when she applied for a job at the U.S. Customs and Border \nPatrol Agency between late 2018 and early 2019, and again when she applied for a job at the \nTransportation Security Administration in 2021. (Id. at 5). As a part of the employment screening \nprocess, CHS administered medical examinations through a clinic in California. (Id.). To receive \nthose examinations, Ms. Salas gave CHS certain private information. (Id.). CHS stored this \ninformation in its database. (Id.). \nOn September 30, 2020, CHS was the victim of a cyberattack. (Id. at 2). After discovering \n\"fraudulent wire transfers,\" CHS \"detected unusual activity within its digital environment and \npromptly launched an investigation\" to determine the cause, as well as to identify information that \nmay have been accessed or acquired without permission. (Id. at 9). On November 3, 2021, CHS \nlearned that some information-specifically, the names, dates of birth, and Social Security \nnumbers of at least 106,752 patients who had received CHS's services, including Ms. Salas-may \nhave been compromised in connection with the data breach. (Id. at 9-10). On February 11, 2022, \nCHS published a Notification of Data Security Incident, which informed potentially affected \n2 individuals of the breach and explained , \"There is no evidence of the misuse of any information \npotentially involved in this incident.\" (Id.). \nMs. Salas now brings this putative class action in an amended complaint against CHS on \nbehalf of herself and all others similarly situated. (D.I. 10). Her proposed nationwide class \ncomprises \"[a]ll persons whose Private Information was compromised as a result of the Data \nBreach discovered on or about September of 2020 and who were sent notice of the Data Breach.\" \n(Id. at 48). She asserts claims for negligence (Count I), breach of express contract (Count II), \nbreach of implied contract (Count III), unjust enrichment (Count IV), violation of the California \nConfidentiality of Medical Information Act, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 56.10 et seq. (2008) (Count V), \nviolation of California's Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 et seq. (Count \nVI), and violation of the California Customer Records Act, Cal. Civ. Code\u00a7 1798.80 et seq. (Count \nVII). (Id. at 53-74). She also seeks a declaratory judgment \"concluding that CHS owed, and \ncontinues to owe, a legal duty to employ reasonable data security to secure the Sensitive \nInformation,\" and \"prospective injunctive relief requiring [CHS] to employ adequate security \npractices consistent with law and industry standards to protect consumer and patient private \ninformation \" (Count VIII). (Id. at 75-78). \nMs. Salas alleges that CHS's failure to secure her private information put her \"at a serious, \nimmediate, and ongoing risk of ... fraud and identity theft.\" (Id. at 3). One such attempt, she \nclaims, has already taken place. (Id. at 6). On February 28, 2022, Ms. Salas's identity theft \nprotection software notified her that her email address had been used in an identity theft attempt. \n(Id.). Ms. Salas also alleges that the breach \"resulted in costs and expenses ... associated with the \ntime spent addressing and attempting to ameliorate \" the release of the information , as well as \"the \nemotional grief associated with the substantial and imminent risk of falling victim to identity theft \n3 and having to constantly monitor personal banking and credit accounts. \" (Id.). She alleges future \ninjuries as well, which include mitigation costs, stress, and the loss of property value of her \npersonal information. (Id.). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nA. Rule 12(b)(l) \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(1) permits the dismissal of a claim or an action for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. A Rule 12(b)(l) motion may be treated as either a facial or \nfactual challenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d \n333,346 (3d Cir. 2016). A facial attack contests the sufficiency of the pleadings , whereas a factual \nattack contests the sufficiency of jurisdictional facts. See Lincoln Ben. Life Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, \n800 F.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir. 2015). When considering a facial attack, the court accepts the plaintiffs \nwell-pleaded factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences from those allegations \nin the plaintiffs favor. See In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data Breach Litig., 846 F.3d 625, \n633 (3d Cir. 2017). When reviewing a factual attack, the court may weigh and consider evidence \noutside the pleadings , see Gould Elecs. Inc. v. United States , 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000), \nand the party asserting subject matter jurisdiction bears \"the burden of proof that jurisdiction does \nin fact exist.\" Id. \nB. Rule 12(b)(6) \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nthe Court must accept the complaint 's factual allegations as true. See Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, \nbut they must provide more than labels, conclusions , or a \"formulaic recitation \" of the claim \n4 elements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in \nfact).\"). Moreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to \nrelief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when \nthe complaint 's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant 's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\" ( cleaned up)). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nCHS makes approximately nineteen distinct arguments in its twenty-page opening brief. \n(D.I. 13). Unsurprisingly , these arguments are not fully developed in the briefing. Prior to oral \nargument, in compliance with my order (D.I. 23), CHS identified the five arguments that it \nconsiders most important . (D.I. 26). The five arguments are as follows: (1) Ms. Salas fails to meet \nthe injury-in-fact requirement for Article III standing; (2) Ms. Salas fails to meet the traceability \nrequirement for Article III standing; (3) Ms. Salas's negligence claim is barred by the economic \nloss doctrine; ( 4) Ms. Salas fails to state a claim for breach of contract \"because she has not \nidentified the terms of the alleged contract, formation of a contract based on those terms, or \ndamages resulting from a breach of those terms\"; and (5) Ms. Salas fails to state a claim for unjust \nenrichment \"because she has not conferred a benefit directly on CHS, the retention of which by \nCHS was unjust.\" (Id.). These were the arguments that the parties developed at oral argument. \n(D.I. 31). The other arguments I hereby dismiss as cursorily made and without prejudice to being \nraised at the summary judgment stage. \n5 A. Article III Standing \nCHS argues that Ms. Salas's claims fail for lack of standing. (D.I. 13 at 4-7). I disagree. \nArticle III Standing to sue is a threshold requirement in every federal case. Warth v. Seldin, \n422 U.S. 490,498 (1975). Standing is necessary for subject matter jurisdiction. Susan B. Anthony \nList v. Driehaus , 573 U.S. 149, 157-58 (2014). To establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate: \n\"(1) that he or she suffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent , \n(2) that the injury was caused by the defendant , and (3) that the injury would likely be redressed \nby the requested judicial relief.\" Thole v. US. Bank NA., 140 S. Ct. 1615, 1618 (2020) (citing \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). CHS challenges the first two \nstanding requirements . \n\"Standing is meant to serve as 'an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy \nrequirement of Article III,\"' and is therefore \"analyticall y distinct from the merits of the underlying \ndispute.\" Davis, 824 F.3d at 348 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). The Third Circuit has \n\"repeatedly cautioned against allowing a Rule 12(b )(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction to be turned into an attack on the merits.\" Davis, 824 F.3d at 348 (discussing standing). \nOnly in \"narrow categories of cases\" may courts dismiss under Rule 12(b)(l) for merits-related \ndefects. Id. at 349-50. Courts may do so 'where the alleged claim under the Constitution or federal \nstatutes clearly appears to be immaterial . . . or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and \nfrivolous.\"' Id. at 350 (quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682-83 (1946)). \"[W]hen a case raises \na disputed factual issue that goes both to the merits and jurisdiction, district courts must 'demand \nless in the way of jurisdictional proof than would be appropriate at a trial stage.\"' Id. \nThus, in reviewing facial challenges to standing, I am limited to \"a screening for mere \nfrivolity\" and must take care not to conflate the standing inquiry with an assessment of the merits \n6 of Plaintiff's claim. Adam v. Barone, 41 F.4th 230, 234 (3d Cir. 2022). Factual challenges to \nstanding-which flip the burden of persuasion to the plaintiff and allow a defendant to attack the \nallegations in the complaint using contrary evidence, all without the procedural safeguards of Rule \n12(b)(6)-pose a particular risk of prejudice to the plaintiff. See Davis, 824 F.3d at 348-49. \nConsequently , and in light of the \"tightly circumscribed\" category of cases in which courts may \ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction based on merits considerations , \"dismissal via a Rule 12(b)(l) \nfactual challenge to standing should be granted sparingly.\" Id. at 350. \n1. Injury-in-fact \n\"To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered 'an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest' that is 'concrete and particularized ' and 'actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical. \"' Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (quoting Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 560). At the motion to dismiss stage, \"the injury-in-fact element is not Mount \nEverest.\" Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 767 F.3d 247, 278 (3d Cir. 2014) (cleaned up). The \ncontours of this standard \"are very generous\"; Plaintiffs must only allege \"some specific, \nidentifiable trifle of injury.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nCHS argues that the injuries that Ms. Salas alleges are neither concrete nor imminent. (D.I. \n12 at 4-5). I address each requirement in tum. \na. Imminence \nTo satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement, the alleged injury must be \"actual or imminent , \nnot conjectural or hypothetical. \" Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"That \n'actual or imminent ' is disjunctive is critical: it indicates that a plaintiff need not wait until he or \nshe has actually sustained the feared harm in order to seek judicial redress, but can file suit when \nthe risk of harm becomes imminent.\" Clemens v. ExecuPharm Inc., 48 F.4th 146, 152 (3d Cir. \n7 2022). For imminence, allegations of future injury \"suffice if the threatened injury is 'certainly \nimpending' or there is a 'substantial risk' that the harm will occur.\" Susan B. Anthony List, 573 \nU.S. at 158 (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int'! USA, 568 U.S. 398,414 n.5 (2013)). \nThe Third Circuit recently addressed the injury-in-fact requirement in the data breach \ncontext in Clemens, 48 F.4th at 152-59. In Clemens, a known hacking group infiltrated the \ndefendant 's servers, stole sensitive information pertaining to the plaintiff and others, held the \ninformation for ransom, and ultimately published that information on the Dark Web. Id. at 150. \nThe plaintiff alleged a variety of injuries, first and foremost being an increased risk of identity \ntheft and fraud. Id. at 151. The Third Circuit explained that, in determining whether such an injury \nis imminent or hypothetical , courts should consider the following factors: (1) whether the data \nbreach was intentional , (2) whether the data was misused, and (3) \"whether the nature of the \ninformation accessed through the data breach could subject a plaintiff to a risk of identity theft.\" \nId. at 153-54. These factors are non-exhaustive , and no single factor is dispositive to the inquiry. \nId. at 153. Notably, the Third Circuit explained that the second factor-misuse-is \"not \nnecessarily required.\" Id. at 154 ( citing Pisciotta v. Old Nat 'l Bancorp, 499 F .3d 629, 634 (7th Cir. \n2007), in which the Seventh Circuit held there was standing despite no allegations of misuse). \nApplying the factors, the Third Circuit held that the plaintiffs allegations of future injury were \nsufficiently imminent. Id. at 157. The court noted that the hackers \"intentionally gained access to \nand misused the data\" by publishing it online, and that the compromised data-a combination of \nfinancial and personally identifying information-were \"the type of data that could be used to \nperpetrate identity theft or fraud.\" Id. \nMs. Salas alleges that her private information was \"accessed and viewed ... with the intent \nof selling it and/or using it fraudulently to profit from such use.\" (D.I. 10 at 11 ). Ms. Salas alleges \n8 actual misuse of her private information. She claims that it is \"for sale to criminals on the dark \nweb\" (id.), and that the risks associated with such misuse-such as attempted identity theft-have \nalready begun to materialize. (Id. at 6). In particular , Ms. Salas alleges that, in February 2022, she \n\"received an alert through her identity theft monitoring service that her email address had recently \nbeen used in a potential identity theft incident.\" (Id. at 46). Furthermore , the nature of the \ninformation here is sensitive. Indeed, the Clemens court recited \"social security numbers, birth \ndates, and names\"-the personal information at issue in this case-as examples of information \nthat is \"more likely to create a risk of identity theft or fraud\" if compromised. 48 F.4th at 154. \nThus, like the plaintiff in Clemens, Ms. Salas has alleged a future injury that is sufficiently \nimminent. \nCHS disagrees. (D.I. 13 at 5). It argues that this case is distinguishable from Clemens, and \nthat the facts here more closely resemble those in Reilly v. Ceridian Corp., 664 F.3d 38 (3d Cir. \n2011 ), another data breach case in which the Third Circuit held that the plaintiff's allegation of \nfuture harm was insufficientl y imminent for standing. Id. at 46. There, the plaintiffs alleged a risk \nof future identity theft or fraud stemming from a data breach in which an unknown hacker \npotentially accessed sensitive personal and financial information (including names, Social Security \nnumbers, and birth dates) from the defendant 's computer network. Id. at 40. The plaintiffs did not \nallege any actual misuse. Id. at 43. The Third Circuit found that plaintiffs ' alleged risk was too \nhypothetical for standing purposes ; the risk depended on \"entirely speculative , future actions of an \nunknown third party.\" Id. at 42 (\"Appellants ' contentions rely on speculation that the hacker: (1) \nread, copied, and understood their personal information; (2) intends to commit future criminal acts \nby misusing the information ; and (3) is able to use such information to the detriment of Appellants \nby making unauthorized transactions in Appellants ' names.\"). \n9 CHS argues that, like the plaintiffs in Reilly, Ms. Salas does not allege actual misuse of her \ninformation. (D.I. 12 at 5). This portion of CHS's argument , as I understand it, attacks the \nsufficiency of Ms. Salas's pleadings without disputing the facts alleged, and therefore constitutes \na facial challenge. See Davis, 824 F.3d at 346. Accepting the allegations of the complaint as true \nand drawing all reasonable inferences in Ms. Salas's favor, as I must do when presented with a \nfacial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction , id., I come to the opposite conclusion . Unlike the \nReilly plaintiffs, Ms. Salas has alleged actual misuse. (E.g., D.I. 10 at 11 (\"Plaintiff's and Class \nmembers ' Private Information is for sale to criminals on the dark web\")). Besides, as the Third \nCircuit recently stated, \"misuse is not necessaril y required\" to establish injury-in-fact in a data \nbreach case. Clemens, 48 F.4th at 154. Where misuse is absent, the presence of other factors may \nnevertheless confer standing. Id. Those other factors are present here, to varying degrees. Ms. Salas \nalleges that unauthorized parties intentionall y accessed her data 1 (D .I. 10 at 11 ), and that those data \ninclude sensitive information , such as her Social Security number, birth date, and first and last \nname. (Id.). I therefore conclude that Ms. Salas has alleged an injury that is sufficiently imminent \nfor standing. \n1 CHS argues that Ms. Salas has not satisfied this factor, as the intent of the breach was wire fraud \n(i.e., to steal money electronically from CHS), not identity theft. (D.I. 16 at 3; D.I. 31 at 15-16). \nCHS points to CHS's Notification of Data Security Incident, which Ms. Salas included in her \nComplaint. (D .I. 10 at 9-10). The Notification of Data Security Incident stated that information \nbelonging to Ms. Salas and others may have been impacted in connection with an incident \ninvolving \"unusual activity within its digital environment following discovery of fraudulent wire \ntransfers.\" (Id.). Thus, says CHS, \"the scheme here was to perpetuate wire transfer fraud against \nCHS.\" (D.I. 16 at 3). \nI understand CHS' s argument here to be a component of its facial challenge to standing. I \ntherefore accept Ms. Salas's well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable \ninferences from those allegations in her favor. See in re Horizon, 846 F.3d at 633. Applying this \nstandard, I find that it is reasonable to infer that a malicious third party who intentionally infiltrated \nCHS's system to use CHS's financial data to steal from CHS would also target the private data of \nMs. Salas and others. b. Concreteness \nFor concreteness, the central inquiry 1s \"whether the asserted harm has a 'close \nrelationship ' to a harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American \ncourts-such as physical harm, monetary harm, or various intangible harms.\" Trans Union LLC v. \nRamirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021). Where a suit is premised on \"the mere risk of future harm,\" \na court must consider the type of relief sought. Id. at 2210-11. If the plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, \nthe allegation of a risk of future harm can qualify as concrete, if the risk is \"sufficiently imminent \nand substantial. \" Id. at 2210. But in a suit for damages, an allegation of a risk of future harm, \nstanding alone, is insufficient ; such plaintiffs must also allege that \"the exposure to the risk of \nfuture harm itself causes separate concrete harm\" in order to satisfy concreteness. Id. at 2211. \nThe Third Circuit has stated that, \"in the data breach context, where the asserted theory of \ninjury is a substantial risk of theft or fraud, a plaintiff suing for damages can satisfy concreteness \nas long as he alleges that the exposure to that substantial risk caused additional, currently felt \nconcrete harms.\" Clemens, 48 F.4th at 155-56. A plaintiff sufficiently supports such harms by \nalleging that, for example, \"the plaintiffs knowledge of the substantial risk of identity theft causes \nhim to presently experience emotional distress or spend money on mitigation measures like credit \nmonitoring services.\" Id. Such was the case in Clemens, in which the plaintiff alleged \"emotional \ndistress and related therapy costs and the time and money involved in mitigating the fallout of the \ndata breach.\" Id. at 158. The Third Circuit held that the plaintiffs alleged injury was sufficiently \nconcrete. Id. (noting that \"the harm involved is sufficiently analogous to harms long recognized at \ncommon law like the 'disclosure of private information. '\" (citing Trans Union, 141 S. Ct. at 2204)). \nHere, Ms. Salas alleges the same additional harms. Among other things, she alleges \"[a]nxiety and \ndistress\" due to her fear that her private information will be misused (D.I. 10 at 48), and\"[ c ]urrent \n11 and future costs in terms of time, effort and money\" spent mitigating the impact of the data breach. \n(Id. at 47-48). I have already concluded that her injury is \"sufficientl y imminent and substantial. \" \nClemens, 48 F.4th at 2210. Accordingl y, I conclude that Ms. Salas has alleged an injury that is \nconcrete enough for standing. \n2. Traceability \nCHS contends that Ms. Salas has failed to satisfy the traceability requirement for standing, \nas the potential misuse of Ms. Salas's email address is not fairly traceable to CHS's conduct. (D.I. \n12 at 7). CHS' s argument is that, because Ms. Salas's email address was not affected by the data \nbreach, she cannot draw a causal connection between the alleged misuse of her email address and \nCHS's conduct. (Id.). For support, CHS offers the declaration of Jeffrey Rupert, senior legal \ncounsel of CHS's parent company. (D.I. 13-1, Ex. A). CHS points to Mr. Rupert's statement that \nthe information compromised in the data security incident did not involve Ms. Salas's email \naddress. (Id. at 2). In response, Ms. Salas points to the \"mosaic effect,\" by which cybercrirninals \npiece together multiple data sources to reveal new private information about individual. (D.I. 10 \nat 6, 30-31; D.I. 15 at 8). She asserts that this is how identity thieves obtained her email address\u00ad\nby using the information compromised in the data breach. (D.I. 10 at 6). CHS counters that this \nargument is not plausible, as someone attempting identity theft who has accessed the victim's \nSocial Security number would have no reason to use the victim's email address. (D.I. 16 at 1). \nAs CHS asks me to weigh and consider evidence outside the pleadings , its argument \nconstitutes a factual attack, rather than a facial attack, on standing. See Gould Elecs., 220 F.3d at \n176. The disputed factual issue-the relationship between CHS's conduct and the alleged misuse \nof Ms. Salas's email address-\"goes both to the merits and jurisdiction. \" See Davis, 824 F.3d at \n350. I may grant such challenges where the plaintiff's claim \"is wholly insubstantial and \n12 frivolous.\" Bell, 327 U.S. at 682-83. Such seems to be the case here. Although the traceability \nrequirement \"'does not mean that plaintiffs must show to a scientific certainty that defendant 's \n[actions], and defendant's [actions] alone, caused the precise harm suffered by plaintiffs,\"' \nInterfaith Cmty. Org. v. Honeywell Int'!, Inc., 399 F.3d 248, 257 (3d Cir. 2005) (cleaned up), \nplaintiffs must nevertheless show that their injuries \"relate directly\" to the defendant 's conduct. \nSee id. As I do not think Ms. Salas's \"mosaic effect\" theory amounts to more than mere speculation \nregarding CHS's involvement in the attempted identity theft incident regarding her email address, \nI do not think that the email incident is \"fairly traceable\" to CHS. \nThis conclusion , however, does not help CHS. As Ms. Salas points out (D.I. 31 at 25), \nCHS' s traceability argument only addresses the narrow issue of misuse as it relates to Ms. Salas's \nemail address. Ms. Salas makes other allegations of misuse, including misuse of the information \ndirectly impacted by the data breach-her name, date of birth, and Social Security number-which \nshe alleges are \"for sale on the Dark Web.\" (D.I. 10 at 11). And Ms. Salas need not allege actual \nmisuse for standing purposes, provided that other factors recited in Clemens-such as the intent \nof the breach and the nature of the compromised information, 47 F.4th at 153-54--weigh in her \nfavor. As discussed , I believe that they do. \nAccordingly , I conclude that Ms. Salas has Article III standing, and I deny CHS's motion \nto dismiss her claims for lack of standing. \nB. Negligence \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff's negligence claim is barred by Delaware 's economic loss \ndoctrine. (D.I. 12 at 9-10).2 That doctrine precludes a party from bringing a negligence claim if the \n2 Plaintiff brought this action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2). (D.I. 10 at 7). \"A federal court sitting \nin diversity applies the choice-of-law rules of the forum state ... to determine the controlling law.\" \nManiscalco v. Brother Intern. (USA) Corp., 709 F.3d 202,206 (3d Cir. 2013). \n13 alleged losses are only economic in nature-i.e. , \"divorced from any injury to person or property.\" \nBrayv. Gamestop Corp., 2018 WL 11226516 , at *4 (D. Del. Mar. 16, 2018). Delaware courts have \ndefined economic loss as \"any monetary loss, costs of repair or replacement , loss of employment, \nloss of business or employment opportunities, loss of good will, and diminution in value.\" \nMcKenna v. Terminex Intern Co., 2006 WL 1229674, at *4 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 13, 2006). \nThe purpose of the economic loss doctrine is to preclude tort claims \"where overlapping \nclaims based in contract adequately address the injury alleged.\" Brasby v. Morris, 2007 WL \n949485, at *6 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 29, 2007). The doctrine's underlying principle is \"the notion \nthat contract law provides a better and more specific remedy than tort law.\" Id. As such, Delaware \ncourts have held that tort and contract claims might coexist where \"a defendant breached a duty \nthat is independent of the duties imposed by the contract.\" McKenna , 2006 WL 1229674 at *2. As \nMs. Salas does not argue that she has claimed a breach of a duty independent of the contractual \nobligations central to her breach of contract claims, I do not address that issue here. \nThe economic loss doctrine bars Ms. Salas's negligence claims to the extent that her claims \nare for purely economic losses. CHS argues that her negligence claims are for purely economic \nlosses and are therefore barred. (D.I. 13 at 9). Ms. Salas argues that she has alleged certain non\u00ad\neconomic losses. (D.I. 31 at 51 ). First, she says that the alleged loss of value of her private \ninformation is a non-economic injury to property and thus lies beyond the scope of the economic \nloss doctrine. (Id. at 51-52). I disagree. This court has held that diminution of the value of personal \nBoth parties' briefs cite Delaware law. (See, e.g., D.I. 13 at 9-10; D.I. 15 at 12-14). Thus, \nwithout deciding the choice of law issue, I will presume that Delaware law applies. See Zazzali v. \nHirsch/er Fleischer , P. C., 482 B.R. 495, 517 (D. Del.2012) (\"Due to the complexity of [the choice \nof law] analysis, when confronted with a choice of law issue at the motion to dismiss stage, courts \nwithin the Third Circuit have concluded that it is more appropriate to address the issue at a later \nstage in the proceedings.\"). \n14 information is an economic loss, rather than property damage. Bray, 2018 WL 11226516 at *4 \n(dismissing negligence claim in data breach case as barred by Delaware's economic loss doctrine). \nMs. Salas cites to In re Marriott Int'/, Inc., Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 440 F. Supp. 3d 447 \n(D. Md. 2020) for the proposition that \"the growing trend across courts ... is to recognize the lost \nproperty value of [personal] information. \" Id. at 460-61. The Marriott Court, however, said this in \nthe context of its Article III standing analysis. Id. The Court ultimately declined to decide the \neconomic loss doctrine issue, id. at 476, and in any event, its discussion of that doctrine was in the \ncontext of Illinois law. See id. at 467-76. Thus, I think that case is inapplicable here. \nMs. Salas also argues that her allegations based on emotional harm are non-economic. (D.I. \n31 at 51 ). CHS counters that these allegations are insufficient because Ms. Salas does not support \nthem with allegations of physical injury. (D.I. 13 at 10). \"It is settled law in Delaware that, in a \nnegligence action, for a claim of mental anguish to lie, an essential ingredient is present and \ndemonstrable physical injury.\" Collins v. African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, 2006 WL \n1579718, at *6 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 31, 2006); see also Brzoska v. Olson, 668 A.2d 1355, 1362 \n(Del. 1995). Counter to Ms. Salas's assertions at oral argument (D.I. 31 at 52-53), neither \"the \nemotional grief associated with the substantial and imminent risk or falling victim to identity theft \nand having to constantly monitor personal banking and credit accounts \" (D.I. 10 at 3) nor \"the \nstress, nuisance, and aggravation of dealing with all issues resulting from the Data Breach\" (id.) \nconstitute physical harm. I agree with Defendant that the cases that Ms. Salas relies upon in support \nfor such damages being recoverable are inapposite. (D.I. 16 at 6). Both cases-Dannunzio v. Lib. \nMut. Ins. Co., 2021 WL 5177767 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 8, 2021) and TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. 2190 \n(2021 )-involved Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) claims, rather than negligence, and neither \n15 case involved Delaware law. 3 Thus, Ms. Salas's arguments with respect to emotional harm fail as \nwell. \nI therefore grant CHS' s motion to dismiss Count I. \nC. Breach of Contract Claims \nCHS argues that Ms. Salas has failed to state a claim for breach of contract. (D .I. 13 at 11-\n12). I agree with respect to Ms. Salas's breach of express contract claim, but not with respect to \nher breach of implied contract claim. \nTo survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a breach of contract claim, the plaintiff \nmust demonstrate: \"(1) the existence of an express or implied contract; (2) a party breached the \nobligation imposed by the contract; and (3) any damages that the plaintiff incurred as a result of \nthe breach.\" Saunders v. E.J duPont de Nemours & Co., 2014 WL 7051078, at *4 (D. Del. Dec. \n12, 2014). An express contract is expressed in writing or orally, whereas an implied contract \"is \nproven through conduct rather than words .\" Chase Manhattan Bank v. Iridium Africa Corp., 239 \nF. Supp. 2d 402,407 (D. Del. 2002). \nMs. Salas's second and third claims assert a breach of express contract, (D.I. 10 at 58-61), \nand, in the alternative, a breach of implied contract. (Id. at 61-66). As an initial matter, I disagree \nwith CHS's argument that these claims are mutually exclusive. (D.I. 13 at 12). CHS cites Chase \nManhattan Bank, in which the court held that \"a party may not simultaneously allege an implied-\n3 Similar problems arise with respect to the other cases Ms. Salas cites in support of her negligence \nclaims. Ms. Salas cites Frunzi v. Paoli Servs., Inc., 2012 WL 2691164 (Del. Super. Ct. July 6, \n2012) for the proposition that \"once a plaintiff establishes that a defendant breached the duty of \ncare, the defendant is liable for all consequential damages flowing from that breach.\" (D.I. 15 at \n12). But the cited analysis in Frunzi pertained only to damages for breach of contract and did not \ninvolve emotional harms. Id. at *8. And Ms. Salas cites Opris v. Sincera Reprod. Med., 2022 WL \n1639417 (E.D. Pa. May 24, 2022) for the proposition that mitigation costs stemming from a data \nbreach are compensable in negligence . (D.I. 15 at 13). But that case involved Pennsylvania law, \nid. at *3, and the economic loss doctrine was not at issue. \n16 in-fact and express contract based on the same terms or embracing the same subject matter.\" 239 \nF. Supp. 2d at 408. That case, however, is inapposite. There, the dispute arose at the summary \njudgment stage, and the court based its decision on the impracticalities of presenting both theories \nat trial. Id. at 410-11. Here, at the motion to dismiss stage, Ms. Salas may allege both claims as \nalternative theories ofrecovery . See FED. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2)-(3). \n1. Breach of Express Contract \nIn her complaint , Ms. Salas alleges that the parties entered an express contract \"under \nwhich Plaintiff and other class members agreed to provide their Private Information to Defendant , \nand Defendant agreed to provide medical exam services and protect Plaintiff and Class members ' \nPrivate Information .\" (D.I. 10 at 58-59). Ms. Salas derives this contract from multiple \"express \ncontracts\" between Ms. Salas and CHS-specifically , she identifies \"HIP AA privacy notices and \nexplanation of benefits documents \" (id. at 59), as well as a presentation made by CHS' s parent \ncompany in May 2020 . (Id. at 31 ). \nCHS contends that Ms. Salas's breach of express contract claim fails because she \"fails to \naver any particular contract terms that she contends [were] breached .\" (D.I. 13 at 11-12). I agree. \nUnder Delaware law, a plaintiff bringing a breach of contract action must plead the existence of \n\"sufficiently specific terms that determine the obligation of each party.\" Tani v. FPL/Next Era \nEnergy, 811 F. Supp. 2d 1004, 1023 (D. Del. 2011). Ms. Salas fails to do so. She provides no detail \nas to the terms of the \"HIP AA privacy notices and explanation of benefits documents \"-she \nmerely avers that these documents exist. (D.I. 10 at 59). Ms. Salas does provide portions of the \nMay 2020 presentation by CHS's parent company, (id. at 12-13), but it is not clear from the \nallegations why this presentation matters; Ms. Salas does not say who the audience of this \n17 presentation was, and in any event, the presentation was delivered by CHS's parent company , and \nnot by CHS. \nThese allegations are not sufficient to allege a breach of express contract.4 I therefore grant \nCHS' s motion to dismiss Count II. \n2. Breach of Implied Contract \nCHS argues that, as with Ms. Salas's breach of express contract claim, Ms. Salas fails to \nallege the existence a contract, as she has not identified any particular contract term that CHS \nmight have breached. (D.I. 12 at 11). \n\"[T]he elements required to form an implied-in-fact contract are identical to those required \nfor an express agreement , that is offer, acceptance , and consideration. \" Chase Manhattan Bank, \n239 F. Supp. 2d at 408. There must be a 'meeting of the minds,' and \"the parties' mutual assent to \nthe contract terms must be objectively manifest or shown.\" Id. \nMs. Salas alleges, \"Through their course of conduct, Defendant , Plaintiff, and Class \nmembers entered into implied contracts for the provision of health care services, as well as implied \ncontracts for the Defendant to implement data security adequate to safeguard and protect the \nprivacy of Plaintiff's and Class members ' Private Information. \" (D.I. 10 at 61). Ms. Salas alleges \nthat she paid money (id. at 67) and gave her private information (id. at 58-59) in exchange for \nCHS' s services. 5 \n4 I am unconvinced by Ms. Salas's argument that, \"[b ]ecause the parties' contractual intent relates \nto multiple documents , the express agreement is a question of fact that will need to be further \nexplored in discovery. \" (D.I. 15 at 15-16). At issue here is the sufficienc y of the factual allegations , \nnot the sufficiency of the evidence, and Ms. Salas has failed to adequatel y allege that these \ndocuments constitute an express contract. \n5 CHS points to Mr. Rupert's declaration , in which he says, \"Job applicants do not make any \npayments to CHS ... for preplacement exams.\" (D.I. 13-1, Ex. A at 2). In its briefing, CHS makes \nno argument that Ms. Salas has failed to adequatel y allege the consideration element of her breach \n18 Neither party cites to Delaware case law addressing this issue. Other courts have reached \na variety of conclusions. Compare Castillo v. Seagate Tech., LLC, 2016 WL 2980242, at *9 (N.D. \nCal. Sept. 14, 2016) (\"While [Defendant] made no explicit promises as to the ongoing protection \nof personal information, it is difficult to imagine how, in our day and age of data and identity theft, \nthe mandatory receipt of Social Security Numbers or other sensitive personal information would \nnot imply the recipient 's assent to protect the information sufficiently .\"), and In re Target Corp. \nData Sec. Breach Litig., 66 F. Supp. 3d 1154, 1176 (D. Minn. 2014) (holding that the plaintiffs \nhad sufficiently pleaded \"an implied contract in which Plaintiffs agreed to use their credit or debit \ncards to purchase goods at Target and Target agreed to safeguard Plaintiffs ' personal and financial \ninformation \"), with Lovell v. P.F Chang's China Bistro, Inc., 2015 WL 4940371 , at *3 (W.D. \nWash. Mar. 27, 2015) (dismissing breach of implied contract claim in data breach case). As the \nquestion appears unsettled , in the interest of caution, I conclude that Ms. Salas has sufficiently \npled the existence of an implied contract. See Bray, 2018 WL 11226516 , at *6 (allowing plaintiffs ' \nof contract claim. Ms. Salas, in her opposition brief, appears to maintain that she paid for CHS' s \nservices. (See D.I. 15 at 18). \nAt oral argument , however, Ms. Salas conceded that, in view of Mr. Rupert's declaration , \n\"it looks like there may not have been an exchange of money between Ms. Salas and CHS.\" (D.I. \n31 at 32). CHS then raised a consideration challenge, arguing that Ms. Salas's private information \nis inadequate consideration for the alleged contract. (Id. at 43). \nThis argument, however meritorious it might be, is of no moment here. I must \"accept all \nfactual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and \ndetermine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint , the plaintiff may be entitled to \nrelief.\" Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224,231 (3d Cir. 2008). Although I may consider \n\"undisputedly authentic documents attached to a motion to dismiss\" in making my determination, \nDelaware Nation v. Pennsylvania , 446 F.3d 410, 413 n. 2 (3d Cir. 2006), I may only do so if the \nclaims in the complaint are \"based\" on the extrinsic document---otherwise , Defendant 's motion \nmust be treated as a motion for summary judgment. Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241,249 (3d Cir. \n2014) (cleaned up). As Ms. Salas did not use Mr. Rupert's declaration in framing her complaint , \nand as I do not think that treating CHS' s motion as a motion for summary judgment is warranted , \nI decline to consider Mr. Rupert's declaration. I will therefore assume, for the purposes of this \nopinion, that Ms. Salas paid CHS for its services. \n19 breach of implied contract claim to proceed at the motion to dismiss stage, reasoning that it is \n\"prudent to proceed with caution at this early stage, especially with the lack of consensus among \nthe courts\"); In re Rutter's Inc. Data Security Breach Litigation , 511 F. Supp. 3d 514, 537 (M.D. \nPa. 2021) (same). \nCHS next argues that Ms. Salas has not sufficiently alleged that CHS breached any \nobligations under, for example, the HIP AA privacy notices and explanation of benefits documents , \nas these documents \"do not guarantee that CHS' s network will remain free from data breaches \nfrom third-party cybercriminals. \" (D.I. 13 at 12). But Ms. Salas does not allege that CHS made \nany such guarantee. What Ms. Salas alleges is that CHS promised to \"reasonably protect \n[Plaintiffs] Private Information\" and that \"[its] data security practices complied with relevant laws \nand regulations , and were consistent with industry standards.\" (D.I. 10 at 62). Ms. Salas alleges \nthat CHS breached this promise by choosing to \"ignore\" industry standards , (id. at 37), and \n\"fail[ing] to comply with safeguards mandated by HIPAA regulations. \" (Id. at 33). These \nallegations are sufficient. \nFinally, CHS contends that Ms. Salas has failed to allege damages resulting from the \nalleged breach. (D .I. 13 at 11-12). Ms. Salas alleges several damages theories in her complaint. \nFirst, she alleges \"benefit of the bargain\" damages-she \"received healthcare and other services \nthat were of a diminished value to that described in the contracts\" as the result of CHS' s failure to \nfulfill its data security promises, and she would not have provided her private information to CHS \nhad CHS disclosed its security deficiencies. (D.I. 10 at 65). Second, she alleges \"actual damages \nand injuries\" including the release, disclosure , and loss of control of her private information , as \nwell as the imminent risk of future damages, disruption of medical care and treatment, and out-of\u00ad\npocket expenses. (Id. at 66.) \n20 CHS contends that Ms. Salas's alleged \"benefit of the bargain\" damages do not properly \nsupport her claim, as \"she has not shown the medical services she received or the level of protection \nof her information was worth less than what she expected when she provided her information. \" \n(D.I. 12 at 11). Ms. Salas replies that CHS's argument is immaterial because she is entitled to \nrecover nominal damages for the breach of contract. (D.I. 15 at 17). This seems true enough. Under \nDelaware law, a party bringing a breach of contract claim must allege \"first, the existence of the \ncontract ... ; second, the breach of an obligation imposed by that contract; and third, the resultant \ndamage to the plaintiff.\" VLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 840 A.2d 606,612 (Del. 2003). \nWith respect to the third element, however, \"[a] party need not plead cognizable damages ,\" as \n\"[ a ]11 that is required is cognizable harm, and the breach of a contract right gives rise to cognizable \nharm.\" In re P3 Health Group Holdings, LLC, 2022 WL 16548567 , at *30 (Del. Ch. Oct. 31, \n2022); Garfield on behalf ofODP Corporation v. Allen, 277 A.3d 296,328 (Del. Ch. 2022) (\"[A] \nplaintiff need not plead monetary damages to sustain a breach of contract claim. The plaintiff need \nonly plead causally related harm, which the plaintiff can accomplish by pleading a violation of the \nplaintiffs contractual rights.\"). As already discussed , Ms. Salas has sufficiently pleaded breach of \ncontract; I am therefore unmoved by CHS' s argument as to her damages . \nFor the reasons stated above, I conclude that Ms. Salas has adequatel y stated a claim for \nbreach of implied contract. I therefore deny CHS' s motion to dismiss as to this claim. \nD. Unjust Enrichment \nCHS contends that Ms. Salas fails to allege an unjust enrichment claim. (D.I. 12 at 12-13). \nI disagree. \nUnjust enrichment is \"the unjust retention of a benefit to the loss of another, or the retention \nof money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good \n21 conscience.\" Fleer Corp. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., 539 A.2d 1060, 1062 (Del. 1988). In \nDelaware, the elements of equitable claim of unjust enrichment are: \"(l) an enrichment , (2) an \nimpoverishment , (3) a relation between the enrichment and impoverishment, ( 4) the absence of \njustification, and (5) the absence of a remedy provided by law.\" Nemec v. Shrader, 991 A.2d 1120, \n1130 (Del. 2010). \nMs. Salas alleges that CHS has wrongfully retained money that Ms. Salas paid in exchange \nfor services that CHS-by failing to adequately safeguard Ms. Salas's private information-did \nnot provide.6 (D.I. 10 at 67-69). This is sufficient. \nCHS's first argument to the contrary is that, because Ms. Salas's unjust enrichment claim \nis \"based on the same conduct as the breach of conduct claims,\" Ms. Salas has not adequately \nalleged the absence of a legal remedy as required under the fifth element. (D.I. 12 at 12-13). At \noral argument, Ms. Salas said that she pleads her unjust enrichment claim in the alternative to her \nbreach of contract claims. (D.I. 31 at 59). She may do so. Under Delaware law, \"it is permissible \nfor a party to seek quasi-contractual relief in the alternative to its contract claims.\" Hiller & Arban, \nLLC v. Reserves Mgmt., LLC, 2016 WL 3678544, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. July 1, 2016). Delaware \nstate courts generally allow such alternative pleading \"when there is doubt surrounding the \nenforceability or the existence of the contract.\" Albert v. Alex. Brown Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2005 WL \n2130607, at *8 (Del. Ch. Aug. 26, 2005).7 I think that is the case here. Thus, I am not persuaded \nby CHS' s first argument. \n6 Ms. Salas does not allege in her complaint that her private information was a benefit conferred \nupon (and wrongfully retained by) CHS. This theory arose primarily at oral argument. (See D.I. \n31 at 59-60). \n7 Furthermore , I am not sure that I am bound by state court practice. \"[A] federal court hearing a \ndiversity of citizenship action [that is, a claim based on state law] should not be bound by a state \nlaw requiring that an election be made at the pleading stage, because a local practice of this type \n22 CHS' s second argument is that Ms. Salas has not adequately alleged a relation between the \nenrichment and impoverishment , as is required under the third element. (D.I. 13 at 13). To the \nextent that CHS's argument is that Ms. Salas has not shown that her personal information \nconstituted a \"benefit\" conferred to CHS (see D.I. 16 at 9), I am unconvinced . As discussed , I \naccept as true Ms. Salas's allegation that she paid CHS money for its services, and money certainly \nbenefits CHS. CHS contends that even under this assumption , Ms. Salas's claim fails because she \n\"has not shown the cost of the exam was higher because it included payment for data protection \nor that CHS's retention of payment for physical exam services provided is unjust.\" (D.I. 13 at 13). \nThe case it relies upon for this point-In re Am. Med. Collection Agency Customer Data Sec. \nBreach Litig., 2022 WL 5937742 (D.N.J. Dec. 16, 2021 )-is inapposite . There, the court dismissed \nthe plaintiffs ' unjust enrichment claim because the plaintiffs failed to allege that the defendant was \nbenefitted by collecting plaintiffs ' personal data. Id. at* 18. Here, CHS is alleged to have received \nMs. Salas's money in addition to her personal information. (D.I. 10 at 67; see also D.I. 15 at 18). \nMore to the point, as explained with regard to Ms. Salas's breach of implied contract claim, I \nbelieve that Ms. Salas has sufficiently alleged that the services she paid for included data security \npractices consistent with industry standards and compliant with relevant laws and regulations. This \nis sufficient to establish the requisite \"relation \" under the third element. \nI will therefore allow Ms. Salas to proceed on her claim of unjust enrichment as an \nalternative theory of recovery to her breach of contract claim. Thus, I deny CHS's motion to \ndismiss Ms. Salas's unjust enrichment claim. \nmight cripple the flexible pleading provisions sanctioned by Rule 8( d)(2) and defeat the overriding \nfederal policy of having disputes determined on their merits.\" 5 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & \nARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE\u00a7 1283 (4th ed. 2022). \n23 IV.
