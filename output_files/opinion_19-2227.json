Beskrone, Chapter 7 Trustee of Ocimum Biosolutions\nInc. (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) bring a breach of contract claim (in Count I) against Defendant\nLG Chemical Ltd. (\u201cLG Chem\u201d), and misappropriation of trade secrets claims (in Counts II and\nIII) against LG Chem and additional Defendants Abion, Inc. (\u201c\u201cAbion\u201d) and Gencurix, Inc.\n(\u201cGencurix\u201d and collectively with Abion, \u201cA&GC\u201d). Pending before the Court are: (1) LG\nChem\u2019s motion to dismiss the SAC (the \u201cLG Chem motion to dismiss\u2019\u2019); and (2) A&GC\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss the SAC (the \u201c\u201cA&GC motion to dismiss\u201d) and to strike (the \u201cA&GC motion to\nstrike,\u201d and together with the LG Chem motion to dismiss and the A&GC motion to dismiss, the\n\u201cMotions\u201d)). (D.I. 96; D.I. 101) For the reasons set forth below, the Court recommends that the\nLG Chem motion to dismiss be GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART, and that the\nA&GC motion to dismiss be GRANTED. A&GC\u2019s motion to strike is DENIED as MOOT.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual Background\n1. The Parties and Relevant Non-parties\n\nPlaintiff Ocimum Biosolutions (India) Limited (\u201cOcimum\u201d) is an entity organized and\nexisting under the laws of India with a place of business in Hyderabad, India. (DI. 90\n(hereinafter, \u201cSAC\u201d\u2019) at | 1) Plaintiff Don A. Beskrone is the Chapter 7 trustee for the estate of\nOcimum Biosolutions, Inc. (\u201cOcimum USA\u201d), Ocimum\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, and a debtor under\nchapter 7 of title 11 of the United States Code. (/d. at {{] 2, 70) Non-party Gene Logic was a\nDelaware corporation; its genomics division was purchased by Ocimum and Ocimum USA on\nOctober 14, 2007. (dd. at \u00a7\u00a7 20, 70) Gene Logic developed a genetic biological database called\nGeneExpress (the \u201cGeneExpress Product\u201d), which it licensed to drug companies for the purpose\nof streamlining testing in the pharmaceutical development process. (/d. at | 17)\n\nDefendants LG Chem, Abion and Gencurix are, respectively, each South Korean\ncorporations with principal places of business in Seoul, Korea. (/d. at {\u00a7] 3-5) Neither Abion or\nGencurix are current or former licensees of Ocimum or its predecessor, Gene Logic. (/d. at\n135)\n\n2. Relevant Agreements\n\nOn October 15, 2000, Gene Logic and LG Chem entered into an Agreement, referred to\nherein as \u201cthe Access Agreement.\u201d (/d. at 18) Pursuant to the Access Agreement, LG Chem\ngained access to the GeneExpress Product, comprising, inter alia, the \u201cOncology Datasuite\u201d and\n\ncertain Gene Logic software, which are alleged to be trade secrets. (/d. at {| 18, 49-50)!\n\n| The Access Agreement is attached as Exhibit A to the SAC, (SAC, ex. A), and is\nto be construed and interpreted under the laws of the State of Delaware, (SAC at \u00a7 48).\n\n2\nOn or about December 6, 2002, Gene Logic sent a termination letter (the \u201ctermination\nletter\u2019) to LG Chem. (/d. at { 26) The termination letter was consistent with Gene Logic\u2019s\ncorporate-wide termination procedures that it followed with customers who did not renew their\nlicense. (/d. at \u00a7 27) The termination letter stated in part:\n\nPursuant to Section 5.2 (a) of the [Access Agreement], access to\n\nthe GeneExpress[] Product (Oncology DataSuite and the Gene\n\nLogic[] Software) is limited to the term of the agreement.\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to Section 7.1 (c), please ship the\n\nGeneExpress[] Product (all system and data disks containing Gene\n\nLogic\u2019s oncology data and all software programs, including any\n\nAPIs) back to my attention by January 15th. Additionally, please\n\ndestroy or erase all Gene Logic[] data on CD[s], hard disks, or\n\ntapes that were created or transferred to LG Biomedical Institute\n\nduring the Term that contain the Oncology data and provide a\n\nletter to me certifying such destruction by January 15th.\nCd. at 26) The termination of the Access Agreement required LG Chem to stop using Gene\nLogic\u2019s proprietary data and it required LG Chem to transfer all the data it had been accessing\nback to Gene Logic, so that this data could no longer be accessed and used. (/d. at | 28) The\nAccess Agreement in fact terminated on December 31, 2002. (/d. at 4 25)\n\nOn January 15, 2003, employees of LG Chem and Gene Logic had a meeting in\nGaithersburg, Maryland; LG Chem employee Dr. Sang Seok Koh attended the meeting on behalf\nof LG Chem. (d. at \u00a7 29) During this meeting, the companies discussed the \u201c\u201cGeneExpress[]\nDatabase Wrap Up\u201d and \u201cLG Chem provided repeated assurances, through its statements and\nconduct, to Gene Logic that LG Chem had complied with its contractual termination obligations\nand had returned or destroyed all required information as requested in the December 6, 2002\ntermination letter.\u201d (/d. at ff 29-30) Plaintiffs allege, however, that despite these\n\nrepresentations, \u201cLG Chem secretly kept a copy of the Oncology Datasuite, which LG Chem\n\ncontinued to use long after the [Access] Agreement expired without paying the required access\nfee to Gene Logic.\u201d (/d. at \u00a7\u00a7 31, 33) Gene Logic was unaware that this occurred, and instead\nwas led to believe that LG Chem had complied with its termination obligations. (/d. at J] 42, 46)\n\nOn October 14, 2007, Ocimum and Ocimum USA executed an Asset Purchase\nAgreement with Gene Logic, whereby Plaintiffs purchased Gene Logic\u2019s genomics division. (/d.\nat \u00a7 70) On December 17, 2007, Gene Logic and Ocimum USA executed an Assignment and\nAssumption Agreement, whereby Gene Logic assigned to Ocimum USA all rights, title,\nobligations, and interest in certain contracts to which Gene Logic was a party, including the\nAccess Agreement. (/d. at \u00a7] 74; D.I. 25, ex. 8)\n\nIn or around January 2019, Abion and Gencurix were assigned U.S. Patent No.\n10,304,561 (the \u201c561 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 9,639,660 (the \u201c660 patent\u201d), and patent\napplication 16/129,206 (the \u201c'206 application\u2019\u2019) from several persons/entities, including Seoul\nNational University. (SAC at \u00a7\u00a5 132, 180)\n\n3. Post-Transaction Publications\n\nIn 2007, several months before Plaintiffs acquired Gene Logic (and thus GeneExpress),\nDr. Koh was one of several authors who published an article entitled \u201cExpression profile of tight\njunction protein claudin 3 and claudin 4 in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma with prognostic\ncorrelation\u201d (the \u201c2007 Article\u201d). (/d. at 82) This article notes, inter alia, that \u201c[e]xpression\nvalues of tumor and normal tissue biopsies were obtained from the GeneExpress Oncology\nDatasuite[] of Gene Logic Inc., based on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 array set.\u201d (Id.\nat \u00a7 83) LG Chem did not seek nor receive permission from Ocimum, or its predecessor Gene\nLogic, to publish the article. (/d. at | 85)\n\nOn August 22, 2012, LG Life Sciences, a then-affiliate of LG Chem (and an entity that\n\nlater merged with LG Chem in or around 2017), filed U.S. patent application number 13/591,301\n(the \u201c2012 LG Life Sciences Application\u201d\u2019); this application states that it relies on data from the\nGeneExpress Oncology Datasuite of Gene Logic. (/d. at J] 93, 130) LG Life Sciences did not\nseek consent from or provide notice to Ocimum before filing this patent application. (/d. at \u00a7 95)\n\nOn July 21, 2014, LG Life Sciences and several other entities including Seoul National\nUniversity published an article titled \u201cNewly Identified Cancer-Associated Role of Human\nNeuronal Growth Regulator 1 (NEGR1).\u201d (id. at \u00a7 102) The article (the \u201c2014 Article\u2019) stated,\ninter alia, that \u201c[t]he expression values of tumor biopsies and normal tissues were obtained by\nanalyzing GeneExpress Oncology Datasuite[] from Gene Logic (Gaithersburg, USA)[.]\u201d (/d.\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). LG Life Sciences did not seek consent from or provide\nnotice to Ocimum before publishing the article. (/d. at \u00a5 104)\n\nNear the time of the publication of the 2014 Article, Seoul National University R&DB\nFoundation (the \u201c\u201cFoundation\u201d) filed U.S. patent application 13/631,279 (the \u201c'279 Foundation\nApplication\u201d), which stated that:\n\n[I]Jn order to search for candidate housekeeping genes (HKG)\n\nwhose expression is maintained on similar levels in most tissues,\n\nfirst, datasets were constructed using EST and SAGE human gene\n\nexpression data collected from the publicly available CGAP site\n\n(The Cancer Genome Project, http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/) and\n\nmicroarray gene expression data obtained from the GeneExpress\n\nOncology Datasuite[] of Gene Logic Inc., based on the Affymetrix\n\nHuman Genome U133 array set.\nCd. at { 107) The '279 Foundation Application claims priority to a Korean patent application\nfiled on December 27, 2006, which includes the same reference, quoted above, to the Oncology\nDatasuite. (/d. at \u00a7] 108) Neither LG Chem nor Seoul National University sought or obtained\npermission from Ocimum before filing this application. (/d. at 4 113)\n\nOn January 10, 2019, the '206 application was published as U.S. Patent Publication\n\n2019/0012429 \u201cin the name of\u2019 Abion and Gencurix; it too stated reliance on data from the\nGeneExpress Oncology Datasuite of Gene Logic. (/d. at \u00a7\u00a7 132-33, 147-50) LG Chem\nemployee Dr. Koh is a named inventor on this patent. (/d. at \u00a7] 132)\n\nAdditional relevant factual allegations will be discussed below in the appropriate portions\nof Section II.\n\nB. Procedural Background\n\nOn December 5, 2019, Ocimum filed the initial Complaint in this case; in that pleading,\nthe Defendants included LG Chem, LG Life Sciences and two other entities (LG Corp. and LG\nChem Life Sciences Innovation Center, Inc.). (D.I. 2) LG Corp. and LG Life Sciences were\nlater dismissed voluntarily from the case. (D.I. 14)\n\nOn March 11, 2021, United States District Judge Maryellen Noreika issued a\nMemorandum Opinion (the \u201cMarch 11, 2021 MO\u201d) granting the then-current Defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss. (D.I. 46; D.I. 47) On March 23, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended\nComplaint, which now named only the three current Defendants. (D.I. 48) And on December\n17, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the operative SAC. (D.I. 90)?\n\nAs was noted above, the SAC contains three causes of action:\n\ne Count I: Breach of contract\u2014i.e., breach of the Access\nAgreement\u2014against LG Chem. (SAC at {| 186-200)\n\ne Count II: Misappropriation of trade secrets under the Delaware\nUniform Trade Secrets Act (\u201cDUTSA\u201d) against all Defendants.\n(Id. at $9 201-16)\n\ne Count III: Misappropriation of trade secrets under the Defend\nTrade Secrets Act (\u201cDTSA\u201d) against all Defendants. (/d. at {J\n217-26)\n\n2 Plaintiffs had previously filed a prior version of the SAC, but this pleading was\n\nstricken by the Court. (See D.I. 88; D.I. 94) Plaintiffs were subsequently given leave to file the\noperative version of the SAC. (See D.I. 89)\nOn January 21, 2022, LG Chem and A&GC filed the Motions. (D.I. 96; D.I. 101) On\nJanuary 24, 2022, Judge Noreika referred the Motions to the Court for resolution. (D.I. 103)\nBriefing was completed on the Motions on February 24, 2022. (D.I. 116; 117)?\n\nIL. DISCUSSION\n\nIn the portions of their respective motions to dismiss that are filed pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Defendants each argue, for various reasons, that each of\nCounts I-III should be dismissed. The Court will address those Rule 12(b)(6) arguments first.\nNext, the Court will take up the portion of A&GC\u2019s motion to dismiss in which they argue,\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), that the claims against them should be\ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. Lastly, the Court will address A&GC\u2019s motion to\nstrike.\n\nA. Defendants\u2019 Arguments for Dismissal Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)\n\n1. Legal Standards Regarding Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8, 9(b)\nand 12(b)(6)\n\nThe sufficiency of pleadings for non-fraud claims is governed by Rule 8, which requires\n\u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 8(a)(2).\n\nIf a Rule 12(b)(6) movant asserts that the plaintiffs complaint fails to plead sufficient\n\nfacts necessary to set out a plausible claim, then the reviewing court conducts a two-part\n\n3 In their briefing, Plaintiffs argue that LG Chem\u2019s opening brief was untimely filed\n\n(it was filed 12 minutes late due to technical issues), and that its motion to dismiss must be\ndenied on that basis. (D.I. 108 at 6-7) The Court has previously addressed this issue via a\nFebruary 17, 2022 Order, in which it: (1) granted LG Chem\u2019s motion for a post-filing extension\nof time to file its opening brief; and (2) explained why Plaintiffs\u2019 decision to make this request\nfor dismissal showed incredibly poor judgment. (D.I. 114) It will not further address the issue\nhere.\nanalysis. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009). First, the court\nseparates the factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the complaint\u2019s well-\npleaded facts as true, but [disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d Jd. at 210-11. Second, the court\ndetermines \u201cwhether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has\na \u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d Jd. at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009)).*\nIn assessing the plausibility of a claim, the court must \u201cconstrue the complaint in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint,\nthe plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d /d. at 210 (quoting Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515\nF.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008)).\n\nHowever, with regard to a claim alleging fraud or mistake, there a plaintiff must meet the\nmore stringent pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Fed. R. Civ. P.\n9(b). Rule 9(b) mandates that the \u201ccircumstances constituting fraud or mistake\u201d be \u201c\u2018state[d] with\nparticularity[.]\u201d Jd.; see also Frederico v. Home Depot, 507 F.3d 188, 200 (3d Cir. 2007). To do\nso, a party \u201cmust plead or allege the date, time and place of the alleged fraud or otherwise inject\nprecision or some measure of substantiation into a fraud allegation.\u201d Frederico, 507 F.3d at 200.\n\nSometimes, as here, a movant attempts to utilize a Rule 12(b)(6) motion in order to argue\n\nthat a claim should be dismissed in light of the applicability of an affirmative defense. Under\n\n4 In resolving a motion to dismiss, a court typically considers the allegations in the\n\ncomplaint, the exhibits attached thereto, documents or facts that are incorporated by reference\ninto the complaint or that are otherwise integral to the complaint\u2019s allegations, matters of public\nrecord and items for which the court can take judicial notice. See Siwulec v. JM. Adjustment\nServs., LLC, 465 F. App\u2019x 200, 202 (3d Cir. 2012); ING Bank, fsb v. PNC Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc.,\n629 F. Supp. 2d 351, 354 (D. Del. 2009). In their briefing, as will be further addressed below,\nthe parties routinely cite to extra-record documents/facts that do not fall into any of these\ncategories. To the extent they have done so, the Court has not considered those documents/facts\nherein in assessing Rule 12(b)(6) arguments for dismissal.\nRule 8, a complaint \u201cneed not anticipate or overcome affirmative defenses; thus, a complaint\ndoes not fail to state a claim simply because it omits facts\u201d that would defeat an affirmative\ndefense.\u201d Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241, 248 (3d Cir. 2014). In other words, litigants need not\n\u201cplead around\u201d potential affirmative defenses. Id. at 252; see also Wiggins v. Albert Einstein\nMed. Ctr., No. 20-3129, 2022 WL 1197015, at *2 (3d Cir. Apr. 22, 2022); Moretti v. Hertz\nCorp., C.A. No. 14-469-LPS, 2017 WL 1032783, at *3 (D. Del. Mar. 17, 2017). That said,\n\u201cTt]his principle does not categorically preclude courts from considering the application of an\naffirmative defense at the pleading stage.\u201d Moretti, 2017 WL 1032783 at *3. Indeed, courts\nmay grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion in light of an affirmative defense, but only where \u201cthe\naffirmative defense clearly appears on the face of the pleading.\u201d Frasier-Kane v. City of Phila.,\n517 F. App\u2019x 104, 105 n.1 (3d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see\nalso DuBose v. Wyndham Vacation Resorts, Inc., Civil Action No. 20-1118-CFC, 2021 WL\n3145206, at *2 (D. Del. July 26, 2021); Moretti, 2017 WL 1032783 at *3.\n2. Discussion\n\nHaving set out the relevant legal standards, the Court will now address Defendants\u2019 Rule\n\n12(b)(6) arguments as to Counts I, II and III in turn.\na. Count I (Breach of Contract)\n\nWith Count I, Plaintiffs bring a breach of contract claim, pursuant to Delaware law,\nagainst only LG Chem. Under Delaware law, a plaintiff states a breach of contract claim by\nalleging facts supporting the following elements: (1) the existence of a contract, whether express\nor implied; (2) the breach of an obligation imposed by that contract; and (3) resultant damages to\nthe plaintiff. Pharm. Corp. of Am. v. Askari, C.A. No. 16-1123-RGA-MPT, 2018 WL 2108200,\n\nat *5 (D. Del. May 7, 2018); Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, L.L.C., 971 A.2d 872, 883 (Del. Ch.\n2009). Delaware law states that there is a three-year statute of limitations applicable to such\nclaims. Del. Code Ann. Tit. 10, \u00a7 8106. A breach of contract claim \u201caccrues at the time of the\nwrongful act, even if the plaintiff is ignorant of the cause of action.\u201d Erisman v. Zaitsev, C.A.\nNo. 2020-0903-JRS, 2021 WL 6134034, at *12 (Del. Ch. Dec. 29, 2021) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\nIn Count I, Plaintiffs allege that LG Chem breached the Access Agreement in various\nways, such as by:\n\ne \u2018{C]ontinuing to possess, have access to, and make use of the\nGeneExpress[] Product or technology derived therefrom, and\nits associated databases, after expiration of the [Access]\nAgreement[,]\u201d (SAC at \u00a5 191);\n\ne \u2018{R]evealing Plaintiffs\u2019 proprietary information to Chungnam\nNational University, Seoul National University, Abion,\nGencurix and other third parties without the knowledge or\nconsent of Plaintiffs[,]\u201d (id. at \u00a7 194);\n\ne \u2018{S]haring results or other information derived from its usage\nof the GeneExpress[] Product with Chungnam National\nUniversity, Seoul National University, Abion, Gencurix and\nother third parties without the knowledge or consent of\nPlaintiffs[,]\u201d (id. at \u00a7] 195);\n\ne \u201c[A]llowing collaborators access to and use of Plaintiffs\u2019\nproprietary information and information derived therefrom[,]\u201d\n(id. at | 196);\n\ne \u201c[A]llowing collaborators access to and use of results or other\ninformation derived from its usage of the GeneExpress[]\nProduct[,]\u201d (id. at \u00a7 197), and;\n\ne \u2018\u201c{P]ublishing information regarding Ocimum\u2019s proprietary\ninformation without seeking or obtaining Plaintiffs\u2019 consent to\ndo so[,]\u201d (id. at { 198).\n\nWith its Motion, LG Chem argues that Count I must be dismissed because an affirmative\n\ndefense is evident from the face of the SAC\u2014namely, that Count I\u2019s allegations are time-barred.\n\n10\n(D.I. 102 at 5) More specifically, LG Chem argues that because Plaintiffs filed suit on\nDecember 5, 2019, Plaintiffs must allege contractual breaches occurring after December 5, 2016\nin order to avoid a time-bar; it asserts that Plaintiffs have failed to do so. (/d.)\n\nIn responding, Plaintiffs make two arguments. First, they argue that they have, in fact,\nalleged breaches of the Access Agreement that took place after December 5, 2016. (D.I. 108 at\n7) Second, they argue that, with regard to any alleged breaches that occurred before this date, a\ntolling doctrine applies to those portions of the claim. The Court will address both arguments in\nturn.\n\ni. Pleading Post-December 5, 2016 Breaches of Contract\nby LG Chem\n\nWith regard to Plaintiffs\u2019 first argument, it is not well taken. In claiming that they\nalleged post-December 5, 2016 breaches by LG Chem, Plaintiffs initially point to paragraph 193\nof the SAC; there, Plaintiffs simply stated that \u201cLG Chem has breached the [Access] Agreement\nwithin three years of this lawsuit being filed and continues to breach the agreement still today.\u201d\n(SAC at \u00a7 193 (cited in D.I. 108 at 7)) But that is simply a bald assertion, not a fact-based\nallegation. And the Court is not obligated to accept such bald assertions as true. Chemtech Int\u2019l,\nInc. v. Chem. Injection Techs., Inc., 170 F. App\u2019x 805, 808 (3d Cir. 2006); Morse v. Lower\nMerion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nOtherwise, in attempting to find support for this argument, Plaintiffs cite not to the SAC,\nbut instead to something that LG Chem wrote in a prior brief; according to Plaintiffs, in that\nbrief, LG Chem \u201c\u2018admit[ted] that it transferred Ocimum\u2019s technology to Abion and Gencurix on\n\nor about June 21, 2018.\u201d (D.I. 108 at 7 (citing D.I. 51 at 9)) In fact, in this LG Chem brief\n(which was filed back in April 2021), LG Chem stated only that \u201cAbion and Gencurix ... .\nacquired\u201d the '206 application \u201cafter... December 5, 2016.\u201d (D.L. 51 at 9)\u00b0\n\nThe Court does not see how this reference to content from a prior LG Chem brief can\nhelp Plaintiffs here. For one thing, this prior brief is not the SAC, nor an exhibit attached to the\nSAC, or anything like that. And so it is not a part of the record that a Court typically looks to for\nkey facts necessary to resolution of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. But even putting that aside, the brief\ndoes not say that LG Chem was involved in this 2018 acquisition of the '206 application. Nor is\nsuch a thing alleged in the SAC. (See D.I. 116 at 2); see also Chemtech Int'l, Inc., 170 F.

Indeed, in the SAC, Plaintiffs\nalleged only that \u201cAbion and Gencurix were assigned . . . the '206 application from several\npersons/entities including Seoul National University.\u201d (SAC at \u00a7] 180)\u00b0\n\nAs far as the Court can tell, there is no mention in the SAC of any wrongful post-\nDecember 5, 2016 activity undertaken by LG Chem that amounts to a breach of the Access\nAgreement. Most of the wrongful conduct described in the SAC that is attributed to LG Chem\n(or its employees or affiliates) dates either from the time period in 2003 just after the termination\n\nof the Access Agreement, (SAC at {J 30-37, 42-45), or relates to the publication of certain\n\n5 The LG Chem brief does not say exactly when A&GC actually acquired that\napplication, but it appears undisputed that this occurred in June 2018. (D.I. 108 at 7; D.I. 116 at\n2)\n\n6 LG Chem asserts that, in fact, A&GC acquired the '206 application directly from\nindividual inventors, not LG Chem. (D.I. 108 at 7 & exs. 5-6; D.I. 116 at 2)\n\n12\narticles or applications in 2007-14\u2019\u2014such as the 2007 Article, (id. at {| 82-87), or the 2012 LG\nLife Sciences Application, (id. at {| 93-97), or the 2014 Article, (id. at {| 102-04), or the '279\nFoundation Application, (id. at J] 107-14). As to all of those allegations, there cannot be any\ncredible way to discern an assertion of breach occurring any time after 2014.\n\nIt is true that the SAC does go on to reference the publication of the '206 application in\nJanuary 2019, which is of course a time period after December 5, 2016. (/d. at \u00a7 132-37, 144,\n147-55) But that application is not alleged to have been filed by LG Chem. And when it comes\nto alleging a breach of contract by LG Chem that has anything to do with the '206 application,\nthe SAC simply asserts that LG Chem would have breached the Access Agreement if it had\ndisclosed protected material relevant to the '206 application to A&GC or to third parties \u201cbefore\nDecember 31, 2007 [in violation of] confidentiality provisions of [Section] 7.2 of the [Access]\nAgreement.\u201d (/d. at \u00a7 134 (emphasis added)) In other words, the SAC simply does not clearly\nallege a post-December 5, 2016 breach of contract by LG Chem that relates in any way to the\n\n'206 application.\n\n7 Even as to these articles and applications, sometimes LG Chem\u2019s alleged breaches\n\nare asserted to have come much earlier than the actual date of publication. For example, the\nlatest of these articles/applications to be published was the '279 Foundation Application, which\nwas filed in 2014. (SAC at | 107) But LG Chem\u2019s alleged breach of the Access Agreement\nrelating to this application is not clearly alleged to have come in 2014. After all, the\napplication\u2019s 2014 filer was the Foundation, not LG Chem. (/d. at \u00a7 107) And although the SAC\nalleges that \u201c[n]either LG Chem nor Seoul National University provided notice to Ocimum as\nrequired by [Section] 7.5 of the [Access] Agreement before filing [the '279 Foundation\nApplication,]\u201d (id. at \u00a7 114), the SAC does not explain (and the Court does not currently\nunderstand) how LG Chem could be said to have violated Section 7.5 of the Access Agreement\nin 2014 if it was not the entity that filed the '279 Foundation Application in that year. (See id.,\nex. A at \u00a7 7.5) In the Court\u2019s view, the only clear allegation of breach in the SAC relating to this\napplication comes in paragraph 110, where the SAC asserts that LG Chem is alleged to have\nbreached the Access Agreement back on December 27, 2006\u2014when Dr. Koh allegedly provided\na copy of the Oncology Datasuite to the Foundation. (SAC at J 110)\n\n13\nIn light of all of this, and after carefully reviewing all of the paragraphs of the SAC, the\nCourt concludes that the most recent-in-time breach of contract that could possibly be attributed\nto LG Chem relates to the 2014 Article\u2019s publication on July 21, 2014 by LG Life Sciences (an\nentity that later merged with LG Chem). (dd. at \u00a7\u00a7 102-04 (alleging that this is a violation of\nSection 7.5 of the Access Agreement))\u00ae And so facially, the SAC\u2019s breach of contract\nallegations all appear to have accrued as of dates outside of the relevant three-year statute of\nlimitations period.\n\nii. Pleading the Applicability of a Tolling Doctrine\n\nThis brings us to Plaintiffs\u2019 second argument: that a tolling doctrine applies, such that the\nrelevant statute of limitations was suspended. Delaware courts? recognize three tolling\ndoctrines: (1) the doctrine of inherently unknowable injuries, (2) the doctrine of fraudulent\nconcealment, and (3) the doctrine of equitable tolling. Ausikaitis ex rel. Masimo Corp. v. Kiani,\n962 F. Supp. 2d 661, 674 (D. Del. 2013) (citing In re Tyson Foods, 919 A.2d 563, 584-85 (Del.\n\nCh. 2007)). Ifa tolling doctrine applies, \u201cthe statute of limitations begins to run upon the\n\n8 The Court did find one reference in paragraph 129 of the SAC as to how \u201c[t]o the\nextent information contained in publications identified herein is not based on permissible use of\ninformation under the [Access] Agreement, on information and belief, LG Chem and other third\nparties who improperly obtained Plaintiffs\u2019 proprietary information from or through LG Chem\ncontinue to use this proprietary information still today in violation of the express and\nunambiguous terms of the [Access] Agreement.\u201d (SAC at \u00a7 129) But the Court does not\nconsider that to be a viable post-December 5, 2016 allegation of breach of contract because: (1)\nthe allegation is too vague and conditional (i.e., \u201c[t]o the extent . . .\u201d); (2) it is accompanied by\nno indication of the portion of the Access Agreement that has allegedly been breached; and (3) in\ntheir briefing, Plaintiffs do not cite to this paragraph as evidence of why their breach of contract\nallegations post-date December 5, 2016.\n\n9 See Bohus v. Beloff, 950 F.2d 919, 924 (3d Cir. 1991) (\u201c[S]tate tolling principles\n\nare generally to be used by a federal court when it is applying a state limitations period.\u201d\u2019)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n14\ndiscovery of facts constituting the basis of the cause of action or the existence of facts sufficient\nto put a person of ordinary intelligence and prudence on inquiry which, if pursued, would lead to\nthe discovery of such facts.\u201d Coleman v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, 854 A.2d 838, 842\n(Del. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, \u201cno theory\nwill toll the statute beyond the point where plaintiff was objectively aware, or should have been\naware, of facts giving rise to the wrong.\u201d In re Tyson Foods, 919 A.2d at 585.!\u00b0\n\nOf the three tolling doctrines described above, Plaintiffs allege that they have pleaded\nsufficient facts to demonstrate the applicability of two of them: fraudulent concealment and\nequitable tolling. (D.I. 108 at 16) The Court need only address the first of these.\n\n\u201cUnder Delaware law, fraudulent concealment tolls a statute of limitations where a\ndefendant has done some affirmative act or acts involving \u2018actual artifice\u2019 which prevents a\nplaintiff from discovering the facts giving rise to his or her cause of action, \u2018or [where a\ndefendant has made] some misrepresentation which is intended to put the plaintiff off the trail of\n\n299\n\ninquiry.\u201d\u201d Capricorn Pharma, Inc. v. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., Civil Action No. 08-873-JJF,\n2009 WL 2567022, at *4 (D. Del. Aug. 19, 2009) (quoting Halpern v. Barran, 313 A.2d 139,\n\n143 (Del. Ch. 1973)). Therefore, to assert fraudulent concealment, Plaintiffs must allege that the\n\n10 As was noted above, a plaintiff has no obligation to plead facts in its complaint\n\nthat negate the existence of an affirmative defense. However, sometimes (as here) a complaint\nincludes allegations that, on their face, indicate that a claim accrued outside of the relevant\nstatute of limitations window. In that circumstance, our Court (relying on Delaware state law for\nthis proposition) has held that the plaintiff bears the burden of pleading facts to support the\napplicability of a tolling doctrine. See DuBose, 2021 WL 3145206, at *4; Marshal T. Simpson\nTr. v. Invicta Networks, Inc., Civil Action No. 16-173, 2017 WL 4684325, at *7 (D. Del.

Because Plaintiffs do not dispute that they\nbear this burden, (D.I. 108 at 16 (\u201cOcimum has pled bases to toll the limitations period\u2019)\n(emphasis omitted)), the Court will assume herein that this statement of the law is correct.\n\n15\nLG Chem \u201chad actual knowledge of the wrong done and acted affirmatively in concealing the\nfacts\u201d from the plaintiff. Ewing v. Beck, 520 A.2d 653, 667 (Del. 1987).\"!\n\nIn asserting that they have sufficiently pleaded fraudulent concealment with\nparticularity, '* Plaintiffs point specifically to their allegations in paragraphs 26-46 of the SAC;\nthese allegations describe LG Chem\u2019s actions after the Access Agreement was terminated. (D.I.\n108 at 16-17)\n\nAmongst these allegations are the following:\n\ne After Plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor Gene Logic sent a termination\nletter regarding the Access Agreement to LG Chem in\nDecember 2002, on January 15, 2003, representatives from the\ntwo companies met. During this meeting, which Dr. Koh\nattended on behalf of LG Chem, \u201cLG Chem provided repeated\n\nassurances, through its statements and conduct, to Gene Logic\nthat LG Chem had complied with its contractual termination\n\nqu \u201cIn addition to affirmative acts of misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment can\n\ninvolve the failure to disclose facts when there is [a] duty to disclose.\u201d Capricorn Pharma, Inc.,\n2009 WL 2567022, at *4 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Fraudulent\nconcealment can occur via a failure of disclosure only in limited circumstances, however,\nnamely when one party is in a fiduciary relationship with another. See Litman v. Prudential-\nBache Props., Inc., Civ. A. No. 12137, 1994 WL 30529, at *4 (Del. Ch. Jan. 14, 1994); Lecates\nv. Hertrich Pontiac Buick Co., 515 A.2d 163, 177 (Del. Super. Ct. 1986); see also In re Fruehauf\nTrailer Corp., 250 B.R. 168, 186 (D. Del. 2000) (\u2018\u201c[F]raudulent concealment may be established\nabsent any affirmative act, by alleging a business fiduciary relationship between Defendants and\nPlaintiffs and a duty to disclose.\u201d). Plaintiffs do not allege that LG Chem had a fiduciary duty\nwith regard to them or Gene Logic. However, Plaintiffs do assert that LG Chem had a\ncontractual duty to notify them of the documents underlying this tolling defense, which Plaintiffs\nargue is sufficient under Delaware law to provide for the alternative path to demonstrating\nfraudulent concealment. (D.I. 108 at 17) LG Chem disagrees with Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of\nthe law in this regard. (D.I. 116 at 7)\n\nThe Court need not resolve this issue. Because the Court has concluded herein that\nPlaintiffs have plausibly asserted the applicability of the fraudulent concealment tolling doctrine\nby reference to affirmative acts, it need not look further for other ways as to which that doctrine\nmight apply.\n\n2 Facts relating to an allegation that a statute of limitations is tolled due to\nfraudulent concealment must be pleaded with particularity, pursuant to Rule 9(b).

In fact, at all times when it made these untrue\nrepresentations and deceiving actions, LG Chem knew that (1)\nGene Logic was seeking assurance that the Access Agreement\nwas being followed, including termination protocols, and (11)\nGene Logic was relying on the written and verbal\nrepresentations of LG Chem to refrain from enforcing its rights\nunder the Access Agreement, which obligations expressly\nsurvived termination.\u201d (/d. at \u00a7 30)\n\ne \u201cLG Chem, including its employee, Dr. Koh, engaged in an\naffirmative act of concealment by affirming through its conduct\nand actions that LG Chem had erased or returned all copies of\nthe Oncology Datasuite. In fact, LG Chem secretly kept a copy\nof the Oncology Datasuite, which LG Chem continued to use\nlong after the Access Agreement expired without paying the\nrequired access fee to Gene Logic.\u201d (dd. at \u00a7 31)\n\ne \u201cLG Chem furthered its active concealment by actually\nreturning hard disks containing the Oncology Datasuite to\nGene Logic,[] as requested by Gene Logic, which was an act\nsolely intended to mislead Gene Logic, and make Gene Logic\nbelieve it had received everything in LG Chem\u2019s possession\u201d\nwhen in fact that was not true. (/d. at \u00a7] 32; see also id. at [4\n33-36)\n\ne LG Chem also returned a Sun Microsystems E450 server that\nhad been provided by Gene Logic and that contained an entire\ncopy of the Oncology Datasuite, and LG Chem affirmed that it\nhad destroyed or erased all of Gene Logic\u2019s data that had been\ncreated or transferred to the location at which the server had\nbeen housed. These acts were also intended to induce Gene\nLogic into believing that the termination process had been\nsuccessfully completed, when in fact, it had not. (/d. at {| 23,\n38, 42)\n\nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that these facts plausibly establish the applicability of the\nfraudulent concealment tolling doctrine. They amount to specifically-alleged, affirmative acts by\n\nLG Chem\u2014acts that falsely assured Plaintiffs that LG Chem no longer had any version of the\nOncology Datasuite (and thus could no longer use that product). This, in turn, is said to have\nlulled Plaintiffs into a false sense of security\u2014i.e., Plaintiffs were not aware of or on the lookout\nfor contractual breaches by LG Chem in the future, because they believed (wrongfully, thanks to\nLG Chem\u2019s actions and misrepresentations) that no such breaches could possibly occur.\n\nIn arguing against this conclusion, LG Chem notes that the events listed above are said to\nhave happened in and around January 2003, and that Plaintiffs have not otherwise \u201cshow[n] that\nLG Chem took any affirmative actions to prevent or dissuade Plaintiffs from discovering the\nmultiple publications that issued in 2007 and continuing for years after.\u201d (D.I. 116 at 7\n(emphasis in original); see also id. at 8) But the Court does not see why this fact is dispositive\nhere. If LG Chem made affirmative misrepresentations in 2003 that effectively fooled Plaintiffs\ninto thinking that LG Chem had complied with the Access Agreement and would no longer have\nthe ability to utilize the Oncology Datasuite, then it stands to reason that the effect of those\nrepresentations could\u2014unless other events intervened\u2014last quite a long time. Put differently,\nonce Plaintiffs were misled by the alleged fraud, it seems plausible that they might well have\nremained misled for years.\n\nNow, to be sure, the Court still must assess whether the pleaded facts otherwise indicate\nthat, at some point between 2003 and 2017 (the year when Plaintiffs allege that they became\naware of the publication of the 2007 Article, the 2012 LG Life Sciences Application, the 2014\nArticle and the '279 Foundation Application, each of which contained content that then alerted\n\nPlaintiffs to LG Chem\u2019s breaches of contract)'? Plaintiffs, \u201cexercising reasonable diligence,\n\nB (See SAC at J\u00a7 86-87, 89-90, 96-99, 105, 116-19) The Court notes that it would\nhave been better had Plaintiffs pleaded some additional facts regarding how, exactly, they\nbecame aware of the four publications in 2017. But LG Chem does not point to that lack of\ndetail as a reason to grant its motion to dismiss. And so the Court does not address it further\nhere.\n\n18\nshould have discovered the alleged injury.\u201d Gen. Video Corp. v. Kertesz, No. 1922-VCL, 2008\nWL 509816, at *5 (Del. Ch. Feb. 25, 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If\nPlaintiffs should have done so at some point prior to 2017, then any tolling of the statute of\nlimitations would cease at that point. \u201cInquiry notice does not require a plaintiff to have actual\nknowledge of a wrong, but simply an objective awareness of the facts giving rise to the wrong.\u201d\nLion 2004 Receivables Tr. v.

Aug. 31, 2017).\nAccordingly, \u201c[iJn examining whether the plaintiff was on inquiry notice, the court determines\nwhether there were any red flags that clearly and unmistakably would have led a prudent person\nof ordinary intelligence to inquire and if pursued, would have led to discovery of the elements of\nthe claim being asserted.\u201d Jd.

Lion 2004\nReceivables Tr., 2017 WL 1053100, at *6 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nObviously, if a prudent person of ordinary intelligence in Plaintiffs\u2019 shoes should have\ngotten wind of the publication of the 2007 Article, the 2012 LG Life Sciences Application, the\n\n2014 Article and/or the '279 Foundation Application (hereafter, the \u201cfour publications\u201d)'* in or\n\n4 The Court focuses herein on these four publications, in light of their significance\n\nin the SAC. LG Chem also notes that there were other related U.S. and foreign patent\napplications or patents (some of which are also referenced in the SAC) that contain similar\nreferences to Gene Logic or to the Oncology Datasuite. (D.I. 102 at 2 & nn. 2-3; D.I. 116 at 1)\nAlthough the Court will largely refer to the four publications herein, the logic of the Court\u2019s\ndecision would not change were the existence of some or all of these other patent\napplications/patents taken into account.\n\n19\naround the time those articles/applications were published, then Plaintiffs\u2019 case for tolling would\nfall away.'> But Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to explain why they did not know about\nthese documents\u2014and why they should not have reasonably known about them\u2014at or around\nthe documents\u2019 respective publication dates. Among those facts are that:\ne LG Chem was just one of over 100 customers of Gene\nLogic/Plaintiffs, and during the relevant years, Gene\nLogic/Plaintiffs had no reason to believe that LG Chem was\nengaged in wrongdoing.\ne Plaintiffs did not have any other interactions with LG Chem\n\nbetween 2003 and 2017 that might have prompted them to\ninquire about these issues.; and\n\ne The four publications were just a few of millions of articles\n\npublished or applications filed worldwide in those years, and\n\nPlaintiffs would not have had sufficient reason to search for\n\nthose particular articles/applications amongst millions of\n\nothers.\n(See, e.g., SAC at Jf 87-89, 92, 97-98, 101, 106, 115-18) These allegations bolster Plaintiffs\u2019\nposition. They help to demonstrate why LG Chem\u2014just one of a large number of former\ncustomers of Gene Logic/Plaintiffs, and one who did not reinsert itself into Gene Logic\u2019s or\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 business dealings in the interval\u2014would not necessarily have been on Plaintiffs\u2019 radar\n\nscreen during these intervening years. And they provide additional context as to why, during this\n\n1s It appears to be disputed as to whether any of these four publications were\n\npublicly available (e.g., via the Internet) in or around the time of their alleged filing/publication.\n(D.I. 102 at 17-18; D.I. 108 at 10-11; D.I. 116 at 5 n.5) Even assuming, however, that at least\nthe patent applications (or the patents later resulting from them) were publicly available in this\nmanner outside the limitations period, (D.I. 102 at 17-18; D.I. 116 at 5 n.5), there is no per se\ntule stating that simply because a patent application was publicly filed, that means that a\nreasonable person in Plaintiffs\u2019 shoes necessarily should have been on notice of the filing.

Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., Civil Action No. 08-873-JJF, 2009 WL 2567022 (D.\nDel. Aug. 19, 2009). (D.I. 108 at 11, 16-17; D.I. 116 at 8-9) In Capricorn, inter alia, the\nplaintiff brought breach of contract and trade secret misappropriation claims under Delaware law\nagainst the defendants, and the defendants moved to dismiss those claims on the ground that they\nwere time-barred under the applicable three-year statute of limitations. 2009 WL 2567022, at\n*1-2. Ultimately, the Capricorn Court concluded that the plaintiff had adequately pleaded the\napplicability of the fraudulent concealment doctrine, sufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss\non statute of limitations grounds.\n\nThe facts in Capricorn are not on all fours with the facts here, and so in some ways, the\ncase is not a great comparator. For example, in Capricorn, the alleged period of time between\nwhen fraudulent concealment began and when the plaintiff became aware of the alleged\nmisconduct was about five years (from 2003 to 2008), whereas here, that period of time is far\nlonger. Jd. at *2. And while here, LG Chem\u2019s alleged fraudulent acts of concealment occurred\nat the beginning of the tolling period in 2003, in Capricorn, there were a number of different acts\nof concealment that occurred throughout the five-year period in question. /d. at *2, *6; see also\n(D.I. 116 at 8-9).\n\nBut in some ways, Capricorn is helpful to Plaintiffs. For example, one of the facts that\nthe Capricorn Court relied on was that during the tolled period in question, a defendant provided\n\u201caffirmative assurances to\u201d the plaintiff that it was abiding by its contractual responsibilities,\nwhen in fact this was allegedly false. 2009 WL 2567022, at *6 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). Similarly, here, Plaintiffs allege that LG Chem provided repeated false\nassurances in 2003 to Gene Logic that LG Chem had complied with its contractual termination\nobligations and had returned or destroyed all copies of the Oncology Datasuite. (SAC at {fj 29-\n31; D.I. 108 at 16-17) Moreover, in Capricorn (like here), the defendants had asserted that\nbecause a patent application had been filed in 2004 that contained the trade secrets at issue, this\nshould serve to extinguish the tolling period. 2009 WL 2567022, at *4. Yet the Capricorn Court\ndisagreed, noting that there was no per se rule in that regard, and that ultimately, in light of the\nrelevant record, a reasonable person in the plaintiff's shoes would not necessarily have been\naware of the filing of that patent application. /d. at *4-7.

Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc., Civil Action No. 10-487-RGA-CJB, 2015 WL 5470210 (D. Del.\nAug. 6, 2015). (D.I. 108 at 11-12; D.I. 116 at 9) The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the facts\nin Lambda are not similar to the facts here (for additional reasons beyond the reality that, unlike\nhere, Lambda was decided at the summary judgment stage). And it thus concludes that the\noutcome in Lambda supports Plaintiffs\u2019 position, not LG Chem\u2019s position. (D.I. 108 at 11-12)\n\nIn Lambda, at issue was a New Jersey state law claim for trade secret misappropriation;\nas here, the New Jersey claim accrued when the misappropriation was discovered, or by exercise\nof reasonable diligence should have been discovered. 2015 WL 5470210, at *8. In Lambda, a\npatent containing the alleged trade secrets was published by the predecessor (\u201cPrinceton\u201d) of a\ncounterclaim defendant (\u201cLOS\u201d) in December 2005, and the claim was not filed by the\ncounterclaim plaintiff (\u201cAlcatel\u201d) until January 201 1\u2014 such that if the patent\u2019s publication\nshould have reasonably put Alcatel on notice of its claim, then that claim would be time-barred.\nId. at *2, *9. The Court ultimately agreed with the counterclaim defendants\u2019 argument that\nAlcatel should have, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, discovered the alleged trade\nsecret by the date that the patent was published. Jd. at *9.\n\nBut crucially, the Court did so based on the presence of a number of factors that are not at\nplay here. For one thing, there were many facts of record indicating that Alcatel should have\nbeen particularly attuned to patent filings by Princeton at the time of the filing-at-issue: (1)\nPrinceton was Alcatel\u2019s competitor and it was located \u201cdown the street\u201d from Alcatel; (2) prior\nto the filing date, Alcatel was so concerned by Princeton\u2019s conduct regarding possible\nmisappropriation that it wrote a letter to Princeton requesting \u201cassurances\u201d; and (3) prior to the\nfiling date, Princeton publicly announced that it had been awarded a $29 million contract by a\ncustomer whom Alcatel had been targeting. /d. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nNothing anywhere near approaching these facts (in terms of Plaintiffs\u2019 connection with LG\nChem at the relevant times of the filing of the four publications) is a part of the record in this\ncase. Moreover, while Alcatel had raised a fraudulent concealment-related tolling argument, it\nhad done so in one conclusory sentence in its brief; the summary judgment record showed why\nthat \u201cbare-bones\u201d argument was unavailing. /d. at *9-10. Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent\nconcealment arguments are more well-developed, and we do not yet have a full summary\njudgment record on which to assess them.\n\n24\nFor the above-stated reasons, the Court recommends that LG Chem\u2019s motion to dismiss\nbe DENIED as to Count II.\n\nii. A&GC\n\nA&GC makes two separate arguments as to why the claim against them in Count II\nshould be dismissed on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds: (1) because the claim is time-barred, (D.I. 97 at\n7-9); and (2) because Plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts to state a plausible claim, (id. at 9-\n15). The Court need only address the latter argument to conclude that the claim should be\ndismissed as to A&GC.\n\nPursuant to Delaware law, there are four elements to a claim for misappropriation of\ntrade secrets: (i) a trade secret exists;\u201d\u00b0 (ii) the trade secret was communicated to the defendant;\n(iti) the communication was made pursuant to an express or implied understanding that the\nsecrecy of the information would be maintained; and (iv) the trade secret has been\nmisappropriated within the meaning of that term as defined in DUTSA.

[dJerives\nindependent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not\nbeing readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value\nfrom its disclosure or use [and i]s the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the\ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4). A&GC states in their\nbriefing that they \u201cdo not concede that\u201d the GeneExpress Product, including the Oncology\nDatasuite and Gene Logic Software, and data contained therein, in fact constitute trade secrets.\n(D.I. 97 at 10 n.10) But A&GC do not substantively contest this fact either in the briefing. And\nso for purposes of resolving A&GC\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true that (as stated\nin the SAC) these are in fact trade secrets. (SAC at {J 49-52)\n\n21 The Court reviews these allegations under the typical Twombly/Iqbal pleading\nstandard associated with Rule 8, as there are no allegations of misrepresentation or deception as\n\n25\nWith regard to the fourth element (i.e., that a trade secret has been misappropriated),\nwhich is at issue here, the claimant must plead facts sufficient to plausibly demonstrate\nmisappropriation by the defendant.

May 22, 2020).\n\n26\nA&GC argues that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead misappropriation. So a good\nplace to start in analyzing this issue is: How does the SAC allege that A&GC actually\nmisappropriated Plaintiffs\u2019 trade secrets?\n\nHere, an initial problem is that Count II itself makes it hard to figure this out. Most of the\ncount involves conclusory statements that \u201cDefendants\u201d (that is LG Chem and A&GC, lumped\ntogether) have unlawfully used or disclosed the trade secrets at issue, without specifying who is\nalleged to have done what when.\n\nBut in looking back to the \u201cFactual Background\u201d section of the SAC, the pleading\nidentifies A&GC as having some contact with the alleged trade secrets in a few different ways:\n\ne In January 2019, the '206 application was published in\nA&GC\u2019s name, and the application made reference, inter alia,\nto the inventors\u2019 use of \u201cmicroarray gene expression data\nobtained from the Gene Express Oncology Datasuite[] of Gene\nLogic Inc.\u201d in the process of formulating their invention.\ne A&GC was assigned the '561 patent and the '660 patent; in the\ntext of those patents, there are references to Plaintiffs\u2019\nmicroarray data that, it is alleged, was used to develop the\nmethods disclosed and claimed in those patents.\ne A Gencurix product, GenesWell BCT, makes use of certain\nnovel Endogenous Reference Genes (\u201cERGs\u2019\u2019) that were\nallegedly developed via use of Plaintiffs\u2019 trade secrets and are\ndisclosed in the '206 application, the '561 patent and the '660\npatent.\n(SAC at ff 132-33, 147-68, 180) The SAC also states in paragraph 144 (hereafter, \u201cparagraph\n144\u201d) that \u201c[dJuring a telephone conversation on June 2, 2020, Ocimum learned that usage of its\nproprietary oncology database by Abion and Gencurix was facilitated by LG Chem employee Dr.\nKoh.\u201d (dd. at 4 144)\n\nHerein, the Court will assume arguendo that by publishing or obtaining or making use of\n\nthe '206 application, the '561 patent and the '660 patent (documents that, in turn, describe how\n\n27\nthe inventors relied on and made use of the alleged trade secrets), or, in Gencurix\u2019s case, by\nmaking use of certain ERGs (which, in turn, were developed via use of the alleged trade secrets)\nto formulate GenesWell BCT, then A&GC was \u201cusing\u201d the alleged trade secrets under the\nmeaning of the law.\u201d? Cf Oakwood Labs. LLC v. Thanoo, 999 F.3d 892, 908-09 (3d Cir. 2021)\n(containing an expansive definition of \u201cuse\u201d of trade secrets in this context). Nevertheless, for\nthe reasons set out below, the Court concludes that the SAC does not sufficiently allege how\nA&GC used the alleged trade secrets while knowing, or having reason to know, that the they\nwere derived from or through a party (e.g., LG Chem or others) who utilized \u201cimproper means\u201d\nto acquire them, or that there was a duty to maintain the trade secrets\u2019 secrecy or limit their use\n(hereafter, that the trade secret was \u201cobtained through improper means\u201d).\n\nFor example, Plaintiffs argue that A&GC should have known that material from the\nGeneExpress Product/database was obtained through improper means because: (1) A&GC\n\nshould have known that LG Chem had an ongoing contractual duty to protect that material from\n\n22 In their opening brief, A&GC asserted, without citation, that the \u201cfact that the\nspecification [of the above-mentioned three patent publications] references Plaintiffs\u2019 database is\ninsufficient to allege use by A&GC.\u201d (D.I. 97 at 14) But by the time of their reply brief, A&GC\ndid not seem to still be hotly contesting that wrongful \u201cuse\u201d was plausibly alleged; instead, there,\nthey focused on other reasons why the claims should be dismissed. (D.I. 117 at 1-3)\n\n23 However, it is not clear to the Court that the SAC sufficiently alleges that A&GC\n\u201cacquired\u201d the Oncology Datasuite\u2014in the sense of physically taking possession of the product.\nIn their briefing, A&GC deny that they ever did so (though in support they cite repeatedly to\nmaterials outside the pleadings, which the Court cannot consider here). (See D.I. 97 at 11-12;\nD.I. 117 at 3) The closest allegation in the SAC that might suggest this is in paragraph 144, and\neven there, the SAC only cryptically states that during a phone conversation, Plaintiffs \u201clearned\nthat usage of its proprietary oncology database by [A&GC] was facilitated\u201d by Dr. Koh. (SAC at\n4] 144) The pleading never clearly states that this \u201cusage\u201d is said to have amounted to A&GC\ntaking physical possession of the database. Nor does the SAC otherwise describe how it is that\nsuch physical possession was accomplished. Indeed, at times in their briefing, Plaintiffs hint that\nthe SAC may not actually mean to allege that this type of \u201cacquisition\u201d of the trade secrets took\nplace. (D.I. 107 at 11-12)\n\n28\ndisclosure; and (2) A&GC should have, but did not, conduct an inquiry to determine what right\nLG Chem (or any other downstream users of this data) had to use Plaintiffs\u2019 technology. (D.I.\n107 at 10) The SAC certainly does make the bald assertion that A&GC \u201cknew or should have\nknown that the inventors of [the '206 application, the '561 patent and the '660 patent] did not\nhave a license and were not otherwise authorized to use Ocimum\u2019s trade secrets\u201d and that\n\u201cTb]ased on the information available to them when they were \u2018assigned\u2019 Ocimum\u2019s trade\nsecrets, Abion and Gencurix were in possession of information that should have put them on\nnotice of trade secret misappropriation.\u201d (SAC at {] 177, 183) But in the SAC, Plaintiffs never\nplead facts explain why these bald assertions are correct.\n\nNor is that clear to the Court. LG Chem is the entity that is alleged to have originally\nmade wrongful use of the trade secrets. Yet the SAC never really articulates why the nature of\nA&GC\u2019s connection to LG Chem should have tipped A&GC off about a duty of secrecy. After\nall, A&GC were assigned the '206 application, the '561 patent and the '660 patent in 2018 and\nthereafter\u2014nearly two decades after Gene Logic terminated the Access Agreement with LG\nChem. (SAC at \u00a7J 132, 156, 180) And A&GC did not acquire this intellectual property directly\nfrom LG Chem. (/d. at J 180) In fact, the only direct connection between A&GC and LG Chem\nis what is alleged in paragraph 144, where it is vaguely asserted that LG Chem employee Dr.\nKoh \u201cfacilitated\u201d A&GC\u2019s use of Plaintiffs\u2019 database. (/d. at 144) But even there, no\nallegation is made as to when that \u201cfacilitat[ion]\u201d occurred, or how A&GC knew or should have\nknown, at the time of that facilitation, that information from the database had to be kept secret.\n\nPlaintiffs also make mention of how the '206 application makes direct reference to the\ninventors\u2019 use of \u201cGene Express Oncology Datasuite[] of Gene Logic Inc.\u201d (/d. at {9 133, 147-\n\n49) And yet the SAC never explains why this reference alone should have caused A&GC to\n\n29\nlearn that there had been a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy regarding that material. Nor do\nPlaintiffs cite to case law suggesting that in such circumstances, A&GC had a duty to investigate\nthe original source of the material or to probe whether the material had been properly\nobtained/shared by that source or by others thereafter who came into contact with it. (D.I. 117 at\n3-4)24\n\nNow, the SAC does also allege that \u201c[o]n December 5, 2019, Ocimum sent letters to\nAbion, Gencurix, and counsel prosecuting their patents, for an explanation of how they came\ninto possession of the Oncology Datasuite.\u201d (SAC at 4 143; see also D.I. 107 at 11 (Plaintiffs\nasserting that \u201c[t]his letter provided actual notice of Ocimum\u2019s claims\u201d))\u201d> Plaintiffs have\nattached a copy of that letter (hereafter, the \u201cDecember 5, 2019 letter\u201d) to their briefing. (D.I.\n107, ex. 6)? And the Court agrees that, giving Plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable inferences,\n\nthe December 5, 2019 letter could plausibly have put A&GC on notice that any future unlicensed\n\na4 Plaintiffs also cite to federal caselaw for the proposition that A&GC could be\n\nliable for trade secret misappropriation if they were willfully blind to the reality that the trade\nsecrets at issue were acquired through improper means or should be subject to secrecy/limited\nuse. (D.I. 107 at 10-11 & n.2 (citing Computer Assocs. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693, 718-19 (2nd\nCir. 1992); Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. HQ Specialty Pharma Corp., 157 F.Supp.3d 407, 426\n(D.N.J. 2016)). As a general matter, willful blindness has two components: (1) the defendant\nmust subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists; and (2) the defendant\nmust take deliberate action to avoid learning of this fact. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.\nSEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754, 769 (2011).\n\nFor the same reasons as set out herein, there are simply not sufficiently plausible\nallegations that A&GC was willfully blind to circumstances indicating that that the trade secrets\nat issue were acquired through improper means, or that they should have remained subject to\nsecrecy or limited use.\n\n25 Of note, the December 5, 2019 letter was sent on the very day that Plaintiffs filed\nthis lawsuit. (D.I. 1)\n\n26 The Court can properly consider the letter\u2019s content here, since the letter is a\n\ndocument integral to the SAC.\n\n30\nuse of information drawn from the Oncology Datasuite would be a breach of secrecy that was\nviolative of the law. (fd. (December 5, 2019 letter asserting that A&GC \u201cmay be in possession\nof an unauthorized copy of Ocimum\u2019s Oncology Datasuite\u201d and that \u201cOcimum has searched its\nrecords and cannot find any license agreements granting your companies access to this\nproprietary database . . . [nJor are we aware of any current or former licensee that was given\npermission to provide this proprietary database to either of your companies\u201d\u2019))\n\nHowever, from there, the SAC does ot sufficiently explain what post-December 5, 2019\nactions either Abion or Gencurix took, after gaining this knowledge, that would amount to trade\nsecret misappropriation. While the SAC does describe how Gencurix has developed the\nGenesWell BCT product, (id. at {J 157-85), and alleges that Gencurix \u201ccommenced using\nGenesWell BCT in commerce in the United States in 2017,\u201d (id. at | 169), the SAC makes no\nspecific allegations as to what actions Gencurix took regarding that product (if any) after\nDecember 5, 2019, (id. at \u00a7] 157-85). Instead, these portions of the SAC are largely ambiguous\nas to what Gencurix did when regarding this product.?\u2019\n\nFor the above stated reasons, the Court recommends that A&GC\u2019s motion to dismiss be\n\nGRANTED as to Count II.\n\nc. Count III (Misappropriation of Trade Secrets Under the\nDUTSA)\n\nIn Count III, Plaintiffs assert trade secret misappropriation under the DTSA against all\nthree Defendants. Again, the Court will first address LG Chem\u2019s arguments for dismissal of this\n\ncount, and then will take up A&GC\u2019s arguments.\n\n27 In their briefing, Plaintiffs also suggest that A&GC may have taken post-\n\nDecember 5, 2019 acts that constitute misappropriation by \u201ccontinu[ing] to prosecute and\ncommercialize the offending patents.\u201d (D.I. 107 at 11; see also SAC at \u00a7 15) But nowhere in the\nSAC do Plaintiffs plead any facts regarding any particular post-December 5, 2019 prosecution-\nrelated conduct taken by A&GC that can be said to amount to trade secret misappropriation.\n\n31\ni. LG Chem\n\nSimilar to the DUTSA, with regard to the DTSA: (1) a claim must be brought within\nthree years after the date on which the misappropriation is discovered, or by the exercise of\nreasonable diligence should have been discovered; and (2) a continuing violation constitutes a\nsingle claim of misappropriation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836(d).\n\nLG Chem\u2019s first argument for dismissal of Count III is that the claim should be dismissed\nbecause it is time-barred. Its argument here is identical to its argument for dismissal as to Count\nIl; as there, the Court recommends that LG Chem\u2019s motion be DENIED on this ground.\n\nBut LG Chem has a second argument for dismissal of Count II]: that the DTSA does not\napply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim, because the claim pre-dates the statute\u2019s enactment. (D.I. 102 at 10)\nMore specifically, LG Chem argues that: (1) a DTSA claim cannot be supported by a cause of\naction that arose prior to the statute\u2019s enactment on May 11, 2016, see Cave Consulting Grp. v.\nTruven Health Analytics, Inc., Case No. 15-cv-02177-SI, 2017 WL 1436044, at *3 (N.D. Cal.\nApr. 24, 2017) (noting that the DTSA only covers acts occurring \u201con or after the [May 11, 2016]\ndate of the enactment of the Act\u2019) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Avago Techs.\nU.S. Inc. v. nanoPrecision Prods., Inc., Case No. 16-cv-03737-JCS, 2017 WL 412524, at *8\n(N.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2017) (same); and (2) the claim against it in Count III is such a cause of\naction, in that \u201c[a]ll of the articles at issue date before May 11, 2016, and each of the patent\napplications and patents at issue trace back before the DTSA enactment as well.\u201d (D.I. 102 at\n10) In the Court\u2019s view, LG Chem is correct that Count III should be dismissed as to it.\n\nIn response to LG Chem\u2019s argument, Plaintiffs take two tacks, both of which are\nunsuccessful. First, Plaintiffs cite to 10 paragraphs of the SAC, which each, in some form or\n\nanother, assert vaguely that LG Chem\u2019s trade secret misappropriation may have continued to the\n\n32\npresent day. (D.I. 108 at 10 (citing SAC at 4\u00a7 10, 31, 124-25, 129, 190-91, 193, 201, 205)) But\nhere, the Court agrees with LG Chem that these paragraphs simply amount to \u201cbare legal\nconclusions regarding post-2016 conduct\u201d that include \u201cno factual support.\u201d (D.I. 116 at 3); see\nalso Morse, 132 F.3d at 906 (noting that a court need not credit \u201c\u201ca complaint\u2019s bald assertions or\nlegal conclusions\u201d when deciding a motion to dismiss) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)). In not one of these paragraphs do Plaintiffs provide any specific factual allegation of\nexactly what post-May 11, 2016 acts LG Chem is said to have taken to misuse Plaintiffs alleged\ntrade secrets. (SAC at \u00a7f 10, 31, 124-25, 129, 190-91, 193, 201, 205) LG Chem is left to guess\nas to what it is being alleged to have done when, and that type of uncertainty is not countenanced\nby Rule 8 or federal pleading requirements. Second, Plaintiffs again claim that LG Chem \u201c\u2018sold\u2019\nOcimum trade secrets to A&GC in June 2018.\u201d (D.I. 108 at 10) But as the Court previously\nnoted, see supra p. 12, there is no factual support in the SAC for that premise.\n\nFor these reasons, the Court recommends that LG Chem\u2019s motion to dismiss be\nGRANTED as to Count III.\n\nii. A&GC\n\nAs to A&GC, with regard to Count III, the parties\u2019 arguments for or against dismissal of\nthis DTSA claim were identical to those they made regarding Count II\u2019s DUTSA claim (in light\nof the similarity of the two statutes). (D.I. 97 at 9-15; D.I. 107 at 10-17; D.I. 117 at 1-6) For the\nsame reasons as provided above with regard to Count II, the Court recommends that A&GC\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss should be GRANTED as to Count III.?8\n\n28 The Court thus need not address A&GC\u2019s alternative argument that Count III\n\nshould be dismissed as to them because the DTSA does not apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. (D.I. 97\nat 15)\n\n33\nB. A&GC\u2019s Argument for Dismissal Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2)\n\nA&GC also alternatively argues for dismissal of Counts II and III due to lack of personal\njurisdiction, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2). (D.I. 97 at 15)\n\nPlaintiffs assert that personal jurisdiction exists as to A&GC pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure Rule 4(k)(2).7? (SAC at 49) Rule 4(k)(2), which serves as a federal long-arm\nstatute, allows a court to exert jurisdiction over a foreign defendant where the defendant lacks\nsufficient contacts in a single state to bring it within the reach of the state\u2019s long-arm statute, yet\nhas enough contacts with the United States as a whole to make jurisdiction constitutional. Saudi\nv. Acomarit Maritimes Servs., S.A., 114 F. App\u2019x 449, 455 (3d Cir. 2004). Rule 4(k)(2) allows a\ncourt to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if: (1) the plaintiff's claim arises under\nfederal law, (2) the defendant is beyond the jurisdictional reach of any state court of general\njurisdiction; and (3) the defendant has sufficient contacts with the United States such that the\ncourt\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with the due process requirements of the\n\nConstitution or other federal law. Saudi, 114 F. App\u2019x at 455.\u00b0\u00b0\n\n29 Rule 4(k)(2) reads as follows: \u201cFor a claim that arises under federal law, serving\n\na summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant if:\n(A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state\u2019s courts of general jurisdiction; and\n(B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United States Constitution and laws.\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 4(k)(2).\n30 When a defendant moves to dismiss a lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction, the\nplaintiff bears the burden of showing the basis for jurisdiction. Power Integrations, Inc. v. BCD\nSemiconductor Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 365, 369 (D. Del. 2008). In a case like this one, where a\ndistrict court has not held an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff must only make a prima\nfacie showing that personal jurisdiction exists. See Perlight Solar Co., Ltd. v. Perlight Sales N.\nAm. LL, C.A. No. 14-331-LPS, 2015 WL 5544966, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 18, 2015). All factual\ninferences to be drawn from the pleadings, affidavits and exhibits must be drawn in the plaintiff's\nfavor at this stage. Power Integrations, 547 F. Supp. 2d at 369.\n\n34\nHere, with regard to the first factor of the Rule 4(k)(2) analysis, the only federal claim\npleaded against A&GC is in Count III, wherein Plaintiffs alleged a violation of the DTSA. Yet\nabove, the Court has concluded that the SAC does not successfully plead a claim for a violation\nof that statute. Since the SAC does not contain a well-pleaded claim under federal law against\nthese Defendants, there is not personal jurisdiction over A&GC. See Rivet v. Regions Bank of\nLa., 522 U.S. 470, 475 (1998) (noting that \u201c\u2018[t]he presence or absence of federal-question\njurisdiction is governed by the well-pleaded complaint rule, which provides that federal\njurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly\npleaded complaint.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); Touchcom, Inc. v. Bereskin & Parr, 574 F.3d 1403,\n1413 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (noting that claims arise under federal law for purposes of Rule 4(k)(2)\nonly when a \u201cwell-pleaded complaint establishes\u201d that the claims invoke a federal legal right)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nFor this reason, the Court recommends that A&GC\u2019s motion to dismiss also be\nGRANTED on the ground that there is no personal jurisdiction over them.*!\n\nCc. A&GC\u2019s Motion to Strike\n\nLastly, A&GC moves to strike the above-referenced allegation in paragraph 144 of the\nSAC, on the ground that it amounts to wrongful use of a communication made pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 408. (D.I. 97 at 19-20) Above, the Court has explained why, even\n\n31 Were Plaintiffs to have pleaded facts that clearly and understandably set out how\n\nthese Defendants committed a post-December 5, 2019 act of trade secret misappropriation, either\nby \u201cusing\u201d the trade secrets at issue in some way as to prosecution or assertion of the '206\napplication, the '561 patent and/or the '660 patent, or by doing so via Gencurix\u2019s development or\nmarketing of GenesWell BCT in the United States, then it might be that Rule 4(k)(2) jurisdiction\nwould exist. Cf Touchcom, Inc., 574 F.3d at 1416; Lismont v. Alexander Binzel Corp., Civil\nAction No. 2:12cv592, 2013 WL 6095461, at *7 (E.D. Va. Nov. 18, 2013); see also Oakwood\nLabs. LLC, 999 F.3d at 909. But that type of analysis would need to proceed only when a\npleading actually sets out the existence of such relevant acts.\n\n35\nwere it to consider that allegation, Counts II and III should still be dismissed. In light of that, the\nCourt orders that A&GC\u2019s motion to strike be DENIED as MOOT.\nII. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that the LG Chem motion to dismiss be\nGRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART, in that Counts I and II against LG Chem should\nsurvive dismissal, but Count ITI should be dismissed. It recommends that the A&GC motion to\ndismiss be GRANTED as to both Counts II and III against them.*\u201d And it orders that A&GC\u2019s\nmotion to strike be DENIED as MOOT.\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.

The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).
