Stark", "date": "03-31-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nTONAL SYSTEMS , INC., \nV. \nIFIT INC., Declaratory Judgement Plaintiff \nand Defendant , \nDeclaratory Judgement Defendant \nand Plaintiff. C.A. No. 20-1197-LPS-CJB \nCONSOLIDATED \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nWHEREAS , on February 7, 2022, Magistrate Judge Burke issued a seven-page Report \nand Recommendation (\"Report\") (C.A. No. 21-652 D.I. 45), recommending that the Court: \n(1) grant Defendant Tonal Systems, Inc.'s (\"Tonal\") motion to dismiss (C.A. No. 21-652 D.I. 10) \nPlaintiff iFIT Inc.' s (\"iFIT\") \"pre-suit\" 1 induced infringement and willful infringement claims \npled in the first amended complaint (C.A. No. 21-652 D.I. 7), and allow iFIT to file a further \namended complaint (Report ,r,r 5, 6); and (2) deny Tonal's motion to dismiss if iFIT \"intends to \npress 'post-suit' induced infringement and willful infringement claims, dating from on or about \nMay 5, 2021\" (id. ,r 7); \nWHEREAS , on February 22, 2022, Tonal filed \"limited objections \" (\"Objections \" or \n\"Objs.\") (C.A. No. 20-1197 D.I. 60), contending that Judge Burke erred in holding that \n\"allegations of knowledge based solely on the filing of an original complaint suffice[] to state a \n1 Unless otherwise indicated, the terms \"pre-suit\" and \"post-suit\" as used in this Memorandum \nOrder refer, respectively , to the time periods before and after the filing of the original complaint \non May 5, 2021. (See C.A. No. 21-652 D.I. 1) \n1 claim for [post-suit] willful and induced infringement\" pled in the amended complaint (Objs. at \n2); \nWHEREAS, on March 8, 2022, iFIT responded to Tonal's Objections (\"Response\" or \n\"Resp.\") (C.A. No. 20-1197 D.I. 63); \nWHEREAS , iFIT did not object to the Report with respect to its recommendation to \ndismiss the \"pre-suit\" induced infringement and willful infringement claims; \nWHEREAS, the Court has considered the Objections and the Response, and reviewed the \nReport de novo, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(l) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); Brown v. Astrue, 649 F.3d \n193, 195 (3d Cir. 2011); \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: (1) Tonal's Objections (C.A. \nNo. 20-1197 D.I. 60) are OVERRULED ; (2) Judge Burke's Report (C.A. No. 21-652 D.I. 45) is \nADOPTED ; (3) Tonal's motion to dismiss (C.A. No. 21-652 D.I. 10) is GRANTED IN PART \nwith respect to \"pre-suit\" induced and willful infringement claims and is DENIED IN PART \nwith respect to \"post-suit\" induced and willful infringement claims; and (4) by no later than \nApril 21, 2022, iFIT may file an amended complaint to replead \"pre-suit\" induced and willful \ninfringement claims. \n1. The Court disagrees with Tonal' s contention that \"permitting the original \ncomplaint to supply the requisite basis for willfulness and inducement would eliminate any \nmeaningful pleading requirement \" with respect to \"specific intent.\" (Objs. at 3-4) The \"specific \nintent\" in iFIT' s induced and willful infringement claims is supported not only by the filing ( and \nservice) of the original complaint -which provides the factual basis for Tonal's knowledge of \nthe patents-in-suit and the infringement claims (see Report 17)-but also by the alleged facts \nthat Tonal \"has continued to knowingly engage in infringing conduct thereafter \" (id. 12). With \n2 respect to the requisite knowledge , there is \"little practical difference between a pre-complaint \nnotice letter informing a defendant about a patentee's allegation of infringement and a \nsubsequently-superseded original complaint formally alleging infringement. \" Clouding IP, LLC \nv. Amazon.com , Inc., 2013 WL 2293452, at *4 (D. Del. May 24, 2013). Since such a pre-suit \nnotice letter can satisfy the knowledge requirement for pleading willful and induced \ninfringement , see, e.g., Cloud Farm Assocs., L.P. v. Volkswagen Group of Am., Inc., 2012 WL \n306939, at *3 (D. Del. July 27, 2012); Bobcar Media, LLC v. Aardvark Event Logistics, Inc., \n2017 WL 74729, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2017), it follows that the original complaint is likewise \nsufficient.2 Permitting the original complaint to supply the requisite knowledge does not, \ntherefore, alter any pleading requirement. \n2. Tonal next contends that \"a plaintiff cannot 'prove an element of a legal claim \nwith evidence that the plaintiff filed the claim.\"' (Objs. at 5) ( quoting ZapFraud, Inc. v. \nBarracuda Networks , Inc., 528 F. Supp. 3d 247,251 (D. Del. 2021)) According to Tonal, \n\"because the claim for induced or willful infringement is predicated on knowledge that is \npurportedly gained (if at all) after the complaint is filed, the claims in that complaint are \nnecessarily predicated onpotentialfuture conduct.\" (Objs. at 5-6) To be clear, iFIT did not \nallege induced and willful infringement in the original complaint. Instead, iFIT alleged induced \nand willful infringement in the amended complaint on the basis of Tonal's continued \ninfringement after it became aware of the allegations in the original complaint. \"Whereas an \noriginal complaint alleging induced infringement based on post-filing knowledge is necessarily \n2 As Judge Burke points out, \"there is no meaningful difference \" between relying on an original \ncomplaint and relying on a notice letter sent on the same day of the complaint to establish the \nknowledge element for induced and willful infringement claims alleged in an amended \ncomplaint. (See Report at 6 n.5) \n3 forward-looking, an amended pleading looks back to conduct that actually occurred since the \nfiling of a prior version of the complaint. \" Helios Steaming, LLC v. Vudu, Inc., 2020 WL \n2332045, at *5 (D. Del. May 11, 2020). Thus, at the time of filing the amended complaint, \niFIT' s good faith basis for asserting induced and willful infringement claims did not need to rely \non any \"potential future conduct.\" See Valinge Innovation AB v. Halstead New England Corp., \n2018 WL 2411218, at *11 (D. Del. May 29, 2018) (finding that \"relevant date for determining \nwhich conduct is pre-suit\" for purposes of alleging willful infringement is \"the date of the filing \nof the willful infringement claim at issue\"); Clouding IP, 2013 WL 2293452 , at *4 (finding that \ntime between filing of original complaint and filing of amended complaint should be deemed \n\"pre-filing\" with respect to willful infringement claims alleged in amended complaint). \n3. Tonal further insists that \"[p]ermitting a patentee to allege induced and willful \ninfringement in an amended complaint after the filing of the initial complaint does not solve this \nproblem,\" adding that \"the premise that a claim can be created by filing a claim does not exist in \nany other field of a law, including those with scienter requirements .\" (Objs. at 6) However, as \niFIT correctly points out (see Resp. at 1-2), the Federal Circuit has recognized, at least for \ninduced infringement, the service of the original complaint is sufficient to support, in an \namended complaint, post-suit knowledge of a patent's existence and infringement. See In re Bill \nof Lading Transmission and Processing Sys. Patent Litig., 681 F.3d 1323, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012) \n(finding allegation that defendant became \"aware of the [asserted patent], at the latest, in March \nof 2009 when it was served with the complaint\" supports induced infringement claim in amended \ncomplaint); see also Labyrinth Optical Techs., LLC v. Fujitsu Am., Inc., 2013 WL 12126111, at \n*4-6 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2013) (\"Bill of Lading establishes that alleging that a defendant learned of \n4 a patent from an earlier pleading in the case is adequate to allege the knowledge component of \nindirect infringement \"). \n4. Tonal's argument that a rule against using a claim to create another new claim is \n\"especially germane\" to willful infringement is also unpersuasive . (See Objs. at 7) The Court \nsees no reason why a defendant who chooses to continue engaging in an infringing act should \navoid liability for willful infringement \" simply because it happened to learn of the patent in \nconnection with a lawsuit.\" Trading Techs. Int'!, Inc. v. ECG Partners, Inc., 2011 WL 3946581, \nat *4 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 2, 2011). \n5. Finally, Tonal contends that permitting a patentee to prove the knowledge and \nintent for claims of induced and willful infringement by filing a complaint will undermine \njudicial economy. (Objs. at 8-9) Tonal has not pointed to any empirical study -nor, in this \nCourt's view, made any persuasive showing-that these fears are well-founded. \"[N]othing \nprevents a plaintiff from filing a new lawsuit alleging that the knowledge requirement is \nestablished because the [d]efendant is aware of the previous lawsuit.\" Proxyconn Inc. v. \nMicrosoft Corp., 2012 WL 1835680, at *6 (C.D. Cal. May 16, 2012); see also ZapFraud , 528 F. \nSupp. 3d at 251 n.4. A plaintiff may also file a motion to supplement pleadings , pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d), to plead post-suit facts. (See Report ,r 7 n.5) It is not \nclear that the mechanism approved by the undersigned Judge has any greater impact on judicial \neconomy than these alternatives. \n6. The Court recognizes that its holding today contradicts those of other judges, \nincluding judges in this very District. See, e.g., ZapFraud , 528 F. Supp. 3d at 252; Wrinkl v. \nFacebook , Inc., 2021 WL 4477022, at *7 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021). It is consistent, however, \nwith the view the undersigned Judge has taken previously. See, e.g., Clouding IP, 2013 WL \n5 2293452, at *4; Gammino v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 2013 WL 6154569, at *4 (D. Del. Nov. 22, \n2013). As the Court is unaware of any controlling authority requiring a different outcome, \nTonal's motion to dismiss the post-suit claims is denied. \nMarch 30, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware \n6 HONORABLE LEONARD P.
