Williams", "date": "09-20-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCORY BONE and LUIS CARRILLO , \nIndividually and for others similarly \nsituated, \nPlaintiffs , \nCivil Action No. 21-1460-GBW \nV. \nXTO ENERGY , INC., \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington , Delaware this 20th day of September , 2022. \nHaving reviewed the parties' briefing and other materials filed with respect to Defendant \nXTO Energy, Inc.'s (\"XTO\") motion to stay pending the Supreme Court of the United States of \nAmerica's decision in Hewitt v. Helix Energy Solutions , Inc., No. 19-20023 (5th Cir. 2021), cert. \ngranted, 2022 WL 1295708 (U.S. May 2, 2022) (No. 21-984), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nXTO's motion (D.I. 94) is GRANTED , for the reasons stated below. It is further ORDERED that, \nwithin fourteen days following the ruling in Hewitt, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith \nand file a joint status report to notify the Court on the implications of that decision on each parties' \nrespective positions. \n1. On September 25, 2020, Plaintiffs Cory Bone (\"Bone\") and Luis Carrillo (\"Carillo\") \n(collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed an Amended Collective Complaint against XTO in the United \nStates District Court for the District of New Mexico to recover overtime allegedly owed to \nPlaintiffs and purportedly similar workers pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act \"(FLSA\"), 29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 207, et seq. D.I. 25. In response, XTO filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended \n1 Collective Complaint (D.I. 28), asserting that Plaintiffs ' definitions of the putative class of workers \nand collective claims are overly broad and jurisdictionally deficient. Concurrently with its Motion \nto Dismiss, XTO filed an Answer to Plaintiffs ' Collective Amended Complaint, asserting, among \nothers, the affirmative defense that Plaintiffs and allegedly similar situated workers are exempt \nfrom the FLSA's overtime provision under the highly compensated employee (\"HCE\") exemption. \nD.I. 29. \n2. On September 22, 2021, the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico \ngranted in part XTO's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule \n12(b )(2), holding that Plaintiffs failed to establish personal jurisdiction over claims by certain \nmembers of the purported collective class of workers. D.I. 58. In response, Plaintiffs filed a \nMotion to Transfer Venue (D.I. 59), which XTO opposed. D.I. 60. The case was then transferred \nto this Court on October 15, 2021. D.I. 61. \n3. On February 16, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Conditional Certification and Court\u00ad\nAuthorized Notice, along with a Motion for Expedited Consideration, requesting the Court \nconditionally certify a putative class of similarly situated workers and provide notice to such \npurported members. D.I. 74. XTO opposes Plaintiffs ' motion. D.I. 80. \n4. On May 2, 2022, while litigation matters in the present dispute were ongoing, the Supreme \nCourt granted certiorari to review the Fifth Circuit's en bane decision in Hewitt and address the \ncircuit split regarding whether the detailed requirements of the reasonable relationship test, 29 \nC.F .R. \u00a7 541.604, apply to an employee who qualifies under the HCE exemption of the FLSA. 29 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 541.601(a)(l). It is set for oral argument in early October. \n5. On May 19, 2022, XTO filed a Motion to Stay proceedings pending the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Hewitt. D.I. 94. Plaintiffs contest the Motion to Stay. D.I. 100. While the parties \n2 disagree about the impact the Supreme Court's decision in Hewitt will have on this case, neither \nparty claims that the decision will be irrelevant. \n6. A court has discretionary authority to grant a motion to stay. See Dentsply Int'! Inc. v. Kerr \nMfg. Co., 734 F. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Del. 1990). Courts generally consider three factors to \ndetermine whether a stay is appropriate: (1) whether granting the stay will simplify the issues for \ntrial; (2) the status of the litigation, particularly whether discovery is complete and a trial date has \nbeen set; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non-movant to suffer undue prejudice from any \ndelay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage. See Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco \nHoldings LLC, C.A. No. 15-1168-LPS , 2021 WL 616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021) (citing \nEthicon LLC v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., C.A. No. 17-871-LPS , 2019 WL 1276029, at *1 (D. Del. \nMar. 20, 2019)). In this action, these factors favor granting a stay. \n7. A stay would simplify the issues before this Court. To be considered exempt from overtime \nunder the HCE exemption , the FLSA requires the employee satisfy three tests: salary level, salary \nbasis, and duties. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.601(a). The Supreme Court's decision in Hewitt will not only \ndecide whether HCEs must additionally meet the reasonable relationship test of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n541.604, but will also resolve whether the reasonable relationship test underlies the salary basis \ntest. Thus, the reasonable relationship test acts as the linchpin to interpreting the salary basis test. \nContinuing this litigation while one of those three tests hangs in the balance of the Supreme Court's \nreview would be contrary to judicial economy , while wasting the time and resources of both \nparties. \n8. The stage of this litigation weighs in favor of a stay. This dispute is at an early juncture, \nwith limited fact discovery having been conducted and no trial date set. \n3 9. A stay will not unduly prejudice Plaintiffs or other similarly situated workers. Rather, the \nCourt finds that both parties would benefit from a stay of the present matter in order to gain \npertinent insight that the Supreme Court may offer regarding the HCE exemption. Such insight \nmay narrow the issues presented and streamline discovery. While the Court is aware of Plaintiffs ' \npending Motion for Conditional Certification (D.I. 74), Plaintiffs have not identified an instance \nwhere granting a stay will result in the loss of claims due to the expiration of the statute of \nlimitations of the prospective putative class members. \n10. Thus, given the pertinent factors weigh in favor of a stay, XTO's Motion to Stay this \nlitigation pending the Supreme Court's decision in Hewitt is GRANTED. Either party may seek \nleave to lift the stay for good cause shown at an earlier time, if e ved necessary and appropriate. \n4 GREGORY B. WILLIAMS \nU.S. DISTRJCT JUDGE "}
