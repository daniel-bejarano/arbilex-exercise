Believing this \nsearch violated the Fourth Amendment and that the officers committed a range of tort \noffenses, the family sued in this Court.  The Defendants now move to dismiss the complaint. \nFor the reasons below, I will dismiss the NCCPD  as a defendant.  I also will dismiss \nCounts IV, V, and VI, as the McCarys have not presented sufficient factual allegations to \novercome the immunity Delaware\u2019s County and Municipal Tort Claims Act, 10 Del. C. \n\u00a7 4011, grants to county employees.\n1  I will grant the McCarys leave to amend tho se\ncounts\n.  All other requests to dismiss are denied.  \n1 Intentional infliction of emotional distress is the sixth count (and will be referred to as \nCount VI) even though the amended complaint mistakenly labels it as Count VII.  Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 1 of 12 PageID #: 2022 \n I. BACKGROUND2 \nMatthew McCary was in bed when Officers Cunningham and Simonetti raided his \nhome in Bear, Delaware, at 5:30 a.m. on May 9, 2019.  Am. Compl. (Doc. 26) \u00b6 \u00b6 12, 14, \n34.  They \u201cdragged\u201d him out, \u201cslammed\u201d him to the floor, and  applied zip-ties.  Id. \u00b6 34.  \nS.M., a minor, was coming out of the shower when the officers found her.  Id. \u00b6 15.  They \ndrew their guns, handcuffed her naked, and detained her in the living room.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 15\u201317.  \nVenus McCary, also in the house that morning, was \u201chandcuffed\u201d and \u201cviolently dragged [] by her arms outside.\u201d  Id. \u00b6 18.  All three were held at gunpoint, without food or drink, \nfor more than five hours while the police searched the home.  Id. \u00b6 \u00b6 17, 20, 24, 37.  \nThe officers, it seems, suspected another resident of the McCarys\u2019 home, Cameron, \nof a drug offense.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 22\u201323.  They ordered Venus to \u201ctell them where the alleged \ndrugs were or they would shoot her son\u201d and accused  her of selling drugs herself.  Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 22\u201323.  Though their search turned up empty, the police tore the house apart looking, \napparently destroying much of its  contents.  Id. \u00b6 \u00b6 29\u201330, 33.  \nThe McCarys have sued over this incident.  Though they at first filed a pro se \ncomplaint, they obtained counsel and filed an amended complaint in September 2021.  Doc. \n26.  The Defendants now move to dismiss.  Doc. 41.  \n \n2 This section recites the factual allegations from the amended complaint that, to decide  \nthis motion to dismiss, I must accept as true.  Newman v. Beard, 617 F.3d 775, 779 (3d Cir. \n2010).  Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 2033 \n II. DISCUSSION3 \nA. New Castle County and New Castle County Police Division  \nFundamental to deciding the motion to dismiss is determining who in fact the \nDefendants are.  When the McCarys filed their amended complaint, what looks like a  \ntypographical error injected confusion into this suit.  The complaint\u2019s caption listed four \ndefendants: Officer B. Cunningham, Officer M. Simonetti, John Doe Police Officers, and \nthe New Castle County Police Department.  Am. Compl. at 1.  But the body of the \ncomplaint lists New Castle County , \u201ca domestic municipal corporation duly organized and \nexisting under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware,\u201d rather than the police \ndivision as a defendant.  Id \u00b6 5.  It goes on repeatedly to reference  the County, rather than \nthe NCCPD, as a defendant throughout the recitation of the facts and counts.4  See id. \u00b6\u00b6 6\u2013\n7, 42, 45\u2013 48, 62.  So which one is the defendant, New Castle County or the NCCPD?  \nFrom a legal standpoint, it has to be the County.  The parties agree that the NCCPD \nis not a suable entity under Delaware law.5  See Defs.\u2019 Br. at 8; Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 7.  Yet the  \nDefendants insist the County has not been named a party properly under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 10(a).  This rule, after all, requires the complaint\u2019s title to \u201cname all the \nparties,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a), and New Castle County isn\u2019t listed there.   \n \n3 The McCarys\u2019 amended complaint alleges constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983, so this Court has jurisdiction over those claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and \nsupplemental jurisdiction over the tort claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1367(a).  \n4 Though the complaint references the \u201cNew Castle County Police\u201d and the \u201cpolice \ndepartment,\u201d the body of the complaint never identifies it as a defendant.  See Am. Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 14, 42, 4 5\u201346, 48.  \n5 I will thus dismiss NCCPD from this case.  Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 2044 \n The caption, though,  \u201cis not determinative as to the identity of the parties to the \naction.\u201d  See Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure  \n\u00a7 1321 (4th ed. 2018).  Instead, most federal courts of appeals have taken a more nuanced \napproach to deciphering who is a party.  E ven if not named in the caption, a party may still \nbe properly before the court \u201cif the allegations in the body of the complaint make . . . plain \n[it] is intended as a defendant.\u201d  See Rice v. Hamilton Air Force Base Commissary, 720 \nF.2d 1082, 1085 (9th Cir. 1983); Mitchell v. Maynard, 80 F.3d 1433, 1441 (10th Cir. 1996) \n(same); Kanuszewski v. Mich. Dept. of Health & Hum. Servs., 927 F.3d 396, 406 n.4 (6th \nCir. 2019) (holding parents of plaintiff minor children may assert their own rights because \n\u201cthe Complaint provided Defendants adequate notice that the parents were asserting their \nown rights \u201d even though they were not individually listed as parties in the caption).  \nThis complaint plainly shows New Castle County is an intended defendant.  Not \nonly is an entire paragraph dedicated to listing it\u2014not the NCCPD\u2014 as a party under the \nheading \u201cPARTIES,\u201d see Am. Compl. \u00b6  5, but the pleading is also full of references to the \nCounty as a defendant \u2014including in Count III, where a failure to train and supervise claim \nis lodged solely against the County, id. \u00b6\u00b6 44\u2013 48.  These allegations are more than enough \nto give adequate notice.  See Kanuszewski , 927 F.3d at  406 n.4.  \nBut just because the McCarys clearly intended for New Castle County to be a \ndefendant, that does not mean it is properly before this Court.  On top of naming a party in \nthe complaint, a plaintiff must serve process on a defendant within 90 days of the Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 2055 \n complaint\u2019s  filing.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).6  If the plaintiff fails to do so, the Court \u201cmust \ndismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made \nwithin a specified time. \u201d  Id.  Here it is undisputed the McCarys failed to serve the County \nwithin the allotted time.  See Docs. 37 \u201339; Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Br. at 7\u20138.   So all that\u2019s left for me \nto decide is whether to dismiss the County or allow additional time for service.  \nThe Third Circuit has outlined a two-part inquiry for these situations.  To begin, the \nCourt \u201cmust determine whether good cause exists for the failure to have effected service \nin a timely manner.\u201d  McCurdy v. Am. Bd. of Plastic Surgery, 157 F.3d 191, 196 (3d Cir. \n1998).  If the plaintiff shows good cause, \u201cthe extension must be granted.\u201d  Id.  If not, the \nCourt moves on to consider whether to \u201cgrant the extension in the sound exercise of its \ndiscretion.\u201d  Id.  Though neither the rule nor the Third Circuit prescribes a precise formula \nfor deciding when to grant an extension, the Advisory Committee notes on Rule 4(m) \u201cprovide[] some guidance as to what factors the district court should consider.\u201d  Petrucelli \nv. Bohringer & Ratzinger, 46 F.3d 1298, 1305 (3d Cir. 1995).  The non-exhaustive list of factors includes whether \u201cthe applicable statute of limitations would bar the refiled action, or if the defendant is evading service or conceals a defect in attempted service .\u201d  Id. at \n1305\u201306 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1993 amendment).  \nTo the first prong of the inquiry, the McCarys do not even try to argue good cause \nhere.  And I will not try to supply the argument for them.  See Morrissey v. Mayorkas, 17 \nF.4th 1150, 1158 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (holding the District Court\u2019s  failure sua sponte  to \n \n6 Rule 4 requires a plaintiff to serve the complaint and a summons on each defendant to \nnotify them of the pending lawsuit.  See generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 4.  Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 2066 \n identify good cause for a Rule 4(m) extension is not an abuse of discretion).   \nAs to the second part, I will allow the McCarys  another 21 days to serve the County.  \nThe factors weighing for and against this extension are split.  On the one hand, the McCarys  \nare represented by counsel and thus should have been aware of their obligation to serve the \nCounty.  And there is no evidence that it was evading service.  On the other, though, the \nCounty appears to have had actual notice of the lawsuit  and, it seems, will not be prejudiced \nby an extension.  See Defs.\u2019 Reply at 5\u2013 6; Doc. 49-1.  More importantly, the statute of \nlimitations would bar the Plaintiffs\u2019 refiling of their claim against the County.  See Wallace \nv. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) (noting for \u00a7 1983 claims that federal courts apply the \nstate\u2019s statute of limitations for personal  injury); 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119 (setting Delaware\u2019s \npersonal injury statute of limitations at two years).  Though \u201crunning of the statute of \nlimitations does not require the district court to extend time for service of process,\u201d \nPetrucelli, 46 F.3d at  1306 (emphasis added), it tips the balance in favor of extension here.7 \nB. Officer Cunningham and Officer Simonetti  \nThe McCarys have also brought several claims against Officers Cunningham and \nSimonetti, the two persons who allegedly spearheaded the May 9 raid.  These include \nexcessive force, false arrest, and false imprisonment in violation of \u00a7 1983 (Count I), \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment under \u00a7 1983 (Count II), assault and battery (Count \nIV), and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VI).8  The officers urge \n \n7 Because I am dismissing NCCPD, and New Castle County has not yet been served \nprocess, I will not address the argument that the McCarys failed to allege sufficiently a \nclaim against the County in Count III of the amended complaint.  \n8 They also are suing John Doe officers for assault and battery (Count IV), failure to Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 2077 \n dismissal on two grounds.  First, they argue the amended complaint falls short of the Rule \n8(a)(2) pleading standard.  And second, they assert that under Delaware law they are \nimmune from suit for the tort claims.   \n1. Adequacy of Pleading (Rule 8)  \nRule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure places \u201c minimal burdens on the \nplaintiff at the pleading stage.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health , 938 F.3d 69, 92 (3d Cir. 2019)  \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  It requires simply that the complaint contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 8(a)(2).  The \u201cshort\u201d statement requirement allows the Court to dismiss an \u201cexcessively \nprolix and overlong complaint,\u201d while the \u201cplain\u201d statement prerequisite ensures the \npleading \u201cidentifies discrete defendants and the actions taken by these defendants in regard \nto the plaintiff\u2019s claims .\u201d  Garrett, 938 F.3d at 93 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nCunningham and Simonetti contend the McCarys\u2019 amended complaint falls short of \nthis pleading standard because they \u201cfailed to attribute any conduct alleged in the Amended \nComplaint to any specific individual.\u201d   Defs.\u2019 Br. at 11.   They particularly object to the \ncomplaint\u2019s repeated references to the \u201cindividual defendants\u201d and \u201cdefendants\u201d generally \nwithout differentiating between them.  For example, the complaint alleges that \u201c the named \ndefendants drew guns on the minor plaintiff,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he individual defendants \ndemanded that Venus McCary tell them where the alleged drugs were or they would shoot \nher son.\u201d  Am. Compl. at 4.  It does not mention specific names.  \n \nintervene (Count V), and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VI).  Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 2088 \n The officers, though, exaggerate the vagueness of these allegations.  When \u201creading \nthe allegations sensibly and as a whole, there is no genuine uncertainty regarding who is \nresponsible for what. \u201d  Engel v. Buchan, 710 F.3d 698, 710 (7th Cir. 2013).  The Plaintiffs\u2019 \n12-page amended complaint lodges claims against only two named individual defendants \n(Cunningham and Simonetti), one institutional defendant (New Castle County), and \nunknown John Doe defendants.  Based on this limited cast of defendants, when  the \ncomplaint refers to the \u201cindividual defendants\u201d or \u201cnamed defendants,\u201d it is obvious to the \nreader that it is referring to the two named individuals\u2014 Cunningham and Simonetti.  The \nspecific personal conduct mentioned \u2014like the threats, handcuffing, or assault\u2014obviously \ncould not be taken by a non-personal entity like the County.  And when the complaint intends to include the John Doe defendants, it explicitly refers to them as the \u201cunknown \npolice officers\u201d and \u201cother John Doe officers.\u201d  Am Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  36\u201337.  Though the \ncomplaint does not differentiate between Cunningham\u2019s  and Simonetti\u2019s actions, that is \nbecause they are accused of acting jointly.  See Engel, 710 F.3d at  710.  The counts at the \nend of the complaint also state by name which claim is lodged against which defendant, giving adequate notice to each what conduct he is allegedly responsible for.  See Am. \nCompl. at 6\u201310.  \nThis is far from a \u201cshotgun pleading \u201d where a plaintiff \u201cassert[s] multiple claims \nagainst multiple defendants without specifying which of the defendants are responsible for \nwhich acts or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is brought against.\u201d  Weiland \nv. Palm Beach Cn ty. Sheriff\u2019s Off., 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015).  Compare the \nMcCarys\u2019 complaint to the one in Bartol v. Barrowclough, where the District Court Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 2099 \n dismissed a pleading because the plaintiff\u2019s 54-page complaint brought 13 counts against \n\u201cany combination of well over seven distinct defendants.\u201d  251 F. Supp. 3d 855, 860 (E.D. \nPa. 2017).  Not only was it unclear what actions each defendant allegedly took, but (unlike the McCarys\u2019 complaint) the plaintiff also failed to define which counts were brought \nagainst which specific defendants.  Id.  Similarly, in Grieveson v. Anderson, the Seventh \nCircuit affirmed dismissal under Rule 8 because a \u201cprisoner asserted \u00a7  1983 claims against \nseven different officers arising from seven different attacks without tying any particular \nofficer to any particular injury.\u201d  Engel, 710 F.3d at 710 (citing Grieveson, 538 F.3d 763, \n777\u201378 (7th Cir. 2008) ). \nThe McCarys\u2019 complaint does not suffer from the type of confusion that pervaded \nthose cases.  It presents a straightforward narrative: on a single occasion, Cunningham and \nSimonetti  entered the McCarys\u2019 home, threatened them while the John Doe defendants \nwatched, and detained them for more than five hours.  So I will not dismiss the claims \nagainst the officers on Rule 8 grounds.  \n2. Immunity from Suit (10 Del. C. \u00a7  4011)  \nSome allegations against the officers, though, are deficient.  The McCarys have \nbrought three tort clai ms: assault and battery (Count IV, against Cunningham,  Simonetti, \nand John Doe officers ), failure to intervene (Count V, against John Doe officers ), and \nintentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VI, against Cunningham, Simonetti, and \nJohn Doe officers).  Yet under Delaware\u2019s County and Municipal Tort Claims Act  \n(CMTCA) , \u201call governmental entities and their employees shall be immune from suit on \nany and all tort claims seeking recovery of damages.\u201d  10 Del. C. \u00a7 4011(a).  The Act has Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 9 of 12 PageID #: 21010 \n one narrow exception: \u201cAn employee may be personally liable for acts or omissions \ncausing property damage, bodily injury or death in instances in which the governmental \nentity is immune under this section, but only for those acts which were not within the scope \nof employment or which were performed with wanton negligence or wilful and malicious \nintent.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 4011(c).   The Defendants seek dismissal of all tort claims based on the \nCMTCA,  Defs.\u2019 Br. at 14\u201317, while the McCarys insist their claims fall under the Act\u2019s \nexception, Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 11\u201312.   \nFor conduct to fall within the CMTCA\u2019s exception, it must satisfy two conditions.  \nFirst, it must \u201ccaus [e] property damage, bodily injury or death.\u201d  10 Del. C. \u00a7 4011(c).  And \nthen, only if that condition is satisfied, it must either have been done \u201c not within the scope \nof employment\u201d or \u201cwith wanton negligence or wilful and malicious intent.\u201d  Id.  The \nMcCarys\u2019 allegations , at a minimum, fail to satisfy that first condition.  Take Count VI, \nintentional inflic tion of emotional distress.  The McCarys allege they \u201csustained severe and \nsignificant emotional distress including loss of appetite, inability to sleep, anxiety, \ndepression and post-traumatic stress.\u201d  Am. Compl. \u00b6  55.  But Delaware courts have \nconsistently held these types of injuries do not qualify as \u201cbodily injury.\u201d  See, e.g., Dickerson v. Phillips , No. N10C-08-221, 2012 WL 2236709, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. June \n13, 2012) (\u201cIt is well-established that allegations of emotional distress do not amount to \nbodily injury for purposes of the Tort Claims Act.\u201d); McCaffrey v. City of Wilmington, No. \nN12C-01138, 2012 WL 3518119, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 9, 2012) (finding defendants  \nimmune from suit because of the \u201cabsence of any allegation of injury beyond emotional \ndistress\u201d); King v. McKenna, No. K15C-03 -028, 2015 WL 4040437, at *7 (Del. Super. Ct. Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 10 of 12 PageID #: 21111 \n June 29, 2015) (same) ; see also Valentin v. Wysock, No. 1:21-cv -00399-SB, 2022 WL \n611061, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 3, 2022) (finding the plaintiff failed to overcome immunity \nwhen she alleged \u201cpain and suffering, embarrassment, loss of reputation, and loss of \nenjoyment of the value of her home\u201d because mental anguish does not count as \u201cbodily \ninjury\u201d (citing Wilcher v. Wilmington, 60 F. Su pp. 2d 298, 306 \u201307 (D. Del. 1999) ) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (alterations adopted)).  Because the McCarys\u2019 only allegation of \ninjury for Count V I is emotional distress, I will dismiss it with leave to amend.  \nCount IV for assault and battery is also lacking.  In the factual allegations, the \nMcCarys only once mention bodily injury, claiming the police officers \u201cdragged [Matthew] \nout of bed,\u201d \u201cslammed [him] against the floor, and zip tied [him] causing physical injuries \nto him.\u201d  Am. Compl. \u00b6  34.  In the paragraph describing Count IV, they also simply state \nthat the \u201cillegal assault and arrest of plaintiffs constitute[] an assault and battery . . . as a \nresult of which plaintiffs were physically injured as well as sustaining severe and \nsignificant emotional distress.\u201d  Id. \u00b6 50.  As explained above, allegations of emotional \ndistress cannot overcome immunity.  And the se allegations of \u201cphysical injury\u201d are far too \nconclusory.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556\u2013 57 (2007).  Nowhere do the \nPlaintiffs describe what \u201cphysical injuries\u201d they suffered, if any.9  See Valentin, 2022 WL \n611061, at *2 (holding that the  plaintiff\u2019s allegation that she suffered \u201cbodily injury\u201d when \nthe police officer handcuffed her was too conclusory to overcome immunity).  But because \nthe McCarys may be able to cure this inadequate pleading with specific allegations of \n \n9 Though their complaint alleges the officers\u2019 search caused property damage, see Am. \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33, none of the tort claims are tied to that alleged injury. Case 1:21-cv-00667-TLA   Document 50   Filed 07/18/22   Page 11 of 12 PageID #: 21212 \n bodily injury, I will dismiss Count IV without prejudice and with leave to amend.  \nFinally, I will sua sponte dismiss with leave to amend Count V against the John Doe \ndefendants, who are also allegedly employees  of County.  This failure-to-intervene count \ncontains no allegations that the John Doe officers caused bodily injury, much less that they  \nacted outside their \u201cscope of employment\u201d or with \u201cwanton negligence or wilful and \nmalicious intent.\u201d  10 Del. C. \u00a7 4011(c).  So, unless the complaint is amended adequately,  \nthese defendants are entitled to immunity.  \n* * * \n For all these reasons, I will dismiss NCCPD as a defendant.  I will also dismiss \nCounts IV, V, and VI with leave to amend.  The motion to dismiss will be denied for the \nremaining counts.  The Plaintiffs have 21 days to serve New Castle County and to file an \namended complaint if they wish.
