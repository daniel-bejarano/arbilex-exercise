{"case_name": "Green v. Poorman et al", "case_number": "20-85", "judge": "Magistrate Judge Sherry R. Fallon", "date": "02-17-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nCARY GREEN )\nPlaintiff, 5\nv. Civil Action No. 20-85-SRF\nPHILLIP POORMAN, LT. GREGORY\nESPOSITO, and SHUKRIYA JENKINS, )\nDefendants. }\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nIn this action filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, plaintiff Cary Green (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) seeks\nrelief for alleged civil rights violations committed by Officer Phillip Poorman! (\u201cPoorman\u201d) and\nLt. Gregory Esposito (\u201cEsposito;\u201d collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d).? Pending before the court is\nDefendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.3\n(D.1. 50) For the following reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is GRANTED\n\nwith respect to Esposito and DENIED with respect to Poorman.*\n\n' The complaint refers to Poorman as \u201cSgt.\u201d (D.L. 1, Ex. A at 911) The parties\u2019 joint stipulated\nfacts refer to Poorman as \u201cOfficer.\u201d (D.I. 52 at { 6)\n\n2 Plaintiff also brought causes of action against defendant Shukriya Jenkins in this matter. (D.L.\n1-1 at 15-16) Ms. Jenkins did not respond to the complaint, and the Clerk of Court entered a\ndefault in appearance as to Ms. Jenkins pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(a) on\nFebruary 22, 2021. (D.I. 27) Plaintiff has asked the court to allow the case to go to trial to\ndetermine the amount of damages before formally seeking entry of default judgment under Rule\n55(b)(2), because \u201cthe damages are the same for all defendants.\u201d (D.I. 25 at 2) The pending\nmotion for summary judgment was brought only by defendants Poorman and Esposito. (D.I. 50)\n3 The briefing and other filings related to the pending motion for summary judgment are found at\nD.I. 51, D.L. 52, D.L. 53, D.I. 54, D.I. 55, and D.I. 57.\n\n4 The parties consented to jurisdiction by a U.S. Magistrate Judge on February 8, 2022. (D.I. 60)\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn October 8, 2017, Plaintiff and his cell mate, Gerald Nash (\u201cNash\u201d), attempted an\nescape from the roof of a prison building using bed sheets tied to a drainpipe. (D.I. 52 at {| 1-2)\nPlaintiff claims that Nash coerced him into participating in the escape attempt and ordered\nPlaintiff to climb down the sheets to the ground. (/d.) However, the makeshift rope could not\nsupport Plaintiff's weight and he fell to the ground, losing consciousness. (Jd. at [J 2-3) When\nPlaintiff awoke and realized the extent of his injuries, he tried to get the attention of the security\nstaff by shaking and climbing on the outer fence. (/d. at ]3) A vehicle approached, and an\nofficer ordered him to lie face down on the ground. (Jd at 44) The officer then cuffed his hands\nbehind his back. (/d. at \u00a75) Plaintiff informed an officer that Nash was on the roof with him.\n(id.\n\nEsposito, Poorman, and other security staff arrived at the scene. (/d. at ]6) Plaintiff\nalleges that Poorman pulled Plaintiff to his feet, repeatedly pushed him face first into the fence,\npunched him after placing him in the patrol car, ordered another officer to pepper spray him, and\nthreatened him with further violence. (/d. at 7) Plaintiff claims that Esposito witnessed\nPoorman\u2019s actions. (/d. at ]9) Poorman denies using any unjustified force against Plaintiff, and\nEsposito denies seeing Poorman mistreat Plaintiff. (/d. at {[ 8, 10) Plaintiff was subsequently\ntaken to the hospital to be treated for multiple breaks and fractures in his back, hip, and wrist.\n(id. at $11)\n\nOn November 1, 2017, Plaintiff filed Grievance No. 385833, which accused Poorman of\nrepeatedly smashing Plaintiff's face into a fence, pulling Plaintiff by the handcuffs attached to\nPlaintiffs broken wrist, punching Plaintiff repeatedly while Plaintiff was handcuffed in the back\n\nof a patrol car, and spraying pepper spray in Plaintiff's face while he was restrained in the back\nof the patrol car. (D.I. 16, Ex. A at DEF000017) Plaintiff's grievance was subsequently\nretumed as unprocessed. (/d. at DEF000018-19)\n\nPlaintiff initiated a civil proceeding in Delaware Superior court on October 4, 2019,\nasserting causes of action against Defendants for violations of his constitutional rights in addition\nto state law tort claims. (D.I. 1-1) The action was removed to this court on January 21, 2020.\n(D.L. 1) Defendants promptly moved to dismiss the action based on Plaintiff's alleged failure to\nexhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit. (D.I.3) On July 22, 2020, the court\nissued a Memorandum Order denying the motion to dismiss, but granting Defendants\u2019 request to\nconduct an evidentiary analysis on the issue of exhaustion. (D.I. 7) The parties followed up with\na joint status report on November 23, 2020, in which Defendants agreed not to pursue dismissal\nof Poorman on exhaustion grounds. (D.I. 16) Defendants maintained their position regarding\nPlaintiff's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies regarding Esposito. (Jd.)\n\nThe parties recently consented to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate Judge and agreed to\nwaive their right to a jury trial. (D.I. 59; D.I. 60) Accordingly, the undersigned judicial officer\nconverted the two-day jury trial to a bench trial, which is scheduled to proceed on March 3 and 4,\n2022. (D.I. 63 at J 6)\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those that could affect the outcome of the proceeding, and \u201ca\ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury\nto return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.\n\n2011) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).\n\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely disputed\nmaterial fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 321. The burden then shifts to the non-movant to\ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial, and the court must view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458,\n460-61 (3d Cir. 1989); Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). An assertion that a fact cannot\nbe\u2014or, alternatively, is\u2014genuinely disputed must be supported either by citing to \u201cparticular\nparts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored\ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the\nmotion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials,\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the\nmaterials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse\nparty cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) &\n(B). To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must \u201cdo more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586. The \u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not\ndefeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;\u201d rather, there must be\nenough evidence to enable a jury to reasonably find for the non-moving party on the issue. See\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 247-49. \u201cIf the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly\nprobative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d Jd. at 249-50 (internal citations omitted); see\nalso Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. If the non-movant fails to make a sufficient showing on an\nessential element of its case on which it bears the burden of proof, then the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Qualified Immunity\n\nDefendants contend that summary judgment should be granted because they are entitled\nto qualified immunity. (D.I. 51 at 3-9) Qualified immunity insulates government officials from\ncivil liability when performing discretionary functions \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate\n\u2018clearly established\u2019 statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.\u201d Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); see also Lamont v. New Jersey, 637\nF.3d 177, 182 (3d Cir. 2011). In assessing qualified immunity, a court must consider \u201c(1)\nwhether the officer violated a constitutional right, and (2) whether the right was clearly\nestablished, such that it would [have been] clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\nunlawful.\u201d /d. at 182 (citation and internal quotation omitted). A court may address the\nelements in either order. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009).\n\nThe Third Circuit has announced two supervisory rules for district courts at the summary\njudgment stage of qualified immunity cases. Williams v. City of York, Pa., 967 F.3d 252, 254-55\n(3d Cir. 2020). Under Forbes v. Township of Lower Merion, 313 F.3d 144 (3d Cir. 2002),\ndistrict courts are required \u201cto specify those material facts that are and are not subject to genuine\ndispute and explain their materiality.\u201d Jd. at 146. And under Grant v. City of Pittsburgh, 98 F.3d\n116, 126 (3d Cir. 1996), district courts must \u201canalyze separately, and state findings with respect\nto, the specific conduct of each [defendant].\u201d Jd. at 126. Proceeding under this framework, and\nupon consideration of the evidence specific to each of the moving Defendants, Defendants\u2019\n\nmotion for summary judgment is denied in part and granted in part.\n1. Violation of a constitutional right by Poorman\n\nDefendants argue that Plaintiff cannot satisfy the first inquiry in the qualified immunity\nanalysis because he has not shown enough facts to make out a claim for excessive force under\nthe Eighth Amendment. (D.I. 51 at 4) The Eighth Amendment protects convicted prisoners\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, and the Supreme Court has interpreted this prohibition to\nbar prison officials from using excessive force against inmates. U.S. Const. amend. VIII;\nWhitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 318-19 (1986); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1992).\nThe test for an Eighth Amendment claim of excessive force is \u201cwhether [the] force was applied\nin a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very\npurpose of causing harm.\u201d Giles v. Kearney, 571 F.3d 318, 326 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Whitley,\n475 U.S. at 319).> The relevant factors to consider are: \u201c(1) the need for the application of force;\n(2) the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used; (3) the extent of\ninjury inflicted; (4) the extent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably\nperceived by the responsible officials on the basis of the facts known to them; and (5) any efforts\nmade to temper the severity of a forceful response.\u201d Id.; see also Brooks v. Kyler, 204 F.3d 102,\n106 (3d Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is not appropriate where \u201cit appears that the evidence,\nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, will support a reliable inference of wantonness\n\nin the infliction of pain.\u201d Brooks, 204 F.3d at 106.\n\n5 Defendants\u2019 argument that the court must conduct a two-step analysis that includes subjective\nand objective components is misplaced. See Hudson, 503 U.S. at 9 (\u201cWhen prison officials\nmaliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, contemporary standards of decency always\nare violated. This is true whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise, the Eighth\nAmendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman,\ninflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury.\u201d).\n\n6\na. Need for application of force\n\nBeginning with the first factor, the need for force, it is established law that an officer\n\u201cmay not... use gratuitous force against an inmate who has been subdued.\u201d Giles, 571 F.3d at\n326. In Giles, the Third Circuit reversed and remanded the district court\u2019s order granting\nsummary judgment because a dispute of material fact existed as to whether the plaintiff had\nceased resisting when he was kicked or kneed in the side. Jd. at 327. The plaintiff was not yet in\nhandcuffs, but testified that he was on the ground, subdued, and nonresistant during the use of\nforce. Id.\n\nHere, the parties do not dispute that when Poorman arrived on the scene, Plaintiff was\nalready lying face down with his hands cuffed behind his back. (D.I. 52 at f] 4-6; D.I. 53 at\nJA183-84, 262-63) It is also undisputed that Plaintiff had complied with the orders of two other\nofficers before Poorman arrived. (/d.) Testimony from Esposito confirms that Plaintiff was\ninjured and in pain when he and Poorman arrived, and Plaintiff \u201cappeared frantic and was crying\nwhile stating that his back and arm were injured.\u201d (D.I. 53 at JA185) Poorman\u2019s testimony\nsuggests that any resistance by Plaintiff upon his arrival was minimal: \u201cIt was a little bit of a\nstruggle to get him to walk forward. We approached the patrol vehicle. There was a guardrail\nbetween us.... Trying to get him over it, we both tripped, causing us to fall into the side of the\ncar and then into the back of the car.\u201d (Jd. at JA266) As in Giles, Plaintiff was allegedly in\nhandcuffs for the duration of his interaction with Poorman. See Giles, 571 F.3d at 321 (\u201cBecause\nGiles testified that he was kicked and punched while fully restrained on the ground, after he\nceased to resist, Giles alleges conduct in violation of his Eighth Amendment rights that a\n\nreasonable officer would have known was a violation under the circumstances[.]\u201d).\nDefendants contend that the use of force by Poorman was necessary because Plaintiff was\nattempting to escape from prison, and the use of non-lethal force is justified in such\ncircumstances. (D.I. 51 at 6-7; D.I. 55 at 4-5) In support of their position, Defendants cite to the\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979), which emphasized the\nimportance of maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline in\nstating that \u201c[p]rison officials must be free to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of\ninmates and corrections personnel and to prevent escape or unauthorized entry.\u201d The court notes\nthat Bell v. Wolfish was not an Eighth Amendment case. See id. at 579 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\nMoreover, the asserted policy goal of \u201cprevent[ing] escape or unauthorized entry\u201d was not served\nhere because Plaintiff had already been captured and restrained before Poorman\u2019s arrival, and\nany escape attempt on Plaintiffs part was successfully thwarted. Viewing the facts in the light\nmost favorable to Plaintiff as the non-moving party, the court finds that a genuine dispute of\nmaterial fact exists regarding the need for the use of force.\n\nb. Relationship between the need and amount of force used\n\nThe second factor requires the court to consider the relationship between the need and the\namount of force that was used. See Giles, 571 F.3d at 326. Defendants argue that Poorman\u2019s use\nof force \u201cprevent[ed] Mr. Green\u2019s escape\u201d and that even \u201clethal force may have been\nconstitutionally permissible under the circumstances.\u201d (D.I. 51 at 6) A reasonable factfinder,\nhowever, could find that the force allegedly used by Poorman was not related to preventing\nPlaintiff's escape. As noted at \u00a7 II].A.1.a, supra, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was subdued and\napprehended before Poorman arrived. He was in pain from his earlier fall. And he was on the\n\ninside of the outer fence, on the ground, and in handcuffs. (D.I. 53 at JA183-85) Both the\namount of force used and the need for force are disputed material facts that cannot appropriately\nbe resolved on a motion for summary judgment.\nce. Extent of injury\n\nThe third factor requires the court to consider the extent of the injury inflicted in the use\nof force. See Giles, 571 F.3d at 326. However, the analysis generally \u201cmust be driven by the\nextent of the force and the circumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries.\u201d\nSmith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 647-48 (3d Cir. 2002) (noting that plaintiff could prevail on\nhis Eighth Amendment claim \u201cdespite the de minimis nature of his injuries\u201d); see also Hudson,\n503 USS. at 7 (\u201cThe absence of serious injury is . . . relevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry,\nbut does not end it.\u201d). For example, in Brooks, the Third Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s\ngrant of summary judgment even while noting that it was \u201capparent that the type of vicious,\nprolonged attack alleged by [plaintiff] would have resulted in far greater injuries than those\nwhich he indisputably sustained\u201d because \u201ca jury could find that the defendants acted . . . out of\nmalice for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d Brooks, 204 F.3d at 105, 109.\n\nHere, Plaintiff does not contend that Poorman was responsible for the fractures later\ndiagnosed at the hospital. (D.I. 52 at \u00a7 12) However, Plaintiff does contend that Poorman\npunched him repeatedly in the neck, torso, and back while he was handcuffed and compliant.\n(id. at 17) He plausibly alleges that Poorman\u2019s assault made the pain from his injuries\n\u201cdrastically worse.\u201d (D.I. 53 at JA096-97) For example, Plaintiff testified that Poorman picked\nPlaintiff up off the ground by the chain of his handcuffs after Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist.\n(D.I. 52 at [\u00a5 11-12; D.I. 53 at JA028, JA096) Poorman\u2019s own testimony confirms that he\npushed down on Plaintiff in the back seat of the patrol car. (D.I. 53 at JA268) Viewing these\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Poorman\nused force beyond what was necessary to return Plaintiff to prison. Consequently, a material\ndispute exists as to \u201cthe extent of the force and the circumstances in which it [was] applied[.]\u201d\nSmith, 293 F.3d at 648.\n\nd. Extent of threat to safety\n\nThe fourth factor requires the court to consider the extent of the threat to the safety of\nstaff and inmates, as reasonably perceived by the responsible officials on the basis of the facts\nknown to them. See Giles, 571 F.3d at 326. In Santiago v. Fields, 170 F. Supp. 2d 453 (D. Del.\n2001), the defendants maintained that they \u201cused force necessary only to subdue plaintiff and\nprotect their safety when he became combative.\u201d Jd. at 458. However, the court noted that\n\u201cplaintiff claim[ed] he was handcuffed behind his back at the time, reducing the threat of harm to\ndefendants,\u201d and held that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the extent of the threat.\nId.\n\nSimilarly, it is undisputed in this case that Plaintiff was either sitting or lying on the\nground and handcuffed behind his back, with at least three officers at the scene, when Poorman\narrived. Esposito testified that there were \u201c[u]pwards of 20\u201d Department of Corrections\npersonnel present at some time during the incident. (D.I. 53 at JA180) Under these\ncircumstances, a reasonable factfinder could determine that Plaintiff was no longer a security\nthreat during the interaction with Poorman and the escape attempt had ended.\n\ne. Efforts to temper the severity of the force\n\nUnder the fifth factor, the court considers any efforts made to temper the severity of a\nforceful response. See Giles, 571 F.3d at 326. Plaintiff claims that Poorman only stopped\n\u201csmashing\u201d his face into the fence because another male officer said, \u201cCome on, Phil. Stop,\u201d and\n\nan officer put a hand on Poorman\u2019s shoulder. (D.I. 53 at JA068, JA139-40) After the incident at\n\n10\nthe fence, Plaintiff contends that Poorman went on to assault him inside the patrol car. In\ncontrast, the first officer to interact with Plaintiff prior to Poorman\u2019s arrival initially drew his\nservice weapon, but he holstered the weapon without the use of force once Plaintiff complied\nwith his directives. (Jd. at JA307) A reasonable factfinder could compare and contrast the\nevidence of these two encounters and conclude that Poorman made no attempt to temper the\nseverity of his forceful response. In sum, genuine issues of material fact about Poorman\u2019s\nconduct are in dispute and must be reserved for trial.\n2. Whether the constitutional right was clearly established\n\nIn the alternative, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot satisfy the second inquiry\nbecause the allegedly violated constitutional right was not clearly established, and Poorman was\njustified in his belief that non-lethal force was necessary to prevent Plaintiff's escape. (D.I. 51 at\n8-9) \u201cClearly established means that, at the time of the officer's conduct, the law was\nsufficiently clear that every reasonable official would understand that what he is doing is\nunlawful.\u201d Dist. of Columbia v. Wesby, 138 S. Ct. 577, 589 (2018) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The court must focus on \u201cwhether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly\nestablished.\u201d Jacobs v. Cumberland County, 8 F.4th 187, 196 (3d Cir. 2021) (quoting Mullenix\nv. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 12 (2015)). Therefore, the central question is whether the existing law gave\nthe officer \u201cfair warning\u201d that his particular conduct was unlawful. Jd (quoting Schneyder v.\nSmith, 653 F.3d 313, 329 (3d Cir. 2011)).\n\nIn excessive use-of-force cases, \u201cofficers are entitled to qualified immunity unless\nexisting precedent \u2018squarely governs\u2019 the specific facts at issue.\u201d Jd. (quoting Kisela v. Hughes,\n138 S. Ct. 1148, 1153 (2018)). While \u201c[t]he caselaw does not have to be \u2018directly on point,\u2019\n\n[the] existing precedent must have placed the question of unlawfulness \u2018beyond debate.\u2019\u201d Jd.\n\n11\n(quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011)). Similar cases with analogous facts can\nhelp \u201cmove a case beyond the otherwise \u2018hazy border between excessive and acceptable force\u2019\nand thereby provide an officer notice that a specific use of force is unlawful.\u201d Jd. (quoting\nKisela, 138 S. Ct. at 1153).\n\nConstruing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the unlawfulness of the\nalleged conduct here is \u201cbeyond debate\u201d and far from the \u201chazy border\u201d described above.\u00ae The\nparties do not dispute that Plaintiff participated in an escape attempt. (D.I. 52 at ff 1-2) But it is\nalso undisputed that, by the time Poorman arrived, Plaintiff had already been handcuffed by\nanother officer and was on the ground inside the outer fence of the prison. (/d. at 5-6) The\nclearly established right at issue is not the use of excessive force during an escape attempt, but\nrather the use of excessive force once an inmate has been restrained.\n\nStriking a physically restrained and nonthreatening inmate is clearly unlawful under the\nprecedent of the Third Circuit and sister circuits. See, e.g., Giles, 571 F.3d at 326 (\u201c[A]t the time\nof the incident in 2001, it was established that an officer may not kick or otherwise use gratuitous\nforce against an inmate who has been subdued.\u201d); Cowart v. Erwin, 837 F.3d 444, 454 (Sth Cir.\n2016) (\u201cWe have little difficulty concluding that in 2009, the time of the incident, it was well-\nestablished, in sufficiently similar situations, that officers may not \u2018use gratuitous force against a\nprisoner who has already been subdued[.]\u2019\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is generally recognized that \u2018it is a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment for prison officials to use mace, tear gas or other chemical\n\nagents in quantities greater than necessary or for the sole purpose of infliction of pain.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a7 In reaching this conclusion, the court does not mean to suggest that the factfinder must\nultimately side with Plaintiff. This analysis is confined to the application of the summary\njudgment standard under Rule 56, which requires the court to view the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party.\n\n12\nWilliams v. Benjamin, 77 F.3d 756, 763 (4th Cir. 1996) (quoting Soto v. Dickey, 744 F.2d 1260,\n1270 (7th Cir. 1984)); see also Robinson v. Danberg, 673 F. App\u2019x 205, 212 (3d Cir. 2016)\n(finding sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that officer\u2019s use of mace on\nan inmate in his cell amounted to an excessive use of force). Viewing the evidence under the\nrequired deferential standard in favor of Plaintiff, a reasonable factfinder could find that Plaintiff\nwas subdued and unresisting when Poorman allegedly beat him and caused him to be sprayed\nwith pepper spray, and any reasonable officer would have known that this conduct is unlawful.\nThe reasonableness of Poorman\u2019s actions will require an assessment of witness credibility at\ntrial, and it would be premature to resolve the matter on summary judgment. Therefore,\nPoorman is not entitled to qualified immunity, and his motion for summary judgment on\nPlaintiff's constitutional claim is denied.\n3. Supervisory liability of Esposito\n\nIndividual liability predicated on a defendant\u2019s supervisory role requires a showing that\nthe supervisor-defendant had personal involvement in the alleged constitutional violation, and\n\u201cliability cannot be predicated solely on the operation of respondeat superior[.]\u201d Thomas v. Bd.\nof Educ. of Brandywine Sch. Dist., 759 F. Supp. 2d 477, 495 (D. Del. 2010) (quoting Rode v.\nDellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1998)). Here, Defendants argue that the evidence\ndoes not support Plaintiff's claim for supervisory liability against Esposito, and allegations that\nEsposito witnessed Poorman pushing Plaintiff\u2019s face into the fence are insufficient to show that\nEsposito participated in a violation of Plaintiff's constitutional rights. (D.I. 51 at 7-8)\n\nFor the reasons set forth at \u00a7 III.C, infra, Plaintiff did not exhaust his administrative\nremedies as to Esposito. Consequently, the court does not reach the substance of Defendants\u2019\n\nsummary judgment position regarding Esposito\u2019s supervisory liability.\n\n13\nB. Delaware Tort Claims Act\n\nDefendants further argue that Poorman is entitled to statutory immunity on Plaintiff's\nstate law claims of assault, battery, and infliction of emotional distress under the Delaware Tort\nClaims Act (\u201cDTCA\u201d), 10 Del. C. \u00a7 4001 et seg. The DTCA provides immunity for state\nofficials acting in their individual capacity if \u201c(1) [t]he act or omission complained of arose out\nof and in connection with the performance of an official duty requiring a determination of policy,\nthe interpretation or enforcement of statutes, rules or regulations . . . or any other official duty\ninvolving the exercise of discretion . . . ; (2) [t]he act or omission complained of was done in\ngood faith and in the belief that the public interest would be best served thereby; and (3) [t]he act\nor omission complained of was done without gross or wanton negligence.\u201d Jd. Under the\nDTCA, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the absence of one or more of the elements. /d. at\n\u00a7 4001.\n\nA genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Poorman acted in good faith or\nwithout gross or wanton negligence. Like an excessive force claim, both the second and third\nelements of the statutory immunity defense require an inquiry into the subjective intent of the\nofficer. See Wiers v. Barnes, 925 F. Supp. 1079, 1092 (D. Del. 1996) (denying both qualified\nimmunity and DTCA immunity where the officer\u2019s subjective intent presented a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact). These elements \u201cdo not readily lend themselves to resolution by summary\njudgment.\u201d Jd; see also Barrett v. McDonald, C.A. No. 14-742-LPS, 2015 WL 5679732, at *18\n(D. Del. Sept. 25, 2015) (citing Eustice v. Rupert, 460 A.2d 507, 509 (Del. 1983)) (\u201cGenerally,\nthe issue of whether facts and circumstances amount to willful conduct or gross negligence is a\n\nquestion for the finder of fact.\u201d).\n\n14\nThe facts alleged against Poorman could support a finding of bad faith or gross\nnegligence because they plausibly suggest that Poorman used force on Plaintiff multiple times\nwhen Plaintiff was visibly injured, restrained in handcuffs, and surrounded by multiple officers.\n(D.I. 52 at Jf 4-6, 11-12; D.I. 53 at JA028, 096, 183-85, 262-63) Construing this record in the\nlight most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Poorman acted with\ngross or wanton negligence or bad faith because Poorman\u2019s alleged conduct, as described in\nmore detail at \u00a7 III.A.1, supra, \u201crepresent[s] an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of\ncare.\u201d Browne v. Robb, 583 A.2d 949, 953 (Del. 1990). Therefore, Defendants\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment as to the state law claims against Poorman is denied.\n\nC. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\nPlaintiff's excessive force claim against Esposito is procedurally defective because\nPlaintiff failed to first exhaust his administrative remedies as required under the Prison Litigation\nReform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. The PLRA requires that prisoners exhaust available\nadministrative remedies before bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). \u201cRequiring\nexhaustion allows prison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes concerning the exercise of\ntheir responsibilities before being haled into court.\u201d Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 204 (2007).\nThe applicable procedural rules that a prisoner must exhaust \u201care defined not by the PLRA, but\nby the prison grievance process itself.\u201d Jd. at 200.\n\nThere is no dispute that Plaintiff did not name Esposito in his grievance against Poorman.\n(D.I. 16 at 1; Ex. A) The Supreme Court has held that \u201cexhaustion is not per se inadequate\nsimply because an individual later sued was not named in the grievances.\u201d Jones, 549 U.S. at\n219. Instead, the Supreme Court determined that the lower courts should determine the\n\nsufficiency of exhaustion when a defendant is not named in a grievance. Jd. When a grievance\n\n15\nprocedure solicits information regarding the identity of individuals involved in the incident, the\nThird Circuit has indicated that the grievant should provide identifying information, and a failure\nto do so may result in dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. See Spruill v.\nGillis, 372 F.3d 218, 234 (3d Cir. 2004); see also Miller v. Taylor, No. 08-CV-271, 2011 WL\n1045564, at *5 (D. Del. Mar. 15, 2011) (explaining that the exhaustion requirement was not\nsatisfied as to a supervisory liability claim where \u201cthe grievance [did] not make any mention of\nany problem with the conduct of the supervising lieutenant . . . either by name or by position\u201d).\n\nHere, the grievance form completed by Plaintiff in November 2017 instructed him to\n\u201c[b]riefly state the reason for this grievance. Give dates and names of others involved in the\nincident or any witnesses.\u201d (D.I. 16, Ex. A at DEF000017) Plaintiff identified Poorman by\nname on the grievance form, but he did not identify Esposito. (/d.) The undisputed facts,\nincluding Plaintiff's own testimony, establish that Plaintiff knew Esposito and was able to\nidentify him during the incident when Poorman allegedly slammed him against the fence. (D.I.\n52 at \u00a5 9; D.I. 53 at JA107:15-23, 151:1-7) Nonetheless, Plaintiffs only explanation for\nEsposito\u2019s omission is that Esposito was not \u201cthe main person involved.\u201d (D.I. 53 at JA107:24-\n109:1) The undisputed facts and evidence confirm that Plaintiff could have included Esposito in\nthe grievance, and his decision to omit Esposito amounts to a failure to exhaust the available\nadministrative remedies for his claim against Esposito.\n\nPlaintiff argues that he was not required to file a grievance against Esposito because\n\n\u201cDOC has no grievance procedure for complaints about security staff[.]\u201d\u2019 (D.I. 57 at \u00a72) This\n\n7 Plaintiff s argument rests on his experience in submitting a grievance against Poorman that was\nreturned unprocessed. The record confirms that Plaintiff's grievance against Poorman was\nreturned to him as unprocessed because it was a request for the investigation into the actions of\nstaff members, and \u201c[r]equests are not processed through the grievance procedure. Please\ncorrespond with the appropriate officer to secure the information requested.\u201d (D.I. 16, Ex. A at\n\n16\nis not supported by the language of Delaware Department of Correction Policy Number 4.4 (the\n\u201cInmate Grievance Policy\u201d), which broadly defines a \u201cgrievance\u201d as \u201c[a] written complaint\nconceming ... any act or omission attributable to staff, vendors, volunteers, or other inmates\naffecting an inmate and any condition or incident within the institution that affects the grievant.\u201d\n(D1. 16, Ex. B at DEF000002) Paragraph 3a of the Inmate Grievance Policy provides a separate\nprocedure for requests to investigate the actions of security staff. (id. at DEF000003) This\nprocedure is described within the Inmate Grievance Policy, and it is not included in the\nparagraph addressing \u201c[p]olicies that have their own formal appeal mechanisms [and] are not\ngrievable under this policy.\u201d (/d.) Thus, the evidence of record indicates that both grievances\nand written requests for staff investigations are governed by the Inmate Grievance Policy.\n\nThere is no dispute as to the existence of the Inmate Grievance Policy,* nor is there a\ndispute that Plaintiff did not file a grievance or a written request regarding Esposito\u2019s conduct, as\nrequired by the Inmate Grievance Policy. Plaintiff's complaints about the implementation and\neffectiveness of the Inmate Grievance Policy do not excuse his failure submit a grievance or\n\nwritten request regarding Esposito\u2019s conduct in the first instance.? Consequently, Defendants\u2019\n\nDEF000018) The procedure identified in the return of Plaintiffs grievance corresponds with the\nprocedure for submitting written requests at {3a of the Inmate Grievance Policy. (/d., Ex. B at\nDEF000003) Plaintiffs returned grievance indicated that a copy of his grievance would be sent\non his behalf to his Unit Commander and the area supervisor in accordance with that procedure.\n(d., Ex. A at DEF000019) Regardless of the semantics, the Inmate Grievance Policy governs\nsubmission of both grievances and written requests for staff investigations, and there is no\ndispute that Plaintiff submitted neither a grievance nor a written request with respect to Esposito.\n8 Plaintiff challenges the applicability of the Inmate Grievance Policy to his circumstances, not\nthe existence of the Inmate Grievance Policy itself. (D.I. 57 at 3) But Plaintiff does not\nprovide sufficient evidence to suggest that no grievance policy governs his complaint about\nEsposito\u2019s conduct.\n\n9 In a July 22, 2020 Memorandum Order on Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the court concluded\nthat \u201cissues of procedural default and futility are ones that need factual development,\u201d and\ndirected the parties to conduct discovery on the issue of exhaustion on that basis. (D.I. 7 at 7)\nYet Plaintiff cites no new evidence in the sur-reply brief. (D.I. 57) Instead, Plaintiff refers back\n\n17\nmotion for summary judgment is granted with respect to Esposito.!\u00b0 See Green v. Poorman,\nC.A. No. 20-85-RGA, 2020 WL 4201854, at *2 (D. Del. July 22, 2020) (concluding that the\nissue of exhaustion is for the court to decide, and \u201ca plaintiff's failure to exhaust all\nadministrative remedies is an insuperable barrier to recovery.\u201d).\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is GRANTED-IN-\n\nPART. (D.I. 50) Specifically, the motion is GRANTED with respect to Esposito and DENIED\n\nwith respect to Poorman. An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nDated: February 17, 2022\n\nto his opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, which addressed exhaustion more broadly\nagainst both Defendants. (/d.) Indeed, Plaintiff's responsive brief to the motion to dismiss\nfocuses primarily on the sufficiency of the grievance Plaintiff submitted against Poorman. (D.I.\n4) Defendants have since dropped their exhaustion arguments with respect to Poorman. (D.I.\n16)\n\n\u20180 Plaintiff's failure to submit a grievance regarding Esposito\u2019s involvement cannot be cured at\nthis stage. First, the Inmate Grievance Policy specifies that \u201c[i]nmates are prohibited from\nsubmitting more than one grievance arising from the same incident.\u201d (D.I. 16, Ex. B at \u00a7 11)\nThe record establishes that Plaintiff already submitted a grievance regarding this incident, and\nthe grievance included no mention of Esposito. (/d., Ex. A) Second, any grievance against\nEsposito is now time-barred because grievances must be submitted \u201cwithin 7 calendar days of\nthe incident.\u201d (D.I. 16, Ex. B at DEF000005)\n\n18\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nCARY GREEN\nPlaintiff,\nCivil Action No. 20-85-SRF\n\nVv.\n\nPHILLIP POORMAN, LT.
