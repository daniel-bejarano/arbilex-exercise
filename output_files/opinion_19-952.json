That is, the fundamental dispute is whether the baseband signals that \nget packetized were previously translated.  2 4. \u201crouting and switching . . . via the at least one digital access unit\u201d means \n\u201crouting and switching . . . through the at least one digital access unit\u201d   \n(\u2019338 Patent, claim 1)  \nThe Court carefully reviewed all submissions in connection with the parties \u2019 contentions \nregarding the disputed claim terms  (see D.I. 305, 306, 307, 310, 311, 312, 313 &  316) , heard oral \nargument  (see D.I. 318 & 320)  and applied the following legal standards in reaching its decision:  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n135 S. Ct. 831, 837- 38 (2015).  \u201c [T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill \nin the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.\u201d   Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  Although \u201c the claims themselves provide substantial \nguidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms, \u201d the context of the surrounding words of the \nclaim also must be considered.  Id.  at 1314.  \u201c [T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d   Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201c is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d   Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, \nInc., 90 F .3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201c the specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess.  In such cases, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs. \u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201c Even when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of \nthe patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to 3 limit the claim scope using word s or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d   Hill- Rom \nServs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201c should also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d   Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff \u2019d, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201c intrinsic evidence, \n. . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and Trademark \nOffice] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\u201d   Phillips , 415 F.3d \nat 1317. \u201c [T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by \ndemonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.\u201d  Id. \nIn some cases, courts \u201c will need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period. \u201d  Teva , 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \u201c consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d   Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201c to ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical \naspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pe rtinent field. \u201d  \nPhillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201c expert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer \nfrom bias that is not present in intrinsic evidence. \u201d  Id.  Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201c may 4 be useful to the court,\u201d  it is \u201cless reliable \u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201c is unlikely \nto result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the  context of the \nintrinsic evidence. \u201d  Id. at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof the patented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. \nv. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nII. THE COURT \u2019S RULING  \nThe Court \u2019s ruling regarding the disputed claim term s of the  \u2019338 Patent  was announced \nfrom the bench at the conclusion of the hearing as follows:   \nThis is our second round of claim construction.  I previously \nconstrued a number of disputed terms of three  patents.[2]  Now we \nhave another four disputes on one of those  patents \u2013 disputes that \narose during the summary judgment  briefing.  I am prepared to rule \non the disputes.  As with  my prior ruling, I will not be issuing a \nwritten opinion, but I will issue an order stat ing my rulings.  I want \nto emphasize before I announce my decisions that although I am  not \nissuing a written opinion, we have followed a full and thorough \nprocess before making the decisions I am about to state.  I have \nreviewed the patent in dispute anew.   I have  also reviewed the \nmaterials submitted with the summary  judgment motions and the \nsupplemental claim construction  submissions.  We had some \n \n2  The Court  previously construed the terms \u201cdownlink signals\u201d  and \u201cdownlink channel \nsignals\u201d during the original claim construction proceedings, when there were three patents \nat issue \u2013 i.e., the \u2019338 Patent at is sue here today, as well as two other unrelated patents \n(the \u2019178 and \u2019314 Patents).  ( See D.I. 122).  The parties agreed that whatever meaning was \ngiven to these terms applied across the three patents , even though the patents did not share \na specification .  The Court construed those  terms according to their plain meaning, which \nwas \u201csignals transmitted in the downlink direction\u201d without necessarily being limited to \nradiofrequency (RF) signals.  ( Id. at 1; see also id. at 8-9).  Dali argues that that construction \nis dispositive of the issues raised in these supplemental proceedings.  ( See D.I. 305 at 9- 13 \n& 16- 19).  The Court disagrees.  Construction of these \u201cdownlink\u201d terms does not  resolve \nthe parties\u2019 dispute over the meaning of \u201cas appropriate\u201d in the \u201ctranslating\u201d step, nor does \nit resolve the disputes over  the related processing steps of claim 1.   In any event, claim \nconstruction is rolling and it is within the Court\u2019s discretion to clarify and revise claim constructions a t any point before the case goes to the jury.  See Jack Guttman, Inc. v. \nKopykake Enterprises, Inc. , 302 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also Pressure Prod. \nMed. Supplies, Inc. v. Greatbatch Ltd., 599 F.3d 1308, 1315- 16 (Fed. Cir. 2010); CytoLogix \nCorp. v. Ventana Med. Sys., Inc., 424 F.3d 1168, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2005) . 5 argument last week and there has  been argument here today.  All of \nthat has been carefully  considered . \n \nNow as to my rulings.  As an initial matter, I  am not going \nto read into the record my understanding of  claim construction law \ngenerally.   I have a legal standard  section that I have included in \nearlier opinions, including my prior opinion in this case.  I \nincorporate that law and adopt it into my ruling today and will also \nset it out in  the order that I issue.  \n The parties have proposed similar, though not  identical, \nproposals for the definition of a person of  ordinary skill in the art.\n[3]  \nNeither party has argued that  the differences in the proposals are \nrelevant to the issues  before me today.  \n The first term is \u201c translating the uplink and downlink signals \nbetween RF and base band as  appropriate \u201d which appears in claim  1 \nof the \u2019338 Patent.  Immediately after that term, claim 1 recites \n\u201cpacketizing  the uplink and downlink base band signals, wherein the  \npacketized signals correspond to a plurality of carriers.\u201d  That is the second disputed term here.   I think it makes  sense to address these \ntwo terms together.  \n The parties dispute whether the \u201c translating \u201d step is \nconditional.  As I understand the argument as  refined through last \nweek \u2019s discussion and today, Dali \u2019s position is that if the signal is \nat the DAU already in  baseband format, then it does not need to be \ntranslated  again to then be packetized.  And if the signal is at the  \nDAU in RF, then it does need to be translated to baseband before \npacketizing.  If at the RRU the signal is in  baseband, it also must be \ntranslated to RF before traveling  in the downlink direction towards \na mobile phone.  \n Essentially, as Dali sees it, \u201c [t]he point is  simply that at some \npoint in the system certain signals  going in a downlink direction will \nneed to be translated  before R[F] and baseband and at other points \nin the system  they will need to be translated between RF and \n \n3  During the original claim construction proceedings, Plaintiff\u2019s expert, Dr. Bims, opined that \u201ca person of ordinary skill in the  art in the field of these patents would have had a \nbachelor\u2019s in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, or their equivalent, and at least three years\u2019 experience working with wireless technology.\u201d   (D.I. \n105 at A082).  Defendant s\u2019 expert, Dr. Acampora, opined that a person of skill in the art \n\u201cwould have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Electrical Engineering or equivalent field of study, with 2 -3 years of work experience in the field of wireless communications.\u201d   (Id. at A0394 ).  \nNeither si de submitted anything different for these supplemental proceedings. 6 baseband in the uplink direction.\u201d[4]  As such, the \u201c uplink and \ndownlink signals \u201d in the \u201ctranslating \u201d step can  really be in either RF  \nformat or baseband format and the translation can happen at  the \nDAU or RRU as necessary.  The conditional nature of the  limitation \nis not so much that the \u201c translating \u201d step can be skipped altogether, \nbut rather that the requisite \u201c translating \u201d step sometimes occurs at \nthe DAU and sometime s at the RRU depending on where the signal \nis received and in  what format.  This is the concept captured by the \n\u201cas appropriate \u201d language in Dali \u2019s view.  \n \nCommScope disagrees.  CommScope argues that  Dali\u2019s \nposition does not make sense in the context of the  claim.  In \nparticular, because the next step \u2013 i.e., \u201cpacketizing the uplink and \ndownlink base band signals \u201d \u2013 builds off the \u201c translating \u201d step, \ntranslation at the RRU  would not flow through the remainder of the \nclaim.  That is,  there would not be any \u201c downlink base band signals \u201d \ncreated  from translation of downlink RF signals at the RRU because  \nthe RRU is configured to \u201c transmit downlink RF signals,\u201d  which \neveryone seem ed to agree last week means transmission  from RRU \nto mobile phone in the context of claim 1.  So in the context of the \nclaim, the RRUs would never be required  to translate downlink RF \nsignals to downlink baseband signals to then be packetized, routed \nand s witched.   CommScope \u2019s position is largely premised upon a \nfinding that  \u201cthe uplink and downlink base band signals \u201d that are  \npacketized in the \u201cpacketizing \u201d step are the particular  baseband  \nsignals created from RF signals in the prior  \u201ctranslating \u201d step.  In \nCommScope \u2019s view, the \u201c as appropriate \u201d language in the \n\u201ctranslating\u201d  step just refers  to the amount of translation necessary \n\u2013 how much or how  little you need to translate to get to the desired \nformat  for packetizing, et cetera.  \n \nHere, I agree with CommScope.  Starting with the  claim \nlanguage itself, the \u201cpacketizing \u201d step recites  \u201cpacketizing the \nuplink and downlink base band signals.\u201d  A  person of ordinary skill \nreading this language wo uld understand the article \u201c the\u201d applies to \nboth uplink and downlink signals, i.e. , the term is understood as  \n\u201cpacketizing the uplink base band signals and the downlink base \nband signals.\u201d  There is only one other reference to  \u201cbase band \u201d in \nall of claim 1 and it is in the \u201c translating \u201d step that immediately \nprecedes the \u201c packetizing \u201d step.  And that step requires translating \nbetween RF and baseband.  A person of ordinary skill would \ntherefo re understand \u201cthe uplink and downlink base band signals \u201d \nto be those baseband signals produced by  the prior \u201c translating \u201d \nstep.  So although Dali argues that the baseband signal in the  \n \n4  (D.I. 318 at 41:24- 42:4).  7 \u201cpacketizing \u201d step can be any baseband signal without first  having \nbeen translated, the claim language requires  otherwise.  Use of the \narticle \u201cthe\u201d indicates the downlink baseband signal is one that finds \nantecedent basis earlier  in the claim \u2013 where baseband signals are \ncreated from  translation of RF signals . \n \nI think this conclusion is the one that most  naturally aligns \nwith the specification.  One of the stated  objects of the present \ninvention is \u201c to facilitate  conversion and transport of several \ndiscrete relatively  narrow RF bandwidths.\u201d[5]  RF bandwidths \nrequire conversion to baseband first before transport, which occurs \nin packetized  form.  So requiring a translation from RF to baseband \nmakes  sense in the context of one of the objects of the present  \ninvention.[6]  The specification also states that \u201c [f]or the  downlink \n(DL) path, RF signals received from the [base  station] are separately \ndown- converted, digitized, and converted to base band (using a \nDigital Down -Converter).  Data streams are then I/Q mapped and \nframed.  Specific parallel data streams are then independently \nserialized and  translated to optical signals using plu ggable SFP \nmodules, and delivered to different RRUs over optical fiber \ncable. \u201d[7]  Again, this sugges ts that if a downlink signal is in RF  \nformat, it must be translated to baseband before transport.  A person \nof ordinary skill would understand that, in the  context of the \ninvention, translation of signals from RF to baseband is an integral \npart of the claimed method because that is what facilitates the \ntransport . \n So when the \u201c packetizing \u201d step refers to \u201c the uplink and \ndownlink base  band signals,\u201d  I think a person of ordinary skill would \nunderstand the term to be referring to those baseband signals tha t \nwere created by transla tion.  And as for the meaning of \u201cas \nappropriate \u201d in the \u201c translating \u201d step, it seems like that gets at the \namount of translation necessary to yield a baseband signal ready for \n \n5  (\u2019338 Patent at 4:20- 22; see also id. at 5:5-6 (\u201c[T]he present  invention facilitates conversion \nand transport of several discrete relatively narrow RF bandwidths.\u201d) ). \n6  Although neither side argues that it is limiting , the preamble similarly suggests that the \ninvention is about facilitating the transport of RF signals.  ( See \u2019338 Patent at Claim 1 (\u201cA \nmethod for routing and switching RF signals comprising . . . .\u201d (preamble)) ). \n7  (\u2019338 Patent  at 5:64- 6:4; see also id . at 6:4 -9 (uplink path)  & 8:24- 32 (\u201c[T]he system and \nmethod of the present invention readily supports configurations where one or more of the carriers which are part of base station signals 107 and 108 and are identical frequencies, since the base station signals are digitized, pa cketized, routed and switched to the desired \nRRU.\u201d) ). 8 packetization \u2013 not that the translation can occur at various places in \nthe system depending on what type of signal is at issue. \n \nI also don\u2019t think t hat the claim  differentiation argument that \nDali is making changes the  analysis.  Those claims are not simply \nadding a source of  the signal as Dali suggests.  Claims 6 and 7 add \nmultiple  limitations to claim 1 \u2013 for example, claim 6 adds that  there \nare two DAUs rather than one or more in claim 1 and that there are \ntwo base stations.  Claim 7 adds that each  base station transmits or \nreceives RF signals  from multiple  carriers . \n As to Dali \u2019s argument that translation can also  occur at the \nRRU, I don\u2019 t think that is excluded by the  claim.   Nor is a scenario \nwhere signals already in baseband  (i.e., without needing translation) \nget packetized, routed  and switched.  The claim is a comprising \nclaim and those  situations are not excluded  by the construction \ntoday.  But when it comes to what is required  by the claim, I find \nthat a person of ordinary skil l would understand that claim 1 does \nrequire translation of uplink and downlink RF signals  to baseband, \nwhere the resulting baseband signals then get  packetized, routed and \nswitched.   I am also unpersuaded by Dali\u2019s argument that \u201c uplink \nand downlink signa ls\u201d are so  well-known that there is an inherent \nantecedent basis such  that any person of ordinary skill would know \nwhat these terms mean.   I disagree that the statements by \nCommScope \u2019s expert and attorneys during the IPR make clear that \nthere is  an inherent antecedent basis.   It appears that those  statements \nwere interpreting the claim as Dali had in  connection with its \ninfringement contentions in this case.  And as I read those \nstatements, they are asserting that a particular piece of prior art \ndisclosed or inherently  disclosed the translation from RF to \nbaseband, not that what  was packetized was not a translated signal.   \nI also note the  testimony of Dali\u2019 s own expert who testified that \nthere is  no antecedent basis for \u201c the uplink and downlink base band \nsignals.\u201d\n[8] \n The next term at issue goes along with the  previous two.  The \nclaim term is \u201c routing and switching the  packetized signals among \nthe one or more remote radio units  via the at least one digital access \nunit,\u201d  which also  appears in claim 1 of the \u2019 338 Patent.  The dispute \nhere is  whether the term \u201c the packetized signals \u201d refers to the \nparticular uplink and downlink baseband signals that were  produced \nby the prior packetizing step.  Although Dali \u2019s expert seemingly \n \n8  (See D.I. 252, Ex. 3 at 106: 16-20 (\u201cQ. Is there an antecedent basis in the claim for the \nphrase \u2018the uplink and downlink baseband signals in the packetizing step\u2019 as a yes -or-no \nquestion.  A. No.\u201d)).  9 agreed w ith that premise,[9] Dali now resists  it for two reasons.  First, \nDali does not believe that  CommScope \u2019s proposed chain of \nantecedent bases is proper \u2013 i.e., that the routed and switched \npacketized signals  recited here are packetized uplink and downlink \nbaseband signals that were made in the \u201c packetizing \u201d step from \nuplink and downlink baseband signals, the baseband signals having \nbeen made in the \u201c translating \u201d step before that.  That is, Dali takes \nissue with the packetized signal being one that  must have been \ntranslated previously in the \u201c translating \u201d step.  I have already \nrejected Dali \u2019s argument.  Dali also  now argues that a person of \nordinary skill would know that  only packetized signals in the \ndownlink direction are routed and switched.[10]  As to this latter \nargument, I don\u2019 t think  that there is support for this position in the  \nspecification, and Dali \u2019s argument is undermined by the  language of \nthe claim.  \u201cThe packetized signals \u201d refers back  to \u201cthe packetized \nsigna ls\u201d that were produced by the  \u201cpacketizing \u201d step, a step where \nboth uplink and downlink baseband signals were packetized.  So \n\u201cthe packetized  signals \u201d that are recited in both the \u201c packetizing \u201d \nstep and  the \u201crouting and switching\u201d  step are both uplink and  \ndownlink baseband signals.  This is how a person of ordinary skill \nwould understand \u201c the packetized signals \u201d in the  context of the \nrelated processing steps.  I see no basis for  a person of ordinary skill \nto know that the uplink ba seband  signals are just not a part of that \nand not routed and  switched.  It may be that there is little sense in \nrouting and switching packetized uplink baseband signals, but that  \nis not my concern when the claim language is clear .[11] \n \nIn sum, I think tha t a person of ordinary skill  would \nunderstand that \u201c the packetized signals \u201d that are  routed and \nswitched in this step are \u201c the packetized  signals \u201d that \u201ccorrespond \nto a plurality of carriers \u201d that were created by packetizing \u201cthe \nuplink and downlink base  band signals.\u201d   And this means that \u201c the \n \n9  (See id.  at 107:21- 108:2 (\u201cQ.

That step requires \u201c routing and switching the packetized \nsignals . . . via the at least one  digital access unit \u201d and the parties \ndispute the meaning of  \u201cvia.\u201d  Dali argues that the plain meaning of \n\u201cvia\u201d in context is \u201c through the agency of/by means of, \u201d though \ntoday during the argument Dali agreed that \u201c through\u201d  is an  \nappropriate construction.  CommScope argues tha t \u201cvia\u201d means  the \ndigital access unit (or units) must perform the  switching.  The crux \nof the dispute is thus whether the  digital access unit must physically \ndo the switching of  packetized signals, as CommScope argues, or \nwhether another  component may perf orm the switching as long as it \noccurs  through or through the agency of the digital access unit, as  \nDali suggest s. \n Here, I think the correct construction is  \u201cthrough.\u201d  The plain \nmeaning of \u201c via\u201d is \u201cthrough\u201d  and, as  such, a person of ordinary \nskill reading this term would understand that the packetized signals \nmust pass through the  \u201cat least one digital access unit \u201d in the routing \nand switching step.  As to CommScope \u2019s proposal, nothing in the  \nclaim language requires that the \u201c at least one digital access unit \u201d \nactually make the decisions as to where the packetized signals are \ngoing among the remote radio units.  And nothing in the \nspecification limits the claim in this  way either.  Although \nCommScope makes much of the fact that  prior art employed \nnetw ork switches to do the switching \u2013 something that the \nspecification criticized \u2013 I am ultimately unpersuaded that the claim \nis so limited that it requires the digital access unit to decide the \nroutes each  packet must take and perform the switching all on its \nown.  The same is true for the amendment made during prosecution.   \nA change in claim language from \u201c among . . . radio units and the at \nleast one digital access units \u201d to \u201camong . . . remote radio units via \nthe at least one digital access unit\u201d  does not indicate to a person of \nordinary skill that the patentee  clearly and unmistakably surrendered \nembodiments where the  DAU is not itself making and performing \nthe routing and switching decisions . \n \n \n               \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge  "}
