(D.I. 10).  It has been fully briefed.  (D.I. 11, 16, \n18).  The parties have resolved a significant portion of the motion by stipulation.  (D.I. 12). \n T wo issues remain \u2014section 101 challenges to two of the four asserted patents.  \n One of the challenged patents is the \u2018369 patent asserted in Count I.  Claim 15 is said to be representative.  I do not need to consider its representativeness, because (at the motion to dismiss stage) I am not convinced that Claim 15 is  claiming patent- ineligible subject matter.  It \nclaims an apparatus that performs diagnostic test ing on idle traces , and it seems sufficiently \nspecific that I do not think I can say it is claiming an abstract idea.  I express no opinion on whether it has an inventive concept.      The second challenged patent is the \u2018485 patent asserted in Count II.\n1  Claim 16 is said to \nbe representative.  It reads:  \n16. Apparatus for measuring latency in a network in which traffic is transmitted in a \nplurality of classes of service, the apparatus comprising a node in the network, which \ngenerates a latency measurement  packet containing an indication that the packet belongs \nto a selected one of the classes of service and to transmit the latency measurement packet, \n \n1 Defendant s\u2019 briefs argue the \u2018485 patent first and the \u2018369 patent second.  (D.I. 11, D.I. 18).  Plaintiff\u2019s brief \nreverses the order.  (D.I. 16).  I doubt that either side chose the order unintentional ly. Page 2 of 3 \n so that the packet is passed through the network at a level of service accorded to the class, \nthe node note s a time of receipt of the latency measurement packet at a destination in the \nnetwork and to calculate the latency for the selected one of the classes of service by \ntaking a difference between a time of transmission of the latency measurement packet \nand the time of receipt thereof . \n \nThe patent\u2019s Abstract is essentially the same, though described as a method: \n \nA method for measuring latency in a bi-directional ring network includes transmitting a \nlatency measurement packet from an originating node to a peer node and noting a time of \nreceipt of the packet at the peer node. The packet is then transmitted back to the \noriginating node in the opposite direction, while recording in the packet an indication of a \npeer node difference between a time of transmission of the packet from the peer node to \nthe originating node and the time of receipt of the packet at the peer node. A time of \nreturn of the packet to the originating node is noted, so as to determine an originating \nnode difference between a time of transmission of the packet from the originating node to \nthe peer node and the time of return of the packet to the originating node. The latency is \ncalculated by taking a difference between the originating node difference and the peer \nnode difference. \n \n In view of the above, I agree with Defendant s that this claim is patent- ineligible.  It \nclaims an abstract idea.  I would  characterize the abstract idea as measuring latency2 by \nsubtraction. I think that characterization is  apparent just from reading Claim 16.  I further think it \nis clear that there is no inventive concept.  Plaintiff\u2019s explanation  (D.I. 16 at 18) that the packet \n(called a latency measurement packet, or LMP) identifies a class of service  to which it belongs \nand reports results for that class does not constitute an inventive concept.  Classes of service \nwere already \u201ccommon\u201d at the t ime of the invention.  (\u2018485 patent, 1:56-63).  I do not think, \nhowever, that Claim 16 is necessarily representative of every claim of the patent .  I note for \nexample that Claim 9 , which is an independent method claim, consists of substantially more than \njust the subtraction that is at the heart of Claim 16.   \nThe motion to dismiss (D.I. 10 ) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  Claim 16 of \nthe \u2018485 patent is DISMISSED with prejudice. \n \n2 Latency  (or latency of transmission)  is how long it takes for a data packet t o reach a destination after it is sent.  \n\u2018485 Patent, 2:34-41.
