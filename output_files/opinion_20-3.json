No. 20-3- LPS \n \nMEMORANDUM  ORDER \nWHEREAS, Defendant Nylere Stanford pled guilty to one count of being a felon in \npossession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) ( see generally D.I. \n44); \nWHEREAS, on December 13, 2021, U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services  filed a final \npresentence investigation repo rt (D.I. 56) (\u201cPSR\u201d) ; \nWHEREAS, Stanford and the government submitted initial briefing on Stanford\u2019s \nobjections to the PSR  (see generally D.I. 57, 58, 60);  \nWHEREAS, on December 21, 2021, the Court conducted an evidentiary hearing and \nheard oral argument on Stanford\u2019s objections ( see generally D.I. 66) (\u201cTr.\u201d);  \nWHEREAS, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Court and the parties agreed that the \nCourt would receive supplemental briefing ( see id.  at 76-79); \nWHEREAS, the Court has carefully considered all the br iefing ( see generally D.I. 57, 58, \n60, 67, 70, 71, 74), as well as the evidence presented at the December 21 hearing and all the \narguments presented by the parties; \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that, for the reasons given below,  \n2 Stanford\u2019s objections to the PSR  are OVERRULED.  The sentencing guidelines applicable to \nStanford, and from which the Court will begin its analysis in determining an appropriate \nsentence, are as follows:  offense level of 21, criminal history category of III, and advisory \nguideline range of 46- 57 months. \n1. \u201cThe defense contends that the defendant\u2019s Robbery First Degree, Robbery \nSecond Degree, and Attempted Robbery adult convictions . . . do not meet the definition of a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u201d the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) .  (D.I. 58 at 2)  \nResolution of Stanford\u2019s  objections to the PSR requires consideration of Delaware\u2019s statutory \nprovisions governing the crimes of theft, second- degree robbery, and first -degree robbery .  The \nrelevant version of the Delaware theft statute provides  that \u201c[a] person is guilty of theft when the \nperson takes, exercises control over or obtains property of another person intending to deprive that person of it or appropriate it.\u201d  11 Del. C. \u00a7 841(a) (2008 ).\n1  Th is definition  of theft  is \nincorporated in Delaware\u2019s second -degree robbery statute: \n(a) A person is guilty of robbery in the second degree when, in the \ncourse of committing theft, the person uses or threatens the immediate use of force upon another person with in tent to: \n(1) Prevent or overcome resistance to the taking of property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or  \n(2) Compel the owner of the property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the com mission of the theft.  \nId. \u00a7 831 (2008).   In turn, Delaware\u2019s first -degree robbery statute starts with second -degree \n \n1 The relevant versions of the statute s are those that were in effect in August 2008, when \nStanford was convicted of the offenses that affect  his base offense level and criminal history \ncategory in the PSR .  (See D.I. 56 at 10) \n  \n3 robbery and includes additional elements: \n(a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when the \nperson commits the crime of robbery in the second degree and when, in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, the person or another participant in the crime:  \n(1) Causes physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; or  \n(2) Displays wh at appears to be a deadly weapon or represents \nby word or conduct that the person is in possession or control of a deadly weapon; or \n(3) Is armed with and uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or  \n(4) Commits said crime against a person who is 6 2 yea rs of age \nor older. \nId. \u00a7 832 (2008).  \nStanford argues that , under Delaware law,  first-degree and second- degree robbery do not \nrequire intentional conduct.  In his view ( see, e.g. , D.I. 67 at 1-3), Delaware\u2019s robbery statutes \nprohibit some reckless or negligent conduct, so Delaware robbery cannot qualify as a \u201ccrime of \nviolence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) .  See  generally Borden v. United States , 141 S. Ct. \n1817 (2021) (holding that criminal offense requiring only reckless mental st ate does not qualify \nas \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 934(e) ).  The Court does not agree that Delaware\u2019s \nrobbery statutes cover reckless or negligent conduct.  The theft statute (which is incorporated in \nthe robbery statutes ) require s that the defendant must have acted intentionally.  See 11 Del. C. \n\u00a7 841(a) (2008) (\u201cintending to deprive\u201d) .  The second-degree robbery statute also expressly \nrequires the defendant\u2019s intent.  See id.  \u00a7 831 (2008) (\u201cwith intent to . . . [p]revent or overcome \n. . . or . . . [c]ompel\u201d) .  The first -degree robbery statute incorporates all of the second -degree  \n4 robbery requirements, including its intent requirement , as well as the theft requirements, \nincluding its intent requirement.  See id.  \u00a7 832 (2008).2 \nConsistent with the Court\u2019s conclusions, t he Delaware Supreme Court has explained that \nfirst-degree and second- degree robbery \u201crequire proof of the same mental state,\u201d i.e., that \u201cthe \ndefendant acted intentionally.\u201d  Allen v. State , 970 A.2d 203, 211 & n.23 (Del. 2009) (en banc)  \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Zugehoer v. State , 980 A.2d 1007, 1010 (Del. 2009) \n(referring to \u201cintent\u201d element for theft under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 841).3  Further confirmation of this \npoint is found in the Delaware Superior Court\u2019s model jury instructions, which explicitly state \nthat robbery requires the defendant to have acted intentionally.  (D.I. 58-1 Ex. B)   Thus, the \nCourt rejects Stanford\u2019s argument under Borden  that th e Delaware robbery s tatute s are \noverbroad. \n \n2 Contrary to Stanford\u2019s contention, a more general statute in the Delaware criminal code \n\u2013 which provides a default mental -state requirement ( including recklessness ) when no mental-\nstate requirement is provided in the statute of conviction itself \u2013 does not apply here.  See 11 \nDel. C.  \u00a7 251.  Rather , 11 Del. C. \u00a7 252 appears to apply and fully supports the Court\u2019s \ninterpretation: \u201cWhen a statute defining an offense prescribes the state of mind that is sufficient \nfor the commission of the offense, without distinguishing among the elements thereof, the provision shall apply to all the elements of the offense, unless a contrary legislative purpose \nplainly appears.\u201d \n \n3 Stanford\u2019s reliance on Hackett v. State , 569 A.2d 79 (Del. 1990), is misplaced.  In that \ncase, the Delaware Supreme Court suggested that first -degree robbery does not require that \nphysical injury be inflicted intentionally.  See id.  at 80.  That discussion was in the context of a \ndouble- jeopard y analysis, and it does not imply that the overall crime of first -degree robbery \nmay be committed reckles sly.  See id.   Moreover, that  discussion was merely dicta because the \ncourt had already explained a more fundamental difference between  robbery and assault that was \nsufficient to reject the double- jeopardy challenge : robbery has an element of theft, while assault \ndoes not .  See id.   Later, i n an unpublished table decision, the Delaware Supreme Court \nrepeated th e reasoni ng from Hackett  to reject a similar double -jeopardy challenge .  See \nFedorkowicz v. State , 988 A.2d 937 (Del. 2010).  For similar reasons, Stanford\u2019s reliance on \nFedork owicz  is unpersuasive.  \n5 2. Stanford next argues that Delaware\u2019s first -degree robbery statute is  indivisible .  \n(See D.I. 67 at 3 & n.4)  Again, the Court disagrees .  A statute is divisible if it \u201ccomprises \nmultiple, alternative versions of the crime.\u201d  Descamps  v. United States , 570 U.S. 254, 262 \n(2013) ; see also Mathis v. United States , 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2249 (2016) (explaining that divisible \nstatutes \u201clist elements in the alternative, and thereby define multiple crimes \u201d).  Delaware\u2019s first -\ndegree robbery statute sets forth four alternative versions of the crime .  One of  those alternatives  \nrequires  the display of something that appears to be a deadly weapon.  See 11 Del. C. \u00a7 832 \n(2008) ; see also Word v. State , 801 A.2d 927, 930 (Del. 2002) (referring to disjunctive options in \n\u00a7 832 as \u201cadditional statutory element[s]\u201d) .  Although the Court has not been pointed to any \nThird Circuit case addressing the divisibility of Delaware\u2019s robbery statute, the Third Circuit has \nundertaken this analysis w ith respect to P ennsylvania\u2019s robbery statut e.  Like Delaware\u2019s \nstatute, Pennsylvania\u2019s statute has alternative elements  that are clearly laid out , and  the Third \nCircuit concluded the Pennsylvania statute  is \u201cobviously divisible.\u201d  United States v. Peppers , \n899 F.3d 211, 232 (3d Cir. 2018); see also United States v. McCants , 952 F.3d 416, 425-27 (3d \nCir. 2020).  On the same reasoning espoused by the Third Circuit in Peppers and McCants, the Court concludes that Delaware\u2019s first -degree robbery statute is divisible.  \n3. Stanfo rd then argues that , even if Delaware\u2019s  first-degree robbery statute is \ndivisible, there is no way to know which statutory provision he was convicted of violating.  ( See \nD.I. 67 at 3- 5)  Based on the documents the Court is permitted to consider, however, t he record \nis clear  that Stanford was convicted of first-degree robbery with a deadly weapon  under 11 Del. \nC. \u00a7 832(a)(2).  When a statute is divisible, courts employ a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d to \ndetermine whether a predicate offense qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d  Descamps , 570 U.S.  \n6 at 261.  The modified categorical approach permit s the Court to review certain documents , \nincluding the indictment and plea agreement , to understand which version of a crime the \ndefendant was convic ted of violating.  See i d.; see also Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, \n20-21 (2005) ( permitting review of plea agreements ).  Here, Count II  of the indictment allege s \nthat Stanford \u201cdisplayed what appeared to be a shotgun, a deadly weapon,\u201d which closely tracks \nthe language of \u00a7 832(a)(2).  (D.I. 58 -1 Ex. A at #360)  The plea agreement further shows that \nStanford pled guilty to that charge.  ( Id. at #357)   Stanford attempts to cast doubt on the facts \nunderlying th e charge by pointing out that he also pled guilty to second- degree robbery and \nattempted second -degree robbery, which were only  lesser -included offenses of Counts XIV and \nXVIII  in the indict ment .  (See id.  at #365-67; see also Tr. at 38 (\u201cSo the facts that were alleged \nwould have made him guilty of First Degree Robbery.  But what he pled to was Second Degree Robbery and Attempted Second Degree Robbery, which means the facts he pled to had to be different. .  . .  So there is no way to identify what he was guilty of.\u201d))   Considering all the \ndocuments the Court is permitted to consider, the Court is persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that Counts XIV and XVIII of the indictment were pled down to offens es not requiring \na deadly weapon .  This does not imply anything about Count II, which was a conviction for \nfirst-degree robbery with a deadly weapon under \u00a7 832(a)(2).  ( See Tr. at 60)  The disposition \nsheet for Stanford\u2019s case in Superior Court adds furth er corroboration, as it states that he was \nconvicted of \u201cDE11083200A2FB,\u201d which the Court understands to refer to Delaware Code, title \n11, section 832, subsection (a)(2), which is a Felony C lass B.  ( D.I. 70-2 at #594)\n4 \n \n4 Under the modified categorical approach, the Court may properly consider a judicial \ndocument such as the disposition sheet.  See Shepard, 544 U.S. at 26 (permitting review of \n  \n7 4. Stanford further contends that robbery under Delaware law  is not a crime of \nviolence.  ( See D.I. 67 at 5- 9)  The Sentencing Guidelines define \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to mean \nany of an enumerated list of offenses (including robbery) , as well as any other felony that \u201chas as \nan element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of \nanother.\u201d  U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).  Under the enumerated claus e in \u00a7  4B1.2(a)(2), Delaware \nrobbery qualifies as a crime of violence if \u201cthe statut ory definition . . . substantially corresponds \nto the generic definition \u201d of robbery, which is \u201cthe taking of property from another person or \nfrom the immediate presence of another person by force or by intimidation.\u201d   McCants , 952 \nF.3d at 428-29 (internal  quotation marks omitted).  The Third Circuit has explained that \n\u201cgeneric robbery requires no more than de minimis  force.\u201d  United States v. Graves , 877 F.3d \n494, 503 (3d Cir. 2017) .  Here, the Delaware robbery statutes \u201csubstantially correspond\u201d to \ngeneri c robbery.  Delaware\u2019s second -degree robbery statute requires that the defendant \u201cuse[] or \nthreaten[] the immediate use of force upon another person\u201d while committing theft.  11 Del. C. \u00a7 831(a) (2008 ).  This requirement of more than de minimis  force is incorporated into the first-\ndegree robbery statute.  See id.  \u00a7 832 (2008) .  Because first-degree and second -degree robbery \nin Delaware are not broader than generic robbery, they qualify as crimes of violence under the \n \n\u201ccomparable judicial record[s]\u201d); United States v. Henderson, 841 F.3d 623, 632 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(explaining that \u201creliable judicial r ecords\u201d include docket entries).   The Court has no reason to \ndoubt the reliability of the disposition sheet, which is a \u201crecord[] of the convicting court.\u201d  \nShepard, 544 U.S. at 23.  The Court is not persuaded that the disposition sheet should be \ndisregarded on the basis that it is too prone to errors that are likely to  go unnoticed.  ( See D.I. 71 \nat 5-6) (citing Mathis , 136 S. Ct. at 2253)   In Mathis , the U.S. Supreme Court was concerned \nabout statements of \u201cnon -elemental fact\u201d prejudicing defendants because \u201ctheir proof is \nunnecessary.\u201d  See 136 S. Ct. at 2253.  Here, the statement at issue is the fact of the conviction \nitself , including its essential elements, which must be proven (by evidence and/or agreement) in \norder for a plea to be accepted.   In any event, the Court would reach the same conclusion here \neven if the government had not introduced the disposition sheet.  \n8 enumerated clause.  See Grav es, 877 F.3d at 504 (holding that common law robbery under \nNorth Carolina law is crime of violence). \n5. The cases cited by Stanford for his contrary conclusion do not persuade the Court.  \nFor example, Stanford relies  on State v. Smallwood, 346 A.2d 164 (Del. 1975), for the \nproposition that \u201ca conviction for first degree robbery can occur based merely on a theft and the \nsubjective belief of the victim that the defendant was armed. \u201d  (D.I. 71 at 7-8)  That argument \nignores the other required elements to be convi cted of first -degree robbery based on \u201cdisplay,\u201d \nincluding \u201cuse[] or threaten[ed] . . . immediate use of force,\u201d 11 Del. C. \u00a7 831 (2008), as well as \u201can objective physical manifestation that the robber appears to be displaying a deadly weapon,\u201d Deshields v. State , 706 A.2d 502, 507 (Del. 1998).  For these required elements to be met, it is \nnecessary for a defendant to use more than de minimis force.  Stanford argues that Delaware robbery \u201ccan occur when an item is taken from a victim\u2019s grasp even if the victim is unaware of \nthe theft while it is happening  and thus offers no resistance.\u201d   (D.I. 67 at 7) (citing State v. \nDawson, 2004 WL 838858 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 12, 2004))   Dawson does not support this \nproposition, as the facts there in volved the defendant using force to  steal a purse from a 77 -year-\nold victim.  See 2004 WL 838858, at *1, 4.  Relatedly , Stanford argues that a person may be \nfound guilty of Delaware robbery \u201cif a victim believes someone has stolen something and that person, in the course of flight, unintentionally uses force to get away.\u201d  (D.I. 67 at 8) (emphasis omitted) (citing Bialach v. State , 744 A.2d 983 (Del. 2000))   But in Bialach the Delaware \nSupreme Court explained that a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cused force against another person with intent to overcome resistance to the taking of the property.\u201d  744 A.2d at 986 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).   \n9 Stanford \u2019s cases from other circuits , which hold that Massachusetts robbery  and Kansas robbery \nare not violent felonies , are not controlling and may conflict with the Third Circuit authorities \nrelied on by this Court.  ( See D.I. 67 at 8 (citing United States v. Parnell , 818 F.3d 974 (9th Cir. \n2016); King v. MacEachern, 665 F.3d 247, 253 (1st Cir. 2011)) ; see also  D.I. 74 (citing United \nStates v. Bong, 913 F.3d 1252 (10th Cir. 2019) ))  Those cases  involve the elements clause of the \n\u201cviolent felony\u201d provision in  the Armed Career Criminal Act  (\u201cACCA\u201d) , not the enumerated \nclause of the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) that is relevant here .  \nParnell  and King also issued  before the U.S. Supreme Court provided additional guidance about \nACCA\u2019s elements clause and held that Florida robbery involves sufficient violence for a \nsentencing penalty to apply.  See generally Stokeling v. United States , 139 S. Ct. 544 (2019).  \nMoreover, Parnell  and Bong relied on the fact that the defendant\u2019s m ere possession of a firearm , \neven without the victim\u2019s  awareness of that fact , is enough to support a conviction of either \narmed robbery under Massachusetts law or aggravated robbery under Kansas law.  See Parnell , \n818 F.3d at 980; Bong, 913 F.3d at 1266- 67.  As explained above, however, 11 Del. C. \n\u00a7 832(a)(2) requires \u201can objective physical manifestation that the robber appears to be displaying a weapon.\u201d  Deshields , 706 A.2d at 507. \n6. In sum, none of Stanford\u2019s argument s provides a meritor ious bas is for his \nobjections to the base offense level and criminal history category in the presentence investigation report.   Because first -degree and second-degree robbery under Delaware law are crimes of \nviolence within the meaning of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, Stanford\u2019s PSR properly  \n10 determined that Stanford has two prior such offenses.5 \n7. Finally, Stanford contends that the PSR  improperly includes a four- level  \nenhancement for an offense involving a firearm with \u201can altered or obliterated serial number.\u201d  \nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4).  Stanford argues that the serial number on the firearm he possessed was \nnot altered or obliterated because it was \u201ccompletely legible and required no scientific technique to restore it to that condition,\u201d so \u201cthe traceability of the firearm was not impaired.\u201d  (D.I. 57 at 14)  The Third Circuit has not addressed  the proper interpretation of \u201caltered or obliterated\u201d in \n\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4).  ( See D.I. 58 at 9)  Stanford urges this Court to adopt the \u201cnaked eye\u201d test , \nwhich provide s that a serial number is \u201caltered\u201d only if it is  illegible to the naked eye .  See \ngenerally United States v. St. Hilaire , 960 F.3d 61, 66-68 (2d Cir. 2020); United States v. Sands , \n948 F.3d 709, 715 (6th Cir. 2020).  The Court declines to adopt the \u201cnaked eye\u201d test , which has \nno apparent basis in the plain text of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4).  I nstead , the Court relies on ordinary \nmeaning: \u201ca firearm\u2019s serial number is \u2018altered or obliterated\u2019  when  it is materially changed in a \nway that makes accurate information less accessible.\u201d  United States v. Carter , 421 F.3d 909, \n910 (9th Cir. 2005); see also United States v. Perez , 585 F.3d 880, 883-85 (5th Cir. 2009) \n(adopting Carter  standard); United States v. Millender , 791 F. App\u2019x 782, 783 (11th Cir. 2019) \n(per curiam)  (endorsing interpretation of \u201caltered\u201d to mean \u201cchanged in some way\u201d because, in \npart, the more stringent \u201c illegibility \u201d requirement \u201cwould render \u2018obliterated\u2019 superfluous\u201d) .  \nThe Court a grees that this interpretation of \u201caltered\u201d faithfully follows  the ordinary meaning of \nthat term.  This interpretation is also consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), which is to \n \n5 Given this conclusion, the Court agrees with the government that the Court need not \naddress Stanford\u2019s prior conviction for attempt ed second -degree robbery.  ( See D.I. 70 at 13 n.9)  \n11 \u201cpunish[] possession of weapons that appear more difficult to trace.\u201d  Carter , 421 F.3d at 915 \n(emphasis omitted).  \n8. Applying this  standard here, the serial number on the gun that Stanford possessed \nis altered .  At the evidentiary hearing, an agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms \nand Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d) testified that the serial number has scratches through all its digits , and \nfrom certain angles the scratches make it difficult to read the serial numb er.  ( See Tr. at 7 -8)  \nTo obtain the serial number for an evidence label  (and especially to decipher the first letter, \nwhich might be read, initially, as either a \u201cT\u201d or an \u201cF\u201d) , the agent was required to \u201cmanipulate \nthe firearm .\u201d  (Id. at 14)  S he could not read the serial number  accurately and easily from every \nangle.   (Id.)  If the serial number had not been scratched, such manipulation would not have \nbeen required.  ( Id.)  The Court had an opportunity to view the firearm for itself, and the \nCourt\u2019s impression is consistent with the agent\u2019s testimony.  ( See generally D.I. 58-1 Ex. C)   \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the firearm involved in Stanford\u2019s offense has an altered serial \nnumber.  Although the PSR  incorrectly refers to the serial number as \u201cobliterated\u201d (D.I. 56 at 7), \nthe same four- level enhancement under \u00a7  2K2.1(b)(4) still applies  to a firearm with an \u201caltered\u201d \nserial number .6 \n \n \n________________________________ \nFebruary 1, 2022 HONORABLE LEONARD P. STARK  \nWilmington, Delaware  UNITED STATES DISTRICT  JUDGE  \n \n6 Even if a four- level enhancement did not apply because of the altered serial number, a \ntwo-level enhancement would still apply because the evidence shows that the firearm was stolen.  \nSee U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) .  The ATF agent testified that , in 2017, the firearm was stolen \nduring a \u201chome invasion type of incident\u201d in Philadelphia.  (Tr. at 9)   Stanford has not \nmeaningfully rebutted that evidence.  \n"}
