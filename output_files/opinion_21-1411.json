(D.I. 22.)  As \nannounced from the bench on July 7, 2022, I recommend that  Defendants\u2019  motion be  DENIED.   \nI. DISCUSSION  \nMy Report and Recommendation was announced from the bench as follows:  \nThis is my Report and Recommendation on the pending \nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  I will summarize the reasons for my \nrecommendation in a moment.  But before I do, I want to be clear that my failure to address a particular argument does not mean that I did not consider it.  W e have considered all of the arguments.  I \nalso note that, while we will not be issuing a separate written recommendation, we will issue a written document incorporating a transcript of the recommendation that I am about to make. \n  For the following reason s, I recommend that the Court deny \nDefendants \u2019 motion to dismiss.  \n 2 \n Plaintiffs Allergan, Inc., Allergan Pharmaceuticals Ireland \nUnlimited Company, and Allergan USA, Inc. (collectively, \n\u201cAllergan \u201d or \u201cPlaintiffs \u201d) market the drugs BOTOX\u00ae and \nBOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic, which contain botulinum toxin.  BOTOX\u00ae and BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic are ind icated for multiple therapeutic and \naesthetic indications including prophylaxis of migraines and improvement in the appearance of forehead lines.\n1  Plaintiffs own \nor are the exclusive licensees of numerous patents covering aspects of their formulations, m anufacturing processes, and assays.\n2   \n  Defendant Revance Therapeutics, Inc.  (\u201cRevance\u201d)  has \ndeveloped its own botulinum toxin product, called \nDaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection ( \u201cDAXI\u201d ).\n3  In November 2019, \nRevance  filed a Biologics License Application ( \u201cBLA \u201d) with the \nFDA, through which Revance seeks approval to market D AXI.4 The \nFDA accepted Revance \u2019s BLA on February 5, 2020, and it initially \nset a target action date of November 25, 2020.5  However, on \nNovember 24, 2020, the FDA deferred its decision due to COVID -\nrelated travel restrictions that prevented it from inspecting \nRevance \u2019s manufacturing facility, which is one of the final steps that \nneeds to occur before approval.6   \n  The FDA inspected Revance\u2019 s manu facturing facility in \nJune and July 2021.\n7  On July 2, 2021, the FDA issued a Form 483 \nlisting deficiencies identified during the on- site inspection.8   \nFollowing issuance of the Form 483, Revance \u2019s CEO stated during \n \n1 (D.I. 16 (FAC) \u00b6\u00b6  20\u201321.)  \n \n2 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26, 30, 34, 38 , 42.)  \n \n3 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 48\u201349.)  \n \n4 (Id. \u00b6 65.)   \n \n5 (Id. \u00b6 66.)   \n \n6 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 67 \u201369.)   \n \n7 (Id. \u00b6 70.)  \n   \n8 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 70, 73.)  \n 3 \n a conference presentation that the in spection was \u201c a very typical \ninspection.\u201d9  \n \nIn a press release in August 2021, Revance stated that it was \n\u201cactively building inventory and preparing for commercial \nlaunch.\u201d10  And in a press release on October 12, 2021, Revance \nstated that it \u201c remains co nfident in the quality of its BLA submission \nand continues to anticipate FDA approval in 2021.\u201d11  \n  On October 15, 2021, Revance announced that the FDA had \nissued a Complete Response Letter ( \u201cCRL \u201d) indicating that the BLA \ncould not be approved in its pres ent form due to deficiencies related \nto the FDA \u2019s onsite inspection.\n12  According to Revance, \u201c [n]o other \ndeficiencies were identified in the CRL. \u201d13   \n  In a November 9, 2021, SEC filing, Revance  stated that it \nhad received additional information from the FDA and that the company planned to file a Type A meeting request with the FDA.\n14  \n[Also on that day, Revance\u2019s CEO ] stated  that the FDA had \nprovided Revance with an Establishment Inspection Report that included feedback and an approval pathway for DAXI.\n15  He further \nstated that the company was looking at \u201c all different avenues \u201d to \nlaunch \u201c as soon as possible.\u201d16   \n  Plaintiffs filed this case on October 1, 2021, and they filed \ntheir FAC on November 24, 2021.  The FAC names Revance as a defendant, and it also names Ajinomoto Althea, Inc. ( \u201cABPS \u201d), with \n \n9 (Id. \u00b6 71.)   \n \n10 (Id. \u00b6 79, E x. 35.)   \n \n11 (Id. \u00b6 72, E x. 29.)  \n \n12 (Id. \u00b6 73 , Exs. 30, 31.)  \n \n13 (Id., Ex. 32 at 31, Ex. 33 at 5 ( \u201c[T]he CRL is not related to our clinical data package or \nour product anticipated label .\u201d).) \n \n14 (Id. \u00b6 74, Ex. 32.)  \n \n15 (Id. \u00b6 75, Ex. 33.)   \n \n16 (Id. \u00b6 76, Ex. 33 at 9.)  \n 4 \n which Revance has entered into a drug product manufacturing \nagreement.17  \n  The FAC contains twelve counts.  The parties refer to six \ncounts (Counts I, III, V, VII, IX, and XI) as the stockpiling counts.  Those counts allege that Defendants \u2019 manufacture, use, or \nimportation into the United States of batches of the  DAXI product \nin preparation for launch and substrates used to assay the product has infringed six of Plaintiffs \u2019 patents: U.S. Patent No. 11,033,625 \n(the \u2019625 patent), which covers pharmaceutical compositions \ncontaining botulinum toxin; U.S. Patent No. 11,147,878 (the \u2019878 \npatent), which covers methods of stabilizing a botulinum toxin; U.S. Patent Nos. 7,354,740 (the \u2019 740 patent), 8,409,828 (the \u2019 828 patent), \nand 11,124,786 (the \u2019 786 patent), all of which cover processes for \npurifying a botulinum toxin; and U.S. P atent No. 7,332,567 (the \n\u2019567 patent), which covers substrates for botulinum toxin activity \nassays.  \n  The parties refer to the remaining six counts (Counts II, IV, \nVI, VIII, X, and XII) as the DJ counts.  Through those counts, Plaintiffs seek declaratory j udgments that Defendants \u2019 manufacture, \nuse, offer for sale, or sale within the United States of the D AXI \nproduct will infringe the same six patents.   \n  \nOn December 17, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss \nthe FAC under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subj ect matter jurisdiction \nand under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.\n18  After the \nmotion was fully briefed, the Court granted the parties leave to file supplemental briefing, which they did on June 7 and June 21, 2022.\n19  Plaintiff requested argum ent and I heard oral argument \nearlier today.   \n I\u2019ll start with Defendants \u2019 contention that the Court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction over all twelve counts.   The first step in a \nsubject matter jurisdiction analysis is determining whether the \u201c12(b)(1) motion presents a \u2018 facial \u2019 or a \u2018 factual \u2019 attack on the claim \nat issue, because that distinction determines how the pleading must \n \n17 (Id. \u00b6 58.) \n \n18 (D.I. 22.)   \n \n19 (D.I. 23, 26, 27, 33, 34.)    \n 5 \n be reviewed.\u201d20  The Third Circuit has explained the differences \nbetween a facial and a factual attack [ as follows:  \n \nA facial attack, as the adjective indicates, is \nan argument that considers a claim on its face and \nasserts that it is insufficient to invoke the subject matter jurisdictio n of the court because, for example, \nit does not present a question of federal law, or because there is no indication of a diversity of \ncitizenship among the parties, or because some other \njurisdictional defect is present.  Such an attack can \noccur before the moving party has filed an answer or \notherwise contested the factual allegations of the complaint.  . . . A factual attack, on the other hand, is \nan argument that there is no subject matter jurisdiction because the facts of the case\u2014and here the District Court may look beyond the pleadings to \nascertain the facts \u2014do not support the asserted \njurisdiction. So, for example, while diversity of citizenship might have been adequately pleaded by the plaintiff, the defendant can submit proof that, in fact, diversi ty is lacking.  . . . In sum, a facial attack \n\u201ccontests the sufficiency of the pleadings,\u201d  In re \nSchering Plough Corp., [ 678 F.3d 235, 243 (3d Cir. \n2012)] , \u201cwhereas a factual attack concerns the actual \nfailure of a [plaintiff \u2019s] claims to comport [factually ] \nwith the jurisdictional prerequisites.\u201d   CNA v. United \nStates, 535 F.3d 132, 139 (3d Cir.  2008) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (alterations in original).  \n  In reviewing a facial attack, \u201cthe court must \nonly consider the allegations of the complaint a nd \ndocuments referenced therein and attached thereto, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d   In re \nSchering Plough Corp., 678 F.3d at 243 \n(quoting Gould Elecs. Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d \n169, 176 (3d Cir.  2000)) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Thus, a facial attack calls for a district \ncourt to apply the same standard of review it would \nuse in considering a motion to dismiss under Rule \n \n20 Const itution  Party v. Aichele, 757 F.3d 347, 357 (3d Cir. 2014); see also Mitek Sys., Inc. \nv. United Servs. Auto. Ass \u2019n, 34 F.4th 1334, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (vacating dismissal for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction and remanding for further proceedings where the district court was \u201cunclear in identifying whether it was treating the Rule 12(b)(1) motion as a facial chall enge or as \na factual challenge, . . . and the parties themselves have been unclear about this \u201d). 6 \n 12(b)(6),  i.e., construing the alleged facts in favor of \nthe nonmoving party.  Id.   This is in marked co ntrast \nto the standard of review applicable to a factual \nattack, in which a court may weigh and \u201cconsider evidence outside the pleadings.\u201d   Gould Elecs. \nInc., 220 F.3d at 176 (citing Gotha v. United States, 115 F.3d 176, 178 \u201379 (3d Cir.1997)).]\n21 \n \nDefendants \u2019 briefing contends that they are mounting a \nfactual attack.22  But Defendants failed to submit any evidence ( i.e., \naffidavits, testimony, or other evidentiary materials) with their opening brief to contradict the FAC \u2019s factual allegations in sup port \nof subject matter jurisdiction.  Rather, Defendants \u2019 briefs focus on \nwhat they contend is the FAC \u2019s failure to allege sufficient \njurisdictional facts.\n23  That suggests a facial challenge.24  \n  Compounding the confusion, Plaintiffs insist that \nDefendan ts\u2019 attack is facial \u2014which would restrict the Court \u2019s \nreview to the allegations and documents referred to in the FAC \u2014\nyet Plaintiffs submitted hundreds of pages of exhibits in opposing \nDefendants \u2019 motion.\n25  What \u2019s more, most of those exhibits did not \nexist  at the time Plaintiffs filed the FAC and therefore have limited \nrelevance to the question of whether subject matter jurisdiction \nexisted at the time of the FAC.26 \n \n \n21 Aichele, 757 F.3d at 358. \n \n22 (D.I. 23 at 7.)   \n \n23 (See D.I. 23 at 7 ( \u201c[T]he FAC fails to demonstrate subject matter jurisdiction. \u201d); id. at 8 \n(\u201cAllergan did not and cannot allege sufficient facts . . . . \u201d); id. at 9 ( \u201cSimilarly, Allergan \u2019s \nallegations fail to show . . . . \u201d); id. at 12 ( \u201c[T]he FAC fails to establish . . . . \u201d); id. at 12 ( \u201cThe FAC \ncontains two allegations . . . both of which fail to establish subject matter jurisdiction. \u201d).) \n \n24 See Aichele, 757 F.3d at 359 ( \u201cA factual attack requires a factual dispute . . . . \u201d); see also \nTSMC Tech., Inc. v. Zond, LLC , No. 14- 721-LPS-CJB, 2015 WL 661364, at *3 (D. Del. Feb. 13, \n2015)  (treating a challenge as facial when the movant \u2019s \u201cemphasis [was] on why the allegations in \nthe Complaint (and [a letter], attached as an exhibit to the Complaint),  even accepted as true, [ did] \nnot demonstrate that a case or controversy exist [ed]\u201d ). \n \n25 (D.I. 26, Exs . 1\u20132; D.I. 33, Ex. 3\u201310.)  \n \n26 See Microsoft Corp. v. DataTern, Inc., 755 F.3d 899, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\u201c[P ]ost-\ncomplaint facts cannot create jurisdiction where none existed at the time of filing.\u201d).  \n 7 \n Here is how I see this : The motion presently before the Court \nargues that subject matter ju risdiction was lacking at the time \nPlaintiffs filed the FAC .  Defendants failed to submit any evidence \nin support of their motion, and they are essentially saying that the \nFAC allegations, even accepted as true, are insufficient to demonstrate subject matter jurisdiction.  In light of that, I will \nconsider Defendants \u2019 motion as a facial challenge.  Accordingly, I \nwill consider the allegations and documents attached to the FAC and view them in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs.\n27 \n I\u2019ll now t urn to Defendants \u2019 argument that the Court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction over the stockpiling counts.  Defendants say that the Court lacks jurisdiction because they might never sell the product they are alleged to have stockpiled.  To put it bluntly, that argument is a nonstarter.  You don\u2019t have to sell a product to \ninfringe a patent.  It is an act of patent infringement to make or import a patented product or to use a patented method.\n28  The FAC \nalleges that Defendants have already done all of those t hings in the \ncourse of making the stockpiled batches.   \n  Defendants alternatively contend that the Court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction because it might in the future \u201c utilize \u201d the \nbatches it is alleged to have stockpiled \u201c to support its response to \nthe [FDA]. \u201d\n29  According to Defendants, their past activities are \ntherefore shielded by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(1), which states that it is not an act of infringement to make, use, or import a patented invention \u201csolely for uses reasonably related to the developm ent and \nsubmission of information\u201d  to the FDA.   \n  That argument is also a nonstarter, for at least three reasons. \nFirst, Defendants have provided no support for the proposition that application of the statutory safe harbor implicates the Court \u2019s \nsubject m atter jurisdiction, and I am unaware of any.  Second, the \nFAC alleges \u2014citing to Revance \u2019s own statements \u2014that Revance \nwas \u201cactively building inventory\u201d  in preparation for \u201c commercial \n \n27 At oral argument, Plaintiffs accurately point ed out that  jurisdiction also needed to exist \nat the time the original complaint was filed.  See Innovative Therapies, Inc. v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 599 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  But that\u2019s beside the point.  Subject matter juris diction \nneeds to be present at all stages of a case, and I take Defendants\u2019 argument to be that jurisdiction was lacking at the time of the FAC.   \n \n28 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a).  \n \n29 (D.I. 23 at 14.)  \n 8 \n launch.\u201d30  Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, that \nallegation is sufficient to support a plausible inference that Revance \ndid not make and import the batches in question \u201c solely for uses \nreasonably related to \u201d its FDA submission.31 \n \nThird, insofar as Defendants contend that a drug \nmanufacturer may escape infring ement liability for making and \nimporting commercial- sized drug batches with the intent to sell \nthem if it later submits data regarding those batches to the FDA, \nDefendants have cited no case supporting that proposition and I am unaware of any.\n32  For those reasons, I recommend that the Court \ndeny Defendants \u2019 request to dismiss the stockpiling claims for lack \nof jurisdiction.   \n I\u2019ll now turn to Defendants \u2019 argument that the Court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction over the DJ counts. As noted earlier, Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgments that Defendants \u2019 future \nmaking, using, importing, and selling of DAXI  will infringe \nPlaintiffs \u2019 patents.   \n  The Declaratory Judgment Act,  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a), \nprovides that \u201c[i ]n a  case of actual  controversy within its \njurisdiction, . . . any court of the United States, upon the filing of an \nappropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\u201d  The phrase \u201c case of actual \ncontroversy\u201d  refers to the type of \u201c Cases \u201d and \u201cControversies \u201d that \nare justiciable under Article III of the Constitution.\n33   \n  To meet the case or controversy requirement, a dispute must \nbe \u201c\u2018definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties \nhaving adverse legal interests \u2019; and . . . \u2018 real and substantial \u2019 and \n\u2018admi[t] of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, \n \n30 (FAC \u00b6 79.)  \n \n31 Cf. Amgen Inc. v. Hospira, Inc., 944 F.3d 1327, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (holding that when \nthe asserted patent covers methods of manufacture, \u201c [t]he relevant inquiry . . . is not  how  [the \ndefendant] used each batch it manufactured, but whether each act of manufacture was for uses reasonably related to submitting information to the FDA \u201d). \n \n32 Cf. id. at 1340 n.3 (rejecting contention that \u201c simply submitting information about a drug \nsubstance lot to the FDA brings the manufacture of that lot within the Safe Harbor \u201d). \n \n33 MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc. , 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007).  \n 9 \n as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be \nupon a hypothetical state of facts.\u2019\u201d34  The Supreme Court has \nrecognized that its precedents \u201cdo not draw the brightest of lines between those declaratory -judgment actions that satisfy the case -or-\ncontroversy requirement and that do not,\u201d a nd that, where \njurisdiction is being assessed based on the complaint, \u201c[b]asically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal inte rests, of sufficient immediacy and \nreality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d\n35  \n  Defendants contend that the FAC fails to allege facts \nshowing a controversy of sufficient \u201cimmediacy \u201d and \u201creality. \u201d  \nWhen assessing \u201c immediacy ,\u201d courts consider \u201chow far in the future \nthe potential infringement is, whether the passage of time might \neliminate or change any dispute, and how much if any harm the \npotential infringer is experiencing, at the time of suit, that an \nadjudication might redress.\u201d\n36  When assessing \u201creality ,\u201d courts \nexamine \u201cany uncertainties about whether the [accused] will take an \naction that will expose it to potential infringement liability and, if so, exactly what action.\u201d\n37  Determining whether a controversy is of \nsufficient imme diacy and reality is fact specific and must be \ndetermined on a case- by-case basis by considering the totality of the \ncircumstances.38   \n  Having examined the totality of the allegations, I conclude \nthat the FAC alleges a controversy of sufficient immediacy  and \nreality.  Plaintiffs say that D AXI and the process for manufacturing \nit infringe Plaintiffs \u2019 patents.  The FAC alleges that shortly before \nthis action was filed, Revance told the public that it was actively building inventory of D AXI in preparation for a launch.  That fact \nalone is probably enough to satisfy the case or controversy \n \n34 Id. (citing Aetna  Life Ins. Co. v.  Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240 (1937) ). \n \n35 Id.

June 13, 2017). \n 10 \n requirement.39  But I do not need to decide that because there is \nmore.  For example, the FAC also alleges that Revance made public \nstatements that it anticipated FDA approv al in 2021.  Those facts, \nviewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, suggest that even \nDefendants thought that FDA approval was imminent.   \n  \nDefendants point out that those things happened before the \nFDA issued the CRL in October 2021 and that when the FAC was \nfiled in November, it was uncertain if and when the BLA would ever \nbe approved.  Defendants also point out that Revance has up to a year to submit a response to a CRL, and because Revance\u2019 s response \nto the FDA may include changes to D AXI and t he process for \nmaking it, the facts relevant to infringement are fluid and indeterminate and thus fail the reality requirement.   \n  I reject Defendants \u2019 position.  As an initial matter, I do not \nthink that the mere fact that a CRL was issued makes this dis pute \nnonjusticiable.  [W]e  don\u2019t know what was in the [CRL],  and we \ndon\u2019t know what the FDA was requiring from Revance in terms of \na response.  The FAC does allege, however, that the CRL related to issues discovered during the onsite inspection (as opposed to the \nclinical data or proposed product label) and that, even after receiving \nthe Form 483 report regarding the onsite inspection, Revance told the public that it still expected approval in 2021.  Those facts, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaint iffs, permit a reasonable \ninference that Revance thought it would not have to change its product to remediate whatever deficiencies were identified in the onsite inspection.  As noted during oral argument, I find ironic \nDefendants \u2019 position that uncertaint ies about when Revance would \nrespond to the CRL and what it would need to submit make this dispute nonjusticiable.  If Defendants actually thought in November 2021 that the FDA \u2019s identified approval pathway required changes \nto the product and/or process that are material to infringement or that it might take a year for Revance to put together its response, one might have expected Revance to mount a true factual challenge and submit evidence regarding its interactions with the FDA.  It did not.   \n  At a minimum, Plaintiffs are entitled to seek a declaration \nthat the product that Defendants already produced would infringe if \n \n39 See Cat Tech LLC v. TubeMaster, Inc., 528 F.3d 871, 881 (Fed. Cir. 2008)  (concluding \nthat the immediacy requirement does not necessitate that a party \u201c have engaged in the actual \nmanufacture or sale of a potentially infringing product,\u201d  but that \u201c there must be a showing of \n\u2018meaningful preparation\u2019  for m aking or using that product \u201d (quoting Arrowhead Indus. Water, Inc. \nv. Ecolochem, Inc., 846 F.2d 731, 736 (Fed. Cir. 1988) )). \n 11 \n imported or sold.  If [Revance]  thought that the changes requested \nby the FDA might result in [it]  not being able to sell its alleged \nstockpile, one might have thought [it ] would have  submit ted \nevidence of that fact.  It did not.40   \n \nTo be clear, I am not putting the burden on Defendants to put \nforth evidence.  Plaintiffs retain the burden to allege facts that establish that subject matter jurisdiction  exists.  I am merely \npointing out that because Defendants did not submit evidence, t his \nis a facial challenge and I must view the FAC in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs.  And I conclude that it adequately alleges a \ncontroversy of sufficient immediacy and reality.   \n  This case is distinguishable from the  Juno Therapeutics , \nClarus T herapeutics , and Teva Pharmaceuticals  cases cited by \nDefendants.\n41  Among other differences, those cases didn\u2019 t involve \nan allegation of past infringement or an allegation that the defendants had already manufactured infringing product that [they]  \nplanned to sell.\n42  The facts [in this case] permit a reasonable \ninference that FDA approval was imminent . \n I conclude that a case of actual controversy existed as of the \nfiling of the FAC.  For those reasons , I recommend that the Court \ndeny Defendants \u2019 request to  dismiss the declaratory judgment  \nclaims for lack of jurisdiction.   \n Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs would suffer no harm \nor prejudice if the court waited to hear this case until after the FDA \u2019s \napproval decision and that doing so would further judicial \n \n40 As noted above, subsequent factual developments cannot create jurisdiction over a claim \nif none existed at the time of filing.  I note, however, that Plaintiffs submitted evidence suggesting \nthat Revance has already responded to the CRL and that it has told the public that it still hopes to use the product it has already produced.  \n \n41 Teva Pharms.

Defendants \nhaven \u2019t moved for a stay, and the Court has jurisdiction over the \nstockpiling claims and a duty to exercise it.  As for the declaratory \njudgment  claims, Defendants \u2019 argument m ight be viewed as a \nrequest that the C ourt use its discretion to decline to exercise \njurisdiction.  I would reject that request.  The Court is already going \nto hear the stockpiling claims.  It will promote judicial economy to \nhear both the stockpiling clai ms and the DJ claims together.   Indeed, \nas Defendants \u2019 counsel pointed out during oral argument today, it \nmakes no sense to litigate the DJ and stockpiling claims piecemeal.  \n  Defendants cite the Abraxis\n44 case, apparently for the \nproposition that the Fede ral Circuit has the ability to vacate cases \nfor lack of jurisdiction even after the district court holds a trial and \nenters judgment.  That is true, but that is not a reason for a district \ncourt to decline to hear a case that is otherwise properly before t he \ncourt.  If Defendants \u2019 point is that subject matter jurisdiction must \nexist at the time a suit is filed and thereafter, I agree.  As explained above, it did in this case.  \n Turning to Defendants \u2019 request to dismiss the claims under \nRule 12(b)(6) , I am no t going to read into the record my \nunderstanding of the legal standard that applies to such a motion, or how that standard has been applied in the context of pleading \ninfringement.  I set forth a recitation of the applicable legal standards in my Report and Recommendation in Bos ton Fog, LLC v. Ryobi \nTech nologies , Inc., No. 19- 2310- LPS-JLH, 2020 WL 1532372, at \n*3 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2020).\n45  And I incorporate that discussion by \nreference.   \n \n \n43 (D.I. 23 at 5\u20137.)   \n \n44 Abraxis Bioscience, Inc. v. Navinta LLC , 625 F.3d 1359, 1362\u201363 (Fed. Cir. 2010).    \n \n45 Bos. Fog, LLC v. Ryobi Techs., Inc., No. 19 -2310- LPS-JLH, 2020 WL 1532372, at *3 \n(D. Del. Mar. 31, 2020), adopted, 2020 WL 8079820 (June 12, 2020).  A defendant may move to \ndismiss a complaint under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  for failure to state a claim. \n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009)  (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on \nits face when the complaint contains \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d Id.  (citing  Twombly , 550 U.S. at \n556). A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.  \u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely \n 13 \n  \nDetermining whether a claim  is plausible is a \u201ccontext -\nspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial \nexperience and common sense.\u201d46  I conclude that the allegations set \nforth in the FAC are sufficient to put Defendants on notice of the infringing activity.  The FAC specifically identifies an accused \nproduct, and it alleges that the product and the process of \nmanufacturing the product meet every limitation of at least one claim in each of the asserted patents.   It also points to SEC filings \nand other exhibits that demonstrate Plaintiffs \u2019 view as to how at least \nsome of the claim elements of a representative claim from each \npatent are met.  Under these circumstances, I conclude that the \ninfringement claims are plausible.\n47  \n \n \nconsistent with\u2019 a defendant's liability, it \u2018stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 557). \n  In determining the sufficiency of the complaint under the plausibility standard, all \u201cwell -\npleaded facts\u201d are assumed to be true, but legal conclusions are not.  Id. at 679.  \u201c[W]hen the \nallegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 ( quotation omi tted).  \n  A complaint sufficiently pleads direct patent infringement when it puts the defendant \u201con \nnotice of what activity  . . . is being accused of infringement.\u201d Nalco Co. v. Chem -Mod, LLC , 883 \nF.3d 1337, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting K -Tech Telecomms.,  Inc. v. Time Warner Cable, Inc. , \n714 F.3d 1277, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2013)); see also BioM\u00e9rieux, S.A. v. Hologic, Inc., No. 18- 21-LPS, \n2018 WL 4603267, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 25, 2018).  There is no requirement that the plaintiff \u201cplead \nfacts establishing that each element of an asserted claim is met.\u201d Nalco , 883 F.3d at 1350 (quoting \nIn re Bill of Lading Transmission & Processing Sys. Patent Litig., 681 F.3d 1323, 1335 (Fed.

Supp. 3d 435, 444 (D. Del. 2018)  (finding \ncomplaint sufficient where it alleged that the accused products practice d a representative claim \nand provided examples drawn from product documentation demonstrating that the accused product possessed at least some of the requirements of the repr esentative claim); see also Vitaworks IP, \nLLC v.

Brightcove Inc., No. 19- 1190- CFC, 2020 WL 4192613, at *2 (D. Del. July \n21, 2020). \n 14 \n That said, I \u2019ll briefly run through what D efendants say are \nthe deficiencies in the FAC.   First, Defendants say the FAC fails to \nstate a plausible claim for the same reason it fails to adequately \nallege subject matter jurisdiction.  I reject that argument because I conclude that there is subject m atter jurisdiction.\n48 \n \nSecond, Defendants point to the fact that the FAC alleges \n\u201con information and belief \u201d that some of the claim limitations are \nmet, including certain limitations related to botulinum toxin \npurification and potency.49  Defendants say th at renders the claims \nimplausible.  I reject that argument.  For one thing, pleading upon information and belief is permissible where, as here, facts like the potency of Defendants \u2019 product and its method of manufacture are \nparticularly within the defendant \u2019s knowledge and control.\n50 \n  Moreover, there is no requirement that a complaint plead \ninfringement on an element -by-element basis.\n51  And, again, the \nallegations in the FAC put Defendants on notice of what Plaintiffs say is the infringing activity.  \n Defendants make a more specific argument regarding \nCounts XI and XII.  Those counts allege that Revance has and will infringe the \u2019 567 patent, which contains product claims that cover \nsubstrates for botulinum toxin activity assays.  The claims all require substrates that have the following characteristic: \u201c under the \nappropriate conditions, resonance energy transfer is exhibited between said donor fluorophore and said acceptor fluorophore. \u201d  \nAccording to Defendants, an exhibit attached to the FAC \n \n48 The possibility that some of Defendants\u2019 actions might be protected by the statutory s afe \nharbor does not make the infringement claims implausible .  As discussed above, the allegations \nsupport  a plausible inference that Revanc e has already infringed by stockpiling product .  This case \nis thus distinguishable from cases in which the complaint itself left no reasonable inference other \nthan that the allegedly infringing conduct was protected by the safe harbor defense .

I understand \nwhat Defendants are saying.  However, at this stage, the Court is reviewing the claim for plausibility.  [I] t is plausible that the product \nclaims at issue [might later be construed to] only require a substrate \ncapable of exhibiting energy transfer, even if Defendants \u2019 assay \nmethod doesn\u2019t take advantage of that phenomenon.\n52 \n  For the reasons stated, I recommend that Defendants \u2019 motion \nto dismiss be denied. \n \nII.
