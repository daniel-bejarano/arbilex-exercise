Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Kilolo Kijakazi is substituted \nfor former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul, who was originally named as \nDefendant in this suit.   2 BURKE, United States Magistrate Judge \nPlaintiff Denise Painter Roberts (\u201c Roberts \u201d or \u201cPlaintiff\u201d) appeals from a decision of \nDefendant Kilolo Kijakazi, the Acting  Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d or \n\u201cDefendant\u201d), denying Roberts\u2019 application for disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title \nII of the Social Security Act  (\u201cSSA\u201d) .  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-33.  Th e Court has jurisdiction over \nthe matter pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).    Presently pending before the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Roberts and the Commissioner (the \u201cmotions\u201d).  (D.I. 13; D.I.  15)  Roberts asks the Court to \nvacate the Commissioner\u2019s decision and remand to the Commissioner for further proceedings.  (D.I. 1 4 at 20; D.I. 17 at 4)  The Commissioner opposes that request and asks that the Court \naffirm h er decision.  (D.I. 16 at 10)  For the reasons set forth below, Roberts\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment will be  GRANTED, the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary \njudgment will be DENIED  and the case will be REMANDED to the Commissioner for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. I.  BACKGROUND A.  Procedural  Background \nOn August 14, 2018, Roberts applied  for DIB; she alleged disability beginning on \nNovember 6, 2017.  (D.I.  10 (hereinafter \u201cTr.\u201d)  at 15, 152, 174)  H er claim was initially denied.  \n(Id. at  73)  Roberts then filed a request for a n administrative  hearing.  ( Id. at 90-91)  On \nDecember 17, 2019, a hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), at  which \nRoberts was represented by counsel .  (Id. at 29-72)     \nOn February 6, 2020, the ALJ issued a decision  denying Roberts\u2019 request for  benefits.  \n(Id. at 12-23)  Roberts  requested review of the ALJ\u2019s decision by the Appeals Council, and the \n3 Appeals Council later denied Roberts\u2019 request for review .  (Id. at 1-3)  Thus, the ALJ\u2019s decision \nbecame the final decision of the Commissioner.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.955 & 404.981; Sims v. \nApfel , 530 U.S. 103, 106-07 (2000). \nOn January 7, 2021, Roberts  filed a Complaint in this Court seeking judicial review of \nthe ALJ\u2019s decision .  (D.I. 1)  On August 2, 2021, Roberts filed h er motion for summary \njudgment.  (D.I. 13)  The Commissioner opposed Roberts\u2019 motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on August 31, 2021.  (D.I. 1 5)  Briefing on the respective motions was \ncompleted on September 17, 2021.  (D.I. 17)  On September 29, 2021, the parties consented to \nthe Court\u2019s jurisdiction to conduct all proceedings in this action, including entry of a final judgment.  (D.I. 19)      \nB.  Factual Background \nAt the time of the alleged onset of her  disability on November 6, 2017, Roberts was 61 \nyears old; at the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision  in February 2020, she was 63.  ( See Tr. at 152)  \nRoberts is a college graduate and , as will be further discussed below, has past work experience as  \na senior industrial engineer and a continuous improvement manager.  ( Id. at 175)   \n1.  Roberts\u2019 Mental Health -related Medical History, Treatment, and \nCondition \n \nRoberts alleges that she has been disabled and unable to work since November 2017 due  \n to post- traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d), anxiety and depression.  ( Id. at 74, 174, 176, 192;  \n D.I. 14 at 1)  Relevant evidence of record regarding those conditions is set out below.\n2 \n \n2  The Court focuses its summary on the evidence relevant to Roberts\u2019 mental \nimpairments, which are the subject of Roberts\u2019 appeal.  In addition to her mental health issues, \nRoberts does also suffer from certain physical impairments  relating to  her hands, ankle and \nshoulder, (D.I. 1 4 at 6; Tr. at 21, 48-49, 552-60, 576, 585), but the Court will not describe those \nailments  in greater detail here.     4 In July 2015, Roberts began treating with her therapist, Laura B. Hummel, DNP, APRN , \non a regular basis for panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, \nPTSD and attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) .  (Tr. at 326; see also id. at 273)   In \nDecember 2016, Roberts reported to Ms. Hummel that she had anxiety as  her job was \u201cvery \noverwhelming\u201d and she had worked \u201c13 days in a row [,]\u201d and her mother was not doing well.  \n(Id. at 272)   She was prescribed duloxe tine and alprazolam.  ( Id. at 273)  In March 2017, Roberts \nreported that she was \u201cpartially improved\u201d following a three -day cruise to the Bahamas.  ( Id. at \n274)  Nevertheless, her anxiety symptoms persisted and work continued to be \u201cvery hectic.\u201d  (Id.)  Roberts  report ed continuing and worsening anxiety symptoms in June and July 2017, a nd \nthat she was easily distracted and having a  tendency to blurt out a nswers .  (Id. at 277, 280)  On \nJune 21, 2017, Roberts was prescribed vyvanse (to take in addition to duloxetine and alprazolam).  ( Id. at 278)  In  October 2017, Roberts appeared sad and near tears; she reported \nthat her mother had just passed away and she also noted that  her employer had downsized, which \nresulted in an increased workload for her.  ( Id. at 283- 84)   \nFrom November 7, 2017 (the day after Roberts alleges that her disability began) to \nSeptember 11, 2019, Roberts visited Ms. Hummel 13 times.  ( Id. at 286- 317, 331- 41)  For each  \nof these visits, on examination, Ms. Hummel noted that Roberts was \u201ctearful \u201d or near tears  or \nunhappy, and/or that she had a \u201c[f]acial expression and general demeanor reveal[ing  a] depressed \nmood[,]\u201d and that she  exhibited \u201csigns of anxiety\u201d  and/or was \u201ceasily distracted.\u201d  (Id. at 287, \n290, 293, 296, 300, 303, 306, 309, 312, 316, 332, 336, 340)  That said, in these visits , Roberts \nwas also reported to have displayed intact cognitive functioning and cooperative behavior , to \nhave intact associations, logical thinking, appropriate thought content , and the ability to abstract 5 and do arithmetic calculations .  (Id. at 287, 290, 293, 296, 300, 303, 306, 309, 312, 316, 332, \n336, 340)     \nOn November 7, 2017, Roberts reported to Ms. Hummel that \u201c[e]verything has caught up \nwith her\u201d and that she was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d with \u201cextra work, being executor of [her] mom\u2019s \nestate, n ot taking bereavement days, not eating, not taking time for bathroom breaks.\u201d  ( Id. at \n286)  Her feelings of sadness, anxiety and apprehension had worsened; she frequently experienced difficulty concentrating  and had episodes of trembling and shaking assoc iated with \nanxiety .  (Id.)  She was making \u201cserious mistakes\u201d at work and was advised to refrain from \nworking for four weeks.  ( Id.)  On December 5, 2017, Roberts seemed \u201cworse\u201d with more \nintense and frequent symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and depression.  ( Id. at 289)  She \nreported having panic attacks and nightmares regarding work, as well as symptoms of PTSD .  \n(Id.)  During subsequent visits, Roberts regularly reported continuing panic attacks, which would \noccur when she talked about work or passed her employer\u2019s office , as well as nightmares \ninvolving work.  ( Id. at 292, 295, 299, 302, 305, 315)\n3  She also regularly reported continuing \nsymptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD  and/or ADHD.  ( Id. at 286, 289, 295, 299, 302, 305, \n308, 311, 315, 331, 335, 339)   \nMs. Hummel\u2019s progress notes frequently reflect certain  additional health issues that \nRoberts experienced relating to work.  For example, o n December 20, 2017, Roberts reported \nthat when she reviewed her e-mails, her blood pressure would become elevated.  ( Id. at 292)  On \nApril 11, 2018, Roberts conveyed that she had anger issues regarding returning to work in light of how she had been treated there.  ( Id. at 305)  On May 10, 2018, she reported that while in \n \n3  On September 11, 2019, Roberts reported that the panic attacks had stopped (a t \nleast at that time) .  (Tr. at 331) 6 California with her son, he received an e- mail from Outlook  (the same e- mail service that her \nemployer used),  and this caused her to panic\u2014her face went numb and she became tearful and \nhad an \u201cout of body experience. \u201d  (Id. at 308)  During this visit, Roberts reported that she was \ndenied short- term disability and had received a termination letter as of May 7, 2018.  ( Id.)  An \nAugust 1, 2018 progress note refl ected that Roberts began to collect unemployment, was \n\u201cunstable and unimproved[,]\u201d and that the weekly requirement to apply for a job caused her \ndifficulty as it triggered a \u201creminder[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 311)  An August 21, 2018 message noted that \nRoberts had called Ms. Hummel\u2019s office \u201cvery distraught\u201d after receiving a call for a possible job offer that caused her to have a \u201csevere panic attack.\u201d  ( Id. at 314)  On October 17, 2018, \nRoberts reported that she had been \u201csleeping excessively\u201d and found concentrating \u201ceven more difficult.\u201d  ( Id. at 315)  On June 19, 2019, Roberts noted that she was starting to have \u201cmemories \nof work issues[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 335)\n4    \n \n4  Roberts also had periodic appointments at Internal Medicine of Dover, where she \nwould occasionally reference her mental health issues.  For example, during a November 7, 2017 \nvisit, Roberts reported that she was experiencing increased stress due to her mother\u2019s death in \nOctober of that year, and  due to taking over her co -worker\u2019s job at work.  ( Id. at 365)  On \nNovember 16, 2017, Roberts reiterated that she was \u201cunder a great deal of stress at work and at \nhome.\u201d  ( Id. at 362)  During a December 6, 2017 visit, Roberts noted that she was going on a \nCaribbean cruise the next day.  ( Id. at 359)  On February 28, 2018, Roberts saw Theresa P. Little, \nM.D., who described Roberts as a \u201cvery active woman\u201d who had a \u201cbreakdown\u201d at her job at the \nend of 2017, and also was dealing with problems with her brother following her mother\u2019s death.  \n(Id. at 356)  Dr. Little noted that Roberts \u201cfeels very stable at this point and is probably going to \nend up retiring since her husband is 75[\u2014]a lot older than she is and they want to travel around.  \nThey will probably get an RV.\u201d  ( Id.)  On November 8, 2018, Roberts reported that \u201cthey were \ntalking about her retiring but now she\u2019s not so sure she wants to do that but she has not been able \nto go back to work yet.\u201d  ( Id. at 353)  During a May 2, 2019 visit, Roberts reported that she had \n\u201ccut herself out of her depression and anxiety that she had\u201d after her mother \u2019s death  and that she \nhad decided to \u201cretire completely[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 350)  She was \u201cexcited\u201d because she was going to \nbe traveling by car across the western United States, followed by a trip to Iceland and a Danube \nriver cruise.  ( Id.)   7 A few of Ms. Hummel\u2019s  treatment notes  show  indications that Roberts was \u201cslightly \nimproved[,]\u201d ( id. at 295), or reflect that Roberts reported a lessening of grief symptoms, ( id. at \n302, 339), a slight improvement in concentration, ( id. at 305), fewer  feelings of sadness, ( id. at \n308), less difficulty with sleeping, ( id. at 339), or a decrease in the freq uency and intensity of her \nPTSD symptoms, ( id. at 331).  On June 19, 2019, Roberts reported that she had gone on a 2,500 \nmile driving trip out West.  ( Id. at 335)  On September 11, 2019, Roberts noted that she and her \nhusband had visited Germany and \u201chad a  good time\u201d but that she was \u201ctired.\u201d  ( Id. at 331)     \nIn December 2018, Roberts was referred to Sandra Dryer, LCSW  regarding Roberts\u2019 \nanxiety and stress .  (Id. at 445)  Roberts treated with Ms. Dryer bi -monthly or weekly as needed \nthrough late 2019.  ( Id. at 319)  Ms. Dryer\u2019s November 11, 2019 report (the \u201c November 2019 \nreport \u201d) indicated that w ith respect to Roberts\u2019 most recent prior j ob, she had kept trying to do \nthe work of two people until she was immobilized due to anxiety and panic attacks.  ( Id. at 445)   \nRoberts  also reported difficulty sleeping and con centrating .  (Id.)  Roberts\u2019 distress rendered her \n\u201cincapacitated to function at work.\u201d  ( Id.)  Moreover, t he death of Roberts\u2019 mother caused an \nintense sense of loss and a lack of desire to socialize.  ( Id. at 446)  The November 2019 report \nreflected that following nearly a year of therapy sessions, Roberts was still having difficulties \nwith panic attacks relating to her past employment , though the frequency and intensity had \nchanged , as Roberts was utilizing tools to try to get through them .  (Id. at 447)  Ms. Dryer\u2019s \nNovember 2019 report also indicated that Roberts was \u201cincreasing socialization[.]\u201d  ( Id.)   \n2.  Reports from Medical Professionals  \nOn December 19, 2018 and January 9, 2019, Ms. Dryer and Ms. Hummel, respectively,  \neach completed a Mental Residual Functional Capacity S tatement (\u201cMRFCS\u201d) regarding \nRoberts.  ( Id. at 319- 22, 326- 29)  Their opinions therein were similar.  Ms. Dryer assessed 8 Roberts as having acute stress d isorder, and Ms. Hummel assessed Roberts as suffering from \npanic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD  and major depressive disorder.  ( Id. at 319, \n326)  Both mental health providers answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question asking whether they  believed \nRobert s is \u201cunable to obtain and retain work in a competitive work environment, 8 hours per day, \n5 days per week\u201d due to her limitations.  ( Id. at 322, 329)  By way of further explanation, Ms. \nHummel wrote that Roberts has spent more than a year trying to resolv e her job -related PTSD \nand panic issues, but continued to \u201chave renewed, intense reactions and symptoms during the \nsmallest steps to return to the workforce\u201d  such as \u201cpanic attacks which are crippling in nature[,] \nchest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, confusion[,] tearfulness, inability to make decisions, trembling, numbness [and] tingling in extremities.\u201d   (Id. at 328- 29)  Both Ms. Dryer and Ms. \nHummel also indicated that as a result of Roberts\u2019 physical and mental limitations:  (1) Roberts would be precluded from performing a job in a competitive work environment for more than \n30% of an 8- hour work day, 5 days per week; ( 2) Roberts would likely be absent from work \nmore than 6 days per month; and (3) Roberts would be unable to complete an 8- hour work day, 5 \ndays per week more than 6 days per month.  ( Id. at 321, 328)  And for most categories listing \nmental abilities  relatin g to (1) understanding and memory; (2) sustained concentration and \nmemory; and (3) social interaction and adaptation, both Ms. Dryer and Ms. Hummel identified \nthe degree of Roberts\u2019 impairment as precluding performance for 15% or more of an 8 -hour \nwork day in most areas, including \u201c[m]aintain attention and concentration for extended periods \nof time[,]\u201d \u201c[m]ake simple work -related decisions\u201d and \u201c[a]ccept instructions and respond \nappropriately to criticism from supervisors[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 319- 21, 326- 28)  In these portions of her \nreport, Ms. Dryer hand -wrote in that all of these types of tasks were \u201coverwhelming\u201d to Roberts.  \n(Id. at 320- 21)   9 On December 3, 2018, a state agency psychological consultant, Christopher King, PsyD, \ncompleted a Disability Determination Explanation based on his review of Roberts\u2019 mental health \ntreatment records.  ( Id. at 74 -78)  Dr. King noted that Roberts suffers from the severe \nimpairments of anxiety and depression.  ( Id. at 75)  He  found that Roberts\u2019 abilities to interact \nwith others or with the general public, and her ability to accept instructions and respond \nappropriately to criticism from supervisors, were \u201c[m]oderate[ ly]\u201d limited .  (Id. at 76-77)  Dr. \nKing also concluded that Roberts\u2019 ability to concentrate, persist, or maintain pace was \n\u201c[m]ild[ly]\u201d limited  and that otherwise, Roberts was not significantly limited with regard to her \nmental health or social interaction abilities .  (Id.)  He concluded that Roberts \u201cappears capable of \nwork in a more solitary environment.\u201d  ( Id. at 75 ; see also id . at 77)  In deeming Roberts\u2019 \nasses sment of her own symptoms and functional limitations to be \u201c[p]artially consistent[,] \u201d Dr. \nKing wrote that the totality of the objective medical evidence did not fully substantiate certain of \nRoberts\u2019 assertions given that:  (1) Roberts had not been psychiatrically hospitalized; ( 2) her \ncognitive functioning has remained grossly intact ove r time; and ( 3) recent follow -up notes from \nher treatment provider document \u201cgenerally intact mental status.\u201d  ( Id. at 76 -77)    \n3.  The Administrative Hearing  \nAt the administrative hearing  held  on December 17, 2019, the ALJ heard Roberts\u2019  \ntestimony and that of Vanessa Ennis, an impartial Vocational Expert (\u201cVE\u201d).  ( Id. at 29-72) \na. Roberts\u2019 T estimony  \nAt the hearing, Roberts first discuss ed her work history.  ( Id. at 34-42)  She explained \nthat she was most recently employed as a senior industrial engineer at Edgewell Personal Care \n(\u201cEdgewell\u201d) from approximately January 2016 until November 2017.  ( Id. at 34)  In that role, \nRoberts assisted with the labor standards for large machines that had been brought to  Edgewell\u2019s  10 Dover, Delaware location from Canada , and she also helped with costing products.  ( Id. at 34 -35)  \nFrom 2011 through 2015, Roberts was employed at Tiger Optics and its sister company as a \ncontinuous improvement manager.  ( Id. at 37, 42)  She \u201cwore a ton of hats there[,]\u201d including \nworking on their bills of materials  and helping with sourcing vendors, working with inventory, \nhelping with the purchasing department, and working with s hipping and receiving.  ( Id. at 37 -38)  \nPrior to that, from 2000 through 2009, Roberts worked for Mars Fish Care North America as an \nindustrial engineer.  ( Id. at 36 -37)  In this position, Roberts was mostly on her feet in the factory, \nother than times when she would work at her desk on analysis and computer spreadsheets.  ( Id. at \n39)     \nQuestioning t hen turned to Roberts\u2019 mental health and work- related issues.  (Id. at 44)  \nRoberts testified that she was treating with a therapist and was taking medication f or anxiety, \nADHD and PTSD.  ( Id.)  She explained that she has problems with panic attacks a nd has \nflashbacks regarding work when she hears the computer \u201c ding\u201d  due to receipt of an Outlook e -\nmail.  ( Id.)  \nWith respect to her most recent position as a senior industrial engineer  at Edgewell , \nRobert s reiterated that when she was hired, she worked with several brand new machines relating \nto sanitary napkins , pads and liners.  ( Id. at 45)  At that time, the company also employed another \nsenior industrial engineer who had been there for approximately 10 years ; this engineer handled \nmachines tied to the company\u2019s tampon business.  ( Id.)  Roberts and this  other senior industrial \nengineer did not work together on projects or understand e ach other\u2019s machines.  ( Id.)  By mid -\n2017, Roberts\u2019 mother was in poor health; Roberts had told the company that  she would be in \nand out of the office  as a result .  (Id. at 45 -46)  But one week before Roberts\u2019 mother died, \nEdgewell fired the other senior industrial engineer, and Roberts was told that she  would be doing 11 all of his work as well as her own work.  ( Id. at 46)  Roberts felt that this was \u201cnuts\u201d and that it \nwas impossible for a human to do all of  this work, especially because at that time she was also \nheavil y involved in teaching employees how to use a new computer program to assist with \nquality checks.  ( Id. at 46 -47)  During the  time period  after her mother\u2019s death , Roberts had \nrecurring dream s in which she was dead under her office desk and no one would find her .  (Id. at \n47)  She was also having difficulties with her  brother , who would call and harass her at work.  \n(Id. at 47 -48)  In light of all of this, Roberts lasted \u201cfor about a month after [her] mom died[, ]\u201d \nuntil one day when she had a \u201c full-blown panic attack \u201d at work .  (Id. at 47)  During the panic \nattack, her chest and head hurt, her lips were numb, and she was screaming and crying and \nthought she was dying.  ( Id.)  Between the death of her mother, the added responsibilities of her \nfired co -worker\u2019s position, and harassment from her brother, Roberts felt like she was in the \nmiddle of \u201ca perf ect storm.\u201d  ( Id. at 47 -48)  Roberts testified that it was still hard for her to focus \nand concentrate on things.  ( Id. at 48)   \nRoberts ne xt addressed her physical limitations , as well as her daily life a t home .  She \nexplained that she is able to cook and do dishes, shari ng responsibilities with her husband.  ( Id. at \n49-50)  Roberts is part of a small group of  women that meet weekly to knit, which is a huge \nstress reliever for her.  ( Id. at 50)  She further explained that Ms. Dryer encourages her to get out \nin nature , though she often just wished to stay in the house.  ( Id. at 50-51)   \nThe ALJ then questioned Roberts regarding her history of travel.  Roberts explained that \ntraveling and getting away from the area was her \u201csanity[,]\u201d along with knitting and her cat.  ( Id. \nat 51 )  Traveling and seeing new faces helps her to avoid \u201cgoing into the deep pits of \ndepression[,]\u201d though she noted that traveling was getting more stressful as it was hard to deal \nwith airports.  ( Id. at 51- 52)  Roberts referenced various trips that s he had taken, including a trip 12 to the Grand Canyon, a riverboat cruise to Europe, a nd a Caribbean cruise ; she noted that she \nalso had  an upcoming trip to Iceland planned w ith one of her sons and his wife.  ( Id.)   \nb. Vocational Expert\u2019s Testimony  \nVE Ennis  also testified during the hearing.  S he explained that she was aware of Roberts\u2019 \nprevious jobs.  ( Id. at 53)  She stated that most of Roberts \u2019 work would be considered to be \nskilled work as a n \u201c[i]ndustrial  [e]ngineer [;]\u201d these jobs  are typically performe d at the sedentary  \nlevel of  exertion (though Roberts r eported performing them  at light  and medium levels of \nexertion ) and are listed as Specific Vocational Preparation (\u201cSVP\u201d) Level 7  positions .  (Id. at 53-\n54)  Roberts\u2019 experience working at Tiger Optics was as a \u201c[q]uality [c]ontrol [m]anager\u201d ; it is a  \nskilled position performed at a light level of exertion and  listed as an SVP Level 8.  ( Id. at 54)   \nNext, the ALJ asked whether there were skills associated with Roberts\u2019 prior positions  \nthat would be transferrable , to which the VE responded in the negative , noting that Roberts\u2019 job \nand skills were \u201cvery specific.\u201d   (Id.)  Then the ALJ gave the VE a hypothetical:    \n[A]ssume an indi vidual who is able to perform light work, \nfrequently climb ramps and stairs, and never climb ladders, ropes \nor scaffolds, frequently balance, stoop and crouch, occasionally crawl and kneel, who is able to tolerate no more than occasional exposure to vibrat ions, and no exposure to hazards such as moving \nmachinery or unprotected heights.  Would such an individual be able to perform the claimant\u2019s past work?   \n (Id. at 54- 55)  The VE considered the se limitations  and noted that such an individual would not \nbe able to perform Roberts\u2019 past work because in that setting, \u201cthere is a lot of moving \nmachinery.\u201d  ( Id. at 55)  The A LJ later posed two more hypothetical s, for which she asked the \nVE to \u201cset[] aside . . . the hazards limitation\u201d :   \nFor the second hypothetical, please assume that the individual \ncould perform work at all exertional levels, and the individual is 13 able to interact with the public no more than  occasionally.  Would \nsuch an individual be able to perfor m the claimant\u2019s past work?   \n \n[and]  \n \n[P]lease return to the first hypothetical that I asked with all the \nother limitations at the sedentary exertional level .  And please \nassume that in addition to those exertional limitations at sedentary, \nthe individual also could have no more than occasional interaction with the public. . . .  Would such an individual be able to perform the claimant\u2019s past work?    \n(Id. at 55 -56, 57)  The VE responded that with regard to these hypothetical scenarios, the person \ncould do Roberts\u2019 past job as an industrial engineer , because in th ese positions  she is not \ninteracting with the public, but instead with people within her own organization.  ( Id. at 55 , 58)  \nThe ALJ then posed a final hypothetical:  \n[Assume that] the hypothetical individual [was] at the sedentary \nexertional level. . . . Could occasionally climb ramps and stairs, never climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds, occasionally balance, \nstoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, tolerate no more than occasional exposure to vibra tions . . . . And, if the individual could frequently \nfinger, handle and reach bilaterally. . . . [ i]f the individual could \nfrequently interact with supervisors and coworkers, but only occasionally work in tandem with others or directly with others, and onl y occasionally interact with the public, would such an \nindividual be able to perform the claimant\u2019s past work?  \n (Id. at 60)  The VE  first responded that yes , such an individual would be able to perform \nRoberts\u2019 past work as it is generally performed, and a s Roberts actually performed it .  (Id. at 60, \n62)  She then explained that with respect to interaction in the industrial engineer position, it is \nboth a \u201cgroup effort\u201d and an \u201cindividual effort\u201d ; the employee must \u201cput all [ of the] information \ntogether\u201d but must also \u201cwork around other people as far as going on the line to find out exactly \nhow they\u2019re doing things and then analyzing what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not working.  So you do . . . have to be\u201d in \u201cfrequent\u201d \u201ccollaboration with other people.\u201d  ( Id. at 66 -67)  The VE then 14 seemed to say that if the relevant \u201climitation was occasionally working\u201d in collaboration with \nothers, then the person would not  be able to do Roberts\u2019 past work.  ( Id. at 68)5  She concluded \nby confirming that her testimony was \u201cconsistent with the Dictionary of Occupational Titles \u201d \nand that she also \u201c incorporated collaboration [.]\u201d  (Id. at 69-70 (emphasis in original))     \n4.  The ALJ\u2019s Findings  \nOn February 6, 2020, the ALJ issued  the decision, which included the following seven  \nfindings: \n1.  The claimant meets the insured status requirements of the \nSocial Security Act through June 30, 2022.   2.  The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since November 6, 2017, the alleged onset date (20 CFR 404.1571 et seq .). . . .  \n 3.  The claimant has the following severe impairments:  bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, degenerative joint disease of right AC, and right hand status- post breakage (20 CFR 404.1520(c)).  . . .  \n 4.  The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals the seve rity of one of \nthe listed impairments in 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(d), 404.1525 and  404.1526). . . .  \n 5.  After careful consideration of the entire record, the [ALJ] finds that the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except she can frequently climb ramps and stairs  and occasionally climb ladders, \nropes, and  scaffolds; she can frequently balance, stoop, and crouch  \nand occasionally kneel and crawl; she can tolerate  occasional \nexposure to extreme cold, extreme heat, humidity, noise, vibrations, fumes, odors, dusts, gases, poor ventilation, and hazards  \n \n5  This portion of the hearing transcri pt is a bit difficult to de cipher.  In part that is \ndue to the number of different hypotheticals that were posed to the VE and because of the \ndifferent answers that the VE provided to those hypotheticals.  I n part it is also due to the fact \nthat during this portion of the hearing, it appears that the ALJ, the VE, Roberts\u2019 attorney  and/or \nRoberts were occasionally  speaking at the same time.  (Tr. at 59 -69) 15 such as moving machinery or unprotected heights; and she can \nfrequently finger, handle, and reach. . . .  \n 6.  The claimant is capable of performing past relevant work as an industrial engineer.  This work does not require the performance of \nwork -related activities precluded by the claimant\u2019s residual \nfunctional capacity (20 CFR 404.1565). . . .  \n \n7.  The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security Act, from November 6, 2017, through the date of this decision (20 CFR 404.1520(f)).  \n \n(Id. at 17- 23 (emphasis omitted) )  The relevant additional content of the ALJ\u2019s decision will be \ndiscussed in greater detail below. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA.  Motion for Summary Judgment  \nBoth parties filed motions for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 56.  \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  In determining the appropriateness of summary judgment, the Court \nmust \u201creview the record as a whole, \u2018draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of the non -\nmoving party\u2019 but not weighing the evidence or making credibility determinations.\u201d  Hill v. City of Scranton, 411 F.3d 118, 124- 25 (3d Cir. 2005) (alteration in original) (quoting Reeves v. \nSanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000)).   \nB.  Review of the ALJ\u2019s Findings  \nThe Court must uphold the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by \n\u201csubstantial evidence [.]\u201d  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Knepp v. Apfel , 204 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir. \n2000).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d m ay be  less than a preponderance of the evidence but  must  be \nmore than a mere scintilla of evidence; it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might 16 accept as adequate to support a conclusion [.]\u201d  Rutherford v. Barnhart , 399 F.3d 546, 552 (3d \nCir. 2005) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In analyzing whether substantial \nevidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings, the Court may not undertake a de novo \nreview of the Commissioner\u2019s decision and may not re -weigh the evidence of record.  See \nMonsour Med. Ctr. v. Heckler , 806 F.2d 1185, 1190- 91 (3d Cir. 1986).  Even if the reviewing \nCourt would have decided the factual inquiry differently, it must defer to t he ALJ and affirm the \nCommissioner\u2019s decision, so long as the decision is supported by substantial evidence.  Hartranft v. Apfel , 181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir. 1999); Monsour , 806 F.2d at 1190- 91. \n In addition to conducting an inquiry into whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s \ndetermination, the Court must also review the ALJ\u2019s decision to  determin e whether the correct \nlegal standards were applied.  Bierley v. Barnhart , 188 F. App\u2019x 117, 119 (3d Cir. 2006).  The \nCourt\u2019s review of legal issues is plenary.  Sykes v. Apfel , 228 F.3d 259, 262 (3d Cir. 2000) . \nIII.  DISCUSSION  \nIn resolving the instant motions, the Court will first  summarize  the relevant law regarding \nthe disability determination process .  It will then go on to assess Roberts\u2019 arguments on appeal.  \nA.  Disability  Determination Process  \n  Title II of the SSA  \u201cprovides for the payment of insurance benefits to persons who have \ncontributed to the program and who suffer from a physical or mental disability.\u201d  Bowen v. Yuckert , 482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987).  T o qualify for DIB benefits, the claimant must establish tha t \nhe or she was disabled prior to the date last insured.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.131;  Matullo v. Bowen, 926 \nF.2d 240, 244 (3d Cir. 1990).  A \u201cdisability\u201d is defined for purposes of DIB as the inability \u201cto \nengage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of a ny medically determinable physical or \nmental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be 17 expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months [.]\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A);  \nsee also  Tate  v. Berryhill , C.A. No. 15- 604-LPS, 2017 WL 1164525, at *5  (D. Del. Mar. 28, \n2017) .  A claimant is disabled \u201c only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of \nsuch severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, \neducation, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy[ .]\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A);  see also Barnhart v. Thomas , 540 \nU.S. 20, 21- 22 (2003) ; Tate , 2017 WL 1164525, at *5.   \nIn determining whether a person is disabled, the Commissioner is required to perform a \nfive-step sequential analysis.  See 20 C.F.R \u00a7 404.1520; see also Russo v. Astrue , 421 F. App\u2019x \n184, 188 (3d Cir. 2011).  If a finding of disabi lity or non- disability can be made at any point in \nthe sequential process, the Commissioner will not review the claim further.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4).  \n At step one, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant is engaged in \nsubstantial gai nful activity.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i) (mandating a finding of non- disability \nwhen claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity).  If the claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful activity, step two requires the Commissioner to determine  whether the \nclaimant is suffering from a severe impairment or a combination of impairments that is severe.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii) (mandating a finding of non- disability when claimant\u2019s \nimpairments are not severe).  If the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, then the Commissioner proceeds to step three and must compare the claimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments (the \u201clistings\u201d) that are presumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n404.1520(a)(4)(iii) ; Plummer v. Apfel , 186 F.3d 422, 428 (3d Cir. 1999).  When a claimant\u2019s \nimpairment meets or equals an impairment in the listings, the claimant is presumed disabled.  See  18 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii).  If a claimant\u2019s impairment fails to meet or medically equal any \nlisting, the Commissioner should proceed to steps four and five.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e).  \n At step four, the Commissioner dete rmines whether the claimant retains the residual \nfunctional capacity (or \u201cRFC\u201d) to perform  his or her past relevant work.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n404.1520(a)(4)(iv) (stating that a claimant is not disabled if he or she is able to return to past relevant work) ; Plumme r, 186 F.3d at 428.  A claimant\u2019s RFC is \u201cthat which an individual is still \nable to do despite the limitations caused by his or her impairment(s).\u201d  Johnson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 529 F.3d 198, 201 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omi tted).  \n\u201cThe claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to her past relevant work.\u201d  Plummer , 186 F.3d at 428. \n If the claimant is unable to return to his or her past relevant work, step five requires the \nCommissioner to determine wh ether the claimant\u2019s impairments preclude him or her from \nadjusting to any other available work.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4 )(v) & (g) (mandating a finding \nof non- disability when the claimant can adjust to other work and a finding of disability when the \nclaimant cannot do so) ; Plummer , 186 F.3d at 428.  At this last step, the burden of production is \non the Commissioner to show that the claimant is capable of performing other available work before denying disability be nefits.  Plummer , 186 F.3d at 428.  In other words, the ALJ must \nshow that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments, age, education, past work expe rience, and  [RFC] .\u201d  Id.  When making this determination, the ALJ must analyze the \ncumulative effect of all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.  Id.   At this step, the ALJ often seeks the \nassistance of a VE (as the ALJ did here) .  Id. \nB.  Roberts\u2019 Arguments on Appeal  19 On appeal, Roberts takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination  at step four, which did \nnot include any mental health -related  limitations .  (D.I. 14 at 1, 9-20)  Specifically, Roberts \ncontends that the R FC determination wa s not supported by substantial evidence because :  (1) the \nALJ improperly rejected the medical opinion evidence, which indicated that there were  \nsignificant limitations in  Roberts\u2019 mental functio ning capacity ; and (2) the RFC disregards the \nALJ\u2019s own  findings indicating  that Roberts did, in fact, suffer from at least \u201cmild\u201d mental health -\nrelated  limitations.  ( Id. at 9-20; D.I. 17 at 2-4)  For the reasons discussed below, the Court \nconcludes that  Roberts\u2019 first argument\u2014i.e., that the ALJ\u2019s errors in assessing the medical \nopinion evidence when formulating the RFC require reversal \u2014is well taken (and that the Court \ntherefore need not address Roberts\u2019 second argument).  See, e.g., Hand v. Kija kazi, CIVIL \nACTION NO. 3:21 -CV-00617, 2022 WL 3701625, at *8 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 26, 2022) (concluding \nthat the ALJ\u2019s decision must be vacated based on his failure to consider certain impairments and \ndeclining to address the plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments, which could be futile \u201cgiven that the ALJ\u2019s reconsideration of the RFC may yield a different result\u201d).    \nAn RFC is \u201can assessment of an individual\u2019s ability to do sustained work- related physical \nand mental activities in a work setting on a regular and continuing basis.  A \u2018regular and \ncontinuing basis\u2019 means 8 hours a day, for 5 days a week, or an equivalent work schedule.\u201d  SSR \n96-8p, 1996 WL 374184, at *1 (July 2, 1996); Ford v. Colvin, C.A. No.: 1:14- CV-01046- RGA, \n2015 WL 4608136, at *7 (D. Del. July 31, 2015).  A claimant\u2019s RFC measures the most  that the \nclaimant can do despite her mental and physical limitations.   Zirnsak v. Colvin , 777 F.3d 607, \n611 (3d Cir. 2014); see also  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1).  The ALJ is required to formulate the \nclaimant\u2019s RFC based on \u201call of the relevant medical and other evidence.\u201d  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n404.1545(a)(3).    20 Because the claim at issue here was filed after March 27, 2017, the ALJ did not need to \ndefer to or give any specific evidentiary weight (including controlling weight) to any medical \nopinion, including opinions from Roberts\u2019 medical sources like Ms. Dryer or Ms. Hummel.  See 20 C.F.R \u00a7 404.1520c; see also  Jones v. Kijakazi , Civil Action No. 20-1074-SRF, 2022 WL \n1016610, at *8 (D. Del. Apr. 5, 2022).  Instead, the ALJ must consider the persuasiveness of all medical opinions and prior administrative medical findings\n6 based on the application of five \nfactors:  (1) supportability; (2) consistency; (3) relationship with the claimant; (4) specialization; and (5) other factors that tend to support or contradict the opinion.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(c);  \nWeidner v. Kijakazi , Civil Action No. 20-1250-MN, 2022 WL 610702, at *11 (D. Del. Feb. 1, \n2022), report and recommendation adopted, 2022 WL 610678 (D. Del. Feb. 16, 2022).  \u201cThe ALJ must explain how [s]he considered the most important factors of supportability and consistency.\u201d  Weidner , 2022 WL 610702, at *11 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2)).  \n\u201cConsistency concerns the degree to which the opinion r eflects the same limitations described in \nevidence from other sources, whereas supportability concerns the relevancy of objective medical evidence and degree of explanation given by the medical source to support the limitations assessed in the opinion.\u201d  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \nHere,  all opinions of record\u2014the medical opinions of Ms. Dryer and Ms. Hummel, as \nwell as Dr. King\u2019s prior administrative medical finding \u2014determined that Roberts had certain \nlimitations in her mental functioning capacity.  All three opined that Roberts was limited in her \nability to interact with others .  (Tr. at 76-77, 320-21, 327)  And all three opined that Roberts had \n \n6  The regulations define \u201cfinding[s] . . . about a medical issue made by [the \nCommissioner\u2019s ] Federal and State agency medical and psychological consultants at a prior level \nof review . . . based on their review of the evidence in [the claimant\u2019s] case record\u201d as \u201cprior \nadministrative medical finding[s].\u201d  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a)(5).   21 a limitation in concentration, persisting and maintaining  pace.  ( Id. at 76, 320, 327)  The Court \nagain briefly summarizes the se providers\u2019 conclusions\u2014and the ALJ\u2019s assessment of th ose \nconclusions\u2014below. \nMs. Dryer determined that Roberts was a \u201cCategory IV \u201d (the highest listed level of \ninfirmity, which precludes performance of a task for 15% or more of an 8-hour work day) with \nrespect to  nearly every possible mental ability referenced on the MRFCS .  (Id. at 320-21)  These \nsevere limitations related to areas such as the ability to interact with others and accept criticism \nfrom supervisors, the ability to maintain concentration, the ability to sustain an ordinary routine \nwithout special supervision, and the ability to perform at a consistence pace.  ( Id.)  However, in \nher decision, the ALJ concluded that Ms. Dryer\u2019s opinion was not persuasive.  This was because:  \n(1) Ms. Dryer based these limitations , in part, on Roberts\u2019 subjective statements regarding her \nown limitations; and (2) th ose limitations are not supported by the record.  ( Id. at 22)  With \nrespect t o the record, the ALJ pointed to the fact that Roberts\u2019  examinations show ed \u201cintact \ncognitive functioning, cooperative and appropriate behavior, and ability to abstract and do \narithmetic calculations [,]\u201d as well as the fact that Roberts had the ability to travel frequently and \nmostly abroad.  ( Id.)  The ALJ noted that notwithstanding Roberts\u2019 \u201c impairments or any \nabnormalities seen on mental status exam . . . . [Roberts\u2019] ability to travel to such a degree does \nnot suggest severe mental impairment.\u201d  ( Id.)   \nAs for Ms. Hummel, she c oncluded that Roberts was similarly limited \u2014i.e., that Roberts \nwas a Category IV and had severe limitations regarding nearly every mental ability listed on the \nMRFCS .  (Id. at 327-28)  Ms. Hummel noted that Roberts continued to have \u201crenewed, intense\u201d \nsymptoms when engaging in the \u201c smallest steps to return to the workforce [,]\u201d such as job \ninterviews.  ( Id. at 329)  The ALJ , however, wrote in her decision that she \u201cdoes not find Ms. 22 Humme l\u2019s opinion su pported by her explanation, which focuses on the claimant\u2019s increased \nsymptoms and decompensation when work[-] related activities arise[.]\u201d   (Id. at 22)  The ALJ \nfurther stated that M s. Hummel\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with the record, for th e same reasons \nas described above with respect to Ms. Dryer\u2019s opinion.  ( Id. at 22 -23)   \nLastly, with regard to Dr. King , he concluded that Roberts had moderate limitations when \nit came to :  (1) interaction with others /the general public; and (2) the ability to accept instructions \nand respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors.  ( Id. at 76 -77)  In support of this \ndetermination, Dr. King noted Roberts\u2019 \u201chistory of anxiety symptoms and problematic \nrelationships[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 77)  Dr. King further found that Roberts\u2019 impairments \u201cimpact her ability \nto concentrate[,] \u201d such that she was mildly limited with respect to concentration, persistence, and \nmaintaining pace.  ( Id. at 75 -76)  The ALJ , in turn, found that the portion of Dr. King\u2019s opinion \nregarding Roberts\u2019 social interaction limitations was \u201cnot persuasive\u201d because:  (1) it was \u201cnot \nwell supported by [Dr. King\u2019s] explanation, which seems to focus on the claimant\u2019s having \nresidual anxiety symptoms\u201d; and (2) it was  \u201cinconsistent [ with Robe rts\u2019] activities of daily \nliving [,]\u201d in that Roberts had been able to travel frequently and participat e in a weekly knitting \ngroup.  ( Id. at 22)  However, the ALJ found the remainder of Dr. King\u2019s opinion to be persuasive \nand well -supported, in light of Roberts\u2019 generally \u201cintact cognitive functioning and behavior on \nexam,  no reported problems with personal care, and generally favorable response to treatment [in \nthat Roberts reported] feeling stable and [had the] ability to travel often and mostly abroad.\u201d  \n(Id.) \nHaving set out the relevant record, the Court now turns to the merits of Roberts \u2019 \nargument.  Roberts asserts that the ALJ \u2019s dismissal of Ms. Hummel \u2019s and Ms. Dryer \u2019s 23 opinions\u2014as well as certain portions of Dr. King\u2019s opinion\u2014in formulating the RFC wa s not \nsupported by substantial evidence.   \nThe Court agrees with Roberts that the ALJ\u2019s reasons  for rejectin g the medical opinions \nof Ms. Dryer and Ms. Hummel (and certain portions of Dr. King\u2019s opinion) at step four\u2014\nwhether assessed individually or taken together\u2014amount to reversable error.  There are at least \nfour problems with the ALJ\u2019s decision in thi s regard .   \nFirst, in rejecting the opinions of Ms. Dryer and Ms. Hummel, the ALJ  utilized the \nproviders\u2019 treatment notes in a manner that ignored how \u201cthe work environment is completely \ndifferent from home or a mental health clinic[.]\u201d  Morales v. Apfel , 225 F.3d 310, 319 (3d Cir. \n2000).  In coming to her RFC decision, t he ALJ signific antly relied on the fact that during \nRoberts\u2019 therapeutic examinations, Roberts exhibited certain positive  mental health -related  \ntraits \u2014i.e., she showed \u201cintact cognitive functioning, cooperative and appropriate behavior and \n[the] ability to abstract and d o arithmetic calculations[.]\u201d  (Tr. at 22 -23)  But the ALJ failed to \nexplain why  these observations about Roberts\u2019 behavior and math skills , as exhibited in a \ntherapist\u2019s office , suggest that Roberts had the ability to handle the stresses of her  past \nworkplace .  (D.I. 14 at 14; D.I. 17 at 3-4)  Such an explanation is warranted here, where Ms. \nDryer and Ms. Hummel both opined that Roberts\u2019 mental health issues are largely related to \nwork .  (Tr. at 329, 447; see also D.I. 14 at 15)7  It is typically  improper for an ALJ to supplant a \n \n7  To be m ore specific, as stated  above, the ALJ noted that Roberts exhibited \u201c intact \ncognitive functioning, cooperative and appropriate behavior and [the] ability to abstract and do \narithmetic calculations\u201d  during therapy sessions with Ms. Dryer and Ms. Hummel.  (Tr. at 22-23)  \nBut Ms. Dryer and Ms. Hummel had repeatedly concluded that, when it came to functioning in a \nwork setting , Roberts had an \u201coverwhelming\u201d inability to exhibit appropriate behavior or to \nmake use of her memory or concentration abilities, ( id. at 320), and that any improvement that \nRoberts had exhibited \u201cdecompensates when any work[- ]related activities arise\u201d because her \nwork caused her panic attacks, the inability to make decisions and various harmful physical 24 provider\u2019s opinion about a claimant\u2019s ability to function in the workplace with \u201can inference \ngleaned from treatment records reporting on the claimant in an environment absent of the \nstresses that accompany the work setting.\u201d  Morales , 225 F.3d at  319; see also Brownawell v. \nComm\u2019r of Social Sec ., 554 F.3d 352, 356 (3d Cir. 2008) (concluding that an ALJ wrongfully \ndiscredited  a treating physician\u2019s findings as to the claimant\u2019s inability to maintain attention or \nconcentration in the workplace; while the ALJ relied upon the fact that a treatment note cited the \nclaimant\u2019s \u201cgood focus, good attention, and good concentration[,]\u201d this was inappropriate, as \n\u201cthis Court has admonished ALJs who have used such reasoning, noting the distinction between \na doctor\u2019s notes for purposes of treatment and that doctor\u2019s ultimate opinion on the claimant\u2019s \nability to work\u201d ); Bazewicz v. Kijakazi , CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:21 -cv-00504, 2022 WL \n4357480, at *7 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 20, 2022) (finding that the \u201cALJ\u2019s mention of the plaintiff having \nsome normal mental status upon examination[,]\u201d inter alia , did not constitute substantial \nevidence to justify the ALJ\u2019 s rejection of marked and extreme limitations in the medical \nopinions , as \u201c[e]vidence of a plaintiff\u2019s behavior and abilities at home or during medical \nappointments is considered poor evidence of a plaintiff\u2019s abilities and behaviors under the stress \nof the workplace\u201d) ; Copes v.  Berryhill , CIVIL ACTION NO. 16-5735, 2019 WL 1455443, at *4 \n(E.D. Pa. Apr. 1, 2019).    \n Second , and relatedly, although the ALJ cited to the above- referenced positive \ntherapeutic findings described in Ms. Dryer\u2019s and Ms. Hummel\u2019s treatment notes, the ALJ failed \nto substantively discuss the  many  negative  clinical observations found in those same records.  \n \nsymptoms, ( id. at 328-29).  Pursuant to the applicable precedent  set out herein , the ALJ would \nhave at least needed to explain why she concluded that certain positive behaviors that Roberts \nexhibited in a therapeutic setting  would have been likely to carry over to a work setting \u2014\nespecially in light of Ms. Dryer\u2019s and Ms. Hummel\u2019s emphatic conclusions to the contrary. 25 Ms. Dryer\u2019s and Ms. Hummel\u2019s opinions regarding Roberts\u2019 mental RFC  were based on , inter \nalia, their regular treatment of Roberts (Ms. Dryer for nearly a year and Ms. Hummel for many \nyears) .  (Tr. at  322, 329)  Ms. Dryer\u2019s November 2019 report notes that after the use of a clinical \ninterview and screening tools, Roberts exhibited specific symptoms of anxiety, PTSD and grief \nand loss.  ( Id. at 445- 46)  Similarly, Ms. Hummel\u2019s notes consistently reflect that , upon \nexamination, Roberts was experiencing many abnormalities in terms of her ability to interact \nappropriately and think clearly, such as  crying or near crying, distractedness,  extreme anxiety \nand depression.  ( Id. at 287, 290, 293, 296, 300, 303, 306, 309, 312, 316, 331-32, 336, 340)  Yet \nin her decision, other than vaguely noting that there were \u201cabnormalities seen on [Roberts\u2019] \nmental status exam [,]\u201d the ALJ never really confronted or discuss ed any of these negative \nclinical findings in detail.  ( Id. at 22 -23)  An ALJ must consider all  relevant evidence\u2014including \n\u201cmedical records, observations made during formal medical examinations, descriptions of \nlimitations by the claimant and others, and observations of the claimant\u2019s limitations by \nothers\u201d\u2014when crafting an RFC.  Fargnoli v. Massanari , 247 F.3d 34, 41 (3d Cir. 2001).  In \nfailing to substantively  engage with the above- referenced  negative clinical observations and \nfindings, the ALJ rendered it unclear whether she considered any such evidence when  \ndetermining Roberts\u2019 RFC (and if so, why she discounted it).  This is another reason why the \nALJ erred i n her RFC determination  process .  See Blackman  v. Kijakazi , \u2014 F. Supp. 3d \u2014, 2022 \nWL 2791746, at *13 (E.D. Pa. July 15, 2022) (explaining that a \u201cfailure to discuss negative \nfindings, while relying upon positive findings, is a classic \u2018cherry pick,\u2019 and an inappropriate \nbasis upon which to wholesale reject a medical opinion[,]\u201d and noting that the ALJ\u2019s \u201c failure to \ngrapple with evidence that contradicts the ALJ\u2019s findings leaves [the Co urt] unable to perform a 26 meaningful review of the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d) ; see also  Maximiliano  L. v. Kijakazi, Case No. 3:21-\ncv-0083, 2022 WL 4550631, at *8 (D.N.J. Sept. 29, 2022) (same) .  \nThird, the ALJ fail ed to sufficiently explain how the fact that Roberts was able to travel \noften (including abroad)8 was indicative of her ability to do her past relevant work , or why it \notherwise means that Roberts  did not have any mental- health -related limitations impacting her \nRFC .  (D.I. 14 at 15; D.I. 17 at 3)  Ms. Dryer encouraged Roberts to  socialize and get out of the \nhouse, and Roberts described traveling and getting away from her environment as her \u201csanity.\u201d  \n(Tr. at 50-51, 446-47)  And Ms. Hummel\u2019s treatment notes reflect an awareness that Ro berts \nenjoyed travel, ( see id.  at 274, 308, 331, 335, 339), yet Ms. Hummel nevertheless opined that \nRoberts\u2019 mental limitations left her unab le to work in a competitive work environment, ( id. at \n327-29).  Further, in certain of the records, Ms. Hummel noted that after returning from travel, \nRoberts continued to experience anxiety and depression.  ( Id. at 331, 335)  While the Court does \nnot mean to suggest that a claimant\u2019s ability to engage in certain  social  activities (like travel) is \nirrelevant  to an ALJ\u2019s RFC determination ,9 the ALJ should provide some explanation as to how \nor why  such an ability \u201csupport[s] a conclusion that [the claimant] could therefore handle the \nrigors of 40-hour per week employment.\u201d  See Blackman , 2022 WL 2791746, at *17; Davis v. \nKijakazi , CIVIL ACTION NO. 20 -cv-04867- RAL, 2022 WL 1460356, at *7 (E.D. Pa. May 9, \n \n8  Roberts did travel quite a lot\u2014and to some fairly far-flung locales\u2014during the \nyears in question.  (D.I. 16 at 8 -9)  As was noted previously, these trips included a cruise to the \nCaribbean  in December 2017, travel across the western United States in May 2019, ( Tr. at 51-52, \n339, 350), a Danube river cruise in August 2019, ( id. at 343, 350, 352), and a trip to Iceland in \nDecember 2019, ( id. at 51 -52, 339).  \n \n9  Indeed,  it is \u201cappropriate for an ALJ to consider the number and type of activities \nin which a claimant engages when assessing his or her [RFC] .\u201d  Cunningham v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. \nSec., 507 F. App\u2019x 111, 118 (3d Cir. 2012).   \n 27 2022) ( assessing the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that a consultative psychologist\u2019s opinion was erroneous, \nwhere the psychologist found that the claimant had limitations i n her ability to interact \nappropriately with supervisors and to respond appropriately to work situations or to changes in \nroutine work settings; the court determined that the ALJ\u2019s decision was in error, because \u201cthe \nALJ presented no analysis concerning whether [the claimant\u2019s] engagement in [certain] daily \nactivities [like shopping or walking her dog] indeed indicates that she can perform effectively in \na work environment\u201d);  see also Smith v. Califano, 637 F.2d 968, 971 (3d Cir. 1981) (\u201cDisability \ndoes not mean that a claimant must vegetate in a dark room excluded from all forms of human \nand social activity. . . .  It is well established that sporadic or transitory activity does not disprove \ndisability.\u201d) .10  The failure to do so amounted to error here.  \nFourth, in determining that Roberts had only a \u201c mild\u201d limitation in terms of interacting \nwith others, the ALJ erred in reject ing all three medical opinions of record to the contrary.  (D.I. \n14 at 10, 17)  As described above, Dr. King found that Roberts had \u201c[m] oderate []\u201d limitations \nwith regard to interacting with others at work , and Ms. Dryer and Ms. Hummel concluded that \nRoberts had quite severe limitations in this area.  (Tr. at 22, 76-77, 320- 21, 327-28)  In \nsupporting her conclusion that Roberts had only a \u201cmild\u201d limitation in this regard, the ALJ \npointed to Roberts\u2019 frequent travel, to her participation in a weekly knitting group, and to the \n \n10  The Court notes that it could be (depending on circumstances of a particular case) \nthat if a person can  successfully travel to and from a distant foreign country, then the mental \nhealth -related skills that enabled the person to do so are the kinds of skills that would also allow \nthe perso n to handle the mental rigors of their past w orkplace.  But the Court\u2019s point here is that \nif an ALJ concludes that th is is so in a particular case, then in order for that conclusion to be \neffectively reviewed, the ALJ would have to provide more details than the Court has here .  What \ntypes of skills did the person actually utilize on her trips abroad?  How could those skills \ntranslate to the person\u2019s prior workplace?  Here, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion on this point is devoid of \nsuch details.     28 type of selective findings at Roberts\u2019 therapy appointments previously described above.  ( Id. at \n18)  However, an ALJ may reject a medical  opinion \u201conly on the basis of contradictory medical \nevidence and not due to his or her own credibility judgments, speculation or lay opinion.\u201d  \nMorales , 225 F.3d at  317-18 (explaining that \u201c[t]he principle that an ALJ should not substitute \nhis lay opinion for the medical opinion of experts is especially profound in a case involving a \nmental disability\u201d); Bazewicz , 2022 WL 4357480, at *6 (explaining that an ALJ \u201cis only \npermitted to disregard the treating physician\u2019s opinion (here, that the plaintiff had a marked \nlimitation in remembering and applying information), when the treating physician\u2019s opinion is \ninconsistent with other substantial evidence \u201d as an \u201cALJ\u2019s lay interpretation of the medical \nevidence i s not inconsistent substantial evidence\u201d) ; see also, e.g., Simpson v. Kijakazi , CIVIL \nNO.: 1 -20-CV-00275, 2021 WL 3869942, at *9-11 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 27, 2021) (concluding that it \nis error for an ALJ to reject medical opinion evidence in reliance on the ALJ\u2019s own lay opinion \neven under the new medical opinion regulations); Kenyon  v. Saul , Civil No.  1:20- CV-1372, 2021 \nWL 2015067, at *9 (M.D. Pa. May 19, 2021) ( same) .  Here, the ALJ rejected the opinions of \nevery medical professional of record on this point based on her lay opinion, which is error.      \n In sum, for the reasons described above, the Court cannot conclude that the ALJ\u2019s RFC \ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.  On remand, the ALJ should consider all of \nthe relevant, probative evidence in the record and provide a sufficient explanation in support of \nher RFC determination.  See, e.g., Siderias v.
