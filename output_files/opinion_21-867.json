ROBINSON, POSSUM \nHOLLER HAULIN\u2019, \nSOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, \nEDWARD D. MAURY  : \n: : : \n:  \n \nMEMORANDUM  \nKEARNEY, J.                 August 26, 2022 \n Delaware Law requires persons seeking damages for personal injuries caused by other \npersons to bring suit within two years of knowing of their injury. We today address a claim brought \nby two persons involved in an automobile accident allegedly involving a SEPTA bus. The persons \ndid not sue SEPTA and its driver until after the two -year statute of limitations. SEPTA and its \ndriver raised the defense of statute of limitations and the injured persons have not come forward \nwith grounds to excuse their untimely f iling of suit against SEPTA and its driver. We lack a basis \nto find the injured persons\u2019 claims against SEPTA and its driver may proceed based on the undisputed pleadings confirming the injured persons waited too long to sue SEPTA and its driver. \nWe grant SEPTA and its driver\u2019s Motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismiss them from the case.  \nI. Background \n Wife and husband Kelli Lyn and Matthew Eldreth sued Douglas Robinson and his \ncompany Possum Holler Haulin\u2019 in the Delaware Superior Court on May 5, 2021.\n1 The Eldreths \nclaimed Mr. Robinson negligently hit Ms. Eldreth\u2019s vehicle with his Possum Holler Haulin\u2019 2 \n vehicle on May 30, 2019.2 Mr. Robinson and Possum Holler Haulin\u2019 removed to our Court.3 The \nEldreths amended their Complaint to add negligence claims against Southeastern Pennsylvania \nTransportation Authority (SEPTA) and SEPTA driver Edward Maury on August 17, 2021.4 The \nEldreths claim Mr. Maury hit Ms. Eldreth\u2019s vehicle with a SEPTA vehicle on May 30, 2019.5  \n The Eldreths never served SEPTA o r Mr. Maury with their amended Complaint.6 SEPTA \nand Mr. Maury answered the amended Complaint on November 12, 2021.7 Chief Judge Chagares \nassigned the case to our docket on May 20, 2022.8 Discovery ended  August 22, 2022.9  \nII. Analysis  \n SEPTA and Mr. Maury move for judgment on the pleadings.10 They argue Delaware\u2019s two -\nyear statute of limitations for personal injury actions bars the Eldreths\u2019 claims. The Eldreths did \nnot respond.11 We grant SEPTA and Mr. Maury\u2019s motion because the face of the amended \nComplaint confirms the statute of limitation s bars the Eldreths\u2019 claims.  \n  Delaware maintains a two -year statute of limitations for personal injury  claims like \nnegligence .12 \u201cA party may raise a statute of limitations defense in a Rule 12(c) motion if its \napplication is apparent on the face of the complaint. \u201d13 We may grant a Rule 12(c) motion based \non the statute of limitations if \u201cno further factual record is required to be developed.\u201d14 \n We grant SEPTA and Mr. Maury\u2019s Motion because the untimeliness of the Eldreths\u2019 claims \nis apparent from the fa ce of their amended Complaint. \u201cDetermining whether a claim is time -\nbarred by a statute of limitations requires determining three things: (1) the date the cause of action \naccrued, (2) whether the cause of action has been tolled, and (3) if the cause of act ion has been \ntolled, whether and when Plaintiffs were placed on inquiry notice of their claims.\u201d15 The cause of \naction accrues when \u201cthe alleged wrongful  act\u201d occurs.16 The alleged wrongful act \u2014SEPTA and \nMr. Maury colliding with the Eldreths \u2014occurred on May 30, 2019. The Eldreths did not sue \nSEPTA and Mr. Maury until August 17, 2021\u2014more than two years after their accident. The 3 \n Eldreths do not plead or adduce facts allowing us to find a basis for tolling.  Delaware\u2019s two -year \nstatute of limitations bars the Eldreths\u2019 claims against SEPTA and Mr. Maury.  We grant the motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings.17 \n We recognize Federal Rule 15 often becomes relevant when, as here, the plaintiff timely \nsues some defendants then amends to untimely sue other defendants.18 If Rule 15(c) applies , \u201cthe \namended complaint is treated, for statute of limitations purposes, as if it had been filed at the time \nof the original complaint.\u201d19 An untimely amendment adding a party relates back under Rule 15(c) \nif:  \n1. The amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or \noccurrence set out \u2014or attempted to be set out \u2014in the original pleading; and  \n \n2. Within the ninety-day period provided by Rule 4(m)  for serving the summons and \ncomplaint, the party to be brought in by amendment :  \n \ni. Received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the \nmerits; and   \n \nii. Knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but \nfor a mistake concerning the prop er party \u2019s identity.20 \n \n We need not analyze Rule 15 today because the Eldreths do not invoke it. The \u201c[p] laintiff  \nbears the burden to demonstrate that an amendment relates back to the original Complaint under Rule 15(c) .\u201d\n21 The Eldreths did not respond to SEPTA and Mr. Maury\u2019s Motion. Discovery ended \non August 22, 2022, providing the Eldreths ample opportunity to dis cover facts relevant to SEPTA \nand Mr. Maury\u2019s notice of this action.22 But the Eldreths say nothing in response to SEPTA and \nMr. Maury\u2019s motion. The Eldreths do not carry their burden to show Rule 15 allows us to relate back their untimely amendment.\n23 \nIII. Conclusion  \n A wife and husband allegedly injured in a car accident  sued a transit company and its driver \nmore than two years after the accident occurred. The transit company and driver seek judgment 4 \n because the wife and husband sued after the statute of limitations expired. The wife and husband \ndo not carry their burden to show we should excuse their untimely lawsuit. We dismiss the wife \nand husband\u2019s claims  against the transit company and its driver .  \n \n \n1 D.I. 1- 1. \n2 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 4 \u20135.  \n3 D.I. 1.  \n4 D.I. 11.  \n5 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12 \u201314.  \n6 The Eldreths never filed an affidavit of service as required to prove service under Rule 4(l). We \nassume service never occurred.  \n7 D.I. 15. \n8 D.I. 27. \n9 D.I. 32 \u00b6 8. \n10 D.I. 43. A party may move for judgment \u201c[a]fter  the pleadings are closed \u2014but early enough not \nto delay trial.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). SEPTA and Mr. Maury\u2019s motion does not delay trial; they \nmoved weeks before pre- trial filings came due.  \n\u201cThe purpose of judgment on the pleadings is to dispose of claims where the material facts are undisputed and judgment can be entered on the competing pleadings and exhibits thereto, and documents incorporated by reference.\u201d Venetec Inter., Inc. v. Nexus Med., LLC , 541 F. Supp. 2d \n612, 617 (D. Del. 2008). We \u201cmust accept  the non- moving party\u2019s allegations as true, drawing all \nreasonable factual inferences in the non -movant\u2019s favor.\u201d Id. Motions for judgment on the \npleadings \u201cshould not be granted unless the moving party has established that there is no material issue of f act to resolve, and that it is entitled to judgment in its favor as a matter of law.\u201d D.E. v. \nCent. Dauphin Sch. Dist ., 765 F.3d 260, 271 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotations and citations \nomitted).   \n11 Our Local Rules require a party opposing a motion to r espond within fourteen days. D. Del.

We \nsee no indication SEPTA or Mr. Maury received notice of the Eldreths\u2019 suit within ninety days after the Eldreths sued in M ay 2021. The Eldreths never filed an affidavit of service, let alone an \naffidavit of service proving service within the ninety -day Rule 4(m) period ending on August 3, \n2021.
