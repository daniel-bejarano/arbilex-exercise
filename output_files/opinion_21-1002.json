MacGray, M ARKS , O\u2019N EILL, O\u2019B RIEN , \nDOHERTY & KELLY , P.C., Wilmington, Delaware . \n \nCounsel for Defendant s. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nNovember 15, 2021  \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nI may not enter judgment  against  defendants who have no connection  with Dela-\nware . Because Luxury Hotels International Management Co . B.V., is one such de-\nfendant , I must dismiss it from th is case.  \nTo celebrate their anniversary, Anna and Craig Tractenberg travelled to Venice. \nBut their celebrations were cut short . While leaving their hotel, the J.W. Ma rriott \nVenice Resort and Spa, Anna slipped and fell. Compl. , D.I. 1,  \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10.  She flew to the \nUnited States and was hospitalized with serious brain and knee injuries. Id.  \u00b6 17. \nSo the Tractenbergs sued the Netherlands company managing the hotel , Luxury , \nalong with its American parent, Marriott International, Inc. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 4\u20135. Anna charged \nboth companies with negligence. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 19\u201352. And Craig claimed loss of consortium . \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 53\u201356.  \nLuxury did not respond in time , so the Tractenbergs asked me to  enter default \njudgment. D.I. 12. Because Luxury is neither at home nor active in Delaware,  I asked \nthe Tract enbergs to explain why I ha ve personal jurisdiction over it . See Budget \nBlinds, Inc. v. White , 536 F.3d 244, 259 (3d Cir. 2008). They responded  that Luxury \nis controlled  by Marriott , which is  incorporated in Delaware . D.I. 17, at 1 \u20133 (citing \nShuker v. Smith & Nephew, PLC , 885 F.3d 760, 781 (3d Cir. 2018)).  \nTo decide personal jurisdiction , I look to Delaware law . Fed. R. Civ. P 4(k)(2). In \nDelaware, a plaintiff may drag a subsidiary into court along  with its parent if it is the \nalter ego or agent of the parent . Applied Biosystems, Inc. v. Cruachem, Ltd. , 772 F. \nSupp. 1458, 1463 (D. Del. 1991). But  neither theory gives me jurisdiction over Luxury.  3 If a parent is its  subsidiary\u2019s alter ego, a court may  \u201cignore the corporate bounda-\nries between parent and subsidiary if fraud or inequity is shown.\u201d Id.  Yet the Tract-\nenbergs do not allege fraud  or inequity . So this theory cannot help them.  \nNeither can their agency theory . True, we have jurisdiction over foreign parents  \nwhen they closely control Delaware subsidiaries. Id. That makes sense. If the parent \ndirects its Delaware subsidiary, it must have contact with Delaware. The parent\u2019s \nupstream actions els ewhere would flow downstream to Delaware. So the parent can-\nnot be surprised if it is forced to litigate here.  \nBut jurisdiction is a stream,  not a two -way street. We cannot travel from a Dela-\nware parent  to a foreign subsidiary . This case shows why. Suppose  Marriott (the Del-\naware parent) controls Luxury from an office in Italy. Luxury would lack any contact \nwith Delaware. Dragging it into Delaware court would \u201coffend traditional notions of \nfair play.\u201d Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310, 316 \u201317 (1945) . So I will not.  \nThe Tractenbergs push back  by noting that an alter ego  theory may justify juris-\ndiction over a subsidiary whe n its parent is at home  in Delaware . D.I. 17, at 3. But \nan alter ego theor y treat s the parent and subsidiary \u201cas a single enterpris e.\u201d Ranza \nv. Nike, Inc. , 793 F.3d 1059, 1072 (9th Cir. 2015). T he parent\u2019s contacts can be im-\nputed to its  subsidiary and vice versa. Id. That logic does not apply to the one- way \nstream  of a principal directing its agent , so alter ego theory ha s no bearing here.  \nThus, I deny the Tractenberg s\u2019 motion for default judgment against Luxury and \ndismiss all claims against it without prejudice. I also deny Luxury\u2019s motion to extend \nits time to respond as moot. But the claims against Marriott can proceed without 4 Luxury  because it is not a necessary party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a). I do not need it  to \nresolve claims brought only against Marriott. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  27\u201341, 53 \u201356. Likewise, I \ncan address vicarious or joint liability without Luxury. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 42\u201352; Lincoln Prop.  \nCo. v. Roche , 546 U.S. 81, 91 (2005); Am. Home Mortg. Corp. v. First Am. Title Ins. \nCo., 2007 WL  3349320, at *4 (D.N.J. Nov. 9, 2007). So I  let the claims against Marriott \nproceed.   \n  \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nANNA TRACTENBERG,  \nCRAIG TRACTENBERG  \n \nPlaintiffs , \n \nv. \n \nMARRIOTT  INTERNATIONAL,  INC.,  \nLUXURY  HOTELS  INTERNATIONAL  \nMANAGEMENT  COMPANY  B.V. \n \nDefendants . \n No. 1:21- cv-01002- SB \n \n \n  ORDER  \nNovember 15, 2021 \nI deny the  motion for default judgment [D.I. 12]  and DISMISS WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE  all claims against Luxury Hotels International, Inc.
