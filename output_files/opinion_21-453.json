Pinkus, Philip Zimmerly, B\nOSE MCKINNEY & EVANS LLP,  Indianapolis, In-\ndiana; Nicholas D. Mozal, P OTTER ANDERSON & CORROON , LLP, Wilmington, Dela-\nware.  \n \nCounsel for Defendant  Author Solutions, LLC  of Delaware  \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nFebruary  3, 2022  \n \n \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nWords  matter. If a party says one thing, and his agreement  says another, the \nagreement  normally wins . Ifedoo Enigwe sues his old publisher for selling his book \nwithout permission. It should not have, he says, because it agreed to end its rights to \nhis book long  ago. But their agreement does not say that. So I must dismiss his cop-\nyright and counterfeiting claims.  \nOn this motion to dismiss, I take all the factual allegations in the complaint as \ntrue. Enigwe wrote a book and published it with AuthorHouse . Am. Compl ., D.I. 3 \n\u00b6 3. They had a falling out; he sued; and they settled. Id.  \nFifteen years later, AuthorHouse sold two copies of Enigwe\u2019s book on  Amazon. Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 4\u20136. Enigwe was enraged . He says that  the settlement agreement had ended \nAuthorHouse\u2019s  \u201caccess [to] th e book\u201d years before the Amazon sales . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7. Be-\nsides, adds Enigwe, he never signed an agreement letting Amazon sell the book. Id.  \n\u00b6 8. So he sued Author House and Amazon for copyright infringement and counterfeit-\ning. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9\u201316. \nAuthorHouse and Amazon now  move to dismiss. D.I. 12. On this motion, I draw \nall reasonable inferences in favor of Enigwe. Zimmerman v. Corbett , 873 F.3d 414, \n417\u2013 18 (3d Cir. 2017) . And because he lacks a lawyer , I cut  him extra slack . If I can \n\u201creasonably read [ his] pleadings to state a valid claim,\u201d I must. Morgan v. Scott , 83 \nF. Supp. 3d 616, 620 (D. Del. 2015).  \nBut even on that relaxed standard,  Enigwe fails to plead the necessary facts for a \ncounterfeiting claim . \u201cCounterfeiting occurs when\u201d someone uses a \u201clegally registered 3 trademark\u201d without authorization. AstraZeneca AB v. Dr. Reddy\u2019s Lab\u2019ys, Inc. , 209 F. \nSupp. 3d 744, 754 (D. Del. 2016).  Yet Enigwe mentions no registered trademark . So \nhe fails to  show that either company  \u201cinfringed on [one] .\u201d AstraZ eneca AB , 209 F. \nSupp. 3d at  755; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127.  \nHis copyright- infringement claim fares no better. Enigwe had to show that \nAuthorHouse  copied his work without authorization. Tanksley v. Daniels , 902 F.3d \n165, 172\u2013 73 (3d Cir. 2018);  see also Storage Tech. Corp. v. Custom Hardware Eng\u2019g & \nConsulting, Inc. , 421 F.3d 1307, 1315\u2013 16 (Fed. Cir. 2005). He acknowledges that he \nauthorized  AuthorHo use to sell his book  at one point , though he gives  no details . \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6  3, 7. Instead,  he points to a later settlement agreement. He claims that, \nunder that agreement, AuthorHouse could list the book only \u201cfor one more year \u201d but \nwould  \u201cthen turn over the electronic version to [him] .\u201d Id.  \nBut the settlement agreement says no such thing. See In re Burlington Coat Fac-\ntory Secs.  Litig. , 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997) (allowing consideration of docu-\nments \u201cintegral to or explicitly relied upon  in the complaint\u201d). Indeed, it suggests  the \nopposite. One provision ensured that AuthorHouse would \u201cmaintain [] the Book on \n[its] listing for a period of five  [] years \u2026 without charging Enigwe its annual renewal \nfee.\u201d D.I. 14 -1 \u00b6 8 (emphasis added) .  \nIn his briefs, Enigwe changes his argument. He says that the five -year-listing pro-\nvision barred  AuthorHouse from selling his book all those years later . D.I. 15, at 4 \u2013\n5. But that argument fails too. At first glance, that provision says nothing about \nAuthorHouse\u2019s  rights  to sell the book going forward. D.I. 14 -1 \u00b6 8. And if Enigwe 4 wants to argue that it does, he cannot bring that argument to us: the settlement re-\nquires any \u201cdispute  \u2026 over [its] terms\u201d to be brought in the Sou thern District of In-\ndiana. Id. \u00b6 23.   \nThus, Engiwe has failed to provide \u201cfacts from which it would be plausible to con-\nclude that\u201d AuthorHouse printed his book \u201cafter the license expired.\u201d Live Face on \nWeb, LLC v. The Control Group Media Co. , 150 F. Supp. 3d 489, 496 (E.D. Pa. 2015).  \nSo I dismiss his complaint.  \nEnigwe tries two more arguments in response, but both fail. First , he says he chal-\nlenges the settlement agreement \u2019s authenticity . D.I. 15, at 3; see also In re Burlington , \n114 F.3d at 1426 (doc uments considered at motion to dismiss must be authentic). But \nhe does no such thing. Rather, he  argues  that the agreement should have been \u201cfiled \nunder seal in the court docket\u201d in the earlier lawsuit \u2014not that it is fraudulent or has \nbeen altered. D.I. 15 , at 3; c f. Oshinsky v. N.Y. Football Giants, Inc. , 2009 WL \n4120237, at *3 (D.N.J. Nov. 17, 2009).  Filing does not bear on authenticity. So I can-\nnot credit that claim. Id. at *3.  \nPlus, Enigwe says that, even if AuthorHouse is in the clear, Amazon is not. D .I. \n15, at 5. Amazon was just a platform where AuthorHouse could sell its books. Id.  Yet \nwhen Amazon convinced AuthorHouse to do so,  Enigwe  says, Amazon violated anti-\ntrust laws. Id.  5\u20136. But that is irrelevant  to copyright infringement . Enigwe does not \npoint to anything else barring AuthorHouse from selling his book on Amazon. If \nEnigwe revives his lawsuit  against Amazon, he must do so. And if he wants to bring \nan antitrust claim against it , he must do so expressly.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  15(a).  5 * * * * * \nSo I dismiss Enigwe\u2019s claims . If he wants, he may amend his complaint with a \ndifferent theory for why AuthorHouse\u2019s sales were barred. If believes his original \nagreement with AuthorHouse limited its sales, he may refile here. But  if his new \ntheory also relies on the settlement , he should file  in the Southern District of Indiana , \nas its forum -selection clause requires .
