{"case_name": "Silver v. Barclays Bank Delaware, et al.", "case_number": "21-1630", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "03-01-2023", "ocr_text": "1 \n  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \n \n FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nFREDERICK O. SILVER ,   : \n: \nPlaintiff,  : \n: \nv. : Civ. No. 21-1 630-RGA  \n: \nBARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE, et al.,  : \n: \nDefendant s.  : \n \n MEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 1st day of March , 202 3, having considered Plaintiff\u2019s motion to \nvacate stipulation of dismissal and to amend complaint with claims to add parties (D.I. \n25), motion to reopen (D.I. 26), motion to file copy of settlement agreement (D.I. 27),  \nmotion s to take judicial notice (D.I. 32 , 38), motion for court order  (D.I. 40), motion to file \na late notice of appeal (D.I. 42), and motion for in- person evidentiary hearing (D.I. 47) ; \n1. Plaintiff Frederick O. Silver , who appears pro se  and has been granted \nleave to p roceed in forma pauperis , filed this action on November 19, 2021 . (D.I. 2 ).  \nOn April 19, 2022, Defendants filed an Answer, which contained  counterclaims against \nSilver . (D.I. 12).  On June 10, 2022 , Defendants filed a stipulation of dismissal, \npurportedly signed by Plaintiff and counsel for Defendants, seeking to dismiss their claim s and counterclaims against each other, with prejudice.  (D.I. 23).  On June  21, \n2022, the Court granted the stipulation of dismissal and dismissed the case, with \nprejudice.  (D.I. 24).   2 \n 2. On June 29, 2022, Silver  filed a motion to vacate stipulation of dismissal \nand to amend complaint with claims to add parties (D.I. 25), a motion to reopen (D.I. \n26), and a motion to file copy of settlement agreement (D.I. 27).  In the months that \nfollowed, Silver  additionally filed two motions to take judicial notice (D.I. 32, 38), and a \nmotion for court order (D.I. 40).  Defendant have diligently opposed all the above- listed \nmotions and ancillary f ilings.  (D.I. 29, 33, 36, 37, 39, 41). Silver recently filed a motion \nrequesting an evidentiary hearing.  (D.I. 47). The time for a response has not yet \npassed, but I was planning on ordering an evidentiary hearing even before Silver filed \nthe motion requesting one.   \n3. Silver  is essentially seeking relief from the stipulated dismissal of this \naction so that he may file an amended complaint  alleging that Defendants , their \ncounsel , and other additional defendants  breached the settlement agreement , and \nperhaps  to file other claims as well .  In support of Silver\u2019s  argument for breach of the \nsettlement agreement, he requests that I take judicial notice of unauthenticated copies \nof credit reports.  While not part of t he pleadings submitted with the first three motions, \nhe has since declared under oath that he \u201cdid not sign any \u2018 Stipulation of Dismissal With \nPrejudice.\u2019 \u201d  (D.I. 35 at 1). He further declared that he did not \u201csign and file any Notice \nof Settlement\u201d betwee n the parties. ( Id.). Counsel for Defendants subsequently \nsubmitted a statement under oath explaining the correspondence she had with Plaintiff.  \n(D.I. 37).  There is a factual issue here that I need to resolve , as, if Plaintiff is correct \nthat he did not agree to the stipulation and did not sign it, then he is likely entitled to \nrelief under Rules 60(b)(3) or 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   3 \n  4. Other than the possibility that Silver did not sign the stipulation of \ndismissal, and is enti tled to vacate the stipulation of dismissal, he has provided no basis \nto reopen the case. An allegation that the settlement agreement has been breached \nprovides no basis for reopening the case under the circumstances of this case.   The  \ndismissal order did not indicate that the Court was retaining jurisdiction to enforce the \nsettlement agreement , and it did not  incorporate the terms of the settlement agreement .  \nThe Court therefore lacks jurisdiction over allegations of breach of  the settlement \nagreement , or efforts to enforce the settlement agreement .  See Kokkonen v. Guardian \nLife Insurance Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 381-82 (1994) ; Shaffer  v. GTE North, Inc., \n284 F.3d 500, 503-04 & n.4 (3d Cir. 2002);  Sawka v. Healtheast, Inc., 989 F.2d 138, \n141 (3d Cir. 1993) .  Rather, Silver\u2019s  remedy is to file a new action for breach of the \nagreement.  See Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 382.   Thus, the motion to reopen (D.I. 26) will \nbe denied.   \n4. Given  that Silver\u2019s  first batch of motions were filed eight days after  the \ncase was dismissed, and that I am treating the motion to vacate as a Rule 60(b) motion \nfor relief from judgment, I will d ismiss  as moot  his motion to file a late notice of appeal, \nas he separately filed a notice of appeal (D.I. 43), which under the Rules i s deem ed \ntimely with regard to orders yet to be filed.  See  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) (4)(B)(i).  \n5.  Silver\u2019s motion to file a copy of settlement agreement (D.I. 27) will be \ndenied.  There is no reason to have a copy on the docket when the settlement apparently had some degree of confidentiality and there is no proffer as to why it is 4 \n relevant other than in relation to the claimed breach, which is not an issue over which I \nhave jurisdiction.     \n6. Finally, I note Defendants\u2019 suggestion that I bar further filings  from Silver  \nabsent prior Court approval, citing his actions  in this case, and the fact that he has been \ndeclared a \u201cvexatious litigant\u201d and similarly barred by several other courts.  See Silver \nv. Dystrup -Chiang , 2022 WL 741903, at *5  (W.D. Wash. Mar. 11, 2022) (granting \n\u201crequest for entry of a vexatious litigant order\u201d against Silver) , appeal dismissed, No. 22 -\n35258 (9th Cir. Jan. 20, 2023) ; Silver v. Bemporad, 2019 WL 1724047, at * 3 (W.D. Tex. \nApr. 18, 2019) ( classifying Silver as a vexatious litigant  and entering a filing injunction), \nappeal dismissed, 2019 WL 1 3221772 (5th Cir. July 15, 2019); Silver v. Clark County \nNevada , 2020 WL 7082692, at *2  (D. Nev. Dec. 2, 2020) ( designating Silver as a \nvexatious litigant); Silver v. Abbott , 2019 WL 6139503, at *1  (Tex. 3d Ct. App. Nov. 20, \n2019) (noting that Silver \u201cis on the State\u2019s list of vexatious litigants.\u201d).   Although Silver\u2019s \nhistory as set forth in other courts is cause for concern, he has only filed one other case \nin this Court, which is currently pending. See Silver v. Equifax Information Services, \nLLC, No. 22- cv-1217- RGA.  Silver is hereby placed on notice that if he engages in \nconduct similar to what he has done in other courts, I will consider  instituting a vexatious \nlitigant ban against his filing of future suits  in this Court  without prior Court approval.  \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:  \n1. The motion to vacate stipulation of dismissal and to amend complaint with \nclaims to add parties (D.I. 25)  is taken under advisement pending an in -person \nevidentiary hearing to determine whether Plaintiff did or did not sign a settlement 5 \n agreement and did or did not sign a stipulation of dismissal. The motion for an in-person  \nevidentiary hearing (D.I. 47) is GRANTED . The hearing will be limited to the topics of \nwhether Silver agreed to the dismissal of this case, including by signing the stipulation \nof dismissal.  Silver will have the burden to prove that he did not agree to the dismissal.  \nA time for that hearing will be separately set.   \n2. The motion to reopen (D.I. 26)  is DENIED. \n3. The motion to file copy of settlement agreement (D.I. 27)  is DENIED.   \n4. The motion to file a late notice of appeal (D.I. 42)  is DISMISSED  as moot.  \n5.  The motion to file stipulation (D.I. 40) is duplicative and is DISMISSED . \n6. The motions to take judicial notice (D.I. 32, 38) request that I take judicial \nnotice of documents that do not meet the standard for the taking of judicial notice, and those motions are therefore DENIED. \n \n \n/s/ Richard G.
