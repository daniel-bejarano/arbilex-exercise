Connolly", "date": "02-21-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRJCT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nY ANGAROO INC., \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nDIGITAL lVIEDIA SERVICES, \nINC., DUPLICATION SERVICES, \nINC., PELCO PRINTS, INC., \nDUPLICATION HOLDINGS \nCORPORATION, DUPLICATION \nSERVICES, LLC, CENTERFIELD \nCAPITAL PARTNERS, L.P., \nCENTERFIELD CAPITAL \nPARTNERS II, L.P., \nCENTERFIELD CAPITAL \nPARTNERS III, L.P., SR \nCAPITAL ADVISORS, LLC, and \nBOO USA, LLP, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 22-660-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nThis case arises out of an asset purchase agreement. The parties to the \nagreement were Plaintiff Y angaroo Inc. and Defendants Digital Media Services, \nInc., Duplication Services, Inc., Pelco Prints, Inc., Duplication Holdings \nCorporation, and Duplication Services, LLC (collectively, OMS). Y angaroo has \nsued DMS for breach of contract and fiduciary duties, fraudulent inducement, \nindemnification, and unjust enrichment. D.I. 33 ,r,r 58-87, 101-107. Yangaroo has also accused Defendants Centerfield Capital Partners, L.P., Centerfield Capital \nPartners II, L.P ., Centerfield Capital Partners III, L.P ., SR Capital Advisors, LLC, \nand BDO USA, LLP of aiding and abetting DMS 's breach of fiduciary duties, \ntortious interference with the asset purchase agreement, fraudulent inducement, \nand unjust enrichment. D.I. 33 ,r, 79-83, 88-107. \nAlthough the asset purchase agreement expressly provides that \"(e]ach Party \nirrevocably and unconditionally ... consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction \nof the Delaware Court of Chancery ... for any suit, action or legal proceeding \narising out of or relating to th[ e] [ asset purchase] [ a ]greement and the transactions \ncontemplated [t]hereby,\" D.I. 33-1 at 53, Yangaroo filed its suit in this Court. \nY angaroo alleges that this Court has jurisdiction over the case based on diversity of \nthe parties' citizenships under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. D.I. 33 ,r 12. \nPending before me is Defendants' motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(l) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (D.1. 45). \nDefendants argue that this Court lacks diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332 because, \namong other things, Y angaroo and Centerfield Capital Partners II ( Centerfield II) \nare not diverse citizens. \nYangaroo is a Canadian corporation. D.I. 33 ,r 1. Thus, for diversity \njurisdiction to exist, no defendant can be a foreign citizen. See Lincoln Prop. Co. \nv. Roche, 546 U.S. 81, 89 (2005) (holding that\u00a7 1332 \"require[s] complete \n2 diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants\"); Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil \nCo., 526 U.S. 574, 580 n.2 (1999) (\"The foreign citizenship of defendant [],a \nGerman corporation, and plaintiff [],a Norwegian corporation, rendered diversity \nincomplete.\"). \nFor diversity jurisdiction purposes, the citizenship of Centerfield II is based \non the citizenship of each of its partners. See Swiger v. Allegheny Energy, Inc., \n540 F.3d 179, 182 (3d Cir. 2008) (\"[C]ourts are to look to the citizenship of all the \npartners ( or members of other unincorporated associations) to determine whether \nthe federal district court has diversity jurisdiction.\"). Yangaroo's Amended \nComplaint alleges only that Centerfield II is organized under the laws of Delaware \nwith a principal place of business in Indiana. D.I. 33 18. It does not identify the \npartners of Centerfield II or their citizenship. Nor does it allege that every partner \nof Centerfield II is not a foreign citizen. These failures render the Amended \nComplaint facially deficient and require dismissal of the case for lack of diversity \njurisdiction. See Lincoln Ben. Life Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, 800 F.3d 99, 107 (3d Cir. \n2015) (\"A State X plaintiff may ... survive a facial challenge [to diversity \njurisdiction] by alleging that none of the defendant association's members are \ncitizens of State X.\"). \nY angaroo asks as an alternative to dismissal that I grant it jurisdictional \ndiscovery. \"District courts have the authority to allow discovery in order to \n3 determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists. Rule 8(a)(l), however, serves \na screening function: only those plaintiffs who have provided some basis to believe \njurisdiction exists are entitled to discovery on that issue.\" Lincoln, 800 F.3d at 108 \n(internal footnotes and citations omitted). In this case, Y angaroo has not provided \na basis to believe that Centerfield II does not have a foreign partner. Defendants \nhave submitted a sworn declaration by Michael Miller, a senior partner of \nCenterfield Capital Partners. According to Miller, the sole limited partner (Royal \nLondon Assurance) of one of Centerfield II' s limited partners (WP Global \nMezzanine Capital Strategies II (RLA), L.P.) is a British company. DJ. 48 ,r,r 9-\n12. Miller based that sworn statement on discussions he had with the Managing \nDirector and the Chief Compliance Officer of WP Global. D.I. 48 ,r,r 10-12. \nY angaroo has offered no substantive reason why Miller's sworn statement lacks \ncredibility. Its only objection is that the statement is based on hearsay. Given the \npresent circumstances, that objection is insufficient to justify a fishing expedition \nunder the guise of jurisdictional discovery. \"[J]urisdictional discovery is not \navailable merely because the plaintiff requests it.\" Lincoln, 800 F .3 d at 108 n.3 8. \n4 NOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington on this Twenty-first day of February in \n2023, it is HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of \nSubject Matter Jurisdiction (D.I. 45) is GRANTED.1 \n1 Because I am dismissing the case, I need not and will not consider whether \ncounsel complied with their Rule 11 obligation to exercise before they filed the \nComplaint due diligence to determine if diversity jurisdiction existed. See D.I. 50 \n,r,r 6-15 ( detailing steps Plaintiffs counsel took to determine citizenship of \nDefendants after I sua sponte ordered Plaintiff on August 11, 2022 to \"identify no \nlater than August 18, 2022 the citizenship of (1) the members of all LLC \ndefendants and (2) the partners of all partnership defendants.\"); see also Lincoln, \n800 F.3d at 108 (\"In order to satisfy its obligations under Rule 11, a party must \nconduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts alleged in its pleadings . Thus, before \nalleging that none of an unincorporated association's members are citizens of a \nparticular state, a plaintiff should consult the sources at its disposal, including court \nfilings and other public records. If, after this inquiry, the plaintiff has no reason to \nbelieve that any of the association's members share its state of citizenship, it may \nallege complete diversity in good faith.\" (internal footnote and citation omitted)). \n5 "}
