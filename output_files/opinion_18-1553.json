Goode\u2019s Petition and Amended Petition\nfor a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (collectively referred to as \u201cPetition\u201d).\n(D.I. 1; D.I. 11) The State filed an Answer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I.\n14; D.I. 18) For the reasons discussed, the Court will dismiss the Petition.\n\nL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nAs summarized by the Delaware Supreme Court in Petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, the facts\nleading up to Petitioner\u2019s conviction are as follows:\n\nOn April 9, 2014, Jason Terry was walking home after playing\nbasketball at a park in Milford, Delaware. Terry passed by 105\nMontgomery Street, a house frequented by people who were known\nfor drinking and generally carrying on. While walking by the house\nhe ran into an acquaintance, Tiger Reynolds. Reynolds told Terry\nthat a person behind the house wanted to buy marijuana. Evidently,\nTerry was someone known to have marijuana on hand to sell.\nIntending to make a sale, Terry walked down the alley to the area\nbehind 105 Montgomery Street to meet the prospective buyer.\n\nBehind the house he encountered two men he did not recognize, one\nof whom was sitting in a car. The man in the car said he wanted to\nbuy the marijuana. Terry approached him and took the drugs out of\nhis pocket. As he did this, the man in the car pulled out a pistol from\nunder his clothing and pointed it at Terry. Terry, shocked at having\nthe gun pointed at him, asked the man if he was really going to rob\nhim over seven grams of marijuana. The man then shot Terry two\ntimes.\n\nTerry stumbled back to the street, where police and an ambulance\narrived shortly and took him to the hospital. The shooter and the\nother man fled. They did not take the drugs. Although there were\nvarious individuals present in and around 105 Montgomery Street at\nthe time of the shooting, they were all uncooperative when police\nquestioned them about the shooter's identity.\n\nFortunately, the neighbors in the house next door witnessed and\nfilmed portions of the episode, and were more forthcoming with\npolice. One neighbor identified [Petitioner], whom he recognized\nfrom high school, as being present behind 105 Montgomery Street\nbefore the shooting. The neighbors also filmed Terry going down\nthe alley before he was shot, men fleeing after the shooting, and the\nwounded Terry stumbling back up the alley after the shooting, The\nfilm also captured the sound of gunshots. The police recovered two\nshell casings from the ground near where the shooting occurred, but\nno weapon.\n\nTerry was taken to the Milford Memorial Hospital, where Detective\nJohn Horsman questioned him. Detective Horsman had been among\nthe first officers to arrive at the scene of the shooting. Although\nTerry could not identify the shooter by name, he said that he would\nbe able to recognize the man ifhe saw him. The next day, Terry was\nmoved to Christiana Hospital. During his second interview with the\npolice there, Terry repeated to Detective Horsman that he would be\nable to identify the shooter if he saw his face.\n\nAfter the second interview with the police, Terry's cousin Raye\nBoone showed Terry a picture of [Petitioner] that she found on\nFacebook. According to Boone, [Petitioner] had been going around\ntown bragging about shooting Terry. After seeing the picture of\n[Petitioner], Terry was sure [Petitioner] was the man who shot him.\nThe police arrested [Petitioner] for the shooting after Terry\nidentified [Petitioner] as the shooter based on the picture Boone\nshowed to him.\n\nGoode v. State, 136 A.3d 303, 306-07 (Del. 2016).\nB. Procedural Background\nPetitioner was indicted on May 19, 2014, and charged with first degree assault,\n\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (\u201cPFDCF\u201d), carrying a concealed\n\ndeadly weapon (\u201cCCD W\u201d), possession of ammunition by a person prohibited (\u201cPABPP\u201d), and\ntwo counts of possession of a firearm by a person prohibited (\u201cPFBPP\u201d). (D.I. 15-1 at 1, Entry\nNo. 5) On October 13, 2014, the Superior Court severed the PFBPP and PABPP charges. (D.I.\n\n15-1 at 3, Entry No. 28) In November 2014, Petitioner filed a motion in limine to exclude the\nvictim Terry\u2019s identification of him by a photograph. (DJ. 15-3 at 62-65) The Superior Court\ndenied the motion after holding a hearing. (/d. at 68-70)\n\nOn January 15, 2015, a Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of first degree assault,\nPFDCF, and CCDW. See Goode, 136 A.3d at 308. Petitioner filed a motion for judgment of\nacquittal or, alternatively, for a new trial. (D.I. 15-1 at 7, Entry Nos. 70-73) The Superior Court\ndenied the motion. (D.I. 15-1 at 7, Entry Nos. 68-72)\n\nBefore sentencing, police officers discovered a gun which matched the shell casings\nfound at the crime scene in this case. See Goode, 136 A.3d at 308. The parties and the Superior\nCourt agreed that further testing should be performed on the gun, and the Superior Court\npostponed Petitioner\u2019s sentencing to allow for additional testing and to provide trial counsel with\nan opportunity to file a motion for new trial if trial counsel determined one was warranted. See\nid. Petitioner did not file a motion for new trial by the next status conference. (D.I. 15-5 at 77-\n78) Sentencing was scheduled, at which time trial counsel requested a continuance so testing\ncould be conducted on the gun. (D.I. 15-1 at 7, Entry Nos. 68, 74-79; D.L 15-2 at 11; D.I. 15-5\nat 78) The Superior Court denied the continuance request, and proceeded with sentencing. (D.1.\n15-1 at 8, Entry Nos. 76, 77, 82; D.I. 15-5 at 79) On May 29, 2015, the Superior Court\nsentenced Petitioner as follows: (1) for the PFDCF conviction, to five years at Level V\nincarceration (with credit for 406 days previously served); (2) for the first degree assault\nconviction, to fifteen years at Level V incarceration, suspended after eight years for six months\nat Level IV work release, followed by two years at Level II probation; and (3) for the CCDW\nconviction, to five years at Level V incarceration, suspended for two years of Level III probation.\n\nSee State v. Goode, 2017 WL 4164421, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 20, 2017). Petitioner\n\nappealed, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions and sentences on\nApril 4, 2016. See Goode, 136 A.3d at 315.\n\nPetitioner filed a counseled motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Delaware\nSuperior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d) on September 12, 2016. (D.I. 15-11 at 63-\n\n64) On January 30, 2017, post-conviction counsel filed a motion to withdraw from\n\nrepresentation because he could find no meritorious issues to pursue. (/d. at 66) Another\nattorney took over representing Petitioner and filed an amended Rule 61 motion on March 16,\n2017. (Id. at 81-105) The Superior Court denied the amended Rule 61 motion on September 20,\n2017, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision in July 2018. See Goode, 2017\nWL 4164421, at *4; Goode v. State, 190 A.3d 996 (Table), 2018 WL 3323644 (Del. Jul. 5,\n2018).\nIL. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\nA. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\n\nA federal court may consider a habeas petition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the\n\nground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Absent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant\nhabeas relief for a claim challenging the validity of the petitioner\u2019s state custody unless the\npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b);\nO'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275\n(1971). The AEDPA states, in pertinent part:\n\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in\n\ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be\ngranted unless it appears that \u2014\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts\nof the State; or\n\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or\n(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to\nprotect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).\n\nThe exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to\ngive \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one\ncomplete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O'Sullivan, 526 U.S. at\n844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). A petitioner satisfies the\nexhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the habeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the\nstate\u2019s highest court, either on direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural\nmanner permitting the court to consider the claims on their merits. Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447,\n451 n.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989).\n\nA petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused if state procedural rules\npreclude him from seeking further relief in state courts. See Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160\n(3d Cir. 2000); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 297-98 (1989). Although treated as technically\nexhausted, such claims are nonetheless procedurally defaulted. See Lines, 208 F.3d at 160;\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750-51 (1991). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas\nclaim to the state\u2019s highest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the\nmerits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is\nexhausted but procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S.\n\n255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the\npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting\ntherefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the court does not review the\nclaims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at\n750-51. To demonstrate cause for a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome\nobjective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s\nprocedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual\nprejudice, a petitioner must show \u201cthat [the errors at trial] worked to his actual and substantial\ndisadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d Id. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, a federal court may excuse a procedural default if the petitioner\ndemonstrates that failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\nSee Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d\nCir. 2001). A petitioner demonstrates a miscarriage of justice by showing a \u201cconstitutional\nviolation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d Murray, 477\nU.S. at 496. Actual innocence means factual innocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v.\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). In order to establish actual innocence, the petitioner\nmust present new reliable evidence \u2014 not presented at trial - that demonstrates \u201cit is more likely\nthan not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nHouse v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 537-38 (2006); see Sweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 522-24 (3d\n\nCir. 2002).\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the federal\ncourt must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if the state court\u2019s\ndecision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was\nan unreasonable determination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn, 250\nF.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\nA claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) if\nthe state court decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a\nprocedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. 2009). The\ndeferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s order is unaccompanied by\nan opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86,\n98 (2011). As explained in Harrington, \u201cit may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the\nclaim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the\ncontrary.\u201d Id. at 99. The Supreme Court expanded the purview of the Richter presumption in\nJohnson v. Williams, 568 U.S. 289 (2013). Pursuant to Johnson, if a petitioner has presented the\nclaims raised in a federal habeas application to a state court, and the state court opinion addresses\nsome but not all of those claims, the federal habeas court must presume (subject to rebuttal) that\nthe state court adjudicated the unaddressed federal claims on the merits. Id. at 298-301. The\n\nconsequence of this presumption is that the federal habeas court will then be required to review\nthe previously unaddressed claims under \u00a7 2254(d) whereas, in the past, federal habeas courts\nofien assumed \u201cthat the state court simply overlooked the federal claim[s] and proceed[ed] to\nadjudicate the claim[s] de novo.\u201d Id. at 292-93.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the state\ncourt's determinations of factual issues are correct. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This\npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is only\nrebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1);\nCampbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 341\n(2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies to factual issues,\nwhereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to factual decisions).\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nPetitioner\u2019s timely filed \u00a7 2254 Petition asserts four grounds for relief: (1) the Delaware\nstate courts unreasonably determined the facts and unreasonably applied federal law by rejecting\nPetitioner\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated by the introduction of Terry\u2019s out-\nof-court identification of Petitioner that was based upon a photograph of Petitioner provided by\nTerry\u2019s cousin; (2) the trial court\u2019s refusal to provide Petitioner\u2019s requested eyewitness jury\ninstruction deprived Petitioner of his right to due process, and appellate counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to raise this argument on direct appeal; (3) trial counsel provided\nineffective assistance by eliciting prejudicial testimony while cross-examining the victim Terry;\nand (4) the State violated Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 16(b), Brady v. Maryland, 373\n\nU.S. 83 (1963), and the Confrontation Clause by not providing Petitioner with Raye Boone\u2019s\n(Terry\u2019s cousin) name and the email Boone sent to Detective Horsman prior to the motion in\nlimine hearing.\nA. Claim One: Unreliable Witness Identification\nBefore trial, counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude Terry\u2019s eyewitness identification\nof Petitioner that was based upon a photograph Terry\u2019s cousin Raye Boone found on Facebook.\n(D.I. 15-3 at 63-65) Petitioner argued that the admission of Terry\u2019s identification violated his\ndue process rights because it was unreliably suggestive and tainted any in-court identification.\nId. The Superior Court denied the motion in limine, explaining that there was no due process\nviolation because no state actor was involved in the identification process. (D.I. 15-3 at 68-74)\nPetitioner presented the same identification/due process violation argument to the Delaware\nSupreme Court on direct appeal. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s\ndecision:\nTerry identified [Petitioner] based on the photograph his cousin\nfound on Facebook. The police were not involved in the\nidentification, which ends the constitutional inquiry. We also note\nthat [Petitioner] availed himself of all the procedural protections\navailable to ensure a fair trial. The court appointed counsel for\n[Petitioner], who attempted through cross-examination to\nundermine the credibility and reliability of Terry's identification.\nThe court instructed the jury that to convict they must find beyond\na reasonable doubt that it was, in fact, [Petitioner] who shot Terry.\nIn addition, [Petitioner\u2019s] counsel argued strenuously that Terry's\nidentification was unreliable. [Petitioner] also elected not to call\nBoone as a witness, which was within counsel's strategic discretion.\nAccordingly, the Superior Court correctly declined to suppress\nTerry's identification of [Petitioner].\nGoode, 136 A.3d at 311.\nIn Claim One, Petitioner contends that Terry\u2019s pre-trial identification of him should have\n\nbeen suppressed as unduly suggestive because the identification was based on a photograph from\n\n9\n\nFacebook provided to Terry by his cousin Raye Boone. Given the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s\ndenial of the same argument, Claim One will only warrant relief if the Delaware Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision involved an unreasonable determination of facts or an unreasonable application\nof clearly established federal law.\n\nThe clearly established federal law governing the admissibility of eyewitness\nidentifications is articulated in Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968) and its\nprogeny. In Simmons, the Supreme Court held that \u201cconvictions based on eyewitness\nidentification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside ... only if\nthe photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a\nvery substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d Simmons, 390 U.S. at 384. The\nSupreme Court has clarified that the Due Process Clause is only implicated when the\nidentification involves the \u201cpresence of state action.\u201d Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228,\n241 (2012). Asa result, \u201cthe Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry\ninto the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the identification was not procured under\nunnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement.\u201d Jd. at 248.\n\nPetitioner contends that the Delaware state courts unreasonably determined the facts by\nconcluding the police were not involved in Terry\u2019s identification of Petitioner. Specifically,\nPetitioner asserts that the police were involved in the identification process because Raye Boone\nemailed the photo to Detective Horsman, who then showed the photo to Terry. Petitioner,\nhowever, is mistaken about the sequence of events. The record demonstrates that Detective\nHorsman visited Terry at Christiana Care Hospital on April 10, 2014. (D.I. 15-5 at 14, 18)\n\nAlthough Terry provided Detective Horsman with a general description of the shooter and stated\n\n10\nhe would recognize the shooter if he saw the person again, Terry was not able to provide the\nDetective with the shooter\u2019s name. (D1. 15-5 at 14, 18-19) It appears that Boone visited Terry\nin the hospital on April 10, 2014, after Detective Horsman\u2019s visit (D.I. 14-1 at 1-2; DI. 15-9 at\n10), at which time she showed the photo to Terry, and sent the photo to Terry\u2019s phone. (D.I. 14-\n1; DI. 15-3 at 46; D.I. 15-9 at 10) Detective Horsman visited Terry in the hospital on April 11,\n2014 and, during that visit, Terry showed Detective Horsman the photo on his phone and said,\n\u201cThis is the guy that shot me.\u201d (D.I 14-1 at 2-3; D.I. 15-5 at 19-20; D.I. 15-9 at 7-8) Either\nsimultaneously or a short time thereafter, but while Detective Horsman was still in Terry\u2019s\nhospital room, Horsman received an email from Boone that contained the same photo. (D.I. 15-5\nat 22-23)\n\nThis summary of facts demonstrates that Terry identified Petitioner as the shooter from\nthe photo provided by Boone before Detective Horsman even had a copy of the photo. Given\nPetitioner\u2019s failure to provide any clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Court\naccepts as correct the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s factual determination that the Terry\u2019s out-of-\n\ncourt identification of Petitioner was not procured by law enforcement action.!\n\n'The Court\u2019s instant inquiry focuses on whether the identification process involved a \u201cstate-\narranged identification procedure.\u201d See United v. Jones, 785 F. App\u2019x 68, 69-70 (3d Cir. Aug.\n20, 2019). Given the absence of any state or police action, the Court does not need to consider\nthe issue of \u201csuggestiveness.\u201d See Perry, 565 U.S. at 241-44. Nevertheless, the following\nexcerpt from Perry addresses Petitioner\u2019s implicit argument regarding the suggestiveness of\neyewitness identifications:\n\nMost eyewitness identifications involve some element of suggestion.\n\nIndeed, all in-court identifications do. Out-of-court identifications\n\nvolunteered by witnesses are also likely to involve suggestive\n\ncircumstances. For example, suppose a witness identifies the defendant to\n\npolice officers after seeing a photograph of the defendant in the press\n\ncaptioned \u201ctheft suspect,\u201d or hearing a radio report implicating the\n11\nIn turn, since the police were not involved in Terry\u2019s out-of-court identification of\nPetitioner, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts did not unreasonably apply\nSimmons and Perry in holding that there was no need to engage in any further due process\ninquiry with respect to Terry\u2019s out-of-court identification. Accordingly, the Court will deny\nClaim One for failing to satisfy the standard in \u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (2).\n\nB. Claim Two: Eyewitness Identification Jury Instruction\n\nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court violated his right to due\nprocess by refusing to include his requested language in the eyewitness identification jury\ninstruction. Petitioner also contends that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by\nfailing to raise the issue on direct appeal.\n\nThe record reveals that the Delaware Supreme Court denied the ineffective assistance of\ncounsel argument as meritless on post-conviction appeal. In contrast, the Superior Court denied\nPetitioner\u2019s due process argument in Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 proceeding as procedurally barred\nunder Rule 61(i)(4) for being formerly adjudicated. See Goode, 2017 WL 4164421, at *3. On\npost-conviction appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court noted in a footnote that the \u201cSuperior Court\nproperly rejected [Petitioner\u2019s free-standing due process claim] as procedurally barred under\n\nRule 61(i)(4),\u201d\" but proceeded to adjudicate the merits of the due process claim when it decided\n\ndefendant in the crime. Or suppose the witness knew that the defendant ran\nwith the wrong crowd and saw him on the day and in the vicinity of the\ncrime. Any of these circumstances might have \u201csuggested\u201d to the witness\nthat the defendant was the person the witness observed committing the\ncrime.\n\nPerry, 565 U.S. at 244.\n\n2Goode, 2018 WL 3323644, at *2 n.8.\n12\n\nPetitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. See Goode, 2018 WL 3323644, at\n*3,\n\nThe State contends that the Delaware state courts\u2019 application of Rule 61(i)(4) to\nPetitioner\u2019s freestanding due process claim demonstrates that the argument is procedurally\ndefaulted and, therefore, argues that the Court should deny the claim as procedurally barred from\nhabeas review. The Court disagrees. Although a formerly adjudicated claim barred by Rule\n61(i)(4) is defaulted for Delaware state court purposes, on federal habeas review the fact that the\nclaim was formerly adjudicated means that it was decided on the merits? See Cone v. Bell, 556\nU.S. 449, 466 (2009) (\u201cWhen a state court declines to review the merits of a petitioner's claim on\nthe ground that it has done so already, it creates no bar to federal habeas review.\u201d). Additionally,\nalthough a state court\u2019s alternative decision on the merits does not prevent a federal habeas court\nfrom relying on a state court's enforcement of a state procedural bar, in this situation the Court\nwill proceed to analyze whether the Delaware Supreme Court's denial of both sub-arguments in\n\nClaim Two as meritless warrants relief under \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n3The State asserts that there is a certain \u201ccategory of cases\u201d the Court has not treated as\nadjudicated on the merits after the state courts have applied Rule 61(i)(4), and contends that\nPetitioner\u2019s instant freestanding due process claim falls within that category. (D.I. 14 at 13 n.40)\nThe Court is not persuaded. One of the cases the State cites to support its argument \u2014 Wilson v.\nCarroll, 2006 WL 2294881 (D. Del. Aug. 8, 2006) \u2014 was decided before the Supreme Court\u2019s\n2009 explicit statement in Cone v. Bell that claims dismissed as procedurally barred in state\ncourts due to being formerly adjudicated are not barred for federal habeas purposes. As for the\nother case upon which the State relies \u2014- Johnson v. Hines, 83 F. Supp. 3d 554, 560-61 (D. Del.\n2015) \u2014 the finding of a procedural bar was premised on the state courts\u2019 combined application\nof Delaware\u2019s waiver rule and Rule 61(i)(4).\n\n13\n1. Freestanding due process claim\n\nPetitioner complains that the pattern jury instruction on eyewitness identification\nprovided by the trial court did not give \u201cguidance to the jury on how to evaluate eyewitness\ntestimony despite the fact that identification was the basic issue in Petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d (D.I. 18 at\n6) Citing United States v. Barber, 442 F.2d 517 (3d Cir. 1971) and United States v. Zeiler, 470\nF.2d 717 (3d Cir. 1972), Petitioner contends that the trial court was obligated to instruct the jury\nto focus \u201con precise factors which affect the credibility and reliability of eyewitness testimony.\u201d\n(D.L. 11 at 10; D.I. 18 at 5) Consequently, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court deprived\nhim of his right to due process by refusing to include the specific language he requested in the\njury instruction.\n\nClaims involving jury instructions in state criminal trials are matters of state law, and\ngenerally, are only cognizable on federal habeas review if the instructions were so fundamentally\nunfair that they deprived the petitioner of a fair trial and due process. See Henderson v. Kibbe,\n431 USS. 145, 154 (1977); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107 (1982); Estelle, 502 U.S, at 71-72\n(\u201c[T]he fact that [an] instruction was allegedly incorrect under state law is not a basis for habeas\nrelief.\u201d). On federal habeas review, the relevant question is \u201cwhether the ailing instruction by\nitself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violated due process, not merely\nwhether the instruction is undesirable, erroneous, or even universally condemned.\u201d Martin v.\nWarden, Huntingdon State Correctional Inst., 653 F.2d 799, 809 (3d Cir.1981) (cleaned up).\nFurther, a habeas petitioner challenging a state court jury instruction must \u201cpoint to a federal\n\nrequirement that jury instructions on the elements of an offense ... must include particular\n\n14\n\nprovisions,\u201d or \u201cdemonstrate that the jury instructions deprived him of a defense which federal\nlaw provided to him.\u201d Johnson v. Rosemeyer, 117 F.3d 104, 110 (3d Cir. 1997).\nThe Superior Court in Petitioner\u2019s case gave the following pattern instruction to the jury:\n\nAn issue in this case is the identification of the defendant. To find the\ndefendant guilty, you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe defendant has been accurately identified, that the wrongful conduct\ncharged in this case actually took place, and that the defendant was, in\nfact, the person who committed the act. If there is any reasonable doubt\nabout the identification of the defendant, you must give the defendant\nthe benefit of such doubt and find the defendant not guilty.\n\n(D.L. 15-9 at 23, 53) Trial counsel asked the Superior Court to add the following language to the\ninstruction:\n\nIdentification testimony is an expression of belief or impression by\nthe witness. Its value depends upon the opportunity of the witness\nto observe the offender at the time of the offense, retain that memory\nand to make a reliable identification later. In appraising the\nidentification testimony of Jason Terry you should consider the\nfollowing:\n\n1. Whether Mr. Terry had the capacity and an\nadequate opportunity to observe the offender, at\nthe time of the offense. [...]\n\n2. Was the in-court identification made by Jason\nTerry a product of his own recollection? You\nmay consider both the strength of the\nidentification, and the circumstances under\nwhich the in-court identification was made. If\nthe identification by Jason Terry [was]\ninfluenced by circumstances under which the\nDefendant was presented to him for\nidentification, you should scrutinize the\nidentification with great care. You may also\nconsider the length of time that lapsed between\nthe occurrence of the crime and the next\nopportunity for Jason Terry to see the Defendant\nas a factor bearing on the reliability of the\nidentification.\n\n15\n3. Finally, you must consider the credibility of\n\nJason Terry\u2019s identification of the Defendant in\n\nthe same way as any other witness, considering\n\nwhether they are truthful, and considering\n\nwhether they had the capacity and opportunity to\n\nmake a reliable observation on the matter in their\n\ntestimony.\n(DI. 15-9 at 51-52) The Superior Court declined to add this language to the instruction because\nit viewed Petitioner\u2019s requested additional language as \u201csomething that will be appropriately\nargued by counsel.\u201d (/d. at 23)\n\nPetitioner contends that the \u201cproposed instruction submitted by trial counsel\u201d would have\n\u201cfocus[ed] the jury\u2019s attention on how to analyze and consider the factual issues with regard to\nthe trustworthiness of Terrys identification,\u201d whereas \u201cthe generic three sentence pattern\ninstruction given by the court was insufficient [because] it failed to instruct the jury on the\npossibility of misidentification [or] emphasiz[e] the factors affecting reliability.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 13-\n14) After considering the jury instruction in its entirety, the Court concludes that the Superior\nCourt\u2019s failure to include Petitioner\u2019s requested language in the pattern eyewitness instruction\ndid not deprive Petitioner of due process. As an initial matter, there is no clearly established\nfederal law requiring a special instruction on eyewitness identification. The two cases cited by\nPetitioner \u2014 Barber and Zeiler \u2014 are Third Circuit cases where the courts had adopted a\ncautionary eyewitness instruction requirement as part of the Third Circuit\u2019s supervisory power\n\nover the administration of criminal justice in federal courts within its jurisdiction. Although\n\nmany federal and state courts have adopted cautionary eyewitness-specific jury instructions that\n\n16\n\nwarn \u201cthe jury to take care in appraising identification evidence,\u201d the requirement to give such\nan instruction does not derive from the Due Process Clause or the United States Supreme Court.\nIn other words, there is no clearly established federal law requiring state courts to provide\ncautionary eyewitness-specific warnings in a jury instruction.\n\nMoreover, as the Delaware Supreme Court held on post-conviction appeal, the \u201cSuperior\nCourt's instruction on eyewitness identification was a correct statement of the law, was\nreasonably informative, and was not misleading.\u201d Goode, 2018 WL 3323644, at *3. This Court\nis bound to accept the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the pattern jury instruction\ncomplied with Delaware state law, and the fact that the instruction was a \u201cgeneric three sentence\npattern instruction\u201d does not affect that determination. Additionally, the record reveals that trial\ncounsel focused the jury\u2019s attention on the issues of reliability and credibility during closing\nargument.\n\nGiven all of these circumstances, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the Superior\nCourt\u2019s refusal to include his requested cautionary language in the jury instruction had a\nsubstantial and injurious effect on the fairness of his trial so as to violate due process.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Petitioner\u2019s due process argument in Claim Two.\n\n2. Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\n\nPetitioner also contends that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing\nto argue on direct appeal that the Superior Court erred in denying his requested eyewitness jury\ninstruction. The Delaware Supreme Court denied the argument as meritless on post-conviction\n\nappeal. Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim will only\n\n\u2018Perry , 565 U.S. at 246.\n17\n\nwarrant relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, or an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\n\nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective assistance of trial\nand appellate counsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003);\nLewis v. Johnson, 359 F.3d 646, 656 (3d Cir. 2004) (explaining that the right to effective\nassistance of counsel also extends to the first appeal). Under the first Strickland prong, a\npetitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness,\u201d with reasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the\ntime counsel rendered assistance. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second Strickland\nprong, a petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694. A\nreasonable probability is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id.\nIn the appellate context, the test for prejudice under Strickland \u201cis not whether petitioners would\nlikely prevail upon remand, but whether [the court of appeals] would have likely reversed and\nordered a remand had the issue been raised on direct appeal.\u201d United States v. Mannino, 212 F.3d\n835, 844 (3d Cir. 2000); see also Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 287-88 (2000) (explaining that\nthe question when determining prejudice in the appellate context is whether the issues counsel\ndid not raise \u201cwere clearly stronger\u201d than the issues counsel did raise).\n\nFinally, in order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must\nmake concrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk summary dismissal.\n\nSee Wells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991); Dooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885,\n\n18\n\n891-92 (3d Cir. 1987). Although not insurmountable, the Strickland standard is highly\ndemanding and leads to a strong presumption that the representation was professionally\nreasonable. See Strickland, 466 U.S, at 689.\n\nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that the Delaware\nSupreme Court correctly identified the Strickland standard applicable to Petitioner\u2019s ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel allegation. Consequently, the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision was not contrary to clearly established federal law. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 406 (\u201c[A]\nrun-of-the-mill state-court decision applying the correct legal rule from [Supreme Court] cases to\nthe facts of a prisoner\u2019s case [does] not fit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019\nclause\u201d).\n\nThe Court\u2019s inquiry is not over, however, because it must also determine if the Delaware\nSupreme Court reasonably applied the Strickland standard to the facts of Petitioner\u2019s case. See\nHarrington, 562 U.S. at 105-06. When performing this inquiry, the Court must review the\nDelaware state courts\u2019 denial of Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel allegations through\na \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens.> Jd. \u201c[T]he question is not whether counsel's actions were\n\nreasonable, [but rather], whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied\n\n5As explained by the Richter Court,\nThe standards created by Strickland and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u201chighly\ndeferential,\u201d and when the two apply in tandem, review is \u201cdoubly\u201d\nso. The Strickland standard is a general one, so the range of\nreasonable applications is substantial. Federal habeas courts must\nguard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under\nStrickland with unreasonableness under \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nRichter, 562 U.S. at 105 (internal citations omitted).\n\n19\n\nStrickland\u2019 s deferential standard.\u201d Id. When assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question\nis \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result would have been different\u201d but for counsel\u2019s\nperformance, and the \u201clikelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\u201d\nId. And finally, when viewing a state court\u2019s determination that a Strickland claim lacks merit\nthrough the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief is precluded \u201cso long as fairminded jurists\ncould disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d Jd. at 101.\n\nHere, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply\nStrickland in denying Petitioner\u2019s instant allegation. An attorney's decision about which issues\nto raise on appeal is strategic, and an attorney is not required to raise every possible non-\nfrivolous issue on appeal. See Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 272 (2000); Jones v. Barnes, 463\nUSS. 745 (1983). As a general rule, the presumption of effective assistance of appellate counsel\nwill be overcome \u201conly when ignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented.\u201d Smith,\n528 U.S. at 285. The Court has already determined that Petitioner\u2019s due process complaint\nregarding the Superior Court\u2019s failure to provide his requested instruction on eyewitness\nidentification lacks merit. Consequently, the Court concludes that appellate counsel did not\nperform deficiently by failing to raise a meritless argument on direct appeal.\n\nSimilarly, Petitioner cannot demonstrate a reasonably probability that the Delaware\nSupreme Court would have likely reversed and ordered a remand but for appellate counsel\u2019s\nfailure to challenge the jury instruction on direct appeal. Accordingly, the Court will deny\nPetitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim for failing to satisfy the standard in\n\n\u00a7 2254(d).\n\n20\n\nC. Claim Three: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\n\nNext, Petitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by eliciting\nprejudicial testimony from Terry during cross-examination. Petitioner raised this argument to\nthe Delaware state courts in his Rule 61 proceeding. On post-conviction appeal, the Delaware\nSupreme Court denied Claim Three as meritless under Strickland. Consequently, Claim Three\nwill only warrant habeas relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision involved an\nunreasonable application of Strickland.\n\nDuring Petitioner\u2019s trial, Terry testified that he identified Petitioner as the man who shot\nhim after his cousin, Raye Boone, showed him a photo of Petitioner and told him that Petitioner\nhad been going around town bragging about how he shot Petitioner. The following exchange\noccurred during Terry\u2019s direct examination:\n\nSTATE: How did [Boone] go about showing you this photo, what did she say?\n\nTERRY: Well, these two individuals, after they shot me they had to go around town\nand brag and tell everybody.\n\n(D.L 15-11 at 23-24) The Superior Court immediately interrupted and told Terry not to testify\nabout \u201c[w]hat other people around town were saying,\u201d and also told the jury \u201cto disregard that\ncomment about the neighborhood.\u201d (/d. at 24) Trial counsel did not object to Terry\u2019s hearsay\nstatement, and Terry did not make any more statements on direct examination about what Boone\nhad told him.\n\nOn cross-examination, trial counsel asked Terry whether Boone had implied that\nPetitioner was the person who shot him. (/d. at 25) Terry responded, \u201cNo, she replies and she\nsays we have an idea because they was going around town, somebody was going around town\nbragging about they shot somebody today. And they was in the area\u2014\" (/d.) Trial counsel\n\n21\ninterrupted Terry and asked him, \u201cShe didn\u2019t say that, she shows you the picture and says, this is\nwho we think shot you?\u201d (/d.) Terry replied, \u201cYes, and I identified the person because I know.\u201d\n(Ud. at 26)\n\nOn direct appeal, Petitioner argued that Terry\u2019s testimony about what Boone told him\nviolated Delaware\u2019s hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause. The Delaware Supreme Court\nheld that the Superior Court\u2019s \u201cprompt instruction for the jury to disregard the statements cured\nany [hearsay] error,\u201d and denied Petitioner\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument as waived. See\nGoode, 136 A.3d at 312-13. In his Rule 61 proceeding, Petitioner argued that \u201cdefense counsel's\ncross-examination of Terry was constitutionally ineffective because counsel should have\nanticipated the risk of eliciting Terry's inadmissible and prejudicial hearsay comment that\n\u2018somebody was going around town bragging about they shot somebody today.\u2019 [Petitioner]\ncontend|ed] that defense counsel's error incriminated him and that defense counsel compounded\nhis mistake by failing to request a curative instruction.\u201d Goode, 2018 WL 3323644, at *4. The\nSuperior Court denied the argument as barred under Rule 61(i)(4). See Goode, 2017 WL\n4164421, at *3. On post-conviction appeal, however, the Delaware Supreme Court considered\nthe merits of the argument and rejected it, opining:\n\nIn reviewing defense counsel's cross-examination of Terry as a\nwhole, we find trial counsel's questioning to fall within \u201cthe wide\nrange of professionally competent assistance.\u201d Defense counsel\nasked Terry, \u201cRegardless, she shows you the picture and implies that\nthis is the person that shot you, correct?\u201d The question was narrowly\nfocused and required a yes or no response. We reject [Petitioner\u2019s]\ncontention that defense counsel erred by failing to anticipate that\nTerry's response to the question would include his cousin's hearsay\n\nstatement that \u201csomebody was going around town bragging that they\nshot somebody today.\u201d\n\n22\nMoreover, we reject [Petitioner\u2019s] contention that defense counsel\nerred by failing to request a curative instruction. Defense counsel\nresponded to Terry's hearsay statement by interrupting Terry's\nanswer and rephrasing the question, which prompted Terry's\naffirmative response. We find counsel's choice to proceed in this\nmanner, rather than interrupting his own cross-examination by\nasking the trial judge to give a curative instruction, to be entirely\nreasonable. Requesting a curative instruction would have drawn the\njury's unwarranted attention to the hearsay testimony. Under the\ncircumstances, we conclude that counsel's performance was well\nwithin the bounds of reasonable professional conduct.\nGoode, 2018 WL 3323544, at *4.\n\nAfter reviewing the record, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court did not\nunreasonably apply Strickland in denying the instant ineffective assistance claim. As previously\nexplained, the Superior Court had already instructed the jury to disregard Terry\u2019s earlier\nstatement about the\u201d neighborhood\u201d during direct examination. Consequently, trial counsel had\nno reason to anticipate that cross-examining Terry about Boone showing the photo to him would\nelicit another similar hearsay comment. The transcript also reveals that trial counsel attempted to\ncut off Terry\u2019s response once it became apparent that he was again relaying hearsay information.\nAnd finally, given the other evidence presented against Petitioner during the trial,\u00ae Petitioner\ncannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different\n\nbut for trial counsel\u2019s question and absence of an additional curative statement. Accordingly, the\n\nCourt will deny Claim Three for failing to satisfy the standard in \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n*Both a video recording and an independent witness placed Petitioner at the shooting only\nminutes before it took place. See Goode, 136 A.3d at 307, 314.\n\n23\n\nD. Claim Four: Violations of the Delaware Rules, Brady v. Maryland, the\nConfrontation Clause, and Related Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\n\nIn Claim Four, Petitioner contends that the State violated the Delaware Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, Brady v. Maryland, and the Confrontation Clause by not providing him with Raye\nBoone\u2019s name, the photo of Petitioner, and the email Boone sent to Detective Horsman prior to\nthe motion in limine hearing. Relatedly, Petitioner also alleges that trial counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to ask the State to provide Boone\u2019s identity prior to trial. For the\nfollowing reasons, the Court concludes that Claim Four does not warrant habeas relief.\n\n1. Delaware rules\n\nPetitioner asserts that the State violated Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 16(b) \u2014\nwhich governs the types of information subject to disclosure \u2014 by not providing Boone\u2019s identity,\nthe photo, and Boone\u2019s email prior to the motion in limine hearing. It is well-established that\n\n\u00bb7 and claims based on errors of state law\n\n\u201c[s]tate courts are the ultimate expositors of state law,\nare not cognizable on habeas review. Estelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68. Therefore, the Court will deny\nPetitioner\u2019s argument concerning a violation of Delaware\u2019s discovery rules for failing to assert a\nproper basis for federal habeas relief.\n2. Brady v. Maryland\nPetitioner contends that the State violated Brady v. Maryland by not providing trial\ncounsel with Boone\u2019s identity, the photograph, or the email Boone sent to Detective Horsman\n\ncontaining Petitioner\u2019s photograph prior to the motion in limine hearing. Petitioner presented the\n\nsame argument on direct appeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court rejected it as meritless.\n\nMullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975).\n24\n\nTherefore, Petitioner\u2019s instant Brady claim will only warrant relief if the Delaware Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal\nlaw.\n\nThe following facts provide important background information relevant to the Court\u2019s\nanalysis of Petitioner\u2019s Brady argument. In June 2014, the State provided trial counsel with\nredacted police reports. (D.I. 15-5 at 7-11) Detective Horsman\u2019s report stated that, on April 11,\n2014, Terry showed him a photograph of Petitioner. (/d. at 14) The Detective noted that \u201ca\nfamily member who wished to stay anonymous\u201d had provided the photograph to Terry. Ud.) On\nthe first day scheduled for trial, just prior to the Superior Court\u2019s hearing on Petitioner\u2019s motion\nin limine, Petitioner mentioned that he had not received a copy of the email that contained the\nphotograph sent to Terry and to Detective Horsman. (/d.) Still, Petitioner did not object, request\nthe document, or ask for more time to investigate the identification. Ud.)\n\nThe State introduced the photograph of Petitioner received by Terry during the hearing\non the motion in limine. (Id. at21) At the same hearing, Terry testified that Boone came to the\nhospital and showed him Petitioner\u2019s photograph on her phone. (id. at 26-27) Boone had\nobtained the photograph from Facebook and, after showing it to Terry, she sent the photo to\nTerry\u2019s phone. (Jd. at 28) Detective Horsman testified that, at some point after Boone\u2019s visit to\nTerry, he viewed the photograph on Terry\u2019s phone and also spoke with Boone on Terry\u2019s phone.\n(id. at 23-34) Boone then emailed a copy of the photo to Detective Horsman. (id. at 22)\n\nTrial counsel cross-examined Terry extensively during the hearing on the motion in\nlimine, asking what Boone had told him about Petitioner and why she thought Petitioner was the\n\nperson who had shot him (Terry). (/d. at 29-33) According to Terry, Boone told him that she\n\n25\n\nhad heard from others in the neighborhood that Petitioner was bragging about having shot him.\n(id. at 30-31)\n\nOn direct appeal, Petitioner argued that the State violated Brady v. Maryland by not\nproviding defense counsel with Boone\u2019s identity, the photograph of Petitioner, or the email\nBoone sent to Detective Horsman with Petitioner\u2019s photo prior to the motion in limine hearing.\n(D.I. 15-2 at 22-23) Petitioner further argued that the delay in disclosure prevented trial counsel\nfrom interviewing Boone prior to trial and/or from examining either Boone\u2019s or Terry\u2019s phones.\n(Id, at 24) The Delaware Supreme Court denied Petitioner\u2019s Brady argument, finding:\n\nWhile Boone's identity could arguably have been used for some\nimpeachment purpose, the State did not suppress her identity and no\nprejudice resulted. The police report provided to [Petitioner] under\nRule 16(a)(1) stated: \u201cThe victim was able to identify the suspect\nthrough the photographed [sic] provided to him from a family\nmember who wished to stay anonymous.\u201d As noted earlier,\n[Petitioner] did not ask the State to reveal the identity of the family\nmember or file any motion seeking the identity of the family\nmember.\n\n[Petitioner] also argues that the State belatedly disclosed Boone's\nidentity on the eve of trial. \u201cWhen a defendant is confronted with\ndelayed disclosure of Brady material, reversal will be granted only\nif the defendant was denied the opportunity to use the material\neffectively.\u201d Once again, [Petitioner] did not ask for the identity of\nthe person who supplied the photograph, despite knowing as early\nas June 5, 2014 that such a person existed. [Petitioner] did learn of\nBoone's identity at the January 12, 2015 hearing on his motion to\nsuppress the identification, yet he did not ask for a continuance or\notherwise claim that the late disclosure caused prejudice to the\ndefense. At trial, [Petitioner] cross-examined Terry on the details of\nBoone's role in his identification, and had every opportunity to\nundermine and cast doubt on the validity of the identification.\n[Petitioner] has therefore failed to demonstrate a Brady violation.\n\nGoode, 136 A.3d at 313.\n\n26\nIn this case, Petitioner again contends that the State violated Brady v. Maryland by not\nproviding trial counsel with Boone\u2019s identity, the photograph, or the email Boone sent to\nDetective Horsman containing Petitioner\u2019s photograph prior to the motion in limine hearing.\nSince the Delaware Supreme Court rejected this argument as meritless, the instant Brady claim\nwill only warrant relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. .\n\nThe clearly established federal law governing the State\u2019s disclosure requirements to a\ndefendant is articulated in Brady v. Maryland and its progeny. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland,\n\u201c[p]rosecutors have an affirmative duty \u2018to disclose [Brady] evidence ... even though there has\nbeen no request [for the evidence] by the accused,\u2019 which may include evidence known only to\npolice.\u201d Dennis v. Sec\u2019y, Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 834 F.3d 263, 284 (3d Cir. 2016). \u201cTo comply\nwith Brady, prosecutors must \u2018learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the\ngovernment\u2019s behalf.\u201d Jd. In order to prevail on a Brady v. Maryland claim, a petitioner must\nestablish that: (1) the evidence at issue was favorable to the accused, either because it was\nexculpatory or it had impeachment value; (2) the prosecution suppressed the evidence, \u201ceither\nwillfully or inadvertently;\u201d and (3) the evidence was material. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S.\n263, 281-82 (1999); Lambert v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d 210, 252 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nHere, the Delaware Supreme Court correctly identified Brady as the applicable law and\nalso reasonably applied Brady in holding that the State did not suppress the evidence at issue.\nDetective Horsman\u2019s report was provided to Petitioner months before trial, and the report\n\nexplained how a member of Terry\u2019s family who wished to remain anonymous had provided the\n\n27\n\nphotograph. Despite knowing about the photo and anonymous family member, Petitioner never\nrequested or filed a motion to discover the family member\u2019s identity.\n\nIn turn, even assuming Boone\u2019s name constituted exculpatory or impeachment evidence,\nthe delayed disclosure of her name did not violate Brady because Petitioner was able to\neffectively use that information to undermine and cast doubt on Terry\u2019s identification of\nPetitioner. See United States v. Higgs, 713 F.2d 39, 43-44 (3d Cir. 1983) (when there is a\ndelayed disclosure of Brady material \u201cthat defendants could use on cross-examination to\nchallenge the credibility of Government witnesses,\u201d due process is not violated if the material\nwas disclosed in time for the defendant to effectively use the material at trial.). Boone\u2019s identity,\nthe photograph, and the information Boone may have told Terry was relevant only to challenge\nthe reliability of Terry\u2019s identification of Petitioner as the shooter. Although Petitioner did not\nknow Boone\u2019s identity until the day before trial began, once he knew her identity, he fully and\neffectively cross-examined Terry both at trial and in the hearing on the motion in limine about\nthe effect Boone\u2019s beliefs may have had on his identification of Petitioner.\n\nPresumably in an attempt to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s late\ndisclosure, Petitioner has filed an affidavit from Petitioner\u2019s girlfriend asserting that Boone \u201chad\nulterior motives\u201d for giving the photograph to Terry. (D.I. 11 at 24-25) According to the\naffidavit, Boone \u201charbor[ed] an animus grudge against Petitioner, based on Boone\u2019s personal\ndislike of Petitioner, and vow of vengeance against him, predic[a]ted on a dispute that Boone\nwas involved in regarding her dissolved friendship with Petitioner\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 25)\nAlthough the affidavit is dated February 6, 2015, Petitioner did not present the affidavit to the\n\nDelaware Supreme Court during his direct appeal or during his post-conviction proceeding.\n\n28\n\n\u201c{R]eview under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181 (2011). Given\nPetitioner\u2019s failure to explain his failure to introduce the affidavit in his earlier state court\nproceedings, the Court will not consider the affidavit in its instant Brady analysis.\n\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court did not\nunreasonably apply clearly established federal law in rejecting Petitioner\u2019s Brady argument.\nTherefore, the Court will deny the instant sub-argument of Claim Four for failing to satisfy the\nstandard articulated in \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n3. Trial counsel did not request Boone\u2019s identity\n\nPetitioner also asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request Boone\u2019s\nidentity at an earlier time. (D.I. 11 at 20-27) Petitioner did not present this ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel allegation to the Delaware state courts in his Rule 61 proceeding. At\nthis juncture, if Petitioner tried to raise the instant ineffective assistance of trial counsel\nallegation in a new Rule 61 motion in the Superior Court, the motion would be barred as\nuntimely under Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(1). See Folks v. Phelps, 2009 WL\n498008, at *12 (D. Del. Feb. 26, 2009). Since there is no indication that Rule 61(d)(2)\u2019s or\n\n(i)(5)\u2019s exceptions to the bar in Rule 61(i)(1) and (2) apply in this case,* any attempt to exhaust\n\n8Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(d)(2) and (i)(5) provide that the procedural bars to\nrelief in Rule 61(i)(1), (2), (3), and (4) do not apply to a claim that the court lacked jurisdiction\nor if the petitioner pleads with particularity either that (1) new evidence exists that creates a\nstrong inference that he is actually innocent or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made\nretroactive on collateral review, applies to his case and renders his conviction invalid. See Del.\nSuper. Ct. Cr. R. 61(d)(2) and (i)(5). Petitioner does not allege a valid claim of actual innocence,\nand he does not allege a lack of jurisdiction or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to his\nclaims.\n\n29\n\nstate remedies would be futile. Given this futility, the Court must treat the instant argument as\ntechnically exhausted but procedurally defaulted. Therefore, the Court cannot review the merits\nof this sub-argument of Claim Four absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or that a\nmiscarriage of justice will result absent such review.\n\nPetitioner does not allege any cause for, or prejudice resulting from, his procedural\ndefault. He also does not assert that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the argument is not\nreviewed. Accordingly, the Court will deny the instant ineffective assistance of trial counsel\nargument as procedurally barred.\n\n4. Confrontation Clause\n\nAs previously discussed, Terry testified on direct examination that individuals were going\naround town bragging about how they shot him, and Terry testified on cross-examination that\nBoone was the source of that information. (D.I. 15-3 at 43-44, 46) On direct appeal, Petitioner\nargued that Boone\u2019s words and actions were expressed at trial through Terry and Detective\nHorsman in violation of the Confrontation Clause. The Delaware Supreme Court denied the\nConfrontation Clause argument as meritless. Therefore, the instant argument will only warrant\nrelief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law.\n\nThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides, in relevant part, that \u201cin all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the ... right to be confronted with the witnesses\nagainst him.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI. In Crawford v. Washington, 541 US. 36 (2004), and its\nprogeny, the United States Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars the admission\n\nof testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial that are admitted to establish the truth of\n\n30\n\nthe matter asserted in the statement, unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant\nhad a prior opportunity for cross-examination. See Crawford, 541 US. at 59, 60 n. 9; see also\nDavis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 823-24 (2006). A testimonial statement is a statement that is\nmade during non-emergency circumstances and which the declarant would objectively foresee\nmight be used in the investigation or prosecution of a crime. See United States v. Hinton, 423\nF.3d 355, 360 (3d Cir. 2005); Davis, 547 U.S. at 822.\n\nIn Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009), the Supreme Court noted, \u201cThe\nright to confrontation may, of course, be waived, including by failure to object to the offending\nevidence[.]\u201d Jd. at 314 n.3 (2009). The Third Circuit has further held that, absent the defendant\u2019s\ndissent, the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights can be waived through his attorney\u2019s \u201clegitimate\ntrial tactic or [...] prudent trial strategy.\u201d United States v. Williams, 403 F. App\u2019x 707, 708-09\n(3d Cir. 2010) (holding that the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s decision to stipulate to the introduction of\nlaboratory test waived the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights because there was no evidence in the\nrecord that the defendant dissented from his counsel\u2019s stipulation and the decision was prudent,\nstrategic, and did not constitute ineffective assistance).\n\nWhen denying Petitioner\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument and affirming his conviction\non direct appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court opined:\n\n[T]he State did not violate the Confrontation Clause by presenting\nBoone\u2019s testimony through Terry and Detective Horsman. In certain\nsituations the Confrontation Clause prohibits the use of testimonial\nhearsay in criminal trials. But Detective Horsman never testified to\nanything that Boone said. Although Terry did begin to repeat things\nthat Boone had said, the Superior Court quickly halted the testimony\nand instructed the jury to disregard his statements. In this situation,\nthe trial judge's prompt instruction for the jury to disregard the\nstatements cured any error. Further, it was [Petitioner] who later on\n\ncross-examination elicited testimony about what Boone said.\n\n31\n\n[Petitioner] has thus waived any claim that his rights under the\nConfrontation Clause were violated.\n\nGoode, 136 A.3d at 313. The Delaware Supreme Court's denial of Petitioner's Confrontation\nClause claim was not contrary to clearly established federal law, because the Delaware Supreme\nCourt cited and applied Crawford in reaching its decision.\n\nThe Court also concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was based on a\nreasonable determination of facts and involved a reasonable application of Crawford and its\nprogeny. The record supports the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s factual findings that Detective\nHorsman did not testify to anything that Boone had said, and that the Superior Court interrupted\nTerry\u2019s recitation of Boone\u2019s statements and instructed the jury to disregard Terry\u2019s disclosures.\n(D.I. 15-3 at 18-19, 44; D.I. 15-5 at 69-70)\n\nThe Court also concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied federal\nlaw in concluding that Petitioner waived his Confrontation Clause argument. The record shows\nthat trial counsel extensively cross-examined Terry about Boone\u2019s statements to him, and this\nCourt has already concluded that trial counsel\u2019s decision regarding such cross-examination was\nnot outside the range of professionally competent assistance. See supra at IIL.C. Accordingly,\nthe Court will deny Petitioner\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\n\nand (2).\n\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether\nto issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011). A certificate of\nappealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a\nconstitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s\n\n32\nassessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); Slack v.\nMcDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief. In the Court\u2019s\nview, reasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the Court\ndeclines to issue a certificate of appealability.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the Petition must be denied. An\n\nappropriate Order will be entered.\n\n33\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nJHAVON R.
