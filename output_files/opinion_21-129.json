(\u201cBirdeye\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d) , presently pending before the Court \nis Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \n(\u201cMotion\u201d) .  (D.I. 44)  For the reasons set forth  below, the Court recommends that the  Motion be  \nGRANTED.   \nI. BACKGROUND \n A. Factual Background  \nIn the operative First Amended Complaint  (\u201cFAC\u201d) , Plaintiff accuses aspects of \nDefendant \u2019s reputation management platform  of infringing at least claim s 1, 12 and 16 of United \nStates Patent No. 8,918,312 (the \u201c'312 patent\u201d) , at least claim s 18, 31 and 32 of United States \nPatent No. 10,180,966 (the \u201c'966 patent\u201d) , at least claims  13 and 14 of United States Patent No.  \n10,354,296 ( the \u201c'296 patent\u201d)  and at least claim s 19, 30 and 31 of United States Patent No. \n10,445,794 (the \u201c'794 patent\u201d) .  (D.I. 33 at \u00b6\u00b6 116- 71)   Further relevant facts related to \nresolution of the Motion will be set out as needed in Section III.    \n B. Procedural Background  2 \n Plaintiff  filed its  original  Complaint on February  1, 2021.  (D.I. 1)  The FAC was filed on \nApril 27, 2021.  (D.I. 33)  On May 18, 2021, United States District Judge Leonard P. Stark  \nreferred the case to Court to hear and resolve all pre -trial matters up to and including expert \ndiscovery matters .  (D.I. 50)   \nThe instant Moti on was filed on Ma y 11, 2021, (D.I. 44 ), and briefing  was completed on \nJune 1, 2021, (D.I. 57) .  The Court heard oral argument on the Motion at a hearing (\u201cthe \nhearing\u201d) held on October 29, 2021.  ( See Transcript of October 29, 2021 Hearing, or \u201cTr.\u201d)1 \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nThe i nstant Rule 12(b)(6) Motion is premised on Defendant\u2019s assertion that the FAC \nshould be dismissed due to the applicability of an affirmative defense:  that the patent claim s-in-\nsuit are directed to patent -ineligible subject matter  pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (\u201cSection 101\u201d) .  \nThe Court has often set out the relevant legal standards for review of such a Rule \n12(b)(6)/Section 101 motion, including in Genedics, LLC v. Meta Co., Civil Action No. 17-\n1062- CJB, 2018 WL 3991474, at *2- 5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2018).  It hereby incorporates by \nreference its discussion in Genedics  of these relevant legal standards and will follow this legal \nguidance in assessing the Motion.  To the extent that other, related legal principles are relevant to \nthe Motion, the Court will discuss those below in Section III.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThere are four patents -in-suit implicated by the instant Motion.  The Court will address \nthem in turn .  \nA. The ' 296 Patent  \n \n1  At that same hearing, t he Court also heard argument on Plaintiff\u2019s motion for \npreliminary injunction .  (D.I. 48)   The Court recently recommended that this preliminary \ninjunction motion be denied on unrelated grounds .  (D.I. 123)   3 \n The '296 patent is entitled \u201c Follow -up Determination.\u201d  ('296 patent at 1)2  Generally \nspeaking, it relates to  following up with a potential online review author if that person has  not yet \nauthored a review .  The Court will assess the eligibility only of  asserted claim 1 3, as it considers \nthat claim to be  representative.3  Claim 13 recites  the following:  \n13.  A method, comprising:  \n \nfacilitating, by an interface, a transmission of a review request to a potentia l author of a review on a revie w site, wherein the review \nrequest is included within a first electronic message ; \n determining, by a follow -up engine configured to monitor the \nreview site, that the potential review author has not , subsequent to \nthe transmission, authored a review on the review site monitored by the follow -up engine, and in response determining a  follow -up \naction to take with the potential review author regarding the review request, wherein determining the follow -up action to take includes \ndetermining that a modification should be made to the first \nelectronic message, and  wherein determining that the modification \nshould be made includes at leas t one of:  (1) determining that a \nsubject of the first electronic message should be modified, and (2) \ndetermining that content of the first electronic message should be \nmodified ; and \n \nperforming the determined follow -up action, wherein performing \nthe determined follow -up action includes sending a second \nelectronic message, and w herein the second electronic message \ncorresponds to a modified version of the first electronic message . \n \n('296 patent , col. 25: 31-54)    \n1. Alice \u2019s Step One  \n \n2  All four patents -in-suit are attached as exhibits to the FAC.  (D.I. 33, exs. A -D)  \nHerein, the Cour t will cite to the patents by their patent number.   \n \n3  Defendant\u2019s view is that claim 13 is representative as to this patent.  (Defendant\u2019s \nHearing Presentation, Slide 2)  In its answering brief, Plaintiff does  not take issue with this \nassertion .  (D.I. 55 at 7-14; D.I. 57 at 2 n.2)   The Court, therefore, will treat claim 13 as \nrepresentative of the asserted claims o f this patent.    4 \n The Court first assesses Alice \u2019s step one, which asks whether the claim at issue is \n\u201cdirected to\u201d an abstract idea.  What is an abstract idea?  It can be (but is not necessarily limited \nto) a \u201cpreexisting, fundamental truth\u201d that \u201cexis[ts] in principle apart from any human action[,]\u201d \nor it can be a \u201cmethod of organizing human activity\u201d (such as a \u201clongstanding commercial \npractice\u201d).   Alice  Corp. Pty.  Ltd. v.  CLS  Bank  Int\u2019l , 573 U.S.  208, 220 (2014)  (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted); see also DDR  Holdings, LLC  v. Hotels.co m, L.P. , 773 F.3d 1245, \n1256- 57 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  A claim to an abstract idea has been described by the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as one directed to a \u201c\u2018disembodied\u2019 concept . . . a basic \nbuilding block of human ingenuity, unt ethered from any real -world application.\u201d   CLS  Bank  Int\u2019l \nv. Alice  Corp. Pty.  Ltd., 717 F.3d 1269, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (Lourie, J., concurring) (citation \nomitted).  Beyond that, the \u201c abstract  ideas \u201d category has not been crisply  defined , see Alice , 573 \nU.S. at 221 (declining to \u201clabor to delimit the precise contours of the \u2018 abstract  ideas \u2019 category\u201d), \nand the Supreme Court of the United States and the Federal Circuit have found it sufficient to \ncompare claims at issue to those claims already found to  be directed to an  abstract  idea in \nprevious cases,  see Enfish LLC v. Microsoft Corp. , 822 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2016) . \n   Defendant argues that  claim 13  is directed to the abstract idea of  \u201crequesting that an \nindividual write a review of a business and sending a follow -up message if they do not write a \nreview.\u201d  ( D.I. 45 at 7; Defendant\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 15)   This is so, Defendant notes, \nbecause \u201c[it] broadly claim [s] an abstract result, without reciting a technological solution to any \ntechnological problem [,]\u201d (D.I. 45 at 9) , and simply contains  \u201cfunctional , results -oriented \nlimitations [,]\u201d (Defendant\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 18  (emphasis omitted) ).  (S ee also  D.I. \n45 at 9- 10; Tr. at 247- 48)  In effect, in Defendant\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he claims attempt to monopolize 5 \n the mere transfer of information [.]\u201d  (Defendant\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 18; see also  D.I. \n57 at 8)   \nIn response, Plaintiff does not dispute that \u201c requesting that an individual write a review \nof a business and sending a follow -up message if they do not write a review\u201d is an abstract idea.  \nBut it argue s that claim 13 is  not actually \u201cdirected to\u201d that concept .  (D.I. 55 at 7- 11; see also  \nD.I. 109- 1 at 14 )  Plaintiff asserts that  the claim  is instead  \u201cdirected to improvements to the \ncapability  [of] the systems that support  online reviews and reputation management systems as a \nwhole [.]\u201d  (D.I. 55 at 18)  \nSo is claim 13 actually directed to  the abstract idea at issue?  When one looks at the \nclaim\u2019s language, it sure seems so .  Most of the content in c laim 1 3 describes  a method that :  (1) \nsends a request  via an electronic message to a potential review author  asking them to author a \nreview on a specific review  website ; (2) later determin es that the potential review author has not  \nin fact  authored a review on the specific website;  (3) also determin es that a follow -up action is \nneeded; and (4) s ends a (modified ) follow -up email  to the potential review author .  ('296 patent , \ncol. 25:31- 54)  These components of the claim largely consist of functional language , and \ndescribe a high- level process of collecting and analyzing information\u2014as opposed to any \nparticular assertedly inventive technology used to perform those functions.  See Elec. Power \nGrp. v. Alstom S.A ., 830 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  \nThe specification  also supports Defendant\u2019s argument .4  The title of the patent  (\u201cFollow -\nup Determ ination \u201d) suggest s that it is simply about the concept of following up with a reviewer \n \n4   In order to det ermine what a patent claim is really \u201cdirected to\u201d at step one, the \nFederal Circuit has encouraged district courts to consider the content of the patent\u2019s \nspecification.  Cf. Enfish , 822 F.3d at 1337 (indicating that it is appropriate to look to a patent\u2019s  \nspecification to determine whether a claim of the patent is \u201cdirected to\u201d a particular concept, and that if a claim contains a particular element that is described by the patent\u2019s specification as what 6 \n to make sure they write a review.  Moreover, the patent\u2019s  Abstract very neatly tracks the outline \nof the asserted abstract idea (and does not  suggest that some more specific, real -world \napplication of tha t idea is at play) :   \nThe transmission of a review request to a potential author of a \nreview of a review site is facilitated.  A determination is made that the potential reviewer has not, subsequent to the transmission, authored a review on the review site.  A follow -up action to take \nwith the potential reviewer regarding the review request is determined.   \n \n('296 patent  at Abstract )  And while the specification describes a problem that the invention is \nmeant to help f ix (i.e., the fact that \u201cboth positive and negative reviews posted to a review \nwebsite can impact revenue\u201d but that \u201cit is becoming increasingly difficult for businesses to \nmonitor [review web]sites\u201d),  the Court does not see where it ever describes a speci fic, \ntechnological  solution to that problem .  (Id., col. 1:24- 25, 27- 28)    \nNor is Plaintiff\u2019s step one argument to the contrary very persuasive.  In its briefing, \nPlaintiff des cribes the problem t he patent means to address as follows:   \u201cmany potential \nreviewers simply ignore review requests  and others decline to take the time to proceed to a \nreview website to provide a review.\u201d  (D.I. 55 at 8  (citing D.I. 33 at \u00b6 29) )  Plaintiff then offers \nthat the way the patent addresses that issue  is by \u201cfacilitating transmission of a review request to \nan individual who has patronized the business, and then determining whether follow -up is \nnecessary (including by modifying the subject of the original request ).\u201d  (Id. (citing D.I. 33 at \u00b6 \n \nthe \u201cpresent invention comprises[,]\u201d this suggests that the claim may be directed to that element \nor concept) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc. , 790 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2015)  (same, and noting that if a concept is \ndescribed in the patent as  being \u201cthe innovation over the prior art\u201d or the \u201cessential, most \nimportant aspect\u201d of the patented invention, that suggests that the claim is directed to that concept) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n 7 \n 30))  But t hat is l argely just a restatement of the abstract idea at issue.  A nd though Plaintiff\u2019s \ncounsel argued that the \u201cpatent as a whole is clearly trying to solve technological problems \u201d by \nway of an \u201cimproved review request functionality[,]\u201d counsel never persuasively pointed to \nclaim language that describes  how  the invention accomplishes this by way of promoting a \ntechnological solution to those problems .  (Tr. at 277) ; McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. \nInc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (noting that at step one, a court looks to whether the \nclaims  \u201cfocus on a specific means or method that improves the relevant technology or are instead \ndirected to a result or effect that itself is the abstract idea  and merely invoke generic processes \nand machine ry\u201d); Enfish , 822 F.3d at  1335- 36 (noting that a t step one , a court asks \u201cwhether the \nfocus of the claims is on a specific asserted improvement in computer capabilities . . . or, instead, on a process that qualifies as an \u2018abstract idea\u2019 for which computers are invoked merely as a tool\u201d).\n5   \n \n5  Plaintiff\u2019s other step one arguments are not availing.  For example, Plaintiff \nasserts that claim 13 must not be directed to an abstract idea because \u201c[i]n effect, the '296 \n[p]atent as a whole helps the systems of online reviews and online reputation management work better\u201d or because D efendant \u201cpresented no evidence that the processes previously used by \nbusinesses soliciting reviews are the same as the process required by the claims.\u201d  (D.I. 55 at 8 -9)  \nBut just because use of a claimed method might lead  to a helpful , or even novel , outcome does  \nnot necessarily mean that the claim is patent eligible.  If that claim is one to an abstract idea (as opposed to a specific, real-world application of that idea ) then its potential usefulness or its \nnovelty will not save it .  See Ficep Corp. v. Peddinghaus Corp., Civil Action No. 19- 1994- RGA, \n2021 WL 254104, at *3 (D. Del. Jan. 26, 2021), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 WL 979564 (D. Del. Mar. 16, 2021) .   \n Additionally, Plaintiff argues that the claim cannot be directed to an abstract  idea because \nit \u201cprovides [a] solution to problems rooted in online reputation management technology\u201d and is not \u201cdirected to performance of some business practice known in the pre -Internet world[.]\u201d  (D.I. \n55 at 9)  Yet \u201climiting the use of an abstract idea to a particular technological environment\u201d does not make a claim any less abstract.  Alice , 573 U.S. at 223 (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted) ; Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp., 838 F.3d 1307, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2016) \n(\u201c[P]erformance of an abstract idea on the Internet is abstract[.]\u201d) .  Now, if the claim was really \ndirected to a solution \u201crooted in computer technology[,]\u201d as the FAC asserts in conclusory fashion, (D.I. 33 at \u00b6 34), then it would likely pass muster under step one .  The reality, however, 8 \n For the above reasons, the Court agrees with Defendant that claim 13 is directed to an \nabstract idea.  (D.I. 45 at 9) ; see also  Glasswall Sols. Ltd. v. Clearswift Ltd., 754 F. App\u2019 x 996, \n998 (Fed. Cir. 2018) .  The Court thus moves to step two of the inquiry. \n2. Alice\u2019s Step Two  \nIf a claim is  directed to an abstract idea, then step two of the Alice  framework requires a \ncourt to assess \u201c[w]hat else is there in the claims\u201d; a court does so by considering \u201cthe elements \nof each claim both individually and \u2018as an ordered combination\u2019 to determine whether the additional elements transform the nature of th e claim into a patent -eligible application.\u201d  Alice , \n573 U.S. at 2 17 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Supreme Court describes \nstep two as a search for an \u201cinventive concept\u201d \u2014\u201ci.e., an element or combination of elements \nthat is sufficie nt to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent \nupon the [ineligible concept] itself.\u201d  Id.  at 217- 18 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted); s ee also Berkheimer  v. HP Inc. , 881 F.3d 1360, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2018) .  The purpose of \nthe \u201cinventive concept\u201d requirement is to \u201censure that the claim is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the abstract idea.\u201d  Alice , 573 U.S. at 221 (internal quotation marks, \ncitation, and brackets omitted).\n6 \n \nis that claim 13 is focused on a n abstract idea\u2014one  that simply happens to be utilized in an \nInternet -based environment.    \n \n6  Simply stating an abstract idea and then adding the words \u201capply it with a \ncomputer\u201d  (or the equivalent thereof)  will not  transform an abstract idea into a patent -eligible \ninvention.  Alice , 573 U.S. at 223 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And the additional \nelements within the claim, apart from the abstract idea itself, must involve more than \u201c\u2018well -\nunderstood, routine, conventional activit[ies]\u2019 previously known to the industry.\u201d  Id. at 225 \n(quoting Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 73 (2012)); see also  \nMayo , 566 U.S. at 82 (\u201c[S]imply appending conventional steps, specified at a high level of \ngenerality, to . . . abstract ideas cannot make those  . . . ideas patentable.\u201d).  \n 9 \n In exploring this step two question, the Court is mindful that although a determination of \npatent eligibility is ultimately an issue of law, the determination may involve \u201cdisputes over \nunderlying facts.\u201d  Berkheimer , 881 F.3d at 1368.  One such factual issue is \u201c[w]he ther [a claim \nelement or claimed combination] is well- understood, routine, and conventional to a skilled \nartisan at the time of the patent[.]\u201d  Id. at 1369.7   \nIn its answering brief, Plaintiff never really clearly states what aspects of the claim do, in \nfact, amount to an  inventive concept.  (D.I. 55 at 11- 14)  At one point  though, Plain tiff make s \nreference to claim 13\u2019s inclusion of a \u201cfollow -up engine\u201d ; in doing so, Plaintiff  appears to take \nissue with Defendant\u2019s claim that th at term is merely a  \u201cblack box\u201d \u2014i.e., one  devoid of limiting \nstructure.  ( Id. at 12)  Yet Plaintiff never suggests any proposed claim  construction for \u201cfollow -\nup engine\u201d that would require some sort of particularized software or hardware limitation s.  And \nwhen the \u201cfollow -up engine\u201d is described in the specification (as \u201cfollow -up engine 2004\u201d) it is \nreferred to  only in terms of the results it generates  (results that basically amount to re -statements \nof the abstract idea) \u2014not in terms of what it consists of , or how, specifically, it is actually able \nto generate those results .  ('296 patent , cols. 21:55- 23:06 (noting that in certain embodiments, \n\u201c[f]ollow -up engine 2004  can be configured to determine . . . how many of the targeted \n \n7  Alleged improvements to the prior art described in a patent\u2019s specification and \n\u201ccaptured in the claims\u201d can \u201ccreate a factual d ispute regarding whether the invention describes \nwell-understood, routine, and conventional activities\u201d \u2014thus precluding either summary \njudgment, Berkheimer , 881 F.3d at 1369, or dismissal at the Rule 12 stage, see B ASCOM  Glob. \nInternet Servs., Inc. v.

Spotify Tech. S.A ., 484 F. Supp. 3d 188, 201 (D. Del. Sept. 8, 2020) (\u201cPointing \nto a \u2018proprietary format\u2019 essentially points to a black box, which does nothing to demonstrate how the claims are encoded such that they represent an improvement in the technology or innovation over conventional functionality.\u201d).  So the claim\u2019s inclusion of a \u201cfollow -up engine\u201d \ndoes not save it from ineligibility.\n8   \nPlaintiff  makes one other identifiable step two argument.  Q uoting from the FAC, it notes \nthat:  (1) during prosecution of the '296 patent , the applicant amended the patent\u2019s claims  in \nresponse to a Section 101 rejection; and (2) the reafter, the Examiner concluded that he \u201cno \nlonger believe [d] that the claims are well- understood, routine, or conventional\u201d and that the \nindependent claims of the patent \u201cinclude specific limitations for improving online reputation by automatically facilitating user reviews on a specified review site, which are not well- understood, \nroutine nor conventional in the field; are integrated into a practical application; and/or add unconventional steps that confine the claim to a particular useful application.\u201d  (D.I. 33 at \u00b6  39 \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (cited in D.I. 55 at 13); see also  D.I. 55, ex. A)  Plaintiff \n \n8  The concern that drives the principle that abstract ideas cannot be patented is \u201cone \nof pre -emption.\u201d  Alice , 573 U.S. at 216.  In  light of the apparent breadth of claim 13, that \nconcern is  heightened  here .  The Court agrees with Defendant that the claim appears to cover \nnearly \u201c every method for electronically requesting that someone write a review and following up \nwith a different request after a period of time.\u201d  (D.I. 45 at 9  (emphasis in original) ); see a lso Tr. \nat 248))   11 \n asserts that, in light of this, \u201c a fact question exists as to whether, as t he Examiner found, the \nclaims are \u2018significantly more than an abstract idea. \u2019\u201d  (D.I. 55 at 12)   \nThe Court is not persuaded.  Obviously, the fact that the Examiner did not  find claim 13 \nto be patent  ineligible is not binding on the Court , and it does not end the Court\u2019s inquiry here.  \nSee Elec. Co mmc\u2019ns Techs., LLC v. ShoppersChoice.com, LLC , 958 F.3d 1178, 1183 (Fed. Cir. \n2020).  Moreover, the Examiner provided no further analysis  or explanation in support of his \nconclusion, other than the few conclusory statements quoted above .  The absence of any factual  \nrationale in support of th at conclusion hurts Plaintiff\u2019s argument here.  (D.I. 55, ex. A  at \u00b6 7; Tr. \nat 246) ; cf. S.I.SV.E.L. Societa Italiana per lo Sviluppo Dell\u2019Elettronica S.p.A. v. Rhaps ody Int\u2019l, \nInc., Civil Action No. 18- 69-MN-CJB, Civil Action No. 18- 70-MN-CJB, 2019 WL 1102683, at \n*10 (D. Del. Mar. 8, 2019).  But m ost importantly, the thing that the Examiner is citing as not \nbeing \u201cwell -understood, routine nor conventional in the field\u201d \u2014i.e., \u201cspecific limitations for \nimproving online reputation by automatically facilitating user reviews on a specified review \nsite\u201d\u2014appears to be little more than a  re-statement  of the abstract idea at issue .  (D.I. 55, ex. A at \n\u00b6 7)  Claim 13 cannot be patent eligible if  \u201cthe only possible inventive concept in the [claim] is \nthe abstract idea itself[.]\u201d  ChargePoint, Inc. v. SemaConnect, Inc ., 920 F.3d 759, 775 (Fed Cir. \n2019) .  And the C ourt cannot  identify any other more \u201cspecific limitations\u201d in claim 13 that \nmight amount to the inventive concept here ( nor did the Examiner  specify what those limitations \npurportedly were).  For these reasons, the Examiner\u2019s bare -bones statement does not help \nestablish a factual dispute at step two .9 \n \n9  As is the case with regard to each of the other three patents -in-suit, Plaintiff did \nnot cite to any expert testimony regarding Section 101 issues in the FAC (nor in exhibits attached \nthereto).  (Tr. at 243)   12 \n For all of the reasons set out above, the Court concludes that claim 13 does not contain an \ninventive concept .  It therefore  recommends that the asserted claims of the '296 patent  be found \nto be patent ineligible.   \nB. The ' 794 Patent  \nThe ' 794 patent  is entitled \u201c SMS -Based Review Requests. \u201d  ('794 p atent at 1)  G enerally \nspeaking, it relates to directing willing potential review authors where to write a review of a \nbusiness or company on a specific review website .  The Court will assess the eligibility of  claim \n19 below , as it finds that claim to be representative.10  Claim 19 recites  the following:  \n19.  A method, comprising:  \n \nobtaining contact information associated with a potential reviewer ; \n transmitting , using the obtained contact information, a message \nrequesting the potential reviewer to write a review for an entity;  \n in response to receiving an indication that the potential reviewer has accepted the request to write the review for the entity, dynamically  determining, using one or  more processors and from a \nplurality of review websites , a review website on which the \npotential reviewer should be directed to  write the review for the \nentity; and  \n directing a device associated with the potential reviewer to a profile page of the entity on the review website dynamically \ndetermined from the plurality of review websites.  \n \n('794 patent, col  41:1-16)  \n1. Alice \u2019s Step One  \nDefendant argues that claim 19 is directed to the abstract idea of  \u201crequesting that an \nindividual write a review of a business and, after they accept the request, directing them where \n \n10  Defendant asserts that claim 19 is representative.  (Defendant\u2019s Hearing \nPresentation, Slide 2)  In its briefing, Plaintiff d oes not  contest that assertion.  (D.I. 55 at 14- 18)   13 \n they should submit the review.\u201d  (D.I. 45 at 11; Tr. at 251; Defendant\u2019s Hearing Presentation, \nSlide 40)  Plaintiff does not dispute that this is an abstract idea .  It counters that the claim is not \nin fact directed to that idea , and that instead  it \u201crepresents another improvement to the systems \nthat support online reviews and reputation management systems as a whole.\u201d   (D.I. 55 at 14)    \nAt first glance, claim 1 9 does seem like it is directed simply to \u201crequesting that an \nindividual write a review of a business and, after they accept the request, directing them where they should submit the review .\u201d  Most of its text speaks to that broad conc ept.  That is, as noted \nabove, the claim largely describes  (using functional language ) how the method:  (1) send s a \nmessage to a potential reviewer asking them to write an online review for a specific business; (2) somehow determin es the review site  on which the  reviewer should author a review ; (3) somehow \ndirects the reviewer\u2019s device to a specific review website, so that he or she can author the review .  \n('794 patent, col 41:1- 16)   \n The Court next turns to the specification.  In the \u201cBackground of  the Invention\u201d section, \nthe patent  explain s that the problem it hopes to solve has to do with getting more business \ncustomers to write onl ine reviews :   \nBusinesses are increasingly concerned with their online \nreputations.  For example, both positive and negative reviews  \nposted to a review website can impact revenue.  As more review \nwebsites are created , and more users post more content to th ose \nsites, it is becoming increasingly  difficult for businesses to monitor \nsuch sites .  Further, it can be challenging for businesses to generate \nreviews for the business\u2019s profile pages .  For example, customers \nof the business may become busy or find it inconvenient to write reviews.  \n \n('794 patent, col. 1: 13-21; see also  Tr. at 270)   Later, the patent notes that \u201c[t]ypically it may be \ndifficult for users to leave reviews, for example, because it is time -consuming to find and open \nreview sites for a business, or because the mobile experience for leaving reviews on a review site 14 \n is poor.\u201d  ( '794 patent, col. 6:38- 42)  And the patent  further suggests that \u201c[t]he mechanisms \ndescribed [in the  patent ] can reduce the friction in obtaining reviews on mobile devices, \nencouraging users to write reviews and increasing the conversion rate for a business . . . to \ngenerat e reviews.\u201d  ( Id., col. 6:42- 45; see also  D.I. 33 at \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43)   Here again, the ethos behi nd \nthe patent seems to be descried in an abstract and fairly high- level  way :  i.e., \u201cIt sure is hard to \nget customers to write online reviews for a business.  Let\u2019s try to get them to do that.\u201d     \nWith all that said, there are other portions of the patent that hint at what could  be a more \nnarrow focus.  For example, the t itle of the patent is \u201c SMS -Based Review Requests .\u201d  This  \nindicates that a Short M essage Service (\u201cSMS\u201d) -based request \u2014rather than just a request  sent by \nany means \u2014might  be an important component of what the patent is about .  The specification \nfurther notes that \u201cShort Message Service (SMS )/Mobile -Email- based review requests provide a \nway for entities such as businesses to have reviews on their online business pages by leveraging mobile technology\u201d a nd that \u201cSMS -based review requests can provide an alternative by \nleveraging, for example, mobile applications  (\u2018apps \u2019) installed on an end- user\u2019s device together \nwith a business\u2019s profile pages to entice or encourage customers to leave a review.\u201d  ('794 patent , \ncol. 2:31-42)  Moreover, as Plaintiff notes in its briefing, (D.I. 55 at 15), the specification also \nincludes the following language:  \u201cT he SMS can be easily opened and links embedded  in the \nSMS clicked on, causing the platform to automatically redirect a mobile device to a business\u2019s profile on a review sites/app or website, thereby reducing the effort and friction in driving users to the business\u2019s profiles on review site to leave reviews .\u201d  ('794 patent, col. 6:49-54 (emphasis \nadded) )  Reading that text, it seems possible that if claim 19 actually required only the use of \nSMS -based messages with associated links  as part of the review direction process, then perhaps 15 \n that (more specific) real -world application\u2014one that has something to do with how computers \nwork \u2014might impact the Section 101 analysis here.   \nBut claims claim.  And claim 19 is not limited to the use of SMS messages, nor to using \nlinks in an SMS message to redirect the user to a review website.  The claim\u2019s text does not \nmake reference to SMS messages explicitly .  Nor does it directly reference  such links.  Instead, \nthe claim facially require s only tha t the method \u201ctransmit[]\u201d an unspecified type of \u201cmessage\u201d \nsoliciting a review and then later  \u201cdirect[] a device associated with the potential reviewer to [the \ndynamically -determined] profile page of the entity on the review website\u201d in some unspecified  \nway.  Moreover, if the claim was even arguably limited in these ways, Plaintiff had ample \nopportunity to tell the Court this .  It could have said so in its answering brief, or argued this \nduring the hearing.  It could have proposed a construction for the \u201ctransmitting\u201d or \u201cdirecting\u201d \nclaim steps to this effect.  But it did not.   \nThus, the Court cannot conclude that claim 19 is directed to an \u201cSMS -message- based \u201d \nrequest  that a review be written, or to a \u201c frictionless \u201d way of directing users to review websites \nvia links sent in SMS messages.  Instead, it appears that the claim is simply directed to the high -\nlevel abstract idea proffered b y Defendant .    \n Thus, t he Court moves to step two of the analysis.    \n2. Alice \u2019s Step Two  \nAt step two, as it did with the '296 patent, Plaintiff unfortunately makes little attempt to \nspecify what actually is the purported inventive concept  in claim 19 .  (D.I. 55 at 17- 18)  For \nexample, in the step two section of its answering brief  as to this patent , Plaintiff simply states  \nthat:  \u201c[T]he claims are directed to solving problems related to challenges associated with \ngathering reviews from potential reviewers in order to present those reviews on an online 16 \n platform, all toward supporting an accurate and useful assessment of a business\u2019 s online \nreputation.\u201d   (Id.)  That is the language of abstraction, not the language of concrete, real -world \napplication.   \nNow, in this section of its brief , Plaintiff does again reference th e patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory in order to suggest  the presence of  a relevant fact dispute.  (D.I. 55 at 18)   During \nprosecution, the patentee  (citing to a n above -refer enced portion of the specification)  argued that \nthe claims were not invalid under Section 101 because \u201cthe elements recite a specific \nimprovement over prior art systems by \u2018reducing the effort and friction in driving users to the business\u2019s profiles on review sites to leave reviews[.]\u2019\u201d  ( D.I. 55, ex. C at 9; D.I. 33 at \u00b6 50)  In \nresponse to this , the Examiner concluded that \u201cthe independent claims are . . . \u2018significantly \nmore \u2019 than an abstract idea\u201d and that they \u201cinclude specific limitations for facilitating user \nreviews that are not well -understood, routine, nor conventional in the field; are integrated into a \npractical application; and/or add unconventional steps that confine the claim to a particular \nuseful application.\u201d  (D.I. 33 at \u00b6 50; D.I. 55, ex. D at \u00b6 8)  However, in the prosecut ion history \nthe patentee never specified what specific elements of the claims  were said to \u201creduc[e] the effort \nand friction\u201d as to the process of getting users to leave reviews on a review web site.  And just as \nwith the '296 patent, the Examiner was also very unspecific about what about the independent \nclaims at issue rendered them \u201csignificantly more \u201d than an  abstract idea.  The fact that the \npatentee or the Examiner simply stated a conclusion about eligibility during prosecution does not highlight a material dispute of fact  on the Section 101 question.  And s o the prosecution history \nportion of the record is not helpful to Plaintiff at step two.  \nThis leaves th e element of claim 19 that requires \u201c dynamically determin ing, using one  or \nmore processors, and from a plurality of review websites, a review website on which the 17 \n potential reviewer should be directed to write the review for the entity[.]\u201d  ('794 patent, col. 41: 9-\n12 (emphasis added) )  This element was only briefly referenced  in Plaintiff\u2019s answering brief .  \n(D.I. 55 at 16, 17)   But at the hearing, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel spent a lot of time discussing it.  (Tr. at \n271-75)   \nDoes the \u201cdynamically determining\u201d element amount \u201csignificantly more\u201d than the \nabstract idea itself ?  If it was arguable that th is claim term required something particular \nregarding the  process of dynamic determination \u2014i.e., something that  could amount to the \nunconventional use of computers in order to solve a technological problem  (like a particular \nalgorithm that set out how this website selection process gets determined )\u2014than perhaps denial \nof the Motion would be appropriate as to this patent.  But during the hearing, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel \nconfirmed that this was not so.  When asked what \u201cdynamically det ermining\u201d means, counsel \nsimply offered the following construction:  \u201chaving the system determine based on the input where the user should be directed.\u201d  (Tr. at 274)  The Court agrees with Defendant that , even \nwere it to adopt th is claim construction for the term, th e claim element would offer no \u201cconcrete \nlimitations [that speak to a claim] directed to a specific technological improvement.\u201d   (Id. at 253)  \nThe claim would simply require th at the  method select a review website using any methodology \n(or no methodology)  at all.  Put differently, t he element would add nothing to the claim that \namounts to an improvement in the way that computers work.  Cf. In re Greenstein , 778 F. App\u2019x \n935, 939 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (concluding that a patent\u2019s claims, which were di rected to the abstract \nidea of providing recommendations for the purchase or lease of good or services, did not contain an inventive concept at step two\u2014despite the presence of a claim step that required insuring that the recommendation was an independent one \u2014as \u201cthere is no suggestion that the \u2018insuring\u2019 step \nrequires anything more than conventional data processing performed by a generic computer\u201d and 18 \n thus \u201cthe claims are broadly directed to [the abstract idea] without offering a technical solution to \nhow one would \u2018insure\u2019 that the data relied on originates from a person who is independent of the transaction\u201d) . \nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that claim 19 does not include an inventive \nconcept.  And so it recommends that the Motion be granted as to the asserted claims of the '794 patent.   \nC. The '966 Patent  \nThe ' 966 patent is entitled \u201c Reputation Report with Score .\u201d  ('966 patent  at 1)  G enerally \nspeaking, it relates to performing an online reputation analysis  of an individual  and generating a \nscore based on the analysis .  (Tr. at 256)   The Court will assess the eligibility of claim 1 8, which \nit finds to be representative.\n11  Claims 18 recites the following: \n18.  A method, comprising:  \n \nperforming an automated preliminary coding of a document, wherein the automated preliminary coding of the document is based at least in part on at least one of an amount of time that the document has been available online and a domain from which the document was retrieved ; \n performing, using one or more processors, an assessment of an online reputation of an individual, wherein the assessment pertains to a particular aspect of the individual\u2019s online reputation, and wherein the assessment is performed based at least in part on the \nautomated preliminary coding of the document ; \n based at least in part on the performed online reputation assessment, generating a reputation score pertaining to the particular aspect of the individual\u2019s online reputation; and  \n provi ding the reputation score as an output . \n \n \n11  Defendant asserts that claim 18 is representative.  (Defendant\u2019s Hearing \nPresentation, Slide 2)   In its briefing, Plaintiff d oes not contest that assertion.  (D.I. 55 at 18- 22)   19 \n ('966 patent , col. 11:35- 52) \n1. Alice \u2019s Step One  \nDefendant argues that claim 18 is directed to the abstract idea of \u201cassessing an \nindividual\u2019s reputation based on documents about the individual to generate a reputation score. \u201d  \n(D.I. 45 at 15; Defendant\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 65)  It asserts that this claim covers a \nmethod that  is similar to \u201c[a person] getting a credit score where you are taking a document, you \nare assessing  a person\u2019s reputation, and you are generating ultimately a score ,\u201d (Tr. at 256) , and \nthat \u201cthe steps of the claim are analogous to determining an individual\u2019s credit score[ ,]\u201d (D.I. 45 \nat 16) .  More s pecifically, Defendant argues that , \u201c[a]side from conventional computer concepts , \na credit -reporting agency could practice claim 18 by\u201d:  (1)  \u201creviewing a financial document and \ncategorizing the document as being relatively more or less impactful to an individual\u2019s credit scored based on how old the document is or the source of the document\u201d ; (2) \u201cassess [ing] the \nindividual\u2019s financial reputation based at least in part o n the categorization of [that]  financial \ndocument\u201d ; and (3) then, \u201c [b]ased on the assessment of the individual\u2019s financial reputation, the \ncredit -reporting agency could generate a credit score for the individual.\u201d  (Id.); see also  \nMortgage Grader, Inc. v. First Choice Loan Servs. Inc ., 811 F.3d 1314, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2016) \n(concluding at step one that claim s were directed to \u201canonymous loan shopping[,]\u201d where the \nsteps covered by the claims (\u201cborrower applies for a loan, a third party calculates the borrower\u2019s credit grading, lenders provide loan pricing information to the third party based on the borrower\u2019s credit grading, and . . . the borrower discloses its identity t o a lender \u201d) all \u201ccould be \nperformed by humans without a computer\u201d).   \nAgain here, Plaintiff does not dispute that \u201cassessing an individual\u2019s reputation based on \ndocuments about the individual to generate a reputation score\u201d is an abstract idea.  Instead i t 20 \n argues that claim 18 is not directed to that idea, but rather \u201caddresses a challenge particular to the \nInternet, namely online reviews and reputation management\u201d and constitutes an \u201cimprove[ment]\u201d to \u201cthose systems by solving a problem inherent to them.\u201d   (D.I. 55 at 19)   \nIn assessing th e step one question, the Court again starts with the claim language.  In that \nregard, it is surely true that some of t hat language overlaps with the abstract idea at issue.  For \nexample, the claim certainly is about a method meant to perform an \u201cassessment of an online reputation of an individual[.]\u201d  ( '966 patent, col. 11:42- 43)  The method does rely on \n\u201cdocument[s]\u201d to do so.  ( Id., col. 11:36- 41)  And the method does ultima tely \u201cgenerat[e] a \nreputation score\u201d based on the document (s).  (Id., col. 11:49)  Th at said, there is also more to the \nclaim, as it requires :  (1) that an \u201c automated preliminary coding\u201d of a document be performed; \n(2) th at this coding be \u201cbased at least i n part on at least one of an amount of time that the \ndocument has been available online and a domain from which the document was retrieved\u201d; and (3) that the reputation score in turn be based at least in part on \u201can assessment of an online \nreputation of an individual\u201d that is \u201cperformed based in part on the automated preliminary coding of the document[.]\u201d  ( Id., col. 11: 35-52)   \nBut are these other portions of the claim central to what the claim is directed to , or do \nthey otherwise save the claim at step one ?  It does not seem so.   \nThat claim 18 is directed to the asserted abstract idea can in part be understood by \nlooking at the rest of the patent.  The patent \u2019s title ( \u201cReputation Report with Score\u201d ) suggests a \nfocus simply on the provision of a reputation score itself.   ('966 patent  at 1)  In the specification\u2019s \n\u201cBackground of the Invention\u201d s ection , when it comes to setting out the challenge that th e patent \nintends to address, the patent notes : \nIncreasingly, when a first person chooses to learn more about a \nsecond person, the first person will perform an online search with 21 \n respect to the second person.  Unfortunately, the search results may \nbe inaccurate or provide an incomplete picture of the second \nperson. The first person may make important and potentially erroneous decisions about the second person based on the search results.  \n \n('966 patent , col. 1:13- 19)  Th is indicates that the patent is  concerned  with weeding out \npotentially inaccurate or incomplete  information that might make it difficult to assess a person\u2019s \n\u201ctrue\u201d reputation.  But the specification (both in this passage and otherwise) never seems to \nexplain how the patent\u2019s solution to that problem is a technological solution.  (D.I. 45 at 18 \n(Defendant noting that the patent does not recite \u201ca technological solution to a technological \nproblem\u201d))  Instead, it seems like the focus of the patent i s at a much  higher  level \u2014one that \nseems to mesh with the abstract idea at issue (\u201cassessing an individual\u2019s reputation based on documents about the individual to generate a reputation score\u201d).  \nIn its briefing, when Plaintiff attempted  to explain what the claim actually is directed to, \nit repeatedly emphasized \u2014over and over  and over again \u2014that the  claim was meant to provide  \nbusinesses with \u201cthe objective , accurate assessment they need []\u201d by \u201c objectively  coding\u201d Internet \nreviews or by \u201ccalculating an objective reputation score.\u201d  (D.I. 55 at 19 (emphasis added) ; see \nalso id. at 20 (asserting that the patent claims \u201cthe generation of an objective  score\u201d and \u201capplies \nan objective evaluation\u201d)  (emphasis adde d); id. at 21 (\u201ccl aim 18 automates a process in an \nobjective fashion according to previously unused objective criteria\u201d) (emphasis added) ; D.I. 33 at \n\u00b6 60 (\u201cThe '966 P atent \u2019s inventions automate a process in an objective  fashion, including by \nincluding coding according to objective criteria previously unused.\u201d) (emphasis added);  Tr. at \n280; D.I. 57 at 10)  During the hearing on the Motion, the Court followed up on these assertions .  \nIn part, the Court did so because even though claim 18 requir es an \u201cautomated preliminary \ncoding\u201d of a document relating to a person\u2019s reputation, it seemed at least possible that this 22 \n coding process i nvolves a level of s ubjectivity somewhere along the way.  The word \n\u201cobjective[,]\u201d  after all,  is not in the claim or the specification.  (Tr. at 280 (Plaintiff\u2019s counsel \nconceding that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the claim or the specification that says objective\u201d) ; see also  \nid. at 259- 60)  Indeed, one  of the two listed bases in the claim as to  how a document can be \ncoded relates to the \u201cdomain from which the document was retrieved [.]\u201d  ('966 patent, col . 11:40-\n41)  I t would seem that whether such a  domain is preliminarily coded in a positive or negative \nlight could, at some point in that  coding process, depend on a person\u2019s subjective view about \nwhether the website was in fact \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative.\u201d  ( '966 patent, col s. 3:51- 4:11 \n(explaining that in certain embodiments, a \u201cclassifier  214\u201d and a human work together to \npreliminarily code a domain as being a \u201c\u2018positi ve\u2019\u201d or \u201c\u2018negative\u2019\u201d domain,  and that a charitable \norganization\u2019s web page might be deemed a \u201cpositive\u201d  domain) ; see also  D.I. 57 at 10)   Yet i n \nthe end, when the Court questioned Plaintiff\u2019s counsel about this issue at  the hearing, counsel \nended up stating that \u201cobjective criteria\u201d had nothing to do with why the claim was patentable.  \n(Tr. at 283- 86)12     \nWith that issue stripped away, what it seems Plaintiff was really arguing i s that the claim \nis patent eligible at s tep one because it performs \u201can automatic  preliminary coding\u201d \u2014i.e., a \n \n12  The Court does not agree with Plaintiff\u2019s related assertion that the claim here is  \nsimilar to those at issue in McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299 (Fed. \nCir. 2016).  (D.I. 55 at 20; Tr. at 285- 86)  In McRO , the Federal Circuit found that the \nrepresentative claim at issue was not directed to the abstract idea of \u201cautomated rules -based use \nof morph targets and delta sets for lip- synchronized three -dime nsional animation.\u201d  837 F.3d at \n1313 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  That was because the claimed process used \u201ca combined order of specific rules  that renders information into a specific format that is then \nused and applied to created desired results:  a sequence of synchronized, animated characters\u201d\u2014rules that were different that what animators were using at the time of the patent for computer automation.  Id . at 1315 (emphasis added) ; see also Ficep Corp., 2021 WL 254104, at *3 & n.2.  \nHere, Plaintiff never explains what the analogous computerized \u201cspecific rules\u201d or processes are in claim 18 that would mirror the rules at issue in McRO , or why those were different than what \nwere used to generate a reputation score in the non- computer c ontext. 23 \n process that happens automatically, thanks to the use of a computer.  (D.I. 55 at 20 (emphasis \nadded); see also  D.I. 33 at \u00b6 60 (\u201cThe '966 P atent \u2019s inventions automate  a process in an objective \nfashion . . . .\u201d)  (emphasis added) ; '966 patent, col . 3:51- 4:11 (describing the coding process \nbeneficial because certain results or classifiers can be coded \u201cautomatically\u201d) )  But the fact that a \ncomputer can  perform an abstract  idea more quickly and efficiently ( i.e., \u201cautomatically\u201d) than a \nhuman could cannot be a reason as to why a claim is directed to a patent eligible  concept .  See  \nFicep Corp., 2021 WL 254104, at *3 (\u201c[I]f a claim simply takes an abstract idea (say, somethin g \nthat humans have done for a long time) and does nothing more than make use of a generic computer to perform the abstract idea faster or more accurately than a human could (the type of \u2018conventional\u2019 function that any computer can make happen), then the c laim is ineligible .\u201d) \n(citing cases) ; see also supra Section III. C.2.   \n For the foregoing reasons, Defendant has demonstrated that the representative claim  is \ndirected simply to the abstract idea at issue.  \n2. Alice \u2019s Step Two  \nAt step two, Plaintiff\u2019s argument for dismissal of the Motion revolves entirely around the \nprosecution history.  (D.I. 55 at 21- 22)  The FAC notes that during prosecution, the Examiner \nrejected the claims pursuant to Section 101 , but then advised the patentee that : \n\u201cThe Examiner believes  the 101 rejection can be overcome if the \nindependent claims are amended to include an automated element \nfor preliminary coding of a document as disclosed in the specification (Para 0021); wherein the  document is coded based on \nautomated  analysis other than simply manually defining/coding \nsearch result data by a user \u2013 Specification Para (0020 -0026).\u201d  \n \n(D.I. 33 at \u00b6  60; see also  D.I. 55, ex. E at 5 -6 at \u00b6 9)  Plaintiff further pleads that: \n \nThe applicant subsequently included such an amendment, which \nappears in the claims as issued.  . . .  The Examiner, after \nconcluding that the claims of the \u2019966 Patent are patent eligible  24 \n under \u00a7 101, stated that \u201cthe independent claims are considered by \nthe Examiner to be  \u2018significantly more\u2019 than a n abstract idea. \nIndependent claims 1, 16, and 20 include specific  limitations for \nperforming a reputation analysis and generating a reputation report that are not well  understood, routine, nor conventional in the field; \nand/or adding unconventional steps that confine  the claim to a \nparticular useful application.\u201d  \n \n(D.I. 33 at \u00b6\u00b6  60-61; see also  D.I. 55, ex. F at 3 at \u00b6 5)    \nHowever, the Court cannot see  why ( and Plaintiff does not ever explain why ) adding the \nword \u201cautomated\u201d to claim 18 would save an otherwise patent ineligible claim.   As the Court \nnoted above, simply automating the performance of an abstract idea by way of the use of a \ncomputer adds nothing to the eligibility calculus.  See Alice , 573 U.S. at 225 (issuing \u201cautomated \ninstructions \u201d is a well -understood, routine activity performed by a computer and cannot amount \nto an inventive concept);  Credit Acceptance Corp. v. Westlake Servs ., 859 F.3d 1044, 1055 (Fed. \nCir. 2017) (\u201cOur prior cases have made clear that mere automation of manual process es using \ngeneric computers does not constitute a patentable improvement in computer technology.\u201d);  OIP \nTechs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc ., 788 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2015)  (\u201cBut relying on a \ncomputer to perform routine tasks more quickly or more accurately is insufficient to render a claim patent eligible.\u201d); see also  Ficep Corp., 2021 WL 254104, at *3.  It cannot amount to the \nasserted inventive concept.  (D.I. 57 at 11; Defendant\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 81)  \nThe Court cannot otherwise identify an inventive concept in claim 18, and thus it \nconcludes that the claim also fails step two.  As a result, the Court recommends that the Motion be granted as to the '966 patent . \nD. The '312 Patent  \nThe ' 312 patent is entitled  \u201cAssigning Sentiment to Themes .\u201d  ('312 patent at 1)  \nGenerally speaking, it relates to the identification and then subsequent categorization of themes 25 \n from a business\u2019 online reviews .  (Id. at Abstract (\u201cAssigning sentiment to themes is disclosed. . . \n. For a first review included in the reputation data [which includes user -authored reviews that are \nextracted from a data source], at least one keyword is determined using the first review\u2019s text.  A \nsentiment is assigned for a theme associated with the keyword based at least in part on the first \nreview\u2019s rating.\u201d))  The  Court will assess the eligibility of claim 1 6, as it finds it to be \nrepresentative.13  Claim 16 recites the following:  \n16.  A method, compr ising:  \n \nreceiv ing reputation data extracted from at least one data source, \nwherein the reputation data includes user -authored reviews \npertaining to an entity and wherein a review comprises text and an accompanying rating;  \n for a first review included in th e reputation data, identifying a \ntheme in the first review that is associated with an aspect of the entity at least in part by determining, using a processor, at least one keyword using the first review\u2019s text ; \n assigning a first sentiment for the identified theme at least in part by using the first review\u2019s accompanying rating;  \n assigning a sentiment for a parent them[e] of the identified theme at least in part by using the first review\u2019s accompanying rating;  \n for a second review included in the reputation data that includes the determined at least one keyword and in which the theme is \nidentified, assigning a second sentiment for the identified theme based at least in part o n the second review\u2019s accompanying rat ing; \nand \n providing as output a report that includes the identified theme, a combination of the respective first and second sentiments for that identified theme, the parent theme, and the sentiment for that parent theme.  \n \n('312 patent , cols. 33:32- 34:14) \n \n13  Defendant asserts that claim 16 is representative, (Defendant\u2019s Hearing \nPresentation, Slide 2), and Plaintiff does  not dispute that in its briefing, (D.I. 55 at 22- 25).   26 \n 1. Alice \u2019s Step One  \nDefendant argues that claim 16 is directed to the abstract idea of \u201cidentifying themes in a \nbusiness\u2019s reviews and assigning \u2018sentiments\u2019 (e.g. positive, negative, or neutral) to the themes \nbased on review ratings (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) .\u201d  (D.I. 45 at 20; Tr. at 262; Defendant\u2019s Hearing \nPresentation, Slide 87)  Defendant argues that this idea can  be, and is , easily practiced outside of \nthe computer context, such as where a market research company performs a survey campaign by similarly :  (1) gathering user -authored reviews; (2) identifying keywords and related themes in \nthose reviews; (3) assigning sentiment s (i.e., \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d) to the themes based on \nhow many stars the reviewer gave the business; and (4) drafting and providing a report  that lists \nidentified themes /parent themes  and averag es the ratings for those  theme s, in order  to provide an \naverage overall sentiment associated with the themes.  (D.I. 45 at 20- 21; see also  Tr. at 264- 65)   \nPlaintiff does not dispute that \u201cidentifying themes in a business\u2019s reviews and assigning \n\u2018sentiments\u2019 (e.g. positive, negative, or neutral) to the themes base d on review ratings (e.g., 1 to \n5 stars)\u201d is an abstract idea.  But it  argues that claim 16 is not directed to  that idea.  Instead, \nPlaintiff asserts that the claim is directed to a  technological solution to technological problem .  In \nexplaining why this i s so, Plaintiff states  that:  (1) at the time of the patent, a business faced the \nproblem that there might be thousands or tens of thousands of online reviews about th at business, \nand any of these reviews could have an impact on a potential customer\u2019s view of the  business ; \n(2) conventional online review systems  lacked the \u201cability for business [es] to objectively monitor \ntheir reputations across all platforms \u201d; and (3) the  way the  patent attempts  to solve this problem \nis that it \u201c automates  an objective process that receives extracted reputation data[,] identifies a \ntheme based on one or more keywords[] and assigns sentiments, in order to provide an output report.\u201d  ( D.I. 55 at 22 (emphasis added) (citing D.I. 33 at \u00b6\u00b6 62 -64); see also  D.I. 33 a t \u00b6 64 27 \n (\u201c[T]he '312 patent  automates  an objective  process that receives extracted reputation data . . .\u201d ) \n(emphasis added))  \nIn light of the Court\u2019s comments above with regard to the '966 patent , one can quickly \nsee why Plaintiff\u2019s approach here is problematic.    \nFor one thing, claim 16 does not facially include a requirement that the identification of a \ntheme or the assigning of a sentiment must be an entirely \u201cobjective\u201d process.  (D.I. 57 at 12)  \nIndeed, the word \u201cobjective\u201d is nowhere to be found in the patent, and at times, the patent describes how , in certain embodiments of the invention, users of a system can (subjectively) \ncustomize the keywords and themes that are u tilized.  ( Id.; see also  '312 patent , col. 27:52- 53)  In \nits briefing, Plaintiff never asserts that claim construction is needed as to a ny term in claim 16, \nnor that any such term sh ould have an \u201cobjective\u201d requirement built into its construction. \nAdditionally, for the reasons previously noted above  as to the '966 patent , it is of no \nmoment in the Section 101 analysis that the patent \u201cautomates\u201d the process of assigning \nsentiments to themes and then generat es a report.  It may well be, as the FAC alleges, that in \nlight of the \u201cenormous amount of information available on di verse and incongruous online \nsources [,]\u201d manual ly attempting this type of assignment  process was \u201cnot viable\u201d\u2014and that  \nautomation of that process was thus very helpful.  (D.I. 33 at \u00b6 67)  But again, the fact that a claim uses a computer to automate the performance of an abstract idea\u2014making the process go faster or more efficiently tha n it could if a human were performing it \u2014is not enough to make a \ndifference at Alice \u2019s step one. \nBeyond that, claim 16\u2019s language largely tracks the asserted abstract idea at issue.  \nAdditionally,  if one sets aside the claim\u2019s reference to a generic computer \u201cprocessor,\u201d the \nmethod at issue \u201ccan be performed entirely in the human mind[.]\u201d   CyberSource Corp. v. Retail 28 \n Decisions, Inc ., 654 F.3d 1366, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ; see also  Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. \nSymantec Corp., 838 F.3d 1307, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2016) .  This is also a sign that the patent is \ndirected to an abstract idea, since \u201ccomputational methods which can be performed  entirely in \nthe human mind are the types of methods that embody the \u2018basic tools of scientific and \ntechnological work\u2019 that are free to all men and reserved exclusively to no one.\u201d  CyberSource Corp., 654 F.3d at 1373 (citation omitted).   And as Defendant  notes, (D.I. 45 at 21- 22), it is also \ncorrect to say that the claim\u2019s focus is on \u201ccollecting information, analyzing it, and displaying certain results of the collection and analysis[,]\u201d which is a patent -ineligible concept.  Electric \nPower Grp., 830 F.3d at  1353- 54.\n14 \nThe Court thus finds that claim 16  is directed to an abstract idea.  It therefore moves on to \nstep two. \n2. Alice \u2019s Step Two  \nIn the portion of its answering brief relating to step two for this patent, Plaintiff argues \nthat there are \u201cunderlying fact questions\u201d that exist as to whether the claim contains an inventive concept.  (D.I. 55 at 24)  But Plaintiff never identifies what those \u201cfact questions\u201d are.  Instead, it simply  notes  that \u201c the Examiner concluded that the '312 patent  satisfies [Section] 101.\u201d  ( Id.; see \n \n14  At the very end of the step one section regarding this patent in its answering brief, \nPlaintiff briefly suggested that claim 16 passes muster  because it requires assigning sentiments to \nparent themes \u201cthat inherently requires performance of a complex numerical process  to identify \nsuch parent -child relationship among themes.\u201d  (D.I. 55 at 24 (emphasis added) )  But as \nDefendant notes, (D.I. 57 at 12), Plaintiff said nothing about:  (1) why the language of any \nparticular claim term might require such a \u201ccomplex numerical process\u201d; (2) what a claim construction for such a term might look like in that regard; and (3) what portion of the record supports such a n assertion.  If a n accused infringer makes an apparently well -founded allegation \nof patent ineligibility in a motion to dismiss, a patentee cannot avoid dismissal by simply putting forward a one -line argument in its briefing and then refusin g to provide any supporting details as \nto why  that argument is a valid one.  Thus, this aspect of Plaintiff\u2019s answering brief does not save \nthe claim at step one.  29 \n also D.I. 33 at \u00b6 70; D.I. 55, ex. G)   But the referenced prosecution history contains no \ninformation regarding why  the Examiner thought claim 16 was patent -eligible .  (D.I. 33 at \u00b6 70; \nD.I. 55, ex. G)  And for reasons the Court has already expressed, the Examiner\u2019s  bare  legal  \nconclusion about eligibility  does not bind the Court , nor is it sufficient (without more) to \ndemonstrate the existence of a material fact dispute a t step two.  \nThe Court cannot otherwise identify an inventive concept in claim 16, and thus it \nconcludes that the claim fails step two.  As a result, the Court recommends tha t the Motion be \ngranted as to the '312 patent . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that Defendant\u2019s Motion be \nGRANTED.   \nIn its briefing, Plaintiff sought leave to amend the FAC in order to further address Section \n101 issues, wer e the Court to conclude that some or all of the patents -in-suit were patent \nineligible.  (D.I. 55 at 25)  It is not clear to the Court, based on the current record, that  Plaintiff \ncould further amend the FAC in a manner that would clear the pleading bar as  to one or more of \nthese patents.  ( See D.I. 45 at 25)  But as a practical matter, the Court\u2019s decision herein will \nlikely draw objections from Plaintiff.  And as part of the objections process, if Plaintiff thinks that amendment would be a non- futile act,  it can attempt to make th e case as to why th is is so \ndirectly to the District Judge .   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
