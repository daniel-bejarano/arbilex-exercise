BRATHWAITE, \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nWARDEN PERRY PHELPS, et al., \n \nDefendants .  No. 10-cv-646-SB \n \nTimothy Devlin, Andrew DeMarco, James Lennon & Veronica Shad, D EVLIN LAW \nFIRM LLC, Wilmington, Delaware  \nCounsel for Plaintiff  \n \nNicholas Picollelli, Jr., D ELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, Wilmington, \nDelaware \n \nCounsel for Defendants  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nMarch 30, 2022 \nBIBAS, Circuit Judge , sitting by designation. \nProcess must precede punishment. Kevin Brathwaite has raised a genuine dispute \nabout whether he got the process he was due before he was kept in solitary \nconfinement year after year. And defendants\u2019 obligation to give him that process was \nclearly established. So I grant his summary-judgment motion in part.  \n2 I. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual background \nUnless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed. \n1. Brathwaite\u2019s transfer to solitary confinement.  Brathwaite is serving six \nconsecutive life sentences plus 110 years in prison. D.I. 273-3, at 27; State v. \nBrathwaite , 2003 WL 1410155, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 17, 2003). In 1998, he was \nconvicted of (among other offenses) sixteen counts of sex crimes after assaulting three \ndifferent women. Brathwaite v. Phelps , 2009 WL 3345595, at *1 (D. Del. Oct. 16, \n2009). At first, he was part of the general prison population. D.I. 273-2, at 14. But \nafter marijuana was found in his cell in 2004, he was transferred to the secure-\nhousing unit\u2014maximum-security solitary confinement. Id. at 26. (Technically, not \neveryone in secure housing was in solitary. See D.I. 273-9, at 15:11\u201322. But \nBrathwaite was. So I refer to them interchangeably.)  \nThe marijuana was neither Brathwaite\u2019s first nor last problem. In prison-speak, \ndefendants say he suffered from \u201c[p]oor institutional adjustment.\u201d See, e.g., D.I. 273-\n3, at 16. Before his transfer to solitary, he had also been booked for bribery and \n\u201cfailure to obey.\u201d See id. at 46; D.I. 273-2, at 28\u201329. After his transfer, he became \n\u201cvery dangerous.\u201d D.I. 273-6, at 96. According to defendants, he threw his urine and \nfeces at staff, smeared his feces on his cell\u2019s walls, refused to shower, once assaulted \nstaff with a homemade weapon, and more. Id. at 96, 114, 126\u201327. Naturally, they \nconsidered him a safety risk and kept him in solitary. Id. at 45\u201346. \n2. Brathwaite\u2019s conditions in solitary.  While in solitary, Brathwaite had almost no \nhuman contact. He did not have a cellmate. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 2. He ate meals alone in his  \n3 cell. Id. \u00b6 9. Defendants say he might have spoken with other prisoners through the \nvents or during recreation, but Brathwaite denies having any contact with other \nprisoners. Compare D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 4, with D.I. 273-2, at 18:6\u20139. He was allowed one \nfifteen-minute phone call per week, legal or otherwise. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 7. He could host \ntwo or three visits per month, but all were noncontact. Id. \u00b6 6; D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 6. \n\u201cNoncontact\u201d means that Brathwaite and his visitor were separated by a glass wall \nand spoke through a phone. D.I. 273-13, at 39:20\u201324; D.I. 273-7, at 17:9\u201321. \nBrathwaite did have some contact with prison officials. He talked to guards when \nthey walked by his cell. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 5; D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 5. And every ninety days, he spoke \nwith a counselor about his quality-of-life level. D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 5. Within the secure-\nhousing unit, there were multiple quality-of-life levels, with varying privileges. D.I. \n273-13, at 42:8\u201323. Brathwaite was at the highest quality-of-life level. D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 6; \nD.I. 273-2, at 16:2\u201323. So along with the telephone and visitation privileges described \nabove, he got $45 in commissary credit every two weeks, a radio and television, access \nto some educational programs, and access to the law (but not general) library. \nD.I. 273-2, at 17:2\u20136, 21:21\u201324:10. \nDespite his high quality-of-life level, his freedom of movement was still \nconstrained. For forty-five minutes every other day, he was allowed out of his cell for \nrecreation. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 3. Recreation took place both inside and outside, but just in \nempty cages set up for the purpose. D.I. 273-2, at 19:1\u201312. He could also take five \nfifteen-minute showers per week. D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 3. Whenever he left his cell, he was \nhandcuffed. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 3.   \n4 3. Brathwaite\u2019s duration in solitary.  By the time he filed this lawsuit in 2010, \nBrathwaite had been in solitary for nearly six and a half years. D.I. 273-2, at 14; \nD.I. 278-1 \u00b6 1 (transferred to solitary Feb. 19, 2004); Compl. D.I. 2 (complaint filed \nAug. 2, 2010). His stay was continuous apart from a few brief interruptions: For three \ndays in late 2004, he was downgraded to the medium-high-security housing unit, one \nstep below secure housing. D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 1. But he \u201cexpressed his contempt at the con-\nditions \u2026 and made threats that he was going to do certain things,\u201d so he was trans-\nferred back to solitary. D.I. 273-6, at 101:11\u201312. After that, he spent two periods in \nthe prison infirmary in late 2004 and early 2005, totaling about three months. D.I. 278-\n1 \u00b6 1. After February 24, 2005, his stay in the secure-housing unit was unbroken. Id.  \nHis multiyear solitary confinement was, to say the least, unusual. One defendant \ntestified that a \u201creasonable time frame\u201d in solitary was \u201ca matter of months.\u201d D.I. 273-\n6, at 42:14\u201317. Though an extended stay was not unheard of, another defendant tes-\ntified that a period of several years was \u201cuncommon\u201d and \u201crare.\u201d D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 28. \n4. Review of Brathwaite\u2019s secure-housing classification.  Brathwaite\u2019s secure-\nhousing classification was reviewed annually. See generally  D.I. 273-3. See also  \nD.I. 277, at 13; D.I. 273-8, at 23. These reviews had two parts. First, a two-person \nmultidisciplinary team (consisting of a counselor and a guard) would recommend a \nclassification. D.I. 273-8, at 16\u201317. Then, that team\u2019s decision would be reviewed by \nthe prison\u2019s four-person classification committee. Id. at 17\u201318. According to prison \npolicy, \u201c[e]ach offender\u201d whose classification was under review \u201cshall be interviewed\u201d \nand \u201cmust be present and \u2026 encouraged to participate.\u201d Id. at 16, 21; D.I. 273-1  \n5 \u00b6\u00b6 10\u201311, D.I. 278-1 \u00b6\u00b6 10\u201311. The policy also required that the prisoner receive the \nfinal decision in person or in writing. D.I. 273-8, at 18, 21. No matter what the com-\nmittees decided, Delaware law gave the warden a veto. Id. at 21. \nThese reviews used a risk-assessment score. To find that score, a prison official \nwould fill out a form. The form assigned points for the severity of the offense of incar-\nceration, escape and misconduct history, age, and so on. See, e.g., D.I. 273-3, at 20\u2013\n21. The official would then tally up the score and match it to the risk-assessment \nscale. If a prisoner had a score from zero to eight, the default recommendation was \nminimum security; if nine to sixteen, medium security; if seventeen and up, maximum \nsecurity. Id. But officials had discretion to override these defaults. Id. \nAt several classification reviews, Brathwaite\u2019s risk-assessment score was low \nenough to qualify him for a security downgrade. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 14; D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 14. But \nsomeone always overrode that score. Id.; see also D.I. 273-3, at 2, 5, 10, 13\u201314, 18, 21, \n26, 34, 37. In 2009, his risk-assessment score qualified him for minimum security. \nD.I. 278-1 \u00b6 14. But the classification committee kept him in maximum security and \ngave this explanation: \u201cBrathwaite has a long history of not following the institution[\u2019]s \nrules. He continues to receive minor write-ups. [He] is on the Remain in SHU list and \nhas been for some time. His behavior shows that he is still not ready to come off this \nlist.\u201d D.I. 273-3, at 4. His 2007 and 2008 reviews were much the same story. Though \nhe qualified for medium security, he was kept in the secure-housing unit because of his \n2004 staff assault and because he was on the remain-in-SHU list. Id. at 10\u201311, 13\u201314.  \n6 This remain-in-SHU list is a point of contention. According to Brathwaite, the list \nguaranteed that he would be kept in the secure-housing unit, rendering the commit-\ntees\u2019 reviews meaningless. Plus, he says it was impossible to get off the list. Defend-\nants counter that the list was merely a consolidated place to keep track of trouble-\nsome prisoners. They say the list kept safety risks from slipping through the cracks, \nespecially when staff turned over. See D.I. 278-1 \u00b6\u00b6 15\u201322. They admit that there was \nno official process for getting off the list, and one defendant testified that she had \nnever known a prisoner to be removed from it. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25. No one knows \nexactly when the list was created, or when Brathwaite was added to it. But \nBrathwaite\u2019s 2007, 2008, and 2009 review forms all mentioned the list to justify his \ncontinued solitary confinement. See D.I. 273-3, at 4, 10, 14. \nAs for the reviews themselves, Brathwaite testified that (before suing) he was \nnever present for them. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 12; D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 12. He also testified that, at least \nseveral times, he did not see the committees\u2019 written decisions. D.I. 273-2, at 34:16\u2013\n22, 36:4\u201310, 59:10\u201360:12, 67:2\u201324, 76:4\u201322, 79:3\u201381:8. Over the years, he wrote many \nletters to the warden to get \u201ctaken off that remain-in-SHU list\u201d and \u201cget scheduled \nfor reclassification.\u201d Id. at 38, 67\u201368, 100:14\u201318. Brathwaite testified that he never \ngot a response. Id. at 37:7, 100:19\u201321. \n5. This suit.  So he sued. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Brathwaite seeks damages, claim-\ning that prison officials violated his Fourteenth Amendment due-process rights. See \nD.I. 2; D.I. 9; D.I. 235, at 3. At the motion-to-dismiss stage, I held that each classifi-\ncation review was a separate alleged violation. D.I. 235, at 6\u20139. Working backward  \n7 from when he filed his complaint, his four most recent reviews were held on December \n9, 2009; October 30, 2008; November 6, 2007; and October 2, 2006. D.I. 277, at 14; \nD.I. 273-3, at 2\u201318. By those points, he had been in solitary confinement for about \nfive years and ten months, four years and eight months, three years and nine months, \nand two years and eight months, respectively. \n6. Defendants\u2019 involvement.  I previously dismissed two named defendants. \nD.I. 235, at 4\u20135. Five remain: Perry Phelps, David Pierce, James Scarborough, Linda \nKemp, and Larry Savage. From 2008 to 2010, Phelps was the warden and Pierce was \ndeputy warden. D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 30. From 2006 to 2010, Scarborough was security super-\nintendent, Kemp was a counselor, and Savage was a classification officer. D.I. 273-6, \nat 10; D.I. 273-9, at 10; D.I. 273-10, at 10. Defendants Kemp and Savage admit that \nthey participated in Brathwaite\u2019s classification reviews in 2008 and 2009. D.I. 278-1 \n\u00b6 29. They also admit that Kemp participated in the 2007 review. Id. Scarborough, \nPhelps, and Pierce oversaw the classification process but did not always directly in-\nfluence classification decisions. Id. \u00b6 30. Brathwaite also claims that each of these \nthree had a hand in the remain-in-SHU list. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 30. \nB. Legal background \n1. Summary judgment.  The parties now cross-move for summary judgment. \nD.I. 269, D.I. 271. \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows \nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In general, a dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d \nif a reasonable jury could find for either side. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 \nU.S. 242, 251\u201352 (1986). (The analysis for this case is more complex, but we will cross  \n8 that bridge when we come to it.) And a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it \u201ccould affect the out-\ncome.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey , 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011).  \nDefendants claim qualified immunity. D.I. 270, at 14\u201315, 19\u201320. In qualified- \nimmunity cases, there are two more summary-judgment requirements. First, I must \n\u201cspecify those material facts that are and are not subject to genuine dispute and ex-\nplain their materiality.\u201d Forbes v. Township of Lower Merion , 313 F.3d 144, 146 (3d \nCir. 2002). Second, I must \u201canalyze separately, and state findings with respect to, the \nspecific conduct of each [defendant].\u201d Grant v. City of Pittsburgh , 98 F.3d 116, 126 (3d \nCir. 1996). \n2. Qualified immunity and clearly established law . Even if officials violate the \nConstitution, they are entitled to qualified immunity unless the law was \u201cclearly es-\ntablished.\u201d Ziglar v. Abbasi , 582 U.S. 120, 151 (2017). In defining the relevant law, I \nmust be careful \u201cnot to define [it] at a high level of generality.\u201d Ashcroft v. al-Kidd , \n563 U.S. 731, 742 (2011). Instead, I look to the \u201cspecific context of the case.\u201d Mullenix \nv. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 12 (2015) (per curiam). \nThe \u201csalient question\u201d is whether \u201cthe state of the law\u201d gave reasonable officials \n\u201cfair warning.\u201d Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002). That warning comes through \ncase law. A prior case need not address \u201cthe very action in question,\u201d but it must make \nthe action\u2019s unlawfulness \u201capparent.\u201d Abassi, 582 U.S. at 151 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). Cases with \u201cfundamentally similar\u201d facts are \u201cstrong support\u201d that \nthe violation would be apparent. Hope, 536 U.S. at 741. Other times, though, \u201cgeneral \nstatements of the law \u2026 may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in  \n9 question.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Either way, the alleged violation \nmust have been clear to a reasonable officer when the action was taken. \nThe hierarchy of relevant case law reflects \u201cthe Judiciary\u2019s structure.\u201d Id. at 747. \nThat is, I \u201clook first for applicable Supreme Court precedent.\u201d Porter v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of \nCorr., 974 F.3d 431, 449 (3d Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). If there is \nno such precedent or it leaves ambiguity, I consider \u201ccontrolling authority in [the \nThird Circuit] or a robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority in the Courts of \nAppeals.\u201d Id. \nTwo more notes about qualified immunity. First, because clearly established law \nmust set a question \u201cbeyond debate,\u201d a circuit split is strong evidence that the law \nwas not clearly established. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741. Defendants do not refer to any \nsplits. But this area of law is riddled with them, so I will flag some along the way. \nUltimately, none affects this case\u2019s outcome. \nSecond, the Third Circuit has not settled whether plaintiffs (or defendants) have \nthe burden to show that the law was (or was not) clearly established. Compare Lozano \nv. New Jersey , 9 F.4th 239, 245 (3d Cir. 2021) (burden on plaintiff), with Jefferson v. \nLias, 21 F.4th 74, 80 (3d Cir. 2021) (burden on defendant). So I evaluate this question \nfrom a neutral starting point. \nWith all that in mind, I begin with whether Brathwaite had a liberty interest pro-\ntected by the Fourteenth Amendment. \nII. BRATHWAITE HAD A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED LIBERTY INTEREST  \nTo show a due-process violation, Brathwaite must prove two things: first, that he \nhad a liberty interest that could not be taken without due process; and second, that  \n10 he did not receive the process he was due. And to overcome qualified immunity, he \nmust show that his liberty interest and the process he was due were clearly established.  \nI begin with the first question and conclude that Brathwaite did have a clearly \nestablished liberty interest by the time of the 2007 violation. To reach that conclusion, \nI look at case law only before then (plus a few 2008 cases, which make the 2008 and \n2009 violations even clearer). Finally, I also canvass more recent cases to ensure that \nno intervening law would change the liberty-interest finding.  \nA. The liberty-interest standard \n1. The test.  Usually, a duly sentenced criminal has no right to complain about the \nroughness of prison life. But even an inmate has an interest in relative liberty. Under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, a prisoner\u2019s liberty interest can \narise in two ways. First, the Due Process Clause, \u201cof its own force,\u201d protects against \npunishments that exceed a prisoner\u2019s sentence. Sandin v. Conner , 515 U.S. 472, 484 \n(1995). Second, states can create liberty interests. Like most prisoner-liberty cases, \nthis one deals with the latter type of interest. In this category, prisoners have a due-\nprocess-protected interest in \u201cfreedom from restraint which \u2026 imposes atypical and sig-\nnificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d Id. \nThis hardship standard was clearly established in Sandin v. Conner . But it is too \nabstract. Though a prison official likely knows what is \u201catypical,\u201d \u201csignificant hard-\nship\u201d is malleable. So I must look to other cases to clarify this standard. Those other \ncases explain that hardship is a function of the confinement\u2019s (1) conditions and \n(2) duration. Shoats v. Horn , 213 F.3d 140, 144 (3d Cir. 2000). And \u201cthe ordinary in-\ncidents of prison life\u201d are measured by \u201c\u2018routine\u2019 prison conditions in \u2026 state  \n11 institutions.\u201d Id. Whether an inmate faced atypical and significant hardship is a ques-\ntion of law. Colon v. Howard , 215 F.3d 227, 230 (2d Cir. 2000). \n2. Historical residue.  For context, one should know that Sandin\u2019s hardship stand-\nard represented a shift. Previously, in cases like Hewitt v. Helms , the Court had held \nthat prison regulations\u2019 \u201cmandatory language\u201d could create a liberty interest. 459 \nU.S. 460, 472 (1983). Sandin departed from that framework for finding a liberty in-\nterest. But as we will see later, Hewitt\u2019s analysis about the process needed to vindicate a \nliberty interest survived. So pre-1995 cases remain relevant, but only for some purposes. \nThis shift created a circuit split. By 2007, some circuits thought (and think) that \nSandin created an additional requirement without disposing of the previous one. \nThat is, prisoners now had to point to both a mandatory policy and a substantial \nhardship. See Prieto v. Clarke , 780 F.3d 245, 249 & n.3  (4th Cir. 2015) (summarizing \nthe split). This split does not affect Brathwaite\u2019s claim for three reasons. First, de-\nfendants have not invoked it. Second, the Third Circuit\u2019s stance has been clear. Its \ncases do not require any mandatory prison policy. Shoats, 213 F.3d at 143. Third, \nBrathwaite can point to a policy. Prison policy here required annual classification \nreviews, with the prisoner\u2019s participation, and a notice of a decision. D.I. 273-8, at 21. \nWith Sandin\u2019s standard in hand, I evaluate whether the conditions and duration \nof Brathwaite\u2019s solitary confinement clearly imposed an atypical and significant hard-\nship on him in relation to routine prison life. \nB. Conditions \n1. The clearly established law.  As we will see, most of the case law focuses on du-\nration. As for conditions, the cases have not clearly held that certain conditions are  \n12 necessary or sufficient to create a liberty interest. Instead, the cases find a liberty in-\nterest when a prisoner spends long enough in typical solitary-confinement conditions.  \nStart with Supreme Court precedent. In Sandin, the Court held that the prisoner \nin solitary confinement there did not have a liberty interest. But Sandin said rela-\ntively little about confinement conditions. Instead, it focused on the short duration, \njust 30 days. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486. \nBy contrast, in Wilkinson v. Austin , the Court held that the prisoners there had a \nliberty interest. 545 U.S. 209, 223 (2005). The Court emphasized the prison\u2019s ban on \n\u201calmost all human contact,\u201d the twenty-four-hour artificial light in the cells, and the \nlimit to one hour of indoor recreation each day. Id. at 223\u201324. On top of this \u201cextreme \nisolation\u201d (and its \u201cindefinite\u201d duration, which I turn to later), the Court noted that \nthe prison made inmates ineligible for parole. Id. at 214, 224. \u201cWhile any of these \nconditions standing alone might not be sufficient to create a liberty interest, taken \ntogether they impose an atypical and significant hardship within the correctional \ncontext.\u201d Id. at 224. So Wilkinson  reveals what is sufficient, but not what is necessary. \nTo clarify that, I turn to Third Circuit precedent. \n By 2007, the seminal Third Circuit case on this subject was Shoats v. Horn . There, \nthe court found that the prisoner had a liberty interest. It noted these conditions of \nconfinement: \u201cvirtual isolation\u201d; confinement to his cell for \u201c23 hours a day, five days \na week\u201d; eating meals alone; no contact with his family; and no educational or other \nactivities. Shoats, 213 F.3d at 144. Yet in an earlier Third Circuit case, Griffin v.  \n13 Vaughn, the court found that a prisoner held in similar conditions did not have a \nliberty interest. 112 F.3d 703, 708 (3d Cir. 1997).  \nThese different outcomes are explained by the prisoners\u2019 vastly different durations \nin solitary. While Griffin had been in solitary for fifteen months, Shoats had done \neight years. Again, I will explore duration in more detail below. But these cases reveal \ntwo things. First, solitary confinement imposes an atypical and significant hardship \nsufficient for a liberty interest\u2014if paired with a substantial duration. Second, losing \nparole eligibility is not necessary: even though Shoats predates Wilkinson , Shoats \nremains good law and does not mention parole. \nBy 2007, other circuits also viewed \u201cstandard SHU conditions\u201d as sufficiently re-\nstrictive. Colon, 215 F.3d at 231\u201332; see also Magluta v. Samples , 375 F.3d 1269 (11th \nCir. 2004) (finding a liberty interest for similar conditions).  \nTrue, there was (and is) a circuit split relating to this question. The circuits disa-\ngree about the relevant baseline when determining \u201cordinary\u201d prison conditions. \nSome circuits hold that administrative segregation is itself an ordinary incident of \nprison life, so it forms the baseline. Hatch v. District of Columbia , 184 F.3d 846, 851 \n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (summarizing the split). (Administrative segregation is yet another \nway to refer to solitary confinement. In contrast to disciplinary segregation, admin-\nistrative segregation is typically longer and not necessarily triggered by a specific \nviolation of prison rules.) \nYet this split does not affect Brathwaite\u2019s claim for three reasons. First, defend-\nants have not invoked it. Second, by 2007, the Third Circuit\u2019s baseline was clearly  \n14 established. True, some other circuits have cited Griffin for the proposition that the \nThird Circuit considers administrative segregation the relevant baseline. See, e.g., id. \nat 851. But Shoats came three years after Griffin, and it looked to \u201c\u2018routine\u2019 prison \nconditions in Pennsylvania state institutions.\u201d Shoats, 213 F.3d at 144. And when \ndiscussing Shoats\u2019s confinement, the court compared it to the entire prisoner popula-\ntion. Id. Third, all circuits consider the duration of solitary confinement. See Harden-\nBey v. Rutter , 524 F.3d 789, 793 (6th Cir. 2008) (Sutton, J.) (collecting cases). So even \nin circuits that consider administrative segregation the baseline, that just shifts the \nfocus to duration. See, e.g., Hatch, 184 F.3d at 858.  \nAs I turn to Brathwaite\u2019s conditions, keep in mind that they must have imposed \nan atypical and significant hardship on him and that the conditions in Wilkinson  and \nShoats are good examples of such hardship. \n2. Brathwaite\u2019s conditions.  Brathwaite\u2019s conditions in solitary confinement were \nsubstantially harsher than those in the general population. Brathwaite was isolated: \nHe was alone in his cell about twenty-three hours per day. Some days, he was not \nallowed to leave. Outside his cell, he was handcuffed. His recreation was limited to \nbodyweight exercises in a cage. He had little to no contact with fellow prisoners. And \nthough he was allowed some phone calls, educational programs, and visitors, those \nprivileges were restricted. All these restraints distinguish his treatment from that of \nthe general population, making his confinement clearly atypical. \nThese limits are akin to those in Wilkinson  and Shoats, clearly making his con-\nfinement a significant hardship too. The table below compares Brathwaite\u2019s  \n16 prisoners through the vents too. Even so, his secure housing was \u201csynonymous with \nextreme isolation.\u201d Wilkinson , 545 U.S. at 214. \nTrue, there is one more significant difference. As mentioned, Wilkinson  empha-\nsized that, there, \u201cotherwise eligible\u201d prisoners lost parole eligibility. Id. at 224. That \nconsequence, \u201ctaken together\u201d with isolation and the duration of confinement, gave \nrise to a liberty interest. Id. Here, otherwise eligible prisoners in secure housing lost \nfurlough eligibility. D.I. 273-8, at 12. But Brathwaite was not eligible for furlough \nanyway. See 11 Del. C. \u00a7 6538(e). \nIn some cases, this distinction might make a difference. But Shoats shows that a \ncollateral consequence, like losing parole eligibility, is not strictly necessary. Parole \nrevocation or not, Brathwaite\u2019s conditions \u201cdiffer[ed] significantly from \u2018routine\u2019 \nprison conditions.\u201d Shoats, 213 F.3d at 144. His conditions were isolating and strik-\ningly similar to other cases that found a protected liberty interest. And recall that the \ncases need not be carbon copies. \u201cFundamentally\u201d or \u201cmaterially\u201d similar facts are \n\u201cstrong\u201d support that the law was clearly established. Hope, 536 U.S. at 741. So \nBrathwaite\u2019s conditions of solitary confinement were sufficient to create a liberty in-\nterest, so long as they were paired with a substantial duration. \nC. Duration \nNow turn to the second hardship factor: duration. To support a liberty interest, \nBrathwaite\u2019s duration in solitary confinement must have been sufficiently \u201cprolonged \nand indefinite.\u201d Porter, 974 F.3d at 450. (Though the cited case using this helpful \nphrase was published in 2020, these two considerations clearly framed the duration \nanalysis by 2007\u2014as the discussion below shows.)   \n17 1. About three years in solitary confinement was clearly established as prolonged.  \nAgain start with Supreme Court precedent. Sandin held that 30 days in solitary con-\nfinement was insufficient. And Wilkinson  dealt with a class action, so it did not ana-\nlyze individual periods of confinement. Instead, it emphasized the confinement\u2019s in-\ndefiniteness. We will turn to indefiniteness next. But the Third Circuit and other \ncourts of appeals have also considered the prisoner\u2019s actual duration in solitary con-\nfinement, and whether that duration was prolonged.  \n(As an aside, I note that this backward-looking approach is not how we typically \nthink about due process. See, e.g., Wilkinson , 545 U.S. at 223 (describing the \u201cstate-\ncreated liberty interest in avoiding  restrictive conditions of confinement\u201d (emphasis \nadded)). But precedent requires it. And it makes some practical sense in the less-\nthan-formal prison context, where periods of solitary confinement might not be clear \nat the outset. Plus, looking to actual outcomes to determine whether the process was \nsufficient is not unheard of. See, e.g., Scott v. Illinois , 440 U.S. 367, 373 (1979) (estab-\nlishing actual-imprisonment standard for right to counsel).) \nTurning to Third Circuit precedent, again the key case is Shoats. There, the court \nheld that \u201cShoats\u2019 eight-year confinement subjects him to conditions that differ sig-\nnificantly from \u2018routine\u2019 prison conditions.\u201d 213 F.3d at 144. Later Third Circuit opin-\nions have consistently measured a given inmate\u2019s period of solitary confinement \nagainst Shoats\u2019s eight-year yardstick. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Horn , 318 F.3d 523, 532 \n(3d Cir. 2003) (string citation comparing durations); see also Fraise v. Terhune , 283 \nF.3d 506, 523 (3d Cir. 2002) (same).  \n18 At the other end of the Third Circuit\u2019s spectrum is Griffin. There, the court held \nthat fifteen months in solitary confinement did not create a liberty interest. 112 F.3d \nat 708. (\u201cExposure to the conditions of administrative custody for periods as long as  \n15 months falls within the expected parameters of the sentence imposed [on him] by \na court of law.\u201d (emphasis added, alteration in original, internal quotation marks \nomitted)). In another case, Mitchell v. Horn , the court suggested that eighteen months \nwould not create a liberty interest because the \u201cmarginal difference [of three months] \nd[id] not appear to cross the constitutional line.\u201d Mitchell , 318 F.3d at 532. Nonethe-\nless, it remanded to develop the record. Id. So by 2007, the Third Circuit had set \nliberty-interest guideposts at fifteen (or eighteen) months and eight years. To fill in \nthe vast middle, I turn to other courts of appeals. \nBy 2007, the circuits were divided over claims in the one-to-two-year range; yet as \ndefendants themselves quote  in their brief, \u201c[t]he duration in segregated confinement \nthat courts have found does not give rise to a liberty interest ranges up to two and \none-half years.\u201d D.I. 277, at 16 (emphasis added) (quoting Wilkerson v. Goodwin , 774 \nF.3d 845, 855 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing only pre-2009 cases)). Compare  Jones v. Baker , \n155 F.3d 810, 812 (6th Cir. 1998) (no liberty interest for two and a half years), Estate \nof DiMarco v. Wyo. Dep\u2019t of Corr. , 473 F.3d 1334, 1343\u201344 (10th Cir. 2007) (fourteen \nmonths), Hernandez v. Velasquez , 522 F.3d 556, 563\u201364 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) \n(one year in a shared cell), Beverati v. Smith , 120 F.3d 500, 503\u201304 (4th Cir. 1997) \n(six months), Sealey v. Giltner , 197 F.3d 578, 589 (2d Cir. 1999) (101 days), Townsend \nv. Fuchs , 522 F.3d 765, 767, 772 (7th Cir. 2008) (fifty-nine days), and Skinner v.  \n19 Cunningham , 430 F.3d 483, 486\u201387 (1st Cir. 2005) (forty days), with Fogle v. Pierson , \n435 F.3d 1252, 1259 (10th Cir. 2006) (prisoner could state a due-process claim for \nthree years), Kelly v. Brewer, 525 F.2d 394, 400\u201302 (8th Cir. 1975) (same), Harden-\nBey, 524 F.3d at 793 (same), and Trujillo v. Williams , 465 F.3d 1210, 1225 (10th Cir. \n2006) (750 days states a claim), and with  Tellier v. Fields , 280 F.3d 69, 80 (2d Cir. \n2000) (514 days establishes a liberty interest), Magluta , 375 F.3d at 1282 (about 500 \ndays), and Colon, 215 F.3d at 231\u201332 (305 days). \nBy 2007, a \u201crobust consensus of cases of persuasive authority in the Courts of \nAppeals\u201d set the benchmark around three years. Porter, 974 F.3d at 449 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). So it was clearly established that solitary-confinement pe-\nriods beyond three years gave rise to a liberty interest, especially when bolstered by \nindefiniteness. \n2. Indefiniteness was also clearly established.  By 2007, indefiniteness was also \nclearly established as a key part of the liberty-interest inquiry. In Wilkinson , the Su-\npreme Court found that the prisoners\u2019 liberty interest was especially strong because \nthe solitary confinement was \u201cindefinite and \u2026 reviewed just annually\u201d; it was \u201clim-\nited only by an inmate\u2019s sentence.\u201d Id. at 214\u201315, 224. The Court contrasted this in-\ndefinite administrative  segregation with the defined thirty-day period of disciplinary  \nsegregation in Sandin. Id. at 224. Without a specified end date, the solitary confine-\nment was literally indefinite. \nThe Third Circuit has also emphasized indefiniteness. But the division between \n\u201cprolonged\u201d and \u201cindefinite\u201d is not clean. The former can signal the latter. As I noted  \n20 earlier, in the fast-moving prison-discipline context, lacking a clear end date does not \nalways mean that solitary confinement will continue indefinitely. For example, \nnearly all the no-liberty-interest cases involved segregation pending investigation. \nSee, e.g., Skinner, 430 F.3d at 486; Townsend , 522 F.3d at 771; Griffin, 112 F.3d at \n705; Mitchell , 318 F.3d at 527; Jones, 155 F.3d at 812. Although the end date was not \nexplicit, it was tied to an external force with its own timeline. So the period of con-\nfinement was more definite. \nBut when a prisoner is kept in solitary for less well-defined reasons, the Third \nCircuit has looked to prolongation to inform indefiniteness. In Shoats, the court de-\nscribed \u201ceight years in administrative custody, with no prospect of immediate release \nin the near future\u201d as \u201cindefinite segregation.\u201d 213 F.3d at 144.  \nMims v. Shapp  provides another important data point. 744 F.2d 946 (3d Cir. \n1984). This pre- Sandin case\u2019s liberty-interest discussion is still good law as far as it \ndoes not rely on regulations\u2019 mandatory language. In that surviving part of the opin-\nion, the court noted that five years in solitary plus \u201cthe prison administrator ha[ving] \ncontemplated no change\u201d showed that the \u201cadministrative segregation was of poten-\ntially limitless duration.\u201d 744 F.2d at 951. \nOther circuits have also viewed prolonged periods as indefinite. See, e.g., Harden-\nBey, 524 F.3d at 793 (three years in solitary could state a due-process claim because \nit \u201cnot improbably\u201d shows \u201cthat [the prisoner\u2019s] placement remains \u2018indefinite.\u2019\u201d).  \n21 Thus, it was clearly established by 2007 that (1) a multiyear period in solitary \nconfinement with no end date was considered indefinite and (2) an indefinite period \nin solitary confinement created a liberty interest. \n3. Measuring the duration of Brathwaite\u2019s confinement.  Before considering the \nlength of Brathwaite\u2019s detention, I must first resolve a dispute about how to measure \nthat time. Brathwaite argues that I should look at the full six and a half years be-\ntween his initial move to solitary and when he filed this lawsuit. D.I. 279, at 5\u201314. \nDefendants, on the other hand, point out that the statute of limitations is two years. \nD.I. 277, at 12\u201318. So they contend that I should look at only the two years of con-\nfinement preceding the complaint. Id. \nBoth miss the mark. The relevant durations are measured on the dates that the \nviolations occurred. In my motion-to-dismiss opinion, I held that \u201ca discrete claim \narose every time [Braithwaite] did not receive a review.\u201d D.I. 235, at 7. So the dates \non which the allegedly deficient classification reviews occurred (not, as Brathwaite \nargues, the date that the complaint was filed) are the relevant endpoints. \nBut the starting point is not, as defendants claim, limited by the two-year statute \nof limitations. The duration of Brathwaite\u2019s solitary confinement is simply one of the \nfacts supporting his claim. The limitations period bars untimely legal claims; it says \nnothing about facts or evidence that support a timely claim. Thus, the relevant period \nruns from when Brathwaite was initially placed in solitary to the time of each review.  \nSo the two-year statute of limitations began to run, at the earliest, on the date of \neach alleged violation. Recall that Brathwaite filed his complaint in 2010. As  \n22 defendants concede, the 2008 and 2009 claims are timely. As for the 2007 claim, I will \naddress Brathwaite\u2019s tolling arguments at the end of this opinion. And at the time of \nthe alleged 2007, 2008, and 2009 violations, Brathwaite had been in solitary confine-\nment for three years and nine months, four years and eight months, and five years \nand ten months. \nNor do Brathwaite\u2019s brief stints outside solitary change this analysis. Recall that \nafter about seven months in solitary, Brathwaite was transferred to medium-high-\nsecurity housing for just three days before being sent back. And shortly thereafter, \nhe spent two periods in the infirmary, totaling about three months. Defendants point \nout these transfers but do not argue that they reset the solitary-confinement clock\u2014\nnor could they. Otherwise, a prison could transfer an inmate from solitary to the gen-\neral population for one day each year and evade classification reviews entirely. Plus, \nduring his times in the infirmary, he was still technically housed in solitary confine-\nment. Even if I subtracted these few months from his total time in solitary, he still \nwould have spent about three and a half years in solitary by his 2007 review. That \nduration would still clearly establish a liberty interest. \n4. Brathwaite\u2019s confinement was clearly prolonged and indefinite.  By 2007, \nBrathwaite\u2019s confinement was prolonged. Even defendants admit that his duration \nin solitary was atypical. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 28. And his forty-five-month period was already \nthree times as long as that in Griffin and more than a year longer than the top end \nof the no-liberty-interest range described above. These differences are far from the \n\u201cmarginal\u201d three months in Mitchell . 318 F.3d at 532.  \n23 Brathwaite\u2019s confinement was also indefinite. True, his initial transfer to solitary \nmight have been for a defined disciplinary period (though the record reveals no pre-\ndetermined end date). D.I. 273-3, at 47. But it became indefinite administrative seg-\nregation due to his \u201cproblematic behavior.\u201d Id. at 37; see also D.I. 273-6, at 18\u201319; \nD.I. 273-13, at 68 (describing inmates\u2019 ability to \u201cflow down through the classification \nprocess\u201d as not being on \u201ca set time frame\u201d). So his solitary confinement was literally \nindefinite. \nTwo other facts also show that his detention was indefinite. First is prolongation. \nIn Mims, the prisoner had been in solitary for five years. Likewise, by 2008, \nBrathwaite had been in solitary for around five years without a plan to move him. By \n2007, it had been nearly four years, still more than enough to suggest indefiniteness. \nSee Harden-Bey , 524 F.3d at 793. Second is the remain-in-SHU list. Recall that the \nparties dispute exactly how this list was used. But they do not dispute that the list \ninfluenced Brathwaite\u2019s 2007, 2008, and 2009 reviews\u2014the review forms themselves \nsay so. And defendants do not dispute that it is at least rare, if not impossible, for an \ninmate on the list to return to the general population. So Brathwaite\u2019s being on this \nlist also suggests that his solitary confinement was indefinite. \nDefendants cite some other cases, but they are unpersuasive. Many of those opin-\nions are unpublished, from district courts, or both. See D.I. 277, at 16; D.I. 278, at 17;  \nHope, 536 U.S. at 747. And even then, they muster just one case holding that a  \nsolitary-confinement period as long or longer than Brathwaite\u2019s did not create a lib-\nerty interest. See Jordan v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons , 191 Fed. Appx. 639, 642 (10th  \n24 Cir. 2006). That case is unpublished, involves segregation pending investigation, and \nimproperly mixes the state\u2019s interest into the liberty-interest analysis. See id. at 642, \n650\u201353. Defendants are too far out on a limb for it to support the weight of their \nargument. \n* * * * * \n By 2007, Brathwaite had a clearly established liberty interest in avoiding a harsh, \nprolonged, and indefinite period of solitary confinement. His case is \u201cmaterially\u201d\u2014if \nnot \u201cfundamentally\u201d\u2014similar to many other cases finding the same. Hope, 536 U.S. \nat 741. Though any one of Brathwaite\u2019s restrictive conditions \u201cstanding alone might \nnot be sufficient to create a liberty interest,\u201d the conditions\u2019 severity, duration, and \nindefiniteness, \u201ctaken together[,] \u2026 impose[d] an atypical and significant hardship.\u201d \nWilkinson , 545 U.S. at 224. \nThe same cannot be said for the alleged 2006 violation. By then, he had been in \nsolitary for two years and eight months. That period is barely longer than the two \nand a half years at the upper end of the no-liberty-interest range. A reasonable officer \ncould think that the two-month difference was \u201cmarginal,\u201d like the three-month dif-\nference in Mitchell . So that claim misses the clearly established cutoff. See Brown v. \nOr. Dep\u2019t of Corr. , 751 F.3d 983, 988\u201390 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding right not clearly es-\ntablished because circuit had not yet held that twenty-seven months was sufficient). \nD. Post-2009 cases confirm Brathwaite\u2019s liberty interest \nCases after 2009 cannot clearly establish the law to officers at the time of the \nviolations. But they could change my present evaluation of whether Brathwaite had \na liberty interest. For example, if Wilkinson  or Shoats were overturned after 2009, I  \n25 would need to apply the new law. But nothing like that has happened here. To the \ncontrary, post-2009 case law only confirms Brathwaite\u2019s liberty interest. \nThe Supreme Court has not elaborated on Wilkinson , but the Third Circuit has \nissued some informative decisions since 2009. In Williams v. Pennsylvania Secretary \nof Department of Corrections , the court held that a prisoner in solitary confinement for \nsix years had a liberty interest. 848 F.3d 549, 554\u201355 (3d Cir. 2017). It saw \u201cno mean-\ningful distinction\u201d between that six-year period and the eight-year period in Shoats. Id. \nat 561. And it described his confinement as \u201cindefinite.\u201d Id. at 562. (The court went on \nto hold that the prisoner\u2019s right was not clearly established, but that was because the \nprisoner was in the unusual situation of being housed on death row with a vacated \ndeath sentence. Id. at 570\u201371. The case law had not yet addressed that situation. Id.) \nSimilarly, in Porter v. Pennsylvania Department of Corrections , the Third Circuit \nheld that a prisoner who had spent decades in solitary confinement had a liberty \ninterest. 974 F.3d at 438. Though that prisoner\u2019s solitary-confinement period was \nlonger than Brathwaite\u2019s, the court described the \u201cwide consensus that prolonged and \nindefinite solitary confinement gives rise to a due process liberty interest.\u201d Id. at 450. \nIt cited a string of cases for that proposition, many of which found liberty interests \nfor solitary-confinement periods shorter than Brathwaite\u2019s. Id. at 449\u201350. \nPlus, Porter confirmed that a claim can still be clearly established despite minor \nvariations in conditions. Though Porter was \u201cmindful that there [we]re some distinc-\ntions,\u201d they were not enough to \u201cdistinguish [plaintiff\u2019s case] for the purposes of his \nprocedural due process rights.\u201d Id. at 438\u201339. Other circuits agree. See Wilkerson ,  \n26 774 F.3d at 855 (\u201cThough there are some distinctions \u2026 notably that no parole ram-\nifications appear to attach \u2026 there are material and substantial similarities.\u201d); In-\ncumaa v. Stirling , 791 F.3d 517, 532 (4th Cir. 2015) (noting that Wilkinson  \u201cdid not \nengage in a point-by-point comparison of the conditions that inmates experienced in \na supermax facility with the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d).  \nOne recent Fourth Circuit case is particularly on point. In Smith v. Collins , the \ncourt found that a roughly four-year period in solitary could support a liberty interest. \n964 F.3d 266, 281 (4th Cir. 2020). There, too, defendants said that the prisoner spoke \nwith counselors and guards. But the court found that speaking with \u201c[c]orrectional \nstaff do[es] not obviate the need for social interaction.\u201d Id. at 277. \nAs for duration, the court acknowledged that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cperiod of segregated \nconfinement is quite shy of\u201d the decades-long periods in some other cases. Id. at 278. \n\u201cBut four years and three months is far longer than the thirty-day period at issue in \nSandin,\u201d and it \u201cexceeds the length of various periods that other courts have found \ninsufficient to trigger a liberty interest, which range[] up to two and one-half years.\u201d \nId. at 278\u201379 (internal quotation marks omitted, alteration in original). And it noted \nthat a four-year \u201cduration of \u2026 confinement in administrative segregation \u2026 \nstrengthen[ed] [plaintiff\u2019s] evidentiary showing of indefiniteness.\u201d Id. at 278. \nSo too here. \u201c[P]risoners need not languish in solitary confinement for decades on \nend in order to possess a cognizable liberty interest \u2026 . The four-plus years that \n[Brathwaite] spent in administrative segregation is significant enough to tip the scales \nin his favor, particularly in light of the other evidence of indefiniteness.\u201d Id. at 269.  \n27 III. BRATHWAITE HAD A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED DUE-PROCESS RIGHT \nBecause Brathwaite had a liberty interest, some process was due. But due process \nis flexible. It involves case-specific balancing and, usually, is the kind of \u201cextremely \nabstract\u201d right unlikely to be clearly established. Abassi, 582 U.S. at 151 (internal \nquotation marks omitted); Mathews v. Eldridge , 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). Yet in the \nsolitary-confinement context, the Supreme Court and Third Circuit here boiled down \nthe Constitution\u2019s abstract standard to a series of concrete rules. Well before 2007, \ncourts had clearly established the required minimum procedures: notice, an oppor-\ntunity to be heard, and an explanation of the decision. \n1. Formal and informal procedures.  Formal procedures are required \u201cwhere the \nright at stake is to be free from confinement.\u201d Wilkinson , 545 U.S. at 225 (emphasis \nadded). But when the liberty interest is in the nature of confinement, \u201cthe inquiry \ndraws more on the experience of prison administrators, and \u2026 the State\u2019s interest \nimplicates the safety of other inmates and prison personnel.\u201d Id. at 228\u201329. So \u201cinfor-\nmal, nonadversary procedures\u201d suffice. Id. at 229. For instance, in Greenholtz v. In-\nmates of Nebraska Penal & Correctional Complex , the Court addressed the level of \nprocess due for inmates seeking parole. 442 U.S. 1, 16 (1979); Wilkinson , 545 U.S. at \n229. It held that only an opportunity to be heard and notice of \u201cthe reason for [pa-\nrole\u2019s] denial\u201d were required, not a formal hearing and a summary of the evidence. \nGreenholtz , 442 U.S. at 15\u201316. \n2. Initial transfers to solitary.  The same is true in the most analogous cases here, \nHewitt and Wilkinson . Hewitt dealt with initial transfers to administrative segrega-\ntion. 459 U.S. at 473. Because the \u201cdecision that an inmate \u2026 represents a threat to  \n28 the institution\u2019s security\u201d involves \u201cintuitive judgments,\u201d the Court required \u201conly an \ninformal nonadversary review of evidence.\u201d Id. at 474. That is, \u201c[a]n inmate must \nmerely receive some notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present \nhis views to the prison official charged with deciding whether to transfer him to ad-\nministrative segregation.\u201d Id. at 476. At bottom, Hewitt requires the two pillars of \ndue process: \u201cnotice \u2026 and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d Wilkinson , 545 U.S. at 229 \n(summarizing Hewitt). \nWilkinson  required the same. There, the Court said that Greenholtz  and Hewitt \n\u201cprovide[d] the appropriate model,\u201d requiring notice, an opportunity to be heard, and \nan explanation of the decision. Id. at 228\u201329. In Wilkinson , the prisoners got \u201cnotice \nof the factual basis leading to consideration for [supermax] placement and a fair op-\nportunity for rebuttal.\u201d Id. at 226. The Court emphasized that \u201cthese are among the \nmost important procedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous depriva-\ntions.\u201d Id. at 226. Those mechanisms were enough to \u201csafeguard an inmate\u2019s liberty \ninterest.\u201d Id. at 228. So Hewitt and Wilkinson  both held that initial transfers to ad-\nministrative segregation required notice, an opportunity to be heard, and some ex-\nplanation of the decision.  \n3. Periodic review.  On top of that shared holding, Hewitt went a step further. It \nnoted that \u201cadministrative segregation may not be used as a pretext for indefinite \nconfinement,\u201d so \u201cofficials must engage in some sort of periodic review.\u201d Hewitt, 459 \nU.S. at 477 n.9. It added that this periodic \u201creview will not necessarily require that \nprison officials permit the submission of any additional evidence or statements.\u201d Id.  \n29 But periodic review should ensure that the inmate stays in solitary only if he \u201cre-\nmains a security risk.\u201d Id. So Hewitt clearly established that meaningful periodic re-\nview was necessary. \nOther circuits have reached the same conclusion, holding that Hewitt clearly es-\ntablished the process due for prisoners in extended solitary confinement. One case \nwas published before 2007. Magluta , 375 F.3d at 1283\u201384 (\u201c[A]mple federal law ex-\nisted \u2026 to give fair warning \u2026 that it was unconstitutional to hold Magluta in solitary \nconfinement for 500 days for the purpose of punishment and with virtually no proce-\ndural protection in the form of periodic reviews.\u201d). \nOthers were published after 2007, but they confirm the scope of what Hewitt \nclearly established well before then. See Selby v. Caruso , 734 F.3d 554, 560 (6th Cir. \n2013) (\u201c[S]ince Hewitt v. Helms , prison officials have been on notice that \u2018administra-\ntive segregation may not be used as a pretext for indefinite confinement of an in-\nmate.\u2019\u201d (quoting Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 477 n.9)); Isby v. Brown , 856 F.3d 508, 529\u201330 \n(2017) (\u201cAfter all, prison officials have been on notice since Hewitt that periodic re-\nviews of administrative segregation are constitutionally required, and it is self-evi-\ndent that they cannot be a sham.\u201d); Toevs v. Reid , 685 F.3d 903, 916 (10th Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cSince Hewitt, it has been clearly established that prisoners cannot be placed indef-\ninitely in administrative segregation without receiving meaningful periodic re-\nviews.\u201d).  Some meaningful periodic review, then, was clearly established by 2007. \n4. Procedures to renew the term in solitary.  By 2007, the Third Circuit had clarified \nHewitt\u2019s periodic-review requirement, requiring the same level of process as initial  \n30 reviews. In Sourbeer v. Robinson , it rejected the distinction between \u201cinitial place-\nments in restrictive housing [and] subsequent renewals of such placements.\u201d 791 F.2d \n1094, 1104 n.8 (3d Cir. 1986). It \u201cs[aw] no basis \u2026 to conclude that less process is due \nto [a] prisoner facing a second or third \u2018term\u2019 in restrictive housing than is due upon \ninitial placement.\u201d Id. These renewals still require \u201cthe most fundamental right of \ndue process: a meaningful  opportunity to be heard.\u201d Id. at 1101 (emphasis in original). \n(And this pre- Sandin case remains good law on this point, clarifying Hewitt\u2019s surviv-\ning model of process.) \nSo by 2007, it was clearly established that, before renewing a term in solitary, pris-\noners were due notice, an opportunity to be heard, and some explanation of the decision.  \n5. Frequency of periodic reviews.  Of course, what counts as another \u201cterm\u201d of soli-\ntary is not always clear. And the law gives officials some flexibility. But the case law \nreflects clear norms. Shoats, Sourbeer , and Hewitt all involved monthly reviews. \nShoats, 213 F.3d at 144\u201345; Sourbeer , 791 F.2d at 1101; Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 477 n.9; \nsee also Mims, 744 F.2d at 949; Clark v. Brewer , 776 F.2d 226, 234 (8th Cir. 1985); \nSheley v. Dugger, 833 F.2d 1420, 1427\u201328 (11th Cir. 1987).  \nWilkinson  involved annual reviews. But language in that opinion suggests that \nabout one year between reviews is the longest permissible gap. Wilkinson , 545 U.S. \nat 224 (noting that the segregation was \u201cindefinite and \u2026 reviewed just annually\u201d \n(emphasis added)); see also Kelly, 525 F.2d at 400 (\u201c[The] reasons for the segregation \nmust not only be valid at the outset but must continue to subsist during the period of  \n31 the segregation. \u2026 [A] reason for administrative segregation of an inmate that is valid \ntoday may not necessarily be valid six months or a year in the future.\u201d) \nThis range of discretion is reflected in Ninth Circuit precedent, which, by 2007, \nhad held that the top end of the range was somewhere between 120 and 365 days. \nCompare  Toussaint v. McCarthy  (Toussaint III ), 801 F.2d 1080, 1101 (9th Cir. 1986), \nwith Toussaint v. McCarthy  (Toussaint V ), 926 F.2d 800, 803 (9th Cir. 1990). So it \nwas clearly established that periodic reviews had to happen at least once a year or so. \n* * * * * \nSince Hewitt and Sourbeer , it has been clearly established that, before renewing \na prisoner\u2019s term in solitary for another year, prison officials must meaningfully pro-\nvide notice of the charges, an opportunity to be heard, and some explanation of the \ndecision. (And as with the liberty-interest analysis, no intervening law changes this \nconclusion.) These requirements \u201care not elaborate, but they are real, and must be \nstrictly complied with.\u201d Hatch, 184 F.3d at 852 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIV. THERE IS A GENUINE DISPUTE OVER \nWHETHER BRATHWAITE GOT DUE PROCESS \nBy 2007, case law had clearly established both Brathwaite\u2019s liberty interest and \nthe process he was due. And as noted earlier, the facts supporting Brathwaite\u2019s lib-\nerty interest are undisputed. So if the record (viewed in the light most favorable to \nBrathwaite) raises a genuine dispute about whether defendants did not provide the \nrequired process, they are not entitled to summary judgment. The record does that. \nSo I deny their summary-judgment motion.   \n32 But Brathwaite wants me to go a step further and grant his motion. As he reads \nthe record, he sees no genuine dispute over whether he got due process. Defendants \nhave not done much to fight this point. But because the record is so foggy, Brathwaite \nis not entitled to summary judgment either. \nA. Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment \nBrathwaite has pointed to enough in the record to create a genuine dispute over \nwhether defendants fell short of Hewitt\u2019s and Sourbeer \u2019s requirements. First, he says \nhe never got notice or an opportunity to be heard. Though his classification reviews \ndid happen annually, he says he was never present for or given a chance to participate \nin those reviews. D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 12; D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 12; D.I. 273-2, at 69:5\u201310. Second, he \nsays officials did not give him any explanation of at least some of their decisions. See, \ne.g., D.I. 273-2, at 34:8\u201322, 76:11\u201322. \nAnd even if Brathwaite did receive his classification forms, their explanations \nwere barebones. In 2009, his risk-assessment score qualified him for minimum secu-\nrity. But officials checked the box labeled \u201cOther\u201d under \u201cDiscretionary Overrides.\u201d \nD.I. 273-3, at 5. As explanation, officials referred to the \u201cRemain in SHU list,\u201d \n\u201cBrathwaite[\u2019s] \u2026 long history of not following the rules of this institution,\u201d and his \nrecent \u201cminor write-ups.\u201d Id. at 4\u20135. His reviews in 2007 and 2008 were much the \nsame story. Though he qualified for medium security, the remain-in-SHU list and his \n2004 assault on a staff member justified keeping him in solitary. Id. at 10\u201311.  \nAgain, it is unclear whether Brathwaite actually got these or any other explana-\ntions. But even if he did, \u201cchecking a preprinted box\u201d accompanied by a \u201cperfunctory\u201d \njustification is unlikely to constitute \u201cmeaningful\u201d review. Williams v. Hobbs , 662  \n33 F.3d 994, 1001\u201306 (8th Cir. 2011); Incumaa , 791 F.3d at 523. And if the remain-in-\nSHU list was used to shortcut or override other procedures, it also might have ren-\ndered the process meaningless. \nBeyond the reviews, defendants mention Brathwaite\u2019s letters to the warden and \nhis consultations with his counselor, but neither of these afforded much protection. \nHis letters merely sought process. Without notice, he could not hope to meaningfully \nrebut the charges. Plus, \u201cnothing in the record shows that prison officials even con-\nsidered the claims [Brathwaite] raised in his letters.\u201d Hatch, 184 F.3d at 852. In fact, \nBrathwaite says he stopped writing at one point because he never got a response. \nD.I. 273-2, at 47:16\u201323, 100:14\u201321. \nAnd he spoke with his counselor about only his quality-of-life level, not his classi-\nfication. D.I. 273-2, at 67:16\u201369:7; D.I. 273-9, at 24:7\u201325:7; D.I. 278-1 \u00b6 5. Even if they \ndid discuss classification, Hewitt requires \u201can opportunity to present his views to the \nprison official charged with deciding whether to transfer him.\u201d 459 U.S. at 476. Here, \nthe warden and the two committees made that decision. Though Brathwaite\u2019s coun-\nselor was a member of one of the committees, relaying his views through an interme-\ndiary is unlikely to be an adequate substitute for presenting his views himself. \nSo on at least one version of events, defendants violated Brathwaite\u2019s clearly es-\ntablished right.  \nB. Neither is Brathwaite \n1. The genuine-dispute burden-shifting framework.  But that version of events re-\nlies almost entirely on Brathwaite\u2019s own testimony. That is a thin reed on which to \ngrant summary judgment. Strikingly, however, defendants have failed to refute that  \n34 testimony. Instead, their summary-judgment briefs focus exclusively on the statute \nof limitations, Brathwaite\u2019s liberty interest, and qualified immunity. They do not ad-\ndress whether Brathwaite got any process. Yet that omission does not automatically \nmean that there is no genuine dispute over the process that Brathwaite got. To un-\nderstand why, I now explain the more complex meaning of \u201cgenuine dispute.\u201d \nWhether a dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d depends on burden-shifting. The moving party \nmust first, by \u201cciting to particular \u2026 materials in the record,\u201d show that \u201ca fact cannot \nbe \u2026 genuinely disputed.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 \nU.S. 317, 325 (1986). If the movant shows the absence of a genuine dispute, the bur-\nden shifts to the nonmovant to cite materials reestablishing it. Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(c)(1)(A); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Though I \u201cneed consider only the cited mate-\nrials,\u201d I \u201cmay consider other materials in the record.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). \nSometimes, the burden never shifts. For instance, the movant\u2019s evidence, when \n\u201cviewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party,\u201d might itself reveal a dis-\npute or \u201cfail[] to foreclose the possibility\u201d of one. Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co. , 398 \nU.S. 144, 157 (1970); see also 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure  \u00a7 2727.2 (4th ed. 2022). The movant is less \nlikely to carry his initial burden when he relies on his own testimony or exclusive \nknowledge of the events. See Adickes, 398 U.S. at 157\u201361; Wright, Miller & Kane \n\u00a7 2727.2. When the movant fails to carry his burden, summary judgment must be \ndenied, \u201ceven if the opposing party has not introduced contradictory evidence in re-\nsponse.\u201d Wright, Miller & Kane \u00a7 2727.1. In essence, summary judgment is  \n35 appropriate only when the truth is clear. See Poller v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc. , 368 \nU.S. 464, 467 (1962). \nParticularly in constitutional cases, even the slightest doubt can \u201ctip the balance\u201d \nagainst granting summary judgment. See Hunt v. Cromartie , 526 U.S. 541, 553 \n(1999); Hayes v. Cape Henlopen Sch. Dist. , 341 F. Supp. 823 (D. Del. 1972); Wright, \nMiller & Kane \u00a7 2732.2. In general, trial courts should proceed with \u201ccaution\u201d in as-\nsessing summary judgment and \u201cmay \u2026 deny summary judgment in a case where \nthere is reason to believe that the better course would be to proceed to a full trial.\u201d \nAnderson , 477 U.S. at 255; see also Wright, Miller & Kane \u00a7 2728. Here, \u201ca fuller record \nis necessary \u2026 to decide properly the issues involved.\u201d Wright, Miller & Kane \u00a7 2732.2. \n2. The record is underdeveloped.  Brathwaite\u2019s evidence does not show the absence \nof a genuine dispute. Start with the Statements of Undisputed Facts. Brathwaite\u2019s \nversion says he \u201c testified that he was not present for his classification hearings during \nhis time in the SHU.\u201d D.I. 273-1 \u00b6 12 (emphasis added). Defendants denied that ac-\ncount \u201cas stated,\u201d adding that \u201cBrathwaite also testified that he could have spoken to \nDefendant Kemp about his classification on or around September 27, 2010.\u201d D.I. 278-1 \n\u00b6 12. So what Brathwaite said might be undisputed, but not necessarily what happened. \nBrathwaite\u2019s deposition adds to the uncertainty. For one thing, Brathwaite did \nnot claim outright that he was never present for reclassification hearings. Rather, he \nsaid that he did not \u201c recall being present for any of these classification hearings.\u201d \nD.I. 273-2, at 67:4\u20139 (emphasis added). Similarly, a question during his deposition \nreferred to a document that said, \u201cSaw inmate on tier to perform classification MDT  \n36 with Lieutenant Savage.\u201d Id. at 92:17\u201321. When asked whether he recalled that meet-\ning, Brathwaite said, \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Id. at 92:22\u201323. \nIn another exchange, a question involved a document \u201cclaiming that [Brathwaite] \n[was] always present at [his] classification.\u201d Id. at 99:3\u201315. Brathwaite said, \u201cNo, \nthat\u2019s not true.\u201d Id. at 99:16. But when pressed about whether Brathwaite\u2019s counselor \n\u201ccame up to [his] cell \u2026 and talked to [him] about classification,\u201d he relented: \u201cIt could \nbe.\u201d Id. at 99:17\u201320. True, this latter example was about Brathwaite\u2019s 2010 review, \nwhich took place after he filed his complaint. But it at least creates uncertainty about \nwhether previous reviews were also conducted in person at Brathwaite\u2019s cell. Making \nmatters even more uncertain, neither document was included as an exhibit to the \nparties\u2019 summary-judgment motions. So I am left in doubt. \nThus, Brathwaite\u2019s evidence, on its own, did not shift the burden to defendants. \nAnd even if it did, other parts of the record also create uncertainty. \nDefendants\u2019 testimony contends that officials generally followed procedure. See, \ne.g., D.I. 273-6, at 15:9\u201312 (\u201c[T]he warden made sure that the counselors would have \nface-to-face meetings with the inmates regarding their classification \u2026 when deci-\nsions were being made.\u201d); D.I. 273-9, at 13:10\u201316 (\u201cQ. Were inmates ever present dur-\ning the classification process? A. When we did the classification, yes. Q. Where did \nthose classifications take place? \u2026 Outside their cell? A. Outside the cell.\u201d); D.I. 273-\n10, at 19:1\u201314 (similar, referring to reviews \u201con the tier\u201d); D.I. 273-9, at 25:21\u201323 \n(\u201cQ. Okay. So you would talk to an inmate before their classification hearing. Is that \ncorrect? A. Yes.\u201d); D.I. 273-10, at 17:13\u201322 (\u201cQ. \u2026 Were inmates present for their  \n37 housing classification hearings? A. Yes. Q. Were they permitted to participate in the \nclassification hearing? A. Yes.\u201d). \nAnd one isolated statement even suggests that they followed some of the proce-\ndures in Brathwaite\u2019s case specifically. D.I. 273-9, at 24:20\u201324 (Defendant Kemp \n\u201cs[aw] [Brathwaite] several times prior to classification to talk to him about his up-\ncoming classification\u201d). \nPlus, there are suggestions of a sort of informal appeals process, perhaps offering \na partial opportunity to be heard. See, e.g., D.I. 273-6, at 14\u201319; id. at 53:14\u201319 (\u201cThey \ncould write a letter to the warden or \u2026 some sort of a document where they could \nindicate that they wanted to appeal.\u201d); id. at 55:12\u201315 (\u201cSo although an inmate may \nnot be permitted to appeal officially, they\u2019re already making a sound, we would look \ninto it, and sometimes changes were made.\u201d). \nIn looking at the whole record, the truth is less than clear. \u201cOne comes away from \nthese depositions with nagging skepticism about whether there is anything \n[Brathwaite] could ever do to be released from Ad[ministrative] Seg[regation].\u201d Proc-\ntor v. LeClaire , 846 F.3d 597, 613 (2d Cir. 2017). But that sense does not put the issue \nbeyond dispute. So a question remains for trial: What process did Brathwaite get? \nV. INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY  \nBrathwaite alleges that his clearly established right was violated. But that pas-\nsive sentence must become an active one: Brathwaite must show defendants\u2019 personal \ninvolvement in the violations. And to recover for the alleged 2007 violation, he must \nshow that he is entitled to tolling.  \n38 A. Active involvement \nAs noted many pages ago now, I must \u201canalyze separately\u201d each defendant\u2019s con-\nduct. Grant, 98 F.3d at 126. That requirement flows from \u00a7 1983\u2019s tort-law roots. An \n\u201cessential element\u201d of a \u201ccause of action for \u2026 tort[] is that there be some reasonable \nconnection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damage which the \nplaintiff has suffered.\u201d Jutrowski v. Township of Riverdale , 904 F.3d 280, 289\u201390 (3d \nCir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). Building on that common-law founda-\ntion, the Supreme Court has required a showing of \u201cdirect responsibility.\u201d Rizzo v. \nGoode, 423 U.S. 362, 376\u201377 (1976). In other words, the defendant\u2019s individual con-\nduct must have played an \u201caffirmative part\u201d in the violation. Id. \nA question about \u201cthe extent of each officer\u2019s participation \u2026 is a classic factual \ndispute to be resolved by the fact finder.\u201d Jutrowski , 904 F.3d at 291 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted, alterations adopted). But that extent inquiry is distinct from a \n\u201cdispute about the possibility of each officer\u2019s participation.\u201d Id. So to survive sum-\nmary judgment, there must be a genuine dispute over the officer\u2019s \u201creasonable con-\nnection\u201d to the violation. Id. at 289. \nFew solitary-confinement due-process cases reach this stage. No Third Circuit \ncase addresses what \u201cpersonal involvement\u201d means in this context. But other circuits \nhave held liable those defendants who conducted deficient classification reviews or \nrecommended that a prisoner stay in solitary. See Hobbs, 662 F.3d at 1006; Williamson \nv. Stirling , 912 F.3d 154, 171\u201372 (4th Cir. 2018). The circuits have also held that mul-\ntiple layers of review do not shield decisionmakers along the chain. See Hanrahan v. \nDoling, 331 F.3d 93, 97 n.4 (2d Cir. 2003); cf.  Williamson , 912 F.3d at 172 n.14.  \n39 B. Individual assessments \nNow consider the remaining defendants: Kemp, Savage, Scarborough, Phelps, and \nPierce. All five had at least a reasonable connection to Brathwaite\u2019s confinement. \nKemp\u2019s and Savage\u2019s roles in 2008 and 2009 are simple: they constituted the two-\nmember multidisciplinary team for those reviews, and they both recommended con-\ntinued confinement. See 273-3, at 4, 10. Kemp was also part of the multidisciplinary \nteam in 2007. Id. at 14. Savage\u2019s involvement in 2007 is less clear. But he was a \nclassifications officer by that time, making housing decisions and working with \nKemp. See D.I. 273-10, at 10:24\u201311:3, 12:6\u201318, 16:2\u201324. So there is at least a triable \nissue on the extent of his involvement in Brathwaite\u2019s 2007 review. \nDirect involvement of Scarborough, Phelps, and Pierce is less straightforward. But \nBrathwaite has at least raised a genuine dispute about it. He says that all three had \na hand in creating, maintaining, or using the remain-in-SHU list. Scarborough testi-\nfied that he put inmates\u2019 names on the list. D.I. 273-6, at 68:5\u201370:6. Pierce testified \nthat those in positions of authority, like himself, reviewed the list and could make \nrecommendations about who to add or remove. D.I. 273-13, at 62:14\u201363:10. And \nthough Phelps denies having any memory of the list, other defendants\u2019 testimony \nsuggests that the \u201cwarden made the decision as to names going on and coming off the \nlist.\u201d Compare D.I. 273-13, at 54:21\u201323, with D.I. 273-14, at 51:21\u201353:3. See also  \nD.I. 273-10, at 62:7\u20139. And the 2007, 2008, and 2009 review forms all identify the \nremain-in-SHU list as a justification. So this theory is sufficient. \nAll three were involved in other ways too. Scarborough oversaw classifications from \n2004 to 2010. D.I. 273-6, at 10:9\u201316:1. Pierce testified that part of his job was to  \n40 \u201c[e]nsur[e] that the [classification-review] process got done.\u201d D.I. 273-13, at 45:22\u2013\n46:17. He also dealt with prisoner complaints and, at times, stood in for the warden. \nD.I. 273-13, at 48:9\u201349:12. Phelps, as warden, had a veto over every classification de-\ncision and reviewed them extensively. D.I. 273-14, at 40:19\u201341:24, 85:1\u201387:5, 93:4\u201310. \nBut Phelps and Pierce were not involved with the remain-in-SHU list or classifi-\ncations generally until they became warden and deputy warden in 2008. And \nBrathwaite has not connected their pre-2008 roles to his classification reviews. \nSo a genuine dispute remains about the extent of involvement in the alleged 2008 \nand 2009 violations for all five defendants. As for the 2007 violation, only the claims \nagainst Kemp, Savage, and Scarborough survive\u2014if the 2007 claim overcomes the \nstatute of limitations. \nC. There is a genuine dispute over whether to toll the limitations period \nfor the 2007 claim \nThe parties agree that Delaware\u2019s two-year statute of limitations for personal-\ninjury torts applies. D.I. 279, at 2. Brathwaite filed his complaint in 2010. So if \nBrathwaite\u2019s claim accrued in 2007, it would be untimely unless I toll the statute of \nlimitations. Brathwaite argues both that his claim accrued later and that the limita-\ntions period should be tolled. \nI previously held that each of Brathwaite\u2019s claims accrued \u201cwhen [he] knew or \nshould have known of the injury upon which the action is based.\u201d D.I. 235, at 5\u20136 (quot-\ning Sameric Corp. of Del., Inc. v. City of Philadelphia , 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998)). \nAs for tolling, I apply Delaware law. See Wallace v. Kato , 549 U.S. 384, 394 (2007). \nBrathwaite claims two grounds for tolling: equitable tolling and fraudulent  \n41 concealment. D.I. 279, at 2\u20133; see AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Lebanon Cnty. Emps.\u2019 \nRet. Fund, 243 A.3d 417, 430 (Del. 2020). Equitable tolling is warranted if Brathwaite \n\u201cwas prevented in some extraordinary manner from timely asserting his rights.\u201d Ow-\nens v. Carman Ford, Inc. , 2013 WL 5496821, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 20, 2013) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). And fraudulent concealment involves defendants\u2019 \n(1) preventing Brathwaite from learning material facts or (2) misleading him. In re \nTyson Foods, Inc. Consol. S\u2019holders Litig. , 919 A.2d 563, 585 (Del. Ch. 2007).  \nBrathwaite has not justified equitable tolling. For this argument, he points to his \nsolitary confinement and that he was reasonably diligent in writing letters. But he \nfails to explain how his confinement prevented him from asserting his rights \u201cin some \nextraordinary manner.\u201d Rather, as defendants point out, Brathwaite was a repeat \nlitigant between 2004 and 2010. D.I. 281, at 7 (collecting cases). So he has not justi-\nfied equitable tolling. \nBut a genuine dispute underlies his other arguments. Brathwaite makes both a \ndelayed-accrual and a fraudulent-concealment argument. Here, they boil down to the \nsame thing: he says he should not have known of his injury by 2007 (so I should delay \naccrual) because defendants hid material facts from him (so I should toll for fraudu-\nlent concealment). He says prison officials told him that he would be moved out of \nsolitary once his risk-assessment score was low enough. D.I. 279, at 6. Not until 2008, \nhe says, did he have a reason to believe that was false. Id. Only then did he find out \nabout the remain-in-SHU list. Id. Given that he allegedly \u201cdid not receive notices\u201d or  \n42 \u201cget to see anything\u201d about his reviews, defendants \u201ckept [him] in the dark regarding \nthe timing and occurrence of required annual reviews.\u201d Id. at 6\u20137. \nBrathwaite has a point, but his framing is off. He says I should toll the limitations \nperiod because he did not know of any \u201csystematic procedural irregularity\u201d in his \nclassification reviews until 2008. D.I. 279, at 7 (quoting Bowen v. New York , 476 U.S. \n467, 480\u201381 (1986)). But this is not a pattern-or-practice case; Brathwaite did not \nneed to know about systematic irregularity. Instead, the upshot of his allegations is \nthat he might have had good reason not to know (or defendants might have misrep-\nresented) that his confinement was indefinite. As we have seen, indefiniteness is a \nmaterial fact for his claim. So he has raised a genuine dispute about whether he \nshould have known (or defendants concealed or misled him about) this material fact. \n* * * * * \nBrathwaite was held in solitary confinement for years on end. Prison officials can \ndo that. But the Constitution requires that they give the prisoner a chance to per-\nsuade them otherwise. Brathwaite says they did not give him that chance. Because \nit was clearly established that officials had to do so, we will go to trial.  \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nKEVIN C.
