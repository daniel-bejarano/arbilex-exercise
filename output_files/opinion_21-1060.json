D.I. 564) with respect to cross-motions for summary \njudgment that disposed of some but not all claims asserted in two adversary \nproceedings: the so-called \"Estate Action\" (Adv. Proc. No. 13-50530-CSS) and the \nso-called \"Lender Action\" (Adv. Proc. No. 14-50971-CSS). The Order directed \nthe parties to submit a proposed judgment reflecting the Bankruptcy Court's \nrulings. On June 23, 2021, following briefing by the parties, the Bankruptcy Court \nentered a $130 million judgment (Adv. D.I. 579) (\"Judgment\") on certain claims in \nfavor of plaintiff Catherine Youngman, as Litigation Trustee for ASHINC \nCorporation and its affiliated Debtors (\"Trustee\"), and against defendants Yucaipa \nAmerican Alliance Fund I, L.P., and Yucaipa American Alliance (Parallel) Fund I, \nL.P. (\"Yucaipa\"). \nCurrently before the Court are the Bankruptcy Court's proposed findings of \nfact and conclusions of law (\"FFCL\") pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy \n1 Unless otherwise noted, \"Adv. D.I. _\" shall refer to the docket of the Lender \nAction, Adv. Proc. No. 14-50971-CSS. The docket of the Chapter 11 cases is cited \nas \"B.D.I. _.\" Capitalized terms not otherwise defined shall have the meanings \nascribed to them in the Opinion. Procedure 7052 and 90332 as they were issued solely with respect to the \nBankruptcy Court's granting of summary judgment in favor of the Trustee and \nagainst Yucaipa in the Lender Action with respect to the Trustee's non-core breach \nof contract claim referred to in these proceedings as \"Lender Claim 2.\" \nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Court sustains in part Yucaipa's \nObjections to the Opinion and Order and adopts the remaining proposed FFCL \nsubmitted by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to Lender Claim 2. \nII. RELEVANT BACKGROUND3 \nThis dispute arose in the Chapter 11 cases of Allied Systems Holdings, Inc., \nwhich sought bankruptcy protection on May 17, 2012. Over the past 8\u00bd years, the \nHonorable Christopher S. Sontchi has presided over the Chapter 11 cases, \nincluding the long and contentious history of litigation in two adversary \nproceedings brought against Yucaipa concerning the First Lien Credit Agreement \n(\"FLCA\") and multiple amendments thereto. \n2 The Opinion and Order constituted the Bankruptcy Court's findings of fact and \nconclusions of law as required by Bankruptcy Rule 7052. Bankruptcy Rule 9033 \nprovides that, in any proceeding in which the Bankruptcy Court has issued \nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, this Court shall review de novo \n\"any portion of the bankruptcy judge's findings of fact or conclusions of law to \nwhich specific written objection has been made ... \" FED. R. BANKR. P. 9033. \n3 As it is written primarily for the parties, this Memorandum Opinion sets forth \nonly the procedural background relevant to this proceeding. \n2 The Estate Action, filed on February 1, 2013 by the Official Committee of \nUnsecured Creditors (the \"Committee\"), asserts claims for (i) equitable \nsubordination, (ii) recharacterization, (iii) breach of contract, (iv) specific \nperformance, and recovery of avoidable transfers, and (v) disallowance of certain \nclaims. \nThe Lender Action, filed on November 19, 2014, by BDCM Opportunity \nFund II, LP, Black Diamond CLO 2005-1 Ltd. (collectively, \"Black Diamond\"), \nand Spectrum Investment Partners, L.P. (\"Spectrum,\" and together with Black \nDiamond, \"BD/S\"), asserts claims for (i) equitable subordination, (ii) breach of \ncontract, (iii) breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and (iv) \ntortious interference with contract. With respect to the breach of contact claim at \nissue here-Lender Claim 2-the complaint in the Lender Action alleges that \nYucaipa breached the FLCA by (i) acquiring more first lien debt from Com Vest in \nAugust 2009 than permitted under the Third Amendment (Adv. D.I. 1 ,I,I 117-120; \n123(a)); (ii) declaring itself to be the Requisite Lender as a result of an \nimpermissible acquisition of First Lien Debt (id. ,I 121; see also id. ,I 123(b)); (iii) \nbreaching the Third Amendment's provisions related to voting rights \"by \nimproperly acting as Requisite Lender\" (id. ,I 122); (iv) using its status as Requisite \nLender \"to neutralize the First Lien Lenders, giving the debtors a 'free pass' to \nignore\" the FLCA' s provisions, and to protect its equity investment by precluding \n3 a restructuring of Allied (id ,r 123(cHd)); and (v) violating the Third \nAmendment's Capital Contribution Provision by not making a capital contribution \nof at least 50% of the aggregate principal of the Term Loans that Yucaipa acquired \nfrom Com Vest on August 21, 2009, within 10 days of acquiring that debt (id. ,r,r 54 \n(second bullet), 101 ). \nIn 2020, the Trustee and Yucaipa each moved for summary judgment on \ncertain of the Trustee's claims. On May 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued the \nOpinion and Order. As both parties had moved the Bankruptcy Court for \naffirmative relief, the Order included language indicating that the claims at issue \nconstituted a \"'core proceeding' pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)\" and that the \nBankruptcy Court had \"judicial power to enter a final order.\" With respect to \nLender Claim 2, the Bankruptcy Court rejected Yucaipa's argument that this claim \nwas barred by Delaware's 3-year statute of limitations and further determined that \nthe Trustee had carried her burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact regarding the elements of breach of contract under New York law. 4 \nThe Order directed the parties to submit a proposed judgment reflecting the various \nrulings in the Opinion and Order. \n4 The Bankruptcy Court previously held that the Delaware statute of limitations \napplies as it related to the FLCA and its various amendments. (See B.D.I. 1068 \n(\"2/27/13 Hearing Tr.\") at 108:1-17 (hearing on the motion to dismiss Yucaipa's \ncross-claims)). \n4 Prior to submission of the proposed judgment, however, Yucaipa filed its \nRule 9033 Objection (D.1. 1-2) (\"9033 Objection\") along with an objection to the \nentry of judgment (Estate Action, Adv. D.I. 830) (\"Proposed Judgment \nObjections\") asserting, inter alia, that the Bankruptcy Court lacked authority to \nenter a final judgment on non-core claims in both the Estate Action and Lender \nAction -specifically, Lender Claim 2 and Estate Claim 5. 5 The Bankruptcy Court \nsubsequently advanced questions to the Trustee regarding: (i) whether Yucaipa \nconsented to the Court exercising jurisdiction to issue final orders and judgments \non non-core claims through its conduct, and (ii) whether the Bankruptcy Court can \nprovide findings of fact on summary judgment where the Court ruled as a matter \nof law, in whole or in part, in favor of the Trustee on certain claims including \nLender Claim 2. On June 22, 2021, the Trustee filed her responses to the \nObjections (D.1. 1-3) (\"9033 Response\"), which also responded to specific \nquestions that the Bankruptcy Court posed regarding its ability to enter a final \norder with respect to the non-core Estate Claim 5 based on Yucaipa's waiver, \nalong with an amended proposed form of Judgment (Adv. D.I. 575-1). The \nTrustee conceded in her 903 3 Response that Lender Claim 2 was a non-core claim, \nas previously determined by the Bankruptcy Court (see Adv. D.I. 70), and that \n5 Yucaipa's Objections do not contest the Court's jurisdiction to enter final orders \nor judgment where summary judgment was granted in its favor. \n5 Yucaipa had not consented to entry of a final order by the Bankruptcy Court on \nthat claim. (See Response, D.I. 1-3 at 5). The Trustee requested that the \nBankruptcy Court issue clarifications that: (i) \"the rulings on [Lender Claim 2] are \nentered as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,\" and similarly (ii) \"if \nit is later determined that this Court somehow lacked jurisdiction to enter final \norders and judgments on Estate Claim 5, that the Opinion should be construed as \nproposed findings and conclusions.\" (Id. at 2-3 & 5 n.8).6 \nOn June 22, 2021, Yucaipa filed its reply (D.1. 1-4) (\"9033 Reply\"), in \nwhich it also responded to the specific questions posed by the Bankruptcy Court \nand took the position that it had properly contested the Bankruptcy Court's \nauthority to enter a final order with respect to both Lender Claim 2 and Estate \nClaim 5. (D.1. 1-4 at 4). On June 23, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered the \nJudgment on various claims, including Estate Claim 5, but it did not enter \nJudgment on Lender Claim 2 or issue any clarifications. \nOn July 23, 2021, Yucaipa filed a Notice of Completion of Briefing, \nindicating that briefing on its 9033 Objections was complete and \"request[ing] \ntransmittal to the District Court\" for de novo review solely with respect to \"that \n6 Because this Court's standard of review is de novo, any error in this regard is \nharmless. See Exec. Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkinson, 573 U.S. 25, 39-40 (2014) \n(District Court's de novo review of the Bankruptcy Court's order granting \nsummary judgment and entry of its own judgment cured any error in the \nBankruptcy Court's earlier entry of judgment). \n6 portion of the Order contained in the first Paragraph 2 thereof granting summary \njudgment in favor of the Plaintiff [Trustee] and against Defendants [Yucaipa] ... \non the non-core \"Lender Claim 2 (Breach of Contract).\" (D.I. 1-6) (emphasis \nadded). Yucaipa has appealed other determinations made in the Opinion, Order, \nand Judgment, which appeals are pending before the Court in separate proceedings. \nSee Civ. No. 21-994-CFC, 21-995-CFC. \nIII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW \nThe Court has jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334. Solely \nbefore the Court is the Bankruptcy Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of \nthe Trustee on the breach of contract claim asserted in Lender Claim 2, which is a \nfinal order. With respect to a matter that is not a core proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 157(b)(2) but is nonetheless related to a case under title 11, the bankruptcy court \nshall submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court. \nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(l). Here, the Bankruptcy Court noted that the Opinion \n\"constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal \nRule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052.\" (Opinion at 2 n.l). Following submission, \n\"any final order or judgment shall be entered by the district court judge after \nconsidering the bankruptcy judge's proposed findings and conclusions and after \nreviewing de novo those matters to which any party has timely and specifically \n7 objected.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157( c )(1 ). With respect to the standard of review, the \nFederal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure further instruct: \nThe district judge shall make a de novo review upon the record or, after \nadditional evidence, of any portion of the bankruptcy judge's findings of fact \nor conclusions of law to which specific written objection has been made in \naccordance with this rule. The district judge may accept, reject, or modify \nthe proposed findings of fact or conclusions of law, receive further evidence, \nor recommit the matter to the bankruptcy judge with instructions that \"[t]he \ndistrict judge may accept, reject or modify the proposed findings of fact or \nconclusions of law, receive further evidence, or recommit the matter to the \nbankruptcy judge with instructions. \nFED. R. BANKR. P. 9033(d). \"In conducting a de novo review, the Court must \nconsider all of the Bankruptcy Court's findings and conclusions and afford them \nno presumption of validity.\" In re Montgomery Ward & Co., 2004 WL 323095, at \n*1 (D. Del. Feb. 13, 2004), rev'd on other grounds, 428 F.3d 154 (3d Cir. 2005). \nPursuant to Rule 56, a court \"shall grant summary judgment if the movant \nshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986) (\"Under Rule 56(c), summary judgment is \nproper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on \nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to \nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\"). If the moving party has carried its burden, the nonmovant must then \"come \nforward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" \n8 Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 415 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must \"do \nmore than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material \nfacts.\" Matsushita, 4 75 U.S. at 586-87; see also Podohnik v. U.S. Postal Service, \n409 F.3d 584, 594 (3d Cir. 2005) (stating party opposing summary judgment \"must \npresent more than just bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions to show \nexistence of a genuine issue\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the \n\"mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat \nan otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment,\" a factual dispute \nis genuine where \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict \nfor the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 411 U.S. 242, 247-48 \n(1986). Finally, under the summary judgment standard, the Bankruptcy Court was \nrequired to \"draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it \nmay not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\" Reeves v. \nSanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). \nIV. ANALYSIS \nYucaipa identifies five specific objections to the Bankruptcy Court's \nOpinion and Order (\"Objections A-E\"). (See D.I. 1-2 at 9-14). As Yucaipa \nexplains, \"[t]he focus of these objections is on the Bankruptcy Court's resolution \n9 of the non-core claims for breach of contract; Yucaipa will present its grounds for \nreversal as to the other claims in its appeal from the judgment, once entered.\" (Id. \nat 9). The Court reviews de novo each of the specific objections below. \nA. Obiection A: Opinion at 6 \nYucaipa objects to the discussion of jurisdiction at page 6 of the Opinion, \nwhich states: \"This Court has jurisdiction over this matter, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1334. This is a core proceeding, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b).\" (Opinion at 6). \nYucaipa argues that Lender Claim 2 is a quintessentially non-core claim as to \nwhich the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final order. (D.I. 1-2 at \n9). \nIt is not disputed that Lender Claim 2 is a non-core claim. The Bankruptcy \nCourt has previously determined as much, and the Trustee concedes. I therefore \nagree with Yucaipa that is it appropriate at this juncture to review de novo any \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the Bankruptcy Court's grant of \nsummary judgment in favor or the Trustee on the breach of contract claim asserted \nin Lender Claim 2. \nB. Obiection B: Opinion at 6-22 \n1. Objection to factual history \nYucaipa objects to the Bankruptcy Court's factual findings in the Opinion, \nincluding the \"Factual History\" set forth in pages 6-22. (D.I. 1-2 at 10-12). \n10 Yucaipa argues that the Bankruptcy Court made findings of fact in \"violat[ion of] \nthe fundamental standards that are supposed to guide courts' resolution of \nsummary judgment motions.\" (Id. at 10). According to Yucaipa, the Bankruptcy \nCourt \"resolved genuine issues of material fact, ignored or mischaracterized \nevidence, failed to construe the evidence in a light most favorable to the non\u00ad\nmoving party (Yucaipa), drew inferences against the non-moving party (Yucaipa), \nand in some instances allowed the Trustee to rely on noting more than \nspeculation.\" (Id.) \nThe Bankruptcy Court expressed its disagreement with this argument during \nthe hearing on Yucaipa's motion for stay pending appeal held on July 6, 2021. \n(See Estate Action, Adv. D.I. 864 (\"7/6/21 Hearing Tr.\") at 31 :21-32:3 (\"[T]there \nwas no fact finding. There's no violation of the summary judgment rules. Every \nfact that is the underpinning of the judgment was undisputed or, to the extent there \nwas a dispute as to what it might have meant if you had applied parol[ e] evidence, \nit was irrelevant because it was based solely on the plain meaning of the \ndocuments. Plain meaning of documents is not a fact-finding exercised by the \nCourt that could somehow be disputed.\"). \nThe Bankruptcy Court recommended that this Court enter summary \njudgment in the Trustee's favor on Lender Claim 2 under Rule 56. Rule 56 \nrequires that \"[t]he court should state on the record the reasons for granting or \n11 denying the motion.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The Trustee argues, under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(3)-made applicable to adversary proceedings \nunder Bankruptcy Rule 7052 -the Bankruptcy Court \"is not required to state \nfindings or conclusions when ruling a motion under Rule 12 or 56.\" Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 52(a)(3). The Trustee argues that Rule 52(a)(3) is stated permissively, leaving it \n\"totally within the discretion of bankruptcy judges as to whether they wish to make \nany specific findings of fact and/or conclusions of law\" in connection with \ndeciding a motion for summary judgment. Barone v. Strouse, Greenberg Mortg. \nCo., 71 B.R. 521,524 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1987).7 \nAssuming that is true with respect to entry of summary judgment on a core \nmatter, it is undisputed that the breach of contract claim at issue here-Lender \nClaim 2-is a non-core claim, and therefore, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(l), any final \njudgment on that claim required not only a statement of \"reasons for granting or \ndenying the [Trustee's summary judgment] motion\" under Rule 56, but also \n1 See also Leibowitz v. Kalamata Capital Grp. LLC, 625 B.R. 390, 398 n.5 (N.D. \nIll. 2021) (\"[T]he court is not stating findings of fact or conclusions of law because \nCivil Rule 52(a)(3), made applicable by Bankruptcy Rule 7052, does not so require \nwhen ruling on a motion for summary judgment ... [T]his Memorandum Decision \nconstitutes the court's statement on the record for granting or denying the \nMotions.\"); Devices Liquidation Tr. v. KMT Wireless, LLC, 588 B.R. 661,662 \n(Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2018) (\"The Court is not stating findings of facts and \nconclusions of law as [Bankruptcy Rule] 7052 ... does not so require in ruling on \na motion for summary judgment.\"); Sheet Metal Workers Nat'/ Pension Fund v. \nKern, 542 B.R. 87, 90 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2017) (same). \n12 submission of \"proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law\" sufficient to \nsupport its holding- i.e.,, in the summary judgment context, the undisputed facts \nthat warrant judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party. \nNotwithstanding Yucaipa's objection, the Bankruptcy Court's careful \nOpinion meets these requirements. (See Opinion at 2 n.1 ( stating \"This Opinion \nconstitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal \nRule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052.\")) As discussed below, having reviewed de \nnovo the matters raised in Yucaipa's 9033 Objections with respect to Lender Claim \n2, I find that the Bankruptcy Court correctly applied the summary judgment \nstandard, relying on undisputed facts or the plain meaning of documents, in finding \nthat the Trustee carried her initial burden in \"establishing the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact\" regarding the elements of breach of contract under New \nYork law, Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, and that Yucaipa failed to produce \"evidence \nin the record creating a genuine issue of material fact\" as to those same elements. 8 \n8 Because review of the proposed FFCL is de novo, I need not address whether \nYucaipa otherwise consented to the Bankruptcy Court's authority to enter a final \norder on Lender Claim 2. (See D.I. 1-2 at 3-4). \n13 2. Objections to specific factual findings \nIn its 9033 Objections, Yucaipa cites three examples of the Bankruptcy \nCourt's purported misapplication of the summary judgment standard (D.1. 1-2 at \n10-12).9 \nFirst, Yucaipa objects to the finding contained in the Opinion that \"[f]rom \nlate 2011 through Spring 2012, Yucaipa demanded a premium price of $1.15 for \neach dollar of its First Lien Debt, based on the premise that it was Requisite \nLender.\" (Opinion at 19 n.26) (emphasis added). Yucaipa contends that the \nquestion of whether Yucaipa demanded a \"premium\" in those negotiations was \n\"heavily disputed.\" (D.I. 1-2 at 10-11). Yucaipa argues that its summary \njudgment opposition brief demonstrated, with supporting evidence, that \"Yucaipa \nagreed to ratable treatment, but then BD/S walked away from the deal and filed the \ninvoluntary bankruptcy instead.\" (Id. at 10-11 ). Yucaipa cites pages 24-25 of its \nsummary judgment opposition brief (Adv. D.I. 510 (\"Yucaipa Opp. Br.\")) and the \ndeclaration in support (Adv. D.I. 511) in its entirety. \n9 Yucaipa contends these examples \"are merely illustrative, not exhaustive\" and \nYucaipa purports to \"reserve its rights to challenge every erroneous factual and/or \nevidentiary ruling in the Opinion.\" (D.I. 1-2 at 10). The docket reflects that \nYucaipa has caused the proposed FOFCOL and its 9033 Objections to be \ntransmitted to this Court for de novo review, and Yucaipa had the burden of \nsubmitting \"timely and specific[]\" objections for the Court's review. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(l). The Court therefore considers only the specific objections \nasserted by Yucaipa in its 9033 Objections. \n14 The communications cited by Yucaipa did not preclude the entry of \nsummary judgment. Yucaipa cites an email dated May 16, 2012-the day before \nBD/S filed an involuntary petition against the Debtors-in which counsel for BD/S \nmemorialized the prior day's \"discussions\" between BD/S and Yucaipa concerning \nratable treatment. (See Yucaipa Opp. Br. at 24-25 (citing Adv. D.I. 464 (\"Singer \nDeel.\") at Exhs. 68, 70 at 3-4 (,r,r 4,6) (filed under seal)). Yucaipa claims that a \ndraft agreement circulated by BD/S 's counsel in the May 16, 2012 email \nmemorialized an earlier agreement to accept equal and ratable treatment. (Id. at 24 \n(citing Ex. 70)). As set forth to in the accompanying declarations, however, there \nwas no such \"agreement[] reached on these issues, in principle or otherwise.\" \n(See Adv. D.I. 801 (\"Harris Deel.\") ,r 5). As the Trustee correctly points out, the \ndocuments identified by Yucaipa in support of its contention that it agreed to \nratable treatment consist only of attorney discussions and do not demonstrate a \ngenuine issue as to the fact that Yucaipa had demanded a premium. See In re \nRevstone Indus., LLC, 2019 WL 2929328, at *4 (D. Del. 2019) aff'd 834 F. App'x \n695 (3d Cir. 2020) ( denying objection because Bankruptcy Court \"did not weigh \nany evidence or determine the truth of any matter,\" rather it \"determined that \nDefendant failed to present anything in rebuttal to the Motions other than \nconclusory, self-serving, and hedged statements unsupported by any evidence\"). \n15 Yucaipa failed to put forth concrete evidence that it offered ratable treatment to the \nLenders, thus the Trustee's evidence to the contrary stands undisputed. \nSecond, Yucaipa objects to the finding at page 30 of the Opinion that, in \nAugust 2009, Yucaipa had the option, entirely in its own discretion, to make a \nCapital Contribution either in the form of $57 million in cash or \"as an exchange \n[ofYucaipa's newly acquired Term Loans] for equity interests\" in Allied, but that \nYucaipa did neither, which constituted a breach of contract. (See Opinion at 30). \nYucaipa asserts that the Bankruptcy Court then made the \"logical\" leap-without \nciting any evidence-that in August 2009, Yucaipa indisputably would have \nelected to contribute cash. The Bankruptcy Court found \"It is illogical to think that \nYucaipa would exchange its Term Loans in favor of worthless equity in Allied.\" \n(Id.) According to Yucaipa, \"[t]his factual conclusion is not only unsupported, it is \nitself illogical\" and \"ignored Yucaipa's argument that it would have been absurd \nfor it to have agreed in August 2009 to pay $43 million to Com Vest to acquire \n$145 .1 million (principal face value) of debt, and then ten days later pay a massive \npremium of an additional $57.4 million to Allied in cash, instead of simply \nconverting half of the discounted debt to Allied equity.\" (D.I. 1-2 at 11) (citing \nYucaipa Opp. Br. at 5). In other words, Yucaipa argues, \"the Bankruptcy Court \nerroneously concluded that the only \"logical\" course for Yucaipa in August 2009 \nwould have been to pay more than double what Com Vest had paid for the same \n16 debt six months earlier, even when Allied' s outlook continued to decline in the \ninterim.\" (Id.) \nWith respect to the finding that Yucaipa had the option to contribute cash or \ndebt in August 2009, the Trustee says this line of argument misses the point, and I \nagree. Whether it would have made more sense for Yucaipa to contribute Term \nLoans or equity to Allied on August 31, 2009, has no bearing on the undisputed \nfact that \"Allied received neither.\" (Opinion at 30). The Bankruptcy Court \nmeasured the Estate's damages not by deciding that it was logical for Yucaipa to \nelect a cash contribution in August 2009, but by observing that Yucaipa can no \nlonger contribute its Term Loans. (Opinion at 32-33). Yucaipa failed to contest \nthis dispositive finding. \nWith respect to the effect ofYucaipa's failure to make a Capital \nContribution to Allied, Yucaipa argues that the Bankruptcy Court engaged in \n\"speculation about what would have happened in [a] counterfactual scenario\" in \nwhich Yucaipa made its Capital Contribution (D.1. 1-2 at 11-12) and objects to the \nBankruptcy Court's finding (Opinion at 31) that \"Allied was insolvent at the time \nof the breach\" in August 2009. On the next page of the Opinion, the Bankruptcy \nCourt concluded that Yucaipa's failure to contribute $57.4 million to Allied in \nAugust 2009 \"ensured\" Allied's second bankruptcy nearly three years later. \nAccording to Yucaipa, \"[t]here is zero evidence to support the Bankruptcy Court's \n17 speculation about what would have happened in that counterfactual scenario.\" \n(D.I. 1-2 at 11). According to Yucaipa, the evidence cited by Bankruptcy Court in \nsupport of this finding-the deposition testimony of the Trustee's damages \nexpert-\"directly contradicts the Bankruptcy Court's finding.\" (Id.) The expert \ntestified: \"I'm not going to speculate on what would have happened with that cash \nbecause there's too many ... variables.\" (Opinion at 32 n. 78). \nAs the Trustee correctly points out, however, the Opinion reflects that the \nBankruptcy Court did not engage in speculation but did the exact opposite -it \nrejected Yucaipa's expert's speculation that \"Allied would have 'burned through' \nall the money and it would add no value to Allied,\" had Yucaipa made the Capital \nContribution. (Opinion at 31-32). Refusing to engage in such speculation, the \nBankruptcy Court made the uncontroversial point that if Allied was already headed \ntoward a second bankruptcy, Yucaipa's failure to make a Capital Contribution did \nnot help Allied avoid that fate. (Id. at 32). In any event, the Bankruptcy Court's \nstatement was in the context of discussing the damages to the Estate as a result of \nYucaipa's breach of the Capital Contribution Provision. Yucaipa fails to challenge \nthe Bankruptcy Court's key holding that, under settled New York law, the full cash \nvalue of the Capital Contribution as a result ofYucaipa's breach is a stable \nfoundation to award damages given that Yucaipa admitted that it breached the \nFLCA. (See B.D.I. 4144 (\"2/4/21 Hearing Tr.\") at 59:25-60:15 (Yucaipa's \n18 Counsel: \"[I]n hindsight we know the fourth amendment was void ab initio, so \nwhen Yucaipa acquired more than the third amendment allowed, that was a breach \nof the contract. The second breach is what we call the capital contribution \nprovision ... [T] en days after acquiring term loans [Yucaipa] needs to make a \ncapital contribution; undisputed Yucaipa didn't do that. And again ... in hindsight \nwe know that that was required and it was a breach of the contract in failing to \nmake the capital contribution within ten days.\")) \nObiection C: Opinion at 26-38 \nYucaipa objects to several of the Bankruptcy Court's conclusions addressing \nthe breach of contract claim asserted in Lender Claim 2. First, Yucaipa asserts that \nthe Bankruptcy Court erred in concluding that the Litigation Trustee had \nestablished as a matter of law and undisputed fact that the Estate and Lenders \nsuffered damages resulting from Yucaipa's breach of the Capital Contribution \nProvision, and that the appropriate measure of damages was the full amount of the \nCapital Contribution. (See D.I. 1-2 at 12-13). According to Yucaipa, its summary \njudgment papers demonstrated that the Trustee had no evidence of damages \nresulting from the alleged breach, and at the very least there was a genuine dispute \nconcerning the fact and amount of any damages, which precludes summary \njudgment. (See id. (citing Adv. D.I. 454 (\"Yucaipa Opening Br.\") at 27-30; \nYucaipa Opp. Br. at 3-11; Adv. D.I. 544 (\"Yucaipa Reply Br.\") at 17-18)). \n19 Conversely, the Trustee argues there was no \"genuine dispute\" concerning \nthe fact and amount of damages for Yucaipa's breach of the Capital Contribution \nProvision. (See 9033 Objection at 12). I agree. The Bankruptcy Court correctly \napplied New York law on this issue, which places the \"burden of uncertainty\" as to \nthe amount of damages on the wrongdoer. (Opinion at 31 ). The Bankruptcy Court \nrejected Yucaipa's expert's \"speculative\" opinion that Allied \"would have 'burned \nthrough' all the money\" and accepted the reasonable estimate put forth by the \nTrustee's expert that damages are best measured by the full cash value of the \nCapital Contribution. (Id. at 30-31 ). Because Yucaipa fails to challenge the \nCourt's application of New York law, its objection must fail. See In re Green \nField Energy Servs., Inc., 610 B.R. 760, 771-72 (D. Del. 2019) (denying objection \nto proposed findings of fact because defendants \"ignore [the bankruptcy court's] \ncritical holding and have not objected to it\"), aff'd, 834 F. App'x 695 (3d Cir. \n2020). \nSecond, Yucaipa asserts that the Bankruptcy Court erred in awarding \nprejudgment interest on the contract claims. (D.1. 1-2 at 12-13). Yucaipa argues \nthat the Bankruptcy Court determined that prejudgment interest shall accrue \"from \nthe date of the breach\" of the Capital Contribution provision in August 2009. \n(Opinion at 33). In analyzing the timeliness of Lender Claim 2, Yucaipa asserts, \nthe Bankruptcy Court erroneously agreed with the Trustee that \"Yucaipa \n20 continuously breached\" the FLCA through 2013, such that it would be improper to \n\"isolate\" the August 2009 breach, and it was therefore \"impossible to determine \nthe extent of the breach\" or the damages resulting from it until the JCT 363 sale in \nDecember 2013. (D.1. 1-2 at 12 (citing Opinion at 42-45)). According to Yucaipa, \nit cannot simultaneously be true that (a) there was an actionable breach causing the \nLenders harm in August 2009 such that prejudgment interest started accruing \nimmediately at that time and (b) the August 2009 breach was not independently \nactionable because it was part of one \"continuous\" breach that did not become \nactionable until December 2013. (Id. at 12-13). \nAs the Trustee correctly points out, however, Yucaipa's argument conflates \nthe Estate's and the Lenders' breach of contract claims as well as the continuous \nbreach doctrine. The Estate's breach of contract claim is based solely on \nYucaipa's failure to make the Capital Contribution and was actionable when \nYucaipa's contribution was due-i.e., August 31, 2009. (Opinion at 32). In \ncontrast, the Court held that the Lenders' breach of contract claim is based on \nYucaipa's continuous breaches, which only became actionable upon the JCT 363 \nsale in December 2013. (Id. at 45). \nThird, Yucaipa objects to the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion that the Third \nAmendment's covenant-not-to-sue did not bar Estate Claim 5. (D.I. 1-2 at 13 \n(citing Opinion at 37-38)). The grant of summary judgment on Estate Claim 5, \n21 however, is not before the Court in this proceeding. Rather, the Bankruptcy Court \nhas entered a final Order and Judgment on Estate Claim 5, which is currently on \nappeal. (See D.I. 1-6).10 \nObiection D: Opinion at 38-46 \nDelaware Code Title 10, Section 8106 specifies a three-year limitations \nperiod for the Contract-Based Claims: \nNo action based on a statute, and no action to recover damages caused by an \ninjury unaccompanied with force or resulting indirectly from the act of the \ndefendant shall be brought after the expiration of 3 years from the accruing \nof the cause of such action. \n10 Assuming, arguendo, however, that the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion has any \nbearing on Lender Claim 2, the Court finds no error. Yucaipa argues that its \nsummary judgment papers demonstrated that the covenant-not-to-sue expressly \nbars Allied (and thus the Litigation Trustee, who now stands in Allied's shoes as to \nEstate Claim 5) from asserting claims against Yucaipa premised on any \"omission\" \nwith respect to the Capital Contribution, and the only potentially relevant omission \nin connection with the Capital Contribution was Yucaipa's failure to make it. (D.I. \n1-2 at 13 (citing Yucaipa Opening Br. at 31-35; Yucaipa Reply Br. at 18-2). \nYucaipa contends that the Bankruptcy Court improperly referred to other \nhypothetical \"omissions\" that could apply to the covenant-not-to-sue at issue in \norder to reject Yucaipa's interpretation of the provision. (See D.I. 1-2 at 13 (citing \nOpinion at 37-38 & n.96)). As the Trustee correctly points out, however, the \nBankruptcy Court's holding was that the covenant-not-to-sue clearly and \nunambiguously bars Allied from suing over an \"omission\" by Yucaipa \"only ... \nwhen Yucaipa makes a Capital Contribution of its Term Loans, which Yucaipa did \nnot do.\" (Opinion at 38 (emphasis in original)). Yucaipa does not challenge the \nBankruptcy Court's understanding of the plain meaning of this provision, on which \nits conclusions rely, and the Court finds no reason to disturb the Bankruptcy \nCourt's conclusion. See In re Green Field Energy Servs., Inc., 610 B.R. at 771-72. \n22 10 Del Code\u00a7 8106. Yucaipa objects to the Bankruptcy Court's conclusions that \nLender Claim 2 was not time-barred. (See Opinion at 38-46). According to \nYucaipa, it is undisputed that \"Delaware's three-year statute of limitations applies, \nthat Yucaipa's alleged breach of the Capital Contribution happened in August \n2009, and that the Lender Complaint was not filed until November 2014.\" (See \nD.I. 1-2 at 13 (citing Adv. D.I. 1 ,I 135)). \nIn the proceedings below, the Trustee accused Yucaipa of isolating just one \nof its breaches-its purchase of Com Vest's debt and declaration that it was \nRequisite Lender on August 21, 2009-to bar claims arising from all of its \nbreaches. Based on the \"continuous contract\" and \"continuous breach\" doctrines, \nwhich are recognized under Delaware law, the Trustee argued that the FLCA \ngranted the Lender reoccurring and continuous rights, that Yucaipa continuously \nbreached the FLCA for 4 years on the pretext that it was Requisite Lender, and that \nthe statute of limitations did not accrue until full damages were ascertainable. \nAccording to the Trustee, it was not until the JCT 363 Sale was consummated on \nDecember 27, 2013 that the cumulative effect ofYucaipa's breaches could be \ndetermined. \nAs the Bankruptcy Court correctly noted (see Opinion at 40-41 ), while a \ncause of action for breach of contract generally accrues at the time of breach, \nDelaware law recognizes exceptions for a \"continuous contract\" or a \"continuous \n23 breach.\" Under both exceptions, \"the statute begins to run only when full damages \ncan be ascertained and recovered.\" See In re Burger, 125 B.R. 894, 901-02 \n(Bankr. D. Del. 1991); Guerrieri v. Cajun Cove Condo. Council, 2001 WL \n1520039, at *6 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 25, 2007) (statute of limitations did not accrue \nuntil damages could be ascertained where contract created an ongoing and \ncontinuous duty); Smith v. Mattia, 2010 WL 412030, at *4 (Del. Ch. Feb. 1, 2010) \n(same). Determining the application of these exceptions requires an analysis of \n\"[ w ]hether the obligations under a contract are continuous or severable\" which \n\"turns on the parties' intent, which may be ascertained through the contract's terms \nand subject matter, taken together with the pertinent facts and circumstances \nsurrounding its formation.\" Smith, 2010 WL 412030, at *4; Kaplan v. Jackson, \n1994 WL 45429, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 20, 1994) (same). \nApplying this framework, the Bankruptcy Court determined that the FLCA \nand the Third Amendment was a continuing contract. Specifically, in return for \nproviding hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, the non-Yucaipa Lenders were \nentitled over time to, among other things: \nrecurring principal and interest payments; (ii) recurring financial information \nfrom the Company and reasonable access to its management; (iii) the right to \ndirect the Agent -through the Requisite Lenders -to exercise certain \nremedies in the case of an Event of Default; (iv) Capital Contributions in the \namount of 50% of Term Loans acquired by Yucaipa; (v) Yucaipa never \nserving or acting as Requisite Lender; and (vi) Yucaipa never asserting any \nclaims against them, or the Agent, in any way relating to the Credit \nAgreement or related documents. \n24 (Opinion at 42 (footnotes omitted)). Looking to \"contract's terms and subject \nmatter, taken together with the pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding its \nformation\" to determine the parties' intent, these contractual rights were designed \nto ensure the First Lien Lenders were repaid the principal amount of their loans \n(with the applicable interest) over the duration of the Credit Agreement. Thus it is \na \"continuous contract,\" and the Delaware courts hold that the statute of limitations \nfor breach of a continuous contract does not accrue until \"full damages can be \nascertained and recovered.\" Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Cap Gemini America, \nInc., 2002 WL 1042089, at *7 (Del. Super. Ct. 2002). Here, the extent of \nmonetary damages caused by Yucaipa's continuous breaches of the FLCA was not \nascertainable until December 27, 2013, when JCT purchased substantially all of \nAllied's assets for $135 million -generating only $53.8 million to Allied's First \nLien Lenders, who held about $244 million of loans. \nYucaipa asserts that the Bankruptcy Court erred in applying the \"continuous \nbreach\" doctrine, as the Third Circuit has held that the doctrine is a narrow \nexception to the statute of limitations and does not apply where, as here, the \ncomplaint alleges a discrete breach of a specific provision of a contract that was \nactionable at the moment of the breach. (D.I. 1-2. at 14). Yucaipa argues that the \nBankruptcy Court departed from binding case law in Delaware and the Third \nCircuit, misconstrued the contract, and ignored the Trustee's specific theory of \n25 breach. (See id. (citing Yucaipa Opening Br. at 19-26; Yucaipa Reply Br. at 2-17; \nEstate Action, Adv. D.I. 819; Adv. D.I. 558 (Yucaipa's supplemental post-hearing \nletter brief)). Yucaipa cites Norman v. Elkin, 961 F.3d 275, 286 (3d Cir. 2020), \nwhich, according to Yucaipa, explains that the \"continuous breach\" doctrine is a \n\"narrow\" exception to the statute of limitations that applies \"only in unusual \ncircumstances.\" Id. at 286. \nIn Norman, majority shareholder Elkin and minority shareholder Norman \nfounded a company (\"USM\") for the purpose of acquiring certain FCC licenses. \nElkin later caused USM to enter into a Shareholder Loan Agreement (\"SLA\") \npursuant to which \"USM agreed to treat any amount Elkin contributed above his \ncapital requirement as a loan.\" Id. at 279. Elkin neither informed Norman about \nthe SLA nor sought his approval for it, and purportedly lent USM in excess of \n$600,000. Id. Thereafter, Elkin caused USM to sell certain licenses, and in a \nseries of distributions effectuated by Elkin from 2000 to 2002, USM paid Elkin \n$615,026 from the proceeds of the license sales. Norman received nothing and \neventually brought an action against Elkin. Following years of litigation, \nNorman's continuous breach argument was rejected. \nOn appeal, the Third Circuit noted that, under Delaware law, the continuing \nbreach doctrine is narrow and typically is applied only in \"unusual situations.\" Id. \nat 286. Norman's breach of contract claim did not present such an \"unusual \n26 situation,\" as each individual distribution Elkin made to himself constituted, at \nleast in theory, a discrete and readily determinable violation of Norman's rights as \na 25% equity-holder. Id. at 286. The Court rejected Norman's contention that he \nhad asserted an overarching and continuous breach because his damages from each \nindividual distribution were \"inherent[ly] contingen[t]\" on the SLA being \ninvalidated and could not be calculated until that time. The Court found that the \nSLA' s validity and Elkin' s purported failure to make proper distributions were \nadjudicated simultaneously, as the question of the SLA's validity arose in \nconnection with Elkin's defense to Norman's breach of contract claim-not as a \ncondition precedent to the claim. The Court therefore rejected what it described as \n\"Norman's unsupported attempt to dramatically expand the 'narrow' continuous \nbreach doctrine such that it reaches defenses to claims rather than true \ncontingencies.\" Id. at 286. \nIn my view, the facts of Norman-distributions under a contested loan \nagreement-differ significantly from those at issue here. While there was a \ndiscrete and readily determinable breach here, that breach led to an unforeseeable \nchain of events and with serious consequences for the Debtor and damages that \ncould not have been known ( or sought) at the time of the breach, and, which in my \nview, constitute unusual circumstances under Norman. The initial breach-the \npurchase of Com Vest's debt in 2009-was just an initial trigger which enabled \n27 Yucaipa to continuously breach the FLCA in various ways, including by (i) \ncausing Allied to cease making principal or interest payments from that point \nonward; (ii) blocking Lenders from the Company's financial information and \naccess to management; (iii) preventing any restructuring dialogue among the \nLenders; (iv) preventing Lenders from exercising remedies for the Company's \nongoing Events of Defaults; (v) routinely asserting claims against the Agent and \nLenders in contravention of the express covenant not to sue; and (vi) demanding \nJCT pay Yucaipa, and no other Lender, a premium of$1.15 for each dollar of its \nFirst Lien Debt. \nAs the Trustee points out, none of these later, continuous breaches was \ncommitted by Yucaipa when it executed the void Fourth Amendment or \nproclaimed that it was the Requisite Lender in 2009. None was an effect caused by \nexecution of the Fourth Amendment or assumption of Requisite Lender status. As \npurported Requisite Lender, Yucaipa could still have (1) allowed Allied to make \nprincipal and interest payments, (2) granted Lenders access to the Company's \nfinancial information and management, (3) permitted restructuring dialogue among \nthe Lenders, ( 4) allowed Lenders to exercise remedies for Allied' s ongoing Events \nof Defaults, ( 5) not asserted claims against the Agent and Lenders in contravention \nofYucaipa's express covenant not to sue, and (6) not demanded JCT pay Yucaipa, \nand no other Lender, a premium of $1.15 for each dollar of its debt. But under \n28 these circumstances, where continuous and additional breaches were committed, \nLenders were not required to bring piecemeal litigation and it would have been \ninefficient to have done so. Rather, the \"continuous contract\" and \"continuous \nbreach\" exceptions should apply, and the statute of limitations does not begin to \nrun until their full damages could be ascertained and recovered. Here, the extent of \nmonetary damages caused by Yucaipa's continuous breaches of the First Lien \nCredit Agreement was not ascertainable until December 27, 2013, when JCT \npurchased substantially all of Allied' s assets for $13 5 million -generating only \n$53.8 million to the Company's First Lien Lenders, who held about $244 million \nofloans \nThe Bankruptcy Court was persuaded by Branin v Stein Roe Investment \nCounsel LLC, 2015 WL 4710321, at *7 (Del. Ch. July 31, 2015). In that case, the \nChancery Court held the defendant-employer was in continuous breach of an \noperating agreement by declining ( at least 5 times) to indemnify the plaintiff\u00ad\nemployee. Id. at *2. The Branin court ruled that the statute of limitations was \n\"appropriately suspended for the period during which [plaintiffs] liabilities grew,\" \nand it observed that requiring plaintiff \"to sue continually to enforce his \nindemnification right would have been inefficient.\" Id. at * 7. \nThe Bankruptcy Court was also persuaded by In re Burger, 125 B.R. 894 \n(Bankr. D. Del. 1991). In that case, the parties entered into a service contract \n29 where Burger would purchase a herd of cattle with the investor's money, manage, \nmaintain and expand the herd as well as improve the quality of the herd. Id. at \n898. The investor agreed to pay all feed and upkeep expenses while Burger would \npay over all milk revenues and any sale proceeds from bulls or cull cows. Id. The \ninvestor and Burger also executed a seven-year lease agreement, wherein the \ninvestor would pay monthly rent for keeping the herd at Burger's ranch. Id. At the \nend of the seven-year period, the investor and Burger would liquidate the herd. Id. \nIn Burger, the court held that the statute of limitations for the investor's claims \nagainst a farm manager's breach of contract did not accrue when he first allegedly \nbreached the contract (in 1981 ). Id. at 901. The court further held that there was a \ncontinuous contract for a \"fixed seven-year period where full and complete \ndamages could not be determined by either party until the end of that time.\" Id. at \n902. The Burger court stated: \nMoreover, any claim by the Investors for damages necessarily relies on the \nliquidation of the herd which, under the terms of the contract, was scheduled \nto take place on or about September 1, 1988. Furthermore, this contract was \ncontinuously acknowledged by both parties throughout the seven-year \nperiod by the various payments made between the parties. These payments \ntoll the statute because a new promise to pay is implied therefrom. \nId. In reaching its conclusion, the Bankruptcy Court considered the facts at issue \nhere and those in Burger to be remarkably similar: \nHere, the Lenders invested in Allied, pursuant to the FLCA, just as the \ncattle-investor paid for the initial herd of cattle. As part of that transaction, \nthe Lenders expected to receive financial information, interest and principal \n30 payments, among other things. If BD/S had to run into court at each and \nevery breach -it would have been impossible to adjudicate let alone assess \ndamages. Here, the Court agrees that the failure to pay the Capital \nContribution is just one of the breaches of the FLCA and the Third \nAmendment made by Yucaipa and that the parties had a continuous contract \nthat Yucaipa continuously breached. Furthermore, the Court finds that it \nwould have been impossible to determine the extent of the breach until such \ntime as the JCT 363 Sale, which determined the bulk of the damages. In \nother words, like in Burger, the full and complete damages could not be \ndetermined until the JCT 363 Sale. \n(Opinion at 45). I agree with the Bankruptcy Court's analysis and that the breach \nconsidered by the Burger court more closely matches this case than that considered \nin Norman. The Bankruptcy Court properly considered (i) the continuing nature of \nthe Lenders' rights under the FLCA; (ii) an admission by Derex Walker ( of \nYucaipa) that there had been multiple breaches of the FLCA dating back to August \n2009; (iii) the fact that the Lenders' damages were not ascertainable until \nDecember 27, 2013; and (iv) relevant case law supporting the Trustee's argument. \n(See Opinion at 41-45). The Court therefore adopts the Court's well-reasoned \nfinding that the continuous breach doctrine applies here as a matter of law. \nObjection E: Order at 2 \nYucaipa objects to the Bankruptcy Court's finding that \"this is a core \nproceeding, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 l 57(b )\" and \"this Court has the judicial power \nto enter a final order.\" (D.I. 1-2 at 14). As explained above, the Court agrees and \nhas accordingly undertaken this de novo review of the proposed FFCL relating to \n31 the Bankruptcy Court's grant of summary judgment to the Trustee on Lender \nClaim 2. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nBased on the Bankruptcy Court's own prior determination, and the parties' \napparent agreement, I do not adopt any holding in the Opinion or Order that (i) \nLender Claim 2 \"is a core proceeding, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)\" or that \nLender Claim 2 is a claim for which \"this [Bankruptcy] Court has the judicial \npower to enter a final order.\" I overrule Yucaipa's remaining Objections and adopt \nthe remaining proposed FFCL solely with respect to Lender Claim 2. \nThe Court will issue a separate Order consistent with this Memorandum \nOpinion. \n32 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nIN RE: ASHINC CORPORATION, et al., \nDebtors. \nCATHERINE E.
