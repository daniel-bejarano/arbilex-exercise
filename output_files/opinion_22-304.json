Andrews", "date": "11-14-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nROBOCAST, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nYOUTUBE, LLC and GOOGLE, LLC, \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM Civil Action No. 22-304-RGA \nBefore me is Defendants' motion to dismiss. (D.I. 11). The motion has been fully briefed \nand I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 12, 17, 18). For the reasons set forth below, \nDefendants' motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis is a patent infringement action. On March 8, 2022, Plaintiff Robocast filed its \nComplaint against Defendants Y ouTube and Google, alleging direct, indirect, and willful \ninfringement ofU.S. Patent Nos. 7,155,451 (\"the '451 patent\"), 8,606,819 (\"the '819 patent\"), and \n8,965,932 (\"the '932 patent\") (collectively, \"the asserted patents\"). (D.1. 1). The asserted patents \nrelate to methods of automating the presentation of computer content. (Id at 5). \nThe asserted patents are related. All three share a common specification, as the '819 and \n'932 patents are continuations of the '451 patent, and all three share a common priority date to a \nprovisional application filed on September 3, 1996. (Id at 4). Plaintiff filed the non-provisional \napplication that led to the '451 patent on September 1, 1998, andJhe patent\" issued December 26, \n2006. (D.1. 1-1, Ex. 1 at p. 1). Plaintiff filed a continuation application on December 21, 2005, \n__ which issued on February 24, 2015 as the '932 patent. (D.1. 1-3, Ex. 3 at p. 1). Plaintiff filed a \n1 second continuation application on April 18, 2012, whicp. issued on Dec. 10, 2013 as the '819 \npatent. (D.I. 1-2, Ex. 2 at p. 1). \nDuring prosecution of the applications leading to the '819 and '932 patents, the Examiner , \nprovisionally rejected pending claims for non-statutory dpuble patenting because the claims in \neach of the applications were not \"patentably distinct\" from claims in the other. (D.I. 12-1, Ex. 1 \nat 11, Ex. 2 at 6). The Examiner also found that all pending claims of the '819 patent were invalid \nfor obviousness-type double patenting over claims 22-54 of the '451 patent. (D.I. 12-1, Ex. 1 at \n11). Consequently, Plaintiff filed terminal disclaimers limiting the term of the '932 patent to that \nof the '819 patent and limiting the term of the '819 patent to that of the '932 and '451 patents. \n(D.I. 12-1, Ex. 3-4). The '819 and '932 patents therefore expired on the same date: September 2, \n2017. (D.I. 12 at 1). The '451 patent expired on August 9, 2020, as Plaintiff received a 1~072-day \npatent term adjustment (PTA) for that patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(b). (D.I. 1-1, Ex. 1 at p. 1). \nII. LEGALSTANDARD \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nthe Court must accept the complaint's factual allegations as true. See Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, \nbut they must provide more than labels, conclusions, or a \"formulaic recitation\" of the claim \nelements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in \nfact).\"). Moreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to \nrelief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when \n\\ \nthe complaint's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \n2 defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.'' Id. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\" ( cleaned up)). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Indirect and Willful Infringement of the '819 and '932 Patents \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for indirect and willful \ninfringement of the '819 and '932 patents because Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege knowledge of \nthe asserted patents before their expiration. (D.I. 12 at 7-8). I agree. \nIndirect infringement requires, among other things, \"knowledge of the patent in suit and \nknowledge of patent infringement.\" Cammi! USA, LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc., 575 U.S. 632, 639 \n(2015) (inducement and contributory infringement). A determination of willful infringement \nrequires a finding of \"deliberate or intentional\" infringement. SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 14 \nF.4th 1323, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The complaint must allege that the accused infringer knew of \nthe asserted patent and knowingly or intentionally infringed the patent after acquiring that \nknowledge. Eko Brands, LLC ;_ Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters., Inc., 946 F.3d 1367, 1378-79 (Fed. \nCir. 2020). With respect to both indirect and willful infringement claims, a plaintiff can meet the \nknowledge requirement by showing \"willful blindness,\" which \"requires the patentee to show not \nonly that the accused subjectively believed that there was a high risk of infringement, but also that \nthe accused took deliberate actions to avoid confirming infringement.\" Unwired Planet, LLC v. \nApple Inc., 829 F.3d 1353, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (inducement). The knowledge requirement is not \nmet if plaintiff fails to allege that defendant acquired its knowledge before the expiration date of \nthe patent. E.g., Sprint Commc'ns Co., L.P v. Atl. Broadband Fin., LLC, 2021 WL 982735, at *1 \n(D. Del. Mar. 16, 2021) (granting summary judgment of no willful infringement because plaintiff \n3 failed to \"assert that it has any evidence that [defendant] knew of any of the currently asserted \npatents before they expired.\"). \nIn its Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants had \"actual and/or constructive \nknowledge\" of all three asserted patents beginning \"no later than the 2018 to 2019 time frame\" \n(D.I. 1 at 13). According to Plaintiff, Defendants learned of the asserted patents through unrelated \nIitigation-Virentem Ventures, LLCv. YouTube, LLC, eta/., C.A. No. 1:18-cv-00917-MN (D. Del. \nJune 20, 2018)-in which Defendants \"assert[ed] and rel[ied] upon the [asserted patents] as \nallegedly being invalidating prior art in connection with efforts to defend [themselves] against \ncharges of patent infringement\" (id.). \nThe problem with Plaintiff's theory is one of timing. The theory succeeds with respect to \nthe '451 patent; Defendants do not dispute that its invalidity contentions in Virentem satisfy the \nknowledge requirement for that patent. However, whereas the '451 patent expired in 2020, the \n'819 and '932 patents expired on September 2, 2017-that is to say, those patents expired before \nthe time frame in which Defendants are alleged to have gained knowledge of them. Plaintiff has \nnot pied any specific facts suggesting that Defendants knew of the '819 and '932 patents before \nthey expired. This, Defendants argue, is fatal to Plaintiff's claims for indirect and willful \ninfringement of those patents. (D.I. 12 at 8). \nPlaintiff's response is that pre-expiration knowledge may be plausibly inferred from \nDefendants' reliance on those patents in Virentem, as \"Invalidity Contentions generally take weeks \nor months to develop, and the prior art searching and subsequent analysis often occurs long before \nthe due date.\" (D.I. 17 at 17 n.5). Although it is certainly plausible that Defendants prepared their \n4 invalidity contentions well before they first served them in 2019, 1 it is not plausible that \nDefendants' preparation preceded the lawsuit itself, which was filed on June 20, 2018-9 months \nafter the '819 and '932 patents expired. Virentem Ventures, LLC v. YouTube, LLC, et al., No. 1:18-\ncv-00917-MN (D. Del. June 20, 2018). \nNor am I convinced by Plaintiff's argument that it is plausible to infer pre-expiration \nknowledge of the '819 and '932 patents because the claimed technology had \"achieved notoriety \nin the industry\" before September of 2017. (D.I. 17 at 17). Industry notoriety can support a \nreasonable inference of knowledge of a patent. See, e.g., BioMerieux, S.A. v. Hologic, Inc., 2018 \nWL 4603267, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. 25, 2018). The question is whether Plaintiff pleads industry \nnotoriety from which one can reasonably infer Defendants' awareness of the '819 and '932 patents \nbefore they expired. I conclude that Plaintiff has not. \nContrary to Plaintiffs assertions, Defendants' use of the '819 and '93 2 patents in Virentem \ndoes not \"give[] rise to the inference that these patents were well known patents in the technology \nspace.\" (D.I. 17 at 17). \"[P]arties often rely on obscure prior art to support invalidity arguments,\" \nas Defendants note in their reply. (D.I. 18 at 2). \nI am equally unmoved by Plaintiff's argument regarding a press release issued by Microsoft \nin December of 2001 that \"confirmed that ... the technologies that would ultimately become \nRobocast's patented inventions had earned it the reputation of being a 'pioneering Web company \noffering viewing automation tools for a variety of display devices.\"' (D.1. 1 at 4). This court has \nheld that media publicity surrounding an invention does not support an allegation of pre-suit \nknowledge absent allegations \"bridging\" knowledge of the publicity with knowledge of the patent. \n1 Defendants assert, and Plaintiff does not dispute, that Defendants' initial invalidity contentions \nin that case were served on July 8, 2019. (D.1. 12 at 4). I \n5 See PPG Indus. Ohio, Inc. v. Axalta Coating Sys., LLC, 2022 WL 610740, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 26, \n2022). \u00b7 In Axalta Coating, the court held that an industry award for the plaintiff's technology was \ninadequate support of pre-suit knowledge in part because the plaintiff failed to allege that the award \n, referenced the patent or disclosed that the technology was patented. Id Here, the \"bridge\" is even \nshakier, as Microsoft's press release predated the issuance of the ~819 and '932 patents by more \nthan a decade. \nThe existence of \"prominent national litigations\" (D.I. 17 at 17 n.6) between Plaintiff and \nthird-party competitors over the'451 patent during the 2010-2012 time frame-while the '819 and \n'932 patents were pending-does not help Plaintiff either. Filing a lawsuit over a patent does not \nplausibly grant actual knowledge of that patent to an unrelated party. Chalumeau Power Sys. LLC \nv. Alcatel-Lucent, 2012 WL 6968938, at *1 (D. Del. July 18, 2012). It is even less plausible that \nlitigation over a patent would grant an unrelated party knowledge of yet-to-be-issued patents \nthrough the then-pendency of continuation applications. See iFIT Inc. v. Peloton Interactive, 2022 \nWL 609605, at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 28, 2022) \"'(\"Knowledge of a patent application alone ... is not \nenough to establish knowledge of the patent(s) that issued from that application\"). \nFor the reasons stated above, I conclude that Plaintiff has failed to adequately allege pre\u00ad\nsuit knowledge of infringement of the '819 and '932 patents. I therefore GRANT Defendants' \nmotion to dismiss Plaintiff's willful infringement and indirect infringement claims with respect to \nthose patents.' \nB. Invalidation of the '451 Patent for Obviousness-Type Double Patenting \n.. \nDefendants argue that the '451 patent is invalid for obviousness-type double patenting \nbecause its claims are not patentably distinct from those of either the '819 or '932 patents. (D.I. 12 \n\\ \n' at 11-20). A question central to the resolution of this issue-the interplay between obviousness-\n6 r type double-patenting and a patent term extension-is an open issue that is currently before the \n' Federal Circuit. In re: Cellect, LLC, Case No. 22-1293 (Fed. Cir.). Briefing appears to be complete; \nno argument date is set. It seems reasonable to expect a decision within the first half of next year. \nI therefore think it prudent to postpone the resolution of this issue until the Federal Circuit has \nspoken. \nDefendants' motion to dismiss claims involving the '451 patent because that patent is \n' \ninvalid for obviousness-type double patenting is consequently DISMISSED with leave to refile \nwith updated briefing once the Federal Circuit decides In re: Cellect. \nC. Willful Infringement of the '451 Patent \n\\ \nDefendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for willful infringement of the '451 patent. \n(D.I. 12 at 8-10). As stated above, to plead a claim of willful infringement, the complaint must \nallege that the accused infringer knew of the asserted patent and knowingly or intentionally \ninfringed the patent after acquiring that knowledge. Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez \nEnters., Inc., 946 F.3d 1367, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Defendants do not dispute Plaintiff's \nargument that Defendants' assertion of the '451 patent in Virentem granted Defendants knowledge \nof the patent. What Plaintiff disputes is the adequacy of Defendants' allegation that Defendants \nhad pre-suit knowledge of infringement. (D.I. 12 at 8-10). I conclude that Defendants' allegation \nis adequate. \nAfter the Supreme Court's decision in Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 579 U.S. 93 \n(2016), courts in this district have held that pre-suit knowledge of the asserted patent is not by \nitself sufficient to support a willful infringement claim. E.g., Valinge Innovation AB v. Halstead \nNew England Corp., 2018 WL 2411218, at *13 (D. --Del. May 29, 2018), report and \nrecommend~tion adopted, 2018 WL 11013901 (D. Del. Nov. 6, 2018). Although knowledge of \n7 the patent does not establish knowledge of infringement, knowledge of infringement may be \ninferred from \"the totality of the patentee's allegations.\" Id. \n\u00b7, \nThe totality of Plaintiffs allegations permit a plausible inference of pre-suit knowledge of \ninfringement. Plaintiff does not merely allege that the Virentem litigation granted Defendants \nknowledge of the '451 patent; Plaintiff also alleges that, by virtue of Defendants' assertion of that \npatent in Virentem, Defendants gained \"an extensive familiarity with the scope and content\" of the \n'451 patent and its claims. (D.I. 1 at 13). This court has held that the defendant's high level of \nfamiliarity with a patent is sufficient to give rise to a plausible inference of knowledge of \ninfringement. See BioMerieux, S.A. v. Hologic, Inc., 2018 WL 4603267, *5 (D. Del. Sept. 25, \n2018) (finding plausible inference of knowledge on the basis of\"defendant's years-long campaign \nbefore the European Patent Office urging authorities to revoke the European counterparts to the \ntwo U.S. patents-in-suit\"); see also Ravgen, Inc. v. Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc., 2021 WL 3526178, \nat *3 (D. Del. Aug. 11, 2021) (inferring pre-suit knowledge of infringement based in part on the \nallegation that defendant \"cited [plaintiff]' s patents against others by asserting them as prior art to \nothers' patents and making substantive arguments about them\" in unrelated proceedings). I agree \nwith Plaintiff (D~I. 17 at 15) that the inference of knowledge is at least as plausible here as it was \nin BioMerieux, where the court inferred knowledge from defendant's alleged familiarity with a \nEuropean counterpart of plaintiffs patent. 2018 WL 4603267 at *5. Here, Defendants' alleged \nfamiliarity is with the actual asserted patent. \nFor the reasons stated above, I conclude that Plaintiff has adequately alleged pre-suit \nknowledge of infringement of the '451 patent. I therefore DENY Defendants' motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs willful infringement claims with respect to that patent. \n8 D. Induced Infringement of the '451 Patent \nDefendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for induced infringement of the '451 patent. \n(D.I. 12 at 10). For an inducement claim to survive a motion to dismiss, \"a complaint must plead \n'--facts plausibly showing that the accused infringer specifically intended another party to infringe \nthe patent and knew that the other party's acts constituted infringement.\" Lifetime Indus., Inc. v. \nTrim-Lok, Inc., 869 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege the \"specific intent\" element. (D.I. 12 at 10). \n\"[S]pecific intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence where a defendant has both \nknowledge of the patent and specific intent to cause the acts constituting infringement.\" Ricoh Co. \nv. Quanta Comput. Inc., 550 F.3d 1325, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \"Evidence of active steps taken to \nencourage direct infringement, such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage \nin an infringing use, show an affirmative intent that the product be used to infringe, and a showing \nthat infringement was encouraged overcomes the law's reluctance to find liability when a defendant \nmerely sells a commercial product suitable for some lawful use.\" Metro-Goldwyn Mayer Studios \nInc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913,936 (2005) (cleaned up). \nPlaintiff's Complaint alleges that Defendants induced direct infringement of the '451 \npatent \"through [Defendants'] Internet platform and associated [Defendant] apps software and \nservices by thereby providing, inter alia, functionality, instructions, and other assistance that have \nserved to facilitate,. promote, and cause [Defendants'] registered account holders, and/or \npotentially others as yet unknown, to generate, edit, operate, use, publish, save, share, and/or \ncollaborate on infringing automated video playlists.\" (D.I. 1 at 17). Defendants argue that this is \ninsufficient to support an inference of specific intent because Plaintiff has not referenced acts by \nDefendants beyond a formal recitation of the claim elements. (D.I. 12 at 10). \n9 I reject Defendants' argument. As Plaintiff correctly notes, \"Allegations that a defendant \ninstructs or otherwise encourages a customer's infringement are sufficient to state a claim for \ninducement.\" (D.1. 17 at 16). This court found similar specific intent allegations sufficient to plead \ninducement in Telecomm Innovations, LLC v. Ricoh Co., 966 F. Supp. 2d 390 (D. Del. 2013). The \nallegations of the plaintiff in that case-that \"defendants provided technical support and \n' instructions to their customers on how to use products in such a way as to infringe the patented \ninvention,\" id. at 395-are not distinguishable from Plaintiff's allegations that Defendants provide \n\"functionality, instructions, and other assistance\" that serves to facilitate infringement by \nDefendants' customers and others (D.I. 1 at 17). \nI therefore conclude that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to state a claim for induced \ninfringement of the '451 patent and DENY Defendants' motion with respect to this patent. \nE. 'Contributory Infringement of the '451 Patent \nFinally, Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for contributory infringement of the \n'451 patent. (D.1. 12 at 10). To state a claim for contributory infringement, a complaint must plead \nfacts plausibly showing that (1) \"there is direct infringement,\" (2) \"the accused infringer had \nknowledge of the patent,\" (3) \"the component has no substantial noninfringing uses,\" and ( 4) ''the \ncomponent is a material part of the invention.\" Fujitsu Ltd v. Netgear Inc., 620 F.3d 1321, 1326 \n(Fed. Cir. 2010). \nDefendants argue that the Complaint does not satisfy the \"substantial noninfringing uses\" \nelement because Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to render it plausible \"that the accused \nautomated video playlists can only be used in an infringing way.\" (D.I. 12 at 10). \"The Federal \nCircuit has ruled that affirmatively pleading the absence of substantial non-infringing uses renders \nthe claim plausible if the pleadings do not undermine that allegation.\" Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 2015 WL 4036951, at *7 (D. Del. July 1, 2015) (citing In re Bill \n' \nof Lading, 681 F.3d 1323, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012)), report and recommendation adopted, 2015 WL \n4477699 (D. Del. July 22, 2015). \nPlaintiff's Complaint states that Defendants have infringed the '451 patent \"under 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 271(c) ... knowing that [Defendants' allegedly infringing functionality] is not a staple \narticle or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial non-infringing use.\" (D.I. 1 at 17). This \n\"affirmative pleading [of] the absence of substantial non-infringing uses renders the claim \nplausible.\" Merck Sharp & Dahme, 2015 WL 4036951, at *7; see also Express Mobile, Inc. v. \nSquarespace, Inc., 2021 WL 3772040, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 25, 2021) (holding that the complaint \nmet the plausibility pleading standard where the plaintiff stated that there was no substantial non\u00ad\ninfringing use). \nFor these reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's contributory infringement \nclaim is DENIED as to the '451 patent. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n11 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nROBOCAST, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nYOUTUBE, LLC and GOOGLE, LLC, \nDefendant.
