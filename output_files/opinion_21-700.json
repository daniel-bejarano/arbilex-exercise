Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nKenneth Lee-Kay Wan, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, Wilmington,\nDelaware. Counsel for Defendants Michael Adkins and Mark Papili.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 28, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nST USS. District Judge:\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Darron Tillison, who proceeds pvo se, filed this case in the Superior Court of the\nState of Delaware in and for New Castle County on March 4, 2021. (D.I. 1-1 at 2) The case was\nremoved to this Court on May 14, 2021. (D.I. 1) Before the Court is Defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss and Plaintiffs opposition to removal. (D.I. 3, 4)\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe Complaint alleges an unlawful traffic stop on October 18, 2018 following by abduction,\nkidnaping, unlawful detention, and arrest, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution and the Delaware Constitution. (D.I. 1-1 at 2-13) Defendants move to dismiss\non the grounds that the claims are time-barred. (D.L. 3)\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires the\nCourt to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 223\n(3d Cir. 2004). \u201cThe issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant\nis entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d\n1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court may grant such a\nmotion to dismiss only if, after \u201caccepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and\nviewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d Mazo v. Aetna,\nInc, 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mete labels and conclusions. See Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A plaintiff\n\nmust plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of\nShelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not dismissed, however, for imperfect statements of\nthe legal theory supporting the claim asserted. Sve id at 10.\n\n\u201cTo sutvive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018raise a right to relief\nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true (even if\ndoubtful in fact).\u201d\u201d Victanlic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 555). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the\ncoutt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d\nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. At bottom, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff's claim.\nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald assertions,\u201d Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist.,\n132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \u201cunsupported conclusions and\nunwarranted inferences,\u201d Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power \u00a2\u00bb Light Co., 113 F.3d 405,\n417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \u201cself-evidently false,\u201d Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 3d\nCir. 1996). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint,\n\u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted\nby lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff alleges that State actors violated his constitutional rights. Hence, his claims arise\nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) (when bringing \u00a7 1983 claim,\nplaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of federal right, and that person who caused\n\ndeprivation acted under color of state law). The matter was properly removed to this Court.\nFor purposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as personal injury\nactions. See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985). In Delaware, \u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a\ntwo-year limitations period. See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119; Jobason v. Cullen, 925 F. Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del.\n1996). Section 1983 claims accrue \u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury\nupon which its action is based.\u201d Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia, 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\nPlaintiff complains of acts that occurred on October 18, 2018, yet he did not file his\nComplaint until March 4, 2021, some five months after expiration of the two-year limitations period.\nAt first blush, it appears that Plaintiff's complaint is time-barred. Defendants, however, do not\naddress whether the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of Tillison v. Delaware, Civ.\nNo. 19-229-LPS, filed in this Court on February 4, 2019. The complaint in that matter is based\nupon the October 18, 2018 occurrence and was timely filed. It was screened and Plaintiff was given\nleave to amend on ot before June 30, 2020. (See Civ. No. 19-229-LPS D.I. 6) On June 30, 2020,\nPlaintiff filed a motion to stipulate, construed as motion to voluntatily dismiss the case. (Id. D.1. 7,\n8) The case was dismissed on February 12, 2021 and Plaintiff filed the instant case in the Superior\nCourt on March 4, 2021. No party has addressed the issue of tolling; it is not clear if equitable\ntolling applies or if the matter is time-barred. Therefore, the motion to dismiss will be denied\nwithout prejudice to renew.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will deny without prejudice Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.\n\n(DI. 3)\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nDARRON TILLISON,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ.
