(D.I. 2) Before the Court is \nDefendant 's motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. (D.I. 7) \nPlaintiff has filed a response in opposition. (D.I. 8) \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff and Defendant are both residents of Delaware . In the Complaint , \nPlaintiff invokes subject-matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship . \n(D.I. 2 at 3). As alleged in the Complaint and supporting exhibits, Plaintiff and \nDefendant divorced in October 2019. They have been involved in ongoing state\u00ad\ncourt proceedings, primarily involving child support issues regarding their minor \nchild, over whom Plaintiff has primary custody. Plaintiff's allegations , as far as \nthey may be understood from his filings, center around Defendant 's allegedly \nfraudulent attainment of social security disability insurance meant for the care of \nthe minor child, which should have gone to Plaintiff as the primary care provider. \nFor relief, Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $27,496, which he claims is the \namount of Defendant's ill-gotten gains from her fraudulent scheme. \n1 II. DISCUSSION \nFederal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over all civil actions where \nthe matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of \ninterest and costs, and is between citizens of different states. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). \nWhile both the civil cover sheet and the Complaint indicate that subject-matter \njurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship, the parties are not diverse, as \nthey are both Delaware residents, and the $27,496 in controversy is less than the \nrequisite amount of $75,000. \nFederal courts also have federal question jurisdiction over all actions \n\"arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1331. In responding to Defendant's motion to dismiss, Plaintiff seeks to invoke \nthis Court's federal question jurisdiction because \"Social Security is a federally \nfunded program, therefore subjected to federal laws.\" (D.1. 8). \nPlaintiff is mistaken. His claims are against his ex-wife, a private citizen, \nand they sound in state law. Although he, or his minor child, might have \nadministrative recourse available within the Social Security Administration, see \ngenerally 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405G), 1383(a); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.2041(a), 416.641(a), \nPlaintiff has no private right of action under the relevant federal laws, and the \npossibility of administrative recourse does not give this Court federal question \n2 jurisdiction over Plaintiffs claims against his ex-wife. 1 \nAccordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss will be granted and the \nComplaint will be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The dismissal \nwill be without prejudice. See N.J. Physicians, Inc. v. President of U.S., 653 F .3d \n234, 241 n.8 (3d Cir. 2011) ( explaining that dismissals for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction are \"by definition without prejudice\") ( citing Figueroa v. Buccaneer \nHotel Inc., 188 F.3d 172, 182 (3d Cir. 1999)). Given that there is no basis for \n1 Accord Goold v. Smith, 2016 WL 3556924, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 19, 2016) \n(R & R) ( concluding that \"the Social Security Act does not give plaintiff a private \nright of action\" against a private party that fraudulently used his social security \nbenefits); Hurvitz v. Hurvitz, 2015 WL 3905287, at *2 (D.N.H. June 25, 2015) \n(\"Neither 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405G) nor 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a), which concern payments of \nsocial security benefits and representative payees, explicitly provides for a private \nright of action by a beneficiary against a representative payee.\"); Bates v. Nw. \nHuman Servs., Inc., 466 F. Supp. 2d 69, 98-99 (D.D.C. 2006) (noting that \n\u00a7\u00a7 405G) and 1383(a) \"appear to envision the Commissioner of Social Security as \nthe conduit through which an aggrieved beneficiary will recover monies as \ncompensation for payments misappropriated or misused by a representative payee, \nand further contemplate that the Commissioner will then hold the representative \npayee liable for repaying the misused befits to the SSA\"); Pearson v. Payee~ 2013 \nWL 141234, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 11, 2013) (R & R) (\"Therefore, because there \ndoes not appear to be a federal civil private right of action by a beneficiary against \na representative payee for misuse of payments, the court finds that plaintiffs \ncomplaint does not invoke the court's federal question subject matter \njurisdiction.\"); Sylvester v. Sylvester, 2009 WL 3711562, at *2 (D. Minn. Nov. 3, \n2009) (remarking that \"[t]here are several federal laws pertaining to the 'misuse' of \nSocial Security payments by a 'representative payee,\"' but determining that \"those \nlaws provide remedies against representative payees that are enforceable only by \nthe Social Security Administration, and not by individual Social Security \nbeneficiaries who may have been harmed by the misconduct of a representative \npayee.\"). \n3 federal court jurisdiction and no apparent amendment that would confer either \nfederal question or diversity jurisdiction, leave to amend will not be granted. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will grant Defendant's motion to dismiss \nand dismiss this matter without prejudice. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJEROME MOORE, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civil Action No. 22-747-CFC \nLISA MOORE, \nDefendant. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this /v~day of February, 2023 for the reasons set forth in \nthe Memorandum Opinion issued this date, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Defendant's motion to dismiss (D.I. 7) is GRANTED, and the case is \nDISMISSED without prejudice. \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to close the case. "}
