WILLIAMS\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\nPlaintiffs BearBox LLC and Austin Storms (collectively, \u201cBearBox\u201d) filed this action\nagainst Defendants Lancium LLC, Michael T. McNamara, and Raymond E. Cline, Jr.\n(collectively, \u201cLancium\u201d), seeking to correct the inventorship of United States Patent No.\n10,608,433 (\u201cthe *433 patent\u201d), which is assigned to Lancium and lists Michael T. McNamara\n(\u201cMcNamara\u201d) and Raymond E. Cline, Jr. (\u201cCline\u201d) as inventors. Additionally, BearBox seeks to\nrecover for Lancium\u2019s conversion of BearBox\u2019s technology, which is alleged to have been\nimplemented into Lancium\u2019s Smart Response\u2122 software. Pending before the Court is Lancium\u2019s\nFirst Motion for Summary Judgment as to all of BearBox\u2019s claims. DJ. 148. The Court has\nreviewed the parties\u2019 respective briefing, statement of facts, and responses thereto. See, e.g., D.I.\n148; D.I. 149; D.I. 150; D.L. 151; D.L. 176; D.I. 177; D.L. 178; D.I. 179; D.I. 195; D.I. 196. For\nthe reasons explained below, Lancium\u2019s First Motion for Summary Judgment is granted-in-part\nand denied-in-part.\n\nL BACKGROUND\n\nBearBox and Lancium are technology companies at the crossroads of the cryptocurrency\nand renewable energy industries. Their dispute centers around a meeting and subsequent\ncommunications between BearBox\u2019s founder, Austin Storms, and Lancium\u2019s CEO, Michael T.\nMcNamara, beginning at the Fidelity FCAT Mining Summit in Boston, Massachusetts on May 3,\n2019. Based on this string of communications from May 3 to May 9, 2019, BearBox filed this suit\nagainst Lancium, asserting claims of sole inventorship, or alternatively, joint inventorship, of the\n*433 patent, theft of trade secrets, conversion, and unjust enrichment. D.I. 1; D.I. 103.\n\nThe Court struck BearBox\u2019s trade secret claims on April 22, 2022. DJ. 111. Shortly\n\nthereafter, Lancium filed a Motion to Dismiss BearBox\u2019s conversion and unjust enrichment claims\n\n2\n(D.I. 120), which the Court granted-in-part and dismissed the unjust enrichment claim. D.I. 212;\nD.I. 213. Lancium then filed its First Motion for Summary Judgment related to all remaining\nclaims (D.I. 148), and later filed its Second Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Damages\nand its Motion to Exclude Opinions of BearBox\u2019s Expert David Duski (D.L. 167). On October 31,\n2022, Lancium filed its Motion to Bifurcate BearBox\u2019s Patent Inventorship Claims from\nBearBox\u2019s Conversion Claims, and requested expedited consideration. D.I. 222.\n\nLancium\u2019s First Motion for Summary Judgment (\u201cLancium\u2019s Motion\u201d) asserts that\nBearBox\u2019s inventorship claims fail as a matter of law because there is no evidence that Austin\nStorms conceived of, communicated, or collaborated on the inventions of the \u2019433 patent. DI.\n149 at 1-2. Additionally, Lancium\u2019s Motion argues that BearBox\u2019s conversion claim fails as a\nmatter of law because it is barred by Louisiana\u2019s one-year statute of limitations and, alternatively,\nis preempted by federal patent law. D.I. 149 at 30-36. BearBox disputes Lancium\u2019s Motion. D.I.\n176; D.L. 177; D.I. 178; D.I. 179. To aid in the resolution of Lancium\u2019s Motion, the Court held a\nMarkman hearing on October 20, 2022, and later issued a Markman opinion construing two\ndisputed terms of the \u2019433 patent: \u201cpower option agreement\u201d and \u201cminimum power threshold.\u201d\nD.I. 218; D.I. 219. Lancium\u2019s Motion is now ripe for resolution.\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \u201cthat could affect the outcome\u201d of the proceeding. Lamont\nv. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nUSS. 242, 248 (1986)). \u201c[A] dispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient\nto permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d Jd. \u201cThe burden on the\n\nmoving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of\n3\nevidence supporting the non-moving party\u2019s case.\u201d Peloton Interactive, Inc. v. iFIT Inc.,C.A. No.\n20-1535-RGA, 2022 WL 1523112, at *1 (D. Del. May 13, 2022) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n477 US. 317, 323 (1986)).\n\nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue\nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87\n(1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving\nparty asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \u201c(A) citing to\nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored\ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations . . . , admissions, interrogatory answers, or other\nmaterials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish the\nabsence .. . of a genuine dispute... .\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).\n\nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences\nin that party\u2019s favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the non-moving party\nfails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to which it has\nthe burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex Corp.,\n477 US. at 322.\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nLancium argues that the Court must grant summary judgment as to BearBox\u2019s claims of\nsole and joint inventorship because BearBox has failed to produce any evidence that Austin Storms\nconceived of, or communicated to Lancium, the inventions claimed in the \u2019433 patent. D.I. 149 at\n9, 30. Separately, Lancium asserts that it is also entitled to summary judgment as to BearBox\u2019s\n\njoint inventorship claim because BearBox fails to proffer evidence that Austin Storms collaborated\nwith the named inventors of the \u2019433 patent. Finally, Lancium argues that the Court must grant\nsummary judgment as to BearBox\u2019s conversion claim because it is time-barred by Louisiana\u2019s\none-year statute of limitations, or that BearBox\u2019s conversion claim is preempted by federal patent\nlaw. Jd. at 30-36. BearBox disputes each of Lancium\u2019s arguments, asserting that the record is\nreplete with genuine disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment on all of BearBox\u2019s\nclaims. See D.I. 176. The Court finds that there are genuine issues of material fact precluding\nsummary judgment as to BearBox\u2019s sole and joint inventorship claim. However, the Court finds\nthat Lancium is entitled to summary judgment as to BearBox\u2019s conversion claim.\n\nA. Sole Inventorship\n\nLancium moves for summary judgment as to BearBox\u2019s sole inventorship claim, arguing\nthat BearBox has failed to produce any evidence that Austin Storms conceived of, or\ncommunicated to Lancium, the inventions claimed in the \u2019433 patent. D.I. 149 at 9. In response,\nBearBox asserts that there exists genuine issues of material fact regarding Storms\u2019 conception of\nthe inventions claimed in the \u2019433 patent that preclude summary judgment. D.I. 176 at 19. Further,\nBearBox avers that summary judgment must be denied because both testimony and documents\nproduced as evidence corroborate BearBox\u2019s claim that Storms communicated the entirety of the\ninventions claimed in the \u2019433 patent to Lancium. Jd. at 25. Because the Court finds that the\nparties have genuine disputes of material fact as to what Austin Storms conceived of and what was\ncommunicated to Lancium, Lancium\u2019s Motion as to BearBox\u2019s sole inventorship claim is denied.\n\n\u201cPatent issuance creates a presumption that the named inventors are the true and only\ninventors.\u201d Caterpillar Inc. v. Sturman Industries, Inc., 387 F.3d 1358, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2004)\n(citing Hess v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., 106 F.3d 976, 980 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). However,\na party may rebut this presumption by proving, through clear and convincing evidence, that he is\n\nentitled to be named as an inventor and, thus, should have been included on the patent. See Eli\n\n5\nLilly & Co. v. Aradigm Corp., 376 F.3d 1352, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Checkpoint Systems, Inc. v.\nAll-Tag Sec. S.A., 412 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Although failure to include an actual\ninventor on a patent is ordinarily grounds for invalidating that patent, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256 explicitly\npermits a court to order the patent\u2019s correction. See Checkpoint Sys., Inc., 412 F.3d at 1338 (\u201cIfa\npatentee can demonstrate that inventorship can be corrected as provided by [35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256], a\ndistrict court must order correction of the patent, thus saving it from being rendered invalid.\u201d\n(quoting Pannu v. Iolab Corp., 155 F.3d 1344, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 1998))).\n\nA claim of sole inventorship is predicated on proving that the proposed inventor conceived\nof the total patented invention. Ferring B.V. v. Allergan, Inc., 166 F. Supp. 3d 415, 424 (S.D.N.Y.\n2016); see also Univ. of Pittsburgh of Commonwealth Sys. of Higher Educ. v. Hedrick, 2008 WL\n8627085, at *7 (C.D. Cal. June 9, 2008) (\u2018Plaintiffs must show that they conceived of every claim\nof the patent and that any contribution by [the named inventors] to the conception of each and\nevery claim was insignificant.\u201d). \u201cConception is the touchstone of inventorship, the completion\nof the mental part of invention,\u201d and is generally understood to be \u201ca definite and permanent idea\nof the complete and operative invention, as it is hereafter to be applied in practice.\u201d Burroughs\nWellcome Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 40 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (internal quotations\nomitted). A party may demonstrate conception \u201conly when the idea is so clearly defined in the\ninventor\u2019s mind that only ordinary skill would be necessary to reduce the invention to practice,\nwithout extensive research or experimentation.\u201d Jd. at 1228. Notably, \u201can inventor need not know\nthat his invention will work for conception to be complete,\u201d but rather \u201cneed only show that he\nhad the idea; the discovery that an invention works is part of its reduction to practice.\u201d Jd. (citations\n\nomitted).\nAs aclaim of sole inventorship requires proof by clear and convincing evidence, the party\nseeking to be added as an inventor \u201cmust prove his conception by corroborating evidence,\npreferably by showing a contemporaneous disclosure.\u201d Jd. at 1228. This is so because of \u201cthe\ntemptation for even honest witnesses to reconstruct, in a manner favorable to their own position,\nwhat their state of mind may have been years earlier.\u201d Hess, 106 F.3d at 980 (internal quotations\nand citations omitted). Therefore, \u201c[a]n alleged co-inventor\u2019s testimony, or the testimony of the\ninventor himself, standing alone, cannot provide clear and convincing evidence of conception.\u201d\nUniv. of Pittsburg, 2008 WL 8627085, at *9 (citing Caterpillar Inc., 387 F.3d at 1377). Instead,\nthe inventor must independently corroborate its alleged conception through \u201ctestimony of a\nwitness . . . to the actual reduction to practice,\u201d or \u201cevidence of surrounding facts and\ncircumstances independent of information received from the inventor.\u201d Medichem, S.A. v. Rolabo,\nS.L., 437 F.3d 1157, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Documentary or physical evidence made\ncontemporaneously with the inventive process generally provides the most reliable proof of\ncorroboration. See Sandt Tech., Ltd. v. Resco Metal & Plastics Corp., 264 F.3d 1344, 1350-51\n(Fed. Cir. 2001). Ultimately, the Court evaluates the sufficiency of the corroborating evidence\nunder a \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis, which requires evaluating all pertinent evidence so that a sound\ndetermination of credibility of the alleged inventor\u2019s story may be reached. Ethicon, Inc. v. U.S.\nSurgical Corp., 135 F.3d 1456, 1464 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\n\nThe *433 patent comprises of twenty claims that generally relate to systems and methods\nfor adjusting the amount of power available on the electrical grid based on interactions with the\nancillary services markets. See \u2019433 patent at Abstract. BearBox alleges that Austin Storms alone\nconceived of the subject matter in the \u2019433 patent because Lancium merely commercialized Austin\n\nStorms\u2019 systems and methods\u2014through Lancium\u2019s Smart Response\u2122 software\u2014after unlawfully\nobtaining BearBox\u2019s proprietary technical documents during and after the Fidelity FCAT Mining\nSummit. D.I. 176 at 6-12. BearBox bases its sole inventorship claim on the following evidence:\n(1) a Product Details document emailed to Lancium which describes features related to a system\noperating at a maximum power load and having different power usage capabilities over specified\nperiods of time, see, e.g., D.I. 178 at { 5; DL 179, Ex. E at 112:4-115:13 at 95:12; id. at Ex. B; (2)\na diagram titled \u201cBearBox Automatic Mining System Version 1.0,\u201d showing alternative periods of\nmining Bitcoin and curtailment based on external variables such as price of power, see D.I. 179,\nEx. B; (3) an expert report detailing how BearBox\u2019s annotated diagram shows a system that \u201cwould\noperate with power generation assets and the software would continually determine whether it was\nmore profitable to use the electricity from the generation assets to mine Bitcoin or to sell the\nelectricity at the day-ahead or real-time LMP pricing,\u201d see D.J. 179, Ex. C at { 64; see also D.I.\n151, Ex. 3 at 53-80; (4) a proprietary .CSV file manipulating and modeling data to show mining\nor curtailment decisions being determined at regular time intervals, see D.I. 179, Ex. B; see also\nid., Ex. H at 139-150; (5) and Storms\u2019 own detailed testimony related to his purported conception\nof the claimed invention and the events surrounding Storms and McNamara\u2019s communications,\nsee DI. 179, Ex. E at 86-113.\n\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to BearBox and drawing all reasonable\ninferences in its favor, Wishkin, 476 F.3d at 184, the Court finds that BearBox, at a minimum, has\ndemonstrated the existence of genuine issues of material fact related to Austin Storms\u2019 conception\nof the subject matter of the \u2019433 patent. At this stage, the present record is replete with testimony\nand documents that could support a factfinder\u2019s reasonable inference that Austin Storms conceived\nof the \u2019433 patent\u2019s subject matter, as properly construed by this Court, prior to Lancium\u2019s\n\npurported conception. See D.I. 178 at ] 5; see also D.I. 179, Ex. A (undated images of BearBox\u2019s\nhardware and software, and images of whiteboard drawings depicting BearBox\u2019s purported\nconception of the subject matter claimed in the \u2019433 patent). Specifically, Storms testifies\nextensively to the details shared over dinner with McNamara, including a concept for software that\nprovides fine grain control over mining machines and a system that could maximize profitability\nby calculating the most profitable times to mine for Bitcoin or curtail activities and sell power back\nto the grid. D.I. 179, Ex. E at 95:12-105:16. Acknowledging that an alleged inventor\u2019s own\ntestimony is viewed with suspicion, see Sandt Tech., 264 F.3d at 1350-51, BearBox corroborates\nthe substance of Storms\u2019 communications through the Product Details document and the\nproprietary .CSV file, both of which were undisputedly emailed to Lancium following the dinner\nwith McNamara. See D.J. 150 at 13; D.I. 177 at \u00a5 13; DI. 178 at ] 5. Using these documents,\nBearBox\u2019s expert, Dr. McClellan, maps each limitation claimed in the \u2019433 patent to the systems\nand methods allegedly conceived by Storms.! See D.I. 151, Ex. 3 at 57-80.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. McClellan identifies over forty functional source code files Storms\ndisputedly created prior to his communications with McNamara, which BearBox alleges proves\nStorms\u2019 conception of all the claimed aspects of the \u2019433 patent, including the retrieval of data\nfrom remote sources, profitability determinations, and controlling relays to power on miners. D.I.\n176 at 26-27; see also D.I. 151, Ex. 3 at 54-169; D.I. 151 at Appendix A. BearBox asserts that,\nwhile Lancium never obtained these source code files, these files demonstrate a reduction to\npractice that is indicative of Storms\u2019 conception of the \u2019433 patent\u2019s subject matter. D.I. 176 at\n\n26-27; see also Trovan, Ltd. V. Sokymat SA, Irori, 299 F.3d 1292, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2002)\n\n1 To the extent Lancium argues that the corroborating documents BearBox cites do not use the\nterms, as properly construed, that are explicitly used in the \u2019433 patent, it is understood that the\noriginal inventor need only demonstrate possession of the claimed subject matter\u2014the inventor\nneed not use a particular claim term. Apotex Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 2011 WL 6090696, at *18\n(E.D. Pa. Nov. 7, 2011), aff'd, 500 F. App\u2019x 959 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\n\n9\n(\u201c{R]eduction to practice alone is evidence that [plaintiff] had a definite and permanent idea of the\ncomplete and operative invention.\u201d). In essence, BearBox\u2019s submissions with respect to the\nconception of the \u2019433 patent\u2019s subject matter present ample analysis of, and support for, his claim\nof sole inventorship, as well as extensive analysis of both the scientific processes at issue and of\nthe language in the patents themselves. Additionally, BearBox has demonstrated the potential for\nadequate corroboration, through both direct and circumstantial evidence, that Storms conceived of\neach limitation claimed in the \u2019433 patent prior to Storms\u2019 communications with McNamara. See,\ne.g., D.I. 151, Ex. 3 at 57-80; DI. 151 at Appendix A; D.I. 150 (13, 17; D.I. 177 at J 13,17. As\nsuch, BearBox has established the existence of genuine issues of material fact that preclude\nLancium\u2019s Motion as to sole inventorship.\n\nWhile Lancium contends that the present record is devoid of any evidence that supports\nBearBox\u2019s claim that Storms conceived of the entirety of the claimed subject matter of the \u00b0433\npatent, Lancium\u2019s argument centers on disputes about the substance and weight of the testimony\nand corroborating documents that BearBox cites. D.I. 149 at 19-24; D.I. 195 at 11-15. Stated\nanother way, Lancium disputes material facts that are essential to the resolution of who conceived\nof the subject matter of the \u00b0433 patent. At this stage, the Court is not equipped to weigh the\nvolumes of evidence, especially in light of the fact that BearBox has established the existence of\ngenuine issues of material fact. See BASF Corp. v. SNF Holding Co., 955 F.3d 958, 963 (Fed. Cir.\n2020) (\u201c[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge\u2019s function is not himself to weigh the evidence\n....\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Additionally, Lancium conflates the\nrequired proof for corroboration. Lancium contends that the Federal Circuit in Wagner v. Ashline,\n2021 WL 5353889 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 17, 2021) held that evidence corroborating only that the named\n\ninventor and alleged inventor met and discussed other topics is insufficient to meet the\n\n10\ncorroboration standard. D.I. 149 at 23; D.I. 195 at 15. But, Wagner was not decided so narrowly.\nRather, the Federal Circuit was concerned that the only probative evidence corroborating the\nalleged inventor\u2019s claim was from a non-party who testified that the meeting was focused on topics\noutside of the scope of the asserted patents. Wagner, 2021 WL 5353889, at *4-5. In fact, applying\na \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis, the Federal Circuit held that only testimony corroborating that the\nnamed inventor and alleged inventor met and discussed other topics, without additional\ndocumentary or testimonial evidence, is by itself insufficient to meet the corroboration standard.\nId. at *5 (emphasis added). Here, unlike Wagner, BearBox does not corroborate its inventorship\nclaim solely through the testimony of Storms or a non-party; rather, BearBox offers testimonial\nevidence, expert reports, and contemporaneous technical documents to support its claim. See, e.g.,\nDI. 151, Ex. 3 at 57-80; D.I. 151 at Appendix A; D.I. 178 at {{ 4, 5.\n\nAlthough BearBox\u2019s case for sole inventorship of the \u00b0433 patent may be less convincing\nwith respect to some contributions or claims than it is for others, diving into the factual morass of\nanalyzing each claim, a litany of technical documents, and source code files is not a task\nappropriate for the Court at the summary judgment stage. It is enough that the parties\u2019 respective\nsubmissions on this issue indicate the existence of disputed material facts that go directly to the\nheart of BearBox\u2019s claim of sole inventorship. Faced with all of the available documentary\nevidence, expert testimony, and disputed facts, the Court cannot say that no reasonable fact finder\ncould find that there is clear and convincing evidence establishing Storms\u2019 right to be named as\nthe sole inventor on the \u2019433 patent. Summary judgment as to BearBox\u2019s sole inventorship claim\nis denied.\n\nB. Joint Inventorship\n\nSeparately, Lancium argues that BearBox\u2019s joint inventorship claim fails as a matter of law\n\nbecause BearBox has failed to meet its burden of proving Storms collaborated on the inventions\n\n11\nclaimed in the \u2019433 patent. D.I. 149 at 24. As such, Lancium asserts that it is entitled to summary\njudgment on BearBox\u2019s joint inventorship claim. Jd. at 24-30. BearBox disagrees, arguing that\nsummary judgment is precluded because there exist multiple genuine issues of material fact related\nto Storms\u2019 contribution to the \u00b0433 patent\u2019s subject matter. D.I. 176 at 27. The Court agrees with\nBearBox that there are genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment on\nBearBox\u2019s joint inventorship claim.\n\nLike sole inventorship, a purported joint inventor who was erroneously omitted from a\npatent may seek the correction of the patent in federal court. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256. However, the\npurported joint inventor must overcome the presumption that the named inventors of a patent are\ncorrect by meeting the heavy burden of proving his case by clear and convincing evidence. Hess,\n106 F.3d at 980. To satisfy this standard, the claimed joint inventor must provide evidence\ncorroborating his testimony concerning conception of the invention, including contemporaneous\ndocumentary or physical evidence, oral testimony of others, and circumstantial evidence. See\nEthicon, Inc., 135 F.3d at 1461; Trovan, Ltd., 299 F.3d at 1303. The Court evaluates the\nsufficiency of the claimed joint inventor\u2019s corroborating evidence under a \u201crule of reason\u201d\nanalysis, whereby the Court views all evidence before making a sound determination as to the\ncredibility of the claimed inventor\u2019s story.

Storms\u2019\n\u2018system\u2019 was fundamentally different from the system claimed in the \u2019433 patent.\u201d D.I. 195 at 16.\nHowever, the evidence offered to establish that Storms conceived of the entirety of the subject\nmatter claimed in the \u2019433 patent (i.e., to establish BearBox\u2019s sole inventorship claim) is identical\n\n13\nparties\u2014a conversation at a group dinner following the Fidelity FCAT Mining Summit, a series\nof text messages between Storms and McNamara from May 3 to May 9, 2019, and an email Storms\nsent to McNamara with five attachments\u2014fail, as a matter of law, to establish collaboration\nbetween the parties. Jd. Notably, Lancium contends, and BearBox does not dispute, that four of\nthe five attachments emailed to McNamara were publicly available, which Lancium asserts further\nweighs against a finding of collaboration. See D.I. 150 at | 18; D.I. 177 at { 18 (conceding that\nthe attachments, except the .CSV file, are not confidential by themselves, but asserting that the\nentirety of the email, including all attachments, are confidential by virtue of the \u201cConfidentiality\nNotice\u201d at the bottom of that email).\n\nUltimately, rather than contest that there was no corroborating evidence supporting a\nfinding of collaboration, Lancium\u2019s argument relates to the quantity and quality of the\ncommunications between the parties. In doing so, Lancium ignores the undisputed fact that\nMcNamara communicated with Storms for the week following the Fidelity FCAT Mining Summit,\nincluding soliciting product details and supporting documents from Storms via text message. D.I.\n150 at \u00a2 12; D.I. 177 at { 12; see D.I. 179, Ex.

This exchange corroborates Storms\u2019 testimony that\n\nto the evidence that would be offered to prove a significant contribution to the conception of the\ninvention that is required for a claim of joint inventorship.

D.I. 149 at 30. As such, the Court will not reiterate the genuine issues of\nmaterial fact that exist related to Storms\u2019 conception of the subject matter claimed in the \u00b0433\npatent. See supra Section III.A.\n\n14\nMcNamara showed interest in BearBox\u2019s technology and believed that Storms may be valuable to\nMcNamara\u2019s ongoing and future projects. D.I. 179, Ex. E at 95:12-110:6; 114:7-11 (Storms\ntestifying that McNamara was interested in BearBox\u2019s technology during their dinner\nconversation). Also, it is undisputed that Storms responded to McNamara\u2019s texts by emailing\nMcNamara five attachments, including the Product Details document and a proprietary .CSV file,\nwhich disputedly demonstrates Storms\u2019 conception of the claimed inventions of the \u00b0433 patent.\nD.I. 150 at \u00a5 17; D.I. 177 at J 17; D.I. 179, Ex. B; see also supra Section III.A. Despite the fact\nthat the parties did not physically work on the invention together, Storms and McNamara plainly\nhad an \u201copen line of communication ... in temporal proximity to their inventive efforts.\u201d Eli\nLilly & Co., 376 F.3d at 1359; see also CODA Dev. S.R.O. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 916\nF.3d 1350, 1359-60 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Moreover, there is a genuine dispute as to whether the .CSV\nfile emailed to McNamara, and later forwarded to Cline, was incorporated or implemented, in part\nor in whole, into the claimed invention of the \u2019433 patent. See DJ. 179, Ex. H at 139-150 (Cline\ntestifying that when the .CSV file was forwarded to him, he understood the column headers,\nnumerical values, and their respective mathematical relationships).\n\nLancium\u2019s reliance on Rubin v. General Hospital Corp.,2011 WL 1625024 (D. Mass. Apr.\n28, 2011), to cast doubt on the collaboration is misplaced. D.I. 195 at 16-17. In Rubin, the\npurported joint inventors and named inventors never had any direct communication. Id. at *2, *6.\nTo show collaboration, the purported joint inventors relied on their awareness of the named\ninventors\u2019 research and their claim that one of the named inventors read their journal abstract. Jd.\nat *6. However, the Court found this evidence insufficient to establish collaboration, noting that\nthe purported joint inventors filed their own provisional patent application after the alleged\n\ncollaboration without including the named inventors. Jd. at *7. From this, the Court inferred that\n\n15\nthe purported joint inventors did not consider themselves to be collaborating with the named\ninventors. Jd. In the present case, however, the Court cannot conclude that no reasonable fact\nfinder could find that there is clear and convincing evidence establishing collaboration between\nStorms and McNamara based on the following communications: (1) Storms and McNamara\u2019s\ndinner conversation after the Fidelity FCAT Mining Summit\u2014to which the parties dispute the\nextent of what information regarding BearBox\u2019s technology, if any, was shared, see, e.g., D.I. 150\nat J 11; DL. 177 at \u00a5 11; D.I. 179, Ex. E at 95:12-114:11; D.I. 179, Ex. F at 133-135; (2) Storms\nand McNamara\u2019s exchange of text messages from May 3 to May 9, 2019, where McNamara\nundisputedly solicited information about BearBox\u2019s product, see, e.g., D.I. 150 at \u00a2 12; D.I. 177 at\n4 12; D.I. 179, Ex. G; and (3) responsive to McNamara\u2019s solicitation, Storms sent an email to\nMcNamara with five attachments including the Product Details document and the proprietary\nCSV file, see, e.g., D.I. 150 at \u00a7 17; D.I. 177 at \u00a7 17; D.L. 179, Ex. B.\n\nFinally, Lancium\u2019s assertion that the public availability of four of the five attachments\nemailed to McNamara precludes a finding of collaboration is based on a selective interpretation of\nUniv. of Utah v. Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Foerderung der Wissenschaften e.V., 851 F.3d 1317\n(Fed. Cir. 2017). See D.I. 149 at 25-26. In Univ. of Utah, the Federal Circuit agreed with the\ndistrict court\u2019s finding that a published article, which was prior art to the claimed inventions,\n\u201ccould not, on its own, support a finding of collaboration.\u201d 851 F.3d at 1321. However, and\ncontrary to Lancium\u2019s proposition, the Federal Circuit\u2014just three paragraphs later\u2014reiterated that\n\u201cone inventor seeing a relevant report and building upon it might be an element of joint behavior\nsupporting collaboration.\u201d Jd. at 1321-22 (citing Kimberly-Clark, 973 F.2d at 917). Therefore,\nthe public nature of a document does not, by itself, preclude a finding of collaboration. See Dana-\n\nFarber Cancer Inst., Inc. v. Ono Pharm. Co., 964 F.3d 1365, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 2020), cert.\n\n16\ndenied, 141 S. Ct. 2691 (2021) (\u201cInventorship of a complex invention may depend on partial\ncontributions to conception over time, and there is no principled reason to discount genuine\ncontributions made by collaborators because portions of that work were published prior to\nconception for the benefit of the public.\u201d). Because there are genuine issues of material fact\nsurrounding the extent of Storms, McNamara, and Cline\u2019s collaboration related to the subject\nmatter claimed in the 433 patent, Lancium\u2019s Motion as to BearBox\u2019s joint inventorship claim is\ndenied.\n\nCc. Conversion\n\n1. Statute of Limitations\n\nLancium moves for summary judgment of BearBox\u2019s conversion claim, arguing that the\nclaim is barred by Louisiana\u2019s one year statute of limitations. D.I. 149 at 30-33. Specifically,\nLancium contends that BearBox\u2019s currently pled conversion claim, which was brought with its\nSecond Amended Complaint filed on February 16, 2022, falls outside the one-year prescriptive\nperiod because BearBox purportedly admits that it became aware of Lancium\u2019s conversion on\nAugust 17, 2020, when BearBox reviewed the Lancium-Layerl lawsuit. Id.; D.I. 195 at 18-19.\nThus, Lancium argues that BearBox knew, or at a minimum, should have known, of Lancium\u2019s\nconversion because the Lancium-Layer1 lawsuit explains Lancium\u2019s method of arbitraging power\nto maximize profitability, which is allegedly identical to the conduct underlying the currently pled\nconversion claim. See, e.g., D.I. 149 at 32; D.I. 195 at 18-19. Further, Lancium argues that\nBearBox\u2019s operative conversion claim cannot benefit from the Original Complaint\u2019s April 14,\n2021 filing date (D.I. 1), thereby evading the one-year statute of limitations, because the currently\npled conversion claim does not relate back to the originally pled conversion claim. Id.\n\nBearBox vehemently disagrees. First, BearBox maintains that its conversion claim has\n\nbeen consistently pled as arising out of Lancium\u2019s alleged deceptive inducement of BearBox\u2019s\n\n17\npower arbitrage method under the guise of a potential business relationship through Storms and\nMcNamara\u2019s communications in May 2019. D.I. 176 at 31. Thus, BearBox argues its currently\npled conversion claim relates back to the date of the Original Complaint, thereby overcoming the\nstatute of limitations. Jd. at 31-32. Second, BearBox argues that, even if the currently pled\nconversion claim does not relate back to the Original Complaint, it is not barred by the one-year\nstatute of limitations because BearBox did not learn of Lancium\u2019s theft of its specific energy\narbitrage method until December 20, 2021, during Lancium\u2019s document production. Jd. at 32-33.\nIn support of this alternative argument, BearBox contends that the Lancium-Layer1 lawsuit does\nnot even use the word \u201cbreakeven,\u201d and only explains \u201ca high-level description of the bare concept\nof energy arbitrage\u201d instead of disclosing, as Lancium contends, the particular arbitrage method at\nissue in this case. Id. In fact, BearBox asserts that Lancium\u2019s own expert, Dr. Siddiqui, opines\nthat it is impossible to know how specific energy arbitrage methods are used without access to\ndirect evidence of the actual arbitrage method. D.I. 176 at 33; D.I. 179, Ex. W at 34. Thus,\nBearBox argues that simply reading the Lancium-Layerl lawsuit could not serve as actual or\nconstructive knowledge sufficient to commence the one-year statute of limitations. Id.\n\nUnder Louisiana law,> \u201c[a] conversion action sounds in tort and is subject to a one-year\nliberative prescriptive period.\u201d Bihm v. Deca Sys., Inc., 226 So. 3d 466, 280 (La. App. 1st Cir.\n2017) (citing La. Crv. CoDE ANN. art. 3492). Generally, the prescriptive period begins \u201cto run\nfrom the day injury or damage is sustained.\u201d La. CIv. CODE ANN. art. 3492. The injured party\nneed not have actual knowledge of facts that would entitle him to bring a suit. Bihm, 226 So. 3d\n\nat 480 (citing Gallant Investments, Ltd. v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 7 So.3d 12, 19 (La. App. 1st Cir.\n\n3 Neither party disputes that Louisiana law applies to BearBox\u2019s conversion claim. See D.I. 92 at\n5 n.4.\n\n18\n2009)). Rather, notice sufficient \u201cto excite attention and put the party on guard or call for\ninquiry\u201d\u2014referred to as constructive knowledge\u2014can commence the prescriptive period. Bihm,\n226 So. 3d at 480; see also Hogg v. Chevron USA, Inc., 45 So.3d 991, 997 (La. 2010).\n\nWhile claims brought outside the prescriptive period are generally barred, Louisiana\nexplicitly grants amended claims that \u201crelate back\u201d to the original claim the benefit of the\noriginally pleading\u2019s filing date. Clark v. E. Baton Rouge Par. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Works, 196 So. 3d\n142, 146 (La. App. 1st Cir. 2016) (interpreting LA. CODE CIv. PROC. ANN. art. 1153); see also Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 15(c)(1) (an amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading if the \u201claw that\nprovides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back.\u201d). Pursuant to LA. CODE CIv.\nProc. ANN. art. 1153, \u201can amendment to a [complaint] relates back to the date of filing the original\n[complaint] when the action or defense asserted in the amended [complaint] arises out of the\nconduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\u201d\nClark, 196 So. 3d at 146. Courts are encouraged to apply the doctrine \u201cliberally and without undue\nrestriction by technical rules, consistent with the principle that prescriptive statutes are to be\nconstrued in favor of maintaining rather than barring actions.\u201d Id; see also Winford v. Conerly\nCorp., 897 So.2d 560, 568 (La. 2015). As such, an amended complaint is not prescribed by the\nstatute of limitations \u201c[i]f a comparison of the amended petition to the original petition shows that\nthe original petition gave fair notice of the factual situation out of which the amended petition\narises.\u201d Clark, 196 So. 3d at 146 (citing Reese v. State Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety and Corrections, 866\nSo.2d 244, 248 (La. 2004)).\n\nA relation back analysis requires comparing the originally pled claim with the currently\npled claim. Clark, 196 So. 3d at 146. BearBox\u2019s original conversion claim sought recovery for\n\n\u201cDefendants induc[ing] the Plaintiffs to disclose the BearBox Technology to them under the guise\n\n19\nof a possible business deal,\u201d which allegedly began in May 2019 through a meeting between the\ntwo parties, followed by subsequent communications through email and text. See D.I. 1 at {{ 3-4,\n32-36. The Original Complaint defined \u201cBearBox technology\u201d as:\n\nan energy-efficient cryptocurrency mining system and related methods that reduce\n\nthe inefficiency and environmental impact of energy-expensive mining operations\n\nby better utilizing available energy resources to increase stability of the energy grid,\n\nminimize a mining operation\u2019s impact on peak-demand, and also alleviate\n\nelectricity undersupply and/or oversupply conditions . . . [which] can be used to\n\nmine cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin.\n\nD.I. 1 at 2. BearBox\u2019s currently pled conversion claim seeks recovery for Lancium deceptively\ninducing BearBox to disclose BearBox\u2019s \u201csystem designs, documents, data, and know-how\u201d under\nthe guise of a business deal in May 2019. D.I. 103 at ff 3, 89.\n\nThe factual connexity between the original conversion claim and the currently pled\nconversion claim is readily apparent on the face of the pleadings. Both claims seek recovery for\nthe damages resulting from Lancium\u2019s alleged deceptive conduct and theft in May 2019. Compare\nD.L. 1 at 32-36, with D.I. 103 at] 89. While BearBox\u2019s currently pled conversion claim expands\non both the technology purportedly converted, i.e., \u201csystem designs, documents, data, and know-\nhow,\u201d and Lancium\u2019s conduct after the alleged conversion, i.e., using such converted technology\nto modify Lancium\u2019s Smart Response\u2122 software, these amendments do not disturb the relation\nback doctrine because they only serve to elaborate on the facts supporting the underlying theory\nof conversion. D.I. 103 at { 2, 87, 89. That is to say, the conduct supporting the original\nconversion claim is identical to the conduct supporting the currently pled conversion claim,\nregardless of the level of specificity the Second Amended Complaint provides. Tiller v. Atl. Coast\nLine R. Co., 323 U.S. 574, 581 (1945) (the original pleading and the amended pleading \u201crelate to\n\nthe same general conduct . . . the cause of action now, as it was in the beginning, is the same.\u201d).\n\n20\nFurthermore, the Court is not persuaded by Lancium\u2019s assertion that BearBox\u2019s own\nadmissions are fatal to finding that the currently pled conversion claim relates back to the original\nclaim. D.I. 149 at 33. As an initial matter, Lancium\u2019s selective citation to BearBox\u2019s counsel\u2019s\nstatement that the Original Complaint \u201chad nothing to do with energy value arbitrage methods\u201d\nomits a key consideration\u2014BearBox\u2019s counsel was distinguishing between the first Complaint\u2019s\nunderlying trade secret, i.e., system architecture, and the proposed amendment supporting\nBearBox\u2019s new trade secret claims. See D.I. 151, Ex. 22 at 22:16-24:6. And even if BearBox\ncounsel\u2019s characterization of the facts underlying each complaint differ, Lancium\u2019s conclusion\nignores that the conduct underlying the currently pled conversion claim is identical to the conduct\npled in the original conversion claim\u2014the deceptive inducement of BearBox\u2019s methods and\nsystems through Storms and McNamara\u2019s May 2019 communications. Such a rigid comparison\nof the two conversion claims, as Lancium proffers, is contrary to the general principle that La.\nCODE Clv. Proc. ANN. art. 1153 should be liberally construed to do substantial justice. Reese, 866\nSo.2d at 249. As such, the original conversion claim was sufficient to put Lancium on notice that\nBearBox was seeking recovery for conversion of its technology in May 2019. The currently pled\nconversion claim created no surprise or prejudice to Lancium, and merely clarified the facts\nsupporting its theory of conversion, including the specific property converted and Lancium\u2019s\nincorporation of the converted property into its Smart Response\u2122 software\u2014all facts which\nBearBox contends were only brought to light during discovery, which led BearBox to promptly\namend its conversion claim. See D.I. 176 at 31.\n\nBearBox\u2019s currently pled conversion claim can therefore benefit from the Original\nComplaint\u2019s April 14, 2021 filing date. Therefore, it follows that BearBox\u2019s currently pled\n\nconversion claim was brought within the prescribed one-year statute of limitations. Because the\n\n21\nCourt finds that the currently pled conversion claim was brought within the prescribed one-year\nstatute of limitations, the Court need not address Lancium\u2019s argument that BearBox knew, or\nshould have known, of the alleged conversion based on BearBox\u2019s August 17, 2020 review of the\nLancium-Layer1 lawsuit.\n2. Preemption Under Federal Patent Law\n\nSeparately, Lancium moves for summary judgment of BearBox\u2019s conversion claim on the\nground that the conversion claim is preempted by federal patent law. See D.I. 149 at 33-36. The\nCourt agrees.\n\nUnder the Supremacy Clause, state law that conflicts with federal law is without effect.\nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2; see, e.g., Bonito Boats v. Thunder Craft Boats, 489 U.S. 141, 168 (1989);\nHunter Douglas, Inc. v. Harmonic Design, Inc., 153 F.3d 1318, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1998), overruled\nin part on other grounds by Midwest Indus. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir.\n1999). Preemption can take one of three unique forms: explicit, field, or conflict preemption. See\nHunter Douglas, 153 F.3d at 1332. Because federal patent law does not provide explicit\npreemption, see, e.g., 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-376; Hunter Douglas, 153 F.3d at 1332, and because\nCongress does not intend to exclusively occupy the field of conversion law, this case solely\nconcems conflict preemption. Conflict preemption occurs when state law \u201cstands as an obstacle\nto the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d Aronson\nv. Quick Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257, 262 (1979) (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52,\n67 (1941)) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nFederal law preempts state law that offers \u201cpatent-like protection\u201d to discoveries\nunprotected under federal patent law. Bonito Boats, 489 U.S. at 156. Federal patent law reflects\nthe objectives of Congress, which includes: (1) \u201cseek[ing] to foster and reward invention\u201d; (2)\n\n\u201cpromot[ing] disclosure of inventions to stimulate further innovation and to permit the public to\n\n22\npractice the invention once the patent expires\u201d; (3) promoting \u201cthe stringent requirements for\npatent protection . . . to assure that ideas in the public domain remain there for the free use of the\npublic,\u201d Aronson, 440 U.S. at 262 (citing Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 480-81\n-(1974)); (4) providing a \u201cclear federal demarcation between public and private property\u201d; and (5)\npromoting \u201cnationwide uniformity in patent law.\u201d Bonito Boats, 489 U.S. at 162-63. A state cause\nof action that frustrates these objectives is preempted. Id. at 156-57; Aronson, 440 USS. at 262.\nIn the specific context of a conversion claim, courts have differentiated between claims\nthat are dependent on a determination of patent inventorship or ownership and those that are based\non a non-patent theory of conversion. Claims that are dependent on a determination of patent\ninventorship or ownership, such as a misappropriation of patent rights, are generally preempted by\nfederal patent law. See Smith v. Healy, 744 F. Supp. 2d 1112, 1130 (D. Or. 2010) (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019\nproposed conversion claim does not concern Plaintiffs\u2019 tangible property but rather their intangible\nidea... therefore .. . Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed conversion claim would be preempted by [federal] patent\nlaw.\u201d). In contrast, claims that can be established without reference to patent inventorship or\nownership are generally not preempted by federal patent law. See HIF Bio, Inc. v. Yung Shin\nPharms. Industrial Co., 600 F.3d 1347, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (suggesting that plaintiffs could\nestablish a conversion claim not preempted by federal law by basing their claim on defendants\u2019\nalleged misappropriation of experiments, experimental data, and non-public drafts of papers).\nBearBox\u2019s conversion claim begins by incorporating by reference the allegations from\nBearBox\u2019s correction of inventorship claims.

BearBox then explains how\nLancium\u2019s \u201cunlawful exercise of dominion over confidential BearBox technology, including\nsystem designs, documents, data, and know-how not otherwise found to be a trade secret, or having\n\nvalue beyond the value of the trade secret(s), has permanently interfered with [BearBox\u2019s] valuable\n\n23\nproperty rights.\u201d D.I. 103 at \u00a2 88. Finally, BearBox outlines that it \u201c[has] suffered and will\ncontinue to suffer damages and other financial harms\u201d because Lancium \u201c[has] not compensated\nor recognized [BearBox] for the use of BearBox\u2019s technology.\u201d D.I. 103 at ff 89-90.\n\nBy its wording, it is clear that BearBox\u2019s conversion claim is \u201cpatent-like\u201d in nature and\nalso turns on a determination of inventorship regarding the subject matter of the \u2019433 patent. See\nSmith, 744 F. Supp. 2d at 1130. Although conversion under Louisiana law does not necessarily\nimplicate patent law, the theory underlying BearBox\u2019s conversion claim\u2014the theft of BearBox\u2019s\nsystem designs, documents, data, and know-how which was integrated and monetized by Lancium\nthrough its Smart Response\u2122 software, without compensating or recognizing BearBox\u2014seeks\nprotection and remedial compensation for the alleged misappropriation of BearBox\u2019s novel ideas.\nD.I. 103 at \u00a7 89. In other words, BearBox\u2019s claim that Lancium \u201chas permanently interfered with\n[BearBox\u2019s] valuable property rights\u201d by misappropriating BearBox\u2019s technology is a second bite\nof the apple to correct inventorship if the Court were to find that Storms is neither a sole nor joint\ninventor of the *433 patent.\n\nBearBox\u2019s attempt to differentiate its conversion claim as relying on a non-patent theory\nof recovery is unsuccessful. While the Court recognizes that BearBox amended its pleading to\nallege that \u201c[n]ot all aspects of BearBox\u2019s technology that was stolen and used by Defendants was\ndescribed and claimed in the \u00b0433 Patent,\u201d see D.I. 103 at { 46, this allegation cannot serve as the\nbasis for a non-patent theory of recovery. This is because BearBox\u2019s own expert, Dr. McClellan,\nconcedes that regardless of whether the \u2019433 patent actually discloses BearBox\u2019s power arbitrage\nmethod, BearBox is barred from using its power arbitrage method because it may likely infringe\nthe \u00b0433 patent. See D.I. 196-1, Ex. 30 at 231:10-232:1. Stated another way, the alleged converted\n\nproperty is described and disclosed in the 433 patent. See id. at 231:18-232:1 (\u201cIf [Storms] were\n\n24\nto use his {power arbitrage method], it might be infringing the [\u2019433] patent anyway. Even if he\nused his system\u2014because the arbitrage adds onto the capabilities disclosed in the patent. It adds\nsome things onto that aren\u2019t specifically disclosed in the patent, but they\u2019re hinted at. . . . even if\nyou implemented a system like this, . . . you may end up infringing the patent regardless.\u201d).\nFurther, BearBox\u2019s attempt to reconcile its conversion claim as a non-patent theory of recovery is\nfurther belied by its own arguments and headings in its Answering Brief. For example, BearBox\u2019s\nheading stating that \u201cLancium filed the \u2019433 patent to monopolize Storms\u2019 portions of the system\nthat Storms communicated to it,\u201d see D.I. 176 at 12, supports the reasonable conclusion that all the\ncommunications sent to Lancium served as the foundation for the \u2019\u00b0433 patent. This contradicts\nBearBox\u2019s own assertion that not everything communicated, and therefore converted, served as\nthe basis for the \u2019433 patent. See D.I. 103 at (46. The Court\u2019s conclusion is also supported by\nthe fact that BearBox\u2019s conversion claim begins by incorporating by reference its inventorship\nclaims. D.I. 103 at 84.\n\nThat BearBox\u2019s conversion claim seeks to recover patent-like damages further supports\nthat it is preempted by federal patent law. There is no dispute that, under Louisiana law, \u201c[t]he\nmeasure of damages for wrongful conversion is the return of the property, or if it cannot be\nreturned, the value of the property at the time of conversion.\u201d Capers v. NorthPro Properties\nMemt, LLC, 321 So. 3d 502, 514 (La. App. 2d Cir. 2021). However, rather than solely demand\nthe return of its allegedly converted property, BearBox repeatedly pursues monetary damages akin\nto a royalty-like payment. D.I. 103 at \u00a7{ 6, 89, \u201cPrayer for Relief\u201d at | G. BearBox\u2019s Second\nAmended Complaint is also replete with assertions advancing the theme that BearBox is entitled\nto monetary damages because of Lancium\u2019s purported failure to compensate or recognize BearBox\n\nfor the use of BearBox\u2019s converted technology. See, e.g., id. at | 6 (\u201cPlaintiffs bring this action to\n\n25\nrecover damages caused by Defendants\u2019 theft and unauthorized use, and subsequent exploitation\nof Plaintiffs system design, data, documents, and know-how.\u201d); id. at {50 (\u201cDefendants have used\nBearBox\u2019s technology, including the stolen system designs, diagrams, data, and know-how, and\nits subsequently-modified Smart Response\u2122 software ... to allow Defendants to profit\nsignificantly from use, license, sale, and investments related to its modified Smart Response\u2122\nsoftware. Defendants are not, and have never, been entitled to these profits.\u201d) (emphasis added);\nid. at 87 (\u201cWithout Plaintiffs\u2019 consent, Defendants intentionally and willfully assume dominion\nand control over BearBox\u2019s technology, including system designs, documents, data, and know-\nhow, and improperly used it to modify their Smart Response\u2122 software . . . and subsequently\nused, sold, licensed, and procured investments related to, and otherwise monetized, that software\nfor substantial profit.\u201d); id. at { 89 (\u201cDespite providing Defendants with the system designs,\ndocuments, data, and know-how that allowed Defendants to modify their Smart Response\u2122\nsoftware, and corresponding system designs, Defendants have not compensated or recognized\nPlaintiffs for the use of BearBox\u2019s technology. Defendants\u2019 actions constitute an improper and\nunauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d) (emphasis added); id. at 90 (\u201cAs a result of Defendants\u2019\nimproper and unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 system designs, documents, data, and know-how to\nreconstruct and use BearBox\u2019s technology, Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer\ndamages and other financial harms in an amount to be proven at trial.\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\nBy these allegations\u2019 wording, it is clear that BearBox\u2019s damages are predicated on the\nresolution of inventorship or ownership of the technology disclosed in the \u00b0433 patent. That\nBearBox seeks patent-like damages is further supported by BearBox\u2019s own damages expert, David\nDuski, who both reaffirms that BearBox seeks monetary damages in, effectively, a repackaged\n\nform of a royalty payment, and reasserts BearBox\u2019s theme that monetary damages are necessary\n\n26\nto compensate or recognize BearBox for use of BearBox\u2019s converted technology. D.I. 170, Ex. 25\nat 8 (\u201c[T]he value of the Converted Property may be determined by calculating the present value\nof the future cash flows Lancium expected to receive attributable to the Converted Property at the\ntime of conversion.\u201d); id. at 14 (\u201cI understand that through the use of the Converted Property,\nLancium will be able to craft voluntary reduction and/or bid strategies that ensure maximum\nprofits.\u201d); see, e.g., Speedfit LLC v. Woodway USA, Inc., 226 F. Supp. 3d 149, 160 (E.D.N.Y.\n2016) (concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim was preempted by federal patent law, where\nplaintiffs\u2019 underlying conversion claim sought royalty-like damages that ultimately required a\ndetermination of inventorship). Therefore, considering the totality of evidence, BearBox\u2019s\nconversion claim is preempted by federal patent law because the right involved here and\ncompensated for relies on a theory of conversion that is \u201cpatent-like\u201d in nature. Lancium\u2019s Motion\nrelated to BearBox\u2019s conversion claim being preempted by federal patent law is granted, and\nBearBox\u2019s conversion claim (Count V) is dismissed with prejudice.\nIV. LANCIUM\u2019s PENDING MOTIONS\n\nIn addition to Lancium\u2019s First Motion for Summary Judgment (D.I. 148), Lancium also\nfiled a Second Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Damages combined with a Motion to\nExclude Opinions of David Duski (D.I. 167), and a Motion to Bifurcate BearBox\u2019s Patent\nInventorship Claims from the Conversion Claims (D.I. 222) (collectively, \u201cLancium\u2019s Pending\nMotions\u201d). However, as both of Lancium\u2019s Pending Motions solely depend on BearBox\u2019s\nconversion claim\u2014which has now been dismissed with prejudice\u2014the Court will deny Lancium\u2019s\nPending Motions as moot.\n\nThe Court will issue an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n27\n"}
