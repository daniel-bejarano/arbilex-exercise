Anderson , FISH & RICHARDSON P.C., Wilmington, Delaware . \n \nCounsel for Defendants . \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \nSeptember 28, 2022  \nBIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nStarting a business is tough. Starting a technology company from scratch can be \neven tougher.  As Goddess Approved Productions learned , sometimes everything goes \nwrong .   \n2 Although Goddess  is understandably disappointed by its dealings with Wolox and \nSirvart,  it cannot so easily turn its disappointment into legal claims. Thus , I dismiss \nmost  of its claims , but not all.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nGoddess is a startup technology company. It wanted to develop an app  letting con-\nsumers use their phones to identify groceries\u2019  nutritional information. Compl., D.I. 1 \n\u00b6\u00b6 10, 12.  It hired Wolox, a n Argentinian  software company, to help develop the app. \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11, 15. On March 26, 2018, the parties formed  a Mas ter Services Agreement. \nId. \u00b6 15. \nThat Agreement specified that \u201c[a]ll work to be performed by\u201d Wolox would be \ncovered by a corresponding \u201cStatement of Work.\u201d Each  Statement of Work, in turn, \nwould determine a given project\u2019s specifications and deliverable s. Master Services \nAgreement, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 1.1. The Agreement made clear that if it ever conflicted with a \nStatement of Work, the Statement of Work would control. Id. \u00b6 11. The Agreement \nalso included standard integration and no -oral-modification clause s. Id. \nThe first  Statement  of Work  covered \u201cthe Prototype stage, the Product Design \nstage and the first three months of development for the MVP version of the Applica-\ntion.\u201d Statement of Work No.  1, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 2. \nUnder the Statement , Wolox agreed to \u201cdevelop a \u2018 proof -of-concept\u2019 prototype al-\ngorithm.\u201d That prototype algorithm was  supposed  to \u201cfunction with 8 -10 popular \nproducts\u201d and \u201cbe able to take a video stream and generate an output video displaying \na frame marking the position of the detected grocery store products with their corre-\nsponding name.\u201d Id. \u00b6 4.3.  \n3 This protype would \u201cnot run on a mobile phone and [would] not run in r eal time.\u201d \nId. Instead, it would \u201cmerely serve to show that the algorithm works on real -time \ndata  running on a [computer ] device. \u201d Id. (emphasis added).  So, in theory,  the proto-\ntype algorithm would receive  a video  of unmarked groceries and , \u201cafter a few se c-\nonds ,\u201d show a new video with marked products. Id. \nDevelopment did not go well. Wolox never developed a  functioning ten -product \nprototype . Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  19, 27. But its executives continued to convey \u201chope\u201d that \nthey could deliver a 500 -product version . Id. \u00b6 27; see also id.  \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21, 24 \u201325, 28, 33. \nWolox\u2019s versions of the app remain riddled with errors. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 37\u201360. \nSo Goddess sues Wolox on a range of theories. It also sues Sirvart, a Uruguayan \ncompany to which it gave an $80,000 promissory note in exchange for Wolox\u2019s dis-\ncounted rates. Id. \u00b6 17; Convertible Promissory Note, D.I. 1 -2. Wolox and Sirvart have \nsince moved to dismiss Goddess\u2019s claims. D.I. 9.  \nTo survive, Goddess\u2019s Complaint must \u201ccontain sufficient factual matter, accepted \nas true, to st ate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And as the contract speci-\nfies, I apply Delaware substantive law. Master Services Agreement, D.I 1 -1 \u00b6 11; 6 \nDel. C.  \u00a7 2708 . \nII. GODDESS\u2019S CORE BREACH -OF-CONTRACT CLAIMS AGAINST WOLOX SURVIVE  \nTo adequately plead breach of contract, Goddess must show (1) the existence of a \ncontract , (2) \u201cthe breach of an obligation imposed by that contract ,\u201d and (3) resulting \ndamage to  it. VLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett -Packard Co. , 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del. 2 003).  \n4 I must read the contract as a whole and enforce its plain meaning. Manti Holdings, \nLLC v. Authentix Acquisition Co. , 261 A.3d 1199, 1208 (Del. 2021).   \nGoddess  plausibly alleges that Wolox breached its obligations to create function-\ning prototypes  of the app. But it does not  plausibly allege that Wolox was oblig ated \nto create  a fully scalable app.  \nA. Wolox allegedly breached its duty  to create a ten -product version of \nthe app \nThe first Statement of Work required Wolox to develop a \u201cproof -of-concept proto-\ntype algorithm\u201d that would \u201cfunction with 8 -10 popular products.\u201d Statement of Work \nNo. 1, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 4.3 (internal quotation marks omitted). Goddess alleges that Wolox \nfailed to develop this prototype. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  19, 27.  \nWolox disagrees. It says that the parties\u2019 second amendment to the Statement of \nWork proves that it delivered a functioning proto type. D.I. 10 at 6 \u20137. And i t points to \na provision  that required  Goddess to object within thirty days  if Wolox \u201cperform [ed]\u201d \nor \u201cdeliver [ed]\u201d a deficient  service or  product . Master Services Agreement, D.I. 1 -1 \n\u00b6 1.4; D.I. 10 at 6 \u20137. But th e second amendmen t simply calls for more hours of Wolox\u2019s \nwork. Second Am. to the First Statement of Work, D.I. 1 -1 at 22. So without proof of \ndelivery, Wolox cannot specify when Goddess should have objected. On the facts al-\nleged, the object -or-waive provision of the Agree ment does not apply . Goddess plau-\nsibly alleges that Wolox failed to develop a functioning ten-product prototype algo-\nrithm.   \n5 B. Wolox also allegedly breached its duty to develop a functioning 500 -\nproduct version  \nThe next question is whether Wolox was contractua lly obligated to develop a 500 -\nproduct version of the app. True, the first Statement of Work expressly referred only \nto the ten -product prototype. Statement of Work No.  1, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 4.3. But Goddess \nalleges that Wolox executives made several representatio ns showing the company\u2019s \nintent to provide Goddess with a \u201c500  products version.\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  27\u201330; see \nalso id.  \u00b6 19. \nWolox hangs its hat on the Agreement\u2019s no -oral-modification clause: \u201cNo changes \nor modifications or waivers to this Agreement will  be effective unless in writing and \nsigned by both Parties.\u201d Master Services Agreement, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 11. Because Wolox\u2019s  \nrepresentations about a 500 -product version were not in signed writings, it says, it \ndid not need  to produce  that version . D.I. 10 at 10 \u201311. \nBut there is a way around that clause . The \u201c existence of [a joint integratio n and \nno-oral modification clause] does not prohibit the modification of making of a new \nagreement by conduct of the parties, despite a prohibition [] against any change ex-\ncept by written bilateral agreement.\u201d In re Coinmint, LLC , 261 A.3d 867, 899 \u2013900 \n(Del. Ch. 2021) (alterations in original ) (emphasis added) (quoting Pepsi -Cola Bot-\ntling Co. of Asbury Park v. Pepsico, Inc. , 297 A.2d 28, 33 \u201334 (Del. 1972)).  \nGoddess plausibly alleges that Wolox had to develop a 500 -product app. The First \nStatement of Work co ntemplated \u201cchanges in scope\u201d that would be accepted via email \nand reflected in \u201can amendment to this Statement of Work.\u201d Statement of Work No.  1, \nD.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 4.4. In August 2018, a Wolox executive stated by email that \u201c[f]or the MVP  \n6 App, we will include 50 0 products.\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  19. A month later, the parties \namended the Statement of Work, and Wolox said it would \u201cstart with the development \nof the MVP.\u201d First Am. to the First Statement of Work, D.I. 1 -1 at 3.  \nSo Goddess\u2019s breach -of-contract claim base d on Wolox\u2019s failure to develop a 500 -\nproduct app also survives. Pepsi -Cola , 297 A.2d at 33;  cf. CPC Mikawaya Holdings, \nLLC v. MyMo Intermediate, Inc. , 2022 WL 2348080, at *12 \u201314 (Del. Ch. June 29, \n2022)  (explaining that waiver of a no -oral-modification cl ause typically survives a \nmotion to dismiss, even if ultimately difficult to prove, because it is a fact -intensive \ninquiry) ; Good v. Moyer , 2012 WL 4857367, at *5 \u20136 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 10, 2012).  \nC. But Wolox did not promise to create a fully scalable app  \nGoddess also asserts that Wolox \u201cagreed to develop a scalable mobile application \nversion of the App which would ultimately be able to recognize hundreds of thousands \nof products to be commercially viable.\u201d  D.I. 1 \u00b6 70. But the contract never says this . \nThe first Statement of Work  covered just \u201cthe first three months of development  for \nthe MVP version of the application. \u201d Statement of Work No.  1, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 2; see also \nD.I. 15 at 8 & n.1. Indeed, Goddess\u2019s own Complaint belies its  grand assertion.  Be-\ncause  \u201cWolox had completely failed to develop a function ing 500-product [MVP],\u201d God-\ndess never agreed \u201cto begin the next development phase.\u201d  Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  22\u201323. \nWolox thus did not breach any obligation to develop a fully scalable app.  \nIII. MOST OF GODDESS\u2019S OTHE R BREACH -OF-CONTRACT CLAIMS FAIL \nGoddess also alleges breaches of less central  obligations. It claims that Wolox \nbreached the contract by (1) \u201cdeveloping an App with outdated code ,\u201d (2) \u201cbilling [God-\ndess] for work that was never performed ,\u201d (3) \u201cfailing to  return deliverables [and]  \n7 documents ,\u201d (4) \u201crefusing\u201d to demonstrate the  app, and (5) \u201cfailing to follow the \nSCRUM methodology in developing the App .\u201d Compl., D.I.  1 \u00b6\u00b6 72\u201374, 76 \u201377. All but \nthe last claim fail . \nA. The outdated -code claim fails  \nGoddess complains that Wolox used \u201cPython  2,\u201d which was slated for obsolescence \nby 2020. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  61\u201363. But the contract stated only that the app\u2019s code \nwould support iPhones and Androids; it did not specify the use of any particular cod-\ning langu age. Statement of Work No.  1, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 4.3(a) \u2013(b). So this claim fails.  \nB. The billing claim fails  \nGoddess baldly asserts that Wolox \u201cfraudulently billed [Goddess] for hours of work \nthat w [ere] never performed.\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  67. Without more, Goddess fails to state \na plausible claim.  \nC. The documents -and-deliverables claim fails  \nGoddess also claims that Wolox failed or refused to provide it with many docu-\nments and deliverables. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  64\u201366. These documents and deliverables \nincluded things like \u201cTesting Documents,\u201d \u201cProduct Information List Export[s],\u201d  and \n\u201cintellectual property/code.\u201d Id. The Agreement indeed provides for the return of \u201call \nConfidential Information,\u201d but only upon (1) the \u201cte rmination or expiration\u201d of the \nAgreement or Statement of Work, or (2) a party\u2019s request. Master Services Agree-\nment, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 3.3.  \nGoddess fails to plead that the Agreement or first Statement of Work ever termi-\nnated or expired. See id.  \u00b6 3.2. Nor does i t plead sufficient facts showing that it re-\nquested this information. See id.  \u00b6 3.3. So its claim  cannot proceed  as alleged .  \n8 D. The demonstration claim fails  \nGoddess next alleges that Wolox refused to demonstrate the  app\u2019s \u201cbackend\u201d  or \nhow it worked \u201cas a whole .\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  68. But the parties\u2019 contract provided \nonly for \u201cfunctionality demos\u201d at the end of every two -week \u201csprint\u201d period. Statement \nof Work No.  1, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 3.1. Goddess thus fails to plausibly allege  a breach  on this \nground . \nE. But the SCRUM -methodology claim survives  \nGoddess asserts that by trying \u201cto implement the entire processing pipeline at \nonce from the PC version to\u201d the Apple version, Wolox deviated from the agreed -upon \nSCRUM method. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  29. That  method called for Wolox \u201cto deliver work-\ning functionalities within a short timespan\u201d \u2014here, two weeks. Statement of Work \nNo. 1, D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6 3.1. Goddess plausibly alleges that in implementing the pipeline \nwholesale rather than piecemeal, Wolox breached its duty . So this claim survives.  \nIV. GODDESS\u2019S GOOD-FAITH -AND-FAIR-DEALING  CLAIM  FAILS \nThe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing bars a contractual party from \nengaging in \u201carbitrary or unreasonable conduct\u201d  against its counterpart y. Dunlap v. \nState Farm Fire & Cas. Co. , 878 A.2d 434, 440 \u201342 (Del. 2005) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). It is a \u201crare\u201d remedy. Id. at 442. Put simply,  litigants cannot  repack-\nage breach -of-contract claims as breach -of-the-implied -covenant claims. Kuroda v. \nSPJS Holdings , L.L.C. , 971 A.2d 872, 888 (Del. Ch. 2009).   \nGoddess alleges that Wolox engaged in various misdeeds  that breach ed the im-\nplied covenant. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  119\u201324; D.I. 15, at 19 . But Goddess\u2019s allegations \nmerely echo those made in its breach -of-contract cl aims. See Compl., D.I. 1  \u00b6\u00b6 71\u201375.  \n9 So the express terms of the agreements control, and the implied covenant is inappli-\ncable. See Kuroda , 971 A.2 d at 888. \nThus , I dismiss Goddess\u2019s implied -covenant claim without prejudice.  \nV. GODDESS\u2019S UNJUST -ENRICHMENT CLAIM FAILS \nTo plead unjust enrichment, Goddess must allege : \u201c(1)  an enrichment, (2)  an im-\npoverishment, (3)  a relation between the enrichment and impoverishment, (4)  the ab-\nsence of justification, and (5)  the absence of a remedy provided by law.\u201d  Nemec v. \nShrader , 991 A.2d 1120, 1130 (Del. 2010).  \nGoddess insists that Wolox was \u201cunjustly enriched at [Goddess\u2019s] expense by lying \nto [Goddess] and causing [Goddess] to pay for [Wolox\u2019s] completely defective and \nfaulty work, and for work [Wolox] never p erformed.\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  80. \nAs discussed , Goddess fails to allege  facts plausibly showing that Wolox lied and \nbilled for work  that it never did . Plus, Goddess cannot claim unjust enrichment \nwhere, as here, \u201cthe contract is the measure of plaintiff[ \u2019s] right[s].\u201d Wood v. Coastal \nStates Gas Corp. , 401 A.2d 932, 942 (Del. 1979); accord Tolliver v. Christina Sch. \nDist. , 564 F. Supp. 2d 312, 315 \u201316 (D. Del. 2008).  \nSo I dismiss its unjust enrichment claim without prejudice.  \nVI. GODDESS\u2019S TORT CLAIMS FAIL \nGoddess sues Wolox for several different torts . For largely similar reasons, all fail.  \nA. Goddess does not plead fraudulent inducement or wanton and willful  \nmisconduct  \nFor its fraudulent -inducement  claim to survive, Goddess must plead:  \n\u2022 Wolox\u2019s false representation, \u201cusually one of fact ,\u201d  \n10 \u2022 Wolox\u2019s \u201cknowledge or belief\u201d in the representation\u2019s falsity , \n\u2022 Wolox\u2019s \u201cintent to induce\u201d Goddess to form a contract , \n\u2022 Goddess\u2019s actions taken \u201cin justifiable reliance\u201d upon Wolox\u2019s false repre-\nsentations , and \n\u2022 Goddess\u2019s damage resulting from its reliance.  \nStephenson v. Capano Dev., Inc. , 462 A.2d 1069, 1074 (Del. 1983).  \nGoddess alleges that Wolox \u201cknowingly and fraudulently indu ced\u201d Goddess into \nthe contract \u201cby representing that [Wolox] would apply the skill, proficiency, technol-\nogy and support to develop the App.\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  84; see also id. \u00b6 13. These are \nconclusory statements, not allegations of fact. They also  fail to  meet Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure  9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading requirement  for fraud . See In re Rockefel-\nler Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 311 F.3d 198, 216 \u201317 (3d Cir. 2002).  \nGoddess also alleges that Wolox \u201cknowingly and fraudulently induced\u201d Goddess \ninto \u201cpaying for services by representing \u2026 that the App was close to completion and \nwas able to recognize 500 products.\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  85; see also id. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21, 24, 27 \u2013\n28, 33. While these allegations are more particular, they fail under Delaware sub-\nstantive law. Goddess cannot claim fraud  by alleging merely that Wolox  never in-\ntended to fulfill its obligations . Narrowstep, Inc. v. Onstream Media Corp. , 2010 WL \n5422405, at *12 \u201315 (Del. Ch. Dec. 22, 2010) ; Grunstein v. Silva , 2009 WL 4698541, \nat *12 \u201314 (Del. Ch. Dec. 8 , 2009) . \nI thus  dismiss Goddess\u2019s fraudulent -inducement claims without prejudice.  \nGoddess\u2019s wanton -and-willful -misconduct claims are the same as  its fraudulent - \n11 inducement claims. Compare Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  130(a) \u2013(h), with id.  \u00b6\u00b6 84\u201391. \u201cEven \nan intentional, knowing, wanton, or malicious action by the defendant will not sup-\nport a tort claim if the plaintiff cannot assert wrongful conduct beyond the breach of \ncontract itself.\u201d Data Mgmt.  International\u00e9, Inc. v. Saraga , 2007 WL 21428 48, at *3 \n(Del. Super. Ct. July 25, 2007). So for the same reasons as the fraudulent -inducement \nclaims, I  dismiss these claims too.  \nB. Nor does  Goddess plead negligent misrepresentation or gross \nnegligence  \nTo plausibly plead negligent misrepresentation, Godde ss must show \u201call of the \nelements of \u2026 fraud[ulent inducement] except that [it] need not demonstrate that the \nmisstatement or omission was made knowingly or recklessly.\u201d Williams v. White Oak \nBuilders, Inc. , 2006 WL 1668348, at *7 (Del. Ch. June 6, 2006) ( internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nBut Goddess runs into a similar roadblock as it did with its fraudulent -\ninducement  claims: \u201c[W]here the action is based entirely on a breach of the terms of \na contract between the parties, and not on a violation of some d uty imposed by law , \nan action [in tort] will not lie.\u201d Garber v. Whittaker , 174 A. 34, 36 (Del. Super. Ct. \n1934).  \nIndeed, Wolox\u2019s allegedly negligent misrepresentations \u201call relate to [Wolox]\u2019s con-\ntractual duty to deliver software free from defects.\u201d Liver y Coach Sols., L.L.C. v. Mu-\nsic Express/E ., Inc. , 245 F. Supp. 3d 639, 645 \u201346 (D. Del. 2017). Goddess\u2019s Complaint \nconfirms as much. Compare Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  71\u201375, with id.  \u00b6\u00b6 95\u2013102. So Goddess\u2019s \nnegligent -misrepresentation claims fail.   \n12 For Goddess\u2019s gross -negligence claims, the same analysis compels the same con-\nclusion. Goddess fails to show that Wolox owed it a duty \u201cimposed by law\u201d rather than  \none imposed by contract. Garber , 174 A. at 36.  Goddess parrots the same allegations \nas in its negligent -misrepresentation claim, simply replacing \u201cnegligently\u201d with \n\u201cgrossly negligent.\u201d Compare Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  95\u2013102, with id.  \u00b6\u00b6 106\u201313. Its at tempt \nto trans form  a breach -of-contract claim into a gross -negligence claim thus fails too.  \nC. No professional -negligenc e claim against software developers exists  \nGoddess invites me to craft  a new cause of action under Delaware law: professional \nnegligence  against software developers. D.I. 15 at 16. Like the other courts that have \nconsidered this question, I decline to do s o. See Superior Edge, Inc. v. Monsanto Co. , \n44 F. Supp. 3d 890, 911 \u201314 (D. Minn. 2015).  \nSo I dismiss Goddess\u2019s professional -negligence claim with prejudice.  \nVII. GODDESS\u2019S CLAIMS AGAINST SIRVART ALL FAIL \nGoddess also sues Sirvart, but its real gripe is with Wolox. True, the Note between \nGoddess and Sirvart references as consideration the \u201cdelivery of software developed \nby [the] Holder\u201d and defines Sirvart as the \u201cHolder.\u201d Convertible Promissory Note, \nD.I. 1-2 at 2. Yet the Master Services Agreement, the first Statement of Work, and \nthat Statement\u2019s two amendments all say they were \u201centered into \u2026 by and between \nGoddess \u2026 and Wolox.\u201d D.I. 1 -1 at 2, 5, 13, 22. The Complaint mentions Sirvart\u2019s \nspecific conduct  only twice: in describing the Note\u2019s execution, and in alleging that \n\u201cSirvart and Wolox are associated corporations.\u201d Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  17, 135.  \nSensing these deficiencies, Goddess argues in its Opposition Brief that Wolox and \nSirvart \u201cacted as one [and] the same party regarding the agreement with [Goddess].\u201d  \n13 D.I. 15 at 4. And it asserts that the companies share executives. Id. at 4\u20135. But God-\ndess cannot raise new facts in a response brief. See Pennsylvania ex rel. Zimmerman \nv. PepsiCo, Inc. , 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988).  \nThe relevant conduct described in the Complaint is almost entirely Wolox\u2019s. \nCompl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  10\u201368. Goddess thus fails to pl ead a plausible link between Sirvart \nand the alleged misconduct. Cf. Rhett v. Salas , 2019 WL 2337445, at *4 (D.N.J. June \n3, 2019);  Pac. Biosciences of Cal., Inc. v. Oxford Nanopore Techs., Inc. , 2019 WL \n1789781, at *2 \u20133 (D. Del. Apr. 24, 2019) (describing a successful alter -egos pleading).  \nSo I dismiss the claims against Sirvart without prejudice.  \nPlus, Goddess wants me to declare the Note between it and Sirvart void. D.I. 1 \n\u00b6 141. It says that \u201cDefendants\u2019 grossly negligent, fraudulent misrepresentations,  and \nwillful and wanton misconduct\u201d induced it to execute the Note. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6  134.  \nBut Goddess is not entitled to declaratory relief absent viable underlying claims. \nSee Shaterian v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , 829 F. Supp. 2d 873, 888 (N.D. Cal. 2011) . \nAnd though some  breach -of-contract claims survive against Wolox, none survive s \nagainst  Sirvart , the holder of the Note. So I do not grant Goddess declaratory relief.  \n* * * * * \nGoddess hired Wolox  to develop early versions of its app. Development was disas-\ntrous . So Goddess\u2019s lawsuit can proceed on the claims that Wolox failed to produce a \nten- or 500 -product version  of the app and that it  deviated from the SCRUM method.  \nBut Goddess\u2019s other claims f ail. I dismiss its professional -negligence  claim with \nprejudice. The rest  I dismiss without prejudice.   "}
