IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPlaintiff; \nCivil Action No. 20-881-RGA \nACCUDATA SOLUTIONS, INC. and ASPIRE \nHEALTH SCIENCE, LLC, \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nMatthew P. Denn, DLA PIPER LLP, Wilmington, DE; Christopher Oprison, DLA PIPER LLP, \nMiami, FL; \nAttorneys for Plaintiff. \nBlake Rohrbacher, Kelly E. Farnan, Valerie A. Caras, RICHARDS, LAYTON & FINGER, P.A., \nWilmington, DE; Daniel L. Buchholz, HOLLAND & KNIGHT LLP, Tampa, FL; \nAttorneys for Defendant Aspire Health Science, LLC. \nFebruary 28, 2022 \n1 * ,S. ISTRICT JUDGE: \nBefore me is Plaintiff Hemostemix's motion to dismiss Defendant Aspire's counterclaim. \n(D.1. 78). I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.1. 79, 80, 82). For the following reasons, \nHemostemix's motion is GRANTED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nHemostemix is a biotechnology company seeking to bring ACT-01, an autologous stem \ncell therapy, to market. (D.I. 36 ,r,r 8, 12). Hemostemix hired Aspire, the intervening defendant \nand counterclaimant , to perform the clinical trials. (Id. ,r 44). Both Hemostemix and Aspire \ncontracted with the other Defendant, Accudata, to perform statistical analysis of the clinical trial \ndata. (D.I. 36 ,r,r 66-67; D.I. 70 (\"Counterclaim\") ,r 12). The clinical trial reached its midpoint \nand Accudata analyzed the data in a Midpoint Analysis. (D.1. 36 ,r,r 62, 79). Hemostemix \nbrought the present suit to obtain the data and the Midpoint Analysis from Accudata. (D.I. 36 ,r,r \n131-39). Aspire intervened. (D.1. 23, 38). On July 21, 2020, I ordered that the data and \nMidpoint Analysis be preserved pending litigation. (D.I. 30). \nAspire' s counterclaim accuses Hemostemix of tortious interference with the Aspire\u00ad\nAccudata Contractor Agreement. (Counterclaim ,r,r 27-34). Section 10 of the Aspire-Accudata \nContractor Agreement states, \"[Accudata] shall not retain any copies [of the clinical trial data] \nwithout the proper written permission of [Aspire].\" (D.1. 24-2, Ex.Cat 3). In June 2020, \nHemostemix demanded that Accudata turn over the clinical trial data and the Midpoint Analysis \nto Hemostemix. (Counterclaim ,r 21).1 Accudata refused. (Id. ,r 24). Subsequently, on an \n1 The Counterclaims are not as precise as Hemostemix's Amended Complaint in identifying the \ndates of the relevant events. Hemostemix says it asked for the Midpoint Analysis on June 15, \n2020, again on June 17th, and through counsel on June 19th, but Accudata refused to provide it. \n(D.I. 36 ,r,r 78, 82, 91). \n2 unspecified date, Aspire demanded that Accudata destroy or return the clinical trial data to \nAspire. (Id. ,r 23). Accudata again refused. (Id.). Aspire alleges that Hemostemix's demand for \nthe clinical trial data caused Accudata to refuse Aspire' s request in breach of the Aspire\u00ad\nAccudata Contractor Agreement. (Id. ,r 31). On June 29, 2020, Hemostemix sued Accudata. \n(D.I. 1). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6), the Court must accept the complaint's factual allegations as true. See Bell At/. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not \nhave to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, conclusions, or a \"formulaic \nrecitation\" of the claim elements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint \nare true (even if doubtful in fact).\"). There must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially \nplausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility \nstandard is satisfied when the complaint's factual content \"allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. (\"Where a \ncomplaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the \nline between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \nTo state a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, \"There must be (1) a \ncontract, (2) about which defendant knew and (3) an intentional act that is a significant factor in \ncausing the breach of such contract (4) without justification (5) which causes injury.\" Irwin & \n3 Leighton, Inc. v. WM Anderson Co., 532 A.2d 983,992 (Del. Ch. 1987) (citing Restatement \n(Second) of Torts\u00a7 766 (1979)).2 \nIII. DISCUSSION \nHemostemix argues that Aspire has failed to plead lack of justification or injury. (D.I. \n79). I agree. \nA. Lack of Justification \nTortious interference requires that the interference be without justification. Aspire's \ncounterclaim alleges the following conduct is \"unjustifiabl[ e ]\" \n\u2022 \"directing and instructing Accudata to breach its contractual obligations\" \n\u2022 \"making false statements concerning Aspire and the Amended License Agreement\" \n\u2022 \"misrepresenting the enforceability of the Aspire-Accudata Contractor Agreement and \nthe Hemostemix-Accudata Consulting Agreement\" \n\u2022 \"filing claims against Aspire and Accudata\" \n(Counterclaim 1 31 ). In addition to these allegations in Aspire' s counterclaim, I can consider \ndocuments integral to those allegations. Mele v. Fed. Rsrv. Bank of New York, 359 F.3d 251,256 \nn.5 (3d Cir. 2004). The Hemostemix-Accudata Consulting Agreement requires Accudata to \ndeliver \"Confidential Information,\" as defined by the contract, to Hemostemix. (D.I. 36-1, Ex. A \n16). \"Confidential Information\" is defined as: \n2 I think the Delaware Supreme Court's holding in connection with the elements of the offense \nfor the analogous tort of tortious interference with prospective business opportunities has the \n\"without justification\" element, although stated differently: \nA \"showing of deliberate interference with a prospective business opportunity requires \n(a) the reasonable probability of a business opportunity, (b) the intentional interference \nby defendant with that opportunity, ( c) proximate causation, and ( d) damages, all of \nwhich must be considered in light of a defendant's privilege to compete or protect his \nbusiness interests in a fair and lawful manner.\" \nDeBonaventura v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 428 A.2d 1151, 1153 (Del. 1981) \n4 [A]ny non-public information that relates to the actual or anticipated business and/or \nproducts, research or development of the Company (Hemostemix], its affiliates or \nsubsidiaries, or to the Company's , it affiliates' or subsidiaries' technical data .... \n(Id. , 3(A)). The \"Amended and Restated License Agreement\" between Hemostemix and Aspire \ncontains a provision requiring Aspire to \"provide [Hemostemix] with full access to all \ninformation in its possession or control relating to any clinical trials ... within thirty (30) \nworking days ofreceiving a request for such access.\" (D.I. 24-1, Ex. B, 6.5). \nHemostemix asks me to find their actions justified \"[b ]ased solely on the unequivocal \nlanguage in the contracts incorporated in the pleadings .\" (D.I. 79 at 15). While normally \njustification is a fact-intensive inquiry, under these unusual circumstances, I agree with \nHemostemix. \nAspire has pled no facts that can support the element of lack of justification. The facts \npled by Aspire, considered in light of the contracts themselves, establish that Hemostemix took \nthe actions a party normally takes when faced with what it feels is a breach of contract. In this \ncase, there are conflicting agreements and conflicting claims to the data. Hemostemix asserted \nits rights based on a facially reasonable interpretation of the contracts at issue. The contracts \nthemselves confirm that Hemostemix's claims are not baseless. As Hemostemix argues, \"both \nAspire and Accudata have express contractual responsibilities to provide the clinical trial data to \nHemostemix on demand: Aspire's obligations arise under the Amended and Restated License \nAgreement; Accudata's obligation arises under the Hemostemix-Accudata consulting \nagreement.\" (D.I. 82 at 7 (citations omitted)). \nTo be sure, these contracts are contested by the parties. At this stage, I am not resolving \nthe merits of the parties' claims. The question is whether Aspire has stated a claim that \nHemostemix acted without justification. \n5 Hemostemix argues that its actions fall under the good faith defense to tortious \ninterference . (D.I. 79 at 13). Defenses are normally not considered on a motion to dismiss, but \n\"an affirmative defense may be raised on a 12(b) (6) motion if the predicate establishing the \ndefense is apparent from the face of the complaint.\" Bethel v. Jendoco Const. Corp., 570 F.2d \n1168, 1174 n.10 (3d Cir. 1978) ( considering a statute of limitations defense); see also Leveto v. \nLapina, 258 F.3d 156, 161 (3d Cir. 2001) (noting that the affirmative defense of qualified \nimmunity \"will be upheld on a 12(b)(6) motion only when the immunity is established on the \nface of the complaint.\" (quotations omitted)) . In this case, the elements of the claim require the \nAspire to plead that Hemostemix's actions were \"without justification.\" Thus, while the good \nfaith defense, as enumerated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts\u00a7 773, is somewhat analogous \nto the issue of whether Aspire has alleged that Hemostemix acted without justification, my \nanalysis rests upon the elements of the claim itself. \nDelaware follows Section 773 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which provides a \ndefense to tortious interference claims. Redbox Automated Retail LLC v. Universal City Studios \nLLLP, 2009 WL 2588748, at* 6 (D. Del. Aug. 17, 2009). Under the Restatement, \nOne who, by asserting in good faith a legally protected interest of his own or threatening \nin good faith to protect the interest by appropriate means, intentionally causes a third \nperson not to perform an existing contract or enter into a prospective contractual relation \nwith another does not interfere improperly with the other's relation if the actor believes \nthat his interest may otherwise be impaired or destroyed by the performance of the \ncontract or transaction. \nRestatement (Second) of Torts\u00a7 773. \nIn this case, Hemostemix has an interest in the clinical trial data and Midpoint Analysis \nunder its contracts with Accudata and Aspire. Aspire argues that Hemostemix has failed to show \nthat it acted using \"appropriate means,\" as required by Section 773. (D.I. 80 at 7). For instance, \nthe counterclaim alleges that Hemostemix misrepresented the enforceability of the contracts. \n6 (Counterclaim ,r,r 22, 31 ). Hemostemix responds, \"Hemostemix sending Accudata a letter \ndemanding that it comply with its contractual obligations is, as a matter of law, protected by the \n'assertion of bona fide claim' defense.\" (D.I. 82 at 8). Hemostemix analogizes to the first \nillustration of Section 773: \nA enters into a contract to buy Blackacre from B. C honestly believes that he has a right \nof way over Blackacre. With knowledge of the contract, C in good faith informs A of his \ninterest and threatens to enforce it by legal proceedings if, as and when the owner of \nBlackacre should deny his claim. A thereupon refuses to perform his contract with B. C's \ninterference is not improper under the rule stated in this Section. \nHere, Aspire contracted with Accudata to analyze the clinical trial data and perform a Midpoint \nAnalysis. Hemostemix believed it had a right to the data and Midpoint Analysis under its \ncontract with Accudata. When Accudata refused to deliver the data to Hemostemi x, \nHemostemix demanded delivery under the contract, threatened to sue, and then did sue. \nThe facts Aspire has pied merely reflect assertion of a legal claim. The contracts \nthemselves suggest that the claim was made in good faith. Aspire's allegations of \nmisrepresentation are conclusory and insufficient to plausibly show that Hemostemix used \nimproper means. Thus, I find that Aspire has failed to plead that Hemostemix acted without \njustification . \nB. Injury \nHemostemix also argues that Aspire has failed to show injury. Aspire's counterclaim \ndescribes its injury as the breach of contract itself: \nAs a direct and proximate result of Hemostemix 's intentional and unjustified interference, \nAccudata breached the Aspire-Accudata Contractor Agreement by, for example, failing \nto not retain copies of the documents provided by Aspire, including the clinical trial data \nand the Midpoint Analysis pursuant to the Aspire-Accudata Contractor Agreement. \n(Counterclaim ,r 33). \n7 Aspire claims that contractual breach is \"a legally recognized injury for a tortious \ninterference claim.\" (D.I. 80 at 5). In support, Aspire cites eCommerce Indus., Inc. v. MW A \nIntelligence , Inc., 2013 WL 5621678, at *50 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2013). I do not think \neCommerce supports Aspire's position. The eCommerce court simply described tortious \ninterference damages as a confluence of contracts and torts damages: \nThe traditional measure of damages is that which is utilized in connection with an award \nof compensatory damages, whose purpose is to compensate a plaintiff for its proven, \nactual loss caused by the defendant 's wrongful conduct. In contract, the remedy is \ncalculated to compensate the non-breaching party for the loss of the benefits of its \nbargain (i.e., the benefit it would have received had the contract been performed) . In tort, \nthe remedy is calculated to make the injured party whole, by compensating it for the harm \nsuffered due to the tortfeasor's wrongful act. In a tortious interference with contract case, \nthese two measures of damages might coincide, as the harm suffered by the tort victim \ndue to the tortfeasor' s wrongful act is often the loss of the benefits of its bargain. \nId. at 50 (citations omitted). This confirms that damages are compensatory. As Hemostemi x \npoints out, the eCommerc e \"claimant had actually suffered a loss in the form of lost profits.\" \n(D.I. 82 at 5). Aspire has not produced a single tortious interference case where the sole injury \nwas a contractual breach absent compensatory damages. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \ntalks about liability \"for the pecuniary loss resulting\" from failure to perform the contract. \u00a7 766. \nThe comments confirm, \"The cause of action is for pecuniary loss resulting from the \ninterference .\" \u00a7 766 cmt. t. \nBreach and injury are separate elements; Aspire must plead both to state a claim. See \nGoldman v. Pogo.com, Inc., 2002 WL 1358760, at *8 (Del. Ch. June 14, 2002) (\"A claim of \ntortious interference with a contractual right requires, inter alia, a contract, a breach of that \ncontract, and an injury.\"). Here, Aspire has pled neither loss nor injury. Aspire has the data and \nthe Midpoint Analysis. Aspire has not pled pecuniary injury flowing from Accudata's retention \nof that data, which has been court-ordered since July 21, 2020. \n8 In its briefing, Aspire also asserts that litigation costs are a form of injury. (D.I. 80 at 5). \nHemostemix replies, \"To allow a party to file a claim for tortious interference with contract, and \ncite as its only injury the cost of filing the claim, would effectively eliminate that element of the \ntort.\" (D.I. 82 at 5). I agree with Hemostemix. The injury cannot be litigation costs in the very \naction the tortious interference claim is filed. \nThus, I find that Aspire has failed to plead an injury, which is fatal to its tortious \ninterference claim. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n9 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nHEMOSTEMIX INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nACCUDATA SOLUTIONS, INC. \nASPIRE HEALTH SCIENCE, LLC, \nDefendants .
