Pro se Petitioner.  \n  \n \n \n \n         September  23, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware  \n  /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \n Petitioner Leon Powell is proceeding pro se  with a petition for federal habeas relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d).  (D.I. 2)  On July 6, 2022, the Court entered a \nMemorandum and Order directing Petitioner to show cause why his Petition should not be \ndismissed as time- barred , (D.I. 5; D.I. 6) , to which Petitioner responded (D.I. 7).  For the \nfollowing reasons, the Court will dismiss the Petition as time -barred without issuing a certificate \nof appealability.   \nI.  BACKGROUND  \nIn 1983, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of first degree murder, and \nthe Superior Court sentenced him to a mandatory life term.  (D.I. 2 at 1)  The Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions and sentence on September 23, 1983.  See Powell v. State , 474 A.2d 141 (Table), 1983 WL 162313 (Del. Sept. 27, 1983). \nIn 2014, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court his first motion for post -\nconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d).  See State v. Powell , 2014 WL 6662926, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Nov. 24, 2014).  The Rule 61 motion \nraised the following four grounds for relief: (1) Petitioner was indicted under the wrong statute; (2) he was improperly convicted of felony murder because he  was not convicted of any \nunderlying felony; (3) the trial court abused its discretion by permitting defense counsel to have a private polygraph examination administered to Petitioner; and (4) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by misleading the  trial court to permit him to undergo a private \npolygraph examination.  See id . at *1.  On November 24, 2014, the Superior Court denied the \nRule 61 motion as time -barred because it was filed more than thirty years after Petitioner\u2019s \nconviction became final .  Id.  Petitioner appealed.  On January 16, 2015, the Delaware Supreme 2 \n Court remanded the Rule 61 motion to the Superior Court for decision.  See Powell v. State , 2015 \nWL 1242897, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 16, 2015).  On remand, the Superior Court denie d \nPetitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion as time -barred under Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule \n61(i)(1) and, alternatively, as meritless.  See i d. at *2- 5.  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed \nthat decision on June 17, 2015.  See Powell v. State , 116 A.3d 1244 (Table), 2015 WL 3824781, \nat *2 (Del. June 17, 2015).   \nOn January 21, 2020, Petitioner filed a second Rul e 61 motion asserting two claims: (1) \nhe wa s not charged with possession of a deadly weapon in commission of a felony and, \ntherefore, could not have had the requisite  \u201cmalice\u201d for felony murder ; and (2) the jury should \nhave been instructed on reasonable doubt.  See State v. Powell , 2020 WL 836607, at *1 (Del. \nSuper. Ct. Feb. 19, 2020).  A Delaware Superior Court Commissioner recommended summarily \ndismissing the Rule 61 motion as successive under Rule 61(d)(2 ).  See id .  The Superior Court \nadopted the Commissioner\u2019s Report and Recommendation on May 25, 2020 and denied \nPetitioner\u2019s second Rule 61 motion as successive.  See Powell v. State , 275 A.3d 267 (Table), \n2022 WL 905876, at *1 (Del. Mar. 28, 2022). On April 16, 2021, Petitioner filed a motion for \nreconsideration of the denial of his second Rule 6 1 motion, followed by a Rule 35(a) motion for \ncorrection of sentence on June 28, 2021.  See id . at *2.  The Superior Court denied both motions \non September 22, 2021.  Id . The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on March 28, \n2022.  See id . at *2- 3. \nPetitioner filed the instant Petition on May 17, 2022.  (D.I.  2)  The Petition challenges \nPetitioner\u2019s 1983 conviction for felony murder .  On July 6, 2022, the Court entered a 3 \n Memorandum and Order directing Petitioner to show cause why his Petition should not be \ndismissed as time- barred.  (D.I. 7; D.I. 8)  Petitioner filed a Response .  (D.I. 7)   \nII.   LEGAL STANDARD   \n Pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, the  Court is required to \npreliminarily review a petitioner's habeas petition and determine whether it \u201cplainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d  Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.  Pursuant to this Rule, a district court is \u201cauthorized to dismiss summarily \nany habeas petition that appears legally insufficient on its face.\u201d  McFarland v. Scott , 512 U.S. \n849, 856 (1994). III. DISCUSSION  \nAs the Court previously explained in its Memorandum and Order t o Show Cause, the \ninstant Petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, and is subject to AEDPA\u2019s one -year period of limitation.  (D.I. 5 \nat 3-4)  AEDPA\u2019s limitations period may be statutorily and equitably tolled, and a petitioner may \nalso avoid being time -barred by establishing a gateway claim of actual innocence.    \nHere, Petitioner filed the instant Petition more than twenty -five years too late and none of \nPetitioner\u2019s previously- filed state motions for collateral relief statutorily toll the limitations \nperiod.  ( See D.I. 5 at 4)  In his Response to the Court\u2019s show cause order, Petitioner asserts  an \nargument for equitable tolling and also contends that he is actually in nocent.  \nA. Equitable Tolling  \nEquitable tolling is only appropriate in rare circumstances when the petitioner \ndemonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary 4 \n circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely  filing.\u201d  Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, \n649-50 (2010).  With respect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the \nlate filing is due to the petitioner\u2019s excusable neglect.   Id. at 651- 52.  As for the extraordinary \ncircumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether the circ umstance alleged to be \nextraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to \nmeeting AEDPA\u2019s one -year deadline.\u201d  Pabon v. Mahanoy , 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011).  \nAn extraordinary circumstance will only warran t equitable tolling if there is \u201ca causal \nconnection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner\u2019s failure to \nfile a timely federal petition.\u201d  Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013).  Specifically, \n\u201cif the person seek ing equitable  tolling  has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to \nfile after the extraordinary  circumstances began, the link of causation between the extraordinary  \ncircumstances and the failure to file is broken, and the extraordinary circumsta nces therefore did \nnot prevent  timely filing.\u201d Brown v. Shannon, 322 F.3d 768, 773 (3d Cir. 2003).  The burden is \non the petitioner to prove that he has been reasonably diligent in pursuing his rights. See Urcinoli \nv. Cathel, 546 F.3d 269, 277 (3d Cir. 2008). \nThe instant Petition challenges Petitioner\u2019s 1983 conviction for f irst degree murder and \nasserts two grounds for relief: (1) the Delaware courts committed plain error by convicting him \npursuant to an insufficient indictment; and (2) Petitioner was denied access to the Courts.  (D.I. 2 at 5-7)  In his Response  to the Court\u2019s show ca use Order , Petitioner appears to argue that \nequitable tolling is warranted because  defense counsel did not present the se two Claims to the \nDelaware Supreme Court during his direct appeal.  (D.I. 7 at 3)   5 \n The Delaware Supreme Court decided Petitioner\u2019s dir ect appeal on September 23, 1983.  \nEven if the Court were to accept Petitioner\u2019s argument that defense counsel provided ineffective \nassistance during his 19 83 direct appeal (which it does not), counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective \nassistance in 19 83 does not expl ain why Petitioner waited until 20 22 to raise the two grounds for \nrelief  in the instant Petition.  In other words, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he pursued \nhis claims with the requisite amount of reasonable diligence necessary to justify equita ble tolling.  \nThus, equitable tolling is not warranted in this case.   \nB.  Gateway Claim of Actual Innocence  \nA credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable exception\u201d that can \novercome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one -year limitations period.  See McQuiggin v. Perkins , 569 U.S \n383, 392 (2013); Wallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F. 4th 133, 150- 51 (3d Cir. 2021).  A pet itioner satisfies \nthe actual innocence exception by (1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his innocence; and (2) \nshowing \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that \u201ca reasonable juror would have reasonable \ndoubt about his guilt[] in light of the new evidence.\u201d   Wallace , 2 F.4th at 151.  \u201cActual innocence \nmeans factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u201d  Bousley v. United States , 523 U.S. 614, \n623 (1998).  \nHere, Petitioner contends that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d because he was convicted of first \ndegree murder without having been charged with a weapons offense.  (D.I. 7 at 3)  This is not a \nclaim of factual  innocence.  (And, to the extent it is interpreted as a claim of legal  innocence , it \nis clearly frivolous.). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s instant assert ion of innocence does not constitute a \ncredible gateway claim capable of overcoming AEDPA\u2019s time- bar.  \nAccordingly , the Court will dismiss the Petition as time -barred.  6 \n IV.  CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY  \n A district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether \nto issue a certificate of appealability.  See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).  \nWhen a district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of t he denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was \ncorrect in its procedural ruling.  See Slack v. McDaniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).   \n The Court concludes that the instant Petition is time -barred .  In the Court\u2019s view, \nreasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable.  Therefore , the Court will not \nissue a certificate of appealability.  \nV. CONCLUSION \n For the reasons discussed, the Court will dismiss the Petition as time -barred .  \nAdditionally, the Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability .  An appropriate Order will \nbe entered."}
