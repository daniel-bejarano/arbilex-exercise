(D.I. 1 ,r 2). I held a three-day bench trial from September 19 to September \n21, 2022. The parties narrowed the issues to invalidity for obviousness of each of six asserted \nclaims from five remaining patents. \nThe asserted patents fall into two groups, each of which shares a substantively identical \nspecification. (D.I. 89-1 ,r,r 10, 21). One group consists of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,763,933 (\"the \nMannion '933 patent\"), 9,775,808 (\"the '808 patent\"), and 9,763,886 (\"the '886 patent\"). The \nparties refer to these patents as the \"Tamper Resistant \" or \"Abuse-Deterrent Patents.\" I refer to \nthem as the \"Abuse-Deterrent Patents.\" The claims at issue are claim 3 of the Mannion '933 \npatent, claim 3 of the '808 patent, and claim 6 of the '886 patent. \nThe second group consists of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,073,933 (\"the '933 patent\") and \n9,522,919 (\"the '919 patent\"). The parties (and I) refer to these as the \"Low ABUK Patents.\" The \nclaims of the \"Low ABUK Patents\" at issue are claims 3 and 11 of the '933 patent and claim 21 \nof the '919 patent. \nFor the following reasons, I find all six of the asserted claims invalid for obviousness \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPurdue holds New Drug Application (\"NDA\") No. 022272 for OxyContin (oxycodone \nhydrochloride). OxyContin is an extended-release analgesic . (D.I. 89-1 ,r 32). The Abuse\u00ad\nDeterrent Patents relate to an abuse-deterrent reformulation of OxyContin that make it hard \nenough to resist crushing and viscous enough to deter intravenous users. (D.I. 106 at 3, 5). The \n2 reformulation was approved in 2010, and the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved \nan abuse-deterrent label for the reformulation in 2013, following postmarketing studies. (D .I. 107 \n120). I will refer to the pre-reformulation version of OxyContin as \"Original OxyContin. \" \nThe Low-AB UK Patents relate to compositions of oxycodone containing 8a-14-\ndihydroxy- 7,8-dihydrocodeinone (\"8a\") and having particularly low levels of the impurity 14-\nhydroxycodeinone (\"14-hydroxy\"). (Id 1148-49). 14-hydroxy is an alpha beta unsaturated \nketone (\"ABUK\") , a class of compounds thought to be genotoxic . The evolution of the scientific \nunderstanding of these compounds ' genotoxicity is a factual issue in this case. (D.I. 1001 158). \nAccord submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") No. 213564 for \napproval to market a generic version of OxyContin. Plaintiffs then initiated this lawsuit. (D.I. 1 \n111-2). The Mannion '933, '808, '933, and '919 patents are all listed in the FDA's Orange Book \nfor OxyContin. The '886 patent is not. (Id 11). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nA patent claim is invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 \"if the differences between \nthe claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have \nbeen obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary \nskill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103; see also KSR Int'! Co. \nv. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406-07 (2007). \"As patents are presumed valid, a defendant bears \nthe burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.\" Shire, LLC v. Amneal \nPharms., LLC, 802 F.3d 1301, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (citations omitted). \"Under\u00a7 103, the scope \nand content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims \nat issue are to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against \n3 this background , the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined.\" KSR, \n550 U.S. at 406 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \nA court is required to consider secondary considerations , or objective indicia of \nnonobviousness , before reaching an obviousness determination , as a \"check against hindsight \nbias.\" See In re Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsule Patent Litig., 676 \nF.3d 1063, 1078-79 (Fed. Cir. 2012). \"Such secondary considerations as commercial success, \nlong felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the \ncircumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented.\" Graham v. \nJohn Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966). \nIII. THE ABUSE-DETERRENT PA TENTS \nA. The Asserted Claims \nThe claims at issue are claim 3 of the Mannion '933 patent, claim 3 of the '808 patent, \nand claim 6 of the '886 patent.

A method according to claim 5, wherein the curing temperature is from about 65\u00b0 \nC. to about 90\u00b0 C. and the curing time is from about 10 minutes to about 10 hours. \n('886 patent at 171 :35-172:22, 172:26-32). \nB. Findings of Fact \n1. Both Original OxyContin and the reformulation that the Abuse-Deterrent Patents \nconcern are extended-release matrix tablets. (Tr. at 204:16-21;1 '886 Patent at \n171 :42-50). Matrix tablets contain an active ingredient embedded in a polymer \nmatrix. (Tr. at 202:23-203 :9) \n2. Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is among the most commonly used matrix polymers . \n(Tr. at 204:6-8). \n3. With respect to the Abuse-Deterrent Patents, a person of ordinary skill in the art \n(\"POSA\") has an advanced degree and substantial experience drawn from the \nfields of medicine , chemical engineering, polymers, pharmaceutical sciences, \npharmaceutics , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacology. (D.I. 89-1 at ,r 134). \n1 The transcript is available at D.I. 102-105. It is consecutively paginated. \n6 4. The Abuse-Deterrent Patents are directed to compositions and methods of \nproducing abuse-deterrent pharmaceutical formulations. (D.I. 89-1 ,r,r 21-22). \n5. For purposes of this action, the priority date of the patents is August 25, 2006. \n(D.I. 89-1 ,r,r 24, 27, 30). \n6. Abuse by crushing was a known issue with OxyContin. (DTX-008). \n7. United States Patent No. 6,488,963 to McGinity (\"McGinity\") is prior art to the \nAbuse-Deterrent Patents under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). (D.I. 89-1 ,r 120). \n8. A POSA would have understood that, because McGinity's tablets were made \nfrom melted PEO, they had increased breaking strength that provided resistance to \ncrushing. (Tr. at 220:17-26). \n9. McGinity teaches that its formulations can be used on \"analgesics\" (DTX-009 at \n6: 10), which a POSA would understand includes oxycodone . (Tr. at 220:7-16). \n10. McGinity teaches melting PEO in a hot-melt extruder to create hardened tablets. \n(DTX-009 at 8:8-28). At the time of the invention , hot melt extruders, though \nknown, were not common. (Tr. at 219:3-13). They could be used at contract \nmanufacturers. (Tr. at 257:17-19). \n11. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0031546 (\"Bartholomaus\") is prior art to the \nAbuse-Deterrent Patents under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). (DTX-010; D.I. 89-1 ,r 123). \n12. Bartholomaus teaches pressing PEO tablets in a \"heating cabinet.\" (DTX-010 at \n[0117]). A POSA would understand that the purpose of the heating was to melt \nthe PEO. (Tr. at 227:5-13). \n13. The method disclosed in the examples in Bartholomaus was not scalable. (Tr. at \n226:7-26, 332:5-24). \n14. Bartholomaus contemplates pressing tablets and heating them as separate steps. \n(Tr. at 227:20-228:4; DTX-010 at [0067]). \n15. Zezhi J.

Dev. and Tech. 2, 257 (2001) (\"Shao\") is \nprior art to the Tamper Resistant Patents under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). (D.I. 89-1 ,r \n126). Shao discloses matrix tablets made with the polymer Kollidon-SR \n(polyvinylacetate-povidone). (DTX-011 at 0001). \n16. Nashiru Billa et al., Diclofenac Release from Eudragit-Containing Matrices and \nEffects of Thermal Treatment , 24 Drug Dev. and Indus.

Billa discloses matrix tablets made with the polymer \n7 EUDRAGIT (ethyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymer). (DTX-012 at \n0002). \n17. Marcelo 0. Omelczuk & James W. McGinity, The Influence ofThermal \nTreatment on the Physical-Mechanical Properties of Tablets Containing Poly(DL\u00ad\nLactic Acid), 10 Phann. Rsch. 4, 542 (1992) (\"Omelczuk;\" together with Billa and \nShao, the \"Oven Art\") is prior art to the Tamper Resistant Patents under 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 102(b). (D.I. 89-11128). Omelczuk discloses matrix tablets made with the \npolymer PLA (poly(DL-lactic acid)). (DTX-014 at 0001). \n18. The Oven Art teaches heating various non-PEO polymers in ovens (Tr. at 229:20-\n25, 231: 11-22, 232: 1-11 ), though not to their melting points. (Tr. at 286:5-14 , \n287:6-8). \n19. Shao concluded that the curing process increased the hardness of the tablets. \n(DTX-011 at 0005; Tr. at 230:9-20). \n20. Both Bartholomaus and the Oven Art disclose cooling and hardening the tablet. \n(Tr. at 240:8-11). \nC. Conclusions of Law \nAs a preliminary matter, the parties treat the three asserted Abuse-Deterrent claims as \nthough they rise and fall together. Neither party contends that their arguments or my analysis \nshould apply differently to the product-by-process than to the method claims. Therefore, I too \nwill treat the three claims together. For the following reasons, I conclude that each of the three \nclaims is invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. \nDefendant relies on five pieces of prior art in arguing for the obviousness of the Abuse\u00ad\nDeterrent Patents. Bartholomaus and McGinity broadly teach PEO matrix tablets formed with \nsimultaneous compression and heating. The three Oven Art references broadly teach curing non\u00ad\nPEO matrix tablets in ovens after compression. The parties generally agree on two ways in which \nthe Abuse-Deterrent Patents depart from the prior art. First, the prior art that used PEO \n(Bartholomaus and McGinity) taught simultaneous compression and heating (D.I. 99 at 5; D.I. \n106 at 7), while the prior art that taught sequential compression and heating (the Oven Art) used \npolymers other than PEO. (D.I. 99 at 10-11; D.I. 106 at 13). The parties disagree about whether a \n8 POSA would have been motivated to make PEO tablets with sequential compression and \nheating, and whether there would have been a reasonable expectation of success in doing so. \nSecond, no prior art used the same combinations of curing time and temperature ranges as those \ndisclosed in the Abuse-Deterrent Patents. (D.I. 99 at 6; D.I. 106 at 13). The parties disagree \nabout whether routine experimentation by a POSA would have yielded the times and \ntemperatures disclosed in the patents. I focus in turn on each difference between the asserted \nclaims and the prior art, though some of the parties' arguments are common to both. \n1. Sequential Compression and Heating \nThe first gap between the Abuse-Deterrent Patents and the prior art can be bridged by \ncombining the PEO tablets of Bartholomaus and McGinity with the heating techniques taught in \nthe Oven Art. With all elements of the claim present in the prior art, \"[a] party seeking to \ninvalidate a patent on the basis of obviousness must 'demonstrate by clear and convincing \nevidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior \nart references to achieve the claimed invention , and that the skilled artisan would have had a \nreasonable expectation of success in doing so.\"' Kinetic Concept, Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., \n688 F.3d 1342, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharm, USA, Inc., \n566 F.3d 989, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). \na. Motivation to Combine \nIn arguing for a POSA's motivation to combine the prior art, Defendant asserts that a \nPOSA would look to Bartholomaus and McGinity in the first place because abuse by crushing \nwas a known problem. (D.I. 99 at 7-8). A POSA would then seek to modify Bartholomaus and \nMcGinity because the processes disclosed in those references would not have been suitable for \nlarge-scale production. (Id. at 13). For example, Defendant 's expert, Dr. Leah Appel, testified \n9 that the Bartholomaus method applies heat by placing a tablet press in a heated chamber, but \nscaling this to produce many tablets at once would require a large space heated to a high \ntemperature-and it is unclear how one would operate a tablet press in those conditions. (Tr. at \n226: 1-18). Dr. Appel also testified that the hot melt extruders used in McGinity were \"niche\" at \nthe time of invention-they were available at some facilities , but access to one was not a given. \n(Id. at 219:3-13). Researchers might have to contract with other companies in order to use one. \n(Id. at 258:8-16). Dr. Appel testified that ovens, by contrast, were a common and readily \naccessible tool for heating tablets. (Id. at 219: 14-19). Defendant argues that a POSA would \ntherefore naturally turn to ovens in either scaling up Bartholomaus or adapting McGinity to more \ncommonly available equipment. The Oven Art would have provided guidance for a POSA on \nhow to cure matrix tablets in an oven, leading to the claimed invention. 2 \nPlaintiffs respond with several critiques of Dr. Appel's analysis. First, Plaintiffs argue \nthat a POSA presented with Bartholomaus and McGinity would not have a motivation to modify \nthose references , because each of those references discloses an effective crush-resistant tablet. \n(D.I. 106 at 10). As to McGinity , Plaintiffs also challenge the idea that hot-melt extruders were \nniche, arguing that they were available at certain facilities that could be contracted with. (Id. at \n8). Second, Plaintiffs assert that even if a POSA sought to modify Bartholomaus and McGinity , \n2 Defendant also argues-in a footnote-for collateral estoppel on the factual issue of whether \nsimultaneous and sequential heating and compression are equivalent. (D.I. 99 at 14 n.7). In prior \nlitigation , Plaintiffs successfully argued that a sequential heating process infringed, under the \ndoctrine of equivalents , a patent that disclosed simultaneous heating. See In re Oxycontin \nAntitrust Litig., 994 F. Supp. 2d 367,419 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). Plaintiffs respond that this case \ninvolved different patents and products . (D.I. 106 at 9). The application of collateral estoppel \nhere was barely briefed. I think it is extremely unlikely that collateral estoppel applies. Whether \nor not it does, I do not think a factual determination that simultaneous and sequential processes \nare equivalent is necessary for a finding of obviousness. Therefore, I do not address the \napplication of collateral estoppel and disregard the factual findings that Defendant offers in \nfootnotes . the POSA would not have a motivation to combine Bartholomaus and McGinity with the Oven \nArt in particular , because the Oven Art did not use PEO and did not teach heating matrix tablets \nto their polymers ' melting points. (Id. at 13). Third, Plaintiffs argue that a POSA would never \nhave looked to Bartholomaus and McGinity in the first place and would instead have sought to \nadd an antagonist. (Id. at 15). Plaintiffs ' expert, Dr. Bley, testified that the prior art reference \nMansbach \"teaches that antagonists are the way to go and particularly for opioid analgesics ... if \nthere's an antagonist available, that's the preferred path.\" (Tr. at 425:23-25 ; PTX-131 at S 19). \nDr. Bley also testified that he himself, as a POSA in the field at the relevant time, did not pursue \ncrush resistant tablets, characterizing Dr. Appel's analysis as \"hindsight-driven. \" (Id. at 398:16-\n399:14).3 \nOn the first issue of whether a POSA would want to modify Bartholomaus and McGinity , \nthe parties agree that the processes taught by those references successfully produced hardened \ntablets. (D.I. 99 at 11; D.I. 106 at 10). They disagree on how this success relates to the Abuse\u00ad\nDeterrent Patents. Defendant argues that the processes ' viability would make them a good \nstarting point for a POSA trying to develop hardened tablets, while Plaintiffs contend that the \nsuccessful processes would be a POSA's ending point. Plaintiffs ' position fails to address the \ncrux of Defendant 's argument. Defendant is arguing that while the processes were successful for \n\"one-off tablets\" (Tr. at 228:20-229:7) , a POSA would have sought a process that could be \nscaled up. Plaintiffs do not make a plausible argument that a POSA would not want to develop a \nscalable process. Plaintiffs also do not make a plausible argument that a POSA would have \n3 Plaintiffs also argue, in a single paragraph, that the problem of crushable tablets is not a \nsufficient \"known problem\" to support a motivation to modify the prior art. (D.I. 106 at 17). I do \nnot think this is the case, and the briefing on this argument was so summary that I will not \naddress it further. \n11 options other than modifying Bartholomaus and McGinity if they wanted to produce hardened \ntablets at scale. 4 I also do not think the option to contract with third-party research or \nmanufacturing facilities-in the case ofMcGinity 's hot-melt extruders-would negate the \nmotivation to adapt the method to ovens. \nA POSA's \"[m]otivation to combine may be found in many different places and forms.\" \nPar Pharm., Inc. v. TWi Pharms., Inc., 773 F.3d 1186, 1197 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Allergan, \nInc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 726 F.3d 1286, 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2013)). \"[I]t often may be the case that \nmarket demand, rather than scientific literature , will drive design trends.\" KSR, 550 U.S. at 419. I \nthink that a desire to manufacture hardened tablets at scale and with minimal switching costs is a \nmotivation to modify the prior art. Finding otherwise would run the risk of \"[g]ranting patent \nprotection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation,\" which \nKSR cautioned against. Id. Therefore , while it is true that Bartholomaus and McGinity 's \nprocesses resulted in hardened tablets, I find that a POSA would not stop at their teachings. \nPlaintiffs also contend regarding the motivation to modify Bartholomaus and McGinity \nthat \"the claims are not limited to commercial manufacturing. \" (D.I. 106 at 8). However , it is not \nnecessary for commercial manufacturing to be claimed for it to serve as a motivation to combine. \nIn Alcon Research, Ltd. v. Apotex, Inc., the Federal Circuit found that known \"antihistarninic \nefficacy\" would be a valid motivation to combine certain allergy treatment prior art references . \n687 F.3d 1362, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2012). However , the patent at issue claimed the treatment for \nits ability to \"stabiliz[ e] conjunctival mast cells\"-a different allergy treatment mechanism. Id. at \n1363-64. I also note that whether the inventors of the Abuse-Deterrent Patents themselves were \n4 I note that the question of a POSA's options for producing hardened tablets at scale is distinct \nfrom the issue of whether a POSA would want to pursue hardened tablets at all, which I discuss \nbelow. \n12 motivated a desire to produce at a commercial scale is immaterial. The Federal Circuit has \n\"repeatedly held that the motivation to modify a prior art reference to arrive at the claimed \ninvention need not be the same motivation that the patentee had.\" Id. at 1368. \nOverall, I find that Defendant presented clear and convincing evidence of a POSA's \nmotivation to modify Bartholomaus and McGinity. I am convinced by Dr. Appel' s testimony \nthat a POSA would seek a commercially viable process for producing hardened tablets. \nSecond, Plaintiffs argue that even with a motivation to modify Bartholomaus and \nMcGinity , a POSA would not combine them with the Oven Art in particular. I find that Dr. \nAppel presented clear and convincing testimony that ovens were commonly available and used \nto heat tablets. Plaintiffs ' witnesses did not provide any testimony to the contrary. Plaintiffs did \nnot attempt to show, for example, that a POSA would not have access to ovens, or that other \nequipment would be a more natural choice than ovens for heating tablets. \nI do not think Defendant 's theory of obviousness is hampered by the fact that ovens had \nonly been used to heat polymers other than PEO. The Oven Art taught the use of ovens to heat \nmatrix tablets made from several different polymers . (DTX-011 at 0001; DTX-012 at 0002; \nDTX-014 at 0001). Shao specifically taught that the heat curing made its tablets harder. (DTX-\n011 at 0005). It is not much of a leap to infer that ovens would also be useful for applying heat to \nharden the matrix tablets disclosed by Bartholomaus and McGinity. At the very least, in the \nabsence of testimony about other heating tools, employing a commonly available tool to apply \nheat to tablets is obvious to try. See KSR, 550 U.S. at 421. While the Oven Art does not teach \nheating tablets to their melting points, Bartholomaus and McGinity both teach hardening PEO by \nheating it to its melting point. (DTX-009 at 8:8-28; DTX-010 at [0117]). Dr. Appel credibly \n13 testified that a POSA combining these references would seek the same result in an oven. (Tr. at \n233:6-13). \nI turn to Plaintiffs ' third argument , that a POSA would not be motivated to combine \nBartholomaus and McGinity with the Oven Art because adding an antagonist would have been a \nmore obvious path. (D.I. 106 at 17). Plaintiffs offer evidence that OxyContin had approved \nantagonists at the time of the invention (Tr. at 419:8-420:8), and the prior art explicitly taught \nusing an antagonist for abuse deterrence (Tr. at 417:25-419:5). Plaintiffs also offer evidence that \nboth Dr. Bley and Purdue itself first pursued paths other than physical abuse deterrence . (Tr. at \n422:3-25, 304: 18-305 :4). However , a path does not need to be the most obvious or preferred path \nin order to be obvious. \"[C]ase law does not require that a particular combination must be the \npreferred , or the most desirable , combination described in the prior art in order to provide \nmotivation for the current invention.\" In re Fulton, 391 F.3d 1195, 1200 (Fed. Cir. 2004) \n(quoting In re Beattie, 974 F.2d 1309, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). \nDr. Bley's testimony about his own research may support the viability of the antagonist \nroute, but it does not undermine the viability of the hardness route. Plaintiffs do not, as far as I \ncan tell, argue that the prior art taught away from hardened opioid formulations for abuse \ndeterrence-they simply argue that the prior art taught an alternative . I likewise find that the \nMansbach reference on which Plaintiffs rely encourages the use of an antagonist , but does not \nteach away from using physical abuse deterrence . The passage that Dr. Bley discussed at trial, \n(Tr. 425:3-25), says, \"For drugs of abuse without an approved antagonist , countermeasures \nagainst physical tampering may represent the best means to reduce the risk of oral or parenteral \nabuse.\" (PTX-131 at S 19). While this passage certainly suggests that a POSA should pursue \nphysical abuse deterrence for drugs without an approved antagonist , it says nothing about the \n14 inverse of that statement-that a POSA should not use such methods for drugs with an approved \nantagonist. Therefore , I do not find that the prior art discourages physical abuse deterrence and I \nam not persuaded by Plaintiffs ' third argument. \nOverall, through Dr. Appel's testimony , I find Defendant has presented clear and \nconvincing evidence of a motivation to combine Bartholomaus and McGinity with the Oven Art. \nb. Reasonable Expectation of Success \nHaving found a motivation to combine the prior art references , I consider whether a \nPOSA would have had a \"reasonable expectation of success\" in \"achiev[ing] the claimed \ninvention. \" Kinetic Concept, 688 F.3d at 1360. Defendant notes that a POSA would need to \nbalance opposing considerations in arriving at the claimed invention, ensuring that the PEO \nwould harden, the active ingredient would not degrade, and the method would be practical. (D.I. \n99 at 17). Defendant asserts that a POSA would reasonabl y expect there to be an optimal time \nand temperature that balances these considerations , discoverable through routine \nexperimentation. 5 (Id. at 16-17). In general support of its obviousness argument , Defendant also \nnotes that Bartholomaus \"teaches that its formulations can be made using compression followed \nby heating.\" Id. at 10. Specificall y, Defendant points to passages of Bartholomaus that refer to \n\"subsequent exposure to heat.\" (DTX-010 at [0065], [0067]). In fact, Bartholomaus notes, \"In \ndirect tableting with subsequent exposure to heat, the formed tablets are briefly heated at least to \nthe softening temperature ... and cooled again.\" (Id. at [0067]). \n5 This issue relates to both of the differences between the claims and the prior art noted \npreviously . I discuss whether the experimentation would be routine when discussing the second \ndifference of time and temperature ranges. For the purposes of reasonable expectation of success, \nI only ask whether a POSA could reasonabl y expect to make hardened tablets by combining \nBartholomaus and McGinity at the claimed times and temperatures . \n15 Plaintiffs argue that there could not have been a reasonable expectation of success in \narriving at the claimed invention. Plaintiffs criticize Dr. Appel's testimony as conclusory (D.I. \n106 at 18) and the passages about subsequent exposure to heat from Bartholomaus as \"generic.\" \n(Id. at 8-9). Plaintiffs point to testimony by Dr. Richard Mannion , a named inventor on each of \nthe Abuse-Deterrent Patents, that he had reasons to doubt that the method would work. (Id. at \n19). Specificall y, Dr. Mannion testified that heating the tablets without compression might cause \nthem to change shape or stick together. (Tr. at 320:1-18 ).6 Plaintiffs also note that Dr. Appel's \ntrial demonstrative does not suggest the same time and temperature ranges disclosed in the \npatent. They argue that this indicates that a POSA could not have reasonabl y expected success. \n(D.I. 106 at 19-20). \n\"Obviousness does not require absolute predictability of success ... all that is required is \na reasonable expectation of success.\" In re O 'Farrell, 853 F.2d 894, 903-04 (Fed. Cir. 1988). I \nthink there is a reasonable expectation of success in producing a hardened tablet from sequential \ncompression and then heating of PEO. I am persuaded by Dr. Appel's testimony that a POSA \nwould understand that applying heat to melt PEO would cause it to harden. I think a POSA could \nreasonably expect similar success by simply changing the heating tool. \nI also find that Bartholomaus 's discussion of subsequent exposure to heat contributes to a \nreasonable expectation of success-a POSA would expect , upon reading Bartholomaus , to be \nable to achieve similar results with other heating methods. The statement in Bartholomaus is \n6 Dr. Mannion also testified more generally about challenges associated with PEO tablets, \nincluding achieving the same extended release profile as original OxyContin (Tr. at 308: 16-25) \nand abuse by hot water extraction . (Tr. at 310: 12-311 :7). I do not treat this testimony as part of \nthe reasonable expectation of success analysis because it does not relate to claimed aspects of the \ninvention. The patents do not claim a particular extended release profile, nor do they claim \ntablets that cannot have their contents extracted with hot water. I do address this testimony as \npart of the secondary consideration of skepticism , infra p. 24. \n16 generic, as Plaintiffs contend, but I find it nevertheless sufficient to support a POSA's \nexpectations. Plaintiffs argue that the sentence in question \"makes no sense\" because the phrase \n\"cooled again\" suggests some undisclosed \"prior heating step.\" (D.I. 106 at 8). I disagree. Just as \none might say, \"I threw a boomerang , and it came back again,\" having only thrown the \nboomerang once, saying that tablets have been \"heated ... and cooled again\" seems to be a \ncommonplace , if somewhat vernacular , construction in English. \nI do not think that Dr. Mannion 's testimony about his own expectations outweighs Dr. \nAppel's testimony about a POSA's. It is possible that heating tablets without simultaneousl y \ncompressing them could change their properties , causing some of the problems Dr. Mannion \nlisted. It is also possible that applying heat with an oven rather than with the equipment used by \nBartholomaus or McGinity would simply not work. Neither of these possibilities seem likely \ngiven Dr. Appel's credible testimony. I appreciate that the prior art does not support a guarantee \nof success-but the law does not require a guarantee. I was not persuaded, based on Dr. \nMannion's testimony about his concerns as an individual fact witness, that a POSA could not \nstill reasonably expect the process to produce hardened tablets. \nPlaintiffs ' argument about Dr. Appel's trial demonstrative seems irrelevant. I think the \ndemonstrative was clearly intended as an example of how generally to find optimal ranges \nthrough experimentation. It was not intended to be indicative of how a POSA would approach \nthe specific task of combining Bartholomaus and McGinity with the Oven Art. Further, there is \nno need to show that a POSA would know the precise temperatures and times in the patent \nbefore trying the method---only that a POSA might reasonably expect to achieve success in that \nrange. See Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Corcept Therapeutics , Inc., 18 F.4th 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. \n2021) (noting that obviousness does not require a showing that \"a skilled artisan would have \n17 precisely predicted\" the claimed dosage of a drug, merely a showing of \"a reasonable \nexpectation of success in achieving the specific invention claimed\"). Here, common sense, as \nwell as the Oven Art, would suggest that heating times in ovens might be longer than, for \nexample, the times in Bartholomaus , which heated through direct contact. Unlike in Teva v. \nCorcept, nothing in the prior art taught against the times and temperatures in the Abuse\u00ad\nDeterrent Patents. See id. at 1379-80. \nIn sum, I find there was clear and convincing evidence that a POSA would reasonably \nexpect to produce hardened tablets by heating PEO tablets to their melting points in an oven. \nFurther, I find a POSA might reasonably expect the optimal heating times for its combined \nprocess to align with those in the patent. \n2. Time and Temperature Ranges \nI turn now to the second difference between the prior art and the claims at issue: the \ncuring times and temperatures disclosed in the patents. Of the three asserted claims, two claim \ncuring temperatures of 70\u00b0 C to 85\u00b0 C, while the third claims 65\u00b0 C to 90\u00b0 C. (Mannion '933 \npatent at 159:21-22; '808 patent at 159:62-63 ; '886 patent at 172:30). All three claim heating \ntimes from ten minutes to ten hours. (Mannion '933 patent at 159:22-23; '808 patent at 159:63-\n64; '886 patent at 172:31). The times taught in Shao overlap with the time ranges in the patents, \nbut Shao does not use PEO. (DTX-011 at 0002). The temperatures in Bartholomaus and \nOmelczuk are consistent with those in the asserted claims, but Bartholomaus teaches shorter and \nOmelczuk longer heating times. (DTX-010 at [0117]; DTX-014 at 0002). Because McGinity \nteaches melting the PEO, its temperatures are also consistent with those in the patent. (DTX-009 \nat 13:1-13). \n18 Defendant argues that the times and temperatures in the patent are the product of routine \nexperimentation. Thus, even though the exact ranges and combinations claimed are not present \nin the prior art, they can be found obvious. Dr. Appel testified regarding how a POSA would \nconduct these routine experiments to find an optimal range. (Tr. at 232:21-235:2 ). Plaintiffs \nrespond that more than routine experimentation is required because of the large range of possible \ntimes and temperatures . \n\"[W]here the general conditions of a claim are disclosed in the prior art, it is not \ninventive to discover the optimum or workable ranges [ of a result effective variable] by routine \nexperimentation. \" In re Applied Materials , Inc., 692 F.3d 1289, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting \nIn re Aller, 220 F.2d 454,456 (C.C.P.A. 1955)). Plaintiffs do not challenge the idea that time and \ntemperature are result-effective-that is, that they \"would ... have been recognized by one of \nordinary skill to affect a particular result.\" Id. at 1296. \nI am persuaded by Dr. Appel' s testimony that testing the curing procedure for various \nperiods of time is simple and routine. Her testimony aligns with common sense. Plaintiffs have \nnot offered any contrary evidence that arriving at a range of ten minutes to ten hours would be \nbeyond the routine skill and creativity of a POSA. \nOn the whole, I am persuaded that Defendant has presented clear and convincing \nevidence the patents are obvious over the prior art ofBartholomaus , McGinity, and the Oven Art. \nThe two primary differences between the patent and the prior art can be overcome by combining \nthe prior art references and engaging in routine experimentation. Defendant offered clear and \nconvincing evidence that a POSA would be motivated to combine the references and would have \nhad a reasonable expectation of success in doing so. Next, I turn to secondary considerations of \nnonobviousness. \n19 3. Secondary Considerations \nPlaintiffs have offered evidence of four secondary considerations of nonobviousness : \nunexpected results, commercial success, skepticism , and failure of others. A patentee is not \nrequired to present evidence of secondary considerations. See Prometheus Lab 'ys., Inc. v. \nRoxane Lab ys., Inc., 805 F.3d 1092, 1101-02 (Fed. Cir. 2015). There must be enough evidence, \nhowever, for a finding that a given secondary consideration exists by a preponderance of the \nevidence. See Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., Ltd., 839 F.3d 1034, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (en \nbane). If there is, then the probative value of each secondary consideration will be considered in \nlight of the evidence produced. That does not mean, though, that the burden of persuasion on the \nultimate question of obviousness transfers to the proponent of the secondary consideration. \nPfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2007). That burden stays always with \nthe patent challenger. Id. at 1359-60. \na. Unexpected Results \n\"In considering unexpected results, courts ask whether 'the claimed invention exhibits \nsome superior property or advantage that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would have \nfound surprising or unexpected.\"' Forest Lab ys., LLC v. Sigmapharm Lab ys., LLC, 918 F.3d \n928, 937 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Soni, 54 F.3d 746, 750 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). These results \nsupport a conclusion of nonobviousness where \"[t]he unexpected properties of the claimed \nformulation, even if inherent in that formulation , differ in kind from the prior art.\" Allergan, Inc. \nv. Sandoz Inc., 796 F.3d 1293, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (\"Allergan v. Sandoz IF'). \"[E]vidence of \nunexpected results and other secondary considerations will not necessarily overcome a strong \nprima facie showing of obviousness.\" Sud-Chemie , Inc. v. Multisorb Techs., 554 F.3d 1001, \n1009 (Fed. Cir. 2009). \n20 Plaintiffs argue that the decrease in tablet density caused by their novel manufacturing \nprocess enhanced the abuse-deterrent properties of the tablet. Plaintiffs contend that even though \nthe decrease in density is not claimed, its unexpectedness may still support nonobviousness \nunder Allergan v. Sandoz II. (D.I. 106 at 20). Plaintiffs ' fact witness Dr. Mannion testified that \nthe Abuse-Deterrent Patents' specifications describe determining a tablet's density because a \nmore porous tablet would be \"potentially , more resistant to abuse.\" (Tr. at 326:2-11 ). Plaintiffs ' \nexpert Dr. Bley likewise testified that a more porous tablet could gel more quickly if it were \ncrushed, making it more difficult to abuse by injection or inhalation . (Id. at 403:24-407:7 ). \nPlaintiffs also note that the patent examiner cited the surprising decrease in density as a reason \nfor allowing the claims. (D .I. 89-1 1 140). \nDefendant does not seem to dispute that the decrease in density was unexpected. Dr. \nAppel agreed that curing a tablet usually results in an increase in density. (Tr. at 264:4-25). \nHowever , Defendant argues that the decrease in density does not contribute to abuse deterrence \nand is therefore irrelevant to obviousness. (D.I. 109 at 8). Dr. Appel provided testimony that in \nother contexts , a decreased density in a gel could lead to faster drug release, and that it was \nunclear that the decrease in density from the patented process had any significant impact. (Tr. at \n675: 1-676: 1 ). \nWhile I find that Plaintiffs have established by a preponderance of the evidence the \nexistence of unexpected results, I do not find that the nature of these results is sufficient to \nundermine Defendant's clear and convincing evidence of obviousness . Specifically , I am not \npersuaded that Plaintiffs have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the decrease in \ndensity constituted a \"superior property or advantage .\" Forest Lab '.Ys, 918 F.3d at 937. The \ntestimony on the impact of a decrease in tablet density was too speculative for me to credit Dr. \n21 Bley's opinions above Dr. Appel's-at most, they seem to be in equipoise. Further, even if \nPlaintiffs had proven that the decrease in density was beneficial to abuse-deterrence , any \nincreased gelling benefit the decrease in density might offer would not alone undermine the clear \nand convincing evidence that the invention 's claimed properties are obvious. \nb. Commercial Success \n\"Commercial success is relevant because the law presumes an idea would successfull y \nhave been brought to market sooner, in response to market forces, had the idea been obvious to \npersons skilled in the art. Thus, the law deems evidence of (1) commercial success, and (2) some \ncausal relation or 'nexus' between an invention and commercial success of a product embodying \nthat invention , probative of whether an invention was nonobvious. \" Merck & Co. v. Teva \nPharms. USA, Inc., 395 F.3d 1364, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2005). When others are \"legally barred from \ncommercially testing\" the ideas of the claimed invention, \"[f]inancial success is not significantly \nprobative of that question. \" Id. at 1377. Even when commercial embodiments of the invention \nenjoy commercial success, the \"failure to link that commercial success to the features of [the] \ninvention that were not disclosed in [the prior art] undermines the probative force of the \nevidence. \" Asyst Techs., Inc. v. Emtrack, Inc., 544 F.3d 1310, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \nPlaintiffs ' expert, Mr. Arun Sharma, testified that OxyContin was and has continued to be \nthe most commercially successful extended-release opioid in the United States. (Tr. at 359:23-\n25, 368:11-15). Plaintiffs argue that OxyContin 's dominance of the extended-release opioid \nmarket is due to its combination of \"Original OxyContin 's medical advantages to patients, along \nwith the additional public-health benefits of being abuse deterrent. \" (D.I. 106 at 21-22). Plaintiffs \ncontend that because of the FDA and the public's desire for abuse-deterrent properties , \"[a]bsent \n[the abuse-deterrent] features, there would be no OxyContin and no commercial success at all.\" \n22 (Id. at 22). They also argue, citing only to other district court cases, that Accord's choice to file \nan ANDA for OxyContin , rather than for another opioid, and rather than developing their own \nformulation , is \"strong evidence of commercial success.\" (Id. at 21 ). \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs have shown no nexus between OxyContin 's commercial \nsuccess and the asserted claims. (D.I. 109 at 8-9). Defendant notes that Mr. Sharma admitted on \ncross-examination that he did not specifically consider the claimed features of OxyContin. (Tr. at \n382:15-383:5). Defendant 's expert, Mr. Ivan Hofmann, also noted that the new formulation \nreplaced the original formulation, with all sales transferred to the new formulation. (Id. at 653 :3-\n9). \nBased on the testimony of Plaintiffs ' and Defendant 's experts, I cannot conclude that \nreformulated OxyContin 's commercial success was the result of anything other than Purdue's \nexisting monopoly. Plaintiffs ' argument that Original OxyContin would have been withdrawn \nabsent the innovations of the Abuse-Deterrent Patents cannot support a finding of \nnonobviousness-the argument speaks only to the importance of abuse deterrence , not to its \nobviousness. I also note that there was no demonstrated increase in the success of OxyContin \nrelative to other opioids when the patented features were introduced. While the abuse-deterrent \nreformulation clearly did not drive customers away from OxyContin , a lack of commercial \nfailure is not the same as commercial success. \nI am also completely unpersuaded by the argument that Accord's choice to file an ANDA \nfor OxyContin in particular could be evidence of OxyContin' s commercial success or \nnonobviousness. The argument requires numerous unfounded assumptions. Further, the \nargument implies that it ought to be artificially more difficult to challenge a patent on \nobviousness grounds through ANDA litigation than through other channels. \n23 In all, I do not find that Plaintiffs have proven commercial success due to the claimed \nfeatures of the invention by a preponderance of the evidence. \nc. Skepticism \n\"Evidence of industry skepticism weighs in favor of non-obviousness . If industry \nparticipants or skilled artisans are skeptical about whether or how a problem could be solved or \nthe workability of the claimed solution, it favors non-obviousness.\" WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co., \n829 F.3d 1317, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \nPlaintiffs offer two examples of skepticism , by Dr. Mannion and by the FDA. \nSpecifically, as I discussed above, Dr. Mannion was skeptical that heating PEO tablets after \ncompression would work. He was concerned they might not hold shape (Tr. at 320: 1-18), might \nnot achieve the original extended release profile (id. at 308:16-25), and might be abused by hot \nwater extraction (id. at 310:12-311 :7). The FDA, meanwhile, required postmarketing studies \nbefore approving abuse-deterrent labeling. (D.I. 106 at 23). Defendant responds that neither of \nthese instances of skepticism represents the kind of \"industry skepticism\" used in an obviousness \nanalysis. (D.I. 109 at 8). \nI agree with Defendant. Dr. Mannion 's own testimony , as a named inventor, would seem \nto carry limited weight. He does not serve as a stand-in for a POSA, or for the industry. \nLikewise , the FDA, which is not in the industry, displayed an amount of skepticism \ncommensurate with the fact that this was the first extended-release opioid to receive abuse\u00ad\ndeterrent labelling. It seems natural that the FDA, as a regulatory body, would require real world \nstudies before being satisfied that a hard tablet was indeed abuse-deterrent. Therefore, I do not \nfind that Plaintiffs have proven industry skepticism by a preponderance of the evidence. \n24 d. Failure of Others \nThe failure of others may serve to \"negat[ e] an expectation of success.\" In re \nCyclobenzaprine , 676 F.3d at 1081. \"The purpose of evidence of failure of others is to show \n'indirectly the presence of a significant defect in the prior art, while serving as a simulated \nlaboratory test of the obviousness of the solution to a skilled artisan.\"' Id. at 1082 (quoting \nSymbol Techs., Inc. v. Opticon, Inc., 953 F.2d 1569, 1578-79 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). However , for the \nfailure of others to be probative, it should be the case that \"these prior attempts failed because the \ndevices lacked the claimed features.\" Ormco Corp. v. Align Tech., Inc., 463 F.3d 1299, 1313 \n(Fed. Cir. 2006). \nPlaintiffs note two failures of others: Accord's own attempts to develop an abuse\u00ad\ndeterrent oxycodone formulation by acquiring Develco, and Grunenthal ' s crush resistant \ntechnology, which was used in the withdrawn opioid product, Opana ER. (D.I. 106 at 23-24). \nDefendant responds that its efforts with Develco failed due to difficulties with scaling and \nproduction . (Tr. at 67 4: 12-14 ). It also notes that Opana ER used a different active ingredient , and \nthat it is unclear why Opana ER was withdrawn. (Tr. at 673:7-22). \nFirst, if anything, the production failures of Develco seem to weigh in favor of the \nproduction-scale-based motivation to combine that I found above, rather than in favor of the \nnonobviousness of the patents. Second, I agree with the Defendant that the record is not clear on \nwhy Opana was removed from the market. Plaintiffs did not establish by a preponderance of the \nevidence that Opana's removal was related to its lack of \"the claimed features.\" Ormco, 463 F.3d \nat 1313. 7 Even if Opana was withdrawn because its different manufacturing process made it \n7 I note also that the claims do not specify any particular level of abuse deterrence or ability to \nwithstand crushing forces. I address Plaintiffs ' argument that Opana was removed because it was \n25 insufficiently abuse-deterrent , I am not sure that indicates a failure by Grunenthal. Specifically, \nGrunenthal seemed satisfied with the results of its manufacturing process, as evidenced by the \nfact that a product made with its technology was released to market. The record does not indicate \nthat Grunenthal tried and failed to make a more abuse-deterrent or otherwise superior product. \nThus, this seems to be at most an issue of Grunenthal 's standards, and not of a POSA's ability to \ninvent the claimed product. I do not find that these failures-if they are failures-weigh in favor \nof nonobviousness. \nIV. THE LOW-ABUK PATENTS \nA. The Asserted Claims \nThe claims at issue are claims 3 and 11 of the '93 3 patent and claim 21 of the '919 patent. \nClaim 3 of the '933 patent and claim 21 of the '919 patent claim pharmaceutical compositions , \nwhile claim 11 of the '933 patent is a method claim for preparing such compositions. Claim 3 of \nthe '933 patent depends on claim 1. The two claims read, \n1. An oxycodone hydrochloride composition , which comprises at least 95% \noxycodone hydrochloride, 8a, 14-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodeinone , and less than \n25 ppm of 14-hydroxycodeinone. \n3. The oxycodone hydrochloride composition of claim 1, having less than 10 ppm of \n14-hydroxycodeinone. \n('933 patent at 34:27-30, 33-34). Claim 11 of the '933 patent depends on claim 10. Those claims \nread, \n10. A process for preparing an oxycodone hydrochloride composition having less than \n25 ppm 14-hydroxycodeinone , comprising removing 8a, 14-dihydroxy- 7,8-\ndihydrocodeinone from an oxycodone base composition and converting the \noxycodone base composition to an oxycodone hydrochloride composition having \nless than 25 ppm 14-hydroxycodeinone. \nnot sufficiently abuse deterrent, but I am not sure the argument is relevant to the nonobviousness \nof anything actually claimed by the patents. \n26 11. The process of claim 10, compnsmg combining hydrochloric acid and the \noxycodone base composition in a solvent to form a solution, and isolating the \noxycodone hydrochloride composition having less than 25 ppm 14-\nhydroxycodeinone from the solution. \n('933 patent at 34:52-63). \nClaim 21 of the '919 patent depends on claim 18. The claims read, \n18. A pharmaceutically acceptable formulation comprising oxycodone HCl, 8a,14-\ndihydroxy-7 ,8-dihydrocodeinone , and less than 100 ppm of 14-hydroxycodeinone , \nwherein the ratio of 8a,14-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodeinone to oxycodone HCl is \n0.04% or less as measured by HPLC. \n21. The pharmaceutically acceptable formulation of claim 18, comprising less than 15 \nppm of 14-hydroxycodeinone. \n('919 patent at 36:7-11, 16-17). \nB. Findings of Fact \n1. The earliest effective filing date of the Low ABUK patents is March 30, 2004. \n(D.I. 89-1 ,r,r 13, 16). The Low ABUK patents are entitled to an invention date of \nJune 11, 2003, which is the first time Plaintiffs reduced the complete invention to \npractice. (Tr. at 510:19-514:8; PTX-641 at 57; see also PTX-371). \n2. A POSA for the purposes of the asserted claims of the Low ABUK patents is an \norganic chemist with experience in synthetic and analytical chemistry. Such a \nperson would have knowledge of the publicly-disclosed chemical reactions \nrelevant to the field, how to search the relevant literature , and how to accomplish \nsuch chemical reactions. (D.I. 89-1 ,r 95). \n3. Roland Kra13nig et al., Optimization of the Synthesis of Oxycodone and 5-\nMethyloxycodone , 329 Archiv der Pharmazie. 6, 325 (1996) (\"Krassnig\") is prior \nart to the asserted patents under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). (D.I. 89-1 ,r 61; DTX-019). \nKrassnig teaches that the naturally occurring compound thebaine can be oxidized \nto form 14-hydroxy, which can be hydrogenated into oxycodone. (DTX-019) . \n4.

The intermediate product 14-hydroxy is an \"alpha beta unsaturated ketone\" or \n\"ABUK,\" a class of compounds understood at the time of the invention to be \nhighly reactive and potentially genotoxic. (D.I. 89-1 1113; Tr. at 59:23-60:9, \n465 :3-18). By 2000, named inventor Dr. Robert Kupper was concerned that \nABUKs, which had certain structural features similar to other, genotoxic \ncompounds, might also be genotoxic, based on his prior experience . (Tr. at \n463:24-25, 465:3-18). \n12. A POSA would understand that not all the intermediate 14-hydroxy would \nnecessarily be turned into oxycodone during the hydrogenation step. (Tr. at 74:4-\n74: 15). 14-hydroxy remaining after the hydrogenation step would be turned into \n14-hydroxy hydrochloride by the salt formation process. (Tr. 69:21-70:5). \n13. At least by September 3, 2002, the FDA began requesting that opioid \nmanufacturers either reduce the levels of ABUKs in opioid products to under 10 \nppm or provide testing demonstrating that they were not genotoxic. (PTX-560 at \nP4107528; Tr. at 493:15-494:7). This information went to multiple opioid \nmanufacturers. (Tr. at 493:15-494:7). The FDA also made clear that \"the issue is \ngeneral and will affect all products containing opioid derivatives.\" (PTX-560 at \nP4107528). \n14. A POSA seeking to modify the three-step prior art oxycodone synthesis process to \nachieve lower 14-hydroxy levels in the final oxycodone composition would have \nhad two options. First, a POSA could have used the teachings ofRamanathan to \nhydrogenate the composition again after the salt formation step, which would turn \nany of the 14-hydroxy hydrochloride into oxycodone hydrochloride. (Tr. at 70:6-\n71:8). Second, since 14-hydroxy is an intermediate product, a POSA could have \ntried to intervene during or after hydrogenation to ensure that no 14-hydroxy \n29 would remain in the composition prior to the salt formation step. (Tr. at 74:4-\n75:4). \n15. The first path would not be desirable , because it would be costly, likely reduce \nyield, and possibly introduce impurities. (Tr. at 73:16-74:3 , 587:3-18). A POSA \nwould prefer to solve the problem at an earlier stage. (Tr. at 73:23-25) . \n16. Taking the second path would cause 14-hydroxy to reappear during the salt \nformation. A POSA motivated to lower 14-hydroxy levels would attempt to \ndetermine why 14-hydroxy was reappearing. (Tr. at 74:4-75:19). \n17. 8P,14-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodeinone (''8P\") was known in the prior art to form \nas a byproduct during the oxidation step. (D.I. 89-1 ,r 78; DTX-020; DTX-021 ; \nTr. at 46:22-47:13). \n18. 8a is a stereoisomer of 8p. (D.I. 98, Ex. 1 ,r 102). 8a had always been present in \noxycodone compositions but had not been described prior to the Low-ABUK \nPatents. (Tr. at 94:19-95:4). \n19. A POSA would have contemplated a limited number of reaction mechanisms to \nexplain the presence of 8p. (Tr. at 47:24-48:19 , 50:1-50:16, 176:14-177:3). Two \nlikely candidates, which were described in the prior art, would be the ring\u00ad\nopening of an epoxide (Tr. at 47:24-49:25; PTX-310) , and the hydration of 14-\nhydroxy (Tr. at 50:1-51:7; DTX-032). A POSA considering either possibility \nwould also predict the presence of 8a. (Tr. at 51:11-52 :25; Tr. 53:1-54:16). \n20. A POSA would understand that both 8P and 8a could undergo dehydration \nreactions to form 14-hydroxy , (Tr. at 76:25-81 :25), and that the conditions of the \nsalt formation step would cause such reactions. (Tr. at 101: 15-19). \n21. A POSA would understand that 8a would dehydrate under milder conditions and \nmore rapidly than 8P, forming more 14-hydroxy more easily. (Tr. at 84:10-19). \n22. A POSA would have the knowledge and experience to hypothesize that either 8a, \n8P, or both were most likely responsible for the reappearance of 14-hydroxy. (Tr. \nat 76:16-24 , 81:10-25) . A POSA would be able to test and confirm this hypothesis \nthrough routine experimentation. (Tr. at 77:29-85:2). \n23. A POSA seeking to lower 14-hydrox y levels would seek to convert 8a and 8P into \n14-hydroxy through dehydration prior to the completion of hydrogenation, so that \nthe resulting 14-hydroxy would then be converted into oxycodone by the \nhydrogenation. (Tr. at 76:16-77:24 , 87:16-88:1). A POSA would have the \nknowledge and experience to understand from Weiss and Ramanathan how to \ndehydrate 8P and 8a into 14-hydroxy . (Tr. at 50:6-16, 88:2-11). Dehydration that \ntargeted 8P would automatically convert 8a as well. (Tr. at 100:17-101:3). \n24. A POSA would recognize that forcing the dehydration of 8a and 8P either before \nor during the hydrogenation would be effective. (Tr. at 88:12-89 :6). A POSA \n30 would have understood from Chiu that the hydrogenation could be performed in \nacidic conditions to allow the dehydration of 8a and 8~ to occur simultaneously . \n(Tr. at 89:7-12). \nC. Conclusions of Law \n1. Invention Date of the Low ABUK Patents \nThe parties dispute whether the Lin reference , dated June 5, 2003, is prior art to the Low\u00ad\nABUK Patents. They do not dispute that the Low-AB UK Patents were reduced to practice on \nJune 11, 2003. This would ordinarily make Lin prior art, but \"[p ]re-AIA section 102(g) allows a \npatent owner to antedate a reference by proving earlier conception and reasonable diligence in \nreducing to practice.\" Perfect Surgical Techniques , Inc. v. Olympus Am., Inc., 841 F.3d 1004, \n1007 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \"Whether a patent antedates a reference is a question oflaw based on \nsubsidiary findings of fact.\" Id. at 1009. \"An idea is sufficiently definite for conception 'when \nthe inventor has a specific, settled idea, a particular solution to the problem at hand, not just a \ngeneral goal or research plan he hopes to pursue.\"' Creative Compounds , LLC v. Starmark \nLab 'ys., 651 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (quoting Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr \nLab 'ys., 40 F.3d 1223, 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1994)). \nThe patent holder has the burden of producing evidence to support an earlier conception. \nMahurkar v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 79 F.3d 1572, 1576-77 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Where \"a party seeks to \nprove conception via the oral testimony of a(n] ... inventor, the party must proffer evidence \ncorroborating that testimony .\" Shu-Hui Chen v. Bouchard , 347 F.3d 1299, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \nSpecifically , \"the inventor must provide independent corroborating evidence in addition to his \nown statements and documents. \" Brown v. Barbacid , 276 F.3d 1327, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2002) \n( cleaned up). The sufficiency of the evidence of earlier conception is determined under the \"rule \nofreason.\" Mahurkar , 79 F.3d at 1577. The \"rule ofreason \" requires \"examin[ing] all pertinent \n31 evidence to determine the credibility of the inventor's story.\" Brown, 276 F.3d at 1335 (internal \nquotations omitted). \nPlaintiffs offer testimony by named inventors Mr. Lonn Rider and Dr. Robert Kupper to \nmeet their burden of production. (D.I. 106 at 30-31). They also offer Mr. Rider's lab notebooks \nand internal communications about the efforts to lower 14-hydroxy levels. (Id.). Plaintiffs argue, \nbased on this evidence, that conception of the invention occurred no later than February 6, 2003, \nthe date on which Mr. Rider wrote a memo to his supervisor about his efforts to lower 14-\nhydroxy levels. (D.I. 107 if 63). Plaintiffs assert that the inventors were diligent after the \nFebruary 6 conception , and certainly between the operative period of June 5-11, which allows \nthe asserted patents to antedate Lin. (D.I. 106 at 30). \nDefendant does not dispute that the Low ABUK Patents are entitled to a priority date of \nat least as early as June 11, 2003, when the invention was reduced to practice. (D.I. 100 ,r 53). \nDefendant provides little argument against the antedating other than to say Plaintiffs are not \nentitled to a February 2003 invention date. (Id.) \nDespite Defendant 's conclusory response, I do not think that Mr. Rider's and Dr. \nKupper's testimony, to the extent that they are corroborated by various documents , satisfy \nPlaintiffs ' burden of production for conception. Dr. Kupper merely testified that as of November \n2002, he thought \"either 8a or 8~\" was likely responsible for 14-hydroxy in the final product. \n(Tr. at 481:3-482 :16). His testimony was corroborated by an internal report, but I do not find that \nit demonstrates conception of every feature of the claimed invention. (PTX-356 ). Dr. Kupper did \nnot testify regarding the February 6 memo. \nMr. Rider testified more definitively that as of February he had concluded \"[t]hat 8a was \nthe source of the 14-hydroxycodeinone .\" (Tr. at 504:11-14). Plaintiffs offered Mr. Rider's \n32 verified laboratory notebook and auxiliary data as corroboration . (PTX-352 ; PTX-354). \nHowever , Mr. Rider did not testify as to the interpretation or contents of his notes or the \nauxiliary data. Meanwhile , his February 6, 2003, memo to his supervisor said that \"it [was] \ndifficult to be certain\" that 8a was responsible for the challenges in reducing 14-hydroxy, and \nthat it \"warrant[ed] further investigation. \" (PTX-352 at P4193989). The memo does not seem to \ncorroborate Mr. Rider's testimony. It describes \"a general goal or research plan\" rather than \"a \nspecific, settled idea, a particular solution to the problem at hand.\" Burroughs Wellcome , 40 F.3d \nat 1228. \nI conclude that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of producing sufficient , corroborated \nevidence that the Low-AB UK Patents were conceived of on February 6, 2003. Plaintiffs further \ndid not present evidence of conception on any other date between February 6 and June 11. \nTherefore , the priority date of the patents remains the uncontested date of reduction to practice, \nJune 11, 2003, and the Lin reference is prior art. \n2. Obviousness of the Low-ABUK Patents \nThe asserted claims of the Low-ABUK Patents differ from each other in scope and \ncontent. Claim 3 of the '933 patent requires a composition of at least 95% oxycodone HCl, 8a, \nand levels below 10 ppm of 14-hydrox y. ('933 patent at 34:27-39 , 33-34). Claim 21 of the '919 \npatent adds the requirement that the ratio of 8a to oxycodone HCl be 0.04% or less, but allows \nup 15 ppm 14-hydroxy. ('919 patent at 36:7-11, 16-17). Claim 19 of the '933 patent is a method \nclaim. It requires that the final product have less than 25 ppm of 14-hydrox y and be made by a \nparticular process that includes removing 8a from an oxycodone base before salt formation and \nemploying hydrochloric acid in the salt formation step. ('933 patent at 34:52-63). \n33 Broadly, the parties' disputes fall into two categories: the obviousness of low levels of \n14-hydroxy and the obviousness of the inventors' discovery of 8a.8 I address the 14-hydroxy and \n8a arguments in turn, noting where they are interrelated. 9 \nFirst, I discuss whether a POSA would have been motivated to achieve low levels of 14-\nhydroxy by modifying the prior art. \"For a patent to be obvious, 'some kind of motivation must \nbe shown ... so that the jury can understand why a person of ordinary skill would have thought \nof either combining two or more references or modifying one to achieve the patented method.\"' \nShire, 802 F.3d at 1306 (quoting Innogenetics , NV v. Abbott Lab ys., 512 F.3d 1363, 1374 (Fed. \nCir. 2008)). Then, I consider whether a POSA would have been able to do so by combining the \nteachings of the prior art and engaging in routine experimentation. \nSecond, I discuss whether the discovery of 8a renders the purified compositions \npatentable. I consider whether the various 8a limitations were inherently disclosed in the prior \nart. I also consider whether a POSA would have identified 8a as a matter of course while \nattempting to lower levels of 14-hydroxy , and whether explicit identification of 8a was necessary \nto arriving at the rest of the claimed inventions. \nFor the reasons below, I find the three asserted claims of the Low-ABUK Patents invalid \nfor obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 \na. 14-Hydroxy \n8 Neither party presents any argument that the 10, 15, and 25 ppm requirements should be \nanalyzed separately. Thus, I consider only the obviousness of levels of 14-hydroxy below 10 \nppm, since the other thresholds would seem to follow. The parties likewise do not argue that \nother claim limitations, such as turning oxycodone free base into a hydrochloride salt or using \nhydrochloric acid to form a hydrochloride salt, are missing from the prior art or render the \ninvention nonobvious. \n9 Defendant continues to refer to factual findings from In re OxyContin in footnotes. (See, e.g., \nD.I. 99 at 26 n.11). I continue to disregard these findings for the same reasons described in supra \nn.1. \n34 1. Motivation to Lower 14-Hydroxy \nDefendant argues that a POSA would have been motivated to modify the prior art as of \nSeptember 12, 2002, based on a communication from the FDA sent to multiple opioid \nmanufacturers about future ABUK restrictions. (D.I. 99 at 23-24; PTX-560 ). Plaintiffs as a \npreliminary matter contend that Defendant waived its argument that the September FDA \ncommunication provided a motivation to modify, because Defendant \"never identified that date \nor a purported evidentiary basis for it during fact or expert discovery , and it contradicts Accord's \nissues in the Pretrial Order.\" (D.I. 106 at 33). Plaintiffs assert that Accord changed its position \nabout the timing of the motivation to combine because Plaintiffs successfully proved an earlier \ninvention date (June 11, 2003) at trial. (Id. at 34). Defendant responds that it has always stated \nthat the FDA provided the motivation and that Plaintiffs suffered no prejudice from Defendant 's \nnot specifically naming September 12, 2002, since testimony and evidence offered by Plaintiffs \nalluded to FDA communications about ABUKs as early as January 2003, which was still before \nJune 11. (D.I. 109 at 11 & n.5).10 \nI do not find that Defendant waived the argument to a September 2002 motivation to \ncombine. As far as I can tell, Defendant did not identify any specific date for a motivation to \nmodify in the Pretrial Order, so failure to identify September 12 does not seem like a problem. \nDefendant did identify the FDA as the source of the motivation, which is consistent with its \ncurrent argument. (D.I. 89-3 ,r 74). While Defendant referred to \"2003 and 2004\" as the time \nperiod over which the FDA \"became concerned ,\" (id. at ,r 11), I do not think this vague language \n10 Defendant also claims in a footnote that Plaintiffs only started arguing for the June priority \ndate after Defendant submitted its Proposed Findings of Fact. (D.I. 109 at 11 n.5). It is not clear \nto me whether this is the case, though I note that Plaintiffs did not identify June 11 as a possible \ninvention date in their statement of issues of fact. (See D.I. 89-2). I do not think it matters. If it is \nthe case, it would only support my finding of no waiver. \n35 rules out the possibility that murmurings about ABUKs in the industry began in late 2002 or \nearly 2003---especially when evidence and testimony by Plaintiffs ' witness support that idea. In \nthe single case cited by Plaintiffs , a party did not express any intent to raise the issue of an earlier \npriority date until post-trial briefing. UCB, Inc. v. Watson Lab ys, 2017 WL 11646645 at *40 (D. \nDel. Nov. 14, 2017). Here, the POSA's motivation was always at issue-as Plaintiffs \nacknowledge. (D.I.89-2132). \nDefendant 's argument for a September 2002 motivation to combine relies on testimony \nby Plaintiffs ' witness, Dr. Kupper. Dr. Kupper testified regarding an internal Rhodes email on \nSeptember 12, 2002, which he agreed indicated that the \"FDA was concerned about ABUK \nimpurities.\" (Tr. at 493:20-22). The email stated that the FDA wanted Purdue to reduce \nmorphinone, another ABUK, to levels of\"less than 10 parts per million (ppm), or 0.001 %\" in the \nopioid product Palladone. (PTX-560 at P4107528 ). The email mentioned that the \"issue is \ngeneral and will affect all products containing opioid derivatives .\" (Id.). Dr. Kupper testified that \nhe understood from the email that other manufacturers had also been told they would have to \nlower ABUK levels. (Tr. at 494:5-7). Defendant 's expert, Dr. Stephen Martin, testified that \n\"[C]ompounds related to [ABUKs] were long known ... to be genotoxic. So there would always \nbe some kind of concern about reactivity of this functional group.\" (Tr. at 60:6-60:9). \nPlaintiffs argue that because the FDA did not specifically require ABUK levels below 10 \nppm until December 2003, a POSA would not have been motivated to achieve such levels until \nDecember 2003 at the earliest. (D.I. 106 at 34-35). As for the 2002 communication , Plaintiffs \nargue that a subsequent internal email indicated that Purdue was proceeding under the \nassumption that existing approved products would not be affected. (D.I. 106 at 34; D.I. 1071 \n82). Plaintiffs also note that the 2002 communication related to \"lowering the amount of a \n36 different ABUK (morphinone) in a different unapproved product (Palladone) that had a different \nactive ingredient (hydromorphone).\" (D.I. 106 at 34; PTX-560 at P4107528). Plaintiffs argue \nthat Purdue initially objected to the stringent requirement by proposing a more relaxed \nrequirement of 0.05% (500 ppm) and stating it would attempt to test whether ABUKs were \ngenotoxic. (D.I. 106 at 34; PTX-560 at P4107529) . \nFDA communications can \"introduce(] a market force incentivizing \" a particular \ninvention. Endo Pharms., Inc. v. Actavis LLC, 922 F.3d 1365, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Indeed, a \nrequirement that a product meet a particular threshold is likely to be a strong market force, since \nfailure to meet that requirement would exclude the product from the market completely, rather \nthan merely making it less competitive. As I also noted in my discussion of the Abuse-Deterrent \nPatents, supra p.12, \"it often may be the case that market demand, rather than scientific \nliterature , will drive design trends.\" KSR, 550 U.S. at 419. Thus, an FDA letter creating market \nforces may serve as a motivation to combine. \nDefendant's evidence is clear and convincing. I think an awareness that the FDA might \nimpose low-ABUK requirements would immediately motivate a POSA to seek a way to lower \nthe levels of ABUKs in a pharmaceutical product. Even if the requirements were in the future, I \nthink a POSA would be motivated to get ahead of the requirements. Further, the knowledge that \nthe FDA was considering a threshold of 10 ppm would motivate a POSA to try to achieve that \nlevel in particular. It is true that the 2002 FDA email concerns a different product, but the email \nalso clearly says, \"While this was a Palladone-specific teleconference , the FDA informed us that \nthis issue is general and will affect all products containing opioid derivatives. \" (PTX-560 at \nP4107528). Indeed, when the email was forwarded to Dr. Kupper, it was with an allusion to that \nsentence and its \"implications. \" (Id.). Dr. Kupper further admitted on cross examination that he \n37 \"understood from [the email] that the FDA had communicated that same information to other \nmanufacturers \" (Tr. at 494:5-7), demonstrating that a POSA, and not just a Purdue or Rhodes \nemployee, would have been motivated . \nI am not persuaded by Plaintiffs ' observation about Purdue's understanding that any \nfuture requirements would not affect approved products. The inquiry is not what Purdue \nunderstood from the communication but what a POSA would have understood. I also do not find \nPurdue's attempt to negotiate with the FDA on the strictness of the requirements to weigh \nagainst a POSA's motivation to modify the prior art. Purdue's response suggesting a 500 ppm \nthreshold and proposing continued testing to determine toxicity suggests to me only that Purdue \nsought to keep its options for solving the problem open. Pursuing all available options seems like \nthe prudent response for a company facing new regulations on a highly profitable class of \nproducts. In the absence of FDA acceptance of a higher threshold , I would still expect a POSA to \nprepare for the possibility of a lower threshold of 10 ppm. Likewise , the possibility of testing \nABUK.s for toxicity as an alternative option would not reduce a POSA's motivation to pursue \nother solutions. \nAlthough not the focus of Defendant 's argument , testimony at trial also indicated that an \nunderstanding or suspicion that ABUKs were toxic existed even before September 2002. Dr. \nMartin testified that a POSA would potentiall y be concerned about ABUK.s anyway given their \nstructure. (Tr. at 59:23-60: 18). Dr. Kupper mentioned that he first became concerned about \nABUK.s based on their molecular structure. (Tr. at 464:24-465:15). Certainly, a statement by Dr. \nKupper, an inventor on the patent, is not on its own probative of a POSA's motivation to modify \nthe prior art. However, Dr. Kupper's concerns were consistent with Dr. Martin's expert \ntestimony. I am not convinced that concerns about potential toxicity on their own would \n38 motivate a POSA to incur the cost of developing a purified product. I do, however, think that \nsuch concerns in the field would serve to make the possibility of future FDA requirements a \ncredible, and perhaps even expected , threat, thus making the motivation to combine all the \nstronger. \nOn the whole , I find that Defendant presented clear and convincing evidence that a POSA \nwould have been motivated to modify the prior art process of synthesizing oxycodone to achieve \nABUK levels below 10 ppm. \n11. Routine Experimentation \nI now turn to whether, provided with this motivation , a POSA could reasonably have \nexpected to arrive at the asserted claims through routine experimentation. Defendant asserts that \na POSA would have two clear starting points: either adding a final hydrogenation step to remove \n14-hydroxy hydrochloride or attempting to remove 14-hydroxy at an earlier stage. (D.I. 99 at 26, \n30). Dr. Martin testified that pursuing the latter path would lead a POSA to try to ensure that all \n8a and 8~ in the composition dehydrated into 14-hydroxy before the hydrogenation step was \ncomplete . (Id. at 30). Defendant argues that because achieving the claimed invention from either \nstarting point would require only routine techniques , a POSA would have a reasonable \nexpectation of success. (D.I. 109 at 12). \nPlaintiffs respond that a POSA would not have a reasonable expectation of success \nthrough the first option of adding a final hydrogenation step. (D.I. 106 at 36). Plaintiffs ' expert \nwitness, Dr. James Wuest, testified that a POSA would know that adding a hydrogenation step \nwould reduce yield and potentially introduce impurities. (Tr. at 587:6-18). Plaintiffs argue that a \nPOSA pursuing the second option of earlier removal of 14-hydroxy would be quickly stymied by \na lack of knowledge of 8a. (D .I. 106 at 3 7-3 8). Specifically, they argue that a POSA would not \n39 be led to ensure the dehydration of 8a and 8P because a POSA would not know that 8a was the \nsource of the problem and would not think that 8P could be. Without such knowledge , Plaintiffs \ncontend, the POSA could not have a reasonable expectation of success at lowering 14-hydroxy \nlevels by ensuring the dehydration of 8a and 8p. (Id.). \n\"When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite \nnumber of identified, predictable solutions , a person of ordinary skill in the art has good reason \nto pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp.\" KSR, 550 U.S. at 421. Thus, \nevidence of obviousness may be sufficient when \"it indicates that the possible options skilled \nartisans would have encountered were 'finite,' 'small,' or 'easily traversed ,' and that skilled \nartisans would have had a reason to select the route that produced the claimed invention. \" In re \nCyclobenzaprine , 676 F.3d at 1072 (quoting Ortho-Mc Neil Pharm., Inc. v. Mylan Lab 'ys., Inc., \n520 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2008)). An invention is obvious over prior art if \"the order and \ndetail of the steps, if not already known, would have been discovered by routine experimentation \nwhile implementing known principles. \" Merck Sharp & Dahme Corp. v. Hospira, Inc., 874 F.3d \n724, 730 (Fed. Cir. 2017). The obviousnesss inquiry \"not only permits, but requires, \nconsideration of common knowledge and common sense.\" Randall Mfg. v. Rea, 733 F.3d 1355, \n1362 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (quoting DyStar Textilfarben GmbH & Co. Deutsch/and KG v. CH \nPatrick Co., 464 F.3d 1356, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). \nI was persuaded by Dr. Martin's testimony that a POSA seeking to reduce 14-hydroxy \nlevels would have a finite, small, and easily identified set of options. Dr. Wuest never testified, \nand Plaintiffs never argued, that a POSA would have had other options for reducing 14-hydroxy \nor that a POSA would not have known where to start. Based on both Dr. Wuest's and Dr. \nMartin's testimony , however, I am skeptical that a POSA would have pursued adding an extra \n40 hydrogenation step to directly convert 14-hydroxy hydrochloride into oxycodone hydrochloride . \nBoth testified that doing so would be expensive and potentially introduce other impurities. \nPlaintiffs argue that this cuts against Defendant 's theory of obviousness. I disagree. If anything , a \nPOSA's disinclination for adding an extra hydrogenation step would only further narrow the set \nof feasible options. \nI find that Defendant has presented clear and convincing argument that a POSA would try \nto intervene at an earlier stage of the oxycodone synthesis to ensure that all 14-hydroxy was \nconverted to oxycodone prior to salt formation. I am also persuaded that a POSA would have the \nknowledge and skill to do so successfully. 14-hydroxy was a known intermediate product. It \nseems well within a POSA's skill to more completely eliminate a known byproduct with a \nknown method of conversion. It is true that this path would not immediately succeed-as the \ninventors themselves found, 14-hydrox y would reappear. However , Dr. Martin clearly testified \nthat such a roadblock would be within the skill of a POSA to address. \nDr. Martin clearly and convincingly outlined that a POSA would have been trained to \npropose reaction mechanisms to explain the results of their experiments. (Tr. at 47: 17-48:5). Dr. \nWuest agreed that he trained students to propose reaction mechanisms. (Tr. at 602: 16-603 :2). Dr. \nMartin further testified, and Dr. Wuest agreed, that the possible reaction mechanisms at issue in \nthis case would have been familiar to a POSA. (Tr. at 48:6-50: 16, 603:3-8, 605:2-8, 608:23-\n609:6). Dr. Martin explained how a POSA would \"analyze the reaction mixture,\" a procedure he \ncharacterized as routine, to test the limited number of possibilities in order to determine the \nsource of the 14-hydroxy problem. (Tr. at 77 :25-78: 17, 79: 17-81 :9). As I discuss further below, \nDr. Martin explained that solving a problem that the POSA now understood would be well \nwithin the POSA's skill. (Tr. at 87:16-89:12) . \n41 Plaintiffs do not offer any path along which a POSA would be led astray. Dr. Wuest only \ntestified that no prior art reference was on its own a perfect fit and asserted that a POSA would \nface \"obstacles. \" (Tr. at 600:13-14). As far as I can tell, Plaintiffs ' reasoning leads to the \nconclusion that a POSA would simply have given up in the face of 14-hydrox y's reappearance. \nHowever , given my finding that a POSA would have been motivated to solve the issue of 14-\nhydroxy, I think a POSA would have \"good reason to pursue the known options within his or her \ntechnical grasp\" and to modify the prior art in readily apparent ways. KSR, 550 U.S. at 421. \nTherefore , I find Dr. Martin's testimony as to what a POSA would have done more credible. \nFurther, because only routine techniques and commonl y possessed training would be required, I \nfind that the POSA would have had a reasonable expectation of success. \nPlaintiffs also make something akin to a \"failure of others\" argument to \"negat[ e] an \nexpectation of success.\"11 In re Cycloben zaprine, 676 F.3d at 1081. Plaintiffs presented evidence \nthat oxycodone HCl manufacturer Noramco received a communication from the FDA in \nDecember 2003 requiring lower levels of 14-hydrox y. (DTX-115 at 0002). In response, Noramco \ncharacterized the task as \"a technical and scientific challenge. \" (Id.). Plaintiffs introduced \ndeposition testimony from earlier litigation indicating that Noramco did not finish developing its \nlow-AB UK oxycodone until 2007, despite the project starting in 2003. (Tr. at 548: 17-20). \nDefendant responds that Plaintiffs ' evidence \"shows Noramco was merely cautious.\" (D.I. 109 at \n19). \n11 Although \"failure of others\" is usually a secondary consideration of nonobviousness, Graham, \n383 U.S. at 17-18, Plaintiffs do not present this evidence as an independent secondary \nconsideration. Instead, they characterize Noramco 's failure as evidence that a POSA would not \nhave had a reasonable expectation of success. (D.I. 106 at 39-40; Tr. at 754:19-24). Some cases \nhave treated failure of others in this way. See Boehring er lngelheim Vetmedica , Inc. v. Schering\u00ad\nPlough Corp., 320 F.3d 1339, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \n42 I agree with Defendant. I do not find the Noramco evidence sufficient to contradict Dr. \nMartin's testimony that a POSA would have had a reasonable expectation of success. Noramco 's \ncharacterizing the task as a challenge , like Purdue's earlier suggestion of a higher ABUK content \nthreshold , seems like the expected and prudent behavior of a company facing a likelihood of \nstricter regulations. Noramco 's desire to keep its options open seems reasonable and expected. \nThe fact that Noramco took years to develop low-ABUK oxycodone is far from probative . The \nrecord, including the video deposition testimony by Noramco employees , is simply not clear on \nwhether the time-consuming aspects of development had anything to do with the claimed \ninvention. I do not find that Dr. Martin's testimony is contradicted by a single, incomplete \nanecdote that Noramco protested the requirements and took a long time to develop the product. \nb. 8a \nI now turn to the issue of whether the disclosure of 8a, either as an independent claim \nlimitation not disclosed in the prior art, or as a necessary step to reaching the 14-hydroxy \nlimitations , renders the patent nonobvious. Because I find that the discovery of 8a itself would \nhave been routine for a POSA, I do not find that the explicit disclosure of 8a renders the claims \npatentable. \nDefendant argues that although no claim limitations relating to 8a are in the prior art, 8a \nwas inherently present in prior art oxycodone compositions. (D.I. 99 at 27). Defendant argues \nfurther that identifying 8a was itself a routine endeavor , and that a POSA could have arrived at \nthe claimed inventions without discovering 8a at all. (D.I. 99 at 36, 38). \nPlaintiffs respond that 8a is not merely an inherent property of oxycodone formulations \nbut rather a \"foundational discovery \" in achieving low-AB UK oxycodone . (D.I. 106 at 32). \nPlaintiffs assert that the 8a limitations consequently \"cannot be viewed in isolation from the \n43 remainder of the claims.\" (Id.). They reason that the explicit disclosure of 8a renders the \ninvention patentable , even if 8a can be found inherently in the prior art. (Id. at 30). Plaintiffs also \nnote the field's \"longstanding examination of oxycodone and its impurities ,\" suggesting that if \n8a were obvious it would already have been discovered. Plaintiffs further repeatedly note that \n8a's level of reactivity is \"surprising .\" (See, e.g., id. at 30). They argue that a POSA could not \nhave known how reactive 8a would be, and without that knowledge , could not have realized that \n8a needed to be removed in the way the inventors did. (Id. at 32). \n\"[I]nherency may supply a missing claim limitation in an obviousness analysis.\" Par \nPharm., Inc. v. TWi Pharms., Inc., 773 F.3d 1186, 1194-95 (Fed. Cir. 2014). However , it \"may \nnot be established by probabilities or possibilities. \" Id. (quoting In re Oelrich, 666 F.2d 578, 581 \n(C.C.P.A. 1981)). A limitation \"necessaril y must be present\" to be inherent. Par Pharm., 773 \nF.3d at 1196. It is true that when \"(t]he unexpected properties of the claimed formulation ... \ndiffer in kind from the prior art,\" the formulation may be nonobvious . Allergan v. Sandoz, 796 \nF.3d at 1307. However, \"merely recit[ing] the unknown properties of an otherwise obvious \nformulation \" is not sufficient. Id. \nBecause each of the asserted claims has different Sa-related limitations , I consider the \nclaims one by one. \nClaim 3 of the '933 patent requires only that 8a be present in the composition . Plaintiffs \ndo not dispute that 8a was present in prior art compositions. (See D.I. 106 at 27-28). Therefore , \ncombined with my findings about 14-hydroxy above, I find that Defendant presented clear and \nconvincing evidence that Claim 3 is obvious. Plaintiffs object to the idea that finding 8a \ninherently present in the prior art is sufficient to establish a conclusion of obviousness because \n\"it was only after the inventors identified 8a and its surprising properties that they were able to \n44 achieve the high purity and low levels of 14-hydroxy as claimed.\" (D.I. 106 at 32-33). However , \nI am persuaded by Defendant's evidence that the identification of 8a itself was merely routine. \nAs a factual matter, I find that a POSA would have had the knowledge and skill not only to \nidentify 8a and determine its role but also to achieve low-ABUK levels without even identifying \n8a. Further, claim 3 in particular does not contain any reference to the role or purpose of 8a in \nthe composition. The patent does not claim the fact that 8a converts to 14-hydroxy . Plaintiffs cite \nto no law that indicates I should consider claim 3 to encompass that discovery . They simply \nrepeatedly state that the claim \"cannot be viewed in isolation.\" (Id. at 25, 32). \nPlaintiffs say that Defendant's theory that a POSA would inevitably discover 8a is \n\"prernise[d] ... on the teachings of the patent.\" (Id. at 38). However, Plaintiffs ' argument is \nequally tautological-since Plaintiffs never identified how a POSA could have been led astray, \nPlaintiffs ' argument seems to simply be that a POSA would not have discovered 8a because 8a \nwas nonobvious. For the purposes of determining that a POSA would have the knowledge and \nskill to discover 8a, I look to testimony provided by both sides' experts. The experts' testimony \npersuades me that a POSA would have quickly postulated and easily confirmed the existence of \n8a. Plaintiffs once again would have a POSA give up rather than engage in routine \nexperimentation, even in the face of external motivation. \nPlaintiffs ' protests that \"[t]here is no evidence that anyone was trying to reduce the level \nof 8~ to achieve low 14-hydroxy \" miss the point. (D.I. 107,r 87). As discussed previously , the \nmotivation to achieve low 14-hydroxy came from the FDA in 2002, so one would not expect \nevidence that anyone was trying to reduce the level of 8~ before then. There is no evidence in the \nrecord of what anyone other than the inventors was actually doing after 2002, so a lack of \nevidence that anyone was trying to reduce 8~ is unremarkable. To the extent that Plaintiffs use \n45 this observation to argue that a POSA would have known 8~ could not possibly be the source of \nthe problem (D.I. 106 at 38), I think that a POSA with such a belief would only be led more \ninevitably toward identifying 8a as a source of 14-hydroxy. As with the choice between an extra \nhydrogenation step and an earlier intervention , the improbability of one explanation for 14-\nhydroxy' s reappearance would only serve to further narrow a POSA's limited set of viable \noptions. I conclude that a POSA would seek to dehydrate 8a and 8~ based on the credible \ntestimony of Dr. Martin, not based on any evidence or lack thereof of what a particular \npharmaceutical manufacturer tried. \nI likewise do not find Plaintiffs ' arguments about the prior art studies of impurities \npersuasive, since those studies did not purport to be exhaustiv e. Proksa, for example, explicitly \nnotes that it only identified two of the impurities detected in the synthesis of oxycodone. (DTX-\n020 at 0001 ). Dr. Martin testified that a POSA would know how to analyze a mixture and \nidentify its component compounds using HPLC, mass spectrometry , or NMR spectrometry . (Tr. \nat 79: 17-81 :9). Plaintiffs presented no evidence that 8a would not be identifiable with these \nroutine techniques if a POSA bothered to try. Likewise , there was no evidence presented to \nsuggest that anyone, POSA or otherwise , tried and failed to identify 8a. \n8a's surprising reactivity also does not change the balance.12 Both experts testified that a \nPOSA would have expected 8a to be more reactive than 8~. (Tr. at 84:10-19, 575:5-24 ). The \ndegree to which 8a was more reactive may have been surprising , but even if 8a were only as \nreactive a POSA would have expected , Dr. Martin's testimony convincingl y indicates that a \n12 Surprising or unexpected results, like failure of others, are ordinarily secondary considerations \nof nonobviousness. Sud-Chemie , 554 F.3d at 1009. However , Plaintiffs do not present them as \nsuch. Again, I address the argument that Plaintiffs actually make: that because 8a's surprising \nreactivity was what kept 14-hydroxy levels high, a POSA would not have thought to look to 8a \nas the problem. \n46 POSA would still have gone down the path that led to the invention. Said another way, 8a's \nsurprising reactivity made it a surprisingl y important component of the solution to lowering 14-\nhydroxy, but a POSA would have recognized it as a component of the solution even without the \nreactivity. \nClaim 21 of the '919 patent additionally imposes a purity requirement that \"the ratio of \n8a,14-dihydroxy-7 ,8-dihydrocodeinone to oxycodone HCl is 0.04% or less as measured by \nHPLC.\" ('919 Patent at 36:16-17) . Defendant argues that equally low levels were inherently \ndisclosed in Lin. (O.I. 99 at 28-29). Defendant also argues that even if not disclosed in Lin, the \nlow levels would still have been obvious. (D.I. 106 at 19). Plaintiffs note that the parties \nstipulated , \"The prior art does not disclose, expressly or inherently , a composition wherein the \nratio of 8a to oxycodone is 0.04% or less as measured by HPLC.\" (D.I. 89-1 ,r 102). Plaintiffs \nalso argue that Defendant cannot rely on Lin since doing so requires assumptions and is \"pure \nspeculation.\" (D.I. 106 at 32). \nI think that the stipulation in the parties' Joint Statement of Uncontested Facts is \nconclusive on the issue of whether the limitation was inherently disclosed by Lin or any other \nreference-I must take as a fact that no prior art reference disclosed 8a levels below 0.04%. \nHowever, I still find that the limitation on the levels of 8a is obvious. As Plaintiffs themselves \nargue, \"the amount of 14-hydroxy depends on the levels of 8a, and the levels of 8a, 14-hydroxy , \nand other unintended side-reaction impurities can affect oxycodone purity.\" (D.I. 106 at 25). In \nfact, Dr. Martin testified that a POSA, having found that any 8a in the composition could be \nconverted to 14-hydroxy during salt formation , would seek to reduce the ratio of 8a to \noxycodone to well below 0.04%. This would be necessary to ensure the low 14-hydroxy levels \nthat the FDA was seeking. (Tr. at 99:19-100 :7). Dr. Martin also testified that a POSA would be \n47 able to monitor the levels of 8a. in order to reduce the ratio of 8a. to oxycodone. (Id. at 100:8-16) . \nDr. Wuest did provide any testimony to suggest that a POSA would not be able to do so. \nTherefore , I find that the limit on the level of 8a. relative to oxycodone would likewise be \nobvious to POSA conducting routine experimentation. \nFinally, claim 11 of the '933 patent requires \"removing [8a.] from an oxycodone base \ncomposition. \" ('933 Patent 34:54-55). Defendant argues that 8a. is always removed during the \nsalt formation step, because it is always converted to 14-hydroxy. (D.I. 99 at 29). Plaintiffs argue \nbriefly that a POSA who did not intend to reduce levels of 8P would not have \"removed\" 8a. but \ngenerally do not separately address claim 11. (D.I. 106 at 38). \nThe parties unfortunately do not address each other's arguments on removal head on, \nwith Defendant arguing that 8a. is always removed by the salt formation itself and Plaintiffs \nsuggesting that removal of 8a. could only occur if a POSA decided to remove 8p. However , I do \nnot think this dispute matters. Whether or not 8a. was removed in the prior art, its removal in the \ninvention itself is still the result of applying routine techniques to what a highly skilled POSA \nwould have seen as a simple problem-albeit one that nobody had previously given any thought \nto. Given that I have found that a POSA would have been able to routinely identify 8a. or 8P as \nthe source of extra 14-hydroxy, I find that removing 80., either directly or by removing 8P, is also \nobvious. \nI do not think Defendant 's theory is hindsight-driven. This is not a case where a POSA \nwould have to repeatedly choose correctly in a branching maze of paths forward. Instead, \nDefendant presented clear and convincing evidence that all a POSA would have had to do was \nrepeatedly choose the only path forward, rather than giving up. Plaintiffs ' expert did not provide \nplausible evidence to the contrary. \n48 The parties do not offer any argument about secondary considerations of nonobviousness \nfor any of the Low-ABUK patents. \nV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the foregoing reasons, I find claim 3 of the Mannion '933 patent, claim 3 of the '808 \npatent, claim 6 of the '886 patent, claims 3 and 11 of the '93 3 patent, and claim 21 of the '919 \npatent invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. \nThe parties shall submit a final judgment consistent with this memorandum opinion \nwithin one week. \n49 "}
