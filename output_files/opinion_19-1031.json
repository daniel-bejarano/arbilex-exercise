Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore me is Comcast\u2019s motion to strike NexStep\u2019s new damages theories .  (D.I. 317).  I \nheard  oral argument via teleconference on September 17, 2021.  After reviewing Comcast\u2019s \nletter (D.I. 318), NexStep\u2019s response (D.I. 321), and the documents discussed at oral argument, \nwhich are available as exhibits to D.I. 326, I indicated that I would grant  Comcast\u2019s motion .  \n(D.I. 363).  This opinion provides a f uller explanation of my decision. \nI.  BACKGROUND Plaintiff NexStep  filed this lawsuit against Defendant Comcast, alleging infringement of \nseveral patents relating to personal computing devices and services.  The parties cross -moved for \nsummary judgment and to exclude the opposing party\u2019s expert report s.  (D.I. 196, 197).  On \nSeptember 16, 2021, I issued an order granting Comcast\u2019s  motion to exclude the expert opinion \nof NexStep\u2019s  expert, Mr. Reading, regarding the hypothetical negotiation of c ost savings \nassociated with the Customer Troubleshooting Patents .  (D.I. 314).   \nThe next day\u2014the Friday before the trial \u2014the  parties met and conferred  regarding \nNexStep\u2019s  damages theories .  (D.I. 318 at 1).  Subsequently, Comcast  filed a motion to strike \nnew damages theories (D.I. 317) with a letter in support (D.I. 318) claiming that at the meet and confer, \u201cNexStep was unable to identify what the new alleged royalty rate would be.\u201d   (Id. at 1).  \nOn Friday afternoon, NexStep resp onded with a description of its damages theory.  (D.I. \n321).  NexStep proposed that NexStep\u2019s CEO , Dr. Stepanian , would give fact testimony  that \nNexStep\u2019s business plan during the relevant timeframe identified a 30% royalty rate for the Customer Troubleshooting patents and Mr. Reading would give an expert opinion \u201c establishing  \nwhat the cost savings would be and the parties\u2019 positioning at the hypothetical negotiation.\u201d   \n(D.I. 321 at 1, 4).   3 \n The parties dispute d the extent to which the facts and theories underlying NexStep\u2019s  \nproposed damages case were disclosed during discovery.  The issue is whether NexStep  met the \ndisclosure requirements of Rule 26, and, if not, whether I should nevertheless allow the evidence \nat trial under Rule 37(c)(1).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nRule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for initial \ndiscovery disclosures  including:   \na computation of each category of damages claimed by the disclosing party\u2014who must \nalso make available for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered [.] \nRule 26(a) \u201cdoes expressly require an initial computation and disclosure of the evidence that will \nbe relied on to the full extent the patent plaintiff could or should know of it.\u201d   Brandywine \nCommc\u2019ns Techs., LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 2012 WL 5504036 at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 13, 2012).  \n\u201cIf a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a)  \u2026, \nthe party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. \u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n37(c) (1).  The decision to exclude testimony at trial is a \u201c decision peculiarly within the discretion \nof the trial judge.\u201d   DCK TTEC, LLC v. Postel Indus., Inc., 602 F. App'x 895, 898 (3d Cir. 2015) \n(internal citations omitted).  In the Third Circuit, courts consider the Pennypack factors to \ndetermine whether exclusion of evidence is appropriate: \u201c(1) the prejudice or surprise in fact of the party against whom the excl uded witnesses would have testified, (2) the ability of that party \nto cure the prejudice, (3) the extent to which waiver of the rule against calling unlisted witnesses would disrupt the orderly and efficient trial of the case or other cases in the court, a nd (4) bad \nfaith or willfulness  in failing to comply with the district court's order. \u201d Konstantopoulos v. 4 \n Westvaco Corp., 112 F.3d 710, 719 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing Meyers v. Pennypack Woods Home \nOwnership Ass'n , 559 F.2d 894, 904\u201305 (3d Cir. 1977)).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nComcast  argued  that NexStep  failed to meet its Rule 26 disclosure requirements  because \nNexStep had not  previously identif ied a 30% royalty rate.  (D.I. 318 at 1- 2).  Comcast also \nargue d that NexStep should be precluded from offering Dr. Stepania n\u2019s testimony because  \nNexStep represented in interrogatories that the damages theory would be a matter of expert testimony, not testimony from a fact witness.  ( Id. at 2).  Finally, Comcast asserted that NexStep  \ncould not offer any of Mr. Reading\u2019s opinions  regarding the hypothetical negotiation based on \nmy September 16\nth order.  ( Id. (citing D.I. 196)).   \nNexStep responded that a business plan slide deck supporting a 30% royalty rate was \nincluded in NexStep\u2019s  response to Comcast\u2019s  Interrogatory No. 2.  That interrogatory \u201crelated to \nthe earliest making, using, selling, offering for sale, and disclosure\u201d of the inventions at issue.  (D.I. 321 at 3; see D.I. 326- 1 Ex. 3 at 19).  Part of the response to the interrogatory, dated \nNovember 27, 2020, was by citation to documents pursuant to Rule 33.  One such cited document was the slide deck.  The slide deck \u2014along with the rest of  Interrogatory No. 2\u2014was  \nthen incorporated by reference in the response, dated December 23, 2020, to Interrogatory  No. 9, \nrequesting NexStep\u2019s damages documents .  (D.I. 326- 1, Ex. 6 a t 9 (\u201cNexStep incorporates by \nreference its response to Interrogatory No. 2 regarding the benefits of t he technology of the \nAsserted Patents.\u201d ).  Furthermore, NexStep argued that Comcast had the opportunity to depose \nDr. Stepanian regarding his licensing efforts and failed to ask about the business plan slide deck.  \n(D.I. 326 at 4).  Finally, NexStep assert ed that my September 16\nth order only struck a portion of \nMr. Reading\u2019s report.  ( Id. at 3 -4). 5 \n The Federal Circuit recently considered Rule 26 disclosure of damages  in MCL Intell . \nProp ., LLC, v. Micron Tech., Inc., 10 F.4th 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  In that case, the  district court \nstruck  portions of an expert report because the plaintiff, MCL, failed to disclose \u201c what it \nbelieved was an appropriate royalty rate, that it believed the Hynix and Toshiba licenses reflect a \n0.25% royalt y rate, and the extrinsic evidence on which [the expert] relied in support of his \nbelief. \u201d  Id. at 1369.   \nThe Federal Circuit found that the district court erred in its finding that Plaintiff had not \nproduced the licenses  but upheld the district court\u2019s decision as \u201cwell within its discretion \u201d \nbecause, despite the production of the licenses, there was no way for defendant to know that the licenses reflected a .25% royalty rate.  Id. at 1370.  In short, the district court did not err in \nrequiring the plaintiff\u2019s Rule 26(a) damages disclosure to include the royalty rate and the factual underpinnings of the rate.  Cf. Shanghai Weiyi Int'l Trade Co. v. Focus 2000 Corp., 2017 WL 2840279, at *4 n.8 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 2017) (requi ring the plaintiff  to \u201cprovide sufficient detail \nto explain its calculations for each category of damages claimed, to identify the documents or other evidentiary materials that provided the bases for the calculations, \u2026 and to tie each step of its calculat ion to the specific documents or other evidentiary materials that support it.\u201d  (cleaned \nup)).  \nIn the case at hand, NexStep proposed a new  hypothetical negotiation theory on the last \nbusiness day\u2014a Frida y\u2014before trial.  The previous hypothetical negotiation started at an \narbitrary 50/50 split ( which I excluded, D.I. 314) and was adjusted to a 40% royalty rate based \non the  expert\u2019s consideration of the Georgia Pacific factors .  (See D.I. 216 Ex. V \u00b6 379) .  Under \nNexStep\u2019s new theory, t he hypothetical negotiation would be determined based on NexStep\u2019s \nplan for a 30%  royalty based on factual testimony  and the jury\u2019s  consideration of an appropriate 6 \n adjustment based on expert testimony about the Georgia Pacific factors.1  (D.I. 321).  NexStep \nargue d that each piece of the new damages theory was disclosed in some fashion\u2014the slide  \ndeck2 was incorporated by reference into the damages interrogatory and Comcast had the \nopportunity to depose Dr. Stepanian about his licensing efforts .  (D.I. 326 at 2- 4).  Despite this \npiecemeal disclosure, I find that NexStep did not meet  the disclosure requirements of  Rule 26(a).  \nNexStep failed to \u201cto tie each step of it s calculation to the specific documents or other \nevidentiary materials that support it.\u201d   Shanghai Weiyi Int'l Trade Co., 2017 WL 2840279, at *4 \nn.8 (cleaned up) .  It is not as though NexStep provided alternative damages theories, and the \nexclusion of one leaves another one to be litigated.  NexStep simply has cobbled together a new \ntheory using some parts of the old theory and some parts that were previously ignored by both sides.       \nThe Pennyp ack fa ctors counsel ed in favor of my decision to exclu de NexStep\u2019s damages \ntheory under Rule 37(c)(1).  There was  no bad faith on NexStep\u2019s part, but the inclusion of such \nevidence would have be en prejudicial to Comcast and Comcast would have  been unlikely to be \nable to cure that prejudice.  Comcast had been preparing to respond to an expert\u2019s opinion on \nNexStep\u2019s royalty rate , not factual testimony.  Allowing the new theory would have mean t that \nComcast could not have obtained  targeted discovery a round the factual basis of the theory.  See \nAgence France Presse v. Morel , 293 F.R.D. 682, 686 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)  (noting that courts have \nprecluded plaintiffs\u2019 damages theories \u201c where a party's failure to disclose its damages theory in a \n \n1 I have serious doubts that NexStep\u2019s  proposal could provide sufficient evidence that would lead \nto a jury verdict that could be upheld.  The 30% royalty rate \u2014which essentially appears to be a \nnumber plucked out of thin air and written by Dr. Stepanian into a business plan\u2014could \nrepresent what Dr. Stepanian wanted.  What about what Comcast wanted, though?  Without expert testimony, there is no basis for a starting point to which an expert can apply the Georgia Pacific  factors.  Without a starting point, talking about adjustments makes no sense . \n2 The relevant pages of the slide deck are at D.I. 326 -1, Ex. 2 at 248 & 256 of 268. 7 \n timely manner preven ted its adversary from pursuing discovery targeted at that theory.\u201d).  It is \nirrelevant that Comcast could have asked Dr. Stepanian pertinent  questions at his deposition.  \nComcast had no reason to ask questions about a theory that NexStep had not yet thought of or \ndisclosed.  Further, NexStep\u2019s new theory would require the jury to speculate about the ultimate royalty rate  based on testimony from NexStep\u2019s witnesses , and Comcast should have had the \nopportunity to prepare and present its own witnesses in rebu ttal.  The orderly and efficient trial \nof the case had already been disrupted, as, instead of one trial with liability and damages, we tried the liability portion since there was no possibility of ameliorating the prejudice to Comcast the weekend before trial.  Thus, I found that exclusion was appropriate under Rule 37(c)(1).  \nIV. CONCLUSION An appropriate order will issue.
