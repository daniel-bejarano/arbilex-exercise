INTRODUCTION \nMovant Tyree Miller has filed a Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. (D.I. 72} The United States filed an Answer in \nOpposition. (D.I. 107} For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny Movant's \u00a7 2255 \nMotion without holding an evidentiary hearing. \nII. BACKGROUND \nBetween August 2, 2018 and August 16, 2018, Movant and his co-defendants \ncommitted six armed commercial robberies (of three 7-Eleven Stores, one Royal Farms \nstore, one Wawa store, and Steve's Discount Liquors} and one unarmed demand-note \nbank robbery (Wells Fargo Bank}. (D.I. 66 at 4-5; D. I. 107 at 3-5) In each of the \ncommercial robberies, Movant entered the store wearing a mask and carrying a firearm, \nand demanded money and/or cigarettes. (D.I. 66 at 4; D.1.107 at 3-5; D.I. 107-1 at 23-\n24} During the August 9, 2018 bank robbery, Movant entered the bank and presented a \nnote to the teller which read, \"I'm not alone we need 4 envelopes All Hundreds calmly \nNobody dies!\" (D.I. 107 at 4) \nIn November 2018, a federal grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against \nMovant and two co-defendants, specifically charging Movant with the following three \ncounts: (1) bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and 2 (Count Six}; (2) \nHobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a} and 2 (Count Eight}; and (3) \nknowingly using, carrying, and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of \nviolence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c}(1} and (2) (Count Nine). (D.I. 2) On April 15, 2019, Movant waived indictment and pied guilty to a nine-count \nsuperseding information charging him with Hobbs Act Robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a71951(a) and 2 (Counts One, Two, Three, Five, Seven and Eight); using, carrying, and \nbrandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Counts Four and Nine); and bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2113 and 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 2113(a)(2) (Count Six). (D.I. 48; D.I. 49; D.I. 50) \nOn July 26, 2019, the Court sentenced Movant to a total of 216 months of \nimprisonment. (D.I. 71 at 3) \nIll. DISCUSSION \nClaims One through Six assert the following ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaims: (1) defense counsel failed to properly investigate the facts and discover if the \nvictims of his crimes would have testified against Movant had he elected to proceed to \ntrial, and also failed to file a motion to withdraw Movant's guilty plea on the ground that \nthere were no victims who would have testified (D.I. 72 at 1-2); (2) defense counsel did \nnot permit Movant's mother to see the discovery against Movant (D.I. 72 at 2, 8); (3) \ndefense counsel allowed Movant to be incarcerated with his co-defendants, which put \nhis life in danger and increased the likelihood that Movant's co-defendants could coerce \nMovant into accepting the plea offer for \"things they had done\" (D.I 72 at 2-3); (4) \ndefense counsel neglected to present the issue of Movant's \"mental disability\" to the \nCourt during Movant's plea and sentencing hearings (D.I. 72 at 3-5, 9); (5) defense \ncounsel did not move to suppress text messages recovered from Movant's phone and \ndid not disclose various miscellaneous information about Movant to the judge during the \n2 plea hearing (D.I. 72 at 5-6); and (6) defense counsel failed to object to certain issues \nand failed to provide miscellaneous information during the sentencing hearing to \nsupport a lesser sentence (including the issue of Movant's \"mental disability\"), and also \nimproperly instructed Movant not to write to the Court (D.I. 72 at 6-7, 9). In Claim \nSeven, Movant asserts that the Court was prejudiced against him and predetermined \nhis sentence (D.I. 72 at 7-8). \nA. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims \nMovant has properly raised his ineffective assistance allegations in a \u00a7 2255 \nMotion. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500 (2003). As a general rule, \nineffective assistance of counsel claims are reviewed pursuant to the two-pronged \nstandard established in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Both Strickland \nprongs must be satisfied in order for a movant to successfully show that defense \ncounsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance, and the Court can choose \nwhich prong to address first. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 668. \nUnder the first Strickland prong, a movant must demonstrate that \"counsel's \nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" with \nreasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel \nrendered assistance. Id. at 688. In evaluating an attorney's conduct, a court must avoid \n\"the distorting effects of hindsight\" and must \"evaluate the conduct from counsel's \nperspective at the time.\" Id. at 687. Under the second Strickland prong, a movant must \ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the outcome of the \nproceeding would have been different. See id. at 694; United States v. Nahodil, 36 F .3d \n3 323, 326 (3d Cir. 1994). In the context of a guilty plea, a movant satisfies Strickland's \nprejudice prong by demonstrating that, but for counsel's error, there is a reasonable \nprobability that he would have insisted on proceeding to trial instead of pleading guilty. \nSee Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58 (1985). The Strickland standard is highly \ndemanding and leads to a strong presumption that counsel's representation was \nprofessionally reasonable. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. \n1. Claim One: Defense counsel failed to investigate the case and \nproduce witnesses, and should have moved to withdraw Movant's \nplea \nClaim One asserts the following two sub-arguments: (1) the absence of victims at \nMovant's plea hearing should have prompted defense counsel to conduct an intense \ninvestigation to see if any victims would have appeared at trial to testify against him; \nand (2) defense counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion to withdraw Movant's \nguilty plea based on the argument that the Government would not have been able to \nproduce any victims had Movant proceeded to trial. Both sub-arguments are unavailing. \na. Failure to investigate availability of victims \nIt is well-settled that \"[s]olemn declarations in open court carry a strong \npresumption of verity\" that create a \"formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral \nproceedings.\" Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 74 (1977). Consequently, once a \ndefendant has entered a guilty plea, that defendant's \"subsequent presentation of \nconclusory allegations unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal, as are \ncontentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible.\" Id. \n4 Here, the transcript of Movant's plea colloquy contains his clear and explicit \nstatements that he discussed his case with defense counsel and that he was satisfied \nwith his counsels' representation. (D.I. 107-1 at 5, 19) Movant also stated that: (1) he \nhad been treated for ADHD (D.I. 107-1 at 4); (2) he was not under the influence of drugs \nand he understood what was going on during the change of plea hearing (D.I. 107-1 at \n4-5); (3) he understood the constitutional rights he was waiving by pleading guilty (D.I. \n107-1 at 5, 14, 21-22); (4) he was pleading guilty of his own free will because he was, in \nfact guilty, and he recounted the facts of the offenses he committed (D.I. 107-1 at 23-\n24); (5) he understood that the Government did not need to present any witnesses \nor evidence due to his decision to enter a guilty plea (D.I. 107-1 at 22) (emphasis \nadded); (6) he had not been promised anything not contained in the plea agreement \n(D.1. 107-1 at 13); (7) he was not forced or threatened to enter the plea agreement (D.I. \n107-1 at 13-14); and (8) he knew he faced a possible maximum statutory penalty of life \nimprisonment with a mandatory minimum sentence of 14 years of imprisonment (D.I. \n107-1 at 14-15). Movant has not presented any evidence or argument in this \nproceeding demonstrating why his explicit statements during the plea colloquy\u00ad\nincluding, but not limited to, statements that he was satisfied with defense counsel's \nrepresentation, he was guilty of the charged offenses, and that he understood his \ndecision to enter a guilty plea eliminated the need for the Government to produce any \nevidence or witnesses-should not be presumptively accepted as true. Therefore, \nbased on the aforementioned record, the Court concludes that defense counsel's \nalleged failure to investigate whether any victims would have attended a trial had \n5 Movant decided to proceed to trial did not amount to ineffective assistance under \nStrickland. \nb. Failure to file motion to withdraw plea \nMovant's contention that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to file a \nmotion to withdraw Movant's guilty plea based on the absence of victims at the plea \nhearing also does not warrant relief. As an initial matter, Movant's speculative \nassumption that the absence of victims at his plea hearing demonstrates that the \nGovernment would have been unable to call witnesses against him at trial is not \nsupported by the record. As the Government explains in its Response, it would have \npresented the testimony of the individuals who witnessed Movant's offenses, as well as \nvideos of each of the robberies. (D.I. 107 at 11) \nAdditionally, sub-argument two fails under Strickland's prejudice prong, because \nMovant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that a motion to withdraw his \nplea would have succeeded. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e), \"[i]f a \nmotion to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendre is made before sentence is \nimposed, the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair \nand just reason.\" Fed. R. Cr. P. 32(e). The defendant's burden of demonstrating a fair \nand just reason for withdrawing a plea is substantial. See United States v. Jones, 336 \nF.3d 245, 252 (3d Cir. 2003). A district court must consider three factors (the \"Jones' \nfactors\") when evaluating a motion to withdraw a guilty plea: (1) whether the defendant \nasserts his innocence; (2) the strength of the defendant's reasons for withdrawing the \nplea; and (3) whether the government would be prejudiced by the withdrawal. See \n6 Jones, 336 F.3d at 252; see also United States v. Brown, 250 F.3d 811, 818 (3d Cir. \n2001); United States v. Wilder, 204 F. App'x 146, 148 (3d Cir. 2006). The Third Circuit \nhas cautioned that a \"shift in defense tactics, a change of mind, or the fear of \npunishment are not adequate reasons to impose on the government the expense, \ndifficulty, and risk of trying a defendant who has already acknowledged his guilt by \npleading guilty.\" Jones, 336 F.3d at 252. Notably, a court does not need to determine if \nthe government would be prejudiced by the withdrawal of a guilty plea (factor three) if \nthe defendant fails \"to demonstrate that the other [two] factors support a withdrawal of \nthe plea.\" Id. at 253. \nTurning to the first Jones' factor, \"[o]nce a defendant has pleaded guilty, he must \nthen not only reassert innocence, but give sufficient reasons to explain why \ncontradictory positions were taken before the district court.\" Jones, 336 F.3d at 253. \nSignificantly, Movant never asserted his innocence during his plea hearing. Instead, as \ndemonstrated by the following exchange between Movant and the Court, Movant \nactually established the factual basis for the charges against him: \nCOURT: Are you pleading guilty of your own free will \nbecause you are guilty? \nMOVANT: Yes, sir. \nCOURT: So then tell me what in your own words makes \nyou think you should be pleading guilty. \nMOVANT: I went into the stores brandishing a gun and \nrobbed them. \nCOURT: And I just want to make sure I understand. So \nyou did that first for the 7-Eleven at 1901 \nCenterville in August? \n7 MOVANT: Yes sir. \nCOURT: 2018. And you did it with some other people? \nMOVANT: Yes sir. \nCOURT: Who were they? \nMOVANT: Fabian Evans and D'Andre Whittle. \nCOURT: And then you robbed the ?-Eleven at 284 \nChristiana Road in New Castle the next day? \nMOVANT: Yes sir. \nCOURT: And did you rob the Royal Farms at 3701 \nKirkwood Highway on August 5th? \nMOVANT: Yes, sir. \nCOURT: And when you robbed the Royal Farms on \nAugust 5th, did you brandish a firearm? \nMOVANT: Yes, sir. \nCOURT: And also on that date did you with a gun the?\u00ad\nEleven at 201 Market Street in Newport? \nMOVANT: Yes, sir. \nCOURT: On August 9, 2018, did you rob the Wells Fargo \nat 3215 Old Capital Train in Wilmington? \nMOVANT: Yes, sir. \nCOURT: On August 14th 2018, did you rob a Wawa at \n605 Yorklyn Road in Hockessin, Delaware? \nMOVANT: Yes, sir. \nCOURT: On August 16th 2018, did you rob with a firearm \nSteve's Discount Liquor at 1204 Centerville \nRoad in Wilmington, Delaware? \n8 MOVANT: Yes, sir. \nCOURT: And did you brandish a firearm when you \nrobbed the Steve's Discount Liquors on August \n16th? \nMOVANT: Yes, sir. \n(D.I. 107-1 at 31) Following this exchange between the Court and Movant, the \nGovernment presented a summary of the extensive evidence it would have presented \nhad Movant elected to go to trial, and the Court again verified that Movant was \nacknowledging his guilt: \nCOURT: \nMovant: \n(D.I. 107-1 at 31) [Movant], do you agree that the prosecutor has \naccurately summarized the evidence she would \npresent at trial? \nYes, sir. \nAlso noteworthy is the fact that Movant does not assert his actual innocence in \nthis proceeding, nor does he provide any reason explaining why he took the \ncontradictory position of admitting his guilt during the plea hearing. Given all these \ncircumstances, the Court concludes that the first Jones' factor would have weighed \nagainst allowing Movant to withdraw his plea. \nWith respect to the second Jones' factor, Movant asserts that defense counsel \nshould have moved to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that no victims attended \nhis plea hearing. Although Movant contends that the absence of victims at his plea \nhearing demonstrates that the Government would have been unable to call any victims \nto testify against him had he proceeded to trial, this contention constitutes mere \n9 speculation rebutted by the Government's Response and does not provide a sufficient \nreason to withdraw his guilty plea. Thus, the Court concludes that the second Jones' \nfactor would have weighed against allowing Movant to withdraw his plea.1 \nHaving found that Movant failed to assert his innocence and failed to meet his \nburden of showing a sufficient reason to withdraw his plea, the Court need not consider \nwhether the Government would suffer prejudice if the plea were withdrawn. Therefore, \nbased on the foregoing analysis, the Court concludes that any attempt on Movant's part \nto withdraw his guilty plea would have been futile. \nIt is well-settled that an attorney does not provide ineffective assistance by failing \nto present meritless arguments. See United States v. Sanders, 165 F.3d 248, 253 (3d \nCir. 1999). Having determined that Movant's underlying argument for filing a motion to \nwithdraw his guilty plea-namely, that the Government would have been unable to \nproduce any victims during a trial-lacks merit, Movant cannot demonstrate a \nreasonable probability that the Court would have granted a motion to withdraw Movant's \nguilty plea if defense counsel had filed one. Thus, defense counsel did not provide \n1To the extent defense counsel's '1errors\" alleged in Claims Two through Five should be \nconsidered together and treated as an additional reason for the purposes of the second \nJones' factor analysis, the Court would still conclude that Movant has failed to provide \nan adequate reason for withdrawing his guilty plea. As explained in the Court's \nsubsequent discussion concerning Claims Two through Five, the Court accepts as true \nthe assertions Movant made under oath during his plea colloquy that he was satisfied \nwith counsel's representation, that he was knowingly and willingly entering his guilty \nplea, and that he was, in fact, guilty as charged. See infra at Section I11.A.2. Since the \nrecord belies the \"errors\" Movant attributes to defense counsel in Claims Two through \nFive, those \"errors\" would not have provided support for granting a motion to withdraw \nMovant's plea. \n10 ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to withdraw Movant's guilty plea on the \nground he suggests. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim One in its entirety. \n2. Claims Two through Five: Defense counsel provided ineffective \nassistance for assorted reasons during the plea process \nIn Claims Two through Five, Movant contends that defense counsel provided \nineffective assistance by: (a) not permitting Movant's mother to see the discovery \nagainst him (Claim Two) (D.I. 72 at 2, 8); (b) permitting Movant to be incarcerated with \nhis co-defendants, because the proximity to his co-defendants put his life in danger and \nincreased the likelihood that Movant's co-defendants could coerce Movant into \naccepting the pleas for \"things they had done\" (Claim Three) (D.I 72 at 2-3); (c) failing to \nhave the Court consider Movant's \"mental disability\" (i.e., the fact that he has a learning \ndisability and suffers from attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and that he was \nsuicidal) at his plea hearing (Claim Four) (D.I. 72 at 3-5, 9); and (d) failing to move to \nsuppress text messages recovered from Movant's phone (Claim Five) (D.I. 72 at 6-7). \nAs previously discussed, Movant's unsupported allegations in Claims Two \nthrough Five fail to provide compelling evidence as to why the statements he made \nduring the plea hearing-e.g., that he was satisfied with defense counsel's \nrepresentation and he was, in fact, guilty-should not be presumptively accepted as \ntrue. Having no cause to doubt the veracity of Movant's statements at the time of his \nplea hearing provides a sufficient basis for concluding that defense counsel did not \nprovide ineffective assistance as asserted in Claims Two through Five. The Court also \n11 concludes that Claims Two through Five do not warrant relief for the following additional \nreasons. \nClaims Two and Five-which allege that defense counsel committed the non\u00ad\njurisdictional2 pre-plea \"errors\" of not permitting his mother to see the discovery against \nhim and failing to move to suppress texts on his phone-were waived when Movant \nentered his guilty plea. See Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973) (\"When a \ncriminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the \noffense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims \nrelating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the \nguilty plea.\"); Menna v. New York, 423 U.S. 61, 62 n. 2 (1975) (explaining that \nvoluntary and knowing guilty plea bars a defendant from raising antecedent non\u00ad\njurisdictional constitutional violations \"not logically inconsistent with the valid \nestablishment of factual guilt and which do not stand in the way of conviction if factual \nguilt is established.'). \nClaims Three and Four-which assert that defense counsel was ineffective for \nfailing to recognize that Movant's incarceration with his co-defendants somehow \ncoerced him to plead guilty and for not presenting the issue of Movant's incompetence \nto the Court during Movant's plea hearing-were not waived by Movant's guilty plea, \nbecause the alleged errors challenge the voluntariness of the plea itself. See, e.g., \n2As noted by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the term non-jurisdictional is \nsomewhat confusing and \"[t]he most accurate statement of the law would be ... [that a] \nguilty plea waives all defenses except those that go to the court's subject-matter \njurisdiction and the narrow class of constitutional claims involving the right not to be \nhaled into court.\" United States v. Devaughn, 694 F.3d 1141, 1193 (10th Cir. 2012). \n12 United States v. Lora, 2021 WL 4622255, at *1 n. 5 (3d Cir. Oct. 7, 2021). \nNevertheless, neither Claim warrants relief. During his plea hearing, Movant explicitly \nstated that he had not been threatened or forced into entering a guilty plea, and that he \nunderstood he would not be able to withdraw his plea at a later date on this basis since \nhe could have shared such threats with the Court during the plea colloquy. (D.I. 107-1 \nat 13-14) In this proceeding, Movant does not allege that being housed in proximity with \nhis co-defendants actually coerced him to enter a guilty plea. Rather, Movant alleges \nthat defense counsel was ineffective for failing to recognize the possibility that Movant \nmay have felt coerced into pleading guilty as a result of his being housed in the same \ncorrectional institution. Movant's unsupported and speculative assertion does not rebut \nthe presumption of truthfulness attached to the statements he made during his plea \nhearing. \nAs for Claim Four's assertion that defense counsel failed to raise the issue of \nMovant's \"mental disabilities\" to the Court, the record lacks \"sufficient indicia\" of \nMovant's alleged incompetence to establish defense counsel's ineffective assistance. \nSee Jermyn v. Horn, 266 F.3d 257, 283, 300 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that counsel's \nfailure to inquire into a defendant's competency and/or request a competency hearing \ncan constitute ineffective assistance if there are sufficient indicia of incompetence to \ngive objectively reasonable counsel reason to doubt the defendant's competency). The \nonly \"mental disabilities\" Movant explicitly identifies in his Motion are his learning \ndisability, diagnosis of ADHD, and the fact that he was suicidal at some point in time. \n(D.I. 72 at 3-5) Since Movant is proceeding prose, the Court liberally construes \n13 Movant's assertion that he suffered from \"mental disabilities\" to include the information \nconcerning his mental health set forth in the PSR. (See D.I. 70 at 18-20) According to \nthe PSR, Movant has participated in mental health counseling \"on and off since he was \nsixteen years old\" and is currently taking an antidepressant, although he is not suffering \nfrom a major mental disorder. (D.I 70 at 30) \nThe fact that a person suffers from mental illness and is taking medication for \nthat mental illness does not, on its own, provide a reason to doubtthe person's \ncompetency to stand trial. See Jermyn, 266 F .3d at 293. A person is competent to \nstand trial when he has a \"sufficient present ability to consult with [his] lawyer with a \nreasonable degree of rational understanding\" and possesses \"a rational as well as \nfactual understanding of the proceedings against [him].\" Dusky v. United States, 362 \nU.S. 402 (1960). \"To be legally incompetent, [the person's] mental illness must have \nrendered [him] unable to consult with [his] attorney or understand the proceedings at the \ntime of trial.\" Cherys v. United States, 552 F. App'x 162 (3d Cir. Jan. 9, 2014). \n\"[E]vidence of a defendant's irrational behavior, [his] demeanor at trial, and any prior \nmedical opinion on competence to stand trial are all relevant in determining whether \nfurther inquiry is required, but ... even one of these factors standing alone may, in some \ncircumstances, be sufficient.\" Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 180 (1974). \nIn this case, prior to entering the guilty plea, the Court asked Movant if he had \never been treated for any form of mental illness, to which Movant responded, \"No. \nADHD.11 (D.I. 107-1 at 4) The Court then asked Movant if he understood what was \ngoing on, and whether he had discussed the charges and plea agreement with defense \n14 counsel. Movant answered these questions affirmatively. (D.I. 107-1 at 5-7) The Court \nalso asked defense counsel whether he had any reason to doubt Movant's competence \nto proceed, to which defense counsel responded, \"I do not, Your Honor.\" (Id. at 5) \nNotably, Movant never mentioned the issue of his competency and the Court's thorough \ncolloquy did not suggest that Movant's competency was at issue. Given the absence of \n\"sufficient indicia of incompetence,\" the Court concludes that Claim Four fails to warrant \nrelief. See, e.g., Taylor v. Horn, 504 F.3d 416,439 (3d Cir. 2007). \nIn sum, based on the aforementioned record, the Court concludes that the \narguments presented in Claims Two through Five fail to satisfy either prong of the \nStrickland standard. \n3. Claim Six: Defense counsel provided ineffective assistance \nduring the sentencing hearing \nIn Claim Six, Movant asserts that defense counsel provided ineffective \nassistance during his sentencing hearing by: (a) failing to present evidence of Movant's \nmental health problems and failing to present information provided to the probation \nofficer by his mother; (b) failing to inform the Court that Movant did not have a prior \nrecord; (c) failing to object to evidence of his marijuana use; (d) failing to present any \ntestimony from his family or friends; and (e) instructing Movant not to write to the Court. \n(D.I. 72 at 6, 8-9) The Presentence Report (PSR), sentencing memorandum filed by \ndefense counsel, and transcript of the sentencing hearing belie Movant's assertions and \ndemonstrate that Movant cannot satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland. \nFor instance, the PSR explains that Movant reported using marijuana beginning \nat age 13 and continuing until the date of his arrest. (D.I. 70) During the sentencing \n15 hearing, Movant affirmed that he began using marijuana at age 13 and used it \"pretty \nmuch every day.\" (D.I. 107-2 at 29) Given the PSR's discussion of Movant's marijuana \nuse and Movant's own admission during sentencing about his marijuana use, defense \ncounsel had no basis to object to the evidence of Movant's marijuana use. \nThe PSR also contains extensive information about Movant's mental health \nhistory and includes details provided by his mother, and defense counsel's sentencing \nmemorandum references Movant's mental health history, including a Psychological \nEvaluation prepared by Jeffrey E. Summerton, Ph.D. (D.1. 63 at 7) In addition, defense \ncounsel provided the Court with Dr. Summerton's Psychological Evaluation, the \nRelease Summary of the Delaware Psychiatric Center, and the Psychological \nAssessment prepared by Earl E. Walker, Jr. (See Defense letter to Court with \nsubmissions, D.I. 67 and D.I. 68) Thus, contrary to his assertion, defense counsel did \nprovide the Court with information regarding Movant's mental health. \nAs for Movant's contention that defense counsel did not alert the Court that he \nhad no prior record, both the PSR and defense counsel's sentencing memorandum \nstate that Movant had never been in jail before and that he had no criminal history \npoints. (D.I. 63 at 9-10) Similarly, despite Movant's contention that defense counsel did \nnot present any testimony from family or friends, defense counsel submitted letters of \nsupport from three individuals who knew Movant (D.I. 68) and, at the beginning of the \nsentencing hearing, alerted the Court to the presence of several individuals who were \nthere in support of Movant and presented the testimony of Movant's step-father. (D.I. \n107-2 at 9-17) \n16 Movant also contends that defense counsel instructed him not to write to the \nCourt, and he lists several items that he might have wanted to tell the Court. Yet, the \ntranscript of the sentencing hearing reveals that Movant actually did address the Court \nbut never mentioned any of the possible topics listed in this proceeding. Moreover, \nMovant told the Court he was happy with defense counsel's representation. \nFinally, the transcript of the sentencing hearing shows that the Court \nacknowledged reviewing the PSR, psychological reports and assessments, letters of \nsupport on behalf of Movant, and the Government's and Movant's sentencing \nmemoranda. \nIn short, the record demonstrates that the Court was aware of all the relevant \ninformation Movant alleges defense counsel failed to provide the Court for sentencing. \nAccordingly, Movant cannot demonstrate prejudice, and the Court will deny Claim Six \nas meritless. \nB. Claim Seven: The Court Imposed a Predetermined Sentence \nParagraph Fifteen of the Memorandum of Plea Agreement contains the following \nappellate/collateral attack waiver: \nThe Defendant knows that he has, and voluntarily and \nexpressly agrees to waive, the right to file any appeal, \nany collateral attack, or any other writ or motion in this \ncriminal case after sentencing -including, but not \nlimited to, an appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 or 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1291, or a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the defendant reserves \nhis right (1) file an appeal or other collateral motion on \nthe grounds that he received ineffective assistance of \ncounsel; and (2) to appeal his sentence if: (a) the \ngovernment appeal from the sentence, (b) the \ndefendant's sentence exceeds the statutory maximum \n17 for the offense set forth in the United States Code, or \n(c) the sentence unreasonably exceeds the Sentencing \nGuideline range determined by the District Court in \napplying the United States Sentencing Guidelines. \n(D.I. 70 at ,r15) In Claim Seven, Movant contends that the Court was biased against \nhim and predetermined his sentence. Since this Claim does not allege ineffective \nassistance of counsel, the Court must determine if the Claim falls within the purview of \nthe collateral attack waiver. \nThe validity of an appellate/collateral attack waiver provision is a \"threshold issue \nthat must be addressed before reaching the merits of the underlying claim. 3 See United \nStates v. Mabry, 536 F.3d 231, 237 (3d Cir. 2008). As a general rule, courts will enforce \na defendant's waiver of his appellate/collateral rights if it is \"entered knowingly and \nvoluntarily and [its] enforcement does not work a miscarriage of justice.\" Id. at 236-37. \nA court has an affirmative and \"an independent obligation to conduct an evaluation of \nthe validity of a collateral waiver.\" Id. at 238. Specifically, a court must consider: (1) \nwhether the waiver was knowing and voluntary; (2) whether there is an exception to the \nwaiver which prevents its enforcement; and (3) whether enforcement of the waiver \nwould cause a miscarriage of justice. See United States v. Goodson, 544 F.3d 529, \n536 (3d Cir. 2008). \n3The collateral attack waiver does not preclude Movant from raising a claim of \nineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, the Court did not need to consider the validity \nof the waiver prior to addressing Movant's ineffective assistance of counsel allegations \nin Claims One through Six in Section Ill.A. \n18 The Court and the Government specifically addressed the appeal waiver at \nMovant's plea colloquy (D.I. 107-1 at 11), and the record clearly demonstrates that \nMovant understood the waiver's significance: \nGOVERNMENT: Paragraph 15 acknowledges that \n[Movant] has specifically waived certain \nrights of appeal, including a direct \nappeal or a collateral attack. \n(D.I. 107-1 at 11) \n* \nCOURT: \nMOVANT: \nCOURT: \nMOVANT: * * * \nSo if I look at paragraph 15 of your plea \nagreement, it says that you know and \nyou have voluntarily and expressly \nwaived the right to file any appeal, any \ncollateral attack, and that's like a writ of \nhabeas corpus. You've probably heard \nof that. Right? \nNo, sir. \nThere's a thing called habeas corpus. It \nmeans if somebody is in prison \nunlawfully in violation of the constitution, \nthey can file a motion, but you're giving \nup largely that right and your right to \nappeal the sentence and with a couple \nof exceptions, and let's talk about the \nexceptions, where you keep your right to \nappeal or file a collateral attack. \nFirst of all, you could on the grounds \nthat you received ineffective assistance \nof counsel. \nDo you understand that? \nYes, sir. \n19 COURT: \nMOVANT: \nCOURT: \nMOVANT: \nCOURT: \nMOVANT: \nCOURT: \nMOVANT: \n(D.I. 107-1 at 19-20) Now, in this case, you received the \nadvice of [defense counsel]. Do you \nhave any reason to believe or do you \nbelieve now that he has given you \nineffective assistance of counsel? \nNo, sir. \nHave you been happy with his \nrepresentation of you? \nYes, sir. \nAnd you've had an opportunity to \ndiscuss with him and ask him all the \nquestions you might have about this \nproceeding and your plea. \nIs that right? \nYes, sir. \nNow, you would also have the right to \nappeal your sentence if the Government \nappeals from the sentence. You would \nalso have the right to appeal your \nsentence or file a collateral attack if the \nsentence exceeded the statutory \nmaximum. It's not going to do that. I'm \nnot going to exceed the statutory \nmaximum. \nAnd, finally, you would have the right to \nfile an appeal or file a collateral attack if \nthe sentence unreasonably exceeded \nthe sentencing guidelines range \ndetermined by the Court in applying the \nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines. \nAnd do you understand that? \nYes, sir. \n20 After questioning Movant further during the plea colloquy, the Court found that \nMovant \"is fully competent and capable of entering an informed plea, that his plea of \nguilty is a knowing and voluntary plea supported by an independent basis in fact \ncontaining each of the essential elements of the offenses.\" (D.1. 107-1 at 32) Given \nthese circumstances, the Court concludes that Movant has failed to demonstrate that \nhis appellate/collateral waiver was not knowing and voluntary. \nThe Court also finds that Movant's challenge to his sentence as asserted in \nClaim Seven falls within the scope of the waiver. According to the waiver provision, \nMovant waived \"any collateral attack\" after sentencing, including\u00a7 2255 motions. None \nof the exceptions to the waiver apply to Movant's Claim. For example, the Government \ndid not appeal the sentence, and Movant does not challenge his sentence on the \nground that it exceeds the statutory limits or unreasonably exceeds the sentencing \nguideline range determined by the Court in applying the sentencing guidelines. \nTherefore, Claim Seven does not prevent the enforcement of the waiver. \nFinally, the Court must determine if enforcing the waiver will result in a \nmiscarriage of justice. When determining whether a miscarriage of justice will occur if \nthe waiver were enforced, there is no specific list of circumstances that would constitute \na miscarriage of justice. Mabry, 536 F .3d at 242. Rather, a court must apply a \ncommonsense approach and evaluate \"the clarity of the error, its gravity, its character \n(e.g., whether it concerns a fact issue, a sentencing guideline, or a statutory maximum), \nthe impact of the error on the defendant, the impact of correcting the error on the \ngovernment and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\" United \n21 States v. Khattak, 273 F.3d 557,563 (3d Cir. 2001). To that end, granting an exception \nto a waiver based on a miscarriage of justice must be done \"sparingly and without \nundue generosity,\"4 and only where \"manifest injustice\" would result by enforcing the \nwaiver. See United States v. Gwinnett, 483 F .3d 200, 206 (3d Cir. 2007). \nA consideration of the Khattak factors demonstrates that the enforcement of \nMovant's waiver would not work a miscarriage of justice. First, Movant cannot \ndemonstrate the \"gravity of the alleged error\" because he derived a benefit by entering \ninto the plea agreement. See Mabry v. Sharte/, 632 F. App'x 707, 711 (3d Cir. 2015) \n(\"because [Movant] entered into a plea agreement, he cannot demonstrate the gravity of \nthe alleged error.\") If Movant had proceeded to trial and had been found guilty of \nCounts Four and Nine, he faced a possible maximum statutory penalty of life in prison. \n(D.I. 107-1 at 15) By entering a plea agreement, however, the Government agreed to \nnot oppose a two-level reduction in the offense level for Movant's affirmative \nacceptance of responsibility, and also agreed to move to reduce the offense level by \none additional level if Movant's offense level was greater than sixteen prior to the \napplication of the acceptance of responsibility reduction. (D.I. 50 at 3-4) Pursuant to its \nsentencing memorandum, the Government recommended a sentence of eighteen years \nof imprisonment, which represented a request for a 30-month downward variance. (D.I. \n66 at 1; D.I. 107-2 at 22) The Court imposed an 18-year sentence, noting that it \nreflected a 30-month downward variance. (D.I. 71; D.I. 107-2 at 31) \n4United States v. Wilson, 429 F.3d 455,458 (3d Cir. 2005). \n22 Second, the Government would be adversely impacted if Movant were permitted \nto challenge his sentence. Not enforcing the collateral waiver would circumvent the \ngatekeeping requirements of\u00a7 2255 and provide an alternative route for more prisoners \nto challenge the propriety of their sentences. See Mabry, 632 F. App'x at 711. \nFinally, Movant agreed to the result of the waiver, and permitting Movant to avoid \nthe waiver would corrupt the bargain reached between Movant and the Government. \nSee Khattak, 273 F.3d at 561 (\"Allowing defendants to retract waivers would prolong \nlitigation, affording defendants the benefits of their agreements while shielding them \nfrom their self-imposed burdens.\"). Thus, after considering the Khattak factors, the \nCourt concludes that enforcing the collateral attack waiver at issue will not result in a \nmiscarriage of justice. \nHaving determined that the waiver was knowing and voluntary, and that its \nenforcement will not result in a miscarriage of justice, the Court concludes that the \ncollateral attack waiver in this case is valid. Accordingly, the Court will enforce Movant's \nvalid collateral attack waiver and dismiss Claim Seven on that basis. 5 \n5Even if the collateral attack waiver did not bar the Court from considering Claim Seven, \nthe Court would dismiss the Claim as meritless. Although the Court did comment during \nthe sentencing hearing that it had been prepared to sentence Movant to at least 19 \nyears, the Court explained that, after hearing from all parties, it had concluded that 18 \nyears was appropriate. (D.I. 107-2 at 31) The record demonstrates that the Court \nreached this conclusion after conducting a very thorough sentencing proceeding, which \nincluded reviewing the PSR, the letters submitted by defense counsel, the psychological \nevaluation, and the sentencing memoranda from the Government and the defense. \n(D.I. 107-2 at 2-4) The sentence reflected the 30-month downward variance requested \nby Movant. (D.I. 107-2 at 31) All these circumstances rebut Movant's baseless \nassertion that the Court was prejudiced against him and predetermined his sentence. \n23 IV. MOTIONS \nPetitioner filed four motions during the pendency of the proceeding: (1) two \nMotions to Appoint Counsel (D.I. 76; D.I. 105); (2) a Motion to Compel Full Discovery \n(D.I. 89); and (3) a Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis (D.I. 91 ). Having concluded \nthat the instant\u00a7 2255 Motion does not warrant relief, the Court will dismiss as moot the \nMotions to Appoint Counsel and the Motion to Compel Discovery. Additionally, the \nCourt will dismiss the Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis as unnecessary, because \nthere is no fee for filing a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2255. See Rule 3, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2255 (advisory committee notes). \nV. EVIDENTIARY HEARING \nA district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion filed \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 if the \"motion and the files and records of the case \nconclusively show\" that the movant is not entitled to relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; see also \nUnited States v. Booth, 432 F.3d 542, 545-46 (3d Cir. 2005); United States v. McCoy, \n410 F.3d 124, 131 (3d Cir. 2005); Rule 8(a), 28 U.S.C. foll.\u00a7 2255. The record \nconclusively demonstrates that Movant is not entitled to relief under\u00a7 2255. Therefore, \nthe Court concludes that an evidentiary hearing is not warranted. \nVI. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion must also decide \nwhether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011 ). A \ncertificate of appealability is appropriate only if the movant \"has made a substantial \n24 showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The movant \nmust \"demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of \nthe constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\" Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,484 \n(2000). \nThe Court has concluded that Claims One through Six in the instant\u00a7 2255 \nMotion lack merit, and Claim Seven is barred by the Plea Agreement's collateral attack \nwaiver provision. Reasonable jurists would not find this assessment debatable. \nTherefore, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability. \nVII. CONCLUSION \nThe Court concludes that Movant is not entitled to relief pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Criminal Procedure 33 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n25 "}
