RONALD FREDERICK, et al., \nDefendants. \nJohn E. Miller,James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware . Pro Se Plaintiff. \nAnna E. Currier, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, Wilmington, \nDelaware. Counsel for Defendants . \nMarch 28, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION I. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff John E. Miller (''Plaintiff\"), an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in \nSmyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 198 . (D.I. 1) He appears prose and has \npaid the filing fee. (D.I. 6) Before the Court is Defendants ' motion to dismiss. (D.I. 18) \n11. BACKGROUND \nThe Court screened this matter on October 6, 2020, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), and \nfound that Plaintiff had raised what appeared to be cognizable and non-frivolous 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \nclaims. (D.I. 9) Defendant s move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires the \nCourt to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 223 \n(3d Cir. 2004). \"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant \nis entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\" In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d \n1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court may grant such a \nmotion to dismiss only if, after \"accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and \nviewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Maio v. Aetna, \nInc., 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions . See Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bel/At/. Corp. v. Twombjy, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A plaintiff \nmust plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility . See Johnson v. City of \nShelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not dismissed, however, for imperfect statements of \nthe legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \n1 \"To survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that 'raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if \ndoubtful in fact).\"' Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombfy, 550 \nU.S. at 555). A claim is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. At bottom, \"[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable \nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\" of a plaintiff's claim. \nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \"bald assertions,\" Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \"unsupported conclusions and \nunwarranted inferences,\" Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Penn-!Jlvania Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405, \n417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \"self-evidently false,\" Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d \nCir. 1996). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \n\"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted \nby lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIV. DISCUSSION \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See \ne.g., Tourscherv. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \nstandard to dismissal for failure to state claim under\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). The Court screened this case, \nliberally construed it, and determined that Plaintiff has raised cognizable and non-frivolous claims. \n(See D.I. 9) \n2 Defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that the C mplaint fails to articulate specific \nclaims against either Defendant and appears to make general claims regarding retaliation and due \nprocess violations against both Defendants, due to a disciplinary report written by Defendant \nRonald Frederick (\"Frederick \") and a finding of guilt by Defendant Lt. Ruth Dixon (\"Dixon\"). \n(D.I. 18) Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not pled sufficient retaliation claims and that Plaintiffs \ndue process rights were not violated as a result of the disciplinary hearing. \nIn reviewing and liberally construing the Complaint, the Court finds that it adequatel y alleges \nretaliation claims against Frederick and against Dixon. The Complaint fails, however, to state a \nsecond retaliation claim against Dixon based on the June 20, 2019 conversation with Plaintiff. \nIn order to establish a retaliation claim, Plaintiff must allege that: (1) his conduct was \nconstituti onally protected ; (2) he suffered an adverse action at the hands of prison officials; and \n(3) his constitutionall y protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to \ndiscipline him. See Watson v. RoZ!-'m, 834 F.3d 417, 420 (3d Cir. 2016). \nAs Defendants point out, the Complaint does not alleges that Plaintiff suffered an adverse \naction. Rather, it alleges that Dixon was \"looking for a reaso \"to send Plaintiff to SHU, not that \nshe sent him there. For this reason, the June 20, 2019 retalia on claim fails. \nA closer look at the Complaint indicates that it fails t state a due process claim. Plaintiff \nalleges he was denied his job, good time credits, and a single ell spot as a result of the initial finding \nof guilt, yet none of those deprivations affect a protected liberty interest. The Due Process Clause \nitself confers no liberty interest in freedom from state action taken \"within the sentence imposed.\" \nSandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472,480 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). State created liberty \ninterests protected by the Due Process Clause are generally limited to restraints on prisoners that \nimpose an \"atypical and significant hardship on the inmate \u00b7 relation to the ordinary incidents of \n3 prison life.\" Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484). \nThe deprivations of which Plaintiff complains do not fall within this category. \nIn addition, to the extent Plaintiff alleges that he did not receive the procedural due process \nhe was due, he cannot prevail, given there were no restraints on his freedom. See Mitchell v. Horn, \n318 F.3d 523, 531 (3d Cir. 2003). Finally, to the extent he complains that the disciplinary charge \ncontained incorrect information, the filing of false disciplinary charges does not constitute a claim \nunder \u00a7 1983 so long as the inmate was granted a hearing and an opportunity to rebut the charges. \nSee Crosby v. Piazza, 465 F. App'x 168, 172 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 653-\n54 (3d Cir. 2002)). It is clear from the allegations that Plaintiff was afforded a disciplinary hearing. \nDefendants' motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiff will be \ngiven leave to file an amended complaint to correct the pleading deficiencies. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendants' motion to \ndismiss. (D.I. 18) Plaintiff will be given leave to amend. Should Plaintiff fail to file an amended \ncomplaint, the matter will proceed only on the March 23, 2018 retaliation claim against Frederick \nand the March 28, 2018 retaliation claim against Dixon. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n4 "}
