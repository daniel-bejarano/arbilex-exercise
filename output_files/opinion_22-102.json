No. 22- 102 (MN)  \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n  At Wilmington this 30th  day of March 2023:  \nAs announced at the hearing on February 17, 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the \ndisputed claim term of U.S. Patents No s. 10,226,376 (\u201cthe \u2019376 Patent\u201d)  and 10,390,989 (\u201cthe \u2019989 \nPatent\u201d)  is construed as follows:  \n1. \u201cfluid reservoir \u201d / \u201creservoir \u201d will be given its  plain and ordinary meaning, \nwhich is \u201ca space where urine can collect. \u201d (\u2019376 Patent, 1, 5 and 10; \u2019989 \nPatent  2, 3, 6 and 7) . \nThe parties  have previously litigated these patents which resulted in a jury verdict of \ninfringement and no inva lidity  in PureWick Corporation v. Sage Products , LLC , C.A. No. 19-\n1508- MN (\u201cPureWick I\u201d).  In PureWick I, the parties did not raise any claim construction dispute \nfor the term \u201cfluid reservoir\u201d or \u201creservoir.\u201d  In connection with the present case, Plaintiff filed a \nmotion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12( c) on the grounds that \ncollateral estopp el and res judic ata barred certain of Defendant\u2019s defenses.  ( D.I. 12).  During oral \nargument on the motion, the parties  identified this claim construction dispute , and the Court agreed \nto hear the issue in an expedited manner to rule on the pending motion.  The parties briefed the issues ( see D.I. 94; D.I. 105) and submitted exhibits  that included the patent s at issue , excerpts \nfrom the patents\u2019 prosecution histories , expert testimony from PureWick I and other  extrinsic 2 evidence (see D.I. 95; D.I. 105).  The Court carefully reviewed all submissions in connection with \nthe parties\u2019 contentions regarding the disputed claim term, heard oral argument ( see D.I. 116) and \napplied the following legal standards in reaching its decision:  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n574 U.S. 318, 325 (2015).  \u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill \nin the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omit ted).  Although \u201cthe claims themselves provide substantial \nguidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms,\u201d the context of the surrounding words of the claim must also be considered.  Id.  at 1314.  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meani ng \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201cis always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a  disputed term.\u201d  Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, \nInc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201cthe specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwis e possess.  In such cases, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201cEven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demon strated a clear intention to \nlimit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d  Hill- Rom 3 Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201cshould also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201cintrinsic \nevidence,  . . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and \nTrademark Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the  patent.\u201d  Phillips , \n415 F.3d at 1317. \u201c[T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope  narrower than it would otherwise \nbe.\u201d  Id.  \nIn some cases, courts \u201cwill need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the releva nt art during the relevant time period.\u201d  Teva , 574 U.S. at 331. \nExtrinsic evidence \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d  Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201cto ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical \naspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a par ticular meaning in the pertinent field.\u201d  \nPhillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201cexpert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer \nfrom bias tha t is not present in intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id.   Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201cmay \nbe useful to the court,\u201d it is \u201cless reliable\u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201cis unlikely 4 to result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope  unless considered in the context of the \nintrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id. at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof the patented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. \nv. Hewlett -Packa rd Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nII. THE COURT\u2019S RULING  \nThe Court\u2019s ruling regarding the disputed claim term of the \u2019376  and \u2019989 Patent s was \nannounced from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing as follows:    \nAt issue, there is one disputed claim term in two patents.  \nThese patents were previously litigated between these parties and \nresulted in a jury verdict of infringement and no invalidity of the claims asserted in that case.  During that litigation, the parties agreed that the term \u201cfluid reservoir\u201d or \u201creservoir\u201d should be given its plain and ordinary meaning.  There was no dispute or disagreement about the scope of that term.   \n In connection with this case, Plaintiff filed a motion for \njudgment on the pleadings on the grounds that collateral estoppel barred certain of Defendant\u2019s defenses.  As part of its response to that motion, Defendant\u2019s brief asserted that there was a claim construction issue that precluded my grant of the motion but did not really identify what that issue was.  During the argument on the \n12(c) motion, Defendant asserted that Plaintiff was construing \n\u201creservoir\u201d or \u201cfluid reservoir\u201d differently than it had in the prior \nlitigation.  Plaintiff disagreed.  I agreed to hear this issue in an expedited manner so that I could understand the arguments and rule on the pending motion.   \n I am now prepared to rule on the claim construction issue.  I \nwill not be issuing a  written opinion, but I will issue an order stating \nmy rulings.  I want to emphasize before I announce my decision that although I am not issuing a written opinion, we have followed a full and thorough process before making the decision I am about to state .  \nI have reviewed the patents in dispute.  I have also reviewed the \nrecord from the prior litigation, PureWick Corporation v. Sage Products, LLC , C.A. No. 19- 1508- MN, which I will call \u201c PureWick \nI\u201d.  I have read the parties\u2019 letters regarding construction and all of \nthe other references submitted in the many pages of exhibits.\n[1]  \n \n1  (D.I. 77, 80, 82, 88, 94, 95, and 105) . 5 There was full briefing on the disputed term and argument today.  \nAll of that has been carefully considered.  \n As to my ruling, I am not going to read into the record my \nunderstanding of claim construction law.  I have a legal standard \nsection that I have included in earlier opinions, including my claim \nconstruction order in PureWick I.  I incorporate that law and adopt \nit into my ruling today and will also set it out in the order that I \nissue.\n[2] \n The disputed term is \u201c fluid reservoir \u201d or \u201creservoir\u201d in \nclaims 1, 5 and 10 of the \u2019376 patent and claims 2, 3, 6 and 7 of the \u2019989 patent.\n[3]  Both parties argue that the term has its plain and \nordinary meaning.  Plaintiff proposes that meaning is \u201ca place where urine can collect.\u201d Defendant proposes that meaning is \u201ca structure that aggregates urine.\u201d  \n The dispute centers on whether there is a difference between \n\u201caggregate\u201d and \u201ccollect,\u201d whether the term requires urine to be held in the reservoir rather than be capable of being held there and whether we need to refer to the reservoir as a structure.  Here, I think that Plaintiff\u2019s statement o f the plain and ordinary meaning is the \none supported by the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence and is consistent with how the claim term was used in the prior litigation.  I will adopt that construction. \n First, I can find no meaningful difference between \n\u201caggregate\u201d and \u201ccollect\u201d in the parties\u2019 constructions.  According \nto Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary and The Chambers Dictionary, the two generally mean the same thing.\n[4]  And as I \npointed out during the hearing, without objection or disagreement, \nlooking at the online thesaurus, the two words are synonyms.[5] \n Defendant, however, argues that there is a distinction \nbetween \u201caggregate\u201d and \u201ccollect\u201d in that \u201caggregate\u201d sug gests \ncollecting and holding, while \u201ccollect\u201d does not require actually \nholding of fluid.  I do not, however, think that position is supported \n \n2  Neither party has suggested any differences in the definition of a POSA that are relevant to the claim construction issues.  \n \n3  All citations are to common matter in the \u2019376 Patent.  \n \n4  (See D.I. 105 at 5) . \n \n5  (D.I. 116 at 10:20- 24). 6 by the intrinsic evidence cited.  First, the specification states that the \n\u201creservoir 110 can be any suitable sha pe and/or size capable of \ncollecting fluid transported through the permeable support 140.\u201d[6]  \nIt then goes on to give implementations and examples where the reservoir collects and holds urine \u2013 either a large amount or a small \namount or does so temporari ly or more permanently.  It also refers \nto the reservoir forming part of a passageway and a sump.\n[7]  I do \nnot read those subsequent statements, however, to require the reservoir to hold urine \u2013 particularly given the clear statement that \nthe reservoir can be any shape or size capable of collecting fluid at the beginning of the paragraph before discussing embodiments.  I \nalso can discern no reason why holding urine would be required \ngiven that purpose of the inventions appears to be preventing urine \nleakin g from the devices, i.e., removing it rather than holding it.  I \nunderstand that the device needs to be capable of holding it when necessary but that is different from requiring it to hold fluid when not necessary.  \n Second, the prosecution read as a whole does not support \nDefendant\u2019s position.  Defendant argues that during prosecution, Plaintiff distinguished the prior art reference Kuntz from its invention to overcome the E xaminer\u2019s rejection.\n[8]  Plaintiff argued \nthat Kuntz does not have a reservoir, whi ch Plaintiff defined using \nWebster\u2019s dictionary as \u201ca cavity or part that holds some fluid secretion,\u201d because \u201cthe core material of Kuntz fills the entire internal space within Kuntz\u2019s backing layer 36, so there is no room for a reservoir within the casing between the permeable support and the casing.\u201d\n[9]  There is no further discussion of holding fluid in the \nsubsequent arguments made.  Indeed, Plaintiff concludes its \narguments, stating that \u201cwhen read in light of the specification, Applicant\u2019s term \u2018rese rvoir\u2019 should be read as a cavity or void \nspace.\n[10]  So I think that the intrinsic evidence supports Plaintiff\u2019s \nproposed construction.  And the only extrinsic evidence I have from a POSA as to the meaning agrees.  At his deposition in the prior \n \n6  (\u2019376 Patent, col. 7, ll. 38- 46). \n \n7  (\u2019376 Patent, col. 7, ll. 47- 65). \n \n8  (D.I. 94 at 3) . \n \n9  (D.I. 105 at 4) . \n \n10  (D.I. 95, Ex. 3 at 548) . \n 7 case, Def endant\u2019s expert[11] testified that he \u201cused fluid reservoir\u201d to \nmean \u201cthe same thing that anyone, any ordinary person skilled in the \nart would understand.  It\u2019s an area where fluid can collect.\u201d[12] \n Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff is shifting its \nconstruction because in PureWick I, Plaintiff argued that the Van \nDen Heuval reference did not have a \u201cfluid reservoir\u201d because urine \ndid not aggregate in the area Defendant identified as a reservoir, b ut \nis now asserting a broader construction to capture an \u201cindeterminate \u2018place\u2019\u201d in the PrimaFit 2.0.\n[13]  I am not making any determination \nabout infringement in this case, but I think that Defendant is overreading what actually happened in PureWick I.  During that \nlitigation, Plaintiff\u2019s infringement expert referred to the reservoir as \u201cthe area . . . the volume where urine can accumulate.\u201d\n[14]  As I just \nmentioned, Defendant\u2019s invalidity expert testified at his deposition that, to a POSA , a reservoir is \u201can area where fluid can collect.\u201d\n[15]  \nAt trial, though, he gave rather conclusory testimony that the prior art had a reservoir.\n[16]  In addition, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued during \nhis closing in connection with infringement that the accused product had an empty space where urine can accumulate.\n[17]  And he argued \nin connection with validity that Van D en Heuvel did not have a \n\u201cplace fo r fluid to aggregate.\u201d[18]  I think all of this testimony and \nargument from PureWick I  is consistent with the plain and ordinary \nmeaning as I understand it.[19] \n \n \n11  (D.I. 116 at 4:3 -6). \n \n12  (D.I. 105, Ex. A  at 76:24- 77:5) . \n \n13  (D.I. 94 at 5- 6). \n \n14  Plaintiff did not offer expert testimony on validity.  \n \n15  (D.I. 105, Ex. A at 77:4 -5). \n \n16  (D.I. 105, Ex. B  at 782:22- 783:12) . \n \n17  (D.I. 105, Ex. B  at 1162:3- 4). \n \n18  (D.I. 105, Ex. B at  1174:5) . \n \n19  Defendant cites to Plaintiff\u2019s expert, Mr. Jezzi\u2019s, expert report on Van Den Heuvel  in \nPureWick I to support its construction. Mr. Jezzi, however, did not testify about Van Den \nHeuvel at trial in PureWick I, and therefore his expert report is not relevant to the jury\u2019s \nunderstanding of the term or the verdict in PureWick I. 8 \nSo I am going to construe \u201creservoir\u201d and \u201cfluid reservoir\u201d \nto have the plain and ordinary meaning to a POSA, i.e., a space \nwhere fluid can collect.  I am not specifically adding the word \u201cstructure \u201d to this definition.  Plaintiff agrees the space has to be \nformed by something, some structure,\n[20] but both parties agree that \nthe reservoir is not required to be a separate structure.[21]  And thus, \nI think adding that the reservoir must be \u201ca structure\u201d may be confusing.  \n In conclusion, the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence support \nthe plain and ordinary meaning \u201creservoir\u201d or \u201cfluid reservoir\u201d as \u201ca space where urine can collect.\u201d  And t hat is how I will construe it.  \n                \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge  \n \n \n20  (D.I. 116 at 29:17- 20). \n \n21  (D.I. 116 at 7:15- 20).
