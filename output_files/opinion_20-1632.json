Andrews", "date": "07-19-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nCONSTANCE GARY,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 20-1632-RGA\n\nDELUXE CORP.,\n\nDefendant.\n\nConstance Gary, New Castle, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nAlessandra Glorioso, Esquire, Jillian Kornblatt, Esquire, and Trevor Brown, Esquire,\nDorsey & Whitney (Delaware) LLP. Counsel for Defendant\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJuly 19, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nalto (p dl Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Constance Gary appears pro se. She commenced this lawsuit on\nNovember 30, 2020. (D.I. 1). The Amended Compiaint, filed December 17, 2021,\nalleges employment discrimination under federal law and supplemental claims under\nDelaware law. (D.I. 23). Before the Court are Defendant's partial motion to dismiss and\nthe \u201cParties Joint Stipulation to Settlement Conference\u201d (D.I. 24, 27). The partial motion\nhas been fully briefed. (D.1. 25, 26, 28).\n\nlL. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff has been employed by Defendant and its predecessor company for\nmany years. (D.I. 23 at 1). She filed an employment discrimination claim with the\npredecessor company that settled prior to Defendant's acquisition of the company.\n\n(/d.). Plaintiff alleges that since settling the lawsuit with the predecessor company,\nDefendant has subjected her to a retaliatory hostile work environment, and the hostile\nwork environment continues to this day. (/d. at 3).\n\nPlaintiff raises the following claims in the Amended Complaint: retaliatory hostile\nwork environment and retaliation; defamation/defamation per se (slander); tortious\ninterference with contract/breach of contract; breach of the covenant of good faith and\nfair dealing; breach of fiduciary duty; and intentional infliction of emotional distress. (D.1.\n23 at 10-19). Defendant moves to partially dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on the\ngrounds that the First Amended Complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support all but\nher Title Vil Retaliation/Retaliatory Hostile Work Environment claim. (D.1. 25).\nDefendant moves to dismiss the claims raised under Delaware law that include a\ndefamation claim, contract claims (i.e., breach of contract, tortious interference with\n\n1\n\ncontract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing), a breach of fiduciary\nduty claim, and an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Plaintiff opposes.\n(D.1. 26).\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept\nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to\nplaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds\npro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her complaint, \u201chowever inartfully\npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by\nlawyers.\u201d /d. A court may consider the pleadings, public record, orders, exhibits\nattached to the complaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.\nTellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). A Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion maybe granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as\ntrue and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell At/. Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n\n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of\na cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014)\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). | am \u201cnot required to credit bald assertions or legal\nconclusions improperly alleged in the complaint.\u201d In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec.\n\nLitig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed, however,\n\n\u201cfor imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\u201d Johnson v.\nCity of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014).\nll. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Defamation/Defamation per se (Slander)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that a \u201cvicious rumor\u201d about her \u201cbad\u201d hygiene spread throughout\nthe workplace. (D.I. 23 at 2). The statements were made around the same time a\nformer employee of Defendant told Plaintiff about them in \u201clate 2018\u201d. (/d.). On\nunnamed dates, Plaintiff heard comments of the same nature and saw gestures relating\nto the rumor made by the \u201cVP, managers and coworkers on the production floor and at\nday-shift meetings.\u201d (/d.). Plaintiff alleges the comments were untrue and intended to\ncause her reputational harm at the workplace. (/d. at 12). She alleges that Defendant\nis vicariously liable by reason of respondeat superior. (/d. at 14).\n\nDefendant argues that the First Amended Complaint fails to plead a defamation\nclaim because it does not sufficiently identify the publisher of the alleged defamatory\nstatements. Alternatively, Defendant contends the claim is time-barred.\n\nDefamation is a tort divided into two categories: libel and slander. Libel is\n\nwritten defamation and slander is oral. In order to state a claim of\n\ndefamation properly, a plaintiff must satisfy five elements: (1) defamatory\n\ncommunication; (2) publication; (3) the communication refers to the\n\nplaintiff; (4) a third party's understanding of the communication's\n\ndefamatory character; and (5) injury. Claims of slander, (sic) generally\n\nrequire proof of special damages. However, if the defamation alleged fails\n\nwithin one of four categories, it is considered slander per se, requiring no\n\nproof of special damages. The four categories are: (1) maligning a person\n\nin his or her trade or business; (2) imputing a crime of moral turpitude; (3)\n\nimplying that the person suffers from a loathsome disease; and (4)\n\nimputing unchastity to a woman.\n\nEsposito v. Townsend, 2013 WL 493321, at *7-8 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 8, 2013)\n\n(footnotes omitted).\nAn employer can be held liable for its employee\u2019s defamation under respondeat\nsuperior. Cantrell v. Forest City Pub. Co., 419 U.S. 245, 253 (1974); see also Page v.\nOath Inc., 270 A.3d 833 (Del. 2022). While the Amended Complaint does not\nspecifically identify the person who allegedly defamed Plaintiff, it does allege that\nDefendant is responsible by reason of respondeat superior and, liberally construed,\nalleges the elements necessary to state a defamation/slander claim.\n\nDefendant also seeks dismissal on the grounds that the claim is time-barred.\nThe original complaint was filed on November 30, 2020. (D.I. 3). In Delaware, the\nstatute of limitations for defamation/slander is two years, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119. See\nDeMoss v. News-Journal Co., 408 A.2d 944, 945 (Del. 1979); Abbott v. Gordon, 2008\nWL 821522, at *23 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 27, 2008). Attached to the original complaint is\nPlaintiffs charge of discrimination wherein she states, \u201c| was continuously harassed by\nthe Vice President, supervisors and coworker with comments about my feminine\nhygiene. | have complained numerous times internally to employee relations, beginning\nDecember 20, 2018.\u201d (D.I. 1-1 at 2). The civil cover sheet speaks to Title VII claims\nand \u201cother related state claims.\u201d (D.I. 1-2). The First Amended Complaint describes the\ndefamation/slander as occurring in late 2018 (presumably by at least November 2018\nwhen Plaintiff was told about it by a former employer) and describes the slander in a\nmanner similar to that in the charge of discrimination. It is undisputed that the two-year\nstatute of limitations for defamation expired in late 2020.\n\nRule 15(c)(1)(b) allows relation back of any amendments that \u201cassert[ ] a claim or\ndefense that arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set out\u2014or attempted\nto be set out\u2014in the original pleading.\u201d It is clear that a common core of operative facts\n\n4\n\nexists between the complaint and the First Amended Complaint and, therefore, |\nconclude that the defamation/slander claim relates back to the original complaint.\nPlaintiff's defamation/ slander claims are timely and are not time-barred.\n\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will deny Defendant's motion to dismiss the\ndefamation/slander claim.\n\nB. Contract Claims: Breach of Contract; Tortious Interference with a\nContract; Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\nOn March 24, 2020, a meeting was held and employees were advised of\nDefendant's COVID 19 leave policy. (D.I. 23 at 14). Employees were informed they\ncould take unpaid leave for childcare related reasons. (/d.). Plaintiff alleges that she\nand Defendant had a COVID-19 unpaid leave contract by reason of email\ncorrespondence between Plaintiff and her manager, and that the terms and conditions\nof Plaintiff's leave were made clear when Plaintiff was informed she would be piaced on\nunpaid leave until schools reopened. (/d.). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant tortiously\ninterfered with and/or breached the contract when it threatened Plaintiff with termination\nof employment if she did not accept new contract terms and forced Plaintiff to use\nunaccrued time to pay for the leave, caused Plaintiff not to accrue time, treated Plaintiff\nas a furloughed employee with no guarantee of a return to assignment as opposed to\nan employee on leave, forced Plaintiff to return to work before school officially\nreopened, failed to acknowledge the existence of Plaintiffs contract with her manager,\nand unilaterally used unaccrued time to pay Plaintiff via mail (as opposed to direct\ndeposit). (/d. at 4, 15).\n\nPlaintiff alleges that when she entered the unpaid leave contract, there was an\n\noffer of unpaid leave for childcare related needs, she accepted, and the length of the\n5\n\ncontract term was until schools reopened. (/d. at 15). Plaintiff alleges that that there\nwas no mention of time not accruing or a requirement to use unaccrued time until it ran\nout, when Plaintiff would then be expected to return to work. (/d).\n\nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that \u201cbecause a contract existed between [Plaintiff] and\nher manager and [Defendant] tortiously interfered with and breached its manager\u2019s\ncontract with her, [Defendant] is liable for breach of [the] covenant\u201d of good faith and fair\ndealing. (D.1. 23 at 16). Plaintiff alleges that it was through Defendant's deceit and\nmisrepresentation that she entered into the unpaid leave contract with her manager.\nShe relied upon Defendant/Defendant representative\u2019s deceitful misrepresentations to\nremain in her position and retain job stability through the pandemic. She accepted the\noffer to go on unpaid leave of absence in relation to her childcare needs. (/d.).\n\nDefendant moves for dismissal of the contract claims on the grounds that they\nare not adequately pled as they fail to plead the existence of a contract, a party cannot\ntortiously interfere with its own contract and the only contract alleged is between Plaintiff\nand Defendant, and the First Amended Complaint fails to adequately plead breach of\nthe covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nThe plaintiff in a contract action must prove by a preponderance of the evidence\nthe existence of an offer of a contract by one party; an acceptance of that offer by the\nother party; consideration for the offer and acceptance; and sufficiently specific terms\nthat determine the obligation of each party. See Fanean v. Rite Aid Corp., 984 A.2d\n812, 822 (Del. Super. Ct. 2009). To state a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must\n\nestablish that a contract existed; the defendant breached an obligation imposed by the\n\ncontract; and that the breach damaged the plaintiff. VLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett-\nPackard Co., 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del. 2003).\n\nTo state a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, \u201c[t]here must\nbe (1) a contract, (2) about which defendant knew and (3) an intentional act that is a\nsignificant factor in causing the breach of such contract (4) without justification (5) which\ncauses injury.\u201d Irwin & Leighton, Inc. v. W.M. Anderson Co., 532 A.2d 983, 992 (Del.\nCh. 1987) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 (1979)).\n\n\u201cTo state a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\n[a plaintiff] must allege (1) a specific implied contractual obligation; (2) a breach of the\nobligation by the defendant; and (3) resulting damage to the plaintiff.\u201d O\u2019Neill v. AFS\nHoldings, LLC, 2014 WL 626031, at *4 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 15, 2014) (quoting\nFitzgerald v. Cantor, 1998 WL 842316, at * 1 (Del. Ch. Nov. 10, 1998)). The implied\ncovenant has a \u201cnarrow purpose\u201d and is \u201conly rarely invoked successfully.\u201d O\u2019Neill,\n2014 WL 626031, at *4.\n\nThe First Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff entered into an unpaid leave\ncontract when she accepted an offer of unpaid leave for childcare related needs, the\ncontract ending when schools reopened. The First Amended Complaint alleges the\nexistence of a contract in a conclusory manner. It recites some elements of a contract \u2014\noffer, acceptance, vague terms \u2014 but not consideration. It alleges that the contract is\nbased upon an email Plaintiff received from her manager, yet the First Amended\nComplaint indicates that the email is based upon the COVID-19 leave policy discussed\nwith employees during a March 24, 2020 meeting. The allegations indicate that the\nCOVID-19 leave policy was a unilateral expression of Defendant\u2019s policy to provide\n\n7\nguidance to its employees and, as such, does not establish contract rights. See, e.g.,\nHeideck v. Kent General Hosp., Inc., 446 A.2d 1095, 1097 (Del. 1982) (employer\u2019s\ninformational booklet was a unilateral expression of employer\u2019s policies and procedures\nissued for guidance and benefits of employees); Torres v. Sussex County Council, 2014\nWL 7149179, at *8 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 8, 2014) (an employer\u2019s internal guidelines are\na mere unilateral expression of an employer's policies and do not establish contract\nrights.).\n\nThe First Amended Complaint fails to allege the existence of a contract, which is\nan essential element to all the contract claims raised by Plaintiff. Therefore,\nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the contract claims will be granted.\n\nCc. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n\nPlaintiff alleges that employers have a statutory duty to protect employees from\nretaliatory hostile work environment and retaliation and a common law duty of care for\nthe wellbeing, health, and safety of their employees. (D.I. 23 at 16). Plaintiff alleges\nthat Defendant is liable for breaching its duty to protect her from its corporate managers,\nsite managers, and employees who engaged in conduct with the intent to cause her\nharm. (/d. at 18). Defendant moves for dismissal on the grounds that employers do not\nhave a fiduciary duty to employees under Delaware common law.\n\nUnder Delaware law, \u201c[a] claim for breach of fiduciary duty requires proof of two\nelements: (1) that a fiduciary duty existed and (2) that the defendant breached that\nduty.\u201d Beard Research, Inc. v. Kates, 8 A.3d 573, 601 (Del. Ch. 2010). In deciding\nwhether a fiduciary relationship exists, the Court may consider factors including\nwhether: \u201c(1) a party places trust in the faithful integrity of another who thus gains\n\n8\n\nsuperiority or influence; (2) one party assumes control and responsibility over another;\n(3) one party has a duty to act or give advice for matters within the relationship; and (4)\nthere is a traditionally recognized fiduciary relationship. Cunningham v. Kentmere\nRehab. & Healthcare Ctr., Inc., 2021 WL 1157991, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 25, 2021)\n(internal citations omitted). An employee-employer relationship does not, standing\nalone, give rise to fiduciary duties. See Wayman Fire Protection, Inc. v. Premium Fire &\nSecurity, LLC, 2014 WL 897223 at *20 (Del. Ch. Mar. 5, 2014). Moreover, while the\nallegations support Plaintiff's Title VII claims, they do not plausibly allege the existence\nof a fiduciary duty sufficient to state a claim. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss\nthe breach of fiduciary duty claim will be granted.\n\nDz Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n\nFinally, Plaintiff alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress. She claims\nthat Defendant is liable for her severe emotional and physical distress which\nDefendant's HR and ER representatives intended to cause by failing to investigate her\ncomplaints, telling Plaintiff she would have to deal with the conduct, and that the\nconduct was appropriate and acceptable to it. (/d. at 18-19). Defendant moves for\ndismissal of the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim on the grounds that the\nFirst Amended Complaint fails to plead a claim.\n\nDelaware applies Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 in defining the elements of\nintentional infliction of emotional distress. See Cummings v. Pinder, 574 A.2d 843, 845\n(Del.1990) (per curiam). That section imposes liability, in relevant part, on \u201cOne who by\n\nextreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional\ndistress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to\nthe other results from it, for such bodily harm.\u201d\n\nThe claim for infliction of emotional distress is not supported by sufficient factual\nallegations. The facts do not suggest Defendant's conduct was extreme or outrageous,\nor that Plaintiff suffered emotional distress so severe as to give rise to an actionable\nclaim. See Subh v. Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, 2009 WL 866798, at *19-20 (D. Del. Mar.\n31, 2009) (finding no extreme and outrageous conduct where the employee-plaintiff\nremained employed by the defendant-employer for several months of allegedly severe\ndiscrimination), report & rec. adopted, 2009 WL 3153511, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2009),\naff'd, 386 F. App\u2019x 29 (3d Cir. 2010). To the extent that Plaintiff's intentional infliction of\nemotional distress claim relies on the same operative facts used to support her other\nclaims, the claim must fail as a matter of law. Talley v. Christiana Care Health Sys.,\n2018 WL 5045363, at *4 (D. Del. Oct. 17, 2018) (finding that plaintiff's intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress claim fails where it \u201csounds a lot like Plaintiff re-casting\nher breach of contract claim as a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d);\nBarker v. Huang, 610 A.2d 1341, 1351 (Del. 1992) (\u2018[A]n independent action for\nintentional infliction of emotional distress does not lie where [] the gravamen of the\ncomplaint sounds in defamation.\u201d). Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress\nclaim rests largely on the factual bases for her other claims and, therefore, the Court will\n\ngrant Defendant's motion to dismiss this claim.\n\n10\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court wiil: (1) grant in part and deny in part\nDefendant\u2019s partial motion to dismiss (D.1. 24); and (2) dismiss all contract, breach of\nfiduciary, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. Amendment of the\ndismissed claims would be futile. Plaintiff has already amended her complaint once,\nand the dismissed claims are not viable theories of liability for the set of factual\ncircumstances that Plaintiff alleges.\n\nThe Court notes the request for mediation is a request that | mediate the case.\n(D.I. 27). lam going to deny that request without prejudice to renew after Defendant\nanswers the Amended Complaint. If the parties truly want a successful mediation, |\ntend to think a request for a referral to a magistrate judge for the purpose of ADR would\nmake more sense.\n\nA separate order shall issue.\n\n11\n"}
