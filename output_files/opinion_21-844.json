(D.I. 4)   Defendants Glaxo Group Limited and Human \nGenome Sciences, Inc. (\u201cDefendants\u201d or \u201cGSK\u201d) oppose the Motion.  For the reasons set forth  \nbelow, the Court recommends th at DRIT\u2019s  Motion be  GRANTED with regard to the request for \nremand, and orders that the reques t for fees and costs be DENIED .1  \nI. BACKGROUND  A. Factual Background  \nThis case arose out of a dispute between non- party Biogen Idec MA Inc. (\u201cBiogen\u201d) and  \nGSK regarding which of them was entitled to patent rights covering a lupus treatment that was \neventually  commercialized as GSK\u2019s drug Benlysta\u00ae.  (D.I. 1, ex. 5, ex. A  (hereinafter, \u201cAm. \n \n1  A motion to remand is considered a dispositive motion; for that reason, the Court \nis titling this opinion as a Report and Recommendation.  In re U.S. Healthcare , 159 F.3d 142, \n146 (3d Cir. 1998); Hutchins v. Bayer Corp., C.A. No. 08- 640-JJF-LPS, 2009 WL 192468, at *3 \n(D. Del. Jan. 23, 2009).    2 \n Compl.\u201d) at \u00b6\u00b6 1- 3)  In light of this dispute, the United States Patent and Trademark Office \n(\u201cPTO\u201d) had declared an interference, which is a procedure used to determine which of two \ninventors who are seeking patents covering the same invention is in fact the rightful inventor .  \n(Id. at \u00b6 2)  In 2008, Biogen and GSK settled their dispute pursuant to a Patent License and \nSettlement Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) .  (Id. at \u00b6 1)  Through this Agreement, Biogen gave up \nits pa tent rights in exchange for milestone payments and ongoing r oyalties from sales of \nBenl ysta; Biogen\u2019s right to such payments would last  through the expiration of \u201cthe last Valid \nClaim\u201d of certain patents covering products like Benlysta , including United States Patent No. \n8,071,092 (the \u201c'092 patent\u201d) , which issued on December 6, 2011.  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6  6, 8- 9, 21, 32)   In \n2012, DRIT obtained an assignment of Biogen\u2019s royalty rights under the Agreement.  ( Id. at \u00b6 \n46)   \n On April 27, 2015, GSK voluntarily filed a form with the PTO to statutorily disclaim the \n'092 patent.  ( Id. at \u00b6 50)  A statutory disclaimer is a statement filed by a patent owner with the \nPTO by which the patent owner relinquishes its legal rights to some or all of a patent\u2019s claims.  (Id. at \u00b6 51) ; see also 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 253.  There is a required f ee for a statutory disclaimer.  ( Am. \nCompl. at \u00b6 52) ; see also 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 253.  After filing the statutory disclaimer, GSK stopped \npaying royalties to DRIT on sales of Benlysta in the United States , effective April 27, 2015; \nGSK\u2019s contention was that, pur suant to the terms of the Agreement, once it disclaimed the '092 \npatent, there was no long er any \u201cValid Claim\u201d covering the product in the United States  (and \nthus it no longer owed DRIT any royalty payments) .  (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 \u00b6 56,  59)   \nIn July 2016, DRIT filed a complaint against GSK  in the Delaware Superior Court   \nasserting  a claim for breach of contract ( \u201cCount I \u201d) and a claim for breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing ( \u201cCount II \u201d) under Delaware state law ; the complaint was 3 \n premised upon GSK\u2019s failure to pay royalties on sales of Benlysta after April 27, 2015, in light \nof GSK\u2019s  statutory disclaimer of the '092 patent.  ( D.I. 1 , ex. 1 at  ex. 3 at \u00b6\u00b6  61-75)  Thereafter, \nGSK moved to dismiss both claims.  ( Id., ex. 1, ex. 4 at 1)  The Delaware Superior Court \ndismissed Count I , on the ground that a \u201cValid Claim\u201d is defined in the Agreement as one that \nhas not been disclaimed, and here, the '092 patent had in fact been disclaimed  by GSK.  ( Id. at \n11-18)  However, the Court  denied GSK\u2019s motion to dismiss as to Count II .  (Id. at 18 -20)   \n During discovery with respect to Count II, DRIT learned that the required fee for GSK\u2019s \nstatutory disclaimer was not actually paid on April 27, 2015; instead, it was not paid until  July \n16, 2015.  (Am. Compl. at \u00b6  50; id., ex. C)  W hen GSK f iled the statutory disclaimer form on \nApril 27, 2015, it had authorized the PTO to deduct any required fees from a deposit account.  (D.I. 6, ex. 1)   But on July 16, 2015, GSK noticed that the PTO ha d not in fact removed the \nrequired $160 fee from its deposit account ; GSK then simply affirmatively paid the fee.  (D.I. 1, \nex. 6 at 4)   \n On April 10, 2018, DRIT filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint (the \n\u201cmotion to amend\u201d) to add a second  breach of contract claim ( \u201cCount III \u201d); Count III sought \nroyalty payments for the period between April 27, 2015 ( when the statutory disclaimer form was \nfiled) and July 16, 2015 ( when the required fee was affirmatively paid by GSK ).  (Id., ex. 5)  On \nApril 25, 2018, the Delaware Superior Court granted DRIT\u2019s motion to amend  and deemed the \namended complaint filed and served.  (D.I. 6, ex. 4)    \nGSK subsequently moved for summary judgment with respect to Count II, and it moved \nto dismiss Coun t III.  (Id., ex. 3; D.I. 1, ex. 6 at 1- 2; D.I. 1, ex. 10 at ECF Page No. 448)   \nMeanwhile, DRIT moved for partial summary judgment with respect to Count III.  ( See D.I. 1, \nex. 10 at ECF Page No. 408, 468)  The motions were argued before the Delaware Superi or Court 4 \n on June 18, 2018, ( see D.I. 1, ex. 10 at ECF Page No. 551- 52, 555), and on August 17, 2018, t he \nDelaware Super ior Court  issued an opinion on the  motions , (id., ex. 7) .  With respect to Count II, \nthe Delaware Superior Court denied GSK\u2019s motion for summary judgment .  (Id. at 10 -21)  And \nwith respect to Count III, the Delaware Superior Court converted GSK\u2019s motion to dismiss th e \nCount in to a motion for summary judgment , and then severed Count III from the rest of the case, \nwith resolution of Count III  to proceed after trial on Count II  (if necessary ).  (Id. at 21, 30)   \n In September 2018, the parties tried Count II before a jury, wh ich ultimately r eturned a \nverdict for DRIT.  (D .I. 6, ex. 5)  On October 17, 2019, t he Delaware Superior Court denied \nGSK\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on Count II.  ( Id., ex. 6 at 3- 8)  The parties \nappealed/ cross -appealed with respect to Counts I and II.  (D.I. 1, ex. 8 at 3, 10- 12)  On March 3, \n2021, the Supreme Court of Delaware issued a decision that affirmed the Delaware Superior \nCourt\u2019s ruling for GSK with respect to Count I and reversed the judgment for DRIT with respect to Count II.  ( Id. at 3)   \n On March 31, 2021, DRIT requested that the Delaware Superior Court decide the merits \nas to Count III.  ( Id., ex. 10 at ECF page no. 550 -52)  GSK thereafter moved for entry of a \nrevised final judgment in GSK\u2019s favor with respect to Counts I and II, which was granted on June 4, 2021.  ( Id. at ECF page no. 670 -71)   \nB. Procedural History  \n On June 10, 2021, GSK filed a Notice of Removal of Count III (the \u201cNotice of \nRemoval\u201d) with this Court.  (D.I. 1 )  On June 24, 2021, DRIT filed the instant Motion , (D.I. 4) , \nwhich was fully briefed as of July 22, 2021, (D.I. 9).\n  On November 9, 2021, United States \nDistrict Judge Leonard P. Stark referred this case to the Court to resolve all pre -trial matters up \nto and including expert discovery matte rs, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b).  (D.I. 16)    5 \n II. LEGAL STANDARD  \n Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, a defendant may remove \u201cany civil action brought in a \nState court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdic tion[.]\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) .  A district court has original jurisdiction over a civil action \u201carising under the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, as well a ny civil action \n\u201carising under any Act of Congress relating to pate nts, plant variety protection, copyrights and \ntrademarks [,]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a ).  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1454 (\u201cSection 1454\u201d) , any party is \nauthorized to remove the latter group of such claims to federal court.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1454.      \n As explained  by the  Supreme  Court  of the United  States  in Gunn v.  Minton, 568 U.S.  251 \n(2013), a  case can  \u201caris[e] under\u201d  federal  law in two ways.   First  and most  directly , \u201ca case arises  \nunder  federal  law when  federal  law creates  the cause of  action  asserted. \u201d  Gunn v.  Minton, 568 \nU.S. 251, 257 (2013).2  Second, if  a plaintiff  brings  a state  law claim  that necessarily  raises  a \nfederal  issue , the claim may also \u201caris[e]  under\u201d  federal  law, such  that the district court  will have  \noriginal  jurisdiction  over  the state  law claim , so long as  four  factors  (the \u201cGunn factors\u201d)  are \nmet:  \u201cif  [the]  federal  issue  is:  (1) necessarily  raised,  (2) actually  disputed, (3) substantial,  and \n(4) capable of  resolution in  federal  court  without  disrupting the  federal -state balance approved by \nCongress [.]\u201d  Id. at 258;  see also Sanyo Elec.  Co.,  Ltd. v.  Intel  Corp., C.A.  No. 18-1709- RGA,  \n2019 WL  1650067, at  *4 (D. Del.  Apr.  17, 2019) .  This second  type  of federal  \u201carising  under\u201d  \njurisdiction  \u201ccaptures  the commonsense  notion that  a federal  court  ought  to be able to  hear  \nclaims  recognized  under  state law that nonetheless  turn on substantial  questions  of federal  law,  \nand thus  justify  resort  to the experience,  solicitude,  and hope  of uniformity  that a federal  forum  \n \n2  A patent infringement lawsuit, for example, would arise under federal law in this \nway because such a suit is authoriz ed by federal statute (i.e., 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 271, 281) .  Gunn, 568 \nU.S. at 257.   6 \n offers  on federal  issues[.]\u201d   Grable  & Sons  Metal  Prods., Inc.  v. Darue  Eng\u2019g  & Mfg. , 545 U.S.  \n308, 312 (2005).  However,  only a  \u201cspecial  and small category\u201d of  cases  will meet  all four  of the \nGunn factors .  Gunn, 568  U.S.  at 258 (internal  quotation marks  and citation  omitted) ; Sanyo \nElec. , 2019 WL  1650067, at  *4 (\u201c[J]urisdiction  pursuant  to [the Gunn factors ] is rare.\u201d).   The  \n\u201cmere presence of  a federal  issue  in a state  cause of action  does  not automatically  confer \u201d federal  \njurisdiction.   Merrell  Dow  Pharm. Inc.  v. Thompson, 478 U.S.  804, 813 (1986);  see also Sanyo \nElec. , 2019 WL  1650067, at  *4.   \n Upon removal of an action to federal court, a plaintiff may challenge such removal by \nmoving to remand the case back to state court.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) .  The party that removed the \naction bears the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction.  Steel Valley Auth. v. Union Switch & \nSignal Div., 809 F.2d 1006, 1010 (3d Cir. 1987) ; Sanyo Elec. , 2019 WL  1650067, at  *4. \nRemoval  statutes  are to  be strictly  construed, with  all doubts  to be resolved  in favor  of remand.   \nManning v.  Merrill  Lynch  Pierce Fenner  & Smith, Inc. , 772 F.3d 158, 162 (3d Cir. 2014);  Sanyo \nElec. , 2019 WL  1650067, at  *4.   \nIn addition to arriving at federal court with a claim that arises under federal law, a \nremoving party must also be on time.  See, e.g., Univ. of Ky. Rsch. Found., Inc. v. Niadyne, Inc., \nCivil No. 13- 16-GFVT, 2013 WL 5943921, at *7 (E.D. Ky. Nov. 5, 2013).  Typ ically, a \ndefendant must file a notice of removal within 30 days after the receipt of the initial pleading, or \nwithin 30 days after receipt of \u201c an amended pleading, motion, order or other paper from which it \nmay first be ascertained that the case is one wh ich is or has become removable .\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1446(b) (2)(B), (C)(3) (\u201cSection 1446(b)\u201d) .  Section 1454 allows for the 30- day deadline in \nSection 1446(b) to be extended \u201cat any time for cause shown.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1454(b)(2).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  7 \n  GSK\u2019s Notice of Removal asserts that because resolving Count III  itself requires deciding \na substantial issue of federal patent law \u2014i.e., when a statutory disclaimer of a patent becomes \neffective3\u2014this Court has exclusive jurisdiction over Count III.  ( D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6  9-10, 12; see also \nD.I. 8 at 4- 10)  Now with its Motion, DRIT  argues  that this case should be remanded to the \nDelaware Superior Court because:  (1) GSK\u2019s notice of removal is untimely ; and (2) the patent \nissue implicated by DRIT\u2019s state law claim in Count III does not arise under federal law ( such \nthat consequently, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction).  (D.I. 5)  For the reasons \ndiscussed below, the Court agrees with DRIT that the case  should be remanded because , at a \nminimum,  GSK failed to timely file its Notice of Removal.   \n It is undisputed that the 30 -day clock for removal of this case began running on April 25, \n2018\u2014the date the Delaware Superior Court deemed DRIT\u2019s  amended complaint asserting \nCount III filed and served.  ( Id. at 10; D. I. 8 at 10- 14; D.I. 9 at 1) ; see also Cont\u2019l Warranty, Inc. \nv. Warner , Civ. No. 13- 1187- SLR, 2014 WL 2754931, at *1 (D. Del. June 17, 2014)  (\u201cThe 30 -\nday removal period begins when the defendant is formally served.\u201d).  Thus, GSK would have \nhad to remove the case by May 25, 2018 to be within the 30- day window.  GSK did not do so; \ninstead, GSK filed its Notice of Removal over three years later, on June 10, 2021.  (D.I. 1; see also D.I. 8 at 12; D.I. 9 at 2)    Although it remov ed this case well outside of the 30- day deadline, GSK asserts that its \nremoval was  not untimely because it has shown cause to extend the 30 -day deadline , pursuant to \nSection 1454.  (D.I. 8 at 1, 10- 14)  To tha t end, GSK argues that  had it removed right after \n \n3  More specifically, as GSK explains  it, the dispute over Count III goes to  whether \nGSK owes DRIT royalties on the '092 patent f rom April 27, 2015 through July 16, 2015; thus, it \nturns on \u201cthe question of whether a patent disclaimer is effective upon filing if the filing \nauthorizes the PTO to collect the appropriate fee from the filer\u2019s deposit account [,] or if the \ndisclaimer is not e ffective until the fee is actually credited by the PTO.\u201d  (D.I. 8 at 3)  8 \n DRIT\u2019s motion to amend was granted, this  would have wasted many years\u2019 worth of resources \nthat the parties had already spent litigating the case in Delaware Superior Court , and would have \ndelayed the time i t took for GSK \u201cto vindicate itself as to Counts I and II.\u201d   (Id. at 1, 13)   \nFurthermore, as an additional  reason supporting its delayed removal of this case, GSK notes  that \nCount III was severed from the case in August 2018 and rem ained inactive for much of the entire \nperiod of delay.  ( Id.)     \nIn order to have the removal deadline extended \u201cfor cause shown\u201d under Section 1454, \nthe removing party bears the burden of establishing \u201csome reason for why the untimely removal \nshould be excused.\u201d  Sovereign Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Minturn, Case No. 4:20- cv-00298- SRB, 2020 WL \n3124315, at *3 (W.D. M o. June 12, 2020) (citing cases).  Section 1454 does not define \u201ccause \nshown.\u201d   But  federal courts  have looked for guidance to  authorities that interpret the \u201cgood \ncause\u201d standard set out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) (\u201cRule 6(b)\u201d) for extending \ndeadlines in litigation generally.   Recif Res., LLC v. Juniper Cap. Advisors, L.P., Civil Acti on \nNo. H -19-2953, 2019 WL 5457705, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Oct. 24, 2019); NematicITO, Inc. v. \nSpectrum Five LLC , Case No. 16- cv-01859- RS, 2016 WL 3167181, at *4 (N.D. Cal. June 6, \n2016) .  The good cause standard is not a r igorous one, but it requires a reasonable explanation \nfor the party\u2019s delay.  NematicITO, Inc., 2016 WL 3167181, at *4; Andrews v. Daughtry , 994 F. \nSupp. 2d 728, 735 (M.D.N.C. 2014).4  Courts have analyzed whether good cause has been shown \n \n4  GSK points out that Congress enacted Section 1454 to \u201cmake removal of patent \nand copyright claims easier.\u201d  (D.I. 8 at 10- 11 (quoting Donahue v. Tokyo Electron Am., Inc., \nCase No. A -14-CA-563-SS, 2014 WL 12479285, at *7 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2014))  Indeed, \nSection 1454 was created in 2011 as part of the Leahy- Smith America Invents Act, and it \neffectively abrogated the Supreme Court \u2019s decision in  Holmes Grp., Inc. v. Vornado Air \nCircul ation Sys., Inc., 535 U.S. 826 (2002) .  See Niadyne , 2013 WL 5943921, at *5.  The \nHolmes Grp.  Court had ruled that a defendant\u2019s counterclaim asserting non- infringement could \nnot serve as the basis for a district court\u2019s \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction , because it was a plaintiff\u2019s \nwell-pleaded complaint (and not a defendant\u2019s counterclaim) that dictated whether a case \u201carises 9 \n under Rule 6(b) (and, consequently, Section 1454) utilizing four factors:  (1) the potential for \nprejudice to other parties; (2) the length of the delay and its impact on the case; (3) the reason for the delay and whether it was in the removing party\u2019s control; and (4) whether the removing party \nhas acted in good faith.  Recif Res. , 2019 WL 5457705, at *2; Hill Country Trust v. Silverberg, \n1:18- CV-635-RP, 2018 WL 6267880, at *8 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 28, 2018) ; see also (D.I. 5 at 11; \nD.I. 8 at 11; D.I. 9 at 2).  Applying these factors to the facts at hand, the Court finds that GSK \nhas not shown cause for its extension of the removal deadline.  \nWith regard to the first factor \u2014the potential for prejudice to other parties \u2014DRIT has \nsurely suffered some prejudice due to GSK\u2019s delay in removing this case .  (D.I. 5 at 11- 12; D.I. 9 \nat 2)  Instead of timely removing the case following its receipt of DRIT\u2019s amended compl aint \nasserting Count III, GSK chose instead to keep litigating that claim in state court.  A ccordingly, \nDRIT filed a motion for partial summary judgment on Count III (which the parties briefed to \ncompletion ), while GSK moved to dismiss Count III  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction a nd \non the merits.   (D.I. 5 at 11- 12; see also D.I. 1, ex. 6 at 7)  The parties then argued these motions \nbefore the Delaware Superior Court.  (D.I. 5 at 12)  Although GSK attempts to characterize any resulting  prejudice to DRIT as \u201cminimal[,]\u201d (D.I. 8 at 11), courts have found prejudice to exist  in \nsimilar circumstances , see, e.g., NematicITO, Inc. , 2016 WL 3167181, at *4 (finding prejudice \n \nunder\u201d federal law for removal purposes .  535 U.S. at 829- 34.  Thus, by enacting Section 1454, \nCongress \u201cbroadened f ederal court removal jurisdiction to better ensure that whenever claims \narise under federal patent law, they are removable, irrespective of who asserted them.\u201d  See \nNiadyne , 2013 WL 5943921, at *5.  Nevertheless, courts evaluating motions to remand have \nstressed that the timing provisions of Sections 1446 and 1454 are  important and must be \nfollowed, even if a claim arises under federal patent law ; these courts reason that if Congress \nbelieved otherwise, it would have simply removed all time limitations in e nacting Section 1454.  \nSee, e.g., A ccutrax, LLC v. Kildevaeld , 140 F. Supp. 3d 168, 173 (D. Mass. 2015); Andrews , 994 \nF. Supp. 2d at 735- 36; Niadyne , 2013 WL 5943921, at *10- 11; SnoWizard, Inc. v. Andrews , \nCivil Action No. 12- 2796, 2013 WL 3728410, at *5 (E.D. La. July 12, 2013) .    10 \n where the defendant filed a notice of removal mere days before its deadline to respond to the \nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary adjudication, as plaintiffs \u201chave expended considerable time, effort, and resources during this litigation and to prepare its motion for summary adjudication\u201d).  GSK made DRIT jump through a number of econom ic and logistical hoops  to contest Count III \nin the Superior Court \u2014requiring DRIT to perform a  costly four -month \u201ctest run\u201d of its merits \narguments \u2014only to then ask DRIT to do the same thing again three years later in federal court.  \nThere is some prejudice there.    \nAs for the second factor \u2014length of the delay and its impact on the case\u2014 GSK posits that \nthe three- year delay really had  \u201cno impact\u201d on the proceedings ; indeed, GSK argues that  the \ndelay  allowed for the possibility of conserv ing party and judicial resources .  (D.I. 8 at 12)  GSK \nsuggests this is so be cause Count III could have ended up moot if the Delaware Supreme Court \nhad upheld the jury \u2019s verdict for DRIT on Count II .  (Id.)  But a s an initial mater, the Court \nagrees with DRIT that GSK\u2019s framing of this issue is a bit misleading .  (D.I. 9 at 2)   When GSK \ndecided not to remove the case by th e 30-day stat utory deadline in May  2018, it was not looking \nto conserve anyone\u2019s resources.  After all, the Delaware Superior Court did not sever Count III  \nuntil August 2018, and when it did so, it acted sua sponte \u2014not because GSK had suggested it \ntake that path.  So GSK\u2019s delay  in removing Count III \u2014at least in the period between April  2018 \nand August 2018\u2014did have an impact.  Not only did it waste DRIT\u2019s r esources , but it also \nencumbered the  resources of the  Delaware Superior Court .  That Court had to consider the \nparties \u2019 briefs  regarding Count III, hear oral argument, and issue an opinion setting o ut the \nrelevant facts and legal issues ( in which it d eterm ined that Count III would be severed pending \nthe trial on Count II ).  (Id. at 2-3; see also D.I. 5 at 12)   None of this work would have had to \noccur in state court had GSK timely removed .  Courts have repeatedly and consistently found 11 \n that when the removing party first actively engaged in state court litigation , and then belatedly \nremov ed a claim, the resulting drain on state court resources militates in favor of a finding of no \ncause shown under Section 1454.  See, e.g., Finjan, Inc. v. Trustwave Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. \n20-372-LPS, (D.I. 42 at 5), (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2021) (hereinafter, \u201cFinjan\u201d) (finding that the \nremoving party\u2019s 18- month del ay in removing the case  was \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cif effective, could \nadversely affect both the state court (by wasting the extensive efforts it has expended in handling the parties\u2019 dispute) and this Court (which might have to replough ground already covered by Judge Carpenter)\u201d) ; Hill Country Trust , 2018 WL 6267880, at *9 (finding that this factor \nweighed against extending the removal deadline under Section 1454, where in the two months between the expiration of the 30- day removal deadline and the defendant\u2019s re moval, the \ndefendant \u201cwas an active participant in state court litigation\u201d) ; XIP LLC v. Commtech Sales LLC , \nNO. 4:15- CV-664-A, 2015 WL 6724933, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 3, 2015) ( finding no cause \nshown to extend the removal deadline under Section 1454, where the removing defendants had \nfirst \u201ctried unsuccessfully to gain a favorable outcome in the state court through the summary judgment process\u201d); Andrews , 994 F. Supp. 2d at 735 ( finding no cause for  a three -month delay \nunder Section 1454, where during the intervening time, the removing defendant \u201c actively \nengaged the state court in the litigation process \u201d by petitioning the state court to transfer the case \nand filing a motion to dismiss) ; Niadyne , 2013 WL 5943921, at *10 (\u201cAs an initial matter, \nallowing a case to be litigated for an extensive period of time in state court only to permit removal very late in the day unnecessarily transgresses the important notions of conservation of resources an d judicial economy.\u201d) .   \n With regard to the third factor \u2014the reason for GSK\u2019s delay and whether it was in GSK\u2019s \ncontrol \u2014GSK first turns the tables and faults DRIT ; it argues that DRIT added Count III late in 12 \n the state court case, at a point when removal woul d have wasted multiple years of prior litigation \nin that Court .  (D.I. 8 at 12- 13)  But DRIT reasonably counters  that:  (1) it only became aware of \nthe facts underlying Count III during discovery, including by taking depositions of GSK\u2019s \nwitnesses ; and (2)  the Delaware Superior Court ultimately found its mo tion to amend to add \nCount III  to be  well -founded, even though th at motion w as filed at a  later stage of the l itigation .  \n(D.I. 5 at 6; D.I. 9 at 3)  So the Court does not see why DRIT\u2019s timeline for amending should \nhave anything to do with how this factor comes out.  GSK next argues that any delay was \njustified because of the years spent litigating the other claims in the case .  (D.I. 8 at 13)   The  \nCourt understand s that position , as at the time the s tatutory window for removal was closi ng on \nCount III, the other claims  (including the still- live Count II) had been litigat ed in state court for \nquite a while.   But  as DRIT retorts , had GSK sought removal of the entire case back in mid -\n2018, either party could have sought remand of Count II back to the Delaware Superior Court \npursuant to Section 1454(d)(2) .  (D.I. 9 at 3)  Finally, GSK\u2019s suggestion that it delayed removal \nbecau se of the Delaware Superior Court\u2019s severance of Count III , (D.I. 8 at 13), again ignores \nthat the C ount was severed many months after GSK\u2019s 30 -day removal deadline had expired, \n(D.I. 9 at 4).5  In the end, t he delay here was in GSK\u2019s control, and there w as not a  sufficiently  \ngood reason for it. \n As for the fourth factor \u2014whether GSK has acted in good faith\u2014DRIT contends that \nGSK remov ed this case \u201conly after testing the waters with the Superior Court [,]\u201d and that this  \n \n5  At one point in its answering brief, GSK suggests  (without citation)  that the Court \nshould excuse its delay in removing this case because the Delaware Superior Court has \u201calready \nbalked at resolving a novel issue of patent l aw that should be decided by this Court.\u201d  (D.I. 8 at \n1)  But that kind of language is not fair to the Delaware Superior Court .  That Court in fact \nindicated that  it would be  well -prepared to rule on this  issue , depending on the outcome of \nGSK\u2019s anticipate d attempt at removal.  (D.I. 9 at 1; see also D.I. 1, ex. 10 at ECF Page No. 659 -\n61)  This is therefore not a valid reason to ignore GSK\u2019s belated removal.   13 \n demonstrates bad faith conduct.  (D.I. 5 at 13 -14 (citing Sovereign Int\u2019l, Inc., 2020 WL 3124315, \nat *3 ( \u201c[T]he timing provisions of \u00a7 1446 and \u00a7 1454 are important because  they limit the ability \nof the Defendant to test the waters in one forum and, finding them inhospitable, move to another \nforum that might be more sympathetic to its views.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted) ); see also  D.I. 9 at 4 -5)  In othe r words, DRIT is suggesting that GSK:  (1) observed the \nDelaware Superior Court\u2019s comments and views about Count III (as well as its comments/views \nabout GSK\u2019s case more generally)  over the last few years ; (2) from that, likely thought that the \nDelaware Su perior Court would rule against it on the merits to Count III; and thus (3) in bad \nfaith, decided to remove Count III to this Court , to try to get a more favorable decision than what \nwas surely coming in the state forum.  (D.I. 5 at 13 ; D.I. 9 at 4- 5 (citing D.I. 6, ex. 6 at 12 n.33) )  \nThat could be what is going on here.  But making a finding that a party has engaged in bad faith \nis a pretty serious thing for this Court  to do.  Maybe such a finding would be warranted if it \nreally was clear that  when GSK removed the case,  it knew it stood to lose on Count III in state \ncourt, or  if GSK had by then already suffered some type of adverse decision relating to Count III .  \nCf. Mirowski Fam . Ventures, LLC v. Bos . Sci. Corp., Civil No. WDQ -13-2627, 2014 WL \n2574615, at *6 (D. Md. June 5, 2014)  (citing cases) ; Niadyne , 2013 WL 5943921, at *10.  But \nthe record is not clear that this is what happened here ( as GSK notes ).  (D.I. 8 at 14 n.3)   So the \nCourt concludes that this factor is neutral.6   \n \n6  That sai d, when briefing this factor, GSK also assert ed that its l itigation regarding \nCount III in the Delaware Superior Court , and its subsequent late removal of the case to federal \ncourt , was \u201centirely permissible and not inconsistent with typical litigant practice in such \nsituations .\u201d  (D.I. 8 at 14)   That seems a bridge too far.  The tw o authorities that GSK cites in \nsupport for the  assertion that its conduct here was \u201ctypical\u201d say nothing of the sort .  (D.I. 9 at 4)  \nInstead, both authorities stand for the proposi tion that a defendant\u2019s conduct in defending a state -\ncourt action before t he expiration of the statutory ( i.e., 30-day) removal period does not \nconstitute waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to remove.  See Liebau v. Colom. Cas. Co., 176 F. \nSupp. 2d 1236, 1241, 1243- 44 (D. Kan. 2001) (finding that defendant removed the action 14 \n  In sum, three of the four relevant  factors weigh against a finding of  cause pursuant to \nSection 1454 (with the other being neutral) .7  GSK\u2019s lack of timely action in removing the case \ncaused real delay  in the resolution of the instant dispute, it caused  prejudice to DRIT and it \npromoted inefficiency  in the federal and state court systems .  As a result, the Court cannot find \nthat cause exists for the delay, and so it recommends that DRIT\u2019s Motion be gran ted such that \nthe case is remanded to the Delaware Superior Court .8 \n \n\u201cwithin 30 days of the running of the statutory period\u201d set out in Section 1446, and that \ndefendant\u2019s prior efforts in seeking to set aside a default judgment  and filing an answer and a \nmotion to dismiss  \u201cdid not constitute a waiver of [the defendant\u2019s] right to remove  the cas e\u201d); \n14C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3731 ( 4th ed. \nApr. 2021 update) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s conduct in defending the state -court action prior to the end of \nthe two statutory 30- day periods  established by Section 1446(b) will not constitute waiver of the \nright to remove.\u201d) (emphasis added) .  This proposition is irrelevant here, as GSK\u2019s removal came \nover three years after th e statutory  30-day removal period had expired.  ( See D.I. 9 at 4)   \n \n7  While there are a number of cases in which courts have found that the removing \nparty failed to establish cause for untimely removal under Section 1454, there are only a handful \nof cases in which courts have found cause to be demonstrated.  Generally, i n these latter cases, \nthe delays were short , and there was not extensive litigation in the state court prior to removal.  \nSee, e.g., O\u2019Donnell/Salvatori Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., Case No. C20- 882-MLP, 2020 WL \n5269946, at *3 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 4, 2020)  (concl uding that the defendant timely removed after \nlearning that a copyright claim was at issue and that, even if it did not, the time limitations \nshould be extended for cause shown under Section 1454, because the short delay  in removing the \nmatter  did not prej udice plaintiff, there ha d not been extensive litigation in the state court action \nand the defendant  had filed its notice of removal 71 days after the complaint was filed); Van  \nSteenburg v.  Hageman , No. SA:14- CV-976-DAE, 2015 WL 1509940, at *6 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 31, \n2015)  (finding good cause to extend the 30- day deadline under Section 1454, where the \ndefendants filed their notice of removal 20 days after the deadline and where there was no action \ntaken in the case between the 30 -day deadline and the date  that defendants removed the case , \nsuch that \u201cthe late removal had no impact on the proceeding and did not result in prejudice to \n[p]laintiffs\u201d); Donahue , 2014 WL 12479285, at *7 (concluding that defendants established cause \nunder Section 1454, where the d elay was approximately three weeks and defendants had not first \nextensively litigated in state court).   \n \n8  The parties also dispute whether the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over \nthe claim  at issue \u2014that is, whether there is \u201carising under\u201d juri sdiction in this C ourt as to Count \nIII.  The prototypical case in which such jurisdiction exists is \u201cone in which the federal \ngovernment itself seeks access to a federal forum, an action of the federal government must be \nadjudicated, or where the validity of a federal statute is in question.\u201d   MHA LLC v. HealthFirst, 15 \n An order remanding a case may require payment of just costs and attorney fees incurred \nas a result of the removal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).  With its Motion, DRIT also moves for an award \nof its related costs and expenses, including attorney fees .  (D.I. 5 at 17- 19; D.I. 9 at 9- 10)  Such \nan award is appropriate only if \u201cthe removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for \nseeking removal.\u201d  Martin v. Franklin Cap. Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 141 (2005); see also  Cont\u2019l \nAuto. Sys., Inc. v. Nokia Corp., C.A. No. 21- 345-MN, 2021 WL 5299243, at *4 (D. Del. Nov. \n \nInc., 629 F. App\u2019x 409, 413 n.6 (3d Cir. 2015).  Because the Court has above concluded that \nGSK\u2019s removal of the case is untimely, it need not address this subject matter jurisdiction issue \nin order to recommend that the case be remanded to state court.  See, e.g., Mirowski  Fam.  \nVentures,  LLC , 2014 WL 2574615, at *6 n.24.  That said, the Court notes that it seems unlikely \nthat there is subject matter jurisdiction over Count III .   \n   \nIn their briefing as to this issue, t he parties are disputing the applicability of the third \nGunn factor:  whether the federal issue raised by DRIT\u2019s state law breach of contract claim  (i.e., \nwhether a statutory disclaimer becomes effective on the date that the patentee authorizes the PTO \nto deduct the required fee from a deposit account , or only once the required fee is actually paid) \nis sufficiently \u201c substantial. \u201d  (D.I. 5 at 14 -17; D.I. 8 at 5- 10; D. I. 9 at 6 -9)  The \u201csubstantiality\u201d  \ninquiry looks  to \u201cthe importance  of the issue  to the federal  system  as a whole\u201d and  not the \nsignificance \u201cto the particular  parties  in the immediate  suit.\u201d   Gunn, 568 U.S. at  260.  An  issue  is \nlikely  to be substantial  if it presents  a pure  issue  of law,  the resolution of  whic h would be  \n\u201ccontrolling in  numerous  other  cases.\u201d  Empire  Healthchoice  Assur.,  Inc. v. McVeigh , 547 U.S.  \n677, 700 (2006);  see also  Gunn, 568 U.S.  at 262 (noting that  if a state  law claim  raises  a novel  \nquestion of  patent  law that \u201cdoes  not arise frequently , it is  unlikely to  implicate  substantial  \nfederal  interests\u201d); see also Inspired Dev.  Grp., LLC  v. Inspired Prods. Grp., LLC , 938 F.3d \n1355, 1364 (Fed.  Cir. 2019)  (explaining that  a substantial federal  issue  is more  likely  to be \npresent  if a pure  issue  of federal  law is dispositive  of the case,  if the court\u2019s  resolution of  the \nissue  would control  numerous  other  cases,  and if the government  has a direct  interest  in the \navailability  of a federal  forum  to vindicate  its own  administrative  action).  \n \nHere,  at minimum,  it does  not seem  likely  that the Delaware Superior  Court\u2019s  resolution \nof this issue  would affect  \u201cnumerous  other  cases .\u201d  As DRIT  points  out, it appears  that the key \nissue  here is  one that rarely,  if ever,  comes  up in  litigation.   (D.I.  5 at 16; D.I. 9 at 7-8)  GSK \nspeculates  about  some  hypothetical  related  scenarios  that might  occur  in future  cases .  (D.I.  8 at \n8)  But  it points  to no credible evidence suggesting that  this type  of fee payment/disclaimer  issue  \nwould be  likely  to occur  frequently in  the future.  (D.I.  9 at 8)  And to the extent  that this issue  \ndoes ever  arise in  the future,  as DRIT  notes, a  federal  court would not  be bound by the  Delaware \nSuperior  Court\u2019s  ruling on a  patent  issue .  Instead,  the federal  court\u2019s  subsequent  resolution of  \nthe issue  would \u201clay[]  to rest any contrary  state  court  precedent.\u201d   (Id. at 8-9 (quoting Gunn, 568 \nU.S. at 262) )   16 \n 15, 2021).  Although GSK\u2019s arguments regarding removal /remand  did not prevail here, they \nwere not without at least  arguable support ; ther efore, the Court denies  DRIT\u2019s request for \nattorney fees and costs.

CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that D RIT\u2019s Motion be GRANTED \nsuch that t he case be remanded.  As to the part of the Motion in which DRIT seeks just costs and \nexpenses, it ORDERS that DRIT\u2019 s request be DENIED .\n9 \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
