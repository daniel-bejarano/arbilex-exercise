Crawford, FRANKLIN & PROKOPIK, Wilmington, Delaware. \nCounsel for Defendant \nNovember 19, 2021 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Pending before me is a Motion for Entry of Default filed by Plaintiff Patricia \nTaylor pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2). DJ. 7. Plaintiff filed \nthe Complaint on April 14, 2021. Plaintiff contends she served Defendant \nAmerican Van Lines, Inc. (AVL) with the Complaint on April 21, 2021 and again \non May 17, 2021. D.I. 1,r,r 3-4. Defendant disputes that the April 21 service was \neffective. D.I. 9 at 2. It does not dispute the effectiveness of the May 17 service \nand it concedes that it was required under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to \nfile a response to the Complaint no later than June 4, 2021. Id. at 4. Plaintiff filed \nher motion for entry of default on June 16, 2021. A VL entered its appearance on \nJune 18. It filed an opposition to Plaintiffs motion (D.I. 9) on June 24. It filed a \nmotion to dismiss the Complaint on June 25. D.I. 10. \nFor the reasons stated below, I will grant Plaintiffs motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis case stems from Plaintiffs move from Bethany Beach, Delaware to \nMcLean, Virginia. Plaintiff alleges that she arranged for A VL to transport her \nfurniture and household goods for a fee of $9,002.01. D.I. 1 ,r 12. \nPlaintiff alleges that A VL contracted to complete packing and loading in \nDelaware by August 1, 2019 and unloading and delivery in Virginia by August 3, \n1 2019. Id. at ,r 13. In addition, A VL promised to supply trained professional \nmovers, 114 boxes, packing tape, and other materials it estimated would be \nrequired to complete the job. Id. at ,r 14. \nAccording to Plaintiff, when AVL arrived at her home on August 1, 2019, \nit did not have the 114 boxes, packing tape, proper moving equipment, or a \nsufficient number of team members. Id. at ,r,r 28, 31. In addition, two of the five \nteam members were not \"trained professional movers.\" Id. at ,r,r 33, 36. And all of \nthe team members \"behaved in an unprofessional manner by audibly arguing and \nfighting with each other.\" Id. at ,r 44. Plaintiff alleges that these events caused \n\"great emotional distress\" and \"apprehension.\" Id. at ,r,r 32, 38. \nPlaintiff further alleges that late in the evening on August 1, 2019, A VL' s \nteam leader for the move used his size, strength, and loud voice to intimidate \nPlaintiff into paying an additional $7,000 to complete the job, and Plaintiff \nauthorized this additional payment under duress. Id. at ,r,r 54-67. A VL' s team \nleader then drove the partially loaded moving truck to New York without \nPlaintiffs consent. Id. at ,r,r 7 4-87. When the moving truck returned to Plaintiff's \nDelaware home, the contents of the truck were damaged or missing. Id. \nMeanwhile, other household goods belonging to Plaintiff were left outside in the \nrain at her Delaware home. Id. at ,r,r 68, 86. And Plaintiff paid for the remaining \nA VL team members to stay in a hotel for the night based on the promise that they \n2 would return in the morning to complete the packing and loading of her household \ngoods. Id. at ,r,r 80-82. The team members did not return, id., and A VL did not \ndeliver Plaintiffs household goods to Virginia on or before August 3, id. at ,r 88. \nBased on these events, Plaintiff asserts state law claims for unlawful \nimprisonment, terroristic threatening, coercion, extortion, misapplication of \nproperty, negligent hiring and supervision, constructive fraud, fraud in the \ninducement, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of the \nDelaware Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2532, et seq. \nII. LEGALSTANDARDS \nEntry of default judgment is a two-step process. Before obtaining a default \njudgment under Rule 55(b), there must be an entry of default pursuant to Rule \n55(a). l0A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2682 (4th ed.). Under Rule 55(a), the clerk \nmust enter default \"[ w ]hen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief \nis sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by \naffidavit or otherwise.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). \"This first step, entry of default, is a \nministerial step performed by the Clerk of Court.\" Austin v. Nugent, 2016 WL \n7048994, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Dec. 5, 2016). \nAfter entry of default, if the relief sought against the defaulted party is not \nfor a \"sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation,\" the party \nseeking default judgment must apply to the court for an entry of default judgment. \n3 Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). The entry of default judgment is \"left primarily to the \ndiscretion of the district court,\" but \"[t]his discretion is not without limits,\" \nbecause \"cases should be disposed of on the merits whenever practicable.\" Hritz v. \nWoma Corp., 732 F.2d 1178, 1180-1181 (3d Cir. 1984). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nCourts use the same standard to set aside an entry of default that they use to \nenter a default judgment. Sourcecorp Inc. v. Croney, 412 F. App'x 455,459 (3d \nCir. 2011). That standard has three factors: \"(l) whether the plaintiff will be \nprejudiced; (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) whether \nthe default was the result of the defendant's culpable conduct.\" Id. Each factor is \ndiscussed in tum. \nA. Meritorious Defense \nThe meritorious-defense factor is considered the \"threshold issue\" in setting \naside a default. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Starlight Ballroom Dance Club, Inc., \n175 F.App'x519, 522 (3d Cir. 2006). A defendant does not \"have the right to \nhave a default ... set aside automatically upon alleging a defense.\" Barad v. Aetna \nCas. & Sur. Co., 839 F .2d 979, 982 (3d Cir. 1988). The \"standard is more \nstringent.\" Nationwide, 175 F. App'x at 522. It requires a defendant to \"set forth \nwith some specificity the grounds for his defense.\" Id. \"The showing of a \nmeritorious defense is accomplished when 'allegations of defendant's answer, if \n4 established on trial, would constitute a complete defense to the action.\"' United \nStates v. $55,518.05 in U.S. Currency, 728 F.2d 192, 195 (3d Cir. 1984) (quoting \nTozer v. Charles A. Krause Mill. Co., 189 F .2d 242, 244 (3d Cir. 1951 )). \nHere, A VL did not establish a meritorious defense. In a conclusory fashion, \nA VL invokes \"the Carmack amendment\" and asserts that that amendment \n\"preempts state law claims.\" D.I. 9 at 5-6. A VL does not identify the specific \nstatute associated with the Carmack Amendment, does not recite the statutory \nlanguage showing that the Carmack Amendment governs A VL 's transaction with \nPlaintiff, and does not provide any legal analysis showing that, under binding \nprecedent, the Carmack amendment preempts all ten of Plaintiff's state law claims. \nInstead, A VL provides a string cite of cases, most of which are from other \nappellate circuits, and none of which address preemption of the specific state law \nclaims Plaintiff asserts here. Id. \"[S]imple denials or conclusionary statements\" \nare not enough to establish a meritorious defense. United States v. $55,518.05 in \nU.S. Currency, 728 F.2d 192, 195 (3d Cir. 1984). Because AVL has not shown \nthat the Carmack Amendment is a complete defense against all of Plaintiffs' state \nlaw claims, A VL has not established a meritorious defense. \nA VL also asserts that five of Plaintiff's ten state law claims fail to state a \nclaim, because they are based on criminal statutes. Id. at 6. Indeed, the complaint \nitself cites the applicable criminal statutes. See D.I. 1 ,r,r 94-123. Those state law \n5 claims are unlawful imprisonment, terroristic threatening, coercion, extortion, and \nmisapplication of property. Because none of the criminal statutes provide a private \ncause of action, Plaintiff cannot assert a civil claim based on these criminal \nstatutes. Brett v. Berkowitz, 706 A.2d 509, 512 (Del. 1998). Accordingly, AVL is \ncorrect that these claims would not survive a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, this \nargument only disposes of half of Plaintiff's claims. Because the other five state \nlaw claims would remain, A VL has not established a complete defense and, \ntherefore has not established a meritorious defense. Accordingly, this factor \nweighs in favor of not setting aside an entry of default. \nB. Delay Due to Culpable Conduct \nTo show culpable conduct, \"more than mere negligence must be \ndemonstrated.\" Nationwide, 175 F. App'x at 523 (cleaned up). Cases where courts \nhave found a lack of culpability \"typically involved innocent mishaps or mere \nmistakes.\" Id. (collecting cases). \nHere, it is difficult to conclude that A VL lacked culpability, because A VL \ndoes not fully explain the cause of its delay. A VL states that it had until June 4, \n2021 to respond to the Complaint. D.I. 9 at 4. A VL further states that \"[b]oth the \ninsurer and undersigned counsel (less than 24 hours after being retained), contacted \nPlaintiff's counsel to seek an extension of time to respond.\" D.I. 9 at 6-7. \nSpecifically, AVL's insurer sought an extension from Plaintiff's counsel on June \n6 15, 2012, and AVL's counsel did the same on June 16, 2021. D.I. 9-2, Bxs. C, D. \nWhat A VL does not explain, however, is the cause of the delay between June 4 and \nJune 15. The absence of any explanation does not reflect well on A VL, \nconsidering that these facts are exclusively within its possession. Because A VL \nfailed to explain why it missed the June 4 deadline, this factor weighs in favor of \nentering a default judgment. \nC. Prejudice to Plaintiff \n\"Prejudice is established ... when a plaintiff's ability to pursue the claim \nhas been hindered by, for example, loss of available evidence, increased potential \nfor fraud or collusion, or substantial reliance upon the judgment.\" Nationwide, 175 \nF. App'x at 523 (cleaned up). \"Delay in realizing satisfaction on a claim rarely \nserves to establish a sufficient degree of prejudice.\" Id. \nPlaintiff asserts that she will be prejudiced if this Court sets aside a default, \n\"because she will continue to be harassed and damaged by Defendant, i.e., \nDefendant's orchestration of its defense.\" D.I. 12 at 9. Plaintiff does not identify \nany concrete acts of harassment by A VL during the course of this litigation. \nInstead, Plaintiff appears to contend that she will be prejudiced if the default is set \naside, because then she will have to participate in the litigation and respond to \nAVL's defense. It is not, however, prejudicial for Plaintiff to have to participate in \nlitigation she initiated. Accordingly, this factor weighs against entry of default. \n7 Nevertheless, because the other two factors weigh in favor of a default entry, \nI will grant Plaintiffs motion for entry of default. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, I will grant Plaintiffs motion for entry of a \ndefault (D.1. 7). \n8 IN THE UNITED ST ATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nPA TRICIA TAYLOR, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nAMERICAN VAN LINES, INC., and \nDOES 1 THROUGH 10, \nDefendants.
