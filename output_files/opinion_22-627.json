No. 22- 627 (MN)  \n \nMEMORANDU M ORDER \n At Wilmington, this  25th day of July  2022;  \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff s brought this case in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware, asserting state \nlaw claims of negligence and wrongful death related to the allegation that Maryanna Morra \ncontracted COVID -19 at the Milford Center  and died from it.  Plaintiffs allegations include that \nDefendant s \u201cbreached the duty of ca re in at least the following way s: \na.  Failure to adequately screen visitors and staff to the Milford Center;  \nb.  Failure to properly isolate patients; \nc.  Failure to consistently conduct COVID -19 screenings of patients; and \nd.  Failure to timely refer a patient to a higher level of care when there was a significant  change in condition.\u201d   (D.I. 1- 1 \u00b645).  2 Defendant s removed the case to the District of Delaware \u201cpursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, \n1367, 1441, 1442, 1446, and the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 247d- 6d & 247d- 6e\u201d, further stated that \u201c[t] his Court has original and exclusive federal question \njurisdiction because the Complaint is subject to complete preemption under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (\u201cPREP\u201d) Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d- 6d, and also presents substantial \nand embedded questions of federal law under the Grable  doctrine \u201d and, finally said, that \n\u201c[r]emoval is also proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n 1442(a)(1), which provides for removal when a \ndefendant acts at the direction of a federal officer or agency, and raises a \u2018 colorable federal \ndefense. \u2019\u201d  (D.I. 1 at 1- 2). \nOn June 21, 2022, i n light of Judge Restrepo\u2019s Order in a similar case  Ward v. 700 Marvel \nRoad, C.A. No. 22- 74 (LFR)  and this Court\u2019s Order in yet another similar case  Hudson v. 700 \nMarvel Road, C.A. No. 22- 509 (MN), wherein both cases w ere remanded to Superior Court, the \nCourt issued an Oral Order for the Defendants to show cause why this case should not also be remanded to Superior Court.  (D.I. 7) .  On June 28, 2022, Defendants filed their response to the \nshow cause order (D.I. 8).  On  July 11, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a letter asking the Court if it wanted \nPlaintiffs to respond to the show cause response , indicated that Plaintiffs believe the case was \nwrongly removed, and that Plaintiffs were in the process of preparing a motion to remand when \nthe Order to Show Cause was issued.  (D.I. 9).  \nII. DISCUSSION  \n\u201cIf at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction, [a case removed from state court] shall be remanded.\u201d   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).   A \ndefendant has the burden to show the \u201c existence and continuance of federal [subject matter] \njurisdiction \u201d for removal.  Steel Valley Auth. v. Union Switch & Signal Div., 809 F.2d 1006, 1010 3 (3d Cir. 1987).   \u201cIt is settled that the removal statutes [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441- 1452] are to be strictly \nconstrued against removal and all doubts should be resolved in favor of remand.\u201d   Steel Valley Auth., \n809 F.2d at 1010.  When deciding whether to remand a case, the court is to accept as true all  factual \nallegations in the complaint at the time of removal.   Id. \nAs stated in Maglioli  v. All. HC Holdings LLC , 16 F.4th 393, 402 (3d Cir. 2021) , \u201c[n]ursing \nhomes across the country face similar lawsuits.  The story in all of these cases is essentially the \nsame.  Estates  of deceased nursing- home residents sue the nursing homes  in state court alleging that \nthe nursing homes negligently handled COVID -19.  The nursing homes remove to federal  court on \nthe basis of a  combination of federal -officer removal,  complete preemption, and a substantial federal \nissue.  Nearly every federal district court to confront these cases has dismissed for lack of jurisdiction \nand remanded to the state court .\u201d1  This Court will not disr upt Maglioli \u2019s precedent.2 \nA. The PREP Act  \nThe Maglioli court held that, although the PREP Act creates an exclusive federal cause of \naction, it only does so with respect to claims for \u201c willful misconduct\u201d  arising from the use or \nadministration of a covere d countermeasure under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d- 6d(d)(l ), as defined by the \nAct.  A PREP Act willful misconduct claim requires, among other things, an allegation that a \ndefendant acted \u201c intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose.\u201d   See Maglioli, 16 F.4th at 411 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d- 6d(c)(l)(A)(i)).   As \u201cnowhere in [t he Maglioli complaints] d[id] the \n \n1  The Maglioli  court noted that it appeared to be the first appellate court to decide the present \nissues.  Since Maglioli  on October 20, 2021, however, at least two other appellate courts  \nhave reached the same conclusion:  Saldana v. Glenhaven Healthcare LLC , 27 F.4th  679 \n(9th Cir. 2022) ( February 22, 2022) and Mitchell v.  Advanced HCS, L.L.C., 28 F.4th 580 \n(5th Cir. 2022)  (March 10, 2022). \n \n2  On February 7, 2022, the Third Circuit issued an Order denying Appellants\u2019 petition for \nrehearing by the panel and the Court e n banc  thereby accepting the opinion of the Court as \nfinal.   4 estates allege or imply that the nursing homes acted \u2018 intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose, \u2019\u201d \nand despite allegations of willful misconduct to support a demand for punitive damages, id. at 411, \nthe Maglioli court concluded that the \u201cnegligence claims do not fall within scope of the exclusive \nfederal cause of action [and are therefore] not completely preempted, so they belong in state court. \u201d  \nId. at  408.  \nHere, as in Maglioli, Plaintiff s do not allege that Defendant s acted intentionally to achieve \na wrongful purpose.  In fact, the word \u201cintentional\u201d does not appear in the Complaint.  Plaintiffs \u2019 \nComplaint has two Counts \u2013 Negligence and Wrongful Death.  As the Maglioli Court explained:   \nWillful misconduct is a separate cause of  action from negligence. \nThe elements of the state cause of  action need not \u2018 precisely \nduplicate \u2019 the elements of the  federal cause of action for complete \npreemption to apply.  Davila , 542 U.S. at 216, 124 S.Ct. 2488.  But \ncomplete  preemption does not apply when federal law creates an  \nentirely different cause of action from the state claims in the  \ncomplaint.  See DiFelice v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare , 346 F.3d 442, \n452\u201353 (3d Cir. 2003).  Congress could have created  a cause of \naction for negligence or general tort liability.  It did  not.  Just as \nintentional torts, strict liability, and negligence  are inde pendent \ncauses of action, so too willful misconduct  under the PREP Act is \nan independent cause of action. \n \nMaglioli, 16 F.4th at 411. \n As Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint does not have the required willful misconduct independent cause \nof action, it is not completely preempted.  \n B. The Grable Doctrine  \nMaglioli also considered whether the possibility of an affirmative defense under the PREP \nAct created federal question jurisdiction pursuant to Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue 5 Engineering & Mfg., 546 U.S. 308 (2005)3 \u2013 and concluded that the existence of such a defense \ndoes not support removal : \n\u2018Federal preemption is ordinarily a federal  defense to the plaintiff \u2019s \nsuit.  As a defense, it does not appear  on the face of a well -pleaded \ncomplaint, and, therefore, does  not authorize removal to federal \ncourt.\u2019   Metro. Life Ins. Co., 481 U.S. at 63, 107 S.Ct. 1542.  Here, \nthe nursing homes  \u2018would at best be entitled to a preemption \ndefense \u2019 under the PREP Act.  Manning v. Merrill Lynch Pierce \nFenner  & Smith, Inc ., 772 F.3d 158, 165 (3d Cir. 2014), aff \u2019d, 578  \nU.S. 374, 136 S.Ct. 1562, 194 L.Ed.2d 671 (2016).  The estates \nwould properly plead their state -law negligence claims  without \nmentioning the PREP Act, so the PREP Act is not \u2018 an essential \nelement of the plain tiff[s\u2019] state law claim. \u2019  Id. at 163.  We therefore \nlack federal -question jurisdiction under  Grable.  \n \nMaglioli, 16 F.4th at 411. \n As Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint plead ed their state -law negligence claim without mentioning the \nPREP Act , the PREP Act is not \u201can essential element of the plaintiff[s\u2019] state law claim\u201d  and, \ntherefore, this Court lacks federal -question jurisdiction under Grable . \n C. Federal Officer Removal Stat ute \nFor a defendant to remove a case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71442(a)(1) , four requirements must be \nmet:  (1) the defendant must be a \u201c person \u201d within the meaning of  the statute; (2) the plaintiff \u2019s \nclaims must be based upon the  defendant \u201cacting under \u201d the United States, its agencies, or its  \nofficers; (3) the plaintiff \u2019s claims against the defendant must be \u201c for or relating to \u201d an act under \ncolor of federal office;  and (4) the defendant must raise a colorable federal defense to  the \nplaintiff \u2019s claims.   Maglioli, 16 F.4th at 404 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1) and Papp v. Fore -\nKast Sales Co., 842 F.3d 805, 812 (3d Cir. 2016) ).   \n \n3  The Grable  court held that \u201c test for jurisdiction over federal issues embedded in state-law \nclaims between nondiverse parties \u201d is whether \u201cstate-law claim[s]  necessarily raise a stated \nfederal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a  federal forum may entertain \nwithout disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial \nresponsibilities \u201d.  Grable , 545 U.S. at 314. 6 In their response to the Court\u2019s Show Cause Order, Defendants argue that this case is \n\u201cfactually distinguishable\u201d and \u201cprovides a more robust factual record than Maglioli \u201d and, \ntherefore, can be removed pursuant to the federal office removal statute .  Defendants contend \nthat \u201cnursing facilities went beyond regulatory compliance in assisting federal agencies to carry \nout the federal government \u2019s COVID -19 response and policy objectives.\u201d  (D.I. 8 at  2-3).  The \nCourt disagrees.   \nThe Maglioli  court found that \u201cnursing homes were not \u2018acting under\u2019 the United States, \nits agencies, or its officers.\u201d  Maglioli , 16 F.4th at 404.  As n ursing homes  are private parties, \nthey can, however, invoke the federal -officer removal statute if they can show that they were \n\u201cacting under\u201d federal officers.  Id. , see also Watson v. Philip Morris Cos., 551 U.S. 142, 147, \n127 S.C t. 2301, 168 L.Ed.2d 42 (2007).  Alt hough the phrase \u201cacting under\u201d is broad and \nconstrued liberally, it is not boundless:  \nMerely complying with  federal laws and regulations is not \u2018 acting \nunder \u2019 a federal  officer for purposes of federal -officer removal.  Id. \nat 153, 127 S.Ct. 2301.  Even a firm subject to detailed regulations  \nand whose \u2018activities are highly supervised and monitored\u2019  is not \n\u2018acting under \u2019 a federal officer.  Id.  The nursing homes must \ndemonstrate something beyond regulation or  compliance.  They \nmust show that their actions \u2018 involve an effort to assist , or to help \ncarry out , the duties or tasks  of the federal superior.\u2019  Id. at 152, 127 \nS.Ct. 2301.  \n \nMaglioli, 16 F.4th at 404. \nThe Maglioli  court further went on to say:  \nThe nursing homes here do not assist or help carry out the duties of \na federal superior.  They are not government contract ors. . . .  They \nare not delegated federal authority, nor do they provide a service that the federal government would otherwise provide.   \nMaglioli, 16 F.4th at 405 (citing  Papp, 842 F.3d a t 812\u201313; In re Commonwealth\u2019 s Motion to \nAppoint Couns. Against  or Directed to Def. Ass \u2019n of Phila., 790 F.3d 457, 469 (3d Cir. 2015). 7 \n Here, the same conclusion  is warranted .  Defendants were not \u201cacting under\u201d a federal \nofficer , they have not demonstrated something beyond regulation or compliance, they are not \ngovernment contractors, and they are not providing a service that the federal government would \notherwise provide.  Therefore, removal pursuant to the f ederal officer statute fails and this case \nmust be remanded  to state court.4 \nAs Defendants have not met their burden to show the \u201cexistence and continuance of federal \n[subject matter] jurisdiction\u201d for removal and in accordance with Maglioli, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that thi s matter is REMAND ED to the Superior Court of the State of Delaware.  \n \n \n             \n      The Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n      United States District Judge  \n \n4  Because the Court has concluded that Defendants were not \u201cacting under\u201d the United \nStates, its agencies, or its  officer s, one of the four elements that must be met in order to \nremove  a case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71442(a)(1), it need not reach the remaining elements.
