Picollelli, Jr., Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of\nJustice, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDecember | , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nfi / | \\ \u201c\nS, U.S. District Judge:\n\nWILLI:\n\nOn November 13, 2020, Plaintiff Ruth Mossinger who appears pro se and\nhas paid the filing fee, commenced this employment discrimination and retaliation\nclaim pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42\nUS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, et. seg. (D1I.1) Before the Court is Defendant\u2019s motion to\ndismiss (D.I. 15) and Plaintiff\u2019s response to the Court\u2019s order to show cause! (D.I.\n20).\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendant State of Delaware Division of Child Support\nServices discriminated against her on the basis of a disability and subjected her to\nretaliation when she sought an accommodation for her disability. The Complaint\nalleges a \u201cviolation of fitness for duty recommendation that [Plaintiff] not drive\nmore than 25 miles (one way)\u201d due to a neck and back condition that \u201ccauses\ntemp[orary] paralysis when driving. (D.I. 1 at2) A treating physician\u2019s form\nindicates that Plaintiff was able to return to work with restrictions as of August 12,\n2019; that she can work eight hours/day for forty hours/week, that she can alternate\nwith sitting/standing every two hours and can sit for longer but needs to be able to\n\ntake breaks or change positions; that Plaintiff\u2019s symptoms are worse on longer car\n\n' On August 18, 2022, the Court entered an order to show cause for Plaintiff's failure to\nprosecute the case. (See D.I. 19)\n\n1\ndrives; that driving to work more than 75 miles makes Plaintiff start the day with\nsymptoms; and, suggested Plaintiff limit driving to no more than 25 miles to\nimprove functional ability. (D.I. 1-1 at 3-6)\n\nPlaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC on October 23,\n2019, EEOC No. 530-2019-04879 asserting discrimination took place on August\n19, 2019, and is continuing. (D.I. 1-1 at1) The charge also asserts retaliation.\n(id.) The charge states that Defendant ignored Plaintiff's request to not drive\nmore than 25 miles because of her disability, that an accommodation exists via\nwork at the Georgetown office, no reason was given for the denial of the\naccommodation and, after Plaintiff requested the accommodation, Defendant\nretaliated through criticism and sending Plaintiff emails \u201cnitpicking\u201d at her. (/d.)\nThe EEOC issued Plaintiff a notice suit rights dated August 17,2020. (D.I.9 at\n2) Plaintiff filed this action on November 13, 2020.\n\nDefendant moves to dismiss the Complaint on the grounds that the\nComplaint fails to state claims of discrimination and retaliation under the ADA.\n(D.I. 15, 16) Plaintiffs response to the Court\u2019s order to show cause contains her\nopposition to the motion. (D.L. 20)\n\nTl. LEGAL STANDARDS\nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the\n\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the\nlight most favorable to Plaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).\nBecause Plaintiff proceeds pro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94. A court\nmay consider the pleadings, public record, orders, exhibits attached to the\ncomplaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference. Tellabs,\nInc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Lid., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).\n\nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim\nof entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u2019\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,\n241 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). The Court is \u201cnot\nrequired to credit bald assertions or legal conclusions improperly alleged in the\ncomplaint.\u201d Jn re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. See. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d\nCir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed, however, \u201cfor imperfect statement\nof the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\u201d Johnson v. City of Shelby, 135\n\nS. Ct. 346, 346 (2014).\nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has\n\u201csubstantive plausibility.\u201d Jd. at 347. That plausibility must be found on the face\nof the complaint. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \u201cA claim has\nfacial plausibility when the [complainant] pleads factual content that allows the\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the [accused] is liable for the\nmisconduct alleged.\u201d Jd. Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial\nexperience and common sense.\u201d Id. at 679.\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nDefendant moves to dismiss the ADA discrimination/failure to\naccommodate claim on the grounds that an inability or unwillingness to drive to\nand from work is not considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities\nAct, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, et seq. Plaintiff opposes.\n\nTo establish a prima facie case under the ADA, Plaintiff must establish that\nshe (1) has a disability, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) has suffered an adverse\nemployment action because of that disability. McNelis v. Pennsylvania Power &\nLight Co., 867 F.3d 411, 414 (3d Cir. 2017). To state a claim for disability\ndiscrimination under the ADA based on an alleged failure to accommodate a\ndisability, Plaintiff must demonstrate that she: (1) is a disabled person within the\n\nmeaning of the ADA; (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions\nof the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3)\nhas suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of\ndiscrimination which includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations for\nher disability. See Hohider v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 186-87 (3d\nCir. 2009). The ADA defines \u201cdisability\u201d as either: (i) \u201ca physical or mental\nimpairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such\n[an] individual\u201d; (ii) \u201ca record of such an impairment\u201d; or (iii) \u201cbeing regarded as\nhaving such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2). |\n\nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs claim she is disabled because she cannot\ndrive more than 25 miles due to her back and neck conditions fails because\ncommuting is not considered a \u201cmajor life activity.\u201d (D.I. 16 at 10) Plaintiff\nresponds that she survived more than five years of driving while her back\nprogressively worsened and \u201cthey\u201d provided no relief. (D.I. 20 at 1)\n\nIn 2007, our Circuit stated that \u201cdriving is not a major life activity.\u201d\nRobinson v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 212 F. App\u2019x 121, 124 (d Cir. 2007) (citing\nChenoweth y. Hillsborough Cty., 250 F.3d 1328, 1329-30 (11 Cir. 2001) and\nColwell v. Suffolk Cty. Police Dep\u2019t, 158 F.3d 635, 643 (2d Cir. 1998). Following\namendments to the ADA, effective January 1, 2009, this District Court thoroughly\nanalyzed the issue of whether driving is a major life activity and concluded that it |\n\nisnot. See Thomas v. Astrue, 2012 WL 6011878, at *2-4, D. Del. Nov. 30, 2012).\nThis Court agrees with that analysis and, upon review of the Complaint and\nDefendant\u2019s position, finds the Complaint fails to state claims for disability\ndiscrimination/failure to accommodate under the ADA.\n\nDefendant also moves for dismissal of the retaliation claim on the grounds\nPlaintiff does not plead facts that constitute an adverse action. Plaintiff responds\nthat she has had her character assassinated, slandered, been held against her will,\nforced to falsify records, written up, and provoked. (D.I. 20 at 1) None of these\nclaims are contained in the Complaint or charge of discrimination. Instead,\nPlaintiff states that Defendant was \u201cextra critical of her\u2019 when it sent Plaintiff\nemails nitpicking at her. (D.I. 2 at 3)\n\nTo state a claim for retaliation under the ADA, an employee must show (1)\nshe engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employer took adverse action; and (3) a\ncausal connection. Fogleman v. Mercy Hosp., 283 F.3d 561, 567-68 (3d Cir.\n2002) (citing Krouse v. American Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1997)).\nAs alleged, at most Plaintiff's retaliation allegations fall under the category of\n\u201ctrivial harms\u201d and do not rise to the level of an adverse action. See\nMondzelewski v. Pathmark Stores, Inc., 162 F.3d 778, 787 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(\u201c[Mlinor or trivial actions that merely make an employee \u2018unhappy\u2019 are not\nsufficient to qualify as retaliation under the ADA. ...\u201d); see also Sconfienza v.\n\nVerizon Pa. Inc., 307 F. App\u2019x 619, 622, 624 (3d Cir. 2008) (finding that \u201charsh\nwords that lack real consequences are not\u201d enough to show an adverse action);\nNolan v. Swartz Campbell, LLC, 2008 WL 598291, at *20 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 29,\n2008) (\u201c[MlJerely experiencing some apprehension and subjectively feeling\nintimidated from .. . a conversation hardly amounts to the type [of] measures that\nthe courts have found sufficient to support a claim of retaliation.\u201d).\n\nAs alleged, the Complaint fails to state a retaliation claim under the ADA.\nTherefore, the claim will be dismissed.\n\nBecause Plaintiff may be able to state claims if properly pled, and in light of\nher pro se status, she will be given leave to amend.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will grant Defendant\u2019s motion to\ndismiss. (D.1.15) Plaintiff will be given leave to amend.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nRUTH MOSSINGER,\nPlaintiff,\n\nv. Civ.
