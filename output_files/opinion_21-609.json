Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNovember  17, 2021 \nWilmington, Delaware  \n  2 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \nPlaintiff Basavaraj Hooli,  who appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis , filed this action  on April 29, 2021.   (D.I. 2 ).  I will review \nand screen the Complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).       \nBACKGROUND  \n  Plaintiff filed this action as an appeal from a decision of the Justice of the Peace \nCourt of Delaware in and for Kent County.  (D.I. 2 at 1).   The state court matter was \ndismissed for Plaintiff\u2019s failure to serve a  complaint  that he had filed  against Jeanine \nKleim who is also a defendant in the instant case.  (Id. at 3-4). \n Plaintiff  explains that he was homeless and went to the Dover Interfaith Mission.  \n(Id. at 5).  At some point, he was hospitalized due to COVID, and  during the \nhospitalization his personal belongings, including a gold ring and a neck chain and two \npassport, were taken.  ( Id. at 1).  He places a value of about $ 13,750 on the stolen \nitems.  ( Id. at 5 ).  Plaintiff claims that Interfaith personnel are responsible for the lost \nitems.  ( Id. at 5 -6).    \nLEGAL STANDARDS  \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201c the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief. \u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d \nCir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions).  The Court \nmust accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most 3 \n favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d \nCir. 2008) .   \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d 366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or d elusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id.    \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, \nbefore dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may \nbe granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915, the Court must \ngrant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or \nfutile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se and, therefore, his pleading is liberally construed and his  \nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfull y pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers. \u201d  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89,  94 (2007 ).  \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), a motion to dismiss may be granted only if, accepting the well-\npleaded allegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most  \nfavorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations  \u201ccould not raise a \nclaim of entitlement to relief. \u201d  Bell At l. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).  \n \u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations \u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more \nthan simply provide \u2018 labels and conclusions \u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of \na cause of action. \u2019\u201d  Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019 I Hosp ., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014)  4 \n (quoting Twombl y, 550 U.S. at 555).  In addition, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to \nshow that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. \n10 (2014).   A complaint may not be dismissed, however, for  imperfect statements of \nthe le gal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id . at 1 1. \n When reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint, a court should follow a three- step \nprocess: (1) consider the elements  necessary to state a claim ; (2) identify allegations \nthat are merely  conclusions a nd therefore are not well -pleaded factual allegations; and \n(3) accept any  well-pleaded factual allegations  as true and determine whether they \nplausibly state a claim .  See Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp. , 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. \n2016) ; Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC , 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014).  Deciding \nwhether a claim is plausible will be a \u201c context -specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. \u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION  \n The Complaint will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  I have reviewed the \nComplaint and it does not raise a federal civil claim for violations of the United States \nConstitution or federal statutes.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.  While it is not clear whether  \nthe parties are citizens of different states , it is clear that the claimed damages are \nsignificantly below what is required for diversity jurisdiction.  See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.   \nFinally, to the extent Plaintiff seeks to appeal a state court order, his remedy does not \nlie in federal court.   There is no appellate jurisdiction in this Court for appeals from \nstate court , and, in particular, from a Justice of the Peace Court.  5 \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons,  the Court will the dismiss  the Complaint for want of \njurisdiction.  T he Court finds amendment futile.   \nAn appropriate order will be entered.  \n \n  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \n \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nBASAVARAJ HOOLI,      : \n:    \nPlaintiff,   : \n: \nv.    : Civil Action No. 21 -609-RGA  \n: \nJEANINE KLEIM, JR., et al.,   : \n: \nDefendants.   : \n \n \nORDER \n \nAt Wilmington this 17th day of November , 2021 , consistent with the Memorandum \nOpinion issued this date;  \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:  \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED  for want of jurisdiction.  Amendment is \nfutile.  \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE  the case.   \n \n /s/ Richard G.
