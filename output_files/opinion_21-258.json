( collective BSC) for infringement of \nU.S. Patent Nos. 10,556,112 (the #112 patent); 10,576,286 (the #286 patent); \n8,892,209 (the #209 patent); 8,792,988 (the #988 patent); and 9,333,357 (the #357 \npatent). D.I. 1 at 1. Pending before me is BSC's motion to dismiss. D.I. 10. BSC \nargues I should dismiss Nevro's complaint because the asserted patents are invalid \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 for failing to claim patentable subject matter. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis motion to dismiss comes before me in the most recent of many \nintellectual property suits between BSC and Nevro. See Nevro Corp. v. Bos. Sci. \nCorp., 955 F.3d 25 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Bos. Sci Corp. v. Nevro, No. 16-1163; Bos. \nSci Corp. v. Nevro, No. 18-0644. BSC and Nevro are medical device \nmanufacturers that develop and sell spinal cord stimulation (SCS) systems for the \ntreatment of chronic pain. D.I. 1 ,r,r 6-7. SCS systems reduce pain by delivering \nelectrical pulses to the spinal cord. D.I. 1 ,r 2. Previously SCS systems produced a \nsensation known as paresthesia-which is often described as tingling, numbness, \nor pins-and-needles. D.I. 1 ,r 3. Nevro introduced SCS systems that reduce pain \nwithout paresthesia. D.I. 1 ,r 5. The asserted patents claim systems and methods for paresthesia-free pain \nrelief using SCS systems. Nevro alleges that BSC infringes at least claim 1 of each \nasserted patent. D.I. 1 ,I,I 28, 45, 63, 80, 98. Claim 1 of the #286 patent recites \n[a] method for reducing or eliminating pain in a patient, \nwithout causing paresthesia in the patient, the method \ncomprising: \nprogramming a computer-readable medium of an \nimplanted signal generator to: \ngenerate a non-paresthesia-producing therapy \nsignal, wherein at least a portion of the therapy \nsignal is at a frequency of from 500 Hz to 1.2 kHz, \nwith a pulse width in a pulse width range from 10 \nmicroseconds to 50 microseconds, and a current \namplitude in a current amplitude range from 0.5 \nmA to 20 mA; and \ntransmit the therapy signal to the dorsal column \nof the patient's spinal cord via a signal delivery \ndevice implanted in the patient's epidural space \nand electrically coupled to the implanted signal \ngenerator. \nClaim 1 of the # 112 patent recites \n[a] spinal cord stimulation system for reducing or \neliminating pain in a patient, the system comprising: \nan implantable signal generator that, in operation, \ngenerates a non-paresthesia-producing therapy signal, \nwherein at least a portion of the therapy signal is at a \nfrequency of from 500 Hz to 1,200 Hz, with a pulse \nwidth in a pulse width range from 10 microseconds to \n50 microseconds, and a current amplitude in a current \namplitude range from 0.5 mA to 7 mA; and \na signal delivery device electrically coupled to the \nimplantable signal generator to deliver the therapy \nsignal to the dorsal column of the patient's spinal \ncord. \n2 Claim 1 of the #357 patent recites \n[a] spinal cord modulation system for delivering an \nelectrical therapy signal to a patient's spinal cord, \nwherein the system is configured to deliver the electrical \ntherapy signal to the patient's spinal cord via one or more \nimplantable signal delivery devices, the system \ncomprising: \na signal generator coupleable to the one or more \nsignal delivery devices and having executable \ninstructions to generate and deliver the electrical \ntherapy signal to the patient's spinal cord from an \nepidural location via the one or more signal delivery \ndevices, \nwherein the electrical therapy signal has \na plurality of sequential bi-phasic pulses having \na pulse width between 10 microseconds and 333 \nmicroseconds, and \nan amplitude between 0.5 mA and 10 mA, \nwhich at least partially reduces the patient's \nsensation of pain without generating paresthesia. \nClaim 1 of the #988 patent recites \n[a] method for programming a signal generator to \ndeliver a therapy signal to a patient']s spinal cord via at \nleast one implantable signal delivery device, wherein the \nimplantable signal delivery device is positioned to deliver \nthe therapy signal to the patient's spinal cord at a \nvertebral level between T9 and Tl2, inclusively, the \nmethod comprising: \nconfiguring the signal generator to generate a \ntherapy signal, wherein the therapy signal is a \nplurality of bi-phasic pulses having a pulse width \nbetween 25 microseconds and 166 microseconds; and \nprogramming the signal generator to deliver the \ntherapy signal at a frequency and amplitude that at \nleast partially reduces the patient's sensation of pain \nwithout generating paresthesia. \n3 Claim 1 of the #209 patent recites \n[a] spinal cord modulation system for reducing or \neliminating pain in a patient, the system comprising: \na pulse generator configured to generate a non\u00ad\nparesthesia producing therapy signal, wherein the \ntherapy signal includes a plurality, of sequential bi\u00ad\nphasic pulses with pulse widths between 10 \nmicroseconds to 333 microseconds; and \nan implantable signal delivery device electrically \ncoupled to the pulse generator and configured to. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Stating a Cognizable Claim \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a \nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the \ncomplaint must include more than mere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic \nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 555 (2007) ( citation omitted). The complaint must set forth enough \nfacts, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Id. at \n570. A claim is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ( citation \nomitted). Deciding whether a claim is plausible is a \"context-specific task that \n4 requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" \nId. at 679 ( citation omitted). \nWhen assessing the merits of a Rule 12(b )( 6) motion to dismiss, a court \nmust accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and it must view those \nfacts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., \n542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008); Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241,249 (3d Cir. \n2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nB. Patent-Eligible Subject Matter \nSection 101 of the Patent Act defines patent-eligible subject matter: \n\"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, \nor composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain \na patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\" 35 \nu.s.c. \u00a7 101. \nThere are three judicially-created limitations on the literal words of\u00a7 101. \nThe Supreme Court has long held that laws of nature, natural phenomena, and \nabstract ideas are not patentable subject matter. Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int'/, \n573 U.S. 208, 216 (2014). These exceptions to patentable subject matter arise \nfrom the concern that the monopolization of \"these basic tools of scientific and \ntechnological work\" \"might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to \npromote it.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n5 \"[A]n invention is not rendered ineligible for patent [protection] simply \nbecause it involves [ineligible subject-matter].\" Alice, 573 U.S. at 217. \n\"[A]pplication[s] of such [subject matter] to a new and useful end ... remain \neligible for patent protection.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nBut in order \"to transform an unpatentable law of nature [ or abstract idea] into a \npatent-eligible application of such law [or abstract idea], one must do more than \nsimply state the law of nature [or abstract idea] while adding the words 'apply it.\"' \nMayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab 'ys, Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 71 (2012) \n( emphasis omitted). \nIn Alice, the Supreme Court established a two-step framework by which \ncourts are to distinguish patents that claim eligible subject matter under \u00a7 101 from \npatents that do not claim eligible subject matter under \u00a7 101. The court must first \ndetermine whether the patent's claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible concept\u00ad\ni.e., are the claims directed to a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract \nidea? Alice, 573 U.S. at 217. If the answer to this question is no, then the patent is \nnot invalid for teaching ineligible subject matter. If the answer to this question is \nyes, then the court must proceed to step two, where it considers \"the elements of \neach claim both individually and as an ordered combination\" to determine if there \nis an \"inventive concept-i. e., an element or combination of elements that is \nsufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a \n6 patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.\" Id. at 217-18 (alteration in original) \n(internal quotations and citations omitted). \nIssued patents are presumed to be valid, but this presumption is rebuttable. \nMicrosoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.S. 91, 96 (2011). Subject-matter \neligibility is a matter of law, but the party challenging a patent's validity must \nshow underlying facts by clear and convincing evidence. Berkheimer v. HP Inc., \n881 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Representative Claims \nBSC identifies claim 1 of each patent as representative. D.I. 11 at 13 n.7, 18 \nn.10. Nevro does not respond. Accordingly, I adopt claim 1 of each patent as \nrepresentative. In addition, neither party argues that any of the patents present \ndistinct questions at step one of the Alice test, and, therefore, the parties implicitly \naccept that all asserted patents are directed to the same subject matter. \nB. Alice Step One-Whether the Claims Are Drawn to Patent\u00ad\nIneligible Subject Matter \nI begin with the first step of the Alice framework and determine if the claims \nat issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept. Alice, 573 U.S. at 217. \"Laws \nof nature and natural phenomena are not patentable, but applications and uses of \nsuch laws and phenomena may be patentable. \" Illumina, Inc. v. Ariosa \nDiagnostics, Inc., 967 F.3d 1319, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2020), cert. dismissed, 141 S. Ct. \n7 2171 (2021 ). The Federal Circuit has consistently found methods of treatment \npatents subject-matter eligible-even when the claims do not require medical \ndevices. See, e.g., Nat. Alternatives Int'/, Inc. v. Creative Compounds, LLC, 918 \nF.3d 1338, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"[C]laims that are directed to particular methods \nof treatment are patent eligible.\"); Endo Pharms. Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., \n919 F.3d 1347, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2019); see also lllumina, Inc. v. Ariosa \nDiagnostics, Inc., 967 F.3d at 1325 (\"[W]e have held that method of treatment \nclaims are patent-eligible.\"). \nThe asserted patent claims, when considered as a whole, are directed to \nsystems and methods for treatment that incorporate a natural phenomenon, not the \nnatural phenomenon itself. Each patent requires an \"implantable signal generator\" \nor \"implantable signal delivery device.\" #286 patent at claim 1 (14:63); #112 \npatent at claim 1 (15:8); #357 patent at claim 1 (25:66-67); #988 patent at claim 1 \n(25:64-65); #209 patent at claim 1 (25:54). Each patent further requires that the \nsignal delivery devices are configured to generate therapeutic electrical pulses \nwithin specified parameter ranges. #286 patent at claim 1 (14:64-15:2); #112 \npatent at claim 1 (15:8-14); #357 patent at claim 1 (26:6-12); #988 patent at claim \n1 (26:1-4); #209 patent at claim 1 (25:49-53). And each patent specifies that the \nclaimed methods and systems must deliver or be configured to deliver the \nelectrical pulses to the patient's spinal cord. #286 patent at claim 1 (15:3-5); #112 \n8 patent at claim 1 (15:15-17); #357 patent at claim 1 (25:63-66); #988 patent at \nclaim 1 (25 :65-67); #209 patent at claim 1 (25 :54-56). These additional claim \nelements are much more than window dressing for a natural phenomenon. The \nFederal Circuit has repeatedly explained that there is a difference between applying \na natural phenomenon to a useful end and claiming the natural phenomenon itself. \nFor example, the Federal Circuit has found that a claim teaching the manufacture \nof \"a human dietary supplement with certain characteristics\" was subject-matter \neligible, because the \"supplement is not a product of nature and the use of the \nsupplement to achieve a given result is not directed to a law of natures.\" Nat. \nAlternatives, 918 F.3d at 1350. Similarly, an SCS system is not a natural \nphenomenon, and neither is the use of such systems to \"achieve a given result,\" \nsuch as paresthesia-free pain relief. The systems and methods claimed in the \nasserted patents are subject-matter eligible inventions for the useful purpose of \ntreating chronic pain. They are not subject matter ineligible because they happen \nto incorporate a natural phenomenon in realizing that purpose. \nBSC argues that to identify what a patent is directed to I must look to the \n\"focus of the claimed advance over the prior art.\" D.I. 11 at 11 (citing Intellectual \nVentures I LLC v. Capital One Fin. Corp., 850 F.3d 1332, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2017)). \nAccording to BSC, this approach reveals that the asserted claims are \"directed to \nthe natural phenomenon of paresthesia-free therapy with conventional instructions \n9 to apply it.\" D.I. 11 at 13. BSC argues that paresthesia-free therapy is the \ndistinguishing feature of the asserted patents, and that, therefore, the patents are \ndirected to paresthesia-free therapy. D.I. 11 at 14. Since paresthesia-free pain \nrelief is a natural physiological reaction that occurs in response to certain electrical \npulses, the patents, according to BSC, are directed to patent-ineligible subject \nmatter. D.I. 11 at 15. \nBSC' s analysis, however, fails to consider the asserted claims as a whole. \nAthena Diagnostics, Inc. v. Mayo Collaborative Servs., LLC, 915 F.3d 743, 750 \n(Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"The step one 'directed to' inquiry focuses on the claim as a \nwhole.\"), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 855 (2020); see also Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. \n175, 188 (1981). It is true that identifying the \"focus of the claimed advance\" of a \npatent can help identify whether that patent is directed to an abstract idea, and the \nFederal Circuit recognizes the utility of this approach. Intellectual Ventures I, 850 \nF.3d at 1338 (\"Under the abstract idea step we evaluate the focus of the claimed \nadvance over the prior art to determine if the claim's character as a whole is \ndirected to excluded subject matter.\" (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted)). But BSC stretches this methodology past its breaking point. The Alice \ninquiry does not myopically focus on a claim's novel features when the claim as a \n10 whole suggests a different focus.1 See Mayo, 566 U.S. at 71 (\"[A] process is not \nunpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical \nalgorithm.\"); Endo Pharms., 919 F.3d at 1353 (\"[A]t step one, it is not enough to \nmerely identify a patent-ineligible concept underlying the claim.\"). \nHere the claims as a whole are directed to systems and methods for \ntreatment using SCS systems. They extend beyond the idea of paresthesia-free \ntreatment itself, as they require specialized medical devices, particular signal \nproperties, and the delivery of electrical pulses to a patient's spinal cord. See, e.g., \n#286 patent at claim 1. The fact that they incorporate natural phenomena is of no \nmoment. Medicinal treatment necessarily relies on physiological phenomena and \nthat fact does not render all method of treatment patents invalid under \u00a7 101. See \nNat. Alternatives, 918 F.3d at 1345 (recognizing that methods of treatment \nnecessarily rely on the human body's physiological responses). \nBSC reliance on Mayo and /NO Therapeutics LLC v. Praxair Distribution, \nInc., 782 F. App'x 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2019) is unavailing. The patent in Mayo \nidentified only the relationship between certain metabolites and safe dosages of a \n1 BSC strongly suggests that the asserted patents are either anticipated by or \nobvious over the Oakley reference. See D.I. 11 at 9-1 0; see also D.I. 12, Ex E \n(Oakley reference). But\u00a7 101 and\u00a7 102 (and\u00a7 103) impose distinct requirements \nfor eligibility, and it would be improper to rule on\u00a7 102 (or\u00a7 103) under the guise \nof\u00a7 101. \n11 drug; it did not offer an inventive method of treatment. 566 U.S. at 77. And in \nINO the asserted claim simply identified a group of patients that experienced \nadverse results when given iNO gas to treat hypoxic respiratory failure. 782 F. \nApp 'x at 1005. Here, in contrast, the asserted claims are directed to systems and \nmethods for treatment that go beyond simply identifying a physiological reaction. \nBSC is careful to not suggest that SCS technology in general is ineligible for \npatent protection. Indeed, in parallel litigation BSC is accusing Nevro's SCS \nsystem of infringing numerous BSC patents on SCS technology. See Bos. Sci. \nCorp., No. 16-1163. Agreeing with BSC on the present motion would require a \nconclusion that when an otherwise patentable invention incorporates a natural \nphenomenon as part of an additional claim limitation, the invention is no longer \neligible for patent protection. But \"[a] claim to otherwise statutory subject matter \ndoes not become ineligible by its use of a law of nature or natural phenomenon.\" \nJllumina, 961 F.3d at 1324. The asserted claims here are directed to methods of \ntreatment that invoke a natural phenomenon, not to that natural phenomenon itself. \nThe claims are, therefore, not invalid under \u00a7 101. \nC. Alice Step Two--Whether the Claims Contain an Inventive \nConcept \nBecause I find the asserted patents directed to eligible subject matter at step \none of the Alice test, I need not, and do not, consider step two. See Alice, 513 U.S. \nat 218. \n12 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I find the asserted patents not invalid under \u00a7 \n101. Accordingly, I will deny BSC's motion to Dismiss. D.I. 10. \nThe Court will issue Orders consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n13 "}
