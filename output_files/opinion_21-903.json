No. 21-903-LPS\n\nDELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF\nJUSTICE, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nHayward M. Evans, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJune 13, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nan P. Boe.\n\nSTARK, U.S. Circuit Judge:\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Hayward M. Evans (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\" (D.I. 1) He appeats pro se and\nhas been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 6) The Court proceeds to teview and\nscreen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \u00a7 1915A@).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff alleges that on November 15, 2001, when he was a 14-year-old, he was wrongfully\nattested for murder, a crime he did not commit; that the trial began when he was 16; and that\nDefendants Delawate State Police and Delaware Department of Justice had evidence that he was\nnot the killer. (D.I. 1 at 3,5) The evidence consisted of audio recordings of Dania Cannon\n(\u201cCannon\u201d) explaining that Plaintiff was not the shooter. (Id. at 4) Cannon was scheduled to testify\nat Plaintiffs criminal trial but failed to appear. (Id) In 2019, Cannon signed an affidavit that\nptovided evidence about the killing. (Id)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that was wrongfully convicted. He seeks compensatory and punitive\ndamages as well as immediate release from prison. (Id. at 5, 20)\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action swa sponte under the screening provisions of\n28 USS.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted, ot seeks monetaty telief from a defendant who is immune from\nsuch telief.\u201d Ball v. Famigho, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (\u00a2u forma\n\u2018 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some petson has deprived him of a\n\nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See\nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions). The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most\nfavorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally\nconstrued and the Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley \u00bb.\nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Neityke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also\nGrayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhete it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or\ndelusional\u201d factual scenatio.\u201d\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d\n523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) Gi) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule\n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff\nleave to amend unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson, 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Ail. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\n\n2\nU.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do\nmore than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d ot \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a\ncause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to\nstate a claim to telief that is plausible on its face. See Wilkams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306,\n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Asheroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).\nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See\nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect\nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly and Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency\nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they ate no mote than conclusions, ate not entitled to the\nassumption of truth; and (3) when there ate well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume\ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See\nConnelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task\nthat requites the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff's claims fail for several reasons. First, the claims ate time-barred. Plaintiff filed his\nComplaint on April 13, 2021.\u2019 For putposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are\ncharacterized as personal injury actions, Wilson \u00bb. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985), and in Delawate,\n\n? The Court construes the filing date as the date Plaintiff signed the Complaint.\n3\n\u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two-yeat limitations period. See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119; Johnson v. Cullen,\n925 F. Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996). Section 1983 claims accrue \u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or\nshould have known of the injury upon which its action is based.\u201d Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia,\n142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998). \u201cAlthough the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua\nsponte dismissal is appropriate when \u2018the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no\nfurther factual record is requited to be developed.\u201d Davis v. Gauby, 408 F. App\u2019x 524, 526 (3d Cir.\n2010) (quoting Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)). Here, Plaintiff complains of\nacts occutting prior to April 13, 2019. For example, he tefets to November 15, 2001 as the date that\ngives rise to his claims and to December 2006, when coutt rulings were entered. It is evident from\nthe face of the Complaint that all claims that accrued prior to April 13, 2019 are barred by the two\nyear limitations petiod.\n\nSecond, all Defendants ate immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The State\nhas immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, as does the Delawate Department of Justice, the\nDelaware Department of Correction, and the Delaware Department of State Police. See Anderson v.\nPhelps, 830 F. App\u2019x 397, 398 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Karns v. Shanahan, 879 F.3d 504, 513 3d Cit.\n2018)); Alston v. Administrative Offices of Delaware Courts, 178 F. Supp. 3d 222, 229 (D. Del.), aff'd, 663\nF. App\u2019x 105 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment protects states and their agencies from suit in federal court\nregatdless of the kind of telief sought. See Pennhurst State School \u00a2\u00bb Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n100 (1984). \u201cAbsent a state\u2019s consent, the Eleventh Amendment bars a civil tights suit in federal\ncourt that names the state as a defendant.\u201d Laskaris v. Thornburgh, 661 F.2d 23, 25 (3d Cir. 1981)\n(citing Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781 (1978)). Delaware has not waived its immunity from suit in\nfederal court; although Congress can abrogate a state\u2019s sovereign immunity, it did not do so through\n\n4\nthe enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Jones v. Sussex Corr. Inst., 725 F. App\u2019x 157, 159-160 (3d Cir.\n2017)); Brooks-McCollum v. Delaware, 213 F. App\u2019x 92, 94 (3d Cir. 2007). In addition, dismissal is\nproper because the State Defendants ate not petsons for purposes of \u00a7 1983. See Will v. Michigan\nDep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71(1989); Cathoun v. Young, 288 F. App\u2019x 47 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nThird, Plaintiff seeks release from prison. To the extent that Plaintiff attempts to challenge\nhis conviction and/or sentence, his sole fedetal remedy for challenging the fact or duration of his\nconfinement is by way of habeas corpus. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973); see also Torrence\n\u00bb. Thompson, 435 F. App\u2019x 56 (3d Cir. 2011). Furthermore, a plaintiff cannot recover under \u00a7 1983\nfor alleged wrongful incarceration unless he proves that the conviction or sentence has been\nreversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal\nauthorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal coutt\u2019s issuance of a writ\nof habeas corpus. See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487 (1994).\n\nIn Heck, the Supreme Court held that where success in a \u00a7 1983 action would implicitly call\ninto question the validity of conviction ot duration of sentence, the plaintiff must first achieve\nfavorable termination of his available state or federal habeas remedies to challenge the underlying\nconviction or sentence. \u201cA state prisonet\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is batted (absent prior invalidation) \u2014 no\nmatter the relief sought (damages ot equitable relief), no matter the target of the prisonet\u2019s suit (state\nconduct leading to conviction or internal prison proceedings) if success in that action would\nnecessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the confinement or its duration.\u201d Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544\nUS. 74, 81-82 (2005).\n\nHere, Plaintiff has not alleged ot proven that his conviction or sentence were reversed ot\n\ninvalidated, as required by Heck. To the extent Plaintiff seeks damages for his curtent incarceration,\nhis claim rests on an \u201cinatguable legal conclusion\u201d and is, therefore, frivolous. Neitzke, 490 U.S. at\n326.\n\nPlaintiff's claims are time-barred, raised against Defendants who are immune from suit, and\nfrivolous. The Complaint will be dismissed. The Court finds amendment futile.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint as time-batred, based upon\nDefendants\u2019 immunity from suit, and as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@ and (iit)\nand 1915A(b)(1) and (2). The Coutt finds amendment futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nHAYWARD M. EVANS,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ. No. 21-903-LPS\n\nDELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF\nJUSTICE, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this 13th day of June, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date,\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED as time-barred, based upon Defendants\u2019 Pearetie\nfrom suit, and as frivolous, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@ and (iii) and 1915A(b)(1) and\n(2). Amendment is futile.\n\n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.\n\nTeont P. doe\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n"}
