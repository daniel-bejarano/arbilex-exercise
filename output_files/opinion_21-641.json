Andrews", "date": "11-19-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nKENNETH E. WOOD, JR., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCONNECTIONS COMMUNITY \nSUPPORT PROGRAMS , INC., et al., \nDefendants . : Civil Action No. 21-641-RGA \nKenneth E. Wood, Jr., Sussex Correctional Institution , Georgetown , Delaware . \nPro Se Plaintiff. \nNovember 19, 2021 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION A~~ is rict Judge: \nPlaintiff Kenneth E. Wood, an inmate at Sussex Correctional Institution in \nGeorgetown , Delaware , filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 on May 3, 2021. \n(D.I. 2). Plaintiff appears prose and has been granted leave to proceed in forma \npauperis. (D.I. 4). Plaintiff moves for an order to convene a negligence panel. (D.I. \n10). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(8) \nand\u00a7 1915A(a). The motion will also be addressed. \nBACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). \nPlaintiff alleges deliberate indifference to serious medical needs in violation of the \nEighth Amendment and violations of his right to due process under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. (D. I. 2 at 10, 11 ). Plaintiff names two contract medical providers to the \nDelaware Department of Correction as defendants : Connections CSP and Centurion . \nCenturion became the contract medical provider on April 1, 2020. On August 12, 2021, \nConnections filed a suggestion of bankruptcy and this matter is stayed as to \nConnections and its employees Dr. Curtis Harris and Sheri L. McAfee-Garner pursuant \nto Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a). The case is not stayed \nas to McAfee-Garner for acts taken after April 1, 2020, when it appears she became \nemployed by Centurion . \n1 Plaintiff alleges his claims began in November 2018 and continued through \nMarch 4, 2021. (D.I. 3 at 4, 9). Plaintiffs claims concern nerve damage in his left foot \nand pain medication that was discontinued by medical personnel. (Id. at 4-7). \nIn early December 2019, Plaintiff was transferred to Alabama to resolve an open \ndetainer. (Id. at 7). While there medical staff placed him on Tramadol and increased \nLyrica to the amount he was originally prescribed . (Id.). When Plaintiff returned to SCI \non March 3, 2010, without being seen, he was taken off Tramadol and lidocaine \npatches. (Id.). Plaintiff submitted sick call slips to have the medications reinstated and \nwas told that he could not receive Tramadol \"per policy.\" (Id.). Plaintiff was told by the \nphysician that he knew Plaintiff was in extreme pain, but he could not help him. (Id.). \nPlaintiff submitted a grievance on March 7, 2020 to receive lidocaine patches. (Id.). In \nthe meantime , Plaintiff was prescribed cream for his condition. (Id.). Defendant Mike \nRecords denied Plaintiffs grievance because he had been prescribed the cream. (/d.). \nCenturion became the health care provider on April 1, 2020. On April 17, 2020, \nPlaintiff submitted a grievance and asked to be placed on Tramadol for pain until he \ncould have surgery. (Id. at 8). On May 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed separate appeals on his \ngrievances and requested a resolution of his medical issues, one of which included \nreceiving medication that had been discontinued . (Id.). One grievance was resolved \nand, as of April 1, 2021, Plaintiff had not received a final ruling from Records on the \nother grievance. (Id. at 8-9). \n2 On an unnamed date, Centurion filled a medical order for Plaintiff to receive new \nhigh-top shoes or boots, but with a pair of low-top sneakers . (Id. at 9). Plaintiff alleges \nthe sneakers were the only shoes that Centurion would provide and the shoes neither \nsupported or helped his foot or ankle problems . (Id.). On March 4, 2021, Garner took \nPlaintiff off a medication without seeing him when Plaintiff requested a refill of his \ncream. (Id.). Plaintiff did not have the needed cream for over a month until an outside \nmedical provider reordered the cream. (Id.). \nPlaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory \ndamages . \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or \nmalicious , fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary \nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant) . The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds prose, his pleading is liberally construed and his \n3 complaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94. \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless \" or \n\"fantastic or delusional\" factual scenario. \"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscherv. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. \n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim -----\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions. \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility . See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not \ndismissed , however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted. See id. at 11. \n4 A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations , assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlemen t to relief. Connelly v. Lane \nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\" Id. \nDISCUSSION \nStatute of Limitations . Plaintiff alleges that his claims began in November \n2018. He filed his complaint on April 26, 2021 as determined by the prisoner mailbox \nrule. See Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266 (1988); Burns v. Morton, 134 F.3d 109, 112 \n(3d Cir. 1998); Gibbs v. Decker, 234 F. Supp. 2d 458, 463 (D. Del. 2002); Rivers v. \nHorn, 2001 WL 312236, at *1 n.1 (E.D. Pa. March 29, 2001) (extending Houston to pro \nse prisoner\u00a7 1983 complaints) . \nFor purposes of the statute of limitations , \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as \npersonal injury actions. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985). In Delaware , \n\u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two-year limitations period. See 10 Del. Code\u00a7 8119; \nJohnson v. Cullen, 925 F. Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996). Section 1983 claims accrue \n5 \"when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which (his] action is \nbased.\" Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia , 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998). \nThe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that generally must be raised \nby the defendant, and it is waived if not properly raised. See Benak ex rel. Alliance \nPremier Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P., 435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir. \n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon, 807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986). \"Although \nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua sponte dismissal is appropriate \nwhen 'the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual \nrecord is required to be developed. \"' Davis v. Gauby, 408 F. App'x 524, 526 (3d Cir. \n2010) (quoting Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)). Hence, a court \nmay dismiss a time-barred complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). \nPlaintiff complains of acts occurring beginning in November 2018 when \nConnections was the medical contract health care provider. Centurion became the \ncontract health care provider on April 1, 2020. Plaintiff did not file his Complaint until \nApril 26, 2021. It is evident from the face of the Complaint that all claims that accrued \nprior to April 26, 2019 raised against any named defendant are barred by the two year \nlimitations period. Therefore , all claims that accrued prior to April 26, 2019 will be \ndismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1 ). \nRespondeat Superior . Plaintiff has named Commissioner Claire DeMatteis as a \ndefendant but the Complaint contains no factual allegations against her. He alleges that \nDeMatteis failed to fulfill her duties and responsibilities as Commissioner . (D.I. 2 at 11 ). \n6 He also alleges in a conclusory manner that she did not provide for proper training of \nthe SCI medical department and did not maintain a proper contract to provide adequate \nmedical care. (Id.). \nIn reading the allegations , it is clear that DeMatteis has been named as a \ndefendant based upon her supervisory position. There is no respondeat superior \nliability under\u00a7 1983. See Parke/Iv. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016). A \ndefendant in a civil rights action is not responsible for constitutional violations that she \ndid not participate in or which she did not approve. Baraka v. McGreevey, 481 F.3d \n187,210 (3d Cir. 2007); see also Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 325, (1981) \n(holding that liability in a \u00a7 1983 action must be based on personal involvement , not \nrespondeat superior) . Such involvement may be \"shown through allegations of personal \ndirection or of actual knowledge and acquiescence .\" Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, \n353 (3d Cir. 2005). In addition, a non-medical prison official must either actually know, \nor have reason to believe, that prison doctors are mistreating or not treating the prisoner \nto be liable for deliberate indifference. Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 236 (3d Cir. 2004). \nPlaintiff does not allege that DeMatteis participated in or approved of any alleged \nwrongdoing. Nor are there allegations that DeMatteis either actually knew, or had \nreason to believe, that Plaintiff was being mistreated in any way by prison staff. As \npied, the complaint fails to state a facially plausible claim against DeMatteis and the \nclaim will be dismissed . The Court find amendment futile as to this claim. \n7 Grievances. Plaintiff alleges that Records violated his right to due process and \naccess to the courts when he withheld ruling on grievances and caused Plaintiff to wait \nseveral months to file this action. (D. I. 2 at 11 ). Plaintiff takes exception to the \ngrievance process. \nThe filing of prison grievances is a constitutionally protected activity. Robinson v. \nTaylor, 204 F. App'x 155, 157 (3d Cir. 2006). To the extent that Plaintiff bases his \nclaims upon his dissatisfaction with the grievance procedure or denial of his grievances , \nthe claims fail because an inmate does not have a \"free-standing constitutional right to \nan effective grievance process.\" Woods v. First Corr. Med., Inc., 446 F. App'x 400, 403 \n(3d Cir. 2011) (citing Flick v. Alba, 932 F.2d 728, 729 (8th Cir. 1991 )). Notably, the \ndenial of grievance appeals does not in itself give rise to a constitutional claim as \nPlaintiff is free to bring a civil rights claim in District Court. Winn v. Department Of Corr., \n340 F. App'x 757, 759 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing Flick v. Alba, 932 F.2d at 729). \nPlaintiff cannot maintain a constitutional claim based upon his perception that his \ngrievances were not properly processed , that they were denied, or that the grievance \nprocess is inadequate. Therefore , the Court will dismiss the claims against Records as \nfrivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1 ). Amendment is futile \nas to the claims raised against him. \nMedical. At this juncture, Plaintiff has alleged what appear to be cognizable and \nnon-frivolous claims against Garner (as a Centurion employee) and Centurion. He may \nproceed with the medical claims. \n8 Medical Negligence Panel. Plaintiff asks the court to convene a medical \nnegligence review panel as proscribed under 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6814 on the grounds that he \nplans on filing an amended complaint that will raise negligence claims that relate to the \noriginal alleged actions. (0.1. 10). \nPursuant to Delaware Superior Court Civil Rule of Procedure Rule 71.2(b), \"a \nparty may file a demand to convene a malpractice review panel at any time subsequent \nto entry of appearance by all defendants who have been served and after a reasonable \ntime for discovery unless otherwise stipulated to by the parties or ordered by the Court.\" \nDel. Sup. Ct. Civ. R. Proc. 71.2(b). Section 6853(e) of the Delaware Health Care \nNegligence Insurance and Litigation Act provides in pertinent part: \nNo liability shall be based upon asserted negligence unless expert medical \ntestimony is presented as to the alleged deviation from the applicable \nstandard of care in the specific circumstances of the case and as to the \ncausation of the alleged personal injury or death, except that such expert \nmedical testimony shall not be required if a medical negligence review \npanel has found negligence to have occurred and to have caused the \nalleged personal injury or death and the opinion of such panel is admitted \ninto evidence .... \n18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853(e). The Delaware Superior Court reads\u00a7 6853(e) and Rule 71.2 \ntogether, and is satisfied that, where a timely demand to convene a medical malpractice \nreview panel has been filed, no affidavit of merit is required under Section 6853. See \nMiller v. Taylor, 2010 WL 3386580 , at *2 (Del. Super .Aug. 19, 2010). \nSection 6814 of the Delaware Health Care Negligence Insurance and Litigation \nAct provides that the Delaware Insurance Commissioner shall convene a medical \nnegligence review panel at the request of a Federal District Court Judge sitting in a civil \n9 action in the District of Delaware alleging medical negligence in the manner instructed \nby the said federal court, but also in a manner as consistent as possible with the \nprocess of selecting such panels provided for in Superior Court actions. See 18 Del. C. \n\u00a7 6814. The caveat to this section, however, is that the Insurance Commissioner shall \nnot convene any such panels at the request of any such federal court \"unless provisions \nare made for the payment of the compensation and expenses of such panelists and the \ncompensation and expenses of all witnesses called by such panel out of the funds other \nthan those of the General Fund of the State.\" Id. \nThe Court lacks authority to appoint a medical review panel for Plaintiff at the \npublic's expense. See, e.g., Boring v. Kozakiewicz , 833 F.2d 468,474 (3d Cir. 1987) \n(\"Congress has authorized the courts to waive prepayment of such items as filing fees \nand transcripts if a party qualifies to proceed in forma pauperis. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. \nHowever , we have been directed to no statutory authority nor to any appropriation to \nwhich the courts may look for payment of expert witness fees in civil suits for damages . \nProvisions have been made for expert witness fees in criminal cases, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3006A(e)(1) , but not in civil damage suits.\"). Nor has Plaintiff, who has been granted \nin forma pauperis status, indicated that he has the financial means for compensation \nand expenses of the medical review panel. Therefore , the Court will deny without \nprejudice the motion to convene a medical negligence review panel. The Court will \n10 reconsider the request upon a showing by Plaintiff of his financial ability to pay the \ncompensation and expenses of the medical review panel.1 \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny without prejudice Plaintiffs \nmotion to convene a negligence panel (0.1. 1 0); (2) dismiss all claims that accrued prior \nto April 26, 2019 as time-barred and dismiss Defendants Claire DeMatteis and Mike \nRecords and the claims against them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and \n\u00a7 1915A(b)(1 ); and (3) allow Plaintiff to proceed against Sheri L. McAfee-Garner (as a \nCenturion employee) and Centurion . \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n1 I note that Judges Sleet and Stark of this Court have followed this exact same line of \nreasoning before. Indeed, they are the only judges who have ever cited Miller v. Taylor. \nIn particular , no state court judge has ever cited the case. I am not entirely convinced \nthat I agree with Miller v. Taylor, and I am not bound by a Superior Court decision, but, \nunder the circumstances , I do not have to give my doubts more thorough thought. \n11 "}
