(D.I. 7.)  I held a hearing on the motion on \nFebruary 8, 2022.  (Tr. __.)  As announced from the bench on February 9, 2022, HubSpot\u2019 s motion \nis DENIED  without prejudice to HubSpot\u2019s ability to raise its 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 and standing \narguments at the summary judgment stage.   \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201c factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged. \u201d  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.  \u201cWhere \na complaint pleads facts that are \u2018 merely consistent with \u2019 a defendant \u2019s liability, it \u2018 stops short of \nthe line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief. \u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 557).   \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint, I must assume all \u201cwell-pleaded facts \u201d are \ntrue but need not assume the truth of legal conclusions.  Id.  at 679.  \u201c [W]hen the allegations i n a \ncomplaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency \nshould be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n3 \n B. Patent Eligibility Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 \nSection 101 defines the categories of subject matter that are patent eligible.  It provides: \n\u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition \nof matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the \nconditions and requirements of this title.\u201d   35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  The Supreme Court has recognized \nthree exceptions to the broad statutory categories of patent -eligible subject matter: \u201claws of nature, \nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas \u201d are not patent -eligible.  Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175, \n185 (1981).  \u201cWhether a claim recites patent -eligible subject matter is a question of law which may \ncontain di sputes over underlying facts.\u201d   Berkheimer v. HP Inc. , 881 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. \n2018). \nThe Supreme Court has established a two -step test for determining whether patent claims \nare invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int \u2019l, 573 U.S. 208 (2014).  In step \none, the court must \u201c determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent -ineligible \nconcept.\u201d   Id. at 218. This first step requires the court to \u201cexamine the \u2018 focus \u2019 of the claim, i.e., its \n\u2018character as a whole, \u2019 in order to determine whether the claim is directed to \u201d an ineligible concept.   \nEpic IP LLC v. Backblaze, Inc., 351 F. Supp. 3d 733, 736 (D. Del. 2018) (Bryson, J.) (quoting SAP \nAm., Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC , 898 F.3d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Internet P ats. Corp. v. Active \nNetwork, Inc. , 790 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2015)).  \nBecause \u201call inventions  . . . embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural \nphenomena, or abstract ideas, \u201d Mayo Collaborative Services  v. Prometheus Laboratories , Inc. , \n566 U.S. 66, 71 (2012), \u201c courts \u2018must be careful to avoid oversimplifying the claims \u2019 by looking \nat them generally and failing to account for the specific requirements of the claims. \u201d  McRO v. \nBandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2016)  (quoting In re TLI \nCommc \u2019ns LLC Pat. Litig., 823 F.3d 607, 611 (Fed. Cir. 2016)) ; see also  Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft 4 \n Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2016)  (\u201c[D]escribing the claims at [too] high [a] level of \nabstraction and untethered from the language of the claims all but ensures that the exceptions to \n\u00a7 101 swallow the rule. \u201d).  \u201cAt step one, therefore, it is not enough to merely identify a patent -\nineligible concept underlying the claim; [the court] must determine whether that patent- ineligible \nconcept is what the claim is \u2018 directed to. \u2019\u201d Rapid Litig. Mgmt. Ltd. v. CellzDirect, Inc., 827 F.3d \n1042, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2016). If the claims are not directed to a patent -ineligible concept, the n the  \nclaims are patent -eligible under  \u00a7 101 and the analysis is over .  If, however, the claims are directed \nto a patent -ineligible concept, the n the  analysis proceeds to step two . \nAt step two, the court  \u201cconsider[s] the elements of each claim both individually and as an \nordered combination \u201d to determine if there is an \u201c inventive concept \u2014i.e., an element or \ncombination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself. \u201d Alice , 573 U .S. at 217\u201318 \n(internal quotations and citations omitted).   \u201cIt is well -settled that mere recitation of concrete, \ntangible components is insufficient to confer patent eligibility to an otherwise abstract idea. \u201d  TLI \nCommc \u2019ns, 823 F.3d at  613. Thus, \u201c [m]ere ly reciting the use of a generic computer or adding the \nwords \u2018apply it with a computer \u2019\u201d does not transform a patent -ineligible concept into patent \neligible subject matter.  Two-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast Cable Commc \u2019ns, LLC , 874 F.3d 1329, \n1338 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting Alice , 573 U.S. at 223).  Nor is there an inventive concept when \nthe claims \u201c [s]imply append[] conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality\u201d  to a \npatent -ineligible concept.   Alice , 573 U.S. at 222. \nConversely, claims pass muster at step two when they \u201cinvolve more than performance of \nwell-understood, routine, and conventional activities previously known to the industry. \u201d  \nBerkheimer, 881 F.3d at 1367 (citation and internal marks omitted).  \u201cThe mere fact that something 5 \n is disclosed in a piece of prior art . . . does not mean it was well -understood, routine, and \nconventional.\u201d   Id. at 1369.  Moreover, \u201can inventive concept can be found in the non- conventional \nand non- generic arrangement of known, conve ntional pieces. \u201d  Bascom Glob. Internet Servs., Inc. \nv. AT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  Whether an activity was  well-\nunderstood, routine , or conventional to a person of ordinary skill in the art  is a question of fact.   \nBerkheimer, 881 F.3d at 1368. \nC. Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing  \nArticle III of the Constitution limits the federal judicial power to deciding \u201cCases\u201d and \n\u201cControversies.\u201d   To possess Article III standing , a plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in \nfact, which is an invasion of a legally protected interest that  is concrete and particularized and \nactual or imminent rather than conjectural or hypothetical, (2) that is fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant , and (3) is likely to be  redressed by a favorable judicial decision .  \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) ; Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest \nLabs ., Inc., 527 F.3d 1278, 1291 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ; Storino v. Borough of Point Pleasant Beach , \n322 F.3d 293, 296 (3d Cir. 2003).  \u201cT he actual or threatened injury required by Art. III may exist \nsolely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing.\u201d   Warth v. \nSeldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975) ; Lone Star Silicon Innovations LLC v. N anya Tech. Corp., 925 \nF.3d 1225, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 2019); In re Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer Priv. Litig., 806 \nF.3d 125, 134 (3d Cir. 2015) .  At the pleading stage, \u201cgeneral factual allegations of injury resulting \nfrom the defendant\u2019s conduct may su ffice\u201d to defeat a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; Warth , 422 U.S. at 501 (\u201cFor purposes of ruling on a motion \nto dismiss for want of standing, both the trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations  of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\u201d) ; \nLone Star , 925 F .3d at 1234\u201335.     6 \n In contrast to constitutional standing, the question of so -called \u201cstatutory standing\u201d\u2014that \nis, whether a party may sue under a particular federal statute \u2014does not implicate a court\u2019s subject \nmatter jurisdiction.  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v.  Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 128 n.4; \nLone Star , 925 F.3d at 1234\u201336 (holding that a plaintiff had Article III standing to sue for patent \ninfringement even though it did not possess all substantial rights in the patent) .  Of course, to s tate \na claim for the violation of a substantive  statute, a  plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to give  rise \nto a plausible inference that the statute confers a right of action on them. But a plaintiff\u2019s failure \nto do so is not an issue of standing or subject matter jurisdiction and, thus, it is more appropriately challenged under Rule 12(b)(6), applying the standards outlined above.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 125\u2013\n28, 137\u201340 (affirming denial of motion to dismiss where the complaint\u2019s  allegations, taken as true, \nput the plaintiff within the class of plaintiffs whom Congress authorized to sue under a substantive statute); Lone Star , 925 F.3d at  1235\u2013 1236 (\u201c[F] ollowing Lexmar k, several courts have concluded \nthat motions to dismiss based on \u2018 statutory standing \u2019 defects are properly brought under Rule \n12(b)(6) rather than Rule 12(b)(1) in recognition of the fact that such defects are not jurisdictional. . . . We therefore firmly bring ourselves into accord with Lexmark and our sister circuits by \nconcluding that whether a party possesses all substantial rights in a patent does not implicate standing or subject -matter jurisdiction. \u201d).  \nII. DISCUSSION  \nThe decision of the Court was announced from the bench on February 9, 2022, as follows:  \nThis is the Court \u2019s ruling on HubSpot \u2019s motion to dismiss \nfor failure to state a claim and lack of standing.  I will summarize \nthe reasons for the Court \u2019s ruling in a moment.   But before I do, I \nwant to be clear that my failure to  address a particular argument \nadvanced by a party does not mean that I did not consider it. We have carefully considered the Complaint and attached exhibits, the parties\u2019  briefs and exhibits, and the arguments made at yesterday \u2019s 7 \n hearing.1  We will not be issuing a separate opinion, but we will \nissue a written document incorporating the ruling that I am about to \nmake.  \n  \nFor the following reasons, HubSpot \u2019s motion is  DENIE D \nwithout prejudice to its ability to reraise the issues of \u00a7 101 \neligibility and standing at a later stage in the case.  \n  \n[U.S. Patent No. 6,236,977]  was issued on May 22, 2001,  \nand it is now expired.  It claims systems for \u201c computer -implemented \nself-optimizing marketing\u201d  using organized data storage and \noptimization software.   \n  \nOn March 19, 2021, Trident Holdings, Inc., filed a \nComplaint against HubSpot, Inc. alleging infringement of the \u2019 977 \npatent .2  The Complaint alleges that \u201cTrident owns all rights to the \n\u2019977 patent via an Assignment to Real Living, Inc.,\u201d  which later \n\u201cchanged its name to Trident Holdings, Inc.\u201d3  The Complaint \nalleges that HubSpot infringed \u201c at least claims 1, 4, 27, and 30\u201d  \nthrough commercial use of its Sales Hub software.4    \n  \nOn June 14, 2021, HubSpot filed a motion to dismiss under \nRules 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1).5  HubSpot argues that the \u2019 977 patent  \nis invalid under \u00a7 101 because its claims are directed to ineligible \nsubject matter.  HubSpot also argues that Trident hasn\u2019 t shown that \nit has an ownership interest in the \u2019 977 patent  sufficient to confer \nstanding.  The parties have consented to have the motion decided by a Magistrate Judge.\n6  The Court heard oral argument yesterday, \nFebruary 8, 2022. . . . .  \n The \u2019977 patent  has 53 claims. The Complaint alleges that \nHubSpot infringes \u201c at least \u201d claims 1, 4, 27, and 30.  The briefing \nsuggested a threshold dispute  about whether it is appropriate to treat \n \n1 (D.I. 1, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15.)  \n2 (D.I. 1.)   \n3 (Id. \u00b6 7.)   \n4 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11 \u201313.)  \n5 (D.I. 7.)   \n6 (D.I. 17.)   8 \n claims 1 and 4 as representative of all 53 claims.  Because HubSpot \ncontends that independent claim 1 and [dependent claim] 4 are unpatentable, and because I reject HubSpot \u2019s arguments at least as \nto claim 1, HubSpot \u2019s motion should be denied , and the Court need \nnot consider the remaining claims at this stage.  \n  \nThe Court will now proceed to dance the Alice  two step.  The \nCourt is directed at step 1 to examine the focus of the claim to determine whether the claim is directed to a patent- ineligible \nconcept.  [Claim 1 reads as follows:  \n  \n1.  A computer -implemented s elf-optimizing \nmarketing system comprising:  \n[a] a campaign engine for selectively generating and \nstoring a campaign population, said campaign population having members comprising stored first data representing a plurality of marketing campaigns each campa ign characterized by a plurality of \ncampaign attributes including a plurality of campaign activities;  \n[b] said campaign engine having processing \nfunctionality to assemble campaign population members from said campaign \nactivities;   \n[c] a customer population data store for storing a \ncustomer population, said customer population having members comprising stored second data representing a plurality of customers and potential customers, characterized by a plurality of customer attributes; and   \n[d] an optimizatio n engine for accessing said first \nand second data to optimize at least one of said campaign population and said customer population,  \n[e] said optimization engine including a scoring \nsystem for ordering the members of at least one of said campaign populati on and said \ncustomer population, said scoring system employing adaptive scoring process that alters said scoring process based upon relations among at least some of said campaign attributes and said customer attributes.  \n  9 \n Claim 4 reads as follows:  \n \n4. The system of claim 1 wherein said campaign \nengine includes prediction engine and \noptimization engine.]  \n  \nHubSpot \u2019s opening brief did not set forth a definitive \narticulation as to what it contends is the abstract idea:   it said that \nthe claims \u201care directed at an abstract idea related to identifying, \nanalyzing, and displaying data \u201d and that the claims \u201c could be broken \ndown into . . . [t]he steps of collecting, storing, and retrieving data.\u201d7  \nHubSpot \u2019s reply brief stated that the claims \u201c are directed to the \nabstract idea of identifying, analyzing and displaying information.\u201d8  \nI cannot disagree with HubSpot that the first three limitations \u2014[a], \n[b], and [c] \u2014appear  to be nothing more than storing and organizing \ninformation in conventional ways.  However, the last two limitations \u2014[d] and [e] \u2014incorporate the concept of optimization \nbased on an adaptive scoring system.  \n  \nTrident suggested for the first time at oral argument that the \n\u201coptimization engine \u201d and \u201cadaptive scoring \u201d limitations required \nconstruction before the Court decides eligibility.\n9  That claim \nconstruction wasn\u2019 t expressly raised until the oral argument \nsuggests that [Trident]  may not have actually thought there was a \nclaim construction is sue that had to be addressed before resolving \nthe \u00a7 101 motion. That said, although Trident did not frame this as \nan issue of claim construction in its brief, Trident did argue that an understanding of the scope of the claims is a factual issue that should  \nbe resolved first.  I \u2019m not sure that the off -the-cuff proposed \nconstructions that Trident provided at the hearing\n10 accurately \ncapture the claims\u2014or incorporate concrete rules that might make \nthe claims patent eligible \u2014but , as Trident points out, the \nspecification discloses potentially concrete or unconventional methods of adaptive scoring.\n11   \n   \n \n7 (D.I. 8 at 1, 8.)  \n8 (D.I. 15 at 3.)    \n9 (Tr. 21:17\u2013 22:24, 24:2\u2013 10.) \n \n10 (Tr. 24:13\u2013 16, 24:25\u201325:1.)  \n \n11 E.g., \u2019 977 patent , cols. 3 \u20134, 6, 7\u20138, 13\u201314. 10 \n Trident correctly points out that on this posture \u2014a motion \nto dismiss under Rule 12\u2014I must draw all inferences in Trident \u2019s \nfavor.  And, unless the Court construes the claims, the C ourt must \nalso draw inferences related to claim construction in Trident \u2019s \nfavor.12  I\u2019m not prepared to construe the claims at this stage of the \ncase and on this record.  The record is insufficient here to [adopt  \neven]  a preliminary claim construction that would decide this issue, \nand I draw the reasonable inference that the \u201coptimization e ngine \u201d \nand \u201cadaptive scoring \u201d limitations might capture a specific genus of \nalgorithms or types of rules.13    \n  \nAt this stage of the case, and without the benefit of claim \nconstruction, I am not persuaded that HubSpot \u2019s articulation of the \nabstract idea satisfactorily takes into account the optimization and \nadaptive scoring elements.  Rather, I fear that HubSpot may have done what the Federal Circuit has cautioned against :  its proposed \ndescription of the claims is at too high a level of abs traction and \nuntethered from the language of the claims.\n14  Under these \ncircumstances, it is appropriate to deny HubSpot \u2019s motion to \ndismiss.15 \n  \n \n12 Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1125 (Fed. Cir. \n2018)  (\u201c[P]atent eligibility can be determined at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage . . . only when there are \nno factual allegations that, taken as true, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.\u201d) ; see also Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 332 (2015) (claim \nconstruction may depend on underlying issues of fact).   \n \n13 See McRO , 837 F.3d at 1313 (claimed software  patent eligible when construction \ndemonstrated claimed rules limited to  a particular  \u201cgenus \u201d or type of unconventional rules).   \n \n14 Id. at  1313.   \n \n15 Courts in this district regularly deny motions to dismiss based on patent ineligibility \nunder  \u00a7 101 when  the defendant\u2019s proffered  abstract idea fails  to satisfactorily capture the \nsubstance of the claims.

Jam City, Inc., No. 18 -1331, 2019 WL 351254, at *3 (D. \nDel. Jan. 29, 2019). 11 \n That said, I make a couple of observations.  Even though the \nclaims describe themselves as \u201c systems, \u201d I don \u2019t think that anyone \nhere disputes that both the claims and the specification of the \u2019977 \npatent describe software packages that could run on any ge neric \ncomputer (and perhaps a generic telecommunication \ninfrastructure).16  Assessing whether software is an ab stract idea or \na concrete invention is always a particular challenge because, by its \nnature, software is designed to be executed on a generic computer.   \n \nThe case law acknowledges that computers can inherently \nexecute numerical tasks faster, with fewer er rors, and without \ncontinuous human control, but those benefits alone do not make \nbroadly- claimed software ideas patentable.   Indeed, it is now clear \nthat claims directed to performing well- known economic practices \non a generic computer are not patent eligi ble.17  While claims \ndirected to improving the functionality of a computer may not be abstract,\n18 I agree with HubSpot that these claims don\u2019 t concern \nimproving the functionality of a computer.  \n  \nBut that is not the end of the Alice  inquiry, because software \ncan be patent eligible because of what it does and how.  The McRO \ncase, for example, teaches us that software that automates identified tasks that could be performed manually is patent -eligible  if the claim \nimproves the process beyond the generic benefits obtained using a computer.\n19  Here, Trident argues that their claimed software does \nexactly that:  it improves its efficiency over time without human trial \nand error.   \n  \nHubSpot points out tha t the McR O case is distinguishable \nbecause the claims at issue there involved specific rules.  I take its  \npoint , and I agree that, to the extent that the claims here are directed \nto the broad concept of self -improvement or self- optimization of \nmarketing ca mpaigns without any specific rules, they may very well \nbe directed to an abstract idea.   Indeed, I don \u2019t think anyone here \nwould seriously dispute that, as long as they\u2019 ve been around, \nmarketers have always tried to conserve their efforts and improve their own campaigns.

Nor would restricting the concept of self -optimization to \nthe field of digital marketing be enough to render abstract claims \nnon-abstract.20   \n   \nHere, however, the limitations directed to optimization may \nclaim something more narrow than the abstract idea of self-improvement.  I think there are three -prongs to the thrust of \nTrident \u2019s argument .  T he claims require (1) an \u201coptimization \nengine,\u201d  (2) the \u201cadaptive scoring \u201d of campaigns or customers, and \n(3) a \u201cprediction engine \u201d for scoring.  The eligibility of the claims \nmay depend on whether the claimed use of each term is a particular genus of rules or a generic description of automated self -\nimprovement.  The answer to that question depends on claim construction, and the Court  is not prepared to do that at this stage of \nthe case on this briefing.  \n  \nIn short, I cannot say on this record that the claims of the \n\u2019977 patent  are directed to an abstract idea.  HubSpot \u2019s motion is \ntherefore denied.  HubSpot may reraise its \u00a7 101 argum ents at a later \nstage in the case.     \nBecause the Court cannot conclude that the claims of the \nchallenged patent are directed to an abstract idea, the Court does not proceed to Alice step two.  I do note, however, that the question of \nwhether the claims i nvolve \u201cmore than performance of \u2018 well-\nunderstood, routine, [and] conventional activities \u2019\u201d\n21 cannot be \nanswered without understanding what the claims cover.  And \nanswering the question may also involve assessing disputed issues of fact.\n22   \n Trident disputes that the claims involve nothing more than \nconventional activities. And the record does not conclusively \ndemonstrate that the claims involve only conventional activities.  So even if I were to conclude that all of the claims at issue were directed to an  abstract idea, I cannot say on this record that the claims fail at \n \n20 Alice , 573 U.S. at  222\u201323 ( \u201c[T]he prohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be \ncircumvented by attempting to limit the use of [the idea] to a particular technological environment.\u201d  (quoting Bilski, 561 U.S. at 610\u201311) ). \n \n21 Id. at  225 (quoting May o, 566 U.S. at 80).  \n \n22 Berkheimer , 881 F.3d at 1368 (what \u201cis well -understood, routine, and conventional to a \nskilled artisan\u201d within the meaning of Alice  \u201cis a question of fact\u201d).   \n 13 \n step two.  Should this be a situation where HubSpot thinks that early \nclaim construction and summary judgment proceedings on the issues of \u00a7 101 might be appropriate, it  may raise that with the \npresiding judge.    \n   HubSpot alternatively argues that this case should be \ndismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing.  I disagree.  An assignee of the \u2019 977 patent would have standing to bring this \naction.\n23  Moreover, for the purpose of assessing  standing  at this \nstage, the Court must accept as true the allegations set forth in the Complaint.   Here the Complaint alleges that Trident is the assignee \nof the \u2019 977 patent.  The Court must accept that as true at this stage.\n24   \n  The Abstract of Title does raise some questions, but I do not \ndecide whether the facts show that the \u2019 977 patent  is assigned to \nTrident.  Now is not the time to answer factual questions.  Although Trident ultimately bears the burden of demonstrating that it has standing to assert the patent, it does not need to prove any facts on this motion to dismiss.   \n  HubSpot argues that, even accepting Trident is the assignee, \nit may lack standing because the Abstract of Title shows a grant of \na security interest, and HubSpot hypothesizes that the security interest might have interrupted Trident \u2019s standing.  Even if that were \ncorrect in theory, there is only circumstantial evidence that the \nparties who granted the interest ever had any rights to the \u2019 977 \n \n23 Unlike the judicially -recognized  right of an exclusive patent licensee to sue for \ninfringement, an assignee\u2019s right  to su e for infringement is created by statute.  Rite -Hite Corp v. \nKelley Co. , 56 F.3d 1538, 1551 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc).  Section 281 of Title 35 gives \n\u201cpatentees\u201d the right to sue for infringement, and \u00a7 100(d) defines \u201cpatentee\u201d to include the original \npatentee and its successors in title.  Sections 154(a)(1) and 261 allow patents to be assigned and \nmake an assignee the successor \u201cpatentee\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 281.  See, e.g., Abbott Point of \nCare Inc. v. Epocal, Inc., 666 F.3d 1299, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2012)  (\u201c[A] patentee or successor in title \nto the patentee may bring an action for patent infringement.\u201d).   \n \n24 See Warth , 422 U.S. at 501; Storino 322 F.3d at  296; Ortho Pharm. Corp. v. Genetics \nInst., Inc., 52 F.3d 1026,  1032\u201333 (Fed. Cir. 1995) .  There is a conspicuous typographical error in \nthe Complaint, which erroneously identifies the document recorded with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at Reel/Frame 044346/0080 on February 4, 2015 as the instrument that grants sole t itle to Trident.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6 7.)  It appears undisputed that the recorded assignment to Real \nLiving, Inc. (which later changed its name to Trident) is at Reel/Frame 021561/0946 on September 17, 2008.  (D.I. 9, Ex. 2 ; Tr. 18:15\u2013 22.)  Trident\u2019s counsel indica ted during oral argument that it \nwould be \u201chappy\u201d to amend the complaint to correct the error.  (Tr. 29: 14\u201317.)    \nThe Court is nevertheless obliged at this stage of the proceedings to accept as true Trident\u2019s \nallegation  that it is  the assignee of the \u2019 977 patent.   14 \n patent , the interest does not appear to grant substantial rights in the \npatent, and the same public records HubSpot rel ies on indicate that \nthe security interest was released unexercised.25     \n  \nThe cases HubSpot cites, Ortho Pharmaceutical26 and \nAbbott Point of Care ,27 do not support dismissal here. HubSpot has \ncited no case holding that the mere grant of a security interest can \ndeprive an assignee of standing, and,  as mentioned, the court at this \nstage must accept as true that Trident is the assignee of the \u2019 977 \npatent . \n  \nAccordingly, HubSpot \u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of \nstanding is denied.   \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated  above, Defendant HubSpot\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied.  The \nCourt\u2019s decision is without prejudice to HubSpot\u2019s ability to reraise its  standing and \u00a7 101 \narguments at a later stage of the case.   \n \n25 (D.I. 9, Ex. 2; Tr. 29:18 \u201320.)  \n26 52 F.3d at 1032\u201333. \n \n27 666 F.3d at 1302.
