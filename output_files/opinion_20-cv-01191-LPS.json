(\u201cAgoda\u201d)\n(collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) for an alleged violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\n(\u201cCFAA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030 et seg. Defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to the doctrine of\nforum non conveniens and also because Ryanair\u2019s claim purportedly involves an impermissibly\nextraterritorial application of the CFAA. For the reasons explained below, the Court will deny\nDefendants\u2019 motion.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nRyanair is an Irish company with a principal place of business in Dublin, Ireland. (D.L. 1\n(\u201cCompl.\u201d) 41) It is \u201cEurope\u2019s first and largest low-fare airline.\u201d (Id. 31) Ryanair offers\nflights within Europe and North Africa, but not within or to the United States. (D.I. 19-1 Ex. 4\nat 26)\n\nBooking Holdings is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in\nNorwalk, Connecticut. (Compl. \u00a74) The other four defendants are subsidiaries of Booking\nHoldings:\n\n\u00a2 Booking.com is a Dutch company with a principal place of business in\nAmsterdam. (Jd. {\u00a7 5-6)\n\ne KAYAK is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in\nStamford, Connecticut. (Ud. \u00a7 7-8)\n\ne Priceline is a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of\nbusiness in Norwalk, Connecticut. (/d. J] 9-10) It shares the same business\naddress with Booking Holdings. (Compare id. \u00a7 9 with id. \u00a7 4)\n\ne Agoda is a Singaporean private limited company with a principal place of\n\n1\n\nbusiness in Singapore. (/d. ff 11-12)\nRyanair describes Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline, and Agoda as online travel agencies that\n\u201callow their customers to make and book travel arrangements,\u201d including the purchase of airline\ntickets. (Id. 713)!\n\nThe vast majority of Ryanair tickets are sold on Ryanair\u2019s website. (See id. {{] 34-36)\nAccording to Ryanair, by accessing its website, users agree to be bound by the website\u2019s Terms\nof Use. (Id. {9 41, 51-57; see also D.I. 1-1) The Terms of Use state that they are governed by\nIrish law. (D.I. 1-149) In the Terms of Use, Ryanair purportedly retains the exclusive ability\nto distribute tickets for all Ryanair flights. (Compl. { 42; see also D.J. 1-1 2) (\u201cThis website is\nthe only website authorised to sell Ryanair Group flights . .. whether on their own or together\nwith any other services.\u201d) The Terms of Use prohibit any user of the Ryanair website from\nexploiting the website for any commercial purposes. (Compl. {{] 43-44) In particular, the\nTerms of Use proscribe the \u201c[u]se of any automated system or software, whether operated by a\nthird party or otherwise, to extract any data\u201d from the Ryanair website, which is known as\n\u201cscreen scraping.\u201d (Jd. 44; D.I. 1-143) Consistent with the Terms of Use, a third party may\nenter into a separate license agreement with Ryanair to access information about Ryanair flights\nand to use that information for the purpose of price comparison. (Compl. 45; see also D.I. 1-1\n12)\n\nRyanair alleges that Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline, and Agoda allow travelers to\n\n! In Defendants\u2019 view, KAYAK is different from Booking.com, Priceline, and Agoda\nbecause KAYAK is a \u201cmetasearch engine.\u201d (D.I. 23 \u00a7\u00a7 8-9) According to Defendants,\nKAYAK does not sell airline tickets directly to consumers. (/d.) The Complaint does not\nmake this distinction and, at this stage, the Court must accept the Complaint\u2019s well-pled factual\nallegations as true.\npurchase tickets for Ryanair flights on their websites without transferring travelers to Ryanair\u2019s\nwebsite. (Compl.975) Ryanair also alleges that Defendants directly or indirectly procure\ninformation necessary to facilitate sales of Ryanair tickets \u201cfrom an automated system or\nsoftware that enables them to enter into and use the Ryanair Website\u201d on a \u201cdaily and near-\ncontinuous basis.\u201d (Jd. J\u00a7 74, 76) In other words, Ryanair accuses Defendants of constantly\nscreen scraping the Ryanair website. (Jd. 177-80)? Moreover, Ryanair contends that the\nprices for Ryanair flights shown on the Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline, and Agoda websites\nare higher than the prices for the same flights on Ryanair\u2019s own website. (/d. {{] 81-85) In\nRyanair\u2019s view, the inflated prices on Defendants\u2019 websites harm Ryanair\u2019s reputation and\ndiscourage travelers from flying with Ryanair. (Jd. {ff 86, 91)\n\nIn November 2019, Ryanair sent Booking.com a cease-and-desist letter to demand that\nBooking.com stop its screen scraping. (Jd. $100) In July 2020, Ryanair sent a second cease-\nand-desist letter to Booking.com\u2019s parent company, Booking Holdings. (/d.\u00a7 101) Overall,\nRyanair has spent over $5,000 in an attempt to block Defendants from accessing Ryanair\u2019s\nwebsite. (Id. | 94)\n\nDefendants deny engaging in any misconduct. In particular, Defendants contend that\nany screen scraping of the Ryanair website has been and continues to be performed not by them,\n\nbut by three foreign third-party ticket aggregators: Etraveli, Mystifly, and Travelfusion.? (D.L.\n\n? Ryanair notes that Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline, and Agoda prohibit screen\nscraping of their own websites. (Compl. ff 114-18)\n\n3 Travelfusion\u2019s website acknowledges that Travelfusion uses screen scraping to obtain\ninformation about Ryanair flights. (See D.I. 19-1 Ex. 6 at 1, 4)\n17 at 3-4) (citing DI. 20 9 17; D.L. 21 49 12-13; DL. 22 \u00a5{ 8-10; D.I. 23 \u20ac 11; D.l. 24 ff 12-13)\nAccording to Defendants, they have no control over the aggregators\u2019 employees or conduct, and\nnone of Defendants\u2019 employees engage in the alleged \u201cunauthorized access\u201d of Ryanait\u2019s\nwebsite. (Id. at4) Moreover, Defendants are not aware of any specific Ryanair tickets that\nhave been sold to individuals in the District of Delaware, although Ryanair tickets have been\nsold to U.S. consumers in other states. (Jd. at 6-7)\n\nRyanair\u2019s Complaint contains one claim for a violation of the CFAA. (/d. <j 120-27)\nRyanair cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(2)(C), (a)(4), and (a)(5)(A)-(C) as the bases for its claim. (ad.\n{{ 122-25)* Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\n(D.I. 16; see also D.I. 17 at 7-21) Defendants also argue that the Complaint should be dismissed\nbecause it involves an improper, extraterritorial application of the CFAA. (D.I. 17 at 21-26)\u00b0\nThe Court received full briefing and numerous declarations submitted by Defendants. (D.I. 17,\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28) The Court also heard oral argument on April 15, 2021.\n\n(See DI. 33) (\u201cTr.\u201d)\n\n4 Ryanair previously sued Booking.com and an Etraveli subsidiary, OY SRG Finland\nAB, in the Irish courts. (D.I. 18 45; D.J. 18-1 Ex. 1) That case remains pending.\n\n5 Defendants alternatively asked the Court to stay the case pending the resolution of two\nCFAA cases that were pending before the Supreme Court. (See D.I. 17 at 26-30) (citing Van\nBuren v. United States, No. 19-783 (filed Dec. 18, 2019); LinkedIn Corp. v. hiQ Labs, Inc., No.\n19-1116 (filed Mar. 9, 2020)) After the oral argument in the instant case, the Supreme Court\nissued its opinion in Van Buren y. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1648 (2021). Shortly thereafter, in\nLinkedIn Corp. v. hiQ Labs, Inc., the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment,\nand the remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for further\nconsideration in light of Van Buren. See 141 S. Ct. 2752 (2021). This Court then ordered\nsupplemental briefing on: (i) the impact (if any) of the Supreme Court\u2019s Van Buren decision on\nthis case and (ii) the contours of the presumption against extraterritoriality. (D.I. 35; see also\nDI. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40) Defendants\u2019 request for a stay is now moot.\n\n4\n\nLEGAL STANDARDS\n\nL Forum Non Conveniens\n\nThe doctrine of forum non conveniens arises from the Court\u2019s \u201cpower to decline jurisdiction\nin exceptional circumstances.\u201d Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 504 (1947). Under the\ndoctrine, the Court may dismiss a case if trial in this District would result in \u201coppressiveness and\nvexation to a defendant\u201d that is \u201cout of all proportion to [the] plaintiff's convenience\u201d or if trial\nwould cause \u201cadministrative and legal problems\u201d for the Court. Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454\nU.S. 235, 241 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). For dismissal to be appropriate, the Court\nmust first determine that \u201can adequate alternat[ive] forum can entertain the case.\u201d Trotter v. 7R\nHoldings LLC, 873 F.3d 435, 442 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). If so, then the\nCourt must consider how much deference to give to the plaintiff's choice of forum. See id. The\nplaintiff's decision to sue in its chosen forum \u201c\u2018should rarely be disturbed.\u201d\u201d Delta Air Lines, Inc. v.\nChimet, S.p.A., 619 F.3d 288, 294 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Piper Aircraft, 454 US. at 241). As the\nfinal step in the analysis, the Court balances a variety of private and public factors. See id\u00ae At that\n\nstep, the defendant must show that the factors point \u201cdecidedly in favor\u201d of trial in the alternative\n\n6 The private factors include: \u201c(1) the ease of access to evidence; (2) the potential for\ncompulsory attendance for uncooperative witnesses; (3) the cost of procuring cooperative\nwitnesses; (4) the proximity to any pertinent locations; and (5) the miscellaneous practical\nadvantages which make trial easier and less expensive.\u201d Tradimpex Egypt Co. v. Biomune Co.,\n777 F. Supp. 2d 802, 808 (D. Del. 2011).\n\nThe public factors include: \u201c(1) court congestion; (2) the local interest in deciding local\ncontroversies; (3) the benefit of litigating cases within a forum that traditionally applies the\napplicable law; (4) the avoidance of unnecessary problems in law application, such as conflicts\nof laws; and (5) the unfairness of burdening citizens with jury duty.\u201d Id.\n\nIna particular case, the Court may identify additional factors that are pertinent. See\nTrotter, 873 F.3d at 442 (citing Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 528-29 (1988)).\nThe Court has considerable discretion in determining which factors are relevant and in assessing\nthe overall balance. See id.\nforum. Windt v. Qwest Commce\u2019ns Int'l, Inc., 529 F.3d 183, 190 (3d Cir. 2008); see also Sinochem\nInt\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430 (2007) (noting that defendant\n\u201cordinarily bears a heavy burden,\u201d although that burden may be reduced when \u201cplaintiffs choice is\nnot its home forum\u201d). The defendant must make a strong showing because dismissal of the\nplaintiff's case is a \u201charsh result.\u201d Atl. Marine Constr. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for W. Dist. of Tex., 571\nUSS. 49, 66 n.8 (2013) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\nIL. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n\nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires the\nCourt to accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372\nF.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir. 2004). \u201cThe issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but\nwhether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232,\n236 (1974)). Therefore, the Court may grant such a motion to dismiss \u201conly if, accepting all well-\npleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff,\nplaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 22\\ F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018raise a right to\nrelief above the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true\n(even if doubtful in fact).\u2019\u201d Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting\nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).\n\nUltimately, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that\ndiscovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff's claim. Wilkerson v.\nNew Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\nThe Court is not obligated to accept \u201cbald assertions\u201d as true. Morse v. Lower Merion\nSch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor is it\nobligated to credit \u201cunsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences.\u201d Schuylkill Energy\nRes., Inc. v. Pa. Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405, 417 (3d Cir. 1997). The Court may likewise\nreject allegations that are \u201cself-evidently false.\u201d Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nI. Forum Non Conveniens\n\nA. The Court Assumes Ireland Provides An Adequate Alternative Forum\n\nUnder the first step of the forum non conveniens analysis, the Court must consider\nwhether Ryanair could proceed with its suit in an adequate alternative forum. In this case, the\nrelevant alternative forum is Ireland. (See D.J. 17 at 8-10) Defendants emphasize that Ryanair\nhas already sued Booking.com in Ireland for essentially the same conduct at issue here. (See\nD.L. 18 45; D.L. 18-1 Ex. 1) The existence of a parallel suit involving some of the same parties\nand some of the same allegations is a clue that Ireland may provide an adequate alternative\nforum. See, e.g., Ranza v. Nike, Inc., 793 F.3d 1059, 1077 (9th Cir. 2015) (holding that foreign\ntribunal provided adequate alternative forum because plaintiff unsuccessfully litigated claim\nthere).\n\nRyanair cannot assert a violation of a U.S. statute, such as the CFAA, in the Irish courts.\n\n(See Tr. at 32) Ryanair\u2019s claim against Booking.com in Ireland instead sounds in breach of\ncontract, trespass, and other theories. (D.I. 18 8; D.I. 18-1 Ex. 1 99-22) That Ryanair\ncannot pursue the same claim in Ireland does not automatically render Ireland an inadequate\nforum. See, e.g., PT United Can Co. v. Crown Cork & Seal Co., 138 F.3d 65, 74 (2d Cir. 1998)\n(\u201cThe availability of an adequate alternat[ive] forum does not depend on the existence of the\nidentical cause of action in the other forum.\u201d). Dismissal of the instant suit under forum non\nconveniens may be appropriate even if \u201cthe law applicable in the alternative forum is less\nfavorable to the plaintiff's chance of recovery.\u201d Piper Aircraft, 454 U.S. at 250.\n\nRyanair challenges the adequacy of Ireland as an alternative forum. First, Ryanair notes,\ngenerally a defendant must show that it is \u201camenable to process\u201d in the proposed alternative\nforum. Tradimpex,777 F. Supp. 2d at 807. Here, when Defendants first filed their motion,\nthey did not indicate that they were amenable to process in Ireland. In their reply brief and\nduring the hearing, however, Defendants confirmed that they are amenable to process in Ireland\n~if, and only if, this case is dismissed for forum non conveniens. (D.I. 27 at 2; Tr. at 21, 64-65;\nsee also D.I. 28 ] 3-5) Given that representation, amenability to process in Ireland does not\npresent a meritorious basis to deny Defendants\u2019 motion.\n\nSecond, the alternative forum \u201cmust offer reasonable remedies\u201d in order to be adequate,\nTradimpex, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 807, but there is little in the record on which the Court can\ndetermine what remedies would be available to Ryanair under Irish law. Ryanair asserts\nnumerous theories of liability in the Irish litigation; it is possible that prevailing on one of those\ntheories might provide Ryanair with an opportunity for redress comparable to what it could\nobtain under the CFAA. Defendants have not clearly articulated how they believe the Court\n\nshould view the various Irish causes of action. See, e.g., Weisel Partners LLC v, BNP Paribas,\n2008 WL 3977887, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 26, 2008) (noting that \u201cdefendants ha[d] not identified\nany Indian law that would be analogous or comparable\u201d to CFAA); Azima v. RAK Inv. Auth., 305\nF. Supp. 3d 149, 173 (D.D.C. 2018) (\u201c[T]he onus is not on the district court to research the\nproposed alternative forum in order to make the necessary assessment of its adequacy[.]\u201d), rev'd\non other grounds, 926 F.3d 870 (D.C. Cir. 2019). Instead, Defendants fall back on the Irish\nHigh Court\u2019s conclusion that it has jurisdiction to hear a case involving screen scraping. (See\nD.1. 27 at 1-2) The Irish court\u2019s conclusion did not speak to the merits of the case or remedies.\n(See D.I. 18-1 Ex. 3957) Because the Court is denying Defendants\u2019 motion on other grounds,\nthe Court will assume without deciding that the Irish courts provide reasonable remedies for the\ndisputed conduct and, therefore, Ireland provides an adequate alternative forum for Ryanair.\u2019\n\nB. Plaintiff\u2019s Choice Of Forum\n\nRyanair is a foreign plaintiff, so its choice of the District of Delaware as its preferred\nforum \u201cdeserves less deference\u201d than the same choice by a domestic plaintiff because it is less\nlikely that a trial here will be convenient for Ryanair. See Piper Aircraft, 454 U.S. at 256; see\nalso Windt, 529 F.3d at 191. Ryanair does not dispute this point. (D.I. 26 at7) At this stage of\nthe case, however, the Court cannot agree with Defendants it is \u201cclear\u201d that Ryanair is attempting\n\u201cto press harassing, duplicative litigation.\u201d (D.J. 17 at 11) Nor is the Court persuaded that Ryanair\n\nhas brought this case here simply to take advantage of law it might perceive as more favorable to it.\n\n7 In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Van Buren, Defendants now argue that\nIreland is not only an adequate forum but also \u201cthe only potentially viable forum\u201d for Ryanair\u2019s\nclaim. (D.I. 36 at 3) (emphasis added) The Court does not view Van Buren as preventing\nRyanair from bringing any viable CFAA claim against Defendants. Van Buren specifically\naddressed what it means for a computer user to \u201cexceed[] authorized access,\u201d as that term is used\ninthe CFAA. See 141 S. Ct. at 1662. Ryanair alleges that Defendants acted \u201cwithout\nauthorization,\u201d which implicates a distinct statutory prohibition that was not at issue in Van\nBuren. (D.1.37 at 1; see also D.L. 40 at 1)\n\nSee Kisano Trade & Invest Ltd. v. Lemster, 737 F.3d 869, 874 (3d Cir. 2013). Ryanair sued three\nDelaware companies \u2014 Booking Holdings, KAYAK, and Priceline \u2014 in their home forum. This isa\nlogical and legitimate basis on which to sue these companies, even absent a strong showing that\nlitigating here is convenient for Ryanair. Moreover, the only other forum in the United States where\nRyanair logically might have brought its suit is the District of Connecticut, where the same three\ncompanies have their principal places of business. As between these two Districts, the Court is\nrequired to give at least some deference to Ryanair\u2019s choice of Delaware. See Lacey v. Cessna\nAircraft Co., 862 F.2d 38, 45-46 (3d Cir. 1988) (stating that district court \u201cshould have accorded\nat least some weight\u201d to foreign plaintiffs choice of forum).\u00ae\n\nCc. Private Interest Factors\n\nHaving assumed that Ireland provides an alternative forum and having determined that\nRyanair\u2019s choice of forum is entitled to at least some deference, the Court turns to a\nconsideration of the pertinent private and public interest factors. Because a plaintiffs decision to\nsue in its chosen forum \u201c\u2018should rarely be disturbed,\u2019\u201d Delta Air Lines, 619 F.3d at 294 (quoting\nPiper Aircraft, 454 U.S, at 241), the Court should not dismiss the instant action unless Defendants\nshow the pertinent factors point \u201cdecidedly in favor\u201d of trial in Ireland, Windt, 529 F.3d at 190. As\n\nexplained below, Defendants have failed to make such a showing.\n\n\u00a7 Defendants argue that Ryanair\u2019s choice of forum is entitled to \u201cno deference\nwhatsoever\u201d because Van Buren clarified that the CFAA is intended to remedy \u201ctechnological\nharms,\u201d which they contend Ryanair has not suffered. (D.I. 36 at 3) The Court disagrees.\nRyanair has alleged that Defendants\u2019 conduct caused Ryanair to \u201cspen[d] considerable resources,\nin excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000), to find, diagnose, and block access\u201d to its website.\n(Compl. 194) Such harm fits within the CFAA\u2019s definition of \u201closs,\u201d which includes\nreasonable costs incurred \u201cresponding to an offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(e)(11). Nothing in\nVan Buren requires the Court to refrain from according any deference to Ryanair\u2019s forum\npreference.\n\n10\nFirst, the Court considers access to sources of proof. See Trotter, 873 F.3d at 442, As\nRyanair alleges that Defendants have engaged in unauthorized conduct, relevant evidence for\nBooking Holdings, KAYAK, and Priceline is likely located in Connecticut. See generally In re\nGenentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\u201cIn patent infringement cases, the bulk of\nthe relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer.\u201d) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Connecticut is much closer to, and far more conveniently accessed from, Delaware\nthan Ireland. It is quite likely that additional evidence may be located abroad: evidence from\nRyanair in Ireland, evidence from Booking.com and Agoda in the Netherlands and Singapore,\nand evidence from third-party ticket aggregators in Europe and Singapore. With the help of\nmodern technology, most (if not all) relevant documents should be electronically available and\naccessible regardless of where this case proceeds. See, e.g., Tradimpex, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 810\n(\u201c[T]echnology makes the physical location of documents relatively unimportant .. . .\u201d), To the\nextent that any foreign, non-Irish third parties may not be willing to provide certain documents,\nthose difficulties would not be solved by litigating this case in Ireland. On the whole, then,\naccess to sources of proof does not favor dismissal.\n\nNext, the Court considers the availability of compulsory process for any unwilling\nwitnesses. See Trotter, 873 F.3d at 442. Any party can be required to appear in this District.\nSee generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 (authorizing sanctions for failure to cooperate). Neither\nRyanair nor any Defendant has pointed to any unwilling witness who resides in this District or in\nIreland. To the extent that there may be other relevant witnesses in other countries, it appears\nthat the Irish court and this Court would be equally unable to compel their attendance. This\n\nfactor does not favor dismissal.\n\nil\nThe cost of attendance for willing witnesses also does not support Defendants\u2019 position.\nSee Trotter, 873 F.3d at 442. Defendants have not persuaded the Court that none of their\nwitnesses in the United States possess relevant information. (See D.I. 17 at 15-16) Even\naccepting that third-party ticket aggregators perform the alleged screen scraping, Defendants\npresumably employ individuals who manage their relationships with the aggregators. For\nBooking Holdings, KAYAK, and Priceline, those employees are likely located in Connecticut,\nand those witnesses would find it more convenient to attend trial in Delaware than in Ireland.\nAlthough it would be more convenient for Ryanair employees to attend trial in their home\ncountry, Ryanair has voluntarily assumed the burden of arranging for its employees to travel to\nthis District. (D.I. 26 at 12) It may be easier for Booking.com employees to travel from the\nNetherlands to Ireland than to Delaware, but Agoda employees in Singapore will need to travel a\nlong distance no matter the trial forum. Again, this factor does not favor dismissal.\n\nNeither Ryanair nor any Defendant has offered any persuasive reason why a view of any\npremises would be required in this case. (See D.I. 17 at 12 n.7; D.I. 26 at 13; DI. 27 at 5) This\nfactor does not favor dismissal.\n\nAs for whether there are practical problems that may make trial easy, expeditious, or\ninexpensive in Ireland or in Delaware, see Trotter, 873 F.3d at 442, Defendants insist this case is\nduplicative of Ryanair\u2019s case in Ireland and, therefore, presents a risk of conflicting findings.\n(D.I. 17 at 16) In the Court\u2019s view, this case is not duplicative, as it involves a cause of action\nunder U.S. law and four defendants who are not involved in the Irish case. Defendants also\npoint to the expense of compliance with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation\n(\u201cGDPR\u201d), requiring the redaction of personally identifiable information. (D.I.17 at 17) But\nDefendants do not challenge Ryanair\u2019s contention that compliance with the GDPR will be an issue\n\n12\neven if this dispute were to proceed in Ireland. (DI. 26 at 15; D.I. 27 at 5-6) Overall, then, no\npractical problems exist that would favor dismissal of the instant case.\n2. Public Interest Factors\n\nAs the first public interest factor, the Court considers whether trial of the case in the\nalternative forum would help alleviate court congestion. See Trotter, 873 F.3d at 442. While\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware is extremely busy \u2014 one of the busiest federal\ndistrict courts in the United States, see, e.g., D.I. 19-1 Ex. 7 \u2014 the Court is confident it can\neffectively manage this case on its docket, even though the elimination of one case from the\nCourt\u2019s docket would to some minimal extent reduce the overall burden. Even assuming the\nIrish court could proceed to trial more quickly, this factor does not meaningfully favor dismissal.\n\nThis District has a local interest in the case because Ryanair alleges that three Delaware\ncitizens \u2014 Booking Holdings, KAYAK, and Priceline \u2014 have gained unauthorized access to\nRyanair\u2019s website and violated U.S. law in doing so. See Tradimpex, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 810.\nEven though Defendants are not aware of any Ryanair tickets sold to any users of Defendants\u2019\nwebsites in Delaware (see D.I. 17 at 19) (citing D.I. 20 16; D.I. 21 11; D.1. 23 | 8; D.I. 24\n411), and the Court assumes no Delawareans have been harmed as consumers, under the totality\nof circumstances in this case, the allegations against multiple Delaware corporate citizens justify\nthe burdens that may be imposed on Delawareans to sit as jurors.\n\nThis Court is more familiar with U.S. law, including the CFAA, while the Irish court is\nmore familiar with causes of action under Irish law. The Court is not persuaded that, in keeping\nthis case, it will be required to decide any issues of Irish law, including in connection with the\n\nTerms of Use. Accordingly, this factor does not weigh in favor of dismissal.\n\n13\n3. Balance Of Factors\n\nDespite the limited connection between Defendants and this District, the private and\npublic factors do not tip decidedly in Defendants\u2019 favor. See Windt, 529 F.3d at 190\u00b0 This\nconclusion is in accord with the decision of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of\nWashington in a similar case brought by Ryanair against another online travel agency. See\ngenerally Ryanair DAC v. Expedia Inc., 2018 WL 3727599 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 6, 2018).!\u00b0 In\nsum, Defendants face a heavy burden to obtain dismissal based on the doctrine of forum non\nconvienens, see Atl. Marine Constr. Co., 571 U.S. at 66 n.8, and they have not met that burden here.\nI. Presumption Against Extraterritoriality\n\nAs an alternative basis for dismissal, Defendants moved under Rule 12(b)(6) based on\ntheir view that Ryanair\u2019s Complaint alleges extraterritorial conduct beyond the reach of the\nCFAA. (See D.I. 17 at 21-26) The Court disagrees.\n\nThere is a baseline assumption that federal statutes \u201capply only within the territorial\njurisdiction of the United States.\u201d Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281, 285 (1949). This\nprinciple is known as the \u201cpresumption against extraterritoriality.\u201d WesternGeco LLC v. ION\nGeophysical Corp., 138 S. Ct. 2129, 2136 (2018). The presumption \u201cserves to protect against\nunintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations.\u201d Egual Emp. Opportunity\n\nComm\u2019n v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991). To decide questions of\n\n\u00b0 Defendants argue that Van Buren tilts the private and public factors further in their\nfavor. (D.1. 36 at 4-6) That argument is premised on the same overly broad reading of Van\nBuren that the Court has already rejected. See supra note 7.\n\n10 The principal difference in that case was that Ryanair sued the defendant, Expedia, in\nthe same district where Expedia\u2019s headquarters were located. See Expedia, 2018 WL 3727599,\nat *1.\n\n14\nextraterritoriality, the Supreme Court has articulated a two-step framework. See WesternGeco,\n138 S. Ct. at 2136. First, the Court asks \u201cwhether the presumption against extraterritoriality has\nbeen rebutted\u201d with a \u201cclear, affirmative indication.\u201d RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. Eur. Cmty., 1368.\nCt. 2090, 2101 (2016). Ifnot, then the Court must decide \u201cwhether the case involves a domestic\napplication of the statute . . . by looking to the statute\u2019s \u2018focus.\u2019\u201d Jd.; see also Morrison v. Nat'l\nAustl. Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 266-70 (2010).\n\nOne provision of the CFAA asserted by Ryanair makes it a federal crime to \u201cintentionally\naccess[] a computer without authorization,\u201d thereby obtaining \u201cinformation from any protected\ncomputer.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(2)(C). 1! The CFAA defines the term \u201cprotected computer\u201d to\ninclude a computer \u201cused in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication,\nincluding a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects\ninterstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1030(e)(2)(B)\n(emphasis added). Although the operative provisions are written to proscribe criminal conduct,\nthe CFAA establishes a private right of action against alleged violators of the same provisions.\nSee id. \u00a7 1030(g).\n\nBased on the text of the CFAA, the Court resolves the extraterritoriality issue at the first\nstep of the Supreme Court\u2019s framework. Through the provisions quoted above, Congress has\nprovided a \u201cclear, affirmative indication\u201d that the CFAA applies extraterritorially. See RJR\nNabisco, 136 S. Ct. at2101. Specifically, the definition of \u201cprotected computer\u201d explicitly\n\nincludes computers located outside the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(e)(2)(B).\n\n\u20181 Ryanair also relies on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(4) and (a)(5)(A)-(C). (Compl. ff 123-25)\nEach provision uses the term \u201cprotected computer.\u201d\n\n15\nOn this point, the Court again agrees with the decision of the district court in the Expedia\ncase. As that court reasoned, the definition of \u201cprotected computer\u201d is \u201cas clear an indication as\npossible short of saying \u2018this law applies abroad.\u2019\u201d Expedia, 2018 WL 3727599, at *2 (quoting\nMorrison, 561 U.S. at 265).\n\nBecause Congress indicated a clear intent for the CFAA to apply extraterritorially, the\nCourt will not dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\u00b0\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion will be denied. An appropriate order\n\nfollows.\n\n? Defendants argue that Ryanair \u201cseeks to apply the CFAA .. . to alleged conduct by\nforeign actors to a foreign website causing foreign harm.\u201d (D.I. 17 at 21 (emphasis omitted);\nsee also id. at 24) (asserting that \u201cthe alleged perpetrator, the alleged victim, the alleged website,\nand all alleged instrumentalities are located outside of the United States\u201d) This is not an\naccurate portrayal of Ryanair\u2019s allegations. Instead, Ryanair charges that three Delaware\ncompanies, along with two foreign companies in the same corporate family, engaged in conduct\nthat violates the CFAA \u2014 some of which conduct (e.g., using data obtained by screen scraping)\nmay have occurred in the United States for websites that are accessible in the United States,\n\n3 The Court ordered supplemental briefing on whether the presumption against\nextraterritoriality may function to prevent foreign defendants from being sued in U.S. courts.\n(D.I. 35) As Ryanair points out, the second step of the Supreme Court\u2019s two-step framework\n\u201clooks to the focus of the statute and the defendant\u2019s conduct, not to the defendant\u2019s residence.\u201d\n(D.I. 37 at 4) Defendants\u2019 cited cases involve prosecutions for crimes committed on the high\nseas, not civil enforcement of a statute like the CFAA. See, e.g., United States v. Al Kassar, 660\nF.3d 108, 118 (2d Cir. 2011) (explaining that extraterritoriality principles differ for criminal\nstatutes), Defendants raise due process concerns regarding the enforcement of the CFAA\nagainst the two foreign defendants \u2014 Booking.com and Agoda (D.I. 36 at 8-9) \u2014 but neither of\nthese parties has sought dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Complaint\nalleges that Booking.com\u2019s CFAA violation enables it to sell Ryanair tickets to consumers in the\nUnited States. (Compl. { 16; see also D.I. 20 ff 11, 16)\n\n16\n"}
