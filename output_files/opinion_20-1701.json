Stark", "date": "06-13-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nERIC LOUIS MEYERS, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civ. No. 20-1701-LPS \nNATAL Y ORROSTIETA, \nDefendant. \nEric Louis Meyers, North Wales, Pennsylvania. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nJune 13, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORAND UM OPINION I. INTROD UCTION \nPlaintiff Eric Louis Meyers (\"Plaintiff') filed this diversity action on action December 15, \n2020. (D.I. 1) Plaintiff appears prose and has been granted leave to proceed in Jorma pauperis. (D.I. \n4) The Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b). \nII. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff lives in Pennsylvania and Defendant lives in Delaware. (D.I. 2 at 2) They lived \ntogether in Delaware, and Plaintiff left the apartment after ending their relationship . (Id. at 4) \nPlaintiff asked Defendant for two pieces of furniture from the apartment and, on three occasions, \nDefendant refused Plaintiff. (Id.) Defendant is no longer speaking to Plaintiff. (Id.) \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD S \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915( e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted , or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" \nBall v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,452 (3d Cir. 2013). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a \ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a prose plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224,229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \"however inartfully \npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" \nErickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nIV. DISCUSSION \nThe Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. ''Federal courts are courts of limited \njurisdiction .\" Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). \"[T]hey have only \nthe power that is authorized by Article III of the Constitution and the statutes enacted by Congress \n1 pursuant thereto.\" Benderv. Williamsport AreaSch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534,541 (1986). Federal district \ncourts have subject matter jurisdiction over two types of cases: diversity jurisdiction cases and cases \nthat raise federal questions . See Gosch v. International Chptr. OJHorseshoers & Equine Trades, 200 F. \nSupp. 3d 484, 489 (M.D. Pa. 2016). The Court has an obligation to satisfy itself that it has subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction and may raise the issue sua sponte. See Nesbit v. Gears Unlimited, Inc., 347 F.3d 72, \n77-78 (3d Cir. 2003). A Court may not sua sponte dismiss a complaint for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction \"unless the defect is clearly incurable. \" Burns v. Femiani, 786 F. App'x 375, 379 (3d Cir. \n2019). \nA federal court has subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship when \"the \nmatter in controvers y exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is \nbetween ... citizens of different States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff is a \ncitizen of Pennsylvania and that Defendant is a citizen of Delaware. It alleges that the amount in \ncontrovers y is $3,500. In determining the jurisdictional amount, \"the sum claimed by the plaintiff \ncontrols if the claim is apparentl y made in good faith.\" St. Paul Mercury Indemnification Co. v. Red Cab \nCo., 303 U.S. 283,288 (1938). \nEven a liberal construction of the Complaint leads the Court to conclude that Plaintiff has \nfailed to satisfy the jurisdictional amount in controversy . Plaintiff alleges the amount in controvers y \nis $3,500 -a far cry from the required $75,000. The Courts finds it inconceivable that Plaintiff could \nbridge the gap between the two amounts. The jurisdictional defect is not curable. In addition, it is \nclear from the allegations that the Complaint does not raise a federal question. Therefore, the \nComplaint will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint for lack of jurisdiction . \nAmendment is futile. An appropriate Order will be entered. \n2 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nERIC LOUIS :MEYERS, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civ. No. 20-1701-LPS \nNATALY ORROSTIETA, \nDefendant. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 13th day of June, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion \nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Amendment \nis futile. \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case. \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT "}
