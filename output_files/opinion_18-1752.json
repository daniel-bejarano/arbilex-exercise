{"case_name": "Sprint Communications Company L.P. v. Cequel Communications, LLC et al.", "case_number": "18-1752", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "01-13-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSPRINT COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY \nL.P., \nPlaintiff; \nV. \nCEQUEL COMMUNICATIONS, LLC D/B/A \nSUDDENLINK COMMUNICATIONS AND \nCSC HOLDINGS , LLC D/B/A OPTIMUM\u00ad\nCABLEVISION , \nDefendants . Civil Action No. 18-1752-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is Defendants ' motion for summary judgment of no willfulness. (D.I. 253). I \nhave considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 254, 273, 298). The motion is limited to Defendant \nCSC Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Optimum-Cablevision (D.I. 254 at 1 n.1), which the parties refer to as \nCablevision. So do I. For the following reasons, Defendants ' motion is GRANTED. \n\"[T]he concept of 'willfulness ' requires a jury to find no more than deliberate or \nintentional infringement. \" Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enterprises, Inc., 946 \nF.3d 1367, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (citing Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 579 U.S. 93, 105 \n(2016)). Willfulness is a question of fact for the jury. WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co., 829 F.3d 1317, \n1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2016). When there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \n1 movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" summary judgment is appropriate. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). \nEvidence of willfulness in this case consists of: (1) a January 2010 letter from Sprint to \nCablevision , (2) evidence that Defendants knew of Sprint's prior VoIP litigation , and (3) \ndeposition testimony from a Sprint executive , Mr. Kalinoski , describing conversations with \nCablevision executives regarding Sprint's patents. (D.I. 254 at 2-3; D.I. 273 at 1-3). \nThe January 2010 letter cannot support a finding of willful infringement or even \nknowledge of the patents-in-suit. The letter was sent to Cablevision 's general counsel to \n\"request a meeting between our companies regarding Sprint's patent portfolio and how it may \napply to the operations of your company .\" (D.I. 255-1, Ex. A). The letter does not mention \ninfringement , list any patents, or describe any particular technology . (Id.). It merely requests \n\"the opportunity to discuss whether a license would be appropriate for some of your company 's \nactivities.\" (Id.). \nEvidence that Cablevision employees knew of Sprint's prior litigation , including a 2007 \nVonage verdict finding the patents valid and infringed , does not on its own or in combination \nwith the January 2010 letter support a finding of willfulness. \"[A]t least some Cablevision \nemployees in the legal department ... were on emails containing information that identified the \npatents and claims the V onage jury found to be valid and infringed. \" (D .I. 254 at 2 ( citing D .I. \n255-1, Ex.Fat 12)). Further, some Cablevision employees knew oflawsuits filed by Sprint in \n2008 and 2011 and shared Law360 reports about Sprint's patent litigation. (D.I. 254 at 2-3). \nThis evidence supports the inference that Cablevision had specific knowledge of the patents at \nissue. Knowledge alone is not enough. \"Knowledge of the asserted patent and evidence of \ninfringement is necessary, but not sufficient , for a finding of willfulness. \" Bayer Healthcare \n2 LLC v. Baxa/ta, Inc., 989 F.3d 964, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2021). There must be evidence suggesting \nCablevision's intent to infringe Sprint's patents. Here, there is no evidence that Cablevision \nfollowed up on its knowledge of the patents at issue in prior Sprint litigation or connected those \npatents to its own operations . \nFinally, the testimony of Mr. Kalinoski does not support a finding of willfulness, even in \ncombination with the letter and the emails. According to Sprint, \"The evidence ... establishes \nthat senior Sprint and Cablevision executives had three years of conversations about the scope of \nSprint's patents and their applicability to cable VoIP services like Cablevision 's.\" (D.I. 273 at \n1 ). Mr. Kalinoski testified, \"[M]y conversations I would characterize more as our -the Sprint \nengineers believe we have a strong portfolio as it relates to VoIP services.\" (D.I. 255-1, Ex.Eat \n36: 10-13). Mr. Kalinoski later confirmed that he himself was never part of a \"conversation, \nwhether it's oral or in writing, in which anyone from Sprint prior to the filing of this lawsuit told \nanyone from Cablevision or Altice that Sprint believed Cablevision or Altice were infringing any \nSprint patent.\" (Id. at 38:6-15). Mr. Kalinoski's testimony adds little to the picture. A jury \ncould already infer from Cablevision 's knowledge of Sprint's litigation that Sprint thought it had \nstrong VoIP patents. A Sprint executive 's touting of those patents without any mention of \ninfringement does not raise the inference that Cablevision knew or should have known that it \nwas infringing. \nThe evidence does not speak to Cablevision 's knowledge or even willful blindness of \ninfringement. None of Sprint's evidence connects its patents to an appreciable risk to \nCablevision that Cablevision might be infringing those patents. Sprint argues that my opinion in \nSprint Commc 'ns Co. v. Mediacom Commc 'ns Corp. supports a finding that Cablevision had the \nsubjective intent to infringe. (D.I. 273 at 6 (citing No. 17-cv-1736-RGA , D.I. 468 at 2 (D. Del. \n3 Mar. 16, 2021))). In Mediacom , Sprint had far more evidence of the defendants ' knowledge of \ninfringement. As I noted, \"the record [was] rife with references to Mediacom 's appreciation of \npatent infringement risk\" including \"its bargaining for the release of patent infringement claims \nas a part of' an agreement with Sprint. Id. at 2. Here, the evidence at best raises the inference \nthat Cablevision knew of the patents-in-suit and knew that those patents were in Cablevision 's \nfield of technolog y. There is no evidence pointing to an \"appreciation of patent infringement \nrisk\" by Cablevision. \nDefendants ' motion for summary judgment of no willfulness (D.I. 253) is GRANTED . \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 13th day of January, 2022. \n4 "}
