SHOTWELL , \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n  \nDELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF \nSAFETY AND HOMELAND \nSECURITY, ET AL. , \n \nDefendant s. \n No. 1:18-cv-984-SB \n \nMark J. Shotwell , Newark , Delaware.  \nPro se Plaintiff.  \n Kenneth Lee -Kay Wan, Deputy Attorney General, D\nELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF \nJUSTICE , Wilmington, Delaware.  \n \nCounsel for Defendant s. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nApril 14, 2021  \n \nBIBAS, Circuit Judge , sitting by designation.  \nCivil plaintiffs have no right to court -appointed counsel.  Yet lawyers are \nexpensive. So if a plaintiff cannot afford one or master his case alone, a court may 2 appoint counsel . But this case is straightforward, and the plaintiff has shown that he \ncan manage it himself . So I deny his request for  a lawyer . \nThe police arrested Mark Shotwell, then searched his  home and electronic s. D.I. \n28, at 1\u2013 2. Shotwell thought that the electronics search was unreasonable  and that  \nthe officers hand cuffed him with  excessive force. Id.  at 2. So he sued them pro se . D.I. \n17. He now asks me to  appoint  counsel. D.I. 64.  \nI have broad discretion  to decid e whether to appoint counsel Parkell v. Danberg , \n833 F.3d 313, 340 (3d Cir. 2016); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915(e)(1). But that discretion is bounded \nby a two-step test. Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 156 (3d Cir. 1993).  \nFirst, I ask a threshold question. Does Shotwell\u2019s case have \u201csome arguable \nmerit\u201d?  Parkell , 833 F.3d at 340. Yes: h e survived a motion to dismiss. D.I. 29; D.I. \n28, at 22. H is case thus \u201ceasily\u201d passes the first step . Powell v. Symons , 680 F.3d 301, \n308 n.5 (3d Cir. 2012).  \nSecond,  I assess \u201c the need for appointed counsel\u201d  by balancing six fact ors. Tabron , \n6 F.3d at 155\u2013 57. Here, they cut in different directions.  \nI start with \u201c[p]erhaps the most significant\u201d factor: Shotwell\u2019s ability to present \nhis case. Montgomery v. Pinchak , 294 F.3d 492, 501 (3d Cir. 2002) . To decide if he is \nup to the job, I look to his  \u201ceducation, literacy, prior work \u2026 and \u2026 litigation \nexperience. \u201d. Id. That consideration  weighs against appointing counsel. Id. So far, \nShotwell has admirabl y presented his case. He has \u201cfile[d] and respond[ed] to \nmotions, \u201d which \u201cindicate[s] \u2026 some legal knowledge.\u201d Id.  Plus, he has experience in \ncourt. See, e.g. , Shotwell v. Del. Dep\u2019t of Justice , 2016 WL 6901359 (D. Del. Nov. 22, 3 2016); Shotwell v. Sapp , 2019 WL 1056272 ( D. Del. Mar. 6, 2019) . Cf. Montgomery , \n294 F.3d at 502 (favoring counsel when it was plaintiff\u2019s first case).  \nTrue, Shotwell cites some \u201cmental health difficulties .\u201d D.I. 6 4, at 2. But there is \nno evidence that he is in competent . Cf. Powell , 680 F.3d at 308 \u201309 (reversing and \nremanding denial of counsel given evidence of incompetence).  Indeed, despite  his \ndifficulties , Shotwell\u2019s  \u201csubmissions demonstrate he is able to adequately present his \ncase.\u201d Monroe v. Bryan , 881 F. Supp. 2d 623, 628\u2013 29 (D. Del. 2012)  (denying counsel  \nfor competent plaintiff with \u201ccoherent and logical\u201d filing s).  \nThe second factor also cuts  against counsel : the legal issues  are not complex . See \nTabron , 6 F.3d at 156. Shotwell\u2019s excessive- force claim will not raise hard  legal \nquestions . See Monroe, 881 F. Supp. 2d  at 629 (same). Nor will his unreasonable -\nsearch claim. Plus, though  some digital- search  cases  may raise novel questions , this \none does not . At its core, Shotwell\u2019s digital- search claim  challenges the \nreasonableness of the officers\u2019 search terms. D.I. 17, at 7 \u20138, 22; D.I. 28, at 15.  And \nthis Circuit has treated \u201cthe reasonableness of searches\u201d as manageable for pro se \nlitigants. Parkell , 833 F.3d at 341.  \nThe third factor\u2014the  need  to investigat e and Shotwell\u2019s ability to manage  it\u2014is \nneutral . See Tabron , 6 F.3d at 156. On the one hand, Shotwell claim s that the officers \nhand cuffed him too tightly . D.I. 17, at 6. T hat needs minimal factfinding . Cf. Parham \nv. Johnson, 126 F.3d 454, 460 (3d Cir. 1997) (favoring counsel in cases with \u201ccomplex \nfacts \u2026 that even most lawyers struggle to comprehend\u201d ). Indeed, Shotwell has \ncapably handled discovery so far. See, e.g. , D.I. 63  (making 35 detailed requests for 4 documents) . Still, Shotwell\u2019s unreasonable -search claim might  involve technical  \ndiscovery . D.I. 17, at 20\u2013 22. And t hat may  be hard to collect and analyze .  \nThe next  factor\u2014how much the case involves credibility \u2014is also a wash . Tabron , \n6 F.3d at 156.  Skillful lawyering is often required to challenge  witness  testimony. \nAnd w hile the excessive- force claim may turn on witness reliability , the \nunreasonable -search claim  likely will not. So because this case is not \u201c solely  a \nswearing contest \u2026 this factor alone  does not encourage the appointment of counsel.\u201d \nParham, 126 F.3d at 460 (emphasis added).  \nAnd the last two factors tip  in Shotwell\u2019s favor. First , Shotwell\u2019s  ability to get \ncounsel is limited. See Tabron , 6 F.3d at 15 7 n.5. He cannot  afford counsel and has \nfailed to  locate  any volunteers . D.I. 64, at 1.  Then , consider the need for experts. \nShotwell\u2019s excessive- force claim probably does  not need experts . Yet his digital search \nclaim may, given its technical nature. D.I. 64, at 4.  And counsel can wrangle experts \nbetter than indigent litigants can. Montgomery , 294 F.3d at 505.  \nIn sum,  two factors favor appointing  counsel, two cut against, and two are neutral. \nBut the \u201cmost significant\u201d factor  cuts against appointment. Montgomery , 294 F.3d at \n501. Plus, \u201cthe pool of qualified attorneys \u2026 is a finite commodity,\u201d and I must be \n\u201cdiscerning []\u201d in deciding whether to appoint counsel. Id.  at 505 n. 10.  \nSo on balance, I do not find that Shotwell needs  counsel  now. Cf. id. at 505 \n(instructing that counsel is due when \u201cmost  of the [ Tabron ] factors have been met\u201d)  \n(emphasis added) . But if that balance is upended by a material change, Shotwell may  \ntry again. I  thus deny his motion without prejudice.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nMARK J.
