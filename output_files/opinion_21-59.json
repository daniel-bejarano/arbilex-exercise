( See D.I. 31).  The Government responded on September 9, 2022.1  (See D.I. 32).  The \nCourt conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding the issues raised on  November 2, 2022, during \nwhich it requested additional briefing from the parties.  ( See D.I. 34).  The parties completed \nsupplementary briefing on January 3, 2023.  ( See D.I. 36, 37 & 38).  The Court has carefully \nreviewed all  the filings and evidence submitted and listened to the testimony presented at the \nhearing .  For the reasons set forth in this opinion, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s \nMotion to Suppress is GRANTED.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nAt approximately 6:30 p.m. on July 23, 2021, Officers Williams  and Rosaio  (\u201cthe \nOfficers\u201d) were patrolling with their unit2 near the 1300 block of East 29th  Street in the Riverside \nneighborhood of Wilmington, Delaware.  (D.I. 34 at 5 :20-6:23).  The Officers were in an unmarked \npolice vehicle.  ( Id. at 6:12-16).   Upon turning left  onto East 29th  Street, the  Officers  observed an \nindividual3 on the corner look at  their vehicle and turn and shout something towards a group of \npeople standing further down the sidewalk.  ( Id. at 8:18-9:9 & 64:14-65:1).  The Officers testified \nthat based on their experience, they believed this  individual may be a \u201clookout\u201d and that he was \n \n1  Defendant did not file a reply.  \n \n2  The unit  included Officers Williams, Rosaio, Shulz and Moses. (D.I. 34 at 6:1 -7).  Only \nOfficers Williams and Rosa io testified .  (See D.I. 34). \n  \n3   Officer Williams  testif ied that he knew the individual from \u201cprevious police encounters\u201d \nbut did not specify the circumstances or nature of these encounters.  ( See D.I. 34 at 9:10-\n14).  In any event, the Government does not rely on this individual\u2019s conduct to support a \nfinding of reasonable suspicion, and thus, neither does the Court. 2 alerting the group of people that police were present .  (Id. at 9:24- 10:4 & 64:14- 65:9).  The Officers \nthen observed Defendant among th is group of people.4  (Id. at 11 :16-21, 12:12- 17 & 66:9- 13).   \nDefendant was carrying a black satchel on his right side.  (Id. at 11:16- 21).  After the \nindividual on the corner shouted, Defendant looked in the direction of the vehicle  and the  \nindividual .  (Id. at 12 :22-13:4, 66:20- 67:10 & 73:25- 74:4).  After Defendant looked towards the \nvehicle, the Officers saw the Defendant turn the right side of his body  \u2013 the side on which he \ncarried the satchel  \u2013 away from their vehicle, grab a wom an who was standing nearby around the \nneck or shoulder , pull her close to his right side and walk at a fast pace southbound towards a \ncourtyard.  (Id. at 12 :22-13:23, 14:17- 15:5, 36:22- 37:24 & 66:20- 67:10 ).  The testimony  is \nconflicting with respect to whether, at the point th at Defendant looked towards the vehicle, he was \nfacing north or south, whether he had  already been walking southbound or standing still  and in \nwhich direction he turned his body.5  (See id.  at 12:22- 13:23, 35:9- 37:8, 67:1 -10 &  73:20- 76:1).  \nThe Officers stated that, at this point, they believed Defendant was exhibiting \ncharacteristics of an armed gunman.  (Id. at 13:12- 16 &  67:11- 14).  The Officer s\u2019 belief was based \non their experience and train ing.  (Id. at 13 :17-14:16 &  60:25- 62:19) .  More specifically, the \nOfficers had received training that armed gunmen may turn their body away from police in order \n \n4  Officer Williams testified that he  knew of Defendant from previous \u201cencounters\u201d with him \nbut did not specify the circumstances of those encounters.  (See D.I. 34 at 12:5- 10).  Officer \nRosaio testified that he was \u201caware of\u201d Defendant.  (D.I. 34 at 66:14- 16).  \n \n5  Officer Williams testified  that Defendant  was standing still facing north, and, upon looking \ntowards the vehicle,  turned his body 180 degrees away from the vehicle and then began \nwalking southbound with the woman.  (See D.I. 34 at 12:24- 13:16 & 35:9- 37:8).  Officer \nRosaio testified  that Defendant  was already walking southbound, and, upon looking \ntowards the vehicle, angled his body slightly away from the  vehicle and continued walking \nsouth.  (See D.I. 34 at 67:1- 10 & 73:20- 76:1).  The officer reports are similarly \ncontradictory with respect to these facts.  (Compare  D.I. 31, Ex. C at PRITCHETT -\n00000013 with id. , Ex. D at PRITCHETT- 00000015- 16).  3 to hide  a firearm from view , also referred to as \u201cblading.\u201d  (Id.).  In addition, Officer Rosaio \ntestified he had received training that an armed gunman may position his body behind an object to \nblock law enforcement\u2019s view of the gun.  (Id. at 62:1 -7).  The \u201cblading\u201d coupled with the fact that \nDefendant  pulled the woman cl ose to the side on which he carried the satchel and quickly walked \naway from the vehicle indicated to the Officers that he may be armed .  (See id.  at 13:12- 16 & \n66:20- 67:14).   The Officers then g ot out of their vehicle and began walking towards Defendant \nwhile he was walking southbound away from their vehicle.6  (Id. at 15:20 -16:10 & 67:15- 20).  \nOfficer Williams shouted , \u201cStop, police .\u201d  (Id. at 16:21- 17:4).  Defendant picked up his pace \nwalking southbound.  (Id.).  Both Officers began to run towards Defendant.7  (Id. at 49 :18-51:5 &  \n67:17- 25).  Defendant then \u201creleased\u201d or \u201cpushed\u201d the woman he was walking with and ran into \nthe rear of the residence at 1313 East 28th Street8 on the southernmost side  of the courtyard. 9  (Id. \nat 17:2- 8 & 19:9- 12).  \n \n6  Just before getting out of the vehicle, Officer Rosaio turned on his body camera .  (See \nD.I. 31, Ex. H & D.I. 34 at 68:18- 23).  Officer Williams turned on his body camera after \nthe Officers  seized Defendant and were exiting the residence.  ( See D.I. 31, Ex I  & D.I. 34 \nat 25:12- 16).  The Court has reviewed both body camera recordings and liste ned to the \nOfficers \u2019 testimony explaining what can be viewed in the recordings during the evidentiary \nhearing.  Much of the testimony, however, pertains to circumstances either not recorded or \nnot visible in the video recordings.  \n \n7  At some point after D efendant picked up his pace, Officer Williams shouted \u201cStop, police\u201d \nagain, but it is unclear if this occurred before or after the Officers began running.  (See \nD.I. 34 at 16:21- 18:7).  \n \n8  The parties stipulated that Defendant is not a resident of 1313 Ea st 28th Street.  (See D.I. 34 \nat 2:8 -15).   \n \n9  At the hearing, there was initially some confusion with regard to whether it was Defendant \nor the Officers who ran first.  At first, Officer Williams testified that Defendant began to \nrun after the Officer \u201cpick[ed] up [his] pace.\u201d  (D.I. 34 at 16:23- 17:4).  Officer Williams \nlater clarified that he began to \u201cjog\u201d towards Defendant while Defendant was still walking in order to catch up.  (See id. at 49:18- 50:20; see also  D.I. 31, Ex. H  at 00:23).  Officer 4 The Officers  ran into the residence after Defendant , and Officer Williams took hold of \nDefendant inside the house.  (Id. at 18:20- 20:4 & 67:17- 2; see also  D.I. 31, Ex. H at 00:35).  Officer \nWilliams grabbed the satchel and felt what  he believed to be a firearm due to its L -shape and \nweight.  (D.I. 34 at 20 :21-21:9).  The Officers removed Defendant from the house , and he was \nplaced into handcuffs .  (Id. at 21:2- 4 & 22:2- 4; see also  D.I. 31, Ex. H at 01:03).  Officer Williams \nthen unzipped the satchel  and found a firearm inside.  (D.I. 34 at 21 :19-24; see also  D.I. 31, Ex. I \nat 00:18).   After Defendant was handcuffed, Officer Williams saw a white object fly from \nDefendant\u2019s  body.  (D.I. 34 at 24 :11-17; see also  D.I. 31, Ex. H at 01:49).  Officer Williams \ntestified that, upon seeing the object, he believed it to be packaged heroin based on his experience \nand training.  (Id. at 27:12- 19).  Officers placed Defendant in the back of their patrol vehicle and \ntook him to the station .  (D.I. 31, Ex. C at PRITCHETT- 00000013) .  Officer s also uncovered \n$1,467.00 in cash from the satchel, as well as two clear plastic bags containing pills from the area \nwhere Defendant was seated in the police vehicle and two additional bags of  what appeared to be  \nheroin from his person.  (See D.I. 31, Ex. C at PRITCHETT- 00000013- 14).  \nDefendant was arrested and subsequently charged and indicted with being a felon in \npossession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (1) and \u00a7 924(a)(2) , as well as indicted  \nfor possession with intent to distribute heroin and fentanyl in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) \nand \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) and with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) .  (See D.I. 1, 13 & 22).  Defendant moved to suppress all the \nphysical evidence uncovered as a result of his seizure.   (See D.I. 31).   \n \nRosaio also testified  that Officer Willia ms was \u201crunning\u201d while Defendant was still \nwalking towards the residence .  (See D.I. 34 a t 67:17-25).  5 II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d  U.S. Const. \namend. IV.  Any evidence obtained as a result of  an unreasonable search or seizure \u201cmust be \nsuppressed as \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019\u201d  United States v. Bey, 911 F.3d 139, 144 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(quoting Unites States v. Brown, 448 F.3d 239, 244 (3d Cir. 2006) ).  \u201cGenerally, for a search or \nseizure to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, it must be effectuate d with a warrant based \nupon probable cause.\u201d  Id.  \u201cWarrantless searches and seizures are presumptively unreasonable \nunless the Government satisfies its burden of establishing that one of the exceptions to the warrant \nrequirement applies .\u201d  Id. (citing  California v. Acevedo , 500 U.S. 565, 580 (1991) ).  One exception \nto the warrant requirement is the Terry10 stop.  Id.  Under Terry , an officer may \u201cconduct a brief , \ninvestigat ory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is \nafoot.\u201d  Illinois v. Wardlow , 528 U.S. 119, 123 (2000).  In order to establish reasonable suspicion, \nthe \u201cofficer must be able to  articulate more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \nhunch of criminal activity.\u201d   Id. at 123-24 (quoting Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968)) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) .  Rather, the officer must be able to \u201cpoint to specific and articulable \nfacts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that \nintrusion.\u201d  Johnson v. Campbell , 332 F.3d 199, 205 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting Terry , 392 U.S. at \n21) (internal quotation marks omitted ).  That is, the officer must have had \u201c some minimal level of \nobjective justification for making the stop .\u201d  United  States v. Thompson, 772 F.3d 752, 758 (3d Cir. \n2014) (quoting United  States v. Sokolow , 490 U.S. 1, 7 (1989)) (internal  quotation marks  omitted).   \nIn evaluating whether reasonable suspicion existed, a court must consider \u201cthe totality of \nthe circumstances  leading up to the moment of the defendant\u2019s seizure.\u201d United States v. Graves , \n \n10  Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 (1968).  6 877 F.3d 494, 498 (3d Cir. 2017).   The court must \u201cgive considerable deference to police officers\u2019 \ndeterminations of reasonable suspicion given their own experience and specialized training to \nmake inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that \nmight well elude an untrained person.\u201d  Id.  at 499 (quoting United States v. Brown, 765 F.3d 278, \n290 (3d Cir. 2014))  (internal quotation marks omitted ).  An officer m ay thus find reasonable \nsuspicion \u201cbased on acts capable of innocent explanation.\u201d  Id. (quoting United States v. Whitfield , \n634 F.3d 741, 744 (3d Cir. 2010)) (internal quotation marks omitted ).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nDefendant seeks to suppress the physical evidence obtained as a result of his seizure.  \n(D.I.  31 & 36).  Defendant argues that  the Officers seized and searched him without reasonable \nsuspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and thus the evidence must be suppressed.11  \n(See D.I. 36 at 1).  The Government counters that , at the time the Officers executed the Terry  stop, \nthey had reasonable suspicion that Defendant was  carrying a concealed weapon in violation of \n11 Del . C. \u00a7 1442.12  (See D.I. 37 at 8).  For the reasons below, the Court finds that the record \nbefore it is insufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion at the time of the seizure.  \n \n11  In his initial Motion, Defendant argued that the Officers  unlawfully entered the home at \n1313 East 28th  Street.  (D.I. 31 at 5- 7).  The Government countered that Defendant failed \nto establish that he had standing to assert his Fourth Amendment rights with respect to the \nentry of the house.  (D.I. 32 at 4-5).  Defendant d id not reassert the argument in his \nsupplemental briefing.  ( See D .I. 36 & 38).  After the supplemental briefing was completed, \nhowever, Defendant submitted \u201csupplemental authority\u201d  with several pages of argument \napparently attempting to revive the argument.  (D.I. 39 & 41).  Given that the Court finds that the Officers did not have reasonable suspicion to seize Defendant, regardless of their entry of the house, the Court does not reach the issue of Defendant\u2019s standing to challenge the warrantless entry of the residence.  \n \n12   The Government also argues that the Officers  had probable cause at the point of seizure.  \n(D.I. 37 at 9-10).  Defendant states that the Officers had no probable cause at the point of \nseizure but does not argue the issue substantively.  ( See D.I. 36).  The question of probable \ncause is relevant in as sessing the constitutionality of a warrantless arrest.   See United States \nv. Naved o, 694 F.3d 463, 474 (3d Cir. 2012)  (a showing of probable cause is required to 7 The parties do not dispute that the seizure, or Terry  stop, occurred when the Officers \ngrabbed hold of Defendant  inside the residen ce of 1313 East 28th  Street.  (See D.I. 31 at 7 & \nD.I. 37 at 7) ; see also  California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626- 27 (1991) (holding that  a seizure \nrequires \u201ceither physical force \u201d or \u201cwhere that is absent, submission to the assertion of authority\u201d). \nTherefore, the question is whether, at that point, the Officers had reasonable suspicion to effectuate \nthe stop.  See Graves , 877 F.3d at 498.  \nThe Government argues that the following circumstances support the Officers \u2019 reasonable \nsuspicion: ( 1) Defendant\u2019s presence in a high crime area, ( 2) Defendant\u2019s furtive conduct before \nhe walked away from the police vehicle, including \u201cblading\u201d his body and pinning a woman to his side and ( 3) Defendant\u2019s actions of walking away fr om the police vehicle, refus ing to obey police \ncommands and running into the house.  (See D.I. 37 at 8).  The Government\u2019s primary argument \nis that, under Illinois v.  Wardl ow, this evidence is sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion.  \n(See id.).  In Wardlow, the Supreme Court held that  a suspect\u2019s  unprovoked, headlong flight upon \nnoticing police  presence  in a high crime area supports a finding of reasonable suspicion.  See \n528 U.S. at 125.  The issues for the Court to consider are thus ( A) whether the government has put \n \nmake a lawful arrest ).  Neither of the party\u2019s briefs nor any of the evidence on record, \nhowever,  makes clear when the Terry  stop matured  into a formal arrest .  The Officers \ntestified that they took Defendant \u201cinto custody\u201d and placed him in handcuffs once outside \nof the house but do not clarify whether this was the point at which they arrested him .  \n(See D.I. 34 at 20:19- 21:4 & 67:17- 68:2).  The Court finds, however, that \u2014regardless of \nthe point of arrest \u2014the Officers lacked the reasonable suspicion required to lawfully stop \nDefendant in the first place.  Because the Officers lacked  reasonable suspicion at the point \nof seizure, they necessarily lacked probable cause as well.   See United States v. Graves , \n877 F.3d 494, 498 (3d Cir. 2017) (\u201cThe reasonable suspicion standard is lower than probable cause . . . .\u201d) .  Thus, all evidence obtained as a result of the stop, including \nevidence obtained that may have provided the Officers with probable cause to arrest , must \nbe suppressed.  The Court does not reach the issue of when the Terry  stop matured into a \nformal arrest.  See generally United St ates v. Goode , 309 F. App\u2019x 651, 653- 54 (3d Cir. \n2009) (nonprecedential ) (assessing whether a Terry stop had matured into a formal arrest).  8 forth sufficient articulable f acts to establish that Defendant was present in a high crime area, \n(B) whether Defendant\u2019s actions constitute unprovoked, headlong flight under Wardlow  and \n(C) whether , in light of the se two co nsiderations, the totality of the circumstances supports a \nfinding of reasonable suspicion.  The Court considers each of these issues in turn.  \nA. High Crime Area  \nThe Government asserts that Defendant\u2019s presence in a high crime area, coupled with the \nother evidence, supports a finding of reasonable suspicion.  (D.I. 37 at 8).  Defendant argues  that \nthe Government has not put forth sufficient evidence to show that the area in question is a high \ncrime area.   (D.I. 36 at 2-3).  The Court agrees with Defendant.  \nIn support of its contention that Defendant was present in a high crime area, the \nGover nment cites to the following testimony  from Officer Rosaio :  \nQ: And have you recovered firearms from individuals in the area of \nRiverside?  \n A: Yes, our unit has, yes.   . . . Q: All right. Specifically you \u2019re familiar with the area of 29th \nand Bowers?  \n A: Yes, sir.  \n Q: Have you investigated other cases there?  \n A: Yes.  \n Q: What kind of cases have you investigated in the area of 29th and Bowers Street?  \n A: Drug or firearms related cases.  \n Q: In terms of the amount of crime in that area, how would you describe it?  \n A: I would consider it to be a high crime, high drug area.  9 (D.I. 34 at 62:11- 63:6). The other evidence the Government cites to is the following testimony \nfrom Officer Williams:  \nQ. I\u2019m sorry, did you give the location where you were?  \n \nA: Riverside area to be exact, the 1300 block of East 29th Street, sir.  \n \nQ: And are you familiar with that area?  \n A: Yes, sir.  \n Q: Have you handled other investigations in that area?  \n A: Yes, sir.  \n Q: What kind of investigations?  \n A: Shootings, homicides, burglaries, drug complaints .  \n \n(D.I. 34 at 6:21- 7:4).  The Court has scoured the record and the only other evidence it can find \npertaining to this issue is from two o fficer reports.  Officer Rosaio\u2019s report states, \u201cIt should be \nnoted that [the area of 2800 Bowers Street] is a high crime/high drug area, where subjects will \nfrequently congregate to engage in illegal street level drug transactions and other various forms of \ncriminal activity.\u201d  (D.I. 31, Ex. C at PRITCHETT -00000012).  Officer Shulz\u2019s report states, \u201cIt \nshould be noted, [ the area of E ast 29th Street and Bowers Street] is considered a high crime/high \ndrug area within the City of Wilmington in which officers often respond to reports of shots \nfired/shootings, illegal drug possession/sales complaints, loitering etc.\u201d  (D.I. 31, Ex. E at \nPRITCHETT- 00000028 ).  \n The Court cannot find that this evidence constitutes the  specific, articulable fact s needed \nto support a r ational  inference that the area is a high crime  area.  The record is devoid of any \nspecific facts that point to the degree or amount of crime in the area or the time period in which \nthe referenced investigations or complaints took place .  See United States v. Wright , 485 F.3d 45, 10 53-54 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that \u201c temporal proximity between evidence of heightened criminal \nactivity and the date of  the stop\u201d at issue is relevant to assessing whether the government has met \nits burden to prove the area is high crime).  Although the evidence before the C ourt may establish \nthat there has been  some  crime in the area in question, it fails to establish that the area is a high  \ncrime area.  Mere conclusory statements that an area is \u201chigh crime\u201d and vague references to \n\u201cinvestigations\u201d and \u201c repor ts\u201d \u2013 without more  \u2013 fails to meet the minimum objective criteria  \nrequired to make a showing of reasonable suspicion.  \nThe Government argues that Defendant did not offer any evidence to support a finding that \nthe area i s not high crime.  ( See D.I. 37 at 12).  It is the Government, however, that bears the \nburden, not Defendant.  Here, the Government has failed to meet its burden and put forth sufficient \nspecific evidence to support a finding that the area in question is a high crime area.  See United  \nStates v. Navedo , 694 F.3d 463, 471- 72 (3d Cir. 2012) (\u201cThe evidence of a prior shooting in \nJanuary and a report of a domestic disturbance involving a gun in February, without more, did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to conclude that the area surrounding 315 Park Avenue was a high crime area . . . .\u201d); United  States v. Bonner , 363 F.3d 213, 216 (3d Cir. 2004) (district court finding \nthat an area was not high crime was not clearly erroneous when \u201cthe log book [of arrests] reflected that there was an average of 1.3 arrests per week, and that most of the arrests were for misdemeanors and summary offenses\u201d).  \nB. Defendant\u2019s Evasive Conduct \nIn addition, the Government contends that Defendant\u2019s walking away from the police \nvehicle and ultimately  running from the police, coupled with the other evidence , supports a finding \nof reasonable suspicion.  ( See D.I. 37 at 8).  The Government likens the facts of this case to those \nat issue in Wardlow , in which the Supreme Court held that headlong, unprovoked flight upon \nnoticing the police \u201cplus some other indicia of wrongdoing, can constitute reasonable suspicion.\u201d  11 Bonner , 363 F.3d at 217 (citing Wardlow , 528 U.S. at 125- 26).  Although the Court agrees that \nDefendant\u2019s evasive behavior is relevant to the reasonable suspicion inquiry, t he record before the \nCourt does not demonstrate that Defendant\u2019s conduct rise s to the level of the flight at issue in \nWardlow .  \nIn Wardlow , the Court distinguished  unprovoked flight from \u201c a mere refusal to cooperate,\u201d \nstating that an individual \u201chas a right to ignore the police and go about his business.\u201d  528 U.S. at \n125; see also Johnson v. Campbell , 332 F.3d 199, 208 (3d Cir. 2003) ( \u201c[A]n individual has a right \nto ignore the police and go about his business without that activity being deemed inherently \nsuspi cious.\u201d (quoting Wardlow , 528 U.S. at 125) (internal quotation marks omitted)) .  This \ndistinction is significant because \u201cthe Supreme Court has \u2018consistently held that a refusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.\u2019\u201d   Johnson, 332 F.3d at 208 (quoting Florida v. Bostick , 501 U.S. 429, 437 \n(1991) ).  In line with this precedent, t he Third Circuit has concluded that \u201c[w] alking away from \nthe police hardly amounts to the headlong flight considered in Wardlow and of course would not \ngive rise to reasonable suspicion by itself, even in a high- crime area.\u201d  United States v. Valentine , \n232 F.3d 350, 357 (3d Cir. 2000); see also Unite d States v. McCray , 148 F. Supp. 2d 379, 389- 90 \n(D. Del. 2001) (same); Hall  v. Dodge , No. 6:12- CV-1808- MC, 2013 WL 4782208, at *4 (D. Or. \nSept. 5, 2013) (\u201c[Defendant] did not engage in \u2018headlong flight ,\u2019 but merely continued walking \naway at a quicker pace than his prior \u2018very slow\u2019 pace.\u201d).  Therefore, Defendant\u2019s initial act of \nwalking away from the vehicle does not amount to the headlong flight at issue in Wardlow .  In \naddition, the fact that there was testimony that he was already walking in that direction before \nlooking towards the unmarked vehicle further weakens the weight this evidence holds in the \nreasonable suspicion inquiry.  ( See D.I. 34 at 67:1 -10).  12 The question is then whether Defendant\u2019s  act of running into the residence upon having \ntwo officers begin running towards him amounts to the headlong, unprovoked flight at issue in \nWardlow .  The Court finds that it does not.  The type of flight at issue in Wardlow  was immediate  \nflight upon notic ing mere police presence.  See Wardlow , 528 U.S. at 122- 24; cf. Navedo , 694 F.3d \nat 466, 471- 73, 477 ( applying Wardlow  in a case where Defendant  immediate ly fled upon noticing \npolice ); United  States  v. Starkey, No. 13 -654-1, 2014 WL 5810659, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 4, 2014) \n(same) ; United States v. Lopp, 186 F. Supp. 3d 1037, 1043 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (\u201cTypically, [headlong \nflight] is an extreme reaction to the mere presence of law enforcement: a sudden and high speed \ndeparture.\u201d) .  The evidence here does not show that Defendant \u2019s flight was immediate, unprovoked \nor done in response to mere police presence.  Rather, the testimony indicates that  \u2013 at most  \u2013 \nDefendant began walk ing towards a house in response to police presence  and, upon having two \nofficers run towards him, picked up his pace  to get inside the house .  Furthermore, a t the hearing, \nthe testimony and video evidence indicated that his \u201cflight\u201d likely covered a span of j ust a few  \npaces.  (See D.I. 34 at 18:17- 19 & 67:17- 68:2).  Although the Court finds that this evasive conduct \nappears  more suspicious than the act of  merely walking away or refusing to cooperate, the \nevidence, taken together, fails to show that this conduc t rises to the level of Wardlow -like flight. \nThe Court does not suggest that evasive behavior must rise to the level of Wardlow -like \nflight in order to be relevant to the reasonable suspicion inquiry.  \u201c[N]ervous, evasive behavior is \na pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion.\u201d   Wardlow , 528 U.S. at 124; see also  \nValentine , 232 F.3d at 357 ( noting that the act of walkin g away from police \u201cis a factor that can be \nconsidered in the totality of the circumstances \u201d).  Rather, the distinction between evasive conduct \nand unprovoked, headlong flight goes to the weight of the evidence in a reasonable suspicion \ninquiry.  Compare  Wardlow , 528 U.S. at  124-25 (headlong, unprovoked flight in a high crime area 13 creates reasonable suspicion ), with Valentine , 232 F.3d at 357 (walking away from police in a  high \ncrime area is not sufficient  to create reasonable suspicion ).  With th ese considerations  in mind, the \nCourt turns to assessing the totality of the circumstances at the moment of seizure.  \nC. Totality of the Circumstances  \nGiven the Court\u2019s finding that the Government has failed to show t hat the area in question \nis a high crime area, the evidence that r emains is the following: (1) Defendant\u2019s \u201cblading\u201d away \nfrom the unmarked vehicle and pulling  a woman to the side on which he carried a satchel , \n(2) Defendant\u2019s act of walking away  upon looking towards  the vehicle and pick ing up his pace \nafter Officer Williams  issued commands  and (3) Defendant\u2019s act of running into the house  after \nthe Officers began running towards him.  The Court finds that the totality of the evidence here is \ninsufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion.  \nFirst, even if the Court were to find that Defendant\u2019s conduct constituted the same type of \nheadlong flight considered in Wardlow , the unique facts of this cas e would be insufficient to \nsupport a finding of reasonable suspicion.  Headlong flight alone is not sufficient to justify a Terry  \nstop.  Navedo , 694 F.3d at 471-72 (3d Cir. 2012 ) (citing Wardlow , 528 U.S. at 124 ).  Rather, \nofficers need flight \u201cplus some other indicia of wrongdoing\u201d to justify the stop.  Bonner , 363 F.3d \nat 217.  Here, the \u201cother indicia of wrongdoing\u201d consists of the furtive movements such as \nDefendant\u2019s angling of his body away from an unmarked car and pulling a woman close to his \nside.  Although the Court gives considerable deference to the Officers\u2019 training and experience \nthat suggests such movements can indicate that a suspect may be armed, that deference here is \nweakened by the fact that the testimony surrounding Defendant\u2019s conduct was contradictory.  For example, one officer testified that Defendant was initially facing north, and upon looking towards \nthe vehicle, turned his body 180 degrees and began walking south.  (D.I. 34 at 12:24- 13:16 & 35:9-\n37:8).  In contrast, the other officer testified that Defendant was already facing south and walking 14 southbound when he looked towards the vehicle and then only \u201cslightly altered\u201d the position of \nhis body away from the vehicle upon looking towards it.  (D.I. 34 at 67:1-10 & 73:20-76:1).  \nFurthermore, there is no evidence on the record that the Officers knew that Defendant \nhimself was aware that the vehicle was an unmarked police vehicle.  Rather, they merely testif ied \nbroadly about being recognized in the area in general.  ( D.I. 34 at 10:16- 21 & 63:14-18); \nsee Graves , 877 F.3d at 498 (facts used to support reasonable suspicion must be \u201cspecific to the \nperson who is detained\u201d); United  States v. Castle , 825 F.3d 625, 636- 37 (D.C. Cir. 2016)  (officers \ndid not have reasonable suspicion when the government failed to put forth any evidence that \ndefendant making furtive movements was aware that an unmarked vehicle was a police vehicle \nbecause \u201cfurtive  gestures  are significant . . . only if they were undertaken in response to police \npresence,  [a]nd  a suspect  can respond to  the presence of a police officer only if  he has  recognized  \nhim as an officer\u201d (quoting United States v. Brown, 334 F.3d 1161, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 2003) ) (internal \nquota tion marks omitted) ).   \nThe Court understands that recollections may vary and does not suggest that corroboration \nregarding every detail of an encounter is required to support reasonable suspicion.  Nor does the \nCourt suggest that furtive conduct that officers have been trained to view as an indication that someone may be armed cannot allow a case of headlong flight to rise to the level of reasonable suspicion.  Rather, here, the record viewed as a whole is insufficient to support a finding that \nDefendant\u2019s  furtive conduct  \u2013 even coupled with headlong flight  \u2013 creates reasonable suspicion.  \nFurthermore, as noted above, Defendant\u2019s flight was not  a Wardlow -like flight, but rather \nresembled conduct in  between that at issue in Wardlow  and a mere refusal to cooperate.\n13  \n \n13  Thus, even if the Court were to find that the  area is high crime, the totality of the \ncircumstances would not support a finding of reasonable suspicion.  See Johnson, 332 F.3d \nat 208 (\u201c [A] refusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of 15 In addition, this is not a case in which the record supports a rational inference that \nDefendant was trespassing onto the residence or that those inside the residence were fearful of his \npresence.  In its brief, the Government points to testimony from Officer Williams  stating that he \nknew that Defendant did not live at 1313 East 28th  Street based on his prior experience.  (D.I. 34 \nat 18:22- 23).  The Government thus argues that the Officers had reasonable suspicion that \nDefendant was trespassing .  Residents,  however, were presen t when the Defendant ran into the \nhouse, and the record is devoid of any evidence  (e.g., conduct or statements from the residents)  \nthat suggest s Defendant was uninvited or the residents were fearful of his presence.  (See D.I. 31, \nEx. H at 00:36 & Ex. I at  00:01).  Rather, the evidence seems to point the other way.  For example, \nOfficer Rosaio apparently pushed  one of the residents out of the doorway of the house to chase \nafter Defendant.  (See D.I. 34 at 69:3- 8, D.I. 31, Ex. H at 00:36 & D.I. 31 at 4).  That resident  \nappear ed to be agitated by the Officers presence after yelling \u201cwait, wait\u201d as the Officers enter ed \nthe residence.  (See D.I. 34 at 54: 17-19 & D.I. 31, Ex. H at 00:32).  Therefore, t he Court cannot \nfind that the video evide nce, testimony and record as a whole  support a finding that the Officers \nhad reasonable suspicion that Defendant  was trespassing on to the property.14  \n \nobjective justification needed for a detention or seizure .\u201d (quoting Bostick , 501 U.S. at 437) \n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Valentine , 232 F.3d at 357 (\u201cWalking away from the \npolice hardly amounts to the headlong flight considered in Wardlow and of course would \nnot give rise to reasonable suspicion by itse lf, even in a high- crime area . . . .\u201d). T he \nevidence pertaining to Defendant\u2019s furtive movements and evasive conduct is  too weak to \nsupport a finding of reasonable suspicion even in a high crime area.  \n \n14  In addition, the Government argues that Defendant \u2019s conduct gave the Officers reasonable \nsuspicion that he was resisting arrest or detention in violation of 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1257(b) .  The \nGovernment does not cite to any caselaw that interprets 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1257(b) as \ncriminalizing flight from detention in ad dition to flight from arrest, and the Court is not \naware of any law that does so.  See D.I. 37 at 10 (citing United States v. Anderson, No. 11 -\n30-GMS, 2011 WL 4442733, at *10 (D. Del. Sept. 23, 2011) (\u201cThus, because the court \nagrees with the government\u2019s c ontention that [Defendant] resisted arrest by his flight . . . \nthe court need not address the issue of whether \u00a7 1257(b) criminalizes flight from 16 The Court thus finds that the totality of the circumstances fails to support a finding of \nreasonable susp icion.  Defendant  was seized  in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  All physical \nevidence obtained as a result of the seizure must be suppressed.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence is GRANTED.  An \nappropriate order will follow.  \n \n \ndetention.\u201d)).  Regardless, the Court has found that the Officers lacked reasonable \nsuspicion at the moment of  seizure.  Therefore , they were not conducting a lawful \ndetention, nor, a fortiori , a lawful arrest.  See Graves , 877 F.3d at 498 (\u201cThe reasonable \nsuspicion standard is lower than probable cause . . . .\u201d).  Thus, Defendant\u2019s conduct cannot \nserve as evidence to support reasonable suspicion that he was resisting a lawful arrest or \ndetention.
