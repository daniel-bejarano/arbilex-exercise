No. 21-1456-GBW \nCHANBOND, LLC, DEIRDRE LEANE, \nand IPNA V, LLC, \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore the Court are non-parties Gregory Collins and Kamal Mian's (collectively , the \n\"Proposed Intervenors \") Motion to Intervene and Unseal Documents (D.I. 100) and objections to \nsealing portions of the Court's October 5, 2022 Memorandum Opinion (D.1. 158). Defendant \nChanBond LLC (\"ChanBond \") opposes unsealing these documents (D.I. 118) and portions of the \nCourt's October 5, 2022 Memorandum Opinion (D.I. 157). The Court held a hearing on this issue \non November 29, 2022. Following the hearing, the Court allowed a group of interested non-party \ncable companies to file a letter explaining why these documents and portions of the Court's \nOctober 5 , 2022 Memorandum Opinion should remain under seal. See D .I. 201; D .I. 202. For the \nreasons stated below, the Court GRANTS the Proposed Intervenors' Motion to Intervene and \nUnseal Documents and REJECTS ChanBond 's proposed redactions to the Court's October 5, 2022 \nMemorandum Opinion. 1 \n1 The Court writes for the benefit of the parties and assumes their familiarity with this action. \n1 I. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nIt is well-settled that the public has a common law right of access to judicial proceeding s \nand records. See Littlejohn v. BIC Corp., 851 F.2d 673, 677-78 (3d Cir. 1988) (noting that the \npublic's right to such access is \"beyond dispute\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); \naccord United States v. Martin, 746 F.2d 964, 968 (3d Cir. 1984). The public's right of access \nextends beyond the ability to attend court proceedings and includes the right to inspect and copy \npublic records, including judicial records (i.e., those documents filed with the court, or documents \notherwise incorporated into a court's adjudicato ry proceedings ). In re Cendant Corp ., 260 F.3d \n183, 192 (3d Cir. 2001). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has explained \nthat this common law right of access, which carries with it a \"strong presumption \" in favor of \npublic access to judicial records, applies to pretrial motions of a non-discovery nature and the \nmaterial filed therewith. Id at 192-93. \nA district court has the power to unseal previously-sealed documents through its general \ndiscretionary powers. United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3d Cir. 2007). The common \nlaw right of access is not absolute, however, and may be rebutted. In re Avandia Mktg., Sales \nPractices & Prods. Liability Litig., 924 F .3d 662, 672 (3d. Cir. 2019). \"Despite the presumpt ion \n[of public access], courts may deny access to judicial records, for example, where they are sources \nof business information that might harm a litigant's competitive standing.\" Littlejohn , 851 F.2d at \n678. The party seeking to overcome the presumption of access to maintain the seal has the burden \nof showing that the \"interest in secrecy outweighs the presumption .\" Avandia, 924 F.3d at 672 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In doing so, the party must show that the \"material \nis the kind of information that courts will protect and that disclosure will work a clearly defined \nand serious injury to the party seeking closure.\" Avandia, 924 F.3d at 672 (internal quotation \n2 marks and citation omitted). The Court must then determine if the harm from the articulated injury \noutweighs the presumption of access. Pa. Nat 'l Mut. Casualty Ins. Grp. v. New Eng. Reins. Corp., \n840 F. App'x. 688, 690 (3d Cir. 2020). To overcome the strong presumption of public access, \ncourts must identify \"the compelling , countervailing interests to be protected, make specific \nfindings on the record concerning the effects of disclosure, and provide \u25a1 an opportunity for \ninterested third parties to be heard.\" Avandia, 924 F.3d at 672-73 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). \"[A] person's motive for inspecting or copying judicial records is irrelevant \nunder the common law right of access.\" Id. at 677. \nII. DISCUSSION \nThe Proposed Intervenors seek to intervene for the limited purpose of unsealing all \ndocuments filed under seal in this action on the basis that these documents have been previously \nfiled throughout the public domain.2 See D.I. 100; D.I. 101 at 1-4. That is, these documents3 are \n2 No party disputes that the Proposed Intervenors may permissively intervene pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 24(b) for the limited purpose of challenging sealed judicial records. See \nUnited States v. Smith, 123 F.3d 140, 145 (3d Cir. 1997). \n3 Specifically, the Proposed Intervenors seek to unseal the following documents: Complaint (D.I. \n2) and the Redacted Version of the Complaint (D.I. 5); First Amended Complaint (D.I. 6) and the \nRedacted Version of the First Amended Complaint (D.I. 8); Answer to First Amended Complaint \n(D.I. 11) and the Redacted Version of the Answer to First Amended Complaint (D.I. 16); Motion \nfor Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and for Expedited Delivery (D.I. 18) \nand its Redacted Version (D.I. 43); Opening Brief in Support for Temporary Restraining Order, \nPreliminary Injunction, and for Expedited Delivery (D.I. 19) and its Redacted Version (D.I. 44); \nAnswer to Complaint , Crossclaim against ChanBond, LLC, Counterclaim against CBV, Inc. (D.I. \n41) and its Redacted Version (D.I. 47); Answering Brief in Opposition to the Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and for Expedited Delivery (D.I. 48) and \nits Redacted Version (D.I. 67); Declaration of Akiva M. Cohen in Support of the Answering Brief \nin Opposition to the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and for \nExpedited Delivery (D.I. 49) and its Redacted Version (D.I. 68); Declaration of Deirdre Leane in \nSupport of the Answering Brief in Opposition to the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, \nPreliminary Injunction , and for Expedited Delivery (D.I. 51) and its Redacted Version (D.I. 69); \nAnswering Brief in Opposition to the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary \nInjunction, and for Expedited Delivery (D.I. 54) and its Redacted Version (D.I. 66); Reply Brief \n3 \"judicial records\" filed with this Court that have been publicly accessible in other litigation \nmatters, which belies any justification for maintaining their confidentiality . Id. Moreover, the \nProposed Intervenors seek to unseal the settlement amount contained in an arbitration award, and \nany figure in which the settlement amount could be derived therefrom , from various documents \nfiled under seal. D.I. 101 at 6; D.I. 158 at 1-2. ChanBond does not dispute that everything that \nhas been previously filed in the public domain should be unsealed in this matter. D.I. 118 at 2 \n(\"ChanBond does not object to the public filing of the agreements between the parties that the \nNon-Parties admit are already available in the public domain.\"). Nor do the other parties to this \naction oppose the unsealing of all agreements which have been publicly filed. Accordingl y, the \nCourt will unseal all documents identified in footnote 3. \nAlthough there is no dispute that publicly filed documents should be unsealed, ChanBond \nargues that justice \"requires the Court to seal the amount of the settlement and any associated \ninformation by which that amount can be calculated\" from any of the documents identified in \nfootnote 3. Id. In response to the Court's October 5, 2022 Memorandum Opinion, ChanBond \nreiterated that good cause exists to maintain the settlement amount, or amounts from which the \nsettlement amount can be reverse engineered , that is disclosed in the filings identified in footnote \n3 and the Court's October 5, 2022 Memorandum Opinion under seal or redacted. D.I. 157 at 2-4 \n(\"ChanBond and the Leane Defendants respectfull y submit that good cause exists to redact the \nportions of the Opinion that set forth the settlement amount in order to protect the interests of the \nin Support of the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction , and for \nExpedited Delivery (D.I. 65) and its Redacted Version (D.I. 81); Motion for Leave to File Sur\u00ad\nReply in Further Opposition of the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary \nInjunction , and for Expedited Delivery (D.I. 71) and its Redacted Version (D.I. 85); and Answer \nto Answer to Complaint , Crossclaim against ChanBond , LLC, Counterclaim against CBV, Inc. \n(D.I. 79) and its Redacted Version (D.I. 86). \n4 parties to the agreement against public dissemination of the confidential information contained in \nthe Opinion.\"). The Proposed Intervenors object to sealing or redacting the settlement amount and \nany associated information on the basis that such information has already been disclosed to the \npublic. See D.I. 158. Thus, the crux of the parties' dispute is whether the settlement amount, and \nany figure in which the settlement amount could be derived, should be unsealed pursuant to the \npublic's right of access. 4 \nChanBond urges the Court to maintain the settlement amount and any associated \ninformation under seal because the settlement agreement \"was entered into between and among \nChanBond and various non-parties ,\" and \"contained bargained for confidentiality provisions \ninuring to the benefit of these nonparties and with which ChanBond must comply.\" D.I. 118 at 2. \nChanBond contends that it \"and the non-party signatories to the settlement agreement will face \nsubstantial and irreparable harm if the settlement amount is disclosed publicly\" because they may \nface breach of contract claims or parties thereto may seek to rescind the agreement and reclaim the \nsettlement proceeds. Id. at 3-4. However , on August 5, 2022, counsel for the Proposed Intervenors \nnotified the Court that the settlement amount at-issue had been publicly disclosed since February \n4, 2022, in a complaint filed before the New York Supreme Court (the \"New York State Action\"). \nD.I. 137; see Mishcon De Reya New York LLP v. ChanBond, LLC, et al., Index No. 650575/2022 \n(N.Y. Sup. Ct.). On November 29, 2022, the Court held a hearing on this issue, where ChanBond \nconceded that the settlement amount had been publicly disclosed in the New York State Action, \n' \nand remained publicly disclosed , since February 4, 2022. D.I. 189. Immediately following the \n4 Importantly , the Proposed Intervenors are not requesting that the Court unseal the entirety of the \nsettlement agreement itself and have acknowledged that the settlement agreement has not been \nfiled in its entirety with the Court and, thus, is not a judicial record subject to the presumptive right \nof public access. D.I. 204. Rather, the \"Proposed Intervenors seek information that has been taken \nfrom that agreement and included in documents that have been filed with the Court.\" Id. \n5 November 29, 2022 hearing, a group of non-party cable companies (\"Cable Companies \") filed a \nletter with the Court explaining that the Cable Companies had only just \"learned that the total \ndollar figure in the underlying settlement agreement that gave rise to the present action was made \npublic in a separate litigation involving ChanBond and/or its attorneys , even though the terms of \nthe settlement agreement required that it be kept confidential. \" D .I. 190 at 1. Like ChanBond , the \nCable Companies urged the Court to maintain the settlement amount under seal because the \nsettlement agreement required that it be kept confidential. Id. \nThereafter , the Court ordered the Cable Companies to show good cause as to why the \nunderlying settlement agreement and its terms shall remain confidential and under seal in light of \nthe disclosure in the New York State Action. DJ. 200. In response, the Cable Companies again \nreiterated that \"the private settlement would not have been executed but for the bargained-for \nconfidentiality provision. \" DJ. 201 at 1. Further, the Cable Companies explained that \"[f]iling \nthis private agreement or its terms in the public record [would] eviscerate \u25a1 the intention of the \nparties and causes a clearly defined and serious injury.\" Id. The Cable Companies also represented \nthat they were coordinating with counsel in the New York State Action to seal the complaint which \npublicly disclosed the settlement amount. See DJ. 202, Ex B; id. at Ex. D (counsel in the New \nYork State Action representing that \"[t]he parties agreed to work together to effectuate the \nredaction of the citations to the alleged settlement value ... in the Complaint in this action\"). \nOn this record, the Court cannot conclude that any harm from disclosure of the documents \nat issue outweighs the \"strong presumption \" in favor of public access to judicial records. See In \nre Application ofStorag Etzel GmbH, No. 19-209-CFC , 2020 WL 2949742, at *29 (D. Del. Mar. \n25, 2020) (\"After material appears unsealed on a court's docket, and therefore in the public \ndomain, there are little, if any, plausible justifications for subsequently sealing the same \n6 material.\"). Importantl y, there is no dispute that the settlement amount has been publicly available \nin the New York State Action since February 4, 2022. And, although the Cable Companies \ncoordinated with counsel in the New York State Action to seal the complaint which publicly \ndisclosed the settlement amount, a review of the New York State Action's docket reveals that the \nmotion to seal the settlement amount was denied. See Mishcon De Reya New York LLP v. \nChanBond, LLC, et al., Index No. 650575/2022 at D.I. 34 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Jan. 25, 2023). There, \nin denying the unopposed motion to seal the complaint , the New York Supreme Court explained \nthat the \"amount, which is a material fact recited in a judicial record for which the public has a \npresumptive right of access, has been public for nearly a year.\" Id. The Court finds that reasoning \npersuasive. Milhouse v. Heath, No. 14-1844, 2016 WL 9184416, at *1 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 7, 2016) \n(\"Once material is in the public domain on the public dockets of courts, there is little sound \njustification for sealing subsequent filings containing the same public domain material. \"). \nThe settlement amount and its associated information have been publicly accessible for \nmore than a year and remain in the public domain to this day. See generally Mishcon De Reya \nNew York LLP v. ChanBond, LLC, et al., Index No. 650575/2022 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). Members of \nthe public, and more pointedly , any competitors of the parties or non-parties keen on mining \nwhatever competitive information might be accessible from the settlement amount and its \nassociated information, have now long had unfettered access to it. No order of a court can un-ring \nthat bell. See In re Application of Storag Etzel GmbH, No. 19-209-CFC , 2020 WL 2949742, at \n*29 (quoting Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 144 (2d Cir. 2004) (\"We simply do \nnot have the power, even were we of the mind to use it if we had, to make what has thus become \npublic private again.\")). Accordingl y, because the settlement amount has remained public for \nmore than a year, there has been no showing that public disclosure of these particular documents \n7 disclosing the settlement amount and its associated information would work a clearly defined and \nserious injury to anyone. See Avandia, 924 F.3d at 672. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, all documents identified in footnote 3, including documents \nunder seal which disclose the settlement amount and any information in which that settlement \namount could be derived therefrom , should be unsealed. \nTherefore, at Wilmington thisl'tth day of March 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nthe Proposed Intervenors ' Motion to Intervene and Unseal Documents (D.I. 100) is GRANTED , \nand all documents identified in footnote 3 of this Memorandum Order shall be unsealed. IT IS \nFURTHER ORDERED that ChanBond 's Proposed Redactions to the Court's October 5, 2022 \nMemorandum Opinion (D.I. 157) are REJECTED and the Co 's October 5, 2022 Memorandum \nOpinion (D .I. 151) will be unsealed in its entirety. \n8 ~ \nGREGORYB.
