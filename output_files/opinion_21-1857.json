Civil Action No. 21- cv-1857- RGA \n \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n Before me is Plaintiffs \u2019 motion to strike  34 paragraphs in support of  Defendants \u2019 \ncounterclaim s pursuant to Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . (D.I. 17). For the \nfollowing reasons, Plaintiffs \u2019 motion is denied. \n Plaintiffs Dufresne Spencer Group and Dufresne Spencer Group Holdings filed a  \ncomplaint  against Defendants Han Nara Enterp rises, Richard Choi, and Aggie Choi alleging \nbreach of contractual representations and fraud pertaining to an A sset P urchase A greement  \n(\u201cAPA\u201d) . (D.I. 1). Defendants filed an answer to Plaintiffs \u2019 complaint alleging thirtee n \naffirmative defenses  as well as counterclaims for breach of promissory note and breach of \nguaranty agreement . (D.I. 10). Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike paragraphs 7- 40 in support of  \nDefendants \u2019 counterclaims  that relate in part to  Ashley Furniture Industries, Ashley Furniture \nHomeStores, and Ashley HomeStores, Ltd. (the \u201cAshley Entities\u201d) . (D.I. 17).  \n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) provides , \u201cThe court may strike from a pleading an \ninsufficient defense or any redundant, imma terial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d Fed. R. 2 \n Civ. P. 12(f). Immaterial matter \u201chas no essential or important relationship to the claim for relief \nor the defenses being pleaded,\u201d  and impertinent matter similarly \u201c consists of statements that do \nnot pertain, and are not necessary, to the issues in question.\u201d  Del.  Health Care v. MCD Holding \nCo., 893 F. Supp. 1279, 1291- 92 (D. Del. 1995)  (quoting 5A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. \nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure  \u00a7 1382, at 706- 07 (2d ed. 1990) ).1 As a general matter, \nmotions to strike are \u201c disfavored and ordinarily are denied unless the allegations have no \npossible relation to the controversy and may cause prejudice to one of the parties .\u201d Sun \nMicrosystems, Inc.  v. Versata Enters., Inc., 630 F. Supp. 2d 395, 402 (D. Del. 2009) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c [E]ven where the challenged material is redundant, \nimmaterial, impertinent, or scandalous, a motion to strike should not be granted unless the \npresence of the surplusage will prejudice the adverse party. \u201d Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Aruba \nNetworks, Inc. , 609 F. Supp. 2d 353, 359 (D. Del. 2009) . \u201cWhen faced with allegations that \ncould possibly serve to achieve a better understanding of  [the claims ] or perform any useful \npurpose in promoting the just disposition of the litigation, courts generally deny such motions to strike .\u201d Del . Health C are, 893 F. Supp. at 1292.  \n Plaintiff s argue that  because the  allegations in  the disputed paragraphs  of Defendant s\u2019 \ncounterclaim pertain  to Plaintiffs\u2019 involvement with  Ashley E ntities that bear no relation to this \nlawsuit, these allegations are immaterial and, insofar as they allude to nefarious conduct  by \nPlaintiffs , prejudicial . (D.I. 17 at  4-5). In response, Defendants assert that these allegations \u201c are \nrelated to this dispute, provide the Court with a better understanding of the claims in the dispute, \ndisclose the relationship between the parties to this dispute, and perform a useful  purpose in \n \n1 The most recent update of the treatise by Wright and Miller repeat s the quoted language. See \n5C Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure  \u00a7 1382 ( 3d ed. \n2004) . 3 \n promoting a just disposition of this dispute.\u201d  (D.I. 21 at 7). Defendants also argue that the \nallegations support its third affirmative defense alleging that Plaintiffs are barred from relief by \nthe doctrines of in pari delicto  and unclean hands . Id. at 7-8.  \n First, the Court agrees  with Defendants  that the disputed paragraphs are possibly \nmaterial.  They  allege facts  of possible relevance to Defendants\u2019 in pari delicto  and unclean \nhands affirmative defense. Plaintiffs deny the applicability of the unclean hands doctrine to this case (D.I. 24 at 2- 3), but their legal position  relies on questions of substantive  Delaware state law  \nthat I am not going to decide at this stage of the litigation. See Karpov v. Karpov , 307 F.R.D. \n345, 349 (D. Del. 2015)  (quoting Tonka Corp. v. Rose Art Indus., Inc., 836 F. Supp. 200, 218 \n(D.N.J. 1993) ) (\u201cMotions to strike are not meant to determine disputed and substantial questions \nof law .\u201d). The question here is not whether the defense is available, but whether the facts alleged \nwould be  relevant to the defense if the defense were  available. In their discussion (D. I. 17 at 3) , \nPlaintiffs  cite authority in which a court granted a motion to strike a prayer for relief because the \nnon-moving party failed to counter the moving party\u2019s  argument for striking the prayer for relief. \nDel. Health Care v. MCD Holding Co., 893 F. Supp. 1279, 1292 (D. Del. 1995) . But this \nauthority is inapposite because the court\u2019s holding there turned on the non- moving party\u2019s failure \nto respond to the moving party\u2019s  argument. Here,  Defendants have indicated the relevance of \ntheir allegations  to their third affirmative defense . (D.I. 21 at 7- 8). \nSecond, the Court rejects  Plaintiffs \u2019 contention that certain allegations by Defendants in  \nthe disputed paragraphs are prejudicial.  In their discussion (D.I. 17 at 3- 4), Plaintiffs cite \nauthority in which a court granted a motion to strike prejudicial a llegations of wrongdoing by \nindividuals who were not parties to the case. McClure v. Catholic Diocese of W ilmington , 2008 \nWL 495863, at 7* ( Del. Super. Jan. 9, 2008). But Defendants here allege wrongdoing by 4 \n Plaintiff s in connection with  the Ashley Entities , not merely wrongdoing by unrelated Ashley \nEntities.  \nPlaintiffs have not shown that Defendants\u2019  allegations are immaterial or that they will \nprejudice the Court as trier of fact . At this stage in the litigation, allegations possibly relevant to \nan affirmative  defense are not clearly immaterial . Therefore, the Court will deny Plaintiffs\u2019  \nmotion to strike.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n Entered this 6\nth day of June , 2022. \n   \n/s/ Richard G.
