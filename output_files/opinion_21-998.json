LEGAL STANDARDS  \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n574 U.S. 318, 325- 27 (2015) .  \u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have  to a person of ordinary skill \nin the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent \napplication.\u201d   Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) ( cleaned \nup).  Although \u201c the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular \nclaim terms, \u201d the context of the surrounding words of the claim also must be considered.  Id.  at \n1314.  \u201c [T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning to the ordinary artis an after reading \nthe entire patent. \u201d  Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201c is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d   Vitron ics Corp. v. Conceptronic, \nInc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201c the specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would \n \n3  The parties attached the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence to the Joint Claim Construction \nBrief itself ( see D.I. 112, Exs. 1- 53), but the Court prefers  this evidence to be submitted \nalongside the brief in the form of a joint appendix with its own  table of contents. \n4  Plaintiff  Continuous Composites  did not submit a tutorial. 4 otherwise possess.  In such case s, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs. \u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201c Even when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of \nthe patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to \nlimit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d   Hill- Rom \nServs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, I nc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201c should also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d   Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff \u2019d, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201c intrinsic evidence, \n. . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and Trademark Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\u201d   Phillips , 415 F.3d \nat 1317. \u201c [T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by \ndemonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the \ninvention in the course of prosecution, making the claim sc ope narrower than it would otherwise \nbe.\u201d  Id. \nIn some cases, courts \u201c will need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period. \u201d  Teva , 574 U.S. at 331. \nExtrinsic evidence \u201c consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d   Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201c to ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical \naspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a \nparticular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field. \u201d  5 Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201c expert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer \nfrom bias that is not present in intrinsic evidence. \u201d  Id.  Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201c may \nbe useful to the court,\u201d  it is \u201cless reliable \u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201c is unlikely \nto result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the intrinsic evidence. \u201d  Id. at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof the patented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett- Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nI. THE COURT \u2019S RULING  \nThe Court \u2019s ruling regarding the disputed claim term s of the \u2019543, \u2019798, \u2019708, \u2019109 and \n\u2019660 patents  was announced from the bench at the conclus ion of the hearing as follows:   \nAt issue there are six5 disputed claim terms in five patents.  \nI note that the parties briefed ten te rms but have since come to \nagreement on three of them.  I am prepared to rule on each of the \nremaining disputes.  I should say the parties have since come to \nagreement on three  of them and one of them was withdrawn.  I am \nprepared to  rule on each of the remaining disputes.  I will not be  \nissuing a written opinion, but I will issue an order stating my rulings.  \nI want to emphasize before I announce my decisions that although I \nam not issuing a written opinion, we have followed a full and \nthorough process before making the decisions I am about to state.  I \nhave revi ewed the patents and all evidence submitted by the parties.  \nThere  was full briefing on each of the disputed terms and we had  \nargument today.  All of that has been carefully considered.  \n \nAs to my rulings, I am not going to read into the record my \nunderstanding of claim construction law.  I have a legal standard \nsection that I have included in  earlier opinions, including somewhat \nrecently in Rex Computing, Inc. v. Cerebras Systems, Inc., C.A. No.  \n21-525 (MN).  I incorporate that law an d adopt it into my ruling \ntoday and will also set it out in the order that I  issue.  \n \n \n5  \u201cExtruder\u201d and \u201cextruding\u201d were counted together as a single term but listed separately \nabove ( supra at 2) because the two terms are different parts of speech, thereby requiring \ndifferent articulations . 6 Also, I will note that no party has suggested  that any \ndifferences in the definition of a person of ordinary skill in the art \nmake a difference here.  \n The first dispute is the meaning of \u201c extruder \u201d in claims in \nthe \u2019543, \u2019708, \u2019109 and \u2019660 patents and  \u201cextruding\u201d  in claim 17 of \nthe \u2019543 patent.  Both sides  argue that the plain and ordinary \nmeaning should apply but  dispute what that meaning is.  Plaintiff \nasserts that the  plain meaning of \u201cextruder \u201d is \u201csomething that \nextrudes \u201d and that the plain meaning of \u201c extruding \u201d is \u201cdischarging \nmaterial through an opening.\u201d  Defendant, on the other hand, argues \nthat the plain meaning of \u201c extruder \u201d is \u201ca machine that forces \nmaterial through a die or opening of appropriate  size and shape \u201d and \nthe plain meaning of \u201c extruding\u201d  is \u201cshaping or forming material by \nforcing it through a die or  opening.\u201d  I largely agree with Plaintiff.  \n The specification does not support the plain  meaning \nproposed by Defendant.  There is nothing to suggest  to a POSA that \nan \u201cextruder \u201d must be a \u201c machine\u201d  or that it must be a machine that \n\u201cforces material through \u201d anything, much less a \u201c die or opening of \nappropriate size and shape.\u201d  The same is true for the \u201c shaping or \nforming \u201d requirement  that Defendant attempts to read into \n\u201cextruding.\u201d   Indeed, Defendant first turns to extrinsic evidence in \nthe form of dictionaries to justify its constructio ns,\n[6] followed by \nreliance on an expert declaration and a different unasserted  patent \nowned by Plaintiff.  Only after that does Defendant  attempt to use \nthe intrinsic evidence.  But the parts of the  specification relied upon \nby Defendant simply explain how  primary material is held in the \nextruder and can then be  extruded out a nozzle in any flowable shape \nand, further, that the nozzle can be of different shapes.  None of that  \nrequires the extrusion process through the extruder to cause  a \nparticular shaping or forming process.  Much less a  requirement that \nsome element of propulsive force is used to discharge the extruded \nmaterial, which is also apparently  required by Defendan t\u2019s \nconstruction.  I just don\u2019 t think  that a POSA would understand the \nplain meaning of \u201c extruder \u201d or \u201cextruding\u201d  to be as articulated by \nDefendant.   I think that Plaintiff \u2019s proposal is much closer to the \nplain and ordinary meaning understood by a POSA in light of the  \nintrinsic evidence, particularly the disclosure of both pushing and \npulling being forces used to extrude material.[7]  That being said, \nPlaintiff \u2019s original proposal of \u201c extruder \u201d was not really a definition \nbut more of a circular  explanation. \n \n \n6  (D.I. 112 at 16).  \n7  (See, e.g., \u2019543 patent at 5:22- 38 & 9:57- 59). 7 I will construe the term \u201c extruder \u201d according to its plain \nmeaning, which is \u201ca structure that discharges  material. \u201d  I think \nboth parties agreed that \u201c structure \u201d is an appropriate word to use and \nI think it is better than  Plaintiff \u2019s proposed word \u201c something.\u201d   I will \nconstrue  \u201cextruding\u201d  according to i ts plain meaning, which is  \n\u201cdischarging material through an opening.\u201d  \n \nThe second term is \u201cpath, \u201d which appears in claims 17, 19, \n20, 25 and 29 of the \u2019 543 patent, claims 1, 2, 6, 13 and 14 of the \u2019 798 \npatent and claims 1, 5, 9 and 21 of  the \u2019708 patent.  Plaintiff proposes \nthat the term be given  its plain and ordinary meaning, which it \ncontends is  \u201cmaterial extruded through the extruder.\u201d  Defendant \nargues  that it should be construed to mean \u201ca coextrusion of two or  \nmore separate and distinct materials, not a pre -impregnated  material, \ncapable of extending into three dimensions.\u201d  Just yesterday , \nDefendant proposed an alternative construction \u201ctwo or more \nseparate materials extruded simultaneously to  form a composite \nmaterial allowing it to exte nd in three  dimensions rather than only \nalong horizontal planes \u201d in order to remove the negative limitation.  \n Here again, I think Defendant is reading unsupported \nlimitations into this term.  I think the attempt to read in a negative \nlimitation to exclude pre -impregnated  material is particularly \nunsupported when the specification says that \u201c [p]re -impregnating \nthe secondary material is also  envisioned.\u201d\n[8]  There is no basis in \nthe specification to find  that the patentee intended to exclude pre -\nimpregnated  materials from the scope of the claims.  Nor do I find \nany disclaimer happened during prosecution of the \u2019 543 patent.  And \nas to the capability of extending in three -dimensions, I  decline to \nread this into the construction of this term as  well.  I agree with \nPlaintiff that that capability is one of  the multiple advantages of the \ninventions but that not all  embodiments must have all of the \nadvantages .[9] \n All of that being said, I also think Plaintiff \u2019s proposal is not \nquite right either, particularly because it  is unhelpful and in some \nways circular.   Here, I think a POSA reading the intrinsic evidence \nwould understand that  the \u201cpath\u201d as claimed is  material discharged \nfrom the  extruder.  This is consistent with the use in the  \nspeci fication, where the extruder is described as  discharging \nmaterial in a path and that is often a composite  material path ( i.e., \nprimary and secondary materials).   Indeed, the Summary of \nInvention explains that \u201c [t]ogether,  the primary material and the at \n \n8  (Id. at 4:29- 30). \n9  (See, e.g., id. at 2:49- 61, 10:12- 26 & 10:29- 39). 8 least one secondary material  are called the composite material.  An \nextruder emits the  composite material in a continuous path.\u201d[10]  The \nSummary of  Invention also provides that \u201c [t]he method allows for \ntwo or  more materials [to be] simultaneously incorporated into the  \nconstruction of a path.  There is at least one primary  material and at \nleast one secondary material. . . .  These two materials are extruded \ntogether . . . .\u201d[11]  These  descriptions appear throughout the \nspecification.[12]  The specification does, however, contemplate \npaths made of only primary material in certain situations as well.[13]  \nSo I will construe \u201cpath\u201d to mean \u201cdischarged material \u201d and, to \navoid any efforts to construe my construction, I will clarify that  this \ncan encompass multiple materials being discharged  together.  That \nbeing said, I recognize that this  clarification may not be entirely \nnecessary because all the claims at issue appear to have separate \nlimitations  requiring at least two materials . \n \nThe third term is \u201c primary material, \u201d which  appears in \nclaims 17 and 25 of the \u2019543 patent, claims 1, 5, 9 and 21 of the \u2019 708 \npatent, and claim 1 of the \u2019 109 patent.  Plaintiff argues that the term \nshould be given its plain  meaning, which it says is \u201c portion of the \npath.\u201d  Defendant  argues that the term should be construed to mean \n\u201ca curable, liquid material. \u201d  I think that the dispute here is really  \nabout whether the specification clearly defines \u201cprimary  material \u201d \nas \u201ca curable liquid. \u201d  I find that it does. \n \nBeginning with the Summary of Invention, the  specification \nclearly states that \u201c [t]he primary material is  a curable liquid.\u201d[14]  \nApart from the specification reciting  something like \u201c as used herein, \n\u2018primary material \u2019 means a curable liquid,\u201d  this is as close to a \ndefinition as I can  image in these patents.  Not only is there this \ndefinitional  statement in the Summary of Invention, which Plaintiff \nhas largely ignored, the rest of the specification consistently refers \nto the \u201c primary material \u201d as a curable liquid or  mixture of curable \nliquids.[15]  Other parts of the  specification confirm that the \u201c primary \n \n10  (Id. at 2:15- 17). \n11  (Id. at 2:6 -13). \n12  (Id. at 3:33- 36, 5:3- 27 & 5:42).  \n13  (Id. at 6:15- 17 & 6:18- 29). \n14  (Id. at 2:9).  \n15  (See, e.g., id. at 2:42- 43 (\u201cThe primary material can be any liquid material suitable for \nextruding and curing\u201d); 3:28- 32 (the \u201csimplest embodiment\u201d comprises use of two 9 material \u201d must be a  liquid.  For example, the Summary of Invention \nnotes that  surface tension between primary and secondary material  \nallows for more efficient use of the primary material \u2013 this would \nnot make sense if it were not a liquid.[16]  Similarly,  the extruder is \ndescribed as being shaped to facilitate the  flow of primary \nmaterial .[17]  Again, this only makes sense to a POSA if the  primary \nmaterial is liquid because solid materials do not flow . \n \nPlaintiff argues that the specification contains  examples of \nprimary materials that are not curable liquids.   Specifically, it cites \nto column 3, lines 53 to 59 of the  \u2019543 patent, which lists \u201c [p]otential \nprimary materials \u201d and includes thermoplastics, metals and metal \nalloys.  Plaintiff  argues that thermoplastics, metals and metal alloys \nare not  curable or liquid, but has not shown that is true for all  such \nmateria ls.  And although Plaintiff cites to a statement from \nDefendant \u2019s expert that thermoplastics are not curable,  Plaintiff \u2019s \nown expert opined only that some of the examples  in the patent \n\u201cmight not be curable or liquid at room  temperature\u201d[18] and then \nreferenced the Concise Encyclopedia of  Plastics, which states that \ncuring \u201crefers to a chemical  reaction (cross -linking) or change that \noccurs during its  processing cycle.   This reaction occurs with \n[thermoset]  plastics or [thermoset] elastomers as well as cross -\nlinked [thermoplastics] that become [thermosets ].\u201d[19] \n Thus, I find nothing in the intrinsic evidence  to support a \nbroader construction \u2013 i.e., one that simply requires the primary \nmaterial be a portion of a path.  Therefore, I will construe \u201c primar y \nmaterial \u201d to mean \u201c a curable, liquid material\u201d  but note that this can \ninclude  mixtures of different curable, liquid materials . \n \n \nmaterials \u2013 i.e., liquid curable primary material and solid strand secondary material); 3:49-\n52 (\u201cSince primary materials are curable, the reservoir and means for delivery should be kept cool and dark as required to prevent curing before extrusion.\u201d); 5:45 -46 (\u201cThere are \nmany potential means of curing, which are determined by the liquid primary material.\u201d ); \n5:55- 61 (providing additional methods of curing, such as self -curing when two epoxies are \nused, other chemical curing, heat curing, etc.); see also id. at 3:64 (\u201c[T]he primary material \nmay be a combination of multiple materials.\u201d) ). \n16  (Id. at 2: 34-36). \n17  (Id. at 5:7- 8). \n18  (D.I. 112, Ex. 45 \u00b6  78). \n19  (D.I. 112, Ex. 45 \u00b6  90). 10 The fourth term is \u201canchor point \u201d from claim 17  of the \u2019 543 \npatent or \u201c anchor \u201d from claims 1, 2 and 13 of  the \u2019798 patent, and \nclaim 5 of the \u2019 708 patent and claim 4 of the \u2019 660 patent.  Plaintiff \nproposes that the terms be  construed separately and given their plain \nand ordinary meaning, which it contends is \u201c contact point to which \nthe at  least one path is adhered to enable pulling of the at least  one \npath\u201d for \u201canchor point \u201d and also \u201c contact to which the  path of \ncomposite material is adhered to enable pulling of  the path \u201d for \n\u201canchor. \u201d  Defendant proposes that the terms  be construe d together \nto mean \u201c a contact point to which the  path is affixed and that serves \nas an origin point for the  formation of the path and provides support \nfor the part  during manufacturing.\u201d   Today during argument, \nPlaintiff  agreed to the first part of Defendant \u2019s construction, so the  \ndispute is only over Defendant \u2019s addition of the words \u201c and provides \nsupport for the part during manufacturing. \u201d \n \nDefendant argues that \u201canchor \u201d and \u201canchor  point \u201d are \ncoined terms and, further, that it is just  advocating f or the \n\u201cdefinition \u201d that the PTAB adopted.  The  problem is that the PTAB \ndid not construe any claim terms in any of the IPRs.  The closes t is \nthat, during the \u2019 543 patent  institution denial, the PTAB offered a \ndescription of the  \u201canchor point \u201d as \u201ccontact  point to which the \norigin of the  at least one path is attached to enable pulling of the at  \nleast one path. \u201d[20]  But that is not a construction, particularly in light \nof the fact that the PTAB states  earlier in the decision that it \n\u201cdetermine[d] that no c laim term requires express construction for \npurposes of this  Decision. \u201d[21] \n As for providing support during manufacturing, I  think that \npart of the PTAB \u2019s discussion and Defendant \u2019s construction really \ndraws from the \u201c best mode embodiment \u201d disclosed in the \nspecification.  Beginning at column 6, line 43, the specification \ndiscusses \u201can automated  mechanical apparatus \u201d that \u201ccomprises a \nmeans of numerical  control \u201d and uses an independent computer to \nassist in the  printing process.  It is during this discussion that the  \npatent mentions the manufacturer -designated origin and the  ability \nof \u201cmultiple anchor points \u201d to provide support  during \nmanufacturing.\n[22]  Therefo re, I think that this part of  Defendant \u2019s \nconstruction is really just drawing in a  preferred embodiment . \n \n20  (D.I. 112, Ex. 26 at 12 ( PTAB  denying institution of IPR for the  \u2019543 patent )). \n21  (Id. at 7).  \n22  (See, e.g., \u2019543 patent at 8:19- 24; see also id. at 6:43- 46 (best mode embodiment comprises \na means of numerical control for nozzle location) &  8:25 (discussing numerical control \nprocessing unit as positioning the nozzle at origin) ). 11 So, I will construe this term to mean \u201c a contact  point to \nwhich the path is affixed and that serves as an  origin point for the \nformation of the path.\u201d  \n \nThe fifth term is \u201c the continuous strand being at least one of \na wire [fiber] and a fiber [wire] \u201d from  claims 1, 5, 9 and 21 of the \n\u2019708 patent and claim 1 of the  \u2019109 patent.  Plaintiff proposes that \nthe term be given its  plain and ordinary meaning, which it contends \nis \u201cthe continuous strand comprises a wire, a fiber, or both a wire  \nand a fiber. \u201d  Defendant proposes that the term be construed to mean \n\"the continuous strand being wire and fiber.\u201d   The dispute here is \nwhethe r the claimed \u201c continuous strand\u201d  must  be made of wire and \nfiber together, as Defendant contends,  or whether the \u201c continuous \nstrand \u201d can be made of wire alone, fiber alone or both wire and fiber \ntogether.  This really comes down to the meaning of \u201c at least  one \nof\u201d in the  context of the claim term.   Here, I agree with Plaintiff and  \nfind that it does not require the continuous fiber to be  made of both \nwire and fiber . \n Starting with the claim term itself, Defendant\u2019 s proposal \nrenders meaningless the patentee\u2019 s choice to recite  \u201cat least one of \u201d \nin the limitation.  Stated differently, if  Defendant \u2019s construction is \ncorrect, then the term has the  same meaning regardless of whether \n\u201cat least one of \u201d is in  the claim or not.  This suggests that \nDefendant \u2019s is not the  right construction.  Additionally, the intrinsic \nevidence  supports a construction where the continuous strand can be  \nmade of only wire, only fiber or a combination of both.  As recited \nin the claims at issue, the \u201c continuous strand\u201d  is material  that is \n\u201cencased in a primary material. \u201d  The Summary of Invention \nexplains that secondary material \u201c is a solid strand\u201d  that \u201cmay be any \nmaterial \u201d and encased within  the primary material.\n[23]  The \nsecondary and primary material  form a composite material that is \nextruded in a continuous  path.  The best mode for the secondary \nmaterial solid strand  is described as carbon fiber,[24] which suggests \nto a POSA that  that continuous strand can be fiber alone.  Later, the  \nSummary of Invention also explains that \u201c [t]he secondary material \ncan be any material in the form of a strand.   Examples of potential \nsecondary materials include carbon  fiber, fiber optics, metal wire, or \na hollow rubber tube.\u201d[25]  This again suggests to a POSA that the \nstrand of secondary material can be fiber alone but also can be wire alone.  The Summary of Invention goes even further to explain that  \n \n23  (\u2019708 patent at 2:26 -30). \n24  (Id. at 2:27- 28). \n25  (Id. at 2:59- 62). 12 the secondary material may be a combination of materials \u2013 i.e., \nincluding any com bination that I just mentioned,  including fiber and \nwire together.[26]  Thus, a POSA reading this would understand that \nthe claimed \u201ccontinuous strand\u201d  is not limited to being made up of \nboth fiber and wire, as  Defendant contends.  Other portions of the \nspecification  similarly support a construction that permits the  \n\u201ccontinuous stand\u201d  to be fiber, wire or both.[27]  I am also not  \npersuaded that anything that happened during prosecution amounts \nto a clear and unmistakable disclaimer of strands  comprised of  only \nwire or fiber alone.  In light of this  intrinsic evidence, a POSA would \nunderstand that the term  \u201cthe continuous strand being at least one of \na wire [fiber]  and a fiber [wire] \u201d means \u201cthe continuous strand \ncomprises a wire, a fiber, or both a wire and a fiber. \u201d \n \nThe sixth term is \u201c harden \u201d / \u201chardened \u201d / \u201chardening\u201d  from \nclaims 25 of the \u2019 543 patent, claims 5, 9 and 21 of the \u2019 708 patent, \nclaim 13 of the \u2019 798 patent and claim 1 of the \u2019 660 patent.  Once \nagain, the parties are  fighting about the plain meaning of the terms.  \nPlaintiff  argues that the plain meaning is simply \u201c to make harder. \u201d  \nDefendant, on the other hand, separates the terms into two, arguing \nthat the plain meaning of \u201c hardened \u201d is \u201cmade stronger as the result \nof curing\u201d  and that the plain meaning of \u201chardening\u201d  is \n\u201cstrengthening a material by curing.\u201d   The  dispute here is twofold \u2013  \nfirst, whether the harden terms  require a change in strength in the \nmaterial and, second,  whether that change in strength must come \nfrom curing.  \n At this point, I am not convince d this term  requires \nconstruction beyond what I am about to say.  Based  on the intrinsic \nevidence, I do not think that there is  support  to read in the strength \nlimitation offered by  Defendant.  It didn\u2019 t even really explain the \nreasoning behind that \u2013 whether intrinsic or extrinsic \u2013 in the  \nbriefing and offered little more today at argument.  I am  also not \nconvinced that a POSA would unde rstand \u201ccuring\u201d  to be a necessary \npart of the meaning of this term, particularly when some claims \nrecite hardening as the result  of curing (or cure energy)\n[28] and others \n \n26  (Id. at 2:62- 63). \n27  (See, e.g., id. at 4:29- 31 (\u201cFIG. 1 shows multiple examples of possible secondary materials.  \nIncluded are carbon fiber, fiber optics, metal wire, and rubber.\u201d); 4:59 -61 (\u201cThe secondary \nmaterial may be composed of multiple materials itself, as long as it maintains its strand form.\u201d)).  \n28  (See, e.g., claim 13 of the \u2019798 patent) . \n 13 \nrecite hardening  without any mention of curing at all.[29]  Therefore, \nI reject  Defendant \u2019s proposed definition and do not think that  further \nconstruction is necessary at this point .  I think that resolves our \ndisputes over the  claim scope and a jury can understand the meaning \nof the  \u201charden\u201d  terms without further definition . \n \n \n \n              \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge  \n \n \n29  (See, e.g., claim 25 of the \u2019543 patent) .
