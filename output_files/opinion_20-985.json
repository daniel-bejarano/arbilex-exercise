BACKGROUND \nThe asserted patents share a common specification. These patents are directed to \ncapsules containing 34 mg of pimavanserin. (' 480 patent, 1 :65-67). Pimavanserin is the active \ningredient in Nuplazid \u00ae, which is \"approved for treatment of hallucinations and delusions \nassociated with Parkinson 's disease psychosis at a dose of 34 mg.\" (Id., 1 :22-25). Nuplazid \u00ae \nwas originally a 17 mg tablet formulation , which required patients to take two tablets daily. (D.I. \n138, Ex. 2, at 2). Plaintiff then developed the 34 mg formulation ofNuplazid \u00ae as disclosed in \nthe asserted patents, which allows patients to take one capsule daily. (Id., Ex. 3, at 2). \nThe following claims are most relevant for purposes of this Markman , and I have \nitalicized the disputed terms: \nClaims 14 and 20 of the '480 patent \n14. A pharmaceuticall y acceptable capsule for orally delivering 34 mg of pimavanserin to \na patient, wherein the capsule has a size 3 or 4 capsule shell that contains a blended \npimavanserin composition comprising: \n40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate wherein the bulk density of the granulated \npimavanserin tartrate of 0.4 g/ml to 0.6 g/ml as determined by USP<616>, method 1; a \nfiller and optionally a lubricant. \n1 At argument, there seemed to be an understanding that the '185 patent had dropped out of the \ncase (see D.I. 145 at 6-7), but the record appears to reflect that the '185 patent is still asserted \nagainst one Defendant group-Zydus and Cadila (see D.I. 151 at 2 ,r 3). \n1 20. The pharmaceutically acceptable capsule of claim 14, wherein the granulated \npimavanserin has a Carr's index of 24 as determined by USP<l 174>. \nClaim 8 of the '891 patent \n8. A pharmaceutically acceptable capsule for orally delivering 5-34 mg of pimavanserin \nto a patient, wherein the capsule contains a blended pimavanserin composition comprising: \ngranulated pimavanserin or a pharmaceuticall y acceptable salt thereof, wherein the bulk \ndensity of the granulated pimavanserin or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is O .4 \ng/ml to 0.6 g/ml as determined by USP<616>, method 1; a filler and optionally a lubricant. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) ( en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted). '\" [T]here is no magic formula or \ncatechism for conducting claim construction. ' Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate \nweight to appropriate sources 'in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\"' \nSoftView LLC v. Apple Inc., 2013 WL 4758195 , at *l (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (quoting Phillips, \n415 F.3d at 1324) (alteration in original). When construing patent claims, a court considers the \nliteral language of the claim, the patent specification , and the prosecution history. Markman v. \nWestview Instruments , Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 977-80 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 \n(1996). Of these sources, \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction \nanalysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\" \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning .... \n[Which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in \nquestion at the time of the invention , i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application. \" \nId. at 1312-13 ( citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he ordinary meaning of a \nclaim term is its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\" Id. at 1321 \n2 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as \nunderstood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim \nconstruction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted \nmeaning of commonly understood words.\" Id. at 1314. \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evidence-the patent claims, the \nspecification , and the prosecution history-the court's construction is a determination oflaw. \nSee Teva Phann. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318,331 (2015). The court may also make \nfactual findings based upon consideration of extrinsic evidence , which \"consists of all evidence \nexternal to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony , \ndictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Phillips, 415 F .3d at 1317-19 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Extrinsic e vidence may assist the court in understanding the underlying technology , \nthe meaning of terms to one skilled in the art, and how the invention works. Id. Extrinsic \nevidence, however, is less reliable and less useful in claim construction than the patent and its \nprosecution history. Id. \nIII. CONSTRUCTION OF AGREED-UPON TERMS \nI adopt the following agreed-upon constructions: \nClaim Term Construction \n\"a blended pimavanserin composition \" ( claim \"a mixture of pharmaceutical ingredients \n1 ofthe '185 patent; claims 1, 5, 12, and 14 of including pimavanserin or a pharmaceuticall y \nthe '480 patent; and claims 1 and 8 of the acceptable salt thereof and one or more \n'891 patent) excipients mixed together\" \n\"the blended pimavanserin composition \" The term \"the blended pimavanserin \n(claims 3, 6, 7, 12, and 16 of the '480 patent; composition \" refers to the term \"a blended \nclaims 7 and 11 of the '891 patent) pimavanserin composition \" which is recited \nin the same claim or in a parent claim \n3 IV. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS \n1. \"40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" (claim 1 of the '185 patent; claims 1, \n5, 12, and 14 of the '480 patent; claim 1 of the '891 patent) \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: \"granulation resulting from an act or process in \nwhich particles, including 40 mg pimavanserin tartrate, are made to adhere to \nform larger, multiparticle entities\" \nb. Defendants ' proposed construction: \"40 mg pimavanserin tartrate granulated \nalone\" \nc. Court's construction: \"40 mg pimavanserin tartrate granulated alone\" \nThe central dispute between the parties is whether the claimed pimavanserin tartrate2 can \nbe granulated with excipients or whether it must be granulated alone. This dispute depends on \nwhether prosecution history disclaimer applies. Prosecution history disclaimer \"requires that the \nalleged disavowing actions or statements made during prosecution be both clear and \nunmistakable. \" Omega Eng'g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1325-26 (Fed. Cir. 2003).3 \n\"[A]n applicant's argument that a prior art reference is distinguishable on a particular ground can \nserve as a disclaimer of claim scope even if the applicant distinguishes the reference on other \ngrounds as well.\" Saffran v. Johnson & Johnson, 712 F.3d 549, 559 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (quoting \nAndersen Corp. v. Fiber Composites, LLC, 474 F.3d 1361, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2007)). \nDefendants argue that the patentee clearly and unmistakably disclaimed pimavanserin \ntartrate granulated with excipients during the prosecution of the relevant patents. (D.I. 137 at \n2 \"Forty milligrams of the pimavanserin tartrate is the same as 34 milligrams of pimavanserin.\" \n(D.I. 145 at 59:4-5). \n3 I wonder whether something could be unmistakable without also being clear or clear without \nbeing unmistakable. In Omega, the Court of Appeals quoted cases using \"clear\" or \"clear and \nunambiguous \" as the basis for the \"both clear and unmistakable\" standard. In probably hundreds \nof cases arguing about whether there was prosecution disclaimer , I do not think anyone has ever \nargued that the alleged disclaimer, even if clear, was not unmistakable. Nor has anyone ever \nargued that even if the alleged disclaimer were unmistakable, it was not clear. \n4 24--29). Plaintiff argues that the statements made by the patentee were ambiguous and do not \nmeet the high burden required to trigger the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer. (Id. at 45--48). I \nagree with Defendants. The prosecution history here is clear. The patentee repeatedly and \nunambiguously disclaimed pimavanserin tartrate granulated with excipients. \nDuring the prosecution of the '185 patent, 4 the examiner rejected all pending claims as \nobvious partly because U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0264330 (\"the '330 Application \") \ndisclosed an oral formulation comprising pimavanserin tartrate where \"[t]he granulated drug has \na bulk density of about 0.56 g/ml.\" (D.I. 125-4, Ex. D, at 3). This bulk density was within the \nclaimed range of 0.4 to 0.6 g/ml. Before providing a written response , the patentee presented \nslides detailing the claimed invention to the examiner. (D.I. 125-8, Ex. H). The patentee's \npresentation included the following slide. (Id. at 5). \nKey Inventive Points \n\u2022 Pimavanserin tartrate can surprisingly be granulated ( without use of large amounts of excipients, i.e. \nonly water) to achieve: \na) novel granulated pimavanserin having a high bulk density of 0.4 to 0.6 g/ml of the granulated \ndrug alone; \nb) a particle size distribution of 180 to 340 \u00b5m of the granulated drug alone \n\u2022 Using the novel granulated pimavanserln tartrate, with 0.4 to 0.6 g/ml bulk density and 180 to 340 \u00b5m \nparticle size distribution, the inventive blended pimavanserin compositions have significantly lower \nweight percentage of exdpients as compared to prior art \n\u2022 Contrast to well-understood formulation art that requires significant amounts of excipients with the \nactive during granulation to achieve a higher density granulation formulation, thus requiring a very \nlarge volume of composition to deliver 34 mg of pimavanserin \n\u2022 The final formulation also includes exciplent (e.g., mlcrocrystalline cellulose having high bulk density as \nin the novel granulated pimavanserin \n4 It is undisputed that the '185 patent's prosecution history applies equally to the '480 and '891 \npatents. (See D.I. 145 at 55:19-25) ; Elkay Mfg. Co. v. Ebco Mfg. Co., 192 F.3d 973, 980 (Fed. \nCir. 1999) (\"When multiple patents derive from the same initial application, the prosecution \nhistory regarding a claim limitation in any patent that has issued applies with equal force to \nsubsequently issued patents that contain the same claim limitatio n.\"). \n5 The patentee also provided the following table, which shows that the bulk density of the \nAPI used in the '330 Application is lower than the pimavanserin granulation of the claimed \ninvention. (Id. at 6). \nPlmavan!!!in gr.inulatlon !is !!\u2022&\u00b7, instant~ Natiw API (e.g., as used in prior art) \nelalmedl \nBulk density (81ml) according to USP <616> 0.508(n=4) 0.294(n=2) \nThe patentee explained , \"[T]he '330 Application starts with non-granulated pimavanserin \nwith low density, in contrast to the claimed novel granulated pimavanserin. \" (Id.). The patentee \nfurther explained , \"Achieving the claimed pimavanserin bulk density and particle size, without \nother excipients , was unpredictable and unexpected .\" (Id. at 9). These statements tend to show \nthat the bulk density reported in the above table was the bulk density of the granulated \npimavanserin tartrate alone. \nPlaintiff argues that a POSA reading this presentation would understand that the claimed \npimavanserin tartrate granulation allows minimal excipients , as compared to the significant \namount of excipients used in the prior art. (D.I. 145 at 24: 18-25 :3). I disagree. Throughout this \npresentation, the patentee distinguishes the '330 Application by asserting that the claimed \ninvention achieves the claimed high bulk density of the pimavanserin tartrate alone. The \npatentee is able to achieve this high bulk density of the API alone because it granulates the API \nalone. (See, e.g., '480 patent, 10:55-59 (describing the \"finding that pimavanserin could be \nsuccessfully wet granulated achieving the targeted imp[ro ]ved physical properties ( e.g. bulk \ndensity) without the addition of a binder\" as \"surprising \"). The high bulk density then allows \nfewer excipients to be added to the blended pimavanserin composition , which in turn results in a \nformulation that provides 34 mg of the drug in one small capsule. (D.I. 125-8, Ex. H, at 4 \n(\"Discovered a formulation that could provide large amount (34 mg) of pimavanserin in a small \n6 volume (e.g., size 3 or 4 capsule). \"); id. at 5 (\"Using the novel granulated pimavanserin tartrate, \nwith 0.4 to 0.6 g/ml bulk density and 180 to 340 \u00b5m particle size distribution , the inventive \nblended pimavanserin compositions have significantly lower weight percentage of excipients as \ncompared to prior art.\")). \nThe patentee made the same arguments in its written office action response. The patentee \nexplained that its \"instant claimed invention\" is \"a small capsule having a high bulk density of \n0.4 to 0.6 g/mL pimavanserin (drug alone) that eases swallowing while delivering a full 34 mg of \ndrug.\" (D.I. 125-5, Ex. E, at 4). The patentee again distinguished the '330 Application , arguing, \n\"Example 9 (and Table 8) of the '330 Application , which is representative , includes low-density \npimavanserin , and requires ~80% w/w of the excipients mannitol , starch, povidone , and \nmagnesium stearate to achieve a bulk density of 0.56 Og/mL of a formulation ofpimavanserin \n(and not pimavanserin alone).\" (Id. at 5). The patentee argued that the examiner failed to \nestablish a prima facie case of obviousness because \"there is no finding that one of skill in the art \nwould have been motivated ... to obtain the high density of pimavanserin alone.\" (Id. at 6; see \nalso id. at 4-5 (\"[T]here was no reasonable expectation at the time of the instant invention that \nobtaining such high bulk density of pimavanserin itself, to obtain a capsule that includes 34 mg \nof the drug, was achievable. \")).5 \n5 The patentee made similar arguments during the prosecution of the '480 patent-a continuation \nof the '185 patent. (See, e.g., D.I. 125-10, Ex. J, at 5 (describing the claimed invention as \"a \nsmall capsule having a high bulk density of 0.4 to 0.6 g/mL pimavanserin (drug alone)\"); id. \n(\"[T]here was no reasonable expectation at the time of the instant invention that obtaining such \nhigh bulk density of pimavanserin itself, to obtain a capsule that includes 34 mg of the drug, was \nachievable. \"); D.I. 125-14, Ex. N, at 2 (examiner 's summary of applicant -initiated interview ) \n(\"Applicant argues that the claimed compound has a higher bulk density which allows for more \nof the drug to be granulated and fit into a smaller space, while the drug of the prior art requires \nother ingredients in the granulation which increases the space required.\"); D.I. 125-15, Ex. 0, at \n5 (\"Pimavanserin tartrate itself can surprisingl y be granulated (without use of large amounts of \n7 Again, the patentee clearly states that the claimed invention achieves the claimed high \nbulk density of the pimavanserin tartrate alone, while the prior art achieved the same bulk \ndensity using excipients. Yet, Plaintiff argues that some of the patentee's statements are \nambiguous . For example, Plaintiff argues that it is unclear whether the references to the \ngranulated \"drug\" alone refer to the granulated pimavanserin itself or the granulated \npimavanserin in the presence of excipients. (D.I. 137 at 48; D.I. 145 at 45:13-25). But viewing \nthese statements in context, it is clear that the references to the granulated \"drug\" alone refer to \nthe granulated pimavanserin itself. The patentee describes the \"instant claimed invention \" as \"a \nsmall capsule having a high bulk density of O. 4 to O. 6 g/rn.L pimavanserin ( drug alone) that eases \nswallowing while delivering a full 34 mg of drug.\" (D.I. 125-5, Ex. E, at 4). The reference to \n\"34 mg of drug\" is clearly referring to the pimavanserin alone. (D.I. 145 at 46: 1-5). Thus, a \nPOSA would understand that the reference to \"pimavanserin ( drug alone)\" also refers to the \npimavanserin alone. \nWhile there are statements in the prosecution history that by themselves do not rise to the \nlevel of clear and unmistakable disclaimer , 6 I find that there is clear and unmistakable disclaimer \nwhen considering the prosecution history as a whole. See Elkay Mfg. Co. v. Ebco Mfg. Co., 192 \nF.3d 973,979 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\"[I]t is the totality of the prosecution history that must be \nexcipients/binders , i.e. only water) to achieve: a novel granulated pimavanserin tartrate having a \nhigh bulk density of 0.4 to 0.6 g/rnl of the granulated drug alone.\")). \n6 For example, the first bullet point on the \"Key Inventive Points\" slide provides, \"Pimavanserin \ntartrate can surprisingly be granulated (without use of large amounts of excipients, i.e. only \nwater).\" (D.I. 125-8, Ex. H, at 5). I agree with Plaintiff that this isolated statement is \nambiguous. Plaintiff argues: \"If only water was to be used during granulation, the previous \nphrase would have been 'without any excipients' and not 'without use of large amounts of \nexcipients.\"' (D.I. 137 at 48; see D.I. 145 at 69:19-70:3). On the other hand, this statement, \nwhich is about how surprising the result is, suggests not a modest change-less excipients-but \na large change, that is, \"only water.\" Thus, the bullet point by itself is ambiguous. \n8 assessed, not the individual segments of the presentation made to the Patent and Trademark \nOffice by the applicant .... \"). Throughout the prosecution history, the patentee makes clear that \nthe claimed granules having the required bulk density are granules of the API alone. (See, e.g., \nD.I. 125-5, Ex. E, at 4 (\"high bulk density of ... pimavanserin (drug alone)\"); id. at 5 (\"high \nbulk density of pimavanserin itself'); id. at 6 (\"high density of pimavanserin alone\"); D.I. 125-8, \nEx. H, at 5 (\"high bulk density of ... the granulated drug alone\"); D.I. 125-10, Ex. J, at 5 (\"high \nbulk density of ... pimavanserin (drug alone)\"); id. (\"high bulk density of pimavanserin itself')). \nFurther, the patentee distinguishes the prior art on this basis. (See, e.g., D.I. 125-5, Ex. E, at 5). \nThis disavowal in claim scope is unequivocal and unambiguous. 7 \nDefendants ' construction is also supported by the claim language. Claim 1 of the '480 \npatent, for example, recites: \"40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate wherein the bulk density of \nthe granulated pimavanserin tartrate is 0.4 to 0.6 g/ml as determined by USP<616>, method 1.\" \nIt is undisputed that \"40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" refers to the amount of API in the \nclaimed \"blended pimavanserin composition. \" (D.I. 137 at 11; D.I. 145 at 13:1--4, 56:13-15 ). \n7 Plaintiff argues that the examiner 's stated reasons for allowance for the patents \"reflect an \nunderstanding that the claimed inventions are concerned with fitting the total daily dose of 40 mg \npimavanserin tartrate into a smaller size 3 or 4 capsule and not towards any particular process for \ngranulation or select embodiment. \" (D .I. 13 7 at 13 ). For example, in the notice of allowance for \nthe '185 patent, the examiner states, \"The instantly claimed, granulated pimavanserin \nformulation allows for minimal excipients , and compaction into smaller dosage forms to ease \ndelivery by oral delivery.\" (D.I. 125-7, Ex. G, at 6). This statement is consistent with the \npatentee's disclaimer. The patentee discovered that by granulating the pimavanserin tartrate \nalone, the need for excipients in the final formulation was reduced , thereby allowing a greater \namount of pimavanserin to fit into a smaller volume. Regardless , statements by the examiner \ncannot erase a patentee's clear and unmistakable disclaimer. See Fenner lnvs., Ltd. v. Cellco \nP'ship, 778 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (\"[T]he interested public has the right to rely on the \ninventor's statements made during prosecution , without attempting to decipher whether the \nexaminer relied on them, or how much weight they were given.\"); Comput. Docking Station \nCorp. v. Dell, Inc., 519 F.3d 1366, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\"[T]he examiner 's citation of the \nsingle connection limitation in the reasons for allowability does not erase the applicants ' clear \ndisavowal of laptops.\"). \n9 Thus, the claimed bulk density of \"the granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" is the bulk density of \nthe API alone, measured using the claimed method. Plaintiff's expert and Defendants' expert \nI \nagree that USP<616>, method I measures the bulk density of the solid material being tested. \n(See D.I. 138, Ex. 5,, 44; id., Ex. 8,, 58). For example, if a POSA is testing a mixture (e.g., \npimavanserin and excipients ), the resulting measurement will be the bulk density of the mixture, \nnot the bulk density of the individual components. (See D.I. 145 at 157:14-16). \nPlaintiff's expert Dr. Klibanov states, \"[A] POSA would have understood that any bulk \ndensity measurement performed on pimavanserin granulations, including pimavanserin and other \ningredients , could be used to determine with a certain degree of confidence the bulk density of \nthe pimavanserin.\" (D.I. 138, Ex. 8,, 58). Dr. Klibanov further states, \"[A] POSA would have \nbeen aware of analytical methods to determine the attributes of components , including image \nanalysis of sieve fractions and microscopic techniques. \" (Id.). But this is not what the claims \nrequire. The claims require determining the bulk density of the API alone using USP<616 >, \nmethod 1, not measuring the bulk density of a mixture of API and excipients and then using \n\"analytical methods\" to determine the bulk density of the API alone. A POSA would understand \nthat in order to measure the bulk density of the pimavanserin tartrate alone using USP<616 >, \nmethod I-as required by the claims-the pimavanserin tartrate must be granulated alone. (See \nid., Ex. 5, ,, 44-45). \nDefendants ' construction is further supported by the specification. The only detailed \ndescription of the \"Granulation \" process in the specification describes granulating pimavanserin \ntartrate alone. (See '480 patent, 20:20-45; see also id., 15:8-10 (\"[I]t was surprisingly found \nthat a I 00% pimavanserin high-shear granulation was possible by using only small water \n10 quantities .... \");8 16:25-30 (\"One embodiment of the compositions described herein includes \npimavanserin tartrate granulation without binder, dried, and thereafter blended with less than \n60% w/w microcrystalline cellulose such as A vicel PH302 or equivalent microcrystalline \ncellulose , and about 1 % w/w magnesium stearate.\")). Although the specification contains other \nembodiments that permit granulation with excipients, this does not change the result. (See id., \n17:36--51 ). As discussed above, Plaintiff disavowed that subject matter during prosecution of the \nrelevant patents. Biogen Idec, Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKlin e LLC, 713 F.3d 1090, 1095 (Fed. Cir. \n2013) (\"[W]hen the patentee unequivocall y and unambiguousl y disavows a certain meaning to \nobtain a patent, the doctrine of prosecution history disclaimer narrows the meaning of the claim \nconsistent with the scope of the claim surrendered .\").9 \nI therefore adopt Defendants ' proposed construction. \n2. \"the granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" (claims 1, 5, 12, 14, and 15 of the '480 \npatent; claim 1 of the '891 patent) \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: The term \"the granulated pimavanserin \ntartrate\" refers to the term \"40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" which is \nrecited in the same claim or in a parent claim. \nb. Defendants ' proposed construction: \"the pimavanserin tartrate that has been \ngranulated alone\" \nc. Court's construction : The term \"the granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" refers to \nthe term \"40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" which is recited in the same \nclaim or in a parent claim. \n8 The sentence goes on, but the remainder of the sentence does not make much sense. \n9 Plaintiff also argues that because claim 13 of the '891 patent recites granulation \"without \naddition of a binder,\" the independent claim must include a binder or other excipient. (D.I. 137 \nat 62). This argument , however, does not change the result here because there is prosecution \nhistory disclaimer. Biogen Idec , 713 F.3d at 1097 (\"Our cases make clear, however, that where \nfound, prosecution history disclaimer can overcome the presumption of claim differentiation. \"). \n11 3. \"the granulated pimavanserin\" (claim 1 of the '185 patent; claim 20 of the '480 \npatent) \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: The term \"the granulated pimavanserin \" refers \nto the term \"40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" which is recited in the same \nclaim or in a parent claim. \nb. Defendants ' proposed construction: \"the pimavanserin that has been granulated \nalone\" \nc. Court's construction: The term \"the granulated pimavanserin \" refers to the term \n\"40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate\" which is recited in the same claim or in \na parent claim. \nTerms 2 and 3 both have antecedent basis in the term \"40 mg granulated pimavanserin \ntartrate.\" For term 3 specifically, the only \"granulated pimavanserin \" recited in claim 1 of the \n'185 patent and claim 14 of the '480 patent is the \"40 mg granulated pimavanserin tartrate.\" \nThus, a POSA would clearly understand that the term '\"the granulated pimavanserin \" in claim 1 \nof the '185 patent and claim 20 of the '480 patent refers to the term \"40 mg granulated \npimavanserin tartrate\" in claim 1 of the '185 patent and claim 14 of the '480 patent, respectively. \n4. \"granulated pimavanserin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof' ( claim \n8 of the '891 patent) \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction : \"granulation resulting from an act or process in \nwhich particles, including pimavanserin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt \nthereof, are made to adhere to form larger, multiparticle entities\" \nb. Defendants ' proposed construction: \"pimavanserin or a pharmaceutically \nacceptable salt granulated alone\" \nc. Court's construction : \"pimavanserin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt \ngranulated alone\" \nThe parties' constructions for this term mirror their constructions for \"40 mg granulated \npimavanserin tartrate.\" Thus, for the reasons discussed above, I adopt Defendants' construction. \nThe above constructions are so ordered. \n12 "}
