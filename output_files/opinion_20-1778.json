Andrews", "date": "01-11-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nABDUL-HAQQ SHABAZZ , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nPEPPER HAMIL TON, LLP, et al., \nDefendants . : Civ. No. 20-1778-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 11th day of January, 2022; \nIT IS ORDERED that (1) Plaintiffs request for counsel (D.I. 17) is DENIED \nwithout prejudice ; (2) Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint on or before February 28, \n2022; the failure to do so will result in the closing of the case; and (3) there will be no \nfurther extensions. \nPlaintiff, an inmate at Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown , Delaware , \nseeks counsel on the grounds that his complaint must be liberally construed , I was \ninvolved in a prior lawsuit filed by Plaintiff, Plaintiff is involved in a different case that is \nschedule to start trial on January 18, 2022, 1 and Plaintiff has no one to assist him with \nhis case. (D.I. 17). I previously denied a request for counsel on November 5, 2021. \n(See D.I. 16). \n1 The trial date in that case has been continued. See Shabazz v. Delaware Dep't of \nCarree., Civ. A. No. 16-570-RGA at D.I. 225 (D. Del.). \n1 A prose litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or statutory \nright to representation by counsel. See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d \nCir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147,153 (3d Cir. 1993). However, representation \nby counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a finding that a \nplaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155. \nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of \nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in \ndeciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the \nmerits of the plaintiff's claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her case \nconsidering his or her education , literacy, experience , and the restraints placed upon \nhim or her by incarceration ; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to \nwhich factual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue such \ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiff's capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and \n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony. \nSee Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at \n155-56. The list is not exhaustive , nor is any one factor determinative . Tabron, 6 F.3d \nat 157. \nPlaintiff is a blind elderly prisoner. He has no pending complaint , as I dismissed \nthe complaint he filed for three reasons, including that some of the claims were \nfrivolous, some of the claims were against defendants who were immune from suit, and \nsome of the claims did not state a claim. (0.1. 10). I gave him leave to amend. There \nhas been no amended complaint , but Plaintiff has requested more time (0.1. 13, 0.1. \n2 15), which I granted him. I know from other litigation he has that he has been ill. But \nthe second extension of time has run out, and there has been no amended complaint. \nInstead, at the deadline, he filed a document styled, \"In response to: Memorandum \nOrder.\" (D.I. 17). \nIn that pleading, Plaintiff again requests appointment of counsel. The threshold \nissue for appointment of counsel is that there be a claim that has arguable merit in fact \nand law. Right now, Plaintiff does not meet that requirement. There are no pending \nclaims, as I have dismissed them all. \nI also note from the record as a whole that it may be the case that Plaintiffs main \ndesire is to file a claim for legal malpractice against the lawyers I appointed to represent \nhim in another case. (See in particular 0.1. 11 ). If this is the claim, it is doubtful that I \nwould even have original jurisdiction over the claim, as it is a state law claim and would \nrequire diversity of citizenship. Plaintiff is certainly a citizen of Delaware. There are \nno allegations about the citizenship of the law firm and its lawyers, at least some of \nwhom are members of the Delaware Bar. But, even assuming that a malpractice claim \ncould be stated, it is extremely unlikely I would appoint Plaintiff a lawyer for a tort suit \nsuch as a legal (or medical) malpractice claim. Most individuals who bring represented \nmedical or legal malpractice claims do so on a contingency basis. It is one thing to \nappoint a lawyer to represent Plaintiff if he has a section 1983 or other federal claim. \nBut if Plaintiff cannot obtain a lawyer who is willing to represent him on a contingency \nbasis for a state law claim of the kind that is usually handled in state court on a \n3 contingency basis, there is little to no reason why I should seek to use the limited \nresources available through the CJA panel to do that. \nI also note Plaintiff's requests for various orders directing the prison to change \nthe rules for Plaintiff, including assigning him an assistant and to allow him to select an \nindividual outside the prison to handle his typing and to act on his behalf. (D.I. 17 at 4). \nIn essence, Plaintiff asks the Court to involve itself in the administrat ion of a state \nprison. Prison officials require broad discretionary authority as the \"operation of a \ncorrectional institution is at best an extraordinarily difficult undertaking .\" Wolff v. \nMcDonnell , 418 U.S. 539, 566 (1974). The federal courts are not overseers of the day\u00ad\nto-day management of prisons, and I will not interfere with the Department of Correction \nby ordering it to provide Plaintiff with the special treatment he seeks. \nAccordingly , the Court will deny without prejudice Plaintiff's request for counsel \nand will give him one final extension to file an amended complaint. \n4 "}
