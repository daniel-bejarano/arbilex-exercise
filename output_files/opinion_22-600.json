HALL, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\neT SE SS AS SS SS\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDavid Q. Webb, Newark, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nSeptember 2% , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nCul\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPlaintiff David Q. Webb commenced this action on May 3, 2022. (D.I. 2)\nHe appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I.\n4) Pending is Plaintiff's request for electronic notification. (D.I. 5) The Court\nproceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(b).\n\nL BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d\nCir. 2008). The claims concern Plaintiffs automobile accident, his attorney\u2019s\nrefusal to provide proper legal representation, and his insurers refusal to provide\nproper policy coverage. (D.I. 2)\n\nPlaintiff alleges violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7$\u00a7 2000d er seq. He also raises claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, alleges\nDefendants violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and raises supplemental state\nclaims for legal malpractice, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and\nvicarious liability.\n\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Bail v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\nforma pauperis actions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a\ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.\nPhillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is\nliberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to\nless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling\non Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\n\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\n3\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Title VI\n\nCount I raises a claim under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. The count fails to set forth plausible claims. Count J alleges that\nPhillips, McLaughlin & Hall, P.A. is a recipient of federal funds through the\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan program and that it, and its employees,\nengaged in intentional discrimination when it refused to properly provide Plaintiff\nlegal representation as that afforded to white citizens in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n20004, et seq. Exhibit 1 of the Complaint is an email authored by Plaintiff that\nstates he terminated his legal relationship with Phillips, McGlaughlin, & Hall\nbecause he did \u201cnot feel through ten months of legal representation [its]\nconcentration [did not] match the needs of [Plaintiff's] case.\u201d (DI. 2-1 at 4)\n\nCount I is pled in a conclusory manner. Moreover, there are no factual\nallegations that provide a plausible basis to conclude that Phillips, McGlaughlin, &\n\nHall intentionally discriminated against Plaintiff because of Plaintiffs race, color\n4\nand/or national origin in violation of Title VI. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d; Alexander\nv. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001). Notably, Exhibit 1 indicates that\nPlaintiff terminated his legal relationship with Phillips, McLaughlin & Hall\nbecause its legal representation did not meet the needs of Plaintiff's case. It makes\nno reference to discrimination of any kind. Count I will be dismissed for failure to\nstate a claim. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend Count I.\n\nB. 42U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n\nCount II raises a claim against Phillips, McLaughlin & Hall and James P.\nHall under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 for violating the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution when they did not provide Plaintiff proper legal representation\nafforded to white citizens following Plaintiffs automobile accident in accordance\nwith contingency contract agreement. It alleges that Defendants National General\nInsurance Company, Zurich American Insurance Company, Copart, Incorporated,\nSedgwick Claims Management Services, Incorporated, and Amazon.com,\nIncorporated did not provide the same proper insurance coverage for an African\nAmerican male (i.e., Plaintiff) as it provided to white citizens insured by them in\naccordance with the insurance contracts and that they intentionally discriminated\nagainst Plaintiff by denying proper insurance coverage under the insurance\n\ncontracts.\nTo state a claim under section 1981, a plaintiff must allege facts supporting:\n\u201c(1) that plaintiff is a member of a racial minority; (2) intent to discriminate on the\nbasis of race by the defendant; and (3) discrimination concerning one or more of\nthe activities enumerated by the statute, which includes the right to make and\nenforce contracts.\u201d Brown v. Philip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001)\n(cleaned up).\n\nPlaintiff alleges in a conclusory manner without supporting facts an intent to\ndiscriminate on the basis of race. In addition, the Complaint\u2019s numerous exhibits\ndo not reference discrimination of any kind. Accordingly, Count II will be\ndismissed. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend the claim.\n\nC. 42U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n\nCounts III, IV, and V attempt to raise claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \u201cTo\nstate a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured\nby the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged\ndeprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d See West\nv. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\n\nThe claims fail as a matter of law. No Defendant is a state actor acting\nunder the color of state law \u2014 a necessary element to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.\nTherefore, Counts III, IV, and V will be dismissed. Amendment is futile as to\n\nthese counts.\nD. Claims under Delaware Law\n1. Legal Malpractice\n\nCount VI alleges that attorney James P. Hall committed legal malpractice\nwhen he concealed National General Insurance Company\u2019s settlement offer to\nPlaintiff. Plaintiff relies upon Exhibits 1 and 5 to support his claim.\n\nTo state a claim for legal malpractice under Delaware Law, Plaintiff must\nallege \u201c(a) the employment of the lawyer, (b) the lawyer\u2019s neglect of a professional\nobligation, and (c) resulting loss.\u201d Tarrant v. Ramunno, 2017 WL 3725068, at *1\n171 A.3d 138 (Del. Aug. 29, 2017) (unpublished). To show a resulting loss,\nPlaintiff must show the underlying suit would have been successful but for the\nnegligence of the lawyer. Id.\n\nHere, Plaintiff alleges he retained Hall as counsel and that Hall did not relay\na settlement offer to Plaintiff. A reading of the Complaint does not suggest\nresulting loss. As pled, Count VI fails to state a claim upon which can be granted.\nCount VI will be dismissed. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend Count VI.\n\n2. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n\nCount VII raises an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against\nDefendants Hall and Copart, Incorporated. Count VII alleges that Hall ignored\nPlaintiff's \u201cmultiple urgent pleas of submitted and providing [Plaintiff] with\n\nevidence that he made an offer of settlement to Zurich American Insurance\n7\nCompany\u201d and Hall lied about not receiving a settlement offer all of which placed\nPlaintiff under extreme distress. The Complaint relies upon Count IV (that will be\ndismissed) to support an intentional infliction of emotional distress clam against\nCopart.\n\nDelaware applies Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 in defining the\nelements of intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Cummings v. Pinder,\n574 A.2d 843, 845 (Del. 1990) (per curiam). That section imposes liability, in\nrelevant part, on \u201cOne who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or\nrecklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such\nemotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily\nharm.\u201d Outrageous conduct is \u201cconduct that exceeds the bounds of decency and is\nregarded as intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d Goode v. Bayhealth Med. Ctr.,\nInc., 2007 WL 2050761, at *2 (Del. July 18, 2007).\n\nCount VII fails to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress. As pled, it cannot be said that Defendants are liable for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress. As to Hall, the alleged behavior may be negligent\nbut it does not amount to conduct that \u201cexceeds the bounds of decency.\u201d As to\nCopart, the claims against it raised in Count IV (upon which Plaintiff relies) will be\ndismissed. Count VII fails to state claims upon which relief can be granted, and it\n\nwill be dismissed. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend Count VII as to Hall.\n8\n3. Vicarious Liability\n\nCount VIII alleges that Phillips, McLaughlin & Hall, National General\nInsurance Company, Zurich American Insurance Company, Copart, Incorporated,\nAmazon.com, Incorporated, and Sedgwick Claims Management Services,\nIncorporated, all are vicariously liable for the acts of their employees. All counts\nof the Complaint will be dismissed. Thus, the vicarious liability claims are not\ncognizable. See Verrastro v. Bayhospitalists, LLC, 208 A.3d 720, 724 (Del. 2019).\nAccordingly, Count VIII will be dismissed for failure to state claims upon which\nrelief can be granted. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend Count VIII.\nIV. ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATION\n\nPlaintiff seeks electronic notification. (D.I. 6) The motion will be denied\nwithout prejudice. It is not clear if Plaintiff moves to file electronically or only\nreceive electronic notification. Regardless, a PACER account is necessary to\nreceive electronic notification. The Court requires that Plaintiff indicate he has\nindependently reviewed all of the materials and related topics on the Court\u2019s web\nsite related to electronic filing and he must have a PACER account. His motion\ndoes not meet these requirements.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny without prejudice to renew\n\nPlaintiffs request for electronic notification (D.I. 5); (2) dismiss the Complaint\n9\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii); and (3) give Plaintiff leave to\namend Counts I, II, VI, VII, and VIII.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n10\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nDAVID Q.
