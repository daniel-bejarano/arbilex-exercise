Andrews", "date": "01-31-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSPRINT COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY \nL.P., \nPlaintiff; \nV. \nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS , INC., \nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS \nHOLDINGS , LLC, SPECTRUM \nMANAGEMENT HOLDING COMPANY , \nLLC, CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS \nOPERATING, LLC, TIME WARNER CABLE, \nLLC, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 18-2033-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nBefore me are Charter's objections (D.I. 216) to the Magistrate Judge's Report and \nRecommendation. (D.I. 215). I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 216,222). For the \nfollowing reasons, Charter's objections (D.1. 216) are sustained. Charter's motion for summary \njudgment of non-infringement (D.1. 188) is granted. \nI. BACKGROUND \nSprint sued Charter for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,754,907 (\"the '4,907 patent\"), \n6,757,907 (\"the '7,907 patent\"), and 7,559,077. (D.I. 1). The third patent, the 7,559,077 patent, \nwas later dismissed with prejudice. (D.I. 99). Sprint accuses Charter's \"Send-to-TV\" feature of \ninfringing the '4,907 and '7,907 patents (collectively \"the '907 patents\"). (D.I. 189-1, Ex. 2 at \n2). The Send-to-TV feature allows Charter customers to use an app on a device such a phone to \nplay video-on-demand content on their television. (D.I. 190 at 7). Two sets of customers are \n1 included in Sprint's allegations-those using the Spectrum Guide program in legacy Charter \nmarkets and those using the Spectrum Guide program in legacy Time Warner Cable (\"TWC\") \nand Bright House Networks (\"BHN\") markets. (D.I. 190 at 8; D.I. 189-2, Ex. 3 at 3). \nCharter moves for summary judgment of non-infringement of all asserted claims of the \n'907 patents. (D.I. 190 at 1). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nThe standard ofreview of a Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation on a motion \nfor summary judgment is de nova. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3). \nSummary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute \nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56( a). When determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences \nin that party's favor. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). A dispute is \"genuine\" only \"if \nthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242,248 (1986). \nSummary judgment of noninfringement \"is appropriate when it is apparent that only one \nconclusion as to infringement could be reached by a reasonable jury.\" TechSearch , L.L. C. v. \nIntel Corp., 286 F.3d 1360, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nI construed several claim terms to exclude the \"use\" or \"involvement\" of a \"set-top box \nfor remote control.\" (D.I. 168 at 2-3). For example, the term \"operating a video-on-demand \nsystem\" means \"operating a video-on-demand system without the use of a set-top box for remote \ncontrol.\" (Id. at 2). All asserted claims in the '907 patents contain such a term. \n2 Charter described how the accused systems work in response to an interrogatory. In that \nresponse, there is evidence that the accused systems use a set-top box for remote control. The \ninterrogatory response includes flow diagrams and descriptions of how the accused systems \noperate. (D.I. 189-2, Ex. 3 at 28-32, 35-39). The interrogatory itself is uncontested. (D.I. 215 at \n5). \nThe parties devote many pages to arguments about the minutiae of the flow diagrams. I \ndo not think a deep dive is necessary to capture the set-top box's involvement in the \"Send-to-\nTV\" process. To summarize , when a user selects an \"asset\" (or content) to play, a message gets \nsent to the set-top box. (D.I. 189-2, Ex. 3 at 30 ,r,r 1-2). The set-top box then \"direct(s]\" another \ncomponent to \"launch an active video session.\" (Id. ,r 3). Components other than the set-top box \nthen identify and retrieve information about the content the user requested and display \ninformation about that content on the user's television . (Id. ,r,r 3-4). The user can then press \n\"Watch\" with his or her remote control to confirm playback. When the user selects \"Watch,\" \n\"the remote control device sends a corresponding signal to the [set-top box], which then sends a \nsignal confirming the remote control command to the SGUI module of the Spectrum Guide \nplatform to initiate retrieval\" of the requested program. (Id. at 30-31 ,r,r 5-6). Several other steps \noccur until the set-top box tunes to the right channel and downloads the program for playback to \nthe user. (Id. at 31 ,r 9). 1 \nSprint raises various arguments for how the set-top box is not involved in remote control. \nSprint's theory appears to be that another component in the Send-to-TV feature, the \"SGUI,\" \n1 I have cited to the flow diagram and description describing the legacy Charter customers, but \nthe flow diagram and description for the TWC/BHN customers are substantially the same. (D.I. \n189-2, Ex. 3 at 36-39). Sprint's answering brief (D.I. 197) reads as though there is only one \naccused service. \n3 remotely controls operation of the video-on-demand system. (See D.I. 222). According to \nSprint, \"there is no evidence that Charter's [set-top box] ever is informed what video was \nselected by the user, and Charter's [set-top box] does not send any messages to the [video-on\u00ad\ndemand] server prior to video playback. \" (Id. at 6). The claim construction, however, requires \nthat the set-top box cannot be \"use[ d]\" for or \"involve[ ed]\" in remote control. That other \ncomponents are also involved , or even more prominently involved, in remote control is of no \nimport. The process outlined in Charter's interrogatory , which is undisputed, uses and involves a \nset-top box for remote control. In fact, when a user selects \"Watch\" on the remote control, it is \nthe set-top box that receives the message and kicks off retrieval of the program. (D.I. 189-2, Ex. \n3 at 30-31 ,r,r 5-6). \nThe Magistrate Judge found that Charter's briefing contained statements of fact that were \ninconsistent with the interrogatory response. (D.I. 215 at 13). Ultimately, I agree with Charter \nthat these details are not material. (D.I. 216 at 7-10). Even if there are inconsistencies, they \nrelate to what information is communicated to and from the set-top box during the \"Send-to-TV\" \nprocess. (See D.I. 215 at 15-22). I do not think the precise information relayed to and from the \nset-top box matters. The interrogatory makes clear that the set-top box receives signals from a \nuser's remote control, and in response sets off a chain of events that ends in the video-on\u00ad\ndemand content being played on the user's television. Thus, the set-top box is clearly \"use[d]\" \nand \"involve[ d]\" in the remote control of the video-on-demand system. \nDefendants ' objections (D.I. 216) to the Report and Recommendation (D.I. 215) are \nsustained . Defendants ' motion for summary judgment of non-infringement on all asserted \n4 claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,754,907 and 6,757,907 (D.I. 188) is granted. \nA separate order will issue. \n5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSPRINT COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY \nL.P., \nPlaintiff; \nV. \nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS , INC., \nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS \nHOLDINGS, LLC, SPECTRUM \nMANAGEMENT HOLDING COMPANY , \nLLC, CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS \nOPERATING , LLC, TIME WARNER CABLE, \nLLC, \nDefendants. \nORDER Civil Action No. 18-2033-RGA \nDefendants ' objections (D.I. 216) to the Report and Recommendation (D.I. 215) are \nSUSTAINED.
