{"case_name": "Smith v. Rogers", "case_number": "21-1674", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "04-14-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nFREDERICK W. SMITH, JR.,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 21-1674-RGA\nKRISTY L. ROGERS, :\nDefendant.\n\nFrederick W. Smith, Sussex Correctional Institution, Georgetown, Delaware. Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nApril 14, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nANDRE AG. istrict Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Frederick W. Smith, R., an inmate at Sussex Correctional Institution in\nGeorgetown, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 2). Plaintiff\nappears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.1. 10). He\nhas filed a motion to amend. (D.I. 12). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(a).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff alleges that on October 7, 2021, Defendant Kent\nCounty Probation Officer Kristy L. Rogers, perjured herself, lied in an administrative\nwarrant, and stated that Plaintiff had violated his curfew. (D.I. 2 at 5). He alleges that\nas a homeless man he does not have a curfew, and Defendant caused him to be\nillegally detained. (/d.). Plaintiff alleges that SCI documents state that Plaintiffs end of\nincarceration was to be from October 7, 2021 through November 3, 2021, and that as of\nthe date of the Complaint (/.e., November 9, 2021) he remained incarcerated. (/d. at 6).\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory damages. (/d. at 8).\n\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Baill v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n\n1\n\n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\n\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of\n\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Weizel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d /d.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\n\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n\n2\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\nasserted. See id. at 11.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiffs motion for leave to amend the complaint will be granted. Plaintiff\nattempts to raise two claims: (1) Defendant lied on her affidavit of probable cause\nwhich led to the issuance of an administrative warrant and Plaintiffs detention; and (2)\nPlaintiff was held after his release date.\n\nThe Complaint does not indicate if a violation of probation hearing was held and,\nif so, what the outcome was. See, e.g., Shelley v. Wilson, 339 F. App\u2019x 136, 139 (3d\nCir. 2009) (\u201cjury's finding that Shelley committed each element of these offenses\n\n3\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt defeats his assertion that there was no probable cause to\narrest him.\u201d). Without the necessary facts, the Complaint fails to state a claim against\nDefendant.\n\nPlaintiffs second claim is also deficient. An inmate held after his release date\nmay state a cause of action. See Montanez v. Thompson, 603 F.3d 243 (3d Cir. 2010)\n(inmate must demonstrate three elements to establish \u00a7 1983 liability against a prison\nofficial: (1) a prison official had knowledge of the prisoner\u2019s problem and thus of the risk\nthat unwarranted punishment was being, or would be, inflicted; (2) the official either\nfailed to act or took only ineffectual action under the circumstances, indicating that his\nresponse to the problem was a product of deliberate indifference to the prisoner's plight;\nand (3) a causal connection between the official's response to the problem and the\nunjustified detention.). Defendant, as a probation officer, is not a prison official as is\nrequired to state a claim that Plaintiff was held after his release date.\n\nAccordingly, the Complaint will be dismissed and Plaintiff will be given leave to\namend.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Plaintiff's motion for leave to\namend; and (2) dismiss the Complaint for failure to state claim upon which relief can be\ngranted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nFREDERICK W. SMITH, JR.,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 21-1674-RGA\nKRISTY L. ROGERS, ;\n\nDefendant.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 14\" day of April, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the\nmemorandum opinion issued this date;\n\nIT IS ORDERED that:\n\n1. Plaintiffs motion for leave to amend (D.1. 12) is GRANTED.\n\n2. The Complaint is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)\nand \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\n\n3. Plaintiff is given leave to file an amended complaint on or before May 9,\n2022. The Clerk of Court will be directed to close the case should Plaintiff failure to\n\ntimely file an amended complaint.\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n"}
