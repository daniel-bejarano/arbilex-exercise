Veale. Ms. Veale \nguaranteed the debt. Her business later declared bankruptcy, reorganized, and ultimately failed \nagain. Before the Court is Strategic's appeal (D.I. 1) from the Bankruptcy Court's Opinion, In re \nVeale, 2021 WL 5614923 (Bankr. D. Del. Nov. 30, 2021), and accompanying Order (Adv. D.I. \n18) (A226)1 (\"Dismissal Order\"), which dismissed with prejudice Strategic's Complaint asserting \nthat Ms. Veal's personal guarantee of the business debt is nondischargeable under various \nprovisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523. The merits of the appeal are fully briefed. (D.I. 13, 15, 16).2 For \nthe reasons set forth below, the Dismissal Order is affirmed. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. The Complaint \nThe. Complaint (A006-A100) (\"Compl.\") alleges the following facts: \n1. On or about April 11, 2017, Ms. Veale (the \"Debtor\") executed a loan agreement \nwith Strategic in her capacity as owner of Retro Home Health Care Services, as Borrower, and in \nher individual capacity, as Guarantor. (See Compl. ,r 12 (A008) & Ex. A (A031-A049) (the \"Loan \nAgreement\")). \n2. The Loan Agreement provided that Strategic would provide Retro with a loan in \nthe principal amount of $230,000.00, and Retro promised to pay Strategic the \"Repayment \n1 The docket of the adversary proceeding, captioned Strategic Funding Source, Inc. v. Michelle A. \nVeale, Adv. No. 21-50486-BLS (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"Adv. D.I. _.\" The appendix \n(D.I. 14) filed in support of Strategic's opening brief (D.I. 13) is cited herein as \"A_.\" \n2 I did not hear oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in \nthe briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral \nargument. \n2 Amount\" of $319,700.00 (consisting of principal in the amount of $230,000.00 and interest in the \namount of $89,700.00) in 52 weekly payments of $6,152.80 each, reflecting an effective interest \nrate of approximately 39 percent. (Compl. ,r 14). \n3. The Debtor personally guaranteed Retro's payment and performance under the \nLoan Agreement. (Compl. ,r 13). \n4. Prior to finalizing the Loan Agreement and advancing the funds, Strategic recorded \na telephone call with the Debtor in which Strategic asked the following questions: \nQ: Have you been planning to file or do you know of any reason to believe that your \nbusiness will need to file for bankruptcy protection in the foreseeable future? \nA: No, no I don't. \nQ: Do you currently have a balance with any other merchant cash advance provider? \nA: No. \n5. On or about April 13, 2017, Strategic advanced the loan amount, less fees (the \n\"Funds\"). (Compl. ,r 15). \n6. Pursuant to instructions by Retro and the Debtor, Strategic paid $101,327.81 of the \nFunds directly to creditor Provider Web Capital to satisfy a balance owed by Retro and the Debtor. \n(Compl. ,r 16). \n7. From April 17, 2017 through May 15, 2017, Strategic received five payments from \nRetro's bank account totaling $30,764.00. (Compl. ,r 17). \n8. On or about May 22, 2017 and May 30, 2017, Strategic attempted to draft the next \ntwo payments from Retro's bank account, but both payments were rejected and failed to clear. \n9. From May 25, 2017 through July 14, 2017, Strategic made numerous attempts to \ncontact Retro and the Debtor to address the \"stop payment\" on the account and the outstanding -\nbalance under the Loan Agreement, but neither Retro nor the Debtor returned Strategic's calls. \n3 (Compl. ~ 20). \n10. On July 17, 2017, Retro filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy case (the \"Retro \nBankruptcy\") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana (the \n\"Indiana Bankruptcy Court\"). (Compl. ~ 21). \n11. Retro paid Strategic nine monthly adequate protection payments of $1,000.00 each \npursuant to the Final Order Authorizing Use of Cash Collateral entered by the Indiana Bankruptcy \nCourt. (Compl. ~ 22). \n12. On August 2, 2018, Retro's chapter 11 plan was confirmed, and on November 8, \n2018, Strategic received payment of $5,099.41. (Compl. ~ 23). \n13. The Loan Agreement required the entire balance owed to Strategic to be paid by \nApril 2018. (Compl. ~ 25). When the Debtor failed to make any payments under the personal \nguarantee, on May 18, 2018, Strategic filed a complaint against the Debtor in the Circuit Court of \nthe County of Hanover, Virginia (the \"Virginia State Court\") alleging claims of breach of contract \nand fraud. (Compl. ~ 26 & Ex. B (A050-A097)). \n14. The Debtor failed to appear in the Virginia State Court, and Strategic obtained a \ndefault judgment against the Debtor on July 17, 2018 for more than $300,000.00, including \nprincipal of $230,000.00, a default fee of $2,500.00, unpaid interest of $51,486.00, attorney's fees \nof $16,500.00, plus interest at the judgment rate of 6% per annum and any and all court costs. \n(Compl. ~~ 27-28 & Ex. C (A098-A100)). \n15. On February 18, 2021, the Debtor filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case before the \nBankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. \nThe Complaint contains four counts, each seeking a declaration that the Debtor's guarantee \nis nondischargeable pursuant to various subsections of Bankruptcy Code\u00a7 523. Generally, \nStrategic alleges that the Debtor made the following misrepresentations at the time the loan was \n4 made (the \"Alleged Misrepresentations\"): \n(1) Retro and the Debtor were not insolvent; \n(2) Retro and the Debtor's financial conditions were such that Retro would not need to \nfile bankruptcy in the \"foreseeable future\"; \n(3) the assets subject to the security agreement were free from any liens, security \ninterests or other encumbrances that would be superior or adverse to Strategic; \n(4) Retro and the Debtor would fulfill the obligations under the Loan Agreement by \nallowing Strategic to draft the agreed payments from one designated bank account and provide \nStrategic with, irrevocable access to the account for repayment; \n(5) Retro and Debtor would deposit all receivables into the bank account; \n( 6) Retro's financial information was accurately reflected in documents and \ninformation produced to Strategic; \n(7) Retro intended to use the funding for business purposes rather than personal, \nfamily, or household purposes; \n(8) the Debtor intended to guarantee full and prompt performance of all obligations; \n(9) neither Retro nor the Debtor were in arrears with any of their creditors; \n(10) Retro was in good standing under all applicable laws under which Retro operates; \nand \n(11) neither Retro nor the Debtor had or would have an outstanding balance with any \nother merchant cash advance provider. \nB. The Motion to Dismiss \nThe Debtor filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(6), \u00b7 \nmade applicable to adversary proceedings in bankruptcy under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy \nProcedure 7012(b), on the basis that the facts alleged in the Complaint did not support claims for \n5 fraud or other grounds that would prevent the discharge of her guarantee obligations. The Debtor \nasserted that the facts establish only that the small business she owned was struggling and took on \na high interest loan from Strategic, which she guaranteed. Retro made payments on the loan, but \nthen defaulted and filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy case. The Debtor contended that the facts of this \ncase are no different from any other business lending transaction in which a borrower cannot pay \nand seeks protection under the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor sought dismissal of the Complaint \nwith prejudice. (See Al27, A130, A165). Strategic's response to the motion to dismiss (Al36-\n152) argued that the Complaint sufficiently pied facts in support of the asserted claims, and the \nrecord reflects that Strategic did not seek leave to amend the Complaint either in its response or \nduring oral argument (Al 69-203). \nC. The Opinion and Order \nFollowing briefing and oral argument, the Bankruptcy Court issued the Opinion and Order \ndismissing Strategic' s Complaint on the basis that \"the Complaint fails to allege facts that support \nplausible claims for nondischargeability under\u00a7 523(a)(2), (4) or (6)\"3 and further holding that \ndismissal without leave to amend was appropriate because the \"factual allegations evince a \nbusiness loan that went sour, nothing more.\" In re Veale, 2021 WL 5614923, at *1, *10 n.70. On \nDecember 14, 2021, Strategic filed a timely notice of appeal. (D.I. 1 ). \nII. JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE STANDARDS \nThe Court has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a final judgment of the Bankruptcy Court \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(l). In reviewing the bankruptcy court's determinations, this Court \n\"review[s] the bankruptcy court's legal determinations de nova, its factual findings for clear error \nand its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof.\" See In re Trans World Airlines, Inc., 145 F.3d \n3 Dismissal of Strategic's claim for a nondischargeability determination under\u00a7 523(a)(4) is not at \nissue in this appeal. (See D.I. 13 at 38-39 n. 11). \n6 124, 130 (3d Cir. 1998). \nThis Court reviews the dismissal de novo and the decision to do so with prejudice for \nabuse of discretion. See Langford v. City of Atlantic City, 235 F.3d 845, 847 (3d Cir. 2000); \nLorenz v. CSX Corp., l F.3d 1406, 1414 (3d Cir. 1993). \nThe Bankruptcy Code is designed to give \"a fresh start [to] the honest but unfortunate \ndebtor,\" and exceptions to discharge are narrowly construed. Marrama v. Citizens Bank, 549 \nU.S. 365,367 (2007). A complaint seeking an exception to discharge is assessed in three steps: \nFirst, the Court must \"tak[ e] note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim.\" Burtch v. -\nMi/berg Factors, Inc., 662 F.3d 212, 221 (3d Cir. 2011). It identifies allegations that, \"because \nthey are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.\" Id. Finally, \n\"where there are well-pleaded factual allegations,\" the Court \"assume[s] their veracity and then \ndetermine[s] whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief.\" Id. Because Strategic's \nclaims (with the exception of those arising under\u00a7 523(a)(6)) all allege fraudulent conduct, its \nclaims must be plead with particularity. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9 (made applicable to this adversary \nproceeding pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7009(b)). \nIII. ANALYSIS \n\"Dischargeability exceptions are narrowly construed.\" Balascio v. Leitzke (In re Leitzke), \n2014 WL 3583706, *3 (Bankr. D. Del. July 18, 2014). Courts have recognized that \"the reasons \nfor denying a discharge must be real and substantial, not merely technical and conjectural.\" \nKapitus Serv., Inc. v. Polk (In re Polk), 2020 WL 762215, *2 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. Feb. 14, 2020) \n(cleaned up). \"A narrow construction is warranted given that one of the fundamental policies \nunderlying the Bankruptcy Code is to permit honest debtors to reorder their financial affairs and \nobtain a 'fresh start,' unburdened by the weight of preexisting debt.\" Leitzke, 2014 WL 3583706, \nat *3. A creditor objecting to the discharge of debts bears the burden of proof. Id. \n7 A. COUNT 1-Nondischargeability of Debt Pursuant to\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) \nThe Bankruptcy Court concluded that Count I of Strategic' s Complaint does not meet the \nplausibility standard for claims under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Section 523(a)(2)(A) provides that an \nindividual's debt will not be discharged to the extent that the debt was obtained by \"false \npretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor's or \nan insider's fmancial condition.\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).4 To prevail on a claim of \nnondischargeability under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), a creditor must generally prove that: \n(1) the debtor obtained money, property or services through a material \nmisrepresentation; (2) the debtor, at the time, knew the representation was false or \nmade with gross recklessness as to its truth; (3) the debtor intended to deceive the \ncreditor; (4) the creditor reasonably relied on the debtor's false representations; and \n( 5) the creditor sustained a loss and damages as a proximate result of the debtor's \nmaterially false representations. \nIn re Bocchino, 794 F.3d 376, 380-81 (3d Cir. 2015) (citation and emphasis omitted). \nWhen pleading fraud, the Complaint must allege the particularity of the circumstances \nconstituting the fraud-\"the who, what, when, where, and how of the events at issue.\" Charles \nKapish v. April Cruz-Brewer (In re Cruz-Brewer), 609 B.R. 1, 10 (Bankr. M. D. Pa. 2019) (citing \nIn re Rockefeller Ctr. Prop., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198,217 (3d Cir. 2002)); Fed. R. Civ. P. \n9(b) (applicable pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7009). \nThe Bankruptcy Court correctly noted that only four of the Alleged Misrepresentations \nrelate to the Debtor's guarantee debt: (1) the Debtor was not insolvent; (8) the Debtor intended to \nguarantee full and prompt performance of all obligations; (9) the Debtor was not in arrears with \nany of her creditors; and (11) the Debtor did not have an outstanding balance with any other \n4 \"Although the terms 'false pretenses,' 'false representation,' and 'actual fraud' refer to different \nconcepts, they are closely related and each requires a plaintiff to demonstrate 'proof of false or \ndeceptive conduct, fraudulent intent, and justifiable reliance.\"' In re Altieri, 2012 WL 3595298, \n*2 (Bankr. D. N.J. Aug. 20, 2012) (citing In re Neale, 440 B.R. 510, 521 (W.D. Wis. 2010)). \n8 merchant cash advance provider. The remaining Alleged Misrepresentations are specific to Retro. \nAs \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) does not apply to statements about a debtor's financial condition (which are \ncovered by \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B)), the Bankruptcy Court concluded that its inquiry was limited to \nAlleged Misrepresentation (8)-that is, whether the facts alleged in the Complaint support a \nplausible claim that the Debtor falsely represented her intent to guarantee Retro's obligations. The \nBankruptcy Court noted that, in a similar case, the Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of \nGeorgia explained: \nThe test may be stated as follows. If, at the time he made his promise, the debtor \ndid not intend to perform, then he made a false representation (false as to his intent) \nand the debt that arose as a result thereof is not dischargeable (if the other elements \nof\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) are met). Ifhe did so intend at the time he made his promise, but \nsubsequently decided that he could not or would not perform, then his initial \nrepresentation was not false when made. \nIn re Polk, 2020 WL 762215, *7 (citations and emphasis omitted). \nThe Bankruptcy Court correctly identified the two particularized_allegations that could \nsupport Strategic' s claim that the Debtor falsely represented her intent to guarantee Retro's \nobligations: (i) the Debtor made no payments after Retro's bankruptcy, and (ii) the Debtor did not \nappear in Virginia (a state she has never lived in) to contest Strategic's lawsuit to recover its debt. \n(Compl. at~~ 24-28). The question is whether those two allegations merit an inference that the \nDebtor never intended to honor her guarantee. To make such an inference, the Court must \nconclude that since fact one happened, fact two also likely happened. A \"fact [must] make a \nsecond fact more probable than not.\" Brick v. Conti, 572 B.R. 73, 78 (Banlcr. W.D.N.Y. 2017). In \nthe context of fraud, this means that a court \"simply cannot infer fraudulent intent from conduct \nthat is equally susceptible to a more innocent interpretation.\" In re Contella, 166 B.R. 26, 31 \n(Banlcr. W.D.N.Y. 1994). \n9 Allegations of nonpayment, without more, cannot support a claim that the Debtor \nknowingly made a false representation at the time she guaranteed the loan. In re Giarratano, 299 \nB.R. 328,336 (Bankr. D. Del. 2003). \"A debtor's statement of future intention is not necessarily \na misrepresentation if intervening events cause the debtor's future actions to deviate from \npreviously expressed intentions.\" In re Polk, 2020 WL 762215, at *7 (quoting 4 Collier on \nBankruptcy ,r 523.08[1][d] (16th ed. 2021)). Thus, allegations that the Debtor did not write any \npersonal checks to satisfy Strategic and did not appear in Virginia to contest Strategic' s claim are \ninsufficient to support an inference that the Debtor falsely represented her intent to guarantee the \nloan from Strategic at the time the debt was incurred. \nOn appeal, Strategic argues that the Third Circuit permits intent to perform to be \"inferred \nfrom the totality of the circumstances\" and may be satisfied by circumstantial evidence and the \nDebtor's \"reckless indifference or reckless disregard\" for the truth. See In re Bocchino, 794 F.3d \nat 3 81. According to Strategic, the Bankruptcy Court failed to consider allegations related to \nRetro in the totality of the circumstances regarding the Debtor's intent to perform at the time she \nentered into the Loan Agreement and Guaranty. But the Bankruptcy Court did consider the \nAlleged Misrepresentations made with respect to Retro and concluded that they did not support \nclaims under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) either: \nAlleged Misrepresentations ( 4) and ( 5) assert that the Business and the Debtor \nfalsely represented that SFS would have \"irrevocable access\" to a designated bank \naccount to collect repayments, and that the Business's receivables would be \ndeposited into that account. The Complaint alleges that SFS collected five \npayments from the Business's bank account, but thereafter was blocked from the \naccount. Without more, the allegations of nonpayment fail to plausibly support a \nclaim of misrepresentation when the loan was made. \nFurther, [there] are no factual allegations to plausibly support a claim that the \nDebtor (or Business) misrepresented the intent to use the Funds for anything other \nthan Business purposes [Alleged Misrepresentation (7)] or that the Business was \nnot in good standing [Alleged Misrepresentation (8)]. In re Veale, 2021 WL 5614923, at *5. I agree that the allegations regarding nonpayment and the \nbare allegation concerning Retro's misrepresented good standing ( a written statement, which is \ndiscussed further below), considered in the totality of the circumstances, are insufficient to support \nan inference that the Debtor never intended to honor her guarantee at the time the debt was \nincurred. The alleged conduct is equally susceptible to a more innocent interpretation-that the \nDebtor intended to honor her obligations and repay Strategic but her business failed. \nB. COUNT II -Nondischargeability of Debt Pursuant to\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) \nThe Complaint alleges in Count II that the Debtor's guarantee is nondischargeable under \nBankruptcy Code\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B). Elements ofnondischargeability under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) are: \n(B) use of a statement in writing-\n(i) that is materially5 false; \n(ii) respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition; \n(iii) on which the creditor to whom the debtor is liable for such money, property, \nservices, or credit reasonably relied; and \n(iv) that the debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceive. \n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B). \"The text of\u00a7 523(a)(2) plainly heightens the bar to discharge when the \nfraud at issue was effectuated via a 'statement respecting the debtor's financial condition.\"' In re \nVeale, 2021 WL 5614923 at *6. \"The heightened requirements, moreover, are not a shield for \ndishonest debtors,\" the Bankruptcy Court observed. Id. \"Rather, they reflect Congress' effort to \nbalance the potential misuse of such statements by both debtors and creditors.\" Id. As the \nSupreme Court has explained: \nThe House Report on the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 suggests that Congress \nwanted to moderate the burden on individuals who submitted false financial \nstatements, not because lies about financial condition are less blameworthy than \n5 \"Materiality is ordinarily an issue left to the factfinder and is therefore not typically a matter for \nRule 12(b)(6) dismissal.\" In re Adams Golf, Inc. Sec. Litig., 381 F.3d 267,274 (3d Cir. 2004). \n11 others, but because the relative equities might be affected by practices of consumer \nfinance companies, which sometimes have encouraged such falsity by their \nborrowers for the very purpose of insulating their own claims from discharge. \nLamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 138 S. Ct. 1752, 1763 (2018) (cleaned up). As with\u00a7 \n523(a)(2)(A), intent to deceive under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) \"can be inferred from the totality of the \ncircumstances, including the debtor's reckless disregard for the truth.\" In re Cohn, 54 F.3d 1108, \n1118-19 (3d Cir. 1995). \nThe Bankruptcy Court found that the Complaint failed to plead any facts to support an \ninference that the Debtor made written misrepresentations about her individual financial condition \nor intended to deceive Strategic in connection with the guarantee. In re Veale, 2021 WL 5614923 \nat *6-7. Strategic argues on appeal that a claim under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) includes false statements \nabout the financial condition of an \"insider\" of the debtor as well. The Bankruptcy Code defines \n\"insider\" with respect to an individual debtor to include a \"corporation of which the debtor is a \ndirector, officer, or person in control.\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(3 l)(A)(iv). It is undisputed that the \nDebtor was, at all relevant times, a person in control of Retro. \nStrategic cites the In re Rodi case from the Northern District of Illinois, which, like this \ncase, considered application of\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) to statements made about the financial condition of \nan insider in connection with a loan and personal guaranty. 163 B.R. 1017, 1023 (N.D. Ill. 1994). \nThere, a chapter 7 debtor was the director and president of a boat dealership. Id. at 1018. The \ndealership sought financing from a lender, but the lender refused to provide financing unless the \ndebtor executed a personal guaranty. Id. at 1019. The dealership's financing application \ncontained a representation that there were no pending lawsuits against the dealership that could \nadversely affect the dealership's financial condition. Id. However, the debtor knew, and failed to \ninform the lender, that the dealership's mortgage holder had commenced foreclosure proceedings \nagainst the dealership. Id.; see also id. at 1022. The lender in that case asserted that the debtor's \n12 debt under the financing agreement and personal guaranty was nondischargeable under \nBankruptcy Code\u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (B). Id. at 1020. The district court rejected the debtor's \nargument that the statement was not false under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) because it was made about the \ndealership's financial condition, not the individual debtor's financial condition. See id at 1022-\n23. The court found that the debtor's argument \"ignores the plain language of\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B)\" and \nheld that\"[ s ]ince [debtor] is the director and president of [the dealership], this statement \nrespecting [the dealership's] condition is actionable under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B).\" Id. at 1023; see also 4 \nCollier on Bankruptcy ,r 523.08[2][c][i] (16th ed. 2021) (\"The definition of 'insider' becomes of \ncritical importance because, if the debtor makes a false statement ... respecting the financial \ncondition of a corporation of which the debtor is a director, officer or person in control, the \nexception of section 523(a)(2)(B) is operative. Nor does it matter whether the money, property, \nservices or credit was obtained for the debtor or for another; what is important is that the statement \nbe false respecting the debtor's financial condition or respecting the financial condition of an \n'insider.'\"). \nStrategic argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred in disregarding the Debtor's alleged \nmisrepresentations regarding Retro's financial condition in its analysis of claims under \u00a7 \n5'23(a)(2)(B). But the Opinion reflects that the Bankruptcy Court considered all of the Alleged \nMisrepresentations, including those concerning Retro's financial condition. In re Veale, 2021 WL \n5614923, at *6-7. While the Opinion highlights that none of the alleged written \nmisrepresentations concerned the Debtor's individual financial condition, and thus did not support \na plausible claim for nondischargeability of the guarantee debt under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B), the \nBankruptcy Court also found that the specific Alleged Misrepresentations concerning Retro \ncontained in \"the pre-printed loan agreement\" appeared to be\" 'technical and conjectural' rather \nthan substantial reasons for asserting nondischargeability because the Complaint lacks factual \n13 allegations showing that any of the statements were made with an 'intent to deceive.\"' Id at *6 \n(quoting In re Polk, 2020 WL 762215, at *2). \nAs alleged in the Complaint, the Debtor made the following written misrepresentations \ncontained in the pre-printed Loan Agreement: (i) that neither the Debtor nor Retro is insolvent or \nanticipates that a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy petition will be filed (Compl. ,r 39; Loan \nAgreement \u00a7 2. 7); (ii) that Retro \"has good and marketable title to all assets, free and clear of any \nand all liabilities, liens, ... security interests, ... and encumbrances of any kind or nature \nwhatsoever ... that may be inconsistent with the transactions contemplated with, or adverse to the \ninterests of [Strategic]\" (Compl. ,r 39; Loan Agreement \u00a7 2.9); (iii) that the financial statements \nprovided to Strategic \"fairly represent the financial condition of [Retro] and [Debtor] at such \ndates\" (Compl. ,r 39; Loan Agreement\u00a7 2.1); and (iv) that \"[a]ll information provided by [Retro] \nand [Debtor] to [Strategic] in this [Loan] Agreement ... , is true, accurate and complete in all \nrespects\" (Compl. ,r 39; Loan Agreement\u00a7 2.14). Strategic argues that these misrepresentations, \ntaken as a whole or individually, constitute a basis to find that the Debtor has made written \nstatements that are materially false respecting her financial condition or the financial condition of \nan insider, with the intent to deceive Strategic. \nAlleged Misrepresentations (1) and (2), based on Section 2. 7 of the Loan Agreement, \nassert that the Debtor falsely represented that Retro and the Debtor were not insolvent and that \nneither anticipated filing for bankruptcy. 6 Strategic asserts that the timing of Retro's default ( one \nmonth after receiving the loan), and Retro's bankruptcy filing (three months after receiving the \nloan), create an inference that the Debtor's statements in Section 2. 7 were false. However, the \n6 I do not consider the Alleged Misrepresentations made during a telephone phone call between \nthe Debtor and Strategic for several reasons, including that any such statements do not fall under \u00a7 \n523(a)(2)(B) which pertains only to the \"use of a statement in writing.\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B). \n14 timing alone, without more, is insufficient raise a plausible inference of an intent to deceive \nStrategic. Where a complaint pleads facts that are \"merely consistent with\" a defendant's liability, \nit \"stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 544 (internal punctuation omitted). There are no particularized pleadings suggesting \u00b7 \nthat the Debtor or Retro was considering a bankruptcy, and the record suggests the contrary. The \nDebtor didn't file for bankruptcy until years after. Retro didn't hire its bankruptcy counsel or file \nfor bankruptcy until months after the Loan Agreement, and, in the meantime, it continued making \npayments. There are no allegations that Retro wasn't paying its employees or vendors in the \nordinary course of business. The Alleged Misrepresentations are insufficient to support a \nplausible claim that the Debtor intended to deceive Strategic as to an anticipated bankruptcy. \nAlleged Misrepresentation (3) is the Debtor's representation in Section 2.9 of the Loan \nAgreement that the assets subject to the security agreement were free from any liens, security \ninterests or other encumbrances, despite there being liens on some of Retro's assets. As the \nDebtor correctly points out, the Loan Agreement states only that: \"Borrower has good and \nmarketable title to all assets, free and clear of any and all liabilities, liens, claims [ and] \nencumbrances of any kind or any other rights or interests that may be inconsistent with the \ntransactions contemplated with, or adverse to the interests of, [Strategic].\" (A039). The facts \nalleged in the Complaint show that Strategic received a lien, which entitled Strategic to adequate \nprotection payments in Retro's Chapter 11 case. There is no hint that any underlying liens are \ninconsistent with Strategic' s interests, and Strategic conceded as much in the Bankruptcy Court: \n\"Plaintiff acknowledges that the language of the Security Agreement does not expressly state that \n\u2022 \nPlaintiff have a superior position over Defendant's assets.\" (A146). At bottom, nothing in the \nComplaint supports a plausible claim that the Debtor intended to deceive Strategic with respect to \n\"liens inconsistent with Strategic' s interests\" at the time she signed the Loan Agreement. \n15 Accordingly, Alleged Misrepresentation (3) is insufficient to state a plausible claim under\u00a7 \n523( a)(2)(B). \nAlleged Misrepresentations (6) and (10) assert that the Debtor falsely represented that all \ninformation provided by the Debtor and Retro in the Loan Agreement and Guaranty \"is true, \naccurate and complete in all respects\" and that Retro was in good standing \"under the laws of the \njurisdictions in which it is organized and/or operates.\" According to Strategic, Retro was not in \ngood standing under applicable law based on a \"large repayment it owed to Medicaid, and a large \nassessment from the Department of Labor (\"DOL\") for unpaid overtime\" as supported by Retro's \nbankruptcy schedules, which were attached to the Complaint. Because these debts were \nforeseeable to Retro and the Debtor, Strategic argues, they support a claim for fraud based on a \nmaterial nondisclosure. But whether or not the Debtor was \"aware that the Medicaid repayment .. \n. and the [DOL] assessment ... were due or would likely be coming due soon,\" as Strategic \nalleges, the Loan Agreement did not call for this specific information to be disclosed. Accepting \nas true that Retro owed payments, or would likely owe payments in the future, does not alone \nequate to lack of \"good standing\" under state law. The allegations fall short of supporting a \nplausible claim that the Debtor made a false statement. \nAlleged Misrepresentations (9) and (11) assert that the Debtor falsely represented that \nneither Retro nor the Debtor were in arrears with any creditor and that neither would have an \noutstanding balance with any other merchant cash advance provider. Section 2.8 of the Loan \nAgreement simply provides that the Borrower (Retro) would not enter into any financing \nagreement without the written permission of Strategic. The language does not address the \nDebtor's individual financial condition or the guarantee. In the relevant financial statement \nattached as Exhibit B to the Complaint, the Debtor lists a current debt obligation of $100,000 as a \nliability and states that Retro's purpose for the loan was \"consolidation.\" (See Al 11; Al 78). \n16 Strategic honored Retro's request to pay almost 50% of the loan principal directly to Retro's \ncreditors. The bare allegation that Strategic was deceived by the Debtor, based on the preprinted \nlanguage of the Loan Agreement, is not sufficient to support a plausible claim of fraud. \nIn sum, I agree with the Bankruptcy Court that the facts alleged in the Complaint do not \nsupport any plausible claims under\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) based on the Alleged Misrepresentations \nconcerning either the Debtor's individual financial condition or that of Retro. \nC. COUNT 3-Nondischargeability of Debt Pursuant to\u00a7 523(a)(6) \nSection 523(a)(6) provides that an individual debtor will not receive a discharge from any \n', \ndebt \"for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another \nentity.\" 11 u'.s.c. \u00a7 523(a)(6). \"The word 'willful' in (a)(6) modifies the word 'injury,' \nindicating that nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury, not merely a deliberate \nor intentional act that leads to injury.\" Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U.S. 57, 61 (1998) (emphasis \nomitted).. A knowing breach of contract will not ordinarily rise to the level of \"willful and \nmalicious.\" Norm Gershman 's Things to Wear, Inc. v. Peterson (In re Peterson), 332 B.R. 678, \n682 (Bankr. D. Del 2005); see also GMAC Inc. v. Coley (In re Coley), 433 B.R. 476,499 (Bankr. \nE. D. Pa. 2010) (\"An intentional breach of contract is excepted from discharge under\u00a7 523(a)(6) \nonly when it is accompanied by malicious and willful tortious conduct.\" (quoting Mitsubishi \nMotor Sales of Caribbean, Inc. v. Ortiz, 418 B.R. 11, 25 (D. P.R. 2009)). \"A breach of contract is \nnot 'willful and malicious conduct' under\u00a7 523(a)(6) unless accompanied by conduct that would \ngive rise to a tort action under state law.\" Lockerby v. Sierra, 535 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir. 2008) \n( deciding that an attorney's intentional breach of a settlement agreement of the former client's \nmalpractice claims involved \"ordinary debt\" and was not tortious under Arizona state law and, \ntherefore, was not \"willful and malicious\" under\u00a7 523(a)(6)). The Bankruptcy Court determined \nthat the allegations contained in the Complaint asserted nothing more than an intentional breach of \n17 contract, and as such, the allegations did not support a plausible claim for nondischargeability \nunder\u00a7 523(a)(6). In re Veale, 2021 WL 5614923, at *8. \nStrategic puts forth no discernible error on appeal. Strategic repeats its allegations that the \nDebtor and Retro misrepresented their anticipation of bankruptcy and their promise to deposit \nsufficient funds to make the agreed payments. \"Notwithstanding those representations, the Debtor \nblocked Strategic from accessing the account and cut Strategic off from collecting payments due \nunder the Loan Agreement.\" (D.I. 13 at 38). According to Strategic, \"The Debtor's actions were \nintentional, without just cause or excuse, and [were] substantially certain to produce harm to \nStrategic,\" and, therefore the Complaint pleads \"a plausible claim for nondischargeability under \nSection 523(a)(6) for willful and malicious injury.\" Id. The allegations contained in the \nComplaint assert nothing more than an intentional breach of contract, and I see no basis to disturb \nthe Bankruptcy Court's determination. \nD. Dismissal With Prejudice \nThe record reflects that Strategic did not seek leave to amend the Complaint to cure \ninfirmities either in its response or during oral argument, and instead chose to rely upon the \nsufficiency of the allegations raised in the Complaint. (See Al36-152; A169-203). Strategic \nessentially contends that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in not granting sua sponte \nrelief that Strategic failed to even seek. This is not the law. As the Third Circuit has clarified, \nthere is no requirement, outside of civil rights cases, that district courts must sua sponte grant \nleave to amend before dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim. See Fletcher-Harlee \nCorp. v. Pote Concrete Contractors, 482 F.3d 247,252 (3d Cir. 2007). \nLeave to amend should be \"freely given\" in the absence of \"undue delay, bad faith or \ndilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments \npreviously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \n18 amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\" Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). In \ndismissing the Complaint with prejudice, the Bankruptcy Court cited its prior discussion of the \n\"high bar for asserting plausible nondischarageability claims,\" and concluded that \"dismissal \nwithout leave to amend was warranted here\" as the \"factual allegations evince a business loan that \nwent sour, nothing more.\" In re Veale, 2021 WL 5614923 at *1. Strategic argues that the \nBankruptcy Court erred by holding that any amendment of the complaint would be futile as a \nmatter oflaw. (D.I. 13 at 17). Conversely, the Debtor argues that the Bankruptcy Court properly \ndismissed the Complaint with prejudice based on the incongruence between the particularized \nfacts and the conclusions drawn from them. \"It's not that the pleadings were imprecise, it's that \nwhat the Appellant says happened doesn't support its claims. In other words, where the money \ncame from, why it was supplied, where the money went after the company received it, and what \nthe creditor received in exchange for it have all been pied and it is not enough.\" (D.I. 15 at 29). \n\"A claim is not futile merely because it will be difficult to prove. In other words, the claim \nmust be futile as a matter of law rather than merely unlikely as a matter of fact. The issue \ninvolved in a motion to dismiss is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether he \nis entitled to present evidence in support of his claims.\" In re PMTS Liquidating Corp., 490 B.R. \n174, 184 (D. Del. 2013) ( citations and internal quotation marks omitted). I agree, however, that \neven assuming Strategic had properly requested leave to amend, and presented the Bankruptcy \nCourt with the additional allegations presented in its appellate briefs, amendment here would be \nfutile. The appeal asserts no new allegations that would merit rethinking the Bankruptcy Court's \nconclusion. Strategic proposes amendments based on information contained in Retro's chapter 11 \nPlan (\"Retro Plan\"), a proof of claim filed by the DOL (\"DOL POC\"), and Retro's July 2017 \nmonthly operating report (\"MOR\"). These documents were not addressed in the Complaint, but \naccording to Strategic, the DOL POC and Retro Plan provide support for Strategic's allegation \n19 that the Debtor knew that Retro was liable for the DOL assessment a month prior to entering into \nthe Loan Agreement. (See A313-24 (DOL POC); A347 (Retro Plan)). According to Strategic, the \nDebtor's statement in the Retro Plan that she took out a loan \"in hopes of keeping the company \nfrom dissolving\" further supports that Retro was contemplating bankruptcy at the time it entered \ninto the Loan Agreement. (A347). Strategic asserts that it would add allegations related to those \ndocuments if permitted to amend the Complaint, and that those allegations may be sufficient to \nstate a claim for nondischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). \nStrategic' s allegation that the Debtor was aware of the DOL assessment at the time of the \nloan has already been asserted. \"Defendant took out the Loan with Plaintiff fully aware that it \nwould be hit with DOL assessments that it would not be able to pay.\" (A146). That the loan \nproceeds were used for personal expenses like fast food has already been pled as well. And if re\u00ad\npled, neither would make a difference in supporting a plausible claim that the Debtor had no ' \nintention of fulfilling the guaranty at the time of the loan or intended to deceive Strategy. That is \nthe definition of futile. In Sherwin Pipeline, Inc. v. Sherwin Alumina Co., the Fifth Circuit \naffirmed a dismissal with prejudice where \"[i]t would be futile to allow an amendment to the \nComplaint because there are no facts that could be plead[ed] to support' the claim.\" 952 F.3d 229, \n236 (5th Cir. 2020). The Court explained, \"This determination was no abuse of discretion. The \nPort's fraud claim is premised on an alleged misrepresentation made by Sherwin's counsel \nregarding modifications. The bankruptcy court determined the Port could plead no additional fact \nto salvage this claim.\" Id. \nHere, as in Sherwin Pipeline, repleading would not alter the outcome because the \ntransaction is wholly understood, meaning that repleading would simply rehash the same facts to \ninvite the same outcome-the hallmark of futility. Accordingly, I find no abuse of discretion in \nthe Bankruptcy Court's dismissal with prejudice. \n20 IV. CONCLUSION \nI will affirm the Dismissal Order for the reasons set forth herein.
