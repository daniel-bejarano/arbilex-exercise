{"case_name": "Sapp et al v. Industrial Action Services, LLC et al", "case_number": "19-912", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "05-26-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nKEVIN B. SAPP and JAIME HOPPER, \nPlaintiffs; \nV. \nINDUSTRIAL ACTION SERVICES, LLC and \nRELADYNE , LLC, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 19-912-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file under seal for the purpose of giving Defendants \nan opportunity to demonstrate whether any portions of the materials would work a clearly \ndefined and serious injury to Defendants. (D.I. 78). See In re Avandia Marketing, Sales \nPractices and Products Liability Litigation, 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019). Defendants \nresponded by asking for sealing of portions of Exhibits C (a power point presentation) and E (the \nWichmann Affidavit and exhibits) to the Hopper Declaration (D.I. 84), and Plaintiffs replied, \nopposing some of the requests (D.I. 87). I have reviewed Defendants' requests. The documents \nDefendants want to redact address a variety of subjects, but there are none that self-evidently \nwould work a clearly defined and serious injury if disclosed. Generalized attorney argument is \nlikewise insufficient. There is no declaration from anyone showing how the disclosure of \ninformation, most of which is between four and eight years old, would work any \"clearly defined \nand serious injury\" to Defendants or to anyone else. Since I am not going to strike the Hopper \nDeclaration, and since Defendants have not shown that portions of Exhibit C and E should be \nPage I of 1 A, \nredacted at all, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED this u, day of May 2022 that the Hopper \nDeclaration and its exhibits (D.I. 81) are UNSEALED. \nUnited States \nPage 2 of 2 "}
