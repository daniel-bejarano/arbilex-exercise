Andrews  \nANDREWS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore me is Defendants East Ocean Agriculture Corp. (\u201cEast Ocean\u201d)  and Xiandong Shi\u2019s \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and under Rule \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (D.I. 10). The motion has been fully briefed and I have \nconsidered the parties\u2019 briefing.  (D.I. 11, 14, 20) . \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs, eight individuals who were previously employed by East Ocean and Shi  (D.I. 1 \n\u00b6 6), bring this action against Defendants under the Fai r Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) and \nanalogous Delaware state laws. They allege failure to pay overtime wages, failure to pay minimum wages, unpaid wages, and retaliation under the FLSA . (D.I. 1 \u00b6 \u00b6 52-57, 58-60, 64-67, 72-76). They \nalso allege failure to pay minimum wages under the Delaware Minimum Wage Act  (MWA) and \nunpaid wages under the Delaware Wage Payment and Collection Act (WPCA). (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  61-63, \n68-71). \nDefendant East Ocean operates a \u201cfarm  business\u201d  (\u201cthe farm\u201d) in Bridgeville, Delaware. \n(Id. \u00b6 7).  Defendant Shi has been the \u201c sole owner and president \u201d of the farm since December 2018. \n(Id. \u00b6 10).  Throughout Plaintiffs\u2019 employment at the farm, Shi supervised the Plaintiffs and other \nfarm workers and was responsible for their work schedules and compensation. ( Id. \u00b6 11).  \nPlaintiffs Ji Guo Wu, Zhen Lei, and Xinbin Tian (\u201cXinbin\u201d) were employed by Defendants  \nas drivers . (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15, 24, 29). They were  responsible for delivering vegetables from the farm \nto New York  to be sold there . (Id.).  \n\uf0a7 Wu was employed by Defendants from September 27, 2017, to July 20, 2020. ( Id. \n\u00b6 14). Wu \u201cgenerally worked for more than 12 hours per day, seven (7) days a week\u201d  for a salary of $5,000 per month. ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18). On September 1, 2019, 3 \n approximately 24 months into Wu\u2019s employment, Shi paid Wu\u2019s salary from April \n15, 2019, to August 30, 2019 (4.5 months)  and acknowledged he owed Wu wages \nfor 19.5 additional months. ( Id. \u00b6 19). At that time, Shi increased Wu\u2019s salary to \n$8,000 per month, but from then until the end of Wu\u2019s employment on July 20, 2020, he only paid Wu for the period from September 2019 to November 2019. \n(Id.). On July 20, 2020, Shi fired Wu \u201cafter he compl ained about not receiving \npayment of his wages.\u201d ( Id. \u00b6 22).  \n\uf0a7 Lei was employed by Defendants from July 14, 2020, to around September 20, 2020. ( Id. \u00b6 23). Lei \u201cgenerally worked for more than 12 hours per day, seven (7) \ndays a week.\u201d ( Id. \u00b6 25). Lei\u2019s wages were $200 per round trip between the farm \nand New York, but he \u201cdid not receive full payment of his wages from Defendants.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 26).  \n\uf0a7 Xinbin was employed by Defendants from November 1, 2019, to June 16, 2020. \n(Id. \u00b6 28). Xinbin \u201cgenerally worked f or more than 12 hours per day\u201d and in one \nmonth, April 2020, Xinbin worked more than 14 hours per day. ( Id. \u00b6 30). Xinbin\u2019s \nwages were $150 per day, but he received only $240 total wages from Defendants. \nPlaintiffs Shouhuai Yang, Xiuju Deng, Cuimin Tian, S uhong Yang (\u201cSuhong\u201d), and \nChunyang Cai were employed by Defendants as farm workers. ( Id. \u00b6 33).  \n\uf0a7 Shouhuai Yang was employed by Defendants from August 2017 to December \n2019. ( Id. \u00b6 35). Yang \u201cgenerally worked for more than 11 hours per day and 77 \nhours per week\u201d  and worked 13 hours per day from December 2018 to February \n2019. (Id. \u00b6 36 , 37). Yang\u2019s salary was $3,000 per month. ( Id. \u00b6 34). From 4 \n November 2019 to December 2019, Yang did not rece ive any wages from \nDefendants. ( Id. \u00b6 38).  \n\uf0a7 Deng was employed by Defendants from August 2017 to December 2019. ( Id. \u00b6 \n35). Deng \u201cgenerally worked for more than 11 hours per day and 77 hours per \nweek\u201d and worked 13 hours per day from December 2018 to Februar y 2019. ( Id. \u00b6 \n36, 37). Deng\u2019s salary was $2,700 per month. ( Id. \u00b6 34).  From November 2019 to \nDecember 2019, Deng did not receive any wages from Defendants. ( Id. \u00b6 38).  \n\uf0a7 Cuimin Tian was employed by Defendants from July 2018 to June 2019. ( Id. \u00b6 39). \nTian worked \u201cat least 11 hours per day and 77 hours per week.\u201d ( Id. \u00b6 42). Tian\u2019s \nsalary was $3,000 per month. ( Id. \u00b6 34). Tian did not receive any wages from \nDefendants from May 2019 to June 2019. ( Id. \u00b6 43 ). \n\uf0a7 Suhong was employed by Defendants from  July 2018 to June 2019. ( Id. \u00b6 39). \nSuhong worked \u201cat least 11 hours per day and 77 hours per week.\u201d ( Id. \u00b6 42). \nSuhong\u2019s salary was $2,700 per month. ( Id. \u00b6 34).  Suhong did not receive any \nwages from Defendants from May 2019 to June 2019. ( Id. \u00b6 34).  \n\uf0a7 Cai was employed by Defendants from April 20, 2019, to December 18, 2019. ( Id. \n\u00b6 44). Cai \u201cgenerally worked for more than 11 hours per day and 77 hours per \nweek.\u201d ( Id. \u00b6 47). Cai did not receive any wages from Defendants from November \n2019 to the end of hi s employment. ( Id. \u00b6 48).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nthe Court must accept the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true.  See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 555\u201356 (2007).  Rule 8(a) requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing 5 \n that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  Id.  at 555.  The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, \nbut they must provide more than labels, conclusions, or a \u201cformulaic recitat ion\u201d of the claim \nelements.  Id. (\u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in \nfact).\u201d).  Moreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The facial plausibility standard is satisfied \nwhen the complaint\u2019s factual content \u201callows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Id. (\u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d (cl eaned up )). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. FLSA Claims  \nTo state a claim under the FLSA  minimum wage /unpaid wages  provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n206(a) , or the overtime wage s provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1) , a plaintiff must allege : \n1) an employer/employee relationship between plaintiff and defendant, within the \nmeaning of the FLSA. Tony & Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec\u2019y of Labor , 471 U.S. 290, \n295 (1985); Cherichetti v. PJ Endicott Co., 906 F. Supp. 2d 312, 316 (D. Del. 2012) ; \n2) either\n1  \na) that the employee was \u201cengaged in [interstate] commerce or in the production \nof goods for [interstate] commerce,\u201d or  \n \n1  Alamo Found., 472 U.S. at 295 n.8 (\u201cEmployment may be covered under the [FLSA]  \npursuant to either \u2018 individual \u2019 or \u2019enterprise \u2019 coverage. Prior to the  introduction of enterprise \ncoverage in 1961, the only individuals covered under the Act were those engaged directly in \ninterstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce.\u201d).  6 \n b) that the employee was \u201cemployed in an enterprise engaged in [interstate] \ncommerce\u201d where the gross volume of sales made or business done by tha t \nenterprise is not less than $500,000 per \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A); and  \n3) depending on the type of claim : \na) the approximate number of hours  during which the plaintiff was paid an hourly \nwage less than the minimum hourly wage required by \u00a7 206(a)(1) , for minimum \nwage claims . Cherichetti , 906 F. Supp. 2d at 316;  \nb) the approximate number of hours  during which the plaintiff was not paid any \nwages , for unpaid wages claims . Id.; or  \nc) at least \u201ca single workweek in which [the plaintiff] worked at least forty hours \nand also worked uncompensated time in excess of forty hours, \u201d for overtime \nwage claims . Davis v. Abington Memorial Hosp. , 765 F.3d 236, 243 (3d Cir. \n2014) . \n Defendants primarily argue2 that the first and second requirements for stating a FLSA \nclaim (employer/employee relationship and individual/ enterprise coverage) are jurisdictional \nrequirements , and a failure to plead them requires dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). ( D.I. 11 at  4-5, \n7-10). Defendants do not cite any binding Third Circuit authority in support of their contention \nthat these requirements are jurisdictional. Plaintiffs argue these requirements are elements of a FLSA claim, not jurisdictional prerequisites. (D.I. 14 at 3- 4).  \nI agree with Plaintiffs . The Supreme Court has given clear guidance , \u201cwhen Congress does \nnot rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as \n \n2  Defendants also argue, in the alternative, that these requirements are elements of a FLSA \nclaim  and failure to plead them requires dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  7 \n nonjurisdictional in character .\u201d Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 515- 16 (2006). B ecause the \nFLSA does not \u201cclearly state[] \u201d that the limitations on coverage  should \u201ccount as jurisdictional,\u201d \nI find they should be considered elements of a FLSA claim. Id.; see also Biziko v. Van Horne , 981 \nF.3d 418, 420 (5th Cir. 2020)  (holding enterprise requirement is nonjurisdictional as it contains no \njurisdictional language and is found in the FLSA\u2019s definition section) ; Martinez v. Petrenko , 792 \nF.3d 173, 175 (1st Cir. 2015) ( holding that individual or enterprise nexus to commerce requirement \nis \u201can essential element\u201d of a FLSA claim ). \n For these reasons, I find that subject matter jurisdiction is proper  in this case  and turn now \nto Defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6)  arguments  regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead each of the three \nelements of a FLSA claim .  \n1. Employer/Employee  Relationship   \nThe FLSA defines an employee as \u201cany individual employed by an employer.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 203(e)(1). \u201cThere is no single test to determine whether a person is an employee or an \nindependent contractor for purposes of the FLSA. The statutory definitions regarding employment status are necessarily broad to effectuate the remedial purposes of the Act.\u201d Martin v. Selker Bros., Inc., 949 F.2d 1286, 1293 (3d Cir. 1991). The Third Circuit uses a six- factor test that examines the \n\u201ccircumstances of the whole activity\u201d to  determine whether an employment relationship exists \nunder the FLSA. Id.  The factors include:  \n1) the degree of the alleged employer\u2019s right to control the manner in which the \nwork is to be performed; 2) the alleged employee\u2019s opportunity for profit or los s \ndepending upon his managerial skill; 3) the alleged employee\u2019s investment in \nequipment or materials required for his task, or his employment of helpers; 4) whether the service rendered requires a special skill; 5) the degree of permanence of the working relationship; 6) whether the service rendered is an integral part of the alleged employer\u2019s business.  \nId. (quoting Donovan v. DialAmerica Marketing, Inc., 757 F.2d 1376, 1382 (3d Cir. 1985)).  8 \n Defendants  appear to argue that Plaintiffs have failed to alleg e that  they are employees \nwithin the meaning of the FLSA. (D.I. 20 at 2 (\u201cTo state a claim under the FLSA, a plaintiff must \nallege: (1) he is an employee of the defendant \u2026 Plaintiffs fail to allege the first of these \u201d)). They \ndo not, however, offer any su bstantive  arguments in support of this conclusory statement . Instead, \nthey seem  to argue that the first required element, an employer/employee relationship, is lacking \nbecause of a failure to meet the second element, individual or enterprise coverage,  and/or because \nof various FLSA exemptions . (D.I. 20 at 2; D.I. 11 at 16).  \nI find that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the employment relationship between Plaintiffs \nand Defendants are sufficient to plausibly state a claim that Plaintiffs were all \u201cemployees\u201d within \nthe meaning of \u00a7 203(e)(1) of the FLSA. The complaint \u2019s allegations relating to the nature of  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 work , their hours , and the power imbalance between Plaintiffs and Defendants  support \na finding that the Plaintiffs acted as employees and not as independent contractors. (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 13-\n51; see Donovan v. DialAmerica Marketing, Inc. , 757 F.2d 1376, 1382 (3d Cir. 1985) (holding \ncourts should \u201cconsider whether, as a matter of economic  reality, the individuals are dependent \nupon the business to which they render service\u201d) (cleaned up)) . \n2. Individual/Enterprise Coverage  \nDefendants  argue that Plaintiffs fail to \u201callege facts showing a nexus between plaintiffs and \ncommerce, as required for individual coverage under the FLSA.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 1). They also argue \nthat Plaintiffs fail to allege enterprise coverage because the complaint fails to allege that Defendants have \u201can annual gross volume of sales of not less than $500,000\u201d as required by \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A).  \nTo allege individual coverage, all that is required under  the FLSA is a showing that an \nemployee \u201cis engaged in [interstate] commerce or in the production of goods for [interstate] 9 \n commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). \u201cGoods\u201d are defined as \u201cgoods [], wares, products, \ncommodities, merchandise, or articles or subject of commerce of any character, or any part or \ningredient thereof\u2026\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(i). The crops  grown on Defendants\u2019 farm easily qualify as \n\u201cgoods .\u201d \nPlaintiffs allege that Wu  enga ged in \u201cselling vegetables  [from the farm] on the street, \u201d that \nLei \u201cworked as a driver to load and deliver vegetables from  the Farm to New York ,\u201d and that \nXinbin \u201cworked as a driver to load, deliver, and distribute vegetables from the Farm  [to be sold in \nNew York] .\u201d (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 24, 29).  There is hardly a more quintessential example of \u201cengaging in \ninterstate commerce\u201d than driving goods from one  state to be sold in another state. Defendants \u2019 \nargument that Plaintiffs have not pled a \u201cnexus between plaintiffs and commerce\u201d with respect to Wu, Lei, and Xinbin borders on frivolous.  \nPlaintiffs allege that Yang , Deng, Tian, Suhong, and Cai were all employed by Defendants \nas farm workers  in Delaware, where they helped grow and package vegetables to be sold in New \nYork . (Id. \u00b6 33). These activities clearly involve engaging \u201cin the production of goods for \n[interstate] commerce.\u201d  \nBecause I find that Plaintiffs have adequately pled individual coverage by alleging specific \nfacts showing each Plaintiff was either engaged in interstate commerce directly or engaged in the \nproduction of goods for interstate commerce, I need not consider whether Plaintiffs  have \nadequately alleged enterprise coverage.  \n3. Wage and Hours Allegations  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 minimum wage claims are insufficient with respect to all \nthe Plaintiffs. (D.I. 11 at 2). Specifically, they argue that the stated salaries of Wu, Yang, Tian, \nDeng, Suhong, and Cai exceed the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA. (D.I. 11 at 5 -6). 10 \n Whether Plaintiffs\u2019 typical salaries exceed the minimum wage requirements  is irrelevant  to the \nsufficiency of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, however, because Plaintiffs allege specific time periods  during \ntheir employment  in which Wu, Yang, Tian, Deng, Suhong, and Cai were not paid at all . (D.I. 1 \n\u00b6\u00b6 13 -51).  \nPlaintiffs allege Wu was not paid from December  2019 to July 20, 2020, despite being \nemployed by Defendants , and that throughout his  employment, he \u201cworked more than 84 hours \nper week .\u201d (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21, 22). Taken together, these allegations  allege approximately 2,562  \nhours of uncompensated labor  and 30.5 weeks during which Wu worked more than forty hours in \na single  week but  did not receive overtime compensation (or any compensation). Defendants \ncontend, \u201cAllegations that a plaintiff \u2018typically\u2019 or \u2018occasionally\u2019 worked more than a certain \nnumber of hours without specifying a given week are inadequate.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 7). I disagree.  In \nDavis , the Court clarified : \n[W]e do not hold that a plaintiff must identify the exact dates and times that she \nworked overtime. For instance, a plaintiff\u2019s claim that she \u201c typically \u201d worked forty \nhours per week, worked extra hours during such a forty- hour week, and was not \ncompensated for extra hours beyond forty hours he or she worked during one  or \nmore of those  forty -hour weeks, would suffice.  \n \nDavis v. Abington Memorial Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 243 (3d Cir. 2014).  Here, Wu has  alleged that in  a \u201ctypical\u201d week, he  worked more than forty hours  and has \nalleged specific weeks in which he  was not compensated for either his regular hours or his overtime \nhours . I find that these allegations , which allow  for a simple calculation of the approximate number \nof Wu\u2019s uncompens ated hours, plausibly state a claim of unpaid wages, failure to pay minimum \nwage, and failure to pay overtime wages . \nPlaintiffs allege Yang was not paid from November 2019 to December 2019, despite being \nemployed by Defendants and \u201cgenerally\u201d working \u201cmore than 11 hours per day and 77 hours per 11 \n week .\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 36, 38).  For the reasons stated above, t hese allegations plausibly state a claim \nof unpaid wages, failure to pay minimum wage and failure to pay overtime wages under the FLSA \nwith re spect to Yang . \nPlaintiffs allege Tian was not paid from May 2019 to June 2019, despite being employed \nby Defendants and working \u201cat least 11 hours per day and 77 hours per week.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42, 43). \nThese allegations plausibly state a claim of unpaid wage s, failure to pay minimum wage and failure \nto pay overtime wages under the FLSA with respect to Tian.  \nPlaintiffs allege Deng was not paid from November 2019 to December 2019, despite being \nemployed by Defendants and \u201cgenerally\u201d working \u201cmore than 11 hours per day and 77 hours per \nweek .\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 37, 38). These allegations plausibly state a claim  of unpaid wages, failure to pay \nminimum wage and failure to pay overtime wages under the FLSA with respect to Deng.  \nPlaintiffs allege Suhong was not paid f rom May 2019 to June 2019, despite being employed \nby Defendants and working \u201cat least 11 hours per day and 77 hours per week.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42, 43). \nThese allegations plausibly state a claim of unpaid wages, failure to pay minimum wage and failure \nto pay overtime wages under the FLSA with respect to Suhong. \nPlaintiffs allege Cai was not paid from November 2019 to December 18, 2019, despite \nbeing employed by Defendants and \u201cgenerally\u201d working \u201cmore than 11 hours per day and 77 hours per week .\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47, 48). These allegations plausibly state a claim  of unpaid wages, failure to \npay minimum wage and failure to pay overtime wages under the FLSA with respect to Cai . \nFor the other two Plaintiffs, Defendants argue that the c omplaint is not sufficien tly specific  \nabout what the minimum and overtime wage claims are.  (D.I. 11 at 6).  I disagree  as to Xinbin, \nbut not as to Lei. 12 \n Plaintiffs allege Xinbin received payment of $240 in total as his wages from Defendants, \ndespite working \u201cfor more than 12 hours  per day\u201d from November 1, 2019, to June 16, 2020. ( Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 28, 30, 32). These allegation s plausibly state a claim of unpaid wages, failure to pay minimum \nwage and failure to pay overtime wages under the FLSA with respect to Xinbin. \nPlaintiffs allege Lei \u201cdid not receive full payment of his wages from Defendants.\u201d ( Id. \u00b6 \n27). The complaint, how ever, does not allege how much in total Lei was owed , nor does it allege \nby how much Lei was underpaid. The complaint alleges Lei \u201cgenerally worked for more than 12 \nhours per day, seven (7) days a week,\u201d and states , \u201cLei\u2019s wages were $200 .00 per round trip \nbetween the Farm and New York ,\u201d but does not say how many trips Lei took during his \nemployment, how long each trip took, or how much Lei was ultimately paid. ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23 -27). \nBecause the complaint does not specifically allege any time period  during which Lei was paid less \nthan minimum wage, had overtime wages withheld from him, or did not receive wages at all, the complaint fails to plausibly state a claim under the FLSA with respect to Lei. I will therefore  \nGRANT  Defendants\u2019 motion to dismis s Count s I (Overtime Wages Under the FLSA), II \n(Minimum Wage Under the FLSA), and IV (Unpaid Wages Under the FLSA) with respect to Lei.  \n4. FLSA Exemptions  \nAffirmative defenses that are obvious on the face of the complaint and would \u201c present [] an \ninsuperable barrier to recovery by the plaintiff\u201d may be considered on a motion to dismiss. Flight Sys., Inc. v. Electronic Data Sys . Corp., 112 F.3d 124, 127 (3d Ci r. 1997). Plaintiffs, however, are \nnot required to plead the absence of affirmative defenses. The absence of an applicable exemption is not a required element of a FLSA claim.  Whether certain FLSA exemptions apply often presents \na mixed question of law and fact. Hein v. PNC Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc., 511 F.Supp.2d 563, 570 \n(E.D. Pa. 2007).  13 \n Here, Defendants argue that plaintiff Wu is exempt from the FLSA wage and hours \nprovisions under the FLSA Exemption for Executive, Managerial, or Professional Workers, 29 \nU.S.C. 213 (a)(1). (D.I. 11 at 14; D.I. 20 at 9). Wu\u2019s stated salary in the complaint meets the salary \nrequirements of 29 CFR \u00a7 541.100(a)(1) for qualifying as an \u201cemployee employed in a bona fide executive capacity\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA. (D.I. 11 at 14). Whether he meets the additional requirements ( i.e., whether his \u201cprimary duty is management of the enterprise in which \nthe employee is employed,\u201d whether he \u201ccustomarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees,\u201d and whether he \u201chas the authority to hire or fire other employees ,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7 \n541.100(a)( 2)-(4)), however, is a contested factual question to which the answer is not apparent \non the face of the complaint. Therefore, the question of whether this exemption applie s is \ninappropriate for resolution at the motion to dismiss stage.  \nDefendants argue the FLSA\u2019s wage and hour requirements do not apply under the  \nAgricultural Exemption, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(6), which exempts employees employed in \nagriculture, \u201cif such employee is employed by an employer who did not, during any calendar \nquarter during the preceding calendar year, use more than five hundred man- days of agricultural \nlabor.\u201d  (D.I. 11 at 10- 13). It is not, however, obvious from the face of the complaint that this \nexemption applies. Plaintiffs make no allegations in their complaint regarding  how many total \nemployees Defendants had throughout the relevant time period and the Shi declaration (D.I. 11-1) \nDefendants point to is extrinsic (not to mention disputed) evidence that cannot properly be considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. (D.I. 11 at 11; D.I. 14 at 19- 20). Whether  the Agricultural \nExemption applies is a disputed factual question inappropriate for  resolution at the motion to \ndismiss stage.  14 \n Finally, Defendants argue that a second Agricultural Exemption, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(12) , \nwhich exempts \u201cany employee employed in agriculture \u2026\u201d from the FLSA section 207 maximum \nhours provisions  applies here. Plaintiffs argue that this exemption is qualified by the language that \nfollows \u201cemployed in agriculture,\u201d which describes employee s employed \u201cin connection with the \noperation or maintenance\u201d of various waterways. (D.I. 14 at 20). They do not , however, cite any \nsupport whatsoever for this argument.3 I find that Defendants are correct , and it is well established \nthat this exemption \u201c \u2018embrace [s] the whole field of agriculture.\u2019 \u201d Barks v. Silver Bait, LLC , 802 \nF.3d 856, 860 (6th Cir. 2015) ( quoting Maneja v. Waialua Agr. Co., 349 U.S. 254, 260 (1955)) ; \n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.401 (\u201cThe effect of [section 213(b)(12) ] is to provide a complete overtime \nexemption for any employee employed in \u2018agriculture\u2019 who does not qualify for exemption under \nsection 13(a)(6)(A).\u201d).  \n\u201cAgriculture\u201d is defined in section  213(b)(12) of the FLSA to include \u201cfarming in all its \nbranches \u2026 including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for \ntransportation to market.\u201d I find that it is clear f rom the face of the complaint that all Plaintiffs \nwere employed \u201cin agriculture\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA. Wu, Lei, and Xinbin were \nresponsible for  driving, loading, and deliver ing vegetables from the farm to New York, and Yang, \nDeng, Tian, Suhon, and Cai were \u201cemployed as farm workers.\u201d (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 24, 29, 33). For these \nreasons,  Count I, Overtime Wages Under the FLSA , is DISMISSED with respect to all Plaintiffs.  \n \n \n3  The relevant provision exempts \u201c any employee employed in agriculture or in connection \nwith the operation or maintenance of ditches, canals, reservoirs, or waterways, not owned or \noperated for profit, or operated on a sharecrop basis, and which are used exclusively for supply and storing of water, at least 90 percent of which was ultimately delivered for agricultural purposes during the preceding calendar year.\u201d  Pretty clearly, the exemption applies to two classes \u2013 the large class that is employed in agriculture and the limited class that is employed in connection with certain waterways that are related to agriculture.  15 \n 5. FLSA Statute o f Limitations  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 FLSA claims  accruing prior to May 7, 2018 \u201care time -\nbarred under the longest of the limitations periods of the FLSA, three years.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 16 (citing \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A)). Plaintiffs , however, have not asserted any claims that depend solely on \nevents  that occurred prior to May 7, 2018.4 (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 13 -51). Defendants\u2019 apparent suggestion that \nPlaintiffs must expressly \u201cconcede\u201d in their complaint that they \u201cdo not claim unpaid wages during times barred by the federal [] limitations period[]\u201d is  unsupported by any authority. (D.I.  20 at 9-\n10). Each Plaintiff has alleged at least one period of non- payment occurring entirely after May 7, \n2018. This satisfies the pleading standard.  \nB. MWA and WPCA Claims  \n1. MWA Agricultural Exemption  \nDefendants argue that P laintiffs are exempt from the minimum wage requirements of the \nDelaware Minimum Wage Act, 19 Del. C. \u00a7 901(3)(a) , which defines \u201cemployee\u201d as not including \n\u201c[a]ny individual employed in agri culture.\u201d  (D.I. 11 at 14- 15). Plaintiff s\u2019 only argument in \nresponse appears to be that , because \u201cthere is no case law interpreting the state exemption ,\u201d it does \nnot apply to them. (D.I. 14 at 26). Nevertheless, I find that it is clear from the face of the complaint \nand the plain meaning of the word \u201cagriculture\u201d that all eight  Plaintiffs are employed \u201cin \nagriculture.\u201d While the MWA does not define \u201cagriculture ,\u201d individuals  employed by a farm ing \nbusiness  to work on the farm  and transport  food grown on the  farm clearly qualify as individuals \n\u201cemployed in agriculture.\u201d  Plaintiffs cite no authority arguing otherwise. Therefore, I will GRANT  \n \n4  Wu alleges two  periods of non- payment. The first period begins on September 27, 2017 \nand ends on April 15, 2019. (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19). Wu also alleges non- payment from November \n2019 to  July 20, 2020. ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21). While Wu\u2019s recovery for the first period may be partial ly \nlimited by the statute of limitations, such limitations on recovery do not impact  the sufficiency of \nthe pleadings. 16 \n Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count III, failure to pay minimum wages, in violation of the \nDelaware Mi nimum Wage Act , with respect to all Plaintiffs . \n2. WPCA Statute of Limitations  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 remaining state law claim, unpaid wages under the Delaware Wage Payment \nand Collection Act, is governed by a one -year statute of limitations. 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8111. Therefore, \nclaims based  on activity occurring prior to May 7, 2020, are barred  as a matter of law . Plaintiffs \nYang, Deng, Tian, Suhong, and Cai all allege periods of non- payment that star ted and ended prior \nto May 7, 2020. (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 33 -51). Therefore, I will GRANT Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count \nV, unpaid wages under the WPCA, with respect to Yang, Deng, Tian, Suhong, and Cai. Because \nPlaintiffs allege periods of non- payment that extend beyond May 7, 2020 with respect  to the \nremaining Plaintiffs, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count V with respect to Wu, Lei,  and Xinbin \nis DENIED.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Defenda nts\u2019 motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART . Count I ( Overtime Wages Under the  FLSA ) is DISMISSED with respect to \nall Plaintiffs. Count III  (Minimum Wage Under  the MWA)  is DISMISSED with respect to all \nPlaintiffs. Counts II and IV (the remaining FLSA claims)  are DISMISSED with respect to Plaintiff \nZhen Lei. Count V  (Unpaid Wages Under  the WPCA ) is DISMISSED with respect to Plaintiffs \nShouhuai Yang, Xiuju Deng, Cuimin Tia n, Suhong Yang , and Chunyang Cai.   \nPlaintiffs have not asked for leave to amend.  It is plausible that Plaintiff Zhen Lei could \namend the complaint to allege a minimum wage and/or an unpaid wage claim.  Thus, Plaintiff \nZhen Lei is granted leave to amend  those claims.  If there are any other claims that could  \n 17 \n successfully be amended, Plaintiffs have permission to file a motion seeking leave to do so.  \nAn appropriate order will issue .   "}
