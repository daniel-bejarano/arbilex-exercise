(D.I. 257) For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED-IN-PART.\nSpecifically, the motion to exclude is GRANTED with respect to portions of Dr. Lepore\u2019s\nobviousness opinion that rely on the inventors\u2019 internal documents and testimony. The motion is\nDENIED in all other respects.\n\nL BACKGROUND\n\nIn October 2019 and May 2020, Plaintiff brought these consolidated Hatch-Waxman suits\nagainst defendants MSN Laboratories Private Limited and MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together,\n\u201cDefendants\u201d) for alleged infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,579,473 (\u201cthe \u2019473 patent\u201d),\n8,497,284 (\u201cthe \u2019284 patent\u201d), and 8,877,776 (\u201cthe \u2019776 patent;\u201d collectively, the \u201cpatents-in-\n\n' A Daubert motion to exclude testimony presents a non-dispositive matter, and a magistrate\njudge\u2019s ruling on a non-dispositive motion is subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous and contrary to\nlaw\u201d standard of review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). See Masimo\nCorp. v. Philips Elec. N. Am. Corp., 62 F. Supp. 3d 368, 388 (D. Del. 2014).\n\n2 The briefing and filings related to Plaintiff's pending motion are found at D.I. 258, D.I. 259,\nDI. 263, and D.I. 265.\nsuit\u201d) based on Defendants\u2019 submission of Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201c\u201cANDA\u201d) No.\n213878 to the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) for approval to make and sell a generic\nversion of Cabometyx\u00ae. (D.I. 1; C.A. No. 20-633-RGA, D.I. 1) Cabometyx\u00ae is a tyrosine\nkinase inhibitor used to treat patients with kidney and liver cancer. (D.J. 1) The active chemical\ncompound in Cabometyx\u00ae is called cabozantinib, and the asserted claims of the \u2019776 patent\ncover a particular crystalline form of cabozantinib called the N-2 form. (/d. at \u00a718) The\nasserted claims of the \u2019473 patent cover compounds for modulating or inhibiting kinase activity,\nwith a particular focus on the modulation of c-Met tyrosine kinase, and the \u2019284 patent claims a\nmethod of treating cancers with a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds.? (C.A. No.\n20-633-RGA, D.I. 1, Exs. A-B)\n\nDr. Salvatore Lepore and Dr. Jonathan Steed issued their opening expert reports in\nOctober 2021, and they were deposed in March 2022 regarding their opinions on the invalidity of\nthe patents-in-suit. (D.I. 259, Exs. A, D, E, I) The opinions proffered by Drs. Lepore and Steed\nare the subject of Plaintiff's pending motion to exclude. (D.I. 257) Defendants have since\nagreed to withdraw their validity challenges to the \u2019284 and \u2019776 patents. (D.I. 270 at J 5)\nBecause Dr. Steed\u2019s obviousness opinion was limited to discussion of the \u2019776 patent, Plaintiff's\nchallenge to Dr. Steed\u2019s opinion is moot. (D.I. 269 at 4)\n\nIn his opening expert report, Dr. Lepore opined that the asserted claims of the \u2019473 patent\n\nare invalid as obvious in view of the prior art. (D.I. 259, Ex. A; D.I. 263, Ex. C) Specifically,\n\n3 The \u2019473 and \u2019284 patents define c-Met as a kinase that is \u201cthe prototypic member of a\nsubfamily of heterodimeric receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),\u201d which is expressed \u201cin a wide\nvariety of cell types including epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal cells where activation of\nthe receptor induces cell migration, invasion, proliferation and other biological activities\nassociated with \u2018invasive cell growth.\u2019 As such, signal transduction through c-Met receptor\nactivation is responsible for many of the characteristics of tumor cells.\u201d (\u2019284 patent, col. 2:53-\n62)\n\n2\nDr. Lepore opined that the prior art would have motivated a person of ordinary skill to select\nExample 5 from WO 03/000660 (the \u201cKirin Publication\u201d) as a lead compound and modify it to\nprepare cabozantinib, with a reasonable expectation of success in obtaining a c-Met tyrosine\nkinase inhibitor. (D.I. 259, Ex. A at 2)\n\nA bench trial is currently scheduled to begin on May 16, 2022. (D.I. 46 at 11) Fact\ndiscovery closed in September 2021 and expert discovery concluded in March 2022. (D.I. 46 at\n2; D.I. 234) The 30-month stay expires on November 5, 2022. (C.A. No. 20-633-RGA, D.I. 3)\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 sets out the requirements for expert witness testimony and\nstates:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training,\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert\u2019s\nscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to\nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based\non sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles\nand methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to\nthe facts of the case.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 702. The trial court has the \u201ctask of ensuring that an expert\u2019s testimony both rests\non a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\u201d Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms.\nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 594, 597 (1993).\n\nThe Third Circuit has explained:\n\nRule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony: qualification,\nreliability and fit. Qualification refers to the requirement that the witness\npossess specialized expertise. We have interpreted this requirement liberally,\nholding that \u201ca broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert.\u201d\nSecondly, the testimony must be reliable; it \u201cmust be based on the \u2018methods and\nprocedures of science\u2019 rather than on \u2018subjective belief or unsupported\nspeculation;\u2019 the expert must have \u2018good grounds\u2019 for his o[r] her belief. In\nsum, Daubert holds that an inquiry into the reliability of scientific evidence\nunder Rule 702 requires a determination as to its scientific validity.\u201d Finally,\nRule 702 requires that the expert testimony must fit the issues in the case. In\n\n3\nother words, the expert\u2019s testimony must be relevant for the purposes of the case\n\nand must assist the trier of fact. The Supreme Court explained in Daubert that\n\n\u201cRule 702\u2019s \u2018helpfulness\u2019 standard requires a valid scientific connection to the\n\npertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility.\u201d\n\nBy means of a so-called \u201cDaubert hearing,\u201d the district court acts as a\n\ngatekeeper, preventing opinion testimony that does not meet the requirements of\n\nqualification, reliability and fit from reaching the jury.\nSchneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried, 320 F.3d 396, 404-05 (3d Cir. 2003) (footnote and\ninternal citations omitted).* \u201cBut the question of whether the expert is credible or the opinion is\ncorrect is generally a question for the fact finder, not the court.\u201d Summit 6, LLC v. Samsung\nElecs. Co., Ltd., 802 F.3d 1283, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2015). \u201cVigorous cross-examination,\npresentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the\ntraditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u201d Daubert, 509\nU.S. at 596. Consistent with \u201ca strong preference for admitting any evidence that may assist the\ntrier of fact\u201d under the Federal Rules of Evidence, \u201cRule 702 . . . has a liberal policy of\nadmissibility.\u201d Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal citations\nand quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, the party offering expert testimony bears the burden\nof showing that it meets the standards for admissibility. Jd.\nI. ANALYSIS\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's motion to exclude the obviousness opinions of\nDr. Lepore is granted-in-part. Guiding the court\u2019s analysis is the overarching principle that \u201c[i]t\nis simply less critical to pre-screen expert testimony in the bench trial setting, since the court can\n\nsimply disregard expert evidence that it regards as unreliable, irrelevant, or unhelpful.\u201d APEX\n\n4 The Court of Appeals wrote under an earlier version of Rule 702, but the subsequent\namendments to it were not intended to make any substantive change.\n4\nFin. Options, LLC v. Gilbertson, C.A. No. 19-46-WCB-SRF, 2022 WL 613347, at *3 (D. Del.\nMar. 1, 2022).\n\nA. Identification of Specific Prior Art Combinations\n\nPlaintiff challenges the reliability of Dr. Lepore\u2019s expert opinions on obviousness,\narguing that he applied a flawed methodology due to his failure to identify specific prior art\ncombinations. (D.I. 258 at 1, 5-8) Asa result, Plaintiff contends that its rebuttal experts have\nbeen left to guess from among the millions of possible obviousness combinations in preparing\ntheir own opinions and testimony. (/d. at 10) To cure this prejudice, Plaintiff asks the court to\nexclude Dr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness opinion and preclude him from offering testimony at trial\nregarding specific prior art combinations that were not addressed in the expert report.* (Jd. at 10-\n11)\n\nDefendants respond that Dr. Lepore properly based his obviousness opinion on the\nrelated teachings of multiple specific prior art references, and a person of ordinary skill in the art\nwould be familiar with the relevant, publicly available prior art. (D.I. 263 at 7-12) Defendants\nsuggest that the level of detail in the rebuttal report of Plaintiff's expert is a testament to the fact\nthat Dr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness opinion was clearly disclosed and readily understood. (Jd. at 8-\n\n12)\n\n5 Defendants confirm that \u201cneither Dr. Lepore nor Dr. Steed will present at trial any opinions that\nwere not disclosed in their reports (thus mooting Exelixis\u2019 request to preclude them from\nproviding testimony \u2018not discussed in their expert reports.\u2019).\u201d (D.I. 263 at 7) Therefore, the\ncourt denies Plaintiffs motion to preclude Dr. Lepore from offering testimony at trial regarding\nspecific combinations not discussed in their reports as unduly speculative. Plaintiff also submits\nthat the obviousness opinions of Dr. Anthony Mega should be excluded, to the extent that those\nopinions are based on Dr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness analysis. (D.I. 258 at 7) Having determined\nthat Dr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness opinion should not be excluded for his alleged failure to identify\nspecific prior art combinations, the court concludes that no basis exists to exclude the portions of\nDr. Mega\u2019s obviousness opinion that rely on Dr. Lepore\u2019s opinion. (D.I. 259, Ex. B at {J 187-\n94)\n\n5\n\u201cThe reliability of an expert\u2019s conclusions and opinions hinges on the reliability of the\nexpert\u2019s methodology.\u201d Wood v. Showers, 822 F. App\u2019x 122, 124 (3d Cir. 2020). Here,\nDefendants have adequately established the reliability of Dr. Lepore\u2019s methodology. Although\nhis identification of prior art references opens the door to many possible permutations,\u00ae Plaintiff\nhas not shown that this methodology is unacceptable under Rule 702. Indeed, the Supreme\nCourt has \u201cset forth an expansive and flexible approach\u201d to the obviousness inquiry in\nrecognition of the fact that \u201cit will often be necessary to look to interrelated teachings of multiple\npatents; to the effects of demands known to the . . . community or present in the marketplace;\nand to the background knowledge possessed by a person having ordinary skill in the art.\u201d KSR\nInt\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 401, 415 (2007).\n\nIn his opening expert report, Dr. Lepore opined that the cabozantinib element of the \u00b0473\npatent would have been obvious in view of the Kirin Publication as the lead compound in\ncombination with one or more references from three categories of specific prior art references.\n(D.I. 263, Ex. C at \u00a5 204; see also D.I. 259, Ex. E at 11:18-13:2) The three categories of prior art\nreferences address: (1) c-Met\u2019s role in various cancers; (2) prior art related to selecting a lead\ncompound; and (3) prior art related to modifying the lead compound. (/d.) Dr. Lepore\u2019s\n\napproach is consistent with Federal Circuit authority stating that \u201ca prima facie case of\n\n6 Generally, parties address concerns about the number of asserted prior art references and\ncombinations through case narrowing proposals made earlier in the case. See, e.g., Masimo\nCorp. v. Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp., 918 F. Supp. 2d 277, 285-86 (D. Del. 2013) (citing cases).\nIn this case, Defendants served their initial invalidity contentions in the summer of 2020 and\nserved amended invalidity contentions in September 2021. (D.I. 37; D.I. 53, D.I. 196; D.I. 197)\nDefendants represent that the combinations disclosed in Dr. Lepore\u2019s expert report were\npreviously disclosed in their amended invalidity contentions, and Plaintiff does not refute\nDefendants\u2019 representation. (D.I. 263 at 5; D.I. 265) There is no indication on the present record\nthat Plaintiff sought to limit the number of asserted prior art references and/or combinations prior\nto filing the pending motion.\n\n6\nobviousness for a chemical compound . . . begins with the reasoned identification of a lead\ncompound\u201d in the prior art. Eisai Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy\u2019s Labs., Ltd., 533 F.3d 1353, 1359 (Fed.\nCir. 2008). After identifying the lead compound and the basis for its selection, Dr. Lepore\u2019s\nopening expert report addresses a category of prior art related to modifying the lead compound in\nkeeping with Federal Circuit precedent, which provides that \u201cthe requisite motivation [to\nmodify] can come from any number of sources.\u201d (D.I. 263, Ex. C at 204); Procter & Gamble\nCo. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 566 F.3d 989, 995 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Eisai, 533 F.3d at\n1357). To this end, the motivation to modify a lead compound can be derived from \u201cthe totality\nof the prior art\u201d and \u201cneed not necessarily be explicit in the art.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.\nTeva Pharms. USA, Inc., 752 F.3d 967, 973 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Dr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness opinion\nbased on the Kirin Publication and other prior art references divided into three categories is\nconsistent with these principles.\n\nPlaintiff argues that Dr. Lepore\u2019s failure to identify specific combinations of prior art\nreferences has prevented Plaintiff's expert from providing a meaningful response to Dr. Lepore\u2019s\nprior art arguments. (D.I. 258 at 10) But the rebuttal report of Dr. David MacMillan shows that\nhe discussed the prior art references with precision and was able to refute Dr. Lepore\u2019s\nobviousness opinions based on his understanding of Dr. Lepore\u2019s positions. (D.I. 263, Ex. E at\n{] 373-80) In keeping with Dr. Lepore\u2019s analysis, Dr. MacMillan discussed the prior art\nreferences collectively in his rebuttal. (See, e.g., D.I. 263, Ex. E at \u00a7 380) (\u201cNone of the\ncyclopropyl-containing compounds Dr. Lepore presents is even remotely structurally similar to\nthe compounds in Kirin[.]\u201d). Because Dr. MacMillan was able to \u201crespond in proportion to Dr.\nLepore\u2019s explanation,\u201d exclusion of Dr. Lepore\u2019s opinion is not warranted on this record. (D.I.\n\n259, Ex. F at 7319)\nTo the extent that Plaintiff challenges Dr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness opinion due to his\nreliance on a number of prior art references across several categories, Plaintiff's position goes to\nthe weight of the opinion, and not its admissibility. It is ultimately Defendants\u2019 burden to show\n\u201cby clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine\nthe teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention, and that the skilled\nartisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.\u201d Pfizer, 480 F.3d at\n1361 (citing DyStar Textilfarben GmbH v. C.H. Patrick Co., 464 F.3d 1356, 1360 (Fed. Cir.\n2006)). The failure to adequately identify specific obviousness combinations goes to this\nultimate burden of proof under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, and not to the admissibility of an expert opinion,\nas demonstrated by the fact that a majority of the cases relied on by Plaintiff did not arise in the\ncontext of a Daubert motion to exclude the opinion of an expert witness. See ProBatterSports,\nLLC v. Sports Tutor, Inc., 680 F. App\u2019x 972, 975 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (concluding that patents were\nnot invalid as obvious on a motion for summary judgment because the defendant\u2019s reliance on \u201ca\nslew of references in ten separate obviousness combinations\u201d did not satisfy the \u00a7 103 standard);\nMotorola Mobility, LLC v. Int'l Trade Comm\u2019n, 737 F.3d 1345, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding\nthat Motorola failed to present clear and convincing evidence of obviousness where it \u201cdid not\nclearly identify the scope and content of the prior art\u201d and did not \u201cprovide any argument that\ncertain prior art references render a specific claim obvious.\u201d); ActiveVideo Networks, Inc. v.\nVerizon Commc'ns, Inc., 694 F.3d 1312, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (finding evidence was\ninsufficient to support an obviousness determination on JMOL where expert\u2019s testimony bore\n\u201cno relation to any specific combination of prior art elements.\u201d); Intendis GmbH v. Glenmark\nPharms. Ltd., 117 F. Supp. 3d 549, 590-91 (D. Del. 2015) (holding after a bench trial on the\n\nmerits that defendants had not met their ultimate burden under \u00a7 103).\nPlaintiff's cited cases that do touch on the exclusion of an expert\u2019s opinion are\ndistinguishable from the facts before the court in this case. In Oxford Gene Tech. Ltd. v. Mergen\nLtd., 345 F. Supp. 2d 431, 441 (D. Del. 2004), the court determined that an expert\u2019s obviousness\nopinion was unreliable and therefore inadmissible under Rule 702. Nonetheless, the case is\ndistinguishable in several ways. First, the case was tried to a jury. Jd. at 438-39. Second, the\nexpert relied on \u201ccommon knowledge in the art\u201d for a particular claim limitation without\nproviding any underlying factual support for that assertion beyond \u201c[jJust my knowledge of the\nfield.\u201d Id. at 438. In contrast, Dr. Lepore provided extensive explanation and support for each\nreference identified in the expert report, and Plaintiff's complaints are directed more broadly to\nthe format of the prior art combinations in the report, as opposed to their factual underpinnings.\nThe same is true of Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. v. Guardian Indus. Corp., C.A. No. 09-515-SLR, 2011\nWL 4459606, at *1-2 (D. Del. Sept. 26, 2011), in which the court excluded an expert opinion on\nobviousness in a case to be tried to a jury after determining that the expert did not describe the\nstate or skill in the art.\n\nIn Innogenetics, N.V. v. Abbott Labs., 512 F.3d 1363, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the Federal\nCircuit upheld the district court\u2019s exclusion of an expert\u2019s obviousness opinion under Rule 26\nafter finding that the expert report \u201cmerely lists a number of prior art references and then\nconcludes with the stock phrase \u2018to one skilled in the art it would have been obvious to\nperform\u2019\u201d the claimed method. In contrast, Dr. Lepore\u2019s expert opinion provides factual details\nregarding each prior art reference and methodically evaluates the motivation to combine and\nreasonable expectation of success factors in view of those references. (D.I. 263, Ex. C)\nCritically, the Innogenetics court highlighted the fact that it would not be credible to expect a lay\n\njury to examine the prior art references and perform the obviousness analysis on its own.\n\n9\nInnogenetics, 512 F.3d at 1373. The degree of evidentiary support in the expert reports and the\nfact that the case will not be tried to a jury distinguish this case from Jnnogenetics.\n\nB. Motivation to Combine and Reasonable Expectation of Success\n\nPlaintiff submits that Dr. Lepore offered only conclusory statements without identifying\nany reasons why a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to combine the prior art\nreferences with a reasonable expectation of success. (D.I. 258 at 9-10) But a review of Dr.\nLepore\u2019s opinions and the applicable case authorities establishes that he adequately addressed\nwhy a person of ordinary skill in the art would be motivated to combine prior art references, and\nwhy they would have a reasonable expectation of success in doing so. (D.I. 263, Exs. C-D) Dr.\nLepore\u2019s opinion goes beyond conclusory statements, and it is grounded in acceptable sources,\nincluding the prior art references themselves. See Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348,\n1362 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (explaining that the motivation to combine relevant prior art teachings can\nbe found \u201cin any number of sources, including common knowledge, the prior art as a whole, or\nthe nature of the problem itself.\u201d). Cf TQ Delta, LLC v. CISCO Sys., 942 F.3d 1352, 1362 (Fed.\nCir. 2019) (explaining that \u201ca conclusory assertion with no explanation is inadequate to support a\nfinding that there would have been a motivation to combine\u201d).\n\nFor example, Dr. Lepore explains that a person of ordinary skill would recognize the\nneed for sufficient oral bioavailability in drug development, which would lead to the selection of\nExample 5 in the Kirin Publication as the lead compound because it is more orally active and has\na suitable number of H-bond receptors. (D.I. 263, Ex. C at \u00a7] 206, 227-29) Dr. Lepore then\nrepresents that a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to modify Example 5 of the\nKirin Publication by incorporating a spiro-cyclopropy! ring into the malonamide group to arrive\nat cabozantinib because it would be more metabolically stable without adding new H-bond\n\n10\nreceptors or increasing the molecular weight of the compound, among other reasons. (/d. at J]\n206, 234-38, 257) In support of these allegations, Dr. Lepore discusses the asserted prior art\nreferences as well as other references that would be known to a person of ordinary skill. (See,\ne.g., id. at JJ 217, 238, 255-56) In particular, Dr. Lepore discusses Lipinski\u2019s \u201crule of 5\u201d factors\nto assess bioavailability, which is an accepted analysis to establish a known motivation to\ncombine. (D.I. 263, Ex. C at ff 82-84, 227-28, 238); see Amerigen Pharms. Ltd. v. UCB\nPharma GmbH, 913 F.3d 1076, 1086-87 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (accepting opinion of defendant\u2019s\nexpert applying Lipinski\u2019s \u201crule of 5\u201d to determine that the lead compound in that case did not\nhave a bioavailability problem requiring modification, while recognizing that a motivation to\nmodify could exist in some cases despite the absence of a specific bioavailability problem).\n\nDr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness opinion also adequately identifies a reasonable expectation of\nsuccess in achieving the claimed inventions. For instance, Dr. Lepore represents that\ncyclopropane-bearing compounds were widely known to have antibiotic, antiviral, and antitumor\nproperties and were useful for inhibiting the activity of tyrosine kinases, and a person of ordinary\nskill would have reasonably expected that incorporating a spiro-cyclopropy] ring into the lead\ncompound \u201ccould create an irreversible c-Met inhibitor.\u201d (D.I. 263, Ex. C at J] 241-49, 255-59)\nThese explanations are sufficient to overcome Plaintiff's position that the opinions should be\nexcluded. See Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364 (\u201c[T]he expectation of success need only be reasonable,\nnot absolute.\u201d).\n\nC. Testimony Concerning the Inventors\u2019 Path\n\nIn the event that the court declines to preclude Dr. Lepore\u2019s opinion in its entirety,\nPlaintiff asks the court to exclude the portions of his opinion addressing the path taken by the\n\ninventors. (D.I. 258 at 11) In response, Defendants argue that Dr. Lepore\u2019s discussion of\n\n11\ninventor testimony and Plaintiff's development path permissibly show the level of ordinary skill\nin the art relevant to the claimed invention. (D.I. 263 at 18-19)\n\nPlaintiff's motion to exclude is granted with respect to the limited portions of the expert\nopinion that are based on internal documents and testimony from Plaintiff's witnesses. (D.I. 263,\nEx. C at \u00a7\u00a7 300-11; Ex. D at \u00a7{] 266-97) The Federal Circuit has stated that \u201c[t]he inventor\u2019s own\npath itself never leads to a conclusion of obviousness; that is hindsight. What matters is the path\nthat the person of ordinary skill in the art would have followed, as evidenced by the pertinent\nprior art.\u201d Millennium Pharms., Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 862 F.3d 1356, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2017)\n(quoting Otsuka Pharm. Co., Ltd. v. Sandoz, Inc., 678 F.3d 1280, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2012)). Dr.\nLepore clarifies that he did not rely on discovery and testimony from Plaintiff's witnesses in\nforming his opinions, but he nonetheless cites portions of the inventors\u2019 internal documents and\ntestimony which allegedly support his opinion. (D.I. 263, Ex. C at 300) As discussed at \u00a7\nI11.A-B, supra, Dr. Lepore addresses the bases for his obviousness opinion by relying on prior art\nand other permissible references, and the final paragraphs of his opinion discussing documents\nand testimony from Plaintiff's witnesses are not necessary to those analyses.\n\nDefendants\u2019 suggestion that these portions of the expert reports address the level of\nordinary skill in the art is not compelling. A review of the challenged paragraphs confirms that\nDr. Lepore included a discussion of Plaintiff's internal documents and witness testimony to\nconfirm the veracity of his own opinions. (D.I. 263, Ex. C at ff 300-11) The Federal Circuit has\ncautioned against \u201cus[ing] the template provided by the inventor, to render the inventor\u2019s\ncontribution obvious.\u201d Orexo AB v. Actavis Elizabeth LLC, 903 F.3d 1265, 1271 (Fed. Cir.\n2018) (citing Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil, 774 F.2d 1132, 1138 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). By\n\ndiscussing the internal documents and testimony of the inventors, Dr. Lepore blurs the line\n\n12\nbetween the inventor\u2019s work and the prior art, and also the person of ordinary skill and the\ninventor of exceptional skill in the art. \u201cThe invention must be viewed not with the blueprint\ndrawn by the inventor, but in the state of the art that existed at the time. The invention must be\nevaluated not through the eyes of the inventor, who may have been of exceptional skill, but as by\none of \u2018ordinary skill.\u2019\u201d\u201d Interconnect Planning, 774 F.2d at 1138.\n\nDefendants have not shown that the internal documents and witness testimony discussed\nin the expert opinions are limited to \u201croutine testing\u201d used to verify characteristics of a\npharmaceutical composition, as opposed to \u201cthe trial and error procedures often employed to\ndiscover a new compound[.]\u201d Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1364, 1367 (Fed. Cir.\n2007). While consideration of the former may be permissible \u201con the particularized facts\u201d of a\nparticular case, the Federal Circuit does not permit consideration of the latter. Jd.\n\nD. Commercial Motivation\n\nPlaintiff also argues that portions of Dr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness opinion run afoul of\nFederal Circuit authority by relying on commercial motivations, even where scientific\nmotivations pointed in the opposite direction. (D.I. 258 at 12) Notably, Plaintiff does not\nactually cite any Federal Circuit authority addressing this issue in either its opening or reply\nbrief. (/d. at 12-13; D.I. 265 at 9) In response, Defendants argue that reliance on commercial\nmotivations in an obviousness opinion is properly considered under the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in KSR, which recognizes that \u201cmarket forces can prompt variations\u201d of a design. (D.I.\n263 at 20) (quoting KSR, 550 US. at 418, 421).\n\nPlaintiff's motion to exclude portions of Dr. Lepore\u2019s obviousness opinion that discuss\ncommercial motivations is denied. By Plaintiff's own count, Dr. Lepore\u2019s discussion of freedom\n\nto operate and commercial motivation is limited to discrete portions of three paragraphs in his\n\n13\nopening report. (D.I. 259, Ex. A at J] 224, 235, 241) Plaintiff has not shown that maintaining\nthe content of these paragraphs will result in any prejudice, particularly in the context of a bench\ntrial. See APEX Fin. Options, LLC v. Gilbertson, C.A. No. 19-46-WCB-SRF, 2022 WL 613347,\nat *3 (D. Del. Mar. 1, 2022) (observing that \u201cthe court can simply disregard expert evidence that\nit regards as unreliable, irrelevant, or unhelpful.\u201d). Moreover, Federal Circuit authority suggests\nthat this is an issue that goes to the weight of an opinion, not its admissibility. See Amerigen\nPharms. Ltd. v. UCB Pharma GmbH, 913 F.3d 1076, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (concluding that,\neven if a commercial motivation could be shown, \u201csuch motivation would not be sufficient to\nprove that the claimed compounds would have been obvious.\u201d).\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED-IN-PART. (D.I. 257)\nSpecifically, the motion to exclude is GRANTED with respect to portions of Dr. Lepore\u2019s\nobviousness opinion that rely on the inventors\u2019 internal documents and testimony. (D.I. 259, Ex.\nA at JJ 300-11) The motion is DENIED in all other respects. An Order consistent with this\nMemorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nGiven that the court has relied upon material that technically remains under seal, the\ncourt is releasing this Memorandum Opinion under seal, pending review by the parties. In the\nunlikely event that the parties believe that certain material in this Memorandum Opinion should\nbe redacted, the parties shall jointly submit a proposed redacted version by no later than April\n27, 2022, for review by the court, along with a motion supported by a declaration that includes a\nclear, factually detailed explanation as to why disclosure of any proposed redacted material\nwould \u201cwork a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure.\u201d See Jn re\n\nAvandia Mitg., Sales Practices & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting\n\n14\nMiller v. Ind. Hosp., 16 F.3d 549, 551 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)). If the\nparties do not file a proposed redacted version and corresponding motion, or if the court\ndetermines the motion lacks a meritorious basis, the documents will be unsealed within thirty\n(30) days of the date the Memorandum Opinion issued.\n\nThis Memorandum Opinion is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections within\nfourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Opinion. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to five (5) pages each.\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: April 20, 2022\n\n"}
