(D.I. 1 at 5, 7)\n\nA district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\nof someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground\n\nthat his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). It is well-\nsettled that \u201cTs]tate courts are the ultimate expositors of state law,\u201d! and claims\nbased on errors of state law are not cognizable on habeas review. See Estelle, 502\nUSS. at 67-68. Notably, a district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition\n\u201cif it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it\nthat the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.\nAlthough presented in terms of a Fourteenth Amendment violation,\nPetitioner\u2019s challenge to the Delaware state courts\u2019 denial of his Rule 35 motion\nfor modification of sentence and his motion to subpoena medical records involves\nmatters of state law that do not provide a proper basis for federal habeas relief.\nAdditionally, to the extent Petitioner is complaining about the medical care he is\nreceiving in prison, the claims challenge a condition of his confinement and do not\nassert a proper basis for habeas relief. See Eiland v. Warden Fort Dix FCT, 634 F.\nApp\u2019x 87, 89 (3d Cir. 2015) (holding claims of inadequate medical care and\novercrowded prison conditions \u201cdo not sound in habeas corpus\u201d); Leamer v.\n\nFauver, 288 F.3d 532, 542 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n'Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975).\n2\nAccordingly, the Court will summarily dismiss Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 Petition.\nThe Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner\nhas failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L-A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, 113\n\nF.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order follows.\n\nDated: October || , 2022 hi Nid,\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n"}
