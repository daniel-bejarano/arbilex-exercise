( \u201cIMS\u201d) alleges that certain flash memory \nproducts sold by Defendant Micron Technology, Inc. (\u201cMicron\u201d) infringe  IMS \u2019s U.S. Patent Nos. \n7,000,063 ( \u201c\u2019063 patent \u201d) and 6,901,498 ( \u201c\u02bc498 patent \u201d).  Trial is currently scheduled for \nNovember 14, 2022.  \nPending before the Court are three motions raising a total of eight  distinct disputes: (1) \nIMS seeks partial summary judgment that IPR estoppel prevents Micron from relying on a \nparticular piece of prior art  (D.I. 291); (2) Micron seeks summary judgment that  (a) the asserted \nclaims of the \u02bc063 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, ( b) that the asserted claims of the \u02bc063 \npatent are either not infringed or invalid, ( c) that the  asserted claims of the \u02bc498 patent are not \ninfringed, (d) that IMS is not entitled to pre -suit damages for infringement of the \u02bc498 patent , (e) \nthat IMS is not entitled to damages for all worldwide sales of Micron\u2019s products , and ( f) that  \nMicron cannot  be held liable for the infringing acts of its subsidiaries  (D.I. 288) ; and ( 3) Micron    \n \n2 \n seeks to exclude certain testimony from  IMS\u2019s damages experts  (D.I. 285).

Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000).  \nB. Daubert    \nIn Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597  (1993), the Supreme \nCourt held that Federal Rule of Evidence 702 creates \u201ca gatekeeping role for the [trial] judge\u201d in \norder to \u201censur[e] that an expert \u2019s testimony bot h rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to \nthe task at hand.\u201d   Rule 702 provides : \nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, \nexperience, training, or education may testify in the form of an \nopinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert \u2019s scientific, technical, or other \nspecialized knowledge  will help the trier of fact to understand the \nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based \non sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable \nprinciples  and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the \nprinciples and methods to the facts of the case.  \nFed. R. Evid. 702.  As the Third Circuit has explained, \nRule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability a nd fit.  Qualification refers to the \nrequirement that the witness possess specialized expertise. We have \ninterpreted this requirement liberally, holding that \u201ca broad range of \nknowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert.\u201d  Secondly, the \ntestimony must be reliable; it \u201cmust be based on the \u2018methods and \nprocedures of science\u2019 rather than on \u2018subjective belief or \nunsupported speculation\u2019; the expert must have \u2018good grounds\u2019 for \nhis o[r] her belief.  In sum, Daubert  holds that a n inquiry into the \nreliability of scientific evidence under Rule 702 requires a determination as to its scientific validity.\u201d  Finally, Rule 702 \nrequires that the expert testimony must fit the issues in the case. In \nother words, the expert \u2019s testimony must be relevant for the \npurposes of the case and must assist the trier of fact. The Supreme \nCourt explained in Daubert  that \u201cRule 702\u2019s \u2018helpfulness\u2019 standard \nrequires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a \nprecondition to admissibility.\u201d  \nB y  m e a n s  o f  a  s o -called \u201cDaubert  hearing,\u201d the court acts as a \ngatekeeper, preventing opinion testimony that does not meet the    \n \n4 \n requirements of qualification, reliability and fit from reaching the \njury. \nSchneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried , 320 F .3d 396, 404- 05 (3d Cir. 2003) (footnote and \ninternal citations omitted).1 \nRule 702 \u201chas a liberal policy of admissibility ,\u201d Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237, \n243 (3d Cir. 2008) , as \u201cthe question of whether the expert is credible or the opinion is c orrect is \ngenerally a question for the fact finder, not the court ,\u201d Summit 6, LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co., Ltd., \n802 F.3d 1283, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  \u201cVigorous cross -examination, presentation of contrary \nevidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means \nof attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u201d  Daubert , 509 U.S. at 596. \nII. RECOMMENDATION S ON THE PARTIES\u2019 SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nMOTIONS  \nA. IPR Estoppel   \nI will first assess  IMS\u2019s motion for  partial  summary judgment .  IMS contends that Micron \nis estopped under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315 from relying on U.S. Pat ent No. 5,235,585 ( \u201cBish\u201d) as prior art \nagainst the \u02bc498 patent.  I agree.  \nSection 315(e ) governs inter partes review (IPR)  estoppel, which prevents IPR petitioners \nfrom raising argum ents in federal court that  reasonably  could have been raised during the IPR .  \nThe statute  provides, in pertinent part:  \n(e) Estoppel.\u2013 . . . ( 2) Civil actions and other proceedings.\u2013The \npetitioner in an inter partes review of a claim in a patent . . . that \nresults in a final written decision . . . may not assert . . . in a civil \naction  . . . that the claim is invalid on any ground that the petitioner \n \n1 The Third Circuit wrote under an earlier version of Rule 702, but later amendments were \nnot intended to make any substantive change.     \n \n5 \n raised or reasonably could have ra ised during that inter partes \nreview.  \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(e)(2).   \nMicron  was the petitioner in an IPR involving the \u02bc498 patent, but it did not raise B ish in \nthe IPR .  The Patent Trial and Appeal Board ( PTAB ) initially invalidated the claims  that are \ncurrentl y asserted in this action , but the Federal Circuit vacated that portion of the PTAB\u2019s decision \nbecause its claim construction was erroneous .  Innovative Memory Sys., Inc. v. Micron Tech., Inc., \n781 F. App\u2019 x 1013, 1018 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  On remand, the PTAB found the currently asserted \nclaims patentable.  Micron Tech., Inc. v. Innovative Memory Sys., Inc., No. IPR2016- 00330, 2020 \nWL 1581565 (P.T.A.B. Apr. 1, 2020).  Micron did not appeal the PTAB\u2019s decision.   \nMicron now wants  to make an  obviousness argument in this Court  that relies on Bish.   IMS \nsays that  Micron is estopped under \u00a7 315(e)(2) from relying on Bish because Micron could have \nraised that reference in the IPR.  Micron says that it did not previousl y know about Bish and that \na skilled searcher could not have found it prior to the IPR.  The parties agree that IMS (as the \npatentee asserting estoppel) has the burden of establishing that the requirements of \u00a7 315(e)(2) \nhave been met.  \nIPR estoppel  clearly extends at least to argument s about references  that the IPR petitioner  \nknew about when it filed its petition , even if the petition did not rely on those references .  Cal. \nInst. of Tech. v. Broadcom Ltd., 25 F.4th 976, 991 (Fed. Cir. 2022).   But I am not aware of, and \nthe parties did not cite, any clear guidance from the Federal Circuit about how to determine \nwhether an IPR petitioner \u201creasonably could have raised\u201d a n argument about a  reference that the \npetitioner now claims it didn\u2019t know about at the time of the IPR.   Several  courts, including courts  \nin this district, have  said that an IPR petitioner reasonably could have raised a particular piece of    \n \n6 \n prior art  where \u201ca skilled searcher conducting a diligent search \u201d would have found it .

Feb. 22, 2017), aff\u2019d, 721 F. App \u2019x 994 (Fed. Cir. 2018)  (affirming under \nFed. Cir. R. 36) ; see also Apotex Inc. v. Wyeth LLC , No. IPR2015- 00873, 2015 WL 5523393, at \n*4 (P.T.A.B. Sept. 16, 2015)  (\u201cWhat a petitioner \u2018 could have raised \u2019 was broadly described in the \nlegislative history of the America Invents Act (\u2018AIA\u2019)  to include prior art which a skilled searcher \nconducting a diligent search reasonably could have been expected to discover.\u201d (quoting 157 Cong. \nRec. S1375 (daily ed. Mar. 8, 2011)  (statement of Sen. Kyl ))).  But not much has been written \nabout  how thorough the  hypothetical diligent search must be.2   \nIn f\u2019real Foods , the court  found that a reasonably diligent search would not have uncovered \na Japanese utility model3 where the record demonstrated that the reference was not  accessible by \nstandard prior art search tools and no translation was available.  f\u2019 real Foods , 2019 WL 1558486, \nat *1 -2.  In contrast, in T rustID , the court concluded that a skilled searcher would have been able \n \n2 The \u201cskilled searcher conducing a diligent search\u201d language sounds a n awful  lot like the \nstandard for determining whethe r a reference is publicly accessible for purposes of 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 102 and 311(b), which says that a printed publication qualifies as prior art \u201cif it was \ndisseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that persons interested and ordinarily \nskilled in the subject matter or art, exercising reasonable diligence, can locate it.\u201d  Acceleration \nBay, LLC v. Activision Blizzard Inc., 908 F.3d 765, 772 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ; see also  Centripetal \nNetworks, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 847 F. App\u2019 x 869, 877 (Fed. Cir. 2021) .  Neither party has \nsuggested that the \u00a7\u00a7 102/311(b)  inquiry and the \u00a7 315(e) inquiry are the same, and I am unaware \nof any authority saying that they are.  \n \n3 According to the Japan Patent Office website, \u201cthe utility model system is  . . . designed \nto protect a device related to the shape or construction of articles or combination of articles. \u201d  See  \nhttps://www.jpo.go.jp/e/faq/yokuaru/utility.html  (last visited  Sept. 20, 2022).      \n \n7 \n to find a particular reference where (1) the patentee identified a search string th at, if used to search \nthe same subclass as the patent -in-suit, would have identified the reference,  and (2) the string \nincluded terms that appeared in the patent -in-suit numerous times.   2021 WL 3015280, at *1 \n(holding that a patentee asserting estoppel could demonstrate what  a reasonably diligent search \nwould have found by \u201c( 1) identif y[ing]  the search string and search source that would identify the \nallegedly unavailable prior art and (2) present [ing] evidence, likely expert testimony, why such a \ncriterion would be part of a  skilled searcher \u2019s diligent search\u201d) (quoting Clearlamp, LLC v. LKQ \nCorp., No. 12- 2533, 2016 WL 4734389, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 18, 2016)) ).   \nFor my part, I\u2019m not sure that \u00a7 315(e) leaves  any room for a  patent challenger  to argue \nthat it could not reason ably have raised an indexed, searchable U.S. patent in its prior IPR \nproceedings .  Indeed, Micron does not cite any case where such a failure was  ultimately  excused.4  \nBut I need not decide that  question here because I conclude that IMS has met its burden to show  \nthat a skilled searcher could have used search terms that would have found the disputed Bish \nreference  if run on the CPC G11 class, to which the \u02bc 498 patent -in-suit belongs .  (D.I. 331 \u00b6\u00b6 5 -\n10, Exs. A -F.)  Th e search terms proposed by IMS ar e straightforward \u2014\u201cblock,\u201d \u201cdefect,\u201d \u201czone,\u201d \n\u201creplace,\u201d \u201cassign ,\u201d and \u201clogical\u201d\u2014and they appear  in and relate to the subject matter of the \u02bc 498 \npatent .  The record before the C ourt reflects that e mploying various combinations of those  terms  \nto search the G11 class returns somewhere between 100 and 300 U.S. patents , including Bish .  (Id.) \nMicron  points to  the fact that , of the four searches  it conducted, the first three did not find \nthe Bish patent .  But Micron admits that it ultimately discovered  Bish through a conventional \n \n4 Micron cites  Palomar Technologies , Inc. v. MRSI Systems, LLC , 373 F. Supp. 3d 322, \n332 (D. Mass. 2019), but the court there held only that there was a dispute  of fact as to whether a \ndiligent  searcher would have found the  disputed ref erences at the time the IPR was filed.     \n \n8 \n keyword search, suggesting that it might  reasonably  have been identified earlier .  See, e.g., \nTrustID , 2021 WL 3015280, at *1 (\u201c[T]he fact that Defendant included [the disputed reference] in \nits invalidity contentions filed just several months after the IPR petition confirms that a skilled \nsearcher likely would have been able to find the reference.\u201d); Wi -LAN Inc. v. LG Elecs., Inc. , 421 \nF. Supp. 3d 911, 925- 26 (S.D. Cal. 2019) (successful search was evide nce that earlier unsuccessful \nsearches were not diligent when there wa s no reason the successful search could not have been run \nearlier).   Micron conspicuously does not provide  sufficient  details, such as an explanation of the \nsearch process, search terms , or hit counts from the first three searches , to enable the C ourt to \nassess whether those  searches were diligent.   (Tr. 200:1-6; D.I. 307, Exs. A, B .) \nNor has  Micron adequately  explain ed why it could not reasonably have  run the terms it \nused in the fourth search until after the IPR proceedings .  According to Micron, it did not find the \nBish patent until it included the search term \u201cslip\u201d in its search string, which Micron says it had \nno reason to do before the IPR .  (D.I. 307 at 3.)  Although the term  \u201cslip \u201d was never  mentioned \nduring the IP R proceedings by either the parties or the tribu nals, Micron contends that \u201cslip\u201d  \nbecame relevant during the IPR because IMS proposed a narrow  construction of a claim phrase \n(which the Federal Circuit ultimately agreed with), and that narrow construction apparently \nreminded someone on Micron\u2019s team (Micron doesn\u2019t say who) of \u201can old concept from the disk \nmemory era relating to \u2018slip.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 306 at 10; D.I. 307 at 3.)  At bottom, Micron\u2019s argument is \nthat it could not have been expected to uncover Bish because Micron thought that  the \u02bc498 claims \nwere broader than the IPR proceedings  determined them to be.   \nI reject that argument , for a number of reasons .  The main one  is that, w hile it\u2019s possible \nthat a patent owner might propose a claim construction in an IPR that could not have been    \n \n9 \n predicted , here the Federal Circuit has already held that IMS\u2019s proposed construction was correct.  \nUnsuccessfu l IPR petitioners cannot avoid IPR estoppel merely because they did not subjectively \nforesee the patentee\u2019s correct claim construction position.    \nMicron  argues  that there is a genuine dispute of fact about whether it \u201creasonably could \nhave discovered \u201d the Bish patent that prevents the Court from ruling on the application of IPR \nestoppel  on a summary judgment motion.  (D.I. 306 at 5.)   I disagree , for two independent reasons.  \nFirst, there is no hard fact in dispute .  Micron does not dispute, for exampl e, that it ultimately did \nfind that Bish patent with a keyword search  and that it also could have been located using the terms \nproposed by IMS .  Even accepting as true that Micron \u2019s first three searches did not uncover Bish, \nMicron has provided no evidence of what search terms it used  so that its diligence can be assessed.   \nSee, e.g., Wi -LAN Inc. , 421 F. Supp. 3d at  926 (granting patentee\u2019s motion for summary judgment \nof IPR estoppel where it was undisputed that the patent c hallenger ultimately discovered the \nchallenged references through a prior art search, notwithstanding the patent challenger\u2019s evidence \nthat it did not come into possession of the references until after the IPR).  Nor has Micron tried to \nshow that IMS\u2019s pro posed terms would not have been part of a diligent search.   \nSecond, e ven if there were a material fact in dispute , courts in this district treat the \napplication of IPR estoppel  as a matter for the court .  See, e.g., TrustID , 2021 WL 3015280, at *1 \n(granting motion in limine to exclude a r eference under \u00a7 315(e) after finding that a skilled searcher \nlikely  would have been able to find it) ; f\u2019real Foods , 2019 WL 1558486, at *1 (denying motion in \nlimine to exclude a reference under \u00a7 315(e) after finding that a skilled searcher would not have    \n \n10 \n found it) .5  Whether the issue is styled as a motion for summary judgment, a motion in limine, a \nmotion to strike contentions or expert reports, or even a motion for IPR estoppel, the question is \nthe same: could the IPR petitioner reasonably have raised the ground during the IPR.  Sending that \nquestion to the jury would be contrary to one of the  purpose s of IPR estoppel , which is to \nstreamline litigation , not to further complicate  already complicated  trials  by sending questions \nabout the  reasonableness of prior art searches to the jury.   \nFor these reasons, I agree with IMS that Micron reasonably could have raised Bish in the \nIPR.  As Micron has made  no other argume nt against  granting IMS\u2019s motion,6 I recommend that \nit be granted and that Micron be estopped from relying on Bish.   \nB. \u02bc063 P atent : Non-infringement or, A lternatively,  Invalidity U nder \u00a7\u00a7  102/103 \nI now turn to Micron\u2019s motion for summary judgment.  I start with Micron \u2019s second \nargument, tha t the asserted claim s of the  \u02bc063 patent are either not infringed or invalid.  Micron \nsays that there is no material difference between its products and a  prior art  reference \u2014an \nunexamined Japanese publication by Eiichi.  According to Micron, it doesn\u2019t infringe under the \nCourt\u2019s claim construction.  But if it does infringe, then the claim is invalid over Eiichi.   For the \nreasons explained below, I recommend that the Court deny Micron\u2019s request for summary judgment. \nMicron is asserting claims 4 2-44.  I ndependent claim 42 recites:  \n \n5 But see Palomar Techs., Inc., 373 F. Supp. 3d at 332 ( denying summary judgment , stating \nthat \u201c[i] t appears that the issue of whether a skilled, diligent search reasonably should have \nuncovered a reference is a question of fact \u201d).   \n \n6 Micron has not a rgued, for example, that it should not be estopped from raising an \ninvalidity ground that includes Bish in combination with other prior art that  Micron could not \nreasonably have raised in the IPR.  \n    \n \n11 \n 42.  A method for creating a write -once memory device from \na write -many memory device, the method comprising:  \n(a) providing a memory device comprising a memory array \ncomprising a plurality of write -many memory \ncell[s]; and  \n(b) rendering at least some of the write -many memory cells \nin the memory array as write -once memory cells by \npreventing more than one write to said at least some \nof the write -many memory cells.  \nJudge Andrews held a claim construction hearing7 on November 3, 2020 and construed the \nlimitation \u201c rendering at least some of the write -many memory cells in the memory array as write -\nonce memory cells by preventing more than one write to said at least some of the write -many \nmemory cells, \u201d to mean \u201ccausi ng at least some of the write -many memory cells in the memory \narray to become memory cells that cannot be written to more than once. \u201d  (D.I. 149 at 6-11; D.I. \n154 at 2.)   Based on the parties\u2019 agreement, he also construed \u201c write -many device\u201d  and \u201cwrite -\nmany cell \u201d to mean an electronic storage device or memory cell \u201c to which data can be written \nmore than once .\u201d  (D.I. 149 at 6; D.I. 154 at 1.)   \nBoth Micron\u2019 s products and Eiichi, the prior art, are non- volatile memory devices where \nsome cells can normally on ly be written once.  But it is possible, through different means, to write \ncells in either device multiple times.  Eiichi\u2019 s device does not include all the hardware necessary \nto erase and rewrite cells, but cells can be written multiple times using a separ ate hardware device \n \n7 The purpose of the claim construction process is to \u201cdetermin[e] the meaning and scope \nof the patent claims asserted to be infringed.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d \n967, 976 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 (1996). When the parties have an actual \ndispute regarding the proper scope of claim terms, their dispute must be resolved by the judge, not the jury. Id.  at 979. The Court only needs to construe a claim term if there is a dispute over its \nmeaning, and it only needs to be construed to the  extent necessary to resolve the dispute. Vivid \nTechs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. & Eng\u2019 g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999).     \n \n12 \n called a \u201c tester. \u201d  (D.I. 290, Ex. 10 (Eiichi) \u00b6\u00b6 11- 12, 16- 17.)  In Micron \u2019s products, an internal \ncontroller prevents multiple writes to a designated one -time programable (\u201c OTP \u201d) area, but \nrewriting can be enabled (without separate hardware) by setting the device into a \u201c test mode. \u201d  The \ntest mode can only be enabled by setting a mode bit that is inaccessible to ordinary users.  (D.I. \n290, Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 206- 55.)   \nMicron argues that ei ther both its products and Eiichi meet the elements of the claims , \nrendering the asserted claims invalid, or neither do.  Micron argues, first and foremost, that its \nproducts cannot infringe claim 42 because the Court\u2019s construction that cells  \u201ccannot be w ritten to \nmore than once \u201d means that  rendering is permanent and there is no way to write those cells again.  \nAlternatively, Micron says that, if the Court \u2019s construction is broad enough to include  OTP cells \nthat can be rewritten with a special mode, then t he construction would also encompass the Eiichi \ndevice, making the claims invalid under  \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103.   \nIMS responds that the Court \u2019s construction that \u201ccells cannot be written to more than once\u201d \nis met by  a write -many cell that is rendered  write -once for a period, during which the cell cannot \nbe written to more than once, even though the cell may be put  into a test mode where it becomes \nwrite -many again.  In response to Micron\u2019s invalidity argument, IMS points out that the claim \ndoesn\u2019t just cover  a devi ce with  write -once cells ; rather, it covers a device with write -once cells \nthat were originally write -many cells.  IMS argues that Eiichi does not disclose creating a write -\nonce device from a write- many device  as claimed because, unlike Micron \u2019s products, Eiichi \u2019s \ndevice was fabricated as a write- once device.   \nThe parties\u2019 dispute s are  genuine .  The question is, are they  legal dispute s about claim \nconstruction or material  dispute s about infringement and validi ty?  If they are disputes  about  claim    \n \n13 \n construction, the Court must resolve them  because they have  not yet been assessed : the parties \u2019 \nMarkman briefing did not present, nor did the Court decide, a ny dispute about whether the claimed \nstep of rendering cells so that they cannot be written to more than once requires that the change be  \npermanent in the sense that it cannot be reversed by the manufacturer, even though the cell  remains \nwrite -once in normal user operation.  Nor d id the parties \u2019 claim construction briefing present , or \nthe Court decide, a  claim construction dispute about whether the claims cover the testing of a  \ndevice that was fabricated as a write- once device.   \n Prior to the summary judgment hearing, I requested supplemental briefing on the  issue of \nwhether Micron\u2019s motion raised claim  construction disputes that may not have been contemplated \nand resolved by Judge Andrews\u2019s claim construction opinion and order .  Micron insists that the \nfirst issue \u2014whether \u201crenderi ng . . . write -once\u201d  must be permanent \u2014is not about construction and \nthe Court should not further construe that term.  (D.I. 351 at 2.)  IMS agrees.  ( Id.)  As to the \nsecond issue \u2014whether the claims are broad enough to cover  the testing  of a device that was not \noriginally manufactured as a write -many device\u2014 both sides  want the Court to determine whether \nthe preamble of claim 42 is limiting, but they agree that the C ourt should not further construe the \npreamble\u2019s  \u201cwrite -many memory device .\u201d  (Id. at 3.)   \ni. Micron\u2019s non -infringement argument  \n Micron argues that it is entitled to summary judgment of non- infringement  because there \nis no dispute that its products can be rewritten in test mode and the Court\u2019s construction of \n\u201crendering . . .\u201d re quires \u201ccausing at least some of the write -many memory cells in the memory \narray to become memory cells that cannot be written to more than once.\u201d    Micron points out that \nthe Court\u2019s construction does not say \u201ccannot be written to more than once [by a cus tomer] \u201d or \n\u201ccannot be written to more than once [outside of test mode].\u201d  (D.I. 289 at 13.)  That is true, but    \n \n14 \n the Court \u2019s construction also does not say \u201c causing . . . cells . . . to [permanently] become memory \ncells that cannot be [reconfigured  so that t hey can be]  written to more than once \u201d or \u201ccannot be \nwritten to more than once[, even by the manufacturer outside of normal operation].\u201d   As the movant \nrequesting summary judgment, it is Micron \u2019s responsibility  to identify any additional claim \nconstruction disputes that are material to granting its motion.  In light of Micron\u2019s insistence that \nthe phrase requires no additional construction, to obtain summary judgment, Micron would have \nto show that IMS \u2019s evidence of infringement is  actuall y inconsistent with the Court \u2019s construction.  \nBecause the Court did not address in its construction opinion whether the rendering must be \npermanent , I cannot say that IMS \u2019s infringement  evidence  is actually inconsistent.  ( See, e.g. , D.I. \n310 \u00b6 \u00b6 73, 77- 78, 95.)  \nMicron says, alternatively, that the \u201crendering . . .\u201d limitation is not met because the Court \nconstrued it as an  \u201cunqualified negative limitation \u201d that cannot, as a matter of law, be limited to \n\u201ccertain operational modes.\u201d  (D.I. 351 at 2; see also  D.I. 327 at 5 (citing Nash v. Microsoft Corp., \nNo. 3- 1667, 2005 WL 5912091, at *11 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 1, 2005), aff\u2019d , 173 F. App\u2019x 828 (Fed. \nCir. 2006) ); D.I. 289 at 13 (citing Power Integrations, Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int'l, Inc., \n843 F.3d 1315, 1336- 38 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ).)  There are multiple  problems with that argument.  The \nbiggest is that it relies on a faulty premise: Judge Andrews\u2019s Markman opinion did not consider \nwhether the rendering limitation was an \u201cunqualified\u201d negative limitatio n.  And w hile it is true that \na product cannot  infringe if it includes an element that is  expressly  excluded from the scope of the    \n \n15 \n claims, see Kustom Signals, Inc. v. Applied Concepts, Inc., 264 F.3d 1326, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001),  \nhow much a negative limitation excludes is  itself  a question of construction.8    \nIn short , the situation here is this :  The Court has already construed the relevant limitation.   \nMicron, the party requesting summary judgment , says that there is no further claim construction \nissue that needs resolution.  IMS has evidence of infringement that is not inconsistent with the \nCourt\u2019s  construction.  The jury can decide whether Micron\u2019s evidence is sufficient to establish  \ninfringement.  Micron\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non- infringement should be denied. \nii. Micron\u2019s invalidity argument  \nIf the  Court denies  Micron\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non -infringement, it must \nreach  Micron\u2019s alternative request for  summary judgment that the asserted claims are invalid over \nEiichi.  Micron says that Eiichi disclose s the step of \u201ccausing at least some of the write- many \nmemory cells in the memory array to become memory cells that cannot be written to more than \nonce \u201d because it discloses  writing and erasing cells in a memory device  using separate tester  \nhardware .  According to Micron, once the tester is removed from the Eiichi memory device, \u201c it is \ntaken out of the write -many test mode and becomes a write- once device.\u201d  (D.I. 327 at 7.)  IMS \nresponds that the Eiichi device is manufactured as a write- once memory device and  Eiichi thus \n \n8 Another problem with Micron\u2019s position is that it points to a rule about the legal effect of \nexclusionary language in claims and a ttempts to extend that rule to the language the Court adopted \nin its construction.  The Court\u2019s decision to use certain language in its claim construction does not \ninvoke doctrinal rules that would apply to the original claim language.  Constructions do not follow the same conventions and formalities as claim language, which is one reason courts construe claims in the first place.  The Court\u2019s construction is meant to inform a lay jury how to interpret the claims, which is why it uses non- technical words like \u201ccannot.\u201d  As explained above, the parties \ndid not present a dispute to Judge Andrews about whether causing cells to become memory cells \nthat \u201ccannot \u201d be written to more than once mean s that the cells could not be re -written by the \nmanufacturer outside of normal operation by a user.     \n \n16 \n does not disclose creating a write -once memory device from a write- many memory device, as \nrequired by the preamble of independent claim 42. \nThe parties present this dispute to the Court as being about whether the preamble of claim \n42\u2014\u201cA method for creating a write -once memory device from a write -many memory device\u201d \u2014\nis limiting.   The parties did not raise this dispute during the prior  Markman proceedings .  However, \nin accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement, the Court did construe  \u201cwrite -many [memory] device,\u201d \nwhich appears only in the preamble .  (D.I. 154 at 1.)   In their supplemental letter to the Court, the \nparties agree that the Court now needs to decide  whether the preamble is  limiting.  (D.I. 351 at 3.)   \n The way th e parties present this dispute to the Court raises questions .  As an initial matter, \nI\u2019m not sure what, if anything, the preamble \u2019s \u201cwrite -many memory device\u201d adds to the claim.  \nThe body of claim 42 already requires \u201ca memory device comprising a memory array comprising \na plurality of write -many memory cell[s] .\u201d  I don\u2019t know if  a person of skill in the art would see a  \ndifference between the preamble\u2019s \u201cwrite- many memory device\u201d an d the body\u2019s  \u201cmemory device \ncomprising a memory array comprising a plurality of write -many memory cell[s] .\u201d9  Moreover, it \nappears to me that the real dispute  here is about whether the claimed \u201cwrite- many memory cells\u201d \n \n9 The following exchange occurred at the summary judgment hearing:  \nCOURT: I guess we\u2019re a little confused about why we\u2019re arguing about the preamble. . . . \n[I]s the preamble really adding anything? The body of the claim still requires a \nwrite -many memory cell.  Isn\u2019t what you\u2019 re getting at that this prior art [Eiichi] \ndevice isn\u2019t a write -many memory cell?  \n[IMS]: Fair point. We do say that the preamble is what makes it clear, that it clearly \ninformed what the providing step in the claim means, that you do have to start out with a write -many memory device and Eiichi is not a write -many memory device.  \n(Tr. 58:16- 59:10.)  \n    \n \n17 \n would be understood by a person of s kill in the art to  be broad enough to include memory cells  \nthat can only be written to once unless they are connected to specialized hardware.  \n That said, I will resolve  the dispute as the parties have presented it to me.  The Federal \nCircuit has often stated  that \u201cas a general rule preamble language is not treated as limiting .\u201d  Aspex \nEyewear, Inc. v. Marchon Eyewear, Inc. , 672 F.3d 1335, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  But it has also \nrepeatedly stated  that \u201cthere is no \u2018litmus test\u2019 for determining whether a preamble is limiting .\u201d  \nEli Lilly & Co. v. Teva Pharm. Int\u2019l GmbH , 8 F.4th 1331, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2021)  (citing Bicon, Inc. \nv. Straumann Co., 441 F.3d 945, 952 (Fed. Cir. 2006)) .  In contrast to apparatus and composition \nclaims , which cover what a devic e or composition is, not what it does, method claims are often \ndirected to what the  method does.  And what a method does is often in the preamble , which \u201ctend[s] \nto result in a conclusion that such pre amble language is limiting .\u201d  Id.  at 1341; Boehringer \nIngelheim Vetmedica, Inc. v. Schering- Plough Corp., 320 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  \nUltimately, \u201c[w]hether to treat a preamble as a claim limitation is determined on the facts of each \ncase in lig ht of the claim as a whole and the invention described in the patent.\u201d   Eli Lilly , 8 F.4th \nat 1340 (citing Storage Tech. Corp. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 329 F.3d 823, 831 (Fed. Cir. 2003)) ; \nCorning Glass Works v. Sumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\u201c The \neffect preamble language should be given can be resolved only on review of the entirety of the \npatent to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to encompass \nby the claim. \u201d). \nI agree with IMS t hat the preamble is limiting.  A sserted claim 42 is a method claim , not \nan apparatus claim .  The preamble refers to  a method of  converting a write -many device to a write -\nonce device, consistent with the specification\u2019s focus on starting with a write -many device and    \n \n18 \n then limiting the number of writes.  (E.g., \u02bc063 patent , Abstract, 1:12- 18, 1:38- 40, 1:47- 53, 4:1-\n6:52.)  Indeed, the title of the patent is \u201cWrite -Many Memory Device and Method For Limiting a \nNumber of Writes to the Write -Many Memory Device.\u201d   Having reviewed the  claim in view of \nthe entirety of the patent, I conclude  that the inventors \u201cinvented and intended to encompass by \nthe claim\u201d  a method of  converting a write -many device to a write- once device.  Corning Glass \nWorks , 868 F.2d at 1257.   \nHaving concluded that the preamble is limiting, the parties do not request any further  \nconstruction of \u201cwrite -many  [memory ] device ,\u201d which the Court previousl y construed based on \nthe parties\u2019 agreement to mean \u201can electronic storage device to which data can be written to more \nthan once.\u201d  (D.I. 154 at 1.)    \nMicron  nevertheless  argues that  it is entitled to summary judgment of invalidity  because \nEiichi\u2019s device  becomes a write -many device when it is connected to  the tester  and is rendered a \nwrite -once device when the tester is removed.  IMS responds that the write -many memory device \nrecited in the preamble is only met by a device that  was fabricated as a write -many memory device , \nwhich Eiichi does not disclose . \n As the movant requesting summary judgment, it is Micron \u2019s responsibility  to identify any \nclaim construction disputes that are material to granting its motion.  In light of Micron\u2019s failure to \nrequest additional construction, to obtain summary judgment, Micron would have to show that \nIMS\u2019s evidence  that Eiichi does not disclose  converting a write -many device  to a write -once device  \nis inconsistent with the  Court\u2019s current construction.  Because t he parties have never asked the \nCourt to resolve a claim construction dispute about whether a \u201cwrite -many memory device\u201d  \nincludes a devi ce that is rendered write- many only transiently when connected to other hardware,    \n \n19 \n I cannot say that IMS\u2019s evidence about what Eiichi discloses is inconsistent.10  (See, e.g., D.I. 310 \n\u00b6\u00b6 105-06.)  The jury can decide.  Micron\u2019s request for summary judgment  of invalidity of the \nasserted claims of the \u02bc063 patent  should be denied.11 \nC. \u02bc063 P atent : Invalidity  Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 \nI now turn back to Micron \u2019s first argument , which  is that the Court  should grant summary \njudgment that the asserted claims of the \u02bc 063 patent are  invalid under  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 because \nthey are directed to ineligible subject matter.  I disagree.  \nSection 101 defines the categories of subject matter that are patent eligible.   It provides: \n\u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition \nof matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  The Supreme Court has recognized \nthree exceptions to the broad statutory categories of patent -eligible subject matter: \u201claws of nature, \nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas\u201d are not patent -eligible.  Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175, \n185 (1981).  \u201cWhether a claim recites patent -eligible subject matter is a question of law which may \n \n10 To be clear, I am not suggesting that Eiichi does not disclose a \u201cwrite -many memory \ndevice\u201d because it is only transiently a  \u201cwrite -many memory  device.\u201d   Rather, I\u2019m pointing out \nthat the fact that it can only be rewritten transiently when used with other hardware may mean that \nit is not ever a \u201cwrite -many memory device. \u201d  \n \n11 Even if the Court disagrees that the preamble is limiting, it appears to me that there may  \nstill be a material dispute  over whether the claimed \u201cwrite -many memory cell [s]\u201d are satisfied by \ncells in a device that are  fabricated  as write -once cells  and can only be rewritten th ough use of a \nseparate tester , as in Eiichi.   (See, e.g., D.I. 310 \u00b6 105 ( \u201cBecause Eiichi starts with creating a write -\nonce memory device, it does not meet the limitation of creating a write -once memory device from \na write -many memory device that is manufactured to have a plurality of write -many memory cells, \nsome of which are r endered as write -once memory cells.\u201d) ; id. \u00b6 106 ( \u201cEiichi does not disclose \ncreating a write -once device from a write- many device with an array of write- many memory \ncells.\u201d); Tr. 6 1:24- 62:13, 63:7- 12.)

This first step requires the court to \u201cexamine the \u2018focus\u2019 of the \nclaim, i.e., its \u2018character as a whole,\u2019 in order to determine whether the claim is directed to an \nabstract idea.\u201d  Epic IP LLC v.

AT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed.

Rather, I a gree \nwith IMS that the claims are directed to a non -abstract improvement to the creation of a  write -once \nmemory device .  \n  At this stage in the development of \u00a7 101 law, it is widely acknowledged that there is no \nsingle, comprehensive definition of an abstract idea.   The Federal Circuit has instead suggested \nthat courts should compare the claims at issue to claims that have been considered in other \ndecisions .   \nOne line of cases, including Alice , holds that \u201cmethod[s] of organizing human activity,\u201d \nsuch as fundamental economic practices, are abstract ideas .  Alice Corp., 573 U.S. at 220- 21.  \nMicron does not suggest that this case is like those cases, and it is not . \nAnother line of cases is the \u201cdo it on a computer\u201d cases.  Those cases say that claims that  \nmerely  recite automating a previously known economic or other task th rough the process of  \ncollecting, analyzing, and displaying data are directed to abstract ideas.  See, e.g., Univ. of Fla. \nRsch. Found., Inc. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 916 F.3d 1363, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2019)  (claims directed to \ncollecting, manipulating, and displaying dat a); Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One F in. \nCorp., 850 F.3d 1332, 1340- 41 (Fed. Cir. 2017)  (same) .  The claims here are not like the claims in \nthose cases  because they do not  invoke  a computer being used merely as a tool to manipulate data  \nor to automate a previously known proces s.  Rather, the claims here are directed to a method of \ncreating a write- once memory device.  Micron relie s heavily on the University of Florida  case, but    \n \n23 \n that case invo lved a \u201cquintessential \u2018do it on a computer\u2019 patent ,\u201d 916 F.3d at 1367, and the \nasserted claims here are not \u201cdo it on a computer\u201d claims.    \nThe claims here are more akin to the types of non- abstract improvements to computer \ntechnology that the Federal Cir cuit held to be patent eligible in Enfish , 822 F.3d at  1335- 39, Visual \nMemory LLC v. NVIDIA Corp., 867 F.3d 1253, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2017), and Koninklijke KPN N.V. \nv. Gemalto M2M GmbH , 942 F.3d 1143, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  The \u02bc063 patent specification  \nexplains that, while write -many memory devices were known in the art, there was a need for  write -\nmany memory devices that controlled the allowable number of writes .  (\u02bc063 patent 1:12- 14, 38-\n40.)  And it teaches t hat the  process of creating a  write -once device from a write- many device  also \nresults in certain benefits and functionalities .  (E.g., id., 5:58- 7:14.)  By requiring the creation of a \nwrite -once device from a device having write -many memory cells , independent claim 42 recites a \nspecific way of creating a write- once dev ice that achieves the disclosed improvement.  \nMicron nevertheless suggest s that claim 42 is doomed to abstraction because it uses \nfunctional language .  It points out that the claim phrase does not specify any particular way of \ncausing  write -many memory cells to become write -once memory cells .  That is true, but the \nclaimed requirement  of making a device with write -once cells out of a device with write -many \ncells puts the sc ope of the claim squarely within what the specification teaches is the patent\u2019s \ncontribution to the art .  In other words, the claims do not simply recite, without more, the mere \ndesired result of creating a write -once device, but rather recite a \u201csufficien tly specific \u201d \nimplementation  for doing so: starting with a write -many device  and turning it into a write -once \ndevice.  Koninklijke , 942 F.3d at 1148- 1151  (holding that a claim reciting a \u201cvarying device\u201d that  \nperformed p ermutations that varied in time was not directed to an abstract idea even though the    \n \n24 \n claim did not specify how the permutations were modified in time) ; see also Visual Memory , 867 \nF.3d at 1260.   \nMicron cites a number of cases in which claims that employed functional language were \nheld to be abstract  but, unlike the claims here, those cases did not involve claims directed to a \nspecific improvement in computer functionality.  See, e.g., Free Stream Media Corp. v. Alphonso \nInc., 996 F.3d 1355, 1364 (Fed. Cir.  2021)  (claims reciting  providing targeted advertisements to a \nmobile phone \u201c do not recite an improvement in computer functionality\u201d); Dropbox, Inc. v. \nSynchronoss Techs., Inc., 815 Fed. App\u2019x 529, 535 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ( agreeing  with district court\u2019s \nconclusion that the asserted claim was directed to \u201cthe abstract idea of exchanging data using a \ncomputer\u201d) ; Univ. of Fla., 916 F.3d at 1367 (\u201cThis is a quintessential \u2018do it on a computer\u2019 \npatent[.]\u201d);  Two-Way Media , 874 F.3d at 1338 (\u201cC laim 1 manipulates data but fails to do so in a \nnon-abstract way.\u201d) . \nMicron has not shown that the asserted claims of the \u02bc063 patent are directed to an abstract \nidea.  I recommend that the Court deny its motion for summary judgment of invalidity under \u00a7 101.  \nD. \u02bc498 P atent: Non-infringement  \nMicron \u2019s third argument is that  its products  do not  infringe the  asserted  \u02bc498 patent claims  \nas construed by the Court .   I recommend that the Court deny Micron\u2019s request for summary \njudgment on this issue.  \nThree independent claims are at issue.  Claim 1 provides:    \n1. A memory system circuit, comprising:  \na memory comprising a plurality of blocks of non- volatile storage \nelements wherein the storage elements within individual \nones of the blocks are simultaneously er asable, and     \n \n25 \n a controller that controls programming of data into addressed \nblocks, reading data from addressed blocks and erasing data \nfrom one or more of addressed blocks at a time,  \nwherein the memory is organized into logical zones each comprised \nof one or more blocks for address translation, and  \nwherein the correspondence of blocks to zones is adjustable by [the] \ncontroller . \n(emphasis added).  Independent claim 11 likewise  requires that \u201cthe correspondence of  blocks to \nzones is adjustable by [the] contr oller,\u201d and independent claim 43 similarly requires that \u201cthe \ncorrespondence between physical blocks and logical address sections is adaptable by the controller \nin response to defects in the memory.\u201d   \n In the prior IPR proceedings , the Federal Circuit  reviewed  de novo  the PTAB\u2019s \nconstruction of th e \u201ccorrespondence\u201d limitations under  the \u201cbroadest reasonable construction\u201d \nstandard.  Innovative Memory Sys., 781 Fed. App\u2019x at  1015.  It held that \u201c[t]he term [s] require [] \nthat the controller can adjust zone boundaries such that blocks from one logical zone are shifted to another logical zone.\u201d  Id. at 10 16-17.  In so holding, it  rejected the PTAB\u2019s conclusion that the \nphrase s were broad enough to encompass the situation wh ere blocks that were never assigned to a \nlogical zone  are shifted into a logical zone.   Id. at 1016.  Consistent with the Federal Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in the IPR proceedings , in this case Judge Andrews construed the \u201ccorrespondence\u201d \nlimitations  to require , in pertinent part, that \u201cthe controller can adjust zone boundaries such that \nassigned blocks from one logical zone are shifted to another logical zone.\u201d  (D.I. 151 at 2 (emphasis \nadded) ; D.I. 147 at 11 -16.)   \nFor purposes of resolving this motion, there appears to be no dispute that the MX500 \naccused devices contain meta blocks that include a collection of blocks with logical addresses \nassigned to them.  When a block in a meta block fails, that meta block is re tired and any remaining    \n \n26 \n good blocks within the meta block are listed in a spare good block table  where the logical address es \nare removed .  Then, if another block in another meta block fails, those spare blocks can replace \nthe failing block.  (D.I. 289 at 19- 20; D.I. 308 at 21- 22; D.I. 327 at 9.)  IMS contends that the \n\u201ccorrespondence\u201d limitations are met when  a block that had a logical address assigned to it in one \nlogical zone is ultimately shifted to another logical zone, even if during the shifting  proce ss the \nblock was intermediately  moved to a spare good block table where the logical address was  \nremoved.  Micron argues that the MX500 product s cannot infringe the claims as construed because \nthere is no dispute that at the time the blocks  in the spare good block table  are moved to the new \nzone, they are not \u201cassigned blocks\u201d (because they do not have an assigned logical address) and \nthey are not  \u201cfrom one logical zone\u201d (because they are not part of any logical zone).   \nAs for the remaining P320h and P420m accused devices , there also appears to be no dispute \nfor purposes of this motion that those devices  shift hardware blocks in a  logical zone to replace \ndefective firmware block s in another logical zone , but in the process they enter an intermediate \nstate where they lose their logical address es.  (D.I. 289 at 21; D.I. 308 at 22- 23; D.I. 327 at 9.)  \nIMS contends that the \u201ccorrespondence\u201d limitations  are met even though the blocks enter the  \nintermediate state where they lack  logical address es.  Micron argues that the P320h and P420m \nproducts cannot infringe the claims as construed because there is no dispute that at the time they \nenter the new zone, t he blocks are not \u201cassigned blocks\u201d because they do not have logical \naddresses . \nThe parties\u2019 dispute centers on whether the \u201ccorrespondence\u201d limitations are broad enough \nto encompass the situation where a block is  originally assigned to a logical zone, enter s an \nintermediate state where it loses its logical addres s and zone , and then move s into a  new logical    \n \n27 \n zone.  The Federal Circuit\u2019s opinion in the IPR proceedings did not address that  question; the court \nthere considered only whether the claims covered the shifting of blocks that were never assigned \nto a logical zone .  (See D.I. 133 (Revised Joi nt Claim Construction Br.  at 27 ( Micron: \u201c [T]he \n[Federal Circuit] reviewed only the single issue that the [PTAB] considered, namely, whether the \nclaim term \u2018 is broad enough to encompass both the situation where blocks are assigned to zones  \nand the situatio n where the blocks are not yet assigned.\u2019\u201d (citing Innovative Memory Sys ., 781 F. \nApp\u2019x at 1016) ).)  The parties have never  present ed to this Court , and this Court has never resolved , \na claim construction dispute that would dictate the outcome of  the current dispute .  (D.I. 149 at 13-\n16.)   \nI asked the parties  if there was a latent claim construction dispute that needed resolution.  \nBoth sides told me that no additional construction was necessary.  (D.I. 351 at 3- 4.)   \nIn light of the parties \u2019 agreement that there are no latent claim construction disputes , \nMicron\u2019s summary judgment motion should be denied.  Micron\u2019s argument  for summary judgment  \nis premised on its contention that the Court\u2019s construction excludes  methods  of shifting  blocks \nwher e the blocks  enter an intermediate state where they lack logical address es.  But  the Court has \nnever so held, and nothing in the Court\u2019s  construction supports such a limitation.  The jury can \ndecide if Micron\u2019s products infringe.  I recommend that the Cour t deny Micron\u2019s request for \nsummary judgment of non- infringement of the \u02bc498 patent. \nE. No P re-suit D amages  \nMicron \u2019s fourth argument is that  IMS cannot obtain pre -suit damages for infringement of \nthe \u02bc498 patent because a prior owner of the patent failed to mark products that embody it .  I agree \nthat Micron is entitled to partial summary judgment on this issue.     \n \n28 \n The patent marking statute, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(a), provides in relevant part that when a \nplaintiff  makes or sells a product practicing its  patent, the plaintiff can only recover  pre-suit \ndamages from an infringer if (1) the patentee marked its product in the manner specified in \u00a7  287(a) \nor (2) the patentee notifie d the infringer of its infringement.  E ven if a plaintif f patentee doesn\u2019t \nmake or sell anything, it cannot recover  pre-suit damages (absent providing notice) if a prior owner \nof the patent failed to mark its products  covered by the patent .  See Horatio Washington Depot \nTechs. LLC v. Tolmar, Inc., No. 17- 1086- LPS, 2019 WL 1276028, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 20, 2019).   \nBecause the markin g requirement of \u00a7 287 is a condition of damages, not an affirmative \ndefense, the patentee bears the burden of proving compliance, e ither by showing that t he relevant \nproducts were  marked or by showing that they did not practice the patent.  Arctic Cat Inc. v. \nBombardier Rec. Prods. Inc., 876 F.3d 1350, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  However, t o give reasonable \nboundaries to the patentee\u2019s  burden of proof , the Federal Circuit has imposed a limited initial \nburden on accused infringers : they must identify the articles  sold that allegedly embody the patents.  \nId. at 1368.  The accused infringer\u2019s  burden is not a burden of  proof or persuasion; it is merely a \nprocedural burden to provide notice of the identity of products that it believes required marking.  \nId. (\u201cTo be clear, this is a low bar.\u201d).   \nIMS does not dispute that it did not give Micron pre -suit notice of infringement .  IMS also \ndoes not dispute that Micron identified two unmarked and allegedly patented products sold by the \nprior owner of the \u02bc498 patent, SanDisk , before IMS filed this suit in 2014.  Thus, i f the identified \nSanDisk products are covered by the \u02bc498 patent and SanDisk failed to mark them  when it owned \nthe patent , IMS is  barred from recovering pre -suit damages.     \n \n29 \n IMS contends that  there is a genuine dispute over whether either of  the identified SanDisk \nproducts actually practiced the  \u02bc498 patent.  Because IMS has the burden of proof on this issue, in \norder to avoid summary judgment  it must point to evidence in the record from  which a jury might \nfind that the SanDisk products do not embody the \u02bc498 patent.  Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n767 F.3d 247, 265 (3d Cir. 2014)  (\u201c[W]here a non -moving party fails sufficiently to establish the \nexistence of an essential element of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial, there is \nnot a genuine dispute with respect to a material fact and thus the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \u201d).   \nIMS has failed to do so.  Instead, it essentially seeks to shift the burden of proof to Micron.  \nIMS points  out that (1) Micron\u2019s expert referred to SanDisk user manuals that described the \nproducts at only a high level  and do not establish  that they  meet the elements of the claims , and \n(2) IMS\u2019s expert said that \u201cthere is no evidence that any of the SanDisk product s [Micron \u2019s expert \nlisted]  engages in [ certain limitations required by the \u02bc498 patent claim s].\u201d\n12  Neither of those \nthings are evidence that the SanDisk products are not covered by the \u02bc498 patent.  IMS offered no \nevidence that the SanDisk products do not embody the \u02bc 498 patent.  And w ithout any evidence, \nthere can be no genuine dispute of fact .13  Accordingly, I recommend that the Court grant partial \nsummary  judgment that IMS cannot recover pre -suit dama ges for  infringement of  the \u02bc498 patent.  \n \n12 IMS\u2019s brief asserts  that its  expert \u201cconfirm [ed] . . . that none of the [SanDisk] products\u201d \nmeet certain  claim limitations  required by the \u02bc498 patent .  (D.I. 308 at 23; see also  Tr. 186:5 -8.)  \nIMS\u2019s expert  did not \u201cconfirm\u201d that.  He merely opined that \u201cthere is no evidence\u201d in the product \ndata sheets that the SanDisk products me et those limitations.  (D.I. 310 \u00b6 100.)   \n \n13  IMS suggested for the first time at oral argument that the SanDisk products identif ied \nby Micron might never have been sold.  That argument was not raised in the briefs and it is waived.  \nEven if it weren\u2019t waived, I would conclude that Micron met its burden of identification by \n    \n \n30 \n F. Foreign S ales \nMicron \u2019s fifth argument is that IMS is not entitled to damages for all worldwide sales of \nMicron\u2019s  products .  Micron points out that one of IMS\u2019s damages theories treats all of Micron\u2019s \noverseas  sales as infringing sales  even though there is no genuine dispute that  some of  those  \nproducts are m anufactured  and delivered  entirely overseas .  Micron says that because IMS has no \nevidence that those sales count as a sale or offer for sale in the United States  within the meaning \nof 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a), the Court should grant summary judgment that IMS cannot recover damages \nfor those sales.  I agree.  \nSection 271(a) sa ys, in relevant part , that it is patent infringement to \u201c make [], use [], offe r[] \nto sell, or sell[] any patented invention[] within the United States .\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a) (emphasis \nadded).  One of IMS\u2019s damages theories relies on a definition of Micron\u2019s revenues \u2014referred to \nas \u201cUS sales \u2013 least restrictive definition\u201d \u2014that \u201cassum e[s] that all sales are US sales and therefore \ninfringe.\u201d14  (D.I. 290, Ex. 18; see also id., Ex. 17 \u00b6 146.)  IMS points to no evidence to contest \nMicron\u2019s assertion that a substantial portion of its worldwide sales includes products manufactured \nand delivered entirely outside of the United States.  And IMS does not dispute that  the mere sale \nor offer to sell a product  outside of the United States cannot  constitute  patent infringement.  See \nHalo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 831 F.3d 1369, 1376- 77 (Fed. Cir. 2016) .  However, IMS \n \npointing to data sheets for commercial SanDisk products, wh ich permits an inference  that those \nproducts were in fact sold.  \n \n14 IMS\u2019s expert performed a separate calculation that relied only on the revenues for \nproducts that were either \u201cfabricated, assembled, tested or shipped in the U.S.\u201d  D.I. 290, Ex. 17 \n\u00b6 146 (referring to \u201c US sales \u2013 most restrictive definition\u201d) .  Micron\u2019s motion does not challenge \nthat calculation.  (Tr. 124:10- 125:22.)    \n \n31 \n contends  that there is a material dispute of fact regarding whether the wholly overseas deliveries  \nactually constitute sales within the United States  within the meaning of \u00a7 271(a) .   \n According to the Federal Circuit, wheth er a sale occurs  \u201cwithin\u201d the United States depends \non where the \u201csubstantial activities of [the] sales transaction\u201d occurred.   Id. at 1378.  \u201c[W] hen \nsubstantial activities of a sales transaction, including the final formation of a contract for sale \nencompassing all essential terms as well as the delivery and performance under that sales contract, \noccur entirely outside the United States, pricing and contracting negotiations in the United States alone do not constitute or transform those extraterritor ial activities into a sale within the United \nStates for purposes of \u00a7 271(a).\u201d  Id. \n In support of its argument that Micron\u2019s overseas sales constitute sales within the United \nStates, IMS points to evidence that Micron controls transfer pricing between its elf and its foreign \nsubsidiaries and that Micron\u2019 s domestic  sales team sometimes coordinates or supports its foreign \nsales teams.  (D.I. 309 Exs. J -O.)  I don\u2019t know if any profit Micron makes in the United States \nfrom the transfer of patented articles bet ween its subsidiaries would be subject to royalties under \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284;  that is not IMS \u2019s claim and I therefore do not address it.  But t he fact that Micron \ncontrols the pricing on its inter -corporate transfers is not evidence that Micron\u2019s overseas \nmanufactur ing and deliveries to customers constitute sales within the United States.  IMS \u2019s only \nevidence about where the substantial parts of Micron\u2019 s overseas  sales are performed is the \ndeposition testimony of Mr. Kilbuck, Micron\u2019 s corporate designee, who said that Micron \u2019s U.S. -\nbased employees  would sometimes support foreign sales teams by  \nsetting up a customer meeting[,] asking when the customer might \nwant to  get samples of a new product, ask[ing] for forecast, price \nnegotiations, [or] a whole host of road map discussions we wanted    \n \n32 \n to have with the customer.  They would facilitate lots of discussions \nthat, I would have somebody local to do it. \n(Id., Ex. N at 111- 12.)  \nViewed in the light most favorable to IMS , Mr. Kilbuck\u2019s testimony might permit an \ninference that some of Micron\u2019s foreign sales were supported by contracting and pricing \nnegotiations in the United States.  That is insufficient under Halo to raise a genuine dispute about \nwhether any particular overseas  sale constituted  a sale within the United States , much less all  of \nthem, as  IMS\u2019s \u201cleast restrictive definition\u201d  assumes.  \nAs IMS has made no other argument against granting Micron\u2019s request, I recommend that \nthe Court grant partial summary judgment that IMS cannot  obtain damages under its \u201cleast \nrestrictive definition\u201d of Micron\u2019s revenues.  \nG. Liability for A cts of S ubsidiaries  \nMicron \u2019s sixth requested basis for summary judgment  relates to its argument that it cannot \nbe held liable for the infringing acts of its  subsidiaries.  Micron points out that IMS\u2019s damages \ncalculations  include sales  made, not only by Micron Technology, Inc. (the named Defendant), but  \nalso by several of its  non-party subsidiaries .  Some of those non- party subsidiaries sell products \noverseas , and I have already recommended that IMS cannot recover  damages for those sales.  ( See \nSection II.F.)  However, Micron also has a U.S. subsidiary called Micron Semiconductor Products  \n(\u201cMSP\u201d),  and IMS\u2019s  damages theory includes U.S. sales made by MSP  as well as Defendant \nMicron .  (Tr. 153:9- 155:4.)  Micron wants  partial  summary judgment that IMS cannot obtain \ndamages for sales m ade by MSP.  I recommend that Micron\u2019s request be denied.  \nThe parties\u2019 briefing on this issue was sparse.  IMS does not rely on an alter -ego theory, \nand t he parties agree that Micron can only be liable for MSP\u2019s sales under an agency theory if    \n \n33 \n Micron \u201cinst igated\u201d those sales.   StrikeForce Techs., Inc. v. PhoneFactor , Inc. , No. 13- 490-RGA -\nMPT, 2013 WL 6002850, at *5 (D. Del. Nov. 13, 2013), as amended (Nov. 14, 2013).  IMS says \nthat there is a genuine dispute of fact about whether Micron instigated MSP\u2019s sal es, and it points \nto (1) an organizational chart showing that  Micron has 100% ownership of its subsidiaries  (D.I. \n309, Ex. P), ( 2) evidence  that MSP and Micron share a corporate address and have overlapping \ncorporate officers , (3) a distribution agreement between Micron and MSP under which MSP is \nrequired to use its best efforts to promote, market, and distribute Micron\u2019s products and Micron is \nrequired to defend MSP against claims of patent infringement ( id., Ex. J) , and (4) eviden ce that \nMicron in public statements refers to itself and its subsidiaries collectively as \u201cwe,\u201d and those statements suggest that Micron exercises control over the collective enterprise\u2019s manufacturing, \nmarketing, and sales .  (See id., Ex. O  \u201cWe manufactur e our products at our worldwide, wholly-\nowned and joint venture facilities. . . . We market our products through our internal  sales force, \nindependent  sales representatives, distributors, and e -tailers, primarily to original equipment \nmanufacturers and ret ailers located around the world.\u201d ).   \nI agree with IMS that the record contains e vidence sufficient to create a triable issue of fact \nfor the jury.\n15  Accordingly, I recommend that the Court deny Micron\u2019s request for partial \nsummary judgment. \n \n15 Micron points out that its distribution contract with MSP states that \u201c[t]he relationship \nof [Micron] and [MSP] established by this Agreement is that of independent contractors, and \nneither party is an employee, agent, partner or joint venturer of the other by virtue of this Agreement.\u201d  ( E.g., D.I. 309, Ex. J \u00a7 18(a).)  That contract language does not conclusively \ndemonstrate as a matter of law that MSP was not Micron\u2019s agent with respect to its U.S. sales.      \n \n34 \n III. ORDER ON MICRON\u2019S DAUBERT MOTION  \nFinally, I  turn to Micron\u2019s Daubert  motion  to exclude certain parts of IMS\u2019s expert witness \ntestimony.  Micron\u2019s motion will be granted.  \nIMS\u2019s damages expert, Dr. Putnam, performed a number of calculations to estimate the \nportion of Micron\u2019s profit s attributable to  the \u02bc063 patent .  His method included subtract ing from \nMicron\u2019s revenues certain production costs  and \u201ctreat[ ing] the remaining profit as having been \nproduced by a relatively small number of \u2018differentiating\u2019 innovations\u201d or \u201cfeatures.\u201d   (D.I. 287, \nEx. 1 \u00b6 \u00b6 135- 173.)  He then  performed an \u201canalytical exercise\u201d to estimate  the share of that profit \nthat should be attributed to  the one -time programmable (\u201c OTP \u201d) feature.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 137 -144.)   \n That analytical exercise included using a \u201c log-normal distribution ,\u201d which is a n assumption  \nabout how much more valuable some assets \u2014in this case patents \u2014are than others.  ( Id. \u00b6 186.)  \nThe theory has been reported in economic literature and it fits certain empirical data well.  ( Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 140- 141, 185-86.)  It describes how to estimate the value of a patent by its rank in a distribution \nof patents ranked by value, but the theory  does not tell us where a particular  patent falls  in the \ndistribution .  (Id.; D.I. 287, Ex. 7.)  For example, it says that the most valuable 10% of patents are, \non average, worth almost seven times as mu ch as the average patent, but it does not say which \npatents are in the top 10%.  (D.I. 287, Ex. 1 \u00b6 141.)   \nTo use that methodology to estimate  the share of profits attributable to Micron\u2019s OTP \nfeature, Dr. Putnam needed an estimate  about  where the OTP feature ranked  in value among the \nfeatures of the accused products .  To obtain that estimate , Dr. Putnam relied  on the opinion of Dr. \nWolfe, IMS\u2019s technical expert .  Dr. Wolfe  considered a handful of factors and, without explaining \nany methodology, opined that the OTP functionality was  \u201cin approximately the top 10% of \ncustomer -exposed features in the Accused \u02bc063 products.\u201d  (D.I. 287, Ex. 4 \u00b6 280.)       \n \n35 \n Dr. Putnam then made his own estimate of how many product features are in the top 10%  \nof Micron\u2019s features .  He  did that  by reviewing a data sheet for a M icron product  and making his \nown determination about how many features  it identifies .  (D.I. 287, Ex. 1 \u00b6 142; D.I. 313 \u00b6 17.)  \nNotwithstanding his lack of engineering expertise, Dr. Putnam opined that there were \napproximately \u201ctwo dozen\u201d features listed on the data sh eet, and he added a 50% fudge -factor to \nbe \u201cconservative ,\u201d ultimately estimating that there were 35 features in the product\u2019s top 10% of \nfeatures.   (D.I. 287, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 142-43.)  He then fit the OTP feature to the log -normal distribution \nand estimated a ran ge of values  for the OTP feature, depending on differing assumptions about \nwhere the OTP feature ranked in the top 10%.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 1 44-151).  \nIn his declaration attached to IMS\u2019s responsive brief, Dr. Putnam summarized how he \ncalculated the value for the OTP feature using an assumption that it ranked at the bottom of the 35 \nfeatures that he assumed constituted the top 10% of features :  \nTo estimate the value of the \u02bc 063 patent, ranked at the bottom of the \ntop 10% of Micron innovations, I employed a procedure I call \n\u201ccount, rank and divide\u201d ( [D.I. 287] Ex. A at \u00b6188- 89): count the \nnumber of innovations in the relevant group; rank them; and divide \nthe total value among them so that the parts add up to the whole. By \ncounting the num ber of  innovations in a group, I can compute the \naverage profit per innovation; by ranking them, I can compute a \nprofit multiplier for each innovation, relative to the group average; \nand by dividing the profits using that multiplier, I assign a share to \neach patent such that the parts add up to the value of the whole. \nAgain, the count, rank and divide procedure has  been approved in \npast cases, including in Delaware (Ex. A at \u00b6188 n.197 [citing LG \nDisplay v. AU Optronics , 722 F. Supp. 2d 466 (D. Del. 2010)] ).     \n(D.I. 313 \u00b6 16.)   \nI will assume for purposes of the argument only that the count, rank, and divide procedure \nis a reliable method for assessing the value of a feature claimed by a patent when that feature can \nreliably be placed in a \u201crelevant group\u201d and the number of other features in that group can reliably    \n \n36 \n be \u201ccount[ed].\u201d16  Micron nevertheless contends that Dr. Putnam\u2019s method for  \u201ccounting\u201d  how \nmany features are in the top 10% of features is unreliable .  I agree.  There is no question that Dr. \nPutnam is highly credentialed and has published papers in the field  of patent valuation.  But t he \nadmissibility test under Daubert  is not a competition to present the most qualified expert to offer \nan opinion on the economic value of patent s or features.  It is an inquiry into whether the particular \nopinion offered  was based on the reliable application of reliable methods.  Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner , \n522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997); Schneider , 320 F.3d at 404- 05.  The main  problem s for IMS are that the \nrecord does not demonstrate that Dr. Putnam has the scientific expertise to make an estimate about \nhow many technical features are described  on the product data sheet , nor does the record \ndemonstrate that he used a  reliable methodology for counti ng the number of features .   The record \nalso fails to demonstrate that Dr. Putnam  used a reliable methodology or relied on any facts or data \nto conclude  that the features listed on the data sheet constitute the top 10% of features .17 \nMicron also takes issu e with Dr. Wolfe\u2019s opinion that OTP is in the top 10% of customer -\nfacing features, which Dr. Putnam relied on to conclude that OTP is therefore in the \u201crelevant \ngroup\u201d of the top 10% of features.  I don\u2019t think I need to reach this issue since Dr. Wolfe\u2019s estimate  \n \n16 Micron points out that the method of comparing the values of patents by ranking them \nis applied in economic  literature to apportion value betwee n patents, not to apportion value  \nbetween the features of a product.  Applying the  method to features in order to calculate profits \nattributable to an asserted patent raises several questions, including but not limited to how to count \nhow many features a p roduct has  and how to take into account the fact that a \u201cfeature\u201d may not be \ncoextensive with the asserted patent .  IMS did not identify any  case admitting expert testimony \nthat applied this or a comparable method to apportion profits between different fea tures of a \nproduct.   \n \n17 Paragraph 9 of Dr. Putnam\u2019s opening report states , \u201cAccording to Dr. Andrew Wolfe, \nIMS\u2019s technical  expert, Micron would advertise the top approximately 10% of its features among \nits NAND flash devices .\u201d  (D.I. 287, Ex. 1 \u00b6 9.)  Dr. Wolfe\u2019s expert report does not say that.    \n \n37 \n does not appear to have any independent significance aside from its  use in  Dr. Putnam\u2019s \ncalculations.  But I agree with Micron.  The record does not demonstrate that either expert used a \ndiscernable method to conclude that the OTP feature was amon g the top 10% of all relevant \nfeatures .  \nTo his credit, Dr. Putnam points out that the numbers he used for his calculations are only \nestimates , and that \u201cthere is no bright -line empirical test by which to define the exact number of \ndifferentiating features  or to separate \u2018ordinary\u2019 from \u2018extra -ordinary\u2019 innovat ions.\u201d   (D.I. 287, Ex. \n1 \u00b6 142.)  Th e mere fact that there is no definitive empirical method of calculating the value of the \n\u02bc063 patent is not a reason to permit testimony on a  mathematical  calculation that  uses inputs \nobtained from unreliable methods.  N umbers have power \u2014they sound authoritative and tend to \nmask  unreliable estimates and assumptions .   \nCourts have previously excluded opinions about apportioning value between pat ents \nbecause they assumed without explanation that all patents were equally valuable.  See, e .g., \nStragent, LLC v. Intel Corp., No. 11- 421, 2014 WL 1389304, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 6, 2014) (Dyk, \nJ.).  IMS distinguishes those cases because, here, Dr. Putnam had a very sound explanation of why \na log -normal distribution is a good model for the relative value of patents.  I take IMS \u2019s point, but \nI think Dr. Putnam \u2019s method requires even greater scrutiny to ensure that it is not misapplied.  \nUnlike the expert in Stragent , Dr. Putnam here is claiming that the OTP feature covered by the \n\u02bc063 patent is unusually valuable: two to seven times more valuable than the product\u2019s other \nfeatures .  (D.I. 287, Ex. 1 \u00b6 141.)  That claim requires evidence and reliable method s both for \nranking it in the top 10% and for counting other features in the top 10% .  IMS\u2019s experts offer \nneither .      \n \n38 \n IMS cites cases where courts in this district have allowed similar testimony .  In LG Display \nCo. v. AU Optronics Corp., a court in this district allowed Dr. Putnam to testify at a bench trial   \nabout his opinion that , if the asserted patents were among the most valuable 5% , the total damag es \nwere $7.8 million.  722 F. Supp. 2d 466, 472- 74 (D. Del. 2010) ; 265 F.R.D. 189, 195 (D. Del. \n2010)  (\u201c[T]he gatekeeping obligation provided for in Daubert  is less pressing in the context of a \nbench trial .\u201d).  But that was a bench trial, not a jury trial.  And the Court ultimately found that a \ndifferent  method of calculating damages was more appropriate  and awarded on ly $305,399.  722 \nF. Supp. 2d at 474.   Similarly, in Sprint Comms. Co. v. Charter Comms., Inc. , No. 17- 1734- RGA, \n2021 WL 982729, at *5- 6 (D. Del. Mar. 16, 2021), a  defense expert was allowed to testify that \neven if plaintiff's patents were each among the top 1% of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) \npatents, they would only be worth 12% of the overall value of VoIP.  That case merely shows that \nit can be appropriate for an expert to assume patents are the most valuable when calculating an \nupper bound for damages .  Dr. Putnam is not offering such an opinion here.  Contrary to IMS\u2019s \nsuggestion, the cited  cases do not  stand for the proposition that  calculations based on  arbitrary top \npercentage rankings are admissible  in a jury trial.   \nMicron raises a number of other arguments in support of excluding Dr. Putnam\u2019s damages \ntestimony, which I do not need to address in light of my conclusions above.  The testimony of Dr. \nPutnam and Dr. Wolfe will be  excluded to the extent that they opine  or rel y on a top 10% ranking \nfor the \u02bc063 patent  or OTP feature  and/or a calculation about how many features are in the top 10% \nof features.      \n \n39 \n IV. CONCLUSION \nI have carefully considered the remaining arguments and cases cited by the parties and \nhave determined that they do not warrant further discussion in light of the conclusions set forth \nabove.   \nFor the reasons stated,  I RECOMMEND as follows:  \n1. IMS\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment (D.I. 291) should be GRANTED ; and  \n \n2. Micron\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 288) should be GRANTED- IN-\nPART and DENIED -IN-PART : \n \na.  Micron\u2019s request for partial summary judgment that the asserted claims of \nthe \u02bc063 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 should be denied;  \n \nb. Micron\u2019s request for partial summary judgment of non- infringement  or, in \nthe alternative, of invalidity of the asserted claims of the \u02bc063 patent under 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103 should be denied;  \n \nc. Micron\u2019s request for partial summary judgment that the asserted claims of \nthe \u02bc498 patent are not infringed should be deni ed; \n d. Micron\u2019s request for partial summary judgment that IMS cannot obtain pre -\nsuit damages for infringement of the \u02bc498 patent should be granted;  \n e. Micron\u2019s request for partial summary judgment that IMS cannot obtain \ndamages  under its \u201cleast restrictive definition\u201d of Micron\u2019s revenues  should be granted;  \nand \n \nf. Micron\u2019s request for partial summary judgment that it cannot be held liable \nfor the infringing acts of its subsidiaries  should be denied.  \n \n Further, fo r the reasons stated, I ORDER as follows:   Micron\u2019s motion to exclude (D.I. \n285) is GRANTED.  The testimony of Dr. Putnam and Dr. Wolfe will be excluded to the extent \nthat they opine or rely on a top 10% ranking for the \u02bc063 patent or OTP feature and/or a calculation \nabout how many featur es are in the top 10% of features.   40 The parties are directed to the Court \u2019s \u201cStanding Order for Objections Filed Under Fed.
