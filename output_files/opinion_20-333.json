Prop. Consultants, Inc. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. , 691 F. Supp. 2d 538, \n541-42 (D. Del. 2010); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b) (l)(C); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); \nNOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that (i) Vytacera\u2019s Objections (D.I. \n141) to Judge Burke\u2019s reco mmended constructions of \u201cinhibitor\u201d and \u201cinhibitor is administered \nalone or together with said antibody\u201d are OVERRULED and the constructions set forth in the \nReport (D.I. 130) are ADOPTED ; and (ii) CytomX\u2019s Objections  (D.I. 151) to Judge Burke\u2019s \nrecommended construction of \u201crecognition domain\u201d are OVERRULED and the construction set \nforth in the Report (D.I. 149) is ADOPTED . \n1. Vytacera objects to the recommended c onstruction of \u201cinhibitor\u201d as meaning \u201ca \nmolecule, separate from the [biologically active agent/anti body], having the ability to bind, \ninhibit, suppress, neutralize, or decrease activity of a [biologically  active agent/antibody].\u201d  (D.I. \n141 at 2-9)  This construction reso lved the parties\u2019 dispute as to whether the inhibitor can ever be \npart of the same molecule as the bi ologically active agent (\u201cBAA\u201d).  ( See D.I. 130 at 6)  Relying \non both the claim language and the patents\u2019 shared specification, th e Report concluded that the \ninhibitor and the BAA must always  be separate molecules.  ( See id. )  The Court agrees.  Notably, \nthe claims describe the inhibitor as having a component that takes an action \u2013 for example, \nbinding, inhibiting, or suppressing \u2013 that affects the BAA, which would indicate to a person of \nordinary skill in the art that the i nhibitor and BAA are distinct entities.1  (See \u2019504 patent cl. 1)  \nAs the Report states, \u201c[i]t is hard to conceive of how a first entity (the inhibitor) could be said to \n\u00a0\n1 In the \u2019913 patent, the \u201cbiologi cally active agent\u201d is an \u201canti body.\u201d  (\u2019913 patent cls. 1, 22)  \nThere is no dispute that the \u201canti body\u201d of the \u2019913 patent is a \u201cbiologically active agent\u201d as \ndescribed in the patents, and the Court\u2019s analysis applies equally to  the claims of both patents.  \n(See D.I. 130 at 6 n.3, 7)   Case 1:20-cv-00333-LPS-CJB   Document 155   Filed 05/09/22   Page 2 of 9 PageID #: 22573 \n \u2018inhibit\u2019 . . . a second entity (the  biologically active agent), if t hose two things were actually all \npart of the same chemical molecule.\u201d  (D.I. 130 at 7)  The specification provides further support.  \nThe patents\u2019 Abstract explains that \u201c[t]he invention relates to  molecules inhibiting biologically \nactive compounds\u201d (\u2019504 patent, Abstract), echoing the claim language and suggesting, again, \nthat inhibitors are distinct fro m BAAs.  The specification also describes the \u201c[i]nhibitor-ligand \npair\u201d (with \u201cligand\u201d used interchangeably with \u201cBAA\u201d) as a \u201c set of molecules,\u201d indicating that \nthe inhibitor and ligand (i.e., the BAA) ar e not part of the same molecule.  ( Id. at 5:36-37, 45-47)  \nAdditionally, the Cour t finds nothing in the claims  or the specification th at suggests the inhibitor \nand BAA are chemically attached  in the same molecule.  ( See D.I. 130 at 7-8)   \n2. As CytomX notes, Vytacera\u2019s Objections  have little to do with Judge Burke\u2019s \nactual analysis.  ( See D.I. 145 at 1)  They do not, for exampl e, raise any specific issues with the \nReport\u2019s reliance on the claim language or specific  portions of the specification to support its \nconstructions.  ( See id. )  Having considered th e arguments Vytacera does raise, the Court finds \nnone of them persuasive.   \n3. First, Vytacera argues the patents\u2019 speci fication teaches that the claimed inhibitor \nand BAA can be a \u201cunitary molecule.\u201d  ( See D.I. 141 at 2-4)  As an initial matter, the Court \nagrees with CytomX that Vytacera has waived this  argument, as it is raised for the first time in \nconnection with its Objections and conflicts with its position before Judge Burke, where \nVytacera agreed that the claimed inhibito r and BAA are \u201cdistinct molecules.\u201d  ( See D.I. 145 at 5) \n(citing D.I. 136 at 15)  Vytacera has not shown good cause for raising this new, and inconsistent, \nargument at this stage.2  In any event, Vytacera\u2019s argument also fails on the merits.  Vytacera \n\u00a0\n2 In its Certification pursuant to  the Court\u2019s October 9, 2013 Sta nding Order for Objections Filed \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 72, Plaintiff states that  it has good cause to bring these new arguments \nbecause they \u201care related solely to points and comments discussed during the \u00a0August 23, 2021 Case 1:20-cv-00333-LPS-CJB   Document 155   Filed 05/09/22   Page 3 of 9 PageID #: 22584 \n appears to argue that the speci fication\u2019s disclosure of molecu les \u2013 for example, a catalytic \nantibody \u2013 that can serve as either an inhibitor or a BAA amounts to a disclosure that a single \n\u201cunitary\u201d molecule can simultaneo usly serve those two roles.  ( See id. at 5-6)  The Court agrees \nwith CytomX, however, that the disclosure of su ch molecules provides no ba sis to conclude that \nthe claimed  inhibitor and BAA are a \u201c unitary molecule.\u201d  ( See id.  at 6) (\u201cPut simply, that a \ncertain type of molecule can po ssibly serve either of two roles (i.e., BAA or inhibitor) does not \nanswer whether, as a matter  of claim construction, a single \u2018unitary\u2019 molecule can \nsimultaneously serve those two roles in the claimed  invention.\u201d)   \n4. Vytacera\u2019s reliance on the patents\u2019 sp ecification to argue that the claimed \ninhibitor and BAA can be chemically attached is  equally unsuccessful.  The Court agrees with \nCytomX that the term \u201coperabl y linked\u201d describes the connecti on between the inhibitor\u2019s first \nand second moieties \u2013 not a connection be tween the inhibitor and the BAA.  ( See id. at 7)  Next, \nVytacera points to a preferred embodiment in which the active agent or active compound (both \npurportedly interchangeable with BAA) can include a cytotoxic pr otein.  (D.I. 141 at 5) (citing \n\u2019504 patent at 7:48-50, 8:60-66)  Since covalent attachme nt (or a chemical union) can be \naccomplished by such a protein, Vytacera argues this preferred embodiment provides further \nsupport for the notion that the claimed inhibitor and BAA can be chemically attached.  ( Id. at 4-\n5)  Vytacera also points to another portion of the specification disc ussing \u201ca post-cleavage \ncytotoxic agent derivative\u201d that can be attach ed to a linker unit, which can also accomplish \ncovalent attachment.  ( See id. ) (citing \u2019504 patent at 31:11-15)  As CytomX notes, however, that \npassage never refers to the referenced cytotoxi c agent as a BAA; nor does the passage speak to \n\u00a0\nMarkman  hearing.\u201d  The Court is not persuaded by this assertion.  Moreover, Vytacera fails to \nidentify the new arguments it advances \u2013 as re quired by the Standing Order \u2013 placing the burden \non Defendant and the Court to do so.  ( See D.I. 145 at 9 n.5) Case 1:20-cv-00333-LPS-CJB   Document 155   Filed 05/09/22   Page 4 of 9 PageID #: 22595 \n the relationship between the claimed inhibitor and the BAA.  ( See D.I. 145 at 7-8)  The Court \nagrees with CytomX that these \u201ccherry-picked\u201d  excerpts from the specif ication do not provide \nsignificant support for Vytacera\u2019s position.  ( See id. )  \n5. Vytacera next faults the Report for not including the claimed second moiety in its \nconstruction of \u201cinhibitor.\u201d  ( See D.I. 141 at 6-7)  There is no dis pute, however, that the inhibitor \nmust have a second moiety.  ( See D.I. 145 at 8) (\u201cCytomX does not contest that the inhibitor, as \nconstrued, must meet the additi onal limitations of the claims, which require first and second \nmoieties.\u201d)  Judge Burke\u2019s construction did not  \u201cignore\u201d the role of the inhibitor\u2019s second \nmoiety; rather, it reasonably did no t address this uncontested point.   \n 6. Vytacera contends that expert testim ony is required to determine whether the \nclaimed \u201cinhibitor\u201d and BAA are ch emically attached, and the Court should therefore return this \nmatter to Judge Burke to reopen claim construction after expert discovery.  ( See D.I. 141 at 7-8)  \nAs CytomX points out, however, \u201cVytacera had every opportunity to present expert testimony \naccording to the deadlines set by the Scheduling Orde r and chose not to do so.\u201d  (D.I. 145 at 9)  \nNor did Judge Burke request expert testim ony or supplemental briefing after the claim \nconstruction hearing.  The Court agrees with Cy tomX and the Report that the intrinsic evidence \nwas sufficient to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute.  ( See id. )3 \n 7.  Vytacera argues CytomX\u2019s proposed c onstruction invited improper validity and \ninfringement analysis at this stage, pointing to  CytomX\u2019s reference to its accused product during \nthe Markman hearing.  (D.I. 141 at 8-9)  But CytomX\u2019s  passing reference to its accused product \nfalls far short of an admission that its addition of  the \u201cseparate\u201d limitation to its construction was \n\u201cnever centered on the claims,\u201d as Vytacera alleges.  ( Id. at 9)  There is no evidence Judge Burke \n\u00a0\n3\u00a0Moreover, this, too, is a new argument and waived. \u00a0Case 1:20-cv-00333-LPS-CJB   Document 155   Filed 05/09/22   Page 5 of 9 PageID #: 22606 \n relied on CytomX\u2019s accused techno logy in construing the claim terms;  indeed, the record reflects \nhis understanding that CytomX\u2019s technology \u201chas  no relevance to the claim construction \nprocess.\u201d  (D.I. 136 at 12; see also D.I. 145 at 9 n.4) \n 8. Vytacera also objects to the recomm ended construction of \u201cinhibitor is \nadministered alone or together with said anti body\u201d as meaning \u201cinhib itor is administered by \nitself, i.e., not with said anti body, or inhibitor is co-administere d with said antibody.\u201d  (D.I. 141 \nat 9-10)  Vytacera points to the Report\u2019s reference to this dispute as an \u201co ffshoot\u201d of the dispute \nover the \u201cinhibitor\u201d term, arguing the Court should  reject the Report\u2019s cons truction of this term \nfor the same reasons as discussed in  connection with the first term.  ( Id. at 9)  Accepting \nPlaintiff\u2019s own logic, the Court rejects Plaintiff\u2019s arguments, fo r all of the reasons discussed \nabove in connection with the \u201cinhibitor\u201d term.  Moreover, the Court agre es with Judge Burke\u2019s \nanalysis as to the administration of the inhib itor and the BAA, which Vy tacera does not directly \nchallenge despite it be ing central to Judge Burke\u2019s construction.4  (See D.I. 130 at 10-11)  \n9. The Court now turns to Defendant\u2019s Objections.  CytomX objects to the \nrecommended construction of \u201crecognition domain\u201d (\u201cRD\u201d) as meaning \u201ctargeting moiety, i.e. a \nmolecule that binds to a defi ned population of cells.\u201d  ( See D.I. 151 at 6-10)  As to this term, the \nparties\u2019 sole dispute is whether the RD recited in certain depende nt claims must be a \u201cdistinct \n\u00a0\n4 Vytacera\u2019s Objections focus on the Report\u2019s cons truction of the two terms already discussed.  \nVytacera adds in a footnote that \u201cthe aforementi oned arguments overlap and are applicable to all \nMarkman  terms,\u201d so the Court should reject the Report\u2019s constructions of two other terms as \nwell.  (D.I. 141 at 9 n.3)  Vytacera has offered no se parate analysis as to these other two terms.  \nThis footnote \u2013 which CytomX describes as a \u201cthrow-away effort to impugn the otherwise \nuncontested recommended constructi ons\u201d (D.I. 145 at 10 n.6) \u2013 is fa r from adequate to obtain the \nrelief sought.  Moreover, if Vytacera is correc t that the terms all overl ap, then the Court would \nreach the same conclusion (i.e., agre e with the Report) with respect to  all of the terms.  Hence, to \nbe clear, the Court adopts th e Report\u2019s recommended construc tions of \u201creduction of binding \nactivity of said inhibitor\u201d and \u201cbiologically active agent.\u201d Case 1:20-cv-00333-LPS-CJB   Document 155   Filed 05/09/22   Page 6 of 9 PageID #: 22617 \n molecular component\u201d from the BAA and the inhibitor.  ( See id.  at 1)  As the Report explains, \nboth parties agree a RD can be part  of the same molecule as either  a BAA or an inhibitor.  (D.I. \n149 \u00b6 3)  CytomX, however, seeks a construction that  would require that th e RD must also be a \n\u201cdistinct molecular component\u201d from the BAA and the inhibitor.  The Court agrees with the \nReport that CytomX has failed to justify the narr ow construction it seeks,  for reasons including \nits failure to provide persuasi ve support for the concept of \u201cintra-molecule distinctness\u201d it \nproposes.  ( See id.  \u00b6 4) \n10. CytomX lodges three primary complaints  with the Report\u2019s reasoning as to this \nterm.  First, it argues the Report made an er ror of law by \u201cstart[ing] with an apparent \npresumption that two or more cl aim elements can be indistinct.\u201d   (D.I. 151 at 6)  The Court \ndisagrees.  Judge Burke simply observed th at, although the RD has a different name than \n\u201cinhibitor\u201d and \u201cBAA,\u201d and although the patents indicate it has a distinct function, this does not \ncompel a conclusion that it must  always be a \u201cdistinct molecu lar component\u201d from those other \ncomponents.  ( See D.I. 149 \u00b6 4)  The Report does not rely  on any presumption of indistinctness; \nrather, it acknowledges certain distinctions betw een the RD and other claim elements, but finds \nthe particular distinction advocated by Cy tomX unsupported and somewhat confusing.  ( See id. ) \n(noting \u201c[t]his concept of \u2018intra -molecule distinctness\u2019 does not a ppear to be discussed in the \npatents-in-suit in any clear , direct way\u201d and it is unclear \u201cwha t it actually means to be a \u2018distinct \nmolecular component\u2019\u201d) \n11. Second, CytomX contends that the Repor t\u2019s recommended constr uction is at odds \nwith the claims and specification, which pur portedly support CytomX\u2019s  argument that the \ninhibitor, BAA, and RD are \u201cdis tinct molecular components.\u201d  ( See D.I. 151 at 7-9)  As the \nCourt already explained, however , the claims\u2019 use of different language for and assignment of Case 1:20-cv-00333-LPS-CJB   Document 155   Filed 05/09/22   Page 7 of 9 PageID #: 22628 \n different functions to the three claim elements do es not compel the constr uction CytomX seeks.  \nNor does the specification.  CytomX points to preferred embodiments describing the RD as \nhaving a discrete function from the BAA or inhibi tor or as having an \u201cassociation\u201d with those \nother elements ( see id. at 7-8), but the Court agrees with Vytacera that these examples do not \nforeclose the possibility that thos e elements could be indistinct ( see D.I. 154 at 7).  Moreover, as \nVytacera notes, the record lacks any explicit disc laimer of an embodiment in which the RD and \nBAA are indistinct.  ( See id. at 3)5   \n12. Third, CytomX asserts that its proposed construction is consistent with Judge \nBurke\u2019s other recommended constructions (and that Vytacera \u2019s is not).  ( See D.I. 151 at 9-10)  \nFor example, referencing dependent claim 16 of the \u2019913 patent, CytomX argues Vytacera\u2019s \nconstruction would allow \u201cthe BAA (in the guise of  a \u2018recognition domain\u2019) to be attached to the \ninhibitor,\u201d which would \u201cplain ly violate[] the recommended \u2018i nhibitor constr uction.\u2019\u201d  ( Id. at 10)  \nBut the Court agrees with the Report that this example does not \u201cnecessarily mean[] that a RD \ncould never, under any circumstance, be seen as  indistinguishable mol ecularly from a BAA.\u201d  \n(D.I. 149 \u00b6 5)  As the Report concludes, Cyto mX has not justified im porting its particular \nconception of distinctness into the specification\u2019s express defini tion of RD, which the Report\u2019s \nrecommended construction reflects.  ( See id.  \u00b6 1) (\u201cThe recommended construction . . . comes \nfrom an explicit definition of the RD term in  the patents.\u201d) (citing \u2019504 patent at 6:5-7) \n  \n\u00a0\n5 The Court finds it unnecessary, given its other conclusions, to consider  Plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s \ndeclaration, or Defendant\u2019s co ntention that it was untimely.  The Report likewise found it \nunnecessary to do so.  Case 1:20-cv-00333-LPS-CJB   Document 155   Filed 05/09/22   Page 8 of 9 PageID #: 22639 \n  13. Given the detailed reasoning provided in the Reports, it is unnecessary to address \nthe parties\u2019 Objections any further.  \n                   ________________________________ May 9, 2022      HONORABLE LEONARD P.
