Del. Aug. 21, 2018).   Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 1 of 11 PageID #: 17722 \n  The Court\u2019s Report and Recommendation is consistent with the bench ruling announced \nat the hearing on July 8, 2022,1 pertinent excerpts of which follow:  \nThe final case t oday [is] Diogenes Limited [&] Colossus Limited \n[vs.] DraftKings, Inc .  At issue there is Defendant \u2019s Rule 12(b)(6)  \nmotion, which seeks to dismiss the claims in  the [A]mended \n[C]omplaint as to all eight asserted  patents, pursuant to Section \n101. \n In an effort to convince the Court to dismiss the [A]mended \n[C]omplaint as to all 31  asserted claims across all eight patents,  \nDefendant asserts that asserted claim 1 of  United States Patent \nNumber 8,721,439, or the  '439 patent, is representative of all of the  \nother asserted claims in all of the other  asserted patents.  The '439 \npatent is entitled  \u201cWagering Apparatus, Methods, and Systems.\u201d  \nClaim 1 of the patent is lengthy.  It is a  claim [to a] method of \nconducting a multi -outcome  wagering event for one or more  \nplayers, where  the wagering event comprises a defined number  \nof what are called \u201c legs,\u201d and where at least  one player is \npresented with at least what the  claim calls a \u201cbuy-out offer \u201d or a \n\u201cpartial  buy- out offer \u201d prior to completion of all [of] the  legs.  The \npatent explains in column 4 that a  leg can be any number of \nindividual components  of any type of event, such as an inning of a  \nbaseball game or a baseball [game] itself or a  combination of \nbaseball games, lik e the games  in the World Series. \n In a bit, I [ will] discuss Defendant \u2019s effort  to attempt to obtain \ndismissal of all of the  asserted claims across all of the asserted  \npatents in this case by simply focusing on this  one purportedly \nrepresentative claim.  But to  start, I [ will] go through the Alice  \nanalysis as to  claim 1 of the '439 patent, which I [ will] simply  refer \nto as claim 1.  The Court will do so in order to determine, at least as to that one  claim, if Defendant has made its case for  dismissal.  \n I now turn to the Alice  analysis at step  o[n]e.  Here, Defendant \nargues that claim 1 is  directed to the abstract idea of \u201c hedging  \nfinancial risk. \u201d  There \u2019s no question that  \u201chedging financial risk\u201d  is \nan abstract idea,  and Plaintiffs do not assert otherwise.  In Bilski \n[vs.] Kappos , for example, the Supreme  Court explained that the \nconcept of hedging financial risk is an \u201c unpatentable abstract  \n \n1  (See D.I. 45)  \n Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 2 of 11 PageID #: 17733 \n idea\u201d and to allow a patentee to \u201c patent risk  hedging [] would pre [-\n]empt use of this approach in all fields, and would effectively grant \na monopoly over an abstract idea. \u201d2 \n \nThus, the next step of the analysis is to ask whether it  [is] correct \nthat claim 1 really is  directed to the abstract idea of \u201c hedging  \nfinancial risk. \u201d  Here, in asserting that it is, Defendant starts by \npointing to the claim  itself.  Although the claim has eight different  \nsteps to it, Defendant asserts [\u2014]the Court  believes rightly [\u2014]that \nmost of those steps are \u201c generic steps. \u201d  [Defendant]  notes, for \nexample, that  the claim uses functional language to describe how it \nmakes use of certain computer equipment  to first initiate a \nwagering event, then to receive a wager, then to identify one or more  winners, then to initiate at least one of a  buy-out offer or \npartial buy- out offer, then to receive acceptance of that offer, then \nto complete the remainder of the wagering event,  [and] then to \ndetermine if any of the players have won the event.  And Defend ant points to the  preamble and to the fifth step of the claim,  \nwhich note that at least one of the player [s] has  to be presented \nwith at least one of a buy -out offer or a part [i]al buy -out offer prior \nto the  completion of the event.  Defendant says those  buy- out \noffers are a key part of the claim and  it says that t hose are basically \njust a way of  hedging financial risk.  Lastly, Defendant asserts that \nall of  these generic steps are basically just steps  that can be and \nhave been taken in a  brick -and-mortar casino context.  The claim,  \naccording to D efendant, simply amounts to computerizing those \nconcepts.  In the end, then, Defendant argues that the claim is  \ndirected to the well -known concept of hedging risk, whi ch the \nclaim happens to do by using a  computer.  \n This brings up a few questions.  For one, is initiating or receiving acceptance of a \u201cbuy-out\u201d or \u201cpart[i]al buy- out\u201d offer just  another \nway of offering someone the ability to hedge risk on a bet?  In the \nCourt \u2019s view, the  answer is yes.  The patent specification says  that \na buy- out or \u201c cash out \u201d[\u2014]the parties  tend to use the terms \ninterchangeably[ \u2014]are the same thing.  And in column 2, the \npatent  notes that \u201c the game operator [(]or any other  entity [)] may \noffer the player a fractional amount  of the potential [J]ackpot  \n[P]ool to buy the ticket  for the still pending games and thereby \nprovide  the player the opportunity to cash in and avoid the risk  of \nbeing eliminated on a later leg or  the final event. \u201d\n3  In other words, \na player  would accept the buy- out offer as a way of  avoiding the \nrisk of losing his bet.  He \u2019d be hedging his bet.  \n \n2   Bilski v. Kappos , 561 U.S. 593, 611- 12 (2010).  \n \n3  ('439 patent , col. 2:48- 53 (emphasis added) ) Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 3 of 11 PageID #: 17744 \n  \nIndeed, today, Plaintiff [s] did [ not] seriously contest the not ion that \na buy- out offer is a means of hedging financial  risk.  That has to be \ntrue. \n \nNext, is this part of the claim[ \u2014]the part  relating to the buy- out \noffer [\u2014]what the claim  is really directed to?  Again, the Court  \nconcludes that the answer is yes.  As Defendant  notes, the fact that \nthe method includes the  ability of one or more players to accept a  \nbuy-out offer or part [i]al buy- out offer is a  prominent part of the \nclaim \u2019s preamble.4  Column  2 of the patent underscores that this \nreally is  the key to the claim.  There, the patent  explains that a \n\u201cunique differentiator  of the  product of the present disclosure may \nbe that  at any desired time after the initiation of an  event  . . . any \ndesired number of players who remain  eligible for a prize . . . or to \nwin or have correct  [(]win[)] predictions for each of the events or \nlegs that are completed, may be offered a [\u2018]buy-out[\u2019] or an \nopportunity to sell their tickets  . . . to the  game operator \u201d or \nothers.5  That [this] is the key  aspect of the claim is further \nunderscored by Plaintiff [s\u2019] allegation in paragraph 12 of the  \n[A]mended [C]omplaint, where Plaintiffs allege that \u201c the specific \ninventive feature claimed in each  one of the [ a]sserted [ p]atents is \nthe ability to  pres ent multiple players with a \u2018 buy-out\u2019 option \nbefore the completion of the final  wagered -upon event.\u201d6 \n \nIn light of these portions of the record, and particularly what the patent tells us, the  Court agrees with Defendant that claim 1 is  \ndirected to the abstract idea of hedging  financial risk.  \n Now, in pushing back and arguing the  claim is not in fact directed \nto an abstract  idea at step one, Plaintiff [s] make [] a few  different \narguments, which the Court will now  address in turn.  None are \navailing. \n \nFor example, in [their] briefing, Plaintiff [s] assert [] that the claims \nare directed to a method that is \u201c rooted in computer networking \nand specifically online gaming technology\u201d  or that the claims \n\u201cfocus on unique technical  functionality [.]\u201d\n7  Yet the id ea that \n \n4  (D.I. 17 at 8)  \n \n5  ('439 patent , col. 2:32- 44 (emphasis added) ) \n \n6  (D.I. 14 at \u00b6 12 (emphasis added))  \n \n7  (D.I. 20 at 7- 8 (internal quotation marks, emphasis and citations omitted) ) Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 4 of 11 PageID #: 17755 \n claim 1 is  directed to or \u201c rooted in\u201d  any particular  computer \ntechnology is simply not correct.  To  be sure, claim 1 does include \nutilization of  certain computer -based hardware.  The claim  \nexplains, for example, that one or more  \u201cwagering input devices \u201d \ncommunicate with a  \u201csystem controller \u201d through which the player \nor players participate in the wagering event [,] and  that the system \ncontroller is adapted to allow  for the method in the claim.8  But the \npatent  makes clear in column 4, lines 6 to 10, that a  \u201csystem \ncontroller \u201d is simply any hardware  device or devices that include a \nprocessing device and associated memory.  And in column 4, lines \n1 to 6, the patent tells us that a  \u201cwagering input device \u201d can be a \nwagering  station, a wagering te rminal, an  internet -connected \ncomputing system, smart  phones, tablet computers, televisions, or \nany other similar devices.  There[ is] nothing about  claim 1 or the \npatent that suggests that any particular  technology, any particular  \ntype of  hardware, or any particular  type of software  process is \nwhat this claim is about.  Instead, the Court agrees with Defendant that claim 1  \u201c[is] not \u2018 rooted \u2019 in technology; [ it] simply use [s] \ngeneric computer components to implement the  abstract idea of \nhedging [financial] risk. \u201d\n9 \n Plaintiffs also asserted that the claims  are not directed to the \nabstract idea at issue  because they \u201c have the capability to process  \ndata from multiple sources in real time  to continuously  generate an \naccurate value for  [each] cash out offer that best represents the  \neffect of instantaneous  odds on the real time  value of a bettor \u2019s \nticket. \u201d\n10  Yet while it may  be that some asserted claims across the \nother  patents include certain of these emph asized  requirements, \nclaim 1 clearly does not.   Indeed, today, Plaintiff [s] acknowledged \nas much.   And as the [United States Court of Appeals for the] \nFederal Circuit made clear in cases  like ChargePoint, Inc. [ vs.] \nSemaConnect, Inc ., \u201cultimately, the [ Section ] 101 inquiry must  \nfocus on the l anguage of the [ a]sserted [ c]laims  themselves [.]\u201d11  \nFor example, claim 1 does not  require the method must generate a \nbuy-out offer in \u201creal time. \u201d  To the contrary, the  buy-out offer or \nthe part [i]al buy -out offer must  simply be initiated \u201c at any time \n \n8  ('439 patent, col. 29:4 -7) \n \n9   (D.I. 27 at 5)  \n \n10   (D.I. 20 at 8 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)  (emphasis added))  \n \n11   ChargePoint, Inc. v. SemaConnect, Inc., 920 F.3d 759, 769 (Fed. Cir. 2019)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 5 of 11 PageID #: 17766 \n before the multi- outcome wagering event has been  completed. \u201d12  \nThe claim, in fact, never uses the words \u201c real time, \u201d like the \nclaims, for  example, in the '779 patent do.  Nor does claim  1 \nrequire t hat data must be processed  \u201ccontinuously\u201d  or that \n\u201cinstantaneous \u201d odds  must be generated.  Again, other claims like  \nthose in the '779 patent might require this, but claim 1 clearly does \nnot. \n \nPlaintiffs next suggest that Defendant \u2019s analogizing of claim 1 to \nthe type of gaming that could occur in the non- computer,  \nbrick -and-mortar world is wrong.  To this end, Plaintiffs asserted \nin the [ir] brief and in the  [A]mended [C]omplaint that \u201c the \ncollection and  processing of this volume of information from a  \nmultitude of sources [,] accurately in real time [,] is not possible \noutside of the technological  environment of an online sports \nwagering system  and cannot be performed by human operators in a  \nbrick -and-mortar casino. \u201d13  The Court will put  aside the reference \nto \u201creal time \u201d collection  and processing for reasons I [ ha]ve \nalready  explained.  With regard to Plaintiff [s\u2019] reference to \ncollecting information from a  \u201cmultitude of sources,\u201d  it[ is] worth \nnoting that  claim 1 requires that only one player  participate in the \nmethod and that only one  wagering event be at issue.  But to the \nextent  that [] [P]laintiffs suggest that the method is  non- abstract \nbecause it c ollects and more  quickly processes a \u201cvolume of \ninformation \u201d that cannot be processed [(]or processed as  quickly[)] \nby a human, that cannot save the claim.  The Court does not understand P laintiffs to  assert, nor could they, that humans are  \nincapable of making a buy- out offer to a bettor  in order to allow \nthe bettor to hedge risk as  part of a mul ti-leg bet.  Thus, to the \nextent  that the claim here is simply [to] using a computer  to \nincrease the \u201c volume of information\u201d  that is  taken into account [in] \nmaking that buy- out offer[,] or to help ensure that the offer is more  \nefficiently made or more accurately made than  one that a human \nmight make, that would, as the  Federal Circuit taught in \nIntellectual Ventures  I LLC [vs.]  Capital One Bank (USA) , amount \nto \u201cmerely adding c omputer fu nctionality to  increase the speed or \nefficiency of the process [,]\u201d which cannot confer patent  eligibility \non an otherwise abstract idea.\n14 \n \n \n12   (\u2018439 patent, col. 29:27- 32)  \n  \n13   (D.I. 20 at 10 ( internal quotation marks, emphasis and citation omitted))  \n \n14  Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 6 of 11 PageID #: 17777 \n So having concluded that Defendant is  correct at step one, the \nCourt now moves on to step two. \n \nAgain, step two of the Alice framework  requires a Court to assess \nwhat else there is  in the claim beyond the abstract idea to \ndetermine whether the additional elements  transform the nature of \nthe claim into a  patent -eligible application of the abstract  idea. \nPlaintiff [s\u2019] step two arguments regarding claim 1 fare no better \nthan their step one  arguments. \n At step two, Plaintiffs cite to their  [A]mended [C] omplaint for the \nproposition that  permitting bettors to accept a buy -out offer  was \nhelpful to the online  gaming industry specifically and that it solved \nproblems in that industry.  For example, Plaintiffs allege  that by \npermitting this option, first, player  confidence improves; second, \nmore bettors who were offered buy -outs would re -wager all or  \nsome of those earnings; third, bettors were  thus more engaged in \ntheir betting experience;  and, fourth, that they thus continue \ngaming online longer than they might have and increased their loyalty to online platforms;  which, [fifth], benefitted the online \ngaming industry by increasing wagering site  \u201c\u2018stickablity .\u2019\u201d\n15  Of \ncourse, none of these  things, including the concept of \n[\u201c]stickablity, [\u201d] are claimed in claim 1.  Plaintiffs are simply   \narguing that the use of claim 1 helped to generate these benefits in the o nline gaming wor [ld].  In making this argument in their briefs,  \n[] [P]laintiffs analogize this case to that of  DDR Holdings, LLC [ \nvs.] Hotels.com, L.P .,\n16 which Plaintiffs say is the most \ncomparable case to our facts.  \n To the contrary, however, the Court  agrees with Defendant that not \nonly does DDR  Holdings  not support Plaintiffs \u2019 case, it helps  make \nDefendant \u2019s argument for it as to why claim 1 is ineligible.  In \nDDR Holdings , the representative claim addressed by the Court  \nrecited a system that, among other things [ (1)] stored \u201c visually \nperceptible elements \u201d corresponding to numerous host websites in \na database, which each of those host websites  displayed at least \none link associated with a  product or service of a third- party \nmerchant;  [(2)] on activation of the link by a website  visitor, \nautomatically identifies the host; and, [(3)] instructed an [I] nternet \nweb server  of an \u201coutsource provider \u201d to construct and serve to the \nvisitor a new, hybrid web page  that merged content associate[d] \nwith the  third -party merchant \u2019s products with the stored visually -\n \n15   (D.I. 20 at 13- 14) \n \n16   DDR Holdings, LLC v.

Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 7 of 11 PageID #: 17788 \n perceptible elements from the host  website.17  It is true that the \nFederal Circuit  noted, in explaining why the claim was not  \ndirected to an abstract idea, that the claim  solved a problem t hat \nspecifically arose in the  realm of computers and the [I] nternet. \nThat is [:]  the problem of retaining website visitors that  otherwise \nhave been transported away from the  host \u2019s website when they \nclicked on an  advertisement and activated a hyperlink.  B ut what \nwas key to the DDR Holdings  Court \u2019s Alice  decision was that the \nclaim was  not directed to an abstract idea because the claimed \nsolution was \u201c rooted in computer  technology  in order to overcome \na problem  specifically arising in the realm of computer  \nnetworks.\u201d18  That is, the claim specified how  \u201cinteractions with \nthe internet are manipulated  to yield a desired result [\u2014]a result \nthat overrides the routine and conventional sequence  of events  \nordinarily trigged by the click of a  hyperlink.\u201d19  This was the fact \nthat the claim created a new composite web [page ] that combined \nthe look of the host website with the product  information of the \nmerchant.  \n \nHere, in contrast, even if it [ is] so[\u2014]and the Court assumes it [ is] \nso[\u2014]that claim 1  provides certain benefits to entities in the  online \ngaming industry that might not be  relevant or applicable in the \nhuman world, the  reason why claim 1 fails the Alice  test is that it is \ndirected to the abstract idea of risk  hedging itself, and in that [in ] \ncomputeriz[ing]  risk hedging, or performing risk hedging in the  \nonline context, the claim does not in any way improve how \ncomputers function or  [] override  the routine or conventional ways \nthat computers  can be used [,] so as to provide an inventive  concept \nsufficiently distinct from the abstract idea itself.  As Defendant \nnotes, \u201c a new  electronic or software technique specific to  the \nabstract concept of \u2018cash out \u2019 or \u2018buy out \u2019 of a bet is not \nclaimed. \u201d20  Instead, claim  1 simply takes an abstract idea and does \nit on a  computer, and in doing so, the computer could help process \ninformation for the hedging process faster or more accurately or in a more complex form than a human might.  Lastly, on pages 17 through 19 of thei r answering brief, Plaintiffs \nsuggest the patents  disclose an inventive concept at step two \n \n17   Id. at 1249- 50.   \n \n18   Id. at 1257 (emphasis added) . \n \n19  Id. at 1258 (emphasis added).  \n \n  20   (D.I. 17 at 18)    Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 8 of 11 PageID #: 17799 \n because they disclose a \u201cnonroutine and nonconventional series of \ntechnical steps [,]\u201d in that they \u201c offer continuous  cash -in ability as  \nsoon as it is technically possible \u201d or because  the generation and \ncommunication of buy- back or  partial buy- back offers \u201coccurs in \nreal time \u201d or because the [ claims]  provide a \u201cspecific  mid-tier \nserver architecture\u201d  that permits all of this  to occur.21  For reasons \nthe C ourt has already expressed, the Court does not see how these  \nlimitations are part of what is claimed in  claim 1, so it does not see \nhow they can save  the claim at step two.  \n \nFor all the reasons set out above, the  Court recommends that the \nDistrict Court find  that claim 1 of the '439 patent [is] ineligible for \npatenting.  The Court has also reviewed the four  other currently asserted \nclaims of the patent [:]  claims 20 to 22 and claim 26.  Claim 26 is  \nmerely the system analogue to claim 1 \u2019s method claim, with the \nlimitations of those two claims  essentially mirroring each other. \nClaim 20  adds only that this wager comprises a list that  is at least \none of printed on a ticket, printed on a voucher, and displayed via one or more of  the wagering input devices.  Claim 21 simply  notes \nthat the one or more wagering input  devices comprises one of a \nnumber of possible  such devices.  And claim 22 adds only that the  \nwagering event comprises a fixed, variable, or  guaranteed pool or \nis progressive.  The Court  cannot see how any of these claims add \nanything that would alter its decision as to  eligibility.  These other \nfour claims are cabined in number and they are in the same  patent \nthat was the focus of the represen tative  claim discussion herein and \nin the briefing.  And thus [,] the Court also recommends that  the \nDistrict Court find these claims ineligible  and that it therefore grant \nDefendant \u2019s motion  as to each of the asserted claims related to  \nthe '439 patent.  \n Howev er, as I noted earlier, Defendant  also wishes its motion to be \ngranted as to all  other asserted claims of all seven other  asserted \npatents.  The Court recommends that  the motion be denied in that \nrespect, without  prejudice to renew at a later stage of the case[,] \nbecause Defendant has not sufficiently  demonstrated that claim 1 \nis truly  representative of all of those other asserted  claims.  \n To start, I will note that I  [have] been  reviewing Section 101 \nmotions like these for  most of my entire 11 years as a judge [;] \nduring that time, I have resolved many, many such motions.  But I cannot r ecall ever having seen  an attempt by a defendant to assert  \n \n21   (D.I. 20 at 17- 19 (certain emphasis  added, certain emphasis  omitted))  Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 9 of 11 PageID #: 178010 \n representativeness across such a broad array of  claims and broad \narray of patents in one set of  briefing as in this effort by Defendant \nhere.  \n \nThe [D] efendant \u2019s motion would implicate 27  other asserted \nclaims across the seven other  patents [\u2014]patents that together \ninclude a total  of 376 claims.  And in its briefing, Defendant  \nspecificall y addressed only a very small number  of asserted claims, \nnone with any great  specificity.  Although Defendant asserts that  \nany differen [ce] between claim 1 and those various  claims are \n\u201cminor \u201d and \u201c immaterial, \u201d22 it[ has]  given the Court almost no \nargument or w ay to  meaningfully analyze whether those statements  \nare truly correct.  \n Defendant attached as Exhibit A to its  opening brief a chart that \npurported to show  how certain [\u2014]though nowhere near all [\u2014]of \nthose  asserted claims bo re some relation to claim 1.   But that chart \nwas incredibly hard to read, and it used a color -coded key that was \nvery difficult to decipher.  What was plain was that  Defendant was \nstraining to cram in argument  about a huge smorgasbord of claims \nthat could not responsibly be argued in just one motion like this.  \n It is true that in Berkheimer [vs.] HP  Inc., the Federal Circuit noted \nthat [c] ourts may treat a claim like claim 1 as representative of  \nother claims in certain situations, such as if  the \u201c patentee does not \npresent any meaningful  argument for the distinctive significance of  \nany claim limitation [s] not found in the  representative claim [.]\u201d\n23  \nBut here, in its  answering brief, Plaintiffs did present  meaningful \nargument that one could not use  claim 1 as a cudgel to eliminate 27 \nother  asserted claims across seven other patents in  the absence of \nany real substantive argument in support.  Plaintiffs noted, for \nexample, that  some of those other claims include limitations  that \nclaim 1 does not  . . . such as  \u201creal time buy -out offers \u201d or that \ncontrollers  \u201ccontinuously \u201d retrieve or evaluate data.   Certain of the \nadditional other asserted claims  implicate certain combinations of \nhardware and  software components that did [ not] come up in our  \ndiscussion of claim 1 today.  The Court is not  sure if these types of \nlimitations would  ultimately make a difference in the Section 101  \nanalysis, but they might.  And it believes it[ is] fundamentally \nunfair to Plaintiffs to  invalidate all of these claims without having \na better process before doing so. \n \n \n22  (D.I. 27 at 1)  \n \n23  Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018) . Case 1:21-cv-01695-MN-CJB   Document 46   Filed 07/18/22   Page 10 of 11 PageID #: 178111 \n Of course, it [i s ]not like [] [P]l aintiffs  themselves listed out all 27 \nother of those asserted claims in their answering brief or  provided \npages of detailed argument as to why those claims were all \nmeaningfully different than claim 1.  But who could blame Plaintiffs?   It would be functionally impossible to do that in a 20-\npage brief, and the Court cannot see how Plaintiffs were required to do so here.  In the end, if the District Court adopts the Court \u2019s decision as to  \nthe '439 patent, the Court has little doubt that this will provide  \nsome guidance to [the] parties as to whether other  asserted claims \nof the other asserted patents really are meaningfully different than the '43[9] patent \u2019s asserted clai ms.  That may in turn help the \nparties figure out whether those other claims are thus likely to survive any future permitted Section 101 challenge, and in turn, the Court\u2019s decision today might help streamline the case[.]  [B]ut that will have to be enough for now.  Therefore, the Court recommends that  Defendant \u2019s motion be \ngranted [-]in[-]part and  denied [-]in[-]part in the manner set out \nhere.  \n \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.  The parties may serve and file specific written objections \nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may r esult in the \nloss of the right to de novo review in the district court.  See Sincavage v. Barnhart , 171 F.
