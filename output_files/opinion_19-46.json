The jurisdiction of this court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1331 based on the federal securities fraud claim, and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 based on the state \nlaw fraud and breach of contract claims.   The court held a bench trial  in this case from May 9, \n2022, to May 12, 2022. \nThe plaintiffs, APEX Financial Options, LLC , (\u201cAPEX\u201d) and Gopher Financial, LLC , \n(\u201cGopher\u201d) are investment companies  wholly owned by investor Peter Hajas.  The  two companies  \nhave sought damages from the defendants based on a transaction in which Mr. Hajas arranged for \nAPEX and Gopher to purchase the defendants\u2019 equity interests in a sand mining company located in Wisconsin. \nThe company, N orthern  Industrial Sands  (\u201cNIS\u201d) , mines and sells  northern white \u201cfrac \nsand,\u201d which is used in oil drilling operations  that employ the fracking process to extract oil.  2 \n Defendant Ryan Gilbertson was t he founder and chief executive officer of NIS.  The three other \ndefendants are passive investment entities controlled by Mr. Gilbertson and his relatives.   \nDefendant RRG Family Capital LLC  (\u201cRRG\u201d)  is an investment company owned by Ryan \nGilbertson, his father Weldon Gilbertson, and Ryan Gilbertson\u2019s minor son.  Defendant Ryan \nGilbertson Family 2012 Irrevocable T rust (\u201cthe Trust\u201d)  is a trust established by Ryan Gilbertson \nfor his children.  Ryan Gilbertson\u2019s cousin, Chris Johnson, serves as Trust Protector for the T rust, \nand Weldon Gilbertson acts as trustee.  Defendant Total Depth Foundation, Inc., (\u201cthe \nFoundation\u201d) is a charitable foundation.  Weldon Gilbertson serves as president of the Foundation.  \nThe evidence showed that Ryan Gilbertson exercised substantial control over the assets and activities of each of those entities.  \nRyan Gilbertson and the three  other defendants owned interests in NIS, either directly or \nthrough an array of other related entities.  Those related entities included Northern Capital Group, \nLLC; Northern Capital Partners 1, LP; Northern Capital Partners 1, GP, LLC; NIS Investment Holding, LLC; and NI Sand Holding, LLC.   In October 2018, Mr. Gilbertson\n1 and the other three \ndefendants sold their interests in NIS to APEX and Gopher in the following manner:  APEX paid Mr. Gilbertson $275,000 for his equity interest in N orthern Capital Group, LLC .  APEX paid the  \nTrust $10 for its equity interest in Northern Capital Partners 1, GP .  Gopher paid Mr. Gilbertson \n$1,863,354 and RRG $4,136,646 for their respective equity interests in Northern Capital Partners 1, LP .  Gopher paid Mr. Gilbertson and the Trust $1,512,574.29 each, and paid the Foundation \n$1,815,089.14 for their respective equity interests in Class B  units of NI Sand Holdings LLC , \nwhich were preferred shares having a mandatory redemption date of December 31, 2018.  The \n \n1  As used in this opinion, the name \"Mr. Gilbertson\u201d refers to Ryan Gilbertson.  Weldon \nGilbertson and Brian Gilbertson, Ryan Gilbertson\u2019s cousin who was also the chief operating \nofficer of NIS, are referred to by their full names.  \n3 \n total amount the plaintiffs paid to Mr. Gilbertson and the defendant entities for the ir equity interests \nin NIS and its related entities was $11,115,247.72. \nThe plaintiffs \u2019 breach of contract claim stems from Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s  alleged breach of  \ncertain warranties and required disclosures set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement (\u201cEPA\u201d), \nwhich was the instrument through which the defendants\u2019 equity interests in NIS were transferred \nto the plaintiffs.  The  plaintiffs \u2019 fraud claims \u2014both the federal securities fraud claim  and the state \nlaw fraud claim \u2014are based on the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Mr. Gilbertson knowingly provided \nfalse and misleading information regarding the value of NIS, principally by overstating the value \nof the company\u2019s inventory at the time of the sa le by approximately $7 million and failing to \ndisclose six contracts that imposed ongoing financial obligations that could burden the company \nafter the sale.   Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s actions, the plaintiffs al lege, had  the effect  of overstating NIS\u2019s \nvalue  at the time of the sale .  As a consequence, the plaintiffs contend, Mr. Hajas purchased a  \ncompany that he would not otherwise have purchased, and he suffered a loss of the full value of \nhis investment .  The plaintiffs seek an award of damages in the amoun t of the purchase price of \n$11,115,247.72 for the defendants\u2019 equity interests in NIS .   \nThe defendants respond that they did not misrepresent the value of the company and that \nMr. Hajas and his associates were given full access to NIS\u2019s books and records, from which they \ncould, and did, form their own assessment of the company\u2019s value  prior to the equity sale .  Both \nparties seek an award of attorney \u2019s fees based on the fee- shifting  provision that was included in \nthe EPA.   4 \n A.  Factual Background  \nMr. Hajas has  known Ryan Gilbertson since 2000, when Mr. Gilbertson began working for \nan investment services company co- owned by Mr. Hajas.  After Mr. Gilbertson left that firm, he \nand Mr. Hajas remained friendly and were in regular contact as  social and business acquaintances.  \nIn 2014, Mr. Gilbertson founded NIS  to meet the demands of the oil production industry \nfor northern white frac sand, which can be found in abundance in sub -surface deposits in certain \nareas of Wisconsin.   Mr. Gilbertson served as the president and chief executive officer of NIS  until \nthe closing of the EPA . \nNIS\u2019s sand mine was located on an 800- acre property near Chetek, Wisconsin.  The site \ncontained several facilities where distinct tasks necessary to producing the frac sand were \nperformed.  First, land at the mine site was stripped to allow the sand to be extracted, after which \nthe sand was removed from below the surface.  Next, the sand was  crushed, screened, and \nprocessed to remove impurities, a process that took plac e at a \u201cwet plant .\u201d  The sand w as then \ntransported to a  \u201cdry plant,\u201d where it was dried, sorted, and prepared for transport.  At the NIS \nfacility, the dry plant was  located about 10 miles from the wet plant, and the sand had to be trucked \nfrom the wet plan t to the dry plant  for processing.  The sand was then loaded onto rail cars at a rail \nyard adjacent to the dry plant.  The finished product  would then be shipped by rail to a transload \nfacility, where it w ould be loaded onto trucks for delivery to the cust omer at the drilling site . \nIn 2014, Mr. Hajas shared office space with Mr. Gilbertson and other officers of NIS .  \nDuring that year, Mr. Hajas invested $4 million in NIS .  He later invested another $400,000 in the \ncompany.  From that time on, Mr . Hajas served as a member of  an informal advisory group \nconsisting of several of the investors in NIS.  In that capacity, Mr. Hajas  provided Mr. Gilbertson \nwith financial advice relatin g to NIS\u2019s affairs.  5 \n In June 2018, Mr. Gilbertson was convicted of securities fraud, conspiracy, and wire fraud \nin an unrelated matter.   During the same period, NIS was seeking to obtain additional working \ncapital by refinancing its debt with the investment  bank Dougherty Funding LLC  (\u201cDougherty\u201d) .  \nAs a condition of the refinancing, Dougherty insisted that Mr. Gilbertson not be involved in the \nmanagement of NIS  going forward, and that he retain  no more than a four percent equity interest \nin the company.   \nMr. Hajas was  also concerned that Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s conviction might adversely affect NIS .  \nMr. Hajas therefore decided that steps should be taken to remove Mr. Gilbertson from his position \nof control over the company.  At the same time, Mr.  Gilbertson was i nterested in generating cash \nto cover what he expected would be sizable  monetary penalties assessed against him as a result of \nhis criminal conviction.  \nOn July 9, 2018, Mr. Hajas and another NIS investor met with Brian Gilbertson (Ryan \nGilbertson\u2019s cousin and the chief operating office r of NIS ) and Steve Swanson  (a member of the \nNIS management team ).  Mr. Hajas told them it was very likely that Ryan Gilbertson would be \ngone from the company after the re -financing was completed.  Although Ryan Gilbertson was \ninitially resistant to being forced out of the company, Mr. Hajas did not believe Mr. Gilbertson was important to the  success of the company .  Instead, he stated that his \u201c money is on Brian \n[Gilbertson ].\u201d  Tr. 153:24\u2013154:18. \nOn August 10, 2018, Ryan Gilbertson asked Mr. Hajas if they could meet to \u201ctalk about \nNIS.\u201d  Tr. 161:11\u201314.\n2  At their meeting three days later, Ry an Gilbertson explained that he w as \nlikely to face significant financial penalties at the sentencing proceeding in his criminal case and \n \n2  As used in this opinion, citations to \u201cTr.\u201d refer to the offic ial transcript of the bench trial \nin this case, which can be found at Dkt. No. 271.  \n6 \n that he needed to raise cash to prevent the government from seizing some of his irreplaceable \nassets , including his hom e.  Mr. Gilbertson inquired whether Mr. Hajas would be interested in \npurchasing the interest s in NIS  that he owned personally and through RRG .  After the meeting, \nMr. Gilbertson provided Mr. Hajas with a spreadsheet reflecting the value of the company as \ndetermined under two different methods of valuation, including the \u201c EBITDA multiple\u201d \nmethodology.3  Mr. Hajas expressed interest in purchasing Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s equity interest s in NIS  \nand began negotiating with Mr. Gilbertson on the price.  Meanwhile, Mr. Hajas and his \u201cright-hand man,\u201d Shane Dore, began conducting a due diligence study of the company and the drilling \nsand market to make their own determination as to the company\u2019s valu e.\n4 \nMr. Gilbertson\u2019s spreadsheet calculated the value of Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s share of the company \nat $9,098,589, which was close to Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s basis in the investment.  PX088-1.  Mr. Hajas \nused the same valuation methodology, but  with somewhat differen t inputs.  Based on his inputs, \nMr. Hajas derived a value of $6,493,905 for Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s equity interest in the company.5  \nDX183 .  Mr. Hajas\u2019s calculation was based  in part  on an $8.7 million valuation of the inventory \nof sand owned by the company.  Id.   \nIn early September  2018, after conducting significant due diligence directed to determining \nthe value of NIS, Mr. Hajas offered $6.5 million for Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s equity interest in the \n \n3  EBITDA is a well -known financial  reporting metric .  The acronym stands for \u201cearnings \nbefore interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.\u201d  \n4  The evidence at trial established that Mr. Dore served as  APEX\u2019s chief financial officer  \nand as  an agent of Gopher.  He represented Mr. Hajas and the plaintiffs throughout the course of \nthe NIS equity sale.   See, e.g., Tr. 108:24\u2013111:17.  Based on the ev idence regarding Mr. Dore\u2019s \nrole in the transaction, I find that negotiations with and disclosures to Mr. Dore, like negotiations \nwith and disclosures to Mr. Hajas, constituted negotiations with and disclosures to the plaintiffs.  \n5  One major difference b etween the two valuations was  that Mr. Gilbertson \u2019s spreadsheet  \nvalued one of the company\u2019s account s receivable at $1.3 million, while Mr. Hajas\u2019s spreadsheet \nvalued that account receivable at zero.   Compare PX088-1 (cell B35), with  DX183 (cell B35). \n7 \n company.  Shortly before the closing on the equity sale, however, Mr. Hajas lowered his offer to \n$6 million.   Mr. Gilbertson ultimately agreed to that price.  \nIn the course of the due diligence conducted by Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore, NIS employees \nprovided Mr. Ha jas and Mr. Dore with company documents and materials  as they requested  them .  \nAs part of the due diligence investigation, Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore had written correspondence \nand a number of in- person meetings  and phone calls  with Ryan Gilbertson, Brian Gilbertson, Steve \nSwanson, and the c hief f inancial officer  of NIS , Tim Brady. \nThe parties continued negotiating through September  2018 in anticipation of closing the \nsale in early October.  Between September and the ultimate closing in mid -October, an issue arose \nas to the value of the inventory of sand owned by NIS.    \nOn October 1, 2018, Mr.  Brady  sent Mr. Dore a draft of the company\u2019s July and August \nfinancial s.  PX126.  That draft valued the company\u2019s inventory as of August 31, 2018, a t \n$9,015,027.  Id.    \n On October 9, 2018, Mr. Brady sent the final August 2018 financials to Mr. Gilbertson.  \nThose financials listed an inventory value for NIS of $13,437,560 as of August 31, 2018, which \nrepresented an increase of almost $4.5 milli on in inventory from the draft financials for August .  \nPX136- 1.  That evening, Mr. Hajas sent a text message to Mr. Gilbertson inquiring about the \ncompany\u2019s financials for August and September.  PX212.011.  Mr. Gilbertson responded that he \u201cbrought in an outside accounting firm to compile  everything independently\u201d  and that he would \ncheck with the accountants and send the financials to Mr. Hajas shortly.  PX212.012.  Referring \nto Mary Huhn, NIS\u2019s former  in-house accountant who had recently left the company, Mr. \nGilbertson added  that when examining the August financials, \u201cwe found issues with Mary\u2019s \nmeth ods\u2014an inventory driven issue.\u201d  Id.    8 \n Later that evening, Mr. Gilbertson sent an email to Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore with a copy of \nthe version of the company\u2019s A ugust 31 financials that Mr. Brady had sent to Mr. Gilbertson earlier \nthat day.  PX136.  In the email message, Mr. Gilbertson attributed the approximately $4.5 million \ndiscrepancy between th at version and the draft financials to an issue with the accounting methods \nused by Ms. Huhn.  Id.   According to Mr. Gilbertson, using Ms. Huhn\u2019s method of calculating \ninventory had resulted in the inventory values being \u201cchronically understated\u201d on the company\u2019s financial statements.  Id.   Mr. Gilbertson explai ned in that email that \u201c[m]ore accurately,\u201d all \nproduction and freight costs \u201cshould go into the ir respective inventory pool and then be pulled out \nas Tons are invoiced as COGS [cost of goods sold].  In this manner inventor y is based on capital \nspent, not estimates of what is where, then inventory levels can be cross -checked against COGS \nat different points along the way for accuracy as opposed to estimated inventory levels.\u201d  Id. ; see \nalso Tr. 646:19\u2013649:5, 650:14\u2013653:5 (Ryan Gilbertson\u2019s testimony explain ing the decision to \nchange the method of calculating inventory after Ms. Huhn\u2019s retirement).  \nAt around the same time , Mr. Gilbertson emailed  Darren Kray  at Carlson Advisors , NIS\u2019s \noutside account ing firm , and asked Mr. Kray:  \u201c[C]an  you confirm that [the financial statements] \nare solid also as an independent source?  It\u2019s critical that the financials be reliable for the current financing[.]\u201d  DX088.  Mr. Gilbertson testified that he sent that email because he \u201cwanted Darren to go thr ough every single transaction with a fine -tooth comb and make sure everything was . . . \n100 percent accurate, beyond question.\u201d  Tr. 649:14\u201319.  Later that evening, Mr. Kray responded \nto Mr. Gilbertson, stating that Matt Wills (an accountant with Carlson A dvisors ) and Megan \nChristenson (an accounting assistant who worked for NIS) had \u201c reconciled the balance sheet \naccounts and re viewed the expense categories for August.\u201d  DX 088.  He added that \u201c[w]e \ncalculated the cost of goods sold for the eight month period ended August 31 based on our 9 \n discussion yesterday\u2014we can send you the reconciliation of cost of goods sold tomorrow \nmorning.\u201d  Id.  \nOn the morning of October 10, 2018, Mr. Kray sent another email  to Mr. Gilbertson .  That \nemail included the NIS consolidate d balance sheet as of August 31, 2018, which listed the same \n$13,437,560 as the value of the company\u2019s inventory as of August 31.  PX139.  Mr. Kray explained \nthat the cost -of-goods -sold reconciliation \u201cassumes that the sand sold has a cost of $19.02 per ton, \nas we discussed, and accounts for rail costs as calculated by Tim [Brady] based on the tons sold in basin  [i.e., at the railheads near  the drilling site s].\u201d  Id.  Mr. Gilbertson forwarded Mr. Kray\u2019s email \nand the attached financials to Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore later that day.  Id.  \n After receiving the August financials, Mr. Dore contacted Brian Gilbertson and requested \nsupporting information for the increase in the inventory value in the August financials.  In \nresponse, Brian Gilbertson sent Mr. Dore a detailed inventory tracking sheet for the company covering the past two years .  PX143- 1.  In his cover email, Brian Gilbertson promised to try to \nprovide a \u201csnapshot\u201d of  the value of the company\u2019s inventory as of August 31 by the end of the \nday.  PX143.   \nBrian Gilbertson then contacted M s. Christenson and asked her to prove a close estimation \nof the \u201cin -basin and en -route inventory\u201d as of August 31.  PX144.  She responde d by stating that \nthe company\u2019s records showed that as of August 31, a total of 17,250 tons of sand were en route and 43,637 tons of sand were located at railheads in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico, ready to \nbe delivered to customers .  Id.  Brian Gilberts on forwarded those numbers to Mr. Dore and added \nthat \u201cfrom a big picture perspective, we have about $4.5mm in transit or in- basin, $4.5mm in WIP  \n[work in pro cess], [$]600K in finished goods at dry plant, and approx. $4mm in  stripping, mining, \nand crushing costs for a grand total of approx. $13mm in total inventory.\u201d  PX145. 10 \n  At trial, Brian Gilbertson testified that because Mr. Dore\u2019s inquiry \u201cseemed like a pretty \noff-the- cuff request . . . I think I gave him some quick, you know, napkin math.\u201d  Tr. 1403:6 \u201311.  \nAlthough M s. Christenson had sent Brian Gilbertson a copy of the August inventory reconciliation, \nwhich indicated  that there was \u201csupport\u201d for inventory in the amount of $9,917,729.54, PX144- 1, \nBrian Gilbertson testified that he did not recall seeing that document, but instead went \u201cright to\u201d \nthe spreadsheet containing the number of tons of sand en route and in basin, from which he made his rough calculation of $13.5 million as the value of the inventory as of August 31.  Tr. 1404:16\u20131405:7. \nWith respect to the financials for September 30 that Mr. Hajas had requested, Mr. Wills \nsent Mr. Brady an email on October 10 stating that he had \u201c [w]orked through the inventory \nadjustment\u201d for September 30, 2018, \u201cbased upon the [August 31, 2018, ] methodology,\u201d and that \nit appeared to show a $2.58 million increase to inventory.  After the adjustment,\n6 he said, the \ninventory would be approximately $16 million.  PX140.  He asked, \u201cDoes this make sense and seem reasonable?\u201d  Id.   Mr. B rady responded:  \u201cThe amount is a little higher than I expected, \nhowever, we should continue utilizing the methodology in place.  Darren [Kray] \u2014what do you \nthink? \u201d  Id.   Mr. Kray re plied : \u201cI agree we should use the consistent methodology\u2014not sure [if] \nthe $16 million sounds reasonable or not \u2014not sure what volumes there were at the end of \nSeptember.  If production was consistent with prior months and sales were down would make sense that there was an increase [in] inventory volume at  September 30, 2018.\u201d  Id.  He added, \n\u201cMaybe book the entry and see what the financial statements look like.\u201d  Id.     \n \n6  An inventory \u201cadjustment\u201d is an entry made to the company\u2019s accounting records to align \nthe company\u2019s records with the amount of inventory actually in  the company \u2019s possession .  NIS\u2019s \naccounting records we re kept using a software application called QuickBo oks.  \n  \n11 \n On October 12, 2018, Mr. Brady provided Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore with the September \n2018 financials.  PX149.  Those financials listed an inventory value of $16,035,352 as of \nSeptember 30, 2018, which was also the end of the third quarter.  Id.  Brian Gilbertson provided a \nbreakdown of the tonnage underlying that inventory number to the plaintiffs, but did not provide any explanation of how the  $16 million inventory figure was derived.  See PX156.  However, \nmaterials prepared by Matt Wills of Carlson A dvisor s shed light on the manner in which that \nnumber was derived.  See DX212.  It appears from those materials  that the cost of goods sold for \nthe period of January through September 2018 , as shown by NIS\u2019s accounting records, was \n$52,086,754.94, yielding an inventory value of $13,437,559.71, and that the reconciled cost of goods sold as of September 30, 2018  (applying the  method that Mr. Wills dis cusses in PX140) , \nwas $49,500,628.77, which required an upward adjustment to  inventory of $2,586,126.17.  Mr. \nWills\u2019 analysis therefore produced a calculated inventory for September 30, 2018, based on the cost of goods sold, of $16,023,685.88.\n7   \nPrior to  the closing date for the sale, the parties agreed that the plaintiffs would purchase \nnot only Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s personal interest  and RRG\u2019s interest in NIS, but also the interests held \nby the other defendant entities.  The agreement was thus modified to provide for the sale of the other entities\u2019 interests in NIS, including the ir Class B shares of the company. \nThe EPA contained several clauses that imposed war ranties and duties of disclosure on the \ndefendants.  In S ection 2.7 of the agreement, the defendants warranted that the financial statements \nprovided to the plaintiffs prior to the sale \u201cfairly reflect, in all material respects , [NIS\u2019s] financial \n \n7  Mr. Wills\u2019 inventory figure is consistent with the \u201cProduction Inventory\u201d account that \nappears in NIS\u2019s QuickBooks records as of September 30, 2018.  DX217.001.  That number, added \nto the $11,665.80 in the \u201cInventory Asset\u201d account, results in the $16,035,352 inventory figure \nthat appeared in the company\u2019s September 30 financial statements.  See id.; PX159-1.  \n  \n12 \n performan ce as [of] the dates and during the periods presented\u201d and reflected any \u201cmaterial \nobligation\u201d or \u201ccontingent liability.\u201d  PX001 at \u00a7 2.7(a).  In Section 2.8 of the agreement, the \ndefendants warranted that since December 31,  2017, there had not been any \u201cchange or effect \nthat . . . has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d on the \ncompany\u2019s business, condition, assets, or liabilities.  Id. at \u00a7 2.8.  In Section 2.9, the defendants \nwarranted that the company had no liabili ties or obligations except for \u201cliabilities accrued for on \nthe Financial Statements\u201d or \u201cliabilities arising in the ordinary course of business since the date of \nthe Financial Statements that are neither material in amount or effect.\u201d  Id. at \u00a7 2.9.   \nFinally, Section 2.15, the provision of the EPA  that has been a focus of th is litigation , stated \nas follows in pertinent part: \n Contracts .  Schedule 2.15 lists each material contract to which any \nCompany Entity is a party or by which any of their respective assets are bound, \nincluding the Leases (each contract so listed or required to be so listed being a \u201cMajor Contract \u201d).  Seller h as delivered to Pur chaser  a true, correct and complete \ncopy of each Major Contract. \n Id. at \u00a7 2.15.  In Schedule 2.15, the defendants listed ten contracts for Northern Industrial Sands, \nLLC, including road agreements with local Wisconsin governmental entities, a lease agreement \ncovering certain property in Wisconsin, and the set of loan agreements with the Dougherty \ninvestment bank.  PX001.037\u201338.  No other contract s were listed for Northern Industrial Sands, \nLLC.   See id.  \n The sale closed on October 17, 2018.  Following the clos ing, Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore \nembarked on a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into the operations of the company.  Tr. 213:5\u2013215:6, 435:10\u2013436:21; \nPX168.  According to their testimony, they soon discovered a number of contracts that had not been listed in Schedule 2.15 of the EPA , but which imposed continuing obligations on NIS.  Those 13 \n contracts included six undisclosed contracts that form the basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the \ndefendants breached Section 2.15 of the EPA .8  Those  undisclosed contracts are the following: \nChetek Express.  NIS entered into contracts with Chetek Express, a  trucking company, to \nhaul sand between NIS\u2019s Wisconsin sand mine and its wet and dry processing plants , as well as to \nhaul wet sand purchased from Sioux Creek Silica, LLC , (\u201cSiou x Creek\u201d) from the Sioux Creek \nmine to the NIS dry plant.  Chetek Express was owned by Chris Johnson, Ryan Gilbertson\u2019s \ncousin, and Ryan Gilbertson at one point had an ownership interest in the company.  Tr. 57:3\u201325, 535:9\u2013537:4, 675:9\u201322.  The Chetek Expr ess contract  originally  contained a monthly minimum \nhauling provision, which guaranteed that Chetek Express would be engaged to haul at least 30,000 \ntons of sand per month, with a penalty clause of $1.50 per ton for any shortfall .  PX004 at 6.  That \ncontra ct was later amended to increase the monthly minimum to 60,000 tons of sand per month \nbeginning in March 2019.  PX005 at \u00b6 6.  The combination of the mandator y minimum \ncommitments and the penalties for shortfalls could have exposed NIS to penalties of  up to $90,000 \nper month for the duration of the contract, which ran through October 2022.   See id.  The plaintiffs \nacknowledge that they were aware that NIS was using Chetek Express to haul sand, but they assert that they did not know that NIS had a binding contract with Chetek Express containing mandatory \nminimums and shortfall penalties.  \nRJR Trucking, LLC .  In S\n eptember 2018, while the parties were negotiating for the sale of \nthe company, NIS entered into a contract with RJR Trucking, LLC, (\u201cRJR\u201d) .  That contract \n \n8  In their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the plaintiffs also suggest that \nthey were injured by the defendants\u2019 failure to disclose a contract between NIS and Marathon Oil \nCompany (\u201cMarathon\u201d) .  See Dkt. No. 269 at 23.  That allegation was not pursued in detail at trial, \nbut in any event the plaintiffs have not alleged any amount of damages that would be attributable to the non- disclosure of that contract.  See Tr. 1626:6\u20131627:4 (testimony of Dr. Timothy  Nantell , \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 damages expert).  I will therefore not consider the non- disclosure of the Marathon \ncontract as a basis for  determining whether the defendants breached Section 2.15 of the EPA.\n \n14 \n provided that RJR would transload sand from railroad cars and onto trucks that would be used to \ndeliver the sand to NIS\u2019s customers .  The contract committed NIS to engage RJR for certain \nminimum monthly quantities of transloading services, with a 100% penalty for failure to satisfy \nthe monthly minimums .  That provision of the contract left NIS exposed to a minimum monthly \nfee of $60,000 even if RJR was not called upon to trans load any sand.  The plaintiffs introduced \ntestimony  that Ryan Gilbertson told them prior to the closing that the RJR contract was terminating \nin Octo ber 2018 and that there was no need to renew the contract, because NIS could buy \ntransloading services without commitments.  Tr. 72:13\u201374:18.  According to the plaintiffs, Mr. \nGilbertson failed to disclose that  with his approval  NIS had entered into a new agreement with \nRJR,  and that the new agreement  would bind NIS to a monthly minimum commitment through at \nleast September 2019, with the possibility of further renewal.  See PX006 at 1\u20132.  \nSioux Creek Silica.  NIS entered into a contract with Sioux Creek, another sand mining \ncompany with a mine not far from NIS\u2019s Chetek site , in October 2017.  The contract with Sioux \nCreek bound NIS to purchase 250,000 tons of sand from Sioux Creek at $12 per ton.  In April \n2018 NIS entered another agreement to purchase an  additional 250,000 tons of sand at the same \nprice.  Mr. Dore was made aware of the Sioux Creek contract prior to the execution of the EPA , \nbut the plaintiffs contend it was not made clear to Mr. Dore that the contract contained a mandatory minimum purchase requirement at the stated price .  \nContinental Intermodal Group LP \n (\u201cCIG\u201d).   In February 2017, NIS entered into a contract \nwith CIG for transloading services.  The contract required NIS to pay at least $120,000 per month for approximately two years and provided for  a 100% penalty for any shortfall  in the amounts \ntransloaded .  The plaintiffs assert that Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore were not aware of the company\u2019s 15 \n commitment to pay $2.8 millio n to CIG during the pendency of the contract even if CIG \ntransported little or no sand. \nSMBC Rail Services LLC.   In April 2017, NIS entered into a contract with SMBC to lease \nrail cars to be used to transport sand to railheads near the ultimate destination  for the product.  The \nlease agreement imposed costs of about $200,000 on NIS  and included an obligation for NIS to \npay for insurance  on and repairs to the railcars that it leased .  That contract was not disclos ed in \nSchedule 2.15 of the EPA, and Mr. Hajas  and Mr. Dore stated that they were unaware of the extent \nof the commitments in the lease agreement . \nMascoutin Heights Leasing Co.  In early 2017, NIS entered into a contract w ith Mascoutin \nHeights Leasing Co. LLC (\u201cMascoutin  Heights \u201d) to lease rail cars  for a minimum of three years.  \nThat contract exposed NIS to potential costs of more than $400,000 per year.  The contract also \ncontained mileage fees and required NIS to return the cars to a location  designated by Mascoutin \nHeights at the end of the lease.  That contract was not disclosed in Schedule 2.15 of the EPA, and \nMr. Hajas and Mr. Dore testified that they were unaware of the extent of the commitments in the \nlease agreement before closing on the equity sale.  \nAfter taking control of NIS following the sale, Mr. Hajas learned of the six contracts listed \nabove that contained continuing obligations and mandatory minimums.  In addition, following the \nsale Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore reached the conclusion that the value of the company\u2019s inventory that \nhad been quoted to them at the time of the sale was overstated  by approximately $7 million. \nFollowing the plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of the defendants\u2019 equity in NIS, the market for northern \nwhite frac sand collapsed due to decreas ing oil prices, which  led drilling companies to experiment \nwith using local sand that was cheaper to produce  and ship.  Tr. 458:21\u2013460:13, 695:12\u201318.  The 16 \n fortunes of NIS and other frac sand producers in the area sank with the market  collapse, and a \nnumber of Wisconsin sa nd mining companies went into bankruptcy.  NIS is now in receivership.  \nB. The Parties\u2019 Contentions  \nBased principally on the failure to disclose the six specified contracts and on the alleged \noverstatement of the value of NIS\u2019s inventory at the time of the sale, the plaintiffs filed this action \nseeking damages  from the four parties from which they purchased the equity interest s in NIS.  In \ntheir complaint, the  plaintiffs sought recovery of the full purchase price paid for the defendants\u2019 \nequity interest s in the company , together with costs, attorney\u2019s  fees, and punitive damages.  \nIn addition to the undisclosed contracts and allegedly overstated inventory valuation, the \nplaintiffs contend that the defendants overstated the value of the company in several other ways.  \nIn particular, they argue that the defendants booked several accou nts receivable at full value and \ndid not reveal to the plaintiffs that those accounts receivable were unlikely to be recoverable in \nfull.  They also argue that the defendants failed to accrue expected bonus payments to NIS \nemployees  in 2018, which they contend should have been accrued  under appropriate accounting \nprocedures.  With respect to the  accounts receivable, the defendants respond that the plaintiffs \nwere aware of the accounts receivable and were able to place their own valuation on those receivables.  With respect to the bonuses, the defendants responded that the bonuses were not expected and that, as such, they were not required to be accrued for purposes of NIS\u2019s financial statements.   \nAt trial, Mr. Hajas testified that he regarded th e minimum pur chase provisions , fixed lease \nagreements,  and penalty clauses in the six undisclosed contracts as antithetical to what he was \nseeking when he purchased NIS .  He testified that he was interested in a company that was \n\u201cnimble,\u201d i.e., a company that could reduce its expenses during down times without having long-17 \n term commitments that would continue to burden the company even when its sales were low.  Tr. \n56:12\u201320.  Mr. Hajas testified that he was looking for a company that was profitable as is, that he was \u201cno t in the business of fixing up distressed, in- trouble businesses ,\u201d and that because of the \ncontinuing obligations under the six undisclosed contracts, the true state of NIS was precarious, inflexible, and subject to significant risk in a down market.  Tr. 243:8 \u201321.  The contract ual \nobligations  that he learned of after the sale, he testified, left him concerned about the viability of \nthe company.  He testified that if he had he known about those provisions  and the true state of the \ncompany\u2019s inventory as of the closing date, he would not have gone through with the purchase of the defendants\u2019 equity interests in NIS.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs seek recovery of the full amount \nof the payment they made for the equity interest in NIS, or $11,115,247.72. \nIn the alternative, the plaintiffs seek expectation damages on the ground that if the \ndefendants had made full disclosure of the company\u2019s condition, the price would have been \nreduced by $7,617,636.  The  plaintiffs reach that number by relying on the opinion of  their \ndamages expert, Dr. Timothy Nantell, who analyzed the transaction and concluded that if the financial statements were corrected and a conservative 20% discount were made to account for the \nrisks associated with the undisclosed contract s and the accounts receivable, the price for the \npurchased equity would have been $3,497,610, leading to a damages assessment of $7,617,637.  Using an alternative valuation method, he testified that the price should have been $3,963,877, which would result  in damages of $7,151,371.  \nFor their part, the defendants argue  that the inventory values provided to Mr. Hajas and \nMr. Dore shortly before  the closing were not inflated.  They also argue  that the six contracts that \nthe plaintiffs contend should have been disclosed in Schedule 2.15 of the EPA were not material contracts.  In addition, they argue that Mr. Hajas or Mr. Dore were aware of some of those contracts 18 \n and could have inquired about others during the due diligence period, but did not.  The  defendants  \nalso contest the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the re were material misrepresentations or omissions  with \nrespect to those issues and others.  In so doing, the defendants rely heavily on the evidence that \nthe personnel at NIS were cooperative with Mr. Hajas an d Mr. Dore during the due diligence \nperiod and provided them free access to any financial information regarding the company that they \nwished to see.  \nDISCUSSION  \nA. The Breach of Contract Claim  \n1. The \u201cInflated Inventory\u201d Component  \n The first of the two principal component s of the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim is their \ncontention that the defendants breached the warranties in the EPA by inflating the value of NIS\u2019s \ninventory of sand during the period leading up to the equity sale.  In pa rticular, the plaintiffs allege \nthat the financial statements they received from NIS  inaccurately  stated the amount of NIS\u2019s \ninventory on the company\u2019s balance sheet  on several occasions during that period.  That error \nresulted in a corresponding understat ement of the cost of goods sold account on NIS\u2019s income \nstatement .  Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that NIS\u2019s inventory was overstated by $6,983,575 in \nthe third quarter financial statements and th at as a consequence the company\u2019s EBITDA was \noverstated by the same amount.  Shortly after the closing of the e quity purchase, Mr. Dore calculated a \u201cderived inventory\u201d \nfor NIS as of year -end 2018 in connection with NIS\u2019s 2018 audit .  Tr. 889:7 \u201310.  NIS hired a third \nparty to conduct a \u201cdrone survey,\u201d which w as used to determine the volume of sand that was \npresent in various phases of the production process.  Id.  at 870:22\u2013871:6.  Those volumes were \nthen multiplied by the costs associated with each phase of production.  Id. at 888:11\u201317.  The 19 \n derived inventory  value indicated that the book value of the company\u2019s inventory as of December \n31, 2018, was overstated by $2.974 million.  Id.  at 889:25\u2013890:8; DX217 at 7.  As Mr. Dore \nacknowledged at trial, however, that calculation did not indicate what the true inventory value \nwould have been as of September 30, 2018.  Tr. 905:13\u201317.   In his capacity as an expert witness in this case, Mr. Dore attempted to use his \u201cderived \ninventory\u201d approach, i.e., multip lying the number of tons of sand in each phase of production by \nthe costs associated with each phase,  to calculate the true value of NIS\u2019s inventory as of September \n30, 2018.  Mr. Dore began by using his approach to validate the year -end inventory from the  2017 \naudited financial statements.  Id.  at 1445:9\u20131446:6.  His derived inventory approach yielded an \ninventory value that was within one percent of the inventory value that was listed in the audited \n2017 year -end financial statements.  Id.  at 1446:22 \u20131447:1.  Because he was able to replicate the \n2017 year-end inventory amount, Mr. Dore considered his approach to be valid.  He then used his approach to calculate the inventory as of September 30, 2018.  His calculation yielded an inventory \nvalue of $9,051,777, which in his view indicated that the September 2018 financial statements \noverstated the value of NIS\u2019s inventory by $6.98 million, or 77 percent.  Id.  at 1455:7\u201319.  Mr. \nDore testified that he was not able to locate the source of any error in the August  and September \n2018 financials, and that he believed the inventory adjustments made for those two months were  \nsimply  \u201cfictitious.\u201d  Tr. 1511:1\u20131512:12. \n Mr. Dore\u2019s expert testimony regarding the inventory is largely conclusory in nature, and \nthere was no e vidence introduced at trial  that would enable the court to validate his analysis.\n9  See \n \n9  Along with their letter brief submitted after the c losing arguments, the plaintiffs provided \na spreadsheet that purports to validate Mr. Dore\u2019s \u201cderived inventory\u201d analysis.  See Dkt. No. 272-\n1 (rows 8 \u201312).  Th at spreadsheet  was not introduced into evidence  at trial, and the defendants were \nnot able to cross -examine Mr. Dore with respect to the calculations contained in the spreadsheet.  \nIn any event, even if Mr. Dore\u2019s \u201cderived inventory\u201d calculations are correct, the spreadsheet does \n20 \n Tr. 1496:20\u20131499:7 (Mr. Dore failing to identify record evidence that the court could use to \u201ccross -\ncheck\u201d his analysis).  Given th e lack of corroborating evidence and the fact that Mr. Dore is not \nan independent expert, but instead is closely affiliated with the plaintiffs , I find that Mr. Dore\u2019s \ntestimony that the company\u2019s inventory was overstated on the September 2018 financials does not \nprovide compelling support for the plaintiffs\u2019 claim on the inventory issue. \n Through Mr. Dore\u2019s testimony, the plaintiffs mount a challenge to Brian Gilbertson\u2019s \n\u201cnapkin math,\u201d in which Brian Gilbertson used a cost basis to account for the $13 mil lion in \ninventory by combining (1) the cost associated with sand in transit or in basin (i.e., at the destination), which he estimated to be  $4.5 million; (2) the cost associated with work in proc ess, \nwhich he estimated to be  $4.5 million; (3) the cost ass ociated with finished goods at the dry plant, \nwhich he estimated to be $600,000; and (4) the costs associated with stripping, mining, and \ncrushing, which he estimated to be  $4 million.  See PX145.   \nMr. Dore admitted that at the time he first received Brian Gilbertson\u2019s email containing \nthat explanation of the August 31 inventory, the explanation sounded reasonable.  Tr. 928:2\u201318.  At trial, however, Mr. Dore contended that the explanation was not reasonable because, in Mr. Dore\u2019s view, costs associated with stripping, mining, and crushing are properly treated as part of the costs associated with work in proc ess, and thus Brian Gilbertson double -counted the stripping, \nmining, and crushing costs , making it improper for him to count those costs separately as part of \nhis explanation for the approximately $13 million in inventory as of August 31, 2018.  Id. at \n929:25\u2013934:10.  Mr. Dore also contended that he was not aware that Ms. Christenson had sent an \n \nnot address whether, as discussed in more detail below, the methodology employed by Carlson \nAdvisors in calculating the August and September 2018 inventory amounts was improper.  Accordingly, I attribute only minimal weight to th e spreads heet attached to the plaintiffs\u2019 post-\ntrial letter and found at Dkt. No. 272- 1. 21 \n inventory reconciliation document to Brian Gilbertson that  provided support for only $9.9 million \nworth of inventory.10  Tr. 1118:24\u20131120:6. \nIn support of his contention that Brian Gilbertson double -counted the stripping, mining, \nand crushing costs, Mr. Dore cited NIS\u2019s balance sheet for September 30, 2018, which listed \n\u201cprepaid stripping\u201d in a separate account from inventory.  Mr. Dore  testified that stripping \nexpenses are typically booked to the prepaid stripping account, and then re -allocated to inven tory \nas sand is removed from the ground.  Tr. 929:25 \u2013934:10.  He added that \u201cas soon as the sand \ncomes out of ground it becomes WIP,\u201d and it remains WIP \u201cuntil it becomes finished goods, which \nis at the point after it is dried in the process.\u201d   Tr. 939:5\u201312.  Therefore, those costs would already \nhave been included in the WIP component of inventory, so it was improper for Brian  Gilbertson \nto count those costs  again as part of his \u201cnapkin math.\u201d  Tr. 929:25\u2013930:9. \nThere are several problems with the plaintiff s\u2019 reliance on that evidence.  First, the prepaid \nstripping listed on the NIS balance sheet referred to by Mr. Dore was only about $548,000, i.e., only about three percent of the amount listed for inventory, while Brian Gilbertson allocated some \n$4 million to stripping, mining, and crushing, or about one -third of the amount of the inventory \nfor August 31, 2018.  See DX217.001; PX145.  That  difference strongly suggests that t he \u201cprepaid \nstripping\u201d costs did not cover all the costs that fell within Brian Gilbertson\u2019s category of stripping, mining, and crushing.  Second, if Mr. Dore were correct that the $4 million for stripping, mining, \n \n10  As discussed in further detail below, the inventory amounts on the August and \nSeptember 2018 financial statements were the product of a new approach to calculating inventory.  \nRather than basing the inventory on the estimated number of tons of sand in each phase of production, as had historically been done  by Ms. Huhn, Carlson Advisors based its inventory \ncalculations on the costs to produce all of the sand that had been sold year-to-date.  Ms. \nChristenson\u2019s reconciliation document, at PX144- 1, appears to base its calculation on the \nestimated tons in each phase (i.e., the prior approach)  rather than on the year -to-date cost of goods \nsold.\n \n22 \n and crushing w as already included in the WIP costs, that would leave only $500,000 for all the \nother steps in processing the product, which typically entail a much higher percentage of the costs \nthan that.  See PX139- 1 (\u201cStat -COGS\u201d worksheet).   Third, even if Brian Gilbertson used  a different \nconvention than was used by Carlson Advisors or others at NIS in distributing costs into different \nbuckets, that does not mean that he engaged in double counting, or that his total estimate of the inventory valuation was in error.  And finally, it is importan t to note that  Brian Gilbertson does \nnot appear to have been heavily involved in the preparation of the August and September 2018 financial statements.  H e was not included on a number of emails in which Ryan Gilbertson, \nemployees of Carlson Advisors, or t he plaintiffs discussed the financial statements generally or \nthe inventory figures in particular.  See, e.g., PX133; PX136; DX088; IX01; IX18; JX13.  Brian Gilbertson\u2019s \u201cnapkin math\u201d is therefore best viewed as his personal , informal effort to account for \nthe numbers generated on the financial statements, rather than evidence of how the numbers on the financial statements were actually derived.  That is especially true given Mr. Kray\u2019s \nrepresentation that Carlson Advisors itself \u201ccalcu lated the cost of goods sold for the eight month \nperiod ended August 31.\u201d  DX088.\n11 \n Turning to the financial statements , there are reasons to believe that  the $13.5 million and \n$16 million inventory numbers that appeared in the August and September 2018 f inancial \nstatements  were accurate .  First, after receiving the financials from Mr. Brady and before sending \nthem to the plaintiffs, Mr. Gilbertson asked Mr. Kray to confirm that the financials were \u201csolid  . . . as an independent source,\u201d and Mr. Kray respo nded with an explanation of how the \n \n11  Curiously, neither side called Mr. Kray or M r. Wills from Carls on A dvisors , nor did \nthey call M s. Christenson or Ms. Huhn, who worked for NIS, all of whom were involved in the \nevents preceding and surrounding the generation of the inventory estimates for August 31 and \nSeptember 30, 2018. \n23 \n financials were prepared.  DX088.  Second, the company auditors at the accounting firm Olsen \nThielen  reviewed the company\u2019s September 2018 financial statements in connection with the 2018 \nyear-end audit and concluded that \u201c[t]he balances appear reasonable and no additional [audit] \nprocedures [are] considered necessary.\u201d  DX073.  The Olsen Thielen auditors also reviewed the \n2018 general ledger activity, which would include the adjusting entries to inventory for August \nand September of 2018, and they noted \u201cnothing unusual\u201d in that activity.  DX138.  Third, the \nplaintiffs relied upon the third quarter financials that they now assert were inaccurate when they made a presentation to Dougherty in February 2019.\n12  See Dkt. No. 268 at 24 (comparing the \nfinancial statements with the numbers used in the presentation to Dougherty).  Fourth, the plaintiffs never restated the third quarter financials even after they concluded that those financials were \ninaccurate.  Tr. 364:18\u201320 , 827:2\u20135.  And finally, although there is no reconciliation in the record \nsupporting the August inventory adjustment, the defendants introduced evidence supporting the $2.5 million adjustment that was made in September 2018.  See DX212. \n Another reason to question the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the inventory values for August \nand September 2018 were inflated is that  NIS adopted a different method for measuring inventory \nas of August 2018.  As Ryan Gilbertson explained in his October 9, 2018, email to Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore , he concluded that the inventory measurement method used by Ms. Huhn had understated \ninventory.  The new method entailed looking to the cost of goods actually invoiced over the course \nof the year to measure inventory.  The evidence showed that NIS used that method to prepare the \ncompany\u2019s financials for August 31 and September 30, 2018.  See DX212. \n \n12  Mr. Hajas testified that the inventory error , as he perceived it,  was discovered in the \nfourth quarter or 2018 or the first quarter of 2019.  Tr. 486:25\u2013487:6.  \n24 \n  As noted, for the August and September 2018 financials the evidence show ed that the \ndefendants calculated inventory based on the year -to-date cost of goods sold.  I find that the \nnumbers used by the defendants to determine  the cost of goods sold were not \u201cfictitious,\u201d as the \nplaintiffs contend, see Tr. 1506:7, 1512:4, but were the product of the revised method of \ncalculating inventory.   The inventory reconciliation worksheet sent by Mr. Wills to Mr. Brady \nillustrates that, in calculating the cost of goods sold through September 2018, the defendants \nassumed that each ton of  sand sold cost $19.02 to produce  (not counting the freight and transload \nexpenses to deliver the sand  to the drilling sites ).  DX212; see also  PX130 (\u201c[T]his cost of goods \nsold reconciliation assumes that sand sold has a cost of $19.02 per ton, as we disc ussed  . . . .\u201d).  \nThat $19.02 figure was not selected randomly.13  The  June 2018 financial statements i ndicate  that \nthe average cost per ton of sand produced at the dry plant was $19.02.  PX082- 1 (\u201cStat -COGS\u201d \nworksheet), and Mr. Hajas confirmed in his testimony that it cost \u201cabout [$]19 to $20 to put a ton of sand into a railcar,\u201d Tr. 491:4\u20136.  Mr. Wills\u2019 reconciliation worksheet indicates that the actual cost to produce and ship all the sand sold (which would include the $19.02 cost to produce plus freight  costs and other expenses) was compared against the cost -of-goods-sold balance listed in \nQuickBooks, and an adjusting entry (i.e., a \u201cCOGS adjustment\u201d)  was made to reconcile the two.  \nSee DX212.  The corresponding journal entry was made to the inventory account, resulting in the \n \n13  The plaintiffs argue that it does not matter whether Mr. Wills\u2019 reconciliation can be \n\u201creve rse-engineered\u201d if the inventory was nevertheless inaccurate.  Dkt. No. 276 at 2.  I disagree.  \nIf it is possible to  reverse engineer the inventory number that appeared on the September 2018 \nfinancials , the results of that effort may shed  important light o n how that number was derived.  I f \nthere is a basis for the inventory number that appeared in the financial statements, and there are no \napparent errors in the calculation or issues with the underlying calculation methodology, those \nfacts would weigh heavily against the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the inventory was  overstated  or that \nit was \u201cfictitious,\u201d as Mr. Dore asserted at trial . \n25 \n inventory adjustment that the plaintiffs claim was fictitious.  See id.   The plaintiffs have not offered \nany basis to believe that this general approach to calculat ing inventory was improper.  \nIn the letter brief that they filed after closing arguments  in the case, the plaintiffs suggested \nin a footnote that Mr. Wills\u2019 inventory reconciliation was inaccurate because it understated freight \ncosts by approximately $2.9 million and because it did not include brokerage costs of \napproximately $3.45 million.  Dkt. No. 272 at 6 n.6.  Those discrepancies, in the plaintiffs\u2019 view, \naccount for most of the overstatement to inventory that they claim was present  in the September \n2018 financials .  Id.   After reviewing the footnote in the plaintiffs\u2019 letter, I entered an order \nexplaining my tentative analysis and requested that the parties respond.  Dkt. No. 275.  In \nresponding, the plaintiffs argued that my tentative analysis was err oneous  in several respects .  \nAfter carefully considering the plaintiffs\u2019 submissions, I find the ir arguments to be unpersuasive \nand conclude that the discrepancies identified by the plaintiffs are not evidence that Mr. Wills\u2019 \nreconciliation was inaccurate.  \nWith respect to the freight costs, t he plaintiffs are correct that Mr. Wills\u2019 inventory \nreconciliation appears to reflect a lower amount of freight costs than is shown in QuickBooks.  \nDX212.  The apparent discrepancies between Mr. Wills\u2019 freigh t cost numbers and the \ncorresponding numbers in QuickBooks appear to be attributable to the way  NIS recorded expenses \nin QuickBooks.  E xpenses appear to have been  added to the freight expense COGS account in \nQuickBooks on the day they we re incurred; that i s, if NIS incur red a cost to ship a rail car on \nSeptember 30, that expense would be  booked into QuickBooks as of September 30, even if the \ninvoice was paid later and regardless of whe n the sand in that car wa s actually sold.  For that \nreason, the QuickBooks records  for freight costs likely included freight costs that wer e attributable 26 \n to sand that was en route or in basin but had not yet been sold.14  See also PX139 (noting that Mr. \nWills\u2019 inventory reconciliation \u201caccounts for rail costs  . . . based on the tons sold in basin\u201d). \nIt is possible to estimate the freight costs that are attributable to sand that was en  route and \nin basin, and that estimation further supports the inference that the supposedly \u201cmissing\u201d freight \ncosts were actually attributable to sand that had not yet been sold.  The evidence showed that 47,595 tons of sand were in basin and 20,010 tons of sand were en route as of September 30, 2018.  PX156.  Although the record does not appear to show the breakdown of tons between the Jal , New \nMexico,  transload facility and the Oklahoma transload facilities, data from August 2018 indicates \nthat 40.8 percent of the en route and in basin sand was at  or en route to the Jal facility and 59.2 \npercent was at  or en route to the Oklahoma facilities .  See PX144- 1.  A ssuming that those ratios \nremained roughly true in September 2018, one can estimate that the weighte d average cost to ship \n \n14  The plaintiffs argue that in NIS\u2019s QuickBooks records freight expenses were initially \nadded to the inventory account and then moved to the freight expense COGS account for each ton \nof sand that was sold.  See Dkt. No. 276 at 1.  As a result, they argue, the QuickBooks balance for \nfreight expense  COGS  as of September 30, 2018, does not reflect costs that were attributable to \nsand that had not yet been sold.  That assertion, however, is not supported by the NIS QuickBooks \nrecords.  The only times the QuickBooks inventory balance changed in 2018 were when an \ninventory adjustment was made at the end of each month.  See PX205.  There do not appear to \nhave been any debits or credits made to the inventory account to accrue freight expenses or transfer \nthem to COGS when tons of sand were sold in 2018.  See id.  Mo reover, the entries to the freight \nexpense COGS account in QuickBooks appear to correspond to invoices payable to the shipper (e.g., Union Pacific railroad) rather than to sand sold to NIS\u2019s customers.  See id.   At bottom, the \nplaintiffs \u2019 argument rests on  the ipse dixit assertion that, because the freight expenses are listed \nunder the \u201ccost of goods  sold\u201d category in QuickBooks, that account must only include expenses \nattributable to sand already  sold.  See Dkt. No. 276 at 1.   \nThe plaintiffs also allege that \u201cthe August/September method\u201d of calculating inventory \nfailed to \u201cadd the freight cost to COGS or reduce the inventory accordingly.\u201d  Id.   However, a \nreview of the entries to the inventory account in QuickBooks does not indicate that the inventory and COGS accounts were treated any differently in August and September than they were in  the \nother months in 2018.  See PX205.  Ultimately, I find that t here is no basis to conclude that freight \nexpenses were initially added to inventory and then moved to COGS  as tons of sand were sold, as \nthe plaintiffs assert.  If anything, the monthly inventory adjustments, such as those at issue here, appear to have served the purpose of allocating expenses between the QuickBooks COGS and inventory balances.\n \n27 \n one ton of sand wa s $43.56.  Notably, multiplying the number of tons of sand en route and in basin \nby $43.56 per  ton of sand amounts to approximately $2.945 million in  freight costs, which is within \ntwo percent of the discrepancy in freight costs identified by the plaintiffs . \nMr. Wills\u2019 reconciliation appears to be an effort to account for th e costs actually \nattributable to the sand sold year -to-date as of September 30, 2018, which would not necessarily \nbe reflected in the QuickBooks balance for freight costs .  I therefore attribute no weight to the \ndiscrepancy identified by the plaintiffs with respect to freight costs.   \nAs for the brokerage costs, the plaintiffs correctly point out  that Mr. Wills\u2019 reconciliation \ndoes not explicitly list  as a component of its cost of goods sold calculation  the $3.45 million in \nbrokerage costs that are shown in QuickBooks .  However, the plaintiffs overlook that Mr. Wills\u2019 \noverall calculation of production COGS resulted in a number that  was approximately $3.7 million \nhigher than that shown in  the QuickBooks \u201cProduction COGS\u201d balance.  Upon close examination, \nthe discrepancy between Mr. Wills\u2019 calculation of production COGS  and the QuickBooks \n\u201cProduction COGS\u201d balance appears to account for the brokerage costs that the plaintiffs assert \nare \u201cmissing ,\u201d as explained below.  \nThere are two components of Mr. Wills\u2019 reconciliation that combine to form his calculation \nof production COGS.  First, Mr. Wills multiplied the number of tons of sand that had been sold \nyear-to-date by $19.02 per ton.  That  calculation alone resulted in an amount that was $2.5 million \nhigher than the QuickBooks \u201cProduction COGS\u201d balance.15  See PX205; DX212.  Second, t he NIS \n \n15  As shown in PX205, QuickBooks lists the \u201c5090 Production COGS\u201d balance as $14.43 \nmillion for the period of January 1, 2018, through September 30, 2018, which would appear to be \napproximately $5.1 million lower than Mr. Wills\u2019 calculation.  However, t hat QuickBooks balance \nincludes the COGS adjustment that was made for September 2018 as a result of Mr. Wills\u2019 \nreconciliation .  For purposes of determining whether and to what extent there were discrepancies \nbetween the QuickBooks balances and the amounts shown in Mr. Wills\u2019 reconciliation, the operative QuickBooks balances are those that were present in QuickBooks at the time Mr. Wills \n28 \n QuickBooks rec ords also include $1.2 million in reclamation expenses in \u201cProduction COGS,\u201d \nwhereas Mr. Wills broke those reclamation costs out separately .  See PX205; DX212.16  Mr. Wills\u2019 \ninventory reconciliation therefore reflected a total production COGS amount that was $3.7 million \nhigher than the QuickBooks balance for \u201cProduction COGS.\u201d17  \nThe brokerage costs referred to by the plaintiffs are listed in QuickBooks as \u201c 5950 Trading \nCost of Goods Sold.\u201d  PX205.  That is, those brokerage costs are costs attributable to \u201ctrading \nsand\u201d rather than \u201cproduction sand.\u201d  In his inventory reconciliation, Mr. Wills accounted for the \ncosts associated with trading sand by including them in his calculation of production COGS.  See \nDX212 (\u201cSALES 8.31.2018 YTD\u201d worksheet, including sales of both production sand and trading sand).  Notably, the $3.45 million in brokerage costs accounts for approximately 93 percent of the $3.7 million discrepancy between M r. Wills\u2019 production COGS amount and the QuickBooks \n \nconducted his reconciliation.  Because the September 2018 COGS adjustment was entered into \nQuickBooks after (and as a result of)  Mr. Wills\u2019 reconciliation, it obviously should not be \nconsidered as part of the QuickBooks \u201cProduction COGS\u201d balance for purposes of the present analysis.  Excluding that adjustment, the QuickBooks production COGS balance w as $17.02 \nmillion  at the time Mr. Wills conducted his reconciliation , which is $2.5 million lower than the \nnumber that appears in Mr. Wills\u2019 spreadsheet.  See id.    \n \n16  In QuickBooks, reclamation costs are tracked using the \u201c5400 Reclamation Expenses\u201d \naccount, which is part of the \u201c5090 Production COGS\u201d balance discussed in footnote 15, supra.  PX205.\n \n17  The plaintiffs argue that the court\u2019s analysis of this issue should also exclude the $4.4 \nmillion inventory adjustment made in August  2018 because Mr. Wills\u2019 analysis attempts to \ncalculate the year -to-date cost of goods sold.  Dkt. No. 276 at 2.  There are two problems with that \nargument.  First, the question presented by the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the brokerage costs were \u201cmissing\u201d from  Mr. Wills\u2019 reconciliation is  whether  the brokerage costs were accounted for when \nMr. Wills conducted his analysis for September 2018.  Regardless of the accuracy of the August 2018 adjustment, it would have been present in the QuickBooks records at the time of his reconciliation (unlike the September adjustment , which was made as a result of his analysis ), and \ntherefore should not be excluded for purposes of evaluating Mr. Wills\u2019 calculation of production COGS.  Second, to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning would seem to require that all of the COGS \nadjustments for the months of January through July be excluded from  the production COGS  \nbalance, yet the plaintiffs  do not advocate any such measure.\n \n29 \n \u201cProduction COGS\u201d balance.18  Accordingly, I do not find that Mr. Wills\u2019 failure to explicitly \ninclude brokerage costs in his inventory reconciliation is evidence that his calculations were \ninaccurate in any respect.  \n I n any event, the exchange of emails and text messages between Mr. Gilbertson and \nMessrs. Hajas and Dore between October 9 and October 1 5, 2018, show that Mr. Gilbertson and \nothers at NIS disclosed the total amount of sand en route and in basin and disclosed that NIS was \nusing a revised method for accounting for inventory, which resulted in higher inventory values for August and September 2018.  See PX212.012; PX136; PX139; PX15 6; PX159.  Thus, the use of \na new methodology for calculating inventory and the explanation  for the higher inventor y values \nfor August and September 2018 were not concealed from the plaintiffs.   \nWhile the evidence on the inventory issue leaves some questions unanswered, the \noverriding problem for the plaintiffs is that they bear the burden of proof  on this issue .  And a fter \nassessing all the evidence offered by the parties regarding the 2018 inventory values, I find that the plaintiffs have not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the inventory numbers on the August and September 2018 financial statements were inaccurate.  In particular, the plaintiffs\u2019 \nfailure to call, either live or by deposition, account ants Darren Kray and Matt Wills, and accounting \nassistant Megan Christenson, all of whom were deeply involved in calculating NIS\u2019s inventory \n \n18  The plaintiffs argue that the court\u2019s analysis fails to consider that NIS\u2019s QuickBooks \nrecords do not include brokerage costs in the \u201cProduction COGS\u201d balance.  Dkt. No. 276 at 2.  \nThat argument misunderstands the court\u2019s analysis.  T he $3.7 million disc repancy between Mr. \nWills\u2019 production COGS and the QuickBooks Production COGS balance is largely attributable to \nthe fact that Mr. Wills included brokerage costs in production COGS, whereas the QuickBooks records do not.  Put another way, if Mr. Wills had listed the brokerage costs separately in DX212, rather than as part of production COGS, there would be a  discrepancy of only about  $250,000 \nbetween the production COGS in DX212 and the pre -adjustment QuickBooks Production COGS \nbalance, which is much less t han the $3.45 million in \u201cmissing\u201d brokerage costs that the plaintiffs \nallege.\n \n30 \n values for August  31 and September 30, 2018, left a serious gap in the plaintiffs\u2019 proof on the \ninventory issue.  In addition, the  lack of corroborating evidence supporting Mr. Dore\u2019s expert \ntestimony is troubling, particularly in view of the evidence supporting the number s that appeared \non the financial statements.  Accordingly, I find that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of \nshowing that the defendants breach ed the Equity Purchase Agreement by providing financial \nstatements with inaccurate inventory amounts.  \n Furthermore, even if the $13.5 million and $16 million inventory figures that appeared in \nthe financial statements were inaccurate, the plaintiffs have not established that those numbers \nplayed any role in the final purchase price.  As early as September 14, 2018, nearly one month before the plaintiffs received the August and September financial statements, Mr. Hajas  made his \noffer of $6.5 million for Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s interest s in NIS.  PX117.  When  Mr. Hajas later lowered \nthat offer to $6 million, the reason s he gave for that change in the price w ere \u201cmarket movement\u201d  \nand a reduced EBITDA forecast .  Those factors, Mr. Hajas said in an October 8, 2018, email, \njustified the \u201cmodest reprice\u201d of $500,000.  PX133; Tr. 604:15\u201324; see also Tr. 323:12\u2013324:10 \n(Mr. Hajas discussing his reasoning for requesting a reprice).  At that time, NIS\u2019s financials valued the inventory as of August 31, 2018, at about $8. 7 million.  PX126 .002 (October 1, 2018, email \nfrom Tim Brady to Shane Dore).  The revis ed inventory value s of $13.5 million for August 31 and \n$16 million for September 30 were provided to Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore between  October 9 and \n12.  PX136;  PX136-1; PX143; PX143-1; PX149.  I find that the adjusted inventory values for \nAugust and September, which surfaced only a week before the closing, had no effect on the plaintiffs\u2019 decision to go through with the equity purchase or the  price they were willing to pay, \nparticularly in light of the fact that the parties\u2019 negotiations over price were predicated on the 31 \n inventory value of about $8.7 million that Mr. Hajas assigned to the company in his August \nvaluation.  DX183.   \n In sum, based on the foregoing analysis I find that the plaintiff s have not proved that the \nadjustments to inventory value between August and October 2018 violated the defendants\u2019 \nwarranties in the EPA .  In any event, I find that the adjustments did not result in injury to the \nplaintiffs by causing them to make an inves tment they otherwise would not have made or by paying \nmore for that investment than they otherwise would have  paid .  \n2. The \u201cUndisclosed Contracts\u201d Component  \nThe other principal component of the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim consists of the six \nundiscl osed contracts that the plaintiffs contend were material to the transaction and should have \nbeen disclosed pursuant to Section 2.15 of the EPA.  The plaintiffs focus particularly on the fact that each of those contracts contained provisions that required N IS to purchase a minimum quantity \nof goods or services over time or face financial penalties if those minimums were not met.  \nAccording to the plaintiffs, those ongoing commitments reduced the overall value of NIS and made \nit less \u201cnimble\u201d in the event of a slowdown, a factor that was important to Mr. Hajas in deciding \nwhether to purchase the defendants\u2019  interests  in NIS.  \nThe defendants contend that the six contracts in dispute were not \u201cmaterial,\u201d and that the  \ndefendants  were therefore not required to disclose  them .  The  defendants  also contend that the \nplaintiffs were aware of the contracts even though the  contracts  were not specifically listed in \nSchedule 2.15 of the EPA. \nWhile Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore were aware that NIS did business with several of the \nvendors who were part ies to the six contracts in dispute , the evidence does not show that the  \nplaintiffs  were aware of all the provisions of the contracts that imposed long- term commitments 32 \n on NIS, such as  minimum required purc hases of goods or services with  penalty provisions if those \nminimums were not reached. \nA theme that runs throughout the defendants\u2019 argument with respect to the six undisclosed \ncontracts is that those contracts \u2014even in light of the provisions requiring NIS  to purchase \nminimum amounts of sand or services \u2014were on the whole beneficial to the company.  For t hat \nreason, they argue, the failure to disclose those contracts should not be regarded as a breach of the \nEPA, or at least should not result in an award of damages to the plaintiffs.  \nThere are several problems with that argument.  First, the failure to disclose material \ncontracts is a breach of the EPA without regard to whether the contracts would have been beneficial to the plaintiffs on balance.  Second, and relatedly, the purpose of the disclosure provisions in the EPA was to inform the purchasers of any hidden risks they were undertaking with the purchase.  Contingent liabilities of the sort found in the six subject contracts present just such a risk, and the contract makes clear that it was not the defendants\u2019 prerogative to make a unilateral determination \nfor the plaintiffs that those risk s did not outweigh the benefi cial features of the contracts.  Third, \neven if overall benefit were a basis for mitigating the award of damages, the defendants have not made a persuasive showing as to the benefits conferred by  those contracts, and in particular they \nhave failed to show that the offsetting benefits the  defendants may have obtained as a result of \nagreeing to the mandatory minimum provisions outweighed the risks  associated with those \nprovisions.  \nWith respect to the six contracts  at issue , I make the following findings:  \n  First, n one of the six contracts were disclosed in Schedule 2.15 of the EPA. \n   \nSecond, all  six contested contracts were material, in that each committed NIS to significant \npayments for currently supplied goods or services, and each had the potential to result in significant 33 \n financial burdens for NIS, particularly in the event of a downturn in the market for frac sand.   \nSpecifically:  \n\u2022 The Chetek Express contract obligated NIS to pay Chetek Express a minimum of $45,000 \nper month for four months of trucking services and a minimum of $90,000 per month for \n44 months of trucking services, re sulting in a total obligation of $4,140,000, even if the \ncompany did not use Chetek Express  to do any work.   \n\u2022 The Sioux Creek Silica contract obligated NIS to pay approximately $2,500,000 for sand \nto be purchased over the remaining period of that contract even if NIS had no customers \nfor that sand.   \n\u2022 The CIG contract for trans loading services contained a minimum commitment of 20,000 \ntons per month, with a shortfall fee of $6 per ton, giving rise to an exposure of $720,000  \nfor the remaining six months of tha t contract.   \n\u2022 The RJR contract for trans loading services contained a minimum monthly fee of $60,000, \nexposing NIS to liability of $600,000 over the 10 months remaining in that contract.  \n\u2022 The Mascoutin Heights railcar lease contract committed NIS to lease 1 15 rail cars at $295 \nper car per month for 16 months, for a total expense of about $540,000.  \n\u2022 The SMBC railcar lease contract committed NIS to lease 99 rail cars at $450 per car per \nmonth for six months, for a total expense of about $267,000. \nThe defendants argue that those expenses, when compared to the annual revenues of NIS  \n(roughly $82 million in 2018) , are inconsequential and that those contracts were therefore not \nrequired to be included among the \u201cmaterial\u201d contracts set forth in Schedule 2.15.   \nThe E PA does not define the term \u201cmaterial,\u201d but the term is a familiar one in the law , and \nparticularly in the context of a sale of securities.  An omission in that setting  is regarded as material 34 \n if there is \u201ca substantial likelihood that the disclosure of th e omitted fact would have been viewed \nby the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made \navailable.\u201d  Basic Inc. v. Levinson , 485 U.S. 224, 231\u201332 (1988) (quoting TSC Indus., Inc. v. \nNorthway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976)).  It can safely be assumed that in the EPA, a legal document trans ferring interests in securities, the term \u201cmaterial\u201d was used in the sense relevant to \nsecurities transactions.  That is, a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d in this context if a reasonabl y prudent purchaser \nwould want to be aware of it before purchasing the security.  See 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.405 (Securit ies \nand Exchange Commission regulation defining \u201cmaterial\u201d  as relating to \u201c those matters to which \nthere is a substantial likelihood that a rea sonable investor would attach importance in determining \nwhether to purchase the security  registered\u201d ).   \nI find that all six contracts identified by the plaintiffs were \u201cmaterial\u201d within the meaning \nof that term as used in the EPA and therefore should have  been included in Schedule 2.15.  In \nsituations in which a contract to purchase securities  calls for the disclosure of all material contracts, \na reasonably prudent investor would want and expect to be informed of any contracts that would impose significant  ongoing financial obligations and potential risks on the purchaser.  Mr. Hajas, \nwho had significant prior familiarity with NIS\u2019s business, would have known that the company needed to have contracts for various services required to mine, refine, transport, and deliver the \nsand.  For that reason, if the EPA had not contained a provision specifically requiring the disclosure \nof all material contracts, the failure to disclose that the company had various contracts for services might not have been regarded as a  material omission.  But because there was such a provision in \nthe EPA, the omission of any mention of the six identified contracts  was material .  That is  \nparticularly true in light of the fact that each of the six contracts at issue imposed obligations on \nNIS that would extend after the sale and would apply even if the company did little or no business.   35 \n I find that even for a company with annual sales in the range of $80 million, the presence of \ncontingent liabilities ranging from  $250,000 to more than $4 million  would be material.  The \nfailure to disclose those contracts therefore constituted a breach of the EPA by the defendants. \nWith that said, it is important to distinguish among the six contracts in assessing whether \ntheir non- disclosure caused injury to the plaintiffs.  And on this issue, the various contracts stand \ndifferently.  \nSioux Creek Silica .   The evidence at trial showed that at the meeting  between Mr. Hajas, \nMr. Dore, Mr. Swanson, and Brian Gilbertson on July 9, 2018, Mr. Hajas  and Mr. Dore w ere told \nabout the Sioux Creek Silica contract, including that it contained a commitment for NIS to \npurchase 500,000 tons of sand from Sioux Creek through June 9, 2019.19  Tr. 1019:21\u20131034:11 ; \nDX188 .  Because Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore w ere awar e of the Sioux Creek Silica contract and the \npurchase commitment in that contract, I find that the plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the omission \nof reference to the Sioux Creek Silica contract in Schedule 2.15 of the EPA, even though the failure to include that contract in Schedule 2.15 constituted a breach of the contract.  The plaintiffs are therefore not entitled to any remedy based on the non-disclosure of the Sioux Creek agreement. \nChetek E\nxpress .  The  evidence shows that Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore were aware that Chetek \nExpress was providing trucking services between the NIS facilities in Wisconsin, but it does not show that they were aware of the provision of the contract with Chetek Express that contained  a \n \n19  Mr. Dore\u2019s notes, at DX188, use the term \u201cVarde,\u201d which refers to a private equity \ngroup that  was affiliated with the Sioux Creek Silica mine.  Tr. 1013:3\u20136.  Although the pl aintiffs \nsuggest that a discussion that took place two months prior to due diligence should not be relevant \nto their contract claim, the evidence showed that Mr. Dore was aware of and interested in NIS\u2019s \nrelationship with Varde.  Indeed, Mr. Dore testified that he introduced Mr. Gilbertson to the Varde \ninvestors, Tr. 1010:23\u201325, and he initiated the conversation at the July  9 meeting by asking: \u201c Are \nyou still talking to, from a working perspective, the Varde folks with their wet plant and co -\nmarketing and those kinds of things?\u201d  Tr. 1024:9\u201312.   \n36 \n minimum hauling commitment that could result i n penalties totaling as much a s $4,140,000 if \nChetek Express were not used to transport sand over the remaining life of its contract with NIS.  \nMoreover, the evidence show ed that such commitments were not common  in contracts for trucking \nservices with companies such as Chetek Express, so there was no reason for Mr. Hajas or Mr. Dore \nto expect that NIS had such an arrangement with Chetek Express.   \nThe defendants argue that Chetek Express had never exercised its minimum charge rights, \nfrom which they suggest that there was no significant risk that the minimum charge provision of \nthe contract would be enforced.  There is no evidence to support that view, however .  In the event \nof a failure to use Chetek Express trucking services for the minimum required amount of hauling, Chetek Express had legal grounds for enforcing that provision of the contract.  The fac t that it had \nnever done so in the past may simply indicate that during the relationship between the parties there was no extended period in which trucking services were not needed .  Past experience was no \nguarantee that trucking services would not be needed in the event of a down market in the oil business or in the demand for frac sand.   \nThe defendants also point out that after taking control of NIS, the plaintiffs renegotiated \nthe agreement with Chetek Express and arranged to have the mandatory minimum requirement removed from the contract.  But at the time of the sale, there was no guarantee that such an arrangement could be reached, or for what price.\n20  I therefore find that the failure to disclose the \n \n20  Mr. Gilbertson testified about the circumstances that led to the renegotiation of the \nChetek  Express contract.  He explained that after this lawsuit was brought, he spoke with his \ncousin, Chris Johnson, who ran Chetek Express, and explained that Mr. Hajas had identified the \nminimums in the Chetek Express contract as one of the grounds for the lawsuit.  Tr. 678:7\u2013679-3.  \nMr. Gilbertson then advised Mr. Johnson to remove the minimums, and Mr. Johnson agreed.  Id. ; \nsee also  Tr. 483:13\u2013484:2.  Although that agreement may have eliminated the problem going \nforward, it was not clear at the time of the equity purchase that Chetek Express would agree to \nremove the minimums set forth in the contract.  That contract therefore imposed potential obligations on NIS that were not disclosed prior to the purchase.  Moreover, Mr. Hajas testified \n37 \n Chetek Express contract constituted a breach of the EPA that entitles the plaintiffs to some form \nof relief.  \nRJR Trucking.  The RJR Trucking contract for transload services bound NIS to a monthly \nminimum fee of $60,000 for ten months.  NIS\u2019s exposure, in the event it did not meet the monthly minimum amount of tran sloading services, was therefore up to $600,000, not a negligible amount.   \nAlthough the plaintiffs were aware of a contract with RJR that was to expire on October 31, 2018, the evidence does not show that they were aware that in September 2018, NIS entered into a new \ncontract with RJR in which NIS agreed to pay a monthly minimum fee of $60,000 to RJR for a \n12-month term.  \nThe defendants argue that the RJR contract was beneficial to NIS  and necessary to \ntransload sand in order to fulfill the company\u2019s contract to sell sand to Marathon .  The defendants \npoint out that there was no evidence that the RJR contract was not competitively pri ced, and they \ncontend that the RJR contract was entirely set off by the Marathon supply contract, which committed Marathon to purchase 100,000 tons of sand annually from NIS, for which RJR  would \nprovide the transload services.    \nThe defendants\u2019 \u201cset -off\u201d a rgument amounts to a contention that the RJR contract could \nnot cause loss to NIS because Marathon was committed to purchase more sand from NIS than the minimum transload amount promised to RJR.  The problem with that argument, however, is that under its contract, Marathon was free to require the sand to be delivered to at least one location where RJR did not operate.  Compare PX100 at \u00b6 2 (Marathon contract identifying possible \n \nthat as a condition of Chet ek Express \u2019s agreeing to remove the mandatory minimums in the \ncontract, NIS had to agree that Chetek Express would receive more than half of NIS\u2019s business.  \nTr. 480:21\u2013483:3.  That concession clearly indicates that the parties attached value to the \nmandat ory minimum haulage provision of Chetek Express\u2019s contract. 38 \n transload locations as Pocasset, OK; El Reno, OK; or Kingfisher, OK), with PX006 at \u00b6 1 (RJR \ncontract identifying transload facilities at Pocasset, OK, and El Reno, OK).  Thus, the two contracts \nwere not strictly set -offs.  Moreover, the set- off arrangemen t would be effective only if Marathon \nabided by its contractual obligation to purchase 100,000 tons of sand annually and NIS were able to supply that amount of sand to Marathon.  If either of those contingencies failed, the RJR contract could become a liab ility for NIS.  Thus, the failure to list the RJR contract in Schedule 2.15 \nconstituted a breach of the EPA.  The risk associated with the RJR contract would appear to be smaller than the risk associated with some of the other undisclosed contracts, but the defendants \u2014\ntaking an all -or-nothing approach\u2014did not offer evidence regarding how much less risk that \ncontract entailed.  The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to relief based on the breach of the EPA attributable to the failure to disclose the RJR contr act. \nCIG.  \n The CIG contract for transload services in Jal, New Mexico, required CIG to provide \ntransload services for $6 per ton, and it contained a minimum commitment of 20,000 tons per \nmonth for the remaining six months on the contract.  The defendants argue that the contractual rate \nfor transload services  was competitive and that the contract benefited the company by ensuring \nthat transload services would be available at one of the company\u2019s busiest delivery points.  Nonetheless, the contract committed N IS to paying a minimum of $120,000 per month for six \nmonths even if CIG transloaded no sand for NIS during that period.\n21  For that reason, the breach \ncreated an undisclosed risk for NIS for which the plaintiffs are entitled to a remedy.  \n \n21  During his testimony, Mr. Gilbertson noted that, after the equity purchase, NIS extended \nthe contract with CIG, which Mr. Gilbertson suggested was an indication that the plaintiffs \nregarded that contract as favorable.  Tr. 537:5 \u2013538:1 , 667:23\u2013668:7 .  Mr. Hajas , however, testified  \nthat the CIG contract was extended with a modification that  allowed NIS to meet the mandatory \nminimums over a longer period of time.  See Tr. 406:22\u2013411:7.  Mr. Hajas explained that the \ncompany knew i t would not be shipping any more sand to Jal, New Mexico, where CIG was \nlocated, during the initial term of the contract .  See id.   The  company therefore negotiated the \n39 \n Mascoutin Heights and SMBC Rail Services.  The two railcar leases committed NIS to \nlease terms of 16 months (for Mascoutin Heights) and six months (for SMBC).  The defendants \nwere aware of the fact that NIS leased railcars from SMBC and Mascoutin Heights, but the \nevidence d oes not show that the defendants were aware of the lengths of the two lease terms  or the \nexistence of any continuing obligation with respect to the railcar leases .  The Mascoutin Heights \ncontract obligated NIS to pay approximately $540,000 over a 16 -month period, and the SMBC \ncontract committed NIS to pay approximately $267,000 over a six-month period.  Those amounts would have been due regardless of whether NIS produced or sold any sand during the lease term and regardless of whether the railcars were actu ally used.  For that reason, the defendants\u2019 failure \nto disclose those contracts entitles the plaintiffs to some relief.  \nTo be sure, there is force to the defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiffs knew NIS leased \nsome of the rail cars that it used and therefore the plaintiffs would naturally understand that the leases would continue for at least some period of time.  Nonetheless, the length of the leases and the financial commitment associated with those leases constituted a potential burden for NIS going forward, the nature and dimension of which should have been disclosed to the plaintiffs pursuant \nto the EPA. \nAt various points at trial and in their Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, \nthe defendants have suggest ed that Mr. Gilbertson acted in reliance on outside counsel in deciding \nthat the six contracts now in dispute did not need to be disclosed in Schedule 2.15 of the EPA.  \n \nextension of the contract in the hope that during the extended period it would be able to ship enough \nsand to meet the minimum requirements of the contract for the entire contractual period.   See id.  \nIt did not work out that way, and the company ended up losing more money on the CIG contract \nthan it would have lost under the original contract.  See id.   I find Mr. Hajas\u2019s explanation for the \nextension credible, and therefore I do not agree that the post -purchase decision to extend the \ncontract indicates that the initial contract did not impose an undisclosed contingent liability on NIS.    40 \n That argument  fails.  Although lawyers from the Faegre  Baker Daniels  law firm , which represented \nNIS, were involved in preparing the EPA, the evidence does not show that they compiled what \npurported to be a complete list of ma terial contracts or signed off on the list that NIS prepared for \nthe EPA.  To the contrary, the evidence shows that the attorneys directed Mr. Gilbertson to \ncomplete the list of material contracts, and he undertook to do so.  See DX110.019; Tr. 709:3\u201310, 717:2 0\u2013718:7.  Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s failure to include those contracts is not chargeable to the \nattorneys, as nothing in the attorneys\u2019 conduct can be viewed as having in any way s uggested that \nthe six contracts here at issue were not material  or did not need t o be disclosed in Schedule 2.15 \nof the EPA .    \n3. Other Claims of Misrepresentation or Nondisclosure \nThe plaintiffs raise three additional points in support of their claim that the defendants \nmisrepresented NIS\u2019s financial condition.   \nFirst, the plaintiffs c omplain that the discretionary bonus payments made by NIS in 2018 \nshould have been accrued on the company\u2019s financial statements , but were not .  The parties agree \nthat a ccrual of bonuses is required only if the bonuses are expected .  The evidence show s that NIS \nwas not obligated to pay bonuses and that there was su bstantial uncertainty about whether and \nwhen bonus payments would be paid, and in what amounts .  Tr. 690:2\u201320.  The  evidence also \nshows that the plaintiffs were aware that NIS  only sometimes paid bonuses to its employees.  \nDX082; Tr. 431: 2\u2013435: 9.  In light of those facts, it was not unreasonable for the company not to \naccrue the bonus payments on its financial statements .  The failure to do so therefore did not \nconstitute a breach o f the EPA .  Moreover, in light of the plaintiffs\u2019 awareness that the company \nsometimes paid bonuses , but that bonuses were neither guaranteed nor invariably awarded, any 41 \n failure to accrue the bonuses on the company\u2019s books did not affect the price the plai ntiffs paid for \nthe equity they purchased. \nSecond, the plaintiffs argue that NIS booked two large accounts receivable at full value \nrather than discounting them.  Those accounts receivable were reported without discount in the \ncompany\u2019s 2017 audit and the June 30, 2018, aging accounts receivable report, both of which the plaintiffs saw before the sale closed.  Therefore, even though the plaintiffs contend that those \nreceivables should not have been carried on NIS\u2019s books at full value, the plaintiffs were a ware of \nthe receivables throughout the transaction, and if they regarded the receivables as overvalued, they were in a position to make their own assessment of the effect of those accounts on the company\u2019s value; there was no failure of disclosure with res pect to the accounts.   As to one of the account s \nreceivable, the \u201cTransload Sand Sales\u201d or \u201cJim Berry\u201d receivable, the plaintiffs were made aware of that account receivable during due diligence but did not discuss that account with Mr. Gilbertson .  Tr. 688:16\u201325, 1499:12\u20131500:7.  As to the second  account receivable,  the \u201cEcoStim\u201d \nreceivable,  the plaintiffs were also aware of that account during due diligence.  Tr. 1499:12\u2013\n1500:7.  Moreover, Mr. Gilbertson testified that because the EcoStim receivable was lienable, he \nwas not concerned that the company would be un able to recover the amount due.   Tr. 689: 18\u201321.  \nThat conclusion was not shown to be unreasonable.  The treatment of the accounts receivable on \nthe company\u2019s books therefore does not constitute a breach of the EPA.  \nThird, the plaintiffs complain that during due diligence, the defendant s represented that \nthere was a $1,304,012.42 receivable held in escrow pending the resolution of a lawsuit , and that \nNIS expected to receive the funds.  See Tr. 583:12 \u2013587:9.  The plaintiffs state that the lawsuit was \nnot resolved and that they incurred additional legal fees in connection with the matter.   However, \nMr. Hajas assigned no value to that receivable in his valuation of the company.  Tr. 304:21\u2013305:3, 42 \n 310:11\u2013312:4, 589:14\u201322.  Nothing about that transaction constituted a material non-disclosure or \nmisrepresentation to the plaintiffs  for purposes of the EPA . \nThe plaintiffs\u2019 complaints about the three accounts receivable all have this in common: \neach of the accounts receivable was disclosed to the plaintiffs; none of the three were discounted \non NI S\u2019s books; there was some expectation on the part of NIS management that those receivables \ncould be collected , either directly or through a lien; and other than the fact that the company\u2019s \nbooks carried those receivables at full value, the plaintiffs do not assert that there were any misrepresentations as to the status of those receivables.  Under those circumstances, I find that NIS\u2019s treatment of the three receivables at issue did not constitute a breach of the defendants\u2019 obligations under the EPA. \nThe net effect of the claim regarding the six undisclosed contracts, the unaccrued bonuses , \nand the accounts receivable is this:  The essential features of one of the contracts (Sioux Creek \nSilica) w ere disclosed to the plaintiffs in advance of the sale and the refore the failure to list that \ncontract on Schedule 2.15 warrants no relief.  Critical features of the other five  contracts (Chetek \nExpress, RJR, CIG , Mascoutin Heights , and SMBC ) were not disclosed .  The failure to disclose \nthose contracts constitutes a breach  of the EPA , and the breach with respect to those contracts \nwarrants recovery.   The plaintiffs \u2019 complaints about the alleged nondisclosure of bonuses and the \nvaluation of accounts receivable were not actionable breache s of the EPA.    \nBecause I have found that the defendants breached their obligations set forth in the EPA in \nsome respects, the plaintiffs are entitled to monetary relief, although considerably less sweeping \nrelief than they sought in their complaint, as discussed in Part C , below. 43 \n B.  The Fraud Claims  \nIn addition to their breach of contract claim, the plaintiffs have raised federal securities \nfraud and common law fraud claims against the defendants.  \nTo establish securities fraud, the plaintiffs must prove that the defendant s (1) made a \nmisstatement or an omission of a material fact;  (2) with scienter ; (3) in connection with the \npurchase or the sale of a security ; (4) upon which the plaintiff s reasonab ly relied ; and (5) that the \nplaintiffs \u2019 reliance was the proximate cause of thei r injury.  AES Corp. v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 \nF.3d 174, 178 (3d Cir. 2003) . \nTo establish common law fraud under Delaware law , the plaintiffs must prove (1) that the \ndefendant s falsely represented or omitted facts that the defendant s had a duty to disclose; (2) that \nthe defendant s knew or believed the representation was false or made the representation with a \nreckless indifference to the truth; (3) that the defendant s intended to induce the plaintiff s to act or \nrefrain from acting; (4) that the plaintiff s acted in justifiable reliance on the representation; and (5) \nthat the plaintiff s were injured by their  reliance.   Abry Partners V, L.P. v. F & W Acquisition LLC , \n891 A.2d 1032, 1050 (Del. Ch. 2006) . \nBoth causes of action require scienter on the part of the defendants.  That is, the plaintiffs \nmust prove that the defendants knew that statements they made were false or misleading, or that \nthe defendants acted recklessly with respect to the truth of th ose statements.  See id. ; Tellabs, Inc. \nv. Makor Issues & Rts., Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 319 n.3 (2007)  (\u201cEvery Court of Appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that a plaintiff may meet the scienter requirement [on a feder al \nsecurities fraud claim] by showing that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly, though the \nCircuits differ on the degree of recklessness required.\u201d).  Although I have found that the defendants breached the EPA by failing to disclose several mat erial contracts, which could constitute a 44 \n material omission for purposes of their fraud claims, I find that neither Mr. Gilbertson nor the \ndefendant entities (through their agent or agents) intentionally made false statements or acted recklessly with respect to the truth of their statements.  \nThere is s ubstantial  evidence in this case suggesting that Mr. Gilbertson (and, by extension, \nthe other defendants) intended to be as transparent as possible with Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore regarding the transaction.  First , when receiving the August 2018 financial statements from Carlson \nAdvisors, Mr. Gilbertson sought to confirm that the statements were \u201csolid\u201d before forwarding them to the plaintiffs , because he wanted to \u201cmake sure everything was . . . 100 percent accura te, \nbeyond question.\u201d  DX088; Tr. 649:14\u201319.  Second, Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s request to add an attorney\u2019s  \nfees provision to  the EPA, particularly in view of the plaintiffs failure to request one during the \nnegotiations, is evidence that he did not act with fraudulent intent in negotiating the transaction.  See Tr. 624:1\u2013625:24.  Third, Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore both testified that they were never denied \naccess to any specific information that they requested from Mr. Gilbertson or others at NIS.  Tr. \n294:11\u2013295:19 (H ajas); Tr. 974:23\u2013975:5.  And more generally, I found Mr. Gilbertson to be a \ncredible witness , and I give considerable weight to his representations that he wanted to give a \ncomplete and accurate disclosure of the company\u2019s status to the plaintiffs prior t o the closing of \nthe transaction.  See, e.g., Tr. 587:8\u2013588:1. \nThe only evidence in the record that might  suggest  recklessness or  an intent to deceive on \nthe part of anyone associated with NIS is the incident involving Brian Gilbertson\u2019s \u201cnapkin math.\u201d  In that incident, which occurred on October 10, only days before the sale closed, Brian Gilbertson  \nreceived an inventory reconciliation worksheet from Ms. Christenson that  may have been  \ninconsistent with the $13 million inventory figure that appeared in t he August 2018 financials.  He \nthen did a quick calculation, which he shared with the plaintiffs  and which appeared to confirm 45 \n the inventory figure on the August 2018 financial statements .  See PX144; PX144- 1; PX145.  That \nevidence is insufficient to estab lish scienter, however, for several reasons.  First, as discussed \nabove, it is not clear that Brian Gilbertson\u2019s characterization of the components of the inventory \ncalculation was inaccurate.  Second, there is no indication that his  \u201cnapkin math\u201d was the product \nof deceptive intent .  And  third, it does not appear that Ryan Gilbertson was in any way involved \nin that alleged misrepresentation.  Ryan  Gilbertson was not included on the email from Ms. \nChristenson to Brian Gilbertson, nor was he included on Bria n Gilbertson\u2019s email to Mr. Dore \nregarding his \u201cnapkin math.\u201d  See PX144; PX145.  Particularly b ecause there is no evidence in the \nrecord that Brian Gilbertson was authorized to speak on behalf of any defendant (as opposed to NIS itself), I do not find tha t his statements regarding inventory contribute anything of substance \nto the plaintiffs\u2019 effort to establish scienter on the part of the defendants.  \nBecause the plaintiffs have not established that the defendants acted with scienter in \nmaking any alleged m isrepresentations or omissions, I reject the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of securities \nfraud and common law fraud.  Accordingly, I find for the defendants as to those two claims. \nC. Remed y \n Having found that the defendants breached the EPA, I now turn to the ques tion of what \nremedy should be awarded to the plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim.  The plaintiffs request that the court award damages in the amount of $11,115,247.72, the full purchase price paid by the plaintiffs for the defendants\u2019 equity inter ests in NIS.  The plaintiffs argue that but for the \nmisrepresentations made by the defendants, Mr. Hajas would not have entered into the transaction at all and therefore they are entitled to recover the full amount paid on the contract.  In the alternative , the plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to recover the difference between the purchase \nprice and the value of the defendants\u2019 equity interests had the material contracts been disclosed.  46 \n  The ordinary remedy for breach of contract is expectation damages, which seek \u201cto put the \ninjured party in as good a position as if the contract was fully performed.\u201d  12 Timothy Murray, \nCorbin on Contracts \u00a7 61.5 (Matthew Bender ed. 2022).  A different remedy, referred to as \n\u201crestitution\u201d or \u201crescission,\u201d seeks to \u201cr estore the status quo ante and thus . . . put the injured party \nin as good a position as that occupied by that party before the contract was made .\u201d  Id. ; see also \nRestatement (Third) of Restitution & Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 37 cmt. a (2011).  During closing \narguments, the plaintiffs informed the court that they are seeking rescission with respect to only \ntheir fraud claims and not their breach of contract claim.  See Dkt. No. 274 at 143:16\u2013144:20.  In \nother words, they concede that they are not seeking a damages award for the full purchase price with respect to their contract claim.   Accordingly, expectation damages, i.e., an award of damages \nthat \u201c put[s] the injured party in as good a position as if the contract was fully performed,\u201d is the \nappropriate me asure of damages in this case, because I have found for the plaintiffs on only their \nbreach of contract claim.  See Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 61.5.  In establishing the amount of expectation damages they should be awarded, the plaintiffs \nrely on the opinion of  their expert, Dr. Timothy Nantell, who testified regarding the price the \nparties would have agreed to had there been full disclosure and compliance with the warranties in the EPA.  Dr. Nantell testified regarding three different damages models that applied various \ndiscounts to the liabilities associated with the six contracts  that were not disclosed on Schedule \n2.15.  He testified that applying a 20 percent discount to each of those liabilities, which was reflected in his \u201cDamages II\u201d model, was an appropr iate \u201clow end\u201d for the damages analysis .\n22  \nSee Tr. 1587:14\u20131593:6.  In light of the defendants\u2019 failure to offer any competing model for \n \n22  The plaintiffs also rely on the 20% discount in explaining the impact that each contract \nwould have individually on the damages analysis.  See Dkt. No. 269 at 57\u201358.  \n47 \n measuring damages, I find that using a 20% discount is a reasonable approach, and therefore  the \ndiscussion in this sec tion will refer exclusively to Dr. Nantell\u2019s \u201cDamages II\u201d model.  \nStarting from the assumption that the plaintiffs were entitled to prevail in all respects on \ntheir breach of contract and fraud claims, Dr. Nantell testified that the parties would have agree d \nto a purchase price of $3,497,610, and that the plaintiffs would therefore be entitled to the \ndifference between that purchase price and the actual contract price of the EPA , or $7,617,637.  \n Dr. Nantell\u2019s analysis employ s the same \u201cEBITDA multiple\u201d valu ation method used by \nMr. Gilbertson and Mr. Hajas in their valuation spreadsheets.  Generally speaking, Dr. Nantell \nsought to modify the inputs to that valuation model to reflect a  full and  proper disclosure by the \ndefendants.  For example, he modified the inventory input in the EBITDA multiple valuation model to reflect Mr. Dore\u2019s \u201cderived inventory\u201d value, and he increased the liabilities on the balance sheet to account for the continuing liabilities presented by the six undisclosed contracts.  The defendants challenge various aspects of Dr. Nantell\u2019s methodology, but given the ir failure to \noffer a  compe ting theory of damages , I accept Dr. Nantell\u2019s general approach for purposes of \ncalculat ing a  damages award in this case.  \n Dr. Nantell\u2019s damages model assumes that the plaintiffs have prevailed on all aspects of \ntheir liability case.  But they have not prevailed on several important issues going to liability.   At \nthe end of the day, t he only claim on which the plaintiffs are entitled to relief is their breach of \ncontract claim, and they may recover on that claim only to the extent they were injured by the nondisclosure of the Chetek Express, RJR, CIG, Mascoutin Heights , and SMBC contracts.  \nAccordingly, Dr. Nantell\u2019s adjustments for inventory, accounts receivable, employee bonuses, and \nthe Sioux Creek Silica contract will not be considered in determining the proper award of damages \nin this case.  48 \n  Following the bench trial in this case, I asked the parties to include in their proposed \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law a breakdown of how each of the six undisclosed contracts \ncontributes to Dr. Nantell\u2019s overall damages opinion.  The plaintiffs provided a table that outlined how the liability  for each undisclosed contract would impact the value of the class B shares.  Dkt. \nNo. 269 at 58.  That table assumed that the plaintiffs  proved that the inventory was overstated, as \nthey allege.  See id.  at 57 \u201358.  If that were the case, the value of the class A shares would have \nbeen $0, and any damages resulting from the undisclosed contracts would have been seen solely with respect to the class B shares.  See id.   However, I have not found that the inventory was \noverstated, and therefore the class A shares cannot be valued at $0.  In the letter briefs filed by the parties following the closing arguments in this case, it became clear that, if the inventory had not been overstated, the impact of the undisclosed contracts would have been felt by the class A  shares \nonly.\n23  See Dkt. No. 272 at 8; Dkt. No. 273 at 6\u2013 7.  Accordingly, I have adapted the plaintiffs\u2019 \ntable by modifying the numbers  to reflect the impact on the class A shares rather than the class B \nshares.   I have also removed the Sioux Creek contract from the plaintiffs\u2019 table because the non -\ndisclosure of that contract did not result in damage to the plaintiffs.  That table, as modified,24 is \nset forth below: \n \n23  Dr. Nantell testified that the purchase price paid by the plaintiffs reflected an enterprise \nvalue for NIS  of $66 million.  The combined potential liability of the five contracts for which the \nplaintiffs are entitled to recover (assuming a 20% discount, as Dr. Nantell does) is approximately \n$1.25 million.  As reflected in the opinion of Seth Fliegler, the plai ntiffs\u2019 other expert who testified \nat trial, a decrease in enterprise value from $66 million to $64.75 million would have no impact on the value of the class B shares.   PX811.003.  Accordingly, the only effect of the undisclosed \ncontracts would be on the value of the class A shares.\n \n24  In accounting for the liabilities presented by the SMBC and Mascoutin Heights railcar \nlease contracts, Dr. Nantell included an estimated $2,500 return expense per railcar.  See Dkt. No. \n269 at 57.  There was conflicting testimony at trial with respect to whether NIS would incur a cost to return the railcars at the end of each lease.  Mr. Gilbertson testified that when a railcar is shipped, the cost is paid roundtrip, and the only time a return cost is incurred is in the rare e vent that the \nreturn trip is longer than the outbound trip (which was typically from Wisconsin to Oklahoma, \n49 \n Contract  Potential \nLiability \n(\u201cPL\u201d) Effect on Class \nA (PL * 74.2% \n* 24.4%) Indirect \nEffect on \nClass B  \n(PL * 7.7%)  Direct Effect \non Class B  \n(PL * 66.9%) Total Effect on \nPurchase Price  \nChetek  \nExpress   $828,000  $149,908  $0 $0 $149,908  \nMascoutin  \nHeights   $108,560 $19,655 $0 $0 $19,655  \nCIG $144,000  $26,071  $0 $0 $26,071  \nRJR $120,000  $21,726  $0 $0 $21,726  \nSMBC  $53,460  $9,679  $0 $0 $9,679  \nDkt. No. 269 at 57\u201358.  In the table above, the \u201cpotential liability\u201d refers to the total exposure that \neach contract created for NIS multiplied by a 20% discount.  As Dr. Nantell testified, the 20% \ndiscount accounts for the risk associated with each of the six contracts.  Tr. 1587:14\u20131588:2.  Put \ndifferently, the 20% discount accounts for the fact that at the time of the transaction it was possible, but not certain, that NIS would have been forced to pay the shortfall costs associated with those contracts.  \nConsidered in total, the five contracts tha t resulted in injury to the plaintiffs (Chetek  \nExpress , Mascoutin Heights , CIG, RJR, and SMBC) had a combined effect of $227,039 on the \npurchase price.\n25  That is, assuming that the price paid by the plaintiffs for the purchased equity \n \nTexas, or New Mexico).  Tr. 726:6\u2013729:3.  Mr. Hajas and Mr. Dore testified that there could be \nsituations in which NIS would have to pay to return a  railcar, but Mr. Dore also testified that he \nwas unaware of any such scenario ever occurring in NIS\u2019s case.  Tr. 48:2\u201349:18 (Hajas); Tr. 1466:25\u20131470:14 (Dore).  Ultimately, I find Mr. Gilbertson\u2019s testimony to be more persuasive, and I therefore conclude  that the cost to return a railcar should not be included in the potential \nliabilities associated with the SMBC and Mascoutin Heights contracts.  Accordingly, I have further modified Dr. Nantell\u2019s analysis below to disregard the estimated railcar return co sts. \n \n25  Applying a similar analysis, the defendants argue in their post -closing- argument letter \nbrief that the damages award should be $224,019.  Dkt. No. 273 at 7.  The reason for the discrepancy between that number and the damages award  is that the defe ndants deducted $2,500 \nin return costs for 254 rail cars, when in fact only 214 total rail cars were leased under the \nMascoutin and SMBC contracts.  Id.; PX009; PX010.  The  source of that error appears to be the \nplaintiffs\u2019 table in  Dkt. No. 269, at 57, in which the  plaintiffs appear to have made a typographical \n50 \n was a fair market pr ice, the purchased equity would have sold for $227,039 less had the defendants \ndisclosed  those five material contracts.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs are entitled to that amount in \nexpectation damages.  \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs are not entitl ed to damages associated with the class \nB units because the plaintiffs could have redeemed the class B units at the end of 2018 and received \nthe full value of those shares at that time.  By way of background, the class B units of NI Sand Holdings were subj ect to redemption by January 1, 2019; that is, the company could have forced \nthe owners of the class B shares to sell those shares back to the company at a specified price on that date.  R. Gilbertson Impeachment Exhs . at 113.  As part of the EPA, the plai ntiffs purchased \n$4,840,237.72 worth of class B units, PX001 at \u00a7 1.1(c) \u2013(g), and the total value to be paid to all \nthe class B shareholders in the event of a redemption was $7.2 million, Tr. 1523:7\u201314.  If it chose to redeem the shares, NIS would have had to pay the investors for their shares at that time.  \n At the end of 2018, however, NIS had only $63,712 in cash and cash equivalents on hand.  \nPX016.  Accordingly, NIS did not have nearly enough available funds to redeem the class B units at that time, reg ardless of whether the entirety of the class B shares or only the plaintiffs\u2019 class B \nshares were redeemed.  Mr. Hajas thus made the decision not to redeem the class B shares at the end of 2018.  Tr. 379:1\u20137.  I find that Mr. Hajas\u2019 s decision not to redeem  the class B shares was \nreasonable, and th us there was no failure by the plaintiffs to mitigate damages with respect to the \nclass B shares.  See VICI Racing, LLC v. T -Mobile USA, Inc., 763 F.3d 273, 300\u201301 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(noting that the determination of w hether a plaintiff failed to mitigate \u201c considers whether \nmitigation was feasible, what measures to limit damages were reasonable under the circumstances, \n \nerror.  The plaintiffs\u2019  calculations accurately reflect the costs to return 214 rail cars despite listing \n254 rail cars in their table.   See Dkt. No. 269 at 57\u201358.  51 \n and whether the plaintiff took sufficient measures to mitigate \u201d).  But even if the plaintiffs could \nhave redeemed the class B shares, their failure to do so would have had no effect on the damages \naward in this case because, as noted above, there are no damages that are attributable to the class \nB shares.  \n The plaintiffs also argue that they are entitled to punitive damages.  Punitive damages are \nnot recoverable on a breach of contract claim \u201cunless the conduct also amounts independently to a tort.\u201d  E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Pressman, 679 A.2d 436, 44 5 (Del. 1996)  (citing \nRestatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 355).  Because the plaintiffs have prevailed on only their breach of contract claim, and not their fraud claims, the defendants have not committed a tort that would entitle the plaintiffs to punitiv e damages.  In  any event, under Delaware law a defendant\u2019s \nconduct must be \u201c particularly egregious and rise [] to the level of willful, wanton or malicious \nconduct \u201d or be \u201coutrageous or particularly reprehensible\u201d in order to justify an award of punitive \ndamages.  Devaney v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 679 A.2d 71, 77 (Del. 1996) .  As noted, the \ndefendants did not act with scienter in making the misrepresentations that the plaintiffs allege, and their failure to list five material contracts on Schedule 2.15 of  the EPA is not the sort of outrageous \nconduct that would justify an award of punitive damages.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery will be limited to expectation damages.  \n Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the \ndamages award in this case.  Under Delaware law, \u201c[a]n obligation or written contract of several persons shall be joint and several, unless otherwise expressed.\u201d  6 Del. C. \u00a7 2701.  The face of the \nEPA does not appear to indicate an intent by the parties to alter that default rule, see  PX001, and \nthe defendants have not offered any reason to believe that they should not be jointly and severally 52 \n liable for the damages award.  Accordingly, I find that the defendants are jointly and severally \nliable for the $227,039 due to the plaintiffs. \nCONCLUSION \n In summary, I find that the defendants breached the EPA by failing to disclose five material \ncontracts (Chetek  Express , Mas coutin Heights , CIG, RJR, and SMBC) on Schedule 2.15 of the \nEPA .  The plaintiffs have not established that the defendants breached  the EPA by providing \ninaccurate financial statements with respect to NIS\u2019s inventory as of August 31 and September 30, 2018, by failing to disclose the Sioux Creek Silica contract , or by failing to properly account for \nemployee bonuses and certain accounts receivable .  The plaintiffs have also failed to establish that \nthe defendants acted with scienter for purposes of their comm on law fraud and securities fraud \nclaims.  \n More generally, while I find that the defendants breached the EPA in certain respects and \nthat the plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages commensurate with the scope of the breach, I \nfind that the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence does not support their general theory of this case \u2014that the loss \nof their entire investment in NIS was attributable to fraud and wholesale contract breaches by the defendants.  The losses suffered by the plaintiffs on their investment were largely attributable to \nthe collapse of the market for northern white frac sand, a circumstance unanticipated by any of the \nparties and certainly not caused by the defendants. \nAs a result of the defendants\u2019 failure to disclose five material contracts to the plain tiffs, the \nplaintiffs are entitled to recover $ 227,039 from the defendants.  Within seven days of the issuance \nof this order, the parties should docket a proposed form of judgment  that includes an allocation of \nthe recovery between APEX and Gopher .  If the  parties cannot agree regarding any aspect of the 53 \n form of judgment, they should each submit a proposed form of judgment and a brief explaining \ntheir position as to how the judgment should be framed.   \nIn accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) and Local Rule 54.1, the parties \nmay move for costs and attorney\u2019 s fees within 14 days of the entry of judgment.  Any motion for \ncosts or fees should include a discussion of whether and to what extent the moving party is the \nprevailing part y, and how the court should proceed if it concludes that both parties prevailed in \npart or that there is no prevailing party.  Any brief in support of a motion for costs and/or fees will \nbe limited to 20 pages in length.  As part of the judgment, the court  will enter an order pursuant to \nRule 58(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure providing that if either or both sides make a timely motion for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54(d)(2), the motion or motions will have the same effect under Federal Rule of A ppellate Procedure 4(a)(4) as a timely motion under Rule 59;  that \nis, that the time to file an appeal will run for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last of such motions.
