(D.I. 86) The Court has reviewed the complaint \n(D .I. 1-1 ), the notice of removal (D .I. 1 ), and the parties' briefs, exhibits, declarations , and \nnotices of supplemental authority (see, e.g., D.I. 89, 96-99, 101, 104, 107, 108, 113, 119). The \nCourt also heard argument via teleconference on May 19, 2021. (D.I. 111) (\"Tr.\") For the \nreasons set forth below, the Court will grant Plaintiffs motion.1 \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn September 10, 2020, Plaintiff filed suit in the Delaware Superior Court against \nnumerous major corporations having operations in the fossil fuel industry (collectively , \n\"Defendants\"). Plaintiffs complaint asserts solely state-law claims, specifically for: \n(1) negligent failure to warn, (2) trespass, (3) nuisance, and (4) violations of the Delaware \nConsumer Fraud Act.2 (D.I. 1-1 ,r,r 234-80) Plaintiff's claims are based on an alleged \n1 In their initial briefing, Defendants suggested that cases then pending before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt might address issues relating to federal jurisdiction and the same type of claims asserted \nhere. (See D.I. 96 at 6-7) Defendants did not formally request a stay, although they observed \nthat \"awaiting guidance from the Supreme Court on the issues raised in Plaintiff's Motion may \nfurther the interests of judicial economy and efficiency .\" (D.I. 96 at 7) Thereafter, on May 17, \n2021, the Supreme Court issued its ruling in BP P.L. C. v. Mayor of Baltimore , 141 S. Ct. 1532 \n(2021) (\"Baltimore III\"). The Baltimore 111 decision, however, only addresses the scope of \nappellate review and does not reach the merits of any dispute over federal jurisdiction. During \noral argument in the instant case, Defendants suggested that the Court delay its decision until \nafter the Supreme Court rendered its ruling on the petition for a writ of certiorari in the appeal \nfrom the Ninth Circuit's decision in City of Oakland v. BP P.L.C., 960 F.3d 570 (9th Cir. 2020), \nmodified by 969 F.3d 895. (See Tr. at 88-89) The Supreme Court subsequently denied that \npetition on June 14, 2021. See Chevron Corp. v. City of Oakland, 141 S. Ct. 2776 (2021). No \nparty has suggested there is any reason for further delay in resolving Plaintiff's motion. \n2 The negligent failure to warn, trespass, and nuisance claims are brought against the \"Fossil Fuel \nDefendants,\" which includes the BP entities (BP P.L.C. and BP America Inc.), the Chevron \nentities (Chevron Corporation and Chevron USA, Inc.), the ConocoPhillips entities \n(ConocoPhillips , ConocoPhillips Company , Phillips 66, and Phillips 66 Company) , the Exxon \n1 disinformation campaign undertaken by Defendants , purportedly to mislead the public and \nconsumers by misrepresenting the devastating impacts of climate change and its link to fossil \nfuels -ultimately leading to disastrous climate impacts on the State of Delaware , as the result of \nincreased extraction , production , and consumption of fossil fuels. (See id. ,r,r 1-12)3 \nAccording to Plaintiff, Defendants have known for more than 50 years that their fossil \nfuel products create greenhouse gas pollution having significant adverse impacts on the climate \nand sea levels. (See id. ,r,r 1, 7, 62-103) Instead of disclosing the known harms associated with \ntheir products, Defendants embarked on a campaign of denial and disinformation about the \nexistence , cause, and adverse effects of global warming, which was designed to protect and \nexpand the consumption of their fossil fuel products. (See id. ,r,r 104-60) As the scientific \nconsensus about the causes and consequences of climate change has strengthened , Defendants \ncontinued to mislead the public by advertising that certain fossil fuel products are \"green\" or \nentities (Exxon Mobil Corporation , ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, XTO Energy Inc.), Hess \nCorporation, the Marathon entities (Marathon Oil Corporation , Marathon Oil Company , \nMarathon Petroleum Corporation , Marathon Petroleum Company LP, and Speedway LLC), the \nMurphy Oil entities (Murphy Oil Corporation and Murphy USA, Inc.), the Shell entities (Royal \nDutch Shell PLC and Shell Oil Company), Citgo Petroleum Corporation, the Total entities (Total \nS.A. and TotalEnergies Marketing USA, Inc.), Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Devon Energy \nCorporation, Apache Corporation , the CONSOL entities (CNX Resources Corporation and \nCONSOL Energy Inc.), and Ovintiv, Inc. (See D.I. 1-1 ,r 36) The claim for violation of the \nDelaware Consumer Fraud Act (\"CF A\") is brought against Defendant American Petroleum \nInstitute and some, but not all, of the Fossil Fuel Defendants (including the BP entities, the \nChevron entities, the Exxon entities, Hess Corporation , the Shell entities, Citgo Petroleum \nCorporation, CNX Resources Corporation , and the Marathon entities) (this subgroup of \nDefendants hereinafter referred to as the \"CF A Defendants \"). (See id. ,r 265) \n3 The Court understands Plaintiffs theory to be, in part, that Defendants ' misrepresentations and \ndeception caused increased consumption of fossil fuels all around the world, leading to injurious \nenvironmental impacts in Delaware , impacts for which Plaintiff seeks to recover damages \n(among other potential relief). (See D.I. 1-1 ,r,r 7-11; see also Tr. at 93 (\"[T]he only source of \nliability is the misrepresentation ... and the damages are restricted to the impact in Delaware.\") ) \n2 \"clean,\" and falsely portraying themselves as environmentally conscious companies that invest \nheavily in renewable energy sources. (See id. 11 161-210) \nPlaintiff alleges it has suffered, and will foreseeably continue to suffer, damages from the \nclimate impacts purportedly caused by Defendants' disinformation campaign, including \naccelerating sea level rise, increased extreme weather events, ocean acidification, and elevated \naverage air temperature. (See id. 11226-30) Plaintiff further contends it has incurred, and will \ncontinue to incur, expenses to preemptively mitigate the injuries caused by Defendants' \nmisconduct. (See id. 1 231) Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, penalties under the \nDelaware Consumer Fraud Act, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees and costs.4 (See id. at \n21 7) (Prayer for Relief) \nOn October 23, 2020, Defendants removed this action from the Delaware Superior Court \nto this Court, citing seven grounds for federal jurisdiction: (1) federal common law, (2) Grable \njurisdiction, (3) complete preemption by the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"), (4) federal enclave \njurisdiction, (5) the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442, (6) jurisdiction under the \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act (\"OCSLA\"), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, et seq., and (7) the Class \nAction Fairness Act (\"CAFA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. (See D.I. 1) \n4 The Prayer for Relief in Plaintiffs complaint does not seek an injunction against Defendants' \noil production, marketing, and sales activities. However, in stating the common-law nuisance \nclaim, the complaint does indicate that Plaintiff \"seeks an order that ... enjoins Fossil Fuel \nDefendants from creating future common-law nuisance.\" (D.I. 1-11263) During oral argument, \nPlaintiff insisted it is \"in no way directly asking a court to limit, modify, alter, cease, [or] in any \nway hinder the actual exploration, production, sale, [and] consumption of fossil fuels,\" adding \nthat \"any injunctive relief' would instead \"focus on the veracity of marketing and other public \ncommunications.\" (Tr. at 27-29) Plaintiff then further clarified it would not \"be looking for \nprospective injunctive relief against speech of any kind,\" adding that Defendants \"can continue \nto market, but they may be subject to liability in Delaware for continued false and deceptive \nconduct.\" (Id. at 93-94, 103) The Court, thus, understands that Plaintiff seeks no injunctive \nrelief \"directed at [D]efendants' forward-looking activities in any way.\" (Id. at 29) \n3 Plaintiff filed the pending motion on November 20, 2020, seeking remand of the instant \naction back to the Delaware Superior Court. (D.I. 86) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nFederal courts are \"courts of limited jurisdiction \" and \"possess only that power \nauthorized by Constitution and statute.\" Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. \n546, 552 (2005). A defendant may remove a civil action from a state court to a federal district \ncourt if the federal district court would have original jurisdiction of the action. See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1441 ( a). However, \"[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court \nlacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded\" to state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). \n\"The removing party carries a heavy burden of showing that at all stages of the litigation \nthe case is properly before the federal court. Removal statutes are to be strictly construed, with \nall doubts to be resolved in favor ofremand. \"5 Manning v. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & \nSmith, Inc., 772 F.3d 158, 162 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal citation omitted). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nIn the notice of removal, Defendants asserted seven grounds for removal. (D.I. 1) After \nPlaintiff challenged each of these grounds (see generally D.I. 89), Defendants effectively \nabandoned their contentions with respect to complete preemption by the CAA, federal enclave \njurisdiction, and CAF A. 6 Hence, the Court needs to address only the four remaining grounds: \n5 Defendants assert that the principle of \"all doubts to be resolved in favor of remand\" is no \nlonger viable after the Supreme Court's Baltimore III ruling. (Tr. at 71-72) The Court disagrees. \nBaltimore III neither expressly addresses nor implicitly undermines this principle. \n6 In their briefing, Defendants only mention CAF A once in passing, and address complete \npreemption and federal enclave jurisdiction only in one footnote each. (See D.I. 96 at 6, 19 n.7, \n51 n.12) These grounds for removal are, as a result, waived. See John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. \nCIGNA Int'! Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"[A]rguments raised in passing \n(such as, in a footnote) , but not squarely argued, are considered waived.\"); Peters v. Ryan, 2017 \n4 (1) federal common law, (2) Grable jurisdiction , (3) the federal officer removal statute, and \n( 4) jurisdiction under the OCSLA. Defendants have failed to meet their burden to show that this \nCourt may exercise jurisdiction over this case on any of these four grounds. Thus, the Court will \ngrant Plaintiff's motion and remand this case to the Delaware Superior Court. \nA. Federal Common Law \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs state-law claims \"necessarily arise under federal \ncommon law\" because the issues presented in these claims \"are exclusively federal in nature.\" \n(D.I. 1 at 23; D.I. 96 at 16) According to Defendants , since Plaintiffs claims \"seek to regulate \ntrans boundary and international emissions and pollution ,\" they fall under one of the specialized \nareas of overriding federal interest. (D .I. 96 at 16) Additionally, since Plaintiff's claims \"seek to \nregulate the production and sale of oil and gas abroad,\" they implicate the \"federal government's \nforeign affairs power.\" (Id. at 18) \nPlaintiff counters that federal common law cannot provide an independent basis for \nremoval because Plaintiffs complaint asserts exclusively state-law claims; any exceptions to the \nwell-pleaded complaint rule are not satisfied in this case. (D.I. 89 at 8; D.I. 101 at 3) Plaintiff \nalso insists that its claims do not implicate federal common law, as they seek neither to address \ncross-border pollution nor to regulate international fossil fuel production and sales. (D.I. 89 at \n10; D.I. 101 at 7) \nWL 1393692, at *2 (D. Del. Apr. 13, 2017) (\"When a party files an opposition brief and fails to \ncontest an issue raised in the opening brief, the issue is considered waived or abandoned by the \nnon-movant.\"). During oral argument , Defendants confirmed that they have \"narrowed things \ndown\" to the four grounds that the Court addresses , adding that federal enclave jurisdiction is \n\"subsumed within\" other bases for removal. (See Tr. at 65) \n5 The Court agrees with Plaintiff that federal common law cannot create federal \njurisdiction to support removal here, irrespective of whether Plaintiffs claims are \"federal in \nnature.\"7 \nFederal district courts have \"original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the \nConstitution , laws, or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The \"presence or \nabsence of federal question jurisdiction is governed by the 'well-pleaded complaint rule,' which \nprovides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of \nthe plaintiffs properly pleaded complaint. \" Rivet v. Regions Bank of La., 522 U.S. 470, 475 \n(1998) (internal citation omitted). \"[ A] case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of \na federal defense, including the defense of preemption, ... even if the defense is the only \nquestion truly at issue in the case.\" Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Tr. for S. \nCal., 463 U.S. 1, 14 (1983). Hence, a plaintiff may \"avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive \nreliance on state law.\" Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987). Nevertheless , a \ncourt may uphold removal \"where federal law completely preempts an asserted state-law claim.\" \nRivet, 522 U.S. at 471 (emphasis added). Federal law completely preempts state law \"[o]nly if \nCongress intended [for the federal law] to provide the exclusive cause of action\" asserted in the \nclaim. Beneficial Nat'! Bankv. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 9 (2003). \nPlaintiff's claims are not completel y preempted by federal common law. Defendants do \nnot dispute, nor can they, that Plaintiff's complaint , on its face, only asserts state-law causes of \naction. The complaint makes no attempt to state any claims arising under federal common law. \n7 Having found that federal common law cannot create a basis for removal, the Court need not \nreach the question of whether federal common law has been displaced by the Clean Air Act, as \nPlaintiff contends. (See D.I. 89 at 11; D.I. 96 at 21-22) If Plaintiff is correct, this would provide \nyet another basis to reject Defendants ' assertion of federal common law as a ground to deny \nremand. \n6 Nor is there any indication that Congress has intended for federal common law to provide the \nexclusive cause of action for the claims asserted in the complaint. See Beneficial Nat 'l Bank, \n539 U.S. at 9. In apparent recognition of the futility of this theory, Defendants have expressly \nabandoned the preemption ground, noting that their federal common law analysis \"does not \nimplicate preemption principles or standards.\" (D.I. 1 , 14) \nUnable to establish complete preemption , Defendants turn to argue that Plaintiffs claims \nhave an \"inherently federal nature.\" (D.I. 96 at 18) This contention , too, is unpersuasi ve. In the \nCourt's view, Defendants ' repeated refrains that federal common law \"governs\" or \"exclusively \ngoverns\" the issues underlying Plaintiff's state-la w claims are simply veiled- and non\u00ad\nmeritorious , for purposes of removal -preemption arguments . (See, e.g., id. at 16) (referring to \n\"specialized areas 'where there is an overriding federal interest in the need for a uniform rule of \ndecision'\") (quoting fllinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U.S. 91, 105 n.6 (1972) (\"Milwaukee I\")) \nOrdinary preemption, however, does not provide a basis for establishing federal jurisdiction. See \nMetro. Edison Co. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm 'n, 767 F.3d 335, 362 (3d Cir. 2014) (finding that \n\"preemption arguments , other than complete preemption , relate to the merits of the case\" and \"do \nnot ordinarily raise issues of subject matter jurisdiction \"). \nNeither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit has held that a complaint expressly \nasserting state-law claims that happen to implicate federal common law can create an additional \nexception to the well-pleaded complaint rule and confer removal jurisdiction on federal courts. \nSee Oakland, 969 F.3d at 908 (reversing district court's finding that plaintiffs nuisance claims \nare removable on ground that such claims are governed by federal common law). The cases \ncited by Defendants for this supposed proposition are inapposite , as they either involve plaintiffs \nexpressly pleading federal common law causes of action, see Am. Elec. Power Co. v. \n7 Connecticut , 564 U.S. 410,418,421 (2011); Nat'l Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe of \nIndians, 471 U.S. 845, 848-50 (1985); City of Milwaukee v. Illinois (\"Milwaukee II\"), 451 U.S. \n304,310 (1981); Treiber & Straub, Inc. v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 474 F.3d 379,383 (7th Cir. \n2007), or involve federal courts exercising subject matter jurisdiction on grounds independent of \nfederal questions, see Milwaukee I, 406 U.S. at 93 (proceeding by state plaintiff under Supreme \nCourt's original jurisdiction pursuant to U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 2); Banco Nacional de Cuba \nv. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398,406 (1964) (common law conversion claim brought by foreign \ngovernment in federal district court); United States v. Standard Oil Co., 332 U.S. 301, 302 \n(1947) (claims brought by United States in federal district court).8 None of these cases supports \nthe proposition that, in the context of removal, purportedly controlling federal common law \nissues -that are not pleaded on the face of a complaint -create the grounds for federal \n8 This category of cases also includes the New York case cited by Defendants as supplemental \nauthority (D.I. 104), as that case was filed in federal district court in the first instance based on \ndiversity jurisdiction. See City of New Yorkv. BP PLC, 325 F. Supp. 3d 466 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), \naff'd, 993 F.3d 81, 94 (2d Cir. 2021) (\"Here, the City filed suit in federal court in the first \ninstance. We are thus free to consider the Producers ' preemption defense on its own terms, not \nunder the heightened standard unique to the removability inquiry.\"). \nDefendants also cite United States v. Swiss Am. Bank, Ltd., 191 F.3d 30, 45 (1st Cir. \n1999), for the proposition that a case is one \"arising under\" federal law \"[a]s long as the source \nof the rule to be applied is federal.\" (See D.I. 96 at 21-22) Swiss Am. Bank, however, concerns a \n\"claim that arises under federal law\" for purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction over a \nforeign defendant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2), and does not hold that a claim \nto which federal law applies as the source of the rule also confers original subject matter \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. \n8 jurisdiction.9 Hence, existing law governing federal question jurisdiction does not support \nDefendants' reliance on federal common law to establish removal jurisdiction in this case.10 \nDefendants' reliance on the \"artful pleading\" doctrine fares no better. The Court rejects \nDefendants' contention that this doctrine \"is not necessarily linked to [the] complete preemption \ndoctrine.\" (Tr. at 75; see also D.l. 96 at 20) Under Third Circuit law, the \"artful pleading\" \ndoctrine is synonymous with the \"complete preemption \" doctrine for purposes of establishing \nfederal jurisdiction , supporting removal only where there is \"a clear indication of a \nCongressional intention to permit removal despite the plaintiffs exclusive reliance on state law.\" \nGoepel v. Nat'! Postal Mail Handlers Union, 36 F.3d 306,310 n.5, 311 (3d Cir. 1994) (holding \nthat \"complete preemption\" doctrine \"has been referred to elsewhere as the 'artful pleading' \ndoctrine\"); see also Inselberg v. New York Football Giants, Inc., 661 F. App'x 776, 779 (3d Cir. \n2016) (same). Thus, absent a finding of complete preemption of Plaintiffs state-law claims -\nand Defendants disclaim any intent to show such complete preemption (see D.I. 1 , 14)-the \n9 In their notice of removal ( although not in their briefs), Defendants cite a single case in which \nfederal common law was relied on as an independent basis for conferring federal jurisdiction: \nSam L. Majors Jewelers v. ABX, Inc., 117 F.3d 922, 928-29 (5th Cir. 1997). In Sam L. Majors, \nthe Fifth Circuit held that a state-law negligence claim arose under federal common law and, \nthus, gave rise to federal jurisdiction. In reaching that conclusion, the Fifth Circuit relied \nprimarily on Milwaukee I and Nat'! Farmers Union. Neither of these two cases, however, \ninvolved removal on the basis of federal common law. Further, the reasoning of Sam L. Majors \non this issue has been criticized by a number of courts. See, e.g., Connecticut v. Exxon Mobil \nCorp., 2021 WL 2389739, at *4 (D. Conn. June 2, 2021); Sekata v. FedEx, 2020 WL 6546211, at \n*4-5 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 6, 2020); Bd. of Cty. Comm 'rs of Boulder Cty. v. Suncor Energy (US.A.) \nInc. (\"Boulder I\"), 405 F. Supp. 3d 947, 963 (D. Colo. 2019); Signer v. DHL Worldwide Exp., \nInc., 2007 WL 1521497, at *5-6 (S.D. Fla. May 22, 2007). This Court, too, finds the reasoning \nof Sam L. Majors unpersuasive. \n10 Defendants' argument that \"Section 13 31 's 'grant of jurisdiction will support claims founded \nupon federal common law as well as those of a statutory origin,\"' while correct, is not \ndispositive , because Plaintiff has not asserted on the face of its complaint any \"claims founded \nupon federal common law.\" (D.I. 96 at 19) (quoting Nat'! Farmers Union, 471 U.S. at 850) \n9 \"artful pleading\" doctrine does not provide an independent basis for removal, regardless of \nwhether federal common law provides the rule of decision on the merits of Plaintiffs state-law \nclaims. None of Defendants ' cited cases holds otherwise.11 \nIn sum, Plaintiff only asserts state-law claims in its complaint, and Defendants fail to \nshow complete preemption. Therefore, Plaintiffs claims do not arise under federal law for \njurisdiction purposes. Federal common law, even if (as Defendants insist) implicated in \nPlaintiffs state-law claims, does not provide a proper basis for removing this case. See Oakland, \n969 F.3d at 908; City of Hoboken v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 2021 WL 4077541, at *5-6 (D.N.J. \nSept. 8, 2021); Connecticut , 2021 WL 2389739, at *7; Minnesota v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 2021 \nWL 1215656, at *6 (D. Minn. Mar. 31, 2021); Boulder I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 964; Rhode Islandv. \nChevron Corp. (\"Rhode Island I\"), 393 F. Supp. 3d 142, 150 (D.R.I. 2019); Mayor of Baltimore \nv. BP P.L.C. (\"Baltimore I\"), 388 F. Supp. 3d 538, 558 (D. Md. 2019); Cty. of San Mateo v. \nChevron Corp. (\"San Mateo I\"), 294 F. Supp. 3d 934, 938 (N.D. Cal. 2018). Therefore , the \nCourt will turn to consideration of the other grounds asserted by Defendants as the basis for \nfederal removal jurisdiction. \n11 Jarbough v. Att'y Gen. of the United States, 483 F.3d 184 (3d Cir. 2007), Interfaith Cmty. Org. \nv. Honeywell Int 'l, Inc., 426 F .3d 694 (3d Cir. 2005), and First Pa. Bank, NA. v. E. Airlines, \nInc., 731 F .2d 1113 (3d Cir. 1984), are all inapposite , as they were filed and adjudicated in \nfederal court and say nothing about the removability of state-law claims or subject matter \njurisdiction. In Federated Dep 't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 397 n.2 (1981), the \nSupreme Court stated in a footnote: \"[t]he Court of Appeals also affirmed the District Court's \nconclusion that Brown II was properly removed to federal court, reasoning that the claims \npresented were 'federal in nature.' We agree that at least some of the claims had a sufficient \nfederal character to support removal.\" In a subsequent case, the Supreme Court clarified that \nMoitie's \"enigmatic footnote\" does not create removal jurisdiction on the basis of a federal \ndefense. Rivet, 522 U.S. at 477-78 (\"We therefore clarify today that Moitie did not create a \npreclusion exception to the rule, fundamental under currently governing legislation, that a \ndefendant cannot remove on the basis of a federal defense.\"). \n10 B. Grable Jurisdiction \nFederal jurisdiction exists in a \"special and small category\" of cases even when a party's \nclaim \"finds its origins in state rather than federal law.\" Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 258 \n(2013). Pursuant to what is commonly referred to as \"Grable jurisdiction ,\" \"federal jurisdiction \nover a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is: ( 1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, \n(3) substantial, and (4) capable ofresolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state \nbalance approved by Congress.\" Id at 258; see also Grable & Sons Metal Prods. v. Darue \nEng'g & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308, 314-15 (2005). Defendants proffer numerous theories for why \nremoval is proper here on the basis of Grable jurisdiction , all of which rely on Defendants ' \ncontention that Plaintiff's claims \"necessarily involve inherently federal issues.\" (D.I. 96 at 22) \nIn the Court's view, however, no federal issue is \"necessarily raised\" by this litigation. \nAccordingl y, each of Defendants' efforts to invoke Grable jurisdiction fails. \nMost broadly, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs claims attempt to \"supplant federal \nenergy policy, exercise the federal foreign affairs power, and regulate Defendants' speech over \nmatters of public concern.\" (Id) The Court disagrees with Defendants' characterization of \nPlaintiffs claims. Instead, Plaintiffs claims do not \"necessarily raise\" any question of federal \nlaw. (See D.I. 89 at 13; D.I. 101 at 14) The federal interest issues cited by Defendants do not \nprovide \"an essential element\" for any of Plaintiff's claims; nor does the vindication of rights \nasserted in Plaintiffs claims '\"necessarily tumO on some construction of federal law.\"' \nManning, 772 F.3d at 163 (quoting Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 9). \nMore specifically, Defendants first argue that Grable jurisdiction exists because \nPlaintiffs claims seek to \"strike a new regulatory balance that would supplant decades of \nnational energy, economic , and environmental policies on these issues,\" and, thus, \"cannot be \n11 reconciled with the decision-making scheme Congress enacted.\" (DJ. 96 at 23) These \nstatements are not consistent with a fair reading of Plaintiff's claims. Instead, the claims asserted \nby Plaintiff are based on Defendants ' alleged disinformation campaign -which purportedl y led \nto increased extraction , production , and consumption of petroleum products, without warning to \nconsumers and the public of the risks known to Defendants (see D.I. 1-1 ,r,r 1-12)-and \nPlaintiff's claims seek only relief directed at recovering damages resulting from that alleged \ndisinformation campaign.12 In other words, rather than (as Defendants , incorrectl y, contend) \n\"inviting a Delaware state court to assert control over an entire industry and its interstate (indeed, \ninternational) commercial activities\" (D.I. 96 at 23), Plaintiff's claims in reality \"do(] not \nchallenge or seek to overturn any federal law, rule, or program,\" \"do(] not claim that Defendants \nare liable for violating any federal law,\" and \"neither directly nor indirectly seek[] any relief \nfrom any federal agency.\" (D.I. 89 at 15) Whether the indirect, non-judicially-imposed \nconsequences of remediating the disinformat ion campaign (if, and only if, proven) would lead to \nchanges in \"energy, economic , and environmental policies\" is not a matter with which the Court \ncan be concerned. See generally Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 700 (2013) (holding that \nfederal courts have authority to answer questions \"only if necessary to do so in the course of \ndeciding an actual 'case' or 'controversy\"'). Federal jurisdiction is not created by predictions \nabout extra-judicial realities that may ( or may not) result from a state court resolving a claim that \nraises solely matters of state law. \n12 Plaintiff clarified during oral argument that the injuries alleged in the complaint are limited to \nthe \"incremental impact\" resulting from Defendant s' \"wrongful and tortious promotion and \nmarketing.\" (Tr. at 24-26) \n12 Defendants ' next effort to invoke Grable jurisdiction rests on the theory that Plaintiffs \nclaims seek to \"regulate global climate change, which is an inherently federal matter that is the \nsubject of major international treaties.\" (D.I. 96 at 24) Contrary to Defendants ' assertion, \nhowever, nothing in Plaintiffs complaint shows that Plaintiff \"seeks to replace these \ninternational negotiations and decisions from the representative branches of government with a \nstate-law solution.\" (Id at 25) Defendants cite generally to international agreements on climate \nchange, including the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015, but fail to \nidentify any \"essential element\" in Plaintiffs claims that would require a court to affirmativel y \nanswer any foreign affairs question. See Manning , 772 F.3d at 163. Hence, no federal question \nconcerning foreign affairs is \"necessaril y raised.\"13 \nNor does Defendants' assertion that they may be subject to both state and federal \nregulatory and enforcement regimes (see D.I. 96 at 23-24) bring this case within the \"slim \ncategory\" of Grable jurisdiction. As the Northern District of California stated in rejecting this \nsame position, \"[ o ]n the defendants ' theory, many (if not all) state tort claims that involve the \n13 See Oakland, 969 F.3d at 906-07 (rejecting Grable jurisdiction , which had been argued to be \nbased on theory \"that the Cities' state-law claim implicates a variety of 'federal interests,' \nincluding ... foreign policy\"); Minnesota, 2021 WL 1215656, at * 5 (\"The Court declines \nDefendants ' invitation to interpret this well-pleaded consumer protection action as a wholesale \nattack on all features of global fossil fuel extraction , production , and policy.\"); Boulder I, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d at 966 (\"Certainly Defendants have not shown that any interpretation of foreign policy \nis an essential element of Plaintiffs ' claims.\"); Rhode Island I, 393 F. Supp. 3d at 151 (\"By \nmentioning foreign affairs, ... Defendants seek to raise issues ... that are not perforce presented \nby the State's claims.\"); Baltimore I, 388 F. Supp. 3d at 559 (\"[D]efendants' generalized \nreferences to foreign policy wholly fail to demonstrate that a federal question is 'essential to \nresolving ' the City's state law claims. \"); San Mateo I, 294 F. Supp. 3d at 938 (\"The mere \npotential for foreign policy implications ... does not raise the kind of actually disputed, \nsubstantial federal issue necessary for Grable jurisdiction. \"). \n13 balancing of interests and are brought against federally regulated entities would be removable. \nGrable does not sweep so broadly.\" San Mateo I, 294 F. Supp. 3d at 938. \nFinally, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs claims would \"necessarily incorporate \naffirmative federal constitutional elements imposed by the First Amendment.\" (D.I. 96 at 26) \nThe Court is not persuaded. While the cases cited by Defendants address the constitutional \nboundaries for the remedies available under state-law defamation and libel claims, they do not \nhold that the Constitution supplies a necessary element for these state-law claims. See Milkovich \nv. Lorain J Co., 497 U.S. 1, 20 (1990) (holding that statement of \"opinion\" reasonably implying \nfalse and defamatory facts is subject to same culpability requirements as statement of facts); \nHustler Magazine , Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 52 (1988) (holding that public figures may not \nrecover for intentional infliction of emotional distress by reason of publication without showing \nboth falsity and actual malice); Phi/a. Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 774-75 (1986) \n(holding that private figure plaintiff alleging defamation must prove falsity in cases involving \nmedia defendant's speech on matters of public concern); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 \nU.S. 254, 279-80 (1964) (holding that public figures may recover for defamation only when they \ncan prove both falsity of statement and that statement was made with actual malice). Defendants \ncite no authority for the proposition that the First Amendment -through Grable jurisdiction -\nconverts state law causes of action involving speech into federal causes of action for purposes of \nassessing jurisdiction.14 To the contrary, the Third Circuit has repeatedly found that defamation \nclaims, despite having \"profound First Amendment implications,\" are still \"fundamentally a state \n14 The only case Defendants cite that was found removable based on Grable jurisdiction involves \na complaint that \"expressly states that [the defendant] violated the United States Constitution in \ndescribing [the plaintiffs state-law wrongful termination] claims.\" Ortiz v.

Fischbein , 237 F.3d 275,281 (3d Cir. 2001) (internal citation \nomitted); see also Manning , 772 F.3d at 164 (\"[E]ven if Plaintiffs ' claims were partially \npredicated on federal law, federal law would still not be necessarily raised.\").15 \nMany of the decisions Defendants cite in support of their attempts to invoke Grable \njurisdiction were litigated to judgment in state courts, and then subsequently reviewed by the \nSupreme Court.16 (See D.I. 101 at 20) State and local governments routinely litigate nuisance \nand similar claims that purportedly \"target speech on matters of public concern\" -and do so in \nstate court.17 (See id at 19) It follows that, while Plaintiffs claims may implicate First \nAmendment considerations , they do not \"necessaril y raise\" a federal issue. See generally MHA \nLLC v. HealthFirst , Inc., 629 F. App'x 409,413 (3d Cir. 2015) (\"The fact that federal law may \nbe informative ... does not mean that federal law is a necessary component of the cause of \naction.\"); see also Hoboken , 2021 WL 4077541 , at *7-8 (rejecting argument that First \n15 Defendants contended during oral argument that Plaintiff was \"seeking to get a prior restraint \nor to regulate speech.\" (Tr. at 47) In response, Plaintiff clarified that \"a global prior restraint \norder injunction ... is just not part of this case.\" (Id at 93) Plaintiff confirmed that it would not \n\"be looking for prospective injunctive relief against speech of any kind,\" and that Defendants \n\"can continue to market, but they may be subject to liability in Delaware for continued false and \ndeceptive conduct.\" (Id at 93-94, 103) \n16 See Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 6-7 (Ohio); Hepps, 475 U.S. at 770 (Pennsylvania); New York \nTimes, 376 U.S. at 256 (Alabama) . \n17 See, e.g., Delaware ex rel. Denn v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 2018 WL 1942363, at *1 (D. Del. \nApr. 25, 2018) (remanding Delaware 's case to state court where Delaware alleged, in part, that \ndefendants \"misrepresented material facts or suppressed, concealed, or omitted material facts\" \nconcerning their products and compliance with federal drug laws); State v. Purdue Pharma LP, \n2019 WL 4019929, at *12 (Okla. Dist. Ct. Aug. 26, 2019) (awarding $572 millionjudgment in \nnuisance trial where \"challenged conduct\" was \"misleading marketing and promotion of \nopioids,\" contributing to statewide opioid crisis); Cty. of Santa Clara v. At!. Richfield Co., 40 \nCal. Rptr. 3d 313,330 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006) (reversing dismissal of public nuisance claim \nalleging that defendants misled consumers and public about dangers of indoor lead paint). \n15 Amendment created Grable jurisdiction for state-law claims); Connecticut, 2021 WL 2389739, \nat *10 (same). \nAs Defendants have failed to demonstrate that a federal issue is \"necessarily raised\" by \nPlaintiff's claims, Defendants have likewise failed to show that the Court may exercise Grable \njurisdiction. The Court need not additionally evaluate whether Defendants can meet any of the \nother three requirements for invoking Grable jurisdiction. \nC. Federal Officer Removal Statute \nThe federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a), is \"an exception to the 'well\u00ad\npleaded complaint' rule.\" Kircher v. Putnam Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633,644 n.12 (2006). The \nstatute permits removal when four elements are met: \"(1) the defendant is a 'person' within the \nmeaning of the statute; (2) the plaintiff's claims are based upon the defendant's conduct 'acting \nunder' the United States, its agencies, or its officers; (3) the plaintiff's claims against the \ndefendant are 'for, or relating to' an act under color of federal office; and (4) the defendant raises \na colorable federal defense to the plaintiff's claims.\" Papp v. Fore-Kast Sales Co., 842 F.3d 805, \n812 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citation omitted). \"Unlike the general removal statute, the federal \nofficer removal statute is to be broadly construed in favor of a federal forum.\" In re \nCommonwealth 's Motion to Appoint Couns. Against or Directed to Defender Ass 'n of Phi/a., 790 \nF.3d 457, 466-67 (3d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nDefendants identify a number of activities they contend satisfy the four elements of the \nfederal officer removal statute. They are: (1) securing and expanding fuel supplies during the \ntwo World Wars and the Korean War (D.I. 1 1152-57) ; (2) developing mineral resources on the \nouter continental shelf (\"OCS\") (id. 11 59-62, 68-89); (3) operating the Elk Hills Reserve (id. \n1190-107); (4) supplying and managing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (id. 11108-13); and \n16 (5) producing specialized fuels for the military (id. ,r,r 114-37). Plaintiff does not challenge that \nDefendants are \"person[s]\" within the meaning of the statute and only addresses Defendants' \ncolorable federal defenses in passing. (D.I. 89 at 26 n.10) Plaintiff, however, contends that \n(1) its claims do not rest on activities \"for, or relating to\" an act under color of federal office, and \nthat (2) Defendants are not \"acting under\" federal officers. The Court addresses each of these \ntwo issues, both of which Defendants must prevail on to establish federal officer removal \njurisdiction . \n1. Whether Plaintiff's Claims Concern Acts \"For, Or Relating To\" An \nAct Under Color Of Federal Office \nIn the Third Circuit, in order to meet the \"for, or relating to\" requirement, \"it is sufficient \nfor there to be a 'connection ' or 'association ' between the act in question and the federal \noffice.\"18 Defender Ass 'n, 790 F.3d at 471. \nPlaintiff points out that several activities Defendants rely on in their effort to show a \nconnection or association between activities and federal office -including the operation of \npetroleum reserves and the sales of \"specialized petroleum products\" to the U.S. military - are \nirrelevant to the analysis because Plaintiff has, in its complaint, expressly disclaimed any \n\"injuries arising on federal property and those that arose from Defendants ' provision of fossil \nfuel products to the federal government. \" (D.I. 89 at 26; see also D.I. 1-1 ,r 14) Defendants \nrespond that Plaintiff's disclaimer is ineffective because \"such 'attempts at artful pleading to \n18 The removal statute was amended in 2011 to include the phrase \"or relating to.\" The Third \nCircuit has found this new language \"broaden[ ed] the universe of acts that enable Federal \nofficers to remove to Federal court.\" Defender Ass 'n, 790 F.3d at 467. A defendant is no longer \nrequired to \"show a nexus, a causal connection between the charged conduct and asserted official \nauthority,\" Jefferson County v. Acker, 527 U.S. 423, 431 (1999) (internal citation and quotation \nmarks omitted), as had previously been understood to be required, see Defender Ass 'n, 790 F.3d \nat 471-72. \n17 circumvent federal officer removal by the use of jurisdictional disclaimers have generally \nfailed.\"' (D.I. 96 at 56-59) (quoting Dougherty v. AO Smith Corp., 2014 WL 3542243, at *5 (D. \nDel. July 16, 2014)) Defendants' reliance on this Court's decision in Dougherty is misplaced. \nPlaintiffs disclaimer here is not a \"jurisdictional disclaimer\" that categorically disclaims \njurisdiction conferred by the federal officer removal statute, but is instead a \"claim disclaimer \" \nthat \"expressly disclaim[s] the claims upon which federal officer removal was based.\"19 Id. at \n* 10. Dougherty recognizes that \"federal courts have consistently granted motions to remand\" \nbased on \"claim disclaimers.\" Id. Defendants have provided no persuasive basis for the Court to \ndepart from that general principle here.20 \n19 In Dougherty, the Court emphasized the distinction between a \"jurisdictional claimer\" and a \n\"claim disclaimer.\" The \"jurisdictional disclaimer\" the Court found ineffective to avoid removal \nunder the federal officer removal statute stated: \nPlaintiffs hereby disclaim any cause of action or claim for recovery \nthat could give rise to federal subject matter jurisdiction under \neither 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (federal question) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442, \nsubdivision (a)(l) (federal officer). \nDougherty, 2014 WL 3542243, at *3. The \"claim disclaimers,\" on which the Court granted a \nmotion to remand, stated: \nPlaintiffs have disclaimed and hereby waive as the basis for any \nrelief in this case exposures that may have occurred during Mr. \nDougherty's service in the United States Navy from 1945-1947. \nTo the extent necessary, Plaintiffs also hereby waive all claims \nagainst Crane stemming from Mr. Dougherty's asbestos exposure \nfrom any federal government job site, and aboard Navy ships or \nany other military vessel. \nId. at *9. The disclaimer asserted by Plaintiff in this case is not a \"jurisdictional disclaimer ,\" but \na \"claim disclaimer.\" \n20 Defendants also argue that Plaintiff cannot \"factually distinguish between its alleged injuries \nresulting from the combustion of fuels produced at the government's behest, and those resulting \nfrom the combustion of fuels sold to any other consumer.\" (D.I. 96 at 58) However , Plaintiff \n18 Plaintiff rightly explains that other activities cited by Defendants -including Defendants ' \nactivities during the Korean War, the two World Wars, and events occurring still earlier than \nthese -are irrelevant for purposes of removal because Defendants ' alleged disinformation \ncampaign, which is what the instant case is actually about, started \"decades later.\" (D.I. 89 at \n29-30) Defendants are simply wrong in their insistence that all of their production activities , \nincluding those pre-dating the misconduct alleged by Plaintiff, are relevant to satisfying the \"for, \nor relating to\" requirement. (D.I. 96 at 56 n.13) Defendants ' contention relies on their \ncharacterization of Plaintiffs claims, which the Court has found to be incorrect. Plaintiff's \nclaims are not based on the \"impacts caused by the cumulative production of petroleum \nproducts,\" as contended by Defendants (see id. at 55), but are, instead, premised on the \n\"incremental impacts\" caused by Defendants ' purported disinformation and the resulting \nincreased production and consumption of petroleum products (see Tr. at 24). As Plaintiff has \nconceded, it will not be entitled to recover any damages if it turns out that Defendants' alleged \ncampaign of deception had \"zero effect on extraction , production , [ and] consumption of fossil \nfuel.\" (Id. at 26-27)21 \nalleges that the \"climatic and environmental responses to those emissions are calculable , and can \nbe attributed to Fossil Fuel Defendants on an individual and aggregate basis\" by \"quantifying \ngreenhouse gas pollution attributable to Fossil Fuel Defendants ' products and conduct.\" (D.I. 1-\n1159) \n21 Defendants rely on Acker, 527 U.S. at 432, and Defender Association, 790 F.3d at 474, for the \nproposition that the Court must credit their \"theory of the case\" for purposes of the federal \nofficer removal statute. (See D.I. 96 at 55-56) Defendants have misunderstood these cited cases. \nIn Acker, whether there was a connection between the claims in the lawsuit and the defendants ' \nofficial acts rested on disputed readings of an Ordinance imposing occupational taxes, and the \nSupreme Court credited the defendants ' reading because \"[t]o choose between those readings of \nthe Ordinance is to decide the merits of this case.\" Acker, 527 U.S. at 433. In Defender \nAssociation, whether a colorable federal defense existed turned on conflicting interpretations of a \nfederal statute, and the Third Circuit accepted the defendants ' counsel's position because \"[it] is \nthe question squarely presented by the merits of this case.\" Defender Ass 'n, 790 F.3d at 474. \n19 Excluding Defendants ' activities covered by Plaintiffs disclaimer and those predating the \naccused misconduct , the only remaining activity relevant to the \"for, or relating to\" analysis is \nDefendants ' operations under the OCS lease program.22 The Court finds that, under the Third \nCircuit's \"more permissive view\" of the \"for, or relating to\" test, Papp, 842 F.3d at 813, the issue \nof whether there is a sufficient \"connection or association \" between Plaintiffs claims and \nDefendant 's participation in the OCS lease program poses a close call. \nOn one hand, Plaintiff's claims, read as a whole, are focused on \"the disinformation and \nover-promotion campaign ,\" and the recoverable injuries are limited to those stemming from the \n\"incremental impacts\" caused by Defendant s' alleged deception and misrepresentation. (See D.I. \n89 at 28; see also Tr. at 24) Thus, the connection between the tortious misconduct alleged in the \ncomplaint and any of Defendants ' individual fossil fuel production activities , including the \noperations under the OCS lease program, may be \"too remote.\" Hoboken , 2021 WL 4077541, at \n* 1 O; see also Mayor of Baltimore v. BP P.L. C. (\"Baltimore II\"), 952 F .3d 452, 466 ( 4th Cir. \n2020).23 On the other hand, although Defendants ' participation in the OCS lease program does \nWhile an officer needs not \"win his case before he can have it removed,\" Willingham v. Morgan, \n395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969), neither Acker nor Defender Association authorize Defendants to freely \nrewrite the complaint and manufacture a cause of action explicitly disclaimed by Plaintiff and \nthen ask the Court to accept their \"theory of the case\" for purposes of removal. See Minnesota, \n2021 WL 1215656, at *5 (\"To adopt Defendants ' theory, the Court would have to weave a new \nclaim for interstate pollution out of the threads of the Complaint 's statement of injuries. This is a \nbridge too far.\"); City and Cty. of Honolulu v. Sunoco LP, 2021 WL 531237, at *7 (D. Haw. Feb. \n12, 2021) ( declining to credit Defendants ' theory of case because \"Defendants ' theory of the \ncase is not a theory for this case\"). \n22 Plaintiff also contends, and the Court agrees, that Defendants ' activities in connection with the \nEmergency Petroleum Allocation Act (\"EP AA\") (see D.I. 1 163 n.50; see also D.I. 96 at 43-44) \nare irrelevant here because the EP AA only controlled the allocation and \"distribut[ion] [ of] \navailable gasoline supplies.\" (D.I. 101 at 24-25) The EPAA did not require fossil fuel \ncompanies to increase production levels. \n23 The Fourth and Fifth Circuits have adopted the same, more lenient \"connection or association \" \ntest as the Third Circuit. See Sawyer v. Foster Wheeler LLC, 860 F.3d 249, 257-58 (4th Cir. \n20 not form the source of tort liability asserted by Plaintiff (see Tr. at 93) (\"[T]he only source of \nliability is the misrepresentation ... and the damages are restricted to the impact in Delaware .\"), \nthe activity nonetheless contributes to the broader theory about \"how the unrestrained production \nand use of Defendants ' fossil fuel products contribute to greenhouse gas pollution ,\" Baltimore II, \n952 F.3d at 467, a theory associated with Plaintiff's alleged injuries. \nThe Court need not resolve this close question here because, even assuming Defendants ' \noperations under the OCS lease program satisfy the \"for, or relating to\" test, the relationship \nbetween Defendants and the federal government under the OCS leases -for the reasons to be \nexplained in the next section -does not meet the \"acting under\" requirement. Thus, Defendant s \nhave failed to show that removal is proper under the federal officer removal statute, even \nassuming they could meet the \"for, or relating to\" test. \n2. Whether Defendants \"Acted Under\" Federal Officers \nThe \"acting under\" requirement is \"to be liberally construed to cover actions that involve \nan effort to assist, or to help carry out, the federal supervisor 's duties or tasks.\" Papp, 842 F.3d \nat 812 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).

Lockheed Martin Corp., 990 F.3d 852, 859-60 (5th Cir. 2021). Several other \ncourts, applying the apparently more stringent \"causal nexus\" standard, have found that the \nconnection between Defendants ' fossil fuel production and a similarly-situated plaintiffs claims \nis insufficient to satisfy the \"for, or relating to\" requirement of the federal officer removal \nstatute. See, e.g., Rhode Island v. Shell Oil Prods. Co. (\"Rhode Island II\"), 979 F.3d 50, 59-60 \n(1st Cir. 2020); Minnesota, 2021 WL 1215656, at *9; Honolulu, 2021 WL 531237, at *6-7; \nBoulder I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 976-78; Rhode Island I, 393 F. Supp. 3d at 152; San Mateo I, 294 \nF. Supp. 3d at 939. \n21 support federal jurisdiction under the federal officer removal statute, however, \"does not include \nsimply complying with the law.\" Id. at 152. \nRelying on the declaration of Dr. Richard Tyler Priest (D.I. 98), Defendants contend that \nthe OCS leases \"are not merely commercial transactions;\" instead, the federal government exerts \n\"substantial control and oversight \" over Defendants ' operations under the OCS leases (D.I. 96 at \n36-38). Defendants further contend that the OCS lease program reflects \"the creation of a \nvaluable national security asset for the United States over time,\" and that the OCS leases entered \ninto with Defendants are intended to achieve the same \"federal objective\" as would the creation \nof a \"national oil company.\" (Id. at 36-40) The Court does not agree that Defendants' \noperations under the OCS leases constitute acts under federal officers. \nWhat Defendants identify as \"substantial control and oversight\" over their operations is \nno more than a set of requirements that Defendants , like all other OCS lessees, must comply \nwith; specifically, federal statutes and regulations concerning operation, safety, and \nenvironmental impacts. See 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(a)(l) (authorizing OCS leases to be granted \n\"under regulations promulgated in advance\"); see also Ctr. for Sustainable Econ. v. Jewell, 779 \nF.3d 588, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (describing OCSLA as statute with \"a structure for every \nconceivable step to be taken on the path to development of an OCS leasing site\"). Dr. Priest \ngenerally opines that the regulations governing operations under the OCS leases \"went well \nbeyond those that governed the average federally regulated entity at that time.\" (D.I. 98, 19) \nDr. Priest also points to, as additional evidence that Defendants are \"acting under\" federal \nofficers, the detailed authorities provided by the statutes and regulations to federal officers to \nenforce compliance. (See, e.g., D.I. 98 ,, 20-29) However , even if a private company is \n\"subjected to intense regulation,\" compliance with law and regulations is not enough for \"acting \n22 under\" removal. See Watson, 551 U.S. at 153; see also Cty. of San Mateo v. Chevron Corp. \n(\"San Mateo II\"), 960 F.3d 586, 603 (9th Cir. 2020) (\"Mere compliance with the law, even if the \nlaws are highly detailed, and thus leave an entity highly regulated , does not show that the entity \nis acting under a federal officer.\"). Defendants fail to adduce any evidence that the federal \ngovernment has exercised \"subjection , guidance , or control\" over Defendants ' production \nactivities beyond requiring Defendants to comply with statutes and regulations governing OCS \nleases. \nFossil fuel production under the OCS leases by private companies does not amount to an \neffort to assist federal officers to \"fulfill basic government needs, accomplish key government \ntasks, or produce essential government products.\" Bd. of Cty. Comm 'rs of Boulder Cty. v. \nSuncor Energy (US.A.) Inc. (\"Boulder II\"), 965 F.3d 792, 823 (10th Cir. 2020). The type of \nrelationship contemplated by the federal officer removal statute requires that Defendants \"stand \nin for critical efforts the federal superior would be required to undertake itself in the absence of a \nprivate contract.\" Id.; see also Cty. Bd. of Arlington Cty. v. Express Scripts Pharm., Inc., 996 \nF.3d 243, 253-54 (4th Cir. 2021) (finding that defendants \"were essentially acting as the \nstatutorily authorized alter ego of the federal government\" by providing \"healthcare services that \n[Department of Defense] must, by law, provide\"); Papp, 842 F.3d at 813 (finding defendant \n\"work[ ed] under a federal contract to produce an item the government needed, to wit, a military \naircraft, and that the government otherwise would have been forced to produce on its own\"); \nIsaacson v. Dow Chem. Co., 517 F.3d 129, 137 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding defendants \"provide[d] a \nproduct that the Government was using during war,\" which it otherwise \"would have had to \nproduce itself'). Here, by contrast, Defendants fall short of demonstrating that OCS lessees are \nperforming a task that the federal government would otherwise be required to undertake itself. \n23 Additionally , Defendants are not \"tailoring [their] output to detailed federal formulations \ncustomized to meet pressing federal needs;\" rather, they are \"leasing federal land to facilitate \ncommercial production of a standardized , undifferentiated consumer product.\" Boulder II, 965 \nF.3d at 825; see also Baltimore II, 952 F.3d at 464 (\"[T]he cited provisions seem typical of any \ncommercial contract. They are incidental to sale and sound in quality assurance. \"); San Mateo \nII, 960 F.3d at 601 (\"The contracts evince an arm's-length business relationship to supply ... \ngenerally available commercial products. \"). The situation here is unlike those found in cases in \nwhich the \"acting under \" relationship was present. See, e.g., Baker v. At!. Richfield Co., 962 \nF.3d 937, 943 (7th Cir. 2020) (finding \"acting under\" relationship because of, in part, \"the \ncompulsion to provide the product to the government 's specifications \"); Sawyer, 860 F.3d at \n251-52 (finding that defendant satisfies \"acting under\" requirement by manufacturing boilers for \nuse aboard U.S. Navy vessels \"under the Navy's strict specifications \"). \nDefendants ' reference to certain congressional proposals to create a \"national oil \ncompany\" does not help them. (D.I. 96 at 39) These never-enacted bills provide no basis to find \na congressional intent to create, directly or indirectly, a \"national oil company .\" Thus, \nDefendants ' contention that they are \"acting as agents\" to achieve the same \"federal objective \" \n(i.e., facilitating oil and gas production on the OCS) as would a speculative , non-existent \n\"national oil company \" lacks merit. \nIn sum, the relationship between Defendants and the federal government under the OCS \nleases does not satisfy the \"acting under\" requirement.24 Hence, Defendants have not shown that \nremoval is proper under the federal officer removal statute. \n24 The First, Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have examined the same OCS leases at issue here, \nand all have rejected Defendants' argument that Defendants acted under federal officers by \n24 D. Jurisdiction Under The OCSLA \nThe OCSLA provides federal district courts with subject matter jurisdiction over \"cases \nand controversies arising out of, or in connection with ... any operation conducted on the outer \nContinental Shelf which involves exploration , development , or production of the minerals, of the \nsubsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf .... \" 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349(b)(l). To determine \nwhether OCSLAjurisdiction is present, the Court assesses (1) whether there is an \"operation ,\" \nand (2) whether the case \"arise[s] out of, or in connection with \" such \"operation .\" \nThe parties disagree as to the proper legal standard to be applied with respect to the first \nprong of the test. Relying on the text of the statute, Defendants contend the inquiry is \"did the \ndefendant engage in an 'operation conducted on the [OCS]' that entails the 'exploration ' and \n'production ' of 'minerals.'\" (D.I. 96 at 29) Under that interpretation , Defendants argue they \nsatisfy the \"operation\" requirement. See Honolulu , 2021 WL 53123 7, at *3 (\"Here, the parties \ndo not dispute that Defendants, at least to some extent, engage in operations of exploration , \ndevelopment, or production on the outer Continental Shelf.\"). Plaintiff, citing Fifth Circuit \nprecedent, counters that the inquiry is whether \"the activities that caused the injury constituted an \n'operation' 'conducted on the OCS' that involved the exploration and production of minerals. \" \n(D.I. 89 at 50) (citing In re Deepwater Horizon, 745 F.3d 157, 163 (5th Cir. 2014)) On this \nview, Plaintiff continues, Defendants ' \"activities that caused the injury\" are not an \"operation\" \nbecause Plaintiff's claims are rooted in Defendants ' alleged disinformation campaign, not in \nDefendants' fossil fuel production. See Baltimore I, 388 F. Supp. 3d at 566-67 (\"[T]he City's \nclaims are based on a broad array of conduct, including defendants' failure to warn consumers \ndeveloping mineral resources pursuant to OCS leases. See Rhode Island 11, 979 F.3d at 59; \nBaltimore II, 952 F.3d at 465-68; San Mateo II, 960 F.3d at 602; Boulder II, 965 F.3d at 820-27. \n25 and the public of the known dangers associated with fossil fuel products, all of which occurred \nglobally.\"); Boulder I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 978-79 (\"Defendants were not sued merely for \nproducing fossil fuel products, let alone for merely producing them on the OCS.\"). The Court \nneed not resolve this dispute because Defendants fail the second prong of the test; thus, they \ncannot invoke federal jurisdiction under the OCSLA even if they have demonstrated an \n\"operation.\" \nUnder the second prong, the Fifth Circuit -which has substantial familiarity with \nOCSLA cases -has held that Defendants must show a \"but for\" connection between \"the cause \nof action and the OCS operation. \" Deepwater Horizon, 745 F.3d at 163. Here, Defendants \ncannot satisfy this requirement. Defendants contend only that their purportedly \"significant \" \nOCS production has contributed in some way to Plaintiff's injuries (D.I. 96 at 30), but they do \nnot argue that Plaintiff would not have been injured \"but for\" Defendants ' operations on the \nOCS.25 See generally Recar v. CNG Producing Co., 853 F.2d 367,369 (5th Cir. 1988) (finding \nplaintiffs activities fall within scope of OCSLA because plaintiff \"would not have been injured \n'but for' the maintenance work he was performing and supervising on the platform\"). \nHaving failed to satisfy the \"but for\" requirement , Defendants instead argue that the \nrequirement should not apply here. Defendants first contend that the \"but for\" requirement is \n\"contrary to the text of the statute, which requires only a 'connection. \"' (D .I. 96 at 31) \nHowever , as the Supreme Court has observed, \"[t]he phrase 'in connection with' provides little \nguidance without a limiting principle.\" Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 49 (2013). In the \nCourt's view, the \"but for\" requirement as construed b y the Fifth Circuit is a reasonable principle \n25 It appears that Defendants have conceded this point, as they stated during oral argument that \n\"no one could prove but-for causation as to any particular one [i.e., an OCS operation] because it \nis so global in nature.\" (Tr. at 84) \n26 that limits the scope of the phrase. See Deepwater Horizon, 745 F.3d at 163 (\"Even though one \ncan hypothesize a 'mere connection ' between the cause of action and the OCS operation too \nremote to establish federal jurisdiction , this court deems \u00a7 1349 to require only a 'but-for' \nconnection. \"). \nDefendants also contend that while a \"but for\" connection would be sufficient to meet the \nrequirement for OCSLAjurisdiction, it is not necessary . (D.I. 96 at 31) The Court agrees, \nhowever, with the decisions that have interpreted the \"but for\" connection as a necessary \nrequirement; decisions that have also, therefore , declined to find jurisdiction based on a more \ntangential relationship. See, e.g., Robin v. Creighton -Smith, 488 F. Supp. 3d 459,465 (E.D. La. \n2020) (\"Plaintiffs' contractual claims ... are at best only tangentially related to such an \noperation and do not come close to meeting the but-for test required to give rise to \njurisdiction .\"); Bd. of Comm 'rs of the Se. La. Flood Prat. Auth.-E. v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., 29 \nF. Supp. 3d 808, 837 (E.D. La. 2014) (finding no OCSLAjurisdiction because \"Plaintiff's injury \nwould have occurred regardless of operations on the OCS, and the but-for test is not \nsatisfied.\").26 Several district courts that have considered the identical issue raised by similarly-\n26 The Court is not persuaded by Defendants ' contention to the contrary that \"[c]ourts have \nroutinely held that OCSLA jurisdiction is proper in the absence of a but-for causation. \" (D.I. 96 \nat 31-32) In the two cases cited by Defendants (both predating Deepwater Horizon) , the dispute \nwould not have existed absent an OCS operation . See EP Operating Ltd. P 'ship v. Placid Oil \nCo., 26 F.3d 563, 565 (5th Cir. 1994) (\"The current dispute arose out ofEP's attempt to recover \nsome value from these unused and depreciating assets on the OCS.\"); United Offshore Co. v. S. \nDeepwater Pipeline Co., 899 F.2d 405,407 (5th Cir. 1990) (\"The present dispute ... involves a \ncontractual dispute over the control of an entity which operates a gas pipeline [from the OCS to \nthe coast of Louisiana] .\"). \n27 situated defendants have uniformly held that a but-for connection is necessary for finding \nOCSLAjurisdiction . The Court sees no persuasive reason to depart from these holdings.27 \nSince Defendants fail to demonstrate a \"but for\" connection between their \"operations \" \non the OCS and Plaintiff's claims, they cannot rely on the OCSLA for federal jurisdiction. \nRemoval, therefore, cannot be justified on the basis of OCSLA jurisdiction. \nE. Attorneys' Fees And Costs \nPlaintiff seeks an award of attorneys ' fees and costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), \nwhich provides that \"[a]n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any \nactual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\" (See also D.l. 101 \nat 38-40) Plaintiff waived its opportunity to request attorneys ' fees and costs by raising this \nissue for the first time in its reply brief. See, e.g., Cottillion v. United Refining Co., 781 F.3d 47, \n61 (3d Cir. 2015) (finding argument made for first time in reply brief waived). In any event, \nPlaintiffs request lacks merit. \"Absent unusual circumstances , courts may award attorney's fees \nunder\u00a7 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for \nseeking removal.\" Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 141 (2005). \"[D]istrict \ncourts retain discretion to consider whether unusual circumstances warrant a departure from the \nrule in a given case.\" Id. Although the overwhelming weight of authority in other similar cases \n27 See Hoboken , 2021 WL 4077541, at *9 (\"Although it is more than plausible that fossil fuels \noriginating from the OCS led to the effects of global warming that Hoboken is now facing, this \ndoes not amount to but-for causation. \"); Minnesota , 2021 WL 1215656, at *10 (\"Defendants \noffer no basis for the Court to conclude that Minnesota 's alleged injuries would not have \noccurred but-for the Defendants' extraction activities on the OCS.\"); Rhode Island I, 393 F. \nSupp. 3d at 151-52 (\"Defendants have not shown that these injuries would not have occurred but \nfor those operations .\"); Baltimore I, 388 F. Supp. 3d at 566-67 (\"[D]efendants offer no basis to \nenable this Court to conclude that the City's claims for injuries stemming from climate change \nwould not have occurred but for defendants' extraction activities on the OCS.\"); San Mateo I, \n294 F. Supp. 3d at 938-39 (\"[D]efendants have not shown that the plaintiffs ' causes of action \nwould not have accrued but/or the defendants ' activities on the shelf'). \n28 against fossil fuel companies supports Plaintiff, the Third Circuit has not decided these issues. \nDefendants have also supplied new record evidence , including Dr. Priest's declaration , \nconcerning their operations under the OCS leases. (See Tr. at 54-55) It was not objectively \nunreasonable for Defendants to wish to litigate these removal grounds again, in this Circuit. \nFinally, the Court perceives no bad faith in Defendants ' narrowing of their bases for removal, \nand agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs lengthy complaint is fairly susceptible to different \ninterpretations (although the Court believes the best reading is the one Plaintiff has clarified it \nintended). \nFor all of these reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiffs request for attorneys' fees and \ncosts. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs motion to remand (D.I. 86) will be granted, and \nPlaintiffs request for attorneys ' fees and costs will be denied.
