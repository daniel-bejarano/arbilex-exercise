Civil Action No. 20-1653-LPS-SRF\nKILOLO KIJAKAZI,!\nCommissioner of Social Security, )\nDefendant. .\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Jennifer Marie Toy (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g)\non December 4, 2020 against the defendant Kilolo Kijakazi, the Acting Commissioner of the\nSocial Security Administration (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d). (D.I.2) Plaintiff seeks judicial review\nof the Commissioner\u2019s December 16, 2019 final decision, denying Plaintiff's claim for\ndisability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) under Titles II\nand XVI of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-434 and \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383f.\nCurrently before the court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff and the\nCommissioner.? (D.I. 14; D.I. 16) Plaintiff asks the court to reverse the Commissioner\u2019s\ndecision and remand for further administrative proceedings. (D.I. 15 at 17) The\n\nCommissioner requests that the court affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision. (D.1. 17 at 15) For the\n\n' Kilolo Kijakazi became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021.\nTherefore, pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Ms. Kijakazi is\nsubstituted as Defendant in place of Andrew Saul.\n\n2 The briefing associated with the pending motions is found at D.I. 15 and D.I. 17. On August\n27, 2021, Plaintiff filed a notice indicating her intention to rest on her opening brief. (D.I. 18)\nreasons set forth below, I recommend that the court DENY Plaintiffs motion for summary\njudgment (D.I. 14), and GRANT the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment\n(DI. 16).\ni. BACKGROUND\nA. Procedural History\nPlaintiff protectively filed applications for DIB and SSI on August 7, 2017 and\nSeptember 14, 2017, respectively, alleging a disability onset date of April 20,2017 due to bipolar\ndisorder, depression, and anxiety. (D.I. 11 at 15, 255-66, 283) Plaintiffs claims were denied\ninitially and again on reconsideration. (/d. at 114-77) At Plaintiffs request, an administrative\nlaw judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on October 29, 2019. (Jd. at 66-113) The ALJ issued an\nunfavorable decision on December 16, 2019, finding that Plaintiff was not disabled under the\nAct. (id. at 15-28) The Appeals Council subsequently denied Plaintiff's request for review of\nthe ALJ\u2019s decision, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. (Jd. at 6-\n8)\nPlaintiff brought this civil action challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision on December 4, 2020.\n(DI. 2) Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on July 19, 2021 (D.I. 14), and the\nCommissioner cross-moved for summary judgment on August 18, 2021 (D.I. 16). Briefing is\nnow complete on the pending motions.\nB. Medical History\n1. Medical evidence\nPlaintiff was 39 years old on April 20, 2017, her alleged disability onset date. (D.I. 11 at\n26) Plaintiff has a high school degree and two years of college, and she has past relevant work\n\nas a retail cashier. (/d. at 70-71) The ALJ found that Plaintiff had the following severe\nimpairments: bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. (/d. at 18) The focus of Plaintiff's\nmotion for summary judgment is on the adequacy of the ALJ\u2019s assessment of the medical\nopinion evidence. (D.I. 15)\n\nPlaintiff was hospitalized in November 2015 after attempting suicide by overdosing on\npain medication. (D.I. 11 at 453) She was involuntarily committed to the inpatient unit at the\nMeadowWood Psychiatric center for five days. (/d. at 453, 455-56, 502) Records from\nMeadow Wood indicate that Plaintiff was diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder and\nimpulse control disorder, but her condition improved with medication management and\npsychotherapeutic activities. (Id. at 504)\n\nPlaintiff was hospitalized for suicidal ideation a second time in June 2017, and she was\ndischarged to inpatient treatment at MeadowWood with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder,\nanxiety, and bipolar disorder. (Jd. at 513-16) When she was discharged from MeadowWood,\nPlaintiff was sleeping better, her appetite had improved, her depression was under control, and\nshe denied any suicidal ideations. (Id. at 546) Over the next few months, Plaintiffs care\nproviders at Westside Family Healthcare noted overall improvements in her symptoms,\nparticularly after Plaintiff and her husband were able to avoid eviction, and they adjusted her\nmedications to eliminate side effects such as blackouts, hallucinations, and skin rashes. (/d. at\n566, 568, 575-76, 578, 580, 585, 587, 589)\n\nIn early 2018, Plaintiff reported feeling more balanced and less depressed, and she was\nable to return to work part-time. (/d. at 624, 626, 630) However, she was hospitalized for\nsuicidal ideation again in August 2018 and was thereafter admitted to Rockford Center for\ntreatment of her bipolar disorder and adjustment of her medications. (Jd. at 789, 819-23) By\n\nSeptember 2018, Plaintiff reported that her mood was stable and she was working three days per\nweek. (Jd. at 885) During the ensuing months, Plaintiff indicated that it was difficult for her to\nfunction at work, and she experienced increased anxiety and panic attacks due to work-related\nstress. (/d. at 852, 902) Plaintiff reduced her work schedule to two days per week, and by\nAugust 2019, she reported that she was feeling much better with fewer side effects from her\nmedication. (/d. at 796-818, 924)\n2. Medical opinions\n\nPlaintiff attended a consultative psychological exam with Ramnik Singh, M.D. in\nFebruary 2018. (D.I. 11 at 778) Dr. Singh observed that Plaintiff was well groomed and made\ngood eye contact, but her affect was blunted, her mood was irritable, and she was hyperverbal\nbut redirectable. (/d. at 779) Upon examination, Plaintiff exhibited no abnormalities in her\nthought process and no hallucinations, paranoia, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. (/d.) Her\nmemory was intact. (/d.) Dr. Singh diagnosed Plaintiff with bipolar disorder and gave her a\nglobal assessment of functioning (\u201cGAF\u201d) score of 65. (/d. at 780) Dr. Singh estimated that\nPlaintiff would have moderate limitations in her ability to perform work-related tasks, interact\nwith others, and perform activities of daily living. (Id. at 781-82)\n\nIn December 2018, Plaintiff's primary care physician Victoria Shertel, D.O., completed a\nPsychological Functional Capacity evaluation regarding Plaintiffs condition. (/d. at 786-88)\nDr. Shertel opined that Plaintiff's ability to work 40 hours per week depended on how well her\nsymptoms were controlled. (/d. at 786) According to Dr. Shertel, Plaintiff had moderate to\nsevere restrictions in activities of daily living and the ability to sustain work performance and\nattendance in a normal work setting. (/d. at 787-88) In January 2019, Dr. Shertel completed\nanother health assessment in which she reported that Plaintiff cannot participate in a small group\n\nsetting, be punctual and keep a schedule, or participate in a training program, but she is able to\nindependently complete activities of daily living and follow written and verbal directions. (Jd. at\n926-27) Dr. Shertel indicated that, despite ongoing behavioral health treatment and medication,\nPlaintiffs mood was not yet stable enough to sustain a return to work, and she estimated that\nPlaintiff would be unable to work for a period of six to nine months.? (Id.)\n\nNgozi Chiekwu, a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, completed a\nPsychological Functional Capacity assessment in October 2019, opining that Plaintiff does not\nhave the ability to work full-time due to her manic and depressive episodes, which contribute to\na lack of focus and concentration and an inability to remain on task. (Jd. at 930-31) Ms.\nChiekwu opined that Plaintiff had severe limitations in her ability to sustain work performance\nand attendance and to cope with the pressures of ordinary work, and moderate limitations in her\nability to understand and follow instructions and perform routine, repetitive tasks. (/d. at 932)\n\nC. Hearing Before the ALJ\n\n1. Plaintiff's Testimony\n\nAt the administrative hearing on October 29, 2019, Plaintiff testified that she has a high\nschool diploma and an associate\u2019s degree in fine art. (D.I. 11 at 70-71) At the time of the\nhearing, Plaintiff testified that she was working a six-hour shift one day per week as a store\ncashier. (/d. at 71-72) Plaintiff also worked at the store from 2004 to 2015 as the night manager,\nwhich involved the additional duties of completing closing paperwork, locking up the store,\nchecking in orders, and managing an employee. (/d. at 72-74) From 2015 to 2016, Plaintiff\ntestified that she performed cashier and stocking duties at a retail store. (/d. at 74)\n\nPlaintiff testified that she lives with her husband and two cats in a single-family home.\n\n3 The law is well-established that medical source opinions regarding whether a claimant is\ndisabled or unable to work are reserved for the Commissioner and are not given any weight. See\nMoore v. Colvin, 239 F. Supp. 3d 845, 859 (D. Del. 2017).\n\n5\n(id. at 75-76) Plaintiff indicated that she is able to care for her cats, but she has not driven a car\nfor about ten years because she lacks the concentration to do so. (/d. at 76)\n\nPlaintiff explained that she was hospitalized in 2015 after making a suicide attempt upon\nlosing her job. (/d. at 77-78) When she was released from the hospital, she was involuntarily\ncommitted to MeadowWood and thereafter received outpatient treatment at Westside Medical,\nwhere she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. (/d. at 77-79) Plaintiff testified that some of the\npsychotropic medications she was prescribed made her hallucinate, black out, and break out in\nrashes, and she still had not achieved a stable medication regimen at the time of the hearing. (/d.\nat 79-80)\n\nPlaintiff was hospitalized and transferred to MeadowWood again in 2017 because her\ncondition was unstable and her medication required adjustment. (/d. at 80-81) At that time,\nPlaintiff reported having difficulty leaving her house. (/d. at 82) She was brought to the\nemergency room again in 2018 for suicidal ideation and was subsequently admitted to Rockford\nCenter, where her medications were adjusted and she experienced negative side effects. (/d. at\n81)\n\nAt home, Plaintiff testified that she spends her time cleaning, but she lacks the\nconcentration to maintain her former hobbies. (/d. at 87) Although she occasionally goes\ngrocery shopping, she does not often leave the house. (/d. at 88) Her friends sometimes come to\nvisit her, but she does not go out with them. (/d.) Plaintiff reported that her sleep schedule\nvaries, and she sometimes naps because her medications make her drowsy. (Jd.)\n\nPlaintiff's husband, Jeffrey Toy, testified that he had been married to Plaintiff for thirteen\nyears at the time of the hearing. (/d. at 89-90) Mr. Toy explained that he made a special room in\n\ntheir house filled with things Plaintiff enjoys as a retreat during her depressive symptoms, but\nmost of the time she stays in the fetal position in a reclining chair. (/d. at 92-94) He testified\nthat she does laundry when necessary, she sometimes cooks, and she is able to independently\nwalk or take the bus to her medical appointments. (/d. at 94-95, 100-01) Mr. Toy indicated that\nPlaintiff's condition improved when she reduced her schedule from three days a week to one day\na week and relinquished her managerial responsibilities. (/d. at 100)\n2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ\n\nAt the administrative hearing, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical to vocational\nexpert (\u201cVE\u201d):\n\n[P]lease assume an individual of the claimant\u2019s age, education and experience. If\n\nsuch an individual is never able to climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds, never able to\n\ntolerate exposure to hazards such as moving machinery or unprotected heights,\n\nthat the individual can perform no more than simple, routine, repetitive tasks and\n\ncannot work at a production pace, so no assembly line type work. If the\n\nindividual is limited to simple work related decisions and can tolerate no more\n\nthan a few changes in a routine work setting, if the individual can frequently\n\ninteract with supervisors and coworkers but work in tandem or directly with\n\nothers no more than occasional, and interacting with the public no more than\n\noccasional. Would such an individual be able to perform the claimant\u2019s past\n\nwork?\n(DI. 11 at 106-07) In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the VE testified that such a\nhypothetical individual could not perform Plaintiff's former work as a retail cashier because her\npast work was semiskilled. (/d. at 107) However, the VE testified that the hypothetical\nindividual could perform work at a medium physical demand level as a laundry worker, a\npackager, or a kitchen helper. (/d.)\n\nThe ALJ then asked the VE to consider whether any positions would be available for the\nhypothetical individual at a light or sedentary exertional level. (/d. at 108) The VE responded\n\nthat Plaintiff could perform work as a mail clerk or an electronics worker at the light exertional\n\nlevel, and she could work as a document preparer or final assembler at the sedentary exertional\nlevel. (Id.)\n\nPlaintiff's counsel asked the VE about an employer\u2019s tolerance for off task behavior and\nabsences. (Id.) The VE responded that an employer would tolerate an employee\u2019s off task\nbehavior for no more than 10% of the workday, and absences of one day per month or ten days\nper year are work preclusive. (/d.)\n\nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings\n\nBased on the factual evidence in the record and the testimony by Plaintiff and the VE, the\nALJ determined that Plaintiff was not disabled under the Act for the relevant time period\nbeginning on April 20, 2017. (D.L. 11 at 17-28) The ALJ found, in pertinent part:\n\n1. The claimant meets the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act\nthrough December 31, 2022.\n\n2. The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since April 20,\n2017, the alleged onset date (20 CFR 404.1571 et seq., and 416.971 et seq.).\n\n3. The claimant has the following severe impairments: bipolar disorder,\ndepression, and anxiety (20 CFR 404.1520(c) and 416.920(c)).\n\n4. The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that\nmeets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(d), 404.1525,\n404.1526, 416.920(d), 416.925 and 416.926).\n\n5. After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the\nclaimant has the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of work at\nall exertional levels but with the following nonexertional limitations: The\nclaimant cannot climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, and cannot be exposed to\nhazards. The claimant can perform simple, routine, and repetitive tasks, not at\na production pace and involving no more than simple work-related decisions,\nwith few changes in a routine work setting. She can have frequent interaction\nwith supervisors and coworkers, perform occasional tandem work, and have\noccasional interaction with the public.\n\n6. The claimant is unable to perform any past relevant work (20 CFR 404.1565\nand 416.965).\n\n7. The claimant was born on December 21, 1977 and was 39 years old, which is\ndefined as a younger individual age 18-49, on the alleged disability onset date\n(20 CFR 404.1563 and 416.963).\n\n8. The claimant has at least a high school education and is able to communicate\nin English (20 CFR 404.1564 and 416.964).\n\n9. Transferability of job skills is not material to the determination of disability\nbecause using the Medical-Vocational Rules as a framework supports a\nfinding that the claimant is \u201cnot disabled,\u201d whether or not the claimant has\ntransferable job skills (See SSR 82-41 and 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P,\nAppendix 2).\n10. Considering the claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and residual\nfunctional capacity, there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the\nnational economy that the claimant can perform (20 CFR 404.1569(a),\n416.969, and 416.969(a)).\n11. The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security\nAct, from April 20, 2017, through the date of this decision (20 CFR\n404.1520(g) and 416.920(g)).\nMLL 11 at 17-28)\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nJudicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial\nevidence supports the decision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); Biestek v. Berryhill, 139 S.\nCt. 1148, 1154 (2019). \u201cSubstantial evidence means enough relevant evidence that \u2018a reasonable\n\n209\n\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d Pearson v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 839\nF. App\u2019x 684, 687 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154). When applying the\nsubstantial evidence standard, the court \u201clooks to an existing administrative record and asks\nwhether it contains \u2018sufficien[t] evidence\u2019 to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d\nBiestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).\nThe threshold for satisfying the substantial evidence standard is \u201cnot high[,]\u201d requiring \u201cmore\n\nthan a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. Id.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Disability Determination Process\n\nTitle II of the Act affords insurance benefits to people who contributed to the program\nand who have a disability. See Pearson, 839 F. App\u2019x at 687 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)). A\ndisability is the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically\ndeterminable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which\nhas lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is only disabled if the impairments are so severe that they\npreclude a return to previous work or engagement in any other kind of substantial gainful work\nexisting in the national economy. Jd. at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 21-22\n(2003). To qualify for disability insurance benefits, a claimant must establish disability prior to\nthe date last insured. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.131 (2016); Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611-12 (3d\nCir. 2014). Title XVI of the Act \u201cprovides for the payment of disability benefits to indigent\npersons under the Supplemental Security Income program.\u201d Bowen v. Yucket, 482 U.S. 137, 140\n(1987); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381(a).\n\nThe Commissioner must perform a five-step analysis to determine whether a person is\ndisabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920; Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 427-28 (3d Cir.\n1999). If the Commissioner makes a finding of disability or non-disability at any point in the\nsequential process, the Commissioner will not review the claim further. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4)(i). At step one, the Commissioner determines whether the\nclaimant is engaged in any substantial gainful activity. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(@),\n\n416.920(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful activity, step two requires\n\n10\nthe Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment or a\nsevere combination of impairments. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii).\n\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, at step three, the Commissioner compares the\nclaimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments that are presumed severe enough to preclude any\ngainful work. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(iii); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428.\nWhen a claimant\u2019s impairment or its equivalent matches a listed impairment, the claimant is\npresumed disabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(iii). If a claimant\u2019s\nimpairment, either singly or in combination, fails to meet or medically equal any listing, the\nanalysis continues to steps four and five. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e).\n\nAt step four, the ALJ considers whether the claimant retains the residual functional\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv),\n416.920(a)(4)(iv); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. A claimant\u2019s RFC \u201cmeasures the most she can do\ndespite her limitations.\u201d Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting 20 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 404.1545(a)(1)) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). The claimant bears the burden of\ndemonstrating the inability to return to past relevant work. See Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428.\n\nIf the claimant is unable to return to past relevant work, at step five, the Commissioner\nmust demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s impairments do not preclude an adjustment to any other\navailable work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(g), 416.920(g); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. In other\nwords, the Commissioner must prove that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in\nthe national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments,\nage, education, past work experience, and [RFC].\u201d Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. The ALJ must\n\nanalyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he or she\n\n11\nis capable of performing work and is not disabled. See id. The ALJ often seeks the VE\u2019s\nassistance in making this finding. See id.\n\nB. Whether the ALJ\u2019s Decision is Supported by Substantial Evidence\n\nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment focuses on whether the ALJ properly evaluated\nthe medical opinion evidence. (D.I. 15 at 6-17) In accordance with the revised regulatory\nframework for claims filed on or after March 27, 2017, which eliminated the treating physician\nrule, an ALJ is not required to give any \u201cspecific evidentiary weight, including controlling\nweight, to any medical opinion(s) . . ., including those from [a] medical source.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n404.1520c(a); 416.920c(a). Instead, the ALJ must consider the persuasiveness of all medical\nopinions based on the application of five factors: (1) supportability; (2) consistency; (3)\nrelationship with the claimant; (4) specialization; and (5) other factors. Id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(a)-\n(c); 416.920c(a)-(c).\n\nThe ALJ must explain how she considered the most important factors of supportability\nand consistency. Id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2); 416.920c(b)(2). \u201cConsistency concerns the degree\nto which the opinion reflects the same limitations described in evidence from other sources,\nwhereas supportability concerns the relevancy of objective medical evidence and degree of\nexplanation given by the medical source to support the limitations assessed in the opinion.\u201d\nEader vy. Saul, 2020 WL 10898140, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 20, 2020) (quoting Serowski v. Comm\u2019r\nof Soc. Sec., 2020 WL 6383187, at *12-13 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 30, 2020)). There is no requirement\nfor the ALJ to discuss or explain consideration of the remaining factors unless there are two or\nmore medical opinions which are equally well supported and consistent with the record, but not\nexactly the same, in which case the ALJ must explain how she differentiated the opinions. 20\n\nCER. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2)-(3); 416.920c(b)(2)-(3).\n\n12\nIn this case, the ALJ determined that the opinion of Plaintiff's treating source, Dr.\nShertel, was not persuasive because the restrictive limitations therein were not supported by \u201cthe\noverall benign findings on mental status examinations throughout the relevant time period,\nincluding no signs of attention or concentration issues, no memory impairments, and good\nabilities in coping with her symptoms.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 24) The ALJ observed that Plaintiff reported\nindependence in her activities of daily living, and Plaintiff's medical records established that her\ncondition improved with consistent treatment and medication management, allowing her to\nreturn to work on a part-time basis as a cashier. (/d.) Indeed, the ALJ relied on Dr. Shertel\u2019s\nown treatment records showing that Plaintiff was alert, well nourished, well groomed, and\nexhibited no acute distress. (Jd. at 570, 850, 853) The ALJ concluded that this evidence was\ninconsistent with Dr. Shertel\u2019s opinion that Plaintiff had a \u201cmoderate severe\u201d degree of\nimpairment in \u201crestriction of daily activities\u201d and in the ability to \u201csustain work performance and\nattendance in a normal work setting.\u201d (Jd. at 787-88) In this regard, the ALJ directly addressed\nthe limitations expressed in Dr. Shertel\u2019s opinion and articulated why she found them to be\ninconsistent with Plaintiff's treatment notes and other evidence of record. The ALJ\u2019s assessment\nof Dr. Shertel\u2019s opinion meets the standard in the new regulations, and her determination is\nsupported by substantial evidence. See Laicha v. Kijakazi, 2021 WL 3929739, at *12 (M.D. Pa.\nSept. 2, 2021) (upholding ALJ\u2019s rejection of treating source opinion as unpersuasive because\n\u201cthe opinion was inconsistent with his treatment notes . . . as well as [the claimant\u2019s] self-\nreported activities of daily living.\u201d).\n\nThe same is true of the ALJ\u2019s determination that Ms. Chiekwu\u2019s opinion was not\npersuasive because the restrictive limitations therein were not supported by \u201cthe overall benign\n\nfindings on mental status examinations throughout the relevant time period, including no signs of\n\n13\nattention or concentration issues, no memory impairments, and good abilities in coping with her\nsymptoms.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 24-25) Ms. Chiekwu opined that Plaintiff suffered moderately severe\nrestrictions in her daily activities and severe restrictions in sustaining work performance and\nattendance and coping with the pressures of ordinary work, but this opinion is inconsistent with\nMs. Chiekwu\u2019s own treatment records. (/d.) Specifically, Ms. Chiekwu performed a series of\nmental status exams in which Plaintiff routinely presented as calm and relaxed, she spoke at a\nnormal rate and volume, her affect was appropriate, and she exhibited no signs of hallucinations,\ndelusions, bizarre behaviors, suicidal ideation, anxiety, or hyperactive or attentional difficulties.\n(Id. at 799, 808, 813) Ms. Chiekwu noted that, despite Plaintiff's subjective reports of\ndepression and panic attacks, Plaintiff's mental status exam continued to reveal \u201cno apparent\nserious mental status abnormalities,\u201d with a normal attention span and intact memory and\njudgment. (/d. at 816) Plaintiff's subjective reports of her mental limitations \u201cwill not alone\nestablish that [she] is disabled\u201d in the absence of \u201cobjective medical evidence from an acceptable\nmedical source[.]\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529(a); 416.929(a).\n\nPursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(c)(2) and 416.920c(c)(2), \u201c[t]he more consistent a\nmedical opinion(s) . . . is with the evidence from other medical sources and nonmedical sources\nin the claim, the more persuasive the medical opinion(s) . . . will be.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n404.1520c(c)(2); 416.920c(c)(2). Thus, the inquiry regarding consistency is directed to the\nrecord as a whole, and not just to the narrow universe of medical opinions. See Laicha v.\nKijakazi, 2021 WL 3929739, at *12 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 2, 2021) (upholding ALJ\u2019s rejection of\ntreating source opinion as unpersuasive because \u201cthe opinion was inconsistent with his treatment\nnotes . . . as well as [the claimant\u2019s] self-reported activities of daily living.\u201d).\n\nHere, the record as a whole contains substantial evidence in support of the ALJ\u2019s\n\n14\nconclusion that the limitations set forth in the opinions of Dr. Shertel and Ms. Chiekwu are not\nconsistent with Plaintiff's benign mental status examinations and work history throughout the\nrelevant time period. Mental status exams by other providers indicate that Plaintiff was well-\ngroomed and calm, with normal affect and speech and intact short- and long-term memory. (D.I.\n11 at 579, 583, 589, 597-98, 606-07, 627, 633) Although Plaintiff exhibited some anxiety and\ndepression, she routinely exhibited normal attention span and ability to concentrate, and she was\nalert and attentive. (/d. at 580, 585, 587, 592, 595, 600, 609, 630, 874, 902, 904, 906, 908, 910,\n912, 914, 916, 918, 920, 922, 924) Moreover, Plaintiffs part-time work history during the\nrelevant time period is at odds with Dr. Shertel\u2019s opinion that Plaintiff cannot participate in a\nsmall group setting or be punctual and keep a schedule and Ms. Chiekwu\u2019s opinion that Plaintiff\nlacks the focus and concentration necessary to sustain work performance and cope with the\npressures of ordinary work. (Jd. at 876, 893, 927, 930-32) For these reasons, substantial\nevidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount the opinions of Dr. Shertel and Ms. Chiekwu as\nnot persuasive. Because these opinions were not equally well-supported by the administrative\nrecord, the ALJ was not required to consider additional factors under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c\nand 416.920c beyond consistency and supportability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2);\n416.920c(b)(2); see also Galloway v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2021 WL 4477145, at *4 (E.D. Pa.\nSept. 30, 2021) (stating that the ALJ is obligated to compare the claimant\u2019s routine and\nconservative medical records with the severe limitations identified in a medical opinion under\nthe applicable case law and controlling regulations).\n\nPlaintiff also challenges the ALJ\u2019s assessment of Dr. Singh\u2019s opinion. (D.I. 15 at 12-14)\nThe ALJ was persuaded by Dr. Singh\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiff has only moderate limitations in\n\nfunctioning because his findings were consistent with the overall normal findings in Plaintiff's\n\n15\nmental status examinations and Plaintiff's reported improvement with therapy and medication\nmanagement. (D.I. 11 at 22-23) Although Plaintiff suggests that Dr. Singh identified abnormal\nfindings in his mental status examination, Dr. Singh\u2019s opinion suggests otherwise. Dr. Singh\nconfirmed that Plaintiff was neatly groomed, her thought process showed no abnormality, and\nshe had no hallucinations, paranoia, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. (D.I. 15 at 13; D.I. 11 at\n779) Dr. Singh described Plaintiff as alert and oriented, and he reported that she had no deficits\nin immediate or remote memory. (D.I. 11 at 779) The only findings Plaintiff characterizes as\n\u201cabnormal\u201d are Dr. Singh\u2019s notes that Plaintiff's affect was blunted and constricted to irritable\nmood, she was hyperverbal but was redirectable, and she had difficulty doing serial sevens. (/d.;\nD.I. 15 at 12) Plaintiff offers no authority to suggest that observations of this kind are sufficient\nto render a claimant\u2019s mental status examination \u201cabnormal.\u201d Plaintiff also offers no authority in\nsupport of her position that a physician performing a consultative examination is required to\nreview the claimant\u2019s medical records.* The ALJ\u2019s assessment of Dr. Singh\u2019s opinion is\nsupported by substantial evidence in the form of his consultative examination notes, as well as\nPlaintiff's routinely benign mental status examinations and work history throughout the relevant\n\ntime period.\n\n4 The regulations provide that the Commissioner will order a consultative examination at its own\nexpense if the claimant\u2019s medical sources cannot or will not provide sufficient medical evidence\nabout the impairment to make a disability determination. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1512; 404.1517;\n416.912; 416.917. In these circumstances, the Commissioner \u201cwill also give the [consultative]\nexaminer any necessary background information about [the claimant\u2019s] condition.\u201d Jd. The\nregulations do not articulate any particular level of consideration the consulting physician must\ngive to the existing medical record, perhaps because the purpose of a consultative examination is\nto remedy a lack of evidence in the record. Regardless, Dr. Singh\u2019s assessment demonstrates his\nawareness of Plaintiff's hospitalizations and psychiatric treatment. (D.I. 11 at 778)\n\n16\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court DENY Plaintiff's motion for\nsummary judgment (D.I. 14), and GRANT the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary\njudgment (D.I. 16).\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
