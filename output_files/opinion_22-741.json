Andrews", "date": "11-14-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nMICHAEL GONZALEZ-GUERRERO,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ. No. 22-741-RGA\nBNY MELLON, et al.,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this14th day of November, 2022;\n\nIT IS ORDERED that (1) Plaintiff's request for electronic filing rights (D.I. 6) is\nDENIED without prejudice; (2) Plaintiffs request for counsel (D.1. 12) is DENIED without\nprejudice; and (3) Plaintiff's motion for an extension of time to respond to the motion to\ndismiss (D.I. 18) is DISMISSED as moot.\n\nElectronic Filing Rights. Plaintiff requested electronic filing rights and, on\nSeptember 20, 2022, he was advised to supplement his request in writing and indicate\nwhether or not he had independently reviewed all the materials and related electronic\nfiling topics on the Courts website and whether he has a PACER account. (D.I. 8). To\ndate, Plaintiff has not supplemented his request. Therefore, the motion is denied.\n\nRequest for Counsel. Plaintiff has filed a request for counsel. (D.I. 12). He\nstates, \u201cI would like to have a court appointed lawyer if possible.\u201d (/d.). A pro se\n\nlitigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or statutory right to\n\nrepresentation by counsel. See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d Cir.\n2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993). However, representation by\ncounsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a finding that a plaintiff's\nclaim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.\n\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of\nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in\ndeciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the\nmerits of the plaintiff's claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her case\nconsidering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon\nhim or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to\nwhich factual investigation is required and the plaintiffs ability to pursue such\ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiffs capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf, and\n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony.\nSee Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at\n155-56. The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative. Tabron, 6 F.3d\nat 157.\n\nPlaintiff provides no grounds for counsel. He merely asks for one. The\nthreshold issue for appointment of counsel is that there be a claim that has arguable\nmerit in fact and law. Right now, Plaintiff does not meet that requirement. In\nreviewing the Complaint, it appears to be time-barred, there appears to be a failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies, and it appears the Complaint fails to state claims upon\n\nwhich relief can be granted. Accordingly, Plaintiffs request for counsel is denied\n\nwithout prejudice.\nExtension of Time. Plaintiff moves to respond to the motion to dismiss until\nafter ruling on his request for counsel. (D.I. 18). He nevertheless timely filed the\n\nresponse. Thus, Plaintiff's motion for an extension of time is dismissed as moot.\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n"}
