No. 20- 980-CFC -JLH \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \n \nPending before the Court are the parties \u2019 claim construction disputes.  There are seven \npatents at issue in this case .  Plaintiffs Acera Surgical, Inc. , Retectix, LLC, and Washington \nUniversity (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) are asserting four  patents against Defendants  Nanofiber \nSolutions, LLC  (\u201cNanofiber\u201d) , Paragen Technologies LLC, Atreon Orthopedics LLC, and \nRenovoderm LLC.  Defendant Nanofiber , as well as  The Research Foundation for the State    \n \n \n2 \n \n University of New York  (collectively, with the  other defendants , \u201cDefendants \u201d1), are asserting \nthree patents against  Plaintiff Acera Surgical, Inc.   All seven patents generally relate to biomedical \npatches and grafts made from electrospun nanofibers .   \nThe parties \u2019 joint claim construction  brief indicated that the parties had agreed upon two  \nconstructions and had disputes over seven  terms  spanning five of the patents -in-suit.  (D.I. 120.)  I \nheld a Markman hearing on August 12, 2022.  (\u201cTr. __ .\u201d)  Following a lengthy interchange, I \ninstructed the parties to further meet  and confer regarding three of the disputed terms .  The parties \nsubsequently submitted a joint letter in which they agreed on one term and modified their proposals \nregarding the other two.  (D.I. 136.)  Six  terms remain in dispute.    \nI recommend that the parties\u2019 agreed -upon constructions be adopted as follows:  \nTerm  Recommended Construction  \n \nmulti- laminar  \n \n\u02bc512 patent , claims 1 -3, 5-10, 12- 14 \n  \n\u201cmultiple layers\u201d  \n \nprojection/projections  \n  \n\u02bc228 patent , claims 7, 8, 14, 19 \n  \n\u201ca protrusion or bulge\u201d  \n \nindentation/indentations  \n  \u02bc228 patent , claims 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 19 \n  \n\u201ca recess or depression\u201d  \n \n \n \n1 The parties\u2019 briefing refers to any party who isn\u2019t a Plaintiff as a \u201cDefendant.\u201d  (D.I. 120.)  \nThis Report and Recommendation will do the same.    \n \n \n3 \n \n Further, for the reasons discussed in more detail below, I recommend that the disputed \nterms be construed as follows:  \nTerm  Recommended Construction  \n \nfirst layer/second layer  \n  \n\u02bc512 patent , claims 1, 8, 15 \n   \n\u201cfirst distinct and separately deposited \nthickness of material \u201d \n\u201csecond distinct and separately deposited thickness of material\u201d  \n  \n \nfirst layer/second layer/third layer  \n  \u02bc687 patent , claims 1, 5, 7 \n  \n\u201cfirst distinct and separately deposited thickness of material\u201d  \n\u201csecond distinct and separately deposited thickness of material\u201d  \n\u201cthird  distinct and separately deposited \nthickness of material\u201d  \n \n \nfirst plurality/second plurality  \n  \u02bc444 patent , claims 1 -8, 10, 16, 17   \n\u201cfirst distinct and separately deposited \ngrouping\u201d  \n\u201csecond distinct and separately deposited grouping\u201d  \n  \n \nprepared from at least one solution of at least one polymer utilizing a process selected from the group consisting of electro- spinning, \nelectro -blowing, blowing -assisted electro -\nspinning, and solution blowing   \u02bc166 patent , claim 26  \n   \nProcess limitation of a product -by-process \nclaim  \n \nprepared from about 1 to about 5 solutions of from about 1 to about 5 polymers  \n  \u02bc166 patent , claim 27  \n   \nProcess limitation of a product -by-process \nclaim     \n \n \n4 \n \n  \nformed by electrospinning fibers  \n  \n\u02bc765 patent , claim s 1, 49  \n   \nProcess limitation of a product -by-process \nclaim  \n \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nThe purpose of the claim construction  process  is to \u201c determin[e] the meaning and scope of \nthe patent claims asserted to be infringed.\u201d   Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, \n976 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc), aff \u2019d, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  When the parties have an  actual dispute \nregarding the proper scope of claim  terms, their dispute must be resolved by the judge, not the \njury.  I d. at 979.  The Court only needs to construe a claim term if there is a dispute over its \nmeaning, and it only needs to be construed to the extent necessary to resolve the dispute.  Vivid \nTechs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. & Eng\u2019 g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999).   \n\u201c[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for conducting claim construction.\u201d  Phillips v. \nAWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2005) .  But there are guiding principles.  Id.  \u201cThe \ninquiry into how a person of ordinary skill in the art understands a claim term provides an objective baseline from which to begin claim interpretation. \u201d  Id. at 1313.  In some cases, the ordinary \nmeaning of a claim term, as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, is readily apparent even to a lay  person and requires \u201clittle more than the application of the widely accepted meaning \nof commonly understood words.\u201d   Id.  at 1314.  Where the meaning is not readily apparent, \nhowever , the court may look to \u201c those sources available to the public that show w hat a person of \nskill in the art would have understood disputed claim language to mean. \u201d  Innova/Pure Water, Inc. \nv. Safari Water Filtration Sys., Inc., 381 F.3d 1111, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 2004) .  Those sources include \n\u201cthe words of the claims themselves, the r emainder of the specification, the prosecution history,    \n \n \n5 \n \n and extrinsic evidence concerning relevant scientific principles, the meaning of technical terms, \nand the state of the art. \u201d  Id. \n\u201c[T]he claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular \nclaim terms. \u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1314.  For example, \u201cthe context in which a term is used in the \nasserted claim can be highly instructive.\u201d  Id .  Considering other, unasserted, claims can also be \nhelpful.  Id.   \u201cFor example, the presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation \ngives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\u201d  Id. at 1314- 15.   \nIn addition, the \u201cclaims must be read in view of the specification, of which they are a part.\u201d  \nId. at 1315 (quoting Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ).  \nThe specification \u201cis always highly relevant to  the claim construction analysis.\u201d  Id.  (quoting \nVitronics , 90 F.3d at 1582).  The specification may contain a special definition given to a claim \nterm by the patentee, in which case, the patentee\u2019 s lexicography governs .  Id.  at 1316.  The \nspecification may also reveal an intentional disclaimer or disavowal of claim scope.  Id.   However, \n\u201ceven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusi on or restriction.\u201d  Hill- Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker \nCorp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal marks omitted). \nCourts should also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution history.  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317.  \nIt may inform \u201c the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood \nthe invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be. \u201d  Id.  Statements made by a patentee or patent    \n \n \n6 \n \n owne r durin g inter partes review  may also be considered.  Aylus Networks, Inc. v. Apple Inc., 856 \nF.3d 1353, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2017) . \nIn appropriate cases, courts may also consider extrinsic evidence, which \u201c consists of all \nevidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, \ndictionaries, and learned treatises. \u201d Markman, 52 F.3d at 980.  For example, dictionaries, \nespecially technical dictionaries, can be helpful resources during claim construction by providing insight into commonly accepted meanings of a term to those of skill in the art.  Phillips , 415 F.3d \nat 1318.  E xpert testimony can als o be useful \u201c to ensure that the court \u2019s understanding of the \ntechnical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field. \u201d \nId.; see also Teva Pharm s.

The first includes U.S. Patent No. \n10,617,512 (the \u201c\u02bc 512 patent \u201d), titled \u201cBiomedical Patches with Aligned Fibers .\u201d  The second \nincludes U.S. Patent Nos. 10,080,687 (the \u201c\u02bc 687 patent \u201d) and 10,682,444 (the \u201c\u02bc 444 patent \u201d), both \ntitled \u201cBiomedical Patches with Spatially Arranged Fibers. \u201d  The third includes U .S. Patent N o. \n10,632,228 (the \u201c\u02bc 228 patent \u201d), titled \u201c Tissue Substitute Materials and Methods for Tissue \nRepair .\u201d  The parties have disputes over terms in the \u02bc512, \u02bc687, and \u02bc444 patents.   \nA. \u02bc512 patent: \u201cfirst layer \u201d/\u201csecond layer\u201d  \nThe first set of terms for which the parties seek construction are \u201cfirst layer\u201d and \u201c second \nlayer,\u201d found in independent claims 1, 8 , and 15 of the \u02bc512 pa tent. \n Claim 1 of the \u02bc512 patent provides:     \n \n \n7 \n \n 1. A multi -laminar electrospun nanofiber scaffold for use in \nrepairing a defect in a tissue substrate, the multi- laminar electrospun \nnanofiber scaffold comprising:  \na first layer formed by a first plurality of deposited \nelectrospun polymeric fibers ; and  \na second layer formed by a second plurality of deposited \nelectrospun polymeric fibers, wherein the second \nlayer is combined with the first layer , \nwherein at least a first portion of the multi- laminar \nelectrospun nanofiber scaffold comprises a higher density of fibers than a second portion of  the mul ti-\nlaminar electrospun nanofiber scaffold, wherein the first portion comprises a higher tensile strength than the second portion,  \nwherein the multi- laminar electrospun nanofiber scaffold is \nconfigured to degrade via hydrolysis after at least one of a predetermined time or an environmental condition, \nwherein the multi- laminar electrospun nanofiber scaffold is \nconfigured to be applied to the tissue substrate containing the defect,  \nwherein the multi- laminar electrospun nanofiber scaffold \ncomprises varying dens ity to be sufficiently flexible \nto facilitate application of the multi- laminar \nelectrospun nanofiber scaffold to uneven surfaces of the tissue substrate, and  \nwherein the multi- laminar electrospun nanofiber scaffold \ncomprises varying density to be sufficiently flexible to enable movement of the multi- laminar electrospun \nnanofiber scaffold by the tissue substrate.  \n(emphasis added).  Independent claims 8 and 15 likewise require \u201c a first layer formed by a first \nplurality of deposited electrospun polymeric fibe rs\u201d and \u201ca second layer formed by a second \nplurality of deposited electrospun polymeric fibers, wherein the second layer is combined with the \nfirst layer .\u201d      \n \n \n8 \n \n The parties \u2019 joint claim construction brief presented disputes over the ter ms \u201cfirst \nlayer\u201d/\u201csecon d layer\u201d as well as \u201cmulti- laminar .\u201d  Defendant s contended that the \u201cfirst \nlayer\u201d/\u201csecond layer\u201d terms  should be construed to require that each  is \u201ca distinct layer \ndistinguishable from other layers\u201d  and that \u201cmulti- laminar\u201d should be construed to mean \u201ca \nplurality of distinct layers.\u201d   (D.I. 1 20 at 11 .)  Plaintiff s did not propose constructions for any of \nthose terms  and instead took the position that  \u201cno construction [was] necessary.\u201d  ( Id.)   \nAfter carefully reviewing the briefs, and after a lengthy interchange at the hearing, it \nbecame clear to me that  constructions  were necessary.  T he parties had real dispute s about claim \nscope and \u2014contrary to Plaintiff s\u2019 proposal  to not construe anything and put  it to the jury \u2014the \ndispute s needed to be resolved by the Court.   O2 Micro Int \u2019l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., \n521 F.3d 1351, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\u201cWhen the parties present a fundamental dispute regarding \nthe scope of a claim term, it is the court \u2019s duty to resolve it.\u201d).  As became evident  during the \nhearing, t he fundamental dispute concerns  what the word \u201clayer\u201d means and how one distinguishes \nbetween  layers.   (Tr. at 23 -70.)  B ecause the claims require a \u201cfirst layer\u201d and a \u201csecond layer,\u201d \none needs to know what a  \u201clayer\u201d is so that  one can figure out if a particular device has two of \nthem .  I instructed  the parties to meet and confer to try to come up with an agreed-upon \nconstruction or, failing that, to at least talk to each other about the  nature of the dispute and propose \ncompeting constructions that actually reflect what the dispute is about. \n After their post -hearing meet and confer, the parties filed a joint letter indicating their \nagreement that the term  \u201cmulti-laminar\u201d should be construed as \u201cmultiple layers.\u201d   (D.I. 136  at 1.)  \nBut they still have a dispute over the terms \u201cfirst layer\u201d and \u201csecond layer.\u201d  Defendants say that each \u201cfirst layer\u201d and \u201csecond layer\u201d must be a \u201cdistinct and separately deposited  thickness of    \n \n \n9 \n \n material.\u201d  ( Id.)  Plaintiffs say that \u201cfirst layer\u201d and \u201csecond layer\u201d should be construed as \u201cfirst \nthickness of material\u201d and \u201csecond thickness of material.\u201d  (Id.) \nI agree with Defendants and recommend adopting a modified version of Defendants\u2019 \nproposal.  The main problem with Plaintiff s\u2019 proposal is that it does not resolve the dispute between \nthe parties about what a layer is.  How does an accused infringer know if it s product  has two layers \nor one layer and is therefore infringing or not?  Take an ordinary scouring pad, for example.  One \ncould draw an imaginary  horizontal cross section through it and therefore imagin e that it has a first \ntop \u201cthickness of material\u201d and a second bottom \u201cthickness of material ,\u201d which a jury might find \nmeets Plaintiff s\u2019 propos ed construction.   \n \nBut no one , not even Plaintiff s, would say that an ordinary  (single -layer ) scouring pad has two \nlayers .  (Id. (Plaintiff s: \u201c[I]t is understood the [claimed] multiple layers cannot be the same \nlayer. \u201d).) \n One possible solution would be to define a \u201clayer \u201d of material with reference to the fact \nthat it has different properties than its neighboring layers.  For example, a  layer might consist of a \ndifferent polymer, density, or fiber orientation than a neighboring layer.  Sticking with the same \nanalogy, imagine a dish sponge with a spongy side  and a scouring pad side .  Everyone would agree \n   \n \n \n10 \n \n that it has two layers  because the spongy side and the scouring pad side have different physical \nchara cteristics .   \n \nBut defining the meaning of  layer by reference to its physical characteristics  won\u2019t work  for this \npatent  because both si des agree that the claimed \u201cfirst layer\u201d and \u201csecond layer\u201d can have the same \nphysical c haracteristics.  ( Id. at 1, 3; Tr. at 44.)  \n Given that everyone agrees  that we need some objective way of defining where one layer \nstops and the next starts ( i.e., we agree that an ordinary scouring pad only has one layer) , and \neveryone agrees  that something can have two layers even though the two layers have the same \nphysical characteristics,  what makes  a \u201cfirst layer \u201d and a \u201csecond layer\u201d within the meaning of the \nclaims?   The best answer \u2014the one that \u201cstays true to the claim language and most naturally a ligns \nwith the patent\u2019s description of the invention,\u201d  Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa' per Azioni , 158 \nF.3d 1243, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1998) \u2014is that the layers are formed  separately  from each other .  \nDefendant s try to capture that idea with its proposed construction that each layer be \u201cdist inct and \nseparately deposited .\u201d   \nThe claim  language itself  provide s substantial support for Defendants\u2019 proposal .  Not only \ndo the  claims  require  \u201ca first layer formed by a first pl urality of deposited electrospun polymeric \nfibers \u201d and \u201c a second layer formed by a second plurality of deposited electrospun polymeric \nfibers ,\u201d they also require that \u201c the second layer is combined with the first layer \u201d (emphasis added).   \n   \n \n \n11 \n \n That language  suggests that the first layer  must be distinct in the sense that it was formed  \nseparately, independent from the second layer .  That  understanding is consistent with the \nembodiments disclosed in the  specification, which describe ways of \u201ccombin[ing] \u201d layers \u201cto \ncreate a multi -layer biomedical patch ,\u201d including by creating a first layer and depositing a second \nlayer on top, or separately creating a second layer and \u201coverla[ying] \u201d it on the first  layer : \nFIG. 8 is an illustration of a biomedical patch lay er 400 with a \nplurality of randomly oriented fibers 405 and a biomedical patch \nlayer 410 with a plurality of radially aligned fibers 415. As shown in FIG. 8, biomedical patch layers 400 and 410 may be combined (e.g., overlaid) to produce a multi -layer biom edical patch 420 with \nboth randomly oriented fibers 405 and radially aligned fibers 415, or any other combination of any number or type of fiber layers.  \n. . . . In some embodiments, multiple biomedical patch layers 410 with radially aligned fibers 415 may be combined to create a multi -layer \nbiomedical patch. For example, referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, after depositing a first set of fibers on collector 105, one may wait for the first set of fibers 165 to solidify completely or cure and then deposit a second set of fibers 165 on collector 105. The second set of fibers 165 may be deposited directly over the first set of fibers 165 on \ncollector 105. Alternatively, the first set of fibers 165 may be removed from collector 105, and the second set of fibers 165 may be deposited on conductive surface 162 and/or collector 105 and then removed and overlaid on the first set of fibers 165.  \n(\u02bc512 patent, 12:60- 67, 13: 13-25.)   \nPlaintiff s take issue with the word \u201cdistinct\u201d in Defendants\u2019  proposed construction.  \nAccording to Plaintiff s, the word \u201c\u2018distinct\u2019 would only add ambiguity and confuse the jury\u201d \nbecause \u201cthe parties have agreed the layers do not need to be different in their composition, \nstructure or other characteristics .\u201d  (D.I. 136 at 1.)  But that concern can be addressed by adding \nclarifying language to the construction, like  the following: \u201c The first layer and the second layer  do    \n \n \n12 \n \n not need to be different in their composition, structure, or other characteristics.\u201d  Should a par ty \ndesire clarifying language , the parties should meet and confer and submit an agreed -upon proposal. \nPlaintiffs also take issue with a construction that imposes a requirement that each layer be \n\u201cseparately deposited.\u201d  Plaintiffs argue, among other things , that a \u201cseparately deposited\u201d \nrequirement would erroneously import a process limitation into the claim.  I disagree.  The Federal \nCircuit rejected a similar argument in Regents of University of Minnesota v. AGA Medical Corp., \n717 F.3d 929, 938 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  The claim there  required \u201cfirst and second occluding disks\u201d \nwith \u201ca central portion of the membrane of the first disk being affixed to a central portion of the membrane of the second disk to define a conjoint disk.\u201d  Id.  at 934.  The  Federal Circuit affirmed \nthe district court\u2019s conclusion that the claim language \u201ccover[ed] only a device made up of two physically separate disks that are attached to one another. \u201d  Id.  at 935.  The court  rejected the \npatentee\u2019s argument that  the construction improperly incorporated a process limitation, reasoning \nthat \u201cwords like \u2018affixed\u2019 or \u2018conjoint,\u2019 which when read in context describe the product more by \nits structure than by the process used to obtain it, are product limitations, not process limita tions.\u201d  \nId. at 938 (cleaned up) .  It further stated that \u201c[w]hen a patentee ch ooses to use these words, they \nshould be given their ordinary meanings with respect to the claimed product\u2019s structure.\u201d  Id.   \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The claim requi res that the \u201cfirst layer\u201d and the \u201csecond \nlayer\u201d are each made from \u201cdeposited electrospun polymeric fibers\u201d and that the two layers must \nbe \u201ccombined\u201d with each other.  One  could not be said to \u201ccombine\u201d two things that did not exist \nseparately before th ey were combined.   Construing the terms to mean that, before combining, the \nlayers exist ed separately does no more than give ordinary meaning to the claim language.  \nAccordingly, the  \u201cseparately deposited\u201d language is  an appropriate structural limitation that solves    \n \n \n13 \n \n the problem of distinguishing between single -layer products and multi -layer products where the \nlayers have the same composition.  \n Plaintiff s also contend that a \u201cseparately deposited\u201d requirement is inconsistent with certain  \nembodiments  disclosed in the specification .  Plaintiff s point out that  the \u02bc512 specification \ndiscloses  an embodiment where a \u201csingle layer \u201d is created by \u201csimultaneously, sequentially and/or \nalternately \u201d depositing radially aligned and non- radially aligned fibers.  ( \u02bc512 patent, 12:52- 54.)  \nBut the  mere  fact that the specification says that a single layer might  be made  from  differently -\naligned fibers  deposited sequentially does not suggest , as Plaintiff s contend, that a single  deposit \nof fibers could form a claimed  \u201cfirst layer\u201d and a \u201csecond layer\u201d that have been  \u201ccombined\u201d with \neach other.  The claim language itself requires  that the layers must be created  separately  and \ncombined. \n Plaintiff s further argue  that Defendants\u2019 construction is improper because it \u201c excludes any \npost-electrospinning modifications to the product in a determination of whether the product \ncontains the claimed \u2018layers .\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 136 at 2.)  Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, to the ext ent I understand it, \nis that Defendants \u2019 proposed construction would exclude a product with  \u201clayers\u201d that are defined  \nnot by \u201ccombin[ing] \u201d separate deposits , but by doing some other type of physical  modification to \na single deposit that would result in some of the fibers having different physical characteristics than other fibers .  But P laintiffs do not point t o anywhere in the specification that refers to such  \nmodifications as creating layers.  More imp ortantly, the claim s require that the layers be \n\u201ccombined.\u201d  If Plaintiff s\u2019 point  is that Defendants\u2019 proposed construction excludes a device with \nlayers that weren\u2019t created separately  and combined , then I agree, it does , and appropriately so.      \n \n \n14 \n \n  To be clear, the Court\u2019s construction is not intended to exclude any of the disclosed ways \nthat the layers may be combined .  Again, the specification explains  that a multi- layer patch may \nbe formed, for example, by creating a first layer and depositing a second layer on top, or by \nseparately  creating the layers and then overlaying them.  The Court\u2019s construction is intended to \nbe broad enough to cover both.  Should either side  desire clarifying language in the construction \nto make that clear , the parties  should meet and confer and propose language. \nAccordingly, I recommend that the Court adopt Defendants\u2019 proposed construction and \nconsider adopting any clarifying language proposed by the parties that is consistent with the above \ndiscussion. \nB. \u02bc687 patent: \u201cfirst layer \u201d / \u201csecond layer\u201d / \u201cthird layer\u201d  \nThe second group of disputed terms are \u201cfirst layer\u201d/\u201csecond layer\u201d/\u201cthird layer,\u201d found in \nclaims 1, 5, and 7 of the \u02bc687 patent.  Independent claim 1 provides:  \n1. A structure for use in repairing a defect in a substrate, the \nstructure comprising:  \na first layer formed by a first plurality of polymeric fibers ; \nand \na second layer formed by a second plurality of polymeric \nfibers, the second layer coupled to the first layer \nusing a first coupling process , the second layer \nhaving a plurality of densities formed by the second plurality of polymeric fibers, wherein the first and second layers are configured to separate after at least one of a predetermined time and an environmental condition and wherein the struct ure is configured to \nbe applied to the substrate containing the defect.     \n \n \n15 \n \n (emphasis added).2  Dependent claim 7 provides:  \n7. A structure in accordance with claim 1, further comprising \na third layer that is coupled to the first and second layers using the \nfirst coupling process . \n(emphasis added).   \nThe dispute here is essentially the same as the previous dispute.  Defendants say that each \nof the \u201cfirst layer,\u201d \u201csecond layer,\u201d and \u201cthird layer\u201d must be a \u201cdistinct and separately deposited \nthickness of material.\u201d   Plaintiffs say that each is  a \u201cfirst /second/third thickness of material.\u201d3  I \nagain agree with Defendants.   \nHere, again, the  claim language suggests that each layer must be distinct in the sense that \nit must be created  separately  and joined with the  other  layers  through a coupling process .  The \nclaim language is  consistent with the specification, which describes \u201ccoupling\u201d separately -created \nlayers togethe r: \nIn the exemplary embodiment, method 700 includes electrically \ncharging 705 collector 105 at a first amplitude and/or polarity (e.g., negatively charging or grounding). Spinneret 120 is electrically charged 710 at a second amplitude and/or polarity opposite the first amplitude and/or polarity (e.g., positively charged). A polymer (e.g., a liquid polymer) is dispensed 715 from spinneret 120. In the exemplary embodiment, dispensed 715 polymers are collected 720 on collector 105 to form a plurality of polymeric fibers on or substantially near features 112 that creates a structure or patch. After \nthe d ispensed 615 polymers are collected 720 and a structure is \ncreated, the structure may undergo post -processing 725. Such post -\nprocessing 725 can include, but is not limited to, lamination, layer \n \n \n2 Claim 5 is dependent on claim 1, and it specifies that \u201cthe first layer and second layer \nare configured to be  applied to biological tissue.\u201d   \n \n3 Prior to the Markman hearing, Plaintiff s took the position that \u201c[n]o construction was \nnecessary.\u201d  (D.I. 120 at 29.)  The parties presented their current positions after a post -hearing \nmeet and confer.  (D.I. 136.)      \n \n \n16 \n \n stacking, coupling and/or fusing, chemically treating, and applying \na biological agent, growth factor, and/or drug.  \nFIG. 15 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 750 for fusing or coupling together structures or patch layers produced by method 700 shown in FIG. 14. Method 750 includes providing 755 a first, second, a nd third patch layer. First patch layer is coupled 760 to \nsecond patch layer using a first coupling technique. The coupled 760 first and second layers are then coupled 765 to the third patch layer using a second coupling technique different than the first coupling technique. In the exemplary embodiment, coupling techniques, include but are not limited to, heating, applying mechanical stress/pressure, chemical processing, cross -linking, and \nfunctionalization. While method 750 illustrates a first patch layer coupled to a second patch layer, it should be noted that multiple layers (e.g., 3, 5, 6,) can be coupled together simultaneously. Additionally, the process may be repeated to add layers to structures produced by method 750.  \n \n(\u02bc687 patent, 11: 62-12:26, Fig. 15.)   \nI recommend that the Court adopt Defendants\u2019 proposed construction and consider  \nadopting any clarifying language proposed by the parties that is consistent with the above \ndiscussion. \n   \n \n \n17 \n \n C. \u02bc444 patent: \u201cfirst plurality \u201d / \u201csecond plurality \u201d \nThe third group of disputed terms are \u201cfirst plur ality\u201d and \u201csecond plurality,\u201d  found in \nclaims 1 -8, 10, 16 and 17 of the \u02bc 444 patent.  Only claim 1 is independent.  It recites:  \n1. A three -dimensional electrospun nanofiber scaffold for \nuse in repairing a defect in  a tissue substrate, the three- dimensional \nelectrospun nanofiber scaffold comprising:  \na first plurality of electrospun polymeric nanofibers  having   \na diameter of 1 -3000 nanometers; and  \na second plurality of deposited electrospun polymeric  \nnanofibers  having a diameter of 1- 3000 nanometers, \nthe second plurality of deposited electrospun polymeric \nnanofibers being coupled to the first plurality of \nelectrospun polymeric nanofibers , \nthe secon d plurality of deposited electrospun polymeric \nnanofibers forming one or more regions within the three- dimensional electrospun nanofiber scaffold, \nwherein the one or more regions comprise a density different from one or more other regions of the three -\ndime nsional electrospun nanofiber scaffold, wherein \nthe one or more regions are overlaid on a first portion of the first plurality of electrospun polymeric nanofibers, wherein the one or more regions are not overlaid on a second portion of the first plurality of \nelectrospun polymeric nanofibers,  \nwherein the three- dimensional electrospun nanofiber \nscaffold is configured to be applied to the tissue substrate containing the defect,  \nwherein the three- dimensional electrospun nanofiber \nscaffold comprises a controlled  separation rate of \nless than 30 days, wherein the first plurality of electrospun polymeric nanofibers and the second plurality of deposited electrospun polymeric nanofibers are adapted to separate within 30 days after application to the tissue substrate c ontaining the \ndefect.     \n \n \n18 \n \n Claim 2 contains the additional limitation that the \u201cfirst plurality and \u201csecond plurality\u201d are \n\u201ccoupled . . . by at least one of heating, applying mechanical stress, applying mechanical pressure, \napplying a glue, chemical processing, cross -linking, or surface functionalization.\u201d  Claim 6 \nrequires that th e coupling occur by \u201ccross -linking.\u201d  The \u02bc444 patent has the same specification as \nthe \u02bc687 patent.  \nThe dispute here is essentially the same as  the previous dispute, except that the \u02bc 444 patent \nclaims refer to a first and second \u201cplurality\u201d instead of a first and second \u201clayer.\u201d   Defendants say \nthat \u201cfirst plurality\u201d and \u201csecond plurality\u201d should be construed as \u201cfirst distinct and separately \ndeposited thickness\u201d and \u201csecond distinct a nd separately deposited thickness.\u201d  Plaintiffs say they \nshould be construed as \u201cfirst/second grouping of two or more [electrospun polymeric fibers].\u201d4   \nOne dispute between the parties is whether the claimed first and second pluralities must be \n\u201cdistinct\u201d and \u201cseparately deposited ,\u201d as Defendant s propose .  For the same reasons set forth \nabove, I again agree with Defendant s.  Like claim 1 of the \u02bc 687 patent, claim 1 of the \u02bc444 patent \nsuggest s that the first plurality of fibers must be distinct and separately deposited .  It requires  that \nthe second plurality of electrospun polymeric nanofibers  be \u201ccoupled\u201d  to the first plurality.  It  also \nrequires  that one or more regions of the second pluralit y be \u201c overlaid \u201d on a portion of the first \nplurality.  Th ose requirements  make clear that each claimed plurality of fibers is separately created  \nand then combined together.  And that understanding is consistent  with the same portions of the \nspecification of the related \u02bc 687 patent cited in the section above . \n \n \n4 Prior to the Markman hearing, Plaintiff s took the position that \u201c[n]o construction was \nnecessary.\u201d  (D.I. 120 at 31.)  The parties presented their current positions after a post -hearing \nmeet and confer.  (D.I. 136.)     \n \n \n19 \n \n The parties also dispute whether the construction should use the word \u201cthickness,\u201d as \nDefendants propose, or the word \u201cgrouping\u201d as Plaintiff s propose.   The int rinsic evidence does \nnot strongly point one way or the other.  Nor has either side explained how choosing between \n\u201cthickness\u201d and \u201cgrouping\u201d will resolve anything at issue in the litigation .  It s eems to me that any \n\u201cgrouping\u201d  of objects made out of atoms will by definition have a \u201c thickness .\u201d  That said, the \nclaims only require a \u201cplurality,\u201d which is commonly understood to mean two or more , and the  \nterm \u201cthickness\u201d might lead the jury to believe that something more is required .  I suggest going \nwith \u201c grouping.\u201d    \nAccordingly, I recommend that the terms \u201cfirst plurality\u201d and \u201csecond plurality\u201d be \nconstrued as  \u201cfirst distinct and separately deposited grouping [of electrospun polymeric \nnanofibers] \u201d and \u201csecond distinct and separately deposited grouping [of electrospun polymeric \nnanofibers].\u201d  As before , I also recommend that the Court consider adopting any clarifying \nlanguage proposed by the parties that is consistent with the above discussion. \nIII. DEFENDANTS\u2019  PATEN TS \nDefendants are asserting  two patents against Plaintiff s: U.S. Patent No. 8,222,166 (the \n\u201c\u02bc166 patent \u201d), titled \u201cHigh Flux and Low Fouling Filtration Media,\u201d  which has two phrases to be \nconstrued, and U .S. Patent No. 7,172,765 (the \u201c\u02bc 765 patent \u201d), titled \u201cBiodegradable and/or \nBioabsorbable Fibrous Articles and Methods for Using the Articles for Medical Applications,\u201d  \nwhich has one phrase to be construed.  \nA. \u02bc166 patent: \u201cprepared from at least one solution of at least one polymer \nutilizing a process  selected from the group consisting of electro -spinning, \nelectro -blowing, blowing -assisted electro -spinning, and solution blowing \u201d \nThe next  disputed phrase is \u201cprepared from at least one solution of at least one polymer \nutilizing a process selected from th e group consisting of electro- spinning, electro -blowing,    \n \n \n20 \n \n blowing- assisted electro -spinning, and solution blowing,\u201d  found in claim 26 of the  \u02bc166 patent.   \nClaim 26 depends on claim 23, and they recite as follows:  \n23. An article comprising a nanofibrous scaffold \ncomprising: fibers having a diameter of from about 1 nm to about \n20,000 nm; voids with an effective diameter of from about 2 nm to \nabout 200 \u03bcm; and a thickness of from about 1 \u03bcm to about 500 \u03bcm.  \n26. The article of  claim 23  wherein th e nanofibrous scaffold \ncomprises at least one layer prepared from at least one solution of \nat least one polymer utilizing a process selected from the group \nconsisting of electro -spinning, electro- blowing, blowing- assisted \nelectro -spinning, and solution blowing.  \n(emphasis added).  \n Plaintiffs argue  that th e disputed phrase is a process limitation of a product -by-process \nclaim.  Defendants argue that the phrase is not a process limitation of a product -by-process claim.   \nA \u201c\u2018product -by-process\u2019 . . . claim \u2018is one in which the product is defined at least in part in \nterms of the method or process by which it is made. \u2019\u201d  Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, \nInc., 489 U.S. 141, 159 n. * (1989)  (quoting Donald S. Chisum, Chisum on Patents: A Treatise on \nthe Law of Patentability, Validity and Infringement \u00a7 8.05 (1988) ); see also Abbott Labs . v. Sandoz, \nInc., 566 F.3d 1282, 1291 -94 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that product claims with  process limitations \nare only infringed by products made by the claimed process es).   \nThe parties are not asking the Court to construe  the \u201cprepared from\u201d phrase ; they merely  \nwant the Court to rule on whether it is a process limitation  of a product -by-process claim .  Even \nafter hearing oral argumen t, it is still not clear to me what the point of the parties\u2019 dispute is , or \nwhether resolving it might  actually  affect the outcome of the case one way or the other .  (See Tr. \n70-92.)  However, because characterizing something as a product -by-process claim  can affect the    \n \n \n21 \n \n invalidity analysis ,5 I do not think it is inappropriate to resolve this dispute as part of the claim \nconstruction process.  See  In re Biogen \u02bc755 Pat ent Litig. , No. 10- 2734, 2016 WL 7340311, at *5 \n(D.N.J. Mar. 28, 2016) (collecting cases ) (\u201cAs part of the claim construction process, courts are \nroutinely tasked with making determinations that are not strictly limited to the technical meaning \nof claim terms and limitations. \u201d). \n I agree with Plaintiffs that the disputed phrase is a process limitation  of a product -by-\nprocess claim.  Claim 26 covers an \u201carticle\u201d and  is thus  a product claim.  The phrase \u201c at least one \nlayer prepared from at least one solution of at least one polymer utilizing a process selected from \nthe group consisting of electro- spinning, electro -blowing, blowing- assisted electro -spinning, and \nsolution blowing\u201d  describes  how the claimed \u201clayer\u201d must be prepared and is clearly a process \nlimitation .  See Biaco re v. Thermo Bioanalysis Corp., 79 F. Supp. 2d 422, 456 (D. Del. 1999) \n(\u201cTypically, it is the wording of the claim which indicates that it is a product- by-process claim. \nFor example, product -by-process claims employ terms such as \u2018prepared in accordance wi th,\u2019 \n[and]  \u2018by the process of \u2019 . . . .\u201d).  C laim 26 is a product claim with a process limitation; thus, it is \na product -by-process claim.   \n The cases cited by Defendants do not support their position.  Those cases stand for the \nproposition that when claim phrases  \u201cconnote with equal force a structural characteristic of the \nproduct or a process of manufacture,\u201d it is usually appropriate to interpret them \u201cin their structural \nsense.\u201d  See 3M Innovative Props.

In addition, the disputed phrase  actually uses \nthe word \u201cprocess \u201d to refer to how the claimed layers have to be prepared.    \n I recommend that the Court hold that t he disputed phrase is a process limitation of a \nproduct -by-process claim.   \nB. \u02bc166 patent: prepared from about 1 to about 5 solutions of from about 1 to \nabout 5 polymers \u201d \nThe next disputed phrase is found in claim 27 of Defendants\u2019 \u02bc166 patent.  It depends on \nclaim 23, and it provides:  \n 27.  The article of claim 26 wherein the nanofibrous scaffold \ncomprises from about 1 to about 5 layers prepared from about 1 to \nabout 5 solutions of from about 1 to about 5 polymers . \n(emphasis added).     \n \n \n23 \n \n Plaintiffs argue that the  phrase \u201cprepared f rom about 1 to about 5 solutions of from about \n1 to about 5 polymers \u201d is a process limitation of a product -by-process claim.  Defendants say  it is \nnot.   \nThis is essentially the same dispute as the previous  dispute.  I agree with Plaintiffs for the \nsame reasons.   I recommend that the Court hold that the disputed phrase is a process limitation of \na product -by-process claim.   \nC. \u02bc765 patent: \u201cformed by electros pinning fibers \u201d \n The final disputed phrase is \u201c formed by electrospinning fibers ,\u201d found in claims 1 and 49 \nof the \u02bc765 patent .  They  provide :  \n1. A biodegradable and/or bioabsorbable fibrous article \nformed by electrospinning fibers  of biodegradable and/or \nbioabsorbable fiberizable material comprising a composite of \ndifferent biodegradable and/or bioabsorbable fibers. \n49. A fibrous article formed by electrospinning different \nfibers of different materials, comprising a composite of different \nfibers which comprises fibers of at least one biodegradable material and fibers of at least one non- biodegradable material.  \n(emphasis added).  \nPlaintiffs argue that \u201cformed by electrospinning fibers \u201d is a process limitation of a product -\nby-process claim.  Defendants say it is not.\n6   \nIf, instead, the disputed phrase was \u201celectrospun fibers,\u201d Defendants might have had an \nargument that the phrase connotes structure .  But the  claimed  \u201cformed by electrospinning fibers\u201d \n \n \n6 The parties haven\u2019t asked the Court to determine whether the preamble of either claim \nis limiting.     \n \n \n24 \n \n clearly refers to a process.  Accordingly, I agree with Plaintiffs, and I recommend that the Court \nhold that the disputed phrase is a process limitation of a product-by- process claim . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nI recommend that the Court  adopt the constructions set forth above .  Should either side \ndesire to include clarifying language consistent with the above analysis for the \u201c first \nlayer\u201d/\u201c second  layer\u201d/\u201c third layer \u201d terms or the \u201c first plurality\u201d /\u201csecond  plurality \u201d terms , the \nparties should meet and confer and file a joint status letter within  fourteen days.   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B),  (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.
