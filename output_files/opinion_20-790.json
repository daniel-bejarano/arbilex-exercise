Andrews  \nANDREWS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore me is Defendant  Brightlamp\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  (D.I. \n16).  I have considered the parties \u2019 briefing on the issue.  (D.I. 17, 19, 21).  For the following \nreasons, Brightlamp\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff Sober -Eye sued Brightlamp for infringement of Sober -Eye\u2019s Patent No. \n9,888,845 (the \u2019 845 patent).  (D.I. 14).  The \u20198 45 patent describes a system and method of \ndetecting cognitive impairment by analyzing a pupil\u2019s response to light on a device such as a \nsmartphone.  ( \u2019845 p atent at 1:58 -68).  Sober -Eye asserts at least claims 1, 3, 14, 17, and 25 of \nthe \u2019845 patent.  (D. I. 14 at \u00b6\u00b6 30- 32).   \nIndependent method claim 1 recites:  \nA method comprising:  \n \ncapturing video of an eye exposed to light stimuli over a predetermined time using a video camera of a portable video capture device (PVCD);  \n processing the video to locate at least one feature of the eye;  \n measuring a change in the feature over the predetermined time in response to the light stimuli;  \n analyzing data from the measured change in the feature, wherein analyzing data includes extracting data from the measured change in the feature, calculating a number of parameters from the extracted data, correlating the calculated parameters against predetermined reference parameters and predicting a degree of cognitive impairment based on the results of the correlation; and \n outputting through a user interface in the portable video capture device the degree of impairment to a user.  \n The other asserted claims (both method and system) are very similar in the way each \ndescribes the steps to capture and process video data of an eye\u2019s response to light.  Page 3 of 7  \n II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nSection 101 of the Patent Act defines patent -eligible subject matter.  It provides: \n\u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or \ncomposition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent the refor, \nsubject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  The Supreme Court recognizes three categories of subject matter that are not eligible for patents \u2014laws of nature, \nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas.  Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , 573 U.S. 208, 216 \n(2014).   \nTo distinguish \u201c patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas \nfrom those that claim patent- eligible applications of those concepts,\u201d the court first determines \nwhether the claims are drawn to a patent -ineligible concept.  Id.  at 217.  If the answer is yes, the \ncourt must look to \u201cthe elements of the claim both individually and as an ordered combination\u201d to see if there is an \u201cinventive concept \u2014i.e. , an element or combination of elements that is \nsufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\u201d  Id.  at 217- 18 (cleaned up).  \u201cA claim that recites an abstract idea \nmust include additional features to ensure tha t the claim is more than a drafting effort designed to \nmonopolize the abstract idea.\u201d  Id.  at 221 (cleaned up).  Further, \u201cthe mere recitation of a generic \ncomputer cannot transform a patent -ineligible abstract idea into a patent -eligible invention.\u201d  Id.   \nat 223.   \nPatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is a threshold legal issue.  Bilski v. Kappos , 561 U.S. \n593, 602 (2010) .  Accordingly, the \u00a7 101 inquiry is properly raised at the pleading stage if it is \napparent from the face of the patent that the asserted  claims are not directed to eligible subject \nmatter.  See Cleveland Clinic Found. v. True Health Diagnostics LLC , 859 F.3d 1352, 1360 Page 4 of 7  \n (Fed. Cir. 2017), cert. denied , 138 S. Ct. 2621 (2018) .  This is, however, appropriate \u201conly when \nthere are no factual allegations that, taken as true, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a \nmatter of law.\u201d  Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 2018).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThe parties dispute both prongs of the Alice test.  I find that the complaint has plausibly \npled an inventive concept in the use of a smartphone or similar device to detect a degree of cognitive impairment based on pupillary light reflex at Alice step two .\n1  Thus, I  need not and do \nnot decide whether the patents are directed to an abstract idea at Alice step one.   \n      Brightlamp  argues that the claims are not directed toward an improvement in computer \ntechnology and do not otherwise disclose an inventive concept.  (D.I. 17 at 16- 20).  Sober -Eye\u2019s \nAmended Complaint, though, alleges , \u201cas of the date of the patent\u2019s application, no way existed \nto make a smartphone or tablet device identify key features of the human eye, make minute measurements in response to light, or analyze a level of impairment.\u201d  (D.I. 14 at \u00b6 11).  Thus, Sober -Eye argues, the claimed technology improves the ope ration of a smartphone and allows \nfor \u201cthe tangible and useful prediction of a degree of impairment.\u201d  (D.I. 19 at 14, 17).   \nI do not think that the claimed technology improves the operation of a smartphone in the \nsense that the Court of Appeals uses to describe improvements to computer technology.  The \n \n1 The parties dispute whether the technology for determining impairment was well -known and \nunderstood at the time of the invention.  Plaintiff argues that Defendant is inferring a lack of \ninventiveness in this regard from the absence of allegations in the A mended Complaint.  (D.I. 19 \nat 14).  I do not see anything in the Amended Complaint or the asserted patent that suggests there is any inventiveness in regard to how to determine impairment using a machine that examines the eyes.  If that were Plaintiff\u2019s theory, Plaintiff would have to make the requisite allegations, which it does not.  If this were the issue, I would at least let Plaintiff make a motion to be allowed to amend its complaint.   Page 5 of 7  \n invention does not improve cameras in a smartphone .  It does not improve processing speed , the \nhardware, the way the hardware works, or anything else related to the technology in a \nsmartphone.  But  it does purport to compensate for some inherent limitations of a smartphone \ndue to the smartphone\u2019s portability.   Thus, t he improved operation is simply a useful software \nprogram that does something that software programs for smartphones did not do (or, p erhaps, did \nnot do well) at the time of the invention .  I think these conclusions are entirely consistent with \nwhat the patent itself discloses as the invention.  \u201c The present disclosure relates generally to a \nsystem and method for optical detection of cog nitive impairment, and more particularly to \nan application or software program designed to permit a user to optically detect cognitive impairment using a portable video capture device. \u201d  \u2019845 Pat., 1:14- 18.  \n \u201cThe objective of \nthe invention is to provide a  non-invasive, portable way to measure pupillary light reflex and \nother involuntary eye movements and correlate such measurement to an impairment level that can be associated with fatigue, alcohol, drug consumption or trauma. \u201d  Id.  at 1:57-62. \nI agree with  Sober -Eye that it is plausible that the asserted claims of the patent include an \ninventive concept of using a smartphone or similar device to predict a degree of impairment  by \nwriting a program that can do so on a smartphone.  \nMuch of Brightlamp\u2019s briefing focuses on the level of generality with which the \nspecification describes the invention.  Brightlamp argues , \u201cThe specification of the \u2019845 Patent \nprovides no additional details on the implementation of the claimed invention, or the s pecific \ntiming or measurement of specific pupil properties to determine impairment.\u201d  (D.I. 17 at 18 ).  \nFor instance, Figures 13A and 13B, which are graphs depicting pupil dilation over time, do not have units on the X or Y axe s.  (Id. at 18 -19).    Page 6 of 7  \n Some courts have found a patent\u2019s  disclosure to be so lacking that the  patent\u2019s  subject \nmatter was effectively an abstract idea.  See  Vehicle Intel. & Safety LLC v. Mercedes -Benz USA, \nLLC, 635 F. App'x 914, 917 (Fed. Cir. 2015)  (\u201cMuch of [plaintiff\u2019s] briefing c enters on the use \nof an \u2018 expert system \u2019 that improves over the prior art by providing faster, more accurate and \nreliable impairment testing. But neither the claims at issue nor the specification provide any \ndetails as to how this \u2018 expert system \u2019 works or how it produces faster, more accurate and reliable \nresults. \u201d); Internet Pats. Corp. v. Gen. Auto. Ins. Servs., Inc., 29 F. Supp. 3d 1264, 1269 (N.D. \nCal. 2013), aff'd sub nom. Internet Pats. Corp. v. Active Network, Inc., 790 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2015)  (\u201cThe Court finds that by setting out the  abstract  idea of a known technological challenge \nwithout setting out any specific  disclosures, the  Patent  added no elements or combination of \nelements, sometimes referred to as the inventive concept, sufficient to  ensure that the patent  in \npractice amounts to significantly more than a  patent  upon the natural law or the  abstract  idea. \u201d \n(cleaned up)).   \nUnlike the patents in Mercedes -Benz  and Internet Pats. Corp., where the inventive \nconcept was not supported by \u201cany\u201d  details or specific disclosures, the \u2019845 patent includes  some \nlevel of technical detail  in the specification .  See \u2019845 Pat ., 8:39-9:3.  The specification describes \nalgorithms that allow for the calculation of a level of impairment on a smartphone or other personal video capture device ( \u201cPVCD\u201d ).  The compensation algorithm, for instance, accounts \nfor the effect of a shaky hand in the video recording process : \n[A] compensation algorithm will analyze the change of size of pupil and iris from frame \nto frame. Any change in size of iris is due to PVCD movement only, while changes in pupil size are due to both to [sic] pupil reaction to light stimuli and PVCD movements.  \nThe compensation algorithm will use the change in the size of iris to extrapolate the pupil size change due only to the light stimuli, effectively removing the effect of the PVCD movement from the pupil size measurement and provide an accurate measurement  of \npupil size change due to light stimuli only.  Page 7 of 7  \n Id. at 8:58- 67.  The specification further states  that this is an advance over the prior art.  Id. at \n9:22- 28 (\u201c [I]n prior art approaches to measuring pupil contraction or dilation the camera was \nrequired t o be fixed relative to the eye. In contras t, [the claimed method is] tolerant of movement \nduring the predetermined time in which video is captured.\u201d).  \nBrightlamp may ultimately be right about the sparse disclosure, but at this stage it \nappears  that Brightl amp\u2019s arguments  go more to patentability than eligibility.  See Bascom Glob. \nInternet Servs., Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Newman, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cClaims that are . . . unsupported by description or that are not enable d raise \nquestions of patentability, not eligibility.\u201d) .  Sober -Eye has alleged enough to plausibly plead \nthat the \u2019845 patent contains an inventive concept that was not \u201cwell -understood, routine, or \nconventional \u201d in the field.  Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Gre en Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, \n1128 (Fed. Cir. 2018) .  I will therefore deny Brightlamp\u2019s motion to dismiss.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will issue.  \n \n "}
