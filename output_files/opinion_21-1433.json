It must be adapted to fit the facts. \nThat is what should have happened here.  \nBanks must tell their clients a lot of  information. To make that easier,  the federal \ngovernment publishes templates for them  to use . One of those tem plates included the \nmost common -sense definition of \u201coverdrafting\u201d a bank account. Del-One used that \ndefinition in the notice it gave to clients. But Del -One understands overdrafting more \nbroad ly than that , so the template \u2019s definition did not describe its  policy  clearly . Be-\ncause Del-One did not adapt the template  accordingly, it may have violated a federal \nregulation  and committed fraud. So I let the claim s against it proceed.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nJoanne Miller opened a checking account with Del -One. Compl., D.I. 1  \u00b6 24. When \nshe did, Del -One had her sign a n opt -in notice about its overdraft policy. Id.  \u00b6 47.  \nUnder that policy, Del -One customers can \u201coverdraft\u201d their accounts in two  ways. \nIf someone buys something without enough money in her  account, Del -One may pay \nout of its own pocket, then charge a fee for that small \u201cloan.\u201d Id. \u00b6 19.  \nBut sometimes, Del -One charges a fee even when the customer has enough money. \nThat  is because i t considers  future payments , like  a monthly water bill or mortgage \npaymen t. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 40\u201344. Subtracting out those upcoming bills, Del -One calculates the \ncustomer\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d money. Id.  If she spends more than that , Del -One charges her \nan overdraft fee \u2014even  if she  deposits  the money to cover the future payments and \nDel-One never shells out anything. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 40\u201344, 59.  3 Under a federal regulation, Del -One must  clearly explain in its opt -in notice the \nreasons it charges overdraft fees. Id.  \u00b6 46. But Miller found that notice ambiguous : \nshe did not know that the bank factored in upcoming bills when deciding whether she \nhad enough money in her account. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 5, 57\u2013 60. Upset, she brought a class action \nagainst Del -One for violating the regulation and Delaware\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act. Id.  \n\u00b6\u00b6 2, 78 \u201392. \nNow Del -One has moved to dismiss both claims. D.I. 7. At this stage, I take Mil-\nler\u2019s complaint as true and ask whether h er claims are plausible. Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007).  They are.  \nII. MILLER \u2019S REGULATORY CLAIM IS PLAUSIBLE  \nMiller says that because Del-One\u2019s opt -in notice did not explain its  overdraft policy \nclearly , Del-One has violate d a federal re gulation. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  78\u201384. Del-One suggests \nthat I should not  judge  the text of that notic e in isolation . Even if that notice was \nambiguous, Del -One says, two other documents that it gave Miller clearly explained \nits overdraft  policy . D.I. 8, at 2 \u20136.  \nBut I cannot consider those documents. They are not integral to Miller\u2019s com-\nplaint . See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. , 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. \n1997). Indeed, she does not even mention them.  \nNor could they be integral , even if she had . Under t he federal regulation Miller \nflags,  Del-One must provide customers with \u201ca notice in writing  \u2026 segregated from \nall other information, describing [its]  overdraft service.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7  1005.17(b)(1)(i) \n(emphasis added). Thus, all releva nt information about Del -One\u2019s overdraft policy \nmust be in that one \u201cseparate []\u201d document. Segregate (def. A.2), The Oxford English 4 Dictionary (2d ed. 2000). Information in other documents is \u201cirrelevant to whether  \u2026 \nthe segregated document [] adequately explains [Del -One\u2019s] overdraft policy.\u201d Grenier \nv. Granite State Credit Union , 2021 WL 5177709, at *3 (D.N.H. Nov. 8, 2021); accord \nFludd v. S. State Bank , 566 F.  Supp.  3d 471, at 482\u201383 (D.S.C. 2021); Adams v. Lib-\nerty Bank , 2021 WL 3726007, at *3 (D. Conn. Aug. 23, 2021). So I will stick to the text \nof the notice itself.  \nA. Del-One\u2019s notice is misleading  \nDel-One\u2019s opt -in notice defines an overdraft as \u201cwhen you do not have enough \nmoney in your account to cover a transaction, but [Del -One] pay[s] it anyway.\u201d D.I. 8 -\n3; Compl. \u00b6  48. Miller reads this definition to mean  that \u201cDel -One uses the actual \nbalance and money in the account to calculate whether an overdraft has occurred\u201d \nwithout factoring in upcoming bills. Id.  \u00b6 49. Understandably so. Ordina ry consumers \nwould likely understand the phrase \u201cdo not have enough money in your account\u201d to refer to a literal shortfall of cash , not the possib ility of  one.  \nSo the notice  does not accurately \u201cdescrib[e] [Del -One\u2019s] overdraft service\u201d in a \n\u201cclear and re adily understandable\u201d way. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7  1005.17(b)(1)(i), 1005.4(a)(1). \nIndeed, many courts have found that similar notices fail to describe this type of over-\ndraft  service clearly . See, e.g. , Tims v. LGE Comm ty. Credit Union , 935 F.3d 1228, \n1243\u2013 44 (11th Cir. 2019); Grenier, 2021 WL 5177709, at *3; Wellington v. Empower \nFed. Credit Union , 533 F. Supp.  3d 64, 70 (N.D.N.Y. 2021).  \nBut wait, Del -One says. It pulled the language in its notice straight from the tem-\nplate  in the regu lation. D.I. 8, at 1 4\u201315; see 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7  1005.17(d) & appx. A -9. Be-\ncause the government surely understands the many reasons financial institutions 5 charge overdraft fees, it must have intended for the template  to cover practices like \nDel-One\u2019s. D.I. 8, at  14\u201315. \nThat argument assumes too much. Perhaps the government intended the tem-\nplate to clearly describe many types of overdraft practices. Perhaps not: Miller\u2019s com-\nplaint casts the regulation as an attempt to crack down on overdraft fees. See Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 25\u201335. The regulation\u2019s text does not point one way or the other. So I cannot pre-\nsume much about the drafters\u2019 intent.  \nImportantly,  the regulation does not require Del-One to quot e the template  ver-\nbatim . It compels only a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d notice. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7  1005.17(d). Indeed, \nthe regulation stresses that the notice should provide \u201c[a] brief description of the fi-\nnancial institution\u2019s overdraft service.\u201d Id.  \u00a7 1005.17(d)(1). If a bank charges overdraft \nfees only when the customer spends more money than she has in her account, the \nmodel language might be accurate. Cf. id. \u00a7 1005.4(a)(1). But when , as here,  a bank \nlooks at upcoming payments to calculate overdrafts , the template  might not be.  Cf. \nChambers v. NASA Federal Credit Union , 222 F. Supp. 3d 1, 15 \u201316 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(describing an opt -in agreement that adds to the template  \u201cexamples of situations \nthat might result in an overdraft\u201d).  \nB. Del-One is not shielded fr om liability  \nEven if the template  (as used here) is ambiguous,  Del-One says it cannot be held \nliable for using the government\u2019s suggested language.  D.I. 8, at 14 \u201315. It points to \nthe statute underlying the regulation , which  shields banks from liability for  \u201cany fail-\nure to make disclosure in proper form if [they] utilized an appropriate model clause.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  1693m(d)(2). Because it used the template , it says, it cannot be liable.  6 But Del -One confuses form with substance. \u201cForm\u201d refers primarily to the \u201c shape\u201d \nor \u201cconfiguration\u201d of something, not its content. Form  (def. 1 .a), The Oxford English \nDictionary (2d ed. 2000); see also Form  (def. 1), Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) \n(\u201cThe outer shape, structure, or configuration of something, as distinguis hed from its \nsubstance or matter.\u201d). Thus, Del -One might be shielded from a lawsuit about the \nnotice\u2019s configuration, such as whether it : \n\u2022 \u201c[p]rovide[d] a reasonable opportunity for the consumer to affirmatively \nconsent\u201d to the overdraft policy ; \n\u2022 provided the notice \u201cin writing\u201d ; or  \n\u2022 properly \u201csegregated\u201d the notice \u201cfrom all other information.\u201d  \n12 C.F.R. \u00a7  1005.17(b)(1)(i) \u2013(ii). \nChallenges to each of those requirements would be  challenges to the notice\u2019s \n\u201cshape\u201d or \u201cconfiguration.\u201d But Miller\u2019s argument \u2014that Del -One\u2019s use of the model \nlanguage failed to accurately \u201cdescrib[e] [its] overdraft service\u201d \u2014challenges its sub-\nstance. Id. \u00a7 1005.17(b)(1)(i); see Tims, 935 F.3d at 1244 \u201345; contra Tilley v. Mt. Am. \nFed. Credit Union , 2018 WL 4600655, at *5 (D. Utah Sept. 25, 2018). (Indeed, the \nmodel notice\u2019s formatting is one- size-fits-all. Its content, as I have explained, is not.) \nThus, Del -One is not shielded from Miller\u2019s regulatory cla im. \nIII. MILLER \u2019S CONSUMER -FRAUD CLAIM IS PLAUSIBLE  TOO \nMiller also says Del- One violated Delaware\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  85\u2013\n92. That Act bans  any \u201cdeception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, [or] misrepre-\nsentation\u201d in the provision of services. D el. Code tit. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 2513(a), 2511(6). Miller casts 7 the ambiguous opt -in notice as a misrepresentation: Del -One suggested it would only \ncharge overdraft fees when Miller did not have enough money in her account, but its \npolicy was not so limited.  \nDel-One pu shes back. It reminds me that the other account documents might pro-\nvide the full picture  of its overdraft policy. D.I. 8, at 16. But I have declined to look at \nthose documents.  \nAlternatively, it says , this claim repackages a breach -of-contract argument. Id. at \n15\u201316. Miller, it says, really protests \u201cthat Del -One charged her overdraft fees that \nwere not authorized\u201d by the opt -in notice. Id.  at 16.  And labeling that as a fraud claim  \nwould be  impermissib le becaus e claims \u201cbased entirely on a breach of  \u2026 a contract\u201d \nmust be brought \u201cin contract and not in tort.\u201d Brightstar Corp. v. PCS Wireless, LLC , \n2019 WL 3714917, at *10 (Del. Sup. Ct. Aug. 7, 2019)  (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). \nBut that argument rewrites Miller\u2019s complaint ; she does not argue that Del -One \nbroke some promise to her . Instead, she says Del -One \u201cfailed to disclose\u201d important \ninformation about its overdraft policy. Compl. \u00b6  87. That is a classic fraud argument, \nnot a breach -of-contract  one. So this claim may proceed too.  \n* * * * * \nMiller plausibly argues that Del- One\u2019s opt -in notice is misleading and confusing. \nSo I let her claims for regulatory violations and consumer fraud proceed.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nJOANNE MILLER, individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated,  \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nDEL -ONE  FEDERAL  CREDIT  UNION;  \nDOES  1\u201310. \n \nDefendant s. \n No. 21-cv-1433-SB \n \n \nORDER  \n1.
