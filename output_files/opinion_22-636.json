Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nOctober \\% , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nPe Wne.\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPlaintiff Charles Lewis Gresham, Jr., commenced this action on May 13,\n2022. (D.I. 2) He appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma\npauperis. (D.I. 4) The Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b).\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 3d\nCir. 2008). Plaintiff attempted to purchase a firearm in May 2020. (D.I. 2 at 5)\nHe alleges that his request was denied by the Department of Justice. (/d.) Plaintiff\nwas told by the DOJ that he is in a \u201cdenied status\u201d to purchase firearms based upon\nhis criminal background. (/d.) The DOJ told Plaintiff that he would remain in a\n\u201cdenied status\u201d \u201cunless the appropriate documentation [was] submitted to the\nFBI\u2019s Criminal Justice Information Services Division. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff contacted the Maryland State Commissioner of Criminal\nSentencing where Plaintiff was convicted and was advised that his criminal\ncharges did not preclude him from purchasing a weapon. (/d. at 6) Plaintiff wrote\nthe DOJ and provided it the information. (/d. at 7) Plaintiff contends that the DOJ\n\nerred in determining that he is a person prohibited from owning a firearm.\nPlaintiff asks the Court to restore his Second Amendment rights to purchase\nand own a firearm. (/d. at 9)\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\nJorma pauperis actions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a\ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.\nPhillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is\nliberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to\nless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\n\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n2\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling\non Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\n\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\n3\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\nIi. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff appears to allege that Defendants violated his right to bear arms\nunder the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. It is well-settled\n\u201cthat the United States of America may not be sued without its consent[.]\u201d United\nStates v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983); see F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471,\n475 (1994); United States v. Dalm, 494 U.S. 596, 608 (1990). The consent \u201cmust\nbe \u2018unequivocally expressed\u2019 in statutory text, and cannot simply be implied.\u201d\nAdeleke v. United States, 355 F.3d 144, 150 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing United States v.\nNordic Village, Inc., 503 US. 30, 33 (1992)). \u201cAbsent a waiver, sovereign\nimmunity shields the Federal Government. ...\u201d F.D.L.C., 510 U.S. at 475; see\nMierzwa v. U.S., 282 F. App\u2019x 973, 977 (3d Cir. 2008). \u201cSovereign immunity is\njurisdictional in nature,\u201d and consequently, if the United States has not waived\n\nsovereign immunity, the case must be dismissed for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction. Balice v. United States, 2018 WL 3727384, at *3-4 (D.N.J. Aug. 6,\n2018) (quoting F.D.I.C., 510 U.S. at 475).\n\nThe United States is not subject to suit for constitutional torts, including the\ncivil rights claims Plaintiff seeks to raise, because it is entitled to absolute\nsovereign immunity absent an explicit congressional waiver. FDIC v. Meyer, 510\nUS. 471, 475 (1994); Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 US.\n682, 687 (1949) (sovereign immunity bars suit against the United States either for\ndamages or for injunctive relief requiring government action.) The FBI and DOJ,\nas federal agencies, are thus immune from suit. See, e.g., Hindes v. F.D.L.C., 137\nF.3d 148, 158-59 (3d Cir. 1998); Martinez v. Eagle Disposal, 783 F. App\u2019x 206,\n209 (3d Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (determining that claims asserted against the FBI\nfor wiretapping were barred by sovereign immunity).\n\nDefendants have sovereign immunity and, therefore, the case must be\ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nCHARLES LEWIS GRESHAM, JR., _)\n)\n\nPlaintiff, )\n\n)\n\nv. ) CA.
