{"case_name": "Webb v. May", "case_number": "20-938", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "12-17-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nWILLIAM J. WEBB, JR., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nKIRK NEAL, et al., \nDefendants. ) \n) \n) \n) \n) Civil Action. No. 20-938-RGA \n) \n) \n) \n) \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington this 17th day of December , 2021, having considered Plaintiff's \nmotion for appointment of expert and motion to compel (0.1. 28, 32), \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motions (0.1. 28, 32) are DENIED in part and \nGRANTED in part, for the reasons that follow: \n1. The discovery deadline in this matter is December 12, 2021. (See 0.1. \n19). Plaintiff's deposition is scheduled for December 22, 2021. (0.1. 31 ). \n2. Motion to Compel. Plaintiff served discovery requests upon Defendants \non September 27, 2021, and Defendants responded to the requests on October 27, \n2021. (0.1. 20, 21, 23). Defendants objected to some requests and provided \ndocuments responsive to some requests. (See 0.1. 21, 23). Plaintiff filed a motion to \ncompel and for sanctions on November 29, 2021. (0.1. 32). He seeks responses to \nRequests (a), (b), (c), and (i). Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 a party is entitled to seek an \norder compelling discovery if the party has properly served interrogatories and/or \nrequests for production and the party upon whom served has failed to provide full, \ncomplete and timely responses . The motion will be granted in part and denied in part. \n1 The Court has reviewed Defendants ' responses and objections , finds most of the \nresponses adequate , but not all. Sanctions are not warranted. \n3. Request (a). Plaintiff requested any letters sent to Robert May pertaining \nto and leading up to this litigation. (D.I. 20 at 1, Request (a)). Defendants objected to \nthe request and also responded that no such letters exist. (D.I. 21 at 5). Defendants \ncannot produce that which does not exist. The objections are sustained . \n4. Request (b). Plaintiff requested any letters sent to Renee Hrivnak \npertaining to and leading up to this litigation. (D.I. 20 at 1, Request (b)). Defendants \nobjected that the request was overly broad, unduly burdensome , oppressive , not \nreasonably calculated to lead to discoverable admissible evidence , contained undefined \nterms, called for information to which Plaintiff has equal access or in his possession , \nand seeks information not within Defendants' possession, care, custody, or control. \n(D.I. 20 at 6). Hrivnak, a Deputy Attorney General, is not a defendant and not a prison \nemployee. Defendants ' objections are sustained . \n5. Request (c). Plaintiff requested any and all investigations performed by \nthe Department of Corrections Internal Affairs. (D.I. 20 at 1-2, Request (c)). Defendants \nobjected that the request was overly broad, unduly burdensome , oppressive , not \nreasonably calculated to lead to discoverable admissible evidence, and not limited to a \nspecific time-frame . (D.I. 20 at 6-7). These objections have merit, but, to the extent \nthere was an internal affairs investigation into the allegations that remain against Neal \nand/or Verde, that needs to be produced . The response is silent on that point. \nDefendants ' objections are sustained , for the most part , but Defendants are ORDERED \n2 to produce any internal affairs investigation of the subject incidents, or respond that \nthere were no such investigations . \n6. Request (i). Plaintiff requested video footage from July 8, 2019 until \nAugust 15, 2019. (D.I. 20 at 3, Request (i)). Defendants objected that the request was \noverly broad, oppressive , and not reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable \nadmissible evidence and also that they would coordinate with DOC personal to allow \nPlaintiff to view the video that depicts the July 18, 2019 incident. (D.I. 20 at 10). \nPlaintiff complains that he received a redacted copy of the July 18, 2019, incident, and \nhis request was more specific. Defendants ' objections are sustained. Hundreds of \nhours of video are irrelevant and burdensome. Defendants adequately responded to \nthe request. \n7. Motion for Expert Witness. Plaintiff seeks a use of force expert on the \ngrounds the expert would be a credible witness, the expert would avoid credibility issues \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence , and states that there are funds available to \nappoint an expert. (D.I. 28). The motion will be denied. Rule 706 provides that the trial \njudge has broad discretion to appoint an independent expert answerable to the court, \nwhether sua sponte or on the motion of a party. Ford v. Mercer County Corr. Ctr., 171 \nF. App'x 416, 420 (3d Cir. 2006). The policy behind the rule is to promote the jury's \nfactfinding ability. Id. (citations omitted). The costs of such an expert are borne by the \nparties, not by the Court. See Fullman v. City of Philadelphia , 793 F. App'x 126, 129 \n(3d Cir. 2019). \n8. The issue of use of force is not one that is \"a complex or esoteric subject \nbeyond the trier-of-fact's ability to adequately understand without expert assistance. \" \n3 Ford v. Mercy Cty. Carree. Ctr., 171 F. App'x 416, 520 (3d Cir. 2006). Nor has Plaintiff \ndemonstrated the ability to pay for such an expert. The motion to appoint an expert \nwitness is DENIED. \n4 "}
