No. 15-218-JFB-SRF\nANGIODYNAMICS, INC.,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 1st day of March, 2022, the court having considered defendant\nAngioDynamics, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cDefendant\u201d) motion to stay (D.L. 492), and the briefing associated\ntherewith (D.I. 493; D.I. 496; D.L. 497), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s motion to\nstay is DENIED for the following reasons:\n\n1. Background. Beginning in 2012, Plaintiffs C.R. Bard, Inc. and Bard Peripheral\nVascular, Inc. (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) asserted patents related to their power injectable port technology in\nsix cases across two judicial districts. See C.R. Bard Inc. v. Med. Components, Inc., C.A. No. ;\n12-32 (D. Utah) (Shelby, C.J.); CR Bard y, AngioDynamics, C.A. No. 12-35 (D. Utah) (Shelby,\nC.J.);! CR Bard v. Smiths Medical ASD, C.A. No. 12-36 (D. Utah) (Shelby, C.J.);?

Bard, Inc. et al. v.\n\n' This case was subsequently transferred to the District of Delaware, where it was assigned to\n\nChief Judge Connolly. See CR Bard v. AngioDynamics, C.A. No. 20-1544-CFC (D. Del.)\n\n(Connolly, C.J.).\n\n2 This case was subsequently transferred to the District of Delaware, where it was assigned to\n\nChief Judge Connolly. See C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Smiths Med. ASD, Inc., C.A. No. 20-1543-CFC (D.\nDel.) (Connolly, C.J.).\nAngioDynamics, Inc., C.A. No. 21-349-CFC (D. Del.) (Connolly, C.J.). In the three 2012 actions\nbrought in the District of Utah (the \u201cPort I cases\u201d), Plaintiffs asserted causes of action for\ninfringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,947,022 (\u201cthe \u2019022 patent\u201d); 7,785,302 (\u201cthe \u2019302 patent\u201d),\nand / or 7,959,615 (\u201cthe \u2019615 patent\u201d). Plaintiffs asserted claims for infringement of a different\ntrio of patents in this case (the \u201cPort II case\u201d) in 2015: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,475,417 (\u201cthe \u00b0417\npatent\u201d); 8,545,460 (\u201cthe \u00b0460 patent\u201d); and 8,805,478 (\u201cthe 478 patent\u201d). (DI. 1) The 2017\nUtah action (the \u201cPort III case\u201d) and the 2021 Delaware action (the \u201cPort IV case\u201d) involve yet\nanother set of patents covering Plaintiffs\u2019 power-injectable port technology.* Plaintiffs provided\n\na helpful visual aid for identifying the location and status of the various civil actions:\n\nD.

The court held a jury trial in this matter in April 2019, which concluded with the\ncourt\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law (\u201cJMOL\u201d) in favor of Defendant under Rule 50(a)\n\nafter the conclusion of Plaintiffs\u2019 case in chief. (D.I. 449) In the JMOL decision, the court\n\n3In CR. Bard, Inc. v. Med. Components, Inc., C.A. No. 17-754 (D. Utah) (Nielson, J.), Plaintiffs\nalleged infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,025,639; 8,382,723; 8,585,663; and 8,603,052. In C.\nR. Bard, Inc. et al. v. AngioDynamics, Inc., C.A. No. 21-349-CFC (D. Del.) (Connolly, C.J.),\nPlaintiffs alleged infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,025,639; 9,603,992; and 9,603,993.\n\n2\nreasoned that the \u2019478, 460, and \u2019417 patents were directed to ineligible printed matter under 35\nU.S.C. \u00a7 101. (D.I. 449) The Federal Circuit reversed the court\u2019s JMOL decision in November\n2020, concluding that \u201ceach claim as a whole is patent eligible because none are solely directed\nto the printed matter.\u201d C R Bard Inc. v. AngioDynamics, Inc., 979 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir.\n2020). Defendant subsequently filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc,\nalleging that \u201cthe panel\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 101 judgment has the unjust effect of\nprecluding AngioDynamics from raising its ineligibility defense at trial\u201d because \u201c[t]he panel did\nnot consider AngioDynamics\u2019s argument that the claims are directed to the abstract idea of\nidentification at step one and summarily decided that AngioDynamics did not meet its burden at\nstep two.\u201d (D.1.496, Ex. A at 4) The Federal Circuit denied Defendants petitions for panel\nrehearing and rehearing en banc. (Fed. Cir. Case No. 19-1756, D.L 77)\n\n3. The District of Utah addressed the issue of patent eligibility under \u00a7 101 in the\nPort III case in March 2021. There, the court extended the Federal Circuit\u2019s two-step eligibility\nanalysis to the patents at issue in the Port III case and concluded that the asserted patent claims\nwere not directed to an abstract idea. (D.I. 483, Ex. 1 at 77:7-82:1)\n\n4. Four months later, the District of Utah granted defendant Medical Components,\nInc.\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment in the Port I case, concluding that the \u00b0022, 302,\nand \u00b0615 patents were invalid under \u00a7 101 because the asserted claims were \u201cdirected to the\nineligible abstract idea of communicating information and lack an inventive concept[.]\u201d See CR.\nBard, Inc. v. Med. Components, Inc., --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2021 WL 3109914, at *19 (D. Utah\nJuly 22, 2021). The court subsequently certified its summary judgment decision for immediate\nappeal under Rule 54(b) (the \u201cMedComp Appeal\u201d) to \u201cgive the Federal Circuit an opportunity to\n\nfurther address the application of its patent eligibility case law . . . and the printed matter\n\ndoctrine.\u201d C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Med. Components, Inc., 2021 WL 5145284, at *5 (D. Utah Nov. 4,\n2021). In the certification decision, the court acknowledged \u201csome tension\u201d between its\nsummary judgment ruling and the interpretation given to the Federal Circuit\u2019s eligibility decision\nin the Port III case. Id.\n\n5. In the District of Delaware, the transferred Port I cases and the Port IV case were\nstayed as of December 27, 2021, pending the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in the MedComp\nAppeal. (D.L. 254)\n\n6. Defendant moved to stay this action in February 2022 until the Federal Circuit\u2019s\nresolution of the MedComp Appeal. (D.I. 492) The motion is now fully briefed and ripe for\nresolution.\n\n7. Legal Standard. A court has discretionary authority to grant a motion to stay.\nSee Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936); Dentsply Int\u2019l Inc. v. Kerr Mfg. Co., 734\nF. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Del. 1990). Courts generally consider three factors in deciding how to\nexercise this discretion: (1) whether a stay will simplify the issues for trial; (2) the status of the\nlitigation, particularly whether discovery is complete and a trial date has been set; and (3)\nwhether a stay would cause the non-movant to suffer undue prejudice from any delay or allow\nthe movant to gain aclear tactical advantage. See Am. Axle & Manuf, Inc. v. Neapco Holdings\nLLC, C.A. No. 15-1168-LPS, 2021 WL 616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021) (citing Ethicon\nLLC v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., C.A. No. 17-871-LPS, 2019 WL 1276029, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 20,\n2019)).\n\n8. Analysis. Defendant asks this court to stay the pending action until the Federal\nCircuit resolves the MedComp Appeal, arguing that the Federal Circuit\u2019s 2020 decision in this\n\ncase did not address or resolve Defendant\u2019s other ineligibility theories and stressing that the\n\n*302, \u00b0022, and \u2019615 patents are materially identical to the \u2019478, \u00b0460, and \u2019417 patents at issue\nin this case. (D.I. 493 at 11-15) These arguments ignore the law of the case. The Federal\nCircuit considered the eligibility of the 478, \u00b0460, and 417 patents and reversed the district\ncourt\u2019s determination that the patents were ineligible. C R Bard Inc. v. AngioDynamics, Inc.,\n\n979 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2020). This court has no authority to nullify the Federal Circuit\u2019s\nfinal judicial determination regarding the eligibility of the 478, \u00b0460, and \u00b0417 patents. See id.\nat 1384 (\u201cWe therefore hold that the asserted claims are not patent ineligible under \u00a7 101 because\nthe claims in their entireties are not solely directed to printed matter.\u201d).\n\n9. The alleged material identity of the 302, 022, and 615 patents and the \u2019478,\n\u00b0460, and \u00b0417 patents is irrelevant because the Federal Circuit issued a final determination on\nthe eligibility of the \u00b0478, \u00b0460, and \u2019417 patents. Even if the Federal Circuit were to invalidate\nthe \u2019302, \u00b0022, and \u2019615 patents under \u00a7 101 in the MedComp Appeal, the ruling would not\nchange the Federal Circuit\u2019s final determination in this case that the \u00b0478, \u2019460, and \u00b0417 patents\nare eligible under \u00a7 101. Issues regarding the eligibility of the 478, 460, and 417 patents\ncannot be further simplified because they have already been decided on appeal.\n\n10. Defendant suggests that this court is not foreclosed from considering ineligibility\narguments beyond the printed matter issue that formed the basis of the Federal Circuit\u2019s\neligibility determination. (D.I. 493 at 11) But as Defendant acknowledged in its petition for\npanel rehearing, \u201c[t]he panel\u2019s reversal on \u00a7 101 .. . forecloses AngioDynamics\u2019s ability to\n\npresent its full range of defenses against Bard\u2019s infringement claims.\u201d* (D.I. 496, Ex. A at 16)\n\n4 This position finds support in the guiding principles of \u00a7 101 jurisprudence. The Supreme\nCourt and the Federal Circuit have characterized the \u00a7 101 patent-eligibility inquiry as a\nthreshold test that presents an issue of law. See Alice Corp. Pty, Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l, 1348.\nCt. 2347, 2355 (2014); Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 75\n(2012); Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 602 (2010); see also Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.\n\n5\n\nThe Federal Circuit did not remand the issue of \u00a7 101 eligibility of the \u2019478, \u00b0460, and \u2019417\npatents for further consideration by this court of additional ineligibility arguments raised by\nDefendant. Instead, the Federal Circuit reversed the holding of the district court and concluded\nthat the asserted claims of the \u2019478, \u2019460, and \u2019417 patents are eligible under \u00a7 101. This is the\nlaw of the case.\n\n11. Defendant discusses the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in CardioNet, LIC v.\nInfoBionic, Inc. to suggest that the reversal of the \u00a7 101 determination does not bar consideration\nof alternate theories under \u00a7 101 at the trial court level. (D.I. 497 at 5-6) In CardioNet, the\ndistrict court granted a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in favor of the defendant after finding\nthat the asserted patent was invalid under \u00a7 101. CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic, Inc., 348 F.\nSupp. 3d 87 (D. Mass. 2018). The Federal Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s ineligibility\ndetermination, finding that the intrinsic evidence established that the claims of the asserted patent\nwere not directed to an abstract idea and there was no need to reach step two of the Alice inquiry.\nSee CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic, Inc., 955 F.3d 1358, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Rejecting the\ndefendant\u2019s argument in favor of a remand of the \u00a7 101 issue for further development of the\n\nrecord, the Federal Circuit concluded that \u201ca remand is unnecessary\u201d because the question\n\nCapital One Fin. Corp., 850 F.3d 1332, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Indeed, the Federal Circuit has\nexplored whether the \u00a7 101 inquiry may be addressed sua sponte. See Whitserve, LLC v.\nComputer Packages, Inc., 694 F.3d 10, 41 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (Mayer, J., dissenting). And it is\nwell-established that step one of the \u00a7 101 analysis requires the court to consider whether the\nclaim\u2019s character as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter. See Affinity Labs of Tex.,\nLLC v. DIRECTV, LLC, 838 F.3d 1253, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2016). These principles suggest that the\ntwo-step Alice framework was designed to detect any eligibility issues by requiring a close\nexamination of the claims, and eligibility issues beyond the printed matter doctrine would not\nhave eluded the Federal Circuit\u2019s consideration in reaching a final determination on eligibility in\nthis case. See, e.g., CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic, Inc., 955 F.3d 1358, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 2020)\n(concluding that asserted claims were not directed to an abstract idea under Alice step one based\non a review of the intrinsic evidence).\n\npresented in that case was a legal question that could be answered based on the intrinsic\nevidence. Jd. at 1371-72. In this regard, the Federal Circuit\u2019s approach to the \u00a7 101 eligibility\nissue in CardioNet is wholly consistent with this court\u2019s reasoning in denying the motion to stay.\n12. Instead of focusing on the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision, however, Defendant\nemphasizes the CardioNet district court\u2019s handling of the issue on remand in a decision that has\nnot been subjected to appellate review. The district court interpreted the Federal Circuit\u2019s\nreversal as a conclusion that the district court improperly found the asserted patent ineligible on\nthe pleadings, and the law of the case doctrine did not bar further development of the record and\nadjudication on the merits. See CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic, Inc., 2021 WL 1723847, at *2 (D.\nMass. Apr. 30, 2021). In accordance with that interpretation, the district court denied the\ndefendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment of ineligibility under \u00a7 101 without prejudice based\non its determination that claim construction was necessary before evaluating the question of\npatent eligibility. Jd at *3. Even if the court were to follow the CardioNet district court\u2019s\nreasoning on remand, the outcome on this record would remain the same because claim\nconstruction, summary judgment, and trial are complete, and the Federal Circuit reversed the\ndistrict court\u2019s \u00a7 101 eligibility decision based on consideration of a full evidentiary record. See\n\nC R Bard Inc. v. AngioDynamics, Inc., 979 F.3d 1358, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2020).\n\n5 Using selective quotes, Defendant wrongly suggests that the Federal Circuit concluded the\nevidence was insufficient to reach an eligibility determination in this case. (D.I. 497 at 5-6)\n(\u201cThe Federal Circuit\u2019s statement that the \u2018evidence is not sufficient to establish [ineligibility] as\na matter of law\u2019 thus reflects the undeveloped record and procedural posture.\u201d). Not so. The\nFederal Circuit held that \u201cthe asserted claims are not patent ineligible under \u00a7 101 because the\nclaims in their entireties are not solely directed to printed matter.\u201d C R Bard Inc. v.\nAngioDynamics, Inc., 979 F.3d 1372, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2020). The court went on to explain that,\n\u201ceven if we were to conclude that the sole focus of the claimed advance was the printed matter,\nAngioDynamics\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to establish as a matter of law, at Alice step two, that\nthe use of a radiographic marker . . . was not an inventive concept.\u201d Jd. (emphasis added).\nIgnoring the Federal Circuit\u2019s determinative conclusion at step one, Defendant argues that it\n\n7\n13. The stay of three other civil actions in this district pending resolution of the\nMedComp Appeal does not alter the equation. The two Port I cases pending in this district assert\ncauses of action for infringement of the \u2019022 patent, the 302 patent, and the \u00b0615 patent\u2014the\nsame patents at issue in the pending MedComp Appeal. (C.A. No. 20-1544-CFC; C.A. No. 20-\n1543-CFC) The Port IV case does not. (C.A. No. 21-349-CFC) Unlike the circumstances in\nthis case, however, the Federal Circuit has not yet rendered a final determination on the\neligibility of the patents at issue in the Port IV case.\n\n14. _ Because a stay will not simplify the issues in this case for the reasons stated in\nparagraphs 8 to 10, supra, Defendant\u2019s complaints about the \u201csubstantial work\u201d to be done\nbefore trial are not compelling. (D.I. 493 at 16)\n\n15. Conclusion. IT IS ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s motion to stay is DENIED. (D.L\n492)\n\n16. This Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written\nobjections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Order.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to five (5) pages\n\neach.\n\ncould have satisfied its evidentiary burden at step two if it had the opportunity to present its case\nin chief at trial. (D.I. 497 at 5) But Defendant submitted full summary judgment briefing and\nexhibits on the patent eligibility issues in this case. (D.I. 259; D.I. 261; D.I. 306) Thus, the\navailable evidence has been on the record, and the court considered the evidence and trial\ntestimony in issuing the JMOL decision that was the subject of the Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling.
