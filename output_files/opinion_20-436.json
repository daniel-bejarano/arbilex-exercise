D.I. 27 at 1.  Plaintiffs allege that \u201cas a matter of policy and \npractice, Wynd ham uniformly and standardly fail[e d] to disclose basic material facts about its \ntimeshare program\u201d during its sales presentations .  Id. \u00b6 6.  Plaintiffs allege that this conduct \nconstitute s common law fraudulent inducement by omission (Count One), violat es the Nevada \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act ( \u201cNDTPA\u201d ) (Count Two), and  violates  the Tennessee Timeshare \nAct ( \u201cTTA \u201d) (Count Three) .  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 92\u2013108.   \nOn March 30, 2021, the Court granted Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 \nComplaint for failure to plead fraud with particularity pursuant to Rule 9(b).  D.I. 19 at 9.  \nPlaintiffs  filed an Amended Complaint1 on April 26, 2021.  D.I. 27.  Pending before me is \nWyndham\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint.  D.I. 29.   \nI. BACKGROUND Wyndham, a De laware corporation, operates a timeshare ownership program that sells \nownership interests in the form of points that can be used as currency to stay at Wyndham \nresorts.  D.I. 27 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 12.  Plaintiffs Steve and Elizabeth Kirchner accepted a two -day \npromotional trip to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee that was conditioned on their attendance at a \nWyndham sales presentation  at the Margaritaville Island Hotel Pigeon Forge on February 11, \n2018.  Id . \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36.  At the sales presentation, the  Kirchners signed a timeshare contract to \n \n1 The Complaint listed Steven Kirchner, Elizabeth Kirchner, and Nazret Gebremeskel as \nPlaintiffs.  D.I. 1.  The Amended Complaint removed Nazret Gebremeskel and added  Marcia \nRichards as a plaintiff.  D.I. 27.    \n2 \n purchase  84,000 points for $15,500.  Id . \u00b6\u00b6 33, 40.  Since signing the contract, the Kirchners \nhave been unable to book stays at their preferred Wyndham destinations for the dates they desire.  \nId. \u00b6 41.  They also discovered that their timeshare ownership was \u201cactually going to have \nnegative economic value. \u201d  Id. \u00b6 42.  Specifically, t he Kirchners determined that the value of \ntheir 84,000 points was $870, and that after subtracting the yearly maintenance fee (which is currently $707 but increases each year), the benefit they received for the Wyndham ownership they purchased for $15,500 was $163.  Id . \u00b6 43.  After concluding, \u201c It will be cheaper for them to \nbook vacations at Wyndham resorts without ownership than with ownership,\u201d  the Kirchners \nasked Wyndham to cancel their contract, but Wyndham has refuse d to do so.  Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 41, 45.  \nPlaintiff Marcia Richards attended a Wyndham sales presentation at the Club Wyndham \nGrand Desert in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 19, 2016.  Id . \u00b6 47.  Immediately following the \npresentation, Richards signed a contract  with Wyndham  and purchased \u201ca \n200,000/3,015,653,000 undivided fee simple interest  as tenants in common in Parcel 2 \n(\u2018Property \u2019) of Grand Desert Resort\u201d for $35,900.  Id., Ex. C  \u00a7 1.  After  her purchase, Richards \n\u201cdiscovered that none of what the sales representatives had told her was true and that they had engaged in the omissions pled in paragraph 7 (a) to (k) above.\u201d  Id . \u00b6 57.  Richards has asked \nWyndham to cancel her contract, but Wyndham has refused to do so.  Id . \u00b6 59.   \nThe Complaint alleges that all proposed class members, including the Kirchners and \nMarcia Richards , experienced \u201cthe exact same fraud by omission\u201d when Wyndham sa les \nrepresentatives failed to disclose to them during the sales presentations :  \na. [T]hat they will rarely be able to use their timeshares to stay at \ntheir desired locations;  \nb. [T]hat they will need to book up to thirteen months in advance;   \nc. [T]hat their timeshares will have limited, if any, resale value;    \n3 \n d. [T]hat they will be unable to refinance their timeshare purchases \nto replace Wyndham\u2019s interest rate which can be as high as 15.99%;  \ne. [T]hat Wyndham will not take their timeshares back unless they first pay off all amounts due to Wyndham;  \nf. [T]hat Wyndham regularly offers better availability to non-Owners on whom it seeks to earn more money by selling them timeshares instead of making spac e available to existing \ntimeshare Owners;  \ng. [T]hat if they want to stay at a Wyndham timeshare destination that is not available on the Club Wyndham website, they can go to expedia.com or [a] similar free public website and book the \nsame destination which wi ll be available on the public website \nand will be available at a cheaper cost than had they used their Wyndham timeshare points;  \nh. [T]hat they will not be able to rent out their timeshares to cover their maintenance fees;  \ni. [T]hat annual maintenance fees will increase significantly; [and ] \nj. [T]hat using Wyndham points for car rental, airfare, and cruises will be more expensive than paying cash [.] \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 34, 47, 60.  \nPlaintiffs filed their Complaint on March 27, 2020 .  D.I. 1.  Wyndham filed a motion to \ndismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint on June 5, 2020.  D.I. 6.  The Court  granted Wyndham\u2019s motion, \ndismiss ing the Complaint after  the Court held that Plaintiffs had  not satisf ied Rule 9(b)\u2019s \nrequirement that they plead fraud with parti cularity.  D.I. 19 at 7.  The Court  granted Plaintiffs\u2019 \nmotion for leave to file an amended complaint, D.I. 25, and on April 26, 2021, Plaintiffs filed \ntheir Amended Complaint. D.I. 27.  \nIn their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, the can cellation of their \ncontracts, and damages (compensatory, restitution, punitive, and attorneys\u2019 fees).  They renew \ntheir request to certify sub classes \u201cunder Nevada and Tennessee consumer protection and  \n4 \n timeshare statutes,\u201d and add a request to certify a ne w \u201cnational class based on fraud claims.\u201d  Id . \n\u00b6 10.  \nII. ANALYSIS  \nWyndham makes three arguments  in support of its motion: (1) \u201cthe [Amended \nComplaint] does not plead fraud with particularity,\u201d D.I. 30 at 6; (2) \u201cthe claims of newly added Plaintiff Richards ar e untimely,\u201d id . at 8; and (3) \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 omission claims fail as a matter of \nlaw,\u201d id  at 13.  I will address the arguments in the order in which Wyndham presented them .   \nA. The Rule 9(b) Motion  \nIn actions for fraud, a complaint must satisfy Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standards.  \nIn re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002).  Plaintiffs do not dispute that their  claims must satisfy Rule 9(b).   Rule 9(b) re quires , \u201cIn alleging fraud or \nmistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).  \u201cParticularity\u201d has been interpreted to require that plaintiffs \u201cplace the \ndefendant on notice of the pre cise misconduct with which [it is] charged\u201d by \u201calleg[ing] the date, \ntime and place of the alleged fraud or otherwise inject[ing] precision or some measure of substantiation into a fraud allegation.\u201d  Alpizar -Fallas v. Favero, 908 F.3d 910, 918\u201319 (3d Cir. \n2018) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also  United States ex rel. Bookwalter \nv. UPMC , 946 F.3d 162, 176 (3d Cir. 2019) (requiring \u201cthe who, what, when, where, and how of \nthe events at issue\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omit ted)).   \n Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 9(b)\u2019s requirement that they plead fraud with particularity.  \nThe Court  granted Wyndham\u2019s first motion to dismiss for failure to plead fraud with particularity \nafter the Court held, \u201c In short, Plaintiffs failed to p lead in the Complaint the specific dates and \nlocations of the alleged fraud and the identities of the individuals who perpetrated the alleged  \n5 \n fraud . And they did not otherwise inject into the Complaint a degree of precision or some \nmeasure of substantiatio n to their allegations that would provide sufficient notice to Wyndham of \nthe alleged fraud.\u201d  D.I. 19 at 9.  In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs plead the specific dates \nand locations of the alleged fraud along with the identities of the sales representatives who perpetrated the alleged fraud.  Plaintiffs allege:   \nThe Kirchners attended their sales presentation at the Club \nWyndham resort, Margaritaville Island Hotel Pigeon Forge, 131 \nThe Island Drive, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee 37863.  The sales presentati on occurred on February 11, 2018 and they signed their \ncontract number 0291- 1800654, member number 00203442649 on \nthe same day immediately after a multi- hour sales presentation.  \nTheir Wyndham sales people were Dave Monghi, Resort Representative ID 639669, and Ethan Hamby who signed their contract.  On February 11, 2018, Monghi and Hamby failed to disclose to the Kirchners any of the material facts set forth in paragraph 7 (a) to (k) above.  \n \n*** \n Marcia [Richards] attended a Wyndham sales presentation at the \nClub Wyndham Grand Desert, 265 East Harmon Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada 89169 on May 19, 2016.  She signed contract number 00041- 16112013 on the same day immediately after the \nsales presentation at the same location.  Her Wyndham sales representative was Lovan Crescini Southerland.  When Marcia \nexpressed resistance to buying, Lovan Crescini Southerland was joined by Wyndham Sales Representative Patrick Yousef Abinader.  Wyndham sales representative Christina Arnstin (last name spelling base d on reading of signature on contract), Sales \nAgent or Broker License Number 3316 was the Wyndham Quality Assurance Representative who was presented the contract documents and signed them for Wyndham.  Southerland, Abinader and Christina were all present o n May 19, 2016 at the Club \nWyndham Grand Desert, and they all made the omissions to Marcia pled in paragraph 7  (a) to (k) above.   \n \nD.I. 27 \u00b6\u00b6 33\u201334, 47 (citations omitted).  \nWyndham argues  that the Amended Complaint still lacks the requisite particularity \nbecause \u201cPlaintiffs still do not allege which \u2018destinations\u2019 they purportedly \u2018desired,\u2019 when they  \n6 \n attempted to book, or the extent to which destinations  were \u2018unavailable\u2019 through Wyndham  but \navailable through unrelated \u2018public travel websites.\u2019\u201d  D.I. 30 at 7.  But the level of particularity \nWyndham asserts is required is m uch higher than what Rule 9(b) requires \u2014i.e., to \u201cplead or \nallege the date, time and place of the alleged fraud.\u201d  Fr ederico v. Home Depot , 507 F.3d 188, \n200 (3d Cir. 2007).  Accordingly, I will deny Wyndham\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to plead fraud with particularity pursuant to Rule 9(b).  \nB. Timeliness of Plaintiff Richards\u2019s Claims  \nWyndham argues , \u201c[T]he claims of  new plaintiff Marcia Richards are time -barred\u201d and \nthus should be dismissed.  D.I. 30 at 2.  Although \u201cthe strict language of Rule 8(c) . . . requires that a limitations defense be raised in the answer,\u201d \u201cthe so -called \u2018Third Circuit Rule\u2019 [] permits a \nlimitations defense to be raised by a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) . . . if \u2018the time alleged in the statement of a claim shows that the cause of action has not been brought within the statute of limitations.\u2019\u201d  Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 135\u201336 (3d Cir . 2002) (citation omitted). \nThe parties  first dispute which statute of limitations governs Richards\u2019s  NDTPA claim.\n2  \nPlaintiffs contend that Nevada\u2019s four-year limitations period  applies , D.I. 32 at 13\u201314, while \nWyndham asserts that Delaware\u2019s three- year limitation s period for fraud claims applies, D.I. 30 \nat 8\u20139.  \u201cA federal court, sitting in diversity, follows the forum\u2019s choice of law rules to determine \nthe applicable statute of limitations.\u201d  Ross v. Jo hns\u2013Manville Corp., 766 F.2d 823, 826 (3d Cir. \n1985).  Under Delaware's borrowing statute,  \nWhere a cause of action arises outside of [Delaware], an action \ncannot be brought in a court of [Delaware] to enforce such cause of \naction after the expiration of w hichever is shorter, the time limited \nby the law of [Delaware], or the time limited by the law of the state \n \n2 Plaintiffs do not dispute in their a nswering brief that Richards\u2019s  common law fraud claim is  \nsubject to a three -year limitation period. See D.I. 32 at 9\u201314.  \n7 \n or country where the cause of action arose, for bringing an action \nupon such cause of action.  \nD\nEL. CODE ANN. tit. 10, \u00a7 8121.  The Delaware statute  of limitations for claims that sound in \nfraud is three years.  Id.  \u00a7 8106(a).  Plaintiffs argue that the Delaware borrowing statute \u201conly \napplies if Delaware has a longer statute of limitations than where the cause of action arose.\u201d  D.I. \n32 at 13\u201314.  T he clear and unambiguous  language of Delaware\u2019s borrowing statute  directly \nforecloses  Plaintiffs\u2019  argument .  Because the cause of action arose outside of Delaware, and the \nlimitations period for NDTPA claims is four years, Delaware\u2019s shorter limitations pe riod of three \nyears  applies to Richards\u2019s NDTPA claim.  Therefore, absent tolling,3 the limitations period for \nRichards\u2019s claims expired three years after she signed her contract  (on May 19, 2016) \u2014so , on \nMay 19, 2019.  That date was 708 days before Richards\u2019s  claims were added to the Amended \nComplaint .   \nPlaintiffs argue that Richards\u2019s claims are timely because \u201c[they] relate[] back to the \noriginal complaint in this case\u201d and thus \u201c[t]he class period goes back to four years before the \noriginal compl aint was filed, March 27, 2016.\u201d  D.I. 32 at 10.  Even accepting Plaintiffs\u2019 \nargument that Richards\u2019s claims relate back to the original complaint in this case, the applicable \nlimitations period is three years, so the class period would go back three years  before the original \ncomplaint was filed, to March 27, 2017.  Richards signed her contract on May 19, 2016, and thus would still be 312 days out of the limitations period when the original complaint was filed .\n4  \n \n3 Plaintiffs do not contend that Richards\u2019s claims are subject to equitable tolling. See D.I. 32 at \n9\u201314. \n4 In a footnote  in their answering brief , Plaintiffs argue that Richards\u2019s claims were tolled under \nAmerican Pipe & Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538 (1974), both by the Illinois class action \nfiled on August 14, 2019 ( and pending for 182 days until  dismissed by the court ), and by this \ncase ( for another 368 days) .  D.I. 32 at 12 n.3.  But there would have been no remaining \nlimitations period to be tolled at the point the Illinois case was filed, as the three -year limitations \nperiod on Richards\u2019s claim expired on May 19, 2019, 87 days before t he Illinois case was filed.   \n8 \n Because Richards\u2019s claims are untimely, I will dismiss them.   \nC. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion  \nWyndham argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims fail as a matter of law for three \nindependent reasons.  First, Wyndham asserts that \u201cmany of the allegedly \u2018omitted\u2019 facts were \ndisclosed in Plaintiffs\u2019 contracts .\u201d  D.I. 30 at 13.  While a court \u201cmay grant a motion to dismiss \nwhen unambiguous language of a contract contradicts plaintiffs\u2019 allegations,\u201d Phunware, Inc. v. \nExcelmind Gr p. Ltd., 117 F. Supp. 3d 613, 625 (D. Del. 2015), the language Wyndham identifies \nin the contracts does  not \u201cunambiguous[ly]\u201d contradict Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.  For example, \nWyndham states that Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged omission that owners \u201cwill need to book [destinations] up to thirteen months in advance\u201d is explicitly disclosed where the contracts state, \u201cPurchaser understands that Purchaser may request a reservation at the Home Resort up to thirteen (13) months in advance of my check- in date, utilizing the Advance d Reservation Priority.\u201d  D.I. 30 at \n14 (alteration in original) .  But this \u201cdisclosure\u201d does not unambiguously contradict Plaintiffs\u2019 \nallegation .  Rather , the likely  reading of this contract provision would be that owners are allowed  \nto place their reserv ations up to thirteen  months in advance.   \nThe rest of Wyndham\u2019s \u201cdisclosures\u201d also do not unambiguously contradict Plaintiffs\u2019 \nallegations.  Compare D.I. 27 \u00b6 7(d) (\u201cCustomers are not told that they will be unable to refinance their timeshare purchases to  replace Wyndham\u2019s interest rate which can be as high as \n15.99% .\u201d), with D.I. 30 at 14 (\u201cRefinancing this loan will depend on your future financial \nsituation, the property value, and market conditions.  You may not be able to refinance this loan.\u201d); compare D.I. 27 \u00b6 7(i) (\u201c Customers are not told that annual maintenance fees will \n \nAccordingly, there was also no remaining time in the limitations period on Richards\u2019s claims to \nbe tolled at the point this Complaint was filed on March 27, 2020.   \n9 \n increase significantly.\u201d) , with D.I. 30 at 15 (\u201cRegular Assessments may be increased annually.\u201d) , \nand D.I. 31, Ex. B \u00a7 5 (\u201cThe annual assessment . . . [is] subject to change . . . .\u201d ).  Therefore, I \nwill not dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims on this ground.  \nSecond , Wyndham asserts that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed because Wyndham  \n\u201chas no duty to disclose the availability and pricing of products offered by other companies ,\u201d and \nthus Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Wyndham did not disclose this information \u201cfa ll short of stating \nan omission claim.\u201d  D.I. 30 at 15\u201316.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that Wyndham has no duty to \ndisclose competitor pricing.  Rather, Plaintiffs argue that Wyndham\u2019s characterization of its allegations is incorrect: \u201c The Amended Complaint explicitly states that Plaintiffs do not contend \nthat Wyndham must disclose its competitor pricing\u201d ; instead , \u201cPlaintiffs allege that Wyndham \ntimeshares have no value and that non- Owners have better access and pricing at Wyndham\u2019s \nown resorts.\u201d  D.I. 32 at 16.   \nI do find that one of the ten \u201comissions\u201d Plaintiffs allege  in their Amended Complaint  \ndoes a ssert that Wyndham should have disclosed competitors \u2019 pricing.  Plaintiffs allege , \n\u201cCustomers are not told that if they want to stay at a Wyndham  timeshare destination that is not \navailable on the Club Wyndham website, they can go to expedia.com or similar free public \nwebsite[s] and book the same destination which will be available on the public website and will be available at a cheaper cost than h ad they used their Wyndham timeshare points.\u201d  D.I. 27 \u00b6 \n7(g).  The first part of this allegation , that Wyndham does not reserve enough rooms for use by \nOwners, does not involve Wyndham disclosing information about competitors.  Wyndham is in control  of how many rooms it reserves for Owners and how many it provides to competitors.  \nBut, the second part of the allegation, that \u201c[c]ustomers are not told that  . . . the same destination \n. . . will be available at a cheaper cost [on a public website] than had [t he owners] used their  \n10 \n Wyndham timeshare points ,\u201d does impute a duty on Wyndham to disclose competitor pricing.  \nTherefore, since Plaintiffs do not dispute that Wyndham does not have a duty to disclose \ncompetitor pricing, I will strike this  portion of the  allegation .   \nThird , Wyndham asserts that the remaining TTA  claim should  be dismissed because the \nTTA \u201cprohibit[s] misstatements, not omissions.\u201d5  D.I. 30 at 18.  Plaintiffs do specifically allege \nthat their lawsuit is limited to \u201cWyndham\u2019s single, common fraudulent scheme of material omissions \u2014not affirmative misrepresentations. \u201d  D.I. 27 \u00b6 22 (\u201c This case is about what \nWyndham does not  tell customers, rather th [a]n what it does tell them.\u201d (emphasis in original) ).  \nPlaintiffs do not identify in their Amended Complaint which provisions of the TTA apply to their claims, but they assert in their answering brief that the applicab le provisions are Tenn. Code. \nAnn. \u00a7\u00a7 66- 32-131, 132.  D.I. 32 at 17.   \nSection 131 prohibits misleading advertising:  \nIt is unlawful for any person with intent directly or indirectly to offer \nfor sale or sell time -share intervals in this state to authorize, use, \ndirect or aid in the publication, distribution or circulation of any advertisement, radio broadcast or telecast  concerning the time -share \nproject in which the time -share intervals are offered, which contains \nany statement, pictorial representation or sketch which is false or misleading.    \nT\nENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 66 -32-131.  Section 132 contains a list of thirteen specif ic prohibitions \nagainst false advertising , including a general prohibition of \u201cany misleading or deceptive \nrepresentation with respect to the contents of the time -share program, the purchase contract, the \npurchaser\u2019s rights, privileges, benefits or obligat ions under the purchase contract .\u201d  Id.  \u00a7 66 -32-\n132(11).   \n \n5  Wyndham also argues that Richards\u2019s NDTPA claim should be di smissed for the same \nreasons.  D.I. 30 at 18\u201319.  This argument is moot as I am dismissing Richards\u2019s NDTPA claim as untimely.    \n11 \n  Wyndham points to the fact that the language of the TTA does not encompass  omissions.  \nBut Wyndham does not  cite any case dismissing claims for material omissions under the TTA.  \nThe court in the case Wyndham does cite as \u201cdismissing [the] TTA claim because alleged \nmisrepresentation was not prohibited by statute ,\u201d D.I. 3 0 at 19, actually found, \u201cWyndham \nDefendant agents did make TTA -proscribed misrepresentations at the meeting ,\u201d but dismissed \nthe claim specifically because the agents \u201cdid not injure the Bobicks because the Bobicks did not make a purchase as a result .\u201d Bobick v. Wyndham Worldwide Operating, Inc., 2018 WL \n4566804, at *4 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 24, 2018).    Not only can Wyndham not point to a case holding that the TTA precludes recovering on \nmaterial omissions, but there are cases that affirmatively found that a plaintiff could proceed with a claim under the TTA based on allegations of material omissions.  Fo r example, i n Noblitt \nv. Bluegreen Vacations Unlimited, Inc., the p laintiffs specifically alleged that the d efendants \nviolated Section 66- 32-132 of the TTA  in part through \u201cadvertising and marketing the Bluegreen \ntimeshares to the Plaintiffs in such ways that omitted material information .\u201d  Am.  Compl. at \u00b6 \n165, Noblitt v. Bluegreen Vacations Unlimited, Inc., No. 3: 18-cv-117 (E.D. Tenn. Apr. 18, \n2018) , ECF No. 9.  The d efendants  in Noblitt specifically argued  in their motion to dismiss  that \n\u201can alleged \u2018fail ure to disclose\u2019 cannot form the basis of a misrepresentation cause of action, \nsuch as the Tennessee Timeshare Act, as Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate as a matter of law that any of the Defendants actually made an affirmative representation.\u201d  Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 20, Noblitt v. Bluegreen Vacations Unlimited, Inc., No. 3:18- cv-117 (E.D. Tenn. May 16, 2018), \nECF No. 13.  The Eastern District of Tennessee did not explicitly discuss  the defendant s\u2019 \nargument but  did deny their  motion to dismiss the  TTA claim and held, \u201cPlaintiffs have timely  \n12 \n and properly asserted a claim under the Tennessee Timeshare Act.\u201d  Noblitt v. Bluegreen \nVacations Unlimited, Inc., 2019 WL 7290474, at *16 (E.D. Tenn. Mar. 20, 2019) . \nSimilarly, in Moore v. Westgate Resorts Ltd., Plaintiffs \u201callege[d] that Defendants \nencourage[d] and/or allow[ed] their sales agents to conceal material facts regarding the lack of unit availability due to Defendant\u2019s practice of overselling the Resort.\u201d  2020 WL 6814666, at *17 (E.D. Tenn. Nov. 18, 2020)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .  The court there \nheld, \u201c Plaintiffs ha ve supplied sufficient facts to support the allegations of false advertisement, \nparticularly regarding Section 66- 32-132(11) of the A ct.\u201d  Id.   Therefore, Wyndham has failed \nto show  that the TTA does not encompass claims of material omissions.  \nBecause Wyndham has not met its burden to show Plaintiffs failed to state a claim under \nRule 12(b)(6), I will deny its motion to dismiss the remaining claims , namely, Counts One and \nThree.   \nIII. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, I will deny in part and grant in part Wyndham\u2019s motion to \ndismiss  Plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint.  I will deny Wyndham\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to \nplead fraud  with particularity , grant Wyndham\u2019s motion to dismiss Richards\u2019s claims for \nuntimeliness , and deny Wyndham\u2019s motion to dismiss the remaining claims for failure to state a \nclaim.   I will also strike the portion of paragraph 7(g) of the Amended Complaint st ating that \ncustomers were not told that Wyndham destinations \u201cwill be available at a cheaper cost [on a public website] than had they used their Wyndham timeshare points.\u201d  D.I. 27 \u00b6 7(g).   \nThe Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opi nion.  \n \n \n \n \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nSTEVEN ERIC KIRCHNER,  \nELIZABETH LEE KIRCHNER, and  \nMARCIA RICHARDS, individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated,  \n        \nPlaintiffs, \n  v. \nW\nYNDHAM VACATION  \nRESORTS, INC.,  C\nivil Action No. 20-436- RGA \nD\nefendant.  \nORDER \nA\nt Wilmington this 14th day of January 2022: \nFor the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion issued this day, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint (D.I. 29) is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART  as follows : \n1.
