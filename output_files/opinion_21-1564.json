INTRODUCTION\nPresently before the court in this insurance bad faith breach of contract action are motions\nto remand the action to state court (D.I. 3; D.L. 6)! and to strike Defendants\u2019 answer and\nDefendants\u2019 opposition to Plaintiff's motion for default judgment (D.L. 9)? filed by Plaintiff\nRichard Seeney (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019),? and a motion to vacate the partial default judgment filed by\nDefendants Insurance Company of North America (\u201cINA\u201d), ACE Property and Casualty\nInsurance Company (\u201cACE\u201d), and ESIS, Inc. (\u201cESIS\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) (D.I. 26).4\n\nAs indicated in the chart, infra, and for the reasons that follow, the court recommends\n\n' The briefing for Plaintiff's motion to remand is as follows: Plaintiff's opening brief (D.I. 3),\nDefendants\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 12), and Plaintiff's reply brief (D.I. 13). For purposes of this\nReport and Recommendation, the court treats Plaintiff's motion to amend the motion to remand\n(D.I. 6) as an amendment rather than a separate motion, as the responsive briefs address all\narguments raised therein.\n\n2 The briefing for Plaintiff's motion to strike is as follows: Plaintiff's opening brief (D.I. 10),\nDefendants\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 17), and Plaintiffs reply brief (D.I. 18).\n\n3 During the pendency of the motions, Defendants filed a Notice of Suggestion of Death of\nPlaintiff, indicating that Plaintiff died March 7, 2022. (D.I. 40)\n\n4 The briefing for Defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the partial default judgment is as follows:\nDefendants\u2019 opening brief (D.I. 26), Plaintiff's answering brief (D.I. 27), and Defendants\u2019 reply\nbrief (D.I. 28).\nDENYING Plaintiff's motion to remand and motion to strike and GRANTING Defendants\u2019\n\nmotion to vacate.\n\nl\n\nMotion to Strike Defendants\u2019 Answer and DENY\nDefendants\u2019 Response in Opposition to\nMotion for Default (D.L. 9\n\nD.I. 26\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nIn 1969, Plaintiff Seeney was catastrophically injured in an industrial accident while\nworking for Marvel Construction Company (\u201cMarvel\u201d). (D.I. 1, Ex. A at ff 1, 16-17) His\ninjuries included, inter alia, complete severance of his spinal cord at the T12 vertebra, complete\nparalysis of everything below his umbilicus, and complete kidney failure involving both kidneys.\n(Id. at] 16) Asa result of the accident, Plaintiff met the criteria for catastrophic loss as defined\nunder 19 Dei. C. \u00a7 2326(e), was entitled to medical treatment for life, and was presumed to be\nentitled to lifetime total disability under 19 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2324 and 2326(e). (Id. at ] 17) Defendant\nINA provided worker\u2019s compensation insurance to Plaintiff's employer. (/d. at {J 2, 12)\nDefendant ACE is the parent company of INA. (/d. at ]3) Defendant ESIS is also wholly\nowned by ACE and is the third-party administrator (\u201cTPA\u201d) responsible for handling the claim\narising from Plaintiff's industrial accident. (Jd. at J] 4, 12)\n\nThe complaint alleges that \u201cfor decades\u201d the Defendants repeatedly failed to timely pay\nthe Plaintiffs medical expenses, services, treatment and supplies in violation of their obligations\n\nunder 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2322F(h). (id. at | 27-28) The Plaintiff presented claims for his medical\n\n5 Plaintiff adopts the name of his employer as it appears in Industrial Accident Board documents.\n(D.I. 1, Ex. A at \u00a7 10.1)\nexpenses to Delaware\u2019s Industrial Accident Board (\u201cI.A.B.\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) and received an award\non July 20, 2021, which included the costs for ongoing kidney treatment provided by Fresenius\nas of July 24, 2020. (D.I. 34 at 165-67)\u00b0 The I.A.B. found that Marvel accepted compensability\nof the kidneys on the first day of the hearing, March 12, 2021. (Id. at 167) Notwithstanding its\nacceptance of compensability, Defendants did not pay the medical costs for the kidney treatment.\n(DI. 1, Ex. A at JJ 26-31) Defendants\u2019 failure to pay caused the Plaintiff to make a written\nHuffman demand on July 22, 2021, pursuant to 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2357. (dd. at JJ 31-32); See\nHuffman v. C.C. Oliphant & Sons, 432 A.2d 1207 (Del. 1981).\n\nA Huffman demand provides an additional remedy to an employee in which the employee\nmay elect to proceed under 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2357 in a court of law rather than before the I.A.B. Jd.\nat 1210-1211. When the I.A.B. determines that certain medical expenses are compensable, the\ninjured employee may then demand payment from the employer or its insurer, and if this demand\nis not satisfied within 30 days, invoke the remedies available under Section 2357 by bringing a\ncivil suit in a court of competent jurisdiction. See Correa v. Pa. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n Ins. Co., 618 F.\nSupp. 915, 921 (D. Del. 1985).\u201d\n\nThe Plaintiff claims that, despite his Huffman demand, the kidney treatment bills\n\nremained unpaid, and the Plaintiff made six additional demands for payment through September\n\n6 Seeney v. Marvel Constr. Co., No. 1504254 (Del. L.A.B. July 20, 2021).\n\n719 Del. C. \u00a7 2357 provides that \u201cIf default is made by the employer for 30 days after demand in\nthe payment of any amount due under this chapter, the amount may be recovered in the same\nmanner as claims for wages are collectible.\u201d 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2357. Delaware\u2019s Wage Payment and\nCollection statute recites, in part, that an employer who, \u201cwithout any reasonable grounds for\ndispute, fails to pay an employee wages...shall, in addition, be liable to the employee for\nliquidated damages in the amount of 10 percent of the unpaid wages for each day, except Sunday\nand legal holidays, upon which such failure continues after the day upon which payment is\nrequired or in an amount equal to the unpaid wages, whichever is smaller...\u201d 19 Del. C. \u00a7\n1103(b). Failure to satisfy a Huffman demand also results in an award of attorney\u2019s fees and\ncosts to the injured employee. See Huffman, 432 A.2d at 1211.\n\n3\n22, 2021. (D.L. 1, Ex. A at J] 33-36, 38-39) Defendants represented to the I.A.B. that Plaintiff\nnever provided the Fresenius bills until after the time for appealing the I.A.B.\u2019s July 20, 2021\ndecision had expired. (D.I. 6, Ex. 2 at 1-2)* In a later hearing before the I.A.B. on September 8,\n2021, the Defendants confirmed receipt of the bills as of that date. (/d. at 2) However, in the\ninterim, on August 24, 2021, Plaintiff recorded the 1.A.B.\u2019s July 20, 2021 award of worker\u2019s\ncompensation benefits as a judgment in the Superior Court following the expiration of the appeal\nperiod in accordance with 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2349.9 (D.I. 34 at 3) Thereafter, on September 30, 2021,\nPlaintiff commenced the instant lawsuit in the Superior Court. (D.I. 1, Ex. A) Plaintiff asserts\nclaims for the failure to satisfy the Huffman demand in violation of 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2357, bad faith\nbreach of contract, and seeks a declaratory judgment, compensatory and punitive damages,\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs, all arising from Defendants alleged deficiencies in payment of\nPlaintiff's worker\u2019s compensation benefits. (Id.)\n\nThe Delaware Superior Court docket reflects that service of process was made on the\nDelaware Insurance Commissioner pursuant to 18 Del. C. \u00a7 525(a). The Superior Court docket\nreflects the Insurance Commissioner received service for INA and ACE on October 5, 2021, and\nESIS on October 12, 2021. (D.I. 8 at ff 2-3, Ex. A) The record further indicates that the\nInsurance Commissioner\u2019s office transmitted service of process to Defendant ACE\u2019s registered\n\nagent on October 6, 2021.!\u00b0 (D.I. 1, Ex. A) Plaintiff was unable to secure service of process on\n\n8 Seeney v. Marvel Constr. Co., No. 1504254 (Del. I.A.B. Nov. 4, 2021).\n\n9 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2349 provides, in part, that \u201cWhenever an award shall become final and conclusive\npursuant to this section, the prevailing party, at any time after the running of all appeal periods,\nmay, if a proper appeal has not been filed, file with the prothonotary's office, for the county\nhaving jurisdiction over the matter, the amount of the award and the date of the award.\u201d 19 Del.\nC. \u00a7 2349.\n\n'0 The record does not contain a similar letter indicating the date the Delaware Insurance\nCommissioner mailed service to INA and ESIS.\n\n4\nDefendant Chubb Limited, and this Defendant was dismissed without prejudice on March 7,\n2022. (D.L. 31)\n\nOn October 26, 2021, before the case was removed from Superior Court, Plaintiff\nobtained a final partial default judgment against Defendants INA and ACE for the liquidated\namount of Plaintiffs alleged Huffman action for payment of the I.A.B.\u2019s award of worker\u2019s\ncompensation benefits pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(1).\n(D.I. 36) On the same date, Plaintiff moved for default judgment on the unliquidated bad faith\nclaim pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2). (D.I. 35)\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Defendants jointly removed this action to this court pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1441(a), and 1446(a), based on diversity of citizenship. (DI. 1) On November\n4, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion seeking to remand the action back to state court. (D.I. 3)\nPlaintiff then filed a motion to amend the motion to remand on November 8, 2021. (D.I. 6)\n\nFollowing removal, Defendants filed an answer to Plaintiff's complaint on November 9,\n2021 and a response in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for default on November 10, 2021. (D.I.\n7; D.I. 8) On November 19, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion to strike Defendants\u2019 answer and their\nopposition to Plaintiffs motion for default. (D.I. 9) On February 2, 2022, Defendants filed a\nmotion to vacate the partial default judgment. (D.I. 26) Oral argument on the pending motions\n\nwas held on March 22, 2022.\n\nTW. LEGAL STANDARD\na. Motion to Remand\nA party may remove a case from state court to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 if the\nmatter is one over which the federal court has original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). If\n\njurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, complete diversity must exist and the amount in\ncontroversy must exceed $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). Ifjurisdiction no longer exists at any\ntime after a case has been removed, the federal court shall remand the case back to state court.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). Further, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c) prohibits removal of any state action arising\nunder state workmen\u2019s compensation law even if it presents a federal question or there is\ncomplete diversity and the amount in controversy is met. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c) (\u201c{a] civil action\nin any State court arising under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of such State may not be\nremoved to any district court of the United States\u201d); see Humphrey v. Sequentia, Inc., 58 F.3d\n1238, 1244-45 (8th Cir. 1995); see also Spearman v. Exxon Coal USA, Inc., 16 F.3d 722, 724\n(7th Cir. 1994); see also Jones v. Roadway Exp., Inc., 931 F.2d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir. 1991).\nb. Motion to Strike\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), \u201c[t]he court may strike from a pleading any\ninsufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(f). Motions to strike serve \u201cto clean up the pleadings, streamline litigation, and avoid\nunnecessary forays into immaterial matters.\u201d The Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Norma Espinosa\n2007-1 Ins. Tr., C.A. No. 09-300-LPS, 2011 WL 710970, at *4 (D. Del. Feb. 22, 2011) (citing\nMcInerney v. Mayer Lumber & Hardware, Inc., 244 F. Supp. 2d 393, 402 (E.D. Pa. 2002)).\nDistrict courts are afforded \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d when addressing a motion to strike. Yellow\nBook Sales & Distribution Co., Inc. v. White, 2011 WL 830520, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 10, 2011).\nHowever, granting a motion to strike is generally disfavored and considered \u201ca drastic remedy to\nbe resorted to only when required for the interests of justice.\u201d Plaum v. Jefferson Pilot Fin. Ins.\nCo., 2004 WL 2980415, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 22, 2004). Even where the challenged material is\nredundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous, a motion to strike should not be granted\n\nunless the moving party shows that the allegations have no possible relation to the controversy\nand will prejudice the moving party. Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Aruba Networks, Inc., 609 F. Supp.\n2d 353, 359 (D. Del. 2009) (internal quotations omitted); see also Rechsteiner v. Madison Fund,\nInc., 75 F.R.D. 499, 505 (D. Del. 1977). When ruling on a motion to strike, the court must\nconstrue all facts in favor of the nonmoving party, and only grant the motion when the allegation\nis clearly insufficient. Juniper Networks, Inc. v. Palo Alto Networks, Inc., 881 F. Supp. 2d 603,\n605 (D. Del. 2012).\nce. Vacating Motion for Default and Default Judgment\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) provides that the court \u201cmay set aside an entry of\ndefault for good cause, and ... may set aside a final default judgment under Rule 60(b).\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 55(c). Rule 60(b) provides that the court may relieve a party from final judgment and\nsets forth six independent grounds for granting such relief, including mistake, inadvertence,\nsurprise, or excusable neglect under Rule 60(b){1), or a void judgment under Rule 60(b)(4).\n\nGenerally, entries of default and default judgments are disfavored by the courts, and\nwhen a defendant moves to set aside the entry of default or a default judgment, the law\n\u201crequire[s] [that] doubtful cases to be resolved in favor of the party moving to set aside the\ndefault judgment \u2018so that cases may be decided on their merits.\u2019\u201d United States v. $55,518.55 in\nU.S. Currency, 728 F.2d 192, 194-95 (3d Cir.1984) (citation omitted). Moreover, the \u201cdecision\nto set aside the entry of default pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c) and a default judgment pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) is left primarily to the discretion of the district court.\u201d Jd. at 194.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\na. Plaintiff's Motion to Remand\nPlaintiff argues that Counts IV, V, and VI of the complaint relating to the Huffman action\n\npursuant to 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2357, assert claims arising under Delaware\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation\nLaw (\u201cWCL\u201d), therefore, they are not subject to removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c). (D.L. 3)\nPlaintiff does not support this argument with any case authorities from this Circuit. (Id.)\nMoreover, the District Court has previously ruled in Correa v. Pa. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n Ins. Co. that an\nemployee may \u201cmaintain a suit to redress intentional and bad faith conduct by either an employer\nor the employer\u2019s insurance carrier in delaying or terminating worker\u2019s compensation benefit\npayments, notwithstanding the exclusivity provision of the Delaware worker\u2019s compensation\nstatute, 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2304.\u201d Correa, 618 F. Supp. at 924-25.\n\nA Huffman demand had not been made in Correa, therefore, the District Court did not\naddress whether that would have affected the Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to maintain a bad faith action. Id.\nat 921-22. However, in Pierce v. Int'l Ins. Co. of Ill., the Delaware Supreme Court found the\nreasoning of Correa persuasive and likewise ruled that an employee, as a third-party beneficiary\nof his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance contract, may maintain a civil action against\na workers\u2019 compensation insurer who violates the duty of good faith and fair dealing when it\ndelays or terminates payment of a claim in bad faith. Pierce v. Int\u2019l Ins. Co. of Ill.,671 A.2d\n1361, 1362 (Del. 1996). The court\u2019s rationale is that the bad faith claim is based upon conduct\nof the insurer that occurred after the work-related accident, thus, the exclusivity provision of the\nWCL is inapplicable. Jd. at 1365.\n\nMost recently in Ford v. Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Servs., Inc., the Delaware Superior\nCourt, in a decision affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, ruled that a Huffman clam arises\nfrom the employer or insurer\u2019s failure to pay benefits upon demand, thus, it is based on claims\nhandling conduct and \u201cis not an event that can be considered one in the same as the original\n\nworkplace injury.\u201d Ford v. Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 WL 2557141, at *6 (Del.\nSuper. Ct. May 20, 2020). Ford holds that both the Huffman action and the bad faith action must\nbe brought in the same civil suit to avoid the prohibition on \u201cclaim splitting.\u201d Id. at *6-7.\n\nPlaintiffs reliance on 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2322F(h) to satisfy the requirement of Section 1445(c)\nfor remanding a cause of action \u201carising under\u201d the WCL misinterprets the medical bill invoice\npayment provision of the WCL. (D.L 6 at 3-4) All that Section 2322F(h) accomplishes is to set\na 30-day period for the compensation insurer to pay a health care provider\u2019s bill unless there is a\n\u201cgood faith\u201d basis to challenge the bill. 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2322F(h). The mention of \u201cgood faith\u201d\ndoes not give the L.A.B. authority to adjudicate bad faith claims against the insurer, nor does it\nprovide any remedy for bad faith claims handling, such as punitive damages. Jd. Significantly,\nit does not alter the analysis that unjustified or deficient claims handling by the worker\u2019s\ncompensation insurer is actionable conduct independent of the original workplace injury. See 19\nDel. C. \u00a7 2357.\n\nThe foregoing authorities unequivocally establish that Huffman and bad faith actions fall\noutside of the exclusivity provisions of the WCL and may be asserted together in a civil suit ina\ncourt of competent jurisdiction. See Huffman, 432 A.2d at 1210 (holding that a claim under 19\nDel. C. \u00a7 2357 invokes 19 Del. C. \u00a7 1113(a), which \u201cgrants jurisdiction over such cases to \u2018any\ncourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d). They do not \u201carise under\u201d the WCL because they are based\non independent conduct in claims handling by the insurer that occurs after the industrial accident.\nFord, 2020 WL 2557141, at *6. Therefore, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c) is not a bar to removal of the\naction on these combined claims to the District Court. Plaintiff's argument to the contrary is\n\nwithout merit, and the court recommends denying the motion to remand.\nb. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants\u2019 Answer and to Strike Defendants\u2019\nOpposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Default\n\nThe Plaintiff moves to strike Defendants\u2019 answer filed after removal and preclude\nDefendants from setting aside or opposing Plaintiffs partial default judgment and motion for\ndefault judgment which were filed in the Delaware Superior Court prior to removal. (D.I. 9) In\nthe motion to strike, Plaintiff fails to acknowledge that Defendants\u2019 removal was timely under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b) (\u201cThe notice of removal...shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the\ndefendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading\u201d) and their answer was\ntimely under Rule 81(c)(2)(C) (\u201cA defendant who did not answer before removal must answer or\npresent other defenses...within...7 days after the notice of removal is filed\u201d). Moreover,\nPlaintiff fails to acknowledge that the Defendant, ESIS, was not defaulted nor was it included in\nthe pending motion for default judgment prior to its joinder in removal to the District Court.\n\n(D.L. 35-36) Thus, the motion to strike has no effect on ESIS\u2019 timely removal, appearance, and\nanswer to the complaint.\n\nPlaintiff misapprehends the court\u2019s jurisdiction and procedural rules following removal.\nPlaintiff incorrectly argues that this court can only address the validity of the partial default\njudgment and motion for default judgment based on application of the Delaware Superior Court\nRules of Civil Procedure applicable to an entry of appearance for a party and the twenty-day time\n\nperiod for responding to a complaint.!! (D.I. 10 at 7-14)\n\n'l Del. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 5(aa)(1) provides that \u201cAppearance may be made by the service and\nfiling of notice thereof, or by the service or filing of any motion or pleading purporting to be\nresponsive to, or affecting the complaint, except that appearance for purpose of satisfying a\njudgment, when appearance may be made by notation thereof on the judgment docket.\u201d Del.\nSuper. Ct. Civ. R. 12(a) provides that \u201ca defendant shall serve an answer within 20 days after\nservice of process, complaint and affidavit, if any, upon that defendant.\u201d\n\n10\nHowever, the federal court \u201ctakes the case as it finds it on removal and treats everything\nthat occurred in the state court as if it had taken place in federal court.\u201d Maggiore v. Barensfeld,\n2011 WL 1811067, at *2 (N.D. Ohio May 12, 2011) (quoting Butner v. Neustadter, 324 F.2d\n783, 785 (9th Cir. 1963)). Accordingly, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are the only\nprocedural rules the court applies to a removed action.\n\nPlaintiff begins by arguing that it was improper for the Defendants to file an answer to\nthe complaint because of the existence of a final default judgment entered in the Superior Court\non August 24, 2021, based on an underlying I.A.B. award of worker\u2019s compensation benefits to\nthe Plaintiff. (D.I. 10 at 8) However, the complaint in the instant case was filed in the Superior\nCourt on September 30, 2021. (D.I. 1, Ex. A) The complaint makes no mention of the default\njudgment of August 24, 2021, notwithstanding the overlapping facts concerning unpaid worker\u2019s\ncompensation benefits which are the subject matter of the instant suit. (/d.) Therefore, any\ndefault judgment entered before this case started is not part of the removed action and has no\nrelevance to the resolution of the pending motions in this case.\n\nPlaintiff further contends that a partial default judgment entered by the Superior Court on\nOctober 26, 2021, on the liquidated damages counts in the complaint prohibits the Defendants\nfrom filing an answer to the complaint. (D.I. 10 at 8-14) The Plaintiff relies on the Maggiore\ndecision, in which the federal court remanded the case to state court because removal was\nunavailable to save the Defendant from a default judgment that had already been entered as a\nfinal judgment by the state court prior to removal. Maggiore, 2011 WL 1811067, at *3-4.\nHowever, Maggiore is inapplicable if the default judgment is defective or may be vacated. See,\ne.g., Burroughs v. Palumbo, 871 F. Supp. 870, 872 (E.D. Va. 1994). In Burroughs, the\n\nDefendant timely filed a notice of removal after the expiration of time for filing an answer in\n\n11\nstate court but before a default judgment had been entered against him. Jd. at 871. In the short\nwindow of time following removal but before the notice of removal was provided, the state court\nentered a default in appearance. Jd. The Defendant asked the federal court to set aside the\ndefault on the grounds that the state court had lost jurisdiction to enter it due to removal to\nfederal court. Jd. The federal court ruled that the gap in time created a situation where the\njurisdiction of the state and federal court was \u201cconcurrent,\u201d and the case had been removed with\nthe default in appearance intact. Jd. However, because the default had not been reduced to a\nfinal judgment and the Defendant established a reasonable basis to set it aside, there was no\nrequirement to remand the case. Jd. at 871-873.\n\nHere, it is undisputed that two of the three removing Defendants were out of time to file\nan answer in Superior Court but timely removed the case to District Court. (DI. 8 at ff 2-3, Ex.\nA); see Del. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(a); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). Furthermore, following\nremoval, an answer to the complaint was filed within the seven-day period required by Rule\n81(c)(2)(C). Even if the court accepts Plaintiff's argument that a final partial default judgment\nwas intact when this case was removed, Plaintiff fails to explain any basis under the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure for striking the removing Defendants\u2019 answer to the bad faith counts in\nthe complaint that were not part of that default judgment. Similarly, Plaintiff fails to provide any\nauthority for striking Defendants\u2019 opposition to the pending motion for default on the bad faith\ncounts of the complaint. Therefore, the court recommends denying Plaintiff's motion to strike\nDefendants\u2019 answer and opposition briefs following the removal of the case to this court.\n\nc. Cross-Motions Regarding Default Judgments\nHaving recommended that the case has been properly removed and should not be\n\nremanded, the court must make a recommendation as to which counts of the complaint remain to\n\n12\nbe litigated. The court applies federal procedural rules to determine if the default judgment\nshould be vacated and motion for default denied. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(1) (\u201cThese [federal]\nrules apply to a civil action after it is removed from a State court\u201d).\n\nBefore removal, the partial default judgment and motion for default judgment were both\nfiled on October 26, 2021. (D.I. 35; D.I. 36) Each was supported by the affidavit of Plaintiff's\ncounsel verifying proper service of process was completed on October 5, 2021. (D.I. 35 at 12\n10-13; D.I. 36 at 4.2) In each of the affidavits, Plaintiff's counsel represented that Defendants\u2019\nanswers were due by October 25, 2021, and they had not responded within that time. (/d.)\n\nHowever, Plaintiff made a mistake in calculating the deadline for the Defendants\u2019\nresponsive pleading. Plaintiff failed to incorporate the additional three days for completion of\nservice of process on an insurer when process is served on the Insurance Commissioner pursuant\nto 18 Del. C. \u00a7 525(b).!* Giving the Plaintiff the benefit of the shortest time frame, the\nDefendants had at least until October 28, 2021 (October 5 plus three days plus 20 days) to\nrespond to the complaint. Accordingly, the default judgment and motion for default judgment\nwere filed prematurely and are void under Rule 60(b)(4). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) (\u201cOn\nmotion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final\njudgment, order, or proceeding\u201d if \u201cthe judgment is void\u201d).\n\nIn their supporting and opposing arguments on the motion to vacate the default judgment,\n\nboth sides argue the wrong factors under Rule 55(c) and Rule 60(b)(1).'3 (See D.I. 26 at 1, 3-7;\n\n'2 18 Del. C. \u00a7 525(b) provides that \u201cUpon such service the Commissioner shall forthwith mail\nby certified mail 1 of the copies of such process to the person currently designated by the insurer\nto receive the same as provided in \u00a7 524(e) of this title. Service of such process shall not be\ncomplete until 3 days after the same has been so mailed.\u201d 18 Del. C. \u00a7 525(b) (emphasis added).\n3 On a motion to set aside a default under Rule 55(c) or a default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1),\nthe court must consider the following three factors: \u201c(1) whether the plaintiff will be prejudiced;\n(2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) whether the default was the result of\n\n13\nSee D.I. 27 at 6-10) The analysis under Rule 55(c) or Rule 60(b)(1) only applies when the\ndefault judgment was authorized and the \u201conly question before the district court is whether to\nexercise its discretion to set aside the default.\u201d Gold Kist, 756 F.2d at 19; see U.S. v. One\nToshiba Color T.V., 213 F.3d 147, 156-58 (3d Cir. 2000). If the default judgment was\nimproperly entered, the district court would err in not setting it aside. Jd. Here, as in Gold Kist,\nthe time for filing an answer had not expired, thus, the default judgment was improperly entered,\nand the court recommends vacating it and denying Plaintiff's motion for default judgment,\npursuant to Rule 60(b)(4).\n\nIn accordance with the court\u2019s recommendations, which are dependent upon adoption by\nthe District Judge, the next step in this case is for the parties to engage in the Rule 26(f)\nconference so the matter may be set for a Rule 16 scheduling conference. A separate scheduling\norder shall issue.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court recommends DENYING Plaintiffs motion to\n\nremand (D.I. 3; D.I. 6) and motion to strike (D.I. 9) and GRANTING Defendants\u2019 motion to\n\nvacate the partial default judgment (D.I. 26).\n\nee Moti CO ecommendation!
