HERMAN,\nDefendants.C.A.NO. 20-1055-LPS\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nAt Wilmington this 28th day of February, 2022;\nPending before the Court is Defendants Christiue Harada (\"Harada\"), David Hanlon\n(\"Hanlon\"), Steven D. Croxton (\"Croxton\"), Eyal Hen (\"Hen\"), and Robert A. Herman's\n(\"Herman,\" and collectively with Harada, Hanlon, Croxton, and Hen, \"Defendants\") motion for\nreconsideration of the Court's order entered on September 28,2021 (D.I. 23) denying\nDefendants' motion to dismiss (D.I. 15) Plaintiffs Suzaime Loughlin (\"Loughlin\"), Harry Rhulen\n(\"Rhulen\"), and James Satterfield's (\"Satterfield,\" and collectively with Loughlin and Rhulen,\n\"Plaintiffs\") amended complaint (D.I. 12). The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions\n{see, e.g., D.I. 27, 29, 31). For the reasons explained below, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that\nDefendants' motion for reconsideration (D.I. 27) is DENIED.\n1. A motion for reconsideration is govemed by Local Rule 7.1.5. See, e.g., Helios\nSoftware, LLC v. Awareness Techs., Inc., 2014 WL 906346, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 5,2014). A\nmotion for reconsideration \"must rely on one of three grounds: (1) an intervening change in\n1controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of\nlaw or fact or to prevent manifest injustice.\" Parkell v. Frederick, 2019 WL 1435884, at *1 (D.\nDel. Mar. 31,2019) (internal citation omitted). Reconsideration may be appropriate where \"the\nCourt has patently misimderstood a party, or has made a decision outside the adversarial issues\npresented to the court by the parties, or has made an error not of reasoning but of apprehension.\"\nWood V. Galef-Surdo, 2015 WL 479205, at *1 (D. Del. Jan. 26,2015) (internal citation omitted).\nWhile the decision on a motion for reconsideration is within the discretion of the Court, such\nmotions \"should only be granted sparinglyF Kavanagh v. Keiper Recaro Seating, Inc., 2003\nWL 22939281, at *1 (D. Del. July 24,2003) (emphasis added).i\n2. The Court did not make a clear error in denying Defendants' motion to dismiss\nPlaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim. Defendants contend that the Court erred by failing to\n\"recognize[] that Plaintiffs suffered no injury in their shareholder capacity and were owed no\nduties as warrant holders.\" (D.1.27 at 6) The Court disagrees. In Loughlin v. Goord, 2021 WL\n3932616, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1,2021), a decision relied on by Defendants, the court explained\n^ Regrettably, neither party complied with the Local Rules governing the filing of a motion for\nreconsideration. First, Defendants' motion was imtimely filed. Defendants mistakenly styled\ntheir motion as a \"Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration.\" Rule 59(e) governs \"[a] motion to\nalter or amend a judgment,\" but the Court's denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss is not an\nentry of \"judgment\" contemplated by Rule 59(e). The deadline for filing a motion for\nreconsideration is \"14 days after the Court issues its opinion or decision.\" D. Del. LR 7.1.5(a).\nDefendants' motion, however, was filed on October 21, 2021, 23 days after the challenged\ndecision was issued. (See D.1.27) Then, Plaintiffs filed an rmtimely response. A response to a\nmotion for reconsideration should be filed \"[wjithin 14 days after filing of such motion.\" D. Del.\nLR 7.1.5(a). Plaintiffs filed their opposition on November 11,2021,21 days after Defendants\nfiled their motion, without providing any explanation as to why the response could not have been\ntimely filed. (See D.I. 29) Then, 27 days after Plaintiffs filed their response. Defendants filed a\n\"reply\" on December 8,2021. (See D.I. 31) A reply brief is not an authorized submission in\nconnection with a motion for reconsideration. See D. Del. LR 7.1.5(a). Even assuming\nDefendants viewed their motion as being governed by Rixle 59(e), their reply brief would have\nbeen due \"within 7 days\" after Plaintiffs' response was filed and was, even by this standard,\nuntimely. D. Del. LR 7.1.2(b).that \"Plaintiffs at oral argument narrowed their claim of breach of fiduciary duty to a single\ndecision - the decision not to honor Plaintiffs' warrants.\" In this case, by contrast, the Court\nconsidered the entirety of Defendants' alleged misconduct in the \"retaliation campaign\" and\nconcluded that \"[w]hile the purported 'retaliation campaign' resulted, in part, in Plaintiffs being\nunable to exercise warrants, the alleged fiduciary breaches go beyond merely 'blocking\nPlaintiffs' efforts to exercise or transfer their warrants' (D.I. 16 at 9).\" Loughlin v. Harada, 2021\nWL 4439539, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 28,2021). Furthermore, in this case. Plaintiffs requested\ndamages \"in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than\" the damages resulting from\nPlaintiffs being unable to exercise warrants. (D.I. 12 ^ 80) There is no indication that Plaintiffs\nhave limited their harm to \"the exact amount of warrants,\" as occurred in the state trial court\ndecision in Loughlin v. de Bary. (See D.I. 27 Ex. 4) Here, therefore, the Court found, and\ncontinues to find, that Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim is \"based on Plaintiffs' capacity\nnot as warrant holders, but as shareholders.\" Harada, 2021 WL 4439539, at *3.\nIn connection with the pending motion for reconsideration. Defendants argue, for the first\ntime, that the \"allegations of Defendants' participation in a 'retaliatory scheme' failQ to rebut the\nbusiness judgment rule.\" (D.I. 27 at 6) This argument does not form an appropriate basis for\nreconsideration because Defendants could have made this argument on their motion to dismiss\nbut failed to do so.^ See Tucker v. Sec 'y of Health & Human Servs., 782 F. App'x 223,224-25\n(3d Cir. 2019); see also Amgen Inc. v. Amneal Pharms LLC, 2018 WL 1885664, at *5 (D. Del.\nApr. 19,2018) (\"A new argument is not the proper subject of a motion for reargument.\").\n^ Defendants show in their reply brief on the motion for reconsideration that they invoked the\nbusiness judgment rule in their opening brief in support of the motion for reconsideration. (See\nD.I. 31 at 2) (citing D.I. 27 at 6-7) Defendants fail, however, to demonstrate that they made\narguments based on the business judgment rule in connection with their motion to dismiss,\nwhich renders these arguments improper on a motion for reconsideration.In any event, the factual allegations in the amended complaint - accepted as trae and\nviewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs - allow for a plausible inference that Defendants'\nparticipation in the \"retaliation campaign\" against Plaintiffs has gone \"so far beyond the bounds\nof reasonable business judgment\" that its only explanation is bad faith. Parnes v. Bally Entm 't\nCorp., 722 A.2d 1243,1246 (Del. 1999). Bad faith is a sufficient basis to overcome the\npresumption of the business judgment rule. See In re Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litig., 906\nA.2d 27,52 (Del. 2006) (\"Those presumptions [of the business judgment rule] can be rebutted if\nthe plaintiff shows that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or of loyalty or acted in\nbad faith.\").^\n3. With respect to Plaintiffs' libel claim, contrary to Defendants' contention, there is\nno intervening change in controlling law. Defendants' reliance on both Goord and de Bary to\njustify reconsideration is misplaced. {See D.l. 27 at 8-10) On state law issues, decisions from a\nstate's lower courts or from federal district courts applying state law, while potentially helpful in\npredicting how the state's highest court would rule on the issues, do not constitute controlling\nlaw that binds this Court. In this case, since neither Goord nor de Bary was issued by the New\nYork Court of Appeals, they do not represent an intervening change in controlling law for\npurposes of Defendants' motion for reconsideration.\nAdditionally, the issue of whether Defendants' 10-Q statement should be afforded\nqualified privilege (as opposed to litigation privilege) - the dispositive issue for dismissing\n^ Defendants contend that Plaintiffs would need to rebut the \"presumed independence and\ndisinterestedness of a majority of Rekor's Board.\" (D.l. 27 at 7) The business judgment rule,\nhowever, does not shield independent and disinterested directors who act in bad faith by\n\"intentionally act[ing] with a purpose other than that of advancing the best interests of the\ncorporation,\" misconduct that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged in the amended complaint. See\nIn re Walt Disney Co., 906 A.2d at 67.Plaintiffs' libel claim in Goord - was not before the Court on the motion to dismiss in this case/\nDefendants' privilege argument was based solely on their then-imminent litigation against\nPlaintiffs (see, e.g., D.I. 16 at 19, D.I. 21 at 6), an argument that has been considered and rejected\nby this Court (and by the Goord court, too). See Harada, 2021 WL 4439539, at *6; Goord, 2021\nWL 3932616, at * 12-14. Defendants do not explain why they could not have argued, on the\nmotion to dismiss, that the 10-Q statement should be afforded qualified privilege in a context\nunrelated to a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding. Even after the Goord Court sua sponte\nraised the qualified privilege issue for oral argument^ and dismissed the libel claim on that\nground - a decision issued nearly fom weeks before this Court rendered its ruling on\nDefendants' motion to dismiss in this case - Defendants neither filed a notice of subsequent\nauthority nor requested leave for supplemental briefing to address the applicability of qualified\nprivilege. The Court finds no justification to consider Defendants' qualified privilege argument\non the motion for reconsideration.\nEven assuming, however, that the disputed 10-Q statement is subject to qualified\nprivilege - an issue that the New York Court of Appeals has not yet addressed - Plaintiffs have\nalleged facts sufficient to defeat that privilege at this stage of the case. The record that the Court\nmay consider does not allow it to conclude that the 10-Q statement at issue - that the execution\nThe Court disagrees with de Bary and continues to find - as did Goord - that Defendants\ncannot avoid liability by arguing that the 10-Q statement restated Rekor's historical position or\nthat it is a protected opinion. (See D.I. 27 Ex. 4; see also Harada, 2021 WL 4439539, at *4-5;\nGoord, 2021 WL 3932616, at *10-12)\n^ In the order scheduling oral argument on Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Goord Court\nstated: \"At argument the parties should be prepared to discuss whether the allegedly libelous\nstatement on Rekor's August 14,2019 10-Q is subject to any qualified privilege and the\napplicability of Chapadeau v. Utica Observer-Dispatch, Inc., 341 N.E.2d 569 (N.Y. 1975) to\nthat statement.\" (Loughlin v. Goord, 1:20-cv-6357-LJL-KNF (S.D.N.Y.) D.I. 23)of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement had been fraudulently induced by Plaintiffs {see\nD.l. 12187) - falls within the scope of Defendants' disclosure obligations. Given the facts\nalleged in the amended complaint surroundiug Defendants' purported \"retaliation campaign,\" it\nis not implausible that \"the one and only cause for the publication\" of the allegedly libelous 10-Q\nstatement was Defendants' \"spite or ill will\" to defame Plaintiffs. See Liberman v. Gelstein, 605\nN.E.2d 344,349-50 (N.Y. 1992).\n4. The Court is not persuaded that \"the overarching principles of justice and fairness\ncompel the Court to reconsider its denial\" of Defendants' motion to dismiss. (D.l. 27 at 10)\nDefendants do not contend that Goord and de Bary have an issue preclusive effect on Plaintiffs'\nclaims asserted in the amended complaint. As explained above, both the scope of disputes\ninvolved and the arguments presented in this case are different from those in the cases relied on\nby Defendants. It is, thus, neither unjust nor unfair that the Court has reached a different\noutcome on Defendants' motion to dismiss in this case.\nHONORABLE LEONARD P. STARK\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE"}
