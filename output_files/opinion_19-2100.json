Barry, III, KRATZ & BARRY, Atlanta, Georgia \nAttorneys for Defendant Alkem Laboratories Ltd. \nNovember 16, 2021 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION ~~i,t\u00b1Y \nIn this action arising under the Hatch-Waxman Act, Azurity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1 \n(\"Azurity\" or \"Plaintiff') asserts claims of seven patents against Alkem Laboratories Ltd. \n(\"Alkem\" or \"Defendant\") in relation to Alkem's application to market a generic version of \nAzurity's Epaned\u00ae before the patents-in-suit expire. (D.I. 1; D.I. 39) Epaned\u00ae is an \nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat hypertension , heart failure, and \nasymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. (D.I.39113) The patents-in-suit cover oral liquid \nformulations of enalapril, the active ingredient in Epaned\u00ae. (See D.I. 72 at 1-2) \nThe parties dispute five claim terms that appear in one or more of three patents: U.S. \nPatent Nos. 10,772,868 (the \"'868 patent\"), 10,786,482 (the '\"482 patent\"), and 10,918,621 (the \n'\"621 patent\"). These three patents share a common specification. The parties submitted a joint \nclaim construction brief (D.I. 72) and exhibits (D.I. 51-1, D.I. 73). The Court held a claim \nconstruction hearing on August 23, 2021, at which both sides presented oral argument. (D.1. 79) \n(\"Tr.\") \nI. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nThe ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question of law. See \nTeva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318,321 (2015) (citing Markman v. Westview \nInstruments , Inc. (\"Markman If'), 517 U.S. 370, 388-91 (1996)). \"It is a bedrock principle of \npatent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the \nright to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWHCorp. , 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for conducting \n1 Azurity was substituted for Silvergate Pharmaceuticals , Inc. on June 11, 2021. (D.1. 59) claim construction.\" Id at 1324. The Court is free to attach the appropriate weight to \nappropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\" Id. \n\"[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning, \" \nwhich is \"the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art \n[(\"POSA\")] in question at the time of the invention , i.e., as of the effective filing date of the \npatent application.\" Id at 1312-13 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he ordinary meaning \nof a claim term is its meaning to the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\" Id. at 13 21 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). The patent \"specification is always highly relevant to the \nclaim construction analysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning \nof a disputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \nWhile \"the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of \nparticular claim terms,\" the context of the surrounding words of the claim also must be \nconsidered. Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. Furthermore, \"[o]ther claims of the patent in question, \nboth asserted and unasserted , can also be valuable sources of enlightenment\" because \"claim \nterms are normally used consistently throughout the patent.\" Id. \nIt is likewise true that \"[d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide.\" Id. \"For \nexample, the presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a \npresumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id. at 1314-\n15. This presumption of claim differentiation is \"especially strong when the limitation in dispute \nis the only meaningful difference between an independent and dependent claim, and one party is \nurging that the limitation in the dependent claim should be read into the independent claim.\" \nSunRace Roots Enter. Co. v. SRAMCorp ., 336 F.3d 1298, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \n2 It is also possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim \nterm by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the \ninventor's lexicography governs.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. It bears emphasis that \"[e]ven \nwhen the specification describes only a single embodiment , the claims of the patent will not be \nread restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope \nusing words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction. \" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker \nCorp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) . \nIn addition to the specification , a court should \"consider the patent's prosecution history, \nif it is in evidence .\" Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc. (\"Markman I\"), 52 F.3d 967, 980 \n(Fed. Cir. 1995) ( en bane), ajf'd, 517 U.S. 3 70 (1996). The prosecution history, which is \n\"intrinsic evidence ,\" \"consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the [U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\" \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. \"[T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim \nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor \nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution , making the claim scope narrower than it \nwould otherwise be.\" Id. \nSometimes, \"the district court will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence \nand to consult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or \nthe meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Teva, 574 U.S. at 331. \n\"Extrinsic evidence consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimon y, dictionaries , and learned treatises. \" Markman I, 52 \nF.3d at 980. For instance, technical dictionaries can assist the court in determining the ordinary \nand customary meaning of a term because such dictionaries \"endeavor to collect the accepted \n3 meanings of terms used in various fields of science and technology .\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1318. \nIn addition, expert testimony can be useful \"to ensure that the court's understanding of the \ntechnical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish \nthat a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.\" \nId. Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \"expert reports and testimony [are] \ngenerated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer from bias that is not \npresent in intrinsic evidence.\" Id. Overall, while extrinsic evidence \"may be useful to the \ncourt,\" it is \"less reliable\" than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \"is unlikely to result in a \nreliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the intrinsic \nevidence.\" Id. at 1318-19. Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope of the \npatented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper. See Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. \nHewlett-Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1583). \nFinally, \"[t]he construction that stays true to the claim language and most naturally aligns \nwith the patent's description of the invention will be, in the end, the correct construction .\" \nRenishaw PLC v. Marposs SpA, 158 F.3d 1243, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1998). It follows that \"a claim \ninterpretation that would exclude the inventor's device is rarely the correct interpretation.\" \nOsrarn GrnbHv. Int'! Trade Comm'n, 505 F.3d 1351, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \n4 II. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS \nA. \"a buffer\"2 \nPlaintiff \n\"one or more buffers\" \nDefendant \n\"one buffer\" \nCourt \n\"one or more buffers\" \nThe parties dispute whether the claimed buffer is limited to just one buffer or may \ncontain one or more buffers. In some claims, \"a buffer\" follows the transitional phrase \n\"comprising,\" while in others it follows \"consisting essentially of.\"3 Despite this variation, the \nparties agree the term should be defined consistently across all of the claims at issue. (See Tr. at \n12-14, 19, 22-23) \n\"As a general rule, the words 'a' or 'an' in a patent claim carry the meaning of 'one or \nmore.\"' OJ Communique Lab., Inc. v. LogMein , Inc., 687 F.3d 1292, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2012). \n\"The exceptions to this rule are extremely limited: a patentee must evince a clear intent to limit \n'a' or 'an' to 'one.\"' Id. \"An exception to the general rule arises only 'where the language of the \nclaims themselves, the specification , or the prosecution history necessitate a departure from the \nrule.\"' Id. (quoting Baldwin Graphic Sys., Inc. v. Siebert, Inc., 512 F.3d 1338, 1342-43 (Fed. \nCir. 2008)). \nAs Alkem notes, this rule often arises in cases discussing claims with the open-ended \n\"comprising\" transitional term. (See D.I. 72 at 17-18) Courts have distinguished between \n2 This term appears in claims 1, 13, and 14 of the '868 patent, claims 1, 13, and 14 of the '482 \npatent, and claims 1, 19, and 30 of the '621 patent. \n3 Claims 1 and 14 of the '482 patent use \"comprising,\" while claim 13 of the '482 patent, claims \n1, 13, and 14 of the '868 patent, and claims 1, 19, and 30 of the '621 patent use \"consisting \nessentially of.\" \n5 \"comprising\" claims and \"consisting essentially of' claims. See PPG Indus. v. Guardian Indus. \nCorp., 156 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (\"A 'consisting essentially of claim occupies a \nmiddle ground between closed claims that are written in a 'consisting of format and fully open \nclaims that are drafted in a 'comprising ' format.\"). The \"consisting essentially of' phrase signals \nthat, while \"the invention necessarily includes the listed ingredients,\" it is also \"open to unlisted \ningredients that do not materially affect the basic and novel properties of the invention. \" Id. \nGiven its partially open nature, courts have noted that the \"consisting essentially of' phrase does \nnot necessarily restrict subsequent modified articles to a singular form. See Mylan Pharms., Inc. \nv. Kremers Urb. Dev. Co., 2004 WL 57218, at *4-5 (D. Del. Jan. 13, 2004). \nThus, despite the distinction between the two transitional phrases, the general rule that \n\"a\" in a patent claim means \"one or more\" provides support for Azurity's construction, in both \nthe \"consisting essentially of' claims and (even more strongly) in the \"comprising \" claims. \nThe patents' common specification offers further support for Azurity's proposal. As \nAzurity observes (see D.I. 72 at 9), the specification expressly defines \"a\" in its \"Certain \nDefinitions \" section: \nAs used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \"a\", \n\"an\", and \"the\" include plural reference unless the context clearly \ndictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \"an excipient \" \nis a reference to one or more excipients and equivalents thereof \nknown to those skilled in the art, and so forth. \n('482 patent at 29:20-25) Thus, based on both the law in general and the specification in \nparticular , \"a buffer\" is not limited in the claims to just one buffer \"unless the context clearly \ndictates otherwise.\" (Id.) \nAlkem argues the prosecution history provides such context, revealing (in its view) that \nthe patentee and examiner understood \"consisting essentially of' to exclude additional \n6 components , including more than one buffer. (D.I. 72 at 11-14) During prosecution of U.S. \nPatent No. 9,669,008 (the '\"008 patent\"), the parent patent of all the patents-in-suit , the patentee \ndistinguished the prior art by noting that the '008 patent required comparatively fewer \ncomponents. (D.I. 51-1 at Appx 121-22) To overcome a rejection based on obviousness , the \npatentee associated the phrase \"consisting essentiall y of' with a narrow set of ingredients , adding \nthat \"none of [ the prior art] references teach[ es] or suggest[ s] the claimed combination of only \nenalapril, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, sucralose and water at the recited \nconcentrations and pH as stated in claim 20.\" (Id. at Appx 117) Alkem argues these narrowing \nstatements constitute a disavowal of additional components , including multiple buffers. (D.I. 72 \nat 11-12) \nThe Court disagrees. While the patentee distinguished the '008 patent based on its \nrelatively limited number of ingredients , it never stated that a single buffer was a unique element \nof the claims. (See id. at 21) Instead, it simply argued that, while two relevant prior art \nreferences contained ten or more components in addition to enalapril and water, the formulation \nof the '008 patent claims had only four ingredients in addition to enalapril and water. (D.I. 51-1 \nat Appx 122) That the ingredients in the prior art may have included multiple buffers does not \nrender the patentee's statement a clear and unmistakable disavowal of multiple buffers. See \ngenerally MITv. Shire Pharms., Inc., 839 F.3d 1111, 1119 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (\"In order for \nprosecution disclaimer to attach, the disavowal must be both clear and unmistakable. \"). \nDefendant further asserts that the patentee similarly narrowed claim scope during \nprosecution of the '868 patent, of which the '621 patent is a continuation . (D.I. 72 at 13) The \nexaminer rejected what are now claims 1, 13, and 14 of the '868 patent as obvious in light of \nprior art references such as Nahata. (See D.I. 51-1 at Appx 221-23) In doing so, the examiner \n7 noted that the claimed invention was drawn to a formulation comprising a list of four \ningredients. (Id. at Appx 228) While the compositions claimed by Nahata comprised additional \ncomponents , the examiner emphasized the open-ended nature of the term \"comprising \" and \nstated \"there is no explicit proviso which would exclude the use of additional components in the \ninstantly claimed formulation. \" (Id. at Appx 228-29) The patentee subsequently amended \n\"comprising \" to \"consisting essentiall y of' and overcame the rejection. (Id. at Appx 245-49) \nAccordingly, Defendant argues the patentee disavowed any additional components, including \nmore than one buffer. (D.I. 72 at 13) \nThe Court, again, disagrees . While the amendment from \"comprising \" to \"consisting \nessentially of' narrowed the claim scope, the patentee chose not to use the even more closed \nphrase, \"consisting of.\" See PPG, 156 F.3d at 1354 (explaining that unlike \"consisting of,\" \n\"consisting essentially of' is \"open to unlisted ingredients that do not materially affect the basic \nand novel properties of the invention \"); see also Tr. at 27-29. A POSA would understand that \nthe resulting claim language -\"consisting essentiall y of ... a buffer\" -yields narrower claim \nscope than existed before the amendment (\"comprising ... a buffer\") but does not disclaim ( as \npart of the ongoing negotiation between the applicant and the examiner) all embodiments having \nmore than one buffer.4 See MIT, 839 F.3d at 1119 (\"Where the alleged disavowal is ... \namenable to multiple reasonable interpretations , we have declined to find prosecution \ndisclaimer. \") (internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of the instant prosecution \n4 Plaintiff also argues that the examiner 's rejection was based, at least in part, on the applicant's \nfailure to demonstrate unexpected results from buffers other than the single buffer combination \nrecited in the claims. (See D.I. 72 at 23-24) (citing D.I. 51-1 at Appx 221) In response, the \napplicant submitted an inventor declaration demonstrating unexpected results from several other \nbuffers. (See id.) ( citing D .I. 51-1 at Appx 23 6) \n8 history, the absence of any clear explanation by the patentee for the amendment does not result \nin a clear and unmistakable disavowal of multiple buffers. \nAlkem argues further that, since the '482 patent is a continuation of the '008 patent, and \nthe '621 patent is a continuation of both the '008 and '868 patents, the use of the phrase \n\"consisting essentially of' should be understood with reference to the '008 and '868 patents' \nprosecution history and, thus, should be read to exclude additional components . (D.I. 72 at 14; \nsee Andersen Corp. v. Fiber Composites , LLC, 474 F.3d 1361, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (\"The \nprosecution history of [a] parent application is highly instructive in light of the similarity \nbetween the claims of the application and those of the patents in suit.\")) Even if this principle is \ncorrect, it does not support the conclusion Alkem seeks. As the Court is not persuaded that the \nprosecution histories of the '008 or '868 patents contains a clear and unmistakable disavowal of \nmultiple buffers, the prosecution histories of the '482 and '621 patents cannot pick up from them \na nonexistent disclaimer. \nDefendant 's observation that \"the specification is silent as to whether multiple buffers are \ncontemplated\" (D.I. 72 at 19) does not mean that the claims exclude embodiments containing \nmultiple buffers. Nor do the facts that every embodiment in the specification uses a single buffer \nor that other components (e.g., buffering agents) are described with extensive lists that include \nmixtures (see id. at 16). Silence in a specification does not necessarily mean the undisclosed \nembodiment is excluded; claims are not limited to the embodiments expressly taught in a \nspecification . See, e.g., Seabed Geosolution s (US) Inc. v. Magseis FF LLC, 8 F.4th 1285, 1288 \n(Fed. Cir. 2021). \nFinally, Defendant suggests that Azurity's construction fails to sufficiently inform a \nPOSA as to the scope of the buffer concentration limitations. (See D.I. 72 at 14-15) The Court \n9 agrees, however, with Azurity that a POSA would understand from the plain language of the \nclaims that \"one or more buffers\" would together need to meet the amount required by the \nclaims. (See id. at 25-26; Tr. at 10)5 \nIn sum, there is nothing in the claims, specification, or prosecution history that warrants a \ndeparture from the general rule that \"a\" means \"one or more.\" See Baldwin Graphic, 512 F.3d at \n1342-43. \nB. \"a buffer to maintain the pH\"6 \nPlaintiff \n\"one or more buffers to maintain the pH\" \nDefendant \n\"one buffer that maintains the pH\" \nCourt \n\"one or more buffers to maintain the pH\" \nFor this term, the parties reiterate their arguments with respect to \"a buffer.\" (See D.I. 72 \nat 34-36; Tr. at 34-35) The Court, thus, incorporates its construction of \"a buffer\" (\"one or more \nbuffers\") into its construction of this term. Further, as Alkem conceded at the hearing, there is \nno compelling reason to alter the language of the claim term from \"to maintain the pH\" to \"that \nmaintains the pH,\" and the Court will not do so. (See Tr. at 35) \n5 Further, to the extent Defendant asserts an indefiniteness argument, the parties agreed to defer \nsuch arguments for trial and not to address them as part of these claim construction proceedings. \n(See D.I. 72 at 6) \n6 This term appears in claims 1, 13, and 14 of the '868 patent and claims 1, 19, and 30 of the \n'621 patent. \n10 C. \"a citrate buffer [to maintain the pH about 4.5 or below comprising citric acid and \nsodium citratef'7 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction needed. To the extent a construction is needed, plain and ordinary meaning. \nDefendant \n\"one buffer comprising citric acid\" \nCourt \n\"one or more buffers made of citrate ions\" \nAs an initial matter, it appears that the parties misunderstand one another's positions with \nrespect to this term. Plaintiff states that Alkem's construction limits \"a citrate buffer\" to one that \ncontains only citric acid. (See D.I. 72 at 42) Alkem clarified, however, that it is not arguing that \nonly citric acid is present in a \"citrate buffer;\" instead, \"a citrate buffer\" requires citric acid and \nmay also contain other components . (Id. at 43) For its part, Alkem suggests Plaintiffs view is \nthat in all claims \"a citrate buffer\" must always comprise citric acid and sodium citrate. (Id. at \n40) If this were true, there would be no need to clarify within claim 26 that the buffer comprises \nthese ingredients; this limitation would be \"'mere surplusage. \"' (Id. at 39) ( quoting Texas \nInstruments Inc. v. US Int'! Trade Comm 'n, 988 F.2d 1165, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1993)) Plaintiff, \nhowever, does not propose construing \"a citrate buffer\" as always comprising citric acid and \nsodium citrate. In Plaintiff's view, \"'a citrate buffer' alone would not be read by a POSA to \nmean a buffer of only citric acid, of only sodium citrate, or of only citric acid and sodium citrate \ntogether.\" (D.I. 72 at 42-43) (citing D.I. 73-1 at Appx 471-76) (Handbook of Pharmaceutical \nExcipients listing sodium citrate and potassium citrate as potential buffering agents) Instead, a \nPOSA would understand that \"a 'citrate buffer' indicates that the buffer is made of citrate ions, \n7 This term appears in claim 26 of the '868 patent. \n11 which may be added to the solution through a number of ways, including citric acid, sodium \ncitrate, and potassium citrate.\" (Id. at 42 n.17) \nIn any event, Defendant's proposed construction is not supported by the claim language . \nIt would, as Plaintiff explains, read out the sodium citrate expressly recited in claim 26. (See id. \nat 41; Tr. at 38-39) \nDefendant points to the '868 patent's prosecution , during which Dr. Mosher, one of the \npatent's inventors, stated that certain formulations created to test stability were prepared using a \n\"citrate-based buffer.\" (D.I. 72 at 38-39) (citing D.I. 51-1 at Appx 236-37) Three of these \nformulations, H7-H9, were prepared with citric acid only, suggesting that the patentee \nunderstood that a \"citrate-based buffer\" does not necessarily include sodium citrate. (D.I. 51-1 at \nAppx 236-37) Plaintiff concedes that, since these three formulations lack sodium citrate, they \nare outside the scope of claim 26. (Tr. at 42-43) In Plaintiffs view, however, this should not \nbear on the Court's construction , as Dr. Mosher did not explain that claim 26 covered all of his \nexamples; rather, claim 26 is a narrower claim. (See id.) Plaintiff also notes that Dr. Mosher \ndescribed these formulations as \"citrate-based buffers,\" referring to the citrate ion and not the \ncomponent excipients , and points to another formulation discussed by Dr. Mosher, Hl, which \ncontained both citric acid and sodium citrate. (D.I. 72 at 41-42) \nIn the Court's view, this prosecution history supports Azurity's articulation of a \"citrate \nbuffer\" as, more generally , made of citrate ions. In claim 26, it is clear that these citrate ions are \ncitric acid and sodium citrate, as in the Hl formulation . \nIn sum, since the parties dispute the scope of the claim term, the Court concludes that \nconstruction is necessary. See 02 Micro Int'! Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., 521 F.3d \n1351, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The Court adopts the term's plain and ordinary meaning consistent \n12 with the remainder of the claim. It also incorporates its prior construction of \"a buffer\" to mean \n\"one or more buffers.\" This construction is supported by the claim language, the prosecution \nhistory, and -to a lesser extent -the excerpts from the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients , \nwhich Alkem concedes explain that a citrate buffer may comprise citrate ions such as sodium \ncitrate and potassium citrate. (See D.I. 72 at 44) \nD. \"[a buffer comprising] a mixture of citric acid and sodium citrate[, wherein the \nbuffer is present at a concentration between about 5 mM and about 20 mM in the \noral liquidformulationf'8 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction needed. To the extent a construction is needed, plain and ordinary meaning. \nDefendant \n\"a combination of citric acid and sodium citrate distinct from the formulation's other \ncomponents\" \nCourt \nNo construction needed. \nThe plain language of claims 1, 13, and 14 of the '482 patent makes clear that citric acid \nand sodium citrate cannot meet the requirements of the claimed preservative in these claims. \nUnlike in earlier versions of the '482 patent and certain prior art references, which recited \"a \npreservative\" more broadly, these claims in their current form specify that the preservative is \n\"sodium benzoate\" (' 482 patent els. 1, 13) or \"a paraben or a mixture of parabens\" (id. cl. 14). \nCitric acid and sodium citrate are excluded from the list of potential preservatives , eliminating \nthe possibility that either component could serve \"double duty as both a buffer and a \npreservative .\" (D.I. 42 at 47) The Court agrees with Plaintiff that, consistent with this analysis, \nthe claim language is readily understandable to a POSA. (See Tr. at 43-44) Further, it is not \nclear how Alkem's \"artificial separation of the claimed citric acid and sodium citrate from the \n8 This term appears in claims 1, 13, and 14 of the '482 patent. \n13 other recited ingredients in the claimed liquid solution\" would be achieved. (See D.I. 72 at 47) \nThe Court sees no dispute here that would be resolved by adoption of any claim construction , \nincluding Defendant 's proposed construction. \nE. \"consisting essentially of'9 \nPlaintiff \nPlain and ordinary meaning. \nDefendant \n\"including , exclusivel y\" \nCourt \n\"including the listed ingredients and open to unlisted ingredients that do not materially affect \nthe basic and novel properties of the invention \" \nThe Court will construe \"consisting essentiall y of' in accordance with its well\u00ad\nestablished legal meaning, which is: \"includ[ing] the listed ingredients and ... open to unlisted \ningredients that do not materially affect the basic and novel properties of the invention. \" PPG, \n156 F.3d at 1354; see also Manual of Patent Examining Procedure\u00a7 2111.03. As discussed \nabove (in connection with the Court's construction of \"a buffer\"), Alkem has not shown that the \nnarrowing amendment -from \"comprising \" to \"consisting essentially of' -means that \n\"consisting essentially of' should be interpreted more narrowly than it is customarily understood. \nNor is the Court convinced by Alkem's citation to the common specification , which mentions \nthat claims reciting \"comprising \" are open-ended . (D.I. 72 at 49-50) (citing '868 patent at 29:35-\n42) Additionally, Alkem conceded at the hearing that a construction reflecting the well\u00ad\nestablished legal meaning of \"consisting essentiall y of' would be agreeable. (See Tr. at 51) \nIII.
