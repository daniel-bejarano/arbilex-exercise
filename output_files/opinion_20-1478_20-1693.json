Davis, S\nAUL EWING ARNSTEIN & LEHR LLP,  \nWilmington, Delaware.  \nCounsel for Defendant . \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \nDecember 3 , 2021 2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nParties must live with the choices they make, even if they later regret them. Here, \nthe University of Delaware asked me to decide a novel issue of Delaware law. I did. \nNow, having lost that battle, the University  asks me to let the Delaware Su preme \nCourt take a second  crack at it. Doing so would be unfair and wasteful. So I  deny its \nrequest . \nThe Covid -19 pandemic hit midway through the 2020 spring semester. Facing that \nunprecedented crisis, the University of Delaware moved its classes onlin e and shut-\ntered student buildings .  \nAngry about the closures, some students (and their parents) sued the University \nfor partial refunds under Delaware law in Delaware courts . The University faced a \nchoice: do battle in Delaware or in federal district court. It went federal. Then, it  \nmoved to dismiss the suits. I granted  those motions  in part  but ruled that the Uni-\nversity had plausibly , though impliedly,  promised in -person classes. I dec ided that \nthe students could sue over those implicit promises  even though they had contracted \nexpressly with the University about other matters .  \nIn an about -face, the University now claims I should never have  answered that \nlegal question . Instead, it says I should certify the issue to the Delaware Supreme \nCourt , so it can weigh in . See Del. Const. art. IV, \u00a7  11(8)  (allowing certification) . After \nall, argues the University, the issue is novel, important, and arises out of Delaware \nlaw.  3 The decision to certify \u201crests in the sound discretion of \u2026 federal court[s] ,\u201d so I \nneed not decide whether this case meets Delaware\u2019s certification standard.  Lehman \nBros. v. Schein , 416 U.S. 386, 391 (1974). Using  that discretion , I deny the Univer-\nsity\u2019s request.  \nFor starters, the University selected a federal forum. These cases began in Dela-\nware \u2019s courts . The University chose to remove them to the federal system. Russo v. \nUniv. of Del. , No. 20 -1693, D.I. 1 , at 1\u2013 2 (Dec. 14, 2020); Ninivaggi v. Univ. of Del. , \nNo. 20 -1478, D.I. 1 , at 1 \u20132 (Oct. 29, 2020). Now it should  live with that choice . Plus, \ncertifying now would give the University a do-over. It lost. It can not erase the score  \nbecause it did not like the stadium it  chose . \nBesides, the University could have moved to certify  before I ruled on its  motion s \nto dismiss. By then,  it knew that the case presented novel and important issues . In-\nstead, it let me resolve them. Certifying now would prolong litigation, waste court \ntime, and deplete judicial resources.  See Arizonans for Off . Eng. v. Arizona, 520 U.S. \n43, 77 (1997). So I choose not to certify.  \n* * * * * \nSometimes c ertification can help . It can reduce delay and  ensure that legal issues \nare decided by the most competent tribunals. But here, certification would ask a ques-\ntion I have already answered, cause  undue delay, and give one party a do- over. So I \ndeny the University\u2019s motion.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nPENNY NINIVAGGI et al. , individually and \non behalf of all others similarly situated,  \n \nPlaintiffs , \nv. \n \nUNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE, \n \nDefendant . \n  \n  \n \nNo. 20-cv-1478-SB \n \nHANNAH RUSSO,  individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated,  \n \nPlaintiff , \nv. \n \nUNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE, \n \nDefendant . \n No. 20 -cv-1693-SB \n \n  ORDER  \n1.
