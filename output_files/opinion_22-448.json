BACKGROUND Civ. A. No. 22-448-CFC \nIn November 2010, a Delaware Superior Court jury found Petitioner guilty of first \ndegree robbery, possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony \n(\"PDWDCF\"), two counts of aggravated menacing, and resisting arrest. See State v. \nWalker, 2013 WL 285737, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 24, 2013). The Superior Court \nsentenced Petitioner as a habitual offender on January 21, 2011 to life imprisonment, \nplus ten years. See State v. Walker, 2015 WL 3654806, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. June 8, \n2015). Petitioner filed a motion for reduction of sentence on January 28, 2011, which \nthe Superior Court denied on February 17, 2011. See Walker v. Metzger, 2019 WL \n4013976, at *1 (D. Del. Aug. 26, 2019). The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed \nPetitioner's convictions and sentences on September 6, 2011. See Walker v. State, 27 \nA.3d 552 (Table), 2011 WL 3904991, at *3 (Del. Sept. 6, 2011 ). \nIn January 2012, Petitioner filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to \nDelaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\"), which the Superior Court denied on April 8, 2013. See Walker, 2019 WL 4013976, at *1. On post-conviction \nappeal, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed the Superior Court's decision and \nremanded Petitioner's case to the Superior Court with instructions to appoint counsel for \nPetitioner. See Walker v. State, 69 A.3d 372 (Table) 2013 WL 3355899, at *1 (Del. \nJune 28, 2103). \nOn November 17, 2014, with the assistance of counsel, Petitioner filed an \namended Rule 61 motion. See Walker, 2019 WL 4013976, at *1. The Superior Court \ndenied the amended Rule 61 motion on June 8, 2015, and the Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed that decision on May 2, 2016. See State v. Walker, 2015 WL 3654806, \nat *4-5 (Del. Super. Ct. June 8, 2015); Walker v. State, 138 A.3d 476 (Table), 2016 WL \n2654347 (Del. May 2, 2016). In 2016, Petitioner filed two motions for modification of \nsentence, which the Superior Court denied. See State v. Walker, 2021 WL 3700939, at \n*1 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 20, 2021 ). \nThereafter, Petitioner filed in this Court a prose petition for writ of habeas corpus \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 challenging his 2010 conviction. (See D.I. 3 in Walker v. \nPierce, Civ. A. No. 16-678-CFC) The petition asserted the following three ineffective \nassistance of counsel claims: (1) defense counsel improperly permitted Petitioner to \nappear before the jury in prison clothing during the trial; (2) defense counsel failed to \nrequest a proper first degree robbery jury instruction that conformed with Delaware law; \nand (3) defense counsel failed to appeal the denial of Petitioner's motion for judgment of \nacquittal. (See id.) In 2019, the Court denied the petition after determining that the \nclaims lacked merit. See Walker, 2019 WL 4013976, at *2-7. Petitioner appealed, and \n2 the Third Circuit declined to issue a certificate of appealability, explaining that \n\"[r]easonable jurists would not debate that the District Court properly dismissed \n[Petitioner's] petition.\" (D.I. 26 in Walker, Civ. A. No. 16-678-CFC) \nIn September 2019, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court a fourth motion for \nmodification of sentence. See Walker, 2021 WL 3700939, at *1. The Superior Court \ndenied the motion, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision. See id. In \nAugust 2021, Petitioner jointly filed a Rule 61 motion and a Rule 35(a) motion for \ncorrection of sentence. See Walker v. State, 2022 WL 244754, at *2 (Del. Jan. 26, \n2022). The Superior Court denied both motions, and the Delaware Supreme Court \naffirmed that decision in January 2022. See Walker, 2021 WL 3700939, at *1; Walker, \n2022 WL 244754, at *3. \nOn April 4, 2022, Petitioner filed in this Court another petition for writ of habeas \ncorpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (11Petition\"). (D.I. 1) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA district court may summarily dismiss a petition for a writ of habeas corpus \nwithout ordering a responsive pleading \"if it plainly appears from the face of the petition \nand any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 \nU.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254; see also Mayle v. Felix, 545 U.S. 644, 656 (2005). Federal habeas \nrelief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is only available to a petitioner who demonstrates that his \ncustody under a state court judgment violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the \nUnited States. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); see also Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-\n68 (1991). \n3 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), a petitioner must seek authorization from \nthe appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive habeas petition in \na district court. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U.S. 147, 152 (2007); Rule 9, 28 U.S.C. foll. \n\u00a72254. A habeas petition is classified as second or successive within the meaning of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 if a prior petition has been decided on the merits, the prior and new \npetitions challenge the same conviction, and the new petition asserts a claim that was, \nor could have been, raised in a prior habeas petition. See Benchoffv. Colleran, 404 \nF.3d 812, 817 (3d Cir. 2005); In re O/abode, 325 F.3d 166, 169-73 (3d Cir. 2003). If a \nhabeas petitioner erroneously files a second or successive habeas petition \"in a district \ncourt without the permission of a court of appeals, the district court's only option is to \ndismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.\" \nRobinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir. 2002). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nThe sole claim in the instant Petition asserts that defense counsel provided \nineffective assistance counsel during Petitioner's trial, appeal, and habitual offender \nhearing. (D.I. 1 at 5) Petitioner asks the Court to grant the jointly filed Rule 61/35 \nmotions he filed in the Delaware state courts and vacate his life without parole \nsentence. (D .I. 1 at 15) \nTo the extent the instant Petition challenges the Delaware Supreme Court's 2022 \ndecision affirming the Superior Court's denial of Petitioner's jointly filed Rule 61/Rule 35 \nmotions, the Petition fails to assert an issue cognizable on federal habeas review. See \nHassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F .3d 941, 954 (3d Cir.1998) (holding that the \"federal role \n4 in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what occurred in \nthe state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner's conviction; what \noccurred in the petitioner's collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas \nproceeding.\") (emphasis in original); see also Lambert v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d 210, 247 \n(3d Cir. 2004) (\"alleged errors in [state] collateral proceedings ... are not a proper basis \nfor habeas relief'). Therefore, the Court will dismiss the Petition for lack of jurisdiction \nbecause Petitioner has failed to present a proper basis for federal habeas relief. \nAdditionally, to the extent the Petition's ineffective assistance of counsel \nargument challenges the validity of Petitioner's 2010 conviction and 2011 sentence, the \nPetition constitutes a second or successive habeas petition within the meaning of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244. The Petition challenges the same 2010 conviction that Petitioner \nchallenged in his first federal habeas proceeding, the earlier petition was denied as \nmeritless, and Petitioner could have presented his current ineffective assistance of \ncounsel allegation in his earlier petition. \nPetitioner does not assert, and nothing in the record indicates, that the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals authorized the filing of the instant second or successive habeas \nPetition. Further, the Court finds that it is not in the interest of justice to transfer this \ncase to the Third Circuit, because the Petition does not come close to satisfying the \nsubstantive requirements for a second or successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2244(b )(2). Given these circumstances, the Court will alternatively dismiss the Petition \nfor lack of jurisdiction because it constitutes an unauthorized second or successive \npetition. \n5 IV. CONCLUSION \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the instant Petition either \nasserts an issue that is not cognizable on federal habeas review or constitutes an \nunauthorized second or successive request for habeas relief. Therefore, the Court will \nsummarily dismiss the Petition for lack of jurisdiction. The Court will also decline to \nissue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner has failed to make a \"substantial \nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. \nL.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate \nOrder will be entered. \nDated: April 25, 2022 \n6 {jt__@t!...4-\nColm F. Connolly \nChief Judge "}
