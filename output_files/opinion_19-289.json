Prose Petitioner. Civil Action No. 19-289-CFC \nAndrew J. Vella, Deputy Attorney General of the Delaware Department of Justice, \nWilmington, Delaware. Attorney for Respondents. \nJanuary 31, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION \n1Warden Robert May has replaced former Warden Dana Metzger, an original party to \nthe case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). Pending before the Court is Petitioner Efrain Riveria's Petition for a Writ of \nHabeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. (D.I. 1) The State filed an Answer in \nopposition. (D.I. 13) For the reasons discussed , the Court will deny the Petition as \nbarred by the limitations period prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn August 2009, the 23 year-old victim and her 3 month-old \nson were living with her uncle and his family in the City of \nWilmington . On August 14, 2009, several friends of the \nvictim's uncle, including [Petitioner), were at his house. \n[Petitioner] had been drinking beer and appeared intoxicated . \n[Petitioner] left the house around 11 :00 p.m., but returned a \nfew minutes later and asked to spend the night. The victim's \nuncle refused to allow [Petitioner] to stay, escorting \n[Petitioner] to the door and locking the door behind him. \nIn the early morning hours of August 15, 2009, the victim, who \nwas sleeping in her bed with her baby beside her, was \nawakened by [Petitioner] , who was standing over her with a \nknife in his hand. [Petitioner], wearing only a shirt and socks, \ntold the victim, in crude fashion, that he wanted to have sex \nwith her. [Petitioner) told the victim that, if she screamed, he \nwould harm her and the baby. He slapped her face and put \nhis hand over her mouth. [Petitioner) attempted to have sex \nwith the victim, but failed to fully penetrate her. Ultimately , he \nejaculated on the victim's vagina. [Petitioner) then left the \nroom. The victim screamed that she had been raped. She \nawakened her uncle, who called 911. The victim's uncle \nobserved that the kitchen window was open and that \n[Petitioner]'s pants and shoes were on the floor. The police \ncollected the items as evidence. The victim underwent a \nsexual assault examination that morning. Photographs taken \nat that time showed bruising to her face. The victim later \nidentified [Petitioner] from a photographic array. DNA testing \nof the victim's pajamas and swabs from [Petitioner] and the \nvictim linked [Petitioner] to the crime. \n2 Rivera v. State, 26 A.3d 214 (Table), 2011 WL 3074930 (Del. July 25, 2011).2 \nOn May 18, 2010, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of first \ndegree rape, second degree rape (as a lesser-included offense of first degree rape), \nmenacing, third degree assault, endangering the welfare of a child, and two counts of \nterroristic threatening. (D.I. 13 at 2); see State v. Rivera, 2015 WL 4126946, at *1 (Del. \nSuper. Ct. July 9, 2015). The Superior Court sentenced him to eighteen years at Level \nV, suspended after fifteen years for three years at Level IV, suspended after six months \nfor two years at Level Ill. See Rivera, 2015 WL 4126945, at *1. The Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed Petitioner's convictions and sentence on July 25, 2011. See \nRivera, 2011 WL 307 4930, at *3. \nOn October 22, 2012, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a motion for \nthe appointment of counsel to pursue postconviction relief. (D.I. 14-6 at 43) The \nSuperior Court appointed counsel on December 11, 2012 (\"post-conviction counsel\"). \nOn October 22, 2012, post-conviction counsel filed a motion for postconviction relief \npursuant to Delaware Superior Court Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\"). The Superior Court \ndenied the Rule 61 motion on July 9, 2015, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed \nthat decision on March 21, 2016. See Rivera, 2015 WL 4126946, at *8; Rivera v. State, \n135A.3d 306 (Table), 2016 WL 1165857 (Del. Mar. 21, 2016). Petitioner filed a motion \n2The Court notes that Petitioner's name in the Delaware court decisions (\"Rivera\") \ndiffers from Petitioner's name in this proceeding (\"Riveria\"). The instant case is \ncaptioned consistently with the name Petitioner included on his form habeas application: \nEfrain Riveria. (D.I. 1 at 1) In contrast, the Delaware courts and, therefore, their \ndecisions, refer to Petitioner as Efrain Rivera. (See, e.g., D.I. 14-1 at 1) \n3 for modification of sentence on January 28, 2019, which the Superior Court denied on \nMarch 28, 2019. (D.I. 14-1 at Entry Nos. 78, 79) \nIn February 2019, Petitioner filed the instant Petition asserting the following four \ngrounds for relief: (1) the trial judge denied him access to cell tower records and \nimproperly admitted \"tainted and mishandled\" DNA evidence (D.I. 3 at 19); (2) he did \nnot rape the victim, because any sexual contact was consensual and part of an ongoing \naffair between him and the victim (D.I. 3 at 14); (3) defense counsel provided ineffective \nassistance by failing to make challenges and necessary objections (D.I. 1 at 7); and (4) \nthe State prosecuted him because it \"needed a scape goat\" and \"thought a Hispanic \nwould justtake it.\"3 (D.I. 1 at 8) \nII. ONE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS \nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(''AEDPA\") \"to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences .. \n. and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\" Woodford v. Garceau, \n538 U.S. 202, 206 (20.03). AEDPA prescribes a one-year period of limitations for the \nfiling of habeas petitions by state prisoners that begins to run from the latest of: \n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the \nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for \nseeking such review; \n(8) the date on which the impediment to filing an application \ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws \nof the United States is removed, if the applicant was \nprevented from filing by such State action; \n3Petitioner also asks to be \"compensated for [his] unlawful incarceration\" in the amount \nof $500,000. (D.I. 1 at 15; D.I. 1-2 at 1) Such relief is not available on federal habeas \nreview. See Muhammed v. Close, 540 U.S. 749, 750 (2004). \n4 (C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was \ninitially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been \nnewly recognized by the Supreme Court and made \nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or \n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or \nclaims presented could have been discovered through the \nexercise of due diligence. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1 ). AEDPA's limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable \ntolling. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2244( d)(2) ( statutory tolling). \nPetitioner does not assert, and the Court does not discern, any facts triggering \nthe application of\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B),(C), or (D). Consequently, the one-year period of \nlimitations began to run when Petitioner's convictions became final under \u00a7 \n2244(d)(1 )(A). \nPursuant to\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court judgment \nbut does not seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes final, and the \nstatute of limitations begins to run, upon expiration of the ninety-day time period allowed \nfor seeking certiorari review. See Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d 565, 575, 578 (3d \nCir. 1999); Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 158 (3d Cir. 1999). In this case, the \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's conviction on July 25, 2011, and he did \nnot seek review by the United States Supreme Court. As a result, his judgment of \nconviction became final on October 24, 2011. Applying the one-year limitations period \nto that date, Petitioner had until October 24, 2012 to timely file a habeas petition. See \nWilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64 (3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to \n5 AEDPA's limitations period); Phlipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. \nApr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA's one-year limitations period is calculated according to the \nanniversary method, i.e., the limitations period expires on the anniversary of the date it \nbegan to run). Petitioner, however, did not file the instant Petition until February 11, \n2019,4 more than six years after that deadline. Thus, the Petition is time-barred and \nshould be dismissed, unless the limitations period can be statutorily or equitably tolled, \nor Petitioner makes a gateway showing of actual innocence. See Jones, 195 F.3d at \n158; see Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F.4th 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021) (explaining that actual \ninnocence is an \"exception to the statute of limitations\" rather than an \"extension to the \nstatute of limitations via equitable tolling.\") The Court will discuss each doctrine in turn. \nA. Statutory Tolling \nPursuant to\u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls \nAEDPA's limitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, \nincluding any post-conviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending \nbefore the expiration of AEDPA's limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d \n417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). A post-conviction motion is 111properly filed' for statutory \ntolling purposes when its delivery and acceptance is in compliance with the state's \napplicable laws and rules governing filings, such as the form of the document, any time \n4Pursuant to the prison mailbox rule, the Court adopts as the filing date the date on \nwhich Petitioner provided the Petition to prison authorities to be electronically filed: \nFebruary 11, 2019. See Longenette v. Krusing, 322 F.3d 758, 761 (3d Cir. 2003) (the \ndate on which a prisoner transmitted documents to prison authorities for mailing is to be \nconsidered the actual filing date). \n6 limits upon its delivery, the location of the filing, and the requisite filing fee.\" Crump v. \nPhelps, 572 F. Sup. 2d 480, 483 (D. Del. 2008). The limitations period is also tolled for \nthe time during which an appeal from a post-conviction decision could be filed even if \nthe appeal is not eventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424. The limitations period, \nhowever, is not tolled during the ninety days a petitioner has to file a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state \npost-conviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist. Att'y of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d \nCir. 2001). \nPetitioner's Rule 61 motion, filed on September 2, 2014, has no statutory tolling \neffect because it was filed after the expiration of the limitations period. Thus, the \nPetition is time-barred, unless equitable tolling applies. \n8. Equitable Tolling \nThe one-year limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in rare \ncircumstances when the petitioner demonstrates \"(1) that he has been pursuing his \nrights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and \nprevented timely filing.\" Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence \ninquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to the petitioner's \nexcusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. Additionally, the obligation to act diligently \"does not \npertain solely to the filing of the federal habeas petition, rather it is an obligation that \nexists during the period [the petitioner] is exhausting state court remedies as well.\" \nLacava v. Kyler, 398 F.3d 271, 277 (3d Cir. 2005). As for the extraordinary \ncircumstance requirement, \"the relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged \n7 to be extraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an obstacle it creates with \nrespect to meeting AEDPA's one-year deadline.\" Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d 385, \n401 (3d Cir. 2011 ). An extraordinary circumstance will warrant equitable tolling only 1 if \nthere is \"a causal connection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and \nthe petitioner's failure to file a timely federal petition.\" Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, \n803 (3d. Cir. 2013). \nPetitioner does not assert that any extraordinary circumstance prevented him \nfrom complying with AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. Nevertheless, the Court \ndiscerns a particular situation that occurred during Petitioner's Rule 61 proceeding that \nmay be viewed as an extraordinary circumstance. On October 22, 2012, Petitioner filed \na motion in the Superior Court seeking the appointment of counsel to pursue Rule 61 \nrelief. The Superior Court appointed counsel in December 2012, but counsel did not file \na Rule 61 motion until September 2, 2014. The issue is whether the time from October \n22, 2012 through September 2, 2014 should be equitably tolled. Since the result is the \nsame, the Court summarily presumes that the motion to appoint counsel should be \nviewed as triggering equitable tolling. In this scenario, when Petitioner filed his motion \nto appoint counsel on October 22, 2012, 363 days of the one-year limitations period had \nalready expired. The limitations period remained tolled through March 21, 2016, the \ndate on which the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's denial of \nPetitioner's Rule 61 motion. Since there were only two days left in the one-year filing \ndeadline, Petitioner's filing in 2019 was clearly too late. Therefore, even with any \npossible equitable tolling, the Petition is time-barred. \n8 C. Actual Innocence \nFinally, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \"equitable \nexception\" that can overcome the bar of AEDPA's one-year limitations period. See \nMcQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S 383,392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F. 4th at 150-151. A \npetitioner satisfies the actual innocence exception by (1) presenting new, reliable \nevidence of his innocence, and (2) showing \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that \n\"a reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt about his guilt[] in light of the new \nevidence.\" Wallace, 2 F.4th at 151. \nPetitioner contends he is actually innocent because he and the victim were \nromantically involved, and her \"cries of rape\" were an attempt to hide her infidelity. (D.I. \n3 at 7) The Superior Court rejected the same argument in Petitioner's Rule 61 motion \nbecause Petitioner's description of the relationship as a consensual romance was \ninconsistent with the evidence. See Rivera, 2015 WL 4126946, at *1-2. In this \nproceeding, Petitioner has not provided any new reliable evidence of his actual \ninnocence, nor has he provided anything to rebut or even cast doubt on the Superior \nCourt's findings. Thus, Petitioner's conclusory and unsupported assertion of innocence \nbased on a consensual affair does satisfy the actual innocence standard. \nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the instant Petitioner as time-barred. 5 \nIll. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \n5Having determined that the Petition is time-barred, the Court will not address the \nState's alternate reasons for dismissing the Petition. \n9 The Court must decide whether to issue a certificate of appealabilty. See 3d Cir. \nL.A.R. 22.2 (2011 ). A certificate of appealability may be issued only when a petitioner \nmakes a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2253(c)(2). This showing is satisfied when the petitioner demonstrates \"that reasonable \njurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or \nwrong.\" Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Petitioner's habeas \nPetition must be dismissed as time-barred. Reasonable jurists would not find the \nCourt's assessment of Petitioner's constitutional claims to be debatable or wrong. \nConsequently, Petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a \nconstitutional right, and a certificate of appealability will not be issued. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss the instant Petition as time\u00ad\nbarred. An appropriate Order will be entered. \n10 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nEFRAIN RIVERIA, \nPetitioner , \nV. \nROBERT MAY, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE , \nRespondents.
