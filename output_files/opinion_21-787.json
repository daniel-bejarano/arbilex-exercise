MacLean, GREENBERG\nTRAURIG, New York, NY.\n\nAttorneys for Defendants.\n\nFebruary (2. 2022\n\nANDREWS, & STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nBefore me are two motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (D.I. 50, 53). The motions have\nbeen fully briefed and I have considered the parties\u2019 briefing. (D.I. 51, 54, 56, 57, 58).\n\nIL BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs Dakotah Massie and Neil Manglani bring this class action suit against Defendants\nGM and Decibel. They allege four Counts, all based on GM\u2019s use of Decibel\u2019s \u201cSession Replay\u201d\nsoftware on GM\u2019s websites. Counts I and II claim violations of Sections 631 and 635 of the\nCalifornia Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) by both Defendants; Count IV claims a violation of\nSection 2512 of the Federal Wiretap Act by Decibel; and Count III claims an invasion of privacy\nunder California\u2019s Constitution. Plaintiffs withdrew Count III in the briefing. (D.I. 56 at 25 n.13).\n\nPlaintiffs seek to represent a class of \u201call residents in the United States who visited\n[websites owned and operated by GM (\u201cthe Website\u201d)], and whose electronic communications\nwere intercepted or recorded by Decibel\u201d and a subclass of \u201call California residents who visited\nthe Website, and whose electronic communications were intercepted or recorded by QM (sic)!.\u201d\n(D.1. 25 \u00a7 50, 51). Both classes are asserted in Count IV; only the California class is asserted in\nCounts I and II. One of the consequences of the oddities of personal jurisdiction is that this case,\nwhich was originally filed in California, was transferred to Delaware. (D.I. 38). There is no basis\nfor the federal claim,\u201d so this case in Delaware boils down to two Californians seeking to represent\na class limited to Californians asserting only violations of California law.\n\n1 I think QM is a cut-and-paste remnant from a separate lawsuit against Quantum Metrics. I\n\nthink Plaintiffs mean Decibel, not QM.\n\n2 The California District Courts may disagree about the merits of some of the California\nclaims, but they appear to agree that no federal wiretapping claim is stated. See Yoon v. Lululemon\n\n2\nSection 631 of the CIPA applies to:\n\nany person who, by means of any machine, instrument, or contrivance, or in any\nother manner, intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection... with any\n... communication system, or who willfully and without the consent of the parties\nto the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read,\nor to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while\nthe same is in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or is being sent from,\nor received at any place within this state.\n\nSection 635 of the CIPA applies to:\n\nEvery person who manufactures, assembles, sells, offers for sale, advertises for\nsale, possesses, transports, imports, or furnishes to another any device which is\nprimarily or exclusively designed or intended for eavesdropping upon the\ncommunication of another, or any device which is primarily or exclusively\ndesigned or intended for the unauthorized interception or reception of\ncommunications between cellular radio telephones...\n\nSection 2512 of the Federal Wiretap Act applies to any person who intentionally:\n\nmanufactures, assembles, possesses, or sells any electronic, mechanical, or other\ndevice, knowing or having reason to know that the design of such device renders it\nprimarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or\nelectronic communications, and that such device or any component thereof has\nbeen or will be sent through the mail or transported in interstate or foreign\ncommerce.\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2512(1)(b).\n\nDecibel\u2019s Session Replay software records website users\u2019 mouse movements, clicks, and i\nkeystrokes, producing \u201cvideo-accurate renders of real visits\u201d to websites. (D.I. 25 [J 23, 26). The\nsoftware also captures the date, time, and duration of a user\u2019s visit, as well as the user\u2019s IP address,\n\"location at the time of the visit[],\u201d browser type, and device\u2019s operating system. (/d. 41). GM\n\nuses Decibel\u2019s Session Replay software on its websites. Ud. \u00a7 35).\n\nUSA, Inc., 2021 WL 3615907, at *7-8 (C.D. Cal. July 15, 2021) (\u00a72512); Mastel v. Miniclip SA,\n2021 WL 2983198, at *10-11 (E.D. Cal. July 15, 2021) (\u00a72701).\n\n3\nMassie and Manglani visited one of GM\u2019s websites, Chevrolet.com, in August and\nSeptember of 2020 on a combined three occasions. (Jd, {J 39, 40). On those visits, Massie and\nManglani \u201cbrowsed the vehicle sections\u201d but did not purchase anything and, therefore, did not\ninput any of their personal information (e.g., name, zip code, phone number, email address). (Jd.\n\n49 39, 40, 43, 44).\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\nBecause Article [II standing is a prerequisite for a federal court\u2019s subject matter\njurisdiction, a motion to dismiss for lack of standing is properly brought under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(1). Ballentine v. United States, 486 F.3d 806, 810 (3d Cir. 2007). To establish standing under\nArticle IIL, a plaintiff must have \u201c(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the\nchallenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial\ndecision.\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016). \u201cThe plaintiff, as the party invoking\nfederal jurisdiction, bears the burden of establishing these elements.\u201d Jd. \u201cTo establish an injury in\nfact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is\nconcrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Jd. at 339.\n\u201cThat a suit may be a class action adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named\nplaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not\nthat injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong.\u201d\n\nId. at 338 n.6 (cleaned up).\n\u201cArticle III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.\u201d\n\nTransUnion LLC y. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2205 (2021). The \u201cCourt has rejected the\n\n3 There is only one precedential Third Circuit opinion to date that cites TransUnion, and that\nopinion does not add any gloss that is helpful on the issue here.\n\n4\n\nproposition that a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute\ngrants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.\u201d\nId. (cleaned up). \u201c[A]n injury in law is not an injury in fact. Only those plaintiffs who have been\nconcretely harmed by a defendant\u2019s statutory violation may sue that private defendant over that\nviolation in federal court.\u201d Id. While \u201ctraditional tangible harms, such as physical harms and\nmonetary harms\u201d are \u201cobvious[ly]\u201d concrete, \u201c[vJarious intangible harms can also be concrete.\u201d\nId. at 2204. \u201cChief among them are injuries with a close relationship to harms traditionally\nrecognized as providing a basis for lawsuits in American courts. Those include, for example,\nreputational harms, disclosure of private information, and intrusion upon seclusion.\u201d Jd. (cleaned\nup).\n\nIn TransUnion, where the plaintiffs sought to sue a credit reporting agency for preparing\ncredit reports containing inaccurate information about the plaintiffs, the Court analogized the\nplaintiffs\u2019 injury to the common law tort of defamation. TransUnion, 141 S, Ct. at 2208. The Court\nfound that the plaintiffs whose inaccurate credit reports had not been provided to any potential\ncreditors had not suffered a concrete injury, because a critical element of defamation \u2014\ndissemination \u2014 was lacking. Id. at 2209-10 (\u201cThe mere presence of an inaccuracy in an internal\ncredit file, if it is not disclosed to a third party, causes no concrete harm.\u201d). The Court also found\nthat the risk of future harm to the plaintiffs by the potential disclosure of their incorrect credit\nreports in the future was insufficient to qualify as a concrete harm. /d. at 2210-12 (\u201c[P]laintiffs\u2019\nargument for standing for their damages claims based on an asserted risk of future harm is\nunavailing.\u201d).\n\nHere, Plaintiffs analogize their injury to an invasion of privacy or a harm to their \u201cinterest\n\nin controlling their personal information.\u201d (D.I. 56 at 7-8). \u201c[B]Joth the common law and the literal\n\nunderstandings of privacy encompass the individual\u2019s control of information concerning his or her\nperson.\u201d U.S. Dept. of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 763-64\n(1989). Plaintiffs cite a slew of cases in which courts have recognized invasion of privacy as an\ninjury sufficient to confer standing. (D.I. 56 at 7-8). I find, however, that the critical facts of the\ncases Plaintiffs cite concerning an invasion of privacy injury are distinguishable from the facts at\nissue here. Each of Plaintiffs\u2019 cited cases involves the collection and disclosure of personal\ninformation. Here, Plaintiffs do not allege that any of their information collected by the Session\nReplay software was personal or private within the common law understanding of a privacy right.\nTherefore, I find Plaintiffs have not suffered a concrete injury because they do not have a privacy\ninterest at stake.\n\nI now review the cases upon which Plaintiffs rely and explain why they do not help\nPlaintiffs.\n\nIn In re Facebook, Facebook used \u201cplug-ins to track users\u2019 browsing histories when they\nvisit[ed] third-party websites, and then compile[d] these browsing histories into personal profiles\nwhich [were] sold to advertisers to generate revenue.\u201d Jn re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking\nLitig., 956 F.3d 589, 596 (9\" Cir. 2020). Facebook continued to track users\u2019 browsing even after\nthey had logged out of Facebook. Jd. The Court found that this behavior amounted to a concrete\nand particularized injury, as it caused \u201charm or a material risk of harm to [plaintiffs\u2019] interest in\ncontrolling their personal information.\u201d Jd. at 599. In reaching this conclusion, the Court\nemphasized the comprehensive nature of the tracking, and how it allowed Facebook to piece\ntogether a \u201c\u2018cradle-to-grave profile without users\u2019 consent\u201d by \u201ccorrelating users\u2019 browsing history\nwith users\u2019 personal Facebook profiles.\u201d Jd. at 598-99 (\u201c[T]his tracking occurred \u2018no matter how\n\nsensitive\u2019 or personal users\u2019 browsing histories were\u201d). The degree of the invasion of privacy at\n\nissue in In re Facebook is hardly comparable to the \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d Plaintiffs allege here.\nGM only recorded Plaintiffs\u2019 browsing while Plaintiffs were on GM\u2019s own website, GM obtained\nno personal information from Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs make no allegations that GM attempted to\nsell or monetize the information it collected in any way\n\nIn In re Nickelodeon, the plaintiffs alleged that Viacom tracked children\u2019s \u201cweb browsing\nand video-watching habits on Viacom\u2019s websites\u201d and then used that browsing information, in\naddition to user account information including the child\u2019s username/alias, gender, and birthdate,\n\u201cto sell targeted advertising based on users\u2019 web browsing.\u201d Jn re Nickelodeon Consumer Privacy\nLitig., 827 F.3d 262, 269 (3d Cir. 2016). The Court specifically pinpointed \u201cthe unlawful\ndisclosure of legally protected information\u201d as the concrete harm giving rise to Article III standing.\nId. at 274. Here, Plaintiffs have not provided a basis for the conclusion that the information GM\ncollected was \u201clegally protected,\u201d nor have they alleged any \u201cunlawful disclosure\u201d of such\ninformation.\n\nIn In re Google, the Court found the plaintiffs had been injured based \u201con highly specific\nallegations that the defendants, in the course of serving advertisements to their personal web\nbrowsers, implanted tracking cookies on their personal computers.\u201d Jn re Google Inc. Cookie\nPlacement Consumer Privacy Litigation, 806 F.3d 125, 134 (3d Cir. 2015). Unlike here, where\nPlaintiffs\u2019 browsing activities were only recorded while Plaintiffs were visiting GM\u2019s website, in\nIn re Google, the defendants circumvented users\u2019 \u201ccookie blockers\u201d settings to \u201ccompile the\ninternet histories of users,\u201d \u201ccreate detailed profiles on individuals,\u201d and then serve targeted ads to\nusers based on that activity. Jd, at 131. Such conduct is far more invasive than the conduct alleged\n\nhere.\n\nIn Eichenberger, the Court found that the plaintiff sustained a concrete injury when\n\u201cDefendant knowingly disclosed to a third party, AdobeAnalytics: (1) Plaintiff's Roku device\nserial number and (2) the identity of the video that he watched.\u201d Eichenberger v. ESPN, Inc., 876\nF.3d 979, 981 (9\" Cir. 2017). Adobe then used that information \u201cto identify specific consumers by\nconnecting that information \u2018with existing data already in Adobe\u2019s profile of those individuals\u2019\u201d\nsuch as \u201c\u2018email addresses, account information, or Facebook profile information, including photos\nand usernames.\u2019\u201d Id. Adobe then gave the resulting data back to the defendant, who in turn\n\u201cprovide[d] advertisers with aggregated information about its users\u2019 demographics.\u201d Jd. The Court\npredicated its finding that plaintiff had suffered a concrete injury on its conclusion that a person\u2019s\n\u201csubstantive right to privacy [] suffers any time a video service provider discloses otherwise private\ninformation.\u201d Jd. at 983-84. Here, Plaintiffs have not alleged any disclosure of any of their private\ninformation. Insofar as Plaintiffs have alleged GM disclosed their non-private information to\nDecibel,\u2018 they have not alleged that Decibel used that information in any way, let alone in a way\nthat harmed or would likely harm Plaintiffs.\n\nIn Moosejaw, the Court found the plaintiff had suffered a concrete injury where the\n\ndefendant \u201chelped [a third party] eavesdrop on [plaintiff's] communications and scan [plaintiff's]\n\n4 The only statements Plaintiffs make in their First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) that allege\nDecibel received any of the information GM collected are found in the \u201cThe Parties\u201d section of\nthe FAC. There, Plaintiffs state, Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ckeystrokes, mouse clicks, and other electronic\ncommunications were intercepted in real time and were disclosed to Defendants GM and Decibel\nthrough the wiretap,\u201d and each Plaintiff was \u201cunaware at the time that his keystrokes, mouse clicks\nand other electronic communications were being intercepted in real-time and would be disclosed\nto Decibel, nor did [each Plaintiff] consent to the same.\u201d (D.I. 25 Ff 4-5).\n\nPlaintiffs do not, however, make any specific allegations in the FAC\u2019s \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d\nsection to support these conclusory allegations, The allegations in the Statement of Facts section\nsuggest GM merely used Decibel\u2019s software. They do not specifically allege that Decibel received\nany of the information collected by GM, in real time or otherwise.\n\n8\n\ncomputer for files revealing his identity.\u201d Revitch v. New Moosejaw, LLC, 2019 WL 5485330, at\n*1 (NLD. Cal. Oct. 23, 2019). The Court reasoned, \u201cBeing eavesdropped upon is a concrete (though\nintangible) harm, as is having one\u2019s computer files surreptitiously scanned.\u201d Jd.\n\nMoosejaw does not help Plaintiffs. As explained in note 4, supra, 1 am unconvinced that\nPlaintiffs here have specifically alleged activity by Decibel that amounts to eavesdropping.\nNevertheless, even if Plaintiffs have alleged that anonymous information about their browsing\nactivities on GM\u2019s website was shared with Decibel, I do not think it follows that the reasoning of\nMoosejaw about being \u201ceavesdropped\u201d applies. Whether there is a concrete harm depends on the\nnature of the allegations; to say otherwise would be at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s clarification\nof standing doctrine in TransUnion. A legislature\u2019s \u201ccreation of a statutory prohibition or\nobligation and a cause of action does not relieve courts of their responsibility to independently\ndecide whether a plaintiff has suffered a concrete harm under Article III.\u201d TransUnion LLC vy.\nRamirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2205 (2021). \u201cOnly those plaintiffs who have been concretely harmed\nby a defendant\u2019s statutory violation may sue that private defendant over that violation in federal\ncourt.\u201d Id.\n\nJust as a claim for defamation requires disclosure of defamatory information, a claim of\ninvasion of privacy requires an intrusion upon something over which a person has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. \u201cEavesdropping\u201d on communications that do not involve personal\ninformation, personally identifiable information, or information over which a party has a\nreasonable expectation of privacy does not amount to a concrete injury. Plaintiffs do not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy over the anonymized data captured by the Session Replay\n\nsoftware at issue here.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the injury they have suffered is rooted in their \u201cinterest in controlling\ntheir personal information.\u201d (D.I. 56 at 8). I agree that Plaintiffs have a legally cognizable interest\nin controlling their personal information and that intrusion upon that interest would amount to a\nconcrete injury. The fact of the matter remains, however, that none of Plaintiffs\u2019 personal\ninformation is implicated by the allegations they make. Plaintiffs fail to explain how either GM\u2019s\nor Decibel\u2019s possession of anonymized, non-personal data regarding their browsing activities on\nGM\u2019s website harms their privacy interests in any way.\n\nFinally, in Mastel, the only post-TransUnion case cited by Plaintiffs on the issue of\nstanding, the District Court found \u201callegations that a company has violated a plaintiffs right to\nprivacy ... by collecting personal information without the plaintiffs consent involve a sufficiently\n\u2018concrete\u2019 injury, even if there are no additional allegations of publication, because the invasion\nitself causes harm to the plaintiffs interest in controlling the information.\u201d Mastel v. Miniclip SA,\n2021 WL 2983198, at *6 (E.D. Cal. July 15, 2021). The facts in Mastel, however, are readily\ndistinguishable from those at issue here. Maste/ involved a mobile application that was able to\n\u201cview, copy, and save\u201d whatever text the user had most recently \u201ccopied\u201d on his mobile device\nany time the application was open. Jd. at *1. The plaintiff alleged that some of the information the\napplication had access to included \u201chis name, email, phone number, and address, addresses of\nfriends and relatives, and personal and private messages that have been sent to friends and\nrelatives,\u201d Jd. Here, Plaintiffs do not allege any collection of personal information of that nature.\n\n\u201cA material risk of future harm can satisfy the concrete-harm requirement\u201d where a\nplaintiff \u201cexposed to a risk of future harm\u201d seeks \u201cforward-looking, injunctive relief to prevent the\n\nharm from occurring,\u201d but the risk of harm must be \u201csufficiently imminent and substantial.\u201d\n\n10\n\nTransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2210. Plaintiffs have made no allegations suggesting a risk of future\nharm to them is imminent or substantial.\nFor these reasons, I will GRANT Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Counts I, Il, and IV\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.* I will dismiss Count III as withdrawn.\n\n5 I do this with some hesitation. I am aware that, although a number of cases involving\nsimilar claims have been considered by other courts, my decision to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction is without an exact precedent. I attribute this to the fact that the\nprecise question and facts before me now differ from those that were before those other courts.\n\nIn Noom, Blue Nile, and Clicktale, the Northern District of California dismissed nearly\nidentical claims of wiretapping by providers of session replay software for failure to state a claim.\nGraham v. Noom, Inc., 533 F Supp.3d 823, 832 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (holding that because there were\nno allegations that the third party \u201cintercepted and used the data itself,\u201d plaintiff did not plausibly\nplead third party software provider eavesdropped on plaintiffs\u2019 communications, but pled only that\nthe third party was \u201ca vendor that provides a software service\u201d); Johnson v. Blue Nile, Inc., 2021\nWL 1312771 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2021) (similar); Yale v. Clicktale, Inc., 2021 WL 1428400 (N.D.\nCal. Apr. 15, 2021) (similar). In these cases, defendants argued (and the Court agreed) that,\nbecause plaintiffs failed to state a claim of eavesdropping under CIPA \u00a7 631(a), plaintiffs had\nsuffered no injury and therefore lacked standing for their CIPA \u00a7 635(a) claim regarding the\npossession of a device \u201cprimarily or exclusively designed or intended for eavesdropping.\u201d Noom,\n533 F.Supp.3d at 835; Blue Nile, 2021 WL 1312771, at *3; Clicktale, 2021 WL 1428400, at *3.\nDefendants did not, however, argue lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the CIPA \u00a7 631(a)\n\u201ceavesdropping\u201d claims.\n\nIn Saleh, Yoon, and Alhadeff, also involving session replay software, the Central District\nof California decided the Rule 12(b)(6) issue differently than did the Northern District of\nCalifornia cases. Defendants in Yoon and Alhadeff did not argue lack of subject matter jurisdiction\nat all, and defendant in Saleh, where plaintiff completed a purchase on defendant\u2019s website and\nthereby had his personal and payment information collected, did not argue lack of subject matter\njurisdiction over the CIPA \u00a7 631(a) eavesdropping claim. Saleh v. Nike, Inc., 2021 WL 4437734\n(C.D. Cal. Sept. 27, 2021) (holding plaintiff failed to state a claim that website owner\neavesdropped, plaintiff stated a claim that website owner aided in software provider\u2019s\neavesdropping, and plaintiff had no standing for his CIPA \u00a7 635 claim because he did not allege\nany injury from defendant\u2019s mere possession of an eavesdropping device); Yoon v. Lululemon\nUSA, Inc., 2021 WL 3615907 (C.D. Cal. July 15, 2021) (holding plaintiff did not state a claim for\nviolation of CIPA \u00a7 631(a)[ii] because she had not alleged third party intercepted \u201ccontent,\u201d but\ndid state a claim for violation of CIPA \u00a7 631(a)(iv) for aiding in wiretapping by \u201callow[ing] a third\nparty to access the communication.\u201d); Alhadeff v. Experian Info. Sol\u2019ns., Inc., 2021 WL 3615834\n\n11\n\nWI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss are GRANTED. Counts IJ, II,\nIll, and [V are DISMISSED.\n\nAn appropriate order will issue.\n\n(C.D. Cal. May 25, 2021) (holding defendant\u2019s own recording of plaintiff's part of the\nconversation was \u201csufficient to allege \u2018interception\u2019 [under Florida law}\u201d).\n\nThere are also Florida District Court cases addressing the same issues raised under Florida\nlaw, see Makkinje v. Extra Space Storage, Inc., 2022 WL 80437 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 7, 2022) (denying\nmotion to dismiss); Goldstein v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 2021 WL 4134774 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 9,\n2021) (granting motion to dismiss). Neither of these cases consider a motion to dismiss for lack\nof subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe only analogous cases I have seen where the question of concreteness was reached do\nnot involve session replay software and are inapposite for reasons I have explained. In Moosejaw,\nthe third party\u2019s embedded code was much more invasive than the session replay software at issue\nhere, as it redirected the plaintiff's communications to a third party in real time and allowed the\nthird party to \u201cscan{] [plaintiffs] computer for files that revealed his identity and browsing habits.\u201d\nRevitch v. New Moosejaw, LLC, 2019 WL 5485330 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 23, 2019). In Mastel, where\nneither party contested the private nature of the information defendants collected, the Court\u2019s\nconcreteness analysis focused on whether an invasion of privacy harm requires disclosure of\nprivate information and not, as is at issue here, whether an invasion of privacy harm requires the\ninvolvement of information that is private in the first place. Mastel v. Miniclip SA, 2021 WL\n2983198 (E.D. Cal. July 15, 2021).\n\n"}
