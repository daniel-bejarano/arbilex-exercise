No. 20 -1228- CFC- JLH \n(Consolidated)  \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \n \nPending before the Court are  the parties \u2019 claim construction  disputes  in four consolidated \ncases.  (C.A. Nos. 20 -1228;  20-1229;  20-1231;  20-1232.)   The se cases involve  four patents  \ndirected to aspects of communications systems.  The parties originally requested that the Court \nconstrue thirteen  disputed terms in five  patents, but they subsequently settled their claims \nregarding one of those patents.  (D.I. 142.1)  The parties were u nable to agree on the construction \nof any terms in the four remaining patents, and they are asking for construction of nine  terms.  \nThe four patents are U.S. Patent Nos. 6,784,653 (the \u201c \u2019653 patent \u201d), 7,068,950 (the \u201c \u2019950 \npatent \u201d), 7,613,938 (the \u201c\u2019938 patent \u201d), and 7,903,971 (the  \u201c\u2019971 patent \u201d).  I held a Markman \nhearing on May 25, 2022.  ( \u201cTr __. \u201d)  I recommend that the Court adopt the constructions set forth \nbelow : \n Term  Recommended Construction  \n1. \u201cdirectly connected \u201d  \n                         (\u2019653 patent , claim s 1 & 7) \u201cconnected only by conductors like wires \nor metal traces \u201d \n \n1 Docket citations refer to C.A.

LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Claim Construction  \nThe purpose of the claim construction  process is to \u201cdetermin[e] the meaning and scope of \nthe patent claims asserted to be infringed. \u201d  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, \n976 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  When the parties have an  actual dispute \n \n2 See infra  Discussion.     \n \n3 \n regarding the proper scope of claim  terms, their dispute must be resolved by the judge, not the \njury.  I d. at 979.  The Court only needs to construe a claim term if there is a dispute over its \nmeaning, and it only needs to be construed to the exten t necessary to resolve the dispute.  Vivid \nTechs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. & Eng\u2019 g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999).   \n\u201c[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for conducting claim construction. \u201d  Phillips v. \nAWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2005) .  But there are guiding principles.  Id.  \u201cThe \ninquiry into how a person of ordinary skill in the art understands a claim term provides an objective \nbaseline from which to begin claim interpretation. \u201d  Id. at 1313.  In some cases, the ord inary \nmeaning of a claim term, as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, is readily apparent even to a lay person and requires \u201c little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning \nof commonly understood words.\u201d   Id. at 1314.  Wher e the meaning is not readily apparent, \nhowever , the court may look to \u201c those sources available to the public that show what a person of \nskill in the art would have understood disputed claim language to mean.\u201d   Innova/Pure Water, Inc. \nv. Safari Water Filtration Sys., Inc., 381 F.3d 1111, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 2004) .  Those sources include \n\u201cthe words of the claims themselves, the remainder of the specification, the prosecution history, \nand extrinsic evidence concerning relevant scientific principles, the mean ing of technical terms, \nand the state of the art. \u201d  Id. \n\u201cThe claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim \nterms. \u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1314.  For example, \u201c the context in which a term is used in the \nasserted claim can be highly instructive.\u201d   Id.  Considering other, unasserted, claims can also be \nhelpful.  Id.  \u201c For example, the presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation \ngives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\u201d   \nId. at 1314\u2013 15.      \n \n4 \n In addition, the \u201c claims must be read in view of the specification, of which they are a part. \u201d  \nId. at 1315 (quoting Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ).  \nThe spe cification \u201cis always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. \u201d  Id. (quoting \nVitronics , 90 F.3d at 1582).  The specification may contain a special definition given to a claim \nterm by the patentee, in which case, the patentee\u2019 s lexicography governs .  Id. at 1316.  The \nspecification may also reveal an intentional disclaimer or disavowal of claim scope.  Id.   However, \n\u201ceven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, the claims of the patent will not \nbe read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope \nusing words or expressions of manifest exclusi on or restriction.\u201d   Hill -Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker \nCorp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal marks omitted).  \nCourts should also consider the patent \u2019s prosecution history.  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317.  \nIt may inform \u201cthe meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood \nthe invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making \nthe claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.\u201d   Id.  Statements made by a patentee or patent \nowne r durin g inter partes review  may also be considered.  Aylus Networks, Inc. v. Apple Inc., 856 \nF.3d 1353, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2017) . \nIn appropriate cases, courts may also consider extrinsic evidence, which \u201c consists of all \nevidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises. \u201d Markman, 52 F.3d at 980.  For example, dictionaries, \nespecially technical dictionaries, can be helpful resources during claim construction by providing insight into commonly accepted meanings of a term to those of skill in the art.  Phillips , 415 F.3d \nat 1318.  E xpert testimony can also be useful \u201cto ensure that the court \u2019s understanding of the \ntechnical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish    \n \n5 \n that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field. \u201d \nId.; see also Teva Pharm s. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 331\u201332 (2015).   \nB. Indefi niteness  \nSection 112 of Title 35 imposes a definiteness requirement on patent claims.  35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 112(b) (requiring that the claims \u201cparticularly  point[] out and distinctly claim[] the subject matter \nwhich the inventor . . . regards as the invention\u201d ).  \u201cThe primary purpose of the definiteness \nrequirement is to ensure that the claims are written in such a way that they give notice to the public \nof the extent of the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, \ne.g., competitors of the patent owner, can determine whether or not they infringe. \u201d  All Dental \nProdx, LLC v. Advantage Dental Prod., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779\u201380 (Fed. Cir. 2002).   \n\u201cA patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the spec ification \ndelineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\u201d   Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 \nU.S. 898, 901 (2014) .  Definiteness, like  claim construction, should be assessed from the viewpoint \nof a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the patent was filed, and it should be considered in view  of the patent \u2019s specification and prosecution history.  Id. at 908.   \nThe party asserting indefiniteness has the burden to prove it by clear and convincing \nevidence.  BASF Corp. v. Johnson Matthey Inc., 875 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2017). II. DISCUSSION  \nMy Report and Recommendation was announced from the bench on May 31, 2022, as \nfollows : \nI am prepared to issue a ruling on the disputes argued on \nWednesday , May 25, 2022.  I will not be issuing a separate written \nReport and R ecommendation, but we will file on the docket a \ntranscript of my oral ruling today . . . .  I want to emphasize before I    \n \n6 \n announce my recommendations that while I am not issuing a \nseparate written opinion, we have followed a full and thorough process before making the recommendations I am about to state.   \n We have reviewed the patents in suit.   Each side submitted \nlengthy technology tutorials.  There was also full briefing on each of the disputed terms.  The parties submitted their briefing in accordance with my procedures, so each side had the opportunity to submit two briefs, and they were combined into one joint claim construct ion brief incorporating all arguments.  The parties \u2019 joint \nclaim construction chart and brief also included numerous exhibits.  Those exhibits included portions of the prosecution histories relied on by the parties as w ell as voluminous expert declarations from \nDrs. Daniel Foty, Duncan MacFarlane, and Nathaniel Polish.  Neither party elected to put on live expert testimony.  \n Everything submitted has been carefully considered.  To be \nclear, while my oral ruling will cite to the evidence that I conclude \nbest support s my recommended constructions, my failure to cite to \nother evidence provided by the parties does not mean that I ignored or failed to consider it.  As I stated, I have considered all of the arguments and evidenc e cited by the parties.  \n I am not going to read into the record my understanding of \nthe general legal principles of claim construction.  I set forth the \nlegal standard in my opinion in 3Shape  A/S v. Align Tech., Inc.,\n3 and \nI incorporate that articulation by reference.  Defendant has also argued that a number of the disputed terms are indefinite.  My understanding of the law of indefiniteness was also set forth in 3Shape v. Align.\n4 \n  \n[\u201cdirectly connected \u201d] \n  The first t erm to be construed is \u201c directly connected.\u201d   That \nterm is found in claims 1 and 7 of the \u2019 653 patent .\n5  \n \n3 C.A. No. 18 -886, 2020 WL 2188857, at *1\u20132 (D. Del. May 6, 2020). \n \n4 Id. at *2.  \n \n5 Claim 1 recites:  \n  \n1. Eye monitor for evaluating a binary input signal of a \ntransmission link and for recognizing the edges of an eye diagram of the input signal, comprising a decision circuit which is directly connected to an integrator, wherein the input signal and a variable \n    \n \n7 \n   \nWSOU says that the phrase doesn \u2019t need construction or, \nalternatively, that it should be construed to mean \u201c connected \n[without an EXOR circuit] such that the output of the decision circuit corresponds to the input of the integrator. \u201d  Xilinx proposes \n\u201cconnected [by a wire or metal trace]  with nothing in between. \u201d \n  Notwithstanding Xilinx \u2019s use of the phrase \u201c nothing in \nbetween, \u201d the parties agree that there can be something between the \ndecision circuit and the integrator.  But they disagree about what connectors can be present and still r esult in the two components \nbeing \u201cdirectly connected.\u201d   Xilinx takes the narrow view \u2014only \nwires and metal traces connecting the decision circuit to the integrator fall within the phrase.   WSOU argues that the decision \ncircuit and the integrator can be directly connected even though there are other active components between them. According to WSOU, what makes a connection \u201c direct \u201d is that it does not \nmaterially change the encoded data.   \n The dispute is essentially whether the phrase can include \nsimple acti ve components used to transmit the signals from the \ndecision circuit to the integrator without changing the data, such as buffers, inverters, and amplifiers.   I agree with Xilinx that the term \n\u201cdirectly connected \u201d does not allow such active components.  \n  \nStarting with the language of the claim, the use of the word \n\u201cdirect\u201d  suggests that there is nothing else besides the wire or other \ncomponent that makes the connection.  That interpretation is \nconsistent with the specification, including F igure 3, which shows \nthe preferred embodiment with nothing besides an arrow connecting the decision circuit and the integrator.  The specification describes that figure as \u201c directly connected.\u201d   (\u2019653 patent 2:57\u201364.)  WSOU \n \nthreshold are provided to the decision circuit and wherein an output signal of the integrator is used to recognize the edges of the eye diagram.  \n \nClaim 7 recites:  \n  7. Method of evaluating a binary input signal of a \ntransmission link and of recognizing the edges of an eye diagram of the input signal, wherein a decision circuit is directly connected to an integrator, and comprising the steps of providing the input signal and a variable threshold to the decision circuit and using an output signal of the integrator to recognize the edges of the eye diagram.     \n \n8 \n offered no evidence that a person of skill in the art would understand \nthe figures or language differently.   \n  Instead, WSOU points out that the specification described \n\u201c[t]he difference between the\u201d  preferred embodiment and the prior \nart as the removal of an \u201cEXOR circuit. \u201d  (Id.)  According to WSOU, \nthen, \u201cdirectly connected \u201d could be read to mean any circuit without \nan EXOR.   \n  The problem for WSOU is that, ultimately, the scope of the \ninvention is described by the claims ; the patentee is not entitled to \neverything not in the prior art.  The patent could have claimed any circuit without an EXOR.  The patent could have said in the specification that certain other components could be part of a \u201c direct \nconnection.\u201d   It did neither.   \n  Although WSOU suggests that its proposal better captures \nthe purpose of the invention, it fails to do so.  The specification teaches that the \u201cdirect connection \u201d is advantageous because EXOR \ncircuits operate too slowly for modern high bit -rate channels, but a \n\u201cdirect connection \u201d can operate above 10 gigabits per second.  ( Id. \n2:14\u201337.)  A person of skill in the art would recognize many other \ncomponents that had the same problem as the prior art \u2019s EXOR.\n6  \nFor example, WSOU suggested at oral argument that a \u201c direct \nconnection\u201d  could include any number of NAND and NOR circuits.  \n(Tr. 21:16\u2013 22:5.)  It would d efeat the purpose of this invention to \ninclude [all combinations of] such components in this phrase.   \n  \nAccordingly, I recommend that the term \u201c directly \nconnected \u201d be construed to mean \u201cconnected only by conductors \nlike wires or metal traces. \u201d   \n  \n[\u201cdecision circuit \u201d] \n  \nThe second term to be construed is \u201c decision circuit. \u201d  That \nterm is also found in claims 1 and 7 of the \u2019 653 patent.  \n  \nWSOU says the term needs no construction and should be \ngiven its plain and ordinary meaning.  To resolve the parties \u2019 \ndispute, WSOU has clarified that it thinks the plain and ordinary \nmeaning  is \u201ca circuit capable of generating an output signal based \non a comparison of an input signal against another criterion.\u201d   Xilinx \nargues the term should be construed to mean a \u201ccircuit that decides \nwhether an input signal is a binary \u2018 1\u2019 or \u20180\u2019 by compari ng the input \n \n6 See, e .g., D.I. 135, Ex. 1 (Foty Decl.) \u00b6 \u00b6 53\u201361.     \n \n9 \n signal to the variable threshold.\u201d   The crux of their dispute is \nwhether the claimed \u201cdecision circuit\u201d  is limited to circuits whose \ninput signal can only be one of two states (not including noise).   \n  \nThe Plaintiff\u2019 s expert, Dr. Polish, note s that in the art a \ndecision circuit can refer to circuits that decide between inputs with more than two states.\n7  That may be true, but it is not how the term \nis used in the \u2019 653 patent. \n  First, the claims say that \u201c a binary  input signal of a \ntransmission link . . . and a variable threshold are provided to the decision circuit.\u201d   Second, the claims are consistent with the \ndescription in the specification, which discloses that \u201c a binary  input \nsignal of a transmission link . . . and a variable threshold are provided to the decision circuit.\u201d   (\u2019653 patent  2:23\u201329.) Third, the \nspecification teaches that a central improvement of the invention is a novel integrator, which identifies the edge s of the input signal by \nthe ratios of ones and zeros output by the \u201c decision circuit\u201d  at \ndifferent thresholds.  (Id . 2:25\u20134: 2.)  Therefore, the claimed decision \ncircuit must have both a binary input and a binary output. Indeed, the very concept of any \u201c eye diagram \u201d and an \u201c eye monitor \u201d \nrequires an input signal with two levels : the edges of the signal that \nform the top and bottoms of the eye and, if the signal is clear, nothing in between.\n8     \n  \nAccordingly, I recommend that the Court construe a \n\u201cdecision circuit\u201d  as a \u201ccircuit that decides whether an input signal \nis a binary \u2018 1\u2019 or \u20180\u2019 by comparing the input signal to a threshold.\u201d    \n  \n[\u201can analyzer configured to . . .\u201d]  \n  \nThe third term to be construed is \u201c an analyzer configured (i) \nto analyze spectral power of an input signal corresponding to the carrier and data signals, the spectral power being in a spectral band corresponding to a spectral null of the input signal, and (ii) to generate a control signal based on the analysis.\u201d   This term is found \nin claim 1 of the \u2019 950 patent.\n9   \n \n7 (D.I. 135, Ex. 13 (Polish Decl.) \u00b6\u00b6 69, 72\u201373.)    \n \n8 (Id., Fig. 2, \u00b6 40.)  \n \n9 Claim 1 recites:  \n \n1. An apparatus for reducing misalignment between a carrier \nsignal and a data signal, the apparatus comprising:  \n    \n \n10 \n  \nThere are essentially three disputes about this phase.  First, \nthe parties disagree whether this term is a means- plus-function term \ngoverned by [pre -AIA] 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6.  Xilinx says it is, but \nWSOU counters that the word \u201c analyzer \u201d connotes sufficiently \ndefinite structure to inform a person of skill in the art about its scope without invoking means -plus-function rules.   \n  Claims without the word \u201c means \u201d are presumed not to be \nmeans- plus-function.  But that presumption is rebutted if a claim \ndoes not recite \u201c sufficient structure for performing [a claimed] \nfunction.\u201d\n10  \n  There is no real dispute that there are several kinds of \n\u201canalyzers\u201d  a person of skill in this art would recognize.  The claim \nlanguage expressly refers to an \u201c analyzer configured [] to analyze \nspectral power of an input signal. \u201d  That suggests the claimed \nanalyzer is a spectrum  analyzer.  Consistent with that, WSOU argues \nthat, in the context of the cl aim, a person of skill in the art would \nrecognize the claimed analyzer to refer to a spectrum  analyzer.  The \nparties agree that spectrum analyzers that measure the power in a spectral band are well -known in the art.\n11  For example, a person of \nskill in the  art would recognize that Figure s 3A, 3B, and 8A were \nmade by a spectrum analyzer.12  \n  \nThe problem with WSOU \u2019s argument is that the \u201c analyzer \u201d \nrequired by claim 1 does more than just measure the input \u2019s power \nspectrum \u2014the claim also requires the analyzer to analyze the power \n \n(a) an analyzer configured (i) to analyze spectral power of \nan input signal corresponding to the carrier and data \nsignals, the spectral power being in a spectral band corresponding to a spectral null of the input signal, and (ii) to generate a control signal based on the analysis; and  \n(b) a phase shifter configured to introduce a phase shift \nbetween the data signal and a clock signal using the control signal, wherein the carrier signal is based on the clock signal.  \n \n10 Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC , 792 F.3d 1339, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting Watts \nv. XL Sys., Inc ., 232 F.3d 877, 880 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  \n \n11 (E.g., D.I. 135, Ex. 14 (Polish Repl y Decl.) \u00b6 42 , Ex. 5; Tr.  61:1\u201322.)  \n \n12 (See D.I. 135, Ex. 13 (Polish Decl.)  \u00b6 104.)     \n \n11 \n spectrum in a spectral band around a spectral null and generate a \ncontrol signal based on the analysis.  The claim recites no structure \nto perform that function besides the generic term \u201c analyzer. \u201d  And \nnone of the references WSOU cites about generic spectrum analyzers disclose the ability to perform that function.   \n Plaintiff\u2019 s expert, Dr. Polish, says in his opening \n[declaration ] that a person of skill in the art would understand that \nthe claimed \u201canalyzer \u201d is a structure that can analyze spectral power \nand generate a control signal based on the analysis.\n13  But that \u2019s not \nsaying anything.  Those are the claimed functions, and the law \nrequires that the claimed analyzer be a structure that can perform them.  The law also requires the claims to include objective \nguidelines about what structures are claimed beyond merely the ability to perform the claimed functions.\n14  Dr. Polish \u2019s statement \ndoesn\u2019 t shed any light on whether the word \u201c analyzer \u201d connotes \nsufficient guideline s to one of skill in the art.  And neither party has \npresented other evidence that a person of  skill in the art would know \na definite category of \u201c analyzers \u201d that could perform the claimed \nsecond function.   \n  WSOU suggests a person of skill in the art cou ld program a \nspectrum analyzer to perform the claimed second function.  \u201c But the \nfact that one of skill in the art could program a computer to perform the recited function[] cannot create structure where none otherwise \nis disclosed. \u201d\n15  I therefore find, b ased on the record before me, that \nthe claim does not recite to one of skill in the art sufficient structure \nto perform the claimed second function.  Accordingly, the term \u201canalyzer \u201d should be construed as a means -plus-function limitation.  \n  This brings me  to the second and third disputes.  The second \ndispute is about what structures correspond to the claimed functions and whether the corresponding structure has to include an algorithm.  \n  \n \n13 (D.I. 135, Ex. 13 ( Polish Decl. ) \u00b6 96.)   \n \n14 Williamson , 792 F.3d at  1349 ( citing  Greenberg v. Ethicon Endo- Surgery, Inc ., 91 F.3d \n1580, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ); see also Nevro v. Bos. Sci . Corp ., 955 F.3d 35, 39 (Fed. Cir. 2020) \n(\u201c[T]he ambiguity inherent in functional terms may be resolved where the patent \u2018provides a \ngeneral guideline and examples sufficient to enable a person of or dinary skill in the art to determine \nthe scope of the claims. \u2019\u201d (quoting Enzo Biochem. Inc. v. Applera Corp., 599 F.3d 1325, 1335 \n(Fed. Cir. 2010) )). \n \n15 Williamson , 792 F.3d at 1351 (citing Function Media, LLC v. Google, Inc., 708 F.3d \n1310, 1319 (Fed. Cir.  2013)).     \n \n12 \n As I understand it, there is no real dispute that there are two \nfunctions recited in the claim, that the corresponding structure has \nto include at least a spectrum analyzer like the example in Figure 5, \nand that a spectrum analyzer has to include at least a processor.   \nWhere the parties disagree is that Xilinx argues that the corresponding structure must also include a specific algorithm, and WSOU says, essentially, that the spectrum analyzer \u2014with a \nprocessor \u2014is sufficient corresponding structure.  \n I agree with Xilinx that the corresponding structure must \ninclude an algori thm.  Whether it \u2019s the processor in the spectrum \nanalyzer that generates the control signal or it\u2019 s a specialized \nprocessor, the case law has consistently held that when a mean -plus-\nfunction claim requires a computer to perform a specific function, the cla im is limited to algorithms disclosed to accomplish that [and \ntheir equivalents] .\n16  Generating a control signal from the  power in \na spectral null is a specific function, so the corresponding structure  \nmust  include an algorithm.  \n  Turning to the final dispute, Xilinx says that the claim is \nindefinite because the specification fails to disclose an algorithm that can perform the claimed function.  This is a close question because, on the one hand, WSOU \u2019s proposed corresponding \nstructure does not identify where an algorithm is disclosed in the specification, instead taking the position that the term was not a \n[\u00a7] 112 [\u00b6] 6 limit ation and the alternative position that, even if it \nwere, the proper construction did not need to include an algorithm.   \nOn the other hand, it is Xilinx\u2019 s burden to demonstrate by clear and \nconvincing evidence that no algorithm is disclosed in the \nspecification for performing the claimed function.  Having carefully reviewed the patent and Xilinx\u2019 s expert declaration, I cannot find on \nthis record that Xilinx has met that burden.  \n In coming to that conclusion, I note that the specification \nisn\u2019t completely silent about how the second function is performed.  \nThe disclosure may not fill in every detail, but \u201c a means- plus-\nfunction clause is indefinite \u201d only \u201cif a person of ordinary skill in \nthe art would be unable to recognize the structure in the specification and associate it with the corresponding function in the claim. \u201d\n17 \n  Accordingly, I recommend that the Court deny Xilinx\u2019 s \nindefiniteness argument with leave to renew it at the summary \n \n16 See, e.g., Noah Sys., Inc. v. Intuit Inc ., 675 F.3d 1302, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2012) . \n \n17 AllVoice Computing PLC v. Nuance Comm s., Inc., 504 F.3d 1236, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2007).     \n \n13 \n judgment stage of the case.  The parties can address the question of \nwhether the specification discloses an algorithm at that time.  The most I can say now is that the analyzer should be construed as a means- plus-function term and that the corresponding structure must \ninclude at least a spectrum analyzer and an algorithm di sclosed in \nthe specification that can perform the claimed second function.  \n  \n[\u201c[input]/[data -modulated] signal corresponding to the carrier \nand data signals \u201d] \n  The fourth term to be construed is an \u201c [input]/[data -\nmodulated] signal corresponding to the carrier and data signals.\u201d   \nThese terms are found in claims 1 and 17 of the  \u2019950 patent .\n18 \n  The parties agree both terms should be given the same \nconstruction, but dispute whether it should be limited to optical applications.\n19  WSOU argues the terms should be given their plain \nand ordinary meaning.  WSOU doesn\u2019 t say what that plain and \nordinary meaning is, but it says it can include signals from non-optical systems.  Xilinx argues that the disputed phrases should each be construed as \u201c an input signal corresponding to a modulated \noptical signal. \u201d \n  Starting with the independent claims in which the disputed \nterms appear, they are not limited to optical signals .  Nor do they \nrecite any devices the parties argue are specific to optics, whereas dependent claims 9 \u201314 and 26 do.  That suggests that the \nindependent claims should not be limited to optical signals.  \n \n \n18 Claim 17 recites:  \n17. A method of reducing misalignment between a carrier \nsignal and a data signal, comprising the steps of:  \n(i) analyzing spectral power of a data -modulated signal \ncorresponding to the carrier and data signals, the spectral power being in a spectral band corresponding to a spectral null of the data -\nmodulated signal; and  \n(ii) introducing a phase shift between the data signal and a \nclock signal based on the analysis, wherein the carrier signal is based on the clock signal.  \n \n19 I am not convinced that either party\u2019s construction accurately captures this claim term.   \nHowever,  my recommendation is limited to the dispute presented to the Court  and the evidence of \nrecord .    \n \n14 \n Turning to the specification, it is true that the patent\u2019 s \npreferred embodiments are all optical systems.   (\u2019950 patent  3:49\u2013\n4:41.)  But the patent refers to those embodiments as \u201c one \nembodiment of the present invention. \u201d  (Id. 3:42\u201343, 4:1.)  And the \nspecification expressly says that the invention is not limited to \noptics.   (Id. 3:1\u201314, 6:32\u201339.)   That suggests that the inventor did \nnot understand the disputed phrases to be restricted to optical signals.  \n  Xilinx argues that, all that notwithstanding, the \u2019950 patent \nsolves a problem that is unique to optics, but it cites no evidence to \nsupport th at argument.  \n  Accordingly, I reject Xilinx \u2019s argument that those terms \nshould be limited to signals in optical systems.  \n  \n[\u201cspectral null \u201d & \u201ca spectral band corresponding to a spectral \nnull\u201d] \n  The fifth and sixth terms to be construed are \u201cspectral null \u201d \nand \u201ca spectral band corresponding to a spectral null. \u201d  Both phrases \nare found in claims 1 and 17 of the \u2019 950 patent.  \n  WSOU says that \u201c spectral null\u201d  does not need to be \nconstrued or, in the a lternative, that it be construed to mean \u201c loss or \nreduction of power indicative of misalignment.\u201d   Xilinx proposes a \nconstruction of \u201c a frequency at which the amount of energy \ntransmitted is at a minimum. \u201d  The parties agree that a spectral null \nbroadly re fers to a negative peak in spectral power.   The parties \nnitpick each other \u2019s proposed constructions, but it became clear at \noral argument that the real dispute here is whether the term \u201cspectral \nnull,\u201d  as used in the claim, refers to a single frequency or  a range of \nfrequencies.   \n  WSOU clarified during argument that it believes \u201c a spectral \nnull,\u201d  as used in the claims, means the entire frequency range of the \ncurve that forms a negative peak, including both the tip of a peak and the curves on either side.   In other words, WSOU argues that \nevery frequency where power decreases because of misalignment is part of a spectral null, not just the frequency where  it decreases most  \n(or, at least, more than all the nearby frequencies ).  Xilinx says that \nonly the loc al minimum itself, i.e., the point of a negative peak, is a \nclaimed \u201c spectral null. \u201d   \n  Both sides make reasonable arguments grounded in the \nspecification to support their respective positions on the meaning of    \n \n15 \n \u201cspectral null. \u201d But at this point in time, I don \u2019t understand the \nparties\u2019  dispute about the meaning of \u201cspectral null \u201d to have any \nimplications to the case aside from defining the \u201c spectral band.\u201d   \nThe Court only needs to construe the claims to the extent needed to \nresolve a dispute.  Accordingly, I recommend that the Court decline at this point to construe \u201cspectral null \u201d separately from \u201ca spectral \nband corresponding to a spectral null.\u201d    \n  As for the \u201c spectral band corresponding to a spectral null, \u201d \nWSOU says that it \u2019s not indefinite and that it should be given its \nplain and ordinary meaning, which is \u201c a frequency band that \ninclude s at least a frequency \u201d where power is reduced if misaligned.  \nXilinx says that the spectral band must include at least the frequency of the negative peak of the spectral null but that the phrase spectral band is indefinite because it has no outer limits o n how wide the \nband can be. On this record, I find that Xilinx has failed to meet its burden to establish indefiniteness by clear and convincing evidence.   \n  According to the specification, a \u201c spectral band \u201d could be \nnarrow or broad.  In one example , the \u2019950 patent  suggests choosing \na 6 GHz wide band centered on a spectral null.  ( \u2019950 patent  4:64\u2013\n5:2, 5:13\u201318.)  In other examples , the band is only 2 GHz wide.  ( Id. \n4:4\u20137.)  . . . [T]he record does not reflect any reason to  think that the \nband must include the tip of the peak to see an increase or decrease in total power.  It seems possible that including the minimum as \nXilinx suggests might improve contrast, which might be why the preferred embodiments are designed that way, but embodiments are \nnot limiting.  Indeed, the specification mentions that the \u201c spectral \nband\u201d  may be \u201cnear a [spectral] null, \u201d which suggests that the \nclaimed \u201cspectral band \u201d does not need to include the tip of the \nnegative peak to work.  ( Id. 2: 7\u201311, 4 :1\u20134 (emphasis added) . \n  The \u2019950 patent  teaches that an \u201c analyzer \u201d can detect \nmisalignment by measuring the decrease in power around a spectral null.   ( Id. 4:1\u201312, 5:50\u20136:19.)  That suggests that a person of skill \nin the art would recognize that the \u201c spectral band \u201d must be limited \nonly to parts of the spectrum with this  behavior \u2014frequencies where \npower decreases if the signals are misaligned.  The record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that a person of skill in the art would not understand how to determine which parts of the spectrum will behave this way m athematically or experimentally.  \nThus, Xilinx has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that this term is indefinite.  \n In light of my recommendation on the issue of \nindefiniteness, and my conclusion that the claimed spectral band    \n \n16 \n does not need to inc lude the tip of the negative peak, it \u2019s unclear to \nme whether there are any additional disputes that would benefit from \nfurther construction of the phrase.  So, I will direct the parties to \nmeet and confer within seven  days of the Court posting this R eport \nand Recommendation in written version on the docket [to] see if \nthey can agree about whether the Court needs to engage in additional construction of the claim term in light of what I said and []  if they \ncan agree about what the construction should be  in light of what I \nsaid.  The parties shall file a joint status  report within fourteen  days \n[after the written version is put on the docket ], setting forth their \nagreement or their respective position s.  The joint status report shall \nbe no more than six pages, single spaced  [in no smaller than 12-\npoint font] . \n  \n[\u201coperable independent of the controller \u201d] \n  The next term is \u201c operable independent of the controller.\u201d   \nThis phrase is found in claim 13 of the \u2019 938 patent .\n20 \n The parties agree that the claimed \u201c electrical power device, \noperable independent of the controller ,\u201d must be, at a minimum, \ncapable of operating while the controller is powered down.  Xilinx argues that this term requires the electrical power device to only \u201c[o]perat[e] separately from signals or commands of the controller. \u201d \n \nXilinx relies on the prosecution history of the \u2019 938 patent  \nwhere the applicant distinguished the \u2019938 patent  from prior art by \narguing, among other differences, that the prior art did not disclose \nany independent operation.  According to the applicant, the \u201cIA\u201d in \nthe prior art was barely more than a middleman \u2014it passed shutdown \n \n20 Claim 13 recites:  \n \n13. A circuit card comprising:   \none or m ore devices,  \na controller for controlling operation of the circuit card,  \na switch responsive to a command received from the \ncontroller, for causing electrical power to at least one device to be decoupled therefrom for a predetermined period of time, and  \nan electrical power device, operable independent of the \ncontroller, that causes electrical power to the at least one device and the controller to be restored after the predetermined time period if the electrical power was also decoupled from the controller.  \n    \n \n17 \n signals between three devices and never restarted the power while \nthe controller was powered down.21 \n  Essentially what Xilinx is saying is that because the prior art \ndevice distinguished in the prosecution history did not shut down or restart without a signal from a controller that both types of independent operation should be required by the claim term.  I \u2019m \nnot sure the applicant needed to distinguish the prior art by its inability to shut down independentl y when the prior art did not \ndisclose restarting independently either, but the cited portions of the prosecution history do not amount to a clear disclaimer of scope.  The only thing that \u2019s clear from the cited portions is that the \napplicant thought the ex aminer misunderstood the prior art.  \n Claim 13 does not expressly require the \u201c electrical power \ndevice \u201d to independently power down any device \u2014in claim 13 the \n\u201ccontroller\u201d  and the \u201cswitch \u201d power devices down then the \n\u201celectrical power device \u201d may re -power them after a predetermined \nperiod.  Xilinx\u2019 s position misconstrues the prosecution history and \nadds a limitation to claim 13 not rooted in either the claim language \nor the specification.  \n  Accordingly, I reject Xilinx \u2019s proposal.  I am not sure that \nthe plain language of this claim fully captures the meaning of the term.  Based on the discussion at oral argument, I recommend that \n\u201coperable independent of the controller\u201d  be construed as \u201c able to \noperate while the controller is powered down.\u201d    \n  \n[\u201cwherein the plurality of signal states and the number of bits in \neach sequence are increased \u201d] \n \nThe next phrase to be construed is \u201c wherein the plurality of \nsignal states and the number of bits in each sequence are increased. \u201d  \nThis phrase is found in claims 1 and 15 of the \u2019 971 patent .\n22 \n \n21 D.I. 135, Ex. 4; see also  U.S. Pat. App. 2002/0023233 (prior art \ndistinguished by applicant) . \n \n22 Claim 1 recites:  \n \n1. A method of operating a passive optical network \ncomprising an optical line termination being connected via a plurality of optical fibers to a plurality of network terminations and \ncomprising the step of generating an optical signal for transmission over one of the plurality of optical fibers, the optical signal including \n    \n \n18 \n   \nWSOU says this term should be given its plain and ordinary \nmeaning, but it did not offer any proposal about what that plain and ordinary meaning is.  Xilinx says the claims should be construed as \u201cwherein an increase in the plurality of signal states and the number \nof bits in each sequence is performed automatically by the optical line termination. \u201d  It appeared from the briefing that the parties \nactual ly had two disputes: whether the change must be automatic \nand whether the change must be performed by the optical line termination (OLT).  But at oral argument, Xilinx clarified that the real dispute it wants to resolve is whether the increase is performed  \n\u201cautomatically \u201d and that it would be amenable to a construction that \ndoes not require that the change must be performed by the OLT. \n  Although the claim itself does not use the word \n\u201cautomatically, \u201d I agree with Xilinx that the disputed phrase does \nnot al low the type of manual change WSOU appears to want to \ncover.  As an initial matter, the claims recite that the change is made based on transmission quality.  If the configuration of the system and claimed method of operating it permits the transmission qua lity \nto materially change without the signal state changing, as WSOU appears to contend, I don\u2019 t understand how the signal state changes \nare based on the transmission quality.   \n  \nThat is consistent with the specification, where all the \nembodiments feature network devices that make the change \n \na plurality of signal states, each signal state corresp onding to a \ndifferent sequence of bits, wherein the plurality of signal states and the number of bits in each sequence are increased based on a transmission quality of the optical signal on the one of the plurality of optical fibers.  \n  \nClaim 15 recites:  \n 15. A method of operating a passive optical network \ncomprising an optical line termination being connected via a \nplurality of optical fibers to a plurality of network terminations and comprising the step of generating an optical signal for transmission over one of the plurality of optical fibers, the optical signal including \na plurality of signal states, each signal state corresponding to a different sequence of bits, wherein the plurality of signal states and the number of bits in each sequence are increased based on a transmission quality of the optical signal on the one of the plurality of optical fibers.  \n    \n \n19 \n automatically.23  The specification contrasts the invention with \u201c pre-\ndefined \u201d signaling modes where a user controls the signaling mode.  \n(\u2019971 patent  1:16\u201324, 5:31\u201344.)  Finally, while I believe that this \ndispute might be resolved on the intrinsic evidence, I note that \nXilinx submitted an expert declaration in support of its position and \nWSOU offered no evidence to suggest a person of skill in the art \nwould understand the claims to cover manually setting the signaling \nmode.24 \n  \nI thus reject WSOU \u2019s position that the change can be \nmanual.  Accordingly, I recommend that \u201c wherein the plurality of \nsignal states and the number of bits in each sequence are increased \u201d \nbe construed as \u201c wherein an increase in the plurality of signal states \nand the number of bits in each sequence  is performed \nautomatically. \u201d \n  \n[\u201cbased on a transmission quality of the optical signal \u201d] \n I now turn to the final term, \u201c based on a transmission quality \nof the optical signal. \u201d  This phrase is also found in claims 1 and 15 \nof the \u2019 971 patent . \n  Xilinx argues that this term should be construed as \u201c based \non analysis and evaluation of a characteristic of the optical signal. \u201d  \nWSOU says it  wants the plain and ordinary meaning but argues for \nsomething totally different \u2014W SOU wants this term to mean any \nchange related to the quality of the signal, even if no characteristic of the signal is ever measured, analyzed, or evaluated.   \n  I reject WS OU\u2019s argument.  The claim language clearly \nrequires the change to be based on the quality of the optical signal.  No reasonable interpretation of the words \u201c based on\u201d  would include \na change that was not somehow inspired by a quantitative \nmeasurement of the quality.   \n I\u2019m not sure the Court needs to adopt a construction to reject \nWSOU\u2019 s position, but I agree that Xilinx \u2019s proposed construction \ncaptures the plain meaning of the term.  Accordingly, I recommend \n \n23 See GPNE Corp. v. Apple Inc ., 830 F.3d 1365, 1370 (Fed.
