(D.I. 5).  Defendant s Nokia Corporation, Nokia of \nAmerica Corporation, Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy, and Nokia Technologies Oy \n(collectively \u201cNokia\u201d ) oppose remand  and the award  of Continental\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs .  \n(D.I. 9).  For the reasons set forth below, Continental\u2019s  motion will be granted -in-part and denied -\nin-part, and this action will be remanded to the  Delaware Court of Chancery . \nI. BACKGROUND  \nContinental  is a \u201cprovider of cutting- edge automotive components, including gateway \nproducts, telematics control units (TCUs), network access devices (NADs) and other devices that use telecommunications technology\u201d  and implement various cellular standards .  (D.I. 1 -1, Ex. A, \n\u00b6\u00b6 1, 7).  Nokia claims to own certain patents that  are essential to cellular standards adopted by \nvarious standard- setting organizations ( \u201cSSOs \u201d).  (Id. \u00b6 4).  Patents that are essential to a given \nstandard are referred to as standard -essential patents or SEPs.  Continental alleges that Nokia\u2019s \npatents ar e \u201csubject to the express and voluntary promises Nokia made to the relevant SSOs \npursuant to their Intellectual Property Rights ( \u201cIPR\u201d) Policies.   (Id. \u00b6 5).  Such IPR Policies all  \nrequire Nokia to license its alleged SEPs to any user of the standard that requests a license, and \n[to] do so on [ fair, reasonable, and non- discriminatory (\u201cFRAND\u201d)]  terms and conditions.\u201d   (Id.)  \nContinental has been seeking a license on FRAND terms from Nokia since 2017.  ( Id. \u00b6 8).  \nAfter failing to come to an agreement , on Ja nuary 25, 2021, Continental filed a breach of contract  \naction in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that Nokia refused \u201cto license [SEPs] relevant \nto the 2G, 3G, and 4G cellular standards to Continental and its suppliers on [FRAND] terms.\u201d  (Id. 2 \u00b6 1).  Continental alleged that \u201cNokia has been targeting Continental customers ,\u201d \u201cdemand [ing]  \nnon-FRAND rates, and threaten [ing] patent infringement lawsuits and injunctions \u201d against \nContinental customers.  (Id. \u00b6 48).  Continental allege d that Nokia has engaged  in \u201cmisbehavior\u201d \nand has \u201cattempted various half -measures in an effort to create the misleading impression that it \nwas willing to deal with Continental and other suppliers.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 50-51).  It was not until \nSeptember 2020 that Nokia offered Continenta l a \u201cpartial direct license to Nokia\u2019s SEPs\u201d but the \noffered terms  were \u201cstill deficient and non -FRAND in numerous respects .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 52).  Continental \nasked the Chancery Court to \u201c(1)  address Nokia\u2019s breaches of contract, (2) obtain a declaration \nthat Continental is entitled to a direct license covering all of its products w hich practice the cellular \nstandards, (3) obtain a declaration that Nokia\u2019s demanded terms are not FRAND, and (4) obtain, \nthrough injunctive relief, a FRAND license to Nokia\u2019s SEPs.\u201d   (Id. \u00b6 11).   In its  declaratory \njudgment count, Continental request ed, among other things, a \u201c determination that Nokia\u2019s patent \nrights are exhausted when Continental uses a Qualcomm chip, by virtue of Nokia\u2019s agreement with \nQualcomm .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 79). \nOn March 5, 2021, Nokia  filed a Notice of Removal asserting that \u201c this Court ha s original \nfederal question jurisdiction over claims involving patent exhaustion action under  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1367. \u201d  (D.I. 1  \u00b6 1).  Thereafter, Continental  filed the instant motio n to remand this \naction  to the Delaware Court of Chancery  and for an award of fees and costs .  (D.I. 5) .  Briefing \non the instant motion was completed on April 2, 2021.  (D.I. 10).1 \n \n1  On April 9, 2021, Nokia  filed a motion to dismiss  this case (D.I. 11), which Continental  \nhas opposed (D.I . 22).  On April 20, 2021, Nokia filed a motion to transfer venue (D.I. 16), \nwhich Continenta l has opposed ( D.I. 2 9).  Because the Court will grant Continental\u2019s \nmotion to remand, Nokia\u2019s motions to dismiss (D.I. 11) and transfer (D.I. 16) are denied \nas mo ot and may be raised, to the extent appropriate, with the Chancery Court. 3 II. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n\u2018\u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,\u2019 poss essing \u2018only that power authorized \nby Constitution and statute.\u2019\u201d  Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 256 (2013) (citing Kokkonen v. \nGuardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994)).  \u201c[T]he party asserting federal \njurisdiction in a removal case bea rs the burden of showing . . . that the case is properly before the \nfederal court.\u201d   Frederico v. Home Depot , 507 F.3d 188, 193 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Samuel \u2013Bassett \nv. Kia Motors Am., Inc., 357 F.3d 392, 396 (3d Cir. 2004)).  A district court shall remand a removed \ncase \u201cif at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).  The removal statute is strictly construed, requiring remand to state court if any doubt exists over whether removal was proper.  See Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets , 313 U.S. 100, 104 (1941).  \nFederal question jurisdiction is established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, which provides that \u201c[t]he \ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arisin g under the Constitution, \nlaws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d  Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions \n\u201carising under\u201d federal patent law under 28 U.S.C . \u00a7 1338(a ).  That exclusive jurisdiction is not \nunlimited, however, and \u201c\u00a7 1338(a) jurisdiction . . . extend[s] only to those cases in which a well -\npleaded complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff\u2019s righ t to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial ques tion of federal \npatent law, in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the well -pleaded claims.\u201d  \nChristianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 808- 09 (1988).  A case invoking a \n\u201cfederal patent -law defense does not, for that reason al one, \u2018arise under\u2019 patent law\u201d and therefore \nfederal question subject matter jurisdiction might not exist in all cases that reference patent law.  Id. at 809 (quoting Franchise Tax Bd. of State of Cal. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Tr. for S. Cal., 4 463 U.S. 1, 13 (1983)).  For a claim to \u201carise under\u201d patent law, the reason the plaintiff may or \nmay not be entitled to relief for their claim, or the overall success of the claim, must relate to patent \nlaw.  See id . at 809- 10.   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nContinental  argues tha t the Court should remand this action because , pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1447(c),  \u201cthis case does not raise a question of federal law  and, consequently, there is no federal \nsubject matter jurisdiction .\u201d  (D.I. 5).  The Court agrees.  As discussed below, Noki a has not shown \nthat Continental\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment regarding patent exhaustion created federal \nquestion jurisdic tion.   \nA. This Court Does Not Have Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over \nContinental\u2019s Breach of Contract Claims   \n \n1. Patent Exhaust ion, a Defense to Patent Infringement , Does Not \nEstablish  Subject Matter Jurisdiction  in This Case.   \n \nAs noted above, f ederal p atent  jurisdiction \u201cextend[s] only to those cases in which a well -\npleaded complaint establishes either that federal patent law cr eates the cause of action or that the \nplaintiff \u2019s right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal \npatent law, in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the well -pleaded claims.\u201d  \nChristianson, 486 U.S. at 808- 09.  This two- pronged analysis is  sometimes referred to as the \n\u201cChristianson test.\u201d  To evaluate whether patent law is a necessary element of the well -pleaded \nclaims, a court must look to \u201cthe face of the plaintiff\u2019s properly pleaded complaint.\u201d  Caterpi llar \nInc. v. Williams , 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987).  Here,  Nokia argues that subject matter jurisdiction \nexists because Continental\u2019s declaratory judgment claim references patent exhaustion.  (D.I. 9 at \n5).   5 The Federal Circuit has held that patent jurisdiction does not extend to a case solely because \nof reference to a patent law defense.  See ExcelStor Techs., Inc. v. Papst Licensing GmbH & Co. \nKG, 541 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008) .  More specifically, \u201c[a] claim does not arise under the patent \nlaws if a patent  issue appears only in a defense to that claim\u201d and \u201cpatent exhaustion is a defense \nto patent infringement, not a cause of action.\u201d  Id . at 1376.  In ExcelStor , the Federal Circuit \ndetermin ed that  federal patent  jurisdiction did not exist  because \u201cpatent l aw [was] not a necessary \nelement\u201d of analyzing whether the defendants were improperly collecting two sets of royalties  in \ncontravention of the licensing agreement .  Id. at 1377.  Because the royalt y determinations and \ninterpretation of the licensing agreement were not substantial questions of patent law,  and thus not \nwithin the ambit of the federal court, the claims  were \u201cproperly made . . . by state . . . courts, under \nstate law of contract and fraud.\u201d  Id .  Therefore , the court determined that  citing patent exhaustion \nas a basis for subject matter jurisdiction  showed a \u201cfundamental [] misunderst and[ing] [of]  the \nnature of the patent exhaustion doctrine\u201d  because \u201cpatent exhaustion is a defense to patent \ninfringement, not a cause of action.\u201d   Id. at 1376.  \nThis Court is persuaded that ExcelStor  applies here .  As in ExcelStor , here, patent law is \nnot a \u201cnecessary element\u201d of Continental\u2019s claim that Nokia has breached its contractual \nobligations to licens e SEPs on FRAND terms.   It appears that Continental\u2019s \u201crig ht to relief\u201d \ndepends on interpretation of contracts,  not patent law , because \u201cContinental\u2019s claims are all a \nfunction of Nokia\u2019s two contracts\u201d and this \u201crequire[s] the Court to interpret the effect of those two contracts[.]\u201d  (D.I. 10 at 2).   Therefore, because interpretation of Nokia\u2019s two agreements does 6 not require a patent law determination, this claim is properly made by a state, not a federal , court \nunder state law of contract  and the case must be remanded.2 \n2. The Existence of a Hypothetical Paten t Infringement Lawsuit Is \nInsufficient t o Establish Subject Matter Jurisdiction  in This Case.  \n \nNokia also contends that the existence of a hypothetical, threatened  lawsuit which could  \nbe brought against Continental for patent infringement satisf ies the req uirements for subject matter \njurisdiction.  ( See D.I. 9 at 7).  In declaratory judgment actions, \u201cthe court [will] examine the \ndeclaratory defendant \u2019s hypothetical well -pleaded compla int to determine if subject matter \njurisdiction exists.\u201d  ABB Inc. v. Coo per Indus.,  LLC, 635 F.3d 1345, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2011)  \n(emphasis in original) .  Although \u201ca specific threat of infringement litigation by the patentee is not \nrequired to establish jurisdiction ,\u201d id. at 1348 (quoting Hewlett -Packard Co. v. Acceleron LLC , \n587 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ), \u201ca substantial controversy [must exist] , between parties \nhav[ing]  adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a \ndeclaratory judgment .\u201d  MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc. , 549 U .S. 118, 127 (2007) (quoting \nMaryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941) ).   \nHere, Nokia  asserts that by referencing patent exhaustion Continental is revealing a fear \nthat Nokia  will bring a hypothetical suit for patent infri ngement .  (See D.I. 9 at 1).  But Nokia \u2019s \narguments  are conclusory at best .  Nokia  point s to no facts  in the record , or any prior statements \nmade by Continental  that suggest that Continental\u2019s true motive behind the reference to patent \nexhaustion in its  declaratory judgment claims is fear of patent infringement litigation from Nokia.  \n(D.I. 10 at 5).  Moreover, even if this Court were to agree with Nokia as to Continental \u2019s motives , \n \n2  The Court disagr ees that ExcelStor  is inapplicable, as Nokia argues, because \u201c[t]he patentee \nin ExcelStor . . . could not bring an infringement action because its prior patent \ninfringement suit was dismissed with prejudice  following settlement.\u201d  (D.I. 9 at 8) \n(emphasis in original) .   7 there is still a lack of sufficient immediacy and reality of such a patent i nfringement action to give \nrise to subject matter jurisdiction.  See SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 F.3d 1372, \n1380- 81 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stating that \u201cdeclaratory judgment jurisdiction generally will not arise \nmerely on the basis that a par ty learns of the existence of a pat ent owned by another or even \nperceives such a patent to pose a risk of infringement, without some affirmative act by the \npatentee.\u201d); see also Allied Min. Prod., Inc. v. Osmi, Inc., 870 F.3d 1337, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2017) \n(concluding that \u201c[d]eclaratory judgm ent jurisdiction requires some affirmative act by the \npatentee\u201d and threatening litigation against plaintiff\u2019s customers was not considered an affirmative \nact); see also ABB Inc. , 635 F.3d at 1349 (quoting MedImmune, Inc . v. Genentech , Inc., 549 U.S. \n118, 127 (2007))  (\u201cthere was a controversy \u2018of sufficient immediacy and reality\u2019 surrounding \ninfringement \u2018to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment .\u2019\u201d).  Nokia has not initiated, or \neven threatened, an infringement l awsuit against Continental .  To the contrary, Nokia has expressly \ndisavowed the possibility of such a lawsuit.  (D.I. 10 at 5).3   \nB. Continental  Is Not Entitled t o Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs  \n \nContinental requests attorney\u2019s fees and costs for improper removal under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1447(c) citing \u201cthe lack of merit in Nokia\u2019s decision to remove.\u201d  (D.I. 6 at 2).   Section 1447(c) \nprovides that \u201c[a]n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual \nexpenses, including attorney fees, incurr ed as a result of the removal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).  \nPayment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs is only appropriate if \u201cthe removing party lacked an \n \n3  In prior litigation with Continental arising out of the current FRAND licensing dispute, \nNokia successfully argued that Continental\u2019s declaratory judgment claim was not ripe \nbecause Nokia had not \u201cthreatened Continental with infringement litigation, an injunction \nproceeding, or other denial of access to patented technology.\u201d  Continental Automotive Systems, Inc., v. Avanci, LLC , et. al ., No. 19- 2933, D.I. 270- 1 at 1 (N.D. Tex. July 23, \n2019) . 8 objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.\u201d  Martin , 546 U.S. at  141; Branson v. Mestre , \n2017 WL 2615749, at *6 (D. Del. June 16, 2017) (quoting Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 \nU.S. 132, 141 (2005)) .  Here, however, t he Court cannot find that removal was objectively \nunreasonable  because Defendant\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction argument is  \u201cnot without a rguable \nsupport.\u201d  Soares v. Cont \u2019l Motors, Inc , 2020 WL 4437296, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 3, 2020).  \nTherefore, Continental\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs  is denied.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants  Nokia\u2019s  motion  to remand , but  denies the \nrequest for attorney\u2019s fees and costs .  An appropriate order will issue .
