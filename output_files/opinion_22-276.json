(\u201cInhibrx\u201d) and Brendan Eckelman \n(\u201cDr. Eckelman, and collectively with Inhibrx, \u201cDefendants\u201d).  Pending before the Court is \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss  the operative First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d), filed pursuant \nto the doctrine of forum non conveniens and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2) \nand 12(b)(6) (the \u201cmotion\u201d) .  (D.I. 61)  For the reasons set forth below, the Court will hold in \nabeyance the forum non conveniens portion of Defendants\u2019 motion  pending an evidentiary \nhearing, and the Court DENIES the remainder of Defendants\u2019 motion.    I. BACKGROUND   \nA. Factual Background \nI-Mab is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that was founded in 2016; it is  \nfocused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative molecules for treating diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.  (D.I. 49 at \u00b6 10)  I -Mab is a Cayman \nIslands corporation with its principal place of business in China.  ( Id. at \u00b6 2)   \nInhibrx is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in California.  ( Id. \nat \u00b6 3)  Dr. Eckelman is Inhibrx\u2019s Co-Founder, Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Vice President  of Corporate Strategy.  ( Id. at \u00b6 4)   \nI-Mab and Inhibrx are al leged to be competitors in the pre -clinical and clinical -stage \ndevelopment of bispecific antibody (\u201cBsAb\u201d) drugs.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 80)  Currently, both \ncompanies are developing treatments for cancer that share the same molecular targets.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n18-19)  For example, both I-Mab and Inhibrx are developing bispecific antibodies  designed to \n3 \n treat cancer that share the same pair of molecular targets (PD -L1 and 4- 1BB); I -Mab\u2019s molecule \nis TJ -L14B (\u201cL14B\u201d) and Inhibrx\u2019s molecule is INBRX -105.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 84)1 \n In 2018, I -Mab and Tracon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cTracon\u201d) , a contract research \norganization, entered into two agreements relating to United States clinical trials for I -Mab\u2019s \nTJD5 drug.  ( Id. at \u00b6 23)  I-Mab subsequently provided Tracon with access  to its trade secrets to \nenable Tracon to conduct clinical research pursuant to their collaboration.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 23- 24)  The \nrelationship eventually deteriorated, resulting in litigation in the Delaware Court of Chancery \n(\u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) , I-Mab v. TRA CON Pharms., Inc., C.A. No. 2021- 0176- PAF (the \n\u201cChancery Action\u201d) and arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce  (\u201cICC\u201d) .  (Id. at \u00b6 \n25; see also D.I. 6 2, ex. A at 1)  I-Mab and Tracon submitted a Stipulation and Proposed Order \nGoverning the Production and Exchange of Confidential and Highly Confidential Information (the \u201cConfidentiality Order\u201d) in the Chancery Action, which the  Court of  Chancery subsequently \nso ordered.  (D.I. 6 2, ex. A)\n2  The Confidentiality Order also governs the arbitration proceeding.  \n(D.I. 49 at \u00b6  25)  The Confidentiality Order permits I -Mab and Tracon to supply confidential \ndiscovery material to experts and consultants, provided that such expert or consultant \u201cis not \ncurrently an employee of . . . any competitor . . . of [I -Mab or Tracon], as far as the expert or \nconsultant can reasonably determine.\u201d  (Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) ; D.I. 6 2, ex. A at \u00b6  \n \n1  Prior to  I-Mab\u2019s  development  of L14B, I -Mab and Inhibrx considered  becoming \npartners  to collaborate on  Inhibrx\u2019s  INBRX -105 molecule,  but ultimately  decided  against  joining \nforces.   (D.I.  49 at \u00b6 82) \n \n2  The Confidentiality  Order,  which  Defendants  attached  as an exhibit  to their  \nopening brief,  is cited  in this opinion, as  it is integral  to the FAC  and referenced  therein.   See In \nre Burlington Coat  Factory  Secs.  Litig. , 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d  Cir. 1997).   Moreover, in  \nconsidering a  motion  to dismiss  based  on forum  non conveniens  grounds, a  court  may  consider  \nmatters  outside  the pleadings.  See,  e.g., Usme  v. CMI Leisure  Mgmt., Inc. , Case No.:  21-21191-\nCIV-GAYLES,  2022 WL  910336, at  *3 (S.D.  Fla. Mar.  29, 2022) . 4 \n 8)  The Confidentiality Order furthe r emphasizes that \u201c[u]nder no circumstances shall an expert \nor consultant who is a competitor or an employee of a competitor of  a Party . . . be provided \naccess\u201d to confidential discovery material.  (D.I. 6 2, ex. A at \u00b6  8)  And it defines \u201c [c]ompetitor\u201d \nas \u201ca person or entity endeavoring to engage in the same or similar line of business, provide the \nsame or similar services, sell the same or similar products, and/or operate in the same markets, as \nwell as any person or entity who are actually engaged in any of these activities.\u201d  ( Id.)   \n Unbeknownst to I -Mab, Dr. Eckelman agreed to serve as a testifying expert for Tracon in \nthe arbitration.  (D.I. 49 at \u00b6 \u00b6 26, 32 )  In conjunction with being retained as an expert, Dr. \nEckelman executed an Agreement to be bound by the Confidentiality Order (the \u201cUndertaking\u201d).  \n(Id. at \u00b6 27; D.I. 6 2, ex. B )3   \n In December 2021, Tracon served Dr. Eckelman\u2019s expert report.  ( D.I. 49 at \u00b6 32)  The \nreport states that Dr. Eckelman reviewed multiple documents that contain I -Mab\u2019s proprietary \nand confidential information.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 98 -105)  Upon discovering that Dr. Eckelman was \nTracon\u2019s expert, I -Mab informed Tracon that Dr. Eckelman was employed by a direct competitor \nof I-Mab and requested that Tracon identify all I -Mab confidential information that Tracon \nprovided to Dr. Eckelman.  ( Id. at \u00b6 32)  I-Mab alleges that Tracon was not cooperative  in \nresponding to this request .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36 ) \n \n  (\nId. at \u00b6 34)  \n \n \n \n \n \n3  The Undertaking, which  Defendants  attached  as an exhibit  to their opening brief,  \nis cited  herein ; it too is integral  to the FAC  and referenced  therein.    \n5 \n  \n   (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 44, 81 (internal quotation marks omitted) )  On April \n22, 2022, \n \n  \n(\nId. at \n\u00b6\u00b6 45 \n, 106 \n)  In addition to the documents listed in the Index, Tracon \nrepresented that it also provided Dr. Eckelman with access to the \n \n  \n(\nId. \nat \n\u00b6 153; \nsee also id. \n \nat \n\u00b6 \n48) \n I- M\nab alleges that \n when he signed the Undertaking, \n Dr. Eckelman knew that he was \nemployed by a \n direct competitor of I\n-Mab and was thus prohibited from reviewing I- Mab\u2019s \nconfidential information .  Nevertheless , I-Mab alleges, Dr. Eckelman  \nintentionall\n y \nmisrepresented to the parties to the arbitration that he was an independent expert, even though he \nhad a central role at Inhibrx (I- Mab\u2019s direct competitor )\u2014and that he did so \n all \n in order to learn \nI-Mab\u2019s trade secret information.  ( Id. \nat \n \u00b6\u00b6\n  94-\n96)  It \nis alleged that \n Dr. Eckelman continues to \nwork as Inhibrx\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer\n , (\nid. \nat \n\u00b6 172), and that he continues to work on \nbispecific antibodies at Inhibrx that compete with \n I-\nMab\u2019s antibodies , (id.\n \nat \n \u00b6 173). \nAdditional relevant factual allegations will be discussed below in the appropriate portions \nof Section II. \nB. Procedural History  \n I- Mab \nfiled this action on \n March 1, 2022.  (D.I. 2\n )  \nOn May 12, 2022, I-Mab filed the \noperative FAC.  \n(D.I. \n 49\n)  On \n May 25, 2022, Defendants filed the instant motion, (D.I. 61\n), \nwhich was fully briefed as of June 15, 2022, (D.I. 7\n 6).\n  On July 7, 2022, \n the parti\nes filed a joint \nnotice of consent to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to conduct all proceedings in this case, including \ntrial, the entry of final judgment and all post-trial proceedings.  (D.I. 89)   \n6 \n II. DISCUSSION  \n I-Mab\u2019s FAC contains two causes of action , both for trade secret misappropriation \nagainst both Defendants :  Count I, which alleges a violation of the federal Defend Trade Secrets \nAct (\u201cDTSA\u201d) , and Count II, which alleges a violation of the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets \nAct (\u201cDUTSA\u201d) .  (D.I . 49 at \u00b6\u00b6 175 -201)  Defendants\u2019 motion presents three attacks with respect \nto I-Mab\u2019s claims:  (1)  I-Mab\u2019s claims must be brought in the Court of Chancery; (2) Dr. \nEckelman is not subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court; and (3) I -Mab has failed to  \nproperly plead its claims.  T he Court will address the se challenges in turn below. \nA. Forum Non Conveniens /Forum -selection Clause \nDefendants first argue that the claims should be dismissed  because, pursuant to the \nforum -selection clause of the Confidentiality Order, this action must be brought in th e Court of \nChancery.  (D.I. 62 at 6 -10)  That clause provides that, inter alia : \nEach of the parties and other persons receiving Discovery Material \npursuant to this Stipulation (a) irrevocably submits to the personal \njurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the state of Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken from such courts, in any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Stipulation, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such suit, action, or proceeding shall be brought, heard, and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery (provided that, in the event that subject matter \njurisdic tion is unavailable in that court, then all such claims shall \nbe brought, heard, and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court sitting in the state of Delaware)  . . . (d) agrees not to \nbring any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Stipulation in any other court, and ( e) expressly waives, and \nagrees not to plead or to make, any claim that any such suit, action, or proceeding is subject (in whole or in part) to a jury trial. \n (Id., ex. A at \u00b6 30)    \n\u201c[T]he appropriate way to enforce a forum -selection clause pointing to a state or foreign \nforum is through the doctrine of forum non conveniens .\u201d  Atl. Marine Const. Co. v. U.S. Distr. 7 \n Ct. for W. Dist. of Texas , 571 U.S. 49, 60 (2013); see also AGB Contemporary A.G. v. Artemundi \nLLC, CIVIL ACTION NO. 20 -1689, 2021 WL 1929356, at *7 (D. Del. May 13, 2021) .  Before \nengaging in the forum non conveniens  analysis, a  Court must consider whether the forum -\nselection clause:  (1) is enforceable; and (2) applies to the claim(s) at issue.   AGB Contemporary , \n2021 WL 1929356, at *7.  Thereafter, a court should consider a number of factors  when \nassessing the doctrine of forum non conveniens ; certain of these factors are not applicable if the \nforum -selection cl ause is enforceable and applies to the claims at issue .  Id. at *9.4 \nIn its briefing, I-Mab does not address whether the forum -selection clause is enforceable \ngenerally or applies to the claims at issue , nor does it address the forum non conveniens  factors .  \n(D.I. 69 at 11- 14; see also D.I. 76 at 1 (\u201cI -Mab does not dispute that the forum[ -]selection clause \nis enforceable, that the asserted claims fall within it, or that the forum non conveniens factors \nfavor dismissal.  Instead, I -Mab argues that Dr . Eckelman cannot enforce it.\u201d))  Instead, I -Mab\u2019s \nprimary argument is that Defendants lack standing to enforce the forum -selection clause.  (D.I. \n69 at 11- 14)   \nIn addressing this lack -of-standing argument, the Court will focus on Dr. Eckelman.  This \nis because in reply, Defendants only argue that Dr. Eck elman  can enforce the forum -selection \nclause\u2014and thus , they do not appear to contest that Inhibrx (an entity that was not a party to the \n \n4  More  specifically,  the forum  non conveniens  analysis  generally  considers  four \nfactors:   \u201c(1) the  amount  of deference to  be afforded  to plaintiffs\u2019  choice  of forum;  (2) the  \navailability  of an adequate alternative  forum  where  defendants  are amenable to  process  and \nplaintiffs\u2019  claims  are cognizable;  (3) relevant  \u2018private  interest\u2019  factors  affecting  the convenience \nof the litigants; and  (4) relevant  \u2018public  interest\u2019  factors  affecting  the convenience  of the forum.\u201d   \nCollins  on Behalf  of Herself  v. Mary  Kay,  Inc., 874 F.3d 176, 186 (3d  Cir. 2017)  (citations  \nomitted).   However,  if an enforceable forum -selection clause exists  that applies  to the claim(s)  at \nissue,  the first and third  factors  are not  afforded  any weight.  Id.   In such  circumstances,  courts  \nshould accordingly only consider  the second and  fourth factors,  and these should overcome  a \nforum -selecti on clause in  only the  most  \u201c\u2018unusual\u2019\u201d  and \u201c\u2018extraordinary\u2019\u201d circumstances.   Id. \n(quoting Atl.  Marine , 571 U.S.  at 62, 64). 8 \n Chancery Action, and that did not execute any document that relates in any way to the \nConfidentiality Order) cannot enforce the forum -selection clause.  (D.I. 76 at 1 (\u201cDr. Eckelman \ncan Enforce the Forum Selection Clause.\u201d) (emphasis omitted) )   \nA forum -selection clause can generally be enforced by a person or entity that is  a party to \nthe agreement that includes such a clause.  See  Baker v. Impact Holding, Inc., Civil Action No. \n4960- VCP, 2010 WL 1931032, at *3 (Del. Ch. May 13, 2010);  see also Wildfire  Prods., L.P.  v. \nTeam  Lemieux LLC , C.A. No. 2021- 1072- PAF, 2022 WL 2342335, at *9 (Del. Ch. June 29, \n2022)  (\u201cAs a general rule, only the formal parties to a contract are bound by its terms.\u201d) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).5  Additionally, under Delaware law, a non -party  may \nenforc e a forum -selection clause i f the non- party  is a third party beneficiary of the relevant \nagreement.  See Bonanno v. VTB Holdings, Inc. C.A. No. 10681- VCN, 2016 WL 614412, at *7 \n(Del. Ch. Feb. 8, 2016).6   \n \n5  The parties did not explicitly address whether state or federal law applies to \nDefendants\u2019 forum non conveniens -related arguments .  In their briefs, both sides cite to cases \nfrom the federal courts as well as from Delaware state courts in support of their positions.  ( D.I. \n69 at 11- 12; D.I. 76 at 2- 3)  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has \nexplained that a court should utilize state law in assessing this issue (unless the parties have \nagreed otherwise).  In re McGraw -Hill Global Educ. Holdings LLC , 909 F.3d 48, 58- 59 (3d Cir. \n2018) (\u201cOur case law directs us to use state law to determine the scope of a forum sel ection \nclause\u2014that is, whether the claims and parties involved in the suit are subject to the clause.\u201d) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Thus, the Court will apply Delaware law (as it \nhas been applied by both Delaware state courts and federal courts) to this issue, just as the parties \noften do in their briefing.    \n \n6 Under Delaware law, a non -party  may also enforce a forum selection clause if the \nnon-party  is \u201cclosely related to one of the signatories such that the non- party\u2019s enforcement of \nthe clause is foreseeable by virtue of the relationship between the signatory and the party sought \nto be bound.\u201d  Mack v. Rev. Worldwide, Inc., C.A. No. 2019- 0123- MTZ, 2020 WL 7774604, at \n*17 n.135 (Del. Ch. Dec. 30, 2020) ( quoting Ashall Homes Ltd. v. ROK Entm\u2019t Grp. Inc., 992 \nA.2d 1239, 1249 (Del. Ch. 2010)).  A non- signatory is considered to be \u201cclosely related\u201d \nprovided that:  (1) the party receives a direct benefit from  the agreement; or (2) it was \nforeseeable that the party would be bound by the agreement.  Id.   However, Defendants do not 9 \n In addressing the dispute over whether Dr. Eckelman has standing to enforce the forum -\nselection clause here,  the parties raise two distinct issues.  First, they dispute whether Dr. \nEckelman was a party to the  Confidentiality Order .  And second, if he was not, they disagree \nover whether he was an intended third- party beneficiary of  the Confidentiality Order .  (D.I. 69 at \n13-14; D.I. 76 at 2- 4)   \nFor the Court, however, t he difficulty here is that the answer to both of these key \nquestions  appears to turn on the resolution of a disputed factual issue :  that is, whether Dr. \nEckelman was employed by a competitor of I -Mab at the time he signed the Undertaking.   \nFor example, although Dr. Eckelman was not a signatory to the Confidentiality Order \nwhen it was submitted by agreement to the T ribunal on March 31, 2021, in some circumstances, \na person who subsequently signs a joinder to an agreement ( like Dr. Eckelman  did when he \nsigned the Undertaking here) could be considered to be a party to the underlying agree ment.  See \nAlixPartners, LLP v. Mori , C.A. No. 2019- 0392- KSJM, 2019 WL 6327325, at *11 (Del. Ch. \nNov. 26, 2019) (\u201cIndividuals often become parties to agreements by signing joinders to those \nagreements . . . .  This Court declines to hold that forum[ -]selection clauses in every such \nagreement are categorically invalid and unenforceable for want of free negotiation\u201d); see also Capital Grp. Cos., Inc. v. Armour , No. Civ.A. 422- N, 2004 WL 2521295, at *2- 3 (Del. Ch. Oct. \n29, 2004) (considering trustees\u2019 execution of a joinder agreement by which they agreed to be bound by a stock restriction agreement, and finding that the forum -selection clause in the stock \nrestriction agreement was valid).  That said, pursuant to Delaware law, a valid contract requires proof tha t the parties mutually assented to all essential terms.  See Green v. Wi sneski , C.A. No. \n \nrely on the \u201c closely related \u201d test in arguing that Dr. Eckelman has standing to enforce the forum -\nselection clause.  (D.I. 76 at 1- 4)    10 \n 11817- MM, 2021 WL 4999348, at *2 (Del. Ch. Oct. 15, 2021).  And here, I-Mab is arguing that \nbecause the Confidentiality Order was only ever intended to apply to expert s who were not \ncompetitors of I-Mab, then I-Mab certainly did not intend to enter into an agreement with Dr. \nEckelman \u2014because Dr. Eckelman was in fact  employed by a competitor of I -Mab at the \nrelevant time .  (D.I. 69 at 13)   \nSimilarly, the question of whether a non -signatory qualifies as a third party beneficiary to \na contract  hinges on whether \u201cthe contract was made for the benefit of that third party within the \nintent and contemplation of the contracting parties.\u201d  Hadley v.  Shaffer , No. Civ.A. 99- 144-JJF, \n2003 WL 21960406, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 12, 2003)  (also noting that to determine whether the \nparties intended to make an individual a third party beneficiary, a court must look to the terms of \nthe contract and the surrounding circumstances) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) .  \nAnd here again, I-Mab\u2019s  whole argument is that \u201c [it] and Tracon specifically intended to exclude \ncompetitors like Dr. Eckelman\u201d from being experts who  would gain  access to confidential \ninformation under the Confidentiality Order.  (D.I. 69 at 13)   \nAnd yet the issue of whether Dr. Eckelman wa s (and is) , in fact, employed by a \ncompetitor of I -Mab is  still a hotly disputed question in this case .  In the FAC, I -Mab certainly \nalleges that he was (and is ).  (See, e.g., D.I. 49 at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 90)   But Defendants claim that Dr. \nEckelman was (and is) not  employed by a competitor.  ( D.I. 72 at 2 (\u201cBut whether Dr . Eckelman \nwas a \u2018competitor\u2019 is the key disputed issue in this case.\u201d) ; id. at 5 ; see also D.I. 62 at 17)    \nThis raises  a question that  the parties  did not  address  in detail  in their  briefing, but  that in \nthe Court\u2019s  view,  is very  important  here.   That  is, what  rule\u2014and  more  importantly,  what  \nprocedure s\u2014should the  Court  use to resolve  the parties\u2019  key factual  dispute  in deciding this  \nforum  non conveniens /forum -selection  clause issue?    11 \n In their  briefing  (in a footnote ), Defendants  say that Rule  12(b)(1)  applies  to the forum  \nnon conveniens  aspect  of their  motion.  (D.I.  62 at 7 n.4)   I-Mab does  not seem  to disagree .   \nThe Court  note s, however, that  it is not exactly  clear  under  the law which  (if any)  of the \nFederal  Rules  of Civil Procedure  apply to  a forum  non conveniens  analysis .  See, e.g., Whirlpool  \nCorp. v.  Cabri , Civil Action  No. 21-cv-00979EJW, 2022 WL  1421126, at  *5 n.8 (D.  Del.  May  5, \n2022) ; Monroe  Staffing  Servs ., LLC  v. Whitaker , 20-CV-1716 (GBD)  (BCM),  2022 WL  684714, \nat *5 n.3 (S.D.N.Y.  Mar.  7, 2022) ; Lee v.  Dubose  Nat\u2019l  Energy  Servs.,  Inc., CIVIL  ACTION \nNO. 18-2504, 2019 WL  1897164, at  *1 (E.D.Pa. Apr. 29, 2019) ; Prod . Res . Grp., L.L.C. v.  \nMartin  Prof \u2019l, A/S , 907 F.  Supp. 2d 401, 406- 07 (S.D.N.Y.  2012).  What  does  seem  clear,  \nhowever, is  that when  it comes  to resolving a  motion  to dismiss  relating  to the doctrine  of forum  \nnon conveniens , while  the court  may  rely on the  pleadings  and affidavits  filed  in connection with  \nthe motion, if  a material  dispute  of fact exists  between  the parties \u2014and  if resolution of  that \ndispute  would turn  the tide one way  or the other  with respect  to whether  a forum -selection  clause \napplies \u2014then  the Court  cannot  resolve  such  a fact in the movant\u2019s  favor  without  holding an  \nevidentiary  hearing.  See,  e.g., Knowyourmeme.com  Network  v. Nizri , 20-CV-9869 ( GBD)  (JLC), \n2021 WL  3855490, at  *6 (S.D.N.Y.  Aug. 30, 2021) ; AMA  Multimedia  LLC  v. Sagan Ltd., No.  \nCV-16-01269- PHX- DGC,  2020 WL  4284364, at  *2 n.3 (D.  Ariz.  July 27, 2020) ; T & M Solar  & \nAir Conditioning, Inc.  v. Lennox  Int\u2019l Inc., 83 F. Supp. 3d 855, 870\u201371 (N.D.  Cal. 2015) ; Allianz  \nGlob. Corp. &  Specialty  v. Chiswick  Bridge , Nos.  13-cv-7559- RA, 13-cv-7565- RA, 2014 WL  \n6469027, at  *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2014) .  This makes  sense,  as it would seem  neither  fair nor \nlegally  correct  to resolve  this key issue  about  competitor  status  (which  would , in turn, likely  \ndecide the  forum  non conveniens /forum -selection  clause dispute  with  finality)  by simply  12 \n accepting  I-Mab\u2019s allegations  (i.e., that  Dr. Eckelman  was and is a competitor ) as true\u2014when  \nthose  allegations  are actually  hotly disputed.7   \nFor these reasons,  the Court  concludes  that it must  hold an  evidentiary  hearing, as  only \nafter appropriately resolving this  key dispute  about  competitor  status  can the Court  decide this  \nportion of  Defendants\u2019  motion.  Accordingly, by no later  than  10 days  from  the date of  this \nOpinion, the  parties  shall  provide  the Court  with  a joint  status  report  of no longer  than  three  \nsingle -spaced  pages  that sets out the parties\u2019  position(s)  regarding when  the hearing  should be  \nheld and what  steps,  if any,  need  to be taken  leading  up to  the hearing.8 \nB. Personal Jurisdiction  \n \n7  The Court  recognizes  that this key disputed \u201ccompetition\u201d  issue  also seems  to lie \nat the heart  of the merits  dispute  in this case (in  that I-Mab claims  that Dr. Eckelman  knowingly \nmisrepresented  his status  as I-Mab\u2019s  competitor  in order  to gain  access  to its trade secrets).   Even  \nso, courts  have  noted that  sometimes  they  may  have to  make conclusions  regarding an  issue  \nrelevant  to the merits  when  they  are r esolving threshold issues in  a case.  Cf.  Spring Pharms., \nLLC v. Retrophin, Inc. , CIVIL  ACTION  NO.  18-4553, 2019 WL  6769988, at *2 (E.D.  Pa. Dec.  \n11, 2019)  (noting that,  in the Rule  12(b)(1)  subject  matter  jurisdiction  context, \u201c if there are \ndisputes  of material  facts,  [c]ourts  in this jurisdiction  must  permit the  case to  proceed  to a \nplenary  trial on the  contested  issues so  that it may  resolve  the question of  its jurisdiction  even  \nwhile  hearing  proofs  that are equally  pertinent  to the merits\u201d ) (internal  quotation marks  and \ncitatio n omitted).    \n \n8  The parties also addressed a related issue raised by I -Mab\u2014that in  agreeing to the \nterms of the Confidentiality Order, I-Mab did not waive its constitutional right to a jury trial \n(which it could not obtain in the Court of Chancery) with respect to trade secret misappropriation \nclaims against a direct competitor.  (D.I. 69 at 2, 9 -11)  A litigant may waive its constitutional \nright to a jury trial in a civil case.  Miller v. Sun Capital Partners, Inc., Civil Action No. 13-\n1996- RGA, 2016 WL 4941989, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. 15, 2016).  However, because \u201cthe right of \n[a] jury trial is fundamental, courts indulge every reasonable presum ption against waiver.\u201d  \nAetna Ins. Co. v. Kennedy to Use of Bogash, 301 U.S. 389, 393 (1937).  To be enforceable, a jury waiver must be made knowingly and voluntarily based on the facts of the case.  Miller , 2016 WL \n4941989, at *5.  In the Court\u2019s view, this issue is largely  subsumed by the standing issue \ndiscussed above , because it turns on the question of whether Dr. Eckelman is a proper party to \nthe Confidentiality Order.  If so, then it would seem to be clear that I -Mab has agreed to proceed \nwith its claims in the Court of Chancery with no jury trial.  (D.I. 62, ex. A at \u00b6 30)    13 \n Defendants also contend that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Dr. Eckelman as \nan additional reason why I -Mab\u2019s claims must be dismissed.  (D.I. 62 at 10 -12; D.I. 76 at 5- 7)  \nDr. Eckelman is a resident of California.  (D.I. 25 at \u00b6  2)  He does not have a residence in \nDelaware, and his testimony in the arbitration took place in Washington D.C.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 6- 7)   \nRule 12(b)(2) directs courts to dismiss a case when the  court lacks p ersonal jurisdiction \nover the defendant.9  When a defendant moves to dismiss a lawsuit for lack of personal \njurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing the basis for jurisdiction.  Power \nIntegrations, Inc. v. BCD Semiconductor Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 365, 369 (D. Del. 2008).  In a \ncase like this one, where a district court has not held an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff must simply make out a  prima facie  showing that  personal jurisdiction exists.   See Perlight Solar  Co., \nLtd. v. Perlight Sales N. Am. LL , C.A. No. 14- 331-LPS, 2015 WL 5544966, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. \n18, 2015).  All factual inferences to be drawn from the pleadings, affidavits and exhibits must be drawn in the plaintiff's favor at this stage.   Power Integrations , 547 F. Supp. 2d at 369. \nI-Mab\u2019s makes two arguments as to why it has made a prima facie  showing that personal \njurisdiction exists, but the Court need consider only one of those here.  That is I -Mab\u2019s argument \nthat Delaware\u2019s officer consent statute, Del. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 3114(b), confers personal jurisdiction \nover Dr. Eckelman.  (D.I. 69 at 7- 8)  That statute provides that Delaware courts may \n \n9  Typically, in  determining  whether  it can  exercise personal  jurisdiction  over  a \ndefendant, a court  employs  a two-part test:  (1) it analyzes  the long -arm statue  of the state  in \nwhich  it is located;  and (2) it determines  whether  exercising  jurisdiction  over  the defendant  \nwould comport  with  the Due  Process  Clause of  the U.S.  Constitution.  Perlight  Solar  Co., Ltd.  v. \nPerlight  Sales  N. Am. LL, C.A.  No. 14-331-LPS,  2015 WL  5544966, at  *2 (D. Del.  Sept.  18, \n2015).  That  said,  when  a party  is bound by a  forum  selection  clause,  it is deemed  to have \nconsented  to personal  jurisdiction  in the chosen  forum  through agreement  to the inclusion of  the \nclause in  the contract  at issue.   See Hardw ire, LLC  v. Zero  Int\u2019l,  Inc., Civil Action  No. 14-54-\nLPS-CJB,  2014 WL  5144610, at  *6 (D.  Del.  Oct.  14, 2014).  In such  a case,  a minimum contacts  \nanalysis  pursuant  to the Delaware long- arm statute  and the Due  Process  Clause is  not required.  \nId. 14 \n exercise personal  jurisdiction  over nonresident officers of a corporation in \u201call civil actions or \nproceedings brought in this State, by or on behalf of, or against such corporation, in which such \nofficer is a necessary or proper party [.].\u201d  Del. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 3114(b).  The Supreme Court of \nDelaware h as explained that the officer consent statute \u201conly applies when a director or officer \nfaces claims that arise out of his exercise of corporate powers\u201d and where the director \u201chas a \nlegal interest in the dispute that is separate from [the corporation\u2019s] in terest.\u201d  Hazout v. Tsang \nMun Ting, 134 A.3d 274, 278- 79 (Del. 2016).  According to I -Mab, Dr. Eckelman is a proper \nparty here because:  (1) he is independently liable for his conduct ; (2) I-Mab\u2019s claims against \nhim arise out of the same facts and occurren ces as the claims against Inhibrx ; and (3) he engaged \nin continued acts of misappropriation in his official role as Inhibrx\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer .  \n(D.I. 69 at 7- 8)    \nThe parties seem to agree that this issue  turns on whether I-Mab has sufficiently \ndemonstrated that Dr. Eckelman was working in his official capacity as a corporate officer of Inhibrx when he committed the alleged acts of misappropriation.  (D.I. 69 at 8; D.I. 76 at 6 \n(Defendants arguing that I -Mab\u2019s officer consent st atute argument fails \u201cbecause Dr. Eckelman \nserved as [an] expert in his personal  capacity and the claims in the FAC do not implicate his role \nas an officer of Inhibrx.\u201d)); see also, e.g., Hazout , 134 A.3d at 278 ( finding that the officer \nconsent statute ap plied where the individual had a legal interest in the dispute that was separate \nfrom the corporation\u2019s interest , and where all of the claims against the individual arose out of \nactions taken in his official corporate capacity).  As discussed below in Sect ion II .C.2, the Court \nfinds that I -Mab has sufficiently pleaded that Dr. Eckelman engaged in continued acts of \nmisappropriation in his official capacity , in order to benefit Inhibrx.  (D.I. 49 at \u00b6\u00b6 95, 172- 74)  \nAnd so I -Mab has made out a prima facie  case of  a statutory claim to personal jurisdiction here.  15 \n Additionally, the Court concludes that I -Mab has also made out a prima facie  case that \nDr. Eckelman has minimum contacts with the State of Delaware that satisfy the Due Process \nclause.  See H azout , 134 A.3d at 291 (noting that the way to police the concern that applying the \nofficer consent statute would compromise a non- resident f iduciary\u2019s due process rights is to \napply the statute\u2019s terms and then to utilize a Due Process/ minimum contacts analysis to ensure \nthat the statute is not  used in a situationally inappropriate manner); see also Turf Nation, Inc. v. \nUBU Sports, Inc., C.A. No.: N17C -01-271- EMD CCLD, 2017 WL 4535970, at *9 (Del. Super. \nCt. Oct. 11, 2017) .  Here, Dr. Eckelman voluntarily participated as an expert in an arbitration \nproceeding that arose out of a case in the Court of Chancery of  the State of Delaware.  In doing \nso, he signed an Undertaking ( a document associated with the Chancery Action) that indicated he \nagreed to be  bound by the Confidentiality Order  (another document associated with the Chancery \nAction) .  And the Confidentiality Order provides that suc h a signatory submits to the personal \njurisdiction of any court in Delaware  as to any suit arising out of or relating  to that Order .  (D.I. \n62, ex. A at \u00b6 30)  The minimum contacts analysis is solely about whether a party, via his own \nconduct, has purposel y created a s ufficiently s ubstantial connection with the forum state, such \nthat he should have foreseen that he could be later haled into the courts of that  State.  See Asahi \nMetal Indus. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Ca l., Solano Cnty ., 480 U.S. 102, 108- 09 (1987).  Regardless \nof whether Dr. Eckelman should have signed on as an expert  witness  (i.e., whether he did so \nwhile being employed by a competitor to I -Mab), the fact that he actually did do so \u2014and that \nthis case arises out of and relates to that conduct \u2014is enough to support a t least a  prima facie  \nshowing that Dr. Eckelman  has sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Delaware.  Cf. \nGolden v. Stein, 481 F. Supp. 3d 843, 857- 58 (S.D. Iowa 2019) .   \nFor these reasons, the Court denies Defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(2) motion.  16 \n C. Failure to State a Claim  \nDefendants also argue that in the FAC, I-Mab fails to state a claim  as to its causes of \naction , such that those claims should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) .  (D.I. 62 at 12-20; \nD.I. 76 at 7- 10)   \nThe sufficiency of pleadings for non- fraud claims is governed by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 8, which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief[.]\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  A claim alleging frau d or mistake, however, is \nsubject to the more stringent pleading requirements of  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), \nwhich mandates that the \u201ccircumstances constituting fraud or mistake\u201d be \u201cstate[d] with \nparticularity[.]\u201d   Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b);  see also Frederico  v. Home  Depot , 507 F.3d 188, 200 (3d \nCir. 2007).10  \nWhen presented with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a \ncourt conducts a two -part analysis.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. \n2009).  First , the court separates the factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the \n \n10  As noted above, I-Mab\u2019s trade secret misappropriation claims are based on Dr. \nEckelman\u2019s alleged intentional misrepresentations in executing the Undertaking, despite \nallegedly knowing that he was  an employee of  I-Mab\u2019s competitor .  (D.I. 49 at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 94- 96; see \nalso D.I. 62 at 13; D.I. 69 at 15- 16)  The parties dispute whether I-Mab\u2019s claims are subject to \nthe higher pleading standard se t out in Rule 9(b).  (D.I. 62 at 13; D.I. 69 at 15)  None of the \nCourt\u2019s conclusions below (i.e., that the FAC plausibly alleges claims against both Defendants) \nnecessarily turns on the answer to this dispute , as the allegations would be sufficient under R ule \n8 or Rule 9(b) .  Nevertheless, the Court notes that if a claim is  actually  pleaded  in a manner that \n\u201csounds in fraud[,]\u201d \u2014as  I -Mab\u2019s claims are here \u2014then the claim has to meet  Rule  9(b)\u2019s \nrequirements .  Cf. Registered  Agent  Sols., Inc.  v. Corp. Serv.  Co., No. 1:21- cv-786-SB, 2022 WL \n911253, at *2 (D. Del.

Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 679 (2009)).  In assessing the plausibility of a claim, the court must \u201cconstrue the \ncomplaint in the light most favora ble to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any \nreasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d  Id.  at 210 (quoting \nPhillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008)).  \nPursuant to Delaware law, there ar e four elements to a claim for mi sappropriation of \ntrade secrets:  ( 1) a trade secret exists ;11 (2) the trade secret was communicated to the defendant ; \n(3) the communication was made pursuant to an express or implied understanding that the \nsecrecy of the information  would be maintained; and ( 4) the trade secret has been \nmisappropriated within the meaning of that term as defined in the DUTSA.   Alarm.com \nHoldings, Inc. v. ABS Cap. Partners Inc., C.A. No. 2017- 0583- JTL, 2018 WL 3006118, at *6- 7 \n(Del. Ch. June 15, 2018) ; Wayman Fire Prot., Inc. v. Premium Fire & Sec., LLC , C.A. No. 7866-\nVCP, 2014 WL 897223, at *13 (Del. Ch. Mar. 5, 2014) .  Similarly, to establish a violation of the \nDTSA, I -Mab must plead and prove:  \u201c(1) the existence of a trade secret, defined gener ally as \ninformation with independent economic value that the owner has taken reasonable measures to \nkeep secret [;] (2) that is related to a product or service used in, or intended for use in, interstate \nor foreign commerce [,] and (3) the misappropriation of that trade secret[.]\u201d   Oakwood Lab\u2019 ys \n \n11  Under the DUTSA,  a \u201ctrade secret\u201d is  defined as  \u201cinformation, including a  \nformula,  pattern,  compilation,  program, device,  method, technique  or process,  that: . . .

Bo th the DUTSA and DTSA each provide that one way that a person can \nmisappropriate a trade secret is by acquiring it  while knowing that it was acquired through \nimproper means.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839(5)(A); Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(2)(a).  \n\u201cImproper  means ,\u201d under both statutes, \u201cinclude [s] theft, bribery, misrepresentation , breach or \ninducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other \nmeans.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839(6); Del. C ode Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(1) .  Here, I-Mab is alleging that \nDefendants acquired its  trade secrets through misrepresentations .  (See D.I. 69 at 15- 16)   \nDefendants assert three reasons why I -Mab\u2019s claims are insufficiently pleaded.  The \nCourt will take them up in turn.   \n 1. Allegations Regard ing \u201cImproper Means\u201d as to Dr. Eckelman  \nFirst, Defendants argue that the FAC fail s to sufficiently allege Dr. Eckelman\u2019s state of \nmind .  (D.I. 62 at 15- 18; D.I. 76 at 8- 9)  Defendants\u2019 primary argument here is that the FAC does \nnot sufficiently plead that when Dr. Eckelman signed the Undertaking, he actually knew  that he \nand Inhibrx were competitors of I -Mab (i.e., the substance of the misrepresentation that is said to \namount  to Dr. Eckelman\u2019s use of improper means to acquire the trade secrets at issue).  ( Id.)12  \nThe Court disagrees.  The FAC not only alleges that I -Mab and Inhibrx were competitors \nat the relevant time, but it also sets out facts that plausibly assert that Dr . Eckelman was aware of \nthis competitive status.  To that end, the FAC asserts that:  (1) at all relevant times, D r. Eckelman  \n \n12  Defendants  additionally  argue  that I-Mab\u2019s  allegations  should fail  because I-Mab \n\u201cdoes  not even  assert  that Dr. Eckelman  made the  alleged  misrepresentations  in an attempt to  \nobtain I -Mab\u2019s  trade secrets.\u201d  (D.I.  62 at 16; see also  D.I. 76 at 8)  But  even  assuming such  an \nallegation  were required, the FAC  does  assert  as much.  (D.I.  49 at \u00b6 96 (\u201cDr.  Eckelman  \nmisrepresented  to the parties  in the [Confidentiality  Order]  that he is independent, even  though \nhe is an employee  of a direct  competitor,  to learn  . . .

A at \u00b6  8)  While I -Mab\u2019s allegations are just that \u2014only allegations \u2014for \nnow they are sufficient to plausibly claim that Dr. Eckelman knew about I -Mab and Inhibrx\u2019s \nstatus as competitors, and thus had the requisite state of mind to have used improper means to \nobtain trade secrets.  \nThus, the Court concludes that this argument is not a basis for dismissal.  2. Claims Against Inhibrx  \nDefend ants next argue that the FAC does not plead sufficient claims against Inhibrx.  \n(D.I. 62 at 14- 15; D.I. 76 at 7- 8)  As was noted above, one way for I -Mab t o prevail on its trade \nsecret claims against Inhibrx  is to allege that Inhibrx had knowledge that I-Mab\u2019s trade secrets \nwere acquired by improper means.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839(5)(A); Del. C ode Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(2)(a) .  \nThe FAC\u2019s relevant allegations with respect to Inhibrx regarding this element are as follows:  \n29.  Given Dr. Eckelman\u2019s central roles as the Co -Founder, Chief \nScientific Officer, and Executive VP of Corporate Strategy at \nInhibrx, Dr. Eckelman\u2019s knowledge cannot be separated from \nInhibrx\u2019s knowledge .  20 \n 30.  On information and belief, Inhibrx became aware  of Dr. \nEckelman\u2019s engagement as an expert  for Tracon, that Dr. \nEckelman signed an undertaking affirming his understanding of \nand compliance with the Confidentiality Order, and that Dr. Eckelman had received I -Mab\u2019s confidential information. . . .  \n 95.  . . . Given Dr. Eckelman\u2019s central roles at  Inhibrx, his \nimproperly obtained knowledge of I -Mab\u2019s trade secrets inevitably \nbecame Inhibrx\u2019s knowledge [.]   \n (D.I. 49 at \u00b6\u00b6  29-30, 95 (emphasis added) )   \n  Defendants argue that the FAC\u2019s allegations are insufficient to s upport trade secret claims \nagainst Inhibrx, since Dr. Eckelman served as an expert witness for Tracon in his \u201c personal \ncapacity \u201d and \u201cthere are no facts alleged that indicate Inhibrx knew the terms of the \nConfidentiality Order or the Undertaking that Dr. Eckelman signed, let alone approved of them .\u201d  \n(D.I. 62 at 14- 15; see also D.I. 76 at 7)  Defendants  point out that a  key allegation about \nInhibrx\u2019s knowle dge of the alleged misappropriation, set out above  in paragraph 30 of the FAC , \nis made on \u201cinformation and belief .\u201d  (D.I. 62 at 15)  They note that \u201cpleading upon information \nand belief is permissible [w]here it can be shown that the requisite factual information is \npeculiarly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge or control \u2014[but only] so long as there are no \nboilerplate and conclusory allegations and [p]laintiffs . . . accompany their legal theory with \nfactual allegations that make their theoretically viable claim plausible .\u201d  McDermott v. \nClondalkin Grp., 649 F. App\u2019x 263, 267- 68 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks, citations \nand emphasis omitted) ( cited in  D.I. 62 at 15) .  And they assert that nowhere in the FAC does I -\nMab provide factual allegations that render it plausible that Inhibrx did, in fact, know about Dr. Eckelman\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct.  (D .I. 62 at 15)  \nTo that, I -Mab responds by ass erting that Inhibrx, inter alia , \u201cknew of Dr. Eckelman\u2019s \nmisrepresentations\u201d because \u201cgiven his roles at Inhibrx, Dr. Eckelman\u2019s knowledge of I- Mab\u2019s 21 \n trade secrets cannot reasonably be separated from Inhibrx\u2019s knowledge[.]\u201d  (D.I. 69 at 17)  In \nother words, I -Mab is arguing that it need not show that other employees at Inhibrx  knew of Dr. \nEckelman\u2019s trade secret misappropriation; instead, its position s eems to be that Inhibrx is \nvicariously liable for Dr. Eckelman\u2019s  own conduct  and knowledge .   \nThe caselaw indicates that in order for I -Mab to plausibly demonstrate  that Inhibrx is \nvicariously liable for Dr. Eckelman\u2019s conduct, I -Mab must plead facts showi ng that Dr. \nEckelman\u2019s trade secret misappropriation was committed within the scope of his employment.  \nSee, e.g., Navigation Holdings, LLC  v. Molavi , Case No. 19- CV-02644- LHK, 2020 WL \n5074307, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2020); EMSI Acquisition, Inc.  v. Contrarian Funds, LLC , \nC.A. No. 12648- VCS, 2017 WL 1732369, at *13 (Del. Ch. May 3, 2017).  And a n individual\u2019s \nconduct can be considered within the scope of his employment when it is performed, at least \npartly, to benefit the employer (even though the employer may forbid it).  Navigation Holdings , \n2020 WL 5074307, at *3 ; cf. Am. Bottling Co. v. Repole , C.A. No. N19C -03-048 AML CCLD, \n2020 WL 7787043, at *6 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 30, 2020) .   \nAlthough I -Mab does not seem to be asserting that Dr. Eckelman initially acted in his \nofficial capacity, ( see D.I. 69 at 8), in the Court\u2019s view, the FAC\u2019s allegations are sufficient to \nestablish that Dr. Eckelman\u2019s continued acts of misappropriation were committed within the scope of his employment at Inhibrx.  To that end, the FAC alleges that:  (1) Dr. E ckelman  has \n\u201ccentral roles\u201d at  Inhibrx, as he is the company\u2019s Co- Founder, Chief Scientific Officer and \nExecutive Vice President of Corporate Strategy ; (2) Dr. Eckelman has continue d to work in these \ncentral roles  at Inhibrx up through the time of this suit ; (3) Inh ibrx continues to allow Dr. \nEckelman  to work in the field of the trade secrets ; and (4) Dr. Eckelman continues to use I -\nMab\u2019s trade secrets in his official capacity to benefit Inhibrx.  (D.I. 49 at \u00b6\u00b6  4, 95, 172- 74)   22 \n Accordingly, the Court concludes that the claims against Inhibrx should not be dismissed \non this ground. \n3. Identifying Alleged Trade Secrets with Requisite Specificity  \nLastly, Defendants argue that I -Mab did not sufficiently allege the trade secrets at issue \nwith the requisite specificity.  (D.I. 62 at 18- 20)13  On this score, the parties agree that I -Mab was \nrequired to identify the trade s ecrets at issue in the FAC with \u201csufficient particularity so as to \nprovide notice to a defendant of what he is  accused of misappropriating and for a court to \ndetermine whether misappropriation has or is threatened to occur.\u201d  Lithero, LLC v. AstraZeneca \nPharms. LP , Civil Action No. 19- 2320- RGA, 2020 WL 4699041, at *1 (D. Del. Aug. 13, 2020) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ( cited in  D.I. 62 at 18); Flexible Techs., Inc. v. \nSharkNinja Operating LLC , Civil Action No. 18- 348-CFC, 2019 WL 1417465, at *2 (D. Del. \nMar. 29, 2019) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ( cited in  D.I. 69 at 17).  The \ndisputed issue is whether I -Mab has done so.  \nIn the Court\u2019s view, it has.  The FAC explains that the alleged trade secrets at issue relate \nto each of 10 inventive molecules that are in I -Mab\u2019s pre -clinical and clinical pipeline.  (D.I. 49 \nat \u00b6 59)  From there, the FAC provides additional information, on a molecule -by-molecule basis, \nabout the types of \u201cproprietary and confidential data\u201d that are sa id to make up the trade secrets at \nissue.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 60 -69)  With regard to two of the molecules, the information identified seems \n \n13  For the first time  in their  reply  brief,  Defendants  added a  new  argument  that was \nnot clearly  made in  their  opening brief  about  the insufficiency  of the allegations  regarding the  \nalleged  trade secrets  at issue.   There,  Defen dants  asserted  that the claims  should be  dismissed  \nbecause I-Mab failed  to \u201callege the  reasonable measures  [it] took to  protect  its trade secrets.\u201d  \n(D.I.  76 at  10)  Because Defendants  did not  make  this argument  in their  opening brief,  they  have \nwaived  the argument  at this stage,  and the Court  will not  address  it further.   See,  e.g., Sysmex \nCorp. v.  Beckman  Coulter, Inc ., Civil Action  No. 19-1642- JFB-CJB,  2022 WL 1786526, at  *6 \n(D. Del.  May  26, 2022);  Winters  v. Colvin , Civil Action  No. 09-460-CJB,  2013 WL  5956246, at  \n*22 n.20 (D.  Del.  Nov. 7,  2013)  (citing  cases).  23 \n pretty  particular \u2014drilling down to a fairly fine level of detail about the data at issue (i.e., \nidentifying the specific agr eement in which the data is located, or identifying very specific facts \nthat are said to make up the trade secrets).14  As to the trade secrets regarding the eight other \nmolecules, even if the FAC is a bit less specific in its description, it does still pr ovide more detail \nabout the particular types of \u201cproprietary and confidential data\u201d that is at issue.  The allegations \nas to \u201cTrade Secret 1\u201d are exemplary in this regard, as there, the relevant data is further described \nas \u201cCMC data, some potency data, some toxicity data, some pharmacokinetic data, and financial \nand business data regarding I -Mab\u2019s collaborations with I -Mab business partners for L14B[.]\u201d  \n(Id. at \u00b6 60)  Now admittedly, in these paragraphs, the FAC does not then go further and list out \nthe actual \u201cCMC\u201d or \u201cpotency\u201d or \u201cpharmacokinetic\u201d or \u201cfinancial\u201d or \u201cbusiness\u201d data (e.g., \nspecific numerical items) that I -Mab is referencing.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 60 -69)  But later in the FAC, I -\nMab provides more specificity, when it:  (1) lists the specific documents that Dr. Eckelman \nreceived or reviewed during his work as an expert; and (2) as to a significant number of those documents, on a document -by-document basis, describes which trade secrets (that is, which of \nTrade Secrets 1 -10) are found in each pa rticular document.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 97- 105, 111- 59)  When one \ntakes all of these allegations together, they appear to be sufficiently concrete and detailed so as to put Defendants on notice of the types of trade secrets that are really at issue in this case.  See \nProgressive Sterilization, LLC v. Turbett Surgical LLC , Civil Action No. 19 -627-CFC, 2020 WL \n1849709, at *6 (D. Del. Apr. 13, 2020) (concluding the same, where the alleged trade secrets \n \n14  (See D.I.  49 at  \u00b6 65 (describing  \u201cTrade Secret  6\u201d as \u201cattorney\u2019s  eyes only and \nhighly confidential  business  terms  regarding I-Mab\u2019s  License and Collaboration Agreement  with  \nAbbVie  for TJC4,  which is worth  up to  $1.94 billion  in milestones\u201d); id . at \u00b6 66 (describing \n\u201cTrade Secret  7,\u201d inter  alia, as  including the  fact \u201cthat  I-Mab had the capability  to provide  \ncomparable levels  of data for its  TJ-CD4B  molecule  to Tracon  that it provided to  Tracon  for its \nL14B  and L1A3  molecules  as of April  2020 [and  the fact that]  I-Mab was developing bispecific  \nantibodies  using anti -claudin 18.2 sequences  and anti-4-1BB sequences\u201d))  24 \n were identified by explaining the products they related to (\u201cSCORES  units\u201d) and by further \nnoting the underlying aspects of those products that were at issue (such as \u201c[m]ethodology for \nanalyzing microbial barrier properties\u201d or \u201c[m]ethodology for verifying sterilization efficacy\u201d or \u201c[i]mprovements to the SCORES transfer  cart, including modification of wheel base and \nimproved autoclave docking and transfer cart self -locking features\u201d)) (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted) , report and recommendation adopted, 2020 WL 3071951 (D.
