Joseph Hrubiec, M CGIVNEY , KLUGER , CLARK & INTOCCIA , P.C.; Gavin Fung, \nMichael E. DiFebbo, KENNEDYS LAW CMK  LLP,  Philadelphia, PA.  \n \nCounsel for  Plaintiff.  \n Danielle K. Yearick, T\nYBOUT , REDFEARN & PELL, Wilmington, DE.  \n \nCounsel for Defendant . \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nMarch 28, 2022  \n \n \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nInsurance can be complex. Sometimes neither the insurer nor the insured knows \nwhether a policy covers a claim . To settle the question, they can seek a declaratory \njudgment .  \nThat is what happened here. A  contractor was sued for tort in state court.  It \nthinks that any liability there should  be covered by its  insurance policy. Y et its in-\nsurance company disagrees . To settle the matter, the insurer brought  this declara-\ntory judgment action .  \nNow t he insured move s to stay or dismiss this case . This declaratory action is a \nstate problem best left to state court, it says , so this  federal  court should abstain \nfrom deciding  it.   \nI need not abstain. The parties ask whether an insurer has a duty to defend its \ninsured in a state -court case. A federa l court can decide that question  so I will an-\nswer it. But I cannot answer whether that  insurer must  also cover  damages not yet \nawarded  in state court. Because that duty -to-indemnify claim is unripe, I dismiss it \nwithout prejudice .  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nSea Light is a general contractor. It was  sued by one of its workers who got hurt \non the job. D.I. 1 -1; Aparicio -Munoz v. Sea Light Design -Build LLC, No. N2OC -07-\n170 (Del. Sup. Ct.).  \nAt the time, Evanston Insurance Company promised to defend Sea Light in \u201cbod-\nily injury\u201d lawsuits. D.I. 27 \u00b6 19. But Evanston could escape its duty to defend (and 3 any liability  from the lawsuit ) if any of the policy\u2019s exceptions applied.  D.I. 27  \u00b6 25.  \nEvanston thought that one did. So it sued, asking this C ourt to declare that it \nhas no  (1) duty to defend Sea Light or (2) duty to indemnify it for any damages. Id.  \n\u00b6 42(A)\u2013(B). Those duties are distinct under Delaware law, so I consider them sepa-\nrately. Charles E. Brohawn & Bros., Inc. v. Emps. Com.  Union Ins. Co. , 409 A.2d \n1055, 1058 (Del. 1979); accord Evanston Ins. Co. v. Layne Thomas Builders, Inc. , \n635 F. Supp. 2d 348, 352 (D. Del. 2009).  \nSea Light parries that I must wait before decid ing whether Evanston must in-\ndemnify it . D.I. 28 , at 9. It also argues that I should abstain from deciding whether \nEvanston owes it a duty to defend . D.I. 49 , at 4. Assuming I decide otherwise, Sea \nLight says that Evanston must indemnify and defend it.  D.I. 28 , at 15.  \nEvanston is half right. I cannot decide yet whether Sea Light must indemnify. \nBut I will exercise federal jurisdiction over the duty -to-defend claim.  \nIII. I DISMISS THE DUTY-TO-INDEMNIFY CLAIM AS UNRIPE  \nSea Light argues that it is too early for m e to decide whether Evanston has a \ncontractual duty to indemnify it.  I agree , so I dismiss as unripe the parties\u2019 dueling \ndeclaratory -judgment claims  over indemnity .  \nFederal courts cannot decide actions  \u201cin which there is no \u2018case[]\u2019 or \u2018controver-\nsy.\u2019\u201d Step-Saver Data Sys., Inc. v. Wyse Tech. , 912 F.2d 643, 647 (3d Cir. 1990) \n(quoting U.S. Const. art. III)). Put differently, a case must be ripe: \u201cthere [must be] \na legitimate dispute between the parties.\u201d Id.  4 To show that  its indemnity cla im is ripe, Evanston must show that :  \n\u2022 the parties\u2019 interests  are advers e; \n\u2022 a judgment would answer the ir question conclusively ; and \n\u2022 relief  would give them \u201cpractical help[ ] or utility .\u201d  \nId. But Evanston cannot  check these boxes .   \nA. The  parties are not yet adverse enough  \nAdversity means that \u201cactual harm will result if the declaratory judgment is not \ngranted.\u201d Layne Thomas Builders, 635 F. Supp. 2d at 353 (citing Step-Saver, 912 \nF.2d at 647\u2013 48). But here, the absence of relief does not mean  harm is inevitable.  \nFor one, t he state action is incomplete. If Sea Light is not liable to the worker , \nthen Evanston will owe nothing.  See Layne Thomas Builders , 635 F. Supp. 2d at \n353 (finding inadequate adve rsity on similar facts ); accord Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. \nInterdigital Comm c\u2019ns Corp. , 464 F. Supp. 2d 375, 380 (D. Del. 2006)  (same ). Even if \nSea Light  is liable, Evanston can try again with its indemnity claim.  \nOn the contrary, harm may  result if I grant  a declaratory judgment.  Evanston \nstill represents Sea Light in the action below  and may need to keep  doing so even  if \nit does not have an indemnity duty . See Charles E. Brohawn & Bros., Inc. , 409 A.2d \nat 1058 ( noting that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify).  Let-\nting Evanston pursue its indemnity claim here may \u201ccreate a conflict between [its] \nduty to defend and its interest in avoiding coverage.\u201d  See Am. State Ins. Co. v. Com-\nponent Techs., Inc. , 420 F. Supp. 2d 373, 375 (M.D. Pa. 2005) (dismissing as unripe \nan indemnity -duty claim before underlying tort action finished). Indeed,  discovery 5 here has already threatened such problems . For instance, Sea Light\u2019s Evanston -\nsponsored  counsel  objected  to deposition requests from Evanston\u2019s counsel in this  \nfederal action because the requests were \u201cdetrimental to the underlying [state] \ncase.\u201d  D.I. 47 -8, at 6.   \nB. A judgment would not be final or helpful  \nThe second and third boxes  also remain unchecked. A  judgment would not  nec-\nessarily  \u201cbe sufficiently conclusive\u201d  nor give practical guidance to the parties  about \nEvanston\u2019s duty to indemnify . Step-Saver, 912 F.2d at 648.  \nSuppose, for instance, that I rule that Evanston must indemnify Se a Light if Sea \nLight loses  in state court. Suppose further that Sea Light wins. My ruling will have \nzero bearing on what Evanston owes Sea Light. See Sphere Drake, P.L.C. v. 101 Va-\nriety, Inc. , 35 F. Supp. 2d 421, 430\u2013 31 (E.D. Pa. 1999). So that ruling woul d not \nhave concluded Evanston and Sea Light\u2019s dispute. See Hartford Fire, 464 F. Supp. 2d at 381 (finding the second and third Step -Saver factors not met on similar facts); \naccord Republic Servs. of Pa., LLC v. Caribbean Operators, LLC , 301 F. Supp. 3d \n468, 473\u2013 74 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (same).  \nPlus, granting declaratory judgment here would be impractical because it could \nlead to inconsistent results. Hartford Fire , 464 F. Supp. 2d at 381. Imagine that I \nrule that Evanston must indemnify Sea Light. But after, t he worker in the state \nsuit unearths a fact that would save Evanston. The parties might sue each other to \nsee which holding should stand. So a premature entry might end up encouraging \nmore litigation, not ending it. Id.  6 Yet Evanston may  have another  shot. The state action is scheduled for trial in \nNovember 2022. See Docket Rep ., Aparicio -Munoz v. Sea Light Design -Build, LLC, \nN2OC -07-170 (Del. Sup. Ct.) . If Sea Light is liable there , Evanston may  decide  to \nadd this claim back in. So I dismiss its  duty -to-indemnify claim  without prejudice.  \nII. I WILL DECIDE  THE DUTY-TO-DEFEND CLAIM  \nOrdinarily, federal courts have a \u201cvirtually unflagging obligation \u2026 to exercise \nthe jurisdiction given them.\u201d Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States , \n424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976). But cases under the Declaratory Judgment Act are differ-\nent.  \nThe Act says  that \u201cany court of the United States \u2026 may  declare the rights of [a \nparty]  \u2026 whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) \n(emphasis added). So \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has long held that the [Act] \u2026 \u2018confer[s] \n\u2026 unique and substantial discretion\u2019 upon district courts to decide whether to exer-\ncise jurisdiction in declaratory judgment actions.\u201d DiAnoia\u2019s Eatery, LLC v. Motor-\nists Mut. Ins. Co. , 10 F.4th 192, 196 (3d Cir. 2021) (quoting Wilton v. Seven Falls \nCo., 515 U.S. 277,  286\u201387 (1995)).  Thus , I may abstain from hearing an action un-\nder the Act.  \nBut my discretion  \u201cis not absolute.\u201d Id.  The Supreme Court has set forth a long \nlist of factors that  guide whether a federal judge should sidestep a declaratory \njudgment action . See Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of Am. , 316 U.S. 491, 495 (1942); \nDiAnoia\u2019s Eatery , 10 F. 4th at 196\u2013 97 (describing  modern  test).  \nHere, because Sea Light flagged \u201cthe propriety\u201d of federal jurisdiction, I must 7 \u201cmeaningfully consider\u201d these  factors , decide whether to abstain,  and make \u201ca rec-\nord [of my analysis] sufficient\u201d  for appellate review. Reifer v. Westport Ins. Corp. , \n751 F.3d 129, 146  n.22 (3d Cir. 2014) ; D.I. 52 , at 3. Because I dismiss the indemnity \nclaim, I consider only the duty to defend.  \nA. The absence of a parallel state action favors federal jurisdiction  \nI first look at whether there is a \u201cpending parallel state proceeding .\u201d DiAnoia\u2019s \nEatery , 10 F.4th at 196 . This is the most important factor. The existence of a paral-\nlel action  \u201cmilitates significantly\u201d in favor of abstaining jurisdiction; the absence of \none cuts the other way with equal force . Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, there is no parallel state action . The underlying  tort action does not count  \nbecaus e it has different parties and different claims.  Kelly v. Maxum Specialty Ins. \nGrp., 868 F.3d 274, 284, 287  (3d Cir. 2017).  \nThat absence puts a heavy thumb on the scale for  federal jurisdiction , but it is \nnot dispositive.  Id. at 282. I must now  \u201cbe rigorous in ensuring \u201d that this factor is \nnot outweighed by the others.  DiAnoia\u2019s Eatery , 10 F.4th at 197 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted) . \nB. The absence of a parallel  action is not outweighed by other factors  \nNext, I turn to the eight  factors outlined in Rei fer v. Westport Insurance Corp.  \n751 F.3d at 134\u2013 35. Here, three favor federal jurisdiction, four are neutral, and only \none favors abstention . \n1. Reifer factors 1, 2, and 3 favor federal jurisdiction.  Reifer first asks  whether a \nfedera l judgment \u201cwill resolve the uncertainty of obligation [that] gave rise to the 8 controversy.\u201d Id. at 146.  Here, the answer is yes , suggesting  that I should hear this \ncase.  \nTo decide whether Evanston has a duty to defend , I must interpret the insurance \npolicy  based on the state -complaint allegations . See Am. Ins. Grp. v. Risk Enter. \nMgmt., Ltd. , 761 A.2d 826, 829 (Del. 2000) . I can do that without encroaching on the \nstate tort action. See Di Anoia\u2019s Eatery , 10 F.4th at 205 \u20136. \nSecond, I look to whether coming to federal court would in convenience the par-\nties. Reifer, 751 F.3d at 146. Because it would not , this factor also favor s federal ju-\nrisdiction. Sea Light is a Delaware company based in Frankford, Delaware, making \na federal court  in Delaware  no less convenient than its state peer . D.I. 27 \u00b6 4. Plus, \nSea Light counterclaimed in this court, suggesting it was prepared to  litigat e here. \nD.I. 28; see Kelly , 868 F.3d at 288 (finding convenience in similar scenario) . \nThird, I look to the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in giving declaratory relief . Reifer , 751 F.3d \nat 146. This factor also leans in favor of jurisdiction . While  no special federal inter-\nest is implicated, I still have \u201cthe usual interest in the fair adjudication\u201d of this dis-\npute. Kelly , 868 F.3d at 288. And Sea Light has not flagged a novel state- law issue \ncutting the other way. See  DiAnoia\u2019s Eatery , 10 F. 4th at 207.  \n2. Factors 4 through 7  are neutral or do not apply.  Next, I look to the \u201cavailabil-\nity and relative convenience of other remedies .\u201d Reifer , 751 F.3d at 14 6. This factor \nis neutral since  a state court would be equal to th e task. See Kelly , 868 F.3d at 289  \n(same) .  9 And the next three  Reifer  factors do not apply. Factors 5 and 6 are relevant only \nif \u201cthe same issues are pending in a state court ,\u201d which is not the case  here. Reifer , \n751 F.3d at 135. Then Factor 7 asks whether this  declaratory action is being used \n\u201cas a method of procedural fencing or as a means to provide another forum in a race \nfor res judicata.\u201d Id. Yet there is no evidence of such abuse here: both parties sought \nrelief in this court . See D.I. 28 .  \n3. Factor 8 stands alone in favor of abstention.  The last Reifer  factor puts courts \non notice about the \u201cinherent conflict of interest between an insurer\u2019s duty to defend \nin a state court and its attempt to characterize that suit in federal court as falling  \n[outside the] policy.\u201d 751 F.3d at 1 46. That conflict exists her e. D.I. 51 , at 8. Indeed,  \nSea Light\u2019s state counsel has objected to its federal counsel\u2019s deposition requests. \nSee D.I. 47 -8, at 6.   \nBut that is the only  Reifer factor  that favors abstention , so it is not enough. See \nDiAnoia\u2019s Eatery , 10 F.4th at 197. I do not find \u201cthat the lack of pending parallel \nstate proceedings is outweighed.\u201d Reifer, 751 F.3d at 144.  \nC. The Summy  factors do not upend the balance  \nBecause this declaratory action involves  insurance coverage, two last factors ap-\nply. DiAnoia \u2019s, 10 F.4th at 197 (citing  State Auto Ins. Cos. v. Summy , 234 F.3d 131, \n134 (3d Cir. 2000) ). First, if \u201capplicable state law is \u2018 uncertain or undetermined,\u2019 [I] \nshould be particularly reluctant to exercise \u2026 jurisdiction. \u201d Reifer , 751 F.3d at 141 \n(quoting Summy , 234 F.3d at 135). Second , it is \u201cespecially important\u201d to \u201cseri-\nous[ly] consider []\u201d that \u201c [I am]  limited to predicting \u2014rather than establishing \u201410 state law. \u2019\u201d Reifer, 751 F.3d at 148 (internal quotation marks omitted) . \nThis dispute does not require me to resolve uncertain questions of state law. Ev-\nanston argues that it has no duty to defend because the  injuries suffered by  the \nstate plaintiff  are not covered by the insurance policy. D.I. 27 \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36\u2212 37, \n41\u221242( A)\u2013(B). That is a simple matter of contractual interpretation: does the state -\ntort complaint fall within the four corners of Evanston\u2019s policy? S ee Am. Ins. Grp. , \n761 A.2d at 829.  \nTrue , Sea Light argues that enforcing Evanston\u2019s exclusions would v iolate Dela-\nware law and public policy. Id.  at 11\u2013 12. But Delaware has  already  endorsed simi-\nlar policies with these kinds of exclusions . See, e.g. , Masonic Home of Del., Inc. v. \nCertain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London , 80 A.3d 960 (Del. 2013)  (employees of in-\ndependent contractor); Del. Ins. Guar . Ass\u2019n v. Valley Forge Ins. Co. , 1992 WL \n147998, at *6 (Del. Sup. Ct. June 9, 1992)  (worker\u2019s- compensation  exclusion ). So \nthis is not a case where district courts must \u201cstep back\u201d and let Delaware courts \u201cre-\nsolve unsettled [Delaware] law matters.\u201d Summy , 234 F.3d at 136.  \nThe two Summy  factors do not weigh in favor of abstention. Plus, t he other ab-\nstention  facto rs yield a strong presumption in favor of federal jurisdiction. So I re-\nject Sea Light\u2019s invitation to abstain jurisdiction, and I will thus hear the duty -to-\ndefend claim.  \n* * * * * \nBecause it is unripe, I dismiss Evanston\u2019s duty -to-indemnify action without \nprejudice.  And I exercise federal jurisdiction over its  duty -to-defend claim .  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nEVANSTON INSURANCE COMPANY  \n Plaintiff , \n \nv. \n SEA LIGHT DESIGN -BUILD, LLC  \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:20- cv-01685- SB \n  ORDER  \n1. I DISMISS WITHOUT PREJUDICE Evanston\u2019s request for a declaration  \nthat it does not have a duty to indemnify Sea Light. D.I. 27. Evanston\u2019s request for declaratory relief about its duty to defend may proceed.   \n \n2. I DENY  the motion to stay or dismiss this case under the Brillhart absten-\ntion doctrine . Brillhart v. Excess In s. Co.  of Am. , 316 U.S. 491, 495 (1942) ; see \nalso Reifer v. Westport Ins. Corp. , 751 F.3d 129 (3d Cir. 2014) .  \n \n3. I ORDER  the parties to meet and confer within two weeks of this order. I \norder them to submit a joint update on the underlying state tort action . See \nAparicio -Munoz v. Sea Light Design -Build LLC, No. N2OC -07-170 (Del. Sup. \nCt.). That update should not exceed one page, single- spaced. I also order the \nparties to submit a revised scheduling order.  \n \nIf outstanding discovery disputes preclude agreemen t on a scheduling order, \nthe parties shall  instead submit a joint document that includes a non- argu-\nmentative list of outstanding disputes that require Court attention. That list should not exceed five pages, single- spaced.  \n \n \nDated:  March  28, 2021 \n                __________________________________ \n                UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n"}
