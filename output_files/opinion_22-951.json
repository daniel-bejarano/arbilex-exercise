(D.I. 10; Gabriel Gray et \nal. v. Kathy Jennings, C.A. No. 1 :22-cv-01500, D.I. 4).1 The motions have been fully briefed. (D.I. \n11, 37, 44; Gabriel Gray et al. v. Kathy Jennings, C.A. No. 1 :22-cv-01500, D.I. 5).2 I heard lengthy . \nand helpful oral argument on February 24, 2023. (D.I. 54). For the reasons set forth below, the \nmotions are DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Nature and Stage of the Proceedings \nOn June 30, 2022, the State of Delaware enacted a package of gun safety bills, two of which \nare challenged here. One of them, House Bill 450 (\"HB 450\"), regulates assault weapons.3 An Act \nto Amend the Delaware Code Relating to Deadly Weapons , H.B. 450, 151st Gen. Assemb. (Del. \n2022) (codified at 11 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1464-1467 ). The other, Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 6 (\"SS \n1 for SB 6\"), regulates large-capacity magazines (\"LCMs\"). An Act to Amend Title 11 of the \nDelaware Code Relating to Deadly Weapons , Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 6, 151st Gen. \nAssemb. (Del. 2022) (codified at 11 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441, 1468-1469A ). \n1 Unless otherwise indicated, docket citations are to the docket in No. 22-951. \n2 The evidentiary record is limited. Defendants present a robust evidentiary record, including \ndeclarations from five expert witnesses . (D.I. 38-42). Plaintiffs do not challenge Defendants ' \nevidence with any testimonial evidence of their own. I note that nothing I find at this stage will \nbind my decisions that come later, once the parties have had more time to develop the evidentiary \nrecord. \n3 Plaintiffs call the designation \"assault weapons\" a \"complete misnomer \" that anti-gun publicists \ndeveloped \"in their crusade against lawful firearm ownership .\" (DSSA Br. at 8; Gray Br. at 5-6). \nDefendants argue that, to the contrary, the term \"assault weapon\" derives from the name of the \nfirst assault weapon-the German \"Strumgewehr ,\" which translates to \"storm rifle\"-and that the \nterm has long been used by the gun industry and government agencies. (D.I. 37 at 11). \nAs to who is right, I express no opinion. I will nevertheless refer to the semi-automatic \nfirearms regulated under HB 450 as \"assault weapons,\" as that is the term employed by the statute. \n2 On July 20, 2022, Plaintiffs in Delaware State Sportsmen 's Association , Inc. et al. v. \nDelaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security et al., C.A. No. 1:22-cv-00951 (the \n\"DSSA Action\") filed suit challenging HB 450 under the Second, Fifth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution, the Commerce Clause, and the Delaware Constitution.4 \n(D.I. 1). Plaintiffs also alleged preemption. (Id.). On September 9, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an \nAmended Complaint that added claims challenging SS 1 for SB 6. (D.I. 5). On November 15, \n2022, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of the statutes, on the \nbasis that the statutes violate their right to keep and bear arms under the Second and Fourteenth \nAmendments and Article I,\u00a7 20 of the Delaware Constitution. (D.I. 10 (\"DSSA Br.\")). On March \n14, 2023, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the Delaware state law claims brought \npursuant to Article I, \u00a7 20. (D.I. 56). \nOn November 16, 2022, Plaintiffs in Gabriel Gray et al. v. Kathy Jennings, C.A. No. 1 :22-\ncv-01500 (the \"Gray Action\") filed suit challenging HB 450 under the Second and Fourteenth \nAmendments. (Gray Action, D.I. 1). On November 22, 2022, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary \nand permanent injunction barring the enforcement of the statute, on the basis that the statutes \nviolate their right to keep and bear arms under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. (Gray \nAction, D.I. 4 (\"Gray Br.\")). \nOn January 12, 2023, Plaintiffs in Christopher Graham, et al. v. Kathy Jennings, C.A. No. \n1 :23-00033 (the \"Graham Action\") filed suit challenging SS 1 for SB 6 under the Second and \nFourteenth Amendments. (Graham Action, D.I. 1). \n4 There is no doubt that some of the defendants in this action are properly named. Defendants have \nnot raised the issue of whether this is true of all defendants. Therefore, I do not address it here. \n3 On December 20, 2022, the Gray Action was consolidated with the DSSA Action. (D.I. \n24; Gray Action, D.I. 12). On March 6, 2023, the Graham Action was consolidated with the DSSA \nAction as well. (D.I. 52; Graham Action, D.I. 8). Trial has been set for November 13-17, 2023. \n(D.I. 25). \nB. The Challenged Statutes \n1. HB 450 \nHB 450 makes numerous \"assault weapons\" illegal, subject to certain exceptions . 11 Del. \nC. \u00a7\u00a7 1464-1467. The list of prohibited firearms is long. It includes (1) forty-four enumerated \nsemi-automatic \"assault long gun[s],\" including the AR-15, AK-47, and Uzi, 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1465(2), \n(2) nineteen specifically identified semi-automatic \"assault pistol[s],\" id \u00a7 1465(3), and (3) \n\"copycat weapon[s] ,\" id \u00a7 1465(4). \"Copycat weapon[s]\" include semi-automatic, centerfire rifles \nthat can accept a detachable magazine and which have one of five features,5 semi-automatic pistols \nthat can accept a detachable magazine and which have certain similar enhanced characteristics, \nand certain other semi-automatic weapons. Id. \u00a7 1465(6). \nHB 450 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, purchase , receipt, transfer, possession \nor transportation of these weapons, subject to certain exceptions , including for military and law\u00ad\nenforcement personnel (including qualified retired law-enforcement personnel). Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1466(a), \n(b ). People who possessed or purchased assault weapons before the statute became effective can \ncontinue to possess and transport them under certain conditions , including (i) at their residence \nand place of business, (ii) at a shooting range, (iii) at gun shows, and (iv) while traveling between \nany permitted places. Id \u00a7 1466( c ). They can also transfer them to family members . Id. \n5 The features include a folding or telescoping stock, a forward pistol grip, a flash suppressor , and \na grenade launcher or flare launcher. 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1465(6)(a). Defendants refer to these features as \n\"military features.\" (D.I. 37 at 6). \n4 2. SS 1 for SB 6 \nSS 1 for SB 6 makes it illegal \"to manufacture , sell, offer for sale, purchase, receive, \ntransfer, or possess a large-capacity magazine.\" Id. \u00a7 1469(a). \"Large-capacity magazine[s]\" are \nthose \"capable of accepting, or that can readily be converted to hold, more than 17 rounds of \nammunition.\" Id. \u00a7 1468(2). The statute exempts many of the same individuals as HB 450, along \nwith individuals who have a valid concealed carry permit. Id. \u00a7 1469(c). Unlike HB 450, SS 1 for \nSB 6 does not grandfather any magazines. It does, however, require the State to implement a buy\u00ad\nback program. Id. \u00a7 1469( d). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nA preliminary injunction is \"an extraordinary remedy,\" and \"should be granted only in \nlimited circumstances .\" Kos Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 708 (3d Cir. 2004). A \nmovant seeking a preliminary injunction must establish (1) \"that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits,\" (2) \"that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,\" (3) \n\"that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and\" ( 4) \"that an injunction is in the public interest.\" \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). As the Supreme Court has noted, a \npreliminary injunction is \"a drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the movant, by \na clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.\" Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 \n(1997) (emphasis in original) (quoting l lA CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, \nFEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE\u00a7 2948 at 129-130 (2d ed. 1995)). \nThe first two factors are the \"most critical\" factors. Reilly v. City of Harrisburg, 858 F.3d \n173, 179 (3d Cir. 2017). The Third Circuit has explained that the first factor, likelihood of success \non the merits, \"requires a showing significantly better than negligible, but not necessarily more \nlikely than not.\" Id. The second factor, irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, \n5 requires a showing that irreparable harm is \"more likely than not.\" Id. If the movant meets these \n\"gateway factors,\" \"a court then considers the remaining two factors and determines in its sound \ndiscretion if all four factors, taken together, balance in favor of granting the requested preliminary \nrelief.\" Id. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nFor the following reasons, I conclude that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of \nestablishing the first two preliminary injunction factors: (1) likelihood of success on the merits, \nand (2) irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction . Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. I \ntherefore deny Plaintiffs' motions.6 \nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe governing case is New York State Rifle & Pistol Association , Inc. v. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. \n2111 (2022). I must first determine whether \"the Second Amendment 's plain text covers an \nindividual 's conduct.\" Id. at 2129-30. If the answer is no, then the Second Amendment does not \napply, and the regulation is constitutional. But if the answer is yes, then \"the Constitution \npresumptively protects that conduct,\" and it is the government 's burden to \"then justify its \nregulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm \nregulation.\" Id. at 2130. Only after performing this second step \"may a court conclude that the \n6 Other district courts have reached the same conclusion when faced with post-Bruen Second \nAmendment challenges to similar statutes. See, e.g., Bevis v. City of Naperville , Illinois, 2023 WL \n2077392 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 17, 2023) (denying TRO and preliminary injunction where plaintiffs \nchallenged legislation prohibiting sale of assault weapons and LCMs), appeal docketed, No. 23-\n1353 (7th Cir. Feb. 23, 2023); Ocean State Tactical, LLC v. State of Rhode Island, 2022 WL \n17721175 (D.R.I. Dec. 14, 2022) (denying preliminary injunction where plaintiffs challenged \nlegislation prohibiting possession of LCMs), appeal docketed, No. 23-01072 (1st Cir. Jan. 13, \n2023); Oregon Firearms Fed'n, Inc. v. Brown, 2022 WL 17454829 (D. Or. Dec. 6, 2022) (denying \nTRO where plaintiffs challenged legislation prohibiting sale and restricting use of LCMs ), appeal \nvoluntarily dismissed , No. 22-36011 (9th Cir. Dec. 12, 2022). \n6 individual 's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's unqualified command. \" Id ( cleaned \nup). \n1. LCMs and Assault Weapons are Protected by the Second Amendment \nThe Second Amendment provides: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the \nsecurity of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. \nCONST. amend. II. \"Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited \" \nand is \"not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for \nwhatever purpose.\" Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2128 (quoting District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. \n570, 626 (2008)). Only if \"the Second Amendment 's plain text covers an individual's conduct, \n[will] the Constitution presumptively protect(] that conduct.\" Id at 2129-30. To meet this threshold \nburden, which Plaintiffs concede is theirs (e.g., D.I. 44 at 2), a plaintiff must demonstrate that the \n\"textual elements\" of the Second Amendment 's operative clause apply to the conduct being \nrestricted. See 142 S. Ct. at 2134 (quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 592). \nDriving the analysis at this step are several key limitations to the scope of the Second \nAmendment 's coverage. First, the Second Amendment \"extends, prima facie, to all instruments \nthat constitute bearable arms.\" Heller, 554 U.S. at 582. Thus, Plaintiffs must show that the statutes \nat issue regulate weapons that fall under the Second Amendment 's definition of \"bearable arms.\" \nSecond, the Second Amendment extends only to bearable arms that are \"in 'common use' for self\u00ad\ndefense today.\" Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2143. Thus, Plaintiffs must also show that the statutes at issue \nregulate such arms. Third, the Second Amendment does not create a right to keep and carry \n\"dangerous and unusual weapons. \" Heller, 554 U.S. at 627. This limitation shares considerable \noverlap with the \"in common use\" requirement. Whether a weapon is \"in common use\" depends \non whether it is \"dangerous and unusual.\" See id at 627 (cleaned up) (\"[A]s we have explained ... \n7 the sorts of weapons protected were those in common use at the time. We think that limitation is \nfairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual \nweapons.\"); Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2143 (\"[T]he Second Amendment protects only the carrying of \nweapons that are those in common use at the time, as opposed to those that are highly unusual in \nsociety at large.\" (cleaned up)). \nAs an initial matter, the parties dispute the scope of the \"common use\" limitation described \nabove. Plaintiffs argue that they \"only have to show that the restricted arms are ... in common use \ntoday for lawful purposes\" (D.I. 44 at 2), \"of which self-defense is but one of many\" (id. at 3). \nDefendants counter that \"the Second Amendment does not protect weapons simply because they \nare common.\" (D.I. 37 at 32). Instead, say Defendants , Plaintiffs must show \"that assault weapons \nand LC Ms are in 'common use' today for the lawful purpose of self-defense.\" (Id.). \nAlthough the Supreme Court has not spoken on this question directly, it has repeatedly \nemphasized the centrality of self-defense to the Second Amendment right. Heller and McDonald \nv. Chicago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010) stand for the proposition \"that the Second and Fourteenth \nAmendments protect an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\" Bruen, 142 S. Ct. \nat 2125 ( emphasis added) ( characterizing the holding of both cases). In Bruen, the Court held ''that \nthe Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual's right to carry a handgun/or self\u00ad\ndefense outside the home.\" Id. at 2122 ( emphasis added). The Court explained in Heller that self\u00ad\ndefense is the \"core\" of the Second Amendment right, 554 U.S. at 630, the right's \"central \ncomponent,\" id. at 599 (emphasis in original), and the motivation for the Second Amendment's \ncodification in a written Constitution. Id. Self-defense was no less essential in Bruen, which turned \non the Court's conclusion that, \"handguns ... are indisputably in 'common use' for self-defense \ntoday.\" 142 S. Ct. at 2143 (quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 629). Notably, Bruen tethered its \"common \n8 use\" analysis to self-defense. See 142 S. Ct. at 2134-35 (concluding that \"[t]he Second \nAmendment 's plain text thus presumpti vely guarantee s petitioners Koch and Nash a right to 'bear' \narms in public for self-defense ,\" id. at 2135); see also id. at 2134 (\"Nor does any party dispute that \nhandguns are weapons 'in common use' today for self-defense \"). \nPlaintiffs point to various instances in which the Supreme Court addresses the \"common \nuse\" requirement without mentioning self-defense. For example, Plaintiffs repeatedl y highlight the \nCourt's statement that the colonial laws at issue \"provide no justification for laws restricting the \npublic carry of weapons that are unquestionably in common use today,\" id. at 2143, arguing that \nthis supports a broad reading of \"in common use.\" (D.I. 44 at 7, 15). But in context, it seems that \nthe Court was referring to \"common use\" for self-defense. Indeed, in the sentence immediatel y \npreceding the sentence that Plaintiffs cite, the Court concluded that \"[handguns] are, in fact, 'the \nquintessential self-defense weapon.\"' Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2143. Plaintiffs also point to an assertion \nby the D.C. Circuit that the Supreme Court \"said the Second Amendment protects the right to keep \nand bear arms for other lawful purposes, such as hunting.\" Heller v. District of Columbia, 670 F.3d \n1244, 1260 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 630). The D.C. Circuit appeared to rely on \nthe Court's statement in Heller that, in the colonial and revolutionary war era, \"[t]he traditional \nmilitia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms 'in common use at the time' for lawful \npurposes like self-defense .\" Heller, 554 U.S. at 630. The statement , although certainly favorable \nto Plaintiffs' view, is far from a clear pronouncement on the scope of the right. \nAs Defendants note, Plaintiffs ' formulation would seem to \"upend settled law.\" (Id. at 33). \nOne such law is the National Firearms Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1236, which restricts civilian \nacquisition and circulation of fully automatic weapons, such as machine guns. (D.I. 40 at 36). At \noral argument , Defendant s presented evidence that, as of 2016, there were nearly 176,000 legal \n9 civilian-owned machine guns in the United States.7 (D.I. 50-1, Ex. A at 2). That number comes \nclose to the quantity of weapons that Plaintiffs , in their reply brief, identify as sufficient for \n\"common use.\" (See D.I. 44 at 9) (arguing that \"the sale of approximately 200,000 stun guns was \nenough for them to be considered in common use by Justice Alito\" in his concurrence in Caetano \nv. Massachusetts , 577 U.S. 411,420 (2016) (Alito, J., concurring)).8 Thus, under Plaintiffs ' logic, \nan unqualified \"common use\" rule could render the National Firearms Act's machine gun \nrestrictions constitutionally suspect. The Supreme Court, however, has said that it would be \n\"startling\" to suggest that those restrictions might be unconstitutional. Heller, 554 U.S. at 624. The \nSupreme Court's confidence in the constitutionality of the National Firearms Act therefore casts \ndoubt on Plaintiffs' argument. \nThe question is a close one. My sense is that Defendants are correct, and the \"in common \nuse\" inquiry turns on whether a regulated weapon is \"in common use\" for self-defense. For the \npurposes of this opinion, however, the rule I choose does not affect the outcome of the analysis, \nas I conclude that Plaintiffs have shown that at least some of the prohibited assault weapons and \nLCMs pass muster under both versions of the \"in common use\" requirement. \na. Assault weapons \n7 Defendants assert in their opposition brief that \"there are over 741,000 registered machine guns \nin the United States today. (D.I. 37 at 32). As Defendants acknowledged at oral argument (D.I. 54 \nat 99), the 176,000 figure is more precise, as it excludes, for example, machine guns in law \nenforcement. \n8 Plaintiffs' characterization of Justice Alito's concurrence is slightly off the mark. The 200,000-\nfigure was in reference to the number of civilians who owned stun guns, not the number of stun \nguns that had been sold. Caetano, 577 U.S at 420 (Alito, J., concurring). As Plaintiffs note (D.I. \n44 at 9), in that concurrence, \"the touchstone for 'common use' was ownership .\" See Caetano, 577 \nU.S. at 420 (Alito, J., concurring) ( concluding that stun gun ban violates Second Amendment \nbecause \"stun guns are widely owned and accepted as a legitimate means of self-defense across \nthe country\"). \n10 The parties do not dispute that assault weapons belong to the broad category of weapons \nconstituting \"bearable arms.\" (See D.I. 54 at 111 (Defendants acknowledging that, for example, a \nbazooka would fall within this category); id. at 14 (Plaintiffs acknowledging the same)). The sole \nquestion, then, is whether assault weapons satisfy the \"in common use\" requirement and are \ntherefore presumptivel y entitled to constitutional protection. I think that Defendants ' narrower \nview of that requirement-that is, the view that a bearable arm must be \"in common use\" for self\u00ad\ndefense-is the correct one. For the following reasons, however, I conclude that Plaintiffs have \nestablished that some-but not all-of the regulated assault weapons satisfy both Defendants ' and \nPlaintiffs ' formulations of the requirement. \nI begin with \"assault pistols.\" Plaintiffs do not devote much argument to these weapons. In \nfact, between Plaintiffs ' opening briefs and joint reply brief, only a single paragraph specificall y \naddresses whether the banned assault pistols are \"in common use.\" In that paragraph , Plaintiffs \nassert that the \"assault pistols\" listed in HB 450 constitute \"common handguns \" that are, per Bruen, \nundisputedly in common use today for self-defense (DSSA Br. at 6 (citing Bruen's recognition of \nhandguns as \"the quintessential defense weapon,\" 142 S. Ct. at 2119)). Plaintiffs do not, however, \naccompany this assertion with any support. This is not enough to satisfy Plaintiffs ' burden at the \npreliminary injunction stage. See Mazurek, 520 U.S. at 972 (emphasizing that the movant for a \npreliminary injunction carries a steep burden of persuasion ). I therefore decline to find that assault \npistols are \"in common use\" and thus \"presumptivel y protect[ ed]\" by the Second Amendment. \nBruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2111. \nNext, I turn to \"copycat weapons.\" Plaintiffs ' argument on these weapons is scant as well. \nAlthough Plaintiffs assert that \"[s]o-called 'copycat weapons' and their specific features ... are \nalso in common use\" (Gray Br. at 7), Plaintiffs do not go on to explain why this is so. \n11 Consequently, I find that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy their burden of persuasion as to copycat \nweapons. \nFinally, I turn to \"assault long guns.\" Here, Plaintiffs provide ample support for their \nargument that such weapons are \"in common use\" for lawful purposes that include self-defense.9 \nPlaintiffs show that AR-style rifles-one of the types of \"assault long guns\" that HB 450 \nprohibits-are popular. According to one recent survey of gun owners in the United States, 30.2 \npercent of gun owners (approximately 24.6 million Americans) have owned up to forty-four \nmillion AR-15 or similar rifles. (Gray Br. at 5 (citing William English, 2021 Nat'l Firearms \nSurvey: Updated Analysis Including Types of Firearms Owned 1 (May 13, 2022) (Georgetown \nMcDonough School of Business Research Paper No. 4109494) , https://bit.ly/3yPfoHw )).10 \nPlaintiffs assert that the number of assault rifles \"in circulation \" today \"approaches twenty \nmillion.\" 11 (DSSA Br. at 7). Gun owners seek such rifles for a variety of lawful uses, including \nrecreational target shooting, self-defense , collecting , hunting, competition shooting, and \nprofessional use. (Id at 6 ( citing NA T'L SHOOTING SPORTS FOUND., INC., Modem Sporting Rifle \nComprehensive Consumer Report 18 (July 14, 2022), \n9 Several of the authorities relied upon by Plaintiffs do not appear to be publicly available. (E.g., \nGray Br. at iv (\"NAT'L SHOOTING SPORTS FOUND., INC., Firearms Retailer Survey Report \n(2013)\")). As Plaintiffs did not attach those authorities to any of their briefs, I decline to consider \nthem here. \n10 Plaintiffs ' source did not differentiate between guns used by civilians and guns used by law \nenforcement officers, who may have been represented in the survey. Id at 19. The numbers that \nPlaintiffs report might therefore be imprecise-but not drastically so, as \"the number of law \nenforcement officers in the U.S. is well under a million.\" Id \n11 At oral argument , Plaintiffs said that the total number of weapons in circulation that fall under \nHB 450's prohibitions is \"perhaps 10 million,\" but, given the unreliability of survey data, \"possibly \nquite a lot more.\" (D.I. 54 at 24-25). As Defendants note, even twenty million is only \"a small \nfraction of the more than 470 million guns in the United States.\" (D.I. 37 at 15). The Supreme \nCourt has not clarified the meaning of \"common use,\" as the issue was undisputed in Bruen, 142 \nS. Ct. at 2119. I think that ten million in circulation is enough. \n12 https://www3.nssf.org/share/PDF /pubs/NSSF-MSR-Comprehensive-Consumer-Report.pdf) ). \nTaken together, these data suggest that the banned assault long guns are indeed \"in common use\" \nfor several lawful purposes, including self-defense. \nDefendants disagree. They argue that the banned assault weapons, unlike handguns , are \nnot well-suited for any of the lawful purposes that Plaintiffs identify. (D.I. 37 at 17-20 (explaining \nthat assault weapons have limited utility for self-defense , hunting, and recreation )). Plaintiffs argue \nthat, to the contrary, assault weapons are useful for each of those purposes. (E.g., Gray Br. at 6-7 \n(contending that the AR-15 is \"an optimal firearm to rely on in a self-defense encounter \"); id. at 8 \n( contending that certain shared features of the prohibited assault weapons, such as flash \nsuppressors and telescoping stocks, are helpful for hunting and sport shooting)). This dispute \nseems to me to be beside the point.12 As Plaintiffs argued in their reply brief (D.I. 44 at 4) and at \noral argument (D.I. 54 at 142), the relevant question here is \"what the people choose\" for lawful \npurposes, rather than a weapon's objective suitability for those purposes. (Id.). See Heller, 554 \nU.S. at 629 (\"Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans \nfor self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid.\"). \nDefendants make the related argument that, because \"assault weapons are rarely utilized in \ndefense situations ,\" they cannot be \"in common use\" for self-defense purposes. (See D.I. 37 at 19). \nDefendants cite data showing that assault weapons were used for self-defense in less than 1 percent \nof\"active shooter\" incidents over the last two decades (D.I. 38 at 15), and that rifles of any type \nare only used for self-defense in a small minority of incidents. (Id. at 18-19). This argument does \nnot convince me either. I agree with Plaintiffs that the plain terms of the Second Amendment-\n12 As Defendants offer expert testimony on this point (e.g., D.I. 42 at 49-54), and Plaintiffs have \noffered no comparable evidence in response, I am inclined to agree with Defendants that assault \nweapons are not the optimal frrearms for self-defense. \n13 which protects the right to \"keep and bear Arms,\" U.S. CONST. amend. II-\"contemplates ways of \n'using' firearms other than just shooting them.\" (D.I. 44 at 8). For example, the Supreme Court \nstated that \"bear arms\" means to \"wear, bear, or carry ... upon the person or in the clothing or in a \npocket, for the purpose ... of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of \nconflict with another person.\" Heller, 554 U.S. at 582-84 (alterations in original) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). See also Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2134 (noting that \"individuals often 'keep' \nfirearms in their home, at the ready for self-defense .... \"). Consequentl y, I do not think it matters, \nfor the purposes of this analysis, that assault weapons are seldom fired in self-defense . What \nmatters is that they are commonly owned for the purpose of self-defense , which, as explained, \nPlaintiff has sufficiently shown. \nNext, Defendants argue that the listed assault long guns cannot be deemed to be \"in \ncommon use\" today, as they, along with the other prohibited weapons, are \"dangerous and \nunusual.\" (D.I. 37 at 30-31). Defendants contend that the \"dangerous and unusual\" test is an \ninquiry into whether the regulated item is \"unusually dangerous. \" Defendants ' reasoning is as \nfollows. In Heller, the Supreme Court cited Blackstone as support for the historical tradition of \nprohibiting the carrying of\"dangerous and unusual\" weapons. 554 U.S. at 2817. Defendants point \nto the originating text, in which Blackstone employed the phrase \"dangerous or unusual weapons. \" \n(D.I. 37 at 31) (emphasis in original). They argue that this phrase is a figure of speech that means \n\"unusually dangerous ,\" and that, consequentl y, \"unusually dangerous \" is the proper interpretation \nof \"dangerous and unusual.\" (Id.). \nThis argument , although interesting and perhaps meritorious as a historical matter, asks me \nto ignore the great weight of authority to the contrary. I decline to do so. The test is \"dangerous \nand unusual,\" and to fall outside the Second Amendment 's protection , a weapon must check both \n14 boxes. See Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2128; see also Caetano, 577 U.S. at 417 (Alito, J., concurring) \n(\"[T]his is a conjunctive test: A weapon may not be banned unless it is both dangerous and unusual. \nBecause the Court rejects the lower court's conclusion that stun guns are 'unusual,' it does not \nneed to consider the lower court's conclusion that they are also 'dangerous. \"' (emphasis in \noriginal)). \nDefendants ' trouble is that, although they thoroughly demonstrate that the prohibited \nassault long guns are \"dangerous\" (and probably \"unusually dangerous \"), see infra Section III.A.2, \nthey cannot show that assault long guns are \"unusual.\" As discussed , Plaintiffs have sufficiently \ndemonstrated that assault long guns are numerous and \"in common use\" for a variety of lawful \npurposes. I therefore conclude that the prohibited assault long guns are in common use for self\u00ad\ndefense, and therefore \"presumptively protect[ ed]\" by the Second Amendment. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. \nat 2111. \nb. Large-Capacity Magazines \nFirst, I address the question of whether LCMs are \"arms.\" The Third Circuit answered this \nquestion in the affirmative in Ass 'n of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs, Inc. v. Att '.Y Gen. New \nJersey, 910 F .3d 106 (3d Cir. 2018) (hereinafter \"ANJRPC'), a pre-Bruen case. There, the statute \nat issue limited the amount of ammunition that could be held in a single firearm magazine to no \nmore than 10 rounds. Id. at 110. The Third Circuit held, \"Because magazines feed ammunition \ninto certain guns, and ammunition is necessary for such a gun to function as intended, magazines \nare 'arms' within the meaning of the Second Amendment. \" Id. at 116. Defendants argue that this \ndecision is distinguishable in light of the difference between the restrictions at issue. (D.I. 37 at \n29). InANJRPC, 910 F.3d at 110, the upper limit was a capacity of 10 rounds; here, the upper limit \nis 17 rounds. 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1468(2). Defendants argue that the Third Circuit's decision \"rested upon \n15 the conclusion that the ban on smaller magazines could 'make it impossible to use firearms for \ntheir core purpose.\"' (D.I. 37 at 29). Defendants point out that Plaintiffs do not make any such \nclaim here. (Id.). Indeed, Plaintiffs admit that they are not aware of any firearms that come with a \nmagazine holding over 17 rounds that cannot also be operated using a smaller magazine. (D.I. 48 \nat 1). \nI am not convinced , however, that this makes a difference. The Third Circuit did not restrict \nits holding to magazines necessary for the operation of certain frrearms; rather, it broadly held that \n\"magazines are 'arms.\"' ANJRPC , 910 F.3d at 106. I think that I am bound by its decision, \nnotwithstanding Defendants ' evidence regarding the historical definition of \"arms\" (D.I. 39), and \nthe existence of decisions from district courts in other circuits that hold to the contrary. E.g., Ocean \nState Tactical, LLC v. State of Rhode Island, 2022 WL 17721175 , at *13 (D.R.I. Dec. 14, 2022) \n(finding that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that LCMs are \"arms\" within the meaning of the \nSecond Amendment) , appeal docketed, No. 23-01072 (1st Cir. Jan. 13, 2023). Magazines are arms, \nand so are LCMs. \nSecond, I address the question of whether LCMs are \"in common use\" for self-defense \ntoday. The Third Circuit addressed this question as well, although less definitively. Applying the \nnow-defunct two-step approach under intermediate scrutiny, the Third Circuit \"assume( d] without \ndeciding that LC Ms are typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\" \nANJRPC , 910 F.3d at 116. It did, however, observe that \"millions of magazines are owned, often \ncome factory standard with semi-automatic weapons,\" and \"are typically possessed by law-abiding \ncitizens for hunting, pest-control , and occasionally self-defense. \" Id. \nPlaintiffs sufficiently demonstrate that this is so. They argue, \"There are currently tens of \nmillions of rifle magazines that are lawfully-possessed in the United States with capacities of more \n16 than seventeen rounds,\" including magazines for the AR-15 rifle (DSSA Br. at 9), which I have \nalready found to be \"in common use\" for self-defense. The AR-15 platform is capable of accepting \nstandard magazines of 20 or 30 rounds (id. at 9) and is \"typically sold with 30-round magazines. \" \nDuncan v. Becerra, 366 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1145 (S.D. Cal. 2019); (D.I. 54 at 69). Indeed, Plaintiffs \npoint to evidence suggesting that \"52% of modem sporting rifle magazines in the country have a \ncapacity of 30 rounds.\" (D.I. 44 at 16). This is enough to show that LCMs are \"in common use\" \nfor self-defense . \nDefendants respond with the same suitability arguments they raised with respect to assault \nweapons. For example , Defendants argue that LCMs with more than 17 rounds are \"unnecessary \nfor self-defense \" because self-defense situations \"rarely, if ever, involve lengthy shootouts with \nextensive gunfire,\" and data suggest that individuals who use firearms for self-defense rarely fire \neven 10 rounds. (D.I. 37 at 19). They also contend that LCMs are ill-suited for hunting, which \n\"prioritizes limited, precise shots over a high volume of shots\" (id.), and recreation , as LCMs \naren't necessary for the use of assault rifles in shooting competitions (id. at 20). I reject these \narguments for the same reasons I rejected them with respect to assault long guns: suitability is \nimmaterial here. Likewise , I reject Defendants ' \"dangerous and unusual\" argument as to LCMs \n(D.I. 37 at 31-32) for the same reasons I did so with respect to assault long guns: LCMs, although \n\"dangerous ,\" see Section III.A.2 infra, are not \"unusual.\" \nFor these reasons, I conclude that the prohibited LCMs, like the prohibited assault long \nguns, are in common use for self-defense and therefore \"presumpti vely protect[ ed]\" by the Second \nAmendment. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2111. \nAccording to Plaintiffs , this is the end of the matter. Plaintiffs argue that, once a weapon is \nfound to be \"in common use\" within the meaning of the Second Amendment , it cannot be \n17 regulated, and no historical analysis is necessary. (D.I. 54 at 29-30). I disagree. As the Supreme \nCourt made clear in Bruen, \"the standard for applying the Second Amendment is as follows: When \nthe Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively \nprotects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is \nconsistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. \" 142 S. Ct. at 2129-30 \n( emphasis added). If the standard were as Plaintiffs propose, then Bruen need not have proceeded \nbeyond the first step of the analysis. Instead, however , after concluding that the Second \nAmendment 's plain text \"presumptively guarantee[d]\" the plaintiffs a right to bear arms in public \nfor self-defense, the Supreme Court turned to the question of historical tradition. Id. at 2135. Thus, \nso do I. \n2. Historical Tradition \nAt this step, the burden shifts to the government to \"justify its regulation by demonstrating \nthat it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\" Id. at 2129-30. In \nconducting this historical inquiry, \"[c]ourts are ... entitled to decide a case based on the historical \nrecord compiled by the parties.\"13 Id. at 2130 n.6. \nThe parties dispute which historical periods are relevant. Plaintiffs argue that I may \nconsider history from the late nineteenth century and the twentieth century. (D.I. 37 at 33). \nPlaintiffs disagree. (D.I. 44 at 18). In Bruen, the Supreme Court provided the following guidance : \n[W]hen it comes to interpreting the Constitution, not all history is created equal. \n\"Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the \npeople adopted them.\" Heller, 554 U.S. at 634-35. The Second Amendment was adopted \nin 1791; the Fourteenth in 1868. Historical evidence that long predates or postdates either \ntime may not illuminate the scope of the right. \n13 I reiterate that the evidentiary record at this stage is limited to the extent that it is almost entirely \nsupplied by Defendants . The analysis that follows is made on this limited record. \n18 142 S. Ct. at 2119. Defendants concede that regulations that existed in temporal proximity to 1791 \nand 1868 are \"the most relevant.\" (D.I. 54 at 132). Defendants are correct, however, that these are \nnot the only relevant historical evidence . As the Court explained in Bruen, subsequent history may \nbe relevant to the inquiry as '\" a regular course of practice' can 'liquidate & settle the meaning of' \ndisputed or indeterminate 'terms & phrases' in the Constitution. \" 142 S. Ct. at 2136 (quoting \nChiafalo v. Washington , 140 S. Ct. 2316 (2020)). However, \"to the extent later history contradicts \nwhat the text says, the text controls.\" Id. at 2137. Thus, I must afford later history little weight \n\"when it contradicts earlier evidence.\" Id. at 2154 (citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 614). \nAnother question is which historical regulations count as analogous. The Court \nacknowledged , \"[T]he regulatory challenges posed by firearms today are not always the same as \nthose that preoccupied the Founders in 1791 or the Reconstruction generation in 1868.\" Id. at 2132. \nThus, \"cases implicating unprecedented societal concerns or dramatic technological changes may \nrequire a more nuanced approach. \" Id. \"When confronting such present-da y firearm regulations ,\" \nthe historical inquiry should be guided by \"reasoning by analogy.\" Id. at 2133. A historical \nanalogue need not be a \"historical twin\"; \"even if a modem-day regulation is not a dead ringer for \nhistorical precursors , it still may be analogous enough to pass constitutional muster.\" Id. (emphasis \nomitted). Although the Court declined to \"provide an exhaustive survey of the features that render \nregulations relevantly similar under the Second Amendment ,\" the Court said that \"central \nconsiderations \" of the inquiry are \"whether modem and historical regulations impose a comparable \nburden on the right of armed self-defense and whether that burden is comparabl y justified. \" Id. at \n2132-33 (cleaned up). \nWith these principles in mind, I begin by examining the regulations at issue here. HB 450 \nand SS 1 for SB 6 were enacted in the immediate aftermath of several mass shootings. On May \n19 24, 2022, a gunman used an AR-15 style rifle and 30-round magazines to murder nineteen students \nand two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. (D.I. 37 at 2). This occurred only ten \ndays after another mass shooting, in which a gunman used an AR-15 style rifle and 30-round \nmagazines to murder ten people in a grocery store in Buffalo, New York. (Id). Delaware enacted \nHB 450 and SS 1 for SB 6 approximately one month later, with the stated purpose of furthering \nDelaware's \"compelling interest to ensure the safety of Delawareans. \" HB 450. The preamble to \nHB 450 references both tragedies, as well as \"dozens more mass shootings during the last decade,\" \nand notes several exceptional dangers of\"assault-style weapons,\" including their \"immense killing \npower,\" military origins, and disproportionate use in mass shootings. Id \nDefendants argue that the instant regulations implicate \"unprecedented societal concerns\" \nand \"dramatic technological changes.\" (D.I. 37 at 33). I agree. First, Defendants show that assault \nlong guns and LCMs represent recent advances in technology. Defendants offer evidence that \nsemi-automatic weapons \"did not become feasible and available until the beginning of the \ntwentieth century, and the primary market was the military.\" (D.I. 40 at 24). Although multi-shot \nor repeating firearms existed in America during the colonial and founding eras, they \"were rare \nand viewed as curiosities.\" (D.I. 37 at 7 (citing D.I. 40 at 20-24; D.I. 41 at 12; D.I. 39 at 1)). Neither \nwere repeating rifles popular during the Civil War and Reconstruction; during these periods, they \nwere used sparingly as military weapons and were available for civilian acquisition in limited \nnumbers. (D.I. 40 at 26). It was only after World War I when semi-automatic and fully automatic \nlong guns \"began to circulate appreciably in society.\" (Id at 28). Plaintiffs do not rebut \nDefendants ' evidence with any comparable historical evidence of their own.14 \n14 Plaintiffs argue that LCMs have been in common use \"for centuries.\" (DSSA Br. at 9). They \ncall attention to the Girandoni air rifle, a multi-shot gun with a 20 or 22-shot magazine capacity, \none of which was carried by Meriwether Lewis on the Lewis and Clark expedition. (Id). But as \n20 Second, Defendants show that assault weapons and LCMs implicate unprecedented \nsocietal concerns. Defendants offer evidence that suggests a rise in the yearly rate of public mass \nshootings over the past four decades. (See D.I. 54 at 139 (citing D.I. 38-1, Ex. C)). They also show \nthat, as noted in the preamble to HB 450, mass shootings often involve assault weapons equipped \nwith LCMs. (D.I. 37 at 23-24). One analysis, which examined almost two hundred mass shootings \nacross four databases , concluded that assault weapons were used in nearly a quarter of the incidents \nfor which the type of weapon could be determined (D.I. 38 at 24), and that LCMs were involved \nin the majority of the incidents for which magazine capacity could be determined. (Id. at 24-25). \nThe same analysis found that mass shootings involving assault weapons and LCMs result in more \nfatalities and injuries than those that do not. (Id. at 25-26). This result is consistent with the results \nof other studies on mass shootings. (Id. at 26-28). \nIn light of the current evidentiary record, it is not surprising that mass shootings involving \nassault weapons and LCMs result in increased casualties. As I have mentioned , see supra Section \nIII.A. I, Defendants demonstrate that assault rifles and LCMs are exceptionally dangerous . \nDefendants offer evidence that both derive from weapons of war. (D.I. 42 at 18-28 (assault rifles); \nid. at 31-32 (LCMs)). This fact is insufficient , on its own, to show that these arms are particularly \ndestructive ; a weapon's origins do not say much about that weapon's destructiveness today. \nDefendants go further, however. They identify several \"military\" features that assault rifles share \nthat \"increase their lethality,\" such as \"pistol grips and barrel shrouds for maneuverability , use of \ndetachable magazines to fire many rounds rapidly, and the use of intermediate-caliber rounds frred \nat a high velocity, which inflict severe wounds even over long distances. \" (D.I. 37 at 11-12). \nDefendants point out (D.I. 37 at 7-8 n.l), Plaintiffs ' own source suggests that this rifle was rare. \n(See D.I. 37-1, Ex. 1 at pp. 3-6). \n21 This last characteristic is one that Defendants discuss at length. (Id. at 21-22). Because an \nassault rifle bullet travels at multiple times the velocity of a handgun bullet, it imparts an \n\"exponentially greater\" amount of energy upon impact. (D.1. 37-2, Ex. 12 at 3). Furthermore , as \nthe result of its high speed, an assault rifle bullet typically \"yaws\" upon contact with tissue, \nmeaning that the bullet turns sideways. (D.1. 42 at 26-27). The resulting wounds are \"catastrophic. \" \n(D.I. 37 at 21). Upon passing through a target, the bullet's \"blast wave\" creates a temporary cavity \nthat can be \"up to 11-12.5 times\" larger than the bullet itself. (D.I. 37-2, Ex. 12 at 4; D.I. 42 at 27). \nThe yaw movement of the bullet can cause it to fragment upon striking bone, contributing to \nadditional tissue damage extending beyond the cavity. (D.I. 42 at 27). Doctors who treat victims \nof assault rifles encounter \"multiple organs shattered,\" bones \"exploded,\" soft tissue \"absolutely \ndestroyed ,\" and exit wounds \"a foot wide.\" (D.I. 37-2, Ex. 12 at 2, 6). Due to their severity, these \ninjuries often cannot be repaired. (Id. at 4). Handgun bullets, by contrast, only injure a structure \nby striking it directly; although they produce a small temporary cavity, that cavity \"plays little or \nno role in the extent of wounding.\" (D.I. 42-1, Ex. 1 at p. 183). The power and velocity of assault \nrifle bullets pose a particularly high risk to law enforcement officers. (D.I. 37 at 22). Although the \nbody armor typically issued to law enforcement officers protects against most handgun bullets, it \nis not designed to withstand the high-velocity bullets described above; assault rifles therefore \n\"readily penetrate\" such body armor. (D.I. 42 at 55). \nOther dangerous characteristics abound. One is rate of fire. Although it is true that, unlike \na fully automatic weapon, an assault weapon can \"only fire as often as a person can pull its trigger\" \n(Gray Br. at 6), Defendants provide evidence of numerous, inexpensive products, available for \npurchase in most states, that allow AR-style rifles to fire at rates comparable to fully automatic \nweapons. (D.I. 37 at 14-15; D.I. 54 at 90 (describing one $49 trigger system that allows users to \n22 shoot at 900 rounds per minute)). Another is range. Assault rifles are designed for long-range use \n(D.I. 42 at 49), and therefore \"allow criminals to effectively engage law enforcement officers from \ngreat distances .\" (D.I. 37 at 22 (quoting Kolbe v. Hogan, 849 F.3d 114, 127 (4th Cir. 2017), \nabrogated by Bruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111)). This feature, in combination with the exceptional lethality \nof assault rifle bullets described above, \"has led to multiple incidents in which criminals outgun \npolice.\" (Id). \nIn sum, I find that Defendants have sufficientl y established that assault long guns and \nLCMs implicate dramatic technological change and unprecedented societal concerns for public \nsafety. \nThe next step is to review Defendants ' evidence of historical regulations , determine \nwhether the regulations at issue impose comparable burdens on the right to armed self-defense, \nand decide whether the burdens imposed are comparably justified. \nDefendants offer multiple historical analogues , including several from the Nation's early \nhistory. One notable example concerns the Bowie knife. The Bowie knife-a distinctive long\u00ad\nbladed knife popularized by the adventurer Jim Bowie after he supposedl y used it in a brawl\u00ad\nproliferated beginning in the 1830s. (D.I. 40 at 11). The \"craze\" for these knives led to their \nwidespread use in fights, duels, and other criminal activities , as single-shot pistols tended to be \nunreliable and inaccurate. (Id at 11-12). Bowie knives became known for these nefarious uses (id \nat 12-13), and as violent crime increased during the early nineteenth century, states responded with \nanti-knife legislation. (Id at 13-14). These regulations were \"extensive and ubiquitous. \" (Id. at \n17). Between 1837 and 1925, twenty-nine states enacted laws to bar Bowie knife concealed carry. \n(Id. at 16). Fifteen states barred their carry altogether. (Id.). \n23 Other melee weapons were subject to similar regulations during the nineteenth and early \ntwentieth centuries. Starting in 1862, many states targeted the billy club--a heavy, hand-held club \ntraditionally carried by police. (Id. at 8). Fourteen states enacted anti-billy club laws in the 1800s; \neleven did so in the early 1900s. (Id.). Many states also regulated (and sometimes outlawed) the \n\"slungshot ,\" a weapon developed circa the 1840s that was widely used by criminals and as a \nfighting implement , and which had a \"dubious reputation \" on account of its ease of construction \nand ability to be used silently. (Id. at 9). Forty-three states enacted nearly eighty anti-slungshot \nlaws between 1850 and 1900. (Id.). \nAfter the Civil War, revolver pistols-which were used only sparingly during the war\u00ad\nentered the civilian market. (Id. at 25-26). The increased availability of these guns contributed to \nescalating interpersonal violence. (Id. at 27). States reacted with a \"rapid spread\" of concealed \ncarry restrictions. (Id.). By the end of the 1800s, nearly every state in the country had such laws \n(id.), and, by the early 1900s, at least six states barred possession of these weapons outright. (Id. \nat 28). \nFully automatic firearms entered the scene during World War I. (D.I. 40 at 29). After the \nwar, one such firearm that had been developed for military use-the Thompson submachine gun, \nwidely known as the Tommy gun-became available for civilian purchase. (Id.). Initially, it was \nunregulated. (Id.). Once the Tommy gun began to circulate in society, however, its \"uniquely \ndestructive capabilities \" became clear, especially once it found favor among gangster \norganizations during Prohibition. (Id. at 31 ). Although the Tommy gun and like firearms \"were \nactually used relatively infrequently by criminals , when they were used, they exacted a devastating \ntoll and garnered extensive national attention, such as their use in the infamous St. Valentine 's \nDay massacre in Chicago in 1929.\" (Id.). States reacted by passing anti-machine gun laws (id. at \n24 35), as well as laws restricting ammunition feeding devices, or guns that could accommodate them, \nbased on set limits on the number of rounds. (Id. at 48). Finally, in 1934, Congress enacted the \nNational Firearms Act, which imposed strict regulations on the civilian acquisition and circulation \nof fully automatic weapons. (Id. at 36). The National Firearms Act also imposed strict requirements \non the acquisition and circulation of short-barreled shotguns-shotguns with barrels less than 18 \ninches long-as these weapons widened the spray of fire and caused \"devastating \" effects when \nused at close range. (Id.). \nPlaintiffs urge me to disregard machine gun regulations as irrelevant , as those regulations \nare temporally remote from the adoption of the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. (D.I. 44 at \n18). Plaintiffs rely on the Court's statement in Bruen that such evidence isn't helpful \"when it \ncontradicts earlier evidence. \" 142 S. Ct. at 2154. But these later regulations are consistent with the \nearlier regulations that Defendants provide. As Defendants emphasized at oral argument (D.I. 54 \nat 129), the historical record that Defendants present, when viewed as a whole, illustrates a pattern: \n\"[F]irearms and accessories , along with other dangerous weapons, were subject to remarkably \nstrict and wide-ranging regulation when they entered society, proliferated , and resulted in violence, \nharm, or contributed to criminality .\" (D.I. 40 at 4). The analogous twentieth-century regulations \ndo not depart from this pattern, and, indeed, reinforce it. Therefore , I decline to disregard them. \nSee Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2136-37 (recognizing that later history may be relevant where a practice \nhas been \"open, widespread, and unchallenged since the early days of the Republic .... \"). \nEven ifl were to consider evidence from the twentieth century, argue Plaintiffs , none of \nthe purported analogous regulations that Defendants offer are \"relevantly similar.\" (D.I. 44 at 7-\n8). Plaintiffs' primary argument is that those regulations targeted weapons that are meaningfully \ndifferent from those addressed by the statutes at issue here. (See id.). Specifically , Plaintiffs say \n25 that, in contrast to assault weapons and LCMs, the arms addressed by these historical regulations \nwere \"perceived at the time to be almost exclusively used by criminals.\" (Id. at 42). Plaintiffs \nprovide no citation for this assertion, and I am not sure that the record supports it. Although the \nrecord reflects that criminality was an overriding concern driving historical weapons regulations \n(e.g., D.I. 40 at 33-34 (Tommy guns); id. at 13 (Bowie knives)), the record also shows that some \nof the regulated weapons circulated appreciably before they were restricted. For instance, as \nDefendants stressed at oral argument (see D.I. 54 at 127), the record demonstrates that Bowie \nknives proliferated in civil society.15 (D.I. 40 at 11-12). Furthermore, although Plaintiffs \ncharacterize Tommy guns as having been \"overwhelmingly put to use by criminals and gangsters \" \n(D.I. 54 at 19-20), this is not what the record reflects. The Tommy gun was rarely used by \ncriminals. (D.I. 40 at 31). Its association with criminal activity was the product of the public's \ngrowing awareness of devastating , high-profile shooting incidents, as well as the rise of lurid and \nsensational news reports covering gun crime. (Id. at 33-34). I am therefore unconvinced that the \nhistorical regulations under discussion regulated weapons that are relevantly different than those \nat issue here by virtue of their criminality. \nI think that, to the contrary, these historical regulations are \"relevantly similar\" to the \nregulations at issue in the two \"central\" respects identified by the Supreme Court: they impose \ncomparable burdens on the right of armed self-defense , and those burdens are comparably justified. \n15 This evidence casts some doubt on Plaintiffs' argument-which is also unsupported-that none \nof the arms targeted by these historical regulations could have been considered in common use for \nlawful purposes . (D.I. 54 at 41). Indeed, it would be hard to imagirte that there was a more useful \nweapon for self-defense in the 1830s than a Bowie knife. Those who carried such weapons claimed \nto do so for self-defense, although they weren't always believed. For instance, in 1834, a grand \njury in Jasper County, Georgia bemoaned \"the practice which is common amongst us with the \nyoung the middle aged and the aged to arm themselves with Pistols, dirks knives sticks & spears \nunder the specious pretence of protecting themselves against insult, when in fact being so armed \nthey frequently insult others with impunity .... \" (D.I. 40 at 12) (emphasis added). \n26 Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2132-33. First, both sets ofregulations impose a \"comparable burden.\" Indeed, \nthe burden that the challenged regulations impose is slight. This is where Defendants ' suitability \narguments-which I dismissed in supra Section III.A.1-become relevant. As discussed , \nDefendants have shown that LCMs with more than 17 rounds are \"unnecessary for self-defense ,\" \nas individuals in self-defense situations rarely fire even 10 rounds (D.I. 37 at 19), and the record \ndoes not reflect that any firearms require LCMs to operate. (D.I. 48 at 1). Defendants have shown \nthe same with respect to assault weapons, which, too, are rarely used defensively . (D.I. 37 at 19). \nFurthermore , some of the historical regulations are broader than the challenged statutes. For \nexample, multiple nineteenth-century laws regulating melee weapons were blanket restrictions on \nthe carry of entire categories of weapons. (D.I. 40 at 13 (noting laws \"barring the category or type \nof knife embodied by the Bowie knife but without mentioning them by name\")). HB 450, by \ncontrast, is not a categorical ban; the \"assault long guns\" it prohibits are specifically enumerated. \n11 Del. C. \u00a7 1465(2). Accordingly , I find that the LCM and assault long gun restrictions of HB \n450 and SS 1 for SB 6 do not impose a greater burden on the right of armed self-defense than did \nanalogous historical regulations. \nSecond, the burden imposed by both sets of regulations is \"comparably justified.\" The \nmodem regulations at issue, like the historical regulations discussed by Defendants , were enacted \nin response to pressing public safety concerns regarding weapons determined to be dangerous. HB \n450 and SS 1 for SB 6 responded to a recent rise in mass shooting incidents, the connection \nbetween those incidents and assault weapons and LCMs, and the destructive nature of those \nweapons. See HB 450. Plaintiffs argue that these concerns are improper for me to consider, as they \n\"implicate the sort of interest-balancing , means-end analysis\" that the Supreme Court instructed \nlower courts not to undertake . (D.I. 44 at 8). I disagree. Although the Bruen Court rejected means-\n27 ends scrutiny, it nevertheless advised lower courts to, in determining whether modem and \nhistorical regulations are \"relevantly similar,\" consider \"how and why the regulations burden a \nlaw-abiding citizen's right to self-defense. \" 142 S. Ct. at 2132-33 (emphasis added). See Oregon \nFirearms Fed'n, Inc. v. Brown, 2022 WL 1745829, at *14 (D. Or. Dec. 6, 2022) (\"In considering \nwhether Defendants are comparativel y justified in imposing Measure 114 as were this Nation's \nearlier legislatures in imposing historical regulations , this Court finds that it may consider the \npublic safety concerns of today.\"), appeal voluntaril y dismissed, No. 22-36011 (9th Cir. Dec. 12, \n2022).16 Accordingly , I find that Defendants are comparably justified in regulating assault long \nguns and LCMs \"to ensure the safety of Delawareans. \" HB 450. \nFor these reasons, I find that the LCM and assault long gun prohibitions ofHB 450 and SS \n1 for SB 6 are consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Plaintiffs have \ntherefore failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their Second Amendment \nclaim. \nB. Irreparable Harm \nI proceed to the issue of irreparable harm. 17 In addition to demonstrating a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction must also demonstrate that they \nwill suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief. Reilly, 858 F.3d at 179. This \nrequirement demands a showing that irreparable harm is \"more likely than not. \" Id. Deprivations \nof constitutional rights often-but do not always-amount to \"irreparable harm.\" See 11 CHARLES \n16 I note that the public safety concerns motivating the challenged regulations are also relevant to \ndetermining whether the regulations \"implicat[ e] unprecedented societal concerns or dramatic \ntechnological changes.\" Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2132. \n17 I address this issue for thoroughness only. As Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden for likelihood \nof success on the merits, a finding of irreparable harm cannot help Plaintiffs here. Both factors are \nrequired for a preliminary injunction . See Reilly, 858 F.3d at 179. \n28 ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 2948.1 (3d ed. \n2022) (\"When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved ... most courts hold that \nno further showing of irreparable harm is necessary. \"). Although First Amendment deprivations , \neven for \"minimal periods of time,\" are presumed to be irreparable injuries, Elrod v. Burns, 427 \nU.S. 347, 373 (1976), neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit have explicitly extended \nthat holding to the Second Amendment. See Rohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 73 (3d Cir. 1989) \n(\"Constitutional harm is not necessarily synonymous with the irreparable harm necessary for \nissuance of a preliminary injunction .\"); see also Lanin v. Borough of Tenafly, 515 F. App'x 114, \n118 (3d Cir. 2013) (reiterating Rohe holding with respect to irreparable harm). Thus, counter to \nPlaintiffs' assertions (Gray Br. at 11; DSSA Br. at 18), an alleged deprivation of a Second \nAmendment right does not automatically constitute irreparable harm. The two Third Circuit cases \nupon which Plaintiffs rely do not suggest otherwise. See KA. ex rel. Ayers v. Pocono Mountain \nSch. Dist., 710 F.3d 99, 113 (3d Cir. 2013) (First Amendment); Lewis v. Kugler, 446 F.2d 1343, \n1350 (3d Cir. 1971) (search and seizure claim). \nPlaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of proving irreparable harm in the absence of a \npreliminary injunction. Plaintiffs claim several injuries. (D.I. 21, 22, 26, 27). First, Plaintiffs say \nthat they will suffer irreparable harm because HB 450 and SS 1 for SB 6 prevent Plaintiffs from \npossessing and obtaining assault weapons and LCMs \"for self-defense and other lawful purposes,\" \nin violation of their Second Amendment rights. (D.I. 21 at pp. 2-3; D.I. 22 at pp. 2-3; D.I. 27 at p. \n2). But Plaintiffs retain ample effective alternatives , especially with respect to the \"core\" purpose \nof self-defense. As Defendants said at oral argument (e.g., D.I. 54 at 81-82), HB 450 regulates \nonly a subset of semi-automatic weapons. These weapons are seldom used for self-defense (D.I. \n38 at 15), perhaps because they are ill-suited to the task. (D.I. 42 at 49-54). Unaffected by HB 450 \n29 are numerous other firearms, including handguns -the \"quintessential self-defense weapon.\" \nBruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2143. LCMs are not useful for self-defense either. See supra Section III.A.1.b. \nNotably, Plaintiffs are not aware of any firearms that come with a magazine holding over 17 rounds \nthat cannot also be operated using a smaller magazine.18 (D.I. 48 at 1). Plaintiffs have furnished \nno evidence that that they cannot adequately defend themselves without the regulated weapons, \nor, indeed, that their ability to self-defend has been meaningfully diminished. Consequently, I am \nnot convinced that an inability to possess or to obtain assault weapons or LCMs for self-defense \nand other lawful purposes constitutes irreparable harm. \nSecond, Plaintiffs say that the challenged statutes are irreparably harming them because \nthe statutes restrict their ability to sell assault weapons and LCMs, resulting in lost business \nopportunities. (D.I. 22 at pp. 3, 4; D.I. 26 at pp. 2-3). Defendant argues that these injuries are not \nirreparable. (D.I. 37 at 47). I agree. As the Third Circuit has recognized, no court has held \"that \nthe Second Amendment secures a standalone right to sell guns or range time.\" Drummond v. \nRobinson Township , 9 F.4th 217, 230 (3d Cir. 2021). Furthermore, Plaintiffs have adduced no \nevidence that they are likely to incur significant business losses absent a preliminary injunction ; \nPlaintiffs remain free to sell the multitude of firearms that are unaffected by the challenged statutes. \nThus, I am not convinced by this argument either. I therefore conclude that Plaintiffs have failed \nto meet the irreparable harm requirement for a preliminary injunction. \n18 Plaintiffs mention that \"common arms that come equipped with standard-capacity magazines of \n17 rounds of ammunition or below are still banned under SS 1 for SB 6,\" as \"ammunition \nmagazines can often be used for multiple calibers and the number of rounds they can hold depends \non the caliber.\" (D.I. 48 at 1 n.l; see also DSSA Br. at 9-10; D.I. 44 at 16 (explaining same)). \nPlaintiffs do not, however, go on to explain how many weapons are thus affected. As I do not think \nthat Plaintiffs have adequately developed this argument , I do not address it here. \n30 I now turn to the remaining preliminary injunction factors: the balance of the equities and \nthe public interest. I consider these two factors only if the movant \"meet[ s] the threshold for the \nfirst two 'most critical' factors: it must demonstrate that it can win on the merits ... and that it is \nmore likely than not to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.\" Reilly, 858 \nF.3d at 179. As Plaintiffs have not met the threshold for either of the first two factors, I need not \nproceed to the second two. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction are DENIED. \nIV.
