District Judg . \nPlaintiff John R. Purnell, Ill, who proceeds prose, filed this action alleging \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(k)(1 ), and the Fourteenth \nAmendment. (0.1. 1). Before the Court are Defendants ' motion to dismiss and motion \nto set aside default and Plaintiffs motion to strike and motion to amend. (0.1. 26, 33, \n42, 48). Briefing is complete. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis action concerns a complaint filed by the Delaware Department of Insurance \nagainst Plaintiff alleging that he and his bail bond company , Bail Bond Agency, Inc., had \nviolated certain provisions of the Delaware Insurance Code and no longer met the \ncriteria for issuance of a license following which his license was revoked. (0.1. 1; see \n0.1. 27-4 at 2-7). As alleged, Plaintiff \"was a licensed bail producer and general agent \nfor the State of Delaware Department of Insurance. \" (0.1. 1 at 3). Plaintiff received a \nnotice of revocation from Defendant Delaware Department of Insurance in September \n2015. (Id. at 4, 6). \nPlaintiff alleges that \"all\" Defendants \"entered a conspiracy to revoke his bail \nproducer/agent license at the direction of [Bankers] who was disgruntled because of \nforfeitures arising in New Jersey.\" (Id. at 13). A hearing was held on February 17, \n2016. (Id. at 7; see 0.1. 27-1 at 2). Defendant Jessica Willey represented the \nDepartment of Insurance during the hearing and Defendant Noel Eason Primos, the \nhearing officer, presided. (0.1. 1 at 9; 0.1. 27-4 at 2-7). Primos issued recommended \nfindings, and recommended to Defendant Weldin Stewart, the Delaware Commissioner \nof Insurance , that she find Purnell violated the Insurance Code and that the \n1 Commissioner \"immediately revoke\" Plaintiff's license. (0.1. 27-1 at 10). On September \n26, 2016, the Commissioner adopted the bulk of the hearing officer's recommended \nfindings and revoked Plaintiff's license and imposed a fine. (0.1. 27-4 at 2-7). Plaintiff \nappealed to the Superior Court of the State of Delaware and, on Septembe r 7, 2017, \nthe Superior Court affirmed that portion of the Commissioner 's decision that revoked \nPlaintiff's license and reversed the assessed fine. (See 0.1. 4-1 at 2-32). Plaintiff \nappealed to the Delaware Supreme Court, and on May 30, 2018, the Supreme Court \naffirmed the Superior Court's judgment. See Purnell v. Delaware Dep't of Ins., 2018 WL \n2435554, at *1 (Del. May 30, 2018). Reargument was denied on July 5, 2018. Id. \nOn August 3, 2018, Plaintiff improperly removed the Delaware Supreme Court \ncase for this Court to review the Supreme Court's July 5, 2018 opinion. See Purnell v. \nDelaware Dep't of Ins., Civ. No. 18-1160-RGA (D. Del.). The removed case was \nsummarily remanded to State Court on November 19, 2018. See id. at 0.1. 5, 6 (D. Del. \nNov. 19, 2018). On November 29, 2018, the Clerk of the Delaware Supreme Court \nadvised Plaintiff that no further action would be taken. (0.1. 27-10 at 2). Plaintiff filed \nthis action on August 11, 2020. (0.1. 1). \nDefendants Delaware Department of Insurance , Karen Weldin-Stewart , Noel \nEason Primos, Jessica Willey, Robin David, Nicole Holecek, and Frank Pyle (\"State \nDefendants \") move for dismissal on the grounds that the complaint is time-barred , \nPlaintiff failed to effect service of process, and they are immune from suit. (0.1. 26). \nPlaintiff was given a deadline until on or before September 9, 2021 to file an answering \nbrief or respond to the motion. (0.1. 31). He did not. \n2 On August 12, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiff's request for entry of default and \nthe Clerk entered default against Defendants Lexitas, Next Gen, and Wilcox & Fetzer \nLtd. the same day. (0.1. 29, 30). In turn, Deposition Solutions , LLC filed a motion to set \naside the entry of default. (0.1. 33). Plaintiff responded by filing a motion to strike sham \npleading and an answering brief. (D.I. 42, 44). On December 3, 2021, Plaintiff filed a \nmotion for leave to file an amended complaint. (0.1. 48). \nII. MOTION TO DISMISS \nA. Legal Standards \nBecause Plaintiff proceeds prose, his pleading is liberally construed and his \ncomplaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a \ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Although \ngenerally a court may only consider the contents of the complaint on a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss, \"a court may consider certain narrowly defined types of material \nwithout converting the motion\" to one for summary judgment. In re Rockefeller Ctr. \nProps. Sec. Litig., 184 F.3d 280,287 (3d Cir. 1999). Courts may consider documents \n\"integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint ,\" In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. \nLitig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997); or matters of public record, Chugh v. \nWestern Inventory Servs., Inc., 333 F. Supp. 2d 285, 289 (D.N.J. 2004). \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must \naccept the factual allegations as true. Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 \n(2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \n3 pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 545. Factual allegations do not have to be detailed, \nbut must provide more than labels, conclusions , or a \"formulaic recitation \" of the claim \nelements . Id. \nMoreover , there must be enough factual matter to state a facially plausible claim \nto relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is \nsatisfied when the complaint 's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. \nB. Discussion \nPlaintiff raises a claims against State Defendants alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1985(3), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(k)(1 ), and the Fourteenth Amendment. State \nDefendants move for dismissal on the grounds that the claims are time-barred. (D.I. \n27). \nPersonal injury statute of limitations are applied to \u00a7 1985(3) violations and \nclaims that arise under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.1 See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 \n(1985); Bougherv . University of Pittsburgh , 882 F.2d 74, 79-80 (3d Cir. 1989). In \nDelaware , personal injury claims are subject to a two-year limitations period. See 10 \nDel. C. \u00a7 8119. Although state law determines the applicable limitations period for \nclaims under\u00a7 1985 and \u00a7 1983, federal law governs a cause of action's accrual date. \nSee Genty v. Resolution Trust Corp., 937 F.2d 899, 919 (3d Cir. 1991 ). Claims under\u00a7 \n1985(3) and \u00a7 1983 accrue when the plaintiff \"knew or should have known of the \n1 Allegations that State Defendants violated the Fourteenth Amendment arise under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) (when bringing a\u00a7 1983 \nclaim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a federal right, and \nthat the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law). \n4 alleged civil rights violation.\" Baugher, 882 F.2d at 80. Generally, \"[t]he determination \nof the time at which a claim accrues is an objective inquiry; we ask not what the plaintiff \nactually knew but what a reasonable person should have known.\" Kach v. Hose, 589 \nF.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir. 2009). \nPlaintiff filed his Complaint on August 11, 2020. (0.1. 1 ). State Defendants argue \nthat Plaintiffs injury occurred on February 17, 2016, the date of the revocation hearing. \n(0.1. 27 at 10). They also argue that even if the Court uses September 26, 2016, the \ndate that the final decision and order was issued, it still is well outside the two-year \nstatute of limitations. (Id.). \nPlaintiff did not timely file the claims against State Defendants . It is clear that the \n\u00a7 1985(3) and \u00a7 1983 claims against State Defendants are time-barred since the \nComplaint was filed well outside the two-year limitation period. \nState Defendants also move for dismissal of the claims raised under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2000e-2(k) , Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII provides that it shall be an \nunlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an individual \nbased upon race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Id. As discussed by State \nDefendants , the Title VII claim does not apply since Plaintiff does not allege that he was \nemployed by the State of Delaware or that he ever sought employment with the State. \nAdditionally , there is nothing to suggest that Plaintiff filed a complaint of discrimination \nwith the EEOC as is required when raising Title VII claims. See Clarkson v. SEPTA, \n700 F. App'x 111 (3d Cir. 2017). The Court will thus dismiss the Title VII claims. \n5 Accordingly , State Defendants ' motion to dismiss will be granted.2 (0.1. 26). \nIll. MOTION TO SET ASIDE ENTRY OF DEFAULT \nThe Clerk entered default against Wilcox & Fetzer Ltd., Lexitas, and Next Gen on \nAugust 12, 2021. (0.1. 30). On October 21, 2021, Deposition Solutions , LLC filed a \nmotion to set aside the entry of default on behalf of the defaulted Defendants. (0.1. 33). \nPlaintiff opposes and moves to strike the \"sham pleading.\" (0.1. 42). \nDeposition Solutions explains that it filed the motion on behalf of Lexitas, Next \nGen, and Wilcox & Fetzer because the Complaint names trade names rather than \nentities, as follows: \n\"Lexitas\" is a trade name used by Deposition Solutions, LLC and is not a \ncorporate entity with the capacity to be sued. See [0.1. 34-1], at ,I 2. \n\"Next Gen\" is ambiguous. It may refer to assets purchased by Deposition \nSolutions in an asset purchase from Next Generation Reporting , LLC in \nOctober 2017 or it may refer to the specific entity. Next Generation \nReporting , LLC is not and never has been owned or operated by \nDeposition Solutions , LLC. To the extent the latter is the entity Plaintiff \nintended to sue, Deposition Solutions , LLC does not make these \narguments on its behalf. \n\"Wilcox & Fetzer\" appears to refer to a trade name that may not have the \ncapacity to be sued. Deposition Solutions , LLC does not have knowledge \nof that entity's corporate history, other than that Deposition Solutions , LLC \npurchased certain assets from Next Generation Reporting, LLC in October \n2017, including the right to use the Wilcox & Fetzer name. In that \npurchase , Deposition Solutions did not agree to assume any liabilities, \nwhether related to Wilcox & Fetzer or Next Generation Reporting , LLC. \nTo the extent Plaintiff intended to bring a claim against Deposition \nSolutions , LLC based on its purchase of these assets, Deposition \nSolutions , LLC's response is limited only to the interest it acquired in the \nasset purchase. \n2 Because the claims against State Defendants are time-barred and non-cognizable , the \nCourt will not address the other grounds for dismissal raised by State Defendants. \n6 (D.I. 34 at 5 n.1). \nDeposition Solutions moves to set aside the entry of default on the grounds that it \nwas unaware that the lawsuit had been filed because it was not named as a defendant , \nwas not served and, therefore , did not respond to the Complaint. It notes that the \nreturns of service are not related to any named defendant. Rather, they are to \nDeposition Solutions , LLC Ua (i.e., trading as) Wilcox & Fetzer, Lexitas Reporting , and \nNextGen Reporting . (See D.I. 7, 10, 11 ). Deposition Solutions indicates that its \nregistered agent apparently accepted service of process, but Deposition Solutions has \nno record of receiving mailed service. Finally, it indicates that it became aware of the \nlawsuit only when it received a copy of Plaintiffs undated notice of entry of default. \nPlaintiff opposes and states that Deposition Solutions , LLC is not the true party in \ninterest; rather it is Depo Holdings , LLC. He argues that the Complaint and summons \nwere properly served and Defendants had adequate notice of the action. He further \nargues that Deposition Solutions has no standing. Plaintiff moves to strike the motion \n(D.I. 42) and argues that Deposition Solutions and the law firm of Farnan LLP are \nfictitious names and, therefore , are governed by 6 Del. C. \u00a7 3101 et seq. Plaintiffs \nmotion to strike will be denied. \nAn entry of default may be vacated upon a showing of \"good cause,\" Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 55(c), Bhimnathwa/a v. Judiciary of State of New Jersey, Fam. Div., 858 F. App'x \n558, 560 (3d Cir. 2021 ), cert. denied sub nom. Bhimnathwala v. New Jersey State \nJudiciary , 142 S. Ct. 712 (2021). The decision to vacate the default entry is committed \nto the discretion of the trial court. See United States v. $55,518.05 in U.S. Currency, \n728 F.2d 192, 194 (3d Cir. 1984). In the Third Circuit, default judgments are disfavored \n7 as they prevent claims from being decided on the merits. Id. Even in close cases, \n\"doubts should be resolved in favor of setting aside the default and reaching the merits.\" \nZawadski de Bueno v. Bueno Castro, 822 F.2d 416,420 (3d Cir. 1987). When \nconsidering a decision to set aside the entry of default, the Court should consider the \nfollowing factors: (1) whether Plaintiff will be prejudiced if the Court sets aside the \ndefault; (2) whether Defendants have a meritorious defense; and (3) whether the default \nwas a result of Defendants ' culpable conduct. See $55,518.05, 728 F.2d at 194. \nDeposition Solution asserts there is at least one meritorious defense -Plaintiffs \nclaims are time barred and Plaintiff cannot meet his burden to show vicarious liability. \nThe meritorious-defense factor is considered the \"threshold issue\" in setting aside a \ndefault. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Starlight Ballroom Dance Club, Inc., 175 F. App'x \n519, 522 (3d Cir. 2006). The standard requires a defendant to \"set forth with some \nspecificity the grounds for his defense.\" Nationwide , 175 F. App'x at 522. \"The showing \nof a meritorious defense is accomplished when 'allegations of defendant 's answer, if \nestablished on trial, would constitute a complete defense to the action.\"' $55,518.05, \n728 F.2d at 195 (quoting Tozer v. Charles A. Krause Mill. Co., 189 F.2d 242, 244 (3d \nCir. 1951 )). The expiration of the statute of limitations is a meritorious defense. \nPlaintiff claims that he will be prejudiced should the entry of default be set aside \nas he \"suffers daily for the lost ability to earn income from his trade and business , \nsuffered and continues to suffer the financial loss, mental anguish, and security of his \nhome loss due to Defendant's' actions and omissions. \" (0.1. 44 at 4, 12). He contends \nthe \"defendant knowingly , intentionally, and maliciously destroyed evidence needed to \neffectively assert multiple claims during, at, and after the revocation of [his] State bail \n8 producer's license.\" (Id. at 12). And, he argues 'the destruction of the audio recording \nof the revocation hearing before the finality of the case(s) below constituted spoliation of \nevidence .\" (Id.). \n\"Prejudice is established ... when a plaintiffs ability to pursue the claim has \nbeen hindered by, for example, loss of available evidence, increased potential for fraud \nor collusion, or substantial reliance upon the judgment.\" Nationwide, 175 F. App'x at \n523 (cleaned up). \"Delay in realizing satisfaction on a claim rarely serves to establish a \nsufficient degree of prejudice.\" Id. Here, Plaintiffs assertion of prejudice rests upon the \nrecovery of alleged financial loss and loss of available evidence. As to recovery of \nfinancial loss, that, in itself, is insufficient to establish prejudice. The allegations of \ndestruction of evidence fare no better in establishing prejudice . Plaintiffs complaint \nalleges that Wilcox & Fetzer were complicit in the conspiracy to destroy the audio record \nof the hearing \"before the time of appellate review elapsed.\" (0.1. 1 at 13). The \nComplaint alleges that Plaintiff has email evidence with Wilcox & Fetzer regarding the \ndestruction of the audio recording. Plaintiffs appeal before the New Castle County \nSuperior Court was ruled upon on September 7, 2017, and he was informed by the \nDelaware Supreme Court on November 28, 2018, that it would take no further action his \ncase. (0.1. 21 at 2; 0.1. 27-10 at 2). Both these events occurred two to three years prior \nto Plaintiffs filing of this lawsuit on August 11, 2020. Since his claim is that Wilcox and \nFetzer destroyed an audio recording before he filed suit, there can be no relevant \nprejudice to Plaintiff from delay in this case when the evidence at issue did not exist \nwhen Plaintiff commenced this action. \n9 Finally, the record does not support a finding of culpable conduct. To show \nculpable conduct, \"more than mere negligence must be demonstrated .\" Nationwide , \n175 F. App'x at 523 (cleaned up). Cases where courts have found a lack of culpability \n\"typically involved innocent mishaps or mere mistakes. \" Id. (collecting cases). The \nrecord reflects that Deposition Solution was unaware of the lawsuit and, when it \ndiscovered its existence, took immediate action. (See D.I. 34-1 at 2-4). \nHaving reviewed all the factors, I conclude that it is appropriate to set aside the \nentry of default. Therefore , the motion to set aside entry of default will be granted. \nIV. MOTION TO AMEND \nPlaintiff moves for leave to file an amended complaint to add parties, to reflect \nthe allegations against the new parties, and to amplify some of the original allegations . \n(D.I. 48). Local Rule 15.1 provides that a party who moves to amend a pleading shall \nattach to the motion: (1) the proposed pleading as amended , complete with a \nhandwritten or electronic signature ; and (2) a form of the amended pleading which \nindicates in what respect it differs from the pleading which it amends, by bracketing or \nstriking through materials to be deleted and underlining materials to be added. Plaintiff \ndid not do this, and did not come close to doing this. \nTherefore , Plaintiff's motion to amend will be denied without prejudice to renew \nupon compliance with the Local Rules of this Court. \nV. CONCLUSION \nBased upon the above discussion , the Court will: (1) grant State Defendants ' \nmotion to dismiss; (2) grant the motion to set aside entry of default against Wilcox & \n10 Fetzer Ltd., Lexitas, and Next Gen; (3) deny Plaintiff's motion to strike; and (4) deny \nwithout prejudice to renew Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n11 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJOHN R.
