Civil Action No. 18-174-LPS\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondent.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nAt Wilmington this 28th day of December, 2021;\n1. On November 12, 2020, the Court denied Petitioner Earl Bradley\u2019s Petition for Writ of\nHabeas Corpus Filed Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. (D.I. 27; D.I. 28)\n2. On December 4, 2020, Petitioner filed in this Court a document titled \u201cMotion for\n\nExtension of Time to File Objections and Request for Articulation Motions\u201d (D.I. 29) and a\n\ndocument titled \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Denial of Certificate of Appealability and Motion\nfor Extension of Time to File Issues on Which COA is Being Sought and Argument\u201d (D.I. 30).\nNeither of these Motions contains substantive arguments.\n\n3. Also on December 4, 2020, Petitioner filed in this Court a Notice of Appeal to the Third\n\nCircuit concerning the November 12, 2020 denial of his \u00a7 2254 Petition. (D.I. 31)\n\n4, On December 11, 2020, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued an Order staying\nPetitioner\u2019s appeal until this Court\u2019s disposition of \u201ca timely post-decision motion of the type\nspecified by Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).\u201d (D.1 33)\n\n5. On December 14, 2020, Petitioner filed in this Court a \u201cMotion to Enter Correction and\n\nFurther Clarifications Regarding the Motion of 12/4/20.\u201d (D.L 34) The Motion is captioned for\nthe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and asserts that his Fourth Amendment claims were\nimproperly denied. (D.I 34 at 1-7) The Motion to Enter Cortection alternatively requests a\ncertificate of appealability with respect to the Fourth Amendment claims that were denied. (D.I. 34\nat 7)\n\n6. On December 16, 2020, Petitioner filed in this Court a \u201cMotion for Certificate of\nAppealability and Statement of Reasons Why A Certificate Should Issue.\u201d (D.I. 35) The Motion for\nCertificate of Appealability is captioned for the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and asserts\nthat this Court erred in declining to issue a certificate of appealability with respect to the denial of\nthe following three arguments that wete presented in Petitioner\u2019s habeas Petition: (1) Petitioner was\ndenied his Sixth Amendment right to choice of counsel; (2) the trial court erroneously relied on\ninformation from outside the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the affidavit/warrant, and defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to present this argument during Petitioner\u2019s criminal proceeding; and\n(3) Petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment arguments ate not precluded by Stone \u00bb, Powell. (D.I. 35 at 2)\n\n7. On January 29, 2021, Petitioner filed in this Court a document titled \u201cMotion for\nWithdrawal or Cancellation of Motion for Extension of Time Filed on December 4, 2020.\u201d (D.I.\n37) In the \u201cMotion for Withdrawal or Cancellation\u201d Petitioner states: (a) he mistakenly believed he\nhad to file objections and a request for articulation; (b) \u201cThey will not be filed, thus [the] extension\nof time is moot\u201d; and (c) \u201cAt this time Petitioner should have no motions pending in [the] District\nCourt.\u201d (D.L 37)\n\n8. Given Petitioner\u2019s statement that there should be no motions pending in the District\nCourt, the Court construes the \u201cMotion for Withdrawal or Cancellation\u201d (D.I. 37) as Petitioner\u2019s\n\nrequest to withdraw all Motions then pending in this Court (other than the \u201cMotion for Withdrawal\n\not Cancellation\u201d), which ate entered as the following docket items: D.I. 29; D.I. 30; D.L 34; and D.I.\n35.\n\n9, The Court\u2019s interpretation of Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion for Withdrawal or Cancellation\u201d as a\ntequest to voluntarily withdraw the Motions presently pending in this Court is supported by a Status\nReport Petitioner filed on January 29, 2021 in his appeal pending before the Third Circuit. See\nBradley v. Warden, C.A. No. 20-3456, at D.I. 11 (3d Cir. Jan. 29, 2021). In that Status Report,\nPetitioner asserts that: (a) the December 14, 2020 filing for \u201cfurther clarification and certificate of\nappealability\u201d was mistakenly entered in the District Court; (b) \u201cAs of this date no District Court\nbusiness is pending\u201d; and (c) \u201cToday a motion to the District Court cancels the extension of time\nmotion.\u201d Id.\n\nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that:\n\n1. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion for Withdrawal or Cancellation of Motion for Extension of Time\nFiled on December 4, 2020,\u201d which the Court construes as a request to withdraw all Motions\npending before the Court as of January 29, 2021, is GRANTED. (D.L 37)\n\n2. Based on the foregoing, the following Motions are DISMISSED as voluntarily\n\nwithdrawn by Petitioner:\n\na. \u201cMotion for Extension of Time to File Objections and Request for Articulation\nMotions.\u201d (D.I. 29)\n\nb. \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Denial of Certificate of Appealability and\nMotion for Extension of Time to File Issues on Which COA is Being Sought\nand Argument.\u201d (D.I. 30)\n\nc. \u201cMotion to Enter Correction and Further Clarifications Regarding the Motion of\n12/4/20.\u201d (D.I. 34)\n\nd. \u201cMotion for Certificate of Appealability and Statement of Reasons Why A\nCertificate Should Issue.\u201d (D.I. 35)\n\n3\n10. Subsequent to filing the Motion for Withdrawal or Cancellation, Petitioner filed\nadditional motions in this Court. Specifically, on April 26, 2021, Petitioner filed a \u201cMotion for\nDistrict Court to Enter an Order Disposing of Any Remaining Rule 4(a)(4) Motions.\u201d (D.I. 40) In\nlight of the Coutt\u2019s ruling above, granting the Motion for Withdrawal or Cancellation, the April 26\nmotion (D.1. 40) is DENIED AS MOOT.\n\n11. On June 21, 2021, Petitioner filed a \u201cMotion for Appointment of Counsel.\u201d (D.I. 43)\nIn it, Petitioner writes: \u201cThis Motion seeks appointment of an attorney, but in the alternative this\nMotion should be dismissed along with any and all pending motions.\u201d (Id. at 1) As the Court is\ndismissing the other motions Petitioner seeks to dismiss, the Court likewise DISMISSES\nPetitioner\u2019s June 21 motion (D.I. 43).\n\n12. Finally, on September 16, 2021, Petitioner filed a \u201cMotion for this Court to Cortect Its\nBreach of Judicial Code of Conduct.\u201d (D.I. 45) In this Motion, Petitioner alleges that the Coutt\u2019s\ndelay in addressing his motions is a violation of various judicial canons. (See \u00e9d.) -As the Court has\n\nnow tuled on all matters pending before it in this action, Petitioner\u2019s September 16 motion (D.I. 45)\n\nis DENIED AS MOOT. 1.\n\nHONORABLE LEONARD P.
