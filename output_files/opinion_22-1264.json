{"case_name": "AOB Products Company v. Good Sportsman Marketing, LLC", "case_number": "22-1264", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "01-10-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAOB PRODUCTS COMP ANY, \nPlaintiff, \nV. C.A. No. 22-1264-GBW \nGOOD SPORTSMAN MARKETING , LLC, \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPending before the Court is Defendant Good Sportsman Marketing , LLC's (\"GSM\") \nMotion to Bifurcate (D .I. 18, the \"Motion\"), which has been fully briefed (D .I. 18, 19, 20). The \nCourt held oral argument on January 6, 2023. For the following reasons, the Motion is denied. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff AOB Products Company (\"AOB\") owns the federal trademark registrations for its \nTACK DRIVER , LEAD SLED, and DEADSHOT marks (collectively , the \"Asserted Marks\"). \nD.I. 1 ,r,r 72, 75-79. According to AOB, LEAD SLED is registered for \"shooting rests\" and \n\"weight bags, sold empty, for holding sand or other weighed materials , and used to stabilize gun \nrests,\" Id. ,r,r 75-76, TACK DRIVER is registered for \"support devices for firearms, namely, \nshooting bags,\" Id. ,r 77, and DEADSHOT is registered for \"support devices for firearms, namely, \nshooting bags\" and \"firearm attachments , namely, mounts for attaching accessories to a firearm; \nfirearm attachments , namely, mounts for use with monopods, bi pods, and tripods; support bases \nand accessory trays for shooting rests.\" Id. ,r,r 78-79. \nAdditionally , AOB owns the rights to U.S. Patent Nos. 10,317,162 (the'\" 162 patent\") and \n9,702,653 (the '\"653 patent\") directed to AOB's LEAD SLED shooting rest. Id. ,r,r 37-46. AOB explains that the LEAD SLED \"provides an innovative shooting rest that limits rearward \nmovement from the firearm when fired and reduces recoil felt by the shooter.\" Id. ,r 37. \nAOB alleges that GSM used the Asserted Marks without AOB's permission or authority \nby marketing its \"Lead Sled\" weight bags, \"TackDrive\" shooting rest bags and \"Tactical \nDeadshot\" shooting rest bag, id. ,r,r 19-21, 23, 26, 80, and that GSM's \"Alpha Shooting Rest\" \nproduct infringes claims of the '162 and '653 patents, id. ,r 49. As a result, AOB presently asserts \na seven-count Complaint consisting of federal claims of trademark counterfeiting (\"Count 1 \"), \ntrademark infringement (\"Count 2\"), false designation of origin and unfair competition (\"Count \n3\"), and patent infringement (\"Counts 6 and 7\"), as well as state law claims for deceptive trade \npractices and common law trademark infringement (\"Count 4\") and unfair competition (\"Count \n5\"). See generally D.I. 1. \nIn its Answer, GSM denied any trademark counterfeiting alleged in Count 1 (D.I. 16 ,r,r \n71-72), admitted to infringing AOB's Asserted Marks pursuant to Count 2 (Id. ,r,r 80-82), denied \nAOB's entitlement to damages for false designation of origin, unfair competition, deceptive trade \npractices, and state law trademark infringement alleged in Counts 3, 4, and 5 as \"based on the same \naccused conduct\" as the trademark infringement claim (Id. ,r,r 93, 97, 104-10), and denied any \npatent infringement alleged in Counts 6 and 7 (Id. ,r,r 111-146).1 When responding to AOB's \nprayer for relief, GSM admitted that \"the Court should enter an Order declaring that GSM infringed \nthe [Asserted] [M]arks from June/July 2021 to February 2022 under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 and \npermanently enjoin GSM and each of its officers, agents, servants, employees, parents, \n1 GSM also asserts four counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of non-infringement \nand invalidity related to the two patents-in-suit. D.I. 16 at 23-26. \n2 subsidiaries , affiliates, and those acting in active concert or participation with them from infringing \nthe [Asserted] [M]arks.\" Id. at 19-20. \nAccording to GSM, because GSM admitted to trademark infringement , only the issue of \ndamages remains to be adjudicated with respect to AOB's trademark claims. D.I. 18 at 1. As a \nresult, GSM contends that it proposed to AOB that the parties \"bifurcate the trademark \ninfringement claims from the remaining claims in suit, request the Court enter final judgment in \nfavor of AOB on the trademark infringement claims, and then set the trademark infringement \nclaims for a trial on damages if they could not reach agreement on the trademark infringement. \" \nId. at 3. AOB declined, stating that it \"will not settle the TM issues separately from the patent \nissues.\" D.I. 18-1. GSM filed the instant Motion requesting the relief to which AOB would not \nagree. D.I. 18. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(b) permits the Court to order a separate trial of one or \nmore separate issues \"[f]or convenience , to avoid prejudice , or to expedite and economize .... \" \nIf a party moves for bifurcation , it has the burden to establish that bifurcation \"is appropriate .\" \nSenoRx, Inc. v. Hologic, Inc., 920 F. Supp. 2d 565, 567 (D. Del. 2013) (citations omitted); Sprint \nCommc'ns Co. L.P. v. Charter Commc'ns, Inc., C.A. No. 17-1734-RGA, 2021 WL 982730, at *1 \n(D. Del. Mar. 16, 2021). The district court has \"broad discretion \" when it decides \"whether to \nseparate the issues(,]\" Idzojtic v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 456 F.2d 1228, 1230 (3d Cir. 1972); see \nThabault v. Chait, 541 F.3d 512, 529 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Idzojtic, 456 F.3d at 1230), though \n\"'bifurcation remains the exception rather than the rule.\"' Sprint, 2021 WL 982730, at* 1 ( citation \nomitted). The Court \"'should consider whether bifurcation will avoid prejudice , conserve judicial \nresources , and enhance juror comprehension .... \"' Id. ( citation omitted). \"In deciding whether \none trial or separate trials will best serve [the above factors] ... the major consideration is directed \n3 toward the choice most likely to result in a just final disposition of the litigation. \" In re Innotron \nDiagnostics , 800 F.2d 1077, 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1986). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nGSM, contending that \"there is no reason to delay resolution of damages on the trademark \nclaims,\" requests that the Court \"(1) bifurcate the trademark infringement and related claims, (2) \nenter final judgment on the trademark infringement claims in favor of AOB, and (3) separately set \nthe trademark infringement claims for a trial on damages.\" D.I. 18 at 1. In response, AOB argues \nthat GSM has not met its burden to demonstrate that bifurcation will avoid prejudice , conserve \njudicial resources, nor enhance juror comprehension. D.I. 19 at 8-12. The Court agrees with AOB. \nFirst, GSM has not shown that bifurcation would avoid prejudice. While GSM explains \nthat \"the parties will not face any inconvenience or prejudice, such as duplicative discovery\" \nbecause AOB's patent and trademark claims relate to different accused products, D.I. 18 at 5, AOB \nidentifies potentially overlapping witnesses involved in both sets of claims, as well as overlapping \nissues related to willful and intentional infringement , and the commercial success of AOB's \npatented products. D.I. 19 at 8-12.2 While GSM nevertheless maintains that the patent and \ntrademark issues have \"no relevance\" to each other and that any overlap would be \"minimal\", D.I. \n20 at 4-5, AOB presented at least one picture during oral argument that appeared to show the \nalleged infringing patent and trademark products are displayed and/or marketed together at least \n2 See Liqwd, Inc. v. L 'Orea! USA, Inc., C.A. No. 17-14-JFB-SRF, 2019 WL 365708, at *2 \n(D. Del. Jan. 30, 2019) (denying motion to bifurcate based on potentially overlapping evidence \nbetween claims and explaining that \"holding separate trials on L'Oreal's Lanham Act, false \npromise, breach of contract, and false marking counterclaims would result in prejudice to L' Oreal \nby requiring L'Oreal to present the same evidence at two separate trials.\"); Synopsys, Inc. v. \nMagma Design Automation , C.A. No. 05-701-GMS , 2006 WL 1452803, at *4 (D. Del. May 25, \n2006) ( declining to bifurcate antitrust claims from patent claims where \"the evidentiary \npresentation in one case would likely be substantiall y duplicative of the evidentiary presentation \nin the other.\"). \n4 m some stores. Moreover , it would be premature for the Court to make the evidentiary \ndetermination that the patent and trademark issues have \"no relevance\" to each other at this early \nstage of the case before any discovery has occurred. Further, GSM's complaint that AOB \"intends \nto weaponize the trademark infringement admission against GSM,\" D.I. 20 at 1, contemplates \nspeculative harm that could be cured by an evidentiary motion at the appropriate time rather than \nbifurcation now. SenoR.x, 920 F. Supp. 2d at 570; Sprint, 2021 WL 982730, at *1 (\"A significant \npart of Defendants ' argument concerns potential prejudice due to Plaintiffs use of prior litigation \nsuccesses that 'so permeate its damages and willfulness theories.' In their Motion for Summary \nJudgment, Defendants argue that such evidence is irrelevant and an unreliable source in calculating \ndamages. The Court is separately evaluating the merits of this argument and is excluding any \nevidence regarding prior litigation as to damages.\") . Thus, this factor does not support bifurcation. \nSecond, GSM has not shown that bifurcation would conserve judicial resources . GSM \nargues that \"bifurcation will expedite resolution of the trademark infringement and related claims\" \nbecause the action is in its \"early stage\" and GSM \"has admitted liability on trademark \ninfringement and agreed to a permanent injunction. \" D.I. 18 at 4. However, issues of liability \nappear unresolved as GSM specifically denies that it engaged in counterfeiting AOB's TACK \nDRIVER mark, D.I. 16 173, and specifically denies that its trademark infringement was willful \nand intentional , id. 1 27. While GSM maintains that \"the parties can easily litigate the issues of \ncounterfeiting and willfulness along with the damages phase of the trademark infringement \nclaims,\" D.I. 20 at 5, GSM cites to no authority condoning bifurcation simply because liability has \nbeen established on some, but not all, claims. Indeed, it appears that, rather than promote judicial \neconomy, GSM' s proposal would \"create additional work for everyone involved\" in light of the \npotentially duplicative discovery at issue (as explained supra) and future disputes \"over what is \n5 appropriately part of the liability phase versus the damages phase.\" Evertz Microsystems Ltd. v. \nLawo Inc., C.A. No. 19-302-MN-JLH , 2021 WL 706457, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 23, 2021). Therefore , \nthis factor also does not support bifurcation. \nThird, GSM has not met its burden to demonstrate that bifurcation will enhance juror \ncomprehension. GSM's bare allegations during oral argument that the jury may be confused and \nunable to distinguish between patent infringement and trademark infringement underestimates the \nability of juries and are not persuasive. \nFinally, GSM's assertion that \"[t]here is no basis or benefit to holding damages for \ntrademark infringement in limbo while the parties adjudicate the patent infringement claims\" does \nnot carry the day. D.I. 18 at 4. \"[T]he major consideration [in considering bifurcation] is directed \ntoward the choice most likely to result in a just final disposition of the litigation ,\" not just the \nchoice most likely to favor disposition of GSM's claims and/or defenses. Innotron, 800 F.2d at \n1084 ( emphasis added). Bifurcation is not appropriate under these circumstances. Sprint, 2021 \nWL 982730, at * 1. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, GSM has not met its burden to demonstrate that bifurcation will \navoid prejudice , conserve judicial resources , and enhance juror comprehension. \nWHEREFORE, at Wilmington this 9-tv\\ of January, 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \nthat GSM's Motion to Bifurcate (D.I. 18) is DENIED . \n6 GREGORYB .
