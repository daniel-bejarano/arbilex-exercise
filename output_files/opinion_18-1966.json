The patents in this case cover technology that helps make that happen.  \nTexasLDPC has six patents for a low- density parity -check (LDPC) decoder. Broadcom  2 (including co defendants LSI and Avago)  has put fort h many terms  in those patents  \nfor construction. I construe some here. \nI. CLAIM CONSTRUCTION  \n\u201cIt is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the in-\nvention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\u201d Phillips v. AWS Corp ., \n415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005)  (en banc)  (internal quotation marks omitted). \nClaim construction is a matter of law. See Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. , 574 \nU.S. 318, 325\u2013 26 (2015). So \u201c[w]hen the parties raise an actual dispute regarding the \nproper scope of these claims, the court, not the jury, must resolve that dispute.\u201d O2 \nMicro Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co. , 521 F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  \nA court generally gives the words in a claim \u201ctheir ordinary and customary mean-\ning,\u201d which is the \u201cmeaning that [they] would have to a person of ordinary skill in the \nart in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the \npatent application.\u201d Id. at 1312\u2013 13 (internal quotation marks omitted). Usually, a \ncourt first considers the claim language, then the remaining intrinsic evidence, and \nthen, in limited circumstances, extrinsic evidence. See Interactive Gift Express, Inc. \nv. Compuserve Inc., 256 F.3d 1323, 1331 \u201332 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  \nIntrinsic evidence includes the patent specification, which \u201cis always highly rele-\nvant to the claim construction analysis and indeed is often the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d AstraZeneca AB v. Mylan Pharms. Inc. , 19 F.4th \n1325, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). So a court must con-\nstrue claims consistent with the specification  while  \u201cavoid [ing] the danger of reading 3 limitations from the specification into the claim.\u201d Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1323. In addi-\ntion, \u201c[e]ven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, the claims of \nthe patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear \nintention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or \nrestriction.\u201d Hill-Rom Svcs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp. , 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).  \nA court may refer to extrinsic evidence only if the disputed term\u2019s ordinary and \naccustomed meaning cannot be discerned from the intrinsic evidence. See Vitronics \nCorp. v. Conceptronic, Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Although a court may \nnot use extrinsic evidence to vary or cont radict the claim language, extrinsic materi-\nals \u201cmay be helpful to explain scientific principles, the meaning of technical terms, and terms of art that appear in the patent and prosecution history.\u201d Markman v. \nWestview Instruments, Inc. , 52 F.3d 967, 980 (F ed. Cir. 1995)  (en banc) , aff\u2019d, 517 U.S. \n370 (1996). Extrinsic evidence is used \u201cto ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the \nart.\u201d Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1318. The Fede ral Circuit has cautioned against relying on \nexpert reports and testimony that is generated for the purpose of litigation because it is often  biased. Id. \nUltimately, \u201c[t]he construction that stays true to the claim language and most \nnaturally aligns with t he patent\u2019s description of the invention will be \u2026 the correct \nconstruction.\u201d Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa\u2019 per Anzioni , 158 F.3d 1243, 1250 \n(Fed. Cir. 1998). It follows that \u201ca claim interpretation that would exclude the 4 inventor\u2019s device is rarely the  correct interpretation.\u201d Modine Mfg. Co. v. U.S. Int\u2019l \nTrade Comm\u2019n , 75 F.3d 1545, 1550 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  \nII. TERMS  \nBroadcom has asked me to construe ten  terms  (or sets of terms). Five are ordinary , \nso I start with those.  I then address two  terms  that Broadcom says are part of means -\nplus-functions claims and thus governed by special  claim -construction  rules. Finally, \nI address three  terms that Broadcom says are  indefinite.  \nFor convenience, I begin my discussion of each term  (or set of terms) with a tabl e \nthat lays out the parties\u2019 suggested construction s along with  my decision. \nA. Ordinary Terms  \n1. \u201cR new message\u201d; \u201cR old message\u201d; \u201cR prev message\u201d  \n TexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nR new \nmessage  Plain and ordinary meaning, which is \ncurrent R message  Defined in the \nspecification as an R \nmessage that is \u201cbeing computed for the present \nlayer in the present \niteration\u201d  An R message that \nis being computed for the present \nlayer in the present \niteration \nR old message  Plain and ordinary meaning, which is R message that comprises \ninformation \ncomputed in the previous iteration  Defined in the \nspecification as an R message that was \u201ccomputed in the previous iteration\u201d for \n\u201cthe next layer to be \nprocessed in the present \niteration\u201d  An R message that was computed in the previous iteration for the \nnext layer to be \nprocessed in the present iteration  5  TexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nR prev \nmessage  Plain and ordinary \nmeaning, which is \ndelayed old R message  Defined in the \nspecification as an R message that was \n\u201ccomputed in the \nprevio us iteration\u201d for \n\u201cthe layer presently being processed in the \npresent iteration\u201d  An R message that \nwas computed in the previous \niteration for the \nlayer presently being processed in the present \niteration  \nPatentees can be their own lexicographers. So w hen a  patent defines a term, \ncourts will usually accept that definition. Sinorgchem Co., Shandong v. Int\u2019l Trade \nComm. , 511 F.3d 1132, 1138 (Fed. Cir. 2007). But there are qualifications. First, it is \nnot always clear when a patent is defining  a term rather tha n explaining it. Baxalta \nInc. v. Genentech, Inc. , 972 F.3d 1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Second, courts favor \nreading patents to be internally consistent. Id.  This applies to finding consistency \nacross groups of related patents, too.  \nThe patents at issue share specifications. Each has the same Figure  5 with the \nsame explanatory language:  \nIn discussing the present and subsequent embodiments, a distinction is made \nregarding the various R messages presented. Assume, for example, that layer  I \nand iteration  i are presently being processed. The next layer to be processed in \nthe present iteration  i has R messages that were computed in the previous it-\neration. These messages are termed \u201cR old\u201d messages. The layer presently be-ing processed in the present iteration has R messages that were computed in the previous iteration. These messages are termed \u201cR prev\u201d messages. The R messages that are being computed for the present layer in the present iteration are termed \u201cR new\u201d messages.  \n\u2019023 patent 10:64 \u201311:8; \u2019140 patent 10:66 \u201311:10; \u2019250 patent 11:46\u2013 57; \u2019522 patent \n11:46\u2013 57; \u2019530 patent 11:56\u2013 67; \u2019950 patent 12:2 \u201313. I adopt these definitions as con-\nstructions.  6 There are several reasons to treat this language as definitional. First, it puts the \nterms in quotation marks and introduces them with \u201ctermed.\u201d These are classic  tex-\ntual markers of definitions. See Sinorgchem , 511 F.3d at 113 6. Second, Figure  5 is \nthe first time \u201cR new message,\u201d \u201cR old message,\u201d and \u201cR prev message\u201d are used in \nthe figures, and this  definitional language is the first time they are used in the spec-\nificatio n. It is common practice to define terms the first time they are used. Third, the \nreference to \u201cpresent and subsequent embodiments\u201d suggests that these definitions \nare not somehow limited to Figure 5 or its embodiments.  \nThe patent prosecution history confi rms this reading. In response to the exam-\niner\u2019s rejection of certain claims because \u201cR new\u201d and \u201cR old\u201d were indefinite, the inventors wrote, \u201cApplicants respectfully submit that the terms \u2018R new\u2019 and \u2018R old\u2019 \nmessages are defined by the specification, and respectfully request that the rejections \nunder \u00a7  112 be withdrawn.\u201d App.  144. They pointed to this  same  definitional language \nas support. Id.  TexasLDPC hastens to add  that the inventors also said that the terms \nare \u201cfurther elucidated\u201d by certain equations  and \u201cthe remainder of the specification \nwhere the terms are discussed throughout.\u201d Id. Fair enough. But \u201cfurther elucidated\u201d \ndoes not mean \u201ccontradicted.\u201d  \nTexasLDPC\u2019s primary objection is that adopting these definitions would create \ninternal inconsistency . As support, TexasLDPC points out that \u201cthe asserted claims \nof the \u2019950 Patent require an \u2018R old message\u2019 to be produced for the currently pro-\ncessed layer, but Defendants\u2019 construction of \u2018R old message\u2019 requires it to be pro-\nduced for \u2018the next layer. \u2019\u201d Br. 18. But claims in the \u2019950 patent, the last issued, 7 cannot overcome explicit definitions in the other five patents and change their mean-\ning retroactively.  \nFinally, if the intrinsic record left any doubt, I would find the explanation of  \nBroadcom\u2019s expert, Dr.  Zhang,  helpful. He explained that these definitions specify \nboth the layer and the iteration in order to pick out just one value, whereas TexasLDPC\u2019s  proposed constructions include only iteration information and so are \nincomplete. Tr.  97:3\u2013 98:4. \nFor all these reasons, I construe these three terms to have the definition provided \nin the specification.  \n2. \u201cpartial state\u201d  \nTexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nPlain and \nordinary meaning  Two up -to-date least \nminimum Q messages  Information that is tracked while \nQ messages are processed  \nJust before the hearing, Broadcom proposed a \u201ccompromise\u201d construction  for \u201cpar-\ntial state\u201d: \u201cStored information that is tracked while Q messages are serially pro-\ncessed  and used to determine the final state .\u201d Tr. 102:2\u201318; 106:5\u2013 18. This construc-\ntion resolved several flaws in Broadcom\u2019s original proposal, so it was the starting \npoint for discussion at oral argument . Broadcom did not press for \u201cand used to deter-\nmine the final state,\u201d likely recognizing that partial state information can have other \nuses. The remaining disputes were over \u201cstored\u201d and \u201cserially.\u201d  Tr. 106:22 \u2013107:20.  \n\u201cStored\u201d is unnecessary and likely to create confusion. All information that is \ntracked is, one way or another, stored. So \u201cstored\u201d is implied by \u201ctracked,\u201d as the \nparties\u2019 experts agreed.  Tr. 109:5\u2013110:23; 113:2 \u201319. And specifying that partial state 8 infor mation must be \u201cstored\u201d is likely to create confusion, as it might be read to re-\nquire a certain kind of storage. The patents are not so limited. So I omit \u201cstored\u201d from \nthe construction.  \n\u201cSerially\u201d is also likely to create confusion. The two classic forms of processing \ndisclosed by the patents are serial (one at a time) and parallel (all at the same time). \nBut there are forms of processing that combine elements of each. The patents call \nthem  \u201cblock serial\u201d  or \u201cblock parallel,\u201d  and the literature  often calls  them  \u201cpartial \nparallel.\u201d Tr.  113:24 \u2013114:3; 116:23 \u2013117:3. Some hybrid forms of processing use par-\ntial state information. (Indeed,  TexasLDPC\u2019s expert,  Dr. Mitzenmacher, explained \nthat even strictly parallel processing can have a partial state. Tr.  116:18 \u201320.) Includ-\ning \u201cserially\u201d in the construction  might be read to exclude these partially serial forms . \nSo, to avoid confusion and cover every application of partial state information con-\ntemplated by the patents without sweeping too broadly, I omit \u201cserially\u201d f rom the \nconstruction.  \n3. \u201ca final state for [each/a] block row\u201d  \nTexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nPlain and \nordinary \nmeaning  The first and second minimum \nmagnitudes of all Q messages in \na block row with offset applied  Information from processing Q \nmessages in a block row and \nused to select R messages  \nJust before the hearing, Broadcom proposed a \u201ccompromise\u201d construction  for \u201ca \nfinal state for [each / a] block row\u201d : \u201cStored information originating from serially pro-\ncessing all Q messages in a block row and used to select R messages for the block \nrow.\u201d  Tr. 128:10 \u2013130:6.  This construction resolved several flaws in Broadcom\u2019s origi-\nnal proposal  and was the starting point for discussion at oral argument . The 9 remaining disputes were over \u201cstored,\u201d \u201coriginating,\u201d \u201cserially,\u201d \u201call,\u201d and \u201cfor the \nblock row.\u201d  Tr. 129:24 \u2013130:6.  \nI omit \u201cstored\u201d and \u201cserially\u201d  for the same reasons as in \u201cpartial state.\u201d  And I omit \n\u201coriginating\u201d as superfluous.  \nI also omit \u201call\u201d and \u201cfor the block row.\u201d These words are unduly limiting.  The \nclaim language uses the indefinite article , referring to \u201c a final state ,\u201d suggesting that \nthere is more than one final state for each block row. That is consistent with the technology. In sub -block processing, for example, each sub -block will yield a final \nstate, and the final states together will yield the final state for the block row. Those \nsub-block final states can be stored in a final state storage array . If confirmation were \nneeded, I would be persuaded  by Dr.  Mitzenmacher\u2019s expl anation that sub-block final \nstates  can be used again in processing . Tr. 146:23 \u2013147:16.  So construing \u201ca final state \nfor a block row\u201d as \u201cinformation from processing all  Q messages in a block row and \nused to select R messages for the block row \u201d would effectively rewrite \u201ca\u201d as \u201cthe,\u201d \nexcluding the possibility of reusing these individual final states.  \n4. Variables  \n TexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nM1 (\u2019250 \npatent \nclaim  41) Plain and \nordinary \nmeaning  A first minimum value \ndetermined by a first \ncomparator  No construction \nnecessary  \nM2 (\u2019250 \npatent \nclaim  41) Plain and \nordinary \nmeaning  A second minimum value \ndetermined by a second \ncomparator  No construction necessary  \nM1 PS (\u2019250 \npatent \nclaim  41) Plain and \nordinary \nmeaning  A first stored minimum value \ninput into a first comparator No construction necessary  10  TexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.

D.I.  481. S o the dispute over these terms is now moot.  \n5. \u201cLDPC array parameters\u201d  \nTexas LDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nPlain and ordinary meaning  p (prime number representing \nsize of square permutation \nmatrix in the LDPC parity \ncheck matrix), k (check node degree), j (variable node degree) and q (number of rows/columns \npunctured) for array codes  p (prime number representing \nsize of square permutation \nmatrix in the LDPC parity \ncheck matrix), k (check node degree), j (variable node degree) and q (number of rows/columns \npunctured) for array codes  \n\u201cLDPC array code\u201d is a term of art that refers to a mathematically specified type \nof code. But \u201carray,\u201d on its own, has a generic meaning: a structured collection of \nthings. The patents use both meanings of the term. The question here is whether \n\u201cLDPC array parameters\u201d refers to array code or is interchangeable with \u201cLDPC ma-\ntrix parameters.\u201d  I find that \u201cLDPC array parameters\u201d refers to array code and so \nadopt Broadcom\u2019s construction. That construction is drawn from the specification\u2019s \ndefinition of array code parameters and adds the parameter used to enable rate -11 compatible decoding, as required by the claim.  See \u2019522 patent 6:12\u2013 55, 13: 11\u201317; see \nalso Br. 40\u201341; App.  82\u201385. \nAlthough \u201carray\u201d is used in a generic sense in the specification, it is never used to \nmean \u201cmatrix.\u201d Indeed, counsel for TexasLDPC admitted as much at the hearing. \nTr. 162:3\u2013 14. Instead, it is used to refer to a collection of units. Yet that is not its \nfunction in this claim term, leaving only LDPC array code as a possible meaning. And it is more reasonable to give the term one of the meanings it already has in the patent \nthan to assign it a new meaning seen nowhere else.  \nTexasLDPC objects that a person of ordinary skill in the art  would understand \nLDPC array parameters \u201cto mean any  paramete rs affecting the structure and content \nof an H matrix.\u201d Br.  42. So, because both block codes and array codes can be made \nmulti -rate compatible in the specification, a person of ordinary skill in the art  would \nchange whichever parameters accomplish that goa l. The trouble is that this reading  \nseems to read \u201cLDPC array\u201d out of the claim by making it synonymous with the broad-\nest reading of \u201cparameters.\u201d  And we presume that each word in a claim has meaning.  \nIn sum, although \u201cLDPC array parameters\u201d is ambiguous, I find it appropriate to \nassign it the meaning consistent with the language of the specification rather than a new, broad meaning that would render some words superfluous.  \nB. Terms in Means -Plus -Function Claims  \nNow, I move on to terms that Broadcom says are part of  means -plus-function \nclaims . Though patent  terms are usually not  limited by the specification , they are for \nmeans -plus-function claims . 35 U.S.C. \u00a7  112(6)  (current version at 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(f)). 12 So if a claim qualifies as means -plus-function,  \u00a7 112(6)  applies, and I must look to the \nspecification to li mit its terms.  \nIf a claim uses the word \u201cmeans,\u201d there is a rebuttable presumption that \u00a7  112(6) \napplies. See Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC , 792 F.3d 1339, 1348 (Fed. C ir. 2015) \n(en banc) . On the other hand, if a claim does not use the word \u201cmeans,\u201d courts rebut-\ntably presume  that \u00a7 112(6) does not apply. See id.  To establish  that a claim without \nthe word \u201cmeans\u201d is governed by \u00a7 112(6), a party must show  that the term alleged to \nbe the equivalent of \u201cmeans\u201d is  \u201cunderstood by persons of ordinary skill in the art to \nhave a sufficiently definite meaning as the name for structure.\u201d Id.  at 1349.  \nAs always, a court first looks to intrinsic evidence to decide th is. But extrinsic \nevidence is particularly helpful here: \u201c[B]ecause this inquiry turns on the understand-\ning of a person of ordinary skill in the art, we often look to extrinsic evidence when \ndetermining whether a disputed limitation would have connoted str ucture to a person \nof ordinary skill. \u201d Dyfan, LLC v. Target Corp. , 28 F.4th 1360, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2022).  \nThere are many ways to connote sufficient structure, including describing \u201ca class of \nstructures\u201d or describing \u201cthe claim limitation\u2019s operation and h ow the function is \nachieved in the case of the invention.\u201d Id.  (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n1. \u201ccontrol unit\u201d  \nTexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.

It has not met that \nburden. \u201cControl unit\u201d connotes sufficient structure and has a readily understandable \nmeaning: a hardware component that provides control -level inform ation (such as \nscheduling) to the rest of the decoder.  \n\u201cUnit \u201d certainly provides some structure. As the claim context shows, a \u201cunit\u201d is a \nhardware component on a decoder chip.  And I accept Dr.  Mitzenmacher\u2019s declaration \nthat this structure would be readily apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art . \nSee App.  305\u2013 06. It is thus not a black box or a nonce term equivalent to \u201cmeans.\u201d  \nBut Broadcom wants more. Because there are many ways to build a unit, Broad-\ncom argues, the inventors needed to spell out the microarchitecture of a control unit. \nThey point out that other \u201cunit\u201d terms have  such microarchitectures described in the \nspecification. See Br. 57, 59, 62, 64.  As a fallback, TexasLDPC  notes that there is a \nmicroarchitecture for a control unit, too.  See \u2019950 patent 13:36\u2013 38, 16:61 \u201317:2.  \nBut I do not find a microarchitecture necessary. T he question is not whether \u201cunit\u201d \nconnotes comprehensive structure, but rather whether it connotes sufficient  struc-\nture. See Dyfan , 28 F.4th at 13 65\u201366. It does: it is sufficient that a control unit is a \nhardware component on a decoder chip with defined inputs, outputs, and connections. \nSee Apple Inc. v. Motorola, Inc. , 757 F.3d 1286, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\u201cStructure may \nalso be provided by describing the claim limitation\u2019s operation, such as its input, out-put, or connections. \u201d), overruled on other grounds by  Williamson v. Citrix Online, \nLLC, 729 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2015); cf. Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc. v. Prisua Eng\u2019g 15 Corp. , 948 F.3d 1342, 1353 \u201354 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\u201cAs used in the claims of the \u2019591 \npatent, the term \u2018digital pr ocessing unit\u2019 clearly serves as a stand -in for a \u2018general \npurpose computer\u2019 or a \u2018central processing unit,\u2019 each of which would be understood \nas a reference to structure in this case, not simply any device that can perform a \nparticular function.\u201d); Linear Tech. Corp. v. Impala Linear Corp. , 379 F.3d 1311, 1320 \n(Fed. Cir. 2004) (finding that \u201cwhen the structure -connoting term \u2018circuit\u2019 is coupled \nwith a description of the circuit\u2019s operation, sufficient structural meaning generally \nwill be conveyed\u201d).  So I do not find that \u201ccontrol unit\u201d is governed by 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 112(6) , and I construe it to have its plain and ordinary meaning.  \n2. \u201ccheck node unit\u201d  \nTexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nPlain and \nordinary meaning; not governed by \u00a7 112(6)  Should be construed under \u00a7  112(6)  \n Structure : microarchitecture 200 as \nconfigured in Figure  2A or Figure  3 of \nthe \u2019250 patent  \n \nFunction: \n\u201cperform [] block parallel processing\u201d \n(\u2019250 patent claim  30) \nReceive a \u201c[Q/varia ble] message\u201d \nprovided to the unit ( \u2019250 patent \nclaims  6, 13; \u2019522 patent claim  27; \u2019520 \npatent claim  13) \nPartial state processing (\u2019950 patent claims  1, 9) Plain and ordinary meaning; not governed by \u00a7 112(6)  \nThe dispute over \u201ccheck node unit\u201d tracks the dispute over \u201ccontrol unit.\u201d I asked \nthe experts to submit letters identifying uses of the term in the field around 2008. See \nD.I. 464. Their reports confirm that the issue is whether \u201cunit\u201d is a name for 16 structure.  See D.I. 482, 483. As discussed above, it is. And the inputs, outputs, and \nfunct ions of check node units are well established in the patents. So I find that this \nterm is not governed by \u00a7 112(6) and give it its plain and ordinary meaning . \nC. Allegedly Indefinite Terms  \nFinally, I construe three terms that Broadcom says are indefinite and thus, invalid  \nunder \u00a7  112(2) . \u201cThe specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly \npointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards \nas his invention.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7  112(2) (current version at 35 U.S.C. \u00a7  112(b)). So \u201ca pa-\ntent is inval id for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification deline-\nating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable cer-tainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\u201d Nautilus, Inc. v. \nBiosig Ins truments, Inc. , 572 U.S. 898, 901 (2014).  The party asserting indefiniteness \nbears the burden of proving it by clear and convincing evidence. S ee 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 282(a); see also Nautilus, 572 U.S. at 912 n.10;  Noonan & Kelly,  Patent Claim Con-\nstruction in the Federal Circuit  \u00a7 5:1 (2022 ed.).  \n1. \u201cthe check node degree\u201d  \nTexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nPlain and ordinary meaning  Indefinite  No construction necessary  \nAfter the hearing, TexasLDPC  withdrew its infringement assertion against \nclaim  41 of the \u2019250 patent. See D.I. 481. So the dispute over \u201cthe check node degree\u201d \nis now moot.  17 2. \u201cwithout active routers\u201d  \nTexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nPlain and ordinary meaning  Indefinite  Plain an d ordinary meaning  \nClaim  27 of the \u2019522 patent describes, in part, \u201can array of CNUs  [check node \nunits] , the CNUs of the array interconnected, without active routers, to provide in-\ncremental shifts.\u201d I find that Broadcom has not met its burden of showing indefinite-\nness by clear and convincing evidence. I construe the term according to its plain and ordinary meaning: by passive wired interconnection.  \nClaim s are construed in light of the patent as a whole. And claim  20 sheds light \nby describing routing that \u201cis accomplished by passive wired interconnection, rather \nthan by active routers.\u201d This strongly suggests that \u201cwithout active routers\u201d means \n\u201cby passive wired interconnection.\u201d  \nThe specification supports this interpretation. It describes embodimen ts that \u201cuse \nconstant wiring  \u2026 thus eliminat[ing] both the forward router  \u2026 and the reverse \nrouter.\u201d \u2019522 patent 10:37 \u201344. This language, in concert with claim  20, leaves open \nonly one understanding: Active routers are routers that are in use, routing mess ages \nas they come along. If a decoder does not use active routers, it is using passive wired \ninterconnections. One way to make the wiring passive is to eliminate routers alto-\ngether, which the specification calls constant wiring. Another way to make the wir ing \npassive is to have routers but not use them \u2014that is, to pre -arrange the routers so \nthat messages simply pass along them without the routers\u2019 actively considering where to send the messages. Thus, based on the intrinsic evidence, \u201cwithout active 18 routers \u201d means by passive wired interconnection \u2014whether that interconnection is \npassive because the routers are inactive or because there are no routers.  \nBroadcom objects that this interpretation renders \u201cby passive wired inter connec-\ntion, rather than by active ro uters\u201d superfluous. Br.  72; \u2019522 patent, claim  20. I disa-\ngree. Claim  20 is the first time \u201cactive routers\u201d is used in the \u2018522 patent claims . So \nit makes sense to explain that it is the alternative to \u201cpassive wir ed interconnection.\u201d \nThe next time the patent uses \u201cactive routers\u201d in claim  27, it appropriately omits this \nexplanation. \nIf the intrinsic evidence were not convincing enough, I would also find \nDr. Mitzenmacher\u2019s explanation helpful. See  Tr. 239:1\u2013 242:6.  As he explained, a per-\nson of ordinary skill in the art  would understand that routers can be pre -set along \nwiring without actively routing information in a particular cycle. See i d. This is  con-\nsistent with the construction compelled by the intrinsic record.  \nBecause it would be clear to a person of ordinary skill  in the art that \u201cwithout \nactive routers\u201d means by passive wired interconnection, I give this term its plain and \nordinary meaning . If it becomes apparent that the jury is likely to be confused, I will \nconsider spelling out the construction at that time.  \n3. \u201ctotal number of elements in [a/the] block row [in/of] [the/a] LDPC [parity \ncheck] matrix\u201d  \nTexasLDPC  Broadcom et al.  The Court  \nPlain and ordinary meaning  Indefinite  Indefinite  \nClaim  30 of the \u2019250 patent includes an array  of units that \u201cprocesses a plurality \n(U) of block columns of a plurality (M) of rows in a layer of an LDPC parity check 19 matrix in one clock cycle, where M\u2264p, and p is a total number of elements in a block \nrow of the LDPC parity check matrix ; U\u2264dc, and d c is check node degree of the block \nrow.\u201d Claim  11 of the \u2019530 patent  uses similar language, and the parties agree that \nthe same analysis applies to both. The question is what \u201celements\u201d means in these \nclaims.  That word is not used in this context anywhere i n the patents. I find this term \nindefinite . \nIn its briefs, TexasLDPC argued that \u201celements\u201d means \u201crows.\u201d See Br. 74. But \nthis construction is untenable. \u201c[R]ows\u201d is used in the very same sentence as \u201cele-ments,\u201d so they must be understood to have different  meanings.  Sensing this, \nTexasLDPC\u2019s  counsel pivoted at the hearing, arguing that that \u201celements\u201d could  \nmean rows or could have a broader meaning. Tr.  253:7\u2013 254:19. Dr. Mitzenmacher  \nagreed . Tr. 258:2 \u20136. \nThat leaves us with only one remaining clue: that M\u2264p. Rewritten, this means \nthat the total number of elements in a block row of an LDPC matrix is greater than \nor equal to a plurality of rows in a layer of that matrix. M has upper and lower bounds : \nbecause  it is a plurality, M must be at least 2, and because it is a count of rows, M \ncannot be larger than the number of rows. But p has far less definite bounds. Because p is at least equal to M, its lower bound is also 2. But its only upper bound is the \nhighes t possible count of elements in a block row. This equation, then, also fails to  \ntell us what an element is. The only things we can glean from the claim are that (1) an \nelement is not necessarily a row, and (2)  there are at least 2 elements in a block row.  \nThat leaves far too many options for \u201celements\u201d to be definite.  20 Recognizing this problem, TexasLDPC appeals to context. Dr.  Mitzenmacher  ar-\ngued that \u201celements\u201d would mean a row or a group of rows. Tr.  258:17\u2013 260:23. But \nhe would not rule out the possibilit y that it could also include subcomponents of a \nrow. Tr. 260:24\u2013 261:11. Counsel then tried to backtrack, arguing that any sub compo-\nnent  would be irrelevant to processing and so a person of ordinary skill  in the art \nwould only think of elements as including rows or groups of rows. Tr.  264:1\u2013 265:1; \n266:23\u2013 267:14. This confusion illustrates the problem. TexasLDPC wants me  to read \n\u201celements\u201d as meaning a row or group of rows, but neither the claim nor the technol-\nogy is so limited. At best, \u201celements\u201d is a placeholder for anything that is technologi-\ncally possible and at least equal to 2. That claim term is not definite . \n* * * * * \nWith these constructions, the parties can start narrowing this case. After wards , I \nwill consider the need for more constructions.
