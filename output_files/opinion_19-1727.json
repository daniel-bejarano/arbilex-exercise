(D.1. 354). The motion has been fully \nbriefed. (D.I. 355, 358, 363). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' motion is granted in part \nand denied in part. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn September 13, 2019, Plaintiffs Allergan USA, Inc., Allergan Holdings Unlimited \nCompany, and Eden Biodesign, LLC (collectively, \"Allergan\" or \"Plaintiffs\") filed their \nComplaint alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,675,587 (the \"'587 Patent\") and 10,188,632 \n(the \"'632 Patent\") against Defendant Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited. The alleged \ninfringement is based on Sun filing Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") No. 213447 \nwith the FDA. Over the course of the litigation in this case, Allergan filed continuation applications \nat+d prosecuted patents belonging to the patent family at issue. Allergan later obtained U.S. Patent \nNos. 11,007,179 (the '\"179 Patent\"), 11,090,291 (the \"'291 Patent\"), and 11,160,792 (the '\"792 \nPatent\"), and asserted them against Sun in July 2021, August 2021, and November 2021, \nrespectively. The actions asserting these patents were consolidated with this action. \nAllergan obtained U.S. Patent Nos. 11,229,627 (the \"'627 Patent\") and 11,311,516 (the \n'\"516 Patent\") in January 2022 and April 2022, respectively. Allergan filed an Amended \nComplaint asserting the '627 Patent and the '516 Patent against Sun. (D.I. 343). Sun filed its \nAnswer on May 16, 2022. (D.I. 346). Sun later filed an Amended Answer on May 27, 2022. (D.1. \n349). In its Amended Answer, Sun raises, among other things, a counterclaim and affirmative \ndefense that the '516 Patent is unenforceable because of Allergan's unclean hands. (Id at 8-10, \n15-18). \n2 Sun also pleads three other affirmative defenses. Sun alleges that the '627 Patent's and \n'516 Patent's claims are barred by prosecution history estoppel and/or judicial estoppel, that \nAllergan's claims are barred by the equitable doctrines of waiver, estoppel, and/or laches, and that \nAllergan's claims are barred by the doctrine of patent misuse. (Id. at 10). \nOn June 10, 2022, Allergan filed the pending motion to dismiss the counterclaim of unclean \nhands under Rule 12(b )( 6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and to strike \nthe related affirmative defenses under Rule 12(:f). \nIi. LEGALSTANDARD \nA. MOTION TO DISMISS COUNTERCLAIM UNDER RULE 12(b )(6) \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires a complainant to provide \"a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). Rule \n12(b)(6) allows the accused party to bring a motion to dismiss a claim for \"failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b )( 6). A Rule l 2(b )( 6) motion may be granted \nonly if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the counterclaim complaint as true and viewing \nthem in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \"could \nnot raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \nThe factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, \nconclusions, or a \"formulaic recitation\" of the claim elements. Id. at 555 (\"Factual allegations must \nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all the \nallegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in fact).\"). Moreover, there must be sufficient \nfactual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when the complaint's factual content \"allows \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" \nId. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops \n3 short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \nB. MOTION TO STRIKE UNDER RULE 12(t). \n\"[P]ursuant to Rule 12(\u00b1), the Court may strike from a pleading any insufficient defense.\" \nWyeth Holdings Corp. v. Sandoz, Inc., 2012 WL 600715, at *4 (D. Del Feb. 3, 2012) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \"When ruling on a motion to strike, 'the [ c ]ourt must construe all facts \nin favor of the nonmoving party and deny the motion if the defense is sufficient under law.'\" Sun \nMicrosystems, Inc. v. Versata Enters., Inc., 630 F. Supp. 2d 395, 402 (D. Del. 2009) (quoting \nProctor & Gamble Co. v. Nabisco Brands, Inc., 697 F. Supp. 1360, 1362 (D. Del. 1988)). \n\"However, a court is not required to accept affirmative defenses that are mere 'bare bones \nconclusory allegations,' and may strike such inadequately pleaded defenses.\" Sun Microsystems, \n630 F. Supp. 2d at 408 (quoting Cintron Beverage Group, LLC v. DePersia, 2008 WL 1776430, \nat *2 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 15, 2008)). \"A motion to strike a defense should not be granted 'unless the \ninsufficiency of the defense is clearly apparent.\"' Sun Microsystems, 630 F. Supp. 2d at 402 \n(quoting Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 789 F.2d 181, 188 (3d Cir. 1986), rev'd on other \ngrounds, 505 U.S. 504 (1992)). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nSun claims that Allergan misused Sun's confidential information to prosecute the '516 \nPatent and then asserted that patent against Sun. Sun alleges that prior to the date suit was filed in \n2019, Allergan consistently prosecuted patent applications that recited \"colloidal silica\" or \n\"colloidal silicon dioxide\" as a required limitation in \"each and every claim.\" (D.1. 349 at 8-9, 16-\n17). Sun alleges that after Allergan \"had accessed Sun's confi<,iential information regarding its \nANDA Product formulation,\" Allergan eliminated the limitation requiring \"colloidal silicon \ndioxide\" from claims in the patent application that led to the '179 Patent. (Id. at 9, 17). Sun alleges \n4 that Allergan later used Sun's confidential information to draft claims in the '516 Patent to \"not \nexplicitly require colloidal silica in an improper attempt to cover Sun's ANDA Product \nFormulation, which [Allergan] did not invent.\" (Id. at 17). Sun alleges that Dr. Tim Costello, one \nof the inventors named on the '516 Patent, has stated \"that he never invented any eluxadoline \ncomposition that did not include colloidal silica.\" (Id). \nIn its Answering Brief (D.I. 358), Sun disavows the theory put forth in its Amended \nAnswer. Sun still asserts a claim of unclean hands, but Sun does not allege that Allergan misused \nc9nfidential information it obtained from Sun during litigation. \"Sun is not alleging a violation of \nt~e Stipulated Protective Order or any fraudulent use of Sun's confidential information.\" (Id at \n16). Sun, instead, argues, \"Allergan gleaned Sun's confidential noninfringement position from the \n2020 Markman proceedings and then ran to the Patent Office to seek new claims to formulations \nit did not invent.\" (Id). Allergan replies that Sun's briefing should be grounds for granting \nAllergan's motion as it refutes the facts Sun alleges in its Amended Answer. (D.I. 363 at 9). I \nd~cline to read the facts or new theories from Sun's brief into Sun's Amended Answer. \"As the \nThird Circuit has stated, '[i]t is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in \nopposition to a motion to dismiss.\"' M2M Sols. LLC v. Tel it Commc 'ns PLC, 2015 WL 4640400, \nati*3 (D. Del. Aug. 5, 2015) (quoting Com. of Pa. ex rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo. Inc., 836 F.2d \n173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988)). This new theory and the facts supporting it are \"not entitled to \nconsideration in the pleading stage.\" Id Therefore, Sun's new theory does not factor in my \ndetermination that Sun has stated a claim that the '516 Patent is unenforceable under the doctrine \not'.unclean hands. 1 \n1 Sun will have the burden of proving the facts it has asserted in its Amended Answer. I do not \nopine on whether Sun's theory discussed in its Answering Brief states a claim for unclean hands. \nI also am not sure why Sun would pursue the theory stated in its Answering Brief, since the \n5 A. UNCLEAN HANDS COUNTERCLAIM \n1. Pleading Standard \nAllergan asserts that Sun's counterclaim for unclean hands sounds in fraud. (D.I. 355 at 6; \nD.I. 363 at 2-5). Allergan argues Sun's unclean hands counterclaim must'be pied with particularity \nas required by the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) standard. \nSun contends that its unclean hands counterclaim is based on unconscionability and bad \nfaith. Sun argues it only needs to meet Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8's less demanding \nrequirements for pleading its counterclaim because it does not sound in fraud. (D.I. 358 at 16). In \nit~ Amended Answer, Sun alleges, \"Plaintiffs misused Sun's confidential information relating to \nI \nI its eluxadoline ANDA product formulation to obtain claims that Plaintiffs did not invent and then \na~serted those claims against Sun.\" (D.I. 349 at 8, 16). Sun characterizes these allegations as a type \nof \"litigation misconduct.\" (Id at 9, 17). \n\"Unclean hands is an equitable defense requiring the showing of five elements: (1) the \nparty seeking affirmative relief (2) is guilty of conduct involving fraud, deceit, unconscionability, \nor: bad faith (3) directly related to matter in issue ( 4) that injures other party ( 5) and affects balance \nof equities between litigants.\" Sonos, Inc., v. D&M Holdings Inc., 2016 WL 4249493, at *5 (D. \nDel. Aug. 10, 2016) (quoting Sun Microsystems, 630 F. Supp. 2d at410). The conduct \"must have \nan. immediate and necessary relationship to the equity which [the plaintiff] seeks to obtain in the \nmatter in litigation.\" Sun Microsystems, 630 F. Supp. 2d at 410 (quoting Blanchette v. Providence \nI \n&:Worcester Co., 428 F. Supp. 347,357 (D. Del. 1977)). \nI \npremise is that the claims lack written description. If they do, I will not need to reach the \nequitable defenses. If they do not, the equitable defenses will fail. Thus, it seems the theory adds \nnothing. \n6 The pleadings standard for unclean hands depends on the specific conduct alleged. A \ncounterclaim or affirmative defense that alleges fraudulent conduct must be pied with particularity \nunder Rule 9(6). See, e.g., Sanos, 2016 WL 4249493 at *5. Allegations that are founded on other \ntheories, however, need only meet the Rule 8 standard. \"Sanos is authority for the proposition that \nan unclean hands defense based on fraud or misrepresentation must satisfy the pleading \nrequirements of Rule 9(6 ), but not for the broader proposition that every invocation of unclean \nhands must satisfy Rule 9(6).\" AbbVie Inc. v. Boehringer Ingelheim Int'! GmbH, 2018 WL \n2604825, at *1 (D. Del. June 4, 2018). \nI find that Rule 8 is the correct standard to apply in the present case. Sun has only claimed \nthat Allergan has committed litigation misconduct, not fraud. In its Amended Answer, Sun alleges \nthat Allergan misused Sun's confidential information, which Allergan obtained from Sun through \nthe course of this litigation.2 Specifically, Sun alleges that Allergan used Sun's confidential \ninformation to draft the claims of the ' 179 Patent and the '516 Patent in an improper attempt to \ncover Sun's ANDA formulation.3 Courts have applied Rule 8 to analyze similar unclean hands \n2 Allergan also contends, \"Sun is necessarily claiming that Allergan's [patent] prosecutors \npursued claims by either intentionally withholding D testimony or knowingly misrepresenting to \nthe PTO that Allergan invented [certain] claims.\" (D.I. 363 at 4). Allergan argues that the \nconduct Sun accuses Allergan of is akin to \"defrauding the PTO,\" which must be pied in \naccordance with Rule 9(6 ). (Id). Sun's amended answer, however, does not allege nor claim that \nAllergan committed inequitable conduct. Therefore, I find Rule 9(6) is not applicable to \nan.alyzing the sufficiency of Sun's counterclaim of unclean hands. \n3 Allergan cites to Kingsdowne Med. Consultants, Ltd v. Hollister Inc., 863 F.2d 867, 874 (Fed. \nCir. 1988), for the proposition \"that there is nothing improper, illegal or inequitable in filing a \npatent application for the purpose of obtaining a right to exclude a known competitor's product \nfrom the market; nor is it in any manner improper to amend or insert claims intended to cover a \ncompetitor's product the applicant's attorney has learned about during the prosecution of a patent \napplication.\" Sun claims that Allergan drafted its claims to cover an invention that Allergan had \nnot invented, using Sun's confidential information, so that it would cover Sun's ANDA \nformulation. The conduct goes beyond simply drafting claims to cover a known competitor's \nproduct. See also Natera, Inc. v. Genosity, Inc., 2022 WL 767602 (D. Del. March 14, 2022). \n7 pleadings. See, e.g., Jazz Pharms., Inc. v. Roxane Lab ys, Inc., 2013 WL 6858765, at *5 (D.N.J. \nDec. 30, 2013) ( applying Rule 8 to analyze the defendant's unclean hands defense alleging plaintiff \nused confidential information obtained in the course oflitigation to prosecute continuation patent). \nTherefore, I find that Rule 8 should apply to determine whether Sun has sufficiently pled \nits counterclaim for unclean hands. \n2. Sufficiency of the Pleading \nAllergan asserts that Sun's allegations fail to meet Rule S's requirements. (D.I. 363 at 7). \nAllergan argues Sun's counterclaim should be dismissed because Sun's Opposition Brief \n\"conced[ es] that none of Sun's confidential information was actually misused\" by Allergan, and \nthus is grounds for dismissal. (D.I. 363 at 3, 9). \nSun argues that it has sufficiently stated a claim for unclean hands. In its Amended Answer, \nSun alleges that Allergan misused Sun's confidential information, which Allergan obtained from \nSun, to prosecute the '516 Patent in a manner to cover Sun's ANDA formulation, and then assert \nthat patent against Sun. (D.I. 349 at 9-10, 17-18). Sun argues such conduct is unconscionable and \nshould render the '516 Patent unenforceable against Sun. (D.I. 388 at 15). \nI find that Sun's Amended Answer states a plausible claim for unclean hands. Sun has \nalleged facts to show that Allergan changed its strategy for prosecuting patents -by eliminating \nthe inclusion of \"colloidal silica\" or \"colloidal silicon dioxide\" as a limitation to certain claims -\nafter it had access to Sun's confidential information pertaining to Sun's ANDA formulation. The \npresent case is similar to Natera, Inc. v. Genosity, Inc., 2022 WL 767602 (D. Del. March 14, 2022). \nIn Natera, the court found that Genosity had sufficiently pled an affirmative defense of unclean \nhands by alleging: (1) Natera never claimed ArcherDX's method in previous prosecution at the \nPTO, (2) one of Natera's executives left Natera to work at ArcherDX, (3) that executive gained \n8 access to the confidential information relating to ArcherDX's technology, (4) that executive then \nreturned to Natera, and (5) Natera then drafted the claims of its patent in an attempt to cover \nArcherDX. Id at *5. Sun alleges a similar timeline of changing patent prosecution strategy after \ngaining access to confidential information.4 Therefore, I find Sun has alleged facts to state a \nplausible claim that Allergan acted with unclean hands, and that the '516 Patent is therefore \nunenforceable. 5 \nB. SUN'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES \n1. Unclean Hands \nAllergan argues Sun's affirmative defense of unclean hands should be struck under Rule \n12(\u00b1) because Sun failed to plausibly plead its corresponding counterclaim. (D.I. 355 at 9). \nI find that Sun's affirmative defense of unclean hands is properly pied. The pleading \nstandard for an affirmative defense is less demanding than that of a claim or counterclaim. See \nInternet Media Corp. v. Hearst Newspapers, LLC, 2012 WL 3867165, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 6, 2012) \n(noting that affirmative defenses \"need not be plausible to survive\" under Rule 8(c)). Sun states a \nplausible claim that the '516 Patent is unenforceable due to the doctrine of unclean hands. \n4 Even though in Natera unclean hands was pied as an affirmative defense, which just needed to \ncomply with Rule 8(c), and not Rule 8(a)'s Twombly and Iqbal standard, Senju Pharm. Co., v. \nApotex, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 2d 297,303 (D. Del. 2013), Natera is still informative. The court there \nnoted that \"a plausible inference can be drawn from these alleged facts that Natera misused [the] \nconfidential information to obtain claims that it did not invent and then asserted these claims \nagainst Genosity.\" Natera, 2022 WL 767602, at *5. \n5 Sun's Amended Answer states Sun \"reserve[s] the right to rely upon the doctrine of unclean \nhands to bar the enforceability of U.S. Patent Nos. 11,007,179, 11,090,291, 11,160,792, and \n11,229,627.\" (D.I. 349 at 16 n.2). In its Amended Answer, however, Sun has pied that just the \n'516 Patent is unenforceable due to Allergan' s unclean hands. Therefore, my determination that \nSun has stated a claim that Allergan has unclean hands only extends to the '516 Patent. \n\"Reserving a right\" does not plead a counterclaim or an affirmative defense. \n9 Therefore, because Sun alleges the same facts for its affirmative defense, Sun's defense meets the \nRule 8( c) standard. \n2. Prosecution History Estoppel and/or Judicial Estoppel \nAllergan argues that Sun's Fifth Defense of prosecution history estoppel and/or judicial \nestoppel should be \"stricken to the extent that it 're-allege[s] and incorporate[s] by reference' \n[Sun's] unclean hands defense.\" (D.I. 355 at 10 n.3). \nAllergan only seeks to strike this affirmative defense to the extent it re-alleges facts from \nthe unclean hands defense. Because I will not strike the unclean hands affirmative defense, I will \nnot strike the Fifth Defense, either. \n3. Waiver, Estoppel, and Laches \nIn its Answering brief, Sun agrees to withdraw its Sixth Defense of waiver, estoppel, and \n!aches. (D.I. 358 at 1 n.l). Therefore, I will strike it. \n4. Patent Misuse \nAllergan argues that Sun's Seventh Defense of patent misuse should be struck if the \nun.clean hands defense is struck because they rest on the same allegations. (D.I. 355 9-10). \nSince the premise of Allergan' s request is not met, I will not strike the Seventh Defense. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs' motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nAn appropriate order will issue.
