Andrews", "date": "04-28-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nMAYOR MIKE PURZYCKI , et al., \nDefendants. : Civil Action No. 22-167-RGA \nShantell D. Newman, Wilmington , Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nApril 2.$ , 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Shantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 4). She commenced this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983. (D.I. 2 at 5). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) . \nBACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLAN CO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). On January 28, 2022, Plaintiff received an email that her \nvehicle would be towed. (D.I. 2 at 4). She alleges that it is her right to travel using \nordinary vehicles and the deprivation of her vehicle violates her constitutional rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and federal criminal code 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. (D.I. 2 at 5). It is \nnot clear if Plaintiff contacted Defendant Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki or his office to \ncomplain after her car was \"booted\" when she received \"illegal\" tickets from 2014 \ntotaling $600. (Id. at 7). Plaintiff states that the tickets could not possibly belong to her \nbecause the Attorney General's office kidnapped her and she was imprisoned at Baylor \nWomen's Correctional Institution for three years \"2014-2017 -2017-2020 .\" (Id.). \nPlaintiff alleges \"they\" are retaliating because she has called and complained that this is \nnot legal. (Id.). Plaintiff went to the police department (presumably Defendant \nWilmington Police Department) to file a report against the police and was not allowed to \nfile a report or a citizen's complaint. (Id. at 5-6). \n1 Plaintiff seeks discovery and a police investigation , asks that the Mayor's Office \nleave her car alone, and seeks $100,000,000 in damages . \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious , fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \na prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds prose, her \npleading is liberally construed and her Complaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. \nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94. \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless \" or \n\"fantastic or delusional \" factual scenario.\"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \n2 upon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 \nF.3d 103,114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions . \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility . See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 57 4 U.S. 10 (2014 ). A complaint may not \ndismissed , however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted. See id. at 11 . \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations , assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane \nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\" Id. \n3 DISCUSSION \nPersonal Involvement. Mayor Purzycki is a named defendant. The Complaint \ndoes not indicate if Purzycki is named as defendant based upon his position as mayor \nor because he has personal involvement in the matter. \nThere is no respondeat superior liability under \u00a7 1983. See Parke/I v. Danberg, \n833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016). A defendant in a civil rights action cannot be held \nliable unless he had personal involvement. Baraka v. McGreevey , 481 F.3d 187, 210 \n(3d Cir. 2007); see also Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 325 (1981). Such \ninvolvement may be \"shown through allegations of personal direction or of actual \nknowledge and acquiescence .\" Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005). \nTo the extent Plaintiff raises a claim against Purzycki based upon his position as \nmayor, the claim fails as a matter of law. In addition, as pied, it is not clear if what \nactions, if any, were taken by Purzycki. Plaintiff alleges that she contacted the Mayor's \nOffice, that she \"contacted Mike,\" and that the Mayor's office \"committed a tort transfer \naction.\" At most, Plaintiff \"contacted Mike.\" This does not suffice to state a claim. \nTherefore, dismissal is appropriate. \nMunicipal Liability. The Wilmington Police Department is a named defendant.1 \nA municipality may only be held liable under \u00a7 1983 when the \"execution of a \ngovernment 's policy or custom ... inflicts the injury.\" Andrews v. City of Philadelphia , \n895 F.2d 1469, 1480 (3d Cir. 1990). While a government policy is established by a \n\"decisionmaker possessing final authority ,\" a custom arises from a \"course of conduct. . \n1 The proper municipal defendant is the City of Wilmington . \n4 . so permanent and well settled as to virtually constitute law.\" Andrews , 895 F.2d at \n1480 (citing Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, 436 U.S. \n658 (1978)). Accordingly , a plaintiff seeking to recover from a municipality must (1) \nidentify an allegedly unconstitutional policy or custom, (2) demonstrate that the \nmunicipality , through its deliberate and culpable conduct, was the \"moving force\" behind \nthe injury alleged; and (3) demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action \nand the alleged deprivation of federal rights. Board of the County Comm'rs v. Brown, \n520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997). \nPlaintiff has not pied that the Wilmington Police was the \"moving force\" behind \nany alleged constitutional violation. Absent any allegation that a custom or policy \nestablished by the Wilmington Police Department directly caused harm to Plaintiff, her \u00a7 \n1983 claim cannot stand. The claim will be dismissed . \nFederal Criminal Statute. Plaintiff alleges violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. To the \nextent that Plaintiff seeks to impose criminal liability upon Defendants pursuant to the \ncriminal statute upon which she relies, she lacks standing to proceed. See Allen v. \nAdministrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, 270 F. App'x 149, 150 (3d Cir. 2008); see \nUnited States v. Friedland , 83 F.3d 1531, 1539 (3d Cir. 1996) (\"[T]he United States \nAttorney is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases within his or her \ndistrict.\"). The decision of whether to prosecute , and what criminal charges to bring, \ngenerally rests with the prosecutor . See United States v. Batchelder , 442 U.S. 114, 124 \n(1979). Therefore , the criminal claims will be dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a71915(e)(2)(B)(i) . \n5 CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). Plaintiff will be given leave to file an amended \ncomplaint. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nMAYOR MIKE PURZYCKI, et al., \nDefendant. : Civil Action No. 22-167-RGA \nORDER \nAt Wilmington , this 28th day of April, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date; \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(8)(i) \nand (ii). \n2. Plaintiff is given leave to file an amended complaint on or before May 19, \n2022. \n3. The Clerk of Court will be directed to close the case should Plaintiff fail to \ntimely file an amended complaint. "}
