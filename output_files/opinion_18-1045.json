Pro Se Defendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nFebruary a 2023\nWilmington, Delaware\nPlaintiff Alan Edward Dorman, an inmate at the Sussex Correctional Institution\n(\u201cSCI\u2019) in Georgetown, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.1 (D.I.\n3). He appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.1.\n5). The matter proceeds on the Second Amended Complaint. (D.1. 24).2 Before the\nCourt is Defendant Dr. Curtis Harris\u2019s motion for summary judgment. (D.1. 55). The\nmatter is fully briefed.\n\nBACKGROUND AND FACTS PRESENTED BY THE PARTIES\n\nPlaintiff filed this action in July 2018. (D.!. 3). In the Second Amended\nComplaint, Plaintiff brings one claim\u2014an Eighth Amendment claim against Defendant\nfor deliberate indifference to his medical needs related to a finger injury. (D.I. 24).\nPlaintiff injured his finger in August or September 2016 while playing basketball at SCI.4\nOn September 16, 2016, Plaintiff submitted a sick call request for a swollen finger and\nwas seen by a nurse the same day. (D.I. 26 at 15, 19). He told the nurse that he\ninjured his left middle finger playing basketball two weeks prior, that he had set it back\n\nin place, and that swelling had persisted despite icing it. (/d. at 15). The Nurse \u201cbuddy\n\n1 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived\nhim of a federal right, and the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of\nstate law. West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\n\n2 All other Defendants were dismissed by screening orders issued pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a). (D.I. 8, 28).\n\n3 Defendant was represented by counsel when he filed his motion for summary\njudgment, but is now proceeding pro se.\n\n4 Plaintiff has consistently alleged that the injury occurred in mid-August 2016, but his\nmedical records at times suggest it occurred in September 2016.\n: 1\ntaped\u201d the injured finger to an adjacent finger, ordered Motrin, set up \u201ctreatments\u201d to\nmonitor his finger, and placed a referral for an x-ray. (/d.).\n\nIn November 2016, Defendant began working as the Medical Director of SCI as\nan employee of Connections Community Support Systems. (D.1. 54-5 at J 1-2).\nDefendant saw Plaintiff for his finger twice; once on November 22, 2016, and once on\nFebruary 9, 2017. (D.|. 26 at 7, 12). Plaintiffs medical records indicate that between\nSeptember 16, 2016, when he was initially seen by the nurse, and November 22, 2016,\nthe first time he was seen by Defendant, Plaintiff was seen for his finger at least ten\ntimes. (D.I. 26 at 12-16). One of the encounters was on October 18, 2016, with Dr.\nHerman Ellis, who indicated in his note, \u201cr/o [rule out] fracture of left 3rd finger,\u201d and\nordered x-rays. (/d. at 14). Despite the x-ray referral from the first nurse and several\nnurses thereafter, x-rays had not at that time been taken. On October 26, 2016, x-rays\nwere taken. (/d. at 13). The radiology report following the x-rays, which was prepared\nby a medical doctor, stated:\n\nResults: All the carpal joints, metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal and\n\ndistal interphalangeal joints are well aligned. No fracture or dislocation is\n\nseen. No appreciable soft tissue swelling is seen. Conclusion: Normal left\nhand.\n(Id. at 16).\n\nOn November 22, 2016, at his first encounter with Defendant, Plaintiff stated that\nhis finger was still swollen, deformed, and very sore to touch or move, and that\nibuprofen, Mobic, and Tylenol, which he had taken to relieve pain had been ineffective.\n(Id. at 12). Defendant noted that the October x-ray revealed no fracture, dislocation, or\nsoft tissue swelling; his exam found swelling and displacement of the finger due to\n\nPlaintiff's inability to flex it. (/d.). Defendant further noted that the swelling was mild, but\n\nthere was no erythema or warmth, and that radial pulse and capillary refill of the finger\nwere both normal. (/d.). Defendant diagnosed it as a tendon pull with no evidence of\nfracture or ischemia, prescribed stronger medication (Tramadol and Naprosyn), referred\nPlaintiff to physical therapy, and instructed Plaintiff to submit a follow up sick call if there\nwas no improvement. (/d.). After the visit, Defendant apparently failed to enter the\nmedical orders for Tramadol and Naprosyn, but did so on November 29, 2016, after it\nwas brought to his attention by a nurse. (/d.).\n\nOn November 29, 2016, an appointment was made for Plaintiff to begin physical\ntherapy, and he had his physical therapy first session on December 27, 2016. (/d. at\n11). Thereafter, Plaintiff had physical therapy sessions on December 28, December 30,\nJanuary 3, January 5, January 6, January 12, January 13, January 19, and February 1,\n2017, and continued to take Tramadol and Naprosyn for his pain. (/d. at 7-10).\nThroughout these physical therapy sessions, Plaintiff generally complained of a lack of\nimprovement. (/d.).\n\nOn February 9, 2017, Defendant saw Plaintiff for his finger injury for the second\nand final time. There is some confusion in the medical notes from that day. After\nPlaintiff complained that his \u201cfinger just turned purple and [he] could not feel it,\u201d he was\nseen by a nurse who noted that it was his left middle finger (i.e., the same injured\nfinger). (Id. at 7). The nurse noted that a different nurse had confirmed Plaintiff's\ncomplaint that his finger had turned purple and he could not feel it, but that by the time\nhe got to the infirmary, the color was normal, capillary refill was brisk, and Plaintiff\nreported that he had regained feeling in the finger. (/d.). The physical therapist who\nwas working with Plaintiff then \u201cassessed and manipulated the finger.\u201d (/d.). The nurse\n\nnoted also that Defendant agreed to see Plaintiff that day. (/d.). Oddly, Defendant\u2019s\n/\n3\n\nnotes from the same day correctly located the issue as being with Plaintiff's left middle\nfinger, but treated it as a unique event, incorrectly stating that the torn tendon for which\nPlaintiff was receiving physical therapy was in his right middle finger. (/d.). Defendant\nrecommended that Plaintiff continue with physical therapy, and noted that he would\n\u201cconfer with physical therapist regarding prognosis and probability of return of extensor\nfunction of third digit of right hand.\u201d (/d. at 7).\n\nFrom February 9, 2017 through March 8, 2017, Plaintiff continued to have regular\nphysical therapy sessions, and to take Tramadol and Naprosyn for his pain. (/d. at 5-7).\nHe again generally complained about lack of improvement. (/d.). Following Plaintiff's\nMarch 8, 2017 physical therapy session, during which Plaintiff stated that something still\nwas not right with hand, the physical therapist discharged Plaintiff from physical therapy\nbased on the lack of significant change or improvement, and sent an email to the nurse\npractitioner and medical doctor (presumably Defendant), recommending that Plaintiff be\nseen again and possibly referred \u201cto hand specialist/ortho MD.\u201d (/d. at 5). On March\n21, 2017, Plaintiff was seen by a nurse, who submitted a consult for him to be seen by\nan orthopedist. (/d. at 4-5).\n\nOn April 26, 2017, Plaintiff was seen at an orthopedic practice. (/d. at 4). An office\nnote signed by Dr. Thomas Otter stated that x-rays taken that day showed that the finger\nhad been fractured but that the \u201cfracture is healed nicely on our x-ray so that is not a\nclinical problem at this point in time,\u201d that Plaintiff was \u201csuffering from scar tissue in the\nvolar aspect of the finger,\u201d which \u201cprevents full active range of motion of the finger,\u201d and\nconcluded that \u201ccontinued exercises are the best regime to try to rehabilitate the hand.\u201d\n\n(Id. at 38). On May 2, 2017, Plaintiff had a follow up visit with the nurse at SCI, at which\n\nshe noted that the plan of care was to continue to use his finger as much as possible and\ncontinue with exercises. (/d. at 3).\n\nDefendant now seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff's deliberate indifference\nclaim.\n\nLEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 56(c) requires the court to \u201cgrant summary judgment if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\" The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v.\nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86 (1986). The burden then shifts to the\nnonmoving party to show that there is a \u201cgenuine issue for trial.\u201d Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986).\n\nA fact in dispute is material when it \"might affect the outcome of the suit under\nthe governing law\" and is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could\nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n242, 248 (1986). \"In considering a motion for summary judgment, a district court may\nnot make credibility determinations or engage in any weighing of the evidence; instead,\nthe nonmoving party's evidence \u2018is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be\ndrawn in his favor.\u201d Marino v. Industrial Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004)\n(quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255). A court's role in deciding a motion for summary\njudgment is not to evaluate the evidence and decide the truth of the matter but rather \"to\ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.\n\nWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to\n\nfind for the nonmoving party, there is no \u201cgenuine issue for trial.\u201d The mere\nexistence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat\n\n5\n\nan otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the\n\nrequirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact. When\n\nopposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly\n- contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a\n\ncourt should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\nScott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) (citations, quotations, and alterations omitted).\nDISCUSSION\n\nDefendant moves for summary judgment, arguing that there are no genuine\nissues of material fact, given that Plaintiffs deliberate indifference claim merely\nchallenges the adequacy of the care he indisputably received from Defendant on the\ngrounds that it was different than the treatment Plaintiff would have selected. In\nresponse, Plaintiff argues that the record evinces genuine issues of material fact that\nDefendant was deliberately indifferent by: (1) taking a conservative approach to his\ntreatment that was \u201cso inappropriate for a fractured finger\u201d (D.I. 59 at 2-3) (cleaned up),\nand (2) delaying referral to an orthopedist, which caused permanent damage to his\nfinger (id. at 3).\n\nThe Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment\nrequires that prison officials provide inmates with adequate medical care. Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103-05 (1976). In order to set forth a cognizable claim, an inmate\nmust allege (i) a serious medical need and (ii) acts or omissions by prison officials that\nindicate deliberate indifference to that need. /d. at 104; Rouse v. Plantier, 182 F.3d\n192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999). A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he or she knows\nthat a prisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable\n\nsteps to avoid the harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). A prisoner has\n\nno right to choose a specific form of medical treatment. Lasko v. Watts, 373 F. App'x\n\n196, 203 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Harrison v. Barkley, 219 F.3d 132, 136 (2d Cir. 2000)).\n\u201cMere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment is also insufficient\" to state a\nconstitutional violation. Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 235 (3d Cir. 2004) (cleaned up).\nTreatment is presumed to be proper. [A]s long as a physician exercises professional\njudgment his behavior will not violate a prisoner's constitutional rights.\u201d Brown v.\nBorough of Chambersburg, 903 F.2d 274, 278 (3d Cir. 1990).\n\nA prison official may manifest deliberate indifference by \u201cintentionally denying or\ndelaying access to medical care.\u201d Estelle, 429 U.S. at 103-05. \u201cUnlike the deliberate\nindifference prong of an adequacy of care claim (which involves both an objective and\nsubjective inquiry), the deliberate indifference prong of a delay or denial of medical\ntreatment claim involves only one subjective inquiry\u2014since there is no presumption that\nthe defendant acted properly, it lacks the objective, propriety of medical treatment,\nprong of an adequacy of care claim.\" Pearson v. Prison Health Serv., 850 F.3d 526,\n537 (3d Cir. 2017). Thus, rather than requiring extrinsic proof to establish deliberate\nindifference based on a delay or denial of medical treatment, \u201c[a]ll that is needed is for\nthe surrounding circumstances to be sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that\nthe delay or denial was motivated by non-medical factors.\" /d.\n\nThe following is undisputed\u2014Defendant saw Plaintiff for his finger on just two\noccasions, evaluated his injury based on x-rays and physical examinations, and\nprescribed him medication for his pain and physical therapy. Given these basic facts,\nclearly demonstrating the provision of care by Defendant, Plaintiff has a nearly\n\ninsurmountable task staving off summary judgment.5 Indeed, Defendant correctly\n\n5 There is some confusion regarding Defendant's note following their second encounter.\n(D.I. 26 at 7). It references numbness in the left middle finger and a tendon tear in the\n7\n\nasserts, \u201cThe only medical evidence in this case indicates that the care rendered to Mr.\nDorman was reasonable based on his presentation and the objective findings that were\npresent.\u201d (D.I. 56 at 13) (emphasis in original).\n\nTo support his claim, Plaintiff references two pieces of evidence from the record.\nThe first is Dr. Ellis\u2019s October 18, 2016 note ordering an x-ray to rule out a fracture. The\nsecond is the April 26, 2017 orthopedic note, which stated that x-rays taken that day\nshowed that the finger had been fractured and that, despite the fracture healing nicely,\nPlaintiff was suffering from \u201cscar tissue in the volar aspect of the finger,\u201d which was\n\u201cpreventting] full active range of motion of the finger.\u201d\n\nWith regard to the October 18, 2016 note from Dr. Ellis, Plaintiff appears to be\nunder the impression that Dr. Ellis diagnosed a fracture, which contradicted the opinion\nof Defendant (and the non-defendant medical doctor who authored the radiology report\nfollowing the October 26, 2016 x-ray) that there was no fracture. Even if Dr. Ellis had\ndiagnosed a fracture, rather than just calling for an x-ray to rule out a fracture (as the\nrecord indicates he did), this would not constitute a genuine issue of material fact as it\nwould be insufficient to establish a deliberate indifference claim against Defendant. See\nWhite v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 110 (3d Cir. 1990) (\u201cIf a plaintiffs disagreement with a\ndoctor's professional judgment does not state a violation of the Eighth Amendment, then\n\ncertainly no claim is stated when a doctor disagrees with the professional judgment of\n\nright middle finger. This appears to be a record-keeping mistake, since there is no\nindication that Plaintiff had a right middle finger injury. This mistake falls well short of\nwhat is necessary to establish a deliberate indifference claim. See Spruill, 372 F.3d at\n235 (\u201cAllegations of medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a Constitutional\nviolation.\u201d). The same is true of Defendant's apparent failure to enter the medical\norders for the pain medication he prescribed after their first encounter, resulting in a\nweek-long delay.\n\n8\n\nanother doctor. There may, for example, be several acceptable ways to treat an\nillness.\"); see also Hairston v. Dir. Bureau of Prisons, 563 F. App\u2019x 893, 895 (3d Cir.\nApr. 16, 2014) (per curiam) (\u201cNo claim of deliberate indifference is made out where a\nsignificant level of care has been provided, and all that is shown is . . . that a different\nphysician has in the past taken a different approach to the prisoner's treatment\u2019).\n\nPlaintiff's argument that the April 26, 2017 orthopedic note creates a genuine\nissue of material fact regarding a delay in treatment is also mistaken. This is simply\nanother attempt at claiming that Defendant provided inadequate care by not diagnosing\na fracture. See, e.g., Pearson, 850 F.3d at 538-39 (\u201c[While Pearson claims that Nurse\nThomas delayed or denied him medical care, it is undisputed that she examined him,\ndiagnosed him with a pulled muscle, and decided not to elevate his condition based on\nher opinion that it was not severe. Thus, his claim against her is one that she\ninadequately diagnosed and treated his medical condition.\u201d). Rather than \u201cthe\nsurrounding circumstances\u201d being such that a reasonable jury could find that \u201cnon-\nmedical factors\u201d were responsible for the purported delay in referring Plaintiff to an\northopedist,\u201d see id. at 537, the record, including the conclusion in the radiology report\nthat there was no fracture, the rigorous course of physical therapy, and the prescription\nof stronger medication for the pain, demonstrate that Defendant was exercising his\nprofessional judgment in assessing the injury and providing care.\n\nThe Third Circuit has instructed that, \u201cbecause the deliberate indifference\nstandard \u2018affords considerable latitude to prison medical authorities in the diagnosis and\ntreatment of the medical problems of inmate patients,\u2019 [courts] must \u2018disavow any\nattempt to second-guess the propriety or adequacy of [their] particular course of\n\ntreatment\u2019 so long as it \u2018remains a question of sound professional judgment.\u201d /d. at 538\n\n9\n(quoting Inmates of Allegheny Cnty. Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754, 762 (3d Cir. 1979)\n(second alteration in original). On this record, second guessing Defendant's\nprofessional judgment would be wholly improper.\n\nAccordingly, no reasonable jury could find that Defendant was deliberately\nindifferent to Plaintiffs serious medical needs in providing treatment or by reason of an\n\nintentional delay or denial of medical care on the claims raised under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\n\nPlaintiff's amended complaint does not raise a medical negligence claim under\nDelaware law. Nor could it. Such a claim is governed by the Delaware Health Care\nNegligence Insurance and Litigation Act. 18 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 6801-6865. When a party |\nalleges medical negligence, Delaware law requires the party to produce an affidavit of\nmerit with expert medical testimony detailing: (1) the applicable standard of care, (2) the\nalleged deviation from that standard, and (3) the causal link between the deviation and\nthe alleged injury. Bonesmo v. Nemours Foundation, 253 F. Supp. 2d 801, 804 (D. Del.\n\n2003); 18 Del. C.\u00a7 6853. Plaintiff did not submit an affidavit of merit signed by an expert\nwitness at the time he filed his Complaint. See 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853(a)(1). Therefore, the\npossibility of such claim raises no bar to granting Defendant\u2019s motion.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will grant Defendant\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n10\n"}
