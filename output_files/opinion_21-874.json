Civil Action No. 21-874-SRF\nLOGAN SPICER, et al.,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION!\n\nIL INTRODUCTION\n\nPresently before the court in this civil rights action is the motion of Defendants Logan\nSpicer (\u201cOfficer Spicer\u201d), Nathaniel Weir (\u201cOfficer Weir\u201d), and Scott Hurd (\u201cCorporal Hurd\u201d)\n(collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) to dismiss the original complaint for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (D.I. 16)? and\nthe motion of Plaintiff Daniel Davis, III (\u201cMr. Davis\u201d) for leave to file a first amended complaint\n(D.I. 23). For the following reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is DENIED without\n\nprejudice and Plaintiff's motion to amend is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART.\n\n! The parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge to conduct all proceedings in this\nmatter through final judgment, and the case was assigned to the undersigned judicial officer on\nAugust 6, 2021. (D.I. 15)\n\n2 The briefing for the present motion to dismiss is as follows: Defendants\u2019 opening brief (D.I.\n17), Plaintiff\u2019s answering brief (D.I. 18), and Defendants\u2019 reply brief (D.I. 19).\n\n3 The briefing for the present motion to amend is as follows: Plaintiff's opening brief (D.I. 23),\nDefendants\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 25), and Plaintiff's reply brief (D.I. 26).\n\nIL. BACKGROUND\n\na. Facts\u2018\n\nOn June 24, 2019, Gas Recovery, LLC (\u201cGas Recovery\u201d), acting on behalf of the lender\nwho financed the vehicle, Santander Consumer USA Inc. d/b/a Chrysler Capital, attempted to\nrepossess Mr. Davis\u2019 vehicle without first obtaining a court order. (D.I. 1 at 9] 12-13, 15) Mr.\nDavis objected to the repossession peacefully, but Gas Recovery called City of Dover Police\nDepartment (\u201cDover Police\u201d) for assistance. (/d. at {J 18-19) Officers Spicer and Weir and\nCorporal Hurd, Dover Police Officers, arrived at the scene, and one or more of them instructed\nMr. Davis to leave his vehicle. (/d. J 8-10, 19-21) When Mr. Davis refused, Defendants forcibly\nremoved him from his vehicle, deployed tasers at least twice, and arrested and charged him with\nvarious offenses in connection with his objection to the repossession. (/d. at 21) Plaintiff filed\na Notice of Certification in Further Opposition of Motion to Quash on September 27, 2021, in\nthe related case, C.A. No. 20-840-SRF, in which Mr. Davis indicated that the Court of Common\nPleas of Kent County, Delaware dismissed nolle prosequi with prejudice Mr. Davis\u2019 criminal\ncharges on September 22, 2021. (See C.A. No. 20-840-SRF, D.I. 43)\u00b0\n\nb. Procedural History\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Mr. Davis filed a complaint (the \u201coriginal complaint\u201d) in the District\n\nof Delaware against Officer Spicer, Officer Weir, Corporal Hurd, and John Does 1-4 in their\n\n4 The facts in this section are based upon allegations in the original complaint, which the court\naccepts as true for the purposes of the instant motions. See Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n5 See Davis v. Gas Recovery, LLC, et al., C.A. No. 20-840, an action against the lender,\nSantander Consumer USA Inc. d/b/a Chrysler Capital, and repossession company hired by the\nlender, Gas Recovery, LLC, for alleged negligence, wrongful repossession, conversion, and\ntrespass in violation of Mr. Davis\u2019 rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1692, et seg., and Delaware\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code, 6 Del. C. \u00a7 9-609, et seq.\n2 :\nindividual capacities. (D.I. 1) Mr. Davis in the original complaint alleges that Defendants\ndeprived him of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\nby unlawfully assisting in the repossession of his vehicle, forcibly removing him from his\nvehicle, deploying tasers, and arresting him on \u201cmultiple bogus charges.\u201d (/d. at {J 20-21, 24-\n28, 31) Mr. Davis alleges that Defendants knew that neither Gas Recovery nor Chrysler had\nobtained a court order or similar writ to repossess Mr. Davis\u2019 vehicle. (/d. at $f] 25, 39) It\nfurther alleges that Defendants knowingly, intentionally, and willfully used excessive force,\narrested Mr. Davis without probable cause or a warrant, and detained Mr. Davis without legal\nauthority or justification. (/d. at J] 41-43) As a result of Defendants\u2019 conduct, Mr. Davis claims\nhe lost his primary mode of transportation and has suffered, inter alia, physical injuries,\npecuniary loss, and emotional distress. (Id. at ]30) Mr. Davis seeks nominal, compensatory,\nand punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. (id. at 44)\n\nOn August 13, 2021, Defendants moved to dismiss the original complaint in its entirety\nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6). (D.I. 16) The court entered a Scheduling Order on September 8, 2021, requiring all\nmotions to amend the pleadings be filed on or before December 3, 2021. (D.L. 21 at 2) On\nDecember 3, 2021, Mr. Davis filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint (the\n\u201camended complaint\u201d). (D.I. 23) Mr. Davis in the amended complaint proposes to add detail\nregarding each Defendant\u2019s use of excessive force and involvement in the repossession and\nalleges that Defendants also violated his First Amendment rights. (D.I. 23, Ex. 1 at FJ 4, 22, 24-\n25, 31, 50, 54, 63) Mr. Davis seeks amendment to include additional civil rights violations under\nSection 1983 and an additional Dover Police Defendant, Corporal Mark Guiteras (\u201cCorporal\n\nGuiteras\u201d), alleging that the Gas Recovery \u201crepo man\u201d captured the entire incident on video, but\n3\n\nthat Defendants conspired to cover up any wrongdoing by preparing a police report containing\nmultiple falsehoods and directing the \u201crepo man\u201d to destroy video evidence of the repossession.\n(Ud. at J] 1, 6-7, 14, 26, 36-42, 44, 47, 53) Mr. Davis also alleges that he was falsely arrested\nand maliciously prosecuted because his related criminal charges were dismissed with prejudice\nafter the original complaint was filed. (/d. at [] 35, 38-40, 43-46, 48, 62-64)\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\na. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15\n\nRule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a party may amend its\npleading after a responsive pleading has been filed \u201conly with the opposing party\u2019s written\nconsent or the court\u2019s leave,\u201d and \u201c[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The decision to grant or deny leave to amend lies within the court\u2019s\ndiscretion. See Foman vy. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); In re Burlington Coat Factory Secs.\nLitig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997). The Third Circuit has adopted a liberal approach to\nthe amendment of pleadings. See Dole v. Arco, 921 F.2d 484, 486-87 (3d Cir. 1990). In the\nabsence of undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motives on the part of the moving party, the\namendment should be freely granted, unless it is futile or unfairly prejudicial to the non-moving\nparty. See Foman, 371 U.S. at 182; In re Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1434.\n\nRule 15(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an amendment to a\npleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the amendment arises out of the\n\u201cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\u201d set out in the original pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n15(c)(1)(B). For an amendment that adds a party to relate back, the plaintiff must also satisfy\nadditional conditions, including establishing that the party to be added, within the period\n\nprovided by Rule 4(m), received \u201csuch notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in\n4\ndefending on the merits.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(I)(C); See Arthur v. Maersk, Inc., 434 F.3d 196,\n207 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\nb. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint\nand view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\ny, Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\n\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted), This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\n5\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Jgbal, 556 U.S. at\n679.\nIv. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Motion to Amend\n\nWithin the deadline for amending pleadings set by the court in the scheduling order, Mr.\nDavis moves to amend on the basis that discovery has revealed additional civil rights violations.\n(D.L. 23; D.I. 21 at {2) Namely, Mr. Davis claims an alleged conspiracy among the Dover\nPolice Defendants to conceal their alleged wrongdoing by destroying video evidence that would\nhave revealed the use of force as alleged in the original complaint and misrepresentations in the\npolice incident report that resulted in Mr. Davis\u2019 alleged false arrest and criminal prosecution on\ngroundless charges dismissed on the day of trial. (D.I. 23, Ex. 1 at \u00a7f 1, 6-7, 26, 35-48, 53, 62-\n64) Mr. Davis claims the facts underlying the alleged conspiracy could not have been discovered\nuntil he appeared for his criminal trial. (/d. at {| 44-47)\n\nMr. Davis has incorporated the conspiracy allegations into the factual background of the\nproposed first amended complaint and the Section 1983 civil rights claim in Count I by adding a\nclaim that Defendants \u201cconspired\u201d to deprive Mr. Davis of his rights. (/d. at f{] 35-50, 53)\nFurthermore, Mr. Davis seeks to add another Dover Police Officer, Corporal Guiteras, as an\nadditional Defendant. (/d. at J 14)\n\nDefendants oppose the amendment to add conspiracy to the original civil rights Count on\nthe basis that it is time-barred and does not relate back to the filing of the original complaint.\n(D.I. 25 at 4-9) Defendants oppose adding another Dover Police Officer as a new Defendant for\nthe same reasons and because the party to be added never received notice as required under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 15(c)(1(C\\D. Ud.)\n\nThe court will first address the conspiracy claim. It is undisputed that the statute of\nlimitations ran on Mr. Davis\u2019 civil rights claim on June 24, 2021. Delaware\u2019s two-year statute of\nlimitations for personal injury applies to cases arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 10 Del. C. \u00a7\n8119; see also McDowell v. Del. State Police, 88 F.3d 188, 190-91 (3d Cir. 1996); Daoud v. City\nof Wilmington, 894 F Supp.2d 544, 557 (D. Del. 2012) (\u201cSection 1983 does not itself provide a\nstatute of limitations; rather, the applicable statute of limitations is the state\u2019s statute of\nlimitations governing personal injury claims\u201d). \u201cA section 1983 claim accrues when the plaintiff\nknows or has reason to know of the injury that forms the basis of his cause of action.\u201d Carr v.\nTown of Dewey Beach, 730 F. Supp. 591, 603 (D. Del. 1990). Thus, Mr. Davis\u2019 proposed\namended complaint, filed December 3, 2021, falls outside the scope of the applicable two-year\nstatute of limitations. (D.I. 23, Ex. 1)\n\nHowever, the court finds the conspiracy claim relates back to the original complaint. See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B); \u00b0 See also Mayle v, Felix, 545 U.S. 644, 659 (2005) (\u201crelation back\ndepends on the existence of a common \u2018core of operative facts\u2019 uniting the original and newly\nasserted claims\u201d). The proposed conspiracy claim is dependent upon and arises out of the\noccurrence set forth in the original complaint as the claims for the civil rights violations and\nconspiracy to conceal it relate to the underlying alleged unlawful repossession of Mr. Davis\u2019\nvehicle. (D.I. 1 at Jf 21, 24-28, 31; D.I. 23, Ex. 1 at {4 35-50) The conspiracy claim alleges that\nthe Dover Police Officers concealed their wrongdoing by destroying video evidence that would\nhave revealed their violations of Mr. Davis\u2019 civil rights, misrepresented facts in the police\n\nincident report, and falsely arrested and prosecuted Mr. Davis. (D.L. 23, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 1, 6-7, 26,\n\n\u00a7 \u201cAn amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when: the\namendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set\nout \u2014 or attempted to be set out \u2014 in the original pleading.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).\n\n7\n\n35-48, 53, 62-64) Mr. Davis asserts that the conspiracy was not revealed until he appeared on\nSeptember 22, 2021 to face the charges on which he was being prosecuted and learned of the\nalleged conspiracy to cover-up evidence that resulted in dismissal of the charges on the day of\ntrial. (id. at 44-47) Thus, the conspiracy relates to and arises from the civil rights violations\nalleged in the original complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). Mr. Davis moved to amend\nwithin the time allowed by the court. (D.I. 21 at \u00a2 2) Therefore, the amendment is not time-\nbarred, and the court will allow it.\n\nNotwithstanding the relation back of the alleged conspiracy to deprive Mr. Davis of his\nrights, the court will not permit Mr. Davis to add another Dover Police Officer, Corporal\nGuiteras, as a Defendant. Mr. Davis makes no effort to argue in his opening or reply brief how\nsuch an amendment is proper under Rule 15,\u2019 arguing instead that the court apply equitable\ntolling. (D.I. 23; D.I. 26 at 3-5) However, the Third Circuit in Urrutia v. Harrisburg Cty. Police\nDep\u2019t held that \u201c[a]n amendment to the complaint in which specific police officers would be\nnamed as additional defendants...would have cured the [statute of limitations] defect, if it related\nback under Rule 15(c).\u201d Urrutia v. Harrisburg Cty. Police Dep\u2019t, 91 F.3d 451, 453 (3d Cir.\n\n1996). The court explained that \u201c[a]mong the several conditions in Rule 15(c) that must be\n\n7 For an amendment that \u201cchanges the party or the naming of a party against whom a claim is\nasserted,\u201d the Plaintiff has the burden of establishing that \u201c(1) the claim in the amended pleading\narises out of the \u2018conduct, transaction, or occurrence\u2019 set forth in the original pleading; (2) within\n[90] days of institution of the action, the party to be brought in by amendment must have\nreceived \u2018such notice of the...action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a\ndefense on the merits\u2019; and, (3) within [90] days of institution of the action, the party to be\nbrought in by amendment must have known or should have known that, \u2018but for a mistake\nconcerning the identity of the proper party,\u2019 the action would have been brought against that\nparty.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C); See Arthur, 434 F.3d at 207. \u201cBecause this rule is\nconjunctive, Plaintiff must prove each of the three factors.\u201d Averill v. Jones, C.A. No, 12-599-\nMN, 2019 WL 3804686, at *3 (D. Del. Aug. 13, 2019) (citing Singletary v. Pennsylvania Dept.\nof Corr., 266 F.3d 186, 194 (3d Cir. 2001)).\n\n8\n\nsatisfied for an amendment to relate back is that the individuals to be added as defendants must\nreceive such notice of the institution of the action within [90] days of the filing of the complaint\nthat they will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits.\u201d Jd.; See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n15(c)(1)(C)@); See also Fetterman v. Westmoreland Cty. Childrens Bureau, 681 Fed. Appx. 166,\n169 (3d Cir. 2017) (\u201c[i]n order to add new parties to a timely commenced action outside of this\nlimitations period, an amended pleading must \u2018relate back\u2019 to the original pleading under Rule\n15(c)\u201d). The court finds that Mr. Davis has not met his burden to add another Dover Police\nDefendant six months after the statute of limitations expired on his claim because it is undisputed\nin the record that the party to be added received no notice. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C)@).\nMr. Davis\u2019 motion is silent on the prejudice this particular Defendant would suffer in this\ninstance if he were added to this suit well past the expiration of the statute of limitations. See\nUrrutia, 91 F.3d at 453-54. Mr. Davis has not attempted to address Rule 15, the prejudice to\nCorporal Guiteras, or even plead any substantive basis to add the new Defendant in the proposed\namended complaint, naming him only in the case caption and list of parties. (D.I. 23, Ex. 1 at 1,\n114)\n\nThe court is not persuaded by Mr. Davis\u2019 attempt to avoid the consequences of Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 15(c)(1)(C) by arguing that equitable tolling based on fraudulent concealment operates to\n\nprevent his claims against a new Defendant, Corporal Guiteras, from being time-barred.? \u201cThe\n\n8 Equitable tolling based on the \u201cfraudulent concealment doctrine operates to stop the statute of\nlimitations from running in circumstances when the accrual date of a claim has passed but the\n\u2018plaintiff's cause of action has been obscured by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u2019\u201d In re Cmty. Bank of\nN. Virginia Mortg. Lending Pracs. Litig., 795 F.3d 380, 400-01 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting Jn re\nLinerboard Antitrust Litig., 305 F.3d 145, 160 Gd Cir. 2002)); See also Dickens v. Taylor, 671 F.\nSupp. 2d 542, 547 (D. Del. 2009) (holding that equitable tolling may be applied to \u201csuits brought\nunder federal civil rights statutes when the state statute of limitations would otherwise frustrate\nfederal policy\u201d). The plaintiff has the burden of proving fraudulent concealment, which requires\n9\n2\n\nremedy of equitable tolling is extraordinary, and we extend it \u2018only sparingly.\u2019\u201d Santas ex rel.\nBeato v. U.S., 559 F.3d 189, 197 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Irwin v. Dept. of Veteran Affairs, 498\nU.S. 89, 96 (1990)). Mr. Davis recites perfunctory reasons as to why he did not know about\nCorporal Guiteras\u2019 part in the alleged conspiracy, but does not make an affirmative showing of\nany of the three elements of equitable tolling based on fraudulent concealment. See Cetel, 460\nF.3d at 509. Importantly, there is no showing of any \u201cdue diligence efforts in attempting to\nuncover the relevant facts\u201d as required to show the applicability of equitable tolling based on\nfraudulent concealment. Jd.\n\nTherefore, the proposed amendment to add Corporal Guiteras as a Defendant is time-\nbarred, and Mr. Davis\u2019 motion to amend is denied-in-part. Mr. Davis\u2019 motion to amend as it\nrelates to the conspiracy claim is granted-in-part. An amended complaint that complies with this\nMemorandum Opinion shall be filed within five (5) days. Defendants shall file a responsive\npleading within five (5) days of service of the amended complaint.\n\nB. Motion to Dismiss\n\nDefendants seek dismissal of the original complaint on two grounds: (1) Mr. Davis does |\nnot adequately plead the individual actions taken by each officer in order to sustain a cause of\naction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and (2) Mr. Davis does not allege any facts to support an award\nof punitive damages. (D.I. 17) Having granted-in-part Mr. Davis\u2019 motion for leave to file the\namended complaint (D.I. 23), Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the original complaint is moot. See\n\nStandard Chlorine of Del., Inc. v. Sinibaldi, 821 F. Supp. 232, 239-40 (D. Del. 1992) (holding\n\na three-part showing: \u201c(1) that the defendant actively misled the plaintiff; (2) which prevented\nthe plaintiff from recognizing the validity of her claim within the limitations period; and (3) |\nwhere the plaintiff's ignorance is not attributable to her lack of reasonable due diligence in /\nattempting to uncover the relevant facts.\u201d Cetel v. Kirwan Fin. Grp., 460 F.3d 494, 509 (3d Cir.\n2006). .\n\n10\nthat where a party filed an amended complaint, a motion to dismiss the original complaint was\nrendered moot). Therefore, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is denied without prejudice.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 16) is DENIED without\nprejudice and Plaintiffs motion to amend (D.I. 23) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-\n\nPART.\n\nDated: March { , 2022\n\n11\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nDANIEL DAVIS, II, )\nPlaintiff,\nv.
