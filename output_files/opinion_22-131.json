WILLIAMS \nU.S. DISTRICT JUDGE \nBefore the Court in this civil action for patent infringement is Plaintiff Mentone Solutions \nLLC's (\"Mentone\") Motion for Default Judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n55(b)(2) against Defendant Cobham Technologies , Inc. (\"Cobham\"). D.I. 12. For the reasons \nbelow, the Court will DENY Mentone's Motion for Default Judgment. \nI. BACKGROUND \nMentone filed this action on January 29, 2022, alleging that Cobham infringed U.S. Patent \nNo. 6,952,413 (\"the '413 patent\") by making, using, and selling, during the lifetime of the '413 \npatent, \"a series of products identified as the Explorer 540 BGAN M2M\" (the \"Accused \nInstrumentalities\") . D.I. 1 at ,r 11. Mentone alleges that Cobham's Accused Instrumentalities \n\"necessarily and inherently \" require practicing the method of at least claim 5 of the '413 patent, \nthereby entitling Mentone to monetary damages in the form of a reasonable royalty rate. Id at ,r,r \n12, 15. Mentone served its Complaint and Summons to Cobham by way of its registered agent on \nFebruary 7, 2022. D.I. 5. \nCobham failed to file and serve a timely responsive pleading or motion as required under \nRule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On April 26, 2022, at Mentone's request (D.I. \n10), the Clerk of Court entered the default in appearance against Cobham pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 55(a) (the \"Entry of Default,\" D.I. 11). One day later, Mentone served the \nEntry of Default (D.I. 11) to Cobham by way of its registered agent. On June 3, 2022, Mentone \nfiled its Motion for Default Judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2). D.I. \n12. \n2 \u2022 \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nDefault judgments are generally disfavored in the Third Circuit. Budget Blinds, Inc. v. \nWhite, 536 F.3d 244, 258 (3d Cir.2008). However, the decision to enter a default judgment \nultimately lies within the discretion of the court. Tristrata Tech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy \nResearch, Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D. Del. 2010) (citing Hritz v. Woma Corp., 732 F.2d 1178, \n1180 (3d Cir. 1984)). Entry of default judgment is a two-step process. Tristrata Tech., 270 F.R.D. \nat 164. First, the party seeking a default judgment must request that the Clerk of Court enter default \nagainst the party that has failed to answer the pleading or otherwise defend itself in the action. See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 55(a); see also J & J Sports Prod., Inc. v. Kim, No. 14-1170, 2016 WL 1238223, \nat *1 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2016). After default has been entered, a plaintiff may obtain a default \njudgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b); see also J & J Sports Prod., 2016 WL 1238223, at *I. If the \nplaintiff is seeking relief in the form of a sum certain , it may obtain a default judgment from the \nClerk of Court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(l); see also J & J Sports Prod., 2016 WL 1238223, at *I. \nOtherwise , \"the party seeking default judgment must apply to the court for an entry of default \njudgment.\" Tristrata Tech., 270 F.R.D. at 164. \nBefore entering a default judgment , the Court must decide whether \"the unchallenged \nfacts constitute a legitimate cause of action, since a party in default does not admit mere \nconclusions oflaw.\" Chanel, Inc. v. Gordashevsky, 558 F. Supp. 2d 532,535 (D.N.J. 2008) (citing \nlOA Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure\u00a7 2688, at 63 (3d ed. 1998)). The \ncourt considers three factors when determining if default judgment is appropriate: \"(I) prejudice \nto the plaintiff if default is denied, (2) whether the defendant appears to have a litigable defense, \nand (3) whether defendant 's delay is due to culpable conduct.\" Chamberlain v. Giampapa , 210 \nF .3d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 2000). In assessing these factors, \"the factual allegations of the complaint , \n3 \u2022 \nexcept those relating to the amount of damages, will be taken as true.\" Genedics , LLC v. Meta \nCo., No. 17-1062, 2019 WL 3802650, at *3 (D. Del. Aug. 13, 2019) (quoting Comdyne L Inc. v. \nCorbin, 908 F.2d 1142, 1149 (3d Cir. 1990)). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nThe relevant factors weigh against entering default judgment on Mentone's patent \ninfringement claim. Although the Court must take Mentone's factual allegations as true, see \nGenedics, 2019 WL 3802650, at *3, these factual allegations-which can charitably be described \nas sparse-fail to establish that Cobham infringed the '413 patent. Specifically, Mentone's \nComplaint fails to establish that Cobham made, used, or sold the Accused Instrumentalities in the \nUnited States as required to state a claim for direct infringement pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a). \nSee MEMC Elec. Materials , Inc. v. Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp., 420 F.3d 1369, 1375 (Fed. \nCir. 2005) (holding that direct infringement liability pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a) is \"limited to \ninfringing activities that occur within the United States.\"). Thus, the Court cannot conclude that \n\"the unchallenged facts constitute a legitimate cause of action\" for direct patent infringement. See \nChanel, 558 F. Supp. 2d at 535. As such, Mentone's Motion for Default Judgment is denied. \nMentone may seek leave to file an amended pleading.1 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n1 Because the Clerk of Court's Entry of Default (D .I. 11) is premised on factual allegations from \nMentone's Complaint (D.I. 1), the Court must vacate as moot the Clerk of Court's Entry of Default \nif Mentone files an Amended Complaint. \n4 "}
