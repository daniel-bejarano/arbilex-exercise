Geisenberger, in his capacity \nas the Secretary of Finance for the State of Delaware, Brenda R. Mayrack, in her capacity as the \nState Escheator of the State of Delaware, and Brian R. Wishnow in his capacity as the Assistant Director \u2013 Enforcement of the Department of Finance for the State of Delaware ( collectively \n\u201cDefendants\u201d or \u201cthe State\u201d)  from enfo rcing the subpoena (\u201c the Subpoena\u201d) that was the subject \nof the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s April 7, 2022 Final Order Granting Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings ( \u201cthe Final State Court Order\u201d) .  The motion  has been fully briefed \n(D.I. 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93) and the Court heard telephonic argument (D.I. 99 (Tr.)).  \nFor the following reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiff\u2019s motion.\n2  This opinion constitutes the \nCourt\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules  of Civil \nProcedure.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Delaware Unclaimed Property Law  \nThis case is yet another in a line concerning Delaware\u2019s Escheat Law, commonly referred \nto as the Delaware Unclaimed Property Law or \u201cUPL.\u201d  12 Del. C . \u00a7 1101 et seq .  This Court has \ndiscussed Delaware\u2019s escheat scheme at length in prior opinions, see  Univar v. Geisenberger , 409 \n \n1  Plaintiff originally moved for a temporary restraining order (D.I. 82), but lat er clarified that \nit was seeking both a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.  (D.I. 88).  \n \n2  On June 6, 2022, the Court preliminarily granted the portion of Plaintiff\u2019s request seeking \na temporary restraining order for the reasons stated  in the Court\u2019s O rder.  (D.I. 98).  That \nOrder remains in effect until its stated expiration (Friday, June 10, 2022 at 12:00 a.m .).  \nAfter that time, the State may enforce the Subpoena (because the Court is hereby denying \nPlaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminar y injunction).  2 F. Supp. 3d 273 (D. De l. 2019) and Eaton Corp. v. Geisenberger , 486 F.Supp.3d 770 (D. Del. \n2020).  In light of the expedited nature of the proceedings here, the Court addresses only the limited \naspects of the UPL  that bear most on the pending motion.  \n\u201cAn escheat is a procedure by which \u2018a sovereign may acquire title to abandoned property \nif after a number of years no rightful owner appears.\u2019\u201d  Univar, Inc. v. Geisenberger , 409 F. Supp. \n3d 273, 276 (D. Del. 2019) (quoting Texas v. New Jersey, 379 U.S. 674, 675 (1965)).  The Stat es, \nas sovereigns, have the right to escheat property and, in a line of cases referred to as the Texas \ntrilogy, the Supreme Court delineated priority rules that States must adhere to in escheating \nproperty:  \nFirst, we must determine the precise debtor -credi tor relationship as \ndefined by the law that creates the property at issue.  Second, \nbecause the property interest in any debt belongs to the creditor rather than the debtor, the primary rule gives the first opportunity to escheat to the State of \u201cthe credi tor\u2019s last known address as shown \nby the debtor \u2019s books and records.\u201d   Finally, if the primary rule fails \nbecause the debtor \u2019s records disclose no address for a creditor or \nbecause the creditor \u2019s last known address is in a State whose laws \ndo not provide f or escheat, the secondary rule awards the right to \nescheat to the State in which the debtor is incorporated.  These rules arise from our \u201cauthority and duty to determine for [ourselves] all questions that pertain\u201d to a controversy between States, and no St ate \nmay supersede them by purporting to prescribe a different priority under state law.   \n \nDelaware v. New York, 507 U.S. 490, 499\u2013500 (1993)  (citations omitted) .   \nPursuant to the UPL, on an annual basis, entities domiciled in Delaware are required to \nreport to the State Escheator property in their possession that is presumed abandoned and subject \nto the custody of the State.\n3  12 Del. C. \u00a7 1142.  To ensure compliance with the law, the State is \npermitted  to \u201c[e]xamine  the records of a person or the records in the possession of an agent, \n \n3  Unless otherwise indicated, the Court\u2019s reference to the UPL is to the version in effect at the time of this opinion\u2019s issuance.   3 representative, subsidiary, or affiliate of the person under examination in order to determine \nwhether the person complied with [the law].\u201d  12 Del. C. \u00a7 1171(1).  The UPL specifies that the State Escheator may take custody of property if the holder of the property is domiciled in Delaware \nand \u201cany of the following circumstances are met:  (1) Another state is not entitled to the property \nbecause there is no last -known address in the recor ds of the holder of the owner or other person \nentitled to the property.  (2) The state of the last -known address of the owner or other person \nentitled to the property does not provide for custodial taking of the property.  (3) The last -known \naddress of the  owner is in a foreign country.\u201d  12 Del. C . \u00a7 1141(a) . \nIn the wake of some criticism and judicial rulings , Delaware revised its escheat laws  in \n2017.  One change  imposed, for the first time , a requirement that certain records be retained \u201cfor \n10 years after the date the report was filed.\u201d  12 Del. C. \u00a7 1145.  Absent complete records \u201cthe \nState Escheator may determine the amount of property due using a reasonable method of estimation based on all information available to the State Escheator, including to extrapolation and \nthe use of statistical sampling when appropriate.\u201d  12 Del. C. \u00a7 1176(a).  If the State chooses to \nestimate the amount of property due, 12 Del. Admin. C. \u00a7\u00a7 104- 2.18 et seq . provides a framework \nfor how such estimation is to be conducted.  \nDelaware regulations provide that the most recent amendments  to the UPL , described \nabove, shall be applied to ongoing examinations \u201c[t]o the extent practical .\u201d  12 Del. Admin. C. \n\u00a7 104- 2.3.  The S tate has taken the position in this case that \u201c[t]he 2017 [UPL] applies to ongoing \nexaminations  . . .\u201d, and has noted that prior to the imposition of the 2017 records retention \nrequirement, \u201cUnivar was subject to other common records -retention  requirements .\u201d  (D.I. 89 at \n10).  The State , however,  did not expressly claim that or explain how its records retention policy 4 adopted in 2017 could be (or would be) applied to Univar for records not retained prior to 2017 \nthat had not been subject to a r etention requirement . \nB. Procedural History  \nUnivar is a public corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with a \nprincipal place of business in Illinois.  (D.I. 97 \u00b6 9).  On December 11, 2015, Defendants informed \nUnivar that it was the subject of an unclaimed property audit (\u201cthe Audit\u201d) to be conducted by the State of Delaware\u2019s agent, Kelmar Associates, LLC (\u201cKelmar\u201d).  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 22 , 56-57).  The purpose \nof the Audit was to \u201cdetermine [Univar\u2019s] compliance with Delaware escheat laws,\u201d an d \u201cthe scope \nof the examination [was originally stated to] be for the period 1986 through present.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 56).  \nOn December 22, 2015, in a subsequent letter, the  scope of the examination was corrected to be \nthe period 1991 through present.  ( Id. \u00b6 57).   \nKelmar sent Univar requests for production of document s to which Univar objected.  ( Id. \n\u00b6 22).  As set out more fully in the Court\u2019s September 17, 2019 opinion (D.I. 59), what followed \nwas a protracted back -and-forth where Univar resisted furnishing the S tate with any documents.  \nFinally, on October 30, 2018, Delaware issued the Subpoena to  Univar, pursuant to the amended \nUPL, requesting all information appearing in Kelmar\u2019s initial document request s, including: tax \nreturns; consolidating income statements ; consolidating balance sheets; consolidating cost of \ngoods sold; detailed state apportionment schedules; cash managers, shared services entities, and common paymaster entities; G/L numbers and account numbers; and prior audits or voluntary disclosure agre ements.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7 5-76).   \nRather than complying with the Subpoena, on December 3, 2018, Plaintiff filed the original \nverified Complaint in this case.  ( D.I. 1).  In it, Plaintiff allege d ten counts against Defendants for: \nunreasonable search and seizure (Count I); violation of substantive due process (Count II); 5 violation of procedural due process (Count III); violation of the e x post facto clause (Count IV); \nan unconstitutional t aking (C ount V); a violation of equal protection of the laws (Count VI); \n\u201cinjunction\u201d (Count VII); \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d (Count VIII); violation of federal common law \n(Count IX); and attorneys \u2019 fees (Count X).  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 77 -154).  The Complaint sought : \na declaration that the State of Delaware, through its agent and \nauditor, [Kelmar] has subjected and continues to subject, Univar to an unclaimed property audit (\u201cAudit\u201d) under 12 Del. C. \u00a7 1171 et seq. [sic] that (1) infringes on Univar\u2019 [sic] right under the Fourth \nAme ndment to the United States Constitution to be free from \nunreasonable searches and seizures; (2) deprives Univar of its substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; (3) deprives Univar of its procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; (4) has subjected Univar to an unconstitutional taking of private property for public use without just compensation; and (5) has violated Univar\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws.   \nFour days after Plaintiff filed its C omplaint, the State filed a verified Complaint against \nUnivar in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to compel Univar to comply with the Subpoena.  \n(D.I. 16 at 1).  On April 11, 2019, Vice Chancellor Slights stayed  the Chancery Court action \u201cfor \nthe sake of efficiency and the orderly adjudication of the threshold constitutional issues\u201d by this \nCourt.  (D.I. 22, Ex. B at 45:15- 46:4).  Defendant then  moved to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s fede ral action.  \n(D.I. 14).  Thi s Court dismissed all but  Plaintiff\u2019s equal protection and procedural due process \nclaims as unripe, reasoning that Plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the UPL were premature because it had not been compelled to comply with the Subpoena.   (D.I. 59).  T he Court then stayed the case so \nthat the Chancery Court could determine whether the S ubpoena Delaware sought to enforce was , \nin fact,  enforceable.  On April 7, 2022, Vice Chancellor Slights answered that question in the \naffirmative and  entered the Final State Court Order , setting the date for Plaintiff to comply with \nthe S ubpoena as June 6, 2022.  (D.I. 84, Ex. A  at 2).   6 Plaintiff chose not to appeal  the Final State Court Order to preserve its ability to bring its \nfederal claims in this Court ,4 and moved to lift the stay in this case .  (D.I. 72).  The Court  granted \nPlaintiff\u2019s motion .  (D.I. 80).  Thereafter, Plaintiff filed the instant motion (D.I. 88) and the Court \ngranted Plaintiff leave to file a n Amended Complaint.5  The verified  Amended Complaint (D.I.  97) \nupdates certain factual allegations and alleges : unreasonable search and seizure (Count I); violation \nof substantive due process (Count II); violation of procedural due process (Count III); violation of \nthe ex post facto clause  (Count IV); violation of substantive due process (Count V); violation of \nequal protection (Count VI); unconstitutional taking (Count V II); violation of foreign commerce \nclause (Count VIII); violation of federal common law (preemption) (Count IX); void for vagueness \n(Count X); injunction (Counts XI, XII) and attorneys \u2019 fees (Count X III).  ( D.I. 87).  The Amended \nComplaint seeks  thirteen declarations that the Audit is improper for various reasons as well as an \ninjunction enjoining the Audit and an award of fees.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cPreliminary injunctive relief is \u2018an extraordinary\u2019 remedy\u201d appropriate \u201c \u2018only in limited \ncircumstances. \u2019\u201d  Kos Pharm., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 708 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Am. \nTel. & Tel. Co. v. Winback & Conserve Program, Inc., 42 F.3d 1421, 1427 (3d Cir. 1994)).  \u201cIt \nmay be granted only when the moving party shows \u2018(1) a likelihood of success on the merits; \n \n4  The State argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction because of the Rooker -Feldman doctrine. \n(D.I. 89 at 5- 8).  Plaintiff, however, challenged the enforceability of the Subpoena in the \nCourt of Chancery without raising the claims brought here, i.e., challenge s to the \nlawfulness of various provisions of the UPL .  Plaintiff is not inviting this court to review \nand reject the jud gment of the Chancery Court, and the Rooker -Feldman doctrine does not \napply. \n \n5  The Court granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend in order to update and clarify the state of \nthe current record for this Court as well as any appellate review.  As the Court noted during \nthe June 3, 3022 teleconference, the Court did not address futility  in allowing the \namendment.   (D.I. 99 (Tr.) at 3:2- 3:10).  7 (2) that the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; (3) that granting \npreliminary relief will not result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party; and (4) that the public interest favors such relief.\u2019\u201d  Doe by and through Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 526 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting Kos , 369 F.3d at 708); accord Winter , 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  \nMovants face a \u201cheavy burden,\u201d Lane v. New Jersey, 753 F. App\u2019x. 129, 131 (3d Cir. 2018) (citations omitted), and must establish entitlement to relief by \u201cclear evidence,\u201d Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d at 526.  Fai lure to establish any of the elements, but particularly either of the \nfirst two, renders preliminary injunctive relief \u201cinappropriate.\u201d  Arrowpoint Capital Corp. v. Arrowpoint Asset Mgmt., LLC , 793 F.3d 313, 319 (quoting NutraSweet Co. v. Vit -Mar Enters., \nInc., 176 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir. 1999)). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \nPlaintiff\u2019s motion assert s four grounds  on which preliminary relief should be granted:  \n1) the State\u2019s retroactive application of the UPL violates the United States Constitution\u2019s due \nprocess, ex post facto, and takings clauses (D.I. 83 at 7 -10); 2) the State\u2019s use of estimation and its \nestimation methodology are preempted by federal common law and violate Univar\u2019s constitutional rights ( id. at 10 -14); 3) UPL \u00a7 1141(a)(3) and \u00a7 2.2.2.3 of the regulations violate the f oreign \ncommerce clause, are preempted, violate the t akings clause, and Univar\u2019s due process rights (i d. \nat 14 -15): and 4) the State\u2019s unlawful delegation of authority to a self -interested third party violates \nUnivar\u2019s due process and equal protection rights ( id. at 15 -17).  The Court addresses these issues \nbelow . \n  8 1. Claims Based on Use of \u201c Estimation \u201d \nThe clear focus of the Plaintiff\u2019s briefing  in asking the Court to enjoin enforcement of the \nSubpoena  is that the Audit will necessarily entail use of estimation to calculate payments due.  \nEstimation is addressed throughout the merits arguments and underli es the first two of Plaintiff\u2019s \nfour bases for relief.  First, Plaintiff claims that the 2017 UPL amendments\u2019 retroactivity violates \nits due process rights and amounts to an ex post facto violation and illegal taking (asserted ground \n1) because \u00a7 1145 of t he 2017 UPL requires certain records to be retained for ten years after the \nholder files its annual escheat report and \u00a7 1176(a) provides that if the holder fails to keep records, \n\u201cthe State Escheator may determine the amount of property due using a reasonable method of estimation[.]\u201d (D.I. 83 at 7- 10).  Thus, Plaintiff contends that estimation will necessarily, and \nunlawfully, occur because :  1) the Subpoena requests documents dating back to 2000 (or perhaps \nlonger)\n6; 2) Univar was not required to (and did not) retain documents back to 2000 (or earlier) ; \nand 3) in the absence of documents, the State will determine an y amount owed by estimation.  (See \ne.g., D.I. 83 at 8 (regarding retroactive application, \u201cUnivar will be penalized  (in the form of a \nmandatory unconstitutional estimation formula) for not having re cords  that were not required by \nlaw to be kept\u201d), at 9 (regarding retroactive application, \u201cUnder the amended DUPL and the Regulations, estimates are mandatory when a holder  fails to maintain complete records sufficient \nto prove its unclaimed property liability in a given year in the audit period and there is no exception \nfor Audits that were ongoing at the time the amended DUPL and the Regulations became effect ive.\u201d)).   \n \n6  The Court attempted to ascertain the date ran ge at issue in the S ubpoena during the \nJune 3, 2022 teleconference, but neither party seemed able to clearly articulate it.  9 So too, Plaintiff\u2019s preemption arguments (ground 2) are rooted in estimation.   (D.I. 83 at \n10-14).  Plaintiff argues that the  use of estimation is preempted (and precluded) by federal common \nlaw, which requires the \u201cprecise debtor -creditor relationship\u201d to be  ascertained prior to escheating \nproperty.  See Delaware v. New York, 507 U.S. at  499-500 (1993) .  According to Plaintiff , when \nusing estimation the State simply assigns the amount of unclaimed property as a percentage of \nrevenue \u201cwithout ever identifying an actual debtor -creditor relationship upon which the estimate \ncan be tied for the year or years that the estimate is intended to assess.\u201d  (D.I. 83 at 12).  \nThe concern raised by Plaintiff\u2019s focus on estimation is that Plaintiff has not yet pro duced \na single document in connection with the Audit , Defendant asserts that estimation may not be used \nin the Audit, and no request for payment (let alon e payment based on estimation)  has been made.  \nThus, the Court must first consider whether Plaintiff\u2019s  claims based on estimation are ripe.  \n2. Ripeness of Claims Based on Estimation  \nA federal court may not exercise jurisdiction over a dispute if it is not ripe for review.  See \nThompson v. Borough of Munhall , 44 Fed. App\u2019x. 582, 583 (3d Cir. 2002).  \u201cThe ri peness doctrine \nserves to determine whether a party has brought an action prematurely and counsels abstention \nuntil such time as a dispute is sufficiently concrete to satisfy the constitutional and prudential requirements of the doctrine.\u201d  Khodara Envtl., Inc. v. Blakey, 376 F.3d 187, 196 (3d Cir. 2004) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The purpose of the ripeness doctrine \u201cis to prevent the courts . . . from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, \nand also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u201d  Abbott Labs. v. \nGardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148- 49 (1967), abrogated on other grounds  by Califano v. Sanders , 430 \nU.S. 99 (1977); accord Plains  All Am. Pipeline  L.P. v. Cook , 866 F.3d 534, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) .  10 As such, \u201c[a] claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may \nnot occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\u201d  Texas v. United States , 523 U.S. 296, \n300 (1998); see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (explaining that \nArticle III standing requires a party to \u201chave suffered an injury\u201d that is \u201cactual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.\u201d ) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe ripeness inquiry in declaratory judgment cases like this one is generally guided by \nthree key factors: \u201cthe adversity of the interest of the parties, the  conclusiveness of the judicial \njudgment[,] and the practical  help, or utility, of that judgment.\u201d  Siemens USA Holdings Inc v. \nGeisenberger , 17 F.4th 393, 412- 13 (3d Cir. 2021)  (citations omitted) .  This analysis is sometimes \nreferred to as the Step -Saver  test.  Plains  All Am., 866 F.3d at 540 (citing Step-Saver Data Sys., \nInc. v. Wyse Tech. , 912 F.2d 643, 647 (3d Cir. 1990) ).  When applying the Step-Saver test in the \ncontext of  escheat challenges, the Court must differentiate between challenges to the scope of an \nescheat audit  and challenges to a state\u2019s auditing authority.  Siemens , 17 F.4t h at 413.  Of these, \nthe latter \u201ctype has better odds of being ripe before an audit is complete.\u201d  Id. (citing Marathon \nPetroleum Corp. v. Sec\u2019y of Fin., 876 F.3d 481, 499 (3d Cir. 2017) ).    \nHere,  the Court is convinced that  Plaintiff\u2019s challenge  to the claims based on estimation  is \ndirected to the scope of an audit and application of the  Step-Saver factors  counsels against finding \nthat these claims are ripe.  As an initial matter, Plaintiff does not contest the State\u2019s authority to \n\u201cask for documents to conduct an administrative investigation into [its] compliance with the escheat laws .\u201d  (D.I. 99 ( Tr.) at  4:24\u20135:5, 5:19\u20137:1).   Notwithstanding that, Plaintiff has yet to \nproduce a single document in connection with the Audit and the State has made no demand s for \npayment .  Further, although Plaintiff has represented (and the Court credits) that it does not have 11 complete records dating back to 1991 ( D.I. 97, \u00b6\u00b6  48, 165) ,7 that does not necessarily dictate that \nestimation will be used.  Indeed, it appears that there may be more recent years for which Plaintiff \ndoes have complete records, such that estimation would not come into play under the  UPL .  How \nthe State could properly exercise it s authority to audit those years should the Court enjoin \nenforcement of the Subpoena is unknown.  \nMoreover, the State represents that it is by no means certain that estimation will be used  \neven in the audit of earlier years . (See D.I. 99 ( Tr.) at 21:24\u201322:18).  According to the State, many \naudits (approximately 10%) end after the State asks for foundational documents, which is what the \nState has asked of Plaintiff to date.  (D.I. 99 (Tr.) at  22:23\u201323:8).   Also, according to the State, \neven if Plaintiff tur ns over incomplete documents  for certain periods of time , it may choose not to \nestimate Plaintiff\u2019s liability , but instead to assess compliance based on the records  that currently \nexist.  ( D.I. 99 (Tr.) at  29:2- 13).  A lthough the Court  can speculate that e stimation may indeed be \nused (or abused) in audits  conducted by the State , no record has been made to that effect, and the \nCourt cannot simply discount the State\u2019s representations  at this stage .  Indeed, the UPL does not \nrequire the State to use estimation , providing: \u201c if a person subject to examination . . . does not \nretain records  required . . .  the State Escheator may  determine the amount of property due using a \nreasonable method of estimation . . . \u201d  (emphasis added).  12 Del. C. \u00a7 1176.  The use of the term  \n \n7  It appears that the scope of the A udit may begin in 2000, although the initial inquiry seems \nto be dated back to 1991.  During the June 3, 2022 teleconference , counsel for Plaintiff \nsuggested that complete records are not available for years prior to 2012 (D.I. 99 (Tr.) at \n8:25- 9:3), but no evidence has been offered as to what documents exist other than the \nstatement in the Amended (verified) Complaint that Plaintiff \u201cdoes not maintain records \ngoing back to 1991.\u201d   (D.I. 97, \u00b6  165).  12 \u201cmay\u201d rather than \u201cshall\u201d indicates that the State is permitted to use estimation, not required  to do \nso.8   \nTurning to the Step -Saver test, th e estimation -based claims are focused on the potential for \nthe use of estimation to calculate liability \u2013 an \u201cuncertain and contingent\u201d event  \u2013 such that the \nparties lack sufficient adversity to entertain these claims at th is juncture.9  NE Hub Partners, L.P. \nv. CNG Transmission Corp., 239 F.3d 333, 342 n.9 (3d Cir. 2001) .  Although the expense of an \nadministrative investigation may prove so onerous as to satisfy this factor, that cannot be said here \nwhere the State\u2019s admin istrative investigation is at its infancy and seeking only foundational \ndocuments .  See Plains  All Am. , 866 F.3d at 544.  Last, declining to enjoin the State from enforcing \nthe Subpoena would not cause \u201c[h]ardship  to the parties\u201d because Univar acknowledges that the \nState has the right to conduct an administrative investigation into its compliance with the UPL  and \nthat there is at least some time period in the scope of the Subpoena for which estimation may not \nbe used to assess its liability.  ( See D.I. 99 (Tr.) at 5:2- 5:23, 9:13- 9:25). \n \n8  Plaintiff points to Del. Admin. C. 336, \u00a7 104- 2.18.2.1, which provides that \u201c[i]f the Holder \nfails to retain sufficient dormant years of records, the Audit Manager and Holder shall \ndiscuss which records are to be utilized for the Base Period,\u201d to argue that estimation will \nnecessarily be used.  T he cited  regul ation , however, mandates  how estimation is to be \nconducted when estimation is used .  It does not, however, compel use of estimation.  \n \n9  The Court is mindful of the Third Circuit\u2019s discussion in Siemens , which states in part that \n\u201c[the Third Circuit has] held there is sufficient adversity in an auditing -authority challenge \nwhen a state has actually requested information and the request is itself the claimed harm (i.e., the challenged actions of the state during the audit have alrea dy occurred).\u201d  Siemens,  \n17 F.4th at 498- 99.  Siemens , however, involved very different fact s from those present on \nthe record here.  There, the allegations were, inter alia , that \u201cafter an eleven -year saga,\u201d \nSiemens had \u201cprovided all record s necessary\u201d but  Defendants refused to issue a final \nreport.  In other words, the allegations contested the state\u2019s authority  to conduct any further \naudit proceedings.  Here, the Audit has not really started, Plaintiff has not produced a single \ndocument, and Plaintiff ack nowledges that there may be years during the audit period for \nwhich the State may conduct a legitimate audit (and may not resort to estimation).   13 As the claims based on estimation are not ripe, Plaintiff has failed to show a reasonable \nlikelihood of success on those claims  and the Court will not address the merits of those  claims . \n3. The Foreign Commerce Clause Claims  \nPlaintiff also challenges the fact that Delaware law and regulations permit the State to \nassert jurisdiction and take custody of property owed to an owner with a last known address in a \nforeign country.  See 12 De l. C. \u00a7 1141(a)(3); 104 Del. Admin. C. \u00a7 104- 2.2.2.3.  It contends that \nasserting jurisdiction over the unclaimed property owned by one with a foreign address is preempted by the priority rules promulgated in the Texas trilogy line of cases and also violates the \nforeign commerce clause.\n10  Defendant s, of course, disagree, asserting that escheating such \nproperty \u201cdoes not interfere with foreign commerce\u201d and that it has a legitimate interest in such unclaimed property.   \nThe Court initially notes that Plaintiff has made no showing at all that it, in fact , maintains \ncustody of property owed to an owner with a last known address in a foreign country.  Neither side, however, seems to dispute that  Plaintiff does indeed hold such property or that the State w ill \nseek to escheat it.  Thus, the Court will address the merits of Plaintiff\u2019s claim.  \nFirst, the Court agrees with Defendants that escheating unclaimed property whose last \nknown owner had a foreign address is not preempted by the Texas  trilogy line of cas es. Preemption \nof state law by federal law can be express or implied.  \u2018 \u201cExpress preemption occurs when a federal \nlaw contains express language providing for the preemption of any conflicting state law.\u2019\u201d  New \nJersey Retail Merchants Assoc. v. Sidamon- Eristoff, 669 F.3d 374, 389 (3d Cir. 2012)  (quoting \n \n10  The heading in its opening brief also suggests that Plaintiff contends this violates its due \nprocess rights and amounts to a n illegal taking.  ( See D.I. 83 at 14- 15).  The re is, however, \nno argument or support in the body of its briefs  as to those issues  and, therefore, they are \nnot considered.   14 Kurns v. A.W. Chesterton Inc., 620 F.3d 392, 395- 96 (3d Cir. 2010)).  \u201c\u2018Implied conflict \npreemption occurs . . . where state law stands as an obstacle for the accomplishment and execution \nof the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u2019\u201d, id., or \u201cwhen \u2018compliance with both federal and \nstate regulations is a physical impossibility,\u2019\u201d Brown v. Hotel and Restaurant Em pl. and \nBartenders Int\u2019l Union, 468 U.S. 491, 501 (1984) (citations omitted)).11   \nHere, there is no express preemption.  There is, as Plaintiff recognizes, \u201cno language in the \nTexas  cases giving authority to Delaware to take custody of property owed to ow ners with foreign \nlast known addresses .\u201d  (D.I. 83 at 14) .  There is , however, also no language expressly prohibiting \nDelaware from doing so.  Nor can the Court find that Plaintiff is likely to succeed as to implied \npreemption.  Indeed, Plaintiff makes no argument that the UPL \u201cstands as an obstacle for the \naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress ,\u201d or that \n\u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.\u201d  Thus, there is no record on which the Court could find implied preemption.  \nMoreover, the Court finds that Plaintiff is not likely to succeed on its f oreign commerce \nclause claim.  The f oreign commerce clause provides that \u201cCongress shall have Power . . . To  \nregulate Commerce with foreign Nations .\u201d  U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.  In addressing a state tax, \nthe Supreme Court advised that \u201c[i ]f the state tax \u2018is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus \nwith the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State,\u2019 no impermissible burden on i nterstate \ncommerce will be found.\u201d  Japan Line, Ltd. v. Los Angeles Cnty., 441 U.S. 434, 444- 45 (1979) \n(quoting Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady , 430 U.S. 274, 279  (1977)).  Here, the State appears \n \n11  \u201cIt is undisputed that state law can be preempted by federal common law as well as federal \nstatutes.\u201d  New Jersey Retail , 669 F.3d at 392 (citing Boyle v. United Techs Corp., 487 U.S. \n500, 518 (1988))  15 to be treating unclaimed property owed  to creditors wi th for eign addresses consistent with how it \ntreats unclaimed property belonging to Delawareans or individuals with no last known address .  \nThe State is not discriminating against foreign nationals and the escheated property has a \nsubstantial nexus  to and i s fairly related to  Delaware, as the money to be escheated is currently \nbeing held by entities domiciled in Delaware.  Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that \nPlaintiff is likely to succeed in its  foreign c ommerce c lause claim.  \n4. Plaintiff\u2019s Claims Based on the Use of Kelmar  \n \nFinally, Plaintiff contends that its procedural due process rights are violated because \nKelmar is paid on a contingent -fee basis (D.I. 83 at 16) and \u201cKelmar acts in a quasi -judicial \ncapacity with the authority to make all substantive and procedural decisions about the Audit[.]\u201d  \n(Id.).  Plaintiff also asserts that Kelmar decided to audit Univar because it is a large and profitable \ncompany, and that there is no rational basis for this arbitrary selection criteri a.  (Id. at 16 \u201317).   In \nresponse, Defendants first offer evidence that Kelmar is not paid on a contingent -fee basis.  ( See \nD.I. 91, Ex. A at 5; 12 Del. C. \u00a7 1178).  Further, they assert that the State controls the A udit and \nthat Kelmar merely acts as the State\u2019s agent.  Last, they claim that the selection of Univar for an \naudit rests on the rational standards articulated in 12 Del. Admin C.  \u00a7 104- 2.12.4.   \nThe Court does not find that Plaintiff\u2019s claims are likely to succeed on the merits.  Based \non the record, Plaintiff\u2019s bare assertion that Kelmar is paid on a contingent -fee basis is contradicted \nby evidence offered by the State.  The State\u2019s contract with Kelmar  provides that, except for \nsecurities -related work, Kelmar is be paid on an hourly basis.  (See D.I. 91, Ex. A. at 5).  This is \nconsistent with what the law demands.  See 12 Del. C. \u00a7 1178 (generally providing for paying \ncontracted auditors on an hourly basis ).  Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019s assertion that Kelmar acts with \nunfettered discretion is pres ently unsupported.  The regulations enunciated in 12 Del. 16 Admin  C. \u00a7\u00a7 104 et seq. were devised by the State and \u201care not discretionary, and third- party audit \nfirms may not develop or utilize their own distinct applications of these standards and \ninstructio ns.\u201d  12 Del. Admin C.  \u00a7 104- 2.1.  Thus, although further factual development may prove \nthat Kelmar enjoys unfettered discretion in a manner that offends the Constitution, the  Court is \nunable to conclude that based on the record before it .   \nFurther, the C ourt does not believe that Plaintiff is likely to succeed in its e qual protection \nclaim, because the selection criteria specified in 12 Del. Admin. C. \u00a7  104- 2.12- 4 appears properly \ngeared to ward  scrutinizing entities who may not have complied with the escheat laws  without \nregard for whether they are \u201clarge\u201d or \u201cprofitable.\u201d   See, e.g., 12 Del. Admin C. \u00a7 104- 2.12.4.2 \n(\u201cWhen identifying a Holder to be examined, the State may consider . . . [a] comparison of a \nHolder \u2019s past reports to the reports of similar H olders within the same industry and of the same \napproximate size.\u201d).  \nB. Irreparable Harm  \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must \u201cdemonstrate that irreparable injury is \nlikely in the absence of an injunction.\u201d  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22; accord  Issa v. Sch. Dist. of \nLancaster , 847 F.3d 121, 142 (3d Cir. 2017).  \u201c\u2018The relevant inquiry is whether, at the time the \ninjunctive relief is to be issued, the party seeking the injunction is in danger of suffering irreparable harm.\u2019  The irreparable harm alleged must be actual and imminent, not merely speculative.\u201d  \nShabazz v. Delaware Dep \u2019t of Corr., C.A. No. 16 -570-RGA, 2020 WL 998541, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. \n2, 2020) ( quoting Friends of the Earth  v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 \n(2000) ). \nPlaintiff submits that it will suffer irreparable harm if the State  is not enjoined from \nenforcing the Subpoena and compelling it to comply with the document demands and Audit.  17 Univar asserts that forced compliance will harm it by exposing it to a loss of its constitutional \nrights in addition to escalating penalties and fees assessed upon a finding that it withheld unclaimed \nproperty from the State.  See 12 Del. C. \u00a7 1183 (providing that  \u201c[i]nterest at 0.5% per month on \noutstanding unpaid amounts accrues from the date the amounts or property were due under this chapter until paid.\u201d).  Further, Univar believes that it will be irreparably harmed because of the financial and operational burden associated with complying with the A udit, which will inter fere \nwith the company\u2019s operations for a lengthy period of time.  Plaintiff cautions that these burdens may only increase as there is nothing stopping Kelmar from issuing additional requests.  \nAt this stage, the Court does not find that Plaintiff will face irreparable harm in the absence \nof an injunction.  The only thing that Plaintiff must do now is supply the State with documents in \nfurtherance of an administrative investigation into whether Univar has previously complied with \nthe UPL.  The only burden tha t Plaintiff is certain to endure  is gathering documents and \ntransmitting them to the State.  It has been remarked that \u201c the costs of administrative investigations \nare usually not sufficient, however substantial, to justify review in a case that would otherwise be unripe ,\u201d and though the context is different, the Court believes that the same logic can be extended \nto the irreparable harm analysis based on the circumstances of this case.  Plains All Am. , 866 F.3d \nat 542; see also Acierno v. New Castle Cnt y., 40 F.3d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he injury . . . \nmust be of such a peculiar nature, so that compensation in money alone cannot atone for it.\u201d ) \n(citations omitted ).  Plaintiff is not irreparably harmed by having to comply with an investigation \nthat, at present, seeks nothing more than foundational documents to ensure past compliance with \nescheat laws.  \nOf course, Plaintiff\u2019s concerns of irreparable harm extend beyond merely supplying the \nState with documents.  Univar contends that because it does not possess documents that it was not 18 required to keep, the State will eventually estimate its liability, resulting in an erroneously inflated \nassessment.  As explained above, the Court can at this time only speculate about whether estimation will occur, and a  finding of irreparable harm cannot be predicated on events that are \nmarkedly uncertain.  Cont \u2019l Grp., Inc. v. Amoco Chems. Corp., 614 F.2d 351, 359 (3d Cir. 1980) \n(\u201cThe requisite for injunctive relief has been characterized as a clear showing of immediate  \nirreparable injury or a presently existing actual threat.\u201d) ; ECRI v. McGraw -Hill, Inc. , 809 F.2d \n223, 226 (3d Cir. 1987) (explaining that \u201c [e]stablishing a risk of irreparable harm is not enough\u201d \nto warrant injunctive relief ); Synthes, Inc. v. Gregoris , 228 F. Supp. 3d 421, 440 (E.D. Pa. 2017) \n(\u201cAny irreparable harm must be imminent.\u201d).   \nAlthough the Third Circuit has stated that \u201ccontingency does not prevent a finding of \nirreparable injury\u201d the Court  hesitates to overread th at statement , which was made i n reference to \nNew Jersey Retail Merchants Association v. Sidamon- Eristoff, 669 F.3d 374 (3d Cir. 2012) .  See \nSiemens 17 F.4th at 409 .  In New Jersey Retail , the plaintiff challenged New Jersey\u2019s right to \nescheat certain property despite never being subject to enforcement under the challenged statute.  Despite New Jersey not enforcing the statute  against plaintiffs  at the time of the suit, the plaintiffs \nwere s till irreparably harmed because they faced the prospect of either (1) complying with the \nstatute, resulting in the loss of money it could not later obtain, due to sovereign immunity, if the statute was deemed unconstitutional, or (2) being assessed fines and penalties upon future \nenforcement  for noncompliance.  Id. at 388.  Univar , however, does not find itself in th at situation, \nbecause unlike the New Jersey Retail Merchants plaintiff, it concedes that the State has the right \nto audit it and escheat unclai med property that is not based on estimation.\n12  Moreover, because \n \n12  Plaintiff is perhaps closer to the New Jersey Retail Merchants conundrum with respect to \nits claim th at 12 Del. C. \u00a7 1141(a)(3) is preempted and unconstitutional.  But the present \nrecord  and posture  does not support a finding of irreparable harm because Plaintiff has not 19 the State has not assessed Univar any money, it is not certain that there is currently interest accruing \nor penalties to be levied.  The fact that Univar has yet to be assessed liability al so distinguishes \nthis case from  Siemens , where the plaintiff was irreparably harmed because it ei ther had to pay its \nassessed liability (that, like Univar, it challenged as being the product of unlawful estimation) or interest and penalties for noncompliance with the statute .   \nThus, Univar has failed to establish that it faces irreparable harm in the absence of an \ninjunction prohibiting the State\u2019s enforcement of the Subpoena . \nC. The Remaining Factors  \nThe absence of either a reasonable likelihood of success or of irreparable harm is sufficient \nto deny Plaintiff\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction.  See, e.g., Am. Exp. Travel Related Servs., Inc. v. Sidamon -Eristoff, 669 F.3d 359, 374 (3d Cir. 2012) (declining to analyze the remaining \npreliminary injunction factors because the moving party failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits) ; Ferring Pharms., Inc. v. Watson Pharms., Inc., 765 F.3d 205, 219 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(\u201cAbsent a showing of irreparable harm, a pla intiff is not entitled to injunctive relief, even if the \nother three elements are found ( citing  NutraSweet , 176 F.3d at 153)).  Thus, here, where Plaintiff \nhas failed to establish a reasonable likelihood of success and that it would suffer irreparable harm  \nwithout preliminary injunctive relief, the Court need not reach the remaining two factors.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff\u2019s motion (D.I. 88) for a preliminary injunction \nenjoining Defendants from enforcing the Subpoena that was the su bject of the Final State Court \nOrder  is denied.  An appropriate order will follow. \n \nsubmitted evidence that it has unclaimed property belonging to foreign nationals, and also \nbecause it is not seeking to enjoin the State from enforcing the statute in the future.
