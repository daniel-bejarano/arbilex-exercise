Andrews", "date": "02-16-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nW. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION , \nPlaintiff; Civil Action No. 20-1122-RGA \nV. \nJONATHAN R. BECKER, \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is Defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (D.I. 15). I have \nconsidered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 16, 18, 19). For the following reasons, Defendant 's \nmotion is DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff (\"Berkley\") sued Defendant (\"Mr. Becker\") for breach of contract. (D.I. 1). \nThe contracts at issue arose during Mr. Becker's employment at Berkley's subsidiary , Acadia. \n(D.I. 1 ,r,r 3-16, 21-23). Starting in 2007, Mr. Becker and Berkley entered into a series of \nrestricted stock unit (\"RSU\") agreements , which granted Mr. Becker stock as part of an incentive \nplan. (See D.I. 1, Exs. 1-8). The agreements have repayment provisions allowing Berkley to \ndemand repayment should Mr. Becker engage in \"Competitive Action\" within a year of leaving \nAcadia. (D.I. 1 ,r 17). Berkley claims that Mr. Becker has engaged in competitive action and \n1 brings this suit to demand repayment. The agreements have Delaware choice of law provisions \nwhich state, \"This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of \nthe State of Delaware , without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.\" (D.I. 1 Ex. 1 \n\u00a7 18; Ex. 2 \u00a718; Ex. 3 \u00a7 19; Ex. 4 \u00a7 19; Ex. 5 \u00a7 19; Ex. 6 \u00a7 19; Ex. 7 \u00a7 19). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6), the Court must accept the complaint's factual allegations as true. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not \nhave to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, conclusions, or a \"formulaic \nrecitation \" of the claim elements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint \nare true (even if doubtful in fact).\"). There must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially \nplausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility \nstandard is satisfied when the complaint 's factual content \"allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. (\"Where a \ncomplaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the \nline between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" ( cleaned up)). \nIII. DISCUSSI ON \nMr. Becker argues that I should dismiss this case for two reasons. First, the repayment \nprovisions in the RSU Agreements are void ab initio under a Maine law that prohibits repayment \nof compensation . (D.I. 16 at 2 (citing 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 629)). Second, even if the provisions are \n2 not void ab initio, Maine law controls (and renders the repayment provisions illegal) under a \nchoice-of-la w analysis. (Id.). \nEach of Mr. Becker's arguments is premised on the assumption that the RSU Agreements \nviolate 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 629. I say \"assumption \" because the opening brief does not lay out why \nthe RSU Agreements violate 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 629. The statute provides: \nA person, firm or corporation may not require or permit any person as a condition of \nsecuring or retaining employment to work without monetary compensation or when \nhaving an agreement , oral, written or implied, that a part of such compensation should be \nreturned to the person, firm or corporation[ .] \nMr. Becker argues: \n\u00a7 629 expressly prohibits \"unfair agreements \" that require an employee to return any \nportion of his or her compensation to their employer . In other words, any agreement that \nrequires an employee to return a part of his or her compensation except for a few narrow \nexceptions listed therein, constitutes an \"unfair agreement \" and is therefore , illegal. \nGiven this prohibition , the RSU Agreements ' repayment provision was void ab initio, \nmeaning it was illegal under Maine law at its inception when sent to Mr. Becker in Maine \nas a Maine employee. \n(D.I. 16 at 6). This analysis does not establish a violation. It fails to, for instance, establish that \nBerkley, as a corporate parent of Mr. Becker's employer, would be covered by the statute or that \nthe RSU Agreements provide \"compensation \" under the statute. Mr. Becker's reply comes \ncloser. (D.I. 19 at 3-4 (arguing that\u00a7 629 is not limited to employers and that parent companies \nare \"commonl y considered 'employers' for purposes of wage and hour laws\")). \nThere are two problems with Mr. Becker's first argument , that the contract is void ab \ninitio. One, Mr. Becker has not shown by his argument that the repayment provision is void ab \ninitio under Maine law. Two, even if he had so shown, there would be the issue that the contract \nsays it is controlled by Delaware law. The argument that Maine law should be applied to the \ncontract independently and prior to consideration of the impact of the choice of laws selection \n3 clause does not make much sense. If Delaware law applies, why would it not apply to all \nprovisions of the contract? \nI move on to Mr. Becker's second argument that Maine law applies under a choice-of\u00ad\nlaw analysis. \n\"In a diversity action, the court must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state to \ndetermine what substantive law will govern.\" Huber v. Taylor, 469 F.3d 67, 73 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(quotation omitted). In Delaware, the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws governs. Focus \nFin. Partners, LLC v. Holsopple, 241 A.3d 784, 803 (Del. Ch. 2020). For contracts, \"The law of \nthe state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied\" \nunless: \n(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and \nthere is no other reasonable basis for the parties' choice, or \n(b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy \nof a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination \nof the particular issue and which, under the rule of\u00a7 188, would be the state of the \napplicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties. \nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187 ( 1971 ). Delaware has also enacted 6 Del. C. \u00a7 \n2708, which states: \n(a) The parties to any contract, agreement or other undertaking ... may agree in writing \nthat the contract, agreement or other undertaking shall be governed by or construed under \nthe laws of this State, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, or that the laws of \nthis State shall govern .... The foregoing shall conclusively be presumed to be a \nsignificant , material and reasonable relationship with this State and shall be enforced \nwhether or not there are other relationships with this State. \nBerkley asserts that this Delaware statute ends the inquiry. (D .I. 18 at 6-8). The \nDelaware Court of Chancery has found, \"Section 2708 essentially stipulates that for purposes of \ndeciding whether to apply a Delaware choice of law provision , courts may assume a negative \nanswer to both of [the Restatement (Second)] exceptions.\" FdG Logistics , LLC v. A&R Logistics \nHoldings, Inc., 131 A.3d 842, 854-55 (Del. Ch.), aff'd sub nom. A & R Logistics Holdings , Inc. \n4 v. FdG Logistics LLC, 148 A.3d 1171 (Del. 2016). The disputed contracts agreed that Delaware \nlaw applies \"without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.\" Thus, I may assume \nthat neither exception applies. \nBerkley may be right that the Delaware statute resolves the issue, but courts considering a \nDelaware choice of law provision tend to analyze each exception even when the parties have \nsuch a choice oflaw provision. E.g., WR. Berkley Corp. v. Dunai, 2021 WL 1751347 at *1 (D. \nDel. May 4, 2021 ). I will therefore consider the Section 187 exceptions. \nAt the first exception, I find that Berkley has a substantial relationship with Delaware \nbecause Berkley is incorporated in Delaware. Focus Fin. Partners, 241 A.3d at 804; 6 Del. C. \u00a7 \n2708. \nAt the second exception, I must consider whether Maine has a \"materially greater \ninterest\" than Delaware and, if so, \"whether applying Delaware law would be contrary to a \nfundamental policy\" in Maine. Coface Collections N Am. Inc. v. Newton, 430 F. App'x 162, 168 \n(3d Cir. 2011 ).1 I preliminarily find that Delaware law would not be contrary to a fundamental \npolicy in Maine. I therefore will not address whether Maine has a \"materially greater interest\" \nthan Delaware. \nIt is often premature to conduct a choice of law analysis at the motion to dismiss stage. \nSee Graboffv. The Collern Firm, 2010 WL 4456923 at *8 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 8, 2010) (\"Due to the \ncomplexity of this analysis, when confronted with a choice of law issue at the motion to dismiss \nstage, courts within the Third Circuit have concluded that it is more appropriate to address the \n1 I am assuming without deciding that Maine's law would \"be the state of the applicable law in \nthe absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.\" Restatement (Second) of Conflict of \nLaws\u00a7 187(2)(b). \n5 issue at a later stage in the proceedings.\"). In this case, however, a Maine court has already \nfound that applying Delaware law would not be contrary to a fundamental policy of Maine. \nIn a first-filed suit in Maine, Mr. Becker sued Berkley. (D.I. 18-1, Ex. A at 1). Berkley \nmoved to dismiss based on the Delaware forum selection clause in the RSU Agreements. (Id. at \n4). Mr. Becker argued that the forum selection clause, in combination with the Delaware choice \nof law clause, would deprive Mr. Becker of his rights under 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 629. 2 The Maine \ncourt disagreed, explaining: \nAfter examining the relevant statutory provisions pursuant to Maine and Delaware law, \nthe Court declines to hold unenforceable the choice of law provision on the ground that \nthe application of Delaware law to Mr. Becker's claims violates a fundamental policy of \nMaine. Delaware's employment statu[t]es address withholding and timing of wage \npayments , as does 26 M.R.S. \u00a7 629, the statute that is the basis of Mr. Becker's claim. \nCompare 26 M.R.S. \u00a7 629 with Del. Code Ann. Tit. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 1102, 1107 (addressing timing \nof wage payments and restricting employers from \"withhold[ing] or divert[ing] any \nportion of an employee's wages\"). Both statutes are \"designed to protect\" employees \n\"from being forced to work without pay.\" Cooper v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 635 \nA.2d 952, 955 (Me. 1993). The application of this public policy in Delaware is not \nsignificantly different from its application in Maine. Because Mr. Becker has failed to \nshow significant differences in the application of the relevant public policy, he has failed \nto show that enforcement of the choice of law provision would violate a fundamental \npolicy in Maine. \n(Id. at 6). At this juncture, it seems likely that a choice of law analysis based on a more thorough \nrecord would yield the same result. A Maine judge is good authority on Maine's fundamental \npolicy, especially when analyzing the same contract under the same law. \nFurthermore, other judges have applied Delaware law to the exact same repayment \nprovisions after a choice-of-law analysis. See Dunai, 2021 WL 1751347 at* 1 (considering \n2 Berkley argues that Mr. Becker should be collaterally estopped from arguing that the RSU \nAgreements violate Maine public policy. (D.I. 18 at 10). Most of Berkley's argument is in a \nfootnote. (Id. at 10 n.3). \"[A]rguments raised in passing (such as, in a footnote) , but not \nsquarely argued, are considered waived.\" John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Int'! Corp., 119 \nF.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 1997). Thus, I reject Berkley's collateral estoppel argument. \n6 Illinois law); WR. Berkley Corporation v. Niemela, 2019 WL 5457689 at *2-4 (D. Del. Oct. 24, \n2019) ( considering California law). Thus, I think it likely that Delaware law applies. \nSince Mr. Becker has made no argument for why I should dismiss the suit under \nDelaware law, this ends the inquiry. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nMr. Becker's motion to dismiss (D.I. 15) is DENIED . \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 16th day of February , 2022. \n7 "}
