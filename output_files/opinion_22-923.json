Civil Action No. 22-0923-GBW \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiffs1 brought this civil rights action on behalf of a putative class of prisoner patients \nin the care and custody of the Delaware Department of Corrections (\"DDOC\"). D.I. 1. In their \nComplaint, filed on July 12, 2022, Plairitiffs assert that Defendant Centurian of Delaware , LLC \n(\"Centurian\") was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs ' health and safety when Centurian \nimplemented and enforced a Pain Management Initiative policy in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \nSee D.I. 1 at ,r,r 383-92. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants Sheri L. McAfee-Gamer, Dr. \nEmilia Adah , Flora A. Atangcho , Barbara Denkins, William F. Ngwa, and Feeah M. Stewart \n(collectively, \"Individual Centurian Defendants \") were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs ' \n1 The Complaint names Jenail Brown, Jeremy Cartwright, Jeffrey Clayton, William Cordell, Bryan \nCordrey, Philip Davis, Sean Dupree, James Elliotte, Frankie Galindez, Ronald Grine, Christopher \nKing, Japhis Lampkins , George Leifheit, John Mayhew, James Mccardell, Jeffery Mccray, Gary \nPalmer, Richard Pandiscio , Stephen Parsons, John Taylor, Joseph Walls, Adam Wenzke, Frank \nWhalen Jr., and Robert Worley as Plaintiffs . See D.I. 1. Plaintiffs claim to have identified at least \n106 individuals who suffered injury because of the Pain Management Initiative policy, see id. at ,r \n372, and seek to certify a class of putative inmates who were \"similarly affected by the Defendants ' \nallegedly wrongful conduct as complained of herein.\" Id. at ,r 376. \n1 medical needs based on the Pain Management Initiative policy, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \nSee id at 11393-97 .

For the reasons below, the Court grants-in-part and denies\u00ad\nin-part Centurian and Individual Centurian Defendants ' Motion. \nI. BACKG ROUND3 \nThis suit is brought by twenty-four inmates in custody of DDOC who suffer medical \nconditions that cause chronic pain (\"Plaintiffs \"). D.I. 1 at 1196-369 . Plaintiffs ' medical conditions \nvary, but Plaintiffs all allege that their chronic pain was treated with long-term prescriptions of \nopioids or opioid alternatives (such as Gabapentin and Pregabalin) until Plaintiffs were tapered off \ntheir opioid medications pursuant to a policy implemented and enforced by Defendants known as \nthe \"Pain Management Initiative. \" Id at 11 58-72. The Pain Management Initiative policy was \npurportedl y implemented in late 2019 by the DDOC, Correct RX Pharmacy Services, Inc. (CRX\"), \nand Connections Community Support Programs (\"Connections \")4, and was alleged to have been \nreimplemented and enforced by Centurian when it took over from Connections as DDOC's inmate \nhealthcare vendor in April 2020.

Id. at ,r,r 393-97. \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). \nSuch a claim must plausibly suggest \"facts sufficient to 'draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"' Doe v. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th 335, 342 (3d \nCir. 2022) ( quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)) ( citing Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544,557 (2007)). \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\"' Klotz v. Celentano Stadtmauer & Walentowicz LLP, 991 F.3d 458,462 (3d Cir. 2021) \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). But the Court will \"'disregard legal conclusions and recitals of \nthe elements of a cause of action supported by mere conclusory statements.\"' Princeton Univ., 30 \nF.4th at 342 (quoting Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. 2016)). \n\"'The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' Pinnavaia v.

Apr. 6, 2018). Rule 12(b)(6) \nrequires the court to accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the \nlight most favorable to plaintiff. AbbVie Inc, 976 F.3d at 351. The court may consider matters of \npublic record and documents attached to, \"integral to[,] or explicitly relied upon in\" the complaint. \nSchmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014) (cleaned up); see also Spizzirri v. Zyla Life \nScis., 802 F. App'x 738, 739 (3d Cir. 2020) (same). \"A motion to dismiss 'may be granted only \nif, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light \n3 most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\"' McCrone v. Acme Markets, 561 F. \nApp'x 169, 172 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Burlington Coat Factory, 114 F.3d at 1420). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs bring constitutional claims for deliberate indifference to serious medical need \nagainst Defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See generally D.I. 1. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is not \nitself a source of substantive rights but is rather a vehicle that plaintiffs may use against state actors \nto redress for alleged violations of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution or other \nfederal law, including under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. City of Oklahoma City v. \nTuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 816 (1985); see also Kneipp v. Tedder, 95 F.3d 1199, 1204 (3d Cir. 1996). \nA. \u00a7 1983 Claims against Defendant Centurian \nPlaintiffs seek relief, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for Centurian 's alleged deliberate \nindifference to the health of Plaintiffs by implementing and enforcing the purported \nunconstitutional \"Pain Management Initiative\" policy. See D.I. 1 at ,r,r 383-392. Centurian moves \nto dismiss this claim, arguing that it cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983 because the Complaint alleges \nthat the DDOC and Connections promulgated the unconstitutional \"Pain Management Initiative\" \npolicy, not Centurian. D.I. 30 at 8-11. \n\"On its face, \u00a7 1983 makes liable 'every person' who deprives another of civil rights under \ncolor of state law.\" Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 497 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part). In Monell v. Departm ent of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), the Supreme \nCourt of the United States established that municipalities and other local governmental units are \nincluded among those \"persons\" subject to liability under \u00a7 1983. Id. at 690. This theory of \u00a7 \n1983 liability for constitutional violations based on a municipal entity's policies and customs has \nbeen extended to apply to private companies providing prison medical services under contract. \nSee Natale v. Camden Cty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 584 (3d Cir. 2003) (applying Monell to a \n4 private company providing medical services to inmates); Francis v. Carroll, 659 F. Supp. 2d 619, \n625-26 (D. Del. 2009) (\"[A]lthough a private corporation offering medical services cannot be held \nliable for an alleged\u00a7 1983 violation under a theory of respondeat superior, it can be held liable \nfor a policy or custom that demonstrates deliberate indifference .\") (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n\"Under Monell, a municipality [or corporation] cannot be subjected to liability solely \nbecause injuries were inflicted by its agents or employees.\" Jiminez v. All American Rathskeller, \nInc., 503 F.3d 247, 249 (3d Cir. 2007). Rather, a municipality or corporation can be liable under \n\u00a7 1983 only i'f the conduct alleged to be unconstitutional either \"implements or executes a policy \nstatement, ordinance , regulation , or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body's \nofficers\" or is \"visited pursuant to governmental 'custom' even though such a custom has not \nreceived formal approval through the body's official decision-making channels. \" Monell, 436 U.S. \nat 690-91. \"[I]t is when execution of a government 's policy or custom, whether made by its \nlawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts \nthe injury that the government as an entity is responsible under\u00a7 1983.\" Jiminez, 503 F.3d at 249. \n\"A plaintiff must identify the challenged policy, attribute it to the [municipality or corporation] \nitself, and show a causal link between execution of the policy and the injury suffered.\" Losch v. \nBorough of Parkesburg , 736 F.2d 903,910 (3d Cir. 1984). Plaintiffs asserting an unconstitutional \npolicy claim \"must point to an official proclamation , policy or edict by a decisionmaker possessing \nfinal authority to establish municipal policy on the relevant subject.\" Forrest v. Parry, 930 F.3d \n93, 105 (3d Cir. 2019). To support an unconstitutional custom claim, Plaintiffs ' allegations \"must \nevince a given course of conduct so well-settled and permanent as to virtually constitute law.\" Id. \nat 106. \n5 Here, at this early stage of litigation, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim, \npursuant to \u00a7 1983, against Centurian for its alleged deliberate indifference to the health of \nPlaintiffs by implementing and enforcing the purported unconstitutional \"Pain Management \nInitiative\" policy. The crux of Centurian 's argument is that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the \nPain Management Initiative was a policy promulgated by Centurian. D.I. 30 at 10. Rather, other \nentities, including Connections, CRX, DDOC, and the Bureau of Healthcare, Substance Abuse, \nand Mental Health Services, implemented the Pain Management Policy in late-2019. D.I. 1 at ,i,i \n63, 383. However, Plaintiffs ' Complaint alleges that \"[a]fter April of 2020, Defendant Centurian \ntook over the contract for medical services delivery within DDOC from Connections .\" Id. at ,i 73. \nIn doing so, DDOC \"delegated responsibility for providing constitutionally adequate health care \nto prisoners in DDOC custody to Centurian .\" Id. at ,i 16. Further, Plaintiffs allege that Centurian \npersonnel were on a board that annually reviews all DDOC policies, id. at ,i 33, and that Centurian \nis responsible for \"assing[ing] each facility a Health Services Administrator ('HSA') who is \nsupposed to 'develop site-specific procedures ' for the assigned facility and 'carry out DDOC \npolicies,\"' id. at ,i 34. Moreover , Plaintiffs aver that \"DDOC, Centurian , and CRX, are jointly \ntasked with developing , reviewing , editing and finalizing new versions of policies and procedures \nrelative to patient health and healthcare , including verifying that all site-specific procedures \ncomply with all current NCCHC and ACA standards as well as federal law.\" Id. at ,i 41. As to \nthe specific Pain Management Initiative policy, Plaintiffs allege that, when Centurian took over in \nApril 2020, Centurian did not reassess the Pain Management Initiative nor abate its \nimplementation , but rather adopted and continued to implement the policy. Id. at ,i,i 73-74. \nTaking all factual allegations as true, Plaintiffs have adequately pled facts sufficient to state \na claim, pursuant to\u00a7 1983, against Centurian . Based solely on allegations in the Complaint , the \n6 Court can draw the reasonable inference that, when Centurian was deemed responsible for \nproviding healthcare to DDOC inmates beginning in April 2020, it effectively adopted and \nenforced the Pain Management Initiative as its own policy. That is, Centurian was 'jointly tasked \nwith developing, reviewing, editing and finalizing new versions of policies and procedures relative \nto patient health and healthcare,\" and adopted and continued to implement and enforce the Pain \nManagement Initiative policy as its own. Id. at ,r 41, 73-74. That Centurian was not an original \nauthor of the Pain Management Initiative policy does not alter this analysis because Plaintiffs have \nalleged sufficient facts at this juncture such that the Court can reasonably infer that the alleged \nunconstitutional policy can be attributed to Centurian.5 See Losch, 736 F.2d at 910. \nAccordingly, because Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to state a claim, pursuant to \u00a7 \n1983, against Centurian, the Court will deny Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 \nclaim against Defendant Centurian (Count I). \nB. \u00a7 1983 Claims against Individual Centurian Defendants \nPrison officials violate an inmate's Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and \nunusual punishment when they are deliberately indifferent to an inmate's serious medical needs. \nSee Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro , 834 F.2d 326,346 (3d Cir. 1987) (describing \ntwo-part standard established in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976)). To plead such a claim, a \nplaintiff must allege that (1) the medical need is \"serious,\" meaning it is \"one that has been \ndiagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one that is so obvious that a lay person would \n5 Centurian attaches as \"Exhibit A\" to its Motion to Dismiss, the DDOC's \"Responsible Health \nAuthority\" policy, and argues that this demonstrates that the DDOC, not contractors such as \nCenturian, are responsible for healthcare policy of inmates. See D.I. 30 at 10. Even if the Court \nwere to consider \"Exhibit A\" as a matter of public record, \"Exhibit A\" was clearly implemented \nin January 2022. See D.I. 30, Ex. A. As such, it bears no relevance to the Court's analysis of\u00a7 \n1983 claims accruing between 2019 and 2020. \n7 easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention, \" and (2) prison officials were deliberately \nindifferent to that need. Id. at 347 (quoting Pace v. Fauver, 479 F. Supp. 456,458 (D.N.J. 1979), \naffd, 649 F.2d 860 (3d Cir. 1981)). While \"mere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment \n[does not] support a claim of an [E]ighth [A]mendment violation, \" a prison official is deliberately \nindifferent if he delays necessary medical treatment for nonmedical reasons, has \"knowledge of \nthe need for medical care ... and engages in an intentional refusal to provide that care,\" or \n\"prevent[s] an inmate from receiving recommended treatment for serious medical needs.\" Id. at \n346-47 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Abu-Jamal v. Kerestes, 779 Fed. App'x 893, 900 \n(3d Cir. 2019). \nFor purposes of this motion, accepting as true Plaintiffs' allegations that they suffered a \nsignificant amount of pain, see generally D.l. 1 at ,r,r 96-369, and noting that Defendants do not \ndispute otherwise, the Court finds it is plausible there was a 'serious medical need.\" Thus, the \ncrux of the dispute is whether Plaintiffs adequately plead facts sufficient to allege that the \nIndividual Centurian Defendants were \"deliberate indifferent\" to Plaintiffs' serious medical needs \nbased on the Pain Management Initiative policy. Based solely on allegations in the Complaint , the \nCourt cannot reasonably infer that the Individual Centurian Defendants were \"deliberately \nindifferent\" to the serious medical needs of Plaintiffs. \nEven drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, the allegations reflect that \nIndividual Centurian Defendants were continually providing Plaintiffs with medical attention and \nexercising their professional medical judgment in connection with the Pain Management Initiative \npolicy. See Brown v. Borough of Chambersburg , 903 F.2d 274, 278 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"[I]t is well \nestablished that as long as [the medical professional] exercises professional judgment [their] \nbehavior will not violate a prisoner's constitutional rights.\"). For example, with respect to many \n8 of the Plaintiffs' serious medical needs, the Individual Centurian Defendants explained their \nconcerns with habit-forming medication such as Tramadol and, exercising their professional \njudgment, ordered the Plaintiffs to be tapered off that medication. See D.I. 101 at ,r,r 102, 131, \n153,181,274. The allegations also demonstrate that, following the implementation of the Pain \nManagement Initiative, Individual Centurian Defendants exercised professional judgment in \nadvising Plaintiffs that Gabapentin was not indicated for their specific chronic pain and, thus, \nPlaintiffs' use of that medication would be discontinued. Id. at ,r,r 129, 151, 165, 183, 218, 239, \n280. Similarly, Plaintiffs acknowledged that, following the implementation of the Pain \nManagement Initiative, Individual Centurian Defendants provided alternative over-the-counter \npain medications , such as Tylenol, Motrin, and naproxen, and other alternative pain remedies, \nincluding exercise therapy and breathing techniques. Id. at ,r,r 71, 112, 123, 137, 168, 219, 245, \n281, 332. These allegations do not indicate that the Individual Centurian Defendants ignored \nPlaintiffs' serious medical conditions and chronic pain, but rather demonstrate that the Individual \nCenturian Defendants provided continuing healthcare , reassessments , and alternative pain \nremedies. See United States ex rel. Walker v. Fayette Cnty., 599 F.2d 573,575 n.2 (3d Cir. 1979) \n(\"Where a prisoner has received some medical attention and the dispute is over the adequacy of \nthe treatment, federal courts are generally reluctant to second guess medical judgments and to \nconstitutionalize claims which sound in state tort law.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). That \nPlaintiffs disagreed with the Individual Centurian Defendants ' methods of treatment , or found \nIndividual Centurian Defendants ' care inadequate or improper, does not support an Eighth \nAmendment claim. See Norris v. Frame, 585 F .2d 1183, 1186 (3d Cir. 1978); McCray v. Williams, \n357 F. Supp. 2d 774, 781 (D. Del. 2005). \n9 More so, Plaintiffs' allegations also demonstrate that, in accordance with providing . \ncontinuing healthcare, reassessments, and alternative pain remedies, Individual Centurian \nDefendant reassessed Plaintiffs and re-prescribed various opioid-medications when the Individual \nCenturian Defendant determined, within their professional judgment, that it was an appropriate \ntreatment for Plaintiffs' pain relief. D .I. 1 at ,r 71. Some Plaintiffs were even assessed by outside\u00ad\nmedical specialists who recommended that Plaintiffs be re-prescribed certain opioid-medications , \nwhich Individual Centurian Defendants then provided. Id. at ,r,r 134-38, 261,276. Based on these \nallegations , it seems that extensive , albeit ineffective, measures were taken to address Plaintiffs' \nmedical needs . Thus, based solely on Plaintiffs ' Complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences \nin favor of Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts to state a \u00a7 1983 claim against the \nIndividual Centurian Defendants . \nAccordingly , because Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim, \npursuant to\u00a7 1983, against the Individual Centurian Defendants, the Court will grant Defendants ' \nMotion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claim against the Individual Centurian Defendants. \nC. Statute of Limitations \nAlternatively, Defendants urge the Court to dismiss twenty-three named Plaintiffs from \nthis case because their\u00a7 1983 claims are purportedly barred by Delaware's two-year statute of \nlimitations. D.I. 30 at 17-18. Plaintiffs disagree, arguing that its\u00a7 1983 claims were equitably \ntolled while Plaintiffs exhausted their administrati ve remedies pursuant to the Prison Litigation \nReform Act (\"PLRA\"). D.I. 54 at 18. Alternatively , even if the statute of limitations were not \ntolled during Plaintiffs' administrative exhaustion , Plaintiffs contend that their\u00a7 1983 claims are \nsubject to the continuous violation doctrine. Id. at 19. The statute oflimitations in a \u00a7 1983 action is governed by the limitations period applicable \nto personal injury actions of the state where the cause of action arose. Kach v. Hose, 589 F.3d \n626, 634 (3d Cir. 2009). The Delaware statute of limitations for a personal injury action is two \nyears. See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119; St. Louis v. Haller, 215 F. Supp. 3d 307, 312 (D. Del. 2016) (\"In \nDelaware, \u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two-year limitations period.\"). \"Section 1983 claims \naccrue 'when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which [his] action is \nbased.\"' St. Louis, 215 F. Supp. 3d at 312 (quoting Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia, 142 \nF.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998)). Contrary to Defendants ' position, see D.I. 60 at 9, this District has \nconsistently held that the statute of limitations in an action brought by a prisoner under \u00a7 1983 is \ntolled during the time the inmate exhausts his administrative remedies. See, e.g., Lucas v. Carney, \nNo. 21-469-LPS, 2022 WL 2116959 (D. Del. June 13, 2022); Passwaters v. Garner, No. 22-955-\nMN, 2022 WL 17669178 (D. Del. Dec. 14, 2022); McCormickv . Dematteis, No. 21-1315-VAC, \n2022 WL 1462809 (D. Del. May 9, 2022). \ni. All Plaintiffs Except for Plaintiff Galindez6 \nHere, it is not apparent on the face of Plaintiffs ' Complaint whether the Plaintiffs pursued \nand exhausted their respective administrative remedies under the PLRA. As such, the Court cannot \nreasonably determine the amount of time that passed while Plaintiffs exhausted those \nadministrative remedies. Without knowing how long the limitations period was tolled, the Court \ncannot determine whether the statute of limitations had expired prior to Plaintiffs filing of this \naction. Because the Court cannot determine whether Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims are time-barred \nbased on the allegations in the Complaint, the Court cannot dismiss those claims. See Thomas v. \n6 For this section only, i.e., Section III.C.i, the Court refers to all named Plaintiffs, except for \nPlaintiff Galindez, collectively as \"Plaintiffs.\" \n11 Brinich, 579 F. App'x 60, 62 (3d Cir. 2014); cf Paluch v. Sec'y, Dep 't of Corr., 442 F. App'x 690, \n694 (3d Cir. 2011). Accordingly , Defendants ' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims as time \nbarred is denied with respect to all Plaintiffs ' \u00a7 1983 claims, except for Plaintiff Galindez. See \ninfra Section III.C.ii. \nii. Plaintiff Galindez \nThe Complaint alleges that Plaintiff Galindez was released from custody before filing this \naction, see D.I. 1 at ,i 209, meaning the requirement to exhaust his administrative remedies \npursuant to the PLRA does not apply. See Defreitas v. Montgomery Cty. Corr. Facility, 525 F. \nApp'x 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2013) (\"[A] plaintiffs status as a prisoner for purposes of the PLRA is \njudged as of the time he files his original complaint. \"). Plaintiff Galindez alleges that, as a result \nof the Pain Management Initiative policy, Defendants tapered him off of Gabapentin for a period \nof thirty days following a December 2019 medical evaluation. Id. at ,i 205. Based on these \nallegations , the Court can reasonabl y infer that Plaintiff Galindez knew or should have known of \nhis injury stemming from the Pain Management Initiative policy, at the latest, by the end of January \n2020, i.e., approximately thirty days following a December 2019 examination. See Delaware State \nCollege v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 256-259 (1980) (a claim accrues when injurious action is taken \nand communicated , not when the \"effects\" of this action are experienced at a later point); Chardon \nv. Fernq.ndez , 454 U.S. 6, 7-8 (1981) (extending Ricks to Section 1983 claims); see also D.I. 1 at \n,i 206 (\"In January 2020, Mr. Galindez requested Gabapentin to manage his nerve and back pain.\"). \nThus, to fall within the prescribed statutory period, Plaintiff Galindez must have filed his action \nno later than the end of January 2022. However , this action was filed on July 12, 2022. See D.I. \n1. Thus, Plaintiff Galindez 's \u00a7 1983 claim is time-barred by Delaware's two-year statute of \nlimitations. \n12 Plaintiffs attempt to salvage any claims barred by Delaware 's two-year statute of \nlimitations, arguing that Plaintiff Galindez 's claim is \"subject to the continuous violation \ndoctrine.\" D .I. 54 at 19. \"The continuing violations doctrine is an equitable exception to the timely \nfiling requirement. \" Cowell v. Palmer Township, 263 F.3d 286,292 (3d Cir. 2001). This doctrine \nprovides that \"when a defendant 's conduct is part of a continuing practice, an action is timely so \nlong as the last act evidencing the continuing practice falls within the limitations period; in such \nan instance, the court will grant relief for the earlier related acts that would otherwise be time \nbarred.\" Barrett v. McDonald, 2015 WL 5679732, at *6-7 (D. Del. Sep. 25, 2015) (quoting \nBrenner v. Loe. 514, United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am., 927 F.2d 1283, 1295 (3d Cir. \n1991)). The purpose of the continuous violations doctrine is to address continuing acts, \"not \ncontinual ill effects from an original violation. \" Cowell, 263 F.3d at 293 (quoting Ocean Acres \nLtd. v. Dare County Bd. Of Health, 707 F.2d 103, 106 (4th Cir. 1983). \nHere, the continuous violations doctrine will apply to Plaintiff Galindez' s \u00a7 1983 claim if \nthe Complaint alleges that the last act evidencing the continuing practice occurred on or before \nJuly 12, 2020. However, the Complaint alleges that the \"last act\" Defendants took, with respect \nto Plaintiff Galindez pursuant to the Pain Management Initiative , was arguably in January 2020 \nwhen Defendants declined to re-prescribe Gabapentin and instead offered Plaintiff Galindez a \nprescription for Elavil. D.I. 1 at ,r 206. The remaining allegations related to Plaintiff Galindez do \n-not plead any instances or actions occurring after January 2020 where Defendants discontinued \nopioid-medications or failed to offer effective alternative remedies pursuant to the Pain \nManagement Initiative policy. Thus, because this action was filed on July 12, 2022, the continuous \nviolations doctrine is inapplicable to Plaintiff Galindez 's \u00a7 1983 claim. Accordingly , Plaintiff \nGalindez 's \u00a7 1983 claim is time-barred and, therefore , dismissed with prejudice. \n13 D. Plaintiffs' Request for Leave to Amend \nPlaintiffs also request leave to amend its Complaint \"if the Court finds the current pleadings \ninsufficient. \" D.I. 54 at 27-28. The Third Circuit abides by the liberal policy of allowing \namendments to pleadings where there is no indication of bad faith, undue delay, prejudice, or \nfutility. Alston v. Parker, 363 F. 3d 229, 235-36 (3d Cir. 2004). Here, Plaintiffs may be able to \ncure the deficiency of its pleadings with respect to their \u00a7 1983 claim against the Individual \nCenturian Defendants. Coupled with the fact that this is Plaintiffs' first request to amend its \nComplaint, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' request to amend its Complaint. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nTherefore , at Wilmington this 8th day of March, 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nDefendants Centurian and Individual Centurian Defendants ' Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 29) is \nDENIED with respect to Count I against Defendant Centurian and GRANTED with respect to \nCount II against the Individual Centurian Defendants . Count II against Individual Centurian \nDefendants is dismissed without prejudice , and Plaintiffs' request to amend its Complaint is \nGRANTED with respect to Count II against the Individual Centurian Defendants. Finally, \nbecause Plaintiff Galindez's claims are time-barred by Delaware 's statute of limitations , IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs Galindez's claims are dismissed with prejudice. \n14 GREGORY B.
