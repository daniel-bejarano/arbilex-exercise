No. 19-2108-LPS \nTROOP 2 STATE POLICE, et al., \nDefendants. \nAnthony D. Dreher, Howard R. Young Correctional Institution, Wilmington, Delaware . Pro Se \nPlaintiff. \nJune 13, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION f~P-~ \nSTARK, U.S. Circuit Judge: \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Anthony D. Dreher (''Plaintiff\" ), an inmate at the Howard R. Young Correctional \nInstitution in Wilmington, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.1 (D.I. 2) \nPlaintiff appears prose and has been granted leave to proceed in joT771a paupen's. (D.I. 8) The Court \nproceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a). \nII. BACKGROUND \nNamed Defendants are Troop 2 State Police (Troop 2\") and Governor's Task Force (\"Task \nForce''). Plaintiff alleges that on January 31, 2018, he was in a parked car eating Chinese food when \ntwo members of the Task Force told him to \"freeze.\" They punched and choked Plaintiff and \npulled him out of the car through the driver's side window. Plaintiff alleges that one of the officers \ncontinued beating him. Three other Troop 2 officers pulled up and joined the Task Force officers \nin beating Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that he was beaten until he passed out and, when awakened in a \nK-9 unit patrol car, the K-9 unit officer pulled him from the car and beat him some more. \nPlaintiff was hospitalized and treated for two fractured ribs, a slight concussion, bruises, and \nlacerations to the face. He was charged with resisting arrest, a charge he alleges was later dropped. \nPlaintiff alleges violations of the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution . The Complaint does not contain a prayer for relief. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim \n1 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a \nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See \nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n1 upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from \nsuch relief.\" Ball v. Famig/io, 726 F.3d 448,452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (informa \npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant ); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions ). The \nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to a prose plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds prose, his pleading is liberally \nconstrued and his Complaint, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards \nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nAn action is frivolous if it ''lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\" Neitzke v. \nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319,325 (1989). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(l), a court \nmay dismiss a complaint as frivolous if it is \"based on an indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \n\"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or delusional\" factual scenario. Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28; see also \nWilson v. Rackmifl, 878 F.2d 772, 774 (3d Cir. 1989); Deutsch v. United States, 67 F.3d 1080, 1091-92 (3d \nCir. 1995) (holding frivolous a suit alleging that prison officials took inmate's pen and refused to \ngive it back). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(l) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule \n12(6)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(6)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted \npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a \nplaintiff leave to amend his Complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grcryson \nv. Mcryview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \n2 A complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bel/AtL Co-rp. v. Twomb!J, 550 \nU.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations \" are not required, a complaint must do \nmore than simply provide \"labels and conclusions \" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.\" Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Cata!Jsts ILC, 7 65 F .3d 306, \n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twomb!J, 550 U.S. at 570). \nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility . See \nJohnson v. Ciry of Shelf?y, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect \nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nUnder the pleading regime established by Twomb!J and Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency \nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a \nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume \ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See \nConnel!J v. Lane Const. Co-rp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task \nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nTo state a viable\u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege facts showing a deprivation of a \nconstitutional right, privilege, or immunity by a person acting under color of state law. See Daniels v. \n3 Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 330 (1986). Dismissal is proper because neither defendant is a person for \npurposes of\u00a7 1983. See Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989); Calhoun v. Young, \n288 F. App'x 47 (3d Cir. 2008). \nIn addition, the Complaint does not contain a prayer for relief. Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 8(a)(2) and (3) requires that a complaint contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and \"a demand for the relief \nsought,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(3). See e.g., Scibelli v. Lebanon Cry., 219 F. App'x 221,222 (3d Cir. 2007); \nsee also Klein v. Pike Cry. Comm'rs, 2011_ WL 6097734 (M.D. Pa. Dec. 6, 2011) (failure to articulate \nprayer for relief compels dismissal ). Plaintiff's failure to specify relief of any sort of relief, coupled \nwith naming improper defendants, compels dismissal. See Liggon-&dding v. Souser, 352 F. App'x 618, \n619 (3d Cir. 2009) (affirming dismissal without prejudice where complaint failed to identify relief \nsought). \nAccordingly, the Complaint will be dismissed. However , since it appears plausible that \nPlaintiff may be able to articulate a claim against individual defendants, he will be given an \nopportunity to amend his pleading. See O'Dell v. United States Gov't, 256 F. App'x 444 (3d Cir. 2007) \n(leave to amend is proper where plaintiff's claims do not appear \"patently meritless and beyond all \nhope of redemption ''). \nV. CONCL USION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss the Complaint for failure to state claims \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b)(1); \n(2) dismiss both Defendants ; and (3) give Plaintiff leave to amend. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nANTHONY D. DREHER, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civ. No. 19-2108-LPS \nTROOP 2 STA TE POLICE, et al., \nDefendants. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 13th day of June, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion \nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED for failure to state claims upon which relief may be \ngranted pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b)(1). \n2. Defendants are DISMISSED as the claims against them are not cognizable. \n3. Plaintiffs request for a hearing (D.I. 10) is DENIED as moot. \n4. Plaintiff is given leave to file an amended complaint on or before July 15, 2022. \nPlaintiff is placed on notice that the case will be dismissed without prejudice should Plaintiff fail to \ntimely file an amended complaint. \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT "}
