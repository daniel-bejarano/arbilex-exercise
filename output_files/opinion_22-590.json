D.I.\n70. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Zynga's Motion.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe '904 patent is entitled \"Organization for Promotion Management.\" Promotions are\n\"specific marketing communications that are typically provided in a marketing campaign.\" D.I.\n27-1, Ex. C at 2:53-54. The '904 patent describes \"[a] computer implemented method for\nproducing a promotion list for a promotion management campaign .... The method includes\nassigning one or more promotion instances to the promotions list, and storing the promotion list in\nan electronic medium.\" Id. at Abstract. Prior to the '904 patent:\n[Mjarketers used a top-down system in order to create and distribute promotions .\n... Marketers would create a small number of standardized promotions and query\na database for potential customers with particular attributes to find a group of\ntargets who would receive the promotions. Marketers could modify basicinformation by completing fields in the standardized promotions, much like\ncompleting a form when going to the doctor's office. In this one-way process of\ndistributing promotions, information was only received fi-om the consumers after\nthe promotions were already sent .... [M]arketers could use \"mail merge\"\nfimctionality to insert the customer's name, email, physical address, and other\ncharacteristics into preset fields on preexisting promotions. Using the mail merge\ntechnique, marketers could create the impression of personalized advertising\u2014^as\nlong as the number of promotions remained manageable.\nD.I. 27 It 55, 56.\nIBM states there were several challenges with this one-way process of distributing promotions:\nFirst, existing software systems could only create static promotions, limiting\nmarketers to similar promotions, which were then sent to large groups of target\nconsumers. Marketers were imable to dynamically tailor advertisements for\nindividual consumers and instead had to focus on finding the widest appeal for a\nsingle advertisement. This approach was rudimentary and inefficient, because each\npromotion was both time consuming to create and dubiously relevant to the\nconsumer. Second, existing software systems were static and could not generate\nvaluable analytics for improving current marketing campaigns. Prior art software\ncould modify subsequent marketing campaigns. But it did not allow for dynamic\nmodification of current promotions based on individual preferences or attributes.\nMarketers could only determine the general success of a marketing campaign after\nthe campaign had already ended. Third, existing software systems could not\neffectively create, select, organize, and distribute tailored promotions to a wide\nvariety of consumers. Online advertising dramatically increased the number of\npotential consumers and promotions, which prior art systems were ill-equipped to\nhandle. The prior art top-down system could either: (I) send more targeted\npromotions to smaller groups; or (2) send less targeted promotions to large groups.\nBoth options encountered efficiency and efficacy issues, respectively.\nD.I. 40 at 2 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original); see also D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at 1:6-I9.\nAccording to IBM, the '904 patent overcomes these challenges. It \"improve[s] how\npromotions were generated and how they were subsequently managed, organized, and distributed.\"\nD.I. 27153. \"[T]he '904 patent employ[s] data science techniques in computer software whereby\ndynamically adjustable promotion templates and promotion instances are used to generate,\ndistribute, and track digital promotions with the help of robust data mining and analytics, thereby\nincreasing the effectiveness of a promotion campaign.\" Id.Promotions are created by using a \"promotion template\" with fields (known as \"attributes\")\nto create different versions of the promotion (known as \"promotion instances\"). D.I. 27-1, Ex. C\nat 3:65-4:21. The '904 patent also allows marketers to search a database of existing promotion\ninstances and assign certain promotions to a \"promotion list.\" Id. at 16:17-20; see also Fig. 17.\n\"Marketers could [] manipulate the promotion instances in the promotion list as a unit.\" D.I. 30 at\n2 (citing D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at 16:18-20).\nClaim 1 of the '904 patent recites:\nA computer implemented method comprising:\nproducing, by one or more computers, a promotion list for a promotion\nmanagement campaign by:\ngenerating, by one or more computers, a promotion instance fi-om a\npromotion template;\nreceiving, by one or more computers executing marketing campaign\nsoftware, a search query that includes one or more attributes of a\npromotion instance;\nsearching one or more data repositories for promotion instances\nhaving attributes corresponding to the attributes specified in the\nsearch query;\nreturning a list including one or more promotion instances having the\nattributes corresponding to the attributes specified in the search\nquery;\nreceiving, by the one or more computers, a selection of one or more\npromotion instances, fi\"om the returned list, to be included in the\npromotion list;\nassigning the selected promotion instances to the promotions list; and\nstoring the promotion list in an electronic medium.\nD.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claim 1.n. LEGAL STANDARD\na. Motion to Dismiss\nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief...Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).\nSuch a claim must plausibly suggest \"facts sufficient to 'draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.'\" Doe v. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th 335, 342 (3d\nCir. 2022) (quoting v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,678 (2009)) (citing BellAtl Corp. v. Twombly,\n550 U.S. 544,557 (2007)). \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads factual content\nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged.'\" Klotz v. Celentano Stadtmauer & Walentowicz LLP, 991 F.3d 458,462 (3d Cir. 2021)\n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). But the Court will '\"disregard legal conclusions and recitals of\nthe elements of a cause of action supported by mere conclusory statements.'\" Princeton Univ., 30\nF.4th at 342 (quoting Davis v. Wells Forgo, 824 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. 2016)). Under Rule\n12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all factual allegations in the Complaint and view those facts\nin the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Fed. Trade Comm 'n v. AbbVie Inc, 976 F.3d 327,\n351 (3d Cir. 2020).\nb. Patent Eligible Subject Matter\nPatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is a threshold legal issue. BilsM v. Kappos, 561 U.S.\n593,602 (2010). Section 101 inquiry is properly raised at the pleading stage if it is apparent from\nthe face of the patent that the asserted claims are not directed to eligible subject matter. Cleveland\nClinic Found, v. True Health Diagnostics LLC, 859F.3d 1352,1360 (Fed. Cir. 2017), cert, denied,\n138 S. Ct. 2621 (2018); see also SAP Am., Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC, 898 F.3d 1161,1166 (Fed. Cir.\n2018) (stating that patent eligibility \"may be, and frequently has been, resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6)or (c) motion\"); FairWarning IP, LLC v. latric Inc., 839 F.3d 1089, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2016)\n(stating that \"it is possible and proper to determine patent eligibility imder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 on a\nRule 12(b)(6) motion\" (quoting Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial L.L.C., 818 F.3d 1369, 1373-74\n(Fed. Cir. 2016))); Voter Verified, Inc. v. Election Sys. & Software LLC, 887 F.3d 1376,1379 (Fed.\nCir. 2018) (affirming Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based on \u00a7 101 patent ineligibility). This is,\nhowever, appropriate \"only when there are no factual allegations that, taken as true, prevent\nresolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.\" Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades\nSoftware, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121,1128 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\nSection 101 of the Patent Act defines patent-eligible subject matter. It states, \"[wjhoever\ninvents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,\nor any new and usefial improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions\nand requirements of this title.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Supreme Court has held that there are\nexceptions to \u00a7 101. \"Laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.\"\nAlice Corp. Pty. v. CLSBanklnt'l, 573 U.S. 208,216 (2014) (intemal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). \"[I]n applying the \u00a7 101 exception, [the court] must distinguish between patents that\nclaim the 'building blocks' of human ingenuity and those that integrate the building blocks into\nsomething moreQ thereby 'transforming' them into a patent-eligible invention. The former 'would\nrisk disproportionately tying up the use of the underlying' ideas, and are therefore ineligible for\npatent protection. The latter pose no comparable risk of pre-emption, and therefore remain eligible\nfor the monopoly granted under our patent laws.\" Id. at 217 (cleaned up).\nThe Supreme Court's Alice decision established a two-step framework for determining\npatent-eligibility under \u00a7 101. In the first step, the court must determine whether the claims at\nissue are directed to a patent ineligible concept. Id. In other words, are the claims directed to alaw of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea? Id. If the answer to the question is \"no,\"\nthen the patent is not invalid for teaching ineligible subject matter under \u00a7 101. If the answer to\nthe question is \"yes,\" then the court proceeds to step two, where it considers \"the elements of each\nclaim both individually and as an ordered combination\" to determine if there is an \"inventive\nconcept\u2014i.e., an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in\npractice amoimts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.\" Id. at\n217-18 (alteration in original). \"A claim that recites an abstract idea must include 'additional\nfeatures' to ensure that the [claim] is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the\n[abstract idea].\" Id. at 221 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, \"the\nprohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use\nof [the idea] to a particular technological environment.\" Id. at 222 (quoting Bilski, 561 U.S. at\n610-11). Thus, \"the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible\nabstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\" Id. at 223.\nm. DISCUSSION\na. Claim Construction\nIBM argues, in part, that the \"Court should defer deciding patent eligibility until summary\njudgment, after claim construction and expert discovery.\" D.I. 40 at 1. In the alternative, IBM\nidentifies six claim terms it contends need construction. Id. at 6-7. IBM proposes the following\nconstructions:\n\u2022 \"promotion template\": an object with customizable attribute fields that the\nuser can choose so as to produce other promotion templates, promotion\ninstances, or promotion versions. (See '904 patent at Figs. 3-9; 2:13-14,\n3:66-4:8,4:24-26,4:18-20,7:9-11, 6:54-58,7:16-20.)\n\u2022 \"promotion instance\": a specific marking [5/c] communication generated\nfrom promotion templates using parameterized standard attributes and/orstatic attributes. (See id. at Figs. 8-9,14; 2:51-54, 2:61-3:1, 4:24-26, 5:40-\n50,6:54-58.)\n\"attributes\": information specifying properties of a promotion instance,\nsuch as a name of a promotion instance, a description for a promotion\ninstance, and an expiration date of a promotion instance. (See id. at Figs. 6,\n11-12,16,19,21A-21B; 3:66-4:8,4:45- 6:39,6:54-58,7:16-27.)\n\"at runtime\": during the promotion management campaign. (See id. at Figs.\n10,14; 8:26-30,12:14-15,12:22-27,14:40-51.)\n\"promotion list\": a collection of one or more promotion instances. (See id.\nat Figs. 16-19; 16:16-65,17:40-51.)\n\"promotion management campaign\": the execution of assigning promotion\ninstances to entities that are intended recipients for specific marketing\ncommunications. (See id. at Figs. 1-3,20,21A-21C; 3:8-18,3:34-42, 3:55-\n65, 5:31-38,6:24-29, 9:45-48,12:6- 10,12:24-27,17:31-39.)\nId.\nZynga responds that IBM's proposed constructions do not change its \u00a7 101 analysis. D.I.\n47 at 4-7.1\nThe \u00a7 101 eligibility inquiry is for the court to decide as a matter of law. See Bilski, 561\nU.S. at 602. \"At the pleading stage, to the extent the \u00a7 101 question of law is informed by\nsubsidiary factual issues, those facts are to be construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff.\"\nTwo-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast Cable Comma 'ns, LLC, No. 14-1006-RGA, 2016 WL 4373698,\nat *3 (D. Del. Aug. 15,2016), aff'd, 874 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (citations omitted). There is\nno bright-line rule that a court must construe terms in the asserted patent before it performs a \u00a7\n101 analysis. Bancorp Servs., L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada (U.S.), 687 F.3d 1266,\n1273-74 (Fed.Cir.2012) (\"[W]e perceive no flaw in the notion that claim construction is not an\ninviolable prerequisite to a validity determination under [Section] 101.\")\n^ In its reply brief, Zynga states that it \"accepts IBM's constructions for the purposes of this\n12(b)(6) motion,\" but \"it reserves the right to advance altemative constructions in the future and\ndoes not concede that IBM's constructions are correct.\" D.I. 47 at 7 n.4 (citation omitted); see\nalso D.I. 70 at 6:15-19.\"If there are claim construction disputes at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, [the Federal Circuit]\nha[s] held that either the [trial] court must proceed by adopting the non-moving party's\nconstructions ... or the [trial] court must resolve the disputes to whatever extent is needed to\nconduct the \u00a7 101 analysis, which may well be less than a full, formal claim construction.\" Aatrix\nSoftware, 882 F.3d at 1125 (citations omitted). When assessing Rule 12(b)(6) motions seeking\ndismissal on \u00a7 101 groimds and where the patentee proposes constructions for claims in the\nasserted patent, courts have adopted the patentee's proposed constructions for the purposes of the\nmotion. UbiComm, LLC v. Zappos IP, 7nc., No. 13\u20141029-RGA, 2013 WL 6019203, at *3 n.2, *6\n(D. Del. Nov. 13,2013) (\"As the Court must, the Court reads the claim in the light most favorable\nto the Plaintiff. Here, as the Plaintiff has submitted its proposed claim constructions, there is no\nneed for the Court to independently construe the claim terms.

Lab. Corp. of Am., No. 12-1736-LPS-CJB, 2014 WL 4379587, at '\u2022'6 (D.\nDel. Sept. 3,2014) (citing cases).\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court adopts IBM's proposed constructions for purposes\nof this Motion.b. Patent Eligible Subject Matter\ni. Alice Step 1\nThe Court must first determine whether claim 1 of the '904 patent is directed to an abstract\nidea.^ For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that the '904 patent is directed to the abstract\nidea of manipulating and organizing data.\nIBM argues that \"[t]he '904 patent claims are patent-eligible \\m6et Alice step one because\nthey are directed toward a technological improvement instead of an abstract idea.\" D.I. 40 at 7.\nSpecifically, \"the data structures (promotion templates, promotion instances, and promotion lists)\nimprove the way a computer generates and distributes tailored promotions in campaign\nmanagement software,\" which \"is a patentable 'improvement to computer functionality itself.'\"\nD.I. 40 at 7 (emphasis in original and citations omitted). IBM contends Enfish is the most\nanalogous case to the facts in this case. D.I. 70 at 15:25-16:1; see also D.I. 40 at 7.\nThe Court disagrees and finds Enfish distinguishable. The claims at issue in Enfish recited\na novel data structure\u2014a self-referential table that was \"a specific type of data structure designed\nto improve the way a computer stores and retrieves data in memory.\" Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft\nCorp., 822 F.3d 1327,1339 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The court in Enfish held, \"the claims are not simply\ndirected to any form of storing tabular data, but instead are specifically directed to a self-referential\ntable for a computer database. For [the claim at issue], this is reflected in step three of the 'means\nfor configuring' algorithm ....\" Id. at 1337. The novel data structure in Enfish was required by\nthe claims. In contrast, the claim language in the '904 patent, even adopting IBM's proposed\n^ The Court finds claim 1 of the '904 patent representative. Section III.c of the Memorandum\nOpinion explains the Court's reasoning.constructions, are not directed to a specific data structure that improves the way a computer\ngenerates and distributes tailored promotions.\nSection 101 eligibihty must be assessed on what the patent claims recite. See Alice, 573\nU. S. at 218 (\"We must first determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible\nconcept\") (emphasis added); Ericsson Inc. v. TCL Commc 'n. Tech. Holdings Ltd., 955 F.3d 1317,\n1325 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\"We have altematively described this inquiry as looking at the focus of the\nclaims.\") (intemal quotations omitted and emphasis added); ChargePoint, Inc. v. SemaConnect\nInc., 920 F.3d 759,766 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"But while the specification may help illuminate the true\nfocus of a claim, when analyzing patent eligibility, reliance on the specification must always yield\nto the claim language in identifying that focus.\") (emphasis added). IBM alleges the claim terms\npromotion templates, promotion instances, and promotion lists recite data structures that are\ndirected to improve computer functionality. D.I. 40 at 7. IBM construes the term \"promotion\ntemplate\" to mean \"an object with customizable attribute fields that the user can choose so as to\nproduce other promotion templates, promotion instances, or promotion versions.\" Id. at 6. The\n\"customizable attribute fields\" that the user chooses are the defining feature of all templates and\nall templates serve as a starting point to create other documents. See also D.I. 70 at 6:23-25\n(\"IBM's construction mirrors the defining features of any template using customized fields to\ncreate other documents.\"). IBM's proposed construction of \"promotion template\" does not limit\nthe claims to a particular kind of data structure or technological improvement. ^ This Court and\n^ IBM construes \"attributes\" to mean \"information specifying properties of a promotion instance,\nsuch as a name of a promotion instance, a description for a promotion instance, and an expiration\ndate of a promotion instance.\" D.I. 40 at 6. IBM's proposed construction for \"attributes\" does not\nlimit the claims to a specific kind of data structure or technological improvement. IBM's\nconstruction merely encompasses the abstract idea of filling information into a template.\n10\"[o]ther courts have held that patents directed to using templates to collect or generate documents,\nsuch as web pages, are abstract ideas.\" Hyper Search, LLC v. Facebook /nc.. No. 17-1387-CFC-\nSRF, 2018 WL 6617143, at *6 (D. Del. Dec. 17,2018) (citations omitted).\nIBM construes the claim term \"promotion instance\" to mean \"a specific marking [5zc]\ncommunication generated from promotion templates using parameterized standard attributes\nand/or static attributes.\" D.I. 40 at 6. IBM's proposed construction is broad enough to include a\npromotion instance that uses dynamic and static attributes, but also promotion instances that just\nuse static attributes. Promotion instances that use static attributes provide no technological\nimprovements over the prior art. In fact, IBM appears to concede this point:\nIn the prior art, marketers used a top-down system in order to create and distribute\npromotions .... Marketers would create a small number of standardized\npromotions and query a database for potential customers with particular attributes\nto find a group of targets who would receive the promotions. Marketers could\nmodify basic information by completing fields in the standardized promotions,\nmuch like completing a form when going to the doctor's office. In this one-way\nprocess of distributing promotions, information was only received from the\nconsumers after the promotions were already sent.\nD.I. 27 If 55; see also D.I. 70 at 35:19-20.\nIBM's proposed construction of \"promotion instance\" is simply another way to describe a\ncompleted or filled-out template. IBM's proposed construction also fails to explain how the\ninvention improves the way a computer generates and distributes tailored promotions. IBM\nconstrues \"promotion list\" to mean \"a collection of one or more promotion instances.\" D.I. 40 at\n7. This construction does not impart any structural or technological limits to the claim, and it is\nnot directed to a new technologically improved data structure.\nFinally, IBM construes \"promotion management campaign\" to mean \"the execution of\nassigning promotion instances to entities that are intended recipients for specific marketing\n11communications.\" Id.'^ IBM's proposed construction merely states that the invention can assign\nthe promotion instances to a target audience. As noted by Zynga, \"[t]his adds nothing, as any\npromotion list (including one that is a single static promotion) can be assigned to intended\nrecipients.\" D.l. 47 at 6 (emphasis in original). In sum, none of IBM's proposed constructions\nchange the Court's conclusion that claim 1 of the '904 patent is directed to the abstract idea of\norganizing and manipulating data. The Court disagrees with IBM that its proposed constructions\nrecite data structures that improve the way a computer generates and distributes tailored\npromotions.\nThe Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit have provided some guideposts as to what\nconstitutes an \"abstract idea.\" For example, claims that recite \"'method[s] of organizing human\nactivity' are not patent-eligible because they are abstract ideas.\" Smarlflash LLC v. Apple Inc.,\n680 F. App'x 977, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting Alice, 573 U.S. 208 at 220). Claims that are\n'\"directed to an improvement to computer functionality'\" are not abstract, while claims \"'simply\nadding conventional computer components to well-known business practices'\" are abstract. In re\nTLI Commc 'ns LLC Patent Litig., 823 F.3d607,612 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting Enfish, 822 F.3 d at\n1335). In deciding questions of patent eligibility, and, specifically, in navigating the parameters\nof an abstract idea, it is proper for courts to compare the claims at issue to those previously\nanalyzed in other judicial decisions. See, e.g., Elec. Power Grp., LLC v. Alstom S.A., 830 F.3d\n1350, 1351-54 (Fed. Cir. 2016); see also Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1334 (allowing courts to \"compare\nclaims at issue to those claims already found to be directed to an abstract idea in previous cases\").\n\" The Court discusses IBM's proposed construction of \"runtime,\" which is found in dependent\nclaim 2, in Section lll.c of the Memorandum Opinion.\n12The Court finds that claim 1 of the '904 patent recites three steps: (1) a generating step,\ni.e., filling in template fields in a new promotion; (2) a filtering step, i.e., filtering a database of\npromotions based upon the user's search query; and (3) an assigning and storing step, i.e.,\nassigning the selected promotions to a list and saving that list. D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claim 1; D.I. 27\nII70-72; D.I. 30 at 5-6. The claims of the '904 patent fail under Alice step one, because they are\ndirected to the abstract idea of manipulating and organizing data, which falls into \"a familiar class\nof claims 'directed to' a patent-ineligible concept.\" Elec. Power Grp., 830 F.3d at 1353 (finding\nthe asserted patent ineligible because it was directed to \"collecting information, analyzing it, and\ndisplaying certain results of the collection and analysis.\"); see also Content Extraction &\nTransmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, 776 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding the\nasserted claims were directed to \"the abstract idea of 1) collecting data, 2) recognizing certain data\nwithin the collected data set, and 3) storing that recognized data in a memory\" and were not patent\neligible.); Univ. ofFla. Research Found., Inc. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 916 F.3d 1363, 1367-68 (Fed.\nCir. 2019) (holding claims were not patent eligible because they were directed to collecting,\nmanipulating, and displaying data).\nThe Court finds Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Financial Corp. to be\nparticularly instructive. 850 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2017). The patent at issue \"describes presenting\nthe user with a second document\u2014^the 'dynamic document'\u2014^which is based upon data extracted\nfrom the original XML document. .. [T]he user can then make changes to the data displayed in\nthe dynamic docmnent and the changes will be dynamically propagated back into the original\nXML document (despite the acknowledged compatibility problems with such documents).\" Id. at\n1339. The Federal Circuit held the claims were not patent eligible because the \"claimed invention\n13[wa]s directed to the abstract concept of collecting, displaying, and manipulating data of particular\ndocuments.\" Id. at 1341-42.\nThe '904 patent is similarly directed to the abstract idea of (1) manipulating data, i.e.,\ngenerating promotions from a template; (2) organizing data, i.e., searching a database based upon\na user's search query; and (3) storing data, i.e., saving selected promotions in a list. See D.I. 27-\n1, Ex. C at claim 1. \"The concept of data collection, recognition, and storage is undisputedly well-\nknown.\" Content Extraction, 776 F.3d at 1347.\nCourt have also held patents providing targeted advertising are directed to an abstract idea.\nSee, e.g.. Free Stream Media Corp. v. Alphonsp Inc., 996 F.3d 1355, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2021);\nIntellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Bank (USA), 792 F.3d 1363, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2015);\nBridge & Post, Inc. v. Verizon Commc'ns, Inc., 778 F. App'x 882, 886 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Claim 1\ndescribes a promotion management software that provides tailored promotions to a target audience.\n\"The concept of gathering information about one's intended market and attempting to customize\nthe information then provided is as old as the saying, 'know your audience.'\" OpenTV, Inc. v.\nNetflixinc., 16 F.Supp.3d 886, 893 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 16,2014).\nClaim 1 also merely recites vague, fimctional steps\u2014like ''''generating ... a promotion\ninstance from a promotion template,\" \"searching one or more data repositories. ..,\" \"returning a\nlist...,\" \"receiving. .. a selection of one or more promotion instances...,\" \"assigning the selected\npromotion instances to the promotions list,\" and \"storing the promotion list in an electronic\nmedium.\" D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claim 1 (emphases added). Claim 1, in light of IBM's proposed\nconstructions, does not disclose any \"particular way of programming or designing the [promotion\nmanagement campaign] software\" or \"how this would be technologically implemented.\" See\nApple, Inc. V. Ameranth, Inc., 842 F.3d 1229,1241,1244 (Fed. Cir. 2016). These vague, functional\n14steps in claim 1 are abstract because they are \"devoid of technical explanation as to how to\nimplement the invention.\" See In re TLI Commc 'ns LLC Patent Litig., 823 F.3d at 615. The claims\nalso recite generic computer components, like \"one or more computers\" and \"one or more data\nrepositories.\" See, e.g., D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claim 1. Notably, nothing in the specification suggests\nthat the promotion management campaign \"itself is improved from a technical perspective, or that\nit would operate differentially than it otherwise could.\" See ChargePoint, 920 F.3d at 768. These\nare merely '\"generalized steps to be performed on a computer using conventional computer\nactivity'\" and therefore an abstract idea. See VideoShare, LLC v. Google, Inc., No 13-990-GMS,\n2016 WL 4137524, at *4 (D. Del. Aug. 2,2016) (citation omitted).\nZynga also argues that \"[cjourts have likewise found individual aspects of the asserted\nclaims\u2014^like using a template and filtering a database through search\u2014^to be directed to abstract\nideas.\" D.I. 30 at 8. For example, courts have held patents directed to filling out templates were\ndirected to an abstract idea. See, e.g., CyberFone Sys., LLC v. LexmarkInt'I, Inc., 137 F. Supp.3d\n648,659 (D. Del. Oct. 8,2015) (finding asserted claims directed to \"entering and processing data\nin response to questions on forms or templates\" to be an abstract idea); Tele-Publishing Inc. v.\nFacebook, Inc., 252 F. Supp.3d 17, 23 (D. Mass. May 11, 2017) (claims directed to the creation\nof a personal page for a user that set out steps to \"collect and store personal information\" were\nfound to be abstract). Claim 1 explicitly states that the promotion management software uses\npromotion templates to generate the promotions. See D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claim 1 (\"producing ...\na promotion list for a promotion management campaign by: generating ... a promotion instance\nfrom a promotion template. ..) (emphasis added).\nCourts have also found claims relating to filtering data are directed to an abstract idea. See,\ne.g.. Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Erielndem. Co., 850F.3d 1315,1327 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (asserted\n15claims were \"drawn to the abstract idea of 'creating an index and using that index to search for\nand retrieve data.'\"); BASCOMGlob. Internet Servs. v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 827 F.3d 1341,1348\n(Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding that \"filtering content is an abstract idea because it is a longstanding,\nwell-known method of organizing human behavior, similar to concepts previously foimd to be\nabstract); Blackbird Tech LLC v. Advanced Discovery Inc.,lAo. 16-413-GMS, 2017 WL 2734725,\nat *4 (D. Del. June 26, 2017) (finding the asserted claims \"drawn to the steps of 1) conducting a\nsearch based on a search query, 2) determining a concept associated with a search query, 3) and\nthen ranking the search results based on which documents are most relevant to that concept\"\nabstract). Claim 1 similarly recites generic filtering steps. See, e.g., D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claim 1\n(\"receiving. . . a search query that includes one or more attributes of a promotion instance,\"\n\"searching one or more data repositories for promotion instances having attributes corresponding\nto the attributes specified in the search query,\" \"returning a list including one or more promotion\ninstances having the attributes corresponding to the attributes specified in the search query,\" and\n\"receiving. .. a selection of one or more promotion instances, fi*om the returned list, to be included\nin the promotion list.\"). The Federal Circuit has held \"[ajdding one abstract idea ... to another\nabstract idea... does not render the claim non-abstract.\" RecogniCorp, LLC v. Nintendo Co., 855\nF.3d 1322, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Thus, claim 1 merely recites two abstract ideas\u2014^using a\ntemplate and filtering a database through a search. These two abstract ideas combined do not\nrender claim 1 non-abstract.\nBecause the claims of the '904 patent are directed to an abstract idea, the Court proceeds\nto Alice step two.\n16ii. AliceSt&pl\nId. Alice step two, we consider the elements of the claim, both individually and as an ordered\ncombination, to assess whether \"the limitations present in the claims represent a patent-eligible\napplication of the abstract idea.\" Content Extraction, 116 F.3d at 1347 (citation omitted). Merely\nreciting the use of a generic computer or adding the words \"apply it with a computer\" cannot\nconvert a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. Alice, 573 U.S. at 223;\nVersata Dev. Grp., Inc. v. SAP Am., Inc., 793 F.3d 1306,1332 (Fed. Cir. 2015). \"To save a patent\nat step two, an inventive concept must be evident in the claims.\" RecogniCorp, 855 F.3d at 1327\n(citation omitted).\nThe Court finds no saving inventive concept in claim 1 of the '904 patent. As discussed\nabove, claim 1 describes the use of generic computer components. D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claim 1\n(\"one or more computers\" and \"one or more data repositories\"). \"Nothing in the claims,\nunderstood in light of the specification, requires anything other than off-the-shelf, conventional\ncomputer, network, and display technology for gathering, sending, and presenting the desired\ninformation.\" Elec. Power Grp., 830 F.3d at 1355 (finding the claims do not recite an inventive\nconcept). The specification confirms that the claims merely use generic computer components.\nThe specification states that the '904 patent can be executed on \"any one or more processors of\nany kind of digital computer\" and that the data can be stored on \"all forms of non-volatile memory,\nincluding by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash\nmemory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., intemal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical\ndisks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks.\" D.I. 27-1, Ex. C at 23:37-39,23:48-54.\nIBM analogizes to DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P., 773 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir.\n2014), to argue that there is an inventive concept imder Alice step two. D.I. 40 at 15. In DDR\n17Holdings, LLC, the Federal Circuit found the asserted claims patent-eligible because they \"specify\nhow interactions with the Internet are manipulated to yield a desired result\" and recite \"a specific\nway to automate the creation of a composite web page by an 'outsource provider' that incorporates\nelements from multiple sources in order to solve a problem faced by websites on the Intemet.\"\n773 F.3d at 1258-59. Unlike DDR Holdings, LLC, claim 1 of the '904 patent fails to provide any\ntechnical detail. Claim 1 does not provide a specific way to solve a problem. Rather, claim 1\nrecites generic computer components to increase the efficiency in creating marketing promotions.\nMerely reciting an abstract idea performed on generic computer components, as claim 1 does in\nthe '904 patent, without more is not an inventive concept.\nIBM argues that the '904 patent recites at least the following inventive concepts: (1) \"it\nteaches a promotion template that generates promotion instances using dynamic attributes,\" and\n(2) \"it teaches the generation of'smart' promotion lists using specific steps.\" D.I. 40 at 13. Zynga\nresponds that these arguments \"fail at the outset,\" because even under IBM's proposed claim\nconstructions, these \"inventive concepts\" are not claimed. D.I. 47 at 7. IBM's proposed\nconstruction of \"promotion template\" need not include \"dynamic attributes\" and nothing in the\nclaims requires the claim term \"promotion list\" to be \"smart\" or require the \"promotion list\" to be\nused a certain way. \"To save a patent at step two, an inventive concept must be evident in the\nclaims.'\" Two-Way Media, 874 F.3d at 1338 (finding the claim failed to recite an inventive concept\neven though the written description provided a purported innovative concept) (emphasis added).\nIt is improper for IBM to point to imclaimed features of the '904 patent to support its Alice step\n18two analysis. ^\nIBM also alleges that claini 1 \"teaches software that generates (1) promotion instances\nfrom a promotion template and (2) the subsequent creation of promotion lists from those promotion\ninstances in an ordered sequence .... Claim 1 teaches software-based data structures that\nsequentially generate dynamically tailored promotions and bundle them into promotion bundles.\"\nD.I. 40 at 14 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). However, the steps in claim 1 merely\ndescribe a conventional order of operation of the invention\u2014^generating a promotion, filtering a\ndatabase of promotion, assigning the selected promotion to a list, and then finally storing the\npromotion list. See Two-Way Media, 874 F.3d at 1339 (finding no inventive concept ofthe ordered\ncombination of claim limitations because \"[t]he claim uses a conventional ordering of steps\u2014^first\nprocessing the data, then routing it, controlling it, and monitoring its reception\u2014^with conventional\ntechnology to achieve its desired result.\").\u00ae IBM's alleged inventive concepts are not tethered to\n\u00ae After briefing on the Motion was completed, IBM filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority and\ncited to Cooperative Entertainment v. Kollective Tech., Inc., 50 F.4th 127 (Fed. Cir. 2022) as\nsubsequent authority to support its opposition to the Motion. D.I. 56. IBM, however, fails to\nexplain how its Notice of Supplemental Authority supports any of its arguments. Regardless, the\nCourt finds Cooperative Entertainment distinguishable. The Federal Circuit in Cooperative\nEntertainment fovmd that the claim language \"recites the allegedly inventive concept of a particular\nnetwork structure for sharing content through a dynamic P2P network.\" Id. at 131. The Federal\nCircmt foimd the inventive concept was claimed in the claims. In this action, IBM points to\nunclaimed features of the '904 patent to support its inventive concept arguments.\n\u00ae IBM also cites to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (\"PTAB\") Final Written Decision ia its\nbriefing and states, \"the '904 patent's improvement over the prior art included 'the sequential\nnature and the specific order of the claim elements.'\" D.I. 40 at 14 n.3 (citing D.I. 27 1f80); see\nalso id. at 14 (\"Claim 1 teaches software-based data structures that sequentially generate\ndynamically tailored promotions and bimdle them into promotion bundles.\" (citing Zillow Group,\nInc. et al. v. Int'l Bus. Macks. Corp., IPR 2020-01656, Paper 33 at 9-10 (March 3, 2022))). The\nCourt agrees with Zynga that the PTAB's Final Written Decision \"did not suggest the ordered\nsequence captures any supposed inventive concept underlying IBM's step-two argument.\" D.I. 47\nat 9 n.5. During the BPR proceeding, the PTAB was evaluating whether the '904 patent was valid\nunder \u00a7 102, not whether the '904 patent is directed to patent-eligible subject matter imder \u00a7 101.\n19the claim language of the '904 patent. See D.I. 40 at 13,14.\nThus, the Court finds no inventive concept that transforms the claims into a patent-eligible\napplication of the abstract idea.\nc. Representativeness\nThe parties dispute whether claim 1 of the '904 patent is representative. For the reasons\nstated below, the Court finds claim 1 representative of all claims of the '904 patent for purposes\nof determining whether the claims recite patent-eligible subject matter.\nClaim 1 recites \"producing\" or \"generating\" promotions using a template, \"searching\" for\npromotions that match certain attributes specified in a search query, \"assigning\" the promotions to\na promotion list, and \"storing the promotion list.\" In its briefing, Zynga explains why claims 2-21\n\"are directed to the same abstract idea [described in claim 1] and include no inventive step.\" D.I.\n30 at 18-20.^ For example, Zynga notes that dependent claims 3 and 13 recite displaying \"the one\nor more promotion instances stored in the electronic medium in a searchable and browsable view.\"\nD.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claims 3,13. Zynga argues that \"the Federal Circuit has repeatedly recognized\nthat 'graphical user interface' elements are 'well-known computer components' that do not save a\nclaim from abstraction or constitute and inventive concept.\" D.I. 30 at 19 (citing Capital One\nBank (USA), 792 F.3d at 1368-69). Zynga provides similar analysis for the other claims. See D.I.\n30 at 18-20. Thus, Zynga argues that claim 1 is representative.\nIBM vaguely criticizes Zynga's argument that claim 1 is representative, but, other than\ndependent claim 2, IBM fails to provide meaningful argxmients as to the distinctive significance\nof claims 3-21. See D.I. 40 at 17-18. Thus, IBM waives its representativeness argument for claims\n^ Zynga also notes that claim 1 of the '904 patent is the only claim that is specifically asserted in\nIBM's First Amended Complaint. See D.I. 30 at 18 (citing D.I. 271157).\n20not analyzed separately, i.e., claims 3-21. See Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.Sd 1360,1365 (Fed.\nCir. 2018) (\"Courts may treat a claim as representative in certain situations, such as if the patentee\ndoes not present any meaningful argument for the distinctive significance of any claim limitations\nnot found in the representative claim or if the parties agree to treat a claim as representative.\").\nAs to dependent claim 2, IBM argues it teaches \"data structures that allow a user to modify\npromotion instances and promotion lists during the promotion management campaign.\" D.I. 40\nat 17 (emphasis in original). The Court disagrees with IBM. Dependent claim 2 recites:\nThe method of claim 1 wherein assigning the selected promotion instances to the\npromotions list comprises:\nquerying promotion instances to find one or more matching promotion\ninstances having matching attributes to one or more of the promotion\nattributes; and\nat runtime, adding the matching promotion instances to the promotions list.\nD.I. 27-1, Ex. C at claim 2.\nThe first limitation describes \"querying promotion instances.\" This limitation merely\nteaches searching and filtering data. As noted by Zynga during oral argument, this limitation\n\"doesn't tell you how to do anything. There's no structure. There's no technological\nimprovement.\" D.I. 70 at 14:19-24. IBM also points to the \"at runtime\" limitation to support its\ninventive concept argument. IBM construes \"at runtime\" to mean \"during the promotion\nmanagement campaign\" and construes \"promotion management campaign\" to mean \"the\nexecution of assigning promotion instances to entities that are intended recipients for specific\nmarketing communications.\" D.I. 40 at 7. Even adopting IBM's proposed constructions, the\n\"inventive concept\" that IBM points to is an unclaimed feature of dependent claim 2\u2014^the claim\ndoes not describe modifying the promotion during the promotion management campaign.\nDependent claim 2 recites completing the following two steps simultaneously: (1) adding a\n21promotion to a list and (2) assigning the promotion to the target audience. These are additional\ndata organization steps.\nThus, the Court concludes claim 1 is representative because all of the claims of the '904\npatent \"are substantially similar and linked to the same abstract idea.\" Content Extraction, 116\nF.3d at 1348.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, the '904 patent is directed to patent-ineligible subject matter\nimder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. Thus, the Court grants Zynga's Motion.
