No. 19-507-LPS \nKelli Evonca Sakinah Aliahmed, Sussex Correctional Institution, Georgetown, Delaware, and \nMuhammad Aliahmed, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiffs. \nMay 27, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION ~e .... x/1 \\~ \\ v--, \nST~ U.S. CircmtJudge: ' \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Hermione K. I. Winter (\"Winter\"), an inmate at the Sussex Correctional Institution \nin Georgetown, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.1 (D.I. 3) Winter was \nhoused at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center (''JVCC\") in Smyrna, Delaware, when she \ncommenced this action. She appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. \n(D.I. 5) Winter, now proceeding as Kelli Evonca Sakinah Aliahmed (\"K. Aliahmed\") and \nMuhammad Aliahmed (\"M. Aliahmed\") (together \"Plaintiffs\")2, filed an amended complaint on July \n6, 2020, naming additional plaintiffs and new defendants. (D.I. 18) The Amended Complaint is the \noperative pleading. The Court proceeds to review and screen the Amended Complaint pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and\u00a7 1915A(a). \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe original complaint was dismissed as legally frivolous and the Court determined that \namendment was futile. (D .I. 9, 10) K. Aliahmed was given leave to amend upon reconsideration. \n(D .I. 16, 17) The Amended Complaint adds as plaintiffs The People of Delaware, Inmates of \nDelaware, Transexuals of Delaware Prisons, and M. Aliahmed. It dismissed all the original \ndefendants and added new defendants John &Jane Does ofDDOC and DDOJ (\"Doe \nDefendants.\"). (D.I. 18) \nThe Amended Complaint contains the following counts: Count I, Racketeering; Count II, \nJob Discrimination; Count III, Lack of Available Grievance; Count IV, ADA Discrimination; \n1 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived her of a \nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See \nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n2 More recently, Plaintiff changed her name to Cea G. Mai. (See D.I. 33) \n1 Counts V and VI, Retaliation; and Count VII, Religious Discrimination. Plaintiffs seek \ncompensatory damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from \nsuch relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (informa \npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions). The \nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to a prose plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Alleghe'!J, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiffs proceed prose, their pleading is liberally \nconstrued and the Amended Complaint, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent \nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Doolry v. \nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020); see also Grqyson v. Mqyview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d \nCir. 2002). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal \ntheory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or delusional\" factual scenario.'\" Doolry v. Wetzel, 957 \nF.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule \n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before \n2 dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted \npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a \nPlaintiffs leave to amend unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grqyson v. Mqyview \nState Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bel/At!. Corp. v. Twomb/y, 550 \nU.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations\" are not required, a complaint must do \nmore than simply provide \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.\" Davis v. Abington Mem'! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Cata/ysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, \n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citingAshcrl!ft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,678 (2009) and Twomb/y, 550 U.S. at 570). \nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See \nJohnson v. City of She!ry, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect \nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nUnder the pleading regime established by Twomb/y and Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency \nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a \nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume \ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See \nConne!/y v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 \n3 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task \nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nA. Non-Attorneys \nThe Amended Complaint is signed by Plaintiffs K. Aliahmed and M. Aliahmed. Neither are \nattorneys. As non-attorneys, they may not act as attorneys for the other named Plaintiffs (i.e., The \nPeople of Delaware, Inmates of Delaware, and Transexuals of Delaware). Each may only represent \nherself or himself in this court. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654; see also Osei-Afriye v. The Medical College of \nPenn.rylvania, 937 F.2d 876 (3d Cir. 1991) (non-lawyer appearingpro se may not act as attorney for his \nchildren); In the Matter of Cho/'ecki, 2000 WL 679000, at *2 (E.D. Pa. May 22, 2000. \nB. Racketeering \nCount I is presented as a racketeering claim. Presumably, Plaintiffs attempt to raise a civil \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") claim. The civil RICO statute \ncreates a cause of action for \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a \nviolation of section 1962 of this chapter.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). \nTo state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege the following elements: \n\"(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\" Sedima, S.P.RL. \nv. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479,496 (1985). The RICO statute defines \"racketeering activity'' by \nenumerating an exhaustive list of predicate acts. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). A \"pattern\" of \nracketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1961(5). \nWhen a person alleges an injury under RICO, the alleged injury must arise from an unlawful \nact specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (1). See Smith v. Hildebrand, 244 F. App'x 288, 290 (11th Cir. 2007) \n4 (citing Beck v. Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 504-06 (2000)). \"[I]njuries to property are not actionable under \nRICO unless they result in tangible financial loss to the plaintiff.\" Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d 472, \n483 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); see also Guerrero v. Gates, 442 F.3d \n697, 707 (9th Cir. 2006) (\"To recover under RICO, the individual 'must show proof of concrete \nfinancial loss' and must demonstrate that the loss was proximately caused by the racketeering \nactivity.\"). \nThe Amended Complaint alleges in a conclusory manner that the systems of the prison are \n\"conducted in a mass manner that extorts both inmates and their loved ones out of the money,\" that \nthe \"cruel environment caused by the four prisons' corrupt system steals people's money on a large \nmassive level,\" and that inmates are charged fees to use tablets, telephones, and the commissary at \nincreased costs to inmates and with a substantial profit to the prison. (D.I. 18 at 9, 11, 12) At most, \nPlaintiffs allege one predicate act: extortion. A \"pattern\" of racketeering activity requires at least two \npredicate acts of racketeering activity. In addition, the allegations do not state that Plaintiffs suffered \nany injury. Rather, the allegations refer to injuries to \"people,\" \"inmates,\" and \"their loved ones,\" \nbut not to Plaintiffs. The allegations are wholly insufficient to state a valid RICO claim. Also, \nPlaintiffs have failed to allege any tangible financial loss to themselves. \nPlaintiffs have failed to state a RICO claim as the Amended Complaint fails to make \nsufficient \"factual allegations ... enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the \nassumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.\" Twomb/y, 550 \nU.S. at 555. Therefore, the RICO claim will be dismissed. \nC. 42 u.s.c. 1983 \nThe Court liberally construes Counts II, III, V, VI, and VII as raising claims under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983. Count II alleges job discrimination against transgenders and transexuals. Count III alleges \n5 the inability to exhaust administrative remedies under the current grievance system. Count V alleges \nproperty destruction, theft, and loss in monopolization, and retaliation. Count VI alleges a biased \nand targeted retaliation system against LGBTQ2SIA inmates. Count VII alleges religious \ndiscrimination. \nLiability in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action is personal in nature; to be liable, a defendant must \nhave been personally involved in the wrongful conduct. In other words, defendants are \"liable only \nfor their own unconstitutional conduct.\" Barkes v. First Corr. Med, Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 316 (3d Cir. \n2014), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Tqylor v. Barkes, 135 S.Ct. 2042 (2015). \"Because vicarious liability \nis inapplicable to ... \u00a7 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, \nthrough the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.\" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 676. \nThere are no allegations in Counts II, III, V, VI, or VII directed to any Doe Defendant that \nindicate personal involvement in violating Plaintiffs rights. The claims are deficiently pled and, \ntherefore, Counts II, III, V, VI, and VII will be dismissed. \nD. ADA \nCount IV alleges discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act but it does not \nindicate which Title was allegedly violated. Plaintiff K. Aliahmed alleges a disability by reason of \ngender dysphoria or as a transexual. She alleges the prisons, including SCI, Gander Hill, and \nJTVCC, all have a discriminatory gender job eligibility system in place and that an inmate is not \nconsidered if she or he is trans or intersex and, if an inmate is hired, discrimination quickly removes \nthe inmate from the position. (D.I. 18 at 16-22) \nK. Aliahmed does not indicate if her claim is raised under Title I or Title II of the ADA. \nRegardless, she raises the claim against John and Jane Does. Under either Title, the claim fails \nbecause there is no individual damages liability under Title I and Title II of the ADA. See Koslow v. \n6 Penn!Jlvania, 302 F.3d 161, 178 (3d Cir. 2002) (\"[T]here appears to be no individual liability for \ndamages under Title I of the ADA.\"); Boggi v. Med Review and Accrediting Council, 415 F. App'x 411, \n415 (3d Cir. 2011) (individual defendants cannot be sued in their individual capacities under ADA); \nEmerson v. Thiel Col., 296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2002) (no individual liability arises under Title II of \nADA). Accordingly, the ADA claim will be dismissed. \nE. Plaintiff M. Aliahmed \nThe Amended Complaint added M. Aliahtned as a defendant. M. Aliahtned is a pro se litigant \nwho is presently incarcerated, and who joined this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 without \nprepayment of the filing fee or a request to proceed in Jonna pauperis. M. Aliahtned will be ordered to \nsubmit a request to proceed in Jonna pauperis and a certified copy of his prison trust fund account \nstatement. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss the Amended Complaint as frivolous and \nfor failure to state claims upon which relief may be granted pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) \nand (ii) and 1915A(b)(1); and (2) require M. Aliahtned to submit a request to proceed in Jonna pauperis \nand a certified copy of his prison trust fund account statement. Plaintiffs will be given leave to file a \nsecond amended complaint. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n7 "}
