Pro Se Plaintiffs.\n\nNovember 14, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nWILLIAMS, U.S. District Judge:\nL INTRODUCTION\n\nJustin Erskine, Lateef Dickerson, Gerrin Wallace, Trey Bowden, Donald L.\nMcMillan, Michael Cummings, Kevon Brownlee, Christopher Waterman, Bryan\nA. Neal,! Jerry McGinnis, Michael Ellingsen, and Phillip M. Smith (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d),\nall inmates at Sussex Correctional Institution (\u201cSCI\u201d), filed this action pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d (D.I. 2) They appear pro se and have been granted leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis. Erskine has filed a motion for class certification (D.I.\n4) and a request for counsel (D.I. 5) This Court proceeds to screen the Complaint\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \u00a7 1915A(a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs are housed in the Medium Building at SCI. (D.I. 2 at \u00a7 2)\nMedium housing consists of four tiers. (/d. at \u00a7 4) The living area on each tier is\nan open dormitory setting of approximately 1600 square feet with no cells and no\ndividers between the bunks. (/d. at \u00a7\u00a7 4,5) Plaintiff allege that Defendants\nCaptain Joshua Niblett, Lieutenant Michael Maans, Lieutenant Kevin Bates, and\n\nClayton Morgan indicated that Plaintiffs are not allowed to access any space off\n\n' Bryan A. Neal was dismissed for failure to submit the required authorization form. (See\nD.I. 81) He subsequently submitted the authorization (see D.I. 113) and will be reinstated\nas a plaintiff.\n\n? Other inmates who joined in the suit have been dismissed. (See D.I. 81, 119)\n\n1\nthe tiers for purposes of recreation or exercise, and they are not permitted to\nexercise anywhere on the tier, including the chow hall. (/d. at J] 7, 8, 11)\nPlaintiffs allege the conditions make it difficult to have consistent and regular\naccess to outdoor recreation, that Medium Housing is not provided with air\nconditioning or proper ventilation, and they are refused access to the air\nconditioned chow hall for recreation purposes or a reprieve from the extreme\nsummer heat. (/d. at [J 22, 23, 24)\n\nInmates housed on the Medium Building are scheduled one hour of\ngym/yard access per day and it was canceled at least 21 times during the first 37\ndays of 2022. (/d. at J] 12, 13) Plaintiffs allege that inmates who serve\ndisciplinary sanctions (sometimes up to 90 days) are not allowed exercise because\nthey are not permitted access to the gym/yard. (/d. at J] 14, 15) Plaintiffs allege\nthat regardless of whether any of them have served sanction time in Medium\nHousing, they are not permitted to exercise on the tier, even when gym/yard is\ncanceled, and they are subject to long periods without exercise time. (/d. at J 19)\n\nGrievances seeking permission to exercise on the tier have been returned as\nnon-grievable on the basis that the matter was previously grieved and denied by\n\nDefendants Warden Truman Mears and/or Deputy Warden John Beck and Security\nMajor Marvella. (/d. at ff 16-17) Defendant DOC Bureau Chief John Doe upheld\nthe denial on appeal. (Jd. at 7 18)\n\nPlaintiffs allege the foregoing violates their rights under the Eighth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution because the prohibition from\nexercising on the tiers causes a threat to their physical and mental health. They\nseek declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive\ndamages. (Id. at 4-5)\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is\nfrivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or\nseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\nforma pauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks\nredress from a governmental defendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions\nbrought with respect to prison conditions). The Court must accept all factual\nallegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro\nse plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\n\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiffs proceed pro se,\n\n3\ntheir pleading is liberally construed and their Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully\npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by\nlawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. Apr. 27, 2020) (quoting Neitzke\nv. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard\nused when deciding Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions. See\nTourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)).\nHowever, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint\n\n4\nunless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State\nHosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nUSS. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly and Iqbal, a court\n\nreviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the\nelements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of\ntruth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their\nveracity and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\nSee Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016); see also\nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is\nplausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw\non its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Jd.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Grievances\n\nPlaintiffs allege that Mears, Beck, Wise, and Doe violated their rights when\nthey failed to grant grievances and requests to restore their opportunity for\nexercise. (D.I. 2 at921) The filing of prison grievances is a constitutionally\nprotected activity. Robinson v. Taylor, 204 F. App\u2019x 155, 157 (3d Cir. 2006). To\nthe extent that Plaintiffs base their claims upon their dissatisfaction with the\ngrievance procedure or denial of grievances, the claims fail because an inmate does\nnot have a \u201cfree-standing constitutionally right to an effective grievance process.\u201d\nWoods v. First Corr. Med., Inc., 446 F. App\u2019x 400, 403 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Flick\nv. Alba, 932 F.2d 728, 729 (8th Cir. 1991)). Indeed, the denial of grievance\n\n6\nappeals does not in itself give rise to a constitutional claim as Plaintiffs are free to\nbring a civil rights claim in District Court. Winn v. Department of Corr., 340 F.\nApp\u2019x 757, 759 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing Flick v. Alba, 932 F.2d at 729).\n\nPlaintiffs cannot maintain constitutional claims based upon their perception\nthat the grievances were not properly processed, that they were denied, or that the\ngrievance process is inadequate. Therefore, the Court will dismiss all grievance\nclaims as legally frivolous. The Court finds amendment futile as to this claim.\n\nB. Recreation\n\nPlaintiffs allege that: (1) Niblett, Maans, and Bates intentionally restricted\ntheir opportunity for physical exercise by prohibiting them from exercising on the\ntiers causing a threat to Plaintiffs\u2019 physical and mental health (DI. 2 at J 20); (2)\nMears, Beck, Wise, and Doe violated their rights when they created conditions that\nmade it difficult to have consistent and regular access to outdoor recreation which\ncauses a threat to Plaintiffs\u2019 physical and mental health (id. at { 22); and (3)\nNiblett, Maans, Bates, Mears, Beck, Wise, and Doe refused to provide Plaintiffs\naccess to the chow hall for recreation purposes (id. at J 24).\n\nThe denial of exercise or recreation can result in a constitutional violation.\n\u201c[MlJeaningful recreation \u2018is extremely important to the psychological and physical\n\nwell-being of the inmates.\u201d\u201d Peterkin v. Jeffes, 855 F.2d 1021, 1031 (3d Cir. 1988)\n7\n(quoting Spain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189, 199 (9th Cir. 1979)). The lack of\nexercise, however, can only rise to a constitutional level \u201cwhere movement is\ndenied and muscles are allowed to atrophy, [and] the health of the individual is\nthreatened.\u201d Spain, 600 F.2d at 199. Hence, a constitutional violation will occur\nonly when the deprivation of exercise extends for a prolonged period of time and\ntangible physical harm resulting from the lack of exercise is demonstrated.\n\nHere, Plaintiffs do not allege deprivations of exercise for prolonged periods\nof time. At most, they complain there not allowed outdoor recreation for 21 days\nduring the first part of 2022. This is not a substantial deprivation. See Barndt v.\nWenerowicz, 698 F. App\u2019x 673, 677 (3d Cir. 2017) (finding temporary denial of\nout of cell exercise for twenty-eight days was not a substantial deprivation);\nPearson v. Ramos, 237 F.3d 881, 884 (7th Cir. 2001) (finding denial of yard\nprivileges for no more than ninety days not cruel and unusual punishment; Knight\nv. Armontrout, 878 F.2d 1093, 1096 (8th Cir. 1989) (finding denial of outdoor\nrecreation for thirteen days not cruel and unusual punishment).\n\nWith regard to indoor recreation, \u201cthe lack of indoor facilities might be less\nthan ideal . . . [but] does not constitute a violation of . . . eighth amendment rights.\u201d\nPeterkin v. Jeffes, 855 F.2d at 1031-32. Nor do Plaintiffs allege tangible physical\n\nharm resulting from lack of exercise. Rather, they allege only a \u201cthreat to\n\n8\nPlaintiffs\u2019 physical and mental health\u201d; not that they suffered any actual ill effects.\n\u201c[A] temporary denial of outdoor exercise with no medical effects is not a\nsubstantial deprivation.\u201d Fantone v. Herbik, 528 F. App\u2019x 123, 127 (3d Cir. 2013)\n(quoting May v. Baldwin, 109 F.3d 557, 565 (9th Cir. 1997)). The Complaint\ncontains no allegations that Plaintiffs suffered ill effects or sought medical care due\nto lack of exercise\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 recreation/lack of exercise claims do not rise to the level of a\nconstitutional violation. Therefore, the claims will be dismissed. The Court finds\namendment futile as to this claim.\n\nC. Conditions of Confinement\n\nPlaintiffs allege that: (1) Mears, Beck, Wise, and Doe violated their rights\nby not providing air conditioning in the summer when temperatures routinely\nexceeded 90 degrees (id. at J 23); (2) Niblett, Maans, Bates, Mears, Beck Wise,\nand Doe refused to provide Plaintiffs access to the air conditioned chow hall for a\nreprieve from the extreme summer heat (id. at 24); and (3) Mears, Beck, Wise,\nand Doe housed 44 inmates in a space of 1,600 square feet with no tables, chairs,\nor opportunity for meaningful recreation or time off the tier all of which contribute\nto excessive noise, idleness, and crowding, with bunks not even six feet apart (id.\n\nat J 25).\nThe Eighth Amendment \u201cprohibits any punishment which violates civilized\nstandards and concepts of humanity and decency.\u201d Young v. Quinlan, 960 F.2d\n351, 359 (3d Cir. 1992), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Nyhuis\nv. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 71 n.7 (3d Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). To prevail against\nprison officials on a claim that an inmate\u2019s conditions of confinement violated the\nEighth Amendment, the inmate must meet two requirements: (1) the deprivation\nalleged must be, objectively, sufficiently serious,\u201d and (2) the \u201cprison official must\nhave a sufficiently culpable state of mind.\u201d Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834,\n(1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The first element is\nsatisfied when an inmate is deprived of \u201cthe minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s\nnecessities.\u201d Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 299 (1991). The second element is\nsatisfied when an inmate shows that prison officials acted with deliberate\nindifference to the inmate\u2019s health or safety or conditions of confinement that\nviolated the inmate\u2019s constitutional rights. Jd. at 302-03.\n\nWhen considering whether conditions of confinement violated the Eighth\nAmendment, courts recognize that \u201cthe Constitution does not mandate comfortable\nprisons, and prisons . . . which house persons convicted of serious crimes, cannot\n\nbe free of discomfort.\u201d Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 349 (1981). \u201cTo the\nextent that such conditions are restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the\npenalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.\u201d Jd. at 347.\n\nPlaintiffs allege they were not provided air conditioning during the summer\nwhen temperatures exceeded 90 degrees and not allowed access to the air\nconditioned chow hall for a reprieve from the summer heat. The Eighth\nAmendment is concerned with both the \u201cseverity\u201d and the \u201cduration\u201d of a\nprisoner\u2019s exposure to inadequate cooling and ventilation. See Rosa-Diaz v.\nHarry, 2017 WL 1316946, at *9 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 2, 2017), report and\nrecommendation adopted, 2017 WL 1283771 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 6, 2017) (citing\nDixon v. Godinez, 114 F.3d 640, 643 (7th Cir. 1997) (\u201c[I]t is not just the severity of\nthe cold, but the duration of the condition, which determines whether the\nconditions of confinement are unconstitutional.\u201d). Here, Plaintiffs do not allege a\nrisk of injury from the condition. Rather, they complain it was hot and they\nwanted a break from the heat. A prisoner\u2019s mere discomfort, without more, does\nnot offend the Eighth Amendment. Jd. at *9 (citing Woods v. Edwards, 51 F.3d\n577, 581 (Sth Cir. 1995)\n\nPlaintiffs also complain of excessive noise. To meet the objective criteria of\nan Eighth Amendment claim, a plaintiff must show that the risk of injury from the\n\nconditions to which he was exposed was \u201cso grave that it violates contemporary\n\n11\nstandards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk. \u201d Helling v.\nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993). The Complaint does not allege the noise on\nthe tier was so excessive and pervasive that it posed a serious risk of injury to\nPlaintiffs. See Lunsford v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1574, 1580 (7th Cir. 1994). At most,\nPlaintiffs allege in a conclusory manner that the noise is excessive. This, however,\n\u201ccannot fairly be said to inflict cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d Peterkin v. Jeffes,\n855 F.2d at 1027.\n\nPlaintiffs complain of conditions on the tier and allege the conditions\ncontribute to excessive noise (discussed above), crowding, and no opportunity for\nmeaningful recreation (discussed above). The Complaint does not contain\nsufficient factual allegations that show constitutional violations occurred. In\nessence, the vague and cursory allegations complain \u201cof [] inconvenient and\nuncomfortable situation[s]\u201d; however, \u201cthe Constitution does not mandate\ncomfortable prisons.\u201d Carson v. Mulvihill, 488 F. App\u2019x 554, 560 (3d Cir. 2012)\n(quoting Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 349). The allegations fail to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted. See Carter v. Owens, 2017 WL 3107204, at *10 (D.N.J.\nJuly 21, 2017) (finding that, without additional details about the nature of\nprisoner\u2019s inadequate \u201cdayroom\u201d space claim, prisoner \u201chas not demonstrated that\n\ndenial of access to it was sufficiently serious to deprive him of the minimal\n\n12\nmeasure of life's necessities\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 conditions of confinement claims will be\ndismissed. Plaintiffs will be given leave to amend the claim.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) reinstate Bryan A. Neal as a\nplaintiff; (2) deny as premature without prejudice to renew Plaintiff Justin\nErskine\u2019s motion for class certification (D.I. 4) and request for counsel (D.I. 5); (3)\ndismiss the Complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) and\n1915A(b)(1); and (4) give Plaintiffs leave to amend the conditions of confinement\nclaims. Amendment is futile as to the grievance and recreation claims.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n"}
