INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Randolph Lucas (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), a former inmate in the Delaware Department of\nCorrection, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the Superior Court of the State of\nDelaware in and for New Castle County on June 4, 2019. (D.I. 1-1 at 5) The case was removed to\nthis Court on July 17, 2019. (D.I. 1) The Amended Complaint is the operative pleading. (D.I. 30)\nBefore the Court is Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and Plaintiffs opposition. (D.I. 59)\ni; BACKGROUND'\n\nOn June 9, 2017, Defendants Corporals David Schulz (\u201cSchulz\u201d) and David Ham (\u201cHam\u201d)\nwere on patrol in the area of N. Monroe Street and W. 4th Street in Wilmington, Delaware. (D.I. 61\nat 5) Schulz wore a body camera. (Id.) Plaintiff was a passenger in a maroon Chrysler Town and\nCountry minivan that did not have a license plate. (Id.) Schulz and Ham stopped the minivan and\nspoke to its passengers, including Plaintiff, who was sitting in the rear passenger seat. (Id.)\n\nSchulz returned to his police vehicle, ran warrant checks on all passengers, and discovered\nthat Plaintiff, as well as the driver of the minivan, had active capiases for their arrest. (Id.)\nDefendants, Corporals Thomas Lynch (\u201cLynch\u201d) and Sean Nolan (\u201cNolan\u201d), responded to assist\nSchulz and Ham with the traffic stop. (Id. at 7) None of the officers involved are identified in the\nbody camera recording; however, reports filed by the officers describe their roles in the incident.\n(D.L. 61 at 5-10) A supetvisor\u2019s investigative report of the incident indicates that Nolan, Schulz,\nLynch, and Ham, as well as Corporal G. MacNamara (a non-defendant), were involved in the\n\nincident. (Id. at 12)\n\n' The facts are construed in favor of Plaintiff, the non-moving party.\n\n1\nWhen the officers asked Plaintiff to exit the vehicle, he ran, and a foot chase ensued. (D.1.\n30 at 5; D.L 61 at 3 body camera footage at 8:23; D.I. 61 at 7, 8) Schulz, Lynch, and Nolan saw\nPlaintiff holding his waistband as he fled. (D.1.651 at 5, 8, 10) Plaintiff ignored the officers\u2019 verbal\ncommands to stop. (Jd) Nolan wamed Plaintiff that he would be tased if he did not stop running.\n(Id. at 8) Next, as Plaintiff was running, Nolan saw Plaintiff remove a handgun from his waistband\nand hold the firearm in his right hand. (Id.)\n\nSchulz saw Plaintiff and the assisting officers descend a set of steps onto N. Adams Street\nand saw Nolan discharge his taser. (Id. at 5) The taser probes struck Plaintiff in the back, and\nPlaintiff was tasered for five seconds. (Id. at 8, 29) Plaintiff dropped the gun and fell to the ground.\n(Id. at 8, 10)\n\nAccording to Schulz and Lynch, after Plaintiff had been tasered, Lynch attempted to take\nhim into custody, but Plaintiff continued to actively resist arrest and refused repeated commands to\nplace his hands behind his back. (D.I. 61 at 3 body camera footage at 8:45; D.I. 61 at 10) According\nto Plaintiff's viewing of the body camera footage, Lynch straddled over Plaintiff and punched him,\nMacNamata stomped on his right leg; and Schultz held Plaintiff's right arm. (Id at 3 body camera\nfootage at 8:47-8:52) According to Schulz\u2019s report, he assisted Lynch by gaining control of\nPlaintiff's arm and placing it behind Plaintiff's back. (Id. at 8) Lynch\u2019s report states that he was able\nto gain control of Plaintiff's hands and place him in custody. (Id. at 10; D.L. 61 at 3 body camera\nfootage at 8:59-9:02) Nolan found a loaded Glock 22 handgun on the ground that Plaintiff had\nbeen carrying. (D.I. 61 at 3 body camera footage at 9:23; D.I. 61 at 10, 22)\n\nNolan and MacNamara transported Plaintiff to Wilmington Hospital for treatment. (Id. at\n15, 16) After Plaintiff was treated and released from the hospital, he was charged with resisting\n\narrest and possession of a firearm within 10 years of a prior conviction. (Id. at 6, 20)\nIn an interview, Plaintiff stated that he injured his right knee when he fell to the ground after\nbeing tased. (Id at 13) He also stated he had a head abrasion, and right wrist soreness as a result of\nthe fall. (Id) Medical records indicate Plaintiff suffered a contusion of the right knee and it was\nrecommended he take ibuprofen as needed for pain and follow-up with his physician. (D.I. 61 at 23;\nD.L 68 at 3) He also sustained a small abrasion with swelling to the right posterior parietal scalp\nwithout any tenderness and no lacerations. (D.I. 68 at 2, 3) During a medical follow-up on June 21,\n2017, Plaintiff provided a history of having a \u201crun in with the Wilmington Police on 6/9/17 and\nthey kicked him in his right knee.\u201d (Id at 5) Ata June 24, 2017 hospitalization for a knee tap,\nPlaintiff provided a history including that a police officer \u201cstomped on leg.\u201d? (Id. at 9-10)\n\nPlaintiff alleges excessive force by Ham, Schulz, Henry Law (\u201cLaw\u201d), Hugh Stephey\n(\u201cStephey\u201d), Nolan, and Lynch, and failure to intervene by Ham, Law, Stephey, Schulz, Lynch, and\nNolan, all in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n(D.I. 30 at 8) He seeks compensatory, disctetionary, punitive, and future damages. (Id. at 10)\n\nDefendants move for summary judgment on the grounds that they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity with respect to the Fourth Amendment claims relating to excessive force and failure to\nintervene because Plaintiff cannot establish a constitutional violation based upon the record\nevidence. Plaintiff opposes and seeks to amend to add MacNamara as a new defendant (alleging\n\nMacNamara stomped on his leg). (D.I. 67)\n\n2 A June 27, 2017 MRI of the right knee provided an impression of a \u201crupture of the anterior\ncruciate ligament, large joint effusion and multifocal marrow contusions. Possible small peripheral\ntear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. Extensive soft tissue edema about the knee.\u201d (Id.\nat 14)\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nUnder Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201c[t]he court shall grant summary\njudgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The moving patty bears the burden of\ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Lid. v.\nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 n.10 (1986). If the moving party has carried its burden, the\nnonmovant must then \u201ccome forward with \u2018specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for\ntrial.\u201d Id at 587 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).\n\nIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court must \u201cdraw all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh\nthe evidence.\u201d Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). If the Court can\ndetermine that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and that the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law, summary judgment is appropriate. See Hill v. City of Scranton, 411 F.3d\n118, 125 (3d Cit. 2005).\n\nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving patty must \u201cdo more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Matsushita, 475 U.S. at\n586; see also Podobnik v. U.S. Postal Serv., 409 F.3d 584, 594 (3d Cir. 2005) (stating party opposing\nsummary judgment \u201cmust present more than just bare assertions, conclusory allegations or\nsuspicions to show the existence of a genuine issue\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover,\nthe \u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise\nproperly supported motion for summary judgment;\u201d a factual dispute is genuine only where \u201cthe\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 417 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986).\nFinally, in determining whether a genuine dispute of material facts exists, a court may\nconsider video evidence of the events at issue. In a case where video evidence of the events exists, a\ncourt must view the facts \u201cin the light depicted by the video.\u201d Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 381\n(2007). A court \u201cneed not adopt the non-movant\u2019s version of the facts if the recording \u2018blatantly\ncontradict[s]\u2019 the non-movant\u2019s version \u2018so that no reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d\u201d. McDowell v.\nSherer, 374 F. App\u2019x 288, 292 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Scot, 550 U.S. at 380).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Personal Involvement\n\nDefendants move for summary judgment as to Stephey and Law for lack of personal\ninvolvement. Plaintiffs opposition does not address this ground for summary judgment.\n\nLiability in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action is personal in nature. Hence, to be liable, a defendant\nmust have been personally involved in the wrongful conduct. In other words, defendants are \u201cliable\nonly for their own unconstitutional conduct.\u201d Barkes v. First Corr. Med., Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 316 (3d\nCir. 2014), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Taylor v. Barkes, 575 U.S. 822 (2015). \u201cPersonal involvement\ncan be shown through allegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and acquiescence.\u201d\nRode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988). A defendant\u2019s knowledge of a risk to health\nand safety \u201ccan be proved indirectly by circumstantial evidence to the effect that the excessive risk\nwas so obvious that the official must have known of the risk.\u201d Thomas v. Tice, 948 F.3d 133, 138 (3d\nCir. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThere is no record evidence that Stephey and Law had any personal involvement in the June\n9, 2017 incident. No reasonable jury could find for Plaintiff on the claims he raises against them.\nTherefore, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the claims raised\n\nagainst Stephey and Law.\nB. Excessive Force and Failure to Intervene\n\nDefendants move for summary judgment on behalf of Lynch, Nolan, Ham, and Schulz on\nthe grounds that they are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the excessive force and\nfailure to intervene because the record evidence does not establish constitutional violations.\n\nPlaintiff's claims of excessive force are analyzed under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\n\u201creasonableness inquiry.\u201d Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The inquiry \u201cis an objective one: the question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are\n\u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to\ntheir underlying intent or motivation.\u201d Id. (citing Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 137-39 (1978);\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968)). The Court \u201cask[s] whether, from the perspective of the officer\nat the time of the incident and not with the benefit of hindsight,\u201d the officers were objectively\nreasonable in their use of force. Brown v. Makofka, 644 F. App\u2019x 139, 142 (3d Cir. 2016) (citing\nSantini v. Fuentes, 795 F.3d 410, 417 (3d Cir. 2015)). In determining whether the force used was\nobjectively reasonable, the Court carefully considers \u201cthe facts and circumstances of each particular\ncase, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to\nthe safety of the officers or others, and whether [the suspect] is actively resisting arrest or attempting\nto evade arrest by flight.\u201d Graham, 490 U.S. at 396.\n\nIn considering the force used to subdue Plaintiff, \u201c[nJot every push or shove, even if it may\nlater seem unnecessaty in the peace of a judge\u2019s chambers, violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d\nGraham, 490 U.S. at 396 (internal citations and quotations omitted); see a/so Woods v. Grant, 665 F.\nSupp. 2d 438, 445 (D. Del. 2009) (multiple taser use on fleeing suspect not unreasonable use of\n\nforce), afd, 381 F. App\u2019x 144 (3d Cir. 2010).\nThe record establishes that Plaintiff admitted he fled because he knew he had an outstanding\nwarrant; during the chase he was seen in possession of a handgun; Nolan deployed his taser only\nafter he warned Plaintiff he would do so if Plaintiff continued to flee and not obey commands to\nstop; Plaintiff did not drop his weapon until he was tasered; and video evidence shows that Plaintiff\ncontinued to resist even after he was tasered, on the ground, and while being handcuffed. Plaintiff\nargues that his leg was stomped, but the video does not depict that. Rather it shows an officer\nplacing his foot on Plaintiff. Nor can it be said that the officers holding Plaintiff down and\nattempting to subdue and handcuff used excessive force. Even crediting Plaintiff's account as true,\na mere ten seconds passed from the time Plaintiff fell to the ground to the time he was handcuffed.\n\nThe inquiry into the reasonableness of force is an objective one, made from the perspective\nof a reasonable officer at the scene. Having considered the use of a taser due to Plaintiff's flight\nfrom police officers, and having reviewed the video, the acts of Defendants were objectively\nreasonable when assessed from the vantage point of a reasonable officer on the scene. No\nreasonable jury could find for Plaintiff on the excessive force claims.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 motion on the issue of excessive force.\nBecause the Court finds that no constitutional violation occurted with respect to excessive force,\nPlaintiff also cannot succeed on his failure to intervene claims. See Nifas v. Coleman, 528 F. App\u2019x\n132, 135-36 (3d Cir. 2013) (citing Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 650 (3d Cir. 2002)).\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\u2019\n\n(D.I. 59) An appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n3 The Court does not address qualified immunity, as summary judgment will be granted on other\ngrounds.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nRANDOLPH LUCAS,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 19-1338-LPS\n: Superior Court of the State of\nOFFICER HAM, et al., : Delaware in and for New Castle County\n: C.A.
