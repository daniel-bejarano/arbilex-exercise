But \nthe law allows  good -faith competition : as long as  a business do es not mislead or lie, it \nmay brag and put down its competitor s. This case turns on whether Corporation Ser-\nvice Company crossed that lin e.  \nA competitor, Registered Agent Solutions, says Corporation Service made false or \nmisleading claims about Registered Ag ent. But its complaint does not support that \nallegation. Many of Corporation Service\u2019s statements  were true. Others were exag-\ngerations or predictions about the future. So Registered Agent \u2019s Lanham Act, state -\nstatute, and common -law claims fail.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nRegistered Agent  and Corporation Service are competitors in the legal- services \nindustry. D.I. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 1\u22122. Both act as agents for companies: they provide address es \nthat accept service of legal documents , then process those documents and forward \nthem to the client company. Each offers services nationwide. Id. \u00b6 10; D.I. 24, at 3\u22124.  \nOf the two companies, Registered Agent  is the new kid on the block. D.I. 24, at \n3\u22124. But it has grown quickly and was recently acquired by Lexitas , a group of legal \nservices providers. That set Registered Agent  up for the future and gave \u201ccurrent and \nfuture Lexitas customers access to [Registered Agent \u2019s] services.\u201d D.I. 20 \u00b6  12. \nCorporation Service saw that acquisition as a threat. D.I. 20 \u00b6 2. So it went on the \noffensive, emailing Registered Agent  customers and encouraging them to jump ship. \nId. at 17, 19.  It told them that Lexitas did not \u201ccurrently offer\u201d registered- agent 3 services, that Registered Agent \u2019s acquisition m ight lead to \u201c changes  and surprises,\u201d \nand that there had been \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d involving  filings in California. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17, \n19, 29.  \nRegistered Agent  saw this as a \u201cfalse advertising campaign \u2026 to promote [ Corpo-\nration Service\u2019s ] services by spreading false information \u2026 about [Registered Agent] .\u201d \nId. \u00b6 34. So it  asked Corporation Service to stop. Though Corporation Service assured \nits rival that it would desist, it kept reaching out to Registered Agent \u2019s customers. Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 37, 40.  \nSo Registered Agent  sued Corporation Service, asserting claims for false advertis-\ning, unfair competition, deceptive trade practices, and tortious interference with its \nbusiness. Corporation Service moves to dismiss. To survive, Registered Agent \u2019s com-\nplaint must contain enough facts to \u201cstate \u2026 claim[s] to relief that [are] plausible on \n[their] face.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  It does not.  \nII. REGISTERED AGENT \u2019S LANHAM ACT CLAIM FAILS \nBefore reaching the merits of Registered Agent \u2019s Lanham Act false -advertising  \nclaim, I must resolve a threshold issue.  Is that claim  governed by the heightene d Rule \n9(b) \u201cparticularity\u201d standard for pleading fraud  or the lesser plausibility standard \nused for all other claims ? See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).   \nSurprisingly, the Third Circuit has not answered that question yet. So I start from \nfirst principles. Rule 9(b) requires \u201cfraud or mistake \u201d to be plead with \u201c particularity. \u201d \nId. So w here a claim \u201csounds in fraud , \u2026  9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard ap-\nplies.\u201d In re Exxon Mobil Corp. Sec. Litig., 500 F.3d 189, 197 (3d Cir. 2007). Thus, 4 even if claims  do not necessarily involve fraud, they mu st meet the heightened plead-\ning standard if their  \u201cspecific factual allegations \u2026 charge defendants with fraud.\u201d \nShapiro v. UJB Fin. Corp., 964 F.2d 272, 287\u2013 89 (3d Cir.1992).  \nThat approach makes sense. Rule 9 ensures that claims of misrepresentation are \npleaded in detail. That \u201cpolic [y] [is] equally applicable to \u2026 misrepresentation claims \n\u2026 [under the] Lanham Act.\u201d Max Daetwyler Corp. v. Input Graphics, Inc. , 608 F. \nSupp. 1549, 1556 (E.D. Pa. 1985); see also Gensler v. Strabala, 764 F.3d 735, 737 (7th \nCir. 2014) (holding that when a Lanham Act claim asserts \u201ca form of fraud ,\u201d a court \nshould \u201cexpect [the] complaint to allege with particularity the nature of the griev-\nance\u201d under 9(b)).  \nHere, Registered Agent \u2019s Lanham Act claim sounds in fraud. The touchst one of \nfraud is the intent to mislead. So a claim \u201csound [s] in fraud\u201d if \u201c[t]he specific factual \nallegations on which [it] is based \u2026 aver that [a] defendant [] \u2018intentionally,\u2019 \u2018know-\ningly,\u2019 or \u2018recklessly\u2019 misrepresented \u2026 certain material information.\u201d Sh apiro , 964 \nF.2d at 287. Under that test, this case is clear cut: Registered Agent  alleges that \n\u201c[Corporation Service]  made its false and misleading statements knowingly and will-\nfully, or recklessly.\u201d D.I. 20 \u00b6\u00b6  58, 59.  \nThus, I will test th is Lanham Act claim under Rule 9(b). Registered Agent \u201cmust \nstate with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed. R. Civ.  P. 9(b). \nAnd it should \u201cinject [] precision \u2026 into [its] allegations\u201d by providing \u201cthe date, place \nor time of the fraud,\u201d and by stating \u201cwho made [the] misrepresentation to whom and 5 [its] general content.\u201d Kuhn Constr. Co. v. Ocean & Coastal Consultants, Inc. , 844 F.  \nSupp.  2d 519, 530 (D. Del. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nUnder that standard, Registered Agent  fails to state a claim under the Lanham \nAct. (Because the pleading standard is unsettled, I note that I would have reached \nthe same result for all but one of Registered Agent \u2019s statements  under  the laxer plau-\nsibility standard in  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ). \nA. Registered Agent  alleges no actionable misstatement  \nTo state a false -advertising claim under the Lanham Act, Registered Agent  must \nplead that:  \n\u2022 Corporation Service  \u201cmade false or misleading statements \u201d about Registered \nAgent \u2019s services in a \u201ccommercial advertis[ ement] or promotion\u201d;  \n\u2022 those statements were \u201cactual [ly] decepti [ve]\u201d or had a \u201ctendency to deceive\u201d;  \n\u2022 the deception was \u201clikely to influence purchasing decisions\u201d;  \n\u2022 Corporation Service\u2019s ad was distributed in interstate commerce;  and \n\u2022 Registered Agent  was likely injured as a result.  \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7  1125(a)(1)(B); Groupe SEB USA, Inc. v. Euro -Pro Operating LLC, 774 F.3d \n192, 198 (3d Cir. 2014)  (quoting Pernod Ricard USA, LLC v. Bacardi U.S.A., Inc.,  653 \nF.3d 241, 248 (3d Cir. 2011) ).  \nEach challenged statement  must  \u201csatisf[y] all [the] Lanham Act[\u2019s] requirements.\u201d \nVerisign, Inc. v. XYZ.COM LLC , 848 F.3d 292, 299 (4th Cir. 2017). Registered Agent  \nmay not \u201cmix and match statements, with some satisfying one Lanham Act elemen t \nand some satisfying others.\u201d Id.; see Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. v. 1 \u2013800 6 Contacts, Inc. , 299 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. 2002). Thus, I will analyze each of Cor-\nporation Service\u2019s alleged misstatements as separate claims .  \n1. Registered Agent \u201c handl e[s] [everything ] online.\u201d Registered Agent  says Corpo-\nration Service told a prospective Registered Agent  customer that it \u201chandle[s] [ every-\nthing ] online.\u201d D.I. 20 \u00b6  15; D.I. 20 -1, Ex. 1 . It complains that statement was false or \nmisleading becau se it has \u201cbrick and mo rtar locations across the country.\u201d D.I. 20 \n\u00b6 16. \nBut that claim suffers from a few defects. T o start, Registered Agent  does not \nmake its allegation precisely enough . It never  explain s who at Corporation Service \nsaid that  or when. See D.I. 20 -1, Ex. 1 .  \nPlus, even if it had given more detail, Registered Agent  does not explain  how a \nphone call  to a single customer counts as  \u201ccommercial adverting\u201d covered by the Lan-\nham Act.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7  1125(a)(1)(B). Advertisements are promo tions that are broadly \n\u201cdisseminated \u2026 to the relevant purchasing public \u2026 within [an] industry.\u201d Incarcer-\nated Ent., LLC v. CNBC LLC, 331 F. Supp. 3d 352, 358 (D. Del. 2018)  (quoting Gordon \n& Breach Sci. Publishers v. Am. Inst. Of Physics , 859 F. Supp. 152 1, 1535\u2013 36 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1994 )). Yet Corporation Service allegedly told just one customer that Reg-\nistered Agent  conducted its business online. That is not enough.  \nRegistered Agent  counters that, on a motion to dismiss,  I may not decide whether \nstatements are sufficiently broadcasted to be \u201cadvertising .\u201d D.I. 2 5, at 6 (citing Re-\nfundo, LLC v. Drake Enters., Ltd ., 2013 WL 1750016, at *5 (D.N.J. Apr. 22, 2013) ). \nTrue enough. B ut it must still allege \u201cenough facts to raise a reasonable expectation 7 that discovery will reveal evidence of [dissemination].\u201d N. J. Physicians United Recip-\nrocal Exch. v. Boynton & Boynton , Inc., No., 2014 WL 317179, at *5 (D.N.J. Jan. 28, \n2014)  (quoting Phillips v. C nty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir. 2008) ). And \nto do that, it must \u201cidentify some medium or means through which [ Corporation Ser-\nvice] disseminated information to a particular class of consumers.\u201d Id. (quoting Podi-\natrist Ass\u2019 n, Inc.  v. La Cruz Azul , 332 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2003)).  \nYet Registered Agent  does not explain how Corporation Service told customers  \nthat it was an online -only business.  Indeed, it does not even say the  statement was \ndistributed more broadly. So Registered Agent \u2019s first Lanham Act claim fails.  \n2. \u201cFraudulent activity.\u201d Registered Agent  next alleges that Corporation Service \nnotified Registered Agent\u2019s  customers that Corporation Service had detected \u201cfraud-\nulent activit y\u201d surrounding business filings with the California Secretary of State. \nD.I. 20 \u00b6  17; D.I. 20 -1, Ex.  4; Simi Valley , CA 93063, 2014 WL 12707311, at *4 (C.D. \nCal. June 2, 2014) (describing the filing requirement). To support that allegation, it \nattaches an email in which Corporation Service told Registered Agent  customers that \n\u201c[Corporation Service]  identified what appeared to be  unauthorized \u2026 filings in Cal-\nifornia ,\u201d touting  its \u201cinvestment in technology and service [s] [which ] allowed [it] to \nget in front of th[e] situation as it unfolded.\u201d D.I. 20 -1, Ex. 4.  \nBut as Registered Agent  concedes, those claims are not false. Californi a itself \nacknowledged  that it had received  fraudulent filings and said that it had notified \naffected  companies. D.I. 20 \u00b6  17. And Registered Agent  does not contest Corporation \nService\u2019s claim that its software detected the issue.  8 Instead, Registered Agent  argues that Corporation Service\u2019s email misleadingly \nsuggested that Registered Agent \u2019s customers were affected  by the fraud . Id. Yet that \nargument is implausible. Corporation Service\u2019s email does not mention Registered \nAgent . Plus, the email  makes clear that \u201cimpacted customers \u2026 whether [Corpora-\ntion Service]  clients or not\u201d had already been notified. D.I. 20 -1, Ex. 4 . So no reason-\nable customer could read the email and mistakenly think that their filings were in-\nvolved.  \n 3. \u201c[A]cquired by \u2026 a private equity [ firm].\u201d Registered Agent  also complains that \nits customers heard from Corporation Service that Registered Agent  had \u201cbeen ac-\nquired by APAX, a private equity company, and [was] assigned to Lexitas , \u2026 [a] court \nreporting and deposition company.\u201d D.I. 20 \u00b6  19.  \nThat email, Registered Agent  grumbles, is false: it was not acquired by APAX. \nInstead, it was acquired by \u201cChronicle Bidco Inc. ,\u201d the corporation that actually  owns \nLexitas. D.I. 20 \u00b6  12. Plus,  it says, Corporation Service\u2019s email falsely suggested that \n\u201c[Registered Agent]  was now being run by entit ies with no registered agent service \nexperience.\u201d D.I. 20 \u00b6  20.  \nBut the complaint does not support that theory. Even if Corporation Service\u2019s \nstatement was technically false and APAX was not involved in Registered Agent \u2019s \nacquisition , that statement is not material. No reasonable customer would care \nwhether Lexitas acquired Registered Agent  using APAX\u2019s investment or Chronicle \nBidco\u2019s investment. So it is not the kind of misstatement that \u201cis likely to influence 9 purchasing decisions.\u201d Groupe SEB USA , 774 F.3d at 198 (quoting Pernod Ricard , \n653 F.3d at  248)). \nCorporation Service\u2019s email also said that the acquisition might leave Registered \nAgent \u2019s customers \u201cat the mercy of \u2026 changes and surprises.\u201d D.I. 20 -1, Ex. 5. But \nthat claim is mere puffery, not a \u201cstatement[ ] of fact capable of being proven false.\u201d \nParker v. Learn the Skills Corp., 530 F. Supp. 2d 661, 679 (D. Del. 2008) . So it is not \nactionable under the Lanham Act.  \n4. \u201c[R]egistered agent services isn\u2019t a service they currently offer .\u201d Corporation Ser-\nvice allegedly told its rival\u2019s  customers that Registered Agent  did not \u201ccurrently offer\u201d \nregistered -agent services. D.I. 20 \u00b6  30. To support that assertion, Registered Agent  \nattaches an email Corporation Service sent to its customers. In relevant part, th at \nemail reads as follows:  \nI am following up on information you  likely received from your [Regis-\ntered Agent]  service rep. Now that they have been acquired by APAX, a \nprivate equity company, and have been assigned to Lexitas, their court \nreporting and deposition company. Most concerning and as you\u2019ll not ice \nfrom their website , is that registered agent services isn\u2019t a service they \ncurrently offer.  \nD.I. 20 \u00b6  29 (the bold  text is a hyperlink to Lexitas\u2019s website); D.I. 20 -1, Ex. 9.  \nFor Registered Agent \u2019s theory to work, the last sentence of the email must r efer \nto Registered Agent , not Lexitas. ( Registered Agent  does not dispute that Lexitas did \nnot offer registered -agent services .) But that is not a natural reading of the email. \nThe closest referent to \u201ctheir website\u201d is Lexitas, not Registered Agent . And t he hy-\nperlink goes to Lexitas\u2019s website, not Registered Agent \u2019s. So a reasonable consumer \nwould likely read the email to refer to Lexitas. Indeed, that reading is reinforced by 10 context. Corporation Service allegedly sent the email to Registered Agent  customers \nwho would know that Registered Agent  \u201ccurrently offer[s]\u201d registered- agent services \nbecause they had bought them. D.I. 20 \u00b6  29.  \nRegistered Agent  also says Corporation Service \u201cfollowed [its] email with multiple \ncalls to [ Registered Agent \u2019s] clients, verbally informing them that [ Registered Agent ] \ndoes not offer registered agent services.\u201d D.I. 20 \u00b6  31. But here Rule 9(b) makes a \ndifference: Registered Agent\u2019s bare assertion falls well below that  pleading standard . \nRegistered Agent  does not say when Corporation Service made the  calls or who re-\nceived them. T hat imprecision dooms Registered Agent \u2019s claim. See Kuhn Constr. Co. , \n844 F.  Supp.  2d at 530.  \n5. \u201c[Registered Agent  is] going out of business  soon.\u201d Finally, Registered Agent  \npleads that Corporation Service told \u201cmultiple [Registered Agent]  customers that \n[Registered Agent]  had been sold and was going out of business.\u201d D.I. 20 \u00b6 \u00b6 41\u201342. \nThis time it s allegation is precise  enough: it attaches emails from customers reporting \nwhen and to whom Corporation Service made its misleading phone calls. D.I. 20 -1, \nExs. 13\u201315.  \nYet the emails reveal that Corporation Service said that Registered Agent was  \n\u201cgoing out of business  soon.\u201d D.I. 20 -1, Ex. 13.  That is a prediction about the company\u2019s  \nfuture performance , not a misleading statement of fact. And other courts have con-\nsistently held that \u201c[p]redictions of future events are \u2026 nonactionable expressions of \nopinion\u201d under the Lanham Ac t. Eastman Chem. Co. v. Plastipure, Inc.,  775 F.3d 230, \n235 (5th Cir. 2014); see also Glob. Tech Led, LLC v. Hilumz Int\u2019l Corp., 2017 WL 11 588669, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 14, 2017) ( saying that a competitor is \u201cgoing out of busi-\nness\u201d is a \u201cnon- verifiable prediction of opinion about the future\u201d and so is \u201cnot action-\nable \u2026 under the Lanham Act.\u201d)  (internal quotation marks omitted) . That approach \nfits with the Third Circuit\u2019s direction that statements \u201cexpressed in broad [or] vague \nlanguage\u201d are not actionable. Ca strol Inc. v. Pennzoil Co ., 987 F.2d 939, 945 (3d Cir. \n1993).  \nIndeed, suppose  Registered Agent  showed that it had stable finances and concrete \nplans for future growth . That would not prove that it was not \u201cgoing out of business  \nsoon,\u201d just that it was unlikely to. Thus, it is not an actionable \u201cstatement [] of fact \ncapable of being proven false.\u201d Parker, 530 F. Supp. 2d at  679; see also 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1125(a)(1) (only \u201cfalse or misleading description [s]\u201d or representations \u201cof fact\u201d are \nactionable under the  Lanham Act).  Conversely, if Corporation Service had said that \nRegistered Agent was \u201c currently going out of business,\u201d or \u201c in the process of closing ,\u201d \nthose statements would be actionable.  \nBecause Registered Agent  fails to identify any false or misleading commercial ad-\nvertisement, I will dismiss its Lanham Act claims. But I  do so without prejudice  to \ngive it another chance  to state a claim .  \nIII. REGISTERED AGENT \u2019S CALIFORNIA UNFAIR -COMPETITION AND  \nFALSE -ADVERTISING CLAIMS FALL WITH ITS LANHAM ACT CLAIM S \nRegistered Agent  also alleges that Corporation Service\u2019s marketing campaign was \nan \u201cunlawful and unfair business practice\u201d that violated two provisions of California\u2019s \nUnfair Competition Law. D.I. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 65, 77.  12 One section bans  \u201cunlawful, unfair[,] or fraudulent business act[s] or practice[s] \nand unfair, deceptive, untrue[,] or misleading advertising.\u201d Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \n\u00a7\u00a7 17200, 17206 (Unfair Competition Law) . Another bars \u201cuntrue or misleading\u201d ad-\nvertising  \u201cwhich is known, or which by the exercise of  reasonable care sh ould be \nknown , to be true or misleading.\u201d Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17500 (False Advertising \nLaw) . \nTo state its unfair -competition  claim, Registered Agent  must identify an \u201cadver-\ntising claim [t hat is] is false or misleading.\u201d Nat\u2019l Council Against Health Fraud, Inc. \nv. King Bio Pharm., Inc. , 107 Cal. App. 4th 1336, 1342  (Cal. Ct. App. 2003). And be-\ncause unfair -competition and false- advertising claims are subject to Rule 9(b)\u2019s \nheighted pleading standard, Registered Agent  must plead those  claims specific ally. \nKearns v. Ford Motor Co ., 567 F.3d 1120, 1125 (9th Cir. 2009).  \nYet Registered Agent \u2019s California claims stumble over the same hurdles that \ndoomed  its Lanham Act claims.  See, e.g.,  Pacific Biosciences of Cal., Inc. v. Oxford \nNanopore Techs., Inc. , 2019 WL 668843, at *5 (D. Del. Feb. 19, 2019) ( because plain-\ntiff\u2019s Lahnham Act claim  fails, it s \u201cfalse advertising claim under California state law \n\u2026 must also be dismissed \u201d). \n\u2022 Two statements are not false or misleading: (1) Corporation Service\u2019s claim \nthat it had detected \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d in California;  and (2) Corporation \nService \u2019s claim that Lexitas did not offer registered- agent services.  \n\u2022 Another statement\u2014that Registered Agent  was \u201cgoing out of business  \nsoon\u201d\u2014is no t actionable. See City of San Francisco v. Purdue Pharma L.P ., 13 491 F. Supp. 3d 610, 693\u2013 94 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (\u201cCal ifornia treats \u2026 state-\nment [s] of opinion [] as inactionable.\u201d)  (internal quotation marks omitted) . \n\u2022 Corporation Service\u2019s statement that APAX funded Lexitas\u2019s acquisition of \nRegistered Agent  is not likely to deceive an \u201cordinary consumer acting rea-\nsonably under the circumstances.\u201d Stewart v. Kodiak Cakes, LLC , 537 F. \nSupp. 3d 1103, 1138 (S.D. Cal. 2021)  (quoting Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev ., \nN.A., 691 F.3d 1152, 1162 (9th Cir. 2012) ). Indeed, Corp oration Service\u2019s \nemail clarified  that Lexitas was the direct buyer . \n\u2022 Finally, Corporation Service\u2019s claim that Registered Agent  \u201chandle [s] [eve-\nrything ] online\u201d is not by itself  grounds for liability.  D.I. 20 \u00b6  15. Registered \nAgent never says w ho made these statements  or pleads enough facts to \nshow dissemination . So it flunks Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard.  \nThus, Registered Agent \u2019s California unfair -competition claims fail. But again , I \ndismiss them without prejudice  so Registered Agent  can try again .  \nIV. REGISTERED AGENT  DOES NOT PLEAD A CONTINUING INJURY TO ANCHOR ITS \nDELAWARE DECEPTIVE -TRADE -PRACTICES -ACT CLAIM  \nThe Delaware Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act bans  \u201cdisparag[ing]   the \ngoods, services, or business of another by false or misleading representation [s] of \nfact.\u201d Del. C ode Ann. tit. 6,  \u00a7 2532(a)(8). But the Act redresses ongoing practices, not \npast wrongs. So \u201crelief under the statute is dependent on [ Registered Agent \u2019s] enti-\ntlement to injunctive relief.\u201d Wright v. Portfolio Recovery Affiliates, 2011 WL 1226115, \nat *5 (D. Del. Mar. 30, 2011). To show that entitlement, Registered Agent  must plead \nfacts \u201cthat create a reasonable apprehension of a future wrong.\u201d State ex rel. Brady v. 14 Pettinaro Enters ., 870 A.2d 513, 536 (Del. Ch. 2005)  (quoting McMahon v. New Castle \nAssocs. , 532 A.2d 601, 606 (Del. Ch. 1987) ).  \nBut here , the alleged wrongdoing is  in the  past. Indeed , Registered Agent  asserts \nthat \u201c [Corporation Service] \u2019s marketing campaign has been directed to [its] custom-\ners,\u201d and that its campaign \u201c has taken its toll on [Registered Agent] \u2019s reputation.\u201d D.I. \n20 \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47 (emphases added). Plus, Registered Agent \u2019s amended complaint\u2014filed \nin July 2021\u2014expressly puts an end date on Corporation Service\u2019s conduct: \u201c[Corpo-\nration Service]  continued contacting [Registered Agent]  customers through March \n2021.\u201d Id. \u00b6 42. \nRegistered Agent  has not shown a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d that Corporation \nService\u2019s campaign is ongoing, so I dismiss its Deceptive Trade Practices Act claims \nwithout prejudice. If it adds allegations that Corpor ation Service is still misleading \nits customers, it may yet state a claim.  \nV. REGISTERED AGENT  FAILS TO STATE A TORT CLAIM  \nFinally, Registered Agent  brings common -law claims for interference with busi-\nness relations and unfair competition. Those two torts are \u201csimilar [].\u201d See Agilent \nTechs., Inc. v. Kirkland , 2009 WL 119865, at *5 (Del. Ch. Jan. 20, 2009). So I assess \nthem  together.  \nTo state a claim for interference of business relations, Registered Agent  must al-\nlege that Corporation Service intentionally interfered with its \u201creasonab[ly] \nprobab[le]\u201d business opportunities, causing it to lose money. Malpiede v. Townson , \n780 A.2d 1075, 1099 (Del. 2001). For its unfair -competition claim, it must plead that \nit had \u201ca reasonable expectancy of ent ering a valid business relationship, with which 15 [Corporation Service] wrongfully interfer[ed], \u2026 defeat[ing] [ Registered Agent \u2019s] le-\ngitimate expectancy and caus[ing] [it]  harm.\u201d Rypac Packaging Mach. Inc. v. Coakley , \n2000 WL 567895, at *8 (Del.  Ch. May 1, 2000).  \nThus, for both , Registered Agent  must identify a specific  business relationship or \nopportunity. Yet it does not . Vague assertions that \u201c [Registered Agent]  lost over 70 \nclients\u201d or \u201c[Registered Agent]  customers \u2026 switched to [Corporation Service] \u201d are \nnot enough. D.I. 20,  at 45\u201346. Cf. Agilent Techs, Inc. , 2009 WL 119865, at * 6 (allowing \nboth claims to proceed where a plaintiff \u201calleged four [specific] interactions between \n[defendant] and potential \u2026 customers\u201d).  \nSo I dismiss Registered A gent\u2019s tort claims without prejudice. It may yet identify \nspecific ventures  with which Corporation Service interfered.  \n* * * * * \nRegistered Agent  alleges that Corporation Service made false or misleading \nclaims about it . But its complaint does not support th ose allegation s. Many of Corpo-\nration Service\u2019s statements were true. Others were exaggerations or predictions about the future. Because Registered Agent  does not plead that Corporation Service \ncrossed the line, I dismiss all its claims without pr ejudice.  \n  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nREGISTERED  AGENT  SOLUTIONS,  \nINC.  \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nCORPORATION  SERVICE  COMPANY  \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:21- cv-786-SB \nORDER  \n1. I GRANT  Defendant\u2019 s Motion to Dismiss [D.I. 23] and DISMISS Registered \nAgent\u2019s claims without prejudice.  \n \nDated: March 28, 2022   ____________________________________ \n       UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n \n \n   \n"}
