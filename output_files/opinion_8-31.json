No. 08-031-LPS\nCiv. Act. No. 11-898-LPS\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, : Cr. Act. No. 09-036-LPS\nRespondent/Plaintiff.\nMEMORANDUM\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn March 31, 2009, Movant pled guilty to Count Sixteen of a thkty-six count Superseding\nIndictment. Count Sixteen charged him with production of child pornography in violation of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). (D.I. 47) Pursuant to the Plea Agreement, Movant also entered a guilty plea to a\none-count Information charging him with possession of child pomography, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2), as charged in Crirninal Action No. 09-36-LPS. (D.I. 47 in Cr. A. No.\n08-31; D.I. 3 in Cr. A. No. 09-36) On Febmary 10, 2009, the Honorable Joseph J. Faman, Jr.\nsentenced Movant to 360 months imprisonment on Count Sixteen of the Superseding Indictment in\nCr. A. No. 08-31, and to 120 months imprisonment on Count One of the Felony Information in Cr.\nA. No. 09-36, with the sentences to run concurrently with one another. (D.I. 65) The United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Thkd Circmt affirmed Movan^s convictions on October 7, 2010. See\nUnited States v. P'hillips, 396 F. App'x 831, 835 (3d Cir. 2010).\nIn 2011, Movant filed a pro se Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence Pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging several ineffective assistance of counsel claim. (D.I. 73) The Court\ndenied the \u00a7 2255 Motion as merifless on August 12, 2014. (D.I. 82; D.I. 83)\nOn July 16, 2015, Movant filed a new \u00a7 2255 Motion (\"Motion\"). (D.I. 84) Although notentirely clear, that Motion appears to assert that Movant's convictions and sentences are\nnnconstitutional because they violate United States v. Booker^ 543 U.S. 220 (2005), and the Ex Post\nFacto Clause. (D.I. 84 at 4) Movant argues that \"yon can't give 2 points for distribution just because\na peer to peer network was used,\" the use of the peer network \"doesn't prove he knowingPy]\nshared,\" and the \"2 counts occurred at different times.\" (D.I. 84 at 4)\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nPursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), a prisoner\ncannot ffle a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 without first seeking and receiving\napproval from the appropriate court of appeals. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (h); Rule 9, Rules Governing\nSection 2255 Proceedings, 28 U.S.C. foU. \u00a7 2255. A \u00a7 2255 motion is \"second or successive\" if it\nchallenges the same judgment as a prior 2255 motion. See United States v, Winkelman^ 746 F.3d 134,\n135 (3d Cir. 2014) (\"[W]e determine whether a petition is 'second or successive' by looking at the\njudgment challenged.\").\nIII. DISCUSSION\nThe instant Motion constitutes a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion for the gate-keeping\npurposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) because Movant's previous \u00a7 2255 motion was denied on the merits\nand the instant Motion attacks the same criminal judgment. The record does not contain any\nindication that Movant obtained an order from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals allowing this\nCourt to consider the pending \u00a7 2255 motion. Therefore, the Court will dismiss the instant Motion\nfor lack of jurisdiction. See Magvood v, Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 330-31 (2010). The Court will also\ndecline to issue a certificate of appealability because Movant has failed to make a \"substantial\nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2\n(2011); United States v, Ejer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997).IV. CONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, the Court concludes that Movant's \u00a7 2255 Motion constitutes an\nunauthori2ed second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Accordingly, the\nCourt wiJI dismiss Movant's \u00a7 2255 Motion for lack of jurisdiction. A separate Order will be\nentered.\niL/vFebruary 14, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\u2022RABLB HONORABLB LEONARD P.
