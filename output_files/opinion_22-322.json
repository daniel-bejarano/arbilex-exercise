No. 22-322-GBW\n\nUNITED STATES SECRETARY OF :\nTREASURY, :\n\nDefendant.\n\nPernell Stroman, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware,\nPro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nNovember , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nWILLIAMS, United States District Judge:\nL INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Pernell Stroman, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action on March 14, 2022. (D.I. 2) Plaintiff\nappears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. The\nCourt proceeds to review and screen the matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a).\n\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland vy. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d\nCir. 2008). Plaintiff filed his Complaint on a form designed for claims arising\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The pleading does not state a claim under \u00a7 2254 and\nmore properly arises as a civil rights claim.\n\nThe pleading is not a model of clarity. It does not contain any specific\nfacts. It refers to Plaintiffs criminal case, No. 0906011571, wherein he plead\nguilty of Murder 1, Burglary 1, and Possession of a Deadly Weapon during the\nCommission of a Felony. (D.I. 2 at 1) Plaintiff asks the Court to \u201cshow cause why\nthe case should not be dismissed.\u201d (/d. at 15?) He signs the pleading as \u201cI, the\ngrantor, hereby grant, convey, assign, discharge, settle, extinguish, pay such issues\n\nrequired to settle all liability of the defendant P. Lez Stroman\u201d and \u201cI hereby grant\nand convey such issues as to satisfy\u201d. (Jd.) Exhibits attached to the pleading\ninclude an affidavit that he is the third party intervenor and is claiming interest in\ncriminal case no. 0906011571; a statement that he is the real party in interest\nholding equitable title of the entire case, in the private; a number of documents\ndirected to the United States Secretary of Treasury, trustee, from Plaintiff. It may\nbe that the documents are intended to release any obligations, financial or\notherwise, of Plaintiff.\nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is\nfrivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or\nseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\nforma pauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks\nredress from a governmental defendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions\nbrought with respect to prison conditions). The Court must accept all factual\nallegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro\nse plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\n\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his\npleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded,\nmust be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d\nErickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). .\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard\nused when deciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184\nF.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to\ndismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can\nbe granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A,\n\nthe Court must grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment\n\n3\nwould be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at\n114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1)\n\ntake note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify\n\n4\nallegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the\nassumption of truth; and (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual\nallegations and then determine whether those allegations plausibly give rise to an\nentitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir.\n2016) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged\nwhen the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal,\n556 US. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is\nplausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw\non its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff names the United States Secretary of Treasury as a defendant.\n\u201cAbsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its\nagencies from suit.\u201d Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475\n(1994). Sovereign immunity also applies to claims against federal government\nofficials acting in their official capacity. Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166\u2014\n67 (1985); Robinson v. Overseas Military Sales Corp., 21 F.3d 502, 510 (2d Cir.\n1994). Sovereign immunity may be waived only if the government consents to\nsuit. Presidential Gardens Assocs. v. United States ex rel. Sec'y of Hous. and\n\nUrban Dev., 175 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 1999) (\u201cThe sovereign immunity of the\nUnited States may only be waived by federal statute.\u201d). A waiver of sovereign\nimmunity \u201ccannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.\u201d United States\nv. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399 (1976) (quoting United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4\n(1969)). \u201cThe doctrine of sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature, and\ntherefore to prevail, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that his claims\nfall within an applicable waiver.\u201d Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113\n(2d Cir. 2000) (internal citation omitted).\n\nPlaintiff must demonstrate his suit against Defendant falls within a valid\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. Plaintiff has not established any waiver of\nsovereign immunity permitting suit against Defendant. Accordingly, the claims\nagainst Defendant will be dismissed as frivolous. See Montero v. Travis, 171 F.3d\n757, 760 (2d Cir. 1999) (\u201cA complaint will be dismissed as frivolous when it is\nclear that the defendants are immune from suit.\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\nPlaintiff names a federal defendant and, therefore, the claim could be\nconstrued as a Bivens claim against Defendant in her official capacity. See Bivens\nv. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388\n(1971). Federal courts recognize a cause of action for damages against federal\n\nofficers acting in their individual capacities who are alleged to have violated a\n\n6\ncitizen\u2019s constitutional rights. Bivens, 403 U.S. 388, 397 (1971). Bivens provides a\ndamages remedy for constitutional violations committed by federal actors in very\nlimited circumstances. Egbert v. Boule, U.S._, _S. Ct.__, 2022 WL 2056291,\nat *3 (U.S. June 8, 2022); Ziglar v. Abbasi, _U.S.__, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1854\n(2017). The Supreme Court has recognized an implied private action against\nfederal officials in three cases, as follows: (1) Bivens itself, which recognized an\nimplied cause of action for violation of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s right against\nunreasonable searches and seizures; (2) Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979),\nwhich recognized a claim for gender discrimination in the employment context\nunder the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause; and (3) Carlson v. Green, 446\nU.S. 14 (1980), which recognized a claim against prison officials for inadequate\nmedical care in the prison context under the Eighth Amendment. See Dongarra v.\nSmith, 27 F.4th 174, 180 (3d Cir. 2022); see also Abbasi, _U.S.__, 137. Ct. at\n1855 (\u201cThese three cases - Bivens, Davis, and Carlson - represent the only\ninstances in which the [Supreme] Court has approved of an implied damages\nremedy under the Constitution itself.\u201d). Plaintiff's allegations and exhibits do not\nstate claims under any of the three recognized Bivens claims, and any claims\n\nPlaintiff sought to raise will be dismissed.\nWhile doubtful, it is possible that Plaintiff intended to raise claims under the\nFederal Torts Claim Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). The FTCA waives the United States\u2019\nsovereign immunity for claims sounding in state tort law for money damages. 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2674 (waiving sovereign immunity to make the United States liable \u201cin\nthe same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like\ncircumstances\u201d); Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 700 (2004) (\u201cThe FTCA\n\u2018was designed primarily to remove the sovereign immunity of the United States\nfrom suits in tort, with certain specific exceptions.\u2019\u201d [quoting Richards v. United\nStates, 369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962)]); White-Squire v. U.S. Postal Serv., 592 F.3d 453,\n456-57 (3d Cir. 2010). This waiver of immunity is subject to certain limitations\nand jurisdictional requirements. First, the United States is the only proper\ndefendant in an FTCA action. See CNA v. United States, 535 F.3d 132, 138 n.2\n(3d Cir. 2008). Second, a plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies as a\nprerequisite to filing a lawsuit under the FTCA. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). In other\nwords, \u201c[n]o claim can be brought under the FTCA unless the plaintiff first\npresents the claim to the appropriate federal agency and the agency renders a final\ndecision on the claim.\u201d Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 569 (3d Cir. 2015)\n\n(stating that exhaustion is \u201cjurisdictional and cannot be waived\u201d).\nThe Complaint does not name the United States as a defendant, and it does\nnot plead any facts that speak to administrative exhaustion. Therefore, to the\nextent Plaintiff intended to raise an FTCA, the case will be dismissed.\n\nFinally, even had Plaintiff named the proper defendant for a Bivens or\nFTCA claim, the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a plausible\nclaim. Based upon a review of Plaintiff's submissions, the Court concludes the\nclaims are frivolous and that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief\ncan be granted.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint pursuant 28\n\nUSS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) and 1915A(b)(1). Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nPERNELL STROMAN,\nPlaintiff,\nVv. : Civ.
