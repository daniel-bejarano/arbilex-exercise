Civ. No. 21-1247, D.I. 27; Civ. \nNo. 21-1362, D.I. 21; Civ. No. 21-1855, D.I. 22; Civ. No. 22-413, D.I. 18.1 The \nFederal Circuit stayed the Memorandum Order \"pending further action\" and \ndirected Defendants to respond to the petition no later than November 30. \nI issued the Memorandum Order sua sponte. The Memorandum Order \ndirects Nimitz and its counsel to produce certain records to the Court. I stated in \nthe Memorandum Order's first paragraph that I was ordering the production of \nthese records because \"the testimony of witnesses and representations of counsel \nat\" a hearing I held on November 4 had \"give[n] rise to concerns that include but \nare not limited to the accuracy of statements in filings made by [Nimitz] with the \nCourt and whether the real parties in interest are before the Court[.]\" D.I. 27 at 1. \nI had previously stated in the order that scheduled the November 4 hearing that I \nhad \"concerns about whether Plaintiff has complied with the Court's standing \norder regarding third-party litigation funding.\" D.I. 24 at 2. And I stated at the \nconclusion of the November 4 hearing that I thought the testimony adduced at the \n1 Unless otherwise noted, all docket citations that follow will be to Civ. No. 21-\n1247. Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 3 of 80 PageID #: 516hearing gave rise to concerns about the abuse of our courts and the \"lack of \ntransparency as to who the real parties before the Court are, about who is making \ndecisions in these types oflitigation.\" D.I. 26 at 107:17-19. I also made very \nclear during the hearing-in the presence ofNimitz's counsel, George Pazuniak, \nand its owner, Mark Hall-that I had serious concerns that counsel had violated the \nRules of Professional Conduct. I purposely did not repeat in the Memorandum \nOrder my concerns about counsel's professionalism and potential role in the abuse \nof the Court because I have made no definitive conclusions about those issues, and \nI did not want to unnecessarily embarrass counsel; the Order's \"include but are not \nlimited to\" wording was intentional. But in light of the Federal Circuit's stay order \nand the fact that I issued the Memorandum Order to protect important interests of \nthis Court and not at Defendants' request, I think it prudent to explain more \nfulsomely and in writing the reasons I issued the Memorandum Order. \nI. \nThe road to the Memorandum Order begins with Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 7 .1. That rule requires any \"nongovernmental corporate party\" to file \n\"with its first appearance, pleading, petition, motion, response, or other request \naddressed to the court\" \"a disclosure statement that: (1) identifies any parent \ncorporation and any publicly held corporation owning 10% or more of its stock; or \n2 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 4 of 80 PageID #: 517(2) states that there is no such corporation.\" The Advisory Committee Notes to the \nRule explain its main purpose: \nThe information required [ to be disclosed] by Rule 7 .1 (a) \nreflects the \"financial interest\" standard of Canon \n3C(l)(c) of the Code of Conduct for United States \nJudges. This information will support properly informed \ndisqualification decisions in situations that call for \nautomatic disqualification under Canon 3C(l)(c). \nFED. R. CIV. P. 7.1 advisory committee's notes to 2002 amendment. \nThe Advisory Committee recognized that Rule 7.1 \"does not cover all of the \ncircumstances that may call for disqualification under the financial interest \nstandard, and does not deal at all with other circumstances that may call for \ndisqualification.\" Id. For those reasons, the Committee explained in its Notes that \n\"Rule 7 .1 does not prohibit local rules that require disclosures in addition to those \nrequired by Rule 7.1\" and also that \" [ d]eveloping experience with local disclosure \npractices ... may provide a foundation for adopting more detailed disclosure \nrequirements by future amendments of Rule 7.1.\" Id. \nThese comments informed my decision to issue on April 18, 2022, a \nStanding Order Regarding Disclosure Statements Required by Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 7.1 (the Disclosure Order). See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(6) \n( authorizing judges to \"regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, \nrules adopted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2072 and 2075, and the district's local rules\"). \n3 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 5 of 80 PageID #: 518That Order applies to all civil cases-not just patent cases-assigned to me and \nrequires any \"party [that] is a nongovernmental joint venture, limited liability \ncorporation, partnership, or limited liability partnership, ... [to] include in its \ndisclosure statement filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7.1 the name \nof every owner, member, and partner of the party, proceeding up the chain of \nownership until the name of every individual and corporation with a direct or \nindirect interest in the party has been identified.\" Disclosure Order at 1. \nI am not the only district court judge in the country who requires disclosures \nbeyond what Rule 7.1 requires. See, e.g, C.D. Cal. R. 7.1-1; N.D. Cal. Civil L.R. \n3-15; N.D. Ga. Civ. R. 3.3; S.D. Ga. L.R. 7.1.1; N.D. & S.D. Iowa Civ. R. 7.1; D. \nMd. L.R. 103.3(b); E.D. Mich. L.R. 83.4; D. Nev. L.R. 7.1-1; E.D.N.C. Civ. R. \n7.3; N.D. Ohio L.R. 3.13(b); S.D. Ohio Civ. R. 7.1.1; N.D. Tex. L.R. 3.l(c); W.D. \nTex. Civ. R. 33. It makes sense that other courts would have these additional \ndisclosure requirements, as it is critically important that federal judges do not \nsuffer from conflicts that could call into question their impartiality. As Justice \nHolmes noted: \nIt is desirable that the trial of causes should take place \nunder the public eye, not because the controversies of \none citizen with another are of public concern, but \nbecause it is of the highest moment that those who \nadminister justice should always act under the sense of \npublic responsibility, and that every citizen should be \n4 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 6 of 80 PageID #: 519able to satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the mode \nin which a public duty is performed. \nCowley v. Pulsifer, 137 Mass. 392, 394 (1884) (Holmes, J.). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n4 5 5 (a) ( requiring federal judges to disqualify themselves \"in any proceeding in \nwhich [their] impartiality might reasonably be questioned\");\u00a7 455(b) (requiring \nfederal judges to disqualify themselves where they have any \"interest that could be \nsubstantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding\"). \nThe Disclosure Order also promotes the identification of the real parties in \ninterest in a case. \"[O]ne of the essential qualities of a Court of Justice [is] that its \nproceedings should be public.\" Doe v. Megless, 654 F.3d 404,408 (3d Cir. 2011) \n(quoting Daubney v. Cooper, 109 Eng. Rep. 438,441 (K.B. 1829) and citing Nixon \nv. Warner Cmmc 'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598-99 (1978)) (alterations in original). \n\"Identifying the parties to the proceeding is an important dimension of publicness. \nThe people have a right to know who is using their courts.\" Doe v. Blue Cross & \nBlue Shield United of Wis., 112 F.3d 869, 872 (7th Cir. 1997) (Posner, J.); see also \nFED. R. Crv. P. 17(a) (\"An action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party \nin interest.\"). Federal courts are not star chambers.2 \n2 The Disclosure Order has the added benefit of ensuring that subject matter \njurisdiction is present in diversity jurisdiction cases involving LLCs, whose \ncitizenship is based on the citizenship of its individual members. See Lincoln \n5 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 7 of 80 PageID #: 520To promote additional transparency in this Court's proceedings, I also issued \non April 18, 2022, a Standing Order Regarding Third-Party Funding Arrangements \n(the Third-Party Funding Order). That Order, which also applies to all civil cases \nassigned to me, provides in relevant part: \n... [W]here a party has made arrangements to receive \nfrom a person or entity that is not a party (a \"Third-Party \nFunder\") funding for some or all of the party's attorney \nfees and/or expenses to litigate this action on a non\u00ad\nrecourse basis in exchange for ( 1) a financial interest that \nis contingent upon the results of the litigation or (2) a \nnon-monetary result that is not in the nature of a personal \nloan, bank loan, or insurance: \n1. Within the later of 45 days of this Order or 3 0 days \nof the filing of an initial pleading or transfer of the matter \nto this District, including the removal of a state action, \nthe party receiving such funding shall file a statement \n(separate from any pleading) containing the following \ninformation: \na. The identity, address, and, if a legal entity, \nplace of formation of the Third-Party Funder(s); \nb. Whether any Third-Party Funder's approval \nis necessary for litigation or settlement decisions in the \nBenefit Life Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, 800 F.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir. 2015) (\"[T]he \ncitizenship of an LLC is determined by the citizenship of [ each of] its members.\" \n(quoting Zambelli Fireworks Mfg. Co. v. Wood, 592 F.3d 412,418 (3d Cir. \n2010))). To that end, the Disclosure Order acts in concert with my April 18, 2022 \nStanding Order Regarding Disclosure of Citizenship of Organizational Entities in \nDiversity Cases. \"Courts have long used the disclosure statement occasioned by \n[Rule 7 .1] as a means of discerning the citizenship of corporate entities for \npurposes [of] diversity jurisdiction.\" 5 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHURR. \nMILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE\u00a7 1198 (4th ed.) (internal footnote \nand citations omitted). \n6 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 8 of 80 PageID #: 521action, and if the answer is in the affirmative, the nature \nof the terms and conditions relating to that approval; and \nc. A brief description of the nature of the \nfinancial interest of the Third-Party Funder( s ). \nThird-Party Funding Order at 1-2. Although the Third-Party Funding Order \nrequires the filing of a statement if third-party litigation funding exists in a case, it \ndoes not require the filing of a negative statement that no third-party litigation \nfunding exists. \nI modeled the Third-Party Funding Order on Local Civil Rule 7 .1.1 of the \nDistrict of New Jersey's Local Rules. That rule was issued on June 21, 2021. The \nJudicial Conference of the Third Circuit has neither modified nor abrogated the \nRule and therefore, by statute, the Rule remains in effect. See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 207l(c)(l)-(2); see also D.N.J. L. Civ. R. 83.1. Like the District ofNew Jersey, \nthis Court is part of the Third Circuit; thus, I was (and am) confident about the \nappropriateness of the Third-Party Funding Order. My confidence is reinforced by \nthe fact that as of 2018, six federal courts of appeals and 24 district courts had \nthird-party funding disclosure requirements of some kind. See MEETING OF THE \nADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CML RULES AGENDA BOOK 209, 210 Philadelphia, P.A. \n(Apr. 10, 2018) (reporting survey results showing that \"[s]ix U.S. Courts of \nAppeals have local rules which require identifying litigation funders\" and that \"of \nthe 94 federal district courts in the United States, 24-or roughly 25% of all U.S. \n7 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 9 of 80 PageID #: 522District Courts-require disclosure of the identity of litigation funders in a civil \ncase\"). \nII. \nNimitz filed these four patent cases and seven others in this Court between \nAugust 30, 2021 and March 30, 2022.3 It asserted in all 11 cases a single patent: \nU.S. Patent No. 7,848,328 (the #328 patent). Mr. Pazuniak has been Nimitz's \nattorney of record in each case. Nimitz voluntarily dismissed the seven other cases \nbetween December 2021 and April 2022. 4 \nOn May 9, 2022, I held an oral argument on motions to dismiss filed in three \nof the four cases at issue here: Civ. Nos. 21-1247, 21-1362, and 21-1855. On May \n13, 2022, my chambers discovered that Nimitz's Rule 7 .1 disclosure statement in \n3 The seven other cases were: Nimitz Techs. LLC v. Bleacher Rep., Inc., Civ. No. \n21-1246; Nimitz Techs. LLC v. Pinterest, Inc., Civ. No. 21-1248; Nimitz Techs. \nLLC v. Reddit, Inc., Civ. No. 21-1249; Nimitz Techs. LLC v. Conde Nast Ent. LLC, \nCiv. No. 21-1360; Nimitz Techs. LLC v. Skillshare, Inc., Civ. No. 21-1363; Nimitz \nTechs. LLC v. Twitter, Inc., Civ. No. 21-1364; Nimitz Techs. LLC v. Tastemade, \nInc., Civ. No. 21-1856; and Nimitz Techs. LLC v. Bloomberg L.P., Civ. No. 22-\n413. \n4 Civ. No. 21-1246, D.I. 10 (December 14, 2021); Civ. No. 21-1364, D.I. 8 \n(December 14, 2021); Civ. No. 21-1248, D.I. 10 (December 20, 2021); Civ. No. \n21-1249, D.I. 11 (December 22, 2021); Civ. No. 21-1360, D.I. 10 (February 4, \n2022); Civ. No. 21-1363, D.I. 15 (April 27, 2022); Civ. No. 21-1856, D.I. 8 (April \n27, 2022). \n8 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 10 of 80 PageID #: 523the 21-1247 action did not identify any owner or member of Nimitz. Accordingly, \nI had the following oral order docketed that day: \nThe parties are directed to certify within five days that \nthey have complied with [the] April 18, 2022 Standing \nOrder Regarding Disclosure Statements Required by \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 7.1. The parties are also \nreminded of their obligation to comply with [the] April \n18, 2022 Standing Order Regarding Third-Party Funding \nArrangements. \nMay 13, 2022 Oral Order. \nOn May 18, 2022, CNET, the defendant in the 21-1247 action, filed an \namended disclosure statement in response to the May 13 order. D.I. 19. On May \n23, having received no response to the May 13 order from Nimitz, I issued an order \nto show cause why Nimitz should not be held in contempt for failing to comply \nwith the May 13 order. D.I. 20. \nTwo days later, on May 25, Nimitz filed in the 21-1247 action an amended \nRule 7.1 disclosure statement in which it stated that \"[t]he sole owner and member \nof Nimitz Technologies LLC is Mark Hall, an individual.\" D.I. 21 at 1. Nimitz \nmade this same representation in three Rule 7 .1 disclosure statements it filed that \nsame day in the other three actions at issue here. (It turns out that Nimitz had \nnever filed Rule 7 .1 disclosure statements in these three cases; nor did it ever file a \n9 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 11 of 80 PageID #: 524Rule 7.1 disclosure statement in four of the other seven cases. See Civ Nos. 21-\n1360, 21-1363, 21-1364, and 21-1856.) \nNimitz also filed in all four cases on May 25 responses to the Third-Party \nFunding Order in which it represented that \"Plaintiff has not entered into any \narrangement with a Third-Party Funder, as defined in the Court's Standing Order \nRegarding Third Party Litigation Funding Arrangements.\" Civ. No. 21-1247, D.I. \n22; Civ. No. 21-1362, D.I. 17; Civ. No. 21-1855, D.I. 18; Civ. No. 22-413, D.I. 12. \nIn the meantime, I turned my attention to other matters. \nIII. \nOn July 13, 2022, I held oral argument on a motion to dismiss filed in \nLongbeam Technologies LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., Civ. No. 21-1559, a case I had \nno reason to believe at the time was related to Nimitz's cases. Mr. Pazuniak was \nnot counsel of record for Long beam, and he did not attend the July 13 hearing. \nAt the outset of the hearing, I told Longbeam's counsel that a \"Supplement\" \nLong beam had filed to amend its Rule 7 .1 disclosure statement did not comply \nwith the Disclosure Order because the Supplement identified Longbeam as \nLongbeam's owner. Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 37 at 3:19-4:2. That observation led \nto the following colloquy: \n[Longbeam's Counsel]: With Your Honor's permission, \nimmediately following the hearing, I would be glad to \n10 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 12 of 80 PageID #: 525contact my office and update [the supplement Rule 7.1 \ndisclosure statement] to the extent it's necessary or call \nback into your chambers. \nTHE COURT: Well, ... don't call back in. This has to \nbe on the record. Who is Long beam? Who are the \nmembers ofLongbeam Technologies, LLC? \n[Longbeam's Counsel]: I do not know. \nTHE COURT: The defendants have no reaction to this \nstatement[?] \n[Amazon's Counsel]: No, Your Honor. We're not sure \neither. \nTHE COURT: Didn't raise any objections to it? \n[Amazon's Counsel]: No. We did not, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Don't you want to know who's suing \nyou? \n[Amazon's Counsel]: I think that would be helpful, yes, \nYour Honor. \nCiv. No. 21-1559, D.I. 37 at 4:14-5:6. I then gave Longbeam a week to again \namend its Rule 7 .1 disclosure statement. \nOn July 20, Longbeam filed an Amended Rule 7.1 Disclosure Statement, in \nwhich it represented that its \"sole owner and only member is Sharon Bullion.\" \nCiv. No. 21-1559, D.I. 30 at 1. It also filed that day an Amended Statement \nRegarding Third-Party Funding in which it stated that \"Longbeam has not entered \n11 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 13 of 80 PageID #: 526into any funding arrangement or agreement for the payment of attorneys' fees in \nthis case other than, to the extent applicable, its retainer agreement with outside \ncounsel of record, Daignault Iyer LLP.\" Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 31 at 1. \nOn July 25, Amazon filed an objection to Longbeam's amended disclosure \nand third-party funding statements. Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 33. Amazon faulted \nthe statements \"for their failure to disclose Longbeam's apparent relationship with \npatent monetization entity IP Edge.\" Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 33 at 1. In Amazon's \nwords: \nLongbeam's disclosures make no mention of IP Edge, \nbut its own administrative filings, as well as public \nreporting, confirm that Longbeam is an extension of IP \nEdge. Longbeam's patent assignment, excerpted and \nrecorded with the United States Patent and Trademark \nOffice, confirms that the correspondence address for \nLongbeam is an \"@ip-edge.com\" email address. \nIndependent news reports have confirmed that \"IP Edge \nhas continued to form additional entities ... among them \n... Longbeam Technologies LLC\" and that this litigation \nspecifically represents \"a brand-new campaign run by IP \nEdge.\" The latter is notable given that a principal of IP \nEdge is a contributor to the same media outlet. \nLongbeam's failure to disclose its connection to IP Edge \nis concerning, given IP Edge's established practice of \n\"the naming of individuals, seemingly with no prior \nconnection to monetization, as managers or members of \nits various LLCs\" to avoid disclosure of its real interests, \nin defiance of the purpose of this Court's standing \ndisclosure orders. As the Court noted, this structure \nprevents Amazon from having any understanding of who \n12 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 14 of 80 PageID #: 527is actually suing it, and who is making strategic litigation \ndecisions for Longbeam. \nCiv. No. 21-1559, D.I. 33 at 1-2 (citations and alterations omitted). \nAmazon attached to its objection two exhibits that bear on the Memorandum \nOrder. The first is an assignment of the patents asserted by Longbeam against \nAmazon that was recorded in the United States Patent and Trademark Office \n(PTO) on October 29, 2021-three days before Longbeam filed its lawsuit in this \nCourt. Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 34-1, Ex. A. Longbeam is identified in the \nassignment as the assignee. Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 34-1 at 2. Sharon Bullion \nsigned the assignment on Longbeam's behalf and is identified in the assignment as \nLongbeam's managing member. She is also identified as the \"submitter\" of the \npatent assignment to the PTO. Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 34-1 at 2. The email \naddress provided for the submitter is linhd@ip-edge.com. Civ. No. 21-1559, \nD.I. 34-1 at 2. \nThe second exhibit is a May 22, 2022 article titled \"Plaintiff Newly \nAssigned to Judge Connolly's Courtroom Amends Its Prior Disclosure\" that \nappears to have been published by RPX Corporation. Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 34-1, \nEx. E. Noteworthy here is the fact that the article identifies Mark Hall, Sally \nPugal, and Lori LaPray each as a managing member of different LLCs that had \nbeen assigned IP Edge-related patents. Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 34-1 at 28. \n13 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 15 of 80 PageID #: 528According to the article, each of the LLCs was \"formed just prior\" to transfers of \npatents to the LLCs, after which each LLC \"launched a litigation campaign over its \nreceived assets.\" Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 34-1 at 28. \nAmazon argued in its objection that \"Longbeam's obfuscation prevent[ed] \nAmazon from meaningfully assessing whether Longbeam has standing to bring \nthis action\"; and it asked me to order \"early discovery limited to this threshold \nissue of standing, including the production of relevant documents and a deposition \nofLongbeam principals on the nature and extent of IP Edge's interests in this \nlitigation and the asserted patents, while staying discovery on other issues.\" Civ. \nNo. 21-1559, D.I. 33 at 2-3. \nLongbeam argued in a response to Amazon's objection that the recordation \nat the PTO of the assignment to Long beam of the patents it had asserted against \nAmazon \"provide[ d] conclusive evidence that Plaintiff Longbeam has standing to \nbring this action.\" Civ. No. 21-1559, D.I. 36 at 1. Notably, nowhere in its \nresponse did Longbeam deny Amazon's assertions that Longbeam was simply \"an \nextension of IP Edge,\" that IP Edge forms entities like and including Longbeam as \npart of a litigation campaign, and that IP Edge engages in a practice of naming \nindividuals with no prior connection to patent monetization as managers or \nmembers of its various LLCs to avoid disclosure of its real interests in defiance of \n14 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 16 of 80 PageID #: 529the purpose of the Disclosure and Third-Party Funding Orders. Nor did Longbeam \nchallenge in any way the accuracy of the RPX Corporation article. \nOn August 1 7, I docketed an oral order granting Amazon's discovery and \nstay requests based on \"concerns about Longbeam's standing to pursue this action \nand whether it has complied with the Court's standing order regarding third-party \nlitigation funding arrangements.\" Civ. No. 21-1559, Aug. 17, 2022 Oral Order. I \nthen moved on to other matters. \nIV. \nOn August 25, I turned my attention to a motion filed by Jimmy Chong, \nEsquire, to withdraw as counsel for Missed Call, LLC in three patent cases: Missed \nCall, LLCv. Freshworks, Inc., Civ. No. 22-739; Missed Call, LLCv. Talkdesk, \nInc., Civ. No. 22-740; and Missed Call, LLCv. Twilioinc., Civ. No. 22-742. I had \nno reason at the time to believe the Missed Call cases were related in any way to \nthe Nimitz cases. I would soon learn otherwise. \nMr. Chong has been a prolific filer of patent cases in our court. According \nto our CM/ECF records, he has filed more than 770 patent cases in this district \nsince January 1, 2019. \nThe motion in question, signed by Mr. Chong, was not your typical \nwithdrawal motion: \n15 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 17 of 80 PageID #: 530... Plaintiff Missed Call, LLC, by and through its \nundersigned counsel, respectfully request[ s] to the \nwithdrawal of counsel of Jimmy Chong, Esq[.], from the \nChong Law Firm, P.A. for Plaintiff Missed Call, LLC in \nthe above-captioned matters. The Plaintiff will continue \nto be represented by out-of-state counsel, William P. \nRamey, III, Esquire, from the Ramey LLP and out-of\u00ad\nstate counsel's firm is presently seeking new Delaware \nLocal Counsel. Out[-]ofI-]state counsel initially stated \nthat multiple firms are able to act as local counsel; \nhowever, no firm has been presented as new Delaware \nCounsel to date. Good cause exists for the withdrawal as \ncounsel, in that attorney is unable to effectively \ncommunicate with Client in a manner consistent with \ngood attorney-client relations. Withdrawal can be \naccomplished without material adverse effect on the \ninterests of Plaintiff. There is no objection to the \nwithdrawal by the Ramey LLP. \nThe Plaintiff has been forwarded a copy of this \nMotion[.] \nCiv. No. 22-739, D.I. 16 at 1-2; Civ. No. 22-740, D.I. 12 at 1-2; Civ. No. 22-742, \nD.I. 9 at 1-2. \nThe motion presented an immediate problem. Mr. Ramey had been admitted \npro hac vice in the Missed Call cases. But under Local Rule 83 .5( d) he could not \ncontinue to \"be admitted pro hac vice in this Court unless [he was] associated with \nan attorney who is a member of the Bar of this Court and who maintains an office \nin the District of Delaware for the regular transaction of business.\" Furthermore, \nRule 83 .5( d) requires that all filings be made by Delaware counsel. Thus, unless \n16 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 18 of 80 PageID #: 531and until another Delaware lawyer entered an appearance on behalf of Missed Call, \nI did not see how I could grant Missed Call's motion to withdraw Mr. Chong as its \ncounsel. The cryptic language in one sentence of the motion-\"[g]ood cause exists \nfor the withdrawal as counsel, in that attorney is unable to effectively communicate \nwith Client in a manner consistent with good attorney-client relations\"-also \nraised alarm bells. Accordingly, I issued an order on the afternoon of August 25 \nsetting a hearing on the withdrawal motion for September 1. I expressly stated in \nthe August 25 order that both Mr. Chong and Mr. Ramey were required to attend \nthe hearing in person. \nBy the time September 1 came around, Mr. Chong had filed motions to \nwithdraw in 15 patent cases in which he acted as Delaware counsel for an LLC that \nwas also represented by Mr. Ramey.5 Six of those cases (including the three \nMissed Call cases) were assigned to me. In none of the six cases assigned to me \n5 See Civ. No. 22-739, D.I. 16; Civ. No. 22-740, D.I. 12; Civ. No. 22-742, D.I. 9; \nWireless Discovery LLC v. Coffee Meets Bagel, Inc., Civ.

And in none of those cases \nhad the Plaintiff filed a third-party funding disclosure statement. \nMr. Ramey chose not to appear at the September 1 hearing. (At a later \nhearing, I found that Mr. Ramey's willful disregard of the August 25 order \nwarranted sanctions.) Mr. Chong did appear. Two issues arose at the hearing that \nbear on the Memorandum Order. \nFirst, Mr. Chong admitted at the hearing that Missed Call and other LLCs \nthat he and Mr. Ramey represented in cases assigned to me had failed to comply \nwith the Disclosure Order. Early in the hearing Mr. Chong appeared to fault Mr. \nRamey for this failure: \nTHE COURT: Do you know you are not in compliance, \nin many of these cases with Mr. Ramey, [you].have not \ncomplied with my standing orders; do you know that? \nMR. CHONG: And-\nTHE COURT: Do you know that? \nMR. CHONG: Yes, Your Honor. Those are some of the \nissues that we have been running into that there's some \nthings that I cannot do without cooperation from Mr. \nRamey's office, and that is really the most-some of the \nmost difficult things I'm running into. \nCiv. No. 22-739, D.I. 33 at 4:20-5:5. \n18 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 20 of 80 PageID #: 533But later in the hearing, Mr. Chong appeared to accept sole responsibility for \nhis clients' failure to comply with the Disclosure Order: \nTHE COURT: Have you asked for-I'm not asking \nwho. I'm asking these questions very intentionally. \nHave you asked for information that would enable you to \ndisclose to the Court who the members of Missed Call, \nLLC are? \nMR. CHONG: I have not specifically asked that to \ndisclose to the Court specifically. \nTHE COURT: You know you are required to disclose to \nthe Court, right, who the members of Missed Call, LLC \nare, right? \nMR. CHONG: Yes. \nTHE COURT: That's not disputed, right? \nMR. CHONG: Correct. \nTHE COURT: That's the standing order? \nMR. CHONG: Correct. \nTHE COURT: Have you asked for that information, so \nthat you can fulfill your obligation to comply with the \nstanding order? \nMR. CHONG: Yes. \nTHE COURT: So you have asked for that information? \nMR. CHONG: Yes. \n19 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 21 of 80 PageID #: 534THE COURT: Presumably you've either asked Mr. \nRamey or the client for that information? \nMR. CHONG: Yes. \nTHE COURT: Okay. Have you received that \ninformation? \nMR. CHONG: Yes. \n* * * * \nTHE COURT: When did you obtain information about \nthe membership of Missed Call, LLC? \nMR. CHONG: I don't have the exact date. I've known it \nfor some time, Your Honor. \n* * * * \nTHE COURT: So I'm trying to figure out: Why if you \nknow or have been told who are the members of the \nLLC, why you haven't complied with the Court order? \nMR. CHONG: I don't have-\nTHE COURT: Has Mr. Ramey ever suggested to you \nthat you should put off disclosing the identity of any \nmembers of an LLC? \nMR. CHONG: No, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: So if it turns out that in a number of cases \nwith Mr. Ramey, there is a complete failure to comply \nwith the disclosure order, that's on you; is that what you \nare saying? \nMR. CHONG: That would be on me, Your Honor, yes. \nThat would be. \nCiv. No. 22-739, D.I. 33 at 21:13-22:16, 23:12-15, 24:3-16. \n20 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 22 of 80 PageID #: 535Second, Mr. Chong unequivocally identified Carlos Gorrichategui as the \nowner of Missed Call: \nTHE COURT: . . . Describe for me Missed Call. \nMR. CHONG: Describe for you? \nTHE COURT: Missed Call. \nMR. CHONG: So I have a lot of cases, and I do admit I \ndon't know the details offhand right now. I know the \nowner. I've spoken with him. \nTHE COURT: So who is the owner of Missed Call[]? \nMR. CHONG: Carlos G-U-I-I don't have his\u00ad\nGorrichategui. I represented him in other cases, Your \nHonor. \n* * * * \nTHE COURT: And you say you're unable to effectively \ncommunicate with the client in a manner consistent with \ngood attorney-client relations. That client in this case is \nMissed Call? \nMR. CHONG: Yes. \nTHE COURT: You don't know who the client is sounds \nlike or do you? \nMR. CHONG: Carlos. \nTHE COURT: Carlos is also Missed Call? \nMR. CHONG: Yes. \nCiv. No. 22-739, D.I. 33 at 16:11-21, 20:20-21:4. \n21 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 23 of 80 PageID #: 536V. \nThe day after the Missed Call hearing, September 2, Mr. Chong filed 11 \nam.ended Rule 7.1 disclosures in five different sets of related patent cases. Four \nsets of those related cases bear directly on the Memorandum. Order. \nFirst, in the three Missed Call cases, and notwithstanding Mr. Chong's \nrepresentations to the Court the day before that Missed Call was owned by Carlos \nGorrichategui, Mr. Chong filed in the 22-740 Missed Call action an am.ended \ndisclosure statement in which Missed Call represented that it was \"owned 100% by \nPueblo Neuvo, LLC (Hernan Perec owns 100% of Pueblo Nuevo, LLC).O. \nGorrichategui. [sic]\" Civ. No. 22-740, D.I. 15 at 1. Mr. Chong filed that same day \nin the 22-739 and 22-742 Missed Call actions am.ended statements that were \nidentical to the 22-740 am.ended statement except that they deleted \"O. \nGorrichategui.\" Civ. No. 22-739, D.I. 19 at 1; Civ. No. 22-742, D.I. 13 at 1. The \ncom.plaints in all three cases had been filed on June 6, 2022 and alleged \ninfringement of the same patent: U.S. Patent No. 9,531,872. \nSecond, in two related cases brought by Lam.plight Licensing LLC, Mr. \nChong filed am.ended Rule 7 .1 disclosure statements in which Lam.plight \nrepresented that \"its sole owner and managing partner [sic] is Sally Pugal.\" \nLamplight Licensing LLC v. ABB Inc., Civ. No. 22-418, D.I. 12 at 1; Lamplight \n22 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 24 of 80 PageID #: 537Licensing LLC v. Ingram Micro, Inc., Civ. No. 22-1017, D.I. 8 at 1. Lamplight had \nasserted in these two cases and in four other related cases filed by Mr. Chong \nbeginning in November 2021 the same patent: U.S. Patent No. 9,716,393. The \nfour other cases were voluntarily dismissed before September 2. 6 \nThird, in two cases brought by Mellaconic IP, LLC, Mr. Chong filed \namended disclosure statements in which Mellaconic represented that \"its sole \nowner and managing partner [sic] is Hau Bui.\" Mellaconic IP LLC v. TimeClock \nPlus, LLC, Civ. No. 22-244, D.I. 14 at 1; Mellaconic IP LLC v. Deputy, Inc., Civ. \nNo. 22-541, D.I. 8 at 1. Mellaconic had asserted in these cases and in 17 related \ncases filed by Mr. Chong beginning in September 2020 the same patent: U.S. \nPatent No. 9,986,435. The 17 other cases were voluntarily dismissed before \nSeptember 2.7 \n6 See Lamplight Licensing, LLC v. CyberPower Sys., Inc., Civ. No. 21-1689, D.I. \n14; Lamplight Licensing LLC v.

Canary \nConnect, Inc., Civ. No. 22-572, D.I. 16 at 1; Backertop Licensing LLC v. August \nHome, Inc., Civ. No. 22-573, D.I. 19 at 1. Mr. Chong had filed a total of four \ncases for Backertop beginning in April 2022. Backertop asserted in all four actions \nthe same three patents: U.S. Patent No. 9,332,385, U.S. Patent No. 9,654,617, and \nU.S. Patent No. 10,728,382. In three of the actions, it also asserted U.S. Patent No. \n10,477,011. Backertop had voluntarily dismissed in August 2022 the other two \ncases.8' 9 \nv. Ezlo Innovation Ltd., Civ.

Mr. Chong filed \namended disclosure statements in which Creekview represented that \"its sole \nowner and managing partner [sic] is Jacob LaPray.\" Creekview IP LLC v. Jabra \nCorp., Civ. No. 22-426, D.I. 14 at 1; Creekview IP LLC v. Skullcandy Inc., Civ. \nNo. 22-427, D.I. 16 at 1. Creekview had asserted in these two cases and in four \nother related cases filed by Mr. Chong beginning in November 2021 the same \nsingle patent: U.S. Patent No. 9,608,472. The four other cases were voluntarily \n24 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 26 of 80 PageID #: 539VI. \nBy this time, even putting aside Mr. Ramey's failure to appear at the \nSeptember 1 hearing, I had numerous concerns with respect to the cases being \nhandled by Messrs. Chong and Ramey. It was undisputed that five of their clients \nhad failed to comply with the Disclosure Order in 11 cases, and Mr. Chong had not \noffered at the September 1 hearing a satisfactory explanation for these failures. On \nthe contrary, Mr. Chong had given conflicting statements during the hearing about \nwhether Mr. Ramey played a role in their clients' failures to comply with the \nDisclosure Order. I was also troubled by the fact that Mr. Chong's unequivocal \nrepresentation during the hearing that Carlos Gorrichategui owned Missed Call \nwas at odds with the September 2 amended disclosure in which Missed Call \nrepresented that its sole owner was Heman Perec. \nThere was also reason to believe that Mr. Chong's cases shared with the \nNimitz cases more than simply the fact that the plaintiffs in all these cases had \nfailed to comply with the Disclosure Order. The amended disclosures filed by Mr. \nChong on September 2 identified Sally Pugal as Lamplight's sole owner and Lori \ndismissed before September 2. See Creekview JP LLC v. Corsair Gaming, Inc., \nCiv. No. 21-1685, D.I. 8; Creekview IP LLC v. Belkin Int'!, Inc., Civ. No. 21-1686, \nD.I. 15; Creekview IP LLC v. Best Buy Co., Inc., Civ. No. 22-425, D.I. 20; \nCreekview IP LLC v. Zound Indus. USA Inc., Civ. No. 22-428, D.I. 12. \n25 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 27 of 80 PageID #: 540LaPray as Backertop's sole owner. Nimitz's amended disclosure filed in response \nto the May 13 show cause order identified Mark Hall as its sole owner. As noted \nabove, the RPX article filed in support of Amazon's objection to Longbeam's \namended disclosure statement identified Ms. Pugal, Ms. LaPray, and Mr. Hall each \nas managing members of different LLCs that had been formed and then assigned \nIP Edge-related patents just before bringing a series of lawsuits alleging \ninfringement of those patents. Longbeam had not disputed these allegations; nor \nhad it denied that it was an IP Edge-related entity. IP Edge is a well-known patent \nmonetization firm, but neither Nimitz nor Mr. Chang's clients had disclosed a \nthird-party funding arrangement with IP Edge. \nMy law clerk's review of the PTO's patent assignment database also \nappeared to confirm that Mr. Pazuniak's Nimitz cases and Mr. Chang's Mellaconic \ncases were connected with each other and with IP Edge. Nimitz filed with the \nPTO on August 26, 2021-four days before it filed the first of its 11 cases in this \nCourt-an assignment of the #328 patent. The assignment, dated August 20, 2021, \nidentifies the assignor of the patent as Burley Licensing LLC and the assignee as \nNimitz. The assignment identifies Hau Bui as the managing member of Burley \nand Mark Hall as the managing member of Nimitz. Hall is also identified as the \n\"submitter\" of the assignment to the PTO, and the email address provided to the \n26 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 28 of 80 PageID #: 541PTO for Hall is linhd@ip-edge.com-the same email address given for Sharon \nBullion in the assignment of the patents Longbeam asserted against Amazon. \nBased on the totality of this information, I was concerned that Nimitz and \nthe LLC plaintiffs represented by Mr. Chong may not have complied with the \nThird-Party Funding Order, as none of those parties had disclosed a funding \narrangement with IP Edge. Accordingly, on September 12 and 13, 2022, I issued \norders in these cases convening a series of evidentiary hearings \"to determine \nwhether [each] Plaintiff has complied with the Court's standing order regarding \nthird-party litigation funding.\" Civ. No. 21-1247, D.I. 24 at 2; Civ. No. 21-1362, \nD.I. 18 at 2; Civ. No. 21-1855, D.I. 19 at 2; Civ. No. 22-413, D.I. 16 at 2; Civ. No. \n22-418, D.I. 13 at 2; Civ No. 22-1017, D.I. 9 at 2; Civ.

For each \nhearing, I directed the owner of the plaintiff LLC to be present. And because \nMessrs. Bui and Hall were identified as the managing members respectively of the \nassignor and the assignee in the #328 patent assignment filed with the PTO, I \nscheduled a single hearing on November 4 for the Nimitz and Mellaconic cases. \n27 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 29 of 80 PageID #: 542VII. \nOn October 12, 2022, Mr. Chong asked me to include the Lamplight cases at \nthe November 4 Nimitz/Mellaconic hearing to accommodate the work schedule of \nLamplight's owner, Sally Pugal. Civ. No. 22-418, D.I. 17; Civ. No. 22-1017, \nD.I. 13. I agreed to that request. Civ. No. 22-418, October 17, 2022 Oral Order; \nCiv. No. 22-1017, October 17, 2022 Oral Order. \nOn October 31, Mr. Chong filed a letter in which he stated: \nAn in-person Evidentiary Hearing for the above \ncases is scheduled for this Friday, November 4, 2022, \nwhich was moved from November 10, 2022 expressly to \naccommodate Sally Pugal, the owner of Lamplight. On \nOctober 21, 2022, I was first advised by Ms. Pugal' s \nrepresentative that she has a health-related issue which \nnow may prevent her from attending the hearing with the \nCourt here in Delaware. I do not have more detailed \ninformation about the nature of her medical issue. Every \nday since October 24, including over the weekends, I \nhave attempted to contact Ms. Pugal multiple times bye\u00ad\nmail and telephone without success. \nAlthough Ms. Pugal's flight reservation and hotel \naccommodations remain in place, as of this moment, I am \nnot certain whether Ms. Pugal actually will travel to \nDelaware or appear for the hearing. In all prior \ncommunications that my staff and I had with Ms. Pugal \nshe made every indication that she would travel to \nDelaware and would appear before the Court on \nNovember 4, 2022. \nI wanted to bring this issue to the Court's attention \nand I will provide the Court with any updates promptly. \n28 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 30 of 80 PageID #: 543I am available to confer with your Honor should the \nCourt need any additional information prior to the \nhearing. \nCiv. No. 22-418, D.I. 20 at 1-2; Civ. No. 22-1017, D.I. 14 at 1-2. \nLate in the afternoon of November 3, Mr. Chong filed a letter requesting a \ncontinuance of the November 4 hearing because of Ms. Pugal's health issues. Civ. \nNo. 22-418, D.I. 22; Civ. No. 22-1017, D.I. 15. \nVIII. \nMs. Pugal did not appear at the November 4 hearing. At the outset of the \nhearing, I questioned Mr. Chong about his statement in his October 31 letter that \nhe \"was first advised by Ms. Pugal's representative that she has a health-related \nissue which now may prevent her from attending the hearing\": \nTHE COURT: Who was [Ms. Pugal's] representative? \nMR. CHONG: ... So Ms. Pugal['s] ... representative is \na company called Mavexar, who handles-who I have \nbeen working with, that handles a lot of, you know, is\u00ad\nbasically, speaks on her behalf as her representative. \n* * * * \nTHE COURT: Okay. So what is Mavexar? \nMR. CHONG: My understanding, Mavexar is the-M\u00ad\nA-V-E-X-A-R-is the consulting company that Ms. \nPugal has retained in regards to Lamplight. \nTHE COURT: Okay. Now, your understanding is that \nMs. Pugal retained this consulting company. How do \nyou have that understanding? \n29 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 31 of 80 PageID #: 544MR. CHONG: I've been working with Mavexar in\u00ad\nwith the Lamplight patents. So when I contact \nLamplight, I contact Mavexar .... \n* * * * \nTHE COURT: Had you ever spoken with [Ms. Pugal] \nbefore you filed these cases? \nMR. CHONG: I did not speak with her before I filed \nthese cases. Mavexar had reached out to me on her \nbehalf. And we had communicated through Mavexar, \nand had our fee agreement, and so forth, signed as \nMavexar was acting as a representative of Ms. Pugal. \nTHE COURT: So you are representing an entity that's \nexclusively owned by somebody, and you signed a \nretention letter with whom? With Lamplight? \nMR. CHONG: Yes. \nTHE COURT: And you had never met the owner of \nLamplight when you signed the retention letter, is what \nyou're telling me? \nMR. CHONG: That is correct. \nTHE COURT: And, in fact, it sounds like you never had \nany discussions with the owner of Lamplight when you \nsigned the retention letter with Lamplight. \nMR. CHONG: I did not speak with her directly. I spoke \nwith the representatives. \nTHE COURT: Her representative who's not an \nemployee of Lamplight. This is a consulting firm, a \nseparate entity; is that right? \n30 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 32 of 80 PageID #: 545MR. CHONG: That is correct. \nTHE COURT: Okay. It's Mavexar. \nMR. CHONG: That is correct. \nTHE COURT: All right. Do you know what the rules of \nethics are about having a relationship with a client that \nis initiated by a third party? \nI'm trying to think of any other context, so help me \nout. I'm just trying to think what rules would be \napplicable. I'm not judging. I'm asking questions here. \nBut I'm trying to understand how you end up in an \nattorney-client relationship with an LLC that is \nexclusively owned by an individual that you have never \nmet and you've had no conversations with an employee \nof the LLC, and yet you end up in an attorney-client \nrelationship with the LLC. \nDo you know what rules would be implicated by \nthat? \nMR. CHONG: So Your Honor, I have to stop and think. \nTHE COURT: How did you run conflicts? I mean, I'm \njust trying to think how you would run conflicts when \nyou're dealing with a third party that's negotiating with \nyou to set up an attorney-client relationship with \nsomebody else, another entity. \nI'm trying to figure out how you run conflicts. Did \nyou run conflicts? \nMR. CHONG: Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: And it's all based on representations from \na third party, not from the client, correct? \nMR. CHONG: That is correct, Your Honor. \n31 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 33 of 80 PageID #: 546THE COURT: All right. \n* * * * \nTHE COURT: Do you have your retention letter? \nMR. CHONG: Yes, I do, Your Honor. \nD.I. 26 at 6:21-7:1, 7:6-15, 10:3-12:7, 18:24-25 (emphasis added). \nAt this point, at my request and without objection Mr. Chong handed up a \ncopy of his firm's retention letter with Lamplight. The letter is signed by Mr. \nChong on behalf of his firm and by Sally Pugal on behalf of Lamplight. A cursory \nreview of the retention letter at the hearing raised troubling questions. For \nexample, paragraph 24 of the retention letter reads as follows: \nCLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT WAS \nADVISED TO RETAIN INDEPENDENT LEGAL \nCOUNSEL TO REPRESENT CLIENT IN \nCONNECTION WITH THE NEGOTIATION AND \nEXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND WITH \nRESPECT TO THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE \nABOVE. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES \nTHAT IT WAS ADVISED THAT FIRM HAS A \nCONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT PREVENTS IT \nFROM REPRESENTING CLIENT IN ANYWAY \nWITH RESPECT TO THE NEGOTIATION AND \nEXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT \nFIRM HAS NOT DONE SO. \nNov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 1 at 7 (capitalization in the original). I asked Mr. Chong \nspecifically about this paragraph: \n32 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 34 of 80 PageID #: 547THE COURT: Since you never spoke with her, how did \nyou advise Lamplight Licensing, which is the client, the \nonly member of which is Ms. Pugal? \nHow did you actually advise Lamplight, LLC, to \nretain independent legal counsel to represent it in \nconnection with the negotiation and execution of your \nretainer agreement? \nMR. CHONG: That was advised through its \nrepresentatives. So Mavexar was speaking on behalf of \nMs. Puga! and handled the discussions. So I had \ndiscussed-I had everything-every discussion I've had \nwas with Mavexar as if it was Lamplight. \nD.I. 26 at 20:14-25 (emphasis added). \nMr. Chong also revealed at the hearing that he did not know the financial \nterms ofMavexar's relationship with Lamplight. See D.I. 26 at 29:14-17 (\"THE \nCOURT: Do you know what the financial terms ofMavexar's relationship with \nLamplight are? MR. CHONG: I don't. That's something that they have worked \nout themselves.\"). \nAt the conclusion of my colloquy with Mr. Chong, I stated that I was \"not \nable to make any more definitive judgments about the accuracy of the third-party \nfunding statements, which is what gave rise to this hearing[,] ... without hearing \ndirectly from\" Ms. Pugal, D.I. 26 at 37:8-12; and I asked Mr. Chong to provide \nwithin 30 days a status report of Ms. Pugal's health and ability to participate in a \nhearing, D.I. 26 at 39:9-16. \n33 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 35 of 80 PageID #: 548At this point, although I had convened the hearing to determine if \nLamplight, Nimitz, and Mellaconic had complied with the Third-Party Funding \nOrder, I was now as concerned, if not more concerned, about whether Mr. Chong \nhad acted consistent with the Rules of Professional Conduct and whether \nMavexar-an entity I had never heard of-was the real party in interest in \nLamplight's cases. \nIX. \nI next turned to the Nimitz cases and invited Mr. Pazuniak to the podium. \nThis discussion ensued: \nMR. P AZUNIAK: Similar to Mr. Chong ... I was \ncontacted by what I understood to be an agent for Nimitz \nTechnologies. \nTHE COURT: A nonlawyer agent, right? \nMR. PAZUNIAK: It's not a lawyer. It's a lady by the \nname of Linh Dietz, L-I-N-H D-I-T-Z. \n* * * * ... [S]he was representing Nimitz Technologies. \nAnd she had provided the basic information. \nThereafter, I did my own investigation, in the \nsense of double-checking the patent, double-checking the \nNimitz Technology. For example, I did go to the Texas \nSecretary of State's [w]ebsite to gain the information \nabout Nimitz Technology, and that's what I put down \ninto the complaint. \nSimilar, I went to the Delaware Secretary of \nState's office to obtain information on the defendants, \n34 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 36 of 80 PageID #: 549and making sure that the correct entities were named, \ncorrect spellings and correct addresses. \nThe complaint was entirely drafted by me. \nPrior to that, we, of course, had the retainer \nagreement. Th[e} retainer agreement, again, I drafted. \nAnd it was forwarded to Linh Dietz, to forward to Mark \nHall as the princip[al] of Nimitz Technologies. \nI knew that he was the princip[al] because of the\u00ad\nI had double-checked the Secretary of State's office \nbefore I prepared the retainer letter. \nTHE COURT: Okay. \nMR. P AZUNIAK: And-\nTHE COURT: So you knew he was the princip[al] based \non the Secretary of State's disclosure-\nMR. P AZUNIAK: And-\nTHE COURT: -he was the princip[al] ofNimitz? \nMR. PAZUNIAK: He is-Mr. Hall is the-I think \nthat-I want to make sure I have the phrase right. He's \nthe managing member of the entity. And it was \nconfirmed by Ms. Dietz that he was the sole, 100 percent, \nowner of the entity. \nTHE COURT: Okay. \nMR. P AZUNIAK: When Your Honor's order came out, \nagain, I did the investigation. \nWith respect to the funding in this litigation, I \nknew pretty much what the funding was, because the \nonly funding that had been provided had been by myself, \normy firm. \n35 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 37 of 80 PageID #: 550THE COURT: Well, actually, can I stop you there? \nHow did you know that? I mean, you obviously know \nwhether you're providing funding or not. \nMR. P AZUNIAK: Yeah. \nTHE COURT: How do you know there isn't some third \nparty out there that's providing funding? \nMR. PAZUNIAK: Well, again-yes, I was getting to \nthat. \nTHE COURT: Oh, okay. So I thought you just said that \nyou knew that, since you were the only funder. \nMR. P AZUNIAK: I should say that I knew that, what \nfunding had been required, you know, for the filing of \nthe-and maintaining of the lawsuits, and that had been \nprovided by my firm as an advance. And we, of course, \nhave a retainer agreement that required Nimitz \nTechnology to be responsible for all costs. \nD.I. 26 at 41:24-44:13 (emphasis added). \nMr. Pazuniak then appeared to suggest that Linh Dietz was \nsomehow connected to Mavexar, the entity whose existence I had just \nlearned of from Mr. Chong: \nMR. P AZUNIAK: Once Your Honor's question was \nbrought up, I did consult with Ms. Dietz. She provided, \nto me, the agreement between Mavexar and the Nimitz \nTechnology, which I double-checked and confirmed that \nany funds advanced by Mavexar are-would be the \nresponsibility of Nimitz Technology. Which, of course, \nat that point, was kind of moot because, to my knowledge \n36 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 38 of 80 PageID #: 551in the litigation, no other funds had been expended, other \nthan those that I-my firm had incurred. \n* * * * ... I did go and check and there was no \nnonrecourse funding of any sort provided to Nimitz \nTechnology, period. \nAnd this was-and, again, I'm trying to be very \ncareful because we have attorney-client relationship \nissues. And-\nTHE COURT: Yeah. I don't know how you have \nattorney-client relationship issues if you 're dealing with \nthe client through a nonlawyer third party. That, right \naway, I mean-and I'm willing to hear you. But that \ndoesn 't sound right to me. \nEither you have that or, then, I think you have \nunauthorized practice of law issues that are arising \nperhaps in other states. \nMR. PAZUNIAK: Well, Your Honor, but there is \ncommunications between me and Mr. Hall, i.e. Nimitz. \nTHE COURT: I hear you. I get that. \nMR. PAZUNIAK: And that's why I'm trying to be \ncareful. \nTHE COURT: Okay. \nMR. PAZUNIAK: When I say \"confirmed,\" obviously, I \ndid my due diligence in accordance with Rule 11 in \nmaking the representations. And-so I'm trying to be \ncareful not to inadvertently, you know, create doubt on \nmy ability to invoke the privilege. \nTHE COURT: Sure. Okay. And that's fair. That's a \ngood thing to be concerned about. \n37 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 39 of 80 PageID #: 552D.I. 26 at 44:14-22, 46:8-47:9 (emphasis added). \nBased on these representations from Mr. Pazuniak, I was concerned that, \nlike Mr. Chong, Mr. Pazuniak may not have acted consistent with the Rules of \nProfessional Conduct. Although Mr. Pazuniak stated, \"[T]here is communications \nbetween me and Mr. Hall, i.e. Nimitz,\" his comments overall indicated that he \ncommunicated with Nimitz exclusively through Linh Dietz, whom Mr. Pazuniak \nhad said was not a lawyer. D.I. 26 at 41:24-42:4, 46:22-23. That made me \nquestion, for example, how Mr. Pazuniak could fulfill his ethical obligation under \nRule 1.4(b) to \"explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the \nclient to make informed decisions regarding the representation\"; and how could he \nbe confident that he had satisfied his professional obligations under Rule 1.2, \nwhich provides that \"a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the \nobjectives of representation and, as required by Rule 1.4, shall consult with the \nclient as to the means by which they are to be pursued\"? MODEL RULES OF PRO. \nCONDUCT r. l.4(b), 1.2 (AM. BARASS'N 2022). \nMr. Pazuniak's description of his dealings with Linh Dietz also raised \nquestions about Mavexar's role in these cases. Was Mavexar, as opposed to \nNimitz, the real client whose interests were being served by Mr. Pazuniak's firm? \nFinally, the question of IP Edge's role in these cases-the question that gave rise to \n38 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 40 of 80 PageID #: 553my concern that Nimitz had not complied with the Third-Party Funding Order\u00ad\nremained. Linh Dietz seemed a logical candidate for the linhd@ip-edge.com email \naddress used by Nimitz and Longbeam with the PTO. \nFor these reasons, I told Mr. Pazuniak that \"I'd like to have Mr. Hall take the \nstand.\" D.I. 26 at 49. Mr. Pazuniak replied, \"Sure. Of course.\" D.I. 26 at 49: 12-\n13. I made very clear the scope of my intended questioning of Mr. Hall; I stated: \n\"I'd like to know about how he came to come in possession of this patent and \nNimitz and its financial relationships.\" D.I. 26 at 49:17-19. This discussion \nfollowed: \nMR. PAZUNIAK: That's-Your Honor, the only \nrequest I would make is that the information be provided \nin a closed courtroom. This is information that is private. \nIt's business related. It's-if we get in other situations, \nthis kind of information would be subject to a protective \norder. \n* * * * \nI'm not asking the Court to be precluded from \npursuing its intended line of inquiry .... \n. . . And I just want to make sure that, as we go \nforward, we're not waiving any rights. And therefore, I \ndo formally request that because the questions and \nanswers may involve matters of personal privacy and \nbusiness arrangements that are not public, and have \nalways been intended to be kept confidential, that the \ninformation be heard in a closed courtroom. \nTHE COURT: All right. So I think the way we'll \naddress that is, let's take it on a question-by-question \nbasis. \n39 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 41 of 80 PageID #: 554MR. PAZUNIAK: Okay. \nTHE COURT: And, you know, you can make an \nobjection or ask, if I put to the witness a certain question, \nyou can stand up and say you think this implicates some \nkind of interest that would be sufficient under Third \nCircuit law. \nWhich you should make sure you've read Third \nCircuit law. It is very, very hard to keep something \nunder seal in the Third Circuit, and it's the Third Circuit \nthat governs. \nD.I. 26 at 49:20-25, 50:12-13, 50:18-51:12. \nAfter a short break, Mr. Hall took the stand. I asked him some general \nbackground questions and then turned to the subject of Nimitz: \nQ. Well, what does Nimitz do? \nA. Nimitz monetizes patents. \nQ. What does that mean, to \"monetize[] patents\"? \nA. Make money off of existing patents. \nQ. How many patents does Nimitz own? \nA. I don't know offhand. I'd have to look back at the \npaperwork. \n* * * * \nQ. Nimitz owns the patent that's been asserted in these \ncases; is that right? \nA. Correct. \n* * * * \nQ. How did you come to acquire the [#]328 patent? \n40 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 42 of 80 PageID #: 555A. I was presented an opportunity. \nQ. Bywhom? \nA. Mavexar. \nQ. Who is Mavexar? \nA. As an entity? I'm not sure what you mean. \nQ. Well, you're the one who used the phrase. So what \ndid you mean when you said you were presented an \nopportunity by Mavexar. I'm just following up on your \nquestion, sir. \nA. Okay. Consulting agency. \n* * * * \nQ. Consulting agency that does what? \nA. My understanding is they look for patents. \nQ. How did you first learn ofMavexar? \nA. I was presented an opportunity by Mavexar and we \ndiscussed what they did, and what the opportunity would \nentail. \nQ. Where did that presentation of the opportunity occur? \nA. Over the phone. \nQ. Whom did you speak with? \nA. Linh Dietz. \n* * * * \nQ. How did you pay for the [#328] patent? \n41 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 43 of 80 PageID #: 556A. There was an agreement between Mavexar and \nmyself where I would assume liability. \nQ. What does that mean? \nA. No money exchanged hands from my end. \nQ. You have to-I'm not a financial guy, so you have to \nexplain it to me. \nSo you own the patent, but no money-you didn't \nexchange any money for it? \nA. No. \nQ. So is that what you're saying? \nA. Yes. \nQ. So how do you come to own something if you never \npaid for it with money? \nA. I wouldn't be able to explain it very well. That would \nbe a better question for Mavexar. \nQ. Well, you're the owner? \nA. Correct. \nQ. How do you know you 're the owner if you didn't pay \nanything for the patent? \nA. Because I have the paperwork that says I'm the \nowner. \n* * * * \nQ. Now, you said that you would assume liability for the \npatent, is that right, when you took ownership of it? \nA. Correct. \n42 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 44 of 80 PageID #: 557Q. What does that mean? \nA. Liability in case of-any monetary liability from a \ncase that did not proceed well. \nQ. So is it your understanding, then, if, in this case, for \ninstance, the Court assigned-or awarded attorney fees to \nthe other side, that you personally would have to pay for \nthem; is that right? \nA. I believe that's true, yes. \nQ. Do you have the documents with you today\u00ad\nA. I do not. \nQ. -that reflect your assumption of ownership of the \n[#]328 patent? \nA. I do not. \nD.I. 26 at 65:14-20, 66:2-4, 67:25-68:10, 68:14-23, 69:16-70:11, \n71:8-23 (emphasis added). \nAt this point, Mr. Pazuniak handed up copies of a \"Patent Assignment \nAgreement\" and its \"Exhibit A,\" which is a \"Patent Assignment\" that looks to be \nidentical to the assignment my law clerk had found on the PTO's patent \nassignment database for the #328 patent. Under the terms of the assignment, \nBurley Licensing, \"[f]or good and valuable consideration,\" \"assign[ed], \ntransfer[red], and convey[ed]\" to Nimitz ... \"all right, title, and interest that exist \n43 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 45 of 80 PageID #: 558today and may exist in the future in and to\" the #328 patent. Nov. 4, 2022 Hr' g, \nPatent Assignment Agreement, Ex. A at 1. I noted to Mr. Hall that the assignment \nidentified Hau Bui as the managing member of Burley and asked him if he knew \nMr. Bui. He replied, \"I do not.\" D.I. 26 at 72:8-11. \nThe remainder ofmy questioning of Mr. Hall reads in relevant part: \nQ. So the Exhibit A to the assignment says that \"For \ngood and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is \nhereby acknowledged, the patent is transferred to you.\" \nWhat was the good and valuable consideration you \nreceived? \nA. I'm not sure what you mean there. \nQ. Or I should say, rather, what is the good and valuable \nconsideration you paid for the patent? \nMR. P AZUNIAK: Objection. \nBY THE COURT: \nQ. Do you understand what good and valuable \nconsideration is? \nA. I believe I understand what you're asking. And the\u00ad\nQ. Well, put it in your own words. What do you think \nthat means? What does \"consideration\" mean? \nA. I would think-I think you mean some kind of \npayment. \nQ. Right. And so what did you pay them that persuaded \nsomebody to give you the patent? \n44 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 46 of 80 PageID #: 559A. My understanding of what it is, it's a business \nopportunity presented to me from Mavexar, similar to \nwhen I retained a management company for my rental \nproperties. I don't know the renters. I don't deal with \nthe renters. They do. That's the agreement that we have. \nIf there's proceeds to be made, there's an agreement \nbetween us as to what we split. If there's losses incurred, \nit's my property, I pay for the losses, similar to this. \nQ. Okay. And how much, then-well, then, is it your \nunderstanding that the revenue, the money that will be \nmade from the patent, will be obtained through litigation \nof the patent; is that fair? \nA. Yes. \nQ. What percentage of the litigation do you recover for \nassuming all this liability? \nA. I believe it's 10 percent. \nQ. So you're the owner of the patent, but you only get \none-tenth of it? \nA. Correct. \nQ. Well, did anyone explain to you why Mavexar wanted \nyou to assume liability for the patent? \nA. No one explained it, no. \nQ. Do you have an understanding as to why you 're \nassuming liability for the patent if you only would \nshare-or obtain JO percent of the proceeds from it? \nA. No. I viewed it as an investment, just like stocks. \n45 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 47 of 80 PageID #: 560Q. Were you involved in the litigation decisions in the \ncases that are filed that assert the patent? \nA. No. \nQ. And is it your understanding that all the litigation \ndecisions are made by the lawyers and Mavexar? \nA. Correct. \n* * * * \nQ. Have you ever heard of IP Edge? \nA. I have. \nQ. What do you know about it? \nA. Notmuch. \nQ. Have you ever had any interactions with IP Edge? \nA. Other than Linh Ditz's e-mail address, no. \nQ. And that's the only knowledge you have of IP Edge, \nis the fact that she has an IP Edge e-mail address; is that \nright? \nA. Correct. Correct. \n* * * * \nQ. And you mentioned you didn 't have any involvement \nin the litigation decisions. So do you have prior \nknow ledge of the filing of complaints? \nA. No. \nQ. Do you have any prior knowledge of any settlements \nreached in litigation filed-\nA. No. \n46 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 48 of 80 PageID #: 561Q. -to assert the patent-let me\u00ad\nA. Sorry. \nQ. I'm sorry. That's all right. Do you have any prior \nknowledge of settlements that are reached in litigation in \nwhich Nimitz patents are asserted? \nA. No. \nQ. So you 're just told after the fact? \nA. Correct. \nQ. So from your perspective, this is purely an investment \nopportunity, fair? \nA. Fair. \nQ. And although you are in name the owner of the \npatent, you defer solely to Mavexar and the lawyers to \nmake all the decisions associated with how the patent is \nasserted and how cases are settled, fair? \nA. Correct. \nQ. And that's really the motivation for you as an \ninvestor, fair? \nA. Correct. \n* * * * \nQ. Has Nimitz received any money from settlements \nrelating to its patents? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Approximately how much? \n47 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 49 of 80 PageID #: 562A. $4,000. \nQ. In total? \nA. (Witness nods head.) \nD.I. 26 at 72:25-75:2, 75:18-76:2, 76:13-77:14, 82:19-25 (emphasis added). \nBy the time Mr. Hall's testimony concluded, my concerns about whether \nMr. Pazuniak had acted consistent with the Rules of Professional Conduct had only \ngrown. Mr. Pazuniak was the only lawyer representing Nimitz in these cases; Mr. \nHall was the only owner and the only identified member of Nimitz. And yet Mr. \nPazuniak had apparently had no communications with Mr. Hall before the cases \nwere filed and had had no communications with Mr. Hall about settling the seven \nNimitz cases Mr. Pazuniak had moved to voluntarily dismiss between December \n14, 2021 and April 27, 2022. See Civ. No. 21-1246, D.I. 10; Civ. No. 21-1364, \nD.I. 8; Civ. No. 21-1249, D.I. 11; Civ. No. 21-1248, D.I. 10; Civ. No. 21-1360, \nD.I. 10; Civ. No. 21-1856, D.I. 9; Civ. No. 21-1363, D.I. 15. Under Model Rule \n1.2, the \"decision[ ] ... whether to settle a civil matter, must ... be made by the \nclient.\" MODEL RULES OF PRO. CONDUCT r. 1.2 cmt. (AM. BAR Ass 'N 2022). But \naccording to Mr. Hall, Mavexar and lawyers selected by Mavexar made all the \ndecisions associated with how the #328 patent was asserted and how cases were \nsettled. Mr. Hall learned of settlements only \"after the fact.\" D.I. 26 at 77:2-3. \n48 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 50 of 80 PageID #: 563It also appeared from Mr. Hall's testimony that Mavexar, not Nimitz, \ncontrolled the #328 patent, and that Nimitz did not in fact possess \"all right, title, \nand interest\" to the #328 patent as had been represented in the assignment filed \nwith the PTO. No doubt the assignment identified Nimitz as the assignee of the \npatent. But the assignment was filed by someone using what appeared to be Linh \nDietz's IP-Edge email account; Linh Dietz acted on behalf ofMavexar in \narranging for Mr. Hall to authorize Nimitz to appear as the assignee on the \nassignment; Mr. Hall said Nimitz had paid nothing for the assignment of the \npatent; the named assignor of the patent was not known by Mr. Hall but was \nconnected to IP Edge and apparently to Linh Dietz; Nimitz received only 10% of \nany revenue generated by the patent; and Nimitz played no role in the decisions \nassociated with asserting the #328 patent in and settling lawsuits. These facts \nsuggested that the assignment of the #328 patent could very well be a fiction, and \nthat frauds may have been perpetrated on the PTO and this Court. \nI thought those possibilities seemed even more likely after hearing the \ntestimony of the next witness, Hau Bui. \nX. \nHau Bui's story was similar in important ways to Mark Hall's. The owner \nand operator of a food truck and of what he described as a \"fried chicken joint,\" \n49 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 51 of 80 PageID #: 564Mr. Bui agreed to become the sole owner ofMellaconic to take advantage of\"an \nopportunity\" offered to him by the seemingly ubiquitous Linh Dietz. D.I. 26 at \n86:1-2, 87:2-12. As far as Mr. Bui knew, Mavexar formed Mellaconic for him in \n2020. D.I. 26 at 90:9-11. Like Mr. Hall, who said he \"wouldn't be able to explain \n[Nimitz's acquisition of its patent without an upfront payment] very well\" and that \nmy inquiry on the subject \"would be a better question for Mavexar,\" Mr. Bui \nstruggled to explain how and why Mellaconic was able to obtain patents without \npaying for them. And like Mr. Hall, Mr. Bui essentially acknowledged that he \nrubber stamped \"approvals\" of Mavexar' s decisions to file and settle lawsuits \nasserting patents putatively titled in Mellaconic' s name. \nAfter asking Mr. Bui briefly about his background, I turned to the subject of \nMellaconic: \nQ. What does Mellaconic do? \nA. Yeah. Mellaconic owns patents, the rights to patents. \nQ. All right. How many patents? \nA. I believe six. \nQ. And what types of patents? \nA. I haven't really looked over them. \nQ. Okay. How much did you pay for the patents? \n50 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 52 of 80 PageID #: 565A. I didn't pay for the patents. \nQ. So how do you come to own patents if you don't pay \nfor them? \nA. I was-came up-someone pushed me with the \nopportunity, selling the patents. \nQ. Who was that? Mellaconic? \nA. Mellaconic-no, Mavexar. Sorry. \nQ. Mavexar. Well, how did you come in touch with \nMavexar? \nA. Linh. \nQ. Is this Linh Dietz? \nA. Linh Dietz. \nQ. How do you know her? \nA. She's a friend. \nQ. When did she first approach you about this idea of \nassuming ownership of patents? \nA. I believe in 2020, right when the pandemic hit. \nQ. And what did she tell you? \nA. She just came up to me and just told me if I would \nlike an opportunity to deal with patents and make passive \nmcome. \n* * * * \nQ. So ... make a passive income. What does that mean? \n51 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 53 of 80 PageID #: 566A. Like, income. Coming in without, you know-I \ndon't know how to describe it. Just like, kind of like-\nQ. How about this? You don't have to do anything; is \nthat fair? \nA. Yeah, you don't have to do much, yeah. \nQ. Well, what do you have to do? \nA. As far as? \nQ. As far as getting ownership of patents. I assume the \npatents are worth something, in your mind? \nDo you think the patents are worth anything? \nA. Yes. \nQ. All right. Do you have any sense of how much \nthey're worth? \nA. I'm not an expert in patents. I wouldn't know. \nQ. Well, did Ms. Dietz or anyone else, when you took \nownership of the patents, give you any sense of what they \nthought the patents were worth? \nA. No. \nQ. Did you have to give up anything in order to assume \nownership of the patents? \nA. No, sir. \nQ. Did you have to take on any responsibilities to \nassume ownership of the patents? \n52 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 54 of 80 PageID #: 567A. As far as, just like, viewing the litigations and \neverything that come through. \nQ. Oh, so you do review the litigations? \nA. Yeah. \nQ. Tell me about what you do in that regard? \nA. So Mavexar will send me the litigations of what's \ngoing on or the, you know, attorney engagements. And \nthen I, essentially, if I sign-I approve of them or \ndisapprove of them. \nQ. How do you know whether to approve or disapprove \nof an attorney? \nA. I mean, I chose Mavexar and they're-they're-what \nis it?-they're good. Like, you know, they haven't done \nme wrong. \nD.I. 26 at 86:18-87:21, 88:2-89:14. \nI then turned to how Mellaconic and Mr. Bui were compensated for efforts \nto monetize the patents assigned to Mellaconic: \nQ. Well, so do you get a share, then, of lawsuits or \nsettlements that are brought using these six patents? \nIs that how you make money, passive income, as \nyou call it? \nA. Yeah. \nQ. About how much income have you made so far? \nA. Year to date? \n53 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 55 of 80 PageID #: 568Q. Well, when did Mellaconic buy its first-or not \nbuy-when did it assume ownership of its first patent, if \nyou remember? \nA. I can't remember off the top of my head. \nQ. Was it last year or the year before? \nA. I know it was formed in 2020, so ... \nQ. What's Mellaconic mean, as a name? \nA. It's just a name. \nQ. I mean, whose idea was the name? \nA. I don't know. \nQ. You don't know? \nA. I don't know. \nQ. Were you, basically, just provided the paperwork to \nform the LLC? \nA. Yes. They formed the LLC for me. \nQ. And so did they come up with the name? \nA. Yes, sir. \nQ. Have you ever-has Mellaconic sold any patents? \nA. Sold any patents? No. \nQ. Has it assigned any patents to anybody else? \nA. As far as license-licensing? \n54 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 56 of 80 PageID #: 569Q. Licensing? Okay. Has it licensed patents to other \npeople? \nA. They have licensed to, like, other companies to use \nthem. \nQ. Okay. Do you get a share of those proceeds? \nA. From what the settlement-from the litigations, I do. \nQ. So is it fair to say, the licensing have all occurred in \nconnection with litigation? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Okay. And you get a share of that? \nA. Yes. \nQ. What's your share? \nA. With? \nQ. Of the litigation or settlements. \nWhat's your share? Do you get a percentage \nshare? \nA. Percentage. \nQ. And what is it? \nMR. WERNOW: Objection, Your Honor. Just \nconfidential business information. \nTHE COURT: Go ahead. \nTHE WITNESS: 5 percent. \n55 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 57 of 80 PageID #: 570D.I. 26 at 89:15-91:14. \nMr. Wernow was not an attorney of record when he made this objection; nor \nhad he ever sought to be admitted pro hac vice to appear as Mellaconic' s counsel \nin the cases at issue in the November 4 hearing. Accordingly, I ignored the \nobjection. (I would nonetheless have overruled the objection even if it had been \nmade by counsel of record. Mr. Wernow cited and I know ofno legal authority \nthat would bar a court from requesting Mr. Bui under the circumstances presented \nhere to disclose the percentage he received from the settlements obtained by \nMavexar and the attorneys it hired putatively on Mellaconic's behalf.) \nMellaconic' s counsel of record in the two Mellaconic cases involved in the \nNovember 4 hearing (the 22-244 and 22-541 actions) were Mr. Chong and Andrew \nCurfman. Mr. Curfman had been admitted pro hac vice, but he was unable to \nattend the November 4 hearing for health reasons. Messrs. Curfman and Wernow \nare partners in the law firm of Sand, Sebolt & Wemow Co., LPA. Mr. Curfman \nhad been admitted pro hac vice to represent Mellaconic in 11 of the 19 related \ncases filed by Mellaconic. Importantly, as I will later explain, counsel had filed \nmotions to voluntarily dismiss ten of those cases before I issued my order \nconvening the November 4 hearing. \n56 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 58 of 80 PageID #: 571Having learned that Mellaconic received only 5% of the proceeds from any \nlitigation brought in its name, I turned next to what role Mellaconic played in those \nlitigations: \nQ .... Now, before a lawsuit is brought, do you read the \ncomplaint? \nA. What was that? \nQ. Before a lawsuit is brought-tell me how it comes to \nbe, the fact that a lawsuit is brought by Mellaconic? \nHow does it work? \nA. So they will meet with the documentations, and I \nhave to review the documentations, and then I either \napprove it or deny it. \nQ. Have you ever denied it? \nA. No. \nQ. Okay. And who sends you the documentation? Is it \nMavexar? \nA. Mavexar, yes. \nQ. Have you ever had an attorney represent you in any \nof these litigations? \nA. What's that? \nQ. Have you ever had an attorney represent you, to your \nknowledge, in these litigations? \nA. I mean, like, with the Mellaconic? Yeah. \n57 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 59 of 80 PageID #: 572Q. Okay. And what attorneys have represented \nMellaconic? \nA. Sand Sebolt, as far as I know. \nQ. Anybody else? \nA. I would have to go back and look. \nQ. Okay. And that would be-would that be Mr. \nCurfman? \nA. What was the name again? \nQ. Andrew Curfman; is that right? \nA. Uh-huh. \nQ. You to have say it. \nA. Yes. Sorry. \nQ. No, that's all right. No problem. So have you ever \nmet Mr. Curfman? \nA. Yes, virtually. \nQ. Virtually. \nWhen did you first meet him? \nA. Probably two months ago. \nQ. So that's after [the] lawsuits ha[d] been filed? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Have you ever had any communications with Mr. \nCurfman? I don't need to know what they are. But ha[d] \n58 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 60 of 80 PageID #: 573you ever had any communications with Mr. Curfman \nbefore two months ago? \nA. No. \nQ. So how was he retained to represent Mellaconic? \nA. Through Mavexar. \nQ. So you didn't have any discussions with him. \nMavexar handled all the negotiations with Mr. Curfman; \nis that right? \nA. Yeah. On my behalf, yes. \nD.I. 26 at 91:17-93:18. \nI then returned to the issue of how Mellaconic acquired its patents: \nQ. So I want you to try to help me understand this idea \nthat you can take ownership of a patent without paying \nfor it. \nYou know, normally, when you get something of \nvalue-you think these patents have value, don't you? \nA. Yes. \nQ. All right. So normally, when you get something of \nvalue, you have to pay something for it? \nA. Uh-huh. \nQ. Do you agree with that? \nA. Yes. \nQ. So what did you have to pay to take on these patents? \n59 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 61 of 80 PageID #: 574A. With the previous owners? \nQ. The patents that you own now. What did you have to \ngive up in value for you to be able to assume ownership \nof these patents? \nA. I didn't give nothing. \nQ. You didn't give them anything. So were they a gift? \nA. No. It's-\nQ. So what's the-then help me. I'm just trying to \nunderstand this concept. \nIf it's not a gift, you're not paying anything, why is \nsomeone giving you these patents? \nA. You would have to ask Mavexar that. \nQ. Did you take on any liability as a result of assuming \nownership of the patents? \nA. What do you mean by \"liability\"? \nQ. Well, so you don't know? \nA. What's that? \nQ. You don't know what \"liability\" means? \nA. I mean, I have a general idea, but. .. \nQ. Was there any risk that you assumed when you \nassumed ownership of the patents? \nA. Oh, there's always a risk in everything. \nQ. So what's the risk? \n60 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 62 of 80 PageID #: 575A. I mean, if things fall through, then I would have to \ncome out of pocket. \nQ. And what kind of things would you have to come out \nof pocket, is your understanding? \nA. So if, like, litigation goes wrong, Mavexar has the \nright to come after me for the costs of what was loaned. \n* * * * \nQ. Who pays for the lawyer fees to go out and sue \npeople \nusing the patents owned by Mellaconic? \nA. Mavexar. \nQ. And what is-do they loan you the money for that? \nA. Yes. It's a recourse. \nQ. What do you mean by \"recourse\"? \nA. Like a loan. \nQ. Well, how did you come up with the terms \n\"recourse\"? \nI'm just-what does that mean? \nA. All I know is it's like a loan. \n* * * * \nQ. . . . Have you ever had to pay any expenses associated \nwith any litigation for Mellaconic? \nA. Have I ever paid any litigation expenses, no. \nQ. Okay. And have you-again, apologize, if I asked \nyou. But have you-has Mellaconic ever made any \nmoney from any of the patents it's owned? \n61 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 63 of 80 PageID #: 576A. From the litigations? \nQ. Yes. \nA. Yes. \nQ. And how much, about, is that? \nA. I want to say-I don't know top of my head. \n11,000, maybe. \nQ. Okay. And then you also mentioned licensing that \ncame out of settlements. Does that include-is that part \nof the 11,000, or is that different? \nA. That's just with the settlement. That's what I've \ngotten. \nQ. So the total you've gotten, is it fair to say\u00ad\nA. Yes, 11,000 or so. \nQ. All right. And is it all through settlements that were \nconnected with litigation? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Okay. Do you know how much other people get? \nYou know what you get, right? Do you know how the 95 \npercent is broken up, who gets it? \nA. I do not know the exact, who gets, you know, \npercentage. \nQ. No? \n62 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 64 of 80 PageID #: 577A. Well, I know that the-like the back-end pay to the \nprevious patent owners. \nD.I. 26 at 93:22-95:12, 96:8-17, 98:3-99:9. \nI then asked Mr. Bui about assigning patents. Mr. Bui testified that he did \nnot recall ever signing documents to transfer any ofMellaconic's patents to \nanother entity or person. D.I. 26 at 99: 17-20. He also testified that the name Mark \nHall \"doesn't ring a bell.\" D.I. 26 at 99:15. \nI concluded my questioning of Mr. Bui as follows: \nQ. Is it fair to say that your involvement in all the \nlitigation was performed through Mavexar? \nA. Mavexar. \nQ. Mavexar. Sorry. \nA. Yes. \nQ. Thank you very much [for correcting my \npronunciation of Mavexar]. \nThat would be fair? \nA. Yes. \nQ. And, basically, is it fair to say that you do whatever \nthey advise? \nA. Yes. \nQ. You don't have any other knowledge to challenge any \nof their advice; is that fair? \n63 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 65 of 80 PageID #: 578A. Yeah. They've been doing it. I don't have any \nknowledge to object against them. \n* * * * \nQ. And you mentioned you met Mr. Curfman about two \nmonths ago remotely? \nA. Remotely, yeah. \nQ. Yeah. I don't want to know about the conversation \nyou had with him, the specifics, but why did you not \nmeet him until two months ago? \nWhat was it that prompted the meeting two months ago? \nA. This hearing. \nQ. Is it fair to say that you're aware that there was an \norder issued by the Court that required you to participate \nhere? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Was that what prompted the meeting? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Okay. And prior to that, you had --fair to say, you \nhad had no discussions with Mr. Curfman; is that fair? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Had you had any discussions with anybody from Mr. \nCurfman's law firm prior to that meeting? \nA. No. \nD.I. 26 at 99:21-100:10, 101:7-102:1. \n64 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 66 of 80 PageID #: 579As Mr. Bui walked away from the witness stand, he was approached by Mr. \nWernow. The two men engaged in a brief conversation during which Mr. Wernow \nappeared to show Mr. Bui some documents. D.I. 26 at 102. Mr. Wernow then \nturned to ask me ifhe could \"put Mr. Bui back on the stand just to correct a \nstatement?\" D .I. 26 at 102: 16-19. I told Mr. W ernow that since he was not an \nattorney of record, he could not do that. D.I. 26 at 102:11-13. (I had no \nknowledge at the time that Mr. Wernow had represented Mellaconic in some of the \nrelated cases.) Mr. Chong then handed up a motion to admit Mr. Wernow pro hac \nvice, which I reviewed and granted. D.I. 26 at 102:20-103 :4. I then asked Mr. Bui \nto retake the stand and allowed Mr. Wernow to question him. \nMr. Wernow began by handing Mr. Bui a Patent Assignment Agreement \nexecuted by Mellaconic and Empire Technology Development LLC on August 10, \n2020-the month before Mr. Chong filed the first Mellaconic case in this Court. \nSee Civ. No. 20-1323, D.I. 1. Under the terms of the agreement, Empire \nTechnology assigned to Mellaconic \"all right, title, and interest\" to six patents, \nincluding the #435 patent asserted by Mellaconic in its 19 cases filed by Mr. \nChong. Nov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 2 at 1. The Agreement appeared to have been \nsigned by Mr. Bui on behalf ofMellaconic. Nov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 2 at 11. The \n65 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 67 of 80 PageID #: 580email address given for Mr. Bui in the agreement is info@ip-edge.com. Nov. 4, \n2022 Hr' g, Ex. 2 at 9. \nMr. Wernow then said, \"I just wanted to clarify some things I heard when \nyou were speaking with his Honor earlier,\" and began to walk Mr. Bui through the \ndocument. D .I. 26 at 103 :21-104 :2. I interjected and the following ensued: \nTHE COURT: \nSo actually, I'm going to object to leading questions. I \nmean, if you want to make attorney argument, you can \nbring the documents up, and you can show me and make \nyour argument. \nBut one of the important reasons why I wanted to \nhave a hearing, is to find out the reality, and find out who \nreally is the beneficial owner, who's got the real interest \nin the litigation. And the best answers you get are \nfrom-the most truthful answer you get to things like that \nare open-ended questions. I don't want you to walk this \nwitness through a legal document. \nMR. WERNOW: Sure. \nTHE COURT: All right. And I can read the legal \ndocument. \nMR. WERNOW: Sure. Can we just ask-\nBY MR. WERNOW: \nQ. In reviewing Page 2-or Section 3, the \nconsiderations section of Exhibit 2, can you please tell \nthe Court how Mellaconic has paid for these patents? \nTHE COURT: I don't need that. I can read the \ndocument. You want to ask him open-ended questions, \ngo ahead. Ask him what he remembers. Ask him what \n66 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 68 of 80 PageID #: 581he knows. Ask him his understanding. Let's not have \nhim go read a document. \nMR. WERNOW: Sure. \nBY MR. WERNOW: \nQ. What do you remember about this patent purchase \nagreement, Mr. Bui? \nA. There was 50 percent take back towards the previous. \nQ. For consideration? \nA. For consideration of the net proceeds. \nD.I. 26 at 104:3-105:8. \nWith this answer, Mr. Wemow ended his questioning of Mr. Bui about the \nPatent Assignment Agreement and what Mellaconic paid for the six patents Mr. \nBui said it owned. The provision in the Patent Assignment Agreement Mr. \nWemow wanted Mr. Bui to repeat in Court reads: \"As consideration, [Mellaconic] \nshall pay [Empire] fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds received by \n[Mellaconic] as a result of enforcement ofthe\" six patents covered by the \nagreement. Nov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 2 at 2. \nThe exchange between Mr. Wemow and Mr. Bui, in my mind, raised more \nquestions than it answered. It certainly did not leave me confident that Mr. Bui \nunderstood the meaning or effect of the provision; nor did it explain or give reason \nto disregard Mr. Bui's earlier testimony that he \"didn't give nothing\" to assume \n67 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 69 of 80 PageID #: 582ownership of the patents titled in Mellaconic's name and that Mellaconic received \nonly 5% of the revenue generated from asserting in litigation the patents it \npurportedly had \"all right, title, and interest\" in. Mr. Bui had already testified that \nsome portion of the 95% of the litigation proceeds that Mellaconic did not receive \nwent to a prior owner of the asserted patent. \nMr. Wernow then turned to a Consulting Agreement he had handed Mr. Bui. \nThe Consulting Agreement was executed by Mellaconic and Mavexar on August \n11, 2020. Under the heading \"Responsibilities,\" the Consulting Agreement states \nthat Mavexar \nshall provide non-legal services, including one or more of \nthe following: (a) identify companies that potentially \ninfringe on the rights covered by the patents owned by \n[Mellaconic] (\"the Patents\"), (b) assist [Mellaconic] in \nmonetizing the Patents; ( c) assist in identifying products \nand/or services covered by the Patents; ( d) select and \nnegotiate rates to enable retention of counsel; and ( e) \nmanage counsel as necessary during the course of \nlitigation and licensing efforts. \nNov. 4, 2022 Hr' g, Ex. 3 at \u00a7 1. The Agreement provides that \"[i]n exchange for \nthe services provided by [Mavexar],\" Mellaconic agrees to pay Mavexar an \nunidentified percentage of the \"Net Proceeds,\" which the agreement defines as \n\"Gross Recovery minus Costs and Expenses.\" Nov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 3 at\u00a7 2. \nThe agreement defines \"Gross Recovery\" as \"the gross amount of any monies and \n68 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 70 of 80 PageID #: 583other forms of consideration received through monetization of the Patents\" and \nfurther provides that \"Gross Recovery shall include, without limitation, any and all \nsettlement fees, licensing fees, fees from a sale, or other payment from other \ntransactions, as well as, any other proceeds (including assets) related to the \nPatents.\" Nov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 3 at\u00a7 2. \nThe Consulting Agreement also provides that \n[f]or all Costs and Expenses relating to the monetization \nof the Patents, [Mavexar] shall advance such Costs and \nExpenses as one or more loans to [Mellaconic]. Such \nloans are reimbursable from Gross Recovery. In the \nevent any such loan is not paid back in full from Gross \nRecovery, [Mellaconic] shall be responsible for full \npayment of all such loans. If [Mellaconic] fails to make \nsuch payment within 3 0 days following the termination \nof the final litigation filed pursuant to this Agreement, \n[Mavexar] shall have all available recourse pursuant to \nlaw to obtain recovery for such loans. \nFurther, upon execution of this agreement, [Mellaconic] \nhereby grants to [Mavexar] a lien on any Gross \nRecovery, to the full extent permitted by Texas law, to \nsecure [Mavexar' s] Costs and Expenses reimbursable in \naccordance with this agreement. \nNov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 3 at\u00a7 3. And finally, the Consulting Agreement states that \n[Mellaconic] is the sole owner and final decision maker \non any and all decisions relating, either directly or \nindirectly, to the prosecution, litigation, licensing, and, \nmore generally, monetization of the Patents. \nNov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 3 at\u00a7 3. \n69 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 71 of 80 PageID #: 584Mr. Wernow asked Mr. Bui, \"What's your recollection of [the Consulting \nAgreement] with respect to the recourse base repayment?\" Mr. Bui answered: \"So \nMavexar basically pays for the litigations of the-fees for litigations. And then if \nall goes wrong, they have the right to come after me for the litigation fees.\" D.I. \n26 at 105:10-17. \nMr. Wernow then ended his examination of Mr. Bui as follows: \nQ. What do you do for Mellaconic IP, LLC, when you \nreceive a complaint? \nA. I review it and I either confirm it or deny it. \nQ. And you can deny it, correct? \nA. I can deny it. \nD.I. 26 at 106:21-25. \nNeither this line of questioning nor the Consulting Agreement assuaged my \nconcerns about the conduct of the lawyers before me and the role Mavexar was \nplaying in the cases filed by.Messrs. Pazuniak and Chong. Mr. Bui may have said \nin response to Mr. Wernow's leading question that he could \"deny\" \"a complaint\" \nhe received from Mavexar and the Consulting Agreement may have stated that \nMellaconic \"was the final decision maker\" on all decisions relating to the \nmonetization of the patents titled in Mellaconic's name, but Mr. Bui's testimony as \na whole seemed to make clear that he did not \"have any knowledge to object \n70 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 72 of 80 PageID #: 585against\" Mavexar' s advice and that he understood his role was as a \"passive\" \nrubber stamper of whatever Mavexar put in front of him. \nEqually, if not more, troubling was Mr. Bui's testimony about his \ncommunications ( or lack of communications) with the lawyers selected by \nMavexar to represent Mellaconic. It was now undisputed that Mavexar was paying \nMellaconic's attorney fees upfront. Mr. Bui had testified that he had had no \ncommunications with the lawyers selected by Mavexar to represent Mellaconic \nuntil after I had issued the September 2022 orders convening the November 4 \nhearing. But by the time I issued those orders, Messrs. Chong and Curfman had \nalready filed voluntary motions to dismiss ten of Mellaconic' s cases. (I would \nlearn after the hearing that Mr. Wernow had been admitted pro hac vice to \nrepresent Mellaconic in six of the 19 related cases filed by Mellaconic and that \ncounsel had moved to dismiss those six cases on or before November 2021.) \nModel Rule l.8(f) narrowly defines when an attorney may accept third-party \npayment for representing a client. It provides that \n[a] lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing \na client from one other than the client unless: \n(1) the client gives informed consent; 10 \n10 Informed consent refers to \"the agreement by a person to a proposed course of \nconduct after the lawyer has communicated adequate information and explanation \n71 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 73 of 80 PageID #: 586(2) there is no interference with the lawyer's \nindependence of professional judgment or with the \nclient-lawyer relationship; and \n(3) information relating to representation of a \nclient is protected as required by Rule 1.6 \n[Confidentiality of Information]. \nMODEL RULES OF PRO. CONDUCT r. l.8(f) (AM. BARAss'N 2022) (emphasis \nadded). These rigid requirements are critical \"[b ]ecause third-party payers \nfrequently have interests that differ from those of the client .... \" Id. at r. 1.8(f) \ncmt. Thus, \"lawyers are prohibited from accepting or continuing such \nrepresentations unless the lawyer determines that there will be no interference with \nthe lawyer's independent professional judgment and there is informed consent \nfrom the client.\" Id. ( emphasis added). \nLike Mr. Hall in Nimitz's cases, Mr. Bui appeared to have had no \ncommunication with Mellaconic' s lawyers before the complaints were filed, before \nsettlements were reached, and before voluntary dismissals of the cases were filed \nin this Court. D.I. 26 at 91 :17-93:18, 101 :7-102:3. I did not, and do not as of this \ndate, understand how, in the absence of direct communication with Mr. Bui, \nMellaconic' s lawyers could have determined that Mellaconic gave informed \nabout the material risks of and reasonably available alternatives to the proposed \ncourse of conduct.\" MODEL RULES OF PRO. CONDUCT r. l.0(e) (AM. BARASS'N \n2022). \n72 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 74 of 80 PageID #: 587consent to the initiation and settlement of the lawsuits brought in Mellaconic' s \nname in this Court. For that reason, I was and remain concerned that Messrs. \nChong and Curfman (and now, Wernow) did not act consistent with their \nprofessional obligations under the Model Rules. \nThe Consulting Agreement also added to my concerns about Mavexar' s role \nin these cases and whether the assignment of the #328 patent to Nimitz recorded in \nthe PTO was a fiction. The Consulting Agreement between Mavexar and \nMellaconic looks to be a form agreement, and it provides that \"the Client\"-in this \ncase, Mellaconic-\"agrees to maintain clear and exclusive title to the Patents, and \nnot incur any liens, encumbrances, or third[-]party claims with respect to the \nPatents.\" Nov. 4, 2022 Hr'g, Ex. 3 at\u00a7 1. IfNimitz had a similar provision in its \nagreement with Mavexar, that provision would seem to call into question the \nvalidity of the assignment filed by an IP Edge email accountholder in the PTO that \npurported to transfer to Nimitz all right, title, and interest in the #328 patent. \nXI. \nI made this statement at the conclusion of the November 4 hearing: \nI think the testimony has to give pause to anybody who \nreally is concerned about the integrity of our judicial \nsystem, the abuse of our courts, and potential abuse, lack \nof transparency as to who the real parties before the \nCourt are, about who is making decisions in these types \nof litigation. But it's a lot to digest, and I may ask for \n73 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 75 of 80 PageID #: 588supplemental briefing. I'm actually considering inviting \namici to come in to help. And I would be open to \nreceiving recommendations for amici. \n. . . If you have any recommendations for amici, \nplease submit them no later than a week from today. \nAnd the cases are going to remain where they are, as I \nconsider these issues. \nD .I. 26 at 107: 14-108 :3. I did not think it necessary to repeat at the hearing's \nconclusion the concerns I had raised earlier in the hearing about whether counsel \nhad acted consistent with the Rules of Professional Conduct. \nBelieving that I needed more information to decide whether further action \nwas warranted to address these concerns and also to address counsel's admitted \nfailures to comply at the very least with the Disclosure Order, if not also the Third\u00ad\nParty Funding Order, I issued on November 10 the Memorandum Order. \nThe Memorandum Order requires Nimitz, Mark Hall, and Mr. Pazuniak's \nfirm to \"produce to the Court\" (1) their communications with Mavexar and IP \nEdge regarding (a) Nimitz's formation, acquisition of patents, and potential \nliability for asserting those patents in these cases, (b) the #3 28 patent, and ( c) the \ninitiation and settlement of the cases Nimitz filed in this Court; (2) retention letters \nand/or agreements between Nimitz and Mr. Pazuniak's firm; (3) monthly bank \nstatements for any and all bank accounts held by Nimitz for the time period during \nwhich it filed the 11 complaints asserting infringement of the #328 patent in this \n74 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 76 of 80 PageID #: 589Court; and (4) documents relating to Nimitz's use, lease, purchase, and/or retention \nof 3333 Preston Road, STE 300, #1047, Frisco, TX 75034-the address alleged in \nNimitz's complaints to be its principal office. The Memorandum also requires \nMark Hall to submit an affidavit in which he identifies the assets owned by Nimitz \nas of the dates it filed the complaints in these four actions. \nNotably, the Memorandum Order does not require Nimitz to docket these \nrecords or otherwise make them public. Thus, Nimitz is free to submit and to \npublicly file at the time of its production of the records in question an assertion that \nthe records are covered by the attorney-client privilege and/or work product \ndoctrine and a request that for that reason ( and perhaps other reasons) the Court \nmaintain the records under seal. \nThe records sought are all manifestly relevant to addressing the concerns I \nraised during the November 4 hearing. Lest there be any doubt, those concerns \nare: Did counsel comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct? Did counsel and \nNimitz comply with the orders of this Court? Are there real parties in interest \nother than Nimitz, such as Mavexar and IP Edge, that have been hidden from the \nCourt and the defendants? Have those real parties in interest perpetrated a fraud on \nthe court by fraudulently conveying to a shell LLC the #328 patent and filing a \nfictitious patent assignment with the PTO designed to shield those parties from the \n75 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 77 of 80 PageID #: 590potential liability they would otherwise face in asserting the #328 patent in \nlitigation? \nIt cannot be seriously disputed that I had the inherent authority to order the \nproduction of these records and to invite the parties to submit names of potential \namici to assist me in addressing the matters I have raised. \"It has long been \nunderstood that ' [ c ]ertain implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of \njustice from the nature of their institution,' powers 'which cannot be dispensed \nwith in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.\"' \nChambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991) (quoting United States v. \nHudson, 11 U.S. 32, 34 (1812)). \"These powers are 'governed not by rule or \nstatute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs \nso as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\"' Id. ( quoting \nLink v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1962)). \nThe Supreme Court has expressly held that a federal court's inherent powers \ninclude the powers I have exercised here: \"the power to control admission to its bar \nand to discipline attorneys who appear before it,\" id., the power to enforce \ncompliance with court orders, see id., and \"the power to conduct an independent \ninvestigation in order to determine whether [the court] has been the victim of \nfraud.\" Id. at 44. These powers extend to nonparties. See Manez v. Bridgestone \n76 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 78 of 80 PageID #: 591Firestone N Am. Tire, LLC, 533 F.3d 578, 585 (7th Cir. 2008) (\"No matter who \nallegedly commits a fraud on the court-a party, an attorney, or a nonparty \nwitness-the court has the inherent power to conduct proceedings to investigate \nthat allegation and, if it is proven, to punish that conduct.\"); Corder v. Howard \nJohnson & Co., 53 F.3d 225, 232 (9th Cir. 1994) (\"[E]ven in the absence of \nstatutory authority, a court may impose attorney's fees against a non party as an \nexercise of the court's inherent power to impose sanctions to curb abusive \nlitigation practices.\" ( citations omitted)). And the Supreme Court has expressly \napproved the use of amici to help courts exercise these powers. See Universal Oil \nProd. Co. v. Root Ref Co., 328 U.S. 575, 580-81 (1946) (\"[A] court that \nundertakes an investigation of fraud upon it may avail itself ... of amici to \nrepresent the public interest in the administration of justice.\"). \nThese powers \"must be exercised with restraint and discretion.\" Chambers, \n501 U.S. at 44. That is why I have proceeded incrementally-beginning with the \ntestimony of only the named owners of the LLC plaintiffs at the November 4 \nhearing and then issuing the Memorandum Order compelling the production of a \nlimited universe of documents directly relevant to the issues at hand. I have not \nmade definitive findings and will not make any adverse findings against a party \nwithout providing that party a full opportunity to be heard. \n77 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 79 of 80 PageID #: 592District judges can often point to a specific federal statute or the Federal \nRules to explain their actions. \"But if in the informed discretion of the court, \nneither [a] statute nor the Rules are up to the task, the court may safely rely on its \ninherent power.\" Id. at 50. I have so relied here. \nNovember 30, 2022 \n78 Case 1:21-cv-01362-CFC   Document 26   Filed 11/30/22   Page 80 of 80 PageID #: 593"}
