Andrews", "date": "04-08-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 21-1480-RGA\n\nNEW CASTLE COUNTY POLICE\nDEPARTMENT, et ai.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nShantell D. Newman, Wilmington, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nApril 8, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n. \u00a2\nANDREWS, (a rict Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Shantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis. (D.|. 5). She alleging civil rights violations pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 2). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff names a number of Defendants for actions that\nallegedly took place in 2014, 2017, and 2021. (D.I. 2 at 1-7). She claims violations of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution under the Equal Protection\nClause and alleges police used force to evict her. She also alleges that she was denied\nthe right to a fair trial when police and judges allowed photoshopped non-authenticated\nfake evidence that the State asked Plaintiff to provide. She seeks one billion dollars in\ndamages.\n\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a\ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir.\n2013). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must accept\nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to\n\na pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\n1\n\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, her\npleading is liberally construed and her Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be\nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d /d.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\n\nasserted. See id. at 11.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFor purposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as\npersonal injury actions. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985). In Delaware, \u00a7\n1983 claims are subject to a two-year limitations period. See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119;\nJohnson v. Cullen, 925 F .Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996). Section 1983 claims accrue\n\u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which its action is\nbased.\u201d Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia, 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\nThe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that generally must be raised\nby the defendant, and it is waived if not properly raised. See Benak ex rel. Alliance\nPremier Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P., 435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir.\n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon, 807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986). \u201cAlthough\nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua sponte dismissal is appropriate\n\nwhen \u2018the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual\n3\n\nrecord is required to be developed.\u201d Davis v. Gauby, 408 F. App\u2019x 524, 526 (3d Cir.\n2010) (quoting Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)). Accordingly a\ncourt may dismiss a time-barred complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n\nThe Complaint alleges wrongful acts that are identified as occurring in 2014 and\n2017 and maybe 2018. Plaintiff did not commence this action until October 22, 2021.\nHence, it is evident from the face of the Complaint that ail claims that accrued prior to\nOctober 22, 2019 are barred by the two year limitations period. They will be dismissed.\n\nWhile Plaintiff refers to 2021 as a date of occurrence, the Complaint does not\nconnect any of its myriad allegations as happening in 2021. It is not clear that any of\nthe allegations relate to 2021. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which claims\noccurred in 2014, 2017, or 2021. Defendants cannot properly respond to the complaint\nas pled. Therefore, the Complaint will be dismissed. Plaintiff will be given leave to\namend only those claims that accrued after October 22, 2019. Plaintiff needs to give at\nleast the approximate dates to which the allegations relate,\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). Plaintiff will be given leave to amend.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n"}
