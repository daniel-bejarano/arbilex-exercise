Appell ees2 filed proofs of claim in the Debtor\u2019s Chapter 11 case based on \nlitigation  claims  pending in the Nevada  state court  and the Delaware Court of Chancery .  Debtor filed  \nan objection to the proofs of claim , which included a motion to dismiss the claims based on Appellees \u2019 \nalleged lack of standing and failure to state a claim under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules  of Civil \nProcedure (A430-519) (\u201cClaim Objection\u201d) .  Following briefing of the Claim Objection and entry of \nan order confirming Debtor\u2019s plan , the Bankruptcy C ourt held a status conference on the Claim \nObject ion.  A few hours prior to the status conference, Appellees filed a motion  requesting, for the \nfirst time,  that the Bankruptcy Court abstain from adjudicating the Claim Objection pursuant to the \npermissive abstention doctrine set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1).  Without permitting Debtor the \nopportunity to be heard on the issue of  abstention, the Bankruptcy Court determined to  permissively \nabstain  from adjudicating the Claim Objection  and deny the Abstention Motion as moot .  For the \nreaso ns set forth herein, t he Court will affirm the Abstention Order.    \n  \n \n1  The docket of the chapter 11 cases, captioned In re Tonopah Sol ar Energy , LLC , Case No.  \n20-11884 (KBO) (Bankr.

BACKGROUND \n \nA. The Debtor  \nTonopah owns and operates a net 110- megawatt concentrated solar energy power plant \n(\u201cPlant\u201d) located near Tonopah in Nye County, Nevada.  (A0218) .  The Plant, also known as the \nCrescent Dunes Solar Energy Project  (\u201cProject\u201d), was to be the first utility -scale solar project of its \nkind in the U.S. to store energy as heat in the form of molten salt, effectively functioning as a giant \nbattery with the capability to generate electricity at night.  (Id.).  The development of the Project \ndepended on identifying a construction company that would assume the risks associated with the \nrequired engineering, procurement, and construction contract.  (A0219 ).  In September 2011, \nTonopah executed a contract with Cobra  Thermosolar  Plants, Inc. (\u201cCPI\u201d) to provide engineering, \nprocurement, and construction services in connection with the Project.  ( Id.).   \n The Project was funded through equity investments from an affiliate of SolarReserve, Cobra \nEnergy Investments, LLC ( \u201cCEI\u201d), which is an affiliate of ACS Servicios Comunicaciones y Energ\u00eda \nS.L. (\u201cACS\u201d and, together with CEI and CPI, \u201cCobra\u201d), and Banco Santander, S.A. (\u201cBanco Santander\u201d).  (Id.).  In addition, Tonopah and the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) entered into a  \nLoan Guarantee  Agreement , dated September 23, 2011 ( \u201cLGA\u201d), whereby the DOE guaranteed a \nproject loan made to Tonopah by the Federal Financing Bank ( \u201cDOE Loan\u201d).  (Id.).  In connection \nwith its obligations under the LGA, SolarReserve obtained $90 million in financing from CMB Group \nIX, which loan was memorialized in the \u201cGroup IX Loan Agreement.\u201d   (A0059- 60).  Tonopah is  not \na party to the CMB Group IX Loan Agreement.  ( Id.). \nAs of the p etitio n date, all of the equity interests in Tonopah were owned by nondebtor  \nTonopah Solar Energy Holdings II, LLC (\u201cTSEH II\u201d).  (A0226 ).  The equity interests  in TSEH II \nwere divided into two classes: Class A Units held solely by Capital One as a tax equity investor and \nClass B Units owned by non- debtor Tonopah Solar Energy Holdings I, LLC (\u201cTSEH  I\u201d).  (Id.).  TSEH 3 I was owned indirectly by Banco Santander (26.8%) and directly by non- debtor  Tonopah Solar \nInvestments, LLC (73.2%) (\u201cTSI LLC\u201d).  (Id.).  CEI and SolarReserve each held 50%  of TSI LLC.  \n(Id.).  Therefore , both CEI and SolarReserve were thrice removed remote, indirect owners  of \nTonopah, but neither was the holder of an equity interest directly in Tonopah. \nTonopah commenced commercial operation s and production at the Plant in November 2015.  \n(A0219) .  The electricity generated by the Plant was sold exclusively to the Nevada Power Company, \nd/b/a NV Energy (\u201cNVE\u201d) under a long- term power purchase agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d).  ( A0218) .  In late \nMarch 2019, the Plant\u2019s hot salt tank \u2013 an essential component in the  operation of the Plant  \u2013 \nexperienced a leak, which required Tonopah to halt all power  generating  operations at the Plant.  \n(A0222) .  Although CPI commenced repairs to the tank, the Plant was  unable to produce any \nelectricity beginning in April 2019, also ending Tonopah\u2019s  ability to generate revenue.  (Id.).  In \nSeptember 2019, DOE sent Tonopah a Notice of Events  of Default alleging that Tonopah was in \ndefault under the LGA.  ( A0223) .  NVE terminated the PPA in October 2019.  ( A0226) .   \nIn early 2020, facing liquidity issues, Tonopah, CPI, CEI, ACS Servicios Comunicaciones y \nEnerg\u00eda S.L. (\u201cACS\u201d), and the  DOE began  discussions regarding the compromise and settlement of \nthe DOE\u2019s claims for an agreed -upon reduced amount.  (A0227) .  Ultimately, following months of \nextensive arm\u2019s  length negotiations, Tonopah, CPI, CEI and ACS , with the support of the  DOE , \nentered into a  Restructuring  Support Agreement ( \u201cRSA\u201d), which provided that: (a) DOE would \nreceive, in full and  complete satisfaction of Tonopah\u2019s outstanding obligations under the L oan \nDocuments (as defined  in the LGA), a payment of $200 million in cash upon the effec tive date of the \nPlan, plus a $100  million contingent note to be guaranteed by Cobra  (as defined in the RSA) , with \nCobra funding Tonopah\u2019s obligations  under the Plan through new debt financing and cash to be \nprovided on the effective date of the  Plan; (b) the security interests granted under the Security \nDocuments (as defined in  the LGA) would be released; (c) the parties would enter into mutual, 4 consensual releases of all  claims against each other on the terms set forth in the Plan; (d) Cobra or an \naffilia te thereof would own 100% of Tonopah upon completion of the restructuring; and (e) all other \nclaims would  remain unimpaired as set forth in the Plan.  \nB. Chapter 11 Case  \n \nOn July 30, 2020 (\u201cPetition Date\u201d), Debtor  commenced a voluntary case  under chapter 11 the \nBankruptcy Code.  The same day, Debtor  filed a proposed plan (A0145-201) (as amended , \u201cPlan\u201d) , \nwhich embodied the terms of the RSA, along with a related disclosure statement ( A0202 -368).  \nAppellees  filed objections to various  requests for relief filed  by Debtor , including to Debtor\u2019s  \nconsensual use of cash collateral and approval of its  Disclosure Statement (both of which were  \noverruled by the Bankruptcy Court), and also served multiple and voluminous discovery requests on \nTonopah.  ( A0001- 12, A0037- 48).  Ap pellees\u2019  standing to participate in the chapter 11 case was \nchallenged by Tonopah and questioned by the Bankruptcy Court throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.  ( See, e.g. , A0013- 36) (\u201c8/24/20 Tr. \u201d at 20:3- 7 (\u201cSolar Reser ve\u2019s . . . standing . . .  to be \nheard in connection with this matter seems  to be questionable at best[.]\u201d);  A0369- 0412 (\u201c9/4/20 Tr.\u201d)  \nat 39:3- 5 (\u201c[Appellees ] don\u2019t have standing to object to the disclosure statement in their capacity as \na remote investor and non- voting party[.].\u201d).  \nC. Proofs of Claim  and Underlying Litigation  \nDespite the fact that no bar date was set  for proofs of claim \u2014as all creditors with the exception \nof DOE  were unimpaired under the proposed plan\u2014Appellees  filed proof s of claim  in the chapter 11 \ncase.  CMB Group IX and CMB Export filed proofs of claim on September 3, 2020 (\u201cCMB Proofs of Claim\u201d) and SolarReserve filed a proof of claim on September 22, 2020 (\u201cSolarReserve Proof of Claim\u201d and collectively with the CMB Proofs of Cla im, the \u201cProofs of Claim\u201d).  ( A0049 -96, 97- 144 \n& 413- 29).  CMB\u2019s proofs of claim asserted a general unsecured claim against Tonopah in the amount \nof $90 million based upon a complaint (as amended, \u201cNevada Complaint\u201d) filed on May 19, 2020 in 5 Nevada state court against Cobra, certain Cobra  affiliates, and Tonopah, among others  (\u201cNevada \nAction\u201d) .  On February 9, 2021, Cobra Finance, CEI, CIS, CPI, Cobra Instalaciones, ACS, and Banco \nSantander removed the Nevada Action to the Uni ted States District Court for the District of Nevada \n(\u201cNevada District Court\u201d).  CMB Infrastructure Group IX, LP, et al. v. Cobra Energy Investment \nFinance, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:21- CV-00214- JAD-DJA (D. Nev. 2021)  (\u201cNevada Action\u201d).   \nThe crux of allegations in the Amended Complaint is that the Project was beset with \nsignificant difficulties from inception due to the actions of CPI, the construction contractor, ultimately \nleading to the Project\u2019s failure to meet its electrical power generation requ irements under the PPA, \ntermination of the PPA, and SolarReserve\u2019s inability to repay the CMB Loan.  ( Id. A0060).  \nAccording to Appellees, \u201c[t]he Project\u2019s failure is due almost entirely to [CPI and its] affiliates,\u201d \nspecifically because \u201c[CPI] partially constructed and prematurely delivered a grossly defective, non-functioning power plant.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 5).  Appellees  allege that CPI \u201cthereafter engaged with its parents \nand affiliates in a complex scheme designed to shift blame to SolarReserve and to shield the mselves \nfrom responsibility,\u201d which included \u201cmisrepresenting the Project\u2019s condition to [CMB] and withholding from them information that would have enabled [CMB] to undertake efforts to mitigate \nor avoid their losses caused by SolarReserve\u2019s failure to re pay its indebtedness.\u201d  (Id.)  Appellees  \nasserted several claims against Tonopah in the Complaint, including: (i) fraud; (ii) aiding and abetting fraud;  (iii) aiding and abetting interference with the Group IX Loan Agreement; (iv) intentional \ninterference with contractual relations; and  (v) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.  \nSolarReserve\u2019s proof of claim asserted a general unsecured claim against Tonopah asserting \nunliquidated monetary damages based upon a nonmonetary action (\u201cBooks and Records A ction\u201d) \nfiled by SolarReserve against Tonopah in the Delaware Court of Chancery on February 5, 2020, \nseeking to enforce its alleged contractual right to inspect Tonopah\u2019s books and records .  (A0422- 29).  \nPrior to Tonopah\u2019s bankruptcy filing, however, after a one- day bench trial, the Court of Chancery 6 resolved the a ction in Debtor\u2019s  favor, holding that  SolarReserve could not enforce its purported \ninspection rights because (a) it had assigned all  claims it had against Tonopah to CMB, and \n(b) Tonopah\u2019s operating agreement expressly denied information rights to \u201cunaffiliated successors\u201d \nsuch as CMB.  SolarRes erve CSP Holdings, LLC v. Tonopah Solar Energy, LLC , 2020 WL 4251968, \nat *5 -6 (Del. Ch. July 24,  2020).  The decision was on appeal at time of the confirmation hearing .   \nD. Claim Objection  \nOn October 1, 2020, Debtor  filed its Claim Objection  (A430-519) (\u201cClaim Objection\u201d) \nseeking entry of  an order (a) determining that CMB and SolarReserve lacked standing in the C hapter \n11 case and  (b) disallowing the P roofs of C laim for lack of standing and failure to state a claim under \napplicable law against  Debtor .  The Claim Objection was fully briefed.  (A0520- 548;. A0549- 665).  \nOn October 27, 2020, t he Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Claim Objection ( A0666- 89) \n(\u201c10/27/20 Tr.\u201d).  T he court indicated that it would not be able to render a decision on the Claim \nObjection prior to the start of Plan confirmation  proceedings.  (Id. at 8:2-9 (\u201cI need more time to  fully \ndigest the merits of the issues that have been raised and I\u2019m not confident that I\u2019m going to be able to \nrender a ruling in a sufficient time to  allow for the confirmation proceedings to go forward on the \ncurrent timetable if the parties were to wait for my ruling[.]\u201d) ).  The court also repeated its prior \nrulings regarding Appellees\u2019 limited standing as a creditor and not as  an indirect equity hol der, stating \nthat even if Appellees held valid claims against the Debtor , \u201cthey  are unimpaired under the plan\u201d and \ndid not possess standing to object to the portions of the Plan that did not affect their direct interests.  \n(See id. at 8:24\u201310:5).  At the B ankruptcy Court\u2019s suggestion, Debtor  and Appellees agreed to \ncontinue the hearing on the Claim Objection until a date after confirmation.  (Id. at 16:9- 23).  At no \ntime before, after , or during the  October 27 hearing, until Appellees\u2019 late filing of their Abstention \nMotion months later and just hours prior to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s sua sponte determination to \nabstain, did Appellees or the c ourt raise the issue of abstention. 7 E. Confirmation of the Plan and Related Appeal  \n \nOn November 6, 2020, Appellees file d a plan objection (A0689- 710) (\u201cConfirmation \nObjection\u201d).  Despite  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s prior ruling regarding the permissible scope of \nobjections that could be raised by Appellees as, at most, unimpaired claim holders, the  Confirmation \nObjection included a litany of challenges  including that: (i) the Plan did not meet the feasibility \nrequirement of \u00a7  1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code; (ii) notwithstanding the express terms of the \nPlan, unsecure d creditors were impaired under the Plan and therefore entitled to vote; (iii) the Plan \nwas not proposed in good faith as required by \u00a7 1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code; (iv) the Plan did \nnot satisfy \u00a7 1129(a)(7)\u2019s best interests test because creditors wo uld fare better under a liquidation of \nTonopah; (v) the Plan releases and exculpation were overbroad; and (vi) Tonopah failed to identify \ncontracts it sought to assume.  Given the court\u2019s prior ruling, a  dispute arose regarding the scope of \nexpert witness testimony.  (A0565- 0612 (\u201c11/16/20 Tr.\u201d)  at 3:8-17).  Based on their status as \nunimpaired, unsecured creditors, Tonopah argued Appellees  lacked standing to challenge the \nreasonableness of the settlement embodied in the Plan, as well as whether the Plan  satisfied the best \ninterests of creditors test, was proposed in good faith, and included releases that  were overbroad, as \nthose provisions  did not impact Appellees\u2019  treatment and ultimate  recovery or were inapplicable .  (Id. \nat 9:20- 12:11) .  Tonopah reques ted that court  limit the scope of Appellees\u2019  expert testimony.  (Id. at \n12:12- 21).  The court agreed and ruled  that Appellees\u2019  expert testimony must be limited to  feasibility .  \n(Id. at 18:5- 11; see also  37:4- 25; 38:1- 7). \nOn November 20, 2020 ( A0613- 0832) (\u201c11/20/20 Tr.\u201d) and December 3, 2020 ( A0833- 0932) \n(\u201c12/3/20 Tr.\u201d), t he Bankruptcy Court held a two- day hearing (\u201cConfirmation Hearing\u201d).  As  the \nresult of mediation sessions conducted by the  Honorable Brendan L. Shannon at Judge Owens\u2019 \nsuggesti on, Tonopah and Cobra presented enhancements to the Plan made for the benefit of \nAppell ees: Cobra agreed to (i) provide a $6 million irrevocable letter of credit (\u201cCMB/SR Letter of 8 Credit\u201d) in favor of Appellees  as a reserve to be drawn on in the event tha t Appellees  obtain a final, \nnon-appealable judgment against  Tonopah in the Nevada Action or the Books and Records Action;  \nand (ii) increase the post -effective date w orking capital facility  by $14 million (to a total of $64 \nmillion) .  (See 12/3/ 20 Tr. at 6:18- 25; 7:1- 21).   \nAt the conclusion of the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the Plan, as \nmodified  by these enhancement s, satisfied each of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s  confirmation standards  (id. \nat 93:9- 15) and subsequently entered an order confirming the Plan on December 9, 2020  (A1079 -\n1235) (\u201cConfirmation Order\u201d).  The Plan went effective on December 18, 2020.  (A1236- 38).  On \nDecember 23, 2020, App ellees filed a timely notice of appeal of the Confirmation Order .  (D.I. 1).   \nF. Status Conference and Abstention Order  \nOn January 12, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court held a status conference on the Claim  Objection \n(See A1548 -65) (\u201c1/12/21 Tr.\u201d ) (\u201cStatus Conference\u201d) .  Just hours before the Status  Conference, \nAppellees filed the Abstention Motio n, requesting that the Bankruptcy Court abstain from \nadjudicating the Claim Objection pursuant to the permissive abstention doctrine set forth in 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1334(c)(1).  Appellees asserted  that the court had nothing lef t to administer in light of entry of the \nConfirmation Order.  Appellees did not notice the Abstention Motion for a hearing.   \nThe Bankruptcy Court began  the Status Conference by acknowledging that the Claim \nObjection had been fully briefed and requested that Tonopah and Appellees provide an overview of \nwhere the Claim Objection stood.  (1/12/21 Tr. at 4:3-15).  The Claim Objection was fully briefed \nand ready for argument, and, until the morning of the Status Conference, and Debtor was prepared to \nrequest a hearing for the Claim Objection.  (See id. at 4:16\u20138:23) .  Debtor  advised the Bankruptcy \nCourt that although it was not prepared to address the substance or merits of abstention, it believed \nthe arguments in the Abstention Motion were flawed and ignored various bankruptcy- related  matters \nthat would be impacted by adjudication of the Claim Objection.  (Id.).  The Bankruptcy Court stated 9 that it had seen the Abstention Motion but assured Tonopah that it did not need argument \u201con anything \nwith respect to the abstention request [at the Status Conference].\u201d   (Id. at 6:17- 20).  Both Tonopah \nand Appellees informed the Bankruptcy Court that they were open to scheduling the hearing on the \nAbstention Motion at the same time as the Claim Objection.  ( Id. at 8:11- 23, 11:4- 7). \nThe Bankruptcy Court noted it  \u201ccould avoid some further briefing and discussion [on the \nissues between the parties]\u201d by providing its thoughts on how to move forward with the  Claim \nObjection and underlying actions.  (Id. at 12:12- 15).  First, the Bankruptcy Court declined to construe  \nthe Claim Objection as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under applicable law pursuant \nto Rule 12 of the  Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure, which the  Bankruptcy Court has discretion to \nconsider pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9014.  (Id. at 12:16- 21).  The Bankruptcy Court stated that it  \nmay have considered the Rule 12 issues raised by the Claim Objection prior to confirmation if \nsufficient time was provided, but it  did not believe  consideration of the Claim Objection post -\nconfirmation would be an efficient use of time.  ( Id. at  12:21- 25; 13:1- 5). \nSecond, notwithstanding that the Bankruptcy Court did not hear argument on permissive  \nabstention, and that it had directed the parties to hold any such arguments in abeyance, the Bankruptcy \nCourt sua sponte determined to abstain from adjudicating the Claim Objection.  (See id. at 12:16 \u2013\n14:23) .  Specifically, with respect to the Nevada Action, the Bankruptcy Court reas oned that  it was \nbased entirely on state law and involved overlapping questions of fact and law that need to be \nanswered for both Debtor  and the non- debtor parties.  (Id. at 13:18- 23).  The Bankruptcy Court further \nstated that there  were no bankruptcy reas ons necessitating the piecemeal adjudication of the Nevada \nAction.  (Id. at 13:25\u201314:2 ).  Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court directed the parties to submit a  \nproposed form of order consistent with its ruling.  (Id. at 14:8- 13).  On February 1, 2021, the \nBankruptcy Court entered the Abstention Order.  On February 16, 2021, Debtor  filed a notice of 10 appeal with respect to the Abstention Order, thereby commencing this a ppeal.  (D.I. 1).  The appeal \nis fully briefed.  (D.I. 10- 13). \nG. Status of Litigation Underlying the Proofs of Claim  \n1. Nevada Action  \nThe docket of the Nevada Action reflects that, o n March 11, 2021, Appellees  filed a Motion \nto Remand  the action to Nevada state court.  On March 11, 2021, various Cobra defendants  filed a \nMotion to Compel Arbitration (id., D.I. 24) in accordance with an arbitration clause  contained in \nCobra Instalaciones y Servicios S.A.\u2019s guaranty of Cobra Energy Investment Finance, Inc.\u2019s \nperformance under a certain loan agreement , which requires  that any dispute arising in connection \nwith the guaranty must be finally resolved in the International Court of Arbitration of the International \nChamber of Commer ce, in accordance with ICC Rules of Arbitration .  On July 30, 2021, Tonopah \nfiled a M otion to Dismiss the Nevada Action  (id., D.I. 60 ).  On November 15, 2021, the Nevada \nDistrict Court issued an O rder (id., D.I. 70) , inter alia , (i) denying the Motion to Remand to Nevada  \nstate court ; (ii) granting the Motion to Compel  Arbitration , (iii) granting, in part, Tonopah\u2019s Motion \nto Dismiss  and dismissing with prejudice  Appellees\u2019 claim for aiding and abetting tortious \ninterference with contract , which is not cognizable under Nevada law ; and (iv) staying the entire \nNevada Action  pending the outcome of the arbitration (with the exception of certain  limited \njurisdictional discovery not relevant to this action) .   \n2. Books and Records Action  \nPrior to To nopah\u2019s bankruptcy filing, the Court of Chancery resolved the Books and Records \nAction in Debtor\u2019s favor, holding that SolarReserve could not enforce its purported inspection rights.  \nSolarReserve, 2020 WL 4251968, at *5- 6.  That  decision was on appeal at time of the confirmation \nhearing.  The Delaware Supreme Court later dismissed the appeal as moot.  SolarReserve CSP \nHoldings, LLC v. Tonopah Solar Energy, LLC , 258 A.3d 806 (Del. Aug. 9, 2021).

Del. 2016); In re SemCrude  L.P., 2012 WL 5554819, at *4 \n(D. Del. Nov. 15, 2012) (reviewing a  bankruptcy court\u2019s order regarding permissive abstention for \nabuse of discretion).  \u201cAbuse of discretion is found where a \u2018court\u2019s decision rests upon a clearly \nerroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law, or an improper application of law to fact.\u2019\u201d Energy Future Holdings , 558 B.R. at 686 (citing Int\u2019l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. \nImplement Workers of  Am., UAW v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 820 F.2d 91, 95 (3d Cir. 1987)). \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Permissive Abstention Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)  and the Bankruptcy Rules  \nSection 1334(c) of title 28 provides for abstention by the bankruptcy court from hearing a \nparticular bankruptcy proceeding.  The bankruptcy court determines whether it should exercise jurisdiction over a particular proceeding or, in the interests of comity and judicial economy, reli nquish \njurisdictio n.  The statute provides , in relevant part :  \n(c)(1) Except with respect to a case under chapter 15 of title 11, nothing in \nthis section prevents a district court in the interest of justice, or in the interest of comity with State courts o r respect for State law, from \nabstaining from hearing a particular proceeding arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title 11. \n(2) Upon timely motion of a party in a proceeding based upon a State law \nclaim or State law cause of  action, related to a case under title 11 but not \narising under title 11 or arising in a case under title  11, with respect to which \nan action could not have been commenced in a court of the United States  12 absent jurisdiction under this section, the district court shall abstain from \nhearing such proceeding  if an action is commenced, and can be timely \nadjudicated, in a State forum of appropriate  jurisdiction . \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)  (emphasis added).   \n \n Bankruptcy Rule 5011(b) governs a motion for abstentio n.  9 C OLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY  \n\u00b6 5011.02 (16th ed.).  A motion for abstention pursuant to \u00a7 1334(c)  is a contested matter  governed \nby Bankruptcy Rule 9014.  Fed. R. Bankr. P. 5011; 9 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY APP. 5011 ( reciting \n1991 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 5011).  Bankruptcy Rule 9014 governs contested matters and \nprovides that \u201c reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing shall be afforded the party against  whom \nrelief is sought.\u201d  Fed . R. Bankr. P. 9014(a).  \u201c The clear intention of Rule 9014 is that, when a response \nto a motion is filed, a hearing must be held in order to determine the contested matter; it is an abuse \nof discretion for the judge to grant the motion without holding such a hearing.\u201d  10 C OLLIER ON \nBANKR UPTCY  \u00b6 9014.03 ( 16th ed.). \nWith re spect to permissive abstention, however, a motion is not required  \u2013 the issue may be \nraised  by motion of a party, as discussed below, and it may also be raised by the Bankruptcy Court \nsua sponte.  Given the unusual procedural posture in which the Bankruptcy Court reached its abstained ruling here , it is unclear whether there was a \u201c contested matter \u201d before the Bankruptcy \nCourt that required \u201c reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing.\u201d   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(a).  It \nappears from the bench  ruling that the Bankruptcy Court  intended to raise permissive abstention sua \nsponte  at the Status Conference, received Appellees\u2019 request mere hours  before , but ultimately  viewed \nits permissive abstention as a sua sponte  decision \u2014not a s a grant of  the relief sought in the Abstention \nMotion.  Indeed , the  Abstention Order denies the Abstention Motion as \u201c moot.\u201d  In these \ncircumstances , the Abstention Order arguably does  not run afoul of Bankruptcy Rule  9014(a) . \n  13 B. The Bankruptcy Court May Raise  Permissive Abstention Sua Sponte  \nBased on the plain  language of \u00a7 1334(c)(1) , a bankruptcy court may raise permissive  \nabstention sua sponte .  Although \u201c[a] court may not apply the pri nciples of mandat ory abstention \nabsent a \u2018 timely motion of a party, \u2019 \u201cnothing prevents a bankruptcy court from considering the issue \nof permissive abstention sua sponte .\u201d  In re LTC Holdings, Inc., 587 B.R. 25, 29\u201330 (Bankr. D. Del. \n2018).  T he parties agree .  (D.I. 10 at 17; D.I. 12 at 39).   Debtor argues , however, that although the \nBankruptcy Court may raise abstention  sua sponte , it was an ab use of discretion for it to render its \nruling without allowing Debtor a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the issue \u2014notions of due \nprocess require notice and an  opportunity to be heard, Debtor asserts, even where abstention is raised \nsua sponte  by the Bankruptcy Court .   \nAccording to Debtor , courts have long recognized that \u201cthe requirement of notice is the \ncornerstone underpinning Bankruptcy Code procedure .\u201d  In re Grumman Olson Indus., Inc ., 467 B.R. \n694, 706 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Western Auto Supply Co. v. Savage Arms, Inc. (In re Savage \nIndus., Inc. ), 43 F.3d 714, 720 (1st  Cir. 1994) ).  Debtor contends  that t he notice requirements of \nbankruptcy law , which are  \u201cfounded in fundamental notions of procedural due pro cess,\u201d Western \nAuto  Supply , 43 F.3d. at 721, mandate that parties be afforded adequate notice and a m eaningful \nopportunity to be heard before their interests are adversely affected in a bankruptcy proceeding\u2014even where a court  is acting sua sponte .  Debtor cites the In re U.S. Mi neral Products decision , \nwherein this Court  held that the  bankruptcy court \u2019s sua sponte  appointment of a chapter 11 truste e \nwas not an abuse of discretion where parties were given  notice and a hearing .  2004 WL 115234, at \n*3 (D. Del. Jan. 16, 2004), aff\u2019d , 105 F. App\u2019x 428 (3d Cir. 2004).  Although the Court agrees with 14 these overarching principles , this case ( and several other s cited by Debtor ) do not  apply them in the \ncontext of permissive abstention.3 \nAppellees, for their part, are no help on this issue, as they appear to misconstrue Tonopah\u2019s \nargument to be that sua sponte  abstention is somehow impermissible.  ( See D.I. 12 at 39- 40).  Debtor \nacknowledges that bankruptcy courts have discretion to raise abstention  sua sponte , but argues that their \ndiscretion is not boundless \u2014\u201c[r]ather, bankruptcy courts must exercise this discretion within the confines \nof due process by affording parties notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to determining to abstain \nfrom exercising jurisdiction over a matter .\u201d  (D.I. 13 at 2).  Appellees do not argue to the contrary and \ncite no cases where a court considered and rejected the due process limitations on bankruptcy courts\u2019 \nability to abstain sua sponte .  To the contrary, i n Gober , a case cited by Appellees, the Fif th Circuit Court \nof Appeals disagreed with the appellant\u2019s argument that it was denied due process, but it reached this \nconclusion because the bankruptcy court had provided the appellant with \u201cample opportunity to brief [the] \nissue and present arguments in opposition to abstention, and [the appellant] did so in a  supplemental letter \nbrief submitted at the request of the bankruptcy judge.\u201d  Gober v. Terra + Corp. (In re Gober), 100 F.3d \n1195, 1207 n.10 (5th Cir. 1996). \nAs Debtor correctly argues, and as this  Court\u2019s own canvassing of case law has revealed, \nnumerous courts have held that although a bankruptcy court may permissively abstain from \nadjudicating a matter pursuant to \u00a7 1334(c)(1) sua sponte , it may do so only where the parties have \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue.  See, e.g., Stabler v. Beyers (In re Stabler) , 418 B.R. \n764, 769 (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[T]he procedure by which the issue [of abstention] came before the \n \n3  See D.I. 10 at 19 ( citing Meyers v.

New York , 547 F.2d 4, 5\u20136 & n. 4 (2d \nCir.1976)).  15 bankruptcy court is largely irrelevant, as long as  the Debtors h ad notice that the court was considering \nabstention\u201d); In re AFY, Inc., 539 B.R. 373, 378 (D.

Brownsburg \nHealthcare LLC (In re Kentuckiana Healthcare, LLC) , 2014 WL 906121, at *3 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 7, \n2014) (\u201cThe question of permissive abstention may be raised by this court sua sponte , as long as the \nparties have an opportunity to be heard.\u201d); Vernell v. Washington Mutual Bank, F.A. (In re Vernell) , \n2008 WL 434718, at  *1 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. Feb. 13, 2008) (same).  In In re LTC Holdings, Inc., for \nexample, the bankruptcy court considered permissive abstention sua sponte only after providing the \nparties an opportunity to brief their positions.  LTC Holdings, Inc., 587 B.R. at 29 .4  These cases , \nthough highly persuasive , are not  binding on this  Court. \nWe cannot fault Debtor for failing to cite a  Third Circuit case in support of its due process \nargument .  Th at there is little guidance from the Third Circuit on this is sue is to be expected, given \nthat a court of appeals has no jurisdiction to review the application of discretionary abstention.  See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d) ; In re Federal  Mogul, Inc ., 300 F.3d 368, 389 n.14 (3d Cir. 2002) .  As for courts \nwithin  the Third C ircuit, many have determined to permissively abstain  without noti ce and hearing  \nbut also without analysis of the due process issue , citing only the well -settled propositi on that a \nbankruptcy court may raise abstention  sua spont e; of those  cases , notably, many cite  the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s  Gober  decision for support \u2014the  same decision  which rejected appellant\u2019s  due process \n \n4  See also In re Southmark Assocs.

Pa. 1999)  (relying on Gober ); \nBricker  v. Martin, 348 B.R. 28, 33- 34 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 2006)  (same) ; In re Vanhook , 468 B.R. 694, \n700 (Bankr. D.

For example, \nAppellees cite the Old Augusta decision  for its proposition that \u201c[i]t is widely accepted that a court \nmay act sua sponte to remand a case on grounds of pe rmissive abstention pursuant to Section \n1334(c)(1).\u201d  (See D.I. 12 at 39 (citing In re Old Augus ta Dev. Group, Inc ., 2011 WL 2632147, at *3 \n(Bankr. S.D. Ga. May 16, 2011) )).  But Old Augusta  also relies on Gober , among other cases .  See \nid. \nAppellees point out  that, \u201c[u]nlike mandatory abstention, the motion requirement is \nconspicuously absent from the permissive abstention statute.\u201d  (D.I. 12 at 39).  Permissive abstention \nunder \u00a7 1334(c)(1) contains no requirement for a motion.  M andatory abstention under \u00a7 1334(c)(2) , \non the other hand, does requires a motion\u2014and such a motion initiates  a contested matter and trig gers \nthe notice and hearing requirements of Bankruptcy Rule 9014.  Although the Court certainly views it \nas a best practice to give the affected  party notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on \npermissive abstention , the Court will not create such a requirement where none exists .  Accordingly, \nthe Court  will decline to find that the Bankruptcy Court abused its disc retion on t he basis that it did \nnot permit Debtor an opportunity to be heard.  \nC. No Abuse of Discretion in Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Consideration of Permissive \nAbstention Factors  \n \nPursuant to the permissive abstention doctrine in \u00a7  1334(c)(1), a bankruptcy court  may, in its \ndiscretion, abstain from hearing a proceeding \u201cin the interest of justice, or in the  interest of comity \nwith State courts or respect for state law.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1).  As the Third Circuit has explained, \n\u201c[f]ederal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the  jurisdiction conferred on 17 them.\u201d  In re SCH Corp., 569 F. App\u2019x 119, 121 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting In re Semcrude, L.P., \n728 F.3d 314, 320 (3d Cir. 2013)).  Accordingly, permissive abste ntion \u201cis  the exception, not the rule.  \nIt rarely should be invoked.\u201d  In re Penson Worldwide , 587 B.R. 6, 22 (Bankr. D. Del. 2018 (citing \nGwynedd Props., Inc. v. Lower Gwynedd Twp., 970 F.2d 1195, 1199 (3d Cir. 1992)) ).  In deciding \nwhether permissive abs tention is proper, courts typically utilize a  twelve -factor test: \n(1) the effect or lack thereof on the efficient administration of the  \nestate; (2) the extent to which state law issues predominate over  \nbankruptcy issues; (3) the difficulty or unsettled nat ure of the  \napplicable state law; (4) the presence of a related proceeding  \ncommenced in state court or other non- bankruptcy court; (5) the  \njurisdictional basis, if any, other than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334; (6) the  \ndegree of relatedness or remoteness of the proceedi ng to the main \nbankruptcy case; (7) the substance rather than the form of an \nasserted \u201ccore\u201d proceeding; (8) the feasibility of severing state law  \nclaims from core bankruptcy matters to allow judgments to be  \nentered in state court with enforcement left to the bankruptcy court;  \n(9) the burden on the court\u2019s docket; (10) the likelihood that the  \ncommencement of the proceeding in bankruptcy court involves  \nforum shopping by one of the parties; (11) the existence of a right to a jury trial; and (12) the presence in the proceeding of  non-debtor  \nparties.  \n \nSee, e.g., Continental  Airlines,  Inc. v. Allen  (In re Continental  Airlines,  Inc.),  156 B.R. 441, 443 \n(Bankr.  D. Del. 1993).  The evaluation of these factors is not \u201cmerely a mathematical exercise.\u201d  Trans  \nWorld  Airlines,  Inc. v. Karabu Corp. (In re Trans  World  Airlines,  Inc.), 196 B.R. 711, 715 (Bankr.  \nD. Del. 1996).  Rather, courts apply these factors  flexibly, and some factors are weighed more heavily \nthan others.  Of particular importance are the effect on the administration of the estate, whether the \nproceeding is core or non -core, and whether the claim involves only state law issues.  See In re Welded \nConstr., L .P., 609 B.R. 101, 112 (Bankr. D. Del. 2019); Republic  Underwriters Ins. Co. v. DBSI  \nRepublic, LLC (In re DBSI,  Inc.), 409 B.R. 720, 729 (Bankr.  D. Del. 2009) .  Ultimately, the decision \n\u201cis left up to the broad discretion of the bankruptcy court.\u201d   DBSI,  Inc., 409 B.R. at 729; In re RNI \nWind  Down  Corp., 348 B.R. 286, 295 (Bankr.  D. Del. 2006)   (quoting Luan Inv. S.E. v. Franklin 145 \nCorp. (In  re Petrie  Retail,  Inc.) , 304 F.3d 223, 232  (2d Cir. 2002) ). 18 Because the Bankruptcy Court decided to abstain sua sponte , Debtor argues , the court  did not \nhave the benefit of Debtor\u2019s  analysis of the permissive abstention factors , and it abused its discretion \nby failing to consider certain factors  which weigh heavily in favor of  exercising jurisdiction over and \nadjudicating the Claim Objection .  (D.I. 10 at 21).  T o show abuse of discretion, Debtor must show \nthat the \u201ccourt\u2019s decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law, \nor an improper application of law to fact .\u201d  Energy Future Holdings , 558 B.R. at 686.  T he record \nreflects that , prior to the Status Conference, the Bankruptcy Court was  familiar  with the facts and \nissues raised in the Proofs of Claim and Claim Objection , having decided numerous motions for relief \nin the course of  the Plan confirmation proceedings arising from  same\u2014issues which , according to the \nBankruptcy Court, \u201chave  been discussed quite a bit throughout these proceedi ngs,\u201d indeed \u201cdiscussed \nad nauseum to date ,\u201d and which \u201cI fully understand and don\u2019t need further briefing on.\u201d  ( 1/12/21 at \n12:10- 13, 14:25, 15:1- 4).  \u201c[H]aving given a lot of thought to the path forward on the claims and \nrelated action, and to avoid further time delays and expenditures by the parties  on these issues\u201d ( id. \nat 12:2-8), the Bankruptcy Court determined to permissively abstain from adjudicating the Claim \nObjection, and provided a well-reasoned explanation  of the considerations supporting i ts decision , \nincluding that : (a) the court  did not believe that litigating the Proofs of Claim in the Bankruptcy Court \nwould be an efficient use of time; (b) the Nevada Action raised entirely state law issues; (c) there are non-debtor defendants in the Nevada Action and the claims against them overlap with those against \nTonopah; and (d) there was no bankruptcy reason necessitating the Bankruptcy Court \u2019s adjudicat ion \nof the Proofs of Claim ( id. at 13:18- 25; 14:1- 2).  Debtor has failed to show that any of the se findings \nare clearly erroneous.    \nEfficient administration of the estate ; degree of relatedness of the Claim Objection to the \nChapter 11 case.  With respect to these factors , Debtor argues that by filing the Proofs of Claim , \nAppellees \u201cinherently trigger[ed] one of the bankruptcy process\u2019s core features \u2014the claims  19 resolution process ,\u201d Welded Constr., 609 B.R. at 116, which is \u201c intimately related to the bankruptcy \nproceedings ,\u201d  Penson, 587 B.R. at 23 ( internal quotations omitted ).  (See D.I. 10 at 22).  Debtor \nfurther argues  that the Claim Objection would have resolved whether Appellees are creditors and thus \nhave standing to challenge the  Plan through the  Confirmation Appeal.   Appellees disagree.  Appellees \ndisagree that adjudicating the C laim Objection will have any impact on  the administration of the \nestate, as  the rights of unsecured creditors  (like Appellees ) are unimpaired  under the Plan .5  Appellees \nobjected to plan confirmation, on the basis that their claims would be impaired if the  reorganized \nDebtor did not generate sufficient revenue to satisfy a judgment in the Nevada Action, and they were \noverruled based on evidence of  the Debtor\u2019s  substantial financial backing, including the working \ncapital facility and letters of credit .  Accordingly, Appellees argue, abstention affects neither \nadministration of the estate nor  unsecured creditors\u2019 recovery , as the  Plan already  delineates their \nrecovery.  According to Appellees, Debtor\u2019s additional argument that the Claim Objection would \nmoot the Confirmation Appeal assumes Debtor\u2019s  success on the Claim Objection.  The Court agrees \nwith Appellees and finds  no error in  the Bankruptcy Court \u2019s finding that no bankruptcy reason \nnecessitat ed its adjudicat ion of  the Proofs of Claim .  Given the Plan\u2019s assurance that  Appellees \u2019 \nclaims passed through unimpaired to the reorganized Debtor , adjudicating  the Proofs of Claim  will \nhave no great effect on  administration of the estate and would not  constitute an efficient use o f time . \nWhether the matter is core or non -core.  A creditor \u201cwho invokes the aid of the bankruptcy \ncourt by offering a  proof of claim and demanding its allowance must abide the consequences of that \nprocedure.\u201d  Stern  v. Marshall , 564 U.S. 462, 496 (2011).  Here, Tonopah did not establish a bar date, \nand Appellees were not required to file their Proofs of Claim.  They never theless chose to  invoke the \n \n5  Plan \u00b6 5.4 ( \u201cGeneral Unsecured Claims are unimpaired Claims . . . each holder of an Allowed \nGeneral Unsecured Claim shall receive treatment that: (i) leaves unaltered the legal, equitable, \nor contractual rights to which the holder of such Allowed General Unsecured Claim is entitled; or (ii) otherwise leaves such Allowed General Unsecured Claim un impaired pursuant to \nsection 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d )  20 Bankruptcy Court\u2019s aid by \u201coffering a proof of claim and demanding its allowance,\u201d  and Debtor \nasserts that they \u201cmust abide the consequences of that procedure .\u201d  Id.    \nIn the Third Circuit, a proceeding is core \u201c(1) if it invokes a substantive right provided by title \n11 or (2) if it is a proceeding, that by its nature, could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.\u201d \nOfficial Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Integra ted Health Servs. v. Elkins (In re Integrated Health \nServs.) , 291 B.R. 615, 618 (Bankr. D. Del. 2010)  (finding that an adversary proceeding was not core \nbecause it was not dependent on any provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the allegations of breach \nof fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets were state law causes of action) (citations and internal \nquotations omitted) ).   \nDebtor is correct that allowance or disallowance of claims filed against the estate are \u201ccore\u201d \nbankruptcy matters.  28 U.S.C.  \u00a7 157(b)(2)(B) and (C).  But a  proceeding is not core simply because \nit is listed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b).  See DHP Holdings II Corp., 435 B.R. at 228 (Bankr. D. Del. 2010) \n(noting that an inquiry into whether a proceeding is core does not end because it is lis ted in 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 157(b)(2)(B) and that a court must examine if the proceeding invokes a substantive right provided by title 11 or if it could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case).   Appellees argue that, i n this \ncase, although the Claim Objection involves disallowance of claims  as is listed  in 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 157(b)(2)(B), Tonopah is really attempting to adjudicate the merits of the Nevada Action by seeking \ndisallowance of Appellees\u2019  claim s for failure to state a cause of action under Nevada state law and \nlack of standing.  The Claim Objection is neither dependent on any provision of the Bankruptcy Code \nnor is it a proceeding that could only arise in the context of a bankruptcy case.  Rather, t he direct \nclaims asserted against Tonopah\u2014which include fraud, tortious interference  with contract, breach of \ncontract \u2014are quintessential state law caus es of action. The Court agrees with Appellees that the \nsubstance of the Claim Objection is largely non- core.  21 The extent to which state law issues predominate over bankruptcy issues.   Debtor  concedes \nthat the Proofs of Claim are based on state law causes of  action.  Nonetheless, Debtor argues that,  \nwhile  state law issues may predominate, this factor is not dispositive because the state  law issues arise \nin the context of an objection to a proof of claim , and claim  reconciliation is a bankruptcy issue .  \nWhile  not typically the case, as already discussed, there is  no reason to a djudicat e the Proofs of Claim  \nin the Bankruptcy Court  in this  particular  case, and bankruptcy law has almost no substantive effect \non the outcome .  Rather , issues of state law predominate the Nevada Action , including whether \nAppellees state a claim under Nevada law .  The Court finds no error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding \nthat this dispute raises entirely  state law issues.  \nPresence of non -debtor defendants.  Regarding the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding that there are \nnon-debtor defendants in the Nevada Action, and that claims against them overlap with those against \nTonopah, this also supports abstention.  The  presence of non- debtor parties favors abstention when \nthe proceedings primarily involve claims asserted by or against non- debtors.  Burtch v. Seaport \nCapital, LLC (In re Direct Response Media, Inc.), 466 B.R. 626, 659 (Bankr. D. Del 2012) (citations \nomitted).  As Appellees correctly poi nt out , the Nevada Action is multi -party litigation, where \nTonopah is only one of eight defendants.  The Bankruptcy Court and Debtor  have acknowledged that, \ngiven the nature of the claims asserted in the Nevada Action and the theories of liability, it will  be \ndifficult to determine Tonopah\u2019s liability without adjudicating the liability of the other defendants who are not before the Bankruptcy Court.  Further, to the extent Appellees  are successful in the \nNevada Action, Tonopah has made clear that it will look to its co- defendants to bear the weight of \nthe damages sought.  In sum, a s there is no longer a bankruptcy purpose to  be served by adjudicating \nthe Claim Objection, a bstention will allow  the claims asserted against Tonopah to proceed in a single \nforum  and eliminate  unnecessary, duplicative litigation.  A bstention under these circumstances  22 comports with judicial economy, avoids the potential entry of inconsistent and unnecessary rulings, \nand curtails unnecessary expenditures of the parties . \nPresence  of related proceeding in state c ourt.  Debtor argue s that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \nexercise of jurisdiction over the Claim Objection is particularly appropriate given that the Nevada \nAction is no longer pending in Nevada state court .  But t he Nevada Action was pending in state court \nat the time the Bankruptcy Court entered the Abstention Orde r, and the later de velopment  provides \nno basis to disturb its abstention ruling.   \nJury trial.   Abstention is further favored when a party asserts its right to a jury trial and the \ncourt determining whether to abstain cannot provide one.  See LaRoche Indus., 312 B.R. at 255.  Appellees asserted the right to a jury trial in the Nevada Action against all of the defendants, including Tonopah, and the Bankruptcy Court cannot provide a jury trial absent the parties\u2019 consent.   \nIn sum, t he Court finds no clear error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings  in support  of its \ndetermination that case considerations weigh in favor of abstention.  The  more significant factors \nsupport abstention, and Debtor\u2019s  arguments as to the remaining factors do not  support a finding of \nabuse.\n6  The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to abstain under these circumstances fell well within its \ndiscretion.   \n \n6  According to Debtor, the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion by failing to specifically \nconsider each and every one of the permissive abstention factors .  (See D.I. 10 at 27 ( citing \nTurturici v. Nat\u2019l Mortg.  Servicing LP , 2010 WL 3212762, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2010) \n(\u201cThe record does not reveal that the bankruptcy court considered the [permissive] abstention factors when deciding to abstain in this case. \u2018[B]y failing to consider the[se] twelve [abstention factors], [t]he Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion[.]\u2019\u201d)) )  Debtor cites no \nauthority in this Circuit requiring the Bankruptcy Court to provide a detailed analysis of every factor in support of an abstention ruling. 23 D. No Abuse of Discretion in Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Determination Not to Consider \nWhether the Claim s Should be Disallowed for Failure to State a Claim  \n  Objections to proofs of claim are considered \u201ccontested matters\u201d governed by Bankruptcy \nRule 9014.  In re Lomas Fin. Corp., 212 B.R. 46, 52 (Bankr. D. Del. 1997).  Bankruptcy Rule  9014(c) \nprovides that c ertain rules set forth in Part VII of the Bankruptcy Rules governing adversary \nproceedings shall apply to contested matters.  Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(c).  Further, the  Bankruptcy \nCourt may apply one or more of the rules in Part VII of the Bankruptcy Rules not  expressly made \napplicable to contested matters by Rule 9014(c) at any stage of a contested matter .  Id.   Bankruptcy \nRule 7012 provides that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 applies in adversary proceedings.  \nFed. R. Bankr. P. 7012.  While not expressl y made applicable to contested matters, Bankruptcy Rule \n9014(c) provides the Bankruptcy Court with \u201cdiscretion to apply Bankruptcy Rule 7012 [and thereby \nFederal Rule 12(b)(6)] to a contested matter in the interest of judicial economy and the preservation of estate resources.\u201d  In re Energy Future Holdings Corp., 2021 WL 957301, at *5 n.1 (3d Cir. Mar. \n15, 2021).  Part VII of the Bankruptcy Rules is \u201cbased on the premise that to the extent possible practice before the bankruptcy courts and the district court should be the same.\u201d  Matter of Stavriotis , \n977 F.2d 1202, 1204 (7th Cir. 1992).  \u201cIn light of this rationale, even though bankruptcy courts are \nnot required to do so, many such  courts choose to apply Part VII bankruptcy rules to contested \nmatters.\u201d  Id.  \nAccordingly, t he Bankruptcy Court had discretion to direct that Rule 7012 appl ied to the \nClaim Objection a s a contested matter  but declined to do so.  (See 1/12/ 21 Tr. 12:19) .  According to \nDebtor, this ruling was  an abuse of discretion because  the Bankruptcy Court did not consider the \ninterests of judicial economy and preservation of estate resources that would be served by considering \nthe Claim Objection.   Specifically, t he Claim Objection was fully briefed, and the parties were \nprepared to move forward with a hearing on the Claim Objection , which might have  mooted the \nConfirmation Appeal.  According to Debtor, t he Bankruptcy Court  abused its discretion by f ailing to 24 consider these circumstances in its analysis of whether  application of Rule 12(b) to the Claim \nObjection was appropriate.  \nDebtor\u2019s  argument lacks merit.  The Bankrupt cy Court correctly noted that \u201cthe debtor\u2019s \npending motion and objection initiated . . . a contested matter and, u nder Rule 9014, the  [Bankruptcy] \nCourt is not required to consider a motion to di smiss under Rule 7012 in such a matter .  Whether or \nnot I do so is left to my discretion.\u201d  (1/12/21 Tr. at 12:16- 21).  Tonopah fails to cite a single case \nholding that the Bankruptcy Court was required to consider an objection to claim based on Rule 7012.  \nAt best, a bankruptcy court \u201cmay\u201d  direct that Rule 7012 apply to a contested matter \u2014which the \nBankruptcy Court justif iably declined to do. \nContrary to Debtor\u2019s assertions, although not required to do so, the Bankruptcy Court did \nconsider the interests of judicial economy and preservation of estate resources when entering the \nAbstention Order , among other considerations .  While t he Bankruptcy Court might have considered \nthe motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) prior to confirmation had there been sufficient time , it declined \nto do so post -confirmation \u201cfor a variety of reasons\u201d including that \u201cit may be an inefficient use of  \nmy time if ultimately, after considering the arguments presented, I find that [Appellees] should be \npermitted to amend their Nevada complaint.  And of course such a finding would also raise, I think, jurisdictional and other procedural questions given tha t the action is currently pending, albeit stayed, \nbefore a Nevada state court.\u201d  (1/12/21 Tr. at 12:23- 13:10).  The Bankruptcy Court noted that entry \nof the Abstention Order would \u201cavoid further time delays  and expenditures by the parties on these \nissues . . .\u201d ( id. at 12:7- 8) and stated that \u201cfor efficiency\u2019s sake, let\u2019s just get those actions restarted \nand get the parties focused on that\u201d ( id. at 14:21- 23).  \nThe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s well -reasoned explanation supports its exercise of discretion.  \nDebtor\u2019s argument \u2014that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s failure to c onsider the possible effect of the Rule \n12 motion on the pending C onfirmation Appeal  constituted an abus e of discretion \u2014is belied by the 25 record.  (See i d. at 15:20 -16:6; 16:19- 25).  That the parties were prepared to move forward with a \nhearing on a Rule 7012 motion  to dismiss \u2014which proceeding might possibly moot the Confirmation  \nAppeal \u2014and that this path was the Debtor\u2019s clear  preference, falls far short of demonstrating an abuse \nof discretion by the Bankruptcy Court . \nIV.
