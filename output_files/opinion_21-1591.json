BURKE, United States Magistrate Judge   \n As announced at the hearing on July 8, 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant \nHyphaMetrics, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cHyphaM etrics\u201d) motion to dismiss  (the \u201cmotion\u201d), (D.I. \n10), which argues that Plaintiff\u2019s The Nielsen Co. (US), LLC \u2019s asserted United States Patent No. \n8,924,994 is directed to non- patent -eligible subject matter pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (\u201cSection \n101\u201d) is DENIED.  \n Defendant\u2019s motion was fully briefed as of March 4, 2022, (D.I. 15), and the Court received further submissions regarding Section  101- related questions on July 1, 2022, (D.I. 40; \nD.I. 41).  The Court carefully revi ewed all submission s in connection with De fendant\u2019s motion , \nheard oral argument, and applied the relevant legal standards for review of this type of Section 101-related motion at the pleading stage, which it has previously set out in Genedics, LLC v. Meta Co., Civil Action No. 17-1062-CJB, 2018 WL 3991474, at *2-5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2018).    The Court\u2019s Order is consistent with the bench ruling announced at the hearing on July 8, 2022,\n1 pertinent excerpts of which follow:  \nThe next case is [T] he Nielsen Co. (US), LLC [ vs.]  HyphaMetrics, \nInc., Civil Action  Number 21-1591- CJB.  In this case, which is a \nconsent matter, before me is [D]efendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  \nThe motion is denied for the reasons I will set out now. \n \nPlaintiff asserts in its complaint that [D]efendant infringes claim 7 of United States Patent Number 8,924,994, which I will refer to as the '994 patent, and which is entitled \u201c Power Management for \nAudience Measurement Meters. \u201d  Claim 7 recites a method  \ncomprising measuring the power consumption of a  media \npresentation device (which the Court will refer to hereafter as a television),  determining that the television is on when the \nmeasured power consumption is greater than a first threshold, determining that the  television is off when the measured power  \nconsumption is less than a second threshold that [ is] different from \nthe first threshold (and I [ will] refer to these latter two limitations \n \n1  ( See D.I. 42) \n3 \n as the \u201c two-threshold element \u201d), and controlling activation of an \naudience measurement meter  based on the monitored activation \nstate of the  television, such that the meter will not  monitor the \ntelevision when the television is  off (I[ will]  refer to this last \nelement as the \u201c activation control element\u201d ).2   \n \nFirst, on the issue of representative  claims, while  Defendant \u2019s \nmotion is directed to  all of the claims in the '994 patent, Defendant  \nargues that claim 7 is representative of all  such claims.  Plaintiff \nretorts that because only claim 7 is asserted, the Court does [ not]  \nhave the authority to decide the eli gibility of  all claims of the '994 \npatent.  The Court need not definitively decide this issue.  It need  \nonly analyze claim 7, and based on its denial  of the motion with \nrespect to Defendant \u2019s purported representative claim, the Court \nwill therefore deny th e motion with respect to all claims of the '994 \npatent.  \n \nI[ will]  now turn to the Alice  analysis at  step one.  Defendant says \nthat claim 7 is  directed to the abstract idea of \u201c collecting  \nviewership data only when a television is  turned on[ .]\u201d3  The Court \nagrees that that is an  abstract idea.  [A] claim to an abstract idea  \nhas been described by the United States Court  of Appeals for the \nFederal Circuit as one directed to a \u201c\u2018disembodied \u2019 concept  . . . a \nbasic building block of human ingenuity, untethered from any real -\nworld application[ ,]\u201d4 and Defendant \u2019s abstract idea fits that \ncharacterization.  Indeed, Plaintiff does not  dispute that \u201c collecting \nviewership data only when a television is turned on\u201d  is an abstract  \nidea.  \n \nThe next question is whether claim 7 is  actually directed to that \nconcept  [of] \u201ccollecting  viewership data only when a television is  \nturned on.\u201d   Plaintiff argues that Defendant  has overgeneralized \nclaim 7.  According to Plaintiff, the difference between claim 7, as  \ncompared to the abstract idea, is that while  the abstract idea simply \nis collecting data  while the television is on, claim 7 is directed  to \nthe collection of data when the television  is on, utilizing a \nparticular way of  determining whether the televisio n is on\u2014that is, \nthrough the utilization of the  two-threshold element.5    \n \n2  (D.I. 1, ex. A (hereinafter, \u201c '994 patent\u201d), col. 22:29- 44) \n \n3  (D.I. 11 at 8)  \n \n4  CLS Bank Int\u2019l v. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd., 717 F.3d 1269, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2013) \n(Lourie, J., concurring) . \n \n5  (D.I. 13 at 6- 7) 4 \n  \nThe step one question is not clear -cut here.  The Federal Circuit \nhas indicated that a patent \u2019s specification can be helpful in  \nanswering the question of what a claim is  directed to.  For \nexample, if a claim contains  elements that are described by the \npatent \u2019s specification as being the innovation over the  prior art, or \nwhat the \u201c present invention\u201d  is all about, then it stands to reason \nthat the  claim probably is directed to that element or  concept.6  \nThat said, the Federal Circuit has  noted that reliance on the \nspecification in  determining the true focus of a claim must  always \nyield to the language of the claim in question.7 \n \nOn the one hand, one could argue, as  Defendan t does, that the '994 \npatent, as a whole , is directed to the concept of collecting \nviewership data only when a television is  turned on.  The title of \nthe patent helps  Defendant a bit on this front, as the patent is  \nbroadly titled \u201c Power Management for Audience  Measurement \nMeters \u201d (and does [ not]  specifically  reference the two -threshold \nelement).   Similarly, the Abstract of the patent explains  that \n\u201c[p]ower management methods, apparatus [] and  articles of \nmanufacture for audience  measuremen t meters are disclosed [,]\u201d \nsuch as a method that comprises \u201c determining an activation state \u201d \nof a television and \u201c controlling activation of an audience  \nmeasurement meter \u201d accordingly.8  In other  words [:]  collecting \nviewership data only when a  television is turned on.  And the first \nthree columns of the specification explain that prior  art audience \nmeasurement meters operated  continuously, which resulted in \nunnecessary and wasteful power consumption, since the  televisions \nthey were monitoring we re often  inactive for large periods of \ntime.9  The  specification also notes here that in some  prior \nsystems, an audience measurement meter \u2019s data would have to be \ndiscarded for an entire monitoring period if the meter lost power \nfor any duration, even a s hort one.10  In contrast to such prior art \nsystems, the specification  explains that the patent claims power  \n \n6  Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2016)  (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted) .   \n \n7  ChargePoint, Inc.  v. SemaConnect, Inc. , 920 F.3d 759, 766- 67 (Fed. Cir. 2019).   \n \n8  ('994 patent at 1)   \n \n9  (Id., cols. 1:12- 3:2)  \n \n10  (Id., col. 3: 19-33) \n 5 \n management methods that enable one to determine  the activation \nstate of a television and  control activation of an audience \nmeasurement  meter accordingly.11  Nor is the patent as a whole \ndirected to  any one single way of doing this.  Indeed, some  claims \n(like claim 1) appear to be fairly  agnostic as to how one determines \nwhether the  television is on.12   \n \nOn the other hand, we also have to look to claim 7 itself in assessing step one.  And  claim 7 is not a claim that simply recites a  \nmethod of collecting data when a television is  turned on, full stop, \nwhile being agnostic as  to how that is determined .  Instead, claim 7  \nreflects one particular way to monitor whether  the TV is on. \n \nMore specifically, it can be said that  claim 7 is made up of four \nclauses, and the  first three clauses are directed to describing  this \nparticular way .  The first clause tells us  that we [ are]  going to \nmeasur e power consumption of a television, and the next two \nclauses tell  us that we [ are]  going to determine whether the  \ntelevision is on utilizing the two -threshold element.  Finally, the \nlast clause of the claim  tells us to control the audience \nmeasurement  meter such that it is active when the  television is on.  \nSo it[ is] really only the last  clause of claim 7 that sounds a lot like  \nDefendant \u2019s abstract idea.  This reality might lead one to conclude \nthe claim is not simply  directed to that idea, but to a particular,  \nreal-world application of it.  \n \nOther issues seem to muddy the \u201c directed  to\u201d inquiry even further.  \nFor example, the way  that Plaintiff at times describes claim 7 in  its \nbriefing seems to mirror Defendant \u2019s abstract idea, such as when \nPlaintiff noted in  its answering brief at page 4 that \u201c [c]laim 7  \nprovides for an audience measurement meter that  is activated only \nwhen the power consumption of  a media presentation device that it \nmonitors  indicates that the media presentation device is  on.\u201d\n13  \nThat said, at other times, Plaintiff  characterizes the claim in a way \nthat makes it seem [like it is] more about the particular  two-\nthreshold element solution, such as on note  12 of page 13 of its \nanswering brief, where  Plaintiff describes the claim as one that  \n\u201crecites the control of the meter according to  the on/off state of the \n \n11  (Id., col. 2:12- 60) \n \n12  (Id., col. 21:31- 53) \n \n13  (D.I. 13 at 4)  \n 6 \n television as  determined by measuring power consumption using \nthe two [-]threshold approach.\u201d14 \n \nAdditionally, the specification does [ not]  say much about the \nparticula r two -threshold method and why it, in particular, improves \nupon prior art systems.  Indeed, it [ is] not until  column 8, line 3, \nthat the specification first  references the two -threshold element as \na possible way to determine whether the  television is on.15 \n \nSo in the end, the step one question is a  bit murky.  In Enfish, LLC, \nv. Microsoft Corp., the Federal Circuit said that in some cases  \ninvolving computer -related claims, there may be close calls about \nhow to characterize what the claims  are directed to, and that in \nthose  situations, a Court could analyze whether there  are arguably \nconcrete improvements in the  recited computer technology at \nAlice \u2019s step  two.16  In light of this, the Court will assume  arguendo \nthat claim 7 is directed to an  abstract idea, and will analyze \nwhether the  claim amounts to an improvement to computer  \ntechnology\u2014or otherwise contains an inventive concept \u2014at step \ntwo. \n \nStep two of the Alice  framework requires  the Court to assess what \nelse there is in the  claim beyond the abstract idea in order to \ndetermine whether the additional elements  transform the nature of \nthe claim into a  patent -eligible application of the idea.17  While  a \ndetermination of patent eligibility is  ultimately an issue of law, \nthere can be disputes regarding underlying facts, including whether \na claimed element or claimed  combination is well- understood, \nroutine, and conventional to a skilled artisan at the time  of the \npatent.18 \n In examining the claim at step two, the  Court will focus on the \ntwo-threshold element  rather than the activation control element,  \njust as Plaintiff largely did in its briefing.   That [ is] presumably \nbecause, as the Court  explained above, the activation control \nelement  sounds a lot like Defendant \u2019s abstract idea.   So it is the \n \n14  (Id. at 13 n.12)  \n \n15  ('994 patent, col. 8:3- 12) \n \n16  822 F.3d at 1339.   \n \n17  Alice  Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , 573 U.S. 208, 217- 18 (2014).  \n \n18  Berkheimer  v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1368- 69 (Fed. Cir. 2018).    \n 7 \n two-threshold element that might best be described as something \nthat goes beyond that idea and that could amount to the  inventive \nconcept here.  The Court will now  explain why, ultimately, it \nagrees with  Plaintiff that there is a fact dispute as to  whether claim \n7 of the '994 patent supplies an inventive concept that would \ntransform the idea  of collecting viewership data only when a  \ntelevision is on into a patent -eligible  application.  \n \nIn its briefing, Defendant  made a number  of arguments as to why it \nshould prevail at  step two, but the Court does not believe that  they [ \nare] well taken.    \n \nFor example, [D]efendant argued that  the two -threshold element \nfails to amount to an  inventive concept because it \u201cis just an  \nautomated way of doing the same thing a human could easily do by \nlooking to see [ if] the television is on.\u201d19  To this, though, Plaintiff  \nretorts that a human being could not mentally measure power consumption to de termine the  activation state of a television.\n20  \nThis seems  correct to the Court.  Plaintiff \u2019s complaint  attaches the \ndeclaration of Virginia Lee (which  the Court will refer to hereafter \nas the \u201c Lee declaration \u201d).21  Contrary to Defendant \u2019s assertion that \nthis declaration is  \u201cconclusory,\u201d22 the Court found the declaration \nas a whole to be fact -based and relevant to the  content of claim 7.  \nMs. Lee explains in  paragraph 9 of the declaration that power  \nconsumption is me asured in watts.  Defendant  fails to explain how \nthe human mind could measure watts, or how it could determine at any given moment whether the television consumption exceeded a \ncertain threshold, like 60 watts or  40 watts.  It seems to the Court \n[that] you need s ome mechanical way to measure power \nconsumption as  required by the two- threshold element.  Moreover, \nit seems clear that the claim and the  invention [are] meant to be \nused to figure out  whether a television is on over very lengthy and \nuninterrupted stretches of time.  As a  practical matter, no human \nbeing sits in front  of a television for 24 hours a day or close to it \n[in order] to determine whether that [television] is on.  You  need a \ntechnical, computer -based solution for  that, an d that [ is] why the \npatent asserts [one]  here.  \n \n \n19  (D.I. 11 at 19)   \n \n20  (D.I. 13 at 12)   \n \n21  (D.I. 1, ex. B ) \n \n22  (D.I. 15 at 9)  8 \n And while it is true that certain aspects  of the specification, \nincluding column 16, lines 14 to 16, generally state that certain  \nsteps of the various claimed methods could be  implemented \nmanually,23 these statements are not  clearly focused specifically on \nthe two-threshold element that[ is] required by claim 7.  So \n[D]efendant \u2019s \u201chuman analogue \u201d analogies do [ not] ring true.   \n \nNext, Defendant contended that the  two-threshold element simply \n\u201creflect [s] the abstract idea itself and require [s] only conventional \ncomputer functionality.\u201d24  As for the assertion that the two -\nthreshold element  simply reflects the abstract idea itself, the  Court \nis not sure how that [ is] so.  The  two-threshold element is a \nparticular way of  accomplishing the idea of collecting viewership \ndata only when a television is turned on (that  is, by measuring \npower consumption and by determining whether the power is on or off utilizing a compar ison of two thresholds).   \n And as for Defendant \u2019s assertion that the  two-threshold element \nonly requires  conventional computer technology, as Plaintiff  \nretorts, that [ is] not the test for patent  eligibility.  As the Federal \nCircuit explained  in cases like  Bascom Global Internet Services, \nInc.[] v. AT&T Mobility LLC , even if a  claim \u2019s limitations recite \ngeneric computer,  network, and [I]nternet components, an \ninventive  concept may still be found in how the  components are \nutilized and how they[ are] arranged with other components.\n25   \n \nDefendant \u2019s complaint that the  two-threshold element is not an \nadvancement in  computer technology seems to flow from its  \nassertion that the claim recites no  instructions, for example, about \nexactly how  power consumption is measured or how  either of  the \ntwo thresholds are determined.26  And it [ is] true, claim 7 does [ \nnot] explain this.  However,  the claim clearly does recite at least \none level of \u201c how. \u201d  It instructs one to compare  the measured \npower consumption of the  television to two different thresholds \n(where the television is considered to be on if the  power is greater \nthan the first threshold and the television is considered to be off if \nthe power is less than the second threshold), and to control the \n \n23  ('994 patent, col. 16:14- 16)  \n \n24  (D.I. 15 at 10; see also D.I. 41 at 2)    \n \n25  Bascom Global Internet Servs., Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341, 1349-\n50 (Fed. Cir. 2016) . \n \n26  (D.I. 15 at 4)   \n 9 \n audience measurement meter  accordingly.  From there, you can \nuse any known method for determining when a threshold is hit, and \nthe claim is silent as to which you use.   But that [ is] a claim to a \nspecific,  particularized way  to collect viewership data  only when a \ntelevision is turned on.  And to the extent that Defendant \u2019s \ncomplaint is that the specification does [ not]  say much about how  \nthe method gets done, as the Court noted earlier today, that might present a Section 112 issue, but not an eligibility issue under  \nSection 101.\n27 \n Lastly, in its reply brief, Defendant  further asserted that the two -\nthreshold element  is just a mathematical comparison, which itself  \nis an abstract concept that does [ not]  make the claim less abstract [.]  \n[B]ut because the defendant  did not raise this specific line of attack \nin its opening brief, Plaintiff did[ not]  have a chance to fairly \nrespond, and thus the Court  considers this argument to be waived.  \nNevertheless, even were it not waived, it is  not the case that the use \nof math in some way in a claim automatically renders the claim patent ineligible.  In Diamond v. Diehr , for example, the Supreme \nCourt found that a  computer implemented process for curing \nrubber, which employed a well -known mathematical  equation, was \npatent -eligible, because it used  the equation in a process designed \nto solve a  technological problem.\n28   \n In the end, for the reasons the Court has  explained here, \nDefendant \u2019s arguments are not  persuasive at step two.  Moreover, \nthe Court \u2019s decision here is also in line with Federal  Circuit \ncaselaw.   In explaining why this is so, the Court will discuss \nbriefly the cases [Defendant]  highlights as analogous to claim 7, \nexplain why they[ are] distin guishable, and also explain how they \nin fact help to show why Defendant \u2019s motion warrants denial.   \n \nDefendant identifies ChargePoint, Inc., v. SemaConnect, Inc.,\n29 as \nthe most similar case  to claim 7 here.30  In that case, the claims at  \nissue could be said to be similar to claim 7 in  the sense that they \nseem [ed] to comprise hardware  components and software \ncomponents that  communicate to turn charging stations on and \n \n27  Visual  Memory LLC v. NVIDIA Corp., 867 F.3d 1253, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2017) . \n \n28  Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175, 185- 87 (1981).   \n \n29  ChargePoint, Inc.  v. SemaConnect, Inc. , 920 F.3d 759 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  \n \n30  (D.I. 11 at 11- 12; D.I. 15 at 4- 5; D.I. 41 at 1)  \n 10 \n off.31  However, the two -threshold approach is a  distinguisher here, \nin that the claims in  ChargePoint  did not include a limitation that \nrecited a particular way  to accomplish this.  Rather, the \nChargePoint  Court noted that the  broad claim language in those \nclaims would  cover \u201cany mechanism \u201d for implementing network \ncommunication on a charging station, which would thus \n\u201cpreempt [] the entire industry \u2019s ability to use networked charging \nstations. \u201d32  Further, in that case, the specification was [ not]  \nhelpful to the patentee as it \u201c never suggests  that the charging \nstation itself is improve d from a technical perspective, or that it \nwould operate differently than it otherwise could\u201d  or that the \ninvention involved overcoming some  \u201csort of technical \ndifficulty [.]\u201d33 \n \nClaim 7, in contrast, would clearly not  preempt any method of \ncollecting viewership  data only when a television is turned on, \nsince it claims only one particular way of doing that.  For instance, \nclaim 7 does not preempt  controlling the audience measurement \nmeter  according to the audio output of the  television, which the \nLee declaration  recognizes in paragraph 16 (and which appears  to \nbe claimed, along with other things, in [c] laim 3 of the '994 \npatent [])[.]34  Nor would claim 7 preempt using a single threshold \nto determine  the activation state of a television, as  recognized in \nparagraph 23 of the complaint.35  Indeed, even Defendant \nacknowledges at page four of its reply brief that the patent  \nspecification describes other ways to determine whether a television is on.\n36 \n Defendant analogizes the \u201c two-threshold element \u201d to the \nutilization demand response  principles in certain claims that were \nat issue  in ChargePoint .  The ChargePoint Court said that the use \nof these demand response  principles was [\u201c]itself an abstract \nconcept \u2014a familiar business choice to alter terms of  dealing to \n \n31  Charge Point, Inc., 920 F.3d at  764. \n \n32  Id. at 770.  \n \n33  Id. at 768.  \n \n34  (D.I. 1, ex.

Here, as noted above, the  specification does [ not]  say a \nwhole lot in regard to the two -threshold element , though as the  \nCourt will note in a moment, ther e is some  evidence in the record \nhere that helps fill in  some of the blanks.  But nowhere in the \nrecord  is there a statement that the two -threshold element has been \nutilized in this general field  in a similar fashion.    \n In ChargePoint , the Court said that the  claims failed to improve \nhow charging stations  function.\n38  Here, however, there[ is] a \nbetter  record establishing at least a fact dispute as  to whether the \ntwo-threshold method resulted in an improved technological \nmethod that overcame  prior art problems with the operation of  \naudience measurement meters.   While the  specification does [ not]  \nseem to reference the two -threshold element in great detail, the Lee  \ndeclaration and paragraphs 22 through 25 of the  complaint help to \nestablish a factual dispute  as to step two.39  In those paragraphs  [of \nthe Lee declaration] , Ms. Lee  explains how using two thresholds \nresults in an  effect known as hysteresis, which is an advantage over \nprior art methods in terms of  measuring power consumption to \ndetermine  whether a television is on.40  Ms. Lee details  how this is \nso, in that a given television will  have an average power \nconsumption, but the  actual power consumption at any given time \nwill vary a certain amount, and such variations can  be frequent and \nrapid.  She explained that, for  example, if a television has an \naverage power  consumption of 40 watts in an on state, then if  a \nsingle threshold (like 40 watts) were used to determine if the \ntelevision was on, that that  could lead to false determinations \nbecause, for  example, sometimes the power consumption rate  can \ngo slightly lower than 40 watts but the [television] can still be on. In contrast, she explains  that using a hysteresis effect can help with  \nthis problem, in that the determined state of  the television only \nchanges if the variation in  power consumption is significant \nenough to evidence a true change in the on/off state of  the device.  \nFor example, if thresholds of  40 watts and 10 watts are used, then \n \n37  Charge Point, Inc., 920 F.3d at 771. \n \n38  Id. at 774- 75. \n \n39  (D.I. 1, ex.

B at \u00b6  11)  12 \n the television will be deemed on if the pow er consumption is \nabove 40 watts and deemed off if  below  [10]  watts, and if the \npower consumption is in between those points, the state will be  \ndetermined to remain the same as the last  determined state.  \n \nChamberlain Gr [p.] Inc. v[.] Techtronic  Indus [.] Co[.]41 is \nanother case that  Defendant highlights as having similar claims  to \nclaim 7 here,42 but it is easily  distinguishable.  In Chamberlain, the \nFederal  Circuit found that the representative claim was  directed to \nthe abstract idea of \u201c wirelessly  communicating status information \nabout a  system [,]\u201d in significant part because the  specification \nhelped confirm that the only difference between the claimed \nmovable barrier  operator system and the prior art movable barrier \noperator systems was that in the claim,  the status information about \nthe system was  communicated wirelessly [\u2014]a concept that the \npatent acknowledged was conventional and well -understood.43  \nHere, in contrast, as just  explained, there is at leas t a fact dispute as  \nto whether the two- threshold element provides  an inventive \nconcept.  \n \nFinally, in WiTricity Corp. v[.] Momentum Dynamics Corp., \nanother case, th [is] one from the District of Delaware, that \n[D]efendant highlights as being similar to claim 7,44 the abstract \nidea at issue was  \u201coptimizing the efficiency or power level of a  \nwireless power transfer while maintaining at least a minimal level \nof both.\u201d45  The  representative claims at issue seem [ed] to just  \nrehash this abstract idea, without saying anything specific about \nhow to do so.  The  WiTricity  Court explained that the claims would \nthus preempt a substantial number of uses of a  fundamental \nprinciple.46  Here, though, claim 7 recites a specific way of \naccomplishing the  idea of collecting viewership data when a  \ntelevision is on.  It [ is] true [that] in WiTricity the  representative \n \n41  Chamberlain Grp. Inc. v. Techtronic Indus. Co., 935 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2019). \n \n42  (D.I. 11 at 12)  \n \n43  935 F.3d at 1346, 1348- 49. \n \n44  (D.I. 15 at 5)  \n \n45  WiTricity Corp. v. Momentum Dynamics Corp., 563 F. Supp. 3d 309, 315 (D. Del. \n2021). \n \n46  Id. at 322.  \n 13 \n claim also used the word  \u201cthreshold\u201d  just like claim 7 does .47  The  \nWiTricity  claim states that a circuit would  optimize transfer \nefficiency of power  transmitted wirelessly to the receiver or  \noptimize the amount of the power received wirelessly to the \nreceiver [] if  certain values were greater than or equal to  certain \nthresholds.  But although the patent in WiTricity  was trying to \naccomplish the goal of  optimizing the power level or efficiency of \na wireless power transfer, the two thresholds  mentioned in the \nclaim were [ not]  asserted to be the way that you did that .  Here, in \ncontrast,  the two -threshold element is asserted to be the  claimed \nsolution for solving a technological  problem at issue.  In WiTricity , \nthe Court also noted that the patent did not \u201c set[] any threshold for \ntransfer efficiency or amount of  power that would achieve the \noptimization  goal.\u201d48  While claim 7 does [ not]  set any  particular \nthresholds either, the claim does at  least require that the use of two \nthresholds be  in place, and it utilizes a greater than/less  than \nstructure .  Paragraph 11 of the Lee  declaration explains, as I have \nset out  previously, how the use of two thresholds is a [n] improved \napproach because it results in a hysteresis effect, which allows for an accurate determination of whether the television is on.\n49 \n \nFor all  [of] these reasons, the Court  finds that claim 7 here is more \nsimilar to the  claims that were at issue in Bascom Global  Internet \nServices, Inc., v [.] AT&T Mobility,  LLC .50  In that case, for \nexample, a representative claim at issue recited a system  for \nfiltering internet content that comprised, first, a local client computer that generated  network access requests for individual \nnetwork accounts; second, one or more filtering schemes; third, a plurality of sets of logical  filtering elements; and, fourth, a remote \nISP server that associated each network account to  at least one \nfiltering scheme and set of  filtering elements.\n51  While filtering \ncontent on the [I] nternet was a known concept at the time  the \npatent issued, the patent in Bascom  explained how the claimed \nparticular  arrangement of elements amounted to a technical  \n \n47  Id. at 318- 19.  \n \n48  Id. at 319.  \n \n49  (D.I. 1, ex. B at \u00b6 11)  \n \n50  Bascom Global Internet Servs., Inc. v. AT&T Mobility, LLC , 827 F.3d 1341 (Fed. \nCir. 2016). \n \n51  Id. at 1345.  \n 14 \n improvement over prior art methods of filtering content.52  The \nFederal Circuit concluded the  patentee adequately alleged that the \nclaims  passed muster at step two of Alice , with the  claims \nproviding the inventive concept of the  installation of a filtering tool \nat a specific location, remote from end users, with customizable \nfiltering features specific to  each end user.  Accordingly, the \nBascom Court  held that the claims did not preempt all ways  of \nfiltering content on the internet, and instead recited \u201ca specific, \ndiscrete implementation of the abstract idea of  filtering content \u201d \nthat amounted to a technical  improvement over prior  art methods.53  \nHere too,  the complaint \u2019s allegations and the Lee  declaration, \ntaken together with the  specification of the '994 patent and the  \ncontent of claim 7, create a material factual  dispute as to patent \neligibility [.] \n \n[A]nd so for  all these reasons the Court, therefore, denies  \nDefendant \u2019s motion. \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n  \n \n52  Id. at 1350.  \n \n53  Id.
