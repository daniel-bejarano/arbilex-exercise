{"case_name": "Twardzik v. HP Inc. et al", "case_number": "21-396", "judge": "Judge Stephanos Bibas", "date": "01-25-2022", "ocr_text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nMARK TWARDZIK, individually and  \non behalf of all others similarly sit uated \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n \nHP INC.,  NVIDIA  CORPORATION  \n \nDefendants . \n No. 1:21-cv-00396-SB \n \nPeter Bradford deLeeuw, DELEEUW LAW LLC, Wilmington, Delaware.  \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff.  \n Kelly E. Farnan, R\nICHARDS , LAYTON , & FINGER , PA, Wilmington, Delaware;  Lau-\nrence Pulgram, Molly Melcher, F ENWICK & WEST LLP,  San Francisco, California.  \n \nCounsel for Defendant s. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \nJanuary 25, 2022  \n \n \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nTo sue  in federal courts , a plaintiff must allege an injury . Otherwise, there is no \ncase or controversy for judges to resolve. Mark Twardzik does that : he bought a laptop \nthat does not work as well as he expected. So I can hear his case . \nEven so, Twardzik\u2019s suit can continue only if he states a legal claim . He does not . \nHe says the laptop\u2019s manufacturers defrauded him , yet he never alleges that they \nmisstated any fact or that he relied on their misstatements  or omissions . So I dismiss \nhis claims with prejudice.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nMark Twardzik wanted to buy  a small but pow erful laptop to play video games \n\u201cwhile travelling.\u201d First Am. Compl., D.I. 15 \u00b6  87. So he scoured the internet for  the \nperfect machine  and quickly zeroed in on HP\u2019s Envy 13.  He consulted third- party \nreview s, which  suggested that it could run video games \u201cin hi gh settings a[t] the full \nresolution.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 85\u201386 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). \nImpressed, he bought it . Id. \u00b6 88. \nBut soon he was disappointed. His laptop glitched while running  video games. Id. \n\u00b6 89. When he investigated the problem, he realized that HP had purposely slowed \ndown the graphics card in the Envy 13 . Id. \u00b6 90.  \nUnderstanding HP\u2019s decision requires a little technical background. Ma ny of its \nlaptops, including the Envy 13, contain a powerful NVIDIA MX150 graphics card.  Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 27, 65. But that card does not work as well when installed in small computers. To \ncombat the problem, HP used software to slow the card in those machines . Doing so 3 meant that the card needed  less power and put out less heat , though HP let users \nmanually increase its speed. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 52, 65. \nHP never  told buyers that it had slowed the cards down . Buyers could find out  \nwhich card they got only by  examining a computer itself. Id.  \u00b6 82. Even so, HP \nstressed that its slower laptops provided \u201camazing gaming performance\u201d and \u201cfantas-\ntic [high -resolu tion] entertainment.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 67. NVID IA piled on, touting the MX150 as \noffering excellent gaming performance. Id.  \u00b6 68\u201369. \nGiven a ll of that , Twardzik felt misled. So he brought this  class -action lawsuit \nagainst HP and NVIDIA, alleging consumer -protection violations , fraudulent con-\ncealment, and unjust enrichment. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 128\u201359. He seeks mone tary damages  from \nboth defendants , plus equitable relief against HP. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 123\u2013 27, 142, 152, 159. He \nbrought these claims under the law of his home state, Maryland, but anticipated that other class members might have claims under their own states \u2019 laws. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 109 \u2013\n23. \nAfter letting  Twardzik amend his complaint once, HP and NVIDIA now  move to \ndismiss it. D.I. 13, 16. They say Twardzik lacks  standing to seek damages and equi-\ntable relief. D.I. 17, at 7 \u201311. Plus, they argue, he lacks  standing to bring claims on \nbehalf of other class members under other states\u2019 laws. Id.  at 20. E ven if he does, they \nsay he has not stated a claim. Id.  at 11 \u201320. \nAs I will explain, Twardzik does have standing to bring claims for damages, \nthough not for equitable relief. E ven so, he fails to state a claim.  4 II. TWARDZIK HAS STANDING TO SEEK DAMAGES ,  \nNOT EQUITABLE RELIEF  \nStart with standing. That doctrine requires plaintiffs to show a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \nin any case they bring to federal court. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2203 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). HP and NVIDIA say Tw ardzik lacks  \na personal stake in this case sufficient for  damages, an injunction, or rescission. Cf. \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst. , 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (requiring courts to examine \nstanding for \u201ceach type of relief sought\u201d). Plus, they see  a standing problem  with a \nclass action suit brought under the laws of nearly three dozen states. See D.I. 1 -1. I \nconsider each argument in turn. See In re Johnson & Johnson Talcum Powder Prods. \nMarketing, Sales Practices & Liability Litig ., 903 F.3d 278, 284 \u201385 (3d Cir. 2018).  \nA. Damages  \nTo establish \u201cstanding to seek monetary damages,\u201d Twardzik must point to (1) \u201can \ninjury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable  to the challenged conduct of the defendant, \nand (3) is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d In re Johnson & \nJohnson, 903 F.3d at 284 (internal quotation marks omitted). He meets his burden \nby pleading enough \u201cfacts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that [he] has \nstanding to sue.\u201d Finkelman v. NFL, 810 F.3d 187, 194 (3d Cir. 2016)  (quoting Amidax \nTrading Grp. v. S.W.I.F.T. SCRL, 671 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2011) ). \nThe parties dispute whether Twardzik has an  \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d An injury in fact is \n\u201can invasion of a legally protected interest\u201d that is \u201cconcrete,\u201d \u201cparticularized,\u201d and \n\u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d In re Johnson & Johnson, 903 \nF.3d at 284 (internal quotation marks omitted).  5 Twardzik wins this b attle.  He claims that he \u201cpaid for diagnoses, repairs, and re-\nplacements,\u201d along with \u201csoftware and hardware\u201d that did not work on the laptop. \nFirst Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  119, 127, 141, 151.  Plus, he has plausibly pled that his laptop \ndid not do what he \u201cexpected it to do\u201d: run video games and display high -resolution \nimages. In re Johnson & Johnson, 903 F.3d at 283 (\u201c[A] plaintiff might successfully \nplead an economic injury by alleging that she bargained for a product worth a given \nvalue but received a product worth less than that value .\u201d); see First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  91, \n120, 127, 141, 149, 151. So I can presume that Twardzi k got less than he bargained \nfor. In re Johnson & Johnson, 903 F.3d at 285.  \nHP and NVIDIA push back . But the cases that they rely on are inapt.  In one, a \nwoman sought  damages because she bought baby powder that she later discovered \nwas linked to an increased risk of cancer. Id.  at 282. Yet she did not dispute that the \nbaby powder \u201csuccessfully did what the parties had bargained for and expected it to: eliminate d friction on the skin, absorb ed excess moisture, and maintain ed freshness.\u201d \nId. at 283. So  she had not shown an injury.  \nIn another, a man claimed that the NFL improperly allocated Super Bowl tickets \nto insiders. Finkelman , 810 F.3d at 200. But he failed to  show  that this practice drove  \nup ticket prices. Id.  His claimed injury , that he overp aid, was thus \u201cnothing more \nthan supposition.\u201d Id.  at 201.  \nBut here, Twardzik has  plausibly  alleged that the laptop was \u201cworth less than \nwhat [he] paid for.\u201d In re Johnson & Johnson, 903 F.3d at 287. So he has shown an \ninjury in fact and has standing to seek d amages.  6 B. Injunctive Relief  \nInjunctive relief is a different matter. \u201cIn order to have standing to seek injunctive \nrelief, [Twardzik] must establish that [he] is likely  to suffer future injury from the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d Id. at 292 (internal quotation marks omitted)  (emphasis added). \nHe does not.  \nTwardzik says that  HP will continue \u201cmarketing, advertising, selling, and leasing\u201d \nlaptops. First Am. Compl. \u00b6  126. If so, he might buy another one someday.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 126\u2013\n27; D.I. 21 , at 10. \nBut this supposed injury is \u201c hypothetical .\u201d In re Subaru Battery Drain Prods. Liab. \nLitig. , 2021 WL 1207791, at *31 (D.N.J. Mar. 31, 2021) ( quoting Hesse v. Godiva \nChocolatier, Inc. , 463 F. Supp. 3d 453, 465 (S.D.N.Y. 2020)) (emphasis in original). \nAfter al l, no one will force Twardzik to buy another HP product. I cannot consider \n\u201cthis sort of \u2018stop m e before I buy again\u2019 claim.\u201d In re Johnson & Johnson, 903 F.3d \nat 293.  \nC. Rescission  \nTwardzik also seeks a \u201crescission\u201d order forcing HP to \u201crepurchas[e] the [] [laptops] \nfor their full cost.\u201d First Am. Compl. \u00b6  126. HP says that Twardzik\u2019s injury is not \n\u201credressab[le]\u201d by a rescission order, so he lacks  standing to seek it. Friends of the \nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envi ro. Servs. (TOC), Inc. , 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000);  see D.I. \n17, at 9 \u201310. \nHP is right. Rescission is a contract remedy letting  one party to the contract  \u201cun-\nmak[e]\u201d it for some \u201clegally sufficient reason ,\u201d such as \u201cthe other party\u2019s material \nbreach\u201d or \u201cfraud.\u201d  Lawley v. Northam , 2011 WL 1327652, at *11 \u201312 (D. Md. Apr. 5, 7 2011).  It is available  only against anyone who \u201cparticipated\u201d or \u201cha[s] interests\u201d in \nthe purchase.\u201d  Id. at 12. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nYet Twardzik seeks rescission against a company that  did not sell him the laptop . \nTrue, HP manufactured  the laptop. But he bought  it from a \u201cthird -party retailer.\u201d Id.  \n\u00b6\u00b6 84\u201386, 88. Because HP did not sell h im the laptop, I cannot order it to buy it  back. \nSo Twardzik cannot get recission .  \nD. Class Standing  \nTwardzik sues on behalf of others under the deceptive- practices statutes of thirty -\nthree different states. Id.  \u00b6 111; D.I. 1 -1. HP and NVIDIA say he lac ks standing to do \nso. D.I. 17, at 20. Twardzik counters that any problem with these claims goes to the \nclass\u2019s validity under Rule  23, not standing. D.I. 21, at 20.  \nTwardzik is right: this is not a standing problem. As I have discussed, standing \ndoctrine requires only that plaintiffs show that \u201cthey have been injured, [that] the \ndefendants caused that injury, and [that] the injury can be redressed by a judicial \ndecisi on.\u201d Morrison v. YTB Int\u2019l, Inc. , 649 F.3d 533, 536 (7th Cir. 2011). Twardizk has \nshown that. And because he has standing, the proposed class does too. Neale v. Volvo \nCars of N. Am., LLC , 794 F.3d 353, 364 (3d Cir. 2015).  \nThe fact that he raises other stat es\u2019 laws does not change this analysis. Concerns \nabout applying the \u201claws of all 50 states\u201d in one action \u201cmay affect whether [the] class \nshould be certified.\u201d Morrison , 649 F.3d at 536. That is so because class actions may \nproceed only if \u201cthere are quest ions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Fed R. Civ. \nP. 23(b). If several states\u2019 laws apply and those laws differ, a class action may not be \nproper. See, e.g. , Grandalski v. Quest Diagnostics Inc. , 767 F.3d 175, 183 \u201384 (3d Cir. 8 2014). Yet that finding wo uld not undermine an individual plaintiff\u2019s standing.  Lan-\ngan v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Cos., Inc. , 897 F.3d 88, 96 (2d Cir. 2018); Mor-\nrison , 649 F.3d at 536; In re Asacol Antitrust Litig ., 907 F.3d 42, 50 \u201351 (1st Cir. 2018); \nMayor of Baltimore v. Act elion Pharma. Ltd ., 995 F.3d 123, 134 (4th Cir. 2021). Be-\ncause Twardzik has standing, I will not consider the putative class\u2019s other state law \nclaims until the certification stage. See First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  109\u201323. \nTo summarize: Twardzik cannot seek an injunction or rescission, but he does have \nstanding to seek damages. And because he  has standing, I need not consider the chal-\nlenges inherent in a multi -state class yet. \nIII. TWARDZIK DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY PLEAD FRAUD  \nOn to the merits. Twardzik brings three claims: (1) violations of consumer protec-\ntion laws, (2) fraud and fraudulent concealment, and (3) unjust enrichment. First Am. \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6  109\u201323, 128 \u201359. All three claims are based on fraudulent activity. See id.  \n\u00b6\u00b6 135, 145\u2013 51, 157. So all three are subject to the hei ghtened pleading requirements \nof Rule 9(b). See Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw, LLP , 1:21 -cv-00249, at 5\u2013 6 (D. Del. Nov. \n22, 2021) . That Rule requires plaintiffs \u201calleging fraud\u201d to \u201cstate [their claims] with \nparticularity.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  \nTwardzik advances  two theories of fraud. First, he says HP and NVIDIA \u201cmade \nfalse representations concerning the performance and quality of the [laptops].\u201d First Am. Compl. \u00b6  145; accord  id. \u00b6\u00b6 138, 142, 146, 150, 155 \u201356. Alternatively, he says the \ncompanies \u201cactively concealed and suppressed material facts.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 145; accord id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 134\u201336, 137, 146\u201349, 155 \u201356. Both theories fail.  9 A. Misrepresentation  \nPlaintiffs alleging misrepresentation must provide \u201cthe \u2018who , what, when, where, \nand how\u2019 of the events at issue.\u201d In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 311 F.3d \n198, 217 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. , 114 F.3d \n1410, 1422 (3d Cir. 1997)).  \nFor Twardzik, that means expla ining exactly how HP and NVIDIA \u201cmade a false \nrepresentation\u201d that he reasonably \u201crelied on.\u201d See Premier Cap., LLC v. Citizens \nBank of Pa. , 2018 WL 3414217, at *4 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. July 13, 2018)  (fraud); Dani-\nyan v. Viridian Energy LLC , 2015 WL 4031752,  at *2 (D. Md. June 30, 2015) (Mary-\nland-Consumer -Protection -Act claim sounding in fraud ); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo. v. Carefree Land Chiropractic, LLC , 2018 WL 6514797, at *4 (D. Md. Dec. 11, \n2018) (unjust -enrichment claims premised on fraud must sati sfy Rule 9(b)). But he \nshows neither falsity nor reliance.  \nFalsity.  To be false , \u201ca statement must [ ] misrepresent [] [a] material fact. It can-\nnot be an estimate or opinion or puffing.\u201d Daniyan , 2015 WL 4031752, at *2 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Tw ardzik says several statements about the MX150 and \nEnvy 13 are misrepresentations.  \nNVIDIA said that the MX150:  \n\u2022 offers \u201cup to 3x superior performance -per-Watt,\u201d First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, \n68; \n\u2022 \u201csupercharges  your laptop for work and play,\u201d id.  \u00b6\u00b6 12, 69;  10 \u2022 provides \u201cup to 4x faster performance over integrated graphics for photo \nand video -editing applications, as well as faster, smoother gaming,\u201d id. ; and  \n\u2022 would allow users \u201cto play at full HD resolution at a sm ooth 60 frames per \nsecond,\u201d id. \u00b6 70. \nHP said that the Envy 13:  \n\u2022 was \u201cexceptionally powerful , with [i]ncredible speed,\u201d id.  \u00b6\u00b6 14, 67  (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (alteration in original) ; \n\u2022 allowed \u201cunbridled performance that overpowers even the most demanding \ntasks,\u201d id.;  \n\u2022 had \u201cthe power and responsiveness to help your productivity soar,\u201d id. ; and  \n\u2022 enabled users to \u201c[e]xperience amazing gaming performance, seamlessly edit and share 360 video, and enjoy fantastic 4K Ultra HD entertainment,\u201d \nid. (altera tion in original).  \nBut Twardzik never says these statements are false.  Boasts that the MX150 \u201csu-\npercharges your laptop\u201d or that the Envy 13 \u201coverpowers even the most demanding \ntasks\u201d are \u201cexaggeration[s] or overstatement[s],\u201d mere puffery, not \u201cactionable\u201d  \nclaims. Castrol Inc. v. Pennzoil Co. , 987 F.2d 939, 945 (3d Cir. 1993).  \nStatements  that the MX150 would provide \u201cup to\u201d three - or four -times faster per-\nformance  are not clearly false. Twardzik never denies that the laptop  can run at those \nspeeds, if only under certain conditions. See First Am. Compl.  \u00b6\u00b6 22, 51\u2013 53. And \u201ca \nreasonable consumer\u201d would expect as much: \u201cthe phrase \u2018up to\u2019 \u201d implies that  that 11 \u201cspeeds could be less than advertised ,\u201d at times.  Fink v. Time Warner C able, 714 F.3d \n739, 742 n.3 (2d Cir. 2013)  (internal quotation marks omitted) .  \nAnd though Twardzik points to NVIDIA\u2019s  promise that the MX150 would let  users \n\u201cplay a full HD resolution at a smooth 60 frames per second ,\u201d he never pleads facts \nshowing that it is false.  First Am. Compl. \u00b6  70; see D.I. 17, at 15 n.2. True, he notes \nthat his laptop did not run smoothly. First Am. Compl. \u00b6  89. But he never discusses \nhow many \u201cframes per second\u201d the laptop processed\u2014and I cannot infer that infor-\nmation from his com plaint . So he has not pointed to a false representation.  \nReliance. Twardzik\u2019s claims fail for another reason  too: he does not explain how \nhe relied on statements by HP and NVIDIA. True, he says he \u201creli[ed] on [their] mis-leading marketing.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 88. But he provides no information to support this \u2014even \nafter HP and NVIDIA flagged this deficiency in an earlier motion to dismiss . D.I. 7, \nat 15 \u201316. He never  even  says he saw th eir marketing before he bought  his laptop. \nIndeed, he mentions only reviewing third -party promotions and reviews before buy-\ning. First Am. Compl.  \u00b6\u00b6 84\u201386; D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  81\u201383 (same). That is not nearly enough to \nsatisfy Rule 9(b).  \nIn fact, the one third -party source  he links to undercuts his claim . Cf. Pension \nBenefit Guar. Corp. v. Whi te Consol. Indus., Inc. , 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)  \n(allowing review of exhibits attached to a complaint ). He says his research indicated \n\u201cthat the MX150 was \u2026 comparable to\u201d other \u201cmainstream\u201d graphics processing units \n\u201cthat could play games\u201d at \u201cfull HD resolution.\u201d First Am. Compl. \u00b6  86 (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted) . But the only third -party review he suggests reading admits 12 that \u201c[t]he performance of [the comparable graphics processing unit] can vary quite \na lot depending on the cooling performance of the laptop\u2026. [T]he notebook model is \nusually a bit slower.\u201d See Klaus Hinium, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Mobile , Note-\nbookcheck (Jan. 12, 2017), https://perma.cc/L2HG -V34P ; see also First Am. Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 86, 88.  If that is how he thought  the MX150 would work , he cannot claim reliance \non any deception.  \nB. Omission  \nTwardzik says that, even if he has not sufficiently pled misrepresentation, he has \npled omission. D.I. 21, at 11. He points to the \u201crelaxed\u201d standard applied in cases \ninvolving \u201comissions of material fact,\u201d not affirmative misrepresentations. Id. (quot-\ning Doll v. Ford Motor Co. , 814 F. Supp. 2d 526, 538 (D. Md. 2011)).  \nHe is right that the standard for omissions is \u201clower.\u201d Doll, 814 F. Supp. 2d at 538. \n\u201c[O]missions cannot be described in terms of the time, place, and contents of the mis-representation.\u201d Id. So those details are unnecessary.  \nBut the substantive elements of the claim do not change. Compare Won Kim , 2018 \nWL 1791916, at *3 (fraud elements), with Crystal v. Midatlantic Cardiovascular As-\nsociates, P.A. , 133 A.3d 1198, 1209 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2016) (fraudulent concealment \nelements). Either way, p laintiffs must show reliance. Id.  Because Twardzik has not \ndone that, his omission theory fails too.  \n* * * * * \nTwardzik fails to show that he relied on anything HP or NVIDIA did or did not \nsay. So I dismiss his claims. And because he has amended his complaint once already, \nI will not let him amend again.
