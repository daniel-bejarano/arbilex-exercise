WILLIAMS \nU.S. DISTRICT JUDGE \nPending before this Court is Defendants Gogo Business Aviation, LLC, and Gogo Inc.'s \n(\"Gogo\") Motion to Strike sections from Plaintiff SmartSky Networks , LLC's (\"SmartSky \") reply \nbrief in support of SmartSky's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and from the accompanying \nsupplemental declaration of Dr. Steven Goldberg , SmartSky 's technical expert (D.I. 97), and \nSmartSky's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (D.I. 6). For the reasons set forth below, the Court \nwill deny Gogo's Motion to Strike and SmartSky 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn February 28, 2022, SmartSky brought this lawsuit against Gogo alleging infringement \nof United States Patent Nos. 9,312,947 (the '\"947 patent\"), 11,223,417 (the \"'417 patent\"), \n10,257,717 (the \"'717 patent\"), and 9,730,077 (the \"'077 patent\"). D.I. 1. On the same day, \nSmartSky moved for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Gogo from making, using, offering \nto sell, or selling its 5G Network. D.I. 6. The parties stipulated to a limited discovery schedule, \npermitting the parties to serve limited document requests and interrogatories and take the \ndepositions of each parties' declarants . D.I. 40. The stipulation was entered by this Court on \nMarch 23, 2022. D.I. 41. Gogo filed its answering brief in opposition to SmartSky 's Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction on May 5, 2022 (D.I. 76), and SmartSky filed its reply brief on June 3, \n2022 (D.I. 93). On June 17, 2022, Gogo filed a Motion to Strike Sections II.A. I and II.A.2 from \nSmartSky's reply brief and ,r,r 20-45, 47-57, 65-66, and 70-119 from Dr. Goldberg 's rebuttal \ndeclaration filed with SmartSky 's reply brief. D.I. 97. SmartSky filed its answering brief in \nopposition to Gogo' s Motion to Strike on July 1, 2022 (D .I. 106), and Gogo filed its reply brief on \nJuly 15, 2022 (D.I. 110). \n1 II. LEGAL STANDARD \nDelaware Local Rule 7 .1.3( c )(2) provides, in relevant part, that \"[t ]he party filing the \nopening brief shall not reserve material for the reply brief which should have been included in a \nfull and fair opening brief.\" D. Del. LR 7.l.3(c)(2). \"This provision exists, in part, to prevent \nlitigants from engaging in impermissible 'sandbagging ,' reserving crucial arguments for a reply \nbrief to which an opponent cannot respond.\" Fifth Mkt., Inc. v. CME Grp., Inc., C.A. No. 08-520-\nGMS, 2013 WL 3063461, at *1 n.2 (D. Del. June 19, 2013) (citing Rockwell Techs., LLC v. \nSpectra-Physics Lasers, Inc., C.A. No. 00-589-GMS , 2002 WL 531555, at *3 (D. Del. Mar. 26, \n2002)). Arguments and evidence submitted in violation of this rule may be excluded. See Bos. \nSci. Scimed, Inc. v. Cordis Corp., 434 F. Supp. 2d 308,314 (D. Del. June 15, 2006), rev'dinpart \non other grounds, 554 F.3d 982 (Fed. Cir. 2009). But, a party does not violate this provision when \nthe new material in its reply brief responds to arguments raised in the answering brief. Id.; see \nalso Cornell Univ. v. fllumina, Inc., C.A. No. 10-433-LPS-MPT, 2018 WL 11427960, at *4 n.48 \n(D. Del. Feb. 23, 2018) (\"[E]verything in plaintiffs' reply memorandum is either in the original \nbrief or in response to defendants' arguments ... Therefore , defendants ' motion is denied.\") ( citing \nIn re Fleming Co., Inc., 316 B.R. 809, 815 n.3 (D. Del. 2004)). \nPreliminary injunctive relief is an \"extraordinary \" remedy appropriate only in \"limited \ncircumstances.\" Kos Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 708 (3d Cir. 2004) (citation \nomitted); see also Intel Corp. v. ULSI Sys. Tech., Inc., 995 F.2d 1566, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (\"[A] \npreliminary injunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy that is not to be routinely granted.\") \n(citations omitted); accord Cordis Corp. v. Medtronic , Inc., 780 F.2d 991, 996 (Fed. Cir. 1985) \n(\"Only a viable threat of serious harm which cannot be undone authorizes exercise of a court's \nequitable power to enjoin before the merits are fully determined. \") (internal quotation marks and \n2 citations omitted). However , the Patent Act expressly provides that courts \"may grant injunctions \nin accordance with the principles of equity to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent, \non such terms as the court deems reasonable. \" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 283. \nA movant for a preliminary injunction pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 283 must establish: \"(1) a \nreasonable likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted; \n(3) a balance of hardships tipping in its favor; and (4) the injunction 's favorable impact on the \npublic interest.\" Amazon.com , Inc. v. Barnesandnoble .com, Inc., 239 F.3d 1343, 1350 (Fed. Cir. \n2001) (citation omitted). No one of these factors is dispositive; \"rather, the district court must \nweigh and measure each factor against the other factors and against the form and magnitude of the \nrelief requested. \" Id. (quoting Hybritech, Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 849 F.2d 1446, 1451 (Fed. Cir. \n1988)). However , \"a movant cannot be granted a preliminary injunction unless it establishes both \nof the first two factors, i.e., likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm.\" Id. \n(emphasis in original) (citations omitted). Moreover, \"[w]hile granting a preliminary injunction \nrequires analysis of all four factors, [] a trial court may ... deny a motion based on a patentee's \nfailure to show any one of the four factors-especially either of the first two-without analyzing \nthe others[.]\" Jack Guttman, Inc. v. KopyKak e Enters., Inc., 302 F.3d 1352, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2002) \n( citations omitted); see also Chrysler Motors Corp. v. Auto Body Panels of Ohio, Inc., 908 F .2d \n951,953 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (\"If the injunction is denied, the absence of an adequate showing with \nregard to any one factor may be sufficient, given the weight or lack of it assigned the other factors, \nto justify the denial.\"). \n3 III. DISCUSSION \nSmartSky 's reply brief in support of its Motion for Preliminary Injunction and the \naccompanying rebuttal declaration by Dr. Goldberg are responsive to Gogo's arguments raised in \nits answering brief. Thus, the Court will deny Gogo's Motion to Strike portions of SmartSky 's \nreply brief in support of SmartSky 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and from the \naccompanying rebuttal declaration of Dr. Goldberg . With respect to SmartSky 's Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction , SmartSky failed to carry its burden of demonstrating a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits and that it will be irreparabl y harmed if an injunction is not granted. Thus, \nthe Court will deny SmartSky 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nA. Motion to Strike \nGogo contends SmartSky 's reply brief in support of its preliminary injunction \"abandons \nSmartSky's original interpretations of its claims, and advances new infringement theories under \nnew, and much broader, interpretations of its claims, none of which were mentioned in SmartSky ' s \nmotion.\" D.I. 98 at 1. Gogo asserts two argument s. First, Gogo alleges portions of SmartSky 's \nreply brief and Dr. Goldberg 's rebuttal declaration present a new interpretation of the \"continuous \nand uninterrupted \" limitation in the '947 patent and the '417 patent. Id at 8-13. Second, Gogo \nalleges portions of SmartSky 's and Dr. Goldberg 's rebuttal declaration present an improper new \ntheory of infringement for the '717 patent regarding the number of radios required by the claims \nand handovers between base stations. Id at 13-16. \nThe infringement arguments contained in SmartSky 's reply brief in support of its \npreliminary injunction and Dr. Goldberg 's rebuttal declaration are consistent with SmartSky 's \nopening brief and respond to arguments raised in Gogo's answering brief. In SmartSky 's opening \nbrief, it asserted that Gogo's 5G Network infringes claims 1 and 11 of the '947 patent because \n4 D.I. 24 at 8. [t]he different communication links provided by Gogo's 5G network \nare high speed links that are \"maintained continuous and \nuninterrupted\" while the aircraft transitions between steerable \nbeams of different base stations having overlapping coverage areas. \nFor example, Gogo's 5G system conducts \"make before break\" \nhandoffs, which allow for uninterrupted connectivity to passengers. \nIn support of SmartSky 's opening brief, Dr. Goldberg stated: \nGogo' s \"make before break\" handoffs are one example of a \ncommunication link that is \"maintained continuous and \nuninterrupted in time.\" Additionally, Gogo marketing literature \nstates that the system provides \"uninterrupted connectivity \" to \npassengers. \nD.I. 26 at ,r 102. \nGogo responded in its answering brief that \"Gogo's 5G Network will use a 'break-then-\nmake' handover\" and \"[s]uch handovers are discontinuous and contain an interruption in time.\" \nD.I. 76 at 6. Gogo concludes that, because its 5G Network uses a \"break-then-make\" handover , it \ndoes not infringe SmartSky 's asserted patents. Id. In response, SmartSky states that, even if \nGogo's 5G Network uses a \"break-then-make \" handover, \"Gogo's technical documents confirm \nthat 5G network handovers are conducted to maintain the continuity of the connection between the \nbase stations and the aircraft.\" D.I. 93 at 1. SmartSky also filed a rebuttal report by Dr. Goldberg \nproviding details about how a \"break-then-make\" handover meets the claim requirement \n\"continuous and uninterrupted in time.\" See D.I. 94. \nIn support of its Motion to Strike, Gogo contends that SmartSky is asserting a new \ninfringement theory and deviating from SmartSky 's original argument that \"continuous and \nuninterrupted in time\" requires a \"make before break\" handoff. D.I. 98 at 8. SmartSky and Dr. \nGoldberg never argued that the \"continuous and uninterrupted in time\" claim limitation requires a \n\"make before break\" handoff. Dr. Goldberg stated that \"make before break\" handoffs \"are one \n5 example of a communication link that is 'maintained continuous and uninterrupted in time,\"' and \nSmartSky noted that Gogo's 5G Network meets the claim elements of 1 and 11 of the '917 patent, \n''for example,\" by conducting make before break handoffs. See D.I. 24 at 8; D.I. 26 at ,r 102 \n(emphases added). SmartSky's reply brief and Dr. Goldberg 's rebuttal declaration are responsive \nto Gogo's argument that Gogo's 5G Network does not infringe SmartSky 's patents because Gogo's \n5G Network uses a \"break then make\" handover. \nWith respect to the '717 patent, SmartSky argued in its opening brief in support of its \npreliminary injunction that Gogo's 5G Network meets claims 1 and 12 of the '717 patent because \nGogo's 5G Network has \"a base station that employs unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band, \nand another base station that employs licensed spectrum in the 850 MHz band.\" D.I. 24 at 9. Dr. \nGoldberg submitted a declaration stating the same. See D.I. 26. In response, Gogo refutes \nSmartSky's infringement argument by asserting that the claim language in the '717 patent only \nrequires the use of a single radio and contending the aircraft equipment used for Gogo's 5G \nNetwork \"will consist of two radios, one communicating on unlicensed spectrum and other \ncommunicating on licensed spectrum.\" D.I. 76 at 8. Gogo also states that there are \"no handovers \nin the Gogo 5G Network between a first base station employing unlicensed spectrum and a second \nbase station employing licensed spectrum, or vice versa[.]\" D.I. 76 at 8. Again, SmartSky's reply \nbrief merely responds to Gogo's non-infringement arguments . Specifically, in SmartSky's reply \nbrief, it refutes Gogo's argument that the claims in the '717 patent require a single radio and \nGogo's handover argument. D.I. 93 at 3-4. \nThus, because SmartSky and Dr. Goldberg 's rebuttal declaration is responsive to Gogo's \narguments made in its answering brief, SmartSky 's reply brief does not violate Local Rule \n7.l.3(c)(2). Accordingly, Gogo's Motion to Strike is denied. \n6 B. Preliminary Injunction \ni. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nWhen seeking a preliminary injunction in an infringement suit, the patentee \"must show \nthat it will likely prove infringement , and that it will likely withstand challenges , if any, to the \nvalidity of the patent.\" Titan Tire Corp. v. Case New Holland, Inc., 566 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. \nCir. 2009). With respect to infringement , the court adheres to the same two-step analysis used at \nother stages of the case. See Waters Corp. v. Agilent Techs, Inc., 410 F. Supp. 3d 702, 708 (D. \nDel. 2019). First, the court determines the asserted claim scope. Amazon. com, Inc., 23 9 F .3d at \n13 51. Second, \"the properly construed claim is compared with the accused device to determine \nwhether all of the claim limitations are present either literally or by a substantial equivalent. \" Id \nWhen examining invalidity, the court will compare the asserted claims, as construed , to the prior \nart. Waters Corp., 410 F. Supp. 3d at 708. \nA defendant may succeed in defeating a patentee's motion for a preliminary injunction if \nit raises a \"substantial question\" as to infringement or invalidity of the patent-in-suit. Amazon. com, \nInc., 239 F.3d at 1350. A \"substantial question\" means that the defendant \"asserts an infringement \nor invalidity defense that the patentee cannot prove 'lacks substantial merit.\"' Id at 1350-51 \n(quoting Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk AIS, 108 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). \nSmartSky argues that Gogo's 5G Network literally infringes claims 1 and 11 of the '947 \npatent and the '417 patent, as well as literally infringing claims 1 and 12 of the '717 patent and \nclaims 1 and 2 of the '077 patent. D.I. 24 at 7-10. However , rather than offering a substantive \nanalysis of Gogo's accused 5G Network on a claim-by-claim basis, SmartSky's motion is littered \nwith conclusory assertions and numerous citations to hundreds of pages of expert declarations . \n7 In response, Gogo asserts three noninfringement arguments. D.I. 76 at 5-8. First, Gogo's \n5G Network does not infringe claims 1 and 11 of the '947 patent and '417 patent because it does \nnot maintain \"continuous and uninterrupted in time\" communication links between the aircraft and \nthe air-to-ground (\"ATG\") base stations. Id. at 5-7. Second, and closely related to the first \nargument , Gogo's 5G Network cannot infringe claims 1 and 12 of the '717 patent because it \nutilizes two aircraft radios communicating with the A TG base stations that employ both licensed \nand unlicensed spectrum. Id. at 7-8 (emphasis added). Third, Gogo's 5G Network does not \ninfringe claims 1 and 2 of the '077 patent because it lacks the \"plurality of terrestrial base stations\" \nlimitation. Id. at 8. In addition to its noninfringement positions, Gogo argues that the '717 patent \nand the '077 patent are invalid for indefiniteness pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, while the '077 patent \nis further invalid as obvious in view of Gogo' s own prior art. \n1. The '947 and the '417 Patents \nThe parties' respective briefing offers little argument as to the scope of the asserted claims \nof the '94 7 patent and the '417 patent. Nevertheless , the crux of the dispute on infringement is \nwhether claims 1 and 11 of the '94 7 patent and the '41 7 patent encompass communication link \nhandovers between an aircraft's radio and ATG base stations that are continuous and uninterrupted \nin time. SmartSky argues that Gogo's 5G Network infringes claim 1 and 11 because it uses \"high \nspeed links that are 'maintained continuous and uninterrupted ' while the aircraft transitions \nbetween steerable beams of different base stations having overlapping coverages .\" D.I. 24 at 8. \nIn response, Gogo argues that claims 1 and 11 require the aircraft's radio to make a communication \nlink with a subsequent A TG base station before breaking the link with the current A TG base \nstation-a \"break-then-make \" handoff--to meet the continuous and uninterrupted in time \nlimitation. D.I. 76 at 5-6. SmartSky responds that short physical layer breaks with the aircraft's \n8 radio and ATG base stations are continuous and uninterrupted in time because the higher layer \ncommunications links between the aircraft and the user is maintained. D.I. 93 at 1-3. \nOn this record, there is no reason to depart from the plain and ordinary meaning of the \nclaim language. See Aventis Pharm. Inc. v. Amino Chem. Ltd., 715 F.3d 1363, 1373 (Fed. Cir. \n2013) (\"There is a heavy presumption that claim terms are to be given their ordinary and customary \nmeaning.\"). Claim 1 recites, in relevant part: \nwherein the respective different communication links are high speed \ndata communications links that are enabled to be maintained \ncontinuous and uninterrupted in time while one of the respective \ndifferent in-flight communication nodes transitions between a first \nsteerable beam associated with a first coverage area defined by the \nnetwork base station and a second steerable beam associated with \na second coverage area defined by another network base station. \n'94 7 patent at claim 1 ; '41 7 patent at claim 1. \nClaim 11 recites, in relevant part: \nwherein the respective different communication links are high speed \ndata communications links that are enabled to be maintained \ncontinuous and uninterrupted in time while one of the respective \ndifferent in-flight communication nodes transitions between \ncorresponding steerable beams associate with respective ones of \nthe coverage areas defined by the at least two base stations. \n'94 7 patent at claim 11 ; '41 7 patent at claim 11. \nA \"high speed data communications links\" that is maintained \"continuous and \nuninterrupted in time\" is one that is continuously maintained between the aircraft and the \nground-the ATG base stations. See, e.g., '947 patent at 4:67-5:2 (\"The system may be \naccessed directly by an individual aboard an aircraft via a direct communication link that \nis continuous and uninterrupted in time with the ground.\"). This preliminary construction \nis consistent with the portions of the prosecution history cited by SmartSky. Specifically , \nduring the prosecution of the '947 patent, SrnartSky distinguished prior art that \n9 contemplated termination of the communication link between the ground-the ATG base \nstation-and the aircraft. See D.I. 94 at ,r 35; see also D.I. 77 at ,r,r 57-80. Thus, \nconsidering the record before the Court, the \"continuous and uninterrupted in time\" \nlimitation is encompassed by a continuous communication link between the aircraft and \nthe ATG base station-a \"make-before-break \" handover-rather than a \"continuous and \nuninterrupted in time\" connectivity link between the aircraft and the user. \nNext, the parties offer differing analyses of how Gogo's 5G Network works. \nSmartSky 's experts assert that Gogo's 5G Network employs a \"make-before-break \" \nhandover between the aircraft and the first and second base stations, allowing for \n\"continuous and uninterrupted \" connectivity between the aircraft and the base stations. \nD.I. 24 at 8; D.I. 26 at ,r,r 102-103. Gogo argues that these conclusions rely on \nmisinterpretations of non-technical panel discussions and third-party misstatements rather \nthan Gogo's technical documents. D.I. 76 at 6-7. Instead, Gogo's own experts aver that \nits 5G Network implements \"break-before-make \" handovers that require a physical \ndisconnection between the aircraft and the first base station prior to connecting to the \nsecond base station. Id.; see also D.I. 79 at ,r,r 12-24; D.I. 77 at ,r,r 143-156. Although \nGogo contends that this short disconnection is imperceivable to a network user and \nmaintains the appearance of continuity , the short disconnection means that handovers are \nnot \"continuous and uninterrupted in time.\" Id. In reply, SmarkSky 's expert concedes that \nGogo's 5G Networks utilizes \"break-before-make \" handoffs between the aircraft and the \nbase station (D.I. 94 at ,r 73) but argues that Gogo still meets the \"continuous and \nuninterrupted in time\" limitation because the connection between the user and the aircraft \nis continuous and uninterrupted. D.I. 93 at 1-3; D.I. 94 at ,r,r 51-56. \n10 In light of SmartSky 's cursory showing on infringement, SmartSky has failed to \ncarry its burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits as to infringement \nof the '947 patent and the '417 patent. Gogo has raised substantial questions as to whether \nits accused 5G Network meets the \"continuous and uninterrupted in time\" limitation \nbetween the A TG base stations and the aircraft even though there is a short disconnection \nbetween the aircraft and the base station. \n2. The '717 Patent \nThe parties once again offer little argument as to the scope of the asserted claims. However , \nthe dispute centers around whether claims 1 and 12 of the '717 patent encompass multiple radios \non the aircraft, and whether the claims encompass handovers between a first base station \nemploying only unlicensed spectrum and a second base station employing only licensed spectrum. \nSmartSky argues that the claims contemplate multiple radios on the aircraft (DJ. 24 at 9; see also \nD.I. 93 at 3), while Gogo asserts that a plain reading of the claim language requires a single radio \n(D.I. 76 at 7). Further, SmartSky argues that claims 1 and 12 do not require one base station solely \nemploying the unlicensed spectrum and a second base station solely employing the licensed \nspectrum (D.I. 93 at 3-4), while Gogo asserts that a plain reading of the claims demonstrates that \nthe first base station only employs unlicensed spectrum and the second base station only employs \nlicensed spectrum. D.I. 76 at 7-8. Claim 1 recites, in relevant part: \na first base station including a first antenna array defining a first \ndirectional radiation pattern that is oriented toward a horizon; and \na second base station including second antenna array defining a \nsecond directional radiation pattern that at least partially overlaps \nwith the first base station, \nwherein the first base station employs unlicensed spectrum , \nwherein the second base station employs licensed spectrum, \nwherein the first and second base stations are each configured to \nwirelessly communicate with a radio disposed on an aircraft flying \n11 through respective cell coverage areas of the first and second base \nstations, and \nwherein the first and second base stations are each configured to \nhandover communication with the radio as the aircraft moves \nbetween the respective cell coverage areas of the first and second \nbase stations. \n'71 7 patent at claim 1. \nClaim 12 recites, in relevant part: \na first base station including a first antenna array defining a first \ndirectional radiation pattern that is oriented toward a horizon; and \na second base station including second antenna array defining a \nsecond directional radiation pattern that at least partially overlaps \nwith the first base station, \nwherein one of the first base station or the second base station \nemploys unlicensed spectrum , and the other of the first base station \nand the second base station employs licensed spectrum , \nwherein the first and second base stations are each configured to \nwirelessly communicate with a radio disposed on an aircraft flying \nthrough respective cell coverage areas of the first and second base \nstations, and \nwherein the first and second base stations are each configured to \nhandover communication with the radio as the aircraft moves \nbetween the respective cell coverage areas of the first and second \nbase stations. \n'717 patent at claim 12. \nAgain, based on the record before the Court at this time, there is no reason to depart from \nthe plain and ordinary meaning of the claim language. Aventis Pharm. Inc., 715 F.3d at 1373. \nAlthough the claim language recites \"a radio,\" such a construction requiring \"radio\" to be limited \nto \"a single radio disposed on the aircraft\" is contrary to the general rule that the \"words 'a' or 'an' \nin a patent claim carry the meaning of 'one or more.\"' See, e.g., 01 Communique Lab., Inc. v. \nLogMein, Inc., 687 F.3d 1292, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting TiVo, Inc. v. Echostar Commc'ns \nCorp., 516 F.3d 1290, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2008)). This construction is supported by the claims' later \nrecitation of \"the radio,\" which reinvokes its non-singular meaning. OJ Communique , 687 F.3d at \n12 1297 (quoting Baldwin Graphic Sys., Inc. v. Siebert, Inc., 512 F.3d at 1338, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2008)). \nAdditionally, the '717 patent's specification contemplates multiple radios, further supporting \nSmartSky's construction that \"a radio\" can mean \"one or more\" radios. See '717 patent at 9:40-\n46 (\"Moreover , it is to be appreciated that the radio(s) 416 can communicate using substantially \nany air interface in a licensed spectrum ( e.g., third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term \nevolution (LTE), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), and/or the like), \nunlicensed spectrum (e.g., 2.4 gigahertz (GHz), 5.8 GHz, and/or the like), etc.\"); see also id at \n6:25-28; 9:27-33. \nHowever, the '717 patent's plain and ordinary meaning of the first base station which \nemploys \"unlicensed\" spectrum and a second base station which employs \"licensed\" spectrum \nsupports Gogo' s proposed construction that the first base station solely employs unlicensed \nspectrum while the second base station solely employs licensed spectrum. SmartSky's own \nexpert's declaration supports this construction. See D.I. 26 at ,r 56 (\"The first base station employs \nunlicensed spectrum, and the second base station employs licensed spectrum.\"); id at ,r 83 (\"[T]he \nasserted '717 patent claims further specify that one base station employs unlicensed spectrum \nwhile another base station employs licensed spectrum. \"). \nNext, in considering Gogo's accused 5G Network, the parties provide competing analyses \nof how Gogo's aircraft radios and base stations operate. As Gogo concedes, its aircraft equipment \nconsists of multiple radios (D.1. 76 at 8; D.I. 79 at ,r,r 26-29; D.I. 77 at ,r,r 165-171), thus meeting \nthe \"one or more radios\" limitation based on this preliminary construction. Further, SmartSky \nargues that because Gogo's base stations have antennas supporting both the unlicensed spectrum \nand the licensed spectrum, Gogo' s handoffs necessaril y require a handoff between a first base \nstation employing licensed spectrum and a second base station employing unlicensed spectrum, \n13 even if the base stations support both spectrums. See D.I. 93 at 3-4; D.I. 94 at ,r,r 110-113. Gogo \nrefutes SmartSky's characterization, arguing that there are no handoffs between a first base station \nemploying solely unlicensed spectrum and a second base station solely employing licensed \nspectrum. D.I. 76 at 8; D.I. 77 at ,r,r 172-175, D.I. 79 at ,r 12. Further, Gogo contends that, although \nits base station antennas support both unlicensed and licensed spectrum , each of its two aircraft \nradios are solely dedicated to either the unlicensed or licensed spectrum. See D.I. 76 at 8; D.I. 79 \nat ,r 9. Thus, Gogo asserts that the handoffs must be between licensed-licensed or unlicensed\u00ad\nunlicensed, rather than cross-network handoffs, i.e., unlicensed to licensed, as required by the \nclaims 1 and 12 of the '717 patent. Id \nBased on the preliminary claim construction and factual disputes regarding how Gogo' s \n5G Network operates its handoffs, SmartSky has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating a \nlikelihood of success on the merits as to infringement of the '717 patent. Additionally , Gogo \ncontends that the '717 patent is invalid pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. The Court acknowledges the \nparties' arguments concerning the validity of the '717 patent but concludes that it is unnecessary \nto evaluate its validity in light of SmartSky 's failure to meet its burden of demonstrating a \nlikelihood of success as to infringement. See Mylan Institutional LLC v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, \n857 F.3d 858, 866 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (the patentee must show both that it will likely prove \ninfringement and that the claims will likely withstand the alleged infringer 's invalidity challenge ). \n3. The '077 Patent \nThe parties offer differing constructions of claims 1 and 2 of the '077 patent. SmartSky \nargues that the claims require a system comprised of A TG base stations functioning in an A TG \nnetwork. D.I. 24 at 9-10; D.I. 93 at 4. SmartSky also contends that the asserted claims on its face \ndo not require separately providing a terrestrial network comprised of terrestrial base stations. D.I. \n14 93 at 4. Gogo asserts that the plain language of the asserted claims require providing terrestrial \nbase stations within the 5G system. D.I. 76 at 8; see also Gogo's Motion to Dismiss SmartSky 's \nComplaint, D.I. 54, at 7-10.1 \nAt this stage and based on the present record, the Court cannot conclude that SmartSky has \ncarried its burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success as to its alleged infringement of the \n'077 patent in order to obtain the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction. The parties \nclearly contest the scope of claims 1 and 2 of the '077 patent, particularly whether the claims \nrequire providing terrestrial base stations. But, without the benefits of comprehensive claim \nconstruction briefing or a Markman hearing-especially considering the parties' scant briefing \nrelated to the scope of claims 1 and 2 of the '077 patent-the Court cannot conclude that SmartSky \nhas met its burden. \nMoreover, Gogo raises, at a minimum , substantial questions of validity related to the '077 \npatent. Gogo asserts that claims 1 and 2 of the '077 patent are likely obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n103 and, thus invalid, over a combination of two prior art references, U.S. Patent Application No. \n2006/0040660 (\"Cruz\") and U.S. Patent No. 5,444,762 (\"Frey\"). D.I. 76 at 11; D.I. 77 at ,r,r 103-\n108. Cruz purportedly discloses operating an ATG network containing networks of WiFi base \nstations (e.g., terrestrial base stations) near airports (D.I. 77 at ,r,r 108-110), while Frey allegedly \nteaches that ATG networks may use the same spectrum ( e.g., WiFi) employed by terrestrial base \nstations (D.I. 77 at ,r,r 111-112). Gogo contends, albeit in a conclusory fashion, that a skilled \nperson would be motivated to combine Cruz and Frey, which supplies each limitation required by \nthe '077 patent. D.I. 76 at 11; D.I. 77 at ,r,r 113-116. In response, SmartSky argues that Gogo's \n1 For purposes of deciding Smarksky 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction , the Court has not \nevaluated any arguments for, or against, granting Gogo's Motion to Dismiss SmartSky's \nComplaint. \n15 alleged motivation to combine Cruz and Frey is \"nonsensical \" because Cruz already solves the \nproblem of using common frequencies to avoid interference , and thus there is no reason to consult \nFrey. D.I. 93 at 5. Having reviewed the record, the Court concludes that SmartSky has not \ndemonstrated that Gogo's invalidity contention related to the '077 patent \"lacks substantial merit.\" \nSee Amazon.com , Inc., 239 F.3d at 1350. Particularl y, the Court finds that SmartSky has failed to \nmeaningfully address, beyond mere conclusory assertions , whether Cruz discloses a solution to \nthe interference problem that would obviate the motivation for a person skilled in the art to \ncombine the teachings of Frey to Cruz. \nii. Irreparable Harm \nThe movant seeking the preliminary injunction must demonstrate \"that it is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm if the preliminary injunction is not granted and there is a causal nexus between \nthe alleged infringement and the alleged harm.\" Meta/craft of Mayville, Inc. v. Toro Co., 848 F.3d \n1358, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2017). The alleged harm must not be compensable via monetary damages. \nId. (stating that, where no monetary damage is calculable , \"the harm cannot be adequately \ncompensated and is irreparable. \"). \nSmartSky asserts three grounds of irreparable harm as a result of Gogo' s alleged \ninfringement: (1) SmartSky will lose sales, market share, and its goodwill and reputation in the \nbusiness aviation industry; (2) Gogo competing for consumers would erode the price SmartSky \ncould charge without Gogo's competition; and (3) Gogo's competition will reduce SmartSky 's \nability to recoup its research and development (\"R&D\") costs and impair its ability to invest in \nfuture R&D. D.I. 24 at 11-18; D.I. 93 at 6-10. \nSmartSky alleges that Gogo is the only other provider of comparable business aviation \nnetwork services, and that allowing Gogo to compete with its allegedly infringing 5G Network \n16 would greatly reduce SmartSky's sales and profits. D.I. 24 at 12; D.I. 93 at 7-8. SmartSky further \nasserts that due to the nature of the consumer-provider relationship and the costs associated with \nswitching network providers, known as \"stickiness,\" lost sales and profits are incalculable. Id. \nGogo estimates that its consumer-relationships will last 17 years. Id.; see also D.l. 95 at ,r,r 5-20. \nFurther, as a result of SmartSky and Gogo's head-to-head competition and SmartSky's identity as \na \"disruptor\" in a small market, SmartSky claims it stands to lose a large share of the market. See \nD.I. 24 at 14-15; D.I. 93 at 8-9; D.I. 27 at ,r,r 34, 57. Due to SmartSky's loss of market exclusivity , \nit claims it will lose its earned reputation and goodwill as an \"innovator\" that arose from its years \nof developing a superior business aviation network. D.I. 24 at 15-16; D.I. 93 at 9. \nIn response, Gogo argues that SmartSky has produced no evidence of lost sales, and, if \nsales are indeed lost, they are calculable. D.I. 76 at 12-15; D.I. 78 at ,r,r 22-23. Notably, Gogo \ncites to SmartSky' s own expert, who concedes that the loss of equipment sales and service revenue \nassociated with consumers choosing Gogo through the date of trial can be determined and \nquantified as damages. D.I. 76 at 12 (citing D.I. 27 at ,r,r 40-42); see Automated Merch. Sys., Inc. \nv. Crane Co., 357 F. Appx. 297, 300-01 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (without more, lost sales are \"presumed \nto be compensable through damages. \"). Gogo further contends that any harm that may occur after \ntrial, such as consumers remaining with Gogo even if SmartSky prevails, is purely speculative and \ncannot support a preliminary injunction. D.I. 76 at 12-13; D.I. 78 at ,r,r 23-34; see IGTv. Aristocrat \nTechs., Inc., 646 F. Appx. 1015, 1018-19 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (multiple contingencies existing prior \nto a patentee experiencing alleged harm militates a finding of irreparable harm). \nFurthermore , Gogo asserts that SmartSky 's claim that it is a \"disruptor\" in the market and \nstands to lose a large share of the market are purely hypothetical claims about future market shares \nrather than supporting evidence of lost market share. D .I. 7 6 at 14-15; Abbott Cardiovascular Sys., \n17 research and development because such claims are highly speculative. See Eli Lilly & Co. v. Am. \nCyanamid Co., 82 F.3d 1568, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\"If a claim of lost opportunity to conduct \nresearch were sufficient to compel a finding of irreparable harm, it is hard to imagine any \nmanufacturer with a research and development program that could not make the same claim and \nthus be equally entitled to preliminary injunctive relief.\"). \nOn this record, SmartSky has established that it competes directly with Gogo as a business \naviation network provider, and that a loss of market share, and thus sales, to Gogo has the potential \nto be damaging due to the \"stickiness \" of the consumer . However , SmartSky has not demonstrated \nthat such losses are imminent as a result of Gogo's yet-to-be-released 5G Network or that its losses \nare non-compensable. In fact, Gogo has provided evidence demonstrating that regardless of \nGogo's promotion of its 5G Network, SmartSky has still secured investments and customers . See \nD.I. 76 at 16. SmartSky 's assertions that it stands to lose its reputation in the industry and its \nability to recoup its R&D investments to fund its complementary product, Skytelligence , (D.I. 24 \nat 15-16; D.I. 93 at 9-10) is speculative and cannot serve as the grounds for finding irreparable \nharm without additional evidence. See Eli Lilly & Co., 82 F.3d at 1578. \nGiven the above conclusions on the likelihood of success on the merits and on irreparable \nharm, the Court need not make any findings concerning the third and fourth factors. Polymer \nTechs., Inc. v. Bridwell, 103 F.3d 970, 973-74 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\"[A] trial court need not make \nfindings concerning the third and fourth factors if the moving party fails to establish either of the \nfirst two factors.\"). Thus, because SmartSky failed to establish the first two factors, i.e., likelihood \nof success on the merits and irreparable harm, the court denies SmartSky' s Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction. \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n19 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSMARTSKY NETWORKS , LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nGOGO BUSINESS AVIATION , LLC and \nGOGOINC. , \nDefendants. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 26th day of September 2022: Civil Action No. 22-266-GBW \nFor the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion issued this day, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that Defendants Gogo Business Aviation, LLC, and Gogo Inc.'s Motion to Strike \nImproper Reply Arguments from D.I. 85 and D.I. 86 (D.I. 97) is DENIED.
