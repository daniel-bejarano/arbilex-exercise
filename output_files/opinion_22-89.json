MOORE, \net al., \nDefendants . : Civil Action No. 22-89-RGA \nWardell Giles, Sussex Correctional Institution , Georgetown , Delaware . \nPro Se Plaintiff. \nMay 6, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Case 1:22-cv-00089-RGA   Document 9   Filed 05/06/22   Page 1 of 6 PageID #: 40Isl Richard G. Andrews \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge: \nPlaintiff Wardell Giles, an inmate at Sussex Correctional Institution in \nGeorgetown , Delaware , filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (0.1. 1 ). Plaintiff \nappears prose and proceeds in forma pauperis. The Court proceeds to screen the \nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a). \nBACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff alleges retaliation by Defendant Probation and \nParole when it declared Plaintiff a sex offender publicly and in written documents , \nknowing that he was not and knowing it defamed and slandered Plaintiff and placed his \nlife in danger. (0.1. 1 at 5-6). Plaintiff alleges that Probation admitted its mistake and \nindicated it would correct it once Plaintiffs attorney filed a motion that Plaintiff was not a \nsex offender. (Id. at 6). As of December 17, 2021, Plaintiff was still treated as a sex \noffender in society, open court, and in written records. (Id.). \nPlaintiff alleges that once he exposed the illegal actions of Probation and \nDefendant Officer Matthew Moore, Officer Moore and Probation retaliated against him \nand threatened him. (Id.). The Complaint does not described the alleged retaliatory \nactions. \nPlaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages , declaratory relief, and a \npublic apology. (Id. at 8). \n1 Case 1:22-cv-00089-RGA   Document 9   Filed 05/06/22   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 41SCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary \nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant) . The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nComplaint, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94. \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \n\"fantastic or delusional\" factual scenario.\"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscherv . McCullough , 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. \n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n2 Case 1:22-cv-00089-RGA   Document 9   Filed 05/06/22   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 42\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions . \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not \ndismissed , however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted. See id. at 11. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane \nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\" Id. \nDISCUSSION \nDefendant Moore. The Complaint contains one sentence that refers to Moore, \nas follows: \"Once I exposed ... Moore's illegal actions in court and in public [he] \n3 Case 1:22-cv-00089-RGA   Document 9   Filed 05/06/22   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 43retaliated against me and threatened me among other things that I will enlighten the \nCourt of when I become more knowledgeable to do so.\" (0.1. 1 at 6). \nLiability in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action is personal in nature, and to be liable, a \ndefendant must have been personally involved in the wrongful conduct. In other words, \ndefendants are \"liable only for their own unconstitutional conduct.\" Barkes v. First Corr. \nMed., Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 316 (3d Cir. 2014), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Taylor v. \nBarkes, 575 U.S. 822 (2015). The allegations of retaliation are conclusory. As alleged, \nI cannot discern if Moore had personal involvement in the alleged retaliation . Plaintiff \ndoes not explain what Moore actually did to retaliate against Plaintiff. There are simply \nno facts supporting the claim against Moore. Therefore, Moore will be dismissed as a \ndefendant. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend the claim. \nProbation and Parole. Plaintiffs claims against Probation and Parole are barred \nby the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity . See MCI Telecom. Corp. v. Bell At/. of \nPa., 271 F.3d 491, 503 (3d Cir. 2001 ). The Office of Probation and Parole falls under \nthe umbrella of the Delaware Department of Correction , a state agency. See Boone v. \nProbation & Parole of New Castle Cty., 2019 WL 1792300 , at* 3 (D. Del. Apr. 24, \n2019). \nThe Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution protects a \nnonconsenting state or state agency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its \nown citizens, regardless of the relief sought. See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman , 465 U.S. 89 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). Delaware \nhas not waived its immunity from suit in federal court. Although Congress can abrogate \na state's sovereign immunity, it did not do so through the enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n4 Case 1:22-cv-00089-RGA   Document 9   Filed 05/06/22   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 441983. See Brooks-McCollum v. Delaware , 213 F. App'x 92, 94 (3d Cir. 2007). In \naddition, dismissal is proper because Probation and Parole is not a person for purposes \nof\u00a7 1983. See Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989); Calhoun \nv. Young, 288 F. App'x 47 (3d Cir. 2008). \nTherefore , the Court will dismiss the claims against Probation and Parole as it is \nimmune from suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(2). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss the Complaint for failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted and based upon immunity from suit \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) and (2). Plaintiff will \nbe given leave to amend the claim against Moore. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n5 Case 1:22-cv-00089-RGA   Document 9   Filed 05/06/22   Page 6 of 6 PageID #: 45"}
