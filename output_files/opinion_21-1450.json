Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \n Before me is Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss  Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint.  (D.I. 12).  I have \nconsidered the parties\u2019 briefing.   (D.I. 13, 20, 21).  \nI. BACKGROUND1  \nPlaintiff John Doe (\u201cDoe\u201d) was  employed by New Castle County ( \u201cthe Cou nty\u201d) as a \nTrades Helper in the Plant Operations/Treatment Division of the County\u2019s  Department of Public \nWorks  (\u201cDPW\u201d) .  (D.I. 3 at \u00b6 5 ).  When he started this position on October 21, 2019, his work \nconsisted of  \u201cpull[ing]  pumps out of the sewer system for repair.\u201d   (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 16 \u201317).  He \nimmediately noticed various safety issues  in the workshop, including: \u201c(a) a tripod used to lower \nmen down into the sewer system to retrieve pumps; (b) a lack of adequate fall protection gear; \n(c) lifting straps that were used beyond their useful life; and (d) homemade fittings/rings placed on oxygen tanks that were used by cranes to lift the tanks.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 17).  He raised these safety \nconcerns to many of his co- workers and supervisors , who simply told Doe that OSHA \nrequirements do not apply to the County.  (Id. at \u00b6 18).  \nDoe was  later  assigned to assist Herb Coates (\u201cCoates\u201d) , a Pump Station Mechanic, in the \nairport shop.  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201319).  During this time , Coates repeatedly used  an offensive  term to \nrefer to homosexual  firefighters  \u201caround \u201d Doe, who is a volunteer firefighter.\n2  (Id. at \u00b6 22 ).  \nDoe reported Coates\u2019 offensive language to James O\u2019Hara , the Facility Maintenance Supervisor, \nand Regis Yurich, the Chief of Facility Operations .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 22).  They responded only \n \n1 I state the facts as alleged by Plaintiff and in the light most favorable to him.  \n2 Doe is a heterosexual male and is  married to a woman.  (D.I. 3 at \u00b6 1).  Based on Coates\u2019 \ncomments and Kratzer\u2019s actions  (discussed infra ), Doe claims that they perceived him to be \nhomosexual.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 38, 72, 121). 2 that this was \u201cjust Herbie being Herbie.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 22).  On  December 12, 2019, Doe told \nCoates about his various  safety concerns around the shop.  (Id. at \u00b6 19).  The exchange became \ncontentious, and Coates accused Doe of threatening him.   (Id.).  As a result of this incident, \nDoe receiv ed a written disciplinary warning on December 19, 2019.  (Id. at \u00b6 21) . \nBecause of this disciplinary action , Doe was transferred the same day to work under \nGarrett Kratzer  (\u201cKratzer\u201d) , a mechanic in DPW.  ( Id. at \u00b6 23).  After Doe\u2019s transfer, \u201csomeone \nat the County [asked Doe] if he was having any problems working with Kratzer.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 24).  \nKratzer frequen tly used offensive language around his co- workers.  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26) .  For \nexample, Kratzer made inappropriate comments to a female instructor during a sexual \nharassment seminar.  ( Id. at \u00b6 25(c)).  Kratzer told Doe that two individuals had assisted \nKratzer prior to Doe \u2014\u201cone of the men had asked to be transferred, \u201d and \u201cthe other man who \nheld the position hanged himself.\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 27 ).  Kratzer also told Doe that he had previously \nbeen fired fr om a position with the City of New Castle due to his \u201cpersonality disorder.\u201d   (Id. at \n\u00b6 28).   \nKnowing that  Doe was married to a Filipino woman, Kratzer  made Asian slurs on at least \nsix occasions to Doe.  (Id. at \u00b6 30).   \nWhile  on a job site, Kratzer \u201c caressed \u201d Doe\u2019s arm.  ( Id. at \u00b6 32).  A week later, \u201cKrat zer \ngrabbed [Doe ]\u2019s chest.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 33).  A few weeks later, on January 14, 2020, Kratzer climbed \non Doe\u2019s back and \u201cput his erect penis on [Doe] \u2019s butt.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 35).  Kratzer told Doe  on \nmultiple  subsequent  occasions  that he wanted to have sex with  Doe.  ( Id. at \u00b6 36).   On January \n24, 2020, while Doe and Kratzer were returning from a job site, Kratzer again made the same \nsexually explicit comment to Doe.   (Id. at \u00b6 37 ). 3  After th e January 24, 2020 incident, Doe reported Kratzer\u2019s  actions to the New Castle \nCounty Police Department.  (Id. at \u00b6 39 ).  Doe never reported Kratzer\u2019s harassment  to the \nCounty because he was previously disciplined after raising safety concerns to Coates .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n32, 40) .  Once the County was notified of  Doe\u2019s police complaint, the County investigated and \ntold Doe  that they  were \u201cunable to substantiate the allegations.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 46).   \nDoe did not return to work after January 24, 2020.  (Id. at \u00b6 42 ).  He  was placed on \nunpaid medical leave after providing the County with a medical note.  ( Id. at \u00b6 45).  The \nCounty \u201cnever offered for [Doe] to transfer to another department ,\u201d and thus, if Doe returned to \nwork  in the same department , he would have had to see Kratzer daily.   (Id. at \u00b6 47).  Doe\u2019s \nphysician advised Doe not to return to work for the County based on his anxiety and post -\ntraumatic stress disorder related to his employment.  ( Id. at \u00b6 48).  Based on this \nrecommendation, Doe resigned effective June 2, 2020.  ( Id. at \u00b6 49).  \nOn October 14, 2021, Doe filed this action  against the County, Coates, and Kratzer .  \n(Id.).  Doe\u2019s C omplaint raises the following counts:  \nI. Title VII Retaliation against the County ; \nII. Hostile Work Environment (race and national origin)  against the County;   \nIII. Hostile Work Environment (gender)  against the County;  \nIV. Hostile Work Environment (sex and sexual orientation)  against the  County;   \nV. Constructive Discharge against the County;   \nVI. Title VII Retaliation against the County ; \nVII. Failure to A ccommodate under the ADA against the County;  \nVIII. First Amendment Retaliation (sexual harassment) against the County;   \nIX. First Amendment Retaliation (safety concerns) against the County;   \nX. Violation of the Delaware Whistleblower s\u2019 Protection Act against the Count y;  4 XI. Substantive Due Process (sexual orientation)  against Coates ; \nXII. Equal Protection (sexual orientation)  against Coates ; \nXIII. Substantive Due Process (sexual orientation)  against Kratzer ; and  \nXIV. Substantive Due Process (race and national origin)  against Kratzer . \n \nDefendants have moved to dismiss all fourteen counts.  (D.I. 12).  In his answering \nbrief, Doe  withdr ew Count VII with prejudice and Counts VIII and IX without prejudice.  (D.I. \n20 at 2).  I will therefore grant the motion to dismiss with respect to Counts  VII, VIII, and IX.  I \nwill address the remaining counts below.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nRule 8 requires a complainant to provide \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).  Rule 12(b)(6) allows the \naccused party to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to meet this standard.  A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well -pleaded allegations in the complaint \nas true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that \nthose allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \nThe factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than \nlabels, conclusions, or a \u201cformulaic recitation\u201d of the claim elements.  Id. at 555 (\u201cF actual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . on the \nassumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d).  \nMoreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a  facially plausible claim to relief.  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when \nthe complaint\u2019s factual content \u201callows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the 5 defendant is liable for the m isconduct alleged.\u201d  Id. (\u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Retaliation Claims (Counts I and VI)  \nTo state a claim for retaliation under Title VII, a plaintif f must allege  that: \u201c(1) [he]  \nengaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action against [him] ; and (3) there was a causal connection between [his] participation in the protected \nactivity and the adverse employment action.\u201d   Moore v. City of Phila ., 461 F.3d 331, 340\u201341 \n(3d Cir. 2006)  (citation omitted).  \nCount I of the Complaint  alleges  that the County retaliated against Doe  by reassigning \nhim to work with Kratzer  after Doe report ed Coate s\u2019 sexually offensive comments .  (D.I. 3 at \u00b6 \n52).  The  County argues  that Count  I should be  dismissed  because Doe  fails  to allege an  \n\u201cadverse employment  action.\u201d   (D.I.  13 at 5\u20136).  \nAn adverse action  for retaliation  is not limited  to actions  that affect  a plaintiff\u2019s  \nemployment  status.   See Burlington N.  & Santa Fe  Ry. Co. v.  White , 548 U.S. 53, 62\u201364 (2006)  \n(\u201c[T]he antiretaliation provision, unlike the [antidiscrimination] provision, is not limited to \ndiscriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d).  Retaliation  \nsimply requires that a \u201creasonable employee would have found the challenged a ction materially \nadverse .  . . mean[ing] it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or \nsupporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d   Id. at 68 (citation  and quotation marks omitted). \nDoe alleges that the County \u201cknew that Kratzer was difficult  to work with and would \nmake [Doe]\u2019s working conditions miserable.\u201d  ( D.I. 3 at \u00b6 53) .  For instance , Kratzer openly 6 used offensive language  in front of his colleagues , and his first two assistants had left the \nposition.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 25 \u201328).   I find that Doe has plausibly alleged that his transfer to work under \nKratzer , who was known to be difficult, was an adverse employment action .  Jones  v. Sch.  Dist.  \nof Phila ., 198 F.3d 403, 412 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that a teacher had suffered  an adverse \nemployment action  when he was transferred to a different school  and required \u201cto teach what he \nregarded as less desirable science classes\u201d);  Sims  v. Peace of  Mind  Living  Habilitative  Servs.,  \nLLC, 2021 WL 5629974, at *11 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 1, 2021)  (holding that the plaintiff\u2019s transfer  \nfrom one set of clients to a more difficult set of clients was an adverse employment action).  \nThe County also argues that Doe fails to allege  facts supporting a  causal connection \nbetween the protected activity and the adverse action.  (D.I. 13 at 6).  \u201cA causal link between \nprotected activity and adverse action may be inferred from an unusually suggestive temporal \nproximity between the two, an inter vening pattern of antagonism following the protected \nconduct, or the proffered evidence examined as a whole.\u201d   Phifer  v. Sevenson  Env\u2019t Servs.,  Inc., \n2012 WL 868692, at *7 (D. Del. Mar. 14, 2012)  (citing  Kachmar  v. SunGard Data  Sys., Inc. , \n109 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir. 1997) ), aff\u2019d, 619 F. App\u2019 x 153 (3d Cir. 2015) . \nDoe alleges, \u201cIn hindsight, [Doe] may have been paired with Kratzer in retaliation for \nraising safety concerns and/or raising concerns about being called\u201d a sexually offensive term. \n(D.I. 3 at \u00b6 23).  This conclusory allegation is insufficient to  state a causal connection.  Further, \nthere are no allegations to demonstrate an  \u201cunusually suggestive temporal proximity\u201d between \nthe protected activity  and the adverse action.  The C omplaint  merely alleges that Doe reported \nCoates\u2019 offensive language on an unspeci fied date , so the temporal relationship is vague .  (Id. at \n\u00b6 22) .  The  Complaint instead provides a non -actionable reason that is more suggestive of the \ntransfer.  Doe was transferred the same day that he was disciplined after rais ing safety concerns 7 to Coates.   (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23).  Because Doe has failed to allege a causal link between the \nprotected activity and adverse action, I will grant the motion to dismiss Count I  without \nprejudice . \nCount VI alleges that the County retaliated against Doe for reporting Kratzer\u2019s sexual \nharassment when \u201c[t]he County did not offer a transfer of position to [Doe]  and instead insisted \nthat he must remain with his harasser.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 87).  The County argu es that its failure to offer \na transfer is not an adverse action under Title VII.   (D.I. 13 at 6\u20137).   Doe responds that courts in \nthis district have  held that  an employer\u2019s  failure to transfer an employee can be an adverse \naction.  (D.I. 20 at 11).  But th e cases cited by Doe involved denials of requested transfers.  \nSee, e.g., Parker  v. State  of Del.,  Dep \u2019t of Pub. Safety , 11 F. Supp. 2d 467, 478\u201379 (D. Del. \n1998).  That is not the case here.  There are no allegations that Doe requested a transfer.   \nInstead, the C omplaint alleges that Doe did not return to work after January 24, 2020, based  on \nthe recommendation of his physician.  (D.I. 3 at \u00b6\u00b6 42 \u201343).  The County\u2019s failure to unilaterally \noffer Doe a transfer out of the division is not an adverse action.  Thus, I will dismiss Count VI  \nwithout prejudice . \nB. Hostile Work Environment  Claims  (Counts II, III, and IV ) \nTo state a claim for  hostile work environment  under Title VII, a plaintiff must allege  that: \n(1) he suffered intentional discriminati on because of his protected characteristic, (2) \u201c the \ndiscrimination was severe or pervasive, \u201d (3) he was detrimentally affected by the discrimination , \n(4) \u201cthe discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person in like circumstances, \u201d \nand (5) \u201cthe existence of respondeat  superior  liability. \u201d  Mandel  v. M & Q Packaging Corp., \n706 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir. 2013) . 8  Count II is  based upon Kratzer\u2019s harassment relating to the race and national origin  of \nDoe\u2019s wife .  (D.I. 3 at \u00b6\u00b6 57 \u201361).  Counts III and IV are based upon Kratzer\u2019s harassment \nbecause of Doe\u2019s gender, sex, and perceived sexual orientation.  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 65 \u201368, 72\u201375).   \nThe County argues t hat Counts II, III, and IV should be dismissed because Doe cannot \ndemonstrate respondeat superior  liability.  (D.I. 13 at 12\u201313) .  The basis for  an employer\u2019s \nliability depends  on whether the harasser was the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor or a non- supervisory co -\nworker.   Huston v.  Procter  & Gamble  Paper  Prod s. Corp., 568 F.3d 100, 104 (3d Cir. 2009) .  \nIf the harasser is the victim\u2019s  supervisor, then the employer may be strictly liable  if the \nharassment \u201c culminates in a tangible employment action .\u201d  Vance  v. Ball  State  Univ. , 570 U.S. \n421, 424 (2013) .  Doe has failed to allege that Kratzer was his supervisor, so t his Court instead \napplies the standard for employer liability for a non- supervisory co -worker\u2019s  harassment . \n\u201cWhen the hostile work environment is created by a victim \u2019s non- supervisory coworkers, \nthe employer is not automatically liable. \u201d  Huston, 568 F.3d at  104.  \u201c Rather,  employer  liability  \nfor co -worker  harassment  exists  only if  the employer  failed  to provide  a reasonable  avenue for \ncomplaint  or, alternatively,  if the employer  knew  or should have  known of  the harassment  and \nfailed  to take prompt  and appropriate  remedial  action .\u201d  Id.  In other words, \u201c an employer  may  \nbe directly  liable  for non- supervisory co -worker  sexual  harassment  only if  the employer  was \nnegligent  in failing  to discover  the co-worker  harassment  or in responding to  a report  of such  \nharas sment.\u201d   Id. at 104\u201305. \nDoe did not report Kratzer\u2019s harassment to the County.  (D.I. 3 at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 33, 35, 40).  \nDoe argues that the County knew or should have known that Kratzer would harass and terrorize \nDoe because: (1) \u201cKratzer had been through a number of assistants/helpers before Doe, one of \nwhom reportedly committed suicide and one of whom was transferred \u201d; (2) \u201c Kratzer had been 9 terminated from a previous position with the City of New Castle \u201d; (3) after Doe\u2019s transfer, a \nCounty employee asked Do e whether he  was having any  problems with Kratzer ; (4) Kratzer \nopenly used offensive language  in front of his co -workers ; and (5) Kratzer  made inappropriate \ncomments to a female instructor at a sexual harassment seminar  in front of his co- workers .  (D.I. \n20 at 8 \u20139).  None of these actions, however, are specific to Doe and the racial and sexual \nharassment here.   While these allegations support the inference that the County knew Kratzer \nwas a difficult and unpleasant person to work with, the y do not support a n inference that the \nCounty knew that Kratzer  was sexually and racially harassing Doe.  Thus, Doe has failed to \nallege a basis for employer liability .  I will grant the motion to dismiss Counts II, III, and IV  \nwithout prejudice .3 \nC. Constructive Discharge  Claim  (Count V) \nA claim for constructive discharge exists when  \u201cthe employer knowingly permitted \nconditions of discrimination in employment so intolerable that a reasonable person subject to \nthem would resign.\u201d   Mandel , 706 F.3d at  169 (citation omitted).   \u201cTo prove constructive \ndischarge, the plaintiff must demonstrate a greater severity or pervasiveness of harassment than \n \n3 The County also argues that Counts III and IV should be dismissed because Doe has failed to \nallege facts establishing that the discrimination was based on his gender and sex.   (D.I. 13 at 13\u2013\n14).  Although I have dismissed Counts III and IV on other grounds, I do find that  Doe has \nplausibly alleged that Kratzer\u2019s repeated sexual advances were sex -based.   See Durham  Life Ins. \nCo. v.  Evans , 166 F.3d 139, 148 (3d Cir. 1999) ( \u201cWe generally presume that sexual advances . . . \nare sex -based, whether the motivation is desire or hatred.\u201d ); Andrews  v. City  of Phila ., 895 F.2d \n1469, 1482 n.3 (3d Cir. 1990) (\u201c The intent to discriminate on the basis of sex in cases involving \nsexual propositions, innuendo, pornographic materials, or sexual derogatory language is implicit, \nand thus should be recognized as a matter of course.\u201d), superseded by statute on other grounds , \nCivil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102- 166, 105 Stat. 1072, as recognized in Moody v. Atl. \nCity B d. of Educ ., 870 F.3d 206 (3d Cir. 2017). 10 the minimum required to prove a hostile working environment.\u201d   Spencer  v. Wal-Mart  Stores, \nInc., 469 F.3d 311, 316 n.4 (3d Cir. 2006)  (citation omitted) . \nThe County only seeks dismissal of Doe\u2019s constructive discharge claim under the so -\ncalled Faragher -Ellerth  affirmative defense.  (See D.I.  13 at 16 \u201317; D.I. 20 at 12\u201313).   To \nestablish this defense, an employer must show: \u201c(1)  that it had  installed  a readily  accessible and  \neffective policy for reporting and  resolving complaints  of sexual  harassment,  and (2) that  the \nplaintiff  unreasonably failed  to avail  [himself]  of that employer -provided preventive  or remedial  \napparatu s.\u201d  Pa. State  Police  v. Suders , 542 U.S. 129, 134 (2004) . \nAn affirmative  defense may not be used  to dismiss  a complaint  under  Rule  12(b)(6) \nunless  that defense appears  on the  face of  the complaint.  Victaulic  Co. v.  Tieman , 499 F.3d 227, \n234 (3d Cir. 2007)  (citation omitted) .  The Faragher -Ellerth  defense does not appear on the face \nof Doe\u2019s C omplaint.  There are  no allegations  regarding  the County\u2019s  policy for reporting  sexual  \nharassment  and there  are unresolved factual  dispute s regarding the  reasonab leness  of Doe\u2019s  \ndecision  not to report  Kratzer\u2019s  harassment.   See, e.g., Minarsky  v. Susquehanna Cnty. , 2016 \nWL 164307, at *5 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 13, 2016)  (\u201cWhat the County knew, when it knew it, and what \nit did in response, as well as what Plaintiff did or did not do and why, are key factual elements of \nthe Faragher -Ellerth  defense.\u201d).   I therefore deny the County\u2019s motion to dismiss Count V . \nD. Claim Under D elaware Whistleblower s\u2019 Protection Act  (Count X)  \nUnder the Delaware Whistleblowers \u2019 Protection Act ( \u201cDWPA \u201d): \nAn employer shall not discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against an \nemployee regarding the employee \u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, location, or \nprivileges of employment : . . . [b]ecause the employee reports verbally or in writing \nto the employer or to the employee \u2019s supervisor a violation, which the employee \nknows or reasonably believes has occurred or is about to occur  . . . .  \n 11 DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 19, \u00a7 1703(4).  To state a claim under the DWPA, Doe must allege that: \n\u201c(1) [he] engaged in a protected whistleblowing activity; (2) the accused official knew of the \nprotected activity; (3) [Doe]  suffered  an adverse employment action; and (4) there is a causal \nconnection between the whistleblowing activity and the adverse action. \u201d  Chance  v. Kraft  Heinz  \nFoods  Co., 2018 WL 6655670, at *10 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 17, 2018) . \n The County argues that Doe has failed to allege an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d   (D.I. \n13 at 18).  Doe argues that  his transfer to work with Kratzer after Doe reported safety violations \nto Coates and Coates\u2019 superiors is an adverse employment action under the DWPA.  (D.I. 20 at \n14; see also D.I. 3 at \u00b6 118).   DWPA  prohibits employers from \u201cdischarg[ing], threaten[ing], or \notherwise discriminat[ing] against an employee regarding the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, \nconditions, location, or privileges of employment.\u201d4  D EL. CODE ANN. tit. 19, \u00a7 1703.  At this \nstage, Doe plausibly alleges an adverse employment action under this standard.  As discussed above with respect to Doe\u2019s retaliation claims, the re are allegations supporting the inference that \nthe County kne w Kratzer was difficult to work with.  The transfer of Doe to work with a more \ndifficult co -worker may  constitute \u201c discriminat[ing]  against an employee regarding the \nemployee\u2019s  terms, conditions, . . . or privileges of employment.\u201d   Thus, I deny the motion to \ndismiss Count X.  \n \n4 This language is similar to the definition of \u201cadverse employment action\u201d in the context of Title \nVII\u2019s antidiscrimination provision .  See Storey  v. Burns  Int\u2019l Sec.  Servs. , 390 F.3d 760, 764 (3d \nCir. 2004) (\u201c We have defined \u2018an adverse employment action\u2019 under Title VII as an action by an \nemployer that is \u2018 serious and tangible enough to alter an employee \u2019s compensation, terms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment.\u2019 \u201d (citat ion omitted) ). 12 E. Section 1983 Claims  (Counts XI \u2013XIV)  \nDoe brings a  substantive due process claim (Count XI) and an equal protection claim \n(Count XII) against Coates for his comments related to Doe\u2019s perceived sexual orientation.  Doe \nalso asserts two substantive due process claims against Kratzer  for his harassment  relati ng to \nDoe\u2019s perceived sexual orientation (Count XIII) and his wife\u2019s race  and national origin (Count \nXIV).  \nTo state a \u00a7 1983 claim, \u201ca plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was \ncommitted by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d  West  v. Atkins , 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) .  \nA defendant acts under the color of state law when the defendant  \u201cexercised power \u2018possessed by \nvirtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of \nstate law.\u2019\u201d  Bonenberger  v. Plymouth Twp., 132 F.3d 20, 23 (3d Cir. 1997)  (quoting West , 487 \nU.S. at 49) . \n\u201cIt is well settled that an otherwise private tort is not committed under color of law \nsimply because the tortfeasor is an employee of the state. \u201d  Mark  v. Borough of  Hatboro, 51 \nF.3d 1137, 1150 (3d Cir. 1995) .  \u201cFor instance, a state employee who pursues purely private \nmotives and whose interaction with the vict im is unconnected with his execution of official \nduties does not act under color of law.\u201d  Bonenberger , 132 F.3d at 24;  see also  Barkauskie  v. \nIndian River  Sch. Dist. , 951 F. Supp. 519, 541 (D. Del. 1996) (\u201c[S]exual  harassment  of one state  \nemployee  by her  co-workers  falls  on the  side of personal  pursuits  rather  than  acts under  color  of \nlaw.\u201d). \n A defendant\u2019s sexual harassment , however, can be under color of state law where the \ndefendant  has supervisory control over the victim.   Bonenberger , 132 F.3d at 23\u201325 ( \u201cIf a state  13 entity  places  an official  in the position of  supervising a  lesser -ranking employee  and empowers  \nhim or her to give  orders which  the subordinate  may  not disobey without  fear of formal  reprisal,  \nthat official  wields  sufficient  authority to  satisfy  the color  of law requirement  of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1983.\u201d ).  For example, in Bonenberger , a female police dispatcher brought a \u00a7 1983 sexual \nharassment claim against the police officer who regularly supervised her shift.  Id. at 22.  \nAlthough the police officer had no power to fire the plaintiff, he could control her workload and \ncould begin a disciplinary process if the plaintiff did not  follow his orders.  Id. at 23 \u201324.  The \nThird Circuit held that the police officer wielded sufficient supervisory authority over  the \nplaintiff to satisfy the  \u00a7 1983 color of law requirement.   Id. at 24 \u201325. \nKratzer and Coates argue that Doe has failed to allege that they had supervisory control \nover Doe, and thus, Doe has failed to allege facts demonstrating that Kratzer and Coates were \nacting under the color of state law.  (D.I. 21 at 6\u2013 7).  The two relevant  paragraphs of the \nComplaint provide:  \u201cDoe was assigned at one point to assist Herb Coates in the airport shop.\u201d \n(D.I. 3 at \u00b6 19 ); and \u201cDoe was transferred to work under Kratzer, a mechanic in DPW.\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 \n23).  These allegations alone are insufficient to support an inference that Coates and Kratzer had \nsupervisory control over Doe.  Thus, I grant  the motion to dismiss Counts XI \u2013XIV  without \nprejudice .5  See Houlihan v.  Sussex  Tech.  Sch.  Dist. , 461 F. Supp. 2d 252, 261\u201362 (D. Del. \n2006) (granting motion to dismiss where the plaintiff failed to allege that the defendant \u201chad any supervisor power over [ the plaintiff\u2019s] daily activities\u201d) . \n \n5 Because I will grant the motion to dismiss Counts XI \u2013XIV on these grounds , I need not \naddress Kratzer and Coates \u2019 conclusory argument that they are entitled to qualified immunity.  \n(D.I. 1 3 at 15 \u201316).  14 IV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will issue.  \n \n "}
