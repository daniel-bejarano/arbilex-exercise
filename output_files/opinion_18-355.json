{"case_name": "Mayhan v. Sunoco Inc", "case_number": "18-355", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "01-12-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nDEBORAH J. MAYHAN , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nSUNOCO , INC., \nDefendant. : Civil Action No. 18-355-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington this 12th day of January, 2022, having considered Plaintiff's motion \nto reopen the case (D.I. 62); \nIT IS ORDERED that motion (D.I. 62) is DENIED, for the reasons that follow: \nPlaintiff commenced this action on March 6, 2018. (D. I. 2) During the course of \nthis litigation I have entered five show cause orders, all directed to Plaintiff. (D.I. 16, \n19, 22, 52, 58) The last show cause order, entered on February 12, 2021, ordered \nPlaintiff to show cause or before March 12, 2021, why the Court should not enforce its \nJanuary 16, 2020 Order (D.I. 47) compelling arbitration and placed Plaintiff on notice \nthat her failure to respond to the Show Cause Order would be considered a failure to \nprosecute and would result in dismissal of the case. \nPlaintiff did not file a timely response to the Show Cause order, and on March 23, \n2021, the Complaint was dismissed without prejudice for Plaintiffs failure to prosecute . \n(D.I. 60). On March 25, 2021, Plaintiff filed a belated response to the show cause \norder. (D. I. 61). Therein she stated that Defendant gave her incorrect information , \n1 provided false statements to the Court, attempted to manipulate the Court by denying \nher due process, did not challenge any of the claims in the case, and that the case has \nbeen very stressful. (/d.). \nOn June 4, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case due to a \"death in the \nfamily.\" (0.162 at 1). The funeral service was held in California on March 19, 2021. \n(0.1. 62-1 at 1). The motion also states that the order Plaintiff received indicates she \nwas to file before March 26, 2021 and she filed on March 25, 2021. (0.1. 62 at 1 ). \nPlaintiffs is incorrect that her response to the show cause order was due by \nMarch 26, 2021. Plaintiffs response was due on March 12, 2021. (0.1. 58). Her motion \nto reopen seems to imply that she did not file the response because she attended the \nfuneral of a family member on March 19, 2021, one week after the filing deadline. She \ndoes not explain why March 19, 2021 funeral service affected her ability to file a \nresponse that was due one week earlier. Nor did Plaintiff seek an extension of time to \nfile her response, a response that was filed almost two weeks late. On the other hand, \nshe also seems to imply that she was mistaken as to when the response was due. In \neither event, Plaintiff then waited until June 4, 2021, more than two months later, to \nmove to reopen the case. \nPlaintiff provides no basis to reopen the case. Therefore , Plaintiffs motion to \nreopen will be denied. \n2 "}
