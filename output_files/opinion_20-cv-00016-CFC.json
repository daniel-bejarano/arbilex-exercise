Connolly", "date": "12-27-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nPOWER SYSTEMS\nTECHNOLOGIES, LTD.,\n\nPlaintiff,\nCivil Action No. 20-16-CFC\nv.\n\nJMC PLATFORM FUND I-A, L.P.,\n\nDefendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nPlaintiff Power Systems Technology LTD. (PSTL) has sued Defendant JMC\nPlatform Fund I-A, L.P. to collect payment under a guaranty agreement. D.I. 29.\nPending before me are JMC\u2019s First Motion for Summary Judgment (No Breach),\nD.I. 92, and JMC\u2019s Second Motion for Summary Judgment (Lack of Standing),\nD.I. 96. Because both motions are predicated on the same theory, I will address\nthem together here.\n\nL BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are undisputed. Unipower, LLC and PSTL entered into\nan Agreement for Manufacturing Services (MSA) effective July 15, 2016. DI.\n123 9 1. On December 5, 2017, PSTL and JMC entered into a second amended\n\nguaranty agreement, under which JMC is liable for the Guaranteed Obligations.\nD.I. 123 \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. The Guaranteed Obligations are any amount \u201cdue and payable by\nUnipower . .. to PSTL pursuant to a bona fide invoice issued by PSTL to\nUnipower under, and in accordance with\u201d the MSA. D.I. 123 94. PSTL assigned\nall rights, titles, and interests in any amounts due and payable by Unipower to Flex\nJersey Limited. D.I. 123 \u00a7 6. PSTL has now sued JMC under the guaranty\nagreement to collect the payment that PSTL alleges Unipower failed to make\nwithin 30 days of notice of default. D.I. 29.\n\nIl. LEGALSTANDARDS\nA. Summary Judgment\n\nA court must grant summary judgment \u201cif the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \u201cthat could affect\nthe outcome\u201d of the proceeding. Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.\n2011). \u201c[A] dispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to\npermit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d Jd. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A non-moving party asserting that a fact is genuinely\ndisputed must support such an assertion by: \u201c(A) citing to particular parts of\nmaterials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored\ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, . .. admissions, interrogatory\n\nanswers, or other materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the\n\nopposing party] do not establish the absence ... of a genuine dispute... .\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(c)(1). The non-moving party\u2019s evidence \u201cmust amount to more than a\nscintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than a\npreponderance.\u201d Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, 460-61\n(3d Cir. 1989).\n\nlil. DISCUSSION\n\nJMC\u2019s two motions are both based on the same underlying theory: PSTL\u2019s\nassignment of its interest in receivables to Flex Jersey extinguished PSTL\u2019s\nownership interest in those invoices. D.I. 94 at 2; DI. 97 at 1. In its first summary\njudgment motion, JMC argues that PSTL\u2019s claims are not for amounts due and\npayable to PSTL as required by the guaranty agreement with JMC, so no\nreasonable factfinder could find that JMC breached its contract with PSTL. D.I. 94\nat 2. In its second summary judgment motion, JMC argues that PSTL\u2019s\nassignment extinguished any claims PSTL had to the receivables, so PSTL has no\nstanding to sue. D.I. 97 at 1.\n\nIn response, PSTL offers additional documents detailing a servicer\nagreement between PSTL and Flex Jersey. See generally DI. 123. PSTL argues\nthat these documents show (1) that PSTL has standing to sue to collect the\nreceivables on Flex Jersey\u2019s behalf, D.I. 122 at 2, and (2) that JMC has breached\n\nthe guaranty agreement because PSTL may enforce the agreement as Flex Jersey\u2019s\nservicer, D.I. 120 at 2. JMC disputes the authenticity of PSTL\u2019s additional\ndocuments. D.I. 140 at 1-4; D.I. 142 at 1-4.\n\nA. Authenticity of PSTL\u2019s Documents\n\u201cFacts supporting summary judgment must be capable of being \u2018presented in\n\n2\n\na form that would be admissible in evidence.\u2019\u201d Bacon v. Avis Budget Grp., Inc.,\n959 F.3d 590, 603 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2)). \u201cTo satisfy\nthe requirement of authenticating .. . evidence, the proponent must produce\nevidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims\nitis.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). JMC argues that the two documents produced by\nPSTL are \u201cfacially inauthentic\u201d because neither \u201cincludes a signature page or\nattestation.\u201d D.I. 140 at 3. Further, JMC faults PSTL for its \u201cattempted\nauthentication\u201d by \u201can associate attorney at PSTL\u2019s outside law firm\u201d because the\nattorney is \u201cnot competent to authenticate any PSTL document\u2014now or at trial.\u201d\nD.I. 140 at 4.\n\nBut the Third Circuit has \u201crepeatedly noted that the burden of proof for\nauthentication is slight.\u201d Lexington Ins. Co. v. W. Pennsylvania Hosp., 423 F.3d\n318, 328 (3d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and original alterations omitted).\n\u201cThe showing of authenticity is not on a par with more technical evidentiary rules,\n\nsuch as hearsay exceptions, governing admissibility. Rather, there need be only a\n\nprima facie showing, to the court, of authenticity, not a full argument on\n\nadmissibility.\u201d Id. at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted; original emphasis).\nAnd the Third Circuit has found that circumstantial evidence, such as a document\nbeing produced pursuant to discovery requests, can create a \u201csufficient foundation\nfor a jury to determine that th[e] document is what it is purported to be.\u201d Id.\nPSTL\u2019s additional documents (titled \u201cThird Amended and Restated\nServicing Agreement\u201d and \u201cFourth Amended and Restated Servicing Agreement\u201d)\nappear to be documents PSTL produced to JMC in response to JMC\u2019s request for\nproduction. D.I. 98-G at A113 (PSTL\u2019s response to a request for production\nstating that \u201cPlaintiff is contemporaneously producing the following agreements:\n(1) Amended and Restated Mauritius Receivables Securitisation Agreement, (2)\nThird Amended and Restated Servicing Agreement, and (3) Fourth Amended and\nRestated Servicing Agreement\u201d). Tellingly, JMC does not argue that these\ndocuments are different than the ones PSTL produced in discovery but only that\nPSTL should have had someone else attest to the documents\u2019 authenticity. D.I.\n140 at 4. I find that there is a prima facie showing of authenticity based on the\ncontents of the documents and the circumstances of their production. See Fed. R.\nEvid. 901(b)(4) (\u201c[A]ppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other\ndistinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the circumstances\u201d\ncan establish authenticity.); see also McQueeney v. Wilmington Tr. Co., 779 F.2d\n\n916, 929 (3d Cir. 1985) (\u201c[T]he fact that the copies [of the records] were produced\nby the plaintiff in answer to an explicit discovery request for his Sea Service\nRecords, while not dispositive on the issue of authentication, is surely probative.\u201d).\nI thus consider these documents when adjudicating the present motions to dismiss.\n\nB. Standing\n\nArticle III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to\n\u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559 (1992).\nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of this case-or-controversy\nrequirement. /d. at 560. \u201cOnly a party with standing can invoke the jurisdiction of\nthe federal courts.\u201d Constitution Party of Pa. v. Aichele, 757 F.3d 347, 357 (3d\nCir. 2014). To have standing, \u201c[t]he plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in\nfact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3)\nthat is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v.\nRobins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016). The personal injury must be \u201can invasion of a\nlegally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nJMC argues that PSTL has not suffered injury in fact because it assigned its\ninterest in its receivables to Flex Jersey. D.I. 97 at 8. But the agreement between\nFlex Jersey and PSTL is not as simple as JMC suggests because PSTL is Flex\n\nJersey\u2019s local servicer. See D.I. 98-A at A003 \u00a7 3 (identifying PSTL as the local\nservicer of certain receivables); D.I. 123-1 at B009 \u00a7 1.2 (\u201c\u2018Local Servicer\u2019 means\neach Originator... .\u201d); D.I. 123-1 at BO11 \u00a7 2.21 (\u201c[E]ach of the Originators\nagrees to act[] as a Local Servicer....\u201d). As the local servicer, PSTL is obligated\nto pursue collection of its original receivables. See D.I. 98-A at A004 4 D\n(providing that local servicer \u201cwill procure . . . the collection of all Collections in\nrespect of the Receivables\u201d); D.I. 123-1 at BO12 \u00a7 3.1.1 (\u201c[T]he Servicers shall\ncarry out all servicing and collection functions in relation to the\n\nReceivables ....\u201d); D.I. 123-1 at BO12 \u00a7 3.1.3 (\u201c[E]ach Local Servicer shall have\nfull power and authority to do any and all things in connection with such servicing\nand collection functions ....\u201d); D.I. 123-1 at BO14 \u00a7 3.3.1(p) (Local Servicer\nfunctions include \u201cendeavouring, at its own expense[,] to recover amounts due\nfrom faulting Obligors in respect of Receivables... .\u201d).\n\nThe Seventh Circuit has held that a \u201cservicer is much like an assignee for\ncollection, who must render to the assignor the money collected by the assignee\u2019s\nsuit on his behalf (minus the assignee\u2019s fee) but can sue in his own name.\u201d\nCWCapital Asset Mgmt., LLC v. Chicago Properties, LLC, 610 F.3d 497, 500 (7th\nCir. 2010). CWCapital explained that \u201c[t]here is no doubt about Article III\nstanding in this case; though the plaintiff may not be an assignee, it has a personal\nstake in the outcome of the lawsuit because it receives a percentage of the proceeds\n\nof a defaulted loan that it services.\u201d Jd. at 501; see also Greer v. O\u2019Deil, 305 F.3d\n1297, 1303 (11th Cir. 2002) (finding that a loan servicer has standing to conduct\nthe legal affairs of the investor relating to the debt that it services because servicer\nwas obligated \u201cto collect payments[] and to perform administrative services with\nrespect to the claim\u201d and because servicer\u2019s economic interest was directly affected\nas it was \u201centitled to a fee with respect to amounts it collected\u201d).\n\nAs in CWCapital, the delegation of authority to PSTL in connection with its\nservicing agreement is comprehensive, see D.I. 123-1 at BO12 \u00a7 3.1.3, and PSTL\nhas a financial interest in collecting the receivable, see D.I. 123-1 at B020 \u00a7 4.1\n(\u201c[E]ach Local Servicer will be entitled to a servicing fee... .\u201d); see also D.I. 123-\n1 at BO21 \u00a7 4.3 (\u201cAny Collections received . . . which are not required to be\nutilized .. . shall constitute an additional servicing fee payable .. . to the\nOriginators, as Local Servicers ....\u201d). Therefore, following CWCapital and\nGreer, | decline to find that PSTL does not have standing to sue as a result of its\nassignment of interests to Flex Jersey.t\n\nJMC argues that PSTL\u2019s documents show that the receivables are due to\n\nFlex Jersey, but this argument does not change the standing calculus. The\n\nJMC cites Lerman v. Joyce International, Inc., 10 F.3d 106 (3d Cir. 1993) for the\nproposition that \u201cassignments extinguish assignor\u2019s right to assert legal claims.\u201d\nD.I. 97 at 8. But Lerman is inapplicable here. Lerman dealt with the issue of\nwhether the right to assert a RICO claim had been expressly assigned. 10 F.3d at\n112-13. The case does not address assigning rights to receivables in light of a\nservicing agreement as is the issue here.\nagreement provides that the Local Servicer will remit any receivables it collects to\nowner of the receivable interest. D.I. 123-1 at BO37 \u00a7 6.1.11. If PSTL collects any\nreceivables as a result of this lawsuit, it may have to remit the collection to Flex\nJersey, but it still has standing to sue. JMC also argues that this case is different\nfrom the cases cited by PSTL because PSTL is not trying to collect from Unipower\nbut rather from JMC. D.I. 140 at 6. But JMC does not explain why the analysis to\ndetermine whether a servicer has standing is altered when the servicer is trying to\ncollect from a guarantor. Thus, neither argument changes my determination to\ndeny JMC\u2019s summary judgment motion regarding standing.\n\nC. Breach\n\nJMC argues that it has not breached \u201cits obligation to PSTL to pay\n\u2018Guaranteed Obligations\u2019 because any amounts \u2018due and payable by Unipower\u2019 are\nowed to Flex Jersey\u2014not to PSTL.\u201d D.I. 94 at 10. JMC explains that \u201cthe\nGuaranty at issue here does not guarantee amounts due and payable to PSTL\u2019s\n\n\u2018successors and assigns.\u201d D.I. 142 at 11. But JMC\u2019s contract interpretation would\nrequire reading additional provisions into the contract. The guaranty agreement\nrequires that JMC \u201cpay the amount due on the Guaranteed Obligations to PSTL.\u201d\nD.I. 95-C at A067 \u00a7 1.4. A Guaranteed Obligation is \u201cany amount... due and\npayable by Unipower... to PSTL....\u201d D.I. 95-C at A067 \u00a7 1.2. Even after\n\nPSTL\u2019s assignment to Flex Jersey, PSTL, as the servicer, is obligated to collect its\nreceivables. See DL. 121-1 at BO14 \u00a7 3.3.1(p). PSTL then must remit any\ncollection on the receivables. See DI. 121-1 at B037 \u00a7 6.1.11. The guaranty\nagreement does not prohibit PSTL from collecting as a servicer for Flex Jersey nor\ndoes it require that PSTL collect the receivable with no intention of remitting the\npayment. Thus, PSTL\u2019s assignment to Flex Jersey does nothing to extinguish\nJMC\u2019s obligations under the guaranty agreement. I decline to read additional\nterms into the contract. See Eagle Indus., Inc. v. DeVilbiss Health Care, Inc., 702\nA.2d 1228, 1232 (Del. 1997) (\u201cContract terms themselves will be controlling when\nthey establish the parties\u2019 common meaning so that a reasonable person in the\nposition of either party would have no expectations inconsistent with the contract\nlanguage.\u201d).\n\nFinally, JMC\u2019s concerns that it might be liable again to Flex Jersey after\npaying PSTL, D.I. 94 at 9, are unfounded. Flex Jersey has delegated collection\nobligations to PSTL, and PSTL must remit any collections. See D.I. 121-1 at BO12\n\u00a7 3.1.3, BO37 \u00a7 6.1.11. Thus, I decline to make a finding that, as a matter of law,\nJMC did not breach the contract.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nNOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington this Twenty-seventh day of December\n\nin 2021, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that JMC\u2019s First Motion for Summary\n\n10\nJudgment (No Breach) (D.I. 92) and JMC\u2019s Second Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment (Lack of Standing) (D.I. 96) are DENIED.\n\nUnited States _ Judge\n\n11\n"}
