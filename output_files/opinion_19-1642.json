INTRODUCTION  \n This matter is before the Cour t on the report and recommendation regarding claim \nconstruction issued by Magistrate Judge Christopher J. Burke.   D.I. 230 .  Defendant \nBeckman Coulter, Inc. ( \u201cBCI\u201d), has filed objections to the report and recommendation, D.I. \n257, and Plaintiffs Sysmex Corporation and Sysmex America, Inc. (jointly, \u201cSysmex\u201d) \nhave responded to the objections, D.I. 284 .  The Court adopts the magistrate judge\u2019s \nrecommendations in full.  \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA district court  may modify or set aside any part of a magistrate judge\u2019s order that \nis \u201cclearly erroneous or contrary to law.\u201d   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) .  \nThe district court \u201cshall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or \nspecified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made\u201d and \u201cmay \naccept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by \nthe magistrate judge .\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C) .  Similarly, Rule 72 requires de novo 2 \n review of any recommendation that is dispositive of a claim or defense of a party .  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 72(b)(3) . \nThe Supreme Court has construed the statutory grant of authority conferred on \nmagistrate judges under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636  to mean that nondispositive pretrial matters are \ngoverned by \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A) and dispositive matters are covered by \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B).  \nGomez v. United States , 490 U.S. 858, 873 \u201374 (1989) ; see also  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) .  \nUnder subparagraph ( b)(1)(B) , a district court may refer a dispositive motion to a \nmagistrate judge \u201cto conduct hearings, including evidentiary hearings, and to submit  to a \njudge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition.\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) ; see EEOC v. City of Long Branch , 866 F.3d 93, 99 \u2013100 (3d Cir. \n2017) .  The product of a magistrate judge, following a referral of a dispositive matter, is \noften called a \u201creport and recommendation\u201d  (\u201cR&R\u201d).   See Long Branch , 866 F.3d at 99 \u2013\n100.  \u201cParties \u2018may serve and file specific written objections to the proposed findings and \nrecommendations\u2019 within 14 days of being served with a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s \nreport and recommendation.\u201d   Id. at 99  (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2) ). \n\u201cIf a party objects timely to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the \ndistrict court must \u2018make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or \nspecified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\u2019\u201d   Id. \n(quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) ). \nObjections to  claim -construction determinations in an R&R are reviewed de novo.   \nSee St. Clair Intellectual Prop. Consultants, Inc. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. , 691 F. \nSupp. 2d 538, 542 (D. Del. 2010) ; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3) .  Claim \nconstruction falls \u201cexclusively within the province of the court,\u201d not  that of the jury.   Teva 3 \n Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. , 135 S. Ct. 831, 837 (2015)  (quoting  Markman v. \nWestview Instruments, Inc. , 517 U.S. 370, 37 2 (1996) ).  It is proper for courts to \u201ctreat the \nultimate question of the proper construction of the patent as a question of law in the way \nthat [courts] treat document construction as a question of law.\u201d   Id. at 837  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nSysmex is the assignee of the asserted patents, the \u2019350 and  \u2019351 patents.1   D.I. \n1 at 2 .  The asserted patents describe  \u201csample analyzers having a plurality of detectors \nfor sensing blood samples or body -fluid samples, including at least one multi -mode \ndetector that can operate in both the blood measuring mode and the body  fluid measuring \nmode. \u201d  D.I. 1 at 3 .  The parties set out eight disputed claim terms for the Court\u2019s review.  \nFollowing briefing, D.I. 133 , and a Markman  hearing, D.I. 146 , the magistrate judge issued \nhis R&R construing the disputed claim terms, D.I. 230 .  BCI objects to two of Judge \nBurke\u2019s recommended constructions, \u201ccontroller programmed to\u201d and \u201ca blood measuring \nmode / a body fluid measuring mode.\u201d   D.I. 257 .  The Court has reviewed the parties\u2019 \nclaim -construction filings, D.I. 96 ; D.I. 133 , the transcript of the Markman  hearing, D.I. \n146, Jud ge Burke\u2019s claim -construction R&R, D.I. 230 , BCI\u2019s objection to the R&R, D.I. \n257, and certification, D.I. 266 , as well as Sysmex\u2019s response to the objection , D.I. 284 . \nA. Principles of Claim Construction  \nThe claims of a patent define the scope of the patent.  Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 \nF.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005)  (en banc).  The claims of a patent are of primary \nimportance in determining what is patentable and the function and purpose of a claim is \nto \u201cdelimit the right to exclude.\u201d   Id.  The purpose o f claim construction is to \u201cdetermin[e] \n \n1 The parties agree the asserted patents share the same specification and thus the magistrate judge cited \nprimarily to the \u2019350 patent in his claim -construction order . D.I. 133 at 2 ; D.I. 230 at 2 . 4 \n the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed.\u201d   Markman v. \nWestview Instruments, Inc. , 52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed. Cir. 1995)  (en banc), aff\u2019d, 517 U.S. \n370 (1996) .  A claim construction order will dictate how the court will instruct the jury \nregarding a claim\u2019s scope.   O2 Micro Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech . Co., Ltd. , 521 \nF.3d 1351, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2008) . \nThe process of construing a claim term begins with the words of the claims.  \nPhillips , 415 F.3d at 1312 \u201314; Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 \n(Fed. Cir. 1996) .  \u201c[A]bsent contravening evidence from the specific ation or prosecution \nhistory, plain and unambiguous claim language controls the construction analysis. \u201d  DSW, \nInc. v. Shoe Pavilion, Inc. , 537 F.3d 1342, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2008)  (citing N. Telecom Ltd. \nv. Samsung Elecs. Co. , 215 F.3d 1281, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ).  However, the claims \n\u201cmust be read in view of the specification, of which the y are a part.\u201d   Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1315  (quoting Markman , 52 F.3d at 979 ); see Tempo Lighting, Inc. v. Tivoli, LLC , 742 \nF.3d 973, 977 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (stating in claim construction, the court \u201cgives primacy to \nthe language of the claims, followed by the specification\u201d).   Additionally, the prosecution \nhistory, while not literally within the patent document, serves as intrinsic evidence for \npurposes of claim construction.   See Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317 . \nIf a claim term remains ambiguous after an examination of intrinsic evidence, the \ncourt may resort to extrinsic evidence.  Interactive Gift Express, Inc. v. Compuserve, Inc. , \n256 F.3d 1323, 133 2 (Fed. Cir. 2001) .  Extrinsic evidence includes expert and inventor \ntestimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.   Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317 \u201318.  Extrinsic \nevidence is less reliable and less persuasive than intrinsic evidence since such evidence \nis not part of the patent and was not created concurrently with the prosecution of the 5 \n patent.   Id. at 1317 \u201319; Summit 6, LLC v. Samsung Elecs . Co., 802 F.3d 1283, 1290 \n(Fed. Cir. 2015)  (\u201cAlthough courts are permitted to consider extrinsic evidence, like expert \ntestimony, dictionaries, and treatises, such evidence is generally of less significance than \nthe intrinsic record.\u201d).   \u201cExtrinsi c evidence may not be used \u2018to contradict claim meaning \nthat is unambiguous in light of the intrinsic evidence.\u2019\u201d   Summi t 6, LLC , 802 F.3d at 1290  \n(quoting Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1324 ). \n\u201c[A] district court is not obligated to construe terms with ordinary meanings, lest \ntrial courts be inundated with requests to parse the meaning of every word in the asserted \nclaims.\u201d  O2 Micro Int\u2019l Ltd. , 521 F.3d at 1360 .  However, when the parties raise an actual \ndispute regarding the proper scope of these claims, the court, not the jury, must resolve \nthat dispute.  See id. \nThe words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning, \nwhich is the meaning a term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question \nat the time o f the invention.   Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1313 .  The inquiry into how a person of \nordinary skill in the art understands  a term provides an objective baseline for which to \nbegin claim interpretation.  Id.  \u201cIn some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language . \n. . may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases \ninvolves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly \nunderstood words.\u201d  Id. at 1314 . \nB. The Claim Terms  \n1. Claim Terms to which the Parties Did Not Object  \nThe parties did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s construction of six of the eight \nclaim terms  as follows:  6 \n 1) \u201cSeparately displaying\u201d / \u201cseparately display.\u201d   The magistrate judge \nadopted  Sysmex\u2019s proposed construction and construed these terms to mean \u201care  \neach  individually displayed.\u201d   D.I. 230 at 16 \u201319.  He rejected BCI\u2019s proposed \nconstruction of plain and ordinary meaning because the  intrinsic evidence \n(including the claim language and figures) as well as extrinsic dictionary evidence \ndemonstrated the drafters meant \u201cseparately\u201d to mean  \u201cindividually.\u201d  D.I. 230 at \n19.  \n2) \u201cDisplay on an input screen (1) at least two sample -type options that \ncomprise concurrent display  of a blood sample option and a body fluid sample \noption each [independently selectable / selectable independently] from the other \non the input screen.\u201d   The magistrate judge concluded that, based on the briefing, \nthere was no real dispute as to this term and thus concluded it should be afforded \nits plain and ordinary meaning.   D.I. 230 at 21 \u201322. \n3) \u201cA second test result screen.\u201d   The magistrate judge  adopted Sysmex\u2019s \nproposed construction a nd construed this term to mean \u201ca body fluid measuring \nmode test result screen not used in the blood measuring mode.\u201d   D.I. 230 at 25 .  It \nrejected BCI\u2019s contention that the second test results screen was not \u201cmutually \nexclusive of other screens\u201d and could therefore possibly include a blood measuring \nmode because the plain language of the claims indicated the two-test results \nscreen were n ot the same and the second test result screen is specific to the body \nfluid measuring mode.   D.I. 230 at 23 \u201324. \n4) \u201cElectrical detector\u201d and \u201coptical detector.\u201d   Sysmex proposed these terms  \nbe afforded their plain and ordinary meaning while BCI proposed that \u201celectrical 7 \n detector\u201d be construed to mean a \u201cdetector that measures electrical properties of \nblood and body fluid, rather than optical properties\u201d while \u201coptical detector\u201d be \nconstrued to mean a \u201cdetector that measures optical properties of blood and body \nfluid, rather than electrical properties.\u201d  D.I. 230 at 25 \u201326.  The Court agreed with \nBCI because the claim require s a \u201cplurality of detectors\u201d that comprise \u201cat least one \noptical detector\u201d and \u201cat least one electrical detector,\u201d thereby  indicating  the two \ndetectors are different detectors rather than the same detector.   D.I. 230 at 26 .  \nThus, the magistrate judge recommended  that \u201celectrical detector\u201d be construed \nto mean \u201cdetect or that measures electrical properties, rather than optical \nproperties\u201d and the term  \u201coptical detector\u201d be construed to mean \u201cdetector that \nmeasures optical properties, rather than electrical properties.\u201d  D.I. 230 at 27 \u201328. \n5) \u201cMono -nucleated cells\u201d and \u201cpoly -nucleated cells.\u201d  Sysmex proposed no \nconstruction was needed for these terms, or, alternat ively, \u201ccells with a single \nnucleus\u201d and \u201ccells with two or more nuclei,\u201d respectively.  D.I. 230 at 28 .  In \ncontrast, BCI conten ded that mono -nucleated cells should be limited to \n\u201clymphocytes  and monocytes\u201d while poly -nucleated cells should be limited to \n\u201cneutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils ,\u201d all specific types of white blood cells.   \nD.I. 230 at 28 .  Because the claims t hemselves did not limit these types of cells in \nthe way BCI proposed, the magistrate judge recommended that \u201cmono -nucleated \ncells\u201d be construed to mean \u201ccells with a single nucleus\u201d and \u201cpoly -nucleated cells\u201d \nbe construed to mean \u201ccells with two or more nu clei.\u201d   D.I. 230 at 33 . \n6) \u201cTotal [count] of nucleated cells.\u201d   Because the parties\u2019 dispute over this \nclaim term mirrored their dispute over the terms \u201cmono \u201d and \u201cpoly\u201d nucleated cells, 8 \n the magistrate judge again concluded that the total cell count was not limited to the \nfive types of white blood cells BCI proposed an d thus recommended this term be \nconstrued to mean \u201ctotal [count] of cells having one or more nucleus.\u201d  D.I. 230 at \n33\u201335. \nHaving reviewed the record , the Court agrees the magistrate judge correctly \nconstrued these six unobjected -to claim term s. \n2. Claim Terms to Which BCI Objects  \nBCI objects to the magistrate judge\u2019s construction  of the two remaining  claim \nterms: \u201ccontroller programmed to\u201d and \u201ca blood measuring mode / a body fluid measuring \nmode.\u201d   \nThe first disputed term , \u201ccontroller programmed to ,\u201d appears in every independent \nclaim of the asserted patents.  See D.I. 20 at 5 .  As to the term \u201ccontroller programed to,\u201d \nSysmex proposed no construction was necessary and the term should be given its plain \nand ordinary meaning.   D.I. 230 at 6 .  BCI contended that this was a means -plus-function \nterm within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(f)  which provides, \u201cAn element in a c laim for \na combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function \nwithout the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof .\u201d  The magistrate judge \nrecommended adopting Sysmex\u2019s proposal and finding no construction was needed for \nthis term.   Id. at 13 .  BCI objects to th e magistrate judge\u2019s recommended construction, \narguing the magistrate judge ignored its argument that this term goes beyond what a \nperson of ordinary skill in the art would understand a \u201ccontroller\u201d to mean, that Sysmex \nhas changed its definition of \u201ccontroller\u201d via its final infringement contentions,  and that the 9 \n magistrate judge ignored BCI\u2019s expert witness\u2019s testimony  and misread the applicable \ncase law.  D.I. 257 .  \nThe standard by which a court determines \u201cwhether \u00a7 112, para. 6 applies \u2018is \nwhether the words of the claim are understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art to \nhave a sufficiently definite meaning as the name for structure.\u2019\u201d  Diebold Nixdorf, Inc. v. \nInt\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n , 899 F.3d 1291, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2018)  (quoting Williamson v. Citrix \nOnline, LLC , 792 F.3d 1339, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2015) ).  If the claim term does not use the \nword \u201cmeans,\u201d there is a rebuttable presumption that the provision does not apply and the \nparty claiming it is a means -plus-function term must demonstrate by a preponderance of \nthe evidence that the claim \u201cfails to recite sufficiently definite structure\u201d or \u201crecites a \nfunction without reciting sufficient structu re for performing that function.\u201d  Id. at 1298 . \nThe Court agrees with the magistrate judge that BCI did not meet its burden  to \nshow that \u201ccontroller programmed to\u201d should be construed as a means -plus-function term.  \nIn particular, the magistrate judge correctly pointed to case law demonstrating that \n\u201ccontroller\u201d describes  a known class of structures  and is not merely  a nonce term \ndescribing only functions.  D.I. 230 at 6 \u201311.  In its objection, BCI reiterates its same \narguments and claims that Sysmex\u2019s final infringement contentions changed the way \nSysmex proposed to construe this term .  D.I. 257 at 4 \u201310.  The magistrate judge \nthoroughly addressed all of BCI\u2019s  arguments in his R&R, and Sysmex\u2019s infringement \ncontentions do not raise no vel arguments nor are they properly considered for purposes \nof claim construction.   See Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. Hillerich & Bradsby Co. , 442 \nF.3d 1322, 1330 \u201331 (Fed. Cir. 2006)  (\u201c[C]laims may not be c onstrued with reference to \nthe accused device.\u201d (quoting NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc. , 287 F.3d 10 \n 1062, 10 74 (Fed. Cir. 2002) )).  The Court therefore adopts the magistrate judge\u2019s \nrecommendation that the term \u201ccontroller programmed to\u201d is not a means -plus-function \nterm and that no construction is needed for this term.   D.I. 230 at 13 .  \nFinally, as to the terms \u201ca blood measuring mode\u201d and \u201ca body fluid measuring \nmode,\u201d the parties dispute whether the two modes must be defined to exclude one \nanother.   D.I. 230 at 13 .  The magistrate judge agreed with Sysmex that, in light of the \nclaim language and intrinsic record, \u201ca blood measuring mode\u201d should be construed to \nmean \u201ca sample analyzer operation mode, different from the body fluid measuring mode, \nused for measuring cells in a blood sample\u201d and \u201ca body fluid measuring mode\u201d should \nbe construed to mean \u201ca sample analyzer operation mode, different from the blood \nmeasuring mode, used for mea suring cells in a body fluid sample.\u201d  Id. at 16 ; see also \nBecton, Dickinson & Co. v. Tyco Healthcare Grp., LP , 616 F.3d 1249, 1254 (Fed. Cir. \n2010)  (\u201cWhere a claim lists elements separately, \u2018the clear implication of the claim \nlanguage\u2019 is that those elements are \u2018distinct component[s]\u2019 of the patented invention.\u201d \n(quoting Gaus v. Conair Corp. , 363 F.3d 1284, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2004) )). \nBCI objects to this construction, arguing it is inadequate because it does not define \nwhat \u201cmode\u201d means.  D.I. 257 at 11 .  This is a novel argument that BCI did not raise in \nprevious briefing or at the Markman  hearing.  Furthermore, in light of the evidence and \nreasoning cited by the magistrate judge, the Court finds  his recommended construction \nof these terms is correct.  \n \n \n 11 \n IV. CONCLUSION   \nAfter carefully reviewing the report and recommendation on claim construction de \nnovo, the Court finds the magistrate judge is correct in all respects and adopts his report \nand recommendation in claim construction, D.I. 230 , in its enti rety.   \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED:  \n1. Defendant Beckman Coulter Inc.\u2019 s objections, D.I. 257 , are overruled, and  \n2. The Court adopts magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation on claim \nconstruction, D.I. 230 , in its entirety.  \n \nDated this 27th day of April, 2022. \nBY THE COURT:  \n \ns/ Joseph F.
