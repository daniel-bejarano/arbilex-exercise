{"case_name": "Sonrai Memory Ltd. v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP et al", "case_number": "22-1498", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "03-31-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSONRAI MEMORY LTD., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nHEWLETT PACKARD \nENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT \nLP and HEWLETT PACKARD \nENTERPRISE COlVIPANY, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 22-1498-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nThe parties in this case have ignored the rules and standards that govern the \nsealing of documents. Plaintiff, for example, filed under seal on February 10, 2023 \na brief in opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss. D.I 34. Although it is now \nnearly April, Plaintiff has yet to file a redacted version of its brief. See D. Del. R. \n5.l{a) (\"Unless specifically exempted by Court order or rule, all documents \nsubmitted for filing with the Court shall be filed in accordance with the Court's \nAdministrative Procedures Governing Filing and Service by Electronic \nMeans .... \"); Court's Administrative Procedures Governing Filing and Service by \nElectronic Means (G)(l) (requiring parties to file \"[a] redacted version ... within 7 \ndays after the filing of the original sealed document\"). Equally troubling is the type of information the parties and their counsel have said needs to be kept from \nthe public. The parties, for example, agreed to redact this clause from their \nbriefing: \"In the [ contract that Plaintiff alleges Defendants breached], the parties \nagreed that Delaware law governs (PSA \u00a7 8.2) .... \" Compare D.I. 25 at 6, with \nD.I. 30 at 6. I can think of no reason that would justify keeping this information \nfrom the public eye. I cannot resolve the parties' contract dispute without first \ndeciding what law governs the resolution of the dispute. How can a federal court \ndecide a case without letting the public know what law it applied and why it \napplied that law? \nAs I have said before: \"The District Court is not a star chamber. We are a \npublic institution in a democratic republic and the public has a right of access to \nour filings and proceedings. That right is founded in the common law and \nantedates the Constitution. The public's right of access is not absolute; but it is \nstrongly presumed, and it can be overcome only if a party demonstrates that public \ndisclosure of a filing will result in a clearly defined and serious injury.\" WSOU \nlnvs., LLC v. Salesforce, Inc., 2023 WL 2213200, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 24, 2023) \n( citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nI signed the parties' unopposed motions to seal their filings based on \nrepresentations in the motions from the parties' counsel that good cause existed to \njustify sealing. I have now reviewed the parties' filings. There is no information \n2 in the filings that could cause either party any adverse consequence let alone a \nclearly defined or serious injury if made public. Accordingly, I will unseal the \nfilings and, in the future, will review with much more scrutiny if not skepticism the \nrepresentations of these parties and counsel. \nNow therefore, at Wilmington on this Thi1ty-first day of March in 2023, it is \nHEREBY ORDERED that the Clerk of the Court is directed to unseal D.I. 1, D.I. \n16, D.I. 25, and D.I. 34. \nat.. ;J a.. ~) \nEF JUDGE \n3 "}
