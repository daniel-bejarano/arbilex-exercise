FRANCIS HOSPITAL, \nDefendant. \nErin M. Bickley, Wilmington, Delaware. Pro se Plaintiff. \nColleen D. Shields, Esq., and Jessica L. Reno, Esq., Eckert Seamans Cherin & \nMellot LLC, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendant. \nMarch 3, 2023 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Erin M. Bickley, proceeding prose, filed this action on January 30, \n2023, naming as the sole Defendant St. Francis Hospital. (D.I. 1) On February 1, \n2023, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint. (D.I. 7) Plaintiff has also filed \nmotions to waive the filing fee (which Plaintiff already paid) (D.I. 3), to compel \nemergency injunctive action (D.I. 4), fore-filing rights (D.I. 5), and to add a \ndefendant (D.I. 8). Before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. (D.1. 11) Defendant \nhas also filed a motion to expedite. (D.I. 12) \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND' \nOn January 24, 2023, Plaintiff's wife (\"the decedent\") , was found \nunresponsive in her hospital bed in Defendant's intensive care unit. (D.I. 7 at 4) \nThe decedent was resuscitated and placed on life support, but she passed away on \nJanuary 27, 2023. (Id. at 4-5) Her cause of death is unknown, and Defendant has \nrefused Plaintiff' s request to recommend that the state medical examiner perform \nan autopsy. Plaintiff seeks by the Amended Complaint an order\"[ c ]ompel[ling] \nSt. Francis Hospital to recommend to the Medical Examiner to conduct an autopsy \n1 Plaintiff's allegations are accepted as true for purposes of deciding this motion. \nSee 2 James W. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7 12.30[ 4] (3d ed. 1997) (\"In \nreviewing a facial attack [to subject-matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. \nl 2(b )(1 )], a trial court accepts the allegations in the complaint as true.\"). \n1 based upon the unknown cause of death.\" (Id. at 7) Plaintiff asserts that this \nCourt has federal question jurisdiction based on a theory of due process resulting \nfrom the state of Delaware's \"lack[] [ of] emergency injunctive relief for medical \nmalpractice.\" (Id at 3) Plaintiff also asserts that \"[t]he Delaware Superior, \nFamily, and Chancery Courts do not have a special process for medical malpractice \nemergency injunctive relief.\" (Id. at 5) Plaintiff has moved to add the Attorney \nGeneral of Delaware as a defendant. (D.1. 8) \nIn the motion to expedite, Defendant asserts that the decedent was in the \nintensive care unit for three months until her death, and that her \"body remains \nunclaimed and decompensating in the St. Francis morgue for [more than 30] days.\" \n(D.1. 12 at 1) Given the exigency of the situation and the manifest lack of federal \njurisdiction, the Court will grant Defendant's motion to expedite and address \nDefendant's motion to dismiss even though Plaintiff has not had an opportunity to \nrespond. \nII. DISCUSSION \nThis is assuredly a difficult and tragic time for Plaintiff. But the remedy \nPlaintiff seeks is not available in this forum. \"Federal courts are courts of limited \njurisdiction. . . . It is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited \njurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party \nasserting jurisdiction.\" Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, \n2 3 77 ( 1994) ( citations omitted). In this case, Plaintiff cannot meet that burden. \nOur Constitution does not confer on federal courts jurisdiction over the \npurely local issue of whether, when, and how a state must conduct an autopsy for \nthe purpose of determining if attendant criminal or civil relief ought to be pursued \nin the courts of that state. Plaintiff's invocation of the phrase \"due process\" does \nnot alter that reality. See, e.g., Warrington Sewer Co. v. Tracy, 463 F .2d 771, 772 \n(3d Cir. 1972) (\"A bare allegation of violation of the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment is not sufficient to confer federal jurisdiction.\"); see also \nDaggett v. Key, 123 Fed. App'x 721, 723 (7th Cir. 2005) (affirming dismissal for \nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction where plaintiff did \"nothing more than apply the \nwords 'due process' and 'conspiracy' to what are plainly state claims\"); Avitts v. \nAmoco Prod Co., 53 F.3d 690, 694 (5th Cir. 1995) (\"[S]ubject matter jurisdiction \ncannot be created by simple reference to federal law. Subject matter jurisdiction \ncan only be created by pleading a cause of action within the district court's original \njurisdiction.\"); McGee v. Town of Rockland Zoning Bd., 863 F. Supp. 2d 108, 110 \n(D. Mass. 2012) (remanding case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and noting \nthat the \"incantation of the catch-all concept of' due process' does not magically \ntransform [ a local dispute about a license] into a matter of federal law warranting \nreview by a federal court\"). This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this \npurely local matter and amendment is futile. \n3 III. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will grant Defendant's motion to dismiss, \npursuant to Fed. R. 12(b){l), and dismiss this matter without prejudice. All of \nPlaintiffs' pending motions will be denied. 2 \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n2 To the extent that Plaintiffs motion for fee waiver was a request for a refund of \nthe filing fee, such relief is not available. See Porter v. Dep 't of the Treasury, 564 \nF.3d 176, 179 (3d Cir. 2009) (appellants are not entitled to return of their filing and \ndocketing fees, regardless of whether an appeal is voluntarily dismissed); Goins v. \nDecarao, 241 F.3d 260,261 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"[A] refund claim ... encounters the \nbarrier of sovereign immunity, since the ... funds have become the property of the \nUnited States\"); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 ( e) {\"The clerk of each district court shall \npay in the Treasury all fees, costs and other moneys collected by him[.]\"). \n4 IN THE UN1TED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nERIN M. BICKLEY, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civil Action No. 23-111-CFC \nST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL , \nDefendant. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this Third day of March in 2023 for the reasons set forth in \nthe Memorandum Opinion issued this date, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Defendant's motion to expedite (D.I. 12) and motion to dismiss (D.I. \n11) are GRANTED , and the case is DISMISSED without prejudice. \n2. Plaintiff's motion for fee waiver (D.I. 3), Motion to compel \nemergency injunctive action (D.I. 4), motion fore-filing rights (D.I. 5), and Motion \nto add defendant (D.I. 8) are DENIED as moot. \n3. The Clerk of Court is directed to close the case. "}
