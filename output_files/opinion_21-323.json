(D.I. 59, 60 & 61).   Neither side  provided a tutorial describing the relevant \ntechnology.  The Court carefully reviewed all submissions in conne ction with the parties\u2019 3 contentions regarding the disputed claim terms, heard oral argument ( see D.I. 77) and applied the \nfollowing legal standards in reaching its decision.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Claim Construction \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n574 U.S. 318, 325 (2015).  \u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meanin g [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill \nin the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent \napplication.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  Although \u201cthe claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms,\u201d the context of the surrounding words of the claim must also be considered.  Id.  at 1314.  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201cis always highly relevant to the claim construction analys is . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201cthe specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by  the patentee that differs from the meaning it would \notherwise possess.  In such cases, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201cEven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent  will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to \nlimit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d  Hill- Rom 4 Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201cshould also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d  Markman v. West view Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201cintrinsic \nevidence,  . . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and \nTrademark Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\u201d  Phillips , \n415 F.3d at 1317. \u201c[T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language \nby demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.\u201d  Id.  \nIn some cases, courts \u201cwill need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to unders tand, for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\u201d  Teva , 574 U.S. at 331. \nExtrinsic evidence \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert a nd inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d  Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201cto ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art,  or to establish that a \nparticular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201cexpert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at  the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer \nfrom bias that is not present in intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id.   Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201cmay \nbe useful to the court,\u201d it is \u201cless reliable\u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its conside ration \u201cis unlikely 5 to result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the \nintrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id. at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof the patented invention, reliance  on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. \nv. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nB. Indefiniteness  \n\u201cThe primary purpose of the definiteness requirement is to ensure that the clai ms are \nwritten in such a way that they give notice to the public of the extent of the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, e.g., competitors of the patent owner, can \ndetermine whether or not they infringe.\u201d  All Dental Prodx, LLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779- 80 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing Warner -Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., \n520 U.S. 17, 28- 29 (1997)).  Put another way, \u201c[a] patent holder should know what he owns, and \nthe public should know what he does not.\u201d  Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U.S. 722, 731 (2002). \nA patent claim  is indefinite if, \u201cviewed in light of the specific ation and prosecution history, \n[it fails to] inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty.\u201d  Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U.S. 898, 910 (2014).  A claim may be \nindefinite if the patent does not convey with reasonable certainty how to measure a claimed feature.  See Teva Pharm s. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  But \u201c[i]f such \nan understanding of how to measure the claimed [feature] was within the scope of knowle dge \npossessed by one of ordinary skill in the art, there is no requirement for the specification to identify a particular measurement technique.\u201d  Ethicon Endo- Surgery, Inc. v. Covidien, Inc., 796 F.3d \n1312, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2015). 6 Like claim construction, definiteness is a question of law, but the Court must sometimes \nrender factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the ultimate issue of definiteness.  \nSee, e.g., Sonix Tech. Co. v. Publications Int\u2019l, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ; see also \nTeva , 574 U.S. at 334-36.  \u201cAny fact critical to a holding on indefiniteness . . . must be proven by \nthe challenger by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d  Intel Corp. v. VIA Techs., Inc., 319 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Tech.  Licensi ng Corp. v. Videotek, Inc., 545 F.3d 1316, 1338 (Fed. \nCir. 2008). \nII. THE COURT\u2019S RULING  \nThe Court\u2019s ruling regarding the disputed claim terms of the  \u2019567, \u2019550, \u2019488, and \u2019983 \npatent s was announced during the Markman hearing on December 8 , 2022, as follows: \nThank you for the arguments  today.  They were helpful.  At \nissue, there are six disputed terms in four patents,[1] I am prepared \nto rule on all of the disputes. \n \nI will not be issuing a written opinion, but I will issue an \norder stating my rulings.  I want to emphasize , before I announce \nmy decisions , that although I am not issuing a written opinion, we \nhave followed a full and thorough process before making the decisions I am about to state.  I have reviewed the patents in disput e. \nI have also reviewed the ITC papers, the expert declarations, and all of the other materials submitted in the more than 1,500 pages of appendices.  There was full briefing on each of the disputed terms and we had argument here today.  All of that has be en carefully \nconsidered. \n As to my rulings, I am not going to read into the record my \nunderstanding of claim construction law and definiteness.  I have a legal standard section that I have included in earlier opinions, including somewhat recently in CAO Li ghting v. GE , C.A. No. 20-\n681.  I incorporate that law and adopt it into my ruling today and will also set it out in the order that I issue.  \n \n \n1  U.S. Patent Nos. 8,019,567 (\u201cthe \u2019567 patent\u201d), 8,596,550 (\u201cthe \u2019550 patent\u201d), 8,886,488 (\u201cthe \u2019488 patent\u201d), 10,612,983 (\u201cthe \u2019983 patent\u201d). 7 Neither party has suggested any differences in the definition \nof a POSA that are relevant to the claim constructio n issues.  \n \nThe first term is \u201c operational efficiency \u201d in C laims 1 and 15 \nof the \u2019567 patent and C laims 1 and 9 of the \u2019488 patent.  Plaintiff \nproposes \u201cenergy required by the HVAC system to change inside \ntemperature by a given amount over a given time for  a set of indoor \nand outdoor conditions.\u201d  Defendant proposes \u201cenergy or time \nrequired by the HVAC system to change inside temperature by a given amount for a set of indoor and outdoor conditions.\u201d  The crux of the dispute is whether the term is limited to  energy, or if it can \nalternatively be defined as time.  Here, like the ITC and the District Court in Texas, I agree with Defendant.  \n I don\u2019t think that there is anything in the intrinsic evidence \nto justify the limit proposed by Plaintiff.  To the contrar y, the \nspecification states that \u201cmany factors affect the efficiency of HVAC systems,\u201d some of which are fixed and others of which are more dynamic.\n[2]  In further describing these factors, it explains that \nthe \u201csignature\u201d of a particular problem affectin g the efficiency of \nHVAC systems can be identified by how each problem affects the cycle times of a given HVAC system over time , and thus longer \ncycle times may be indicative of a problem and correspond to a value of operational efficiency.\n[3]  The specif ication therefore \nexplains that cycle times, not just energy, can correspond to a value of operational efficiency.  \n I think that Figures 8a and 8b and the text describing them \nin Column 5 of the \u2019488 patent also support my construction as they \ndisclose th at longer cycle times not explained by a higher outdoor \ntemperature indicates a decrease in efficiency.  \n So I think that intrinsic evidence supports that time can be \nan expression of efficiency, at least as long as it is expressed for a given set of indoor  and outdoor conditions.\n[4]  And I will construe \n\u201coperational efficiency\u201d to mean \u201cenergy or time required by the HVAC system to change inside temperature by a given amount for \na set of indoor and outdoor conditions.\u201d  \n \n \n2  (\u2019488 patent, col. 3, ll. 35 -42). \n \n3  (\u2019488 patent, col. 3, ll. 43 -61). \n \n4  (D.I. 58, Ex. 31 \u00b6 42 -45). 8 The second dispute is whether the pr eambles of claims 1 and \n9 of the \u2019488 patent are limiting.  Plaintiff says yes they are and \nDefendant disagrees.  Here I agree with Plaintiff.  \n A preamble is limiting if it provides \u201clife, meaning, and \nvitality\u201d to the claims.\n[5]  There is no litmus test that defines when a \npreamble limits claim scope.[6]  Rather \u201c[w]hether to treat a \npreamble as a limitation is \u2018determined on the facts of each case in light of the overall form of the claim, and the invention as described \nin the specification and illuminated in the prosecution history.\u2019\u201d\n[7]  \n \nIn Claims 1 and 9, the preambles recite \u201ccalculating a value \nfor the operational efficiency.\u201d  The body of the claims following \nthe preambles require receiving and storing temperature \nmeasur ements, making certain calculations and comparisons.  \nNowhere in the body of the claims [,] however [,] is it evident that \nsteps are being performed to figure out the operational efficiency of the system.  Thus, without the preamble a POSA would not \nundersta nd the utility of the system described or the invention \nclaimed.  And I think that calculating the operational efficiency is more than just the intended purpose or use of the system [;] I think it \nis a fundamental characteristic of the claimed system.  Thus , the \npreambles do add life, meaning and vitality to the claims and they are limiting.  \n The third term is \u201cfirst state of repair\u201d in C laims 1 and 15 of \nthe \u2019567 patent.  Plaintiff argues that the term is indefinite because \nit lacks a definition in the patent or relevant art.  Defendant argues \nthat the term is not indefinite and the term should be given its plain \nand ordinary meaning, whi ch is \u201cstate or condition which forms a \nbaseline for comparison.\u201d  \n I note that neither \u201crepair\u201d nor \u201cstate of repair\u201d is used in the \nspecification.  But I don\u2019t think that is dispositive because \u201cstate of repair\u201d is simple language understandable to a POS A as evidenced \n \n5  Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 1999) . \n \n6  Catalina Mktg. Int \u2019l, Inc. v. Coolsavings.com, Inc. , 289 F.3d 801, 808 (Fed. Cir. 2002) . \n \n7  Deere & Co. v. Bush Hog, LLC , 703 F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting Applied \nMaterials, Inc. v. Advanced Semiconductor  Materials America, Inc. , 98 F.3d 1563, 1572-\n73 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  9 by the various definitions from dictionaries and patents related to \nHVAC systems that Defendant cites.[8]  \n And I think that even though the specification doesn\u2019t use \nthe words, it does disclose the concept of a state of repair.  For exampl e, at column 9, the patent talks about being able to diagnose \nproblems and determine whether the operational efficiency of the HVAC system has decreased.\n[9]  It explains how drops in efficiency \ncan be determined by evaluating the cycle time of an HVAC sys tem \non \u201cdate X\u201d that is working at a level of efficiency (such as \u201cnormal\u201d) on that date versus the cycle time on a different date \u201cX+1.\u201d  So I think that this supports that a state of repair is really just the condition of the system. \n Now, as to Defendan t\u2019s proposed language regarding a \nbaseline.\n[10]  I don\u2019t know that I see the support for that.  But I do \n \n8  (D.I. 58 at 46 (citing to Ex. 17 (Merriam -Webster) (defining \u201cgood/bad state of repair\u201d as \n\u201cgood/bad condition \u201d); Ex. 18 (World Law Dictionary) (defining \u201c state of repair\u201d as \u201cthe \nphysical condition  of something, especially of a building\u201d in the context of property law); \nEx. 19 (U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2021/0021972) \u00b6\u00b6 29, 57 (explaining how a subject device 200\u2014including a \u201cheating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HV AC) device\u201d\u2014has \na current \u201cstate of repair\u201d that may be provided in a record \u201cindicating that the subject device 200 has broken down, is working sub- optimally, is giving off a warning or \n\u2018maintenance needed\u2019 signal, or the like\u201d); Ex. 20 (U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2015/0323211) \u00b6 80 (describing data \u201cused to assess the state of repair\u201d of HVAC equipment); Ex. 21 (Air Conditioning Contractors of America Standard) at 34 (in 2013 industry standard for \u201cMaintenance of Residential HVAC Systems,\u201d referring to ins pection \nof \u201cstate of repair\u201d of HVAC equipment filters); Ex. 22 (Sama HVAC) (2018 HVAC \ncompany webpage noting that \u201c[t]o understand the work needed, the technician needs to see the system in situ , and assess the state of repair of the system\u201d); Ex. 23 (Eas t Cooper \nHVAC) (HVAC company webpage explaining: \u201cWhen an air conditioner is not routinely maintained, it will fall into disrepair. This state of repair requires the air conditioner to \nwork harder in order to perform at the demanded level.\u201d); Ex. 24 (Ball HVAC) (HVAC \ncompany webpage explaining that \u201c[w]hen your ducts are in a poor state of repair , you \ncould see your home\u2019s energy efficiency decline sharply, and your heating and air conditioning make up a huge portion of your overall energy costs\u201d) ) (emphases in \noriginal) ). \n \n9  (\u2019567 patent, col. 9, ll. 1- 25). \n \n10  Plaintiff argues that \u201cfirst state of repair\u201d cannot refer to a baseline because that would change the meaning of the claims because nothing in the claim language requires it to be used as a baseline to compare against a second state.  Plaintiff, however, has failed to show \nthat a POSA would not understand \u201cfirst state of repair\u201d in the claims in the context of the specification.   Initially, a \u201cfirst state\u201d is not necessarily required to have subsequent states 10 think that a POSA would understand the \u201cfirst state of repair\u201d refers \nto the condition of the HVAC system when calculating the \u201cestimate[ed] rate of ch ange in inside temperature\u201d or \u201cexpected \ntemperature measurements\u201d in C laims 1 and 15, respectively, that \nare then used in comparison to the inside temperature to determine \nthe operational efficiency of the HVAC system.  So I will construe \nthe term to mean  an initial condition, with the clarification that I do \nnot mean that it is the first or original from the factory condition.  \n \nSo with that I am going to reject the argument that the term \nis indefinite.  Plaintiff has not proven that by clear and convinci ng \nevidence.  I suppose it is possible that other arguments will be made or new evidence will come out that sheds new light on the definiteness issue.  So I won\u2019t preclude Plaintiff from raising it again if appropriate later based on something new. \n The fo urth term is \u201c expected temperature measurements of \na rate of change in inside temperature\u201d in Claim 15 of the \u2019567 Patent.  Plaintiff argues the term is indefinite because there is no \ndiscernable meaning in the patent for what constitutes this expected measurement of a rate of change, nor how it could be calculated. Defendant argues that the term is not indefinite and the term should be given its plain and ordinary meaning, which is \u201cexpected temperature measurements resulting from a rate of change in insid e \ntemperature.\u201d  I find the term not indefinite and will give the term its plain and ordinary meaning, which is \u201cexpected temperature \nmeasurements based on historic measured rates of change in inside temperatures.\u201d  \n As we discussed during the argument, the ITC has addressed \nthis claim term already.  I am not bound by that determination, but in this case, I find that the reasoning set forth is persuasive.  \n So I will adopt that reasoning and the result of it here.  Let  \nme quote:  \n [T]he whole point of the invention is to monitor an HVAC system\u2019s operation over time to determine its operational efficiency. 567 patent, Abstract. The patent teaches that temperatures inside a house and outside a house are measured, and these  \nmeasurements are used to predict what the house temperature should be at similar times of day, \n \nor be the first in a sequence of events .

Cir. 2003). 11 seasons, etc. See, e.g., 567 patent, 9:1- 35; 11:11- 56. \nMoreover, claim 15 recites how the expected \ntemperature measurements are derived, which are \n\u201cbased at least in part upon past temperature measurements and based at least in part on outside temperature measurements.\u201d 567 patent, cl. 15. And the parties already agree that the meaning of \u201crate of change\u201d is \u201cthe difference between inside temperature measurements  divided by the span of \ntime between the measurements.\u201d\n[11] . . . Thus, a \nPOSITA would understand, reading claim 15 and the specification, that \u201cexpected temperature measurements of a rate of change in inside temperature\u201d means exactly that \u2013 the inside \ntemperature that would be expected based on historic \nmeasured rates of change in inside temperatures. \u201d\n[12]  \n And in so ruling, it means that Plaintiff has failed to put forth \nclear and convincing evidence that the term is indefinite for lack of discernible m eaning.  \n The fifth term is \u201c performance characteristic\u201d in C laim 18 of \nthe \u2019983 patent.  Plaintiff argues that the term is indefinite because the claims and specification fail to inform a POSA about the scope of the invention.  Defendant argues that the te rm is definite and \nshould be accorded its plain and ordinary meaning, which means \u201cproperty feature, or attribute of the HVAC system indicating its ability to change temperature.\u201d   \n I am going to construe this term for now according to its \nplain and ordinary meaning, which as I see it is \u201ca characteristic of performance.\u201d  At this point , I am not convinced that EcoFactor\u2019s \nargument that the characteristic must indicate the system\u2019s ability to \nchange the temperature is correct so I am not including tha t.  And \nlike the ITC, I have some questions about the definiteness of this \nterm and think it may be useful to see if anything more comes out after more fulsome discovery.  So I will reject Ecobee\u2019s definiteness \nargument on the current record, but allow it to raise the issue again \nas appropriate.  \n \n \n11  (D.I. 48 at 1) . \n \n12  (D.I. 58, Ex. 8 ( Certain Smart Thermostat Systems, Smart Hvac Systems, Smart Hvac  \nControl Systems, and Components Thereof , Inv.

Plaintiff argues that the term \nis indefinite because there is no reasonably ascertainable antecedent \nbasis for th e term.  Defendant argues that the term is definite and \nshould be accorded its plain and ordinary meaning, which it says is \u201cthe thermostatic controller.\u201d  Here, I agree with Defendant.   \n It is true that independent C laims 1 and 9 only recite a \n\u201cthermosta tic controller\u201d and not the thermostatic control device in \nthe dependent claims that rely on those.  But I think that Defendant is correct that the claim apprises a POSA of the scope even if the words are slightly different, and therefore satisfies the not ice \nfunction.\n[13]  Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019s \u201coverly formalistic attack on this \nclaim language ignores the relatively forgiving standard that the claim language must only reasonably appraise a POSA of its scope.\u201d\n[14]  Here, it is clear that \u201cthermostatic control device\u201d means \n\u201cthermostatic controller,\u201d and a POSA would, with reasonable certainty, be informed of the scope of the invention.  \n Therefore, I will construe \u201csaid thermostatic control device\u201d \nto mean \u201cthe thermostatic controller.\u201d  \n (D.I. 77 at 86:16-95:9 ).  \n  \n              \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika        United States District Judge  \n \n \n13  See In re Downing, 754 F.
