CONCLUSION ............................................................................... 53 \n111 CHIEF JUDGE \nPlaintiffs BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc and Arius Two, Inc. \n( collectively BDSI) have sued Defendants Alvogen PB Research & Development \nLLC, Alvogen Malta Operations Ltd., Alvogen Pine Brook LLC, Alvogen, Inc., \nand Alvogen Group, Inc. ( collectively Alvo gen) under the Drug Price Competition \nand Patent Term Restoration Act-commonly called the Hatch-Waxman Act. \nBDSI alleges that Alvogen's submission to the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for approval to market a \ngeneric version ofBDSI's Belbuca\u00ae drug product constitutes infringement of U.S. \nPatents Nos. 8,147,866 (the #866 patent, JTX-001), 9,655,843 (#843 patent, JTX-\n002), and 9,901,539 (the #539 patent, JTX-003) pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2 71 ( e )( 2 )(A). \nBDSI assert claims 3, 4, 5, and 10 of the #866 patent; claims 8, 9, and 20 of \nthe #843 patent; and claims 9 and 20 of the #539 patent. Alvogen stipulated to \ninfringement of the asserted claims but argues that all asserted claims are invalid. \nAlvogen contends (1) that all of the asserted claims are invalid for obviousness \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 and (2) that claims 3, 4, 5, and 10 of the #866 patent and \nclaims 8 and 20 of the #843 patent are invalid for anticipation under\u00a7 102. I held a three-day bench trial, and, as required by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 5 2( a)( 1 ), I have set forth separately below my findings of fact and \nconclusions of law. \nI. THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nThe ANDA procedures out of which this case arise were established by FDA \nregulations promulgated pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(FDCA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq., and specifically by the so-called Hatch-Waxman \nAmendments to the FDCA. Justice Kagan provided in Caraco Pharmaceutical \nLaboratories, Ltd. v. Novo NordiskAIS, 566 U.S. 399 (2012), this helpful summary \nof the provisions of the Amendments and the FDA regulations that bear on this \ncase: \nThe FDA regulates the manufacture, sale, and labeling of \nprescription drugs under a complex statutory scheme. To \nbegin at the beginning: When a brand manufacturer wishes \nto market a novel drug, it must submit a new drug \napplication (NDA) to the FDA for approval. The NDA \nmust include, among other things, a statement of the \ndrug's components, scientific data showing that the drug \nis safe and effective, and proposed labeling describing the \nuses for which the drug may be marketed. The FDA may \napprove a brand-name drug for multiple methods of use\u00ad\neither to treat different conditions or to treat the same \ncondition in different ways. \nOnce the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer's drug, \nanother company may seek permission to market a generic \nversion pursuant to legislation known as the Hatch\u00ad\nWaxman Amendments. Those amendments allow a \ngeneric competitor to file an abbreviated new drug \n2 application (ANDA) piggy-backing on the brand's NDA. \nRather than providing independent evidence of safety and \nefficacy, the typical ANDA shows that the generic drug \nhas the same active ingredients as, and is biologically \nequivalent to, the brand-name drug. As we have \npreviously recognized, this process is designed to speed \nthe introduction of low-cost generic drugs to market. \nBecause the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that \nwould infringe a patent, the timing of an ANDA's \napproval depends on the scope and duration of the patents \ncovering the brand-name drug. Those patents come in \ndifferent varieties. One type protects the drug compound \nitself. Another kind . . . gives the brand manufacturer \nexclusive rights over a particular method of using the drug. \nIn some circumstances, a brand manufacturer may hold \nsuch a method-of-use patent even after its patent on the \ndrug compound has expired. \nTo facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as \npatents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and FDA \nregulations direct brand manufacturers to file information \nabout their patents. The statute mandates that a brand \nsubmit in its NOA the patent number and the expiration \ndate of any patent which claims the drug for which the \nbrand submitted the NDA or which claims a method of \nusing such drug. And the regulations issued under that \nstatute require that, once an NOA is approved, the brand \nprovide a description of any method-of-use patent it holds. \nThat description is known as a use code, and the brand \nsubmits it on FDA Form 3542. . . . [T]he FDA does not \nattempt to verify the accuracy of the use codes that brand \nmanufacturers supply. It simply publishes the codes, \nalong with the corresponding patent numbers and \nexpiration dates, in a fat, brightly hued volume called the \nOrange Book (less colorfully but more officially \ndenominated Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic \nEquivalence Evaluations). \n3 After consulting the Orange Book, a company filing an \nANDA must assure the FDA that its proposed generic drug \nwill not infringe the brand's patents. When no patents are \nlisted in the Orange Book or all listed patents have expired \n( or will expire prior to the ANDA' s approval), the generic \nmanufacturer simply certifies to that effect. Otherwise, \nthe applicant has two possible ways to obtain approval. \nOne option is to submit a so-called section viii statement, \nwhich asserts that the generic manufacturer will market \nthe drug for one or more methods of use not covered by \nthe brand's patents. A section viii statement is typically \nused when the brand's patent on the drug compound has \nexpired and the brand holds patents on only some \napproved methods of using the drug. If the ANDA \napplicant follows this route, it will propose labeling for the \ngeneric drug that \"carves out\" from the brand's approved \nlabel the still-patented methods of use. The FDA may \napprove such a modified label as an exception to the usual \nrule that a generic drug must bear the same label as the \nbrand-name product. FDA acceptance of the carve-out \nlabel allows the generic company to place its drug on the \nmarket (assuming the ANDA meets other requirements), \nbut only for a subset of approved uses-i. e., those not \ncovered by the brand's patents. \n**** \nThe generic manufacturer's second option is to file a so\u00ad\ncalled paragraph IV certification, which states that a listed \npatent \"is invalid or will not be infringed by the \nmanufacture, use, or sale of the generic drug.\" 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). A generic manufacturer will \ntypically take this path in either of two situations: if it \nwants to market the drug for all uses, rather than carving \nout those still allegedly under patent; or if it discovers, as \ndescribed above, that any carve-out label it is willing to \nadopt cannot avoid the brand's use code. Filing a \nparagraph IV certification means provoking litigation. \nThe patent statute treats such a filing as itself an act of \n4 infringement, which gives the brand an immediate right to \nsue [under] 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A). Assuming the brand \ndoes so, the FDA generally may not approve the ANDA \nuntil 3 0 months pass or the court finds the patent invalid \nor not infringed. Accordingly, the paragraph IV process is \nlikely to keep the generic drug off the market for a lengthy \nperiod, but may eventually enable the generic company to \nmarket its drug for all approved uses. \n566 U.S. at 404-08 (irrelevant citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nII. BACKGROUND \nBelbuca\u00ae is a bioerodable mucoadhesive (BEMA) film for transmucosal \ndelivery of the opioid buprenorphine and is indicated for the treatment of pain. Tr. \n91:13; JTX-233 at 23. Belbuca\u00ae is a dissolvable film placed on the inside of the \npatient's check. As the film dissolves, buprenorphine flows into the mucosa, \nwhere the drug enters the bloodstream and spreads throughout the body. Belbuca\u00ae \nis applied to the patient's buccal surface, i.e., the inside of the cheek. The film has \ntwo layers: (1) a mucoadhesive layer that contains the drug and that adheres to the \nuser's buccal surface and (2) a backing layer that prevents the drug from dissolving \ninto the oral cavity and, thus, from being swallowed. Tr. 593:16-25; JTX-233 at \n23. The backing layer creates a unidirectional gradient so that buprenorphine \nmoves from the mucoadhesive layer into the mucosa, the soft tissue that lines the \ninside of the mouth, where the drug is further absorbed into the bloodstream. Tr. \n139:11-14, 586:24-587:19. \n5 BDSI is the assignee of the asserted patents and lists them in connection \nwith Belbuca\u00ae in the Orange Book. BDSI also lists U.S. Patent No. 7,579,019 \n( the #019 patent) in the Orange Book. The #019 patent expired on January 22, \n2020. Alvogen filed an ANDA seeking FDA approval for a generic version of \nBelbuca\u00ae after expiration of the #019 patent but before expiration of the asserted \npatents. Alvogen' s ANDA contains a paragraph IV certification alleging that the \nasserted patents are invalid. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 G)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). In response to \nthat certification, BDSI brought this litigation. \nThe #866 and #843 patents, both of which are titled \"Transmucosal Delivery \nDevices with Enhanced Uptake,\" were issued on April 3, 2012 and May 23, 201 7 \nrespectively. The #843 is a continuation of the #866 patent and claims the same \npriority date. The parties dispute what priority date the patents are eligible to \nclaim, but the earliest possible priority date is July 21, 2006. D.I. 229, Ex. 1 ,r,r 21, \n28. The patents teach two-layer bioerodable mucoadhesive buprenorphine delivery \ndevices and methods for administering buprenorphine with those same devices. \nThe #539 patent, titled \"Transmucosal Drug Delivery Devices for Use in \nChronic Pain Relief,\" was issued on February 27, 2018 and claims a priority data \nof December 21, 2011. JTX-003. The #539 patent discloses the results of a \nBelbuca\u00ae clinical trial and teaches the treatment of chronic pain using a BEMA \n6 device where the backing layer is buffered to a pH of between about 4.0 and about \n4.8. \nID. LEGALSTANDARDS \nA. Obviousness \nUnder \u00a7 103 of the Patent Act, 1 a patent \"may not be obtained ... if the \ndifferences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are \nsuch that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the \ninvention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said \nsubject matter pertains.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 (2006). As the Supreme Court explained \nin the seminal case Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1966), under\u00a7 103, \n\" [ a ]n invention which has been made, and which is new in the sense that the same \nthing has not been made before, may still not be patentable if the difference \nbetween the new thing and what was known before is not considered sufficiently \ngreat to warrant a patent.\" Id. at 14. Section 103 ensures that \"the results of \nordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive rights under the patent laws.\" \nKSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398,427 (2007). \"Were it otherwise \n1 Congress amended the Patent Act in 2011 when it enacted the Leahy-Smith \nAmerica Invents Act (AIA). See Pub. L. No. 112-29, 125 Stat. 284,296 (2011). \nPre-AIA versions of\u00a7 102 and \u00a7 103 apply to all patents with an effective filing \ndate before March 16, 2013. See\u00a7 3(n) 125 Stat. at 293. All three of the patents at \nissue have effective filing dates earlier than 2013. I will, therefore, cite only to the \npre-AIA Act. \n7 patents might stifle, rather than promote, the progress of useful arts.\" Id. ( citing \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8). \nThe Court reaffirmed in KSR that the \"framework\" set out in the following \nparagraph from Graham governs the application of\u00a7 103, id. at 406: \nWhile the ultimate question of patent validity is one of \nlaw, the [ \u00a7] 103 condition [ of patentability] ... lends itself \nto several basic factual inquiries. Under[\u00a7] 103, the scope \nand content of the prior art are to be determined; \ndifferences between the prior art and the claims at issue \nare to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the \npertinent art resolved. Against this background, the \nobviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is \ndetermined. Such secondary considerations as \ncommercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure \nof others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the \ncircumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter \nsought to be patented. As indicia of obviousness or \nnonobviousness, these inquiries may have relevancy. \nGraham, 383 U.S. at 14-15 (citations omitted). \nIt is clear that under this framework, a district court must consider in an \nobviousness inquiry the three primary factors identified by the Court in Graham: \n(1) the scope and content of the prior art, (2) the differences between the prior art \nand the claims at issue, and (3) the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art. Less \nclear is the role, if any, secondary considerations should play in the analysis. \nThe logical-some would say necessary-implication of the Court's use of \nthe word \"secondary\" in Graham and its holding that the secondary considerations \n\"might be utilized\" and \"may have relevancy\" is that a district court is permitted-\n8 but not required in all cases-to examine such considerations in evaluating an \nobviousness-based invalidity challenge. The Court seemed to confirm as much in \nKSR, when it noted that \"Graham set forth a broad inquiry and invited courts, \nwhere appropriate, to look at any secondary considerations that would prove \ninstructive.\" KSR, 550 U.S. at 415 (emphasis added). \nBut a district court ignores Graham's \"invitation\" to examine secondary \nconsiderations at its peril. One legal scholar, Harmon, has observed that under \nFederal Circuit law \"[w]e are able now safely to strike the 'may' in the ... \nsentence\" in Graham in which the Court stated that secondary \"indicia of \nobviousness and nonobviousness ... may have relevancy.\" Robert Harmon, \nCynthia Homan, & Laura Lydigsen, Patents and the Federal Circuit 245 (13th ed. \n2017). Harmon correctly notes that \"[t]he Federal Circuit has emphatically and \nrepeatedly held that objective evidence of non-obviousness must be taken into \naccount always and not just when the decisionmaker is in doubt.\" Id. In \nStratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., 713 F.2d 1530 (Fed. Cir. 1983), for example, the \nFederal Circuit held that \"evidence rising out of the so-called 'secondary \nconsiderations' must always when present be considered en route to a \ndetermination of obviousness.\" Id. at 1538. And in In re Cyclobenzaprine \nHydrochloride Extended-Release Capsule Patent Litigation, 676 F.3d 1063 (Fed. \nCir. 2012), the Federal Circuit reaffirmed that holding, id. at 1079, and went on to \n9 say that the Supreme Court in Graham \"did not relegate ... to 'secondary status\"' \nthe \"objective factors\" the Supreme Court had explicitly identified in Graham as \n\"secondary considerations,\" id. at 1078. \nIt is true that less than a month after In re Cyclobenzaprine, a different \nFederal Circuit panel held in Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. v. Sandoz, Inc., 678 F.3d \n1280 (Fed. Cir. 2012), that because it found that the defendants had \"failed to \nprove that [ the challenged patent claim] would have been prima facie obvious over \nthe asserted prior art,\" it \"need not address\" the \"objective evidence\" of \ncommercial success, long-felt need, and the failure of others. Id. at 1296. But the \nsafer course for a district court faced with an obviousness challenge is to treat \nGraham's invitation to look at secondary considerations like a subpoena. \nObviousness is assessed based on the perspective of an artisan of ordinary \nskill at the time of the invention. Unigene Labs., Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 655 F.3d \n1352, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The court therefore needs to guard against \"hindsight \nbias\" that infers from the inventor's success in making the patented invention that \nthe invention was obvious. In re Cyclobenzaprine, 676 F.3d at 1079. The ultimate \nquestion in the obviousness analysis is \"whether there was an apparent reason [ for \nan artisan of ordinary skill] to combine [at the time of the invention] the known \nelements in the fashion claimed by the patent at issue.\" KSR, 550 U.S. at 418. \n\"The analysis is objective.\" Id. at 406. Thus, a court must determine whether an \n10 artisan of ordinary skill \"would have had reason to combine the teaching of the \nprior art references to achieve the claimed invention, and ... would have had a \nreasonable expectation of success [in] doing so.\" In re Cyclobenzaprine, 676 F .3d \nat 1069. \nThe party challenging the patent's validity bears the burden of proving \nobviousness by clear and convincing evidence. Id. at 1068-69. In weighing the \nGraham factors to decide whether the party has met that burden, the district court \nmust be guided by common sense. Wyers v. Master Lock Co., 616 F.3d 1231, \n1238 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Indeed, \"the legal determination of obviousness may \ninclude recourse to logic, judgment, and common sense, in lieu of expert \ntestimony.\" Id. at 1239. In KSR, the Supreme Court warned lower courts to avoid \n\"[r]igid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense\" and to \nemploy instead \"an expansive and flexible approach\" under the Graham \nframework. KSR, 550 U.S. at 415,421. Thus, the district court may \"reorder[] in \nany particular case\" the \"sequence\" in which it considers the Graham factors. Id. \nat 407. And although a court should consider carefully the published prior art, \n\"[t]he obviousness analysis cannot be confined by ... overemphasis on the \nimportance of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents.\" Id. at \n419. \n11 \"[A]ny need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of the \ninvention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the \nelements in the manner claimed.\" Id. at 420. And \"[t]he combination of familiar \nelements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more \nthan yield predictable results.\" Id. at 416. \"[T]he fact that a combination was \nobvious to try might show that it was obvious under\u00a7 103.\" Id. at 421. But a \ncombination is obvious to try only \"[ w ]hen there is a design need or market \npressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable \nsolutions\" in the prior art at the time of the invention. Id. And the court must also \nbe mindful that \"when the prior art teaches away from combining certain known \nelements, discovery of a successful means of combining them is more likely to be \nnonobvious.\" Id. at 416. \nB. Anticipation \nAn asserted patent claim is invalid under \u00a7 102 of the Patent Act as \nanticipated if the accused infringer presents clear and convincing evidence that a \nsingle prior art reference disclosed, either expressly or inherently, each limitation \nof the claim. Brassica Protection Prods. LLC v. Sunrise Farms (In re Cruciferous \nSprout Litig.), 301 F.3d 1343, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2002) .. \n12 IV. ANALYSIS \nAlvogen contends that all the asserted claims are invalid as obvious and that \nsome of the asserted claims of the #866 and #843 patents are anticipated. \nA. Obviousness \nAlvogen advances distinct theories for the obviousness of the #866 and #843 \npatents and for the obviousness of the #539 patent. Alvogen argues that claims 3 \nand 10 of the #866 patent and claims 8, 9, and 20 of the #843 patent are invalid \nbecause it would have been obvious to utilize buprenorphine in a two-layer \nmucoadhesive device for transmucosal delivery of drugs and because it would have \nbeen obvious to buffer the mucoadhesive layer to the claimed pH range since that \nrange is optimal for delivering buprenorphine. D.I. 258 at 28. Alvogen \nadditionally argues that claims 4 and 5 of the #866 patent are invalid because, \nexcept for obvious pharmacokinetic properties, they are broader than asserted \nclaim 3. D.I. 248 at 38-40. \nFor the #539 patent, Alvogen argues that claim 9 is invalid for obviousness \nbecause the claimed pH range for the backing layer is inherently disclosed in the \nprior art. D.I. 258 at 43-45. Alvogen argues that claim 20 is obvious because, in \naddition to buffering the backing layer, the only other previously undisclosed \nlimitations are obvious pharmacological properties. D.I. 258 at 46-50. \n13 1. Definition of the Artisan of Ordinary Skill in the Art \nThe parties offer different definitions of an artisan of ordinary skill in the \nart), but BDSI agrees that my choice of definition does not make a difference in \nthis case. Tr. 722:1-4; D.I. 260 ,r DFF 5. Therefore, I adopt Alvogen's proposed \ndefinition, and find that an artisan of ordinary skill would have a bachelor's degree \nin pharmaceutical sciences, chemistry or related field, plus three to five years of \nrelevant experience in developing transmucosal dosage forms. Alternatively, an \nartisan of ordinary skill would have a Ph.D. in pharmaceutical sciences, chemistry, \nor a related field and slightly less practical experience. Tr. 87 :5-21. \n2. Obviousness of the #866 and #843 Patents \na. Findings of Fact \n1) Relevant Chemical and Pharmacological \nConcepts \nWhen formulating a drug, relevant properties of the active ingredient include \nsolubility (the ability of the molecule to dissolve) and absorption (the tendency of \nthe drug to be absorbed into the body). Uptake is another term for the absorption \nof a drug from a device into the body. Tr. 175:1-2. Buprenorphine has low \nsolubility and high uptake. Tr. 700:22-25. \nThe chemical properties of some compounds, including Buprenorphine, are \nsensitive to pH. pH is a measure of acidity and basicity: the lower the pH of a \n14 solution the more acidic the solution is and the higher the pH of a solution the \nmore basic it is. The pH of pure water is 7, and thus that pH is deemed neutral. \nLemon juice is acidic with a pH around 2, and bleach is basic with a pH around 13. \nTr. 146:18-147:6. Buffers are solutions that resist pH change upon the addition of \nacids and bases. Buffers are created with buffering agents, which are pairs of a \nweak acid or base and its corresponding conjugate base or acid, for example citric \nacid and sodium citrate. Tr. 153:5-81; Tr. 694:18-20. \nThe pH of the surrounding environment influences the electrical charge of \nbuprenorphine. At acidic pHs, below roughly 6.5, nearly 100% of buprenorphine \nis positively charged. Tr. 12:12-14. An artisan of ordinary skill can easily \ncalculate the portion of a compound that is in a particular ionization state at a given \npH using a formula called the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. Tr. 163: 18-164:4, \n795 :22-796: 12. \nThe electrical charge of a drug impacts the solubility of the active ingredient. \nMolecules generally dissolve more easily in either aqueous solutions or solutions \nof oils and fats, which chemical artisans call lipids. Molecules that are soluble in \nlipids are deemed lipophilic, whereas molecules that dissolve in aqueous solutions \nare hydrophilic. Lipophilicity can be characterized by measuring a compound's \npartition coefficient; a higher partition coefficient indicates greater lipophilicity. \nTr. 791:2-7, 792:13-18, 793:16-794:25. Neutrally charged molecules are \n15 typically lipophilic. Tr. 731: 1-7. However, these trends are not universal; the \nchemical properties of a molecule are determined by the totality of its structure. \nCrucially, buprenorphine is lipophilic even when ionized. Tr. 98:8-10; DTX-165 \nat 5. \nWhether an active ingredient is ionized also effects how well the drug is \nabsorbed into the body. The body's cells are surrounded by a membrane \nconsisting of a phospholipid bilayer. Lipophilic molecules pass through this \nbilayer more easily than hydrophilic molecules, and thus lipophilicity is associated \nwith higher absorption. As a result, the neutrally charged form of a compound is \nusually more readily absorbed into the body than a charged form of the compound. \nTr. 782:12-784:4. This trend is called the pH partition theory or pH partition \nhypothesis. Tr. 795: 1-9. \nWhen a drug is absorbed, not all of the drug actually reaches the target \ntissue. The fraction of the active ingredient that reaches the target tissue intact is \nthe bioavailability of the drug formulation. For buprenorphine, bioavailability is \nmeasured based on the portion of the opioid that reaches the blood plasma. When \na drug is delivered orally, such as with a pill or a tablet, it goes through first-pass \nmetabolism before reaching the bloodstream. In first-pass metabolism, drugs are \nprocessed by the liver where they are broken down into non-therapeutically active \n16 metabolites. Tr. 93:21-94:9. First-pass metabolism and low absorption can both \nlead to a low bioavailability. \nSeveral of the asserted claims include phannacokinetic properties. \nPhannacokinetics is, roughly speaking, the study of how drugs are absorbed and \nprocessed by the body. Tr. 322:5-10. Pharmacokinetic properties depend on the \ndrug, device, and dose of the drug. Tr. 325:17-19. The properties at issue in this \ncase are the time it takes from administration for the drug to have a measurable \nconcentration in the blood (T first), Tr. 327: 13-19, the length of time a clinically \neffective plasma concentration is maintained, and the maximum blood plasma \nconcentration of a drug following administration (Cmax), Tr. 325:9-15. The steady \nstate Cmax is the Cmax that is consistently obtained after multiple administrations of a \ndrug. Tr. 327:4-7. \n2) Content of the Asserted Claims \nThe asserted claims of the #866 and #843 patents are directed to devices for \nadministering buprenorphine and methods using those same devices. Claim 10 \n( which depends from claim 8) of the #866 patent claims a \"mucoadhesive \nbioerodable drug delivery device suitable for direct transmucosal administration of \nbuprenorphine to a subject\" comprising four elements: (1) \"a bioerodable \nmucoadhesive layer comprising an effective amount of buprenorphine disposed in \na polymeric diffusion environment,\" (2) \"wherein the polymeric diffusion \n17 environment is a buffered environment,\" (3) in which \"the pH of the polymeric \ndiffusion environment is between about 4.5 and about 5 ,\" and ( 4) \"a barrier layer \ncomprising a polymeric barrier environment disposed adjacent to the \nmucoadhesive layer to provide a unidirectional gradient upon application to a \nmucosal surface for the rapid and efficient delivery ofbuprenorphine.\" Claim 3 \n(which depends from claim 1) covers a \"method for providing enhanced uptake of \nbuprenorphine to a subject by direct transmucosal delivery ofbuprenorphine\" \nwhere buprenorphine is administered to a subject by applying the device claimed \nin claim 10 \"to an oral mucosal surface of the subject\" where \"the unidirectional \ngradient delivers buprenorphine across the buffered polymeric diffusion \nenvironment upon application to the mucosa! surface.\" Claims 4 and 5 (which also \ndepend from claim 1) cover the same method as claim 3 except that they add \ncertain pharmacokinetic properties as limitations and they allow the polymeric \ndiffusion environment to be buffered to a pH between about 4 and about 6. \nSpecifically, claim 4 requires \"a first quantifiable plasma concentration of \nbuprenorphine is observed at about 45 minutes\" and claim 5 requires \"an effective \nplasma concentration ofbuprenorphine is maintained for at least 4 hours.\" \nThe asserted claims of the #843 patent cover methods and devices \"for \ndelivering buprenorphine to humans.\" #843 patent claims 1 (27:9), 13 (27:54). \nClaim 20 ( which depends from claim 13) covers a device that comprises ( 1) \"a \n18 bioerodible mucoadhesive layer comprising buprenorphine disposed in a polymeric \ndiffusion environment\" (2) \"wherein the polymeric diffusion environment has a pH \nbuffered to between about 4 to about 6\" and (3) \"a polymeric barrier environment \ndisposed adjacent to the mucoadhesive layer, and wherein a unidirectional \ndiffusion gradient ofbuprenorphine is provided upon application to a buccal \nsurface of a human.\" Claims 8 and 9 ( which depend ultimately from claim 1) \ncover administering the device claimed in claim 20 with some variations in the \nclaimed pH range and additional limitations. Claim 8 requires that the polymeric \ndiffusion environment is buffered to a pH between about 4 and about 6. Claim 9 \nrequires that the polymeric diffusion environment is buffered to a pH between \nabout 4 and about 7.5 and further requires that the polymeric diffusion \nenvironment comprises at least one film-forming water-erodible adhesive polymer \nand at least one bioadhesive polymer. \n3) Content of the Prior Art \nAlvogen identified in their briefing nine prior art references relevant to the \nobviousness of the #866 and #843 patents. \na) Tapolsky (DTX-173) \nTapolsky is the application that became the #019 patent. DTX-173. It \nteaches a two-layer device for delivering a pharmaceutical to the mucosal surface. \nDTX-173 at abstract. The two layers are an adhesive layer that attaches to the \n19 mucosal surface and a backing layer. Tr. 106:20-107:3; DTX-173 ,r 30. Tapolsky \nalso suggests using a third layer to create a unidirectional gradient to force the drug \ntowards the mucosa. Tr. 109:15-21; DTX-173 ,r 60. \nTapolsky does not use the term BEMA, but Dr. Michniak-Kohn, Alvogen's \nexpert on transmucosal drug delivery, explained at trial that Belbuca\u00ae is built on \nthe platform technology disclosed in Tapolsky. Tr. 117:6--20. Tapolsky teaches \nmaking an adhesive layer with a water erodible polymer, such as hydroxyethyl \ncellulose or hydroxypropyl cellulose, and a bioadhesive polymer, such as sodium \ncarboxymethyl cellulose. Tr. 107:22-108:18; DTX-173 ,r,r 31-32. The backing \nlayer is made with a water erodible, film-forming polymer such as hydroxyethyl \ncellulose or hydroxypropyl cellulose. Tr. 109:7-11; DTX-173 ,r 35. \nTapolsky teaches that butorphanol, an opioid, may be used with the \ndisclosed device. Tr. 684:12-18; DTX-173 ,r 53. Tapolsky does not use the \nwords \"polymeric diffusion environment\" or teach buffering the layers of the \ndevice to a particular pH. Tr. 262:3-6. \nTapolsky disclosed experimental pharmacokinetic results for experiments in \ndogs using testosterone and albuterol sulfate as the chemicals of interest. Tr. \n346:4-14; DTX-173 ,r 128. Tapolsky reported measurable albuterol sulfate levels \nfor over four hours. Tr. 346:4-14; DTX-173 ,r 139, Table 5. Tapolsky does not \n20 provide any human pharmacokinetic data or any pharmacokinetic data for \nbuprenorphine. Tr. 262:15-18. \nb) Moro (DTX-178) \nMoro is a patent application titled \"Mucoadhesive Erodable Drug Delivery \nDevice for Controlled Administration of Pharmaceuticals and Other Active \nCompounds.\" DTX-178. It was published in March 2003. DTX-178 at 1. Moro \ndiscloses a multilayer, bioerodable mucosal drug-delivery device with a water\u00ad\nsoluble adhesive layer and a non-adhesive bioerodaible backing layer. Tr. 118:14-\n119:17; DTX-178 at abstract, ,r 35. Moro explains that a pharmaceutical can be \nplaced in either or both layers. Tr. 118:18-19; DTX-178 at abstract. Moro \nsuggests hydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose as water soluble \npolymers and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a bioadhesive polymer. Tr. \n119:2-17; DTX-178 ,r,r 41, 43. Thus, Moro discloses a bioerdable drug delivery \ndevice that is very similar to the Tapolsky device and to the device claimed in the \nasserted patents. Tr. 118:16-22. Moro lists numerous active ingredients that could \nbe used with this device, including buprenorphine. Tr. 118:8-11; DTX-178 ,r,r 48, \n64. \nc) Johnson (DTX-165) \nJohnson is a 2005 review article by Rolley E. Johnson, Paul J. Fudala, and \nRichard Payne titled \"Buprenorphine: Considerations for Pain Management.\" \n21 DTX-165. Johnson reviews what artisans of ordinary skill knew about \nbuprenorphine at the time of publication. Tr. 96:13-98:1; DTX-165 at 1. \nBuprenorphine was recognized as an extremely lipophilic compound. Tr. 98:8-12; \nDTX-165 at 5. Johnson also explains that sublingual delivery avoids first-pass \nmetabolism. DTX-165 at 2. \nd) Cassidy (JTX-248) \nCassidy is a 1993 article by J.P. Cassidy, N .M. Landzert and E. Quandros, \ntitled \"Controlled Buccal Delivery ofBuprenorphine.\" JTX-248. Cassidy teaches \nthat buccal drug delivery devices avoid first-pass metabolism. Tr 95:10-13; JTX-\n248 at 1. Cassidy further teaches that the solubility ofbuprenorphine varies with \npH. Tr. 147:17-23. Figure 1 of Cassidy shows that the solubility of \nbuprenorphine hydrochloride increases as pH decreases, with the maximum \nreported solubility between a pH of about 4 and 5. Tr. 150:12-18; JTX-248 at 4, \nFig. 1. The solubility ofbuprenorphine in all measurements at a pH lower than five \nwas considerably greater than the solubility of buprenorphine in all measurements \nat a pH greater than five. JTX-248 at Fig. 1. Cassidy reports a slightly reduced \nsolubility in the physiological TPS buffer at a pH of 4.2 relative to a phosphate \nbuffer at the same pH. JTX-248 at 4. The measured solubility ofbuprenorphine in \nthe TPS buffer at a pH of 4.2 was similar to the measured solubility in the TPS \nbuffer solutions at other pH values less than five. JTX-248 at Fig. 1. To the extent \n22 this data point is an outlier it may be explained because the TPS buffer has a lower \nbuffering capacity at this pH. Tr. 149:24-150:9. \ne) Bullingham I {DTX-077) \nBullingham I is the 1981 academic publication \"Sublingual Buprenorphine \nUsed Postoperatively: Clinical Observations and Preliminary Pharmacokinetic \nAnalysis\" by R.E.S. Bullingham et al. DTX-077. Bullingham I investigated the \npharmacokinetics ofbuprenorphine administered via sublingual tablets. Tr. 91:5-\n19; DTX-077 at 2. Subjects received buprenorphine sublingually only after \nreceiving buprenorphine intravenously earlier in the day. Tr. 404:23-404:22; \nDTX-077 at 2. Bullingham attempted to account for the intravenous \nbuprenorphine by reducing the measured buprenorphine amounts based on prior \nresearch about the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine when delivered \nintravenously. Tr. 812:14-814:4; DTX-077 at 3. Bullingham I states that \"the \nsuitability of [buprenorphine] for [ sub lingual administration] is suggested by its \nhigh lipophilicity, high first pass effect, long duration of action and low addition \npotential.\" DTX-077 at 1; see also Tr. 91:16-19. \nf) Suboxone\u00ae Tablets \nThe FDA approved Suboxone\u00ae sublingual tablets with buprenorphine as the \nactive ingredient in 2002. Tr. 480:12-17; JTX-471 at 3, Fig. 1. Suboxone\u00ae is \nindicated for the treatment of opioid dependence. DTX-172 at 7. \n23 The parties debate the pH of Suboxone\u00ae. Among its inactive ingredients, \nSuboxone\u00ae includes citric acid and sodium citrate. Tr. 694:12-23; DTX-172 at 2. \nCitric acid and sodium citrate can be used to buffer a solution to a pH between four \nand six. Tr. 174:19-11, 671:16-23, 733:20-23, 804:23-805:2. In 2011, Dr. Finn, \nan inventor of the asserted patents, told the Patent Office that the pH of Suboxone \nwas \"NIA.\" Tr. 697:24-5; JTX-365 at 4. Later in 2014, Dr. Reitman, a \npharmaceutical formulations expert, reported to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board \non behalf of BDSI, which was the petitioner an inter partes review proceeding \ninvolving Suboxone\u00ae, that when a Suboxone\u00ae tablet was dissolved in either 1.5 or \n3.0 mL of deionized water the resulting pH was 3.5. Tr. 163:20-162:3; DTX-365 \n,I 5. Dr. Michniak Kohn testified that the only source for a pH of Suboxone\u00ae was \nthe Reitman declaration. Tr. 154:11-155:3. \ng) Weinberg (JTX-249) \nWeinberg, an article published in 1988 with the title \"Sublingual Absorption \nof Selected Opioid Analgesics\" teaches that buprenorphine has a higher partition \ncoefficient than other common opioids. Tr. 137:20-138:13; JTX-249 at 2, Table 1. \nWeinberg also teaches that buprenorphine is well-absorbed even when ionized and \nthat its lipophilicity at more basic pHs could not be measured because of poor \nsolubility at those pHs. Tr. 170:14-171 :2; JTX-249 at 6. \n24 h) Birch {DTX-203) \nBirch is a patent application published in 2005 that teaches aqueous \nbuprenorphine solutions buffered to a pH between 3 and 4.8. Tr. 171 :24-172:5; \nDTX-203171. These solutions were designed for intranasal delivery. Tr. 171: 17-\n21; DTX-203 at abstract. \ni) Todd(DTX-174) \nTodd is a European patent application published in 1983. It teaches an \naqueous buprenorphine solution for sublingual administration. Tr. 173:20-23; \nDTX-174 at abstract. Todd discloses a pharmaceutical solution with \nbuprenorphine dissolved in 20 to 30 percent ethanol and buffered to a pH between \n4.5 and 5.5. Tr. 173:20-23; DTX-174 at 3. This formulation was designed to \novercome buprenorphine's inadequate solubility in higher pH solutions. Tr. \n653:4-16; DTX-174 at 3. Todd also disclosed that uptake was higher when the \nbuprenorphine solution was buffered to a pH of 5 or 6 compared to 4. DTX-17 4 at \n3. Todd reported that preparing a stable solution with an adequate buprenorphine \nconcentration was \"very difficult.\" Tr. 653:1-9; DTX-174 at 3. \n4) Mechanism of Action for the Tapolsky Device \nDelivery of buprenorphine using the Tapolsky device requires both the \ndissolution of buprenorphine and the penetration of the drug into the mucosa. \nWhen the claimed drug delivery device is placed into the mouth it is a solid. Tr. \n25 701: 11-12. The mucoadhesive layer absorbs moisture from the mucosa, allowing \nthe device to adhere to the mucosa! surface. Tr. 132:3-13. To be absorbed into the \nmucosa, the buprenorphine must dissolve so it is no longer trapped in the \nmucoadhesive layer's initially solid polymeric environment and is able to pass \nthrough cellular membranes into the body. Tr. 132:3-13. Dr. Williams, BDSI's \nexpert on pharmaceutical formulations, agreed that when the claimed invention is \nplaced against the.cheek saliva penetrates the mucoadhesive layer, creating a \nmicroenvironment in which the molecules of buprenorphine gradually dissolve. \nTr. 701: 13-702:5. \nBecause of the backing layer, once the buprenorphine dissolves it largely \nflows into the cheek's mucosa} tissue. Tr. 587:12-18. Dr. Williams testified that \nan artisan of ordinary skill would have understood that the barrier layer in the \nasserted patents \"stops or slows the diffusion of the drug out into the oral cavity,\" \nthereby creating a \"unidirectional gradient so that the drug moves from the \npolymeric diffusion environment directly into the mucosa of the subject.\" Tr. \n587:12-18. While Tapolsky describes using a third layer to achieve unidirectional \nrelease, an artisan of ordinary skill would have understood based on Tapolsky that \na single backing layer could provide a unidirectional gradient. Tr. 586:21-587:19; \nDTX-173 ,r 58. Moro also teaches the use of a backing layer to improve \nbioavailability and create unidirectional delivery. Tr. 120:1-7; DTX-178 iJ 46. \n26 5) Use of Buprenorphine in the Tapolsky Device \nAn artisan of ordinary skill would have been motivated to use buprenorphine \nin the drug-delivery platform disclosed by Tapolsky ( or the similar platform \ndisclosed by Moro). Tapolsky teaches a method for buccal delivery of \npharmaceuticals that produces excellent bioavailability, fast onset, and sustained \ndelivery. DTX-173 ,r,r 13, 131. Tapolsky explains that the disclosed delivery \ndevice was appropriate for use with numerous pharmaceuticals. DTX-173 ,r,r 46-\n53. \nBuprenorphine was known in the prior art as a potent opioid analgesic. Tr. \n91 : 13-19, 94 :23-25; JTX-248 at 1, 9. Prior references, including Cassidy and \nBullingham I, taught that buprenorphine had a high first pass effect and thus \nalternative delivery methods, such as transmucosal delivery, could offer better \nbioavailability than oral formulations (e.g., a pill or tablet). Tr. 94:21-95: 13; \nDTX-248 at 1; DTX-077 at 1. An artisan of ordinary skill would have been \nmotivated to combine buprenorphine with Tapolsky, because she would have \nrecognized that delivering buprenorphine in the Tapolsky device could reduce first \npass effects while also improving bioavailability. \nAn artisan of ordinary skill also would have had a reasonable likelihood of \nsuccess in delivering buprenorphine with the Tapolsky device. Tapolsky and Moro \nteach the use of opioids-including buprenorphine in the case of Moro--in buccal \n27 drug delivery devices. Tr. 111:6-7, 118:8-16; DTX-173 ,r 53; DTX-178 ,r,r 35, 64. \nAnd the prior work on buprenorphine disclosed in Todd, Weinberg, and \nBullingham showed the drug was amenable to delivery through the mouth's \nmucosa! tissue. Tr. 91: 5-19, 170:23-171:2, 173:18-174:6; DTX-077 at 1, 5; \nDTX-174 at 1; JTX-249 at 6. Formulating a version of the Tapolsky drug delivery \ndevice with an effective amount ofbuprenorphine would have been a matter of \nroutine skill. Tr.134:3-9. Considering this information together, an artisan of \nordinary skill would have understood that buprenorphine was suitable for use in \nthe Tapolsky drug-delivery device and would have had a reasonable expectation of \nsuccessfully using the Tapolsky device to deliver buprenorphine. Tr. 121 :9-17, \n130:7-20. \n6) Buffering the Mucoadhesive Layer to the \nClaimed pH \nIn creating a bilayer mucoadhesive film with buprenorphine, an artisan of \nordinary skill in the art would have buffered the mucoadhesive layer to the pH \nrange that she expects to maximize bioavailability. To do so, the artisan would \nconsidered both the solubility and absorption of buprenorphine. \nBecause a drug must dissolve in order to be absorbed into the mucosa, an \nartisian of ordinary skill would have been motivated to use the buprenorphine \nsolubility information reported in Cassidy in formulating a buccal drug delivery \ndevice with buprenorphine. Cassidy discloses that the solubility of buprenorphine \n28 is highly pH dependent and is substantially greater below a pH of 5. Tr. 146:6-12, \n147:17-23, 150:15-17; JTX-248 at 4, Fig. 1. Even if solubility depends on the \nspecific solution as BDSI argues, see D.I. 260 ,r PFF51 (citing Tr. 624:12-16, \n706:5-9), Cassidy would have provided an artisan of ordinary skill reason to \nexpect greater solubility when the pH of the local environment around the \nbuprenorphine is below 5, Tr. 153:2-153:20; JTX-248 at 4. An artisan of ordinary \nskill, therefore, would have been motivated to formulate the drug delivery \nenvironment for buprenorphine, that is the mucoadhesive layer, to have a pH of 4 \nto 5, which Cassidy identifies as the pH range for maximum buprenorphine \nsolubility. Tr. 150:15-17; JTX-248 at 4, Fig. 1. \nAnd based on the good absorption reported in Todd, an artisan of ordinary \nskill would have had a reasonable expectation of observing good absorption of \nbuprenorphine in the same pH range using the Tapolsky device. Tr. 175:16-25; \n200:22-201:12; Tr. 671:16-672:12. An artisan of ordinary skill would have \nfurther expected success in formulating buprenorphine at this pH range because as \nof 2006 there were no examples in the prior art of buprenorphine formulations with \na pH greater than 6.5, but there were several examples of formulations at acidic \n29 pHs. Tr. 176:6-9, 202:1-4; DTX-174 at 3 (using a pH range of 4.5-5.5); DTX-\n203 at ,r 71 (using a pH range of 3 to 4.8); JTX-249 at 1 (using a pH of 6.5).2 \nBDSI argues that an artisan would not have been motivated to use the \nclaimed pH range, because an artisan would understand that below a pH of 6 \nBuprenorphine is nearly 100 percent ionized and that drugs are better absorbed \nwhen not ionized. D.I. 261 at 31; Tr. 672:3-7; Tr. 798:6-20 (explaining the pH \npartition hypothesis). But an artisan of ordinary skill would have readily \nunderstood that buprenorphine behaves differently than a generic ionic compound. \nIt is undisputed that the chemical properties of compounds vary based on their \nunique composition and molecular arrangement. Tr. 254:17-23.3 And Todd \nexplains that buprenorphine has good uptake in the pH range of 4 to 6-a range in \nwhich buprenorphine is ionized. Tr. 672:8-12. Johnson and Bullingham I further \nteach that buprenorphine is extremely lipophilic. DTX-165 at 5; DTX-077 at 1. \n2 The parties dispute how to measure the pH of Suboxone\u00ae and whether \nSuboxone\u00ae is buffered to a pH of 3.5. D.I. 260 ,r DFF93. However, there was no \nsuggestion at trial that Suboxone\u00ae is buffered to a pH greater than 6.5 or that any \nprior art before 2006 discloses a pH for suboxone\u00ae above 6.5. \n3 In arguing that it would have been nonobvious to use buprenorphine in a bilayer \nmucoadhesive device, BDSI argues that the \"the evidence at trial established that \nall opioids do not work the same way in solid film devices.\" D.I. 261 at 27. But in \narguing that that an artisan of ordinary skill would not have been motivated to \nbuffer the mucoadhesive layer to the claimed pH ranges, BDSI argues that \"all ... \nweakly basic compounds such as fentanyl [and buprenorphine] were expected to \nbehave the same.\" D.I. 261 at 32. BDSI cannot have it both ways. \n30 An artisan of ordinary skill would have known that lipophilic compounds, \nincluding buprenorphine, are more easily absorbed into the body. Tr. 783:22-\n784:4. The artisan would have been motivated to use the claimed pH range \nbecause of its solubility properties and would have understood that buprenorphine \nis sufficiently absorbed at these pH ranges to have a reasonable expectation of \nsuccess. \nI recognize that Dr. Davies, BDSI' s chemistry expert, testified that an artisan \nof ordinary skill \"would expect the most efficient uptake [ of buprenorphine] to be \n... between [a pH of] about 6 and 10. Between about 8 and 10.\" Tr. 741:17-18. \nDr. Davies further testified that \"significant\" amounts of unionized buprenorphine \nexist in the pH range of 8 to 10. Tr. 741:20-21. But crucially this testimony was \nconditioned on buprenorphine already being solubilized. The question that Dr. \nDavies provided the quoted answer to was \"In your opinion, would a person of \nordinary skill in the art have expected, based on the prior art including Todd, that if \nany solubility problems of buprenorphine could be overcome, that buprenorphine \nuptake would be most efficient at higher pH values?\" Tr. 7 41: 12-16 ( emphasis \nadded). Yet, \"bioavailability depends both on solubility and permeability.\" Tr. \n793 :8-9. As of 2006 the prior art taught that buprenorphine needed to be \nformulated at pHs below 6.5 to dissolve and that buprenorphine's solubility is \n31 maximized in solutions with a pH below 5. Accordingly, I do not find Dr. Davis' \ntestimony on this point probative. \n7) Pharmacokinetic Properties \nAlvogen's phannacokinetics expert, Dr. Shafer, explained that \nphannacokinetic properties are specific to a particular delivery device, drug, and \ndose combination. Tr.328:6-12. Thus, the pharmacokinetic properties of a \nparticular delivery device, drug, and dose combination do not necessarily suggest \nthe properties of other combinations. \nAlvogen has not identified any dosage that an artisan of ordinary skill would \nhave used when formulating a Tapolsky device with buprenorphine. Although an \nartisan of ordinary skill might have been motivated to formulate a device for \ntransmucosal delivery of buprenorphine in general, without a specific device, drug, \nand dose combination there cannot be any inherent phannacokinetic properties. 4 \nAdditionally, there would have been no motivation for an artisan of ordinary \nskill to achieve the claimed phannacokinetic results. Alvogen itself argues that \n4 Alvogen waived the argument that the phannacokinetic properties are inherent in \nTapolsky alone by not raising that contention before trial. See Hr'g, June 8, 2021 \n(granting motion to strike). Accordingly, I only consider the inherency argument \nwith respect to the obviousness combination ofTapolsky (or Moro), Todd, and \nBullingham I, which was disclosed prior to trial. But as explained below, there \nwas also no motivation to combine Bullingham I with other references to obtain \nthe claimed pharmacokinetic properties, and thus the inherency argument is \nincomplete on that basis as well. \n32 \"the parameters of claim 4 and 5 are not meaningful.\" D.I. 258 at 40; see also . \nAnd Dr. Shafer, testified that \"[t]he FDA does not consider [time of first plasma \nconcentration] a useful or interesting parameter and neither do people skilled in the \nart of pharmacokinetics .... \" Tr. 329:25-330:3. Even assuming that the prior art \ncould have taught an artisan of ordinary skill how to achieve the claimed \npharmacokinetic properties with buprenorphine in a mucoadhesive device, an \nartisan of ordinary skill would have been indifferent to these claimed \npharmacokinetic properties and would have had no motivation to achieve them. \n8) Secondary Considerations \nBDSI offered at trial evidence of three secondary considerations: long-felt \nneed, unexpected results, and teaching away. I did not find this evidence to be \nprobative of nonobviousness for the following reasons. \na) Long-Felt, Unmet Need \nLong-felt but unresolved need is evidence of nonobviousness, because \"it is \nreasonable to infer that the need would have not persisted had the solution been \nobvious.\" WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co., 829 F.3d 1317, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2016). In \nassessing the presence or absence of long-felt need, I consider circumstances as \nthey existed at the filing date of the invention. Proctor & Gamble v. Teva Pharms. \nUSA Inc., 566 F.3d 989, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Whether a need is long felt is based \n33 on considering when the problem was identified and when there is evidence of \nefforts to solve that problem. WBIP, 829 F.3d at 1334. \nAs of the 2006 effective filing date of the #866 and #843 patents there was at \nleast some need for an opioid for chronic pain with reduced side effects and lower \nrisk of abuse, but the record evidence does not show this need was long felt. Tr. \n874:18-23, Tr. 898:17-24. The use of opioids for chronic pain became more \naccepted in the 1990s and 2000s; opioid sales increased rapidly over the 2000s, \npeaking in 2010. JTX-3000 at 2; JTX-403 at 1-2, Fig. 1. The evidence presented \nat trial shows that as of2006 there was a growing awareness of the need for \nalternative opioids and that the understanding in the profession was evolving. Tr. \n869:9-20, 935:12-22. The fact that there were unmet needs may only be clear \nthanks to the benefit of hindsight. The only evidence BDSI provided that artisans \nwere aware of limitations with available prescription opioids before 2006 was the \ntestimony of Dr. Rauck, BDSI's pain management medical expert, that artisans of \nordinary skill \"probably didn't know about [the opioid crises] as much until maybe \nthe early part of the 2000s that I recall, and I think what the documents would \nshow as well.\" Tr. 936:20-22. But the earliest piece of documentary evidence \nproduced at trial discussing opioid poisonings was published in September 2009. \nJTX-410. This evidence is not sufficient to show clearly and convincingly that \nBelbuca\u00ae answered a long felt, but unresolved need in medicine. \n34 BDSI identified several possible benefits of Belbuca\u00ae over the prior art. \nSee Tr. 548:16-549:12, 881:5-19, 922:5-25. But BDSI did not identify any \nprevious unsuccessful attempts to meet the needs satisfied by Belbuca\u00ae. No \nconcrete evidence presented at trial established when the problems supposedly \naddressed by the asserted patents became recognized or when the first efforts to \naddress those problems were. The evidence does not show, at the time of \ninvention, that there was a recognized long-felt, unmet need satisfied by the #866 \nand #843 patents. \nb) Teaching Away \nBDSI argues that the prior art taught away from using an acidic pH and \ninstead taught that using a more basic pH would lead to enhanced uptake. D.I. 261 \nat 49. This argument overlaps with Plaintiff's primary argument for \nnonobviousness. According to BDSI's argument, because Buprenorphine is a \nweakly basic compound it is ionized at acidic pHs. Tr. 756:3-5. It was well \nknown that chemical compounds are typically more readily absorbed through the \nmucosa! tissue when unionized. Tr. 630:1-6, 796:21-25. However, as I discussed \nabove, it was also known that buprenorphine was readily absorbed even when \nionized and that the challenges from solubility dominated any challenges from \nabsorption in formulating drugs with buprenorphine. See supra Part IIl{C)(2)( e ). \nWhile concerns about absorption may have favored a higher pH, the more pressing \n35 concern in formulating Belbuca\u00ae would have been solubility and the prior art \ntaught that a lower pH is favorable in overcoming this challenge. Tr. 153: 12-20, \n198:1-7. \nAdditionally, no prior art taught away from using an acidic pH with \nbuprenorphine. 5 The highest pH used to deliver buprenorphine in the prior art \nbefore development of Belbuca\u00ae was in Weinberg where buprenorphine was \ndelivered in a pH 6.5 solution. JTX-249 at 1, 3, Fig. 1. But at a pH of 6.5, over \n97.87% ofbuprenorphine is ionized, and Weinberg still reported that \nbuprenorphine was \"absorbed to a very high degree.\" Tr. 170:5-9, 670:12-14; \nDTX-377; JTX-249 at 6. Rather than suggesting that buprenorphine should be \ndelivered in a basic environment, Weinberg shows that an artisan of ordinary skill \nwould have had a reasonable expectation of success in obtaining good absorption \nof buprenorphine even in an environment where it is mostly ionized. I conclude \n5 There is one piece of prior art which seems to suggest the use of a higher pH with \nbuprenorphine: Dr. Michniak-Kohn et al.'s book chapter. DTX-355 at 11 \n(\"[S]tudies conducted with sublingual administration of opioids such as \nbuprenorphine, methadone, and fentany 1 showed increased absorption with \nincrease in pH, where the drug was predominantly present in the unionized form.\" \n(citing Weinberg (DTX-249)). But the relevant language relies on Weinberg and is \nclearly inconsistent with that reference with respect to Buprenorphine. Weinberg \ndid not observe an increase in absorption for buprenorphine when the drug was \npredominantly present in the unionized form. In fact, Weinberg only studied \nbuprenorphine at a single pH, which was 6.5 and at which buprenorphine is largely \nionized. DTX-249 at 6. Weinberg did not study buprenorphine in the unionized \nform because the drug was not soluble in more basic solutions. DTX-249 at 6. \n36 therefore that the prior art, when considered as a whole, did not teach away from \nusing a lower pH. \nc) Unexpected Results \nAn unexpected result can support a finding ofnonobviousness, because it \nsuggests that an artisan of ordinary skill would not have been motivated to develop \nan invention or would not have had a reasonable expectation of success. In re \nSoni, 54 F.3d 746, 750 (Fed. Cir. 1995). To suggest nonobviousness, \"evidence of \nunexpected results must establish that there is a difference between the results \nobtained and those of the closest prior art, and that the difference would not have \nbeen expected by one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention.\" \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 752 F.3d 967, 977 (Fed. Cir. \n2014). Additionally, \"differences in degree\" are less probative than \"difference in \nkind.\" Id. \nBDSI argues that the enhanced uptake of the claimed inventions was \nunexpected and that this supports nonobviousness. D.I. 261 at 53. I find, however, \nthat enhanced uptake was not unexpected for the invention claimed in the #866 and \n#843 patents. Tapolsky teaches a method for drug delivery that improves \nbioavailability. DTX-173 ,r 131 (\"the pharmaceutical carrier devices of the \ninvention yield ... excellent bioavailability\"). Improved bioavailability is not only \na difference in degree rather than kind, but is also the very improvement that would \n37 have motivated an artisan of ordinary skill to combine buprenorphine with the \nTapolsky platform in the first place. And it is not surprising that increased \nbioavailability is observed when the mucoadhesive layer is buffered to the pH \nrange in which buprenorphine is most soluble according to Cassidy. Tr. 183: 10-\n17. Rather than suggesting that the claimed invention was nonobvious, the \nimproved bioavailability merely illustrates why an artisan of ordinary skill would \nhave been motivated to combine the prior art. Cf Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. \nApotex Inc., 748 F.3d 1326, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\"The evidence of superior \nefficacy does nothing to undercut the showing that there was a reasonable \nexpectation of success ... , even if the level of success may have turned out to be \nsomewhat greater than would have been expected.\"). \nBDSI relies on Orexo AB v. Actavis Elizabeth LLC, 903 F.3d 1265 (Fed. Cir. \n2018). In Orexo, the Federal Circuit found that the district court improperly \ndiscounted the claimed formulation's 66% improvement \"in the context of th[ at] \ninvention.\" Id. at 1274. The Federal Circuit found that the 66% improvement \nshould be treated as a difference of kind rather than a difference of degree. Id. at \n1274. However, despite involving the same active ingredient, the facts of that case \nare quite different. In Orexo, the invention used the same route of administration, \nsublingual tablets, as the prior art. Id. at 1268. The novel aspect of the invention \nwas using citric acid as a carrier particle, and no prior art suggested that critic acid \n38 would be an effective carrier particle for buprenorphine. Id. at 1272-73. Because \nthe prior art did not suggest that the claimed invention would have improved \nbioavailability, the significantly improved bioavailability was surprising. Id. at \n1273. But here the prior art is exactly the opposite. Tapolsky teaches a way to \nimprove bioavailability, and so improved bioavailability when using the Tapolsky \nplatform is expected rather than surprising. \nBDSI also cites expert testimony at trial that the bioavailability of the \nclaimed inventions was unexpected. But the cited testimony is not indicative of \nnonobviousness. Dr. Taft, BDSI's expert in pharmacokinetics, testified that the \nbioavailability relative to suboxone was \"unexpected ... based on the pH partition \ntheory.\" Tr. 802:20-24. But, as discussed above, it was known that buprenorphine \nis very lipophilic and that the general predictions of the pH partition theory do not \nprovide a good description of the specific molecule at issue in this case. Thus, this \ntestimony does not establish that the results were unexpected. \nb. Conclusions of Law \n1) The Tapolsky Device \nThe structural elements of the claimed devices are ( 1) a bioerodable \nmucoadhesive layer with a pharmaceutical disposed in a polymeric diffusion and \n(2) a polymeric barrier environment disposed adjacent to the mucoadhesive layer \nto provide a unidirectional gradient. Claim 9 of the #843 patent further requires \n39 that the polymeric diffusion environment has at least one film-forming water \nerodible adhesive polymer and at least one bioadhesive polymer. \nThese elements are taught directly by Tapolsky. Tapolsky teaches the use of \na polymeric adhesive layer with a film-forming water erodible polymer and a \nbioadhesive polymer and also teaches the use of a polymeric non-adhesive backing \nlayer. DTX-173 iiiI 31-32, 35. Indeed, Tapolsky teaches that the layers can be \nmade with the very polymers that are used in Belbuca\u00ae. Tr. 108:7-10, 19-21; \nJTX-233 at 23. \n2) Use of Buprenorphine in a Tapolsky Device \nI have already found as a factual matter that Alvogen has shown by clear and \nconvincing evidence that an artisan of ordinary skill would have been motivated to \nuse buprenorphine in the Tapolsky drug delivery device based on Tapolsky and \nTodd. I also found as a factual matter that Todd would have given the artisan of \nordinary skill a reasonable expectation of success in making this combination. \nBased on these findings and because the secondary considerations are not \nprobative, I conclude that it was obvious to use buprenorphine in the Tapolsky \ndevice. \n3) Polymeric Diffusion Environment Buffered to \nthe Claimed pH Ranges \nGiven that it would have been obvious for an artisan of ordinary skill to use \nthe Tapolsky drug-delivery device with buprenorphine, the next question is \n40 whether it would have also been obvious to buffer the mucoadhesive layer to the \nclaimed pH ranges when using buprenorphine in the Tapolsky device. I find that it \nwould have been. \nAs I explained above, an artisan of ordinary skill would have been motivated \nbased on Todd in light of the prior art to buffer the local environment in the \nTapolsky drug-delivery device to a pH in the claimed ranges, including the \nnarrowest claimed range of about 4.5 to about 5. This is because the artisan of \nordinary skill would have understood that buprenorphine is only soluble in \nsolutions that are sufficiently acidic to ionize buprenorphine, but that once \ndissolved buprenorphine is easily absorbed into the body. \nFurthermore, the artisan of ordinary skill would have had a reasonable \nexpectation of success. Buprenorphine is suitable for use in buccal delivery \ndevices and is readily absorbed through the mucosa! tissue once dissolved. Tr. \n671:16-672:12, 175:16-25. This expectation would have been reinforced because \nthe other buprenorphine drugs in the prior art were also buffered to the same or \nsimilar pH ranges. Tr. 176:6-9, 202:1-4; DTX-174 at 3 (using a pH range of 4.5-\n5.5); DTX-203 ,I 71 (using a pH range of3 to 4.8). The use of buffers would have \nbeen familiar to someone having skill in the art. Tr. 153:3-9, 200:22-201:5. \nConsidering this information together, an artisan of ordinary skill would \nhave been motivated to formulate a Tapolsky device with the mucoadhesive layer \n41 buffered to the claimed pH ranges of about 4.5 to about 5, about 4.5 to about 5.5, \nabout 4 to about 6, and about 4 to 7 .5. The artisan of ordinary skill also would \nhave had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so. Again the secondary \nconsiderations were not probative and do not impact this obviousness analysis. \nFor these reasons, I find that the combination of a biodegradable \nmucoadhesive layer containing buprenorphine in a polymeric diffusion \nenvironment buffered to the claim pH ranges and a polymeric barrier environment \nthat provides a unidectional gradient was obvious. It also would have been \nobvious to use this device in a method for delivering buprenorphine and to use the \ndevice for delivery in humans. Accordingly, I find that claims 3 and 10 in the \n#866 patent and claims 8, 9, and 20 in the #843 patent are invalid for obviousness. \n4) Pharmacokinetic Properties of Claims 4 and 5 \nof the #866 Patent \nClaim 4 of the #866 patent requires that a first quantifiable plasma \nconcentration of buprenorphine is observed at about 45 minutes, and claim 5 of the \npatent requires that an effective plasma concentration of buprenorphine is \nmaintained for at least 4 hours. The other limitations of claim 4 and 5 are identical \nto claim 3, except that the pH range covered by claims 4 and 5 is between about 4 \nand about 6, which is broader than the pH range in claim 3. \nTo show that a pharmacokinetic limitation is obvious the party challenging a \npatent's validity must \"demonstrate that a skilled artisan would have been \n42 motivated to create a ... formulation of [the claimed pharmaceutical] with the[] \nclaimed [pharmacokinetic] characteristics.\" Tris Pharma, Inc. v. Actavis Labys \nFL, Inc., 755 F. App'x 983, 991 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Alternatively, the challenging \nparty can show that the claimed pharmacokinetic properties are inherent in an \nobvious combination. Persion Pharms. LLC v. Alvogen Malta Operations Ltd., \n945 F.3d 1184, 1190 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"[A]n obvious formulation cannot become \nnonobvious simply by administering it to a patient and claiming the resulting \nserum concentrations, because to hold otherwise would allow any formulation-no \nmatter how obvious-to become patentable merely by testing and claiming an \ninherent property.\" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). A patent \nclaim may be found obvious based on inherent properties only in limited \ncircumstances: \"inherency renders a claimed limitation obvious only if the \nlimitation is necessarily present or is the natural result of the combination of \nelements explicitly disclosed by the prior art.\" Id. at 1191 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nI already found as a matter of fact that the pharmacokinetic properties are \nnot inherent in the obvious combination of using buprenorphine in the Tapolsky \ndevice, because the combination does not include a dosage amount. Additionally, I \nfound there was no motivation to achieve the claimed pharmacokinetic properties \n43 in the prior art. According, Alvogen has failed to establish that claims 4 and 5 of \nthe #866 patent are invalid for nonobviousness. \n3. Obviousness of the #539 Patent \na. Findings of Fact \n1) Content of the Asserted Claims \nThe #539 patent discloses the results of a Belbuca\u00ae clinical trial and teaches \nmethods for treating chronic pain using a two-layer mucoadhesive bioerodable \ndrug delivery device where the backing layer is buffered to a pH of between 4.0 \nand 4.8. Plaintiffs assert claims 9 and 20 of the #539 patent. The backing layer pH \nlimitation is required in both asserted claims. \nClaim 9 covers a method for treating \"moderate to severe chronic low back \npain\" comprising (1) \"administering to the subject twice daily a mucoadhesive \nbioerodable drug delivery device to an oral mucosal surface of the subject\" where \nthe drug delivery device comprises (2) \"a bioerodable mucoadhesive layer \ncomprising an effective amount of buprenorphine disposed in a buffered polymeric \ndiffusion environment,\" (3) \"wherein the polymeric diffusion environment is a \nbuffered environment having a pH of between about 4 and about 6,\" (4) \"a backing \nlayer buffered to a pH between about 4.0 and about 4.8 and that does not include \nan opioid antagonist,\" (5) wherein the total daily dose ofbuprenorphine \nadministered to the subject is effective for treating moderate to severe chronic low \nback pain,\" (6) \"wherein the subject is an opioid-experienced subject,\" and (7) \n44 \"wherein the subject treated experiences mild or moderate common opioid adverse \neffects, or no common opioid adverse effects.\" \nClaim 20 (which depends from claim 1) requires the same elements as claim \n9 except that (1) the method is for treating \"chronic pain\" generally (as opposed to \nlow back pain), (2) the device can be administered \"once or twice\" daily, (3) the \nbioerodable mucoadhesive layer comprises \"about 100 g to 0.9 mg of \nbuprenorphine,\" ( 4) the device provides a steady-state Cmax of plasma \nbuprenorphine concentration in a range of about 0.156 to about 0.364 ng/mL, and \n(5) between 1.5% and 8.5% of subjects experience drug related mild or moderate \nconstipation as a side effect. \n2) Content of the Prior Art \nThe priority date for the #539 patent is December 21, 2011. JTX-0003 at 1. \nAccordingly, all the prior art considered for the #866 and #843 patents is also prior \nart for the #53 9 patent. Additionally, the parent application to the #866 and the \n#843 patents, Vasisht I, is prior art to the #539 patent, because it was published on \nJanuary 23, 2008. DTX-17; D.I. 258 at 8. Vasisht I has the same written \ndescription as the #866 and #843 patents. \nClaims 9 and 20 of the #539 patent require that the backing layer of the \nclaimed device is buffered to a pH range of about 4 to about 4.8. Because the prior \nart does not explicitly teach that the pH of the backing layer is relevant to delivery \n45 of buprenorphine, Alvogen argues that the pH limitation is inherent in V asisht I. \nAlvo gen' s theory is that the backing layer formula disclosed in Vasisht I is so \nsimilar to the backing layer in Belbuca\u00ae that they must have the same pH. D.I. \n258 at 44-45; see also DTX-17 ,r 99 (providing a backing layer formulation). The \npH of the Belbuca\u00ae backing layer is between 4.5 and 4.7. Tr. 576:13-25. \nDr. Michniak-Kohn testified that the Vasisht I backing layer and the \nBelbuca\u00ae backing layer have the same weight percentages for all significant \ningredients after converting the Vasisht I formula to dry weight. Tr. 206:3-207:23, \n209:10-17. In converting to dry weight, Dr. Michniak-Kohn rounded the resulting \nvalues to one or two significant figures. Tr. 283:8-15. Based on the observed \nsimilarity between the formulations and the undisputed fact that Belbuca\u00ae has a \nbacking layer with a pH between 4.0 and 4.8, Dr. Michniak-Kohn testified that \nVasisht I necessarily disclosed a backing layer with a pH between 4.0 and 4.8. Tr. \n206:23-207:23, 209:10-17. Dr. Michniak-Kohn did not perform any laboratory \ntesting to reach her conclusions. Tr. 257:21-23. Nor did Dr. Michniak-Kohn offer \nany substantive testimony about whether her rounding could affect her conclusions \nabout the pH of the backing layer taught in Visisht I. \nBut in a declaration to the Patent Office during prosecution of the #539 \npatent, Dr. Vasisht, one of the inventors of the asserted patents, said that the \nbacking layer disclosed in Vasisht I had been remade and its pH measured. JTX-\n46 006 at 4101 ,I 7.6 Dr. Vasisht represented that the average pH of the Vasisht I \nformulation was 5 .61 and that all the measurements were outside the claimed range \nof the #539 patent. JTX-006 at 4101 ,r 7.7 \nGiven two incompatible representations in the record, Dr. Michniak-Kohn's \ntestimony is not sufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Vasisht I \nteaches a backing layer with the same pH as the backing layer ofBelbuca\u00ae. \n3) Secondary Considerations \nBDSI offered additional evidence of two secondary considerations for the \n#539 patent: long-felt need and unexpected results. I find that adjusting the pH of \nthe backing layer produced unexpected results. \n6 Alvogen brought in JTX-006 during direct examination of their expert Dr. \nMichniak-Kohn without any limitation on the purpose for which it was admitted. \nTr. 210:5-211:22. As a statement made by the opposing party's agent, the \ndeclaration of Dr. Vasisht is not hearsay. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). \n7 Alvogen challenges the veracity of Dr. Vasisht's declaration. D.I. 258 at 46. To \nthe extent that Defendants are suggesting inequitable conduct by Dr. Vasisht, this \nargument was struck. Hr'g, June 8, 2021. To the extent that Alvogen seeks to \nchallenge the credibility of Dr. Vasisht's declaration, the only relevant evidence is \nDr. Michniak-Kohn's testimony that the result reported in Dr. Vasisht's declaration \n\"doesn't make sense\" because it reaches a different result than her analysis. Tr. \n211 :22. But it is also possible that the discrepancy is a result of the fact the data \nrelied on by Dr. Michniak-Kohn did not possess enough significant figures to \nallow an accurate comparison between the Visisht I and the Belbuca\u00ae \nformulations. \n47 a) Long-Felt, Unmet Need \nThe #539 patent was filed in 2012. BDSI presented evidence suggesting that \nas of 2012 there was need for an buprenorphine product that did not cause QT \nprolongation at higher doses, Tr. 552:14-17, 916:2-11, and that was not a patch, \n765:21-766:2, 895:3-5. But there was no evidence presented at trial showing \nthese needs were long felt, because no evidence established when artisans \nrecognized the problems the #539 patent may help solve. Accordingly, I find \nconsideration of long-felt need is not probative in determining the obviousness of \nthe #539 patent. \nb) Unexpected Results \nI find that the effects on bioavailability from changing the backing layer's \npH were unexpected. Lowering the pH of the backing layer resulted in an increase \nin the bioavailability ofbuprenorphine. Tr. 804:2-806:19; JTX-353 at 26, PTX-\n608 at 56, DTX-019 at 30, PTX-325 at 29.8 At trial Dr. Taft testified that this \nresult were unexpected. Tr. 804:2-806:19. Additionally, no prior art taught that \nadjusting the pH of the backing layer would affect bioavailability. Dr. Michniak\u00ad\nKohn testified that an artisan of ordinary skill would expect changing the pH of the \nbacking layer to generally impact the properties of the device but did not testify \n8 These references were admitted only for the purpose of establishing that changing \nthe pH of the backing layer produced unexpected results. Tr. 806:20-7. \n48 that an artisan of ordinary skill would have expected adjusting pH to effect \nbioavailability. Tr. 225:25-9; see also DTX-179 ,r 134 (teaching that a backing \nlayer's pH could impact drug degradation). The surprising effect of the backing \nlayer's pH on the bioavailability of a drug in the mucoadhesive layer suggests that \nan artisan of ordinary skill would not have been motivated to buffer the backing \nlayer to the claimed range. \nb. Conclusions of Law \nI already found that as a matter of fact Alvo gen has not shown by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the backing layer pH limitations of the #539 patent are \ninherent in Vasisht I. Because Alvogen has not argued that any other reference \nteaches buffering the backing layer to a pH of about 4.0 to about 4.8, Alvogen has \nnot shown that an artisan of ordinary skill would have been motivated to achieve \nthis result. Alvogen, therefore, has not shown that the claims are obvious. This \nresult is supported by the secondary consideration of unexpected results. Thus, \nAlvogen has not met its burden to prove that either claim 9 or claim 20 of the #539 \npatent is invalid for obviousness. \nB. ANTICPATION \nAlvogen argues that claims 3, 4, 5, and 10 of the #866 patent and claims 8 \nand 20 of the #843 patent are anticipated by a parent application, U.S. patent \napplication 11/Bl 7,915 (the #915 application, DTX-206). Alvogen's position is \n49 that these claims are not entitled to the priority date of the #915 application, \nbecause the #915 application does not disclose the specific pH ranges claimed in \nthe #866 and #843 patents, i.e. the pH ranges of about 4-6, about 4.5-5.5, and \nabout 4.5-5. The parties do not dispute that if the #866 and #843 patents cannot \nclaim priority to the #915 application the relevant claims are anticipated.9 \n1. Findings of Fact \nThe #915 application, discloses the pH of certain embodiments in the \nfollowing paragraph: \nIn one embodiment, e.g., when the medicament is \nbuprenorphine, the pH of the mucoadhesive polymeric \ndiffusion environment in the devices of the present \ninvention is between about 4.0 and about 7.5. In another \nembodiment, the pH of the mucoadhesive polymeric \n9 Patents are entitled to the priority date of an earlier-filed application, only if the \nearlier-filed application contains adequate written description to support the \nsubsequent claims. Hologic, Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 884 F.3d 1357, 1361 \n(Fed. Cir. 2018). The \"hallmark\" of an adequate written description is \n\"disclosure.\" Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 598 F.3d 1336, 1351 (Fed. \nCir. 2010) ( en bane). A written description is adequate to support a subsequent \nfiling if the original application \"reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that \nthe inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter\" as of the earlier filing \ndate. Id. An applicant establishes it was in possession of the invention \"by \ndescribing the invention[] with all its claimed limitations.\" Lockwood v. Am. \nAirlines, Inc., 107 F.3d 1565, 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (emphasis omitted). This \ndescription can be made using \"words, structures, figures, diagrams, formulas, \netc.\" Id. A patentee can also \"rely on information that is 'well-known in the art' to \nsatisfy written description.\" Streck, Inc. v. Research & Diagn,ostic Sys., Inc., 665 \nF.3d 1269, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). The adequacy of a written \ndescription, including for determining priority, is a question of fact. Hologic, 884 \nF.3d at 1361. \n50 diffusion environment is about 6.0. In one embodiment, \nthe pH of the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion \nenvironment is about 5.5 to about 6.5, or between about \n6.0 and 6.5. In yet another embodiment, the pH of the \nmucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment is about \n7 .25. In another embodiment, the pH is between about 7. 0 \nand 7.5, or between about 7.25 and 7.5. In other \nembodiments, the pH of the device may be about 4.0, 4.5, \n5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5, or any incremental value \nthereof. It is to be understood that all values and ranges \nbetween these values and ranges are meant to be \nencompassed by the present invention. \nDTX-206 ,r 63. It is undisputed that this paragraph discloses at least the following \npH values or ranges for the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment: ( 1) \nbetween about 4.0 and about 7.5, (2) about 6.0, (3) between about 5.5 and about \n6.5, (4) between about 6.0 and 6.5, (5) about 7.25, (6) between about 7.0 and 7.5, \nand (7) between about 7 .25 and 7 .5. \nThe parties dispute the meaning of \"the device\" in the sentence \"the pH of \nthe device may be about 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5 and any incremental \nvalue thereof.\" DTX-206 ,r 63 ( emphasis added). At trial there was competing \ntestimony about how an artisan of ordinary skill would have understood this \nsentence. Dr. Michniak-Kohn testified that an artisan of ordinary skill would have \nunderstood the listed pH values as characterizing the entire device. Tr. 235:17-22. \nDr. Williams testified that an artisan of ordinary skill would have understood the \nlisted pH values to refer specifically to the pH of the \"polymeric diffusion \nenvironment.\" Tr. 661:1-3. I find Dr. Williams's testimony on this point more \n51 credible. The #915 application only discusses the pH of the mucoadhesive layer, \nand there is no discussion of the pH of the device as a whole, except for, perhaps, \nin this one disputed sentence. Tr. 661: 13-23. The surrounding paragraphs all \nconcern the mucoadhesive layer and confirm that the quoted paragraph must also \npertain to the properties of the mucoadhesive layer. DTX-206 ,r,r 62, 64-67. \nThe #915 application would have allowed an artisan of ordinary skill to \n\"immediately discern\" that the inventors possessed the pH ranges taught in the \nasserted claims. See Gen. Hosp. Corp. v. Sienna Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., 888 \nF.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (\"[W]here a specification discloses a broad range \nof values and a value within that range is claimed, the disclosure must allow one \nskilled in the art to immediately discern the limitation at issue in the claims.\" \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The #915 application discloses a \npH range for the mucoadhesive layer of about 4.0 to about 7.5, which includes the \npH ranges in the relevant asserted claims. An artisan of ordinary skill would have \nunderstood that the broader range in Vasisht I describes every smaller sub-range as \nwell, because the #915 application explicitly tells the reader \"all values and ranges \nbetween these values and ranges are meant to be encompassed by the present \ninvention.\" The plural \"values and ranges\" cannot only refer to the immediately \nprior sentence---which does not teach any ranges-but must also refer to the \nnumerous pH ranges listed earlier in the paragraph. \n52 Alternatively, the claimed ranges are also disclosed by the sentence \"In other \nembodiments, the pH of the device may be about 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or \n7.5 and any incremental value thereof.\" As I explained, I believe Dr. Williams was \ncredible when he explained that an artisan of ordinary skill would understand this \nsentence to refer to the pH of the mucoadhesive layer. Because the representation \nthat \"all values and ranges between these values and ranges are meant to be \nencompassed by the present invention\" undoubtably covers the immediately \npreceding sentence, the #915 patent teaches the pH ranges of the relevant claims. \n2. Conclusions of Law \nBecause Alvogen has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that the \n#915 application's written description is inadequate to support the #866 and #843 \npatents, those two subsequent patents can claim priority to the #915 application. It \nfollows that the #915 patent cannot anticipate the claims in the #866 and #843 \npatents. Therefore, the asserted claims of those patents are not anticipated. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, I find that the asserted claims 4 and 5 of the #866 \npatent and 9 and 20 of the #529 patent are not invalid and that Alvogen infringes \nthese asserted claims. I further find that asserted claims 3 and 10 of the #866 \npatent and 8, 9, and 20 of the #843 patent are invalid under\u00a7 103. \nThe parties will be directed to submit a proposed order by which the Court \n53 may enter final judgment consistent with this Opinion. \n54 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nBIODELIVERY SCIENCES \nINTERNATIONAL, INC. and \nARIUS TWO, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nAL VOGEN PB RESEARCH & \nDEVELOPMENTLLC,ALVOEN \nALTA OPERATIONS LTD., \nAL VOGEN PINE BROOK LLC, \nAL VOGEN, INC., and AL VOGEN \nGROUP, INC., \nDefendant.
