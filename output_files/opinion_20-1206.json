Presently \nbefore the Court is Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (the \u201cMotion\u201d).  (D.I. 24)  For the reasons set out below, the Court GRANTS \nthe Motion. I.  BACKGROUND A.  Factual Background \nPlaintiff is a  resident of Delaware who worked for over 27 years as a plumber/pipefitter \nfor various companies that  contracted to perform work at the Delaware Refinery  (the \n\u201cRefinery\u201d) .  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 1; D.I. 32 at B020 (the \u201cHitchens Declaration\u201d) , at \u00b6 2)\n1  The Plumbe rs \nand Pipefitters Local Union No. 74 Pension Fund (the \u201cPlan\u201d) is a  multi-employer pension \nbenefit plan as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, et seq.   (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 3; D.I. 23 at AR10100)  The Plan provides pension benefits to \nretirees who :  (1) worked for employers who had collective bargaining agreements with \nPlumbers and Pipefitters Local Union No. 74 (the \u201cUnion\u201d) ; and (2) meet the Plan\u2019s eligibility \n \n1  While Defendant objects to the Hitchens Declaration (an issue discussed in \nfurther detail below), it does so only as  to paragraphs 4-7 and 10 thereof.  (D.I. 39 at 2)  And so \nin the Background section of this opinion, the Court will at times cite to other paragraphs from  \nthat declaration.   \n \nAdditionally, the Court will occasionally cite to a portion of Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint in this \nopinion, but it will only do so for clarity \u2019s sake and when making reference to factual matters \nthat are not in any real dispute.   \n3 criteria for benefits.  ( D.I. 1 at \u00b6  3)  Defendant  administer s the Plan .  (Id. at \u00b6 4)  Plaintiff was a \nparticipant in the Plan.  ( Id. at \u00b6  2)   \nUnder the Plan, retirees receive monthly pension payments for the life of the participant \nand his or her spouse , as appropriate.  ( D.I. 23 at AR10044- 45)  A Plan participant may \ncommence receiving full retirement benefits upon reaching the Normal Retirement Date  (i.e., the \nlast day of the month in which the participant attains the later of :  (a) age 65; or (b) five years of \nparticipating in the Plan ).  (Id. at AR10013- 14)  An eli gible participant may elect a reduced \n\u201cEarly Retirement\u201d benefit upon attaining the earlier of :  (a) age 60 with 10 years of service;  or \n(b) 25 years of service, irre spective of age.   (Id. at AR10010- 11)  Finally, a participant is eligible \nfor \u201cUnreduced Early\u201d retirement pension benefits if  he or she :  (a) has achieved 30 years of \nservice; or (b) is  age 55 with 25 years of service; or (c) is age 62 with ten years of s ervice.  ( Id. at \nAR10031)   \nThe Plan provides that pension benefits can be suspended for p articipants who retire prior \nto normal retirement age  but who nevertheless work after retirement ; this will occur if the \nparticipant is employed in \u201cDisqualifying Employment [.]\u201d  (Id. at AR10065)  \u201cDisqualifying \nEmployment\u201d is  defined in Section 7.01( e) of the Plan  as follows:   \n7.01(e)  \u201cDisqualifying Employment\u201d is employment (including \nself-employment) for any length of time, with any employer, \nincluding, but not limited to, construction managers, general contractors, contractors, subcontractors and/or any other business entity whose business performs work (including subcontracted work):  \n (1) in the plumbing and pipefitting industry; and  \n  \n(2) that comes within the work jurisdiction of the Union, the United Association or within the work jurisdiction of any union or Pension Fund with which this Plan maintains a reciprocal agreement, whether or not such employer is a 4 party to a collective bargain ing agreement with any labor \norganization; provided, however that a non- bargaining unit \nposition with a Contributing Employer shall not be \nDisqualifying Employment within the meaning of this provision and provided, further, that employment in a sales or sa les assistant position for a building supply retailer or \nwholesaler (e.g., Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s) shall not be considered as disqualifying employment; and  \n (3) in addition to, and not in limitation of, the provisions set forth in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above, work for an \nemployer, including but not limited to construction managers, general contractors, contractors and any other form of business entity, shall be disqualifying employment within the meaning of this provision if the employer, in any manner, directly or indirectly, engages in or contracts for the supervision of work in the plumbing and pipefitting industry, even where the actual work will be subcontracted to other companies or business entities.  \n (Id. at AR10064)  \nIn 2008, Plaintiff received a nd accepted an offer to work as a Maintenance Supervisor for \nthe maintenance department at the Refinery.\n2  (Hitchens Declaration  at \u00b6 3)  Plaintiff could not \nbe a Union member and hold this position, and so in accepting the position, P laintiff withdr ew \nfrom the Union.  ( See D.I. 1 at  \u00b6 35; see also  D.I. 34 at 3)    \nOn April 30, 2019, Plaintiff filed an application with the Uni on for early pension \nbenefits.  ( D.I. 23 at AR00001)   In the \u201cWorking After Retirement Employment Inquiry\u201d portion \nof this application, Plaintiff checked  the box indicating that he would be working after he retires .  \n(Id. at AR00011)  This portion of the application went on to ask:  \u201cIs this a non- bargaining \nposition? \u201d (i.e., a non- union position).  ( Id.; see also  Tr. at 50)  Instead of checking the provided \n \n2  The Refinery has been owned by different companies during Plaintiff\u2019s \nemployment  there, \u201c most recently Valero, which was later sold to PBF Energy.\u201d   (Hitchens \nDeclaration at \u00b6  2) 5 \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d boxes in response to this question, Plaintiff wrote the following answer by hand:  \n\u201cIf I do, [i]t will not be mech. pipefitting/plumbing[.]\u201d  (D.I. 23 at AR00011)    \nOn June 3, 2019, Defendant \u2019s members held a meeting during which they discussed \nPlaintiff\u2019s application for benefits .  (Id. at AR00016- 17)  Then, by letter dated July 29, 2019 (the \n\u201cJuly 29 letter\u201d) , the Plan\u2019s third -party administrator  Zenith American Solutions  (the \n\u201cAdministrator\u201d)  informed Plaintiff that his pension benefits had been suspended (and that this  \nsuspension would be treated as a \u201cdenial of a cl aim for benefits\u201d) because Plaintiff \u201cindicated on \n[his] application that [he] will be working after [he] retire[s], even though [he] did not indicate whether it was in a bargaining position, and indicated that [he] would be doing plumbing and pipefitting work.\u201d  ( Id. at AR00019- 20)  The letter , citing to Section 7.01(e) of the Plan, further \nstated that  an additional reason why Plaintiff\u2019s pension benefits were suspended was that \u201cit has \ncome to the attention of the [] A dministrator that [ Plaintiff was ] working in \u201c\u2018 Disqualifying \nEmployment .\u2019\u201d  (Id. at AR00019)   To the extent that Plaintiff disagreed with the Administrator\u2019s \ndetermination, t he letter directed Plaintiff to , inter alia :  (1) request a review by submitting a \nwritten appeal within 60 days of receipt of the letter ; and (2) submit any \u201cwritten comments, \ndocuments and records that support your c laim\u201d along with any appeal.  ( Id. at AR00020)  \nOn September 11, 2019, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel informed the Administrator that he had been \nretained by Plaintiff in connection with the denial of Plaintiff\u2019s claim for benefits , and requested \nrelevant documents.  ( Id. at AR00037- 38)  In response, on September 26, 2019, Defendant\u2019s \ncounsel provided Plaintiff\u2019s counsel with \u201ca copy of the most recent amended and restated Plan document and amendments, and the Summary Plan Description[,]\u201d  along with a copy of \nPlaintiff \u2019s pension application.  (D.I. 39, ex. 1)   6 On November 1, 2019, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel again wrote to the Administrator , this time  \ndisputing that Plaintiff\u2019s employment as a Maintenance Supervisor constituted \u201c Disqualifying \nEmployment\u201d and requesting reversal of the Administrator\u2019s decision to deny Plaintiff benefits  \n(the \u201cNovember 1 letter\u201d or the \u201cNovember 1, 2019 appeal\u201d ).  (D.I. 23 at AR00040- 41)  \nDefendant\u2019s members treated the November 1 letter as Plaintiff\u2019s appeal of Defendant\u2019s bene fits \ndenial .  (D.I. 25 at 7)   \nDuring a December 2, 2019 meeting, Defendant\u2019s members considered and ultimately \ndenied Plaintiff\u2019s appeal.  ( D.I. 23 at AR00045- 46)  On February 14, 2020, Defendant\u2019s counsel \nsent a letter to Plaintiff , informing him of this  decision  (the \u201cFebruary 14 letter\u201d).  ( Id. at \nAR00050- 51)  The February 14 letter explained that th e decision was made because Plaintiff wa s \nengaged in \u201c Disqualifying E mployment\u201d  as described in Section 7.01(e) , in that, inter alia , \nPlaintiff  was \u201cthe coordinator of plumbing and pipefitting maintenance for two of the units at the \nRefinery, which includes overseeing the plumbing and pipefitting work of his former employer .\u201d  \n(Id.)   \nAdditional relevant facts will be set out as necessary in Section III be low.   \nB.  Procedural Background  \nPlaintiff commenced this action on September 10, 2020.  (D.I. 1)  In his Complaint, \nPlaintiff s ought , inter alia :  (1) a declaration that Defendant violated the terms of the Plan by \nfailing to pay Plaintif f early pension benefits ; (2) an order requiring Defendant to pay Plaintiff \nthe past and future early pension benefits he is due ; and (3) reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs \nhe incurred in bring this action.  ( Id. at \u00b6 53)   \nDefendant filed the instant  Motion on September 17, 2021.  (D.I. 24)  The Motion was \nfully briefed as of November 1, 2021.  (D.I. 39 )   7 On April 4, 2022, the parties filed a joint notice of consent to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to \nconduct all proceedings in this case, including trial, the entry of final judgment and all post -trial \nproceedings.  (D.I. 44)  T he Court then heard argument on the Motion on June 25, 2022.  ( D.I. 50 \n(hereinafter \u201cTr.\u201d))  \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA. Summary Judgment       \nSummary  judgment  is appropriate where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(a) .  The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine \nissue o f material fact.  See  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585 \nn.10 (1986) .  If the moving party has sufficiently demonstrated the absence of such a dispute, t he \nnonmovant must then \u201ccome forw ard with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.\u201d  Id.  at 587 (internal quotation marks, citation and emphasis omitted).  If the nonmoving \nparty fails to make a sufficient showing in this regard, then the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 322- 23 (1986) .  During this \nprocess, the Court will \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving par ty, and it \nmay not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\u201d   Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing \nProds., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000) .\n3 \n \n3  Defendant argues that the non -moving party is not entitled to the usual summary \njudgment -type inferences in ERISA cases.  (D.I. 25 at 8)  However, the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit applies the usual summary judgment standard in such  cases.  \nPatrick v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 527 F. Supp. 3d 689, 697 n.2 (D. Del. 2021)  (citing \ncases); see also (D.I. 34 at 6).  In any event, a s the Court will discuss below, here there are no \ngenuine disputes of material fact  at play .   8 However, in order to defeat a motion for summary  judgment , the nonmoving party must \n\u201cdo more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d  \nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 586.  The \u201cmere existence of some  alleged factual \ndispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary  \njudgment ; the requirement is that there be no genuine  issue of material  fact.\u201d  Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247- 48 (1986)  (emphasis in original).  Facts that could alter \nthe outcome are \u201cmaterial,\u201d and a factual dispute is \u201cgenuine,\u201d only where \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonabl e jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d   Id. at 248.  \u201cIf the \nevidence is merely colorable . . . or is not significantly probative  . . . summary  judgment  may be \ngranted.\u201d   Id. at 249- 50 (internal citations omitted).  \nA party asserting that a fact cannot be\u2014or, alternatively, asserting that a fact is \u2014\ngenuinely disputed must support the assertion either by \u201c citing to particular parts of materials in \nthe record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials ;\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do not \nestablish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce \nadmissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B) . \nB. ERISA \nERISA permits a plan participant to bring a civil action in federal c ourt to recover \nbenefits due under the terms of a benefit plan.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).  Where, as here,  the \nplan documents at issue grant  the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility \nfor benefits , courts review a denial of benefits under an arbitrary and capricious standard.  Miller \nv. Am. Airlines, Inc., 632 F.3d 837, 844 (3d Cir. 2011) ; Patrick v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. 9 Co., 527 F. Supp. 3d 689, 697 (D. Del. 2021) .4  This is a \u201cdeferential standard of review[,]\u201d \nFleisher v. Standard Ins. Co., 679 F.3d 116, 120 (3d Cir. 2012)  (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted), under which a reviewing court may overturn an administrator\u2019s decision if it is \n\u201cwithout reason, unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous a s a matter of law [,]\u201d Miller , \n632 F.3d at 845 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).5  Accordingly, a court must \n\u201cdefer to an administrator\u2019s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous plan language, but an \nadministrator\u2019s interpretation may not conflict with the plain language of the plan.\u201d  Patterson v. \nAetna Life Ins. Co., 763 F. App\u2019x 268, 270- 71 (3d Cir. 2019) ; see a lso Duda v. Standard Ins. \nCo., 649 F. App\u2019x 230, 234 (3d Cir. 2016) (noting that the court must \u201cdetermine whether there \nwas a reasonable basis for the administrator\u2019s decision, based on the facts known at the time the \ndecision was made\u201d).   \nIII.  DISCUSSION  \nWith its Motion, Defendant asserts that its decision to deny Plaintiff\u2019s early pension \nbenefits in light of Plaintiff\u2019s \u201c Disqualifying E mployment\u201d was not arbitrary and capricious.  \n \n4  There is no dispute in this case that the Plan documents provide Defendant with \nbroad discretion over the Plan\u2019s administration.  (D.I. 25 at 9- 10; see also D.I. 34 at 2; Tr. at 91)  \n \n5  This standard is also sometimes described as an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d  standard,  \nand in the ERISA context, the \u201c arbitrary and capricious \u201d and \u201c abuse of discretion\u201d  standards of \nreview are \u201cessentially identical.\u201d  Miller , 632 F.3d at 845 n.2.  The Third Cir cuit has explained \nthat there are two reasons why this deferential standard of review is applied when the plan \ndocument gives the administrator discretionary authority.  First, this gives effect to the plan -\ndrafter\u2019s intentions , which is appropriate, in that ERISA abounds with the language and \nterminology of trust law \u2014and the hallmark purpose of trust law is to accomplish the settlor\u2019s \nintentions .  Dowling v. Pension Plan for Salaried Emps. of Union Pac. Corp. & Affiliates , 871 \nF.3d 239, 246 (3d Cir. 2017).  Second, Congress  intended to encourage employers to offer \nERISA plans ; giving deference to the decisions of plan administrators promotes efficiency, \npredictability and uniformity in the ERISA administration context, which in turn encourages employers to make ERISA  plans  available in the first place .  Id.  10 (D.I. 25 at 2)  Thus, according to Defendant, there are no triable genuine is sues of material fact \nand Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s claim.  ( Id. at \n3) \nPlaintiff, for his  part, retorts that Defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u201c Disqualifying \nEmployment\u201d is without logic  or reason.  (D.I. 34 at 11-14)  It also contends that Defendant\u2019s \nprocedural handling of Plaintiff\u2019s appeal amounts to arbitrary and capricious conduct.  ( Id. at 7-\n11, 15- 22)  The Court will take up these arguments in turn below.  \nA. Defendant\u2019s Determination that Plaintiff\u2019s Employment was \u201cDisq ualifying \nEmployment\u201d  \n \nThe Court finds that Defendant\u2019s  determination that Plaintiff\u2019s employment constituted  \n\u201cDisqualifying E mployment\u201d was not arbitrary and capricious.   In reaching this conclusion, the \nCourt will first ex plain why Defendant\u2019s interpretation of how Section 7.01(e)\u2019s subsections \nwork together to define \u201c Disqualifying E mployment\u201d  is supported by the plain language of the \nPlan.  The Court will then explain why the administrative record supports Defendant\u2019s \nconclusion that Plaintiff was , in fact, engaged in \u201cDisqualifying E mployment \u201d under the \nmeaning given that term in Section  7.01(e)(3).   \n1.  How Section 7.01(e)\u2019s Subsections Relate to Each Other with Regard \nto the Definition of \u201cDisqualifying Employment\u201d  \n As an initial matter, the parties dispute whether the requirements of Section 7.01(e)(1), \nSection 7.01(e)(2) and Section 7.01(e)(3) must all  be satisfied in order for a position to count as \n\u201cDisqualifying Employment.\u201d  In his  briefing, Plaintiff argues that because the word \u201cand\u201d \ncomes at the end of S ections 7.01(e)(1) and 7.01(e)(2), then employment must meet the \nrequirements found in all three subs ections (i.e., 7.01(e)(1), 7.01(e)(2) and 7.01(e)(3) ) in order to \nconstitute \u201c Disqualifying E mployment .\u201d  (Id. at 11 -12, 14)   Meanwhile, Defendant contends that 11 if employment meets  the requirements described in 7.01(e)(3) , then that  is enough to constitute \n\u201cDisqualifying Employment .\u201d  (D.I. 25 at 13)  In other words, according to Defendant, S ection \n7.01(e)(3) spells out a separate basis for a finding of \u201c Disqualifying Employment \u201d\u2014one  that is  \nindependent of S ections 7.01(e)(1) and 7.01(e)(2)  and that, if satisfied, ends the inquiry.  ( Id.; Tr. \nat 25, 29- 32, 62)    \nTo be sure, Section 7.01(e) is not artfully drafted.  (Tr. at 30, 43, 86)  And when a term is \ndefined in  multiple contractual subsections , with each of those subsections being joined together \nby the word \u201cand,\u201d  then one might initially think tha t the section as a whole should be read in the \nconjunctive.  ( Id. at 85 -86); see also, e.g., Stolte  v. Securian Life  Ins. Co., Case No. 21- cv-07735-\nDMR, 2022 WL 3357839, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 2022)  (\u201cThe [eligibility] requirements [ for \ngroup life insurance coverage] are written in the conjunctive , meaning that all four elements \nmust be satisfied to establish eligibility. \u201d).  But here,  as Defendant argues, any such initial \npresumption is quickly set aside after reading the actual word ing of  Section 7.01(e)(3) .  Section \n7.01(e)(3) states that \u201cwork for an employer, including but not limited to construction managers, \ngeneral contractors, contractors and any other form of business entity, shall be disqualifying \nemployment within the meaning of this provision\u201d  if certain other conditions set out t herein are \nmet.  (Id. (emphasis added))   In other words , here Section 7.01(e)(3) is  pretty directly  telling the \nreader:  \u201cNo matter what we have said before this  in the prior portions of Section 7.01(e) , if a \nperson\u2019s work for an employer is of the type th at we are about to describe, then that work will \namount to \u2018Disqualifying Employment .\u2019\u201d   \nMoreover, e ven if there was some ambiguity as to whether Defendant\u2019s position was \ncorrect, Defendant would still prevail on this point .  That is because Defendant\u2019s argument about  \nhow the subsections of Section 7.01(e) work together  is at least  a reasonable  one.  Indeed, during 12 oral argument, Plaintiff \u2019s counsel seemed to acknowledge that Section 7.01(e) is  at least \n\u201cambiguous\u201d  with reg ard to whether all three subsections must be satisfied.  (Tr. at 85 ; see also \nid. at 91)   \nDespite this, Plaintiff \u2019s counsel  asserted that  if the Plan language at issue was ambiguous, \nthen the  \u201cstandard rules of [ interpreting ] contract [s]\u201d should apply\u2014whereby any ambiguity \nshould be \u201c construed against \u201d Defendant.  ( Id. at 86 ; see also id . at 91)  Yet  Plaintiff is  incorrect  \non that front .  As noted above, where the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard applies in the \nERISA context (as it does here), a court must \u201cdefer to an administrator\u2019s reasonable \ninterpretation of ambiguous plan language[.]\u201d  Patterson, 763 F. App\u2019x at 270- 71; see also  \nFleisher , 679 F.3d at  123-24 (rejecting the notion that ambiguous terms of an insurance policy \ngoverned by ERISA should be construed against the drafter in accordance with general \nprinciples of contract law, as this would misapprehend the nature of an abuse of discretion \nstandard of review , whereby deference is given to an administrator\u2019s reasonable interpretation of \nan ambiguous term).  Defendant\u2019s interpretation of S ection 7.01(e)(3) as being a stand -alone \nbasis for demonstrating \u201cDisqualifying Employment\u201d is , at a minimum, not unreasonable .  \nTherefore , the Court must de fer to this interpretation.  (Tr. at 24); Dowling v. Pension Plan for \nSalaried Emps. of Union Pac. Corp. & Affiliates , 871 F.3d 239, 248 (3d Cir. 2017) (\u201c[W]hen \ngranting deference we do not demand the best  interpretation, only a reasonable one [.]\u201d) \n(emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).    \n2.  Whether Substantial E vidence Supports Defendant\u2019s Conclusion that \nPlaintiff Participated in \u201cDisqualifying Employment\u201d  \n \nHaving now determined that Defendant\u2019s interpretation of how S ection 7.01(e)(3)  works \n(i.e., that it provides for an independent definition of \u201c Disqualifying Employment \u201d) is at least 13 reasonable, the Court  next consider s whether substantial evidence supports Defendant\u2019s \nconclusion that Plaintiff\u2019s employment actually  met this definition.  As noted above, Section \n7.01(e)(3)  provides that \u201c Disqualifying Employment \u201d occurs when a plan participant \u201cwork[s] \nfor an employer , including but not limited to construction managers, general contractors, \ncontractors and any other form of business entity . . . if the employer, in any manner, directly or \nindirectly, engages in or contracts for the supervision of work in the plumbing and pipefitting industry , even where the actual work will be subcontracted to other companies or business \nentities.\u201d  ( D.I. 23 at AR10064 (emphasis added) )   \nFrom there, Defendant\u2019s analysis is pretty straightforward.  (D.I. 25 at 13- 14)  It i s \nundisputed that Plaintiff was a supervisor at the R efinery .  (Id. at 13; D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 15- 28; D.I. 39 \nat 8 n.5)  And it is also undisputed that in this position, Plaintiff \u2014at some level \u2014supervised \nplumbers and pipefitters  who worked at the Refinery.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 25, ex. 1 (\u201cHackendorn \nDecl.\u201d) at \u00b6\u00b6 4-9; D.I. 34 at 14; Tr. at 4 -5, 35; see also  D.I. 1 at \u00b6  29)  Indeed, Michael \nHackendorn, a Trustee of Defendant, notes in a declaration that at all relevant times he \u201cworked [at the Refinery] as a plumber/pipefitter\u201d and that when he did so, he was personally \u201cunder the supervision of Plaintiff[.]\u201d  (Hackendorn Decl . at \u00b6\u00b6 4-9)  Thus, Defendant argues, \u201cthe record in \nthis matter shows that Plaintiff supervised work in the plumbing and pipefitting industry [and so] Plaintiff has engaged in Disqualifying E mployment[.]\u201d  (D.I. 25 at 13- 14; see also  Tr. at 9 )    \nPlaintif f\u2019s main argument in response is that his  employment still does not satisfy Section \n7.01(e)(3)\u2019s definition of \u201c Disqualifying Employment \u201d because Plaintiff (and thus, his employer)  \ndid not directly  supervise plumbers and  pipefitters  at the Refinery .  (D.I . 34 at 14; Tr. at 87- 88)  \nIn support, Plaintiff submitted  his own declaration  and a declaration of his  supervisor at the \nRefinery, Michael Mattera.  ( Hitchens Declaration ; D.I. 38 -1)  In these declarations, Plaintiff and 14 Mr. Mattera state that as a Maintenance Supervisor, Plaintiff was not permitted to \u201c deal directly \u201d \nwith any plumbers or pipefitters ; instead, if there was an issue with a plumber\u2019s or a pipefitter\u2019s \nwork at the Refinery, Plaintiff would raise that issue with the Refinery\u2019s Constructi on Manager, \nNooter Construction (\u201cNooter\u201d) .  (Hitchens Declaration at \u00b6\u00b6 6- 7; D.I. 38- 1 at \u00b6  6)  Plaintiff and \nMr. Mattera also state that Plaintiff  himself never did any physical plumbing or pipefitting work, \n(Hitchens Declaration at \u00b6  7; D.I. 38- 1 at \u00b6 \u00b6 5, 8) , and that Plaintiff only interacted with a  \ncraftsm an\u2019s job performance with respect to \u201cmatters of safety[ ,]\u201d (D.I. 38 -1 at \u00b6  6).  In light of \nthis, Plaintiff argues that the requirements of Section 7.01(e)(3) are not satisfied.  (Tr. at 86 -90; \nsee also D.I. 34 at 5, 14)  \nIn assessing this argument, the Court must first address an introductory matter :  \nDefendant\u2019s contention that  Plaintiff \u2019s declaration and Mr. Mattera\u2019s declaration should be \ndisregarded , in light of the appropriate standard of review .  (D.I. 39 at 1- 2 & n.2; Tr. at 9 -10)  \nMore specifically, Defendant argues that:  (1) p ursuant to the arbitrary and capricious standard, \nthe Court must review the administrator\u2019s decision \u201cusing only the evidence available to\u201d the \nadministrator at the time that it made the decision , Patrick  v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., \nCivil Action No. 15- 169-SLR-SRF, 2016 WL 4573877, at *7 (D. Del. Aug. 31, 2016) , report \nand recommendation adopted by  2016 WL 5662138 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2016) ; see also Johnson \nv. UMWA Health & Ret. Funds , 125 F. App\u2019x 400, 405 (3d Cir. 2005) (\u201c This Court has made \nclear that the record for arbitrary and capricious review of ERISA benefits denial is the record made before the plan administrator which cannot be supplemented during lit igation.\u201d) (emphasis \nadded) ; and (2) the cited information in Plaintiff\u2019s and Mr. Mattera\u2019s declarations were not, in \nfact, before the Administrator at the time it made the relevant benefit denial decision s, (D.I. 39 at \n1). 15 Defendant is correct .  What Plai ntiff and Mr. Mattera assert in their declarations \u2014i.e., \nalleged facts describing the particular responsibilities that Plaintiff did or did not have vis -\u00e0-vis \nthe work of the Refinery\u2019s plumbers and pipefitters \u2014was not information available to  the \nAdministrator when it made the decisions at issue  in 2019 and 2020.  Thus, it would not be \nappropriate for the Court to consider those facts here.6   \nHowever, the Court notes that even if it could consider these two d eclarations, the \nultimate outcome would be the same.  ( See Tr. at 9 -10, 35- 37)  That is because the plain \nlanguage of Section 7.01(e)(3) is very broad .  The subsection encompass es work for an employer \nif the employer \u201cin any manner , directly or indirectly , engages in . . . the supe rvision of work in \nthe plumbing and pipefitting industry, even where the actual work will be subcontracted to other \ncompanies or business entities.\u201d  ( D.I. 23 at AR10064 (emphasis added))   While Plaintiff seems \nto focus on the fact that he did not directly  supervise plumbers and pipefitters, (D.I. 34 at 5, 14; \nTr. at 88- 90), the language of Section 7.01(e)(3) is not limited to direct  supervision.  I ndeed, it \nexpressly includes  indirect  supervision.  And it is clear \u2014even from Plaintiff\u2019s own Complaint \nand declarations \u2014that Plaintiff  worked for an employer (the Refinery) that  was, at minimum, \n \n6  It is true that along with its briefing, Defendant submitted a declaration of its own:  \nMr. Hackendorn \u2019s declaration .  (D.I. 25, ex. 1)  But i n his briefing, Plaintiff did not argue that \nMr. Hackendorn\u2019s d eclaration  should be disregarded because it contains facts that were \nunavailable at the time of Defendant\u2019s decision .  (See D.I. 34)  ( Plaintiff instead wr ongly argues \nthat Mr. Hackendorn\u2019s d eclaration \u201cis bereft of any facts\u201d and contains only conclusions.).  (Tr. \nat 67)  And i n contrast  to the declarations submitted by Plaintiff , Mr. Hackendorn\u2019s declaration \ndescribes the information that Defendant actually considered  when  deciding to  deny Plaintiff\u2019s \nearly pension benefits.  ( See D.I. 25, ex. 1 at \u00b6 11 (\u201cI advised the Trustees that I was personally \naware that Plaintiff was working in the plumbing and pipefitting industry and supervising \nplumbers and pipefitters performing work at the Refinery[.]\u201d) ; D.I. 34 at 4- 5 (Plaintiff no ting that \nat the December 2, 2019 Board meeting, Mr. Hackendorn described his personal observations to the Board ); Tr. at 9 , 67)  Thus, consideration of Mr. Hackendorn\u2019s declaration does not run afoul \nof the  requirements of the relevant standard of review .   \n 16 indirectly engaged in the supervision of the work of plumbers and pipefitters.  In deed, Plaintiff \nexplains how he himself  engaged in that very type of indirect supervision on the Refinery\u2019s \nbehalf .  He  was required to be aware of how the plumbers and  pipefitters did their work at the \nRefinery .  And if there was a problem or concern with that work , then he would address the issue \nwith Nooter (th e entity that he says directly managed the plumbers and pipefitters).7   \nThus, there is substantial evidence to support Defendant\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiff\u2019s  \nemployment was \u201c Disqualifying Employment \u201d pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(3).  For t hese \nreasons, Defendant\u2019s determination  to suspend Plaintiff\u2019s pension benefits on this ground was \nnot arbitrary or capricious.8  See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Local 553 Pension Fund, 16 Civ. 8893 (LGS), \n \n7  In his briefing, Plaintiff also appears to be making a second argument as to why \nhis employment did  not satisfy the definition of \u201cDisqualifying Employment\u201d set out in Section \n7.01(e)(3) :  that even if Plaintiff\u2019s employer does supervise the work of plumbers and pipefitters, \nthat supervision is not \u201cof work in the plumbing and pipefitting industry\u201d since the Refinery is in \nthe oil refining industry, not the plumbing or pipefitting industry.  (D.I. 34 at 13)   In Plaintiff\u2019s \nview, \u201cwork in the  plumbing and pipefitting industry\u201d  means  work for a company \u201c[w]hose . . . \nreason for being in existence\u201d is to perform plumbing and pipefitting work.  (Tr. at 82)    \n This additional argument does not change the outcome.  On the one hand, Plaintiff\u2019s \ninterpretation (i.e., that Section 7.01(e)(3) must refer to supervision of work performed by a company whose sole reason for exist ence is to  do plumbing and pipefitting work\u2014e.g., a \nplumbing company) could indeed be a reasonable one.  But on the other hand, i t strikes the Court \nas also reasonable that Section 7.01(e) \u2019s drafters  intended that employment for a comp any that \nsupervis es plumbers and pipefitters \u2014even if th e company\u2019s  central focus was on a different \nbusiness endeavor ( e.g., refining oil) \u2014should be covered .  In other words, it seems reasonable \nthat Defendant and the Union might not have wanted former union members to receive early retirement benefits if the ir company s upervised plumber s or pipefitter s, as a company that \nengaged in that work could potentially \u201ctak [e] jobs away from union people\u201d or have \u201ca direct \nimpact on union work[.]\u201d   (Tr. at 32 -34)  And so long as Defendant\u2019s interpretation is \nreasonable, it cannot be arbitrary and capricious.   \n8  Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff\u2019s employment constituted \u201cD isqualifying \nEmployment \u201d pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(1).  (D.I. 25 at 11)  Plaintiff disagrees.  (D.I. 34 at 12)  \nThe Court need not address this issue, however, in light of its conclusion that Section 7.01(e)(3) provides a stand- alone definition of \u201c Disqualifying E mployment\u201d that encompassed Plaintiff\u2019s \nwork.       \n 17 2017 WL 3242329, at *4 -5 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 2017)  (finding that the d efendant\u2019s determination \nthat the p laintiff was engaged in disqualifying employment was supported by the facts and \nevidence, including by the plaintiff\u2019s own statements, and that plaintiff\u2019s argument to the \ncontrary \u201cflatly contra dict[ed]\u201d the plain language of the plan) ; Lynch  v.

Defendant\u2019s Procedural Handling of Plaintiff\u2019s Appeal  \n \n Next, P laintiff  argues that \u2014separate and apart from whether D efendant \u2019s determination \nthat P laintiff  engaged in \u201cDisqualifying Employment \u201d was reasonable\u2014Defendant\u2019s  procedural  \nhandling of Plaintiff\u2019s appeal amounted to arbitrary and capricious conduct .  (D.I. 34 at 2, 7- 11, \n15-22)  More specifically, Plaintiff contends that Defendant engaged in a number of ERISA -\nrelated procedural violations , when it failed to :  (1) notify Plaintiff of his right to a hearing before \nthe Board ; (2) provide Plaintiff with the facts upon which Defendant\u2019s decision was based; and \n(3) advise P laintiff as to what materials or information would be necessary to perfect his claim.  \n(Id. at 7-11, 15- 22)9   \n \nSimilarly, Defendant contends that Plaintiff\u2019s benefits were also suspended because he \nfailed to properly disclose his employment as Maintenance Supervisor in his application for early pension benefits .  (D.I. 25 at 14- 15)  Plaintiff responds by asserting that this argument should be \ndeemed waived.   (D.I. 34 at 22- 23)  Here again, in light of the Court\u2019s conclusion with respect to \nSection 7.01(e)(3), it is not necessary to address this argument.    \n \n9  In addition to referring to these deficiencies as \u201cprocedural \u201d violations, Plaintiff \nasserts that \u2014at least with respect to Defendant\u2019s failure to notify Plaintiff of his right to a \nhearing \u2014this  constituted a breach of a fiduciary duty that Defendant owed t o Plaintiff .  (D.I. 34 \nat 7-11)  Whether Plaintiff\u2019s allegations here are rightly considered to be ERISA \u201cprocedural \u201d 18  ERISA and corresponding regulations set forth  basic procedural requirements governing \nERISA plans , requiring that every plan must :  \u201c(1) provide adequate notice in writing to any \nparticipant . . . whose claims for benefits  . . . has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons \nfor such denial [;]\u201d and (2) \u201cafford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for \nbenefits has been denied for a full and fair review [.]\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133 (\u201cSection 503\u201d) ; see also \n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503- 1 (the \u201cClaims Procedure Regulation\u201d) ; Miller , 632 F.3d at 850.  A plan \nadministrator\u2019s compliance with Section 503 in deciding to deny benefits is probative of whether \nthe decision was arbitrary and capricious.  Miller , 632 F.3d at 851; see also Becknell v. \nSeverance Pay Plan of Johnson & Johnson & U.S. Affiliated Cos., 644 F. App\u2019x 205, 213 (3d Cir. 2016) (noting that procedural irregularities are factors to consider in determining if the plan administrator\u2019s interpretation was reasonable ).     \nProcedural defects should not upset the determination of a plan administrator if the \nadministrator is in substantial compliance with Section 503.  Morningred v. Delta Family -Care \n& Survivorship Plan, 790 F. Supp. 2d 177, 194 (D. Del. 2011); Russell v. Paul Revere Life Ins. \n \nviolation s, or \u201cbreach es of fiduciary duty\u201d (or both), it is notable that nowhere in the Complaint \ndid Plaintiff explicitly refer to these concepts.  (D.I. 1; Tr. at 94- 96)  And while s ome courts \nseem to conclude that arguments asserting procedural violations by a plan administrator  are \nimplicitly subsumed within a claim for wrongful denial of ERISA benefits , see, e.g. , Greer v. \nOperating Eng\u2019rs Local 324 Pension Fund, Case No. 17- 11832, 2017 WL 3891785, at *3 (E.D. \nMich.

Ohio Nov. 1, 2010) , there are certainly plenty of examples \nof ERISA plaintiffs  making such allegations in  separate, stand -alone counts in a complaint , see, \ne.g., Rol -Hoffman v.

Instead, Defendant addressed t hese arguments on the merits.

A notice of denial of benefits is substantially complaint with ERISA \nregulations if it provides a \u201cstatement of reasons that, under the circumstances of the case, permitted a sufficiently clear understanding of the administrator\u2019s position to permit effective review.\u201d  Morningred, 790 F. Supp. 2d at 194 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) ; \nsee also Potts v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 272 F. Supp. 3d 690, 715 (W.D. Pa. 2017) .\n10   \nHaving set out the relevant law, the Court  will now address each of the three alleged \nprocedural violations cited by Plaintiff.   \n1. Defendant\u2019s Alleged Failure to Notify Plaintiff of His Right to Request \na Hearing  \n \nFirst, Plaintiff asserts that D efendant  improperly  failed to notify him of his right to \nrequest a hearing ; as a result, he argues that he was unable to explain at a hearing hi s \u201crole \nworking for [the Refinery\u2014i.e.,] that he was not permitted to directly  instruct[] or control Union \nmembers, except in emergency safety situations.\u201d  (D.I. 34 at 10- 11 (emphasis added) )  In \nmaking this argument, Plaintiff points out that Section 9.04 of the Plan  requires : \nThis notice [of  denial of benefits] will include a statement that the \nperson whose claim has been denied has a right within sixty (60) \n \n10  Generally, t he remedy for a violation of Section 503 is remanding the action to \nthe plan administrator in order for the claimant to get the benefit of  a full and fair review.  Syed \nv. Hercules Inc. , 214 F.3d 155, 162 (3d Cir. 2000) .   20 days of written notification of claim denial to request a hearing \nbefore the Board of Trustees or a committee thereof for the purpose of  carrying out a full and fair review of the claim denial.  \n \n(D.I. 23 at AR10075 ( cited in  D.I. 34 at 7)) ; see also 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503- 1(h)(2)(iii) (requiring \na Plan to provide  to provide to the claimant \u201call documents, records, and other information \nrelev ant to the claimant\u2019s claim for benefits\u201d)  (cited in D.I. 34 at 8)  (emphasis added) ; 29 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 2560.503- 1(g)(1)(iv) (requiring a notification of benefits determination to include a description \nof the plan\u2019s review procedures) ( cited in D.I. 34 at 10).     \nDefendant\u2019s July 29 letter  (i.e., the letter that first informed Plaintiff of the denial of \nbenefits)  did in fact explicitly refe rence Se ction 9.04 when it stated:  \u201cIf you disagree with this \ndetermination, under Section 9.04 of the Plan (copy attached), you may request a review by \nsubmitting a written appeal to the Board of Trustees, which must be receive d in this office no \nlater than 60 days after you receive this notification.\u201d  ( D.I. 23 at AR00020)  However, the July \n29 letter does not specifically refer to a right to a \u201chearing .\u201d  And though the letter asserted that a \ncopy of the Plan was attached  to it, that was incorrect; Defendant acknowledges that it made a \nmistake and forgot to include the  Plan as an attachment .  (D.I. 39 at 3; Tr. at 52)  Nevertheless, \nDefendant contends that none of these facts provide a basis for relief for Plaintiff because:  (1) \non September 11, 2019, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested Plan documents from Defendant ; (2) \nDefendant\u2019s counsel the reafter  provided Plaintiff with the requested materials  (including Sec tion \n9.04)  on September 26, 2019; and (3) Plaintiff never requested a hearing from  Defendant  \nthereafter .  (D.I. 39 at 3- 5 & n.4; id., ex. 1; see also  D.I. 23 at AR00037- 38; Tr. at 53, 107- 08)   \nThe Court agrees with Defendant.  The July 29 letter\u2019s failure  to notify Plaintiff of the \nright to request a hearing  was undisputedly a procedural defect .  But Defendant otherwise \nsubstantially complied w ith its duty to notify Plaintiff of this right .  (D.I. 39 a t 3-4)   21 After all, the s ubstantial compliance test \u201c considers all communications \u201d between the \nplan participant and administrator , in order to determine whether the information provided was \nsufficient under the circumstances.  Lafleur v. L a. Health Serv. & Indem. Co., 563 F.3d 148, 154 \n(5th Cir. 2009)  (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .  If claim \ncommunications as a whole are sufficient to satisfy the purposes of Section 503, the n the  claim \ndecision should be upheld, even if one particular communicatio n did  not meet Section 503\u2019s \nrequirements .  Kent v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co., 96 F.3d 803, 807 (6th Cir. 1996).  Here, by \nexpressly referencing Section 9.04 in the July 29 letter, Defendant signaled to Plaintiff and his \ncounsel that this Plan provision was important.   And even though Defendant failed to include a \ncopy of Section 9.04 along with the July 29 letter, Defendant\u2019s counsel thereafter did sen d a copy \nof the Plan  (including Section 9.04) to Plaintiff\u2019s counsel.  Indeed, during oral argument, \nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel acknowledge d that he received those Plan documents, and that  \u201ctechnically as \nan attorney  [Section 9.04\u2019s notice of the right to request a hearing] probably should not have \ngotten past \u201d him.  (Tr. at 69-75)   \nTherefore , looking at the record as a whole, Defendant provided Plaintiff sufficient \ninformation about his right to request a hearing.11  Defendant th us cannot be blamed for \nPlaintiff\u2019s failure to do so thereafter .   \n \n11  The Court notes that the Plan facially requires that if a participant wishes to \nrequest a hearing, the person has to do so within 60 days of written notification of claim denial.  \n(D.I. 23 at AR10075)  This 60- day period would have expired on Septem ber 27, 2019 (i.e., 60 \ndays from July 29, 2019), which is the day after Defendant provided the relevant Plan documents to Plaintiff.  (D.I. 39, ex. 1)  One could thus argue that it would have been nearly impossible for Plaintiff to request a hearing in a t imely manner , in light of this timeline.  Yet Plaintiff\u2019s \nNovember 1, 2019 appeal was filed well after the 60- day deadline, and Defendant still \nconsidered that appeal on the merits.  (D.I. 25 at 7)  And so it is reasonable to presume that Defendant would have considered an untimely request for a hearing in these circumstances too.  (See Tr. at 53- 54)  22 2. Defendant\u2019s Alleged Failure to Provide Plaintiff with the  Facts Upon \nWhich Defendant\u2019s Decision was Based  \n \nPlaintiff\u2019s second \u201cprocedural\u201d argument  is that Defendant failed to provide him with the \nactual facts upon which Defendant\u2019s decision was based\u2014and that this, in turn, prevented \nPlaintiff from having a full and fair review of the denial of his benefits.  (D.I. 34 at 2, 11, 20- 21; \nTr. at 66, 75)  To this charge, Defendant retorts that the July 29 letter provided all of the required \ninformation ; it argues that Plaintiff\u2019s subsequent appeal \u2014in which Plaintiff  \u201cmounted a fulsome \nargument in response\u201d \u2014demonstrates that he had a robust understanding of the relevant facts \nand issues .  (D.I. 39 at 5- 7; see also  Tr. at 57)     \nThe Claims Procedure Regulation sets out what is required by a notice of denial of \nbenef its.  29 C.F.R \u00a7 2560.503- 1(g)(1)(i)- (iv).  As relevant to this argument, a notice of denial \nbenefits must include:  (1) the specific reason(s) for the adverse determination ; and (2) reference \nto the specific plan provisions on which the determination is based.  Id.    \nHere, the July 29 letter identified that benefits were denied because, inter alia , \u201cit has \ncome to the attention of the Plan Administrator that [ Plaintiff  is] currently working in \n\u2018Disqualifying E mployment.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 23 at AR00019)12  The July 29 letter also identifies Section \n7.01(e) as the Plan provision on which the determination was based.  ( Id.)    \n \n12  As previously noted, t he July 29 letter also advised that Plaintiff\u2019s pension \nbenefits were suspended for a second reason:  i.e., because Plaintiff indicat ed on his application \nthat he \u201cwould be doing plumbing and pipefitting work.\u201d  (D.I. 23 at AR00019)  This is an \nincorrect statement .  In fact,  Plaintiff\u2019s application for benefits stated that if he were to work after \nretirement \u201c[i]t will not  be mech. pipefitting /plumbing[.]\u201d  (Id.  at AR00011 (emphasis added); \nsee also id. at AR00040; Tr. at 50- 51)  However, the July 29 letter makes clear that there was  \nalso an \u201caddition[al]\u201d reason for the suspension of benefits :  that Plaintiff\u2019s current work was \ndeemed to be \u201cDisqualifying E mployment .\u201d  That second reason (as noted above) was well \nsupported by the record, and so this error in the July 29 letter is  harmless.   23 Plaintiff raises a fair point regarding the sufficiency of the July 29 letter .  The letter  \nclearly could have  identif ied the particular fac ts and circumstances  that were brought to the \nattention of Defendant , which in turn led to the determination that Plaintiff was \u201ccurrently \nworking in \u2018Disqualifying Employment.\u2019\u201d   But it did not .  So on this point, the  letter c an be said \nto have been undul y conclusory.  See, e.g., Miller , 632 F.3d at 852 (\u201cThe language in the letter is \nmore akin to the conclusory statements in [certain cases], where the plan administrator \nsummarily concluded that the claimant was ineligible, or that the evidence received di d not \nsupport the claim without providing further factual support.\u201d) .   \nThat said, it does not seem that this deficiency prohibited Plaintiff from having a \nsufficiently clear understanding of the A dministrator\u2019s position \u2014i.e., that Plaintiff , in light of t he \nwork he was performing at the Refinery, was engaged in \u201c Disqualifying Employment \u201d pursuant \nto Section 7.01(e).  Plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s initial responsive letter on September 11, 2019 did not \nask Defendant to provide any further facts supporting the \u201cDisqualifying Employment\u201d conclusion; instead, that letter simply requested relevant documents.  (D.I. 23 at AR00037- 38)  \nAnd Plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s subsequent November 1 letter express ed no confusion about the factual \nbasis upon which Defendant \u2019s decision rest ed.  Instead, in that November 1 letter, Plaintiff\u2019s \ncounsel articulated Plaintiff\u2019s contrary view as to  why his employment did not meet Section \n7.01(e)(1) and 7.01(e)(3) \u2019s definition of \u201cDisqualifying Employment.\u201d   (Id. at AR00041 \n(Plaintiff\u2019s counsel asserting, inter alia , that the Refinery \u201cdoes [not] supervise\u201d plumbers and \npipefitters and that the Refinery simply instructs those persons to perform their work in a timely manner) )  Thus, this does not appear to be a situation in which the July 29 letter\u2019s shortcomings \ncaused Plaintiff harm in seeking review of Defendant\u2019s decision.  See, e.g., Siebert v. Cent. \nStates Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund, 496 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 1164- 65 (N.D. Ill. 2020) 24 (rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s ar gument that the defendant\u2019s notice of denial of benefits, which stated \nlittle more than plaintiff had not met the relevant requirement of the plan, justified relief, where it \nwas clear from the documents that the plaintiff \u201c was not harmed from the defect  because he \nknew and understood the basis for the decision and ran into no real difficulty challenging it, apart from the fact that the decisions ultimately went against him on the merits\u201d) ; Dennis v. Bd. of \nTrustees of Food Em p\u2019rs. Labor Relations Ass\u2019n, 620 F. Supp. 572, 576 (M.D. Pa. 1985) \n(concluding that plaintiff\u2019s procedural objection regarding the defendant\u2019s suspension of benefits notification was \u201ctechnical\u201d and did not warrant reinstatement of benefits , where plaintiff\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s responsive letter  seeking reconsideration of the defendant\u2019s decision \u201cclearly indicates \nplaintiffs\u2019 knowledge of why benefits were denied and s ets forth fully plaintiffs\u2019 arguments for \nreinstatement\u201d); see also  (Tr. at 75 -76).   \nMoreover, some courts have explained that e ven if a plan administrator\u2019s denial could be \nsaid to violate E RISA\u2019s Section 503 notice requirements, if a remand would be a useless \nformality,  then  remanding the case is not required.  See B arnes v. AT&T Pension Benefit Plan \u2013 \nNonbargaine d Program , No. C -08-4058 EMC, 2012 WL 1657054, at *6 (N.D. Cal. May 10, \n2012) (citing cases); see also, e.g., Clark v. CertainTeed Salaried Pension Plan, 860 F. App\u2019x 337, 340 (5th Cir. 2021) ( \u201cEven assuming that [the plan administrator ] acted improperly . . . no \namount of review can change the fact that Clark is ineligible for benefits under the plain terms of the [ p] lan.  In other words, remanding Clark\u2019s benefits here would be a useless formality .\u201d) \n(internal quotation marks and citat ion omitted) ; Blanch v. Chubb & Sons, Inc., Civil No. CCB -\n12-1965, 2017 WL 2361088, at *3 (D. Md. May 31, 2017) (\u201cWhere, as here, remand would be a \n\u2018useless formality\u2019 that would generate the same outcome, courts enter judgment for the \ndefendant ERISA plan  rather than waste parties\u2019 resources with such a f utile remedy.\u201d)  (citation 25 omitted) .  Such a result makes sense, because otherwise \u201callowing a claim for relief because of \ninadequacy of formal notice without any showing that a precisely correct form of notice would \nhave made a difference would result in benefit claims outcomes inconsistent with ERISA [\u2019s] \naims of providing secure funding of employee benefit plans.\u201d  Siebert , 496 F. Supp. 3d at 1165 \n(quoting Terry v. Bayer Corp. , 145 F.3d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1998)).   \nHere, even if Defendant\u2019s cursory explanation for its conclusion regarding \u201cDisqualifying \nEmployment\u201d violate d Section 503, any remand on that basis to the Administrator would be \nfutile.  That is because,  as explained above  in Section III. A, even considering Plaintiff\u2019s own \ndescription of his employment  at the Refinery, it fell within  a reasonable interpretation of \nSection 7.01(e)(3)\u2019s definition of \u201cDisqualifying Employment .\u201d \n3. Defendant\u2019s Alleged Failure to Advise Plaintiff of What Materials  or \nInformation Would Be Necessary to Perfect His Claim  \n  \nPlaintiff\u2019s third and final argument regarding procedural violations is that Defendant \nfailed to advise P laintiff what materials or information would be necessary to perfect his claim.   \n(D.I. 34 at 17; Tr. at 100)  T he Claims Procedure Regulation requires that a notice of denial of \nbenefits  must include, inter alia , a \u201cdescription of any additional material or information \nnecessary for the claimant to per fect the claim and an explanatio n of why such material and \ninformation is necessary[ .]\u201d  29 C.F.R \u00a7 2560.503 -1(g)(1)(iii).   \nDefendant\u2019s July 29 letter did inform Plaintiff to \u201csubmit any written comments, \ndocuments and records that support your claim, even if not considered in the initial benefit \ndenial[ .]\u201d  (D.I. 23 at AR00020)   But P laintiff nevertheless faults Defendant for failing to \nelaborate as to what specific  materials P laintiff should submit , such as Plaintiff\u2019s \u201c job \ndescription, communications , witness statements attesting  to what type of work he did, and did 26 not do, or statements from his [] employer [.]\u201d  (D.I. 34 at 17)  Defendant, in response, contends \nthat the primary relevant fact here was Plaintiff\u2019s employment as a supervisor at the Refinery, \nand that Plaintiff\u2019s pos ition wrongly \u201cpresupposes that there is material or information that \nDefendant [would have known, when it sent the July 29 letter , that ] Plaintiff could  [have]  \nprovide [d] to perfect his claim.\u201d   (D.I. 39 at 7; see also  Tr. at 105)   \nThe Court disagrees with Plaintiff that there was a procedural violation here.  As noted \nabove, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s November 1 letter demonstrated a  strong understanding of the \nprimary issue  regarding the claim denial .  And if (for example) Plaintiff or his counsel had \nactually been in possession of a job description or a witness statement that would have \nsuccessfully co ntradic ted the basis for Defendant\u2019s decision, then the July 29 letter\u2019s invitation to \nsubmit \u201cany written comments, documents and records that support your claim\u201d seems like it would have reasonably prompted submission of those types of documents along with any appeal.   \nFor this reason, in the Court\u2019s view, the July 29 letter was at least in substantial compliance with this as pect of the Claim s Procedure Regulation.  See, e.g., Mazur v. Hartford Life & Accident \nCo., Civil Action No. 06- 01045, 2007 WL 4233400, at * 14 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 28, 2007)  (rejecting \nplaintiff\u2019s argument that a termination letter failed to describe what additional material or \ninformation w as needed to establish plaintiff\u2019s disability , where \u201c[d]uring the pendency of the \nappeal process, Mazur was represented by counsel having at least some familiarity with what is required to establish continuing disability. . . . While it is true that Hartford\u2019s letter did not identify the precise evidence that would negate its initial termination decision, it was not required to do so\u201d).   27 Moreover, even if the Court is incorrect on this point  and the July 29 letter did violate \nSection 503 and 29 C.F.R \u00a7 2560.503- 1(g)(1)(iii),  then  for the reasons set out above, any remand \non this basis  would be futile.   \n4. Conclusion  \nPlaintiff has not demonstrated that any technical noncompliance with Section 503  \nimpacted his ability to have effective review of his benefits claim (nor would it change the \nultimate outcome here).  Thus , the Court finds that  Plaintiff\u2019s arguments regardi ng procedural \nviolations  do not warrant relief.  See Siebert , 496 F. Supp. 3d at 1166.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the  Court finds that Defendant \u2019s Motion should be  \nGRANTED.  A n appropriate Order will issue .   "}
