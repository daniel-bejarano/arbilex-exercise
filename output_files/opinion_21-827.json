No. 21- 827-JLH \n      \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff Phyllis Diane Foster  appeals from an unfavorable  decision of the Commissioner \nof the Social  Security  Administration1 denying her  application for disability  insurance benefits  \n(\u201cDIB\u201d) .  This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).   \nThe parties filed cross -motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 14; D.I. 18.)  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench on September 14 , 2022, the  Court will DENY Plaintiff \u2019s motion and \nGRANT the Commissioner \u2019s cross- motion , as I conclude that the Commissione r\u2019s decision  is \nsupported by substantial evidence and that there are no reversible errors.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissioner \u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidence  \u201cmeans \u2014and means only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d  Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n1154 (2019)  (quoting Consol . Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)) .  In reviewing \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kij akazi \nwas automatically sub stituted for former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul when she \nsucceeded him on July 9, 2021.  2 \n whether substantial evidence s upports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts  may not \u201cre -weigh the \nevidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d  Chandler v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d \n356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011) ; see also  Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014) .  In other \nwords, r eviewing courts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner \u2019s decision, even if they would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner follows a five -step s equential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third Circuit has previously explained this \nsequential analysis , and the shifting burdens that attend each step, in detail: \nThe first two steps involve threshold determinations.  In step \none, t he Commissioner must determine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.  If a claimant is \nfound to be engaging in substantial gainful activity, the disability claim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must dete rmine \nwhether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.  If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the disability claim is denied.  In step three, the Commissioner compares the medi cal \nevidence of the claimant \u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.  If the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity [(\u201cRFC\u201d)] to \nperform his past relevant work.  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final step.  At this stage, the burden of \nproduction shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in signif icant numbers in the national economy \nwhich the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of 3 \n all the claimant\u2019 s impairments in determining whether he is capable \nof performing work and is not disabled. \n \nNewell v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 545 \u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is identical whether an application seeks  disability in surance benefits  or supplemental \nsecurity income.  McCrea v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nThe Court\u2019s ruling was announced from the bench on September 14 , 2022, as follows:  \nI\u2019m ready to give you my ruling on the cross- motions for \nsummary judgment.  I will summarize the reasons for my ruling in \na moment.   But before I do, I want to be clear that my failure to \naddress a particular argument advanced by a party does not mean \nthat I did not consider it.  We have carefully considered the pertinent \nportions of the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs.  I am not going to read my understanding of the applicable law into the record today; however, we will incorporate the ruling I am about to state into a separate, writ ten document, and we will include a \nsummary of the applicable law in that document.  \n \nThe Court will deny Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment and grant the  Commissioner\u2019s cross -motion for summary \njudgment. \n Plaintiff argues that the ALJ did not give sufficient  weight \nto the medical opinions of treating providers Carina Rodriguez, MS, PT, and Michele Tjaden, FNP -PC, resulting in a  step four RFC  that \ndid not a ccount for all of Plaintiff \u2019s left upper extremity limitations. \nMs. Rodriguez performed a Functional Capacity Assessmen t on \nSeptember 11, 2019, in which she opined (among other things)  that \nPlaintiff could never perform repetitive arm motions or wrist and hand motions and has no left hand function. (Transcript of Social Security Proceedings, D.I. 10 (\u201cR.\u201d) at 901.)   Ms. Rodriguez \ncompleted a Medical Source Statement on September 19, 2019, in which she opined (among other things)  that Plaintiff could never use \nher left upper extremity to reach above her shoulders or her left arm for reaching and can rarely use her left hand for handling and fingering. (R. 904.) On October 8, 2019, Ms. Tjaden wrote to Plaintiff \u2019s counsel that she \u201c agree[d] \u201d with Ms. Rodriguez \u2019s \nSeptember 11, 2019 assessment . (R. 908.)  \n 4 \n The ALJ  considered the opinions of Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. \nTjaden regarding Plaintiff\u2019s left upper extremity limitations and \nfound that the y were \u201cnot persuasive as the overall evidence of \nrecord does not support this degree of limitation.\u201d  (R. 21.)   The ALJ \nconcluded that Plaintiff had the RFC to perform \u201csedentary work as \ndefined in 20 CFR 404.1567(a) except she can lift 10 pounds occasionally and up to 10 pounds frequentl y\u201d and \u201c can occasionally \nreach overhead with the upper left extremity.\u201d  (R. 18.)  \n I find no error in the ALJ \u2019s consideration or treatment of the \nopinions of Ms. Rodriguez  and Ms. Tjaden .  First, contrary to \nPlaintiff\u2019s argument, it is clear that the ALJ did not ignore th ose \nopinions .  Rather, the ALJ \u2019s written decision made clear that he \nconsidered them but did not  credit them.   What\u2019s more, t he ALJ\u2019s \ndecision to give less weight  to those opinions is consistent with  20 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c( c)(2), whic h explains that t he agency may find \na particular medical opinion to be  less persuasive when it is less \nconsistent with the evidence from other medical sources and nonmedical sources in the record.  F or example, the ALJ explained \nthat the opinions of Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Tjaden that Plaintiff had \nlittle to  no use of her left arm and hand were i nconsisten t with record \nevidence  that Plaintiff  had elected  a conservative course of \ntreatment , consisting of over the counter medication and aqua \ntherapy.  (R. 21.)  The A LJ also found that such extensive limitations  \nwere inconsistent with the record evidence of Plaintiff \u2019s daily living \nactivities, which included  (among other things)  folding laundry and  \ndriving.  ( Id.)  The ALJ\u2019s written opinion was extensive, and I \ndisagree with Plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that the ALJ  failed to \nsufficiently explain why he gave the opinions of Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Tjaden less weight.\n2   \n \n Moreover, there is s ubstantial evidence to support the ALJ \u2019s \ndecision not to include more restrictive left upper extremity \nlimitations in the RFC.   In addition to considering the records of \nPlaintiff\u2019s other treating physicians, the ALJ also found persuasive  \nthe state administrative medical findings of Dr. Michel , who opined \nthat Plaintiff had  the capacity to perform work at the light  exertional \nlevel with occasional reaching overhead of the left arm and no limitations on reaching, fingering, or handling.  After  reviewing all \nof the evidence, the ALJ adopted an RFC that was more restrictive than even that suggested by Dr. Michel.  The ALJ explained that the sedentary  exertion level \u201caddress[es] the combination of \n[Plaintiff\u2019s] impairments,\u201d and that her reduced left shoulder range \n \n2 See Hur v. Barnhart , 94 F. App\u2019x 130, 133 (3d Cir. 2004) (\u201cThere is no requirement that \nthe ALJ discuss in its opinion every tidbit of evidence included in the record.\u201d).  5 \n of motion \u201csupports the lifting limitations inherent in\u201d sedentary \nwork.  (R. 21.)  \n \nPlaintiff takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s characterization o f her \nliving activities as \u201c extensive. \u201d  (R. 21.)  Whether or not that  \ncharacterization is accurate, the details of Plaintiff\u2019s  self-reported \nactivities, in combination with the other evidence the ALJ considered, was sufficient to satisfy the substantial e vidence \nthreshold.  I do not agree that the ALJ impermissibly equated \nPlaintiff\u2019s activities of daily living with her ability to perform \nsustained competitive work.  The ALJ\u2019s decision makes clear that \nhe based his RFC finding on the entire record, which i ncluded \nevidence of her living activities as well as medical evidence.   \n Finally, Plaintiff argues  that \u201c[t]he ALJ \u2019s \u2018credibility \u2019 \nassessment is generally defective . . . because of his failure to consider Plaintiff\u2019s stellar work history in h[is] assessment.\u201d  (D.I. 15 at 16.)  At bottom, Plaintiff\u2019s argument is  that the ALJ should \nhave believed Plaintiff \u2019s testimony about her inability to work  \nbecause Plaintiff  is credible , as evidenced by the fact that she \nworked for many years before applying for Social Security disability benefits.   But there is  no requirement in the law or regulation s that \nan ALJ give controlling weight to the testimony of claimants with \nlengthy work histories.  The regulations do provide that a claimant \u2019s \nprior work record is one of many factors that  an ALJ may consider \nin evaluating the claimant \u2019s symptoms and symptom -related \nfunctional limitations.\n3 Here, the ALJ \u2019s written decision  \nacknowledged that Plaintiff had a lengthy work history in the insurance  industry.  The ALJ\u2019s failure to further discuss Plaintiff\u2019s \nwork history was  not reversible error.\n4   \n \n  \n \n3 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3).  \n \n4 See Lewis v. Berryhill , No. CV 18- 200-LPS, 2019 WL 1236694, at *7 (D. Del. Mar. 18, \n2019)  (rejecting claimant\u2019s argument that the ALJ \u2019s \u201ccredibility finding\u201d was flawed because it \ndid not  expressly mention plaintiff\u2019s work history) ; Skrbin v. Colvin, 2016 WL 5390140, at *4 \n(W.D. Pa. Sept. 26, 2016)  (same) . 6 \n III. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff \u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 14) is \nDENIED and the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion (D.I. 18) is  GRANTED.  \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendant and to CLOSE the \ncase.  \n \nDated: September 14 , 2022   ______________________________ \n      The Honorable Jennifer L.
