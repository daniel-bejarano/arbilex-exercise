(\u201cGCE\u201d), Brian E. Mueller (\u201cMueller\u201d) and Daniel E. \nBachus (\u201cBachus\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d), pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securitie s Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78t(a) (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and \nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5.  Presently before the Court is Defendants\u2019 motion (the \u201cMotion\u201d) to dismiss Plainti ffs\u2019 Second \nAmended Consolidated Complaint (the \u201cSAC\u201d), filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  (D.I.  61)  For the following reasons, the Court recommends that \nDefendants\u2019 Motion be DENIED.  \nI. BACKGROUND A. The Parties  \n1. Lead Plaintiffs  \nThe Lead Plaintiffs in this case are Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado \n(\u201cColorado FPPA\u201d), Oakland County Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cOakland County ERS\u201d) and Oakland County Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association Trust (collectively with Oakland County ERS, \u201cOakland County\u201d).  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27)  Colorado FPPA is a benefit pension plan that purchased shares of GCE stock during the Class Period.  ( Id. at \u00b6 26)  Oakland \nCounty are entities that provide retirement benefits to employees of Oakland County, Michigan and that also purchased GCE stock during the Class Period.  ( Id. at \u00b6 27)  These Lead Plaintiffs 2 are bringing the instant action individually and on behalf of all other persons who purchased the \ncommon stock of GCE during the Class Period.  ( Id. at 1)  The Class Period runs from January 5, \n2018 through January 27, 2020.  ( Id.) \n2. Defendants  \nDefendant GCE  is a public company and a Delaware corporation.  ( Id. at \u00b6 28)  It \noperated as a \u201cfor-profit Christian University\u201d from 2004 until July 2018, when it became an online program management (\u201cOPM\u201d) company that \u201cprovide[s] management, back- office [] and \nother services to educational institutions.\u201d  ( Id.)   \nDefendant Mueller is GCE\u2019s Chief E xecutive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) (having held that role \nsince July 2008) and Chairman (having held that role since January 2017).  ( Id. at \u00b6 29)  Mueller \nalso has served as President of Grand Canyon University (\u201cGCU\u201d or \u201cUniversity\u201d) since 2012.  (Id.)  Bachus is GCE\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d); he has  held that role since 2008.  ( Id. at \n\u00b6 30)   \nB. Key Background Facts Regarding the Litigation\n1 \n1. GCU, Its Status as a For-profit Entity and the 2014 Conversion \nGCU was formerly known as Grand Canyon College.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33)  In 2004, Grand \nCanyon College was on the verge of bankruptcy and was acquired by Significant Education, LLC (\u201cSignificant\u201d).  ( Id.)  Significant transformed Grand Canyon College into GCU\u2014the first \n \n1   In this Report and Recommendation, almost every fact of record that the Court \ncites will be drawn from the text of the SAC itself.  The SAC is extremely lengthy, as it spans \n132 pages and includes 379 separate numbered paragraphs.  (D.I. 60)  In light of that, it would not be feasible or sensible for the Court to list every fact contained in the SAC.  Instead, the Court below has made a good faith (and still lengthy) effort to summarize the key facts in the SAC that relate to the issues discussed in the parties\u2019 briefing and in this Report and Recommendation .   \n 3 for-profit Christian university in the United States, and one primarily focused on online \neducation for working adults.  ( Id.)  In 2008, Significant changed its name to GCE.  ( Id.)   \nIn recent years, a series of major scandals involving other for -profit educational \ncompanies brought negative attention to the for -profit sector.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 34-39)  As government \nscrutiny of for -profit institutions increased and the public reputation of such institutions \ndecreased, key figures in the for -profit industry began identifying alternate approaches that could \ngive educational companies access to the public stock market while avoiding the stigma \nassociated with the \u201cfor -profit\u201d label.  ( Id. at \u00b6 38)  The SAC alleges that one approach was to \nadopt a \u201c\u2018hybrid\u2019 model\u201d that \u201callow[ed] [companies] to take advantage of the interest of \nfinancial investors in the higher -education market\u201d while purportedly preserving the \u201ckey \nattributes of non- profit private or public colleges.\u201d  ( Id. (internal quotation marks omitted)  \n(alteration in original) ) \nBy 2014, Mueller and Bachus began to explore a conversion (the \u201c2014 Conversion\u201d) of \nGCU from a for- profit to a non- profit institution, in part to distance the school from the stigma \naround for -profit schools.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 40 -41)  The SAC alleges that GCE thus \u201cpursued a \nrestru cturing [ by which]  it would spin off its educational assets\u201d by \u201csell[ing] GCU to a newly \nformed non- profit organization called Gazelle University[, which would then be renamed] Grand \nCanyon University\u201d at the close of the transaction.  ( Id.)  After the tr ansaction, GCE would \nremain a for -profit company and would provide educational services to the now purportedly non-\nprofit new GCU.  ( Id. at \u00b6 41)   \nIn conjunction with the 2014 Conversion, on October 8, 2015, GCE applied to the United \nStates Internal Revenue S ervice (\u201cIRS\u201d) for recognition of GCU as a tax -exempt non- profit 4 organization.  ( Id. at \u00b6 145)  The IRS granted the requested exemption on November 9, 2015.2  \n(Id.)  The SAC does not indicate that , prior to the IRS\u2019s decision, GCE supplied any documents \nto the IRS that described t he structure of the proposed 2014 Conversion. \nGCE also applied to its regional accreditation body, the Higher Learning Commission \n(\u201cHLC\u201d), for a Change in Control, Structure or Organization (\u201cChange in Control\u201d)\u2014a \nprerequisite to executing the 2014 Conversion.  ( Id. at \u00b6 42)  Karen Solinski, an experienced \nregulatory lawyer, chaired the HLC\u2019s fact -finding evaluation team that analyzed GCU\u2019s 2014 \nConversion application.  ( Id. at \u00b6 43)  Solinski had served in her position at HLC f or \napproximately 20 years, wrote HLC\u2019s Change of Control, Structure and Organization policy, and led more than 50 Change of Control evaluations by the time GCE applied to the HLC.  ( Id.)  On \nFebruary 25, 2016, HLC denied GCU\u2019s Change of Control application, concluding in part that the proposed structure contravened HLC\u2019s existing accreditation requirements.  ( Id. at \u00b6 47)    \nIn parallel with submitting the 2014 Conversion to HLC, GCE had also tried to persuade \nthe United States Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d) as to the merits of its proposed conversion.  (Id. at \u00b6 50; see also id. at \u00b6 49)\n3  However, according to Solinski, GCE\u2019s outreach had not gone \nwell.  ( Id. at \u00b6 50)  Specifically, Michael Frola (\u201c Frola \u201d), a DOE Division Director, and other \nDOE lawyers had informed GCE that \u201cthe transaction would result in the DOE, HLC, and other regulatory bodies being unable to regulate significant portions of [] GCU\u2019s operations and would likely improperly benefit the newly formed for-profit company.\u201d  ( Id.)  Ultimately, accord ing to \n \n2   The SAC alleges that the IRS engages in little substantive review of such non-\nprofit recognition requests.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 145-52)  The Court will discuss additional relevant \nallegations in that regard later in this Report and Recommendation. \n \n3  The DOE \u2019s role in reviewing a requested  change in control of an educational \ninstitution like GCU is explained in more detail later in this Section.    5 Solinski, Frola notified GCE that the DOE was \u201c unlikely to approve \u201d the conversion even if \nHLC had not rejected the accreditation application.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 49-50)  The SAC alleges that \nMueller was aware of and personally involved in GCE\u2019s outreach to the DOE  in this regard.  ( Id. \nat \u00b6 52)  Indeed, at a \u201c\u2018fence- mending meeting\u2019 \u201d in May 2016 between Defendants and HLC, at \nwhich both Bachus and Mueller were present, Mueller \u201ccomplained that the DOE had given him \npushback on the 2014 Conversion [] and tha t he did not believe the DOE or HLC would bless it \nin the future.\u201d   (Id.)  Given these issues, Mueller announced that the company would not be \nreapplying to convert GCU to non- profit status.  ( Id.)   \n2. GCE Again Seeks to Convert GCU Into a Non -profit  \nBy late 2017, however, GCE had decided to revive its plan to restructure GCU as a non-\nprofit.  The SAC alleges that what spurred Defendants\u2019 change of heart was the drastically different regulatory landscape that emerged for for -profit universit ies after Donald J. Trump was \nelected President of the United States in November 2016.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 53 -72)   \nThe SAC alleges that this landscape began to change in earnest on February 7, 2017, \nwhen the United States Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education.   (Id. at \u00b6 53)  \nImmediately thereafter, the Trump Administration began installing veterans of for -profit \neducation companies into key DOE and White House leadership roles.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 55 -61)  At the \nsame time, the DeVos DOE also began rolling back key DOE  protections against student abuses \nby for -profit institutions.  ( Id. at \u00b6 62)  Finally, the Trump Administration also signaled a shift in \nhow strictly the federal government might scrutinize large -scale, for -profit to non- profit \nconversions.  ( Id. at \u00b6 63 )  For instance, the DOE ultimately approved one such large -scale \nconversion in which Purdue University (\u201cPurdue\u201d) would acquire for -profit Kaplan University \n(\u201cKaplan\u201d), which would in turn become a separate third -party OPM provider  to Purdue .  (Id. at 6 \u00b6 99)  According to the terms of that deal (the \u201cPurdue -Kaplan Deal\u201d), Purdue would convert \nKaplan\u2019s programs into Purdue\u2019s new online education arm, while Kaplan would provide back -\noffice services.  ( Id.)  This deal received approval from the DOE in Septembe r 2017 and from its \naccreditor in March 2018.  ( Id.)   \nGiven this climate, what followed was a period in which for -profit to non- profit \nconversions took off.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 63 -72)  As one March 2018 article put it, \u201c\u2018one key phenomenon \nthat intersects with th e growth of higher education public -private partnerships is the rush of \nefforts to convert for -profit colleges to non- profit status in recent years.  Those efforts [ were ] \nnow being blessed by the for -profit friendly Trump -DeVos team at the Department of \nEducation.\u2019\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 71)  \nDue to the favorable and transformed regulatory environment, GCE decided in early \n2017 to submit a renewed Change of Control application to the HLC.  ( Id. at \u00b6 73)  GCE \npresented this proposed conversion (referred to herein as the \u201cConversion\u201d) as being structurally \nsimilar to the 2014 Conversion that the HLC had previously rejected.  ( Id. at \u00b6 79)  Bachus \ninformed Solinski of G CE\u2019s intent around May 2017, explaining to Solinski that the proposed \nGCU transaction was very similar to the Purdue -Kaplan Deal, which had just received pre-\nacquisition review from the DOE in April 2017.  ( Id. at \u00b6 74)  Solinski, however, informed \nBachus that she believed, based on her experience evaluating the Purdue -Kaplan Deal for the \nHLC, that there were \u201c\u2018real\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018key\u2019\u201d differences between the two deal structures.  ( Id.)  In \nsupport of her viewpoint, she pointed to publicly- available documents reg arding the Purdue -7 Kaplan Deal that detailed the alleged differences between the two, and sent Bachus articles \nclarifying those differences .  (Id.)4  \nDespite this, GCE  decided to move forward.  ( Id. at \u00b6 76)  On  January 5, 2018, GCE \nannounced that it had submitted its renewed Change in Control application to the HLC in connection with its plan to convert GCU into a non-profit university.  ( Id. at \u00b6 79)  After an \nallegedly truncated and perfunctory review,\n5 the HLC approved the Conversion in February \n2018.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 82-95)  \n \n4  The Court will explain in greater detail the  alleged differences between the two \nconversions in connection with its recitation of Defendants\u2019 alleged material misstatements \nbelow.  \n5  The SAC contains numerous paragraphs denigrating the HLC\u2019s review process \nregarding the Conversion.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6  82-93; see also  D.I. 66 at 4-5 & n.4)  These include \nallegations suggesting that HLC :  (1) c urtailed its review process for the Conversion, contrary to \nits usual practice; and (2) violated its own policy, which required that the applicant (here, GCE ) \nneeded to submit a DOE pre- acquisition letter to the HLC Board before the Board would act on \nthe application .  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 82-93)  The SAC also alleges that although Solinski told HLC \nadministrators that  she would not be the HLC staff member who substantively reviewed  the \nConversion application (due in part to her friendship and business acquaintance with Bachus), Solinski nevertheless  repeatedly  discussed the Conversion application process with Barbara \nGellman -Danley  (HLC\u2019s President), Robert Rucker (the HLC employee responsible for \nmanaging the application process) , a member of the HLC\u2019s Board of Trustees  and with Bachus \nhimself .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 87, 89-93) \n During oral argument, however, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated  that the Court should ignore all \nof these allegations in the SAC about the HLC \u2019s Conversion- related review  process.  Plaintiffs\u2019 \ncounsel explained that Plaintiffs had included these allegations because, at the time, they thought that Defendants would be asserting that the HLC\u2019s 2018 approval of GCE\u2019s Conversion application was relevant to issues at play in  the instant Motion  (such as scienter) .  (D.I. 75 \n(hereinafter \u201cTr.\u201d) at 73 -86).  But subsequently, Plaintiffs  learned that Defendants agreed with \nthem that the HLC\u2019s decision on the Conversion application is  not relevant  to the legal issues  \ninvolved with the Motion.  ( Id. at 29-32, 35, 43, 73-86; D.I. 62 at 13; D.I. 66 at 18; D.I. 68 at 8)  \nTherefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that these allegations in the SAC are \u201cimmaterial\u201d to the Motion and \u201ca sideshow[.]\u201d  ( Tr. at 82, 85)  Thus, the Court will not address  these allegations \nfurther in this  Report and Recommendation. 8 Because the Conversion would amount to a change in ownership of GCU, which would \nin turn result in a change of control over the university, GCU was statutorily required to obtain \nDOE app roval of the transaction if it wished to continue to participate in programs regarding \nTitle IV  of the Higher Education Act (\u201cTitle IV\u201d)  post-Conversion.  (D.I. 48, ex. 2 at 26); 34 \nC.F.R. 600.31(a)(3).  One option that GCE/GC U had as part of this DOE revi ew process was to \nseek a voluntary \u201cpre-acquisition review\u201d from the DOE regarding the transaction.  Pursuant to this pre-acquisition review, the DOE would \u201cdetermine whether the institution has answered all the questions on the application completely and accurately, and [would] notify the institution of the results of that review.\u201d  64 Fed. Reg. 58,608, 58,611 (Oct. 29, 1999).  The pre-acquisition review would not amount to an official approval or denial of the application for transaction approval.  But it would be a means for the DOE either to notify GCE  that its application was \napprovable or to note that its application had significant problems that would need to be addressed before approval was possible.  Id . \nGCE submitted a pre- acquisi tion review application  (the \u201cpre-acquisition application\u201d) to \nthe DOE on January 18, 2018.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 107)  This pre -acquisition application \n\u201cconsisted of, among other things, drafts of the [ Master Services Agreement , or \u2018 MSA \u2019], Asset \nPurchase Agreement [(\u201cAPA\u201d)] and Credit Agreement  [(\u201cCA\u201d) relating to the Conversion.]\u201d   \n(Id. at \u00b6 107)   With this  application, GCE not only sought approval of the change of ownership \nof GCU, but it also requested that the DOE allow GCU to convert to non- profit status for \npurposes of GCU\u2019s participation in Title IV.  ( Id., ex. A at 1)\n6  \n \n6   In assessing whether an institution like GCU qualifie s as a non -profit \norganiz ation, the DOE uses criteria similar to  the criteria that the IRS uses in order to determine \nnon-profit status .  (D.I. 60, ex. A at 10)  One of these factors  asks whether the institution at issue \n\u201c[i]s owned and operated by one or more nonprofit corporations or associations, no part of the 9 Financial analysts particu larly liked the fact that GCU might  be recognized as a non -\nprofit by the DOE due to the Conversion.  ( D.I. 60 at \u00b6 98)  For example, i n February 2018, one \nanalyst (BMO Capital Markets) not ed that this would remove the school from the for -profit \nworld w here \u201cfuture risks are unknown\u201d and another (Barrington Research) noted that this would \n\u201cde-risk [GCE] as an investment[.]\u201d  ( Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) )   \n3. Key Events Occurring Between the Submission of the DOE Pre-\nacquisition  Application and the Closing of the Conversion  \nFrom March to early May 2018, Mueller made statements to the effect that he expected \nthe DOE\u2019s review of the pre- acquisition application to be completed by mid- to-late May 2018.  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 110 -13, 118)  Muell er and Bachus also indicated that they planned to proceed forward \nwith the Conversion only after the DOE\u2019s review was complete (i.e., \u201cby July 1\u201d).  ( Id. at \u00b6 112)  \nHowever, the DOE did not complete its review of the pre -acquisition application by May \n2018.  Instead, i n connection with its review process, on May 17, 2018, the DOE propounded a \nseries of interrogatories to GCE (the \u201cinterrogatories\u201d or the \u201cMay 2018 interrogatories\u201d) .  (Id. at \n\u00b6 119)  The interrogatories  contained 25 requests ( with subparts) for responses and documents, \nincluding:  \n\u2022 \u201cProduce any appraisals, valuations, valuation summaries, or \nvaluation reviews obtained or commissioned by any party to the Transaction for purposes of valuing the Transaction[ .]\u201d \n \n\u2022 \u201cState whether GCE is a company with which [GCU] or the \nFoundation does \u2018 substantial business \u2019 as used in Article III of the \nFoundation\u2019s Bylaws.\u201d  \n \n \nnet earnings of which benefits any private shareholder or individual[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 9 )  As is further \ndiscussed below, t his factor would end up being important to the DOE\u2019s ultimate decision on \nGCE/GC U\u2019s request for non- profit status.  10 \u2022 \u201cDescribe the due diligence efforts by [GCU] and the Foundation \nwith respect to the Transaction and produce any documents \nrelating thereto. \u201d \n \n\u2022 \u201cProduce any PowerPoint presentations, summaries, reports, or \nsimilar documents presented to the Boards of [GCU], the Foundation, and GCE related to the Transaction.\u201d  \n \n\u2022 \u201cProduce all documents assessing or analyzing the financial impact \nof the Tran saction on [GCU], the Foundation, or GCE, including \ndocuments reflecting projected revenue streams/losses as a result of the Transaction, including any pro formas relating to the MSA.\u201d  \n \n\u2022 \u201cProduce board meeting minutes, resolutions or consents relating \nto the Transaction.  This request includes the boards of [GCU], the Foundation, and GCE (and any subcommittees thereof).\u201d  \n \n\u2022 \u201cProvide the schedule of employees to be transferred to [GCU] as \ncontemplated in APA, \u00a7 6.4.  Include each employee\u2019s current \nsalary and the terms of any other compensation to which the employee is or may be entitled.\u201d  \n \n\u2022 \u201cIdentify any GCE employees to be jointly employed by GCE and \n[GCU] and explain how joint employee compensation has been or will be determined. \u201d \n \n\u2022 \u201cProduce any Schedules or Exhibits to the APA, MSA, and CA not \npreviously provided and produce any amendments to the draft documents previously provided.\u201d  \n \n\u2022 \u201cIdentify all persons or entities that have been engaged to perform \nany transfer pricing study in connection with the Transaction, their engagement letters, and any studies produced by them.\u201d  \n \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 119 -20 (emphasis omitted , some alteration in original))  The S AC alleges that \u201c[ t]he \nextent of these new interrogatories indicated that the DOE was not inclined to rubber -stamp the \nConversion and, in fact , had serious questions about the independence of [GCU] from [GCE].\u201d  \n(Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 121-22)  Despite the ir import , Defendants did not disclose to the market tha t the DOE \nhad propounded the se interrogatories , nor that DOE had raised serious questions (via the \ninterrogatories) about the Conversion.  ( Id. at \u00b6 125)   11 Instead, the SAC alleges that when questioned during this time period as to why the DOE \nhad not yet approved the Conversion, Mueller made false and misleading statements.  For \nexample, on July 2, 2018, Mueller is alleged to have falsely  stated in an article in  The Chronicle \nof Higher Education that the DOE pre-approval process normally takes 45 days, but that it was taking longer in GCE\u2019s case because the DOE was \u201c \u2018very understaffed .\u2019\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 134-35, \n281 (emphasis omitted) )\n7 \nAlthough GCE had not yet received a decision from  the DOE  regarding the pre-\nacquisition application, and despite the fact that it was clear to Defendants that there was a significant risk that the DOE would not approve the Conversion (in light of Frola \u2019s prior \ncomments about the 2014 Conversion and the content of the May 2018 interrogatories), GCE \nnevertheless decided to move forward with the Conversion even without having received \napproval of the pre-acquisition application.  ( Id. at \u00b6 125)  Mueller and Bachus now explained to \nthe public that the Conversion could close without DOE approval.  ( Id.)  This comforted certain \nanalysts, with one bank ( Piper Jaffray ) reporting thereafter that the Conversion was \u201c\u2018on track \nfor a July/August close\u2019\u201d and that, based on conversations it had with Mueller and Bachus, the DOE review process was \u201c\u2018 largely procedural[.] \u2019\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 126-27)  The  SAC alleges that \nDefendants chose to move ahead  with the Conversion, even despite the real risks that the DOE \nwould not approve GCU\u2019s application in full, due to a number of factors including:  (1) the sunk costs Defendants had already poured into preparing the application and the Conversion, ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n \n7   At another point in the SAC, Plaintiffs appear to allege that Mueller made this \nsame \u201c\u2018very understaffed\u2019\u201d comment on June 12, 2018.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 335- 36)  It is not clear if \nPlaintiffs mean to  assert  that Mueller made this same statement on two different da tes in two \ndifferent fora, or if there is simply a mistake in the SAC and Mueller made the comment only \nonce in The Chronicle of Higher Education in July 2018. 12 14, 123, 342) ; (2) the fact that after it closed the Conversion (but before  it received a final \nresponse from the DOE ), GCU could market itself to prospective students as a non- profit \ninstitution, which in turn could increase enrollment and revenue/ profit  for GC E during that time , \n(id. at \u00b6\u00b6 153- 71, 342 ); and ( 3) that there was a \u201cpotentially narrow window of time in which \nSecretary DeVos\u2019 [] DO E would be in place to squeeze through the Conversion [were it to \nultimately be approved] \u2014but there would be no chance of approval if the political climate \nshifted again[,]\u201d ( id. at \u00b6 16). \nOn July 2, 2018, GCE filed with the SEC a Form 8- K (the \u201cJuly 2, 2018 8- K\u201d), \n\u201cannouncing that it had closed the Conversion by executing the APA [,] whereby it sold the GCU \ncampus and all academic related operations and assets to [ the new ] GCU.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 130)  The \nJuly 2, 2018 8- K also stated that GCE and GCU had entered into the MSA, whereby GCE would \nprovide \u201c\u2018identified technological, counseling, marketing, financial aid processing and other \nsupport se rvices to [] GCU in return for 60% of [] GCU\u2019s tuition and fee revenue[.]\u2019\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 \n132)   \nSince the Conversi on had now closed without the DOE responding to GCU\u2019s pre -\nacquisition application, GC U moved on to seek DOE\u2019s post -closing approval of the Conversion.  \nTo that end, GCU timely submitted to the DOE an application and other documentation, in order \nto satisfy  the DOE\u2019s change in control regulatory requirements.  ( Id., ex. A at 1)  As part of this \napplication, GCU not only sought DOE\u2019s approval for the change in ownership of the institution, but it again asked for t he DOE to recognize the new GCU as a non -profit institution for Title IV \npurposes.  ( Id. at 1, 16- 17)   \nAdditionally, on July 17, 2018, more than two weeks after the close of the Conversion, \nGCU requested that the IRS re- affirm the new GCU\u2019s  tax-exempt non- profit status .  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 13 145)  The IRS did so, granting GCU non -profit status on August 31, 2018.  ( Id. at \u00b6 145)  The \nSAC alleges that the IRS reviewed \u201c[n]o . . . documents\u201d in coming to this decision, ( id.), and  \nincludes a number of allegations indicating t hat the IRS  has been roundly criticized for \u201crubber -\nstamping applications of for -profit institutions attempting to convert to [ non-profits ]\u201d and for \nrelying too heavily on declarations and representations made by the applicants as part of its \nreview process , (id. at \u00b6 146; see also id . at \u00b6\u00b6 147- 52). \nAfter the Conversion closed,  the DOE continued to send GC U additional requests for \nfurther information , including:  (1) on July 3, 2018, the DOE requested audited financial \nstatements and a copy of GCU\u2019s default management plan; (2) on August 24, 2018, the DOE asked GCU for copies of the final Conversion deal documents and an audited same -day balance \nsheet  for GCU ; and (3) o n September 10, 2018, the DOE requested a \u201c\u2018 narrative\u2019\u201d  explaining \nhow the structure of the Conversion \u201c\u2018 warrant[ed] recognizing the institutions\u2019 conversion to \nnon[-]profit status for the purposes of  . . . Title IV. \u2019\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 140 (some alteration in or iginal) )  \nDuring the DOE review process, GCE responded to these and other requests by providing t he \nDOE with \u201cnumerous non- public documents[,]\u201d including:  (1) the fully unredacted MSA ; (2) a \nreport from Barclays dated April 26, 2018 (the \u201cBarclays Report\u201d ); (3) a \u201c\u2018follow -on\u2019\u201d Barclays \nreport discussed with GCE\u2019s Board of Directors on June 20, 2018 (the \u201cBarclays Update\u201d); and (4) a \u201c\u2018 Transfer Pricing Report \u2019\u201d for 2018 prepared by Deloitte  & Touche  LLP (the \u201cDeloitte \nReport\u201d).  ( Id. at \u00b6 173)  \n4. GCE\u2019s Strong Post -Conversion Financial Results, the DOE\u2019s Decision \nand the Aftermath  \nBetween the time period when the Conversion closed in July 2018 and when the  DOE \nmade a final decision on GCU\u2019s application, G CE reported  \u201cstrong financial results that \nroutinel y exceeded market expectations [.]\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 166)  For example, GCE\u2019s operating profit 14 margins \u201cshowed immediate, enormous growth\u201d following the Conversion\u2014growth that \ncontinued from the third quarter of 2018 through the third quarter of 2019.  ( Id. at \u00b6 167)  GCE \nrepeatedly attributed its growing revenues and margins to the Conversion and to the fact that GCU was now marketing itself as a non -profit institution and in turn had increased enrollment.  \n(Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 157-65)\n8  For instance, as a for -profit institution , GCE/GCU was  barred from \nmarketing to students in certain school districts, including the Los Angeles Unified School District (which at one point had around 700,000 students).  ( Id. at \u00b6 154)  Upon announcing that \nit was converting to a non-profit, however, GCU was able to reach a much larger number of potential students; those potential students, in turn, were more likely to enroll in the \u201cnon- profit \u201d \nGCU because they believed non -profit institution s were more likely to have a student\u2019s best \ninterests at heart.  ( Id. at \u00b6 159)  The SAC alleges that GC U took full advantage of the benefits of \nmarketing itself as a non- profit , including by immediately changing its marketing tagline to \n\u201cPrivate. Christian . Affordable. Nonprofit.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 157) \nIn November 2019, however, the DOE finally made its decision on GCU\u2019s pending \napplication.  On November 6, 2019, the DOE sent to GCU a letter (the \u201cDOE Letter\u201d) , signed by \nFrola , who was then the Dire ctor of the DOE\u2019s Multi-Regional and Foreign Schools Participation \nDivision .  (D.I. 60, ex. A)   The DOE Letter stated that the DOE :  (1) had approved the change in \nownership application; (2) had approved the new GCU to be designated a for- profit institution \nfor purposes of its continued participation in Title IV programs; but (3) was denying the new GCU\u2019s request for recognition of the institution as a non-profit.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 \u00b6 237-38; see also \n \n8  The SAC also contains accounts from three confidential witnesses, each former \nGCE employees, to the effect that post-Conversion, GCE also began to engage in aggressive and \nabusive recruitment strategies in order to further increase enrollments.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 206-12 )   15 id., ex. A at 16- 17)  On the last point regarding non- profit status, the DOE explained that GCU \nhad not established that it was \u201coperated by a nonprofit and [that its] net earnings [did not] \nbenefit any private shareholder or individual\u201d as required under applicable regulations.  (D.I. 60, ex. A at 10- 17)  The D OE Letter concluded that this was so in part because the Conversion \n\u201c\u2018violate[d] the most basic tenet of non[ -]profit status \u2014that the non[ -]profit be primarily \noperated for a tax -exempt pu rpose and not substantially for the benefit of any other person or \nentity.\u2019\u201d  ( D.I. 60 at \u00b6 173 (some alteration in original) )  Instead, the DOE  concluded that \u201c\u2018the \nprimary purpose of the MSA\u2019 was to \u2018drive shareholder value for GCE with GCU as its captive client \u2014potentially in perpetuity.\u2019\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 182)   \nThe DOE came to this conclusion for a number of reasons.  These included:  (1) \nconsideration of certain aspects of the Conversion relating to GCE\u2019s future expected income and \nexpenses \u2014including the fact that GCE would incur only 28% of the costs of operating GCU \nwhile receiving 95%  of GCU\u2019s revenues each year; (2) its view that GCU and GCE were not \ntruly independent from each other \u2014due in part to the fact that Mueller was both President of \nGCU and the CEO of GCE, and to the large number of GCE executives who were to manage and oversee GCU\u2019s work; and (3) that it would be financially onerous and impractical for GCU to terminate its services agreement with GCE.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 172- 75, 177- 78, 316;  id., ex. A at 12- 16)  \nGCE disclosed the DOE\u2019s decision to the market during a November 6, 2019 earnings \ncall and again in a November 7, 2019 SEC filing  (the \u201cNovember 6/7, 2019 announcements\u201d) ; \nthereafter, GCE\u2019s stock price \u201cplummeted[ ,]\u201d dropping $6.99 between November 6- 8, 2019.  16 (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 237-39)9  Analysts connected this decline to the fact of the DOE\u2019s decision.  ( Id. at \n\u00b6 240) \nThereafter, on January 28, 2020, analyst Citron Research (\u201cCitron\u201d) published a nearly \n50-page report titled \u201cThe Educational Enron:  The Multiple Smoking Guns that Prove [GCE] is \nUsing a Captive Subsidiary to Manipulate Earnings\u201d (the \u201cCitron Report\u201d).  ( Id. at \u00b6 250)  The \nSAC alleges that GCE\u2019s stock fell again after th is disclosure, falling $7.43 per share from \nJanuary 27-28, 2019.  ( Id. at \u00b6 256) \nC. Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations  Regarding the Alleged Fraudulent Scheme  \nHaving set out the relevant background facts above, next the Court will summarize \nPlaintiffs\u2019 description of De fendants\u2019 alleged fraudulent scheme.  \nThe S AC alleges that th is case arises from Defendants\u2019 materially false and misleading \nstatements or omissions about the Conversion.  ( Id. at \u00b6 1)  Defendants allegedly claimed that the \nConversion would result in GCU becoming an independent, non- profit institution  under separate \nmanagement from GCE , that the Conversion was virtually identical to other approved \ntransactions, and that after the Conversion, GCE would merely act as a third -party service \nprovider to GCU.  ( Id.)  These claims allowed Defendants to avoid the \u201c\u2018 stigma \u2019\u201d of for- profit \neducation and to market GCU as a non -profit  for 18 months during the Class Period, which \ndrove higher enrollment and boosted GCE\u2019s profit margins.  ( Id. at \u00b6 2)  In reality, the S AC \nalleges that Defendants Mueller and Bachus omitted or mispresented key terms of the Conversion, such that investors were unable to accurately assess the risk of a DOE denial of \n \n9  The DOE Letter, which is attached as Exhibit A to the SAC, was not made \npublicly available until November 12, 2019.  ( D.I. 60 at \u00b6 249) 17 GCU\u2019s request for non -profit status \u2014even while Defendants understood the real risks  of denial, \ngiven their knowledge of the terms of the Conversion.   ( Id. at \u00b6 3)   \nFor instance, \u201cDefendants knew \u2014but investors did not \u2014that the distinctive terms of \n[the] Conversion were far afield of any other conversion transact ion approved by the DOE[.]\u201d  \n(Id. at \u00b6 8)  Defendants repeatedly sought to reassure investors that the Conversion was very \nsimilar to the Purdue -Kaplan Deal, for example, even though Bachus  had previously been told by \nSolinski that there were \u201c real\u201d and \u201ckey\u201d differences between the two.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10, 21)  \nDefendants  also knew, contrary to public statements, that a post -Conversion GCU would not  be \nactually independent from GCE.  ( Id. at \u00b6 11 , 21)  Rather,  Defendants concealed from the public \nthe fact that , inter alia , 75% of Defendant Mueller\u2019s executive team as P resident of GCU was \nmade up of  GCE employees .  (Id.)  Final ly, Defendants concealed from the public the May 2018 \ninterrogatories  and how the DOE\u2019 s concerns about the Conversion held up a decision on the pre -\nacquisition application , with Mueller instead falsely attributing th e DOE\u2019s  delay to DOE \n\u201c\u2018understaff [ing].\u2019\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 13 ; see also id . at \u00b6 21 )   \nDespite knowing that there was a substantial risk that the DOE would not approve the \nConversion, a risk Defendants concealed from investors, Defendants chose to move forward with \nthe Conversion anyway, in light of the logistical, regulatory and financial benefits (discussed previously) th at this approach provided to them .  See supra  at 11- 12; (see also D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 1 4-\n17). \nIn addition to misrepresenting the structure of and status of the Conversion, Defendants \nare also alleged to have misrepresented  GCE\u2019s financial performance by engaging in accounting \nfraud .  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 18)  Defendants are said to have falsely claimed that a post -Conversion GCU \nwould be a non- profit , despite the fact that GCU would violate the \u201c\u2018most basic tenet of 18 nonprofit status.\u2019\u201d  ( Id.)  This allowed Defendant s to \u201ctreat [ the new ] GCU as an improper off-\nbalance -sheet entity \u2014which [GCE] then used to hide expenses and costs while retaining a \ndisproportionate amount of revenue, thereby inflating [GCE\u2019s] financial results.\u201d  ( Id.)  \nThe SAC alleges that o nce the DOE denied Defendants\u2019  attempt to have GCU classified \nas a non -profit entity, Defendants \u2019 misstatements and omissions came to light.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 19 -20)  \nGCE\u2019s inflated stock price plummeted  thereafter, all at the expense of Defendants\u2019 investors and \nshareho lders . \nAt issue in the briefing on the Motion are P laintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding:  (1) the types \nof false and /or misleading statements and omissions that allegedly fueled the scheme; (2) facts \ndemonstrat ing that Defendants  acted with  the requisite scienter; and (3) facts regarding loss \ncausation.  Below the Court summarizes the SAC \u2019s additional allegations r elating to these issues.  \n1. False and Misleading Statements and Omissions  \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants made five  types of relevant, actionable false and \nmisleading statements and /or omissions , (id. at \u00b6 264):  (1) Defendants misrepresented GCU\u2019s \npurported independence from GCE , in statements made  before  the Conversion, ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 265-\n77); (2) Defendants misrepresented the ris ks of DOE denial of  the request for non- profit status \nfor GCU , (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 278- 83); (3) Defendants misrepresented GCU\u2019s purported independence from \nGCE , in statements made  after  the Conversion, ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 284- 95); (4) Defendants misrepresented \nthe Conversion\u2019s similarity to other transactions, ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 2 96-309);  and (5) Defendants \nmisrepresented GCE\u2019s accounting and compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting \nPrinciples (or \u201c GAAP \u201d), (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 310- 18).  These specific allegations  are discussed f urther \nbelow. 19 a. Statements About GCU\u2019s Purported Independence from GCE \nMade Before the Conversion  \nThe S AC alleges that from January 5, 2018 (when GCE announced the  Conversion) \nthrough to the Conversion\u2019s closing, Defendants made false and misleading claim s about GCE \u2019s \nseparateness or independence from GCU.  ( Id. at \u00b6 265)  These include the following:  \n\u2022 The S AC alleges that Defendants stated that the new GCU \nwould operate as a \u201cnon -profit\u201d and a \u201cseparate non -profit \nentity[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 266- 67, 270, 271 (internal quotation marks \nand emphasis omitted))  These statements are alleged to have been materially false and misleading because \u201cthe planned \nstructure of [] GCU violated \u2018the most basic tenet\u2019 of a non-profit and instead would act to funnel 95% of [GCU\u2019s] revenue \nto GCE, while GCE only had to cover 28% of the institution\u2019s costs\u201d  (hereafter , the \u201c95%/28% revenue/costs imbalance \nissue\u201d).   (Id. at \u00b6 277)    \n \n\u2022 Additionally, the S AC alleges that Defendants stated that the \nnew GCU would be a \u201cseparate\u201d entity  from GCE , that it \nwould utilize \u201cindependent management,\u201d that GCE would \u201cno \nlonger . . . operate a regulated institution of higher education,\u201d that GCE would act as a \u201cthird party\u201d to the new GCU, and that \u201cGCU\u2019s current faculty, academic leadership and related staff \nand other employees  . . . would become employed by [the new] \nGCU[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 267, 270-71, 273 (internal quotation marks \nand emphasis omitted))  These statements are said to have been materially false and misleading because they \u201cmisstated and omitted  . . . that 41 members of the university\u2019s 58- member \nExecutive Leadership Team were employed by GCE , that \nsignificant members of [ new] GCU\u2019s academic leadership were \nemployed by GCE, and that numerous other operationally-significant GCU employees became employees of GCE  while \nperforming the same responsibilities for [the new] GCU as  they \nhad previously\u201d  (hereafter, the \u201chigh percentage of GCE \nemployees that oversaw the work of GCU\u201d).  ( Id. at \u00b6 274)    \n \nb. Risks of DOE Denial  of Non -profit Status  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, after GCE received the May 2018 interrogatories, Defendants \nconcealed the DOE\u2019s concerns about the Conversion and misrepresented the prospects of DOE \napproval  of the new GCU as a non -profit .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 125, 278)  To that end, Defendants stated 20 that based on \u201c ongoing engagement \u201d with the DOE about the transaction throughout the revie w \nprocess , GCE \u201c concluded that . . . any regulatory limitations imposed by [the DOE] could be \nmanaged\u201d and that the DOE approval process was taking longer than usual because the DOE was \n\u201cvery understaffed[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 279- 81 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted) ; see \nalso id. at \u00b6\u00b6 134 -35, 336 )   \nPlaintiffs assert that the  statement  that \u201cany regulatory limitations . . . could be managed\u201d \nwas materially false and misleading  (1) because it  omitted  that the DOE had propounded the \nMay 2018 interrogatories ; (2) in light of the material terms of the agreements between GCE and \nGCU; (3) due to other key information known by GCE officers and directors ; and (4) in light of  \nthe new GCU\u2019s lack of independenc e under the proposed structure of the Conversion\u2014all of \nwhich \u201crais[ed] a significant risk that the DOE would decline the Conversion or otherwise \nimpose disabling conditions.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 283 )  The SAC also alleges that the \u201cunderstaffing\u201d \nstatement was mat erially false and misleading for the additional reason that \u201c[ GCE ] itself \nacknowledged that its only communications with the DOE in May 2018, when [GCE] made the decision to abandon the pre [-]approval process, related to the interrogatories themselves, not to \nany staffing concerns.\u201d  ( Id.)  Moreover, Defendants did not disclose to investors that GCE \nreceived three additional sets of requests for information from the DOE , or that the DOE had \npreviously informed Defendants in connection with the 2014 Conversion that it was unlikely to approve the Conversion\u2019s structure.  ( Id.) \nc. Statements About GCU\u2019s Purported Independence from GCE \nMade After the Conversion  \nPlaintiffs contend that after the Conversion, Defendants misleadingly claimed that GCU \nwas an operationally independent non- profit and that GCE did not control GCU\u2019s day- to-day \noperations.  ( Id. at \u00b6 284)  More specifically:  21 \u2022 The S AC alleges that Defendants made statements that GCE \n\u201cno longer owns and operates a regulated institution of higher \neducation,\u201d that its relationship to the new GCU was \u201c no \nlonger as owner and operator, but as a third[ -]party service \nprovider to an independent customer [,]\u201d and that \u201c[a]side from \nMr. Mueller, no other employee of [GCU] or [GCE] has a dual role in both organizations .\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 285- 86, 288  (internal \nquotations marks and emphasis omitted))  The S AC alleges \nthat these statements were materially false and misleading because they omitted the fact of the high percentage of GCE employees that oversaw the work of GCU.  (Id. at \u00b6 293)   \n \n\u2022 Additionally, the S AC alleges that in this time period , \nDefendants again made statements that the new GCU would be \na \u201cseparate non -profit entity [,]\u201d which were allegedly \nmisleading for the reasons set out previously.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 285 \n(internal  quotation marks and emphasis omitted) , 294) ) \n \n\u2022 Finally, the SAC alleges that in this time period , Defendants \nmade statements that GCU was a \u201cno t-for-profit [,]\u201d which \nwere allegedly misleading for the reasons set out previously.  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 290 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted) , \n295)) \n \nd. The Conversion\u2019s Similarity to Other Transactions  \nPlaintiffs next allege that  throughout the Class Period, Defendants sought to reassure \ninvestors that the Conversion would be approved by the DO E, and that it was structured similarly \nto other transactions that  the DOE had approved like the Purdue -Kaplan Deal .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 99, 296)  \nHowever,  the S AC a sserts that  in reality, the Conversion\u2019s structure  was far different from the \nstructure of the Purdue -Kaplan D eal or to other DOE -approved structures .  (Id. at \u00b6 296; see also \nid. at \u00b6\u00b6 1 82-200) \nMore specifically, the S AC alleges that Defendants made statements that:  (1) the \nConversion was \u201cmainstream\u201d or \u201cvery similar to [,]\u201d \u201ccomparable to [,]\u201d \u201calmost identical to [,]\u201d \nand \u201calmost an identical replica of\u201d the Purdue -Kaplan D eal or services arrangements at \n\u201chundreds\u201d of univer sities around the country; and (2) that \u201c[GCU] has commissioned studies to 22 ensure that the rates and terms of the services arrangement are consistent with market norms[.]\u201d  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 2 97-304 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted))  These statements are \nalleged to have been materially false and misleading  because:   (1) the terms of the Conversion \nwere \u201cunusually and egregiously favorable to [GCE],\u201d in light of the 95%/28% revenue/cost s \nimbalance issue (while in the Purdue -Kaplan Deal, Kaplan was to receive only a 12.5% services \nfee related to the provision of academic services, and only after Purdue Global , the online \nuniversity, had reached breakeven status) , (id. at \u00b6 306) ; (2) a  high percentage of GCE employees \nwould oversee the work of GCU  (unlike the Purdue -Kaplan Deal, where there was no \noverlapping leadership between the two entities) , (id. at \u00b6 307) ; and (3) the \u201cConversion resulted \nin an undisclosed, captive relationship betwee n GCE and [GCU ,]\u201d in that the services \narrangement between GC E and GC U had an initial term of 15 years that renewed automatically \nevery 5 years, and GCU could only exit the arrangement  if it satisfied in full an $854 million \nsecured note and pa id an early termination  fee\u2014a ll of which would be essentially impossible for \nGCU t o accomplish given the lopsided revenue share between GCE and GCU  (whereas in the \nPurdue -Kaplan deal, either party could terminate the services agreement after the sixth year for a \ntermination fee of 1.25 times the total revenue of Purdue Global , payable b y way of a promissory \nnote), (id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 308-09; see also id. at \u00b6\u00b6 19 1-99).      \ne. GCE\u2019s Accounting and Compliance with GAAP  \nThe S AC explains that because of GCE\u2019s control over the new GCU, and the fact that \nGCE was the primary beneficiary of GCU\u2019s operations, GCE was \u201crequired to consolidate [the \nnew] GCU into its financial statements . . . or at a minimum to identify [it] as a related  party[.]\u201d  \n(Id. at \u00b6 310; see also id. at \u00b6\u00b6 214- 35)  Had GCE done so during the Class Period, this would \nhave \u201cdramatically decreased [GCE\u2019s] reported margins\u201d and would have given investors a far 23 less optimistic picture of GCE\u2019s operating results than w hat GCE actually presented in that time \nperiod.  ( Id. at \u00b6 214)  Instead, it is alleged that Defendants made a number of materially false \nstatements regarding this subject matter during the Class Period, as follows:  \n\u2022 Defendants stated that the new \u201cGCU is n ot a related party to \n[GCE]\u201d and that \u201cGCU is not a related party to [GCE] in \naccordance with [Accounting Standards Codification, or \u2018ASC\u2019] Topic 850[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 311, 313 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted) )  These statements are alleged to  \nhave been materially false or misleading because the new GCU \u201cwas not a non- profit\u201d and because GCE \u201ccontrolled [the new] \nGCU, making them \u2018affiliates under common control\u2019 and thus related parties for purposes of GAAP.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 316)  The \nstatements also allegedly omitted the material fact of  the high \npercentage of GCE employees that oversaw the work of GCU .  \n(Id.)   \n \n\u2022 Defendants stated that GCE did not have \u201cany off -balance \nsheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on [its ] financial \ncondition[ .]\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 312 (internal quotation marks and \nemphasis omitted) )  This statement is alleged to have been \nfalse or misleading because GCE used the new GCU \u201cas an off-balance sheet entity to which it funneled expenses while \nrecognizing revenues generated by [the new] GCU.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 \n317) \n \n\u2022 Additionally, Defendants stated that GCE\u2019s \u201cresults of operations do not include the operations of GCU but rather reflect the operations of [GCE] as a servi ce/technology \nprovider[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 287  (internal quotation marks omitted) \n(alteration in original))  This statement is alleged to have been false and misleading because GCU\u2019s operations did not so reflect this reality and instead \u201creflected the highly u nusual and \nexploitative control relationship that [GCE] had with [the new GCU.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 317)  \n \n\u2022 Lastly, the S AC alleges that GCE\u2019s reported operating margins \nfrom the third quarter of 2018 through the third quarter of 2019, which showed that operating margins had \u201cgreatly \nincreased year -over-year[,]\u201d (id. at \u00b6 315), were materially \nfalse and misleading because they were \u201cinflated by [GCE\u2019s ] \ntreatment of [the new ] GCU as a separate and unconsolidated 24 entity, which allowed [ GCE ] to report higher margins . . . than \nit would have\u201d under consolidation, ( id. at \u00b6 318). \n \n2. Scienter  \nThe SAC pleads some additional facts (or underscores some facts already pleaded) that \nare said to go particularly to  the issue of scienter.  These include the following: \n\u2022 Defendants had knowledge of the undisclosed, non-public \nterms of the Conversion.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 320-26)  The SAC alleges \nthat Defendants, by virtue of their roles as GCE\u2019s senior leadership, were undoubtedly aware of the terms of the Conversion, as the contractual arrangement between GCE and GCU would change the very nature of GCE.  ( Id. at \u00b6 323)  \nMoreover, Defendants also indicated in filings with the SEC that they had reviewed the MSA  (which included these terms).  \n(Id. at \u00b6 322)  According to the SAC, these facts \u201csupport [] a \nstrong inference that Defendants Mueller and Bachus knew, or were severely reckless in not knowing, about the terms on which the deal was struck, and the false and misleading nature of their statements to investors.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 326)  \n \n\u2022 Defendants  had knowledge that the Conversion differed \nmaterially from the Purdue -Kaplan Deal .  (Id. at \u00b6 32 7)  \nSpecifically, the SAC highlights the allegation that Solinski, who was responsible for reviewing the Purdue-Kaplan D eal at \nHLC, had told Defendants that the re were \u201c\u2018 real\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018key \u2019\u201d \ndifferences between their deal and the Purdue- Kaplan  Deal .  \n(Id.) \n \n\u2022 Defendants had knowledge of the overlapping members of the \nexecutive team leading GCE and GCU .  (Id. at \u00b6 328) \n \n\u2022 The DOE re peatedly indicated to Defendants that it was \nscrutinizing the Conversion closely  by:  (1) telling Mueller and \nBachus that it would review the proposed structure of the 2014 Conversion, which was the same structure as the Conversion, \nwith extreme skepticism; ( 2) propounding the May 2018 \ninterrogatories, which indicated that the \u201cDOE was unexpectedly probing the underlying structure of the transaction\u201d; and (3) requesting additional information on July 3, 2018, August 24, 2018 and  September 10, 2018.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n332-39)  The SAC alleges that based on these facts, \u201cDefendants Mueller and Bachus knew, or were severely 25 reckless in not knowing, that there was an enhanced and \nundisclosed risk of the DOE denying [the n ew] GCU\u2019s \napplication for non- profit status.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 339)   \n \n\u2022 Defendants moved forward with the Conversion \nnotwithstanding the heightened undisclosed risks because of  \nthe various logistical, regulatory and financial benefits (discussed previously) this approach provided to them.  See supra at 11-12; (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 340 -45). \n \n3. Loss Causation \nThe SAC also pleads some additional facts relevant to loss causation .  It asserts that the \ntruth concealed by Defendants\u2019 misrepresentations and omissions was disclosed to the market in \ntwo stages.  After each disclosure, the price of GCE\u2019s common stock \u201cfell precipitously[.] \u201d  (Id. \nat \u00b6 349)   \nThe first disclosure came via the November 6/7, 2019 announcements.  ( Id.)  After the \nmarket closed on November 6, 2019, Defendants (who had just learned from the DOE that it had rejected GCU\u2019s application for non-profit status) disclosed that fact on an earnings call.  ( Id. at \u00b6  \n351)  Then, on November 7, 2019, before the market opened, Defendants filed a Form 8- K \ndetailing that the DOE had rejected GCU\u2019s  non-profit application .  (Id.)  This disclosure is \nalleged to have caused GCE\u2019s stock price to fall by -7.61% to $84.89.  ( Id.) \nThe second disclosure was on January 28, 2020.  ( Id. at \u00b6 349)  Before the mar ket opened \non that date, Citron published the C itron Report.  ( Id. at \u00b6  351)  The additional disclosures in that \nreport are alleged to have caused GCE\u2019s stock price to fall by -8.12% to $84.07.  ( Id.) \nThe S AC alleges that these declines in GCE\u2019s stock pric e were \u201ca direct and proximate \nresult of Defendants\u2019 scheme being revealed to investors and to the market.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 352)  And \nit also asserts that \u201cthe timing and magnitude of [GCE\u2019s] stock price declines negate[] any inference that the economic losses and damages suffered by [] Plaintiffs . . . were caused by 26 changed market conditions, macroeconomic factors, or even [GCE]- specific facts unrelated to \nDefendants\u2019 fraudulent conduct.\u201d  ( Id.) \nD. Procedural History of the Case and Defendants\u2019 Motion  \nThis consol idated securities class action arises out of two class action C omplaints filed in \nthis Court on May 12, 2020, (D.I. 1), and on June 12, 2020, (Civil Action No. 20-801- MN, D.I. \n1), respectively .  On August 13, 2020, U nited States District Judge Maryellen Noreika \nconsolidated the two cases in the instant action and appointed Colorado FPPA and Oakland \nCounty to serve as Lead Plaintiffs in this suit on behalf of themselves and others.10  (D.I. 28 at 1-\n2)   \nOn October 15, 2020, Judge Noreika ordered that the cases be referred to the Court to \nhear and resolve all pre-trial matters, up to and including the resolution of expert discovery matters.  (D.I. 32)  Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 20, 2020 ( the \u201cCAC\u201d ), (D.I. \n34), which Defendants moved to dismiss on December 21, 2020 (the \u201cfirst motion to dismiss\u201d) , \n(D.I. 36).  At the parties \u2019 joint request, the Court did not enter a case schedule at that time.  (D.I. \n41)  Instead\u2014 and again a t the parties\u2019 joint request\u2014the Court heard oral argument on the first \nmotion to dismiss on May 26, 2021.  (D.I. 47)  Thereafter, on August 9, 2021, the Court issued a Report and Recommendation granting the first motion to dismiss in its entirety (the \u201cfirst R&R\u201d).  (D.I. 50)  After neither party filed objections, Judge Noreika adopted the first R&R on \nAugust 23, 2021; Judge Noreika permitted Plaintiffs to file a further amended complaint to correct the deficiencies outlined in the first R&R .  (D.I. 54)  \n \n10  When this Report and Recommendation refers herein to \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d it is thus \nreferring to Lead Plaintiffs and those whom they purport to represent. 27  Plaintiffs filed a furth er amended complaint on September 28, 2021, (D.I. 55), which they \nthereafter amended by filing the SAC on January 21, 2022, (D.I. 60).  Defendants then filed the \ninstant Motion on March 15, 2022.  (D.I. 61)  The parties completed briefing on the Motion on June 3, 2022.  (D.I. 68)  At Plaintiffs\u2019 request, (D.I. 69), the Court heard oral argument on the \nMotion on October 25, 2022.  Subsequent to that, P laintiffs filed a n additional motion asking that \nthe Court take judicial notice of certain statements when resolving the Motion (the \u201cmotion for judicial notice\u201d) , (D.I. 76); briefing on the motion for judicial notice was completed on January \n19, 2023, (D.I. 79).\n11 \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA. Rule 12(b)(6) and a Motion to Dismiss  for Failure to State a Claim \nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint based on \nthe failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  W hen \npresented with such a motion, a court typically conducts a two -part analysis.  Fowler v. UPMC \nShadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009).  First, the court separates the factual and legal \nelements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the complaint\u2019s well-pleaded facts as true, but [disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d  Id.  at 210-11.  Second, the court determine s \u201cwhether the \nfacts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a \u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d  Id.  at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009)).  \u201cA claim has facial \nplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  In \n \n11  The Court ORDERS that the motion for judicial notice is DENIED as MOOT.  \nThat is because even were the Court to decline to consider the statements that Plaintiffs want it to \ntake judicial notice of, P laintiffs would still prevail as to  the instant Motion.  \n 28 assessing the plausibility of a claim, the court must \u201c\u2018construe the complaint in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u2019\u201d  Fowler , 578 F.3d at 210 (quoting Phillips v. Cty. of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008)).\n12 \nB. Special Pleading R equirements for Securities Fraud Allegations  \n1. Section 10(b) \nIn connection with the \u201cpurchase or sale of any security[,]\u201d Section 10(b) prohibits the \n\u201cuse or employ . . . [of] any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [ SEC] may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public \ninterest or for the protection of investors.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (\u201cSection 10(b)\u201d).  Pursuant to its statutory authority, the SEC promulgated Rule 10b-5, which \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d makes it \u201cunlawful . . . [t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading[.]\u201d  17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b- 5 (\u201cRule \n10b-5\u201d).  \u201cThe courts have implied from these statutes and Rule [10b- 5] a private damages \naction, which resembles, but is not identical to, common- law tort actions for deceit and \nmisrepresentat ion.\u201d  Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341 (2005).  According to the \nSupreme Court of the United States, the elements of a Section 10(b) claim are:  \n(1) a material misrepresentation (or omission) . . .[;] (2) scienter, \ni.e., a wrongful state of mind . . .[;] (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security. . .[;] (4) reliance, often referred to in \n \n12   In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a district court typically considers only the \nallegations of the complaint, the exhibits attached thereto, documents or facts that are incorporated by reference into the complaint or that are otherwise integral to the complaint\u2019s allegations, matters of public record and items for which the Court can take judicial notice.  See, e.g., Illumina, Inc. v. Guardant Health, Inc ., Civil Action No. 22-334- GBW -CJB, 2023 W L \n1407716, at *3 n.3 (D. Del. Jan. 31, 2023). 29 cases involving public securities markets (fraud -on-the-market \ncases) as \u201ctransaction causation \u201d . . . [;] (5) economic loss . . . [;] \nand (6)  \u201closs causation,\u201d i.e., a causal connection between the \nmaterial misrepresentation and the loss [.] \nId. at 341- 42 (emphasis and citations omitted); see also In re Newell Brands, Inc. Sec . Litig. , 837 \nF. App\u2019x 869, 874 (3d Cir. 2020).  \na. Heightened pleading re quirements for Section 10(b) claims  \nThe analysis of a pleading in a  securities fraud action \u201crequires more than mere reference \nto the conventional standard applicable to motions under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d  In re Rockefeller Ctr. \nProps., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 215 (3d Cir. 2002).  For example, in the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), Congress raised the pleading standards for the first two Section 10(b) elements :  material misrepresentation (or omission) and scienter.  Institutional \nInvs. Grp. v. Avaya, Inc., 564 F.3d 242, 252- 53 (3d Cir. 2009).  With regard to a material \nmisrepresentation or omission, \u201cthe complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been \nmisleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regar ding \nthe statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u- 4(b)(1)(B); see also \nAvaya , 564 F.3d at 252- 53.  With regard to scienter, \u201cthe compla int shall . . . state with \nparticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u- 4(b)(2)(A); see also Avaya , 564 F.3d at 253.  \nb. Rule 9(b) considerations  \n\u201cIn addition to the PSLRA [ misrepresentation/omission  and scienter] requirements, \nplaintiffs alleging fraud under the Exchange Act must also comply with the heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b).\u201d  In re Suprema Specialties, Inc. Sec. Litig., 438 F.3d 256, 276 (3d Cir. \n2006) (c itation omitted); see also Newell Brands , 837 F. App\u2019x at 874.  According to Rule 9(b), 30 a party alleging fraud or mistake \u201cmust state with particularity the circumstances constituting \nfraud or mistake.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  \u201cRule 9(b) requires, at a minimum, that plaintiffs support their allegations of [Section 10(b)] securities fraud with all of the essential factual background that would accompany \u2018the first paragraph of any newspaper story\u2019\u2014that is, the \u2018who, what, when, where and how\u2019 of the events a t issue.\u201d  In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. \nSec. Litig., 311 F.3d at 217 (citation omitted). \nFor the most part, the PSLRA\u2019s particularity requirement harmonizes with Rule 9(b).  \nThat is, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has concluded that \u201cRule 9(b)\u2019s \nparticularity requirement \u2018is comparable to and effectively subsumed by the requirements of . . . \nthe PSLRA.\u2019\u201d  Avaya , 564 F.3d at 253 (citation omitted).   \nHowever, the PSLRA\u2019s requirement for pleading scienter \u201cmarks a sharp break with Rule \n9(b),\u201d id., because Rule 9(b) allows plaintiffs to plead scienter generally, Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  \nThus, \u201c[t]o the extent that Rule 9(b)\u2019s allowance of general pleading with respect to mental state \nconflicts with the PSLRA\u2019s requirement that plaintiffs state with particularity facts giving rise to \na strong inference that the defendant acted with scienter . . . the PSLRA \u2018supersedes Rule 9(b) as \nit relates to Rule 10b -5 actions.\u2019\u201d  Suprema Specialties , 438 F.3d at 277 (citation omitted); see \nalso Local 731 I.B. of T. Excavators & Pavers Pension Tr. Fund v. Swanson, Civil Action No. \n09-799, 2011 WL 2444675, at *5 (D. Del. June 14, 2011).  \n2. Section 20(a) \nSection 20(a) of the Exchange Act provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[e]very person who, \ndirectly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule \nor regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as \nsuch controlled person[.]\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a) (\u201cSection 20(a)\u201d).  This \u201ccreates a cause of action 31 against individuals who exercise control over a \u2018controlled person,\u2019 including a corporation, who \nhas committed a [S]ection 10(b) violation.\u201d  City of Edinburgh Council v. Pfizer, Inc., 754 F.3d \n159, 177 (3d Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  \u201cAccordingly, liability under Section 20(a) is \nderivative of an underlying violation of Section 10(b) by the controlled person.\u201d  Avaya , 564 \nF.3d at 252.13 \nIII. DISCUS SION  \nDefendants challenge the SAC\u2019s allegations on three grounds:  (1) failure to sufficiently \nplead scienter, (D.I. 62 at 4-15); (2) failure to sufficiently allege actionable false or misleading \nstatements  or omissions, ( id. at 15-19) ; and (3) failure to sufficiently plead  loss causation, ( id. at \n19-20).  The Court will begin by addressing whether Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged  falsity, then \nwill move to consider whether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged scienter, and finally, whether Plaintiffs \nplausibly alleged loss causation. \nA. Material False or Misleading S tatements and /or Omissions  \nDefendants challenge the sufficiency of the following alleged false or misleading \nstatements and/or omissions:  (1) Statements regarding GCU\u2019s purported independence, ( id. at \n15-16); (2) statements rega rding the risks to GCU\u2019s non-profit label, ( id. at 16 -17); (3) \nstatements regarding the DOE\u2019s review of the Conversion, ( id. at 17 -18); (4) statements \n \n13  Thus, because Mueller and Bachus are alleged to have exercised control over \nGCE during the relevant period, as the parties do, the Court will consider the Section 20(a) \nallegations to rise and fall with the merit of the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 allegations.  (D.I. 62 at 20 n.24)  \n 32 regarding the Conversion\u2019s similarity to other approved transactions, ( id. at 18) ; and (5) \nstatements regarding GCE\u2019s compliance with GAAP, ( id. at 18 -19).14  \n Again, to plead the element of material misrepresentation or omission pursuant to Rule \n10b-5\n, a plaintiff must \u201cspecif y each allegedly misleading statement, the reason or reasons why \nthe statement is misleading, and, if an allegation is made on information and belief, all facts supporting that belief with particularity. \u201d  Avaya , 564 F.3d at  259 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-\n4(b)(1)).  A misstatement or omission is material if there is \u201c \u2018a substantial likelihood that the \n[misstatement or] disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable \ninvestor as having significantly altered the \u2018 total mix \u2019 of information made \navailable. \u2019\u201d  See Basic  Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S.  224, 231-32 (1988)  (citation omitted) .   \nAn alleged misstatement or omission concerning a fact already made publicly available \ncannot be materially misleading.

The first and third of those \nfive categories were similar, in that both of them related to statements made about GCU\u2019s purported independence from GCE (with the first category relating to statements made before the \nConversion and the third relating to statements made after the Conversion).  Here in this part of \ntheir Motion, Defendants are essentially challenging all five of those categories of statements/omissions.  (D.I. 62 at 15)  Defendants\u2019 first two challenges (regarding statements about GCU\u2019s purported independence and statements about the risks to GCU\u2019s non- profit label) \nare generally related to the SAC\u2019s categories one and three; Defendants\u2019 other three challenges are related to the SAC\u2019s  categories two, four and five.   33 matter was known already and had been factored into the market price.\u201d  Winer , 2004 WL \n2203709, at *4 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \nAs to omissions, there is no affirmative duty to disclose material facts, but \u201c[o]nce a \ncompany has chosen  to speak on an issue\u2014even an issue it had no independent obligation to \naddress \u2014it cannot omit material facts related to that issue so as to make its disclosure \nmisleading .\u201d  Allegheny Cty.

Stafford, 226 F.3d 275, 285-86 (3d  Cir. \n2000) . \nThe Court will now address Defendants\u2019 challenge to the SAC\u2019s allegations of false or \nmisleading statements and/or omissions.  It will take up the five categories of statements cited by \nDefendants in turn. \n1. Statements R egarding GCU\u2019s Purported Independence from GCE  \nAt issue first is the SAC\u2019s allegations that Defendants  made the following false or \nmaterially misleading statements or omissions regarding GCU\u2019s independence from GCE:  (1) \nthat GCE would no longer own GCU, but would be a \u201cseparate\u201d entity from GCU and act as a \u201cthird  party\u201d service provider  thereto ; (2) that GCU\u2019s \u201cfaculty, academic leadership and related \nstaff and other employees\u201d would be employed by GCU, not GCE; and (3) that aside from Mueller, no other employee would have a \u201cdual role\u201d at GCE and GCU.  (D.I. 62 at 15-16) ; see \nalso supra Section I.C.1(a) & (c).  Defendants make various arguments for dismissal of these allegations, but the Court finds the m to be unavailing. 34 Defendants\u2019 main argument is that the DOE\u2019s decision (as reflected in the DOE Letter) \ndoes not indicate that these statements  are false or misleading.  For instance, in response to the \n\u201cdual role\u201d allegation , Defendants argued that the DOE Letter states that 75% of the 58- person  \n\u201c\u2018executive team members responsible for managing and overseeing GCU and developing its \nstrategic vision are employed by its service provider  [i.e., GCE].\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 62 at 16 (quoting D.I. \n60, ex. A at 16) (emphasis added) ; see also D.I. 68 at 10)  According to Defendants, s ince the \nDOE Letter sa ys that team members  at issue were formally  employed by GCE (not by both GCE \nand GCU), then the statement that no GCE e mployee other than Mueller  had a \u201cdual role\u201d with \nboth institutions was not false or misleading.  (D.I. 62 at 16)   \nThe Court, however, agrees with Plaintiffs that such an argument misses the point.  (D.I. \n66 at 8)  The SAC\u2019s allegations are that, under the terms of the Conversion, approximately 75% of the \u201cExecutive Leadership Team\u201d that was \u201cresponsible for managing and overseeing [GCU]\u201d (i.e., \u201cmost of [GCU\u2019s] key management personnel\u201d) were employed by GCE.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 177 (internal quotations marks omitted) , 274-75, 293; see also id . at \u00b6\u00b6 229, 307).  And the SAC \nfurther alleges that \u201csignificant members of [] GCU\u2019s academic leadership were employed by GCE, and that numerous other operationally- significant GCU employees became employees of \nGCE while performing the same responsibilities for [] GCU as they had  [before the \nConversion.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 27 4; see also id . at \u00b6\u00b6 178, 293, 307)\n15  Just because these GCE \n \n15   To the extent Defendants argue that these allegations fail to meet the PSLRA\u2019s \npleading standard because Plaintiffs do not \u201cattempt to identify th[e]se purported members of  \nthe University\u2019s academic leader ship\u201d by name, (D.I. 62 at 16), the Court disagrees.  Defendants \ncite to no similar decision that requires a plaintiff to provide a laundry list of names in such  \ncircumstances.  And t he SAC pro vides some le vel of identification of these employees\u2019 roles .  \nMoreover, in two instance s, the SAC identif ies certain exemplary  former GCU academic \nexecutives by their new GCE title.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 178) \n 35 employees were not also formally employed by GCU does not necessarily mean they did not \nhave a key \u201crole\u201d at GCU \u2014especially if, as alleged, their job duties required that they be a part \nof GCU\u2019s leadership group.  Indeed, the DOE Letter itself concluded that \u201c[g]iven the enormous leverage GCE now has over [GCU] by virtue of the . . . fact that most of [GCU\u2019s] key management personnel work for GCE, not [GCU], . . . [GCU] is not the entity actually operating [GCU].\u201d  ( Id., ex. A at 16 (emphasis omitted))  This certainly could suggest that the DOE \nbelieved there to be numerous individuals who held \u201cdual roles \u201d at GCE and GCU.   At a \nminimum, Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u201cdual role\u201d in this context (i.e., as referencing a person \nwho has significant oversight or functional responsibilities with two entities, and not necessarily a person who is employed or paid by both entities ) was a reasonable one; at the pleading stage, \nthat is all that is needed.\n16  See IWA Forest Indus. Pension Plan v. Textron, Inc., 14 F.4th 141, \n147 (2d Cir. 2021); City of Warren Police & Fire Retirement Sys. v. World Wrestling Ent. Inc ., \n477 F. Supp. 3d 123, 129-30 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). \n \n16   Defendants  also assert that it was publicly disclosed that GCE employees would \nplay a \u201crole\u201d at GCU \u2014in that the public was alerted that GCE would operate as a third -party \nservice provider to GCU following the Conversion.  (D.I. 68 at 10-11)  But it seems pretty clear \nthat Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation here is that the type of \u201crole\u201d being referenced in Defendants\u2019 public \nstatements  (i.e., being a third-party service provider) is something less significant than the type \nof leadership \u201c roles \u201d that  many GCE employees actually played at GCU post-Conversion.  In \nother words, Plaintiffs are alleging that Defendants\u2019 reference to \u201cdual role\u201d connotes a person who works for one entity (i.e., GCE) but also is a part of the team that helps to manage or lead another entity (i.e., GCU) \u2014and that this concept is not captured by simply alerting the public \nthat GCE would be a third-party service provider to GCU.  Indeed, Defendants themselves must have had in mind a more robust definition of \u201cdual role\u201d than  a term describing someone who \nworks for a company that provides services to another company.  Had they not, they would not have said in the July 2, 2018 8-K that only Mueller would have a \u201cdual role\u201d at  both GCE and \nGCU.  (D.I. 63, ex. 5 at 5)  As noted above, the real dispute here is over what \u201cdual role\u201d actually conveys to a reader.  And that is an issue of fact not well decided at the pleading stage.   36 Defendants also pointed to a statement in the DOE Letter to the effect that post -\nConversion, GCU \u201c\u2018 outsource[s] \u2019\u201d a significant number of \u201c\u2018 institutional functions \u2019\u201d to GCE ; it \nclaims that th e DOE\u2019s use of this \u201coutsource\u201d language means that  the DOE  felt that these \nfunctions were being performed by a \u201cseparate\u201d entity that was in  fact a \u201cthird -party\u201d as to GCU \n(i.e., GCE) .  (D.I. 62 at 15- 16 (quoting D.I. 60 at \u00b6 275); see also  D.I. 60, ex. A at 16)  But \nPlaintiffs  are alleging t hat regard less of w hether GCU and GCE were distinct c orporate entities \non paper, the  two had such a close relationship that it was misleading to call them \u201c separate,\u201d  \nindependent entities .  And the DOE\u2019s use of the word \u201coutsource \u201d does not render this assertion  \nimplausible.  This is corroborated when one re ads the surrounding portion of the relevant \nstatement  from the DOE Letter:   \nThe [DOE] is skeptical that any nonprofit could outsource the \nnumber and type of institutional functions that [GCU] has and still be deemed to operate the [ i]nstitution.   \nGiven the  enormous leverage \nGCE now has over [GCU]  by virtue of the MSA and the fact that \nmost of the  [GCU\u2019s] key management personnel work for GCE, not \n[]GCU, the [D OE] concludes that, as a practical matter, [GCU]  is not \nthe entity actually operating the [i] nstitution as  is required under the \n[DOE] \u2019s regulations.  \n (D.I. 60, ex. A at 16 (emphasis in original) ; see also  D.I. 60 at \u00b6 177)   Thus, in the DOE Letter, \nthe DOE seems like it is basically making the same allegation that Plaintiffs make in the SAC:  \nthat the idea that GCE and GCU are \u201cseparate\u201d entities is misleading, if not outright false. \n Finally, Defendants argue that the facts underlying the statements at issue were publicly \navailable and thus cannot be said to be misleading.  (D.I. 62 at 16)  More specifically, Defendants assert that \u201c[GCU\u2019s] purported lack of independence [ was] repeatedly disclosed to \nthe market, including in detailed descriptions of the services provided under the parties\u2019 MSA.\u201d  (Id.)  The Court rejects th is argument, because Defendants  made no real effort to explain how or \nwhere the  facts unde rlying Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in this regard were publicly available.  In 37 support of their assertion, Defendants c ited only to one page of the July 2, 2018 8- K (and even \nthen, they did not point to any particular wording on that page) .  (Id. at 16 n.17 (citing D.I. 63, \nex. 5 at 4) )  As far as the Court can tell, to the extent th at this page discloses anything relevant , it \nprovides only part of the picture.  For instance, while the  document  notes that Mueller would \nserve as both CEO of GCE and President of the new GCU, it also states that \u201c[a]side from Mr. \nMueller, no other employee of [ n]ew GCU or GCE has a dual role in both organizations.\u201d  (D.I. \n63, ex. 5 at 5)  Yet as discussed above , the Court believes Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged why \nsuch a statement c ould, at the very least, mis lead investors.  And this page of the  July 2, 2018 8-\nK does not make any reference, for example, to  the fact that (as Plaintiffs allege) 75% of GCU\u2019s \nExecutive Leadership Team was employed by GCE  post -Conversion.  (D.I. 66 at 11 n.9)   \nFor these reasons, P laintiffs have plausibly alleged that this first category of statements \nwas false or misleading . \n2. Statements Regarding Risks to GCU\u2019s Non -Profit Label  \nAt issue next are the SAC \u2019s allegations that Defendants made misstatements  regarding \nGCU\u2019 s status when Defendants stated that  following the Conversion, GCU would be a \u201cnon -\nprofit\u201d  or a \u201cnon- profit  entity. \u201d  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6  275, 277)  see also supra Section  I.C.1(a) & (c).  \nAccording to the SAC, such statements were false or misleading because the DOE later n oted \nthat it was \u201cskeptical that any nonprofit could outsource the number and type of institutional functions that [GCU] has and still be deemed to operate the institution[,]\u201d ( id. at \u00b6 275), and that \nthe planned structure of GCU violated \u201cthe most basic tenet\u201d of a non -profit, ( id. at \u00b6 277).  \nDefendants \u2019 statements at issue here were made in SEC filings or in an earnings call in the first \nhalf of 2018\u2014i.e. , well prior to the DOE\u2019s 2019 decision on the Conversion.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 266 -67, \n270-71) 38 Defendants challenge these allegations  in two ways.  First they argue that the statements \nwere true at the time Defendants made them because GCU was  recognized as a non- profit  entity  \nby, inter alia , the IRS.  (D.I. 62 at 16-17)17  And second, they assert that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations \nrely on the DOE\u2019s subsequent 2019 decision to establish falsity; that is, that Plaintiffs\u2019  \nallegations do not show how the statements  at issue  were false when they were made in 2018.  \n(Id. at 17 )   \nAs to the first argument, it is true that at the time these statements were made, the IRS \nhad recognized GCU as a non -profit  (having done so back in October 2015).  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 145)  \nYet while this  fact may be helpful to Defendants \u2019 case at the proof stage, it does not negate the \nplausibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.  At a minimum, this is so because  Plaintiffs allege that the \nstructure of the Conversion was set out in certain key documents (such as the MSA or the \nanalyses conducted by Barclays and Deloitte), which were not negotiated and finalized until \n2018.  ( Id.)  Therefore, the IRS obviously did not have these documents in 2015 when it made its \ndecision with regard to GCU\u2019s non-profit status.  ( Id.)  And importantly, Plaintiffs also allege \nthat the details that help demonstrate why it is  that GCU would not actually be a non- profit \norganization post-Conversion w ere located in these very same documents\u2014again, documents \nthat Defendants would have known that the IRS had never reviewed .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 233, 249; see \nalso id., ex. A at 14-15)   \n \n17   In their briefing, Defendants also assert that other \u201cstate licensing authorities . . . \nstate and local tax authorities, the State of Arizona, and the NCAA\u201d had also deemed GCU a \nnon-profit organization as of the time of these statements .  (D.I. 62 at 17 (citing D.I. 48, ex. 2 at \n26))  The Court has looked and cannot locate the record source for Defendants\u2019 assertion in this regard.  Above, then, the Court will simply address the issue with regard to the IRS\u2019s prior 2015 recognition of GCU as a non-profit organization (a fact that is of record).  39 With regard to the second argument, it is true that in \u201c alleging falsity, a plaintiff cannot \nrely on conjecture based on subsequent events, but should instead cite contemporaneous \nsources.\u201d  In re Newell Brands , 837 F. App\u2019x at  875 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted) .  But the Court does not read Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations here as relying on the DOE\u2019s 2019 \ndetermination in order to establish that Defendants\u2019 \u201cnon- profit\u201d statements were knowingly \nfalse or misleading when made in early 2018.  Instead, the SAC pleads that when they made \nthese statements  in 2018, Defendants knew non- public facts about the struc ture of GCU post -\nConversion that would undercut the assertion that GCU would truly be a non- profit.  (D.I. 66 at \n11 (citing D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 172- 205)) \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that this second category of \nstatements was false or mi sleading. \n3. Statements Regarding the DOE\u2019s Review of the Conversion  \nThe SAC alleges  several misstatements regarding the scope  and risks  of the DOE review, \nincluding:  (1) a July 2, 2018 statement t hat GCE had \u201congoing engagement\u201d with the DOE and \nthat \u201cany r egulatory limitations imposed by [the DOE] could be managed[,]\u201d (D.I 60 at  \u00b6\u00b6 279-\n80 (emphasis omitted) ); (2) a July 2, 2018 statement that the DOE\u2019s decision was delayed \nbecause \u201c[the DOE is] very understaffed[,]\u201d ( id. at \u00b6 281 (emphasis omitted )); and (3) a July 2, \n2018 statement that Mueller \u201cwould be very surprised, based on our discussions with [the DOE], if there were [any restrictions,]\u201d ( id. at  \u00b6 282 (emphasis added) ).  See also supra Section I.C.1(b) .  \nPlaintiffs argue that these statements were false or misleading because by that point :  (1) \nDefendants had not had any real e ngagement with the DOE other than having received the May \n2018 interrogatories ; (2) Defendants knew that the DOE\u2019s delay in addre ssing the  application \nwas not due to understaffing; and (3) Defendants knew that due to the content of the 40 interrogatories  and for other reasons, there was a significant risk that the DOE would not grant \nGCU non -profit status.   (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 \u00b6 121-22, 283)   \nIt is easy to see how at least certain of these statements are plausibly alleged to be false \nand/or misleading.  For example, Mueller\u2019s July 2018 statement that the DOE was taking longer \nthan usual with its pre -acquisition a pplication review because the agency was \u201cvery \nunderstaffed\u201d is clearly and understandably alleged to be flatly false  (the SAC calls it a \u201cblatant \nlie[]\u201d) .  (Id. at \u00b6 13)  This is because the SAC asserts th at:  (1) the DOE had never said this to \nMueller, and (2) t he reason the review had not yet concluded was not due to understaffing, but \ninstead to t he many questions DOE had about the Conversion (reflected in the May 2018 \ninterrogatories).  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 281, 283; see also  D.I. 66 at 12)  And Defendants\u2019 statement about \ntheir \u201congoing engagement\u201d with the DOE as of July 2018 is plausibly alleged to have been at least misleading \u2014since the SAC assert s that the only contact that Defendants had had with the  \nDOE as of Ju ly 2018 was that it received the May 2018 interrogatories.  ( D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 279, 283; \nsee also  D.I. 66 at 11- 12)   \nAs for statements or omissions going to the risk  that the DOE would not approve the \nConversion, Defendants argue that these  allegations are not plausibly false or misleading.  They \nclaim that in order to viably allege otherwise, the SAC would have had to separately state that it was unusual  for the DOE to propound discovery requests like the May 2018 interrogatories  \nduring a pre- acquisition application review, o r that the SAC would need to allege that the DOE \nhad told GC U that it was \u201clikely to deny\u201d the request for non- profit status .  (D.I. 62 at 17- 18; D.I. \n68 at 13)  The Court disagrees.  E ven without those types of allegations, the SAC includes \nenough information to allow the reader to understand why, as of May 2018, DOE approval of \nGCU\u2019s non -profit request was in real doubt.  For one thing, the text of the May 2018 41 interrogatories themselves  could suggest as much.  They give th e reader  the firm s ense that the \nDOE was s keptical of GCU\u2019s claim to non -profit status post-Conversion.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 120 \n(DOE, via the interrogatories, questioning whether GCE is a company that does \u201csubstantial \nbusiness\u201d with GCU, and  seeking documents analyzing the \u201cfinancial impact\u201d of the transaction \non GCU) (internal quotation marks omitted))  And the SAC  also alleges that DOE \nrepresentatives had previously suggested skepticism to GCE about a conversion similar to  this \none (i.e., the 2014 Conversion).  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 340)  In light of this, for example, it is plausible \nthat when Mueller  said in July 2018 that he \u201cwould be very surprised, based on our discussions \nwith [the DOE], if there were \u201d any restrictions placed on GCU by DOE , this was a misleading  \nstatement .  And having chosen to speak about DOE review process, Mueller c reated a duty to \ndisclose other details  (like the fact that GCE had actually received the May 2018 interrogatories) \nso that investors would have the full picture.  See Tomaszewski v. Trevena, Inc. , 482 F. Supp. 3d \n317, 331 (E.D. Pa. 2020); In re Celgene Corp. Sec. Lit ig., Civil Action No. 18-4772, 2019 WL \n6909463, at *17 (D.N.J. Dec. 19, 2019); In re Vi ropharma Inc. Sec. Litig., 21 F. Supp. 3d 458, \n471 (E.D. Pa. 2014).18   \nTherefore, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged  this third  category of false and/or \nmisleading statements.  \n \n18   Defendants also argue that \u201cthe non -disclosure of the DOE\u2019s routine information \nrequests does not amount to a material  omission.\u201d  (D.I. 62 at 18 (emphasis in original) ; see also  \nid. at 11 )  But the SAC never asserts that the May 2018 interrogatories were \u201croutine . . . \nrequests [.]\u201d  (Tr. at 115- 16)  And what it does allege about those requests suggest that with them, \nthe DOE was taking a skeptical look at the Conversion.  So the Court cannot assume these \nrequests were \u201croutine\u201d; instead, it must infer what the SAC suggests\u2014that the requests were a real, material problem f or GCE/GCU.   \n 42 4. Statements Regarding the Conversion\u2019s Similarities to the Purdue -\nKaplan Deal  \nNext up are Plaintiffs \u2019 allegations about why it was false and misleading for Defendants \nto tell investors that the terms of the Conversion were similar to  other DOE -approved \ntransactions  such as the Purdue -Kaplan D eal.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 100- 05, 182, 296- 304)  Th e SAC \nalleges that , in reality,  the terms of the Conversion differed materially from the Purdue -Kaplan \nDeal.  This is allegedly  due to the fact that:  (1) the  Conversion involved GCE receiving 95%  of \nGCU\u2019s revenues, while incurring only 28% of total costs  (while in the Purdue -Kaplan Deal, the \nservices provider would be paid only when the non- profit university broke even and would \nreceive only 12 .5% of the non- profit university\u2019s revenue thereafter ), (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 188, 195- 96); (2) \nthe Conversion\u2019s exit and termination fees would have been e ssentially impossible for GCU to \nmanage given the revenue and expense split, effectively tying GCU to GCE in perpetuity ( while  \nin the P urdue -Kaplan Deal, either side could terminate the relationship after the sixth year  for a \nfeasible termination fee ), (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 197 -99); and (3) GCE employed roughly 75% of GCU\u2019s \nExecutive Leadership Team  (while Kaplan and Purdue shared no overlapping executives or \ndirectors ), (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 184, 187; D.I. 66 at 9- 10); see also supra Section I.C.1(d) .   \nThe only challenge t hat Defendants make to the sufficiency of these allegations is to \nassert that they \u201cdisclosed all of the facts that allegedly made those comparisons false or \nmisleading[.]\u201d  (D.I. 62 at 18)  In support, Defendants simply point, without further citation or \nexplanation, to the July 2, 2018 8- K and to a November 8, 2018 Form 10 -Q Quarterly Report  \n(\u201cNovember 8, 2018 10- Q\u201d).  (Id. at 18 n.20)  The Court rejects this half -formed argument.  \nDefendant s do not identify any specific page in these documents that bolsters th e claim that the \ninformation -at-issue  was publicly available .  And the Court cannot be expected to hunt blindly \nfor supporting material in the record that may or may not be there.  Cf . United States v. Dunkel , 43 927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir. 1991) (\u201cJudges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in \nbriefs.\u201d).  \nMoreover, Plaintiffs argued  (and Defendants did not meaningfully rebut) that the  two \ncited documents do not  disclose any of the above-referenced key facts about the Conversion and \nhow it compares to the Purdue- Kaplan Deal .  (D.I. 66 at 10 n.8; see also D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 193)  \nFor instance, the July 2, 2018 8-K states that post-Conversion, GCE would provide services in return for 60%  of GCU\u2019s tuition and fee revenue (not 95%  of revenue).  (D.I. 63, ex. 5 at 3)\n19  \nPlus, Plaintiffs alleged in the SAC that the revenue sources included in GCE\u2019s 60% figure were redacted from view when the MSA was filed publicly in February 2019.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 133)  This \nall indicates that Defendants\u2019 blanket claim \u2014i.e., that the facts that allegedly made these \nmisstatements false were already publicly available\u2014cannot win the day here. \nFor these reason s, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that this fourth category of statements \nwere false or misleading.  \n5. Statements Regarding GCE\u2019s Compliance with GAAP  \nThe S AC alleges that because of GCE\u2019s control over the new GCU, and the fact that \nGCE was the primary ben eficiary of GCU\u2019s operations, GCE was \u201crequired to consolidate [the \nnew] GCU into its financial statements [] or at minimum to identify [it] as a related party[.]\u201d  ( Id. \n \n19  In their briefing, Defendants disagree with the allegation that GCE was to receive \n95% of GCU\u2019s revenues post-Conversion.  (D.I. 68 at 11 n.11)  Defendants say that this claim is \nbelied by the July 2, 2018 8-K \u2019s statement  (referenced above) that GCU agreed to pay just 60% \nof tuition and fee revenue to GCE (and that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim also simply f lies in the face of \n\u201ccommon sense \u201d).  (Id.)  Yet in the DOE L etter, the DOE concluded that when payments on a \nSenior Secured Note were included in the analysis, GCE would, in reality, be receiving roughly 95% of GCU\u2019s total revenues post-Conversion.  (D.I. 60, ex. A at 14)  A s the DOE Letter \nappears to indicate, here the parties simply have a factual dispute about what is the most accurate way to calculate and represent  these numbers.  The Court cannot say Plaintiffs\u2019 side of the story \nis implausible (especially in light of the DOE Letter) .  And so Plaintiffs get the benefit of the \ndoubt at the pleading stage. 44 at \u00b6 310; see also id . at \u00b6\u00b6 214-35)  But the SAC a sserts that Defendants instead made a number \nof material misstatements regarding its GAAP compliance, including, among other things, that \n\u201cGCU is not a related party to [GCE]\u201d and that GCE did not have \u201cany off- balance sheet \narrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a mate rial current or future effect on \n[its] financial condition[.]\u201d  See supra Section  I.C.1(e).   \nIn response, Defendants simply  assert  that these allegations should fail because the \nstatements at issue were not false\u2014in that GCU \u201cwas and is an independent entity following the [Conversion], and was properly treated as such for purposes of GCE\u2019s financials.\u201d  (D.I. 62 at 18-19)  Yet here Defendants are essentially  raising a factual dispute about whether GCE (in light \nof the role its executives are alleged to have played in overseeing GCU post-Conversion) \u201ccontrolled\u201d the new GCU  or whether GCU was in reality an \u201c\u2018off- balance sheet \u2019\u201d entity vis-\u00e0-\nvis GCE (in light of, inter alia , the 95%/28% revenue/costs imbalance issue).  ( See, e.g., D.I. 60 \nat \u00b6\u00b6 316 -17)  And above in Section III.A.1, the Court has already concluded that the SAC \nplausibly alleges that GCU was not, in fact, independent from GCE for many of the same reasons.  (D.I. 68 at 13 (Defendants acknowledging that Plaintiffs allegations as to the GAAP claims are \u201centirely dependent\u201d on Plaintiffs\u2019 other allegations regarding Defendants\u2019 false or misleading statements) )\n20  \nFor this reason, P laintiffs have  adequately al leged that this fifth category of statements \nwere false or misleading .   \n \n20   Defendants also pointed to the fact that \u201c [n]either GCE\u2019s auditors [n] or the SEC \nhave raised any concerns\u201d regarding GCE\u2019s GAAP compliance, and therefore that Plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims \u201cshould not replace the sound judgment of these authorities.\u201d  (D.I. 62 at 19)  But there is nothing in the relevant record, one way or the other, about what GCE\u2019s auditors or the SEC thought about these allegations , or what \u201cconcerns\u201d they do or do not have about them.  So the \nCourt declines to make any assumptions about those matters here.   45 B. Scienter  \nHaving found that Plaintiffs adequately alleged  material misrepresentations/omissions , \nthe Court now turns to scienter.  The Court will first begin with a discussion of scienter -specific \nlegal standards .  The n it will move on to discuss the merits, ultimately explaining why it \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged scienter.   \n1. Legal Standards Regarding How to Plead Scienter \nWith regard to scienter, as noted above, the S AC must, as to each alleged false or \nmisleading act or omission, \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that \nthe defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u- 4(b)(2)(A) (emphasis \nadded).  And \u201cin determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to [that type of] a \u2018strong\u2019 \ninference of scienter, the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.\u201d  Tellabs, \nInc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 323 (2007).   \nThis inquiry is \u201cinherently comparative\u201d in that it requires  a court to \u201cconsider plausible, \nnonculpable explanations for the defendant\u2019s conduct, as well as inferences favoring the \nplaintiff.\u201d  Id . at 323- 24.  The inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be \nirrefutable or of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d genre, nor even the most plausible of competing inferences.  \nId. at 324.  But the inference must be \u201cmore than merely \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018permissible\u2019 \u2014it must \nbe cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations.\u201d  Id.  In the end, a complaint \nwill survive \u201conly if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter c ogent and at least \nas compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged[.]\u201d  Id.  And \ncourts evaluate scienter by examining the totality of the circumstances.  Avaya , 564 F.3d at 269 \n(\u201cAccordingly, as with all totality -of-the circumstances tests, our analysis will be case \nspecific.\u201d); S. Ferry LP, No. 2 v. Killinger , 542 F.3d 776, 784 (9th Cir. 2008) (\u201cThus, Tellabs  46 counsels us to consider the totality of circumstances, rather than to develop separately rules of \nthumb for each type of scienter allegation.\u201d); see also In re Wilmington Tr. Sec. Litig., 29 F. \nSupp. 3d 432, 448-49 (D. Del. 2014). \n\u201cScienter is a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, . . . and \nrequires a knowing or reckless state of mind[.]\u201d  Av aya, 564 F.3d at 252 (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).  A reckless statement is one \u201cinvolving not merely simple, or even \ninexcusable negligence, but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which presents a danger of m isleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so \nobvious that the actor must have been aware of it.\u201d  GSC Partners CDO Fund v. Washington, 368 F.3d 228, 239 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .\n21  One may \n\u201cstate a claim based on recklessness[,]\u201d for example, by \u201cspecifically alleg[ing] defendants\u2019 knowledge of facts or access to information contradicting their public statements.\u201d  In re Campbell Soup Co. Sec. Litig., 145 F. Supp. 2d 574, 599 (D.N.J. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation  omitted); see also City of Roseville Emps.\u2019 Ret. Sys. v. Horizon Lines, Inc ., 686 F. \nSupp. 2d 404, 424 (D. Del. 2009) (same).\n22 \n \n21  To plead scienter as to a corporate defendant (here, GCE), the complaint must \n\u201cidentify facts raising a strong inference that false or misleading statements were made or \notherwise promoted by an individual acting on behalf of each company and who knew or was reckless in not knowi ng that the statements were false or misleading at the time they were \nmade.\u201d  City of Roseville Emps.\u2019 Ret. Sys. v. Horizon Lines, Inc ., 686 F. Supp. 2d 404, 426 (D. \nDel. 2009).  To the extent that the S AC here would serve to sufficiently allege scienter as to \nMueller and Bachus, its scienter allegations would suffice as to GCE; were the allegations wanting on this front as to Mueller and Bachus, they would be wanting as to GCE.  (D.I. 62 at 5 n.7)  \n22  In In re  Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525 (3d Cir. 1999), the Third Circuit \nheld that plaintiffs asserting a Section 10(b) claim may \u201c plead scienter by alleging facts \nestablishing a motive and an opportunity to commit fraud, or by setting forth fact s that constitute \ncircumstantial evidence of either reckless or conscious behavior. \u201d  180 F.3d at 534-35 (internal 47 2. Discussion  \na. Defendants Knew or Recklessly Disregarded Facts \nContradicting Th eir Public Statements   \nThe Court begins its scienter analysis by considering Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed theory of \nscienter .  Plaintiffs assert, and the Court agrees, that a plaintiff often plausibly establishes  \nscienter where it shows that  the defendants knew or recklessly disregard ed the falsity of material \nmisstateme nts relevant to the alleged scheme.  See  Avaya , 564 F.3d at  268 (analyzing whether \nplaintiffs had adequately alleged that  the defendant s knew or w ere reckless regarding the risk \nthat the ir statements were false or misleading when made); see also Suprema Specialties , 438 \nF.3d at  278- 79 (same) ; Novak v. Kasaks , 216 F.3d 300, 308 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201c [S]ecurities fraud \nclaims typically have sufficed to state a claim based on recklessness when they  have specifically \nalleged defendants\u2019 knowledge of facts or access to information contradicting their public \nstatements .\u201d).  \nThe Court has earlier set out Plaintiffs \u2019 theory of scienter.  See  supra Section I.C.2.  In \ntheir briefing, Plaintiffs helpfully distill th at theory  down i n the following way : \nDefendants knew facts or had access to information contradicting \nspecific false and misleading material misstatements  regarding the \n \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  In 2009, the Third Circuit addressed this  question \nfurther; it recognized that after the Supreme Cou rt\u2019s 2007 decision in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor \nIssues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007), a \u201cshowing of motive and opportunity\u201d could no longer amount to independent grounds for  demonstrating scienter .  Avaya , 564 F.3d at 276- 77 & \nn.50; see also  City of Edinburgh Council , 754 F.3d at  172 (citing Advanta as \u201cabrogated  . . . by\u201d  \nTellabs  on certain grounds ); Gold v. Ford Motor Co., 577 F. App\u2019 x 120, 123 (3d Cir. 2014)  \n(noting that a plaintiff properly pleads scienter by alleging facts that constitute circumstantial evidence of either reckless or conscious behavior, and that motive and opportunity may no longer serve as an independent route to scienter).  Instead, the Third Circuit concluded that \u201ca general rule that motive allegations are sufficient \u2014or necessary \u2014is unsound.\u201d  Avaya , 564 F.3d \nat 277.  That said, the Third Circuit also recognized that the Supreme Court left much of the case law \u201c about \u2018 motive and opportunity\u2019  undisturbed.\u201d   Id.  As a result, it concluded that \u201c allegations \nof motive and opportunity are not entitled to a special, independent status [,]\u201d but \u201c they are to be \nconsidered along with all the other allegations in the complaint.\u201d   Id. (citations omitted).  48 structure of the Conversion, its similarity to other conversions, and \nthe DOE review process, all of which concealed the true risk that the DOE would decline to approve GCU as a non- profit institution  \n[to the detriment of investors].  \n(D.I. 66 at 14 (emphasis in original);  see also id. at 1  (\u201cDefendants\u2019 substantial, personal \ninvolvement in the [C]onversion process . . . gave them knowledge of non- public facts that \ncontradicted specific false and misleading material misstatements, including misstatements that \nconcealed key aspects of the mat erial risk that the DOE would not approve GCU\u2019s non- profit \nstatus.\u201d) (emphasis omitted); D.I. 60 at \u00b6 319)   Plaintiffs support their allegations that Defendants \nknew, or were reckless in not knowing, of the false or misleading nature of certain of their \nstatements by pointing to several factors:   \n\u2022 First, with regard to the \u201cstructure of the Conversion,\u201d \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants were directly involved in the \nConversion and intimately familiar with its terms \u2014such that \nthey knew or reasonably should have known that after the \nConversion went into effect, GCU would not truly be a \nseparate and independent entity from GCE, and  that many GCE \nemployees other than Mueller would have a \u201cdual role\u201d at both \nGCE and GCU.  For instance, the SAC alleges that it would be \n\u201cinconceivable\u201d for Mueller and Bachus to be unaware of the \nterms of the Conversion, since the Conversion \u201ccritically \ntrans formed\u201d GCE and \u201cwent to the core of GCE\u2019s business \nand business model,\u201d including the \u201cfundamental nature of \nGCE, its revenue sources (current and projected), its profit margins, its liabilities, and its CapEx budget[.]\u201d  ( D.I. 60 at \u00b6 \n323 (also noting that in a 2018 SEC filing , GCE stated that \n\u201c\u2018various aspects of [GCE\u2019s] operations have changed in \nimportant ways\u2019\u201d post-Conversion) )  Additionally , Mueller and \nBachus indicated in SEC filings that they had reviewed the MSA , and therefore, would necessarily have had knowledge of \nthe terms of the Conversion, which were set out therein .  (Id. at \n\u00b6 322)  Given these pleaded facts,  the Court concludes that \nPlaintiffs have adequately alleged that Defendants had knowledge of the terms of the Conversion.  See In re Urban Outfitters, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 103 F. Supp. 3d 635, 653 (E.D. Pa. \n2015) (finding it plausibly alleged that  two defendants, who \nwere top executives at a company, knew or reasonably should 49 have known of certain increased markdown activity and sales \ndeclines at the company, which were the subject of securities fraud allegations, where the executives were directly involved with the company\u2019s business activities and had  signed and \ncertified SEC documents that included false or misleading statements at issue) ; see also  SEB Inv . Mgmt. AB v. Endo Int\u2019l, \nPLC, 351 F. Supp. 3d 874, 905-06 (E.D. Pa. 2018).   \n \n\u2022 Second, with regard to the Conversion\u2019s \u201csimilarity to other \nconversions,\u201d Plaintiffs allege that Bachus was personally told \nfacts that contradicted Defendants\u2019 later statements that the \nConversion\u2019s structure was similar to the Purdue- Kaplan Deal .  \nMore specifically,  when Defendants decided in early 2017 to \nsubmit the renewed Change of Control application to the HLC, Solinski is alleged to have told Bachus  that there were \u201c\u2018real \u2019\u201d \nand \u201c\u2018key \u2019\u201d differences between the structures of the \nConversion and the recently -approved Purdue- Kaplan Deal , to \nhave sent Bachus articles clarifying the differences  and to have \npointed Bachus to publicly available filings about the Purdue-Kaplan Deal that demonstrated these differences .  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 \n73-74) ; cf. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., 905 F.3d \n971, 980-81 (6th Cir. 2018);  In re Celgene Corp. Sec. Litig., \n2019 WL 6909463, at *16.  And a fair inference from the pleaded facts is that Bachus would have in turn shared Solinski\u2019s comments with Mueller, since the two men were heavily involved in the Conversion together and because the Conversion was a very significant transaction for GCE/GCU.  In re Cadence Design Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., 692 F. Supp. 2d 1181, 1192-93 (N.D. Cal. 2010).  Now, a dmittedly, the SAC \ndoes not state what were the \u201creal\u201d and \u201ckey\u201d differences  \nbetween the two deals  that Ms. Solinski highlighted for \nBachus, nor how those differences impacted whether GCU should be considered a non-profit institution post-Conversion.  (Tr. at 42)  But as set out above, the SAC includes many other allegations about why the structure of the Conversion and the Purdue- Kaplan Deal were materially  different  in a manner that \nwould impact DOE\u2019s decision as to GCU\u2019s non-profit status.  In light of those other allegations, the Court can at least infer  \nthat Bachus\u2019 conversation with Solinski should have caused Mueller and  Bachus to exercise ordinary care in reviewing the \nterms of the two transaction s, which would in turn have made \nplain the differences highlighted in the SAC.   \n \n\u2022 And third, with regard to the \u201cDOE review process,\u201d the SAC \nalleges that Defendants knew about or recklessly disregarded 50 the significant risk that the DOE would not approve GCU as a \nnon-profit after the Conversion.  For example, there are the \nallegations that according to Solinski,23 in 2016 Frola and \n \n23   Defendants argue that any of the SAC\u2019s allegations drawn from conversations \nthat Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had with Solinski should be discounted as unreliable, on the grounds \nthat Solinski is biased against HLC and Defendants.  (D.I. 62 at 12 (citing Bartesch v. Cook , 941 \nF. Supp. 2d 501, 507 (D. Del. 2013))  On this score, Defendants argue that while the SAC states in a footnote that Solinski \u201csubmitted her resignation to the HLC [in early 2018] for reasons unrelated to the GCU evaluation[,]\u201d (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 90 n.2), this allegation is false.  (D.I. 62 at 12)  This is so, Defendants state, because Solinski:  (1) did not resign from HLC and instead  was \nterminated for cause; and (2) the reason she was terminated related to the GCU evaluation (i.e., it was \u201cdue to a conflict of interest in connection with HLC\u2019s review of [GCU\u2019s] change in control application\u201d).  ( Id.)  For support, Defendants include as exhibits to their opening brief:  (1) a \nComplaint that Solinski personally filed against HLC and Gellman -Danley in September 2020 in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the \u201cSolinski Complaint\u201d), in which Solinski stated that she was \u201cterminated [by HLC] on March 1, 2018 with no previous discipline or warning\u201d; and (2) a Charge of Discrimination that Solinski filed with an Illinois state agency, in which  Solinski appears to have stated that she was \u201cdischarged [from HLC] for a \nconflict of interest issue and loss of confidentiality in relation to a single member institution[.]\u201d  (D.I. 63, ex. 3 at 5; id., ex. 4 at 10-11; see also D.I.  62 at 12)   \n As an initial matter, it is worth noting that much of the allegations in the SAC that relate \nto something Solinski told Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel are about the HLC\u2019s review process regarding the Conversion.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6  75-95)  Yet as the Court previously discussed above, both sides now \nagree that those HLC -review -related allegations are irrelevant to the instant Motion, and so the \nCourt is not considering them here.  See supra  n.5.  What is at issue in this portion of the R&R \nare statements in the SAC th at Solinski made about:  (1) a meeting in May 2016 in which \nMueller referenced the fact that the DOE \u201chad given him pushback on the 2014 Conversion Proposal and that [Mueller]  did not believe the DOE or HLC would bless it in the future\u201d; and \n(2) Solinski\u2019s alleged conversations with Bachus in 2017, in which Solinski told Bachus about the differences between the Conversion and the Purdue-Kaplan Deal.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52, 74)   \n For a few reasons, the Court will consider (and will not discount) these allegations, at \nleast at the pleading stage.   \n First, the Court clarifies that even to the extent that it could take judicial notice of certain \nstatements made in the Solinski Complaint and the Charge of Discrimination (the \u201cextra -SAC \ndocument(s)\u201d), it is only permitted to consider the fact that those statements were made therein, \nnot whether those statements are true .  See Del Puerto Water Dist. v. U.S. Bureau of \nReclamation, 271 F. Supp. 2d 1224, 1234 (E.D. Cal.  2003) (\u201cJudicial Notice is taken of the \nexistence and authenticity of the public and quasi public documents listed.  To the extent their contents are in dispute, such matters of controversy are not appropriate subjects for judicial notice.\u201d) ; In re Peregri ne Sys., Inc ., 311 B.R. 679, 692 (D. Del. 2004) (same) .  So if the SAC \nalleged one thing, and an extra-SAC document asserted the opposite, it is not as if the Court 51 others at the DOE informed Mueller  that the DOE was unlikely \nto approve the 2014 Conversion (a proposal that was \nstructurally identical to the Co nversion at issue here) because \n\u201cthe transaction would result in the DOE, HLC, and other regulatory bodies being unable to regulate significant portions of [] GC U\u2019s operations and would likely improperly benefit the \nnewly formed for-profit company.\u201d  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6  49-50, 52, \n79)\n24  Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants  knew the \n \ncould easily determine that the SAC\u2019s allegation is  false .  (Tr. at 83)  A court cannot make \nfindings as to disputed facts at the motion to dismiss stage .  Flora v. Cty. of Luzerne , 776 F.3d \n169, 175 (3d Cir. 2015).   \n Second, to the extent that the Court can consider the fact that Solinski made certain \nstatements in the extra -SAC documents that a re asserted to conflict with her statements in the \nSAC , the Court cannot yet be sure that there is such a conflict.  For example, with regard to the \nissue of how Solinski left HLC, the Court acknowledges that the Solinski Complaint states that Solinski was \u201cterminated,\u201d while the SAC states that Solinski submitted her \u201cresignation\u201d from \nHLC .  If \u201cterminated\u201d means \u201cfired\u201d then this discrepancy may well later be problematic for \nPlaintiffs.  (Tr. at 131)  But Plaintiffs assert that \u201cterminated\u201d is a \u201clegal term of art\u201d and that by  \nit, Solinski did not intend to suggest that she was fired; in support, Plaintiffs point to a letter Solinski later received from HLC (a letter referenced in the SAC, such that it can be considered here), in which the HLC references Solinski\u2019s \u201cdeparture\u201d from the organization (not her \u201cfiring\u201d or \u201ctermination\u201d).  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 43; D.I. 66 at 22)  In light of the limited record on this point, the Court is not comfortable concluding that what is stated in the Solinski Complaint about Solinski\u2019s departure is necessarily inconsistent with what is alleged in the SAC on that score.  And with regard to the issue of whether Solinski\u2019s reason for leaving HLC was \u201cunrelated\u201d to GCU, so far as the Court can tell, the Charge of Discrimination does not actually state the name of the \u201cinstitution\u201d as to which Solinski was asserted to have a conflict of interest.  (D.I. 63, ex. 4 at 10 -11; see also  D.I. 66 at 22-23 n.25)  And the Court does not want to (nor should it) guess at \nthe answer here. \n And third, even if these extra-SAC documents could lead the Court to question whether \nSolinski might be biased in some way against HLC, the Court is not sure how they would demonstra te that she has an \u201cincentive to disparage\u201d Defendants .  (D.I. 68 at 8 n.9)  Defendants \ndid not work with Solinski, nor did they directly cause her departure from HLC.  If anything, the SAC alleges that Solinski had a close relationship with Mueller and Ba chus (at least as of the \nrelevant timeframe discussed in the SAC).   \n \n24   In the SAC, Solinski reports on Mueller\u2019s description of his conversations with \nthe DOE in this regard.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52, 333)  Defendants assert that this allegation should not be considered because it relies in some part on hearsay .  (D.I. 62 at 13 n.15)  But even if it \ndid, that would be irrelevant, as at the pleading stage the Court must accept all factual statements as true in order to test the sufficiency of the SAC.  See, e.g., Guzman v. Mana, Civil Action No. 52 falsity or misleading nature of certain statements they made in \nor around July 2018 to the effect that:  (1) they had had ongoing engagement with DOE, and (2) the reason DOE had not yet issued a decision on GCU\u2019s pre-acquisition application was due to  the DOE being \u201cvery understaffed.\u201d  This is alleged \nto be so because :  (1) the only communications that Defendants \nhad with DOE as of that date related to the DOE\u2019s May 2018 interrogatories, through which the DOE was expressing skepticism about GCU\u2019s request for non-profit status; and (2) the DOE had simply never told Defendants that any delay was due to \u201cunderstaffing\u201d (an assertion that was flatly untrue).   (Id. \nat \u00b6 283)  \n \nGiven these allegations, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that \nDefendants either knew or recklessly disregarded facts that contradicted their above- referenced \npublic statements  (or that should not have been omitted from their public statements ).  Even \nhaving so concluded, the Court will nevertheless go on to engage in the \u201cinherently comparative\u201d \nprocess of considering Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of fraudulent conduct along with Defendants\u2019 theory as \nto why no fraud has occurred.  Tellabs, Inc., 551 U.S. at  323-24.   \nb. Plaintiffs\u2019 Theory is at Least as Compelling as the Opposing Inference  \n After engaging in that  comparative process, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 overall \ntheory (i.e., as to why Defendants had an intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud) is at least as \ncogent as Defendants\u2019  competing theory of no fraud.  In explaining why this is so, it is perhaps \neasiest to start with a review of the first R &R\u2019s decision regarding scienter \u2014and an explanation \nof how, with the SAC\u2019s allegations, Plaintiffs have overcome the problems that beset their prior pleading. \n \n17-2551, 2018 WL 10150989, at *2 n.2 (D.N.J. Dec. 6, 2018) ; Dowell v. Bayview Loan Servs., \nLLC, CIVIL N O. 1:16- CV-02026, 2017 WL 9486188, at *21 (M.D. Pa. May 4, 2017). 53 In the first R&R, the Court concluded that the inferences Plaintiffs wished it to draw did \nnot meet the \u201ccogent and at least as compelling\u201d test .  This was because the theory Plaintiffs  put \nforward in th e CAC did not square with common sense and was not \u201ccogent.\u201d  (D.I. 50 at 35-43)  \nThe Court so concluded for a few primary reasons: \n\u2022 The CAC clearly and repeatedly alleged that when Defendants \nsubmitted GCU\u2019s pre-acquisition application, they were aware that, under the prevailing DOE regulations, GCU did not qualify on the merits as a non- profit institution.   And the CAC  \nalleged that Defendants freely gave documents to the DOE that would demonstrate as much.  This led to an understandable question that the CAC\u2019s allegations did not answer:  Why would Defendants think that there was any chance that the DOE would actually approve GCU for non-profit status if, on the merits, there was no way that the DOE reviewers should \nactually approve such a request?  ( Id. at 38-39)  The Court \nnoted that the CAC had not attempted to provide any factual explanation that answered this question\u2014with the possible exception of a conclusory, one- sentence reference to the fact \nthat after President Trump\u2019s election and the appointment of Secretary DeVos at  the DOE  \u201cfor-profit institutions faced a \n\u2018different regulatory environment\u2019 that might lead the DOE to be more favorable to non-profit conversions.\u201d  ( Id. at 39 -40 \n(citing D.I. 34 at \u00b6 44))  The Court explained tha t the lack of \ndetail in the CAC as to the nature of this \u201cregulatory environment\u201d\u2014and what it meant for the Conversion\u2014was problematic.  ( Id.)   \n \n\u2022 The lack of an answer to that  question was even more \nperplexing in light of the CAC\u2019s allegations that having the DOE approve GCU as a non-profit organization was \u201ca critically important feature of\u201d the Conversion, and was \u201cfundamental to [] Mueller\u2019s marketing plan to maximize enrollment [.]\u201d  (D.I. 34 at \u00b6 \u00b6 4, 49)  In fact, the CAC pleaded  \nthat after DOE ultimately rejected GCU\u2019s non -profit status, this \n\u201cplaced in jeopardy\u201d GCU\u2019s and GCE\u2019s entire \u201clong -term \nfinancial viability[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 94)\n25  Again, these allegations \n \n25   In their briefing, Plaintiffs suggest that in the first R&R, the Court wrongly \nassumed that the DOE\u2019s approval of GCU\u2019s non- profit status was an \u201call-or-nothing, \u2018bet the \ncompany\u2019 proposition.\u201d  (D.I. 66 at 2)  But as noted above, the Court assumed that this was the case because in the CAC, Plaintiffs pleaded that non- profit approval was \u201ccritical ly important\u201d 54 seemed to describe a theory of scienter that made little sense.  \nIf Defendants knew that the DOE  was not likely to grant their \nrequest for non -profit status for GCU, and if the failure of the \nDOE to do so w ould place in jeopardy GCU\u2019s and GCE\u2019s \nentire long- term viability , why  would  Def endants have sought \nthe DOE\u2019s approval in the first place ?  As the Court put it in \nthe first R&R \u201c [w]h y would Mueller and Bachus, two \nexperienced executives in the education sector, bet the future of GCU (an entity worth nearly a billion dollars) and their own large company (GCE), on a  \u2018gamble \u2019 that DOE would treat \nGCU as a non -profit \u2014when, if the Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of scienter \nis correct, any thinking person with real experience in this sector would know , just as Mueller an d Bachus are said to have \nknown, that GCU clearly and unmistaka bly did not qualify  as a \nnon-profit?  Why would these men make that incredibly high-\nstakes gamble with GCU\u2019s and GCE\u2019s future \u2014a gamble that \nwould seem, absent further explanation, to be surely doomed to fail?\u201d  (D.I. 50 at 38 (emphasis in original))   \n \n\u2022 Lastly, the Court noted that it did not seem sensible that in \nPlaintiffs\u2019 telling, Defendants\u2019 plan for fraud \u201cyo-yoed \nhaphazardly during the Class Period.\u201d  ( Id. at 41)  Here the \nCourt noted that in the CAC, it appeared that Plaintiffs were \nasserting that:  (1) as of January 2018, Defendants\u2019 plan \u201c was \nto gamble with the future of GCE and GCU, and hope that DOE would approve GCU\u2019s request for non- profit status, while \nknowing that on the merits DOE should never come to such a conclusion\u201d; but also that (2) \u201c just five months later in May \n2018\u2014after DOE propounded interrogatories that \u2018probed the \nunderlying structure of the Conversion and its financial benefits to [GCE] \u2019\u2014Defendants now r ealized \u2018 that the DOE \nwas not inclined to rubber -stamp the Conversion\u2019 \u201d and then \n\u201c\u2018reversed course \u2019\u201d by pressing \u201c \u2018full steam ahead \u2019\u201d with the \nConversion and \u201c simply await[ ing] the DOE\u2019s final decision \n(one that now looked like it would be negative as to non- profit \nstatus), all while telling the public that they still remained optimistic about the outcome. \u201d  (Id. at 41- 42 (citations \nomitted))   The Court noted that it did not mak e sense to think \nthat Defendants would \u201c knowingly hitch[] GCE\u2019s entire future \noperational and financial viability to a plan that they changed \n \nand \u201cfundamental\u201d to GCE\u2019s future plans, and that the DOE\u2019s ultimate denial of the request \u201cplaced in jeopardy\u201d GCU and GCE\u2019s \u201clong- term financial vi ability.\u201d   In other words, if the \nCourt got the wrong idea about the asserted stakes  involved with the DOE\u2019s review of GCU\u2019s \nnon-profit status, it got that idea from Plaintiffs\u2019 own words  in the CAC .  (Tr. at 87- 91)  55 radically in mid -stream, within the span of a few months .\u201d  (Id. \nat 42 (emphasis in original))   Without further explanation, this \ntheory suggested a \u201c a less -than-cogent narrative. \u201d  (Id. at 43)    \n \nHowever, in the SAC, Plaintiffs have now added numerous factual allegations meant to \nanswer these questions.  In the Court\u2019s view, these new allegations provide additional needed \ncontext and help articulate how Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the fraud scheme is cogent.   \nFor example, the SAC now includes allegations that better explain why, although \nDefendants are said to have understood that their MSA with GCU  \u201cviolated \u2018the most basic \ntenet\u2019 of \u201d non -profit status, (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 277), they nevertheless thought that there was a  \nreasonable chance that the DOE would approve GCU\u2019s non- profit request .  To that end, the SAC \nincludes significant new detail about why, during the DeVos administration at DOE, for -profit \nentities might initially have expected a more favorable outcome for proposals like the  \nConversion.  These included the following allegat ions:   \n\u2022 As soon as Secretary DeVos was confirmed, the Trump \nAdministration began installing veterans of for -profit education \ncompanies into DOE and White House leadership roles.  This \nincluded the appointment of former executives or consultants of for- profit education companies as  a senior policy advisor to \nSecretary DeVos, as senior counsel to the Secretary, as DOE\u2019s \ngeneral counsel and as the head of the DOE team policing \nfraud in higher educa tion.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 55 -61)   \n \n\u2022 This coincided with the roll ing back of several DOE \nprotections against student -abuses \u2014protections that had been \nunfavorable to for -profit institutions.   These roll -backs  \nincluded Secretary DeVos\u2019 plans to dismantle \u201ctwo key Obama-era rules enacted in 2016\u201d:  the Gainful Employment \nRule and the Borrower Defense Rule.  (Id. at \u00b6 62)   \n \n\u2022 For-profit institutions recognized this changed environment \nand began delaying plans to submit conversions until after President Trump assumed the presidency.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 65 -66)  \nAccording to Solinski , GCE\u2019s outside counsel informed her in \nthe summer of 2017 that he had advised his clients to wait until 56 the Trump Administration took power to initiate new \nconversions.26  (Id. at \u00b6 65)   \n \n\u2022 After January 2017, a number of for- profit institutions \ncommenced large scale conversions.  This included Dream Center Educational Holdings, Inc.\u2019s agreement to purchase 13 for-profit post-secondary institutions, and the Purdue- Kaplan \ntransaction.  In both cases, the DOE sent pre- acquisition review \nletters to those parties in September 2017 indicating that it did not see any impediment to the respective requests for, inter alia, conversion into non-profit status.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 66 -67)   \n \n\u2022 The changed environment was so marked that various articles published around that time highlighted the issue, ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 54, \n70-72), as did other industry insiders, ( id. at \u00b6 72).   \n These allegations render it more understandable why\u2014even after being told by the DOE after the \nabandoned 2014 Conversion that it was unlikely to approve such a transaction in the future\u2014\nDefendants  might have reasonably  thought that their odds for success had changed.\n27  It seems \nplausible that a n agency\u2019s leadership  might sometimes alter outcomes in the regulatory process \nin line with their pre -conceived views about what is good for an industry.  This could be so even \n \n26   For reasons set out earlier, the Court will credit this Solinski- related allegation at \nthe pleading stage.  See supra n.23. \n \n  27  The Court acknowledges that Plaintiffs are attempting to walk a nuanced line here \nin terms of articulating Defendants\u2019 alleged mindset.  On the one hand, Defendants are said to have been told by Frola  and others at DOE in 2016 that the DOE  was unlikely to approve a non-\nprofit proposal like that in the Conversion.  They are also said to have been aware that, on the merits, GCU really should not be considered a non- profit , post-Conversion.  In light of this, \nPlaintiffs assert that Defendants should have known that DOE approval of GCU\u2019s 2018 non-profit request was not very likely .  On the other hand, Plaintiffs are a lleging  that due to the \nbackground and mindset of DOE leadership as of 2017, Defendants could have reasonably thought that it was still possible  that DOE might nevertheless approve the request.  And t hey are \nasserting that Defendants could have still felt that wa y even after recei ving the May 2018 \ninterrogatories, which made the prospect of success even less likely.  (Tr. at 22 -24, 48-56)  But \ncogent theories (and alleged fraudulent schemes) can have nuance to them .  And it is at least \nplausible that all of these things could have been true here.     57 if the agency\u2019s line employees , after interpreting agency regulations, would t ake a very differen t \nview about what the outcome should be.  After all, e xecutive decisionmakers typically  are \nempowered with  great discretion.   Moreover, the SAC alleges that as of 2017 and 2018, for-\nprofit veterans held a sufficiently significant number of DOE  leadership positions; this could \nallow the reasonable inference that such  persons actually could have impacted the Conversion\u2019s \noutcome.  And in light of the SAC\u2019s claims about how these DOE leaders were so closely  \naligned with the thinking of for- profit educational institutions like GCE , now it seems plausible \nthat Defendants reasonably thought the Conversion might actually be approved in full (even if, \non the merits, it really should not have been).28 \n Additionally, because the SAC now better contextualizes how the request for non- profit \nstatus could have (and did) benefit GCE in the short term\u2014without threatening its viability in the long term were there a DOE denial \u2014this also makes Plaintiffs\u2019 theory o f scienter seem more \ncogent and compelling.  Put differently, while Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations  in the CAC about \nDefendants\u2019 mindset during the alleged fraud seemed \u201czig-zagging\u201d in nature, now the SAC \u2019s \nallegations make this appear less so.  For example, the SAC a sserts that GCE and GCU stood to \n \n28  The Court notes that it is not agreeing with the SAC\u2019s allegations about the \nmindset of DOE leadership during Secretary DeVos\u2019 tenure (i.e., that these leaders were in fact \nthe type of people who would have pr essured  line DOE employees to grant GCU non- profit \nstatus, even though GCU should not have qualified pursuant to DOE regulations).  Indeed, the SAC goes on to plead that the DOE ended up engaging in a vigorous review of GCU\u2019s non- profit \nrequest and ultimately did not  approve  that request.  That decision, of course, came from an \nagency led by Secretary DeVos, during the Trump Administration.   \n Instead, here the Court only concludes that, at the pleading stage\u2014whe n it must give \nPlaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable inferences \u2014it is now plausible  (and cogent) that \nDefendants thought  that their alleged scheme could be successful , in light of the background of \nDOE\u2019s new leadership in early 2017.  \n 58 benefit financially simply by virtue of the fact that the Conversion application was submitted to \nthe DOE.  This was because during this time period (i.e., while the DOE was reviewing their non-profit request), Defendants could and did bring in significant revenues for GCU and GCE\u2014due to the financial terms of the Conversion and by touting GCU as a \u201cnon -profit\u201d institution.  \nOn this score, the SAC alleges that from the Conversion\u2019s  close in July 2018 until the DOE \u2019s \nfinal decision in November 2019, GCE reported  \u201cstrong financial results that routinely exceeded \nmarket expectations [,]\u201d and its profit margins \u201cshowed immediate, enormous growth[,]\u201d which \nGCE attributed to the fact that it w as now marketing itself as a non- profit institution (leading to \nincreased enrollment ).  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 15 3-71)  And so the SAC now reads as if Defendants knew and \nbelieved from the start  that GCU\u2019s request for non-profit status could have paid off either way .  \nIf that request was granted, then  many  long- term financial benefits would certainly accrue to \nGCE  and GCU.  But even if the request w as denied, a number of financial benefits would still \nhave been generated in the  interval .  And GCE and GCU c ould still be viable in the future (i.e., \nwith GCU simply continuing moving forward as a for- profit institution ).\n29  This  better explains \nhow it could have been Defendants\u2019 plan from the start  to attempt the Conversion and move \nforward with it, even if the risks of rejection by the DOE were real and became greater during the pendency of GCU\u2019s application.   \n \n 29   Defendants suggest that the Court, in the first R&R, \u201calready rejected\u201d the notion \nthat the benefits of marketing GCU as a non- profit could have been a reason why Defendants \npushed forward with the alleged scheme, even after May 2018.  (Tr. at 22)  But the Court did no \nsuch thing.  Instead, in the first R&R, the Court was saying that if  Defendants had an \nunderstandable plan for fraud that was clear and unchanged from the outset (as opposed to one that changed \u201cin mid- stream\u201d) , then Plaintiffs neede d to do a better job of explaining th is.  (D.I. \n50 at 35 n.18 & 42-43)  Plaintiffs have done a better job in that regard in  the SAC.  \n 59  Relatedly, it now makes better sense why Defendants would have chosen to move \nforward with the Conversion, even after receiving the May 2018 interrogatories (which further \nplaced the prospect of GCU\u2019s non- profit approval in doubt).  To that end, the SAC explains that \nit was sensible for Defendants to continue with the Conversion post-May 2018, in light of, inter alia:  (1) the significant and \u201crisk- free\u201d financial and marketing benefits of touting GCU as a \nnon-profit, at least prior to a final decision from the DOE , (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 153 -71, 342)\n30; (2) the \nknowledge that , if there was any chance that the request might still get approved, that chance \ncould fall away if President Trump lost reelection in 2020, ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 123 -24, 341-42)31; and (3) \n \n30   Defendants call this  allegation illogical, arguing that \u201c[i]f . . .  Defendants \nrecognized by May 2018 that the DOE intended to deny [GCU\u2019s] request . . . then they also \nknew that any perceived \u2018marketing advantages\u2019 would have lasted, at most, a few months.\u201d  (D.I. 68 at 3- 4)  But for one thing, it is alleged that these marketing advantages lasted for much \nmore than a \u201cfew months\u201d\u2014that is, that they lasted from mid -2018 through to the DOE\u2019s \ndecision in November 2019.  And more than that, Plaintiffs are not alleging  that Defendants \nknew  as of May 2018 that the DOE would not approve GCU\u2019s non- profit request.  Rather,  \nPlaintiffs are alleging that the May 2018 interrogatories heightened the risk  that the DOE would \nnot approve.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 122-23; see also  D.I. 66 at 16 n.17; Tr. at 48)  Since the SAC alleges \nthat GCE would receive at least some of these financial benefit s whether or not the DOE \napproved the transaction in full, (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 17), and since it is no longer alleged that failure to obtain non-profit status for GCU would threaten that institution\u2019s (or GCE\u2019s) long- term viability, \nthe allegation does not seem illogical to the Court. \n \n31  Defendants assert that it does n ot make sense that they would be concerned about \nthis limited political window in which to obtain DOE approval if they \u201cknew [] there was a substantial risk \u201d that even the Trump Administration\u2019s DOE was going to deny the request for \nnon-profit status.  (D.I. 68 at 4 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) )  But as the Court \nhas said, the SAC now better explains why, even if Defendants  were uncertain as  to whether \ntheir alleged fraudulent scheme would work post-May 2018, they could have felt their \u201cgamble\u201d might still pay off with full DOE approval of the Conversion.  See Sgalambo v. McKenzie , 739 F. \nSupp. 2d 453, 484 n.193 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding scienter adequately ple aded , and rejecting the \ndefendants\u2019 alternate theory that they  did not act with fraudulent intent because they continued to \ninvest in the joint venture at issue, since there were plausible explanations that did not undermi ne \nthe inference of scienter, such as the fact that that the defendants might \u201chave been quite pessimistic\u201d regarding the joint venture \u201cbut chose to remain with the project and gamble on [its] \nsuccess . . . because its finances were sufficiently secure to  withstand the costs of a failed \nexploration\u201d); Tomaszewski , 482 F. Supp. 3d at  333 (finding scienter adequately alleged where, 60 the sunk costs Defendants had already put into preparing the application and Conversion \n(including the transition of nearly 7,500 of employees from GCE to GCU and the transfer of over $1.0 billion in assets), ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 123, 342).\n32    \nLastly, in light of the above, the SAC now better explains (somewhat contrary to what \nwas asserted in the CAC)  why if the DOE did not approve GCU as a non- profit , this would not \nhave threatened  the existence of GCE or GCU.  To this  end, t he SAC no longer includes the \nallegation s (previously found in the CAC ) that DOE approval of GCU\u2019s  non- profit request was \n\u201ccritically important\u201d to GCE/GCU, or that denial of that request \u201cplaced in jeopardy\u201d GCU\u2019s and GCE\u2019s \u201clong- term financial viability .\u201d\n33  Inste ad, the SAC pleads that  while Defendants \nclearly hoped that the DOE would fully approve the Conversion, \u201cmoving forward with the \n \ndue to a \u201ctime and money crunch, [defendants] took\u2014and lost\u2014a calculated gamble to initiate \nthe preparatory work for the Phase 3 studies without FDA approval, and that when the FDA expressed disagreement, [t he defendant] deceived investors in the hope that the FDA would end \nup agreeing with the data from the Phase 3 studies and approve [the drug in question] \u201d).   \n  \n32   Defendants argue that these sunk costs \u201cwould not be recovered regardless of \nwhether GCE mo ved forward with the Transaction[.]\u201d  (D.I. 68 at 4; see also  D.I. 62 at 8)  But \nPlaintiffs\u2019 point is that having already put a substantial amount of time and money into the Conversion process, this provided an incentive for Plaintiffs to continue to try for (and hope for) an outcome in which the DOE entirely approved the Conversion, even after May 2018.  If that \noutcome came to pass, then GCE would have gotten the most out of their investment of resources.  Th is is an understandable allegation .   \n \n33   During oral argument, when the Court asked about the \u201clong- term financial \nviability\u201d allegation, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel noted that the allegation was  \u201cin the first complaint\u201d but \nthat \u201c[i]n the amended complaint, we don\u2019t make that allegation.\u201d  (Tr. at 92)  It is somewhat \nconcerning that the facts about this point seem to have differed from pleading to pleading.  (Tr. at 94-96, 131); cf. ECB USA, Inc. v. Savencia, S.A ., Civil Action No. 19-731- RGA-CJB, 2020 \nWL 3893044, at *3-4 (D. Del. July 10, 2020).  But in reviewing the instant Motion, the Court must only look at the operative pleading (the SAC) and its allegations; it cannot consider the content of the prior pleading (the CAC).  (Tr. at 96, 114)  And even Defendants\u2019 counsel agreed that had GCU been denied non- profit status by the DOE, that was not an \u201cexigent\u201d matter for \nGCU, in that the \u201c[U]niversity would[ not] fail if they didn\u2019t get it.\u201d  ( Id. at 127) \n 61 Conversion would have immediate and tangible financial benefits for [GCU], even in the . . . \nevent that the DOE declined to app rove [n]ew GCU as a non- profit.\u201d  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 17; see also  \nD.I. 66 at 19)  As Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel noted at oral argument, the SAC now suggests that while the DOE\u2019s approval in full of the Conversion would have been a \u201csignificant plus factor\u201d for GCE/ GCU, the prospect that the DOE might deny non- profit status to GCU was not an \n\u201cexistential crisis\u201d for  those entities .  (Tr. at 88- 89) \nWhen considered as a who le, the SAC\u2019s allegations now  establ ish a cogent theory:  that  \nDefendants took a chance on obtaining DOE approval for GCU as a non- profit and, in the \ninterval before a decision was made, they knowingly misled the market regarding the substance of that request and about the risks of denial from the DOE.  And they did so because if their \ngamble paid off, GCU would have obtained valuable non- profit status; but even if it did not, in \nthe meantime , GCE could earn significant revenue from the Conversion, including by increasing \nenrollment through misleadingly marketing GCU as a non -profit  institution .  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 278, \n319; see also id. at \u00b6\u00b6 1 -23; D.I. 66 at 2 (\u201cDefendants reaped immediate and significant \nadvantages  by implementing the one -sided MSA while GCE pursued non- profit status for GCU, \nregardless of whether the DOE ultimately granted such approval.\u201d) ) \nMeanwhile,  Defendants\u2019 opposing theory of non- fraudulent intent is that they always \nreasonably believed that GCU met the DOE\u2019s definition of a non- profit institution.  (D.I. 62 at 9)   \nIn articulating why this theory is cogent  and more compelling that Plaintiffs\u2019 theory , Defendants \npoint to the IRS \u2019s 2015 and 2018 decision s to treat GCU as  a non- profit .  According to \nDefendants, th e IRS\u2019 s view was \u201ccritical\u201d because \u201cthe DOE\u2019s \u2018definition of a nonprofit \ninstitution mirrors the statutory language for tax exempt organizations found in 26 U.S.C. \n501(c)(3).\u2019\u201d  (Id.  (quoting D.I. 60, ex. A at 10))  Defendants also note that after the DOE denied 62 GCU non -profit status, GCU went on to file litigation against the agency challenging that denial.  \nDefendants argue that the fact that they were willing to sue the DOE shows that they firmly \nbelieved\u2014and continue to believe\u2014that GCU should rightly be treated as a non- profit.34  (Id. \n(citing D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 123, 342))   \nAs the Court has noted in the past, these facts may  be helpful to Defendants\u2019 case.  (D.I. \n50 at 44-47)  It might be that Defendants tru ly believed that GCU was a non -profit post-\nConversion and that Defendants did not knowingly misstate the risks of an alternative outcome.  \nBut there are other facts of record that the Court must consider.  And on this  record, the Court \nnow concludes that  Defendants\u2019 theory is not as compelling as Plaintiffs\u2019 theory.   \nOne such factor has to do with the nature of the IRS\u2019s approval of GCU\u2019s non- profit \nstatus.  On that point, as they did in the CAC, ( id. at 44 -45), Plaintiffs allege in the SAC that the \nfact of the IRS\u2019 s approval was \u201cno guarantee\u201d that DOE would also bless GCU\u2019s non- profit \nrequest , (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 109).  To that end, the SAC notes that in August 2016, the DOE rejected an \napplication for a change in ownership and to non- profit status that was filed by multiple for -\nprofit colleges owned by the Center for Excellence in Higher Education (\u201cCEHE\u201d) \u2014even \nthough the IRS had approved CEHE\u2019s  tax-exempt status in  2013.  ( Id.; see also id. at \u00b6 64)  \nMoreover, the SAC repeatedly alleges , in some detail, how the IRS has been accused by various \nsources  (e.g., the media , academics  and the Government Accountability Office) of rubber -\nstamping applications of for- profit institutions attempting to convert to tax -exempt entities .  (Id. \nat \u00b6\u00b6 145-52, 260- 61)  For example, in  an October 7, 2020 report entitled \u201cHow For- Profits \nMasquerade as Nonprofit Colleges[,]\u201d the author asserted that the \u201cIRS tax-exempt division has \n \n34  Defendan ts\u2019 argument here presumes that it can be demonstrated that they played \nsome role in causing GCU to pursue this litigation.  63 become an unreliable enforcer of nonprofit integrity\u201d ; in support, the author specifically called \nout the IRS\u2019s review of GC E\u2019s 2015 tax- exempt application , noting that the IRS approved the \nnearly 600- page application in just three we eks and \u201craised no issues and asked no questions [.]\u201d  \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 147-48 (internal quotation marks omitted) )  Finally, the SAC asserts that the IRS \nreviewed no documents relating to the Conversion in approving GCU\u2019s request ; therefore it  did \nnot have access to key  document s detailing the deal\u2019s structure ( like the MSA , or the analyses \nconducted by Barclays and Deloitte ).  (Id.  at \u00b6 173-74; see also id. at  \u00b6 276)  As noted above, the \nSAC alleges that the DOE denied the Conversion based on the information found in such \ndocuments .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 233, 249; see also id., ex. A at 14- 15)  So all of t hese allegations, which \nthe Court must take as true, help blunt the impact of the IRS\u2019s 2015 or 2018 approva l.   \nAdditionally  (and crucially ), above the Court has determined that it is plausibl e that \nDefendants knowingly made many materially false or misleading statements and/or omissions \nabout multiple aspects of the  Conversion.  Thus , the Court must take as true the assertions that, \ninter alia , Defendants  knowingly or recklessly:  (1) m isrepresented to the public the fact of \nGCU\u2019s lack of independence from GCE ; (2) misrepresented the risks that GCU would not be \ndeemed a non -profit by the DOE ; (3) made false statements about the status of DOE\u2019s review of \nthe Conversion (after receipt of the May 2018 interrogatories) ; and (4) falsely or misleadingly \nclaimed that the Conversion was similar to the Purdue -Kaplan Deal.   If Defendants were making \nfalse and misleading statements about nearly every aspect of the DOE non- profit approval \nprocess, then its seems a lot harder to believe that Defendants legitimately believed that GCU \nwas in fact a non- profit .  (D.I. 66 at 2)  And so this makes their theory of the case seem less \ncompelling  (for now) than Plaintiffs\u2019 theory.   See McDermid v. Inovio Pharms., Inc ., 520 F. \nSupp. 3d 652, 668 (E.D. Pa. 2021) ( determining that plaintiffs had adequately pleaded scienter, 64 and con cluding that because defendants made several knowing false statements and omissions, \nthis bolstered the conclusion that the inference of fraud raised by plaintiffs was at least as strong \nas any opposing inference offered by defendants) ; see also In re Amylin Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., \nNo. 01CV1455 BTM (NLS), 2003 WL 21500525, at *5 (S.D. Cal. May 1, 2003) (\u201cThere is \nnothing unlawful about taking a calculated risk.  However, if, as Plaintiffs allege, Defendants misled Plaintiffs about such risk by making assurances regarding the completeness of the data and the likelihood of FDA approval, Defendants may be held liable.\u201d).    For all of the reasons set forth above, the Court believes that  with the new allegations in \nthe SAC, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged scienter.    \nC. Loss Causation \nFinally, Defendants challenge the SAC\u2019 s loss causation allegations.  (D.I. 6 2 at 19-20)  \nBelow,  the Court will first set out the relevant legal standards  that apply to pleading loss \ncausation .  Thereafter, it will examine the merits.  \n1. Legal Standards Regarding How to Plead Loss Causation   \nLoss causation \u201c i\n s a causal connection between the material misrepresentation [or \nomission] and the loss [suffered].\u201d  McCabe v. Ernst & Young, LLP , 494 F.3d 418, 424 (3d Cir. \n2007).  The Third Circuit has adopted a \u201cpractical approach [to loss causation], in effect applying \ngeneral causation principles. \u201d  Id.  at 426 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nAdequately  alleging loss causation requires only pleading a \u201csufficient causal nexus between the \nloss and the alleged misrepresentation [.]\u201d  Semerenko v. Cendant Corp., 223 F.3d 165, 184 (3d \nCir. 2000).35  Thus, Plaintiffs can meet their burden by alleging that they purchased a security at \n \n35   There is some question as to whether Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading standards apply to \nallegations of loss causation, or whether Rule 8(a) \u2019s standards do instead.  See In re Chemours 65 market price that was artificially inflated due to a fraudulent misrepresentation and that the \nrevelation of the truth \u201cproximately caused the decline in the security\u2019s value[.]\u201d  Id. at 184-85.   \nIn ge neral, a \u201c corrective disclosure\u201d (that is, a disclosure that reveals the truth that has \nbeen obscured by a defendants\u2019 false or misleading statements or omissions) must reveal at least \npart of the falsity of the alleged  misrepresentation, and it must reveal new information to the \nmarket .  See, e.g., Paxton v. Provention Bio, Inc., Civil Action No. 3:21- cv-11613, 2022 WL \n3098236, at *18 (D.N.J. Aug. 4, 2022); In re Urban Outfitters , 103. F Supp. 3d at 655; see also \nIn re Williams Sec. Litig. -WCG Subclass , 558 F.3d 1130, 1140 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201c [ The \ndisclosure] must at least relate back to the misrepresentation and not to some other negative \ninformation about the company.\u201d ).  \u201cTo be corrective, the disclosure need not precisely mirror \nthe earlier misrepresentation [.]\u201d  In re Williams , 558 F.3d at 1140; Alaska Elec. Pension Fund v. \nFlowserve Corp. , 572 F.3d 221, 230 (5th Cir. 2009); see also In re Bristol - Myers Squibb Sec. \nLitig. , No. 00-1990(SRC) , 2005 WL 2007004, at *20-21 (D.N.J. Aug. 17, 2005).  Nor does the \ndisclosure have to be a \u201csingle, unitary disclosure[.] \u201d  See In re Bradley Pharms., Inc. Sec. \nLitig. , 421 F. Supp. 2d 822, 828-29 (D.N.J. 2006).  Instead, the truth may be revealed through a \nseries of partial disclosures through which the truth gradually \u201cleaks out.\u201d  See, e.g., Dura , 544 \nU.S. at 342 (acknowledging that relevant truth can \u201cle ak out\u201d ); Lormand v. US Unwired, \nInc., 565 F.3d 228, 261 (5th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[L]oss causation may be pleaded on the theory that the \ntruth gradually emerged through a series of partial disclosures and that an entire series of p artial \ndisclosures caused the stock price deflation. \u201d). \n \nCo. Sec. Litig., 587 F. Supp. 3d 143, 169 n.7 (D. Del. 2022).  The Court need not resolve that \nissue as the parties \u2019 arguments here do not turn on this question. 66 2. Discussion  \nTo demonstrate loss causation here, t he SAC alleges that  Defendants artificially inflated \nthe price of GCU stock by falsely stating or omitting:  (1) the truth about the relationship \nbetween GCE and GCU ; (2) the true risk that the DOE would not approve the transaction; and \n(3) GCE\u2019s financial results and improper accounting treatment of GCU.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 349)   Plaintiffs assert that Defendants\u2019 schem e was thereafter exposed to the market through two \npartial corrective disclosures:  ( 1) the November 6/7, 2019 announcements, which simply stated  \nthat the DOE had denied GCU\u2019s request to participate in Title IV as a non -profit and (2) the \nJanuary 28, 2020 report issued by Citron Research.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 237-56, 349- 52)  According to \nPlaintiffs, each partial disclosure caused a drop in GCE\u2019s stock price.  ( Id. at \u00b6 351)   \nThe Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged loss causation , for the \nreasons set out below. \nThe Court first addresses the November 6/7, 2019 announcements, in which Defendants \ndisclosed only that the DOE had determined that GCU did not qualify as a non- profit  (without \narticulating why the DOE had done so).  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 237-38)  Defendants  assert that the se \nannouncements cannot act as partial corrective disclosures because they \u201cdid not reveal that any of the alleged misstatements were false or misleading[.]\u201d  ( D.I. 62 at 19; see also  D.I. 68 at 14)  \nInstead, Defendants contend that the announcements conveyed nothing more than the fact that the DOE had approved the transaction but had denied GCU\u2019s non- profit request; thus, they  could \nnot have corrected any allegedly false information .  (See D.I. 62 at 19)   \nAt a minimum, the Court concludes that the November 6/7, 2019 announcements can \nqualify as a corrective disclosure because they revealed  at least  the falsity of Defendants\u2019 prior \nassertion that any delay in the DOE\u2019s approval of GCU\u2019s non-profit request had been solely due 67 to DOE \u201cunderstaff [ing].\u201d   The November 6/7, 2019 announcements could reasonably have \nconveyed to investors that, in actuality , the DOE\u2019s prior delay was due, at least in part, to the fact \nthat the DOE had serious questions on the merits about whether GCU actually qualified as a non-\nprofit \u2014questions that, in turn, ultimately led to the DOE\u2019s  November 6 th decision.  (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 \n245)   \n Finally, as to the January 28, 2020 Citron Report, Defendants argue that it cannot act as a partial corrective disclosure because \u201cit did not reveal any new information to the market.\u201d  (D.I. 62 at 20)  In support, Defendants note that in the fine print on its last page, the report states that \u201c\u2018all information contained herein . . . has been obtained from publ ic sources. \u2019\u201d   (Id.; see also \nD.I. 60, ex. B at 50)   \nYet while that is so, other evidence indicates at least a dispute of fact on the point.  As \nPlaintiffs note in their briefing, (D.I. 66 at 25), and a s is alleged in their Complaint, (D.I. 60 at \u00b6 \n250), the Citron Report also explains that it is based  in part on 870 pages of previously \nundisclosed information that Citron received from a FOIA request.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 250; id ., ex. B \nat 4)  Additional portions of the Citron Report also support this  idea.  In multiple places, the \nreport notes that Citron \u201csupplement[ed]\u201d the DOE  Letter  or \u201cd[u]g deeper\u201d with the transaction -\nrelated documents it received via the FOIA request .  (D.I. 60, ex. B at 5, 8, 47)  Plaintiffs further \nallege that the  report disclosed that, in light of the terms of the MSA, GCE  was receiving nearly \n100% profit margins from areas of GCU\u2019s business for which GCE booked no expenses\u2014i.e., facts that helped demonstrate why Defendants\u2019 prior statements about GCU\u2019s independence from GCE or GCU\u2019s status as a n on-profit w ere not accurate.  (D.I. 66 at 25 (citing D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 250 -\n55))  And these terms  of the MSA are alleged not to have otherwise been public.  ( D.I. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 \n250-54; see also id ., ex. B at 47 (Citron Report noting that \u201crelevant documents of the 68 transaction between [GCU] and [GCE]\u201d were obtained via its FOIA request))36  Thus, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently asserted,  at the motion to dismiss stage , that the Citron \nReport acted as a partial corrective disclosure based, in part, on previously undisclosed \ninformation.  Grigsby v. BofI  Holding, Inc., 979 F.3d 1198, 1202-06 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that \na plaintiff can establish loss causation  by pointing to a corrective disclosure that contained \npreviously non-public information obtained through a F OIA request ).  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that the Motion be DENIED.   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.  Objections, if any, must be filed by February 27 , 2023.  \nResponses, if any, must be filed by March 9 , 2023.  The failure of a part y to object to legal \nconclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo review in the district court.  See \nSincavage v. Barnhart , 171 F.

(D.I. 60 at \u00b6 252-54; see also id., ex.
