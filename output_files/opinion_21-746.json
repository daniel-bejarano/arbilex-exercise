No. 21-746-CFC \nKimberly Thomas, New Castle, Delaware, Pro se Plaintiff. \nJody Barillare, Esquire, Morgan Lewis & Beckius LLP, Wilmington, Wilmington, \nDelaware. Counsel for Defendant. \nMarch 7, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION {U_fJ.~ \nCONNOLLY, Chief Judge: \nPlaintiff Kimberly Thomas, who appears pro se and has paid the filing fee, \ncommenced this employment discrimination action on the basis of race and color \npursuant to the Title VII of the Civil Rights of 1964, as amended . (D.I. 2) The Court \nhas jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Before the Court is Plaintiffs request for \ncounsel, 1 Defendant's motion to dismiss, and Plaintiffs motion to file a sur-reply.2 (D. I. \n9, 14, 20) \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff was employed by Defendant ChristianaCare Health System, incorrectly \nnamed by Plaintiff as Christiana Care Health Services. Plaintiffs Complaint states that \nshe was harassed by her former employer based upon her race and color. (D.I. 2 at 2-\n3) The Complaint refers to a February 2017 occurrence when a \"former colleague \nharass[ed] her referencing [her] hair.\" (Id. at 4) Plaintiff reported the matter to Human \nResources and no one communicated with Plaintiff to address the issue. (Id.) \nPlaintiff alleges that as time passed the work environment became hostile, and her \nhairstyle is protected under 2 Del. C. \u00a7 1901.3 \n1 Plaintiff requests counsel. (D.I. 9) She paid the filing fee and seeks counsel on the \nground that she went \"through the proper channels with no resolution ,\" does not indicate \nthat she is unable to afford counsel, and provides no other grounds for counsel. Her \nrequest will be denied pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\u00a7 1915(e)(1) (The court may request an \nattorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel.). \n2 Plaintiffs motion to file a sur-reply will be denied as moot. (D.I. 20) After reviewing \nthe file, the Court has concluded that a sur-reply is not necessary . \n3 This statute, referred to as the CROWN Act was signed into Delaware law on April 13, \n2021. It is designed to prevent students, workers, and tenants from being subjected to \nunequal treatment due to hair texture or protective hairstyles historically associated with \nrace. The Act amends Delaware discrimination law so that the term \"race\" is inclusive \nof traits historically associated or perceived to be associated with race, including \nhairstyles like braids, lacs, and twists. See https://www .thecrownact.com/delaware \n1 The Complaint states that Plaintiff received a notice of right to sue letter from the \nEEOC on February 2, 2021. (Id. at 2) Plaintiff, however, did not attach to the \nComplaint or otherwise file with the Court a right to sue notice from the EEOC. \n(Plaintiff attached a right to sue notice from the Delaware Department of Labor; not the \nEEOC.) (D.I. 2-1 at 1) To date, Plaintiff has not provided the Court with a right to sue \nletter from the EEOC. \nDefendant moves for dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on the \ngrounds the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (D.I. 15) \nPlaintiff opposes. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court \nmust accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because \nPlaintiff proceeds prose, her pleading is liberally construed and her Complaint, \n11however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal \npleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94. A court may consider the \npleadings, public record, orders, exhibits attached to the complaint, and documents \nincorporated into the complaint by reference. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, \nLtd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). \nA Rule 12(b )(6) motion maybe granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the \ncomplainant, a court concludes that those allegations 11could not raise a claim of \n(last visited Feb. 14, 2022). \n2 entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \"Though \n'detailed factual allegations' are not required, a complaint must do more than simply \nprovide 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction.\"' Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555). The Court is \"not required to credit bald assertions or legal \nconclusions improperly alleged in the complaint.\" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. \nSec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed, \nhowever, \"for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\" \nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 135 S. Ct. 346, 346 (2014). \nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \"substantive \nplausibility.\" Id. at 347. That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"A claim has facial plausibility when the \n[complainant] pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the [accused] is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. Deciding \nwhether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. at 679. \nIll. DISCUSSION \nThe Court liberally construes the Complaint as alleging race discrimination and a \nhostile work environment due to harassment. Defendant moves to dismiss on the \ngrounds that Plaintiff fails to state claims of discrimination or harassment due to her \nrace. Plaintiff's response does not address the grounds for dismissal raised by \nDefendant; instead, she focuses on the termination of her employment and argues it \nwas too harsh and caused her distress. \n3 To state a claim under Title VII for employment discrimination, Plaintiff must \nallege that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the \nposition she held; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the adverse \nemployment action occurred under circumstances that give rise to an inference of \ndiscrimination. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). \nPlaintiff need not convince the Court of any of these elements at the motion to dismiss \nstage, but must submit more than \"the naked assertion\" that she suffered an adverse \nemployment action because of her membership in a protected class. See Santos v. \nIron Mountain Film & Sound, 593 F. App'x 117, 119 (3d Cir. 2014). \nTo state a hostile work environment claim, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she \nsuffered intentional discrimination because of her race; (2) the discrimination was \nsevere or pervasive; (3) the discrimination detrimentally affected her; (4) the \ndiscrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person in like circumstances; and \n(5) the existence of vicarious liability. See Aman v. Cort Furniture Retail Corp., 85 F.3d \n1074, 1081 (3d Cir. 1996). The first four elements establish a hostile work \nenvironment, and the fifth element determines employer liability. See Mandel v. M & Q \nPackaging Corp., 706 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir. 2013). \nThe essence of a Title VI I claim is that an employee has been treated less \nfavorably than others on account of her race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. \nSee Sarullo v. U.S. Postal Serv., 352 F.3d 789, 798 (3d Cir. 2003). Plaintiffs \nComplaint states that she was harassed by her former employer, and she checked \nboxes on the complaint form indicating that the discrimination was based upon race and \ncolor. (D.I. 2 at 3) Plaintiff, however, does not identify her race, and the Complaint \n4 contains no facts to support a claim of discrimination based upon race. Plaintiff alleges \nthat a fellow employee uharass[ed] me referencing my hair\" and \"complain[ed] on \nseveral occasions about my hair at work,\" but she does not describe her hairstyle, \nallege that she wore an ethnic or cultural hairstyle, or allege that the comments about \nher hair were racially motivated. Rather she describes the colleague's comments \nabout her hair as constituting \"unprofessionalism.\" (D.I. 2 at 4) \nEven when liberally construing Plaintiff's allegations, as the Court must, the \nComplaint fails to state Title VI I claims of race or color discrimination or a hostile work \nenvironment. With respect to discrimination, Plaintiff alleges at most that she is a \nmember of an unidentified suspect class and that she suffered an adverse employment \ndecision. The allegations, however, do not suggest that any alleged discrimination \noccurred because of her race. With respect to hostile work environment, there are no \nallegations that Plaintiff suffered intentional discrimination because of her race. The \nalleged behavior described does not suggest racial animus. Indeed, the claim does \nnot tie the allegedly \"offensive and hostile environment\" to Plaintiff's race in any way. \nPlaintiff must plead facts that plausibly connect her race or color to the adverse \nactions about which she complains. The Complaint fails in this regard. Therefore, the \nCourt will grant Defendant's motion to dismiss. Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, she \nwill be given an opportunity file an amended complaint to cure the pleading defects. In \naddition, Plaintiff will be ordered to provide the Court with a copy of the EEOC notice of \nright to sue letter. \n5 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will (1) deny Plaintiff's request for \ncounsel (D.I. 9); (2) grant Defendant's motion to dismiss (D.I. 14); and (3) deny as moot \nPlaintiff's motion to file a sur-reply (D.I. 20). Plaintiff will be given leave to amend and \nwill be ordered to provide the Court with a copy of the EEOC notice of right to sue letter. \nThe Court will issue an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n6 "}
