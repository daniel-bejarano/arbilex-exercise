Stark", "date": "01-07-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nCIRBA INC. (d/b/a DENSIFY) and\n\nCIRBA IP, INC.,\nPlaintiffs,\nVv. : C.A. No. 19-742-LPS\nVMWARE, INC.,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nOn January 8, 2021, the Court appointed John W. Shaw as a special discovery master in\nthis case. (D.I. 958) The Court\u2019s decision to do so came after the parties had absorbed an\nexcessive amount of judicial resources on their seemingly limitless discovery disputes.\u2019\n\nMany months later, on September 7, 2021, Plaintiffs Cirba Inc. (d/b/a Densify) and Cirba |\n\nIP, Inc. (together, \u201cDensify\u201d) filed a motion to disqualify the Special Master. (D.I. 1059; D.I.\n1076 Ex.9) The Court referred the disqualification motion to Mr. Shaw to hear and decide.\n(See D.I. 1040) After hearing argument on September 27 (see D.I. 1058), the Special Master\ndenied the motion on October 14 (D.I. 1060, 1061). Densify objected to the Special Master\u2019s\ndenial on November 4 (D.I. 1076), and Defendant VMware, Inc. (\u201cVMware\u201d) responded to the\n\nobjections on November 15 (D.I. 1085). The Court heard argument on December 22, (D.I.\n\n1114) (\u201cTr.\u201d)\n\n! See D.I. 947 (\u201c[T]he Court will be appointing a special master to handle all future discovery\ndisputes.... This highly-litigious action has already involved dozens of discovery disputes.\u201d).\n\n1\nThe Court reviews the Special Master\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions de novo.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 53()(3)-(4).\n\nHaving considered the parties\u2019 filings and arguments, and for the reasons stated below,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Densify\u2019s objections (D.I. 1076) are OVERRULED and\nDensify\u2019s motion to disqualify (D.I. 1059) is DENIED. However, for reasons related to case\nmanagement, and having nothing whatsoever to do with Mr. Shaw \u2014 who has acted throughout\nhis appointment with complete integrity and has provided valuable assistance to the Court \u2014 the\nCourt will terminate the referral to the Special Master for the remainder of this case.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMr. Shaw is a founding, named partner of the Delaware law firm Shaw Keller LLP\n(\u201cShaw Keller\u201d). See John W. Shaw, Shaw Keller LLP (last visited Jan. 6, 2022),\nhttps://shawkeller.com/attorneys/john-w-shaw/. He has been a member of the Delaware Bar for\nover 25 years and has an active litigation practice in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Delaware. See id.; see also Tr. at 211-12; see also generally D.I. 1076 at 1 (\u201cDensify\nhas no objection to the Special Master\u2019s qualifications.\u201d).\n\nShortly after Mr. Shaw\u2019s appointment as Special Master, the parties agreed on their own\ninitiative to exchange information \u201cregarding any connections the parties and/or their counsel\nmay have with the Special Master and/or Shaw Keller and vice versa.\u201d (D.I. 1076 Ex. 2 at 8-9)\nThe parties agreed that the purpose of this exchange was \u201cto disclos[e] and resolv[e] potential\ngrounds for disqualification.\u201d (D.I. 1058 at 4-5)\n\nVMware disclosed (among other things) that Mr. Shaw was working on behalf of two\n\nclients on four active cases in which Morrison & Foerster (\u201cM&F\u201d) \u2014 counsel for VMware ~ had\nalso appeared for those clients. (D.J. 1076 Ex.2 at 1) That disclosure included the relevant\ncase names and numbers, as well as the names of the two clients: Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.,\nLtd. (\u201cChugai\u201d) and Align Technology, Inc. (\u201cAlign\u201d). (/d.) Several of the M&F attorneys\nrepresenting Align have appeared for VMware in the instant case.2 Densify contends it was\nunaware of this fact at the time Densify and VMware were addressing potential grounds for\ndisqualification. (See Tr. at 188)\n\nDensify did not disclose any connections between Densify or its counsel and Shaw\nKeller. After receiving VMware\u2019s disclosures, Densify expressly consented to Mr. Shaw\u2019s\nservice as Special Master. (See D.I. 1076 Ex. 3 at 2 (February 11, 2021 email from Densify\u2019s\ncounsel to Mr. Shaw stating: \u201cHaving received disclosures regarding potential grounds for\ndisqualification from you, the Shaw Keller firm, and counsel for VMware, Densify consents\nunder Rule 53(a)(2) to your appointment as Special Master\u201d); see also id. Ex. 9 at 1 (Densify\nacknowledging it \u201cdid not object to appointment of the Special Master\u201d when it had opportunity\nat time of his appointment))\n\nThe record demonstrates, nevertheless, that at the time of Mr. Shaw\u2019s appointment, there\nwere at least four connections between Densify\u2019s counsel and Shaw Keller. (See D.I. 1060 at 4)\nMr. Shaw had appeared in three matters for clients alongside Kirkland & Ellis (\u201cK&E\u201d); K&E is\na firm representing Densify in the instant matter. (See id.) Ina fourth matter, other Shaw\n\nKeller attorneys (not Mr. Shaw) had appeared for clients alongside K&E. (See id.) While\n\n2 None of the M&F attorneys representing Chugai have appeared for VMware in the instant\ncase.\nDensify never disclosed these connections,\u2019 Mr. Shaw did so on September 2, 2021, just one day\nafter Densify first raised the disqualification issue.* (See id.)\n\nDensify purports to have filed its disqualification motion in response to the actions of one\nof Mr. Shaw\u2019s partners, Karen Keller. (See D.I. 1076 at 2)\u00b0 Months after Mr. Shaw was\n\nappointed as Special Master, Ms. Keller began representing a client in an unrelated matter\n\n3 The Court agrees with the Special Master, who wrote:\n\nAn objective, reasonable person knowing all the facts and\ncircumstances likely would view it as significant that Densify did\nnot identify these connections despite agreeing to identify \u201cany\nconnections and relationships\u201d that might constitute possible\ngrounds for disqualification.... Densify\u2019s actions suggest to an\nobjective, reasonable person that co-counsel relationships in\nlitigation between unrelated parties are not conflicts or possible\ngrounds for disqualification, and do not suggest a concern about\nimpartiality.\n\n(DI. 1060 at 16-17)\n\n4 The Special Master also notes that, at the time of his appointment, lawyers and law firms\nappearing on behalf of both Densify and VMware had appeared for clients adverse to clients\nrepresented by him or other Shaw Keller attorneys. (See D.I. 1060 at 5) Further, after his\nappointment in this case, Mr. Shaw began to represent a client adverse to a party represented by\nK&E (one of the firms representing Densify) and another client adverse to a party represented by\nYoung Conaway Stargatt & Taylor, a firm representing VMware. (See id.) Densify did not\nassett in its motion that these representations provide a basis for disqualification.\n\n5 Densify\u2019s counsel insist they \u201craise[d] this objection as officers of the Court\u201d \u201cin order to\nsafeguard the integrity of these proceedings.\u201d (D.I. 1076 at1) The Court need not (and does\nnot) make any finding as to Densify\u2019s motives (by which the Court does not mean to suggest it\ndoubts Densify\u2019s sincerity). While the timing of Densify\u2019s motion to disqualify is far from\nideal, as many of the facts on which it is based existed and were easily knowable at the time\nDensify consented to Mr. Shaw\u2019s appointment, Densify is correct that it \u201cobjected before the\nSpecial Master issued any rulings.\u201d (/d.) This distinguishes the circumstances presented here\nfrom those in many cases cited by VMware, in which parties seeking disqualification of a special\nmaster (or a judge) only first developed qualms after receiving an unfavorable ruling. (See D.I.\n1085) (citing, e.g., In re United States, 666 F.2d 690 (1st Cir. 1981); Jenkins v. Sterlacci, 849\nF.2d 627 (D.C. Cir. 1988))\nalongside M&F attorneys, none of whom have appeared in this case. (See D.I. 1060 at 7)\nSpecifically, Ms. Keller began representing Leviton Manufacturing Company (\u201cLeviton\u201d) in a\nsuit brought by Corning Optical Communications LLC (\u201cCorning\u201d) in the District of Delaware\non August 18,2021. (See id. at 6-7) Corning is represented by Reichman Jorgensen Lehman\n& Feldberg LLP (\u201cRJLF\u201d), which is counsel for Densify in the instant matter. Two of the same\nRJLF attorneys representing Corning are counsel for Densify in this case.\n\nThere appears to be no dispute that Ms. Keller reached out to M&F about serving as\nDelaware counsel for Leviton. (See id. at 7; Tr. at 199) Densify characterizes this\ncommunication as \u201csolicitation,\u201d but there is little information in the record about the\ncommunication or what prompted Ms. Keller to reach out to M&F, (D.I. 1060 at 7) The record\nincludes an email from counsel for VMware stating that M&F had \u201cretained\u201d Ms. Keller as\nDelaware counsel in the Corning/Leviton litigation. (D.I. 1076 Ex. 4 at 1) All other evidence,\nhowever, supports the conclusion that Ms. Keller is retained by Leviton (not M&F), that she\nowes duties to Leviton (not M&F), and that she is paid by Leviton (not M&F). (See, e.g., D.L\n1085-1 Ex. A) (letter of engagement between Leviton and Ms. Keller)\n\nAs part of his resolution of Densify\u2019s motion to disqualify, the Special Master asked.\nM&F to implement a screen to ensure that no M&F attorney in this action will become involved\nin the Corning/Leviton litigation, and that no M&F attorney in that action will become involved\nin this litigation. (See D.I. 1060 at 14; D.I. 1061) M&F has done so. (See D.I. 1085 at 3)\nShaw Keller has also implemented an ethical wall between the Corning/Leviton matter and this\nmatter. (See D.L 1060 at 8)\n\nNotwithstanding this record and these efforts, Densify argues the Court must disqualify\nthe Special Master pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 455(a) & (b)(4), which is made applicable to Special\nMasters under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(a)(2). (See D.I. 1076 at 1, 4-5) (arguing\nrecusal of Special Master is \u201crequir[ed]\u201d)\u00ae Section 455(a) requires a Special Master to\n\u201cdisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d\nand the applicable analysis focuses on whether an objective, reasonable layperson with\nknowledge of all the facts would doubt his impartiality. In re Kensington Int\u2019l Ltd., 368 F.3d\n289, 303 (3d Cir. 2004). Under Section 455(b)(4), a Special Master should disqualify himself\nalso if he \u201cknows that he .. . has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a\nparty to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome\nof the proceeding.\u201d Densify has not argued there is a meaningful distinction between the 455(a)\nand (b)(4) analyses in this case. (See D.I. 1060 at 10)\u2019\nDISCUSSION\n\nDensify objects to the Special Master\u2019s denial of its motion on three primary grounds.\n\nEach lacks merit.\n\nFirst, Densify contends that Shaw Keller has an \u201congoing financial relationship\u201d with\n\n6 But see D.I. 1058 at 5 (Density agreeing before Special Master that disqualification \u201cis a matter\nof discretion\u201d).\n\n7 Accordingly, the Court focuses its analysis on Section 455(a). The result is the same under\nSection 455(b)(4), as the record does not support a finding that Mr. Shaw has: (4) a financial\ninterest in the subject matter in controversy between Densify and VMware (essentially, mutual\nallegations of patent infringement by purportedly competing companies); (ii) a financial interest\nin Densify or VMware, the parties to the instant proceeding; or (iii) any other interest that could\nbe substantially affected by the outcome of the instant proceeding \u2014 Mr. Shaw will be paid the\nsame for his duties as Special Master regardless of who prevails (on any issue or in a final\njudgment) in this case, and there is no evidence that Mr. Shaw\u2019s or Shaw Keller\u2019s opportunities\nor other interests will be \u201csubstantially affected\u201d by the outcome of this case.\n\n6\nM&F that requires recusal. (D.I. 1076 at 5) In particular, Densify argues that as a result of Ms.\nKeller\u2019s decision to represent Leviton in the Corning/Leviton case, Shaw Keller \u201cwill be making\nmoney from\u201d M&F, adding that M&F can give Ms. Keller (or presumably Mr. Shaw or other\nattorneys at Shaw Keller) more or less work and money depending on M&F\u2019s satisfaction with\nMr. Shaw\u2019s decisions in the instant case. (Jd. at 6-7; see also D.I. 1060 at 13) The evidence in\nthe record does not support Densify\u2019s characterization of the facts.\n\nInstead, the Court agrees with the Special Master that an objective, reasonable layperson\nwould understand that the client (Leviton) \u2014 not the law firm (M&F) \u2014 is responsible for paying\nfees incurred by Shaw Keller on Leviton\u2019s behalf. (See D.I. 1060 at 13) The engagement letter\nbetween Leviton and Ms. Keller (see D.I. 1085-1 Ex. A) supports this conclusion. Further, no\none contends the parties in the Corning/Leviton case are at all related to the parties in the instant\naction. (See DI. 1060 at 14) Even if Ms. Keller first reached out to M&F regarding\nrepresentation of Leviton, and even if M&F connected Ms. Keller to Leviton, these preliminaries\ndo not justify a finding of \u201can ongoing financial relationship\u201d between Shaw Keller and M&F or\nthat Shaw Keller is being paid by M&F.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court finds unpersuasive Densify\u2019s argument that the 15 now-\ninactive cases in which the Special Master or his firm worked alongside M&F support a finding\nof an ongoing financial relationship. (See Tr. at 190,205) As counsel for VMware pointed out\nat the hearing, when considered in the context of Mr. Shaw\u2019s more than 25 years of practice in\nthis busy District, these 15 now-inactive cases (all involving parties unrelated to the parties here)\ncarry little weight in the analysis. (See id at 211-12) The Court further agrees with VMware\n\nthat \u201c[t]here is no principled difference between the Leviton Engagements \u2018financial benefits to\nShaw Keller[]\u2019 and the \u2018financial benefits\u2019 provided in the previously disclosed engagements to\nwhich [Densify] did not object and any similar future engagements.\u201d (D.I. 1076 Ex. 11 at 4)\n(internal citation omitted)\n\nSecond, as a separate basis for recusal, Densify points to active and inactive cases in\nwhich Mr. Shaw is serving or has served as co-counsel with M&F attorneys. (D.I. 1076 at 7-8)\nIn this version of its argument, Densify does not appear to allege an ongoing financial\nrelationship but, instead, a subtle entanglement among Mr. Shaw, Ms. Keller, and/or Shaw\nKeller and M&F, which would supposedly lead a reasonable layperson to doubt Mr. Shaw could\nimpartially carry out the duties assigned to him by this Court in the instant case. Densify\nappears most concerned with Mr. Shaw\u2019s involvement in the Align cases (see Tr. at 188, 213-\n14), the only two cases in which Mr. Shaw is currently representing a client alongside M&F\ncounsel representing VMware here (see D.I. 1076 Ex. 8; see also D.I. 1085 at 1 n.1 (explaining\nthat client represented by Mr. Shaw and M&F in \u201cactive\u201d Baxalta case had been dismissed by\ntime of VMware\u2019s disclosures)). Crucially, as VMware correctly notes, Densify was aware of\nthe Align cases when it consented to the Special Master\u2019s appointment, yet it did not indicate\nany concerns about these cases when it consented to Mr. Shaw\u2019s appointment or even in its\neventual letter moving for his recusal. (D.I. 1085 at 4, 7/8\n\nIn the Third Circuit, an assessment of the timeliness of a motion seeking disqualification\n\nunder Section 455(a) generally turns on the movant\u2019s actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to\n\n8 The Align cases are all pending before the undersigned Judge. (See, e.g., C.A. Nos. 17-1646-\nLPS & 17-1647-LPS) At no point has any party expressed any concern about this fact nor\nsuggested that a reasonable layperson would find it to be a basis to question the impartiality of\nMr. Shaw, or of the undersigned Judge in reviewing Mr. Shaw\u2019s work as Special Master.\nthe recusal motion. See Kensington, 368 F.3d at 314. However, \u201c[t]here may be instances in\nwhich constructive knowledge is so pervasive that it is tantamount to actual knowledge.\u201d Id.\nIn the Court\u2019s view, this is one of those instances. VMware timely disclosed the Align case\nnames and numbers, as well as client information. Through a simple search of publicly\navailable records, one of the many lawyers representing Densify could have easily obtained the\ninformation Densify now suggests was withheld. (See Tr. at 188-89) Accordingly, the Court\nconcludes that Densify knew or should have known of Mr. Shaw\u2019s representation in the Align\ncases (alongside the M&F attorneys representing VMware here) at the time Densify expressly\nconsented to Mr. Shaw\u2019s appointment as Special Master. Since Densify did not raise this issue\nat that time, and again did not raise this issue even in its motion to disqualify, the Court agrees\nwith the Special Master that Densify waived it as a basis for disqualification.\u201d (See D.I. 1060 at\n20-21; see also Jenkins, 849 F.2d at 633-34 (finding that, despite \u201ccomplementary failures\u201d on\npart of counsel and special master to properly disclose potential conflicts, party waived\nobjections forming basis for recusal in view of party\u2019s constructive notice of potential conflict))\nNor does the Special Master\u2019s failure to provide a Rule 53 affidavit preclude a finding of\nwaiver. While it is the Special Master\u2019s burden to disclose possible grounds for\ndisqualification, see Kensington, 368 F.3d at 313, the parties here voluntarily agreed to take it\nupon themselves to disclose any such grounds. It was reasonable for the Special Master to rely\non the parties\u2019 efforts in this regard and to satisfy his burden (at least in part) through those\n\nefforts. It was also reasonable for Mr. Shaw to consider Densify\u2019s lack of disclosure of\n\n9 Densify only first alluded to the Align cases as a reason for Mr. Shaw\u2019s recusal in the\nSeptember 27 hearing before Mr. Shaw. (See D.I. 1058 at 9; see also DI. 1085 at 1-2)\nrelationships between Shaw Keller and firms representing Densify when determining whether he\nhad a duty to disclose the type of co-counsel relationships Densify now asserts raise concerns\n\nabout impartiality.!\u00b0 Further, although Densify had ample opportunity to object to the Special\n\nMaster\u2019s failure to provide a Rule 53 affidavit (i.c., before it consented to his appointment, in its\nmoving papers, or at the hearing before the Special Master), Densify substantially delayed\nraising this argument. It is, therefore, waived.!!\n\nThird, Densify contends that Shaw Keller\u2019s \u201cadversity\u201d to RJLF in the Corning/Leviton\nmatter is an \u201caggravating factor\u201d supporting disqualification. (D.I. 1076 at 8-9; see also D.I.\n1060 at 17) By describing it as an \u201caggravating factor,\u201d Densify appears to concede \u2014 properly,\nin the Court\u2019s view \u2014 that the happenstance of Shaw Keller and M&F appearing for a client\n\nagainst a client of RJLF (including two of the same RJLF attorneys appearing for Densify here), |\n\n'0 The Court is not suggesting Mr. Shaw had no duty of disclosure; only that in fulfilling his\nduty of disclosure it was entirely reasonable for Mr. Shaw to rely, at least in part, on the efforts\nof the lawyers and litigants involved in this action. Mr. Shaw did disclose to the parties relevant\ninformation that could not have been known or easily discovered by all of them, including a\npersonal representation of him by one of the firms involved in this case. (See D.I. 1060 at 3)\n\n'l As Densify noted at the hearing, Section 455 limits parties\u2019 ability to waive certain kinds of\nconflicts. (See Tr. at 193-94) Section 455(e) provides that a party cannot waive any of the\ngrounds for disqualification enumerated in subsection (b). By contrast, \u201c[wJhere the ground for\ndisqualification arises only under subsection (a), waiver may be accepted provided it is preceded |\nby a full disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification.\u201d As the Court has already |\nexplained, in its view, VMware\u2019s disclosure of the Align cases was a \u201cfull disclosure,\u201d providing |\nDensify with constructive knowledge of Mr. Shaw\u2019s representation alongside the M&F attorneys\nrepresenting VMware here. Thus, pursuant to Section 455(e), Densify\u2019s arguments under\nsubsection (a) relating to Mr. Shaw\u2019s impartiality can be \u2014 and are \u2014 waived. Densify has not\nargued that the Court should engage in a distinct analysis of its grounds for disqualification\nunder subsection (b)(4). Moreover, as the Court has already concluded, the record does not\nsupport a finding that any of those grounds apply to Mr. Shaw. The Court finds, therefore, that\nDensify\u2019s arguments are not of a kind that cannot be waived under Section 455(e). Densify\u2019s\nconcession before the Special Master that disqualification \u201cis a matter of discretion\u201d (D.I. 1058\nat 5) provides further support for this conclusion.\n\n10\nin a matter utterly unrelated to this case, is not, in itself, a sufficient basis for recusal. In the\nCourt\u2019s view, there is no appearance of impropriety. Densify\u2019s contention that \u201cShaw Keller is\nadverse to RJLF\u201d is incorrect. It is Ms. Keller, not Mr. Shaw, who represents Leviton; and,\nmore importantly, it is Leviton \u2014 the client \u2014 who is adverse to Corning, who is represented by\nRJLF. Further, Shaw Keller has implemented an ethical wall between the Corning/Leviton\nmatter and this matter. Given these degrees of separation, and all the facts and circumstances\nthat would be known to a reasonable layperson, the participation of counsel for RJLF in both\nmatters would not raise substantial concerns to such a person about Mr. Shaw\u2019s impartiality as\nSpecial Master here.!?\n\nFinally, the Special Master\u2019s conduct throughout this case, when viewed in its entirety,\nweighs strongly against a finding of an appearance of impropriety. The Special Master has been\nforthright about his process for evaluating potential grounds for disqualification (see D.I. 1060 at\n1-2), has continued to disclose possible grounds for disqualification as they arise (id. at 4-6), and\nhas implemented screening measures to distance himself from the Corning/Leviton litigation (id.\nat 8, 14). In the Court\u2019s view, the Special Master\u2019s conduct \u2014 which would be known to a\nreasonable layperson \u2014 further precludes any significant chance that a reasonable layperson\n\nwould doubt his impartiality to perform the duties assigned to him by this Court as its Special\n\n2 Sightsound Technologies., LLC v. Apple, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127498 (W.D. Pa. Sept.\n7, 2012), provides further support for the Court\u2019s conclusion. In that case, a special master\u2019s\nlaw firm represented, in an unrelated matter, an affiliate of one of the litigants before the special\nmaster, See id. at*2. The court determined that, among other factors, an ethical screen\nimplemented at the special master\u2019s law firm sufficiently addressed concerns about his partiality\nunder Section 455(a). Here, the relationship is even more attenuated than in Sightsound, as the\nSpecial Master\u2019s connection is not with a party but with its outside counsel. As in Sightsound,\nthe Court concludes that the screening procedures imposed by Mr. Shaw, in addition to the other\nfactors the Court has cited, are sufficient to address any concerns.\n\n11\nMaster. 3\nGOING FORWARD\n\nWhile the Court rejects Densify\u2019s arguments, and shares none of Densify\u2019s concerns\nabout the appointment of Mr. Shaw \u2014 an appointment Densify expressly consented to \u2014 the\nCourt\u2019s consideration of the motion to disqualify and other recent matters (including the\nDecember 22, 2021 claim construction hearing) has provided occasion for the Court to consider\nagain the necessity of retaining a Special Master to assist with discovery matters. Happily, in\nthe approximately one year that Mr. Shaw has served as Special Master, only three motions to\ncompel have been filed, which contrasts extremely favorably with the \u201cdozens of discovery\ndisputes\u201d the Court confronted in the first 20 months of the case, before Mr. Shaw\u2019s\nappointment. (D.I. 947) (citing, e.g., D.I. 89, 185, 268, 277-78, 296, 313, 341, 408, 419-20,\n501, 815, 860, 902) Further, the case schedule provides that fact discovery will conclude on\nApril 29, 2022, less than four months from now. (D.L. 1003 { 9(a))\n\nAccordingly, the Court has determined that it no longer requires the assistance of a\n\nSpecial Master in this case. The rulings the Special Master has issued to date (see D.I. 1038,\n\n13 As Densify points out, Rule 53(a)(2) provides: \u201cA master must not have a relationship to the\nparties, attomeys, action, or court that would require disqualification of a judge under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 455, unless the parties, with the court\u2019s approval, consent to the appointment after the master\ndiscloses any potential grounds for disqualification.\u201d (D.I. 1076 at 4) The Court\u2019s ruling is in\naccord with this rule because, as explained, Densify did consent to Mr. Shaw\u2019s appointment,\nafter he had disclosed \u2014 through the procedures agreed to by the parties \u2014 any potential grounds\nfor disqualification. See also generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(a)(2) & (3) advisory committee\u2019s\nnotes to 2003 amendment (\u201cBecause a master is not a public judicial officer, it may be\nappropriate to permit the parties to consent to appointment of a particular person as master in\ncircumstances that would require disqualification of a judge.\u201d).\n\n12\n1044), to which no party presented any timely objections,'* remain in effect and are binding on\nthe parties. The pending discovery disputes (see D.I. 1097), as well as any additional discovery\ndisputes (should any arise as this case proceeds), will be resolved by the undersigned Judge\npursuant to a separate order. The Court is hopeful that the parties will exercise the same\n\nrestraint regarding discovery disputes that they demonstrated before the Special Master.\n\n| RA / \u2014\"\\ Z\nJanuary 7, 2022 HONORABLE LEONARD P.
