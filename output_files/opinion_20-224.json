(\"Plaintiff' or \"V axcel\") sued Defendant HeathCo \nLLC (\"Defendant\" or \"Heath Co\") for the alleged infringement of various patents. (See generally \nD.I. 1, 30)1 The patents generally relate to technology involving lighting apparatuses. Many of \nthe patents have a common specification , and the patents with that shared specification describe \nand claim \"a two-level security LED light with motion sensor.\" (See, e.g., '362 patent at 1:15-\n16) The parties filed ajoint claim construction brief and an appendix on July 19, 2021. (D.I. 69, \n70) The Court conducted a claim construction hearing on August 2, 2021. (See generally D.I. \n75) (\"Tr.\") \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Claim Construction \nThe ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question of law. See \nTeva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318,321 (2015) (citing Markman v. Westview \nInstruments , Inc. (\"Markman II\"), 517 U.S. 370, 388-91 (1996)). \"It is a bedrock principle of \npatent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the \nright to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for conducting \nclaim construction. \" Id at 1324. The Court is free to attach the appropriate weight to \nappropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law .\" Id. \n\"[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning, \" \nwhich is \"the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art \n1 The asserted patents are U.S. Patent Nos. 9,326,362 ('\"362 patent\"), 9,560,719 (\"'719 \npatent\"), 10,136,503 ('\"503 patent\"), 10,154,564 ('\"564 patent\"), 10,187,947 ('\"947 patent\"), \n10,225,902 (\"'902 patent\"), 10,491,032 ('\"032 patent\"), 10,516,292 (\"'292 patent\"), 10,667,367 \n('\"367 patent\"), 10,763,691 ('\"691 patent\"), and 10,770,916 (\"'916 patent\"). \n1 [(\"POSA \")] in question at the time of the invention , i.e., as of the effective filing date of the \npatent application.\" Id. at 1312-13 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he ordinary meaning \nof a claim term is its meaning to the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\" Id. at 13 21 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). The patent \"specification is always highly relevant to the \nclaim construction analysis. Usually, it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning \nof a disputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \nWhile \"the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of \nparticular claim terms,\" the context of the surrounding words of the claim also must be \nconsidered. Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. Furthermore , \"[o]ther claims of the patent in question, \nboth asserted and unasserted , can also be valuable sources of enlightenment\" because \"claim \nterms are normally used consistently throughout the patent.\" Id. \nIt is likewise true that \"[d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide.\" Id. \"For \nexample, the presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a \npresumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id. at 1314-\n15. This presumption of claim differentiation is \"especially strong when the limitation in dispute \nis the only meaningful difference between an independent and dependent claim, and one party is \nurging that the limitation in the dependent claim should be read into the independent claim.\" \nSunRace Roots Enter. Co. v. SRAMCorp ., 336 F.3d 1298, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \nIt is also possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim \nterm by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the \ninventor's lexicography governs.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. It bears emphasis that, \"[e]ven \nwhen the specification describes only a single embodiment, the claims of the patent will not be \nread restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope \n2 using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction. \" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker \nCorp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn addition to the specification , a court should \"consider the patent's prosecution history, \nif it is in evidence. \" Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc. (\"Markman I\"), 52 F.3d 967,980 \n(Fed. Cir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 (1996). The prosecution history, which is \n\"intrinsic evidence, \" \"consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the [U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\" \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. \"[T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim \nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor \nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution , making the claim scope narrower than it \nwould otherwise be.\" Id. \nSometimes, \"the district court will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence \nand to consult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or \nthe meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Teva, 574 U.S. at 331. \n\"Extrinsic evidence consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Markman I, 52 \nF.3d at 980. For instance, technical dictionaries can assist the court in determining the ordinary \nand customary meaning of a term because such dictionaries \"endeavor to collect the accepted \nmeanings of terms used in various fields of science and technology. \" Phillips, 415 F .3d at 1318. \nIn addition, expert testimony can be useful \"to ensure that the court's understanding of the \ntechnical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish \nthat a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.\" \nId. Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \"expert reports and testimony [are] \n3 generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer from bias that is not \npresent in intrinsic evidence.\" Id. Overall, while extrinsic evidence \"may be useful to the \ncourt,\" it is \"less reliable\" than intrinsic evidence , and its consideration \"is unlikely to result in a \nreliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the intrinsic \nevidence.\" Id. at 1318-19. Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope of the \npatented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper. See Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. \nHewlett-Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1583). \nFinally, \"[t]he construction that stays true to the claim language and most naturally aligns \nwith the patent's description of the invention will be, in the end, the correct construction. \" \nRenishaw PLC v. Marposs SpA, 158 F.3d 1243, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1998). It follows that \"a claim \ninterpretation that would exclude the inventor's device is rarely the correct interpretation .\" \nOsram GmbHv. Int'! Trade Comm'n, 505 F.3d 1351, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nB. Indefiniteness \nA patent claim is indefinite if, \"viewed in light of the specification and prosecution \nhistory,\" it fails to inform a POSA \"about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty. \" \nNautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments , Inc., 572 U.S. 898, 910 (2014). A claim may be indefinite if \nthe patent does not convey with reasonable certainty how to choose among multiple possible \nconstructions for a particular limitation. See, e.g., Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 789 \nF.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015). While definiteness is a legal question, any facts underlying an \nindefiniteness determination must be proved by clear and convincing evidence . See BASF Corp. \nv. Johnson Matthey Inc., 875 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \n4 III. DISPUTED TERMS2 \nA. \"detection device\"3 \nPlaintiff \n\"One or more touch and/or touchless devices such as but not limited to an infrared sensor, an \nelectrostatic induction sensor, a conduction-based sensor, a pad, a button, voltage divider or \npower interruption switch or a conduction rate of a phase controller set by a user that serves as \nan interface between a human and the controller \"4 \nDefendant \nMeans-plus-function / Function: \"detecting at least one external control signal and converting \nthe at least one external control signal into at least one message carrying sensing signal\" / \nStructure: Indefinite \nCourt \nMeans-plus-function / Function: \"detecting at least one external control signal and converting \nthe at least one external control signal into at least one message carrying sensing signal\" / \nStructure: Infrared sensor \nThe parties first dispute whether \"detection device\" is a means-plus-function term. \nUnder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(f), \"[a]n element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a \nmeans or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or \n2 The Court will adopt the parties' agreed-upon constructions of three other claim terms: \n\"free-running setting\" (claims 1 and 2 of the '362 patent); \"connected in series\" (claims 20 and \n24 of the '947 patent, claim 23 of the '902 patent, claim 2 of the '032 patent, claim 1 of the '362 \npatent, claims 15, 23, 36, and 79-81 of the '292 patent, claims 1, 2, 59, and 77 of the '691 patent, \nclaims 1 and 2 of the '916 patent, and claim 1 of the '719 patent); and \"wherein when the second \nset of M number LEDs is turned on upon detecting the motion intrusion , the loading and power \ncontrol unit manages to tum off the first set ofN number LEDs\" (claim 17 of the '902 patent and \nclaim 17 of the '292 patent). Although Vaxcel argues these terms need not be construed , the \nCourt agrees with HeathCo that construing them will be helpful as this case proceeds. (See D.I. \n69 at 8-9) \n3 This term appears in claims 1, 8, 20, 40, and 53 of the '503 patent. (D.1. 69 at 9) \n4 Alternatively , if the Court determines that this term is a means-plus-function term, then \nVaxcel agrees the relevant function is \"detecting at least one external control signal and \nconverting the at least one external control signal into at least one message carrying sensing \nsignal.\" (D.I. 69 at 16) According to Vaxcel, the corresponding structure includes \"an infrared \nsensor, an electrostatic induction sensor, a conduction-based sensor, a pad, a button, voltage \ndivider or power interruption switch.\" (Tr. at 12) \n5 acts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, \nmaterial, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.\" When the claim \nlanguage does not use the word \"means,\" there is a rebuttable presumption that\u00a7 112(\u00b1) does not \napply. See Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC, 792 F.3d 1339, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (en bane in \nrelevant part). Even when the claim language does not use the word \"means,\" however, \"the \npresumption can be overcome and [\u00a7 112(\u00b1)] will apply if the challenger demonstrates that the \nclaim term fails to recite sufficiently definite structure or else recites function without reciting \nsufficient structure for performing that function.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and brackets \nomitted). The \"essential inquiry\" is \"whether the words of the claim are understood by [a \nPOSA] to have a sufficiently definite meaning as the name for structure.\" Id. \nThe Court concludes that \"detection device\" is a means-plus-function term subject to \n\u00a7 112(\u00b1). In the context of the '503 patent, \"device\" is a \"nonce word\" that does not suggest \nanything about the claim element's structure. See id. at 1350 (\"Generic terms such as ... \n'device,' and other nonce words that reflect nothing more than verbal constructs may be used in \na claim in a manner that is tantamount to using the word 'means' because they typically do not \nconnote sufficiently definite structure and therefore may invoke [\u00a7 112(\u00b1)].\") (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). As HeathCo points out, this element is written in \"classic means-plus function \nformat\" because it uses a generic term followed by its purpose. (See D.I. 69 at 11) Indeed, the \nclaim language could have used the term \"detection means\" to convey precisely the same thing. \nSee Williamson, 792 F.3d at 1350. \nBecause \"detection device\" is a means-plus-function term, the Court must first determine \nthe claimed function. See id. at 1351. HeathCo proposes the function recited in the claim \nlanguage: \"detecting at least one external control signal and converting the at least one external \n6 control signal into at least one message carrying sensing signal.\" (See, e.g., '503 patent at 26:1-\n4) Vaxcel agrees with this articulation of the claimed function (see D.I. 69 at 16), and the Court \nwill adopt it. \nNext, the Court must determine whether the '503 patent discloses sufficient structure that \ncorresponds to the claimed function. See Williamson, 792 F.3d at 1351. Vaxcel points primarily \nto the specification 's discussion of the infrared ray sensor. (See D.I. 69 at 17-18) The \nspecification contains a detailed explanation as to how the infrared ray sensor may be used both \nto detect the external control signal and to convert it into a message carrying sensing signal. (See \n'503 patent at 7:41-44, 51-54; id at 10:11-65; id at 11:8-21; id at Figs. 2 & 3A) Given the '503 \npatent's extensive teachings, the Court concludes that an infrared sensor is sufficient structure for \na \"detection device.\" HeathCo has not shown that this means-plus-function term is indefinite. \nVaxcel argues, unpersuasivel y, that the specification discloses other sufficient structures. \nFor example, Vaxcel cites a portion of the specification that suggests that pressing a touch pad or \nbutton results in the generation of message carrying sensing signals. (See id at 21 :67-22: 15) \nWhile that portion of the specification indicates that the pad or button performs the claimed \nfunction, it does not offer any specific structure for either the pad or the button. It does not, for \nexample, cite any figures in the '503 patent that contain a pad or button. Vaxcel has not pointed \nto any other disclosure in the patent that teaches how a pad or button operates, nor is the Court \nable to locate such a disclosure. Moreover , V axcel has not offered any meaningful support for \nany other structures, which the patent mentions fleetingly. (See id. at 25:30-48) (referring to, \namong other things, voltage dividers and conduction rates) \n7 B. \"message carrying sensing signal\"5 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction is necessary . However , if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"One or more formatted signals interpretable by a processor , \nmicrocontroller or an ASIC (e.g., a signal having a voltage aspect and a timing aspect)\" \nDefendant \n\"a signal having at least a first voltage with a first time length and a second voltage with a \nsecond time length\" \nCourt \n\"One or more formatted signals interpretable by a processor , microcontroller or an ASIC ( e.g., \na signal having a voltage aspect and a timing aspect)\" \nThe only significant difference between the parties' proposed constructions is that \nV axcel' s construction permits the signal to have only one voltage aspect and one timing aspect, \nwhereas Heath Co's construction requires at least two voltages and two time lengths. \nV axcel' s construction is grounded in the claim language. Claim 1 states that the message \ncarrying sensing signal \"is characterized with a signal format of a short voltage signal, a long \nvoltage signal, a plurality of short voltage signals, a plurality of long voltage signals or a \ncombination of said short voltage signal and said long voltage signal.\" (' 503 patent at 26:29-34) \nIn this way, the claim language contemplates that the message carrying sensing signal may have \nonly a single voltage signal: \"a [i.e., one or more] short voltage signal\" or \"a long voltage signal\" \n(though it may, alternatively, have more than one signal). \nThe specification does not undermine V axcel' s position. It repeatedly explains that the \nmessage carrying sensing signal may have \"a first voltage with a time length\" that corresponds to \nthe time interval that an object is in the detecting zone. ('503 patent at 2:54-58, 2:64-3:1, 3:58-\n5 This term appears in claims 1, 8, 11, 12, 16, 20, 26, 40, 41, 53, and 56 of the '503 \npatent. (D.I. 69 at 20) \n8 62) While those embodiments go on to say that the message carrying sensing signal also has a \nsecond voltage corresponding to the object leaving the detecting zone, the specification is clear \nthat those embodiments are only exemplary. The exemplary embodiments are not limiting. See \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1320 (reading a limitation from the written description into the claims is \n\"one of the cardinal sins of patent law\") (internal quotation marks omitted). \nHeathCo points to one paragraph in the specification, which refers to the \"present \ninvention,\" as support for its construction. (See D.I. 69 at 22) Its reliance on that paragraph is \nmisplaced. The pertinent sentence states that \"[t]here are quite a few detection methods ... that \ncan be applied to the present invention.\" This sentence is most naturally read as listing the types \nof sensors that can be used for detection , not imposing any requirements on message carrying \nsensing signals. This one sentence does not amount to a clear and unmistakable disclaimer of \nclaim scope. See, e.g., Luminara Worldwide , LLC v. Liown Elecs. Co., 814 F.3d 1343, 1353 \n(Fed. Cir. 2016). Moreover, nothing in the cited paragraph of the specification purports to \nrequire every message carrying sensing signal to have more than one voltage and more than one \ntime length. It says only that time lengths are part of the invention 's \"core technology.\" ('503 \npatent at 21: 15-19) V axcel' s proposed construction incorporates this core technology by \nacknowledging that the signal may have a voltage aspect and a timing aspect. (See also Tr. at \n35) (conceding that message carrying sensing signal requires at least first voltage) \n9 C. \"external control signal\"6 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction is necessary . However, if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"A signal that is generated and processed by the detection device\" \nDefendant \nIndefinite \nCourt \n\"A signal that is processed by the [detection device/external control unit]\" \nAt this stage of the case, the Court has not been persuaded that \"external control signal\" \nis indefinite . HeathCo admits that its indefiniteness argument does not implicate the \"classic\" \nsituation in which competing claim constructions may produce conflicting infringement findings \nyet a POSA has no way to choose between the proposed constructions. (See Tr. at 58) Rather, \nHeathCo argues that plugging in one possible construction for the claim term makes sense, but \nplugging in a different construction would not make sense. (See id.) Claims must be \"read in \nlight of the specification delineating the patent.\" Nautilus, 572 U.S. at 901. HeathCo has \nprovided the Court with no evidence -nor has it even given the Court any reason to think -that \na POSA would have difficulty understanding the correct construction of this term. 7 Heath Co has \nnot demonstrated that \"external control signal\" is indefinite. 8 \n6 This term appears in claims 1, 8, 17, 20, 40, and 53 of the '503 patent, claims 27, 29, \nand 30 of the '902 patent, claim 30 of the '292 patent, claims 1, 7-10, 59, and 65-68 of the '691 \npatent, claims 1 and 4 of the '916 patent, and claim 12 of the '367 patent. (D.I. 69 at 25) \n7 HeathCo has not identified who qualifies as a POSA. (See Tr. at 60) \n8 The Court's ruling on this term today is without prejudice to HeathCo's ability to press \nan indefiniteness argument as this case continues , should it believe that it can offer sufficient \nevidence to meet its burden. See generally Otsuka Pharm. Co. v. Zenara Pharma Priv. Ltd., \n2021 WL 3172017, at *3-5 (D. Del. July 27, 2021) (reserving ruling on definiteness until after \nbench trial). \n10 Turning to V axcel' s proposed construction , Heath Co faults it for contemplating that the \nsame detection device would, confusingl y, both generate the external control signal and then \nprocess it. (D.I. 69 at 29) In response, V axcel agreed to drop the \"generated \" portion of its \nproposed construction (Tr. at 50), and the Court agrees this change is appropriate . HeathCo also \npoints out that the asserted patents do not all use the term \"detection device.\" (D.I. 69 at 29) In \nfact, this term appears only in the '503 patent, though the other patents use the term \"external \ncontrol unit\" to convey essentiall y the same meaning. (Tr. at 60) Thus, the Court's construction \napplies equally to \"detection devices\" and \"external control units.\"9 \nD. \"loading and power control unit ['LPCU']\"10 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction is necessary . However, if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"A circuit that includes at least a controller in electrical \ncommunication with switching circuitry \" \nDefendant \n\"a control unit that both controls the switches and controls the average current through the \nload\" \nCourt \nNo construction is necessary . \nThe parties have failed to persuade the Court they have a dispute over claim scope that \nthe Court can or must resolve. They have likewise failed to persuade the Court that either of \ntheir proposed constructions would resolve any such dispute. HeathCo 's proposal does not seem \n9 Notwithstanding that the term may be used differently in claims 1 and 4 of the '916 \npatent, the parties have not argued that the Court should construe this term differently for \ndifferent claims. \n10 This term appears in claims 20 and 21 of the '947 patent, claims 15-17 of the '902 \npatent, claim 1 of the '032 patent, claims 15-17 and 79 of the '292 patent, claims 1 and 2 of the \n'362 patent, claims 1 and 5 of the '719 patent, claim 9 of the '564 patent, claim 12 of the '367 \npatent, claims 1 and 59 of the '691 patent, and claim 1 of the '916 patent. (D.I. 69 at 32) \n11 to align with Heath Co's contentions that: (i) the LPCU must \"directly\" control the load and \npower (D.I. 69 at 34; Tr. at 69), and (ii) the LPCU must be physically separate from other \"units\" \nrecited in the claims (D.I. 69 at 35).11 Both parties also suggested modified constructions during \nthe hearing, to which neither party had a full and fair opportunity to respond. (See Tr. at 64, 70) \nUnder the circumstances, the Court has determined that no construction is necessary . If \nat a later stage of the proceedings either or both parties determine , in good faith, that this term \ndoes require construction, they shall approach the Court with their proposed construction(s) and \ntheir proposal( s) for how and when the Court should construe the term. \nE. \"a voltage V across each LED complies with an operating constraint of \nVth<V <V max featuring electrical characteristics of the LED\" 12 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction is necessary. However , if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"When an LED is operating , it operates within a voltage range \nbetween a minimum threshold voltage required to trigger an LED to start emitting light and a \nmaximum voltage across an LED to avoid damaging the LED that allows each LED to operate \nadequately and safely\" \nDefendant \n\"A voltage V across each LED in the LED load does not fall below Vth and does not exceed \nV max during operation \" / V th and V max are indefinite \nCourt \n\"A voltage V across each LED in the LED load does not fall below V th and does not exceed \nV max during operation\" / Defendant has not proved by clear and convincing evidence that Vth \nand V max are indefinite . \n11 The failure of Heath Co's proposed construction to fix what Heath Co contends needs to \nbe clarified in the claim language is ultimately immaterial , as the Court is not persuaded that the \nclaims require either the affirmative \"direct control\" limitation or the negative \"physical \nseparation\" limitation requested by HeathCo. \n12 This term appears in claim 1 of the '916 patent, claim 2 of the '032 patent, claims 1 \nand 79 of the '292 patent, claims 1 and 59 of the '691 patent, claim 23 of the '902 patent, and \nclaim 20 of the '947 patent. (D.I. 69 at 38) \n12 Although the parties initially offered different constructions for this term, during the \nhearing Vaxcel agreed it does not have any problem with HeathCo's proposed construction . (Tr. \nat 86) The parties' remaining dispute is whether V1h and Vmax are indefinite. (See id) \nAccording to HeathCo, V1h and V max cannot be reliably determined given the information about \nlight emitting diodes (\"LEDs\") contained in the corresponding data sheets and given differences \namong LEDs in particular \"bins.\" (See, e.g., D.I. 69 at 40-42) While HeathCo has provided \nattorney argument that selecting the maximum V max across an assortment of LEDs is impractical \nbecause each LED has its own V max (see Tr. at 78-79), it has not provided any expert support, nor \nhas it identified any other basis on which the Court could conclude, by clear and convincing \nevidence, that a POSA would fail to understand the claims' scope with reasonable certainty. The \nburden is on HeathCo to prove indefiniteness by clear and convincing evidence, see BASF, 875 \nF.3d at 1365, and at this point HeathCo has not met that burden. \nF. \"connected in parallel\"13 \nPlaintiff \n\"connection of components within a circuit in a manner in which there are multiple paths \nbetween/among which the current is divided and wherein the voltages across each parallel \ncomponent are equivalent\"14 \nDefendant \n\"connected to common points at each end; not in series\" \nCourt \n\"connection of components within a circuit in a manner in which there are multiple paths \nbetween/among which the current is divided and wherein the voltages across each parallel \ncomponent are equivalent \" \n13 This term appears in claim 20 of the '947 patent, claim 23 of the '902 patent, claims 1, \n2, 59, and 77 of the '691 patent, claims 1 and 2 of the '916 patent, claims 15, 23, 36, 79, and 80 \nof the '292 patent, and claim 2 of the '032 patent. (D.I. 69 at 46) \n14 This is Vaxcel's revised construction. (See D.I. 69 at 46, 49-50; see also Tr. at 90) \n13 The parties dispute whether components that are \"connected in parallel\" must be \nconnected to common points at both ends. The Court agrees with V axcel that Heath Co's effort \nto include such a requirement is overly restrictive. \nClaim 10 of the '902 patent contains the following limitation: \nwherein the first set ofN number LEDS and the second set of M \nnumber LEDS are connected in parallel, wherein the first \nswitching device is electrically connected in series between the \nfirst set ofN number LEDs and the power supply unit, wherein the \nsecond switching device is electrically connected in series between \nthe second set of M number LEDs and the power supply unit. \n('902 patent at 16:63-17:3) Vaxcel offers the following simplified depiction of this claim \nlimitation: \nNLEOS MLEDS \nPower \nSupply \nUnit Arst Seccnd \nSwttchfng Switching \nDevice Device \n(D.I. 69 at 50) \nHeath Co disagrees, pointing instead to its own annotated version of Figure 6 as a \npurported embodiment of claim 10: \n650\u2022-i --\n:-\" \n240 ~LED. ___ _. \n: 652 \nPS I \n! __________ j \nFIG.6 \n(Id. at 51) Contrary to Heath Co's view, the language of claim 10 does not appear to describe the \narrangement in Figure 6. \n14 Vaxcel finds further support for its construction in the invention's purpose, which is to \nuse two sets of LEDs to create a \"two-level security light\" with two modes, in which the LEDs \nemit different color temperature lights. ('902 patent, Abstract) Vaxcel's construction permits \nthe M number LEDs and the N number LEDs to be activated separately, allowing for the two \nclaimed illumination modes. HeathCo's construction would require the M number LEDs and N \nnumber LEDs to be either both on or both off, which would defeat the invention 's purpose. (See \nTr. at 94-95) \nMultiple dictionaries echo the key aspect ofVaxcel 's proposed construction, i.e., that a \nparallel circuit's current is divided between more than one electrical component. (E.g., D.I. 70-1 \nat JA-26 (defining \"parallel connection \" as one in which \"there are multiple paths among which \nthe current is divided\"); D.I. 70-3 at JA-263 ( defining \"parallel circuit\" as \"electrical circuit in \nwhich current is split between two or more parallel paths\"); id. at JA-268 (defining \"parallel \ncircuit\" as \"circuit in which current or flux divides into two or more paths before joining to \ncomplete the circuit\")) HeathCo points to different dictionary definitions, but they provide little \n(and plainly insufficient) support for its proposal. (See D.I. 70-1 at JA-12 (technical dictionary \ndefining \"parallel circuit\" as one in which elements, branches, or components are \"connected \nbetween two points, with one of the two ends of each component connected to each point,\" \nwhere \"branches\" with \"elements in series\" may still be parallel); id. at JA-71 ( computer \nnetwork definition of \"parallel\" including connection \"between the same pair of nodes\")) \n15 Plaintiff G. \"wherein the first switching device and the second switching device are \nconnected with the first set of N number LEDs and the second set of M \nnumber LEDs\"15 \nNo construction is necessary. However, if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"The first switching device is connected to the first set ofN number of \nLEDs and the second switching device is connected to the second set of LEDs\" \nDefendant \n\"The first and second switching devices are each connected with both the first set ofN number \nLEDs and the second set M number LEDs\" \nCourt \n\"The first switching device is connected to the first set ofN number of LEDs and the second \nswitching device is connected to the second set of LEDs\" \nThe Court's agreement with Vaxcel on this dispute largely follows from its agreement \nwith Vaxcel on the preceding term. The same claim limitation excerpted above in connection \nwith the preceding term also appears in claim 23 of the '902 patent. Claim 23 depends from \nclaim 15, where the disputed term that the Court is now construing also appears. Claim 23 \nfurther requires: (i) \"the first set ofN number LEDS and the second set of M number LEDs are \nconnected in parallel,\" (ii) \"the first switching device is electrically connected in series between \nthe first set ofN number LEDs and the power supply unit,\" and (iii) \"the second switching \ndevice is electrically connected in series between the second set of M number LEDs and the \npower supply unit.\" ('902 patent at 19:52-59) The Court's agreement with Vaxcel on the \n\"connected in parallel\" term renders Heath Co's proposal for the instant claim term implausible . \n15 This term appears in claim 15 of the '902 patent and claim 15 of the '292 patent. (D.I. \n69 at 52) \n16 H. \"creation of an aesthetic night scene\"16 / \"soft evening light to feature an \naesthetic night view around the living area both for indoor and outdoor \nneed\"17 / \"soft warm light to feature an aesthetic night view around the living \narea both for indoor and outdoor need\"18 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction is necessary. However , if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"at dusk the LED security light is automatically turned on by the photo \nsensor to perform the low level illumination \"19 \nDefendant \nIndefinite \nCourt \nIndefinite \nV axcel first argues that these terms do not require construction because they appear in a \nnonlimiting \"wherein\" or \"whereby\" clause. (Tr. at 112-13) Vaxcel did not raise this argument \nuntil the claim construction hearing. Even if it were timely, the contention lacks merit, as the \nclaim language indicates to a POSA that the \"creation of an aesthetic night scene\" is an \nimportant feature of the claims; it is one of \"two life-style innovations for performing a life-style \nlighting solution.\" ('947 patent at 18:60-62) Additionally, the \"wherein\" clause containing the \n\"aesthetic\" term was added during prosecution to secure allowance of the terms. (E.g., D.I. 70-2 \natJA-191 to -192) \nThe Court further agrees with HeathCo that \"aesthetic\" is subjective and, accordingly, the \n16 This term appears in claim 20 of the '947 patent, claim 1 of the '032 patent, and claim \n79 of the '292 patent. (D.I. 69 at 55) \n17 This term appears in claim 15 of the '902 patent. (D.I. 69 at 56) \n18 This term appears in claim 15 of the '292 patent. (See D.I. 69 at 56) \n19 Vaxcel also proposed the following alternative construction: \"an effect of the LED \nsecurity light being automatically turned on at dusk by the photo sensor to perform the low level \nillumination.\" (D.I. 69 at 56-57) \n17 claim term is indefinite. V axcel insists \"aesthetic\" is not subjective because it relates to the \n\"philosophy \" or \"science\" of \"beauty and ugliness,\" not to whether something is pleasing or \ndispleasing. (Tr. at 113-14; see also D.I. 69 at 59) This is unpersuasive, in part because of \nVaxcel's own reasoning elsewhere in its presentation. For instance, in the briefing, Vaxcel \nacknowledges that patents use \"aesthetic\" to \"differentiate the artful aspect of the light versus the \nfunctional navigation. \" (D.I. 69 at 59) The Court sees nothing in the patents, however, that \nwould provide a POSA with reasonable certainty as to how to differentiate between artful and \nfunctional aspects of light. Accordingly , Heath Co has shown that these claim terms are \nindefinite. See Nautilus, 572 U.S. at 901; see also Datamize , LLC v. Plumtree Software, Inc., \n417 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (holding \"aesthetically pleasing\" claim limitation was indefinite ). \nPlaintiff I. \"creation of a navigation capacity similar to a light house for guiding people \nto safely walk to a destination in an outdoor living area\"20 / \"create a \nnavigation capacity similar to a light house to help people move to a \ndestination without getting lost or encountering an accident\"21 \nNo construction is necessary. However , if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"at dusk the LED security light is automatically turned on by the photo \nsensor to perform the low level illumination \"22 \nDefendant \nIndefinite \nCourt \nIndefinite \n20 This term appears in claim 20 of the '947 patent, claim 1 of the '032 patent, and claim \n79 of the '292 patent. (See D.I. 69 at 61; see also Tr. at 132-33) \n21 This term appears in claim 15 of the '902 patent and claim 15 of the '292 patent. (See \nD.I. 69 at 61; see also Tr. at 132-33) \n22 Vaxcel also proposed the following alternative construction: \"an effect of the LED \nsecurity light being automatically turned on at dusk by the photo sensor to perform the low level \nillumination. \" (D.I. 69 at 62) \n18 The Court's analysis for this term is essentially identical to that described above with \nrespect to the \"aesthetic\" terms. The \"similar to a light house\" term is limiting because the claim \nlanguage emphasizes the importance of this feature and because the patent applicant added it \nduring prosecution to secure allowance of the claims. (E.g., D.I. 70-2 at JA-191 to -192) \nFurther, \"similar to a light house,\" just like \"aesthetic,\" is subjective . The patent specification \ndoes not explain how to determine whether navigation capacity is sufficiently \"similar to a light \nhouse\" to meet the claim limitation. Nor has Vaxcel offered any plausible method for making \nsuch a determination. The Court is persuaded that a POSA would not have reasonable certainty \nas to the scope of these clams. Accordingly , Heath Co has shown that these claim terms are \nindefinite. See Nautilus, 572 U.S. at 901; see also ACQIS LLC v. Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc., 2015 \nWL 1737853, at *8-10 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 13, 2015) (holding term \"similar in design\" indefinite \nbecause patentee \"was unable to articulate any point at which components ... would cease to be \n'similar\"'). 23 \n23 Another problem is that V axcel asserts the \"similar to a light house\" limitation means \nthe same thing as \"aesthetic night scene\" or \"aesthetic night view.\" (Compare D.I. 69 at 61 with \nid. at 55-56) This is contrary to the general understanding that different claim terms have \ndifferent meanings. See generally Ethicon Endo-Surgery , Inc. v. US. Surgical Corp., 93 F.3d \n1572, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1996). This further supports that both claim terms are indefinite. \n19 J. \"low [light] color temperature\"/ \"high [light] color temperature\"24 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction is necessary. However , if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"LED having a color temperature at or near 2700K\" / No construction \nis necessary . However, if it is deemed that a construction is required then the construction \nshould be: \"LED having a color temperature at or near 5000K\" \nDefendant \nIndefinite I Indefinite \nCourt \nIndefinite I Indefinite \nHeathCo has again persuaded the Court that a POSA would not have reasonable certainty \nas to the scope of these claim terms and they are, therefore, indefinite. V axcel' s originally \nproposed constructions ( contained in the table above) support this conclusion. Those proposed \nconstructions indicate a low color temperature is \"at or near\" 2700 Kand that a high color \ntemperature is \"at or near\" 5000 K. V axcel points to a single portion of the specification as \npurportedly providing a POSA reasonable certainty regarding whether an embodiment is \nsufficiently near these temperatures to meet the claim limitation . (D.I. 69 at 65) That portion of \nthe specification, however, states that \"high power lighting sources\" may have a color \ntemperature of 5000 K and \"low power lighting source( s ]\" may have a color temperature of 2700 \nK. ('902 patent at 11: 17-20) Those teachings do not necessarily mean that 2700 Kand 5000 K \nare, respectively , considered low and high color temperatures, or provide any guidance as to how \n\"near\" those temperatures an embodiment must be to practice the claims. \nIn addition to its initial constructions , V axcel has offered temperature ranges for these \nterms. (E.g., D.I. 69 at 68; Tr. at 137-38) These ranges are derived entirely from extrinsic \n24 Both terms appear in claims 15 and 29 of the '902 patent, claim 15 of the '292 patent, \nclaims 1, 59, and 65 of the '691 patent, and claim 1 of the '916 patent. (D.I. 69 at 64) \n20 evidence. (See Tr. at 139-40) Vax.eel points to non-patent references indicating a low color \ntemperature could be between 2700 Kand 3000 K, while a high color temperature could be \nbetween 4000 Kand 6500 K. (D.I. 70-4 at JA-354; id. at JA-357) Vax.eel also relies on a \nwebsite -www.lightbulbsdirect.com -which seems to indicate that low color temperatures are \ntypically between 2700 Kand 3000 Kand high color temperatures are between 3600 Kand 5500 \nK. (D.I. 69 at 64) As can be seen from this summary , Vaxcel's extrinsic evidence is \ninconsistent. The Court is persuaded that these claim terms are indefinite . See generally \nNautilus, 572 U.S. at 901; see also Signal IP v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 2015 WL 5768344, at \n*56-58 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 17, 2015) (holding indefinite \"relatively high and low efficiency \" and \nsimilar terms). \nK. \"much brighter day light\"25 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction is necessary. However, if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"LED having a color temperature at or near 5000K\" \nDefendan t \nIndefinite \nCourt \nIndefinite \nVax.eel's proposed construction of \"much brighter day light\" is the same as the \nconstruction it initially proposed for \"high color temperature. \" (Compare D.I. 69 at 69 with id. at \n64) This fact, in combination with the reasons the Court gave above in connection with the other \n\"color temperature\" terms, establishes that this claim term is also indefinite. A POSA would not \nknow with reasonable certainty how much brighter light must be to be considered \"much \n25 This term appears in claim 15 of the '902 patent and claim 15 of the '292 patent. (D.I. \n69 at 69) \n21 brighter.\" See Nautilus, 572 U.S. at 901. For example, assuming a starting color temperature of \n2700 K, it is unclear which temperature near 5000 K must be reached before the light would be \nconsidered \"much brighter.\" (See Tr. at 145-46) Vaxcel's argument that \"much brighter day \nlight\" is simply the effect of the M number LEDs emitting light with a high color temperature \nwould effectively read this limitation out of the claims, which would be improper. See Apple, \nInc. v. Ameranth, Inc., 842 F.3d 1229, 1237 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \nPlaintiff L. \"dual effect of security alert by means of creating drastic changes in both \nlight intensity from low to high and light color temperature from warm to \ncool upon detecting a motion intrusion\"26 \nNo construction is necessary. However , if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"Increasing the light intensity and changing the LED color temperature \nfrom at or near 2700K to at or near 5000K upon detecting motion\" \nDefendant \nIndefinite \nCourt \nIndefinite \nVaxcel's proposed construction suffers from the same problem regarding \"at or near\" \n2700 Kand \"at or near\" 5000 K as already discussed . The claim term \"drastic\" only exacerbates \nthe lack of reasonable certainty a POSA would have as to the scope of the claims. To the extent \nVaxcel is contending that a drastic change is merely the consequence of switching from a low \ncolor temperature to a high one, such an interpretation risks reading a limitation out of the \nclaims. See Apple, 842 F.3d at 1237. \n26 This term appears in claim 15 of the '902 patent and claim 15 of the '292 patent. (D.I. \n69 at 72) \n22 M. \"preloaded in a mobile device\"27 \nPlaintiff \nNo construction is necessary . However , if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"Loaded in a mobile device prior to the APP being used for setting an \noperating parameter \" \nDefendant \n\"loaded in a mobile device before the mobile device is purchased or first used\" \nCourt \n\"loaded in a mobile device before the mobile device is purchased or first used\" \nVax.eel's proposed construction effectivel y reads the prefix \"pre\" out the claim term \n\"preloaded .\" (See, e.g., D.I. 69 at 78) (Vax.eel: \"If a person loads an APP before purchasing the \nlight[,] that can be considered preloaded .\") It is indisputable that an application must be loaded \nbefore it can be used on a mobile device. Therefore , the claim requirement that it be preloaded \nwould tell a POSA that something other than just the necessary loading must occur. In fact, a \nPOSA would understand that preloading relates to the time in which the application must be \nloaded, and would specifically tell the POSA the application must be loaded before the mobile \ndevice is purchased or first used. Heath Co's multiple dictionary definitions provide additional \nsupport for its proposed construction . (E.g., D.I. 70-3 at JA-275 (\"to load ... information or a \nprogram onto a computer before it is sold or used\"); id. at JA-278 (\"already installed on a \npersonal computer at the time of purchase \")) \n27 This term appears in claims 1 and 9 of the '564 patent and claim 1 of the '367 patent. \n(D.I. 69 at 76) \n23 Plaintiff N. \"when a free setting motion of the free setting operator is ceased, the user \ninterface APP manages to generate the [at least one] operating variable \ncorresponding to [the selection of] the capacity operating rate (being \ndetermined] and accordingly operates to transmit a wireless instruction \nsignal carrying a message of the [at least one] operating variable to the \nlighting device\"28 \nNo construction is necessary. However, if it is deemed that a construction is required then the \nconstruction should be: \"As a result of the free setting motion of the free setting operator being \nceased, for example, after a user removes their finger from a virtual button, the user interface \napp generates the operating variable corresponding to the selection of the capacity operating \nrate and transmits a wireless instruction signal carrying a message of the operating variable to \nthe lighting device\" \nDefendant \n\"The moment when the free setting motion of the free setting operator is ceased, for example, \nthe moment a user removes their finger from a virtual button, the user interface app generates \nthe operating variable corresponding to the selection of the capacity operating rate and \ntransmits a wireless instruction signal carrying a message of the operating variable to the \nlighting device\" \nCourt \n\"As a result of the free setting motion of the free setting operator being ceased, for example, \nafter a user removes their finger from a virtual button, the user interface app generates the \noperating variable corresponding to the selection of the capacity operating rate and transmits a \nwireless instruction signal carrying a message of the operating variable to the lighting device\" \nThe primary dispute for this term relates to the first word, \"when.\" In Vaxcel's view, \n\"when\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship for two events; to HeathCo, \"when\" means that a \nfirst and second event occur instantaneousl y. The Court agrees with V axcel. \nThe claim language includes the phrase \"manages to generate\" and the word \n\"accordingly,\" which, in context, suggest a cause-and-effect relationship. Moreover, in other \nparts of the patent, the patentee expressly referred to things happening instantaneously or \nsimultaneously (e.g., '564 patent at 29:38-48), suggesting that the failure to do so clearly in the \n28 This term appears in claim 1 of the '564 patent and claim 1 of the '367 patent. (D.I. 69 \nat 80) \n24 term the Court is now considering means the patentee did not intend that meaning here. \nRelatedly , the parties dispute whether the \"when\" clause permits an intervening action \nbetween the ceasing of the free setting motion and the generation of an operating variable. (See \nD.I. 69 at 80-81) The Court concludes that it does not. Such an intervening action would be \nthought by a POSA to break the causal chain that the Court has agreed with V axcel is required \n(and as is reflected in Vaxcel's proposal to include \"as a result of' in the construction) .
