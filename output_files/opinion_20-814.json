No. 20-814-LPS \nJTVCC, et al., \nDefendants. \nMrs. Evonca S. Aliahmed, Sussex Correctional Institution, Georgetown, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nJune 13, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORAND UM OPINION fAJ P-~ \nSTARK, U.S. Circuit Judge: \nI. INTROD UCTION \nPlaintiff Mrs. Evonca S. Aliahmed (\"Aliahmed'') 1, an inmate at the Sussex Correctional \nInstitution in Georgetown, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.2 (D.I. 1) She \nwas housed at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center (\"JVCC'') in Smyrna, Delaware when she \ncommenced this action. She appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. \n(D.I. 6) The Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and 1915A(a). \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe Court docket indicates that Aliahmed is a Plaintiff. Aliahmed, however, is not a named \nplaintiff. The named Plaintiffs include All Transgenders at BWCI, JTVCC, SCI, and Gander Hill; \nAll Intersex At BWCI, JTVCC, SCI, and Gander Hill; and All Other Inmates at BWCI, JTVCC, SCI, \nand Gander Hill (together ''Plaintiffs\"). (D.I. 1 at 10) The Complaint states that Aliahmed falls in \nthe \"female category\" as \"all females (i.e., legally and medically recognized and not 'identified as') at \nany male orientated facilities of DDOC and DDOJ.\" (Id.) The Civil Cover Sheet states that the \nclaims are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for cruel and unusual conditions of confinement \nviolating all prison-applicable U.S. Constitutional Amendments. (D.I. 1-1) The Civil Cover Sheet \n1 Recently, Aliahmed changed her name to Cea G. Mai, as noted on the docket on April 5, 2022. \nThe Court refers to her herein by the name used in the operative pleadings. \n2 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived her of a \nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See \nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n1 also states that this is a class action, seeking $25 million in damages ,3 and is signed by Mrs. Aliahmed \nas attorney of record. (Id.) \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from \nsuch relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915( e)(2) (in forma \npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from governmental \ndefendant ); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions ). The \nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to a prose plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiffs proceed prose, their pleading is liberally \nconstrued and the Complaint, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards \nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automaticall y frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley v. \nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366,374 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319,331 (1989)); see also \nGrcryson v. Mcryview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002)). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputa bly meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or \ndelusional \" factual scenario.\"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d \n523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule \n3 The body of the Complaint also seeks injunctive relief. (D.I. 1 at 11-14) \n2 12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted \npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a \nPlaintiffs leave to amend, unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grqyson v. Mqyview \nState Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" BellAtL Co,p. v. Twomb!J, 550 \nU.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations \" are not required, a complaint must do \nmore than simply provide ''labels and conclusions \" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.\" Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Cata!Jsts LLC, 7 65 F .3d 306, \n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,678 (2009) and Twomb!J, 550 U.S. at 570). \nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See \nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect \nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nUnder the pleading regime established by Twomb!J and Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency \nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a \nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume \ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See \n3 Connel!J v. Lane Const Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task \nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id \nIV. DISCUSSION \nA. Non-Attorney \nThe Complaint is signed by Aliahmed, who is not an attorney. Even if Aliahmed considers \nherself as a named plaintiff, as a non-attorne y she may not act as an attorney for the other Plaintiffs. \nAliahmed may only represent herself in this Court. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654; see also Osei-Afaje v. Medical \nColl of Pennsylvania, 937 F.2d 876 (3d Cir. 1991) (non-lawyer appearingpro se may not act as attorney \nfor his children); In the Matter of Chojeckz~ 2000 WL 679000, at *2 (E.D. Pa. May 22, 2000) (\"Although \na non-attorney may appear in propria persona on his own behalf, that privilege is personal to him \nand he has no authority to appear as the attorney for anyone other than himself.\" ). \nB. Eleventh Amendment \nNamed State Defendants include James T. Vaughn Correctional Center (''JTVCC''), Baylor \nWomen's Correctional Institution (\"BWCI''), Sussex Correctional Institution (\"SCI''), Gander Hill \n(z:e., Howard R. Young Correctional Institution (\"HRYCI\")), and the Delaware Department of \nCorrection and Department of Justice (''DDOC and DDOJ\"). \nJTVCC, BWCI, SCI, and HRYCI fall under the umbrella of the Delaware Department of \nCorrection. See 11 Del. C. \u00a7 6501 et seq. The DDOC is a state agency that is immune from suit. See \nAnderson v. Phelps, 830 F. App'x 397, 398 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Korns v. Shanahan, 879 F.3d 504, 513 \n(3d Cir. 2018)). The DDOJ also has Eleventh Amendment immunity. See e.g., Alston v. Administrative \nOffices of Delaware Courts, 178 F. Supp. 3d 222,229 (D. Del.), ajfd, 663 F. App'x 105 (3d Cir. 2016). \n4 The Eleventh Amendment protects states and their agencies and departments from suit in \nfederal court regardles s of the kind of relief sought. See Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, \n465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984). \"Absent a state's consent, the Eleventh Amendment bars a civil rights suit \nin federal court that names the state as a defendan t.\" Laskaris v. Thornburgh, 661 F.2d 23, 25 (3d Cir. \n1981) (citing Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781 (1978)). Delaware has not waived its immunity from suit \nin federal court; and although Congress can abrogate a state's sovereign immunity, it did not do so \nthrough the enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Jones v. Sussex Corr. Inst., 725 F. App'x 157, 159-60 \n(3d Cir. 2017)); Brooks-M cCollum v. Delaware, 213 F. App'x 92, 94 (3d Cir. 2007). In addition, \ndismissal is proper because none of the State Defendants are persons for purposes of\u00a7 1983. See \nWill v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71(1989); Calhoun v. Young, 288 F. App'x 47 (3d Cir. \n2008). \nAccordingly , all State Defendants will be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii) \nand\u00a7 1915A(b)(2) based upon their immunity from suit. \nC. Medical Provider \nThe last named defendant is Centurion. (D.I. 1 at 9) The Court takes judicial notice that \nCenturion is the current contract medical health care provider for the DDOC. The Court liberally \nconstrues the Complaint as an attempt to raise claims against Centurion under a theory of \nrespondeat superior. \nWhen plaintiffs rely upon a theory of respondeat superior to hold a corporation liable, they \nmust allege a policy or custom that demonstrates deliberate indifference. See Sample v. Diecks, 885 \nF.2d 1099, 1110 (3d Cir. 1989); Miller v. Comctional Med Sys., Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1126, 1132 (D. Del. \n1992). In order to establish that Centurion is directly liable for alleged constitutional violations, \nPlaintiffs \"must provide evidence that there was a relevant [Centurion] policy or custom, and that \n5 the policy caused the constitutional violation[s] [Plaintiffs] allege.\" Natale v. Camden Cry. Con: Facility, \n318 F.3d 575, 584 (3d Cir. 2003) (stating because respondeat superior or vicarious liability cannot be \nbasis for liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, corporation under contract with state cannot be held liable \nfor acts of its employees and agents under those theories). \nThe Court has thoroughly reviewed the Complaint and finds in it no mention of Centurion. \nA civil rights complaint must state the conduct, time, place, and persons responsible for the alleged \ncivil rights violations. See Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005); Hall v. Pennsylvania State \nPolice, 570 F.2d 86, 89 (3d Cir. 1978)). Additionally, when bringing a\u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must \nallege that some person has deprived him of a federal right, and that the person who caused the \ndeprivation acted under color of state law. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. at 48. The Complaint raises \nno claims against Centurion. \nAs to Centurion, then, the Complaint is legally frivolous. Centurion will be dismissed as a \nDefendant pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and 1915A(b)(l). \nV. CONCL USION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint. The Court finds amendment \nwould be futile. An appropriate Order will be entered. \n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nALL TRANGENDERS AT BWCI,J1VCC \nSCI AND GANDER HILL, et al., \nPlaintiffs , \nV. : Civ. No. 20-814-LPS \nJ1VCC, et al., \nDefendants. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 13th day of June, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion \nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED as frivolous and based upon Defendants' immunity \nfrom suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (iii) and 1915A(b)(1) and (2). Amendment is \nfutile. \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case. "}
