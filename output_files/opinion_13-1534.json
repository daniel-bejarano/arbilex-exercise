{"case_name": "SRI Internation, Inc. vs CISCO Systems, Inc.", "case_number": "13-1534", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "05-13-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSRI INTERNATIONAL , INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCISCO SYSTEMS , INC., \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 13-1534-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nOn May 25, 2017, this Court entered judgment in this matter following a trial in which the \njury found Cisco willfully infringed SRI's patents. (D.I. 417; SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 254 \nF. Supp.3d 680 (D. Del. 2017) (\"SRI I\")). At that time, this Court denied Cisco's motion for JMOL \nofno willful infringement , finding, \"substantial evidence supports the jury's subjective willfulness \nverdict,\" and granted SRI's motion for attorneys' fees and enhanced damages. SRI I, 254 F. \nSupp.3d at 717, 723-24. Cisco appealed the judgment. On June 12, 2017, in anticipation of that \nappeal, the parties jointly stipulated , \nCisco has agreed that, in the event that any portion of the damages or other \nmonetary awards included in the judgment in this case is affirmed by the \nFederal Circuit, Cisco will pay the amount affirmed, if any, to SRI, as well as \nany corresponding post-judgment interest at a rate of 1.10% per annum \ncompounded annually (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961), within 30 days of the \nFederal Circuit's mandate. \n(D.I. 421). \nOn March 20, 2019, the Federal Circuit vacated this Court's denial of Cisco's motion for \nJMOL of no willful infringement , holding that the jury's finding of willfulness prior to May 8, \n1 2012 was not supported by substantial evidence. The Court of Appeals remanded the case \"to \ndecide in the first instance whether the jury's presumed finding of willful infringement after May \n8, 2012 is supported by substantial evidence.\" SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 930 F.3d 1295, \n1309-10 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"SRI IF'), cert. den., 140 S.Ct. 1108 (2020). The Court of Appeals did \nnot reach \"the propriety of the district court's award of enhanced damages,\" instead choosing to \n\"vacate the award of enhanced damages and remand for further consideration along with \nwillfulness. \" Id. at 1310. The Court of Appeals also vacated the attorneys ' fees award, for two \nreasons. The willfulness determination was a factor in the determination to award them, and the \ndistrict court had included one billing entry \"clearly included by mistake.\" Id. at 1311. In \nconnection with willfulness, the Court of Appeals directed the District Court to consider whether \n\"Cisco's conduct rose to the level of wanton, malicious , and bad-faith behavior required for willful \ninfringement. \" Id. at 1309-10. On September 18, 2019, Cisco paid SRI the portions of the 2017 \njudgment that the Federal Circuit had affirmed in SRI II, plus interest calculated at 1.10% pursuant \nto the 2017 stipulation , about $25,000,000. (See D.I. 467-1 Ex. 1 at 1; Ex. 2). \nOn remand, on March 18, 2020, this Court found, \"There is no substantial evidence that \nCisco's infringement was 'wanton, malicious , and bad-faith,\"' and therefore denied SRJ's motion \nto amend the willfulness judgment and to award enhanced damages. SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., \nInc., 2020 WL 1285915, at *4 (D. Del. 2020) (\"SRI III\"). In the same opinion, this Court \nnevertheless found the case was \"such an 'exceptional ' case ... that a full award of attorneys ' fees \nis justified,\" and granted SRJ's motion for attorneys ' fees and expenses. Id. at *5. Final judgment \nissued on April 1, 2020. (D.I. 451). It awarded $8,038,848.25 in attorneys' fees and costs (about \n2 $3,000 less than in the 2017 judgment). Both parties appealed. On April 9, 2020, in anticipation of \nthis second appeal, the parties jointly stipulated , \n(D.I. 457). Cisco agrees that, in the event that any portion of the award of attorneys ' \nfees and costs included in [the April 1, 2020] judgment is affirmed by the \nFederal Circuit, Cisco will pay the amount affirmed, if any, to SRI, as well \nas any corresponding post-judgment interest at a rate of 0.17% per annum \ncompounded annually (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961), within 30 days of the \nFederal Circuit's mandate. \nOn September 28, 2021, the Federal Circuit affirmed the grant of attorneys ' fees, reversed \nthe JM O L of no willful infringement , reinstated the jury's finding of willfulness , and reinstated the \noriginal award of enhanced damages. The Court held that substantial evidence supported the \nfinding of willful infringement , because \"the jury's unchallenged findings on induced \ninfringement , when combined with Cisco's lack of reasonable bases for its infringement and \ninvalidity defenses, provide sufficient support for the jury's finding of willful infringement for the \nperiod after May 8, 2012, when Cisco had notice of the patent.\" SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., \n14 F.4th 1323, 1329-30 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (\"SRI IV''),pet.for cert. pending, No. 21-1267 (Mar. 18, \n2022). The Court clarified, in keeping with this Court's analysis in SRI I, that the \"proper\" test for \nwillfulness does not require a finding of \"wanton, malicious , and bad-faith behavior,\" but merely \n\"requires a jury to find no more than deliberate or intentional infringement. \" Id at 1330. The Court \nof Appeals explained , \"Because we reinstate the jury's willfulness verdict, we likewise restore the \ndistrict court's award of double damages in SRI I.\" Id at 1331. \nThe Federal Circuit's mandate in accordance with its judgment issued on January 11, 2022. \n(D.I. 462). On February 10, 2022, Cisco paid the attorneys ' fees and costs ($8,038,848.25) with \npost-judgment interest ($25,478.70) calculated at 0.17% per annum, accruing from the date of this \n3 Court's April 1, 2020 judgment , per the 2020 Stipulation , and the enhanced damages \n($23,660,000), with post-judgment interest ($6,999.00) calculated at the then-applicable statutory \nrate of 0.08% per annum, accruing from the date of the Federal Circuit's September 28, 2021 \ndecision. (D.I. 466 at 4; D.I. 465-5 at 2). \nThe present dispute is how the post-judgment interest on the enhanced damages1 should \nbe calculated. SRI argues Cisco should have paid interest dating back to the District Court's \noriginal final judgment on May 25, 2017, at the rate of 1.10% per annum, as specified in the parties' \n2017 joint stipulation. SRI moves to enforce payment of post-judgment interest in accordance with \nthe parties' 2017 Stipulation. (D.I. 463). I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.1. 464, 466, \n468). \nSRI argues the 2017 Stipulation governs Cisco's obligation to pay interest from the date of \nthe SRI I judgment , at the 1.10% rate specified in the 201 7 stipulation. (D .I. 464 at 3 ). SRI further \nargues that, even absent the stipulation , the case law requires the same conclusion , because \"the \npurpose of post-judgment interest is to compensate the successful plaintiff for being deprived of \ncompensation for the loss from the time between ascertainment of the damage and the payment by \nthe defendant ,\" and, \"interest accrues from the original judgment unless it is 'completel y \nreversed.\"' (Id. at 4 (quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno , 494 U.S. 827, 835-36 \n(1990)) (cleaned up)). \nCisco responds that the 2017 Stipulation does not apply, because \"[t]he award of enhanced \ndamages in the 2017 Judgment was not affirmed in Cisco's appeal; it was vacated and remanded. \" \nThe parties do not dispute that the post-judgment interest on the attorneys ' fees award \nwas properly calculated pursuant to the second stipulation. (See D.I. 466 at 4 n.4). \n4 (D.I. 466 at 5). Cisco argues that the parties' second stipulation with respect to the appeal of S,RJ \nIll confirms the parties did not intend for the 2017 Stipulation to apply beyond the initial appeal \nof SRI I. (Id. at 7). Cisco argues that both parties agree the first stipulation applied to both enhanced \ndamages and attorneys ' fees, and therefore \"the only reasonable explanation \" for SRI's decision to \nenter into a new stipulation with respect to attorneys ' fees in April 2020 at a lower interest rate is \nthat both parties understood the first stipulation no longer applied. (Id. at 7-8). Finally, Cisco argues \nthe law does not support application of the 201 7 interest rate, because the legal basis for the \njudgment \"change[d] after appeal.\" (Id. at 8 (quoting Addie v. Kjaer, 836 F.3d 251, 259 (3d Cir. \n2016))). \nThe 2017 Stipulation states that Cisco will pay post-judgment interest at a rate of 1.10% \n\"in the event that any portion of the damages or other monetary awards included in the judgment \nin this case is affirmed by the Federal Circuit.\" (D.I. 421). The 2020 Stipulation, on the other hand, \ndoes not address the interest rate in connection with enhanced damages. (D.I. 457 (\"[I]n the event \nthat any portion of the award of attorneys ' fees and costs included in that judgment is affirmed by \nthe Federal Circuit ... \")). At the time, there was nothing to address, since I had decided that there \nwas no willfulness and thus no basis to award enhanced damages. Plainly, the 2020 Stipulation \ndecided nothing about the interest rate that would accompany an award of enhanced damages. \nThus, the 2020 Stipulation offers no support to Cisco for the proposition that the parties had agreed, \nand the Court had decided, that the interest rate should be 0.17%. \nSRI's argument that the 1.10% rate set in the 2017 Stipulation necessarily still applies is \nnot compelling either, because the 2017 Stipulation literally requires that Cisco \"pay the amount \naffmned\" by the Federal Circuit, and while the ultimate result was substantially equivalent to an \n5 a:ffirmance , in neither appeal did the Federal Circuit \"affirm\" the 2017 Judgment. Rather, in the \nfirst appeal the Court \"vacated\" it and in the second the Court \"reinstated \" it. SRI II, 930 F.3d at \n1312; SRI IV, 14 F.4th at 1332. Thus, the only thing about the two Stipulations that is clear to me \nis that they do not help Cisco. \nAssuming , without deciding, that the Stipulations do not mandate a result in favor of SRI, \nI nevertheless conclude that SRI has the better of the argument under controlling law. The Court \nof Appeals for the Third Circuit has addressed the issue before.2 In Addie v. Kjaer, 836 F.3d 251 \n(3d Cir. 2016), the Court resolved an issue of Virgin Islands law by analogy to the federal post\u00ad\njudgment interest statute. The Court explained, \"Whether postjudgment interest should run from \nthe date of the original judgment following the jury verdict or the post-remand judgment 'turns on \nthe degree to which the original judgment was upheld or invalidated on appeal.' \"Id. at 258 ( citing \nLoughman v. Consol-Pa . Coal Co., 6 F.3d 88, 97 (3d Cir. 1993) (interpreting the federal post\u00ad\njudgment interest statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961)). \"The application of this standard is fact specific,\" \nand where the Court of Appeals \"orders the original judgment reinstated in its entirety, post\u00ad\njudgment interest will accrue from the date of the first judgment .\" Id. at 258-59. \"Distilled to its \nessence, the inquiry is when liability and damages, as finally determined , were ascertained or \nestablished. \" Id. at 259. \"When the legal basis for the judgment changes after appeal, post\u00ad\njudgment interest properly begins from the time of the judgment after remand.\" Id. ( cleaned up). \n2 SRI relies in part on Transmatic , Inc. v. Gu/ton Indus., Inc., a Federal Circuit opinion, as \nauthority for when post-judgment interest should begin. 180 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Court \nin Transmatic makes clear, however, that because \"determining the correct dividing line for \ncalculating pre-and post-judgment interest\" is not \"a subject unique to patent law,\" such a \ndetermination is governed by regional circuit law. Id. at 1347-48. \n6 In Addie, the Court declined to award damages dating back to the original judgment \nbecause \"[a]lthough the amount of [plaintiff's] recovery ultimately was the same in the [first and \nsecond] judgments , the nature and legal basis for the judgments changed.\" Id. In the second \njudgment , on remand, the district court granted the plaintiff recovery on his unjust enrichment \nclaim, whereas the jury was not allowed to consider the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim in \ndetermining the damages award for the first judgment. On those facts, the Court of Appeals found, \n\"The final determination of liability and damages was not ascertained or established until [the \nsecond judgment] , and the district court correctly determined that this was the date from which \npostjudgment interest accrues.\" Id. \nWhile Addie is the most recent Third Circuit case interpreting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, the more \nfactually analogous case here is Loughman v. Consol-Pa. Coal Co., 6 F.3d 88 (3d Cir. 1993). \nThere, in brief, the jury found defendants liable for fraudulent conspiracy , fraud, legal malpractice , \nand RJCO violations , and awarded compensatory and punitive damages. Id. at 93.The district court \nthen dismissed the legal malpractice claim, vacated the RJCO judgment , holding it was insufficient \nas a matter oflaw, and ordered a new trial on damages. Id. The jury awarded a new damages award \nthat was subsequently reversed on appeal, where the Court of Appeals held, (1) the district court \nhad abused its discretion in ordering the new trial on damages, (2) the first award of punitive \ndamages was supported by the record, (3) the legal malpractice verdict should be reinstated , and \n(4) the district court properly found the RJCO claims insufficient as a matter oflaw. Id. \nUltimately , the Court of Appeals in Loughman found that post-judgment interest should be \ncalculated from the date of the first judgment , explaining, \"all the defendants accomplished in the \nfirst appeal was the elimination of the RJCO claims,\" and, although this \"eliminate[d] one ground \n7 of liability,\" \"[i]t did not affect the plaintiffs ' ultimate right to recovery, nor the amount of that \nrecovery, since the other bases for liability and compensatory damages, which were reinstated on \nremand, were reflected in the first judgments .\" Id. at 99. \nHere, it is even more clear that liability and damages, as finally determined , were first \nascertained or established in the original judgment. Neither the amount ($23,660,000) nor the legal \nbasis for awarding enhanced damages changed from the initial judgment in SRI I to the final \njudgment. (D.I. 416; D.I. 465-5). Cisco's argument that the legal basis for the award changed \nbecause \"[w]hen the Federal Circuit reversed this Court's remand determination of no willfulness , \nit justified the willfulness verdict on different grounds [than the district court in SRI I]\" is \nunavailing. (D.I. 466 at 8-9). In SRI IV, the Court of Appeals expressly \"reinstate[d] the jury's \nfinding of willfulness , and reinstate[d] the award of enhanced damages. \" 14 F.4th 1332. That the \nCourt of Appeals in SRI IV relied on a slightly different combination of evidence than the district \ncourt in SRI I in determining the willfulness verdict was supported by substantial evidence does \nnot mean the \"legal basis\" for the judgment changed. The \"legal basis\" for the enhanced damages \naward in both SRI I and SRI IV was a conclusion that the jury's finding of willfulness was supported \nby substantial evidence. That is more than sufficient to show \"the essential liability and damage \nelements\" of the final judgment were fully \"ascertained \" in the initial judgment. Loughman , 6 F.3d \nat 94. \nFor these reasons, SRJ's motion to enforce order on payment of post-judgment interest \n(D.I. 463) is GRANTED. \n8 The parties should jointly submit a proposed final order with post-judgment interest to run \nfrom the date of the 2017 Judgment, at the then-applicable statutory rate. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a)-\n(b). \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \nEntered this [ 3 day of May, 2022. \n9 "}
