{"case_name": "Colt International Clothing, Inc. v. Quasar Science LLC et al", "case_number": "22-213", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "02-17-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCOLT INTERNATIONAL CLOTHING , Inc., \nPlaintiff, \nV. Civil Action No. 22-213-GBW \nQUASAR SCIENCE LLC, et al., \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPending now before the Court is Defendants Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Warner \nBros. Entertainment Inc., and Fox Broadcast Corp.'s (collectively , \"Studio Defendants\") Motion \nto Stay Pending Determination of Validity and Infringement (the \"Motion\"). D.I. 52. The Court \nhas reviewed the parties' briefing, D.I. 53; D.I. 62; D.I. 77, and the First Amended Complaint (the \n\"Complaint ,\" D.I. 33). For the reasons explained below, the Court denies the Motion. \nPlaintiff Colt International Clothing, Inc. d/b/a Colt LED (\"Colt\") alleges that Studio \nDefendants and Defendants Quasar Science LLC (\"Quasar\"), and Cinelease , Inc. ( collectively with \nStudio Defendants , \"Defendants\") infringe seven patents (the \"Asserted Patents\"), including U.S. \nPatent No. 11,293,600 (the '\"600 patent\"), by selling, leasing to others, or using certain Quasar \nproducts. D.I. 33 ,r,r 22, 25-31, 36; D.I. 48. Colt accuses only Studio Defendants of infringing \nthe '600 patent. D.I. 33 ,r,r 118-24. Studio Defendants , Colt alleges, use certain Quasar Products \n\"in methods that infringe at least [nine] claims ... of the '600 patent.\" D.I. 33 ,r 119. \nStudio Defendants have filed both a Partial Motion to Dismiss, D.I. 51, and this Motion, \nand Quasar has filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss, D.I. 54. The Court entered a Scheduling Order \non December 2, 2022. D.I. 82. The parties must substantially complete document production by \nAugust 1, 2023, and must complete fact discovery by December 20, 2023. D.I. 82 ,r 4. \n1 \"Motions to stay invoke the broad discretionary powers of the court.\" Cellectis S.A. v. \nPrecision Biosciences , 883 F. Supp. 2d 526, 532 (D. Del. 2012). Courts generally consider three \nfactors to determine whether a stay is appropriate: (1) whether granting the stay will \"simplify the \nissues for trial\"; (2) the status of the litigation, particularly \"whether discovery is complete and a \ntrial date has been set\"; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non-movant to suffer undue \nprejudice from any delay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage. Am. Axle & Mfg., \nInc. v. Neapco Holdings LLC, 2021 WL 616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021). The parties agree \nthat these three factors apply here. D.I. 53 at 2; D.I. 62 at 1. \nColt argues that no Defendants other than Studio Defendants \"are faced with challenging \nthe infringement or validity of the [']600 patent. Staying this case as to the Studio Defendants ... \ncannot possibly 'summarily resolve all issues with regard to the Studio Defendants ,' as the Studio \nDefendants allege .... \" D.I. 62 at 7 (quoting D.I. 53 at 3). Studio Defendants respond that \n[ t ]he '600 patent is a method patent which relates to use of the Accused Products \nwhich Colt alleges infringe the utility patents [i.e., other Asserted Patents]. The \n'600 patent claims priority to these utility patents. Should the underlying patents \nbe held invalid and unenforceable , it would follow that the '600 patent would also \nbe invalid and unenforceable . Further, where Colt obtains a reasonable royalty \nrelated to the Accused Products from the manufacturer of these products [i.e., \nQuasar], its rights are exhausted as to the end-users of these products, and especially \nso where the method of use claimed by the '600 patent is identical to the method \nwhich Colt advertises as the primary use for its own products which it alleges \nembody the claims of the asserted utility patents. \nD.I. 77 at 2. \nHowever, at this stage in the case, the Court cannot determine whether a jury that finds \ninvalidity and non-infringement of the claims of the other Asserted Patents would also find \ninvalidity and non-infringement of the claims of the '600 patent. Indeed, \"the claims define the \nexclusive rights conferred by a patent, and the validity and infringement of those rights must be \nevaluated on a claim by claim basis.\" Ernie Ball, Inc. v. Earvana, LLC, 502 F. App'x 971, 976 \n2 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Also, patents in the same field may not be duplicative since the Patent Act \n\"precludes more than one patent on the same invention. \" Geneva Pharms., Inc. v. \nGlaxoSmithKline PLC, 349 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101). Thus, the \njury must separately consider infringement and invalidity as to each claim of each Asserted Patent \nin this case. \nTurning to the stay factors, a stay would-rather than simplify issues for trial--create an \nunnecessary and wasteful duplicate trial. Colt fails to provide any claim-by-claim justification for \nits bald assertion that the invalidity of the claims of the '600 patent \"would follow\" from the \ninvalidity of allegedly \"underlying patents.\" D.I. 77 at 2. Instead, another jury in a second trial \nwould need to review claims as to the '600 patent regardless of whether a first jury found Quasar \ninfringed the claims of other Asserted Patents. Also, a stay would prejudice Colt by delaying its \nopportunity to litigate its claims as to the '600 patent against Studio Defendants. Thus, even if the \nearly stage of this suit favors granting a stay, on balance, the stay factors weigh against granting a \nstay here. The Court need not consider the parties' other arguments. 1 \nTherefore, at Wilmington this \\ih day of February , 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \nthat Studio Defendants ' Motion to Stay Pending Determination of Validity and Infringement (D.I. \n52) is DENIED. \nGREGORYB. WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n1 The \"customer suit exception \" generally applies when there are multiple lawsuits and when the \ncustomer and manufacturer infringe the same patents, see, e.g., Pragmatus Telecom, LLC v. \nAdvanced Store Co., 2012 WL 2803695, at *1 (D. Del. July 10, 2012) (applying the exception \nwhere two lawsuits alleged infringement of the same three patents), but only Studio Defendants \nare alleged to infringe the '600 patent, D.I. 33 ,r,r 118-24, and all Defendants are in the same \nlawsuit here. \n3 "}
