Andrews", "date": "05-12-2022", "ocr_text": "1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nECOLAB INC. and ECOLAB USA INC. , \n       \n  Plaintiff s,    \n       \n v.        \n     \nDUBOIS CHEMICALS, INC ., \n \n  Defendant.    Civil Action No. 21- 567-RGA \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff s move to dismiss  Defendant\u2019s second counterclaim, breach of the implied duty of \ngood faith and fair dealing, and to strike Defendant\u2019s third affirmative defense, invalidity of the \nAsserted Patents. (D.I. 17).  I have considered the parties\u2019 briefing. (D.I. 18, 20, 23). \nI. Background  \nIn November 2018, Ecolab brought claims of patent infringement and breach of contract \nagainst  International Chemical Corporation (\u201cICC\u201d) . (D.I. 10 \u00b6 9) . In late 2019, while that  suit was \nstill pending, DuBois purchased certain assets of ICC . (Id. \u00b6 12). Ecolab moved to join DuBois as \na party to the 2018 litigation with ICC , and DuBois and Ecolab s ubsequently ended  that litigation \nby entering into a Settlement Agreement (D.I. 1- 1 Ex. A) effective March 24, 2020. ( Id.). \nEcolab brought the instant  suit against DuBois on April 23, 2021, alleging infringement of \nthe \u2019257, \u2019381, and \u2019215 patents  (\u201cthe As serted Patents\u201d) , as well as breach of the Settlement \nAgreement  by \u201cfailing to take the steps required by the Settlement Agreement, despite numerous \nextensions, and by continuing to provide dry lubricant to customers applying the lubricant to \nconveyors in a prohibited manner.\u201d (D.I. 1 \u00b6 \u00b6 24-76, 79-80). In its answer, DuBois asserts a  Case 1:21-cv-00567-RGA   Document 84   Filed 05/12/22   Page 1 of 5 PageID #: 17962 \n counterclaim  for the  breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and an affirmative \ndefense  of invalidity  of the patents . (D.I. 10 at 25, 31- 32). Plaintiff now moves to dismiss that  \ncounterclaim and to strike that  affirmative defense.  (D.I. 17).  \nII. Analysis  \nA. Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing  \nDuBois alleges Ecolab breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by refusing \nto disclo se which of DuBois\u2019s customers it contends have infringed the patents , \u201cunreasonably \ndemand[ing] DuBois cease sales of its lubricating products to its customers, even those customers \nthat have fully complied with the brush mandate,\u201d and bringing suit on the basis of DuBois\u2019s \u201cimmaterial\u201d breaches of the Settlement Agreement . (D.I. 10 at 30 -31).  \nEcolab moves to dismiss this  counterclaim under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing it fails as  a matter \nof law because all the conduct DuBois alleges in support of its claim is expressly contemplated \nand permitted by the Settlement Agreement. (D.I . l8 at 5).   \nThe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \u201crequires a party in a contractual \nrelationship to refrain from ar bitrary or unreasonable conduct which has the effect of preventing \nthe other party to the contract f rom receiving the fruits of the bargain.\u201d Dunlap v. State Farm Fire \n& Cas. Co., 878 A.2d 434, 442 (Del. 2005) (cleaned up). \u201cExisting contract terms control , \nhowever, such that implied good faith cannot be used to circumvent the parties\u2019 bargain, or to create a free -floating duty unattached to the underlying legal document,\u201d and, \u201cone generally \ncannot base a claim for breach of the implied covenant on conduct  authorized by the terms of the \nagreement.\u201d Id. at 441 (cleaned up). \u201cOnly when it is clear from the writing that the contracting \nparties would have agreed to proscribe the act later complained of had they thought to negotiate Case 1:21-cv-00567-RGA   Document 84   Filed 05/12/22   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 17973 \n with respect to the matter ma y a party invoke the covenant\u2019s protections.\u201d Id. at 442. In practice, \nas here, parties frequently allege a breach of this dut y as though it were a \u201cfree- floating duty .\u201d It \nconsequently leads to a disproportionate amount of preliminary litigation as it is rarely a viable \ntheory. \nThe Settlement Agreement \u2019s \u201cCovenant Not to Sue\u201d provision states , \u201cEcolab will not \nassert any claim against DuBois for infringement of the Ecolab Patents as long as DuBois is in \ncompliance with the terms of this Agreement.\u201d (D.I. 1- 1 Ex. A  at \u00a7 6).  In its Complaint, Ecolab \nspecifically alleges multiple instances of DuBois\u2019s non -compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement. (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17- 20, 79-80 (alleging DuBois failed to make timely requests for extensions \nas required by the Settlemen t Agreement, failed to complete tasks required by the Settlement \nAgreement, and continued to supply product to customers to apply dry lubricants in a manner that violates the Settlement Agreement and infringes Ecolab\u2019s patents) ).  \nDuBois \u2019s response is essentially that Ecolab\u2019s  allegations relating to DuBois\u2019s failure to \ncomply with deadlines set out in the Settlement Agreement are not \u201cmaterial\u201d and the more material  allegations of customer non- compliance are made \u201cunilateral [ly],\u201d  and \u201cnot in good \nfaith.\u201d (D.I. 10 \u00b6 31- 32; D.I. 20 at 6- 7).  \nI am not persuaded by DuBois\u2019s arguments. The Settlement Agreement addresses the issue \nof when Ecolab may sue. Thus, there is no need for an implied covenant.   \nDuBois alleges, Ecolab has  \u201cunreasonably demanded that DuBois cease sales of its \nlubricating products to its customers, even those customers that have fully complied with the brush mandate.\u201d (D.I. 10 \u00b6 30). DuBois does not explain, however, how such a request is \u201carbitrary or unreasonable\u201d  in light of Ecolab\u2019s  allegations of infringement by DuBois\u2019s customers, nor how it Case 1:21-cv-00567-RGA   Document 84   Filed 05/12/22   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 17984 \n harms DuBois, as DuBois has not alleged that it has stopped sales to any of its customers. \nTherefore, I do not find this allegation is sufficient to plausibly support a claim of breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.  \nDuBois\u2019s final allegation in support of its counter claim is that Ecolab refuses to tell DuBois  \nwhich of DuBois\u2019s customers are non-compliant. I agree with Ecolab, however, that  under  the \nexpress terms of the Settlement Agreement, such notification by Ecolab is optional. The Settlement Agreement provides, \u201cIf Ecolab identifies any alleged instances of non -compliance with the \nGuida nce by a customer or distributor of DuBois Dry Lube,\u201d \u201cEcolab may send a notice to\u201d \nDuBois . (D.I. 1- 1 Ex. A at \u00a7 3.3). The Agreement then gives Ecolab the  option to have its outside \ncounsel conduct an inspection of DuBois\u2019 records \u201cafter such notification, and a reasonable \nopportunity for DuBois to respond,\u201d but makes clear, \u201cThis inspection option is without waiver of Ecolab\u2019s right to pursue its concerns in any other manner, including without limitation through the \nfiling of suit, subject to the terms of this Agreement.\u201d ( Id.). Therefore, Ecolab\u2019s decision to bring \nthis suit to address its concerns about DuBois\u2019s noncompliance  rather than avail itself of the \noptional notification and inspection process is expressly contemplated by the Settlement Agreement and thus insufficient to plausibly support a claim  of breach of the implied duty of good \nfaith and fair dealing.  \nFor these reasons, Ecolab\u2019s motion to dismiss DuBois\u2019s counterclaim is GRANTED.  \nB. Invalidity  \nDuBois asserts invalidity of the Asserted Patents as an  affirmative defense. (D.I. 10 at 25).  \nEcolab moves to strike this defense, as the \u201cNo Challenge\u201d provision in S ection 9 of the Settlement Case 1:21-cv-00567-RGA   Document 84   Filed 05/12/22   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 17995 \n Agreement unambiguously bars  DuBois from challenging the validity of the Asserted Patents.1 \n(D.I. 18 at 10; D.I. 1- 1 Ex. A at \u00a7 9 (\u201cDuBois admits that U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,741,257, 7,745,381, and \n8,058,215 ( \u2018the Three Patents \u2019) are valid and enforceable in all respects. DuBois will not challenge, \nor participate in any action contesting, the validity or enforceability of the Three Patents.\u201d)). \nDuBois responds that it asserts  its invalidity defense as \u201ca contingent defense,\u201d because, if Ecolab \nis in material breach of the Settlement Agreem ent, DuBois would no long er be bound by its No \nChallenge provision. (D.I. 20 at 8- 9). \nA court may strike an affirmative defense where its insufficiency is \u201cclearly apparent.\u201d \nO\u2019Gara v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 2010 WL 3070211, at *1 (D. Del. July 30, 2010). Here, the insufficiency of DuBois\u2019s defense of invalidity is clearly apparent. A fter dismissal of DuBois\u2019s \nclaim of breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, DuBois has no justification for asserting a defense clearly  barred by the Settlement Agreement.  \nI agree with Ecolab that it would be prejudiced by the cost and burden of discovery on a \ndefense that is, at this time, clearly barred . Therefore, I will GRANT its motion to strike the \naffirmative defense of invalidity , without prejudice. \nIII. Conclusion  \nFor the reasons stated above, Ecolab\u2019s motion (D.I.17) to dismiss DuBois\u2019s second \ncounterclaim and strike DuBois\u2019s third affirmative defense is GRANTED.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nEntered this 12\nth day of  May , 2022. \n \n/s/ Richard G. Andrews ____ \nUnited States District Judge  \n \n1  Ecolab also moves to strike this defense on the basis of res judicata. I do not need to decide \nthat.
