No. 22-697- RGA-JLH \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION AND ORDER \nPending before the Court are two motions filed by  Defendant  Amgen  Inc.: its Motion to  \nDismiss ( D.I. 17) and its Motion to Stay (D.I. 27) .1  The motions are fully briefed (D.I. 18, 19, 28, \n34, 35, 36, 40, 41, 43, 47, 48), and I heard oral argument on January 6, 2023 (\u201cTr . __\u201d).   For the \nreasons below, I recommend that Amgen\u2019s motion to dismiss be  DENIED, and I order that \nAmgen\u2019s motion to stay is DENIED.  \nI.   BACKGROUND Plaintiff Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  (\u201cRegen eron\u201d) and Defendant Amgen Inc. \n(\u201cAmgen\u201d) are pharmaceutical companies.   They sell competing drugs in a class of drugs known \nas PCSK9 inhibitors.  PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibody drugs  that can help high- risk \npatients lower their LDL cholesterol,  aka \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d  Amgen\u2019s product is called Repatha\u00ae.  \nRegeneron\u2019s rival product is Praluent\u00ae.   \nEach company has patents covering the specific amino- acid sequence in its product.  \nAmgen also has patents with claims that cover a genus of antibodies that bind to specific residues \n \n1 Judge Andrews referred this case to me for all purposes through the case dispositive \nmotion deadline.  (D.I. 5.)  2 \n on PCSK9 and block it from binding to LDL receptors.  In a separate litigation, Amgen alleged \nthat Regeneron\u2019s Praluent infringed Amgen\u2019s genus claims .  The Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit held that Amgen\u2019s genus claims  were invalid for lack of enablement.  Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi , \n987 F.3d 1080 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  That case is now pending before the Supreme Court; oral arguments are scheduled for March 27, 2023.  Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi , 143 S. Ct. 399 (2022) (granting \npetition for writ of certiorari).   \nThis case also concerns Praluent and Repatha, but it is not a patent infringement case.  In \nthis case, Regen eron is the plaintiff , and it alleges that Amgen has violated the antitrust laws  by \nundertaking an anticompetitive c ampaign to drive Praluent out of the PSCK9 inhibitor market.  \n(D.I. 1  (Compl aint) \u00b6 13.)  The core allegation \u2014and the allegation that the parties\u2019 briefs focus \non\u2014is that Amgen is giving pharmacy benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d) rebates on other drugs \u2014\nspecificall y, its blockbuster drugs Otezla \u00ae and Enbrel \u00ae\n2\u2014in return for exclusive  or preferred  \nformulary placement for Repatha.3  According to the Complaint, the size of the rebates on Otezla \nand E nbrel , and the fact  that Otezla has monopoly power and E nbrel has market power , leave the \nPBMs with \u201c no viable choice \u201d but to accept Amgen\u2019s offer  and to exclude Praluent  from their \nformularies .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 113\u2013123, 148.)   \nRegeneron\u2019s Complaint is 102 pages long.  (D.I. 1.)  This  matter comes before me on a  \nmotion to dismiss,  so I must accept the allegations  in the Complaint as true and view them in the \nlight most favorable to Regeneron.  Because I write primarily for the parties and the District Judge, \n \n2 Otezla and E nbrel are not PSCK9 inhibitors.  Otezla is a psoriasis treatment.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 113\u2013\n118.)  Enbrel treats rheumatoid arthritis  and other conditions.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 119\u2013 123.)  \n \n3 A formulary is a  PBM\u2019s  \u201cofficial list of covered medications, which determines how \nmuch a pa tient will pay for them.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 47.)  3 \n I assume general familiarity with the allegations and terminology used in the  Complaint.  The most \npertinent  allegations are as follows.   \nAmgen\u2019s Repatha has monopoly power in the PCSK9 inhibitor market.  ( Id. \u00b6 110.)  \nAmgen\u2019s Otezla has monopoly power in the moderate -to-severe psoriasis market.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 113, \n117.)  Amgen\u2019s Enbrel h as market power in the rheumatoid arthritis market.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 122 \u201323.)  \n\u201cExpress Scripts (\u2018ESI\u2019), United Healthcare/OptumRx (\u2018UHC/Opt um\u2019), and CVS \nCaremark (\u2018CVS\u2019) are the three most dominant Third -Party Payors for both the Commercial and \nMedicare Part D segments of the PCSK9 [inhibitor] market and collectively account for more than \nthree quarters of all prescriptions filled in the United States.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 53.)  ESI Commercial accounts \nfor 15.27% of the total PCSK9 inhibitor market.  ( Id. \u00b6 96.)  Regeneron\u2019s Praluent was on ESI \nCommercial\u2019s formulary prior to August 2020.  (Id. \u00b6 76.)  I n June 2020, however, ESI told \nRegeneron that Amgen had offered it \u201csubstantial rebates totaling $210 million over two years and four months for Enbrel\u00ae, Otezla\u00ae, and Repatha\u00ae.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 78.)  ESI further \u201cacknowledged\u201d that  \nAmgen had tied rebates for the three drug products together and \nconditioned these rebates on exclusivity for Repatha\u00ae on ESI  \nCommercial\u2019s National Preferred Formulary.  For example, Regeneron was informed by ESI on a June 2020 call attended by senior level executives that Amgen\u2019s offer for Repatha\u00ae included \u201cother products that would provide much more financial incentives to ESI.\u201d  As a result, Regeneron was informed that Praluent\u00ae would be excluded from ESI Commercial\u2019s National Preferred Formulary unless it could match this $210 million rebate.  \n(Id.)   \nA rebate of $2 10 million over two years and four months comes out to approximately $90 \nmillion per year.  ( Id. \u00b6 89.)  If that $90 million in annual rebates  is attributed only to sales of \nRepatha, it results in Repatha being priced \u201cfar lower than any appropriate estima te of Amgen\u2019s \ncorresponding costs.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 89 \u201394.)  T o match Amgen\u2019s $90 million annual rebates to ESI 4 \n Commercial, Regeneron would have had to sell Praluent at a loss.  ( Id. \u00b6 79.)  \u201cNor [was]  \nRegeneron able to match Amgen\u2019s bundled rebate by offering an  equivalent bundle across its \nportfolio, which lacks the massive products subject to PBM rebating that could offset Amgen\u2019s \ncoercive rebates for Otezla\u00ae or Enbrel\u00ae.\u201d  ( Id.)  Because Regeneron did not match Amgen\u2019s \nrebate offer,  ESI Commercial made the deal  with Amgen, and, \u201c [s]ince January 1, 2021 and \nthrough at least January 1, 2023, ESI Commercial\u2019s National Preferred Formulary . . . allow [ed] \nonly Repatha\u00ae to be covered for consumers whose plans follow ESI Commercial\u2019s National Preferred Formulary.\u201d\n4  (Id. \u00b6 80.)  \n Regeneron makes similar allegations regarding  UHC/Optum , which has 7.05% of the \nPCSK9 inhibitor market .  (Id. \u00b6 96.)  Prior to Se ptember 2021, UHC/Optum\u2019s Commercial \nFormulary allowed members covered by UHC/Optum to be prescribed either Repatha or Praluent.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 83\u201384.)  \u201cStarting on September 1, 2021, U HC Commercial moved to an exclusive \nrelationship with Repatha\u00ae, and, starting on January 1, 2022, Optum Commercial also moved to an exclusive relationship with Repatha\u00ae.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 84.)  \u201cRegeneron was . . . informed by \nUHC/Optum in May 2021 during negotiations for formulary access that there were further negotiations happening behi nd the scenes with Amgen,\u201d and Regeneron believes that \u201cAmgen \nopted to structure its rebate offer to UHC/Optum similar to its offer to ESI Commercial, using a portfolio of drugs across multiple therapeutic drug classes to secure Repatha\u00ae\u2019s exclusive \npositi on, where the effective price of Repatha\u00ae in the bundle was below cost.\u201d  ( Id.) \n \n4 Repatha also has an exclusive position with ESI Part D, which has 7.7% of the PCSK9 \ninhibitor market.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 81, 96.)  Regeneron does not allege that Amgen gave ESI Part D a bundled \nrebate.  Rather, Regeneron  alleges , \u201c[u]pon information and belief, [ that] Amgen\u2019s conduct \ndirected at ESI Commercial drove ESI\u2019s Part D formulary decision to exclude Praluent\u00ae\u201d because \n\u201cformulary access decisions for [commercial and Part D plans] are generally made on a consistent or uniform basis in the interest of administrative convenience and efficiency.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 81.)   5 \n  Regeneron has also been told in \u201c negotiations with other Third- Party Payors that Amgen \nmade a broad portfolio offer for Repatha\u00ae that would allow for a higher absolute rebate value with \nthe anti -inflammatory therapeutic class, i.e. , Otezla\u00ae and Enbrel\u00ae.\u201d   (Id. \u00b6 86.)  As of January \n2022, Praluent was \u201c\u2018not covered\u2019 on formularies of Payors accounting for at least 50% of the total prescriptions in the PCSK9 [inhibitor] market.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 96.)   Regeneron says that, \u201cstarting in 2022, \n[it] will no longer even be able to make a profit selling Praluent\u00ae\u201d and that it is being \u201cforc[ed] . . . to consider investing its resources elsewhere with an exit from the market altogether.\u201d  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 101, 137, 138 (\u201cAmgen\u2019s below -cost pricing and conditional bundled rebate scheme is already \npushing Praluent\u00ae below a critical mass of market share necessary to compete for access and \nremain viable . . . .\u201d) , 149.)   \nII.   LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA.   Motion t o Dismiss  \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201cfactual content that allows the court to dra w the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\u201d  Id.  A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.   \u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \n\u2018merely consistent with\u2019 a defendant\u2019s liability, it \u2018stops short of the line b etween possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\u2019\u201d  Id.  (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 557).  In determining the \nsufficiency of the complaint under the plausibility standard, all \u201cwell -pleaded facts\u201d are assumed \nto be true, but legal conclusions are not.  Id. at 679.  6 \n \u201c[W]hen the allegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement \nto relief, this basic deficiency should be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and \nmoney by the parties and the court.\u201d  T wombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (internal marks omitted).  \n\u201cAntitrust claims in particular must be reviewed carefully at the pleading stage because false condemnation of competitive conduct threatens to \u2018chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to pr otect.\u2019\u201d  In re Keurig Green Mt. Singleserve Coffee Antitrust Litig. , 383 F. Supp. 3d \n187, 218 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting Verizon Commc\u2019ns. Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 414 (2004)).  However, the same Twombly plausibility stand ard applies.  W. \nPenn Allegheny Health Sys., Inc. v. UPMC , 627 F.3d 85, 98 (3d Cir. 2010) (\u201c[I]t is inappropriate \nto apply Twombly \u2019s plausibility standard with extra bite in antitrust and other complex cases.\u201d).  \nB.   Motion to Stay \nA district court has br oad discretion to grant or deny a motion to stay.  Apotex, Inc. v. Senju \nPharma Co., 921 F. Supp. 2d 308, 313 (D. Del. 2013).  In exercising their discretion, courts in this \ndistrict generally consider  (1) whether a stay will simplif y the issues for trial, (2) whether discovery \nis complete and a trial date has been set, and (3)  whether  a stay would cause the non -movant to \nsuffer undue prejudice from any delay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage.  Id. \nIII.   RECOMMEN DATION ON THE MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCounts One through Six of the Complaint allege that Amgen violated Sections 1 and 2 of \nthe Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act.  In order to establish an antitrust violation under \nany of those three statutes, a plai ntiff must show (among other things) that (1) the defendant 7 \n engaged in anticompetitive conduct , and (2) the plaintiff suffered antitrust injury as a result.5   \nEisai, Inc. v. Sanofi Aventis U.S., LLC , 821 F.3d 394, 403 (3d Cir. 2016); ZF Meritor, LLC v. \nEaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 269 n.9 (3d Cir. 2012).  Amgen says that the federal antitrust claims  \nshould be dismissed because it did not engage in anticompetitive conduct .   \n\u201c\u2018Anticompetitive conduct\u2019 can come in too many different forms, and is too dependent on \ncontext, for any court or commentator ever to have enumerated all the varieties.\u201d  LePage\u2019s Inc. v. \n3M, 324 F.3d 141, 152 (3d Cir. 2003) (citation omitted).  Examples of agreements that may \nconstitute anticompetitive conduct include exclusive dealing arrangements, United States v. \nDentsply Int\u2019l, Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2005), and tying agreements, Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 482 (1992).  Certain types of pricing behavior can also \nconstitute anticompetitive conduct.  For example, setting prices below one\u2019s costs can constitute anticompetitive predatory pricing (if other requirements are met).  Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 222\u201323 (1993).  The Third Circuit (but not  the Supreme \nCourt) has also held that offering bundled discounts can constitute anticompetitive conduct.  LePage\u2019s , 324 F.3d at 154\u201358. \n \n5 As the Third Circuit has explained,  \nSections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton \nAct each include an anticompetitive conduct element, although each statute articulates that element in a slightly different way.  Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must establis h that the \ndefendant was a party to a contract, combination or conspiracy that \u201cimposed an unreasonable restraint on trade.\u201d  Under Section 2, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant willfully acquired or maintained its monopoly power in the releva nt market. . . .  Finally, \nSection 3 of the Clayton Act makes it unlawful for a person to enter into an exclusive dealing contract where the effect of such an agreement is to substantially lessen competition or create a monopoly. \nZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton C orp., 696 F.3d 254, 269 n.9 ( 3d Cir. 2012) (internal citations \nomitted) .  \n 8 \n There are legal rules that go vern the assessment  of each of these theories of anticompetitive \nconduct.  Still, challenged conduct \u201cmay be susceptible to more than one court -defined category.\u201d  \nViamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Corp., 951 F.3d 429, 453 (7th  Cir. 2020).  \u201cAt bottom, the purpose  of \nidentifying these categories of conduct is to help determine \u2018the presence or  absence of harmful \neffects, which are both the reason for any antitrust concern and often the simplest element to \ndisprove.\u2019 \u201d  Id. (quoting Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of \nAntitrust Principles and Their Application \u00b6  1701d, at 33 (4th ed. 2015)).  \nA. The Court should not consider Amgen\u2019s extra -Complaint evidence.  \nAs mentioned above, Regeneron\u2019s core allegation is that Amgen gave PBMs big rebates \non Otezla and Enbrel in return for  Praluent being excluded (or getting less prefe rable placement)  \non the  formularies.  Amgen\u2019s primary  argument for dismiss al\u2014which Amgen devotes almost all  \nof its briefing to \u2014is essentially  this: It didn\u2019t happen.   \nThe problem with that argument , of course, is that we are  at the motion to dismiss stage .  \nAt this stage, the Court does not get to decide who to believe.   The law requires the Court to credit \nRegeneron\u2019s version of the facts and to view them in the light most favorable to it.  And the  factual \nallegations in Regeneron\u2019s Complaint make it plausible  that Amgen  gave ESI and UHC/Optum \nrebates on Otezla and Enbrel that  were conditioned on exclusive formulary placement for Repatha.   \n Amgen submitted with its motion to dismiss documents that it asserts are the agreements  \nbetween it and ESI and UHC/Optum .  But \u201c[t]o decide a motion to dismiss, courts generally \nconsider only the allegations contained in the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint and \nmatters of public record.\u201d  Schmidt v. Skolas , 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014) (citations omitted).  \nThe documents submitted by Amgen are none of those things.   9 \n Amgen rightly points out that  there is an exception that allows courts to consider \nundisputedly authentic documents that are integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint.  \nId.  But that exception doesn\u2019t apply here , for a couple of reasons.  For one thing, Regeneron does \nnot concede that the documents supplied to the C ourt are authentic or that they represent the entire \nagreement s between Amgen and the PBMs.  An antitrust defendant cannot get a  case dismissed \nbefore discovery simply by submitting to the court  a written document (over the plaintiff\u2019s \nobjection) that the defendant  contends  is its  entire agreement  with a third party , where the court \nand the plaintiff have no way of  testing that contention .   \nMoreover , permitting Amgen to int roduce  extra- Complaint material at the motion to \ndismiss stage doesn\u2019t jibe  with the  purpose of the integral documents exception, which is to \u201cavoid \nthe situation where a plaintiff \u2018selected only portions of documents that support their claims, while omitting portions of those very documents that weaken\u2014or doom \u2014their claims .\u2019\u201d  T omaszewski \nv. Trevena, Inc. , 482 F. Supp. 3d 317, 328 (E.D. Pa. 2020)  (quoting Khoja v. Orexigen \nTherapeutics, Inc., 899 F.3d 988, 1002 (9th Cir. 2018));  see also Schmidt , 770 F.3d at  250 (\u201c[T]he \njustification for the integral documents exception is that it is not unfair to hold a plaintiff accountable for the contents of documents it must have used in framing its complaint, nor should a plaintiff be able to evade accountability for such documents simply by not attaching them to his complaint.\u201d).  Prior to filing this case, Regeneron did not have access to the documents Amgen has now submitted to the Court .  And Regeneron \u2019s claims  are not based upon the documents \nsubmitted by Amgen.  Regener on\u2019s claims are based upon i ts plausible allegation  that Amgen \nagreed with PBMs that  Repatha would get exclusive formulary position in exchange for  rebates \non other drugs ; such an agreement  could have been memorialized in a document not  presently  \nbefore th e Court, or  it might not have been written down at all.  10 \n In sum, I disagree that the documents submitted by Amgen are integral to or  relied upon \nby Regeneron such that the Court may consider them when resolving Amgen\u2019s motion to dismiss . \nThose documents ar e not considered further  below .   \nB. Amgen\u2019s remaining arguments  for dismissing the federal antitrust claims  \nimplicate factual matters not suitable for resolution on a motion to dismiss . \n \nOnce Amgen\u2019s extra- Complaint documents are removed from the analysis, most  of its \narguments fall away , as the documents are repeatedly referenced throughout Amgen\u2019s briefing.  \n(See D.I. 18 (Amgen Opening Br.)  at 8 ( Standard of R eview), 9\u201324 (Argument ); D.I. 40 (Amgen \nReply Br.)  at 2\u201311 (Argument )).  To the extent t hat any of Amgen\u2019s arguments remain, I \nrecommend rejecting them and denying its request to dismiss the federal antitrust claims.  \n1. Exclusive dealing  \nAmgen says that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege anticompetitive conduct under an \nexclusive dealing theory.  In an exclusive dealing arrangement, \u201ca buyer agrees to purchase certain \ngoods or services only from a particular seller for a certain period of ti me.\u201d  ZF Meritor , 696 F.3d \nat 270.  While an exclusive dealing claim requires a showing of an agreement between the buyer \nand seller, an express exclusivity provision is not necessary.  Id at 282.  \u201c De facto  exclusive dealing \nclaims are cognizable under th e antitrust laws\u201d where the effect of the agreement \u201cin the real \nworld\u201d demonstrates that competitors are excluded from a substantial share of the relevant market.  Id. at 270\u201372, 282\u201383.  \nThe legality of an exclusive dealing arrangement is judged under the  rule of reason.  Id. at \n271.  Whether an arrangement is legal \u201cdepends on whether it will foreclose competition in such a substantial share of the relevant market so as to adversely affect competition.\u201d  Id.  The Third Circuit has explained the analysis as follows:  11 \n There is no set formula for evaluating the legality of an exclusive \ndealing arrangement, but modern antitrust law generally requires a showing of [1] significant market power by the defendant, [2] substantial foreclosure, [3] contracts of suffic ient duration to \nprevent meaningful competition by rivals, and [4] an analysis of likely anticompetitive effects considered in light of any procompetitive effects.  Courts will also consider [5] whether there is evidence that the dominant firm engaged in c oercive behavior, \nand [6] the ability of customers to terminate the agreements.  [7] The use of exclusive dealing by competitors of the defendant is also sometimes considered.  \n \nId. at 271\u201372 (cleaned up); see also In re EpiPen (Epinephrine Injection, USP) Marketing, Sales \nPractices and Antitrust Litig. , 44 F.4th  959, 988 n.9 (10th  Cir. 2022).  \n Amgen  offers five reasons why  Regeneron \u2019s antitrust claims fail when assessed under an \nexclusive dealing theory.   First, Amgen  says that  its rebate agreements with some PBMs do not \ncondition rebates on Repatha exclusivity.  But the Complaint plausibly alleges , at a minimum, that \nAmg en\u2019s deals with ESI Commercial and UHC/Optum do condition rebates  on other drugs in \nexchange for Repatha exclusivity.  \n Second, Amgen argues that the Complaint fails to allege that its agreements with PBMs \nresult in  Praluent being \u201csubstantially foreclosed\u201d from the market .  E ven setting aside \nRegeneron\u2019s allegations about ESI Part D and so -called \u201cspillover\u201d foreclosure at the payor and \nprescriber levels , Regeneron has pleaded exclusive dealing arrangements with  ESI Commercial \nand UHC/Optum , which have 15.27% and 7.05% of the market, res pectively , for a total of 22.32% .  \nI am not prepared to say at this stage of the case  that plausibly pleading contracts resulting in \nforeclosure of at least  22.32% is insufficient as a matter of law to state an antitrust claim, \nparticularly since the Complaint also alleges that Repatha has monopoly power and is \u201cnot 12 \n covered\u201d on the formularies of payors accounting for at least 50% of the total prescriptions in the \nPCSK9 inhibitor market .6    \n Third, Amgen argues  that the Complaint fails to plead  that its contracts are of sufficient \nduration to be anticompetitive.  But  whether an exclusive dealing arrange ment  is lawful because \nit is of short -term in duration or easily terminable is another factual dispute that is \u201c ill suited for \nthe pleadings stage.\u201d  FTC v. Surescripts, LLC , 424 F. Supp. 3d 92, 104 (D.D.C. 2020)  (rejecting \nargument that exclusive dealing claim should be dismissed where the pertinent contracts were easily terminable and of short duration) ; see also  3Shape Trios A/S v. Align Tech., Inc., No. 18-\n1332- LPS, 2020 WL 6938054, at *2 (D. Del. Nov. 25, 2020)   (\u201c[T]he Third Circuit has declined \nto take the position that the short duration and ease of termination of exclusive dealing contracts mean such agreements cannot violate the antitrust laws .\u201d). \n \n6  Contrary to Amgen\u2019s suggestion, the Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in ZF Meritor  does not say \nthat a complaint must plead specific contracts resulting in 40% to 50% foreclosure in order to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss.  (Tr. 21 , 65\u201366.)   That case does say that \u201c 40% to 50% foreclosure is \nusually required to establish an exclusive dealing violation under Section 1 of the Sherman Act,\u201d \nbut it doesn\u2019t purport to establish a pleading standard for all types of antitrust claims .  ZF Meritor , \n696 F.3d at 286.  Moreover, saying that at least 40% is \u201cusually\u201d required to establish a violation \nis not the same thing as saying that it is required, and the case s ets forth a number of additional \nfactors  relevant to the analysis .  Id. at 271\u201372.  Indeed, other courts have suggested that a smaller  \npercentage of market foreclosure could be sufficient in combination with other relevant market \nconditions.  See, e.g., United States v. Microsoft , 253 F.3d 34, 70 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (\u201c[W]e agree \nwith plaintiffs that a monopolist\u2019s use of exclusive contracts, in certain circumstances, may give rise to a \u00a7 2 violation even though the contracts foreclose less than the roughly 40% or 50% share \nusually required in order to establish a \u00a7 1 violation .\u201d);  Am. Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., \n521 F.2d 1230, 1252 (3d Cir. 1975) (explaining that for eclosure of 14.7% \u201cmay well offend the \nlimitations which the Clayton Act places on exclusive contracts\u201d when considered in combination with other market factors) .  Because the  legality of an exclusive dealing arrangement is judged \nunder the rule of reason,  it \u201cusually requires some fairly detailed facts, the ascertainment of which \nis often beyond the scope of a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry.\u201d  Vazquez -Ramos v. Triple -S Salud, Inc., 55 \nF.4th 286, 299 (1st Cir. 2022) ; see also  In re Surescripts Antitrust Litig., No. 19- 6627, 2022 WL \n2208914, at *16\u201317 (N. D. Ill. June 21, 2022) (holding that allegation of 20% foreclosure wa s \nsufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss ). 13 \n Fourth, Amgen argues that the Complaint fails to allege coercion.  Amgen\u2019s argument, \nhowever, is p remised on its factual assertion that \u201cno Otezla\u00ae rebates at all are conditioned on \nRepatha\u00ae coverage\u201d (D.I. 18 at 17), which, as noted above, is  contrary to the plausi ble allegations \nin the Complaint.  Amgen\u2019s arguments regarding Enbrel  likewise  involve factual disputes and \ninvoke extra- Complaint evidence that  the Court will not consider.  \n Fifth, Amgen points out that Regeneron itself engages in exclusive dealing arrangements \nfor Praluent.   Even if true, that \u2019s not enough to get Amgen off the hook at this stage .  The Third \nCircuit says that the use of exclusive dealing by competitors of the defendant  is only \u201csometimes\u201d \nconsidered and, even then, it is only one factor in the fact -intensive analysis.  ZF Meritor , 696 F.3d \nat 271\u201372.  And nothing i n the record properly before the Court suggests that Regeneron has itself \noffered  the kind of multi- product  bundled discount arrangement alleged  in the Complaint . \n In sum, Amgen\u2019s arguments about  exclusive dealing all implicate  factual disputes that \ncannot be resolved at this stage of the case.7  Further factual development may reveal that Amgen \nis right, but Regeneron has alleged enough to move forward.   \n2.   Bundled d iscounts  \nAmgen next says that the Complaint fails to plaus ibly allege anticompetitive conduct under \na bundling theory.  \u201cBundling is the practice of offering, for a single price, two or more goods or \nservices that could be sold separately.  A bundled discount occurs when a firm sells a bundle of \n \n7 Amgen\u2019s emphasis  at oral argument  on International  Constr uction Products  LLC v. \nCaterpillar Inc., No. 15- 108-RGA, 2016 WL 264909 (D. Del. Jan. 21, 2016) is similarly \nunavailing.  In that case, Judge Andrews dismissed an exclusive dealing claim in part on substantial \nforeclosure grounds because there the Plaintiff \u201c allege[d] no  facts about the nature of the exclusive \ndealing arrangements and their potentially anticompetitive  effects . . . .\u201d  Id. at *6.  As explained \nabove, that is not the case here.  14 \n goods or services  for a lower price than the seller charges for the goods or services purchased \nindividually.\u201d  Cascade Health Sols. v. PeaceHealth , 515 F.3d 883, 894 (9th  Cir. 2008).   \nIn LePage\u2019s Inc. v. 3M , the Third Circuit held that  offering  bundled discounts could \nconstitute anticompetitive conduct, even when the goods are sold above cost.  324 F.3d 141, 154\u2013\n57.  Under LePage\u2019s , an antitrust plaintiff must show that the effect of the discounts is to \u201cforeclose \nportions of the market to a pot ential competitor who does not manufacture an equally diverse group \nof products and who therefore cannot make a comparable offer.\u201d  Id. at 155. \nAlthough t he Third Circuit\u2019s assessment of bundled discounts in LePage \u2019s has not been \nwidely adopted, other courts have adopted a stricter formulation that says that  offering bundled \ndiscounts can constitute anticompetitive conduct when allocation of the entire discou nt to the \nsingle product at issue in the case results in below -cost pricing.  See, e.g. , Cascade , 515 F.3d at  \n903 (allocating the entire bundled rebate to the single product at issue to test the impact of a multi-product  bundle).   \nHere, Regeneron alleges facts that appear to meet  even the stricter assessment of bundled \ndiscounts used by courts outside the Third Circuit .  In particular, the Complaint plausibly alleges \nthat, when  Amgen\u2019s approximate ly $90 million annual bundled rebate to ESI Commercial is \nattributed only to sales of Repatha  (which has monopoly power) , it results in Repatha being priced \nbelow cost.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 90\u201393.)   It further alleges that Regeneron does not manufacture Otezla \n(which allegedly has monopoly power) or Enbrel (which allegedly has market power) , or \ncomparable products , and that Regeneron cannot make a comparable rebate offer.\n8  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 18, \n155.)  \n \n8 Regeneron alleges  that it markets only three  drugs in addition to Pral uent and that all three  \nare \u201coverwhelmingly not dispensed as prescription drug [sic] via pharmacies and , thus , are not \nsubject to significant coverage or reimbursement by Third Party- Payors.\u201d   (D.I. 1 \u00b6 18.)  15 \n Amgen contends  that Regeneron\u2019s bundling theory isn\u2019t plausible because  Amgen does not \ncondition Otezla rebates on Repatha coverage.  As explained above , however, Regeneron pleads \na different version of the facts , and I must accept its version as true at this stage.   \nAmgen next argues that Regeneron\u2019s  bundling allegations are deficient  because it has not \nspecifically alleged that there is a dangerous probability of it exiting the market or that exit from \nthe market has occurred or is imminent .  I don\u2019t think that those specific allegations are required \nat the pleading stage, and Amgen has not cited a case saying otherwise.  To the extent Regeneron \nneeds to plead something about it exiting the market (so that Amgen can recoup its discounts ), I \nfind sufficient at this stage Regene ron\u2019s allegations that it will no longer make a profit on Praluent \nstarting in 2022 and that Amgen\u2019s actions are \u201cpushing Praluent\u00ae below a critical mass of market share necessary to compete .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 137\u201338.)  \nFinally , Amgen says that, even if Praluent exited the market, Amgen  would not be able to \nrecoup its discounts because another product,  Novartis\u2019s  Leqvio\u00ae, would put \u201ccompetitive \npressure\u201d on Repatha.  (D.I. 18 at 20.)   Regeneron\u2019s Complaint, however, plausibly alleges that \nLeqvio is not in the same relevant market as Praluent and Repatha  (because Leqvio  is not dispensed \nthrough pharmacies and is not covered by PBM formularies ) (D.I. 1  \u00b6\u00b6 104\u2013 108), and I must accept \nthat as true at this stage.    \nHere again, Amgen\u2019s arguments about bundled discounts implicate factual disputes  that \ncannot be resolved at this stage of the case.  For all of the reasons set forth above, Amgen\u2019s request \nto dismiss Regeneron\u2019s federal antitrust claims should be denied.  16 \n C.  Regeneron\u2019s state law claims should n ot be dismissed.  \nCounts Seven through Eleven allege violations of state law.  Amgen says that the state law \nclaims should also be dismissed.  The parties  give the state law claims only cursory treatment; \neach brief devotes only a single paragraph to all fi ve claims.  I  too will consider  them only briefly.   \nEssentially, Amgen says that Regeneron\u2019s antitrust claim under California\u2019s Unfair \nCompetition Law, California Business and Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 1700, et seq.  (Count Seven), its \npredatory pricing claim under the Unfair Practices Act, California Business and Professions Code \n\u00a7\u00a7 17043, et seq.  (Count Eight), its claim under the Cartwright Act, California Business and \nProfessions Code \u00a7\u00a7 16700 (Count Nine), and its claim under the Donnelly Act, \u00a7 340 of New York\u2019s General Business Law (Count Ten), should be dismissed for the same reasons that the \nfederal antitrust claims should be dismissed.  I recommend denying Amgen\u2019s request to dismiss the federal antitrust claims, so I likewise recommend denying its reques t to dismiss those state law \nclaims.\n9  While I have reservations  about the basis for Regeneron\u2019s claim for tortious interference \nwith prospective business relations (Count Eleven), Amgen argues only that  it should be dismissed \nbecause there is no antitrust violation, and Regeneron has pleaded that there is.  Regeneron\u2019s state \nlaw claims ma y all move forward.  \n  \n \n9 I reject Amgen\u2019s contention that the Complaint fail s to alleg e sufficient details about the \nprice and costs of Repatha.  17 \n IV. ORDER ON THE MOTION TO STAY \nAmgen also moves to stay this case pending further proceedings by the Supreme Court in \nthe parties\u2019 patent dispute .  Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi , 143 S. Ct. 399 (2022) (granting petition for writ \nof certiorari ).  After considering the totality of the circumstances, including the stay factors, I am \nunpersuaded that the Court should exercise its discretion to stay the case  at this time .   \nI agree with Amgen that the stage of th is case does not weigh against a stay.   No discovery \nhas been conducted and the trial date has not been set .   \nHowever, I am skeptical about the potential for the  Supreme Court\u2019s decision to simplify \nthe issues in this case .  There is no simplification  if the Supreme Court affirms the Federal Circuit\u2019s \nholding that Amgen\u2019s patents  are invalid for lack of enablement .  And the parties dispute whether \nthere will be any  simplification if the Supreme Court vacates or reverses the Federal Circuit\u2019s \ndecision.  A mgen a rgues that , if its patents are  ultimately held to be valid  (by the Supreme Court \nor by a lower court on remand) , then Regeneron \u2019s antitrust claims will necessarily fail b ecause \nRegeneron  should never have had the ability to legally sell  its competing product in the  PCSK9 \ninhibitor market .  Amgen alternatively  contends that an ultimate  holding of validity would, at a \nminimum, result in  Regeneron having to pay Amgen a substantial royalty rate, which  could prevent \nRegeneron from being able to compete profitably in the market and render i t unable to prove its \nantitrust claims .  Amgen also points out that Regeneron may de cide not to litigate this case if \nAmgen  wins at the Supreme Court.   \nFor its part, Regeneron points out that the Supreme Court might not decide the ultimate \nissue of validity and may instead remand for further proceedings, and that a final judgment in the patent case could be years away. Regeneron  also disputes that an eventual holding of patent 18 \n validity will moot the antitrust case or that an order requiring it to pay a reasonable royalty will \nprevent it from proving its antitrust claims .   \nIt seems to me that, w hile it is possible that a  Supreme Court  ruling for Amgen  will moot \nor simplify this case , there is  more than a  reasonab le likelihood that a ruling for Amgen will \nactually complicate the case even more than it already is .  Of course, t he possibility that the case \nwill become even more complicated  is not a good reason to plow ahead  blindly with discovery.  \nThere is much to be said for Amgen\u2019s suggestion that we should at least wait until the Supreme \nCourt rules and then see how the parties\u2019 positions  start to shake out .  But I am persuaded that  the \npotential for simplification  by staying the case pending t he Supreme Court\u2019s  ruling is outweighed \nby the  prejudice to Regeneron .  This is a competitor case  involving pharmaceutical products .  \nRegeneron alleges that it is being driven out of the  market  as a result of Amgen\u2019 s conduct .  The \npotential prejudice to Regeneron by delaying the ultimate resolution of this case  is significant.10 \nUnder the circumstances, having carefully considered all of the parties\u2019 arguments and the \nrelevant factors, I will exercise my discretion as follows.  Amgen\u2019s motion to stay is denied wit hout \nprejudice to renew after the Supreme Court issues its ruling in a few months , which will likely be \n \n10 The cases cited by Amgen in support of a stay are distinguishable.  For example, Amgen \ncites a  number of cases in which courts stayed  antitrust claims that alleged  sham patent litigation.  \nSee, e.g., Apotex , 921 F. Supp. 2d at  314\u201316.  The argument for a stay is much stronger in that type \nof case, since the success of the antitrust claim necessarily hinges on the merits of the patent case \nand the antitrust plaintiff is often not subject to a n alleged  restraint separate from  the patent \nlitigation  itself .  That is not the situation here .  The Hatch -Waxman cases are further \ndistinguishable because the operation of the statute usually prevents the generic drug alleged to \ninfringe from entering the market until after the patent litigation is resolved.  There is no additional prejudice to the generic by staying the antitrust case because it is unable to enter the market until it wins the patent dispute.  Here, in contrast, Regeneron is subject to prejudice if resolution of this case is delayed . \nAmgen also cites a number of cases in which courts stayed infringement actions  pending \nreexamination proceedings, which is also not the situation here.  See, e.g., Vehicle IP, LLC v. Wal -\nMart Stores, Inc., No. 10 -503, 2010 WL 4823393, at *1\u20133 (D. Del. Nov. 22, 2010). \n 19 \n long before the parties complete  fact discovery or begin expert discovery.  The Court can \nreevaluate the situation at that time.  Any renewed request for a stay should comply with my \ndiscovery dispute procedures.    V. CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, I recommend that Defendant \u2019s Motion to Dismiss  (D.I. \n17) be DENIED .  Defendant\u2019s Motion to Stay (D.I. 27) is  DENIED.  \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.
