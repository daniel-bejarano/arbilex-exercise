(\"Torrent\"). (D.I. 37 (motion to dismiss Hetero's counterclaims), \nD.I. 40 (motion to dismiss Torrent's counterclaims)). I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. \n38, 55, 60, 63 (briefing for Plaintiff's motion to dismiss Hetero's counterclaims), D.I. 41, 54, 58, \n64 (briefing for Plaintiff's motion to dismiss Torrent's counterclaims)). For the reasons set forth \nbelow, Plaintiffs motions are GRANTED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff received notice that Hetero and Torrent had filed ANDA applications for generic \nversions of Novartis's Entresto product in September 2019. (D.I. 1 at ,r,r39, 73). Subsequently, \nPlaintiff sued Hetero and Torrent (in addition to other co-Defendants) alleging infringement of \nU.S. Patent No. 11,096,918 (the '\"918 patent\") in September 2021. (D.1. 1 at ill). In October \n2021, Hetero and Torrent answered Plaintiffs Complaint, and included counterclaims seeking \ndeclaratory judgment that the '226, '143, '192, and '667 patents are invalid and/or not infringed. \n(D.I. 22, 24). Plaintiff listed those four patents in the Orange Book in connection with Entresto \nbetween March 2021 and October 2021. (D.I. 60-1, Ex. A). Thus, Hetero and Torrent had filed \ntheir ANDA applications before Novartis listed the four patents in the Orange Book. \nHetero and Torrent supplemented their ANDA applications to include statements pursuant \nto 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(viii) (\"Section viii statements\") for the '226, '143, and '192 patents. \nThose statements affirm that their ANDA products will omit from their labeling any methods of \n3 use that infringe those patents. (D.I. 54-1, Ex. 1 (including Torrent's Section viii statement for the \n'226 and '143 patents), D.I. 55-1, Ex. 1 (including Hetero's Section viii statement for the '226 and \n'143 patents), D.I. 58 at 4 (confirming that \"Torrent filed a section viii statement for the '226, \n'14 3, and ' 192 ... patents\"), D .I. 60 at 4 ( confirming that \"Hetero filed a section viii statement for \nthe '226, '143, and '192 ... patents\")). Hetero and Torrent did not certify pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n355G)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) (\"Paragraph IV certification\") that the '226, '143, and '192 patents will not \nbe infringed and/or are invalid. (D.1. 58 at 4, D.I. 60 at 4). \nPlaintiff separately moved to dismiss Hetero's and Torrent's counterclaims pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(l), Rule 12(b)(6), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. The briefing on the two motions is \nsubstantively identical. Thus, for convenience, I will refer to Hetero and Torrent together as \nD~fendant and only cite to Hetero' s briefing. \nAfter the briefing on the motions to dismiss, the Parties stipulated to the dismissal of the \ncounterclaims against the '667 patent. (D.I. 75, 76). Thus, only the counterclaims as to the '226, \n'143, and '192 patents remain. \n: II. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Rule 12(b )(1) \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )( 1) permits the dismissal of a claim or an action for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. A Rule 12(b)(l) motion may be treated as either a facial or \nfactual challenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d \n333,346 (3d Cir. 2016). A facial attack contests the sufficiency of the pleadings, whereas a factual \nattack contests the sufficiency of jurisdictional facts. See Lincoln Ben. Life Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, \n800 F .3 d 99, 105 (3 d Cir. 2015). When considering a facial attack, the court accepts the plaintiffs \nweil-pleaded factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences :from those allegations \n4 in the plaintiffs favor. See In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data Breach Litig., 846 F.3d 625, \n633' (3d Cir. 2017). The party asserting subject matter jurisdiction bears \"the burden of proof that \njurisdiction does in fact exist.\" Mortenson v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass 'n, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d \nCrr. 1997). \nIn declaratory judgment actions, the plaintiff must show that \"a case of actual controversy\" \nexists to establish subject matter jurisdiction sufficient to maintain an action in federal court. 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (a). The Supreme Court has held that a \"case or controversy\" exists when \"the facts \nalleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between the \nparties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance \nof a declaratory judgment.\" Medimmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007). \"The \ndispute must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal \ninterests .... \" Arris Grp., Inc. v. British Telecomm. PLC, 639 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2011) \n(cleaned up). A \"subjective or speculative fear of future harm\" does not suffice. Prasco, LLC v. \nMedicis Pharm. Corp., 537 F.3d 1329, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \nB. Rule 12(b )(6) \nRule 8 requires a complainant to provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) allows the accused \nparty to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to meet this standard. A Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and \nviewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that those \nallegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n544, 558 (2007). \n5 The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, \nconclusions, or a \"formulaic recitation\" of the claim elements. Id at 555 (\"Factual allegations \nmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all \nthe allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\"). Moreover, there must be \nsufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n_ 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when the complaint's factual content \n\"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\" Id (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's \nliability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" \n(cleaned up)). \n\u2022 III. DISCUSSION \nPlaintiff argues that Defendant's declaratory judgment counterclaims against the '226, \n'143, and '192 patents should be dismissed because (1) they are barred by statute, (2) Defendant \nlacks standing to assert these counterclaims, and (3) the Court should exercise its discretion to \ndis,miss them. (See D.I. 55-1). \nThe parties' arguments regarding whether Defendant's counterclaims are barred by statute \nand whether Defendant lacks standing are overlapping. I will address these arguments together. \nPlaintiff argues, \"[Defendant] is barred by statute from asserting declaratory judgment \ncounterclaims against the '226, '143 [and] '192 ... patents because [Defendant] has not served on \nNovartis any Paragraph IV notice letter for [those] patents\" as is required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n355G)(5)(C)(i) of the Hatch Waxman Act and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) of the Patent Act. (D.1. 55-1 \nat 5-7, 5). Specifically, Plaintiff explains that both 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C)(i)(aa)-(bb) and 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) restrict an ANDA applicant from filing a declaratory judgment action for a \n6 patent unless the applicant filed a Paragraph IV certification for that patent and the patent owner \nwas first given 45 days to bring an action for infringement. (D.I. 55-1 at 5-6 (citing Teva Pharms. \nU$A, Inc. v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 482 F.3d 1330, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (explaining that 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C)(i) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) \"work[] in conjunction\"))). \nGiven that \"a Paragraph IV certification is a statutory prerequisite to an ANDA applicant's \nclaim for declaratory judgment relief under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C)(i) and/or 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n27l(e)(5),\" Plaintiff further argues that Defendant lacks standing to assert the counterclaims. (D.I. \n55-1 at 11-13, 12). Plaintiff asserts, \"Because [Defendant] has declined to submit a Paragraph IV \ncertification for the '226, '143, and '192 ... patents, and instead has chosen to submit Section viii \nstatements for those patents, [Defendant] does not have standing to seek declaratory judgment \nunder those statutes for those patents.\" (D.1. 55-1 at 11-13, 12 (citing Benitec Australia, Ltd v. \nNucleonics, Inc., 495 F.3d 1340, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (affirming the dismissal of an ANDA \napplicant's declaratory judgment counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the \nANDA applicant failed to show a \"substantial controversy [between the parties] of sufficient \nimmediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment\") (quoting Medlmmune, \n549 U.S. at 127))). \nIn response, Defendant argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C)(i) is inapplicable to its \ncounterclaims because this statute applies only to patents \"against which paragraph IV \ncertifications have been filed\" and that \"have been submitted for listing in the Orange Book before \nthe date on which the ANDA ... was submitted.\" (D.I. 60 at 5-10, 5). Defendant asserts that 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) \"does not alter\" its analysis of21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C)(i) because\"\u00a7 271(e)(5) \nconfirms the existence of, but does not limit, declaratory judgment jurisdiction.\" (D.I. 60 at 9-10). \n7 Since 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C)(i) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) do not apply, Defendant argues \nthat, instead, \"35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) creates jurisdiction for an ANDA filer's declaratory judgment \naction.\" (D.I. 60 at 7). Defendant suggests that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) \"provides an affirmative \nbasis for [Defendant's] counterclaims\" because \"the Federal Circuit has held that submission of \nan ANDA alone, not submission of a paragraph IV certification, creates justiciable controversy.\" \n(D.I. 60 at 5-6 (citing Vanda Pharms. Inc. v. W-Ward Pharms. Int'! Ltd., 887 F.3d 1117, 1124 \n(Fed. Cir. 2018))). Defendant stresses that, according to the Teva decision, \"jurisdiction is a two\u00ad\nway street\" (D.1. 60 at 6), where \"if [filing an ANDA] creates a justiciable controversy for one \nparty, the same action should create a justiciable declaratory judgment controversy for the \nopposing party.\" Teva, 482 F.3d at 1342. \nDefendant further asserts that its \"section viii statements do not divest the Court of \njurisdiction\" because 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) \"provides [Defendant] the right to sue for declaratory \njudgment\" irrespective of whether a Paragraph IV certification or Section viii statement was filed. \n(DJ. 60 at 14-15). Even so, given that a case of actual controversy must exist for this Court to \nhave subject matter jurisdiction, Defendant emphasizes the uncertainty that the GSK decision, \nGlaxoSmithKlineLLCv. TevaPharms. USA, Inc., 7F.4th 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2021), caused for ANDA \napplicants relying on Section viii-namely, that a generic manufacturer could later be found liable \nfor infringing methods of use that were omitted from their labels under Section viii. (D.I. 60 at 2-\n3, 15-18). Defendant claims, \"Novartis refusing to grant a covenant not to sue ... yet precluding \n[Dyfendant] from seeking certainty [through its declaratory judgment counterclaims] ... confirms \nthat there is a controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant declaratory judgment[.]\" \n(Id. at 3; see also id. at 15-18, 17 (\"But Novartis refuses to grant a covenant not to sue, so, given \nGSK, a present controversy exists.\"), 18 (\"[I]n this post-GSK world, by refusing to grant a covenant \n8 not to sue, yet attempting to avoid pre-launch litigation, Novartis would have its patents hang over \n[Defendant], with Novartis lying in wait for [Defendant] to launch, so Novartis can then potentially \nseek an injunction and damages when it hurts most.\")). \nI agree with Defendant that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C)(i) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) do not \nstatutorily bar the declaratory judgment counterclaims and warrant dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). \nInstead, these statutes are specific to situations where a Paragraph IV certification was filed. See \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C)(i)(aa)-(bb) (stating that \"no action may be brought under section 2201 of \ntitle 28 by an [ANDA applicant] for a declaratory judgment with respect to a patent which is \nsubject of [a Paragraph IV certification] unless [(aa)] the 45-day period referenced to in [21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 355G)(5)(B)(iii)] has expired [and (bb)] neither the owner of such patent nor the [NDA holder] \nbrought a civil action against the applicant for infringement of the patent before the expiration of \nsuch period\"); 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) (\"Where a person has filed an [ANDA] application ... that \nincludes a [Paragraph IV certification], and neither the owner of the patent that is subject of the \ncertification nor the [NDA holder] brought an action for infringement of such patent before the \nexpiration of 45 days after the date on which the notice ... was received, the courts of the United \nStates shall, to the extent consistent with the Constitution, have subject matter jurisdiction in any \naction brought by such person under section 2201 of title 28 for a declaratory judgment that such \npatent is invalid or not infringed.\"). These statutes also do not, however, provide a statutory basis \nfor, or subject matter jurisdiction over, Defendant's counterclaims. See also Teva, 482 F.3d at \n1338 (\"The Declaratory Judgment Act and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) are examples oflegislation that \nexpand standing to constitutional limits and provide a way for plaintiffs to bring actions in federal \ncourt when they might otherwise be barred.\"). \n9 In that vein, I disagree with Defendant that, instead, \"35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) deems \nsubmission of an ANDA a technical act of infringement, thereby creating jurisdiction including \ndeclaratory judgment jurisdiction\" over its counterclaims. (D.I. 60 at 2-3, 2). I find that 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 271(e)(2) does not provide this Court subject matter jurisdiction over Defendant's counterclaims \nand that the Teva decision should not be interpreted to suggest otherwise. \nThirty-five U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) provides this Court with subject matter jurisdiction over \ninfringement claims filed by patent owners. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 27l(e)(2) (\"It shall be an act of \ninfringement to submit (A) an [ANDA] application ... for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of \nwhich is claimed in a patent ... \"). Particularly, for a patent owner, \"the requirements for \njurisdiction in the district courts are met once [the] patent owner alleges that another's filing of an \nANDA infringes its patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) .... \" AstraZeneca Pharms. LP v. Apotex \nCorp., 669 F.3d 1370, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2012). \nIt does not follow, however, that there is subject matter jurisdiction in this case over the \ncounterclaims. Defendant argues that \u00a7 271(e)(2) provides a \"two-way street\" for declaratory \njudgment jurisdiction based on a statement from the Teva decision. (D.I. 60 at 6 ( citing Teva, 482 \nF.3d at 1342 (\"[I]f [submitting an ANDA] creates a justiciable controversy for one party, the same \naction should create a justiciable declaratory judgment controversy for the opposing party.\"))). I \ndisagree with Defendant's interpretation. It ignores the statement's context. The cited language \nfrom Teva is limited to the context of an ANDA applicant that submitted a Paragraph IV \ncertification. See Teva, 482 F.3d at 1342 (citing Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U.S. 661, \n678 (1990) (holding that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271( e )(2) creates \"a highly artificial act of infringement that \nconsists of submitting an ANDA ... containing the fourth type of certification\")), 1345 ( explaining \nthat, when an ANDA applicant certified patents under Paragraph IV, they indefinitely \"remain[] \n10 subject to ... infringement actions ... under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)[,]\" thus substantiating a \"threat \nof protracted litigation [which] creates a present and real harm\")). Indeed, the Teva decision states \nthat whether an ANDA applicant relied on a Paragraph IV certification is \"dispositive\" in \ndetermining whether they have a \"justiciable declaratory judgment controversy.\" Id at 1344 (\"A \njusticiable declaratory judgment controversy arises for an ANDA filer when a patentee lists patents \nin the Orange Book, the ANDA applicant files its ANDA certifying the listed patents under \nparagraph IV, and the patentee brings an action against the submitted ANDA on one or more of \nthe patents. The combination of these three circumstances is dispositive in establishing an actual \ndeclaratory judgment controversy as to all the paragraph IV certified patents .... \"); see also id at \n1335 (considering whether an ANDA filer's declaratory judgment actions brought \"under 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5)\" should be dismissed). \nOn the other hand, for a declaratory judgment action brought by an ANDA applicant under \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5), \"Congress explicitly extended federal court declaratory judgment \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 to ANDA paragraph IV disputes ... and did so 'to the extent \nconsistent with the Constitution.\"' Id at 1336 (quoting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 27l(e)(5)). There is an \"actual \ncontroversy\" in declaratory judgment actions under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) because, once an ANDA \napplicant files a Paragraph IV certification, they \"remain[] under the threat of an infringement suit \n[once] the 45-day statutory window\" passes. Id. at 1341. \nAn ANDA applicant that submits a Section viii statement does not create an \"actual \ncontroversy\" because there is no cause of action. A patent owner's infringement action under 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)-while within the Court's jurisdiction independent of \"the ultimate merits of \nthe claim[]\"-may be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) (as opposed to Rule 12(b)(l)) if the ANDA \napplicant submitted a Section viii statement. See AstraZeneca, 669 F.3d at 1377-80, 1380 \n. 11 (\"Because [ANDA filers] have submitted ANDAs seeking approval to market [a pharmaceutical] \nfor uses that are not subject to [patent owner's] method of use patents, [patent owner] does not \nstate a claim for infringement of these patents under\u00a7 271(e)(2).\"). Indeed,\"[\u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(viii) \nof the Hatch Waxman] Act allows generic manufacturers to limit the scope of regulatory approval \nthey seek-and thereby forego Paragraph IV certification and a\u00a7 271(e)(2) infringement suit-by \nexcluding patented indications from their ANDAs\" using Section viii statements. Id at 1379. \nThus, an ANDA applicant that submits a Section viii statement for a patent does not face the \nimminent threat and actual controversy of an infringement action under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 27l(e)(2) for \nthat patent. \nDefendant asserts that the GSK decision creates an actual controversy for ANDA applicants \nthat rely on Section viii statements because it raises the specter of later being found to infringe \nmethods of use that they carved out. I do not agree. Defendant's concerns amount to no more \nthan \"subjective or speculative fear of future harm\" that cannot justify subject matter jurisdiction. \nPrasco, 537 F.3d at 1335; see also GlaxoSmithKline, 7 F.4th at 1326 (\"This narrow, case-specific \nreview of substantial evidence does not upset the careful balance struck by the Hatch-Waxman \nAct regarding section viii carve-outs.\"). \nIn a recent supplemental filing, \u00b7Defendant provides notice of a \"citizen's petition\" that \nPlaintiff filed with the FDA. (D.I. llO). In its citizen's petition, Plaintiff requests that the FDA \n\"[r]efrain from approving any ANDA ... until the expiration of the ['226, '143, and '192 patents] \nif that ANDA contains a section viii statement to these patents and seeks to omit the patent\u00ad\nprotected use in [these] patents.\" (D.I. 110, Ex. 1 at 5). Plaintiff argues that the carve out to the \nEntresto label required to approve Defendant's ANDA would \"not [be] consistent with FDA \nprecedent.\" (Id, Ex. 1 at 4). Considering Plaintiffs arguments in its citizen's petition, Defendant \n. 12 asserts, \"Novartis's challenge to generic companies' ability to rely on section viii statements with \nrespect to the ['226, '143, and' 192 patents] reinforces the existence of a dispute between Novartis \nand Torrent/Hetero regarding those patents that is appropriate for resolution on declaratory \njudgment.\" (Id at 2). I disagree. Plaintiffs petition to the FDA, which to my knowledge has \nreceived no response, does not affect my analysis of whether this Court has subject matter \njurisdiction over Defendant's declaratory judgment counterclaims. \nFor these reasons, I find that Defendant has not shown that this Court has subject matter \njurisdiction over its declaratory judgment counterclaims against the '226, '143, and '192 patents. \nThus, I will dismiss these counterclaims under Rule 12(b )(1 ).1 \nIn the alternative, if there were subject matter jurisdiction, I would still dismiss the \ncounterclaims. \nPlaintiff argues, \"The Court should exercise its discretion to dismiss [Defendant's] \ndeclaratory judgment counterclaims against the '226, '143, [ and] '192 patents,\" because Defendant \n''jumped the gun and [has] prematurely filed declaratory judgment claims without complying with \nstatutory requirements that provide [Plaintiff] advance notice of [Defendant's] substantive \ncontentions, and the opportunity to sue [Defendant] first.\" (D.I. 55-1 at 7-11, 9 (citing Paddock \nLab 'ys, Inc. v. Ethypharm S.A., 2011 WL 149860, at *4 (D.N.J. Jan. 18, 2011) (declining to \nexercise discretionary jurisdiction over an ANDA applicant's declaratory judgment action because \n\"continuing [the] lawsuit [would be] contrary to the intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act\"))). \nDefendant responds, \"[T]he Court should reject Novartis's attempt to transform its \nstatutory-bar argument into a basis for the Court to exercise its discretion to deny declaratory \njudgment jurisdiction\" because Defendant's counterclaims \"accomplish exactly [the] purpose\" of \nthe. Hatch-Waxman Act-\"facilitat[ing] early resolution of patent disputes.\" (D.I. 60 at 2, 10-14). \n\"As long as the district court acts in accordance with the purposes of the Declaratory \nJudgment Act and the principles of sound judicial administration, it has broad discretion to refuse \nto entertain a declaratory judgment action.\" Commc 'ns Test Design, Inc. v. Contee, LLC, 952 F.3d \n1356, 1361-62 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (cleaned up). For the reasons provided above regarding the \nstatutory requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(5)(C) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(5) for declaratory \njudgment jurisdiction, were this Court to have subject matter jurisdiction, I would exercise my \ndiscretion not to entertain Defendant's declaratory judgment counterclaims. Given that Defendant \ndid not submit Paragraph IV certifications for the '226, '143, and '192 patents, I do not believe \nthat considering Defendant's declaratory judgment counterclaims would be an efficient use of \njudicial resources. Currently, Defendant is not at risk of Novartis filing a viable infringement \naction under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) for those patents.
