{"case_name": "Menzies v.

Charkow, H ARRIS WINICK HARRIS LLP,  Chicago, Illinois.  \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff.  \n Renee Mosley Delcollo, Richard Philip Rollo, Travis Steven Hunter , R\nICHARDS , \nLAYTON & FINGER , PA,  Wilmington, Delaware; H. Nicholas Berberian, Kyle D. \nRettberg, NEAL GERBER EISENBERG , Chicago, Illinois;  Jennifer Marie Kinkus, \nWilliam  Edward Gamgort, Y OUNG , CONAWAY , STARGATT & TAYLOR LLP, Wilming-\nton, Delaware; Peter F. O\u2019Neill, S HOOK HARDY & BACON , Chicago, Illinois.  \n \nCounsel for Defendant s. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nNovember 1 0, 2021  \n \n \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nFraud charges are serious. So anyone alleging fraud must explain specifically  how \neach defendant defrauded him. Steven Menzies has not. He describes a  tax-fraud \nscheme  but does not explain how Christiana Bank  defrauded him . So all of his fraud \nclaims  against the Bank fail.  \nBut he also says Christiana Bank violated its fiduciary duties as his trustee. T hat \nclaim need not be as specific. Because it is plausible, I will not dismiss it.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nMenzies cofounded  an insurance firm and later sold some of his stock.  Second Am. \nCompl., D.I. 165 \u00b6  1. But he wanted to avoid  taxes on the sale , so he hired Northern \nTrust, a tax -planning firm . Northern Trust proposed a complex tax shelter developed \nby Euram Bank. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 16\u201317, 43 . Northern Trust and Euram assured Menzies that \nthe shelter was  legal, as did a tax lawyer  at Seyfarth, Shaw LLP. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 59, 100.  \nThe strateg y involved trusts. Id. \u00b6 43. Menzies needed a trustee who would au-\nthorize the trust  to take part  in prearranged transactions. Northern Trust nominated  \nChristiana Bank, which had experience with similar schemes . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 50\u201351. \nMenzies agreed . But he  never communicated with Christiana  directly . D.I. 26 7, at \n8; D.I. 269, at 4. Instead, Euram Bank sent Christiana documents to sign, plus a list \nof transactions  to perform . Second Am. Compl.  \u00b6\u00b6 65, 69, 78, 82. Christiana complied. \nId. \u00b6 75. Yet i t failed t o report a large stock transaction  when it filed tax returns for \nthe trust. Id.  \u00b6 136. And it did not tell Menzies when it consulted a lawyer about those \ntax returns. Id.  \u00b6 94. 3 The IRS eventually discovered the shelter and audited Menzies\u2019s tax returns. Id.  \n\u00b6 137. It found that  the shelter was illegal. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 139, 143. Facing stiff penalties, Men-\nzies settled with the IRS for  $10 million. Id. \u00b6 144. \nAggrieved , Menzies sued Seyfarth, Northern Trust, and Christiana . He says they \nconspired to induce him  into a tax -shelter  scheme  that they knew was unlawful. Id.  \n\u00b6 1. \nNow Christiana moves  to dismiss Menzies\u2019s claims against it: fraudulent misrep-\nresentation, civil conspiracy, joint enterprise liability, negligent misrepresentation, \nunjust enrichment , and breach o f fiduciary duty . Christiana says these claims are \ntime -barred, released, and in adequately  plead ed. In support of its motion , Christiana \nattaches  several exhibits , which Menzies urges us to ignore .  \nOn this motion to dismiss , I take all facts in the complaint as true and  can consider \nonly the attached trust certificates . Menzies\u2019s tort and unjust -enrichment claims  \nwere in adequately  pleaded, but Menzies\u2019s claim for breach of fiduciary duties sur-\nvives . \nII. I CAN CONSIDER ONLY THE ATTACHED TRUSTS  \nChristiana asks me to consider several exhibits:  \n\u2022 Three trust certificates, D.I. 26 7, Ex. A\u2013C; \n\u2022 Three agreements  releasing Christiana from certain claims, id. , Ex. D\u2013F; \nand \n\u2022 IRS letters that might relate  to a statute -of-limitations defense, id. , Ex. G\u2013\nI.  4 At this stage,  I can consider these exhibits only if they are \u201cintegral to or explicitly \nrelied upon\u201d in Menzies\u2019s complaint. In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec.  Litig ., 114 \nF.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997)  (internal quotation marks omitted). Only the trust \ncertificates are.  \n1. IRS letters. Menzies never mentions the IRS letters . Nor are they integral to  \nhis claims. True,  the letters might support Christiana \u2019s defense.  But Christiana\u2019s de-\nfense is not Menzies\u2019 s claim . So I cannot consider the letters now. See Schmidt v. \nSkolas, 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014).  \n2. The  release agreement s. The same goes for the agreement s releasing Christiana \nfrom liability. Those releases are not the basis for Menzies\u2019s claims  but merely \u201c rele-\nvant to a potential affirmative defense.\u201d Mesta v. RBS Citizens N.A. , 2014 WL \n7272270, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 18, 2014). Thus, I may not consider them either.   \n3. The trust certificates. But I can consider the attached trust certificates. Menzies \nsays that Christiana breached its fiduciary duties as trustee. Fiduciary duties are \noften defined by the trust itself. See, e.g. , Del. Code Ann. tit. 1 2, \u00a7 3806(c); Cargill, Inc. \nv. JWH Special Circumstance LLC , 959 A.2d 1096, 1112 \u201313 (Del. Ch. 2008). So the \ncertificates are integral to Menzies\u2019 s breach -of-fiduciary -duty claim.  \nIII. NEBRASKA LAW APPLIES TO MOST OF MENZIES \u2019S CLAIMS  \nNext, the parties dispute which state\u2019s  law applies to Menzies\u2019s claims : Delaware\u2019s \nor Nebraska\u2019s. Though the parties  agreed to Delaware law in their trusts, Nebraska  \nlaw governs Menzies\u2019 s tort and unjust -enrichment  claims . \nThe trusts say  that Delaware law  govern s them . D.I. 26 7, Ex. A, \u00b6  14; Ex. B, \u00b6  5(b); \nEx. C, \u00b6  15. So Delaware law defines the scope of Christiana\u2019s fiduciary duties and 5 controls that claim. See Delaware Statutory Trust Act, Del Code Ann. tit. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 3801 \u2013\n29. \nBut the trusts never say  which  law applies to Menzies\u2019s  related  tort and unjust -\nenrichment claims. See Gloucester Holding Corp. v. U.S. Tape & Sticky Prods. , LLC , \n832 A.2d 116, 123 \u201324 (Del. Ch. 2003). So  I apply Delaware\u2019s conflict -of-law rules. \nKlaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. , 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941).  \nAnd those rules say that  Nebraska law should apply.  Delaware courts generally \napply the law of the state in which a plaintiff received and relied on a misrepresen-\ntation . Pa. Emp. v. Zeneca, Inc. , 710 F. Supp. 2d 458, 472 (D. Del. 2010); Restatement \n(Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7  148, cmt. j.  Here, that is Nebraska , so I apply its law  to \nthe tort and unjust -enrichment claims .  \nIV. MENZIES HAS NOT ADEQUATELY PLED MOST CLAIMS  \nChristiana also says Menzies does not provide enough facts to state his claims. \nOrdinarily, a plaintiff need plead only enough facts to make his claim plausible. Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007). But plaintiffs alleging fraud  must \n\u201cstate [their claims] with particularity.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  The parties disagree \nabout which s tandard applies. So I must resolve that dispute first,  then see whether \nMenzie s has met that standard.  \nA. Menzies\u2019s tort and unjust -enrichment claims  must satisfy  Rule 9(b)  \nRule 9(b)  applies to claims that  \u201csound [ ] in fraud .\u201d Republic Bank & Tr. Co. v. \nBear Stearns & Co., 683 F.3d 239, 247\u2013 48 (6th Cir. 2012) ; see also In re Fruehauf \nTrailer Corp. , 250 B.R. 168, 197 \u201398 & n.26\u2013 32 (D. Del. 2000). To decide which of \nMenzies\u2019s claims do, I look to state law.  6 Fraudulent misrepresenta tion and negligent misrepresentation are inherently \nfraud- based under Nebraska law. See Zawaideh v. Neb. Dep\u2019t of Health & Hum. Servs. \nRegul. & Licensure, 825 N.W.2d 204, 212 \u201313 (Neb. 2013) (fraudulent misrepresenta-\ntion); Farr v. Designer Phosphate & Premi x Int\u2019l, Inc. , 570 N.W.2d 320, 326 (Neb. \n1997) (negligent misrepresentation) . So Rule 9(b) applies to those claims.  \nMenzies\u2019s other claims are not  inherently fraud -based . See Eicher v. Mid Am. Fin. \nInv. Corp. , 748 N.W.2d 1, 15 (Neb. 2008) (conspiracy); Win slow v. Hammer, 527 \nN.W.2d 631, 636 (Neb. 1995) (joint enterprise liability ); Kanne v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. , \n723 N.W.2d 293, 302 (Neb. 2006)  (unjust enrichment) ; Estate of Eller v. Bartron , 31 \nA.3d 895, 897 (Del. 2011) (breach of fiduciary duty). But federal c ourts still apply Rule \n9(b) to these claims if they are based on fraudulent activity. See, e.g.,  Lum v. Bank of \nAm., 361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir. 2004) . \nMenzies\u2019s conspiracy , joint -liability , and unjust -enrichment  claims allege fraud. \nLike a classic fraud cl aim, all allege that the defendants gave Menzies \u201cthe false im-\npression\u201d that the tax shelters were valid and \u201cconvey[ed] false, misleading, or omit-\nted facts\u201d to induce his reliance. Second Am. Compl.  \u00b6\u00b6 230, 232\u2013 33, 240, 265 . But his \nfiduciary duty claim does not. That claim focuses on \u201cthe negligence and carelessness \nof Christiana,\u201d rather than some misrepresentation. Id.  \u00b6 260. So it  is not subject to \nthe Rule 9(b) pleading requirements. See Evans v. First Mt. Vernon, ILA, 786 F. Supp. \n2d 347, 357 (D.D.C. 2011).  7 So I will consider whether Menzies sufficiently ple aded his fraud -based claims \nunder Rule 9(b), then whether he ple aded breach of fiduciary duty under the tradi-\ntional pleading standard.  \nB. Menzies\u2019s fraud -based claims do not satisfy Rule 9(b)  \nI must first de cide whether Menzies has alleged fraud specifically enough . Claims \nsubject to Rule 9(b) must provide \u201cthe \u2018who, what, when, where, and how\u2019 of the events \nat issue.\u201d In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 311 F.3d 198, 217 (3d Cir. 2002)  \n(quoting In re Burlington , 114 F.3d at 1422)) . And claims against multiple defendants \nmust \u201cseparately plead the fraudulent acts of each defendant,\u201d not merely allege that \ndefendants\u2019 broader scheme was fraudulent. MBIA Ins. Corp. v. Royal Indem. Co. , \n221 F.R.D. 419, 421 (D. Del. 2004).  \nMenzies has not met this standard. He does not identify any misleading state-\nments or actions by Christiana \u2014or indeed, any direct interaction with Christiana. \nAnd he does not explain how Christ iana would have known that the tax shelters were \nfraudulent. Cf. Trednnick v. Bone , 647 F. Supp. 2d 495, 501 (W.D. Pa. 2007). All he \nsays is that Christiana administered trusts and entered into transactions that some-\none else designed to be fraudulent . \nThat  is not enough. So I dismiss Menzies\u2019s fraudulent -misrepresentation, negli-\ngent-misrepresentation, conspiracy, joint -enterprise, and unjust -enrichment claims. \nAnd because this is Menzies\u2019s third complaint, I will not let him amend.  \nC. Menzies\u2019s fiduciary -duty claim survives  \nNext , I consider whether Menzies has plausibly alleged that Christiana breached \nits fiduciary duties as trustee. Menzies says Christiana improperly failed to explain 8 the risks of the tax shelter. Second Am. Compl.  \u00b6 259. Plus, it did not tell him that it \nhad consulted a tax lawyer about its duty  to report one of the transactions. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 94, \n259. \nTo plausibly show that Christiana breach ed its fiduciary dut ies by not providing \nhim with tax advice or disclosing lawyer co nsultations , Menzies must show that \nChristiana had those duties in the first place . Estate of Eller, 31 A.3d at  897. Trustees  \nlike Christiana  are subject to traditional fiduciary duties, unless otherwise specified \nby trust itself. Del. Code Ann. tit. 12, \u00a7  3806( l). So to determine Christiana\u2019s duties, I \nlook to the trust and, if silent, to the common law.  \nMenzies claims that Christiana should have explained the risks of tax shelters. \nBut the trusts do not impose a general duty on Christiana to provide tax advice. Nei-\nther does the common law. See, e.g. , Jeffery Rapaport M.D., P.A. v. Robin S. Weingast \n& Assoc\u2019s, Inc. , 859 F. Supp. 2d 706, 718 (D.N.J. 2012). Christiana would have that  \nduty only if it presented itself as a tax expert. Id.  at 718\u2013 19. \nBut the co mplaint never suggests that Christiana discussed taxes with Menzies, \nlet alone that it claimed expertise. On  the contrary, Christiana\u2019s only involvement in \nthe tax shelter was at the direction of true tax experts.  Thus,  Christiana ha d no duty \nto discuss th e risks of this shelter with Menzies.  \nMenzies also says Christiana should have told him that it had consulted with a \nlawyer about whether certain transactions were reportable. Again, the trust does not \nsay whether Christiana had a duty to disclose this information. But the common law \ndoes. Generally, trustees must disclose the content of any legal advice related to trust 9 administration, at least when trust beneficiaries ask for  that advice and trust funds \npaid for it. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank v. Zimmer, 355 A.2d 709, 712 (Del. Ch. 1976). It follows \nthat a trustee must disclose that it consulted a lawyer  so that the beneficiaries can \nask for more information . Second Am. Compl. \u00b6  94 (alleging that trust paid for legal \nadvice); Christoff v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am. , 2018 WL 1327112, at *2 (D. Minn. \nMar. 15, 2018) (citing Wachtel v. Health Net, Inc. , 482 F.3d 225, 231 (3d Cir. 2007)). \nSo Menzies has plausibly pleaded a  claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  \nV. MENZIES \u2019S CLAIMS ARE NOT CLEARLY TIME-BARRED  \nFinally, Christiana says that Menzies\u2019s fiduciary duty claim is untimely. Because \nthat claim is governed by Delaware law, the bar is straightforward. He must bring it \nwithin three years  \u201ceven if [he was] ignoran t of the cause of action.\u201d Wal -Mart Stores, \nInc. v. AIG Life Ins. Co. , 860 A.2d 312, 319 (Del. 2004); Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, \n\u00a7 8106(a).  \nBut there is an exception: if his injury was \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d \u2014that is, \nthere were no \u201cobservable or objective fa ctors\u201d suggesting something was awry \u2014then \nthe limitations period runs from when Menzies should have discovered the wrongful \nact. In re Dean Witter P\u2019ship Litig. , 1998 WL 442456, at *5 (Del. Ch. July 17, 1998); \nWal-Mart , 860 A.2d at 319.  \nHere, the alleged b reach of fiduciary duty occurred well over three years in ad-\nvance. See, e.g. , Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  94, 256. Thus, it is time -barred unless the \ninherently -unknowable -injury exception applies.  \nAnd i t might. Determining when a person should have discovered a wrongful act \nis a fact -intensive inquiry. See Isaacson, Stopler & Co. v. Artisan\u2019s Sav. Bank , 330 10 A.2d 130, 133 \u201334 (Del. 1974). Bu t at this stage, I know only  what Menzies says: th at \nhe began to suspect Christiana\u2019s breach only when he settled with the IRS , less than \nthree years before filing this suit. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 \u00b6 94, 146. Taking this as true, \nMenzies\u2019s  injury was inherently unknowable because information about the alleged \nbreach \u201cis within Christiana\u2019s exclusive control.\u201d Second Am. Compl. \u00b6  94; see \nKrahmer v. Christie\u2019s Inc. , 903 A.2d 773, 782 (Del. Ch. 2006). So I will not dismiss \nthis claim as time -barred. See Wal -Mart , 860 A.2d at 320\u2013 21. \n* * * * * \nMenzies has not pleaded enough facts to suggest that Christiana was part of a \nfraudulent conspiracy. But he has plausibly pleaded that Christiana violated its fi-\nduciary duties to him. I thus let his fiduci ary claim proceed but dismiss his other \nclaims against Christiana with prejudice.  "}
