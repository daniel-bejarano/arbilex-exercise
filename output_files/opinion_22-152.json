Civil Action No. 22-152-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nC.G., by and through her parents, (collectively, Plaintiffs) brought this civil \naction against the Brandywine School District (the District). Plaintiffs allege that \nthe District failed to provide C.G. a free appropriate public education (FAPE) as \nrequired by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA or the Act), 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1482. Plaintiffs further allege discrimination in violation of\u00a7 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, et seq.; and 14 Del. Admin. Code\u00a7 922, et seq. D.I. 1 \nat I. \nThis action follows a decision of a Delaware Department of Education Due \nProcess Panel (the Panel) in favor of the District. Pending before me are cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record. For the reasons that follow, I \nwill grant the District's motion, deny Plaintiffs' cross-motion, and enter judgment \nin the District's favor. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Statutory Framework \nThe IDEA offers states federal funds to assist them in educating disabled \nchildren. Endrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 580 U.S. \n386,390 (2017). To obtain funding under the Act, a state must provide every \ndisabled child in its population with a F APE that includes both \"special education\" \nand \"related services.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401(9), 1412(a)(l). The Act defines \n\"special education\" as \"specially designed instruction ... to meet the unique \nneeds\" of a disabled child; it defines \"related services\" to mean any support \nservices or accommodations \"required to assist\" in that instruction. \u00a7 1401 (29), \n(26); see also Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 390-91. \nThe Act requires the state to develop and provide an \"individualized \neducation program\" (IBP) for each disabled student. \u00a7 1401(9)(D). An IEP is a \nwritten comprehensive education plan that identifies the child's present \nperformance levels and future academic goals and outlines concrete steps to assist \nthe student. \u00a7\u00a7 1412(a)(4), 1414(d). An IBP must be \"reasonably calculated to \nenable ... progress appropriate in light of the [disabled student's] \n2 circumstances.\" Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 403. In other words, the educational \nprogram \"must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive meaningful \neducational benefits in light of the student's intellectual potential and individual \nabilities.\" Ridley Sch. Dist. v. MR., 680 F.3d 260,269 (3d Cir. 2012) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also K.D. ex rel. Dunn v. Downingtown \nArea Sch. Dist., 904 F.3d 248,254 (3d Cir. 2018). \nB. Facts \nC.G. is autistic and therefore eligible for special education and related \nservices under the Act. D.I. 14-2 at 179. She attended school in the District until \nthe end of the 2018-2019 school year, when she left to attend White Clay School, a \nprivate school. D.I. 14-1 at 102. She attended White Clay for one year. D.I. 14-1 \nat 102. In the summer before the 2020-2021 school year, C.G.'s parents emailed \nthe District, stating that they might enroll C.G. in a District school and asking for \nan updated IBP. D.I. 14-1 at 102. The District scheduled a series of psychological, \nspeech/language, and occupational therapy evaluations that began on July 21 and \nended on August 11. D .I. 14-1 at 103. The District's behaviorist also emailed \nWhite Clay, requesting additional information regarding C.G.'s behavioral data. \nD.I. 14-1 at 104. \nC.G.'s IBP meeting took place on September 2. D.I. 14-2 at 179. The \nproposed IBP described the results of C.G.'s evaluations and set seven goals for \n3 C.G. D.I. 14-2 at 179-206. The IEP supported these goals through services such \nas direct instruction and counseling. D.I. 14-2 at 179-206. The first four goals \nrelated to C.G.'s academic performance and the last three targeted her social and \nbehavioral development. \n1. Goals 1 & 2: Math Calculation and Number Sense \nC.G.'s evaluations showed that she needed support in mathematics, as she \nscored in the \"low\" range in five out of six tested categories and \"below average\" \nin the sixth. D.I. 14-2 at 183. The IEP's first two goals were to improve C.G.'s \nperformance in math calculation accuracy from 16% to 60% and to improve her \nsuccess rate in number sense exercises from 0/5 to 3/5. D.I. 14-2 at 192-94. To \nsupport these goals, the IEP called for C.G. to receive direct instruction in math \ncalculation and number sense five times per school week for 25 minutes each \nsession. D.I. 14-2 at 192-94. Direct instruction would take place in her special \neducation classroom. D.I. 14-2 at 192-94. C.G. would also be provided with \npositive reinforcement (per C.G.'s behavior support plan), breaks, and consistent \nand clear routines. D.I. 14-2 at 192-94. \n2. Goals 3 & 4: Reading Fluency and Comprehension-Text\u00ad\nBased Writing \nC.G. scored \"below average\" in reading comprehension and fluency. D.I. 14-\n2 at 183. The IEP set as C.G.'s goal for reading comprehension to improve her \naccuracy in answering inferential questions from 36% to 70%. D.I. 14-2 at 195. \n4 The District proposed a reading-fluency goal of 110 words per minute with 98% \naccuracy. D.I. 14-2 at 195. Under the IEP, C.G. was to receive direct instruction \nin the language arts every school day for 3 0 minutes in her special education \nclassroom. D.I. 14-2 at 195. \n3. Goals 5, 6 & 7: Self-Regulation, Peer Interaction, and \nApplication of Learned Skills \nTo achieve C.G.'s goal of moving from demonstrating age-appropriate social \nskills with adult assistance to demonstrating those skills independently, the IBP \nrequired the District to provide C.G. with direct instruction in peer interaction three \ntimes a day ( five minutes each session) in the general education setting and once \ndaily (15 minutes each session) in the special education setting. D.I. 14-2 at 200-\n01. She would also receive direct instruction in self-regulation (35 minutes a day) \nwith a goal of decreasing the time spent out of her general education classroom. \nD.I. 14-2 at 198-99. In addition to direct instruction in self-regulation, the District \nwould support C.G.'s progress through the use of, among other things, a visual \nschedule, extra time to prepare for transitions, and leadership opportunities. \nD.I. 14-2 at 197-98. Finally, the District set a goal of improving C.G.'s \napplication of learned skills from 0/5 to 4/5 times when prompted, supported by 45 \nminutes of direct instructiqn a day. D.I. 14-2 at 202-03. \n5 4. Additional Support for C.G. \nUnder the IBP, C.G.'s progress toward all seven of these goals would be \nsupported by group and individual counseling for four hours a month in her general \nand special education environments, as well as occupational therapy and \nspeech/language pathology services on a consultative basis. D.I. 14-2 at 204. The \nIEP also included a draft behavior support plan (BSP) that continued the services \nprovided by White Clay-many of which were also incorporated into other \nportions of the IBP-until the District could complete its own data collection and \nobservation of C.G. in her new educational environment. D.I. 14-2 at 211-13. \nThe IEP also took into account that some days C.G. would need more support than \nothers; thus, the amount of time C.G. would spend in her general education \nclassroom was flexible within certain boundaries. The IEP placed C.G. in a \"B\" \nsetting, meaning that C.G. would spend at least 40% and no more than 79% of her \nday in her general education classroom. D.I. 14-2 at 179-206. \nC. Procedural History \nTwo days before the District's September 16, 2020 start date, C.G.'s parents \nreturned the signed IEP to the District with a note stating: \"[We] agree that [C.G.] \nis in need of special education services and agree that she requires services under \nIDEA; however, [we] do not agree that the program offered by the District is \nappropriate and therefore, per [our] Aug. 5, 2020 notice to the District, [C.G.] will \n6 attend White Clay School for the 2020-2021 school year.\" D.I. 14-1 at 106. \nC.G.'s parents then filed a due process complaint with the Delaware Department of \nEducation, alleging that the District denied C.G. a F APE under the IDEA and \nrequesting reimbursement for C.G.'s tuition at White Clay for the 2020-2021 \nschool year. D.I. 14-1 at 100-01. After a three-day hearing, an independent panel \n(the Panel) found that the District provided C.G. with a F APE for the 2020-2021 \nschool year. D.I. 14-1 at 101-12. The Panel therefore denied Plaintiffs' request \nfor tuition reimbursement. D.I. 14-1 at 112. \nII. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review \nI have jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' IDEA,\u00a7 504, and ADA claims pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. I have jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. \nWhen reviewing an appeal from a state administrative decision under the \nIDEA, federal district courts conduct a modified de novo review. S.H v. State\u00ad\nOperated Sch. Dist. of Newark, 336 F.3d 260,270 (3d Cir. 2003). Under this \nstandard, the district court makes its own findings by a preponderance of the \nevidence but also gives \"due weight\" to the findings made in the administrative \nproceeding. Id.; see also D.S. v. Bayonne Bd. of Educ., 602 F.3d 553,564 (3d Cir. \n2010). \"Factual findings from the administrative proceedings are to be considered \nprima facie correct.\" State-Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark, 336 F.3d at 270. And \n7 \"[i]fthe reviewing court does not adhere to those findings, it is obliged to explain \nwhy.\" Id. (citation omitted). \"The party challenging the administrative decision \nbears the burden of persuasion.\" Ridley Sch. Dist., 680 F.3d at 270. \nID. DISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs seek tuition reimbursement for C.G.'s fifth-grade year at the White \nClay School under the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, and Delaware \nlaw. Based on the record, the District offered C.G. a F APE and Plaintiffs' claim \nunder each of these laws fails. \nA. The IDEA and Delaware Law Implementing the IDEA \nUnder the IDEA, parents have a right to tuition reimbursement for a \nunilateral placement of a student at a private school only if \"the student's IEP is \ninappropriate.\" HL. v. Downingtown Area Sch. Dist., 624 Fed. App'x 64, 68 (3d \nCir. 2015). \"[T]he party seeking relief must show that the public school failed to \n'offer an IBP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate \nin light of the child's circumstances.\"' C.F. v. Radnor Twp. Sch. Dist., 2019 WL \n1227710, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 14, 2019) (quoting Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 399). \n\"F APE 'consists of educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique \nneeds of the handicapped child, supported by such services as are necessary to \npermit the student to benefit from the instruction.\"' MA. v. Jersey City Bd. of Ed., \n592 Fed. App'x 124, 128-29 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Ridley, 680 F.3d at 268-69). \n8 \"Any review of an IEP must appreciate that the question is whether the IEP is \nreasonable, not whether the court regards it as ideal.\" Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 399. \nIf a student was denied a F APE, the court next considers whether the private \nschool placement was appropriate. Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dept. of Educ. of \nMassachusetts, 471 U.S. 359, 370-71 (1985); Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Carter, \n510 U.S. 7, 14 (1993). \n1. The District Provided C.G. with a FAPE \nPlaintiffs argue that C.G.'s IBP was deficient because it (1) was not \nsupported by a comprehensive evaluation of all suspected areas of her social, \nemotional, and behavioral needs; (2) did not contain measurable and ambitious \ngoals; (3) did not state the amount of special education instruction C.G. would \nreceive; (4) did not provide sufficient special education instruction in math; and (5) \ndid not contain a finalized BSP. D.I. 15-2 at 13. Plaintiffs argue that because of \nthese deficiencies, the District never offered C.G. a PAPE. See D.I. 15-2 at 1, 7, \n12, 17. \na. Comprehensive Evaluation \nThe record shows, and Plaintiffs do not dispute, that the District subjected \nC.G. to several days of psychoeducational and occupational therapy evaluations. \nD.I. 14-1 at 103. These evaluations examined C.G.'s academic, social, emotional, \nand behavioral needs. See D .I. 14-1 at 179-85. The results appear in the first ten \n9 pages of C.G.'s IEP and the District relied on those results to design for C.G. seven \ngoals. D.I. 14-2 at 182-91. The IBP supported these goals through (1) services \ndesigned to help C.G. improve in her weaker areas and (2) accommodations (e.g., \nproviding breaks and allowing additional time for transitions) to address C.G. 's \nunique behavioral challenges. D .I. 14-2 at 182-91. Plaintiffs do not argue that \nC.G.'s evaluations deviated from the District's typical procedure when a family \nrequests an updated IEP over the summer, nor do they explain why the evaluations \nwere deficient. And based on the District's IBP-created using the information it \ngathered about C.G.'s unique needs-I see no basis to find that the District's \nevaluation of C.G. was deficient. \nb. Measurable and Ambitious Goals \nAs stated above, the District's evaluations enabled it to set goals for C.G. to \naddress her weaknesses in mathematics, reading comprehension and fluency, peer \ninteractions, self-regulation, and application of learned skills. The goals were all \nmeasurable. C.G.'s goal for math calculation, for instance, targeted improvement \nfrom 16% to 60% accuracy. The other six goals were likewise quantifiable. And \nwhile Plaintiffs argue that the goals for mathematics did not target mastery level \n(i.e., 90% correct before moving on to new material) and were less ambitious than \nthe goals that C.G. worked towards at White Clay, the standard for a PAPE is to \n10 enable the student to make meaningful progress in light of her circumstances. That \nstandard is satisfied here. \nc. Amount of Special Education Instruction \nThough the IBP did not give an exact amount of special education \ninstruction for C.G. to receive, it did give a range: C.G. would spend between 40% \nand 79% of her time inside her regular classroom and the balance of her time in a \nspecial education setting. At the same time, within that intentionally flexible \nframework, the IEP provided some certainty by stating where the District would \nprovide C.G.'s services (e.g., daily direct instruction in math calculation in her \nspecial education classroom). I therefore find that the IEP was sufficiently detailed \nregarding the amount of special education the District would provide for C.G. and \nthat Plaintiffs could make an informed decision about C.G.'s placement. \nd. Special Education Instruction in Math \nThe IEP included 25 minutes of direct instruction in math calculation and \nnumber sense each school day. Under the plan, C.G. would receive this instruction \nin her special education classroom and receive the balance of her mathematics \ninstruction in her general education classroom. The District would also support her \nprogress in math through two other goals: self-regulation (35 minutes a day) and \napplication of learned skills ( 45 minutes a day). Through self-regulation, the \nDistrict would provide accommodations such as noise-reducing headphones to help \n11 C.G. remain in a learning state, and C.G. would learn calming strategies to help her \nhandle her frustrations associated with math. Application of learned skills would \nhelp C.G. use the tools the District provided through direct instruction in other \nareas to help her achieve her goals. This instruction, balanced with the IEP's goal \nof allowing C.G. to spend time in the general education setting and have \nopportunities to interact with her neurotypical peers, was not a denial of F APE. \ne. Behavior Support Plan \nPlaintiffs do not challenge the sufficiency of the BSP, only that it was a draft \n(i.e., that the school would update the BSP after observing C.G.'s behavior for a \nfew weeks). Although it is true that the IEP included a draft BSP, \"draft\" is \nsomething of a misnomer here. This was not some generic BSP; it was based on \nthe plan that White Clay developed for C.G. over several months at the start of the \n2019-2020 school year. D.I. 14-1 at 203-04; D.I. 15-2 at 20 (Plaintiffs stating that \nthe draft BSP was a \"restatement of White Clay's behavior plan from the previous \nschool year\"). It was in place just a few months before C.G. would have started at \nthe District's school. D.I. 14-1 at 203-04 And Plaintiffs do not point to any \ndeficiency in the BSP as it applied to C.G. at White Clay. The District planned to \nuse the existing BSP for the first few weeks of the school year while collecting \ndata to update C.G.'s BSP. D.I. 14-1 at 203-04. So while the BSP was technically \na draft, it was designed to meet C.G.'s unique needs. \n12 The District's plan to update the BSP after observing C.G. in her new \nlearning environment (whether that environment was in person or virtual) was \nlikewise not a denial ofF APE. Testimony from the District's behaviorist, Lauryn \nElder, shows that IEPs are not set in stone but are meant to be adapted over time by \nthe IBP Team to meet the needs of the child. See D.I. 14-1 at 219. Elder also \ntestified about the importance of gathering behavioral data when a student changed \neducational environments. She stated that even if White Clay had provided \ndetailed information about C.G.'s behavior in addition to the BSP, she would have \nevaluated C.G. 's behavior \"within [the District's] school[], whether that was \nvirtual or in person.\" D.I. 14-1 at 216. Eider's testimony emphasized the need to \nobserve C.G. in her environment, or \"meet her where she's at in an educational \nsetting,\" and hold an IBP meeting to \"adjust the plan for C.G. in that setting\" if \nnecessary. D.I. 14-1 at 216. Notably, White Clay took a similar approach when \nC.G. started school there; it provided C.G. an initial BSP on October 4, 2019 and \naltered it on November 4, 2019. D.I. 14-1 at 110. Accordingly, I find that \nincluding a draft BSP did not constitute denial of a F APE. 1 \n1 Plaintiffs contend that the District should have collected behavioral data on \nC.G. during the summer (as it would have had to because C.G.'s parents requested \nan IBP toward the end of June). C.G.'s parents did not inform the District that she \nwas in summer school, but they argue that the District could have sent \"a one \nsentence email\" to discover that fact. D.I. 18 at 1. The District's failure to ask \nwhether C.G. was in summer school does not alter the analysis here. The draft \n13 f. The District Offered C.G. a FAPE \nBased on my review of the record, I find that C.G. 's IEP consisted of goals \nand services reasonably calculated to enable C.G. to make progress appropriate in \nlight of her circumstances. The IEP addressed her weaknesses in math and English \nby offering direct instruction in the special education classroom. It provided \nsupport for her in the general education classroom as well, including instruction on \nappropriate peer engagement. It taught her strategies to keep her in a learning state \nthrough self-regulation, and it gave her support and encouragement in applying the \nskills that she learned to achieve her goals. All these services were supported by \nindividual and group counseling. Accordingly, I find that the District offered C.G. \na F APE, and I need not consider whether White Clay was an appropriate \nplacement. \n2. The IEP Was Timely \nPlaintiffs next argue that the IEP was untimely because the District offered it \nto C.G. after she had started the school year at White Clay. D.I. 15-2 at 7. \nPlaintiffs base their untimeliness argument on two provisions of the IDEA: \n\u00a7 1414(d)(2)(A) and\u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). D.I. 15-2 at 10-11. \nSection 1414(d)(2)(A) provides: \nBSP was designed to meet C.G.'s unique needs and to help her make reasonable \nprogress in school. \n14 At the beginning of each school year, each local \neducational agency, State educational agency, or other \nState agency, as the case may be, shall have in effect, for \neach child with a disability in the agency's jurisdiction, \nan individualized education program, as defined in \nparagraph {l)(A). \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(2)(A). Plaintiffs argue, without citing any case law, that \"[a]t \nthe beginning of each school year\" refers to the beginning of the school year for \nthe private school of the parents' choice. But by its express terms,\u00a7 1414(d)(2)(A) \napplies only to local educational agencies, state educational agencies, and other \nstate agencies. And the IDEA defines \"local educational agency\" as a \"public \nboard of education or other public authority\" that administers or serves public \nschools, \u00a7 1401 ( 19), and \"State educational agency\" as the agency primarily \nresponsible for state supervision of public schools,\u00a7 1401(32). Section \n1414( d)(2)(A) requires these agencies ( and \"other State agenc[ies ]\") to \"have in \neffect\" by \"the beginning of each school year\" an IEP \"for each child with a \ndisability in the agency's jurisdiction.\" Thus, it is clear that the school year \nreferred to in the statute is the school year for the schools in the particular agency's \njurisdiction-Le., public schools, not private schools of a parent's choice. \nSection 1412(a)(l 0)(C)(ii) states: \nIf the parents of a child with a disability, who previously \nreceived special education and related services under the \nauthority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private \nelementary school or secondary school without the \nconsent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a \n15 hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the \nparents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or \nhearing officer fmds that the agency had not made a free \nappropriate public education available to the child in a \ntimely manner prior to that enrollment. \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (emphasis added). Seizing on the last clause, \nPlaintiffs argue that\u00a7 1412(a)(l0)(C)(ii) required the District to have provided \nthem an IEP for C.G. \"prior to [her] enrollment\" in White Clay. D.I. 15-2 at 11. \nBut this provision has no application here because, as the italicized portions of the \nquoted language make clear,\u00a7 1412(a)(l0)(C)(ii) addresses the situation where \nparents remove their child from a public school and place the child in a private \nschool. See also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) (\"The cost of reimbursement \ndescribed in[\u00a7 1412(a)(l0)(C)](ii) may be reduced or denied if at the most recent \nIEP meeting that the parents attended prior to removal of the child from the public \nschool, the parents did not inform the IEP Team that they were rejecting the \nplacement proposed by the public agency to provide a free appropriate public \neducation to their child .... \" (emphasis added)). \nAccordingly, I find that the District's IEP for C.G. was not untimely. \n3. The Panel's Decision Was Not Based on Inadmissible \n\"Fluid\" Testimony \nPlaintiffs next fault the Panel for \"relying upon the District's testimony at \nthe hearing that [C.G.'s] placement was fluid.\" D.I. 15-2 at 16; see also D.I. 15-2 \nat 5. According to Plaintiffs, \"[a]t the hearing, the District testified that [C.G. 's] \n16 placement was 'fluid,' meaning her time in the special education classroom could \nincrease or decrease depending on the level of support [C.G.] or her providers felt \nshe needed during a given day and, critically, without the Parents' consent or even \nknowledge.\" D.I. 15-2 at 5. Plaintiffs, however, do not identify and I am unable to \nfind anywhere in the Panel's decision where the Panel used the word \"fluid\" or \nsuggested that it relied on testimony to the effect that C. G. 's \"time in the special \neducation classroom could increase or decrease depending on the level of support \n[C.G.] or her providers felt she needed during a given day and, critically, without \nthe Parents' consent or even knowledge.\" Moreover, the Panel stated in its \n\"Findings of Fact\" section of the decision that the IBP placed C.G. in \"a 'B' \nsetting, with [C.G.] served inside the regular classroom greater than or equal to \n40% of the day and no more than 79% of the day.\" D.I. 14-1 at 105. That finding \nof fact is supported by the written IEP, which states that \"Services [ will be] \nProvided Both in Separate Special Education Classes and Regular Setting\" and that \nthe \"Student [ will be] served inside the regular classroom greater than or equal to \n40% of the day and no more than 79% of the day.\" D.I. 14-2 at 206. And the \nPanel stated in its decision that \"[t]o the extent that the testimony of various \nwitnesses is not in accord with the findings as stated herein, it is not credited.\" D.I. \n14-1 at 101 .. Accordingly, there is no evidence to suggest that the Panel relied on \nthe alleged \"fluid\" testimony Plaintiffs say was inadmissible. \n17 4. Plaintiffs Are Not Entitled to Tuition Reimbursement \nBecause, as discussed above, Plaintiffs have not pointed to record evidence \nthat undermines the Panel's decision or establishes that the IBP was inappropriate, \nthey are not entitled to tuition reimbursement under the IDEA. Downingtown Area \nSch. Dist., 624 Fed. App'x at 68. \n5. Plaintiffs Have Waived Their Claims Under Delaware Law \nPlaintiffs state in their opening briefs introduction that the District \"fail[ ed] \nto provide [C.G.] with the [FAPE] to which she is entitled under ... 14 Del. \nAdmin. C. \u00a7 922, et seq.\" D.I. 15-2 at 1. Yet nowhere in their opening brief do \nPlaintiffs articulate the legal standard for a claim under this portion of the \nDelaware Administrative Code, nor do they raise arguments in support of that \nclaim. Plaintiffs have therefore waived their claim under 14 Delaware \nAdministrative Code\u00a7 922, et seq. See Laborers' Int'/ Union of N. Am., AFL-CJO \nv. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp., 26 F.3d 375,398 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"An issue is \nwaived unless a party raises it in its opening brief, and for those purposes a passing \nreference to an issue will not suffice to bring that issue before this court.\" (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). \nB. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nSection 504 mandates that no disabled person \"shall, solely by reason of her \nor his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under any program that receives federal funds.\" \n18 D.K. v. Abington Sch. Dist., 696 F.3d 233,253 n.8 (3d Cir. 2012) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). In the context of special education,\u00a7 504 \"requires \nschools that receive federal financial assistance to provide a free appropriate public \neducation to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's \njurisdiction.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(a). \nSection 504 states that \"[i]mplementation of an [IEP] developed in accordance \nwith the [IDEA] is one means of meeting the standard established\" for an \nappropriate education. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2); see also D.K., 696 F.3d at 253 \nn.8 (\"[O]ur finding that the School District did not deny D.K. a F APE is equally \ndispositive of Plaintiffs' \u00a7 504 claim.\"). \nHere, Plaintiffs base their\u00a7 504 claim on a theory identical to their IDEA \nclaim: namely, that the District failed to provide C.G. a non-deficient FAPE. D.I. \n15-2 at 1. Plaintiffs do not allege that the District discriminated against C.G. other \nthan by denying her a FAPE. See D.I. 1; D.I. 15-2 at 1. And, for the reasons \ndiscussed above, I find that the District provided C.G. with an IEP developed in \naccordance with the IDEA and therefore provided her with a F APE. Accordingly, \nthe District has met the standard for an appropriate education under\u00a7 504 and \nPlaintiffs' \u00a7 504 claim fails. \n19 C. The Americans with Disabilities Act \nThe ADA \"extends the nondiscrimination rule of[\u00a7 504] to services \nprovided by any public entity ( without regard to whether the entity is a recipient of \nfederal funds).\" Jeremy H by Hunter v. Mount Lebanon Sch. Dist., 95 F.3d 272, \n279 (3d Cir. 1996). Under the ADA, \"no qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied \nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be \nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12132. Though \ndenial of a F APE is not the only basis for an ADA claim by a disabled student, \n\"[ t]ailure to provide a F APE ... generally violates the ADA ... because it \ndeprives disabled students of a benefit that non-disabled students receive simply by \nattending school in the normal course-a free, appropriate public education.\" CG \nv. Pennsylvania Dep 't of Educ., 734 F.3d 229,235 (3d Cir. 2013). \nLike their \u00a7 504 claim, Plaintiffs' ADA claim is based solely on their \nassertion that the District failed to provide C.G. a non-deficient F APE. See D.I. \n15-2 at 1. Plaintiffs do not allege that the District discriminated against C.G. other \nthan by denying her a FAPE. See D.I. 1. For the reasons previously explained, I \nfind that the District did provide C.G. with a FAPE. Thus, Plaintiffs' ADA claim \nfails. \n20 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, I will grant the District's motion for \njudgment on the administrative record and deny Plaintiffs ' cross-motion. \nThe Court will issue an Order and a Judgment consistent with this \nMemorandum. \nDated: J\u00b7 Z /.},. :l \n21 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nC.G., by and through her Parents, \nJim G. and Beth G. of Wilmington, \nDelaware, \nPlaintiffs, Civil Action No. 22-152-CFC \nV. \nBRANDYWINE SCHOOL \nDISTRICT, \nDefendant. \nORDER \nNOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington this Twenty-first day of March in 2023, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Motion for Judgment on the \nAdministrative Record (D.I. 15) is DENIED and Defendant's Motion for \nJudgment on the Administrative Record (D.I. 16) is GRANTED. \nJUDGE "}
