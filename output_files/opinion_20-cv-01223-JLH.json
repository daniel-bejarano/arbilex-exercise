No. 20- 1223- JLH \n    \n \n \nMEMORANDUM O RDER \nPlaintiff Andrew James McCracken appeals from a n unfavorable  decision of the \nCommissioner of  the Social  Security  Administration1 denying his application for Supplemental \nSecurity Income ( \u201cSSI\u201d) benefits.  This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursua nt to  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).  The parties have consented to entry of final judgment by the United States \nMagistrate Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).  (D.I. 16.)  \nThe parties filed cross -motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 17, 19.)  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench at the conclusion of the oral argument on October 29, 2021, the Court \ngrants  Plaintiff\u2019s motion and denies  Defendant\u2019s motion.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissioner \u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence. \u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidence  \u201cmeans \u2014and means only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d   Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kij akazi \nwas automatically substituted for former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul when she \nsucceeded him on July 9, 2021.  2 \n 1154 (2019)  (quoting Consol . Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)) .  In reviewing \nwhether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts  may not \u201c re-weigh the \nevidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d   Chandler v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d \n356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011) ; see al so Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014) .  In other \nwords, r eviewing courts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner \u2019s decision, even if they would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner follows a five -step sequential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third Circuit has previously explained this \nsequential analysis , and the shifting burdens that attend each step, in detail: \nThe first two steps involve threshold determinations.  In step \none, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.  If a claimant is found to be engaging in substantial gainful activi ty, the disability \nclaim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.  If the claimant does not have a severe \nimpairment or combination of impairments, the disability claim is denied.  In step three, the Commissioner compares the medical evidence of the claimant \u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.  If the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim \nis granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether the claimant retains the res idual functional capacity to perform his \npast relevant work.  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final step.  At this stage, the burden of production shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order  to \ndeny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, a nd residual 3 \n functional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of \nall the claimant\u2019 s impairments in determining whether he is capable \nof performing work and is not disabled.  \nNewell v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 545 \u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is identical whether an application seeks  disability insurance benefits  or supplemental \nsecurity income.  McCrea v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nThe decision of the Court was announced from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing \nas follows:  \nPlaintiff \u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted  and the \nCommissioner \u2019s cross- motion for summary judgment is denied . \n Plaintiff argues that the ALJ erred at step four by failing to  \nformulate Plaintiff \u2019s RFC to adequately account for limitations \ncaused by Plaintiff \u2019s severe migraines.  I agree that the case should \nbe remanded for further consideration of the limiting effects of Plaintiff \u2019s migraine headaches and whether his headaches , in \ncombination with his other impairments, require including \nlimitations in the RFC for absenteeism or time off -task. \n The ALJ found that Plaintiff  has a medically determinable \nimpairment of migraine headaches that could reasonably be expected to cause t he symptoms he alleged.  However, the ALJ \nfound that Plaintiff \u2019s testimony concerning the intensity, \npersistence, and limiting effects of his symptoms were not consistent \nwith the medical evidence of record.\n2   \n The record reflects that Plaintiff began complaining of \nmigraine symptoms at least as early as September 27, 2016.\n3  An \nMRI on October 25, 2016 showed foci of increased signal in \nPlaintiff \u2019s brain, which is consistent with migraines.4  Plaintiff \nattended at least 44 medical appointments b etween July 18, 2011 \nand November 3, 2017, where Dr. Gregory Adams, his treating \n \n2 See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929. \n3 (Transcript of Social Security Proceedings, D.I. 12 \u201314 ( \u201cRecord \u201d or \u201cR.\u201d), at 622.)   \n4 (R. at 534.)   4 \n physician, and other treating doctors did not report observations of \ndebilitating migraines.   Many of those appointments do not appear \nprincipally related to Plaintiff \u2019s heada ches, so it\u2019s not clear from the \nrecord whether the doctors performed any assessments for migraine signs or symptoms at each of those appointments.  However, Plaintiff did report migraine symptoms at several of the later appointments.  Several doctors suggested that Plaintiff \u2019s overuse of \nmedications could be causing rebound headaches that contribute d to \nthe severity of Plaintiff \u2019s migraines.\n5   \n On May 25, 2017, Dr. Adams examined Plaintiff and opined \nthat Plaintiff suffered from severe migraines.\n6  Dr. Adams \u2019s opinion \nwas that, although Plaintiff was able to perform household activities, he was unable to hold gainful employment.  After several visits between May 2018 and September 2019, on September 3, 2019, Dr. Barnett -Smith, Plaintiff \u2019s primary care pr ovider, opined that he \nwould need frequent breaks and multiple absences from work \nbecause of her observation of his \u201c severe migraines and chronic \npain.\u201d\n7  On April 2, 2019, Susan Stewart, NP, a treating specialist, \nfilled out an assessment of Plaintiff \u2019s condition where she opined \nthat Plaintiff was sensitive to light and noise and would need \nunscheduled breaks about every three to four  hours and would miss \nabout one day of work per week.8     \n Two consulting physicians in December 2017 and April \n2018 noted that there wa s \u201cno objective evidence to corroborate \nclaimant \u2019s statements \u201d about the severity of his migraine \nsymptoms.\n9  One of the consulting physicians suggested that \nPlaintiff  \u201cappear[ed] capable of a medium RFC  with environmental \nlimitations. \u201d10   \n  \nPlaintiff continued to seek treatment from various physicians \nand specialists and take prescribed medications, including several different trials.  At the hearing before the ALJ in this case, Plaintiff \n \n5 (R. at 534\u201336, 801, 806\u201307, 971.)  \n6 (R. at 841\u201342.)   \n7 (R. at 847, 1214.)   \n8 (R. at 999\u20131004.)  \n9 (R. at 92, 108\u201310, 128\u201330, 149.)   \n10 (R. at 92.)  5 \n testified  that he had 12 to 14 migraines per month for hours or days \nat a time.11  Plaintiff described his migraines as so debilitating he \nhas to l ie down alone in the dark until they pass .   \n \nAfter determining that Plaintiff had medically determinable \nmigraines that could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged pain symptoms, the ALJ  considered both the objective evidence and \nother evidence in the record to determine the i ntensity, persistence, \nand effect of Plaintiff \u2019s pain.\n12  The ALJ concluded that Plaintiff \u2019s \ntreating doctors were not persuasive because they may have relied extensively on self -reported symptoms and that Plaintiff \u2019s migraines \nwere much less debilitating than he described.\n13  From this \nconclusion, the ALJ  formulated an RFC  that limited Plaintiff \u2019s \nexposure to light, sound, and hazards to accommodate his migraines but otherwise ruled, essentially, that he should be able to work through his pain.\n14   \n  \nAs an  initial matter, I find no error in the ALJ \u2019s \ndetermination that NP Stewart\u2019 s opinion was of limited persuasive \npower because it appear ed to substantially rely on P laintiff \u2019s self -\nreported symptoms rather than objective medical findings .15 \n That said, it is undisputed that P laintiff does suffer from \nmigraines.  The ALJ stated that she took Plaintiff \u2019s migraines into \naccount in formulating the RFC, which limited Plaintiff \u2019s exposure  \nto lights no brighter than a typical office lighting  level an d noise no \nlouder than a typical office level.  But there is no substantial evidence to support a finding that the particular noise and light restrictions adopted by the ALJ would prevent Plaintiff from having multiple migraine headaches per month or would alleviate his \n \n11 (R. at 19\u201320, 60\u201361.)   \n12 R. at 20\u201326; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(c).   \n13 (R. at 20\u201326.)   \n14 (R. at 19, 24\u201325.)  \n15 (R. at 23\u201324.)  Under current regulations, t he ALJ need not give the treating specialist \ncontrolling weight but instead must  consider several factor s including how relevant the supporting \nobjective medical evidence is to the medical opinion and how consistent the medical opinion is with evidence from other medical sources.  20 C.F.R. 416.920c(c).   6 \n symptoms such that he could perform light work when he does have \nthem.16 \n As for the frequency and intensity of Plaintiff \u2019s migraines, \nthe ALJ discounted Plaintiff \u2019s testimony that he suffered multiple \ndebilitating migraines per month becaus e the records of doctors \u2019 \nvisits suggested that he showed up for his appointments and was not obviously impaired at the visits.\n17  But Plaintiff is not alleging that \nhe is debilitated all the time.18  The fact that he is not debilitated all \nof the time is not substantial evidence that he is not debilitated some of the time.  Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that patients suffering from frequent intermittent migraines are unlikely to attend doctor \u2019s appointments between migraines.  \n  The Commissioner argues that there is no evidence \n[Plaintiff]  rescheduled or cancelled appointments.\n19  But the ALJ \ndid not point to the absence of evidence of appointment cancellations to support her decision.  Moreover, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  On this record, it is unclear to me that there is substantial evidence to enable a finding that Plaintiff \u2019s appointment attendance meant that he didn\u2019 t suffer from \ndebilitating migraines some of the time.   The ability to sporadically attend appointments does not necessarily suggest the ability to work \nwithout absence or interruption. \n The ALJ appeared to suggest that Plaintiff \u2019s migraines \nwould be reduced in frequency or so mild he could work through them if he reduced his use of fast -acting medication.\n20  However, I \nagree with Plaintiff that there is not substantial evidence in this \nrecord to support that conclusion.21    \n \n16 See Overcash v. Saul , No. 19- 737, 2020 WL 1083787, at *14 (D. Del. Mar. 6, 2020) , \nadopted, 2020 WL 3893032 (D. Del. July 10, 2020) ( remanding where \u201ct he ALJ fail [ed] to explain \nthe nexus, if any, between environmental limitations and migraine headaches\u201d).  \n17 (R. at 23\u201326.)  \n18 (R. at 60\u201361.)   \n19 (D.I. 20 at 14.)   \n20 (R. at 23\u201324.)   \n21 The Commissioner acknowledges that Plaintiff\u2019s doctors never \u201cprescribed\u201d that he \nshould stop taking Tramadol, or other immediate -acting medications, within the meaning of 20 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.930.  (Tr. 25:13\u201323.)   7 \n When the findings unsupported by substantial evidence are \ndisregarded, what remains is Plaintiff \u2019s history of repeat edly \nseeking treatment and receiving medications for his headaches, the \nopinions of Plaintiff \u2019s physicians that his migraines were so severe \nhe could not work, and Plaintiff \u2019s own testimony about his \ndebilitating migraines.  While the ALJ is free to reject a claimant \u2019s \nsubjective complaints of pain based on inconsistencies in the evidence, there is not substantial evidence of an inconsistency here.\n22 \n In sum, the determination that the RFC need not include \nlimitations for time off task or absenteeism is not supported by \nsubstantial evidence articulated by the ALJ. The Commissioner \u2019s \ndecision is vacated,  and the matter is remanded back to the \nCommissioner in accordance with [the fourth sentence of] 42 U .S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g) for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  On \nremand, the Commissioner should give further consideration to the evidence that Plaintiff is unable to perform light work when he is suffering from a migraine and explain the weight given to such evidence.   \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nPlaintiff \u2019s motion for summary judgment  (D.I. 1 7) is GRANTED  and Defendant\u2019 s motion \nfor summary judgment (D.I. 1 9) is DENIED . \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment in favor of Plai ntiff, remand the action in \naccordance wit h sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and CLOSE the case. \n \nDated: December 2 7, 2021   ______________________________ \n      The Honorable Jennifer L.
