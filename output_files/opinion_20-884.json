Connolly", "date": "02-10-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nROBERT CHARLES LEWIS,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ. No. 20-884-CFC\nELKTON NURSING AND :\nREHABILITATION CENTER,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this jor day of February, 2023, having considered\nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss (D.I. 21);\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss (D.I. 21) is\nDENIED for the following reasons:\n\ni. Plaintiff Robert Charles Lewis proceeds pro se and has been granted\nleave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I.4) On December 21, 2020, the Court\nscreened the Complaint, identified what appeared to be cognizable and non-\nfrivolous claims within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), and entered a\nservice order. (D.I.5) The case was dismissed when Plaintiff failed to timely\n\nreturn documents necessary for service, but was subsequently reopened. (D.I. 7,\n15) On May 23, 2022, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).  (D.I. 21).\n\n2. The legal standard used when screening cases for failure to state a\nclaim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal\nstandard. See Vaughn v. Markey, 813 F. App\u2019x 832, 833 (3d Cir. 2020) (per\ncuriam) (citing Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir. 2000)). Nothing\nhas changed since the Complaint was screened. In addition, the Court must\nliberally construe the Complaint. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).\nIn doing so, the Court concludes that the allegations and claims of fraud contained\n\nin the Complaint are sufficient to withstand the instant motion to dismiss and,\n\nva Judge,\n\ntherefore, denies the motion.\n\n"}
