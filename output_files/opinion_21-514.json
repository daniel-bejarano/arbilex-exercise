(\u201cConexio\u201d); Coras Wellness and Behavioral Health,\nLLC (\u201cCoras\u201d); and Imperium, Inc. (\u201cImperium;\u201d collectively, \u201cRespondents\u201d) to shift costs\nincurred in responding to third-party subpoenas (D.I. 61), plaintiff United States of America\u2019s\n(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) response thereto (D.I. 62), and the Declaration of Mark A. Kasten filed in further\nsupport of Respondents\u2019 motion (D.I. 63), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Respondents\u2019\nmotion is GRANTED-IN-PART for the reasons set forth below.\n\n1. Background. Plaintiff filed this case on April 9, 2021 against a number of\ndefendants, including Connections Community Support Programs, Inc. (\u201cConnections\u201d), for\nalleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d). (D.I. 1) Less than two weeks\nlater, Connections filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. (Bankr. Case No. 21-10723-MFW,\nBankr. D. Del.). In a May 2021 stipulation among Plaintiff, Connections, and other defendants,\n\nthe parties acknowledged Connections\u2019 intention to sell its assets in bankruptcy and agreed that\nConnections \u201cshall take all reasonable efforts to ensure that any and all records or documents\nthat are transferred to a purchaser in any sale of [Connections\u2019] assets will be maintained by such\npurchaser as custodian for [Connections], and to ensure that such purchaser not destroy, alter, or\nremove, or permit the destruction, alteration or removal of, such records and documents, except\nupon motion and order, after reasonable notice to the United States, of the Bankruptcy Court.\u201d\n(DI. 13 at 1,94)\n\n2. Respondents are non-profit organizations in Delaware (Conexio and Coras) and\nPennsylvania (Imperium) that provide management support services in the field of behavioral\nhealth and substance abuse treatment. (D.I. 61 at 1) In July of 2021, Respondents purchased the\nassets of Delaware\u2019s largest provider of substance abuse treatment, Connections Community\nSupport Programs, Inc., in bankruptcy. (Jd.)\n\n3. In January of 2022, Plaintiff served third-party subpoenas on Respondents,\nseeking the production of fourteen categories of Connections\u2019 documents pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 45(a)(1)(D). (D.I. 46-1) Since February of 2022, Respondents represent that they have\nincurred expenses amounting to $52,529.94 for responding to twelve of the fourteen categories\nof requested documents. (D.I. 61 at 1)\n\n4. Respondents\u2019 production in response to two of the subpoenaed categories remains\noutstanding. These categories request documents concerning Connections\u2019 compliance with the\nrecord-keeping requirements of the CSA and communications with the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration. (D.I. 46-1 at 6-7)\n\n5. Respondents have no objection to compliance with the subpoena\u2019s production\nrequirement, but they ask that the costs associated with the production be shifted to Plaintiff as\n\nthe requesting party. Accordingly, Respondents seek reimbursement of the $52,529.94 incurred\nto date, as well as anticipated expenses necessary to respond to two remaining document\nrequests, at an estimated cost between $16,862 and $23,493. (D.I. 63, Ex. A at 9] 4-6) Plaintiff\nhas refused to bear the expenses of the document production. The majority of the expenses are\nnecessitated by the costs of engaging a third-party vendor to redact confidential patient\ninformation from more than 10,000 emails responsive to the subpoena. (D_I. 61 at 2)\n\n6. Legal standard. Rule 45(d)(2)(B)(ii) \u201cprotect[s] a person who is neither a party\nnor a party\u2019s officer from significant expense resulting from compliance\u201d with a subpoena. Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 45(d)(2)(B)(ii). In the Third Circuit, the test for determining whether the expense for\ncomplying with a subpoena is \u201csignificant\u201d is as follows: (1) whether the nonparty has an actual\ninterest in the outcome of the case; (2) whether the nonparty can more readily bear the costs than\nthe requesting party; and (3) whether the litigation is of public importance. See Gould v. O\u2019Neal,\n2019 WL 4686991, at *5 (D.N.J. Sept. 26, 2019). \u201cCost-shifting is particularly appropriate in\nthe context of subpoenas, since Rule 45 directs courts to minimize the burden on non-parties.\u201d\nContant v. Bank of Am. Corp., 2020 WL 3260958, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2020) (internal\nquotations omitted); see also Linder v. Calero-Portocarrero, 251 F.3d 178, 182 (D.C. Cir. 2001)\n(explaining that a \u201ccourt must protect the nonparty by requiring the party seeking discovery to\nbear at least enough of the expense to render the remainder \u2018nonsignificant.\u201d\u201d).\n\n7. Analysis. Applying the three foregoing factors to the circumstances of this case,\nthe court finds that the anticipated future costs of compliance for the remaining two document\nrequests should be shifted to Plaintiff. First, Respondents purchased Connections\u2019 assets in\nbankruptcy free and clear of all liabilities, they are not successors in interest to Connections, and\nthey retained no former employees of Connections. (D.I. 61 at 3) Thus, Respondents cannot be\n\nsaid to have a stake in the outcome of this litigation. See Gould, 2019 WL 4686991, at *5\n(suggesting that a non-party to a case has a reduced level of interest in the outcome of the\nlitigation).\n\n8. Second, Plaintiff has greater resources available to absorb the costs of the\nproduction than Respondents, which are non-profit entities operating on thin margins. See In re\nWesco Distrib., Inc., 2013 WL 432932, at *3 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 4, 2013) (finding \u201cthe Government\ncan more readily bear the burden of the costs associated with complying with the subpoena.\u201d).\nRespondents have already borne significant expense in responding to twelve of the fourteen\ndocument requests, and the balance of this expense should therefore be shifted to Plaintiff.\n\n9. Third, the removal of Connections from the market following Plaintiff's extensive\ninvestigation and enforcement of the CSA satisfied the public\u2019s primary interest in the litigation.\nPlaintiff's only remaining claims are those against the individual former executives of\nConnections. (D.I. 61 at 3) Respondents argue the likely recovery on these remaining claims is\nnot proportional to the expenses Respondents will incur in responding to the remaining two\ncategories of the subpoena. (/d.) Plaintiff counters that the enforcement of public safety laws\noutweighs the dollar value of any recovery. (D.I. 62 at 3) The court acknowledges that the\nlitigation is of public importance and finds that the public interest has been served by\nRespondents\u2019 compliance and absorption of the expenses of document production for twelve of\nthe fourteen categories of records. Thus, having reasonably balanced the cost shifting factors,\nthe court grants Respondents\u2019 motion to shift costs to Plaintiff for the production of documents\nresponsive to the remaining two categories of records.\n\n10. The court denies Respondents\u2019 request for reimbursement of the $52,529.94\nalready incurred in responding to twelve of the fourteen document requests. See Siltronic Corp.\n\nv. Emp\u2019rs Ins. Co. of Wausau, 2014 WL 991822, at *1 (D. Or. Mar. 13, 2014) (\u201c[T]he requesting\nparty is not necessarily required to absorb all of the cost of a non-party\u2019s compliance\u201d with a\nsubpoena). Here, Respondents were aware of their obligations to act as custodians of\nConnections\u2019 records at the time they purchased the assets in the bankruptcy proceeding. (D.I.\n13 at \u00a5 4; D.I. 61 at 1) Accordingly, Respondents should have anticipated incurring some\nexpenses associated with the instant litigation. Moreover, Respondents have provided no\ndocumentation itemizing the expenditures encompassed by the total amount of $52,529.94\nincurred to date. See In re Wesco Distrib., Inc., 2013 WL 432932, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 4, 2013)\n(denying motion to quash subpoena where non-party respondent failed to produce evidence that\nresponding to subpoena would impose undue burden).\n\n11. _ Plaintiff alternatively proposes that Respondents should seek an order pursuant to\n42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.64 authorizing disclosure of patient information to alleviate the cost of document\nreview.' (D.I. 62 at 3) This proposal requires publishing written notifications in general\npublications intended to reach Respondents\u2019 current and former patients, which would likely\nresult in a flood of objections from patients and requests for more information. (/d.; DI. 61 at 4)\nIn this regard, Plaintiff's proposal would undermine the protection of confidential patient\ninformation concerning mental health and substance abuse treatment and would result in\n\nadditional costs to Respondents in the form of responding to patient objections. Plaintiff's\n\n' 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.64 provides that \u201c[a]n order authorizing the disclosure of patient records for\npurposes other than criminal investigation or prosecution may be applied for by any person\nhaving a legally recognized interest in the disclosure which is sought.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.64(a).\nUnder the regulation, \u201c[t]he patient and the person holding the records from whom disclosure is\nsought must be provided: (1) Adequate notice in a manner which does not disclose patient\nidentifying information to other persons; and (2) An opportunity to file a written response to the\napplication, or to appear in person, for the limited purpose of providing evidence on the statutory\nand regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court order[.]\u201d Id. at \u00a7 2.64(b).\n\n5\nsuggestion that the court would bear the burden of holding individual evidentiary hearings to\nresolve patient objections is equally unworkable. (D.I. 62 at 4)\n\n12. Conclusion. Based upon the foregoing, Respondents\u2019 motion for cost-shifting is\nGRANTED-IN-PART. (D.I. 61) Specifically, Respondents\u2019 motion is GRANTED with respect\nto the cost of compliance for the remaining two subpoena categories. Within thirty (30) days of\ncompletion of this remaining production, Respondents shall submit to Plaintiff a declaration with\nan accounting and supporting documentation, such as invoices itemizing vendor expenses and\nattorney time records. Within seven (7) days of service of Respondents\u2019 accounting, Plaintiff\nshall inform Respondents when reimbursement will be sent. Should any further disputes arise\nregarding Respondents\u2019 request for reimbursement for subpoena compliance after Respondents\nprovide Plaintiff with an accounting of actual expenses incurred in responding to the remaining\ntwo subpoena categories, the parties are instructed to follow the court\u2019s standard discovery\ndispute procedures. Respondents\u2019 motion is DENIED with respect to the $52,529.94 incurred in\nresponding to the twelve other subpoena categories.\n\n13. ITIS FURTHER ORDERED that the discovery dispute teleconference scheduled\nfor June 23, 2022 at 2:00 p.m. is CANCELLED.\n\n14. This Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1({a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written\nobjections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Order.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to four (4) pages\n\neach.\n15. The parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under\nFed. R. Civ.
