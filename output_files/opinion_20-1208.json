Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, \nDelaware. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nJanuary 11, 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION /s/ Richard G. Andrews \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge: \nPlaintiff Augustus Hebrew Evans, an inmate at the James T. Vaughn \nCorrectional Center in Smyrna, Delaware , filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \n(D. I. 1 ). Plaintiff appears prose and has paid the filing fee. Plaintiff filed a Second \nAmended Complaint on July 27, 2021, and it is the operative pleading . (D.I. 44). \nPlaintiff seeks injunctive relief. (D.I. 50). The Court proceeds to screen the Second \nAmended Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a).1 \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe Second Amended Complaint reinstates all the operative facts of the \nAmended Complaint. (D.I. 44 at 21 ). Plaintiff alleges violations of the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution . The Court's June 30, 2021 \nMemorandum Opinion discusses in detail the Amended Complaint's allegations which \ndescribes Plaintiffs claims in three stages. (D. I. 40, 41 ). Stage One took place from \nApril 28, 2018 until January 23, 2019, Stage Two took place from January 23, 2019 until \nApril 1, 2020, and Stage Three began on April 1, 2020 when Centurion became the new \nhealth care contract provider for the DOC and continued through November 23, 2020. \n(D.I. 35 at 16, 17, 21, 22). \nAll claims raised in Stage One against Defendants Catherine McKay, Joanne \nBampo, Kimberly Long, Perry Phelps, Dana Metzger, and Stacie Hollis were dismissed \nas time-barred . In addition, I dismissed Anthony Jacobs, William Ngwe, Jessica \n1 Section 1915A(b)(1) is applicable to all prisoner lawsuits regardless of whether the \nlitigant paid the fee all at once or in installments. Stringer v. Bureau of Prisons, Federal \nAgency, 145 F. App'x 751, 752 (3d Cir. 2005). \n1 Johnson, Flora Antangho , Laurie Jones-Mancini, Mary Doyle, and Misty May and all \nclaims against them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) & (ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1 ). \nPlaintiff was allowed to proceed against Matthew Wofford and Christopher Mean. \nWhile the Second Amended Complaint names as Defendants McKay, Wofford, \nMean, Johnson, Sampo, Long, Jacobs, Phelps, and Metzger, it seeks relief from only \nMedical Defendants McKay, Wofford, and Mean and specifically states that it does not \nbring any claims against prior named Department of Correction Defendants . (0.1. 44 at \n1, 3, 6, 35, 36). The Second Amended Complaint amends the Stage One claim and \nadds a Stage Four claim. (Id. at 13, 21-25) Otherwise , the Second Amended \nComplaint is almost identical to the Amended Complaint. (Compare 0.1. 35 at 11-15, \n17-22, 24-29, 31 to 0.1. 44 at 7-9, 11-12, 14-19, 27-32, 34). \nThe Stage Four claims begin on November 24, 2020 and continue through July \n23, 2021. (0.1. 44 at 21, 25). Stage Four refers to Plaintiff's assessment for surgery by \nan outside orthopaedic provider, his March 19, 2021 surgery, and post-operative care \nand medications that Plaintiff did, or did not, receive. (Id. at 21-25). Other than \nreferring to a medical administrator statement that \"we thought you were faking,\" the \nStage Four claims contain no specific claims against Wofford and Moen. (D.I. 44 at 25). \nThe statement is a reiteration of an allegation in Stage Two that Wofford made the \nstatement on July 15, 2019 in response to Plaintiff's inquiries about medical care, a \ntime-frame other than that of the Stage Four claims. (Id. at 17). \nII. SCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious , fails to state a \n2 claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who \nis immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See \nalso 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant) . The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008). Because Plaintiff proceeds prose, his \npleading is liberally construed and his Amended Complaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, \nmust be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless \" or \n\"fantastic or delusional \" factual scenario.\"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions. Tourscher v. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However , before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the Court must \ngrant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or \nfutile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions . \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009 ); Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \n3 plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted. See id. at 11. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane \nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\" Id. \nIll. DISCUSSION \nThe Second Amended Complaint raises claims against McKay, Wofford and \nMean, those being the only Defendants against whom Plaintiff seeks relief. I previously \nfound that Plaintiff adequately raised claims against Wofford and Mean as alleged in the \nStages Two and Three of the Amended Complaint. \nThe Second Amended Complaint somewhat amends the Stage One claims. To \nthe extent Plaintiff seeks to reinstate the Stage One claims, as previously discussed in \nthe June 30, 2021 Memorandum Opinion and Order, all claims are time-barred. (See \n0.1. 40 at 8-10; 0.1. 41). \n4 The Stage Four claim reiterates a claim against Wofford that is raised in Stage \nTwo. Plaintiff has already been allowed to proceed against Wofford on the claims \nraised in Stages Two and Three. \nThe Stage Four claims do not contain specific allegations directed towards \nMcKay. (D.I. 44 at 21-25). \"A[n individual government] defendant in a civil rights action \nmust have personal involvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot be predicated \nsolely on the operation of respondeat superior. Personal involvement can be shown \nthrough allegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and acquiescence . \nAllegations of participation and acquiescence , however, must be made with appropriate \nparticularity. \" Rode v. Dellarciprete , 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988); see Parke/Iv. \nOanberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016). \nThe Second Amended Complaint asks, \"Did Catherine McKay fail to properly \ntrain her employees or are they trained to think a rotator cuff tear is faked!?\" (D.I. 44 at \n25). In the prayer for relief, Plaintiff states (viewing what is written in the light most \nfavorably to Plaintiff) that he wrote to McKay \"after the 3rd MRI was denied,\" and she did \nnot respond. (Id. at 35). The time frame for this communication is rather vague, but it \nappears to have been some time before October 2018. (Id. at 11 ). It may be that any \nclaim based on this fact is time-barred . (See D.I. 40 at 8). Plaintiff concludes that \nMcKay was aware of the delay and inadequate medical care he was receiving, and that \nMcKay established the policies, customs, and practices of her employees in carrying out \nConnections ' interests. (Id. at 35). \nThe only thing that is an alleged fact is that Plaintiff sent McKay a communication \nthat he was getting inadequate treatment and McKay did not respond. This, however, \n5 does not state a claim. Plaintiff does not identify any policy nor is it plausible that there \nis a policy of treating rotator cuff injuries as faked injuries. Plaintiff alleges that medical \nstaff, not McKay, provided him improper treatment which leaves only vicarious liability or \nliability based upon McKay's supervisory status. Those options are not available for a \u00a7 \n1983 claim, and , thus, Plaintiff does not state a claim against McKay. \nAccordingly , the claim against McKay will be dismissed for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted. Plaintiff will be given one final opportunity to amend \nthe claim against McKay. \nPlaintiff will be allowed to proceed against Wofford and Meon. All other \nDefendants will be dismissed. \nIV. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nPlaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction to compel Defendants to provide adequate \npost-operative medical care \"for right shoulder and pre-existing back spasms and \ndebilitating pains.\" (D.I. 50 at 1 ). The motion is directed towards Warden Robert May, \nMedical Administrator Anthony Jacobs, and Nurse Practitioner William Ngwe, none of \nwhom remain as defendants in this action. (Id. at 2). \nTo the extent that Plaintiff seeks to enjoin nonparties to this litigation, \"A non\u00ad\nparty cannot be bound by the terms of an injunction unless the non-party is found to be \nacting 'in active concert or participation ' with the party against whom injunctive relief is \nsought.\" Elliott v. Kiesewetter, 98 F.3d 47, 56 n.5 (3d Cir. 1996). Plaintiff submitted an \naffidavit and medical records to support his motion. (D.I. 51, 52). Upon review, I find \nthere is no factual basis for the issuance of injunctive relief against May, Jacobs, and \n6 Ngwe. Nor has Plaintiff demonstrated irreparable harm or the likelihood of success on \nthe merits. Therefore , I will deny Plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiffs motion for injunctive \nrelief (D.I. 50); and (2) dismiss Defendants McKay, Sampo, Long, Johnson, Jacobs, \nPhelps and Metzger, and all claims against them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1 ); \n(3) give Plaintiff leave to amend the claim against McKay; and (4) allow Plaintiff to \nproceed against Wofford and Mean. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n7 "}
