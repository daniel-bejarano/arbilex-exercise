(D.L. 123; D.I. 124) The Government filed an\nAnswer in Opposition, to which Movant filed a Reply. (D.I. 134; D.I. 135) For the reasons that\nfollow, Movant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 Motion is denied.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts Leading to Movant\u2019s Delaware Charges\n\n[O]n February 5, 2015, [ ]Joseph Turchen, an employee of\na barbershop in the Branmar Plaza shopping center in Wilmington,\nDelaware, observed what he perceived as troubling behavior by\noccupants of a silver Honda Accord in the shopping center parking\nlot. Turchen watched the Accord's two occupants for\napproximately twenty minutes. He testified that the man in the\npassenger seat had a full beard and wore a hoodie, skull cap, and\ndark glasses and that the man in the driver's seat was wearing a\nhoodie and a red or pink scarf over his face the whole twenty\nminutes he was sitting in the car. Turchen found the occupants\u2019\nbehavior suspicious because they were repeatedly looking around\nthe strip of stores in Branmar Plaza, including the barbershop, a\nbank, and a jewelry store, and because he thought one of the\noccupant's movements indicated \u201che was pumping himself up to do\nsomething.\u201d Turchen also testified that the car's occupants were\n\u201cdressed like they was going to go do something.\u201d He could not\nidentify the car's occupants; he could only tell that they were two\nblack males, one with lighter skin. His suspicions resulted in\nanother barbershop employee calling 911 to report the suspicious\nbehavior.\n\nWhen Delaware State Troopers arrived, Turchen saw the\nAccord's occupants look towards the police cars, which were at the\nopposite side of the parking lot. The Accord then promptly left the\nlot. Before the car pulled away, the barbershop's owner, Joseph\nStrano, got into his truck, followed the Accord, and took a picture\nof it and its license plate. He provided that picture to Trooper\nNatalie George, one of the troopers who had responded to the 911\ncall.\n\nTrooper George ran the Accord's license plate number\nthrough a police database and discovered that the car had been\nreported stolen in an armed robbery. She then sent an e-mail to\nother troopers alerting them of that fact and attaching the picture of\nthe Accord, which revealed a distinct bumper sticker on the rear of\nthe car.\n\nTrooper William Yeldell was one of the police officers who\nreceived George's e-mail. He patrolled the area around Branmar\nPlaza on a daily basis and the e-mail prompted him to pay\nparticular attention to Branmar Plaza the following morning,\nFebruary 6, to see if the Accord would return. It did, and he got a\nclear look at its occupants, but only when he passed right in front\nof it, dressed in full uniform in an unmarked police car. At that\npoint, he made direct eye contact with those individuals. He saw\nthat the one in the passenger seat was wearing glasses, a red or\npink scarf, and a white button-up shirt, and that the one in the\ndriver's seat was a black male with facial hair and a black jacket\nover a purple shirt. At trial, Yeldell identified the man in the\npassenger seat as [Movant] and the man in the driver's seat as\nPayton.\n\nAfter passing in front of the Accord, Yeldell communicated\nwith other state troopers over the radio that he would need\nassistance making a vehicle stop. He left the parking lot to meet\nwith the troopers responding to his radio call and to put himself in\na better position to make a safe stop. In doing so, he lost sight of\nthe Accord for less than a minute. When the troopers returned to\nthe parking lot, Yeldell noticed one of the men he had seen was\nnow standing outside of the Accord. The second man was no\nlonger in or near the car.\n\nYeldell knew, with what he described as 100% certainty,\nthat the man outside of the car was the same one he had observed\nin the Accord's passenger seat. He testified that he recognized the\nwhite button-up shirt and the \u201clight red or pink colored scarf.\u201d That\nindividual turned out to be [Movant].\n\nAfter noticing that [Movant] was holding an object in his\nhand, Yeldell pulled out his gun and ordered him to the ground.\n[Movant] ran instead. He passed another trooper, who shot him\nwith a Taser. As he fell to the ground, \u201ca hand gun went flying\nthrough the air.\u201d The troopers attempted to subdue [Movant], and,\nafter a struggle, he was tased a second time. The officers then\nplaced him in handcuffs and recovered a loaded .380 caliber black\nSmith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol.\n\nUnited States v. Foster, 891 F.3d 93, 99-100 (3d Cir. 2018) (cleaned up).\nB. Procedural History in Delaware\n\nOn March 26, 2015, Movant had his initial appearance on a criminal complaint that\ncharged him with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).\nThe Magistrate Judge advised Movant, pursuant to the sentencing provisions of \u00a7 924(e), that he\nfaced a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of fifteen years up to a maximum of life\nimprisonment. (D.I. 134 at 2)\n\nOn April 28, 2015, Movant was indicted on one count of being a felon in possession of a\nfirearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). (DI. 18 at 1, Count 1) The indictment charged\nMovant as follows:\n\nOn or about February 6, 2015, in the District of Delaware, CORY\nD. FOSTER, the defendant, after having been convicted of a crime\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, in the\nCourt of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,\ndid knowingly possess in and affecting interstate commerce, a\nfirearm, that is, a Smith and Wesson, .380 caliber, semi-automatic\n\npistol, model Bodyguard, serial number ECB9844, which had\npreviously been shipped and transported in interstate commerce.\n\nAll in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 922(g)()\nand 924(a)(2).\n\n(DI. 18 at 1) The Government filed an Information Sheet paraphrasing \u00a7 924(e) and stating that\nthe maximum penalty for the offense charged in the indictment was life imprisonment, with a\nminimum mandatory term of fifteen years. (D.I. 18-2)\n\nAt Movant\u2019s arraignment on May 6, 2015, the Magistrate Judge advised Movant that the\nmaximum penalty \u201cis a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 15 years up to a maximum\n\nof life imprisonment and notwithstanding any other provision of the law, the court shall not\n\nsuspend the sentence or grant a probationary sentence.\u201d (D.I. 134 at 2) On June 5, 2015,\n\nDouglas L. Dolfman entered his appearance as Movant\u2019s counsel and filed a motion to suppress\nthe gun. (D.I. 26; D.I. 27) The Court held an evidentiary hearing on Movant\u2019s motion to\nsuppress and denied the motion. (D.I. 47)\n\nOn April 28, 2016, a federal jury convicted Movant of possession of a firearm by a felon,\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). (D.I. 69) This Court sentenced Movant on August 25,\n2016 to the statutory maximum 120 months of imprisonment! followed by 3 years of supervised\nrelease.\u201d (D.I. 95) The Third Circuit affirmed Movant\u2019s conviction and sentence on May 30,\n2018. See United States y. Foster, 891 F.3d 93, 115 (3d Cir. 2018).\n\nC. Procedural History in Pennsylvania\n\nOn October 8, 2015, Movant was indicted in United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania and charged with \u201cthree counts of Hobbs Act robbery in violation of 18\nUSS.C. \u00a7 1951(a); one count of carjacking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119; and four counts of\n\nusing, carrying, and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in\n\n1As explained later in the Opinion, at the time of sentencing, Movant was not, in fact, subject to\na minimum mandatory fifteen year sentence. See infra at 13-14.\n\n2Since Movant possessed the firearm in connection with the commission of another offense, the\nRevised Presentence Investigation Report, dated August 9, 2016, (\u201cPSR\u201d) (D.I. 85) provided\nmultiple calculations for the offense level. As stated in the Revised PSR, \u201c[t]he first\n[calculation] is singularly based on a possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The\nadditional calculations address the [\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)] cross reference.\u201d (D.L. 85 at \u00a7 20) Under the\nfirst alternative, the PSR assessed a base offense level of 24, as \u201cthe defendant committed the\ninstant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions for a crime of\nviolence...robbery in 2006 and 1011.\u201d (D.I. 85 at \u00a221) Two levels were added for stolen\nfirearm (\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)) and four levels for possessing the firearm to perpetrate a robbery (at\nBranmar Plaza) (\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B)), resulting in a total offense level of 30. (D.I. 85 at {{ 22, 23,\n30) The second calculation, which involves the cross reference, was based on Movant using the\nrelevant handgun \u201cin three robberies and one carjacking in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,\u201d\nand resulted in a total offense level of 33. (D.I. 85 at {J 20, 31-69) This became the final\noffense level, as it \u201cis greater than that determined above.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(A). With a\ncriminal history category of V, the guideline range of imprisonment was 210 to 262 months.\nHowever, since that range exceeded the statutory maximum of 120 months of incarceration, the\nrange became 120 months. (DI. 85 at { 115) The parties had no objections to the PSR. (D.I. 94\nat 4-5)\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1).\u201d United States v. Foster, 734 F. App\u2019x 129, 131 d Cir.\n2018); see also (D.I. 1 in USA v. Foster, 15cr485-MAK-01). Counts One, Three, and Five\ncharged Movant with robbery affecting interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 on\nthe respective dates of November 18, 2014, December 2, 2014, and December 7, 2014. (See\nD.L. 1 in USA v. Foster, 15cr485-MAK-01, at 1-2, 4-5, 7-8) Count Five named as victims an\nemployee of a convenience store and one of its customers. (See id. at 7-8) Count Seven is\nrelated to Count Five and charged a carjacking from that customer, also on December 7, 2014,\nand described his car as a \u201c2002 Honda Accord ... that was recovered from ... [Movant] by law\nenforcement in Wilmington, Delaware, on or about February 5, 2015.\u201d (\u00e9d. at 10) Counts One,\nThree, Five, and Seven each has a related charge of using, carrying and brandishing a firearm\nduring a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), respectively, Counts Two, Four,\nSix, and Eight. (See D.I. 1 in USA v. Foster, 15cr485-MAK-01). Each of the firearm counts\ndescribed the firearm as a \u201cblack Smith and Wesson, Model M&P Bodyguard, .380 caliber semi-\nautomatic pistol, serial number ECB9844.\u201d (id. at 3, 6, 9, 11)\n\nThe same attorney who represented Movant in the criminal proceeding leading to the\ninstant \u00a7 2255 motion also represented Movant in the criminal proceeding in the Eastern District\nof Pennsylvania. (See id. at D.I. 7 and D.I. 30) On May 26, 2016, a federal jury convicted\nMovant. (See id. at D.I. 34) The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nsentenced Movant on April 12, 2017 to a total term of 714 months, consisting of 84 months as to\nCount Two, 300 months as to Count Four, 300 months as to Count Eight, and 30 months as to\nCounts One, Three, Five and Seven, each sentence to run consecutive to each other and to the\n\nsentence imposed in Delaware. Count Six was dismissed on the Government\u2019s motion. (See id.\n\nat D.I. 77) The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed Movant\u2019s Pennsylvania\nconvictions on May 23, 2018. See United States v. Foster, 734 F. App\u2019x at 136.\nIL. DISCUSSION\n\nMovant\u2019s timely filed \u00a7 2255 Motion asserts three ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims with respect to his conviction in this Court: (1) counsel\u2019s failure to object to the PSR\u2019s\n\u201cunsupported claims that the Smith & Wesson 380 was [the] same gun from [the] PA offenses,\u201d\nand counsel\u2019s failure to object to the application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(c) (1) cross reference, which\ncaused the sentencing range of 63 to 78 months to be increased to a range of 210 to 262 months.\n(D.I. 123 at 4, DI. 124 at 9-12); (2) counsel failed to present expert testimony regarding Tasers\n(D.I. 123 at 5; D.I. 124 at 13-15); and (3) counsel initially incorrectly advised Movant that a\nfifteen year mandatory minimum sentence applied to his offense and also failed to inform\nMovant about the option of entering an open plea (D.I. 123 at 6; D.I. 124 at 16).\n\nMovant has properly raised his ineffective assistance of counsel allegations in a \u00a7 2255\nmotion. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500 (2003). As a general rule, ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims are reviewed pursuant to the two-pronged standard established in\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Under the first (\u201cperformance\u201d) prong of the\nStrickland standard, Movant must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with reasonableness being judged under professional\nnorms prevailing at the time counsel rendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the\nsecond (\u201cprejudice\u201d) prong of the Strickland standard, Movant must demonstrate a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent. Id. at 694; United States v. Nahodil, 36 F.3d 323, 326 (3d Cir. 1994). A court can\n\nchoose to address the prejudice prong before the deficient performance prong, and reject an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim solely on the ground that the defendant was not\nprejudiced. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698. Finally, although not insurmountable, the\nStrickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation was professionally reasonable. Id. at 689.\n\nA. Claim One: Counsel Failed to Object to \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) Enhancement\n\nUS.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) provides, in relevant part, for a sentencing enhancement \u201c[i]f the\ndefendant used or possessed any firearm ... cited in the offense of conviction in connection with\nthe commission or attempted commission of another offense[.]\u201d U.S.S8.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c )(1).\nSection 2K2.1(c)(1) was amended in 2014 to limit its application only to instances in which the\ndefendant used the exact same firearm \u201ccited in the offense of conviction\u201d in connection with\nanother offense. U.S.S.G. Supp. to App. C, Amend. 784, Reason for Amendment.\n\nAs previously explained, the Court enhanced Movant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7\n2K2.1(c)(1) after determining that the firearm Movant possessed during his Delaware offense\nwas the same firearm he possessed during his Pennsylvania offenses. See supra at 4n.2. In\nClaim One, Movant contends that defense counsel \u201cwas ineffective for failing to object to [the]\nPSR and [the] Government\u2019s false claims that the Smith and Wesson .380 was used in the\nPennsylvania offenses, [because counsel\u2019s failure to object] activated the 2K2.1(c )(1)\nenhancement.\u201d (D.I. 125 at 2) According to Movant, \u201cpart of the reason [the Third Circuit]\naffirmed [his sentence] was because counsel did not object to the PSR\u2019s assertion [that the gun\nfrom Movant\u2019s Delaware offense was the same gun used during Movant\u2019s Pennsylvania\noffenses].\u201d (D.I. 123 at 4) Movant contends that the Government and PSR investigator failed to\n\ndefinitively establish that the same gun was used during Movant\u2019s Delaware and Pennsylvania\n\noffenses because the Government\u2019s witnesses did not conclusively testify that the gun was the\nsame. (D.I. 124 at 9-10)\n\nAs an initial matter, Movant incorrectly asserts that the Third Circuit based its decision to\naffirm his sentence on defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the Court\u2019s application of \u00a7\n2K2.1(c)(1). While it is true that the Third Circuit referenced defense counsel\u2019s failure to object\nwhen explaining why it was applying a plain error standard of review to Movant\u2019s appellate\nchallenge to his sentence enhancement, the Third Circuit thoroughly reviewed the facts when\ndetermining that at \u201cleast three categories of direct and circumstantial evidence\u201d supported this\nCourt\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the Smith & Wesson recovered in Delaware was the same gun used in\nthe Pennsylvania crimes.\u201d Foster, 891 F.3d at 113-15.\n\nAdditionally, Movant\u2019s argument that counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the\n\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) enhancement fails to satisfy either prong of the Strickland standard. The statutory\nmaximum sentence for Movant\u2019s offense of conviction was 120 months. Consequently, even\nthough the application of \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)\u2019s cross reference to Movant\u2019s case resulted in a\nguidelines range of 210 to 262 months of imprisonment, Movant was sentenced to 120 months.\n(D.I. 87 at \u00a2 114, 115) In an attempt to demonstrate prejudice, Movant argues that his guidelines\nrange would have been 63 to 78 months without the application of \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)\u2019s cross\nreference and, therefore, he would have received a sentence lower than his current 120 months.\nThe record does not support Movant\u2019s assertion. As set forth in the PSR, if Movant were held\naccountable only for his actions in Delaware, and his offense level was calculated solely on the\ncharge of felon in possession of a firearm without the application of \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)\u2019s cross\nreference, his offense level would have been 30 with a corresponding guidelines range of 151 to\n\n188 months. (D.I. 87 at 22) In other words, even without \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)\u2019s enhancement,\nMovant\u2019s sentencing range would have been above the statutory maximum. Given these\ncircumstances, Movant cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have received\na lower sentence but for defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the application of \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1).\nMovant also cannot demonstrate that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the application\nof \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) amounted to deficient performance under Stricklana\u2019s first prong. An attorney\ndoes not provide ineffective assistance by failing to present meritless objections or arguments.\nSee United States v. Sanders, 165 F.3d 248, 253 (3d Cir. 1999) (\u201cThere can be no Sixth\nAmendment deprivation of effective counsel based on an attorney\u2019s failure to raise a meritless\n\nargument.\u201d). On direct appeal, the Third Circuit rejected Movant\u2019s underlying argument that the\n\nGovernment did not meet its burden to introduce reliable evidence sufficient to support the \u00a7\n2K2.1(c)(1) enhancement, explaining:\n\nUnlike the cases [Movant] cites, [Movant] did not object to the\nfactual statements contained in the relevant PSRs, and the record\ncontains sufficient evidence to support the District Court's\ndetermination\u2014by a preponderance of the evidence\u2014that the\ngun recovered during [Movant\u2019s] arrest in Delaware was the\nsame gun used during robberies and a carjacking he\ncommitted in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe PSR stated that the Smith & Wesson .380 caliber semi-\nautomatic pistol gun seized at Branmar Plaza was the same gun as\nthe one Foster used during those earlier crimes. Foster did not |\nobject to that conclusion during his sentencing proceedings but on\nappeal characterizes it as unsupportable. He argues that the PSR in\nthis case relied on the PSR prepared in connection with his Eastern\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania convictions and that that underlying PSR\n\nonly identifies the gun used in Pennsylvania as being consistent\n\nwith, rather than the same as, the one recovered in Delaware.\n\nAlthough [Movant] is correct on that point, the conclusion that\n\nthe Smith & Wesson recovered in Delaware was the same gun\n\nused in the Pennsylvania crimes is supported by at least three\n\ncategories of direct and circumstantial evidence.\n\nFirst, a relatively short time separated the crimes [Movant]\ncommitted in Pennsylvania, which took place in November and\nDecember 2014, from his Delaware arrest in February 2015. It is\nnot unreasonable to conclude that [Movant] used the same gun\nover that time period and kept it in his possession to perpetrate\nfuture crimes. Second, there is surveillance video from each of the\nPennsylvania robberies that allows the conclusion that the gun\nused in those crimes and the gun recovered in Delaware are the\nsame. Third, although the victims of the robberies could not\nidentify with certainty that the gun recovered in Delaware\u2014and\nlater shown to each of them during the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania trial\u2014was the same gun they were confronted with\nwhen robbed, they each agreed that the gun looked similar. Those\nfacts, coupled with [Movant\u2019s] failure to object to the PSR during\nhis sentencing proceedings before the District Court, lead us to\nconclude that the District Court did not plainly err by applying \u00a7\n2K2.1(c)(1) to enhance [Movant\u2019s] sentence.\nFoster, 891 F.3d at 113-15 (emphasis added).\nGiven the Third Circuit\u2019s conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to support the\n\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) enhancement, Movant\u2019s argument that defense counsel was ineffective for failing\nto challenge the enhancement is meritless. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim One.\nB. Claim Two: Counsel Failed To Present Expert Testimony On Tasers\nNext, Movant asserts that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by ignoring his\nrequest to retain an expert witness to rebut and discredit as \u201cscientifically impossible\u201d the police\nofficers\u2019 testimony that they saw \u201ca firearm go flying out of [Movant\u2019s] hand as soon as the\nTaser hit [him].\u201d (D.L. 124 at 13-15) Presumably to demonstrate the feasibility of this \u201cscientific\nimpossibility\u201d defense, Movant cites an internet source explaining that tasers \u201chighjack[] the\nreins of the central nervous system\u201d \u2014 \u201chttp://scienceline.org Peter Sergo Ask-sergo-tasers\u201d \u2014 and\nincludes a quote from an alleged taser victim stating that he could not release a gun he had in his\n\nhand after being tased \u201cdue to [his] muscles contracting.\u201d (D.I. 124 at 18-19) Movant also\n\nalleges that defense counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the \u201cscientific impossibility\u201d defense was due to\n\n10\n\ncounsel\u2019s insufficient investigation and counsel\u2019s belief that an expert was \u201cnot worth the cost.\u201d\n(D.I. 124 at 13-14)\n\nMovant\u2019s argument is unavailing. As a general rule, \u201c[w]itness selection is entrusted to\ncounsel's sound judgment, not to the defendant,\u201d and an attorney's reasonable strategic decision\nconcerning which witnesses to call must be accorded high deference. Manchas v.\nSuperintendent of SCI Huntington, 428 F. App'x 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2011). An ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim based on counsel's alleged failure to investigate a potential witness\ncan only succeed by demonstrating that the witness' testimony would have been favorable and\nmaterial. Mere speculation about a witness\u2019 possible testimony is insufficient to satisfy the\nprejudice prong of Strickland. See United States v. Gray, 878 F.2d 702, 712 (3d Cir.1989);\nZettlemoyer v. Fulcomer, 923 F.2d 284, 298 (3d Cir.1991). In addition, the favorable testimony\nmust have been \u201cforthcoming or available.\u201d Zettlemoyer, 923 F.2d at 298.\n\nHere, although Movant cites to the internet and provides the name of two individuals\nwith some knowledge about and/or experience with Tasers, he does not explicitly assert that\nthese two individuals are experts on the effects of Tasers who would have testified at his trial,\nnor does he describe the specific testimony that they would have given at trial. At most,\nMovant\u2019s vague reference to these two individuals amounts to mere speculation that there is\nsome expert who could offer testimony that would contradict the eyewitness testimony provided\nby the Delaware police officers. Such speculation fails to demonstrate prejudice under\nStrickland. To the extent Movant blames counsel\u2019s failure to retain a Taser expert on expense or\ncounsel\u2019s failure to investigate, his vague unsupported assertions are insufficient to satisfy either\n\nprong of the Strickland standard.\n\n11\nFinally, referring to the inconclusive fingerprint evidence and the lack of DNA evidence\nobtained from the gun, Movant attempts to establish prejudice by arguing that the \u201cmisleading\u201d\npolice testimony was the only direct link between Movant and the gun that was recovered from\nBranmar Plaza. The Court is not persuaded. Despite the lack of DNA evidence and the\ninconclusive fingerprint evidence, the overwhelming evidence against Movant precludes him\nfrom demonstrating a reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different\nbut for defense counsel\u2019s failure to retain an expert witness on Tasers: (1) testimony placing\nMovant at Branmar Plaza in a stolen car and engaging in suspicious activity on the day prior to\nthe day of his arrest; (2) testimony placing Movant at Branmar Plaza on the day of his arrest in\nthe same stolen car; (3) the discovery of a loaded rifle, two rolls of duct tape, and a large bag on\nthe back seat of the stolen car; (4) testimony that Movant\u2019s co-defendant exited the stolen car and\nfled from the area when a state trooper drove by the car; (5) testimony that Movant was seen\nstanding outside of the stolen car with something in his hand, and that he ignored a police order\nto get on the ground and fled a short distance before being tased; and (6) testimony that a gun\ncame out of Movant\u2019s hand and fell to the ground after Movant was tased and while his body\nwas falling to the ground. See Buehl v. Vaughn, 166 F.3d 163, 172 d Cir. 1999) (explaining\nthat a court must consider the strength of the evidence against the accused when deciding if the\n\n\u2018Strickland prejudice prong has been satisfied). Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Two.\n\nC. Claim Three: Counsel Improperly Advised Movant About the Applicable\nSentence and Failed to Inform Movant About an Open Plea\n\nIn Claim Three, Movant contends that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by\nincorrectly informing Movant that he was facing a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years\nand by failing to advise Movant about the possibility of entering an \u201copen plea\u201d of guilt without\n\nagreeing to any particular plea agreement stipulations. Movant asserts that defense counsel\u2019s\n\n12\n\nfailure to inform him about an open plea deprived him of a potential 3-point reduction in his\noffense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. According to Movant, the\nimposition of a \u201c120 month sentence [...] that is significantly different from the 180 months\n\n209\n\n[defense counsel] said was \u2018absolutely mandatory\u2019\u201d creates \u201cmore than a substantial probability\u201d\n\nthat the \u201coutcome would have been different\u201d had defense counsel advised Movant \u201cof the\ncorrect guidelines and the 3-point downward adjustment for \u2018acceptance of responsibility.\u2019\u201d\n(D.1. 124 at 16)\n\nMovant\u2019s argument is unavailing. To the extent defense counsel may have initially\nadvised Movant that he faced a fifteen year mandatory minimum sentence,\u2019 defense counsel\u2019s\nsentencing assessment was presumably based on: (1) the Information Sheet filed by the\nGovernment which stated that Movant faced a mandatory minimum fifteen year sentence under\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) due to his three prior Pennsylvania convictions for \u201ccrimes of violence\u2019 (D.I.\n18-2 at 1; D.L. 134 at 15); and (2) the Magistrate Judges\u2019 statements during Movant\u2019s initial\nappearance and arraignment that Movant faced a fifteen year mandatory minimum term of\nincarceration. (D.I. 134 at 15) However, developing caselaw between Movant\u2019s trial and\nsentencing convinced the Government that Movant\u2019s Pennsylvania burglary conviction was not a\npredicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which meant that, if convicted of\nviolating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), Movant faced a statutory maximum sentence of 120 months\n\nrather than a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. (D.I. 134 at 15 n. 2, citing United\n\n3Since the Government did not request to have defense counsel respond to Movant\u2019s allegations,\nthe Court does not know the actual sentencing assessment counsel provided to Movant. For the\nsake of argument, the Court accepts Movant\u2019s assertion as correct.\n\n\u2018Upon the return of the Indictment, the Government filed a Defendant Information Sheet\nnotifying Movant and the Court that Movant faced a mandatory minimum fifteen year sentence\nbecause each of Movant\u2019s prior three Pennsylvania convictions was a predicate \u201ccrime of\nviolence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). (D.I. 18-2 at 1)\n\n13\n\nStates v. Peppers, 899 F.3d 211, 234-36 (3d Cir. 2018) (holding that burglary in violation of\nPennsylvania law does not qualify under the enumerated offense provisions of ACCA)). When\nviewed in this context, the Court concludes that defense counsel\u2019s initial sentencing assessment\nthat Movant faced a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence did not constitute deficient\nperformance under Strickland\u2019 s first prong. Movant has also failed to demonstrate any prejudice\nresulting from defense counsel\u2019s alleged assessment, because Movant neither accepted nor\ndeclined any plea offer while operating under this initial sentencing assessment, and he was not\nsentenced to a mandatory minimum fifteen years of incarceration.\n\nMovant also cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s failure to\nadvise him about the possibility of entering an open plea. Contrary to his belief, Movant would\nnot have been entitled to a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction as a matter of right simply by entering a plea, and\nhe has not provided any facts to support his assertion that entering an open plea would have\nresulted in a lesser sentence for acceptance of responsibility. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. 3 (\u201cA\ndefendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter\nof right.\u201d). In turn, Movant incorrectly assumes that a 3-level acceptance of responsibility\nreduction in his offense level would have reduced his sentencing range below the statutory\nmaximum 120 months. According to the PSR, Movant\u2019s offense level was 33 with a criminal\nhistory category of V, resulting in a sentencing range of 210 to 260 months. (D.I. 87 at \u00a5 115)\nReducing his offense level by 3 levels to 30 would have produced a sentencing range of 151 to\n188 months, which is still significantly greater than the 120-month (statutory maximum)\nsentence he received.\n\nAdditionally, Movant does not affirmatively assert that he would have entered an open\n\nplea but, rather, merely alleges that he \u201ccould have pled guilty to an open plea.\u201d (DI. 123 at 6)\n\n(emphasis added). Given his continued insistence \u2014 during trial and in this proceeding \u2014 that he\ndid not have a gun in his possession at the time of the Branmar Plaza incident,\u2019 Movant cannot\ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have entered into an open plea had counsel\ninformed him of the option. See United States v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 217 F. App\u2019x 166, 169 (3d\nCir. 2007) (holding that the \u201calleged prejudice that [the petitioner] may have suffered [as a result\nof counsel\u2019s failure to advise him about an open plea]... is far too speculative, because his\ncontention that he would have accepted a guilty plea was \u201cbelied\u201d by the fact that he \u201cmaintained\nhis innocence throughout the [trial] proceedings and therefore was not willing . . . to plead guilty\nto the charges against him.\u201d).\n\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Three.\nIII. MOTION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL\n\nDuring the pendency of this proceeding, Movant filed a letter motion asking the Court to\nappoint counsel. (D.I. 125) In support of his request, Movant asserts a single sentence\nexplanation that he \u201cknow[s his] grounds have merit and [he] really could use the assistance of a\ncompetent lawyer.\u201d (D.I. 125 at 1) Having concluded that the Claims in the instant Motion lack\nmerit, the Court will dismiss as moot Movant\u2019s Motion for the Appointment of Counsel.\nIV. EVIDENTIARY HEARING\n\nA district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion filed pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 if the \u201cmotion and the files and records of the case conclusively show\u201d that\nthe movant is not entitled to relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; see also United States v. Booth, 432 F.3d\nsDuring trial, Movant\u2019s theory of defense was that the police fabricated a \u201ccapricious story\u201d\nabout him possessing the gun at the time of Branmar Plaza incident and that nothing connected\nhim to the gun that was introduced as evidence during the trial. (D.I. 91 at 105-112) The\n\narguments in Claims Two and Three of this proceeding essentially promote the same defense\ntheory that Movant was not in possession of any gun at the time of his arrest.\n\n15\n542, 545-46 (3d Cir. 2005); United States v. McCoy, 410 F.3d 124, 131 (3d Cir. 2005); Rule\n8(a), 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2255. As previously discussed, the record conclusively demonstrates that\nMovant is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255. Therefore, the Court concludes an evidentiary\nhearing is not warranted.\n\nVv. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion must also decide whether to\nissue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011). A certificate of appealability\nis appropriate only if the movant \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a\nconstitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The movant must \u201cdemonstrate that reasonable\njurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or\nwrong.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court is denying Movant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 Motion after determining that his ineffective\nassistance of counsel Claims lack merit. The Court is persuaded that reasonable jurists would\nnot find this assessment debatable. Therefore, the Court will not issue a certificate of\nappealability.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe Court concludes that Movant is not entitled to relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2255. An appropriate Order will issue.\n\n16\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nCORY D. FOSTER,\n\nMovant/Defendant, .\nv. | Chim. Act, No. 15-21-RGA\nCiv.
