Andrews", "date": "04-08-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nKUSHAL KALPAN SHAH,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 21-470-RGA\nCONNECTIONS, CSP, et al., ;\n\nDefendants.\n\nKushal Kalpan Shah, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware.\nPro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nApril 8, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nc\nNDREWS, U.S ede\n\nPlaintiff Kushal Kalpan Shah, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 1). He filed\nan Amended Complaint that clarified the parties\u2019 names. (D.I. 7). The Complaint and\nAmended Complaint form the operative pleading. (D.I. 1, 7). Plaintiff appears pro se\nand has paid the filing fee. The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff raises medical needs claims. (D.I. 1, D.I. 7).\n\nPlaintiff was diagnosed as diabetic in 2018. (D.I. 1 at 711). He was not placed\non a \u201cfinger stick system\u201d and medical staff denied his requests for placement on\ndiabetic meal plan. (/d. at If] 12, 45, 46). During March 2020, Plaintiff began\nexperiencing stomach pain, and he was seen by medical on March 16, 2020. (/d. at ]]\n14). Medical staff erroneously determined the pain was a muscle strain from lifting a\nfood cart. (/d.). The pain continued, and on March 18, 2020 Plaintiff was seen by\nDefendant medical provider William Ngwa who diagnosed plaintiff with a stomach\n\nmuscle strain. (/d. at | 15).\n\n1 Section 1915A(b)(1) is applicable to all prisoner lawsuits regardless of whether the\nlitigant paid the fee all at once or in installments. Stringer v. Bureau of Prisons, Federal\nAgency, 145 F. App\u2019x 751, 752 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\n1\nThe pain continued, lab work was conducted, and Plaintiff was provided with a\nliquid diet. (/d. at {J 16-21). Plaintiff was unable to consume the liquid diet, was dry\nheaving, and admitted to the prison infirmary where Defendant R.N. Collette Fomundam\nexamined Plaintiff and treated him with an insulin IV. (/d. at I] 22-33). Plaintiff was\nseen by Dr. Jordan Cunningham who told Plaintiff that he would be fine in a few days.\n(Id. at ] 29). Plaintiff alleges that medical staff were aware that his blood sugar was\ndangerously high yet allowed him to lie in bed without proper medical attention. (/d. at J]\n48). Plaintiffs condition worsened, he began vomiting blood, and at that point was\ntaken by ambulance to Christiana Care Emergency Room. (/d. at | 33-34, 48-49). He\nwas diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and transferred to the ICU where he remained\nuntil March 26, 2020.2 (/d. at { 35-39). He was discharged from the hospital on March\n27, 2020. (/d. at 7 40).\n\nUpon his return to JTVCC Plaintiff asked Dr. Cunningham why his condition had\nbecome so severe, and Dr. Cunningham had no explanation. (/d. at 741). Plaintiff\nalleges that Dr. Cunningham made a false entry in Plaintiffs medical record that he was\nnot taking his diabetic medication. (/d. at | 42). He alleges that prison medical staff\nperformed blood work and an urinalysis and both were negative, while the same tests\nperformed at Christiana Hospital were to the contrary. (/d. at {J 43-44). Plaintiff alleges\nthat the appropriate medical care was delayed by medical staff which exacerbated his\n\ncondition and led to a potentially critical situation. (/d. at {] 50).\n\n2 The Complaint does not provide the day that Plaintiff was taken to the ER.\n2\n\nPlaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and\npunitive damages. (/d. at TI] 56-59).\n\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who\nis immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nAmended Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent\nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at\n94.\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d Id.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before\n\n3\n\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the Court must\ngrant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or\nfutile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\nasserted. See id. at 11.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\n\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCenturion. Plaintiff raises claims related to the action or inaction of prison\nmedical personnel that took place during the month of March 2020. Plaintiff names two\ncontract medical providers as defendants: Connections CSP and Centurion of\nDelaware, LLC. The Court takes judicial notice that Centurion replaced Connections as\nthe contract medical provider for Delaware Department of Correction facilities on April 1,\n2020. See Fletcher v. Connections CSP, 2020 WL 5350262, at *14 (D. Del. Sept. 4,\n2020), affd sub nom. Fletcher v. Department of Corr., 856 F. App\u2019x 359 (3d Cir. 2021).\n\nCenturion had no involvement in Plaintiff's medical care prior to April 1, 2020,\nand therefore, it will be dismissed.\n\nPersonal Involvement. Chuks, the on-call medical provider (per the case\ncaption), is a named defendant. There are no allegations raised against Chuks.\nLiability in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action is personal in nature, and to be liable, a defendant\nmust have been personally involved in the wrongful conduct. In other words,\ndefendants are \u201cliable only for their own unconstitutional conduct.\u201d Barkes v. First Corr.\nMed., Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 316 (3d Cir. 2014), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Taylor v.\nBarkes, 575 U.S. 822 (2015). Chuks is named only as a defendant and nothing points\nto Chuks\u2019 personal involvement in Plaintiff's claims. Therefore, Chuks will be dismissed.\n\nMedical Claims. Plaintiff's claims rest upon delay in medical care and the type\nof treatment provided him by Defendants Connections CSP, medical provider Ngwa, Dr.\nCunningham, and R.N. Fomundam. A prison official's \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious\nmedical needs of prisoners\u201d is a kind of cruel and unusual punishment \u201cproscribed by\n\n5\nthe Eighth Amendment.\u201d Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). See also Brown\nv. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011) (when a prison deprives a prisoner of adequate\nmedical care, courts have a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth Amendment\nviolation); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (under the Eighth Amendment,\nprisons officials must ensure inmates receive adequate medical care).\n\nIn order to set forth a cognizable claim, an inmate must allege (i) a serious\nmedical need and (ii) acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate deliberate\nindifference to that need. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 104; Rouse v. Plantier, 182\nF.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999). A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he knows that\na prisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to\navoid the harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). A \u201cprison official may\nmanifest deliberate indifference by intentionally denying or delaying access to medical\ncare.\u201d Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 104-05. A \u201cfailure to provide adequate care [that]\nwas deliberate, and motivated by non-medical factors\u201d is actionable under the Eighth\nAmendment, but \"inadequate care [that] was a result of an error in medical judgment\u2019 is\nnot. Durmer v. O\u2019Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nIn addition, \u201ca prisoner does not have the right to choose a specific form of\nmedical treatment.\u201d Lasko v. Watts, 373 F. App\u2019x 196, 203 (3d Cir. 2010) (cleaned up).\nAn inmate\u2019s claims against members of a prison medical department are not viable\nunder \u00a7 1983 where the inmate receives continuing care, but believes that more should\nhave been done by way of diagnosis and treatment and maintains that options available\nto medical personnel were not pursued on the inmate\u2019s behalf. Estelle v. Gamble, 429\n\n6\n\nU.S. at 107. In addition, allegations of medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish\na constitutional violation. See White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 108-09 (3d Cir. 1990);\nsee also Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 332-34 (1986) (negligence is not\ncompensable as a constitutional deprivation).\n\nAs pled, the allegations fail to state cognizable medical needs claims. Plaintiff\nclaims that he was misdiagnosed by Ngwa. At most, this alleges negligence. Plaintiff\nalleges that Dr. Cuningham examined him and made a false entry in his medical record.\nNeither rises to the level of a constitutional violation. Plaintiff alleges that R.N.\nFomundam provided him treatment, which he seems to assert was inadequate. Finally,\nConnections is mentioned only to the extent that it \u201cwas responsible for the health care\nof prisonerfs].\u201d (D.I. 14). This does not suffice to state a deliberate indifference\nclaim. Accordingly, the operative pleading will be dismissed failure to state claims upon\nwhich relief can be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). Because it is possible\nthat Plaintiff may be able to state cognizable claims, he will be given leave to amend.\n\nMOTIONS\n\nMotion to Amend (D.I. 13). The Court will dismiss as moot Plaintiff's motion to\namend the complaint. It appears to be identical to the amended complaint found at\nDocket Item 7.\n\nRequest for Counsel (D.I. 14). Plaintiff requests counsel. Pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1), the court may request an attorney to represent any person unable\nto afford counsel. Section 1915(e)(1) confers the district court with the power to request\nthat counsel represent a litigant who is proceeding in forma pauperis. Plaintiff has\n\n7\n\nnever sought in forma pauperis status. He paid the filing fee and the court docket does\nnot indicate that he qualifies for counsel under \u00a7 1915. Therefore, the request for\ncounsel will be denied.\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss as moot Plaintiffs motion to\namend the complaint; (2) deny Plaintiff's request for counsel; and (3) dismiss the\nComplaint for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). Plaintiff will be given leave to amend.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nKUSHAL KALPAN SHAH,\n\nVv.\n\nPlaintiff,\n\nCivil Action No. 21-470-RGA\n\nCONNECTIONS, CSP, etal.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 8\" day of April, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the\n\nmemorandum opinion issued this date;\n\nIT IS ORDERED that:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\nThe motion to amend the complaint (D.I. 13) is DISMISSED as moot.\nThe request for counsel (D.I. 14) is DENIED.\nThe Complaint is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\n\nPlaintiff is given leave to file an amended complaint on or before May 5,\n\n2022.
