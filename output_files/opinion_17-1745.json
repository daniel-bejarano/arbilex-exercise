(D.I. 2; D.l. 19) The State filed an\nAnswer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 26; D.I. 33) For the\nreasons discussed, the Court will deny the Petition.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual History\n\n[Petitioner], using the profile \u201cpurecolombianblood,\u201d met Wolf\non the internet. On January 29, 2010, Wolf picked up\n[Petitioner] at a Newark grocery store, and together they\ndrove to Wolf's home in Smyrna, Delaware. There they drank\nbeer and watched television. On February 14, 2010, Wolf\nsent [Petitioner] an email asking to meet again in person. Wolf\npicked up [Petitioner] from the Newark library at around 3:00\np.m., and the two bought beer before driving to Wolf's house.\nAccording to [Petitioner], they went upstairs to Wolf's bedroom\nto watch television and drink beer. Eventually, as Wolf\nattempted to touch [Petitioner] sexually, [Petitioner] claimed\nthat he noticed a nine-inch knife on the nightstand. [Petitioner]\ntestified that Wolf reached for the knife when he rebuffed\nWolfs advances, but [Petitioner] grabbed the knife first.\n[Petitioner] sliced Wolf across the throat. Wolf then chased\n[Petitioner] out of the room, yelling at him to get out.\n\nFearful that Wolf would call the police, [Petitioner] testified that\nhe returned to the upstairs bedroom and found the door\nlocked. He kicked the door open, shot Wolf with a BB gun, and\nstabbed him repeatedly. Once he was sure Wolf was dead,\n[Petitioner] pulled the bedding, the mattress, and the dresser\non top of Wolf. He opened the windows and turned off the\nheat, despite it being a cold February day. [Petitioner] then\nretrieved the beer from the kitchen and packed a box with\nsome of Wolfs belongings, including CDs, cellphones, a\nbeeper, Wolf's laptop, and three sets of keys. [Petitioner] then\nleft in Wolf's distinctive green 1994 Volkswagen Jetta. He\nstopped at a Kmart to buy new clothing and to dispose of his\nbloody clothes and shoes.\n\nOn February 15, 2010, [Petitioner] drove Wolf's car to the\nNewark Farmers Market. He used Wolfs credit card to\npurchase two tasers and three knives. He then threw the knife\nthat he used to stab Wolf and the BB gun in a creek near his\nhome. He left Wolf's laptop buried in the snow in Deacons\nWalk Park. Finally, he abandoned Wolf's Jetta in Brook\nHaven Park.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, after Wolf failed to show up to work,\ntwo of his coworkers went to his home to check on him. They\nnoticed the windows were open and saw his wallet and other\npersonal belongings scattered on the front lawn. They called\nthe police, who discovered Wolf's body upstairs.\n\nThe police sent a desktop computer recovered from Wolfs\nhome to the State Police High Tech Crimes Unit for analysis.\nLater that same day, a tree surgeon in Deacons Walk Park\ndiscovered Wolfs laptop under the snow. The police\nanalyzed both of Wolf's computers and discovered that Wolf\nhad communicated with someone using the screen name\n\u201cpurecolombianblood\u201d on January 29 and February 14. An\ninternet search of \u201cpurecolombianblood\u201d led to pictures and\nonline profiles that linked the screen name to [Petitioner]. The\npolice also learned that Wolf's credit card had been used at\nthe Newark Farmers Market on February 15. A February 15\nsurveillance video of the Farmers Market parking lot showed\nWolf's distinctive green Jetta pulling in and leaving, though the\ndriver and the license plate number could not be identified.\n\nThe police secured a nighttime search warrant and went to\n[Petitioner's] house around midnight on February 22, 2010.\nThe search warrant affidavit alleged that there was probable\ncause to suspect that [Petitioner] had stolen Wolf's car and\nused his credit card. At [Petitioner's] house, the police\ndiscovered the keys to Wolf's missing Jetta in the pocket of a\npair of [Petitioner's] pants. The police brought [Petitioner] in\nfor questioning in the early hours of February 23. After\nreading [Petitioner] his Miranda rights, Detective William\nPorter said, \u201cHaving these rights in mind, do you wish to talk\nto me about this case? Tell me your side of the story.\u201d\n[Petitioner] answered, \u201cI don't know. What would be better? If\n\n3\n| talk to a lawyer.\u201d The detective replied, \u201cI mean it's up to you\n| mean, it's perfectly up to you | mean. It be nice to get your\nahh side of the story out because if you don't get your side of\nthe story out we got to go with ... you know what I'm saying?\u201d\n[Petitioner] said he understood. The detective then said,\n\u201cOkay. So you wish to tell me your side of the story?\u201d\n[Petitioner] replied, \u201cYeah why not.\u201d\n\n[Petitioner] then described the events of February 14 and 15.\nHe also told the detective where Wolf's Jetta was and where\nthe police could find the knife he used to stab Wolf. The police\nsubsequently located Wolf's car in Brook Haven Park, where\n[Petitioner] said it would be, and the knife in the creek near his\nhouse.\nRestrepo-Duque v. State, 130 A.3d 340 (Table), 2015 WL 9268145, at *1-2 (Del. Dec.\n17, 2015).\nB. Procedural History\nOn June 7, 2010, a Kent County Grand Jury indicted Petitioner on charges of\nfirst degree murder, possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony\n(PDWDCF), theft of a motor vehicle, second degree forgery, and carrying a concealed\ndangerous instrument. (D.I. 27-16 at 31-33) In November 2012, Petitioner filed a\nmotion in limine, a motion to suppress, a motion for a Franks hearing,? and a motion to\nprohibit the death penalty. See Restrepo-Duque, 2015 WL 9268145, at *2. The\nSuperior Court denied the motions, and the State withdrew its intent to seek the death\n\npenalty prior to trial. See id. at *2; (D.I. 27-1 at 15, Entry No. 125) On February 4,\n\n2014, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of all charges except second\n\n3In Franks v. Delaware, the Supreme Court held that there are some circumstances\nwhere a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to challenge the truthfulness of\nfacts alleged in support of a search-warrant application.\u201d Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S.\n154, 164-64 (1979).\n\n4\ndegree forgery. See Restrepo-Duque, 2015 WL 9268145, at *2; (D.I. 27-1 at 18, Entry\nNo. 148)\n\nOn April 15, 2014, the Superior Court held an office\n\nconference regarding the transcripts of [Petitioner's] police\n\ninterview that were submitted to the jury during trial. The court\n\nfound the submission of the transcripts to be conceivably\n\nprejudicial to [Petitioner] and granted a new trial on May 6,\n\n2014. The second jury trial was held from November 17 to\n\n26, 2014. Wolf's laptop and the social media posts linking\n\n\u201cpurecolombianblood\u201d to [Petitioner] were admitted into\n\nevidence. [Petitioner] was again convicted of second degree\n\nmurder, possession of a deadly weapon during the\n\ncommission of a felony, theft of a motor vehicle, and carrying\n\na concealed dangerous instrument.\nRestrepo-Duque, 2015 WL 9268145, at *3. In January 2015, the Superior Court\nsentenced Petitioner to thirty years at Level V incarceration, followed by decreasing\nlevels of supervision. See id. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's\nconvictions on December 17, 2015. See id. at *7. Petitioner filed a motion for rehearing\nen banc, which the Delaware Supreme Court denied on January 12, 2016. (D.I. 26 at 2)\nThe United States Supreme Court denied Petitioner's petition for a writ of certiorari on\nJune 6, 2016, and denied his petition for rehearing on August 8, 2016. See Restrepo-\nDuque v. Delaware, 136 S.Ct. 2413 (2016); Restrepo-Duque v. Delaware, 137 S.Ct. 16\n(2016).\n\nOn January 6, 2017, while represented by counsel, Petitioner filed a motion for\npostconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61. (D.lI. 27-1\nat 24, Entry No. 209) Petitioner's original Rule 61 counsel was suspended from the\npractice of law on January 26, 2017, and the Superior Court appointed the Office of\nConflicts Counsel to represent Petitioner in his Rule 61 proceeding. (D.1. 26 at 3)\n\n5\nAppointed Rule 61 counsel filed an amended Rule 61 motion in June 2018. (D.1. 27-1\nat 28, Entry No. 239) In July 2018, Petitioner filed a motion to discharge appointed Rule\n61 counsel along with a pro se Rule 61 motion. (D.|. 27-1 at 29, Entry No. 245) On\nAugust 1, 2018, after a colloquy, a Superior Court Commissioner granted Petitioner's\nmotion to proceed pro se and dismissed appointed Rule 61 counsel from\nrepresentation. (D.I. 27-1 at 30-31, Entry Nos. 253, 254) Petitioner filed an amended\nRule 61 motion, and the State filed a response in opposition. (D.I. 26 at 3) On April 16,\n2019, a Delaware Superior Court Commissioner issued a Report and Recommendation\nthat Petitioner's Rule 61 motion should be denied as procedurally barred under Rule\n61(i)(3) and as previously adjudicated under Rule 61(i)(4). See State v. Restrepo-\nDuque, 2019 WL 1772423, at *10 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 16, 2019). On June 20, 2019,\nthe Superior Court adopted the Report and Recommendation and denied Petitioner's\nRule 61 motion. See id. Petitioner did not appeal that decision.\n\nC. Procedural History in the District of Delaware\n\nIn July 2017, Petitioner filed in this Court a civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1983. (See D.I. 1 in Restrepo-Duque v. State, Civ. A. NO. 17-1044-GMS) In\nDecember 2017, the Honorable Gregory M. Sleet issued an Order directing the Clerk to\nopen a new habeas case, designating three documents from Petitioner's \u00a7 1983 case\nas constituting a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 seeking federal habeas relief. (D.1. 1)\nIn September 2018, Petitioner's case was re-assigned to this Court's docket. The Court\nissued an initial AEDPA Order informing Petitioner that papers he originally filed in his\n\n\u00a7 1983 action (Restrepo v. Phelps, Civ. A. No. 17-1744-CFC) had been liberally\nconstrued to request federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 resulting in the\nopening of a new habeas case. (D.I. 6) The liberally construed papers consisted of: (1)\na document titled \u201cWrit of Error\u2019 wherein Petitioner referred to the Uniform Commercial\nCode and stated that all of the charges against him must be dismissed and the charges\nwithdrawn and nullified (D.1. 2 at 1); (2) a document alleging his actual innocence (D.1.\n2-1 at 6); (3) an affidavit alleging that all of his constitutional rights had been violated\nand that the case must be dismissed (D.I. 2-2 at 12); and (4) a copy of a Rule 61 motion\nfor post-conviction relief Petitioner had filed in the Delaware Superior Court (D.I. 2-2 at\n5-12). The initial AEDEPA Order advised Petitioner that AEDPA applies to his\nproceeding, informed Petitioner about certain procedural consequences of AEDPA\u2019s\napplication, and also contained a routine AEDPA Election Form for Petitioner to indicate\nhow he wished to proceed. (D.I. 6) Given the uncertainty surrounding Petitioner's intent\nregarding the liberally construed documents, the Court also directed the Clerk of the\nCourt to attach a form \u00a7 2254 petition so that he could clarify his claims if he still wished\nto seek habeas relief. (D.I. 6)\n\nPetitioner did not file the AEDPA Election Form indicating how he wished to\nproceed or a completed form \u00a7 2254 petition clarifying his claims. The Court issued an\nOrder to Show Cause which: (1) directed Petitioner to inform the Court in writing if he\nwished to proceed with the instant habeas proceeding; and (2) advised Petitioner that\nfailing to inform the Court how he wished to proceed would result in the Court summarily\ndismissing the petition for failure to prosecute. (D.I. 11 at 3) Petitioner ultimately filed\n\nthe amended Petition pending before the Court. (D.I. 19) The State filed an Answer in\nOpposition (D.1. 26), to which Petitioner filed a Reply (D.I. 33). The Petition is ready for\nreview.\nli. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences . . .\nand to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d Woodford v. Garceau,\n538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas\npetition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of\nthe Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).\nAdditionally, AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for analyzing the\nmerits of a habeas petition in order to \u201cprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure\nthat state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d Bell v.\nCone, 535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002).\nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v.\nConnor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states, in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\nshall not be granted unless it appears that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the\ncourts of the State; or\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective\n\nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such process\n\nineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of comity,\ngives \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking\none complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan,\n526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the\nhabeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct\nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court\nto consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005);\nCastille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised the issue on direct\nappeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted and the petitioner does\nnot need to raise the same issue again in a state post-conviction proceeding. See\nLambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and further\nstate court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the federal\ncourt will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted. See\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet[] the\ntechnical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer available);\nsee also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims, however, are\nprocedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153,\n\n160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state\u2019s\nhighest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the merits of the\nclaim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted\nbut procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S.\n255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims\nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if\nthe court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260\n(3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause for a procedural\ndefault, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor external to the defense\nimpeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier,\n477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show that\nthe errors during his trial created more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that\nthe errors worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial\nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d /d. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d then a federal court\ncan excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451\n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). The miscarriage of justice\n\nexception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means factual\n\n4Murray, 477 U.S. at 496.\n10\ninnocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623\n(1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual innocence by asserting\n\u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy\neyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u2014that was not presented at trial,\u201d\nshowing that no reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Hubbard v. Pinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nC. Standard of Review\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the\nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if\nthe state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates,\u201d or the state court's decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts\nbased on the evidence adduced in the trial. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see also Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn, 250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001). A\nclaim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d) if the state\ncourt decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a\nprocedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir.\n2009). The deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s order is\nunaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d\n\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011). As explained by the Court in Harrington,\n\n11\n\u201cit may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the\nabsence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d /d. at 99.\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the\nstate court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This\npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is\nonly rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1);\nCampbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-EI v. Cockrell, 537 U.S.\n322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies\nto factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2)\napplies to factual decisions).\nIl. | DISCUSSION\nThe timely-filed Petition effectively asserts four Claims:5 (1) the Superior Court\n\nviolated Petitioner's Fourth Amendment rights by failing to suppress evidence\n\n5The Petition purports to assert seven claims: (1) the search and arrest warrants lacked\nprobable cause, and the Superior Court erred by not suppressing the evidence\ndiscovered as a result of the ensuing illegal search; (2) the Superior Court erred by not\nsuppressing the statement Petitioner provided to the police, because: (a) the police\nviolated his Fifth Amendment rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) by\nignoring his request for counsel, and (b) the police also failed to inform Petitioner of his\nrights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention; (3) the Superior Court should have\nsuppressed the portion of Petitioner's statement obtained after a police officer made a\npromise of confidentiality; (4) the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant should\nhave been suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree, because the search warrant\nlacked probable cause; (5) the Superior Court violated Delaware evidentiary rules by\nadmitting computer evidence and a social media post; (6) the Superior Court erred in\nadmitting the knife into evidence because the length of the knife did not match the\nlength of the wound; and (7) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during\nclosing and rebuttal argument. (D.I. 20 at 11-12) The Court has consolidated the\nrepetitive and related assertions, leaving the four Claims identified above.\n\n12\ndiscovered through the execution of invalid search and arrest warrants; (2) the Superior\nCourt erroneously admitted his incriminating police statement, because the statement\nwas procured in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), Article 36 of the\nVienna Convention, and a promise of confidentiality; (3) the Superior Court erred by\nadmitting evidence found on Petitioner\u2019s laptop computer, Petitioner's social media post,\nand the knife; and (4) the State engaged in several instances of prosecutorial\nmisconduct.\n\nA. Claim One: Fourth Amendment Violations\n\nIn Claim One, Petitioner contends that his Fourth Amendment rights were\nviolated by the admission of evidence seized pursuant to the execution of the search\nand arrest warrants, because the warrants lacked probable cause. The State properly\nargues that this Fourth Amendment Claim is not cognizable on federal habeas review\nunder the doctrine established in Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 494 (1976). In Stone,\nthe Supreme Court held that a federal court cannot review a Fourth Amendment claim if\nthe petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claim in the state court. See\nalso Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 293 (1992). A petitioner is considered to have had a\nfull and fair opportunity to litigate such claims if the state has an available mechanism\nfor suppressing evidence seized in or tainted by an illegal search or seizure, irrespective\nof whether the petitioner actually availed himself of that mechanism. See U.S. ex rel.\nHickey v. Jeffes, 571 F.2d 762, 766 (3d Cir. 1978); Boyd v. Mintz, 631 F.2d 247, 250\n(3d Cir. 1980). Conversely, a petitioner has not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate\n\na Fourth Amendment claim, and therefore avoids the Stone bar, if the state system\n\n13\ncontains a structural defect that prevented the state court from fully and fairly hearing\nthe petitioner's Fourth Amendment argument. See Marshall v. Hendricks, 307 F.3d 36,\n82 (3d Cir. 2002). Notably, \u201can erroneous or summary resolution by a state court of a\nFourth Amendment claim does not overcome the [Stone] bar.\u201d /d.\n\nIn this case, Petitioner filed a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence pursuant\nto Rule 41 of the Delaware Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Superior\nCourt denied the suppression motion after conducting a hearing. Petitioner then\nchallenged that decision in his direct appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's judgment, explaining that \u201cthere\nwas sufficient information to support the finding of probable cause, and the omitted\ninformation would not have affected the overall mix of information to change the\noutcome.\u201d Restrepo-Duque, 2015 WL 9268145, at *4.\n\nThis record clearly demonstrates that Petitioner was afforded a full and fair\nopportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claims in the Delaware state courts. The\nfact that Petitioner disagrees with the Delaware state courts\u2019 decisions and their\nreasoning does not overcome the Stone bar. Therefore, the Fourth Amendment\nargument in Claim One is barred by Stone.\n\nB. Claim Two: Improper Admission of Petitioner\u2019s Police Statement\n\nNext, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court erred in admitting his\nincriminating police statement for three reasons: (a) the police proceeded to interrogate\n\nhim after he requested counsel in violation of Miranda; (b) the police did not advise\n\n14\nPetitioner of his rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention; and (c) a police officer\nmade and then violated \u201ca promise of confidentiality to [Petitioner] (D.I. 20 at 61).\n1. Miranda\n\nPetitioner presented Claim Two (a) to the Delaware Supreme Court on direct\nappeal, which denied the argument as meritless. Therefore, Petitioner will only be\nentitled to federal habeas relief for Claim Two (a) if the Delaware Supreme Court's\ndecision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nfederal law.\n\nThe clearly established federal law governing a person\u2019s Fifth Amendment right\nto counsel during a custodial interrogation is the standard articulated in Miranda v.\nArizona and its progeny. In Miranda, the Supreme Court held, inter alia, that statements\nmade by a defendant during a custodial interrogation must be suppressed unless he\nwas informed of and waived his right to counsel or his right to remain silent. See id. at\n477-79; see Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 168 (1986). A suspect wishing to\ninvoke his Miranda right to counsel or his Miranda right to remain silent must do so\nunambiguously. See Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 461-62 (1994) (\u201cBut if a\nsuspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a\nreasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the\nsuspect might be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the\ncessation of questioning.\u201d); see also Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370 (2010)\n(extending Davis requirement of unambiguous invocation to Miranda right to remain\n\nsilent). A request for counsel is unambiguous when the defendant has articulated his\n\n15\n\u201cdesire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the\ncircumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d Davis,\n512 U.S. at 459. A request to remain silent is unambiguous when the defendant states\nthat he wants to remain silent or that he does not want to talk with the police. See\nBerghuis, 560 U.S. at 381. If the defendant \u201cclearly invokes\u201d his right to counsel, the\npolice may not interrogate him unless counsel is made available or the defendant\ninitiates the contact. See Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 485-87 (1981).\n\nA defendant may waive his right to counsel but, in order for a waiver of Miranda\nrights to be valid: (1) \u201cthe relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the\nsense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,\ncoercion, or deception\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe waiver must have been made with a full awareness\nof both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision\nto abandon it.\u201d Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421 (1986). A police statement can be\ninvoluntary even if it is made after the defendant was advised of, and waived, his\nMiranda rights. A court determines if a statement was voluntarily made by evaluating\nthe \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d to ascertain if the\ndefendant made an uncoerced choice and had the requisite level of comprehension.\nSee Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 725 (1979); Miller v. Fenton, 796 F.2d 598, 604\n(3d Cir. 1986). \u201c[C]oercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a\nstatement is not \u2018voluntary.\u201d Connelly, 479 U.S. at 167. \u201c[C]oercion can be mental as\nwell as physical.\u201d Blackbur v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 206 (1960). When determining\n\nvoluntariness under the totality of the circumstances standard, a court must consider a\n\n16\nnumber of factors in addition to \u201cthe crucial element of police coercion,\u201d such as \u201cthe\nlength of the interrogation, its location, its continuity, the defendant's maturity,\neducation, physical condition, and mental health\u201d and the failure of police to advise the\ndefendant of his Miranda rights. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 693-94 (1993); see\nalso Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 226 (1973) (discussing factors). Ifa\ndefendant was advised of his Miranda rights and voluntarily waived them, it will be\ndifficult to claim that his statement was nonetheless involuntary. See Missouri v.\nSeibert, 542 U.S. 600, 609 (2004) (noting that \u201cmaintaining that a statement is\ninvoluntary even though given after warnings and voluntary waiver of rights requires\nunusual stamina\u2019); see also Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 433 n. 20 (1984)\n(\u2018[C]ases in which a defendant can make a colorable argument that a self-incriminating\nstatement was \u2018compelled\u2019 despite the fact that the law enforcement authorities adhered\nto the dictates of Miranda are rare.\u201d). Notably, even if the government uses\npsychological tactics to obtain a statement from a suspect, a statement is still\nconsidered voluntary as long as the suspect's decision to confess is a \u201cproduct of the\nsuspect's own balancing of competing considerations.\u201d Miller, 796 F.2d at 604.\nSignificantly, on collateral review, the issue of the voluntariness of a petitioner's\nstatement to police is a legal question that is not entitled to the presumption of\ncorrectness afforded to a state court's factual findings. See Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S.\n104, 112 (1985). A court must examine the record and make an independent\ndetermination as to whether the state court's legal determination of voluntariness was\n\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent. See id. (\u201cthe\n\n17\nultimate question whether, under totality of the circumstances, the challenged\nconfession was obtained in a manner compatible with the requirements of the\nConstitution is a matter for independent federal determination.\u201d); see also Lam v.\nKelchner, 304 F.3d 256, 264 (3d Cir. 2002) (\u201c[U]nder the AEDPA habeas standard, [a\ncourt is] required to determine whether the state court's legal determination of\nvoluntariness was contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court\nprecedent.\u201d). In contrast, state-court findings related to \u201csubsidiary questions, such as\nthe length and circumstances of the interrogation, the defendant's prior experience with\nthe legal process, and familiarity with the Miranda warnings,\u201d are entitled to the\npresumption of factual correctness under \u00a7 2254. Miller, 474 U.S. at 117 (identifying the\npre-1996 version of \u00a7 2254(d) as the applicable statutory section); see also Sweet v.\nTennis, 386 F. App'x 342, 345 (3d Cir. 2010) (identifying \u00a7 2254(e)(1) as the appropriate\nstatutory section). If the state court's \u201caccount of the evidence is plausible in light of the\nrecord viewed in its entirety, the [reviewing court] may not reverse it.\u201d Anderson v.\nBessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985) (describing clearly-erroneous review\ngenerally).\n\nHere, the Delaware Supreme Court rejected Petitioner's argument that the police\nviolated his Fifth Amendment rights under Miranda when procuring his statement,\nexplaining:\n\n[Petitioner] next argues that the Superior Court erred by not\nsuppressing his statement to police. The Superior Court\nfound that [Petitioner] ambiguously invoked his right to\ncounsel. This Court has held that \u201c[w]here a suspect does not\nunequivocally invoke that right, the police should be entitled\n\nto attempt to determine the suspect's intention\u201d and has\n\n18\nendorsed the \u201cclarification approach\u201d which may include \u201cthe\nrepeating of Miranda warnings as a means of emphasizing the\ndefendant's constitutional right to counsel.\u201d However:\n\nIf . . . the police make additional inquiries\nconcerning a suspect's intentions, the clarifying\nquestions may not coerce or intimidate the\nsuspect or otherwise discourage his effort to\nsecure counsel, if that is his intention. Nor may\nthe police tender any legal advice or attempt to\ndissuade the suspect from pursuing an intended\ncourse.\n\nIn this case, [Petitioner] responded to a request to make a\nstatement by saying, \u201cI don't know. What would be better? If |\n\u2018talk to a lawyer.\u201d Detective Porter responded, \u201cI mean it's up\nto you | mean, it's perfectly up to you | mean. It be nice to get\nyour ahh side of the story out because if you don't get your\nside of the story out we got to go with ... you know what I'm\nsaying?\u201d The Superior Court found that detective's statement\nwas \u201cprobably not ideal,\u201d but nonetheless concluded that the\nstatement did not exceed the bounds of clarification permitted\nby this Court in Crawford [v. State, 50 A.2d 571 (Del. 1990)].\nAccording to the trial court, the detective's statement did not\n\u201ccoerce or intimidate\u201d [Petitioner], and did not \u201cdiscourage his\neffort to secure counsel\u201d because the extraneous statements\ndid not reach the level of coercion found in other cases. The\nSuperior Court also relied heavily on the fact that, under the\n\u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the interview did not appear\ncoercive. According to the court, the questioning was\nconversational and [Petitioner] was not outwardly in\ndistress\u2014he expressly agreed to talk to the detective.\n\nThe State does not challenge the ambiguity of [Petitioner's]\nreply to the Miranda warning. Instead, the State argues that\nthis Court's decision in Crawford should be overruled in favor\nof the federal \u201cbright line rule\u201d where police may continue\nquestioning in the face of an ambiguous or equivocal request\nfor counsel. In the alternative, the State argues that based on\nthe totality of the circumstances, the police questioning did not\nexceed the bounds of clarification.\n\nWe decline the State's invitation to overrule Crawford.\nApplying Crawford, we agree with the Superior Court that the\n\n19\npolice questioning was less than ideal. The detective's\nimportuning of [Petitioner] to give his side of the story rather\nthan invoke his right to counsel is troublesome. The\ndetective's answer to [Petitioner's] question could also be\nviewed as advice, rather than clarification. But looking at the\n\u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the detective's statement does\nnot reach the level of coercion found in other cases. The\nquestioning was not intimidating or coercive. Further,\n[Petitioner] responded by saying \u201cWhy not?\u201d Based on our\nindependent review of the interview, we agree with the\nSuperior Court that [Petitioner's] statement was given\nvoluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, and the police did not\nexceed the bounds of permitted clarification. Thus, under the\ntotality of the circumstances, we affirm the Superior Court's\nruling on this issue.\nRestrepo-Duque, 2015 WL 9268145, at *4-5 (citation omitted).\n\nTurning to the inquiry under \u00a7 2254(d) in this case, although the Delaware\nSupreme Court did not explicitly cite clearly established federal law when considering\nthe issues of ambiguity, voluntariness, and waiver with respect to Petitioner's police\nstatement, the Delaware Supreme Court did apply \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d\nstandard when reviewing the merits of Claim Two (a). Therefore, the Delaware\nSupreme Court's decision is not contrary to clearly established federal law. See Fahy v.\nHom, 516 F.3d 169, 196 (3d Cir.2008) (finding that the Supreme Court of\nPennsylvania's decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law because\nthat decision \u201ccomplie{d] with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate to consider the totality of\nthe circumstances.\u201d).\n\nThe Court must also determine whether the Delaware Supreme Court's denial of\nthe instant argument was based on a reasonable application of clearly established\n\nfederal law. The transcript of Petitioner's videotaped police interview reveals that\n\n20\nDetective Porter advised Petitioner of his Miranda rights at the outset of the interview\nand, when asked if he understood those rights, Petitioner responded affirmatively. (D.I.\n27-17 at 29) Petitioner, however, contends that he invoked his right to counsel soon\nthereafter during the following exchange:\nDetective Porter: Okay. Having these rights in mind, do you\nwish to talk to me about this case? Tell me\n\nyour side of the story?\n\nPetitioner: | don\u2019t know. What would be better? If |\ntalk to a lawyer.\n\nDetective Porter: | mean it\u2019s up to you | mean, it\u2019s perfectly\nup to you. It [would] be nice to get your ahh\nside of the story out because if you don\u2019t get\nyour side of the story out we got to go with\n. .. you know what I\u2019m saying.\n\nPetitioner: Yeah, | understand.\n\nDetective Porter: Okay. So you wish to tell me your side of\nthe story?\n\nPetitioner: Yeah why not.\n\n(D.1. 27-17 at 29) According to Petitioner, the phrase \u201cIf | talk to a lawyer\u201d clearly and\nunambiguously invoked his right to counsel, \u201cbecause \u2018IF\u2019 is a conditional word that is\nonly and exclusively used to demand firm conditions.\u201d (D.I. 33 at 10) (emphasis in\noriginal)\n\nHaving reviewed the record, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme\nCourt reasonably determined the facts and applied the totality of the circumstances\nstandard in finding that, although Petitioner ambiguously invoked his right to counsel\n\nunder Miranda, Petitioner's subsequent waiver of his Miranda rights was voluntary,\n\n21\nknowingly made, and the result of his deliberate choice to continue with the interview.\nAfter saying \u201cif | talk to a lawyer,\u201d Petitioner (1) explicitly stated that he understood that it\nwas up to him to decide whether to proceed with the interrogation; (2) said \u201cyeah why\nnot\u201d when asked if he wanted to tell his side of the story; and (3) continued to answer\nDetective Porter's questions. (D.I. 27-17 at 29-100) Viewed in its totality, this conduct\ndemonstrates a waiver of any intention to seek counsel. Thus, the Court will deny\nClaim Two (a) for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n2. Vienna Convention\n\nIn Claim Two (b), Petitioner argues that his police statement should have been\nsuppressed because the police violated his rights under Article 36 of the Vienna\nConvention on Consular Relations by failing to inform him that he had the right to confer\nwith the Colombian consulate upon his detention. (D.I. 33 at 10) The Delaware\nSupreme Court denied this argument as meritless during Petitioner\u2019s direct appeal.\nTherefore, Claim Two (b) will only warrant relief if the Delaware Supreme Court's\ndecision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nfederal law.\n\nIn Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, after refraining to address whether Article 36\ngrants rights that may be invoked by individuals in judicial proceedings, the United\nStates Supreme Court held that the failure to inform a suspect of his consular rights\nunder Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations does not warrant\nsuppression of statements to investigators. See Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S.\n\n331, 350 (2006). The Third Circuit has also held that, assuming that the Vienna\n\n22\nConvention grants individually enforceable rights, \u201c[d]ismissal of [an] indictment and\nsuppression of evidence are not appropriate remedial measures for a violation of Article\n36.\u201d United States v. Castillo, 742 F. App\u2019x 610, 614-15 (3d Cir. 2018).\nIn this case, the Delaware Supreme Court denied Petitioner's instant argument\n\non direct appeal after applying Sanchez-Lilamas, explaining:\n\nArticle 36 secures only a right of foreign nationals to have their\n\nconsulate informed of their arrest or detention\u2014not to have\n\ntheir consulate intervene, or to have law enforcement\n\nauthorities cease their investigation. In this case, suppression\n\nof [Petitioner's] statement would be a vastly disproportionate\n\nremedy for an Article 36 violation. Therefore, the Superior\n\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in denying [Petitioner's]\n\nmotion to suppress.\nRestrepo-Duque, 2015 WL 9268145, at *5. The Delaware Supreme Court's refusal to\nsuppress Petitioner's police statement as a remedy for an Article 36 violation was\nneither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Sanchez-Llamas. Therefore,\n\nthe Court will deny Claim Two (b) as meritless.\n\n3. Promise of confidentiality\n\nDuring the police interrogation of Petitioner, Detective Chorlton stated:\n\n| don\u2019t know if you\u2019re embarrassed about why you were there\nor about seeing him naked or having sex with him or any of\nthat, just understand we don\u2019t... we don\u2019t care about that . .\n. that .. . that is nothing to be embarrassed about in front of\nus, okay. We're not your friends, we're not someone . . . we're\nnot gonna go back and tell anyone, we're having a\nconversation with you okay. So we need you to be 100%\nhonest not just a little.\n\n(D.I. 27-17 at 46) According to Petitioner, Detective Choriton\u2019s \u201cpromise of\n\nconfidentiality\u201d affirmatively misled and/or deceived Petitioner into believing that his\n\n23\nstatement would remain confidential, thereby invalidating any prior waiver of Miranda\nrights. (D.1. 33 at 13)\n\nPetitioner did not exhaust state remedies for this specific instance of alleged\npolice deception because he did not present it as an independent challenge to the\nadmission of his police statement during his direct appeal or Rule 61 appeal. Any\nattempt by Petitioner to assert the instant argument in a new Rule 61 motion would be\nbarred as untimely under Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(1) and as\nsuccessive under Rule 61(i)(2). See Parker v. DeMatteis, 2021 WL 3709733, at *6 (D.\nDel. Aug. 20, 2021). Although Rule 61 provides for an exception to its procedural bars if\na Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a retroactively applicable right that is newly recognized after\nthe judgment of conviction is final,\u201d no such right is implicated in the instant Claim.\nSimilarly, the exceptions to Rule 61 bars contained in Rule 61(i)(5) and (d)(2) do not\napply to Petitioner's case, because he does not allege actual innocence, lack of\njurisdiction, or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to Claim Two. Given these\ncircumstances, the Court must treat the argument as exhausted but procedurally\ndefaulted, thereby precluding habeas review absent a show of cause-and-prejudice or\nthat a miscarriage of justice will occur without a merits review.\n\nPetitioner does not assert any cause for his failure to present his instant\ncontention about the promise of confidentiality to the Delaware Supreme Court on direct\nor post-conviction appeal. In the absence of cause, the Court need not address the\nissue of prejudice. Additionally, the miscarriage of justice exception to the procedural\n\ndefault doctrine cannot be applied to excuse Petitioner's default, because he has failed\n\n24\nto provide any new reliable evidence of his actual innocence. In sum, Claim Two (c) is\nprocedurally barred from habeas review.\n\nNonetheless, even if Claim Two (c) were not procedurally barred, the Claim\nwould not entitle Petitioner to habeas relief. As previously explained, coercive police\nactivity is a \u201cnecessary predicate\u201d to holding a confession constitutionally involuntary.\nSee supra at Section III.B.1. Importantly, however, there is a distinction between police\ntrickery as a means of coercion and police trickery as mere strategic deception; \u201c[p]loys\nto mislead a suspect or lull him into a false sense of security that do not rise to the level\nof compulsion or coercion to speak are not within Miranda's concerns.\u201d Illinois v.\nPerkins, 496 U.S. 292, 297 (1990). A law enforcement agent may use some\npsychological tactics or even actively mislead a defendant in order to obtain a\nconfession, provided that a rational decision remains possible. See Frazier v. Cupp,\n394 U.S. 731, 739 (1969) (stating police misrepresentation that co-defendant had\nconfessed did not render otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible). As a general\ntule, police can lie to a suspect about the extent of the evidence against the suspect or\nfeign friendship with the suspect without fear of rendering the resulting confession\ninvoluntary. See id. at 731, 737-39. \u201cSubtle pressures may be as telling as coarse and\nvulgar ones. The question is whether the accused was deprived of his free choice to\nadmit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.\u201d Garrity v. State of N.J., 385 U.S. 493, 496\n(1967); see also Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 226 (1973) (stating test for\ndetermining voluntariness of confession is whether, in light of all surrounding\n\ncircumstances, defendant's will was overborne).\n\n25\nHere, having already been advised of his Miranda rights, Petitioner was aware\nthat any statements made would be used against him in a court of law. Although a\nknowing and voluntary Miranda waiver does not necessarily demonstrate that a\nsubsequent statement was voluntary, it does show that Petitioner knew he had the right\nto remain silent, yet he still provided a statement. See Oregon v. Elstad , 470 U.S. 298,\n318 (1985) (acknowledging that suspect's choice to speak after receiving Miranda\nwarnings is highly probative of voluntariness). Nothing in the record indicates that\nDetective Choriton\u2019s \u201cpromise of confidentiality\u201d impaired Petitioner's \u201ccapacity for self-\ndetermination\u201d or affected Petitioner's ability to make a rational decision regarding the\ncourses of action available. See Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 225; Wyrick v. Fields, 459\nU.S. 42, 47 (1982). Additionally, when viewed in context, Detective Chorlton\u2019s \u201cpromise\nof confidentiality\u201d was not a promise of non-prosecution but, rather, an attempt to put\nPetitioner at ease about his possible original intent for meeting with Wolf in the first\nplace. See Perkins, 496 U.S. at 297 (\u201cPloys to mislead a suspect or lull him into a false\nsense of security that do not rise to the level of compulsion or coercion to speak are not\nwithin Miranda's concerns.\u201d). Given these circumstances, the Court rejects Petitioner's\ncontention that the Detective Choriton\u2019s statement somehow invalidated Petitioner's\nMiranda waiver. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Two (c).\n\nC. Claim Three: Evidentiary Violations\n\nIn Claim Three, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court violated Delaware\nevidentiary rules by: (1) admitting the evidence found on the laptop computer without\n\nfully establishing the chain of custody for the computer, (2) admitting the social media\n\n26\npost without the proper foundation; and (3) admitting the knife, because the blade was\nshorter than the fatal wound that caused Wolfs death. (D.I. 20 at 12, 75, 78) Petitioner\npresented in his direct appeal his arguments concerning the laptop computer and social\nmedia post to the Delaware Supreme Court, which held that the State properly\nauthenticated the laptop and the social media post in accordance with Rule 901 of the\nDelaware Rules of Evidence. See Restrepo-Duque, 2015 WL 9268145, at *6 and n.36\n(citing Parker v. State, 85 A.3d 682, 687 (Del. 2014) which, in turn, held that \u201csocial\nmedia evidence should be subject to the same authentication requirements under the\nDelaware Rules of Evidence 901(b) as any other evidence.\u201d). Petitioner presented his\nargument concerning the length of the knife blade to the Superior Court in his Rule 61\nproceeding, and the Superior Court provided the following explanation as to why\nPetitioner's argument lacked merit:\n\nThe Medical Examiner testified that this happens when a\n\ndecedent's body is compressed when he/she suffers a stab\n\nwould. The knife was located on the bank of the creek where\n\nRestrepo-Duque said he threw the knife after he stabbed Wolf\n\nwith it. The DNA analysis of the knife produced a partial DNA\n\nprofile consistent with Wolf's DNA. The knife was capable of\n\nmaking that wound and a motion to suppress based on this\n\nassertion would have been baseless. This ground is meritless.\nRestrepo-Duque, 2019 WL 1772423, at *8.\n\nClaims alleging errors in state evidentiary rulings are only reviewable in habeas\ncorpus proceedings if the evidentiary rulings rise to the level of a due process violation.\nSee Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-8 (1991). A petitioner establishes a due\nprocess violation by showing that the evidentiary error was so pervasive that he was\n\ndenied a fundamentally fair trial. See Biscaccia v. Attorney General of State of N.J, 623\n\n27\nF.2d 307, 312 (3d Cir. 1980). Claim Three asserts errors of state evidentiary law, and\nPetitioner has failed to demonstrate any related deprivation of a due process right.\nTherefore, the Court will deny Claim Three for failing to assert an issue cognizable on\nfederal habeas review.\n\nD. Claim Four: Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\nIn his final Claim, Petitioner asserts that the State engaged in prosecutorial\nmisconduct during closing argument and rebuttal by mischaracterizing the evidence,\nproviding personal opinions, and misstating facts not in evidence. (D.I. 20 at 12-13, 81)\nPetitioner presents a series of instances he contends amount to prosecutorial\nmisconduct, such as, inter alia, informing the jury that Petitioner initiated the social\nmedia chats when Petitioner was not the actual sender or receiver in the chats, and that\nPetitioner and Wolf showed each other photographs.\n\nPetitioner did not raise any issues of prosecutorial misconduct to the Delaware\nSupreme Court on direct or post-conviction appeal. As a result, he did not exhaust\nstate remedies for Claim Four.\n\n. At this juncture, any attempt by Petitioner to raise Claim Four in a new Rule 61\nmotion would be barred as untimely under Delaware Superior Court Rule 61(i)(1) and\nas successive under Rule 61(i)(2). See Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(1) (establishing a\none-year deadline for filing Rule 61 motions); Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(2) (providing\nthat second or successive motions shall be summarily dismissed unless they meet the\npleading requirements of Rule 61(d)(2)(i) or (ii)). Although Rule 61provides for an\n\nexception to its procedural bars if a Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a retroactively applicable\n\n28\nright that is newly recognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\u201d no such right is\nimplicated in the instant Claim. Similarly, the exceptions to Rule 61 bars contained in\nRule 61(i)(5) and (d)(2) do not apply to Petitioner's case, because he does not allege\nactual innocence, lack of jurisdiction, or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to\nClaim Two. Given these circumstances, the Court must treat Claim Four as exhausted\nbut procedurally defaulted, thereby precluding habeas review absent a show of cause-\nand-prejudice or that a miscarriage of justice will occur without a merits review.\n\nPetitioner attempts to establish cause by asserting that he presented Claim\nFour\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct argument as part of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim he included in his amended pro se Rule 61 motion filed in the Superior\nCourt in December 2018, but the Superior Court ignored the argument. (D.I. 33 at 21)\nEven if Petitioner's assertion were correct, his default of Claim Four did not occur as a\nresult of the Superior Court's failure to address his argument. Rather, the default of\nClaim Four occurred because Petitioner did not appeal the Superior Court\u2019s decision.\nSince Petitioner does not provide any reason for his failure to file a post-conviction\nappeal, the Court concludes that he has failed to establish cause for his default.\n\nThe absence of cause eliminates the need to address prejudice. In addition, the\nmiscarriage of justice exception to the procedural default doctrine is inapplicable to\nexcuse Petitioner's default because Petitioner has not provided any new reliable\nevidence of his actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Four as\n\nprocedurally barred from federal habeas review.\n\n29\nV. PENDING MOTION\nIn June 2022, Petitioner filed a letter Motion asking the Court to grant his request\nfor habeas relief. (D.I. 36) Given the Court\u2019s conclusion that none of the Claims in the\n\u2018Petition warrant relief, the Court will dismiss the Motion as moot.\nVi. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\nThe Court must decide whether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir.\nL.A.R. 22.2 (2011). A certificate of appealability may be issued only when a petitioner\nmakes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2253(c)(2). This showing is satisfied when the petitioner demonstrates \u201cthat reasonable\njurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or\nwrong.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). Additionally, if a federal court\ndenies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying\nconstitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability\nunless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find debatable:\n(1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and\n(2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling. See Slack, 529 U.S. at 484.\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition fails to warrant federal habeas\nrelief and is persuaded that reasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be\n\ndebatable. Consequently, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.\n\n30\nVil. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny the instant Petition and Motion\nwithout an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n31\n"}
