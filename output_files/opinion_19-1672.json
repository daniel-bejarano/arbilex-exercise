HALL, U.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \nPlaintiffs filed this case as a proposed class action .  They allege that Defendants  caused the  \ngroundwater in Blades, Delaware to be contaminated with perfluorinated chemicals , resulting  in \nharm to the class members\u2019 health and property.  The Court had questions about the  existence of \nsubject matter jurisdiction  and requested briefing from the parties.  This Memorandum Opinion \nconcludes that the Court has subject matt er jurisdiction  and should exercise it. \nI. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs originally filed this action in the Superior  Court of the State of Delaware.  (D.I. \n1 (No. S19C -05-024 (Del. Super. Ct. May 17, 2019)) .)  The original Complaint named as \ndefendants E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. (\u201cDuPont\u201d), Chemours Co. (\u201cChemours\u201d) , 3M Co. \n(\u201c3M\u201d) , Procino Plating, Inc.  (\u201cProcino\u201d) , and Blades Development LLC  (\u201cBlades \nDevelopment\u201d) .  On September 6, 2019, Defendant 3M removed to this Court  pursuant to the  Class \nAction Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d) (\u201cCAFA\u201d).   (D.I. 1 .)   \nOn September 27, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand  back to state court .  (D.I. 8 .)  \nAmong other things, Plaintiffs argued that remand was appropriate under CAFA\u2019s \u201clocal \ncontroversy exception,\u201d 28 U .S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A), its \u201chome s tate exception,\u201d \u00a7 1332(d)(4) (B), \nand its \u201cdiscretionary exception ,\u201d \u00a7 1332( d)(3).   The motion was fully briefed .  (D.I. 9; D.I. 26; \nD.I. 33.)  However, on February 7, 2020, prior to any decision by the Court, the parties filed a joint \nstipulation that resolved the motion to remand .  (D.I. 43.)  The  stipulation indicated that Plai ntiffs \nhad agreed to withdraw their motion in exchange for Defendants\u2019 agreement not to oppose \nPlaintiffs\u2019 request for  leave to file a first amended complaint.   (Id.)  The  Court entered an order \n4 \n confirming the withdrawal of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand  and granting Plaintiff s leave to file an \namended complaint.   \nPlaintiffs filed a  First Amended Complaint  on February 7, 2020.  (D.I. 44.)  The FAC \ndropped  Chemours as a defendant and added  new defendants Atotech USA, LLC (\u201cAtotech\u201d) and \nMacDermid, Inc.  (\u201cMacD ermid\u201d).  (Id.)  The FAC alleges, in pertinent part, that two electroplating \nfacilities in Blades, Delaware  (which are now owned by Defendant s Procino and  Blades \nDevelopment)  used products containing perfluorinated chemicals (\u201cPFCs\u201d) \u2014including \nperfl uorooct ane sulfonate ( \u201cPFOS \u201d) and perfluoro octanoic acid ( \u201cPFOA \u201d)\u2014manufactured an d \nsold by Defendant s Atotech and MacDermid .  The FAC  further alleges that Defendant s DuPont \nand 3M , despite being aware o f the adverse health effects associated  with PFCs , manufactur ed and \nsold PFOS and PFOA -containing products used in the Blades facilities and  also manufactured \nPFOS and PFOA  that were used to produce  PFC-containing products.  Plaintiffs contend  that the \ngroundwater in Blades  has been contaminated by PFCs , causing dam age to pr operty and r esidents,  \nand the FAC  alleges  various causes of action.  Procino answered the FAC , but the other defendants \nmoved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  ( D.I. 55; D.I. 65; D.I. 67; D.I. 69; D.I. 71; D.I. 81.)   \nWhile the motions to dismiss were pending, the Court had questions about the existence of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.  In accordance with its independent duty to satisfy itself of its subject \nmatter jurisdiction,  the Co urt ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing.1  (D.I. 86.)   The \n \n1 The Court requested briefing on the applicability of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d) , including but \nnot limited to the following  issues: (1) whether the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 1332(d)(4) are \njurisdictional; (2) whether the Court may, or must, consider sua sponte  wheth er to decline \njurisdiction under \u00a7 1332 (d)(3) and/or (d) (4); (3) if the Cour t does sua sponte  consider whether to \ndecline jurisdiction under  \u00a7 1332 (d)(3) and/or (d) (4), which party has the burden to establish that \nthe statutory elements are, or are not, sa tisfied; (4) whether the C ourt may apply a rebuttable \npresumption regarding the state citizenship of the proposed plaintiff class;  (5) whether the class \nproposed in the FAC  comprises only United States citizens; and  (6) whether \u00a7  1332(d)(4)(A)(ii) \n 5 \n parties submitted briefing (D.I. 90; D.I. 92; D.I. 93)2 and the Court heard argument on September \n9, 2021.  (Tr. _.)  For the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that it has subject matter \njurisdiction and that it will not declin e to exercise it  pursuant to the CAFA exceptions . \nII. DISCUSSION  \n Defendants argue that the Court has  subject matter  jurisdiction under CAFA.  I agree.  \n CAFA expanded diversity jurisdiction for class actions  for the purpose of getting  cases \ninvolving matte rs of national importance before federal courts.  See Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU \nOptronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 165 (2014) ; Kaufman v. Allstate New Jersey Ins. Co. , 561 F.3d \n144, 149 (3d Cir. 2009) .  Specifically, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2) \u201c provides distr ict courts with \noriginal jurisdiction over cases that have (1) an amount in controversy over $5,000,000; (2) \nminimally diverse parties, meaning at le ast one member of the plaintiff class is a citizen of a state \ndifferent from any defendant; and (3) a class  consisting of at least 100 members.\u201d  Walsh v. \nDefenders, Inc. , 894 F.3d 583, 586 (3d Cir. 2018) . \n Plaintiffs do not currently dispute that each of those elements is  met (and the Court agrees).   \nRather , Plaintiff s contend that this case falls within CAFA \u2019s local controversy exception, \n \nis satisfied.   (D.I. 86. )  The Court denied the pending motions to dismiss with leave to renew within \nfourteen days after the Court rules on the applicability of \u00a7 1332(d). \n \n2 Defendants \u2019 Motion for Leave to File Surreply Brief Regarding Order to Show Cause and \nOpposing Remand (D.I. 95) is DENIED.  6 \n \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A) ,3 its home state exception, \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(B),4 and its discretionary exception, \n\u00a7 1332(d)(3).5  CAFA instructs that district courts \u201cshall decline to exercise jurisdiction unde r \n \n3 The local controv ersy exception provide s: \n(4) A district court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction under [\u00a7 1332(d)(2)] \u2014 \n(A) \n(i) over a class action in which \u2014 \n(I) greater than two -thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff \nclasses in the aggregate are citizens of the State in which the action \nwas originally filed; (II) at least 1 defendant is a defendant \u2014 \n(aa) from whom significant relief is sought by members of \nthe plaintiff class;  \n(bb) whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the \nclaims asserted by the proposed plaintiff cla ss; and  \n(cc) who is a citizen of the State in which the action was \noriginally filed; and  \n(III) principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any \nrelated conduct of each defendant were incurred in the State in which the action was originally file d; and \n(ii) during the 3- year period preceding the filing of that class action, no other \nclass action has been filed asserting the same or similar factual allegations \nagainst any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons  . . . .  \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A).  \n \n4 The home state exception  provides:  \u201c(4) A district court shall decline to exercise \njurisdiction under [\u00a7 1332(d)(2)] . . . (B) [where ] two-thirds or more of the members of all proposed \nplaintiff classes in the aggregate, and the primary d efendants, are citizens of the State in which the \naction was originally filed. \u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)( 4)(B).  \n5 The discretionary exception provides:  \n(3) A district court may, in the interests of justice and looking at the totality of the \ncircumstances, decl ine to exercise jurisdiction under [\u00a7 1332(d)(2)]  over a class action in \nwhich greater than one -third but less than two- thirds of the members of all proposed \nplaintiff classes in the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the State in which t he action was originally filed based on consideration of \u2014 \n(A) whether the claims asserted involv e matters of national or interstate interest;  \n(B) whether the claims asserted will be governed by laws of the State in which the \naction was originally filed or by the laws of other States;  \n(C) whether the class action has been pleaded in a manner that seeks to avoid \nFederal jurisdiction; (D) whether the action was brought in a forum with a distinct nexus with the class \nmembers, the alleged harm, or the defendants ; \n 7 \n [\u00a7 1332( d)(2)]\u201d if the local co ntroversy or home state  exception applies.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)( 4).  \nAnd district courts \u201c may . . . decline to exercise jurisdiction under [\u00a7 1332(d)(2)]\u201d if the \ndiscretionary exception applies.   \n Before examining the applicability of those exceptions, however, the Court will  first \naddress  the parties\u2019 dispute over whether the CAFA exceptions are jurisdictional.   Why does that \nmatter?  It matters because Defendants say that Plaintiffs have waived their right to assert  those \nexceptions.  If the exceptions a re jurisdictional, they cannot be waived, because a party cannot \nwaive a challenge to subj ect matter jurisdiction.   Nesbit v. Gears Unlimited, Inc., 347 F.3d 72, 76 \n(3d Cir. 2003) .  If they are not jurisdictional, the  Court may consider Defendants \u2019 waiver argument.  \nI take each in turn.  \nA. The CAFA Exceptions are Not Jurisdictional. \nThe Third Circuit Court of Appeals  has not squarely confronted the issue, but other Circuit \nCourts have conclude d that the CAFA exceptions are not jurisdictional .  See, e.g., Dutcher v. \nMatheson, 840 F.3d 1183, 1190 (10th Cir. 2016) ; Watson v. City of Allen , 821 F.3d 634, 639 (5th \nCir. 2016) ; Clark v. Lender Processing Servs. , 562 F. App\u2019x 460, 465 (6th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[T]he \nlocal -controversy and home -state exceptions do not de prive a court of jurisdiction.\u201d) ; Visendi v. \nBank of Am., N.A., 733 F.3d 863, 869 (9th Cir. 2013) ( \u201cThe \u2018local controversy \u2019 exception is not \njurisdictional. \u201d); Gold v. N .Y. Life Ins. Co., 730 F.3d 137, 142 (2d Cir. 2013) ; Morrison v. YTB \n \n(E) whether the number of citi zens of the State in which the action was originally \nfiled in all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate is substantially larger than the \nnumber of citizens from any other State, and the citizenship of the other members  \nof the proposed class is disper sed among a substantial number of States; and \n(F) whether, during the 3- year period preceding the filing of that class action, 1 or \nmore other class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other  persons have been filed. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(3) . 8 \n Int\u2019l, Inc., 649 F.3d 533, 536 (7th Cir. 2011) ( \u201cWe recognize that \u00a7 1332(d)(4) does not itself \ndiminish federal jurisd iction. \u201d); Graphic Commc \u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund A v. CVS \nCaremark Corp., 636 F.3d 971, 973 (8th Cir. 2011) .   \nThose courts have reason ed that the statutory comm and to \u201cdecline to exercise\u201d jurisdiction  \nassumes that it is otherwise presen t, and the exceptions are thus akin to abst entio n, which is not \njurisdictional.  See, e.g., Dutcher , 840 F.3d at  1190 (\u201cRather than divesting a court of jurisdi ction, \nthe local controversy exception operates as an abstention doctrine.\u201d); Watson, 821 F.3d at  639 \n(\u201cWe have already recognized that the \u2018local controversy\u2019 and \u2018home state\u2019 exceptions require \nabstention from the exercise of jurisdiction and are not truly jurisdictional in nature.\u201d); Clark , 562 \nF. App\u2019x at  465; Visendi , 733 F.3d at  869; Gold , 730 F.3d at  142; Morrison, 649 F.3d at  536 \n(\u201c[Section  1332(d)(4) ] directs district judges to \u2018 decline to exercise \u2019 jurisdiction otherwise present \nand thus is akin t o abstention.\u201d); Graphic Commc\u2019ns , 636 F.3d at  973.   \nI agree.6  The CAFA exceptions are not jurisdictiona l. \nB. Plaintiffs Have Waived Their Right to Assert the  CAFA Exceptions. \nBecause the CAFA exceptions are not jurisdictional, a party can waive thei r right to rely \non them .  Defendants contend  that Plaintiffs waived their  right to ass ert the exceptions in suppor t \nof a remand .  I agree.  \n\u201c[W]aiver . . . is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d   Barna \nv. Bd. of Sch. Directors , 877 F.3d 136, 147 (3d Cir. 2017)  (cleaned up).  Court s have held that  a \n \n6 The cases cited by  Plaintiffs  are either  unpersuasive or inapposite.  P laintiffs cited the \ndistrict court\u2019 s opinion in Lao v. Wickes Furniture Co ., 455 F. Supp. 2d 1045, 1054\u201359 (C.D. Cal.  \n2006) , but the Ninth Circuit has expressly disagreed with that opinion.   See Serrano v. 180 \nConnect, Inc., 478 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 2007)  (\u201cWe are not persuaded by Lao\u2019 s reasoning \nbecause it is inconsistent with the statute. \u201d).  The other cases cited by Plaintif fs did not  consider \nwhether  the CAFA exceptio ns are jurisdictional.   (Tr. 8:21\u20139:8.)  9 \n party seeking remand  can waive (or forfeit ) its right to rely on a CAFA exception  by failing to \nproperly preserve the  argument .  See, e.g. , Clark, 562 F. App\u2019 x at 465; Visendi , 733 F.3d at 869\u2013\n70; Gold , 730 F.3d at 142.   \nHere,  Plaintiffs clearly and unequivocally waived their  right to rely on the CAFA \nexceptions when they (1) voluntarily agreed to  withdraw their pending motion to remand based on \nthose exceptions  and then (2) invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by filing the FAC .  See Koehnen \nv. Herald Fire Ins. Co., 89 F.3d 525, 528 (8th Cir. 1996)  (\u201cBy the \u2018 mere filing of an amended \npetition, \u2019 [the plaintiff]  \u2018consented to accept the jurisdiction of the Unit ed States court. \u2019\u201d (quoting  \nIn re Moore , 209 U.S. 490, 496 (1908) )); cf. Presidential B ank, FSB v. 1733 27th St. SE LLC , 271 \nF. Supp. 3d 163, 167 n.3 (D.D.C. 2017) ( holding that , by wi thdrawing its motion to remand,  \nplaintiff had waived its right to  request  remand based on forum -defendant rule) . \nC. Regardless, t he CAFA Exceptions Do Not Apply Here . \nEven if Plaintiffs had not waived the argument, I conclude that the CAFA exceptions do \nnot apply here.7  The parties  agree that the burden to prove the  applicabil ity of a CAFA exception \nis on Plaintiff s.   \n 1. Local C ontroversy E xception, \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)  \nThe local controversy exception requires  district courts to decline to exercise jurisdiction \nonly when a number of requirements  are satisfied , including the followi ng: \u201cduring the 3- year \nperiod preceding the filing of that class action, no other class action has been filed asserting the \n \n7 The Third Circuit has not addressed whether a district court may o r must consider the \nCAFA exceptions su a sponte , though othe r courts have done so.  See, e.g. , Adams v. W. Marine \nProd s., Inc., 958 F.3d 1216, 1223\u201324 (9th Cir. 2020)  (\u201c[A]lthough not required to do so, . . . a \ndistrict court may raise sua sponte  an exception to CAFA j urisdiction.\u201d ); Bey v. SolarWorld \nIndus. Am., Inc., 904 F. Supp. 2d 1103, 1108 (D. Or. 2012)  (considering CAFA ex ceptions  sua \nsponte  and concl uding that the  case should be remanded).  10 \n same or similar factual allegations against any of th e defendants on behalf of the same or other \npersons .\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A )(ii).  P laintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the  requirement \nis met here.8   \n Indeed, Defendants have identified multiple  class action  complaints  against 3M and \nDuPont with similar factual allegations  and causes of action as  this one.  ( See D.I. 92 a t 12 n.1, \nExs. A -1\u20134.)  For example, the class action complaint in Henry v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., \nNo. 18- 1924, D.I. 1  (D. Del.  Dec. 4, 2018)  alleged (amon g othe r things) that 3M , despite being \naware o f the adverse health effects associated  with PFCs , manufactured  and sold PFOS, PFOA, \nand PFC -containing products  that made their way into a water  supply in Michigan, causing damage \nto residen ts.  (See D.I. 92, Ex. A -1.)  Those allegations  are factually similar to the allegations \nagainst 3M in the FAC here .  Cf. Brown v. Saint -Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., No. 16- 242, \n2016 WL 6996136, at *4 (D.N.H. Nov. 30, 2016)  (\u201cCourts have found . . . similarities  [for purposes  \nof CAFA]  where plaintif fs alleged nearly identical conduct by the same defendant in diff erent \nstates resulting in the same injury to different plaintiffs. \u201d (citing cases) ).   \n Plaintiffs suggest  that those  allegations are not \u201c the same or similar \u201d wit hin the meaning \nof the statut e because th e other  cases do not involve electroplating  facilities  or injuries in Blades, \nDelaware.   (See D.I. 90 at 15\u201316; Tr.  18:11\u201321, 31:9\u201323.)   I disagree.  T he Third Circuit has \ncautioned that \u201cthe \u2018no other class action \u2019 factor must not be read too narrowly.\u201d  Vodenichar v. \nHalcon Energy Props ., Inc., 733 F.3d 497, 508 (3d Cir. 2013) .  \u201cThe inquiry is whether similar \nfactual allegations have been made against the defendant in multiple class actions \u2014and hence they \nare facing separate, distinct lawsuits \u2014without regard to the procedural posture of the earlier fi led \n \n8 Because all of the  statutory requirements must be met , I need not address the  other \nrequirements.     11 \n cases or whether the putative classes in the cases overlap, their claims arise from an identical event, \nor involve the same causes of action or legal theories.\u201d  Id.  at 508\u201309.  The answer  to th at inquiry \nhere is , \u201cYes.\u201d \n The \u201c no other class action \u201d requirement is not met .  Thus, the  local controversy exception \ndoes not apply. \n2. Home State  Exception , \u00a7 1332(d)( 4)(B), and Discretionary  Exception , \n\u00a7 1332(d)(3)  \n \nFor either  the h ome state or discretio nary exception to apply, all the  \u201cprimary  defendants \u201d \nmust be \u201c citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed .\u201d  28 U .S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(3),  \n(4)(B); Vodenichar , 733 F.3d at 506; see also Dutch er, 840 F.3d at  1194\u201395.  The  FAC alleges, \nand it is not disputed, that Defendant MacDermid is not a Del aware citizen .  (D.I. 44 \u00b6 192.)   Thus, \nif MacDermid  is a \u201c primary defenda nt\u201d within the meaning of the statute, the home state and \ndiscretionary exceptions are inapplicable .   \nAccording to the T hird Circuit,  \ncourts tasked with determining whether a defen dant is a \u201cprimary \ndefendant\u201d under CAFA shoul d assume liability will be found and \ndetermine whether the defendant is the \u201creal target\u201d of the plaintiffs \u2019 \naccusations. In doing so, they should also determine if the plaintiffs \nseek to hold the defendant res ponsible for its own actions, as \nopposed to se eking to have it pay for the actions of others. Also, \ncourts should ask whether, given the claims asserted against the defendant, it has potential exposure to a significant portion of the class and would sustai n a substantial loss as compared to other  \ndefendants if found liable.  \nVodenichar , 733 F.3d at 505\u201306. \n Plaintiffs briefs did not respond to Defendants \u2019 contention that MacDermid is a primary \ndefendant.  (Tr. 13:14\u201317.)   And I agree with Defendants that i t is.  The FAC names  MacDermi d \nas a defendant in five of its eight co unts, and it contends that MacDermi d is directly liable for its 12 \n own actions in manufacturing and sell ing PFC -containing products.  Moreover, the FAC seeks \nsimilar relief against MacDermid  and the ot her defendants.  ( See generally D.I. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 195\u2013289.)    \nBecause Ma cDermid is a primary defendant, the home state and discretionary exceptions \nare inapplicable.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \n The Court has jurisdiction under CAFA .  The CAFA e xceptions are not jurisdic tiona l, \nPlaintiffs waived the right to rely on them, and they don\u2019t apply anyway.  The Court will exercise \njurisdiction over thi s matter.  "}
