{"case_name": "Emerson Radio Corporation v. Emerson Quiet Kool Co. Ltd., et al.", "case_number": "20-1652", "judge": "Judge Leonard P. Stark", "date": "12-16-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nEMERSON RADIO CORP., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nEMERSON QUIET KOOL CO. LTD. and \nHOME EASY LTD. \nDefendants . C.A. No. 20-1652-LPS \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington this 16th day of December, 2021: \nPending before the Court are Defendant Emerson Quiet Kool Co. Ltd.'s (\"Emerson Quiet \nKool\") letter motion for extension oftime to obtain new counsel (D.I. 216) and Plaintiff \nEmerson Radio Corp.'s request for entry of default (D.I. 218). The Court has reviewed the \nparties' submissions (see, e.g., D.I. 216-18) and, for the reasons explained below, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that (1) Emerson Quiet Kool's motion for extension of time (D.I. 216) is \nDENIED; (2) Plaintiff's request for entry of default (D.I. 218) is GRANTED; and (3) the Clerk \nof Court is directed to enter default against Defendants Emerson Quiet Kool Co. Ltd. and Home \nEasy Ltd. (\"Defendants \"). \n1. On December 8, 2021, the Court entered an oral order granting Defendants ' then-\ncounsel's motion to withdraw as attorney. (D.I. 214) In that order, the Court stated that \n\"substitute counsel for Defendants must enter an appearance no later than December 15, 2021.\" \nId. ( emphasis added). The Court also rescheduled the trial date and reset pretrial deadlines , all \n1 predicated on the initial condition that \"new counsel for Defendants appear as required by this \norder.\" Id. \n2. On December 15, 2021, the Court received a letter from Emerson Quiet Kool, \ndated December 14, requesting a \"30-day extension \" to hiring new counsel. (D.I. 216) Plaintiff \nresponded to Emerson Quiet Kool's request on December 15. (D.I. 217) No substitute counsel \nfor Defendants entered an appearance by December 15. Plaintiff then filed a request for entry of \ndefault on December 16. (D.I. 218) \n3. Emerson Quiet Kool's motion for extension of time is denied. The Court agrees \nwith Plaintiff, for all the reasons stated in Plaintiff's response (see generally D.l. 217), that \ngranting Emerson Quiet Kool's request for extension of time is unwarranted. In particular, given \nthat trial is approximately five weeks away, as well as Defendants' pattern of failure to timely \nsecure substitute counsel (both in this case and in related cases before this Court, see D.l. 211 at \n2-3), granting the requested extension would only exacerbate the unfair prejudice Plaintiff has \nalready suffered. \n4. Plaintiff's request for entry of default is granted. In the December 8 order, the \nCourt warned that the failure to have substitute counsel to enter an appearance by December 15 \n\"will result in entry of default' (D.I. 214) (emphasis added), provided that Plaintiff files an \nappropriate motion. Since no substitute counsel for Defendants entered an appearance by \nDecember 15, entry of default upon Plaintiff's request is appropriate here, for all the reasons well \nset out in the record. Plaintiff may file a motion for default judgment , which the Court will \naddress in a timely manner, consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendants \nshould understand that if they wish to oppose the forthcoming motion for default judgment , or if \nthey wish to move to set aside a default judgment , they must first obtain counsel, who must enter \n2 an appearance, and then they will have to meet the applicable standards , which is likely to be \nquite difficult given the course of conduct that has led to this unfortunate result. \nHONO LE LEONARD P. ST \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n3 "}
