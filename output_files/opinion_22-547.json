{"case_name": "Javo Beverage Company, Inc. v. Javy Coffee Company et al", "case_number": "22-547", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "01-25-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJA VO BEVERAGE COMP ANY, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nJA VY COFFEE COMP ANY and JA VY \nCOFFEELLC , \nDefendants. C.A. No. 22-547-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \n(D.I. 20). The motion has been fully briefed. (D.I. 21, 22, 23). For the reasons set forth below, \nDefendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part. \nPlaintiff Javo Beverage Company is a manufacturer and distributor of coffee and coffee\u00ad\nrelated goods, such as coffee concentrates , brews, and extracts. Plaintiff has marketed its products \nunder the wordmark \"JA VO.\" (D.I. 1 at 3). Plaintiff owns U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. \n2,770,052, 3,094,745, and 6,380,252, and has a pending application Serial No. 90,206,690 for \ndifferent marks that contain the word \"JA VO,\" as well as the wordmark \"JA VO.\" (Id at 3-4). \nDefendants Javy Coffee Company and Javy Coffee, LLC (collectively , \"Javy\" or \n\"Defendants \") also market, distribute, and sell coffee and coffee-related goods. (D.I. 1 at 6; D.I. \n21 at 2-3). Defendants market their products under the wordmark \"JAVY\" and own U.S. \nTrademark Registration No. 6,514,951 (the \"Javy Coffee Stylized Mark\"). (D.I. 1 at 6-8; D.I. 21 \nat 2-3). \n1 Plaintiff filed its Complaint alleging that Defendants' use of \"JAVY\" and the Javy Coffee \nStylized Mark infringes Plaintiffs trademarks. Specifically, Plaintiff claims: (1) trademark \ninfringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), (2) unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), (3) \ncommon law trademark infringement and unfair competition, ( 4) unfair competition under \nDelaware Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2532, (5) Defendants' trademark should be \ncanceled under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1119, and (6) unjust enrichment. (D.I. 1 at 9-16). \nDefendants filed the pending motion to dismiss Plaintiffs claims under Rule 12(b )( 6) for \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires a complainant to provide \"a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). Rule \n12(b)(6) allows the accused party to bring a motion to dismiss a claim for \"failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.\" FED. R. C1v. P. 12(b )( 6). A Rule 12(b )( 6) motion may be granted \nonly if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the counterclaim complaint as true and viewing \nthem in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \"could \nnot raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \nThe factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, \nconclusions, or a \"formulaic recitation\" of the claim elements. Id. at 555 (\"Factual allegations must \nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all the \nallegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in fact).\"). Moreover, there must be sufficient \nfactual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when the complaint's factual content \"allows \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" \nId. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops \n2 short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \nDefendants assert four arguments for dismissing Plaintiffs claims. \nI will address them one at a time. \nFirst, Defendants argue that Counts I-V of the Complaint should be dismissed because \nPlaintiff has failed to plausibly allege the existence of a likelihood of confusion between \nDefendants' marks and Plaintiffs marks. (D.I. 21 at 5-17; D.I. 23 at 1-8). \nTo make out a claim for trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham \nAct, Plaintiff must show that Defendants' mark will cause a likelihood of confusion. See A & H \nSportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237 F.3d 198, 210 (3d Cir. 2000); see also Kos \nPharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 708-09 (3d Cir. 2004). Courts in the Third Circuit use \nthe Lapp factors to assess the likelihood of confusion. A & H Sportswear, 237 F.3d at 215. The \nLapp factors that are discussed in the parties' briefs are (1) the degree of similarity between the \nowner's mark and the alleged infringing mark; (2) the strength of the owner's mark, (3) the intent \nof the defendant in adopting the mark; ( 4) the evidence of actual confusion, ( 5) the extent to which \nthe targets of the parties' sales efforts are the same; (6) the relationship of the goods in the minds \nof consumers, whether because of the near-identity of the products, the similarity of function, or \nother factors. (D.I. 21 at 7-17; D.I. 22 at 6-15; D.I. 23 at 1-8). \"None of these factors is \ndeterminative in the likelihood of confusion analysis and each factor must be weighed and \nbalanced one against the other.\" Checkpoint Sys., Inc. v. Check Point Software Techs., Inc., 269 \nF.3d 270,280 (3d Cir. 2011). \nI find Plaintiffs allegations of likelihood of confusion to be plausible. J avo and J avy, both \nmade-up words (which might be suggestive of java, a term often used to refer to coffee), could \n3 easily be confused . 1 Both sides are in the coffee business. There are additional pleadings that are \nharder to evaluate at this stage of the case. I do not think assessing the likelihood of confusion \nfrom a full-blown Lapp factors analysis is appropriate. Plaintiff does not have to prove its case in \nits complaint. \"[T]he existence of consumer confusion is a fact-intensive analysis that does not \nlend itself to a motion to dismiss.\" Applied Underwrit ers, Inc. v. Lichtenegger, 913 F.3d 884, 897 \n(9th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted). I agree. The motion to dismiss for failure to plausibly allege \nlikelihood of confusion is denied. \nSecond, Defendants argue that Count III -alleging common law trademark infringement \nand unfair competition -should be dismissed because it impermissibly combines two discrete legal \nclaims into a single count and is a disfavored \"shotgun pleading.\" (D.I. 21 at 17-18; D.I. 23 at 9). \nI do not think Defendants are right that it is a \"shotgun pleading.\"2 Neither party cites a case for \nthe simpler question of, what happens if Plaintiff pleads two different claims in the same count? \nGenerally speaking, the Federal Rules appear to be fairly non-technical about related issues: \"A \nparty may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either \nin a single count or defense or in separate ones.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 8(d)(2). Thus, in the absence of \ncitation of any case law directly supporting Defendants ' position on this issue, I deny the motion \n1 I do not now need to decide whether the mark is \"suggestive\" or \"fanciful.\" \n2 Defendants cite to Adger v. Carney, 2020 WL 1475422 (D. Del. Mar. 26, 2020) (the \npersuasiveness of which was diminished by the subsequent decision in Adger v. Coupe, 2022 WL \n777196 (3d Cir. Mar. 14, 2022)), Digene Corp. v. Ventana Med. Sys., 476 F. Supp. 2d 444 (D. Del. \n2007), and Talley v. Harper, 2017 WL 413069 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 31, 2017). Those cases, however, \nare distinguishable . For example, Adger and Talley concerned complaints that left defendants, and \nthe court, \"unaware of who exactly is being accused of what conduct\" as they involved multiple \naccused defendants . Adger, 2020 WL 1475422, at *6-7; see also Talley, 2017 WL 413069, at *2 \n(noting the complaint \"does not set out separate claims but rather offers sweeping allegations about \na litany of wrongdoings \"). Given that the claims here stem from the same alleged conduct, I find \nthat neither the Court, nor the Defendants , are left to guess which facts are underlying each claim \nof this Count. \n4 to dismiss on this ground. If Defendants want to reargue the issue, they have two weeks to submit \na brief with citation to relevant authorities. 3 \nThird, Defendants assert that Count VI -alleging unjust enrichment -should be dismissed \nbecause the Complaint does not contain any facts to establish all the elements of an unjust \nenrichment claim. (D.I. 21 at 18-19; D.I. 23 at 10). One of the requirements for an unjust \nenrichment claim is that there be no adequate remedy at law. Trevino v. Merscorp , Inc., 583 F. \nSupp. 2d 521, 533-34 (D. Del. 2008). The unjust enrichment claim is simply a recharacterization \nof the trademark claims. The trademark claims, if proven, provide for an adequate remedy at law. \nIf the trademark claims are unproven, then Defendants have done nothing wrong. The motion to \ndismiss the unjust enrichment claim is granted. \nFourth, in their Reply Brief, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to allege facts that \nDefendants abandoned the Javy Coffee Stylized Mark. (D.I. 23 at 8). It is too late to be making \nnew arguments in the Reply Brief. The motion to dismiss for failure to allege facts about \nabandonment is denied. \nThe motion to dismiss (D.I. 20) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Count VI is \nDISMISSED. ~ \nIT IS SO ORDERED thisJl day of January 2023. \n3 Defendants make an additional argument in their Reply Brief about the sufficiency of the \npleading, but, since they did not make it in their Opening Brief, I do not consider it. \n5 "}
