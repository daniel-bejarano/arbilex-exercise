Civil Action No. 19-1600-RGA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nMatthew P. Denn, DLA PIPER LLP, Wilmington, DE; Christopher Oprison, DLA PIPER LLP, \nMiami, FL, \nCounsel for Cross-Claim Plaintiff Business Insurance Holdings , Inc. \nSeth Niederman , Katelyn M. Crawford, FOX ROTHSCHILD LLP, Wilmington , DE; Robert S. \nTintner, Nathan M. Buchter, FOX ROTHSCHILD LLP, Philadelphia, PA, \nCounsel for Cross-Claim Defendant Adam Potter. \nJanuary ~' 2022 Plaintiffs The American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters and The \nInstitutes , LLC (collectively , \"Plaintiffs \") filed this breach of contract case against Defendants \nAdam Potter, Business Insurance Holdings , Inc. (\"BIH\"), and PBIH, LLC (collectively , \n\"Defendants \"). D.I. 48. BIH asserted five cross-claims against Potter. D.I. 146 at 52-58. \nPending before me is Potter's motion to dismiss Cross-Claim Count V (tortious interference with \ncontractual relationship). D.I. 157. The parties have stipulated to dismiss the other cross-claim \nthat was at issue in the motion to dismiss. D.I. 221. \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn considering Potter's motion, I accept as true all factual allegations in BIH' s Answer \nand Cross-Claim , D.I. 146, and view those facts in the light most favorable to BIH as the \nclaimant. See Worldcom , Inc. v. Graphnet , Inc., 343 F.3d 651,653 (3d Cir. 2003). \nIn June 2018, Plaintiffs entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with BIH (known as \nC&E MGMT and Planning, Inc. at that time) and Potter, the then-owner of C&E. D.I. 48 at ,r,r 9, \n10. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the non-compete and non-solicitation provisions of \nthe Asset Purchase Agreement. Id at ,r,r 151-179. BIH alleges in its Cross-Claim Count V for \nTortious Interference with Contractual Relationship that Potter interfered with a business \nrelationship between BIH and Plaintiffs when Potter provided \"incorrect information\" to BIH \n\"regarding BIH's legal obligations .\" D.I. 146 at 57,r 25. Specifically , BIH alleges that Potter \nrepresented to BIH that its directors and officers could be involved in the creation of ClaimsX \nunder the Asset Purchase Agreement. Id at 54-56 ,r,r 14, 20. BIH also alleges that Potter asked \nthe Acuntos (officers of the corporation that bought BIH) to assist his sister, Sydney Posner, with the creation of ClaimsX. Id. at 57 126. Thus, Potter is liable for any damage his actions caused \nto the business relationship between Plaintiffs and BIH. Id. at 58129. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the complaint must include more than \nmere \"labels and conclusions \" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" \nBell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citation omitted). The complaint must set \nforth enough facts, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Id. at \n570. A claim is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court \nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted). Deciding whether a claim is \nplausible is a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial \nexperience and common sense.\" Id. at 679 (citation omitted). When deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion, the Court \"must consider only the complaint , exhibits attached to the complaint , matters \nof public record , as well as undisputedly authentic documents if the complainant's claims are \nbased upon these documents. \" Mayer v. Belichick , 605 F.3d 223,230 (3d Cir. 2010). \nIII. DISCUSSION \n\"Delaware courts follow Section 766 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts in assessing a \ntortious interference claim. To prevail, [the claimant] must show that: (1) there was a contract, \n(2) about which the particular defendant knew, (3) an intentional act that was a significant factor \nin causing the breach of contract, ( 4) the act was without justification, and (5) it caused injury.\" \nWaveDivision Holdings , LLC v. Highland Cap. Mgmt., L.P., 49 A.3d 1168, 1174 (Del. 2012) \n( cleaned up). Potter argues that BIH has failed to state a claim because BIH must allege that \n2 Potter caused or induced a third person to breach a contract that the third person had with BIH, \nbut, instead, BIH alleged that Potter caused BIH to violate its obligations owed to Plaintiffs . D.I. \n158 at 17-18. BIH responds that its claim arises under Section 766A. D.I. 166 at 7. This \nsection provides: \nOne who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract \n( except a contract to marry) between another and a third person, by preventing the other \nfrom performing the contract or causing his performance to be more expensive or \nburdensome , is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to him. \nRestatement (Second) of Torts\u00a7 766A (1979). \nPotter argues that Delaware courts do not recognize Section 766A claims. D.I. 169 at 7. \nAlthough the Delaware Court of Chancery did acknowledge, \"The cause of action outlined in \nSection 766A is less widely adopted, and has never formally been recognized by Delaware \ncourts,\" it did not outright reject Section 766A. Chapter 7 Tr. Constantino Flores v. Strauss \nWater Ltd., 2016 WL 5243950, at *10 (Del. Ch. Sept. 22, 2016) (footnote omitted). Rather, the \nCourt of Chancery explained that a previous Delaware court \"merely determined that 'Delaware \nwould not reject Section 766A,\"' and concluded , \"The same holds true\" for it. Id. at *10 n.53. \nAnd although the Delaware courts have not formally adopted Section 766A, the Superior Court \ndid indicate a willingness to consider the cause of action. See Allen Fam. Foods, Inc. v. Capitol \nCarbonic Corp., 2011 WL 1205138, at *5 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 31, 2011) (\"[T]he Court finds \nthe views of those judges who have endorsed Section 7 66A as a valid expansion of the law of \ntortious interference of contract to be most persuasive .\"). Given the Delaware courts' apparent \nwillingness to entertain this cause of action, I decline to find that a claim cannot be brought \nunder Section 766A. \nPotter argues that, even if Delaware courts would permit a cause of action arising from \nSection 766A, BIH has failed to sufficientl y allege a claim. D.I. 169 at 6. Potter explains that \n3 Section 766A \"requires specific allegations that the defendant prevented the plaintiffs \nperformance under a third-party contract, which in turn prevented the plaintiff from securing a \nthird party's performance under that same agreement. \" Id. at 9. BIH has alleged only, \"Potter \nprevented BIH from performing its potential obligations owed to Plaintiffs under the Purchase \nAgreement. \" Id. Thus, Potter argues that BIH failed to allege that \"BIH was unable to obtain \nPlaintiffs ' performance under the Purchase Agreement .... \" Id. \nA Delaware court explained: \nSection 766A is intended to address situations where \"the plaintiff is unable to obtain \nperformance of the contract by the third person because he has been prevented from \nperforming his part of the contract and thus from assuring himself of receiving the \nperformance by the third person.\" \nAllen Fam. Foods, 2011 WL 1205138, at *6 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts\u00a7 766A \ncmt. c ). Here, BIH has alleged that Potter interfered with BIH' s performance of its own \ncontractual obligations when he \"directly requested that the Acuntos assist Sydney Posner with \nthe creation of ClaimsX, and specifically told the Acuntos that providing such assistance was \nconsistent with the Purchase Agreement. \" D.I. 146 at 57,r 26; see also id at 57,r 27 (\"To the \nextent that Potter's advice to and requests of the Acuntos caused them to take any actions in \nviolation of the Purchase Agreement , Potter's advice to and requests of the Acuntos were \nwrongful. \"). \nBut Section 766A also requires that BIH allege that it was unable to obtain Plaintiffs ' \nperformance as a result of Potter's interference . See Johnson v. Gov't Emps. Ins. Co., 2014 WL \n1266832, at *5 (D. Del. Mar. 26, 2014) (granting defendant 's summary judgment motion when \n\"Plaintiff has made no showing that any harm alleged from the breach of contract ... impacted \nthe performance owed to the Plaintiff' as required for a Section 766A claim), affd sub nom. \nJohnson v. GEICO Cas. Co., 672 F. App'x 150 (3d Cir. 2016). BIH has failed to make an \n4 allegation of this sort. At best, BIH makes general allegations about damage to a business \nrelationship with Plaintiffs. D.I. 148 at 57, 25 (\"Potter knowingly and tortiously interfered for \nthe benefit of his sister with an existing business relationship between BIH and the Plaintiffs ... \nthereby damaging BIH's business relationship with the Plaintiffs.\"); id. at 58, 29 (\"To the \ndegree that any actions taken by BIH violated the Purchase Agreement and have damaged the \ncontractual relationship between the Plaintiffs and BIH, Potter caused that damage through his \nadvice and requests and is liable for it.\"). At no point does BIH allege that it could not obtain \nPlaintiffs' performance as a result of BIH's inability to perform. Therefore, BIH has failed to \nallege sufficient facts for each element of a Section 766A claim, and I will dismiss it. \nPotter also makes the argument that a party cannot be liable for breach of a contract and \ntortious interference with that same contract. D .I. 15 8 at 19. Because I will dismiss the claim for \nfailure to allege facts for each element of the claim, I do not need to resolve the issue of whether \nPotter, as a party to the contract, can also be liable for tortious inference. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I will grant Potter's motion to dismiss. \n5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nTHE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR \nCHARTERED PROPERTY CASUALTY \nUNDER WRITERS and THE INSTITUTES , \nLLC, \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nADAM POTTER , PBIH, LLC, and \nBUSINESS INSURANCE HOLDINGS , \nINC., \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 19-1600-RGA \nORDER \nAt Wihnington this i day of January 2022: \nFor the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion issued this day, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that Adam Potter's Motion to Dismiss Certain Counts in Business Insurance \nHoldings , Inc.'s Cross-Claim or Alternatively , Sever and Transfer Count I of the Cross-Claim \nand Dismiss Count V of the Cross-Claim (D.I. 157) is GRANTED. Cross-Claim Count Vis \nDISMISSED. "}
