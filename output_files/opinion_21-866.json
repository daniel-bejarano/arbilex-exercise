Fallon", "date": "01-31-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN BUNKERING and )\nTRADING LTD., )\nPlaintiff,\n\nv. 5 Civil Action No. 21-866-LPS-SRF\nLABPRO PHARMA LLC, et al.,\nDefendants and Garnishees.\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\nPresently before the court in this admiralty action are the following motions: (1) Plaintiff\nSouth African Bunkering and Trading Ltd.\u2019s (\u201cSABT\u201d) motion to strike the answer to the\ncomplaint filed by defendants Labpro Pharma LLC (\u201c\u2018Labpro\u201d) and MSBE Ventures Inc.\n(\u201cMSBE;\u201d together with Lapbro, \u201cDefendants\u201d) (D.I. 24); and (2) SABT\u2019s request for entry of\ndefault as to Defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(a) (D.I. 22). For the\nfollowing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT SABT\u2019s motion to strike and GRANT\nSABT\u2019s request for entry of default.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn June 17, 2021, SABT initiated this action by filing a verified complaint with a request\nfor issuance of process of maritime attachment and garnishment. (D.I. 1) The complaint alleges\nthat Defendants ordered a certain amount of marine fuel from SABT for the vessel M/V\nKONYUI and thereafter made a series of partial payments on the invoice, with an outstanding\nprincipal balance of $40,400 plus accrued late charges and interest. (/d. at ff 7-10) SABT filed\nan amended complaint on June 21, 2021. (D.I. 10) On the same day, a writ of garnishment was\n\nissued as to garnishees Bank of America N.A. and GoDaddy.com, LLC. (D.I. 11; D.I. 12)\nDefendants were served with the amended complaint and other filings by way of the Texas\nSecretary of State on June 24, 2021. (D.I. 16; D.I. 17)\n\nDefendants did not file responsive pleadings on or before the deadline to do so. On July\n16, 2021, SABT moved for entry of default. (D.I.22) Three days later, an individual acting on\nbehalf of Defendants filed an answer to SABT\u2019s amended complaint. (D.I. 23) SABT promptly\nmoved to strike Defendants\u2019 answer. (D.I. 24) Defendants opposed SABT\u2019s motion to strike in\nanother filing made by a non-attorney individual acting on behalf of Defendants. (DJ. 25) No\nfurther filings or entries of appearance have been made in this case since July 2021.\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Motion to Strike\n\nIt is well-settled that a corporation must be represented by counsel and cannot be\nrepresented by an individual acting pro se on its behalf. See Simbraw, Inc. v. U.S., 367 F.2d 373,\n337-47 (3d Cir. 1966). The record before the court confirms that Defendants are not represented\nby counsel. Nonetheless, a representative of Defendants filed an answer to SABT\u2019s amended\ncomplaint as well as a response to SABT\u2019s motion to strike. (D.I. 23; D.I. 25) The court has the\nauthority to strike any filings made by a non-attorney on behalf of a defendant corporation. See\nDorsey v. Black Pearl Books, Inc., 2006 WL 3327874, at *1 n.2 (D.N.J. Nov. 14, 2006);\nLaborers\u2019 Dist. Council Const. Indus. Pension Fund v. Compliance Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 2005 WL\n1331059, at *1 (E.D. Pa. 2005). Accordingly, I recommend that the court grant SABT\u2019s motion\nto strike Defendants\u2019 answer to the amended complaint. (D.I. 24)\n\nB. Request for Entry of Default\n\nI further recommend that the Clerk of Court enter default against Defendants pursuant to\n\nRule 55(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (D.I. 22) \u201cWhen a party against whom a\njudgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure\nis shown by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk must enter the party\u2019s default.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P.\n55(a). Here, Defendants did not file any form of responsive pleading until after SABT filed its\nrequest for entry of default noting that the time for Defendants to respond had expired. For this\nreason alone, the entry of default under Rule 55(a) is appropriate. See Securian Life Ins. Co. v.\nDawson, C.A. No. 17-1259-VAC-SRF, 2018 WL 3019107, at *2 (D. Del. June 18, 2018)\n(concluding that entry of default under Rule 55(a) was proper because untimely answer did not\n\u201coffer an acknowledgement or explanation for the late submission[,]\u201d and \u201cfiling an answer does\nnot vacate the default in appearance\u201d absent a showing of good cause under Rule 55(c)). In\naddition to being procedurally improper for the reasons stated at \u00a7 II.A, supra, the answer filed\nby Defendants was not accompanied by a request for extension of time to file a responsive\npleading or any refutation of SABT\u2019s request for entry of default indicating that the time for\nfiling a responsive pleading expired. (D.I. 23); see Yellow Book Sales & Distrib. Co., Inc. v.\nWhite, 2011 WL 830520, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 10, 2011) (declining to grant relief from an entry\nof default under Rule 55(c) where defendant provided no reason for his late submission).\nMoreover, Defendants have been on notice of the requirement for corporate defendants to\nretain counsel at least since being served with SABT\u2019s July 20, 2021 motion to strike, yet they\nhave failed to retain counsel in the ensuing months. See R.W. Sauder, Inc. v. B.F. Agricultural\nAcquisition, LLC, 2015 WL 6503385, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 28, 2015) (concluding that defendant\u2019s\nfailure to obtain replacement counsel \u201cconstitute[d] a failure to \u2018otherwise defend\u2019 against\nPlaintiff's action, for which an entry of default judgment is appropriate.\u201d). As a result,\nDefendants have not yet entered a proper appearance in this matter. See Cambridge Mgmt. Grp.,\n\nLLC v. Baker, 2013 WL 1314734, at *1 n.1 (D.N.J. Mar. 28, 2013) (noting that \u201ca proper notice\nof appearance in the present action is required because artificial entities, such as limited liability\ncompanies along with corporations, may only appear in federal court through licensed counsel.\u201d\n(citing Rowland v. Cal. Men\u2019s Colony, 506 U.S. 194, 202-03 (1993)). Because no proper\nresponsive pleading is on the record and Defendants have not yet properly entered an appearance\nin this matter, entry of default for \u201cfail[ure] to plead or otherwise defend\u201d is warranted. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 55(a).\nII. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT SABT\u2019s motion to strike\n(D.I. 24) and GRANT SABT\u2019s request to enter default as to Defendants pursuant to Rule 55(a)\n(D.I. 22). A copy of this Report and Recommendation shall be mailed to Defendants at the\naddress listed on the docket.\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to ten (10)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage v. Barnhart, 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1\n(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: January 31, 2022\n\nMAGISTRATE JUDGE\n"}
