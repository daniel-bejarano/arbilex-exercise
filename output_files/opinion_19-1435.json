Andrews", "date": "07-11-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nBUS AIR, LLC,\nPlaintiff;\n\nVv.\n\nANTHONY R. WOODS and C.A. No, 19-1435-RGA-CJB\nE3 RIVERS, LLC F/K/A BUS AIR\n\nMANUFACTURING, LLC,\n\nDefendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nBefore me are Plaintiff's objections (D.I. 112) to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Memorandum\nOrder (\u201cOrder\u201d) (D.I. 111) denying Plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration and stay litigation\nrelating to Defendants\u2019 counterclaims (D.I. 86). The Order also denied Defendants\u2019 motion to\nstrike (D.I. 102), to which there were no objections. I have considered the parties\u2019 briefing. (D.1.\n112, 117). For the following reasons, Plaintiffs objections (D.I. 112) are OVERRULED, and the\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s Order (D.I. 111) is AFFIRMED.\nL BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff purchased Defendants\u2019 bus-related air conditioning installation and service\nbusiness pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, or \u201cAPA,\u201d executed on September 25, 2017.\n(D.L 1-1, Ex. A at J 1, 9; id, Ex. 1 (hereinafter, \u201cAPA\u201d) at 1)). The APA provided for a first\npayment of $18,190,000 at closing followed by a second Earnout payment. (APA at \u00a7 3.1). The\nEarnout payment was to be calculated as set out in the APA, in an amount of up to $2,000,000\n(the \u201cEarnout Amount\u201d). (/d.). In the event of a dispute regarding the Earnout Amount, the APA\n\nprovides as follows:\n\nAny disagreement between Buyer [Plaintiff] and Seller [Defendants] with respect to the\ncalculation of the Earnout Amount shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm\n[\u201cIAF\u201d] in the same manner and pursuant to the same procedures as are set forth in\nSection 3.2(e) for resolutions of disputes regarding Final Closing Amounts.\n\n(d.). Section 3.2(e) of the APA relates to Plaintiffs provision of certain calculations (including\n\u201cTarget Net Working Capital\u201d and \u201cClosing Net Working Capital\u201d) that are labeled \u201cFinal\nClosing Amounts.\u201d (APA at \u00a7 3.2(e)). Section 3.2(e) reads, in relevant part:\n\nIf the Company [Defendants] disputes any aspect of Buyer\u2019s [Plaintiff's] Proposed\nCalculations, then the Company shall have the right, at the Company\u2019s expense, to review\nthe Final Net Working Capital. The Company shall complete its review within fifteen\n(15) days after the date the Company disputes Buyer\u2019s Proposed Calculations. If the\nCompany, after such review, still disagrees with Buyer\u2019s Proposed Calculations, and\nBuyer does not accept the Company\u2019s proposed alternative calculations[,] . . . the\nCompany and Buyer shall work together in good faith to attempt to resolve their\ndifferences concerning the Final Net Working Capital and if the Company and Buyer are\nunable to resolve such differences within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the\nCompany\u2019s Proposed Calculations to Buyer, then the Company and Buyer shall direct an\nindependent regional accounting firm to be mutually agreed upon by both parties (the\n\u201cIndependent Accounting Firm\u201d) to resolve remaining disputed items (the \u201cRemaining\nDisputed Items\u201d) within fifteen (15) days after the date of Buyer\u2019s rejection of the\nCompany\u2019s Proposed Calculations by conducting its own review of the Final Net\nWorking Capital and thereafter selecting either the Company\u2019s Proposed Calculations of\nthe Remaining Disputed Items or Buyer\u2019s Proposed Caiculations of the Remaining\nDisputed Items or an amount in between the two. Each of the Company and Buyer agrees\nthat it shall be bound by the Independent Accounting Firm\u2019s determination of the\nRemaining Disputed Items.\n\n(Ud. at \u00a7 3.2(e) (emphasis in original)).\n\nIt became clear that the parties could not agree on the calculation of the Earnout Amount.\n(See D.I. 111 at 4-5). Plaintiff filed a breach of contract action in the Delaware Court of\nChancery. (D.I. 1, Ex. A at 1). The case was then removed to this Court. (D.I. 1). After Plaintiff\nfiled an amended complaint (D.I. 77), Defendants filed their Answer and Counterclaim (D.I. 78).\nThree of the four counts (Counts I-IIT) in Defendants\u2019 Counterclaim reference the parties\u2019\ndispute regarding the Earnout Amount. (See id. at {| 42, 46, 51, 56, 60). Plaintiff moved the\n\nCourt (i) to compel arbitration on Defendants\u2019 Counterclaims I-II] to the extent that they relate to\n\nthe Earnout Amount dispute and (ii) to stay proceedings in this case pending arbitration. (D.I.\n86). The Magistrate Judge denied both motions. (D.I. 111). Plaintiff filed objections to the\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s Order. (D.I. 112). The issue has been fully briefed. (D.I. 112, 117).\nIL. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b), a Magistrate Judge may hear and determine non-dispositive\npretrial motions. \u201cA ruling on a motion to compel arbitration does not dispose of the case, or any\nclaim or defense found therein.\u201d V.I. Water & Power Auth. v. GE Int\u2019l, 561 F. App\u2019x 131, 134\n(3d Cir. 2014); see GNH Grp., Inc. v. Guggenheim Holdings, L.L.C., 2020 WL 4287358, at 2*\nn.l (D. Del. July 27, 2020). Because a motion to compel arbitration is not a dispositive motion,\nthe Magistrate Judge validly issued a \u201cwritten order stating the decision\u201d under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 72(a).! The Court reviews such orders under the \u201cclearly erroneous or contrary\n\n' Plaintiff asserts that its motion to compel arbitration is dispositive because Plaintiff brought the\nmotion under Rule 12(b)(1) and, in the alternative, Rule 56. Courts in the Third Circuit have\nheard motions to compel arbitration under Rule 12(b)(1) while noting their reservations in doing\nso. Hoboken Yacht Club LLC v. Marinetek N. Am. Inc., 2019 WL 7207486, at *7 (D.N.J. Dec.\n26, 2019) (acknowledging \u201cdoubts that Rule 12(b)(1) is the appropriate section under which to\nproceed\u201d). The Third Circuit has observed that \u201cmotions seeking the dismissal of [an] . . . action\non the basis that arbitration is required are not jurisdictional as they raise a defense to the merits\nof an action. Rather, such dismissals are generally effected under Rule 12(b)(6) .. . or Rule 56.\u201d\nLiberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Yoder, 112 F. App\u2019x 826, 828 (3d Cir. 2004); see also James W.\nMoore & Milton I. Shadur, 2 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u2014 Civil \u00a7 12.30 (2022) (\u201c[A] motion\nseeking to enforce the [arbitration] agreement does not challenge the court\u2019s subject matter\njurisdiction and cannot be brought under Rule 12(b)(1).\u201d); see generally Olympus Am., Inc. v.\nCintas Corp. No. 2, 2021 WL 1248523, at *5-*11 (D.N.J. Apr. 2, 2021). Whatever is the\nappropriate procedural styling of a motion to compel arbitration, the Court relies on specific\nstatements by the Third Circuit that the motion to compel arbitration is non-dispositive. See V.[.\nWater & Power Auth., 561 F. App\u2019x at 134 (holding that a motion to compel arbitration is not\ndispositive and that there is \u201cno exercise of Article III power when a Magistrate Judge rules on a\nmotion to compel arbitration\u201d).\n\nPlaintiff also argues that the issuance of a Memorandum Order was inconsistent with the\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s use of the \u201cgenuine issue of material fact\u201d summary judgment standard. (D.I.\n112 at 3 n.4). But Plaintiff confuses the summary judgment motion with the standard used in a\nsummary judgment motion. While a summary judgment motion is a dispositive motion, not\nevery motion that uses the \u201cgenuine issue of material fact\u201d standard is a dispositive motion. See,\n\nto law\u201d standard. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). A ruling is clearly erroneous if \u201cthe reviewing court on\nthe entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\ncommitted.\u201d Evonik Degussa GmbH v. Materia Inc., 2011 WL 3707067, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 24,\n2011). A ruling is contrary to law \u201conly when the magistrate judge has misinterpreted or\nmisapplied the applicable law.\u201d Evans v. John Crane, Inc., 2019 WL 5457101, at *6 (D. Del.\nOct. 24, 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). Though a motion to compel is not a\ndispositive motion, the Court reviews the Magistrate Judge\u2019s legal conclusions de novo because\n\u201cthe phrase \u2018contrary to law\u2019 indicates plenary review as to matters of law.\u201d Haines v. Liggett\nGrp. Inc., 975 F.2d 81, 91 (3d Cir. 1992). Under Delaware contract law applicable in this case,\nthe Court \u201cmay draw its own conclusions as to the written terms of the contract\u201d but should defer\nto the Magistrate Judge \u201con findings of fact based on evidence beyond the four corners of the\ndocument.\u201d Am. Fam. Mortg. Corp. v. Acierno, 1994 WL 144591, at *3 (Del. Mar. 28, 1994).\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nTo determine whether a party submitted to arbitration, a court must consider \u201c(1) whether\nthere is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties and, if so, (2) whether the merits-based\ndispute in question falls within the scope of that valid agreement.\u201d Century Indem. Co., 584 F.3d\nat 527. Under Delaware law, \u201c[w]hen interpreting a contract, the role of a court is to effectuate\nthe parties\u2019 intent.\u201d Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Am. Legacy Found., 903 A.2d 728, 739 (Del.\n2006). Courts will \u201cnot enforce a contract that unclearly or ambiguously reflects the intention to\narbitrate.\u201d Kuhn Constr. v. Diamond State Port Corp., 990 A.2d 393, 396 (Del. 2010); see also\n\nDMS Props.-First, Inc. v. P.W. Scott Assocs., Inc., 748 A.2d 389, 391 (Del. 2000) (\u201cA party\n\ne.g., Century Indem. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, 584 F.3d 513, 528 (3d Cir.\n2009) (applying \u201cthe familiar summary judgment standard\u201d to adjudicate a non-dispositive\nmotion to compel arbitration).\n\ncannot be forced to arbitrate the merits of a dispute . . . in the absence of a clear expression of\nsuch intent in a valid agreement.\u201d). \u201cAmbiguity exists when the provisions in controversy are\nreasonably or fairly susceptible to different interpretations.\u201d Kuhn Constr., 990 A.2d at 396.\n\nCentral to the dispute here is whether the parties intended the Independent Accounting\nFirm (\u201cIAF\u201d) named in the APA \u00a7 3.2(e) to serve as an arbitrator or only as an expert. Drawing\non the analysis of Delaware law that this Court set forth in Sapp v. Indus. Action Servs., LLC,\n2020 WL 2813176 (D. Del. May 29, 2020), the Magistrate Judge considered several factors\nrelevant to determining whether the IAF is to serve as an arbitrator or merely as an expert. After\nconsidering these factors, the Magistrate Judge found that because the parties intended the IAF to\nserve only as an expert, there was no valid arbitration agreement. (D.I. 111 at 21-22).\n\nThe APA text does not expressly state that the [AF would serve as an \u201carbitrator,\u201d and\nthe language of \u201carbitration\u201d and variants like \u201carbitral\u201d is absent from the APA. (/d. at 23-24).\nUnder Delaware law, this lack of arbitration language weighs against a finding of a clear intent\nto arbitrate, though not dispositively. \u201cWe do not require the magic word, \u2018arbitration,\u2019 to find\nthat parties intended to arbitrate, but [a party\u2019s] failure to include the express term[,] . . . coupled\nwith other ambiguities, . . . could lead [one] reasonably to conclude that [the party] had elected to\nforego arbitration of claims.\u201d Kuhn Constr., 990 A.2d at 397. The significance of the lack of\narbitration language is partially offset by the fact that the APA does not expressly label the IAF\nan \u201cexpert, not arbitrator.\u201d (D.I. 111 at 22). But even if there is a convention to use the label\n\u201cexpert not arbitrator\u201d to signal mere expert determination, the convention to include\n\u201carbitration\u201d terms to signal arbitration is plausibly stronger than the convention to include\n\u201cexpert not arbitrator\u201d to signal mere expert determination. See NYC Bar Comm. on Int\u2019] Com.\n\nArbitration, Purchase Price Adjustment Clauses and Expert Determinations: Legal Issues,\n\nPractical Problems and Suggested Improvements 1 n.3, 7-8 (2013) (recommending use of \u201cact as\nan expert and not as an arbitrator language\u201d to indicate non-arbitration expert determination,\nwhile observing that \u201cmany practitioners do not know . . . of the appropriate vocabulary to\ndistinguish [expert determination] from arbitration\u201d). Therefore, the way that the APA labels the\nIAF weighs against a finding of a clear intent to arbitrate. The lack of express \u201carbitrator\u201d and\n\u201cexpert\u201d language means that if there is a clear intent to arbitrate, it would have to be found in\nother indications of the IAF\u2019s role elsewhere in the agreement.\n\nIn a typical expert determination, \u201cthe authority granted to the expert is limited to\ndeciding a specific factual dispute concerning a matter within the special expertise of the\ndecision maker, usually concerning an issue of valuation.\u201d Jd. at 4; accord Ray Beyond Corp. v.\nTrimaran Fund Mgmt., 2019 WL 366614, at *6 (Del. Ch. Jan. 29, 2019). The Magistrate Judge\nfound that the IAF\u2019s authority \u201cis of a fairly cabined scope\u201d related to \u201cparticular factual disputes\nthat are within the special expertise\u201d of the IAF. (DI. 111 at 24). In reaching this conclusion, the\nMagistrate Judge relied on the APA\u2019s provision that \u201c[a]ny disagreements between [Plaintiff]\nand [Defendants] with respect to the calculation of the Earnout Amount shall be resolved by the\n[IAF][.]\u201d (APA at \u00a7 3.1). Under the Magistrate Judge\u2019s construction of this provision, the APA\nrequires the IAF to resolve factual disagreements calling for expert determination regarding a\ncalculation, as opposed to disagreements calling for resolution by legal professionals. (D.I. 111\nat 24-25). Plaintiff objects, arguing that the IAF was not granted such a narrow role because the\nAPA does not restrict the phrase \u201cany disagreements\u201d with the word \u201cfactual.\u201d (D.I. 112 at 8).\n\nThe Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding that the IAF\u2019s role in dispute\n\nresolution is limited in scope.\n\nThe phrase \u201cany disagreements . . . with respect to the calculation of the Earnout\nAmount\u201d could be read either (a) \u201cto encompass only accounting practices and procedures\naffecting earn-out calculations\u201d or (b) \u201cto cover related matters\u201d that might impact earn-out\ncalculations, such as allegations of \u201coperational misconduct and unreasonable business practices\nto alter the revenue calculations and defeat a higher earn-out payment.\u201d USG Cos. v. Advantage\nSales & Mktg. LLC, 2018 WL 3117545, at *8 (D. Del. June 25, 2018). Other aspects of the APA\nsupport the interpretation of this phrase limiting the LAF\u2019s role to resolving accounting disputes.\nThe APA states that the IAF\u2019s role is to resolve the \u201cRemaining Disputed Items\u201d that persist after\nboth parties attempt to reach agreement on the Earnout Amount. (APA at \u00a7 3.2(e)). The APA\nspecifically refers to \u201cCalculations of\u201d the Remaining Disputed Items. (/d.). The fact that these\nRemaining Disputed Items are resolved by means of calculation suggests that JAF\u2019s role was\nspecifically to resolve factual disputes regarding accounting practices and procedures, not legal\ndisputes or non-accounting disputes.\n\nThe Magistrate Judge found that the lack of reference to procedural rules \u201csuggests that\nthe agreement was simply allowing for an expert determination,\u201d not for arbitration. (D.I. 111 at\n25). Plaintiff objects that \u201cthe absence of any procedural rules or guidance in an agreement does\nnot at all signify that the proceeding is not a valid arbitration\u201d because arbitration is a \u201cmore\ninformal dispute resolution process.\u201d (D.I. 112 at 9). Plaintiff's objection is contrary to Delaware\nlaw. Delaware courts recognize that lack of procedural language suggests that the parties did not\nclearly intend to arbitrate. See Ray Beyond, 2019 WL 366614, at 7* (\u201cArbitration provisions\ntypically include procedural rules affording each party the opportunity to present its case; indeed,\n\nthis is viewed as a defining characteristic of arbitration provisions.\u201d (internal citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted)). Even though the absence of procedural rules is not dispositive, it\nnevertheless weighs against a finding of a clear intent to arbitrate.\n\nThe other language in the agreement fails to indicate a clear intent to arbitrate. The APA\nstates, \u201cEach of the [E3 Rivers] and [Plaintiff] agrees that it shall be bound by the [IAF]\u2019s\ndetermination[.]\u201d (APA at \u00a7 3.2(e)). The Magistrate Judge found that, under Delaware law,\nlanguage indicating parties will be \u201cbound\u201d is \u201carbitration-style language,\u201d supporting Plaintiffs\nposition that the IAF\u2019s role would be that of an arbitrator. (D.I. 111 at 23). In response,\nDefendants claim that language of being \u201cbound\u201d by a decision does not itself support a finding\nthat the parties intended to arbitrate. (D.I. 117 at 6-7). The Court agrees with Defendants that\nbare use of \u201cbinding\u201d language is not indicative of arbitration. In Viacom International, Inc. v.\nWinshall, the court held that language pertaining to \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cmanifest error,\u201d not language\npertaining to \u201cbinding\u201d decisions or being \u201cbound,\u201d was arbitration-like because it matched the\nlanguage of the Federal Arbitration Act. 2012 WL 3249620, at *3 (Del. Ch. Aug. 9, 2012).\nStatements that parties would be unable to appeal a \u201cfinal determination\u201d of the expert \u201cin the\nabsence of fraud or manifest error\u201d have subsequently been held to be \u201carbitration-style\u201d\nlanguage. Penton Bus. Media Holdings, LLC v. Informa PLC, 252 A.3d 445, 460 (Del. Ch.\n2018). These cases are primarily focused on the finality of the decision, not its bindingness. See\nViacom, 2012 WL 3249620, at *3. Even though the phrase \u201cfinal and binding\u201d is indicative of\narbitration, see Sapp, 2020 WL 2813176, at *3, the word \u201cbinding\u201d or \u201cbound\u201d alone is not\nnecessarily indicative of arbitration. See NYC Bar Comm. on Int\u2019! Com. Arbitration, supra at 2,\n4 (both expert determination and arbitration can \u201clead[] to a binding result\u201d). For these reasons,\nthe APA\u2019s statement that the parties \u201cshall be bound\u201d by the IAF\u2019s determination does not\n\nsupport a finding of a clear intent to arbitrate.\n\nPlaintiff objects that the Magistrate Judge erred in failing to adequately consider this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Sapp. (D.I. 112 at 6 n.11). Plaintiff asserts that Sapp is factually \u201ceffectively\nidentical\u201d to the present case with respect to the IAF\u2019s duties. (D.I. 112 at 6 n.11). But the scope\nof the duties of the IAF in Sapp turned on idiosyncratic features of the agreement in dispute\nthere. See Sapp, 2020 WL 2813176, at *3 (finding broader duties for the IAF in dispute\nresolution in part because the phrase \u201cnotice of disagreement\u201d was not capitalized in the key\nprovision). Unlike the APA here, the agreement in Sapp also references a \u201cfinal and binding\u201d\ndecision indicative of arbitration. Jd. at *3, These differences are consequential because whether\nthere was a valid agreement to arbitrate in Sapp was concededly a \u201cclose call.\u201d Id. Moreover, in a\nsubsequent Delaware case, Stone v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC, an IAF was to review \u201cDisputed\nItems\u201d regarding \u201cany item set forth\u201d in a statement presenting the calculation of a \u201cFinal\nClosing Payment.\u201d 2020 WL 4037337, at *2 (Del. Ch. July 6, 2020). The IAF was to issue a\n\u201cfinal written determination\u201d as to the value of those items that would \u201cbe binding on the Sellers\u2019\nRepresentative, each Seller and Buyer, as if a final, non-appealable arbitral decision or award.\u201d\nId. The Stone court found it \u201csafe to conclude\u201d that the IAF was \u201cintended to serve as an expert,\nnot an arbitrator.\u201d 2020 WL 4037337, at *8. Here, the APA describes the IAF\u2019s duties with\nsimilar \u201cbinding\u201d language regarding resolution of \u201cany item\u201d pertaining to an accounting value.\nFactually parallel Delaware caselaw thus supports rejecting Plaintiffs contention.\n\nFor these reasons, the Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding that there was no clear intent by the\nparties to arbitrate the Earnout Amount dispute was not clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, Plaintiff's objections (D.L. 112) are OVERRULED. The\n\nMagistrate\u2019s Order (D.I. 111) is AFFIRMED.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED this {ft day of July 2022.\n\nlab f Gadi.\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\n10\n"}
