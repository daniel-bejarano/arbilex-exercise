WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nPlaintiff Persawvere , Inc. (\"Persawvere\") alleges that Defendant Milwaukee Electric Tool \nCorporation (\"Milwaukee\") infringes United States Patent No. 8,607,681 (\"the '681 patent\"). D.I \n1 at ,r 1.1 The '681 patent claims a band saw designed for one-handed operation, which allegedly \novercomes many of the disadvantages of traditional band saws operated with two hands. See \ngenerally '681 patent. \nBefore the Court is the issue of claim construction of multiple terms in the '681 patent. \nThe Court has considered the parties' joint claim construction brief and the accompanying \nappendix. D.I. 47; D.I. 48. The Court held a Markman hearing on February 3, 2023 (the \n\"Markman,\" Tr._). D.I. 77. \nI. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v. \nSumitomo Elec. US.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"A claim in a patent provides \nthe metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling the protected invention \"). \"[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for \nconducting claim construction.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the \nappropriate weight to appropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent \nlaw.\" Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question oflaw, although \n1 The Court writes for the benefit of the parties and assumes their familiarity with this action. \n2 subsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct. \n831, 837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 372 (1996)). \n\"The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as \nunderstood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and \nprosecution history.\" Thorner v. Sony Comput. Ent. Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. \n2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art \"is deemed to \nread the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term \nappears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at \n1313. \n\"When construing claim terms, the court first looks to, and primarily rely on, the intrinsic \nevidence, including the claims themselves , the specification, and the prosecution history of the \npatent, which is usually dispositive.\" Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d \n1271, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \"Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted , \ncan ... be valuable\" in discerning the meaning of a disputed claim term because \"claim terms are \nnormally used consistently throughout the patent,\" and so, \"the usage of a term in one claim can \noften illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In \naddition, \"[d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide[.]\" Id. For example, \"the \npresence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the \nlimitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id. at 1314-15. \nIn addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification, which \"is always highly \nrelevant to the claim construction analysis ... [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a \ndisputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is \nalso possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the \n3 patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's \nlexicography governs.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \"Even when the specification describes only \na single embodiment , [however ,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the \npatentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of \nmanifest exclusion or restriction. \" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 \n(Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Liebel-Flar sheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., \n358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification \"is not a substitute for, nor can it be \nused to rewrite, the chosen claim language. \" SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d \n870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \nThe Court \"should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence. \" \nMarkman, 52 F.3d at 980. The prosecution history \"can often inform the meaning of the claim \nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor \nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution[.]\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. \nIn some cases, the Court \"will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \"consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Markman , 52 F.3d \nat 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \"less significant than the intrinsic \nrecord in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language .\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n4 II. AGREED-UPON TERMS \nThe parties agreed upon the construction of one claim term. \"Axis\" in claims 1 and 7 of \nthe '681 patent means \"a straight line through the center of the wheel about which the wheel \nrotates.\" DJ. 47 at 8. The Court will adopt the agreed-upon construction. \nIII. DISPUTED TERMS \nA. \"handle assembly\" \nThe claim term \"handle assembly\" appears in claims 1 and 7 of the '681 patent. The \nparties' competing proposed constructions for \"handle assembly\" are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term Persawvere's Construction Milwaukee's Construction \n\"the only one part of the hand-held \n\"handle assembly\" Plain and ordinary meaning band saw that is intended for \ngripping during operation \" \nThe parties' dispute revolves around whether the scope of the term \"handle assembly\" was \nlimited to the only portion of the saw that is able to be gripped during the prosecution of the '681 \npatent. Persawvere argues that \"handle assembly\" should be afforded its plain and ordinary \nmeaning, see D.I. 47 at 11, and clarified during the Markman hearing that the term's plain and \nordinary meaning is \"an assembly of component s that form the handle and is attached to the \nframe.\" Tr. at 6. Milwaukee contends that the term should be construed in light of Persawvere ' s \npurported prosecution disclaimer , citing to two instances during prosecution of the '681 patent \nwhere Persawvere allegedly limited \"handle assembly\" to the only portion of the saw that can be \ngripped. Id. at 11, 13-16. \n\"It is axiomatic that we will not narrow a claim term beyond its plain and ordinary meaning \nunless there is support for the limitation in the words of the claim, the specification , or the \nprosecution history.\" 3M Innovative Props. Co. v. Tredegar Corp., 725 F.3d 1315, 1333 (Fed. \n5 Cir. 2013) ( citations omitted). \"Under the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer, a patentee may limit \nthe meaning of a claim term by making a clear and unmistakable disavowal of scope during \nprosecution.\" Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Endo Pharms. Inc., 438 F.3d 1123, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2006). \nProsecution disclaimer can arise from both claim amendments and arguments made to the United \nStates Patent and Trademark Office. Biogen Idec, Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC, 713 F.3d 1090, \n1095 (Fed. Cir. 2013). However , courts will not apply the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer \nunless the disclaimer is \"both clear and unmistakable to one of ordinary skill in the art.\" Elbex \nVideo, Ltd v. Sensormatic Elecs. Corp., 508 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quotations \nomitted). That is, \"[w]here the alleged disavowal is ambiguous , or even 'amenable to multiple \nreasonable interpretations,' [courts] have declines to find prosecution disclaimer .\" Avid Tech., Inc. \nv. Harmonic , Inc., 812 F.3d 1040, 1045 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting Cordis Corp. v. Medtronic AVE, \nInc., 339 F.3d 1352, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). \nDuring the prosecution of the '681 patent, the Examiner rejected independent claim 1, \nwhich recited \"a handle assembly extending from said frame assembly and oriented at an acute \nangle relative to said frame assembly ,\" see D.I. 48, Ex. 12 at 2, as obvious in view of United States \nPatent No. 6,829,830 (\"O'Banion\"). See id, Ex. 15 at 3. The Examiner explained that \"O'Banion \ndiscloses the invention as claimed including ... a handle 14 having a grip portion extending at \nangle with respect to the frame ( see Fig. 2, the horizontal portion of the handle 14) ... \" Id In \nresponse, the applicant amended claim 1 to recite \"a handle assembly extending from said frame \nassembly intermediate said drive wheel and said driven wheel and oriented at an acute angle \nrelative to the plane of the frame assembly, \" and remarked: \nWith respect to the O'Banion reference , Applicant notes that the O'Banion handle \n14 has an 'L' configuration, the grip portion of the handle is actually the vertical \nportion including the trigger, and that the horizontal portion of the handle was never \nintended for gripping and clearly does not satisfy the requirement of claim 1 of a \n6 handle assembly extending from the frame assembly intermediate the drive wheel \nand the drive wheel and orientated at an acute angle relative to the plane of the \nframe assembly. In fact, the horizontal portion of the handle as seen in Fig. 3, is \napparently fixedly secured to the top of the motor 16 in the region opposite the \nthroat of the frame and as such would be impossible to grip. \nId., Ex. 12 at 8. When the Examiner later rejected a different independent claim-which recited \n\"a handle assembly extending angularly outward from the frame and defining a hand grip portion \nhaving a finger trigger, at least a portion of the handle is positioned laterally across from a throat \nopening ... at least a portion of the handle grip portion is positioned longitudinall y between the \nbattery and the motor,\" see D.I. 48, Ex. 19 at 5-as obvious in view of United States Patent No. \n4,823,666 (\"Galloway \"), Applicant distinguished Galloway as failing to disclose: \n[T]he claimed battery position orientation and function with respect to the handle \n( or in the broader saw ... the claimed handle position, orientation and function with \nrespect to the saw frame, throat and battery .... [and] the handle portion as claimed \npositioned laterally across from the throat opening ( as claimed) with a grip portion \npositioned between the battery and the motor. \nId. at 11. \nThe Court disagrees that Persawvere expressly limited the scope of \"handle assembly\" to \n\"the only portion of the saw that can be gripped during operation \" by prosecution disclaimer. In \ndistinguishing O 'Banion, Persawvere did not \"expressly link[] 'intended for gripping' to 'handle \nassembly\"' based on the horizontal portion of O'Banion's handle, see D.I. 47 at 21, but rather it \ndistinguished O 'Banion based on the positioning of the handle assembly. D.I. 48, Ex. 12 at 8 \n(\"[T]he O'Banion handle ... clearly does not satisfy the requirement of claim 1 of a handle \nassembly extending from the frame assembly intermediate the drive wheel and the driven wheel \nand oriented at an acute angle relative to the plane of the frame assembly. \"). That Persawvere \namended claim 1, in light of O 'Bani on, to explicitly recite the positioning of the handle assembly, \ni.e., \"intermediate said drive wheel and said driven wheel ,\" confirms that Persawvere distinguished \n7 O'Banion from the claimed saw based on the positioning of the handle assembly. Id., Ex. 12 at 2. \nSimilarly, Persawvere's statements distinguishing Galloway were directed to the positioning of \nGalloway's two handles, see id., Ex. 19 at 9 (\"Galloway 's two handles and handgrip portions ... \nare not positioned across from the throat ... \"), and nothing in the record suggests, let alone clearly \nand unmistakably, that Persawvere equated \"handle assembly\" to only include the portion that is \ngripped during operation. In fact, the Examiner appeared to understand that \"handle assembly \" \nwas distinct from the hand grip portion, explaining that Galloway separately discloses \"a handle \ndefining a grip portion (see modified Fig. 2) and positioned in lateral alignment with the throat,\" \n\"a handle assembly at an acute angle (see Fig. 1),\" and \"a D-shaped handle (see Fig. 2).\" Id., Ex. \n18 at 2. \nFinding no evidence of a clear and unmistakable statement limiting \"handle assembly\" to \n\"the only portion of the saw that can be gripped during operation ,\" the Court declines to apply the \ndoctrine of prosecution disclaimer . See Elbex Video, Ltd., 508 F .3d at 13 71. Instead, because a \nterm's plain and ordinary meaning is the default in claim construction, Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316, \nthe Court adopts the plain and ordinary meaning of\"handle assembly. \" The specification discloses \nthat the handle assembly includes a variable speed trigger, see '681 patent at 5:24-32, a safety \nswitch, id., and a slide receiver for receiving batteries, id. at 5 :41-46. See also id. at Fig. A. \nNotably, Milwaukee acknowledges2 that the specification provides ample detail so that a person \nof ordinary skill would readily understand the plain and ordinary meaning of \"handle assembly ,\" \n2 Milwaukee's argument that \"even in the absence of a clear and unmistakable disavowal ... the \nprosecution history can be evaluated to determine how a person of ordinary skill would understand \na given claim term,\" see D.I. 47 at 20-21 (quoting Aptalis Pharmatech, Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 718 F. \nApp'x 965, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2018)), is belied by its own admission that \"in describing the handle \nassembly, the specification refers to more than just a single handle that is gripped during \noperation.\" D.I. 47 at 12. \n8 see D.I. 47 at 12 (Milwaukee explaining that the specification depicts the \"handle assembly \" in \nmultiple figures of the '681 patent and explains its relationship to the other claimed components)-\u00ad\nalthough Milwaukee contends, albeit unpersuasively , that the plain and ordinary meaning is \novercome by Persawvere ' s prosecution disclaimer. 3 Id. at 13. Thus, based on the intrinsic record, \nit is clear that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the plain and ordinary meaning \nof\"handle assembly\" to be \"an assembly that may be grasped by hand.\" E.g., '681 patent at claim \n1 ( claiming \"said handle assembly including at least a part of a hand grip portion ... \") ( emphases \nadded); see also Tr. at 24 (Persawvere agreeing that \"an assembly that may be grasped by hand\" \nis a proper construction of \"handle assembly\"). \nAccordingly , Milwaukee has failed to produce \"clear and convincing evidence\" that \nPersawvere limited the scope of \"handle assembly\" to \"the only portion of the saw that can be \ngripped during operation \" by prosecution disclaimer . As such, based on the intrinsic record, the \nCourt construes \"handle assembly \" to have its plain and ordinary meaning-\"an assembly that \nmay be grasped by hand.\" \nB. \"hand grip portion\" \nThe claim term \"hand grip portion\" appears in claims 1 and 7 of the '681 patent. The \nparties' competing proposed constructions for \"hand grip portion\" are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term Persawvere's Construction Milwaukee's Construction \nPlain and ordinary meaning, \"the part of the portable hand-held which means \"a portion of the \"hand grip portion\" saw capable of being gripped saw that the user holds onto during \nby the operator during use\" operation \" \n3 In other words, Milwaukee argues that, but-for Persawvere 's purported prosecution disclaimer , \nthe specification of the '681 patent clearly informs a person of ordinary skill as to the plain and \nordinary meaning of \"handle assembly.\" D.I. 47 at 13. \n9 The crux of the parties' dispute is what is the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \"hand \ngrip portion.\" Persawvere asserts that \"both the specification and common sense\" inform a person \nof ordinary skill in the art as to the plain and ordinary meaning of the disputed term and, thus, the \nCourt need not clarify its meaning or offer any further construction. D.I. 47 at 22, 24. Although \nMilwaukee concedes that \"[Persawvere 's] position is very similar to [Milwaukee 's] construction ,\" \nMilwaukee urges the Court to clarify the plain and ordinary meaning of \"hand grip portion\" \nbecause it does not appear in the specification and a construction will \"set proper boundaries as to \nclaim scope\" for the jury. Id. at 24-25. In response, Persawvere maintains that although both a \nperson of ordinary skill in the art and a juror would \"easily understand the meaning of 'hand grip \nportion,\"' for purposes of clarification , Persawvere proffers that the plain and ordinary meaning is \n\"a portion of the saw capable of being gripped by the operator during use.\" Id. at 25, 25 n.11. \nHowever, Persawvere changed its tune at the Markman hearing, proposing a new plain and \nordinary meaning as \"the grip portion of the handle assembly that contains the trigger assembly.\" \nTr. at 29. While the parties agree that the term's plain and ordinary meaning shall apply, a dispute \nstill exists as to the proper scope of \"hand grip portion\" which requires the Court to construe the \nterm. See 02 Micro Int'! Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., 521 F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed. Cir. \n2008). \nThe Court begins its analysis with the language of the claim itself. The use of the disputed \nterm in claim 1 of the '681 patent is representati ve. \n1. A portable hand-held band saw capable of being fully supported and operated \nsingle-handedly for performing a one-handed cutting operation using a closed \nloop saw blade, comprising : \na handle assembly extending upwardly and outwardly at an angle from the \nplane of the frame, said handle assembly including at least a part of a hand \ngrip portion located between the first axis of the drive wheel and the second \naxis of the driven wheel; .... a trigger within the hand grip portion, said trigger capable of being activated \nby the operator while operating the saw single-handedly , and wherein the \ntrigger is also located between the first drive wheel axis and the second wheel \naxis. \nSee '681 patent at claim 1 (emphases added). \nThe language of the claim suggests, and the parties agree, that a \"hand grip portion\" is a \nportion of the saw that the user grips during operation. D.I. 47 at 24, 25. The specification supports \nthis common sense understanding that a \"hand grip portion\" is what the user grasps during \noperation of the claimed saw. See, e.g., '681 patent at 4:21-23 (stating that \"[t]he handle assembly \n14 includes a pistol grip 42 having a trigger assembly 44 for controlling the cutting speed of the \nmotor 26\"); id. at 7:35-40 (describing the user being able to \"grasp the saw in one hand and position \nor stabilize the stock with the other hand\"); id. at 7:60-8:5 (describing the use of the saw by \ngrasping the handle in one hand and activating the trigger). While the parties proffer nearly \nidentical interpretations of the disputed term based on this intrinsic evidence, Persawvere accuses \nMilwaukee's construction of improperl y importing a process limitation into a product claim. D.I. \n47 at 23, 25. Yet in the same breath, Persawvere proposes a plain and ordinary meaning that \nsuffers from the same issue. Id. at 25 n.11. Nevertheless , the Court disagrees that clarifying that \na \"user/operator\" \"holds/grips\" a \"hand grip portion\" of the saw improperly imports a process \nlimitation into a product claim. See Vanguard Prods. Corp. v. Parker Hannifin Corp., 234 F.3d \n1370, 1372-73 (Fed. Cir. 2000). \nAdditionally, the Court declines Milwaukee 's invitation to limit its construction to \"the\"\u00ad\nas opposed to \"a\"-portion of the saw that is gripped/held onto. Doing so would conflict with the \nclaim language, which uses the indefinite article \"a\" to suggest that the claimed invention is not \nlimited to only one \"hand grip portion.\" See '681 patent at claim 1; see also United Therapeutics \n11 Corp. v. Liquidia Techs., Inc., 2022 WL 3910252, at *16 (D. Del. Aug. 31, 2022) (\"The Federal \nCircuit 'has repeatedly emphasized that an indefinite article 'a' or 'an' in patent parlance carries \nthe meaning of 'one or more' in open-ended claims containing the transitional phrase \n'comprising.\"' (quoting KCJ Corp. v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 223 F.3d 1351, 1356 (Fed. Cir. \n2000))). More so, it would render dependent claims 6 and 13, which separately recite that \"the \nhandle assembly provides the only hand grip portion useable during operation of the saw,\" \nsuperfluous. Promos Techs., Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 809 F. App'x 825, 834 (Fed. Cir. 2020) \n(\"[I]t is generally improper to construe a patent claim so that express claim limitations or elements \nare rendered superfluous .\"). Finally, as to Persawvere 's new construction proffered at the \nMarkman hearing, see Tr. at 29 which is undisputedly different from the plain and ordinary \nmeaning proposed in its briefing, the Court considers this new construction waived. See \nCoolTVNetwork.com, Inc. v. Blackboard Inc., No. 19-291-LPS-JLH, 2020 WL 6536960, at *5 (D. \nDel. Nov. 6, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 WL 2010579 (D. Del. May 20, \n2021) (\"New arguments made at a Markman hearing are waived.\"). But even if the Court were to \nconsider this new construction, i.e., \"the grip portion of the handle assembly that contains the \ntrigger assembly,\" it undoubtedly renders the separately recited \"trigger\" limitation in claim 1 \nredundant. See, e.g., '681 patent at claim 1 (separately reciting \"a trigger within the hand grip \nportion, said trigger capable of being activated by the operator while operating the saw single\u00ad\nhandedly ... \");Tr.at 32 (Persawvere agreeing that its newly proposed construction might render \nthe claim language redundant); see also Promos Techs., 809 F. App'x at 834. \n\u00b7 Therefore, based on the '681 patent's claim language and specification, the Court adopts \nthe plain and ordinary meaning of the term \"hand grip portion,\" which means \"a portion of the saw \ncapable of being gripped by the operator during use.\" \n12 C. The \"Between Terms\"4 \nClaim Term Persawvere's Construction Milwaukee's Construction \n\"hand grip portion \nlocated between the \nfirst axis of the drive Plain and ordinary meaning Indefinite wheel and the second \naxis of the driven \nwheel\" \n\"wherein the trigger is \nalso located between \nthe first drive wheel \naxis and the second \nwheel axis\" / \"trigger Plain and ordinary meaning Indefinite \nbeing positioned \nbetween the first and \nsecond rotational axes \nof the wheels\" \nAs clarified during the Markman hearing, see Tr. at 3 7, the crux of the parties' dispute is \nwhether the Between Terms are indefinite5 or, whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would \nunderstand, with reasonable certainty, how to assess whether the hand grip portion and the trigger \nare \"between\" the axes of the drive and driven wheels. Milwaukee asserts that the Between Terms \n4 The parties combined disputed term 3 (\"hand grip portion located between the first axis of the \ndrive wheel and the second axis of the driven wheel\") and disputed term 4 (\"wherein the trigger is \nalso located between the first drive wheel axis and the second wheel axis\" / \"trigger being \npositioned between the first and second rotational axes of the wheels\") into a single section of the \njoint claim construction brief, see D.I. 47 at 27, and have identified the same dispute for both\u00ad\nwhether the word \"between\" renders these claim terms indefinite. As such, the Court will analyze \nthe terms together and, for the purpose of clarity, refers to disputed terms 3 and 4, collectively, as \nthe \"Between Terms.\" \n5 Persawvere contends that, because Milwaukee \"failed to raise an indefiniteness argument in its \nInvalidity contentions\" concerning the Between Terms, the \"substantially weight balanced\" term, \nsee infra Section III.E, and the distance term, see infra Section III.G, Milwaukee has waived any \nindefiniteness argument. See D.I. 47 at 30, 55-56, 75. However, Milwaukee disclosed in the Joint \nClaim Construction Chart, see generally D.I. 32, D.I. 46, that it would pursue indefiniteness \narguments against the '681 patent. Therefore, Milwaukee did not waive its indefiniteness \narguments. See TQ Delta, LLC v. 2Wire, Inc., 373 F. Supp. 3d 509, 523 (D. Del. 2019). \n13 are indefinite and, thus, declines to proffer a construction . D.I. 47 at 27 nn. 12 & 13. Persawvere \ndisagrees , arguing that \"[t]he meaning of 'between' does not change based on the 'perspective ' in \nwhich the viewer looks at the saw embodiments in the Figures.\" Id. at 35. Rather, when read in \nlight of the intrinsic evidence, the Between Terms clearly inform, with reasonable certainty, those \nskilled in the art about the scope of the invention. Id. at 35-37. \nSection 112 of the Patent Act requires that the claims of a patent \"particularly point[] out \nand distinctly claim[] the subject matter which the inventor ... regards as the invention. \" 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 112(b). The \"primary purpose of the definiteness requirement\" contained in\u00a7 112(b) \"is \nto ensure that the claims are written in such a way that they give notice to the public of the extent \nof the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, e.g., \ncompetitors of the patent owner, can determine whether or not they infringe.\" All Dental Prodx, \nLLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779-80 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \n\"A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification \ndelineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those \nskilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\" Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments , Inc., 572 \nU.S. 898,901 (2014). To determine indefiniteness , courts examine \"the patent record-the claims, \nspecification , and prosecution history-to ascertain if they convey to one of skill in the art with \nreasonable certainty the scope of the invention claimed.\" Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015). While a \"'potential infringer\"' need not \"be able to \ndetermine ex ante if a particular act infringes the claims,\" the patentee must \"apprise the public 'of \nwhat is still open to them[]'\" such that \"a person of ordinary skill in the art could determine whether \nor not an accused product or method infringes the claim.\" Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude Med. \nSC, Inc., 30 F.4th 1339, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (citations omitted) (internal quotations \n14 omitted). The challenger must \"prov[ e] indefiniteness by clear and convincing evidence.\" BASF \nCorp. v. Johnson Matthey Inc., 875 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \nLike claim construction , definiteness is a question of law, but the Court must sometimes \nrender factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the issue of definiteness. See Sonix \nTech. Co. v. Publications Int'l, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \"[A]ny fact critical to \na holding on indefiniteness must be proven by the challenger by clear and convincing evidence.\" \nOne-E-Way , Inc. v. Int'/ Trade Comm'n, 859 F.3d 1059, 1062 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). \nThe disputed Between Terms are not indefinite. While Milwaukee is correct that the '681 \npatent's specification discloses multiple figures illustrating various embodiments of the claimed \nsaw, including multiple different \"perspectives \" of the claimed invention, this alone does not prove \nthat a person of ordinary skill in the art reading the intrinsic record would not be able to determine \nthe meaning of the disputed terms with reasonable certainty. See D.I. 47 at 31-32. In fact, the \nclaim language is clear that the hand grip portion/trigger are located in the area separating the axes \nof the drive and driven wheels: \"at least a part of a hand grip portion located between the first axis \nof the drive wheel and the second axis of the driven wheel,\" and \"wherein the trigger is also located \nbetween the first drive wheel axis and the second wheel axis.\" '681 patent at claim 1 ( emphases \nadded). \nIndeed, the '681 patent's figures confirm that the position of the \"hand grip portion\" or the \n\"trigger\" is in the area separating the axes of the drive and driven wheels, regardless of the \nperspective with which one views the claimed saw. See id. at Figs. 1-9a (the \"hand grip portion\" \nand \"trigger\" are located in the same position \"between\" the two axes in each Figure); Aspex \nEyewear, Inc. v. Marchan Eyewear, Inc., 672 F.3d 1335, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (figures in an \nasserted patent can inform a person of ordinary skill in the art as to the meaning of disputed claim \n15 terms). A person of ordinary skill in the art would also readily understand that the '681 patent's \nfigures are two-dimensional depictions of a three-dimensional saw, and that the area \"between\" \nthe axes of the drive and driven wheels would extend outwards to occupy the three-dimensional \nspace. Thus, even though the \"hand grip portion\" and \"trigger\" are not co-planar to the line created \nby the axes of the drive and driven wheels in every figure of the '681 patent, a person of ordinary \nskill would still understand that the \"hand grip portion\" and \"trigger\" reside in the three\u00ad\ndimensional space \"between\" the two axes. The specification further explains that the one-handed \noperation of the claimed saw is achieved by the location of the handle \"intermediate the drive and \ndrive pulleys 22, 28 respectively , rather than outboard as in previous designs,\" which obviates any \nambiguity as to the meaning of \"between. \" See '681 patent at 4:13-20; see also id at 7:45-59 \n( explaining that the positioning of the handle is an improvement over prior art that includes handles \n\"at an extreme end of the saw body\"). Finally, the '681 patent's prosecution history further \nconfirms that a person of ordinary skill would understand the meaning and scope of the Between \nTerms. When the applicant added the Between Terms, it distinguished prior art references with \nhand grip portions at extreme ends of the claimed saw, explaining that the '681 patent's claimed \n\"hand grip portion is recited as being between the two axes of the drive wheel and the driven \nwheel, which none of the prior art discloses. \" See D.I. 48, Ex. 7 at 4. \nTherefore , when read in light of the entirety of the '618 patent and its prosecution history, \na person of ordinary skill in the art would be clearly informed , with reasonable certainty, that the \nBetween Terms have a definite meaning and scope. In other words, a person of ordinary skill in \nthe art would understand that the Between Terms refer to the area separating the axes of the drive \nand driven wheels, regardless of the perspecti ve with which one views the claimed saw. \nMilwaukee has not carried its burden of demonstrating , by clear and convincing evidence, that the \n16 term is indefinite. Accordingly , the Court, based on the intrinsic record, construes the Between \nTerms to have their plain and ordinary meaning. \nD. The \"One Hand\" terms6 \nClaim Term Persawvere's Construction Milwaukee's Construction \n\"said handle assembly \"the portable hand-held band saw \npermitting the has only one handle assembly and a \noperator to lift ... the Plain and ordinary meaning user is capable of lifting the saw \nsaw with one hand\" with only one hand on this handle \nassembly \" \n\"said handle assembly \"the portable hand-held band saw permitting the has only one handle assembly and a operator to ... operate Plain and ordinary meaning \nthe saw with one user can operate the saw with only \nhand\" one hand on this handle assembly \" \nThe crux of the parties' dispute centers on whether the '681 patent's intrinsic record \nsupports limiting the claims to only one handle assembly that a user can lift/operate with only one \nhand. Milwaukee argues that its proposed construction is correct because \"the specification read \nin light of the prosecution history makes clear that [Persawvere] limited the scope of the claims to \nonly those hand-held band saws having one handle assembly .\" D.I. 47 at 43. Persawvere \ndisagrees , arguing that\"[ n ]othing in the intrinsic evidence suggests that the claimed invention must \nonly have one handle assembly ,\" and refutes any suggestion that it somehow disclaimed band saws \nwith two handles during prosecution. Id at 40-41. For the reasons set out below, the Court finds \nthat Persawvere did not expressly disclaim band saws with two handles and, thus, did not limit the \n6 The parties similarly combined disputed term 5 (\"said handle assembly permitting the operator \nto lift ... the saw with one hand\") and disputed term 6 (\"said handle assembly permitting the \noperator to ... operate the saw with one hand\") into a single section of the joint claim construction \nbrief, and have identified the same dispute for both-whether the '681 patent's specification and \nprosecution history support limiting the claims to only one handle assembly that a user can \nlift/operate with only one hand. As such, the Court will analyze the terms together and, for the \npurpose of clarity, refer to disputed terms 5 and 6, collectively , as the \"One Hand\" terms. \n17 claims to only one handle assembly that the user can lift/operate with only one hand. Therefore , \nthe Court construes the One Hand terms to have their plain and ordinary meaning. \nDuring prosecution of the '681 patent, the Examiner rejected applicant's claims as obvious \nin view of United States Patent No. 2,876,809 (\"Rentsch\") and United States Patent No. 6,442,848 \n(\"Dean\"). See D.I. 48, Ex. 13 at 7. In overcoming this rejection , the applicant explained that \nneither Rentsch or Dean disclosed a band saw that is capable of being operated with one hand \nbecause those references explicitly disclose two-handed use. Id. at 7-8 (\"[N]either cited reference \nteaches or suggests a band saw that the typical user can operate with only one hand.\"). Specificall y, \napplicant noted that Rentsch disclosed \"a saw having two handles ... and teaches that the user \ngrasp both handles when operating the saw,\" while Dean similarly disclosed a saw \"including a \nprimary handle 14 and support handle 16 .... and explicitly [taught] using two hands to operate.\" \nId. \nThe Examiner later rejected applicant 's claims, which did not recite the invention as a one\u00ad\nhanded band saw capable of being operated singlehandedl y, in view of United States Patent No. \nD156282 (\"Schepige\"). D.I. 48, Ex. 11 at 6. In response, the applicant amended independent \nclaim 51 \"to more clearly recite the invention as a one-handed band saw capable of being operated \nsinglehandedly ,\" and explained that: \nSchepige '282 illustrates an ornamental design for a portable band saw that \nnominally includes a trigger portion within a handle, although the Schepige design \nshows a second handle portion, indicating that the Schepige saw is to be used with \ntwo hands. Since there is no other description besides the drawing (as Schepige is \na design patent), looking at the Figures in his patent indicates a two handed \noperation. This is in direct contradistinction over the presently claimed invention , \nwhere it is currently reciting a single handed capability and usage. \nId. at 6-7. Subsequently , the Examiner issued a Notice of Allowance , explaining that: \nThe combination of Schepige with Buck et al. teaches the invention substantiall y \nas claimed regarding the frame and balancing the saw, however, the combination \n18 fails to teach the handle assembly permittin g the operator to lit [sic] and operate the \nsaw with one hand, where the trigger within the hand grip portion is located \nbetween first and second drive wheels. \nD.I. 48, Ex. 6 at 2. \nThe Court disagrees that Persawvere expressly limited the scope of the One Hand terms to \n\"only one handle assembly that a user can lift/operate with only one hand\" by prosecution \ndisclaimer. In distinguishing Rentsch and Dean, Persawvere did not \"link[] two handles with two\u00ad\nhanded operation, \" see D.I. 47 at 54, but rather it distinguished Rentsch and Dean based on their \nexplicit disclosure of only two-handed operation . See D.I. 48, Ex. 13 at 7-8. The applicant \nspecifically pointed to Rentsch's and Dean's requirement that the saw be used with two hands to \ndifferentiate its claimed saw that \"can be operated with one hand by a typical user.\" Id. Similarly, \nin overcoming Schepige , Persawvere explained that, based solely on the drawings , \"the Schepige \nsaw is to be used with two hands[,]\" which is \"in direct contradistinction over the presently claimed \ninvention , where it is currently reciting a single handed capability and usage.\" D.I. 48, Ex. 11 at \n6-7. That Persawvere was distinguishing Schepige based on two-handed operation-rather than \nsolely based on Schepige having two handles- is clear by its remarks and subsequent claim \namendment , which emphasized \"the invention as a one-handed band saw capable of being operated \nsinglehandedly .\" Id. at 6. Nothing in the prosecution history suggests that Persawvere was clearly \nand unmistakably disclaiming band saws with two handles. \nFinding no evidence of a clear and unmistakable statement limiting the One Hand Terms \nto \"only one handle assembly that a user can lift/operate with only one hand,\" the Court declines \nto apply the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer. See Elbex Video, Ltd., 508 F.3d at 1371. Similarly, \nMilwaukee's assertion that the '681 patent's specification also supports limiting the claims to only \none handle assembly fares no better. See D.I. 47 at 43-44. Milwaukee argues that, because \"the \n19 description of every embodiment of the invention focuses on a saw with only one handle \nassembly ,\" the claims are necessaril y limited to only one handle assembly. Id at 43. However , \nMilwaukee ignores that claims are not typically limited to the embodiments disclosed in the \nspecification , even when just one such embodiment (or type of embodiment) is disclosed . See \nHill-Rom, 755 F.3d at 1373 (\"The absence of an embodiment teaching a wireless receiver does not \nprevent the claimed datalink from being given its plain and ordinary meaning at the relevant \ntime.\"). Similarly , Milwaukee argues that the scope of the claims should be limited to only one \nhandle because the specification emphasizes that the purpose of the invention is to use the saw \nwith one-hand , and \"even refers to this characteristic as the 'most important thing.\"' D.I. 4 7 at 43-\n44 (citing '681 patent at 2:59-62). However , the Federal Circuit has repeatedly rejected limiting \nthe claim scope based on the purpose or essence of the claimed invention. See, e.g., Ormco Corp. \nv. Align Tech., Inc., 498 F.3d 1307, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (\"This court ... has rejected a claim \nconstruction process based on the 'essence' of an invention.\"); Allen Eng 'g Corp. v. Bartell Indus., \nInc., 299 F.3d 1336, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\"It is well settled that there is no legally recognizable \nor protected essential element, gist or heart of the invention in a combination patent.\") (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nAs such, the Court finds no support in the intrinsic record to limit the claimed invention to \n\"only one handle assembly that a user can lift/operate with only one hand.\" While the '681 patent \ntouts the invention's capability of being used with one hand, there is no indication that the claimed \ninvention is limited to only one handle. More so, that the claim language uses the indefinite article \n\"a\" when reciting the \"handle assembly \" suggests that the claimed invention is not limited to only \none \"handle assembly .\" See '681 patent at claim 1; see also United Therapeutics Corp., 2022 WL \n3910252, at *16. Therefore , because a term's plain and ordinary meaning is the default in claim \n20 construction, Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316, the Court adopts the plain and ordinary meaning of the \nOne Hand Terms, which means \"the portable band saw having at least one handle assembly that \nthe operator is capable of lifting and operating the saw with one hand.\" \nE. \"said handle assembly being located such that the saw is substantially weight \nbalanced, so that the saw can be utilized in a singlehanded operation for cutting \nthe workpiece while holding the workpiece with another hand of the operator\" \nThe disputed claim term appears in claims 1 and 7 of the '681 patent. The parties' \ncompeting proposed constructions are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term Persawvere's Construction Milwaukee's Construction \n\"said handle assembly \nbeing located such that Indefinite \nthe saw is \nsubstantially weight Alternatively , \"the handle assembly \nbalanced, so that the must be located such that the \nsaw can be utilized in Plain and ordinary meaning position of the center of gravity of \na singlehanded the saw is in the middle of the frame \noperation for cutting across from the throat and generally \nthe workpiece while in a line passing through the user's \nholding the workpiece hand and forearm when the saw \nwith another hand of blade is in a vertical position\" \nthe operator\" \nLike the Between Terms above, here the parties dispute whether the phrase \"substantially \nweight balanced\" renders the disputed term indefinite. Milwaukee argues that the phrase is \nindefinite because the word \"substantially \" incorporates a term of degree without providing a \ndefined threshold for what qualifies as \"substantially weight balanced.\" D.I. 47 at 57. In other \nwords, a person of ordinary skill in the art reading the entire '681 patent would not understand , \nwith reasonable certainty, how much weight balancing qualifies as \"substantially weight \nbalanced.\" Id Milwaukee contends that neither the specification or the prosecution history \nprovide objective boundaries that render the phrase definite and, to the extent \"substantially weight \nbalanced\" requires that the claimed saw can be used single-handedly , whether the claimed saw can \n21 be used single-handedly is \"entirely subjective. \" Id. at 58-59 (\"When a claim term 'depend[s] \nsolely on the unrestrained, subjective opinion of a particular individual purportedly practicing the \ninvention,' without sufficient guidance in the specification to provide objective direction to one \nskill in the art, the term is indefinite. \" (quoting DDR Holdings , LLC v. Hotels.com , L.P., 773 F.3d \n1245, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2014))). \nBoth parties agree that terms of degree are not inherently indefinite. D.I. 47 at 58, 64; see \nInterval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc., 766 F.3d 1364, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\"[W]e do not hold \ntoday, that terms of degree are inherently indefinite .\"). Rather, \"terms of degree render a claim \nindefinite where the intrinsic evidence ( or extrinsic evidence, where relevant and available) \nprovides insufficient guidance as to any objective boundaries for the claims-including where the \nclaims are 'purely subjective ' such that their scope cannot be determined with reasonable \ncertainty.\" Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude Med. SC, Inc., 30 F.4th 1339, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2022). \nAlthough absolute or mathematical precision is not required, see, e.g., Interval Licensing, 766 F.3d \nat 1370; see Nautilus, 572 U.S. at 910 (\"The definiteness requirement, so understood , mandates \nclarity, while recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable.\"), patent claims with descriptive \nwords or terms of degree must provide objective boundaries for those skilled in the art-based on \nthe intrinsic evidence-to be definite. Niazi Licensing , 30 F.4th at 1348. \nApplying the same framework as detailed above, see supra Section III.C, the Court finds \nthat Milwaukee has not met its burden of demonstrating , by clear and convincing evidence, that \n\"substantially weight balanced\" renders the disputed phrase indefinite. See BASF Corp., 875 F.3d \nat 1365. \"Substantially\" is undoubtedly a term of degree. See Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Applera \nCorp., 599 F.3d 1325, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2010). However , looking to the intrinsic evidence, a person \nof ordinary skill would readily understand that the claimed saw is \"substantially weight balanced\" \n22 based on the positioning and location of other claimed components. Specifically , independent \nclaims 1 and 7 explain that the location of the handle assembly aids in achieving a claimed saw \nthat is \"substantially weight balanced.\" See '681 patent at claims 1, 7. The specification provides \nadditional examples of the position and location of various claimed components of the handle \nassembly to substantially weight balance the claimed saw by orienting the center of gravity below \nthe handle.7 See, e.g., id. at 3:49-56; 4:13-20; 5:32-40; 8:6-16. Further, the specification explains \nthat \"an offset of the mass of the motor assembly by the mass of the battery pack naturally orients \nand balances the saw in an appropriate and ergonomically comfortable position.\" Id. at 7:45-59.8 \nMilwaukee even admits that this portion of the specification describes \"a 'substantially ' weight \nbalanced saw based on the 'location and dimension of the battery pack' designed to 'offset' the \nweight of the cantilevered components (e.g., the motor of the saw).\" D.I. 47 at 59 (citing '681 \npatent at 4:26-29). Though Milwaukee contends that this disclosure neither describes or states the \nconcept of offsetting components , its argument is belied by the specification's explicit teaching \n7 Milwaukee argues that, \"while these disclosures may describe what it means to be 'weight \nbalanced, ' they do not provide any objective boundaries for being 'substantially' weight \nbalanced.\" D.I. 47 at 60 n.24. But Milwaukee conflates the requirement of providing \"objective \nboundaries\" with one requiring \"absolute precision .\" The latter is not required. See Nautilus, 572 \nU.S. at 910. \n8 Contrary to Milwaukee's contention, see D.l. 47 at 59-60, a person of ordinary skill would not \nsimply ignore this passage, or its teaching that offsetting various components can achieve a weight \nbalanced saw, just because the independent claims fail to recite a battery pack. Rather, because \nthe battery pack, which is claimed in dependent claims 4 and 10, is a component of the handle \nassembly, see '681 patent at 2:16-19 (\"a battery pack detachably coupled to an end of the handle \nassembly distant from the motor assembly to provide a balance feel to the user when the saw is \ngrasped by the handle\"), a person of ordinary skill would understand that the battery pack's \nlocation and position would also contribute to whether the claimed saw is \"substantially weight \nbalanced.\" See Enzo, 599 F.3d at 1333-34 (a person of ordinary skill would consider a patent's \ndependent claims when evaluating whether terms in independent claims are indefinite). \n23 that \"an offset of the mass of the motor assembly by the mass of the battery pack naturally orients \nand balances the saw.\" See '681 patent at 7:54-57. \nA person of ordinary skill would also understand that \"substantially weight balanced\" \nshould not be viewed in isolation. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1313. Rather, because \"substantially \nweight balanced\" is modified by the phrase \"so that the saw can be utilized in a single-handed \noperation,\" a person of ordinary skill would recognize that \"substantially weight balanced\" is \nexplicitly tied to the claimed saw's capability of being operated single-handedly. In other words, \na person of ordinary skill understands that a \"substantially weight balanced\" saw is one that \"can \nbe utilized in a single-handed operation ,\" to which the specification provides ample explanation \nas to how one would achieve this by positioning and locating the various components of the handle \nassembly. See, e.g., '681 patent at 3:49-56; 4:13-20; 5:32-40; 7:45-59; 8:6-16. And, contrary to \nMilwaukee's assertion, this does not transform the disputed phrase into one that is purely \nsubjective. D.I. 47 at 58-59. Instead, by positioning and locating the various components of the \nhandle assembly, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the center of gravity\u00ad\nan undisputedly objective measurement-would be located below the handle so that the saw can \nbe used single-handedly. See, e.g., '681 patent at 3:49-56; 5:32-40; 8:6-16. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that \"substantially weight balanced\" does not render the \ndisputed term indefinite. Rather, as informed by the intrinsic record, \"substantially weight \nbalanced\" refers to the location of the center of gravity so that the claimed saw can be used single\u00ad\nhandedly. Milwaukee's alternative construction acknowledges as much, although Milwaukee 's \nconstruction requires that the center of gravity be \"generally in line passing through the user's \nhand and forearm when the saw blade is in a vertical position.\" D.I. 47 at 62. But there is no \nintrinsic support for limiting \"substantially weight balanced\" to the orientation of the center of \n24 gravity vector, i.e., \"generally in line passing through the user's hand and forearm,\" when the saw \nblade is in a vertical position. Accepting this limitation would improperly limit the scope of the \ndisputed term to a single embodiment, i.e., using the saw in a vertical position. See Supercell Oy \nv. GREE, Inc., 2021 WL 4452082, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 29, 2021) (cautioning courts to avoid \nconstruing a term \"on the basis of a single exemplary embodiment\"). As such, based on the \nintrinsic record, the Court construes \"substantially weight balanced\" to have its plain and ordinary \nmeaning-\"the center of gravity is in the middle of the frame across from the throat.\" \nF. \"outwardly\" \nThe claim term \"outwardly \" appears in claims 1 and 7 of the '681 patent. The parties' \ncompeting proposed constructions for \"outwardly \" are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term Persawvere 's Construction Milwaukee's Construction \n\"outwardly\" Plain and ordinary meaning \"away from the frame\" \nPersawvere contends that \"outwardly\" requires no construction because \"a person of \nordinary skill in the art would readily understand its plain and ordinary meaning\" as informed by \nthe intrinsic evidence. D.I. 47 at 70. Milwaukee does not dispute that the term's plain and ordinary \nmeaning should apply, but it insists that a construction is necessary \"to ensure consistency of its \nuse in the claims and that the proper claim scope is ascertained.\" Id. at 72. Based on the intrinsic \nrecord, the Court adopts the plain and ordinary meaning of \"outwardly\" and declines to further \nconstrue the term. \nThe use of the term \"outwardly\" in claim 1 of the '681 patent is representative. \n1. A portable hand-held band saw capable of being fully supported and operated \nsingle-handedly for performing a one-handed cutting operation using a closed \nloop saw blade, comprising: \n25 a handle assembly extending upwardly and outwardly at an angle from the \nplane of the frame, said handle assembly including at least a part of a hand \ngrip portion located between the first axis of the drive wheel and the second \naxis of the driven wheel; .... \nwherein the handle assembly defines yet a third plane that is substantially \nparallel to the second cutting plane of the saw blade, this third handle plane \nbeing positioned outwardly from the second cutting plane; ... \nSee '681 patent at claim 1 ( emphases added). \nWhen viewed in its entirety, the claim language makes clear that \"outwardly \" defines a \nrelative position of the handle assembly in relation to the cutting plane and frame. Contrary to \nMilwaukee 's position advanced during the Markman hearing,9 there is no support for limiting \n\"outwardly\" to the relative position \"from the frame\" because the claims already provide context \nas to the positioning of the component \"outwardly\" from another, e.g., \"at an angle from the plane \nof the frame,\" and \"from the second cutting plane.\" See '681 patent at claim 1; see also Promos \nTechs., 809 F. App'x at 834 (\"[I]t is generally improper to construe a patent claim so that express \nclaim limitations or elements are rendered superfluous .\"). The specification further supports that \n\"outwardly \" is understood to mean a spatial location in relation to other components of the claimed \nsaw, i.e., the frame/cutting plane. See, e.g., '681 patent at 3:42-46 (stating that one form of the \nclaimed band saw includes a \"C-shaped frame assembly 12 depending angularly from a centrally \nlocated handle assembly 14\"); id. at 5:32-35 (stating \"[i]n the preferred embodiment , handle \nassembly 92 is angled relative to deck 62. Most preferably , the plane normal or perpendicular to \ndeck 62 is disposed at an acute angle to a plane substantially parallel to the handle assembly\"). \nFurther, the figures of the '681 patent confirm that \"outwardly \" refers to the positioning of various \n9 While Milwaukee argues that its proposed construction should be adopted to ensure consistenc y \nacross the asserted claims, its proposed construction only muddies what is already clear from the \nclaim language itself. See Mfg. Res. Int'!, Inc. v. Civiq Smartscapes , LLC, No. 17-269-RGA , 2018 \nWL 4627661, at *4 (D. Del. Sept. 27, 2018). \n26 components in relation to the claimed planes. E.g., id. at Figure 7 (illustrating the \"outwardly\" \nposition of the handle assembly relative to the cutting plane and frame). \nMilwaukee does not meaningfull y dispute that \"outwardly\" refers to the relative position \nof two objects, and even concedes that \"[i]n all instances in the specification, the term 'outwardly' \nrefers to one object being further away from the tool frame than the other referenced object.\" D.I. \n47 at 72. In other words, both parties agree that a person of ordinary skill in the art would \nunderstand that \"outwardly \" refers to the relative position of claimed components in relation to the \nclaimed plane. Thus, there is no genuine dispute as to proper scope of the claim term that would \nrequire the Court to further construe the term. See Active Video Networks , Inc. v. Verizon \nCommc'ns, Inc., 694 F.3d 1312, 1325-26 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (finding that the district court did not \nerr in concluding that a term's plain and ordinary meaning applies without offering additional \nconstruction); see also 02 Micro, 521 F.3d at 1360. As such, the Court adopts the plain and \nordinary meaning of the term \"outwardly.\" \nG. \"distance between the handle assembly and the saw blade is greater than the \ndistance between the two planes of the cutting plane defined by the saw blade \nextending across the throat and handle assembly plane\" \nThe disputed claim term appears only in claim 12 of the '681 patent. The parties' \ncompeting proposed constructions are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term Persawvere's Construction Milwaukee's Construction \n\"distance between the \nhandle assembly and \nthe saw blade is \ngreater than the \ndistance between the Plain and ordinary meaning Indefinite \ntwo planes of the \ncutting plane defined \nby the saw blade \nextending across the \n27 throat and handle \nassembly plane\" \nOnce again, the parties dispute whether this term is indefinite. Persawvere contends that \nthe term is not indefinite because, \"[ u ]sing the figures and descriptive text, a person of ordinary \nskill would understand how to calculate the distances between: (1) the handle assembly and the \nsaw blade; and (2) the distance between the handle assembly plane and the saw blade extending \nacross the throat.\" D.I. 47 at 74. Milwaukee disagrees , arguing both that the phrase \"two planes \nof the cutting plane\" is ambiguous and that the claim language is unclear as to where the claimed \ndistances should be measured. Id. at 75-76. \nApplying the same framework as detailed above, see supra Section III.C, the Court finds \nthat Milwaukee has not met is burden of demonstrating , by clear and convincing evidence , that the \ndisputed phrase is indefinite. See BASF Corp., 875 F.3d at 1365. Although Milwaukee contends \nthat the phrase \"two planes of the cutting plane\" is ambiguous , Milwaukee mistakenly isolates that \nphrase from the rest of the claim language . Instead, when reading the whole phrase, it is clear that \n\"two planes of' indicates the patentee's intent to define the boundaries of the planes that are to be \nmeasured. That is, the claim language defines the two planes as: (1) the cutting plane, which is \ndefined by the saw blade extending across the throat, and (2) the handle assembly plane. \nMilwaukee's misreading cannot create ambigui ty where none exists. \nFurther, a person of ordinary skill in the art would readily understand that \"the distance \nbetween the handle assembly and the saw blade\" is necessarily measured from the handle assembly \nto the exposed saw blade that comprises the cutting plane. As the '681 patent's specification \nexplains, \"the angle the fence extends downwardl y from deck 52 is substantially parallel to the \norientation of the blade section traversing the throat and the plane of the handle.\" See '681 patent \nat 7:24-28. Contrary to Milwaukee's suggestion , a person of ordinary skill would not measure the \n28 distance from the handle assembly to the portion of the saw blade that sits within the frame. D.I. \n4 7 at 77. That is because a person of ordinary skill-understanding that the claim requires that the \ndistance between the handle assembly and the saw blade be greater than the distance of the defined \nplanes-would recognize that distance is not greater than the distance between the cutting plane \nand the handle assembly plane. Compare D.I. 47 at 77, Figure 7, with id at Figure F. Thus, a \nperson of ordinary skill would not credit Milwaukee 's interpretation. \nAccordingly , because a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand , with \nreasonable certainty, how to measure the distances as claimed based on the '681 patent's intrinsic \nrecord, the disputed phrase \"distance between the handle assembly and the saw blade is greater \nthan the distance between the two planes of the cutting plane defined by the saw blade extending \nacross the throat and handle assembly plane\" is not indefinite . As Milwaukee has not carried its \nburden of demonstrating , by clear and convincing evidence, that the term is indefinite, the Court \naffords the disputed term its plain and ordinary meaning. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe Court will construe the disputed claim terms as described above. The Court will issue \nan Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n29 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPERSA WVERE, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nMIL WAUKEE ELECTRIC TOOL \nCORPORATION, \nDefendant.
