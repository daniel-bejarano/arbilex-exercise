{"case_name": "Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. v. Smitreski et al", "case_number": "21-1586", "judge": "Judge Stephanos Bibas", "date": "04-28-2022", "ocr_text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nACUITY  BRANDS  LIGHTING,  INC.  \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n TIMOTHY SMITRESKI;  \nDIVERSIFIED NJ, INC.;  \n12C SYNERGY, INC.  \n \nDefendant s. \n No. 1:21-cv-01586-SB \n \n \nAndrew Lynch Cole, C OLE SCHOTZ P.C.,  Wilmington, Delaware; Ivan R.

Schreiner, Lorena E. Ahumada, K LEINBARD LLC, \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania.  \n \nCounsel for Defendant s Diversified NJ, Inc. & 12C Synergy, Inc.  \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \nApril 2 8, 2022  \n \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nParties are bound by the words of their agreements ; they cannot inject new mean-\nings later. Yet Acuity Brands Lighting  tries to do just that. It recognizes that defend-\nants must  litigate in a court they agreed to in a forum -selection clause. And it asks \nme to remand to Delaware\u2019s Chancery Court. But the forum -selection clause does not \nmention  the Chancery Court , so I will not remand  this case there .  \nTimothy Smitreski used to work for  Acuity . Compl., D.I. 1 -1 \u00b6\u00b6 1\u20132. Financed by \nAcuity, he wined and dined  its clients. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 29\u201334. Acuity worried that Smitreski \ncould steal those clients if he left. Id.  \u00b6 43. So it made him sign a noncompete  agree-\nment . Id. \u00b6 43. Smitreski promised not to deal with Acuity client s for two years after \nhe left the company. Id.  \u00b6 49. \nBut Acuity suspects he  broke that promise. It accuses  Smitreski of poaching  its \ncustomers as soon as he left to work for its competitor, Diversified NJ, Inc. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 66\u2013\n77. So Acuity sued both Smitreski and Diversified in Delaware Chancery Court, seek-\ning an injunction against Sm itreski\u2019s overtures and damages to compensate for lost \nbusiness. Id. at 35\u2013 37. With Smitreski\u2019s consent , Diversified immediately removed to \nfederal court. D.I. 1 ; D.I. 1-4.  \nNow Acuity asks me to remand  back to Chancery Court . D.I. 10. It says Smitreski \ncould not have consented to removal because he was bound by a forum -selection \nclause in his noncompete. D.I. 11, at 6 , 10; see D.I 12 -1, at 60; 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1446(b)(2)(A). The forum -selection clause provides that all disputes would be \nbrought either \u201cin the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware or the Delaware 3 Superior Court.\u201d D.I. 12 -1, at 60. By signing that  noncompete, Acuity says, Smitreski \nhad \u201cagreed to go to, and stay in , the forum chosen by [Acuity]. \u201d Foster v. Chesapeake \nIns. Co. , 933 F.2d 1207, 1217 (3d Cir. 1991)  (holding that agreeing to litigate in a \nforum might implicitly waive the right to remove) . \nThere is one problem with Acuity\u2019s argument: Smitreski did not  agree to litigate \nin Dela ware Chancery Court. T he only state court that the forum -selection clause \nmentioned was \u201cthe Delaware Superior Court.\u201d D.I. 12 -1, at 60. The \u201cplain and ordi-\nnary meaning\u201d of \u201cSuperior Court\u201d is \u201cSuperior Court,\u201d not \u201cChancery Court\u201d or \u201cany \nstate court.\u201d Ne w Jersey v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. , 640 F.3d 545, 548 (3d Cir. 2011). \nSo the text  does not mandate remand  to the Chancery Court . \nAcuity responds  that by \u201cSuperior Court \u201d they \u201cintended to \u2026 refer [] to [Delaware \ncourts] more generally.\u201d D.I. 11, at 2 n.1. It says the clause contemplat es suits for \ninjunctive relief . And it stresses that those suits must be brought in Chancery Court. \nSee Del. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 341. \nMaybe. Or maybe not. The parties may have expected requests for injunctions  to \nend up in federal court. D.I. 12 -1, at 60. Or they may have planned to ask Delaware\u2019s \nSupreme Court to appoint a Superior Court judge to sit in equity. Del. Const. art. IV, \n\u00a7 13; see, e.g. , AT&T Wireless Servs., Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co. , 2005 W L 2155695, at *4 \n(Del. Sup. Ct. Aug. 18, 2005)  (noting that a Superior Court judge can sit  as both a \nSuperior and Chancery judge) . Thus, there is no need for me to write \u201cChancery \nCourt\u201d into the clause . 4 Acuity also points out that I should not  determine w hich state court \u2014Superior or \nChancery \u2014would have jurisdiction over this case. D.I. 20, at 6 \u20137. Fair enough. But \nreading the words of a forum -selection clause hardly requires me to opine on Dela-\nware jurisdictional rules. So I need not worry about running into this trap.  \n* * * * * \nBecause the plain text of the forum -selection clause does not force  Smitreski to \nlitigat e in Chancery Court, he could consent to removal  to this Court . So I will not \nremand.  \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nACUITY  BRANDS  LIGHTING,  INC.  \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nTIMOTHY SMITRESKI;  \nDIVERSIFIED NJ, INC.;  \n12C SYNERGY, INC.  \n \nDefendant s. \n No. 1:21-cv-01586-SB \n \n \nORDER  \nI DENY  Plaintiff\u2019s  Motion to Remand  [D.I. 10].  \n \nDated: April  28, 2022 \n                       ____________________________________ \n       UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE  \n"}
