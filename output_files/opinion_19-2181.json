CONNOLLY \nCHIEF DISTRICT JUDGE \nI held a five-day jury trial in this patent infringement case filed by Plaintiff \nSteuben Foods, Inc. against Defendants Shibuya Hoppmann Corp., Shibuya Kogyo \nCo., Ltd., and HP Hood LLC (collectively, Shibuya). The asserted patents are \ndirected to apparatuses and methods for aseptic bottle filling. Steuben asserted five \nclaims at trial: claims 3 and 7 of U.S. Patent No. 6,702,985 (the #985 patent); \nclaims 19 and 22 of U.S. Patent No. 6,536,188 (the #188 patent); and claim 26 of \nU.S. Patent No. 6,209,591 (the #591 patent). The jury found that Shibuya's bottle \nfilling machines infringed all the asserted claims, that the asserted claims were not \ninvalid, and that Steuben was entitled to approximately $3 8 million in damages. \nD.I. 787. \nPending before me is Shibuya's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or, \nAlternatively, for a New Trial (D.I. 795). Shibuya brings the motion pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). It seeks by the motion a judgment of \nnoninfringement of the asserted patents, invalidity of the #591 and #188 patents for \nlack of adequate written description and enablement, and invalidity of the #985 and \n#591 patents for obviousness. It asks in the alternative for a new trial and vacatur \nof the jury's damages award. I. MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW \nA. Legal Standard \n\"If the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made \nunder Rule 50(a), ... the movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a \nmatter of law and may include an alternative or joint request f~r a new trial under \nRule 59.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 50(b). A motion filed under Rule 50(b) \"should be \ngranted only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant \nand giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is \ninsufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.\" Lightning \nLube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993). \nB. Analysis \n1. Noninfringement of the #985 Patent \nAsserted claims 3 and 7 of the #985 patent depend from claim 1, which \nrequires among other things that a \"sterilant [be] intermittently added to [a] \nconduit.\" PTX-112 at claim 1 (19:56-57). Before trial, by stipulation of the \nparties, I construed the term \"intermittently added\" to mean \"[a]dded in a non\u00ad\ncontinuous manner.\" D.I. 529-1 at 2; D.I. 531 at 7. \nIt is undisputed that the accused machines add sterilant to their conduit \ncontinuously. Steuben's expert, Dr. Sharon, expressly \"agree[d] that in the \naccused system, the addition of the sterilant, the atomized sterilant[,] to the conduit \nis continuous.\" Tr. 446:8-11 (Sharon). Steuben nevertheless maintained at trial \n2 that the accused machines infringe the \"intermittently added\" limitation under the \ndoctrine of equivalents. Dr. Sharon explained Steuben's equivalents infringement \ntheory to the jury as follows: \nQ. Okay. So, now you have said that, nevertheless, you \nthink that the machine infringes under the doctrine of \nequivalents; is that right? \nA. Correct. \nQ. And let me see. And ifl understand your point \ncorrectly, your point is that the way you read the patent, \nthe point of the intermittent adding is to ensure that the \nright amount of sterilant is added; right? \nA. That is correct. \nQ. Okay. And so whatever structures in Shibuya's \nmachine allow the right amount of sterilant to be added \nwill be equivalent to whatever structure intermittently \nadds in the patent. Is that fair? \nA. I'd agree with that. \nTr. 446: 12-25 (Sharon). \nAt the close of Steuben's case, Shibuya moved for judgment of \nnoninfringement of the #985 patent as a matter of law. Tr. 621:14-18; see also \nD.I. 780. At Steuben's urging, I reluctantly reserved ruling and let the issue go to \nthejury. Tr. 625:12-19; 1068:14-18. \nIn his closing argument, Steuben's counsel argued: \nYou heard a lot and you may hear it on closing that \nintermittent is not the same as continuous, as if that is the \n3 question you're being asked to answer, but that's not the \nprecise question. \nDr. Sharon was very specific. It's not just adding \nsterilant continuously, it's doing that using flow sensors \nand metering pumps to achieve a very precise amount of \nsterilant that's going into the system, and so that's the \nalleged equivalent. You can do it intermittently or as in \nthe accused machines, you can do something \ncontinuously, but very precisely and [with] control. \nThat's the equivalent that's being talked about here from \nDr. Sharon. \nTr. 1265:20-1266:6 ( emphasis added). The jury found that Shibuya infringed \nclaims 3 and 7 of the #985 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. D.I. 787 at 1. \nShibuya argues, and I agree, that as a matter of law the \"intermittently \nadded\" limitation cannot be met under the doctrine of equivalents by a continuous \naddition of sterilant. This conclusion is required by Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. \nHilton Davis Chem. Co., 520 U.S. 17 (1997), in which a unanimous Supreme \nCourt held: \nEach element contained in a patent claim is deemed \nmaterial to defining the scope of the patented invention, \nand thus the doctrine of equivalents must be applied to \nindividual elements of the claim, not to the invention as a \nwhole. It is important to ensure that the application of \nthe doctrine, even as to an individual element, is not \nallowed such broad play as to effectively eliminate that \nelement in its entirety. \nId. at 29. Here, Steuben's equivalency theory effectively eliminates the \n\"intermittently added\" limitation in its entirety, and therefore a judgment of \n4 noninfringement is warranted as a matter of law. No reasonable juror could \nconclude that adding sterilant continuously is substantially the same as adding \nsterilant intermittently. \n\"Intermittently\" and \"continuously\" are antonyms of each other, not \nequivalents. See Intermittently, Merriam-Webster.com Thesaurus, \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/intermittently (last visited Mar. 6, \n2023). As noted above, at the request of both sides, I construed \"intermittently \nadded\" to mean \"[a]dded in a non-continuous manner.\" D.I. 529-1 at 2; D.I. 531 \nat 7. As a matter of logic and contrary to counsel's statements in his closing \nargument, doing something in a non-continuous manner cannot be achieved by \ndoing it \"continuously\" even if you were doing it \"continuously, but very precisely \nand with control.\" Steuben's doctrine of equivalents theory defies logic, vitiates \nthe \"intermittently added\" limitation of the asserted claims, and therefore cannot be \nsustained as a matter of law. Warner-Jenkinson, 520 U.S. at 29; see also Planet \nBingo, LLC v. GameTech Int'!, Inc., 472 F.3d 1338, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2006) \n(affirming district court's refusal to find infringement by equivalents where \n\"proposed application of the doctrine of equivalents would change 'before' to \n'after\"' and noting that \"[t]his court has refused to apply the doctrine in other cases \nwhere the accused device contained the antithesis of the claimed structure\"); Asyst \nTechs., Inc. v. Emtrak, Inc., 402 F .3d 1188, 1195 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (holding that \n5 \"the district court was correct in ruling that the doctrine of equivalents cannot be \nextended to reach an 'unmounted' system ... without vitiating the 'mounted on' \nlimitation altogether\"); SciMed Life Sys., Inc. v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., \nInc., 242 F.3d 1337, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he doctrine of equivalents cannot \nbe employed in a manner that wholly vitiates a claim limitation. Thus, if a patent \nstates that the claimed device must be 'non-metallic,' the patentee cannot assert the \npatent against a metallic device on the ground that a metallic device is equivalent \nto a non-metallic device.\" (internal citations omitted)); Moore U.S.A., Inc. v. \nStandard Reg. Co., 229 F.3d 1091, 1106 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that patentee's \n\"use of the term 'majority' is not entitled to a scope of equivalents covering a \nminority\" for the independent reason that \"it would defy logic to conclude that a \nminority-the very antithesis of a majority-could be insubstantially different \nfrom a claim limitation requiring a majority, and no reasonable juror could find \notherwise\"). \nSteuben insists that in Epos Technologies, Ltd. v. Pegasus Technologies, \nLtd., 766 F.3d 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2014), \"the Federal Circuit rejected [the idea that \nthere is] a 'binary choice' between the very same terms continuous and \nintermittent.\" D.I. 798 at 14 (emphasis in original). But the construction of those \nterms by the district court in Epos Technologi,es makes that case inapplicable here. \nThe patents at issue in Epos Technologies covered digital pens and receiver \n6 devices; a claim limitation of one of the patents-the #3 71 patent-required a \n\"device for receiving or transmitting an 'intermittent' ultrasound signal.\" 766 F.3d \nat 1347. Based on the undisputed fact that the accused devices \"generate[d] a \ncontinuous ultrasound signal,\" the district court rejected the plaintiff's \n. infringement theory under the doctrine of equivalents and granted summary \njudgment ofnoninfringement. Id. at 1348. The district court \"reasoned that \nallowing continuous ultrasound signals to be equivalents 'would eliminate the \nintermittent limitation entirely,' and that 'the doctrine of equivalents cannot extend \nthat far.\"' Id. (internal citations omitted). The Federal Circuit reversed that \ndecision and remanded the case for further consideration, finding that \"the district \ncourt 'shortcut' the [ doctrine of equivalents] inquiry by identifying a binary choice \n(continuous or intermittent) that is not compelled by the [#]371 patent and the \nrecord evidence.\" Id. \nEpos Technologies is distinguishable from this case because, unlike here, the \ndistrict court in Epos Technologies had not construed the intermittent limitation to \nnecessarily preclude a device that generated a continuous ultrasound signal. \nRather, the district court had construed \"'intermittent' as 'something that occurs \noccasionally, in a non-continuous manner, in a random or unpredictable manner, or \nat selected times.'\" Id. at 1347 (emphasis added). In this case, however, I \nconstrued \"intermittently added\" to mean-and only mean-\"[a]dded in a non-\n7 continuous manner.\" D.I. 529-1 at 2; D.I. 531 at 7. It is, of course, impossible to \nadd something continuously in a non-continuous manner. Thus, unlike in Epos \nTechnologies, in this case there is a binary choice between \"intermittently\" and \n\"continuously.\" \nAccordingly, I will enter judgment of noninfringement of the asserted claims \nof the #985 patent as a matter of law. \n2. Noninfringement of the #188 Patent \nAsserted claim 22 of the # 188 patent depends from asserted claim 19, which \nhas two claim limitations written in means-plus-function form. The first limitation \nrequires a \"means for providing a plurality of bottles,\" PTX-199 at claim 19 \n(16:65); the second requires a \"means for filling the aseptically disinfected \nplurality of bottles at a rate greater than 100 bottles per minute,\" PTX-199 at claim \n19 (17:5-6). \nA claim limitation that recites a function to be performed rather than a \ndefinite structure, is subject to the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, ,r 6 (1994). \nOdetics, Inc. v. Storage Tech. Corp., 185 F.3d 1259, 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Such \nlimitations \"must be construed 'to cover the corresponding structure, material, or \nacts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.\"' Id. at 1266-67 ( citing \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, ,r 6; B. Braun Med., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 124 F.3d 1419, 1424 \n(Fed. Cir. 1997)). \"Literal infringement of a\u00a7 112, ,r 6 limitation requires that the \n8 relevant structure in the accused device perform the identical function recited in \nthe claim and be identical or equivalent to the corresponding structure in the \nspecification.\" Id. (emphasis added). If the relevant structure in the accused \ndevice is not identical to the corresponding structure in the patent's written \ndescription, then the test for \u00a7 112, ,I 6 equivalence is whether the two structures \n\"perform the identical function, in substantially the same way, with substantially \nthe same result.\" Kemco Sales, Inc. v. Control Papers Co., 208 F.3d 1352, 1364 \n(Fed. Cir. 2000). Because \"[f]unctional identity and either structural identity or \nequivalence are both necessary,\" Odetics, 185 F.3d at 1267 (some emphasis \nadded), a court is required \"to give independent meaning to both the 'function' and \n'way' prongs of the equivalency test.\" Applied Med Res. Corp. v. U.S. Surgical \nCorp., 312 F. App'x 326,332 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (emphasis added). \nI construed the corresponding structure for the \"means for providing a \nplurality of bottles\" limitation to be \"a pushing element, and equivalents.\" D.I. 531 \nat 2. I construed the corresponding structure for the \"means for filling the \naseptically disinfected bottles at a rate greater than 100 bottles per minute\" \nlimitation to be, among other things, a conveyor and a conveyor plate and \nequivalents. D.I. 531 at 5-6. \nSteuben alleged at trial that the accused machines have an infeed screw, \nrotary wheels, and neck grippers that are the structural equivalents respectively of a \n9 pushing element, conveyor, and conveyor plate. Tr. 365:3-12, 405:7-10, 409:1-6 \n(Sharon). Shibuya argues that no reasonable juror could conclude based on the \nrecord evidence that the three alleged equivalents operate in substantially the same \nway as their corresponding structures, and therefore a judgment of \nnoninfringement of the # 188 patent is warranted. \nWith respect to the infeed screw, Dr. Sharon testified: \n[T]he way the infeed screw works is that as it rotates, you \ncan see that it pushes the bottles forward along the axis of \nthe screw. Okay. \nSo this thread that is on a screw is actually no different \nthan the thread on a bolt, only that it's bigger, and \nbasically, it, as it's turning, it's kind of wedging the \nbottle and pushing it along. The thread is like a helix. It \nkind of does that as I rotate here, you know, it pushes it \nalong. \n* * * * \n[T]he only way the screw can move the bottles is by \npushing on their side, you know, through the wedging \naction. \nTr. 369:1-370:10 (Sharon). A reasonable juror could conclude from this testimony \nthat the infeed screw operates in substantially the same way as a pushing \nelement-i.e., by pushing. Indeed, a rational juror could conclude from this \ntestimony that an infeed screw is a pushing element. \nI agree with Shibuya, however, that Steuben did not adduce at trial sufficient \nevidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that the way the accused machines' \nrotary wheels and neck grippers operate is substantially the same as the way a \n10 conveyor and conveyor plate operate. Rotary wheels move rotationally, not \nlinearly like a conveyor. Tr. 410:21-411:2, 477:19-22 (Sharon). And rotary \nwheels operate continuously, not intermittently like a conveyor. Tr. 411 :3-8, \n477:15-18 (Sharon). The neck grippers of the accused machines each hold one \nbottle at a time, Tr. 676:6-8 (Larrick), whereas the conveyor plates described in \nthe patent move six or 12 bottles at a time, PTX-199 at Fig. 8; PTX-199 at 7:38-\n47; Tr. 476:16-477:14 (Sharon). Neck grippers pinch the bottles at the neck, \nwhereas a conveyor plate surrounds the bottom of the bottles. Tr. 406:16-25 \n(Sharon). Neck grippers can hold different bottle sizes, Tr. 676:25-677:2 \n(Larrick); Tr. 854:5-10 (Glancey), whereas conveyor plates can accommodate only \nbottles with bases barely smaller than the size of the plates' holes, Tr. 849:24-\n850:3 (Glancey). These differences are undisputed and so substantial that no \nreasonable juror could conclude that the accused machines had the structural \nequivalents of a conveyor and conveyor plate. See Toro Co. v. Deere & Co., 355 \nF.3d 1313, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (affirming grant of summary judgment because \n\"the two systems accomplish [the claimed] function in fundamentally different \nways\"); Chiuminatta Concrete Concepts, Inc. v. Cardinal Indus., Inc., 145 F.3d \n1303, 1309, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (finding no infringement under either\u00a7 112, ,I 6 \n11 or the doctrine of equivalents because the accused device operated in a \n\"substantially different way\"). 1 \nSteuben insists that it adduced at trial sufficient evidence to support the \njury's finding of equivalency of the accused machines' components with the \npatent's corresponding structures. But in the testimony it cites in support of its \nposition, Dr. Sharon merely opined that the neck grippers and rotary wheels were \ninsubstantially different from a conveyor and conveyor plate because they fulfill \nthe claimed function of filling aseptically disinfected bottles at a rate greater than \n100 bottles per minute. See Tr. 406:4-9 (Sharon testifying that the differences \nbetween neck grippers and conveyor plates are \"insubstantial ... because, again, \n... the function of the claim is filling bottles at a rate greater than a hundred bottles \nper minute. How you hold the bottles is not important.\"); Tr. 411 :9-15 (Sharon \ntestifying that the differences between rotary wheels and a conveyor are \n1 Before trial, I had denied Shibuya's motion for summary judgment of \nnoninfringement of the #188 patent based on Steuben's denial of Shibuya's factual \nassertion that the accused machines do not use a linear conveyor. See D.I. 751 \nat 1. In support of its denial of that assertion, Steuben cited record evidence of a \nlinear conveyor. See D.I. 751 at 1. I learned at trial-from Steuben's own \nexpert-that that linear conveyor moves the bottles after they have been sterilized \nby the accused machines to a labeling and packaging station. See Tr. 477:19-\n4 78: 16 (Sharon testifying that the linear conveyor \"is not part of the sterilization\" \nand is \"not part of the filling the bottles.\"). In other words, the linear conveyor \nplate Steuben referred me to in its summary judgment briefing is irrelevant to the \nquestion of infringement. \n12 insubstantial because \"you can use either strategy and still achieve 100 bottles per \nminute. It's not like using one or the other is going to allow you to do that and the \nother one isn't. So it's an insubstantial difference.\"); Tr. 410:15-20 (Sharon \ntestifying that \"if the claim was directed towards novel new ways of transporting \nbottles, then maybe those differences [between rotary wheels and a conveyor] \nwould be substantial, but in terms of filling at a rate of 100 bottles per minute, you \ncan do it with a linear conveyor [or] rotary dial. It's not -it's not a substantial \ndifference.\"). \"Function\" and \"way,\" however, are independent considerations in \ndetermining structural equivalence under\u00a7 112, 16. Odetics, 185 F.3d at 1267; \nApplied Med. Res., 312 F. App'x at 332. And because Steuben adduced no other \nevidence to show that the accused machines' rotary wheels and neck grippers \noperate in substantially the same way as a conveyor and conveyor plate, I will \ngrant judgment of noninfringement of the asserted claims of the # 188 patent as a \nmatter of law. \n3. Noninfringement of the #591 Patent \nSteuben accused Shibuya' s P7 filling machine of infringing claim 26 of the \n#591 patent. Claim 26 covers an apparatus that has, among other things, \"a first \nsterile region surrounding a region where the [ food] product exits the valve\" of a \nfill pipe into a bottle and \"a second sterile region positioned proximate [to] said \nfirst sterile region.\" PTX-212 at reexamined claim 26 (2:59-62). \n13 As the patent explains, the second sterile region solved a contamination \nproblem traceable to the design of existing bottle fillers' valves used to stop and \nstart the flow of sterile food product into the bottles. PTX-212 at 14:1-23. In that \ndesign, illustrated in Figures 23 and 24 of the patent and reproduced below, \"the \nvalve stem 256A may carry contaminants from the non-sterile region 268 into the \nfirst sterile region 260\" as it moves up (into the non-sterile region) to stop and \ndown (into the sterile region containing food product) to start the flow of food \nproduct into the bottles. PTX-212 at 14:18-21. \nNon-Sterile\u00ad\nRegion \n_jQ_ \nFirst Sterile\u00ad\nRegion 258A \nFill pipe 262A-i.-s:s:s:~ ~~I \n(Sterile} \n194A Non-Sterile \nRegion 190A \n256A \n.. .12.. ~ First Stenle-e \nRegion m 258A \n}G4A _ Contamination of \nFirst Sterile Region \n..22.. \n196A \n~ \nFill pipe 2s2Al \n(Sterile} ~~ Valve 194A \nDDTX-3.92 (annotated) . The patent purports to solve this contamination problem \nby adding a \"second sterile region\" into which a sterilant is introduced to clean the \nportion of the valve stem that is exposed to the non-sterile region during the \nvalve's operation. See PTX-212 at 14:21-30. \n14 According to the patent's written description and as illustrated in Figures 25 \nand 26 of the patent, which are reproduced below: \"In the present invention, the \nfirst portion 264A of the valve stem 256A has not introduced contaminants into the \nfirst sterile region 260 because the first portion 264A of the valve stem 256A was \npre-sterilized in the second sterile region 270A before entering the first sterile \nregion 260.\" PTX-212 at 14:49-53. \n190A \n422A \n90 \n166 \n260 258A \n194A 190A \n422A 258A \n194A _ J vc stem \nstcrihZ_Cd \nDDTX-3.96 (annotated). Region 270A (highlighted in purple) is the patent's only \ndepiction of a second sterile region. Tr. 468: 12-469:20 (Sharon). \nAt the Markman hearing, I agreed with Steuben that the \"second sterile \nregion positioned proximate [to] said first sterile region\" limitation (i.e., the \n\"second sterile region\" limitation) did not require a construction and should be \ngiven its plain and ordinary meaning. D.I. 531 at 6; D.I. 755 at 3 (quoting oral \n15 ruling made at Markman hearing). Steuben later moved for summary judgment of \ninfringement of claim 26 by the P7. D.I. 614. Shibuya argued that I should deny \nthe motion because the P7 does not meet the \"second sterile region\" limitation and \nbecause Shibuya's so-called \"reverse doctrine of equivalents\" defense raised a \nfactual dispute. D.I. 707 at 7-12.2 \nThe P7 uses a flexible, impenetrable barrier called a bellows that surrounds \nthe portion of the valve stem that is exposed to a non-sterile region and thereby \nprevents that portion of the valve stem from entering ( and thus from \ncontaminating) the sterile zone (i.e., the first sterile region). Tr. 469:4-17 \n2 Courts, including the Federal Circuit, have used the phrase \"reverse doctrine of \nequivalents\" when a defendant invokes the doctrine of equivalents; and the parties \nused that phrase here to describe Shibuya' s doctrine of equivalents defense. The \nSupreme Court made clear in Graver Tank & Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air \nProducts Co., that the doctrine of equivalents applies equally to plaintiffs and \ndefendants in a patent infringement case: \nThe wholesome realism of th[ e] doctrine [ of equivalents] \nis not always applied in favor of a patentee but is \nsometimes used against him. Thus, where a device is so \nfar changed in principle from a patented article that it \nperforms the same or a similar function in a substantially \ndifferent way, but nevertheless falls within the literal \nwords of the claim, the doctrine of equivalents may be \nused to restrict the claim and defeat the patentee's action \nfor infringement. \n339 U.S. 605, 608-09 (1950). For ease of reference, I will follow the parties' lead \nand refer to Shibuya' s doctrine of equivalents defense as a reverse doctrine of \nequivalents defense. \n16 (Sharon); Tr. 688:4-689:17 (Larrick); Tr. 905:18-906:14 , 908:2-10 (Glancey) . \nThe following images depict the P7's fill-pipe valve in its closed (left image) and \nopen (right image) positions: \nFill pip('--- Fill pipe---\n-Bellows -Bellows \n{Physic~, {Physical \nbame<) b.lrrier) \nFood product pas~ge - Food product p~s~s\u2022 -\n~~ ~~ \ns1e111e,one - Sterile 1one - \u2022 \nvalw-\nValve-\nDDTX-3.99-100 . \nBecause it was undisputed that the inside of the P7's fill pipe (i.e., the \"Food \nproduct passage\" in the above images) is both sterile and proximate to the P7's \nfirst sterile region (i.e., the \"Sterile zone\" in the above images), I found that the P7 \nmeets the \"second sterile region\" limitation and literally infringes claim 26. \nD.I. 755 at 5. But I denied Steuben's motion for summary judgment because of \nShibuya's invocation of the reverse doctrine of equivalents defense and the fact \nthat Shibuya had adduced on the record an expert's opinion that the P7's fill pipe \n(which carries food and does not carry a sterilant) does not clean the valve stem. \n17 That opinion evidence, I held, gave rise to a fact question-namely, whether the P7 \nperformed the second sterile region's claimed function in a substantially different \nway-and thus precluded summary judgment of infringement. See D.I. 755 at 7. \nAt trial, Steuben maintained its position that the P7 met the \"second sterile \nregion\" limitation solely by virtue of the sterile region inside of the P7' s fill pipe. \nSteuben did not allege that any other area or component of the P7 constitutes a \n\"second sterile region.\" Steuben also did not dispute that the P7' s fill pipe does \nnot clean the valve stem. Thus, not surprisingly, Dr. Sharon conceded during his \ncross-examination that the P7 \"doesn't have a sterile region that cleans the valve \nstem while the machine is in operation.\" Tr. 469: 18-20 (Sharon); see also Tr. \n468:22-469:20 (Sharon). \nAt the close of Steuben's infringement case and again at the conclusion of \nthe presentation of evidence, Shibuya moved for judgment of noninfringement of \nthe #591 patent as a matter of law. Tr. 629:8-17; Tr. 1064:7-12. Shibuya argued \nthat Steuben had \"admitted that what has been called the second sterile region in \nthe accused device ... does not solve the problem ... the patent purports to solve, \nI \nand therefore under the reverse doctrine of equivalents, the accused invention is so \nfar changed in principle that it's just not doing what the patented claim is about.\" \nTr. 629:11-17. Although I stated that this was a \"really, really good argument[],\" I \ndenied the motion and told counsel I would revisit the argument during posttrial \n18 motion practice. Tr. 629: 18-22. In retrospect, I should have granted the motion, \nas no reasonable juror could have concluded that Steuben rebutted Shibuya's prima \nfacie showing of noninfringement under the reverse doctrine of equivalents. \n\"When a patentee establishes literal infringement, the accused infringer may \nundertake the burden of going forward to establish the fact of non-infringement \nunder the reverse doctrine of equivalents. If the accused infringer makes a prima \nfacie case, the patentee, who retains the burden of persuasion on infringement, \nmust rebut that primafacie case.\" SRI Int'/ v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of Am., 775 \nF.2d 1107, 1123-24 (Fed. Cir. 1985). \nTo make a prima facie showing of noninfringement under the reverse \ndoctrine of equivalents, the defendant must adduce evidence from which a rational \njuror could conclude that the accused \"device is so far changed in principle from \n[the] patented article that it performs the same or a similar function in a \nsubstantially different way.\" Graver Tank, 339 U.S. at 608-09; see also Autogiro \nCo. of Am. v. United States, 384 F.2d 391, 399--400 (Ct. Cl. 1967) (\"[S]ince the \nlaw is to benefit the inventor's genius and not the scrivener's talents, claims must \nnot only read literally on the accused structures, but also the structures must 'do the \nsame work, in substantially the same way, and accomplish substantially the same \nresult.'\" (internal citation omitted)). Shibuya easily met this burden of production \nat trial. Its expert, Dr. Glancey, testified: (1) consistent with the patent's \n19 specification, that the principle of operation of the second sterile region in the \nclaimed invention is to \"appl[y] a sterilant to [the potentially contaminated] portion \nof the valve stem, thus cleaning that part of the valve stem,\" Tr. 905:16-17 \n(Glancey); (2) based on engineering drawings, documents, and a site visit to \nShibuya's facility, Tr. 904:2-7 (Glancey), that the P7's principle of operation is the \nuse of a \"flexible\" bellows that \"stretches or contracts\" and \"provide[ s] an \nimpervious barrier to prevent th[ e] internal contaminants inside the bellows from \nmigrating out and contacting the food\" as the valve stem \"moves up or down,\" Tr. \n906:6-12 (Glancey); (3) that there is therefore \"no need for sterilant\" in the P7's \nfill pipe (i.e., the alleged second sterile region), Tr. 907:16-18 (Glancey); and (4) \nthat these differences between the principles of operation of the claimed invention \nand the P7 are substantial and therefore under the reverse doctrine of equivalents, \nthe P7 does not infringe claim 26, Tr. 908:11-19 (Glancey). \nSteuben argues that it rebutted Dr. Glancey's testimony with Dr. Sharon's \ntestimony. D.I. 798 at 9. Although Dr. Sharon never expressly stated that the \nprinciples of operation of the P7 and of the patented invention are not substantially \ndifferent, he did testify that the P7 \"embod[ies] the principles of operation of claim \n26,\" including \"the principles of operation of the first and second sterile regions.\" \nTr. 361: 17-22 (Sharon). But, according to Dr. Sharon, \"the whole principle of \noperation\" of claim 26 is \"basically filling more than 350 bottles per minute \n20 aseptically and doing that with, by having these two sterile regions that the valve is \nsort of constrained to so that as it opens and closes, it only stays within those two \nregions and it does not go into any non-sterile region and therefore [ reduces the] \nrisk [of] the possibility of bringing in contaminants, pathogens, into the food.\" Tr. \n355:6-13 (Sharon) (emphasis added). This characterization of the patented \ninvention, however, is wrong as a matter of law because it is inconsistent with the \npatent's specification. It therefore was entitled to no weight by the jury. See \nRoche Palo Alto LLC v. Apotex, Inc., 531 F.3d 1372, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2008) \n( affirming grant of summary judgment of infringement and district court's ruling \nthat expert's declaration did not establish prima facie case of reverse doctrine of \nequivalents where declaration was contrary to the patent's claims and specification \nand therefore \"d[id] not properly establish the principle of the [asserted] patent\"); \nVitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\"[T]he \nexpert testimony, which was inconsistent with the specification and file history, \nshould have been accorded no weight.\"). \nThe valve stem in the patented invention does not stay in the two sterile \nregions. On the contrary, the whole purpose of the second sterile region in the \npatented invention is to sterilize the portion of the valve stem that is exposed to a \nnon-sterile region. As the patent's written description explains and Figures 25 and \n26 illustrate, \"[t]he first portion 264A of the valve stem 256A is surrounded by the \n21 second sterile region 270A,\" PTX-212 at 14:40-41, and \"[a] second portion 266A \nof the valve stem lies in the non-sterile region 268\" when the invention's valve is \nin the closed position, PTX-212 at 14:35-36 (emphasis added). To open the \nvalve, an actuator \"displace[s] the valve stem 256A in a downward direction .... \nallowing [food] product 262A to flow into a bottle.\" PTX-212 at 14:44-47. At \nthis point, \"[t]he first portion 264A of the valve stem 256A has entered the first \nsterile region 260,\" PTX-212 at 14:47-49, and \"[t]he second portion 266A of the \nvalve stem 256A has entered the second sterile region 270Afrom the non-sterile \nregion 268,\" PTX-212 at 14:53-55 (emphasis added). The second portion of the \nvalve stem is then \"sterilized in the second sterile region 270A removing any \ncontaminants.\" PTX-212 at 14:56-57. This principle of operation in \"the second \nsterile region 270A removes any contaminants from the valve stem 256A before \nany portion of the valve stem 256A enters the first sterile region.\" PTX-212 at \n14:58-60. When the valve is closed, the actuator displaces the valve stem in an \nupward direction, returning the first portion of the valve stem to the second sterile \nregion and the second portion of the valve stem to the non-sterile region. See \nPTX-212 at 13:63-65; PTX-212 at Fig. 23-26. \nSteuben cites in its posttrial briefing and Dr. Sharon identified at trial \nnothing in claim 26 or the #591 patent's specification that requires, discloses, or \nsuggests in any way that a principle of operation of the claimed invention is (in Dr. \n22 Sharon's words) to \"constrain[]\" the valve \"so that as it opens and closes, it only \nstays within [the first and second sterile] regions and it does not go into any non\u00ad\nsterile region and therefore [ reduces the] risk [ of] the possibility of bringing in \ncontaminants, pathogens, into the food.\" Tr. 355:10-13 (Sharon). At trial, Dr. \nSharon relied solely on the P7 to establish the principle of operation of the patent. \nUsing a valve taken from a P7, design documents for the P7, and demonstrative \nexhibits, Dr. Sharon explained to the jury how the P7 worked, Tr. 356:14-361:3 \n(Sharon), and then offered his opinion that the P7 \"embod[ies] the principles of \noperation of claim 26\" and \"the principles of operation of the first and second \nsterile region[s],\" Tr. 361 :17-22 (Sharon). \nSteuben's position at trial was that it did not have to rely on claim 26 or the \npatent's specification to establish claim 26's or the second sterile region's \nprinciples of operation because I had found that the P7 literally infringed claim 26. \nIt made this point unequivocally in the following exchange between Steuben's \ncounsel and Dr. Sharon: \nQ. So just to be clear, what we were talking about was, \nyou know, how the patent claim works and you're using \n[the P7] as an example? \nA. That is correct. \nQ. Do you think it's fair to use that valve as an example \nof the patent claim? \nA. I do. \n23 Q. Why? \nA. Because the-because the accused machine was \nfound to literally infringe, so, you know, if we know that \nit has that element. \nQ. Thankyou. \nTr. 357:23-358:9 (Sharon). \nBut this approach turns the reverse doctrine of equivalents on its head. The \ndoctrine rescues from infringement devices that literally satisfy the elements of a \nclaim but perform the same function of the invention in a substantially different \nway. It makes no sense, then, to look to the accused device that literally infringes \nto determine how the patented invention performs. But that is what Dr. Sharon did \nhere. He based his description of the patented invention 's principle of operation on \nthe P7 's principle of operation. This logic nullifies the reverse doctrine of \nequivalents. \nBecause Dr. Sharon's testimony about the principles of operation of claim \n26 and the second sterile region was contrary to the patent's specification, it was \nwrong as a matter of law and entitled to no weight at trial. And because Steuben \nadduced no other evidence to rebut Dr. Glancey's testimony, Shibuya is entitled to \na judgment of noninfringement of the #591 patent under the reverse doctrine of \nequivalents as a matter of law. \n24 4. Invalidity of the #188, #591, and #985 Patents \nShibuya also argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law of \ninvalidity of the #591 and # 188 patents for lack of adequate written description and \nenablement and of the #985 and #591 patents for obviousness. But as Steuben \npoints out, Shibuya did not present these arguments in its Rule 50(a) motion at trial \nand therefore it has waived them. \n\"A motion under Rule 50(b) is not allowed unless the movant sought relief \non similar grounds under Rule 50(a) before the case was submitted to the jury.\" \nExxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471,486 n.5 (2008); see also Kars 4 Kids \nInc. v. Am. Can!, 8 F.4th 209,220 (3d Cir. 2021) (\"[P]ost-trial Rule 50 motion can \nonly be made on grounds specifically advanced in a motion for a directed verdict at \nthe end of plaintiffs case.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); 9B \nCharles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a72537 (3d \ned.) (\"[T]he district court only can grant the Rule 50(b) motion on the grounds \nadvanced in the preverdict [Rule 50(a)] motion, because the former is conceived of \nas only a renewal of the latter.\"). \nShibuya does not dispute that it failed to raise in a Rule 50(a) motion the \ninvalidity arguments it makes now in its pending motion. Instead, it argues that it \nraised these arguments in its summary judgment motions and that \"[a] party \npreserves a legal issue by moving for summary judgment\" on that issue. D.I. 800 \n25 at 12. But as the authorities it cites in support of that assertion make clear, a \nmotion for summary judgment on an issue preserves that issue for an appeal, not \nfor a Rule 50(b) motion. See ePlus, Inc. v. Lawson Software, Inc., 700 F.3d 509, \n517-18 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (denial for motion of summary judgment on indefiniteness \npreserved that issue for appellate review); Ericsson Inc. v. TCL Commc 'n Tech. \nHoldings Ltd., 955 F.3d 1317, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\"Ericsson argues as a \nthreshold matter that TCL has waived any right to appeal the issue of ineligibility \nunder\u00a7 101 by failing to raise it in a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\"); SRI \nInt'/, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 930 F.3d 1295, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"We may \nreview this denial of summary judgment.\"); 9B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a72537 (3d ed.) (\"[W]hen a party has been \ndenied summary judgment, the failure to move for judgment as a matter of law will \nnot preclude that party from seeking appellate review of the denial of summary \njudgment.\"). \nAccordingly, I will deny Shibuya' s motion insofar as it seeks judgment of \ninvalidity of the asserted patents as a matter of law. \nII. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL AND VACATUR OF DAMAGES \nAWARD \nBecause I will enter judgment of noninfringement of the asserted patents, I \nneed not and do not address Shibuya's request to vacate the damages award and \ngrant a new trial. \n26 Under Rule 50(c)(l), \"[i]fthe court grants a renewed motion for judgment as \na matter of law, it must also conditionally rule on any motion for a new trial by \ndetermining whether a new trial should be granted if the judgment is later vacated \nor reversed.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(c)(l). In this case, were the Federal Circuit to \nvacate the judgment of noninfringement, I believe a new trial would be warranted \nbecause, as explained above, the jury's verdicts with respect to infringement of the \nasserted claims of the #985, # 188, and #591 patents are contrary to the evidence. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I will enter a judgment of noninfringement of \nthe asserted patents as a matter of law. I will also conditionally grant Shibuya's \nmotion for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50( c )( 1 ). \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n27 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSTEUBEN FOODS, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nSHIBUYA HOPPMANN CORP., \nSHIBUYA KOGYO CO., LTD., and \nHPHOODLLC, \nDefendants. C.A. No. 19-2181-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington on this Fourteenth day of March in 2023: \nFor the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion issued this day, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that Defendants' Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law \nor, Alternatively, for a New Trial (D.I. 795) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED \nIN PART: \n1. The motion is GRANTED insofar as it seeks a judgment of \nnoninfringement of the asserted patents; \n2. The motion is DENIED insofar as it seeks a judgment of invalidity of \nthe asserted patents; 3.
