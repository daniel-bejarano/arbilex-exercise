(\u201cMeta\u201d) , asserting state-law claims.  (D.I. 1).  Jackson moves for entry of \ndefault and for default judgment.  (D.I. 6, 7).  Meta moves for dismissal of the Complaint pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .  (D.I. 9).  Jackson  filed a motion to strike \nMeta\u2019s motion to dismiss.  (D.I. 12). \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn March 21, 2022, Jackson filed her Complaint, alleg ing that beginning in June 2020, \nMeta, which operates the online platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, shared her \npersonal information with unauthorized third parties and has  continued to do so despite her \ncommunications with its legal department requesting that the information sharing stop.  She also alleges that she notified Meta\u2019s legal department that she was being stalked by several people using Meta\u2019s platforms, and further notified the department as to who from \u201cthe authorities\u201d  could \nlegally contact Meta about Jackson\u2019s case.  Meta  then removed some of the information from \nJackson\u2019s private messaging without her permission, and has failed to return it to the messages, despite her requests.   Stalkers have continued to contact her  via Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, \nand WhatsApp. \nJackson brings claims for \u201cemotional distress,\u201d endangerment, negligence, and breach of \ncontract.  She seeks $10 million in damages. \nOn April 1 3, 2022, Jackson filed both a motion for entry of default and a motion for default \njudgment.  (D.I. 6, 7).\n1  The next day, Meta filed a motion to dismiss  (D.I. 9, 10), seeking dismissal \n \n1  Thes e motions will be denied.  Jackson served Meta  by mail with  the Complaint  on \nMarch  22, 2022.  (D.I. 8 at 2).  Meta had 24 days, until April 15, 2022, to file a responsive \npleading.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a), (b); Fed. R. Civ. P. (6)(d) ( three days are added to the 2 for failure to state a claim and based on forum selection clauses in the  terms of service and terms \nof use  in effect in June 2020 for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, all of which specified that \nclaims would be resolved exclusively in the United States District Court for th e Northern District \nof California or a California state court in San Mateo County.  ( See D.I. 11; D.I. 11- 1 at 6, 15, 24-\n25).  Jackson filed a motion to strike Meta\u2019s motion to dismiss, arguing that the motion is \n\u201cfraudulent and relies upon error of the court ,\u201d (D.I. 12 at 2), and generally argues that default \njudgment should be granted aga inst Meta.   Jackson also includes an email she sent to defense \ncounsel in which she asserted, \u201c I can serve you in Delaware because I am not serving the \nsubsidiaries of Meta, individually,\u201d and that the respective agreements were not revised after \nOctober 2 021 when Facebook\u2019s name was changed to Meta .  (Id. at 3-4).  Jackson additionally \nstated:  \nIf you wanted to move it you should have motioned for a transfer.  I \nfiled where I filed it, so I clearly don\u2019t agree.  If you want to transfer \nthan say that otherwise I will understand that you just asked for a dismissal instead because you thought you bought a clerk. \n (Id.).  Meta did not file a response to the motion to strike or a reply brief, to the extent the motion \nto strike is construed as a response in opposition to the motion to dismiss. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nBecause Jackson proceeds pro se , her pleading is liberally construed and her  Complaint, \n\u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted \nby lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).  When presented with a motion to \ndismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), district courts conduc t a two -part \nanalysis.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009).  First, the Court separates \n \ntime to respond when service is by mail ).  Meta timely filed its motion to dismiss on \nApril  14, 2022. 3 the factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the complaint\u2019s well -pleaded facts as \ntrue, but [disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d  Id. at 210- 11.  Second, the Court determines \n\u201cwhether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show . . . a \u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d  \nId. at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009)).  \n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u2019\u201d  Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate if a \ncomplaint does not contain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d  Iqbal , 556 U.S . at 678 (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570) ; see also \nFowler , 578 F.3d at 210.  A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.   \nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald assertions\u201d or \u201cunsupported conclusions \nand unwarranted inferences.\u201d  Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997); Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405, 417 (3d Cir. 1997).  Instead, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence o f [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff\u2019s claim.  Wilkerson v. New Media \nTech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A complaint may not  be dismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theo ry supporting \nthe claim asserted.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014) (per curiam).   4 III. DISCUSSION  \nThe Court will address  each of  Jackson\u2019s claims  in turn.2  Under Delaware law, a claim for \nnegligence must plead: duty, breach, causation, and damages.  Hudson v. Old Guard Ins. Co., \n3 A.3d 246, 250 (Del. 2010).  As noted, to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Complaint \u201c must \nstate enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] \nnecessary element \u201d of a negligence claim.  See Wilkerson , 522 F.3d at 321.  Jackson  has failed to \nallege facts demonstrating  a duty owed to her by Meta, a breach of that duty, or causation.  \nTherefore, the negligence claim will be dismissed .   \nAs to the breach -of-contract claim, t he Facebook and WhatsApp terms of service and  the \nInstagram  terms of use all indicate that they are governed by California law.  (D.I. 11- 1 at 6, 15, \n25).  The elements of a breach -of-contract claim under California law are:  (1) the existence of a \ncontract, (2) the plaintiff\u2019s  performance or excuse of nonperformance , (3) defendant\u2019s breach , and \n(4) resulting  damages  to the plaintiff.  Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman, 250 P.3d 1115, 1121 \n(Cal. 2011).3  Jackson has alleged the existence of a contract by asserting that \u201c[t]hey are in breach \nof contract with their user agreement with me as an account holder,\u201d (D.I. 1 at 6), but she has failed \nto plead fact s as to any of the other necessary elements.  Most notably, Jackson did not al lege how \n \n2  The Court does not herein address Meta\u2019s argument for dismissal based on the forum \nselection clauses because this argument  was i nsufficiently supported.  Specifically, Meta \ndid not address the clauses \u2019 enforceability, or lack thereof, by Meta as a non- signatory to \nthe respective terms of service, or address what body of law governs the answer to that question.  \n \n3  In Meta\u2019s motion  to dismiss, it argues that the breach -of-contract claim fails to state a claim \nunder Delaware law , which is a similar  standard .  See VLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett -Packard \nCo., 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del. 2003)  (requiring a plaintiff to prove : (1) existence of a \ncontract, (2) that the defendant breached an obligation imposed by the contract and (3) that plaintiff suffered damages from the breach ). 5 any provisions of the terms of service or use of service agreements were allegedly  breached.   \nAccordingly, t he breach -of-contract claim is also subject to dismissal.  \nTurning to the \u201cemotional distress\u201d claim, \u201c [u]nder Delaware law, a claim for neg ligent \ninfliction of emotional distress requires: (1) negligent conduct that proximately causes emotional \ndistress; and (2) the emotional distress is accompanied by non- transitory, recurring physical \nphenomena.\u201d  Grubbs v. Univ. of Del. Police Dep\u2019t , 174 F. Supp. 3d 839, 862 (D. Del. 2016) ; \nsee also Greene v. United States Postal Serv., 462 F. Supp. 2d 578, 580 (D. Del. 2006) (noting that to establish a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff \u201cmust show that the distress was sufficient to cause physical injury\u201d ) (quotation omitted).  Jackson does not allege a \nphysical injury and , therefore,  the emotional distress claim fails . \nFinally, regarding Jackson\u2019s claim for endangerment, the Court has previously concluded \nafter \u201c[a] thorough search of Delaware law ,\u201d that endangerment is a \u201ccriminal charge and cannot \nbe asserted in a civil action for damages.\u201d  Chambers v. Doe , 453 F. Supp. 2d 858, 866, 873 \n(D. Del. 2006).  Accordingly, the endangerm ent claim must be dismissed as well.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the C ourt will deny Jackson\u2019s motions for default and default \njudgment, grant Meta\u2019s motion to dismiss, and deny Jackson\u2019s motion to strike.  \nAn appropriate O rder will be entered.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nNAKISHA JACKSON,  \n \n   Plaintiff,  \n  v.
