North . \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nMarch 28, 2022  \n \n \n 2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nLetting parties amend their pleadings can simplify a case.  Even an amendment \nyears after the initial complaint  can clarify the issues. So a court should deny amend-\nment only if it is pointless , if it would hurt the defendant , or if the plaintiff dragged \nhis feet. Here, none of those factors  applies. Even though the SEC wants to amend  \nits complaint years after filing, I will let it  do so.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nWilmington Trust Corporation  is a bank . D.I. 1 \u00b6  1. It lent a lot of money  for real-\nestate projects . D.I. 1 \u00b6  2. And when the housing market collapsed in 2008, the value \nof its loan portfolio did too. Id.   \nBut Wilmington\u2019s  officers  may have lied to cover that up,  telling  investors that the  \nportfolio  was still healthy . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 4\u20135. So in May 2015, the  SEC filed this civil enforce-\nment action against Wilmington\u2019s  officers, alleging securities violations . Id. \u00b6 1.  \nThat same summer , federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against the officers \nfor \u201csubstantially the same allegations.\u201d D.I. 63, at 6; United States v. Wilmington \nTrust Corp. , No. 1: 15-cr-00023- RGA (D. Del.). They were convicted on all counts. D.I. \n63, at 7.  \nBut those convictions did not stand for long:  on appeal, t he Third Circuit reversed \ntwo of their  four convictions and vacated the rest. United States v. Harra, 985 F.3d \n196, 22 5 (3d Cir. 2021).  It did so becau se there was \u201cinsufficient evidence from which \na rational jury could find\u201d that the Wilmington officers  had lied. Id. at 204.  The pros-\necutors then petitioned for rehearing, which the Third Circuit denied months later.  \nD.I. 63, at 8.  3 Now , years after first filing its enforcement suit , the SEC wants  to amend its com-\nplaint. It says that  the change  would  \u201cbetter conform [the complaint]  to the Third \nCircuit\u2019s  \u2026 decision\u201d in the criminal case. D.I. 63 , at 1. \nII. THE SEC  MAY AMEND ITS COMPLAINT  \nFederal courts take a generous approach to pleading. Dole v. Arco Chem. Co. , 921 \nF.2d 484, 486\u2013 87 (3d Cir. 1990). So I should grant l eave to amend \u201c freely \u2026 when \njustice so requires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (2). But my discretion has limits . Dole, 921 \nF.2d a t 486. I should  deny amendment when the movant  has \u201cundu [ly] delay [ed],\u201d the \namendment would cause \u201cundue prejudice ,\u201d or it would  be \u201cfutil[ e].\u201d Foman v. Davis , \n371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). Here, these factors favor letting the SEC amend.  \nA. The SEC did not unduly delay  \n\u201cDelay becomes  \u2018undue \u2019\u201d if it puts \u201can unwarranted burden on the court or when \nthe plaintiff has had previous opportunities to amend. \u201d Bjorgung v. Whitetail Resort, \nLP, 550 F.3d 263, 266 (3d Cir. 2008). For  this inquiry, I \u201cfocus on the mo vant\u2019s reasons \nfor not amending sooner.\u201d Cureton  v. NCAA , 252 F.3d 267, 273 (3d Cir. 2001).  \nThe SEC wants to amend its complaint to better reflect a decision  from January \n2021. D.I. 63, at 1. True, it did not move to amend until seven months later. D.I. 63 \nat 1; D.I. 64, at 14\u2013 15; see also Harra, 985 F.3d at 196. Still, that delay was not undue.  \nFirst, this amendment does not  burden the  Court . It fell within t he parties\u2019 stipu-\nlated briefing schedule. After the opinion was filed in January 2021, the parties \nagreed to wait until the resolution of a rehearing petition. D.I. 55 , at 3. Then r ight \nafter that petition was denied, the parties submitted  a briefing sched ule for this mo-\ntion.  D.I. 58.  4 If anything, that plan  could have saved court time . Had the government prevailed \nin its rehearing  petition  in the criminal action , the SEC  might  not have  amend ed its \ncomplaint  here. See D.I. 63, at 9 \u201311. So that delay was reasonable. Cf. Lorenz v. CSX \nCorp. , 1 F.3 d 1406, 1414 (3d Cir. 1993) (finding \u201cunreasonable\u201d a three -year delay \nwhen plaintiff had already amended once before); Bjorgun g, 550 F.3d at 267 (denying \namendment when plaintiff \u201cdid nothing \u2026 despite being on notice\u201d for years).  \nSecond , the SEC did  not miss  \u201cprevious opportunit ies\u201d to amend . Cureton , 252 \nF.3d at  273. Courts den y amendment on that ground when plaintiffs fail to include \ntheir new theory in \u201cnumerous\u201d amended complaints . Lorenz , 1 F.3d at 1414;  accord  \nRolo v. City Investing Co. Liquidating Tr. , 155 F.3d 644, 654\u2013 55 (3d Cir. 1998). Yet  \nthe SEC has not amended its complaint before.  \nTrue, the SEC proposed this amendment more than six years after it first filed its \ncomplaint . See D.I. 1; D.I. 6 2. But \u201c[t]he mere passage of time\u201d does not stop an \namendment . Cureton , 252 F.3d at 273. Besides, t his case was inactive for much of \nthat time. T here was a three -year stay , then the parties delayed summary -judgment \nbriefing until after the criminal appeal . See D.I. 2 0; D.I. 31.; D.I. 53. Thus , the delay \nin SEC\u2019s  amendment was not undue.   \nB. Amendment will  not prejudic e the officers  \nAmendment will not lead to \u201cadditional discovery, cost, and preparation to defend \nagainst new facts or new theories .\u201d Cureton , 252 F.3d at 273. So the officers  will not \nsuffer \u201csubstantial or undue prejudice.\u201d  Id.  5 For one, discovery has not yet begun . D.I. 63, at 12, 15.  Thus , no \u201cadditional\u201d dis-\ncovery is yet possible. Id.; see also  Raymo v. Civitas Media LLC , 2020 WL 4003646, \nat *5\u2013 6 (M.D. Pa. July 15, 2020)  (finding no prejudice when discovery was  still \u201cin its \ninfancy\u201d) .  \nNext , as the SEC says, th e amendment merely  \u201caugment [s]\u201d existing claims . D.I. \n63, at 1. I agree . The new complaint  does not  \u201cfundamentally alter [] the proceeding .\u201d \nCureton , 252 F.3d at 274.  \nConsider the original complaint . The SEC first alleged that Wilmington officers \nlied to investors by underreporting the amount of its loans that were overdue (or soon \nto be). Id.  \u00b6 3. Overdue loans are an important metric for understanding the health of \na bank\u2019s loan business : when a loan is overdue (or soon to be ), that signals that the \nlender may not be paid back. D.I. 1  \u00b6 1.  \nNow consider what has changed since then. T he Third Circuit vacated the officers\u2019 \nconvictions  because it  doubt ed that Wilmington\u2019s  loans were  overdue. Harra , 985 \nF.3d at 218\u2013 19. The SEC instructs lenders to report \u201ccontractually past due\u201d loans. \nId. at 218. But Wilmington said it had extended the loans and  so presumed they did \nnot fall under that definition. Id. On appeal, the Court thought Wilmington\u2019s \nunderstanding was not \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Id . at 220. So Wilmington  may not have lied \nabout \u201coverdue\u201d loans.  Id. at 219.  \nBack  to the amendment. Even if the Third Circuit is right,  the SEC says, Wilming-\nton extended the  due dates for those loans  without adequately vetting them. D.I. 63 , \nat 2\u2013 3. Thus,  it still lied to investors about the quality of its loan business. Id. at 3. 6 That new detail does not change the action : it involves the same loans, the same SEC \nfilings, and the same claims as the original complaint. See  D.I. 63, at 1\u2013 2; D.I. 63 -2, \nat 53\u2013 64. Thus, the SEC does not change its theory ; instead it doubles down on it \nwith more detail. Cureton , 252 F.3d at 274.  \nStill, the officers fight back. They say the amendment adds a \u201cnew focus\u201d on its \nloan-review practices . D.I. 64 at 17. Not so. Wilmington\u2019s  underwriting procedures \nhave always been part of  this case. In deed, the original complaint  alleged that the \nWilmington officers  tried  to reduce the Bank\u2019s overdue loan burden by postponing the \ndeadlines  of some loans . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 35\u201338. The complaint also alleged that Wilmington  \ndelayed  those loans without adequate vetting, thus violating SEC  loan-review  \npolicies. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 38, 47 \u201348, 51\u2013 55, 60, 64, 72\u2013 74; see also  D.I. 64 , at 12 (conceding that \nthe original complaint alleged these f acts). The amendment builds on that foundation.  \nC. The amendment would not be futile   \n1. Statute of Limitations . The SEC wants to amend a complaint that seeks a dis-\ngorgement remedy. I f brought today,  that disgorgement claim  would be barred by the \nstatute of limitations  (plus tolling agreement) . D.I. 63 , at 16; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  78u(d)(8)  \n(disgorgement has a five- year statut e of limitations) . So unless it relates  back to the \ncomplaint, the amendment would be futile. Arab African Int\u2019l Bank v. Epstein , 10 \nF.3d 168, 175 (3d Cir. 1993).  \nAn amendment relate s back if it  make s a claim \u201car[ising] out of the conduct, trans-\naction, or occurrence set out\u201d in the complaint.  Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 15(c)(1)(B). That is, \nthe amendment and the original must share  \u201ca common \u2018core of operative fact. \u2019\u201d 7 Mayle v. Felix , 545 U.S. 644, 659 (2005).  Plus,  the officers  must have had \u201cfair notice\u201d \nof their  \u201cbasis for liability.\u201d Glover v. FDIC , 698 F.3d 139, 146 (3d Cir. 2012)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted) .  \nThe SEC clear s these hurdle s, so its amendment relates back . As I explained, t he \nagency  has always said  that the officer s lied about the quality  of Wilmington\u2019s  loan \nportfolio and its vetting process . D.I. 1  \u00b6\u00b6 4,  56. The new complaint just expand s on \nhow Wilmington leaders extended loans without vetting them . So the amendment \nsimply \u201crestate[s] the original claim[s] with greater particularity [and] amplif[ies] the \nfactual circumstances surrounding the pertinent conduct.\u201d Bensel v. Allied Pilots \nAss\u2019n , 387 F.3d 298, 310 (3d Cir. 2004).  \nThe officers say t hey had no notice of the  facts in the amendment. D.I. 64 , at 10\u2013\n12. In support, they encourage us to adopt reasoning from defamation cases . Id. at \n10. Because the amendment adds  new false hoods , they charge, the SEC  tries to add  \nnew grounds for liability.  Id. at 11\u201312. \nBut the defamation  analogy is inapposite. Extending loans without vetting them \nis \u201ca natural offshoot of the basic scheme to defraud investors by misrepresenting\u201d \nthe health of those  loans. In re Chaus Sec. Litig. , 801 F. Supp. 1257, 1264 (S.D.N.Y. \n1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord  In re Campbell Soup Co. Sec. Litig. , \n145 F. Supp. 2d 574, 602 (D.N.J. 2001) . Indeed, the amendment  merely  expands on \npast allegation s; it involves  the same SEC reports and the same loans that are dis-\ncussed in the original complaint. T hose detail s are the same \u201cin time and type\u201d as 8 those  in the original complaint,  so the officers had notice. Glover, 698 F.3d at 147  \n(internal quotation marks omitted) .  \n2. Plausibility . Last, an amendment is futile if it does not make a plausibl e claim . \nI apply the same standard that applies to a motion to dismiss. Shane v. Fauver, 213 \nF.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir. 2000). T he new complaint must have enough facts to \u201c state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face .\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  The amended  com-\nplaint hits that target. All claims have already survived a motion to dismiss. D.I. 44. \nAnd the amendments would  not chang e that outcome . See D.I. 64  (not disputing  plau-\nsibility ).  \n* * * * * \nThe SEC\u2019s  proposed amendment is timely , did not burden the court,  and will not \nprejudice the Wilmington officers . So the agency  may amend  its complaint .  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nSECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE  COM-\nMISSION  \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nROBERT  V.A.
