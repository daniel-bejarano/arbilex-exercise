McClendon , \nPetitioner, \nV. \nTIMOTHY C. WARD, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF GEORGIA , \nRespondents. Civil Action No. 21-32-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nPresently pending before the Court is Petitioner Justice Shunte McClendon 's Petition for \nWrit of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, an Amended Petition, and a Memorandum \nin Support. (D.I. 1; D.I. 3; D.I. 4) Petitioner is a prisoner at the Muscogee County Prison in \nColumbus, Georgia. He contends that his judgment of conviction is void, because Respondents \nare a Delaware corporate entity unlawfully detaining him and the Georgia court in which he was \nconvicted lacked both personal jurisdiction and subject-matter jurisdiction over his case. (D.I. 1 \nat 5, 7; D.I. 3 at 5, 7) According to Petitioner , the Court can review the instant proceeding \nbecause it has original jurisdiction over corporations that were incorporated in the State of \nDelaware. (D.I. 4) Petitioner asks the Court to order his immediate release from prison. (D.I. 1 \nat 12; D.I. 3 at 11) \nA federal district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \"if it plainly appears \nfrom the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to \nrelief.\" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. A district court can entertain a habeas petition \"in behalf \nof a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States,\" and only if the \nrelief sought is either immediate release or speedier release. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); see Freiser v. \nRodriguez , 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973), overruled on other grounds by Heck v. Humphrey, 512 \nU.S. 477,482 (1994)). \nAs an initial matter, the Court notes that it dismissed another habeas petition filed by Petitioner in \n2015 after determining that it lacked jurisdiction over Petitioner 's challenge to same Georgia conviction \nhe challenges here. (See McClendon v. Rush, Civ. A. No. 15-333-RGA at D.I. 3 & D.I. 4) \nPetitioner 's circumstances have not changed since that dismissal. Consequently , the Court again \nconcludes that it lacks jurisdiction over the instant proceeding , because Petitioner is not in \ncustody in the State of Delaware , he does not challenge a sentence or conviction imposed by the \nState of Delaware , and he does not challenge a sentence or conviction imposed by this Court. \nSince Petitioner is in custody in Georgia and challenges a conviction rendered by a George state \ncourt, the Courts with jurisdiction over the instant proceeding are in Georgia. See Rumsfeld v. \nPadilla, 542 U.S. 426, 434-35, 442 (2004) (state prisoner challenging the constitutionality of his \ncustody that is the result of a state court judgment of conviction , or his present physical \nconfinement that is not the result of a state court conviction must file the petition in a judicial \ndistrict which can achieve in personam jurisdiction over the petitioner 's warden or custodian); \nBraden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky , 410 U.S. 484, 494-95 (1973) (\"The writ ... \ndoes not act upon the prisoner who seeks relief, but upon the person who holds him in what is \nalleged to be unlawful custody.\") Accordingly , the Court will summarily dismiss the instant \n2 Petition, and will not issue a certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c )(2); United \nStates v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011). \nA separate Order follows. \nDated: January / 8-, 2022 \nUNITED STA \n3 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJUSTICE SHUNTE MCCLENDON , \nc/o Agent Tracy D. McClendon , \nPetitioner , \nV. \nTIMOTHY C. WARD, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF GEORGIA , \nRespondents. Civil Action No. 21-32-RGA \nA.
