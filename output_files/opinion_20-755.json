The parties \nsubmitted a Joint Claim Construction Brief (D.I. 75), and I heard oral argument on June 4, 2021 \n(D .I. 161 ). The parties argued for constructions of five claim terms, and I construed three terms \nat the hearing. (D.I. 119). I requested supplemental briefing on the remaining two terms, which \nthe parties have provided. (D.I. 125). I now construe the remaining two terms, which appear in \nthe '901 patent. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe '901 patent relates to \"an improved process to convert benzindene triol to treprostinil \nvia salts oftreprostinil and to purify treprostinil. \" ('901 patent, abstract). Plaintiff filed this \naction for infringement of the '066 patent and the '901 patent based on Defendant 's submission \nof New Drug Application No. 213005. (D.I. 1). Defendant petitioned for IPR of both patents. \n(D.I. 76-1, Exs. Pl & P2). The PTAB denied institution ofIPR for the '066 patent and granted \ninstitution ofIPR for the '901 patent. (D.I. 76-1, Ex. P3). On October 8, 2021, the PTAB issued \na final written decision, finding claims 1-5, 8, and 9 of the '901 patent to be unpatentable . \nLiquidia Techs., Inc. v. United Therapeutics Corp., No. IPR2020-00770, 2021 WL 4860733, at \n*1 (P.T.A.B . Oct. 8, 2021). The PTAB also found that Defendant had not established that claims \n6 and 7, which depend from claim 1, were unpatentable. Id. \nThe disputed terms appear in independent claim 1 and are also fully set forth in method \nclaim 8. The following claims are thus the most relevant for purposes of this Markman : \nClaim 1 of the '901 patent \n1. A pharmaceutical batch consisting of treprostinil or a salt thereof and impurities \nresulting from (a) alkylating a benzindene triol, (b) hydrolyzing the product of step (a) to \n1 form a solution comprising treprostinil, ( c) contacting the solution comprising treprostinil \nfrom step (b) with a base to form a salt of treprostinil, ( d) isolating the salt of treprostinil, \nand ( e) optionally reacting the salt of treprostinil with an acid to form treprostinil , and \nwherein the pharmaceutical batch contains at least 2.9 g of treprostinil or its salt. \nClaim 8 of the '901 patent \n8. A method of preparing a pharmaceutical batch as claimed in claim 1, comprising (a) \nalkylating a benzindene triol, (b) hydrolyzing the product of step (a) to form a solution \ncomprising treprostinil , (c) contacting the solution comprising treprostinil from step (b) \nwith a base to form a salt of treprostinil , (d) isolating the salt of treprostinil , and (e) \noptionally reacting the salt of treprostinil with an acid to form treprostinil. \nII.-LEGAL STANDARD \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed._ Cir-2005) ( en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted) \u008d '\" [T]here is no magic formula or \ncatechism for conducting claim construction. ' Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate \nweight to appropriate sources 'in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\"' \nSoftView LLC v. Apple Inc., 2013 WL 4758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (quoting Phillips, \n415 F.3d at 1324) (alteration in original). When construing patent claims, a court considers the \nliteral language of the claim, the patent specification , and the prosecution history. Markman v. \nWestview Instruments , Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 977-80 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 \n(1996). Of these sources, \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction \nanalysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\" \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning .... \n[Which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in \nquestion at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application. \" \nId. at 1312-13 ( citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he ordinary meaning of a \n2 claim term is its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\" Id. at 1321 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \"In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as \nunderstood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim \nconstruction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted \nmeaning of commonly understood words.\" Id. at 1314. \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evidence-the patent claims, the \nspecification , and the prosecution history-the court's construction is a determination oflaw. \nSee Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318,331 (2015). The court may also make \nfactual findings based upon consideration of extrinsic evidence , which \"consists of all evidence \nexternal to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony , \ndictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317-19 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Extrinsic evidence may assist the court in understanding the underlying technology , \nthe meaning of terms to one skilled in the art, and how the invention works. Id. Extrinsic \nevidence , however , is less reliable and less useful in claim construction than the patent and its \nprosecution history. Id. \nIII. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS \n1. \"pharmaceutical batch\" (claims 1-4, 6, and 8) \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: \"a specific quantity of treprostinil ( or its salt) \nthat is intended to have uniform character and quality, within specified limits, and \nis produced according to a single manufacturing order during the same cycle of \nmanufacture , wherein the uniform character and quality is such that it still \ncontains impurities resulting from the method by which it is produced \" \nb. Defendant 's proposed construction: \"pharmaceutical batch made according to the \nprocess recited in steps (a)-(d) and optionally (e), wherein no purification steps \nappear between alkylation and salt formation\" \nc. Court's construction : plain and ordinary meaning \n3 Plaintiffs proposed construction imports a definition from an FDA regulation , which \ndefines \"batch\" as \"a specific quantity of a drug or other material that is intended to have \nuniform character and quality, within specified limits, and is produced according to a single \nmanufacturing order during the same cycle of manufacture. \" 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.3(b)(2). \nPlaintiffs expert Dr. Robert Ruffolo asserts that a person of ordinary skill in the art \nwould have understood the term \"pharmaceutical batch\" to incorporate this regulatory definition \nsince the '901 patent is \"a pharmaceutical patent that is related to the commercial manufacturing \nof a pharmaceutical API of an FDA-approved marketed drug.\" (D.I. 76-1, Ex. P4, 175).1 But I \nam not convinced that a POSA would interpret the term \"pharmaceutical batch\" to incorporate an \nFDA regulatory definition , especially because there are no references to the FDA or to FDA \nregulations in the '901 patent. Thus, I deny Plaintiffs attempt to import this FDA regulatory \nguidance into the plain and ordinary meaning of this term. \nDefendant's proposed construction simply adds a limitation to the plain and ordinary \nmeaning of \"pharmaceutical batch\"-i.e., that no purification steps appear between alkylation \nand salt formation. In support of this construction , Defendant points to statements made by \nPlaintiff during the IPR of the '901 patent. For example, in its Patent Owner Preliminary \n1 Plaintiff also argues that \"pharmaceutical batch\" is distinct from \"batch.\" Plaintiff claims that a \nPOSA would understand that the claimed process includes a \"pharmaceutical batch,\" while the \nprior art process includes a \"batch.\" (D.I. 75 at 45-46). Plaintiff reasons that the claimed process \ninvolves commercial manufacturing , while the prior art process describes a smaller-scale drug \ndevelopment process. (Id. at 46; D.I. 76-1, Ex. P4, 186). I am unclear as to how this distinction \nis reflected in Plaintiffs proposed construction. To the extent that Plaintiff is arguing that \n\"pharmaceutical\" denotes a commercial character , I cannot agree. The '901 patent specification \nexpressly defines \"pharmaceutically acceptable \" as \"being useful in preparing a pharmaceutical \ncomposition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable \nand includes being useful for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use.\" ('901 patent, \n5:27-31; see also D.I. 78-1, Ex. D9 at 113:12-115:20 ). This definition includes no reference to a \n\"commercial\" character . It does not seem consistent with Plaintiffs argument that a POSA \nwould understand \"pharmaceutical batch\" to import an FDA definition. \n4 Response, Plaintiff argued that the prior art did not permit large-scale synthesis. Plaintiff told \nthe PT AB, \"This perspective is critical in the context of the claimed phannaceutical composition , \nin which, e.g., no purification steps appear between alkylation and salt formation .\" (D.I. 77-1, \nEx. D5 at 56; see also Ex. D7 at 58 (\"Rather, the POSA must have been motivated to combine \nthe prior art in the way claimed in the '901 patent ( e.g., not purified before salt formation) , and \nhad a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.\")). Defendant argues that these statements \namount to a disclaimer of an intermediate purification step. (D.I. 75 at 47). \nThe Federal Circuit has held, \"[S]tatements made by a patent owner during an IPR \nproceeding , whether before or after an institution decision, can be considered for claim \nconstruction and relied upon to support a finding of prosecution disclaimer. \" Aylus Networks, \nInc. v. Apple Inc., 856 F.3d 1353, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \"Of course, to invoke the doctrine of \nprosecution disclaimer , any such statements must 'be both clear and unmistakable. \"' Id. at 1361. \nPlaintiff withdrew the purported disavowals before the PT AB took any steps in reliance on them. \n(See D.I. 125-1, Ex. Jl; Ex. 12 at 36:7-8, 69:14). Thus, I find no clear and unmistakable \ndisclaimer of claim scope. \nDefendant 's construction is also inconsistent with the '901 patent specification , which \ndiscloses examples where there are purification steps between alkylation and salt formation. (See \nD.I. 76-1, Ex. P4, ,r,r 54, 92). Example 2, \"Hydrolysis of Benzindene Nitrile,\" describes \nremoving impurities with ethyl acetate; washing with water, a solution ofNaHCO3 , and a \nsolution of NaCl; and filtering with Celite\u00ae 545. ('901 patent, 11 :58-12:14). Thus, I decline to \nadopt Defendant's proposed construction . \nI instead apply the plain and ordinary meaning, which is, as always, the default in claim \nconstruction. Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \n5 2. \"contacting the solution comprising treprostinil from step (b) with a base to \nform a salt of treprostinil\" ( claims 1 and 8) \na. Plaintiff's proposed construction: plain and ordinary meaning \nb. Defendant 's proposed construction : \"contacting the solution comprising \ntreprostinil from step (b) with a base to form a salt of treprostinil , wherein the salt \nis formed without isolation of treprostinil after alkylation and hydrolysis \" \nc. Court's construction: \"contacting the solution comprising treprostinil from step \n(b) with a base to form a salt of treprostinil , wherein the salt is formed without \nisolation of treprostinil after alkylation and hydrolysis \" \nIn its final written decision, the PT AB construed this term and agreed with Defendant \nthat, based on the intrinsic evidence, \"treprostinil is not isolated from the solution formed in step \n(b) before forming a salt in step (c).\" Liquidia, No. IPR2020-00770 , 2021 WL 4860733, at *12. \n\"The PT AB' s construction is not binding on this Court, but, where the construction is similar to \nthat of a district court's review, it is appropriate for me to take the PT AB' s claim construction \ninto consideration .\" Genuine Enabling Tech., LLC v. Sony Corp., 2020 WL 1140910, at *7 (D. \nDel. Mar. 9, 2020) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, it is appropriate for me \nto consider the PT AB' s construction of this term because the PT AB applied \"the same claim \nconstruction standard that would be used to construe the claim in a civil action under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n282(b)\"-i.e. , the Phillips standard. Liquidia, No. IPR2020-00770 , 2021 WL 4860733, at *7 \n(quoting 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.l00(b)). \nI find the PTAB's reasoning to be persuasive. First, the claim language supports a \nconstruction excluding an intermediate isolation step. Step ( c) of claim 1 requires \"contacting \nthe solution comprising treprostinilfrom step (b) with a base to form a salt of treprostinil. \" ('901 \npatent, 17:27-29 (emphasis added)). This claim language dictates that the solution oftreprostinil \nfrom step (b )-not treprostinil isolated as a solid from step (b )-is what is used to form a salt in \nstep (c). \n6 Second, the '901 patent specification supports this construction. Example 2 provides, \n\"The filtrate (pale-yellow) was reduced to volume of 35-40 L by evaporation in vacuo at 50-55\u00b0 \nCfor direct use in next step.\" (Id., 12:15-17 (emphasis added)). Example 3 describes the next \nstep, conversion of treprostinil to treprostinil diethanolamine salt. It provides, \"A 50-L, \ncylindrical reactor ... was charged with a solution of treprostinil in ethyl acetate (35-40 Lfrom \nthe previous step) .... \" (Id., 13:13-17 (emphasis added)). These examples are consistent with \nthe claim language and show that the solution of treprostinil formed in step (b) is used \nimmediately in step (c), with no isolation oftreprostinil between the steps.2 \nPlaintiff argues that Defendant 's construction improperly reads out a preferred \nembodiment of the claimed invention. (See D.I. 75 at 64; D.I. 161 at 68:10-71:14). Example 2 \nprovides that the treprostinil is formed in an aqueous layer and then \"extracted with ethyl acetate \n... to remove impurities soluble in ethyl acetate.\" ('901 patent, 11:58-60). The treprostinil is \ntransferred from the aqueous layer to the organic layer (ethyl acetate). (Id., 11:62-12:3). The \norganic solution is then used in the salt formation step. (Id., 12:15-17 ; D.I. 161 at 67:8-15, \n69:20-70 : 19). Plaintiff contends that, in this example, treprostinil is isolated before the salt \nformation step, so Defendant 's construction is improper. (See D.I. 161 at 73:3-74:23). \n2 Defendant also argues that Plaintiff disclaimed an intermediate isolation step through \nstatements made during the IPR of the '901 patent. (See, e.g., D.I. 77-1, Ex. D7 at 11 (\"[C]laim 1 \nrequires the solution in which treprostinil is formed be used directly in the next salt-forming step \nwithout isolating treprostinil in between.\"); id. at 15 (\"Each claim of the '901 patent further \nrequires forming the salt without isolating the intermediate acid.\"). Plaintiff later withdrew these \nstatements. (D.I. 125-1, Ex. J2 at 22:10-14 , 26:12-13). The PTAB dismissed Plaintiff's request \nto withdraw these statements as moot because it construed the \"contacting\" term based solely on \nthe intrinsic evidence. Liquidia, No. IPR2020-00770 , 2021 WL 4860733, at *22. Since the \nPT AB did not rely on these withdrawn statements , I find no clear and unmistakable disclaimer of \nclaim scope. Regardless , the intrinsic evidence supports Defendant 's construction , and thus I \nwould reach the same result whether I considered the statements or not. \n7 Defendant responds that this example involves purification , not isolation, and that \nPlaintiff and its expert are conflating the terms \"purification \" and \"isolation. \" (Id. at 71:19-72:6 ). \nI agree. At oral argument , Plaintiff referred to Example 2's steps as \"purification steps,\" not \n\"isolation steps.\" (See, e.g., id. at 66:4-6 (\"There are purification and work-up steps that are \nidentified in example two .... \"); id. at 67:15-17 (\"[T]here are purification steps in between.\"); \nid. at 71: 12-14 (\"[W]e just saw that there's purification steps that are occurring there.\")). Dr. \nRuffolo also referred to these steps as \"purification steps\" in his initial declaration. (D.I. 76-1, \nEx. P4, ,r 54; Ex. PS, ,r 17). \nIn his supplemental declaration, Dr. Ruffolo states, \"[A] POSA would understand that a \ncompound can be purified to isolation, even while it is maintained in a solvent, which is often \ndone for practical considerations (e.g., material transfer) in manufacturing plants.\" (Id., Ex. PS, ,r \n21; see also id., ,r 15 (\"[I]t is common for compounds to be isolated (i.e., separated from many \nimpurities and other contaminants resulting from previous chemical reactions) and retained in a \nsolution state in commercial manufacturing processes for practical reasons, such as facilitating \nmaterial transfer.\"); id., ,r 17 (\"It is clear that these many purification steps result in isolation of \ntreprostinil (from many impurities and contaminants) prior to the salt formation step, regardless \nof whether the isolated treprostinil is in an aqueous phase, organic phase or solid phase.\")). But \nDr. Ruffolo' s assertions that isolation and purification are essentially the same and that a \ncompound can be isolated even when it is still in solution are inconsistent with the use of the \nterms \"isolation\" and \"purification \" in the '901 patent. \nThe '901 patent specification uses both terms, but in different contexts. (See, e.g., '901 \npatent, 16:67-17:1 (\"The purification ofbenzindene nitrile by column chromatography is \neliminated.\"); 17:8-10 (\"[T]he treprostinil salts can be synthesized from the solution of \n8 treprostinil without isolation. \"). There are no places in the '901 patent where these terms appear \nto be used as synonyms. Thus , I think it is reasonable to conclude that these terms have different \nmeanings in the '901 patent. See Amgen Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 923 F.3d 1023, 1031 (Fed. Cir. \n2019) (\"[D]ifferent claim terms are presumed to have different meanings. \" (quoting Helmsderfer \nv. Bobrick Washroom Equip., Inc., 527 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2008))). \nThe patent specification uses the terms \"isolation\" and \"isolating\" in the context of \nisolating a compound as a solid. For example, step (d) in claim 1 requires \"isolating the salt of \ntreprostinil. \" ('901 patent, 17:29). The specification explains that the salt is isolated as a solid. \n(Id., 13:24--27 (\"The treprostinil diethanolarnine salt was collected by filtration using Aurora \nfilter equipped with filter cloth, and the solid was washed with ethyl acetate (2x8 L).\")). Thus, \nDefendant 's construction does not read out Example 2, because Example 2 discloses purification \nsteps, not the isolation oftreprostinil as a solid. (See D.I. 161 at 70:20-71 :2 (\"The only \ndifference is that it's never reduced to dryness. So, you don't ever have in this specific example a \nsolid form .... \")). \nI will therefore adopt Defendant 's proposed construction , as it is consistent with the claim \nlanguage and the specification. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nWithin five days the parties shall submit a proposed order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion. \n9 "}
