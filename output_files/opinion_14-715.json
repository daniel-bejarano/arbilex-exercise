Civ. No. 14-715-LPS \nWilliam R. Altemus, Millsboro, Delaware, Pro Se Plaintiff. \nDavid C. Weiss, U.S. Attorney, and Shamoor Anis, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Wilmington, Delaware, \nCounsel for Defendant. \nJanuary 12, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION U.S. District Judge: \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff William R. Altemus (\"Plaintiff'), who proceeds prose, commenced this action on \nJune 6, 2014. He filed an Amended Complaint on March 2, 2021. (D.I. 54) Before the Court is \nDefendant's motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment . (D.I. 55, 59) \nII. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff, a U.S. Air Force veteran, has sought and received medical and disability benefits \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA\"). The original complaint raised the following \nclaims: (1) Plaintiff was treated unfairly and unlawfully in connection with his application for \nincreased disability benefits; (2) medical malpractice; (3) defamation; ( 4) violations of constitutional \nrights; and (5) violations of the Freedom of Information and/ or Privacy Act (\"FOIA/PA\"), 5 U.S.C. \n552 and 552a. On November 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed a motion to withdraw his complaint, construed \nby the Court as a motion to voluntarily dismiss the complaint. (D.I. 40, 42) The case was closed on \nNovember 16, 2015. (D.I. 42) \nOn April 27, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case, the case was reopened, and \nPlaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on March 2, 2021. (D.I. 43, 53, 54) The Amended Complaint \nseeks to obtain evidentiary documents, including all electronic documents, from the VA not \nprovided for 2012 to 2021 and \"reconfirms there is no request for court involvement regarding \nbenefit award.1 (D.I. 54 at 3) \nDefendant moves for dismissal pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 12(6)(6) on the grounds that \nPlaintiff never submitted his FOIA request to the VA and failed to exhaust his administrative \n1 The Amended Complaint states that in December 2017 Plaintiff successfull y obtained 100 percent \ntotal disability without any new evidence. (D.I. 54 at 2) \n1 remedies prior to filing suit. (D.I. 55 at 1) When Plaintiff failed to file a response to the motion, he \nwas ordered to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute. (D.I. 56) \nPlaintiff filed a response and a week later filed a motion for summary judgment.2 (D.I. 57, 59) \nDefendant opposes the motion. (D.I. 60) \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(6)(6) requires the \nCourt to accept as true all material allegation s of the complaint . See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 223 \n(3d Cir. 2004). \"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims .\" In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, \n1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court may grant such a motion to \ndismiss only if, after \"accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them \nin the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d \n472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions. See Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); BellAtL Corp. v. Twombjy, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A plaintiff \nmust plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility . See Johnson v. Ciry of \nShelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not dismissed , however, for imperfect statements of \nthe legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \"In evaluating a motion to dismiss,\" the \nCourt \"may consider documents that are attached to or submitted with the complaint ... 'matters \nincorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, matters of public \n2 The Court finds Plaintiff has shown cause why the case should not be dismissed. \n2 record, orders, [and] items appearing in the record of the case.\"' Buck v. Hampton Twp. Sch. Dist., 452 \nF.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir. 2006). \n\"To survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that 'raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if \ndoubtful in fact).\"' Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Twomb!J, 550 \nU.S. at 555). A claim is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. At bottom, \"[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable \nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\" of a plaintiffs claim. \nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \"bald assertions,\" Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \"unsupported conclusions and \nunwarranted inferences, \" Sch~lki/1 Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405, \n417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \"self-evidently false,\" Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d \nCir. 1996). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Amended \nComplaint:, \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal \npleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nIV. DISCUSSION \nA. Motion to Dismiss \nDefendant seeks dismissal on the grounds that the Amended Complaint contains no legal \nclaims and, instead, requests documents and, therefore, is governed by the Freedom of Information \n3 Act (\"FOIA\"). (D.I. 55) Defendant argues that Plaintiff never submitted a FOIA request to the VA \nand did not exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit. \nTo the extent Plaintiff raises a FOIA claim, the claim fails as pled. \"[T)he FOIA requires \nexhaustion of the administrative appeals process before an individual may seek relief in the district \ncourt.\" Conlry v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 714 F. App'x 191, 194 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting McDonnell v. \nUnited States, 4 F.3d 1227, 1240 (3d Cir. 1993)). The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff's \nattempts to resolve issues \"administratively failed\" but does not provide facts to explain this \nstatement. (D.I. 54 at 1) In Plaintiff's response to the show cause order, he states that he \"pursued \nsignificant efforts for administrative resolve over the years.\" (D.I. 57 at 3) He also provides a copy \nof a complaint that refers to his numerous FOIA requests, but the list of FOIA requests is not \nincluded in the Amended. Complaint. (See D.I. 57 at Ex. 2) \nAs pled, the Amended Complaint does not specificall y identify the FOIA requests made by \nPlaintiff or whether he exhausted administrative remedies as to each request. Therefore, \nDefendant's motion to dismiss will be granted. (D.I. 55) Plaintiff will be given leave to file a second \namended complaint to cure his pleading defects. \nB. Motion for Summary Judgment \nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment is premature. (D.I. 59) A scheduling order has not \nbeen entered and discovery has not yet commenced. Therefore , the motion will be denied without \nprejudice as premature. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court: (1) finds that Plaintiff has shown cause why the case \nshould not be dismissed; (2) will grant Defendant's motion to dismiss (D.I. 55); (3) will give Plaintiff \n4 leave to file a second amended complaint ; and ( 4) will deny without prejudice as premature \nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment (D.I. 59). \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n5 "}
