No. 22-1302-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nIt came to the Court's attention this afternoon that the Clerk's Office \ninadvertently allowed Mr. Miller to make electronic filings for Plaintiffs. \nAlthough Mr. Miller is a member of this Court's bar, his firm does not have a \nDelaware office and he is therefore not authorized to make filings with the Court \nunless and until the Court has approved an application made by him under Local \nRule 83.5(t)(2). \nFurther, given the nature of this case, the Court does not believe that \nexceptional circumstances exist to justify approving an application by Mr. Miller under Local Rule 83.5(f)(2).1 Accordingly, if Plaintiffs wish to pursue this matter \nin this Court, Plaintiffs need to retain a Delaware lawyer with a Delaware office. \n1 Plaintiffs, for example, are not government agencies; nor do they appear to suffer \nfrom financial hardship. \n2 "}
