Howard, and Val Leppert, KING & SPALDING \nLLP, Atlanta, GA \nAttorneys for Defendant \nApril 14,2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION On January 27, 2016, Plaintiffs Rosario Godreau-Rivera and Jose Rivera-Kercado \n(\"Plaintiffs \") filed a lawsuit against Defendant Coloplast Corp. (\"Defendant \" or \"Coloplast \") in \nmulti-district litigation (\"MDL\") then pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof West Virginia. (See D.I. 1) Plaintiffs asserted 17 counts arising from the injuries allegedly \ncaused by Defendant's Restorelle \u00ae DirectFix (\"Restorelle \") polypropylene surgical mesh device \nimplanted during Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. (See D.I. 1 ,r 13; \nD.I. 102 at 1) \nOn September 26, 2019, after the time to conduct discovery was complete and the parties \nhad filed motions to exclude expert testimony (\"Daubert motions\") and motions for summary \njudgment in the MDL (see D.I. 80), Plaintiffs ' individual case was transferred to this Court. (See \nD.I. 67, 75) This Court denied all then-pending motions without prejudice to renew and set out \nprocedures for the parties to file case-specific Daubert and summary judgment motions in this \ncase. (See D.I. 87 at 4-5; D.I. 105 at 10-11) Pursuant to these procedures , Defendant filed \nseveral Daubert and summary judgment motions, which are pending before the Court.1 (See D.I. \n101) \n1 After Defendant filed the opening brief in support of its case-specific Daubert and summary \njudgment motions, Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike Defendant 's motions, contending that \nDefendant had violated the Court's procedures for renewing motions and had waived certain \nissues by failing to raise them in the MDL motions. (See D.I. 103, 104, 109, 110) The Court \nheard argument on the motion to strike and denied the motion. (See D.I. 118; D.I. 121 at 20) \nThe Court, however, allowed the parties to address -in additional pages of the then-forthcoming \nanswering and reply briefs of the pending Daubert and summary judgment motions -pertinent \nissues raised in the motion to strike, including the waiver issue. (See D.I. 118; D.I. 121 at 20-21) \n1 The Court has reviewed the parties' briefs and other materials submitted in connection \nwith the pending motions. (See, e.g., D.I. 102, 122-24, 126, 128, 129, 132, 134, 136-39)2 The \nCourt also heard oral argument via teleconference on April 27, 2021. (See D.I. 133) (\"Tr.\") \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Daubert Motions \nIn Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical s, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993), the \nSupreme Court explained that Federal Rule of Evidence 702 creates \"a gatekeeping role for the \n[trial] judge\" in order to \"ensur[e] that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation \nand is relevant to the task at hand.\" Rule 702(a) requires that permissible expert testimony \"help \nthe trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Expert testimony is \nadmissible only if \"the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data,\" \"the testimony is the \nproduct of reliable principles and methods, \" and \"the expert has reliably applied the principles \nand methods to the facts of the case.\" Fed. R. Evid. 702(b)-(d). There are three distinct \nrequirements for admissible expert testimony: (1) the expert must be qualified ; (2) the opinion \nmust be reliable; and (3) the expert's opinion must relate to the facts. See generally Elcock v. \n2 Given the size of the MDL and the numerous remand proceedings that have already occurred in \nother courts, it is unsurprising that essentially every issue raised in Defendant 's motions has been \nlitigated in other courts -usually, quite extensively. The Court directed the parties to prepare a \ntable that, as of May 2021, listed every decision of the MDL court and the remand courts that \naddressed one or more of the Daubert issues raised in Defendant's pending motions. (See D.I. \n13 7; see also D .I. 13 8 (Defendant advising Court in February 2022 of supplemental authority \ngranting motions to exclude opinions of Drs. Mays and Pence); D.I. 139 (Plaintiffs advising \nCourt in February 2022 of five opinions permitting Dr. Mays' testimony and seven opinions \npermitting Dr. Rosenzweig's testimony)) The Court has found this table (as well as the parties' \nsubsequent filings), and the decisions summarized , to be helpful in its analysis. Although none \nof the opinions listed in the table are binding on this Court, many are persuasive , and the Court \nhas benefited from considering each of them. Many are cited elsewhere in this Memorandum \nOpinion. \n2 Kmart Corp., 233 F.3d 734, 741-46 (3d Cir. 2000). Rule 702 embodies a \"liberal policy of \nadmissibility.\" Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237,243 (3d Cir. 2008). \nB. Summary Judgment Motion \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.\" Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, \n5 86 n.10 ( 1986). An assertion that a fact cannot be -or, alternatively, is -genuinely disputed \nmust be supported either by citing to \"particular parts of materials in the record, including \ndepositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations , stipulations \n(including those made for the purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, \nor other materials,\" or by \"showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or \npresence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to \nsupport the fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(l)(A) & (B). If the moving party has carried its burden, \nthe nonmovant must then \"come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue \nfor trial.\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). The \nCourt will \"draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make \ncredibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., \n530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). \nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment , the non-moving party must \"do more than \nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\" Matsushita , 475 \nU.S. at 586; see also Podohnikv. US Postal Serv., 409 F.3d 584,594 (3d Cir. 2005) (stating \nparty opposing summary judgment \"must present more than just bare assertions, conclusory \n3 allegations or suspicions to show the existence of a genuine issue\") (internal quotation marks \nomitted). However , the \"mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will \nnot defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;\" and a factual dispute \nis genuine only where \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the \nnonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). \"If the \nevidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be \ngranted.\" Id. at 249-50 (internal citations omitted); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. \n317, 322 (1986) (stating entry of summary judgment is mandated \"against a party who fails to \nmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, \nand on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial\"). Thus, the \"mere existence of a \nscintilla of evidence\" in support of the non-moving party's position is insufficient to defeat a \nmotion for summary judgment; there must be \"evidence on which the jury could reasonably \nfind\" for the non-moving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. Daubert Motions \n1. Rosenzweig \na. Specific Causation \nDefendant seeks to exclude Dr. Rosenzweig 's specific causation opinions, first \ncontending that Dr. Rosenzweig is not qualified to offer these opinions. (See D.I. 102 at 3) The \nCourt disagrees. Dr. Rosenzweig \"has performed over 1,000 pelvic floor surgeries,\" \"including \nmore than 300 revision surgeries addressing complications associated with synthetic mesh \nproducts, specifically including the removal of numerous Coloplast products.\" (D .I. 122 at 1; see \nalso id. Ex. B at 2) He has also \"published numerous articles and given many lectures on the \n4 treatment of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.\" (D.I. 122 at 1; see id Ex. A) Dr. \nRosenzweig is well-qualified to offer specific causation opinions on Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's \nRestorelle implant. \nDefendant next argues that Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinion that \"(Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's] \nRestorelle caused her alleged pelvic pain, vaginal pain, dyspareunia, pelvic muscle spasms, \nurinary dysfunction, and the need for mesh excision\" is unreliable because he failed to perform a \ncompetent differential diagnosis. (D.I. 102 at 4) According to Defendant, Dr. Rosenzweig \n\"omits critical elements of [Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's] medical history\" and fails to provide \"any \nexplanation for ruling out fibromyalgia as the cause of (Ms. Godreau-Rivera's] complaints.\" (Id \nat 4-5) Plaintiffs counter that Dr. Rosenzweig has performed a \"thorough and reliable \ndifferential diagnosis,\" adding that \"he explicitly states how he arrived at his conclusions \nregarding (Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's] injuries and how he eliminated other potential causes in his \ndeposition.\" (D .I. 122 at 4) \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Dr. Rosenzweig's differential diagnosis is \ncompetent and his specific causation opinions are sufficiently reliable. Differential diagnosis \n\"must be properly performed in order to be reliable.\" Feit v. Great W Life & Annuity Ins. Co., \n271 F. App'x 246, 254 (3d Cir. 2008). A proper differential diagnosis requires that the expert \nscientifically rule in and then rule out by eliminating alternative causes of a plaintiff's injuries. \nSee id \nDr. Rosenzweig has adequately considered and ruled out the potential alternative causes \nnoted by Defendant. (See D.I. 102 at 4) For example, with respect to fibromyalgia, Dr. \nRosenzweig explained that Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's \"pelvic pain and dyspareunia went away after \nher hysterectomy while she was still having ongoing fibromyalgia.\" (D.I. 122 Ex.Cat 135) Dr. \n5 Rosenzweig also testified that Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's pains, which were \"temporally related to\" \nthe Restorelle implantation, \"improved\" after the mesh implant was removed. (Id. at 150) In \naddition, contrary to Defendant's contention that Dr. Rosenzweig failed to account for Ms. \nGodreau-Rivera's medical history between her hysterectomy in 2008 and her visit to Dr. Vakili \nin 2014, Dr. Rosenzweig explained at deposition that he had considered Ms. Godreau-Rivera's \ncomplaints of pelvic pain in her medical records during that period. (See id. at 101) (\"There \nwere complaints [ of pelvic pain] that were associated with her prolapse [ after the hysterectomy \nbut before seeing Dr. Vakili].\"))3 Further, the purported inconsistency between Dr. \nRosenzweig's testimony and Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's pain complaints in her medical records (see \nD.I. 128 at 6; D.I. 129 Ex. 1) goes to the weight of Dr. Rosenzweig's opinions but does not \nprovide a persuasive basis for exclusion. \nAccordingly , the Court will deny this portion of Defendant's motion. \nb. Ms. Rosario Godreau-Rivera's Continued Complications \nDefendant contends that Dr. Rosenzweig should be precluded from testifying that Ms. \nGodreau-Rivera \"will have continued and ongoing complications\" because the purported factual \npredicate of this opinion-that the \"majority of Ms. Godreau-Rivera's Direct Fix still remains in \nher pelvic tissue\"4 -is contradicted by Dr. V akili' s operative notes and deposition testimony that \n3 Because of the applicable schedule, Dr. Rosenzweig did not have the benefit of Ms. Godreau\u00ad\nRivera' deposition testimony at the time he prepared his expert report. Defendant, therefore, \nfaults the expert report for purportedly failing to consider her complaints of dyspareunia in 2010, \nwhich she testified about in her deposition. (See Tr. at 10-11) At his own subsequent deposition, \nhowever, Dr. Rosenzweig testified that he had by then been provided with Ms. Godreau-Rivera's \ndeposition testimony (see D.I. 122 Ex.Cat 9) and it did not change anything in his opinions. \n(See Tr. at 28) Again, Defendant may cross-examine Dr. Rosenzweig on this point, but it does \nnot render his opinion inadmissible. \n4 In his expert report, Dr. Rosenzweig states that \"[t]he majority of Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's Direct \nFix still remains in her pelvic tissue.\" (D.1. 102 Ex. 6 at 12) However, during his deposition , Dr. \n6 he removed the entire implant. (See D.I. 102 at 5-6; see also id Ex. 3 at 92-94 (\"I did document \nin the findings it was removed in its entirety.\")) Plaintiffs counter that any conflict between Dr. \nRosenzweig's \"continued complications\" opinions and Dr. Vakili's operative notes and \ntestimony is not ground for exclusion but, instead, cross-examination. (See D.I. 122 at 6) This \nportion of Defendant's motion will be denied. \nDr. Rosenzweig considered Dr. Vakili's operative notes and deposition testimony and \nconcluded, nonetheless, that there were fragments of mesh remaining in Ms. Godreau-Rivera's \npelvic tissue, even after Dr. Vakili purportedly removed the mesh \"in its entirety.\" (See D.I. 122 \nEx.Cat 154-55; see also Tr. at 32-33) Although Dr. Rosenzweig admitted he did not have \n\"direct evidence\" to support his conclusion (see D.I. 122 Ex.Cat 155), he opined that \"there are \nmore likely than not fragments of mesh since it was transected to be removed in two pieces.\" \n(See id; see also Tr. at 33) \nThe dispute between the experts' assessment of the existence of mesh fragments \nremaining in Ms. Godreau-Rivera's pelvic tissue goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of Dr. \nRosenzweig's opinions. See generally United States v. Mitchell, 365 F.3d 215,244 (3d Cir. \n2004) (\"Daubert does not require that a party who proffers expert testimony carry the burden of \nproving to the judge that the expert's assessment of the situation is correct.\"). It is not, in the \nCourt's view, a basis to exclude Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinions.5 \nRosenzweig clarified that his report should have said a \"minority\" of Ms. Godreau-Rivera's \nmesh implant remained in her pelvic tissue. (See D.I. 122 Ex.Cat 155) (\"That should have said \na minority of the mesh remains in her body.\") \n5 Dr. Rosenzweig's \"continued complication\" opinions are not based solely on the mesh \nfragments he believes remain in Ms. Godreau-Rivera's pelvic tissue. (See Tr. at 34) In his \nreport, Dr. Rosenzweig also opines that Ms. Godreau-Rivera \"will likely continue to suffer other \ninjuries associated with the original implantation of the device.\" (D.I. 102 Ex. 6 at 13) \n7 c. The \"Blind Passage\" Procedure \nDefendant contends that Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinion that the Restorelle implant is \"unsafe \nbecause the implanting surgeon must perform a 'blind passage\"' should be excluded as \nunsubstantiated . (See D.I. 102 at 6) This portion of Defendant 's motion will be denied. \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinions on the \"blind passage\" \nprocedure are well-grounded in his extensive clinical experience with pelvic floor surgery and \nmesh products. (See D.I. 122 at 8) Dr. Rosenzweig sufficiently explains in his expert report that \nthe \"blind passage\" is unsafe because \"[i]t creates an inherently, unreasonably dangerous risk of \ncausing perforated and/or lacerated organs and excessive damage to nerves, vascular structures \nand other tissues.\" (Id. Ex.Eat 43) This opinion is sufficientl y grounded in the evidence and \nwill not be excluded as unreliable. \nd. Degradation Of Restorelle In Vivo \nDefendant seeks to exclude Dr. Rosenzwe ig's opinions on the degradation of \npolypropylene in vivo because he \"is not an expert in polymer science nor a chemist\" and, hence, \n\"lack[s] expertise in the relevant, specialized disciplines. \" (D.I. 102 at 7) The Court does not \nagree. As a surgeon who has performed over 1,000 pelvic floor surgical procedures , including \nover 300 procedures dealing with complications related to synthetic mesh, Dr. Rosenzweig has \nsufficient familiarity with the behavior of mesh products in the human body. (See D.I. 122 Ex. B \nat 2) Thus, Dr. Rosenzweig is qualified to offer opinions on the degradation of polypropylene \nmesh products in vivo. \"Any gaps in Dr. Rosenzweig 's knowledge [concerning mesh \ndegradation] go to his credibility , not his admissibili ty as an expert.\" Wilkerson v. Bos. Sci. \nCorp., 2015 WL 2087048, at *5 (S.D.W. Va. May 5, 2015). \n8 Defendant next contends that Dr. Rosenzwei g's opinions about polypropylene \ndegradation are unreliable because he has \"never done any type of degradation testing,\" his \nopinions are not peer-reviewed , and his review of literature ignored a recent publication showing \ncontrary results. (See D.I. 102 at 8-9) The Court disagrees. In reaching his opinions, Dr. \nRosenzweig adequately relied on his extensive clinical experience and his review of scientific \narticles, in which the theory of polyprop ylene degradation in vivo has been tested and reported. \n(See D.I. 122 at 10) The scientific rigor underlying Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinions -including his \npurported failure to account for more recent literature -goes to their persuasiveness , not their \nadmissibility . \nFinally, Defendant argues Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinions that Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's \nRestorelle implant degraded are unreliable because he did not examine the explanted mesh, and \nhis opinions are contradicted by Dr. V akili' s testimony. (See D .I. 102 at 10-11) Although Dr. \nRosenzweig did not examine the explanted mesh, he reviewed Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's medical \nrecord, including Dr. Vakili's operation notes. (See, e.g., id. Ex. 7 at 110-12, 139-44) This is \nsufficient grounding for Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinions -and his failures are fruitful areas for cross\u00ad\nexarnination. Likewise , the purported inconsistenc y between Dr. Rosenzweig 's interpretation of \noperation notes and Dr. Vakili's deposition testimony goes to the weight the factfinder may \naccord to the testimony but is not a meritorious basis for excluding the opinions. \nAccordingly , the Court will deny this portion of Defendant 's motion. \ne. Informed Consent \nDefendant contends that Dr. Rosenzweig is neither qualified nor has a reliable basis to \ntestify that Defendant's alleged failure to disclose the risks of the Restorelle implant in its \nInstructions for Use (\"IFU\") was a \"substantial factor and/or cause\" of Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's \n9 mJunes. (See D.I. 102 at 11-12) Defendant clarifies that, although other courts have found Dr. \nRosenzweig is qualified to opine \"generally on the adequacy of the product warnings ,\" here it \n\"challenges the reliability of Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinion as it relates to proximate causation\" in \nthis specific case. (D.I. 128 at 9-10)6 \nThis narrow portion of Defendant 's motion will be granted. The Court agrees with \nDefendant that, since Dr. Rosenzweig cannot attribute personal knowledge or a specific state of \nmind to either Ms. Godreau-Rivera or her implanting surgeon, Dr. Vakili, his opinions regarding \nthe causal relationship between the purported inadequac y of the Restorelle IFU and Ms. \nGodreau-Rivera 's lack of informed consent should be excluded. See, e.g., White v. Ethicon, Inc., \n2021 WL 129818, at *2 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 14, 2021); Sutton v. Ethicon, Inc., 2020 WL 5801049, \nat *6 (E.D. Mo. Sept. 29, 2020); Arevalo v. Coloplast Corp., 2020 WL 3958505, at* 12 (N.D. \nFla. July 7, 2020). \nf. Insufficiency Of Defendant's Testing \nDefendant seeks to exclude Dr. Rosenzweig 's opinions on Defendant's alleged \ninsufficient device testing, on the ground that he lacks the specialized training and education to \nbe qualified to offer such an opinion. (See D.I. 102 at 12-13) Plaintiffs explain that Dr. \nRosenzweig will not opine on the specific nature of the testing that Defendant needed to perform, \nbut will offer only the general opinion that \"Coloplast should have conducted clinically relevant \ntesting to determine if naturally occurring conditions in the vagina could cause polypropylene to \ndegrade.\" (D.I. 122 at 13) The Court will grant this portion of Defendant's motion. \n6 The Court understands that Defendant does not seek to exclude Dr. Rosenzweig's opinions on \nthe adequacy of the Restorelle IFU in general or on the general effect an inadequate IFU may \nhave on informed consent. To the extent Defendant seeks to do so, its Daubert motion on these \nissues will be denied. \n10 Dr. Rosenzweig 's expert report does not reveal any experience, education, or knowledge \nabout the appropriate testing a medical device manufacturer should perform on its mesh products \nprior to marketing. Although Plaintiffs contend that Dr. Rosenzweig \"has substantial experience \nwith testing genitourinary and pelvic medical devices\" (id), none of the listed product \ndevelopment projects Dr. Rosenzweig participated in has anything to do with mesh products or \nclinically relevant testing (see id at 13 n.2). Dr. Rosenzweig is not qualified to provide expert \nopinions on the adequacy of Defendant's testing of mesh products. See, e.g., Humleker v. Bos. \nSci. Corp., 2020 WL 6870852, at *9 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 2, 2020) (excluding Dr. Rosenzweig's \nopinion that \"Defendant should have conducted clinically relevant testing to determine if \nnaturally occurring conditions in the vagina could cause polypropylene used in Defendant's \nMesh Products to alter inside the woman's body\"). \ng. Safer Alternative Designs \nDefendant contends that the Court should exclude the opinions of Dr. Rosenzweig -and \nalso of Dr. Garely -regarding safer alternative designs for the Restorelle mesh implant, arguing \nthese opinions are \"unsupported, speculative, and irrelevant.\" (D.I. 102 at 19) According to \nDefendant, the expert opinions on this point are \"guesswork \" lacking scientific support, and the \nalternative surgical procedures and non-mesh repair products pointed to by the experts are \nirrelevant because they are not \"alternative product designs.\" (Id at 19-22) In response, \nPlaintiffs argue that Drs. Rosenzweig and Garely's experience in the medical profession enables \nthem to reliably opine on comparable design concepts and products, and that their opinions about \nsafer alternative designs -including procedures and non-mesh products -are relevant to \nPlaintiffs' claims. (See D.I. 122 at 14-15) \n11 This portion of Defendant's motion will be denied. Drs. Rosenzweig and Garely's \nopinions regarding safer alternative designs are relevant and sufficiently reliable. Under \nDelaware law, \"[i]t is legally possible for a plaintiff to prove [a] defective design even if no \nalternative design has been identified.\" Barba v. Carlson, 2014 WL 1678246, at *5 (Del. Super. \nCt. Apr. 8, 2014). This makes the opinions relevant. \nMoreover, these opinions are based on these experts' experience with mesh products and \ntheir review of medical literature and other product materials (see, e.g., D.I. 102 Ex. 6 at 15; D.I. \n123 Ex. I), and on their conclusions that the existing materials and designs of the Restorelle mesh \nimplant have contributed to complications and tissue damages (see, e.g., D.I. 102 Ex. 6 at 15; \nD.I. 122 Ex.Hat 14-16, 29-33). Defendant 's contention that injuries might still occur using an \nalternative procedure or product does not warrant the exclusion of Drs. Rosenzweig and Garely's \nopinions. (See D.I. 102 at 19; see also Dorgan v. Ethicon, Inc., 2020 WL 5367062, at *3 (W.D. \nMo. Sept. 8, 2020)) The challenges to the scientific rigor ofDrs. Rosenzweig and Garely's \nopinions (see D.I. 102 at 19-20) go to the weight the factfinder may choose to give these \nopinions, not their admissibility. \n2. Garely \na. Defective Design Of Restorelle \nDefendant seeks to exclude Dr. Garely's opinions regarding the defective design of the \nRestorelle mesh implant, first contending that Dr. Garely does not have the requisite \nqualifications because he \"concedes he is not an expert in design and admits he has no \nknowledge about the design of mesh devices beyond his experience as a urogynecologist .\" (D.I. \n102 at 14) The Court disagrees. Dr. Garely is board certified in obstetrics, gynecology, and \nfemale pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and he has significant experience with pelvic \n12 reparr surgery. He has personally examined , diagnosed , and treated over 100 patients with mesh \ncomplications. He has also authored multiple peer-reviewed articles, including articles relating \nto mesh products, and four book chapters on pelvic floor disorders. (See D.I. 122 Ex.Hat 1-5) \nHis experience in pelvic floor surgery and his familiarity with the complications caused by mesh \nproducts render him qualified to provide opinions on the design of mesh products. \nDefendant next argues Dr. Garely cannot opine that the Restorelle implant has a \n\"defective design\" because that opinion \"impinges upon the province of the jury to make \nfindings of fact.\" (D.I. 102 at 14) An expert opinion \"is not objectionable just because it \nembraces an ultimate issue.\" Fed. R. Evid. 704. Defendant also insists that Dr. Garely's \nopinions relating to the design features of the Restorelle implant are unreliable because they are \nnot \"based on the methods and procedures of science.\" (D.I. 102 at 15) The Court, however, \nfinds that Dr. Garely's opinions are well-grounded in both his clinical experience in treating \nmesh complications (see D.I. 122 Ex.Hat 1-5), and in his review of Defendant 's internal \ndocuments on mesh products (see D.I. 123 Ex. I). \nHence, this portion of Defendant 's motion will be denied. \nb. Adequacy Of Defendant's IFUs \nDefendant seeks to exclude Dr. Garely's opinions regarding the adequacy of its IFUs. \n(See D.I. 102 at 15-17) According to Defendant , since Dr. Garely, by his own admission , is not \nan expert in the areas of product warnings , product labeling, or regulation compliance, he cannot \noffer opinions about \"what an IFU should or should not include,\" or \"whether an IFU complies \nwith regulatory standard.\" In re C.R. Bard, Inc., Pelvic Repair Sys. Prods. Liab. Litig., 2018 WL \n4212409, at *4 (S.D.W. Va. Sept. 4, 2018); see also In re Ethicon Inc. Pelvic Repair Sys. Prod \nLiab. Litig., 2016 WL 4582209 , at *3 (S.D.W. Va. Sept. 1, 2016). \n13 Plaintiffs counter that Dr. Garely's undisputed expertise in female pelvic health and \nreconstructive surgery makes him \"fully qualified to opine on the medical facts and science \nregarding the risks and benefits of drugs and to compare that knowledge with what was provided \nin the text of labeling and warnings .\" In re Yasmin & YAZ (Drospirenone ) Mktg., Sales \nPractices , & Prods. Liab. Litig., 2011 WL 6301625, at *11-13 (S.D. Ill. Dec. 16, 2011); see also \nHuskey v. Ethicon, Inc., 29 F. Supp. 3d, 691, 719 (S.D.W. Va. 2014) (finding urologist qualified \nto testify about risks of implanting product and whether those risks were adequately expressed on \nproduct's IFU). \nIn the Court's view, the parties' competing positions are not truly conflicting. The Court \nfinds the reasoning in Wise v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 2015 WL 521202, at *14 (S.D.W. Va. Feb. 7, \n2015), instructive here: \nI have concluded that although Dr. Ostergard is not qualified to \nopine on FDA regulations and whether a product label satisfies \nthose regulations, he is qualified to evaluate Bard's warnings based \non his knowledge of and experience with the risks of the \nA vaulta. . . . I reach the same conclusion with respect to Dr. \nRaybon. Dr. Raybon has no demonstrated experience in the \nrequirements for product labeling, and as such, he may not testify \nas to what the A vaulta label should or should not have included \nunder the law. However , as an experienced urogynecologist , he \nmay testify about the risks he perceives that the A vaulta poses to \npatients and then opine that the A vaulta IFU did not convey those \nrisks. \nThe court in Arevalo, 2020 WL 3958505, at *5, embraced the same analysis: \nThe Court finds that Dr. Garely is qualified to testify about the \nrisks associated with the device and whether those risks were \nadequately expressed in the device's IFU, how physicians use \nIFUs, and the type of information typically included in IFUs, but \nhe is not qualified to opine on whether an IFU complies with \nregulatory standards . \n14 The Court will adopt the same approach here. Dr. Garely will be permitted to offer \nopinions as to whether Defendant 's IFUs provided adequate information about the risks \nassociated with mesh implants, but he may not offer opinions as to what Defendant was, for \nexample, \"obligated\" to include in its IFUs. (See, e.g., D.I. 122 Ex. Hat 23) (\"If Coloplast knew \nor believed ... , it was obligated to so advise the physician users of the products.\") \nAccomplishing this result means granting in part and denying part this portion of Defendant 's \nmotion. \nc. General Causation \nDefendant contends that Dr. Garely's general causation opinions should be excluded \nbecause they are not based on either \"sufficient facts and data\" or \"reliable principles and \nmethods.\" (D.I. 102 at 17) According to Defendant , Dr. Garely's \"personal experience with the \nRestorelle is virtually non-existent ,\" adding that the publications on which his opinions rely are \nnot \"specific to Restorelle. \" (Id. at 17-18) \nThis portion of Defendant's motion will be denied because the Court finds Dr. Garely's \ngeneral causation opinions are sufficiently reliable. In his report, Dr. Garely states that his \ngeneral causation opinions are based on his personal observation and treatment of \"patients that \nhave experienced ... complications associated to the transvaginal placement of polypropylene \npelvic organ prolapse mesh,\" and \"[t]he published medical literature [that] reports these same \ntypes of complications.\" (D.I. 122 Ex.Hat 35-36) While Dr. Garely may not have personal \nexperience with the Restorelle product specifically, he has extensive clinical experience with \npolypropylene-containing pelvic mesh products generally. It is not unreliable for him to \nextrapolate his observations of the complications associated with polypropylene-containing \npelvic mesh products in general to those associated specifically with the Restorelle implant. (See \n15 D.I. 122 at 21; see also D.I. 123 Ex. J at 299-300 (\"I don't know necessarily what [mesh \nproducts the patients] have. It doesn't change the approach or the outcome. \")) The scientific \nrigor of Dr. Garely's opinions is a proper subject for cross-examination and presents an issue \ngoing to the weight, not the admissibility , of the opinions. \nd. FDA's Position On Surgical Mesh Products \nDefendant seeks to preclude Dr. Garely from testifying about the FDA's position on \nsurgical mesh products. (See D .I. 102 at 18) At deposition , Dr. Garely repeatedly asserted that \n\"the FDA agrees\" with his opinions on the use of surgical mesh implants for transvaginal repair \nof pelvic organ prolapse. (See, e.g., id. Ex. 2 at 58) (\"I do not believe them to be safe, and this is \nwhy I don't, and I have been now validated , I guess, by the FDA, who also does not believe them \nto be safe.\") Defendant contends that Dr. Garely is not qualified to render an opinion on the \nFDA' s position and that his opinions on this topic are irrelevant and unhelpful. (See id. at 18-19) \nPlaintiffs acknowledge Dr. Garely \"does not opine that he is an FDA regulatory process expert, \nnor does he set forth the FDA's position on surgical mesh,\" but insist that Dr. Garely should be \npermitted to testify that \"he and the FDA are in agreement on the safety of transvaginal mesh \nproducts.\" (D.I. 122 at 22) \nThis portion of Defendant 's motion will be granted. Dr. Garely will be precluded from \ntestifying about the FDA's position on surgical mesh products, including that \"he and the FDA \nare in agreement.\" He is not qualified to render opinions about the FDA's position.7 \n7 Whether the jury will hear anything about the FDA's position is not the subject of any pending \nmotion. If Plaintiffs have some other witness through whom they believe they can admit such \nevidence , this issue may become the subject of a motion in limine or an objection at trial. \n16 3. Michaels \nDefendant seeks to exclude Dr. Michaels ' opinions that Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's Restorelle \nmesh implant caused a fibrotic reaction that resulted in her \"pelvic pain, irritative bladder \nsymptoms, and dyspareunia .\" (D.I. 102 at 22) Defendant first contends that Dr. Michaels is not \nqualified to offer opinions on the causation of clinical complications because, as a pathologist , he \n\"does not counsel or treat any patients.\" (Id. at 23) The Court concludes , however, that Dr. \nMichaels possesses sufficientl y appropriate qualifications. Dr. Michaels is board certified in \nanatomic pathology , clinical pathology , and cytopathology , with a \"strong subspecialty focus in \nbreast and gynecology pathology , as well as cytopathology .\" (Id. Ex. 17 at 1) \"Part of \npathology involves reaching a diagnosis through clinical and pathologic correlation. \" Sanchez v. \nBos. Sci. Corp., 2014 WL 4851989, at *20 (S.D.W. Va. Sept. 29, 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In the Court's view, Dr. Michaels ' understanding and application of clinical pathology \n\"qualify him to opine on the causal relationship between transvaginal mesh implantation and \ntissue response.\" Id.; see also e.g., Townsendv. Ethicon, Inc., 2021 WL 304555, at *1 (D. Nev. \nJan 29, 2021) (\"Dr. Michaels is qualified as a pathologist to opine that there is no other \npathological cause for [the plaintiff's] injuries following a review of her medical records and \nexamination of specimens of the mesh and her tissue.\"); Eghnayem v. Bos. Sci. Corp., 57 F. \nSupp. 3d 658, 712 (S.D.W. Va. 2014) (\"A pathologist is a clinician who provides diagnoses for \npatient care based on the examination of specimens they receive and relevant clinical \ninformation.\"). \nDefendant next contends that Dr. Michaels ' causation opinions are unreliable because he \n\"ignores Restorelle ' s distinct properties , as well as the research showing different tissue \nresponse. \" (D.I. 102 at 24) The Court disagrees. During deposition, Dr. Michaels testified, \n17 contrary to Defendant's contention , that he reviewed literature specifically concerning the \nRestorelle mesh implant. (See D.I. 123 Ex.Lat 18-19) Dr. Michaels also explained that his \nopinions would not differ in a Restorelle case from those in cases involving other polypropylene \nmesh products. (See D.I. 122 at 24; see also D.I. 123 Ex.Lat 68) Additionally , Dr. Michaels \nstates in his report that he reviewed Ms. Godreau-Ri vera's medical records and evaluated slides \nprepared from her vaginal mesh pathology specimen. (See D.I. 102 Ex. 17 at 1) Dr. Michaels \nalso considered and ruled out several alternative causes. (See Tr. at 56; see also D.I. 102 Ex. 17 \nat 8) Thus, Dr. Michaels ' specific causation opinions are based on reliable pathological \nmethodology. \nDefendant 's challenges with respect to the scientific soundness of Dr. Michaels ' \nopinions, including the alleged failure to account for the characteristics of Restorelle (see D.I. \n128 at 14-15), and the purported insufficienc y of Dr. Michaels ' differential diagnosis (see Tr. at \n59-62), go to the weight the factfinder may accord to Dr. Michaels' opinions, not their \nadmissibility. See, e.g., Tucker v. Ethicon, Inc., 2021 WL 825921, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 4, 2021) \n(\"Dr. Michaels' case-specific opinions appear to be grounded on his general opinions and his \nreview of Plaintiffs medical history, tissue samples, and explanted pelvic mesh. These are \nsufficiently reliable for purposes of Daubert, even if Dr. Michaels did not use a control \nsample.\"); Townsend, 2021 WL 304555, at *1 (\"Dr. Michaels reviewed [the plaintiffs] medical \nrecords, slides of tissue specimens explanted from [the plaintiff], internal Ethicon documents , \nscientific literature, and deposition testimony from this case. . . . The defendants' challenges go \nto the weight of Dr. Michaels ' testimony , not its admissibility , and the defendants may cross \nexamine him on these points.\"). Accordingly , this portion of Defendant's motion will be denied. \n18 4. Mays \na. Polypropylene Degradation In Vivo \nDefendant contends that Dr. Mays' opinions regarding the degradation of polypropylene \nin vivo should be excluded because he \"wholly ignores one of the principal findings of the peer\u00ad\nreviewed published paper.\" (D.I. 102 at 26) This portion of Defendant 's motion will be denied. \nDr. Mays' opinions on polyprop ylene degradation in vivo are sufficiently reliable. Dr. \nMays did not \"wholly ignore\u008f\" the Thames study; instead, he specificall y addressed that study in \nhis expert report. (See D.I. 123 Ex.Mat 25-26) Dr. Mays explained that he did not credit the \nfindings of the Thames study because he relied on the Thompson study, which criticizes the \n\"extreme procedure \" used in the Thames study. (See D.I. 122 at 27; see also D.I. 123 Ex.Mat \n25-26) This dispute does not provide a basis for excluding Dr. Mays' opinions. See, e.g., \nBayless v. Bos. Sci. Corp., 2020 WL 10058191 , at *4 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 7, 2020) (\"Other scientific \nliterature that may contradict an expert's well-founded opinions is certainly fertile ground for \ncross-examination. \"). \nb. Degradation of Defendant's Polypropylene Mesh Products \nDefendant first contends that Dr. Mays' opinions regarding the degradation of \nDefendant 's polypropylene mesh products in vivo are unreliable because he \"misstates the \nliterature upon which he relies.\" (D.I. 102 at 30) In Defendant's view, Dr. Mays' assumption -\nthat \"the body continually releases high concentrations of oxidizing agents for the entire duration . \nthe implant remains in the body\" -is not supported by the literature cited in his report. (See id.) \nIn response, Plaintiffs insist that, since the cited studies show the release of oxidizing agents \n\"only decreases over time,\" and do not suggest \"there [are] no oxidizing agents being \ngenerated, \" these studies are not inconsistent with Dr. Mays' opinions regarding the continuous \n19 release of oxidizing agents and persistent foreign body response. (See D.I. 122 at 29; see also \nD.I. 123 Ex.Nat 233-34) The parties' competing interpretations of scientific studies, as well as \ntheir conflicting positions over whether these studies support the factual predicate of Dr. Mays' \nopinions on polypropylene degradation in vivo, present a dispute to be resolved by the factfinder \nand go to the weight, not the admissibility , of these opinions. See, e.g., Nunez v. Coloplast \nCorp., 2020 WL 2315077, at *4 (S.D. Fla. May 11, 2020) (\"[A]s to the argument that there are \nauthorities that 'flatly contradict ' Dr. Mays's opinions, ... this [is] an issue that goes to weight \nand credibility. \"). \nDefendant also contends that Dr. Mays' opinions are unreliable because he relied on an \narticle containing the testing data he had included in his expert report submitted in a different \nMDL, a report which \"was excluded on several occasions,\" and he failed to account for some \n\"key differences \" between the polypropylene mesh products made by other manufacturers and \nthe ones made by Defendant. (D.I. 102 at 31) In the Court's view, however, Dr. Mays' opinions \n-which are based on his experience , training, and education in polymer science, and his review \nof scientific literature and documents on Defendant's polypropylene mesh products (see D.I. 122 \nat 28) -are sufficiently reliable to meet the requirements of Rule 702. The purported differences \nbetween Defendant's polypropylene products and those of other manufacturers do not render Dr. \nMays' opinions unreliable . See In re Ethicon Inc. Pelvic Repair Sys. Prod. Liab. Litig., 2016 \nWL 4958282, at *2 (S.D.W. Va. Aug. 25, 2016) (\"I disagree that the supposed distinction \nbetween Prolene specifically and polypropylene generally renders studies on the latter unhelpful \nwhen discussing the former.\") . Accordingly , this portion of Defendant's motion will be denied. \n20 c. Linking Degradation To Medical Complaints \nDefendant contends Dr. Mays is not qualified to offer opinions regarding the medical \ncomplications allegedly caused by the degradation of polypropylene mesh. (See D.I. 102 at 32) \nPlaintiffs counter that Dr. Mays, a polymer expert with expertise in biomaterials , should be \nallowed to opine on \"the clinical significance of [polypropylene] degradation. \" (D.I. 122 at 31) \nDuring oral argument , Plaintiffs clarified that Dr. Mays would only offer \"general opinions \nabout ... the producing of a tissue response to the oxidizing of the polypropylene in the tissue;\" \nhe will not testify to \"something of clinical significance specifically in [Ms. Godreau-Rivera ]\" or \n\"what the patient would subjectively experience. \" (Tr. at 70-71) The Court will deny this \nportion of Defendant 's motion. \nDr. Mays' extensive experience in polymer science, and particularly in biomaterials , \nrenders him qualified to testify generally about tissue responses caused by oxidative degradation \nof polypropylene mesh products, even though he is not a medical doctor and does not examine or \ntreat patients. See, e.g., Nunez, 2020 WL 2315077 , at *3; Wise, 2015 WL 521202, at *9. \nd. Oxidative Degradation Results In Reduction Of \nMechanical Properties Of Surgical Mesh Implants \nDefendant seeks to exclude Dr. Mays' opinions that oxidative degradation results in a \nbreakdown of mechanical properties of polyprop ylene mesh products , on the grounds that (1) Dr. \nMays is not qualified to quantify the breakdown of mechanical properties , and (2) his opinions \nare based on an assumption unsupported by any published study. (See D.I. 102 at 33) This \nportion of Defendant's motion will be denied. \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Dr. Mays possesses the requisite qualifications and \nthat his opinions are sufficiently reliable. Dr. Mays' inability to quantify the degree of \nmechanical breakdown does not prevent him from providing opinions , in a qualitative sense, that \n21 reduction in mechanical properties and increase in stiffness of the polypropylene mesh products \noccur. (See D.I. 122 at 32; see also Arevalo, 2020 WL 3958505, at *8) Dr. Mays' opinions rest \non a reliable foundation as they are based on his extensive experience in polymer science and his \nreview of scientific publications. The fact that he was not able to point to a specific article \ndemonstrating a breakdown in mechanical properties of the polypropylene mesh products goes to \nthe weight, not the admissibility, of his opinions. \ne. Medical Safety Data Sheets \nDefendant first contends that Dr. Mays should be precluded from giving opinions on the \nalleged toxicity or irritability of polypropylene resin or antioxidants. (See D.I. 102 at 33-34) \nThis portion of Defendant 's motion will be granted. The Court agrees with Defendant that since \nDr. Mays is not a toxicologist , he is not qualified to offer opinions on the toxicity of materials. \nSee, e.g., Arevalo, 2020 WL 3958505, at *8; Bayless, 2020 WL 10058191 , at *5. \nDefendant next seeks to exclude Dr. Mays' opinions on the oxidative degradation of the \nfinished products in vivo, arguing that the information on the Medical Safety Data Sheets \n(\"MSDS\") for raw materials is not a reliable basis for Dr. Mays' opinions with respect to the \nfinished products. (See D.I. 102 at 34) This portion of Defendant's motion will be denied. Dr. \nMays has adequately explained the connection between the MSDS for raw materials and his \nopinions on the oxidative degradation of the finished products. (See D.I. 123 Ex.Mat 29-34) \nThus, his reliance on the raw materials MSDS does not render his opinions regarding the finished \nproducts unreliable. See, e.g., Arevalo, 2020 WL 3958505, at *8; Wise, 2015 WL 521202, at \n* 11. Defendant's criticisms on these points go to the weight and not the admissibility of these \nOplillons. \n22 Defendant also seeks to exclude Dr. Mays' testimony that \"impermissibly inject[s] \ncorporate state of mind or intent.\" (D.I. 102 at 34) Since Plaintiffs agree that Dr. Mays will not \ntestify on Defendant 's \"state of mind, corporate conduct, and legal conclusions \" (D.I. 122 at 33), \nthis portion of Defendant 's motion is moot and, therefore , will be denied. \n5. Pence \na. Adequacy Of Restorelle IFU \nDefendant contends that Dr. Pence's opinions regarding the adequacy of the IFU for \nDefendant 's Restorelle mesh product are unreliable . (See D.I. 102 at 35) Plaintiffs fail to \naddress Defendant 's challenge in their brief and conceded during oral argument that \"[t]hose \nportions of her opinions have been excluded by other courts, and we would be fine with [the \nCourt] applying those rulings here as well.\" (Tr. at 85-86) This portion of Defendant 's motion \nwill be granted. \nb. Adequacy Of Defendant's Premarket Testing \nDefendant seeks to exclude Dr. Pence's premarket testing opinions, contending these \nopinions are unreliable because Dr. Pence failed to support them \"with any regulatory \nrequirements or other binding authority .\" (D.I. 102 at 37) Defendant particularly points out that \ninternational bodies -including the Global Harmonization Task Force (\"GHTF\"), certain French \nand British authorities , and industry groups -are not responsible for medical device regulation in \nthe United States. (See id. at 38) Plaintiffs respond that the non-binding nature of the standards \nrelied on by Dr. Pence does not render her opinions unreliable. (See D.I. 122 at 35-37) This \nportion of Defendant 's motion will be denied. \nDr. Pence has extensive experience in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries , \nand her testing opinions are based on \"multiple sources that stress the importance of running \n23 clinical trials before incorporating mesh materials into a surgical product.\" Sanchez, 2014 WL \n4851989, at *34. Contrary to Defendant's contention, the non-binding nature of industry \nstandards does not compel a conclusion that Dr. Pence's premarket testing opinions based on \nthem are unreliable. See Heatherly v. Bos. Sci. Corp., 2018 WL 3797507, at *5-6 (S.D.W. Va. \nAug. 9, 2018); see also Lees v. Carthage Coll., 714 F.3d 516, 525 (7th Cir. 2013) (finding that \nwhether international guidelines are controlling in industry is not \"the relevant question for \nadmissibility purposes\"). \nThe Court is further unpersuaded by Defendant's argument that Dr. Pence's opinions are \nunreliable because she \"simply summarizes comments from various sources about clinical \ntesting and then jumps to her opinion that Coloplast's device testing was inadequate.\" (D.I. 102 \nat 39) By relying on her review of a voluminous amount of peer-reviewed scientific articles, \ndeposition testimony, government codes and regulations, clinical trial materials, and Defendant's \ninternal documents , Dr. Pence has sufficiently demonstrated that her opinions are a product of a \nsoundly grounded methodology. (See generally D.I. 124 Ex.Pat 82-113) \nc. Adequacy Of Post-Market Surveillance \nPlaintiffs do not address this issue in their brief and conceded during oral argument that \nthe Court can apply the rulings of other courts that have excluded Dr. Pence's post-market \nsurveillance opinions. (See Tr. at 85-86) The Court will grant this portion of Defendant's \nmotion. \n24 B. Motion For Summary Judgment8 \n1. Claims Based On Specific Causation \nThis portion of Defendant's motion for summary judgment is based solely on Plaintiffs' \nsupposed inability to adduce expert evidence to establish specific causation. (See D.I. 102 at 42) \nIn other words, the motion turns entirely on Defendant 's related Daubert motions. As the Court \nhas denied the pertinent portions of those Daubert motions -and has ruled that Drs. Rosenzweig \nand Michaels' specific causation opinions are admissible -Defendant's motion for summary \njudgment with respect to all of Plaintiffs ' claims based on specific causation will be denied. \n2. Negligent Failure To Warn (Part Of Count I) \nThe parties agree that Delaware 's \"learned intermediary \" doctrine applies to Plaintiffs' \nnegligent failure to warn claim. (See D.I. 102 at 44; D.I. 122 at 42) \"The learned intermediary \ndoctrine provides for an exception to the general rule that a manufacturer of a [ medical device] \nowes a duty to warn the consumer directly concerning the risks associated with the [device].\" \nLacy v. G.D. Searle & Co., 567 A.2d 398, 399 (Del. 1989). The doctrine \"acts as an affirmative \ndefense.\" Hagan v. Bos. Sci. Corp., 2021 WL 1921893, at *6 (Del. Super. Ct. May 12, 2021). \nHence, a manufacturer of a prescription medical device satisfies its duty to provide an \nappropriate warning about the device \"when it gives the patient's physician the necessary \ninformation to be disseminated to the patient.\" Lacy, 567 A.2d at 399. The \"learned \nintermediary\" doctrine is inapplicable if a warning is \"inadequate as a matter of law.\" Evans v. \n8 Defendant has moved for summary judgment on \"all of Plaintiffs' claims.\" (D.I. 102 at 40) \nPlaintiffs indicate in their brief that they will not pursue the following claims: manufacturing \ndefect (Count III and part of Count I), fraudulent concealment (Count VIII), constructive fraud \n(Count IX), discovery rule, tolling and fraudulent concealment (Count X), negligent infliction of \nemotional distress (Count XII), unjust enrichment (Count XV), and all strict liability claims \n(Counts II-V). (See D.I. 122 at 40-42) Accordingl y, the Court will grant Defendant's motion for \nsummary judgment with respect to these claims. \n25 Johnson & Johnson Co., 2020 WL 616575, at *4 (D. Del. Feb. 10, 2020) (quoting Barba, 2014 \nWL 1678246, at *2). If the warning is not insufficient as a matter of law, the issue proceeds to \n\"whether additional information or warnings would have made a difference to a reasonable \nlearned intermediary.\" Barba, 2014 WL 1678246, at *3. \"If the warnings and information are \nfound to be adequate, and additional warnings or information would not have affected the \nmedical decisions of a reasonable physician, then the learned intermediary insulates the \nmanufacturer from liability.\" Id. \nDefendant contends that its motion for summary judgment should be granted because \n(1) the warning Defendant provided to Ms. Godreau-Rivera's prescribing and implanting \nphysician, Dr. Vakili, is adequate (see D.I. 102 at 44-45); and (2) Plaintiffs cannot establish \nproximate causation, since Dr. V akili was \"independently aware of the potential risks\" for which \nPlaintiffs now seek recovery and a differently-worded warning would not have changed Dr. \nVakili's prescribing decision (see id. at 45-47). Plaintiffs dispute both grounds. (See D.I. 122 at \n43-47) They further contend that Dr. Vakili's \"financial bias\" creates fact issues precluding \nsummary judgment. (See id. at 4 7-49) \nThe Court finds there is a genuine dispute of material fact over both the adequacy of the \nwarning and proximate cause. A reasonable juror, taking all the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiffs and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, could find that the \nwarning Defendant provided to \"learned intermediaries \" like Dr. V akili was insufficient and, \nadditionally , could also find that a different warning could have caused Dr. Vakili to act \nmaterially differently. Accordingly, and as more fully set out below, Defendant 's motion for \nsummary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs ' negligent failure to warn claim will be denied. \n26 a. Adequacy Of Warning \nDefendant argues \"the undisputed record evidence establishes that Coloplast provided \naccurate, clear, and unambiguous warnings about the potential risks associated with Restorelle in \nthe accompanying IFU.\" (D.I. 102 at 44) In particular , Defendant insists that the Restorelle IFU \nwarned of each of the risks of developing each of the problems Ms. Godreau-Rivera has \nallegedly suffered. (See id. at 45) Relying primarily on Dr. Rosenzweig 's expert report, \nPlaintiffs counter that Defendant 's IFU \"did not include sufficient information to advise \nphysicians on the permanency , frequency , and severity of the complications that can arise from \nthe use of its devices,\" and further that Defendant \"significantly downplayed the risks that it \nactually did list in its IFU.\" (D.I. 122 at 43-44; see also id. Ex. F at 43-48) In its reply brief, \nDefendant argues that \"so long as the manufacturer warned the physician about the injuries \nplaintiff complained of, the learned intermediary doctrine bars a failure-to-warn claim as a matter \noflaw,\" citing Lacy, 567 A.2d at 401. (D.I. 128 at 22) \nDefendant's reliance on Lacy is misplaced . Lacy does not hold that a medical device \nprovider's obligation to warn a learned intermediary is discharged as long as the label mentions \nthe types of injury of which a plaintiff complains , regardless of the injury's \"permanency , \nfrequency , and severity.\" Moreover, here the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that they have \nintroduced sufficient evidence -including expert opinions the Court has found admissible -to \ncreate a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the warnings provided by the Restorelle \nIFU are adequate. See Hagan, 2021 WL 1921893, at *6 (\"The issue of whether adequate \nwarnings were issued is factual and is usually resolved by the trier of fact.\"). \n27 b. Proximate Cause \nDefendant first contends that, prior to Ms. Godreau-Ri vera's implantation surgery, Dr. \nVakili was independently aware of the \"well-publicized \" risks associated with Restorelle. (See \nD.I. 102 at 45-46) According to Defendant , this independent knowledge was obtained, at least in \npart, \"through reading medical literature and FDA safety communications .\" (Id at 46) The \nrecord, however, reveals a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the risks about \nRestorelle known to Dr. V akili at the pertinent time would include the risks that Dr. Rosenzweig \nopines should have been included in the Restorelle IFU. \nDefendant further argues that a differentl y-worded warning would not have changed Dr. \nVakili's prescribing decision. (See id at 46-47) The Court finds, however , a genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact as to whether Dr. V akili' s prescribing decision would have remained the same had \nhe received additional warnings about the fitness of Restorelle for human implantation. Dr. \nV akili testified at his deposition : \nQ: Yeah. If the company told you that polypropylene is not \nmeant for human -permanent human implantation , would \nyou continue to use polypropylene mesh? \nA: I have to think about the answer to that question because it \nseems a little leading. So if the company said \npolyprop ylene as a material is not meant for human \nconsumption ? \nQ: Implantation ? \nA: Implantation . If I was told that by the company , would I \nnot use it? \nQ: Yes. \nA: I would take it into consideration, but I'm not sure it \nwould totally inform my decision. \nQ: Why wouldn't it totally inform your decision? \n28 A: Because I would look at the body of medical literature that \nexists regarding products of that material before I made a \nfinal decision. \n(D.I. 124 Ex. Q at 129-30) (emphasis added) Since Dr. Vakili did not unequivocally state that he \nwould not have changed his prescribing decision, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Dr. \nV akili -after taking \"into consideration \" the hypothesized manufacturer warnings that \npolypropylene mesh is unfit for human implantation -may have come to a different prescribing \ndecision. See, e.g., Humleker, 2020 WL 6870852, at *16 (denying motion for summary \njudgment when implanting physician suggested that \"she would have wanted additional \ninformation\" regarding the safety of implanting polypropylene in human body). \nThe situation here is distinguishable from those presented in cases cited by Defendant \n(see D.I. 128 at 25), in which courts granted motions for summary judgment when physicians \nprovided unequivocal testimony that they would not have changed their prescribing decisions -\ntestimony Dr. Vakili did not give in this case.9 Thus, the genuine factual dispute over proximate \ncause provide a further basis for denying Defendant 's motion for summary judgment with \nrespect to Plaintiffs ' negligent failure to warn claim.10 \n9 In supplemental authority submitted by Defendant (see D.I. 136), Salinero v. Johnson & \nJohnson, 995 F.3d 959,966 (11th Cir. 2021), the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's \ngrant of summary judgment to a defendant based, in part, on the implanting physician being \n\"clear that an IFU containing more information on the risks posed by Artisyn Y-Mesh would not \nhave altered his decision to use the implant in [the plaintiff's] surgery.\" This authority does not \nhelp Defendant because the record is devoid of such a statement by Dr. V akili. \n10 The Court need not reach Plaintiffs ' additional argument that Dr. Vakili's financial bias \ncreates fact issues precluding summary judgment. (See D.I. 122 at 47-49) \n29 3. Breach Of Express Warranty (Count VI) \nUnder Delaware law, to prevail on a breach of express warranty claim, \"the buyer must \nprove: (1) the existence of an express ... warranty , (2) a breach of the defendant's express ... \nwarranty, (3) a causal connection between the defendant 's breach and the plaintiff's injury or \ndamage, and ( 4) the extent ofloss proximately caused by the defendant's breach.\" Driscoll v. \nAutomaxx, 2016 WL 5107066, at *2 (Del. Com. Pl. Apr. 27, 2016). An express warranty may \narise in three ways: \n(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the \nbuyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the \nbasis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the \ngoods shall conform to the affirmation or promise. \n(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the \nbasis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the \ngoods shall conform to the description . \n( c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the \nbargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the \ngoods shall conform to the sample or model. \n6 Del. C. \u00a7 2-313(1). Defendant contends that Plaintiffs ' breach of express warranty claim fails \nbecause there is \"no evidence that Coloplast made any express warranties to [Ms. Godreau\u00ad\nRivera] as to the safety or effectiveness of Restorelle .\" (D.I. 102 at 47) The Court agrees with \nDefendant. \nPlaintiffs ground their express warranty theory on Defendant's \"assurances to the general \npublic, hospitals, and health care professionals that its mesh products were safe and fit for their \nintended purpose.\" (D.I. 122 at 51) However , it is undisputed that Ms. Godreau-Rivera \"has \nnever had any contact or conversation with anyone from Coloplast or seen any advertisements , \nbrochures , or websites from Coloplast .\" (Compare D.I. 102 at 41 with D.I. 122 at 38; see also \nD.I. 102 at 47, id. Ex. 32 at 164, 167, 198) It follows that, therefore, Plaintiffs cannot establish \n30 Ms. Godreau-Rivera 's reliance on the purported \"assurances \" to enter into a bargain with \nDefendant. See, e.g., Barba, 2014 WL 1678246, at *5 (granting summary judgment because \nplaintiff testified \"she neither received nor relied upon any Boston Scientific materials\"); \nDilenno v. Libbey Glass Div., Owens-lll ., Inc., 668 F. Supp. 373,376 (D. Del. 1987) (holding \nthat plaintiffs claim for breach of expressed warranty must fail because \"[t]here is no evidence \nin the record to suggest that [the plaintiff] ever saw the [defendant's] catalog let alone relied on it \nwhen she purchased the [product]\") . \nThus, Defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs' breach of \nexpress warranty claim will be granted. \n4. Negligent Misrepresentation (Count XI) \nUnder Delaware law, to prove negligent misrepresentation, Plaintiffs must establish: \"(1) \na pecuniary duty to provide accurate information , (2) the supplying of false information , \n(3) failure to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating information, and (4) a \npecuniary loss caused by justifiable reliance upon the false information.\" Pa. Emp. Benefit Trust \nFund v. Zeneca, Inc., 710 F. Supp. 2d 458, 485-86 (D. Del. 2010) (citing Atwell v. RHIS, Inc., \n2006 WL 2686532, at * 1 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2006)). \nDefendant contends summary judgment is warranted because: (1) its \"pecuniary duty\" \nwas owed to Dr. V akili, and (2) Plaintiffs cannot prove Dr. V akili relied on the alleged \nmisrepresentation. (See D.I. 102 at 48-49) The Court need not address the first issue, because \neven assuming the learned intermediary doctrine is applicable to a negligent misrepresentation \nclaim, 11 the Court finds -for the same reasons provided in connection with Plaintiffs' negligent \n11 Although the Delaware Supreme Court has not directly addressed the issue, this Court has \napplied the learned intermediary doctrine to a negligent misrepresentation claim. See Evans, \n2020 WL 616575, at *3-4. \n31 failure to warn claim (see supra Part II.B.2.b)- there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to \nwhether Dr. Vakili relied on Defendant's alleged misrepresentation regarding the risks of \npolypropylene mesh implant products. Thus, Defendant 's motion for summary judgment with \nrespect to Plaintiffs ' negligent misrepresentation claim will be denied. \n5. Punitive Damages (Count XVII) \nUnder Delaware law, the availability of punitive damages turns on whether a plaintiff \nestablishes a prima facie case that Defendant exhibited a \"willful and wanton disregard for the \nsafety of others.\" Porter v. Turner, 954 A.2d 308, 312 (Del. 2008). \"For a defendant's conduct \nto be found willful or wanton, the conduct must reflect a 'conscious indifference ' or 'I don't \ncare' attitude.\" Id. (quoting Cloroben Chem. Corp. v. Comegys , 464 A.2d 887, 891 (Del. 1983)). \n\"Where the evidence only supports a negligence claim, summary judgment [ of no punitive \ndamages] is appropriate.\" Estate of Rae v. Murphy, 956 A.2d 1266, 1270 (Del. 2008). \nDefendant contends that Plaintiffs ' claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law \nbecause there is \"no record evidence demonstrating that Colop last' s conduct was willful or \nwanton, thus reflecting a 'conscious indifference ' or an 'I don't care attitude ' required to support \npunitive damages\" (D.I. 102 at 50) The Court, however, agrees with Plaintiffs that there is \nsufficient evidence in the record from which a reasonable factfinder could find that Defendant's \nalleged misconduct was based on a mens rea constituting a \"conscious indifference\" or \"I don't \ncare\" attitude. (See D.I. 122 at 53-54) (citing evidence) For example, Dr. Rosenzweig points out \nthat \"as early as 2011 Coloplast was being advised by a third-party polymer company about \npolypropylene degradation and stiffening. Coloplast was advised to consider abandoning the use \nof polypropylene in TVM all together.\" (Id. Ex.Eat 22) A reasonable factfinder could find that \nDefendant acted with a state of mind worse than mere negligence , warranting imposition of \n32 punitive damages. Accordingly, the Court will deny Defendant's motion for summary judgment \nwith respect to punitive damages. \nC. Waiver \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendant failed to raise the following issues in the MDL motions \nand, thus, has waived them: \n[1] it did not move to exclude the entirety of Dr. Rosenzweig's \nspecific causation opinions; [2] it did not move on Dr. Garely's \nmesh design opinions or his qualifications to opine on the \nadequacy of the warnings; [3] it did not challenge Dr. Mays' \nqualifications on the material safety data sheet. \n(D.I. 122 at 55) In response, Defendant shows that it has, in fact, raised the identified issues \nconcerning Drs. Garely and Mays in their MDL motions. (See D.I. 128 at 30 (citing D.I. 129 \nExs. 9-10)) The parties' dispute with respect to waiver, then, is limited to Dr. Rosenzweig 's \nspecific causation opinions. Because the Court has addressed the merits of this portion of \nDefendant 's Daubert motion- and, as explained above (see supra Part II.A.I.a), is denying this \nportion of the motion on the merits -the Court need not address the waiver issue. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order follows. \n33 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nROSARIO GODREAU-RlVERA and \nJOSE RIVERA-KERCADO , \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nCOLOPLAST CORP., \nDefendant. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 14th day of April, 2022: C.A.
