(D.I. 48). The motion is fully briefed. (D.I. \n49, 55, 60). For the reasons set forth below, this motion is GRANTED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs Genzyme Corporation and Aventis sued Defendants Novartis Gene Therapies , \nNovartis Pharmaceuticals , and Novartis AG for patent infringement. Novartis Gene Therapies is \nthe division that makes the accused product, Zolgensma. (D.I. 55 at 3). Novartis Pharmaceuticals \nis the U.S. parent of Novartis Gene Therapies (D.I. 17 ,r 5). Novartis AG is the overarching \nSwiss parent. (D.I. 17,r 6). In the Defendants ' answer to the complaint, Defendant Novartis AG \nasserted lack of personal jurisdiction as an affirmative defense. (D.I. 18 at 32). The parties \ndiscussed stipulating to the dismissal of Novartis AG but were unable to reach an agreement. \n(D.I. 49 at 1-2). Novartis AG then filed this motion. \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), a party may move to dismiss a case \nbased on the court's lack of personal jurisdiction over that party. Because all claims in this suit \nare for patent infringement , Federal Circuit law controls the personal jurisdiction analysis. \nPennington Seed, Inc. v. Produce Exch. No. 299,457 F.3d 1334, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Under \nFederal Circuit law, \nwhere the district court's disposition as to the personal jurisdictional question is \nbased on affidavits and other written materials in the absence of an evidentiary \nhearing, a plaintiff need only to make a prima facie showing that defendants are \nsubject to personal jurisdiction. In the procedural posture of a motion to dismiss, a \ndistrict court must accept the uncontroverted allegations in the plaintiffs complaint \nas true and resolve any factual conflicts in the affidavits in the plaintiffs favor. \nElecs. for Imaging, Inc. v. Coyle, 340 F.3d 1344, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). \n2 Personal jurisdiction can be waived by any legal arrangement that demonstrates a party's \nexpressed or implied consent to that jurisdiction. Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie \ndes Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702-04 (1982). Determining whether a corporation \nconsented to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of a particular state is a matter to be \ndetermined by examination of the law of that state. Acorda Therapeutics , Inc. v. Mylan Pharm. \nInc., 78 F. Supp. 3d 572, 584 (D. Del. 2015), aff'd, 817 F.3d 755 (Fed. Cir. 2016). In Delaware , \nconsent may be implicit if a party has filed a related suit with a \"logical relationship \" to the suit \nin question. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. v. Metallgesellschaft AG, 1993 WL 669447, at *4 (D. \nDel. Feb. 7, 2013). \nIn the absence of consent, \"[ d]etermining whether personal jurisdiction exists over an \nout-of-state defendant involves two inquiries: whether a forum state's long-arm statute permits \nservice of process, and whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would violate due process.\" \n!named Corp. v. Kuzmak, 249 F.3d 1356, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Delaware's long-arm statute \n\"has been broadly construed to confer jurisdiction to the maximum extent possible under the Due \nProcess Clause.\" LaNuova D & B, Sp.A. v. Bowe Co., 513 A.2d 764, 768 (Del. 1986). However , \nthe personal jurisdictional analysis \"must not be collapsed into a single constitutional inquiry.\" \nPower Integrations , Inc. v. BCD Semiconductor Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 365,370 n. 3 (D. Del. \n2008). \nThe Delaware long-arm statute reads, in relevant part, 1 \n( c) As to a cause of action brought by any person arising from any of the acts \nenumerated in this section, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any \nnonresident, or a personal representative, who in person or through an agent: \n1 Plaintiffs do not discuss the applicability of 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104( c )(5) and (6), so I do not \nconsider them. \n3 (1) Transacts any business or performs any character of work or service in \nthe State; \n(2) Contracts to supply services or things in this State; \n(3) Causes tortious injury in the State by an act or omission in this State; \n( 4) Causes tortious injury in the State or outside of the State by an act or \nomission outside the State if the person regularly does or solicits business, \nengages in any other persistent course of conduct in the State or derives \nsubstantial revenue from services, or things used or consumed in the State; \n10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104. Section 3 104( c )( 4) has been interpreted to confer general personal \njurisdiction , while \u00a7 3104(c)(l-3) have been interpreted as forms of specific personal \njurisdiction . Devicor Medical Products , Inc. v. Biopsy Sciences, LLC, 2013 WL 48663 8, at * 5 \n(D. Del. Feb. 7, 2013). General jurisdiction occurs where a defendant's contacts with a state are \n\"so continuous and systematic as to render it essentially at home in the forum State.\" Daimler \nAG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 127 (2014) (citation omitted). Specific jurisdiction occurs when a \ndefendant has \"purposefully directed his activities at residents of the forum, and the litigation \nresults from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities .\" Burger King Corp. v. \nRudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462,472 (1985) (citation omitted). \nSpecific personal jurisdiction may exist over a parent company by virtue of its \nsubsidiary 's actions in Delaware when the parent \"dominates and controls its subsidiary ,\" such \nthat an agency relationship exists. E.I du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Agfa-Gavaert NV, 335 F. \nSupp. 3d 657, 670 (D. Del. 2018). Under Delaware law, factors in this analysis include \"the \nextent of overlap of officers and directors , methods of financing , the division of responsibility for \nday-to-day management , and the process by which each corporation obtains its business. \" \nApplied Biosystems , Inc. v. Cruachem , Ltd., 772 F. Supp. 1458, 1463 (D. Del. 1991). However , \nthe mere incorporation of a subsidiary in Delaware is not a sufficient action for specific \n4 jurisdiction , unless the incorporation of the subsidiary is what gave rise to the lawsuit. \nAeroGlobal Capital Mgmt., LLC v. Cirrus Indus., Inc., 871 A.2d 428,439 (Del. 2005). \nFor claims arising under federal law, if a defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any \nstate's courts of general jurisdiction, a federal court may have jurisdiction if the constitutional \nrequirements for due process are satisfied with respect to the United States as a whole under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2). \nRule 4(k)(2) allows a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if (1) \nthe plaintiffs claim arises under federal law, (2) the defendant is not subject to \njurisdiction in any state's courts of general jurisdiction , and (3) the exercise of \njurisdiction comports with due process. The third requirement under Rule 4(k)(2)-\u00ad\nthe due process analysis---contemplates a defendant's contacts with the entire \nUnited States, as opposed to the state in which the district court sits. \nM-I Drilling Fluids UK Ltd. v. Dynamic Air Ltda., 890 F.3d 995,999 (Fed Cir. 2018) (citations \nomitted). \nA plaintiff may also request jurisdictional discovery. \"If a plaintiff presents factual \nallegations that suggest 'with reasonable particularity ' the possible existence of the requisite \n'contacts between the party and the forum state, the plaintiffs right to conduct jurisdictional \ndiscovery should be sustained .\"' Toys \"R\" Us, Inc. v. Step Two, SA., 318 F .3d 446, 456 (3d Cir. \n2003) (citation omitted). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Timeliness \nPlaintiffs argue that Novartis AG's motion is procedurally improper because it was filed \nafter Defendants' answer to the complaint , but too soon for any other kind of dispositive motion. \n(D.I. 55 at 6-7). Defendant notes that it asserted lack of personal jurisdiction as an affirmative \ndefense in its answer. (D.I. 60 at 1). Courts, including this Court, generally allow Rule 12(b) \nmotions filed after the answer to a complaint if the Rule 12(b) defense was raised in the answer. \n5 See, e.g., Martin v. Del. Law Sch. of Widener Univ., 625 F. Supp. 1288, 1296 n.4 (D. Del. 1985). \nSee generally SC CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND \nPROCEDURE\u00a7 1361 n.7 (3d ed. 2022). I conclude that Novartis AG's motion is procedurally \nproper. \nB. Personal Jurisdiction \n1. Consent \nPlaintiffs argue that Novartis AG has impliedly consented to jurisdiction in Delaware \nbecause it has filed a large number of lawsuits in this court. (D.I. 55 at 5). Plaintiffs assert that \nDelaware law allows the filing of lawsuits to form the basis of jurisdiction even without \"strict \nidentity between the parties.\" Id. At 12. Defendant argues that merely having filed previous \nlawsuits is not sufficient under Delaware law. Instead, the previous lawsuits would need to have \na \"logical relationship \" with the present suit. (D.I. 60 at 8). Defendant notes that Plaintiffs fail to \nargue for any logical relationship and only make an argument about the volume of litigation that \nDefendant has filed here. Id. \nI agree with Defendant. While the filing of a closely related lawsuit may indicate implied \nconsent in some cases, all the examples Plaintiffs cite either involve the same parties or arise \nfrom the same conduct. See, e.g., Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. v. Metallgesellschaft AG, 1993 \nWL 669447, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 4, 1993) (finding personal jurisdiction over countersuit \ndefendant who had filed a lawsuit against countersuit plaintiff with overlapping facts); Attorneys \nLiability Protection Society, Inc. v. Eisenhofer , 2011 WL 2089718, at *2 (Del. Super. Apr. 29, \n2011) (noting that, although plaintiff was not named in a previous class action filed in Delaware \nby defendant, \"both suits are based ... on the same transaction \"). There is no indication that any \nof the suits filed in this court by Defendant relate to any of the products, patents, or conduct at \n6 issue in the present case. The only common feature that Plaintiffs identify is that they are all \npatent suits. This is not sufficient to support consent under any case law cited by Plaintiffs . \n2. General Jurisdiction \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendant is subject to general personal jurisdiction based on its \n\"regular and persistent course of conduct in incorporating subsidiaries in Delaware and bringing \npatent infringement claims in Delaware .\" (D.I. 55 at 11). Plaintiffs assert further that while \ngeneral jurisdiction is \"usually\" found in \"the state of incorporation or primary location ,\" it \"may \nbe viewed more expansivel y if those locations do not provide a forum in which to be sued.\" (D.I. \n5 5 at 10-11 ). Defendant responds that because Delaware is neither its state of incorporation nor \nits principal place of business, general jurisdiction would only exist under \"exceptional \ncircumstances .\" (D.I. 49 at 8). Defendant argues that the facts pled by Plaintiffs do not support \nthe presence of such circumstances here. 2 Id. at 9. \nI agree with Defendant that there are no exceptional circumstances in this case and thus \nno grounds to expand general jurisdiction beyond state of incorporation or principal place of \nbusiness. The standard Plaintiffs state for expanding general jurisdiction-\"if those locations do \nnot provide a forum in which to be sued\"-appears to conflate general personal jurisdiction with \njurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2), discussed below. The remainder of \nPlaintiffs ' argument for general jurisdiction is little more than a conclusory statement of the legal \nstandard. Plaintiffs cite no cases to support the proposition that incorporating subsidiaries and \nbringing patent infringement claims, even regularly, could confer general jurisdiction . Plaintiffs \nnote that these actions are \"transaction[s] of business\" under Delaware law (D.I. 55 at 10), but at \n2 Defendant also observes that Plaintiff does not plead enough facts to support an agency theory \nof general jurisdiction . (D.I. 49 at 10). Plaintiff does not address this argument , so I will not \neither. \n7 most, individual business transactions would confer specific jurisdiction under the Delaware \nlong-arm statute. 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104(c)(l). \n3. Specific Jurisdiction \nPlaintiffs argue that because Novartis AG is \"strongly intertwined\" with Novartis Gene \nTherapies, which is incorporated in Delaware , Novartis AG is subject to specific personal \njurisdiction in Delaware . (D.I. 55 at 2). Plaintiffs point to three sets of actions as evidence of \nNovartis AG's close relationship with Novartis Gene Therapies: \"Novartis AG's procurement of \nZolgensma intellectual property, requirement that [Novartis Gene Therapies'] CEO report to \n[Novartis AG's] CEO, and its CEO's direct involvement and management of the Zolgensma \nfranchise (demonstrated at least by the fallout of the data manipulation scandal). \" (D.I. 55 at 11). \nDefendant responds that to find specific personal jurisdiction based on a subsidiary 's actions, a \nparty needs to demonstrate an agency relationship between the parent and the subsidiary , as \ndiscussed in E.I du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Afga-Gavaert, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 670. (D.I. 60 at \n6). They also note that the ownership of intellectual property is not sufficient to confer personal \njurisdiction. Id. at 5-6. \nIt is unclear whether Plaintiff is arguing that Novartis AG is subject to specific personal \njurisdiction because of its own action of incorporating a subsidiary that now produces an accused \nproduct, or that Novartis AG is subject to specific personal jurisdiction via the actions of its \nsubsidiary in Delaware. In any case, neither argument succeeds. As to the first, the incorporation \nof a subsidiary can only serve as a basis for personal jurisdiction \"where the underlying cause of \naction arises from the creation and operation of the Delaware subsidiary .\" AeroGlobal Capital \nMgmt. v. Cirrus Indus., 871 A.2d at 439. Since the cause of action is patent infringement, that is \nnot the case here. As to the second, in order to exercise personal jurisdiction over a Delaware \n8 corporation 's parent company , Defendant notes correctly that an agency relationship must exist. \nPlaintiffs should have at least addressed relevant factors, including \"the extent of overlap of \nofficers and directors, methods of financing , the division of responsibility for day-to-day \nmanagement , and the process by which each corporation obtains its business.\" Applied \nBiosystems , Inc. v. Cruachem , Ltd, 772 F. Supp. 1458, 1463 (D. Del. 1991). Plaintiffs do not. \nThe actions Plaintiffs allude t~wnership of intellectual property by the parent, reporting by \nthe CEO of the subsidiary to the CEO of the parent, and commenting by the parent CEO on a \ndata manipulation scandal-seem to be close to the bare minimum of what would be expected \nbetween any parent and subsidiary. \n4. Rule 4(k)(2) \nPlaintiffs argue in the alternative that this court has jurisdiction over Defendant under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2). (D.I. 55 at 13). The Rule states, \n(2) For a claim that arises under federal law, serving a summons or filing a waiver \nof service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant if: \n(A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state's courts of general \njurisdiction ; and \n(B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United States Constitution \nand laws. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2). The parties here do not dispute that the claim arises under federal law, \nnor, for the purposes of this analysis, that Defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state's \ncourts of general jurisdiction. This leaves the issue of whether exercising jurisdiction is \nconsistent with the Constitution. \nThis step looks to whether a defendant 's \"contacts with the United States, but not with \nthe forum state, satisfy due process.\" M-I Drilling Fluids, 890 F.3d at 999 (quoting Synthes \n(US.A.) v. G.M Dos Reis Jr. Ind Com de Equip. Medico, 563 F.3d 1285, 1296 (Fed. Cir. \n2009)). \"Due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in \n9 personam the defendant must have certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the \nmaintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\" \nSynthes, 563 F.3d at 1296 (quoting Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)). The \ndue process analysis for Rule 4(k)(2) considers the five Burger King factors: \"(1) the burden on \nthe defendant; (2) the forum's interest in adjudicating the dispute; (3) the plaintiffs interest in \nobtaining convenient and effective relief; (4) the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining \nthe most efficient resolution of controversies; and (5) the shared interest of the states in \nfurthering fundamental substantive social policies.\" M-I Drilling Fluids, 890 F.3d at 1002 (citing \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. at 477). \nPlaintiffs assert that each of the five Burger King factors weighs in their favor. (Id. at 13-\n14 ). Defendant counters that Plaintiffs misapply the due process analysis by failing to first \nanalyze the existence of contacts between Novartis AG and the United States as a whole. (D.I. 60 \nat 9). \nI agree with Defendant that the analysis must begin with an examination of Defendant's \ncontacts with the United States as a whole. Beyond the contacts with Delaware discussed in \nanalyzing general and specific jurisdiction above, Plaintiffs' briefing points to no additional \nfactual allegations about Novartis AG's contacts with the United States.3 The contacts alleged \nwith Delaware were Defendant's incorporation of subsidiaries, its filing oflawsuits, and its \ncontrol over its Delaware subsidiaries. Just as they were insufficient under the Delaware long\u00ad\narm statute, these contacts are not sufficient under the Constitution. \n3 Plaintiffs allude in passing to Novartis AG being traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and \nNovartis AG owning trademarks and patents. (D.I. 55 at 2-3). It makes no suggestion that these \nfacts should play into the Rule 4(k)(2) analysis, and cites no authority to suggest these constitute \n\"contacts\" for personal jurisdiction purposes. \n10 First, it does not seem that Defendant's contacts are \"so continuous and systematic as to \nrender it essentiall y at home\" in the United States, which would be required for general \njurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2). Daimler, 571 U.S. at 127 (citation omitted). \nSecond, the present lawsuit does not \"arise out of or relate to [Defendant 's] activities \" in \nthe United States. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462,472 (1985) (citation omitted). \nTherefore , since Plaintiffs do not allege the necessary contacts, I do not find jurisdiction under \nRule 4(k)(2). \nC. Jurisdictional Discovery \nPlaintiffs finally argue that they are entitled to jurisdictional discovery because their \nclaim is not \"clearly frivolous \" under Toys \"R\" Us. (D.I. 55 at 15). Plaintiffs also point to \nanother case involving Novartis, Novartis Pharms. Corp. v. Mylan Inc., No. 14-cv-777 , D.I. 49 at \n9, in which I granted jurisdictional discovery. Id. Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have not \n\"established with reasonable particularity the possible existence of the requisite contacts needed \nto obtain.jurisdictional discovery.\" (D.I. 60 at 10). I agree. \nPlaintiffs ' vague assertions about what they hope to find in jurisdictional discovery place \ntheir request in the realm of a \"fishing expedition. \" Eurofins Pharma US Holdings v. BioAlliance \nPharma SA, 623 F.3d 147, 157 (3d Cir. 2010). That I granted jurisdictional discovery to \nNovartis in an unrelated case is completel y irrelevant to whether I should grant such discovery \nagainst Novartis in this case. Plaintiffs have failed to meet the \"reasonable particularity \" standard \nset forth in Toys \"R\" Us, and instead present what seems to me to be a \"clearly frivolous \" \nrequest. 318 F .3d at 456. \n11 IV. CONCLUSI ON \nWithin five days the parties shall submit a proposed order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion. \n12 "}
