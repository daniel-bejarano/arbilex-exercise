{"case_name": "SAMUEL v. NEW CASTLE HOUSING AUTHORITY (NCCHA) et al", "case_number": "20-337", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "03-07-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nEARLANDO SAMUEL, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nROBERT RIZZO, et al., \nDefendants. : Civil Action No. 20-337-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \n1. Introduction. Plaintiff Earlando Samuel proceeds pro se and has been \ngranted leave to proceed in forrna pauperis. This action was commenced on February \n25, 2020 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and \ntransferred to this Court on March 9, 2020. (D.I. 1, 4, 5) Plaintiff invokes the \njurisdiction of this Court by reason of a federal question and diversity of the parties. \n(D.I. 2 at 2) Before the Court are Plaintiffs motions to amend, request for counsel, and \nmotion to withdraw motion to amend. (D.I. 19, 31, 33, 34) \n2. Motions to Amend. On March 26, 2021, Plaintiff filed an amended \ncomplaint construed as a motion for leave to amend. (D.I. 19) On May 27, 2021, \nPlaintiff filed a second motion for leave to amend and, on February 1, 2022, he filed a \nmotion to withdraw the May 27, 2021 motion to amend. (D.I. 31, 34) The Court will \ngrant the motion to withdraw the May 27, 2021 motion to amend. \n3. The March 26, 2021 motion to amend (D.I. 19) will be denied for two \nreasons. First, the pleading does not comply with Local Rule 15.1 which provides that \na party who moves to amend a pleading shall attach to the motion: (1) the proposed \npleading as amended, complete with a handwritten or electronic signature; and (2) a \n1 form of the amended pleading which indicates in what respect it differs from the \npleading which it amends, by bracketing or striking through materials to be deleted and \nunderlining materials to be added. \n4. Second, the proposed amended complaint violates Federal Civil of \nProcedure 20, as it seeks to add new defendants on claims that are unrelated to the \noriginal claims. The new claims arise in a different state (Pennsylvania not Delaware) \nand occurred in a different time-frame, including after the filing of the initial complaint. \nRule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that courts \"should freely \ngive leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\" However, \"undue delay, bad faith, \ndilatory motive, prejudice, [or] futility\" \"justify a denial of leave to amend.\" Shane v. \nFauver, 213 F.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir. 2000). Here, it would be futile to permit amendment \nbecause the proposed claims would not satisfy the joinder requirements of Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 20. See McKinney v. Prosecutor's Office, 2014 WL 2574414, at *15 (D.N.J. June 4, \n2014). \n5. Request for Counsel. Plaintiff requests counsel on the grounds that he \nis unable to afford an attorney, he takes medication to treat confusion related to \nAlzheimer's disease, physical impairments greatly limit his ability to litigate, the issues \nare complex, a trial will likely involve conflicting testimony, counsel would better enable \nPlaintiff present evidence and cross-examine witnesses, and he has unsuccessfully \nsought to retain counsel. (D.I. 33 at 1-2) \n6. A pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or \nstatutory right to representation by counsel.1 See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, \n1 See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989) \n2 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993). However, \nrepresentation by counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a \nfinding that a plaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155. \n7. If the claims pass this threshold inquiry, the court should consider: (1) the \nmerits of the plaintiffs claim; (2) the plaintiffs ability to present his or her case \nconsidering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon \nhim or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to \nwhich factual investigation is required and the plaintiffs ability to pursue such \ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiffs capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and \n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony. \nSee Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at \n155-56. This list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative. Tabron, 6 \nF.3d at 157. \n8. Several of these factors militate against granting Plaintiffs request for \ncounsel at this time. To date Plaintiff has ably represented himself. In addition, the \nissues are not complex. Finally, it is clear from his pleadings that Plaintiff understands \nthe issues he raises and adequately addresses those issues. Accordingly, the Court \nwill deny the request for counsel without prejudice to renew. \n9. Conclusion. Based upon the above discussion, the Court will: (1) deny \nthe March 26, 2021 motion to amend (D.I. 19); (2) deny as withdrawn the May 27, 2021 \nmotion to amend (D.I. 31); (3) deny the without prejudice to renew Plaintiffs second \n\"request.\"). \n3 request for counsel (D.I. 33); and (4) grant the motion to withdraw the May 27, 2021 \nmotion to amend (D.1.34). A separate order shall issue. \nMarch 7, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware \n4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nEARLANDO SAMUEL , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nROBERT RIZZO, et al., \nDefendants. : Civil Action No. 20-337-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 7-(ff'--day of March, 2022 for the reasons set forth in the \nMemorandum issued this date, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.
