C.A. No . 21-1026- RGA- JLH \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \nBefore me is Defendant\u2019s motion for j udgment on the pleadings.  (D.I. 18).  I have \nconsidered the parties\u2019 briefing.  (D.I. 19- 21).  For the reasons set forth below, Defendant\u2019s \nmotion is DENIED.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff Lazer IP sued Defendant Microchip Technology alleging infringement of claims \n12, 24, and 25 (\u201cthe Asserted Claims\u201d) of U.S. Patent No. 6,701,508 (\u201cthe \u2019508 Patent\u201d) on July \n15, 2021.  (D.I. 1).   \nThe \u2019508 Patent  \u201crelates to a system and a method of using a graphics applications \nprogramming interface in programming the design of a microcontrolle r.\u201d  \u2019508 Patent at 1:22- 25.  \nRecognizing the problem that  \u201cthe user interface portions of many conventional software \napplications for programming microcontrollers  are very difficult to use [,]\u201d the \u2019508 Patent \ndescribes an inventive \u201cmicrocontroller progra mming application \u201d that \u201cprovides an organized \nway of displaying a device editor workspace information in an efficient manner.\u201d  Id. at 2:25- 58; \n(see also D.I. 1 at \u00b610 (\u201cThe invention of the \u2019508 Patent included the steps of compartmentalizing 2 the design of a microcontroller by modularizing the various components that create the desired \nfunctionality of the microcontroller using a graphic user  interface.\u201d)).    \nClaim 12 is  representative of the Asserted Claims  for purposes of this motion.  ( See D.I. \n21 at 2 n.1 (\u201cLazer IP concedes that claim 12 is representative[.]\u201d)).  Claim 12 requires:  \nA device editor system for programming a target microcontroller device, comprising:  \na user module selection workspace for providing a plurality of selectable pre -\nconfigured user modules for programming said target  microcontroller device;  \na user module placement workspace for placing selected user modules of said \nplurality of user modules ; and  \na user module pin out workspace for providing pin out parameterization for said \nselected user modules.  \nDuring prosecution of the \u2019508 Patent, the patent applicant explained that the claimed user \nmodule workspaces each \u201cperform[] a particular independent function, facilitating a particula r step \nof a programmable microcontroller design process.\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \u00b611  (quoting the prosecution \nhistory) ).  T he patent applicant distinguished the Asserted Claims from the prior art by arguing \nthat, while the prior art \u201cteaches a system for designing and simulating a circuit using a single \ndisplay window[,]\u201d the prior art \u201cdoes not teach, describe, or suggest a device editor sub -system \ncomprising a user module selection[] workspace, a user module placement workspace, and a user \nmodule pin out workspace a s claimed.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b612 (quoting the prosecution history)).  According \nto Plaintiff, the claimed \u201cuser modules\u201d \u201cbenefited computer operation \u2026 [and] functionality.\u201d  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b611 -12, 11).  For example, \u201c[t]he user module placement workspace allows a user to place \nthe selected user modules according to the hardware resources of the electronic device.\u201d   (Id. at \n\u00b611 (quoting the prosecution history)).  Thus, \u201can aspect of the current invention provides a \nprogramming application that provides an organized device editor workspace for efficient \nprogramming of a microcontroller.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b612 (quoting the prosecution history) ). 3 II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is reviewed under the same standard \nas a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to di smiss when the Rule 12(c) motion alleges that the plaintiff failed to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.  See Turbe v. Gov\u2019t of the Virgin Islands , 938 F.2d \n427, 428 (3d Cir. 1991); Revell v. Port Auth. , 598 F.3d 128, 134 (3d Cir. 2010).  The court must \naccept the factual allegations in the complaint and take them in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party.  See Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007); Christopher v. Harbury , 536 U.S. \n403, 406 (2002).  \u201cWhen there are well -ple[d] fa ctual allegations, a court should assume their \nveracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d  Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  The court must \u201cdraw on its judicial experience and common \nsense\u201d to make this  determination.  See id .   \nSection 101 of the Patent Act defines patent -eligible subject matter.  It provides: \n\u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  The Supreme Court has recognized an implicit exception for three categories of subject matter not eligible for patentability: laws of \nnature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.  See Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , 134 S. Ct. \n2347, 2354 (2014).   \nThe Supreme Court laid out  the framework for distinguishing \u201cpatents that claim laws of \nnature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim patent- eligible applications of \nthose concepts.\u201d  Id. at 2355.  First, the court must determine whether the claims are directed  to \na patent -ineligible concept.  See id.  If the answer is yes, the court must \u201cconsider the elements \nof each claim both individually and as an ordered combination to determine whether  [there is an] 4 inventive concept \u2014 i.e., an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the \npatent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\u201d  \nId. (cleaned up).  \n\u201cWhether a claim is drawn to patent -eligible subject matter under \u00a7 101 is an issue of \nlaw[.]\u201d  In re Bilski , 545 F.3d 943, 951 (Fed. Cir. 2008), aff \u2019d sub nom. Bilski v. Kappos , 561 U.S. \n593 (2010) .  The district court is not required to individually address claims not asserted or \nidentified by the non -moving party, so long as the court identifies a representative claim and \u201call \nthe claims are substantially similar and linked to the same abstract id ea.\u201d  Content Extraction & \nTransmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat. Ass\u2019n , 776 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ( cleaned \nup). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n\u201cThe first step in the  Alice  inquiry \u2026 asks whether the  focus of the claims is on [a] specific \nasserted improvement in computer capabilities \u2026 or, instead, on a process that qualifies as an \n\u2018abstract idea\u2019  for which computers are invoked merely as a tool.\u201d  Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft  \nCorp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1335- 36 (Fed. Cir. 2016) .  This analysis \u201cdepends on an accurate \ncharacterization of what the claims require and of what the patent asserts to be the claimed advance.\u201d  TecSec, Inc. v. Adobe Inc., 978 F.3d 1278, 1294 ( Fed. Cir. 2020). \nDefendant argues that the Asserted Claims \u201c are directed to the abstract idea of organizing \nand displaying information related to programming a microcontroller.\u201d  (D.I. 19 at 7).  To \nsupport this, Defendant argues  that \u201cthe claimed workspaces at best make it easier for a circuit \ndesigner  to organize  and process the programming informat ion more quickly[,]\u201d where, \u201c in the \ncontext of a graphical user interface  [GUI] , claims that merely simplify a task for the user without \nimproving the functioning of the computer are ineligible abstract ideas.\u201d  ( Id. at 7-10, 8 (citing 5 Trading Techs.  Int\u2019l, Inc. v. IBG LLC, 921 F.3d 1378, 1384- 85 (Fed. Cir. 2019)  (holding claims  \ndirected to a GUI that \u201cprovid[es]  information to traders in a way that helps them process \ninformation more quickly\u201d  were directed to an abstract idea because this interface  \u201cdoes not \nimprove the functioning of the computer, make it operate more efficiently, or solve any \ntechnological problem\u201d )).   \nDefendant further argues  that, because \u201cthe asserted claims are directed to a GUI that \norganizes and allegedly simplifies tasks that microcontroller designers previously performed in their heads, on paper, or by using \u2018conventional\u2019 software[,]\u201d  this provides an additional basis for \nfinding the Asserted Claims are directed to an abstract idea.  ( D.I. 19 at 8, 11- 12 (citing Intell.  \nVentures  I LLC v. Symantec Corp., 838 F.3d 1307, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (in finding claims were \ndirected to an abstract idea, considering that , \u201cwith the exception of generic computer -\nimplemented steps, there is nothing in the claims themselves that foreclose them from being \nperformed by a human, mentally or with pen and paper \u201d); X One,  Inc. v. Uber  Techs.,  Inc., 239 F. \nSupp. 3d 1174, 1191 (N.D. Cal. 2017)  (explaining that \u201c an improvement in efficiency created by \nmoving to a new technological environment does not render a patent non- abstract \u201d)). \nPlaintiff  responds  by arguing that the Asserted Claims are not directed to an abstract idea \nbecause,  \u201c[a]s pled in the Complaint and as reflected in the prosecution history,\u201d the claimed \nsystem  for programming a microcontroller  \u201cimprove[s] the functionality of a computer\u201d  using a \n\u201cspecific technique that departs from earlier approaches.\u201d   (D.I. 20 at 11- 13 (citing SRI  Int\u2019l,  Inc. \nv. Cisco  Sys., Inc., 930 F.3d 1295, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\u201c The claims are directed to using a \nspecific technique \u2026 to solve a technological problem arising in computer networks[ .]\u201d), cert. \nden., 140 S.Ct. 1108 (2020)) .  Unlike the Asserted Claims, the prior art \u201cdoes not teach, describe 6 or suggest an electronic device configuration system utilizing user modules .\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 \u00b611-12, \n12).   \nPlaintiff  also asserts , \u201c[Defendant] cannot demonstrate that the present claims can be \nperformed by a human.\u201d  (D.I. 20 at 13 -14, 13) .  Specifically, Plaintiff rebuts  Defendant\u2019s \nassertions that the claimed invention could be performed by hand as \u201clack[ing] any analysis or \nsupport \u2026 more than counsel\u2019s say- so[,]\u201d noting that such assertion s \u201ccannot be considered \nbecause they directly contradict the facts and inferences \u2026 that were pled in the Complaint.\u201d  (D.I. \n20 at 6- 7 (citing D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b611- 12 (describing  the inventive ness of the Asserted Claims) )). \nDefendant has not shown that  the Asserted Claims are directed to an  abstract idea.  The \nAsserted Claims are instead directed to an improved user interface for computer  devices allowing \nfor more efficient programming of microcontroller s.  See Core  Wireless  Licensing  S.A.R.L. v. LG \nElecs.,  Inc., 880 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2018)  (\u201cThe asserted claims in this case are d irected \nto an improved user interface for computing devices, not to the abstract idea of an index[.]\u201d) ; (see \nalso D.I. 20 at 13- 16).  Like the Federal Circuit, I conclude,  \u201cAlthough the generic idea of \n[designing microcontroller s] certainly existed prior to the invention, these claims are directed to a \nparticular manner [for designing a microcontroller]  in electronic devices.\u201d  Core  Wireless , 880 \nF.3d at 1362- 63.  The \u2019508 Patent\u2019s specification and prosecution history confirm tha t the \nAsserted Claims  are directed to a user interface for designing microcontrollers  that improves upon \ninefficiencies in prior software .  See \u2019508 Patent at 2: 1-58; (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b611 -12); see also  Core  \nWireless , 880 F.3d at 1363 (considering a specification\u2019s description of a more efficient user \ninterface and finding that \u201cthis language clearly indicates that the claims are directed to an \nimprovement in t he functioning of computers\u201d).  \u201cIn other words, we are not faced wit h a situation \nwhere general -purpose computer components are added post -hoc to a fundamental economic 7 practice or mathematical equation.  Rather, the claims are directed to a specific implementation \nof a solution to a problem in the software arts.\u201d   Enfish , 822 F.3d at  1339. \nRegarding Defendant\u2019s argument that the claimed invention could be performed on paper  \nor in someone\u2019s head, I disagree  on the current record.  I ndeed, the specification directly refutes \nDefendant\u2019s unsupported contention.  See \u2019508 Patent at 1:34- 35 (\u201cThe application software is \ngenerally developed using a personal computer.\u201d).  Moreover, it is unclear how a hand- drawn or \nimaginary circuit diagram could be used \u201c for program ming  a target microcontroller device\u201d (as is \nrequired by claim 12) when such programming may require  \u201cload[ing] [data] into the \nmicrocontroller\u2019s programmable memory to in turn program hardware resources of the \nmicrocontroller.\u201d  \u2019508 Patent  at 1:34-38.  Th us, the Asserted Claims ar e directed to improved \nsoftware  for programming a microcontroller  that provide s \u201ca solution to a problem specifically \narising in the realm of \u2026 computers.\u201d  TecSec, 978 F.3d at 1293; see also  Data Engine  Techs.  \nLLC v. Google  LLC, 906 F.3d 999, 1008- 09 (Fed. Cir. 2018)  (considering that \u201c the claims require \na specific interface and implementation for navigating complex three -dimensional spreadsheets \nusing techniques unique to computers \u201d in finding claims were not directed to an abstract idea ). \nFurther, I disagree that the Asserted Claims are akin to those found ineligible in Trading \nTechnologies .  In Trading Technologies , the Federal Circuit considered a claim directed to a GUI \nthat \u201cfocuses on improving the trader, not the functioning of the computer [,]\u201d by \u201cproviding a \ntrader with new or different information in an existing trading screen.\u201d  Trading Techs., 921 F.3d \nat 1383.  This claim was found to use a generic computer as a \u201ctool for presentation\u201d of trading \ninformation  and, thus, \u201cd[id] not improve the functioning of the computer, make it operate mor e \nefficiently, or solve any technological problem.\u201d  Id. at 1385 (cleaned up).  In contrast, the \nAsserted Claims are not directed to a  GUI that merely presents  information to a use r.  Instead, t he 8 Asserted Claims  are directed to improved software for programming a microcontroller .  While \nthis improved software relies  on displaying information to a user  as part of its operation, this is the  \ncase with any computer interface.   \nI think the Asserted Claims are closely  analogous  to those found eligible in Core Wireless , \nwhere the claims  were directed to \u201c an improved user interface for electronic devices, particularly \nthose with small screens[,]\u201d which \u201cimproves the efficiency of using the electronic device [.]\u201d  \nCore  Wireles s, 880 F.3d at 1363 (noting that the specification confirms that the considered clai ms \nimproved upon efficiencies in prior art interfaces) .  Similarly, the Asserted Claims are directed  to \na software  that allows for more \u201cefficient programming of a microcontroller.\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \u00b612 \n(quoting the prosecution history) ).  For these reasons, I find that the Asserted Claims are not \ndirected to an abstract idea.  \n\u201cBecause [I] conclude that the [Asserted Claims]  \u2026 are not directed to an abstract idea, [I] \nneed not proceed to step two of the  Alice  test. \u201d  Visual  Memory LLC v. NVIDIA  Corp., 867 F.3d \n1253, 1262 (Fed. Cir. 2017) . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nDefendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings  is DENIED.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED this  2nd day of June  2022. \n \n/s/ Richard G . Andrews  \nUnited States District Judge  "}
