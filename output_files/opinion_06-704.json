Action No. 06-74-GBW\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nRespondent/Plaintiff.\nMEMORANDUM\nOn May 16, 2007, Movant Jonathan Johnson pled guilty in this Court to\nbeing a prohibited person in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n922(g)(1) and \u00a7 924(a)(2). (D.I. 3; D.I. 32; D.I. 46-1 at 2) At the conclusion of the\nsentencing hearing on October 31,2007, the Honorable Joseph J. Faman sentenced\nMovant to sixty months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised\nrelease. The judgment was entered on December 4, 2007. (D.I. 38) Movant\nappealed, and the Third Circuit affirmed Movant's judgment of conviction and\nsentence on December 31,2008. (See D.I. 46-1)\nOn December 11,2013, the United States Probation Office submitted a\npetition to this Court seeking revocation of Movant's supervised release because\nMovant had tested positive for marijuana. (D.I. 51) At a hearing on January 9,2014, the Honorable Leonard P. Stark found Movant in violation of the terms of\nhis supervised release. (D.I. 61) As a result, on January 10, 2014, an Amended\nJudgment was entered sentencing Movant to five months of imprisonment, to be\nfollowed by twelve additional months of supervised release. (D.I. 55) Movant\nappealed, and the Third Circuit affirmed Movant's sentence on September 17,\n2014. (See D.I. 62)\nOn March 4,2015, the United States Probation Office submitted a petition to\nthis Court seeking revocation of Movant's supervised release because Movant had\ntested positive for marijuana and had also been arrested in Philadelphia for driving\nunder the influence of marijuana. (D.I. 63) A hearing for revocation of supervised\nrelease was held before Judge Stark on April 8, 2015. On April 13,2015, an\nAmended Judgment was entered sentencing Movant to two months of\nimprisonment, with no further term of supervised release to follow. (D.I. 72)\nMovant did not appeal that sentence.\nSeven years later, on August 17, 2022, Movant filed in this Court a\ndocument titled \"Motion To File Out-Of-Time; Permission to File an Untimely\nAppeal of Suppress[ion] Denial.\" (D.I. 73) In the Motion, Movant asserts that: (1)\nhis guilty plea was involuntary and unknowing; and (2) defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to advise him of his right to appeal the denial of\nhis suppression motion. (D.I. 73 at 2-4) For relief, he asks the Court to vacate hissentence, set aside his plea, and afford him the opportunity to file an out-of-time\nappeal from the denial of his suppression motion.^ (D.L 73 at 2-4) On September\n13,2022, Movant filed a second document, titled \"Supplemental Demand Relief to\nMotion to File Out-of-Time Pursuant [to] Rule 4.5(b),\" wherein Movant asserts he\nwants to \"vacate sentence,\" \"withdraw plea and/or set aside,\" and be granted\npermission to file an out-of-time appeal with respect to the denial of his\nsuppression motion. (D.I. 74 at 1) Finally, on September 14, 2022 Movant filed\ncopies of two summons requesting responses to those filings; one summons is\naddressed to the United States Attorney, and the other summons is addressed to his\nformer defense counsel. (D.I. 75)\nGiven the language in the Movant's aforementioned filings, the Court\nconstrued the documents to be a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and, after completing its preliminary screening,\ndetermined that the \u00a7 2255 motion is imtimely. The Court provided Movant with\nan opportunity to indicate whether he agreed that he was seeking relief under \u00a7\n2255 and, if so, to show cause why the motion should not be dismissed as time-\n^On November 22, 2006, Movant filed a motion to suppress \"all evidence taken\nfrom the person of [Movant], and/or his premises, by police or Government agents,\nand all oral or written statements made by [Movant].\" (D.I. 20) On March 29,\n2007, Judge Faman granted the motion to the extent Movant requested the\n\"suppression of his statements to the police,\" and denied the motion to the extent\nMovant \"challenge[d] the evidence obtained from the investigative stop and search\nincident to his arrest.\" (D.I. 28)barred. On October 4, 2022, Movant responded that he was not seeking relief\nunder \u00a7 2255 but, instead, he was seeking permission under Federal Rule of\nAppellate 4(b)(4) to file an out-of-time appeal due to \"excusable neglect\" or \"good\ncause.\"^ (D.I. 78 at 1)\nGiven Movant's explicit statement in his Reply, the Court will treat the\n1\nMotion filed on August 17, 2022 (D.I. 73) and the Supplemental Demand for\nRelief filed on September 13,2022 (D.I. 74) as a Motion for an Extension of Time\nto File an Out-of-Time Appeal (\"Motion for an Extension of Time\"). Movant\nasserts his failure to timely file an appeal firom the denial of his suppression motion\n^Movant's subsequent filings in this Court reveal that he is no longer in custody\npursuant to his 2007 felon-in-possession conviction. Rather, he is currently in\nstate custody pursuant to his 2017 conviction in the Delaware Superior Court for\ndrug dealing and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony\n(\"PFDCF\"). (See D.I. 70 at 2-3); see also Johnson v. State, 2020 WL 4730405, at\n*1 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 14,2020). Since Movant's sentence for his federal 2007\nfelon-in-possession conviction had completely expired by the time he filed the\ninstant Motion for an Extension of Time, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider\nthe instant challenge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. See, e.g., Pileggi v. United States,\n2022 WL 2375166, at *2 (M.D. Pa. June 30,2022). Consequently, to the extent\nthe Court preliminarily characterized Movant's August 2022 Motion (D.I. 73) as\nan untimely \u00a7 2255 motion and provided Movant with an opportunity to show\ncause why the filing should not be summarily dismissed as time-barred (See D.I.\n76; D.I. 77), the Court notes that it should also have included Movant's failure to\nsatisfy the \"in custody\" requirement of \u00a7 2255(a) as an additional basis for\nsummary dismissal. Nevertheless, given Movant's explicit contention that he is\nnot seeking \u00a7 2255 relief with respect to the August 2022 Motion (D.I. 78 at 1), the\nCourt need not provide Movant with an opportunity to address the jurisdictional\ndefect.was due to defense counsel's failure to advise him of his appeal rights. (D.I. 73 at\n2-3; D.I. 78)\nTo the extent Movant is requesting an extension of time to file an out-of-\ntime appeal from his original judgment of conviction and sentence entered in 2007,\nthe request is denied. Movant already appealed his 2007 conviction, and the Third\nCircuit affirmed his conviction and sentence on December 31, 2008. (D.I. 46)\nTo the extent Movant is requesting an extension of time to file an out-of-\ntime appeal from the most recent Amended Judgment that was entered on April 13,\n2015 (D.I. 72), the request is also denied. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 4(b)(4), the Court may grant Movant's Motion for an Extension of Time\nonly if it was filed no later than thirty days after the expiration of the fourteen-day\ntime period originally prescribed by Rule 4(b)(1)(A), and Movant shows either\nexcusable neglect or good cause. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(4). In this case, the\nfourteen-day time period to appeal the Court's April 13, 2015 entry of Amended\nJudgment (D.I. 72) expired on Monday April 27,2015, and the additional thirty-\nday window of time permitted under Rule 4(b)(4) expired on May 27, 2015. Since\nMovant filed the instant request for an extension of time more than seven yearsafter the May 27, 2015 deadline, the Court will deny the Motion for an Extension\nofTime.^ An appropriate Order follows.\nDated: Noveniber\\V , 2022\nUnited States District Court Judge\n^Even if Movant had timely filed the instant request, the Motion for an Extension\nof Time would be denied because Movant has failed to demonstrate excusable\nneglect or good cause for his seven-year delay.IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nJONATHAN JOHNSON,\nMovant/Defendant,\nV.\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nRespondent/Plaintiff.Crim.
