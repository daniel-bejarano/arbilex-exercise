Jones (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g)\non August 18, 2020 against the defendant Kilolo Kijakazi, the Acting Commissioner of the\nSocial Security Administration (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d). (D.I. 2) Plaintiff seeks judicial review of\nthe Commissioner\u2019s May 20, 2019 final decision denying Plaintiff's claim for disability\ninsurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title II of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n401-433. Currently before the court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff\nand the Commissioner.\u2019 (D.I. 22; D.I. 28) For the reasons set forth below, I recommend that the\ncourt DENY Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (D.I. 22), and GRANT the\n\nCommissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment (D.I. 28).\n\n' Kilolo Kijakazi became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021.\nTherefore, pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Ms. Kijakazi is\nsubstituted as Defendant in place of Andrew Saul.\n\n2 On December 9, 2021, the parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge to conduct\nall proceedings in this matter through final judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). (D.I. 24)\n3 The briefing on the pending motions is found at D.I. 23, D.I. 30, and D.I. 31.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nPlaintiff protectively filed an application for DIB on April 5, 2017, alleging a disability\nonset date of January 18, 2017 due to panic attacks, agoraphobia, restlessness, generalized\nanxiety disorder, and extreme anxiety. (D.I. 11 at 183-85, 210) Plaintiff's claims were denied\ninitially in June 2017 and upon reconsideration in December 2017. (Jd. at 78, 93) At Plaintiffs\nrequest, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on May 2, 2019. (/d. at 48-77) The\nALJ issued an unfavorable decision on May 20, 2019, finding that Plaintiff was capable of a full\nrange of work at all exertional levels, with some nonexertional limitations. (D.I. 11 at 14-24)\nThe Appeals Council subsequently denied Plaintiff's request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision,\nmaking the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. (Id. at 5-7)\n\nPlaintiff brought this civil action challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision on August 18, 2020.\n(DI. 2) Plaintiff filed the pending motion for summary judgment on December 9, 2021 (D.I.\n22), and the Commissioner cross-moved for summary judgment on March 11, 2022 (D.I. 28).\nBriefing is now complete on the pending motions.\n\nB. Medical History\n\nPlaintiff was 44 years old on her alleged disability onset date of January 18, 2017. (D.I.\n11 at 23) The ALJ found that Plaintiff had the following severe impairments: panic attacks,\nagoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. (/d. at 17) The court\nfocuses its summary of the medical evidence on the records relevant to the challenges raised by\nPlaintiff. Plaintiff's appeal is largely focused on whether the ALJ\u2019s determination of Plaintiff's\n\nresidual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) accounts for functional limitations related to Plaintiff's\nagoraphobia.4\n1. Medical evidence\n\nBeginning in February 2015, Plaintiff saw Nadeem Afzal, M.D. for psychiatric treatment.\n(DI. 11 at 460) At the time, Dr. Afzal indicated that Plaintiff wanted to stop taking her\npsychiatric medications and switch completely to herbal supplements, and she reported that her\nsymptoms were under control with the combination of Zoloft and herbal supplements. (/d.) Dr.\nAfzal observed signs of anxiety and moderate depression, but her behavior was otherwise\nnormal. (Jd. at 461) Subsequent treatment notes through the end of 2015 disclosed stable\nfindings, partial treatment response to medication, and no medication side effects. (Id. at 463-\n72) By 2016, she was showing no signs of depression or anxiety, and she began tapering her\nZoloft dosage in November 2016. (Jd. at 473-87) However, she experienced anxiety and\nwithdrawal symptoms in early 2017 as a result of the tapering, and Dr. Afzal restarted her Zoloft\nprescription. (/d. at 488)\n\nPlaintiff visited the emergency room on January 18, 2017 due to an acute panic attack,\nand she was discharged with a prescription for Xanax and instructions to follow up with Dr.\nAfzal. (D.I. 11 at 283, 288-89) The following day, Dr. Afzal observed that Plaintiff\u2019s anxiety\nsymptoms were worse. (/d. at 491) He increased her Zoloft dosage and instructed her to start\ntaking Xanax as well. (Jd. at 492) Plaintiff's symptoms continued to get worse that month, and\n\nshe expressed concern that she would lose her job. (/d. at 495)\n\n\u2018 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Mental Health\ndefines \u201cagoraphobia\u201d as \u201can anxiety disorder that involves intense fear and anxiety of any place\nor situation where escape might be difficult. Agoraphobia involves avoidance of situations such\nas being alone outside of the home; traveling in a car, bus, or airplane; or being in a crowded\n\narea.\u201d See https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/agoraphobia (last visited on April 4,\n2022).\nIn early February, Plaintiff indicated that her panic attacks and anxiety had improved,\nalthough she still appeared very anxious. (D.I. 11 at 498) Dr. Afzal increased her Zoloft dosage.\n(id.) On February 13, 2017, she was voluntarily admitted to the Rockford Center for five days\ndue to worsening anxiety and panic attacks. (Id. at 364-69) There, her Zoloft and Xanax\nprescriptions were discontinued, and she was switched to Prozac, Klonopin, gabapentin, and\nSeroquel. (/d. at 367) Upon her discharge, she was not anxious and was clinically stable, with a\ndischarge prognosis of \u201cfair.\u201d (Jd, at 368-70) Subsequent treatment notes from Dr. Afzal\nindicate that Plaintiff showed a partial treatment response and her anxiety improved overall, but\nshe still showed signs of anxiety and her Prozac dosage was increased. (/d. at 501, 504, 507,\n510)\n\nPlaintiff also saw psychotherapist John Stephen Parker, M.S., L.P.C. from February to\nMay of 2017. (D.I. 11 at 373-96) Mr. Parker\u2019s notes describe Plaintiff's self-reports about her\nanxiety and panic attacks, with a consistent focus on her interpersonal difficulties. (/d.) Plaintiff\nsuggested that she should only drive or perform activities of daily living at times when she has\nno anxiety. (/d. at 381)\n\nPlaintiff reported having panic attacks and worsening anxiety in May 2017 as a result of\nrelationship difficulties, which interfered with her ability to walk, write, and do laundry. (D.I. 11\nat 514, 517,520) Dr. Afzal indicated that Plaintiff was experiencing anxiety and moderate\ndepression, and he increased her Prozac dosage again. (/d.) Plaintiff also visited her primary\ncare provider, nurse practitioner Roberta Beiso, for her anxiety and depression between May and\nJuly 2017. (id. at 599-604, 606-07) During a visit in June, Plaintiffs care provider reported that\nshe was tearful and upset throughout the appointment, although she was not experiencing a crisis\n\nsituation at the time. (/d. at 604)\nPlaintiff's mood had improved by mid-July. (D.I. 11 at 599-601) Days later, however,\nDr. Afzal reported that Plaintiff had experienced a setback resulting in tearfulness, increased\npanic attacks, and reduced ability to function independently. (/d. at 522) Dr. Afzal increased\nPlaintiff's dosage of Prozac and, although Plaintiff reported that the increase resulted in a skin\nrash, Dr. Afzal continued her on the higher dosage. (/d. at 522-23, 525-26)\n\nIn September 2017, Plaintiff reported taking additional Klonopin to control her anxiety,\nwhich then led to side effects including memory loss. (D.I. 11 at 529) After Dr. Afzal began to\ntaper Plaintiff's Klonopin dosage, Plaintiff reported that she was still anxious but she did not\nhave as many panic attacks. (Id. at 529-34, 566, 568, 570) Plaintiff asked to further taper her\nKlonopin during her visit with Dr. Afzel on January 16, 2018, and her treatment notes confirmed\nthat she was less anxious at that time. (Jd. at 564) By April 2018, Plaintiff reported that she\ncould only function for two hours each day due to her anxiety, but she wanted to stop taking her\nmedication because of side effects including fatigue, memory issues, constipation, and tingling\nsensations. (/d. at 554-60)\n\nDr. Afzal further reduced her Klonopin dosage in July 2018, despite persistent signs of\nanxiety and mild depression, because she planned to start working ten hours per week. (D.I. 11\nat 550) Contemporaneous treatment notes from Ms. Beiso indicated that Plaintiff \u201cfeels well\nwith no complaints\u201d and \u201csleeps 8 hours per night.\u201d (/d. at 594) Plaintiff exhibited no signs of\nanxiety and depression at the time, and Ms. Beiso completed a health appraisal form on\nPlaintiffs behalf as she sought employment in a childcare facility. (Id. at 593-94)\n\nDuring a visit with Dr. Afzel in September 2018, Plaintiff indicated that she had adjusted\nto working for fourteen hours per week. (D.I. 11 at 546) However, she reported experiencing\n\nsevere withdrawal symptoms every time her medication dosages were reduced, and Dr. Afzel\nindicated that she was tearful and showed signs of severe depression. (/d.) Nonetheless,\nPlaintiff sought to gradually continue reducing her Klonopin dosage in October 2018. (/d. at\n544)\n\nIncluded in the administrative record are treatment notes from 2019, which were not\npresented to the ALJ before the issuance of his written decision.> On April 25, 2019, Plaintiff\nvisited the emergency room for treatment of a severe headache that had persisted for two months.\n(D.I. 22-1 at 4) Plaintiff associated the headache with the tapering of her Klonopin and Prozac\nmedications. (/d.) A CT scan and an MRI of Plaintiff's head revealed a pituitary adenoma and\nwhite matter lesions which raised concerns of radiographic multiple sclerosis or other\ndemyelinating disease. (/d. at 13-14, 16-17) Plaintiffs pituitary lab reports came back normal,\nand she was discharged from the hospital on April 27, 2019. (D.I. 22-1 at J 3; D.I. 22-1 at 18-\n20)\n\n2. Medical opinions\n\nDr. Afzal completed a medical certification form for Plaintiff in January 2017 and again\nin November 2017. (D.I. 11 at 652-53) On both occasions, Dr. Afzal indicated that Plaintiff was\nunable to work on a full-time basis, and he estimated that her panic disorder would last for six to\ntwelve months. (/d.)\n\nOn May 30, 2017, Mr. Parker completed a Disability Determination Services\n\nquestionnaire for Plaintiff in which he described her as anxious, depressed, angry, resentful,\n\n5 The court\u2019s summary of Plaintiff's 2019 medical records is relevant to the analysis at \u00a7 III.B.5,\ninfra. The court\u2019s consideration of this evidence for the limited purpose of addressing Plaintiff's\narguments under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(g) is permissible. See Arce o/b/o L.A. v. Saul, 2020 WL\n2793132, at *7 (E.D. Pa. May 29, 2020) (\u201c{I]f a plaintiff offers evidence in this court that was\nnot presented to the ALJ, the court must address the issue of whether a new evidence remand is\nwarranted under the sixth sentence of \u00a7 405(g)[,]\u201d which requires a showing of materiality and\ngood cause).\nagitated, and distraught. (D.I. 11 at 398-402) He indicated that she experienced panic attacks,\ninsomnia, and weight gain, but he confirmed that her activities of daily living were normal. (Jd.\nat 399-400) As to Plaintiff's diagnoses of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety\ndisorder, Mr. Parker opined that her prognosis was good with continued therapy. (/d. at 401)\n\nOn June 15, 2017, Plaintiffs primary care practitioner completed a disability form\nindicating that Plaintiff could return to work on August 1, 2017. (D.I. 11 at 605, 611) Two\nweeks later, state agency psychologist Jane Curran opined that Plaintiffs description of her\nlimitations was inconsistent with her treatment records and her treating practitioners\u2019\nassessments of her capacity to maintain activities of daily living. (Id. at 85-88) The review of\nPlaintiff's records revealed no evidence of problems maintaining appropriate behavior and\nhygiene, going out independently, or interacting with others. (/d. at 89) Consistent with the\nrecords from Dr. Afzal and Mr. Parker, the state agency psychologist opined that Plaintiff could\nperform simple, routine work in a low contact setting. (Id.) A second state agency psychologist,\nDr. Christopher King, evaluated Plaintiff's records in November 2017 and confirmed the\nfindings of the first state agency psychologist. (D.I. 11 at 101-05)\n\nDr. Afzel issued the most recent opinion in the record in a letter dated August 8, 2018.\n(D.I. 11 at 540) The letter confirms that Plaintiff was compliant with her treatment regimen and\ncould resume part-time work of up to 10 hours per week, with the potential to increase her hours\nas tolerated. (/d.)\n\n3. Third party statements\n\nPlaintiffs friend, Timothy Jefferson, completed a witness statement in April 2018\n\ndescribing how Plaintiff requires a lot of sleep throughout the day and can only function for\n\nabout two hours at a time. (D.I. 11 at 261) Mr. Jefferson also explained that Plaintiff's mood\nswings, irritability, and depression interfere with her activities of daily living. (/d.) Plaintiff's\nsister, Nancy Watson, completed a witness statement the following week indicating that Plaintiff\nwas unable to work without assistance or drive a car, and tremors in her hands affected her\nability to grip objects. (/d. at 262) Ms. Watson explained that Plaintiff had experienced these\nlimitations \u201c[o]ver the past 30 years.\u201d (/d.)\n\nC. Hearing Before the ALJ\n\nJ. Plaintiff? Testimony\n\nDuring the May 2, 2019 hearing before the ALJ, Plaintiff testified that she lives with her\nthree teenage children, she has a master\u2019s degree in education, and she has a driver\u2019s license,\nalthough she does not often drive. (D.I. 11 at 53-55) She testified that she last worked part-time\nas a fourth-grade paraprofessional for two months, ending in April 2019. (id. at 56) She\npreviously worked part-time in 2018, managing paperwork and substituting for teacher absences\nin her role as the assistant director of a childcare center. (Jd. at 57)\n\nIn 2017, before her disability onset date, Plaintiff worked at the Salvation Army as a case\nmanager, preparing case plans for individuals with mental health impairments and assisting them\nin applying for services. (D.I. 11 at 59-60) She previously worked as a first-grade teacher for\nabout six months in 2015, but her responsibilities did not require her to develop lesson plans or\nassess student performance. (/d. at 61-62) Plaintiff also testified that she had experience\nworking at a childcare center caring for preschool children, although she did not specify when or\nhow long she worked in this role. (Jd. at 62-63)\n\nPlaintiff described how she experiences sluggishness on a daily basis and has trouble\nwith ordinary activities such as bathing and preparing food. (D.I. 11 at 58) During the day, she\n\nreads and sleeps. (Jd. at 64) She relies on her children to buy food and perform household\nchores. (Id. at 64-65) She attends church on a weekly basis and she goes to her medical\nappointments. (/d. at 65, 67) Plaintiff testified that her medications have side effects that impact\nher memory and cause drowsiness. (/d. at 68)\n2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ\n\nAt the administrative hearing in May 2019, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical to\nvocational expert (\u201cthe VE\u201d):\n\nNow if I ask you to assume a hypothetical individual of the Claimant\u2019s age,\n\neducation, and the past jobs that you identified. This individual could perform\n\nwork at all exertional levels but would be unable to climb ropes, ladders, or\n\nscaffolds or be exposed to hazards like unprotected heights or dangerous moving\n\nmachinery. Individual could perform simple, routine, and repetitive work but not\n\nat a production pace. This person could occasionally interact with the general\n\npublic, coworkers, and supervisors and can make simple work-related decisions\n\nwith up to occasional change in work setting but could not travel to unfamiliar\n\nplaces as part of the work responsibilities. Could this individual perform any of\n\nthe Claimant\u2019s past relevant work?\n(D.I. 11 at 73) In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the VE testified that such a hypothetical\nindividual would not be able to perform Plaintiff\u2019 past work as a case manager, elementary\nschool teacher, or childcare teacher. (Jd. at 73-74) However, the VE indicated that such a\nhypothetical individual could work as a marker, a router, or an office helper. (/d. at 74)\n\nIn response to questioning by Plaintiff\u2019 counsel, the VE testified that the hypothetical\nindividual would be precluded from all work if: (1) she had less than an occasional ability to\nrespond appropriately to usual work situations and to changes in a routine work setting; (2) she\n\nwere off task 20 percent or more of the work day due to medication side effects; or (3) she were\n\nabsent three or more days per month on a consistent basis. (D.I. 11 at 75)\nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings\n\nBased on the medical evidence in the record and the testimony by Plaintiff and the VE,\nthe ALJ determined that Plaintiff was not disabled under the Act for the relevant time period\nfrom the January 18, 2017 disability onset date through the hearing date. (D.I. 11 at 14-24) The\nALJ found, in pertinent part:\n\n1. The claimant meets the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act\nthrough June 30, 2023.\n\n2. The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since January 18,\n2017, the alleged onset date (20 CFR 404.1571 et seq.).\n\n3. The claimant has the following severe impairments: panic attacks,\nagoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder (20 CFR\n404.1520(c)).\n\n4. The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that\nmeets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(d), 404.1525 and\n404.1526).\n\n5. After careful consideration of the entire record, I find that the claimant has the\nresidual functional capacity to perform a full range of work at all exertional\nlevels but with the following nonexertional limitations: The claimant cannot\nclimb ropes, ladders or scaffolds, and cannot be exposed to hazards like\nunprotected heights or dangerous moving machinery. The claimant can\nperform simple, routine, and repetitive work, but not at a production pace.\n\nThe claimant can occasionally interact with the general public, coworkers, and\nsupervisors. She can make simple work-related decisions, and can have up to\noccasional change in work setting. The claimant cannot travel to unfamiliar\nplaces as part of work responsibilities.\n\n6. The claimant is unable to perform any past relevant work (20 CFR 404.1565).\n\n7. The claimant... was 44 years old, which is defined as a younger individual\nage 18-49, on the alleged disability onset date (20 CFR 404.1563).\n\n8. The claimant has at least a high school education and is able to communicate\nin English (20 CFR 404.1564).\n\n9. Transferability of job skills is not material to the determination of disability\nbecause using the Medical-Vocational Rules as a framework supports a\n\n10\nfinding that the claimant is \u201cnot disabled,\u201d whether or not the claimant has\ntransferable job skills (See SSR 82-41 and 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P,\nAppendix 2).\n10. Considering the claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and residual\nfunctional capacity, there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the\nnational economy that the claimant can perform (20 CFR 404.1569 and\n404.1569a).\n11. The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security\nAct, from January 18, 2017, through the date of this decision (20 CFR\n404.1520(g)).\n(I. 11 at 16-24)\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nJudicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial\nevidence supports the decision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Biestek v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1148,\n1154 (2019). \u201cSubstantial evidence means enough relevant evidence that \u2018a reasonable mind\n\n999\n\nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d Pearson v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 839 F.\nApp\u2019x 684, 687 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154). When applying the\nsubstantial evidence standard, the court \u201clooks to an existing administrative record and asks\nwhether it contains \u2018sufficien[t] evidence\u2019 to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d\nBiestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).\nThe threshold for satisfying the substantial evidence standard is \u201cnot high[,]\u201d requiring \u201cmore\nthan a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. Id.\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Disability Determination Process\n\nTitle II of the Social Security Act \u201cprovides for the payment of insurance benefits to\n\npersons who have contributed to the program and who suffer from a physical or mental\n\ndisability.\u201d Bowen v. Yuckert, 482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987). A disability is defined for purposes of\n\n11\nDIB as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically\ndeterminable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which\nhas lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is only disabled if the impairments are so severe that they\npreclude a return to previous work or engagement in any other kind of substantial gainful work\nexisting in the national economy. Jd. at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 21-22\n(2003).\n\nThe Commissioner must perform a five-step analysis to determine whether a person is\ndisabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 427-28 (3d Cir. 1999). If\nthe Commissioner makes a finding of disability or non-disability at any point in the sequential\nprocess, the Commissioner will not review the claim further. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). At\nstep one, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant is engaged in any substantial\ngainful activity. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is not engaged in substantial\ngainful activity, step two requires the Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is\nsuffering from a severe impairment or a severe combination of impairments. See id. at \u00a7\n404.1520(a)(4)(ii).\n\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, at step three, the Commissioner compares the\nclaimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments that are presumed severe enough to preclude any\ngainful work. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. When a claimant\u2019s\nimpairment or its equivalent matches a listed impairment, the claimant is presumed disabled. See\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). Ifa claimant\u2019s impairment, either singly or in combination, fails\nto meet or medically equal any listing, the analysis continues to steps four and five. See id. at \u00a7\n\n404.1520(e).\n\n12\nAt step four, the ALJ considers whether the claimant retains the residual functional\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv); Plummer, 186\nF.3d at 428. A claimant\u2019s RFC \u201cmeasures the most she can do despite her limitations.\u201d Zirnsak\nv. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1)) (internal\nquotations and alterations omitted). The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating the inability\nto return to past relevant work. See Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428.\n\nIf the claimant is unable to return to past relevant work, at step five, the Commissioner\nmust demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s impairments do not preclude an adjustment to any other\navailable work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. In other words, the\nCommissioner must prove that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the\nnational economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments, age,\neducation, past work experience, and [RFC].\u201d Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. The ALJ must\nanalyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he or she\nis capable of performing work and is not disabled. See id. The ALJ often seeks the VE\u2019s\nassistance in making this finding. See id.\n\nB. Whether the ALJ\u2019s Decision is Supported by Substantial Evidence\n\nPlaintiff challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision in multiple respects: (1) the ALJ failed to include\nthe impact of Plaintiff agoraphobia in the RFC analysis; (2) the ALJ erred in accepting a non-\nexamining state agency psychologist\u2019s report over the opinion of Plaintiff treating psychiatrist;\n(3) the ALJ improperly weighed the subjective evidence; (4) the ALJ did not properly develop\nthe record regarding Plaintiff more recent brain pathology; (5) remand is necessary to consider\nadditional medical evidence proximate to the hearing before the ALJ; and (6) the appointment of\n\nthe prior Commissioner, Andrew Saul, violated the separation of powers. (D.I. 21 at 1)\n\n13\n1. Assessment of Plaintiff\u2019s agoraphobia\n\nPlaintiff contends that the ALJ failed to make any provision in the RFC for Plaintiff's\nsevere agoraphobia, which frequently prevents her from getting out of bed and/or out of her\nhouse. (D.I. 23 at 18) In response, the Commissioner argues that the ALJ properly assessed\nPlaintiffs agoraphobia as a severe impairment, while noting that the record failed to support any\nadditional functional limitations beyond those included in the RFC. (D.I. 30 at 14-15)\n\nThe ALJ did not err in declining to include additional RFC limitations specific to\nPlaintiff's agoraphobia. The Third Circuit has described agoraphobia as \u201can intense, irrational\nfear of open spaces, characterized by a marked fear of being alone or of being in public places\nwhere escape would be difficult and may be associated with panic attacks.\u201d Thelosen v. Comm\u2019r\nof Soc. Sec., 384 F. App\u2019x 86, 90 n.4 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Med.\nDictionary at 40 (30th ed. 2003)). The ALJ accounted for this condition in Plaintiff's RFC by\nrestricting her from travel to unfamiliar places as part of her work responsibilities and limiting\nher to simple work-related decisions, occasional changes in work setting, and occasional\ninteraction with others. (D.I. 11 at 18) Plaintiff suggests that these limitations address her other\nsevere impairments, and not her agoraphobia. (D.I. 31 at 3-4) But limitations on Plaintiff's\nwork setting and interactions with others are consistent with the definition of agoraphobia.\nMoreover, it is widely recognized that the symptoms and resulting limitations of mental\nimpairments often overlap. See Witherspoon v. Saul, 2019 WL 5188564, at *7 n.6 (E.D. Pa. Oct.\n15, 2019) (finding no error in ALJ\u2019s failure to separately identify each mental health disorder\n\u201cbecause of their overlapping symptoms and the possibility of multiple characterizations of a\npatient\u2019s mental health disorder.\u201d); see also Peter W. v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2022 WL 523744,\n\nat *8 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2022); Athena G. v. Kijakazi, 2021 WL 3729033, at *10-11 (N.D. Tex.\n\n14\nAug. 2, 2021); Marilyn R. v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2019 WL 4891703, at *4 (C.D. Ill. July 18,\n2019).\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision not to credit Plaintiff's claim that she\ncould not leave the house, and Plaintiff fails to identify any other limitations resulting from her\nagoraphobia that were not included in the RFC. The ALJ considered Plaintiff's own statements\nthat she can drive occasionally, go to doctor\u2019s appointments, shop, spend time with family and\nfriends, and attend church on a weekly basis. (D.I. 11 at 17-18, 21, 55, 65, 67, 226) The ALJ\nalso considered Plaintiff's treatment notes from her frequent medical appointments outside the\nhome, which generally confirm that she engaged normally in activities of daily living. (See, e.g.,\nid. at 373-95, 413-52, 460-534) Plaintiff's demonstrated ability to engage in these activities\nconflicts with her own statements and those of Ms. Watson that Plaintiff has difficulty leaving\nher house. (Jd. at 58-59, 64, 262) The ALJ was, therefore, entitled to credit the portions of\nPlaintiff's testimony that were consistent with the medical evidence and to conclude that there\nwere no credibly established limitations regarding her alleged difficulties leaving the house. See\nRutherford v. Barnhart, 399 F.3d 546, 554 (3d Cir. 2005) (explaining that the ALJ can reject\nlimitations that are asserted by the claimant but lack objective medical support if there is\nconflicting evidence in the record); see also Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 615 (3d Cir. 2014)\n(\u201c[T]he ALJ is only required to submit credibly established limitations.\u201d).\n\n2. Assessment of medical opinion evidence\n\nPlaintiff argues that the ALJ erred in crediting the reports of two non-examining state\nagency psychologists over the opinions of her treating psychiatrist. (D.I. 23 at 18-19) But the\nCommissioner correctly explains, and Plaintiff does not dispute, that the treating source rule does\n\nnot apply to Plaintiff's DIB claim, which was filed after the enactment of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c\n\n15\nin March 2017. (D.I. 30 at 16-17; D.I. 31 at 5) Under the new regulations, the ALJ need not\n\u201cdefer or give any specific evidentiary weight, including controlling weight, to any medical\nopinion(s) . . ., including those from [the claimant\u2019s] medical sources.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.1520c(a).\n\nPlaintiff submits that the ALJ failed to consider 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(c)(5), which\naddresses the consideration of \u201cother factors that tend to support or contradict a medical\nopinion[.]\u201d (D.I. 23 at 19) Such factors include, among other things, the medical source\u2019s\nunderstanding of the applicable policies and evidentiary requirements. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.1520c(c)(5). Here, the ALJ indicated that the state agency consultants\u2019 opinions were\n\u201cbased upon . . . a comprehensive understanding of agency rules and regulations.\u201d (D.I. 11 at\n21-22) Plaintiff challenges the accuracy of this statement, suggesting that \u201cit is highly\nquestionable that these consultants can be said to be familiar with agency rules and regulations.\u201d*\n(D.I. 23 at 19) But this was not the only\u2014or even the primary\u2014factor considered by the ALJ in\ndetermining that the opinions of the state agency consultants were persuasive. Instead, the ALJ\nfocused on the internal consistency of the state agency consultants\u2019 opinions and their\nconsistency with Plaintiff's treatment records as a whole, as well as the supportability of those\nopinions \u201cby a reasonable explanation and the available evidence[.]\u201d (D.I. 11 at 22)\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s assessment of the state agency consultants\u2019\n\nopinions in this regard. Treatment notes from Dr. Afzal consistently confirm that Plaintiff's\n\n5 In support of her contention, Plaintiff cites a November 9, 2021 report published by the\nGovernment Accountability Office, which suggested that the qualifications and knowledge of\nstate agency doctors are often not appropriately vetted in accordance with the policy of the\nSocial Security Administration. (D.I. 23 at 19) However, Plaintiff offers no evidence to suggest\nthat the state agency consultants who rendered opinions in this particular case lacked the\nrequisite qualifications or familiarity with agency rules and regulations.\n\n16\ncognitive functioning, fund of knowledge, short- and long-term memory, judgment, and abstract\nthinking remained intact, and Plaintiff was friendly, attentive, cooperative, and communicative\nduring her visits. (D.I. 11 at 413-50, 529-33, 542-70) These assessments support the\nconclusions of the state agency consultants and the ALJ that Plaintiff could understand and\nremember simple instructions and adapt to simple changes in a low contact work setting. (/d. at\n21, 88-89, 102-04) Accordingly, the ALJ satisfied the regulatory requirement to articulate his\nsupportability and consistency findings under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c. There is no corresponding\nrequirement that the ALJ discuss the remaining factors.\u2019 See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2);\nBordner v. Kijakazi, 2022 WL 178818, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 18, 2022). Nonetheless, the ALJ in\nthis case acknowledged that the state agency consultants were non-treating, non-examining\nmedical sources, and he thoroughly discussed the records of Plaintiff's treating providers to\nsupply context regarding their specialties and the length and nature of their treatment\nrelationships with Plaintiff and to explain the weight given to each opinion. (D.I. 11 at 20-22);\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(c)(3)-(4).\n\nPlaintiff contends that the state agency consultants did not have the benefit of reviewing\nany medical records after November 2017, and the ALJ\u2019s assignment of persuasive value to\n\nthose opinions was therefore erroneous. (D.I. 23 at 19) But the Third Circuit has recognized\n\n7 Plaintiff posits that, despite the language of \u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2) absolving the ALJ of expressly\ndiscussing factors beyond supportability and consistency, this Court should reimpose an\narticulation requirement regarding those factors. (D.I. 23 at 20-21; D.I. 31 at 5) The ALJ is\nlegally bound to follow the regulations. See Orr v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 805 F. App\u2019x 85, 87 (3d\nCir. 2020); Wright v. Colvin, 2016 WL 446876, at *1 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 14, 2016). Plaintiff cites no\nauthority suggesting that this Court may remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to impose\nan articulation requirement that expressly contradicts the applicable regulations. As discussed\nherein, the ALJ explained why he found certain opinions more persuasive than others based on\ncitations to the evidentiary record. He did not \u201creject evidence for no reason or the wrong\nreason\u201d in this regard. Mason v. Shalala, 994 F.2d 1058, 1066 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n17\nthat, \u201cbecause state agency review precedes ALJ review, there is always some time lapse\nbetween the consultant\u2019s report and the ALJ hearing and decision. The Social Security\nregulations impose no limit on how much time may pass between a report and the ALJ\u2019s decision\nin reliance on it.\u201d Chandler v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d 356, 361 (3d Cir. 2011). Here, the\nALJ considered Plaintiff's medical records post-dating the state agency consultants\u2019 opinions\nand determined that, although Plaintiff experienced some withdrawal symptoms and persistent\nanxiety, she continued to exhibit overall normal findings on mental status examination, and she\nwas able to work fourteen hours per week. (D.I. 11 at 21) Specifically, the ALJ noted that\nPlaintiff \u201cexhibited intact memory, normal cognitive functioning, insight and judgment, no signs\nof hyperactive or attentional difficulties, normal attention and behavior, but with signs of\nanxiety\u201d in her treatment records throughout 2018. (/d.) The ALJ expressly considered these\nsubsequent treatment records in conjunction with the state agency consultants\u2019 opinions and\ndetermined that the records and opinions were consistent. (/d. at 21-22) Thus, substantial\nevidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit the opinions of the state agency consultants\ndespite the age of those opinions. See Chandler, 667 F.3d at 361 (\u201cOnly where \u2018additional\nmedical evidence is received that in the opinion of the [ALJ] ... may change the State agency\nmedical . . . consultant\u2019s finding that the impairment(s) is not equivalent in severity to any\nimpairment in the Listing,\u2019 is an update to the report required.\u201d (citing S.S.R. 96-6p, 1996 WL\n374180, at *4 (July 2, 1996)).\n\nPlaintiff also challenges the ALJ\u2019s finding that the opinion of Plaintiff's treating\npsychiatrist, Dr. Afzal, was less persuasive. (D.I. 23 at 18-19) But the ALJ correctly stated that\nDr. Afzal\u2019s opinions regarding Plaintiff's ability to work address an issue reserved for the\n\nCommissioner. (D.I. 11 at 22) Accordingly, the ALJ was not obligated to assign any weight to\n\n18\nDr. Afzal\u2019s statements that Plaintiff would not be able to work on a full-time basis for six to\ntwelve months, or that she could work on a part-time basis for ten hours per week. See Hoyman\nv. Colvin, 606 F. App\u2019x 678, 680-81 (3d Cir. 2015).\n\nMoreover, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Afzal\u2019s opinion\nwas inconsistent with Plaintiff's treatment records and the opinions of the state agency\nconsultants and Ms. Beiso. (D.I. 11 at 22) The ALJ cited ongoing treatment records from Dr.\nAfzal showing conservative treatment, stable or improved symptoms, normal activities of daily\nliving, and a good prognosis with continued therapy. (/d. at 22, 413-50, 542-70) Even on\noccasions when Plaintiff's symptoms worsened, Dr. Afzal noted that her cognitive functioning,\nmemory, and judgment remained intact. (Jd. at 447) The ALJ observed that Ms. Beiso\u2019s\nopinions were also inconsistent with Dr. Afzal\u2019s assessments because she suggested that Plaintiff\ncould return to work only a few months after her disability onset date. (/d. at 22, 605, 611)\nIndeed, Ms. Beiso completed a health appraisal form clearing Plaintiff to work in a childcare\nposition. (/d. at 593) Likewise, Dr. Afzal\u2019s opinion that Plaintiff could only work part-time is\ninconsistent with the opinions of the state agency consultants that Plaintiff was not disabled. (ld.\nat 85-91, 100-05)\n\n3. Assessment of the subjective evidence\n\nPlaintiff challenges the ALJ\u2019s use of boilerplate language in assessing Plaintiffs\nsubjective complaints, arguing that the ALJ was required to either credit Plaintiffs subjective\ncomplaints or point to other credible medical opinions refuting those complaints once he found\nthat her medically determinable impairments could cause her symptoms. (D.I. 23 at 21-22) The\nCommissioner responds that the ALJ properly considered inconsistencies within Plaintiff's own\n\nstatements, as well as treatment notes that did not support the severity of symptoms claimed by\n\n19\nPlaintiff and evidence showing that Plaintiff was able to work during the relevant time period.\n(DL. 23 at 22-24)\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s analysis of Plaintiff's subjective complaints is in keeping with the applicable\nstandard set forth in Social Security Ruling 16-3p,*\u00ae which requires examination of \u201cthe entire\ncase record, including the objective medical evidence; an individual\u2019s statements about the\nintensity, persistence, and limiting effects of symptoms; statements and other information\nprovided by medical sources and other persons; and any other relevant evidence in the\nindividual\u2019s case record.\u201d S.S.R. 16-3p, 2017 WL 5180304, at *4 (Oct. 25, 2017).\n\nThe ALJ found that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s medically determinable impairments could\nreasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms; however, the claimant\u2019s statements\nconcerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely\nconsistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record for the reasons explained\nin this decision.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 19-20) Cases involving similar \u201cboilerplate\u201d language have held\nthat an ALJ\u2019s assessment of a claimant\u2019s credibility is supported by substantial evidence when it\nis based on a thorough examination of the overall record revealing issues such as inconsistencies\nin the claimant\u2019s testimony and minimal clinical findings. See Schuster v. Astrue, 879 F. Supp.\n\n2d 461, 471 (E.D. Pa. 2012); see also Kellie F. v. Kijakazi, 2022 WL 203242, at *16 (D.N.J. Jan.\n\n8 Plaintiff relies on the Third Circuit\u2019s line of cases addressing the evaluation of a claimant\u2019s\nsubjective complaints of physical pain. (D.I. 23 at 21-22) (quoting Mason v. Shalala, 994 F.2d\n1058, 1067-68 (3d Cir. 1993); citing Gross v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 653 F. App\u2019x 116 (3d Cir.\n2016); Zielinski v. Astrue, 2013 WL 6547229 (M.D. Pa. 2013)). Plaintiff's allegations in this\ncase concern her mental impairments, as opposed to physical pain. At least one district within\nthe Third Circuit has declined to extend this line of cases to cases involving subjective\ncomplaints of mental impairments. See Warren v. Astrue, 2008 WL 4748349, at *7 (E.D. Pa.\nOct. 29, 2008) (\u201cThe Third Circuit has not extended Mason . . . principles beyond subjective\ncomplaints of pain; therefore, this court also declines to do so.\u201d). Other courts within the Third\nCircuit have not drawn this distinction. See, e.g., Brenizer v. Astrue, 2012 WL 4006238, at *5\n(W.D. Pa. Sept. 12, 2012).\n\n20\n24, 2022). Reliance on boilerplate language does not inevitably lead to a deficient administrative\nanalysis where, as here, the ALJ proceeds to consider the evidence on the record as a whole.\n\nImmediately following the boilerplate language, the ALJ proceeds to consider\n\u201cclaimant\u2019s statements about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of... her symptoms\u201d\nin the context of \u201cthe totality of the evidence of record.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 20) This includes\nconsideration and analysis of Plaintiff's hearing testimony and written statements, third-party\nstatements, the opinions of state agency consultants and Plaintiff's providers, Plaintiff's work\nhistory during the relevant time period, and treatment records revealing a conservative course of\ntreatment and overall stable mental status findings. (/d. at 16, 19-22) For the reasons previously\ndiscussed at \u00a7 III.B.1-2, supra, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that\nPlaintiff's subjective complaints are not entirely consistent with this evidence. Contrary to\nPlaintiff's suggestion, the ALJ did not rely on his own lay opinion in rejecting her subjective\ncomplaints. (D.I. 23 at 22) Rather, the ALJ relied on contradictory medical and other evidence\nthat included, among other things, the conservative nature of Plaintiffs treatment and stable\nmental status examination findings. (D.I. 11 at 19-22) Because the Commissioner\u2019s decision\nregarding Plaintiffs subjective complaints is supported by substantial evidence, it will be\naffirmed in this regard.\n\n4. Duty to develop the administrative record\n\nPlaintiff next argues that the ALJ had a duty to develop the record once Plaintiff testified\nthat she had recently been seen in the hospital for brain pathology, which may contribute to\nPlaintiff's mental health problems. (D.I. 23 at 23-24) The Commissioner responds that the ALJ\n\nwas not obligated to consider any evidence submitted later than five business days before the\n\n21\nhearing, and Plaintiff did not submit any additional written evidence at the hearing. (D.I. 30 at\n25)\n\nThe ALJ did not err in failing to further develop the record in this case. Under the\nregulations, a claimant must submit any evidence to the ALJ no fewer than five business days\nbefore the scheduled administrative hearing. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.935(a); Delpizzo v. Saul, 2021 WL\n2651949, at *13-14 (D.N.J. June 28, 2021). There is no dispute in this case that Plaintiff did not\nsubmit written evidence of her 2019 emergency room visit for consideration by the ALJ at any\npoint in the administrative proceedings, nor did she request postponement of the hearing before\nthe ALJ. Instead, Plaintiff submitted the written evidence for the first time to this court on\nappeal in December 2021 in conjunction with the filing of her summary judgment motion. (D.I.\n22-1) Plaintiff suggests that an exception to the five-day rule applies under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.935(b)(3) because her inability to submit the evidence in a timely manner was due to\n\u201c[s]ome other unusual, unexpected, or unavoidable circumstance\u201d beyond her control which\nprevented her from informing the ALJ about the evidence or submitting the evidence earlier.\n(D.I. 23 at 24 n.23); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.935(b)(3). But Plaintiff does not offer any explanation or\nidentify any efforts made to submit her emergency room records to the ALJ prior to the date of\nthe written decision. The exceptions to the five-day rule apply only to the ALJ\u2019s consideration\nof untimely evidence and, in this case, it is undisputed that the ALJ was never presented with the\nwritten records from Plaintiff's 2019 emergency room visit.\n\nThe crux of Plaintiff's argument is that the ALJ had a duty to independently develop the\nrecord regarding her emergency room visit after Plaintiff mentioned it in her testimony during\nthe administrative hearing. (D.I. 23 at 23-24) The ALJ has a duty to develop the medical record,\n\nbut the duty only arises when there is insufficient evidence to make a rational decision. See\n\n22\nConley v. Colvin, 2016 WL 3436435, at *10 (D. Del. June 20, 2016) (citing Clark v. Shalala, 28\nF.3d 828 (8th Cir. 1994)). Plaintiff has not established that the evidence before the ALJ was\ninsufficient to render a decision.\n\nMoreover, the ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the administrative record does not absolve Plaintiff\nor her counsel of all responsibility for developing the record. See Turby v. Barnhart, 54 F.\nApp\u2019x 118, 122-23 (3d Cir. 2002) (explaining that the ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the record \u201cis most\nacute where the claimant is unrepresented[.]\u201d); Moore v. Astrue, 851 F. Supp. 2d 1131, 1144-45\n(N.D. Ill. 2012) (finding that neither plaintiff nor counsel made an effort to submit proof in the\nmonth following the hearing and instead \u201csimply contented themselves with idle and\nirresponsible castigation of the ALJ.\u201d). Statements made by Plaintiff's counsel during the\nhearing indicate that counsel was in possession of Plaintiff's discharge papers at the time of the\nhearing, yet no motion was made to submit them into evidence or continue the hearing. (D.I. 11\nat 53) (\u201c[S]o her testimony will be she had a brief inpatient stay at the end of April and she just\nbrought the discharge papers for me to look at to see what it was all about. And it turns out that\nshe was diagnosed with migraine headache.\u201d). On this record, the ALJ had no duty to further\ndevelop the evidence regarding Plaintiff's 2019 emergency room visit. See Clark v. Astrue, C.A.\nNo. 12-1116-RGA, 2013 WL 4407880, at *1 (D. Del. Aug. 15, 2013) (concluding that ALJ did\nnot err in failing to consider evidence arising after the administrative hearing where the claimant\nwas represented by counsel, no request for a continuance was made, and the ALJ had sufficient\n\nevidence to issue a decision).\n\n23\n5. Duty to consider additional medical evidence\n\nIn the alternative, Plaintiff seeks relief pursuant to the sixth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n405(g), which provides that the court may remand the case for consideration of additional\nevidence. (D.I. 23 at 25) Plaintiff suggests that the 2019 emergency room records submitted in\nconjunction with her motion for summary judgment support a theory that her pituitary disorder\nmay be correlated to her panic disorder. (Jd. at 26-28) However, Plaintiff concedes that this\nremedy \u201cis very infrequently applied.\u201d (D.I. 31 at 9)\n\nUnder the sixth sentence of \u00a7 405(g), a court may remand an agency determination to\nrequire the ALJ to consider new evidence only if the claimant establishes \u201cthat there is new\nevidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such\nevidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Putting aside the issue of\nwhether the evidence is \u201cnew,\u201d Plaintiff has not met the good cause or materiality standards here.\nCounsel was in possession of Plaintiff's discharge papers at the time of the hearing. (D.I. 11 at\n53) This testimony contradicts Plaintiffs explanations for her failure to acquire any additional\nmedical documentation prior to the administrative hearing, and it establishes that Plaintiff cannot\nmake the necessary showing of good cause. See Scatorchia v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 137 F.\nApp\u2019x 468, 472 (3d Cir. 2005) (observing that remands for each item of new and material\nevidence \u201cwould open the door for claimants to withhold evidence from the ALJ in order to\npreserve a reason for remand.\u201d). Moreover, Plaintiff has not shown that the new evidence is\nmaterial because a review of the emergency room records fails to establish a relationship\nbetween Plaintiff's headaches and her mental impairments. (D.I. 22-1) Plaintiffs speculation\n\nthat this diagnosis could be an underlying cause of her mental impairments finds no support in\n\n24\nthe records themselves. (D.I. 23 at 26-28) Consequently, Plaintiff has not shown that her 2019\nemergency room records were likely to change the ALJ\u2019s decision.\n6. Constitutionality of the Commissioner\u2019s appointment\n\nPlaintiff alleges that the ALJ\u2019s determination in this case is constitutionally defective\nbecause the appointment of the former Commissioner, Andrew Saul, violated the Appointments\nClause of the Constitution. (D.I. 23 at 29-30) Specifically, Plaintiff contends that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n902(a)(3) violates the separation of powers to the extent that it limits the President\u2019s authority to\nremove the Commissioner without cause. (/d.) Plaintiff acknowledges in her reply brief that she\n\u201cjs not aware of any case in which relief has been granted based upon these arguments although\nit certainly seems that such should be granted.\u201d\u00ae (D.I. 31 at 2)\n\nThe Commissioner concedes that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(a)(3) violates the separation of powers.\n(D.L. 30 at 4) Nonetheless, the Commissioner argues that an unfavorable decision by the ALJ\ncannot be set aside in this case because Plaintiff has not shown that the unconstitutional statutory\nremoval restriction actually caused her harm. (Jd. at 5-10) The Supreme Court has determined\nthat the unlawfulness of a removal provision does not strip [an official] of the power to undertake\nthe other responsibilities of his office[.]\u201d Collins v. Yellen, 141 S. Ct. 1761, 1788 n.23 (2021)\n(citing Seila Law LLC v. C.F.P.B, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2207-11 (2020)). Accordingly, \u201cplaintiffs\nalleging a removal violation are entitled to injunctive relief\u2014a rewinding of agency action\u2014only\nwhen the President\u2019s inability to fire an agency head affected the complained-of decision.\u201d Jd. at\n\n1801 (Kagan, J., concurring). Plaintiff does not articulate how the President\u2019s inability to\n\n9 On the other hand, the Commissioner has provided string citations to numerous cases in which\nDistrict Courts across the country have rejected remands for lack of a connection to the ALJ\u2019s\ndetermination. See, e.g., Kowalski v. Kijakazi, 2022 WL 526094, at *9-12 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 22,\n2022); High v. Kijakazi, 2022 WL 394750, at *5-6 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 9, 2022); Mor v. Kijakazi,\n2022 WL 73510, at *#3-5 (D.N.J. Jan. 7, 2022).\n\n25\nremove the Commissioner without cause affected the ALJ\u2019s disability determination in this case.\nSee Decker Coal Co. v. Pehringer, 8 F.4th 1123, 1138 (9th Cir. 2021) (\u201c[TJhere is no link\nbetween the ALJ\u2019s decision awarding benefits and the allegedly unconstitutional removal\nprovisions. And nothing commands us to vacate the decisions below on that ground.\u201d). Absent\na showing of actual harm, Plaintiff cannot prevail on this issue.\n\nMoreover, the Commissioner submits that the ALJ in this case had his appointment\nratified in July 2018 by former Acting Commissioner of Social Security Berryhill, who did not\nenjoy statutory tenure protection, was not subject to \u00a7 902(a)(3)\u2019s removal restriction, and could\nhave been removed by the President at any time. (D.I. 30 at 6-7) And the ALJ\u2019s decision in this\ncase issued on May 20, 2019, about a month before Andrew Saul took office as the\nCommissioner. (Jd. at 7) Plaintiff does not challenge these assertions. Under similar\ncircumstances, courts have determined that constitutional removal restriction arguments do not\napply. See Boger v. Kijakazi, 2021 WL 5023141, at *3 n.4 (W.D.N.C. Oct. 28, 2021); see also\nStandifird v. Kijakazi, 2021 WL 5634177, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 1, 2021); Perez-Kocher v.\nComm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2021 WL 6334838, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 23, 2021).\n\nThe Commissioner alternatively argues that Plaintiff's request for a rehearing based on\nthe Appointments Clause deficiency should be denied under the harmless error doctrine, the de\nfacto officer doctrine, the rule of necessity, and broad prudential considerations. (D.I. 30 at 10-\n13) Having determined that the unconstitutional statutory removal restriction did not actually\n\ncause Plaintiff harm, the court need not reach these alternative arguments.\n\n26\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (D.I. 22) is\nDENIED, and the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment (D.I. 28) is GRANTED.\n\nAn Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nDated: April 5, 2022\nSherry R.\nUnited\n\n27\n"}
