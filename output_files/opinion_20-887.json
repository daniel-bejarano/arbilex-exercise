Civil Action No. 20-887-GBW \nASC ENGINEERED SOLUTIONS , LLC, \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nOn July 21, 2022, Defendant ASC Engineered Solutions (\"ASC\") filed a Motion for \nBifurcation ohhis action (\"the Motion\"). D.I. 258. ASC has proposed that, before the Court tries \npatent infringement , invalidity , and damages to a jury, the Court should first try several of ASC's \ncontract-related defenses to a jury or via a bench trial: (1) ASC's counterclaim that \"seeks a judicial \ndeclaration that all of [Defendant] Victaulic[] [Compan y's (\"Victualic \")] patent infringement \nclaims are barred by the license grant or the covenant not to sue, or both, under the\" Settlement \nand License Agreement , Release, and Covenant Not to Sue between the parties to this suit-and \nrelated corporations-with an effective date of October 12, 2016 (the \"Settlement Agreement ,\" \nD.I. 22, Ex. A.); (2) ASC's defense \"that this suit is barred by the Settlement Agreement \"; and (3) \nASC's counterclaim that Victaulic breached the Settlement Agreement when it brought this suit. \nSee D.I. 259 at 4. Victaulic opposes bifurcation on efficiency and fairness grounds. D.I. 261 at 2. \nASC has requested oral argument as to the Motion. D.I. 265. \nThe Settlement Agreement selects Delaware law. D.I. 22, Ex. A \u00a7 11.5. Under Delaware \nlaw, \"[t]he proper interpretation of language in a contract, while analytically a question of fact, is treated as a question oflaw .... \" Stone v. Nationstar Mortg. LLC, 2020 WL 4037337, at *5 (Del. \nCh. July 6, 2020) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Settlement Agreement \ngrants ASC a license to sell \"any Anvil Product\" worldwide. D.I. 22, Ex. A\u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.6. Victaulic \nalso agrees not to sue ASC \"in connection with the manufacture , use, offer to sell, sale, importation \nor other disposition of any Anvil Product [worldwide] ... during\" the life of, among others, U.S. \nPatent No. 7,712,796 (\"the '796 patent\"). Id at\u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.5, 9.1. The '796 patent is now \"the sole \npatent-in-suit.\" D.I. 259 at 1. \"Anvil Product\" is defined as follows: \nAnvil International ' s SlideLOK couplings of all current ( and future sizes which are \nscaled versions of current sizes) as listed in and illustrated by the drawings in \nSchedule A ... (the \"Listed Couplings \"), including variations thereof, such \nvariations including , updates or improvements thereto and future versions or \nrevisions thereof ... ; provided that such variations do not: (a) result in a coupling \nthat is more than colorably different from the Listed Couplings relative to \nVictaulic's patented structural features, appearance , functionality , or method of \nassembly ; or (b) result in a coupling that is the same as, or only colorably different \nfrom, the Current Victaulic Couplings relative to Victaulic ' s patented structural \nfeatures, appearance, functionali ty, or method of assembly . \nD.I. 22, Ex. A\u00a7 1. The Court has not yet provided a final interpretation of \"Anvil Product.\" See \nTr. ofHr'g of Dec. 17, 2021, at 48:20--49:6 (discussing the possibility that the Court would need \nto consider extrinsic evidence because the parties \"didn't have a meeting of the minds\"). \nOn November 18, 2020, the Court scheduled a final pretrial conference for September 28, \n2022 at 3:00 PM. D.I. 31. After the completion of claim construction (D.I. 124) and fact discovery \n(D.I. 259 at 1), the denial of an early motion for summary judgment (D.I. 110) on the contract \nissues (D.I. 259 at 1), and the submission of the parties' pretrial order (D.I. 269) and proposed jury \ninstructions (D.I. 270; D.I. 271; D.I. 272; D.I. 273; D.I. 274), this case was reassigned to Judge \nGregory Williams on September 7, 2022. Pending now are Victaulic ' s three Motions for Summary \nJudgment (D.I. 193; D.I. 197; D.I. 201), ASC's Motion to Exclude certain opinions ofVictaulic 's \nexpert witnesses (D.I. 212), the Motion, and pretrial matters (e.g., D.I. 269; D.I. 270). \n2 The Court cannot address the parties' outstanding motions and be prepared to resolve \noutstanding pretrial issues by September 28, 2022. Instead, the Court will use this time to hear \noral argument on ASC's Motion. The Court asks that the parties come prepared to discuss a two\u00ad\npart trial in which one jury shall consider contract issues and another jury, if necessary and sitting \nlater, shall consider patent infringement , invalidity , and damages. \nTo assist the Court in its review of the Motion, the Court asks that ASC provide letter \nbriefing of no more than three (3) pages on the definition of \"Anvil Product\" by 5:00 PM on \nWednesday , September 21, 2022. The letter briefing shall (1) specify a proposed definition of \n\"Anvil Product\" that the Court would use to instruct the jury, (2) provide citations to case law and \nthe docket in support of the proposed definition , (3) explain whether, and, if so, why, the Court \nmust consider extrinsic evidence to construe the definition, and ( 4) explain whether the Court must \nincorporate language from the '796 patent into its definition. Victaulic shall provide responsive \nletter briefing of no more than three (3) pages by 5:00 PM on Friday, September 23, 2022 that \nincludes its own proposed definition , addresses the same topics, and responds to ASC's briefing. \nThe parties shall provide three (3) paper courtesy copies of any briefing and cited docket entries \nthat are pertinent to the Court's review thereof. \nWHEREFORE , at Wilmington this 19th day of September 2022, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that the parties shall appear on September 28, 2022 at 3 :00 PM in Courtroom 6B for \noral argument on ASC's Motion for Bifurcation (D.I. 258) and that the parties shall provide letter \nbriefing to the Court on the topics and in accordance with the sche e set forth above. \n3 GREGORYB.
