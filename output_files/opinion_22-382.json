Jackson\n\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 22-382-RGA\nROBERT MAY, et al.,\nDefendants.\n\nRahim B. Majid, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware.\nPro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nOctober \u2018a 2022\n\nWilmington, Delaware\nplang Wl\nNDREWS, en District Judge:\n|\n\nPlaintiff Rahim B. Majid, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in\nSmyrna, Delaware, filed this action on March 24, 2022, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\n(D.1. 1 at 27-32). Plaintiff filed a declaration on April 21, 2022, and a supplemental\ncomplaint on July 25, 2022. (D.I. 9, 13). Plaintiff appears pro se and proceeds in forma\npauperis. He requests counsel. (D.|. 3). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff has been in DOC custody since January 13, 1998. (D.I. 1 at 6). Itis not\nclear how long of a sentence he is serving.' What is clear is that he would like to be\nreleased early through a process outlined in 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217:\n\n(a) In any case where the trial court has imposed an aggregate sentence of\nincarceration at Level V in excess of 1 year, the court shall retain jurisdiction to\n\nmodify the sentence to reduce the level of custody or time to be served under the\nprovisions of this section.\n\n(b) The court may modify the sentence solely on the basis of an application filed by\nthe Department of Correction for good cause shown which certifies that the release\nof the defendant shall not constitute a substantial risk to the community or the\ndefendant\u2019s own self.\n\n(c) Good cause under this section shall include, but not be limited to, rehabilitation of\nthe offender, serious medical illness or infirmity of the offender and prison\novercrowding.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, in the case of any\noffender who is serving a sentence of incarceration at Level V imposed pursuant to a\n\n1 Per the Delaware Supreme Court, his sentence is thirty-seven years, but the prison\nportion was suspended after twenty-seven years. Jackson v. State, No. 457, 2007\n(Order) (Del. April 23, 2008). One of the convictions is for attempted first degree\nmurder, which is a class A felony under Delaware law. There are other convictions,\nincluding possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and robbery 1*,\nboth of which also have a minimum-mandatory component to them.\n\nconviction for any crime, the Court may order that said offender shail be ineligible for\nsentence modification pursuant to this section until a specified portion of said Level V\nsentence has been served, except that no offender who is serving a sentence of\nincarceration at Level V imposed pursuant to a conviction for a violent felony in Title\n11 shall be eligible for sentence modification pursuant to this section until the\noffender has served at least '/2 of the originally imposed Level V sentence, and no\noffender who is serving a statutory mandatory term of incarceration at Level V\nimposed pursuant to a conviction for any offense set forth in Title 11 shall be eligible\nfor sentence modification pursuant to this section during the mandatory portion of\nsaid sentence.\n\nPlaintiff generally alleges that Defendants have refused to file a \u00a7 4217\napplication on his behalf for various reasons, including that one of his convictions is for\na class A felony, and that he has infuriated the powers that be by filing motions in\nSuperior Court in connection with his desire to have the DOC file a \u00a7 4217 application\non his behalf. He generally asserts the refusal constitutes retaliation, due process, and\nequal protection claims in violation of the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the United States Constitution and the Delaware Constitution. (D.I. 1).\n\nThe Complaint contains seven counts against eight Defendants, as follows:\n\nCounts | and Il, violations of the right to petition, right to access the\ncourts, and right to due process under the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments and the Delaware Constitution against Warden Robert May,\nDeputy Warden Phil Parker, Deputy Warden Natasha Hollingsworth,\nClassification Officer and/or Treatment Administrator Stacey Hollis, Master\nCounselor and/or Counselor Supervisor Laretta Edwards, Classification\nLieutenant Mark Daum, Counselor or Master Counselor Thongvong, and\nCounselor or Master Counselor Katherine Sanders;\n\nCounts Ill and IV, retaliation under the First, Fifth, and Sixth\nAmendments and the Delaware Constitution against All Defendants\nexcept May and Parker;\n\nCounts V and VI, due process violations under the Fourteenth\nAmendment and adequate process violations under the Delaware\nConstitution against all Defendants except May, Parker, and, for the Count\nV, Hollingsworth;\nCount VII, equal protection violations under the Fourteenth\nAmendment against all Defendants except May and Parker.\n\nFACTS\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nPlaintiff alleges that in September 2013, he filed a motion for modification of his\nsentence in the Delaware Superior Court. (D.I. 1 at 6). In denying the motion, the Court\nstated, \u201cthis is a case for 11 Del. C. 4217,\u201d so if the defendant (here, Plaintiff) \u201cwants a\nreduction he must use 4217.\u201d (/d.). Plaintiff's counselor at the time, Mr. Johnson (not a\ndefendant), informed Plaintiff on October 28, 2013, that he was deemed ineligible for\n4217 and recommended that Plaintiff file a motion for commutation of sentence to the\nBoard of Pardons. (/d.). During the first week of November 2013, Plaintiff spoke with\nhis former DOC Counselor Edwards, who told him she was angry with him for asking\nJohnson to submit a modification since Johnson was a new and inexperienced\ncounselor. (/d.). Edwards told Plaintiff, \u201cwe don\u2019t put in modifications for people who\nhave class (A) felonies . . . so | would suggest that you make an attempt at another\navenue.\u201d (/d.). Edwards told Plaintiff he would never get a 4217 as long as she was\nemployed at JTVCC and had anything to do with it. (/d.). She reiterated, \u201cwe don\u2019t put\nin 4217 for violent class (A) felons like you.\u201d (/d. at 7).\n\nOn March 5, 2014, Plaintiff wrote a letter to the presiding judge and explained\nthat the DOC was unwilling to submit a 4217 on his behalf because of the Class (A)\n\nfelony conviction and this illegally disqualified Plaintiff from his 4217 opportunity. (/d.).\n\nThe presiding judge had a Deputy Attorney General ask the DOC why Plaintiff was\nbeing denied a 4217 application and explain when Plaintiff would be eligible for one.\n(id.). On July 1, 2014, the Deputy Attorney General advised the Court that the DOC\nhad determined Plaintiff was \u201celigible for [4217] judicial review on January 13, 2021.\u201d\n(Id.).\n\nOn April 17, 2017, Plaintiff met with his counselor, Mrs. Hall (not a defendant),\nand requested that she make a 4217 application on his behalf. (/d.). The same day,\nHall told Plaintiff orally and by letter that he did not qualify due to his Class (A) felony\nconviction, which would not allow her to initiate the 4217 application at the next\nclassification. (/d. at 7, 8). Plaintiff had conversations with Edwards and Treatment\nAdministrator Hollis in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 and requested their assistance in\n\u201cstraightening out the misunderstanding\u201d so that he could seek judicial review. (/d. at 8).\nWhen Plaintiff spoke to Edwards and Hollis on June 9 and 10, 2019, he was told the\nDOC had disqualified him from the 4217 process \u201cbecause [Plaintiff] took court action\nagainst DOC when [Plaintiff] informed his judge that DOC had disqualified him from the\n4217 process.\u201d (/d.). They cautioned Plaintiff to \u201ctread lightly before he gets added to\ntheir \u2018institutional jerks list.\u201d (/d.).\n\nFrom January 2021 through April 2021, Plaintiff went through a succession of\ncounselors, each of whom was replaced after supervisors Hollis and Edwards were\ninformed of Plaintiffs requests to his counselor(s) to put in a sentence modification on\nhis behalf. (/d. at 7-11). Plaintiff's annual classification was held on May 13, 2021. (/d.\nat 11). He \u201cwas classified to remain in minimum status, continue work detail and to\n\ncomplete alternative to violence (AVP) group.\u201d (/d. at 11-12). When Plaintiff questioned\n4\nwhy the 4217 application was not filed on his behalf, he was told, \u201cthat madness is\nbetween you, Hollis, and Edwards so please keep me out of it.\u201d (/d. at 12).\n\nPlaintiff wrote to Warden May on May 24, 2021 and appealed the classification\nissue. (/d.). May did not respond. (/d. at 12, 13). Plaintiff saw May the first week of\nJune 2021. May told Plaintiff that he was \u201crolling in whatever direction my treatment\nteam is rolling in,\u201d and \u201cto keep up the good work and give it another try in a few years.\u201d\n(/d. at 13), Plaintiff sent a follow-up letter to May on August 3, 2021, and received no\nresponse. (/d. at 14).\n\nAbout June 22, 2021, Edwards indicated she would never support a person who\ngoes against the DOC, Plaintiff \u201cwent against the home team,\u201d and he would never get a\n4217. (/d.). At some point, Plaintiff asked why he was being discriminated and\nretaliated against for taking court action to clarify his 4217 threshold eligibility. He was\ninformed that it was \u201cexclusively between [Plaintiff] and [the] supervisors, for the reason\nof going against the DOC brass and snitching to a judge.\u201d (/d. at 11).\n\nPlaintiff wrote to Hollis on May 16, June 1, July 28, and September 6, 2021,\ncomplaining of retaliation, discrimination, due process and equal protection violations.\n(id. at 13). She did not respond. (/d.). Plaintiff wrote to Deputy Warden Parker on July\n16, 2021, complaining of retaliation and discrimination by upper management, i.e., May,\nDeputy Warden Hollingsworth, Classification Lt. Daum, and Parker, and the entire\ntreatment team, specifically Hollis and Edwards, for practicing his First Amendment right\nto grieve and petition the court for redress. (/d.). Parker did not respond to the letter.\n(/d.). Plaintiff wrote to Hollingsworth on July 27, 2021, sought her assistance with the\n\n4217, and informed her that he was retaliated and discriminated against by her\n5\n\nsubordinates because he exercised his First Amendment right to petition the court for\nredress, thereby violating his right to due process and equal protection. (/d.).\nHollingsworth did not respond to the letter. (/d.). Plaintiff wrote to Edwards on July 28,\n2021, and asked her to protect his right to equal protection and due process and to stop\nretaliating and discriminating against him by disqualifying him from the 4217 process.\n(Id. at 14).\n\nIn July 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion \u201cfor the second time in the past seven years\u201d\nwith the Delaware Superior Court seeking \u201cto have his sentence explained and clarified\u201d\nto the DOC treatment staff. (/d.). On September 29, 2021, the presiding judge ordered\ntwo Deputy Attorneys General to contact the DOC to find out why the DOC was refusing\nto file a 4217 application on Plaintiffs behalf and to inform the judge whether the\n\u201creasons included not being presently eligible due to the length of time or due to the\nnature of [Plaintiff's] sentence.\u201d (/d.).\n\nOn October 19, 2021, Plaintiff met with Counselor Sanders. Sanders informed\nPlaintiff that she would begin the paperwork for the 4217 application for sentence\nreduction, that she did not support the sentence reduction because the DOC cannot\nsupport early release for class (A) felons, and that she would present the paperwork to\nher supervisors for approval or disapproval. (/d. at 15). She submitted the 4217\napplication on October 19, 2021, which was denied by the Muiti-Disciplinary Team, but\nalso needed to be reviewed by the Institution Based Classification Committee for its\nrecommendation whether it would support Plaintiffs early release. (/d.). Plaintiff\nalleges that he had a right to attend a multi-disciplinary team hearing and present\n\nnecessary information to the board to render a fair decision, yet it was held without his\n6\n\npresence in violation of his right to due process. (/d.). The Complaint does not provide\nthe date of the hearing.\n\nOn October 20, 2021, Plaintiff received a Superior Court order that recited that\nthe DOC had stated that it mistakenly disqualified Plaintiff from the 4217 process but\nhad then made it available to Plaintiff. (/d.). Sanders informed Plaintiff that her\nsupervisors were displeased with the order and probably would not be willing to support\nthe application for early release. (/d.). Plaintiff alleges that Hollis, Edwards, Sanders,\nand Counselor Thongvong had the 4217 process done as a perfunctory formality to \u201cget\nit over and done with.\u201d (/d. at 15-16). Plaintiff wrote to Sanders and asked why he was\nbeing punished for exercising his right to grieve and petition the court and she advised\nhim to write to her supervisors with any questions and concerns moving forward. (/d. at\n16). Hollis is now Plaintiffs personal DOC counselor. (/d.).\n\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Baill v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of\n\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n7\n\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations\nomitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020. \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d /d.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Carp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\n\nasserted. See id. at 11.\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. /gba/, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSupplemental Complaint. Plaintiff filed a supplemental complaint (D.1. 13) on\nJuly 25, 2022. The supplemental complaint raises a First Amendment claim for failing\nto allow Plaintiff the right to practice his religion. The claim occurred during a timeframe\nafter the filing of the original complaint and contains facts unrelated to the claims in the\noriginal complaint. Plaintiffs remedy is to file a new case. The supplemental complaint\nwill be stricken.\n\nEleventh Amendment. The Complaint raises claims against Defendants in their\nindividual and official capacities. The Eleventh Amendment of the United States\nConstitution protects an unconsenting state or state agency from a suit brought in\nfederal court by one of its own citizens, regardless of the relief sought. See Seminole\nTribe of Fla, v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v.\n\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). \u201c[A] suit\n9\nagainst a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but\nrather is a suit against the official\u2019s office. As such, it is no different from a suit against\nthe State itself.\u201d Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) (internal\ncitations omitted). Accordingly, \u00a7 1983 claims for monetary damages against a state,\nstate agency, or a state official in his or her official capacity are barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment.\n\nJames T. Vaughn Correctional Center falls under the umbrella of the Department\nof Correction, an agency of the State of Delaware and, therefore, it is entitled to\nimmunity under the Eleventh Amendment. See, e.g., Evans v. Ford, 2004 WL 2009362,\n*4 (D. Del. Aug. 25, 2004) (dismissing claim against DOC, because DOC is state\nagency and DOC did not waive Eleventh Amendment immunity). Therefore,\nDefendants in their official capacities have immunity from monetary damages under the\nEleventh Amendment.\n\nFinally, the Complaint appears to seek both retrospective and prospective\ninjunctive relief. The Eleventh Amendment permits suits for prospective injunctive relief\nagainst state officials acting in violation of federal law. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.\n123 (1908). \u201cThis standard allows courts to order prospective relief, as weil as\nmeasures ancillary to appropriate prospective relief.\u201d Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431,\n437 (2004) (internal citations omitted). The official capacity claims are dismissed to the\nextent that Plaintiff seeks retrospective injunctive relief from Defendants in their official\ncapacities.\n\nAs discussed, the State of Delaware has neither consented to Plaintiff's suit nor\n\nwaived its immunity. Therefore, the official capacity claims against State Defendants\n10\nwill be dismissed to the extent that Plaintiff seeks monetary damages and retrospective\ninjunctive relief.\n\nPersonal Involvement/Respondeat Superior. In reading the Complaint,\nPlaintiff appears to raise claims against May, Parker, and Hollingsworth based upon\ntheir supervisory positions. It is well-established that there is no respondeat superior\nliability under \u00a7 1983. See Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016). As\ncurrently pled, the Complaint fails to state claims against these supervisory officials, and\nthey will be dismissed. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend to cure the pleading\ndeficiencies against the foregoing Defendants.\n\nCounts | and Il, Right to Petition, Right of Access to the Courts, and Due\nProcess. Plaintiff alleges that the adverse actions of May, Parker, Hollingsworth, Hollis,\nEdwards, Daum, Thongvong, and Sanders caused him \u201cto suffer injury that chilled him/\na person of ordinary firmness, from continuing to engage in [First] Amendment\nprotected activity.\u201d (D.1. 1 at 26-27). In a First Amendment right of access to the courts\nclaim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant\u2019s actions chilled the exercise of this\nright; in cases alleging retaliation, a plaintiff need not allege that defendant\u2019s conduct\nhad a chilling effect. See Anderson v. Davila, 125 F.3d 148, 163 n.15 (3d Cir. 1997).\nThe Complaint\u2019s allegations do not support the First Amendment claim. He does not\ndescribe any chilling. To the contrary, Plaintiff has pursued, and continues to pursue,\nrelief by submitting grievances and by seeking assistance from State and Federal\nCourts. Counts | and II will be dismissed for failure to state claims upon which relief can\n\nbe granted. Amendment is futile as to Counts | and Il.\n\n11\nCounts Ill and IV, Retaliation. Plaintiff raises retaliation claims against\nHollingsworth, Hollis, Edwards, Daum, Thongvong, and Sanders. In doing so, he refers\nto the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments.\n\nIt is a \u201cfundamental principle of constitutional adjudication\u201d that \u201c[t]he limitations\nof the Fifth Amendment restrict only federal government action.\u201d The Fifth Amendment\nDue Process Clause applies to federal officials. See Hail v. Nisbit, 2022 WL 910339, at\n*2 (3d Cir. Mar. 29, 2022) (citing Bingue v. Prunchak, 512 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.\n2008)). No Defendant is a federal official. Because the Fifth Amendment is\ninapplicable to state actors, and Plaintiff brings claims against state officials only, the\nFifth Amendment claims necessarily fail and will be dismissed.\n\nSimilarly, the claims under the Sixth Amendment are not cognizable. The Sixth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution applies only in the criminal setting and is\nnot applicable to the instant action. See Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 690 (1972)\n(holding that the Sixth Amendment guarantees only apply to \u201ccriminal prosecutions\u2019).\nTherefore, it will be dismissed.\n\nThe Court turns to the retaliation claims that arise under the First Amendment. A\nprisoner alleging retaliation must show: \u201c(1) his conduct was constitutionaily protected;\n(2) he suffered an adverse action at the hands of prison officials; and (3) his\nconstitutionally protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor\u2019 in the officials\u2019\ndecisions. Watson v. Rozum, 834 F.3d 417, 422 (3d Cir. 2016) (citing Rauser v. Horn,\n\n241 F.3d 330, 333-34 (3d Cir. 2001)).\n\n12\nHaving reviewed the Complaint, | find that it adequately? alleges retaliation\nclaims against Hollis and Edwards. It does not however, allege sufficient facts to state\nretaliation claims against Hollingsworth, Daum, Thongvong, and Sanders. The\nretaliation claims against Hollingsworth, Daum, Thongvong, and Sanders will be\ndismissed. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend the retaliation claims.\n\nCounts V and VI, Procedural Due Process. The Complaint alleges Hollis,\nEdwards, Daum, Thongvong, and Sanders violated Plaintiff's procedural due process\nwhen Plaintiff was denied procedural due process in disqualifying him from the 4217\nprocess. | take this to refer to the allegation that Plaintiff was not allowed to attend the\nMulti-Disciplinary Team hearing that disqualified him from the 4217 process. The\nhearing was held by Hollis, Edwards, and unspecified members of the treatment team.\nThe 4217 hearing is similar to a parole hearing. It is well-established that that \u201conce a\nstate institutes a parole system, all prisoners have a liberty interest flowing directly from\nthe due process clause in not being denied parole for arbitrary or constitutionally\nimpermissible reasons.\u201d See Block v. Potter, 631 F.2d 233, 236 (3d Cir. 1980). Hence,\n\nPlaintiff has a substantive due process right in being treated fairly during the parole\n\n? A constant refrain in the Complaint is that DOC would not file a \u00a7 4217 application for\nsomeone with a class A felony conviction. Plaintiff was such a person. Even assuming,\nas | do at screening, that Delaware law contains nothing making that a requirement,\nDOC\u2019s practice not to do so would not by itself be a federal constitutional violation.\nOverall, the Complaint only alleges retaliation as one of multiple reasons for DOC\u2019s\ndecision not to file a \u00a7 4217 application on Plaintiff's behalf. | think that is sufficient at\nthis time. | also note that most of the retaliation is alleged to be for something that\nhappened in 2014, and it appears to be the case that Plaintiff was statutorily ineligible to\nfile a \u00a7 4217 application before January 2021. Seven years is a long time to hold a\ngrudge. But the pleading standard is to assume the allegations are \u201ctrue (even if\ndoubtful in fact).\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\n13\n\nprocess. See Jubilee v. Horn, 975 F.Supp. 761, 764-65 (E .D. Pa. 1997), affd,151 F.3d\n1025 (3d Cir. 1998). In addition, it appears that Plaintiff had a procedural due process\nright to present his case. See Patten v. North Dakota Parole Bd., 783 F.2d 140, 143\n(8th Cir.1986) (concluding that even though \u201cno process was due\u201d because the state\n\u201cha[d] not created a protected liberty interest in parole,\u201d inmates received \u201cample\nopportunity\u201d to present their cases to the parole board). As pled, Counts V and VI\nadequately allege procedural due process claims against Hollis and Edwards, but not\nDaum, Thongvong, and Sanders. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend the procedural\ndue process claim.\n\nThe Count also alleges due process violations by reason of the Defendants\u2019\nfailure to follow and/or abide by Bureau of Prisons Policy 3.32. \u201cTo establish liability\nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that the defendants, acting under color of\nlaw, violated the plaintiffs federal constitutional or statutory rights, and thereby caused\nthe complained of injury.\u201d Elmore v. Cleary, 399 F.3d 279, 281 (3d Cir. 2005). \u201c[Section]\n1983 merely provides a mechanism for enforcing individual rights \u2018secured\u2019 elsewhere,\ni.e., rights independently \u2018secured by the Constitution and laws\u2019 of the United States.\u201d\nGonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285 (2002). Federal and state regulations such as\nBOP policies do not give rise to a liberty interest. See Rambert v. Beard, 2012 WL\n760619, at *13 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 7, 2012) (compiling cases). The due process claims\nbased upon violation of BOP Policy 3.32 fail as a matter of law and will be dismissed.\n\nCount VII, Equal Protection. Plaintiff alleges Hollingsworth, Hollis, Edwards,\nDaum, Thongvong, and Sanders violated his right to equal protection because he \u201chas\n\nbeen and continues to be treated differently than similarly situated inmates ... because\n14\n\nhe has a class (A) felony conviction, and because he practiced his First Amendment\nright to grieve and petition the court for redress.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 31).\n\nPlaintiff alleges that he is similarly situated to Nikerray Middlebrook, Brandon\nKasinath, Corey Barber, and Shaun Carpenter, for all of whom DOC supported 4217\napplications in 2020. (D.I. 1 at 32). But he does not allege that each of them was\nconvicted of a class A felony, and he does not allege that each of them did not exercise\nhis First Amendment rights.\n\nA plaintiff may bring an equal protection claim under two legal theories: (1) by\nalleging a defendant treated him differently from other similarly situated individuals\nbecause of his membership in an identifiable or protected class, such as race, religion,\nsex, or national origin,4 Mack v. Warden Loretto FC/, 839 F.3d 286, 305 n.112 (3d Cir.\n2016); or (2) in a \u201cclass of one,\u201d by alleging a defendant treated him differently from\nothers similarly situated for arbitrary or irrational reasons, Village of Willowbrook v.\nOlech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000); Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d at 243.\n\u201cPersons are similarly situated under the Equal Protection Clause when they are alike\n\u2018in all relevant aspects.\u201d Startzell v. City of Philadelphia, Pa., 533 F.3d 183, 203 (3d\n\nCir. 2008) (quoting Norlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992)).\n\n3 Under Delaware law, a class A felony requires a minimum sentence of fifteen years\nimprisonment. 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4205(b)(1). Kasinath\u2019s \u00a7 4217 application was filed and\ngranted, but Kasinath was not convicted of a class A felony. State v. Kasinath, 2020\nWL 4219422 (Del. Super. Ct. July 23, 2020).\n4 The Complaint repeatedly refers to discrimination and equal protection. Nowhere are\nthere allegations that support a discrimination claim. Plaintiffs allegations more aptly\ndescribe an equal protection claim.\n\n15\nThe Complaint does not contain any factual allegations that would make him a\nmember of a protected class different from that of Middlebrook, Kasinath, Barber, and\nCarpenter. Nor does it allege that he was treated differently from other inmates without\nany rational basis. The equal protection claims will be dismissed. Plaintiff will be given\nleave to amend the equal protection claims.\n\nRequest for Counsel. Plaintiff requests counsel on the grounds that he does not\nhave the ability to present his case, he is unskilled in the law, the issues are complex\nand beyond his ability to pursue an effective investigation, the case may turn on\ncredibility determinations, testimony of expert witnesses will be necessary, he cannot\nobtain and afford counsel on his own behalf, appointment of counsel would serve \u201cthe\nbest interest of justice\u201d, and, his allegations, if proven, would establish constitutional\nviolations. (D.1. 3). A pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional\nor statutory right to representation by counsel.5 See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d\n187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993). However,\nrepresentation by counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a\nfinding that a plaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.\n\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of\nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in\n\n1\n\ndeciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the\n\n5See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of lowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989)\n(\u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7 1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling\nattorney to represent an indigent civil litigant, the operative word in the statute being\n\u201crequest.\u201d).\n\n16\nmerits of the plaintiffs claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her case\nconsidering his or her education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon\nhim or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to\nwhich factual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue such\ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiff's capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and\n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony.\nSee Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at\n155-56. The list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative. Tabron, 6 F.3d\nat 157.\n\nAt this juncture, it is far from clear that Plaintiff's claims have merit. Most of the\nclaims will be dismissed, and Plaintiff will be given leave to amend. Therefore, the\nrequest for counsel will be denied without prejudice to renew.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny without prejudice to renew\nPlaintiff's request for counsel (D.1. 3); (2) strike the supplemental complaint (D.I. 13); (3)\nallow Plaintiff to proceed with the retaliation and due process claims against Hollis and\nEdwards; (4) dismiss all other claims; and (5) give Plaintiff leave to amend the claims\nraised against May, Parker, and Hollingworth based upon their supervisory positions;\nthe retaliation claims against Hollingsworth, Daum, Thongvong, and Sanders; the\nprocedural due process claims against Daum, Thongvong, and Sanders; and the equal\nprotection claims against all Defendants.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n17\n\n"}
