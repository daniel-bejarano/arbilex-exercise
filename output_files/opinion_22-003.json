No. 22-03- JLH \n      \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \nPlaintiff Victoria Laverne Mosley appeals from an unfavorable decision of the \nCommissioner of the Social Security Administration denying her application for disability \ninsurance benefits and supplemental security income.  This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).  The parties consented to the entry of final judgment by the United States Magistrate \nJudge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).  (D.I. 11, 12.)   \nThe parties filed cross- motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 16, 22.)  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench on November 15, 2022, the Court DENIES  Plaintiff\u2019 s motion and \nGRANT S the Commissioner\u2019 s cross -motion. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissioner \u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence. \u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidenc e \u201cmeans \u2014and means only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d   Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n1154 (2019) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).  In reviewing \nwheth er substantial evidence supports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts may not \u201c re-weigh the 2 \n evidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d   Chandler v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d \n356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011); see also  Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014).  In other \nwords, reviewing courts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner\u2019 s decision, even if they would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissio ner follows a five -step sequential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u2009404.1520(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v);  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third \nCircuit has previously explained this sequential analysis, and the shifting burdens that attend each step, in detail:  \nThe first two steps involve threshold determinations.  In step \none, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.  If a claimant is found to be engaging in substantial gainful activity, the disabili ty \nclaim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.  If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the disability cl aim is \ndenied.  In step three, the Commissioner compares the medical \nevidence of the claimant \u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.  If the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his \npast relevant work.  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former oc cupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final step.  At this stage, the burden of production shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner  must show there are \nother jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of 3 \n all the claimant\u2019 s impairments in determining whether he is capable \nof performing work and is not disabled. \n \nNewell v. Comm\u2019 r of Soc. Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 545\u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is id entical whether an application seeks disability insurance benefits or supplemental \nsecurity income.  McCrea v. Comm\u2019 r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nMy decision  was announced from the bench on November 15, 2022, as follows:  \nPlaintiff\u2019 s motion for summary judgment is denied and the \nCommissioner\u2019 s cross -motion for summary judgment will be \ngranted.  As I write for the parties, who know the record and legal \nframework , I will summarize the reasons for my decision.  \n \nPlaintiff says that the ALJ erred in various ways, but  the \nthrust of her argument to this Court is that the ALJ \u2019s residual \nfunctiona l capacity ( \u201cRFC \u201d) finding was erroneous because he \nimproperly discounted the opinions of two of Plaintiff \u2019s treating \ndoctors, Dr. Bruce Grossinger and Dr. Sehba Husain- Kruautter.   \n \nThe Court has carefully reviewed the record.  Having done \nso, the Court understands and has considered Plaintiff \u2019s argument \nthat, in ass essing Plaintiff\u2019 s RFC, the ALJ should have given more \nweight to the opinions of Plaintiff \u2019s treating physicians.  But it is \nnot the role of this Court to second -guess the ALJ\u2019 s fact finding.  \nEven if this Court might have come to a different conclusion on  \nthe same evidence, there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Plaintiff \u2019s RFC.  So the Court is \ncompelled to grant the Commissioner \u2019s motion.  \n I\u2019ll start with Plaintiff \u2019s arguments that the ALJ \nimproperly discounted the opinion of Plaintiff \u2019s pain management \nspecialist, Dr. Grossinger.  Plaintiff had been seeing Dr. Grossinger since 2013.  In office notes dated January and February 2019, Dr. Grossinger recorded his impressions that Plaintiff had \u201cevidence of cervical radiculopat hy, cervical facet syndrome, and \nEMG-proven brachial plexopathy\u201d  and that she also had \u201c lumbar \nfacet syndrome, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and lumbar radiculopathy.\u201d\n0F1   \n \n \n1 (Transcript of Social Security Proceedings, D.I. 1 4 (\u201cRecord \u201d or \u201cR.\u201d) at 1886\u201388.)  4 \n In May 2019, Dr. Grossinger provided a medical source \nstatement. 1F2  He opined that Plaintiff was very limited in her ability \nto work.  For example, he opined that she can only sit for less than \n2 hours a day, stand/walk for less than 2 hours a day, only occasionally lift 10 pounds, and is significantly limited with respect to reaching, handling, or fingering.  He also explained that her \u201cpain can be severe and interfere with her activities of daily \nliving. \u201d\n2F3   \n In August 2019, Plaintiff was involved in a car accident \nthat she reported to have exacerbated her back pain.  In a treatment note from March 2020, Dr. Grossinger concluded that Plaintiff \u201ccontinue[d] to suffer from cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, \ncervi cal and facet lumbar syndrome, as well as sacroiliac \ndysfunction, \u201d which he at that point stated were \u201c all referable to \nthe motor vehicle accident of 8/30/2019,\u201d  notwithstanding that Dr. \nGrossinger \u2019s own notes reflect that Plaintiff suffered from all of \nthose issues prior to the accident.\n3F4   \n In a letter to Plaintiff \u2019s attorney dated November 4, 2020, \nDr. Grossinger stated that his opinion as to Plaintiff\u2019 s work -related \nabilities was the same as set forth in his May 2019 statement.\n4F5   \n In March 2018, Plaintiff underwent a consultative \nexamination by Dr. Josette Covington.  Dr. Covington opined that \nPlaintiff was \u201c physically capable of lifting, bending and twisting, \nwalking and standing as needed for work.\u201d\n5F6 \n \nAfter summarizing that and o ther evidence of record, the \nALJ concluded that physical limitations on Plaintiff \u2019s ability to \nperform work activities were \u201c warranted \u201d; however, the ALJ \ndeclined to impose the extreme limitations set forth in Dr. Grossinger \u2019s opinion.\n6F7  The ALJ explained that Dr. Grossinger \u2019s \nreport was \u201cnot persuasive \u201d because the \u201c physical examination \nfindings . . . do not support the extreme limitations in the \n \n2 (R. 1446\u201348.)   \n \n3 (R. 1448.)   \n \n4 (R. 2770\u201371.)  \n \n5 (R. 2802.)  \n \n6 (R. 1035.)  \n \n7 (R. 33\u201334.)  5 \n claimant \u2019s physical abilities . . . . The limitations indicated are also \ninconsistent with th e consultative examination report and the \nclaimant \u2019s testimony in February that she only sometimes drops \nthings and that her mobility is good. \u201d 7F8   \n \nPlaintiff suggests that the ALJ did not correctly apply the \nregulatory framework for evaluating opinion evi dence.  Plaintiff \naccurately points out that the ALJ was required to discuss the supportability and consistency factors.\n8F9  But the ALJ did just that \nin his lengthy and thorough opinion. 9F10  \n \nPlaintiff says that the ALJ erred by not taking into account \nthe fact that Plaintiff was a long -time patient of Dr. Grossinger\u2019 s.  \nBut because the ALJ wasn \u2019t required to discuss in his opinion any \nfactors beyond supportability and consistency, 10F11 he did not need \nto provide analysis about Dr. Grossinger \u2019s long relationshi p with \nPlaintiff in his written opinion.   Nonetheless, in the summary of \nthe medical evidence, the ALJ discussed Dr. Grossinger \u2019s \ntreatment notes going back to 2013, suggesting that the ALJ did \nconsider Dr. Grossinger \u2019s lengthy treatment of Plaintiff. 11F12 \n \nPlaintiff contends that Dr. Grossinger \u2019s report is consistent \nand supported by his treatment records.  At bottom, Plaintiff seems \nto be asking me to reweigh the evidence to say that the ALJ should \nhave come out a different way.  But I cannot do that. 12F13  My review \nhere is limited to whether the ALJ\u2019 s determination that Dr. \nGrossinger \u2019s report was inconsistent with other evidence in the \nrecord is supported by substantial evidence.  After reviewing the \nrecord, I find that there is substantial evidence supporti ng the \nALJ\u2019s decision to discount the extreme limitations set forth in Dr. \nGrossinger \u2019s report.  In the ALJ \u2019s thorough, six- and-a-half page \n \n8 (R. 34.)  \n \n9 See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2) , 416.920c(b)(2).  \n \n10 (R. 34 (finding that Dr. Grossinger \u2019s opinion was not \u201c support[ed] \u201d by other physical \nexamination findings and was \u201c inconsistent with the consultative examination report . . .  and \n[Plaintiff\u2019 s] testimony \u201d).) \n \n11 See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2) \u2013(3), 416.920c(b)(2) \u2013(3).  \n \n12 (R. 30.)  \n \n13 Chandler , 667 F.3d at  359 ( \u201cCourts are not permitted to re -weigh the evidence or impose \ntheir own factual determinations. \u201d). 6 \n discussion of Plaintiff \u2019s medical history, the ALJ discusses \nmedical evidence in the record that does not support the extreme \nlimitations endorsed by Dr. Grossinger.  The ALJ also explains that Dr. Grossinger \u2019s proposed limitations are inconsistent with \nPlaintiff\u2019 s testimony and the consultative examination.  That \nexplanation was sufficient.  \n Plaintiff\u2019 s reply brief argues (for the first time) that the \nALJ didn\u2019 t just weigh the medical evidence incorrectly, he \nactually rejected Dr. Grossinger \u2019s report for a reason that is \ndirectly refuted by the evidence.\n13F14 Plaintiff points to the ALJ \u2019s \nstatement that Plaintiff\u2019 s \u201cMRIs have shown only mild lumbar \ndegenerative disc disease, \u201d 14F15 which Plaintiff suggests is \nconclusively refuted by Dr. Andrew Freese \u2019s September 2020 \nconclusion that there is \u201c clear evidence of significant disk \nabnormalities. \u201d 15F16  \n  \nThe ALJ \u2019s characterization of  Plaintiff \u2019s disc disease does \nnot constitute reversible error.  For one thing, it \u2019s not clear to me \nthat a finding of \u201c significant disk abnormalities \u201d on an MRI is \ninconsistent with a finding of mild lumbar degenerative disc disease.  Moreover, this is no t a case of the ALJ overlooking \npertinent, relevant, or probative evidence ,\n16F17 as the ALJ \nspecifically included the findings of that MRI earlier in his \nopinion. 17F18  That suggests that he knew of it and considered it.  \n    \nFinally, I reject Plaintiff \u2019s argument that the ALJ erred by \nrelying on Dr. Covington\u2019 s consultative examination because it \nwas stale.  The age of the report is not itself a problem, as the Third \nCircuit has held that it is not error in and of itself for an ALJ to \nrely on medical opinions that are several years old. 18F19  Moreover, \nas recited earlier, the ALJ did consider medical evidence that post -\n \n14 (D.I. 24 at 2.)  \n \n15 (Id. (quoting R. 33).)  \n \n16 (Id. (quoting R. 2804).)  \n \n17 Johnson v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 529 F.3d 198, 204 (3d Cir. 2008) ( \u201c[A]n ALJ may not \nreject pertinent or probative evidence without explanation. \u201d). \n \n18 (R. 31.)  \n \n19 Chandler , 667 F.3d at  361. \n 7 \n dated Plaintiff \u2019s 2019 accident and nevertheless found that the \nextreme limitations put forth by Dr. Grossinger \u2014which were the \nsame both before and after the accident \u2014were not supported by \nthe evidence.    \n \nI\u2019ll now turn to Plaintiff\u2019 s arguments about the opinions of \nher treating psychiatrist, Dr. Husain- Krau tter.  \n On May 8, 2019, Dr. Husain- Krautter completed a medical \nopinion regarding Plaintiff \u2019s work abilities. She opined that \nPlaintiff was very limited in her ability to work as a result of her mental illnesses. For example, she opined that Plaintiff was \u201cunable to meet competitive standards \u201d in a variety of areas, \nincluding maintaining attentio n for 2 hour segments, handling \nwork stress, and others.  She explained that all of Plaintiff\u2019 s mental \nillnesses \u201ccause her to be less productive and unable to function \neffectively. \u201d\n19F20  In a November 1, 2020 letter to Plaintiff \u2019s \nattorney, Dr. Husain- Kraut ter indicated that her opinion with \nregard to Plaintiff \u2019s functional capacities remained the same. 20F21 \n \nAfter reviewing that and other evidence of record, the ALJ \nconcluded that limiting Plaintiff \u201c to unskilled reasoning level 1 \nand 2 jobs with occasional social interaction [was] reasonable \u201d but \nthat \u201c[t]he record does not support additional physical or mental \nlimitations. \u201d 21F22 \n In rejecting the extreme limitations proposed by Dr. \nHusain -Krautter, the ALJ found that they were \u201c not persuasive, as \nmental status examination findings throughout the record do not \nshow that the claimant is as limited. \u201d\n22F23  The ALJ also found \npersuasive a 2017 consultative examination report authored by Dr. Ramnik Singh, who found that Plaintiff was only moderately \nlimited by he r mental illnesses.  \n  \nSubstantial evidence supports the ALJ \u2019s decision not to \nadopt the most restrictive limitations proposed in Dr. Husain -\nKrautter\u2019 s report.  The ALJ set forth a thorough summary of \nPlaintiff\u2019 s mental health history, included limitations  in the RFC \n \n20 (R. 1357\u201358.)  \n \n21 (R. at 2796.)  \n \n22 (R. 33.)  \n \n23 (R. 35.)  8 to account for her mental impairments, and provided a lengthy \nexplanation of why other limitations endorsed by Dr. Husain-Krautter were not supported by the record.   \nPla\nintiff contends that the ALJ erred in concluding that the \ntreatment record \u201c did not document significant  . . . symptoms, \u201d \nand Plaintiff points to the fact that she had been diagnosed with dissociative disorder.\n23F24  But Plaintiff fails to identify any evidence \nof her dissociative disorder causing any interference in her activitie s.  \nPla\nintiff also alleges that the ALJ committed legal error by \nrelying exclusively on mental status examinations to discount Dr. Husain -Krautter\u2019 s opinion.  But that argument relies on a faulty \npremise, as the ALJ\u2019 s opinion demonstrates that he considered the \nrecord as a whole, not just the mental status examinations.   \nPla\nintiff\u2019 s argument again comes down to her assertion \nthat the ALJ should have given more weight to Dr. Husain-Krautter\u2019 s opinions.  But it is not this Court\u2019 s role to weigh the \nevidence.  \nThe\n ALJ appropriately considered the treating physicians \u2019 \nopinions, and the ALJ \u2019s RFC determination is supported by \nsubstantial evidence.   I have considered the remainder of \nPlaintiff\u2019 s arguments and have determined that they do not warrant \nfurther discussion in light of the conclusions already stated. \nIII. CONCL\nUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff \u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 16) is\nDENIED and the Commissioner \u2019s cross- motion (D.I. 22) is  GRANTED.   The Clerk of Court is \ndirected to close the case.  \nDat\ned: December  21, 2022 ____________________________ _____ __ \nThe Honorable Jennifer L.
