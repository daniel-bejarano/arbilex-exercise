(D.I. 8). For the following reasons, \ndefendant's motion is DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nTaKaDu Ltd. sued Innovyze, Inc. for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,920,983 (\"the \n'983 Patent\"), 8,341,106 (\"the '106 Patent\"), 9,053,519 (\"the'519 Patent\"), and 9,568,392 (\"the \n'392 Patent\"). (D.I. 1). The patents \"relat[e] to methods and systems for monitoring a water \nutility network.\" (Id. ,r 1). Innovyze argues that the patents claim patent ineligible subject \nmatter under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. (D.I. 9). \nstates: The '983 and '392 patents share a common specification. Claim 1 of the '983 patent \nA computerized method for monitoring a water utility network, the water utility network \ncomprising at least a network of pipes for delivering water to consumers and a plurality \nof meters positioned within the water utility network, the method comprising: \nreceiving meter data, the meter data representing a plurality of parameters \nmeasured by the meters, the parameters including at least flow or pressure of the \nwater through the pipes; \nreceiving secondary data from one or more sources external to the meters, the \nsecondary data representing one or more conditions affecting flow or \nconsumption of water in a region serviced by the water utility network; \nanalyzing the meter data by statistically predicting meter data for a first meter \nbased on second meter data from the water utility network and secondary data, \nwherein the second meter data comprises meter data other than the received first \nmeter data, and comparing the received first meter data with the predicted meter \ndata for the fust meter to identify one or more water utility network events \ncomprising at least one or more leakage events by detecting an anomaly if the \nreceived first meter data deviates from the predicted meter data for the first meter \nby a statistical deviation; and \nreporting the one or more water network events to a user via a user interface. \nClaim 1 of the '392 patent states: \n2 A computerized method for analyzing resource distribution throughout a network, the \nmethod comprising: \nreceiving meter data, the meter data representing a plurality of parameters \nmeasured by a plurality of meters positioned within a resource distribution \nnetwork; \nreceiving secondary data from one or more sources external to the meters, the \nsecondary data representing one or more conditions affecting a condition of \nnetwork assets in a region serviced by the resource distribution network; \nstatistically predicting meter data for at least one meter based on secondary data; \ncomparing the received meter data with the likely distribution of predicted values \nto detect one or more anomalies if the received meter data deviates from the likely \ndistribution of predicted values; \nidentifying a resource distribution network event on the basis of the detected \nanomalies wherein identifying the resource distribution network event comprises \nidentifying a faulty meter event by: \nreceiving a first data set representative of a first meter to be analyzed, \nreceiving a reference data set representati ve of a physicall y separate \nsecond meter, \ncorrelating the first data set with the reference data set, \ndetermining a time shift based on the correlation of the first data set with \nthe reference data set, and \nissuing a faulty meter event based on a statistical significance of the time \nshift; and \nreporting the resource distribution network event. \nThe '519 is titled \"System and Method for Analyzing GIS Data to Improve Operation and \nMonitoring of Water Distribution Networks. \" Claim 1 recites: \nA computer-implemented method for modeling a utility network, the method comprising : \nretrieving geographical information system (GIS) data and asset management data \nof one or more assets of the utility network, wherein the GIS data and asset \nmanagement data do not indicate connections between the one or more assets and \nwherein the GIS data includes coordinate data associated with the one or more \nassets; \ngenerating , via a processing device, one or more mathematical graph elements \nfrom the one or more assets; \n3 creating, via the processing device, probable connections between the one or more \nmathematical graph elements based on the GIS and asset management data, \nwherein creating probable connections comprises snapping a plurality of junctions \nbased on coordinate data; \ngenerating , via the processing device, a mathematical graph based on the probable \nconnections , the mathematical graph including one or more asset characteristics \nof the one or more assets; \nanalyzing , via the processing device, the determined junctions , wherein analyzing \ncomprises determining if an analyzed junction appears between only two other \njunctions and merging the two other junctions if the analyzed junction appears \nbetween only two other junctions; \nidentifying, via the processing device and by analyzing the mathematical graph, \none or more flow monitoring zones (FMZs) in the utility network, wherein \nidentifying one or more FMZs is based upon analyzing junction locations; and \nstoring the mathematical graph data for use by one or more systems. \nThe '106 patent is titled \"System and Method for Identifying Related Events in a \nResource Network Monitoring System.\" Claim 1 states: \nA computerized method performed using a processor for identifying related events in a \nwater network monitoring system, the events represented by stored event data derived \nfrom data received from one or more sources including sensor data received from a \nplurality of sensors in the water network, each event data comprising data identifying an \nevent and one or more characteristics of the event, the method comprising: \nretrieving event data from an event database, the event data representing a \nplurality of events which have been processed from anomalies received from the \nwater network monitoring system and which each contain a plurality of data fields \nincluding event start time and event magnitude ; \nidentifying at least two events from the event data as being candidate events that \nare likely to constitute parts of a composite event, the identified candidate events \neach being determined by the water network monitoring system not to be \nstatistically significant enough to be reported as events by themselves; \nselecting an event combination rule, the event combination rule including one or \nmore tests to determine whether the candidate events are related and can be \ncombined to form a composite event of a given event type; \ncomparing one or more event characteristics between the at least two candidate \nevents based on the event combination rule; \ndetermining , based at least in part on the comparison , that at least two candidate \nevents are related to one another and are processible as a single event of the given \nevent type; and \n4 reporting the determination of the at least two candidate events as being related \nand as the single event of the given event type to a user via a user interface. \nInnovyze argues that claim 1 of each patent is representative. (D.I. 9 at 2-5). TaK.aDu \ndisagrees. (D.I. 13 at 7). Because I agree with TaKaDu that the claims are directed to patent \neligible subject matter, I will focus my analysis on the claims Innovyze believes are \nrepresentative. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nPatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is a threshold legal issue. Bilski v. Kappas, 561 U.S. \n593, 602 (2010). Accordingly , the \u00a7 101 inquiry is properly raised at the pleading stage if it is \napparent from the face of the patent that the asserted claims are not directed to eligible subject \nmatter. See Cleveland Clinic Found. v. True Health Diagnostics LLC, 859 F.3d 1352, 1360 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 2621 (2018). The inquiry is appropriate at this stage \n\"only when there are no factual allegations that, taken as true, prevent resolving the eligibility \nquestion as a matter oflaw.\" Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d \n1121, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nSection 101 of the Patent Act provides: \"Whoever invents or discovers any new and \nuseful process, machine, manufacture , or composition of matter, or any new and useful \nimprovement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of \nthis title.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Supreme Court recognizes three categories of ineligible subject \nmatter-laws of nature, natural phenomena , and abstract ideas. Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank \nInt'!, 573 U.S. 208,216 (2014). The purpose of these exceptions is to protect the \"basic tools of \nscientific and technological work.\" Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab ys, Inc., 566 \nU.S. 66, 71 (2012). \n5 In Alice, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the framework laid out in Mayo \"for \ndistinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from \nthose that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts.\" 573 U.S. at 217. First, the court \nmust determine whether the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible concept. Id. If the answer is \nyes, the court must look to \"the elements of the claim both individually and as an ordered \ncombination\" to see if there is an \"inventive concept-i.e. , an element or combination of \nelements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than \na patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\" Id. at 217-18 (cleaned up). \"A claim that recites an \nabstract idea must include additional features to ensure that the claim is more than a drafting \neffort designed to monopolize the abstract idea.\" Id. at 221 (cleaned up). Further, \"the \nprohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use \nof [the idea] to a particular technological environment.\" Id. at 222 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Bilski, 561 U.S. at 610-11). Thus, \"the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot \ntransform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\" Id. at 223. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nAt Alice step one, Innovyze argues that the claims are directed to the abstract idea of \n\"collecting information, analyzing it, and displaying (or storing) the results.\" (D.I. 9 at 1). This \nis an oversimplification. Claim 1 of the '983 patent, for example, recites a way to identify water \nleakage events. The method does so by comparing data received from a water meter with \nstatistically predicted values. If the received data differs from the statistically predicted values \nby a statistical deviation, then it is considered an anomaly and a leakage event is logged. The \n'392 patent is similar. Claim 1 of the '392 patent mirrors claim 1 of the '983 patent but adds \nsteps for determining when there is a faulty meter event. Innovyze's formulation that the claim \n6 is directed to \"collecting information , analyzing it, and displaying the results\" neglects the most \nimportant part of these claims--detecting water leakage or similar events. Thus, I find \nTaKaDu's argument that the claims of the '983 and '392 patents are \"directed to improved \nmonitoring methods of water utility networks and resource distribution of said networks \" more \npersuasive. \nThe other patents are similarly directed to improved methods of monitoring utility \nnetworks. The claims of the '106 patent are directed to an improved method of identifying two \nor more anomalies or events as related. As the specification explains, \"Monitoring systems often \nreport on many different events at once .... Some of these events, though reported separately , \nmay actually be caused by or otherwise related to the same real-world events, though such \ninformation is not provided by or clear from the event data being reported.\" '106 Patent, 1 :43-\n49. The specification provides the example of a breached valve, which \"typically manifests itself \nas a simultaneous flow increase in one and corresponding flow decrease in the other, both of \nwhich would be detected and reported as events, though as separate events.\" '106 Patent, 1:57-\n60. \"Moreover , for a sufficiently small event , individual component anomalies may be \nstatistically insignificant , if viewed separately , but stand out if correctly considered together.\" \n1 :61-63. Claim 1, for instance, identifies two or more events that are \"not statistically \nsignificant enough to be reported as events by themselves. \" As TaKaDu explains, \"By \ncombining event data, one may be able to detect a significant anomaly that was untraceable \npreviously. \" (D.I. 13 at 14). \nThe claims of the '519 patent are \"directed to methods and systems for analyzing and \nusing geographical information system (GIS) data, asset management data, and sen[s]or archive \ndata of one or more assets to improve resource network operation and monitoring. \" (D.I. 13 at \n7 9). The '519 patent analyzes GIS data to gain insight into the performance of a utility network. \nCl. 1. The specification explains that prior art systems made limited use of GIS data: \"Often \ntimes, GIS data is merely displayed and not used for automated analysis and functions. \" '519 \nPatent, 2:35-37. In contrast, the claimed methods and systems incorporate GIS data into an \nanalysis that reports useful information such as warnings , suggested maintenance , and optimal \nmeter locations. See '519 Patent, 3: 10-49. In the process, the GIS data is \"enriched\" by a \n\"structural analysis system.\" \"The structural analysis system links or integrates information that \nis difficult to associate through any other means, and analyses this information to improve the \nquality of GIS data and gain new insight into network structure, not readily available through any \nother means.\" '519 Patent, 6:7-10. \nIn its arguments that the asserted claims are directed to abstract ideas, Innovyze relies \nheavily on Electric Power Group, LLC v. Alstom S.A., 830 F.3d 1350, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \n(See D.I. 9 at 8-20). The representative claim in Electric Power Group recited \"A method of \ndetecting events on an interconnected electric power grid in real time over a wide area and \nautomatically analyzing the events on the interconnected electric power grid .... \" Id. at 1351. \nThe method involved gathering data from various sources, \"detecting and analyzing events in \nreal-time ,\" and displaying the results. Id. at 1352. \nThe similarities between the Electric Power Group patent and TaKaDu's patents are \nsuperficial. Both involve gathering and analyzing data for utility networks. The Electric Power \nGroup claims, however, \"do not go beyond requiring the collection , analysis, and display of \navailable information in a particular field, stating those functions in general terms, without \nlimiting them to technical means for performing the functions that are arguably an advance over \n8 conventional computer and network technology. \" Id. at 13 51. The analysis step, for instance, \nrecited: \ndetecting and analyzing events in real-time from the plurality of data streams from the \nwide area based on at least one of limits, sensitivities and rates of change for one or more \nmeasurements from the data streams and dynamic stability metrics derived from analysis \nof the measurements from the data streams including at least one of frequency instability , \nvoltages, power flows, phase angles, damping, and oscillation modes, derived from the \nphasor measurements and the other power system data sources in which the metrics are \nindicative of events, grid stress, and/or grid instability , over the wide area. \nId. This step merely instructs the user to analyze the data. That is an abstract idea. TaK.aDu's \nclaims teach ways of analyzing the data. The '983 and '392 patents teach a comparison between \npredicted and actual values to determine anomalous events. The '106 patent teaches methods of \nrelating two previously unrelated events though use of event combination rules. The '519 patent \nteaches a way of enriching GIS data and then analyzing the enriched data to gain insights into the \nutility system. There is an \"important common-sense distinction between ends sought and \nparticular means of achieving them, between desired results (functions) and particular ways of \nachieving (performing) them.\" Elec. Power Grp., 830 F.3d at 1356. TaKaDu's patents teach \nparticular ways of achieving data analysis. \nI agree with TaK.aDu that CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic , Inc, 955 F.3d 1358 (Fed. Cir. \n2020) is a more apt comparison. In CardioNet, the patent described \"cardiac monitoring systems \nand techniques for detecting and distinguishing atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter from other \nvarious forms of cardiac arrythmia. \" Id. at 1362. The Federal Circuit held, \"The claims are \ndrawn to a device for detecting and reporting the presence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in a \npatient. Specifically , the device detects beat-to-beat timing of cardiac activity, detects premature \nventricular beats (irregular beats that interrupt the normal heart rhythm), and determines the \nrelevance of the beat-to-beat timing to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, taking into account the \n9 variability in the beat-to-beat timing caused by premature ventricular beats.\" Id. at 1364-65. \nTaKaDu's patents similarly use data to detect abnormalities in a utility network and report events \nsuch as leakage events. On one level, the claims involve collecting , analyzing, and reporting \ndata. A careful consideration of the claim requirements in light of the written description, \nhowever, shows that the claims are directed toward a technological improvement. See id. at \n1371. \nInnovyze argues that the claims do not improve computer technology. (D.I. 9 at 11-12, \n16, 19). TaKaDu responds, \"the claims improve the capabilities of modeling, operating , and \nmonitoring a water / resource distribution utility network in totality by incorporating a specific \nimplementation of a solution that addresses express technical problems.\" (D.I. 13 at 16). I \nagree. \"Abstraction is avoided or overcome when a proposed new ... computer-implemented \nfunction is not simply the generalized use of a computer as a tool to conduct a known or obvious \nprocess, but instead is an improvement to the capability of the system as a whole.\" Trading \nTechs. Int'!, Inc. v. CQG, INC, 675 F. App'x 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 2017). TaKaDu's patents \nteach improved computer systems that use specific modes of data analysis. This contrasts with, \nfor example, the patents at issue in Fair Warning IP, LLC v. Iatric Sys., Inc., 839 F.3d 1089 (Fed. \nCir. 2016). There, the patent claimed methods detecting fraudulent access to a patient's personal \nhealth information. Id. at 1092. The method involved collecting and analyzing data according to \ncertain rules. Id. The Federal Circuit explained , \nThe claimed rules ask whether accesses of [personal health information] are 1) \"by a \nspecific user,\" 2) \"during a pre-determined time interval,\" or 3) \"in excess of a specific \nvolume.\" These are the same questions (though perhaps phrased with different words) \nthat humans in analogous situations detecting fraud have asked for decades, if not \ncenturies. Although FairWarning 's claims require the use of a computer, it is this \nincorporation of a computer , not the claimed rule, that purportedly 'improve[s] [the] \nexisting technological process' by allowing the automation of further tasks.\" \n10 Id at 1094-95 ( citations omitted). Here, in contrast, it is the method of analysis itself (that is, \nthe claimed rule) that improves the existing technological process. \nInnovyze argues that the claims recite mental processes that can be performed by a \nhuman. (DJ. 9 at 11, 15, 18). TaKaDu responds that the methods and systems recited by the \npatents \"are highly complicated and are not traditional tasks that an individual can perform with \njust pen and paper to meet the goals of the claimed inventions.\" (D.I. 13 at 16). Given that the \npatents involve statistical analysis and manipulation of GIS data, I agree with TaKaDu. At this \nstage in the proceedings there is no clear and convincing evidence that these patents merely \nrecite steps that can be performed in a human mind. See Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L. v. LG \nElecs., Inc., 880 F.3d 1356, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (\"A patent is presumed valid, and the burden \nof establishing invalidity of a claim rests on the party asserting invalidity by clear and \nconvincing evidence.\"). \nBecause I find that the patents are not directed to an abstract idea at Alice step one, I do \nnot need to consider whether the claims recite an inventive concept at Alice step two. CardioNet , \n955 F.3d at 1371. \nIV.
