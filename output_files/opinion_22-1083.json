BLANCO ,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22-1 083-RGA  \n      : ERIC JORDAN,     :        :   Defendant.    : \n \n Ivonne A. Blanco, Wilmington, Delaware.   Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n December 6, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Ivonne A. Blanco appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed \nin forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4 ).  She commenced this action on August 17, 2022.  (D.I. 2).  \nThe Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff sues Defendant  Eric Jordan, a federal official for the \nCity of New York.  (D.I. 2 at 3).   The Complaint is basically unintelligible.   Attached to \nthe Complaint  are newspaper article s about a cattle -rustling case, Netflix, and Twitter. 0F1  \n(D.I. 2-1).   Plaintiff states her injuries are \u201cpr oprietary or trade secret information.\u201d  ( D.I. \n2 at 7).  F or relie f, Plaintiff seeks , \u201cNetFlix sig hs in relief.\u201d 1F2  (Id.)  \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the scr eening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \na pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \n \n1 Plaintiff has filed numerous exhibits.  ( See D.I. 6  through D.I. 16).  \n2 This language is taken from one of the attached newspaper articles .  (D.I. 2 -1 at 5)  2 \n Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, h er \npleading is liberally construed and her  Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. at  94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .   \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)  and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claim s for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant P laintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements  of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted.  See id . at 1 1.  3 \n  A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause t hey are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is pl ausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \n The allegations are basically unintelligible.  The Court finds them fantastical \nand/or delusional and insuffic ient to withstand the evaluation for frivolity dismissal under \n' 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).  See Denton v. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 32- 33 (1992)  (a complaint \nmay be dismissed as lacking a basis in fact if it is premised upon \u201c allegations that are \nfanciful, \u2018fantastic, \u2019= and >delusional[.] =@); Golden v. Coleman, 429 F. App= x 73 (3d Cir. \n2011).   In addition, a federal court may sua sponte dismiss a complaint for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) when the allegations within the C omplaint Aare so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be \nabsolutely devoid of merit, .  . . wholly insubstantial, .  . . obv iously frivolous, ... plainly \nunsubstantial, .  . . or no longer open to discussion. @  Hagans v.  Lavine, 415 U .S. 528, \n536B37 (1974) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) .  This is clearly the case \nhere.  The Court =s experience and common sense lead it to recognize that the 4 \n complaint does not state a plausible claim for relief  and, therefore, the Complaint will be \ndismissed.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 67.  \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B )(i) and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Amendment is futile.  \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nIVONNE A. BLANCO,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1083- RGA  \n      : ERIC JORDAN,     :        :   Defendant.    : \n \n \nORDER  \n \n At Wilmington this 6th day of  December , 2022 , for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \n IT IS ORDERED that:  \n1.
