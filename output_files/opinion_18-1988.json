Circuit Judge:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPending before the Court is a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d) filed by Petitioner Waymond E. Wright (\u201cPetitioner\u201d). (D.I. 3) The State filed\nan Answer in Opposition. (D.I. 13) For the reasons discussed, the Court will dismiss the Petition.\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nThis case stems from Petitioner\u2019s two robberies of two different victims on August 18, 2012:\nJuan Ambrosio and Angel Olivares. (D.I. 14-4 at 23) The State eventually dropped the charges\nagainst Petitioner for the Ambrosio robbery, but continued its prosecution of Petitioner for his role\nin the robbery of Angel Olivares \u2014 which is the focus of this case. At the time of Petitioner\u2019s trial,\nAngel Olivares was in Mexico. (Id.) The following background pertains to the Olivares robbery.\n\nOn August 18, 2012, a woman accosted Olivares as he walked along a path behind\napartments in the vicinity of 1511 North DuPont Highway in New Castle, Delaware. (D.I. 13 at 2-\n3) As Olivares attempted to get away from the woman, two men joined her and, with aggressive\nmovements, restrained Olivares and took a wallet from his pocket. The robbery was witnessed by a\nlocal storeowner, Carlos Sanchez (\u201cSanchez\u201d). (Id. at 3) Police were summoned, and Sanchez\nptovided investigators with surveillance video captured by cameras located on the exterior of his\nstore. The video supported Sanchez\u2019s description of the robbery. Olivares was seen going from the\nWaWa to the apartments through the shortcut. The two men and one woman who participated in\nthe crime could be seen in the video footage. (Id.)\n\nOn November 5, 2012, a New Castle County grand jury indicted Petitioner and his two co-\ndefendants, Steven Huff (\u201cHuff\u201d) and Natasha Mahaley (\u201cMahaley\u201d), for two counts of first degree\n\nrobbery, two counts of second degree conspiracy, possession of a firearm during the commission of\na felony (\u201cPFDCP\u2019), and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony\n(\u201cPDWDCF\u201d). (D.I. 13 at 1)\n\n[Petitioner], along with co-defendants Mahaley and Huff, began their\njoint trial on July 9, 2013. During jury selection, [Petitioner] brought\nup, for the first time and via oral motion, the immigration status of the\nState\u2019s witnesses including the State\u2019s first witness and alleged robbery\nvictim, Juan Ambrosio (\u201cAmbrosio\u201d). Discussion of the issue required\nsignificant delays, with the end result being that Ambrosio invoked his\nFifth Amendment privilege after the start of his testimony. His\ntestimony was stricken, separate charges involving an incident against\nAmbrosio (including a weapons charge) were dropped, and the jury\nwas instructed to disregard his testimony. At the time, the [Superior]\nCourt stated \u201cthere are novel and complex issues presented, so we\u2019ve\nhad more recesses than ordinarily anyone would like, but I think it\u2019s\nbeen necessary to have taken the time.\u201d\n\nOn July 11, 2013, shortly after it became clear Ambrosio would not\ntestify and some of the charges were dropped, Mahaley entered a guilty\nplea to Conspiracy Second Degree and the State\u2019s second witness\nCarlos Sanchez (\u201cSanchez\u201d) began to testify. The next day, Huff also\nentered a guilty plea to Conspiracy Second Degree and Robbery\nSecond Degree. The juty was instructed not to attribute the delays in\ntrial to [Petitioner].... Both Mahaley and Huff testified for the State.\nState v. Wright, 2014 WL 4088685, at *1-2 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 19, 2014).\n\nThe jury convicted Petitioner of second degree robbery and second degtee conspiracy with\nrespect to the robbery of Angel Olivares. (D.I. 13 at 2) On September 11, 2015, the Superior Court\nsentenced Petitioner as an habitual offender to fourteen years at Level V incarceration for the\nsecond degree robbery, and to two years at Level V incarceration for the second degree criminal\nsolicitation conviction, suspended for two years at Level IV, suspended after six months for\ndecreasing levels of supervision. (D.I. 14-3 at 16-21) After his conviction, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\n\nmoved for a judgment of acquittal or, alternatively, for a new trial. See Wright v. State, 196 A.3d 413\n\n(Table), 2018 WL 5251911, at *1 (Del. Oct. 19, 2018). The Superior Court denied the motion, and\nthe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions on direct appeal. See State Wright v.\nState, 143 A.3d 748 (Table), 2016 WL 3453707 (Del. May 23, 2016).\n\nOn November 20, 2016, Petitioner filed in the Superior Coutt a pro se motion for\npostconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d)\nfollowed by an amended Rule 61 motion. (D.I. 14-1 at 16, Entry No. 83; D.I. 14-15 at 174-75) On\nMarch 6, 2018, the Superior Court denied Petitioner\u2019s amended Rule 61 motion. See State \u00bb. Wright,\n2018 WL 1215884 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 6, 2018). The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that\ndecision on October 19, 2018. See Wright v. State, 196 A.3d 413 (Table), 2018 WL 5251911 (Del.\nOct. 19, 2018).\n\nIII. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\nA. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\n\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the\npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b);\nO'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). The\nAEDPA states, in pertinent part:\n\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in\ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted\n\nunless it appears that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of\nthe State; or\n\n(B)@ there is an absence of available State corrective process; or\n(i) citcumstances exist that render such process ineffective to\nprotect the rights of the applicant.\n\n28 US.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).\nThe exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to give\n\u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete\nround of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O'Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844-45; see also\nWerts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). A petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement\nby demonstrating that the habeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either\non direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court to\nconsider the claims on their merits. See Bel/ \u00bb. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples,\n489 US. 346, 351 (1989).\n\nA petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused if state procedural rules\npreclude him from seeking further relief in state courts. See Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 (3d\nCir. 2000); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 297-98 (1989). Although treated as technically exhausted, ~\nsuch claims are nonetheless procedurally defaulted. See Lines, 208 F.3d at 160; Coleman v. Thompson,\n501 U.S. 722, 750-51 (1991). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state\u2019s highest\ncourt, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the merits of the claim due to an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted.\nSee Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the\npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting\ntherefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the court does not review the\nclaims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To\ndemonstrate cause for a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor\nexternal to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d\nMurray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show\n\n4\n\u201cthat [the errors at trial] worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial\nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d Id. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, a federal court may excuse a procedural default if the petitioner demonstrates\nthat failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v.\nCarpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). A petitioner\ndemonstrates a miscarriage of justice by showing a \u201cconstitutional violation has probably resulted in\nthe conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. Actual innocence means\nfactual innocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bows/ey v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). In\norder to establish actual innocence, the petitioner must present new reliable evidence \u2014 not\npresented at trial \u2014 that demonstrates \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have\nfound petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d had it been presented with such evidence. House\nv. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 537-38 (2006); see Sweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 522-24 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\nIfa state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the federal court\nmust review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if the state court\u2019s decision was\n\u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was an\nunreasonable determination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see also Wilkams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel \u00bb. Horn, 250 F.3d 203,\n210 (3d Cir. 2001). A claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254(d) if the state court decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, rather\nthan on a procedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\n5\nThe deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state coutt\u2019s order is unaccompanied by\nan opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98\n(2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cit may be presumed that the state court adjudicated\nthe claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the\ncontrary.\u201d Id. at 99.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the state court\u2019s\ndeterminations of factual issues ate correct. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This presumption of\ncorrectness applies both to explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is only rebutted by clear and\nconvincing evidence to the contrary. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280,\n286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-E/ \u00bb. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 341 (2003) (stating that clear and convincing\nstandard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies to factual issues, whereas unreasonable application standard of\n\u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to factual decisions).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nPetitioner\u2019s timely-filed Petition asserts the following seven grounds for relief: (1) trial\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to impeach a prosecution witness with evidence\nthat was exculpatory and would have demonstrated that the witness\u2019 testimony was untruthful;\n\n(2) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request a cautionary instruction after\nPetitioner\u2019s co-defendants entered guilty pleas mid-trial; (3) the State violated Brady v. Maryland, 373\nUS. 83 (1963), by withholding the first of two proffers made by co-defendant Huff because the\nproffer could have been used to impeach Huff (D.I. 3 at 9); (4) trial counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to object to the introduction of his co-defendants\u2019 plea agreements, which he\ncontends were used as substantive proof of his guilt.; (5) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\nimpeach co-defendant Mahaley\u2019s testimony by using her prior inconsistent and exculpatory\n\n6\nstatement; (6) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to impeach co-defendant Huff\nwith Huff's proffer; and (7) appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to challenge\nthe Superior Court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal and his motion for new trial\nbased on insufficient evidence of a conspiracy.\n\nA. Claims One, Two, Four, Five and Six: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\n\nPetitioner presented the ineffective assistance of trial counsel arguments in Claims One,\nTwo, Four, Five and Six to the Superior Court in his Rule 61 motion, which denied the Claims as\nmeritless. See Wright, 2018 WL 1215884, at *2-3. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the\nSuperior Court\u2019s decision on post-conviction appeal. See Wright, 2018 WL 5251911, at *1.\nTherefore, Claims One, Two, Four, Five, and Six will only warrant relief if the Delaware state court\ndecisions were either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\n\nThe clearly established federal law governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the\ntwo-pronged standard enunciated in Strickland v, Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and its progeny.\nSee Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003). Under the first Swrick/and prong, a petitioner must\ndemonstrate that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with\nreasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel rendered\nassistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second Siick/and prong, a petitioner must\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id at 694. A reasonable probability is a\n\u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id A court can choose to address\nthe prejudice prong before the deficient performance prong, and reject an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim solely on the ground that the defendant was not prejudiced. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n\n698.\nIn order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must make\nconcrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk summary dismissal. See Wells \u00bb.\nPetsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991); Dooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1987).\nAlthough not insurmountable, the Sirick/and standard is highly demanding and leads to a \u201cstrong\npresumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\nWith respect to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, a \u201cstate court decision is contrary\nto clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in\nSupreme Court precedent, or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a\ndecision of [the Supreme] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that reached by\nthe Supreme Court.\u201d Eley \u00bb. Erickson, 712 F.3d 837, 846 (3d Cir. 2013). Here, the Delaware state\ncourt decisions were not contrary to Strick/and because they correctly identified the Strickland\nstandard applicable to Claims One, Two, Four, Five and Six. See Wilhams, 529 U.S. at 406 (\u201c[A] run-\nof-the-mill state-court decision applying the correct legal rule from [Supreme Court] cases to the\nfacts of a prisonet\u2019s case [does] not fit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause.\u201d).\n\nThe Court must also determine if the Delawate state courts reasonably applied the Strickland\nstandard to the facts of Petitioner\u2019s case. When performing the second prong of the\n\u00a7 2254(d) inquiry, the Court must review the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision with respect to\n\nPetitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel Claims through a \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens.\u201d See Richter,\n\n2As explained by the Richter Coutt,\n\n[t]he standards created by Strickland and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u201chighly\n\ndeferential,\u201d and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.\n\nThe Strickland standard is a general one, so the range of reasonable\n\napplications is substantial. Federal habeas courts must guard against\n8\n562 U.S. at 105. The relevant question when analyzing counsel\u2019s performance under the \u201cdoubly\ndeferential lens\u201d \u201cis not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable, [but rather], whether there is any\nteasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strick/ands deferential standard.\u201d Id. In turn, when\nassessing prejudice under Sirick/and, the question is \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result would\nhave been different\u201d but for counsel\u2019s performance, and the \u201clikelihood of a different result must be\nsubstantial, not just conceivable.\u201d Id Finally, when viewing a state court\u2019s determination that a\nStrickland claim lacks merit through the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief is precluded \u201cso long\nas fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d Id. at 101.\n\nThe Superior Court provided the following reasoning for denying Claims One, Two, Four,\nFive, and Six:\n\nIf [Petitioner] fails to demonstrate one of the two Strickland prongs,\nthis Court need not address the other prong. Nevertheless, the Court\nwill address both prongs under Strick/and. First, [Petitioner] has not\ndemonstrated that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness. There is a strong presumption that\ncounsel\u2019s conduct fell within a wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance. Just because a defendant and attorney disagree as to how\na witness was questioned does not mean that the attorney\u2019s conduct\ndid not fall within this range and that the attorney did not exercise\nsound trial strategy. Furthermore, the Delaware Supreme Court has\nheld that \u201cwhen the determination of facts turns on a question of\ncredibility and the acceptance or rejection of the testimony of\nwitnesses appearing before the trier of fact, those findings of the trier\nof fact will be approved upon review, and the reviewing court will\nnot substitute its opinion for that of the trier of fact .. . a verdict will\nnot be set aside because it was based on conflicting testimony.\u201d In\naddition, this Court stated in [ruling on Petitioner\u2019s] Motion for\nJudgment of Acquittal that \u201c. . . inconsistencies were properly\nresolved by the jury and the facts of this case fail to rise to the \u2018rare\ncase\u2019 contemplated when awarding a judgment of acquittal.\u201d\n\nthe danger of equating unreasonableness under Strickland with\nunreasonableness under \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nRichter, 562 U.S. at 105 (internal citations omitted).\n\n9\nThe facts of this case at trial were decided by the jury, including any\ninconsistencies in the witnesses\u2019 statements. The jury and this Court,\nin its August 19, 2014 denial of [Petitioner\u2019s] Motion for Judgment\nof Acquittal and New Trial, found that there was sufficient evidence\nto convict [Petitioner]. Furthermore, Mr. Koyste [trial counsel] and\nMs. Reynolds [appellate counsel] supplied affidavits, which\nsupported their decisions at trial. Mr. Koyste stated that he did not\nintroduce certain evidence \u201cbased on a strategic decision\u201d as certain\nevidence would have been harmful to the defense. Ms. Reynolds\nstated that \u201cupon careful review and analysis of the trial record in this\ncase, I arrived at the conclusion that such argument had no merit,\nand I could not ethically advocate that argument on appeal.\u201d\n[Petitioner] has not satisfied the Strickland standard.\nWright, 2018 WL 1215884, at *2-3 (cleaned up).\n\n1. Claim One: Trial counsel\u2019s failure to\nimpeach witness with prior recorded statement\n\nIn Claim One, Petitioner contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach a\nprosecution witness with the witness\u2019 prior recorded statement. Petitioner does not identify the\nwitness, the testimony, or the portion of the witness\u2019 prior statement he believes constituted\nsubstantive exculpatory evidence and/or could have been used to impeach the witness. After\nreviewing the record of Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 proceeding, it appears that the witness is the store\nowner, Sanchez, and the relevant portion of Sanchez\u2019s prior statement is the statement Sanchez gave\nto a defense investigator describing Petitioner\u2019s actions during the robbery. In his Rule 61\nproceeding, Petitioner argued that Sanchez\u2019s prior statement provided inconsistent yet exculpatory\nevidence because Sanchez stated he saw the \u201cwhite female grab and then reach into [the victim\u2019s]\npockets and remove his wallet.\u201d (D.I. 14-17 at 122) Petitioner viewed Sanchez\u2019s statement as\nsupporting Petitioner\u2019s theory that he (Petitioner) was acting as a good Samaritan by trying to \u201chelp\u201d\nthe robbery victim. (See D.I. 14-17 at 134) Trial counsel\u2019s Rule 61 affidavit, however, asserts that\ntrial counsel did not view Sanchez\u2019s statement in the same way. Notably, trial counsel explains that\n\n10\nhe made the strategic decision not to use Sanchez\u2019s interview because \u201cthe statements of Mr.\nSanchez would have been detrimental to the defense\u201d and \u201cwould have added to the strength of the\nState\u2019s case.\u201d (D.I. 14-15 at 126, 128) Trial counsel interpreted Sanchez\u2019s prior statement as\nindicating that Petitioner was \u201chelping\u201d his co-defendant Huff commit the robbery, and not acting\nas a good Samaritan, which would have been hurtful to Petitioner\u2019s defense. (D.I. 14-15 at 128) In\nfact, on the transcript of Sanchez\u2019s statement to the investigator, trial counsel wrote the word\n\u201cBAD\u201d next to the portion of the statement in question. (D.I. 14-17 at 134.35)\n\nAfter reviewing the record and trial counsel\u2019s Rule 61 affidavit, the Superior Court\ndetermined that Petitioner did not overcome Strickland strong presumption that \u201ccounsel\u2019s conduct\nfell within a wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Wright, 2018 WL 1215884, at *2.\nThe Superior Court explained that, \u201c[jJust because a defendant and an attorney disagree as to how a\nwitness was questioned does not mean that the attorney\u2019s conduct did not fall within this range and\nthat the attorney did not exercise sound trial strategy.\u201d Id. The Superior Court further held that\nPetitioner failed to \u201cadequately substantiate any allegation of actual prejudice,\u201d as required by\nStrickland. Id. at * 3. When affirming the Superior Court\u2019s denial of Claim One, the Delaware\nSupreme Court reviewed the state court record and concluded that trial counsel\u2019s decision to forego\nadmitting Sanchez\u2019s prior statement was neither deficient nor prejudicial. See Wright, 2018 WL\n5251911, at *1.\n\nThe record supports the Delaware state court conclusions. Petitioner admitted that he was\nat the scene, the videotape evidence corroborated Sanchez\u2019s testimony, and the testimony provided\nby Huff and Mahaley was consistent with the videotape evidence and Sanchez\u2019s testimony.\nConsequently, the Court concludes that reasonable jurists could agree that trial counsel did not\nperform deficiently by not admitting the statement Sanchez gave to the defense investigator. See\n\n11\nRichter, 562 U.S. at 105 (\u201cWhen \u00a7 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were\nreasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied\nStricklands deferential standard.\u201d).\n\nIn addition, Petitioner has failed to establish prejudice, because he has not demonstrated a\nreasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different but for trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to introduce Sanchez\u2019s prior statement. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Delaware\nstate courts\u2019 rejection of Claim One was not unreasonable under the doubly deferential lens of\nAEDPA and Strickland.\n\n2. Claim Two: Trial counsel\u2019s failure to seek a cautionaty\ninstruction regarding Huff and Mahaley\u2019s guilty pleas\n\nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing request an\nadditional cautionary instruction regarding Huff's and Mahaley\u2019s guilty pleas, which occurred mid-\ntrial. Petitioner presented this same argument in his Rule 61 motion, stating that trial counsel should\nhave requested \u201can instruction to the jury not to draw [an] improper inference from the guilty pleas\nthat the remaining defendant is also guilty.\u201d (D.I. 14-17 at 125) Relying on trial counsel\u2019s Rule 61\naffidavit and its prior reasons for denying Petitioner\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal and new\ntrial, the Superior Court concluded that trial counsel\u2019s failure to seek a cautionary instruction did not\nfall below an objective standard of reasonableness and did not prejudice Petitioner. The Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed that decision, holding that the Superior Court properly considered all of\nPetitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims under Sirick/and and determined that the claims\nwere without merit.\n\nAfter reviewing the record, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts reasonably\n\napplied Strickland in denying Claim Two. Although trial counsel did not seek an additional\n\n12\ncautionary jury instruction, the modified B/and instruction\u2019 on accomplice testimony that the\nSuperior Court actually provided to the jury included cautionary language, as indicated by the\nhighlighted text in the following excerpt:\n\nA portion of the evidence presented by the State is the\ntestimony of admitted participants in the crime with which this\ndefendant is charged. For obvious reasons, the testimony of\nan alleged accomplice should be examined by you with more\ncare and caution than the testimony of a witness who did\nnot participate in the crime charged. This rule becomes\nparticularly important when there is nothing in the evidence,\ndirect or circumstantial, to cortoborate the alleged\naccomplices\u2019 accusation that this defendant participated in the\ncrime.\n\nWithout such corroboration, you should not find the\ndefendant guilty unless, after careful examination of the alleged\naccomplices\u2019 testimony, you ate satisfied beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that it is true and that you may safely rely upon it. Of\ncourse, if you ate so satisfied, you would be justified in relying\nupon it, despite the lack of corroboration, and in finding the\ndefendants guilty.\n\n(D.I. 14-4 at 286-87) (emphasis added) Additionally, after each co-defendant pled guilty during trial,\nthe Superior Court instructed the jury that the co-defendant had resolved his or her charges and he\nor she was no longer on trial. (D.I. 14-14 at 72; D.I. 14-15 at 4) Immediately after informing the\njury that Huff was no longer on trial, the Superior Court also instructed the jury that any delay\n\nrelated to resolving the co-defendants\u2019 cases should not be attributed to Petitioner. (D.I. 14-15 at 4)\n\n3In Bland v. State, 263 A.2d 286 (Del. 1970), the Delaware Supreme Court crafted a model jury\ninstruction for cases \u201creliant on the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices.\u201d McMullen v. State,\n253 A.3d 107, 120 (Del. 2021). In Brooks v. State, 40 A.3d 346, 350 (Del. 2012), the Delaware\nSupreme Court \u201cheld that a trial judge who fails to give an instruction about accomplice testimony\ncommits plain error,\u201d and stated that \u201ctrial judges must give a modified version of the instruction\nfrom Bland \u00bb. State whenever the State offers accomplice testimony against the accused.\u201d McMullen,\n253 A.3d at 120.\n\n13\nMoreover, when Huff and Mahaley testified against Petitioner, trial counsel exposed their\nbiases with extensive cross-examination about their plea negotiations and extremely favorable pleas.\nThe transcript of trial counsel\u2019s closing shows that he vigorously argued the content of the Bland\ninstruction and its requirement that the jury view the testimony of admitted participants with\ncaution. (D.I. 14-4 at 274-75) This record supports trial counsel\u2019s assertion in his Rule 61 affidavit\nthat he \u201cproperly addressed\u201d the issue of the co-defendants\u2019 guilty pleas \u201cwith a Bland jury\ninstruction which was presented to the jury during the jury charge phase of the trial.\u201d (D.I. 14-17 at\n158)\n\nAfter considering the totality of the evidence at trial, the Superior Court\u2019s modified Bland\ninstruction, Mahaley and Huff\u2019s testimony, trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Mahaley and Huff,\nand trial counsel\u2019s ability to argue the issues of credibility and conflicts to the jury, the Court\nconcludes that Petitioner has failed to show a reasonable probability that the result of the\nptoceeding would have been different if the jury had been provided with an additional instruction\nnot to infer that Petitioner was guilty based on Huff\u2019s and Mahaley\u2019s guilty pleas. In short, since the\njury had sufficient evidence to assess Huff's and Mahaley\u2019s credibility, the Delaware state court\nrulings were not \u201cso lacking in justification that there was an etror well understood and\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Richter, 562 U.S.\nat 103. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Two for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\n\n3. Claim Four: Trial counsel did not object to\nintroduction of Huffs and Mahaley\u2019s plea agreements\n\nIn Claim Four, Petitioner argues that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not\nobjecting to the introduction of his co-defendants\u2019 plea agreements, which he contends were used as\n\nsubstantive proof of his guilt. The Delaware state courts rejected this Claim under both prongs of\n\n14\nStrickland. The Delaware state courts did not unreasonably apply Strickland when denying Claim\nFour.\n\nIn his supplemental Rule 61 affidavit, trial counsel asserts that he strategically decided to\nrefrain from objecting to Huff's and Mahaley\u2019s plea agreements. (D.I. 14-17 at 154) He explains\nthat the introduction of the plea agreements was beneficial to the defense as \u201cimpeachment material\not information, as the plea agreement of a Co-Defendant is used by a defense attorney to show bias\non the part of an individual who receives a benefit by pleading guilty to less offenses than what is\ncharged, or is able to receive favorable treatment when sentence[ed].\u201d (D.I. 14-17 at 154)\n\nThe record reveals that trial counsel\u2019s strategic decision was reasonable. At sidebar, trial\ncounsel explained, \u201cI believe I can cross-examine with the rejected plea offer... .\u201d (D.1. 14-15 at\n44) The State objected, and the Superior Court overruled, finding:\n\nI think it goes to bias to some extent. I understand how plea\n\nnegotiations get implicated, but I think that is trumped by the bias issue\n\ninvolving the severity of the original plea offer; not that it wasn\u2019t\n\nnecessatily appropriate, but it was heavily negotiated.\n(id) Trial counsel then questioned Huff and Mahaley about the progression of their plea\nnegotiations, their potential sentences before the pleas, their sentences as a result of the pleas, and\nthe benefit they received by testifying against Petitioner. (D.I. 14-15 at 47-50, 70-71) The bias\nhighlighted by trial counsel \u2014 as shown by the lenient sentencing recommendations in the plea\nagreements \u2014 outweighed any substantive evidence the plea agreements might be considered to\nconstitute. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts reasonably applied\n\nStrickland when holding that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of Huff\u2019s and\n\nMahaley\u2019s plea agreements did not amount to constitutionally ineffective assistance.\n\n15\n4. Claims Five and Six: Failure to impeach co-defendants with guilty pleas\n\nIn Claim Five, Petitioner asserts trial counsel should have impeached co-defendant Mahaley\nwith her prior statements because they were inconsistent and exculpatory. In Claim Six, Petitioner\ncontends that trial counsel should have impeached co-defendant Huff with Huffs proffer.\nPetitioner, however, does not identify the inconsistencies or exculpatory nature of Mahaley\u2019s prior\nstatements. As for Petitioner\u2019s contention regarding Huff's proffer, Petitioner appears to believe\nthat Huff made two proffers \u2014 one on Thursday July 11, 2013 and one on Friday July 12, 2013 \u2014 and\nthat Huffs proffer on Thursday July 11, 2013 caused the State to withdraw a plea offer it had\nextended to Petitioner at an earlier time. Petitioner is mistaken. The record demonstrates that Huff\nonly made one proffer \u2014 on Friday July 12, 2013. (D.I. 14-2 at 16-17; D.I. 14-15 at 59) As the\nCourt explains more thoroughly in its subsequent discussion of Claim Three, it was Mahaley, not\nHuff, who made the proffer on Thursday July 11, 2013 that caused the State to withdraw its plea\noffer. See infra at Section IV.C.\n\nTo reiterate, the record reveals that trial counsel thoroughly attacked the credibility of both\nco-defendants on cross-examination, including their prior crimes of dishonesty. Based on the\ntotality of the record, and given Petitioner\u2019s failure to substantiate his instant assertions, Petitioner\nhas failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been\ndifferent but for trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach his co-defendants with unidentified\ninconsistencies and Huff's non-existent second proffer. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claims\nFive and Six for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nB. Claim Seven: Appellate Counsel Provided Ineffective Assistance\n\nAppellate counsel presented one argument on direct appeal: that the delays in the trial\nrelating to Huff's and Mahaley\u2019s pleas prejudiced Petitioner. In Claim Seven, Petitioner contends\n\n16\nthat appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue on direct appeal that there\nwas insufficient evidence to support his conspiracy conviction. When rejecting the same ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel argument in Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 proceeding, the Superior Court\nexplicitly considered the conclusion it reached when denying Petitionet\u2019s motions for judgment of\nacquittal and new trial, namely, that there was sufficient evidence to convict Petitioner. The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s Rule 61 denial on post-conviction appeal,\nholding that the Superior Court properly determined the argument was without merit under the\nStrickland standard.\n\nClaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are evaluated under the same Strickland\nstandard applicable to claims alleging the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See Lewis v. Johnson,\n359 F.3d 646, 656 (3d Cir. 2004). An attorney\u2019s decision about which issues to raise on appeal is\nstrategic, and an attorney is not required to raise every possible non-frivolous issue on appeal. See\nJones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745 (1983); Smith v. Rabbins, 528 U.S. 259, 272 (2000). As a general rule, the\npresumption of effective assistance of appellate counsel will be overcome \u201conly when ignored issues\nare clearly stronger than those presented.\u201d S7ith, 528 U.S. at 285. In order to establish prejudice, a\npetitioner must show a reasonable likelihood that the court would have resolved the case differently\non appeal if not for counsel\u2019s deficiencies. See United States v. Mannino, 212 F.3d 835, 845 (3d Cir.\n2000).\n\nThe Superior Court\u2019s rejection of Petitioner\u2019s instant ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel argument was based on the conclusion it had reached when denying Petitioner\u2019s motions for\njudgment of acquittal and new trial, namely, that there was sufficient evidence to convict Petitioner.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s Rule 61 denial on post-conviction\n\n17\nappeal, holding that the Superior Court properly determined the argument was without merit under\nthe Strickland standard.\n\nImportantly, when denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial/judgment of acquittal, the\nSuperior Court applied the same standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence that the\nDelaware Supreme Court would have applied on direct appeal.* See Wright, 2014 WL 4088685, at\n*4, Given this record, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that appellate counsel\u2019s decision to forego\npursuing a sufficiency of the evidence claim on direct appeal fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness or that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his appeal would have\nbeen different but for appellate counsel\u2019s decision. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Seven\nfor failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nC. Claim Three: Brady v. Maryland Violation\n\nIn Claim Three, Petitioner contends that the State violated Brady \u00bb. Maryland, 373 US. 83\n(1963), by withholding the \u201cfirst proffer made by co-defendant which could\u2019ve been used to\nimpeach co-defendant.\u201d (D.I. 3 at 9) The Delaware Supreme Court denied Petitioner\u2019s Brady\nargument as ptocedurally barred and substantively without merit. See Wright, 2018 WL 5251911, at\n*2. In this proceeding, the State does not address the issue of any procedural bar and, instead,\nargues that the instant Brady argument lacks merit. Given the State\u2019s implicit waiver of Petitioner\u2019s\nprocedural default of Claim Three, the Court will review the Delaware state courts\u2019 denial of Claim\n\nThree under \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\n\n\u2018The standard of review applicable to sufficiency of the evidence claims is articulated in Jackson \u00bb.\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). When setting forth the standard of review applicable to Petitioner\u2019s\nmotion for judgment of acquittal, the Superior Court cited to State \u00bb. Owens, 2010 WL 2892701, at *4\n(el. Super. Ct. July 16, 2010) which, in turn, cites to Jackson v. Virginia.\n\n18\nIn Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. at 87, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the\nprosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the\nevidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\nprosecution.\u201d This \u201cduty to disclose such evidence is applicable even though there has been no\nrequest by the accused,\u201d and includes \u201cimpeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence.\u201d\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999). \u201cSuch evidence is material if there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different.\u201d Id. \u201cIn order to comply with Brady, therefore, the individual prosecutor has a\nduty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in\nthis case, including the police.\u201d Id at 281 (cleaned up). \u201cThere are three components of a true Brady\nviolation: The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or\nbecause it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or\ninadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d Id. at 281-82.\n\nThe premise of the instant Brady Claim appears to be Petitioner\u2019s belief that Huff made two\nproffers during the plea process, and that one of the proffers could have been used to impeach\nHuff. Petitioner is mistaken about Huff making two proffers. The origin of Petitionet\u2019s mistaken\nbelief is apparent upon review of his Rule 61 motion and the page of the trial transcript to which\nPetitioner cites\u2019 to support Claim Three. The transcript page cited by Petitioner actually contains\nthe explanation provided by Huff's counsel and the State to the Superior Court about an overlap in\ntiming between Mahaley\u2019s proffer and an extension of a plea offer to Huff. More specifically, the\n\nState explained:\n\n*Petitioner cites \u201ctranscript 7-11-13 at 58.\u201d (D.L. 3 at 9)\n\n19\nFor the sake of making a record, there was \u2014 while [Mahaley\u2019s]\nprotter was still occurring, there was a subsequent plea offer\nextended to Mr. Huff It\u2019s my understanding that he rejected\nthat plea offer. That rejection was communicated to me.\n\nHowever, at which point I ultimately indicated that once I heard the\ngeneral synopsis of what that proffer was, that there was no longer a\nplea offer on the table for Mr. Huff, it\u2019s my understanding that\nsubsequently Mr. Huff called Mr. Witherell in to further discuss the\nmatter after the plea had already been withdrawn by the State. And\nthere is a \u2014 well, I'll let Mr. Witherell speak.\n\n(DL 14-14 at 71) (emphasis added) Huff\u2019 counsel, Mr. Witherell, then stated:\n\nJudge, in the interim, while Ms. Mahaley was resolving her case, I\ncontinued to have negotiations with the State to advance Mr. Huffs\nposition. Ultimately, the State had offered him a robbery second\ndegree with a recommendation/agreement of a two-year Level V\nsentence followed by probation.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s up to the Court to make their discretion. It would be\nsubject to the statutory maximum, but that would be the State\u2019s\nposition.\n\nI communicated that to Mr. Huff, and consistent with all of the prior\npleas that \u2019've communicated to him, I was met with no plea. And he\nwould stand up and walk to the back of the room as if to leave.\n\nPrior to Ms. Mahaley coming into the courtroom or simultaneous to,\nI received a call or a note from one of the guards that my client wanted\nto speak with me, which I tell you is the first time that my client has\nactually summoned me to actually speak with me regarding a plea.\n\nAnd when I entered the room \u2014 as I was leaving here, the State\nmentioned to me that, Mr. Witherell, there\u2019s no more pleas. So I\ncommunicated that.... And the State at this point in time has elected\nnot to stand by their offer of two years.\n\n(D.I. 14-14 at 71)\nIn his Rule 61 brief on post-conviction appeal, Petitioner describes the foregoing events as\n\nfollows:\n\n20\n[Petitioner] avers, [o]n July 11, 2013, State\u2019s attorney Barzilia Axelrod,\nduring recess of trial where co-defendant Steven Huff was on trial with\nhim, Mr. Huff attorney Mr. Witherell discussed with Mr. Huff his\nfirst synopsis proffer. (rial Transcript Pg. 58, Lines 13-23; Pg. 59,\nLines 1-23; Pg. 60, Line 16) This clearly reflects and establishes that\nthe first proffer was still occurring and that there w[ere] subsequent\nplea offers extended to Mr. Huff. Mr. Axelrod ultimately indicated\nthat once he heard the general synopsis of what the proffer was, [there\nwas] no longer a plea offer on the table for Mr. Huff.\n\n[Petitioner] avers that the synopsis of first proffer State witness\n\nMr. Huff exonerates him, that was the basis for Mr. Axelrod\n\ntaking the plea offer off the table for Mr. Huff Mr. Huff became\n\n[the State\u2019s star witness against Petitioner] in the middle of trial.\n(D.I. 14-13 at 28) (emphasis added) Comparing the highlighted portion of Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61\nappeal argument with the highlighted excerpt from the trial transcript demonstrates that Petitioner\nmistakenly believes the proffer that caused the State to withdraw its plea offer on July 11, 2013 was\nHuff's proffer when, in fact, it was Mahaley\u2019s proffer. Indeed, the rest of the trial transcript\nindicates that Huff only made one proffer \u2014 on Friday July 12, 2013 \u2014 which was the day he entered\nhis guilty plea. (D.I. 14-15 at 59) Thus, to the extent Claim Three focuses on a non-existent\nadditional proffer by Huff, the Court denies the Claim as factually baseless.\n\nNevertheless, after reviewing Claim Three in context with the argument Petitioner raised in\nhis Rule 61 proceeding, the Court perceives Petitioner as potentially arguing that the State violated\nBrady v. Maryland by withholding information concerning the plea offer. The Delaware Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision on post-conviction appeal also interprets Claim Three in this manner:\n\nTo resolve any concern about [Petitioner\u2019s] exculpatory evidence\nclaim, which was not explicitly addressed in the Superior Court\u2019s order,\nwe have considered the claim on appeal and concluded that it is\nptocedurally barred and substantively without merit. The claim is\nprocedurally barred because [Petitioner] did not \u2014 and cannot \u2014\nestablish cause for failing to raise the claim earlier or prejudice from a\nviolation of his rights. The claim is without merit because [Petitioner]\n\ndid not demonstrate that the purported exculpatory evidence \u2014\n\n21\nconsisting of the contents of a prior plea offer that was rejected\nby Huff-\u2014 was favorable to [Petitioner\u2019s] defense.\n\nWright , 2018 WL 5251911 at *2 (emphasis added).\n\nTo the extent the Court should view Huffs rejected plea offer on July 11, 2013 as the focus:\nof Petitioner\u2019s Brady v. Maryland argument, the Court still concludes that his argument lacks merit.\nAs the Delaware Supreme Court held, Petitioner has not demonstrated that the rejected plea offer\ncontained impeaching or exculpatory evidence favorable to his defense. Accordingly, the Court\nconcludes that the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied Brady in denying Claim Three.\n\nD. Motion to Amend\n\nDuring the pendency of this proceeding, Petitioner filed a Motion to Amend his Petition\nwith a new claim alleging that he was denied his right to confront his accuser as guaranteed by\nCranford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004). (D.I. 18) Amendments to habeas petitions are governed\nby Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15. See United States v. Duffus, 174 F.3d 333, 336 (3d Cir. 1999).\nSince federal habeas corpus actions are subject to a one-year statute of limitations, a motion to\namend a timely filed habeas petition \u201cwill be denied where it is filed after that period expires unless\nthe proposed amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading within the meaning of\n[Rule 15(\u00a2)].\u201d Howard v. United States, 533 F.3d 472, 475-76 (6th Cir. 2008). Rule 15(c) permits\nrelation-back of a proposed amendment to a habeas petition when both the pleading and the\nptoposed amendment arise out of the same \u201cconduct, transaction, or occurrence.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P.\n15(c)(1)(B). In the habeas context, an amendment relates back to a habeas petition under Rule 15(c)\n\u201c{s]o long as the original and amended petitions state claims that are tied to a common core of\n\noperative facts.\u201d Mayle \u00bb. Felix, 545 U.S. 644, 664 (2005). A claim will not relate back, however, to\n\n22\nthe extent that it \u201casserts a new ground for relief supported by facts that differ in both time and type\nfrom those the original pleading set forth.\u201d Id. at 650.\nAs explained by the Third Circuit:\nIn searching for a common core of operative facts in the two pleadings,\ncourts should remain awate that the touchstone for relation back is fair\nnotice, because Rule 15(c) is premised on the theory that a party who\nhas been notified of litigation concerning a particular occurrence has\nbeen given all the notice that statutes of limitations were intended to\nprovide. Thus, only where the opposing party is given fair notice of\nthe general fact situation and the legal theory upon which the\namending party proceeds will relation back be allowed. For example,\nwe have held that amendments that restate the original claim with\ngteater particularity or amplify the factual circumstances surrounding\nthe pertinent conduct, transaction, or occurrence in the preceding\npleading fall within Rule 15(c) because the opposing party will have\nhad sufficient notice of the circumstances surrounding the allegations\ncontained in the amendment.\nUnited States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 101 (3d Cir. 2019) (cleaned up and citations omitted).\nA court may also deny leave to amend where the amendment would be futile. See Foman \u00bb.\nDavis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Middlebrook v. Carroll, 470 F. Supp. 2d 411, 419 (D. Del. 2007), aff'd,\n293 F. App\u2019x 858 (3d Cir. 2008). An amendment is futile if the proposed pleading could not\nwithstand a motion to dismiss. See City of Cambridge Re. Sys. v. Altisource Asset Mgmt. Corp., 908 F.3d\n872, 278 (3d Cir. 2018). Examples of futility in the habeas context include time-barred amendments\nthat do not relate back to the original petition, procedurally barred amendments, and amendments\nlacking arguable merit. See Bernard v. United States, 2019 WL 3719405, at *2 (D.N,J. Aug. 5, 2019)\n(noting that amending with time-barred claim that does not relate back would be futile); Hall \u00bb.\nPhelps, 641 F. Supp. 2d 334, 342 (D. Del. 2009).\nIn this case, although the Petition is timely, Petitioner filed his Motion to Amend long after\n\nthe expiration of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. Consequently, Petitioner\u2019s Confrontation\n\n23\nClause Claim is time-barred. In turn, Petitioner\u2019s new proposed claim does not relate back to the\noriginal Petition, because it not tied to a common core of operative facts shared with any of the\nseven Claims in his Petition. Therefore, the Court will deny Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Amend.\n\nVv. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether to\nissue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A\ncertificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the\ndenial of a constitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district\ncourt\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief. Reasonable jurists\nwould not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the Court will not issue a certificate of\nappealability.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the Petition without holding an evidentiary\n\nhearing. An appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n24\n"}
