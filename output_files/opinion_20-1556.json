Miller, SMITH , KATZENSTEIN & JENKINS LLP, Wilmington, Delaware; \nMassimo D\u2019Angelo, AKERMAN  LLP, New York, New York.  \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff s. \n \nRaymond J. DiCamillo, Christine Dealy Haynes, RICHARDS , LAYTON & FINGER , PA \nWilmington , Delaware; Christopher Andrews, COOLEY LLP, San Francisco, Califor-\nnia. \n \nCounsel for Defendants . \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \n \n \nMarch 27, 2023   \n2 BIBAS, Circuit Judge , sitting by designation.  \nUnder  Delaware law, a party  to a contract  cannot sit idly by if he knows that  his \ncounterparty is signing the contract with a mistaken belief about what it says. Plain-\ntiffs plausibly allege that  defendant Arvind Movva  did just that: sat on his hands \nwhile plaintiffs  signed agreements to invest in his company , thin king that the agree-\nments said one thing when they really  said another.  \nOf course, plaintiffs were not entitled to act unreasonably . They had a duty to act \nin good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing . But that \nduty is a fact-intensive affirmative defense , so I deny defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nOn this motion to dismiss, I take all well -pleaded facts as true. Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 5 56 (2007).  Along with the complaint itself, I may consider \nmaterials \u201cincorporated by reference or integr al to the claim.\u201d Buck v. Hampton Twp. \nSch. Dist. , 452 F.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir. 2006). Those materials include  the parties\u2019 re-\nvised 2018 investment agreements . These agreements  contain  the alleged  mistake , \nand the complaint  repeatedly refer s to them . See, e.g. , Second Am. Compl., D.I. 47 \n\u00b6\u00b6 21, 28, 31 \u201333. \nAn August 2019 email chain between plaintiffs and Movva  is also integral. Plain-\ntiffs extensively quote these emails . See, e.g. , Id. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 34. 43.  They also say the \nemails show a specific meeti ng of the minds , a necessary element of a mistake claim.  \nSee id.  Plus, plaintiffs previously agreed to my consider ing these materials . See D.I. \n46. So I consider the  complaint, the  revised 2018 notes , and the August email chain.   \n3 On to the facts: divvyD OSE  is an online pharmacy.  Second Am. Compl., D.I. 47  \n\u00b6 19. When its founder, Arvind Movva, needed money to get the company off the \nground, he turned to his dad\u2019s  coworkers . Id. \u00b6 22. In 2018, those coworkers  (plaintiffs \nhere)  invested millions . Id. \u00b6 21. Their 2018  investments took the form of convertible \ndebt: upon a triggering event , plaintiffs\u2019 loans would convert to divvyDOSE shares.  \nId. \u00b6 21. \nIn 2019 , Movva asked  for $5 million more. Id. \u00b6 23. He told plaintiffs that a sale of \ndivvyDOSE was imminent and would make  them  eight to ten times their investment. \nId. \u00b6 25. As proof  of the potential return , he pointed to  the recent sale of a divvyDOSE \ncompetitor for $1 billion. Id. \u00b6 23. \nBut as plaintiffs were contemplating the second investment, they discovered an \nissue with the first. Id. \u00b6 28. Plaintiffs had thought that , under the original 2018 \nnotes,  divvyDOSE\u2019s sale was a triggering event . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 28\u201330. In other words, they \nthought that if divvyDOSE were  sold,  their return would be based on a conversion  to \ndivvyDOSE shares . Id. They would  thus get a percentage of the sale\u2019s proceed s. But \nthe 2018 notes, which plaintiffs had not  read, said otherwise : in the event of a sale, \nplaintiffs would get their investments back, plus 50 % of the amount outstanding on \ntheir loans.  Id. \nAfter discovering  this 50% -payout provision, plaintiffs confronted Movva. Id. \u00b6 29. \nHe apologized  and promised to re -issue the notes without it. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 29\u201332. Under the \nrevised  2018  notes , he said , a sale would count as a triggering event. Id. And if con-\nversion  were triggered, plaintiffs\u2019 notes would convert to  divvyDOSE  shares with the  \n4 company\u2019s valuation  capped at  $75 million. Id. This cap made sure that plaintiffs\u2019 \nstake in the company would not get too diluted even  if the company\u2019s value surged . \nMovva also agreed that the new, 2019 investments would  convert to shares upon div-\nvyDOSE\u2019s  sale.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 29\u201332. \nMovva sent plaintiffs draft agreements for the 2019 and revised 2018 notes . Id. \n\u00b6 33. He assured plaintiffs that  he had taken a \u201c more active role\u201d in drafting  them . \nId. \u00b6 34.  \nA few days later, one of the investors , Radha Kanuri , reviewed the agreements on \na phone call with Movva. Id. \u00b6 35. Plaintiffs allege  that on this call, Movva  said the \nagreements reflected the  changes they had discussed.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 39. After  the call , \nKanuri  email ed another plaintiff -investor , saying that  he had reviewed the agree-\nments with Movva  and that they addressed his concerns . Id. \u00b6 36. Plaintiffs then \nsigned  the revised 2018 and 2019 agreements.  \nAbout a year later, divvyDOSE was sold.  Id. \u00b6 52. But plaintiffs did not get the \npayday  they were expecting . Though  their 2019 notes converted to shares , their re-\nvised 2018 notes did not. See D.I. 65 at 1.  Instead, they found out that the 50% -payout \nprovision remained . Id. \u00b6 37. To be sure, the revised 2018  agreements  did add the $75 \nmillion valuation cap  that Movva had promised . Id. \u00b6 43. But they did not add div-\nvyDOSE\u2019s sale to the category of events that would trigger conversion.  Id. \nSo plaintiffs sued  to recover the amount they would have made had  their  revised \n2018  notes converted to shares  upon divvyDOSE\u2019s sale . Previously, I dismissed with \nprejudice their fraud  claims , plus one plaintiff\u2019s  mutual -mistake claims . D.I. 39;  \n5 D.I. 40. Plaintiffs then  stipulated to dismissing  the remaining  mutual -mistake  claims \nand filed an amended complaint  alleging unilateral mistake.  See Second Am. Compl., \nD.I. 47; D.I. 48. Defendants now move to dismiss . \nII. PLAINTIFFS \u2019 UNILATERAL -MISTAKE CLAIM SURVIVES  \nOn a motion to dismiss, I ask whether , accepting all well-pleaded facts as true,  \nplaintiffs have stated a c laim to relief \u201cthat is plausible on its face.\u201d Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 570. Plaintiffs  must \u201cstate with particularity the circumstances constituting \n\u2026 mistake.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b). But they may allege mental states, like knowledge \nof the mistake,  generally . Id. \nA. Plaintiffs plausibly state a claim for unilateral mistake  \nTo state a claim for unilateral mistake  under Delaware law , plaintiffs must show  \nthat (1) they were \u201cmistaken about the contents of the final , written agreement ,\u201d \n(2) Movva  knew of the mistake but said nothing , and (3)  there was a \u201cspecific meeting \nof the minds regarding a term that was not accurately reflected in the final written \nagreement.\u201d In re 11  W. Partners, LLC , 2019 WL 1300859, at *5 (D el. Ch. Mar. 20, \n2019); see also  Scion Breckenridge Managing Member, LLC v. ASB Allegiance Real \nEst. Fund , 68 A.3d 665, 679 \u201380 (Del. 2013).  Plaintiffs plausibly allege all th ree with \nsufficient particularity .   \n1. Mistake. First , plaintiffs plausibly allege that they were mistaken about the \nrevised 2018  notes \u2019 terms . Plaintiffs thought those notes  would convert  to shares  upon \ndivvyDOSE\u2019s sale . Second Am. Compl., D.I. 47 \u00b6  37. True, if they had read the notes  \n(Kanuri only \u201creviewed \u201d them with Mov va), they would have discovered  their mis-\ntake. See D.I. 50 -2 at 3; Second Am. Compl., D.I. 47 \u00b6  36. But under Delaware law,  \n6 failing to read a contract  does not bar a claim for unilateral mistake.  Scion , 68 A.3d \nat 676 \u201377. \n2. Knowledge of mistake.  Second, plaintiffs plausibly allege that Movva  knew of \ntheir  mistake but said nothing so he could  benefit from  it. Movva took an \u201cactive role\u201d \nin drafting the revised notes . Second Am. Compl., D.I. 47 \u00b6  34. So it  is plausible that  \nhe knew  that those notes  would not convert  to shares  upon divvyDOSE\u2019s  sale.  \nIt is also plausible that he  knew that  plaintiffs were in the dark . They  had com-\nplained to him when they found  the 50%-payout provision in the original 2018 no tes. \nId. \u00b6 29. Indeed, they say that this provision was the very reason the notes were  re-\nvised and  re-issued . See id. \u00b6 45.  \nPlus, Movva had good reason to keep his mouth shut. As plaintiffs  were executing \nthe revised notes, Movva  was \u201cvery close to completing a deal\u201d to sell  divvyDOSE . \nSecond Am. Compl., D.I. 47 \u00b6  49. Limiting  plaintiffs\u2019 payout would mean more money \nfor Movva . \nDefendants insist  that Movva could not have known of plaintiffs\u2019 mistake  because  \nKanuri said that the revised agreements addressed his concerns. See D.I. 52 at  14\u2013\n15. But Kanuri\u2019s statement  was explicitly premised on having  \u201creviewed [the con-\ntracts] along with Arvind  [Movva] .\u201d  D.I. 50 -2 at 3  (emphasis added) ; see Second Am. \nCompl,  D.I. 47 \u00b6  36. If Movva misled Kanuri on that call, as plaintiffs say he did,  then \nMovva  would have known that Kanuri was  mistaken . \n3. Prior meeting of the minds.  Third, plaintiffs  plausibly  allege that the parties \n\u201ccame to a specific prior understanding that differed materially from the written  \n7 agreement.\u201d Glidepath Ltd. v. Beumer Corp. , 2018 WL 2670724, at *13 (Del. Ch. June \n4, 2018)  (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs identify a specific term  that \nshould have been cut: the 50%-payout provision.  Plus, they say that the 2019 notes \naccurately reflect  their agreement  about conversion . So I know  \u201cexactly what term s \nto insert in the contract rather than being put in the position of creating a contract \nfor the parties.\u201d  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) . \nAnd plaintiffs  plausibly  allege that the parties had agreed to the revisions . Plain-\ntiffs say  that in late August 2019, they discovered the 50% -payout provision  and com-\nplained to Movva  by email . Second Am. Compl., D.I. 47 \u00b6\u00b6  28\u201330. Movva  respon ded, \nthey say,  by apologiz ing, claim ing that it was an \u201coversight,\u201d and assur ing them  that \nit would be  deleted . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 29\u201330. Thus, plaintiffs  allege  the circumstances constitut-\ning the mistake with sufficient particularity: we know what was said (the 50% -payout \nprovision would be removed  and their debt would convert to sh ares), when it was said \n(late August 2019),  who said it (Movva),  and how  and where  it was said  (by email). \nSee Cal. Pub. Emps .\u2019 Ret. Sys. v. Chubb Corp. , 394 F.3d 126, 144 (3d Cir. 2004)  (plain-\ntiffs \u201cmust specify the who, what, when, where, and how\u201d (internal quotation marks \nomitted)) .  \nDefendants counter that , \u201c[i]n context, \u2026 Movva plainly was not referring to the \n[50% -payout provision ]\u201d when he apologized and agreed to a correction.  D.I. 52 at  12. \nBut defendants do not  explain  what else it could have been.  See id.  True,  the emails \nare not as clear as plaintiffs make them out to be.  See D.I. 54 -1. There is no explicit  \nmention of  the 50% -payout provision. Id. And there is explicit mention of  the $75  \n8 million valuation cap, so it is possible that Movva was simply agreeing to add the cap \nand nothing more (which he did). But the emails do discuss \u201canti -dilution language\u201d \nin the event of  a divvyDOSE \u201csale ,\u201d which would be irrelevant if the 50% -payout pro-\nvision remained . See id.  at 4 (discussing \u201csale of the entire company\u201d) , 5 (discussing \n\u201cscenarios of future investments and acquisitions\u201d) , 7 (discussing what would happen \nif divvyDOSE was \u201csold\u201d).  So it is possible that Movva  was agreeing  not just to add a \nvaluation cap but to delete the payout  provision  too.  \nPlus, other conversations  were interspersed with these emails . See, e.g. , Second \nAm. Compl., D.I. 47 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 3 5; D.I. 54 -1 at 3 . These conversations could add context \nto the emails, show ing that plaintiffs and Movva were clearly discussing the 50%-\npayout provision . So I cannot say that these emails  \u201ccontradict [plaintiffs\u2019] allega-\ntions\u201d such that they \u201ccontrol. \u201d Vorchheimer v. Phila . Owners Ass\u2019n , 903 F.3d 100, 112 \n(3d. Cir. 2018). Instead, I accept plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true: Movva agreed that \ndivvyDOSE\u2019s sale would be a triggering event under the revised 2018 notes.   \nDown the line,  plaintiffs will have to show a specific meeting of the mind s by \u201cclear \nand convincing evidence.\u201d Cerberus Int \u2019l, Ltd. v. Apollo Mgmt., L.P. , 794 A.2d 1141, \n1152 (Del. 2002) ; see Parke Bancorp Inc. v. 659 Chestnut LLC , 217 A.3d 701, 712 (Del. \n2019) . Crossed  wires will not suffice . I can reform the contract s only if Movva clearly \nagreed that the revised 2018 notes would convert to equity upon divvyDOSE\u2019s sale.  \nB. No affirmative defense bars plaintiffs\u2019 claims  at this stage  \nPlaintiffs are not out of the woods  just yet. Defendants also say that plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims are barred because plaintiffs  failed to act in good faith and in accordance with \nreasonable standards of fair dealing. But this good -faith -and-fair-dealing  argument   \n9 is an affirmative defense, not an element of unilateral mistake.  See Scion , 68 A.3d at \n679\u201380 (listing elements of unilateral mistake).  So it \u201cmay not afford the basis for a \ndismissal \u2026 under Rule 12(b)(6)\u201d unless it is \u201capparent on the face of the complaint.\u201d  \nBethel v. Jendoco  Const. Corp. , 570 F.2d  1168, 1174 (3d Cir. 1978) .  \nDefendants say that the complaint  clearly shows that Kanuri lied  and thus acted \nin bad faith . But defendants distort what Kanuri said . He did not say, as defendants \nclaim, that he had \u201cread\u201d the contracts. D.I. 52 at  17. He said that he had \u201creviewed\u201d \nthem with Movva. D.I. 50-2 at 3.  \nTrue,  even if Kanuri did not lie, plaintiffs\u2019  conduct  might still have been  so unrea-\nsonable  as to bar reformation. For a point of comparison, consider  Scion . There, the \nplaintiff  did not  read the contract  that contained the mistake . Scion , 68 A.3d  at 677.  \nBut he had  read an earlier version of it. See i d. at 677 \u201378. And he had asked his  \nadvisors to read the contract and inform him of any significant changes.  Id.  \nHere, by contrast, plaintiffs  do not allege that they read any version of the con-\ntract. Cf. id. at 677 n.41 (reserving the question whether plaintiff would have satisfied \nthe good -faith -and-fair-dealing standard \u201cif he had failed to read the first agree-\nment\u201d). Nor do they allege that they were relying on lawyers or advisors to review the \ncontracts for them. Worse still , after discovering the mistake in the origina l 2018 \nnotes, plaintiffs still did not check  to make sure  it was fixed  in the  revised versions.  \nSee Second Am. Compl., D.I. 47 \u00b6 36. It would not have been burdensome to check ; \nthe provision was  one prominent paragraph  on the note\u2019s second page , not a tiny de-\ntail buried in boilerplate or obscured by legal ese. See D.I. 50-2 at 48 \u00a7 2(c). Plus,  \n10 Movva specifically asked plaintiffs to check the contracts  to make sure  that their con-\ncerns had been addressed . See D.I. 50 -2 at 4 \u20135. So there is good reason to think that \nplaintiffs acted unreasonably  here. \nStill, it is not appropriate for me to throw out their  suit just yet.  Whether  plaintiffs \nacted in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing is a \nfact-specific inquiry  that requires me to go beyond the pleadings . I cannot do that  at \nthis stage.  \nC. Nor does any  anti-reliance clause bar plaintiffs\u2019 mistake claims  \nFinally, defendants say that plaintiffs\u2019 unilateral -mistake claims are barred by an \nanti-reliance  clause. In deed , in my previous opinion, I said that the relevant contracts \nhad an anti -reliance clause that barred plaintiffs\u2019 mutual -mistake claims. See D.I. 39 \nat 6. But I have \u201cinherent power \u201d to reconsider my interlocutory orders \u201cwhen it  is \nconsonant with justice to do so.\u201d In re Energy Future Holdings Corp. , 904 F.3d 298, \n310 (3d Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And after revisiting the con-\ntract s and Delaware law , as well as  reviewing  the parties\u2019 supplemental briefing , I \nfind that the clause is not an anti -reliance clause but a standard integration clause. \nSo it does not bar plaintiffs\u2019 mistake claims.  \nAn anti -reliance clause is a \u201c clear and unambiguous  contractual provision in \nwhich the plaintiffs forthrightly affirm that they are not relying upon any represen-\ntation or statement of fact not contained within the [final agreement ].\u201d Kronenberg v. \nKatz , 872 A.2d 568, 591 (Del. Ch. 2004)  (emphasis added) ; see also Abry  Partners V, \nL.P. v. F & W Acquisition LLC , 891 A.2d 1032, 1058 \u201359 (Del. Ch. 2006) (\u201c [M]urky  \n11 integration clauses, or standard integration clauses without explicit anti -reliance \nrepresentations, will not relieve a party of its oral and extra -contractual fra udulent \nrepresentations .\u201d).  \nThe provision here contains no such affirmation. It says that the parties will not \nbe liable or  bound \u201cby any representation s, warranties, covenants and agreements \nexcept as specifically set forth herein.\u201d See, e.g. , D.I. 50-2 at 55 \u00a7 5(o). It does not say \nthat the parties did not rely on extra -contractual representations when deciding \nwhether to sign  the notes . Compare id. , with MidCap Funding X Tr. v. Graebel Co s., \n2020 WL 2095899, at *7 (Del. Ch. Apr. 30, 2020)  (\u201cEach \u2026 of the parties hereto fur-\nther expressly agrees and acknowledges that it is not entering into this Agreement \nin reliance upon any representations, promises or assurance other than those ex-\npressly set forth in this Agreement.\u201d) . And \u201c Delaware Courts have concluded that \nsimilar clauses stating \u2026 that \u2018neither [the parties] nor their agents shall be bound \nby any terms, conditions , or representations not herein written \u2019 do not amount to \nclear anti -reliance language.\u201d Sanyo Electric Co.  v. Intel Corp. , 2021 WL 747719, at \n*13 (Del. Ch. Feb. 26, 2021) . \nPlus, I doubt  that Delaware courts would hold that an anti-reliance clause auto-\nmatically bars a  mistake claim of this kind.  When the mistake is about what is in the \ncontract, it  \u201cby definition involves a party who has not read, or thought about, the \nprovisions in [the]  contract carefully enough.\u201d Scion , 68 A.3d at 676  (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted) . So it makes little sense that a clause  in the contract that the  \n12 party  necessarily  admits to not hav ing read  (or read carefully  enough ) could bar his \nclaim.  \nThis, of course, does not mean that plaintiffs acted reasonably when they signed \nthe contract s. But plaintiffs\u2019  reasonableness , as explained , is an inappropriate  ques-\ntion to resolve at this stage.  Their unilateral -mistake claim thus survives, for now.  \nD. Plaintiffs may re -plead their mutual -mistake claim  \nBecause there is no anti -reliance clause, I also grant plaintiffs leave to amend \ntheir complaint to r evive their mutual -mistake claims.  \nDefendants say that even if I find that there is no anti -reliance clause, I should \nnot allow plaintiffs to plead both mutual and unilateral mistake because those claims \nare \u201cinherently inconsistent.\u201d D.I. 67 at 6. I disa gree. Rule 8(d) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure lets a party \u201cstate as many separate claims \u2026 as it has, regardless \nof consistency.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. Pro 8(d). So, if they wish,  plaintiffs may add back their \nmutual mistake claims.  \n* * * * * \nPlaintiffs plausibly state a claim for unilateral mistake. And no affirmative de-\nfense is apparent on the face of their complaint. So I deny defendants\u2019 motion to dis-\nmiss.  \n "}
