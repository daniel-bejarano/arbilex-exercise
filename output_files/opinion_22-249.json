(D.I. 23; DI. 29) For\nthe following reasons, I recommend DENYING Respondents\u2019 Motion to Vacate and\nGRANTING Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Confirm.\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nPetitioner provides litigation funding to law firms. (D.I. 2 at \u00a7 1) Hosie and Rice are\nspouses and partners of their Firm. Ud. at 5). On September 10, 2018, the parties entered into\na Law Firm Financing Agreement (\u201cLFFA\u201d), which generally provided that Petitioner would\n\nloan up to $1 million in litigation funding that Respondents would repay from successful\n\n! The briefing for the Motion to Vacate is as follows: Respondents\u2019 memorandum in support\nthereof (D.I. 24), Petitioner\u2019s response (D.L. 28), and Respondents\u2019 reply (D.I. 33).\n? The briefing for the Motion to Confirm is as follows: Petitioner\u2019s memorandum in support\nthereof (D.I. 30), Respondents\u2019 response (D.I. 36), and Petitioner\u2019s reply (D.I. 38).\n\noutcomes in cases whether by verdict, settlement, or other resolution. (Id. at [{ 8-10; see D.L. 8,\nEx. 1). Additionally, the LFFA granted Petitioner a security interest pursuant to a Deed of Trust\nin Hosie and Rice\u2019s California residence, which the LFFA defined as \u201cPartner Collateral.\u201d (DI.\n2 at 911; DL. 8, Ex. 1 at \u00a7\u00a7 1.23, 13.6)\n\nThe underlying dispute leading to the arbitration award at issue concerned whether\nRespondents\u2019 repayment obligation to the Petitioner under the LFFA was triggered when\nRespondents received a $4 million award on January 16, 2020, from arbitration of a fee dispute\nwith their former client, Space Data. (D.I. 2 at {{[ 14, 17) It is undisputed that by the end of\nApril of 2019, Respondents had borrowed approximately $800,000 in funding. (/d. at 13; see\nalso D.J. 24 at 6) On June 23, 2020, Petitioner sent a formal demand for repayment and notice of\ntermination of the LFFA effective July 1, 2020, absent satisfaction of the debt. (D.I. 2 at { 14;\nD.L. 31, Ex. 11) In August 2020, Petitioner filed a Notice of Default (\u201cNOD\u201d) and initiated\nnonjudicial foreclosure on the California residence. (D.I. 2 at \u00a2 15; D.I. 31, Ex. 31)\n\nOn September 10, 2020, pursuant to the LFFA\u2019s binding arbitration provision,\u2019\nRespondents filed an Arbitration Complaint for breach of contract and a Motion for Emergency\nRelief seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of the NOD and foreclosure\non the California residence. (D.I. 2 at \u00a2 16; D.I. 25, Ex. 7) Petitioner filed a counterclaim for\nbreach of contract, misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. (D.I. 31, Ex. 28) On October 21,\n\n2020, Otis McGee, the emergency arbitrator, enjoined the foreclosure. (D.I. 2 at J 18)\n\n3 The LFFA is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. (D.I. 8, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 18.4)\n\n4 Section 18.12 of the LFFA states: \u201cAny dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating\nto this Agreement shall be determined by final, binding, and non-appealable arbitration in\nWilmington, Delaware. . .\u201d Further, the parties agreed in the LFFA that the arbitration \u201cshall be\nadministered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.\u201d LFFA\n\u00a7 18.123. (DL. 8, Ex. 1)\nOn November 11, 2020, an arbitration panel (\u201cPanel\u201d) was appointed. (Jd. at 19) The\nPanel consisted of Kenneth M. Kramer (Chair), a lawyer experienced in arbitrating complex\ndisputes, Hon. Shirley W. Korneich, a retired judge, and Gregory P. Miller, a former military and\nfederal prosecutor. (Jd.; see D.I. 31, Exs. 22-24)\n\nOn January 4, 2021, both parties requested permission to file Summary Disposition\nmotions on issues of contract interpretation. (D.I. 25, Exs. 8-9) They \u201cagree[d] that discovery\nshould begin only after the parties file and [the] Panel decides\u201d the meaning of the contract terms\nin issue. (id, Ex. 9 at 44) On January 16, 2021, the Panel issued Pre-Hearing Order No. 2\ndenying the request, allowing discovery on \u201cissues related to the negotiation and meaning of the\nprovisions concerning \u2018Gross Revenue\u2019 and \u2018Revenue Event,\u201d and staying discovery relating to\ndamages. (D.I. 31, Ex. 12)\n\nOn February 16, 2021, the Panel changed course and issued Pre-Hearing Order No. 3\nallowing submission of briefs on whether the terms \u201cGross Revenue\u201d and \u201cRevenue Event\u201d in\nthe LFFA were ambiguous and whether the award Respondents received following arbitration of\na fee dispute with their former client, Space Data, triggered a repayment obligation to the\nPetitioner. (/d., Ex. 13 at 1) The Panel ordered that \u201c[a]ll discovery [was] stayed pending\nfurther order of the Panel.\u201d (/d. at J 4)\n\nOn May 5, 2021, following oral argument, the Panel issued Pre-Hearing Order No. 5,\ngranting the parties\u2019 joint request for Summary Disposition on the disputed contract issues which\nthe Panel would decide based on the briefs and oral argument. (/d., Ex. 14 at 94) On July 3,\n2021, the Panel issued its Summary Disposition Order concluding that \u201cunder the unambiguous\nterms of the LFFA, the amount awarded to Hosie Rice in the fee arbitration between Hosie Rice\n\nand Space Data is Gross Revenue and a Revenue Event which gives rise to a repayment\nobligation.\u201d (D.I. 8, Ex. 2 at 46) Thus, the Panel rejected Respondents\u2019 contention that the\naward in the Space Data fee dispute arbitration was for hourly, non-contingent fees for which it\nowed no repayment obligation. (/d. at 44-46) The Panel instead accepted Petitioner\u2019s\ncontractual interpretation that a repayment was triggered regardless of whether the fees were\ncontingent or based on an hourly rate. Ud.)\n\nOn July 21, 2021, Petitioner submitted its position that the appropriate next step was for\nthe Panel to assess damages in favor of Petitioner. (D.I. 31, Ex. 18) Respondents requested\nleave to file an amended Complaint. (Id, Ex. 30) The Panel issued Pre-Hearing Order No. 7\nallowing Respondents to file a Motion to Amend the Complaint (\u201cMotion to Amend\u201d) indicating\nthe Panel may choose to resolve the motion based on the briefing. (/d., Ex. 16) Respondents\nmoved to amend and their Proposed Amended Complaint (\u201cPAC\u201d) included claims for fraud in\nthe inducement (Claim 1), fraud in performance (Claim II), breach of contract (Claim II], and\ntwelve affirmative defenses. (D.I. 25, Exs. 10-11) Petitioner opposed amendment. (D.1. 31, Ex.\n26)\n\nOn October 18, 2021, the Panel issued its Order denying Respondents\u2019 Motion to Amend.\n(D.L. 8, Ex. 3) The Panel noted that the Respondents \u201c[were] aware of all of the facts that are\nnow sought to be pled as claims . . . at the time it filed its Complaint\u201d and only sought to add the\nclaims after Respondents\u2019 interpretation of the LFFA was rejected. (Jd. at 51) Notwithstanding\nRespondents\u2019 delay in asserting the claims and defenses, the Panel carefully considered the\nsubstance of the proposed amendments. (Jd. at 51-54) The Panel ruled that Respondents\u2019 fraud\nin the inducement claim was futile because of the provision waiving reliance on pre-contractual\nrepresentations. (/d. at 51) In addition, Respondents failed to plead the required scienter for\n\nfraud under Delaware law. (/d.) The fraud in performance claim was futile because\nRespondents\u2019 contractual interpretation arguments were not supported or were previously\nrejected. (Id. at 51-52) Moreover, Respondents did not identify \u201cany actionable\nmisrepresentations or omissions.\u201d (Jd. at 52) Regarding Respondents\u2019 proposed breach of\ncontract claim, the Panel denied amendment based on futility because Respondent failed to\nallege that Petitioner breached an obligation imposed by the LFFA. (Id.) The Order also\nthoroughly explained the basis for the Panel\u2019s decision denying leave to amend for all twelve\naffirmative defenses based on similar reasons of futility and insufficient pleading. (/d. at 53-54)\nRespondents\u2019 usury defense was rejected by the Panel based upon its analysis that under\nDelaware law the defense was not available to the Firm, an LLP, and the individual Respondents,\nwho were guarantors not co-borrowers. (/d. at 54)\n\nIn response to the Panel\u2019s Pre-Hearing Order No. 8, the parties submitted briefs relating\nto the damages claimed by Petitioner, in which Respondents again asserted the usury defense.\n(D.I. 31, Exs. 17, 19-20) The defense was, again, rejected by the Panel. (D.1. 8, Ex. 4 at 59) On\nMay 17, 2022, after oral argument, the Panel issued its Final Award in favor of Petitioner\ndirecting Respondents to pay damages totaling $1,817,000. (Id. at 60)\n\nOn June 1, 2022, Petitioner commenced an action in this court for confirmation of the\nFinal Award. (D.I. 1) The court heard oral argument on December 14, 2022, on the parties\u2019\ncross-motions concerning whether the Final Award should be vacated or confirmed. (D.L. 23;\nD.1. 29) For the reasons which follow, the court recommends confirmation of the Final Award\nand denial of vacatur.\n\nIll. LEGAL STANDARD\nThe FAA, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71 ef seq., governs this court\u2019s review of the Panel\u2019s Final Award.\n\nSee 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a); see also JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (\u201cJAMS\nRules\u201d) 25. (D.I. 31, Ex. 21) Federal policy favors arbitration, so courts start out with the\npresumption that the awards are enforceable. Caputo v. Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, No. 20-\n3059, 2022 WL 1449176, at *2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2022) (quotations omitted). On review, a court\u2019s\nability is \u201cseverely limited\u201d and \u201c[a]rbitration awards are set aside only in very unusual\ncircumstances.\u201d Provost v. Intrafusion Holding Corp., 926 F. Supp. 2d 532, 535 (D. Del. 2013)\n(quoting Millennium Validation Servs., Inc. v. Thompson, 2006 WL 3159821, at *4 (D. Del.\n2006) (internal quotations omitted)). \u201c{T]he sole question . . . is whether the arbitrator (even\narguably) interpreted the parties\u2019 contract, not whether he got its meaning right or wrong.\u201d\nOxford Health Plans LLC vy. Sutter, 569 U.S. 564, 569 (2013). \u201cA party seeking relief... bears\na heavy burden. .. . Because the parties bargained for the arbitrator\u2019s construction of their\nagreement, an arbitral decision even arguably construing or applying the contract must stand,\nregardless of a court\u2019s view of its (de)merits.\u201d Jd. (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\nThe FAA allows a federal court to vacate an arbitration award in four narrow\ncircumstances:\n\n(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;\n\n(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them;\n\n(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,\n\nupon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the\n\ncontroversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been\n\nprejudiced; or\n\n(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a\n\nmutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\n9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a). In Caputo, the Third Circuit recognized vacatur of an arbitration award on\nanother, non-enumerated ground, \u201cmanifest disregard of law,\u201d but questioned whether this\n\nground survives the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hall Street Assocs., L.L.C. v.\n\nMattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 585 (2008). Caputo, 2022 WL 1449176, at *2 n.11.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nRespondents admit that the FAA does not permit an arbitration award to be vacated on\ngrounds that the Panel arguably reached the wrong legal conclusion. (See D.I. 33 at 1; DI. 36 at\n3) Respondents challenge the Final Award on two enumerated grounds under the FAA and also\nargue it should be vacated for manifest disregard of law. (D.I. 24 at 2-3) Specifically, they\nargue the Panel refused to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy such that they\nwere deprived of a fair hearing under section 10(a)(3) of the FAA when the Panel denied\nRespondents the opportunity to engage in discovery and denied leave to amend their claims and\ndefenses. (Id. at 18-19; D.I. 33 at 8-10) Additionally, Respondents assert the Panel exceeded\nits authority under section 10(a)(4) of the FAA and in manifest disregard of law in finding Hosie\nand Rice \u201cguarantors\u201d and not \u201cco-borrowers\u201d entitled to usury protection under Delaware law.\n(D.L. 24 at 20-22; D.I. 33 at 2-3) The court will address each of the arguments asserted.\n\nA. Respondents Fail to Establish a Basis for Vacating the Final Award under\nSection 10(a)(3) of the FAA\n\nRespondents argue the Final Award should be vacated because they were denied a fair\nhearing without an opportunity to take discovery. (DI. 24 at 18-19) Respondents point to\nnothing in the record before the Panel of any effort they made to lift the stay and pursue\ndiscovery following the Panel\u2019s Summary Disposition Order on the contractual liability issues.\n\nRespondents were fully aware that resolution of the disputed contract terms by Summary\nDisposition would affect the scope of discovery and acknowledged the same in their letter to the\nPanel:\n\nFinally, both parties agree that discovery should begin only after the parties file and this\n\nPanel decides the Summary Judgment questions outlined above. It is difficult to police\n\nfact discovery until one knows what basic issues remain in dispute. Streamlining\n\ndiscovery is one important reason why both parties have proposed early motions on key\ncontractual meaning issues.\n\n(D.1. 25, Ex. 9 at 44) (emphasis in original)) They claim they were denied discovery regarding\nwitness testimony and document production, but there is nothing in the record demonstrating that\nRespondents ever requested any discovery following the Panel\u2019s decision on Summary\nDisposition. (D.I. 36 at 3)\n\nMoreover, once the Panel resolved the dispute over the terms \u201cGross Revenue\u201d and\n\u201cRevenue Event\u201d under the LFFA, the only issue that remained was a determination of damages.\nTherefore, the alleged lack of discovery would not have impacted the Panel\u2019s Summary\nDisposition Order finding Respondents contractually liable to Petitioner.\n\nFollowing the adverse ruling on Summary Disposition, Respondents moved to amend\ntheir claims to include fraud and breach of contract, as well as twelve additional affirmative\ndefenses. (D.I. 25, Exs. 10-11) The Panel found that Respondents\u2019 efforts to assert other claims\nand defenses following an adverse ruling on interpretation of the LFFA reflected negatively on\nthe \u201cviability\u201d of the proposed amendments. (D.I. 8, Ex. 3 at 51) The Panel denied\nRespondents\u2019 Motion to Amend. (Id. at 54)\n\nWithout citing any case authorities nor any ground under the FAA to vacate the Panel\u2019s\ndenial of a Motion to Amend, Respondents argue the Panel erred in denying their proposed fraud\nin the inducement and fraud in performance claims because they were wrongly held to the\nheightened pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). (D.I. 24 at 14) In addition, they argue the\nPanel misunderstood their breach of contract claim which Respondents state was meant to point\nout Petitioner\u2019s alleged miscalculation in the NOD of the amount due. (DJ. 36 at 9-10 (\u201cA\nlender seeking to enforce a Notice of Default through foreclosure has to get the basic math right\u201d\n\nand Petitioner \u201coverstated the amount due by $236,000\u201d))\n\u201cArbitrators have wide latitude in how they conduct proceedings; hence, a court\u2019s role in\nreviewing an arbitrator\u2019s procedural decisions is extremely limited.\u201d Sabre GLBL, Inc. v, Shan,\n779 F, App\u2019x 843, 856 (3d Cir. 2019) (internal quotations omitted). Once an arbitrator has been\nappointed, \u201cno new or different claim may be submitted, except with the Arbitrator\u2019s approval.\u201d\nJAMS Rule 10. (D.L 31, Ex. 21)\n\nHere, the Panel rejected the fraud in the inducement and fraud in performance claims as\nnot properly pled with particularity and deficient in their failure to allege scienter and\nmisrepresentations. (D.I. 8, Ex. 3 at 51) Moreover, such claims were futile because the\nintegration clause in the LFFA disclaimed reliance on representations outside the express terms\nof the contract. (/d.) Similarly, the breach of contract claims relating to prerequisites for\nadditional funding and alleged infirmities with the Petitioner\u2019s NOD were found futile and fell\noutside of any obligations imposed by the LFFA. (/d. at 52) The proposed affirmative defenses\nfared no better for similar reasons rooted in the contract language of the LFFA. (id. at 53-54)\nLastly, the Panel rejected the addition of a usury defense based on application of the Delaware\nusury statute because the Firm, as an LLP, is prohibited from asserting the defense as are the\nindividual Respondents who are deemed \u201cguarantors.\u201d (Id. at 54) The usury defense issue is\nfurther addressed in section IV(B), infra.\n\nLacking authority for vacating the Panel\u2019s decision on their Motion to Amend,\nRespondents nonetheless assert a related argument that they were denied a fair hearing. This\nargument erroneously assumes that the claims and defenses they sought to include by\namendment are in the case despite the Panel\u2019s ruling otherwise. Ignoring the heavy burden\n\nrequired of a party moving to vacate an award under section 10(a)(3) of the FAA, Respondents\u2019\narguments amount to no more than re-litigating the merits of claims and defenses which they\nunsuccessfully attempted to assert in the Arbitration Proceeding.\n\nSection (10)(a)(3) of the FAA \u201cpermits district courts to vacate arbitration awards \u2018where\nthe arbitrators were guilty of misconduct . . . in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material\nto the controversy.\u2019\u201d Caputo, 2022 WL 1449176, at *4. The Third Circuit cautioned that:\n\n[Section] 10(a)(3) cannot be read . . . to intend that every failure to receive relevant\n\nevidence constitutes misconduct which will require the vacatur of an arbitrator\u2019s award.\n\nVacatur under [section] 10(a)(3) is warranted only where the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to hear\n\nproffered testimony so affects the rights of a party that it may be said that he was\n\ndeprived of a fair hearing. Like the manifest disregard of law standard, this is an\nextremely deferential standard and typically results in confirmation of an arbitration\naward.\n\nId.\n\nRespondents have not identified any discovery, testimony, and evidence they did not\nhave an opportunity to present to the Panel. Instead, they assert vague arguments in their brief.\nThey contend, for example, that they should have had a \u201cmerits hearing\u201d concerning the\nPetitioner\u2019s intent in contract formation, the Petitioner\u2019s failure to demand payment for hourly\nfees prior to learning of the recovery from Space Data, Petitioner\u2019s lack of risk under the LFFA\nand whether it was fully secured. (D.I. 36 at 3) They, again, raise the usury defense but point to\nno specific evidence they could have introduced beyond the Panel\u2019s consideration of the terms of\nthe LFFA. (Jd. at 13-14)\n\nThe court is not persuaded that the Panel\u2019s decision to deny the Motion to Amend\ndeprived Respondents of a fair hearing. See Caputo, 2022 WL 1449176, at *5 (finding the\narbitration panel\u2019s decision to preclude evidence of petitioner\u2019s discharge from work without\n\ncause did not fall under section 10(a)(3) of the FAA because he was an at-will employee;\n\ntherefore, the evidence precluded had no bearing on the outcome).\n\n10\nIn addressing the central issue under the LFFA, the Panel found its terms unambiguous\nand ruled the amount awarded to Respondents in the fee dispute arbitration with its former client,\nSpace Data, is \u201cGross Revenue\u201d and was a \u201cRevenue Event\u201d which gives rise to a repayment\nobligation. (D.I. 8, Ex. 2 at 46) The ruling established Respondents\u2019 liability to Petitioner under\nthe LFFA. Respondents admit that they cannot relitigate this ruling. Thus, there is no point to\ntheir argument that they were denied a fair hearing on vague issues that would not undermine the\nPanel\u2019s ruling establishing their undisputed contractual liability to Petitioners. Therefore, the\ncourt recommends confirmation of the Final Award.\n\nB. Respondents Fail to Establish a Basis for Vacating the Final Award under\nSection 10(a)(4) of the FAA\n\nRespondents argue that the Final Award should be vacated because the Panel exceeded\nits authority in manifest disregard of law when it ignored the plain text of the LFFA and\nDelaware usury law in its finding that Hosie and Rice are \u201cguarantors.\u201d (D.I. 24 at 15-16, 20\u2014\n21; D.I. 33 at 2-3) Respondents first raised this argument unsuccessfully when they requested\nleave to add it as an affirmative defense and, again, in response to the adjudication of Petitioner\u2019s\ndamages. (See D.I. 25, Ex. 10; D.I. 31, Ex. 19)\n\nThe Panel twice explained the basis for its rejection of Respondents\u2019 usury defense. (D.I.\n8, Exs. 3-4) Interpretating sections 4 and 13 of the LFFA, the Panel found the Firm to be the\nprincipal borrower and Hosie and Rice were guarantors of payment. (/d., Ex. 3 at 54; id., Ex. 4\nat 59) Applying the Delaware usury statute, 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2306, the Panel held that a usury defense\nis not available to LLPs, like the Firm, and, therefore, the defense is not available to the\nindividual guarantors, Hosie and Rice, if the defense is not available to the principal borrower.\n\n(id)\n\n11\n\u201cfUjnder [section] 10(a)(4) of the FAA, a court cannot examine the merits of an\narbitrator\u2019s decision, correct factual errors, or overrule an award based on a mere disagreement\nwith the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a contract.\u201d Caputo, 2022 WL 1449176, at *4.\nRespondents\u2019 disagreement with the outcome is not a basis for vacating the Final Award. See\nMarkDutchCo 1 B.V. y, Zeta Interactive Corp., 411 F. Supp. 3d 316, 327-28 (D. Del. 2019)\n(finding the arbitrator did not exceed his authority under section 10(a)(4) because he interpreted\nspecific provisions in the contract).\n\nAt oral argument, Respondents cited for the first time this court\u2019s decision in QAD, Inc.\ny, Block & Co., arguing this case supports their position. No. 21-mc-370-MN, 2022 WL\n1211302 (D. Del. Apr. 25, 2022). Respondents\u2019 reliance is misplaced because the court\nconfirmed the arbitration award in QAD and recommends the same result in this case.\n\nRespondents correctly identify the legal standard under section 10(a)(4) of the FAA,\nwhich the court applied in QAD and applies here: \u201cThe question for the court in applying\n[section] 10(a)(4) is whether the arbitrator\u2019s award is \u2018irrational,\u2019 meaning that the award fails to\ndraw its essence from the agreement and cannot be rationally derived from the agreement, or that\nthe record contains no support for the arbitrator\u2019s determination.\u201d QAD, 2022 WL 1211302, at\n*2. In QAD, the court considered \u201cwhether the arbitrator exceeded his authority under [section]\n10(a)(4) in failing to enforce an unambiguous limited liability provision in the [contract] and\ndeclaring it unconscionable.\u201d 2022 WL 1211302, at *3. The court ruled that it could not\nrelitigate the merits of unconscionability, regardless of whether the arbitrator reached the correct\ndecision. Jd. at *3-4,\n\nJust as in OAD, this court cannot relitigate the Panel\u2019s determination that the individual\n\nRespondents are \u201cguarantors,\u201d regardless of whether the Panel reached the correct decision.\n\n12\nUnder section 10(a)(4), the court is not persuaded that the usury ruling is \u201cirrational\u201d or fails to\ndraw its essence from the LFFA or cannot be rationally derived from the LFFA or lacks support.\nSee id., at *2; see also Caputo, 2022 WL 1449176, at *4 (\u201cSimply put, we must enforce an\narbitration award if it is based on an arguable interpretation of the contract.\u201d). Therefore, the\ncourt recommends confirming the Final Award.\nVv.
