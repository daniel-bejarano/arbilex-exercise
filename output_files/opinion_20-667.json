(D.I. 390; D.L\n400) Because these motions are non-dispositive, my ruling is made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n636(b)(1)(A). The motions were fully briefed and supplemented, and all of the submissions have\n\nbeen carefully considered. (DI. 391; D.I. 392; DI. 401; D.I. 402; D.I. 405; D.I. 406; D.L. 407;\nD.L. 408) For the reasons discussed below, GOLO\u2019s motion and Goli\u2019s cross-motion are\nGRANTED-IN-PART.\n\nI. GOOD CAUSE EXISTS FOR EXTENDING THE FACT DISCOVERY\nDEADLINE TO JANUARY 31, 2023.\n\nThe parties\u2019 motions are GRANTED-IN-PART as they pertain to an extension of the fact\ndiscovery deadline to obtain discovery from certain third-party witnesses.! The fact discovery\ndeadline will be extended to January 31, 2023, or pending a ruling on the merits of any presently\npending motion concerning enforcement of the third-party subpoenas by a court having\njurisdiction over the deponent. To accommodate the extended fact discovery deadline, the\ndeadline for opening expert reports will also be extended to February 3, 2023. No further\nextensions of scheduling order deadlines are permitted without leave of court.\n\nApplications for amendments to the scheduling order are governed Rule 16(b)(4), which\nprovides that \u201c[a] schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d\nFed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). \u201cGood cause is present when the schedule cannot be met despite the\nmoving party\u2019s diligence.\u201d Meda Pharm. Inc. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., C.A. No. 15-785-LPS,\n2016 WL 6693113, at *1 (D. Del. Nov. 14, 2016).\n\nHere, good cause exists for an extension that will give both sides an opportunity to pursue\ndeposition subpoenas issued to third-party witnesses before the fact discovery deadline. With\nrespect to GOLO\u2019s witnesses, the parties agreed during today\u2019s oral argument that the deposition\nof Jennifer Lopez is scheduled to go forward on January 27, 2023, and Goli has no objection to\nGOLO pursuing the deposition of Treetop Industries, LLC f/k/a Canopy Industries LLC\n\n(\u201cCanopy\u201d) promptly. There appears to be no dispute that these depositions will be taken before\n\n1 The Southern District of Florida denied without prejudice GOLO\u2019s motion to enforce the\ndeposition subpoena of Alexander Rodriguez on January 12, 2023. (D.I. 407, Ex. A; D.I. 408)\n\n2\nJanuary 31, 2023. The extension of the fact discovery deadline to January 31 applies equally to\nGoli. At oral argument, the parties appeared to agree that Amber Myers is an employee of\nGOLO, and it is likely that arrangements can be made to take her deposition as a party witness\nby January 31, 2023.\n\nThe two remaining witnesses subpoenaed by GOLO, and one witness subpoenaed by\nGoli, are presently engaged in subpoena enforcement proceedings in other jurisdictions. Better\nNutritionals, LLC (\u201cBN\u201d) is engaged in proceedings in the Central District of California. (D.I.\n391, Ex. 5) The parties have represented that the Southern District of Florida compelled\nAlexander Rodriguez to produce documents and denied GOLO\u2019s deposition subpoena of Mr.\nRodriguez without prejudice to renew based on the results of the document production. (D.I.\n407; D.I. 408) And the record indicates that Goli\u2019s deposition subpoena of Dr. Terry Shirvani is\nthe subject of enforcement proceedings in the District of Nevada. (D.L 401, Ex. 5)\n\nThis court\u2019s extension of the fact discovery deadline to January 31, 2023 is not intended\nto prevent a court in another jurisdiction where enforcement proceedings are pending from\naddressing the merits of the deposition subpoenas.\n\nGoli also seeks the deposition of Dr. Robert Buynak. (D.I. 401, Ex. 9) There appears to\nbe no dispute that Dr. Buynak resides outside of this jurisdiction, and Goli has not yet\ncommenced enforcement proceedings to obtain compliance with the deposition subpoena it\nissued on October 15, 2022. (d.) Goli may pursue the deposition of Dr. Buynak to the extent\nthe deposition can be completed by January 31, 2023. Any extension beyond that date should be\ndiscussed by the parties in an attempt to resolve the issue prior to seeking leave of court for an\n\nextension of the deadline.\n\nLet the record be clear that these rulings are limited to extensions of time for completing\nthe depositions in issue, and they are not to be construed as rulings on the merits of any\nobjections to the depositions which have been or could be asserted by the deponents in their\nrespective jurisdictions.\n\nIl. THE PARTIES\u2019 REQUESTS TO EXPAND THE HOURS TO TAKE THE\nREMAINING DEPOSITIONS IS GRANTED-IN-PART.\n\nThe parties\u2019 motions for additional hours of deposition time are GRANTED-IN-PART.\nAt oral argument, the parties represented that GOLO has four hours of deposition time\nremaining, and Goli has ten hours of its deposition time remaining. The court finds that good\ncause exists to expand the number of deposition hours for each side as follows:\n\n\u00a2 GOLO may have three additional hours, in addition to the four hours remaining,\nto take the depositions of Ms. Lopez and Canopy.\n\ne This court allows additional time but defers to the Canadian court regarding any\ntime limit for GOLO\u2019s examination of Dr. Bitensky, and if no such limit is\nordered then a deposition of no more than seven (7) hours is permitted pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(d)(1), subject to the Canadian court\u2019s\nlimitations on the scope of the deposition, if any.\n\n\u00a9 Goli may have three additional deposition hours, and may also have an additional\nnumber of hours equivalent to the amount of time awarded to GOLO to take Dr.\nBitensky\u2019s deposition, beyond its remaining ten hours of deposition time.\n\ne To the extent courts having jurisdiction over the disputes regarding third party\ndepositions of BN, Mr. Rodriguez, and Dr. Shirvani allow such depositions to\n\nproceed, the parties shall meet and confer on the amount of additional time, if\nany, required to complete each deposition in an effort to resolve the matter prior\nto seeking leave of court.\nIll. GUIDANCE ON DEPOSITION CONDUCT\n\nGOLO has expressed concern that its remaining deposition time will be eroded by a lack\nof witness preparation and/or alleged improper conduct by the deponent and defending counsel\u2019s\noveruse of objections. The court has reviewed the exhibits which were provided as examples,\nincluding the selected video clips from defendant Michael Bitensky\u2019s deposition, and the court is\ncognizant of GOLO\u2019s concerns. (See, e.g., D.I. 391, Ex. 8, Deposition Transcript of Michael\nBitensky) Goli raises similar concerns about conduct occurring during the depositions of certain\nGOLO witnesses. (D.I. 401 at 14, citing Ex. 22 Deposition Transcript of Christopher Lundin)\nNeither party has affirmatively sought relief from the court for any alleged deposition\nmisconduct, and it is too late for the court to entertain such requests now.\n\nGoing forward, the court is prepared to address requests for relief within its jurisdiction\nfor alleged improper conduct by a deponent and/or counsel defending a deposition. Such relief\nmay include requiring a supplemental deposition of the witness along with shifting the costs\nassociated with the original and supplemental depositions. Depositions are court proceedings,\nand counsel defending a deposition may object only as permitted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2),\nwhich requires objections to \u201cbe stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive\nmanner,\u201d and permits an instruction not to answer \u201conly when necessary to preserve a privilege,\nto enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 30(c)(2).\n\nIn addition, counsel defending a deposition has an obligation to prepare the witness and\n\nprevent the deponent from impeding or frustrating a fair examination. The Delaware Supreme\n\nCourt provided cautionary advice to deponents and their counsel in In re Shorenstein Hays-\nNederlander Theatres LLC Appeals, 213 A.3d 39, 69-79 (Del. 2019), explaining that attorneys\n\u201chave a responsibility to intercede and not sit idly by as their client engages in abusive deposition\nmisconduct.\u201d This is sound advice in the view of this judicial officer.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, GOLO\u2019s motion to amend the scheduling order and Goli\u2019s\nmotion in the alternative are GRANTED-IN-PART. (D.I. 390; D.1. 400) A limited extension of\nthe fact discovery deadline to January 31, 2023, and an extension of the deadline for opening\nexpert reports to February 3, 2023, is appropriate for the parties to take the remaining third-party\ndepositions. The parties\u2019 requests for additional hours of deposition time are also GRANTED-\nIN-PART. Each side shall have an additional three hours of deposition time, plus additional\nhours equivalent to the amount of time awarded to GOLO to take Dr. Bitensky\u2019s deposition.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties shall promptly provide this Memorandum\nOrder and the Amended Scheduling Order to courts in which proceedings to enforce a subpoena\nare pending.\n\nThis Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Order. Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to four (4) pages each.\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nwww.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: January 13, 2023\n\n"}
