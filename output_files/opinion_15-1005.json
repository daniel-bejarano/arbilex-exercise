Andrews", "date": "03-03-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJOANE. QUINN, Individually and as \nPersonal Representative of the Estate of \nJAMES ALBERT QUINN, Deceased , et al., \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nAVCO CORPORATION, et al., \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 15-1005-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nBefore me is Plaintiffs ' Supplemental Authority in Support of Their Motion for \nReargument of Defendant Continental Motors, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment. (D.I. \n277). The motion is fully briefed. (D.I. 277,278,279). For the reasons stated below, \nPlaintiffs ' motion is DENIED . \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis action arises out of an airplane crash that occurred on November 5, 2013. (D.I. \n222, Ex. A-1 at 1). Following oral argument , I concluded that the General Aviation \nRevitalization Act (GARA), Pub. L. No. 103-298, 108 Stat. 1552 (codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40101 \nnote), barred Plaintiffs ' claims against Continental for its 2002 rebuild of the dual magneto. \n(D.I. 268 at 15-16). A full description of the relevant facts can be found in the Court's \nMemorandum Opinion granting summary judgment to Continental. (D.I. 268). \n1 Plaintiffs moved for reargument on the grounds that Continental is not entitled to the \nprotections of GARA for its role as the rebuilder and seller of the dual magneto. (D.I. 271). I \ngranted reargument on three issues: (1) whether the phrase \"capacity as a manufacturer \" includes \na manufacturer acting as a rebuilder or a seller; (2) the status of Plaintiffs' claims against \nContinental in its capacity as a rebuilder ; and (3) the status of Plaintiffs ' claims against \nContinental in its capacity as a seller. (D.I. 274 at 5). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.\" FED. \nR. CIV. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. \nLamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242,248 (1986)). \"(A] dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence \nis sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view \nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable \ninferences in that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the \nnon-moving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with \nrespect to which it has the burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \noflaw. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 4 77 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nGARA's 18-year statute ofrepose applies to claims \"brought against the manufacturer of \nthe aircraft or the manufacturer of any new component , system, subassembly , or other part of the \n2 aircraft, in its capacity as a manufacturer .... \" GARA\u00a7 2(a). Plaintiffs argue that the phrase \n\"capacity as a manufacturer\" does not include rebuilders or sellers. (D.I. 277 at 4-9). Thus, \nPlaintiffs contend that Continental was not acting in its capacity as a manufacturer when it \nrebuilt and sold the magneto in 2002 and GARA's protections do not apply. (Id.). \nPlaintiffs first argue that since GARA contains no mention of \"rebuilders \" or \"sellers,\" \nCongress did not intend to shield them from liability. (Id. at 5). They also rely on a legislative \nreport which clarifies the meaning of GARA\u00a7 2(a). The report provides: \nThe [\"in its capacity as a manufacturer \"] limitation is intended to insure that parties \nwho happen to be manufacturers of an aircraft or a component part are not \nimmunized from liability they may be subject to in some other capacity. For \nexample, in the event a party who happened to be a manufacturer committed some \nnegligent act as a mechanic of an aircraft or as a pilot, and such act was a proximate \ncause of an accident, the victims would not be barred from bringing a civil suit for \ndamages against that party in its capacity as a mechanic. \nH.R. REP. 103-525(II). Plaintiffs argue, \"Certainly , this language demonstrates that Congress \nspecifically contemplated manufacturers performing maintenance services, such as rebuilding a \nproduct, and determined that manufacturers who are not acting like manufacturers should not be \nafforded GARA protection. \" (D.I. 277 at 6). \nPlaintiffs contend that rebuilding a magneto is an unprotected maintenance procedure. \n(Id.). Plaintiffs reason that a manufacturer is authorized to rebuild an aircraft part under 14 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 43.3, which applies to the role of maintenance personnel. (Id.). They assert that 14 \nC.F.R. pt. 21 provides the regulations that apply to manufacturers \"in their capacity as \nmanufacturers. \" (Id.). Thus, they argue that since rebuilding a magneto is authorized under \npart 43 instead of part 21, it is a maintenance procedure performed in the manufacturer 's \ncapacity as a mechanic , not as a manufacturer. (Id.). \n3 I do not think that the structure of the FAA regulations shows that rebuilding a magneto \nis a maintenance procedure performed by a manufacturer in its capacity as a mechanic rather \nthan in its capacity as a manufacturer. Although rebuilt parts are governed under part 43 rather \nthan part 21, they must meet the same tolerances and limits as new parts. See 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n43.2(b) (\"No person may describe in any required maintenance entry or form an aircraft ... or \ncomponent part as being rebuilt unless it has been disassembled , cleaned, inspected , repaired as \nnecessary , reassembled , and tested to the same tolerances and limits as a new item, using either \nnew parts or used parts that either conform to new part tolerances and limits or to approved \noversized or undersized dimensions. \"). This is different than the standards required for general \nmaintenance . For example, an overhauled part1 must be \"tested in accordance with approved \nstandards and technical data.\" Id. \u00a7 43.2(a); see also id. \u00a7 43.13 (\"Each person performing \nmaintenance , alteratio~ , or preventive maintenance on an aircraft, engine, propeller , or appliance \nshall use the methods, techniques , and practices prescribed in the current manufacturer's \nmaintenance manual or Instructions for Continued Airworthiness prepared by its manufacturer , \nor other methods, techniques , and practices acceptable to the Administrator .... \"). \nFurther, only a manufacturer can rebuild an aircraft part. Id. \u00a7 43.30). \"Unlike with \nrepairs or overhauls , the manufacturer itself controls when a part is rebuilt.\" (D.I. 268 at 12). \nIn the original opinion granting summary judgment , I concluded that Continental qualifies as a \nmanufacturer under GARA because only a manufacturer can rebuild an aircraft per FAA \n1 One court has stated that an \"overhauled\" part is one that \"is removed for maintenance and \nreturned to the aircraft. \" Robinson v. Hartzell Propeller Inc., 326 F. Supp. 2d 631,663 (E.D. \nPa. 2004). \n4 regulations.2 (D.I. 268 at 11-12). It makes no sense to say that Continental is a \n\"manufacturer\" under GARA because it rebuilt the magneto but then conclude that Continental \nwas not acting \"in its capacity as a manufacturer \" when it rebuilt the magneto. If only a \nmanufacturer can rebuild an aircraft part, then a manufacturer who rebuilds an aircraft part is \nnecessarily acting in its capacity as a manufacturer.3 \nThe parties do not cite-and the Court did not find-any cases addressing whether the \nphrase \"capacity as a manufacturer\" includes rebuilders. Continental directs the Court to a line \nof cases holding that a manufacturer is acting in its capacity as a manufacturer when it publishes \nmaintenance manuals. Crouch v. Honeywell Int'!, Inc., 720 F.3d 333, 339-41 (6th Cir. 2013); \nEst. ofGrochowske v. Romey, 813 N.W.2d 687, 695-97 (Wis. Ct. App. 2012); Mason v. \nSchweizer Aircraft Corp., 653 N.W.2d 543, 549-52 (Iowa 2002); Burroughs v. Precision \nAirmotive Corp., 93 Cal. Rptr. 2d 124, 133-39 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000). These holdings are based \non the fact that federal regulations require manufacturers to publish these manuals. See Crouch, \n720 F.3d at 340. Although a manufacturer is not required by law to rebuild an aircraft part, I do \nfind the \"maintenance manual\" line of cases instructive . A manufacturer that rebuilds an \naircraft part-just like a manufacturer that publishes a maintenance manual-is engaging in \nconduct that is exclusively reserved to aviation manufacturers by federal regulations. \nThus, I conclude that a manufacturer is acting \"in its capacity as a manufacturer\" under \nGARA when it rebuilds an aircraft part. Because Continental was acting in its capacity as a \n2 Plaintiffs do not appear to challenge this finding. (See D.I. 277 at 5). \n3 The fact that only manufacturers can rebuild aircraft parts also renders Plaintiffs ' statutory \nlanguage argument unpersuasive. (See D.I. 277 at 5). If only manufacturers can rebuild \naircraft parts, then it was unnecessary for Congress to separately reference \"re builders\" in the \nstatute. All \"rebuilders \" are \"manufacturers. \" \n5 manufacturer when it rebuilt and sold4 the magneto in 2002, GARA applies. Plaintiffs' new \nargument thus does not change my original holding that Plaintiffs' negligence claims against \nContinental are barred under GARA. (D.I. 268 at 15-16). I therefore reaffirm my grant of \nContinental 's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' negligence claims in Count Five of \nthe Complaint. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will issue. \nEntered this _2 day of March, 2022. \n4 Plaintiffs do not make any separate arguments that Continental 's sale of the rebuilt magneto \nwas not in its capacity as a manufacturer. But Plaintiffs do cite Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank \nNw., NA. Tr., 2011 WL 6257148 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 14, 2011). In Garcia, the airplane \nmanufacturer argued that it was protected from liability under GARA for the sale of a \nreplacement part which allegedly caused the accident. Id at *3. The court rejected this \nargument, stating, \"Neither the text of GARA nor the Judiciary Committee Notes make mention \nof a special exception for airplane manufacturers who then sell replacement parts .... GARA \ndoes not prohibit Plaintiff from bringing a strict liability action against Defendant for its role as a \nseller of a product that allegedly malfunctioned and caused injury.\" Id In Garcia, however, it \nwas undisputed that the airplane manufacturer did not manufacture the replacement part that \ncaused the accident. It merely sold the part. Here, Continental rebuilt and sold the magneto. \nAs I concluded above, Plaintiffs' claims against Continental for the rebuild of the magneto are \nbarred under GARA. If Plaintiffs were allowed to maintain a suit for Continental 's sale of the \nrebuilt magneto, this would pave the way for plaintiffs to easily recharacterize their claims to \navoid GARA. See Grochowske , 813 N.W.2d at 700 (\"Allowing the plaintiffs to use artful \npleadings to bypass GARA's protections and sue [the manufacturer] for actions it took in its \ncapacity as a manufacturer outside of the repose period would undermine the legislative intent \nbehind the statute ofrepose.\"). For example, plaintiffs could avoid GARA by characterizing a \ndesign defect claim as a claim that a manufacturer negligently sold a defective part. (See D.I. \n278 at 6--7). Thus, GARA applies to both Continental 's rebuild and sale of the magneto. \n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJOANE.
