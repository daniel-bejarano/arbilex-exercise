For the reasons set forth herein, the Court will affirm  the Order . \nI. BACKGROUND \n \nA. The APA and the Sale Order  \nOn July 29, 2010, Mr. Weinstein  entered into an employment a greement (AA831 -847) \n(\u201cthe Employment Agreement\u201d) with TWC pursuant to which he was granted, in addition to his \nbase salary, an interest in certain net revenues received by the Debtors from some of the films that \nMr. Weinstein  produced (\u201c the Participation Interest\u201d)  (id. \u00a7 4(b)) .  The Employment Agreement  \nexpired by its own terms on December 31, 2015.  (Id. \u00a7 1).  The Participation Interest survived \nexpiration of the Employment Agreement.  ( Id. \u00a7 21).2 \nOn March 19, 2018, TWC and certain affiliates ( \u201cthe Debtors\u201d) filed voluntary petitions \nfor relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  That same day, the Debtors filed a motion \n \n1  The docket of the Chapt er 11 cases, captioned In re The Weinstein Company Holdings \nLLC, No. 18- 10601 (MFW)  (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \u201cB.D.I. __.\u201d  The Appendix \n(D.I. 8) filed in support of Spyglass\u2019s opening brief is cited herein as \u201cAA __.\u201d \n \n2  Spyglass argues that the Participation Interest \u201cmay not have survived the termination\u201d and \nthe Employment Agreement does not contain \u201cthe customary features of a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as required under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d (D.I. 7 at 9, n15) .  This  contention was not  raised below and will not be considered now.  \nSee Montr ose Medical Group, 243 F.3d 773, 783 (3d Cir. 2001)  (declining to consider \nargument raised for the first time at oral argument) . 2 seeking approval of a sale of substantially all of their assets to Spyglass pursuant to an Asset \nPurchase Agreement ( as amended and modified, \u201c the APA\u201d)  (AA580 -680).  On May 9, 2018, the \nBankruptcy Court entered the Sale Order approving the Sale of \u201cPurchased A ssets\u201d  (as defined in \nthe APA) to Spyglass under \u00a7 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and the assumption and assignment of \ncertain contracts under \u00a7  365 of the Bankruptcy Code .  (AA353 -576).  The Sale Order provides, \namong other things, that : \n\u201cThe transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser  . . . will vest the \nPurchaser with all right, title, and interest of the Sellers  to the  Purchased \nAssets free and clear of all claims, liens  . . . Excluded Liabilities (as defined \nin the APA  . . .) . . ., interests, rights and encumbrances ( other than \nPermitted Liens  and Assumed Liabilities)  . . .\u201d (Sale Order \u00b6 AA , AA362-\n363) (emphasis added) ; \n \n\u201cNotwithstanding anything set forth herein or in the APA and notwithstanding the inclusion of any Contract or Lease in the Contract Notice or the Assumed Contract Schedule, no thing in this Order or the \nAPA shall be deemed to otherwise alter, modify, extend or enhance the Debtors\u2019 rights, title or interest to or under any Purchased Asset  or to grant \nthe Purchaser any rights, title or interest in or under any property (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any property that is identified as a Purchased \nAsset) that is not property of the Debtors\u2019 estates.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 LL, AA368)  \n(emphasis added) ; \n \u201cPursuant to Bankruptcy Code sections 105(a) and 363(f), the Purchased \nAssets shall be sold free and clear of all Claims  (other than Permitted Liens  \nand Assumed Liabilities, each as defined in the A PA . . .\u201d .  (Id. \u00b6 12, AA376 ) \n(emphasis added) ; and  \n \u201cTo the extent there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Order and the terms of the APA, the terms of this Order shall govern .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 49, \nAA39 4) (emphasis added) . \n The Sale Order further provided that t he Bankruptcy Court retained \u201cjurisdiction to, among other \nthings, interpret, implement, and enforce the terms and provisions of this Order and the APA . . . \nand to adjudicate, if necessary, any and all disputes concerning or relating in any way to the Sale.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 51 , AA395 ; id. \u00b6 66, AA400 ).  The Sale closed on July 13, 2018.  ( AA810- 811).  \n  3 B. The Motion to Enforce  \nOn June 16, 2021, Mr. Weinstein  filed the Motion to Enforce, seeking a determination that \nhe was entitled to payment from Spyglass of his Participation Interest in the film Sc ream 4  (\u201cthe \nFilm\u201d), which was one of the \u201cPurchased A ssets\u201d sold to Spyglass under the APA.  ( AA812 -830).  \nMr. Weinstein argued that because he had a 1.875% Participation interest in the Film, the Debtors \ndid not own 100% of the Film and could only sell what they owned to Spyglass.  Mr. Weinstein argued that his interpretation is confirmed by \u00a7 3.10(a) of the APA in which the Debtors represented that they \u201cowned all right, title, and interest in and to\u201d the Film \u201cfree and clear of all liens (other th an Permitted Liens).\u201d  (APA \u00a7 3.10(a) , AA598 -599) .  Mr. Weinstein further asserted  \nthat under \u00a7\u00a7 2.3 and 2.4(j) of the APA, the Purchaser, Lantern (now known as Spyglass), had assumed all liabilities for \u201cParticipations\u201d for any period after the Closing Da te for each Covered \nTitle sold to it, including the Film.  Section 2.3 of the APA provides that Spyglass assumed all liabilities arising from operation of the Purchased Assets ( Scream 4  is a Purchased Asset) (APA \n\u00a7 2.3, AA587).  Section 2.4(j) of the APA provides that any Participation that arose for any period \nprior to the Closing Date is an Excluded Asset.  (APA \u00a7 2.4(j) , AA58 8).  The Disclosure Schedule \nspecifically listed Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Participation Interest in the Film as currently owed by the Debtors.  (AA1755).  Mr. Weinstein further provided evidence that the revenues earned on that \nfilm had recently exceeded the threshold for payment of that interest.  (Motion to Enforce Ex. 7, AA1862-1864).   \nSpyglass opposed the Motion to Enforce.  (B.D.I. 3387).  Spyglass argued that, under the  \nunambiguous terms of the APA, Spyglass purchased substantially all of the assets of the Debtors  \n\u201cfree and clear,\u201d subject to the Assumed Liabilities and Permitted Liens, but that Spyglass specifically negotiated to exclude certain  Liabilities so that it was assuming only post- Closing \nParticipations associated with Purchased Assets owed to non -Affili ates.  Spyglass point ed to 4 section 2.4(b) of the APA, which states that \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision in this \nAgreement or any other writing to the contrary\u201d Spyglass does not assume \u201cany amounts due to \nAffiliates of any Seller Party, including any declared dividends or distributions.\u201d  (APA \u00a7 2.4(b) , \nAA588).  Spyglass further relied on section 2.4(f) which excludes from liabilities it assumed under \nthe APA \u201call Liabilities arising under any Contract that is not an Assigned Contract.\u201d  (APA \n\u00a7 2.4(f), AA588 ).  There was no dispute that Mr. Weinstein  is an Affiliate of the Debtors as that \nterm is defined in the APA and  no dispute  that his Employment Agreement was not assumed and \nassigned to Spyglass.  Spyglass contended that the Sale Order did not elimi nate Mr. Weinstein\u2019s  \nclaim, but that this claim remained the estates\u2019  obligation to pay. \nMr. Weinstein argued that Spyglass\u2019 interpretation wa s contradicted by numerous sections \nof the APA, including \u00a7 2.3 in which Spyglass assumed  \u201call liabilities arising from operation of \nthe Purchased Assets . . . .\u201d  (AA587).  Mr. Weinstein  argued that the Film is a Purchased Asset \nand the Participation Righ ts claimed by him arise from the operation  (i.e., distribution) of the Film.  \nMr. Weinstein  further contended that \u00a7 2.4(j) supported his  interpretation of the APA because it \nprovided that only pre -closing Participation Interest payments were Excluded Liabilities, which \nmeant that post -closing Participation payments are not Excluded Liabilities.   Spyglass argued, \nhowever, that \u00a7 2.4(b)  of the APA  is the more specific provision as to Mr. Weinstein  and thus has \nprecedence over the more general pr ovisions of \u00a7\u00a7  2.1, 2.3 and 3.10 of the APA , which related to \nthe Participation Interests held by numerous parties.  The  Liquidating Trust for the Debtors\u2019 estates \nalso disputed Spyglass\u2019 interpretation, arguing it was not reasonable to conclude that the D ebtors \nsold the Film (and therefore, no longer owned it or the revenues it would generate in the future) \nbut that the estate s would be required to pay any claim for future revenues realized by that Film.   \n  5 C. The Memorandum Opinion and Order  \nThe parties agr eed that the APA is unambiguous and that extrinsic evidence was, therefore, \nnot required.  Following oral argument on August 5, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a bench \nruling, rejecting Spyglass\u2019 suggested interpretation and granting the Motion to Enforce .  (AA2056-\n2088 at AA2085-2087) .  The Order was entered on August 9, 2021 and, on August 12, 2021, the \nBankruptcy Court issued its Memorandum Opinion in s upport of the bench  ruling.  (AA2089 -\n2100).  The Bankruptcy Court agreed with Sp yglass\u2019 premise that the specific provisions of a \ncontract control more general ones.  It disagreed, however, with Spyglass\u2019 conclusion that \u00a7 2.4(b) \nwas the more specific provision.  The Bankruptcy Court found that \u00a7 2.4(b) was  \u201cvery broad and \nstates that  any liability owed to any Affiliate of the Debtors was an Excluded Liability that \nSpyglass was not  assuming.  (Mem. Op. at 7- 8 (emphasis in original) ).  The Bankruptcy Court \nconcluded that \u201cthe more specific provisions of the APA (and the Sale Order) were those that \nprovided that [Mr. Weinstein]\u2019s  Participation Interest was preserved.\u201d  ( Id. at 8).   \nOn August 9, 2021, Spyglass filed its Notice of Appeal  from the Order.  (D.I. 1).  The \nappeal is fully briefed.  (D.I. 7, 8, 11, 12).  The Court did not hear oral argument because the facts \nand legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument. \nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nThe Order enforcing the Sale Order is final and the Court has jurisdiction over this  appeal \npursuant to  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1).   \nMr. Weinstein argues that this Court should review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Order and \nMemorandum Opinion, which interpreted and enforce d its own Sale Order,  for abuse of discretion, \nas opposed to de novo .  (D.I. 11 at 1-2 ).  Mr. Weinstein relies on the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in In \nre Shenango Group Inc . for the proposition that a \u201cbankruptcy court\u2019s review of its own order 6 ought to be subject to review for an abuse of discretion.\u201d   501 F.3d 338, 346 (3d Cir. 2007).  \nSpyglass disagrees on the basis  that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision is an interpretation of the \nAPA and contract interpretation, a question of law that is reviewed  de novo .  (D.I. 12 at 3- 4).   \nAs Spyglass correctly points out, i n Shenango, the Third Circuit reviewed whether a \nconfirmed plan of reorganization obligated the reorganized debtor to fully fund a pension plan.  \nThe Third Circuit explained that it had yet to adopt a standard for reviewing a bankruptcy court\u2019s \ninterpretation of its o wn order, so it analyzed non- binding precedent from other circuits.  The Third \nCircuit concluded: \nAs the Eleventh Circuit pointed out in In re Optical Technologies , simply \nbecause a bankruptcy court \u2019s interpretation of its order is entitled to \ndeference does not \u201cinsulate all aspects of the bankruptcy court \u2019s opinion \nfrom anything more searching than abuse of discretion review. The \nrationale for deferring to a court \u2019s interpretation of  its own order does not \nextend to its analysis of broad legal principles . . . .\u201d \n \nWe agree with the majority view that a bankruptcy court \u2019s interpretation of \nits own order ought to be subject to review for an abuse of discretion.  This \ndeferential standard should not apply, of course, if the issue being reviewed presents only a question of law.   This bifurcated approach both \nensures the appropriate role of this Court to review de novo pure questions \nof law, and also accords great weight to the Bankruptcy Court \u2019s \nconstruction of an order with which it is f amiliar by virtue of its direct \ninvolvement in the proceedings.  Thus, we conclude that the initial inquiry \nof whether Shenango\u2019 s Reorganization Plan is ambiguous is subject to de \nnovo review.   If the Plan is ambiguous, we will defer to the Bankruptcy \nCourt\u2019s interpretation unless it is unreasonable under the circumstances. \n \nId. at 346 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).  Thus, the initial inquiry of whether the \nAPA and Sale Order are ambiguous is subject to de novo review.    \nIII. PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS  \nSpyglass argues that Mr. Weinstein is barred from arguing that his post -closing \nParticipation Interests are Permitted Liens  becau se he did not object to the Sale Order .  (D.I. 7 at \n27).  Spyglass\u2019 primary argument  on appeal , however, turns on  \u00a7 2.4(b) of the APA, which 7 Spyglass contends  excluded Mr. Weinstein from receiving his post -closing Participation Interest \nfrom the Film.  ( See id . at 17-24).  That section provides, in relevant part: \nSection 2.4.  Excluded Liabilities .  Notwithstanding any provision \nin this Agreement or any other writing to the contrary  . . . Buyer is \nassuming only the Assumed Liabilities  and is not assuming any other \nLiability of any Seller Party of whatever nature, whether presently in \nexistence or arising hereafter.  All such other Liabilities shall be retained by and remain Liabilities of the Seller Parties  (all such Liabilities not be ing \nassumed being herein referred to as the \u201cExcluded Liabilities\u201d), including , \nwithout limitation:    \n . . .   \n(b) any amounts due to Affiliates of any Seller Party , including any \ndeclared dividends or distributions.  \n(APA \u00a7 2.4(b) (emphasis added ).  There is no dispute that \u201c Affiliate s\u201d includes Mr. Weinstein , \nand, according to Spyglass, the language used  indicates the parties\u2019 clear intent  that this provision \nshould override all others.  ( D.I. 7  at 19-24; D.I. 12 at 5-8).  Spyglass argues that  the APA  is \nunambiguous but the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s interpretation created ambiguity.  (D.I. 12 at 11).  If the \nCourt finds the APA to be ambiguous, Spyglass urges the Court to  review the extrinsic evidence \npropounded or remand the matter to the Bankruptcy Court  for consideration thereof.  ( Id. at 28-\n30).  Conversely, Mr. Weinstein argues that he could not have  waived his interpretation of the \nAPA, and that  Spyglass\u2019 interpretation of the APA and Sale Order would violate principles of \ncontract interpretation and make the APA internally inconsistent, illogical, and perhaps illegal.  \n(See D.I. 11 at 10-19). \nIV. ANALYSIS  \nThe Bankruptcy Court correctly identified  the applicable principles of contract \ninterpretation.  (Mem. Op. at 4).  Where a written contract is clear and unambiguous, the Court need not look beyond its four corners.  See, e.g., Bathla v. 913 Mkt., LLC , 200 A.3d 754, 759\u201360 \n(Del. 2018).  In interpreting a written contract, the Court should endeavor to give effect to each 8 provision and to avoid concluding that the contract is internally inconsistent or contradictory.  See, \ne.g., Kuhn Const., Inc. v. Diamond State Port Corp., 990 A.2d 393, 396-97 (Del. 2010) (\u201cWe will \nread a contract as a whole and we will give each provision and term effect, so as not to render any part of the contract mere surplusage.\u201d); Axis Reinsurance Co. v. HLTH Corp., 993 A.2d 1057, 1063 (Del. 2010) (\u201c[A] court will not adopt [an] interpretation that leads to unreasonable results, \nbut instead will adopt [a] construction that is reasonable and that harmonizes the affected contract provisions.\u201d).  The Bankruptcy Court also cited the  proposition that a court should not interpret a \ncontract in such a way as to be contrary to law.  (Mem. Op. at 9).  \nA.  The APA Is Not A mbiguous \nThe Court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court and the parties that the APA is not ambiguous.  \n(See D.I. 7 at 1, 3, 17; D.I. 11 at 12, 16; D.I. 12 at 8).  Section 2.1 of the APA provides that Spyglass \npurchased the Debtors\u2019 assets free and c lear of all liens except for \u201cPermitted Liens.\u201d  (APA \u00a7 2.1 , \nAA586 -587).  Permitted Liens includes Participations.  (APA Ex. A-10, AA646).  Participations \nmeans with respect to any Covered Title ( Scream 4 ) any contractually required payment to a third \nparty involved in the production of the film (such as Mr. Weinstein as producer).  ( Id.).  Schedule \n3.10(a) specificall y identifies Mr. Weinstein as being entitled to Participations in Scream 4 .  \n(AA1755).  Section 2.3 of the APA provides that Lantern (Spyglass) assumed all liabilities arising from operation of the Purchased Assets ( Scream 4  is a Purchased Asset and Participations would \nonly arise from exploitation of the film) (APA \u00a7 2.3, AA587).  Section 2.4(j) of the APA provides that Participations that arose for any period prior to the Closing Date are an Excluded Asset.  (APA \n\u00a7 2.4(j ), AA587).  There is no analog provision excluding Participations that arise after the Closing \nDate.  Nor could there be based upon the above provisions.  The Court agrees with the Bankruptcy \nCourt that all the above provisions work together and support the conclusion that Spyglass 9 acquired the Film subject to Permitted Liens, and Mr. Weinstein is entitled to  payment of  his \nParticipation  Interest  from Spyglass.  (Mem. Op. at 10).    \nB. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Interpretation Is Reasonable and Harmonizes All  \nProvisions of the APA   \n \n1. Specific Provision s of the APA Control More General Provisions \n \nSpyglass argues that \u00a7 2.4\u2019s  prefatory language  \u2013 \u201cNotwithstanding any provision in this \nAgreement or any other writing to the contrary . . .\u201d \u2013 expresses the parties\u2019 intent that this language \nwould take precedence over any language elsewhere in the APA to the contrary.  ( See D.I. 7 at \n20).  According to Spyglass, although the Bankruptcy Court, \u201crecognized that specific provisions \nof a contract control more general term s,\u201d the Bankruptcy Court  \u201cthen proceeded to misapply the \nrule.\u201d  (Id. at 23) .  Spyglass argues that \u201c[t]he Bankruptcy Court did not reference the \n\u2018notwithstanding\u2019 preamble to the Excluded Liabilities section or explain how or why the \nPermitted Lien definition could be more specific in light of that preamble.\u201d  ( Id.). \nTo the contrary, the Memorandum Opinion includes a detailed analysis of the APA  which \nsupports the Bankruptcy Court \u2019s disagree ment with Spyglass\u2019 contention that \u00a7 2.4(b)  of the APA \nis the more  specific provision.  As the Bankruptcy Court explained , \u00a7 2.4(b) is \u201cvery broad.\u201d  \n(Mem. Op. at 7).  Indeed, as the Bankruptcy Court observed, that provision \u201c states that any  liability \nowed to any  Affiliate of the Debtors was an Excluded Liability that Spyglass was not assuming.\u201d  \n(Id. (quoting APA \u00a7 2.4(b))  (emphasis in original) ).  In contrast, the more specific provisions of \nthe APA (and the Sale Order) were those expressly providing that Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Participation \nInterest was preserved.  (Mem. Op. at 8).   \nThe Court agrees.  Section 2.1 of the APA and paragraph 12 of the Sale Order provide that \nall assets owned by the Debtors are sold free and clear of all interests except for a narrow categ ory \nof interests  \u2013 Permitted Liens.  ( Sale Order  \u00b6 12, AA376; APA \u00a7 2.1, AA586 -587).  Permitted 10 Liens are defined in the APA to include Participations, which are defined to include  \u201ccontractually \nrequired amounts  . . . payable to or on behalf of any third party involved in the development and/ or \nproduction\u201d of any Film sold to Spyglass.  ( APA Ex. A  (Definitions) , AA646).  The  schedule to \nsection 3.10(a) of the APA specifically identifies Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Participation Interest in the Film \nas a Permitted Lien.  ( APA  \u00a7 3.10(a) , AA598 -599; Schedule 3.10(a) , AA1755 ).  The Bankruptcy \nCourt correctly concluded that the general provision that stated that Spyglass was not assuming \nany liabilities to Affiliates did not take precedence over  the specific provisions of the APA (and \nthe Sale Order) that sold the Film to Spyglass free and clear of all liens, c laims, and interests, \nexcept Mr. Weinstein\u2019s  Participation Interest in that Film.   \nSpyglass argues that Courts regularly interpret language similar to \u201cNotwithstanding \nanything herein to the contrary\u201d as controlling in the face of contrary provisions.  (D .I. 7 at 20 \nn.20).  \u201c In other words, notwithstanding the fact that Permitted Liens is defined to include \nParticipations elsewhere in the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Excluded Liabilities set forth in Section 2.4 control .\u201d  (Id. at 20).  Indeed such langua ge is often deemed controlling.  See, e.g., \nCisneros v. Alpine Ridge Grp., 508 U.S. 10, 18 (1993) ( in construing statutes, \u201c[T]he u se of such \na \u2018notwithstanding\u2019 clause clearly signals the drafter\u2019s intention that the provisions of the \u2018notwithstanding\u2019  section override conflicting provisions of any other section.\u201d); Cipla Ltd. v. \nAmgen Inc ., 386 F. Supp. 3d 386, 397 (D. Del.), aff\u2019d sub nom. Cipla Ltd. v. Amgen Inc ., 778 F. \nApp\u2019x 135 (3d Cir. 2019) (finding that the \u201cclear and unambiguous meaning of this phrase is that \nregardless of whatever else one might find in any other provision or sentence of the [Agreement], the consequences of [this] sentence . . . must be enforced.\u201d).  In this case, however,  the \n\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d  clause at issue is a  very broad provision, stand ing in contrast to  specific \nprovisions  preserving Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Participation Interest , and adopting such an interpretation  \nof the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause would lead to unreasonable results .  Axis Reinsurance Co ., 11 993 A.2d at 1063.  Such an interpretation  would relieve Spyglass of the obligation to pay \nMr. Weinstein for his Participation Interest in the Film, despite the fact that the APA and Sale \nOrder specifically provided that the sale of the Film was subject to  that Participation Interest.  \n(See Sale Order \u00b6 12, AA376; APA \u00a7 2.1, AA 586-587; id. \u00b6 3.10(a), AA598-599; id. Schedule \n3.10(a), AA1755 ).  \n2. The Memorandum Opinion H armonizes the  Provisions of the APA \nAlthough Spyglass acknowledges that a profit participant\u2019s \u201c. . . payment is entirely \ncontingent upon the success of the film and the revenue it generates,\u201d Spyglass asserts  that it does \nnot owe any post- closing Participation  Interest payment to Mr. Weinstein under the APA.  ( D.I. 7  \nat 15 -16).  Spyglass does not argue that the Participation Interest disappeared .  (See id. at 26 \n(\u201cImportantly, Spyglass is not arguing that Robert Weinstein\u2019s Participation interest in Scream 4  \nwas eliminated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.\u201d)).   Rather, Spyglass claim s that the Liquidating  \nTrust, which  no longer owns the Film and is not entitled to any revenue from the Film, must make \nthe calculations and pay Mr. Weinstein\u2019s  Participation Interest based upon accountings that  the \nLiquidating Trust has  no way to access .  The Liquidating Trust disagree d with Spyglass\u2019 \ncontention.  ( See 8/5/21 Tr. at AA2082-2083; Mem. Op. at  6).  \nIt makes little economic sense to construe  the APA as allowing  Spyglass to keep 100% of \nthe future revenue of the Film, while requiring Liquidating Trust, which will receive no such \nrevenue, to pay Mr. Weinstein 1.875% of a continuing amount of which the Liquidating Trust \ncould not be aware.  The Bankruptcy Court recognized  that such a construction of the APA would \nbe illogical and unreasonable , and thus adopted a construction that \u201c harmonize[s] the affected \nprovisions\u201d of the  APA.  Axis Reinsurance Co ., 993 A.2d at 1063.  Under the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \nreasonable interpretation, if Spyglass chooses to exploit the Film and there is a revenue stream, 12 Spyglass will collect that money and will be able to calculate Mr. Weinstein\u2019s 1.875% \nParticipation Interest and make any required payments  to him .   \nThe Bankruptcy Court noted that Spyglass\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7  2.4(b) of the APA would \nmake that provision inconsistent with numerous other terms of the APA  \u2013 particularly \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, \n2.4(j), and 3.10(a)  \u2013 as well as  inconsistent with the Sale Order.  (See Mem. Op. at 10).  Instead, \nthe Bankruptcy Court adopted an internally consistent interpretation: that \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.3, 2.4(j), and \n3.10(a) of the APA and paragraph 12 of the Sale Order were the more specific provisions dealing \nwith what interests in the assets sold  to Spyglass were preserved , and that \u00a7 2.4(b) was the more \ngeneral provision, stating that Spyglass was not assuming liabilities to Affiliates of the Debtors.    \nSpyglass argues that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s  interpretation \u201crenders certain other \nprovisions of the APA meaningless.\u201d  (D.I. 7 at 1- 2, 16).  According to Spyglass, the Bankruptcy \nCourt\u2019s holding that a Participation Interest  is a Permitted Lien that cannot be contractually \nexcluded ignores the preamble to \u00a7 2.4, which carves out the Excluded Liabi lities \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or any other writing to the contrary.\u201d  As noted \nabove, this broad provision yields  to the specific provision that Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Participation \nInterest is a Permitted Lien.  T he Bankruptcy Court\u2019s holding also renders \u00a7 2.4(j)  meaningless , \nSpyglass argues, because it  specifically excludes pre- Closing Participations : \u201cIf all Participations \nare Permitted Liens, \u201d \u201cwhy would the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement expressly designate \npre-Closing Participations as Excluded Liabilities? \u201d  (D.I. 12 at 7).  Contrary to Spyglass\u2019 \nargument, however, the Bankruptcy Court did not  hold Participations are \u201cliens \u201d in the \u201ctraditional \nsense of the word,\u201d nor did the Bankruptcy Court hold that \u201call Participations are Permitted Liens. \u201d  \n(See D.I. 7 at 24).  The Bankr uptcy Court merely enforced the terms of the parties \u2019 agreement  in \nthe APA : that Spyglass would purchase the Debtors\u2019 assets free and clear of all lien s except for  13 \u201cPermitted Liens ,\u201d a term contractually defined  by the parties  to includ e only post-closing \nParticipation  Right s (id. \u00a7 2.4(j)).  \nFinally, t he Bankruptcy Court\u2019s i nterpretation  avoids an i llogical result .  In the APA, the \nDebtors specifically acknowledged that they owned the Film free and clear except for Permitted \nLiens, which included Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Participation Interest.  (Mem. Op. at 9; APA \u00a7 3.5, AA415-\n416; id. \u00b6 3.10(a) , AA418; id. AA1733- 1734) .  The Sale Order also provides that it contained \nnothing that could \u201cenhance\u201d the Debtors\u2019 interest in any Purchased Asset.  (Sale Order, \u00b6 LL , \nAA368 ).  Under Spyglass\u2019 interpretation, the sale of the Film to Spyglass was subject to \nMr. Weinst ein\u2019s  Participation interest, yet Spyglass was absolved of paying that interest.  The \nBankruptcy Court found nothing under \u00a7 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or the Sale Order t o permit \nsuch a result.  (8/5/2021 Tr. at 30:5- 10, AA2047 (\u201cFurther, I don\u2019t think th at the court would have \nthe power, under Section 363, to sell the cover title free and clear of those participation rights. Even if the court did have the power to do that that was not presented to the court as the basis for excluding the liabilities owed to the affiliates.\u201d)) .  Because courts should not interpret a contract \nto be contrary to law, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that Spyglass\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 2.4 was  \nnot reasonable.  ( See Mem. Op. at 9 (citing Walsh v. Schlecht , 429 U.S. 401, 408 (1977) (\u201cSince a \ngeneral rule of construction presumes the legality and enforceability of contracts, ambiguously worded contracts should not be interpreted to render them illegal and unenforceable where the \nwording lends itself to a logically acceptable construct ion that renders them legal and enforceable. \u201d \n(citing 6A A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 1499, 1533 (1962)) ); Doyle v. U.S. Sec\u2019y of Labor , 285 F.3d \n243, 251 (3d Cir. 2002) (disfavoring a construction of an ambiguous release that would result in it \nbeing declared illegal in light of the \u201cwell- recognized principle of law requiring that ambiguous \ndocuments should not be deemed illegal where ca pable of constructions that will validate them\u201d).  \nThe Bankruptcy Court  instead construed the APA  to harmonize  its various provisions , such that 14 Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Participation  Interest  would be paid by the purchaser of the Film, without that \npurchaser recei ving 1.875% more than the Debtors owned in the first place .   \nC. Spyglass\u2019 Waiver Argument Is Unavailing \n  \nSpyglass argues that because Mr. Weinstein did not object to the Sale Order, he is now \nbarred from arguing that his post -closing Participation Interests are Permitted Liens  under the \nAPA.  It is unclear what facts Spyglass believes should have prompted suc h an objection when the \nAPA clearly lists Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Participation Interest as a Permitted Lien.  Mr. Weinstein \u2019s \nfailure to object to a contrary  interpretation provided no independent reason to deny the Motion to \nEnforce.  Moreover, as Mr. Weinstein correctly points out, this argument was not raised below and \ncannot be raised for the first time on appeal.  Montrose Med . Grp , 243 F.3d at  783. \nD. The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Err by Excluding  Extrinsic Evide nce \nSpyglass argues that the Bankruptcy Court committed revers ible error by denying the \nadmission of the two declarations into evidence in support of Spyglass\u2019 alleged intent.  The proper \nstandard for review of an evidentiary ruling is abuse of discretion.  Stecyk v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc ., 295 F.3d 408, 412 (3d Cir. 2002).  \u201cTo show an abuse of discretion, appellants must \nshow the district court\u2019s action was \u2018arbitrary, fanciful or clearly unreasonable.\u2019\u201d Id . (internal \ncitations omitted).  Spyglass argues that the de clarations prove the i ntent of the parties in drafting \nthe APA to expressly exclude any and all payments to  Robert and Harvey Weinstei n and to \n\u201ccompletely sever \u201d the business from its ties to those  individuals.  ( See D.I. 7 at 29).  Having \nagreed that the APA is unambiguous, any consideration by the Bankruptcy Court  of the extrinsic \nevidence urged now by Spyglass would have been improper, and Spyglass fails to demonstrate \nany abuse of discretion.  Spyglass further argues that this Court can review de novo the declarations \nas part of the record on appeal  but cites no case law in support of this contention.  ( Id.).  This \nrequest must be denied. 15 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Or der is affirmed .
