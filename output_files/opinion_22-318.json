Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJune 30, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nCONNOLLY, oh FCA\n\nPlaintiff Camille Collins appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in\n_ forma pauperis. (D.|. 6) She commenced this action on March 11, 2022. (D.I. 1) The\nCourt proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).\nIL. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.\n2008). Plaintiff filed this action alleging employment discrimination pursuant to Title VII\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e, et seg. (D.I. 1)\n\nPlaintiff was employed by Defendant Goodwill of Delaware and Delaware\nCounty. She alleges discrimination by reason of her race and color. She alleges\nDefendant failed to pay equivalent monetary compensation for janitorial work\nperformed, that Defendant conspired with an external partner and made false\nallegations of sexual harassment against her after she reported the lack of pay issue,\nthat Defendant failed to promote her, and that her employment was terminated on\nOctober 19, 2018. The Complaint states that the EEOC issued a Notice-of-Right-to-Sue\nletter received by Plaintiff on November 29, 2021. (D.I. 2 at 2) The Complaint was filed\non March 11, 2022.\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a\n\ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir.\n1\n\n2013). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take\nthem in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515\nF.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because\nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her Complaint,\n\u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal\npleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\n\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\n\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) i\nmotions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), the Court\n\nmust grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be\n\ninequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\n\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Beil\n2\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem'! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine\nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v.\nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that\nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. /qbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the\n\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d.\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff did not provide the Court with a copy of her right to sue letter from the\nEEOC, that as alleged, was received by Plaintiff on November 29, 2021. Plaintiff\ncommenced this action on March 11, 2022, 102 days later. A claim brought under Title\nVII must be filed within ninety days of a plaintiff's receipt of the notice of suit rights letter.\nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (f)(1); McGovern v. City of Phila., 554 F.3d 114, 115.1 (3d\nCir. 2009). While statute of limitations ordinarily must be raised as an affirmative\ndefense, and is subject to principles of waiver if not timely asserted, a district court has\nauthority to dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint sua sponte under \u00a7 1915(e) if the\nlimitations defense is obvious from the complaint, and if no development of the factual\nrecord is required. See Carter v. Keystone, 360 F. App\u2019x 271, 272-73 (3d Cir. 2010)\n(affirming sua sponte dismissal of Title VII action when face of complaint plainly\nindicated complaint was filed well after expiration of ninety-day period to bring suit).\n\nHence, based upon the allegations, the Complaint was not timely filed. See Edwards v.\n\nBay State Mill. Co., 519 F. App\u2019x 746, 748 (3d Cir. 2013) (Title VII claims dismissed\nwhen employee failed to file employment discrimination complaint within 90 days of\nreceiving EEOC notice of right to sue as required under Title VII).\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the Complaint as time-barred pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (ii).\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss the Complaint as time-barred.\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n4\n"}
