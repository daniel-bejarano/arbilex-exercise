Civil Action No. 22-cv-00475-SRF\nSCHOLLE IPN PACKAGING, INC.\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION!\nIL INTRODUCTION\nPresently before the court in this breach of contract case are two motions: (1) Scholle IPN\nPackaging, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cDefendant\u201d) Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and\nimproper venue, and/or Transfer (\u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d) and (2) Zephyr Fluid Solutions, LLC\u2019s\n(\u2018Plaintiff\u2019) Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings (\u201cMotion to Compel\nArbitration\u201d)? (D.1. 10; D.I. 20) For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Plaintiff's\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings and DENIES without prejudice Defendant\u2019s\nMotion to Dismiss.\ni. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff is a limited liability company, whose members are citizens of Connecticut and\n\nNew York. (D.I. 1 at 97; D.L. 3; D.I. 6) Defendant is a Nevada corporation with its principal\n\n' Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73, the parties consented to\nthe jurisdiction of a magistrate judge to conduct all proceedings in this matter through final\njudgment, and the case was assigned to the undersigned judicial officer on December 6, 2022.\n(.IL. 33)\n\n2 The briefing for the Motion to Dismiss is as follows: Defendant\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 11),\nPlaintiff's answering brief (D.I. 23), and Defendant\u2019s reply brief (D.I. 25).\n\n3 The briefing for the Motion to Compel Arbitration is as follows: Plaintiff's opening brief (D.I.\n21), Defendant\u2019s answering brief (D.I. 28), and Plaintiff's reply (D.L. 29).\nplace of business in Northlake, Illinois. (D.L 1 at J 8)\n\nThe parties negotiated a contract in which Plaintiff served as the Defendant\u2019s exclusive\nsales representative to promote and solicit sales of Defendant\u2019s water bags and equipment to\ncertain customers from Plaintiff's contacts in the beverage industry. (/d. at J] 2, 22) On October\n31, 2018, the parties entered into a Sales Representative Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d). (/d. at J 1)\n\nThe Agreement has a Delaware choice of law provision. (Jd. at 24; see D.I. 13 at \u00a7\n15.10) The Agreement also contains an arbitration provision which states:\n\nIn the event of any dispute between the parties hereto concerning or relating to this\n\nagreement, upon request of either party, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding\n\narbitration in the State of Delaware, in accordance with the rules of the American\n\nArbitration Association.\n\n(id.)\n\nIn an amendment on September 15, 2020, the parties extended the Agreement\u2019s minimum\nperformance period from two years to three years. (D.I. 1 at ] 25) Plaintiff alleges that\nbeginning in May of 2021, Defendant materially breached the Agreement by its failure to\nrespond to Plaintiff's requests for product samples, failure to provide necessary documentation\nof sales activity, and failure to submit its payments on time. (See e.g., id. at {J 30-37)\n\nOn April 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed the instant Complaint alleging breach of contract\n(Count I) and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count II). (/d. at 7]\n102-113) No allegations about the arbitration agreement appear in the Complaint. (See D.I. 1)\nOn June 1, 2022, Defendant filed its Motion to Dismiss. (D.I. 10) On June 10, 2022, Plaintiff\nsent the Defendant a written request for arbitration pursuant to section 15.10 of the Agreement.\n\n(D.I. 22, Ex. A)\nOn July 13, 2022, Defendant filed a mirror image Complaint in the Northern District of\nIllinois (\u201cIllinois Action\u201d) alleging breach of contract.* (No. 22-3637, D.I. 1) On August 8,\n2022, Plaintiff filed the present Motion to Compel Arbitration and, in the Illinois Action, moved\nto stay the case due to the Motions pending in this court. (respectively, D.I. 20; No. 22-3637,\nD.L. 11) On January 11, 2023, the court in the Illinois Action granted Plaintiff's Motion to Stay\nProceedings pending this court\u2019s decision on the Motions. (No. 22-3637, D.I. 18)\n\nIll. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nThis dispute concerns an arbitration agreement in an interstate commercial contract, so it\nis governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d). See Trippe Mfg. Co. v. Niles Audio Corp.,\n401 F.3d 529, 532 (3d Cir. 2005). The FAA provides that written agreements to arbitrate\ndisputes \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Pursuant to the FAA, the\ncourt should stay an action and compel arbitration when, in a pending suit, \u201cany issue [is]\nreferable to arbitration.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4. A district court also has discretion to dismiss an\naction if all the issues raised are arbitrable and must be submitted to arbitration. See BAE Sys.\nAircraft Controls, Inc. v. Eclipse Aviation Corp., 224 F.R.D. 581, 585 (D. Del. 2004). The\nanswer to the question of whether a party invoking the arbitration clause waived its right to\narbitrate is necessarily case specific, and thus, depends on the circumstances and context of each\ncase. Gray Holdco, Inc. v. Cassady, 654 F.3d 444, 451 (3d Cir. 2011).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\nDefendant does not dispute that had the arbitration agreement not been waived, this court\n\nhas jurisdiction to compel arbitration or enforce an arbitration award. (D.I. 25 at 3) See IMEG\n\n4 Scholle IPN Packaging, Inc. v. Zephyr Fluid Solutions, LLC, No. 22-3637 (N.D. Ill. July 13,\n2022).\nCorp. v. Patel, No. 20-111-CFC, 2021 WL 184407, at *7 (D. Del. Jan. 19, 2021) (noting that\n\u201cwhen a party consents to arbitration in a particular forum it necessarily consents to personal\njurisdiction in the district court of that forum\u201d for purposes of litigating disputes related to the\narbitration agreement); HealthplanCRM, LCC v. AvMed, Inc., 458 F. Supp. 3d 308, 320 (W.D.\nPa. 2020) (stating that an agreement to arbitrate all disputes in a specific venue \u201cimplies consent\nto the jurisdiction of the corresponding district court[,] though only for all cases arising out of the\nparties\u2019 arbitration, such as a motion to compel arbitration and/or to enforce an arbitration\naward\u201d). Therefore, this court has jurisdiction over the pending Motion to Compel Arbitration.\n\nA. Plaintiff Did Not Waive Its Right to Arbitrate\n\nThe question before the court is whether the Plaintiff knowingly relinquished the right to\narbitrate by acting inconsistently with that right. See Zenon v. Dover Downs, Inc., No. 21-1194-\nRGA, 2022 WL 2304118 (D. Del. June 27, 2022). Zenon explained the change in the legal\nstandard for determining whether assertion of a contractual arbitration agreement is waived.\nPrior to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Morgan v. Sundance, 142 S. Ct. 1708 (2022), the District\nCourt followed the Third Circuit\u2019s test in Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co., Inc., 980 F.2d\n912 (3d Cir. 1992), which assesses whether sufficient prejudice exists to support a finding that\nthe right to arbitrate has been waived.\u00b0\n\nIn Sundance, the Supreme Court eliminated consideration of prejudice and held that a\n\ncourt may not impose a more exacting standard for waiver of the right to enforce an arbitration\n\n> The six nonexclusive factors the Third Circuit identified in Hoxworth to guide the prejudice\ninquiry are: (1) timeliness or lack thereof of the motion to arbitrate; (2) the degree to which the\nparty seeking arbitration has contested the merits of its opponent\u2019s claims; (3) whether the party\nseeking arbitration informed its adversary of its intent to pursue arbitration prior to filing to\nenjoin the court proceedings; (4) the extent to which a party seeking arbitration engaged in non-\nmerits motion practice; (5) the party\u2019s assent to the court\u2019s pretrial orders; and (6) the extent to\nwhich the parties have engaged in discovery. Hoxworth, 980 F.2d at 926-27.\n\n4\nagreement than it imposes for waiver of any other contractual right. 142 S. Ct. at 1712-13. The\nCourt ruled, \u201cSection 6 [of the Federal Arbitration Act] instructs that prejudice is not a condition\nof finding that a party, by litigating too long, waived its right to stay litigation or compel\narbitration under the FAA.\u201d Jd. at 1714. Instead, the proper waiver inquiry focuses on whether\nthe party asserting arbitration \u201cknowingly relinquish[ed] the right to arbitrate by acting\ninconsistently with that right.\u201d Jd.\n\nZenon involved consideration of whether the defendant employer in a discrimination case\nhad waived its right to assert an arbitration provision in the employment agreement. 2022 WL\n2304118, at *1-2. In finding that the right had not been waived, the court took into\nconsideration that the defendant\u2019s motion to compel arbitration was the first substantive motion\nin the case, it was filed within six months of the commencement of the suit, and, other than\nserving Initial Disclosures, the parties had not commenced discovery. Jd. at *2. Therefore, the\ncourt ruled that the defendant\u2019s actions did not evince an intent to \u201cknowingly relinquish the\nright to arbitrate by acting inconsistently with that right.\u201d Id.\n\nLikewise, here, Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration was filed roughly two months\nfollowing Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, and almost one month after Defendant filed a mirror\nimage suit in the Northern District of Illinois. (See D.I. 10; D.I. 20; No. 22-3637, D.I. 1) In\naddition, Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration was filed within four months of the\ncommencement of this suit, and the parties have not engaged in any discovery nor have they\nfiled their Initial Disclosures pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1). (See D.I. 1)\nSee also E. Hedinger AG v. Brainwave Sci., LLC, 363 F. Supp. 3d 499, 507 (D. Del. 2019)\n\n(concluding that the defendant did not waive the right to arbitrate based on the fact that the case\nwas in the early stages and no discovery had occurred).\n\nContrary to Defendant\u2019s argument, the case authorities on which Defendant relies do not\nstand for the proposition that a party waives arbitration by the act of filing a complaint alone nor\nare they binding precedent on this court. (D.I. 28 at 2-3). See Stoltz Realty Co. v. Raphael, 458\nA.2d 21 (Del. 1983); SATCOM Int'l Grp. PLC v. ORBCOMM Int\u2019l Partners, L.P., 49 F. Supp.\n2d 331 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 205 F.3d 1324 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\nIn Stoltz Realty Co., the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed summary judgment for the\ndefendants following resolution of the dispute through voluntary arbitration as there was no\ncontractual arbitration agreement in issue. 458 A.2d at 21-22. The Delaware Supreme Court\nfound the plaintiff \u201chad voluntarily waived its right to pursue the [defendants] and can not [sic]\nnow revive it, having lost the claim at arbitration.\u201d Jd. at 23. In SATCOM, the court found that\nunder the agreement in dispute the plaintiff could have pursued arbitration and at the same time\nbrought an injunctive action to maintain the status quo pending completion of arbitration. 49 F.\nSupp. 2d at 338. Instead, the plaintiff chose to litigate the merits and, having made that choice, it\nhad no right under the agreement to abandon the litigation and start afresh with arbitration. Jd.\n\nSimilar circumstances are not present in the pending case. Here, the case is in its early\nstages. There has been no discovery and the Motions that have been briefed do not address the\nmerits, rather, they concern jurisdiction and the proper forum for an adjudication of the merits.\nTherefore, the court finds that the Plaintiff's actions do not demonstrate an intent to \u201cknowingly\nrelinquish the right to arbitrate by acting inconsistently with that right.\u201d Zenon, 2022 WL\n\n2304118, at *2.\nB. The \u2018No Waiver\u2019 Clause\n\nThe Agreement contains a \u2018no waiver\u2019 clause in section 15.3 that states as follows:\n\nThe failure of either party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions, rights or\n\nobligations of this Agreement shall not be considered a waiver of such provisions, rights\n\nor obligations.\n(I. 13)\n\nDefendant argues that the court should not enforce the \u2018no waiver\u2019 clause in the\nAgreement and relies for support on the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in Gray Holdco, Inc., 654 F.3d\nat 452, which holds that a waiver analysis must still be undertaken by the court notwithstanding\nthe inclusion of the \u2018no waiver\u2019 provision in the contract. (D.I. 28 at 9)\n\nIn Gray Holdco, Inc., the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement contained a \u2018no waiver\u2019 provision\nthat allowed either party to seek injunctive or equitable relief from the court until the completion\nof the arbitration or until the case was otherwise resolved. 654 F.3d at 452. The court found that\nthe provision did not act as a \u201cshield\u201d against waiver nor did it alter the ordinary analysis the\ncourt undertakes to determine if a party has waived an agreement to arbitrate. Jd. At the time of\nthe decision, the Hoxworth factors governed the analysis, so the Third Circuit applied them to the\nplaintiff's litigation conduct as a whole. Jd. at 454-61. The court noted that the case had been\n\u201cintensely litigated\u201d by the plaintiff. Jd at 449. It found that from the time the plaintiff initiated\nthe suit and for ten months thereafter until its arbitration demand, the plaintiff litigated in\ncompliance with various case management orders of the District Court, participated in extensive\ndiscovery and status conferences, and demonstrated through its conduct that its plan was to\nproceed with the litigation. Jd. at 461. The plaintiff changed course and demanded arbitration\n\nafter obtaining new counsel. Jd.\nThe court agrees that under Gray Holdco, Inc., the inclusion of a \u2018no waiver\u2019 provision in\nthe Agreement is not alone dispositive of whether Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration\nshould be granted. The court has considered it along with Plaintiff's litigation conduct as a\nwhole and finds for the reasons discussed, supra, that the Plaintiff's actions do not evince an\nintent to knowingly relinquish the right to arbitrate by acting inconsistently with that right.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss without\nprejudice (D.I. 10) and GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration (D.I. 20). The case is\nSTAYED pending the outcome of the arbitration.\n\nThe parties should submit to this court a status update on the progress of the arbitration\nno later than six (6) months from the date of this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nThe oral argument scheduled in this case for February 8, 2023, at 11AM is\nCANCELLED.\n\nAn Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nDated: February {__, 2023\n\nUnited States\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nZEPHYR FLUID SOLUTIONS, LLC\nPlaintiff,\n\n)\n)\n)\n)\nv. ) Civil Action No. 22-cv-00475-SRF\n)\nSCHOLLE IPN PACKAGING, INC. )\n\n)\n\n)\n\nDefendant.\n\nAt Wilmington this kh day of February, 2023, the court having considered the parties\u2019\nbriefing on the pending Motions and for the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this same date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and/or\nTransfer (D.I. 10) is DENIED without prejudice, and Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration\n(D.I. 20) is GRANTED.
