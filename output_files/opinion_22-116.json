{"case_name": "Maugain et al v. FCA US LLC", "case_number": "22-116", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "10-24-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nETIENNE MAUGAIN et al., \nPlaintiffs , \nV. Civil Action No. 22-116-GBW \nFCA US LLC, \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiffs Etienne Maugain , Louise Shumate, Denise Hunter, Harry Reichlen , John \nKundrath , Kenneth Esteves, John Skleres, Richard Archer, Stephen Dreikosen , and Leonel Cantu \n(collectively , \"Plaintiffs \") filed this consumer class action against Defendant FCA US LLC \n(\"FCA\") to obtain monetary relief based on FCA's alleged failure to disclose engine defects in \n\"2014 or newer Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, or RAM-branded vehicles equipped with 3.6L Pentastar \nV6 engine ('Class Vehicles ').\" D.I. 34 at 1, 191. Pending before the Court now is non-party \nJames Martin's (\"Martin\") Motion to Be Added as a Plaintiff (Pro-Se) in this Complaint (D.I. 25, \nthe \"First Intervention Motion\"), Motion for Leave to Be Joined as a Plaintiff (D.I. 26, the \n\"Second Intervention Motion\"), and Motion for Copy of Records (D.I. 27). Martin's Second \nIntervention Motion asks, in the alternative, that he be added as a class member. D.I. 26. For the \nreasons explained in more detail below, the Court finds that Martin does not meet the standard to \nintervene under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. Thus, the Court denies the First \nIntervention Motion and the Second Intervent ion Motion. The Court also denies the Motion for \nCopy of Records as moot. 1 \n1 The motions are fully briefed, D.I. 25; D.I. 26; D.I. 27; D.I. 29, and no hearing is necessary . \n1 I. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs allege that FCA sold Class Vehicles \"with a defective 3.6L engine and falsely \nmarketed the vehicles as safe to drive, durable, reliable, and capable of providing transportation .\" \nD.I. 34 ,r,r 1, 3. The defective engines \"prematurely fail\" and are unable to accomplish \"the \nfundamental elements of the function of an internal combustion engine .... \" D.I. 34 ,r 4. FCA \nhas also instructed car dealers to replace defective parts with new parts that have the same defect \n\"while informing consumers that the vehicles are fixed, including when repairs were made under \nwarranty.\" D.I. 34 ,r 11. \nFCA is a Delaware limited liability company (LLC) headquartered in Auburn Hills, \nMichigan that \"designs, manufactures , markets, distributes , services, repairs, sells, and leases\" \nthe Class Vehicles \"nationwide. \" D.I. 34 ,r 156. \"FCA provides warranty coverage for Class \nVehicles under one or more warranties[,]\" such as a \"a 7-year/100,000 mile powertrain limited \nwarranty for vehicles which are purchased certified pre-owned. \" D .I. 34 ,r 21. FCA' s sole \nmember is another Delaware LLC, and that LLC's sole member is Fiat Chrysler Automobiles \nN.V., \"which was incorporated as a public limited liability company \" in the Netherlands and is \nheadquartered in the United Kingdom. D.I. 34 ,r 156. FCA sells the Class Vehicles through a \nnationwide dealer network, but it sells warranties directly to consumers. D.I. 34 ,r 159. \nMartin, an Indiana resident, alleges, in his First Intervention Motion, that he purchased a \nClass Vehicle ( a certified pre-owned 2014 Chrysler 200); that FCA knew of but failed to disclose \ndefects in the engine of his Class Vehicle; and that he, consequently , overpaid for a defective \nvehicle that he must pay to have fixed and that he cannot use for its intended purpose. D.I. 25 ,r,r \n1, 14-15, 19, 25, 45. Martin also submits an April 11, 2022 letter from Martin to the Chrysler \nCorporation that asserts Martin had a vehicle warranty . See D.I. 25 at 54. Martin's First \nIntervention Motion appears largely copied from Plaintiffs ' original complaint in this action, \n2 which was filed on January 28, 2022. Compare, e.g., D.I. 1 ,r,r 129, 135, 189,201, with D.I. 25 \n,r,r 90, 96, 132, 143 (containing identical language) . In his Second Intervention Motion, Martin \n\"seeks leave to be added as a Pro-se Plaintiff in this matter, or added as a Class Member pursuant \nto his earlier filing of his version of his complaint against [FCA].\" D.I. 26. Martin also asserts \nthat he \"is a vict(i]m of [FCA] 's defective products and ha[ s] proven his case beyond a \nreasonable doubt with his version of his lawsuit, similar to that of the original filing, yet with \ninvoices and damages.\" D.I. 26. In a separate motion, Martin \"seeks a copy of the record for his \nreview and records\" and asserts that he is \"legally indigent.\" D.I. 27. FCA asks the Court to \ndeny Martin's Intervention Motions under Rule 24(a) and (b). D.I. 29 at 1. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"A motion to intervene ... must state the grounds for intervention and be accompanied \nby a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n24(c). Rule 24(a) provides as follows: \nOn timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who: (1) is given an \nunconditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or (2) claims an interest \nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so \nsituated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede \nthe movant' s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately \nrepresent that interest. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). To intervene by right, a party must show \"(1) a sufficient interest in the \nlitigation; (2) 'a threat that the interest will be impaired or affected, as a practical matter, by the \ndisposition of the action'; and (3) that its interest is not adequately represented by the existing \nparties to the litigation.\" Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. President United States of Am., 888 \nF.3d 52, 57 (3d Cir. 2018) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). \"[A]n applicant's interests are \nnot adequately represented if they diverge sufficiently from the interests of the existing party, \n3 such that 'the existing party cannot devote proper attention to the applicant's interests.\" ' Id at \n60 ( citation omitted). \nRule 24(b) allows the Court to permit the intervention of any party who \"(A) is given a \nconditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or (B) has a claim or defense that shares with \nthe main action a common question of law or fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(l). \"[D]istrict courts \nhave broader discretion in making a determination about whether permissive intervention is \nappropriate as opposed to intervention as of right.\" United States v. Territory of Virgin Islands, \n748 F.3d 514, 524 (3d Cir. 2014). The Third Circuit has previously upheld the denial of \npermissive intervention for the same reasons that a district court denied a motion for intervention \nby right. See id. at 524-25 (\"The District Court in this case denied [the] Rule 24(b) permissive \nintervention motion for the same reasons it denied the motion pursuant to Rule 24(a).\"); Brody \nBy & Through Sugzdinis v. Spang, 957 F .2d 1108, 1124 (3d Cir. 1992) (\"[I]f intervention as of \nright is not available, the same reasoning would indicate that it would not be an abuse of \ndiscretion to deny permissive intervention as well.\"). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nThe Court denies the First Intervention Motion and the Second Intervention Motion under \nRule 24(a) and (b). In this action, Martin asserts no statute-and FCA fails to identify any \nstatute-that gives Martin the right to or permission to intervene. See D.I. 29 at 3. Martin also \ncannot meet the remaining requirements for intervention by right. First, Martin cannot show that \ndisposition of this action would, practically , impair or affect his interests. Martin seeks \ncompensation for the cost of repairing his vehicle. D.I. 26 (seeking \"damages\"); D.I. 25 at 48 \n(seeking \"at least[] $50,000 in reimbursement and costs\"), 53-54 (submitting a receipt for \n$893.34 from Eric's USA Automotive , LLC, Martin's \"personal mechanic\"). If Plaintiffs pursue \nmonetary damages, see D.I. 34 at 191 (seeking \"[r]estution, compensatory damages , and costs\"), \n4 and if Martin is included in the class, see D.I.2511 (alleging purchase of a Class Vehicle), \nMartin will have the right to request exclusion from the class, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), \n(c)(2)(B)(v) (requiring notice to Rule 23(b)(3) class members of the ability to opt-out); Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 362 (2011) (\"[I]ndividualized monetary claims belong in \nRule 23(b)(3).\"). \nSecond, Martin cannot show that Plaintiffs fail to adequately represent Martin's interests \nfor two reasons. The first reason is that Martin's lawsuit is nearly identical to the Plaintiffs' suit. \nMartin explains in his Second Intervention Motion that he \"is a vict(i]m of [FCA]' s defective \nproducts\" and that \"his version of his lawsuit\" is \"similar to that of the original filing, yet with \ninvoices and damages.\" D.I. 26. Indeed, as explained above, Martin's First Intervention Motion \nappears to copy verbatim much of the language in the Plaintiffs ' original complaint (a complaint \nPlaintiffs have since revised, see D.I. 34). The second reason is that Plaintiffs seek to \nrepresent-as to three of their claims-a nationwide class of \"[a]ll persons or entities in the \nUnited States ... that purchased or leased\" a \"2014 or newer Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, or RAM\u00ad\nbranded vehicle \u25a1 equipped with the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine .... \" D.I.34111, 262. Martin, \naccording to his First Intervention Motion, would be part of that class. See D.I. 25 11 1 (alleging \nthe purchase of a \"2014 Chrysle[r] 200 equipped with the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine\"), 25 \n( alleging the purchase of a \"certified pre-owned 2014 Chrysler 200\"). For all these reasons, the \nCourt finds that Martin has no right to intervene. \nThe Court also denies permissive intervention for the same reasons. Plaintiffs assert the \nsame injuries as Martin asserts and would include Martin in their nationwide class. Martin may \nalso opt out of the class, so there is no reason this action must impair or affect his interest in \n5 compensation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), (c)(2)(B)(v) (requiring opt-out notice to Rule \n23(b)(3) class members); D.I. 25 at 48 (seeking \"compensatory damages\"). \nLastly, Martin moves, in the alternative, to be added as a member of Plaintiffs' class. \nD.I. 26. The Court cannot grant class membership when the class does not exist at this stage of \nthe litigation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(l) (requiring a class certification order). The Court will \ndetermine whether Martin is a class member when it rules on class certification. See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(c)(l)(B) (\"An order that certifies a class action must define the class .... \"). Martin's \nI \nmotion to be added as a class member is premature at this time. Thus, the Court denies the \nSecond Intervention Motion without prejudice to the extent Martin seeks to be added as a class \nmember. \nFor the above reasons, the Court denies the First Intervention Motion and the Second \nIntervention Motion. Given that the Court has denied Martin's Intervention Motions, Martin will \nhave no need for or right to the records of this action beyond that of a member of the general \npublic. Thus, Martin's Motion for Copy of Records, D.I. 27, is denied as moot. \nTherefore , at Wilmington this 24th day of October 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \nthat Martin's Motion to Be Added as a Plaintiff (Pro-Se) in this Complaint (D .I. 25) and Motion \nfor Leave to Be Joined as a Plaintiff (D.I. 26) are DENIED and that Martin's Motion for Copy of \nRecords (D.I. 27) is DENIED as moot. \nID% \nREGOR YB.
