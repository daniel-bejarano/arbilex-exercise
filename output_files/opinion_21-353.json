Whether  by skill or luck , Joseph Corso timed his actions to \nsqueak out a fraction of his contract claim . Change almost any fact , and his claim \nwould  be totally  time -barred. But after  interpreting the contract and plugging in the \nundisputed facts, no issue remains  for trial . So I grant  in part  each party\u2019s motion for \nsummary judgment.   \n2 I. BACKGROUND  \nCorso and his business partners owned three companies  that sold medical prod-\nucts. The partners were investigated by the federal government  for fraud . To settle \nthe fraud claims , Corso and his partners  had to  sell the companies. Concordia \nHealthcare bought them  as one consolidated business , Complete Medical Homecare . \nThis case is about one of the  contract s executing that transaction . \nA. The contract  \nThat  contract addressed  Corso\u2019s compensation . It was entitled \u201cPROMISSORY \nNOTE\u201d but functioned like an earnout \u2014a contract in which the Corso\u2019s compensation \ndepend ed on how well Complete Medical  did over time. D.I.  1-1 at 2. It said that Con-\ncordia would  pay Corso \u201ca principal sum of up to  US$4,200,000, together with interest \n\u2026 at an annual rate equal to six percent (6%), in the ma nner provided below.\u201d Id. \n(emphasis added) . The \u201cmanner provided\u201d was this: Concordia \u201cshall deliver a prin-\ncipal payment annually \u2026 in an amount calculated in accordance with schedule  A [] \ncommencing on October 2 5, 2014, and on October 25 of each year thereafter until the \nearlier of  the obligations hereunder being paid in full  or October 25, 2020. Interest on \nthe unpaid principal balance \u2026 shall be due and payable annually, together with each \npayment of principal.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1.1 (emphasis added) . \nSchedule  A tie d each year\u2019s principal payment to Complete Medical\u2019s  earnings \nover the past year . The more the company  made , the more Corso got. For each  earn-\nings range , sch edule  A prescribed a corresponding principal payment : if Complete  \n3 Medical earned  $2 million or less in a given year, Corso got nothing ; if it made be-\ntween $2 million and $3  million, he got $120,000 ; and so on.  Id. at 6.  \nThe contract also allowed some  modifications  to the payment schedule . Key to this \ncase is the contract\u2019s  \u201cRight of Setoff.\u201d Id. at 2 \u00a7 1.4. That provision gave  Concordia \n\u201cthe right to withhold and set off against any amount  [principal or interest]  due here-\nunder the amount of damages  for which [Concordia] is entitled to indemnification  \nunder, and as determined in accordance with the provisions of, \u201d the transactio n\u2019s \nother agreements.  Id. \u201cIndemnification\u201d means the \u201caction of compensating for actual \nloss or damage sustained; the payment with this object.\u201d Indemnification , Garner\u2019s \nDictionary of Legal Usage  (3d ed. 2011). So to exercise  its setoff right, Concordia must \nhave been entitled to payment  from Corso  \u201cin accordance with\u201d the other agreements . \nThose other agreements set out a three -step indemnification process . First, Con-\ncordia had to  have been harmed by an indemnifiable event.  Put differently, Corso had \nto indemnify  \u201call Damages which [Concordia] may incur or suffer in connection with \nor relating to [a series of enumerated events].\u201d See D.I. 47 at 78 \u00a7 10.2. \u201cDamages\u201d \nwere  defined as \u201cany loss, damage, injury, award, fine, penalty, Tax, fee or expense.\u201d \nId. at 31.  \nSecond, Concordia had to \u201cgive prompt written notice\u201d of its indemnification claim. \nId. at 80 \u00a7 10.5. That notice had to  have laid out the basic facts, the estimated dam-\nages, and the basis for indemnification. Id.  \nThird, the Damages  had to  have been \u201cagree d to by the Indemnifying party  [Corso]  \nor finally adjudicated to be payable.\u201d Id. at 81 \u00a7 10.8. Once that happen ed, Corso had  \n4 to \u201csatisfy [his] obligations as provided in Section  10.12.\u201d Id. That  final section sa id \nConcordia could not collect from Corso directly. Instead, Concordia could \u201csatisfy the \nDamages for which it is entitle d to indemnification \u201d only \u201c by offsetting principal or \ninterest\u201d of the Promissory Note. Id. at 82 \u00a7 10.12.  \nSo for Concordia to exercise its setoff right , it must have suffer ed \u201cDamages ,\u201d pro-\nvided notice, and reach ed an agreement  with Corso  or gotten  a final judgment  fixing \nits Damages . \nReturning to the contract at issue , it also  specifie d what happen ed if Concordia \nfailed to pay.  The contract define d three \u201cEvents of Default.\u201d D.I. 1 -1 \u00a7 2.1. The first \ntwo relate d to bankruptcy and are irrelevant here. \u00a7 2.1(a) \u2013(b). The third dealt with  \nConcordia\u2019s \u201cfailure \u2026 to pay any amount of principal or interest due under this Note \nwithin 15  days of such amount becoming due.\u201d \u00a7 2.1(c).  If Concordia  default ed, Corso \ncould \u201cdeclare the entire unpaid principal balance of this Note, together with all ac-\ncrued interest thereon, immediately due and payable\u201d and \u201cexercise any and all rights \nand remedies \u2026 under applicable law.\u201d \u00a7 2.3. In other words , he could accelerate the \npayments and sue for the whole amount.  \nFinally, the contract include d a choice -of-law provision : \u201cThis Note will be gov-\nerned by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to \nconflicts -of-laws principles.\u201d \u00a7 3.5. \nB. The dispute  \nAfter the acquisition , Complete Medical  rapidly declined . In 2014, it earned about \n$5.1 million. D.I. 43 at 112. So u nder schedule  A, Corso was entitled to $480,000 on \nthe principal plus $252,000 in interest  (6% of the outstanding  $4.2 million) . In 2015,  \n5 Complete Medical  made  just $1.5 million , entitling Corso to no principal payment. Id. \nat 132. And because of the previous year\u2019s $480,000 principal reduction , the interest \npayment was now  $223,200  ($4.2  million  \u2212 $480,000  = $3.72 million; 6% of $3.72 mil-\nlion = $223,200) . Id. at 149.  In December 2015,  Concordia dissolve d Complete Medi-\ncal. Id. at 134 \u201335, 139.  After dissolution, of course, its earnings were zero . Id. at 142. \nSo Concordia told Corso that it would not make  any future  principal payments. Id. \nBut the interest payments, at least in theory, would continue to be due.  \nYet Corso never saw a dime. Concordia said that  after several indemnifiable \nevents,  everything it owed was subject to setoff . Most importantly, j ust two days be-\nfore the transaction between Concordia and Corso closed , Express Scripts  (one of \nComplete Medical\u2019s  vendors)  told Corso that it had found more than $4.3  million in \nbilling \u201cdiscrepancies.\u201d Id. at 54. Express Scripts said that it would  withhold that \namount  from future payments . Id. Corso did not tell Concordia before the deal closed.  \nConcordia fo und out  a few months later , when Express Scripts withheld nearly \n$1.1 million. Id. at 67 \u201369. Combined with some smaller  indemnifiable events , even \nCorso agrees that Concordia was entitled to at least $1.2  million in setoffs. Id. at 128 \u2013\n30, 144 ; D.I. 46 at 5. Concordia, on the other hand, contends that it should get to set \noff the full $4.3 million  report from Express Scripts . See D.I. 41 at 19 \u201320. \nCorso did not appreciate  Concordia\u2019s nonpayment. In 2015, his lawyer sent Con-\ncordia a letter  saying that  \u201cmy client exercises  his right\u201d to accelerate the contract . \nD.I. 43 at 122. But when Concordia ignored him, he did not sue. So too in 2016. Id. at \n140. And again  in 2017. But unlike the  two previous letters, the one in 2017  was  \n6 conditional. It said that \u201c if Concordia does not cure the default [in a few weeks], Mr. \nCorso will exercise his right\u201d to accelerate the payments. D.I.  47 at 22  (emphases \nadded) . And in 2020, he made a \u201cdemand for payment,\u201d but not for full payment. \nD.I. 43 at 148 . Instead, he again said the remaining balance \u201c will be due and payable \nin full\u201d in the future. Id. (emphasis added). Nothing in the record shows that Corso \nfollowed up on these threat s. \nC. Summary judgment  \nCorso alleges several breaches . Broadly, he says Concordia breached the contract \nby failing to pay him principal and interest. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17\u201320. On top of \nbreaches for each payment, he says dissolving  Complete Medical  breached the im-\nplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21\u201325. He also says th is breach \nprevented Complete Medical from meeting its earnings targets, so the earnings con-\ndition on  the principal payments should be excused. D.I.  46 at 14 \u201315.  \nThe parties now cros s-move for summary judgment. D.I.  38, D.I.  45. \u201cThe court \nshall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute \nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \u201d \nFed. R. Civ. P.  56(a). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d if a reasonable jury could find for either \nside. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 25 1\u201352 (1986). And a fact is \u201cma-\nterial\u201d if it \u201ccould affect the outcome.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey , 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d \nCir. 2011). I view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. Id. at 179 n.1.  \nContract interpretation is a question of law. Exelon Generation Acquisitions, LLC \nv. Deere & Co. , 176 A.3d 1262, 1266 \u201367 (Del. 2017).  Delaware law uses the objective  \n7 theory of contract s, meaning that  I must give effect to the whole agreement through  \nthe contract\u2019s express terms . Salamone v. Gorman , 106 A.3d 354, 368 (Del. 2014).  \nII. THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS  \nI start with  the statute of limitations. But to determine which statute of limitat ions \napplies, I must decide (1)  which state\u2019s law applies and (2)  what kind of contract this is.  \nA. Choice of law \nCorso\u2019s claims arise under state law . So state law provides the substantive law \nwhile federal law determines procedure.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1652.  Because statutes of limita-\ntions are outcome -determinative, they are substantive.  Guaranty Tr. Co. of N.Y. v. \nYork , 326 U.S. 99, 107 \u201310 (1945).  Thus,  the appli cable statute of limitations is a state -\nlaw question.  \nBut the parties dispute which  state\u2019s law applies. Concordia says it should be Del-\naware\u2019s; Corso wants New York\u2019s.  As a starting point, I apply the choice -of-law rules \nof the forum  state , Delaware . Klax on Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co. , 313 U.S. 487, 496 \u2013\n97 (1941) . Though  the contract asserts that Delaware law will apply \u201cwithout regard \nto conflicts -of-laws principles,\u201d that does not end the matter. Delaware law requires  \nthat a choice -of-law provision spe cify that it  includes  the statute of limitations. See \nPivotal Payments Direct Corp. v. Planet Payment, Inc. , 2015 WL 11120934, at *3 (Del. \nSuper. Ct. Dec. 29, 2015); Weinstein v. Luxeyard, Inc. , 2022 WL 130973, at *3 (Del. \nSuper. Ct. Jan. 14, 2022) . \nWithout an explicit contractual provision,  Delaware law defaults to the forum\u2019s \nstatute of limitations  (here, Delaware\u2019s itself) . See Chaplake Holdings, Ltd. v. Chrys-\nler Corp. , 766 A.2d 1, 5 (Del.  2001) ; Pivotal Payments , 2015 WL 11120934, at *3.  The  \n8 only exception is when a foreign state\u2019s  statute of limitations  is \u201cinseparably interwo-\nven\u201d with a party\u2019s substantive rights. Pivotal Payments , 2015 WL 11120934, at *3 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \nCorso contends that New York\u2019s six -year statute of limit ations should apply be-\ncause that state has the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d to the contract. D.I.  53 at 4 \u2013\n6. But the most -significant -relationship test chooses the law governing the terms of \nthe contract , not the statute of limitations . Compare  Restatem ent (Second) of Conflict \nof Laws \u00a7  186, with \u00a7 142. Corso has not argued that New York\u2019s statute of limitations  \nis \u201cinseparably interwoven\u201d with his rights. And there is no reason to think so: under \nthe contract\u2019s  choice -of-law clause, his substantive rights are also governed by Dela-\nware law . See id. \u00a7 187; Weinstein , 2022 WL 130973, at *3 . Because Delaware is the \nforum state,  and no exception applies, its law supplies the statute of limitations.  \nB. Interpreting Delaw are law  \nWithin Delaware law, I must figure out which statute of limitations applies. That \nquestion turns on how Delaware classifies this contract. Delaware imposes a three -\nyear statute of limitations for most contracts . 10 Del. C. \u00a7  8106(a); Weinstein , 2022 \nWL 130973, at * 4. But it extends  the limitations period to six years for \u201cpromissory \nnotes.\u201d  \u00a7 8109; Weinstein , 2022 WL 130973, at * 4. \nMerely labeling a contract  a \u201cPROMISSORY NOTE \u201d does not make it so . I must \ndecide  what the phrase means under Delaware law and whether this contract fits \nthat description. The parties propose competing approaches. Concordia says I should \nlook to Delaware case law. Corso says I should look to a  definition in a  different Title \nof the Delaware Code.  Concordia is right .  \n9 Delaware courts have held that  the terms  \u201cpromissory note,\u201d \u201cnote,\u201d and \u201cnegotia-\nble instrument\u201d are interchangeable. See Saunders v. Stella , 1989 WL 89518, at *2 \n(Del. Super. Ct. June 29, 1989); Weinstein , 2022 WL 130973,  at *5. Those terms re-\nquire  \u201ca written promise by one person to pay another person, absolutely and uncon-\nditionally, a sum certain at a specified time.\u201d Saunders , 1989 WL 89518, at *2  (citing  \nPromissory Note , Black\u2019s Law Dictionary  (5th ed. 1979)); accord  Weinstein , 2022 WL \n130973, at * 5; 6 Del. C. \u00a7  3-104(a). \u201c [A] promise is unconditional unless  it states: (1) an \nexpress condition to payment; (2)  that the promise is subject to or governed by an-\nother writing; or (3)  that rights or obligations with respect to  the promise are stated \nin another writing. \u201d Weinstein , 2022 WL 130973, at * 5 (emphasis added); accord  6 \nDel. C. \u00a7  3-106(a).  And a \u201csum certain\u201d is an amount that is \u201cfixed\u201d and \u201ccan be ascer-\ntained from the document.\u201d Sum Certain , Black\u2019s Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019) . So \nDelaware precedent holds that a \u201cpromissory note\u201d must be an unconditional promise \nto pay  a fixed amount of m oney at a particular time.  \nCorso, on the other hand, points to the definition of \u201cpromissory note \u201d in 6 Del. C. \n\u00a7 9-102(a)(65): \u201c[A] n instrument that evidences a promise to pay a monetary obliga-\ntion, does not evidence an order to pay, and does n ot contain an acknowledgment by \na bank that the bank has received for deposit a sum of money or funds .\u201d His argument \nhas several flaws. Most importantly, this definition applies to only the part of the \nDelaware Code in which it appears : Article  9, which cov ers secured transactions. \u00a7  9-\n102(a).  And Corso\u2019s agreement with Concordia was clearly not a secured transaction.   \n10 Even on its own terms, Corso\u2019s definition does not get him where he needs to go . \nIt begins with \u201can instrument.\u201d Within Article  9, \u201c\u2018Instrument\u2019 means a negotiable \ninstrument  or any other writing that evidences a right to the payment of a monetary \nobligation \u2026 and is of a type that in ordinary course of business is transferred by \ndelivery with any necessary indorsement or assignment .\u201d \u00a7 9-102(a)(47). A \u201c[n]egotia-\nble instrument \u201d is \u201can unconditional promise \u2026 to pay a fixed amount of money \u2026 at \na definite time.\u201d See \u00a7 9-102(b)  (incorporating the definition from \u00a7  3-104(a)) . So at \nleast under the first half of Corso\u2019s definition, th e promise must be unconditional, for \na fixed amount, and at a specified  time.  \nAs for the latter half, Corso has not addressed whether this contract would be \ntransferred in the ordinary course. And I will not go down the ordinary -course rabbit \nhole to make his argument for him. By all accounts, then, a \u201cpromissory note\u201d must \ninclude a definite promise, amount, and time.  \nContext confirms promissory notes\u2019 focus on definiteness . For instance, the six -\nyear statute of limitations applies to both \u201cpromissory note[s]\u201d and \u201cbill[s] of ex-\nchange.\u201d 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8109. Bills of exchange are similarly \u201cunconditional written or-\nder[s]\u201d from one party to  another to pay a third party  \u201ca specified sum \u2026 at a fixed or \nascertainable future time.\u201d Bill of Ex change , Black\u2019s Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019).  \nPlus, a different  six-year statute of limitations  applies  to notes \u201cpayable at a definite \ntime.\u201d 6 Del. C. \u00a7 3-118(a). \nThese contextual clues reflect sensible policy . True, one might think that breaches \nof definite contracts would be easier to discover and thus should have a shorter  \n11 limitations period. But Delaware law accomplishes two things. First, it encoura ges \nparties to reduce their agreements to concrete terms in a single document. Second, it \navoids evidentiary staleness. If the contract is complex and refers to things  beyond \nits four corners, there is a greater risk of relevant  evidence going  stale. But a  simple, \ndefinite contract needs little evidence beyond the contract itself. It is not absurd to \nread Delaware law  as prioritizing the latter  two concerns.  \nCorso\u2019s argument would undercut Delaware\u2019s policy . His argument boils down to \nthe idea t hat any written promise to pay money is a \u201cpromissory note\u201d that gets  a six -\nyear statute of limitations. But that would eat up the distinction between \u201cpromise\u201d \nand \u201cpromissory note,\u201d doubling the limitations period for almost all written  con-\ntracts . I decline to upset  Delaware courts\u2019 interpretations of Delaware law. So a \n\u201cpromissory note\u201d must include a definite promise, amount, and time.  \nC. Applying Delaware law to this contract  \nThis contract is not a promissory note. It is not (1)  an unconditional promise (2)  to \npay a fixed amount  (3) at a specified time. First, the contract include d \u201can express \ncondition to payment\u201d  and was \u201csubject to \u2026 another writing.\u201d 6 Del. C. \u00a7 3-106(a).  \nPrincipal payments were conditioned  on Complete Medical\u2019s  earning s. And the pay-\nments were  subject to  the indemnification provisions of the other  transaction agree-\nments.  Second, the amount was not fixed. Again, each principal payment  depended \non earnings. And the total principal was \u201cup to\u201d $4.2  million  or whatever Concordia \nhad paid by October 25, 2020 . Third, the payments  did not have a fixed timeframe. \nConcordia\u2019s obligations expired upon \u201cthe earlier of\u201d full payment  or October 25, 2020.  \n12 Even taking each installment as a separate promise , none was definite on the first \ntwo dimensions . \nFor the same reasons, Corso\u2019s backup argument applying the different  six-year \nlimitations period for a \u201cnote payable at a definite time\u201d also fails. \u00a7 3-118(a). Here, \n\u201cnote\u201d is a subset of \u201cinstrument.\u201d \u00a7  3-104(e). And \u201c\u2018[i]nstrument\u2019 means a negotiable \ninstrument.\u201d \u00a7  3-104(b); see also \u00a7 3-102(a) (applying that part of th e Delaware code to \nonly negotiable instruments ). Negotiable instruments are definite promises to pay \ndefinite amounts at definite time s. \u00a7 3-104(a).  As explained above, this contract was \nnot. So this six -year limitations period is also inapplicable . \nCorso has yet another fallback. He says that even if the principal payments were \nindefinite, the promise to pay interest was definite. True, that promise was not con-\nditioned on Complete Medical\u2019s  earnings. But it was  still subject to setoffs governed \nby a separate writing. It was also tied to the outstanding principal and would have \nrun out early if the principal was paid off before 2020.  So the promise to pay interest \nwas conditional, for an indefinite amount, and at an indefinite tim e. \nPlus,  it is unclear  whether a promise to pay interest alone could ever constitute a \npromissory note. Delaware  defines a \u201cnegotiable instrument \u201d as a  promise to pay a  \n\u201cfixed amount of money, with or without interest.\u201d \u00a7 3-104(a). One could plausibly \nread that definition to mean that interest is merely appended to a promissory note  \nand is not  a promissory note  in itself. In any event,  the whole contract here was an \nordinary  \u201cpromise, \u201d not a \u201cpromissory note, \u201d and the three -year statute of limitations \napplies.   \n13 D. There is no reason to toll the limitations period  \nCorso next argues  that even if the contract is not a promissory note, the statute of \nlimitations  should be tolled. Because Concordia \u201crepeatedly represented\u201d that it \nview ed the contract as a promissory note,  he says,  \u201c[i]t would be inequitable\u201d for Con-\ncordia to invoke the three -year statute of limitations. D.I.  53 at 13.  \nCorso bears the burden of justifying  tolling . Weinstein , 2022 WL 130973 , at *6 \u20137. \nHe asserts only equit able tolling, which requires \u201cwrongful self -dealing \u2026 where a \nplaintiff reasonably relies on the competence and good faith of a fiduciary.\u201d Id. at *8 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Concordia  was not Corso\u2019s fiduciary, and \nhe does not allege  self-dealing. So I will not toll the statute of limitations.  \nEven if  I broadly construed Corso\u2019s argument to include  estoppel , fraudulent con-\ncealment , or the like, it would still fail.  Concordia never affi rmatively represented \nthat the \u201c PROMISSORY NOTE \u201d was a \u201cpromissory note .\u201d Even in Corso\u2019s examples, \nConcordia  used  the term  just to refer to the agreement . See D.I. 53 at 9 \u201310, 13. A nd \nall but once , it capitalized \u201cPromissory Note\u201d to make that clear . Id.  \nConcordia never made a binding admission otherwise. Admissions are limited to \nquestions of fact. Blinder, Robinson & Co. v. Bruton , 552 A.2d 466, 474 (Del. 1989). \nBut t he meaning of \u201cpromissory note\u201d within a sta tute is a question of law.  Corso \npoints to no instance in which Concordia represented  that the contract was definite \nalong any of the three key dimensions.  So Concordia did not admit to any facts  relevant \nto whether the agreement was a \u201cpromissory note\u201d under Delaware  law.  \n14 E. The time -barred claims  \nUnder  the three -year statute of limitations, some but not all of Corso\u2019s claims are \ntime -barred. He filed his complaint in March 2021. Compl. , D.I. 1. In general,  install-\nment -payment claims accrue as the payments become  due. Worrel  v. Farmers Bank \nof State of Del. , 430 A.2d 469, 476 (Del. 1981) ; Bd. Of Trs. of Dist. No.  15 Machinists\u2019 \nPension Fund v. Kahle Eng\u2019g Corp. , 43 F.3d 852, 857 (3d Cir. 1994) . Because they \naccrued before March 2018, Corso\u2019s claims for the 2014, 2015, 2016, a nd 2017 pay-\nments are untimely. But his 2018, 2019, and 2020 claims clear this first hurdle . \n(Later, I will get to Corso\u2019s attempts to accelerate.)  \nCorso\u2019s implied -covenant claim is barred  too. It also has a three -year statute of \nlimitations. Lavender v. Koenig , 2017 WL 443696, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 1, 2017), \naff\u2019d, 171 A.3d 1117 (Del. 2017).  And it  accrued when Concordia supposedly bre ached. \nId.; Kahle , 43 F.3d at 857; 13 Williston on Contracts  \u00a7 39:12 (4th ed. 2022). According \nto Corso, Concordia breached the implied covenant when it dissolved Complete Med-\nical. See D.I. 46 at 14 \u201315; D.I. 53 at 17. That happened  in 2015. See D.I. 43 at 140, \n142. So this claim  is untimely.  \nThe excused -condition angle on Corso\u2019s  implied -covenant claim fares no better. \n(And because Complete Medical did not earn anything after 2015, this angle is his \nonly way  to recover principal.) Though he does not connect the dots, one could argue \nthat even if a claim for  breach is barred, the breach itself  could still have  excuse d the \nearnings condition s on the principal payments as they \u201cbec[a]me due .\u201d Restatement \n(Second) of Contrac ts \u00a7 245 cmt.  a. That conclusion could  mean that the claims for the \n2018, 2019, and 2020 principal payments were  timely.   \n15 Yet under the total -breach doctrine,  those claims  accrued  in 2016.  According to \nCorso, Complete Medical\u2019s dissolution excused the earnings condition on every later \nprincipal payment . The first of those payments was due in October 2016.  Concordia \ndid not pay then . And  a month later, it sent him a letter saying it would not make \nany future payments.  D.I. 43 at 142.  That  combination was a total breach . BioVeris \nCorp. v. Meso Scale Diagnos tics, LLC , 2017 WL 5035530, at *8 (Del. Ch. Nov. 2, 2017)  \n(\u201c[A]  breach by non -performance accompanied by or followed by a repudiation gives \nrise to a claim for damages for total breach .\u201d (quoting Restatement (Second)  of Con-\ntracts \u00a7  243(2)) ), aff\u2019d, 202 A.3d 509 (Del. 2019) . And a total breach \u201c triggers the stat-\nute of limitations for the entire contract. \u201d Id. at *9. So the three -year limitations pe-\nriod for the principal  payments began to run in late 2016 . Those claims are thus un-\ntimely . \nThis total -breach rule bars all  claims for principal , but not those for  interest. The \ninterest payments fall under an exception :  \nWhere at the time of the breach the only remaining duties of performance are \nthose of the party in breach and are for the payment of money in installments \nnot related to one another, his breach by non -performance as to less than the \nwhole [,] whether or not  accompanied or followed by a repudiation, does not give \nrise to a claim for damages for total breach.  \nId. at *10 (quoting Restatement (Second)  of Contracts \u00a7  243(3)).  \nThe only remaining duties were on Concordia (the purported ly breaching party ) \nto pay money in installments . And t he interest installments  were not related  to eac h \nother . In \u201cthe circumstances ,\u201d the failure to make one interest payment did not \u201csub-\nstantially affect [Corso\u2019s] expectation\u201d in future ones. Restatement (Second) of Con-\ntracts \u00a7  243(3) cmt.  c. So the lim itations period on the interest payment s began to run  \n16 as each one  came due , rather than upon Complete Medical\u2019s dissolution . Thus,  the \n2018, 2019, and 2020 interest -payment claims are still timely.  \nBy contrast, t he principal payments were related  and thus covered by the total -\nbreach rule . They  were all tied to Complete Medical\u2019s  earnings or, more to the point, \nexistence . See id. (explaining that payments can be related  through  \u201cthe requirement \nof the occurrence of a condition with respect to more than one of them \u201d). Though one  \ncould frame  each principal payment as having  its own earnings condition,  dissolving \nComplete Medical \u201c substantially affect [ed] [Corso\u2019s] expectation\u201d  in all future princi-\npal payments.  Id. Plus, the principal payments were related in another way:  if the \nearly ones were large enough  to pay off  all the  principal , the later ones would have \nvanished.  So these payments were related , and Corso\u2019s claims to them are untimely . \nOnce  the dust settles, only the claims for interest payments in 2018, 2019, and \n2020  remain . \nIII. CORSO RECOVER S THE LAST THREE INTEREST PAYMENTS  \nThe statute of limitations narrows  this case to the 2018, 2019, and 2020 interest \npayments. Though the partie s dispute whether these were subject to setoff, they do \nnot dispute the material facts underlying that disagreement . Because interpreting \nthe contract settles the dispute , it is fit for summary judgment.  \nA. The setoffs lasted until  October 2016  or 2017  \n1. Totaling the valid setoffs.  To determine whether Concordia owed Corso anything \nfor the last three  interest payments, I must first determine Concordia\u2019s setoffs. It is \nundisputed that Express  Scripts sent a $4.3  million \u201cDiscrepancy Evalua tion Report\u201d \nbut withheld  only $1.1 million . D.I. 43 at 192. It  stopped withholding once Concordia  \n17 got a new state license.  Id. On top of that $1.1  million, the parties also agree that \nCorso owed Concordia more than $1 00,000 for a lawsuit and nearly $30,00 0 for a \ndispute with another pharmaceutical company. Id. at 149, 192.  The exact amount s of \nthese smaller setoffs are disputed, but the potential difference of a few thousand dol-\nlars ends up not mattering here. All agree  that Concordia  was entitled to at least \n$1.2 million in setoffs. Id. \nAnd Concordia was entitled to nearly all that setoff amount  before Corso\u2019s first \npayment came due. Recall  that for Concordia to exercise its setoff right, it must have \nprovid ed notice and either reached an agreement with Corso or gotten a final judg-\nment fixing damages. Concordia asserts that \u201c\u2018Damages [were] agreed to\u2019 and the \nindemnification was fixed by early 2014.\u201d D.I.  41 at 21 (alteration in original). Corso \nconcedes that argument . He agrees that Concordia validly set off the payments from \n2014 through 2016.  D.I. 46 at 9 \u201311; D.I.  53 at 15 n.7 . At least some record evidence \nbacks up this point. D.I.  43 at 65, 67 \u201369, 80, 83. Though the 2014 agreement seemed \nto stipulate only to the $1.1  million, Corso had agreed to $1.2  million by November  \n2016 at the latest. D.I.  43 at 144. If the tim ing were otherwise, it might matter. But \nfor our purposes, we can think of Concordia as having $1.2  million in setoffs  begin-\nning in 2014 . \nConcordia argues that it should get to set off the full $4.3  million  discrepancy re-\nport. Not so. Under the setoff prov isions,  Corso \u201cwill indemnify\u201d Concordia for \u201call \nDamages which [Concordia] may incur or suffer\u201d from a specified set of potential  \nevents . D.I. 47 at 78 \u00a7 10.2. \u201cDamages\u201d were defined as \u201cany loss, damage, injury,  \n18 award, fine, penalty, Tax, fee or expen se.\u201d Id. at 31.  These terms all imply  actual  \ncosts \u2014not potential  ones. See Indemnify , Black\u2019s Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019) (\u201c To \nreimburse (another) for a loss suffered because of a third party \u2019s or one \u2019s own act or \ndefault .\u201d); Incur , Garner\u2019s Dictionary of Legal Usage (3d ed. 2011) (\u201c[T]o run into \n(some undesirable consequence) .\u201d); Suffer , Black\u2019s Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019) \n(\u201cTo experience or sustain \u2026 injury .\u201d).  \nThe same goes for Concordia\u2019s half -hearted attempt to invoke common -law setoff. \nAn \u201cunmatured obligation which is not presently enforceable cannot be the subject of \nset-off.\u201d 80 C.J.S. Set-off and Counterclaim  \u00a7 5; see also generally  TIFD III -X LLC v. \nFruehauf Prod. Co. , 883 A.2d 854  (Del. Ch. 2004) (citing C.J.S. Set-off and Counter-\nclaim  approvingly ). So, in all,  Concordia was entitled to just $1.2 million in setoffs.  \n2. Concordia\u2019s withholdings.  Concordia used these setoffs . In October 2014, Corso \nwas entitled to $480,000 of principal plus $252,000 in interest. But Concordia validly \nexercised its right to \u201cwithhold and set off\u201d those  amount s. So after 2014, $3,720,000 \nremained on the  principal  balance . At the 6% interest rate, each subsequent interest \npayment  was supposed to be $223,200. And Concordia had about $468,000 remaining \nin setoffs  ($1.2  million  \u2013 $480,000  \u2013 $252,000  = $468,000) . In October 2015, Concor-\ndia again validly set off the $223,200 interest payment . Corso concedes  that Concor-\ndia owed no principal that year.  So up to at least October 2016, Concordia had enough  \nsetoffs to cover everything it owed.  \nWhen the October 2016 payment came due , Concordia\u2019s setoffs reservoir  was down \nto about  $244,800  (or $144,800 if Corso had by then agreed  to only $1.1  million ).  \n19 Concordia again set off  $223,200 in interest . So it had roughly $21,600 in setoffs re-\nmaining  (or it  had exceeded its setoffs) . Any remaining amount was then depleted in \nOctober 2016 or 2017. If Corso is right that the earnings condition was excused for \nall principal pa yments after Complete Medical\u2019s dissolution, then Concordia would \nhave owed an October 2016 principal payment , exceeding  any remaining setoffs . \n(Though his  prevention claims  are untimely, prevention could still mean that  Con-\ncordia ow ed principal in 2016, counting  against its setoffs.)  If Corso is wrong about \npost-dissolution principal payments, Concordia still would have  owed another \n$223,200 in interest in October 2017. So Concordia\u2019s obligations exceeded its setoffs by \nOctober 2016 at the earliest or October 2017 at the latest . Thus, it owed the full amount \nof the 2018 , 2019, and 2020 interest payments (the only timely claims),  totaling \n$669,600 . \nConcordia  does not contest Corso\u2019s inte rest calculations or that interest payments \nwere due even when principal payments were not. Instead, it tries to stitch together \nits setoffs and  the statute of limitations. It says that the pre -2018 claims are barred \nby the statute of limitations anyway, s o I should apply its setoffs to the remaining \n$669,600. That argument simply ignores how events unfolded . The contract gives \nConcordia \u201cthe right to withhold and set off against any amount due hereunder.\u201d \nD.I. 1-1 \u00a7 1.4. Concordia  exercised that right  each  year. And it told Corso that it was \ndoing so . See, e.g. , D.I. 43 at 67 \u201369, 146\u201347. If Corso had tried to sue in 2015, he would \nhave lost because Concordia  simply  would have pointed to its setoffs. Now that Corso \nsues for the payments after those setoffs ran out, Concordia cannot create a   \n20 convenient patchwork of time -barred and set -off claims . Cf. Genencor Int\u2019l, Inc. v. \nNovo Nordisk A/S , 766 A.2d 8, 12 \u201313 (Del. 20 00) (explaining equitable estoppel) . \nB. Corso never accelerated the contract  \nConcordia is not through with the statute of limit ations . \u201cIt is undisputed,\u201d Con-\ncordia says, \u201cthat Corso sent letters alleging default and purportedly  accelerating the \n\u2018Promissory Note\u2019 on March 31, 2015, June 3, 2016, and in late 2017.\u201d D.I. 59 at 11. \nThe issue  is whether those \u201cpurported []\u201d accelerations had any legal effect. If they \ndid, then Corso\u2019s whole claim is barred : upon acceleration, t he statute of limitations \nbegins to run for the whole contract . 12 Am. Jur. 2d \u00a7  570; Worrel , 430 A.2d at 476 . \nBut Corso  never accelerated the contract \u2014despite his best efforts . Take it  step by \nstep. First, go back to the contract. It says that Corso \u201cmay \u2026 by written notice to \n[Concordia], declare the entire\u201d amount  due \u201c[u]pon the occurrence of an Event of \nDefault.\u201d D.I. 1-1 \u00a7 2.3. And the relevant  \u201cEvent of Default\u201d is Concordia\u2019s  failure \u201cto \npay any amount of principal or interest due under this Note.\u201d \u00a7 2.1(c).  So Corso had \nthe power to accelerate only if Concordia first failed to  pay an amount that was due, \nnot merely if it declare d that it would not pay . \nNow return  to Corso\u2019s accel eration attempts . In March 2015 and June 2016, his \nlawyer sent letters declaring that  \u201cmy client exercises  his right \u2026 to declare the en-\ntire\u201d contract due. D.I. 43 at 122  (emphasis added);  accord  id. at 140. But the setoffs \ngave Concordia the right to \u201cwithhold \u2026 any amount due \u201d in October 2014 and 2015.  \nD.I. 1-1 \u00a7 1.4. So, by June 2016 , it had not \u201cfail [ed] \u2026 to pay any amount \u2026 due under \nth[e] Note .\u201d \u00a7 2.1(c).  Thus, Corso  had no power to accelerate.   \n21 And in his later letters he did not assert  his accelerat ion right . The 2017  and 2020  \nletter s were conditional . They said he \u201cwill\u201d declare the full amount due . D.I. 47 at \n22. But nothing in the record shows  that Corso did exercise  that right. So even though \nCorso had the power to accelerate in October 2016 or 2017, he did not exercise it.  \nThus, Corso\u2019s  claims for 2018, 2019, and 2020 interest  payments  are (1) timely , \nbecause Corso did not accelerate them  and (2)  successful , because Concordia ran out \nof setoffs in October 2017 at the latest . \nC. Corso is not owed  any principal  \nFinally, Corso argues that the contract unconditionally require d Concordia to pay \nthe full principal  amount by October 25, 2020. That argument borders on  frivolous. \nThe contract clearly contemplate d a world in which Corso got no princip al paym ents. \nIt sa id Corso would receive \u201cup to\u201d $4.2  million,  depending  Complete Medical \u2019s per-\nform ance , and it set  the 2020  deadline as an alternative to Corso\u2019s \u201cbeing paid in full .\u201d \nD.I. 1-1 at 2, \u00a7 1.1 That deadline came and went. Corso is not entitled to more.  \n* * * * * \nPutting the pieces together, Corso is owed $669,600 for the 2018, 2019, and 2020  \ninterest payments . Principal and interest payments from 2014 and 2015  were validly \nset off  and are time -barred  anyway . And though Concordia \u2019s setoffs came up short  in \n2016 or  2017, Corso\u2019s claim s to that money are also untimely. The same goes for his  \nimplied -covenant claim . Yet he did not effectively accelerate after Conco rdia was in  \ndefault, so his later claims are not barred. Thus, Corso recover s $669,600, but no \nmore . "}
