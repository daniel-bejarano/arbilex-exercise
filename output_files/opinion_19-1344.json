Andrews  \nANDREWS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \n Pending before the Court are Petitioner Aaron Purnell\u2019s  Petition for a Writ of Habeas \nCorpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Amended Petition , and a Memorandum in Support  \n(collectively referred to as \u201cPetition\u201d).  (D.I. 2; D.I. 12; D.I. 16 )  The State filed an Answer in \nopposition.  (D.I. 20)   For the reasons discussed, the Court will dismiss  the Petition .   \nI.   BACKGROUND \n[Petitioner]  was arrested on July 28, 2016, in connection with a \nshooting incident which had occurred at Alder Park Apartments south of Dover on July 24, 2016. On that date, Corporal Edwin Justiniano (\u201cCpl. Justiniano\u201d) of the Delaware State Police responded to a complaint that a man had pushed a woman in the commons area outside one of the apartment buildings and had displayed a firearm. Upon arriving at Alder Park Apartments at approximately 8:20 p.m., Cpl. Justiniano saw [Petitioner]  in the area \nwhere the complaint had been reported; he could see that [Petitioner]  \nappeared to match the description of the assailant. Cpl. Justiniano told [Petitioner]  to \u201ccome over here,\u201d at which point [Petitioner]  and \nanother individual who was in the area fled on foot behind one of \nthe nearby apartment buildings. Cpl. Justiniano, who was alone, gave chase. The second individual soon veered off and ran in a different direction from [Petitioner] . Cpl. Justinano chose to let that \nperson go and continued t o chase [Petitioner] . \n \nAs Cpl. Justiniano pursued [Petitioner]  behind the building, \n[Petitioner]  turned and fired a shot at him from a distance of about \n15 or 20 feet.  Luckily, the shot missed.  Cpl. Justiniano immediately \nreturned fire  but his shots also missed.  He continued to follow the \nfleeing [Petitioner] , who took a circuitous route but was eventually \nfound in a bush in a nearby backyard.  Police located a 9 mm pistol \nin the bush; this firearm was later determined to have fired a 9 mm shell casing found at the scene of the shooting.  When the shooting \noccurred, it was not yet dark; for this reason, Cpl. Justiano was easily able to identify [Petitioner]  as the person who tried to shoot him. \nCpl. Justiniano's motor vehicle recorder w as operating at the time of \nthe incident and preserved an audio recording of Cpl. Justiniano's initial verbal interactions with [Petitioner]  and of the shots which \nwere fi red.  The incident occurred out of range of the camera so there \nwas no visual recordi ng. 2 \n  \nState v. Purnell , 2018 WL 5733672, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 31, 2018) .  \n On June 19, 2017, Petitioner pled guilty  in the Delaware Superior Court  to attempted first \ndegree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (\u201cPFDCF\u201d ).  (D.I. \n21-1 at  Entry No. 28)  The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to an aggregate twenty- eight \nyears of incarceration.   (D.I. 21- 6)  Petitioner did not appeal his convictions.  \n In July 2017, Petitioner filed a motion for modification of sentence, which the Superior \nCourt denied on September 11, 2017.  (D.I. 21- 7; D.I. 21-9) \n In April  2018, Petitioner filed a pro se  motion for post -conviction relief purs uant to \nDelaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d) .  (D.I. 21- 1 at Entry No. 33;  D.I. \n21-10)  A Superior Court Commissioner issued a report recommending the denial of the Rule 61 \nmotion.   (D.I. 21 -13); Purnell , 2018 WL 5733672, at *4.  The Superior Court adopted the \nReport and Recommendation and denied the Rule 61 motion on January 23, 2019.  (D.1. 21- 16); \nState v. Purnell , 2019 WL 328560, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 23, 2019).  Petitioner appealed, but \nthe Delaware Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as untimely.  (D.I. 21- 5); Purnell v. State , 208 \nA.3d 355 (Table), 2019 WL 1494631 (Del. Apr. 2, 2019).  II. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES  \nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  \nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ( \u201cAEDPA\u201d ) \n\u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences . . . and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d  Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003).  Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas  petition filed by a state prisoner only 3 \n \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the \nUnited States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).  Additionally, AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for analyzing the merits of a habeas petition  in order to \u201cprevent federal habeas \n\u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure that state -court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under \nlaw.\u201d  Bell v. Cone , 535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002).  \nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default  \nAbsen t exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the  \npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law.  See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); \nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel , 526 U.S. 838, 842- 44 (1999);  Picard v. Connor , 404 U.S. 270, 275 \n(1971).  The AEDPA states, in pertinent part:  \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in \ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be \ngranted unless it appears that \u2013 \n \n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts                       of the State; or  \n \n(B)(i)  there is an absence of available State corrective process; or  \n(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of th e applicant. \n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).   \nThe exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to \ngive \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one \ncomplete round of the St ate\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d  O\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at \n844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000) .  A petitioner satisfies the \nexhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the habeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct appeal or in a post -conviction proceeding, in a procedural 4 \n manner permitting the court to consider the claims on their merits .  See Bell  v. Cone , 543 U.S. \n447, 451 n.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989) .  A federal legal claim is \n\u201cfairly presented\u201d to state courts when there is: \u201c (1) reliance on pertinent federal cases \nemploying constitutional analysis; (2) reliance on state cases employing constitutional analysis in \nlike fact situations; (3) assertion of the claim in terms so particular as to call to mind a specific right protected by the Constitution; [or]  (4) allegation of a pattern of facts that is well within the \nmainstream of constitutional litigation. \u201d  McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 261 (3d Cir. \n1999).  A petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused if state procedural rules \npreclude him from seeking further relief in state courts.  See Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 \n(3d Cir. 2000); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 297- 98 (1989) .  Although treated as technically \nexhausted, such claims are nonetheless procedurally defaulted.  See  Lines, 208 F.3d at 160; \nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750- 51 (1991).  Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas \nclaim to the state\u2019s highest cour t, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the \nmerits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted.  See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed , 489 U.S. \n255, 260- 64 (1989).   \n Federal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the \npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice wi ll result if the court does not review the \nclaims.  See McCandless, 172 F.3d at  260; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750- 51.  To demonstrate cause \nfor a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor external to the 5 \n defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d  Murray v. \nCarrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986).  To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show \u201cthat [the errors at trial] worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d  Id. at 494.  \n Alternatively, a federal court may excuse a procedural default if the petitioner \ndemonstrates that failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  See Edwards v . Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d \nCir. 2001).  A petitioner demonstrates a miscarriage of justice by showing a \u201cconstitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d   Murray, 477 \nU.S. at 496.  Actual innocence means factual innocence, not legal insufficiency.  See Bousley v. United States , 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998).  In order to establish actual innocence, the petitioner \nmust present new reliable evidence \u2013 not presented at trial \u2013  that demonstrates \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d  House v. Bell , 547 U.S. 518, 537- 38 (2006); see Sweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 522- 24 (3d \nCir. 2002).  \nIII.   DISCUSSION  \nPetitioner \u2019s timely filed Petition  assert s the following six  Claims: (1) defense counsel  \nprovided ineffective assistance by engaging in \u201cfraudulent tactics and [employing] deceitful measures\u201d in order to convince Petitioner to plead guilty  (D.I. 16 at 5) ; (2) the Superior Court  \nviolated Petitioner\u2019s  Sixth Amendment rights by denying his request for new counsel and \nessentially forcing him to represent himself or keep defense counsel who was prejudiced against him ( id. at 7 ); (3) the State violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)  by not informing 6 \n Petitioner about the misconduct of the State\u2019s firearm expert, Carl Rone ( id. at 8 ); (4) the manner \nin which the Superior Court conducted Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 proceeding amounted to an abuse of \ndiscretion ( id. at 10) ; (5) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a \nmotion to suppress the evidence obtained during Petitioner\u2019s initial encounter with the police  (id. \nat 20); and (6) the State violated Brady  becaus e the police failed to collect and preserve video \nsurveillance ( id. at 25 -27).    \nThe record reveals that Petitioner did not exhaust state remedies for any of the Claims in \nhis Petition.   Petitioner did not file a direct appea l.  And, although Petitioner included Claims \nOne, Two, Three, and Five in his Rule 61 motion and subsequent ly appealed the Superior \nCourt\u2019s denial of those Claims,   the Delaware Supreme Court dismissed his Rule 61 appeal as untimely .  This procedural history demonstrates t hat Petitioner did not fairly present the instant \nsix Claims  to the Delaware Supreme Court  in a manner permitting that court to consider the \nClaims on their merits .   \nAt this juncture, if  Petitioner  tried  to present Claims One through Six in a new Rule 61 \nmotion , the motion would be barred as untimely  under Rule 61(i)(1)  and barred as successive \nunder Rule 61(i)(2) .  See Trice v. Pierce, 2016 WL 2771123, at * 4 (D. Del. May 13, 2016); Del. \nSuper. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(2) (barring second or successive motions unless certain pleading requirements are satisfied).   Although Rule 61(i)(1) provides for an exception to the one -year \ntime limitation if the untimely Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a retroactively applicable right that is newly recognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\u201d no such right is implicated in the \ninstant argument.  Similarly, the exceptions to Rule 61(i)(1)\u2019s time -bar and 61(i)(2)\u2019s successive \nbar contained in Rule 61(i)(5) and (d)(2) do not apply to Petit ioner\u2019s case, because he does not 7 \n allege a credible claim of actual innocence, lack of jurisdiction, or that a new rule of \nconstitutional law applies to the instant argument.   Given these circumstances, the Court must \ntreat Claims One through Six as exhaus ted but procedurally defaulted, meaning that the Court \ncannot review the merits of the Claims  absent a showing of cause -and-prejudice or a miscarriage \nof justice.  \nPetitioner  does not attempt to establish cause for his default of Claims One through Six.  \nPetitioner\u2019s failure to establish cause eliminates the need to address prejudice.  In addition, t he \nmiscarriage of justice exception to the procedural default doctrine does not apply to excuse \nPetitioner\u2019s default, because he has not provided any new reliable evidence of his actual innocence.  Accordingly, the Court will den y Claims One through Six a s procedurally barred \nfrom habeas review.  \nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY  \n A district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether \nto issue a certificate of appealability.  See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).   A certificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitut ional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the \ndistrict court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2253(c)(2);  Slack v. McDaniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).  Additionally, when a district court \ndenies a habeas claim or petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the petition 8 \n states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in \nits procedural ruling.  See Slack , 529 U.S. at  484.   \n The Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant re lief.  Reasonable \njurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable.  Accordingly, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.  \nV. CONCLUSION \n For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the Petition without holding an evidentiary \nheari ng.   \nAn appropriate Order will be entered.  \n  "}
