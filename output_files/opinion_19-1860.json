INTRODUCTION\n\nPresently before the court in this civil rights action alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1983 is a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed by Defendant, Casey L. Breidigan,\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (the \u201cMotion\u201d) seeking dismissal of Plaintiff\nCathy Jones\u2019 loss of consortium claim (Count II) of the Complaint and dismissal of the\nunidentified defendants John/Jane Does 1-10.! (D.I. 37) Plaintiffs, Marie Gray and Cathy Jones,\ndo not oppose dismissal of the Doe Defendants but oppose dismissal of the loss of consortium\nclaim. For the following reasons, the court recommends GRANTING-IN-PART and\nDENYING-IN-PART Defendant\u2019s Motion.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThis case arises out of alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 during a welfare check\nperformed by Defendant Breidigan, a Delaware State Trooper, on Plaintiff Gray on October 15,\n2017. (D.I. 1 at (5, 7, 10) Plaintiffs allege that Gray\u2019s son, Thomas, called the Delaware State\nPolice and told them Gray was suicidal after a dispute regarding Gray\u2019s intention to remove him\n\n' The briefing for the Motion is as follows: Defendant\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 38), Plaintiffs\u2019\nanswering brief (D.I. 39), and Defendant\u2019s reply brief (D.I. 40).\nfrom her will. (id. at {{ 8-9) They further allege that Breidigan forcefully entered their home\nand proceeded to their bedroom where she demanded Gray come with her to undergo a\npsychiatric evaluation. (/d. at J] 12-13) Plaintiffs claim that, after Gray protested leaving,\nBreidigan forcibly removed her from her home and physically assaulted her. (/d. at Jf 19, 21,\n23-24, 26)\n\nOn October 3, 2019, Plaintiffs Gray and Jones filed their Complaint asserting claims\nagainst Defendants Breidigan and John/Jane Does 1-10 alleging excessive force/assault and\nbattery in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Count I) and loss of consortium (Count II). (/d. at {J\n3441) Plaintiff Jones\u2019 derivative loss of consortium claim alleges that, as a result of\nDefendant\u2019s conduct, she has been deprived of the love, support, comfort, care and other services\nof her wife. (/d. at 41).\n\nPlaintiff Jones was deposed on December 8, 2021. (D.I. 38, Ex. E) In her deposition,\ndefense counsel asked Jones to explain: \u201cWhat...services or things that [Gray] did for you that\nshe can no longer do for you as a result of this incident?\u201d (/d. at 56:17-20) Jones responded,\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that she wasn\u2019t able to be herself after that. For four years we lived in hell and fear. We\nwere constantly looking behind our back.\u201d (/d. at 56:21-24) When asked whether there was\n\u201canything else,\u201d Jones stated, \u201cJust that we were living in fear for...these four years that have\ngone by, mainly fear of policemen.\u201d (/d. at 57:14)\n\nOn November 30, 2022, Defendant Breidigan filed the present Motion seeking summary\njudgment on Plaintiff Jones\u2019 loss of consortium claim and dismissal of the John/Jane Doe 1-10\nDefendants. (D.I. 38)\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those that could affect the outcome of the proceeding, and \u201ca\ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury\nto return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.\n2011) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)); see Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).\n\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely disputed\nmaterial fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The burden then shifts to the non-movant to\ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial, and the court must view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458,\n460-61 (3d Cir. 1989); Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). An assertion of whether or not\na fact is genuinely disputed must be supported either by citing to \u201cparticular parts of materials in\nthe record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or\ndeclarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions,\ninterrogatory answers, or other materials,\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do not\nestablish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce\nadmissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B).\n\nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdo more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586. The \u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not\ndefeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;\u201d rather, there must be\n\nenough evidence to enable a jury to reasonably find for the non-moving party on the issue. See\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 247-49 (emphasis in original). \u201cIf the evidence is merely colorable, or is\nnot significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d Jd. at 249-50 (internal citations\nomitted); see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. If the non-movant fails to make a sufficient showing\non an essential element of its case on which it bears the burden of proof, then the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.\n\nIf a party fails to address another party\u2019s assertion of fact, the court may consider the fact\nundisputed, or grant summary judgment if the facts show. that the movant is entitled to it. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(e)(2)+(3).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nDefendant\u2019s Motion seeks summary judgment on Jones\u2019 loss of consortium claim and\ndismissal of John/Jane Doe 1-10 Defendants. Because Defendant Breidigan has failed to prove\nthe absence of a factual dispute regarding Plaintiff Jones\u2019 loss of consortium claim, the court\nrecommends denying Defendant\u2019s Motion with respect to that claim. Since Plaintiffs do not\noppose the dismissal of John/Jane Doe 1-10 Defendants, the court recommends granting\nDefendant\u2019s Motion and dismissing the unidentified Defendants.\n\nA. Plaintiff Jones\u2019 Loss of Consortium Claim\n\nPlaintiff Jones\u2019 derivative claim is contingent on whether there is direct evidence upon\nwhich a trier of fact could reasonably find that Jones has satisfied the elements of a loss of\nconsortium claim. Under Delaware law, the elements of a loss of consortium claim are: (1) that\nthe party asserting the cause of action was married to the person who suffered physical injury at\nthe time the injury occurred, (2) that the spouse suffered injury which deprived the other spouse\nof some benefit which formerly existed in the marriage, and (3) that the injured spouse has a\n\nvalid cause of action against the tortfeasor. Nieves v. Acme Markets, Inc., 541 F. Supp. 2d 600,\n612 (D. Del. 2008); see also Lacy v. G.D. Searle & Co., 484 A.2d 527, 532 (Del. Super. Ct.\n1984). A loss of consortium claim is generally premised on evidence of loss of society,\ncompanionship, affection, and sexual relations but may include many other facets of a marital\nrelationship. Lacy, 484 A.2d at 532.\n\nDefendant Breidigan does not concede that Plaintiff Jones has met element three but\nchoose not to argue it as she is not seeking summary judgment on Plaintiff Gray\u2019s underlying tort\nclaim. (D.I. 38 at 6 n.3). Accordingly, the court will presume element three is satisfied for\npurposes of the pending Motion and will only address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the first\ntwo elements.\n\n1. Married at the time of injury\n\nDefendant Breidigan argues that she sought discovery regarding documentation of the\nPlaintiffs\u2019 marital status, but that Plaintiffs did not provide any evidence that Gray and Jones\nwere married at the time of the incident. (D.I. 38 at 6) Plaintiffs attach a photocopy of their\nmarriage certificate dated October 27, 2015, to confirm they were married at the time of the\nincident which occurred on October 15, 2017. (D.I. 39, Ex. A; D.I. 1 at 97) Defendant\nBreidigan has not challenged the certificate\u2019s authenticity or asserted any argument in her reply\nbrief as to why the court should not consider it prima facie evidence in satisfaction of the first\nelement of a loss of consortium claim. (See D.I. 40)\n\nDefendant Breidigan fails to cite in the record any support for her statement that she\npreviously requested discovery on the Plaintiffs\u2019 marital status. Defendant Breidigan attached a\nfull set of interrogatories served on Plaintiffs along with their responses without directing the\ncourt to a specific numbered interrogatory that asks for proof of marital status such as a marriage\n\ncertificate or license. (See D.I. 38, Exs. C-D) Moreover, Defendant Breidigan attached each\nPlaintiff's complete deposition transcript without citing to page and line numbers where any\nquestions were posed about their marital status and/or proof of it. (See id, Exs. A, E) Only two\nquestions were asked of Plaintiff Jones relating to the loss of consortium claim and those\nquestions did not challenge or seek to elicit a response to the threshold question of whether\nPlaintiffs were officially married at the time of the incident. (d., Ex. E at 56:17\u201420; 57:1)\nDefendant\u2019s failure to pursue discovery on the Plaintiffs\u2019 official marital status does not create a\nbasis to move for summary judgment on the issue. Therefore, the court recommends the first\nelement for a loss of consortium claim has been satisfied.\n\n2. Loss of a pre-existing marital benefit\n\nHaving found the Plaintiffs established they were married at the time of the incident, the\ncourt recommends finding that there are disputed facts regarding the second element of a loss of\nconsortium claim (i.e. that Plaintiff Jones was deprived of some benefit which formerly existed\nin the marriage) which cannot be resolved on summary judgment.\n\nDefendant Breidigan argues that Jones\u2019 deposition testimony does not establish her loss\nof any marital benefit that she previously enjoyed. (D.I. 38 at 7-8) When asked to state,\n\u201cWhat...services or things that [Gray] did for you that she can no longer do for you as a result of\nthis incident?\u201d Jones replied that \u201c[Gray] wasn\u2019t able to be herself after that. For four years we\nlived in hell and fear. We were constantly looking behind our back.\u201d (D.J. 38, Ex. E at 56:17\u2014\n24) After defense counsel inquired if there was \u201canything else,\u201d Jones reiterated that they were\nliving in fear of policemen. (/d. at 57:14) Defendant argues this is insufficient evidence to\nsupport a loss of consortium claim.\n\nIn response, Plaintiffs supplied an affidavit, dated December 15, 2022, wherein Jones\n\ndeclares that she and Gray have only had sexual relations on a singular occasion since the\nincident, that Gray is \u201cno longer affectionate, fun-loving, or spontaneous\u201d and that they have\n\u201conly gone to the beach on three occasions\u201d and \u201cno longer ride bikes or travel.\u201d (D.I. 39, Ex. B\nat \u00a7{ 7-12) Defendant argues that Jones\u2019 affidavit is a \u201csham\u201d as it was provided only after\nDefendant filed the present Motion, and therefore, should be disregarded under the Third\nCircuit\u2019s \u201csham affidavit doctrine.\u201d (D.I. 40 at 2-4)\n\nThe court recommends finding that Jones\u2019 affidavit is not a sham because the affidavit\ndoes not dispute or contradict Jones\u2019 prior deposition testimony. It provides additional\ninformation to support Jones\u2019 loss of consortium claim concerning the effects of Gray\u2019s injuries\non their marital relationship. (See D.I. 39, Ex. B at {J 7, 10-12) Cf Hackman v. Valley Fair,\n932 F. 2d 239, 240-41 (3d Cir. 1991) (finding the affidavit was a sham because it contradicted a\ndate the plaintiff had provided in his deposition which, if unchanged, would have barred his\nclaim under the statute of limitations).\n\nRegardless of whether the court considers Plaintiff Jones\u2019 affidavit self-serving, her\ndeposition testimony is sufficient to establish a material factual dispute. While Defendant\nBreidigan asserts there is a lack of evidence demonstrating that Plaintiff Jones suffered a loss of\na pre-existing martial benefit, the alleged lack of evidence stems from Defendant\u2019s own failure to\npursue discovery targeted to a loss of consortium claim. The Third Circuit has noted that the\nsham affidavit doctrine may come into play to prevent \u201ca party who has been examined at length\non deposition\u201d from raising an issue of fact in an affidavit to preclude summary judgment. Baer\nv. Chase, 392 F.3d 609, 624 (3d. Cir. 2004) (quoting Perma Rsch. & Dev. Co. v. Singer Co., 410\nF.2d 572, 578 (2d Cir. 1969)) (emphasis added). The court does not find that Jones was\nexamined at length. Defense counsel asked Jones only two questions related to her loss of\n\nconsortium claim. (D.I. 38, Ex. E at 56:17-\u201420; 57:1) Defendant did not follow up with\nquestions tailored to discover evidence to support this element. Therefore, the court\nrecommends finding a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff Jones\u2019 was\ndeprived of a pre-existing marital benefit precluding summary judgment.\n\nB. Dismissal of John/Jane Doe 1-10 Defendants\n\nPlaintiffs do not oppose Defendant\u2019s Motion with regards to the dismissal of John/Jane\nDoe 1-10 Defendants. (D.I. 39 at 1). Accordingly, the court recommends dismissal of all\nJohn/Jane Doe 1-10 Defendants whom Plaintiffs have failed to identify after reasonable\nopportunity for discovery. See Blakeslee v. Clinton Cty., 336 F. App\u2019x 248, 250-51 (3d Cir.\n2009); Fed. R. Civ. P. 21 (\u201cOn motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms,\nadd or drop a party.\u201d).\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court recommends GRANTING-IN-PART Defendant\u2019s\nMotion with respect to dismissing John/Jane Does 1-10 and DENYING-IN-PART with respect\nto Plaintiff Jones\u2019 loss of consortium claim (Count I). (D.I. 37)\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).
