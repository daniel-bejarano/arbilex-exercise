{"case_name": "BoardActive Corporation v. Foursquare Labs, Inc.", "case_number": "22-597", "judge": "Judge Joshua D. Wolson", "date": "03-21-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \n   Case No. 1:22 -cv-00597- JDW  \n     \n      \nMEMORANDUM  \n \nNot everyone is as receptive to a billboard advertisement as Homer Simpson on \nNew Billboard  Day.1 To make billboards more effective when targeting the rest of us, \nBoardActive Corporation patented an approach to digital advertisement based on \nconsumers \u2019 proximity to billboar ds and the direction of their travel, among other things. \nHowever, three of those patents are directed to a common and abstract idea: targeted \ndigital marketing. Those patents are therefore invalid. Other companies , including \nFoursquare Labs, Inc.,  can therefore use the same technology to persuade us all to surprise \nour families and go to clown college  (including but not limited to Princeton) .2 \n \n1 See The Simpsons: Homie The Clown (Fox television broadcast Feb. 12, 1995).  \n2 Compare id. (\u201cyou people have held me back long enough, I\u2019m going to clown \ncollege!\u201d) with The Simpsons: Brother From Another Series (Fox television broadcast Feb. \n23, 1997) (\u201c \u2018four years at clown college \u2019 \u2026 \u2018I\u2019d thank you not to refer to Princeton that \nway.\u2019\u201d).    \nBOARDACTIVE CORPORATION ,  \n   \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n FOURSQUARE LABS, INC. ,  \n   \nDefendant . \n 2 \n \n I. BACKGROUND  \nBoardActive  alleges  that Foursquare infring es five of its patents : (a) U.S. Patent No. \n10,521,822 (the \u2018822 Patent) ; (b) U.S. Patent No. 10,621,620 (the \u2018620 Patent) ; (c) U.S. \nPatent No. 10,621,621 (the \u2018621 Patent) ; (d) U.S. Patent No. 10,685,380 (the \u2018380 Patent) ; \nand (e) U.S. Patent No. 10,692,108 (the \u2018 108 Patent) . These patents are part of the same \npatent family , which provide s a \u201cplatform for location and time based advertising.\u201d They \nclaim method s and system s for determining  course of travel based on at least two \ngeolocation indications, associating content with delivery conditions , including course of \ntravel , and transmitting content when the delivery conditions are met.  The \u2018822 Patent is \nthe parent patent with two child patent branches . One branch consists of the \u2018621 and \n\u2018380 Patents. Th e \u2018621 Patent is a continuation of \u2018822 Patent and the \u2018380 Patent is a \ncontinuation of the \u2018621 Patent. Both  are subject to terminal disclaimers. The second \nbranch consists of the  \u2018620 and \u2018108 Patents.  The \u2018620 Patent is a partial continuation of \nthe \u2018822 Paten t and the \u2018108 Patent is a continuation of the \u2018620 Patent.  The \u2018620 Patent \nis not subject to a terminal disclaimer , but the \u2018108 Patent is, in light of the \u2018620 Patent.  \nFoursquare has moved to dismiss. It argu es that the a sserted patents may all be \nrepresented by Claim 1 of the \u2018380 Patent and they are all invalid under Section 101. \nBoardActive disagrees. The Motion is ripe for disposition . 3 \n \n II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA district court may dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted. See FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). The Federal Circuit applies regional circuit \nlaw to procedural questions that are not themselves substantive patent law issues so long \nas they do not (A) pertain to patent law, (B) bear an essential relationship to matters committed to the Federal Circuit\u2019s exclusive control by statute, or (C) implicate the jurisprudential responsibilities of the Federal Circuit in a field within its exclusive jurisdiction. \nSee GFI, Inc. v. Franklin Corp. , 265 F.3d 1268, 1272 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Thus, I \napply Third Circuit law with respect to the motion to dismiss. See Aatrix Software, Inc. v. \nGreenShades Software, Inc. , 882 F.3d 1121, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 2018) . \n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d  Connelly v. Lane \nConst. Corp. , 809 F.3d 780, 786 (3d Cir. 2016) . The Third Circuit has a three -step process \nto determine whether a complaint meets th is standard. First, the court must identify the \nelements needed to state  a particular claim. See i d. at 787. Second, the court should \nidentify conclusory allegations, such as legal conclusions, that are not entitled to the presumption of truth. \nSee i d. Third , the court should accept as true well -pleaded \nallegations and \u201cdetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d \nSee i d. The court must \u201cconstrue those truths in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, \nand then draw all reasonabl e inferences from them.\u201d Id. at 790.  4 \n \n A defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff has not stated a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted. See FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b). In deciding a motion to \ndismiss, the court must \u201cdraw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d  Ashcroft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Representative Claim  \nFoursquare argues that C laim 1 of the \u2018380 Patent is representative of all the \nasserted patent claims . The Federal Circuit has held that a court may treat a patent claim \nas representative of other s when the claims are \u201csubstantially similar and linked to the \nsame abstract idea.\u201d  Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat. \nAss'n , 776 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Where representativeness is contested, \npatentee s bear the burden of making a \u201cmeaningful argument for the distinctive \nsignificance of any claim limitations not found in the representative claim .\u201d Berkheimer v. \nHP Inc. , 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Claim language is the primary consideration \nin determining if a claim is representative. See Cleveland Clinic Foundation v. True Health \nDiagnostics , LLC, No. 15 -cv-2331, 2016 WL 705244, at *3 (N.D. Ohio February 23, 2016)  \n(analyzing claim language to find patent claim representative),  aff\u2019d, 859 F.3d 1352, 1360 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017).  \nBoardActive argues that Claim 1 of the \u2018822 Patent is a better representative claim \nthan Claim 1 of the \u2018380 Patent, and I agree . Claim 1 of the \u2018822 Patent is substantially 5 \n \n similar to the cla ims in the \u2019822,  \u2019621, and \u2019380 Patents. All claims describe a process of \nidentifying a first and second location based on device signal and delivering content when \ncertain conditions are met ( e.g., course of travel, time of travel). The independent claims \nof the \u2018822 and \u2018621 Patents are nearly ide ntical. (Compare  \u2018822 Patent, Claim 13 with \u2018621 \nPatent, Claim 13. ) Where d ifferences exist between  the independent claims, such as the \naddition of unspecified consumer characteristics ( see, e.g. , \u2018380 Patent,  Claim 20 ), they  do \nnot change the concept of Claim 1 of the \u2018822 Patent or add inventiveness such that Claim 1 of the \u2018822 Patent cannot be representative. \nSee Fast 101 Pty Ltd. v. CitiGroup Inc. , 424 \nF.Supp.3d 385, 388 (D. Del. 2020) aff\u2019d, 834 Fed. Appx. 591, 592 (Fed. Cir. 2020) . The system \nclaims  also fail to provide any  distinctive significance from the method claims . (Compare  \n\u2018380 Patent, Claim 13 with \u2018380 Patent, Claim 20. ) They just use generic computer parts to \nexecute the claimed method \u2014they do not add, claim, or invent new technology . And the \ndependent claims only offer  specific applications of the  independent claim  limitations . For \nexample , \u201cgeolocation \u201d may be associated  with \u201csignage ,\u201d3 the \u201ccontent \u201d received may be \nan advertisement,\u201d4 and the \u201canalytics associated with the content\u201d  include things like the \n\u201cnumber of views ,\u201d \u201cnumber of actions performed ,\u201d and  \u201ca number of saves .\u201d5 None  of \nthese  change s the concept  articulated in Claim 1 of the \u2018822 Patent. \n \n3 Claim 2 of the \u2018822 Patent \n4 Claim 3 of the \u2018822 Patent \n5 Claim 8 of the \u2018822 Patent  6 \n \n The specification and issuance of terminal disclaimers adds force to the idea that \nthe \u2019822, \u2019621, and \u2019380 Patents are substantially similar and linked to the same idea. T he \nsubstantive components of the disclosures of the \u2019822,  \u2019621, and \u2019380 Patents are identical. \n\u201cA common specification is some additional indication of representativeness, because \nclaims must be supported by a written description of the invention in the specification.  \nPPS Data, LLC v. Jack Henry & Assocs.,  Inc., 404 F. Supp. 3d 1021, 1035 (E.D. Tex. 2019)\u201d). \nAlso,  the \u2018621 and \u2018380 Patents are subject to a terminal disclaimer in light of the \u2018822 \nPatent, and a \u201cterminal disclaimer is a strong clue that a patent examiner and, by concession, the applicant, thought the claims in the continuation lacked a patentable distinction over the parent\u201d.  \nSimpleAir, Inc. v. Google LLC , 884 F.3d 1160, 1168 (Fed. Cir. \n2018)  \nThe outcome is different for the  \u2019620 and \u2019108 Patents . These patents  are not \nsubstantively similar to Claim 1 of the \u2018822. For example, t he \u2019620 and \u2019108 Patents teach \nfurther techniques to influence the end -user\u2019s course of travel . This is reflected in the \ncontinued tracking of the devices \u2019 location s and ability  to update the delivered content \nwhen subsequent rules are met.  Furthermore, the specifications of the \u2019620 and \u2019108 \nPatents add flow charts and accompanying descriptions of m ethods \u201cfor providing \nstandalone application, API, or SDK\u201d in the form of new Figures 22 \u201326 that differentiate \nthe specification s from t hose of  the \u2019822, \u2019621, and \u2019380 Patents . Also, neither patent is \nsubject to a terminal disclaimer  in light of the \u2018822 Patent; t he \u2018620 Patent is only a 7 \n \n continuation in part of the \u2018822 Patent.  In whole, this differentiates  the \u2019620 and \u2019108 \nPatents  such that I cannot at this early stage of the proceedings determine that Claim 1 \nof the \u2018822 Patent is representative of these other patents\u2019 claims.  \nB. Invalidity  \nOnce a patent issues, the law presumes its validity , and anyone attacking that \nvalidity carries the burden of proof to show invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. \nSee 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282; FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Sys., Inc. , 839 F.3d 1089, 1097 (Fed. Cir. \n2016). Patent validity  under Section 101 is a question of law suitable for resolution on a \nmotion to dismi ss. See, e.g. , Berkheimer v. HP Inc. , 881 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  \nAn invention is patent -eligible if it claims a \u201cnew and useful process, machine, \nmanufacture, or composition of matter.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Supreme Court, however, \nhas long inte rpreted Section  101 to contain an implicit exception: \u201claws of nature, natural \nphenomena, and abstract ideas\u201d are not patentable.  Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , \n573 U.S. 208, 216 (2014) (quotations omitted). Courts use the two -step Alice  framework \nto determine whether a patent is invalid under Section  101. The Alice  framework first \nrequires  a court  determine whether the claims at issue are \u201c directed to \u201d a patent ineligible \nconcept , such as abstract ideas.  Id. at 217 (citing Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus \nLabs., Inc. , 566 U.S. 66 (2012)). If they are  directed to an ineligible concept , the court \nconsiders the elements of each claim, \u201cboth individually and as an ordered combination,\u201d to determine whether the additional elements amount to \u201csignificantly\u201d more than just 8 \n \n the abstract idea.  Id. at 217-18 (same). See also Yu v. Apple Inc. , 1 F.4th 1040, 1043 (Fed. \nCir. 2021).  Because the Parties did not provide any specific argument on the \u2019620 and \u2019108 \nPatents , I will only address the invalidity of Claim 1 of the \u2018822 Patent and the claims of \nwhich it is representative .   \n1. Abstract i dea \nTo determine abstractness under Alice \u2019s first step, courts ask \u201cwhat the patent \nasserts to be the focus of the claimed advance over the prior art.\u201d TecSec, Inc. v. Adobe \nInc., 978 F.3d 1278, 1292 (Fed Cir. 2020) (citations omitted). C ourts \u201cmust focus on t he \nlanguage of the [a]sserted [c]laims themselves  ... considered in the light of the \nspecification.\u201d Id. (same). The Federal Circuit has cautioned not to overgeneralize claims \nby analyzing them at \u201ca high level of abstraction\u201d that is \u201cuntethered from the language \nof the claims,\u201d lest \u201cthe exceptions to \u00a7 101 swallow the rule.\u201d Id. at 1293  (same). However, \n\u201cmere recitation of concrete, tangible components is insufficient to confer patent eligibility to an otherwise abstract idea.\u201d \nWhitServe LLC v. Donuts In c., 390 F. Supp. 3d \n571, 578 (D. Del. 2019), aff\u2019d, 809 F. App\u2019x 929 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ; see also  Alice , 573 U.S. at \n223 (\u201cThe mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\u201d).  \nClaim 1 of the \u2018822 Patent is directed to  the idea of  targeted marketing. \nSee \u2018822 \nPatent 1: 7-10 (\u201c[T]he present disclosure relates to an online platform for managing \ngeolocation and time based advertising and methods for managing and/or delivering 9 \n \n locatio n and time based advertisements .\u201d). The recited steps of associating content with \na geolocation, receiving two location  indications  from  a mobile computing device , \ncomparing the locations to determine the course of travel, and transmitting content when \nconditions are met  is nothing more than \u201c the gathering of information about one's \nintended market and attempting to customize the information then provided.\u201d See Bridg e \n& Post, Inc. v. Verizon Commc\u2019ns, Inc. , 319 F.Supp.3d 818, 824-25 ( E.D. Va . 2018) (defining \ntargeted marketing),  aff\u2019d 778 F. App\u2019x 882 (Fed. Cir. 2019) . It is a modern implementation  \nof the targeted marketing that newspapers, billboards, and radio stations have done for \ndecades . See Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One , 792 F.3d 1363, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. \n2015).  The remaining limitations  providing  an interface and administrative controls  recite \ngeneric computer devices  or functions  to enable the targeted marketing, but they do not \nchange that the claim is directed to targeted marketing. \nThe Federal Circuit has held that targeted marketing is  an abstract idea. See Bridge \n& Post, Inc. v. Verizon Commc\u2019ns, Inc. , 778 F. App\u2019x 882, 887 (Fed. Cir. 2019); Intellectual \nVentures I , 792 F.3d at 1369-70. Though not precedential, I find Bridge & Post  persuasive  \ngiven the factual parallels to this case . In that case , the Federal Circuit held that a claimed \nmethod of tagging a user\u2019s network activity with user information was directed to the abstract idea of using persistent identifiers to implement targeted marketing. \nSee 778 F. \nApp\u2019x at 886-87. BoardActive tries to distinguish this case from Bridge & Post , but without \nsuccess . First, BoardActive argues  that the claim ed method  in Bridge & Post  was broader 10 \n \n than Claim 1.  But that doesn\u2019t matter because the  Federal Circuit did not cite the b readth \nof the claim as a reason for invalidating it . See id. at 887-88.  Second, although BoardActive \ndescribes its invention as \u201cvastly different\u201d from delivering content based on network \nactivity information  (D.I. 16 at 12), I don\u2019t see that difference. B oth practice targeted \nmarketing; different inputs just determine the targeting. Third , there\u2019s nothing novel \nabout using the course of travel (as compared to the persistent identifiers in Bridge & \nPost). In fact, it\u2019s been happening for decades. Wall Drug does it along the highway in \nSouth Dakota, and destination advertisements have long been in airplane travel \nmagazines , just to name two non-digital examples. And I am not  convinced that \nadvertisement based on \u201c course of travel \u201d is distinguishable from advertisement based \non \u201clocatio n.\u201d As BoardActive states , \u201cthe delivered content corresponds to the user\u2019s \npredicted location .\u201d (D.I. 16 at 11 .) (emp hasis added)  \nBoardActive asserts that its  patents are not abstract because they are directed to \n\u201cnew and improved tracking and content-delivery systems and methods. \u201d (Id. at 9.)  But \nClaim 1 uses generic computer functionality to implement the idea of targeted marketing . \nIt does not improve computer technology itself like the patent in  Data Engine Techs. LLC \nv. Google LLC , to which BoardActive compares itself.  See 906 F.3d 999, 1007-08 (Fed. Cir. \n2018) . Claim 1 does not provide  any tangible  technological invention . The c laims, figures , \nand descriptions  recite only generic beacons, mobile computing devices, and interfaces . \nThe Federal Circuit has held other patents that just recite generic computer components 11 \n \n like a \u201ctelephone unit\u201d or a \u201cserver\u201d invalid because those components do not add an \ninventive concept to an otherwise abstract idea. See In re TLI Communications LLC P atent \nLitigation , 823 F.3d 607, 614 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ; see also  Wireless Discovery LLC v. eHarmony, \nInc., C.A. No. 22-480- GBW, 2023 WL 1778656, at * 3 (D. Del. Mar. 16, 2023) . Nor does \nBoardActive offer  a new arrangement  of these generic devices  to improve upon existing \ntechnology.  Equipping signage with a beacon radio transmitter configured to interact with \noncoming traffic  is not new . Traffic meters and electronic bridge tolls have been doing it \nfor a long time.  \n2. Invent ive concept  \nAfter  identifying a claim a s directed to an abstract idea, a court  \u201cmust examine the \nelements of the claim to determine whether it contains an inventive concept sufficient to transform the claimed abstract idea [ sic] into a patent-eligible application.\u201d \nGenetic \nTechnologies Ltd. v. Merial LLC , 818 F.3d 1369, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  Whether a claim \nsupplies an inventive concept that renders a claim significantly more than an abstract idea to which it is directed is a q uestion of law, although \u201csubsidiary fact questions\u201d  might \ninform it . \nAatrix Software , 882 F.3d at 1128.  \nThe proper prior art comparison to determine the inventiveness of BoardActive\u2019s \npatents is other forms of digital advertising, not billboards. BoardActive uses standard \ndigital advertising techniques  and applies them to  the context of billboard  \nadvertisements , but the billboards just serve as a proxy for any other location sensor in a 12 \n \n digital advertising environment . While it is possible that some consumers will see the \nadvertisement on the billboard before receiving the content that BoardActive would \ndeliver, a substantial number of people will not. For example , if you were sleeping in the \ncar as you r significant other drove by BoardActive\u2019s beacon ed billboards , you would not \nsee the billboard  advertisements,  but your device would  meet the deliv ery criteria for \ntransmission of content . When you woke up and looked at your device, you would receiv e \nthe content. For your purposes, the content would be digital advertising untethered  from  \na billboard . The same would be true for a driver whose eyes were on the road (where they \nshould be) rather than on the nearby billboards. And the same also applies for a passenger whose eyes are on her phone (or maybe even a book), rather than billboards . \nBoardActive\u2019s  arguments that Claim 1 of the \u2018822 Patent a dvances over the prior art by \novercoming (a) \u201cvisibility\u201d problems of existing billboards ; (b) \u201cana lytical information\u201d \nproblems that prevent interactivity and obtaining information on the \u201creach\u201d and \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of advertisements ; and (c) \u201cmemory\u201d problems stemming from  the end -\nusers\u2019 need to remember advertisement specifics  (D.I. 16 at 10) , are \u201cadvancements\u201d over \nbillboards , not digital advertising. They therefore miss the point because the focus on \nadvancements is from the wrong baseline.  Nothing that BoardActive claim s changes , let \nalone advances,  digital advertising.  \nNeither is t here a factual issue as to the Claim\u2019s inventiveness that precludes my \ndecision at this stage of litigation . BoardActive points to the assertions in its complaint 13 \n \n that \u201cat that time [prior to the patents] there was no way to interactively connect a brand \nor creative to a consumer in real -time\u201d  to create an issue of fact. (D .I. 16 at 17)  (quoting \nD.I. 1 \u00b6 8 ).) But BoardActive doesn\u2019t explain how that can be the case, given that on April \n10, 2017, digital advertising had been \u201c interactively connect [ing] a brand or creative to a \nconsumer in real -time\u201d  for a long time . Therefore, I do not credit these unsupported, \nimplausible assertions.  \nThe Patent Office\u2019s eligibility determinations also don\u2019t bind me . See Quad Envtl. \nTechnologies Corp. v. Union Sanitary Dist. , 946 F.2d 870, 876 (Fed. Cir. 1991) . I disagree \nwith the Office\u2019s determination of eligibility upon which BoardActive relies. The generic \nmemory storage and processing unit that the Office identified as \u201ctechnical element s\u201d are \nthe kind of  generic computer component s that cannot save a c laim from abstraction.  See \nIn re TLI Communications LLC Patent Litigation , 823 F.3d at  614. And the determination \nof \u201ccourse of travel \u201d is a generic computer  calculation  in response  to two geolocation \nindicators that is not inventive . See Content Extraction , 776 F.3d at 1349. \nBoardActive\u2019s other arguments that Claim 1 claims are inventive fall aside based \non my conclusion that the Claim is directed to an abstract idea. The claim does not advance any new technology. And targeted marketing based on course of travel and/or location has been practiced for decades. There is no  \u201cinventive concept sufficient to \ntransform the claimed abstract idea [sic] into a patent-eligible application .\u201d \nSee Genetic \nTechnologies Ltd. , 818 F.3d at 1376. 14 \n \n C. Leave To Amend  \nIt\u2019s not clear to me that BoardActive could plausibly amend facts that would \novercome this decision. But I can\u2019t say that for sure, and the Federal Circuit has noted that \namendments can add factual detail that might save a seemingly unpatentable claim. See \nAatrix Software , 882 F.3d at 1126.  So, if BoardActive has more to say that might bear on \nmy patentability determination, I\u2019ll give it a chance to file an amended pleading. But it \nshouldn\u2019t do so just to keep claims alive that otherwise can\u2019t survive.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nBoardActive , Foursquare, and others remain free to dream of a day when we all \nstop short to see the billboard advertisements available to us. For now, they can all keep \ntrying to improve their technology because BoardActive\u2019s claims under the \u2018882, \u2018621, and \u2018380 Patents are not valid.
