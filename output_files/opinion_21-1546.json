Andrews", "date": "04-08-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nSHANTELL NEWMAN,\nPlaintiff,\nv. Civil Action No. 21-1546-RGA\n\nSTATE OF DELAWARE DIVISION\nOF PUBLIC HEALTH,\n\nDefendant.\n\nShantell Newman, Wilmington, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nApril 8, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nDREWS, 1 6 Gaudin\n\nPlaintiff Shantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 4). She commenced this action seeking information\nunder the Freedom of Information Act. (D.I. 2). The Court proceeds to screen the\nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umiand v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff sues Defendant Delaware Division of Public Health\nunder the Freedom of Information Act seeking information under the Clean Air Act, 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7604(b)(1)(B). (D.I. 2 at 4-5). She wants information about the air she is\nbreathing, PFA\u2019s (i.e., polyflouroalkyls) in the water, hormones in food, and warning\nlabels for sugar. She seeks compensatory damages.\n\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a\ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Baill v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir.\n2013). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must accept\nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to\na pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, her\n\npleading is liberally construed and her Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be\n1\n\nheld to less stringent standards than formai pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d /d.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\nasserted. See id. at 11.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\n\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\n2\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. /qba/, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\nDISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff seeks information from Defendant, a state agency, under the Freedom of\nInformation Act. She does not seek information from a federal agency. As pled, it does\nnot appear that Plaintiff has actually sought any information from Defendant and,\ninstead, wants the Court to obtain it for her. To the extent Plaintiff alleges a FOIA\nviolation under Delaware Law, see 29 Del. C. \u00a7 10005, she must seek an administrative\nreview before filing suit in court. See Korn v. Wagner, 2011 WL 4357244, at *2 (Del.\nCh. Sept. 7, 2011) (citing 29 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 100005(b) & (e)). A person denied access to\npublic records must present a petition and all supporting documentation to the Chief\nDeputy Attorney General, who must then render a written determination declaring\nwhether a violation has occurred. /d. Only after Chief Deputy\u2019s determination is made,\nmay the petitioner or public body appeal the matter to the Superior Court. /d. Here,\nthere is no indication that Plaintiff exhausted her administrative remedies under\nDelaware law.\n\nThe same is true to the extent Plaintiff seeks information from an unnamed\n\nfederal agency. \u201c[T]he FOIA requires exhaustion of the administrative appeals process\n3\n\nbefore an individual may seek relief in the district court.\u201d McDonnell v. United States, 4\nF.3d 1227, 1240 (3d Cir. 1993). A plaintiff exhausts administrative remedies when she\nappeals an agency\u2019s response to her FOIA request, and the agency fails to respond to\n\nthe appeal within the appropriate time limit, denies the appeal, or makes an adverse\n\ndetermination. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)-(ii), (C). \u201cWhen a plaintiff has not exhausted\n\nadministrative remedies, the court can dismiss the complaint sua sponte for failure to\n\nstate a claim.\u201d Davis v. FBI, 2013 WL 6852351, at *3 (D. Del. Dec. 27, 2013) (citing\nIsasi v. Office of Attorney Gen., 594 F. Supp. 2d 12, 13 (D.D.C. 2009)).\n\nThe Complaint fails to state a claim for relief. Therefore, it will be dismissed.\n\nThere is no basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction over a FOIA request to a state\nagency. Amendment is therefore futile.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n"}
