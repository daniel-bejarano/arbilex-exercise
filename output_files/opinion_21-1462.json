Counsel for Respondent.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nSeptember 14, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nCLA\n\nCONNOLLY, Chief Judge:\n\nPetitioner Jack Enic Clark, who appears pro se, filed this action as a petition\nfor writ of mandamus. (D.I.1) Currently pending is Respondent Bill Fritzlen\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss, opposed by Petitioner. (D.I. 10) The matter is fully briefed.\nL BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Petition and assumed to be true for\npurposes of deciding the pending motion. See Umland vy. PLANCO Fin. Servs.,\nInc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Petitioner lives in Virginia. (D.I. 1 at 2)\nThis is action is brought against Bill Fritzlen, a Department of State officer in the\nSpecial Consular\u2019s Office in Washington, D.C. (/d.at3) The Petition asserts\njurisdiction by reason of U.S.C. Title 22-Foreign Relations and Intercourse. (/d.)\n\nPetitioner \u201cdeclares he is a citizen held hostage/imprisoned by a foreign\ngovernment\u201d by the Commonwealth of Virginia and its agents who do not have a\ncongressional mandate to do so and that the Commonwealth of Virginia is\noperating against the laws of Delaware. (Jd. at3) Petitioner asks the Court is\nissue a Writ of Mandamus or, in the alternative, to order his unconditional release.\n(Id. at 1)\n\nRespondent moves to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction. (D.I. 10)\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nRule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits the dismissal\nof an action for \u201clack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d A Rule 12(b)(1) motion may\nbe treated as either a facial or factual challenge to the court\u2019s subject matter\njurisdiction. See Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 346 (3d Cir. 2016). A\nfacial attack contests the sufficiency of the pleadings, whereas a factual attack\ncontests the sufficiency of jurisdictional facts. See Lincoln Ben. Life Co. v. AEI\nLife, LLC, 800 F.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir. 2015). When considering a facial attack, the\ncourt accepts the plaintiffs well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draws all\nreasonable inferences from those allegations in the plaintiff's favor. See In re\nHorizon Healthcare Services Inc. Data Breach Litigation, 846 F.3d 625, 633 (3d\nCir. 2017). When reviewing a factual attack, the court may weigh and consider\nevidence outside the pleadings. See Gould Elecs. Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d\n169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000).\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nThe motion to dismiss will be granted. Petitioner seeks relief in the form of\nrelease (apparently from prison) in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Petition\nis construed as a petition for writ of habeas corpus given that Petitioner seeks\n\nrelease from imprisonment in the State of Pennsylvania. Even were the Court to\nconsider this as a petition for a writ of mandamus, the allegations falls short as\nPetitioner has other forms of relief available to him.!\n\nThere is no indication that Petitioner was convicted and/or sentenced in\nDelaware. A petitioner may bring his application for a writ of habeas corpus \u201cin\nthe district court for the district wherein such person is in custody or in the district\ncourt for the district within which the State court was held which convicted and\nsentenced him and each of such district courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction to\nentertain the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d). \u201cThe plain language of the\nhabeas statute [] confirms the general rule that for core habeas petitions\n\nchallenging present physical confinement, jurisdiction lies in only one district: the\n\n' Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 \u201c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction\nof any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the\nUnited States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d\nMandamus relief is generally considered \u201ca drastic one, to be invoked only in\nextraordinary situations\u201d where government officials have clearly failed to perform\nnondiscretionary duties. Kerr v. U.S. District Court, 426 U.S. 394, 402 (1976);\nsee also Cheney v. United States Dist. Ct. for Dist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380\n(2004). To obtain mandamus relief, a plaintiff must demonstrate the lack of any\nother adequate remedy. Mallard v. U.S. District Court for So. District of Iowa, 490\nUS. 296, 309 (1989); see also Mote v. United States Dist. Ct. for Middle Dist. of\nPennsylvania, 858 F. App\u2019x 39, 40 (3d Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 906\n(2022). Additionally, writs of mandamus are only available to compel \u201ca legal\nduty which is a specific, plain ministerial act devoid of the exercise of judgment or\ndiscretion.\u201d Harmon Cove Condominium Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Marsh, 815 F.2d 949, 951\n(3d Cir. 1987).\n\n4\ndistrict of confinement.\u201d Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 443 (2004). This\nCourt does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief Petitioner seeks.\n\nIn addition, as alleged, Petitioner was convicted by the Commonwealth of\nVirginia. The Petition makes no mention that Petitioner exhausted his state court\nremedies as is required when asking a federal court to grant relief to a state\nprisoner. See O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842 (1999).\n\nFinally, Respondent cannot provide Petitioner the relief he seeks. The\nproper respondent in a habeas petition is \u201cthe person who has custody over the\npetitioner.\u201d Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. at 434. The Petition does not alleges that\nRespondent is that person. Rather, it alleges that he is an employee of the\nDepartment of State in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccordingly, Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss will be granted. It is not\nplausible that Plaintiff may be able to articulate a claim against Defendant and,\ntherefore, the Court finds amendment futile.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will grant Respondent\u2019s motion\n\nto dismiss. (D.I.10) Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nJACK ENIC; family [Clark], )\nPetitioner,\n\nVv. Civ.
