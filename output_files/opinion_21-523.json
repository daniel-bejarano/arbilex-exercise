No. 21-523-LPS \nSTAFF SGT. HUBBS, et al., \nDefendants. \nCea G. Mai, Sussex Correctional Institution , Georgetown, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nMarch 28, 2022 \nWilinington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION I. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Cea G. Mai, also known as Kelly E.S. Aliahmed (\"Mai\" or \"Plaintiff''), an inmate at \nthe Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983.1 (D.I. 1) She appears prose and has been granted lea e to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 6) \nThe Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \n1915A(a). \nII. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff alleges violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments \nof the United States Constitution, as well as violations of the _'\\DA, RLUIP A, the Terrorist Act of \n1996, and RICO. (D.l. 2 at 7) Plaintiff has filed numerous la suits seeking gender reassignment \nsurgery and a transfer to Baylor Women's Correctional Institution in New Castle, Delaware. \nThe instant Complaint asks the Court to overturn all disciplinary write-ups and further seeks \nsafe housing, release from imprisonment, and compensatory damages. (Id. at 10) Plaintiff also \nmoves for \"expedited processing and declaratory judgment.\" (D.I. 5) \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sp01 te under the screening provisions of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from \nsuch relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); ree also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915( e)(2) (in jorma \npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from governmental \n1 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a \nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See \nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n1 defendant ); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions ). The \nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to a prose plaintiff. See Phillips v. Counry of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds prose, her pleading is liberally \nconstrued and the Complaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards \nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley v. \nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366,374 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319,331 (1989)); see also \nGrqyson v. Mqyview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputabl y meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or \ndelusional \" factual scenario.\"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d \n523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissin g a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule \n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscherv. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However , before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted \npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a \nplaintiff leave to amend, unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grqyson, 293 F.3d at \n114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bel/At/. Corp. v. Twomb!J, 550 \n2 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations\" are not required, a complaint must do \nmore than simply provide \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.\" Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catafysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, \n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombfy, 550 U.S. at 570). \nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a c has substantive plausibility. See \nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may ot be dismissed for imperfect \nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombfy an Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency \nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a \nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume \ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give \u00b7 e to an entitlement to relief. See \nConnelfy v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task \nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nThe Complaint is deficientl y pled for several reasons. For example, while Plaintiff provides \na list of dates of occurrences, the body of the Complaint does not indicate when any alleged \nwrongful acts were committed by a particular defendant, making a response difficult or possibly \nimpossible . Plaintiff complains that she received false disciplinary reports, yet she also indicates that \n3 she received disciplinary hearings. The filing of false disciplinary charges does not constitute a claim \nunder \u00a7 1983 so long as the inmate was granted a hearing and an opportunity to rebut the charges. \nSee Crosby v. Piazza, 465 F. App'x 168, 172 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 653-\n54 (3d Cir. 2002)). Plaintiff appears to make claims related to PREA, including that her PREA \ncomplaints were not investigated. PREA does not provide a private right of action and, therefore, \nPlaintiff may not assert a civil PREA claim. See Williams v. Wetzel, 827 F. App'x 158, 162 (3d Cir. \n2020). Plaintiff claims she was verbally assaulted. Verbal abuse or harassment is not actionable \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Matthews v. Norristown State Hosp., 528 F. App'x 115, 119 (3d Cir. 2013); \nAleem-Xv. Westcott, 347 F. App'x 731 (3d Cir. 2009). In addition, she names several defendants \nwho are located at Baylor Correctional Institution, yet there are no allegations directed towards \nthose defendants. Finally, Plaintiff claims violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nRLUIP A, RICO, and the Terrorist Act of 1996 without any supporting facts. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n678 (stating that complaint will not suffice if it \"offers [merely] 'labels and conclusions\"' or '\"naked \nassertion[s]' devoid of 'further factual enhancement\"') (quoting Twomb!J, 550 U.S. at 555, 557). \nIndeed, merely reciting an element of a cause of action or making a bare conclusory statement is \ninsufficient to state a claim. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 at 1949. \nBecause the claims in the Complaint do not meet the pleading requirements of Iqbal and \nTwomb!J, the Complaint will be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) and \n1915A(b)(1). Since it is possible that Plaintiff may be able to cure the pleading defects, she will be \ngiven leave to file an amended complaint. \nPlaintiffs motion to expedite processing and for a declaratory judgment will be denied. (D.I. \n5) \n4 V. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny them ti.on for expedited proceeding and \ndeclarato ry judgment (D.I. 5); and (2) dismiss the Complaint as frivolous and for failure to state \nclaims upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) and \n1915A(b)(1). Plaintiff will be given leave to file an amended complaint . \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nDR. CEA G.
