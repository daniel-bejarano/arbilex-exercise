Civil Action No. 21-1463-GBW \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff Southern Africa Enterprise Development Fund (\"SAEDF\" or \"Plaintiff') filed this \naction against Defendant Ironshore Specialty Insurance Company (\"Ironshore \" or Defendant \") on \nOctober 18, 2021. D.I. 1. SAEDF filed the complaint for (1) declaratory judgment , (2) breach of \ncontract, and (3) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing against Ironshore. Id. Pending \nbefore the Court is Ironshore 's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) (the \"Motion\"). D.I. 8. The Court considered the parties' briefing (D.I. 12, 17, 181) and \nfinds a hearing on the Motion is unnecessary. For the reasons below, the Court DENIES \nIronshore's Motion. \n1 Ironshore filed corrected versions of its earlier-filed Opening Brief (D.I. 9) and Reply Brief (D.I. \n16) on February 15, 2022. See D.I. 19. \n1 I. BACKGROUND2 \nSAEDF was established in 1993 to \"encourage the creation and expansion of indigenous \nemerging enterprises, including small and medium-sized firms, in the southern Africa region[.]\" \nD.I. 1 ,r 16. This would be achieved \nthrough transactions which will assist in the initiation and expansion of a wide array \nof private enterprises, promote and disseminate modem business know-how and \npractices and demonstrate to other potential investors that private sector investment \ncan be undertaken profitably in southern Africa. The Fund will seek to develop an \ninvestment portfolio which over the long term will make the Fund self-sustaining. \nId. In 2009, SAEDF hired Inflection Capital Partners, LLC (\"ICP\") to help SAEDF privatize itself \nand establish a new private equity fund. Id. ,r,r 18-19. In November 2011, the relationship between \nSAEDF and ICP terminated. Id. ,r 20. During arbitration proceedings related to this termination , \nSAEDF learned that certain compensations paid by ICP could be \"Excess Benefits\" as defined in \nthe Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\"). Id. ,r,r 21-22. SAEDF reported ICP to the Internal Revenue \nService (\"IRS\") and United States Agency for International Development (\"USAID \"), which \ntriggered an audit of SAEDF by the Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\"). Id. ,r 23. USAID \ndetermined that SAEDF was liable for $2,337,402, because it \"violated both its general fiduciary \nrequirements and its internal controls policies by not providing discernible oversight ofICP\" (the \n\"USAID claim\"). Id. ,r,r 1, 24-29. \nIronshore issued a \"Not-for-Profit Entity and Directors , Officers Liability Insurance Policy \nIncluding Employment Practices Claims Coverage With Costs of Defense Included in the Limit \nof Liability\" insurance policy (\"the Policy\") to SAEDF. Id. ,r 30. SAEDF filed a claim with \nIronshore regarding the USAID claim. Id. ,r,r 36-44. On October 22, 2018, Ironshore denied \n2 Under Rule 12(b )( 6), the Court must accept as true all factual allegations in the Complaint and \nview those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Fed. Trade Comm 'n v. Abb Vie \nInc, 976 F.3d 327, 351 (3d Cir. 2020). \n2 SAEDF's claim. Id ,r 45. This action arises from Ironshore's denial of SAEDF's claim. See \ngenerally id \nII. LEGALSTANDARD \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). \nSuch a claim must plausibly suggest \"facts sufficient to 'draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"' Doe v. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th 335, 342 (3d \nCir. 2022) (quotingAshcroftv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,678 (2009)) (citing Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544,557 (2007)). \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\"' Klotz v. Celentano Stadtmauer & Walentowicz LLP, 991 F.3d 458,462 (3d Cir. 2021) \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). But the Court will '\"disregard legal conclusions and recitals of \nthe elements of a cause of action supported by mere conclusory statements.\"' Princeton Univ., 30 \nF.4th at 342 (quoting Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. 2016)). \n'\"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' Pinnavaia v. Celotex Asbestos Settlement Tr., \n271 F. Supp. 3d 705, 708 (D. Del. 2017) (quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 \nF.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997)), aff'd, 2018 WL 11446482 (3d Cir. Apr. 6, 2018). Rule 12(b)(6) \nrequires the court to accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the \nlight most favorable to plaintiff. Abb Vie Inc, 976 F.3d at 351. The court may consider matters of \npublic record and documents attached to, \"integral to[,] or explicitly relied upon in\" the complaint. \nSchmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014) (cleaned up); see also Spizzirri v. Zyla Life \nScis., 802 F. App'x 738, 739 (3d Cir. 2020) (same). \"A motion to dismiss 'may be granted only \n3 if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light \nmost favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\"' McCrone v. Acme Markets, 561 F. \nApp'x 169, 172 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Burlington Coat Factory, 114 F.3d at 1420). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court finds SAEDF has alleged sufficient facts to \nsupport its claim that the US AID claim falls within the plain language of the Policy. \nThe parties dispute whether the Policy is governed by the District of Columbia or Delaware \nlaw. See D.I. 1 ,r 47; D.I. 17 at 11 n.7; D.I. 12 at 7 n.4. Here, the Policy does not contain a choice\u00ad\nof-law provision. See D.I. 1-1, Ex. A. SAEDF argues that Delaware law should apply. D.I. 1 ,r \n47; D.I. 12 at 7 n.4. Ironshore argues District of Columbia law applies. D.I. 17 at 11 n.7. \nThe Court finds Delaware law applies. The parties appear to agree that the laws of District \nof Columbia or Delaware would produce the same result on the issues presented in the Motion. \nSee D.I. 12 at 7 n.4 (citing Certain Underwriter s at Lloyds, London v. Chemtura Corp., 160 A.3d \n457,464 (Del. 2017)); D.I. 18 (failing to oppose SAEDF's statement) ; see also Berg Chilling Sys., \nInc. v. Hull Corp., 435 F.3d 455, 462 (3d Cir. 2006) (\"According to conflicts of laws principles , \nwhere the laws of the two jurisdictions would produce the same result on the particular issue \npresented, there is a 'false conflict,' and the Court should avoid the choice-of-law question. \"); \nDeuley v. DynCorp Int'!, Inc., 8 A.3d 1156, 1161 (Del. 2010).3 \n3 Even if there was a conflict of laws issue between the two jurisdictions , Delaware law would \napply. The Policy is titled, \"Not-for-Profit Entity and Directors, Officers Liability Insurance \nPolicy Including Employment Practices Claims Coverage With Costs of Defense Included in the \nLimit of Liability. \" In other words, the Policy is a D&O policy. SAEDF \"is a not for profit \ncorporation organized under the laws of Delaware .\" D.I. 1 ,r 8. \"[T]he state of incorporation is \nthe center of gravity of the typical D&O policy.\" RSUI Indem. Co. v. Murdock, 248 A.3d 887, \n901-02 (Del. 2021 ). \"Delaware law governs the duties of the directors and officers of Delaware \ncorporations to the corporations, its stockholders , and its investors. As such, corporations must \nassess their need for D&O coverage with reference to Delaware law.\" Id. \n4 The parties dispute whether the Policy's definition of \"Loss\" includes the USAID claim. \nIronshore argues that the USAID claim does not fall within the indemnity coverage of the Policy. \nD.I. 17 at 2, 9-18. SAEDF argues Ironshore improperl y \"narrow[s]\" the definition of\"Loss. \" D.I. \n12 at 8. Under Delaware law, \"[t]he interpretation of an insurance policy is a question oflaw\" that \nbegins with the plain langua~e of the Policy. RSUI, 248 A.3d at 905 (quotation omitted). \"If the \ncontract language is 'clear and unambiguous , the parties' intent is ascertained by giving the \nlanguage its ordinary and usual meaning.\"' Id. \"Where the language is ambiguous, the contract is \nto 'be construed most strongly against the insurance company that drafted it.\"' Id. ( citation \nomitted), \nThe Policy defines \"Loss\" to mean: \ncompensatory damages (including back pay and front pay), punitive or exemplary \ndamages, the multiple portion of any multiplied damage award, judgments , \nsettlements , pre-and post-judgment interest, and Costs of Defense. \nD.I. 1-1, Ex. A at 6 (emphasis in original). Ironshore argues that SAEDF's claim does not meet \nany of the required elements of \"Loss.\" D.I. 17 at 11-14. Specifically , Ironshore argues that any \namounts claimed by SAEDF from the USAID claim are not for \"compensatory damages.\" D.I. 17 \nat 13. Ironshore argues that \"compensatory damages\" means \"money awarded to a victim to make \nup for an injury, damage, etc.\" (D.I. 17 at 11 (citation omitted)) and, here, \"USAID's disallowance \nof SAEDF's impermissible expenditures \" is not \"compensation \" to USAID nor has USAID \nsuffered from an \"injury.\" D.I. 17 at 13. Ironshore also argues that USAID's final administrative \norder is not a \"judgment.\" D.I. 17 at 14-18.4 \n4 The Policy does not define \"compensatory damages\" or \"judgment. \" See generally D.I. 1-1, Ex. \nA. \n5 The Court finds, at this stage of the litigation, Ironshore's interpretation of \"Loss\" is too \nnarrow and fails to interpret the term within the context of the entire Policy. See RSUI, 248 A.2d \nat 905. The Policy states: \nThe Insurer shall pay on behalf of the Not-For-Profit Entity all Loss which the \nNot-For-Profit Entity shall be legally obligated to pay as a result of a Claim \n(including an Employment Practices Claim) first made against the Not-For \nProfit Entity during the Policy Period or the Discovery Period for a Wrongful \nAct, and reported to the Insurer pursuant to Section VII. \nD.I. 1-1, Ex. A at 4 (emphasis in original). The Policy defines \"Claim\" to mean, among other \nthings, \"a civil, criminal, governmental , regulatory , administrative, or arbitration proceeding made \nagainst any Insured seeking monetary or non-monetary relief .... \" Id. at 5. The Policy defines \n\"Wrongful Act\" to mean, among other things, \"any actual or alleged act, omission, error, \nmisstatement , misleading statement , neglect or breach of duty, or Employment Practices \nWrongful Act, by the Not-For-Profit Entity.\" Id. at 8. The parties do not dispute that there is a \n\"Claim\" or that there is a \"Wrongful Act.\" See generally D.I. 17, 18; see also D.I. 12 at 8. \nThe Policy states that Ironshore must pay all \"Loss\" that SAEDF is \"legally obligated to \npay as a result ofa Claim ... for a Wrongful Act[.]\" D.I. 1-1, Ex. A at 4 (emphasis in original). \nThe Court agrees with SAEDF that a plausible reading of \"Loss\" could include the USAID claim. \nIf Ironshore must pay \"Loss\" as a result of a Claim, which includes governmental, regulatory , or \nadministrative proceeding, \"then the corresponding definition of 'compensatory damages' must \nalso include the amounts awarded by such government agency.\" D.I. 12 at 11-12.5 \nFor similar reasons, Ironshore 's argument that USAID's final administrative order is not a \n\"judgment\" improperly narrows the definition of \"Loss.\" As stated above, \"Claim\" includes \n5 USAID is an administrative agency of the United States, and the USAID claim was a result of \nan administrative audit before USAID. D.I. 1 1 1. \n6 governmental, regulatory , and administrative proceedings. USAID is an administrative agency \nthat issued a final decision ordering SAEDF to pay $2,337,402 for breaching its fiduciary duties \nand duty of care. D.I. 1 ,r,r 1, 29. Thus, the Court finds that SAEDF articulates a plausible claim \nof coverage. 6 \nFinally, Ironshore argues that even if the Court were to find that a plausible reading of \n\"Loss\" includes the USAID claim, coverage would still be excluded as \"contractual liabilities .\" \nD.I. 17 at 18. The relevant provision of the Policy states: \nThe Insurer shall not be liable to make any payment for Loss in connection with \nany Claim made against any Insured ... alleging, arising out of, based upon or \nattributable to any actual or alleged contractual liability of the Not-For-Profit \nEntity or any Insured Person under any express contract or agreement. \nD.I. 1-1, Ex. A at 11. While SAEDF and USAID entered into a grant agreement that controls \ncertain aspects of their relationship , the \"Claim\" at issue here did not arise out of any \"contractual \nliability\" between SAEDF and USAID. See D.I. 1 ,r,r 15-16. In its decision, USAID stated that \nSAEDF had breached its fiduciary duties and duty of care by not providing discemable oversight \nover its managers. USAID wrote: \n6 Ironshore also argues that SAEDF could not incur an adverse \"judgement \" \"given the expiration \nof the statute oflimitations.\" D.I. 17 at 2; see also id. at 14-18. Ironshore argues: \n[W]hile USAID's final decision on the administrative appeal warned of the \npotential for collection action, \"including the possibility of referral to the \nDepartment of Justice for litigation,\" SAEDF does not allege that USAID or the \nfederal government ever actually initiated any collection action or legal \nproceedings for repayment. The statute oflimitations has now long run on any legal \nclaim USAID might otherwise have had against SAEDF. \nId. at 14. Tue Policy, however, states that Ironshore shall pay all \"Loss\" which SAEDF is \nlegally obligated to pay as a result of a \"Claim\" for a \"Wrongful Act.\" D.I. 1-1, Ex. A at \n4. As discussed above, SAEDF has alleged sufficient facts sufficient to support its claim \nthat the USAID claim is covered by the Policy under the definition of \"Loss.\" Further, as \nnoted by SAEDF, \"nothing in the Policy\" \"conditions Ironshore 's obligations on a \ncollection action by USAID.\" D.I. 12 at 13. \n7 SAEDF violated both its general fiduciary requirements and its internal controls \npolicies by not providing discernable oversight of ICP. As a result, SAEDF paid \nICP $2,500,000 without ICP completing any substantive work towards \nprivatization ... There is no indication that SAEDF provided even a basic level of \noversight of the funds . . . SAEDF's actions violated its internal control \nrequirements for making payments and its general fiduciary responsibilities, which \nrequired SAEDF to exercise effective control and accountability of all funds. \nD.I. 1 129 (quoting D.I. 1-1, Ex. B at 6). Thus, USAID did not find that SAEDF breached the \ngrant agreement between USAID and SAEDF. For these reasons, SAEDF has stated a claim, at \nleast at this early stage, that the USAID claim falls within the plain language of the Policy. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court denies Ironshore 's Motion. \nTherefore, at Wilmington this \\6~ay of February , 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nIronshore's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (D.I. 8) is \nDENIED. IT IS ALSO HEREBY ORDERED that, not later than thirty (30) days from the date \nof this Memorandum Order, the parties shall meet and confer and file a joint proposed Scheduling \nOrder in this action consistent with the applicable form Scheduling Order of Judge Williams, \nwhich is posted at http://www/ded/uscourts.gov (See Chambers , Judge Williams, Forms), along \nwith a cover letter requesting the Court to enter the joint proposed Scheduling Order (if there are \nno disputes or other issues concerning scheduling that the Court needs to address) or to schedule \nthe Scheduling Conference . If there are disputes or other issues the Court needs to address in the \njoint proposed Scheduling Order, in the cover letter, the parties shall direct the Court to the \nparagraph numbers in the joint proposed Scheduling Ordi;w:: . \n8 GREGORYB .
