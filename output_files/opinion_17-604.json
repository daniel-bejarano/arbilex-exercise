Stein and Franklin \nKrbechek, BROWN RUDNICK LLP, Irvine, California \nCounsel for Defendants \nJanuary 13, 2023 \nWilmington, Delaware OPINION CHIEF mDGE \nI held a four-day bench trial on correction of inventorship and breach of \ncontract claims brought by Plaintiffs DODA USA, Inc. (DODA USA), DODA \nCOSTRUZIONE MACCHINE AGRICOLE, di Doda Aldo e C. snc (DODA Italy) \n(and collectively with DODA USA, DODA), and Marco Doda against Defendants \nWaste Management, Inc., WM Intellectual Property Holdings , LLC, Waste \nManagement National Services, Inc. ( collectively, Waste Management) , and James \nL. Denson, Jr. Plaintiffs alleged at trial that (1) the inventorship of U.S. Patent \nNos. 8,926,841 (the #841 patent) and 10,486,995 (the #995 patent) must be \ncorrected to list Marco Doda as a joint inventor; and (2) Defendants breached the \nparties' 2010 Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement' (NDA). D.I. 205 at 3, 26. \n1 Plaintiffs also alleged in the operative Second Amended Complaint breach of the \nparties' 2012 NDA, but they did not expressly address this claim in their posttrial \nbriefing. D.I. 66 ,r,r 125-26; D.I. 205. At trial, the parties' attorneys agreed that \nthe 2012 NDA \"bring[s] forward the 2010 [NDA]\" but is not materially different \nfrom it and applies retroactively to breaches that occurred before it was entered, \nand that I should apply the language of the 2010 NDA in determining if either \ncontract has been breached . Tr. 729:24-730:9, 731 :21-22, 732:3-13. Based on \nthese representations at trial and Plaintiffs' failure to expressly address breach of \nthe 2012 NDA in their posttrial briefing, Plaintiffs have forfeited and waived any \nseparate claim with respect to the 2012 NDA. \n2 Plaintiffs have offered numerous and varied theories of liability throughout \nthe course of this litigation. They present in their posttrial briefing, however, only \ntwo liability theories. First, they argue that Marco Doda should be added as co\u00ad\ninventor on the #841 and #995 patents because he \"collaborated with Denson on \nthe design of organic waste processing systems between 2009 and 2016 [by] \nproviding [Denson and Waste Management] disclosures in December 2009 and \nFebruary 2010 that Denson incorporated into\" the claims of the two patents. D.I. \n205 at 1. (As discussed, below, Plaintiffs refer to the December 2009 disclosures \nas the \"First Disclosed Combination\" and the February 2010 disclosures as the \n\"Second Disclosed Combination.\") Second, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants \nbreached the 2010 NDA by using in Figure 6 ofDenson's application for the #841 \nand #995 patents a drawing DODA had provided Waste Management in May \n2011. D.I. 205 at 27. The drawing was introduced at trial as part of JTX-14.2 To \n2 Plaintiffs framed their breach of contract argument in their posttrial briefing as \nfollows: \n[Waste Management] breached the 2010 NDA \nwhen Denson put DODA's non-public information into \nhis patent application and allowed it to publish. To \nprevail on a breach of contract claim, the plaintiff \"must \nshow the existence of a contract, the breach of a \ncontractual obligation, and damages as a result.\" Agilent \n3 be clear: Plaintiffs have forfeited and waived any and all theories of liability except \nthese two theories set forth in their posttrial briefing. \nTechs., Inc. v. Kirkland, C.A. No. 3512-VCS, 2010 WL \n610725, at * 14 (Del. Ch. Feb. 18, 2010). \nDODA established each element. The parties \nsigned the 2010 NDA in December 2010, preventing the \nunauthorized disclosure of information marked as \n\"'Confidential,' 'Proprietary,' or [with] some similar \ndesignation.\" (,I45.) After signing the NDA, DODA \nprovided WM with a May 2011 drawing that depicted a \n\"NEW BIOSEPARATOR\". (,I46.) The cover email \ncontained a confidentiality notice in Italian, and the \ndrawing bore DODA's trademark and a legend \ncontaining a warning in Italian against unauthorized \ndistribution or use. (Id.) \nDenson used DODA's drawing to prepare Figure 6 \nin his patent application, described how the new \nsecondary separator would work, and obtained claims \nrelating to that system. (,I49.) The disclosed information \nwas not public. (,I46.) \nD.I. 205 at 26-27. The \"f' citations in Plaintiffs' brief are to Plaintiffs' Proposed \nFindings of Fact (D.I. 206). The only drawing identified in paragraph 46 of \nPlaintiffs' proposed findings is a May 2011 drawing contained in JTX-14. D.I. 206 \n,I 46; see also Tr. 32:24-25 (Plaintiffs' counsel asserting in his opening statement \nthat the May 2011 drawing contained in JTX-14 is \"the drawing Mr. Denson lists \nand puts into Figure 6 in the patent.\"). \n4 As required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(l), I have set forth \nseparately below my findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nI.

The Inventions at Issue \n15) The #841 patent issued on January 6, 2015, and the #995 patent issued \non November 26, 2019. JTX-1; JTX-3. The patents share a common written \ndescription and identify Denson as the sole inventor. JTX-1; JTX-3. \n16) The #841 and #995 patent claims at issue cover a system for \nconverting organic waste into a slurry that can be used in anaerobic digesters to \nproduce biogas, transportation fuels, and other useful products. #841 patent at 1. \nThe system is designed to create a uniform fuel slurry by using multiple tanks to \nblend organic waste of various physical and chemical properties, including \ndiffering levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD). #841 patent at 6:13-22. \n17) The invention solves the problem of anaerobic digesters breaking \ndown while producing methane from highly variable waste streams due to \nvariations in the chemical and physical properties of the waste materials. The \n9 invention achieves this goal by mixing and blending various waste streams into a \nuniform fuel product with consistent levels of solids and COD that does not upset \ndigesters. #841 patent at 6:26-34. \n18) The #841 patent has 40 claims. The #995 patent has 27 claims. \n19) Claim 16 of the #841 patent reads: \nAn organic waste processing system to produce to \nproduce a slurry for the production of bio-gas, \ntransportation fuels or chemical products, and a residual \nsolid, comprising: \n[a] a hopper configured to receive sorted organic waste \nhaving contaminants from one or more sources; \n[b] a separator system in communication with the hopper \nand configured to receive the sorted organic waste from \nthe hopper and to remove at least a portion of the \ncontaminants in the sorted organic waste, wherein the \nseparator system comprises a primary separator; \n[c] a wash water liquid tank in communication with the \nseparator system and containing wash water, wherein at \nleast a portion of the wash water from the wash water \ntank is periodically injected into the separator system \nupon request; \n[ d] a product tank in communication with the separator \nsystem and configured to receive organic waste from the \nseparator system, which has been processed by the \nseparator system; and \n[e] a make-up product tank in communication with the \nseparator system and configured to receive the sorted \norganic waste from the separator system having low \n10 COD, wherein at least a portion of the organic waste \nfrom the make-up product tank is periodically injected \ninto the product tank upon request. \n#841 patent at 16:11-37. \n20) For ease of reference, I will follow the parties' practice at trial and \ndiscuss the system covered by these claims as comprising a combination of these \nfive elements: 16(a) a hopper; 16(b) a separator system; 16(c) a wash water tank;3 \n16( d) a product tank; and 16( e) a make-up product tank. \n21) Claim 26 of the #841 patent depends from claim 21, which in tum \ndepends from claim 16. \n22) Claim 21 reads: \nThe system of claim 16, the separator system further \ncomprising a secondary separator in communication with \nthe primary separator and configured to receive the \norganic waste from the primary centrifugal \u00b7separator and \nto remove at least a portion of the contaminants in the \norganic waste. \n#841 patent at 16:59-63. \n3 Claim 16 and the #841 patent's written description use \"wash water tank\" and \n\"wash water liquid tank\" interchangeably. The parties also treated the phrases as \nsynonymous throughout the trial and in their briefing. \n11 23) Claim 26 reads: \nThe system of claim 21, the secondary separator is \nconfigured to remove contaminants greater than 8 \nmillimeters from the organic waste. \n#841 patent at 17:13-15 (sic). \n24) Plaintiffs contend, and Defendants do not dispute, that claims 16, 21, \nand 26 of the #841 patent are in all material respects the same respectively as \nclaims 1, 11, and 16 of the #995 patent. See Tr. 13:22-14:3 (Plaintiffs' counsel); \nD.I. 205 at 4. Accordingly, I will follow the parties' lead and substantively discuss \nand cite only the #841 patent. \nD. Timeline of the Parties' Relationship and Communications \n25) In January 2009, Martin Felker attended a trade show where he spoke \nwith DODA USA's then-general manager Rich Miller and watched a video about \nDODA's \"wet\" system for organic waste processing (also referred to as the \n\"kitchen\") that was installed at a biogas facility in Rivalta, Italy. Tr. 520: 11-\n521: 14 (Felker). At Felker's request, Miller sent him more information about the \n\"wet\" system and Felker circulated that information internally at Waste \nManagement. PTX-5; PTX-6; see Tr. 479:1-11 (Felker). Felker provided \ninformation about DODA' s system to Waste Management employees as part of an \nupdate on several equipment vendors that Waste Management was considering \n12 using in connection with its Orange County transfer station project. Tr. 523 :7-\n525 :5 (Felker); see DTX-109. \n26) In May 2009, Felker shared a summary and diagram ofDODA's wet \nsystem with Jim Denson, who had been researching anaerobic digestion as a \nsolution for diverting food waste. DTX-101; see Tr. 766:15-21 (Denson). \n27) In November 2009, Felker and Denson traveled to Rivalta, Italy, \nwhere they viewed DODA's wet and dry systems and discussed purchasing \nequipment from DODA that could be customized for Waste Management's needs. \nTr. 772:1-773:13 (Denson). The parties agreed during this visit that Marco Doda \nwould prepare designs for DODA equipment to be used for a new organic waste \nprocessing system at the Orange County transfer station. Tr. 117:22-118:8 (M. \nDoda). \n1. The So-Called \"First Disclosed Combination\" \n28) On December 4, 2009, in an email with the subject line \"DRAWINGS \nSENDING,\" Simona Mazzocchi-who worked at DODA Italy as an assistant to \nMarco and Ada Doda-sent Rich Miller two AutoCAD drawings dated December \n4, 2009. PTX-26; see Tr. 120:13-121:1 (M. Doda). AutoCAD is a computer\u00ad\naided design and drafting software application. The mark \"DODA\" appears in the \nupper left comer of each drawing. Neither drawing identifies the name of a person \n13 and neither drawing is marked in any way to suggest it was confidential. The first \ndrawing, titled \"sktr0 l ,\" depicts a garbage truck emptying unidentified semi-solid \ncontents into au-shaped container (i.e., a hopper) that in turn dumps its contents \nonto the ground. The second drawing, titled \"bioseparator,\" depicts a waste \nprocessing system with, among other things, a hopper, separator, dilution line, \ntransfer pump, and a \"liquid storage tank.\" PTX-26 at 4. Simona stated in her \nemail to Miller: \"[A]s per your agreement with Marco, here attached we send you \nthe agreements requested.\" PTX-26 at 2. \n29) On December 6, 2009, Miller forwarded the email and drawings to \nMartin Felker. Miller stated in the email that he was \"not sure ifDODA shared \nthese concept drawings with you or not\" and asked Felker to share the drawings \nwith Jim Denson and Tom Koutroulis. PTX-26 at 1. \n30) Felker in tum forwarded Miller's email and the drawings to Denson \nand Koutroulis. Felker stated in his email: \"Tom/Jim: preliminary concept \ndrawings from Doda attached. Spoke with Rich Miller today, he is expecting some \nupdated drawings and a proposal to us for the system by the end of the week.\" \nPTX-26 at 1. \n31) On December 11, 2009, in an email with the subject line \n\"DRAWINGS,\" Simona Mazzocchi sent Miller two AutoCAD drawings dated \n14 December 4, 2009. PTX-27. The mark \"DODA\" appears in the upper left comer \nof each drawing. Neither drawing identifies the name of a person and neither \ndrawing is marked in any way to suggest it was confidential. The first drawing, \ntitled \"sktr02,\" depicts a garbage truck on an unloading ramp emptying \nunidentified semi-solid contents into au-shaped container (i.e., a hopper) that in \ntum dumps its contents onto the ground. The second drawing, titled \"sktr0 l ,\" \ndepicts a waste processing system with, among other things, a hopper, separator, \ndilution line, transfer pump, and a \"liquid storage tank,\" connected to a tank with a \nbuilt-in waste compactor. PTX-27 at 4. Simona stated in her email to Miller: \"as \nper your agreements with Marco, here attached w[ e] send you 2 file[ s] with \nseparation plant diagrams.\" PTX-27 at 1. \n32) On December 11, 2009, Miller forwarded the email and drawings to \nFelker. Miller stated that the drawings reflect \"how a transfer station could be set \nup to process and load out organics to a tanker truck\" and that he should be able to \nprovide pricing information by the following week. PTX-27 at 1. He also asked \nFelker to share the drawings with Denson and Koutroulis. PTX-27 at 1. \n33) On December 22, 2009, Miller sent Felker an email with the subject \nline \"Organic Processing System.\" PTX-28. Miller stated in the email that he was \nattaching \"a quotation on the Organics Processing Equipment for Orange County \n15 facility.\" PTX-28 at 1 ( capitalization in the original). The attachment is a three\u00ad\npage letter signed by Miller that provided \"a quotation and brief description of \neach component of the DODA ORGANICS PROCESSING SYSTEM.\" PTX-28 \nat 2. The letter describes five components of the system: ( 1) a hopper with an \nauger 400 millimeters in diameter and an optional second auger 3 00 millimeters in \ndiameter; (2) an optional hydraulic controlled top cover; (3) a bio separator; ( 4) an \nauxiliary hydraulic package to operate the hydraulic components of the system; \nand ( 5) an optional organics transfer manifold equipped to pump and transfer \nslurry. PTX-28. Neither the letter nor the cover email are marked in any way to \nsuggest they are confidential. Miller stated in his email to Felker: \"You would \nneed the system with the Manifold to load out trucks etc. as described. We could \nbe ready in F eh. probably the middle to later part. This would be as modified per \npdf s sent earlier.\" PTX-28 at 1. \n34) I will follow DODA's lead and refer to the three December 2009 \nemail chains and their attachments collectively as \"the First Disclosed \nCombination.\" See D.I. 206 ,r 27. \n35) The parties dispute whether the \"liquid storage tank\" depicted in the \ndrawings of the First Disclosed Combination meets the wash water tank element of \nclaim 16 of the #841 patent. The patents do not define \"wash water,\" let alone \n16 \"wash water tank,\" or \"wash water liquid tank.\" The parties never asked me to \nconstrue these terms, and the parties' competing experts did not define the terms at \ntrial or explain what an artisan of ordinary skill would understand the terms to \nmean in general. \n36) DODA argues that the liquid storage tank meets the claimed wash \nwater tank element because \"it contain[s] wash water (which the patents indicate \ncan be organic waste -or slurry -that has sat for 2-3 days and has become 'liquid \nenough to be used as wash water again') and provide[s] a dilution line back to the \nseparator system to reinject the wash water.\" D.I. 211 at 2 (quoting JTX-1 at 3:34-\n35). \n3 7) I find as a matter of fact that the liquid storage tank depicted in the \ndrawings of the First Disclosed Combination meets the wash water tank element of \nclaim 16 of the #841 patent for four reasons. First, the written description of the \npatents speaks of\"reclaim[ing] wash water\" (JTX-1 at fig.I), \"[u]sing the organic \nwaste as wash water\" (JTX-1 at 3:36-37), and using \"wash water to thin the \norganic waste slurry\" (JTX-1 at 5:46-47). Thus, wash water used to dilute the \nwaste being processed can come from the process itself. Second, the drawings \nshow a dilution line that runs from the liquid storage tank back to the separator, \nwhere organic waste is \"diluted .... to a pumpable consistency.\" PTX-28 at 3. \n17 Third, Miller's letter enclosed with the third December 2009 email describes \nvalves that \"allow separated organic slurry to be transferred.from a storage tank to \nthe Organics Hopper/or diluting difficult organic batches when necessary[.]\" \nPTX-28 at 3 (emphasis added). Fourth, Waste Management's expert, Dr. Gidda, \ndid not dispute the testimony ofDODA's expert, Dr. Smith, that the liquid storage \ntank depicted in the drawings in the First Disclosed Combination constituted a \nwash water tank. \n38) The parties dispute in their briefing who came up with the idea of the \ndilution line depicted in the First Disclosed Combination. Plaintiffs argue in their \nreply brief that \"Marco Doda testified that the liquid tank dilution line was his \nidea.\" D.I. 211 at 3 (citing paragraphs 25 through 33 of Plaintiffs' Proposed \nFindings of Fact (D.I. 206)). But that is not what Marco Doda testified to in the \nportions of the trial transcript cited by Plaintiffs. Marco Doda merely testified \nabout the purpose that dilution served (Tr. 135: 17-22), that the dilution line was \n\"new\" and not part ofDODA's Rivalta system (Tr. 136:16-20), and that Marco \nDoda was not \"aware of any other system[] in the world that had a hopper, a \nseparator, and a liquid tank with a dilution line like [the dilution line depicted in \n18 PTX-26]\" (Tr. 137:4-7).4 By contrast, Felker testified that during the November \n2009 visit to Rivalta he and Denson \"made the suggestion [to Marco Doda] to \nprovide dilution water into the hopper to make the material more pumpable as it \nexited the hopper.\" Tr. 496:20-498: 10 (Felker). And Denson similarly testified \nthat during that visit he and Felker \"asked [DODA] to install a dilution line into the \nhopper.\" Tr. 773:20-21. Felker's and Denson's testimony on this point is also \nconsistent with an email sent by Rich Miller to Felker on November 17, 2009 Gust \ndays after the Rivalta trip) confirming that DODA \"will also be putting a[n] \neffluent discharge in the hopper from the Bio Separator to bring some liquid back \nin the unit as it[']s processed\" and that \"in this manner we will have the system \n4 Marco Doda' s testimony with respect to the dilution line differed notably from \nhis unambiguous testimony with respect to other waste system elements DODA \nhas claimed that Marco Doda invented. See, e.g., Tr. 140:4-14 (\"Whose idea was \nit to place the hopper at the end of the unloading ramp? A. My idea. Q. Whose \nidea was it to place the separator attached to the hopper next to it in that formation? \nA. My idea. Q. And whose idea was it to put the liquid storage tank and transfer \npump on that side of the ramp? A. My idea. Q. And whose idea was it to put a \nline running off the transfer from the truck in that location? A. My idea.\") (M. \nDoda); Tr. 162:24-25 (\"Q. And who proposed th[e] idea [of a secondary separator \nwith a smaller screen], Mr. Doda? A. Me.\") (M. Doda). \n19 plumbed and set with valves so we can transfer to holding tanks or bring the \nprocessed liquids back into the hopper.\" PTX-22 at 1. \n39) Accordingly, I find as a matter of fact that DODA did not establish by \nclear and convincing evidence that Marco Doda conceived of the idea of the \ndilution line depicted in the First Disclosed Combination. And based on that \nfinding, I find also that DODA did not establish by clear and convincing evidence \nthat Marco Doda conceived of the idea of the wash water tank element in claim 16 \nof the #841 patent or the combination of the hopper, separator, and wash water \ntank elements of claim 16 of the #841 patent. \n2. Denson's Conception of a Multi-Tank System \n40) Denson left Rivalta impressed with the quality ofDODA's equipment. \nBased on that assessment and DODA's communications with Waste Management \nin December 2009, he recommended to his colleagues at Waste Management that it \nuse DODA as an equipment supplier for the Orange County organic waste system \nproject. Tr. 776: 17-22 (Denson). \n41) On January 15, 2010, Denson emailed DODA a layout for the Orange \nCounty organic waste processing system. JTX-7. The purpose of the layout was \nto provide DODA with an understanding of the size of the building at the Orange \nCounty site \"and the general spatial relationship of the equipment that [Denson] \n20 wanted to be put in the building.\" Tr. 777:9-12 (Denson). Denson did not intend \nfor the layout to serve as an engineering drawing or a process design, and therefore \nhe did not depict in the layout the flow of materials in the waste processing system. \nTr. 777-78 (Denson). \n42) On January 28, 2010, Denson sent DODA an email that read in \nrelevant part: \nI think we are at the point where we should nail down the \nrelationships for the equipment in the building we have. \nI have attached a very simple drawing of the plan of the \nbuilding with the end Elevation. . . . Please have you[ r] \ntechnical office place the feeder, bio-separator, and tank \nmanifolds in a drawing so we can review the \nrelationships to each other. \nDTX-130 at 1. The drawing Denson attached to the email was a three-dimensional \ndepiction of a waste processing system with, among other things, four tanks \nconnected by piping. See DTX-130 at 5-6; Tr. 779:19-781:2 (Denson). \n43) On February 11, 2010, in reply to Denson's January 28, 2009 email, \nAda Doda sent three AutoCAD drawings that are dated February 11, 2010 and \ndepict the layout and configuration of the system to be installed at the Orange \nCounty plant. JTX-8 at 5, 7-8. The mark \"DODA\" appears in the legend located \nin the bottom right comer of each drawing. The legend identifies \"P .L.\" as the \n21 \"disegnatore\" (drawer5) and \"Orange Plant\" as the \"descrizione\" (description) and \ncontains a warning in Italian against unauthorized distribution or use, typewritten \nin a font so small as to be almost illegible. The drawings and cover email are not \notherwise marked in any way to suggest they are confidential. \n3. The So-Called \"Second Disclosed Combination\" \n44) On February 25, 2010, in an email with the subject line \"UPDATE,\" \nMiller informed Denson, Felker, and Koutroulis that a \"new finalized quotation\" \nwas \"pretty much complete,\" subject to any language Waste Management wished \nto add, and that DODA wanted to \"do pretty much a turnkey deal for WM.\" PTX-\n41 at 1. Miller described in the email certain components of the system that \nDODA had been developing for Waste Management. Miller wrote in relevant part: \nWe don't obviously want a train wreck here and there \nwould be another easy solution. We use the Bio \nSeparator with the mm screen to remove the plastic etc. \nThe product could go to a storage tank or pumped to \nanother Bio Separator with a screen of 8mm and a \nhigher speed electrical motor. This would produce \nsomething like a cream we feel and if there was anything \nin the way of contaminants that got past the first unit \nwould be captured here. The other option would be to \npull the product out of a storage tank when loading a \ntruck, run it through the second Bio Separator and fill the \n5 I adopt Plaintiffs' undisputed translation of \"disegnatore\" as \"drawer,\" provided \nby Mr. Doda during his direct examination. Tr. 164:23, 186:8-17 (M. Doda). \n22 tanker truck that will be hauling to the municipality. We \ncould just try a smaller screen in the first separator but \nare concerned on the through put and some of the \norganics coming out with the contaminants. \nPTX-41 (emphasis added). Miller's email is not marked in any way to suggest that \nits contents are confidential. \n45) On February 26, 2010, Felker emailed Miller back and said that \nDenson would \"circle back with [Miller] on the proposal and agreement.\" PTX-\n41. \n46) On February 26, 2010, in an email with the subject line \"ORANGE \nCOUNTY QUOTATION,\" Miller sent Denson, Felker, Koutroulis, and Pierce a \ntechnical bid and price quotation for supplying and installing a DODA waste \nprocessing system at the Orange County plant. PTX-42. The technical bid lists the \nfollowing items to be supplied by DODA USA: (1) a stainless steel organics \nhopper; (2) a bio separator to be connected to and fed by the organics hopper, with \na perforated screen for organics to pass through before falling into a storage tank; \n(3) distribution manifolds to be connected to storage tanks, allowing for the \ncontents to be transferred to transport trucks; ( 4) a hydraulic power unit; ( 5) a \ncontrol panel; ( 6) stainless steel piping, hoses, and related accessories; and (7) a \nchopper pump for plumbing waste content into waste water storage tanks. The bid \nstated that \"[w]hile [DODA had] confidence that the processed particle sizes of \n23 approximately 15mm\" would meet Waste Management's expectations, Doda \n\"ha[s] the ability to add a second Bio Separator to the system to further reduce \nparticle sizes if necessary.\" PTX-42 at 2. The technical bid and cover email are \nnot marked in any way to suggest they are confidential. \n47) I will follow DODA's lead and refer to the emails exchanged between \nthe parties on February 25 and 26, 2010 and the February 26, 2010 bid collectively \nas \"the Second Disclosed Combination.\" See D.I. 206 ,r 37. \n48) The Second Disclosed Combination discloses a hopper, separator \nsystem, and wash water liquid tank covered by elements 16(a), 16(b), and 16(c) of \nthe #841 patent; a secondary separator covered by claim 21; and a secondary \nseparator that is configured to remove contaminants greater than eight millimeters \nand that is covered by claim 26. PTX-41; PTX-42; Tr. 594: 17-598:4 (Smith). \n49) The parties dispute who first came up with the concept of a secondary \nseparator and the concept of a secondary separator with an eight-millimeter screen. \n50) Plaintiffs contend that Marco Doda originated both concepts. D.I. 205 \nat 11-12. Marco Doda testified at trial that he was the originator of the concepts of \na secondary separator and of a secondary separator with a screen smaller than 15 \nmillimeters. Tr. 162 (M. Doda). In his words: he \"passed [this] information to \n[his] assistant [and] she translate[d] [the information] and then shared [the \n24 translated information] [with] Rich Miller at [DODA] USA.\" Tr. 163:7-9 (M. \nDoda). But Marco Doda did not testify at trial that he conceived of the idea of a \nsecondary separator with an eight-millimeter screen. Rather, Doda testified that he \nhad used an eight-millimeter screen in a primary separator he installed in Canada \nbefore December 2009. Tr. 111: 15-112:6 (M. Doda). And he testified that he \n\"anticipat[ ed]\" using an eight-millimeter screen in a secondary separator he drew \nin May 2011-i.e., more than a year after the materials in the Second Disclosed \nCombination were provided to Waste Management. Tr. 174:16-175:6 (discussing \nJTX-14, which was created in May 2011) (M. Doda). \n51) Plaintiffs did not call Marco Doda' s assistant to testify at trial or offer \nher deposition testimony, and did not introduce at trial any written communications \nbetween Doda and his assistant to support his testimony. Nor did Plaintiffs \nintroduce into evidence any written or electronic communications between Marco \nDoda and Miller (or any other DODA employee) to corroborate Doda's testimony \nthat he \"passed on\" to Miller the ideas of a secondary separator and a secondary \nseparator with a smaller screen. Plaintiffs did not call Miller to testify at trial; nor \ndid they offer at trial deposition testimony from Miller or counter Defendants' \nassertion that Plaintiffs could have called Miller as a witness. In short, Plaintiffs \nfailed to introduce at trial anything other than Miller's February 25, 2010 email to \n25 corroborate Plaintiffs' claim that Marco Doda originated the concepts of a \nsecondary separator and a secondary separator with an eight-millimeter screen. \n52) There is nothing in the language of Miller's email that supports Marco \nDoda' s claim of inventorship of the secondary separator or the secondary separator \nwith an eight-miller screen. On the contrary, the structure and language of the \nemail suggest that others besides Doda contributed to the ideas of a secondary \nseparator and a secondary separator with an eight-millimeter screen. Miller \nmentions Doda only in the second paragraph of the email. He states in that \nparagraph that \"Marco would also like to include [in the system] a conveyor to \ntake the trash to a dumpster or whatever, for more versatility.\" PTX-41 at 2. In \nthe next paragraph, Miller changes subjects and says that \" [ t ]here has also been \nquite a bit of discussion regarding the digester you plan on taking the organics to.\" \nPTX-41 at 2. In the very next sentence, Miller says that he \"spoke with numerous \nbio guys and Dr. Sordelli in Italy in particular,\" and he then summarizes concerns \nthat those \"bio guys\" and, in particular, Dr. Sordelli raised with him. It is at this \npoint in the email that Miller says, \"We don't obviously want a train wreck here \nand there would be another easy solution\" and then immediately proceeds to \npropose as the \"easy solution\" the secondary separator and a secondary separator \nwith an eight-millimeter screen. Thus, if anything, the February 25, 2010 email \n26 supports the finding that Marco Doda did not by himself come up with the \nconcepts of a secondary separator and secondary separator with an eight-millimeter \nscreen. \n53) Denson testified at trial that he (i.e., Denson) originated the idea of a \nsecondary separator. See Tr. 784:1-785:20, 815:16-816:5, 820:4-14 (Denson). \n54) In light of this conflicting and ambiguous evidence, I find as a factual \nmatter that Plaintiffs did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that Marco \nDoda originated the idea of a secondary separator or a secondary separator with an \neight-millimeter screen. Having heard and considered the testimony and \ndocumentary evidence introduced at trial, I am not left with an abiding conviction \nthat it is highly probably that Marco Doda conceived of those ideas or the \ncombination of either of those ideas with a hopper, primary separator, and wash \nwater tank. \n4. Completion of the Orange County Transfer Station \n55) On April 29, 2010, Denson sent Miller an email in which he attached \n\"some AutoCAD drawings that represent our final engineering placement of the \nequipment\" and asked Miller to pass on several questions about the configuration \nof the equipment to DODA, noting that Waste Management was \"expecting to \n27 submit the engineering drawings for the building permit next week.\" PTX-46. On \nApril 30, 2010, Miller forwarded the email and drawings to Ada Doda. \n56) On May 14, 2010, in an email with the subject line \"Orange \nequipment layout,\" Ada Doda sent Miller and Denson two AutoCAD drawings \ndated May 13, 2010. PTX-46. The mark \"DODA\" appears in the legend located \nin the bottom right comer of each drawing. The legend identifies \"P .L.\" as the \n\"disegnatore\" (drawer) and \"Orange Plant\" as the \"descrizione\" (description) and \ncontains a warning in Italian against unauthorized distribution or use, typewritten \nin a font so small as to be almost illegible. The drawings and cover email are not \notherwise marked in any way to suggest they are confidential. Ada Doda stated in \nher email to Miller and Denson: \"I had some drawings from my technical office \n'boys' that You will find attached in dwg form for Mr. Denson and Pdffor You. I \nhope these are those Mr. Denson is looking for.\" PTX-46. \n57) On May 27, 2010, DODA USA and WMNS signed an Equipment \nPurchase Agreement pursuant to which DODA agreed to \"[p]rovide detailed \ndrawings and specifications for the infrastructure required to install the Equipment \nat WM' s facility\" and that \"[ u ]pon Final Payment, all right, title and ownership of \nthe Equipment shall pass to WM.\" JTX-9 \u00a7 \u00a7 I, 5. \n28 5 8) The Equipment Purchase Agreement also provided that if the parties \nconsidered the trial period for Waste Management's use ofDODA equipment at \nthe Orange County plant successful, they could negotiate an agreement for DODA \nto become Waste Management's exclusive supplier of waste processing \nequipment. JTX-9 \u00a7 15. \n59) In September 2010, DODA installed the Orange Transfer Doda \nFoodPower system at Waste Management's Orange County plant. Tr. 170:22-\n171 :6 (M. Doda); see PTX-52. \n5. Non-Disclosure Agreements and Patent Applications \n60) In November 2010, the parties began to negotiate an agreement \npursuant to which Waste Management would purchase from DODA a minimum \namount of equipment and processes and DODA would agree to supply such \nequipment exclusively to Waste Management (i.e., and not Waste Management's \ncompetitors). Tr. 288: 12-291: 11, 300 (Pope). \n61) On December 9, 2010, DODA USA and WMNS entered into the 2010 \nNDA, pursuant to which the parties agreed not to disclose to third parties \ninformation they received from each other that was marked \"'Confidential,' \n'Proprietary,' or [with] some similar designation.\" JTX-11112-3. The 2010 \nNDA further provides that \"[a]ll documents and other tangible objects containing \n29 or representing Confidential Information ... shall be and remain the property of \nthe disclosing Party .... \" JTX-11 ,I 7. It also states that publicly available \ninformation is not covered by the NDA. JTX-11 ,r 2. \nwrote: 62) On May 26, 2011, in an email sent to Denson and Wessels, Ada Doda \nHi, \nplease find attached dwg files required. I also add pdf forms. \nAny further information You may need please do not hesitate to \ncontact us \nBest regards \nAda \nJTX-14 at 1. The words \"confidential\" and or \"proprietary\" do not appear in the \nemail, and there are no other English words in the email that would have put a \nrecipient of the email on notice that the email or its attachments included \nconfidential or proprietary material. \n63) Below Ada Doda' s email signature line is a paragraph written in \nItalian. In their posttrial Proposed Findings of Fact, Plaintiffs state that this \nparagraph constitutes \"a confidentiality notice in Italian.\" D.I. 206 ,I 46. Plaintiffs \ncite in support of this assertion only JTX-14, which reads in relevant part: \nA VVISO: le informazioni contenute o allegate alla \npresente sono dirette unicamente al destinatario sopra \nindicato. In caso di ricezione da parte di persona diversa e vietato qualunque tipo di distribuzione o copia. \n30 Chiunque riceva questa comunicazione per errore e \ntenuto ad inf ormarci immediatamente per telefono ed a \nrestituirci quanta ricevuto, per pasta, all' indirizzo di cui \nsopra. Sebbene sia cura della ditta DODA proteggere i1 \nproprio sistema di posta elettronica da virus o altri fatti \ndannosi, la stessa non garantisce che questo messaggio \n(inclusi i suoi eventuali allegati) sia indenne da virus e \nnone responsabile per danni subiti dal destinatario a \nseguito del ricevimento, apertura o uso di questo \nmessagg10. \nJTX-14 at 1. There is no English translation of this paragraph anywhere in JTX-\n14. \n64) I do not speak or read Italian. \n65) When I inputted the language from the paragraph in Google Translate, \nI obtained this translation of the text: \nNOTICE: The information contained or attached hereto \nis directed solely to the above recipient indicated. In case \nof receipt by a different person, any type of distribution \nor copying is prohibited. Anyone who receives this \ncommunication by mistake is required to inform us \nimmediately by telephone and e-mail return to us what \nyou have received, by post, to the above address. \nAlthough it is DODA company's concern to protect its \nelectronic paste [sic] system from viruses or other \nharmful facts, the same does not guarantee that this \nmessage (including its possible attachments) is free from \nviruses and is not responsible for damages suffered by \nthe recipient as a result of receipt, opening or use of this \nmessage. \n31 Translate, GOOGLE, https://translate.google.com (select Italian in the \"Detect \nlanguage\" dropdown menu and then enter Italian text to be translated). \n66) Ada Doda testified on direct examination at trial in relevant part as \nfollows: \nQ. Turning back to your e-mail on the first page of the \nexhibit, JTX-14, what information are you giving at the \nbottom of your e-mail, the signature block? \nA. Please be advised that information and drawings \nattached are confidential, for the purpose of --for the -\u00ad\nfor the --\nQ. Did anyone at Waste Management ever ask you \npermission to use this drawing other than for the Orange \nCounty plant? \nA.No. \nTr. 239:1-9 (A. Doda). Waste Management never challenged or objected to this \ntestimony. Nor did it ever offer a competing translation of the paragraph below \nAda Doda' s signature block. Plaintiffs did not cite Ada Doda' s testimony in their \nProposed Findings of Fact (D.I. 206) to support their assertion that the paragraph \n\"contained a confidentiality notice in Italian\" and therefore forfeited any right to \nrely on that testimony as proof of the content of the paragraph. But in any event, I \nfind that Ada Doda's testimony about the content of the paragraph below her \nsignature line is not credible and would not rely on it. \n32 67) Ada Doda attached to her May 26, 2011 email two AutoCAD \ndrawings. The drawings are dated May 25, 2011. They depict a proposed organics \nprocessing system that included a secondary separator. JTX-14. \n68) The mark \"DODA\" appears in the legend located in the bottom right \ncomer of each drawing. The legend identifies \"P.L.\" as the \"disegnatore\" (drawer) \nand \"Orange Plant\" as the \"descrizione\" (description) and contains a warning in \nItalian against unauthorized distribution or use, typewritten in a font so small as to \nbe nearly illegible. JTX-14. \n69) Waste Management filed the application for the #841 patent on June \n27, 2011. JTX-1. Denson used the May 25, 2011 drawing (JTX-14) to help \nprepare Figure 6 in the patent application. Tr. 820: 1-3 (Denson); see also Tr. \n596:18-23 (stating that the May 25, 2011 drawing and Figure 6 of the #841 patent \nare \"essentially the same drawing\") (Smith). Denson did not seek DODA's \npermission to use the May 25, 2011 drawing because he did not think permission \nwas required. Tr. 811 :22-812:2 (Denson). \n70) DODA USA and WMNS entered into a second NDA, dated April 13, \n2012, confirming that \"[f]or the avoidance of doubt, holding tank mixing \nsequences and/or customization ofDODA equipment\" made by Waste \n33 Management or DODA at Waste Management's request \"will remain confidential \nto [Waste Management].\" JTX-15 at 4. \n71) Waste Management filed the application for the #995 patent on \nFebruary 16, 2017. JTX-3. \n6. State-of-the-Art and Inventive Contribution Findings \n72) Plaintiffs admit, and I find as a matter of fact, that the hopper, \nseparator system, and waste water tank elements of claim 16 of the #841 patent and \na separator with an eight-millimeter screen were known in the art in isolation as of \nDecember 2009. See Tr. 946:20-21 (\"All of every element of claim 16 alone was \nin the art.\") (Plaintiffs' counsel); Tr. 993:7-13 (\"the eight-millimeter screen was in \nthe state of the art in isolation\") (Plaintiffs' counsel); Tr. 111 :8-112:3, 114:24-\n115: 10 ( stating that DODA supplied a separator with an eight-millimeter screen to \na Canadian company before December 2009) (M. Doda). \n73) I also find as a matter of fact, based on Dr. Gidda's testimony and \ndocumentary evidence introduced at trial, that the concept of a secondary separator \nwas known in the art before December 2009 and that the combination of a hopper, \nwaste water tank, and separator system with a primary centrifugal separator and a \nsecondary separator with varied screen sizes was also known in the art as of \nDecember 2009. See Tr. 865:17-885:18 (Gidda); DTX-211 at 224-26 (showing \n34 Torsvik facility with a hopper (reception pit), wash water tank equivalent (mixing \nand diluting with hot water steam), primary separator (sand trap), and secondary \nseparator (flotation separator)); DTX-211 at 327,469 (showing Ypres facility with \nhopper (deep bunker unit), wash water tank equivalent (recirculating processed \nwater), and separator system with primary centrifugal separator (hydro-pulper) and \nsecondary separator (charge tank with hydro-cyclone)); DTX-211 at 327 (showing \nVasteras facility with hopper equivalent (walking floor and deep bunker), wash \nwater tank, and separator system with primary centrifugal separator and secondary \nseparator (screen rake and sand trap)); DTX-90 at 5 (2008 EPA report showing \nEBMUD facility with hopper, wash water dilution liquid, primary separator (rock \ntrap) and secondary separator (paddle finisher)); DTX-138 at 1, 10 (showing that \nEBMUD's secondary separator had multiple screen sizes). \n74) Based on Dr. Gidda's credible testimony, I find that the inventive \nfeature of the system covered by claim 16 of the #841 patent was the make-up \nproduct tank element (16( e )), which enabled the injection of collected waste into a \nproduct tank containing different waste material, and that this feature was not \ndepicted in the December 4, 2009 drawings or in the wet and dry systems that \nDODA operated in Rivalta, Italy as of 2009, all of which only had a single product \ntank. See Tr. 853: 11-854: 1, 854:7-20 (Gidda). I also find that the four-tank \n35 system-in which two tanks filled with make-up water or wash water are \nconnected to a wash water pump and two product tanks-appeared for the first \ntime in the drawings Denson sent to DODA in January 2010 that were later \nincorporated into the diagrams that Ada Doda sent to Denson on February 11, \n2010. Tr. 857:5-19, 860:8-861:14 (Gidda); see JTX-7, JTX-8, DTX-130. \n75) I also find, based on Dr. Gidda's credible testimony, that DODA's \nsingle-tank system could not practice the challenged claims or solve the problem \naddressed by the patents because it could not blend different materials of varying \nchemical makeups into a consistent, low-COD bio-slurry. See Tr. 854:21-855 :4 \n(Gidda). \n76) It is possible to practice the claims of the #841 patent with equipment \nfrom vendors other than DODA, and as of 2009, several known organic waste \nprocessing facilities were practicing elements of the First and Second Disclosed \nCombinations using hoppers and tanks provided by vendors other than DODA. Tr. \n865:6-10, 869:4-17, 879:4-19 (Gidda). \n77) It would have been obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill as of late \n2009 to use a wash water liquid tank to dilute material. Tr. 874:9-875:24, 882:5-\n17 (Gidda). \n36 78) The use of different screen sizes in separators as of December 2009 \nwas common in the waste processing industry and would have been obvious to an \nartisan of ordinary skill. Tr. 884:7-885: 18, 890: 12-24 (Gidda). \n79) I found Dr. Gidda's opinions more credible than those of Dr. Smith \nbecause of Dr. Gidda's extensive experience in the waste processing industry and \nhis forthright and cogent answers to questions at trial. Dr. Gidda explained in \ndetail how the multi-tank system is necessary to practice the claims at issue and \nhow known facilities practiced elements of the First and Second Disclosed \nCombinations as of December 2009. In sum, I credit his testimony and find that \neven if Marco Doda had originated the ideas of a waste water tank, secondary \nhopper, and secondary hopper with an eight-millimeter screen, DODA did not \nshow by clear and convincing evidence that Marco Doda made a significant \ncontribution to the conception of the invention covered by claim 16 of the #841 \npatent (and claim 1 of the #995 patent). (I make no such finding with respect to \nclaims 21 and 26 of the #841 patent, as they are separate inventions from claim 16, \nsee, e.g., Jones v. Hardy, 121 F.2d 1524, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (\"[E]ach claim \nmust be considered as defining a separate invention.\"), and therefore a secondary \nseparator necessarily is a significant contribution to claim 21 and a secondary \n37 separator with an eight-millimeter screen is necessarily a significant contribution to \nclaim 26.) \nII. PLAINTIFFS' JOINT INVENTORSHIP CLAIM \nA. Legal Standards \n\"[A] joint invention is simply the product of a collaboration between two or \nmore persons working together to solve the problem addressed.\" Fina Oil & \nChem. Co. v. Ewen, 123 F.3d 1466, 1473 (Fed. Cir. 1997). To be considered a \njoint inventor, \none must: ( 1) contribute in some significant manner to \nthe conception or reduction to practice of the invention, \n(2) make a contribution to the claimed invention that is \nnot insignificant in quality, when that contribution is \nmeasured against the dimension of the full invention, and \n(3) do more than merely explain to the real inventors \nwell-known concepts and/or the current state of the art. \nDana-Farber Cancer Inst. v. Ono Pharm. Co., 964 F.3d 1365, 1371 (Fed. Cir. \n2020) (internal citations omitted). Conception is the \"formation in the mind of the \ninventor, of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention, \nas it is hereafter to be applied in practice.\" Stern v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., 434 \nF.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). \"[A]n inventive act\" is \nrequired to be named as a joint inventor. Fina Oil, 123 F.3d at 1473. A \ncombination of known elements is inventive only when the combination is both \nnovel and non-obvious. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102-103. \n38 \"A party seeking correction of inventorship must provide clear and \nconvincing evidence of inventorship.\" Linear Tech. Corp. v. Impala Linear Corp., \n379 F.3d 1311, 1318-19 (Fed. Cir. 2004). To meet that burden: \nalleged co-inventors must prove their contribution to the \nconception with more than their own testimony \nconcerning the relevant facts. Whether [a] co-inventor's \ntestimony has been sufficiently corroborated is evaluated \nunder a rule of reason analysis, which requires that an \nevaluation of all pertinent evidence must be made so that \na sound determination of the credibility of the inventor's \nstory may be reached. Corroborating evidence may take \nmany forms. Reliable evidence of corroboration \npreferably comes in the form of records made \ncontemporaneously with the inventive \nprocess. Circumstantial evidence of an independent \nnature may also corroborate. Additionally, oral \ntestimony from someone other than the alleged inventor \nmay corroborate. \nId. at 1327 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nB. Discussion \nPlaintiffs argue that Marco Doda should be added as co-inventor on the #841 \nand #995 patents because he provided Denson and Waste Management with the \nFirst Disclosed Combination and the Second Disclosed Combination. I have \nalready found as a factual matter that Plaintiffs failed to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that Marco Doda conceived of these combinations or any of \ntheir elements. Accordingly, as a matter of law, Defendants have not established \n39 that Marco Doda is a co-inventor of the claimed inventions of the #841 and #995 \npatents. \nIII. PLAINTIFFS' BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM \nA. Legal Standards \nThe parties agree that Delaware law governs Plaintiffs' contract claim. \nUnder Delaware law, the elements of a contract claim are: (1) a contractual \nobligation; (2) breach of that obligation by the defendant; and (3) resulting damage \nto the plaintiff. Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, LLC, 971 A.2d 872, 883 (Del. Ch. \n2009). \nB. Discussion \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants breached the confidentiality provision of \nthe 2010 NOA-under which the parties may not disclose to third parties \ninformation marked \"'Confidential,' 'Proprietary,' or [with] some similar \ndesignation\"-when Denson disclosed the May 25, 2011 drawing in Figure 6 of \nDenson's June 2011 patent application. See D.I. 205 at 27-28. I have already \nfound as a factual matter, however, that neither the May 2011 drawing nor any \nother document in JTX-14 is marked \"Confidential,\" \"Proprietary,\" or with a \nsimilar designation that would have put Waste Management or Denson on notice \nthat DODA considered the drawing in question to be confidential or proprietary. \nBecause the document that Denson disclosed (the May 25, 2011 drawing) was not \n40 confidential according to the terms of the NDA, Defendants cannot have breached \nthe confidentiality provision in the NOA by disclosing that document. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs' contract claim fails as a matter of law. \nIV.
