(D.I. 13) For\nthe following reasons, is it recommended that the court DENY Defendant\u2019s Motion.\nIll. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff is an information technology company which provides and sells cloud services\nto improve information security and management. (D.I. 12 at 2) Plaintiff developed the cloud\nservice offering \u201cIAM Advantage\u201d with the intention of selling it to the Department of Defense\n(\u201cDOD\u201d) and other governmental agencies to address their user identity and access management\nconcerns. (Id. at [] 7-9)\n\nBefore the technology could be purchased by the government, Plaintiff needed to\ncomplete and pass an assessment performed by a third-party assessment organization (\u201c3PAO\u201d)\n\nto obtain an authorization to operate pursuant to the Federal Risk and Authorization Management\n\n' The briefing for the Motion is as follows: Defendant\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 14), Plaintiff's\nanswering brief (D.I. 17), and Defendant\u2019s reply brief (D.I. 19).\nProgram (\u201cFedRAMP\u201d). (id. at \u00a7f 10, 13) FedRAMP is a government-wide program that\nestablishes the mandatory levels of security requirements for cloud services, classifying them at\nLow, Moderate, and High risk impact levels or \u201cbaselines.\u201d (/d. at f\u00a7 11-12)\n\nIn addition to FedRAMP, the Plaintiff had to satisfy the more stringent security\nrequirements of the DOD\u2019s Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (\u201cDOD SRG\u201d) to\nobtain an authorization necessary for providing services to DOD customers. (Jd. at {J 16-20)\nFor example, to obtain an authorization to operate in the DOD SRG Impact Level 5 (\u201cILS\u201d)\nenvironment, the provider\u2019s proposed cloud service must be assessed by an approved 3PAO and\nthe Defense Information Systems Agency (\u201cDISA\u201d) Cloud Security Control Assessor (\u201cSCA\u201d).\n(Id. at\u00a721) The cloud services offering must satisfy both the FedRAMP High baseline and the\nadditional DOD SRG IL5 requirements. (/d.)\n\nThe security audit by the 3PAO results in completion of a Readiness Assessment Report\n(\u201cRAR\u201d). Ud. at J] 14-15) The RAR contains a summary of the cloud service provider\u2019s ability\nto satisfy the security requirements. (/d. at | 15) The 3PAO submits the RAR to the DISA SCA\nwho reviews it for compliance before a cloud service provider obtains an authorization to operate\nits program. (/d. at ]23) A cloud service provider cannot offer its program for a DOD customer\nif it fails the RAR. (Id. at { 24)\n\nWhen the DOD expressed interest in IAM Advantage, the Plaintiff met with the\nDefendant for an initial presentation in November of 2019. (/d. at J] 9, 37) Defendant provides\na Compliance Automation Platform for FedRAMP. (Id. at ]27) Defendant claims its platform\nis \u201cdesigned to dramatically accelerate [the] Fe\u20acRAMP Authorization process.\u201d (/d.)\n\nFollowing a series of meetings and communications with the Defendant in 2020 and\n\n2021, the Plaintiff contracted with the Defendant for services that would prepare the Plaintiff to\nbecome \u201caudit ready\u201d under the FedRAMP Moderate baseline. (/d. at J] 38-50) The parties\nsigned a Master Services Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) accompanied by a \u201cModerate Proposal\u201d on March\n31, 2021. Ud. at J] 6, 51) Despite its awareness that Defendant\u2019s performance under the\nModerate Proposal was inconsistent with Defendant\u2019s prior promises and assurances about its\ncapabilities, Plaintiff entered into an addendum to the MSA with the Defendant known as the\n\u201cHigh Proposal\u201d on May 31, 2021, to become audit-ready for the FedRAMP High baseline and\nDOD SRG ILS environment. (Jd. at [J 72, 75, 94)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that it was induced to enter into the initial agreements because of the\nDefendant\u2019s numerous pre-contractual assurances that it possessed the resources, tools,\nexperience, and technical expertise to enable Plaintiff to become audit-ready for the security\nassessment. (/d. at J 1, 37-50) Plaintiff contends that Defendant represented that it had\nmultiple customers audit-ready for Fe\u20ac(RAMP Moderate and \u201ccustomers who jump right to\n[DOD SRG] IL5 out of the box.\u201d (Jd. at Ff] 32-33, 40-41, 64)\n\nPlaintiff claims soon after the execution of the MSA, it became aware of inconsistencies\nbetween Defendant\u2019s assurances and its performance and pointed them out to the Defendant. (Id.\nat {J 89-91) Defendant\u2019s Founder and Chief Technical Officer, Andrew Plato, admitted\nDefendant\u2019s prior representations were false and exaggerated but gave new assurances that the\nproblems would be corrected. (Jd. at \u00a7{] 64-66, 94) Thus, the Plaintiff alleges it was further\ninduced to maintain and expand the scope of services under the contract in reliance upon\nDefendant\u2019s alleged new false representations that it could successfully provide the services\npromised. (/d. at J] 70, 72) Plaintiff further alleges the Defendant\u2019s inadequacy, inexperience,\n\nlack of resources and numerous delays throughout the process caused Plaintiff to fail the required\nassessments, re-submit for new assessments, and incur significant financial costs. (See e.g., id. at\nGf 1, 127, 161-62, 184, 186)\n\nOn January 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant alleging breach of contract\n(Count I) and fraud in the inducement (Count II). (D.I. 1) The court has subject matter\njurisdiction based on diversity pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a), as the Plaintiff is a Virginia\ncorporation and the Defendant is a Delaware corporation. (D.I. 12 at ] 4)\n\nOn February 14, 2022, Defendant moved to dismiss the original Complaint. (D.I. 8)\nPlaintiff responded by filing the FAC on March 23, 2022. (D.I. 12) On April 1, 2022,\nDefendant filed the present Motion. (D.I. 13)\n\nTil. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Umiand v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542 F.3d 59,\n64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\n\nalleged. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679.\n\nFor fraud claims there is a heightened pleading requirement. \u201c[A] party must state with\nparticularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). To satisfy this standard,\nthe plaintiff must plead or allege the date, time and place of the alleged fraud.\u201d Frederico v.\nHome Depot, 507 F.3d 188, 200 (3d Cir. 2007).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. The MSA? Does Not Contain a Clear and Unambiguous Anti-Reliance\nProvision\n\nThe court considers the language of the MSA integral to the pleadings and interprets it in\n\naccordance with Delaware law.\n\n2 On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court may consider \u201cdocument[s] integral\nto or explicitly relied upon in the complaint\u201d without converting the motion into one for\nsummary judgment. In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1426. The MSA,\nModerate and High Proposals were attached to the Defendant\u2019s opening brief and their\nprovisions are cited in the FAC. (D.I. 14, Ex. 1; see e.g., DL. 12 at 49 51, 58-61, 73)\n\n3 The MSA contains a Delaware forum selection clause and provides that the contract \u201cshall be\ngoverned by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.\u201d (D.I. 14, Ex.\n1 at \u00a7 2.19)\nDefendant argues that anti-reliance language in the MSA precludes Plaintiff from basing\na fraud in the inducement claim on extra-contractual representations. (D.I. 14 at 11-12)\nDefendant contends section 2.21 (the \u201cintegration clause\u201d) and section 2.5 (the \u201cwarranty\nclause\u201d) of the MSA together preclude Plaintiffs reliance on representations outside of the\ncontract. (/d. at 13-14) The integration clause states:\n\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties as to\nthe subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior representations, proposals,\ndiscussions, and communications whether oral or in writing.\n\n(DI. 14, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 2.21)\nThe relevant portions of the warranty clause provide as follows:\n\n[Defendant] represents that: (a) it and each of its employees, consultants and\nsubcontractors performing Services possesses the required skills to provide and perform\nthe Services in accordance with this Agreement and the Proposal; and (b) the Services\nwill be performed for and delivered to [Plaintiff] in strict conformance with the Proposal,\nin a diligent, workmanlike manner and in accordance with industry standards, laws and\ngovernmental regulations expressly applicable to the performance of such Services.\n\n[J\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, [Plaintiff] understands and acknowledges that it is not\nalways feasible for [Defendant] and each of its employees, consultants, and\nsubcontractors to possess complete knowledge of all possible implementations of a\nparticular third-party application(s) and that of the [Plaintiff's] application(s). [Plaintiff]\nagrees to reasonably explain the unique designs, usage, and configurations of any\nrelevant technology or methodology used in [Plaintiff's] business if and as requested by\n[Defendant] in writing to ensure that [Defendant] and its agents are able to properly fulfill\nthe terms outlined in a Proposal.\n\n[J\n\nTHE FOREGOING PROVISIONS ARE EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL\nOTHER WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF\nMECHANTABILITY [sic] OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY\nWARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n[Defendant] provides no other warranties with respect to the Services and Deliverables\nthan those expressly set forth in this Section[.]\n(Ud. at \u00a7 2.5) (emphasis in original)\n\nPlaintiff argues that the integration and warranty clauses in the MSA do not clearly and\nunambiguously preclude Plaintiff's reliance on Defendant\u2019s extra-contractual statements that\ninduced it to enter the contract. (D.I. 17 at 10-12)\n\nTo preclude a fraud in the inducement claim, \u201cthe contract must contain language that,\nwhen read together, can be said to add up to a clear anti-reliance clause by which the plaintiff has\ncontractually promised that it did not rely upon statements outside the contract's four corners.\u201d\nKronenberg v. Katz, 872 A.2d 568, 593 (Del. Ch. 2004). While \u201cDelaware law does not require\nmagic words,\u201d the intent to disclaim reliance on representations outside of the contract needs to\nbe clear and unambiguous. Prairie Capital III, L.P. v. Double E Holding Corp., 132 A.3d 35, 51\n(Del. Ch. 2015); see also MidCap Funding X Trust v. Graebel Companies, Inc., No. 2018-0312-\nMTZ, 2020 WL 2095899, at *19 (Del. Ch. Apr. 30, 2020) (stating the contract must \u201cidentify the\nspecific information on which a party has relied and which foreclose reliance on other\ninformation\u201d).\n\nDefendant argues the MSA contains anti-reliance language similar to the anti-reliance\nprovisions enforced by the court in Prairie Capital III, L.P. and MidCap Funding X Trust, thus,\nbarring Plaintiff's fraud in the inducement claim. (D.I. 14 at 12-15)\n\nIn Prairie Capital IIT, L.P., the court found the contract precluded plaintiff's extra-\ncontractual fraud claim because the contract contained clear anti-reliance language. 132 A.3d at\n50. In addition to the integration clause, the contract contained an exclusive representations\nclause, which stated:\n\nThe [plaintiff] has relied on (a) the results of its own independent investigation and (b)\n\nthe representations and warranties of the [defendant] expressly and specifically set forth\nin this Agreement, including the Schedules. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND\nWARRANTIES BY THE [DEFENDANT] CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND\n\nEXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE [DEFENDANT]\n\nTO THE [PLAINTIFF] IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, AND THE\n\n[PLAINTIFF] UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES, AND AGREES THAT ALL\n\nOTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ... ARE SPECIFICALLY\n\nDISCLAIMED BY THE [DEFENDANT].\n\nId. (emphasis in original).\n\nSimilarly, in MidCap Funding X Trust, the court found anti-reliance language because the\nrelevant provision stated: \u201cEach and every one of the parties hereto further expressly agrees and\nacknowledges that it is not entering into this Agreement in reliance upon any representations,\npromises or assurance other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.\u201d 2020 WL\n2095899, at *7.\n\nUnlike Prairie Capital III, L.P. and MidCap Funding X Trust, the integration and\nwarranty clauses of the MSA fail to explicitly address reliance on representations. Defendant\nadmits that the standard integration clause of section 2.21 is not sufficient on its own to preclude\nreliance. (D.I. 19 at 3-4; see D.I. 14, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 2.21) See Kronenberg, 872 A.2d at 593 (\u201cThe\npresence of a standard integration clause alone . . . will not suffice to bar fraud claims.\u201d).\n\nIn furtherance of its anti-reliance argument, Defendant relies on the warranty provisions\nin section 2.5. (D.I. 14 at 13-14) This provision purports to disclaim all other warranties outside\n\nof those expressed in section 2.5 and provides the sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the\n\nlimited warranty.\u2019 (D.I. 14, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 2.5) Defendant argues this limited warranty provision in\n\n4 The relevant part of the warranty clause states: \u201cIf the Deliverables do not meet the\nspecifications or requirements expressly described in the Proposal, the [Plaintiff] will notify\n[Defendant] in writing within thirty (30) business days[.] . . . [Defendant] will immediately re-\nperform all non-conforming Services and/or replace, repair, or return all non-conforming\nDeliverables. [Plaintiff] agrees that the foregoing represents [Plaintiff's] sole and exclusive\nremedy for any failure of the Services and/or Deliverables to meet the limited warranty provided\nin this Section[.] . . . [Defendant] provides no other warranties with respect to the Services and\n\n8\nconjunction with the integration clause, amounts to a clear and unambiguous anti-reliance\nprovision. (D.I. 14 at 13-14)\n\nDefendant\u2019s argument fails because it provides no authority for finding the warranty\ndisclaimer is the equivalent of an anti-reliance provision precluding a fraud claim. The provision\narguably disclaims other warranties but fails to clearly and unambiguously express that the\nPlaintiff disclaims reliance on prior representations, nor does it set forth what, if anything, the\nparties relied upon in executing the MSA.\n\nPlaintiff further argues that section 2.12 explicitly accounts for the viability of fraud\nclaims. (D.I. 17 at 12-13) Section 2.12 states in relevant part:\n\nNOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL LIMIT OR EXCLUDE A PARTY\u2019S\n\nLIABILITY FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL\n\nMISCONDUCT OF SUCH PARTY OR ITS EMPLOYEES[.]\n\n(DI. 14, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 2.12) (emphasis in original) The Defendant has failed to address this\nargument in its reply brief. (See D.I. 19) It has not explained how the court could find clear and\nunambiguous anti-reliance language when the MSA expressly preserves liability for fraud.\n\nBased upon the foregoing, it is recommended that the court find the integration and\nwarranty clauses do not amount to a clear and unambiguous anti-reliance provision precluding\nPlaintiff's claim for fraud in the inducement. See Lieberman v. BeyondTrust Corp., No. 19-\n1730-RGA, 2020 WL 1815547, at *2 (D. Del. Apr. 9, 2020) (finding no anti-reliance provision\nbecause the party \u201cdid not affirmatively promise not to rely on such representations\u201d).\n\nMoreover, the Plaintiff claims that even if there were anti-reliance language in the MSA,\n\nthe presence of a contractual fraud claim precludes dismissal of Count IJ. (D.I. 17 at 15-16)\n\nDeliverables than those expressly set forth in this Section[.]\u201d (D.I. 14, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 2.5) (emphasis\nadded)\nThe warranty clause states: \u201c[Defendant] and each of its employees, consultants and\nsubcontractors performing Services possesses the required skills to provide and perform the\nServices in accordance with this Agreement and the Proposal.\u201d (D.I. 14, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 2.5) Plaintiff\nargues these representations were false \u201cas \u2018[Defendant] and its agent both lacked the required\nskills to furnish the Services.\u201d\u201d (D.I. 17 at 16 (quoting D.I. 12 at | 58); see also D.I. 12 at \u00a7\u00a5 1,\n186, 188, 191-92)\n\nDefendant argues such statements cannot support a contractual fraud claim because any\nalleged breach of the misrepresentations in section 2.5 concerning Defendant\u2019s knowledge and\nskill would only support a claim for breach of warranty, not fraud. (D.I. 14 at 16) Furthermore,\nwithout citing any supporting authority in the record, Defendant argues for dismissal of Count II\non the basis that the Plaintiff asserts a fraud claim to avoid the limited damages remedy in the\ncontract. (/d.)\n\nOn a motion to dismiss, the court must accept the facially plausible allegations as true\nand view them in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. The court will not address\nDefendant\u2019s factual attack on the merits of Plaintiffs claims. Therefore, the court recommends\ndenial of the Motion to dismiss the contractual fraud claims.\n\nB. Plaintiff Has Plausibly Pled Fraud in the Inducement\n\nTo plead fraud in the inducement, a plaintiff must allege:\n\n(1) a false representation of material fact; (2) the defendant's knowledge of or belief as to\n\nthe falsity of the representation or the defendant's reckless indifference to the truth of the\n\nrepresentation; (3) the defendant's intent to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from\nacting; (4) the plaintiff's action or inaction taken in justifiable reliance upon the\nrepresentation; and (5) damage to the plaintiff as a result of such reliance.\n\nEl v. Davis, No. 12-1580-GMS, 2013 WL 1914233, at *2 (D. Del. May 7, 2013).\n\n10\nHere, the Defendant argues that the allegations of the FAC amount to no more than a\nbreach of contract claim for Defendant\u2019s misrepresentation of its ability to perform its\nobligations under the contract. (D.I. 14 at 15-16) Defendant seeks dismissal of Count II\nbecause a plaintiff cannot \u201cbootstrap a breach of contract claim into a [fraud] claim by intoning\nthe prima facie elements of the tort while telling the story of the defendant's failure to perform\nunder the contract.\u201d Voterlabs, Inc. v. Ethos Grp. Consulting Servs., LLC, No. 19-524-RGA-\nSRF, 2020 WL 6131760, at *9 (D. Del. Oct. 19, 2020), report and recommendation adopted,\n2020 WL 10622570 (D. Del. Dec. 4, 2020).\n\nA fraud claim \u201cmust set out \u2018the who, what, when, where and how of the events at issue\u2019\nor otherwise inject precision or some measure of substantiation into its allegations.\u201d\nFinancialApps, LLC v. Envestnet, Inc., No. 19-1337-CFC-CJB, 2020 WL 4569466, at *6 (D.\nDel. July 30, 2020) (citation omitted); see also Frederico, 507 F.3d at 200. In cases where\ninformation lies outside of the plaintiffs control, a plaintiff may allege a defendant\u2019s state of\nmind \u201cupon information and belief.\u201d Brinkmeier v. BIC Corp., 733 F. Supp. 2d 552, 559 (D.\nDel. 2010); see also In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1418 (noting the\nparticularity standard is \u201crelaxed\u201d when the factual information is in the defendant\u2019s knowledge\nor control).\n\nDefendant argues the Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged Defendant\u2019s knowledge and\nintent to defraud or Plaintiff's justifiable reliance. (D.I. 14 at 16-22) In addition, Defendant\nargues that optimistic statements about future success cannot support a fraud in the inducement\n\nclaim. (Id. at 22-23)\n\n11\n1. The FAC Plausibly Alleges Knowledge and Intent to Defraud\nDefendant contends the Plaintiff has not satisfied the heightened Rule 9(b) pleading\n\nstandard because the Plaintiff asserts conclusory allegations of Defendant\u2019s knowledge and\nintent \u201cupon information and belief\u201d without identifying specific facts upon which the belief is\nbased. (/d. at 16-20) In response, Plaintiff argues that general averments of Defendant\u2019s state of\nmind are allowed under Rule 9(b), and when information is outside of Plaintiff's control it may\nplead facts based upon \u201cinformation and belief.\u201d (D.I. 17 at 18)\n\nDefendant contests the merits of the allegations, calling them internally inconsistent and\nimplausible. At this stage of the proceedings, the court must view the FAC in the light favorable\nto the Plaintiff and determine whether it states a plausible claim for which discovery is\nwarranted. Whether the non-moving party can ultimately prevail on the merits is not an issue for\nthe court to resolve at this stage.\n\nDefendant\u2019s reliance on Kuhn Const. Co. v. Diamond State Port Corp., No. 10-637-SLR,\n2011 WL 1576691 (D. Del. Apr. 26, 2011) (\u201cKuhn P\u2019) and Kuhn Const. Co. v. Ocean and\nCoastal Consultants, Inc., 844 F. Supp. 2d 519 (D. Del. 2012) (\u201cKuhn IP\u2019) is misplaced. (D.I. 14\nat 16-18) In Kuhn I, the court dismissed the plaintiff's fraud claim because the plaintiff failed to\nallege the defendant\u2019s state of mind nor did the plaintiff allege that the content of the\nrepresentations were false. 2011 WL 1576691, at *9-10. In Kuhn II, the court dismissed the\nplaintiff's fraud claim because the plaintiff did not allege \u201cwhat motivation [the defendant]\nwould have for making [the] knowingly false representations.\u201d 844 F. Supp. 2d at 530.\n\nUnlike Kuhn I & II, the FAC describes the content of the representations, explains why\nthey were false, and addresses how such conduct amounts to fraudulent inducement. For\n\nexample, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant\u2019s representations that it had customers who started with\n\n12\nFedRAMP Moderate and DOD SRG ILS were false. (D.I. 12 at {{ 40-41) Plaintiff also alleges\nthat Defendant\u2019s representations about having scripts, automation, and templates were false. (/d.\nat J] 45-48) Finally, Plaintiff alleges it relied on these representations. (Id. at | 50)\nFurthermore, the Plaintiff sufficiently alleged the Defendant\u2019s motive in making these allegedly\nfalse representations was to secure and retain Plaintiff as a customer. (/d. at {J 72, 153, 191).\n\nAdditionally, the FAC contains plausible averments that the Defendant knew or believed\nits representations were false. For example, Andrew Plato, Defendant\u2019s Founder and Chief\nTechnical Officer, admitted Defendant\u2019s executives provided Plaintiff with false and exaggerated\nrepresentations. (/d. at 67; see also id. at { 109 (alleging that Defendant admitted \u201cto not\nhaving the necessary product experience to resolve issues surrounding misconfiguration\u201d)) The\nFAC also alleges that Plaintiff expressed its concerns to Defendant on multiple occasions about\nits misleading representations, so the Defendant knew or should have known its representations\nwere false. (See e.g., id. at FJ 91, 94, 187; see also id. at | 92 (alleging that Defendant \u201cwas\naware of the discrepancies between what its delivery team could actually deliver and the solution\npromises made by [Defendant\u2019s] sales and senior executive teams\u201d))\n\nPlaintiff's allegations in the FAC are sufficient to satisfy the Rule 9(b) pleading standard\nfor allegations based \u201cupon information and belief\u201d because the FAC sets forth specific facts\nupon which the belief is reasonably based. Defendant\u2019s state of mind has been plausibly pled.\nFor example, Plaintiff alleges that admissions by Defendant\u2019s key personnel concerning its level\nof experience and resources were false and were intended to induce the Plaintiff to enter into the\ncontract with the Defendant. (See id. at {] 38-85). See FinancialApps, LLC, 2020 WL 4569466,\n\nat *7 (finding the defendant\u2019s mental state may be alleged generally and the plaintiff's\n\n13\nallegations of who made the statements and that the defendant knew them to be false were\nsufficient at the motion to dismiss stage).\n2. The FAC Plausibly Alleges Plaintiff's Justifiable Reliance\nDefendant asserts three arguments for dismissal of the FAC based on Plaintiff's failure to\n\nplead justifiable reliance. First, Defendant contends that the warranty clause of the MSA limits\nthe Defendant\u2019s representations and warranties. (D.I. 14 at 21) The warranty clause provides:\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, [Plaintiff] understands and acknowledges that it is not\n\nalways feasible for [Defendant] and each of its employees, consultants, and\n\nsubcontractors to possess complete knowledge of all possible implementations of a\n\nparticular third-party application(s) and that of the [Plaintiff's] application(s).\n(D.I. 14, Ex. 1 at \u00a7 2.5) The provision further states that the Plaintiff will \u201creasonably explain\u201d\ntechnological details \u201cif and as requested\u201d by Defendant so that the Defendant can \u201cproperly\nfulfill the [contract.]\u201d (id.) The language of the warranty clause does not support Defendant\u2019s\nargument. Such language evinces the parties\u2019 intent to ensure the contractual goals are met. It\ndoes not state that Plaintiff agreed not to rely on representations made by the Defendant.\n\nDefendant\u2019s second argument points to inconsistencies in allegations of justifiable\n\nreliance in the FAC. The Defendant disputes Plaintiff's claim it lacked knowledge of the\nDefendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations because it was the one who \u201cprovided [Defendant] with\nthe necessary training, documents, and maintenance.\u201d (D.I. 14 at 21) However, as stated supra,\nthe MSA provides for the Plaintiff to \u201creasonably explain\u201d its technology. (D.I. 14, Ex. 1 at \u00a7\n2.5) This provision says nothing about reliance nor does it state that the Plaintiff's agreement to\nprovide training, documents or other assistance was at the expense of foreclosing reliance on any\nother representations about the Defendant\u2019s ability to perform the contract. Furthermore,\nDefendant seeks dismissal of Count II based upon its contention that the FAC contains factual\n\ninconsistencies. The court will not resolve factual disputes on a motion to dismiss.\n\n14\nDefendant\u2019s final argument is that the Plaintiff could not have justifiably relied on\nDefendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations because it knew of Defendant\u2019s numerous performance\nshortcomings yet entered into another agreement for Defendant\u2019s services covering more\nstringent cloud service security requirements. (D.I. 14 at 21-22; D.I. 19 at 7) The parties did not\ninclude language based upon any such new representations in the High Proposal addendum to the\nMSA. (See D.I. 14, Ex. 1)\n\nThis argument also challenges the merits of the factual allegations. On a motion to\ndismiss, the court must view the allegations in the light favorable to the plaintiff. When viewed\nin that light, the FAC plausibly pleads that Defendant\u2019s representations about its success\nproviding similar services for other customers, its resources and capabilities to enable Plaintiff to\nattain audit-readiness, and its assurances that it would correct problems going forward were\nintended to induce the Plaintiff to enter into the MSA and subsequent addendum. (See e.g., D.I.\n12 at FJ 40-50, 64-72)\n\n3. Defendant Improperly Seeks a Factual Determination Regarding Optimistic\nStatements About Future Success\n\nFinally, Defendant argues the Plaintiff's allegations related to the Defendant\u2019s alleged\nfalse representations of its skill and expertise cannot support a fraud in the inducement claim\nbecause such statements are nothing more than optimistic marketing statements or expressions of\nconfidence in its capabilities. (D.I. 14 at 22-23)\n\nBeyond reciting the law, the Defendant fails to support its position. (/d. at 22) Further,\nin Clark v. Davenport, the court found the defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct support[ed] an inference that he\nintended to deceive [the plaintiff], rendering his statements [regarding future prospects]\nactionable at the pleading stage.\u201d No. 2017-0839-JTL, 2019 WL 3230928, at *12 (Del. Ch. Jul.\n\n18, 2019).\n\n15\nThe Defendant\u2019s argument asks the court to examine the merits of the allegations and\nconclude that they are \u201cpuffery\u201d not false representations. The court will not conduct a fact-\nbased analysis on a motion to dismiss.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is recommended that the court DENY Defendant\u2019s Motion.\n(D.I. 13) This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written\nobjections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and\nRecommendation. Fed. R.

Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv.
