Neff, \nCarmit P. Neff, James K. Neff Revocable Trust Dated 11/15/12, Carmit P. Neff Revocable Trust \ndated 11/15/12, WGA Trust Dated 8/16/13, and John Does 1\u201310 (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) .  \nPlaintiffs allege , among other things, that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA , \ncausing damage to the ir retirement plan, and Plaintiffs seek relief for and on behalf of the plan \nunder 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1109(a) and 1132(a)(2).   2 Pending before the Court is Defendants\u2019 Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Stay \nP\nursuant to Sections 3 and 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act, or, in the Alternative, to Dismi ss.  (D.I. \n24.)  Although \u00a7 1132(a)(2) permits plan beneficiar ies such as Plaintiffs  to seek relief on behalf of \nthe plan as a whole, the  arbitration provision at issue in this case purports to bar  Plaintiffs from \nseeking relief for the plan as a whol e.  Because that portion of the arbitration provision is invalid \nand is not severable from the remainder of the arbitration provision, Defendants\u2019 motion to compel \narbitration should be DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUNDThis case involves an employee stock ownership plan ( \u201cESOP\u201d).  An ESOP is a type of\nERISA -regulated defined contribution plan \u201cdesigned to invest primarily in qualifying employer \nsecurities.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1107(d)(6), 1002(34).   \nPlaintiffs  are all  current employees  of Western Global Airlines, Inc . and have pa rticipa ted \nin the company\u2019s  ESOP (the \u201c Plan\u201d) since its inception in 2020.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 33\u201335.)   The exact \ndetails of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations  aren\u2019t germane to resolving the present motion , but their general \nclaim is that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Plan by causing it to pay more for shares of Western Global Airlines than the shares were actually  worth.  Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint seeks  \n\u201crecovery on behalf of the Plan \u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 1132(a)(2) and 1109(a).  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 115 \u201317.)  As explained \nfurther below, \u00a7 1109(a) says that a plan fiduciary who breaches a fiduciary duty listed in \u00a7\u00a7 1101\u20131114 shall be liable to the plan \u201cfor any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach\u201d and subject to equitable relief.  Section 1132(a)(2) says that a beneficiary of a plan can bring a civil \naction in district court for appropriate relief under \u00a7 1109.\n1    \n1 Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint indicated  that they were \u201cadditionally and alterna tively\u201d seeking to \npursue their claims \u201cas a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 .\u201d  (D.I. 1  \n\u00b6\u00b6 118 \u201327.)  However, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel took the position at oral argument that their  claims for 3 The Complaint has  a  lengthy prayer for relief.  Among other things, it seeks to order \nDefendants to make good to the Plan the losses resulting from the breaches  of fiduciary duties \nunder ERISA and to disgorge any profits they made through the use of Plan assets.  ( Id. \u00b6 177(F), \n(H), (I).)  It also se eks to remove the Plan trustees  and to enjoin the Neffs from serving the Plan in \nany fiduciary capacity , as well as certain other equita ble and declaratory relief .  (Id. \u00b6 177(J),  (L); \nsee also id. \u00b6 177.)   \nThe Plan is governed by an instrument that  the parties refer to as the  \u201cPlan Document.\u201d 1F2  \n(D.I. 26, Ex. A.)  It has a lengthy arbitration provision, which provides , in pertinent part, as follows:  \n18.7  Mandatory and Binding Arbitration Procedure \n(\u201cArbitration Procedure\u201d) . As a  condition to (i) any \nEmployee becoming eligible to participate in the Plan, (ii) any  \nEmployee, Participant, or Beneficiary continuing to \nparticipate in the Plan, (iii) any  Claimant asserting a claim \nrelated to the Plan or any benefits under the Plan, (iv) any  \nEmployee, Participant, or Beneficiary receiving any contributions to his or her Plan account, and/or (v) any \nEmployee, Participant, or Beneficiary receiving any benefit \nunder this Plan, such Employee, Participant, or Beneficiary \nshall be bound, and hereby is bound, to follow and comply \nwith the provisions of this Arbitration Procedure to resolve all  \nCovered Claims.  \n(a\n)Covered Claims.  Any claim by a Claimant which arises out\nof, relates to, or concerns  this Plan  . . . , including without\nlimitation  . . . any claim asserting a breach of  . . . any provision\nof ERISA . . . , including without limitation claims for breach\nof fiduc iary duty, . . . (collectively, \u201cCovered Claims \u201d), shall\nbe settled by binding arbitration administered in accordancewith the National Rules  for the Resolution of  Employment\nDisputes of the American Arbitration Association  (\u201cAAA\u201d )\nthen in effect. Under no circumstances are the AAA\nrelief on behalf of the Plan under \u00a7 1132(a)(2) did not require them to proceed as a class.  (Tr. 33\u2013\n36.) \n2 Defendants filed a copy of the Plan Document with their motion to compel arbitration .  (D.I. \n26, Ex. A.)  Defendants contend, and Plaintiffs do not dispute, that it is authentic and that the Court may properly consider it.   4 \n Supplementary Rules  for Class Arbitrations to be used . . . . \nThe judgment on the final award . . . shall not have any binding \neffect on the Administrator or Trustee except as to the  \nindividual Claimant only.  \n \n(b) No Group, Class, or Representative Arbitrations. All \nCovered Claims must be  brought solely in the Claimant \u2019s \nindividual capacity and not in a representative  capacity or on \na class, collective, or group basis. Each arbitration shall be \nlimited  solely to one Claimant \u2019s Covered Claims and that \nClaimant may not seek or receive  any remedy which has the \npurpose or effect of providing additional benefits or  monetary \nor other relief to any Employee, Participant or Beneficiary other than the  Claimant.  For instance, with respect to any \nclaim brought under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2) [29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1132(a)(2)] to seek appropriate relief under ERISA \u00a7 409  \n[29 U.S .C. \u00a7 1109] , the Claimant\u2019 s remedy, if  any, shall be \nlimited to (i) the alleged losses to the Claimant\u2019 s individual  \nPlan account resulting from the alleged breach of fiduciary \nduty, (ii) a pro- rated portion of any profits allegedly made by \na fiduciary through the use of Plan assets where  such pro- rated \namount is intended to provide a remedy solely to Claimant \u2019s \nindividual  Plan account, and/or (iii) such other remedial or \nequitable relief as the  arbitrator deems proper so long as such \nremedial or equitable r elief does not include  or result in the \nprovision of additional benefits or monetary relief to any Employee, Participant or Beneficiary other than the Claimant, \nand is not binding on the  Administrator or Trustee with respect \nto any Employee, Participant or Beneficiary  other than the \nClaimant. The requirement that (x) all Covered Claims be brought  solely in a Claimant\u2019 s individual capacity and not in a \npurported group, class, collective, or representative capacity, \nand (y) that no Claimant shal l be entitled to  receive, and shall \nnot be awarded, any relief other than individual relief, shall govern irrespective of any AAA rule or decision to the \ncontrary and is a material and nonseverable  term of this \nSection 18.7, Mandatory and Binding Arbitrati on Procedure  \n(\u201cArbitration Procedure \u201d). In the event that the requirements \nof this subsection (the  \u201cClass Action Waiver \u201d) were to be \nfound unenforceable or invalid by the court  specified in \nSection 18.8, then the entire Arbitration Procedure (i.e., all of Section 18.7)  shall be rendered null and void in all respects. \nExcept as to the applicability and enforceability of the \nforegoing Class Action Waiver, the arbitrator(s) shall have  \nexclusive authority to resolve any dispute or issue of arbitrability with re spect to this  Arbitration Procedure, 5 \n including as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator(s) or relating \nto the existence, scope, validity, enforceability, or \nperformance of this Arbitration  Procedure or any of its \nprovisions. Any dispute or issue as to the applicability or  \nvalidity of the Class Action Waiver shall be determined solely \nby the court specified in Section 18.8. . . . \n \n18.8  Restriction on Venue.   If a Claimant wishes to pursue any \nCovered Claim, that Claimant shall comply with the \nArbitration Procedure, set forth in Section 18.7 of the Plan, and shall not file  any such claim in a state or federal court. To \nthe extent, however, any Claimant . . . wishes to challenge the legal enforceability of the  Arbitration Procedure, or to the \nextent the Arbitration Procedure is invalidated, such action or  \nchallenge shall be filed exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware  or any Delaware \nState Court  . . . . \n (D.I. 26, Ex. A  \u00a7\u00a7 18.7\u20138.)   \n \nDefendants  filed a motion seeking to compel  arbitration of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims  in accordance \nwith the arbitration provision in the Plan Document .  (D.I. 24.)   Plaintiffs oppose.  Judge Andrews \nreferred the motion to me on July 15, 2022, after briefing was complete.  (D.I. 25\u201329, 32.)  The \nparties filed numerous supplemental briefs and notices of additional authority, all of which have \nbeen considered.  (D.I. 33, 34, 38, 41, 44, 45.)  The Court heard oral argument on October 27, \n2022.  (\u201cTr. __ .\u201d)   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cThe Federal Arbitration Act reflects the \u2018national policy favoring arbitration and places \narbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts.\u2019\u201d  In re Remicade (Direct \nPurchaser) Antitrust Litig., 938 F.3d 515, 519 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 443 (2006)).  Its primary substantive provision says that \u201c[a] \nwritten provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by \narbitration a controversy . . . arising out of such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and 6 \n enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d  \n9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.  It requires that the Court, \u201cupon being satisfied that [an] issue i nvolved in [a] suit or \nproceeding is referable to arbitration\u201d under an arbitration agreement, \u201cshall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement . . . .\u201d  9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3.  It also authorizes courts to issue orders compelling arbitration in the manner provided for in  an arbitration  agreement .  9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4; Prima Paint Corp. \nv. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 404 (1967). \nTo determine whether an issu e in a suit or proceeding is \u201creferable to arbitration\u201d within \nthe meaning of the FAA , courts \u201cmust consider two \u2018gateway\u2019 questions: (1) \u2018whether the parties \nhave a valid arbitration agreement at all\u2019 (i.e., its enforceability), and (2) \u2018whether a concede dly \nbinding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy\u2019 (i.e., its scope).\u201d  In re Remicade, 938 F.3d at 519 (quoting Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 139 S. Ct. 1407, 1416\u201317 (2019)).   \nIII. DISCUSSIO N \nOn its face, the arbitration provision appears to require Plaintiffs to bring their ERISA  \nbreach of fiduciary duty claims in arbitration .  Plaintiffs , however, offer  three independent reasons \nwhy they should not be compelled to arbitrate .  First,  they say that the Plan  Document  is a \n\u201ccontract[] for employment\u201d for a \u201cclass of workers engaged in . . . interstate commerce\u201d and is therefore exempt from the FAA.  See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.  Second, Plaintiffs contend that the arbitration provision should not be enforced because they never consented to it.  Third, they contend that the arbitration provision is invalid because it precludes Plan participants from seeking substantive  \nstatutory remedies provided by ERISA.  Because I agree with Plaintiffs\u2019 last argument, I do not \nconsider the first two.   7 \n A. The arbitration provision eliminates statutory remedies and is thus invalid.  \nThe FAA mandates that courts enforce \u201cagreement [s] for arbitration\u201d according to their  \nterms.  9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4;  Am. Exp. Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 570 U.S. 228, 233 (2013) .  But t hat \ndoesn\u2019t mean \u2014and the Supreme Court has never said\u2014that  the FAA requires  courts to enforce \nany and every provision in an agreement just because it\u2019s  titled  \u201cArbitration Agreement.\u201d  See \nViking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana, 142 S. Ct. 1906, 1919 n.5 (2022) (explaining that the FAA \n\u201crequires only the enforcement of \u2018provision[s]\u2019 to settle a controversy \u2018by arbitration,\u2019 and not any provision that happens to appear in a contract that features an arbit ration clause\u201d (quoting 9 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2)).   \nTo be sure, the FAA  directs courts to \u201crespect and enforce the parties\u2019 chosen arbitration \nprocedures .\u201d  Epic Sys.  Corp., v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1621 (2018) (emphasis added) .  Thus , if \nan arbitration agreement specifies  the procedural  \u201crules under which th[e]  arbitration must be \nconducted,\u201d  a court has to enforce that  agreement.  Italian Colors , 570 U.S. at  233.  And if the \nparties agreed to forego the availability of a class action procedur e in the arbitration , a court must \nlikewise enforce that  agreement .  Id. at 233\u201338 (holding that the FAA required enforcement of an \narbitration agreement containing a class  action waiver , which required plaintiff s to pursue their \nfederal antitrust claim in bilateral arbitration).    \nBut w hile the FAA requires courts to respect parties \u2019 contractual agreements regarding the \nprocedures  under which they will arbitrate, \u201c the FAA  does not r equire courts to enforce contractual \nwaivers of substantive  rights and remedies.\u201d  Viking River Cruises, 142 S. Ct. at 1919 (emphasis \nadded)  (\u201cAn arbitration agreement thus does not alter or abridge substantive rights; it merely \nchanges how those rights will be processed. \u201d).  Indeed, not only does the FAA not require courts  \nto enforce an  agreement to  waive a substantive remedy , but such an agreement will usually  be held 8 \n invalid as against public policy.  Mitsubishi Motor Corp. v. Soler Chrysler -Plymouth, Inc., 473 \nU.S. 614, 637 n.19 (1985)  (explaining that an agreement to prospectively waive \u201c a party\u2019s right to \npursue statutory remedies \u201d for federal antitrust violations would be invalid as against public \npolicy) ; see also , e.g., Italian Colors , 570 U .S. at 235\u201336 (explaining that \u201ca provision in an \narbitration agreement forbidding the assertion of certain statutory rights \u201d would \u201ccertainly\u201d be an \ninvalid \u201cprospective waiver of a party\u2019s right to pursue statutory remedies\u201d ); 14 Penn Plaza LLC \nv. Pyett , 556 U.S. 247, 27 3 (2009)  (\u201c[A] substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will \nnot be upheld . . . .\u201d ); William s v. Medley Opportunity Fund II , LP, 965 F.3d 229, 241\u201343 (3d. Cir. \n2020) ( holding invalid as against public policy an arbitration agreement that purported to waive \nthe plaintiff\u2019s right to bring a federal RICO  claim ); Hadnot v. Bay, Ltd., 344 F.3d 474, 478 n.14 \n(5th Cir. 2003) ( holding unenforceable a  portion of an  arbitration clause that eliminated the \navailability of punitive damages under Title VII ).   \nWith those principles in mind , the question the  Court must answer  is whether the arbitration \nprovision in the  Plan Document is merely  an agreement regarding the procedures and manner in \nwhich the arbitration will be conducted (as Defendants contend) , which the FAA says must be \nenforced, or whether it operates as a prospective waiver of  Plaintiffs\u2019 substantive statutory right \nunder ERISA to seek relief on behalf of the Plan  for all losses suffered by the Plan (as Plaintiffs \ncontend) , in which case it is unenforceable.  T o answer that question, it is necessary to take a closer \nlook at the  nature of the ERISA remedies requested  by Plaintiffs .    \nAs noted above, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Plan \nby causing it to pay more for company stock than it was worth.  ERISA says that a plan fiduciary \nowes  certain enumerated fiduciary duties to the plan, and it provides a mechanism for beneficiaries \nto enforce those duties.  In particular, \u00a7 1109(a)  of Title 29 provides that  9 \n (a) Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who \nbreaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed \nupon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary \nwhich have been made through use of assets of the plan by the \nfiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial \nrelief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such fiduciary. . . .  \n \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a).  Among other things , \u00a7 1109(a)  says that a plan fiduciary who breaches its \nfiduciary duties is liable \u201cto such plan\u201d  for \u201cany losses to the plan.\u201d   29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a)  (emphasis \nadded).  It also allows  the equitable remedy of removal of a plan fiduciary.  ( Id.)  Section \n1132(a)(2) authorizes a civil action to enforce \u00a7 1109.  It says that an  \u201caction may be brought  . . . \n(2) by the Secretary, or by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section \n1109 of this title .\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2).   \nPlaintiffs\u2019  Complaint s eeks remedies  \u201con behalf of the Plan\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 1132(a)(2) and \n1109(a) , including (among other things)  (i) an order directing Defendants to pay to the Plan all of \nthe losses suffered by the Plan as a result of Defendants\u2019 fiduciary duty breache s and (ii) removal \nof Defendants as fiduciaries.  The Complaint  does not seek to recover any individual beneficiary \nlosses distinct from the losses suffered by the Plan itself as a result of the alleged breaches.  Cf.  \nMass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell , 473 U.S. 134, 145 (1985)  (explaining that \u00a7 1132(a)(2) does \nnot provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries); LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg \n& Assocs., Inc., 552 U.S. 248, 256 (2008)  (same) ; In re Schering Plough Corp. ERISA Litig., 589 \nF.3d 585, 594 (3d Cir. 2009)  (\u201cSecti on [1132(a)(2)] claims are, by their nature, plan claims .\u201d).     \nNow that we understand the nature of the remedies  sought by Plaintiffs , the next step is to \nconsider whether the  arbitration procedure in the Plan Document \u201c effects an \u2018 elimination of \n[Plaintiffs\u2019] right to pursue [ those ] remed [ies].\u2019\u201d  Williams , 965 F.3d at  242 (quoting Italian 10 \n Colors , 570 U.S. at 236).   The Plan Document  requires all \u201cBeneficiar[ies]\u201d to resolve all \u201cCovered \nClaims ,\u201d including ERISA breach of fiduciary duty claims , according to the arbitration procedure \nset forth in \u00a7 18.7.  (D.I. 26, Ex. A \u00a7 18.7.)   The re is no dispute that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim s under \n\u00a7\u00a7 1109(a)  and 1132(a)(2)  are covered  and are therefore subject to the arbitration procedure  in \n\u00a7 18.7.  See Pritzker  v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. , 7 F.3d 1110, 1122 (3d Cir. \n1993) (holding that ERISA claims are generally arbitrable) . \nSection 18.7(b) goes on to say that Covered Claims \u201cmust be brought solely in the \nClaimant\u2019s individual capacity and not in a representative capacity.\u201d  ( D.I. 26, Ex. A \u00a7 18.7(b) .)  \nIt further says that , with respect to suits brought under \u00a7 1132(a)(2) for relief under \u00a7  1109\u2014i.e. , \nthe type of suit here \u2014the monetary remedy the Claimant can obtain is  \u201climited to (i) the alleged \nlosses to the Claimant\u2019 s individual Plan account resulting from the alleged breach of fiduciary \nduty, [and/or]  (ii) a pro -rated portion of any profits allegedly made by a fiduciary through the use \nof Plan assets where such pro- rated amount is intended to provide a remedy solely to Claimant \u2019s \nindividual Plan account  . . . .\u201d  ( Id.)  It also says that the arbitrator  may gran t remedial or equitable \nrelief, but only if it \u201c does not include or result in the provision of additional benefits or monetary \nrelief to any Employee, Participant or Beneficiary other than the Claimant, and is not binding on \nthe Administrator or T rustee with respect to any Employee, Participant or Beneficiary other than \nthe Claimant. \u201d  (Id.)  \nPlaintiffs contend that \u00a7 18.7(b)  eliminates their ability to obtain the equitable remedy of \nfiduciary removal as well as their right to seek monetary relief to make the Plan whole.  Defendants say that  the provision \u201cdoes not necessarily\u201d prevent  a prospective plaintiff f rom seeking the \nremedy of fiduciary removal  in the arbitration .  (D.I. 28 at 8 n.13; see also Tr. 19\u201321.)   But \nDefendants agree that \u00a7 18.7(b)  purports to limit a plaintiff\u2019s  monetary remed ies to relief for their 11 own individual account ,  and that it does not permit a plaintiff to seek plan -wide monetary relief . \n(D.I. 25 at 15.)   \nPlaintiffs say that the elimination of their right to seek plan -wide monetary relief is an \nimpermissible prospective waiver of their right to the statutory remedy provided by \u00a7\u00a7 1109(a)  \nand 1132(a)(2), and is therefore unenforceable.  I agree.3 \nPared  down to its simplest form , the analysis is this :  The ERISA statute gives plan \nbeneficiaries the right to sue  on behalf of a plan and recover plan -wide damages  for a breach of \nfiduciary duty.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1109(a) , 1132(a)(2).  But what the statute provides, the arbitration \nprovision takes  away: it says that beneficiaries cannot sue on behalf of the P lan and that they \ncannot recover plan -wide damages.  (D.I. 26, Ex. A \u00a7 18.7.)  The arbitration provision thus \neliminates a right to pursue a remedy provided by a federal statute.   The FAA does not requir e a \ncourt to enforce a  provision in an arbitration  agreement that effects an elimination of a statutory  \nright to pursue a remedy.  Williams , 965 F.3d at 241\u201342.  Moreover, an arbitration provision that \neliminates the  right to  pursue a remedy  provided by ERISA  is invalid as against public policy. 3F4 \nThus, the  clause  in \u00a7 18.7(b) of the arbitration procedure that purports to bar Plaintiffs from seeking \nplan-wide relief is invalid and will not be enforced.  And because \u00a7 18.7(b) says that the entirety \nof the arbitration provision in \u00a7 18.7 \u201cshall be rendered null and void in all respects\u201d if \u00a7 18.7(b) \nis unenforceable ( see Tr. 26), Defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration should be denied. \n3 Defendants do not dispute  that the Court, not the arbitrator, should consider whether \u00a7 18.7(b) \neffects a waiver of a substantive right.  (Tr. 26; see also D.I. 26, Ex. A \u00a7 18.7(b) (\u201cAny dispute or \nissue as to the applicability or validity of [\u00a7  18.7(b)] shall be determined solely by the court . . . \n.\u201d).)  \n4 Such a provision is also likely void under ERISA itself.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110(a) (\u201c[A]ny \nprovision in an agreement or instrument which purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility or liability for any responsibility, obligation, or duty under this part shall be void as against public  \npolicy.\u201d).  \n 12 My conclusion is consistent with other courts  t hat have recently considered similar \nprovisions.  In Harrison v. Envision Management Holding, Inc. Board of Directors , 593 F. Supp. \n3d 1078 (D. Colo. 2022), the court held that a nearly identical arbitration procedure in an ESOP \nplan document was unenforceable because it disallowed plan- wide relief under \u00a7\u00a7 1109 (a) and \n1132(a)(2) .  Harrison , 593 F. Supp 3d at 1085 (holding that the plaintiff was \u201cunable to effectively \nvindicate his statutory cause of action\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 1109(a)  and 1132(a)(2) under an arbitration \nprovision that disallowed litigants from seeking plan- wide remedies) .  Likewise, the court in \nCedeno v. Argent Trust Co., No. 20- 9987, 2021 WL 5087898 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2021) , considered  \nanother nearly identical arbitration provision and came to the same conclusion.  Cedeno , 2021 WL \n5087898, at *4 (holding that a n arbitration  provision limiting a prospective plaintiff\u2019s relief to \nlosses to his own individual account \u201cis invalid and unenforceable because it purports to limit the available remedies that ERISA explicitly provides\u201d).  The opinions in Harrison  and Cedeno are \npersuasive, and I agree with their reasoning.\n5 \nB. Defendants \u2019 arguments are unpersuasive.\nDefendants\u2019 remaining arguments  should be rejected .  Defendants contend that a \nparticipant in a defined contribution plan does not have a substantive right to recover plan- wide \nlosses; rather, his relief under \u00a7\u00a7 1109(a)  and 1132(a)(2) is limited to relief for h is individual plan \naccount.  In support of that proposition, Defendants point to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in \n5 My conclusion is also consistent with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s analysis in Smith v. B oard of \nDirectors of Triad Manufacturing, Inc., 13 F.4th 613 (7th Cir. 2021) .  In that case, the court \nconcluded that a  nearly identical arbitration provision was unenforceable because it prohibit ed \nequitable remedies  that ERISA expressly permits .  Id. at 621\u201322.  The  Smith  court (unlike \nDefendants here)  interpreted  the arbitration provision at issue to  preclude a participant from \nseeking the remedy of fiduciary removal, a remedy authorized by \u00a7 1109(a) .  The court held that \nthe provision operated as a \u201cprospective waiver of a party\u2019s right to pursue statutory remedies\u201d \nand was thus invalid.  Id.  at 621 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors , 473 U.S. at 637 n.19). 13 LaR ue v. DeWolff, Boberg & Associates, 552 U.S. 248 (2008) .  In that case, the Supreme Court \nheld that a participant could obtain relief on behalf of the plan for losses to that participant\u2019s own \nretirement account where the alleged breaches only caused losses to that participant\u2019s individual \nretirement account.  But LaRue  did not say\u2014and the Third Circuit  has never said \u2014that an ESOP \nparticipant bringing a claim  under \u00a7\u00a7 1109(a)  and 1132(a)(2) may  recover only the losses to his \nretirement account  where the alleged breach of fiduciary duty affected the entire plan . 5F6  See \nCedeno , 2021 WL 5087898, at *4 (rejecting the argument that LaRue  stands for the proposition \nthat an individual participant in a defined contribution plan can only seek relief for his personal losses) ; see also In re Schering Plough Corp. ERISA Litig., 589 F.3d 585, 595 n.9 (3d Cir. 2009)  \n(\u201c[T]he contention  that LaRue establishes that there are no \u2018plan claims\u2019 in the defined contribution \ncontext is incorrect.\u201d) .  The statute says that a participant may sue to recover \u201cany losses due to \nthe plan.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a) ; LaRue , 552 U.S. at 253 (explaining that \u00a7 1132(a)(2) authorizes \nplan beneficiaries \u201cto bring actions on behalf of a plan to recover for violations of the obligations defined in [\u00a7 1109(a)]\u201d).  Defendants\u2019 contention that the statute does not confer on a beneficiary the right to seek a plan -wide remedy is unpersuasive.\n7     \n6 To the contrary, courts have permitted plaintiffs to obtain plan- wide monetary relief on behalf \nof the plan in cases where a fiduciary duty breach  caused loss to the plan.  See, e.g. , Browe v. CTC \nCorp., 15 F.4th 175, 197\u201399 (2d Cir. 2021) (reversing district court\u2019s limitation on loss restoration \nfor plaintiffs in defined contribution plan; explaining that courts \u201care not entitled to disregard \n[Congress\u2019s] legislative judgment\u201d requiring fiduciary to \u201cmake good any losses resulting from his breach\u201d); Brundle ex re l. Constellis Emp. Stock Ownership Plan v. Wilmington Tr., N.A. , 919 \nF.3d 763, 781 (4th Cir. 2019), as amended (Mar. 22, 2019) ; Perez v. Bruister , 823 F.3d 250, 265\u2013\n76 (5th Cir. 2016) ; Cedeno , 2021 WL 5087898, at *4 (collecting cases) .\n7 But see Dorman v. Charles Schwab Corp., 780 Fed. App\u2019x 510, 514 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(unpublished memorandum opinion) (reasoning that LaRue  stands for the proposition that \n\u00a7 1132(a)(2) claims \u201care inherently individualized when brought in the context of a defined\ncontribution plan\u201d) .  I disagree with Dorman , and other courts have too.  See Cedeno, 2021 WL\n5087898, at *5 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2021)  (expressly rejecting Dorman \u2019s interpretation of\nLaRue ); Smith v. Greatbanc Tr. Co., No. 20- 2350, 2020 WL 4926560, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 21,14 \n Moreover , the fact that the statute itself allows a single plaintiff to obtain plan -wide relief \nmakes  this case totally different than the class action waiver cases cited by Defendants .  For \nexample, in Italian Colors  and Epic Systems , the Supreme Court considered the enforceability of \narbitration agreements that contained class action waivers , which operated to prohibit the plaintiff \nin each case from utilizing the class action procedural device  to aggregate his individual claims \nwith the claims of other similarly situated  individuals .  See Viking River , 142 S. Ct. at 1920 \n(explaining that \u201cclass -action procedure allows courts to use a representative plaintiff\u2019s  individual \nclaim as a basis to adjudicate the individual claims of multiple parties at once , instead of in separate \nsuits\u201d (cleaned up)).   I n those  cases, the arbitration agreements  did not prevent the plaintiffs from \nvindicating their substantive right to the individual remedy provided by the relevant statute, and \nthe Supreme Court held that the class action waiver s were enforceable.   See Epic Sys. , 138 S. Ct. \nat 16 21 (explaining that the FAA \u201cseems to protect pretty absolutely\u201d an arbitration agreement \nrequiring \u201cindividualized rather than class or collective action procedures\u201d to resolve an individual \nemployee\u2019s Fair Labor Standards Act claim ); Italian Colors , 570 U.S. at 236 (\u201cThe class -action \nwaiver merely limits to  the two contracting parties.  It no more eliminates those parties \u2019 right to \npursue their statutory remedy than did federal law before its adoption of the class action for legal relief in 1938.\u201d  (citation omitted) ). \nHere, in contrast, Plaintiffs are not trying to aggregate their individual claims with the \nindividual claims of other P lan beneficiaries.  Plaintiffs are asserting  a breach of fiduciary duty \nclaim on behalf of the P lan, and they seek a plan-wide remedy, as expressly provided by the statute.   \n \n2020)  (\u201cThis Court respectfully disagrees with [ Dorman\u2019s ] interpretation of LaRue .\u201d), aff\u2019d , 13 \nF.4th 613 (7th Cir. 2021) ; cf. Henry ex rel. BSC Ventures Holdings, Inc. Emp. Stock Ownership \nPlan v. Wilmington Tr., N.A., No. 19- 1925- MN, 2021 WL 4133622, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. 10, 2021)  \n(declining to follow a different aspect of Dorman , noting that it \u201cprovided no reas oning for its \ndecision\u201d).  15 \n Unlike the class  action waiver s at issue in Italian Colors  and Epic Systems , the arbitration provision \nhere does not  merely  purport to change the manner in which Plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims are \ndecided ; rather , it purports to change the nature of the substantive remedy provided by the statute.  \nIt deprives Plaintiffs of the right to seek the statutory remedy  of plan- wide monetary relief , and it \nis therefore unenforceable.  \nI reject  Defendants\u2019 suggestion that  my conclusion is inconsistent with the Third Circuit\u2019s \nholding in Williams .  In that case, the Third Circuit considered an arbitration agreement that limited \na party\u2019s substantive claims to those arising under tribal law.  Williams , 965 F.3d at 238.  Because \nthe agreement operated to \u201cprospectively waive\u201d all federal statutory claims, including the \nplaintiff\u2019s RICO claim, the court held that the agreement was unenforceable.  Id.   Defendants \nsuggest that Williams  stands for the  proposition that the \u201cprospective waiver \u201d doctrine only applies \nto invalidate an arbitration agreement if the agreement entirely forbids a prospective plaintiff from \nbringing a claim under a statute.   (D.I. 25 at 16\u201317.)  I disagree.  While that was the problem  with \nthe arbitration agreement  in that case, neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit has ever so \nheld.  And Defendants\u2019 position is contrary to the Third Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Williams that the \nappropriate framing of the prospective waiver questi on is whether the arbitration provision effects \nan elimination of the right to pursue a remedy provided by a  statute.  Williams , 965 F.3d at 241\u2013\n42; see also id. at 238 (\u201c[A]rbitration is only appropriate so long as the prospective litigant \neffectively may  vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum.\u201d  (citation \nomitted )); Harrison , 593 F. Supp. 3d at 1085 (\u201c[N] othing in . . . Williams  suggests that an \narbitration agreement is invalid only if it forecloses all  causes of action. \u201d). The arbitration \nprovision in this case eliminates the statutory right to pursue plan- wide relief.  It is therefore \nunenforceable.  See Harrison , 593 F. Supp. 3d at 1085 (holding an arbitration provision 16 \n unenforceable because it \u201cdisallows a litigant from seeking plan -wide remedies ,\u201d resulting in the \nprospective plaintiff being \u201cunable to effectively vindicate his statutory cause of action in the \narbitral forum \u201d).   \nFinally, Defendants contend that \u201cPlaintiffs are asking the Court to find that ERISA and \nthe FAA cannot be harmonized.\u201d   (D.I. 28 at 4.)  That reflects a misunderstanding of  Plaintiffs \u2019 \nargument.  Plaintiffs are not saying that  ERISA conflicts with the FAA.  Rather, their argument  is \nthat the Plan Document conflicts with ERISA.  The  Plan Document contains a provision that bars \na beneficiary from pursuing a remedy that  ERISA  provides .  That provision is invalid , and the \nFAA does not require the Court to enforce it .   \nThe Court cannot sever the  invalid provision and enforce the remainder of the arbitration \nprocedure  because the  Plan Document  itself says that the invalid  provision is not severable .  (D.I. \n26, Ex. A \u00a7 18.7(b) .)  In other words , the Court is not declining to send this case to arbitration \nbecause of something unique about  ERISA.  ERISA claims are arbitrable.  It is the Plan \nDocument \u2019s own non- severability provision that keeps this case h ere in court.    \nIV.
